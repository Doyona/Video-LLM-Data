Lmao this is why I bought 2k21 for 15 bucks off Kijiji. I will never give 2k a dime ever again. Fk Ronnie
2k21 is smoother tho
postgame inteviews are back or not for last gen or same shit as 21
Nba 2k22 looks way better than nba 2k21
Bruh I spent 100 dollars for my cover to be Kobe and it stayed as Zion and I got next gen shit still has me tight
Are we just going to skip over the fact that Dirk said that he didn’t know who the other guys were that are on the cover with him? Bruh..
Do they play  the  game  fix the d in the game or make it balance off to def
Made a mistake buying this years 2k. Not gonna let these scammers get me this year.
Unsubscribed. You dropping too much click bait now a days
It's always nice watching the lights turn on in people's heads.
Let’s go 100$ edition I get both gens and 100k vc
I play pc 2k I think it would be cool if we could play next gen. The only problem is the hackers will probably ruin the next gen experience
Why? Because it's copy-paste. Like every year.
Current gen better be lit or they in for another slow ass year lmfao 🤣
Can we jus get rid of my career and het a free 99 overall this year ain't nobody tryna grind the same.fucking thing for 3 years str8 gtfoh
I’ve watched the Trailer so many times and lemme be honest, no matter WHAT you say about the game, it’s FIRE 🔥
Why do you play like every AS2 bum 😂
2k be worth it when it’s on sale for $20. Anything more than that. Nah
They need to make the 1st my player free
Thanks for the video homie. You keep going in and out of focus as you sway in your chair..hurts the eyes to watch after awhile
I have faith in this one but I’m not gonna buy till I se gameplay
2k17 best 2k of all time
Whyyyy do y’all keep giving these mafffkkaas your money????
Seriously how much y’all expect to change in a sports game
2k15 dribble system and 16 game play sheesh
someone tell agent to curve his brim
It's been a year since I've last watched Agent. Wow he is so slim right now great for him ♥️
2k could just launch a DLC every year. The graphic is good enough, improving the gameplay would be better
It would be awesome if 2k and live make a basketball game together….like 2k gameplay but nba live design … playin park in Rucker park would be sick😭😭
2k can’t miss because it’s the ONLY basketball game
Feel like we hate 2k sometimes but we can’t stop playin ut
U know y.cuz we can't do shit about it
They need to add the dunk competition like nba live
I just want nba socks for expansion teams lol
they doing the same shit🤦🏿‍♂️
Gameplay wise in the park I would never go back to current gen after playing new gen
Copy paste nation 😎
Horrible take
because it is
But u can rapper is what ronnie saying rn
2k17 still the best 2k out 🚫🧢
They should make play now and play now online free seeing as they never EVER make any updates to it and some people just wanna play a game without all the customization
Crossplay 2k? Agent you reaching 😂😂
Reddit for the win.😂
wnba edition will have a squirt contest mode   source : reddit
Unless they completely remaster the gameplay we all have to boycott.
Looking slim there my dude proud of you!!💪🏽💪🏽
is it me or does agent sound sick hope hes doing good 💙📌‼️‼️
I hate 2k
Most of you said you will not buy the game this year but I think you still buy it.
hopefully we can get the old shot meter back
agent can you pls explain on how you feel about Lolo
I know this outta k ow where but I Wanna say this, I have no idea wit what updates/ Game changes,  Community changes as in just stuff for the community, Events shit like dat or new 2k YouTubers and all dat like I really didn't even play 2k this year except for when it came out and a lil Myleague off and on like really it seems for me at least my experience got ruined with Zens and The new gen consoles cuz there putting more effort for the new gen a better story mode and shit I Mena I know there's still problems and shit but like you know what I'm tryna say? Like if played every 2k intell the next since at least 2k10 maybe 2k11 but this year I know nothing bout the game any glitches ANYTHING like that and it sucks cuz I loved this game to it used to bring light in my life ngl especially thru the hard times but alot of my friends went on to the new consoles or it's just cuz I stopped playing cuz how bad I was and the game was like I just couldn't alot of people and just in general things ruined the game so I'm tryna catch up be apart of the community and shit like I know it's not a big of a deal but 2k is like your favorite most hated show that never ends yk😂 so if you read all dis thank you and if you could or would, Would you plz tell me pretty much anything I need to know about the game from this year and anything to catch me up just for this year's game cuz I'm going back on my shit feel me😂.  Just one last thing ngl I wish the new consoles didn't come out cuz 2k already has had a hard time on the last 2 2ks and I know sum might say the last 3, (19, 20, And 21) and I disagree 19 was really good but anyways with new consoles they pretty much or at least to them gotta make 2 games now, And plus in a couple of years the Xbox 1 and PS4 Is Gon be treated like how 2k treated the Xbox 360 and PS3 once when the Xbox 1 and PS4 but I know that's not what there doing now cuz when the Xbox 1 and PS4 Came out it was the start of a new generation of gaming, And the new consoles right now are just and upgrade to that so there gonna try, or keep up Having good quality, well made games😂 for both consoles but I just like it when it was simple and Just Xbox 1 and PS4 And 2k just tryna do good,l Fix they game😂 and that's all.
I don’t care that it took a while for these YouTubers to realize this.  I’m just glad they realized at all.
I love how 2K players are always pouring their hearts out to 2K every year begging for improvements and dishing out ultimatums all the while 2K just nods politely and smiles thinking "Whatever, you ain't going nowhere."
You guys are just now realizing the game is the same every year? Every year dudes saying they won’t buy the game this year and then they cave lmao. It’s people’s own fault the game is shitty, the game hasn’t been fun for like over half a decade lmao
I’m thinking about buying nba2k21 or should I wait for the new one?
The probably gonna have the same builder to
Bro idk if imma buy this.
Please put the 2s court close to spawn
"Why does 2k22 look like 2k21"..... BECAUSE WE ALL KEEP BUYING IT EVERY YEAR! why change it if we'll pay $60 for a roster update.
Damn I feel bad cause it will be the same game. Graphics ,gameplay and systems
When did he actually get tot eh topic of the video?
Might as well just keep 2k21 and save your money its the same thing
Yo how tf y’all being wanting the games to look like ? Naw fr ? Y’all be wanting a whole different game from the previous year but when they change shit y’all get mad Smfh this shit crazy ppl love to be mad I swea
Why are you surprised
Stop buying the damn game every single year and maybe they’ll actually put an effort in
2k21 pt 2
We on a cruise ship in 2k22 lmao
9:26 THEY’VE BEEN TRYING NEW THINGS FOR 4 YEARS AND IT HASNT BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE 2K18 DROPPED THINGS HASNT BEEN THE SAME
They Needa bring back the 21 court from 16&17. 1v1v1
Agent 00💞is the best
The cover is Candace parker
They are just capitalizing off our love for basketball. Do enough to sell it but not enough to make you keep it smh how does a best selling sports game have below 2 stars in consecutive years and still remain “best selling”. WE NEED A NEW BASKETBALL GAME
Damm I used to be a huge fan of 2K. I skipped 2k21 and not sure if imma get 2k22. I can’t believe I’m saying that 😞
Okay here is the thing  no affiliations because I played next gen for abt a month and it was not really fun the map was huge and not much people in other affiliations so many people were in north side nights but still having op builds that are 7’3 speed boosting and dribbling and shooting is not fun no skill in the game and we need to games there so many people just sitting around I think we should 3 2s and just keep 6 3s  and there should be more diversity in the game and new rep that’s what everyone wants and personality the rep system is so slow I mean at-least  for me I am not on the game all day throwing lobs from all star 2 and up should get a little challenging and to need more games and stuff but ones u hit say ss2 and up it gets way more challenging or just keep the same system but new rewards and some new clothes and we can customize or we can put like a jersey over a hoodie that would be so cool and those are my thoughts  Edit: im a as3 and I just got back to current gen
Worst games ever made devs should get fired 2K21 worst in game mechanics ever
Y did 2k21 look like 2k20
No demo means u can't see 🙈 how bad it is lol 😆
They need to fix the shorts disappearing or looking wrinkling up
I remember Shaq having pg speed on 2k20
Like I said before. Pawn shop $5 Walmart roll back 12.99 to 19.99 to 29.99 or catch it when it get misprice hint hint Walmart lol 😂 or free from Member ships pass
And 2k20 lol
At least somebody said it, if they keep going back instead of just adding new stuff, people will just say “This is the same as last year, we want something thing new”. Now don’t get me wrong, 2k is definitely 98% ass, but I’d rather them adding something new each year. Ngl I loved my stick shooting and was mad asl when they patched it😭😭
2k will not I repeat 2k will not get my money this yr this is ridiculous
only way it changes is if we don’t buy the game 😅
NBA 2k is bad but imagine if it was EA.
2k is gonna continue  to do the least because  people keep buying it. Its crazy cause you guys cant break away from it. STOP BUYING IT! Youve been playing the same game with minor uploads and tweaks every year.
Look like ima stay my ass on 2k21 all year
Keep in mind there’s new deve
I never got none of my preorder shit from last year just 2k emailing me saying they gave it to me when I kept sending proof they didn’t so I’m game sharing this one
cause 2k is trash
Y’all complain every year and still buy the game lol 😂😂😂
1:20 I think the WNBA version is like the 80 dollar version of the game that has a few bonuses but not as much as the legend
Covers look pretty sic imo, but besides that....... My expectations for 2k22 are set VERY low, because I expect to be disappointed
Yall have been saying it was a make or break year forever. They spent 2 years making the next gen game, they aren't going to change it that much.
Eid Mubarak!
Every time i say: its the same game.why spend 40 bucks? And i still do it because i have nothing else to do lol. Im wasting my money. :/ and i can't stop myself lol
They’re finally learning.
They only focus on mycareer.  I need Weekly wheater sim , Every dribble NBA/and1 mixtape... if fifa can have every dribble move so can 2k. Etc etc
idc as long as the gameplay is good
It’s the same game every year tf you expect 🤡
Everyone gets excited because it's the only damn basketball game we have
See I play 2k on pc there were WAY to many hackers this year I know 2k probably won’t do anything but just wanna put that out there
Looks like you gotta do another cameo video lol
Yo agent if you call getting the ball stolen during a check pass at the start of the game fun, you must be whilin. Or running into a barrier after jumping and catching a ball before it goes out of bounds u must be WHILIN. 2k is buggy and we should never ever defend them and call it “fun”
If they having record profits , then who buying it ?
no disrespect, but you cant be rocking back and forth in your seat in 8k, your face gets blurry and with the background already blurred, its just too much. its nauseating. 4k should be fine. Love the video though. you always make good videos
I don’t have a issue with the game being more realistic that’s what makes it fun for me i don’t play my park/city so while most people complain about that part of the game i have a absolutely no issues with the gameplay. Me and my guys play in person tournaments and none of us complain about the game🤷🏽‍♂️
Will there be new hairstyles in 2k22 current gen
Yo agent , idk if you will read this ,but i i haven't watched your videos since i stoped playing around when 2k18 came out. Just wanna say you look amazing fam , healthy . Keep up the good work !
Theirs going to be no demo same shit especially on current gen
You say make or break every year
I need 2k19 vibes back best 2k personally
2k about to sale people the same trash that they've been selling for years, same errors same problems but its the people's fault because they keep buying it
I like how they say consoles instead of platforms because pc is a lost cause
Does anyone know how the shot meter will be
The same game part 22
That's why they gave out 2k21 for free on Epic games, to get those none 2K buyer's that only play fortnite to hopefully join the community in buying 2k22 since its the newer version of a game they semi like but got for free. Sadly enough, it might work too.
Nice clickbait
imagine paying more to play the game less
Every year we’re going through the same problems through out the year the it’s a new game before we can even enjoy the first game. F 2k im not buying that sh$t no more.
So does 2k22 have cross play like xbox to ps4?
I DONT WANNA HEAR SHIT CUZ YALL KEEP BUYING THE SHIT
any sports game is just updated rosters and slightly better graphics so u sport video game fans are brain dead. its the same thing over and over again.
if live drops bet is gonna be cross play watch
you say it cost money to implement cross play wth 2k do got money with all the money hungry that they do smh
They might as well make this shit MyTeam2k22 They Show The Most Love To The feens who just blow money on they mediocre ass game
After 19 I was done with 2k
imagine paying for update
They don't improve the game because they don't have to.. there's no real competition in their genre. They behave like McDonalds and their Ice Cream machines it's part of the franchise to stay defect.
Need a park, no city plsssss
Oh wow thats why the game sucks,  it's owned by who it is, same as movies,  Chinese storylines , money over quality
Ahhhhh you’re starting to catch on I see
so agent what happens if i get the anniversary on ps4 play it on there and then load up on the ps5 🤷🏾‍♂️
Y’all weird and toxic 2k is a great basketball game.y’all always complaining like some b#tches. It’s y’all money don’t buy the game if it’s trash for you.P
yOu CaNt KeEp AdDiNg OlD sTuFf YoU gOtTa TrY sOmEtHiNg NeW....... 2k continues to give us same parks, cities, etc. ohhh not to mention same freaking clothes where's the new stuff agent hmmmmm????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯
Theyre finally starting to realize
2k22 didnt even released dude :/
WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT NBA2K22 LOOK EXACTLY LIKE NBA2K21 ..?
yet we say 2k is trash every year but we always pre order it
Stopped at 2k20. Dookie game dookie company
Every year y’all think y’all going to get a new game“🤡”
“Dry game” because we’re not all rich and got a PS5 fam 😂
NBA 2k22 will be current gen on pc?
They really need to flesh out my career. Individual warm-ups, signing autographs, post-game press access, my behind-the-scenes locker room pre and post-game. I missed all the post-game interviews that dropped off in 2k21, i felt like once you got to the NBA, it lost its appeal.
Please allow us to play better defense 🤦🏾‍♂️
You sound sick bro
UR FORGETTING IT WAS 30 BUCKS OR LESS ON XBOX ONE LITERALLY ALL THE TIME. (Its also on game pass)
Just take away speed boosting ..... stopping on a dime then 40mph the opposite way unguardable
Still gonna buy it
WHY DOES NBA 2K22... LOOK EXACTLY LIKE NBA 2K14*
so uhh us redditors have the power now since luka is the cover athlete right agent?
Copy and Paste, with a few changes bru🤷🏾‍♂️
they are dropping them on the same day
No no it’s not you don’t know that it might be changing on that because Luke dockage he is going to change my career on NBA 2K 22 you don’t know that
YA’LL FINALLY NOTICED THANK GOD
Agent what if the made 21 trash on prepose so they can work on 22 and make it better it’s just a theory
Finally people are realizing that it is the same game every year. Fanboys of the series have to realize that at one point ea will just make the next one the same thing without any changes. I played madden 17 and 18 and saw no differences. I seen people play nba 20 and 21 with no differences. If you want your game to change stop buying it and show ea what you really want.
2K is the type of people to add a a cross play dlc for 40 dollars
I’ll catch it on sale for $3+ again
I feel like Power Forwards are gonna be OP like 2k21 next gen, btw I don't have a next gen console. But I do hear alot of 2k news
i like agents sick voice😫😫😫no homo
I don’t understand why people still have hope in this game.
Anyone else experiencing delay in shot meter in park but not in my career or just me?
Here we go again 2k..... 😒😒😒
Stop buying 2k and watch how fast money talks to them about making real improvements. The community is part of the problem why the game is shit now and yes you content creators sell out every year this game come out.
.......Dude... Duh....
BACK IN HIS ELEMENT!!!
I just want the old jump shot meter
I just want to hop in Pro Am and immediately get a game 🥲
I really don’t understand y it matters if they look the same don’t buy the game y’all wanna complain but gone buy the game keep playing 2k21 then I’ll bet they’ll do something if u gone buy the game stop crying
I just wanna be able to make threes in mycareer. That's it. And yes I'm trash but after shooting 1-12 you think my 3 level scorer would get lucky at least. I get "slightly late" or "slightly early" 9 of 10 timed. Makes me sad.
This man still crying bout 2k
Game going to be the same lbs
Setting screens in 2k21 was trash and the defense suck
Bruh when i play online NBA 2k21 on My Series X My Xbox just turn off i don't if it is that series gots hot or something i don't know
People still play 2k… yikes
Because it’s the same exact game lol
2k19 was one of the best 2ks every made
im building my youtube i have no time for 2k and gaming right now i spent too much time on that shit. i wanna meet agent 00 in the future and it aint gon happen playing 2k all day
2K really needs to ditch last gen and rebuild the game 😂
They need to do the players introduction on the game
Only reason I buy 2k is to make on online my league with my homeboy and we create my players to grind up
Just finna wait until Epic gives it away for free.
The city was the most  dumbest shit in a basketball game 🤣🤣🤣
2k hasnt been great since 2k11. & I disagree with your comment about us living in the past. If 2k is gonna keep making the same game every year, then let me live in a time where the game had better shit. Like affiliations.
Yall ready for these greatest of all time badges😉
THEY WERE DEFINITELY COUNTING THE ONES WHO PURCHASED THE LEGEND EDITION OF 21 AND GOT NEXT GEN FREE!!!!! I BET HALF GOT NEXT GEN FREE… FACTOR THAT IN MAIN MAN!
Who cares about the cover- you don’t play a cover - you play a game.
My god, 2k fans are finally breaking out of the simulation
I’m not going to be a negative Nancy before ever even playing the game. No they haven’t been 2k11 or 2k16 but I still enjoy the game. I feel like y’all complain just because that’s what’s cool to do.   I will admit however, I wish 2k would just release a long term game and constantly update it (circa GTA 5) instead of constantly releasing a new one.
Y'all might as well give up maaaannn 😂😂😂😂😂
Cause 2k is a wackass game since same animations same célébration same story    player be lookin like what are we doing here loosin mind and ps you cant make a great game a in less then a year they not takin enough time to make a game
maybe its time 2k makes one game with seasonally updates for online and just makes seasons a battle pass
They don’t care about they game lmfao they left 2K21 unfixed
All yall 2k player please don’t come to live we don’t want you🤷🏾‍♀️
What the hell is with your camera focus? Every time there's a cut, there's a focus fade-in. It's annoying. Stop that.
https://youtu.be/DcLGhiCtuRw NBA2k22 Space jam
https://youtu.be/DcLGhiCtuRw NBA2k22 Space jam
Sports game fans are finally entering the stone age I see.
i’m so done bro for years they don’t listen to us but it’s money over our enjoyment but it’s cuz you bozos buy it year after year they don’t need to listen to us if they still got sales up. they need to hire agent ong
Y’all are finally starting to realize.
it’s gunna be the same shi don’t pre order
yesssirrrrrr
As long as it doesn’t crash every 30min I’m cool with it
oh NOW y'all notice
I hate that 2k does the copy and paste i literally buy it for the updated rosters i tried to give nba live a chance but I’m so used to the 2k gameplay that I just couldn’t do it I just hope we don’t get 5+ years on the next gen of just a little roster update no new legend teams and a little more sweat to the players
It goin to be the same wack shit in the game wit no effect put in it
🔵🔵
Guess what, you've been had.  It's been the same game for the last 5 years, with minimal differences.
They make it look good every year just like the city..  👎🏾
Still buying 2k22
Am I the only one who likes 2k here lmao
Naa it needed to be even more realistic if it turns into nba jam I’m done !!
What if, and hear me out on this, they re brand the game next year? Go for a "live service" type of game, rename it just NBA2K and then just keep developing it going forward?
Wait... releasedate is September 10... one day before September 11... 9/11... Really? One day before the 10 year anniversary? Foreshadowing?
The reason cross play for my team is going to exist, is that its not that hard to move a xml file from one console to the next. Besides, it´s not like my team or GM mode is going to be any different then 2k19... it never is!
yall should kick kai out for a prank
They know the game is trash, so they are not putting out a demo so they can cash in that pre order money! NBA 2k22 is going to be the same game as NBA 2k21, only this time PC will get the same version and not the trash one. Game is still going to be 2k21 trash, just nice looking trash.
Bring defense back
Those might be cap because the game is free on Pc and xbxox
I’m def not buying
2k21 was just like 2k20, and here we go again
2K19 WAS GOOD????????????? SHIT WAS ASS IN MY OPINION
NBA 2K22 NEEDS THE SAME GRAPHICS FROM NEXT GEN BUT THE SPEED AND ANIMATION AND DRIBBLING FROM CURRENT GEN LIKE GET IT TOGETHER ROONIE...WE NEED PARK LIKE NEXT GEN AND NEW GRAPHICS AND COLLEGE STORY
Bout time y'all start using your brains
Same game every year but still won’t fix their bugs 🤦🤦🤦
just want  the old meters bro wtf
All you clowns just gonna buy it and vc for the another year straight because y’all are bots. There just gonna keep selling the same shit because they’ll never learn.
I shit talk to 2k and trash they games but I love playing myteam this relationship is toxic
Everybody know dirk was a unicorn fr he just ain’t have people
Still no cross play wtf🤦🏾
I really hope there’s a demo cuz that’s gonna determine if I get the game or not
2k community has nothing to complain about ; we could be the madden community  ; we should be grateful
I LOVE U AGENT
They’re finally starting to realize
If I join modded parks I stg I’m beating ronnies ass
Ok Din muktar boy spitten
that boy din muktar spittin fact yeo😭
Don’t even know why you still have to buy the game, surely it can be free to play updated service with all the money they make from micro transactions already
I stopped playing 2k21 4 months in sad...park ain’t been good in some years
Shid 2k gonna need a whole new engine but that’s gonna cost money so they gon copy/paste til they can’t no more that’s why it’s BORING
so you niggas are finally realising that NOTHING changes
Just wait till black friday it will be cheaper
You would think with next gen console they would at least try and make a new park
Guys! If you want a better basketball game in regards of gameplay, then DON'T BUY THE GAME!!! If you can't go 6months to a year without playing a 2k basketball game then you really don't have much to do in your life. This is how you attack their wallets! They hear how bad their game is but they know you guys are going to buy anyway regardless of complaints. Either move onto a different game for the year or go out and focus on making yourself better. Go stack your 💰!   Its no secret. Stop buying the product and make them create the game YOU want. I'm a guy that believes nba 2k11 is still the best 2k basketball game while nba 2k16 was the last 'okay' basketball game. So I'm an old head that has experience great gameplay to down right shameful gameplay as 2k progressed.
Cause the only people still playing aren’t smart enough to notice
Why won’t people give up on this game? Literally dog shit now
2K18: Trash 2K19: Good 2K (after push and other patches late in the year) and it could have been so much better had they not gave up on it 2 months in  2K20: Trash game that they gave up on after a few months. 2K21: Absolute garbage   So how about y’all idiots don’t give them 70-110 dollars again this year yeah?
Gift of gab. I learned nothing but was still entertained lol
"Ronnie 2k on his bull-shit again.." 😒
FUCK
I hope they understand if this isn’t as good as 17/16 it’s over
Anyone anywhere can be the cover star. I’m guessing when you preorder you put yourself on the cover (I wish) OR in game you use your my player as the back ground cover
Idek y I even clicked it’s the same shit every year
He said it’s not a demo because we already playing the demo 2K21
No such thing as a make or break year… until 2k has competition 👀 LIVE ?
So if I buy the 75th legend I’ll get it on my regular Xbox and I’ll be able to download next gen when I get my new one?
Finally, you see the truth.
Sadly not buying 2k this year
humanity is progressing. ppl are starting to realize the sports games are literally just recycling material, selling you the same product. but asking more money for it each year.
So yall are finally realizing this? Lmfao
Y'all niggas slow af lmao. You guys have been in a genjutsu for basically an entire decade.  I'm shocked it's taken people this long to realize they've been buying the same game every year.
Are y’all actually only now realizing the games are just copy and pastes?
Probably the same reason 2k21 look like 2k20.  It’s over for 2k.  At this point they gon have to team up with rockstar games for me to buy it again.  I’ll just wait til it his gamepass 🤣
No one cares about the WNBA 😂
Y’all idiots still buying the same game over and over 🤣
Damn you lost hella weight. Shirt don’t fit anymore lol.
i’m 1000% buying the wnba edition.
See naw I’m not buying that junt smh
What you said about us spending money on the game on players and $70 dollars and all that.. I felt that . Come on if we gone spend money at least try harder to make it fun
~Predicting the future~  2k22 no demo People still pre-order and buy it Complain its trash  broken at launch Ppl still buy vc  Waste more vc because they patch your player so you have to build another one.  If you buy 2k22 before these YT show you how good it is then your a fool and will forever been done bareback raw by 2k and you like it.
2k fans have become sentient finally
Until you sheep stop buying the game this is just gonna keep happening lmao
So the gamers finally realise it's just the fucking same
Aint nobody buying the wnba cover unless u a girl🤣
The white shawty from the AMP Love and Basketball wants you man I seen her TikToks
Every year even if you go back all YouTubers are repeating the same thing 😅😅
Boring they don’t care at this point and we will be playing the same game over and over the city is unrealistic and if I see another fucking bike
Com on bro do your research it’s up for preorder both gens
nba community is finally realizing that the games are all the same
If you buy 2k22, you are a slave
I'll just do the same thing I did for 2K21. Wait until its around 65% off to buy it or free to play. 2K doesn't deserve $60 for half a**ed content
Can't wait for 2k23 Played 10-20. Didn't get 19 Didn't get 21  Not getting 22
8:07 DANGGGGGG 📠📠📠📠📠📠📠📠📠📠📠
7:51 yea📠
Because it is. Lol why put out a new game when you guys will keep buying this trash lol.
People stay complaining. I’m playing 2k22 while you play 2k21 😂😎
It's a waste of money to buy the same game as last year. Just because it's a new season. If we boycott them, then they'll have to make an actual new game. Not jus rename last year's version and give it a new name
LMFOAOAOAOOA
2k gets y’all every fucking year 😂 21 next gen was so bad , that they shoulda paid us for that BS….now it’s a new year. And y’all ready to buy again hahahaha
I haven’t played 2K since 2K16. I stopped playing after observing no changes. Not surprising. People are gonna STILL eat it up. So it doesn’t matter lol.
I aint buying until a a couple months in, not wasting my money on a garbage game fuck em
Until you all stop buying this shit, it will never improve. 2k has no reason to improve.
Thanks man, I'm not buying this either
Doesn't matter how bad it is...You'll all buy it anyways, just like you do every year  3 things to life.... Death, Taxes, and Terrible consumers lol  Just remember, every dollar you give Tencent is another dollar towards Chinese concentration camps and human atrocities!!  Enjoy you soulless cretins!!
Luka boutta get traded
I don’t buy 2k until it’s $4. That price is worth an updated roster….
I could sit and play 2k17 forever n not get bored wyo Lmso
2k is NOT owned by a Chinese company. 2k is owned by Take-two, a publicly traded US company.
Ion have no hope for 2k 22. They making next gen and current gen. They could barley even make jus 1 good. Wat makes u think they gon make both gen games good 💀.
Bring back fight night EA
The only reason I’m getting 2K22 is for the Candace Parker Cover
Worst 2k ever...I usually grind it but can't do it this year 😪
All these sports games are literally the same year after year, haven't changed in like 15 years, and people still shovel ea money
Since I bought 2k for the PS 4/5 and just had a five for 2 weeks was hoping they didn’t put one out and waited for next season. To perfect that bihhb for the new generation. 1st time in yearssss I won’t be pre ordering smh disappointed
The mechanics and movement in next gen 21 was assssssss. For this reason I won’t be purchasing another game till I pick it up cheap like I did 2k20.
Bro wtf do y’all want the 2k company to do bro, the grafics dident have to change jus da GAME play bro wtf
Agent is just a 2k clickbait guy
So many great games out there yet millions of people play hoopy shooty game on their TV screen lol come on
THESE IDIOTS ARE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND, FINALLY
(NBA 2K22 FORTNITE edition) More Green 3s✅ More Over the Top on the  Team Dunks🏀 More lag More Cash More Trash LET’S GOOOOOO!!!!!!!
The simulation is breaking...
It took ya this long to notice 🤣🤣🤣
II don't see why both gens would come out on 2 different days.
2k sucks.
Hi, are you a moron? I figured this shit out 14 years ago.
Because 2k  games are cheap as hell.
Does anyone know the definition of insanity by chance?
Y’all spent 70.?!???😭😭
There hasnt been no gameplay idk why yo dumbass would even make this vid
The next gen version better not release a month later.
Not buying 2k anymore. It’s been trash for like 4 years
They might as well just turn this into an update lol
good vid
Fuck 2k stop buying it since 19
Japanese. I'm coppn now🤦🏿‍♂️
I think A’ja Wilson shouldve been on the WNBA cover
I thought 20 was pretty good
Every sports game is just the same game as 4 years ago they just took out some shit
Nba2k is dead now lil kids taking over .. toxic community and same game plays as always !!
Just don’t buy it!!!
Stick to the title bro Click bait
Before 2k releases.. we hate it After the first patch.. ITS WHAT WE WANTED  Towards the end.. we hate it.. again  2k is probably so confused with this community but at the same time it’s like they’ve capped out on this game.. what else can they do?
I just 2k21 I think for free off epic games store…
This doodoo azz series has been the same since 2k15 game is straight doodoo balls
good lord, f these money pit games. i don't understand why consumers keep throwing their money at these. super depressing as an old school gamer to see where we're at. games and tech haven't advanced much in the past 10 years yet prices have tripled. f that.
I am not buying 2k22
Next gen sucks
It looks the same because they figured out people are suckeres and they are easy to get money out of just by releasing a game that isn't any better than the last.
I know , apparently 9 billion people are stringing beans . Wtf are yes editing Registration , we  looking at?  British weights are in secret glass compartments ! Even NASA doesn't reply
My opinion abt 2k to me 2k19 the best had dribble moves lets be honest here leave a comment
Agent zero always crying make s game brah
I RATHER PLAY MLB THE SHOW!! SOOOOOO TIRED OF THESE REMAKES!
Why are people still buying this game? I don't understand...  It's LITERALLY pay to win.
Y’all still buy 2k?😂😂😂
Scam
The more realistic the better. The more cheese the worse. The game should punish bad basketball choices and reward good basketball choices. If you only know how to call for the ball and then iso take a 3 or drive baseline your game is trash. Learn to set offball picks. Learn to run offball screens. Learn correct fast break lanes. Learn spacing. Learn over under picks. Learn how to box out. I hate this mentality of pick up the game and let me try scoring 40 while taking dumb shots. Basketball is a beautiful sport. Punish the bad. Reward people who learn. Teach basketball.
I haven't bought the game going on 3yrs now. I feel good not to get hooked on buying the next same copy and paste game ✌🏾 bye you 2k crackheads
New things new 2k stop bringing 2k21 up trash ass game
Tbh if you could fight in 2k after someone dunks on you or pushes you it would be fun
NBA LIVE 22 🙏
I've said to myself over and over that 2k22 will be trash and a waste of money and yet after reading what you get with some pre orders im back in the loop of debating on maybe buying the game
Whats their to improve nba 2k, its just a ball game just needs to fix the graphic and servers xD
I can’t wait to not buy 2k22
Lmao the title had me wondering what tf yall were hoping for💀
I’m glad there isn’t no demo 🤷🏾‍♂️
just dont buy the game
2k servers have and always will be 🐕 💩 but 21 was such a horrible fuckn disaster I think imma stay away from 22 for a min and wait to see all the glitches cheese builds and exploits
Nigga nobody has screen shots of the game yet stop with this weak ass click baiting shit
I wont have 2k22 im taking this year off
Hi
Bro nba 2k has looked the same since 2k for the ps3/360 era where you been at?
Bro just cover another game 2k not for you
2k:  *we'll make 2022 a great experience!!!" when game drops: *2k adds some extra sweat*
2k22 drops on my Birthday sep 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AYEEEEEEEEEE
If 2k22 comes out trash I’ll just jump back to 2k20 😂
Probably why Madden 18 to 22 looks the same :) No competition & people keep buying the crap & spending BILLIONS on My Team, my player & The Park. Funny how Madden & NBA 2K are similar in ways, but way different in ways too. Cross play, each platforms communities want it but the game devs & console makers just seem not to to care about that aspect
It’s amazing how much money we spend on 2k but they can’t make it feel like a new game is bs
It’s the same thing
I haven’t bought this game for almost 6 years now because I’m not stupid thinking it’s going to change for the better it’s like buying madden hoping for something better and madden ain’t been shit for about 10 years
LOL WNBA celebrating 25 years. 25 years of what, only existing because of the charity of the NBA for 25 years.
2K has learned well from EA. There is no need to design a good game because the low IQ player base will keep buying the same game with a roster update OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Why bother putting the time and resources required to make a great game?
Nobody cares about covers we want a solid game is that going to happen probably not lol
Same for Fifa
Why do all the "content creators"........do nothing but clickbait??
The hype for another 2K is at an all time low and nobody gives a fuck
2k is trash, I only buy it when it's on sale halfway thru next year. People who spend $100 are just suckers 🤷🏽‍♂️
I love how the title implies that this hasnt been happening over and over for 6-7 years
Why have you been making this exact same video... FOR A DECADE NOW  Maybe it just sucks dude smh stop ALWAYS playing it tweaker if something sucks why do you keep going back to it? Dude its no joke been SEVEN years it's time to move on
2k is making is trying to make it more realistic...... Cuz Curry sliding behind screens that suck you in is completly realistic.
It’s the onli basketball game we r f$@&;/
Agent needs to stop making 2k videos, I enjoy him hanging around amp the most all these 2k21 videos were so boring and all the amp videos are bangers
Intro look like madden
The way to make 2K truly fun is to find a balance between what the game was in between 2K15-2K17 and what the game is today. Implementing actual archetypes into the game was a great idea. But now the problem with archetypes is that they’re way too specific and limit players to one to two skills maximum. And because of that we have reached a place where a few build types are overpowered and everyone uses them, and everyone else who’s using the other builds totally regrets making them (even though they made the build in confidence that it was the kind of player they wanted) because they get creampied every time they step on the court.
EA save us😭
Whattup agent! Looking healthy brother! Endure!
Y’all dumb af for buying this shit every year
The real question is why every year ya'll say the same damn thing bout 2k yet you still continue to play it?  Stop complaining and then spend 100s if not 1000s of dollars on it stoooopid.  Good for views though huh
I don't play 2K or COD. Mediocre games at best. I give it to you guys who buy Madden and 2k every year though..
Video games series are a scam
I’ve been fucking stop playing 2k
They did cross play when doing a 5v5 pro am tournament during nba 2k17
Everyone just needs to give up and stop buying their crap game
i play 2k on pc and this year they only had current gen on steam do you thinkor know if they will have next gen on pc this year???
Because every 2k after 2k17 were all the same
You acting surprised, it’s been the same game for years
Looking for news? It’s been the same ass damn game for 5 years..
2k and nba need to combine and male the beat basketball game ever we needa get 2k moves but nba live clothes and courts and this would be littty  👇🏾
They still don’t have the new gens in stores
If the gameplay/animations isn’t better I think nobody could give 2 sh*ts about it honestly. 2k literally caters to MyTeam & 2k YouTubers. I’ll buy  just cause it’s my most playable game yet if it’s 2k21 copy/paste won’t spend time on it as much as Madden, COD, & Apex (hopefully they make a NG version) & HOPE somebody makes a boxing game. In fact I’ll also HOPE somebody can compete with 2k so they can get their game together for REAL BASKETBALL GAMERS, not the city in which we don’t care about. Focus on making a game that in detail simulates real life basketball. And leave the meta builds out! That broken PF position IS STUPID🗣
I forgot NBA2k22 was coming out 😂
70 price hike but 8 million sold but y’all hate the game? Man somebody 🧢
Definitely make or break I can’t take it no more imma rec player
Can we pls get cross play I wish they would listen to this this would change the game completely
I remember you showing what might be a new verse of 22. How bout that private park where only your friends list could be invited or come in and anyone else that's not there friends or on their friends list have to have permission have to have an invite.  I have friends playing daily and we compete just about everyday on 21. That would be what I deem an addictive bonus. Just a thought.  Overall I'll wait until I see the game in action and the response from other players if I'm gonna by it off the bat or just wait until......
It looks the same because all NBA games are the same. All sports games are the same every year, like why buy the new one, like I refuse to believe people go "OMG THE RESOLUTION OF THE SWEAT ON HIS FORHEAD IS 4K NOW?!"
It's already 3 bucks at GameStop.
i haven't played 2k since 2k20 first came out..... I've played 2k religiously since 2k16. I'm gonna be so mad if 2k22 is ass
Next gen 2k21 had too many bugs. MyNBA was unplayable hoping 22 is fixed and just better overall
Definitely not buying on release, solid vid as per use tho.
People actually expect sport games to look different every single year…SMH
Has anyone ever informed you about the definition of insanity?
If tencent owns it, then good luck contacting the CCP😂
Y’all just gonna buy the damn game anyway and complain all over again… We have to stop supporting.
Here starts the cycle of complaining about the game just for you to buy it again agent. At least you’re not alone. Everyone else is a sheep like you
Blah blah blah
No demo means they are expecting people to blindly buy it knowing good and well it’s probably gonna be the same game
Why does why do what why does 🥴
Because its literally the same just with a 22 at the end.
Charli D’Amelio NEEDS TO BE CANCELED FOR THIS!! #CANCELLED   LINK: https://youtu.be/8sra3zq1Zq0
It's not a make or break year, you just said "they had a record year" lol if you're tired of the game being bad each year, don't buy the game or buy it used. Don't give Tencent your money and then they'll make changes.
All these ppl bitching about the game being almost the same as the year before...yet I havent seen one of you make a game thats better...oh wait you can't so stfu
Did the sport of Basketball radically change between 2021 and 2022? Did they add rocket boots after raising the height of the hoops a million miles or something? No, I'm pretty sure that didn't happen. It's still the same game. You know way back when, game systems usually only had a single game dedicated to each sport. Because why would you make the same game twice? You buy one basketball game, you don't need to buy it again. I mean, it's about playing the game right? We aren't obsessing over any individual players in the game that we wanna see depicted on our PlayBoxes and X-stations, right? Oh, nevermind I guess.  Wait a minute, it's not even 2022 yet. How even...?
Because you fools keep paying
ionly keep getting new 2k's because all my other friends have it, and bc they shut down servers after a certain time
I wonder if the copies sold went up when 2k was on sale earlier in the year??
Because the games ARE the same every year, try playing a real videogame like an RPG or a shooter you casual.
It needs to be a demo the gameplay might look good but I want to feel it for myself
The bar is so low now, and I can tell your hopes are at an all time low Agent lmao
I’ll never buy another 2k game until they fire the whole team and revamp it.
2k has always been simulation. Live is arcade.    These youtubers are gonna ruin 2k22
The Seventy Firth anniversary
2k21 was the first 2k I’ve skipped since 2k09 and I must say that I don’t really miss it that much. Year after year of disappointment w/ that game along w/ the constant politicization of the sport has kinda killed my love for it all.
make a video playing nba live 19 , the game is so bad that it’s fun btw i recommend making the vinsanity build
No one buy 2k22 and 23 will be good
I’m say it every year nba 2k should be more of an online service game and they should only release a new IP every 5 or so years when technology requires it.  The type of changes they make can all be done via updates.
It’s the same thing every year like dang switch it up like mycareer is the same every year myteam is the same every year I don’t really care for myleague as much as myteam and mycareer. But with mycareer it’s the same thing every year with the same plot like it’s mycareer I should be able to control the plot since it’s mycareer
Maybe not buy a game that was in development during a Pandemic
They should make the game more realistic because someone doing the curry slide behind a screen and score is wack they should disable the screen button during park mode
Ea sports for you not bothered about anybody else besides themselves and their micro transactions
Did you just click bait 🤨😭😭
been a make or break year, since 2k16. except all the content creators hang on by a limb, hoping 2k will change, after buying the game and VC, every single year, it starts with a trend to not buy the game, and lead by example.   not realizing 2k is now the basketball call of duty game since 2k17, is beyond me.   So sad the nba only lets them and Ea do anything.   I get my fun from single player tho, so im not tripping, but the days of old are gone, now boycott with you wallet, and let them know, you wont support them until changes happen. lead by example.  also, noice job on losing weight, Chin and neck looking ripped.
Bruh I can't believe people still play that dogshit game
You gonna buy it anyway…. So stop watching the video, just accept it 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
2k22 look like 2k21 look like 2k20 look like 2k19 look like....
I don't like people that play sports games.
FIFA 22>>>>>
Cant wait for NCAA so we can leave 2k in the past
Cuz it’s the only basketball game out , NCAA goin kill them in sales when it comes beck
The problem with 2k Next Gen is the massive, massive grind to get your badges etc. The game is just anti fun. Can't play the game online cause you haven't got badges yet, play offline, badges grind far too slow, bored, bored, quit. That was my experience with 2k MyCareer this year. They need to remove badges and make it all stats. Having 2 things to grind is just boring.
This game suck on purpose
Everybody is overthinking it. Just bring authentic parks and gyms to the game. Your Myplayer can start off by making a name for themselves in high school. Then decide to play at famous parks and gyms like Rucker Park, Venice Beach, MacGregor Park, Dyckman Park, the Drew League or GLeague on their way to the NBA. We can go even further if you want to go world wide, and add Pigalle Court, City Wall Rooftop Court or The Tenement. The options are endless. You know 2K loves micro-transactions lol so it can be a DLC or season pass to get exclusive parks. They can use the region like East, South or West Coast to determine the scenery of the Bball courts; to have a variety. With the main court being a popular Bball court from that area. To cut the wait time down for competition games. They can make it like the ProAm or Rec, where you just load into a game. I have more ideas and I would go into gameplay but…I would just love to see it get back to what the game is about, Basketball!!! The extra stuff is cool with the skateboard and the city, but it’s nothing like authenticity. They may have to pay a few people for likeness but micro-transactions will definitely cover it, then some.
T shirt is 🔥🔥🔥!!! 💯💯💯 btw.
Team USA/International teams n tourney w/ Olympics in MyCareer??!!!???!!!
The problem is there's nothing else new to integrate into the game when you make a games every year ideas get dry, my problem is when they close survers of old 2ks that I stil like playing to force me to play the new one.
This idea came from a comment on agents 2k22 cover competitions video but it said that all these modders and artists should get together and make their own company and gane. I swear on my dead pet crayfish I would buy your game even if it costs more than 2k. I would even buy stocks in the company to help. Please do this because i am getting tired of 2k
Just make it a subscription service and update rosters appropriately at this point, sports games dont need a yearly "new" game imo.
y’all niggas really complain about everything, like y’all must be doing something wrong if you ain’t the ones creating the game 😂😂
they got like a pattern so i’m expecting a new build system in the game
I hope 2k don’t add these stupid invincible cards that shit is broken
Why does this dude have this many subs....
2k sucks now
The difference between 2K and every other game is the Skill Gap, COD is divided by skill - 2K has no skill gap, players get gassed by bs animations and “sweats” are just toxic players exploiting every cheesy animation
Anyone else still playing 2k20 ?
I didn't think it was going to be a lecture
Repent Jesus is coming
I’ve given up. Too many years of under execution. Idc how good it is honestly and I love basketball so it hurts but I’m done w this bs
I have high expectations for 2k22 cause 2k21 was made during COVID so now 2k should have less COVID restrictions when creating their game
Is 2k22 park gonna be the same game on PS4 and ps5. like has 2k confirmed this if so can you send me a link to the source because I don’t like opinionated answers I want the confirmation from 2k themselves.
No no no no no no no omfg rony fack
Oh shit I haven’t seen his videos in a year. This man looking skinny 👀
Told yall it wasn't gonna be better. 2k doesn't try at this point. Like I said I'm staying on 2k21 😂 I aint buying that 2k22, the cover is lit Though ill give you that much but 2k rushes things too much man. Watch 2k23 Come out in damn 5 to 6 months
Bruh at some point yall YouTubes gotta face reality. Current Gen is/was just straight garbage. Only reason it gets more views is for 2 reasons and 2 reasons only, majority couldn't get the next Gen console so yall bash it thats just facts and the #1 reason is that bs Chronus Zen. 2k changed the shot timing in every spot on the court in Next Gen making the Zen useless Current gen is wide open and they still haven't found a way to patch it. Comp play on Next gen all the trash kids who can't shoot without a Zen cry and stay on last gen.
Make sure you buy the disc so you can take it back to the store 😂
Knowing a bit about networking and servers, it's legit lazy of companies to not include cross play. A hardlink to bridge servers and a command line optimization after a week of testing.
what pisses me off is that i payed almost 500 for my next gen console because i play pro am and was hyped for next gen and it didn’t even work for series s. Now we are getting close to nba 2k22 and it’s looking bad, 2k promoted next gen like there was no tomorrow just to cater to current gen
2k banking off years and years of empty promises lmao I’ll pass
Playstation 4 users, just wait till the games goes on sale for 5 bucks, they do it every year. Unless you’re grinding for legend or playing my team then go for it, but the game isn’t worth all your money if you’re casual
I’ve play every 2k but 2k21 was my first time playing park. It sucked lol. Ig imma go back to playing cod. Or better yet I hope gta v enhanced version is worth it. Also it got forza horizon 5 so forget trashy 2k😂
And y'all are still going to buy it. So literally all of these videos are pointless.
I MIGHT hop on the 2k trend ngl
I got it pre order
Wear a Compton hat, wear black shades, and only then, will i like every video i see
I didn’t buy 2k21 and it’s looking like I ain’t buying 22 😂
Still won’t be buying
agent go peep your ig dms i texted you pls notice
We all knew this was gonna happen
We need 2K to be good enough to bring Gman back🙏🏽
There's just no way to put out an actually new game every year unless you're okay with pure trash. So you should be a smart consumer and only buy one of these sports titles every few years when it's actually a new game or when you get sick of old rosters. They've been doing this for 20 years now, anyone complaining have only played themselves.
They just gotta stop releasing a new NBA Game every year, and change the title to something else IDK...
I'm done with 2K. Just can't justify dropping 70 then 50 for a player. Then deal with the park, and everyone having the same EXACT build
This is a make it or break it
Boycott 2k , they are scamming a lot of people
I’m retired from 2k , I’m playing nba live
They literally have a song that trolls all of us in 21…”same game it just a look a little different but it still won’t make a difference noo…back like we never left” lmfaoo tell me y’all don’t listen to that song and shake your head??? !!
At this point it isn't 2K's fault anymore, it's the people who keep buying the game
They should’ve put LeBron James on the cover
since 2k15 aww man its been that long lol its been a good ride pause day1 gang
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Damn I ain't even buy 21
I don't even play 2k but your video format is so easy to digest. Not sure why YT recommended this but good video!
2k17 was the last FUN 2K. This 💩 they’ve been pushing out is trash ass
2k community inna abusive relationship wit the devs 🤡 💀 couldnt be me tho
I will never play 2K again loool they are so far gone from a good mechanically functioning game. It caters to BUMS
People will buy the game regardless because the stupid most excuse ever, 2k is the only company that make good simulation basketball game. Well not anymore if they keep being lazy with copy and paste gameplay and with paid to win micro transactions, the cycle keep going over and over.
Fed 09 was my birthday
people who complain keep buying the games. stop buying these games.
I still dont understand why they wouldnt do cross platform. Yes, it cost them money to set up servers to allow them to enable cross platform, but in the end i think it does make them more money. I only recently got back into the game because they made 2k21 current gen free on the epic store for pc, and at first it seemed like the game was popping. But after a week parks were essentially empty, probably because the pc community is very small, making it hard as hell to get any rep. All my earned vc was going towards upgrading my OVR and i never got any drip. But if I could have actually found games maybe they could have gotten me to buy vc and drip my dude out
Can we actually come together as a community & all agree to not buy the game & boycott it so they finally have to try now
My money is going to ea with that sexy battlefield bro 2k is done bruh there is ZERO HOPE 😪 as a hopper I hate that it’s dying too bc it’s like the only basketball game and I just be trying to play a basketball game smh imma just get the old 2k and grind offline honestly 🤒🤕👿
I hate ur hairless face, I hate your sloppy t-shirt neck, I hate the way you wear your hat…I’m out!✌🏾.
So the gamers finally realise it's just the fucking same
Will the PC version be “Next Gen”?
i wish other developers with make a good streetball game that isnt cheesy like street.
Until people stop spending money on 2k. 2k WILL ALWAYS BE TRASH cause 2k ain’t gone fix it cause they don’t need to CAUSE THEY KNOW NO MATTER WHAT THEY WILL NEVER FIX IT
It's kind of cringe people actually care so much about who's on the cover
Who the Fck still buys these games? Stop buying them you weirdos , all y'all do it complain every ear and then every year it sells better than the year before 🦽🦽
Y’all talk bad on 2k but still buy it 😭
No one cares about wnba
Agent obviously u ain’t learn shit in the last semlem years lol
Lmao 2k again, just DOES NOT give a fuck about their pc port. They know damn well if they add cross play WHICH THEY SHOULD. they know they would actually have to police the PC Version better. Mannnnnnn fuck 2k
I dont even play sports games, but yall really been complaining about this shit for years.... and yet you still buy the next game.
Those GameStop ps5 bundles not foolin anybody for the 2k game sales
I haven’t even gave 2k22 a thought, that’s how low my standards are.
I haven’t touched 2k21 since last November
Luka getting a cover of Giannis is white privilege...he doesn't even have a MVP.  Fuck outta here
why does nba 2k22 look like nba 2k15 there fixed your title
Click bait
Ngl all i wanted was next gen 2k21 when it came out hopefully current gen has the city and new hairs
Just dont buy it man please ffs
People are still gonna buy it and complain 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Niggas just gonna buy the game regardless, not me tho, yall be cool
2k is trying to find a way to charge your internet provider before they drop cross-platform play -- smh
Give me that 2k16 gameplay back, with 2k11 Crew, and 2k10 my player. I’m not looking for a story in Mycareer. Let me play the Draft Combine tho, that was nice.
We know this game gonna be trash, give us our own attributes with caps like 2k16
Agent couldn't be more off. What's fun for one person is not fun for another.  To me, more realistic is more fun. This game couldn't be further from realistic if they tried.
So what they thinking wit kareem dirk n kd. Am i missing sum?
At this point we just need to stop buying the game
Lols people still talk trash about that game and people are still gonna buy it so why complain you're still gonna buy it 😆😆
Rest up
People are just now noticing? Lol bruh
Rinse & Repeat that's what 2K is same game over and over.
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved..
I don't know why it's such a surprise about this game I stopped playing 2K 3 years ago it's the same game every year and it's always a shock to you agent why how much money 2K is putting in your pocket because honestly you may just need to start another game content because every time I see your feed it's the same thing how can we make 2K better no how can we make your content better cuz 2K is not doing it my guy
Cant wait to play nba 2k21 soon
cross-play?????
I haven’t played since nba 2k16
Don’t care I just know everyone getting the game Everyone 🧢 if they say they ain’t getting it
this video is still trending
Sports fans are the biggest fuckin bozos, buying the same game over and over and then gambling within them, only for it to reset next year
Every 60 seconds in Africa a minute passes.
NHL series: “First time?”
All you youtubers are the problem yall make them stupid money but never stop playing the bum ass game
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
You got that rona?
I can answer this question,.Ahem-.because 2K is a game that is yearly released for stupid casuals like the ones making this video. It will NOT EVER change because people like Agent 00,.85% of the mouth breathing people in this comments sectiom,.STG, People like this will always buy the game not matter the price and spend real money on the lottery that is known as Virtual Currency. So, what is the actual reason we are asking ourselves why does it look and play the same with little to no improvements on features? Because they don't  have too that's why, you're gonna buy it anyway so what's the difference?
Bro what camera and lens are you using?  Your auto focus issues are either caused by the resolution you are recording at or the lens/adapter you are using.
21 on trending 🤩
HOPEFULLY THEY FIX THE LOADING SCREEN 🌕🤣
Because of Capitalism. All the things you hate about video games are because of Capitalism.
I want it so bad
they dont care and this point just doing it for the money after 2k19 i told my self ill never buy another 2k game again. Pay to play ruins games what happened to actually grinding players. also mechanics are so bad too. NBA LIVE 05 is goated and there will never be another like it
have anyone pre ordered already?
2k won’t change until another company comes out with a better basketball game. Until then 2k will just copy the same homework for years on end.
2k21 feels like a fever dream, i literally dont even remember it and it barely came out under a year ago
I think I may have retired from My Career for now. I've been having alot more fun playing My NBA this year
PLEASE DONT PRE ORDER!!!
It's just a roster update...
I have an Series X. I like the graphics on there & I just hope it doesn't go in reverse like other 2k's. I did like the gameplay on Current Gen 2k21 better
iPhone: sells the same products each year 2k devs: Well you know what they say. New year, same me am I right!
The last time it was perfect. NBA 2K16 is arguably the greatest NBA 2K game of all time for good reason. They introduced an amazing MyCareer story arc, they rolled out the iconic ProAm, and it featured the one of the best Parks that was ever created. This was the pinnacle of innovation and improvement for the NBA 2K franchise. Sadly, it has been downhill ever since then.
It’s still unfair though
Agent gets a W.  2k22 gets an L.  Not buying.
Common scene tell me if can find in the 5 dollar bid at gamestop its super low budget garage.
I think it funny that. Lot of thee content creators for 2k cry about next gen 2k21 not being good. I have a build that goes crazy on next gen I think you guys just suck at this specific one so that’s why you don’t like it as much lol
Cause it's a scam🤡
2k22 needs to bring back where you can change your clothes and animations while still on the court like 2k17. Also, it needs to stop making you win a game before it actually starts the win streak. And keep the streak going as long as someone from the squad is still standing on the dots
Just fk all of this fk off 2k
Clickbait 🤦🏾‍♂️
Then to Think You finna Charge me 70 bucks After dropping this Poor performance of a game in 21, nahhh, I’m Good.
Bruh this ain’t nobody’s fault but ours. Stop blaming the devs for making the same game and just stop buying the shit. Cause the more you buy their games the more they’re gonna keep making the same shit, but if their sales drop and people stop buying it, maybe it’ll force them to actually improve. But nooo people are stupid and keep buying it just to complain
Trending babyyyy!🔥🔥
No More 2k for me. 2k21 will be 4 years of Disappointment for me. Soooo I’m Good 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
2k16 the best 2k ever made
I just want the old shot meter back from before 2k21
Fluke
People dont understand the weight the game has on its shoulders, 2k will lose like a 1/3 of their fanbase
no cap im not even a Curry fan like that but I feel like curry should've been on the cover or one of the mvp candidates or maybe like all 3 like madden did idk how they made these decisions its super random.
2k gotta get more shit for making us pay $70 then forcing us to pay to upgrade our player for another $50 because the grind fucking sucks
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
I think they should take 2k16 and add the new roster and the new features from the newer games and it would be better than whatever they doing with the game now
it's the same game lol.
DONT BUY THE GAME. They will keep doing this copy and paste shit till it hurts their wallets
Yo the look is same, but the shotstick changed. 21 is the worst 2K ever.
🔥🔥🔥
2k the first game to drop the same game 3 times in one year
It does suck that everyone’s bar on the game is so low and yet it makes billions
I’ll be honest I don’t care for cross-play on NBA 2K I don’t care to deal with the modders on PC. if cross-play does release I would like that fact that it would keep Consol players to play against Consol players #Playstation #Xbox #Nintendo #iPlayAll
Go get the corona test agent make sure you good brother and not spreading.
Candace Parker feeling “proud” to be on an NBA cover, when in reality, everyone including the NBA pities the WNBA, and only included her because they wanted to be inclusive. That’s it. Any low tier NBA player could wipe the floor with Candace, so we already know it has nothing to do with skill. Oh you’re one of the best WNBA players you say? One of the best females the play basketball? That ain’t sayin much. We’re talking about a league and players that can’t even dunk. Only on a cover because you happen to be a female, nothing to feel proud about.
When they change something. It's always something that we didn't ask to change. And they dint even make it better.
New game's about to come out and myplayer is 93 overall since recently
No demo, same game!😂😂
if you've been playing 2k and just found out that the series is trash i got a bridge to sell ya
DEFINITELY MAKE IT OR BREAK IT FOR ALOT OF 2K SPORTS GAMES. NBA,NFL,FIFA,WWE ETC ALOT IS ON THE LINE 2K  All pressure. We as the consumers deserve a good game
Didn't he make a video last year about 2k21 looking like 2k20
Most definitely there make or break year! Everybody gonna start playing streetz Vol 3 again 🤣✌🏾
Money guys. Money. Accept that it's all about money.
Wait so can current Gen people play with next gen people online?
Is, "Anyone, Anywhere," the basketball comparison to WWE2K's "Hit Different"?
Quick fix everyone upset with 2k get your shit together and make your own or don’t buy it .
https://youtube.com/shorts/9k7x4foLUu4?feature=share
i knew 21 was gonna be a mess so i didnt buy it, but i expected it to be more stable / better during 2k22
2k please don’t mess this game up that’s all I’m asking and does anyone else still don’t have a next gen console I haven’t even touched 2k21 next gen and I preordered it 😭
Y make two different games that's stupid
im done with 2k , its never gonna be how it was when it was good
2k has a chance this time there shouldn’t be anymore excuse
Nothing more can be done it’s reached it’s peak the best thing they can do is put an nba Jam mode on it
Cuz you a dumbass for buying it xD
Either way going to buy on sale 😂
Prolly just gonna get 75th anniversary I kinda like the cover more than the others
broooo i been saying this and nobody agrees , that realistic feel of 2k21 is so horrible , like the arcade feel was wayyy better , it made the game fun to play , ik it’s a basketball simulation but it still need to be fun.
Don’t car. Agent low key not good at the game just popular at this point lol
Bro I just came across your channel because you look exactly like a professional skater on a skateboard podcast called the nine club and named Jaron Wilson, such a trip but keep up the content Brody, good shit!
To answer the question posed as the title of this video:  sports gamers are incredibly stupid and they are to be taken advantage of.
I didn’t buy 2k21 cuz yall said it was trash but im gettin 22🤷🏽‍♂️
/WYDB7BRY6ZA/&bih/26
Tencent does not own take two FYI
Agent lookin healthy 🙏🏽💯💪🏽
Why are ya all still surprised that 2k is lazy and repetitive??
Ahahahahaha yup I’m gonna stick with 2k21 on my Xbox one
Almost like sorts games have been doing this for the last 18 years or more
Then quit buying it
You guys are idiots for buying the same game over and over lmao
I hope 2k no trash imma be mad just pre ordered
I'm already looking forward to the 2k22 is trash yadda yadda video...
Go guard sue bird then
Look at Agent man, asking silly questions. So inspirational
They fuck fan  They have only matter for money
2k22 is gonna be the first 2k game I’m ever gonna play. I hope they do release a demo cuz I wanna see what the hype is about
Congrats on getting 15 on trending
You look like og anunoby if his moms was white ...fire vid tho💯😂
I’m not buying the game anymore I’m done playing with 2K ong
i don't know why anyone is surprised it's been the same thing every year for 8 years
That’s just 2k21 but instead of putting remastered they put 22 and put a different person on the cover
just bring back 19 dribble mechanics 😩😩
#make2kgreatagain
Tbh I'm not buying another 2k it's basically a scam because you create a character, spend money on your character to upgrade him, then servers get shut down and you can only play on your character in Blacktop, and that's it I think
Man Agent I think you NAILED it with the idea that 2K should not come out with a game every year. instead give updates per year till we have enough new ideas and content that warrants paying the 60 dollars for a NEW game. We really have the power to control this shit and we fold every fucking year guys. We are getting ROBBED.
Agent on trending 💯💯💯
If you still buy EA Sports games every year then youre dumb. Full Price, same Game, more Lootboxes and Shit. Lol. No fckn Reason tongive this scummy company more money.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈

Same game for the past couple years. Everyone don’t want to play they BS city sh*t. What about the ppl that just want to play the career mode. Can we get roster update in your actual career mode I blame Everyone tht keep buying this garbage
lol yall dont know what yall want
Agent I feel if 2K wants to go for realistic they should try VR and have a throwback 2K game that will be more of the arcade style
2 mill so close
I never want the game to end up being a arcade experience (it somewhat is now) it’s a lot more fun playing a realistic basketball game. 2k already has NBA playgrounds. It’s not fun at all when everyone can do the same moves or have the same build like it is in Myplayer and MyTeam . Gameplay has definitely been catered to children and not the actual fans of the game.
Dumbest title ever... like you expected something different... 🤡
Idk what y’all expected it’s been the same game 😭💀
Bro wheres the imaging of 2k22? Bro stop that shit or I will flag you.
Why does this title look the same as last years?
they copying fifa
Agent would be a great voice actor 🔥😂
If you're still expecting changes on EA games... I'll just say that your faith is missplaced
Doesn’t miss
Never fall for the hype.
lol 2k is like COD, everyone hypes the game up and then 3 months after release complain how this is the worst 2k ever. You know what I did, I stopped playing 2k, last 2k I played was 2k18
Pre orders shows both versions coming out sept 9th 11 pm
y'all be letting youtubers MAKE y'all hate a game you haven't even played yet! lmao.....stupid ass people
All I’m hoping for is a defense buff or bring back the old mechanics this years defense is the worst.
Why does it not make sense to drop both console games on the same day (sept 10)? I completely disagree… it makes no sense to me to delay next gen to an arbitrary date in Oct/Nov as you mentioned
Get better agent🙏🏾
Wow this video is 14 on trending
As long as my career is decent then I'm good
i stoped playing since 2k20 since the game is just the same every year. just stop buying their game and they will listen to the community..
Why is it so hard for 2K to be like 16 or 17
They’ve been doin this for years and y’all dummies still buy the same game for $60+ every year…all they do is Rookies, change teams, and a some sweat and y’all SWEAR it’s a new game
Question  Why does the cover matter? 🤣 Same with Madden , fifa etc
Agent I’ve been a fan for awhile but i’m ngl it seems like you are always complaining. again i really like you but it seems like the more you get upset about the game that pays your bills the more clout you get so you have an incentive to complain
Bro was funny asf
I like big agent better
BANGER
Bruh we knew it wasn't going to change and it's sad lol all the same stuff at least the covers are decent
When I last looked the WNBA version is not on the Xbox store.😂😂😂😂
they put half their budget into the cover
I’ll wait 20 days before I buy 2k22 I don’t want to be scammed again
“Let’s assume it’s correct” lmao that’s what everyone in the comments doing rn assuming
Y’all don’t even see what the fuck the game looks like yet but just listen to Twitter and agent 😂😂😂 judge the game when it comes out
You are not wrong, but also this meme about sporting games being “cut and paste with a new title” has been around for years? A decade? Speaking of cut and paste, it can also apply to YouTube videos….
Agent was right with saying Reddit holds a lot of power in 2k
At least you guys don't play madden. Same thing for the past 4 years
I just need some damn incentives to play pro am, where’s the arena or something
Confirmed: 2K Beach will be a copy paste
There will be no difference she just a cover athlete
Haven’t played 2k since 2k18. Life’s been great 😂
Y'all should have known they weren't changing anything for the new 2k. They put all this time and energy into "the city" that most people didn't even get to play due to the next gen crisis. So they not about to make a brand NEW one until everyone has enjoyed the old one. (plus 2k does this every two years it feels like)
2k can drop shit last minute because they don’t add anything
Bruh 2k22 is dropping on my bday
Havent supported 2K w/ money (2k19 was free on PSN) since 2K16.
Bruh they been doing this shit it .... It makes no sense
I’m straight up not buying 2k22. Not wasting anymore of my money. I’ll just play 2k21 next gen until they kill the server lol. We all know the only thing they’ll do is add extra sweat 🤦🏾‍♂️
Soo candice parker got on the cover just because she is a woman ….. wow ok
another thing is that 2k said that 2k22 pc wont have next gen... last year ON STREAM ronnie said that 2k22 would have next support for the pc. i have no hope for 2k22 especially with the demo not coming out and last year we found so many bugs and glitches with the game. do not have your expectations up for this game.
The same reason the same YouTubers put out hese same videos year after year about ehy the new game looks just like the prior year game. Its because they sell us the same game every year. Thats what happens when there is only 1 company making a product for the nba basketball genre. They have no accountability because there is no competition, why put in work and keep improving the game as long as they have no competition there is mo need to produce a better or even different product year after year
Game is gonna be a 2-pack of ass!
Dude this was straight clickabait
Get well soon my g Agent 💪🏾
Imma be playing 2k22 on 2k20 ig
Plz can we just get 16 or 17 engine with better defense get rid of the shitty shot meter can we get a new one plz and bring the shot mechanics from 18 or 19 plz or 2k is thru
I’m calling it right now 2k23 is gonna be the 2k16 of next gen
Because it's the same fuckin game
It would be fun, IF IT WORKED! OR IF NEXT GEN CONSOLES WERE AVAILABLE!!
This 2k22 will be TRASH. YES, this comment will Age well.
8:06 REAL TALK AGENTTTT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s been a very long time since I watched agent and I can’t believe how much weight you lost I remember I used to watch you and you would be sweating just sitting there big ups agent
do anyone know how cross-gen bundle will work? will i be able to use a player i created on my ps4 on my ps5 account?
On the Day of Atonement 👀
21 was make or break 22 is not gonna be good at all
2k and Madden are Monopolies. We as users need to boycott both games so that they’ll listen to the community when it comes to making the games better. There’s no reason we should have multiple people with that status that they have solely off of 2k and these companies won’t listen to them or their fan base. If we don’t buy I bet they’ll listen.
THE SUBTLEE CLICKBAITTT, great vid tho my
Lol agent said keep hope alive 😂
I still play 2k20.
Damn you lost weight dude, not watched in a minute. Well done getting back to that skinny agent. Thought it was a throw back vid. Big props to you.
Live needs to make a new game
If 22 fails its done for 2k
22 might be dope for me lol I skipped 21
Why would Agent think that the two versions would come out at different times?? They were still developing it for launch last year.... It will most likely drop together.  But imagine getting only the NG Version and it's still ass..😂😂
I'm touching 2k until they put in the actual jelly fam layup package...
Don’t buy this trash again
I swear i’m the only person who still only plays 2K16 because the new games are fucking trash
Its sad that these motherfuckers dont care about the bad ratings they get on their games.... I have been tempted to buy this trash shit every year but I fought my conscience every time refusing to play the same bullshit every year... I really wish they cared about the 2k community and what we have to say to make the game better as a whole. These are greedy money hungry bastards that we need to put a stop too together...🤦🏽‍♂️☹️
"it's like they can't miss" no you are all too dumb to realize you're buying the same game every year 😂
2k a gimmick where’s the NEW LIVE @ EA SPORTS ME PLZ
Itd be cool to have the olympics tournament in this 2k.  Or maybe use the Olympics (for foreign career modes..i guess) as a step to get to the nba from the euro league/Australian league etc
$110 for a 2k22 then an extra $75 to get your player to 85overall that’s aud btw, game should be free $110 standard ps5 addition btw not 75th anniversary game lol, sick of getting ripped off
All I want is for them to open the old servers so if we want we CAN go back
Stopped playing after 2k15 i believe. They been garbage ever since. Best ones were 2k11 and 2k13. The movement was way better IMO
I agree with everything u said until u said u want it more fun.....no sir make it real basketball plz sir🤦🏾‍♂️
You guys want the best basketball game of all time? Don’t buy 2K for two or three years. While doing this, let 2k know about it. I guarantee we will see nothing but perfection from there on out. As long as people keep buying shit, they will keep putting out shit.
no really?
This game is gonna be pretty mid. Probably not buying the legend version lol
There’s no “make or break” year for 2K. It’s a huge game, they’re gonna sell tons of copies, and make insane money post-sell too. As long as they don’t purposely sabotage the game, people will keep eating it up.
When you sick gang just take off
WAGENT please do a myteam series this year 💕
Just don't buy the same shit so they see the numbers drop enough to actually DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
IM DONE WITH 2k lol
U say this shit every year 😂😂 2k is done up
Just a quick comment. WHY TF ARE PEOPLE EXPECTING 2K SERIES TO BE ANY DIFFERENT EACH YEAR? You all get served dog shit year after year with minimal tweaks which they hype up to be game changing and you all get on board with it like some little children when elderly individual offers them with some candy in their car. Same shit with FIFA, exactly the same franchise. Stop it, just stop buying it or at least those vc coins bs
I thought you left the 2k community
if 2k22 if trash i’m never getting another 2k game again this is their last chance
The build tester should account for the +4 at 99. It says we’re testing at 99, but it’s really 95.
The only thing that ever changes on these damn, games is an increase in price!
Do a video getting all the 2k21 from other countries with the different covers ans languages
What did people expect
No next gen for PC so sad
A couple years?? Bruh it hasn’t even been a year🤣🤣🤣
I wanna know why people continue to buy this game ?
Bro save y’all all some time, 2k brings the same park after the game they dropped 🤡 Ronald is dumb they put the same parks just with different rewards and some weak ass animations
This is the best chance for EA.
Yoo they should add overseas
Bruh I dont know why you dont cover another game this game is a lost cause
They’re marketing to KIDS not grown men
Its on us at this point. 2k literally does the same shady sh*t EVERY YEAR 🤡🔫
agent on trending yessir
"Next gen" is now "current gen". Especially on PC there is no reason that the game has not the exact same features than the newest consoles has.  But they did it with 2k21 and it seemed to work cause people bought it. So its pretty reasonable that they´ll do it again with 22.  Sad... but true.
Start playing fifa 😂😂😂
15 16 17 great years 18 20 21 horrible years 19 was in the middle we due for a great year
Agent and Flight is on the devs as*
If this one sucks 2k has completed a 3 peat of garbage NBA games
I wonder if the shot meter will be different or same from the 2k21  Hopefully it changes this year in 2K22 🏀🔥
Nba live ????
only old thing i want is 2k19 or 2k17 dribble system. bcz it was so acradey
Doesn’t mater y’all will but it and they while laugh at yall
No one wants to get excited for a Luka cover 😑  It’s not even badass. Looks like a pussy cover 😒  I have a strong feeling this game will suck
They need to add back double takeover
Nobody gonna buy the wnba version lol
All that money and the game is literally getting worse...i don't even play that game anymore...im gonna wait a couple of weeks this time untill i purchase
2k no good zame shittttt evry time
OCE servers?
Ima get the pre order tmr
Ronnie said that 2k22 was gonna be in The same city
I think it would add more to the game if they added a online/offline all-star weekend. Making it possible for you to play the three point contest and dunk contest without having to go through entire seasons in mycareer or other modes. Just my thoughts.
Agent sound like a younger version of himself
Y’all should stop buying the game then so they can actually improve it
So does the anniversary edition also come with cross-gen like last year?
I’m not playing 2k until they actually improve the game. Vote with your money people!
Lol it’s a basketball game how much more do you think you can change when you have yearly Cycles😂
2k23 it is. Maybe live will have a chance.😭🥲#thedarkestimes
Bro juss stop playing the game if its that bad🤦🏽‍♂️
You dumb little NBA fans are so funny it’s the same thing every year theirs So little of the game differences you get excited who will be on the cover🤦‍♂️😂😂😂
LMAAOO THIS IS TRENDING
They have all looked the same goddammit it’s nba2k so nothing changes year after year after year
its like yall hate on 2k no matter what update or change they make a lot of ppl are always hating, even if they brung something new to the game or changed the whole park its STILL gonna get hated on yet yall still playing the game. stop playing the game then find something else to hate on.
How are we gonna expect them to improve a game that we consistently pay for, regardless of quality?
Reddit holds the power unfortunately😭
I was finna say your voice sounds completely different and I didn’t know if it was a new mic or what.
1:52 seventy firth, Flight said it the same way
I’m just done man… that’s it. I’m just not buying 2k this year. Honestly seeing how money hungry they keep on getting I’m probably just gonna quit the series as a whole. There’s just way better games out there
Agent don't know was he's talking about lol smh
it's been fun kids...I'm retired from video games but wanted to see what Agent's opinion was on the new 2K. It's the micro-transactions for me.
What do y’all mean …fun… I’m confused
Realism is fun ! I’m tired of all these fake ass games and fake ass animations ! We want real physics and realism . I play the game because I like that sport
Fix the game rather than working on doing performative action like putting Candace Parker on the cover 🤦🏽‍♀️
Extremely confused why KD is on the cover with those two legends and why Candace Parker is even on a cover for a 2k game lol.
THE CHINESE GOV IS OPPRESSIVE. HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. FORCED CHILD LABOR. WE HAVE TO STOP GIVING THEM MONEY. THEY OWN OUR POLITICIANS, INCLUDING BIDEN. THEY ARE TAKING OVER AMERICA RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES. NO INVASION, SIMPLY OWN EVERYTHING, THEN THEY MAKE ALL THE RULES.
I just want one thing I dont know if it is possible but I want an option to choose your shot meter like you can use the 2k15, 16, 17, etc. That would make me really want to buy it
Nba2k21 crashing x box series x and s fix! Reply and I will gladly tell you how to fix that. You do not need to send in your console to micrisoft
and we continue to buy this bullshit🥲
I don’t care what anyone says but until the day the community is pushing and advocating for us to switch to Live, I will not get my hopes up ever with 2k. We are at the point where we need to force the competition ladies and gentlemen and only ones that can compete with 2k is Live hate to say it but it’s the cold hearted truth. I don’t see this game worth buying
I love the cover with KD, Kareem and Dirk.
nobody buy this game it’s the only way they gone actually try
Nba 2k21 next gen gameplay is so bad I don’t think they will ever recover.
I wonder how 2k22 will play on the ps4 lol might be the same as the last 2 games graphics will be the same
Good basketball gameplay, and good rewards. That’s all they need to appeal to majority
If you put your shutter speed up, you won't go out of focus when you move like that. You can slightly up the iso to make up for lost light if you have to. Great vid!!
Everyone just boycott the game 😂😂
Either they can’t miss or we just like buying bullshit
19 was not a good game lmao road to 99 was the worst thing ever
Current gen is the PS5
I’m not wasting mine or my parents money on 2k unless there’s evidence that it’s good, basically after a month or so
Are they bringing back the shot meter from 2k20?
the only way to improve 2k is to stop buying the game and vc 💀….unfortunately people will bite every year it’s sickening tbh
they get the most cash from vc
2K22 is going to be the make or break of whether I hop onto NBALive when it drops or not 😂
Ngl I might sound Ed but can anyone tell me what nba 2k22 cross gen is?
Why is Candace Parker a cover athlete when she would get destroyed by anyone who plays basketball for a Jr College?  Lmao.
get well soon 🤞🏼
Because it’s a basketball game
same trash every year dont waste ur money guys
Bruh it’s 2K. The game only changes a little every few years
Naw bruh we about that making it real as possible,  all that other badges etc.. get rid of it
New house & living with the bros... = Agent getting covid... Hate to see it
Nba2k19 is mid asf
That's why I stopped buying 2k
Next gen will release the same day as last gen. Why would they release the next gen version in November? When the next gen consoles are already out?
Click bait
Stop buying "2k covers" every year! 🤣 Go to NBA2K page save the image of "new cover athlete".. Print it.. slap it to your OLD 2K!! 🤣 Same shi*  bruhh 🤷 #SMH
its 2k thats why Im just happen wwe gonna get a good game this year
how is it a realistic basketball experience and im can shoot in somebodys eye when they have their hand down
Agent’s slowly becoming the clickbait king
2 choices! Remaster 2k11 or stop making this trash a** game. This franchise is dead, has been cremated, and flushed down the fn toilet. Its over
CAN WE GET SQAURE+TRIANGLE to steal lobs finally im tored of seeing it coming and cant stop it
Idc about the graphics there great but goddamit if this year they dont make it to where we can shoot middys and step back threes consistently Ima be pissed because that is real life basketball now…. next bring back 2k19s layup system and fix animations based on vertical for offense and defense… JOKIC doesnt even jump ever in real life but yet his head touches the rim for chase down vlocks in 2k
Not even bothering this year
if i play on ps4 can i buy the legend edition and play next gen?
2k not expensive, inflation just hiking the price.  Same value just the money has less purchasing power making it optically more expensive.
Content creators: yeah 2k22 sucks  Also content creators: yeah I mean I do need money so WASUP GUY
Our name’s gonna be “mp” if you watch the 2k Luka video then you can here him say “what’s up mp”
2k is NOT owned by tencent games.
Because you can’t update one game while devolving a completely different game in just a year
It’s not like we have ps5’s in stock tho…
Y’all keep buying it 🤣✌🏻
the gameplay is horrible agent come on my guy.......
$70 no thanks i guarantee 22 will be just as terrible its all about the 💰
“Real life simulation” like everyone on next gen being 6’7🤦🏿‍♂️
Game drops exactly on my birthday….
I think best too wait 2 yrs till get a new one or when it’s on sale
Your my fav
"trying to get to a realistic basketball game" dying everytime someone gets a bump or dropping the ball and breaking both my ankles is not realistic. just me though.
i was able to stop buying them sorry ass madden games now i gotta stop buyin 2k, i love playin both sports but their games are too ass for me to handle🤦🏾‍♂️😭
It says it comes on sept 9th on the Xbox store for next-gen
Same trick?
Bro you say the same shit every year... yet you always go back to 2K until "WE ALL STAND TOGETHER and don't buy 2K22 OR 2K23" they will keep shitting on us and we'll keep feeding on it.
Agent forgot 2k17
Shit gonna be trash as always
That’s bullshit about you saying the gameplay is trash the defense is horrible my player movement is trash and no skill gap
If Reddit held power the game would be fixed you fucking bootlicker, how much does 2k pay u bruh 🤡🤡🤡
they sell cuz they lie to get you to buy 😂
Agent 00 remember you was on 2ktv...last year...and Mike Wang ask you what 2k Needed to do..and you Said...Have Ranked and UnRanked Parks....Casuals from Compy Comp...he StiLL Didn't do it...Mike Wang Still Didn't do it....Mike Wang is Hard Headed
I’m so done with 2k I’m giving up PlayStation to go to PC. Def not playing that trash game on pc
I mean to be fair, NBA 2K21 Next Gen hasn’t been out that long, why would they waste more money on a new city considering they literally JUST MADE THIS. I know 2K is toxic but this is just being greedy
EA is 100x the company 2k is bruh, I’m not playing 2k
Damn this guy is the god of clickbait titles and I fell for it again
If there gonna uplement something pls be cross-gen
They telling you you ain't gone do shit but spend a grip of money and get nothin for it
As long as yall are spending so much money pre-ordering all these different editions, buying all the VC and all that.. nothing's gonna change. Vote with your money :/ They don't care about nothin else sadly.
Damn and we still gon buy it 😂😂
realism doesn't make it not fun, everyone playing the same exact way with the same build makes it not fun. not having mini tournaments makes it not fun. bump steals make it not fcking fun lol & lack of innovation. having a fake overall makes it not fun.
If they bring back 2k20 shooting mechanics and dribbling ill buy the game ong i jus wanna wake up and tun on 2k and have fun🥺
so happy for healthy agent man
Their talking about 2k22, even though 2k21 next gen is still broken, when I was a rookie in the park, it was unplayable, because it would freeze for like 3 seconds
The gameplay was terrible.  Stiff movement.  Defense was none existent.  Stiff defense. The realism want there when it came to movement and animations.  They are so behind when it comes to games progressing with technology.
Click bait double zero
I just bought nba2k21 next gen for ps5 for $20 off amazon a week ago
Just so you know your title has nothing to do with the video
They did announce that there will be a cross gen so if you have a Xbox 1 or PS4 you will be able to get the ps5 version but it will be $79.99
Agent 2k vids = great
Yall do realize basketball has not changed much.. Dribble pass shoot defend.. So when y’all complain about the game not changing much I know y’all can’t play or just don’t appreciate the art of the game.. It’s a SIMULATION video game.. A mock of the game on the court.. Smh
Imagine giving us a 2k we can’t test. Which means…“Here, take out recycled bullsh** game.” Yet we all can’t come together as a community and boycott 2k to give us what we want.
Im waiting for nba live 22
I don’t care for 2k but why you keep talking bad about it even though you gonna play it every year it comes out
I'm gonna keep playing 20 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You expected different? Its gonna be the same game. With contact blocks. . . .
2k thinks its sweet right now..... wait till nba live come out with some fire 🔥 its over
What are you surprised about?
Why is 2k22 not happening on Stadia?
Bring back creating a legend
How you gon have retired player WNBA Candace & dirk for 22 I ain’t a reminding type dude everything in the moment lol
Damn I miss the 2k community I was playing in 2k20 and haven’t even touched 21 y’all gotta play different games
agent you better not scream in nih video when the shit drop.
First year I won’t be buying this trash can’t do it no more barely played it this year
I gotta give this guy a thumbs down and never watch a video by him again for the fact that he said a $70 game "don't gotta be perfect, it just gotta be functional." How much they paying you brah?
well no wonder they can't miss with their earnings each year because they shut down the old servers so people have to buy their "new game" just to play online which is what MOST people buy the game for... #BringBack2K17
not that they cant miss on game sales, there's literally nothing else to rival it
I literally don’t have any high hopes for the damn game anymore 21 literally ruined my whole thought on 2k 😐 I hope the sells drop to shit so they relies that they need to take these shi serious 🙃
Why KD on there he still playing
Agent where the hell is low
Hit up lolo my guy she's thinking about you 😂
I'm not buying it lol if they want me to play it add it to game pass
Might be a hot take but just bring back oops from 2k15 and we good
All I see on social media are 12 year old Virgins calling Candice Parker a dishwasher🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️shits corny asl
I saw that backpack n arm sleeve as a reward I bout to lose it
Lol what did y'all except something new??????😭😭😭 It's 2k they only care about money.
I hate that they put Candace on the cover when everybody on the verge of not getting the game. Cause I would love to get that cover but fuck 2k
So... where is the screenshot from the video thumbnail?   I think I just got baited lmao
We’re gonna get updates
Like RDC said i think 2k actually jus release half the game meaning somethin u cant stop (speed glitch) nd then throw ads in our face nd drop a shirt inna store for 30k which is $30 for a virtual game shirt
Battlefield 2042 coming out . Fuck 2k
We all know how 2k gonna give us another bs 2k with hella shit broken in the game . 2k don’t give a fuck about 2k community
Dirk rlly don’t know who kd and Kareem is?
Y'all niggas fall for THE SAME SHIT every year
They just need to find a way to make the game feel not so repetitive
After 2k18 the games just feel like we're paying for patches rather tha for a new game
Better question: Why is NBA 2k22 still not putting next gen on PC. Which leads us exactly to why it looks like 2k21.  I'll say it slow for you.. THEY..ARE..PLAYING..YOU!
What if you buy the 75th anniversary game do you get a 100k on both games so, you can get 200k combined if they give your vc on both games
I ain’t gon lie this line hit “comparison we don’t like war but we like call of duty” amen agent it’s a fuccin video game
You don’t even play 2k….
honestly there makin the games bad on purpose cause they just want us to come back and see if its fixed but it never will
We’d take some of this seriousness and reflection of realism in the Madden community. Madden is ass and boring so it could always be worse
right by default I’m just looking forward to something… I miss 2k19 took a minute but I didn’t mind 20 but 21 current was just damn near unplayable (without breaking something) because it was ridiculous trying to do simple **** like standing  still
Next Gen is horrible. The gameplay is trash.  Defense is so bad
So which on is on p4? Cause I'm p4 and don't know Wich ones I can pick from?
Yo it trending your video let go!
I read the title and immediately said “Y’all still asking that question?”
Crazy how 2k don't wanna spend money on cross play but expect ppl to pre order with no game details 😒
Why make a demo if you see its the same shit you not gone buy it. So they will make you buy it or be mad you brought it lk MADDEN nooooooooooooo what is new now....
Dirk Trolling 🤣🤣🤣
2k21 I finally hit my wall. I paid for the game, paid for the VC, and literally 2nd career game, I just said nope.  Every so often came back to it and tried to play a franchise and the gameplay was just so blah. Not fun. Not enjoyable. Dribbling felt so awkward. Couldn't go more than 2-3 games before i was just beyond bored.  This year I really just lost hope.  I want 2k22 to be good, also don't want continue giving my money away blindly in support of a crap product.
Where was this energy when you were on 2ktv
Smh...everybody  in these comments gone buy it..why complain
Lmao now it's a problem. Lol damn near every park looked alike
if you want them to  change, dont support this game. let it fail and they will actually do something.
So why do u buy it if u don’t like it don’t buy it I love 2k that why I buy it so wht
They aint a demo because they didn't want people to see it's exactly like 2k21
"are they gonna do something cause it's the right thing to do...?" ❌  So sad but so true  2k franchise has so many faithful followers, that no matter how down bad the game get, will spend their money Does 2k give that love back? HELL NAH
Smh..I mean..what do yall expect? This only the second entry of a new era, 9f course its gonna look the same..yall expectations are too high
If only 2k16 servers were on
Redo 2k11 styles with a 2022 feel. We just wont a working game at least
I'm just sad that we're not getting next gen version on PC
Kim Kardashian purple on My team
God bless everyone. Give your life unto Jesus follow God 🙏
Agent sounding like Urkle
Still can’t get a ps5 yet🤦🏻‍♂️
2k22 is my year
All i know is, if this shit is ass. I'm on 2k20 till server dies. Then I maybe hanging them up for good.
either way ppl will still buy 2k22 and then later on complain abt the game getting no update and saying the previous ones were better
I Remember when 2k used to be $19.99 on release 😂
Why don’t we all just not buy 2k22 forcing them to make 23 good
One of the best videos I've seen. Thank you Agent for your honest work.
Set up looks so dope man, congrats on the house man
I bought the last few 2k games but I think I’m good on this one
Demo or beta is crucial for player feedback…you said it best Agent they need to just make 2K online and charge for cosmetic stuff and dlc…I refuse to throw money at these lazy assholes every year when they can’t even get server issues fixed…Reddit does have all the power and we could make them be more “inclusive” by everyone boycotting their money hungry cash grabbing game…no demo so we don’t complain and we just buy  and only sold so many copies because we bought their PR bs especially with next gen release, expectations completely diminished, let us play in unique basketball courts around the world, how hard is it to make something new instead of coot and pasting every year
just want offline mycareer
Been stopped playing 2k after 2k19. Didn’t buy 2k20, didn’t buy 2k21, but I’m still watching agents videos lol
I don’t really like the Doncic cover idk
I'm new to 2k basketball....is it normal that your team doesn't know how to rebound or they forget how to pick up  a loose ball?
They want to be paid to do the right thing... aren’t we paying 70$ for the game? And then at least another 100$ for the VC
Who still playing 2k20?🙋‍♂️
But why do OCE players have to play on Asian servers with +300 ping...
Yall expected different? Crazy
watch badgeplugs videos on it its a good vid about this type of info
they keep coming up with gimmicks instead of pushing out a good game. Have MTX or whatever just make the game solid.
it’s official, the city is back in 2k22. start watching at one min nineteen sec.  https://youtu.be/Hrv8ML0G_3k
I swear to god if Next gen doesn't drop until November again I'm not buying it
No crossplay = another skipped year of 2k, haven’t played nor bought a 2k since 19
They should go back to the past 2k’s but add on to them as Agent said. Add more animals , maybe I would want to roll in the park with a monkey on my back or a Elephant walking beside me. They NEED to add better rewards and better things that you can do in the game so it keeps us coming back and actually having something to play for. Also they should bring back custom T-Shirts.   2k is a billion dollar company, they can add many other cool stuff to the game and I believe they have the technology for that. But the 2k developers are lazy , more you tubers need to give feedback instead of worrying about a virtual logo…Give constructive feedback so the game can improve year to year!
Of course they had a good year, no competition lol
They ain’t got no competition so it’s gon be the same every year just like madden
If there no demo I have to take 1 week to my build
2k11 🐐
Bro the game trash already🤦🏾‍♂️
Man I’m still on 2k20 old gen 😂
I mean that thumbnail agent actually looks surprised 🤣🤣🤣,  its been 4 yrs,, it took me 3 to tap out,and I WILL NOT be returning till the game has a major overhaul ...... Even then idk,pay to win just ain't it no more
They keep the same park for 2 years lol y’all should get the trend by now
This is not agent this is a person wit edits and photoshop he don’t got eyebrows 👀
Troydan is single-handedly funding 2k ngl
So if you have Ps5 and you want both ps5 version and current gen version  you gotta get the,  cross gen digital bundle or the legend Edition right?
I have a PS5, but didn’t buy next gen because I’m tired of 2k being this trash. It’s just not worth my money. Especially 70. Not even when it’s on sale for 20. Y’all complain but buy it day 1 anyways and play it constantly, Beyond me.
I hate how Agent keeps trying to push 2K19 with games like 16, and 11 lmao. 19 isn’t even better than 17, 15, or maybe even 20.
the wnba is gamestop only so if you don’t want it but digital
I'm sticking with 2k21 current gen especially after spending 70 dollars man 😐
cause yall stupid lol
Why nba logo hasn’t changed lol
chinese market.... B FRESH???????
crossplay is the least they could do for this wack ass franchise
If they make the game free I’d consider it
Can’t believe Candice got her own personal cover before curry
Yes female players for the girls not for you weirdos who wanna troll by making a female player y'all weird asf
NBA Live 19 hardest out right now
I don't even wanna buy it now. Cause they talking about the city coming back. The city is boring to me bruh. Why can't they just make the game good bro
You mean the same way 2K20 looked exactly like 2K19? No way 2K would NEVER do that
With cross gen can I play 2k with my friends while there on ps4 and I’m on ps5
We don’t care about covers because most people download it. Even if u don’t. It’s just a cover on the case you’re going to put somewhere after opening it and not thinking about it lol
Am I optimistic for 2k22 no I'm not
11B here. I like war 🤷🏿‍♂️
They’ve ignored 2k21 next gen since it was released, they better release a polished game. 2k21 next gen was not it…at all
Am I the only one who still gonna play 2k. I mean yeah there garbage 2ks compared to others but at the end of the day it's still basketball. I still find ways to enjoy it and have fun with my squad. People be complaining but still playing. There ain't no better basketball games out there anyways. And plus I still somewhat enjoyed 2k21 lol, even tho it's not as good as previous years, I still made of it. I play bbal irl and need to play bbal on my console.
Let's be honest, what we want is international leagues and teams just like FIFA, and the option to play overseas or college prior to joining the league and also being in the FIBA world cup selections, also being able to have your friends as A.I in the game in the 2k my career world and have open worlds like arenas and campuses with interactive worlds would be amazing!!
this is just ad how they taking our money from us atp 2k22 is gonna suck im done
Parker made more money out of that cover then she did from the WNBA for the whole year.
Bro we been knowing this, 2k has no hope under Ronnie rule
Go make more amp videos with duke
2Ks *NUMBER* 1 hater is back😂😂😂 but i do  agree why is the park THE same!?!?!
100,000% not buying this dog shit! Thier stealing our money, doing absolutely nothing for months and absolutely making a killing just on the base game 😂.
Just Please bring back regular parks or neighborhood …!!!! THE CITY AINT IT 😑😭…FIX YOUR DEFENSE SLIDERS
It’s crazy how y’all 2k players buy a new 2k every year when the amount of content they drop can be installed through updates😂😂😂😂 y’all down so bad
2K doesn't realize yet that Europeans athletes (Football players especially) play mostly on Sony while American athletes play on XBox.    Same goes for Youtubers. Some play on Xbox and others on Playstation  Adding in crossplay will remove the staleness from the game that some gamers experience because it will add a new dimension of seeing YouTube and athletes co-op or compete more on stream and that alone will be a reason to hop on again
At this point i need a 2k11 Remaster
honestly I feel like this is going to be the first game I'm going to skip since the lockout year.
I really don’t have high hopes for 2K22 honestly I didn’t buy 2K20 and I didn’t play 2K21 that much at this point I feel like 2K doesn’t really care about fixing the problems within the game all they care about is money once they release it I’m hoping 2K22 is good but I doubt it will be
I stopped buying 2K years ago either my girl buying or a friend other than that I’ve lost all hope for 2K.
if yall buy this game your deadass just a sheep
I don’t even care about the graphics. I just want more content more offline content I want to be able to create a legit superstar in my career and have a more in-depth my career experience. Not everyone wants to play online my team park/city.
Lemme get my crystal ball one sec.......................  2k releases demo: its an overall good game, seems balanced, fair. The 2k community collectively says maybe this is the year we won't get fucked..  2k22 drops: the game is updated day one to remove every essence of a balance game cuz you gotta buy VC, right.....  One week later: the game gets 20, no, 75⅔ of updates and patches to completely break the game...........  Month later: people say 2k trash, go back to playing some other 2k game where they don't shut the servers down to force you into buy the new game.....................  10 months later: hey, we got Jake paul to be on the cover of 2k23.  Naa this magic ball trippin trippin *toss*      Is it doe  👀 👀.....       Servers still finna be trash...
I’m good on 2K. 2k21 next-gen was inexcusable. They never even tried to fix the last game and they’re trying to sell us another one? How do you mess up the FIRST game on next-gen consoles and then NEVER even attempt to fix it??? The audacity.
Agents shirts be drunk af
Can yall stop buying the game so they can improve it
That’s bs , I’m not finnah work on a current gen my player for next gen to come out 2 months later .
Bruh they released 2k22 so quick
all the niggas who pressed over Candace Parker having a cover weirdos fr
Agent I will make it my duty to find you the perfect basketball lady since Duke took yours. Don’t worry, justice will be served.
Advertising more than gameplay improvement. Fuk 2K bring back Sega Sports.
Smaller City  Remake REC center (everything)  Defense!!!!!!
I waited for 2k21 to go on sale might do the same for 2k22 my problem is paying full price for a half ass game.
Still the same shit.
I just got a PS5 two weeks ago, I been debating should I get next gen 2k21?
It wouldn't make sense for them to release ps4/xbox1 versions earlier than ps5/xsx versions. That logic only make sense for when the new consoles came out past that date. But since those consoles are here already everyone gets their versions at the same time
I don’t what they same there coming out with I’m not buying it
Man I'm still shocked over the weight loss!!!! Good stuff 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
8 million dumbasses getting swindled year after year. Wake up folks....
You didn’t mentioned NBA2K16!
im not spending a dollar on the game unless theres a deal thats impossible to pass up, other than that battlefield and alot of more games have my money
I’m probably not gonna get 2k22
We staying on 21
It’s literally the same game what did you expect, it’s been like this for 4 games straight
As of right now, both current and next gen (according to our system at GameStop) are releasing at the same day and time.
Not purchasing the game this year at all. Y’all be safe tho🔥
scammer its the same but he just put nba2k22
Oh no luka gonna get traded cause the 2k curse
I’m so sick of 2k and their bullshit.
Im still stuck at 2k20
This dude just complain about everything
2k YouTubers hate on the new 2k release every single year up until it drops, then they hype it up like it's actually good. 2k just isn't the same as it used to be. It's stale, and with such minimal updates each year, 2k should really just go the warzone/Fortnite route and just have seasons.
Eww people still play this bs game?
Agent sound like old agent with the deep voice
It’s honestly disappointing how much love the community gives towards 2k and 2k done even appreciate the love by listening to us💯
I’m surprised they haven’t focused on PC gaming seeing as how Many people have switched to PC in recent years
The WNBA cover is gonna be the same as the base with a little tweaks I think
I don’t like dirk on the cover they should of put Duncan over him
NBA 2K DEVOLOPERS OK NOW THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER TEAM TO WORK ON THIS NEW GAME ANYONE HAVE ANY BRILLIANT IDEAS?  : NEW DEV PLENTY OF IDEAS 💡   :MIKE WANG WHISPERS YEAH FIRE THAT GUY RIGHT THERE. YOU ALL KNOW THE  MOTTO PEOPLE COPY AND PASTE
All yall complaining but end up buying the damn game SMH
15 good - 16 great - 17 great - 18 horrible - 19 great - 20 great - 21 mid - 22.... There might be some pattern here.
10:37 I Don't think 2k is gonna have a make or break year until people stop buying
Ngl I don’t want to grind badges
For the first time in a year I can see Agent’s neck again 😇🙏🏽 you love to see it
im not tryna throw no shade but its prolly partly cuz of youtubers   ppl rly only play online games, if not, they sim season n not rly play.  so knowin that thats whats poppin, 2k wont bother to work on the core game. work on new game modes like they did before everybody only cared abt online game modes  remember when they had legends mode, the jordan challenge, lebron path to greatness.... years later these game modes STILL hold up n are def worth coming back to  do newer games have that? no.  online is where they make the money. youtubers drive up the hype for that.
I cant wait til 2ks nba contract is over and you ungrateful people can have ea nba live to only play
Dbg already said this early
I enjoy playing basketball IRL though...I wouldn't want to go to war lol
7:45 The content creators make it fun. If everyone saying it's ass of course the casual players are going to say the same. On top of that, not everyone has a next-gen console. 2k20 wasn't good but the wagers and etc made it fun and interesting. So basically content creators have to carry 2k.....again.
2k they never listen  BIG CAP RON
Can we conclude that Agent is trash at 2k
Im kinda tired of it...
Candace Parker one is a L
Tencent owns 2k?? Where are you getting this? Take Two owns 2k.
just hoping for a change
Staying on 20 till i die
Ummm... no beta no demo no buy 💁🏾‍♂️. I'm done with this trickery.
Dude it looks Like Agent Got in a Time Machine and Brought back The Old Agent.
WNBA lol
WHEN ARE YAL GONNA GET IT! 2K RECYCLES EVERYTHING FOR AT LEAST 2 years!
That doesn’t make sense for them to drop the next gen game months later … they didn’t do that for 2k15
I didn’t buy this years edition, and most likely I won’t buy another til they get rid of micro transactions. I paid 60 dollars for this game, I’m not paying more. And don’t even get me started on how they never update franchise, which is my preferred mode. Edit: oh yeah it’s 70 bucks now  Even worse
No demo means they scared to reveal the trash 🗑
I just hope they fix the shooting
*Can we all just not buy the game lmao*
Is it gonna be on pc? Also I wish karma would come bite these scammers in the ass
Now what about the zen people did they take that out so annoying
It hasn't even been 1 year since next gen consoles been out, what ya mean been out couple of years 🤣🤣
I love this game please be good my first 2k was 2k16 and the rest of them have been trash i missed 2k19 you need a good game after 2 dog awful 2ks if you don’t want your sales to fall like crazy
Please don’t buy it 😂
I feel like a copy and paste of 2k20 with 2k17 and 15 parks and 2k19 dribbling is a good 2k
So no demo so we buy it blind 😂
2K the type to put Shohei Ohtani on the cover of the Japanese edition
BRO 2k is ASSSSSSS
Because 2K believes its Community is stupid. But hey let's be honest, they have been correct for 5 years straight.
why Durant he’s not dead or retired ? Idk so why Durant on there
Bet y’all still buy it tho with no gameplay 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
I just want em to launch an south America server
I ain’t buying SHIT until I see your review on it. 2k21 next gen was so fucking disappointing I refuse to buy their product anymore until I KNOW what the gameplay is like and if it’s even worth playing all year. 🤦🏽‍♂️ I can’t believe a Triple A company release this dogshit product and got away with it.
It's a shame well never see the 2k 16 style much player creation ever again. The main reason being greed. They dont want us to be able to make complete player so we have to make multiple players to fill roles as needed . They want us spending $50 each time we make a new player. Its quite pathetic and I quit playing because of this .  They have games like red dead that they also refuse to support properly as well.  Instead of making new content for loyal fans they butcher outlr ability to earn gold . If they would gi e us good content I could overlook this but they won't. The updates for that game just keep getting worse.  So take 2 can go fuck them selves I'm done playing any games made by them. Hopefully more people become wise to this and boycott their products like I have.
Yeah I don’t normally buy the big 2k with the different cover but I’m for damn sure not buying it now
its wild there are different experiences from xbox ps5 and pc pc is full of cheaters lmao and nonthing happens about it
Is pro am gonna fucking work
I used ro be so hyped for the new 2k, now, I could not give one sh*t
I see Kareem on the cover so I have some hope...
love the new amp house background 🔥
Title: why does 2k look the same Me: Cuz it is lol
Why the hell do people still buy this garbage
Does tencent own 2k? Isn't 2k under Take2? And isn't Take2 as american as you can be?
All we want is old stuff, because that's   what worked and they take it away😭 and literally shut it down for money.   Don't buy the next product for a month or 2 in. Don't let them scam you again life been tuff enough
Blessed I didn’t wast my money on 2k21🙏
I don't buy that shit that Sony ask for money for crossplay, there are a lot of small games from companies that don't have the biggest bags of money and have crossplay
Is 2k22 cross generation?
Everybody should hold out for the first 2 weeks to see if the game is good. This maybe a potential same park on 2k22. Game will be straight trash if that's the Case
Y’all really still play this jawn🤣🤣🤣
What we really need is for 2K to not have a monopoly on the basketball simulation genre
Love what ya do agent🤟🏽
Durrrrrrannnnntttt? Why he a legend I mean he can score and is top tier but a legend nah
So nba 75th edition comes with both gens?
This year is for sure make or break for 2k
A bruh we need different devs😂😂😂 this is fuckin crazy. Did they really just say we have cross progression in myteam😂😂💀 like we don’t already have that shit💀💀💀 I hope nba live come out😂😂😂cus I’m done with Ronnie ass😂😂💀
title is cap
You know it’s real cause agent doesn’t click bait 22 every single day
"It's too early"  Isn't the game like 2 months away???
The demo? Oh you mean the free trial?
2k21 was the most boring game I ever played. Will never buy 2k again unless it is hugely improved. Also remember 2k goes on sale 24/7 so the money they report isn’t accurate
What if they added female myplayers that were better at diiferent things then the male myplayers, Like a female stretch might be more agile but way less dominant in the paint (like cant dunk at all) and defense while the male counterpart would be more solid on defense and finishing but slower/heavier, or a normal fem big would be better at getting steals, perimiter defense, faster and better at shooting like the glass-lock from 2k20 that can shoot but cant dunk but has higher close shot and floater tends (I think floater should become a new category in finishing too)while the male will be more explosive and get contacts while snatch blocking etc.
So this is basically a click-bait title… but nice info. I guess😒
Didn’t buy the last 2k won’t buy this one I’m not gonna support a company who doesn’t care about the quality of the game
More money is allocated to advertising for the past 3 years. Say I'm lyin
It’s funny to see the 2k community always shocked when they find out the 2k lie and reuse  the same things lol they been doing this since 2016/2017 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Agents camera is amazing
The demo is trash
I dont think 2k21 was terrible.    But shooting in offline gameplay was horseshit.  Probably shooting in general was trash.
I wish they get rid of the fucking shot guide above the head . put it back at the feet
The only thing they get right or does their job correctly is the cover artist. All the other crap looks to be rinse and repeat.  Instead of the infamous play shot let's get ready for post scoring, 3pt shooting, dribbling 7ft Demigods.
The only thing that made me stop playing what’s the constant posters…. 5/7 possessions someone was able to get one
Bro honestly 2k will never get it together at this point smh so I’ll just settle for at least no lagging, that’s all I want lol
I swear if it's the same shit again I'm done. I can't take another copy and paste lol
“Next gen” should now be current gen
Cuz it's not really 2k22 its recycled from the past yr wit a new cover is all ur getting 😆 yall just won't learn huh man 2k doesn't have to cater to us anymore they already got our bread form previous 2ks and it'll continue because u streamers gotta get it for algorithms so they can make a recycled gm each yr and mfs gonna buy it regardless exactly why I switched back to RDR2 online and UFC fuck 2k didn't buy 21 not getting 22 either I'm done wasting my bread on these buffoons at 2k I definitely don't miss garbage ass teammates shit I can do bad by myself
There are weirdos who have already pre ordered bro…. Today…
The finesse continues 🤷🏿‍♂️
I feel like there's no cross play cause of PC players hacking
They could come together and get it done but they choose to allow the virus to make it not so good. Just be tested and all stay together till the job is done, life at the same building until it done to keep exposure away, if it scares you.
It will come out broken, half baked money grab. Server issues, lag, error codes, stupid gameplay. Tons of horrible basketball logic and people still finna buy that shit
Not getting 2k22
This is the most solemn I’ve ever seen agent in a video for a coming game lol
I can already smell the vc cash grab
In there the defense I don't think the game visually should look much different, next gen ain't really hit they need to improve gameplay not graphics that we just got less than a year ago
Look I know some people is happy for the release of NBA 2K22 but let's be honest here and I think that next gen and current gen is gonna get the same game from this year current gen-same neighborhood beach whatever and next gen-same city but Agent u said something about that Ronnie and the 2K devs is gonna do some improvement smh in my opinion I don't think that is gonna happen and tell me when did Ronnie ever told the truth to the 2K community huh okay go ahead and believe what he said smh i don't believe nothing that guy says (2K19 and 2K20 same neighborhood same reward for getting 99 overall) all I'm saying is I'm just waiting for a disappointment from the 2K community for the game cuz if its that bad all I'm gonna say is I told u so I'm not gonna get hyped for this game cuz I know its gonna be copy and paste from NBA 2K21 current and next gen
So it’s not fun cause youtubers can’t spam shit anymore and it’s more balanced from working people to no life’s🤔🤔aight
This is definitely their make or break year. If 2K22 is trash we gotta make a petition for a new studio to make a basketball game, there’s gotta be some studio out there that can do it. To be frank, I’m sick of 2K. They just do what the typical business does to its consumers, empty promises, fake financial trouble, rumors about overworked staff and understaff. Smh.
Why even Change ether game at all, just take 2k21 and cross out the 21 for 22.  Everyone would still buy it
I don’t know what y’all expect anymore I really don’t. In fact I’m surprised y’all ain’t got the picture that 2k ain’t finna change nothin. They just gon keep copying and pasting the same game and somehow people just keep givin them they’re money. 2k aint gon get better, they just wanna take yo money. Come on now stop being fooled.
Y’all need to stop buying the game
I’ve bought 2k every year except last year I hope the series gets better
Only getting it because I’m a mavs fan
🐐🐐
agents sick voice hit different😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
AGENT GO BUY VAPOR RUB AND PUT IT ON YOUR CHEST. THANK ME LATER
When the game is cracked I'm posting the pirate link.
Don’t buy the game. It’s 50/50. Community keeps buying it. They keep releasing a pay to win rng animation based trash ass game. If you get hype over anything with no gameplay then I don’t know bruh.
PC is still old gen F*** you 2k eat me.
Did you loose your voice twin?
2k21 my last 2k for a while
“No we didn’t do this simple feature but MYTEAM CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT” another way of saying “we only worried ab the modes that make us money as usual”
If we all moved to PC then we could have hundreds of custom courts, no more paying for VC, community made clothes, better servers, custom animations, everything would 100% be our choice.
2k21... pretty much just dropped... and now people are already expecting more from 2k people forget fast
I dont care about the graphic but if they dont have the same features on curent gen like on next gen and have the same game as was 2k20 and 2k21 that is just trash. I play on pc and we dont have the same my league like in next gen on ps5 on 2k21
I think agent just wants to hate on 2k at this point
Still not buying it 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Keep in mind 2k21 current gen has been on game pass for the past few months, that definitely led to sales
𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗘 𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞 𝗧𝗢 𝗧𝗛𝗜𝗦 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧 𝗪𝗛𝗘𝗡 𝗡𝗕𝗔𝟮𝗞𝟮𝟮 𝗜𝗦 𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗦𝗛
no hopes.
Imma watch yall play it before i buy it this time
They just want that $$
So we gon sit here and accept dirk sayin he don’t know KD or Kareem 😐
I bought both versions  (old and next gen) when they came on a major sale, but I only play career. I stopped playing park this year after the builds were the same every game.
I feel like they balance the game so half of it is arcady like contact animations then I have a wide open corner three with Clay and it’ll brick 15 times out of 15… it’s just frustrating and I wish they could just be held accountable
2K is too big too fail rn so they don’t give shit sadly 😂
Well I guess no 2k this year
Agent lost weight… lookin good
if they created a demo we'd just be disappointed sooner
are we gonna speak on myteam? i think its better then my career  , neighborhood tbh
Watch my - Lebron James MIXTAPE [ NBA2k14 vs NBA2k20 ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u6lP4ta2Oc
ewwww... twitter light mode. dark mode is the move lol
Legend edition should have been lebron Kobe Jordan
I bought 2k21 for 10 dollars ima wait till they slide me 22 for the low price
Hahaha lmao hahaha 2k down bad
Amp house is 🔥
Why don’t they just make a cross play version of 2k if they want the money that bad Im pretty sure we’re willing to pay for it
For all you guys that don’t know what to play anymore try Basketrio on mobile it has high potential
NGL to y'all boys bro if both games drop on the 10th then Current gen (PS4 version) is copy paste lol which makes since cause why waste money and Time on Making a game for a old console  lol
No fuck this Not buying this Game this year im just playing rocket league and dead by daylight
What I’m upset is cross next Gen play. I got ps5 so I need the Ng digital edition to play with some of my friends on ps4. Why can’t I buy the standard edition of ps5 to play with my friends on ps4 the standard edition. 2K just ripping people off.
Should I get basic 2k22 or legendary edition? What y’all think?
It’s not even worth playing anymore
Of course reddit wants a white player the platform is 99% white. 😴
I hope my shot or the parks/rec be glitchy
COVID
Another L type of game this year 🤦‍♂️💁‍♂️
Now Agent i know you know 2k will have the same park for at least 4 years 😂😂😂 2k heads down bad shouldn’t be no hype
Gotta ask yourself as consumers: is it the consumers or the company thats stupid as hell for steady buying the same game year after year. It’s our fault. Stop giving them your money until they’ve shown you they changed 🤷🏿‍♂️
I gave up on 2k:(
Who else was waiting to see a AMP member walk past his room.
Question. If I’m on PS5, does that mean I can run park with my friends on PS4 or nah?
anybody’s pack market not working ?
Agent i hope you get well soon
Agent you lost weight we need to go shopping to get shirts thwt fit
please don’t buy the game they try us like this because they know people going to buy if we come together is community a lot will change
Wassup I think 2k needs to start listening to you
God Loves You Know That ❤️🙏🏾✝️
Keep in mind that 2k21 was free on epic for like a week
Luka should not be on the cover
2k stay be doing this, making the trailers look high quality ah, but in reality it’s anything but high quality
I deadass thought I was the only one that felt like this game was gone be the same just from today
I just want an online blacktop game mode on the Home Screen
only in 2k can you pre order a "new" game and not see a lick of gameplay or modes
They could put sunset rivet and old town at least like they have it in the files all they gotta do is make it look nicer and people will be happy I know i would be
And y’all still gonna play it…sad
you’re surprised about this??
😂😂
I just want create a legend to comeback man
Because they focus on the WNBA right now play that feature more u see
Yo agent, love the vid. But i have something to comment about. when those Content creators posted the "anyone, anywhere can be the nba 2k 22 cover star" could this mean that a random person that plays 2k could be on a custom 2k cover?
Bra nobody wants the city bra I shouldn’t have to travel 32 hours to go to another park
I KNOW y'all ain't surprised
Next gen drops same day
Wait there is cross play
I think I’m gonna wait and see how the game is before I buy.
Hopefully, They fix NBA 2K22 Next gen on the series X as 2k21 was crashing shutting down consoles and no one was really trying to hear it. Launch everything was cool but it was like a few patches after something went wrong and and this within the early part of 2k21 next gen release
For us baguette croissant people, will the cover be different ?
who else been sick these past 2 weeks?
the game selling well because we getting older and gettin more bread
Yeah I hate people who ask for old shit like they’re gonna ask for jet packs or tigers but if they bring it back people will still complain that the rewards aren’t new
Your content is trash
I just want old meter I feel like the old meter gave me more whites
2k sucks
I wonder if they do make current gen different from next gen then will pc be the same as next gen or current
Mate 2k covers are so so so so much better than Fifa and the whole game is generally better !
Can we play have mycareer be online multiplayer, for example play other people in mycareer games
2K spends more money on cover athletes than their servers
fuck your clickbaiting title, report inc
Why does 21 look like 20? Why does 20 look like 19? Why does 19 look like 18? Why does 18 look like 17? Why does 17 look like16? Why do we keep buying the same game every year?
If they sold that many copies then the world going end in a few years🤦🏽‍♂️
Will they place an area in the park where new players can play? Cause right now off bat your a  "Random" and no one want to play.
One good thing I will say. This is the first 2k since 2k16 without a demo that won't come out in the first week of September
I said the exact same thing
Lmao Dirk what are Chad
2k hasn't been good since 2k17, I hope to good Nba live as some revolutionary shit so 2k can make a good game again.
Until the 2k community STOPS BUYING THE GAME, nothing will happen
Y’all gotta relise that 2k 22 will probably be a playable version of 21 then using the same city might be a good thing since they’ll focus on gameplay and not an overly large park
Probably not even going to buy this game.. will be sad when 2k20 servers are off
2k21 is the worst game ive ever played (next gen) they need to take the ai's out of the rec they ruined the rec
Same sh different day with 2k tell me something new
Lol I’ll prolly wait for it to be free again on epic or something.
Who else broke asf and want the game?
Make or break year. Done with 2k if it ain’t good!
U suckas who buy a new loading screen for 60$ each year blow my mind
I don't mind anything but change back the damn shot meter that meter pissed me off so much i stopped playing 21 altogether
All the versions will be released on September 10
I think it's stupid how a big majority of ya'll make the excuse that. "2K doesn't have any competition in the basketball genre, which is why I buy it every year." Which is bs. Stop making that excuse to continue to support these lazy devs.
W Agent
I have no hope for 2k22 ngl🤦🏾 but W video agent🔥
These titles are trash, you don’t have to clickbait when you already have this big of following
can we all just please switch to ea if they drop a game im so tired of 2k bro
Still gone be trash
How do it look like nba 2k21 ? why do y’all always complain about the game 🤦🏽‍♂️ and its the same game y’all can’t even develop y’all self. give them a break, the only way for a game like 2k to be how y’all want it… u will need a real nba player and street ball player to give precise detail to developers from what they experienced or done in a real game or pick up game
I’m excited for 22, feeling good ab it 🔥
cross platform not cross play
It’s crazy that even for 2k23 more people are still gonna be playing on last gen.  Covid really messed up this gen.
i just hope the pc port of the game is the next gen version of the game and not the current gen
There get paided millions with the amount of vc people buy,    Vc is way to expensive and something needs to change because the game has been trash
Why'd he say next gen has been out for years, hasn't even been 1 year
Why a grown man is still complaining about a game😶‍🌫️
12:00 “Ronnie has capped many of times”   “That’s not the neighborhood guys I don’t know what your talking about”
stop buying VC..... ah... useless
Madden is unbearable Cod sucks especially for ppl who don't like first person for fornite is lame. 2k is all we got.
They put a white dude on there with the USA color scheme... 😆
They should make an official 2k game without a number, that updates maps and does significant things like Fortnite does.. Simple, they should team with Epic to better the servers
Agent I need your help please help us get anti cheat for 2k22 pc
I think if ea would have kept on producing nba live they could have really been up to par with 2k. All they needed to do was produce more content and improve their modes.
The ppl still trying to get a PS5 and the NEW 2k coming out PAIN‼️
THIS IS A MAKE OR BREAK YEAR FOR 2K
We just need 2k to put some effort into It I would love to play something that i could tell people worked on and care about.
Legend edition needs to come with enough vc to get the my players to the cap. 100k isn't it
No one cares for 2k22 anymore this shit is horrible
POV: u already heard a lot this stuff from the mo cap dude from tiktok
Honest answer: why would they change it when they KNOW people will continue to buy it regardless? The consumers   are the ones that have to put  the pressure on 2K to actually improve
I hope it makes that amazing turn and creates another game but better than 2k17 & 16
Did your golf shoes arrive?
No hate to KD but why is he on a legends cover?
sounds like 2k18 agent lol
yall are actually suprised. these games have been the same for like 5 years
Vibration in 22?
Idk what the point of emphasis is with the game.
Because we buy it 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
NBA 2k22 will be the same on next gen because not many people have a next gen console. Current Gen will get heavy love this year.
Because video games are just copy and paste now
Bro they just need to make a draft mode like they have in madden that would be so fun
I don’t want that shit to be fake agent! Know basketball, it’s not fun to see spam dribbles and greens everywhere
2K isn't about making the game realistic. The Park is one step away from being NBA Jam lol
they should just hire agent...
Please stop buying 2K they will keep pumping out trash if you keep buying it
You didn't see 2k22 but you're probably right. Btw I'm sort of impress graphicly how some good some players look in nba2k21 next gen version but still a lot of elements like dancing girls or crowd looks totally past gen! Tell me when we gonna get separate full next gen version!???? 2k23 ? Or maybe 2k25?:)
Cause Ronnie and the devs dont care about changing the game they spend there time on Twitter dancing
2k22 is a girl
2k sales 📉
So ehh gameplay going down and getting dunked on by a 6 1 guard it's dunkfest not 2k wtf
AMP MEMBERS BEEN REAL CONSISTENT LATELY TOGETHER AN ON THEIR SOLO CHANNELS 🔥🔥
I’m gonna cry
Why does the 2k community act like 70$ is a lot when y’all just end up buying the most expensive edition of 2k anyways💀
The fact that Agent said that 2k is getting too realistic shows how out of touch he’s getting with the game
I remember when they first showed 2k21 on next gen, I was telling everybody that they’ve been using the same engine since 2k18 & everyone was saying I was expecting too much of them, or I needed to stop bitching and make my own bball game. Like bro we jumped a whole generation while they’re using a 4 year old engine, and I’m expecting too much of them? Seriously? Smh
look like a little kid been hanging on this mans collar.
You would think with 2k making billions every year their game would be flawless. Too bad they don’t want to hire more employees or game testers who know what they’re doing. Sad.
U know why!! They copy and paste every year!
Will the pc version be next Gen or old generation
Cause you kids still going to buy the shit no matter how it looks or plays so you can play Barbie dress up with ya myplayer 🤣😂🤣
Y’all keep buying it.
still no Portuguese version
current gen and last gen drop on september 10th. both of them do.
Here we go again... 2K feeds y'all a little BS and y'all fall right for it. Y'all just itching to give 2K all y'all money huh?🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ Let me guess... Y'all think this year 2K is finally gonna "fix the game" right? Men all y'all should be ashamed. 2K laughing at y'all for believing they gonna fix the game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let’s all just not buy the game this year and see what happens 😂
This man sick of 2k
i still never will understand why agent says 19 is better than 17😂😂 it’s not even close is the fun aspect. games being fun is all the matters. if a games bad but it’s fun it’s good.
Simple answer... because y'all keep buying it so they have zero incentive for any significant improvements at this point
2k22 next gen better release in September, no way it better be all the way in November, I swear lol!
Same reason 2k21 looks like 2k20...and 2k20 looks like 19 lol
Now all they gotta do is drop ps5 prices
wait why is 2k22 coming out so close to 2k21 ? it feels like 2k21 was really shott
R.I.P nba2k and HELLO wwe2k
I hope nba2k22 removes the rep system to wear certain items just keep it like 2k19 your a 93 you get no shirt but on 2k20-21 your a 93 allstar 1 you get nth
At this point, I am convinced that the fanboys love getting bumfucked by EA.
i gave up on playing 2k consistently after 18 dropped and im glad i did.
Ah, more elite 2k content  I have 0 hype or expectations for this game, so if it’s trash I won’t be disappointed and if it’s good I’ll have the time of my life
Why cant they just combine 2k20 mechanics with 2k21 graphics? it would be perfect
It’s a yearly release yall expect AAA development for 2k stop this unrealistic hope they don’t have more than 8 months to work on it yall complain about a game that has done everything possible it can’t do more than what it already has
I love how everyone hates on this game, yet they  buy it hoping it will be different 😂
Any news if the PC version will be current gen or next gen?
I somewhat agree with agent about the realism part. But that how games are going. more realistic. However, 2k isn’t realistic in the slightest. Constant contact dunks, people spamming one dribble move to trigger an animation, 100% contests constantly going in, or playing good defense and somehow they consistently make shots. I could on and on about how 2k is the furthest thing from realistic. I get it it’s a game but there are a lot and I mean a lot of problems that would even make it remotely fun.
No lie 2k22 is my year hitting legend 💯💯
Playing 2k is like being a browns fan.
this is the only time i hear a youtuber say “my voice sounds a little different cause im sick” and i actually hear a difference
People need to stop buying 2K so 2K for once can actually improve their game.
I hate the city dude. Just make it so I can join a party with my friends and we can matchmake and play without the headache of trying to join friends and then get a game.
Sooo dirk doesn’t know kevin durant or kareem wow, ratio
Why would 2k22 Next gen come out a month or 2 after current Gen? I can see why it did last year because had to wait for the consoles to drop, this year however I can’t see why they not dropped same day
how they want us to pre order with no gameplay😐
Agent in the PS5 store it says 9/9/21
Y'all gone still buy anyways. 😂
First 2k I won't be buying
2K22 to 2K21 is what 2K20 was to 2K19.
ratio fat
Not excited at all, but still watching agent
What i think they should do is add a mode where you have historical games from past till now & you can unlock teams i think that’ll be something new that we didn’t have before
You lame you haven’t even seen 2k22 so how tf you kno smh put this title up for views lame guy
So is cross-gen happening? Can i play park with my buddy on next gen if I have current gen?
I'll take a real basketball game over a fun game with dudes wearing backpacks,wigs,and timbs killing in hoops I'm a MyLeague guy anyways
NBA 2K will always shine 🍾. Everyone who loves basketball 🏀 will purchase 2K.
2k is dead
U haven’t even played the game smh
They sold 8 million units but literally sold the same game twice.
22 next gen has the same engine as Curret gen 21 GG RIP 2K
They should’ve had Kobe instead of KD on the legends cover next to Dirk
shouldve put vince on the cover to
STOP BUYING 2K GAMES! We complain every year about how the game gets worse and worse yet they still sell millions! No wonder they're not changing the games, because we keep buying it!!! Boycott the game before its out please!
How are we gonna ignore a demo may or may not come? A demo is so important
2K really needs to look at how other games work… I got bored simply because there isn’t a queue system other than proam 3s and 5s. Make the stage a queue system and make a proper ranking system, make people play people in their ranks so that they don’t run away from games etc. Not losing rep is dead af and makes the grind even worse, being SS1 and barely making any progression sucks, imagine being elite 3 lmao
Time for boycotting!
Why is Durant on a cover w..nvm bro
Don’t expect nothing new to the game if they make one every year To make a good game you need time
The funniest thing is, people getting still hyped over NBA 2k same goes with the EA games. Its still the same as always. I think we should go to the HQ of 2k and EA and shit on the cars and tables, maybe they understand we are pissed.
So is PC gonna have a next gen game yet???
I stuck with how this works. Does the cross platform version mean that I can play current gen and next get on my current gen consle
Reddit does not. You gotta be blind to not see that coming
Because it is nba 2k21 but with a updated logo
is he talkin' about next gen 2k21? I don't think i've ever heard anybody describe that game as "too sim". Everybody can shoot threes and contact dunk every play....
It could be cross play, but Sony is charging for that, and if I have a multi million, close to billion dollar game already, I’m not paying you just to get cross play when I’m make $, the other games got it because they were free to play/just paid the money
Wait…     Kareem is still alive😭
Do you not see msm blaming Reddit for certain stock being the price it is lmao 😂😂😂
PIN THIS: Ever since they added 95-99 system 2k hasn’t been the same..
Why are the rewards the same as 18, 19, 20 ,21!?! (Correct me if I’m wrong)
Big disagree that their moving towards realism and removing fun as a result. Live 19 is more realistic than 2k21.. if anything it's too arcade. People literally stumbling across the court after being crossed several times a game.. contact dunks are outta control.. curry slides and similar cheese and inability to move well on defense at all.. inconsistent coverage results on contests.. select builds/positions op and rarely or never patched. Animation locks on moves like dunk anis are silly. Saving the ball going out of bounds having no good animations at all. Player controlled characters not responding to lose balls near them. There are so many silly or cheesy aspects to the game it's ridiculous. The takeover system itself encourages arcade play. Rather than minor boosts to attribs it makes u a God assuming you have a decent one equipped. We need more realism and freedom of movement with less Ani locks and cheesy takeovers and shit. Not more
Nah 2k21 was not realistic. I remember when people could get team takeover off one possession. A flashy pass into fadeaway, fadeaway 3s and consistent contacts dunks. There was like only on archetype this year and it was the 6'7 PF. Barely any centers this year. Defense was lacking. Just absolute trash.
I’m putting my foot down I’m not buying 2k this year
City is garbage. 😡
Have fun on curry slide 2k22
Agent bruh will I’ll be able to shot,that’s all I want to do is be able to shot not even three just a midrange jumper and little bit of stamina and speed.
All they do is drop sky angles and different lighting of the playground 😂😂😂😂😂
The question should be “Why do you dummies keep buying a shit game”
Well.. I just got click baited
The choppyness on launch has to be fixed
Bro I've stopped buying 2k after I realized how shit 2k18 was. Best decision of my life, I get my 2k fix through u agent lol, my life is better bcuz of it
i think the sales numbers are deceiving, the game was heavily discounted around christmas and the game was free for a short period of time on pc also it has been on xbox game pass for months. but idk if they're only counting actual purchases or just downloads
I'm telling everyone don't pre-order the game without knowing if 2k22 is good or not that why I don't have 2k21
no faith in this company, esp after their greatest zoom call of all time
So does that mean his player type is going to be the dominant one?
Stop buy the game every godamn years!!!!
No demo? Wtf I’m not paying $70 without getting a chance to see how it feels before hand. Fuck that shit
U said we've been in next  gen for a couple years now. No it hasn't been a year yet....
imma be honest, a lot of ppl don’t buy 2k bc there’s no cross-play
Didn’t they realize dropping 2 games divided the community and killed the park.
I already said I’m not pre ordering the game this year I’m gonna buy it a couple weeks after the release to see if there’s any improvements now it’s looking like I’m not buying this bs
I’m just waiting to see fanum walk pass in the background with food in his hand 😂😂😂
Why would next gen drop later?
Current and next gen drop on the same day. I checked on the Microsoft store
They're going to cut and paste the game again and charge 100$ for it again. AGAIN. Anyone who buys this at this point is a chump man. They are stealing your money bros. The only way to make them evolve is to STOP paying for this shitty cut and paste garbage.
This is what we should DO NOT PRE ODER IT WAIT TILL THE GAME COMES OUT TO SEE IF IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I WASTED MINE
Low standards for it, have them backup games ready.
2k is the best sports game we have at this point.Madden sucks, Fifa is just ok, and the Show is kinda fun
Dirk got on the cover and he chose violence
F nba2k
I really don’t understand why 2k doesn’t actually listen. Because he made some really really really REALLY good points about this game and 2k just doesn’t care. That’s just bad promoting on 2k’s part and then everybody else buying this game, if y’all want the game to be made how you want, STOP BUYING THE GAME!! MAKE them make the game fun again. Because at this point, it’s only about money. Smh
9:08 they took the affiliations out way too soon and didn’t even try to make it better
Drop Pro Am and bring back Crew like 2k11
if its the same shit as 2k21 not buying this trash.
All I want back from 2k is the crib! Maybe have in incorporated with ur my player or u as a gm I’m my league
BOYCOTT2K22
2k is trash
They should look to turn the game into a F2P live service, similar to something like league of legends. The VC shop is no different from any mobile games marketplace. People already buy a buncha VC, and if the game was F2P, more people would play and more people would buy VC. Games like League make soooo much money and the main thing people spend money on are purely cosmetic, though you can also buy the characters with the currency as well. Perhaps you can even charge like $20 (probably would be pushed up to $40 at least) a year to get updated local game modes like My GM and quick play.   I truly believe the game would be better received and make a similar amount of money, if not more than it already does, just since more people would play. Devs could then focus more on consistent gameplay improvements that arent influenced by the deadline to release a new game every year. I believe the competitive scene would flourish under such a system and take a big step as far as viewership goes.   I think this would be a genius move for them, and should look to move into a new format that isnt from the stone age like releasing a new game every year with expected improvements on gameplay.
Now that the show is on xbox im done with 2k. They had me since 2k3 and im finally just done with it
I’m so pissed Booker didn’t get the cover. Motivating all the suns to get a chip and gettin to the finals and he don’t get it. A orange and purple cover would go so hard too 😩
T.T. (taketwo) is like the "presidents of the world" ya know 👀
Looks like shit
How are they going to get cross gen to work when I can't even join west/east parks on next gen without lagging out. I live in Dubai and almost a year later I still can't join my homie park.
The 2k community: fix speed glitches and contact dunks 2k devs: you wanted a WNBA mycareer mode?
2k is selling because it’s the only real basketball game we love basketball idk what people expected.
I can get over the same parks at the start as long as the gameplay is good !!!!!
Agent been partying fr
Ahhhh this new change of scenery is refreshing 😃 AMP on top ‼️
And we here again
Agent you should join ronnies discord server
I knew this video was coming lmao
This year I’m not going to buy 2k, this current year I bought both version and are trash 🗑
Cross Play would explode 2K’s servers.
BRUH DONT BUY THE GAME UNTIL THEY GIVE US A GOOD PRODUCT
2k killed Gman smh
They can miss we’re just loyal
Let's say I wanted to buy the legend edition on PS5. But i don't want to pre-order the game so I wait until the games offical release date (which is September 10th) do I still get the bonuses that come with the game. Or can I only get the bounses if I pre-order. I want the legend edition because i don't have money to spend $100 on a game and than spend another $100 on VC. I want the 100k VC that comes with it. I don't want to spend $100 on a game and get nothing from it because I didn't pre-order the legend edition prior.
Why does the 2k community complain about 2k looking the same then buy the preorder and complain when its trash? Then the same thing over and over. Its like when madden started doing this now look at madden lol. First it was bc "they were working on the next gen 2k" I wonder what the excuse is this year.
I stopped playing and don’t plan on playing anytime soon
I'll beat up agent 00
This there last chance with me. I never cared with being disappointed by the games releasing the past 3 years but 2k21 is where I draw the line. I bought current gen then brought a ps5 then had to pay another $70 for next gen to not even play that shit. I won’t even jump to buy on release if I hear the game is ass after a month I’m just done with 2k.
$70 scam!
did they change tho?
How sway.
Let's be real good or bad, everyone is going to buy the game...
why cant pc get next get as well???
Not doing it I’m not preordering shit I’m tired of being burned fuck that game
Left this game a couple of years ago. Best decision ever 😂
#waitfor2ksale
Yo your a big YouTuber stop mentioning this garbage game then maybe less people will buy it
2K scams y’all every year and y’all still fall for it. They got the real Jwett😂💪🏾
Make or break? Yeah right lol what else are we gonna play? I think they know that
I bought 2k21 mamba edition and I never got my 100k vc for next gen bc I never got a next generation console can I get that bc in 2k22?? Anyone know ?
Cross progression across consoles for MyPlayer isn't that hard!!! Another year of having to pick which console you won't be playing 🥴
Wait is the Luka and legends thing different  games
Another trash game
Wait, why the hell would they release next gen differently than current gen?
Craziest part is every Long Beach California kid or teenager using mommy’s money  is still gotta get it and rip packs from the jump on myteam
Replace Candace Parker with tea cooper and we got one of the best covers
This is why I don't play more than a month after release. Just boring same old shit
Clickbait 😂
They can keep releasing dumb shit because 14 million idiots will buy it
Clickbait Thumbnail…DISLIKE!
Come to PlayStation this year agent you’ll have better comp
clickbaitin man
@Agent Tencent do not own Take Two at this time. So you saying 2k is owned by tencent is not true for the time being lol
Yall say this shit every year but end up making gameplay videos 😭😭 2k community a joke now istg
Lol fam what year u in? Next gen been here for 1 yr exactly in November 😂😂
Daddy
2k game model of releasing a bad game then making a slightly better and sometimes worse game the next year
Pc getting shafted again. It sucks
At this point, we almost expect the game to be mid at best. SAD
They should make a  city like  2k19 again I’m not trying to go all around that big ass city again omg it’s so annoying I don’t need all that 2k19 online was perfect
Sick agent sounds like a mix of Davis and agent
Nice click bait agent
Same servers and  same animations! Straight ass
Finally agent posted
4:09 Legend edition my a** I didn't get any of those insensitives that are included in the Leged edition of Nba2k21..🤦‍♂️😐
The release date wouldn’t be different for current and next Gen bc next Gen is already out
I just play myteam at this point bro 😂 didn't even make it past pro this year on park smh
Once y’all stop playing 2K, Madden, and Fortnite I swear your mental and spiritual health will improve so much.
Im not surprised they put barley any work in
Covers mean nothing if the game is trash
I wonder who’s gonna get the 😂Candiice parkerr cover unless it’s cheaper😂😂😂
Idk game might be trash again but Luka looking nice no homo
Bruh
Agent click baited
Yo
I Feel So Bad For People Who Like This Game And Try To Defend This Garbage Game ..2k Is Gunna Drop A Unfinished, Boring ,lack luster Game And Rob Yall Again .. Then Their Gunna Make It So Hard To Get Vc Naturally So It Incentivizes You To Spend Another 70$ On My Career..Then The're Gunna Wipe Y'all Tears With The Millions Of Dollars ( After Yall Start Complaining) There Gunna Make From The Garbage Game That Yall Spent 140$ On .. Lmaoo ..Yall Want Change? Stop Buying And Playing This Stupid Game That Is Only Created To Make Money ..2K Does Not Care About Yall ...They Only Care About Yall Wallets ..
Past 2ks are the best bring back as much past shit as possible!!
Because they clearly don't care about the fans lol
It does suck that everyone’s bar on the game is so low and yet it makes billions
5:10 correction, 2k is owned by Take two, nott tencent, Take two isn't Chinese either
Yo agent in the video where luka  is doing the mocap the director of the dev team said that In 2k22 you and donic will interact in the city
You actually sound better. Stay sick.
2k you-tubers are just as much to blame as 2k developers on why 2k is ass.
wtf is that beeping in the background
It's a small thing, but I just want them to update the damn shoes. Sure, let's show the Why Not 0.4 as the shoe icon for Jordan brand shoes, and then NOT have it as a shoe you can give your player. Or the fact that they haven't added stuff like the past 2 Lebron models. How hard is it to keep up with the shoes at the very least.
This gonna be the 1st time I don’t preorder 2K. It’s sad but needed, they will continue to half ass this game & future releases if they keep getting our $$$. There’s way better games than 2K I barely play 21 anymore anyways.
No Crossplay and last gen pc port . Hope this company goes under and everyone loses their job
Surprised Kai didn’t walk in on the video lol
Why keep playing this game ……..
can my comment get pinned 🙂
Is 2k22 playable on current gen?
Surprise surprise you're complaining already
When you said looks exactly the same I thought you meant like fades are hella OP again
Until It’s in my Xbox series X or PS five I can’t say it nothing the cover means crap to me I ain’t bought a disk of any media in 4 years
I don't see the point of the title. We haven't even seen the game yet
So no servers for South Africa
No Cross Play could be one of the biggest L's of the millennium but it's 2k we're talkin bout so they are used to the L lifestyle. They also overcharge for their shitty games so even if it does cost them money the $70 pricetag would be warranted.
As Agent said ("This is a make or break year for for 2k") and that's a fact if this game flops it's GG
If you pre-order this you dumb lol
I don’t mind seeing as no one acc played this 2k seeing how shit it was
Wait so is the legend edition have both gens in that pre order?
Just so you know, both versions of the game release on September 10th
I’m not buying it
What is this dumb video for. Watched the whole thing for 0 information just you repeating the same sht you say every year. Not watching no more of your videos bro. Good luck
Doris Burke should have been the first female cover athlete
Why does the teaser sound like Westbrook more?
I’m just going to wait a month before I buy next gen 2k this time. It was too disappointing last year.
Cant believe i can actually see your kneck lol GOOD SHIT KEEP IT UP
9:06 fr Agent these dudes don’t understand
Mycareer and proam should be simulation. Park and my team arcade. Rec should be a some where in the middle. Not too over the top not too boring and slow.
Oh so no one notice it's been the same game since 2k18, just new cover art.... or was it just me🙁.
No demo sounds like, "we want you to buy a shit, half-made game without playing it first."
I need help subscribe to me
Even tho I know it won't happen, I'm really hoping EA drops Live 22 at EA Play on July 22nd
25 years of losing money WNBA getting old
Pre L 2K
I want to pre order but I’m worried
You now the day is good when agent or anyone in AMP uploads
I swear man, Madden people hate EA so much they want 2K to take over football games. 2k players want EA to take over basketball games. But both are trash and I don't see it getting better anytime soon smh
What 8 million people bought 21 I didn’t
Dont support sports games
Graphics could be better. I wish 2k had graphics like mortal kombat and justice league. That's how ik 2k could look 10x better. If only they had a new engine.
Uo
I wonder who’s gonna get the Candice parker cover unless it’s cheaper
i wanna to be able to play with my ps4 friends when i’m on xbox
So make everyone waste time on not so good builds to redo them with no demo
Amp house Agent
ofc it looks the same, they copy pasted the file and then renamed it 😂😂
Where are you getting your information from agent used to be good at this there's going to be cross play in the game have you been to the 2K website have you talked to Mike Wayne come on agent you slipping
It’ll be 2K 21.5
Agent still goated
You sound sick
Lol give it up 2k is done
First daddy agent
If you try and pre order the ps5 version of nba 2k22 at Best Buy and GameStop they say the release date is also September 10th. Maybe they actually are gonna drop both gen versions on the same day
Ctrl c + ctrl v and one minor change
Thats trash give me playstation kids i can drop off
WAGENT
Man we like agents video
iPhone: *sells the same products each year* 2k devs: Well you know what they say. New year, same me am I right!
The only thing is going to be new in 2K is cross-gen that's it
😢😢😢
I mean... yall still are going to buy it so...
IF YOU READ THIS DO NOT BUY 2k22!!! FORCE THEM TO MAKE THE GAME BETTER!!!
hi
Fuck 2k
1:55 if you pause here, you can tell kareem was an all state speller
2k is done
You sleep on reddit lol. Its like the black market for info.
Great video bro even though your sick I appreciate the content !!!!🔥
L
sportsfans are easy prey
the candace parker cover is the gamestop exclusive
they put more effort into advertising the game than actually improving it
I was here before power got put in the description
How come everytime I don’t buy a 2k when it first drops it actually turns out to be a good game, this year I’m going to wait 2 months and then buy it, I really miss 2k being fun💯
No prelude?
Yall know the only way to get them to actually try is to stop buying their shit. Yall just askin for garbage
First
“Why does 2k22 look exactly like 2k18?” Fixed that title for you
How do they keep downgrading every year
Fuck 2k I need a ps4
75years worth of basketball to pull data from and 2K still chooses to put a emphasis on arcade type modes
Because all of you retards keep buying the game. At a certain point its a fans responsibility to hold the game developers accountable for putting out the same shit. DON'T BUY THE GAME.
I don't even plan on buying 2k22 but I'd never miss an agent video even if I never play 2k ever again.
Bruh and I just pre-ordered it😔 I should have waited🤦🏾‍♂️
its ronnie, nothing new
I’ll personally murder every person who likes this comment
Damn
Who gives af waste of time game will be trash won’t even buy done with 2k till it’s good
damn
Cause it's always the same game. Happy i didn't buy 2k21 and I'm not buying 2k22. They won't understand until you start talking with your wallets
W agent room
This was clickbate wtf
Imma just buy nba live...
Y’all know damn well when 2K add a certain park they rehash it for the next 3/4 years, shi gonna be trash😭
Lmaoo 2k the only game I know that can get worse over time
im gonna go off and say every time they put a guard on the cover that shit is probably gonna be ass
They should make the WNBA edition like a separate park for females to kinda get things started before mixing girls Nd guys in the same park
No one should even be surprised atp bro...
We always take breathing clearly for granted 😔. Thank your clear nose today 🙏
Stop buying the games and they might actually start improving the game.
I mean we aren’t surprised
Praying that 2k22 is one of, or the best 2k ever. I’m sick of the mediocrity 2k settles with ever year. I want to have fun playing 2k again, I want to play into the night with my friends having a good time again. If this 2k is trash it’s the last one I’m ever playing. I hope we receive greatness but knowing 2k we’re probably getting the opposite.
I'm glad I stop buying 2k after 16.  I saved myself all the complaining and money
the seventy firth edition 🙏🏿
Who tf is gonna buy wnba🤣🤣
I have that same Toronto hat
You the only one I enjoy listening to talking about 2k
i don’t understand why everyone says every 2k looks the same when they literally don’t lmfao people just like to cry and run with shit other people say now it’s too funny
Honestly I feel like 2K15 and 2K16 had more realistic graphics which to me look better. The cartoon style that I feel like they’ve leaned more into kinda takes away from the simulation and realism. Mods have been able to add some filters to the game but that should be exclusive to pc users and should be standard in the game FOR EVERYONE.
The nba 2k formula can be represented by ,   NBA 2K (Year) + Extra Sweat = NBA 2K of the next year
NOTI GANG GANG GANG GANG GAAAANG
Post notification gangk ?
I swear bro, if EA just use this opportunity to make a new great basketball game, they will make absolute BANK
My guy yu look young asf
Which one is current and next gen?
We need team celebrations during the game in the park, pro-am, etc
Exactly what i been saying. The replication is coming for both gen 8 & 9. This is all done from last year work to leverage out time actually for them to build for 2k23.  2k22 was a cheat code input in this context to reuse 2k21 only as an apology of some sort by excuse of the pandemic which the vast majority aren't buying what they're selling
Agent drop the AMP merch and drop a channel that you talk bout financial stuff like the peertopeer podcast but not a podcast
Bruh idc y’all bet not preorder this shit till we see they actually made some fuckin changes.
Yur
Yall youngbloods always getting so technical with video games nowadays just have fun like bird in '81
I pre ordered the 75th edition not knowing how the game will be🙄
Creators stopped giving a shii about their game watch gta 6 be like vice city could be wrong
You sick bro?! Yea you're sick bro!
2k will never change🤦🏾‍♂️
Man Agent speaking faxs
What up agent
Because its 2k? Why else
Next generation duh 🙄
This game is 2k20.2, they have no intention of doing anything innovative. It's still going to sell like crazy.
Yoo

Noti gang wya
I wish we'd all collectively cancel 2k this year
Last
Better question: why do people still play 2k? 🤔
They can keep the city but the gameplay needs to be amazing and the rep rewards better be amazing and the servers better be clean or else ima go goo goo ga ga mode🍼🍼🍼
I’m gay😁
Bro your video quality is super crispy. I gotta know what camera and lens you use.
We hope agent comes back in 2k22 🙏🏽
I swear YouTube has dislike bots 2 noti haters????
Yurrr
We bout to have the same neighborhood all over again like 20
Yessirrrrr Agent
2k hasn’t been good since 2k19😔
Plus they’re giving a free skateboard in the 75th anniversary edition so that confirms the horrible City we all hate is coming back
everyone is first until they reload the page☹️
you’re lying right… right?
Fuck 2k
Hi been a while dad 😘
Noti gang was here ⬇️
I wonder how the game is going to play like hopefully there is defense
AGENT what’s up mane. How’s life we don’t see as much anymore on the OG channel.
🤦🏾‍♂️
Don't do dis to me
I've seen ppl start playing nba live 19 to not have to play 2k21
I can't wait for the day EA comes out of the water with a good basketball game and just takes it all away from 2K.
Bro who disliked y’all some haters he just posted
I ain’t even gonna get it, I’m done!
Sick Dean in the chat
I’m not surprised either agent, 2k has been copying and pasting for a minute now
2k doing the same thing as usual🤦🏾 I really thought this would be the change for 2k
How Steph still not have a nba2k cover bruh
