"Put me back in it" 🧠👅🫶🏻 Absolutely soul crushing words to wake the heart from it's icy slumber...
Vi um vídeo da Claudia e da Madeleine de IWTV com essa música e fiquei devastada, tive que vir escutar ela inteira
Quina cançó tan delicada i emotiva.... gràcies, sempre la recordaré. ❤😮😊
🤍
Do you write about about old acquaintance. Do you write about her life is it go late to go back to her she has to be worth going back to if you write all these songs about her. Who ever she is we need a new album pls and thank you! Eventually after you rest of course 🖤 hope to hear some new music from you in the future plss include Edm, AB when you decide to tour again ☀️🌙
Singing this to my cats.
this is my favorite song ever
Hozier babe you don't need autotune, as a matter of fact, autotune needs you!
Love your drummer and of course you 🙏🌻❤️❤️
Norwegian artist Øyvind Sørøy, aka ColonThree :3 , has brilliantly incorporated Francesca into a manga series he's currently making. The song runs through this full 4 mins anime (and you may check people's comments):   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nDpdDCTzH4
❤
Fanfic "The injury of finally knowing you" brought me here
I simply adore the comments section under this video.. some people are sharing their pain and others are anwering with love and support.. understanding each other without judging.  As if this song couldn't be even more beautiful, but people came together and did it 🥰 Thank you guys!
I weep. Bless hozier for saying it. Let's live life in love.
Saw this song live in new Orleans tonight it was soooo good
🖤
Hozier die hards leave the best comments
If I could listen to this song for a minute, I'd do it again.
That background male singer with the guitar is a gem 💎  Alex Ryan he is and God I'm in love ❤
No idea what any of the lyrics are but I'm loving the vibes
🐕‍🦺🌭
No regrets Jet.
Unending
This  song is clearly a MASTERPIECE,  and the beautiful soul who wrote it is a  human MASTERPIECE  as well.  He is unlike anyone else,  truly a musical genius of our time.  His lyrics are gut-wrenching  and passionate at the same time.  I wish I could tell Andrew  how very much I love  the music he is giving us. It brings such happiness to hear his voice and his songs  that make me appreciate this world more than ever. Such a beautiful soul he has. Bless you Andrew.
this is so tommy and franny coded
This song is written for Tommy and Franny <33
Did you write this about Franny and Tommy???
Melody and singing reminds me of Cocteau Twins
#BrasilDosBrasileiros
too quiet! If i can't hear you with the volume on my computer turned all the way up, yall need to fix your sound mixing
oh, Francesca
i love you gay jesus <3
Wow ! I'm surprise,this is very good ,why I don't hear this before ?
A voz do anjo
E essas batidas da bateria, ao final da música, reproduzindo as batidas do coração??!! 🇧🇷❤
Estou na situação inversa: moto no Brasil faz 15 anos e meu filho tem 11, mas sou só eu que falo inglês com ele, então já maioria das vezes, ele fala português comigo mesmo quando falo com ele em inglês.
No Soul tax.
We can't do it again.
I was suppose to see him perform this live yesterday but it bascially got rained out. 😭😭😭
2:29 I have that exact green dinosaur sitting on my shelf. It's pretty sticky but it glows in the dark
I think everyone here described perfectly what we feel when we listen to this song. But the video??? I mean its simple... the band playing and him singing... but to see them interact, each piece of the puzzle that is their artistry, specially in the outro, you get to see a glimpse of everyone's contribution to the song, and its the most beautiful and touching thing to witness.
I miss my girlfriend so much
Continuo ouvindo e ouvindo…  Como se ouvisse pela primeira vez.
The tragedy of Francesca, even though the Lord has condemned her to hell for her sins, she revolts with Love, and her soul sings if it asked she'd do it again 😢
💜💜💜💜
The entire song is a prayer, and the last bit is en escape to some other realm. I'm not bluffing or exaggerating when I say that the last part gives me goosebumps all over, and makes me feel all light! No matter how many times I hear it!!
Amooooooooo
💜💜feel like a spark went out a little when i drew the conclusion that i can't make it to concert alone.. can't believe i can't find anyone to go with me 😢
This song feels like dancing during a sun shower.
The most romantic song ever written. Devastating. Haunting.
Hozier, how do you sound so fresh and unique? i enjoy listening to his songs. I'm glad i found you keep being you people appreciate your art.
🔥🔥🔥
This is such a beautiful song. Something about it reminds me of 90s alternative rock, and I'm not sure what it is but I really like it.
Why am I reminded of Lucretia and Cesare Borgia whenever I listen to this song
I don't know who gave this man permission to wreck everybody, but he does it consistently, and no more so than in this ENTIRE album!
Definitely will be my 2025 ravorite song
Beautiful ❤️🌹 thank you!!

Your music is so powerful, poetic, a balm for my soul.🙏🌻
One of my favorite hozier song ❤

💜💜these are the best videos... Live, love you
Keep making good song, the world needs you hozier!
🤎🥀💔
Hozier não acerta uma...  Acerta todas
Every single time I listen to this song, the end give me the chills. It's truly so beautiful and haunting
Can’t get enough of this
This is my absolutely favorite song ever. So powerful, romantic, devastating, intense... It's the definition of a masterpiece. Sometimes I just know I'm not in the right piece of mind to listen to it haha, makes me feel such strong emotions it's not an everyday song!
Mii?! :((... ingerul meu scump si drag :((... te rog incearca :((...
I weep.
Maybe a new favorite and its in deselby. Bless you HOZIER. Yes. Much pain and I'd do it again.
I'm in my headphones right now and I JUST NOW heard the thunder during "my life was a storm"
This lives so strong and so gently in my mind much of the time 🖤 I love this song. It’s brilliant. This kind of love is like no other kind of love 🖤
"There is something that Dante does not say, but which one feels at  a distance from the episode and perhaps gives it its virtue. Dante relates  the fate of the two lovers with an infinite pity, and we sense that he  envies their fate. Paolo and Francesca are in Hell and he will be saved,  but they have loved and he never won the love of the woman he loved,  Beatrice. There is a certain injustice to this, and Dante must feel it as  something terrible, now that he is separated from her. In contrast, these  two sinners are together. They cannot speak to each other, they turn in  the black whirlwind without hope, yet they are together. When she  speaks, she says “we,” speaking for the two of them, another form of  being together. They are together for eternity; they share Hell and that,―   for Dante, must have been a kind of Paradise." -Borges
❤✨
Franseca we love you so sorry you suffered. Itaalian Irish
It's haunting and heartbreaking at the same time!
Só entendi a parte do "hahaha". Alguém mais?
❤❤
“With each grave. I think of loss and I can only think of you. I couldn’t measure it” eeeeeee the lyrics are heavy. I want to write about the weight of this record. Grounding. A Golden Lady for this record.
This song is like a parallel to the work song   “No grave can hold my body down”/“I tell them put me back in it”  Sometimes we ache to be imprisoned. Sometimes we’re too stunted to fail
ingerul meu scump si drag!:((.... unde esti? :((....
Mii?! :((...
the pub pretzels w/ honey maple mustard! So GOOD!!! 🫶
Mii?! :((... ingerul meu scump si drag! :((... incearca te rig :((... paraseste locul acela blestemat :((... cere-mi orice! :((... sunt aici! :((...

Noticed I had already given this a thumbs up when I just  checked this as I was listening to it. I know why because it blew me away and I had to see what it was called.
ingerul meu scump si drag :(( :".... te iubesc! :((...
Mii? :(:(...
Francesca is my name😅
!! :((... ingerul meu scump si drqg! :((... buna dimineata :(( :*...
is this about the famous women who go forced to marry some old man to then fall in love with her step brother and got killed?
This song is SOOO good!!!!
I swear Hozier was possessed by the spirit of Harlin Guthrie while writing this cause this entire album is so Malevolent coded
I feel it. I'd do it again.... differently.
What an incredibly beautiful song. Watched Hozier live in  Cardiff 2014, let me tell you, he can sing. Think this song solidifies him as my fave solo artist.
I hear this and IMMEDIATELY think of all those in my family I've lost. My birth caused a lot of heartache and sorrow and tore my family apart, but I survived and loved them nonetheless. I miss them every single day, but would chose THEM over and over for MY family.
This song is so beautiful 🥲
This song. Probably the best one that had this effect on me.
I love you forever Maddy. Until we meet again ❤
Everyone loves Andrew ❤
the greatest song to ever exist 🚬🙂‍↔️
trademark Hozier verses that go harder than they have any business doing:  "My life was a storm since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?"  "Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it"  and of course  "Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I"
WOW!

Francesca and Paolo ❤ ...Dante has inspired and will inspire artists all over the world forever. The best and most genius piece of literature you can ever read. Italian pride. Thank you Hozier for this beauty🙏
0:57 damn
the guitars distorting at the end with the sighs and distant voices reminding us of the eternal windstorm that Francesca and Paolo are doomed to face for loving each other is just the icing on the cake for me. Amazing work, as always.
Dante estaría orgulloso
Love this. So glad I finally found you guys!

LLF. I will never forget you.

Everything about this video gives me a natural high❤. All of the musicians, the beat, Andrew, the visuals....it makes my heart....  I can't find the right words .. THANK YOU Andrew for this sensational video.
This man sings his heart❤️
so umm just saw him live this week and hearing this song live was insane. Everything I could've asked for and more. I quite literally ascended through the roof of the kia forum after this song was over.
Perez Carol Rodriguez Ruth Smith Gary
El amor es quiza la cosa más misteriosa del mundo pero tal vez ese lejano Paraiso de Eternidad y Ternura se oiga como el epilogo de Francesca.
This is Great Song Very Woooow

Like what @knothing4579 said except I want to be reminded that this MAN exists.
The drummer in the background having the time of his life !
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 whenever I listen this song. I remembered a lot of things, my childhood, my youth .
Seeing this live in 4 days and it’s the only thing holding me together
This song makes me grateful that humans get to experience love
Hozier's gotta be one of the best songwriters out there
Wow amo esta canción ❤😭😳🍷🤌
"No grave can hold my body down, I'd crawl home to her" used to be my favorite Hozier lyric but "My life was a storm, since I was born, how could I fear any hurricane?" Hits so so so hard
A st d VI saplica theoo
This song is brilliance 🖤 pure brilliance! It is on replay all day 🌹
i heard this ong for the first time a year ago love in cardiff castle and have not been the same since. the emotions in this one are so raw and angry and painful and that ending section is so so stunning
Just finished reading The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern, which has nothing to do with Hozier or his music BUT I can't help but think this song also fits Marco and Celia sooo well. Especially from Marco's perspective by the way the author wrote him! These are some parts that made me think of them:  "Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?"  "If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again"  "When the heart would cease, ours nеver knew peacе"
Strike has been my favorite song from Hozier since its conception. However, this has a chokehold on my soul. ❤
I now identify as Hozier's "Francesca" 😂💙💙💙
So you mean he red Dante and then wrote this song? I am soooo here for it!!!!!
Sorry to my bunny...
Beautiful song
His voice feels truly unique.
sobbing violently cuz i want to have a love like this wtf
the yearning i feel to just be in that room as they play this song forever
Wow... What else can I say
Espero que la sigas escuchando y amando tanto la letra de Franchesca , aún recuerdo tus hermosas palabras contándome el libro de dante en mis odios . ❤
Lyrics Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)
❤😂❤🎉😅❤
Why is gay love like ten times more passionate than straight love- sincerely a straight woman having a midlife crisis
I want a man to love me like Hozier loves women. Like lesbians lol
The lyrics clean my soul whereas the melody trembles old memories with a girl named Francesca during my UK erasmus time.... I used to have a crush with her. She never noticed because I was not able to tell her.
the thought and originality behind these lyrics are unbelievable the energy  the band  cant get over it
Idk what this song has in it but I love it
This is one of the best love songs of all time....
I don't know how to do this.
ฉันชอบมันมาก
This is the first time I've actually listened to the lyrics and I'm crying
I tell me to put it back in and I would do it again, but then I think about child support and I’m like I’m good.
Nothing could have made me give up or shook the love out of me ..i still hang on against all odds ..it probably destroys me but i still say put me back in it  even if i had to experience the same intense pain..I would have   just wanted to experience the intensity of true love just for one minute despite the cost..i loved you,i never gotten over you.iI wish only happiness and the best for you in spite of hurting me  because i want what is best for you .even it is not me...
Screamed realising this song is called FRANCESCA LIKE THAT'S MY NAME?!
Speechless
Adoro. I would do it again🥰
I’m so in love with this video 😩😩😩😩
My fave line: my life's been  a storm since the day I was born. How could I fear any hurricane
My love for this song is unexplainable
I've experienced this song while at the concert in Dublin, in Marlay Park a week ago.. With nearly 40 thousand people singing along it was something to behold.
This is devastatingly beautiful and I can't stop listening. My religion is whatever Hozier preaches.
If Hozier ever comes to Central America or Mexico I'll be there to lose my voice singing from the top of my lungs all his songs... This man is an amazing songwriter 😍😍😍😍
my ex was really into hozier, introduced me into it and i listened through all the songs. we even went to a concert and everything. i miss her so dearly, this song reminds me so much of her. i hope she knows that i would still go through hell and back for her as many times as i can
as mack explained?????
Gracias a esa persona especial que me recomendó esta canción. Espero me recuerdes así como yo te recuerdo cada que la escucho.
Hozier is a rockstar
Way better than Too Sweet. I'll never understand why this doesn't have more views.
This is good music.
💎
One of the best outros to a song I've heard in decades - what a masterful performance
Outstanding.  An emotional, thought provoking, timeless masterpiece ❤

Voglio ringraziarti per aver condiviso questa bellissima canzone e questo fantastico video✳️ Complimenti ed un meritato applauso 👏 Buon mezzogiorno 🌞☕ A più tardi 🇮🇹 ✔️🤗💙
Questa canzone mi piace molto ecco perché Laura è contenta che Laura ho fatto tutto con te francesca ti prometto che dico il resto quello che ho detto Erica malizia e Rossella d'Antonio io Laura voglio farlo anche con te francesca cappa tua Laura e questa la mia vita privata tra Laura e Francesca cappa e erica e pure Rossella che c'è lo dentro nel mio cuore per seriamente e questa la verità che porto dentro nel mio cuore
I'd tell them put me back in it
I'm set in my ways  It just wouldn't work, Unfortunately
.
Since I first heard this song I've so desperately wanted to hear a version with him and Florence Welch singing together.  The huge orchestral bits reminds me so much of "Too Much is Never Enough" from the FF15 soundtrack and I think hearing the addition of her voice through out the song would be incredible.
How does this song not have more views!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?
https://youtu.be/5wGOWbsFf-0?si=lJGi0ZRCcckMJjOG
Genius, Bravo 👏
I realize this isn't what the song is about but its become an anthem for me feeling towards my daughter.  20 weeks into my pregnancy we found out she had a multitude of health problems.  Her dad couldn't cope and wasn't very present for the pregnancy.  It was an extremely traumatic experience.  A million stories of individual traumatic experiences within my pregnancy with her alone and terrified. And yet her life and death remain some of the most cherished moments of my life. I often struggle with the unbelievable love i feel for her tied in with this crippling trauma.  How both can coexist.  This song speaks so much to that feeling.  If i could hold you for a minute, id go through it again...
listened to this song bringing my kids home from the hospital when they were born and i’m listening to it now while their grandparents have temporary custody and the lyrics “if i could hold you for a minute, i’d go through it again” just break me every time
Caramba fazia tempo que não aparecia alguém realmente COM A MÚSICA EM SI❤
Hi Hozier, make me a song about Ofelia 😅 please. I'm finally going to read The Divine Comedy just for you.
❤❤❤
there’s something about this song that will always choke me up when ever i hear it, in the most beautiful way.
I associate this song, especially the chorus, with a thunderstorm. It only makes the experience of listening to it more beautiful.
eu absolutamente entendo o sucesso de too sweet, mas o album está preenchido de obras incríveis! Vão ouvir. Minha favorita é De Selby 1
Gonna tell my kids this was Russell Brand.
his voice and lyricism hit me right in the bone.I am crying because of this art.
" I would still be surprised i could find you darlin in ANY LIFE"  THAT KILLS ME! JUST STABS ME IN THE HEART EACH TIME.
There hasn’t been a song that has stopped me in my tracks like this since Cancer by MCR
The vocals, the musical arrangement is sublime, in headphones or just blasting it on speakers it does something especially the last minute of the song. The lyrics and meaning of this song I cant express how much I love this. (I'm no Andrew lol) even the style this video is amazing
Best song of the album which is saying a lot since almost all the songs are really good!
His voice his passion shows with every note! A true artist 🥰
OMG...complete, indestructable, love and devotion
This has such a lovely 90s rock ballad vibe, it feels like it's been here for ages (and it's not even a year at this point). They somehow found a good director to keep it in the video too 🙃
I've always been a fan of hozier's and I just discovered this song ang my name is Lovely Francesca. This instantly became my top1 😭🫶🏻
I want you😅
I don’t know much about the music industry BUT I think now ( I’m writing this Saturday 11 April 2024.) is the time to re-release this song. I sadly missed it first time. I’m sure it did well but I feel it should, must be heard by more and more.
This song reminds me of Uma, my dog and my company for almost 14 years of my life! I literally would go through it ALL again. Thank you bb, love you forever ❤‍🩹 2010 - 2024
his voice is so angelic
coming back every day for the feeling of being in the eye of hurricane this song brings
Solo vine por TikTok y la explicación de la chica sobre la conexión entre esta canción y la Divina Comedia
you can tell hozier is intelligent by the way he writes both his tweets and his music just pure genius
Alone under
can’t and won’t get this chorus out my my head ! Thank you for great music

this is literally one of the BEST songs ever.
Esto es arte .
I'd love to know how he smells... Not in a perverted way but I just want to listen to his voice and smell him at the same time cause looking at him from a screen is not enough
Just love the music x
This video makes me feral
oh god
It's a random Monday.  It's 22:17.  I'm in the dark.  Bawling for a love like this.
Grazie mille caro Hozer 🎶✨👍
You know that the love you felt, and still feel, to that person, was real. Even though you know how it was meant to end in pain, you'd still go back in time to hold her once more, even for a minute.
My name is Francesca🩷💪🏼
Thank you for write this song for me ! I appreciate it.
Absolutely stunning❤
❤
Mii?.... ingerul meu scum si drag:*... te rog :(:(...

I can't believe #TeskeyBrothers Supported #Hozier last year  That's a once in a lifetime Rare Experience  These two Amazing Artists , Together!!! I could think of nothing better!?!  Please, on my knees consider joining forces again guys... Please!??... 🇬🇧 ❤️💕
#Hozier is truly A Brillant #PoeticArtist  A Rare Gem 💎 ❤
Wow
am scapat de tarfa de Beyoncé. #POTSATIFOLOSECPUNCTUL? -
This video is very reminiscent of A Perfect Circle's Judith
"Do you think I'd give up?"
"Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I"  It would be nice if you can hear this clearly...the instruments toping their voices .

I know the story behind the song - I get it.  But this one hits HARD on the grief of losing my Dad.  Do not ask me why.  But it always makes me think of him - All that pain, all that illness but to hug him one more time?  All of it.  Repeat.  Just for that. This man melts my bones every time he opens his mouth
Wow the fact that someone will have the divine pleasure of being loved by this guy🥰🥰🥰
Can not stop watching ❤
Dios cada vez que lo escucho siento que me muero y vuelvo a nacer. Hozier nunca me defrauda. Me llena del amor que aún no conozco
Never really listened a lot to Hozier. This song and: 'Unknown / Nth' make me want to discover more of his music. It's incredible. Thanks to whoever recommended me these songs.
Wowww!! What ???? Can not stop watching. Another level ❤❤❤❤
"If I could love you for a minute, I'd go through it again" had me bawling in my car. Kudos to him for being such a literate, illustrative storyteller.
"وإن كنت أقدر أحب تانى أحبك انت"
The fact that this was written with someone in mind shatters me to my core. Oh to be loved by Hozier
Knowing how much I adore Hozier, and the music that he makes.... I was so lost in love, I dedicated it. And yes, I regret it because I can't listen to it without thinking about my ex, but that didn't stop it from being so much more important than silly breakups. Definitely one of my favorites, even if I remember horrible things with this.
All the choices in my life led me to the love of my life so every hour I spend with her, every minute I get to see her, every second I get to feel her makes me know that I would live this life again for nothing else other than to see her
reminds me a little of Steve Perry
Как меня доканали эти замызганные комментаторы оставляющие своими гадкими ручонками филистерские каракули  На кассу в kfc сброд невзрачный пусть унитазы вилками чистят
Why is this not playing on the radio 😮‍💨it’s literal magic
The love of my life just left me and this song fits this situation so perfectly I can't stop listening to it. And I had the fortune of watching Hozier perform it just two days ago. I will never get over this
I'll just leave this comment here so that when someone likes or reacted to this comment I'll be reminded of this MASTERPIECE!
Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)
Yes band good but they keep drowning out the amazing  vocals they will see that one day.
cry baby song, MAN UP!
This song deserves better i feel it i breath it it rushes in my veins
Francesca and Paolo would love this
I feel like this song has a beautiful silver lining within the lyrics like it seems sad but it's so romantic like a I'd go through life with you no matter what happens and still do it over again after
🎉🎉🎉🎉
I like how the final chorus of "Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and mine" sounds like an actual angelic choir.
❤❤❤
I kept repeating this song I love it and wanna attend a concert coming up in Edmonton ❤
TEAMOOOOO
the way he says "like a cancer that grows" scratches my brain just right
the fact this video deserves more likes ... truly champions
Just in case this needs to be said: I loved so much I cannot love anymore #hozier
I love artist’s slower stuff, but I never knew I needed this energy from Hozier… like seriously, one of my fav new songs I have heard in awhile.
Hozier’s sings in such a gut wrenchingly beautiful manner ❤
Every so often a real genius pops up......
As someone who has lost the love of my life, this song hits me so very deep. He may not exist physically anymore but the love hasn’t faded one bit. Him passing is the most painful thing I have ever dealt with but I am so grateful for the love I experienced with him. I would choose him every chance I could.
Best Ballad Rock Song of the 21st century🎼🎤🎸
sana tek bir dakika olsun sarılabilseydim.. sevgilim, yine olsa yine yapardım.
I dream of the day when Hozier comes to Ecuador 🇪🇨 😢
Hozier gives me high expectations of love ❤❤❤
Perfect voice, perfect lyrics ❤
This song only reminds me of one girl. We listened it all the road again and again crying for an hour before she went abroad to live. Like Hozier, I would say just “put me back in it”
I cannot imagine love expressed more deeply that how it feels in this song
Te quiero mucho Hozier.
De Selby and Francesca are my top favourites 😍
9:26 😂
This album totally hooked me with YOU Permanently , 🫢🤎🖤
So much grief is expressed in the final verses. It's heartbreaking.
Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)  Source: LyricFind Songwriters: Andrew Hozier-Byrne /  Jennifer Decilveo Francesca lyrics © Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC
God he never disappoints every song keeps getting better and better
This is a beyond touching beautiful song. The first time I heard it I was instantly filled with emotion and had so many tears running down my face. It really tells a story and you can feel the love in his voice that he speaks of. It's expressed heavenly and wholeheartedly. I can listen to this again and again and each time it speaks to my soul.
Voy a cantar esto a todo pulmón en unos dias al lado del amor de mi vida🥰
My life has been a complete storm since I was born, and still I am here, and I am not afraid of the hurricanes that might come. I know how difficult it is to love someone who in result for being hurt "too soon" and "ripped away" is mentally destroyed, but hearing of someone willing to go to hell twice for a loved one.... is like hearing how someone could go through all my battles, all my hell and still want choose me, or how even after all, I still appreciate to be here, alive, and how some moments in my life have been so beautiful, that "I'd go throught it again".  This song goes straight to my heart like not another song ever has. The understanding I feel, the hope I feel, everything!   Thank you Andrew, you have no idea, but this song impulsed me to take actions and seek help to heal my past and my heart❤
This song/video absolutely SHRED and I love the Chucky looking mfucker at 0:25 lolol
There aren’t many songs that change me. I feel more emotional and therefore stronger after listening to this song. And those are the songs I LIVE for! Both of my grandmothers died within 10 days of each other. This song, I’m instantly thinking of them. This feels like a love letter from them. I miss them everyday and cry over them every day (and that’s not an exaggeration), this song helps ❤ thank you Hozier. See you in August!!
Incredible powerful song and a WOW vocal performance.  And I need to add, I love his love of Epiphone guitars…the Wildkat model he’s playing is such a great-feeling guitar to play.
Am I the only one, when listening to this (about 100 times), literally screaming the words while balling my eyes out over the love I lost years ago?
Oh, to be loved like this!
who's Anthony Byrne to Hozier?? They have the same surname and i cant sleep bc of it XD
Need him biblically
its song for my daughter. shes died.
Lucyy🫶🏼🫶🏼🖤
When I heard the song first (without seeing the video ) , I knew it was gonna be under constructed sunset scene with jaw dropping visuals, THIS video is exactly what the song paints in my mind 🎉
Andrew what philosophy book do we need to send to you for the next album? We need to know stat your tours almost over. This masterpiece of an album could carry you for decades but we need more.
Oh, to be loved by Hozier 😩🥺
After losing my 16 year old brother to a freak car accident this song brings so many feeling to head. I miss him so much, he was the baby of my big family and this song encompasses everything I feel after his loss. He was so good and taken too soon. Thank you hoizer
That old dog has never said truer words to his wife, than he did through you, musical avatar that you are.
Esta canción me hace pensar en Eren y Mikasa
For Hozier     I heard the muted screaming, from the kidnapped in their tombs I heard the monsters laughing, amid their captives’ helpless cries I heard the mocking and the jeers, from the hospital rooms  I heard the calls for more bloodbaths, among the slander and the lies  I heard the newborn children in all of their sorrow, being tortured and, crying in vain I heard my parents tell me when I was a child, that it couldn’t ever, happen again  But silence, is what I heard Silence; no not a word Silence, is what I heard from you  Why do you turn mute, at the deaths of Jews? Is it not woke enough? Or is it just not news? You speak about racism, women and their young But when it comes to Jews, the cat has got your tongue Your infinite compassion, and love for all mankind Vanishes so quickly, when it comes to my kind  I heard the hateful chanting, from the racists in the streets I heard the jet planes flying; I thought that they would never end I heard “Never again!” as our history repeats I heard the faintest echo of, when you said you were my friend I heard the women screaming out for just some “Mercy!” amid their sobbing and their last dying breath But there’s no mercy for the raped and the butchered, just barbaric mobs calling out for more death  But silence, is what I heard Silence, no not a word Silence is what I heard from you I heard our calls for help, when we were at war But when I hear your call for help, when they come to your door Silence, is what you will hear Silence from far and near Silence, is what you will hear from me
This is a song for HOZIER       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6ei1b6k0I
OMG THIS IS PEETA MELLARK
He is a god damn poet 😍😍😍
there is something so loud about that last bit that just makes my mind go silent
When he says "Do you think I'd give up"... I melt
The beginning of this song remind anyone else of lion king ??
Oh, to love and be loved like a Hozier song has been my life’s unrealized quest. This song makes me weep.
Me tatuaria esta canción ❤
I saw him do this song at Shakey Knees…These lyrics literally gut punch me. My heart hurts listening to it and I can’t stop. I only love it more and more…
Am I the only over sharer who can never stop taking about hozier 24/7?
❤
This song....heck, this whole album has consumed my mind, heart and soul. So many songs hit so hard and bring out emotions and feelings that I had forgotten about.
As an italian i'm so happy that this mesmerizing song was inspired by one of our finest piece of literature
So smart. Thank you irishman❤
For facebook 😂
YOU ARE AMAZING
LIKE YOU AND I
This kind of love is a living hell. I wish I could be free of it every day.
Mal día para llamarme francesca😂😂
❤
I'm so blown away by this one.  When I first heard this song I thought it was  the band  SPACE Hog.  This is a iconic sound for the Guns and Roses crew.  A very bold move. Proving thier  rock n roll hall of fame existence has become a another legacy for all ages.  Thank you so very very much and I am so excited about this new place you guys are going with the best music for all ages and all of time's.  Tommytombstone Carter
that's my name :)
My best friend died of cancer on November 30. This is the last song I sang to him. I keep thinking there was more I could do to change the outcome. More I could do to help. But the one thing I am sure of is that even knowing how painful this loss is and all the hard times we would have, 'I would do it again.' That part of the song always hits me right in that part of my spirit that knows that there aren't any regrets for the love I gave and the hardships we had.
This is put under Christian music mix in u tube.  It's a joke right?
If I ever go to a Hozier concert I'd just ugly cry and sing the whole time.
SYLKI 😭😭😭
Something that impressed me even at the concert I attended is how Hozier gives credit and appreciation to everyone in his   team and even the Truck driver in a sincere way ❤
This lives rent free in my head 🔥😮‍💨
I can't stop listening to this. Had it on repeat for days
still feeling so perfectly normal about this
What a beautiful song! I love Hozier ❤
This song and video are so reminiscent of Dolores O'Riordan and The Cranberries that it genuinely makes me emotional every time I listen
Me gustaría que hozier escribiera un Libro ♧☆
i love this so much i want to CRY
I love this man. Hes a musical wonder.
How could You think?
My middle son died in my womb 10 days before his due date. No song is about "romantic" love anymore, but I heal especially when I listen to Hozier. His lyrics are genial, like a balm on my broken heart...
Hozier meu amor, essa musica toca em um cantinho especial do meu coração. Sempre vou guardar aquele meu  sonho♥️✨
Masterpiece
To: Loki 💚💙 For: Mobius💙💚
Let’s go!!!
I love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aside from the obvious historical and literary references, I just realized that the song can also apply to queer couples.  With how same-sex relationships are considered as a "sin" in most religions, the lines can be related to a queer couple forcefully separated (and/or killed) by society's heteronormative views.  "Though I know my heart would break, I'd tell them put me back in it",  "I'd go through it again" and "I would not change it each time" - their love for each other is so deep and strong that they'd go through it all over again, bear the pain of homophobia/transphobia, just to be with their lover And of course, the most beautiful line - "Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I" - can be referenced to how queer couples are constantly cursed to "go to hell" for their "sin", so the couple retaliates by:  1. Accepting hell as more fitting for their love, which is an ironical mockery of Heaven as lesser than the grand splendor it is made out to be by religious fanatics, therefore showing the falsehoods of religious extremists Or 2. Their love is not "sin" at all and is so blessed and passionate that Heaven itself says It is not worthy to house such a love, i.e., their love lies somewhere even beyond the Heavens  Either way, I'm just starting to appreciate the layers of depth in Hozier's works
The bridges of Madison County
Probably my most played song of 2023. A true masterpiece.
This Man has taken over My brain..
🧎‍♀🧎‍♀🧎‍♀
holy sh** this gave me goosebumps!
"My life was a storm since I was born. How could I fear any hurricane?"
Hozier is my Roman Empire.
He doesn't even bother replying. Such a person they say.
Embarrassing lefties crap
The song really dies when the sound shifts at 3:24 they had this really amazing sound and what? decided to do this really shity ending?
the most metal hozier song i have ever heard
Oh man... I keep getting surprised when music is that level of quality. Lyrics and melody just in lockstep with each other and it's all so beautiful it makes you want to cry. I like all the songs in _Unreal, Unearth_ but this one and "All things end" are just something else. Truly a masterpiece of an album.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This song is purely made for strong individuals only. Congrats 👏
This is my song, thank you. ❤
Beautiful
Really gives cranberries vibes and I am here for it😍
I've known you for as long as I can remember, and your still killing it! Me and my sister love your stuff. I don't know how ppl would feel if I said you should do a song with Labrinth.
the song is amazing but no one is talking about the way the video is done—the editing, the choreography, the lighting, staging, all brilliant
So amazing ❤❤❤
These lyrics are so amazing..I love this song .
OMG INCREDIBLEEEE
F…ing hell Hozier !……. this is brilliant….
My best friend passed Friday night...I think this song fits
uffff
Return of the 80s rock ballads 👌👌👌👊👊👊👊
Thank you gods for Hozier.
I think god sent him to us through the covid and too much sadness. He's an angel ❤
I’m in complete aw
This song makes me feel like an earthworm in a thunderstorm.
3:32 I feel like my soul just got taken to church
Its just like hearing angels sing to you.
I have so many words and yet none are enough to express how much I adore this song. ❤
And to think i thought he couldn’t top his first album anytime soon
Hozier please keep that  drumer..
<3
since the first time i heard this song it gave me nostaugia.... i have a felling it plays at the credits rolling of some movie, not sure whitch tho
This should’ve been as big as Take Me To Church
This is so Valgrace coded oh my lord
💙
i didn't think i could fall harder for this man but he comes out with this song and looks like that and i just melt! thank u sir for giving us this beautiful album!
i can imagine his doing a grunge album, will be so epic
Hozier really went for the jugular with this album, huh.
Has anyone check out the story of Francesca in Dante’s divine comedy ? Omg true chills ! He is singing what Francesca would say in hell 😮😮😮 Her story is amazing and is based on a true story from 1300 around that time 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Hozier is a genius
This song is everything! I can’t stop listening
I listened to this album three times in a row, and the night After I dreamt of becoming Friends with Hozier in a pub in Ireland. Does anyone noticed a strong similarity with the Cranberries?
I am obsessed with this song😊
put me back in it (w)
I love this song but it's driving me crazy that I know I heard in on the end credits of a show or movie but can't for the life of me find what it was
Amazing song...this guy...next level
Dante et Vergilius pro Francesca da Rimini:  Putas me cessurum? Hoc  amor(em) a me cussurum  Aut m(e) in margine? Ut putares, Cara, me terreri facile?

Master, you did it again.
Bedankt voor deze geweldige vlog 😌 Hahah ik ben èèn keer in Sassenheim geweest om een vriend te bezoeken, we wonen best wel ver uit elkaar dus spreken meestal in t midden van het land af. Toch cute wat ze er van gemaakt hebbdn 🎃
How am I supposed to ever recover from this? How am I supposed to feel what I feel with this song ever again with another song?
Eu simplesmente a voz dele.  ❤
It sounds exactly like falling in love with someone that is also in love with you... damn...
Was all like “take me to church isn’t really my bag” then out of nowhere this masterpiece hits me  🤯
What a song! Something about the vocals reminds me of the Cranberries! I love it!
Haha, Uncle Benjen returned with a band and I'm here for it! 🫶
Beautiful, melodiously clear voice that touches one senses. Love it!💕
it's not enough to just hear this song. i need it injected into my veins 🫠
Goddd, this songg, the way he stresses certain words, the video. Can't get over itt
currently mourning the loss of one of my core friendships dissolving before my eyes, somehow this song that has nothing to do with that sums up how i’m feeling pretty accurately.
There's Something About The Power & Passion In/Of His Voice That Makes Me Feel That His Music Should Be Played In of all things Houses Of Worship! Beginning With TAKE ME TO CHURCH! I Find His Voice TRANSCENDENT!
Te amo, Hozier
Whenever I feel hopeless that no one else in this world shares the unfathomable love that I feel, I remember Hozier exists and it gives me a little hope.
Hopefully this will help people spell my name correctly. ❤
It's 3:00 a.m. Philly time. All is asleep and I want to scream singing this song....see ya on Sept 29 th at the Mann. 😊❤
This song wow love it
I absolutely love this song and can’t get enough of it also with eat your young and many others of course
I just went to his concert yesterday and listening to it right now. Hits different
I luv this song and I'm so excited I'm gonna go to his concert
❤❤❤❤❤
"i'd tell them put me back in it"  the POWER behind this mans voice. and yet in all his interviews he's so gentle. what a man.
Who the hell is Francesca
Another incredible song from Hozier. It's too bad the camera people didn't focus more on the great backup singers.
I've loved this song since it came out a few months ago, but I just finished watching Shadowhunters for the first time which has left me really emotional... but I have to say, this is easily Jace and Clary's song. No doubt in my mind.
Goosebumps
Stunning literary themes aside - When I listen to this song, I always think of all the amazing partners, family members, chosen family or best friends who are helping a loved one going through horrendous mental health breakdowns, hard times and/or shame and are instrumental to their recovery. I feel like this is an homage to them ❤
Dante´s Inferno 😍
Friend: Hey man Hozier has this heavier sound on this song… Me: say no more let me experience it. Me:… Me:…(an absolute shell with every trauma subconsciously unfolding for the day) Next day me to friend: Yea man I loved that song…a lot.
This is everything. You can't ever fully "recover" from a song like this.  I can't imagine the loss that fueled these lyrics. Well, actually, I can. And that's why he's an artist of a lifetime.
3:34 literally the best part my eardrums are going crazy
this was ridiculously incredible live, genuinely think i left my body for a minute.
I'D TELL THEM PUT ME BACK IN IT
I just recently liked Cherry Wine, Take me to church, Like real people do and Work Song because of the cottage core trend on tiktok. But when eat your young came out, I wasn't that ecstatic because  I forgot my history lesson. But, I listened the whole album last week. And man, you just made me realised the reason why I have to keep on writing a poem. To express my emotions that I can't just tell anyone, even tthe only 2 souls i trusted. and right now, or during my free time I wrote poetry while listening to your music. I just hope you rest well on your free time.
god this song is beautiful… anyone know who the guy at 3:20 playing guitar & doin backup vocals is? or any of the other backup vocalists/musicians? any info is appreciated thanks :)
One of the best songs I've heard in 20 years. I want an all-out rock album with some heavy guitars and drums from Hozier.
Grande ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is this the most painfully beautiful song ever? I love that, despite being named for a reference to a romantic relationship, he kept the video ambiguous. The sentiment could apply to all types of relationships.
Carrying on in the proud tradition of angry Irish singers.  So good.
I’d go through it again.
I just can't stop listening plays over and over in my head gets me through the cardio session at the gym.
Esta canción se llama como yo, no mames
I really love this song! It’s a piece of art 🙌🏽
This could have been written for me. My partner has been through so much in their life, I know they think the repercussions of it all scare me. And yet, time and time again, I weather the storms with them and do so gladly because having them in my life brings such joy and light into every second of it.  Screaming winds, roaring thunder, scouring hail, I would tell them to put me back in every single time.
Who gave this man permission to rip everybody's guts out like this?
Hello, my name is Francesca and this resonates with my soul!😍👌
Francesca Da Rimini is so fucking badass for this.
Esse cara assistiu Good Omens, né possível isso não...
Melhor música!
“Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me?” Is absolutely the most realistic heartfelt statement I’ve heard in a while. I will always love him forever and evers❤️‍🩹 my lovely personification of the “first time” is him🧡 it wasn’t a toxic break up at all.  im glad I got to experience love as I did with him. I know we’re still young, so I do have faith that the universe will reunite us when when we’re both in more mature stages. I will adore you in the distance now mi tesoro, the sun will shine on us again, my sunny honey☀️ please be safe N
The way he says “each piece of your BODY that it takes.” 😭❤️
WXRT CHICAGO brought me here
For some reason it feels like it could be a Meatloaf masterpiece. It’s beautifully theatrical. chills and tears.
I absolutely love this song.  His voice is so rich and clear.  I could listen to this over and over.  I feel this is the best album he has put out to date.  He has grown as an artist and the control of his voice is exquisite.
🤩🤩🤩
My mums boyfriend passed away yesterday and I can do absolutely nothing to help her. It kills me to see her like this but this is the only song that will cure my grieving.
yall are sleeping on "My life was a storm since I was born so how could I fear any hurricane"
Hozier going to be one of the top greatest 🇮🇪🎸🎼🇮🇪
Every time Hozier sings "i would do it again" I just can't help but tear up, what an emotional song! Love you Andrew!!
I love how they all sing in a round at the end, how it’s a blur of voices mimicking the chaos of a hurricane
If we are to send any shit in to space for aliens to find, it should be Hozier’s discography.
Please keep this style
Every time I hear his music, it makes me feel more connected to the Mother Earth. I know that most of his songs talk about god or a god,  it to me it is speaking of Her. Idk why
This song has been on replay in my playlist of heartbreak longings 💔 I miss you so much Captain Jack… won’t you come back? I would do it again… find you, darling in any life 💜 would not change it each time… Cue the deluge of tears at 3:21 🥹
This song is incredible!
brutal refren
Классная песенка !  Рок
My names francesca lol good song ❤️
If I could hold you for a minute, I’d do it all again 🖤
This is so overwhelmingly beautiful. Music has an unmatchable power, it's magical and life affirming. Andrew is a fenomenal musician, singer and songwriter. His work is so rich, poetical and raw. He really knows how to portray the human experience in a way that reaches all of us and moves every fiber of our bodies. His music makes me feel alive, both through pain and beauty. A true artist.
francesca
Is too hot 🧋🍦🍩
Breaktaking
This is extremely fitting to Patroclus and Achilles's love story :')) especially from Patroclus's perspective, god it's so perfect
Beyond words.
This man knows music
My lover name was Francesca, we parted ways, I still think about her in the pink light of love, I know that if I were to sin it would be of lust, just to hear her name again and again in the wind, strip myself of my identity, let me be, just once more, the Paolo of our lost love
❤ beautiful song.
I was touched by your majestic beautiful song!!! great songwriting!!! great work!!!
Dude I love everything about this video -- including the 90s grunge feel of warehouse with a storm in the middle of an incredibly industrial and indie song. This is amazing -- and I love it 10/10 - - also the fact that grunge is equate to Hell -- *mwah*chefs kiss -- I can't believe that this exist in the year 2023, it is like something out of 1993 and I literally want to marry this song. Mary if you ever find this comment -- I want this to be the wedding song.
Apaixonada nessa música 👉👈🥺✨
What a talented man... ❤
Masterpiece is an understatement
Obsessed🎧
the first verse reminded me of the 12th doctor and clara when he told her: "do you think i care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?" 💙 anyway, i'm so in love with this song right now.
IF SOMEONE ASKED ME AT THE END I'D TELL THEM PUT ME BACK IN IT !!!!!!!
daredevil and elektra
❤️
He estado esperando una canción con ese título por tanto tiempo 😭♥️
I listened yesterday for first time, just today I heard it 12 times hahaha. If there´s nothing more romantic to say that I would go back to hell to hold you for a minute, I don´t know what would be.....
Q necesidad había de probar si ya estaba superado 😢

"Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse: quel giorno più non vi leggemmo avante"  Inferno, canto V (5)
It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away 🗨️🗨️  (aaahhhh)
hozier just woke up one day and said ok time to make the best song of all time :) AND HE DID
this is song is such beautiful and your voice is angelic 😍
Crying, wow
He's something else !
Hozier is Jesus
Not me just discovering this song from the new album... if I could inject this song into my veins i would
This is my favourite song by him
Dude does not get enough credit. He's super talentled.
Its like my soul has been ripped out and thrown in a blender. Do it again.
anyone else out here thinkin about good omens
This is just- heartbreakingly beautiful. I get that feeling of something trying to leap out of my throat, and it’s just, wow. Like a human person created this song. And is just someone you could see on a street. It’s just baffling. Even more so, the person this was wrote about also wanders the earth. It makes me want to cry of joy and sadness. Incredible piece. Just amazing
Боже! Это настолько прекрасно, что я не могу описать словами😍💎Эта песня напомнила мне о всех самых прекрасных моментах в моей жизни и самых грустных моментах когда моё сердце было разбито, а душа рыдала, и забрала всю боль. Осталось только спокойствие, как после шторма. Спасибо за то, что делитесь с нами своим огнём и талантом💎❤️
Daaaah daaarrrlinnng 🥹😭😍
This is the only good thing about this summer for me 😄
El volumen al Máximo ya no es suficiente, necesito a Hozier cantándomela en vivo
So glad to have hozier love the album it's a masterpiece ❤❤❤🖤🖤❤️❤️
Heaven on earth
😍😍😍😍😍
This is one my favorite songs ever, hozier is so underrated
sehr gut lied
He's amazing!

Espero te guste ♡ Laoz ♡♡
oh to be loved the way that hozier loves...
QUÉ TEMAAAAAAAAAZOOOOOOOO!!!, la concha de la lora!!!!
"If someone asked me at the end, I would say put me back in it!!"  ❤️
This song touched me so deeply, I decided to do a cover of it. Hard to do justice to it, but gave it a go anyways on my channel :)
Thanks for so beautifully memorializing the tragic history of Francessca
Don't go further
Hozier out here again making us remember heartbreaks we dont even know yet.
Me encanta esta canción!!
I LOVE when Hozier does rock!! This so easily could be a Cranberries song, stylistically, lyrically. And with his voice!! What a class act Hozier, you're a genius 👏
Rips me to shreds.....my soul flies away..❤
Hai ca Yemeni Blues o lămâie aiurea.
“My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?”  I feel these lyrics in my bones. They bring up all the emotions that I have been holding in. To be able to do that, I truly do believe that Andrew you are a genius.
Did anyone else watch Good Omens season 2 and think of this song at the end or just me?
Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?  If someone asked me at the end  I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah  For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes  Though I know my heart would break  I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah  I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)
What a beautiful song that you have scripted for your brothter!Anyone could apply that beauty To a beauty and git lt!I am assigning this song already. 2:14 2:14
So no one noticed the lil green Dino that kept popping up? 😂🦖
Omg i love him so much 🥺❤️
When I heard this for the first time, I was nearing the end of a twelve hour drive and I almost had to pull over because I was SOBBING because this song was like having a religious experience 😭
❤
just died dead
This is what human ascension sounds like. I'm convinced of it.
The emotions and words are so raw, so sincere, it makes me break out in tears just hearing “i’d go through it again.”
I imagine someone singing this about me, I’m so hard to love thanks to my BPD and trauma, oh how amazing it must feel to have someone love you this much to go through the 9 rings of hell for you and sing to do it again.
My name is Francesca and I heard someone mention this song so I listened to it and now I love it
I can´t love this song more than I love it already. But if I could, I would absolutely do it each time I hear it again
*as a Francesca, I highly recommend and approve of this song*
Keep the good work going ❤
господи, это прекрасно
Like Picasso is to art...  Hoizer is to music. ❤ from 🇯🇲
Getting Cranberries vibes...  Not a bad thing
Uh.... I have listened to this song a million times since it came out and only just now watched the music video and it's like a brand new experience. Holy shit.
This song is like it was written for me and Bejb. Bejb, if you read this, please come back to me. I miss you. I love you. Put me back in it! :srce:
I need to swipe my memory off just to hear this for the first time again
Omg this is literally the best song I’ve ever heard
You can't go wrong with a video shot in a warehouse practice space, though this one might be more like an old brick mill building with wooden supports.  Totally different genre, but it definitely brings me back to the 80s/90s hair bands on MTV.  https://youtu.be/Bz61YQWZuYU
today like 3 hours ago I saw Hozier play Alexandra Palace in London, not only him but the entire band in this video accompanied him on stage in this tour. I have never heard someone sound so flawless play live it was the best concert I have EVER been to. It was dark, electric, sexy, stunning in every sense and it was incredible seeing this man live for the first time after years of listening to him daily.
Fantastic. The production is magical.
This song video is like pure nostalgia, because it looks like the song videos of early 2000's which used to be so great. Only Hozier can bring these kind of vibes to a song.
I'm seeing him live in the fall and ohhhhhh my god. This song live might literally send me to another dimension
My 1.5 year old daughter loves this song so much, she claps and says “Yay!!” at the end. 🥹
I knew Francesca would hit! I was just in a mainstream, sports bar type place and Francesca started playing. I was quietly so excited!
i absolutely love this song
I am obsessed with a~ah a~ah ❤
¿Algún Hispanohablante que le guste Hozier como a mi?  💕 TE AMO HOZIER, ERES MI ÍDOLO💕
And now I've come where grief and weeping pierce me at the heart....... Love, who no loved one pardons love's requite, seized me for him so strongly in delight that, as you see, he does not leave me yet. Love drew us onwards to consuming death.
Oh My God 😮
Simply beautiful!!!
Reading what this song is based on has made it so much more moving to me.
I love the little green dinosaur. 🥹
"If I could hold you for a minute, darling, I would do it again" it's just so painful and devastatingly beautiful, Hozier invented yearning when he wrote this song.
How you sound this good this is stunning
Wowww😍😍😍
GOD lyricist
Broo! This is art
❤❤❤
it's the "i'd tell them put me back in it" for me T_T
I have been listening to this song over and over for a week now... and it gives me goosebumps every time <3
I am truly always amazed at how our hozier can just keep reaching in and making sense of the deepest of shit ..@thankful4it , genuis and brillant  ,,i predict peopel wil stil find this mysic in 70years and stil be touched.  The new lenard coen poet and biblical.  End of rant . Much love all ❤ lisa
💙
Put me in coach! Always!
That voice
Zombie - The Cranberries vibes
I’ve been listening to this song on repeat for the past week since I first heard it. There is so much beauty, pain and transcendence in this work of art. Hozier, you have created a masterpiece.
Why’d you have to break my heart with “I’d tell them put me back in it” like that 😢

“My life was a storm, since I was born. How could I feel any hurricane?” Gets me every fucking time dawg.
Speaks to the part of us that can endure the trials of life to love
the KING
All I can hear when listening to this song is "Can you feel the love tonight?" from The Lion King.
❤❤❤

These lyrics!!!! Woooooooowww...    My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?  If someone asked me at the end  I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaSiqlwkK7U&ab_channel=WaterTowerMusic
You can never get through me
this has got major 80's vibes..
I love his voice
Fucking love this shit
This new song caught my eye.   Just last week, a dear friend named Francesca lost her battle with cancer, so the timing of this was uncanny.  Perhaps that is why I took to this song like I have.    Great job on this.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Thank you for this song - it's beautiful!  Greetings from Italy😊
This song takes me to heaven!
Wow I loved it 🖤🖤
It already sounds like a classic !!
❤
💋 ❤🫶🏻 @hozier
Absolutely obsessed with this song, in fact I've started reading Dante's divine comedy. The power that hozier has over me is insane
where is the two black man kissing ?
One of the most powerful songs in 2023 (if not the most). Thank you for such a passion! Love from Ukraine ❤🇺🇦
Nu minte
The Irish and their way with words and song
Each album has held a special place in my body and soul. ❤
Amazing ❤
the drumming!
If angels are just regular humans who share their gifts, he is at god status.
It has been a month and I still feel like I'm drowning, suffocating, soaring and bursting all at once whenever I hear this song
gracias
Me en cantan las cansiones de hosier muy Bonito letra de Todas ❤😍💞
Hail Hozier!
💕
Ohh you've been listening to Mew, don't you? :D
Love this song ❤
I know its not as heavy but this vid is giving me Nickelback vibes
Ohh Andrew    … “put me back in it “.   Selfless !
My heart…. ❤. Thank you Andrew..
This song has a Big time cranberries vibe, and im here for it
If I could hold you for minute I'd go through it again ❤️ Miss you everyday mum
🍀💚
Does anyone wants the end of this song to be it’s own song? It does something to me that I cannot explain!
This looks and sounds so much like Soundgarden or Alice in Chains, the song and the video both. The beautiful lyrics and thoughtful Dante references are buried in the leather jacketed fuzz rock.
No but a song about something that happened so long ago is actually so personal
You're taking my breath.
I can hear his Irish accent in this one and it adds another layer to his voice he is a true artist
Why do I hear The Cranberries in this song? so good!!!
I think we're done. He did all the music. We're good.
Francesca is such a pretty name that it is a shame it isn't actually mentioned in the song itself
Love it! He's getting married soon to his longtime GF.
😃😲such an amazing. Saw performed at Glastonbury ❤️👍🏻
Love from pakistan❤
Great song up to about the 3:18 mark when it sounds like the amp is malfunctioning and is too jarring.  In fact the first time i heard it I though my computer was crashing and playback had become stuck.  By the time it stops about a minute later, it is too late to "recover" the song.    It seem much more of a "rock song" than Hozier's other songs although I have only heard a limited number of his songs so perhaps I should say than of his better known songs.  I wonder how many people will get that the song is about/relates to the 2nd Circle of Hell from Dante's Inferno (The Divine Comedy).  Francesca is the married Italian noblewoman condemned for her lustful actions with her husband's brother.
Are there worse videos than those of this kind with just the band playing the song in some random abandoned place as if it was cool.. like cmon
Every song I've heard from the album is so finely crafted and so emotionally powerful. 🧠 🎶 ❤  That is very hard to accomplish.  "Unreal Unearth" should win many Grammys! 🏆🤞
hearing rock music instead of his angelic voice nearly caused me to faint
Thank you, Hozier. You saved me when you wrote this song. One of the darkest days I’d ever experienced and I see that my favourite artist had released a new song titled with my name🤍
More. Of. This.
This will be a Sleeper Hit
My life was a storm, since I was born. How could I fear any hurricane
The lyrics 😭 incredible ! Off to see him tomorrow. The ending is Sigur Ros ❤
Awe my name is Francesca and I casually searched this up not loooking for this one but made me feel great to be loved by someone and I couldn’t watch it because of flashing lights but tysm :)
Às vezes volto aqui. Gosto tanto desse vídeo e dessa música! Uma obra-prima🥰
You're like the biggest inspiration. EVER.
BEAUTIFUL!
♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍♥️😎👍
No words can describe this song. It's just..............
My younger brother is in very poor health, he's been better mentally than he was, but his physical health is deteriorating. He's in a medical hospital this weekend, that we are praying will bring better results.  I'm going to see Hozier on October 22 in Vancouver, with my older brother.  Absolutely cannot wait! Thanks so much for the new music, Andrew! Loving it!
Es que este ser siempre me hace sentir cosas indescriptibles con su música 💖
my jaw has dropped, another masterpeice, i cant wait to see the show in portland!!!!!!!!
Beautiful. Masterpiece.
Any one else hear a tiny bit of Dolores O’riordan in this gem ?
Super gay!!!
SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we get a guide on that heavenly outro? :<
Hozier is what the world need
❤
❤❤❤
❤❤
Oh Fer freakass awesome! Message me please...I'm a real person....thanks Jeanie Dodson....Find me....help me do a fucking huge project for the planet....❤️🤍😇🦋
I really wish I would stop hearing this song. It is terrible!
I AM NOT SOBBING YOU ARE SOBBING
In una parova Bellisimo !!!!!!!! Maurizio da Fiume Croatia
Bravissimo!
❤️
This could possibly be the worst song that I have ever heard.
This song sucks so bad. It must be why they try to play it between good videos.
I’ve listened to this everyday since I’ve heard it
Dolores wants her riff back...
This song keeps coming up as a commercial when I'm trying to listen to AC\DC. This song sucks so bad, but at least it's not rap. Does anyone else ever have this issue?
I love when the lyrics are in the description. Very thoughtful.
🔥🔥🔥
Amazing, how much truth and wisdom. Love the tempo and dynamic changes within the beat.
IF ONLY I HAVE THE POWER TO HAVE MY KPOP AND OTHER FANDOM FAMILY TO STREAM HOZIER'S SONGS. IM GETTING SICK OF HOW UNDERRATED HE IS THAT I NEED TO TYPE IN UPPERCASE.🕯️🕯️make it happen prayers🕯️✨
I want to hear the new song,  come on
Восторг! Слова тут не нужны.
someone tell me he's not emulating Hillsong, this is exactly what contemporary worship sounds like😭😭
This makes me think of my late fiancé. Even knowing all the pain that would come at the end I would go through it all again just to hold him once more
I danced with my new husband to this yesterday. we have both had hard lives and we have had to hold each other's heads above the waves a lot this year, but things will get better.
Reminds me of Jeff Buckley
I heard that Hozier actually climbed down into the ninth circle of hell to film this music video
Thanks for the bop, Christ
I get very excited everytime you release a new song, keep up the good work! ✨ +1 subscriber
Hozier every time make's me cry. He always doing something unbelievable. It worth to waiting so long a new album
❤
I ADORE READING
I feel blessed to have my name
Hozier, i BEG YOU for a feat. with Florence Welch!! PLEASE!!!! 😭😭😭
I didn't think he could come up with anything more painfully romantic than Work Song or In a Week but bloody hell, this is heart wrenching. I can't stop listening and I'm so excited for the album.
Hozier's a force of nature.
Absolutely spectacular thank you for sharing this with all. God Bless everyone. #kjb #thechamp
I like his silver voice but it reminds me about Take me to church, which gave me a psychological trauma (after watching the clip). I do not know why I am writing this... Perhaps to heal the trauma... 😢😂😊
The lightning edit when he sings "My life was a storm since I was born" makes it so powerful
It's naturally beautiful   Hvala vam,merçi,thank you very mooch, vielen dank, muchas gracias,eucharisto 🥀
Decades and decades of brilliant songs by various bands and artists and yet this song has captured my heart in a different way.
“My life was a storm since I was born. How could I fear any hurricane?”   Sir. Every song has crippled me in the best possible way but this?? Takes the cake.
Wow!
slayed
🧡🧡
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
.
There’s something desperately beautiful about choosing all the hardship that comes with living, just because a single moment with a loved one is worth it.
nem feliz nem triste feliste, mds essa musica me destruiu kkkkkkkkkkk
Most of all, the level of consciousness of the community that Hozier was able to create around himself is striking. It's like moths searching for light around a lantern.
love this ❤
Belleza divina de canción y vídeo
I know this is a masterpiece that is ripping all of our hearts out, but can we also please appreciate how beautiful his nose looks in this whole video?
Francesca it's just the title.
siempre superandose, como amo al artista y cada nueva cancion que sale, una obra de arte
💕
Im now convinced he puts drugs into his songs
I know it's a silly one... but he's so handsome 🥹❤
I can't wait to hear this live in July 😭
Needs an acoustic version. I hate overproduced music. Dont like the double tracking and sharp guitar power chords. Beautiful music and song writing. The band is amazing.
Oh my GOD. You killed it man
This might be my favorite song off 2023 this far <3
This song is a banger, thanks for existing Hozier 🔥
This is a real masterpiece... I'm crying.
🤍
Soul speech, the language of music, of true music.... So beautiful...so powerful...
Obviously, I'm going to listening to the song for 5-6 times a day for a month :D but can we appreciate also the director Anthony Byrne
...BRIVIDI...
Alguém faz esse álbum acontecer 🥹 Que música meus amigos! 💕🇧🇷
This song is impeccable in vibe, melody, lyrics, and bass. It's also giving me Dolores O'Riordan vibes, and I mean that as a great compliment. It's gonna be a while before I can listen to it workout crying, I think, for personal reasons.  This man's music almost always hits me in the soul. Legend.
It's way more emotional when you know the song's Divine Comedy reference.
Whirlwind of a lifetime. What an experience life is … I would probably do it all over again, too. Beautiful song. Thank you, Hozier. ❤
0:36 and 1:04 are my favorite parts
te quiero mucho
Am I the only one who hears "pureful"?
I LOVE THIS SONG
I’m watching this video again just watching everybody perform and I just want to see what the behind the scenes was like bc I love that kind of stuff, I really hope we get another tour themed music video !
His voice, the lyrics, the rhythm, beat and energy. Perfect, i love it!!
If "Eat your young" was Feysand song, this one is Nessian. Cheers to my book fellas #acotar #acosf
Obbbseeeeeesssseeedd
how can a song be so healing and heartbreaking at the same time
This song will go down in history
very sad to see hozier begin to make bland pop-rock music  hopefully the rest of unreal unearth isnt like this song :(
I wish i could i find the love that francesca and Paolo had. Willing to go to hell for eachother

Пойдет.
Sound of music 0.36 very awesome oh i love it. 😍😍😍😍
Feel like there's a really strong Cranberries influence for this. Absolutely spectacular.
Is it just me or can anyone hear Dolores O'Riordan also singing this Cranberries style?
I am so speechless.  A beautiful waterfall of sounds.  This music elevates you to another place. Wow.........
Put me back in, coach
putz, TE AMO HOZIER, EU TE AMO, apenas te amo. beijos, te amo!
This song takes me back to 1994, on a Space Shuttle to Mars leaving Las Cruces New Mexico, while the world falls in love.
I love this songggggg, and as a fan of inferno it’s so refreshing to see this title in reference to the tale of Francesca, canto 5 is one of my favourite pieces
THANK YOU HOZIER! ❤❤❤❤
Ramona, if somehow you find this comment. I want to kiss you while we both cry, I loved our tragic t4t wlw relationship.
The world needed this ❤
Thank you so much for your music
love it. thankyou Hozier.
A power ballad from the past and it’s so great
i wanna have this tattoed in my brain please and thank you
❤😊
I lost my best friend & chosen sister of 15 years a little over two months ago. This song hits me in a way that few things can. We grew together and went through so many ups and downs, we chose eachother as family and there's nothing I would change about any of it. I love and miss you, Cookie. 🖤
Am I the only one getting Dolores O'Riordan vibes starting 2:35 (it kinda reminded me of "Linger")?
Hozier, I’m so blessed to have gotten a ticket for Malahide gig, my first time being lucky enough to get a ticket and I have never been So excited. This song, oh my god, thanks for touching my soul yet again king 🙌🏼 never been so excited for a gig in my life
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
trully a master piece❤❤❤❤❤❤
Believe me when I say it feels like I've been listening to this song my whole life, like it was just always a part of my soul but simply slept there the whole time before sprouting now (it does in fact feel like a tree is bursting through my chest every time I listen to it)
Sensacional
my soul flew out of my body with this one.
Greatest love song written?
Un minuto de silencio para los que no han descubierto esta voz
What I love about this song's incredible artistry is that Hoizer based it on a real-life tragic love affair. Francesca da Rimini (d. 1283-1286), was married to Giovanni Malatesta ("The Lame"), but had a decade-long relationship with his younger brother, Paolo. Giovanni found out and killed them both. Dante knew of the lovers from Francesca's nephew and put them in his "Inferno." Thus, Hozier's song is probably from the perspective of Paolo, who extols his undying love for her, consequences be damned.
After reading all of the comments, all I can say is, exactly!
I've made peace with the possibility that I may never love a man the way I do this one
1:02 😢❤❤❤❤
I love the video being 4:44
Hozier makes gloriously intuitive and radiant, heart-centred music. Francesca calls out to the soul and gifts the strength of a love that invigorates and raptures humanity. This bold unwavering love warrants a destination amongst the stars.
I love that this music video is so different from Hozier's other videos that feature somewhat of a storyline and other visual aspects to complement the song. The live performance of this song is powerful and visceral enough that it needs nothing but Hozier and his band to drive home the emotional aspects straight to the viewer's heart. Truly can't wait for the new album.
love this song still gives the chills..
Absolutely incredible.
I love this. Something about it gives me a sense of strength and determination.
Thank you for writing songs about Afra girls too! With the willow hair! I play your music every time I am looking in the mirror like yes my willow does float on air and only a Afra girl could make hozier write a love song like this 🤧💕💕💖
I cannot sing this song I am trying to learn the lyrics but I am filled with tears. My fiancé who is also a Pisces like Hozier  actually broke up with me a few months ago because he had a unexpected family emergency happened and had to sort his financials out. I saw a tear come out of his eye and he didn’t want me to look at him. He felt ashamed. So I could just imagine what it would be like if I stayed with him. He knew that I required a man that would provide and protect me or else I would lose respect for him as a lady. His dad called me to say the same thing and how my fiancé needs to focus on himself, he was shocked when I was actually agreeing with him. When my fiancé was ready he told me how much he missed me and how he has been working hard everyday and thinking about our future. I felt relieved to see that he was a man of his words and loved how thoughtful he was to not put me into a uncomfortable position which is so attractive to me. This song is like he is singing to me like haha did you really think I wouldn’t be able to come back with a boom 💥 😭💖
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I love it , 💘 special song 🤩
Hozier’s music is the perfect soundtrack for movies
i'm sorry 😭 i don't think the song is bad and it starts so well and makes you want to hear it all  but there is something that bothers me and i think it's how "violent" (i can't find a better word lol) it's gradually getting by the end because i like 'soft' hozier music more lol but once again the song is not bad! it's just me :/
I love you, Andrew!!!!!
🏳️‍🌈🥰
Last year was rough for many reasons, mainly due to the fact that my mental health was horrible and left unchecked. I was at such a low point that I tried to take my own life. Now I’m slowly but surely healing, and with each song Hozier has released this year I feel myself heal just a little bit more. Hozier has been a major part of my life since the self-titled album and his music has helped me through so much. I’m so grateful an artist like him exists ❤
😢you are different okay
❤❤❤ . . 👇 *You’re amazing...Hope everyone finds inner peace*
😭😭❤❤❤❤
te amo <3
Hozier never disappoints! Beautiful! ❤️🇨🇦
Un vídeo que se siente como regresar a los 00's!!!! Amé la canción!!!!!
the best part about having had an education in the classics is that i can get hozier's allusions on the first go.
i love it, this sound is fucking crazy man 😍😍❤❤
🥰🥰🥰

Jesus is coming soon. he who died for our sins on the cross, let us love one another, keep his words and his commandments❤❤
A masterpiece.
Te quiero mucho hozier los mortales no te merecen
Es genial porque logra transmitir intensidad y sutileza al mismo tiempo no se, senti fuerza y poder en e video
Outro goes crazy
necesito saber cuando viene a argentina asi voy buscando comprador para uno de mis riñones jajaja COMO LO AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tremendous... So layered! A Rig Rundown would be grand too. This might be the best directed/filmed performance video I have seen. Congrats to the director/band!
Nice song but the lyrics take me absolutely nowhere except back to trying to figure out what they are trying to accomplish musically.
My life was a storm since I was born How could I fear any hurricane?  OMG!!!
Hozier wtf is these lyrics 😭😭 im crying 😔😔
He sings my soul, my savior... How great thou art
"If someone asked me at the end,I'd tell them put me back in it.."  This month would have been my 7th wedding anniversary. But she left, I'd do it again. Better for my part. But this song hits hard this time of year. Glad I found it
Quickly becoming my favorite HOZIER song…xxx
i wish to get back to her again..
the mv is 4:44 long
Lyrics   Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)

Amazing song
With my mom we share the joy of enjoying Andrew's music all the time. While we tidy up our garden, while we cook or while we simply spend time in each other's company. As soon as she heard this song when it was released she fell in love and it has been on repeat in our home for the last few days. It makes me immensely happy. Thank you Andrew, once again, for delivering such pure and rare art to us.
I can't stop listening 🎧
❤
❤❤❤❤
❤
❤
Someone just put me back in it n I would do it again
❤
❤
If I could hold you for a minute, I would do it again
Ahhhh!!! YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN, HOZIER!!!
The last minute is so fucking amazing. Literally sounds like what you’d hear when you make it to heaven and your loved ones and past pets are at the gates welcoming you.
not this song releasing when I'm having to study Dante's Inferno for uni 🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️
Stoopid jebus
How does Hozier constantly puts out such amazing songs? I need to know! This is a master piece, a work of art for the centuries!
Listening isn't enough. I need this song to inhabit my body and devour me from within.
Sounds big is that a result of the empty space or type of walls?
I just read about Francesca and Paolo love story. And now this hits even harder...
Bro is beautiful
Y el collab con florence para cuando? :/
It's a magnetic beauty and Hozier is a cook. 😉 Let's get chemical.  He has formula of  love and every deadly sin. His soup consists stuff like dance: testosterone, estrogen,  attraction; dopamine, norepinephire, serotonin, attachment: oxytocin, vasopressin. Let Him Cook.🖤 i am not done yet, waiting here patiently while listening his set, a song of true love. ✨🤍
Amazing song and video. Very inspiring for us other artists in Ireland. Cheers man ✊
Gives me Cranberry vibes - Irish icons
I'm not crying. You're crying.
💓
like on one hand this song references song of achilles to me but on the other hadn there are so many stories with "my life has been disastrous, i have met you and i love you and i will love you and id do it all again to love you again and in death ill know you and the next life i will know you" cause now im thinking about Orpheus and eurydice and tomorrow i will remember two more lovers fated and doomed
i cannot express how close to my heart this song hits, i have not heard ONE song out of this mans mouth that i havent fallen in love with. i would do ANYTHING to see him live Unreal Unearth is going to destroy me in the best way
Sometimes i ask myself if hozier never made a music i could starving in my whole to something i don't know what is it , i would never feel The Satiety
How can anybody write so beautifully?! Love this so much.
Que música! Quantos sentimentos…
you never miss. ever. honored to be in the same timeline as you.
I am digging the vibe. Hozier is the only musician who never disappoints.
Շատ լավ  երգ ա։
This song is simply incredible. I've been listening to it on repeat for the past few days and each time i enjoy it even more than before.
the outro my god
Love
I love this song, it gives me 90s rock vibes, even reminds me of the cranberries a bit, spectacular!
God Of War Ragnarok brought me here!
Francesca of Divine Comedy, brought to life by Hozier, this is amazing ❤️
😮 from somebody who was 14 years old in 1990 and was immersed in magic, this guy is legit
SUCH A MASTERPIECE!!! Words can't explain what I'm feeling right now, I thought I was prepared but I guess we will never be
The everlasting ink from your heart ❤️
Thanks heavens the video doesn’t have a narrative… so everyone can have their own interpretation.
🤎🤎🤎
La canzone più bella di sempre
The most incredible outro
Hoziers ability to use the music of the instrument and back up singers to resonate your core while his voice penetrates so deep into your mind and soul that you lose time when his music plays. 🙌👏👏 masterclass
He's done it again. I've had this song stuck in my head all day. It's catchy but deep. The versatility and meaning of his music is why Hozier has been my favorite singer for a decade. Now, please add some Ohio dates to your tour. The last time i was able to attend a show was in Nov of 2019 at the Akron Civic Theater, a few weeks before my mom passed.
Thank you God. And Hozier
What's the song talking about
AMEEEII!!! 🤩🤩
Idk how he does it but he definitely does it every single time. 🫶🏾❤️‍🩹
I’ve been listening to this song at least once a day since it came out…one of my favorites by far. Thank you so much Hozier
I like everything Hozier does. But this song took my heart out of my chest. I can no longer live normally, I wake up early morning to listen. I think I'm heading straight for Dante's Fifth Circle of Hell, Wrath. How can you? How can someone have this power to write something that hits the emotions so violently? Hozier, you are not of this world. Slainté!
He's super aware of the world we're living in and the brutality of it all, he's someone who actually cares, it's really hard to find an artist like him nowadays ❤
So badly wish he actually said my name in the song- but knowing what it’s actually about it is so mind blowing.
Only,take me to......🌎🕶️
3:35 the chills!!!! GOD
This song came out right before my breakup, my ex and I were huge fans and listened to it together. Now that she's gone the lyrics hit a lot harder, but it's for the best.  Thank you Hozier
Nice to have a song named after you-
Great times to be named Francesca 🫶🫶🫶
GREAT 🔥✨
Not loving any of his new songs with this album. I want to hear his voice not the band over powering him. Can't even understand what he's saying in this song.
Love the song, but don't like the video, I expected something more artsy like the Movement video, especially considering the Dante's divine comedy meaning behind it.
Mein Gott, I love this man with all my heart.
It sounds like Hozier, that's what I like 😊
No puedo con todo lo que me hace sentir está canción. Es simplemente mágico, una felicidad y unas ganas de seguir adelante despues de esa relación que hasta la fecha estoy sanando.  Me sentia mal por creer que perdí el tiempo, pero poco a poco me di cuenta que hubo cosas buenas, lo malo me hace aprender sobre mí y lo que quiero, con ayuda de esta canción puedo decir que si, si regresara el tiempo volveria a tomar ese camino y aunque fuera con la mentalidad que tengo ahora... Definitivamente el cielo no esta listo para nuestro amor.  Muchas gracias Hozier y a todo tu equipo por hacer magia con la música.
Omg he filmed this where I work and I had no idea 😭
Currently in hospital with my mum who has cancer. This song resonates so well and is really something. Finding it hard to describe with human words the emotions we are feeling, but this comes really close.
"heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I" I AM GOING TO SCREAM
This is one of my hozier favoritessss😍😍😍😍
i am pregnant.
oh Hozier 🥹
Touchée en plein coeur.
wow
SUPER❤
i love u hozier <3
brb getting my name legally changed to francesca so that i can gaslight myself into believing im his muse
3:33 is that yoshi?😀
I wish I could call you "my husband". Simply perfect, as always. I love each one of your songs. And I would still be surprised if i could find you in any life! Love you 💙
An ad was still playing and I already hit Like. That's how much I trust that I'd ove whatever this man puts out.
Engagement
боже, как он хорош
Another song from Hozier that gets me on a trance, thank you!
That's so perfect, I loved❤❤
he is perfect ❤
I will never recover
Fantastico
This man is like…TOO good. It’s honestly suspicious 🤨
Bellísimo
i want this song tattooed on my brain
The passion in this song is overwhelming and all encompassing. It’s on a loop in my brain all the time right now.
Every release has been incredible! Can't wait to hear the album in full!!!
3 words: chills, chills and chills 🔥
Amazing as always 🤌🏼🥺💖
Flawless 🤌
THE OMINOUS VIBE OF THE VIDEO COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT FOR THE SONG.   LIKE, WE ALL KNOW SOMETHING BAD WAS GONNA HAPPEN BUT IT WAS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL WE STAYED.
Another name that's not mine
This is gold.💜💜💜 the lyrics make me cry. I love it.
Wow, that is an experience. Beautifully shot, so much voice and music magic happening at the same time. Loved the song. Thank you for the soulful music!
Just  * wow * !
I simply...love this song
God I cannot even understand how Hozier does it. He creates such beautiful stories and puts them to beautiful music. He’s a genius
YES 🖤 If this is a glimpse at the new album, it's gonna be phenomenal.
❤❤❤
Do you think that its a coincidence that this video comes on the first day of pride month or am I reading too much
Τι υπέροχη δίνη από ηλεκτρισμό και φωνές!
My boyfriend and I fell in love because of Hozier's songs, and this song has come at the perfect time for us - because we're both going to different universities and will most likely break up - but I would do it again every time. Idk what kinda magic Hozier has to release perfect songs at perfect times, but I'm so grateful for him.
The whole song is so full of sound and complexity, and grabs the mind body and soul in so many ways. I will listen again, and with chills every time
I used to think, that I fell in love with Hozier's music cause of first album.  But no, all this time I was just waiting for Unreal Unearth. Thank you, Andrew, for turning our feelings into music
This is just what the soul needed. 🤍
This song makes me cry in an uncontrollable manner every. single. time because of the profound feelings it conveys! 😭 From the first time I listened it became my favourite musical piece. 💗🥺
the Attack on Titan sticker 🤍
Oh my god 🫀
I loved this song right away, and this passionate performance is beyond stunning.
I would do anything to watch this live, for now it’ll just play on repeat.
August is too far Hozier 😟
Thank you king ❤
This song made me nearly wreck my car I was sobbing so hard. I had to pull over and cry at how beautiful the sentiments were. Well done, sir.
feels so weird sharing a name with this song, but that wont stop me from loving this masterpiece and all its meanings and messages
Unbelievable 😢
Hozier you look so beautiful with this new hairstyle
this is art!
So good, once more another great song that hits straight to the soul.
i cannot help but tear up everytime this song is played... love your art Hozier, sending all good wishes on your way !!!
This song is so beautiful. Especially after going through a breakup with someone I thought that I would be with forever (because who doesn’t think that, right?). Something about this song just encapsulates the love I have, the feeling of that pain and amplifying it into something that is beautiful and precious—and really never-ending and bigger than the heavens.
How can he sing these lyrics in a way it makes my heart melt.. how does he do it??? Thank God I live in the same era as him🥺❤️❤️
Beautiful song! Always loved Hozier. Such a gorgeous man ❣️
❤❤❤❤
Your music heals brother 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Obsessed doesn’t begin to describe my love for this song
I need this injected into my bloodstream
Incredible 💞 it's a masterpiece
I've said it before and I will say it again: Andrew is truly the T.S Elliot, the William Butler Yeats of our generation. I have been listening to Hozier since I was a freshman in high school and I just graduated college a week ago! I just got dumped after 2 years together and I have no clue what I am going to do with my life. But this music helps me ride the waves as they come. From the bottom of my heart, I owe this man a lot and I am so grateful for his existence.
Hozier wanted all the lesbians to start the pride month happy
"Heaven is not fit to house a love, like you and I"....gosh these beautiful lyrics😭
I love you, Hozier. Thank u for this master piece ❤
im not okay.
Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)
Some of the lines in the song .. I'm not sure what he says. But that's not the point - it's the feeling it gives me. That warm, sweet happiness 🙂🤗 great track
You deserve the heaven ❤
Man. This fucking guy. Unbelievable.
I love the chaotic editing and cinematography during the chorus! All of the whirling glimpses and flashes of light really feel to me like being in a hurricane. And the band looks great! It's nice to see everyone get some screen time ❤
Even though unfortunately me and my daughter's mother haven't been able to figure things out, atleast she introduced me to this man. Just hearing his voice makes me get teary eyed lol. Ugh! He doesn't miss.
DAAARLIN😭😭🤍
ok mister Andrew, Hozier, sir? ya'll need to stop tearing my guts out with each new songs. Theres' only so many feet/meters left of intestines in my current body ok.  y como dice tito el bambino ~dios los bendiga clo clo
I Can’t Help But Imagine Being Loved By A Voice So Sweet 😸🫶🏼
Hozier made me question life with his song "All things end". After hearing this, I won't anymore.
3:25 is what it sounds like when you go to heaven
Such an energetic music voice  I love you Hozier
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Absolutely wonderful 🖤🖤
what a beautiful video and what emotions come to me when listening to this piece of music. How beautiful is the love you put into all your songs and how beautiful is the message you convey as an artist. Thanks for sharing your art with us.
holi
This song can already become a post-rock progressive album. I wasn't expecting a breakdown with surreal out-of-body experience.
i'm the 9998th likes, just 2 more away from 10k
Love it 😇. Beautiful lyrics.
This song is nothing but the thoughts of people - made into a beautiful melody- who've lost their loved ones.  It's heartbreaking but you can't really help yourself from playing it again and again. Hoping, maybe, listening to it might send out a message to the universe, to your lost-loved ones, that they are being missed, that they never faded from your memories.
OMG AAAAAAAA
Amazing just brilliant
This song gives me Cranberries vibes in the best way possible, what a work of art. Hozier simply does not miss
3:22 has to be Hozier's sex face.
I love you tall man.
It’s so amazing to see Hozier in a more rock-style music video. This song is so raw and powerful I love it
I wanna inject this song directly into my brain
❤❤❤
Simply, WOW!!!
This is GORGEOUS.
I’m probably old enough to be his grandmother but I surely love Hozier’s music. As for Francesca, having lost the most dear person in my life, I would say “put me back in it” but for me, heaven is the only place fit for the love invested experienced.
thank you for writing such morbidly, tragically, beautiful music. your music has helped me deal with my grief and i cannot thank you enough ❤
WHAT THE FUCK!
Why is he soooo criminally underrated??? 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I just got cheated on recently and I will now be drowning myself in hozier music only 🖤
I need more than one like button, it's so not enough for this song.
This song has such a high vive that it gives me goosebumps 💜
Não acredito no inferno. Francesca e Paolo devem estar agora dançando no paraíso ouvindo isso ❤
Every Hozier song comes to my life in the right moment. It's the first time I'm able to listen to his songs when he releases them and each one had healed me with its music and lyrics. And I say this because some of his old songs (as No Plan or Nina Cried Power) only came when I was in need of their messages, even though  it had been months since they were published ❤ That's why I'm always gonna love you, Hozier. You're my safe place in this crazy life I'm living. Right now, the new tracks are helping me to overcome the loss of my dad, who passed away last December. Also, you're teaching me the need of changes, the beauty of life despite the moments of sadness and the possibility of loving love. I'm young, but sometimes I also feel lost. I guess that's why your music its so important to me. Besides, I'm a writer, so your poetic lyrics are an example for me to follow. Greetings from Venezuela ❤❤❤❤❤ You're the best ✨
I'm feeling like Dante crying over their tragic love story, beautiful lyrics and meaning!!!
my best friend lost her battle with her 4th bout with cancer last fall. her husband is so lost without her. this song just pulls out all those memories. the voice is perfect.
How am i going to survive until august?
Hozier might just be Orpheous personified
I missed you
If/when they make a movie of a court of thorns and roses, this song BETTER be on the soundtrack!
Feels like stepping out of some house of worship each time 🤘🏼 Great song, brilliant video 🙌🏻🔥
I’m in love with this song and I love how everyone can relate to it from their own experiences
hozier seems to really love old warehouses or something bro
Wow. That was. Wow just wow im still in shock I'm never not put in a trance by all your videos
Did his brother direct this?!?!!!?!
Thank you for the music, Hozier
✌🏾🧡
Best song on the album so far
🥰🥰🥰 Love it!!!
his songs really grow on you after a couple listens
Hey queen! Girl, you have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. I’d say I’m surprised, but I know who you are.
1:04  love ❤
Every time I listen to Andrew's voice, since his first and second albums came out, he pours out his emotions through his lyrics. You feel overwhelmed with so much going on in the world that you just want to  pause and hit play to let his songs saturate your heart, mind, and soul. I hope his 3rd album will take the world by storm when it's released soon. God bless you, Andrew, and thank you for bringing the wonderful vocal talent to our ears. Truly amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
god everything hozier is putting out is a reminder of how enthralled i am with him. I'm going to see him live on july and i think this might be the first time i truly feel starstruck
It could be more perfect?! Yes... If was called "Juliana". Please, come to Brazil,  as soon as you can❤
just got off graveyard shift and good morning
this song repeatedly brings me to my knees
This. This is music. This needs to be what we hear on the radio. It's meaningful, it's poetic, it's high quality. It's music
Uauuuu, simplesmente  visceral!
Love the ending
Hozier you are a total master,  idk why your songs make me feel like I was the protagonist of some movie and your songs were my main theme (sorry for bad english btw, im not native, but this deserved an epic comment)
This song .. this man.. gives me hope for humanity . Thank you for such an incredible journey with you Hozier .. the love, energy and brilliance you pour into your art is simply life giving … I am so grateful for you and the chance to hear this magic! My daughter says to hear hoziers voice is like your eardrums being kissed .. I agree 💖 please keep creating
Woa, nice song!
I hope Andrew knows the depth of his soul-crushing and heart-soaring poetic lyricism because by god, I am stunned to speechlessness at the sheer beauty of his writing and emotion every single time he releases anything
This song and album are absolutely gorgeous. Francesca is definitely a new favourite song along with Eat Your Young, and I’m sure there will be even more favourites in the Unreal Unearth album as it continues to be released.   I also just want to voice that I appreciate Hozier so much as an artist. His music has truly gotten me through hard times like right now with the current attack on the queer community in the U.S., especially as a queer, trans person myself. This album and Hozier’s music as a whole has given me so much hope and a reason to continue going right now.   Anyway, have a good day everyone! ❤️
you can't imagine how much i wish he comes for a concert in Greece.
This song provoques somethingbin me that only very few pieces of art do. I love this nearly as much as Take me to Church, and that‘s a special one!
Crying screaming throwing up... How is he so skilled at creating heartfelt masterpieces?
What's wrong with you? Do you have to be this GOOD? All I can do for a couple of days is cry over this masterpiece.
I really wanted a storyline for this song but I'm not complaining since Hozier and everyone in the band are looking so gorgeous 😔✌🏻
Couldn't help but smile
Love this song a lot! Thanks for sharing the vid, the last part gave me goosebumps.
I'm so ready for the album!
a master piece
Absolutely awesome.  Francesca is the most viscerally powerful song Hozier has done since Jackie and Wilson.  Major classic rock U2 vibes; the rhythm section sounds like Larry and Adam.  The setting and lightning really enhance the vibe.  Dear God, please let me find a ticket to his show!  🙏 💙 😢
Francesca / Lyrics Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily?

This song brings tears to my eyes. It's so beautiful 😭❤️
what a fucking great song
Love how there isn’t a real story or theme to the video because the performance of the group is entertaining enough to stand by itself. Incredible job Hozier. Your team is impeccable!
❤❤❤
awesome atmosphere and lights... and totally amazing band. and of course I am in love with this song from its first premiere
Rlly impressed by everything you create. I feel like Unreal Unearth is gonna heal and kill me at one time. The music video like a song itself is a breathtaking masterpiece. I listen to it and cry. I'm literally crying after watching this, and I'm going to watch it again and again. Tank you
I love when you make books references 😢 in general i love all your music
I don't have a sad story to tell, so this won't make it to the top comments, but the effort is always worth it.
The lyrics cut deep on this one.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
May 31st Francesca🎤🎼💯. One of unreal unearth's best
I don’t think his accent has ever been as present in his music as it is in this song😂💜
Finally some good music video from Hozier. I didn't like the other two but this one is good enough. This song though, I have it on repeat since it was released 🖤
Please don't do that Hozier😢
Gracias a los chicos y a ti en especial Andrew, gracias por tanto ❤
a voz desse homem mds q perfeição
Nossa é muito boa!
This is a massive missed opportunity of a video. Generic 'band play their instruments in a warehouse'. You can do so much better than this, and the visuals should be as good as what is an exceptional song.
like its ok but idk can you just release a studio version of blood
Insanely beautiful
Mds hozier eu te amo❤❤😭😭
who hurt him and can they do it again
these songs just keep getting better and better, the album is gonna be perfection
i can’t wait to experience this live
what’s up with the green caterpillar thing
Dante would have been proud.
This is the third day this song is on repeat for me , crazy work hozier love u
Unreal Unearth is gonna be, well, unreal when it releases. So powerful.
Che meraviglia ❤
❤❤❤
chills
I'm completely in love with this Hozier's new era ❤ /Love from 🇧🇷
This video is so simple yet I can't seem to get enough of it. My eyes are glued on the screen. Amazing work.
The ending is absolutely brilliant ❤❤🔥🔥
90s angst
Cara de trilha sonora de filme, de novo Holzier e esses arranjos.
PERFECT!!! Thnaks for sahring ypur art with us, Andrew, you're amazing!!! 💜🤘👏👏👏
My name is Francesca this is such an honour 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
thank you for helping me cope vvith life and death
Lowkey crushing hard on Alex in this video
I'm gonna scream
Caramba me arrepiei toda aqui.  Ficou maravilhosa. Te amo Andrew 💖
seeing this song preformed live healed me of anything wrong ever and broke me at the same time chills the entire time
Nice 😁to have you👀 back👇 Music Angel's One's 🤲
I love this video. It reminds me so much of late 90s/early to mid 2000s rock music video, regarding the set, the camera angles and the general vibes. Just a guy and his band rocking out in an abandoned warehouse, barn or in the middle of a street. Anybody get what I'm saying?
this song touches so many broken parts of me
the little green dinosaur on the soundmixer 🥺
Perdutamente innamorata della voce di quest'uomo!
Hozier ❤️‍🔥🤟🏻
stunningly beautiful
hozier really is out there releasing amazing songs like it's nothing huh
❤
i actually felt someone shove their hand through my chest, dig for my heart, and grip it harder by the second (courtesy of how everyone played through this video)
This man is a genius, i love him so much
IM IN LOVE ONCE AGAIN
GET INTO MY STORM PLEASEEEEEE
I AM ASCENDING
Absolutely stunning!
İlk dinlediğim andan beri başa sarıp sarıp dinliyorum. Yine çok güzel yine çok etkileyici 🥲
if he doesnt play this at the nashville concert im gonna lose it😭😭😭😭
SICK I TELL YOU HOW DARE YOU RELEASE SUCH A MASTERPIECE OMDS, LOVE YA MAN. WHAT A VOICE, WHAT. A. VOICE.
hozier wtf 😭❤️
Hozier is a talented, gifted, emotionionally raw musician! One of the ALL time greats! Thank you for the music young man❤
Absolute banger as always 😎
Love is worth becoming mortal for. ❤
🎵 😥 Beautiful 🔥🎵
Great song Listened to it more than100 times❤❤❤❤❤
Oh WOW!
@hozier my name is sasha, for future references
That is a song for a good morning! Love it!
This man lives and breathes ART 🤍!
Me pone tan feliz cuando Hozier sube canciones diosmio
What a great song. Cheers🥂🥂
AAAAAGHHH
This was amazing
Mi apoyo y admiración desde mi pequeño pueblito Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, México ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ #minovio 😅❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
oh my god absolute chills. fuckin amazing
Hozier is a literary genius. His songs must be written down in textbooks,  learnt by heart, recited during gatherings, thought upon on rainy days and ugly cried during the darkness of the nights.
i just know the ending of this song live is going to be my undoing.
lesbians wake up hozier posted
Why does he want me to cry?
Beautiful
Huge fan of Hozier, the song is amazing, but this video should come with an epileptic seizure warning lol. Gave me a headache just to watch. I really liked the end, however, when the choir and chorus mesh, it slowed down and felt like a much more intimate video, like watching a concert from the stage.
Art is how we decorate space, music is how we decorate time ❤️
Hozier makes my heart feel a special kind of heard
I tear up everytime I hear this song. The lyrics are so beautiful along with Hozier’s amazing voice, my heart can’t take it. 🥹❤️
omggggg
he's insane for this
Masterpiece. Breathtaking masterpiece ❤
I love it ❤❤
Kenya rep
I LOVE YOU <3
Omg love thisss!!!!!
I'm sure this is gonna be the best album of the year!
Poetic, bittersweet and simply beautiful. Hozier is too good for this world 🥺😭
Genuinely speechless
Non ho parole, Hozier... ti sei superato per quanto il tuo livello fosse già altissimo... congratulazioni ❤
3:33 best part
Oh Hozier, no one else gets into my head at the exact moment I need them to like you! Amazing! ❤ You did it again! 👏
This is a "go through it again, put me back again, do it again" (loop me) kind of song.
The darker sides of Hozier are what gets me…love the color in this mv, wonder if he will get darker in a few more songs but if not there’s always Sleep Token to satiate…they both reference Dante’s Divine Comedy, Eden, Dore’s Empyrean, disembodiment (missing limbs), all consuming emotions as cannibalism etc.
this video and the song are beautiful. I'm sobbing. I'm so excited that I get to see him live in October, I can't wait.
Oh Andrew... 🥺Y you make me feel a lot of things in my messy heart 🖤 you are my soft spot✨
So Thankful for you and your music Andrew! I had the pleasure of seeing you live at the Shaky Knees Festival with my Dad, it was a beautiful moment that I will forever hold close to my heart!!!<3
At 3:17 close your eyes. Thank you for  a wonderful lunch.
I'm so excited for the album after getting a peek at all these tracks. Preordered and counting down the days!
Beautiful 🥹
I feel like Hozier's music comes out every time I am feeling down or overwhelmed. And each time his songs become my only companion. Crying to his songs, singing along as loudly as I can, or just sitting under the shower, his songs have never stopped accompanying me.
" woo~hooo! "
If I were half as skilled and beautiful as this man, I'd be very lucky indeed.
🔥🔥🔥😍🤩😍💐💐💐
el mejor y punto
Amazing, I love this song and I'd love to hear it live, please, come to Brazil! 🇧🇷
Would've loved a flash warning.
I’m sooooo close to writing a Hozier fanfic man, brb creating a Wattpad account XD
Very very good
actually a masterpiece
His voice, the lyrics, the rhythm, beat and energy. I love this song 🤍
Perfect❤❤
I'm watching this on two different devices at once. 🫣
I love u hozier
Transfixed. That's it. 💜💜💜💜💜
Do you think I'd give up That this might've shook the love from me Or that I was on the brink? How could you think, darling, I'd scare so easily? Now that it's done There's not one thing that I would change My life was a storm, since I was born How could I fear any hurricane? If someone asked me at the end I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah For all that was said Of where we'd end up at the end of it When the heart would cease Ours never knew peace What good would it be on the far side of things? It was too soon When that part of you was ripped away A grip taking hold Like a cancer that grows Each piece of your body that it takes Though I know my heart would break I'll tell them put me back in it Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I'd go through it again, ah, ah I would still be surprised I could find you, darling In any life If I could hold you for a minute Darling, I would do it again, ah, ah I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I) I would not change it each time (I would not change it each time) Heaven is not fit to house a love (Heaven is not fit to house a love) Like you and I (like you and I)
Thank you for your beautiful music
gay people when hozier 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
This song is so monumental
god, these lyrics make me cry so much.
Un deleite siempre escucharte 🥺💖
THE LIL DINOSAUR 😭😭😭
Vibe❤
no miss brrrr
It really sounds like ascending to another dimension. ✨💕
good content
Love the raw feel❤ Hozier never disappoints.
Lovely song and video, but my favorite part was the close up of the little green dinosaur on the keys.
i love this man’s brain. his lyrics honestly make my soul light up.
I get goosebumps everytime i hear this. What a song!!
BARS???
Amééé 💛
This song is indescribable, what great music is supposed to be like
This song is so moving. I’m currently bawling my eyes out thinking about the love of my life and how i just simply want him to hold me. we have been through so much together and he still chooses me everyday. he is such a beautiful soul and every love song Hozier releases makes me cry happy tears
Fantastic video and better the song¡¡¡¡¡
I love it, brother. 🤟💀
hell ya baby
oh to be a fly on the wall hearing hozier sing live. 👁️👄👁️
I like all the instruments in the rock vibe.  Love the lyrics so sweet.  But then awkwardly smashed together😢
ambassin 😩
Hozier makes me think maybe cloning is ok... just this one time...
always so beautiful
Oh my God! That's my Hozier! Perfection! What a rockin awesome song. Greatness!  Oct I have tickets! Longest wait ever! Worth it! ❤❤❤
This is so beautiful. This video really captures the feeling of powerful love and yearning that I feel in this song ❤️
i like to think this song is an ode to francesca da rimini from dante’s “inferno”. one of the first souls damned in hell for infidelity, she described her actions as succumbing to love, whether one would like to consider that as an agent of sin or not. fate being unfair & unjust to all parties involved, francesca “would do it again” to hold her lover again.
Yet again, he does it 😊
Wake up babe new Hozier vid just dropped
SOUND THE ALARMS!!! HOZIER MUSIC VIDEO!!!
Well we all know this is gonna be amazing
I so love this song Hozier & crew  video’s awesome  💕
IM%>×>3^1<#9× AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHQ IM BLOWING UP OH MY GODDDDD
i thank everything that led me to hear and see this beautiful thing
I had a loved one pass on Saturday, and singing along to this song, for the past few days, has been surprisingly cathartic. Between good music, good comfort food, and good friends, I'm doing better than I had initially thought I would be. Sometimes peace comes naturally, sometimes we have to create it for ourselves, and right now I'm dealing with the latter, so I'm grateful to have this song to sing along with- despite the fact that I butcher it bad enough to be considered parody.
So beautiful ❤️🌹💖
Gonna be Album of the Year
A beautiful depiction of a storm inside and outside.
SOTY!!!!!
Once again Hozier shows us the beauty that is his mind
Oh my my my :')
This song has altered my brain chemistry. I love it so much, holy fuck
Always the best! Greetings from Bulgaria! ❤
I have canceled all of my plans for tonight just so I could watch the video on my big screen when it got released 😅 No regrets. So worth it. 😍
My God. So much to say, but I feel like we're seeing a full lean into Hozier's own personal style. The storm raging outside pays homage to the song. The scene inside is dirty, gritty, animalistic, raw, cathartic, and builds into a perfect storm of voices for Dante's lovers to swirl around forever in. Absolutely gorgeous video.
HERE!
Amazing, showstopping, phenomenal, i have no words, im in awe, Hozier, thank you
Just perfect ❤
Meraviglia ❤❤❤❤
My brother just lost his battle with cancer and life has been heartbreaking. All of Hozier’s new songs (and his old ones too) have been so therapeutic for me these past months. Francesca turns me into an absolute puddle, but gives me hope at the same time. I’m so thankful for you, Andrew 🫶🏻 thank you for sharing your talent with all of us and for getting us through some tough times in our lives. You are a bigger deal than you know!
É um reizinho mesmo 😍 incrível ❤❤❤
Beautiful ❤
It’s simple but so effective. HE HITS IT OUTTA THE PARK EVERY TIME😭😭😭
Beautiful song, beautiful video!
Send love
Andrew ffs… don’t do me dirty like that I’m in public!   Seriously tho this is my new shower cry song ❤
This is so beautiful♡
The half up hair do is doing something to me 🫡
I'm not crying you're crying.
Thank you for this, Hozier! Beyond excited for the album to drop 🙌🏾💯
This is so different for him. I’m officially a fan.
i love how he styles his hair now he looks great
everyone say thank you to our sapphic protector
The part with the dino plushie sitting by the guitar amp was so cute and unexpecting.
Something about the way he sings " put me back in it", so forceful , makes this song so powerful
MAIN SLAYER

"How many times have you watched this?" Yes.
Какая красивая песня! Обязательно сделаю фортепианный кавер!
❤

Que bonita la estética del video y el sentimiento que me llega al escuchar esta pieza. Que bonito el cariño que le pones a todas tus canciones y que bonito el mensaje que transmites como artista. Gracias por compartir tu arte con nosotros ❤️🥺
Lovely bang of The Cranberries off this song
me hiiting the like bottom knowing that it'll be a masterpiece
I didn't think I'd have a favourite lyric other than "no grave can hold my body down, I'd crawl home to her." But "heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I" has altered my brain chemistry. Listening to this song isn't enough. I want it injected in my veins
Whoever said this was rubbish, I just wanna talk 😂
Simplesmente incrível. Sem mais.
the entire band is so devastatingly beautiful
the dinosaur😭😭
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Amazing
This is beautiful! It captures the vibe of the lyrics and the music perfectly. 🧡
More and more of him every passing MV. He is being seen even more this album. The days have come. 🥺
It was painfully beautiful
Suddenly everyone’s name is Francesca. thankyou so kindly for this beautiful masterpiece 🤍
this is the closest we'll get of being in heaven
Pls I literally forced my gf to watch it with me

Longest minute of my LIFE
🤩🤩🤩🤩
I'm freaking out
What the heck my comment immediately vanished into the void lol idk what happened. Anyway. Music soon 👀👀👀
❤
My name is Francesca! ❤️
Вам всем ещё не приходилось переживать таких сокровенных чувств что переживает один маленький человек с далекой Камчатки снующий от одного края дороги к другому  Шатающийся он погружается в обволакивающее инструментальное звучание каждой без исключения композиции и в исступленной восторженности падает ниц на снег и плачет от тех ассоциаций что вызывает у него эта выспренняя музыка
💯💫❤💫💯
🖤🥺👀
i'm SO ecstatic for this music video. this album so far (and it's not even fully out yet!) has been incredibly helpful for my peace of mind at this point in my life. i recently became disabled and nearly bedridden, and this song has REALLY helped me to not feel like a burden to my fiance
attentive to hear the new success of HOZIER!! ♥
Let’s talk about Francesca!   Francesca da Rimini or Francesca da Polenta was a medieval noblewoman of Ravenna.   She fell in love with Paolo, the younger brother of her old and deformed husband Giovanni, who she had married as part of a political strategy only.  Enraged at their betrayal, Giovanni slew both Paolo and Francesca where they laid.  In Inferno, Dante and Virgil meet Francesca and her lover Paolo in the second circle of hell, reserved for the lustful.  Very Hozier of them 🥺  I am absolutely in love with it! What do you all think about it? 🤎
waiting for this video to be my new personality trait
these are the longest 93 minutes of my life. plz Andrew let me see the video
I know I'm going insane in 97 minutes
thank you for sustaining me x
Hozier dropping Francesca MV right on time for Pride is his gift to us all thank u king
I’m so ready for this ❤️‍🔥
I’m already in love with the song which I hum all the time. This will just be the icing on the cake. ❤
❤❤
I’m so excited hope you guys all have an amazing day wherever you are and you all know you are loved and appreciated even when you don’t feel like it or feel like you don’t deserve it. Y’all are beautiful wonderful people ❤
I have an exam at the premiere time of the video but right after that, first thing after that, here for sure. Pretty sure it is gonna be wonderful.
AAAAAAAAAHHAHAHAA IM SO EXCITED
Every Hozier album has been released during a different era of my life and I can already feel that Unreal, Unearth is going to be just as crucial to my life as Wasteland, Baby! and the Self Titled album were.  “Do you think I’d give up, that this might have shook the love from me” #bpd  “But it was too soon when that part of you was ripped away” #trauma
I am so excited to see this one! All Things End video gave me so many emotions and helped with my personal life a lot! Love everything this man has came up with!
can't wait!
Let's go lesbians!! Lets go!! Got a horde of lesbians coming through!!! 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
I think this might actually be the best song I’ve ever heard & I’ll actually die when I watch this. Hozier I’m in love with u
ID TELL THEM PUT ME BACK IN AHHH AHHHHHHH I WOULD DO IT AGAIN!!!! AHHH AHHHHH
AAAAHHHHH ARE YA'LL READY?!!?!?!?!  IM GONNA BARF
If this man doesn’t stop I’m gonna fall in love-
stoked to blast this in my car driving down 280 😌
So excited! Love this song so much!!
The video isn't out yet  But I know we will all cherish it and all the effect that got put into the music video  Like all the editors and the people who actually shot everything, the dancers I assume and the people who picked the outfits, or made the settings  We are all very thankful to have you around and help hozier with his music ❤❤❤ -all of his fans  (I havnt seen the trailor I want to be very surprised so idk if there's dancers and who actually help but i assume so )
5th comment 😂😂😂
