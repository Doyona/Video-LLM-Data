I'm just here to compare the trailer from S14. S14 seems more interesting.
*Prance, Symone! Prance!* 👸🏾
Out with the trash, give papa Legba my regards.
This season has been so good 🥺
Season 13 is kinda boring....sorry....
not the straights in the comment. 😳
What all of these frightened straight people recommended this video don't understand is that by commenting on it they are sending one of the biggest messages to YouTube to show more similar content to them hahahahahahaha enjoy
Jesus is coming soon and this is what y’all want to talk about? Tuff...
So I have a feeling Elliot with 2 t’s goes home first cuz no images of her showing off other looks come up on the trailers!
You couldnt pay me enough to 👀⏺🔱🚮🚮🚮☣☣☣☣
They need to take the show off the air that is not good for people to see that orchids that is not right😲😲😲😲😤👎👎👎
Crupted sisity
what kinda YouTube realm did i just walk into   puff puff pass
Wait, where am I?
uhy
Omg yay
Offing myself
What is wrong with society
Oh nah
Ewwwww tf is doing on my feed.
Literally supper stupid.
You know, Drag has always been very foreign to me, but I might actually watch this year just to see what any of it...is. It seems fascinating, at least.
I knew this comments section would be...interesting.
Imagine actually watching all of these he/she’s for fun Hahahah this show is disgusting
What are these things.
Gross
I’m still trying to find the girls
Unless your gonna transform into some super cars I don’t wanna see it
In my book drag racing is slicks and e85
Omg these are guys how do you like this
YouTube, stop.
This is disgusting. At least age restrict this ad
These people should be thrown in jail
The rest twist is when they dip pop out
Every day we move further away from God
Something is wrong with you people
Where are the cars
🙄🙄🙄🙄
A shame how twisted the world has become
You people make me sick!
Bbnm
🤢
So it cool to show our young boys that it cool to dresses up as a female this is not cool it okay to be gay but damn give our kids a chance
You’re not long for this world
🤢🤮
⁰⁰0⁰⁰
⁰⁰0⁰⁰
⁰
Go home and raise ya kids
Gross
I'm sick of seeing this advertisement.
And people wonder why America is in the shape it is in this is disgusting and YouTube should not throw it my face to make it relative
This is disturbing...
Why do y'all glorify this bs
The best thing you could do is throw this stupid garbage in the trash no one wants to watch it
The real twist is they need to take this tf off tv
Nasty 🤮
so this is first world
Oof. Looks like youtube algorithm is having a stroke. This Litteraly has nothing even remotely close to the content I look up 😂
I love shows about 60 year old men in mid life crises.
This is the grossest thing I have ever seen
Delete this nonsense
That’s a dude
Lame
Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you! 😁
Lol how do people pretend this is entertaining
Yeah, I’ll take a firm pass.
Oh my gosh... this looks awful 😭
Jesus is KING
YouTube I just don’t care tbh
Who's the alien in the thumbnail?
I'm sorry. But youtube stop giving me this ad. I don't, and will never watch this show.
That’s weird
Disgraceful sad and tasteless. And  low rent
I tried to block this but it keeps coming back, help
get off of my recommend thanks
These girls look like they’re related to the girl who randomly pulls out the paper in hunger games
So no guest judges this season?👀😷
Despite it being weird i mean are they hurting anyone, the only bad thing is influencing children to do this but whatever
Disgusting
Eww
I love how all the ppl who hate this are all 10+ year old boys and or grown men who live in the south.  Hmm.. men never change..
What the flying hell did I just see and how did I get here.
I’m just here for the comments.
Why do I keep on seeing so much cyberpunk 2077 characters in ads
Not the drag race I was expecting
Nobody:  Kahmora: *WhErE*
Wtf is happening
REPENT SINNERS
Michelle Obama has a tv show?
awesome can't wait so excited!!
I wanna die
No dude... No.
The difference between newest and top comments are astronomical
👍
Is this the one that Michael Obama makes a guest appearance?!
Bruh honestly idk why youtube recommend me these ads
I have never watched anything related to this yet I am getting an ad for it. The fact that YouTube is constantly trying to force me to watch this kind of content is making me even less likely to watch it. YouTube, please explain.
Why did i get this ad
Why is YouTube pushing this cringeworthy bullshit into my recommendations?
wait where are the cars i just got scammed
LMAO THEY STARTED DELETING COMMENTS AND DISLIKES
Evil
As a Bi guy I don't get the appeal of drag queens.  I like crossdressing guys yeah, but they still look like guys and don't try as hard to look like a woman as drag queens do. I just seriously think drag queens go too far with all the makeup and implants.  I just don't get it
Gross
It’s D.N.A. proves that it’s a man.
Im vomiting
I highly doubt 20k people liked this
This is fucked
What’s this trash?
alice in wonderland characters
People who pretend this is normal, are lost.
Eww
🔥Demons🔥
Every1 in comments have deep issues
Oh look plastic people. They look so real
This is sooooooooooooo annoying!!! I’ve seen the commercial 50,000 times on TV and it just keeps on coming. Nobody cares!
I came to see a drag race, left disappointed :(
I love their hair style but the hair is not really my inspiration.
Oh God,,,its the bowel movement show🤮
yucky
the natural guttural reaction to such filth transcends deleted comments or falsified like ratios
gross
No more Old Navy commercials😫
this is a disgrace
disgusting
Stop ✋🏻 please 🛑
sombofys getting there salad tossed tonight
why tf is this being recommended
I like how they deleted my dislike and every else’s dislike
This is not the type of race I was expecting, where's the crazy cars going top speed?
First we overlook evil. Then we permit evil. Then we legalize evil. Then we promote evil. Then we celebrate evil. Then we persecute those who still call it evil.
Eww... 🤢
This is so disappointing
Putrid
Taboo
Grotesque
Filth
Disgusting
What's bothersome is the haters, you don't see anyone here spouting hate and fear except the ones who are not a part of the fun and acceptance and love of Drag. Everybody say LOVE!!!
Gross
when s12 ended, i said s13 has big shoes to fill... GIRL IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID FILL IT UP HUH AHHHH
More like make us throw up sick
I don't want to see this!
I think a lot of these comments are really negative. I don’t like drag that much but I don’t think it’s gross or un-family friendly, either. Nor is it morally wrong. What I have a problem with is YouTube deleting top comments and removing dislikes. That’s scary
Thanks, YouTube, I hate it
Terrible
No thanks.
Why is YouTube recording this to everyone ? Not everyone is gay
How about No
Can’t change your biology. Scientific fact
Why is this a ad
My girls? You mean guys
I am upset
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤬🤮
I love RuPauls Drag Race, Can’t wait to watch!
We still forgetting ru paul is transphobic
Ew what
Every day we stray further from god
YouTube is adding likes and deleting dislikes, yesterday this had at least 10,000 dislikes and 2,000 likes
Hard to even make fun of this
Que rallos
Diablos
Deuteronomy 22:5.  “A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God."
I hate her
YouTube so desperate I swear lol
Is that Michelle Obama??? 😂
Thisnis horrendous ahhhh
Dont show me this ad how do  stop this
Why am I here? I could be doing something productive with my life but instead I'm watching a trailer for the newest season of the weirdest show ever.
*s i n*
Yuuuuuuuck
This isn't joskue vs yoshikage.
Is there gonna be any guest judges?
Wait this isn’t that drag race I thought it was 😳
🤮
What the hell is wrong with you people?
Blah🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The person suffering with cancer drowning themselves in makeup is, concerning to say the least
they are all males
Reported for repulsive content.
The real twist is that I thought this was about cars. Very misleading
Bleh
Goodness can't even watch youtube without seeing a deranged adult anymore
People actually watch this?
I have a sad backstory, I should win, thank you, lol.
Should be on some adult only channel 🤮
This is so gay
Aw hell naw
What tf is wrong with this World?!
Why has no one shot this up yet.
I dont fucking care
I bet when Rupaul goes to take a dump it just falls out.....
Keep deleting my comments YouTube. I'll keep putting them up there.
How is this even remotely fulfilling in their lives? This show is more depressing than anything
Its all so tiresome...
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I’m not homophobic, they’re afraid of me and should be
Gross, why do people watch this guy?
I know I just saw Obama
Ew
🤮
que merda em!..
As long as I stop seeing that atrocious Old Navy commercial that shits so annoying
What
Ok
Fingers crossed covid hits the majority of the cast and crew. It'd be doing the world a favor, anyways.
Ew
I never watched rupal but I know I am loving it already becuse I watched a few episodes and like James Charles tv series thing the rupal ep
Disgusting

He neeeeeds to have Toddrick Hall guest star here
This is low key kinda gay.

My mind is deteriorating and I don't know how much longer I can take any of this
Nobody wants to see this
How is this entertainment

Wtf did I just watch
🤢🤮
Why in the world was I recommended this
Ew
Ew
Ugh gross YouTube... Why'd you show me that?
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The real twist is that they are grown men
Is Big Mike Obama going to be in this season?
Please be our nations 1st female president
My one fear is drag queens
Why does this exist?
EWWWWWWWWW
Why do drags exist? A bunch of grown men putting on tons of face paint to look like women like what?
This reminds me of the Capitol people in the hunger games. So detached from reality.
Lmao don't care
I'm not gay bi or anything I'm straight drags are interesting and they entertain me
Absolutelty vile and Disgusting content 🤢🤮
Quit shoving this stupid show down my throat, I couldn’t care less
This is a disgrace
Sadness
Why tf is this is my recommendations
Why is it back
I didn't know monsters inc was a tv show
I don't know it seems kinda sus
You will have your place in hell for all the souls you helped lead astray, your part will be extra hot.
Barf
Yuck dudes in dresses what kind of show is this
Okay Symone out of drag kinda looks like that lady that said “WHAAAT CHOCOLATE” 😂😂😂 or a grimlin 🤷🏽‍♂️ IM JUST SAYIN
Look over there!!  Where?!
The gag is Michelle in green. IN GREEN!!!! AND LOOKING INCREDIBLE!
i cant reach that website this link leads me to the facebook site ?! help
it'd definitely have something to do w money i bet! like they win money and a prize if they win the lip synch
Ummm did I miss the twist?
im even more excited omg
omg what
Will this be on Netflix international?
a "twist" instead of policy and moral changes lol... how about a "twist" where a openly trans queen comes on or maybe a "twist" where queens aren't edited to be evil so everyone can be appreciated? that would be epic ru!!
The real twist is this season being moved to the CW aka the beginning of the end 😢😢😢
Can’t wait to see denaly and Joey jay on all stars😍😍😍😍😍
Michelle Visage wearing greeeennnn what what in the what?
Some of these hairlines.... Could be better
THIS SEASON IS SLAYAGE
this promo look sofa king good.
has michelle made a black face?
0:37 AH! What’s Happening?!😃
The Grand Finale will be a zoom video, again?
Taylor Swift: releases Evermore RuPaul: hold my drink
girl but wait michelle is in greennnn
I'm so excited omg this looks epic
All of these queens look the same.  It looks like they all share the same closet..  WHERE are the new trends?!?  We need some diversity, everyone is trying to look the same now.. 🤦‍♀️
Dude Michelle looks stunting
I'm ready :)
Had to play it again honey
I can’t wait!!!!!!!
It will probably be like season 12 no one eliminated episode 1 but winner doesn't Lipsync
So excited!!!!!!! Bring back my girls ✨
is new year’s day like ... january 1? or like december 31
am i the only who thought that was rock m's voice at 0:17
I'm so ready for this
Will it be on Netflix like all the previous seasons?
This season looks incredible. I just hope the finale isn't like season 12's. IDC if it's lipsync battles in a small stage, just please not through a zoom call.
Is this gonna be on cogeco channel 181?
Team Symone all the way
Ru thought we wouldn’t find out about the fracking... just like he thought this twist was anything close to a shock 😄
not [spoiler] saying "where" and being the first out
Honey every body has an opinion, mine=FABULOUS!!!!💗💗💗💖💖💖💖💖❣️❣️❣️💜💜💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can we get a version of All-Stars that's 100% lipsynching for their lives? Si-Vous-Plaît xo If Todrick could host that would be perfect. :)
Where can I watch? Philippines ♥️
Urgh so weird to see a mole on Ru's face, it just doesn't seem right! He never does it, it looks so wrong now...
AGGHHHHH
considering that they filmed Season 13 during the pandemic, they might as well film the crowned queen on stage like they used to in earlier seasons. cause i think we can all agree that we don't want to see a queen being crowned via Zoom lol.
Yes💛😘 I can't wait❤️💛
Wow, finally my life have some sense :D
Bruh is Rupaul joining in?
The real twist is michelle visage looking stunning in green.
January is now draguary
Oooh my body is ready!!!
I love Gottmik's makeup! I'm so excited for the new season!
Symone is going to snatch my wig and stomp on it 😭 I can't wait
Living for Kahmora already
No.
🎭https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
Well at 60 Rupaul’s jaw will soon be dropping,off!!! ❤️🏳️‍🌈
More of the same, AGAIN. I'm done with this show.
Fans: ***RETURNING QUEENS***      Rupaul: No
I wish they would go for different looks. All of them look like past queens. I will still watch tho lol.
I am SO excited! I'm team Olivia! I'm so ready for the drama and tea this season, the girls look amazing.
Another reason that 2021 can't get here fast enough! 👑🎉🥂
Wait, did you edit better the lipsynch performances? I really do hope for that!
Another stupid change ?
Can we talk about how Michelle looks incredible😳💕
RUPAUL IS EVERY SEASON MORE.FLAWLESSSSSAJAUSUUA, QIIEIEIEIWEIAJA
Who else got the feels when I’m a winner started playing 😭 I love that song it’s so perfect it always makes me think of Jaida❤️
We like big surprises..
6 Lip Syncs For Your Life in the Season 13 premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race I'm gagged!
extremely weird
🤢
Not gonna lie - Michelle needs to go. She’s biased and gives bad advice sometimes (Max stop wearing gray wigs). - they need to put original season 1-8 queens as judges too. They are veterans now
😎😎
0:28 YAS Azealia Banks is gonna be judging 😍
Watch them do a "Ru-demtion Haus" or something with the queens who get out early
🤮🤮🤮
Omg yesss I’ve been waiting for this 😆😆😆😆
When do we get a season pass of drag kings?
WE WANT BRITNEY SPEARS AS A GUEST JUDGE AFTER SHE IS FREE AGAIN 🌿🧡
The real twist is they did this while we were in quarantine
Who else loves RuPaul's sense of humor and wit?
Jaw-Droping twist: Michelle has silver hair. Oh wait... We saw it in How's Your Head, Hun?
All of you better REPENT ,JESUS is coming to RENDER & REWARD EVERY MAN according to their works!
Michelle's hair and green outfit are the real jaw-dropping season 13 twist
JAMES 6/25/87
Can't wait
Jesus is real and when He returns it will be to judge. Turn away from wickedness and trust Him as your savior.   If Jesus is real (He is), wouldn't you want to know? Dig in and do your research, pray to God, and all your questions will be answered!
This world is doomed lol.
is it jawdropping?
Hey random person scrolling down the comments.     Have a wonderful day  :)
did i really just saw gottmik going home mirror moment?
😉😊😀😃😄😁😆
Now i am convinced that Katy Perry is a special judge/guest in RPDR 13 0:50
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos♥️
OH Y'ALL WANTED A TWIST EY?
Lol sad
tamisha looks so good
00:14
Love you Ru ❤❤❤❤
What nonsense
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Michelle is OWNING that silver streak. Yesss girl. Age with grace 👏🏻👏🏻
YASSSSSSS OMFGGGGGG YESSSS IM SO EXCITED ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
How much you want to bet the iTune sales for Rupaul's songs spiked after the last multi-lip-sync battle? Making this "surprise" the most predictable thing to ever happen.
One thing i've noticed is the guest judge, no teaser at all unlike the past seasons i googled and found out that the show did it intentionally to hide her until the premiere airs. i mean as a swiftie theres no way for Taylor Swift to not be invited as a judge for this season. 1st of all it's season "13"(her lucky number), the theme of the promo is "pastel" (same theme with YNTCD mv) and rupaul made a cameo in it so theres must be a message behind that also she tweeted last night using a gif of rupaul and RPDR acc. replied. Taylor swift loves being secretive sometimes so my theory makes a lot of sense. 💚
The real yoga, which is called raja yoga is to lead a highly moral life not morality according to circumstances but through ethical activity in life, clear thinking. They never mentioned exercise but their emphasis was a very moral life, highly mind which is active. The meaning of the word yoga is to join the higher with the lower.
Does anyone know if we are getting guest judges this season? Also every 3 seasons we see a new untucked lounge so I hope a new one is ready for us
michelle in greens OMG
So a bunch of dudes in cosplay?
0:05 *kennedy davenport voice* what's wrong with rupaul teets
Whaaaat Im gagging
Para iniciar un año super drag amooooo
Yasssss 😍❤️
Every person on this show looks the same now smh. Boring!
That queen doing the jazz split looks like joey jay cause it's very similar to his entrance look
Ya'll I'm actually so excited lol
Gaaayyyyy!!!
Rupaul never learn... NO MORE TWISTS!!
Queens: Serving amazing looks, splits, makeup, energy, talent Fans: oMG MiChellE iS WeArInG GrEeN!!!
Miss Fame and Charlie Hides would have gone home on the first episode XD
ewwwwwwwwww
the real gag is michelle visage wearing green
kandy muse looks AMAZING
Wait I just realized no guest judges :( I feel so bad for these girls
I'm really excited for this new season but I also feel like Season 12 has just happened and it's not that long ago. Let Miss Hall be our queen for a little longer lol
I remember watching rupaul season one when it was on satelite tv.... like i fell in live then lmao teenage girl wishing she was a boy to be a girl again?! Lmao 😂 was confusing adolescent years
CANNOT FUCKING WAIT!!! 😍
Let's hope this season will be just as jaw dropping like s12 was but so far im loving this line up of girls
TAYLOR SWIFT FOR PREMIERE JUDGE 13 IS HER FAVOURITE NUMBER PLEASSEEEE 😭😭😭 And this absolutely looks like her lover aesthetic so You need to calm down lipsync!!
I am so excited for utica queen
I think the 6 kweens walkin into the werk room are the 6 winners of ep 2... One in red idk could be Tina burner, then kandy, symone, lalari, olivia lux, and gottmik
0:54 - This is why I stan RuPaul. Period.
I can tell this won’t be my favourite season. Not the queens I expected for season 13
I think this season is going to be really good🙈
no more mass lip synchs
I CANT WAIT!!!
#TeamSonique 💜💗💟💗💜 #TeamGottMik   👑💖#OrgulloTrans 👑💖
Elimination Order: Epidose 4: Kahmora Epidose 5: Joey  Epidose 6: Tamisha Episode 7: Elliott Epidose 8: Lala Epidose 9: Delani Epidose 10: Double Shantay  Epidose 11: Tina Burner Epidose 12: Utica Epidose 13: Olivia   Top 4: Rosé, Symone, Kandy Muse, Mik.
Stan the new lights on the stage
Michelle: take a look around you honey, there's a competition. Kahmora: where Me: aaaaaaaaaaaaaagh 😂😂😱🤯
Michelle: Take a look around honey, you got some competition. Kahmora: where? I'm dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The biggest twist this season would be people not sending death threats to queens
The video ended and I'm still waiting for the jaw-dropping twist...
Is Drag Race Season 13 going to be available at Netflix ?
Rupaul acting as a matriarch to the queens... Is anyone going to keep ignoring the fact that Rupaul doesn't even care for the queens?
i'm loving these graphics and color pallet
Obvio lo veré
Ok but what is the twist? I'm confused
wait how-    6 lipsyncs -   half the girls get eliminated?
Top 4 -  Symone  Gottmik  Utica  Kandy  im excited for Kahmora, Lala, and Iman
Oh good, i thought they were doing double winners again
0:45 BAG BALL?!
So this season will not rely on super big special guest judge on their premiere. It’s interesting!
If you’re not stanning Tamisha, you’re wrong
Morgan McMichaels once said: Competition? What competition? 🤭😭
Why is no one talking about the fact that there will be 6 lipsyncs BUT THERE ARE 13 QUEENS?  C'mon math, let's get bugging
Gag!!😜😲
What’s the twist?
The judges having the protector between them but the queens just get nothing???
The real twist is the fracking we made along the way
Kandy is a mood 😎
Does this season Nina is gonna be black chyna ? That's the true twist
“I hope u like surprises, you’ve all been given the COVID-19  vaccine, first one who dies winS.”
Can't waitttttt
Omg! Yes hunty!
It looks to plasti RuPaul's makeup.
That's the worst makeup I ever seen on RuPaul 4 demo.
So far the girls are not that attractive
I think will be seeing more drama this season and I need it.LOL:D
Am I the only one that notice that there’s probably no guest judges this season??
0:15 "That one, we gotta watch out for that one"
0:50 😂😂
well it doesn't look like what I thought it would! Nice!
This show no longer promotes the art of drag.  This show now promotes art of making as much money as possible.
Mammi Ru!!!!! The  BEEEEEEEEST way to start 2021!!!!! I adooooore you!!!!💖💖💖💖💖💖
She look like TATIANNA
I wonder what the runway song is gonna be this season. I'm so excitedddd idk what I'm gonna do until Jan 1st besides have this trailer on repeat!!!
I DONT UNDERSTAND THE TWIST CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME PLEASE
Jaida Essence Hall: "Look over there!" Kahmora Hall: "Where?"
Y’all. You realize the twist is that Michelle is wearing green, right?
Michelle : this is competition honey! Kahmora Hall : Where???  *Kahmora Hall is the first one to go home* Kahmora : 👁👄👁️
BAKLAAN NAAAA JUSKOOO #TeamKandyMuse
Why is no one noticing all the changes to the mainstage :<. The new horizontal led strips in the back, the new lights in the white tiles and the led pipes which are lining the edge of the mainstage instead of lightbulbs, so many changes!!
YYYYAAAAAAA!!!!!!
*lmao*
I'm so excited beyond words.
another double premiere??? 😍
can we just talk about how STUNNING kahmora is- like miss girl. 0:39 JNBJFNKVN STUNNING! 0:21 amazing!!!!!
Ok but can we talk about how good Michelle looks like...come on babes
All this twist and the winner will not be the consistent one but the one with a storyline or background story. Yeah, it’s inspiring but tired of majority of winners winning on the account of sob story, gimmick instead of consistency and excellence. So for drag race girls, don’t aim for excellence. After your second win, you will be headed to the “boring” storyline. Just sail by then have a gimmick towards the end. Or a really sad story. Rant Over! Haha
I Think This Is A Movie Tralier😂😂
For your life!?! Are they going to be eliminating 6 queens on the first episode!?!
I don't see a star amongst the cast
RuPaul loves a Pun and a Twist.
God I am so excited
"Come on Season 13! Let's get sickening!"
Yesss they’re bringing back the runway challenge
"I hope you like surprises"  Oh, the fracking?   JK All jokes aside, finally they did the runway lights justice!
Where is the twist mama?
new logo of rupaul's drag race... condragulations: you're the winner of this week's makeover challenge
Michelle looks like Meryl Streep here
Kahmora: Where? Jaida: Look over there! 👈👀
Now we get to see early how each girl lip syncs. This will be good!
0:06 why does Ru with that shoulder pose remind me so much of RaPal Dark Res??? Come on meme!!!
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW GREEN IS LITERALLY MICHELLE’S COLOR???
Kahmora be looking like Lucy Liu and I am livinnggggg
Y’all wanted a twist eh?!
YESSSSS❤️❤️
is no one gonna talk about how good the stage looks like it's so much better now!
Wait, so there's a 6 Lipsync and there's 13 queens. So there's one queen who didn't Lipsync, or there's a lipsync with 3 queens?
Who’s the guest judges?
I LOVE LOOOOOVE THE NEW COLOR PALLETTE!!!
Let's do it!!!!!!!!!!!
they really like their lights this season
poor jaida not even getting a year to reign let alone a decent tour
I CAN'T WAIT!!!
CANT WAIT!!!
I mean we could possibly get a queens full lip sync potential in this episode then they when they get eliminated
Miss Rona is my new drag persona. She loses to about 99 percent of other queens but totally slays the game against the rest.
yo those LOOKS THO, from literally everybody, from contestants to judges, they really stepped their game upppppp
I find it confusing why they would give this away?
“where”
kahmora reminds me alot of Yuhua Hamasaki
Does that mean 6 girls are going home on the first episode?
I can't wait to see... All the trade 🤭
im going to like like this season. already fun
WHEREE?!
the twist is michelle is wearing green
This new season of Steven Universe looks bit different
Yaaass!!!
I wonder if there will be any guest judges this season since it was filmed during quarantine
Michelle got that Miranda Priestly vibes with this look
Michelle Visage in GREEN?!?! honeeeeyyy what a twist
The new twist is the glasses in the panel judges
Game changing but I'm more ready for snatch game, reading challenge, sickening runway looks, shades, drama and etc. Come on season thirteen. 1⃣ 3⃣
oh wow these looks  they dont amaze me yet
I wanna scream
Only on vh1? But Netflix too yeah?
The twist is that they all have to LYSFYL
Oh no, Simone does light-skin black face.
Britney Spears AND Willam as guest judges! Together.  You know.....same show.  I’d pay to see that mmmhmmmm
imagine bianca competing in these new seasons 😂 they are avoiding more and more queens like her on the show
MORE OF THE SAME JUST BORING
You wanted a twist, eh?! Come on season 13 let’s get sick-ningggg
who do you think will be the villain of the season?? my vote goes to tina burner (idk why i just get some vibes from her) or eliott with 2 ts
Ummm RuPaul looks good af at the end laughing
The lip syncs are always the least favourite bit of the show for me :-(
Okay, but where is the celebrity guest judge??
This season might be one of the best
“Where?!” 👀...
I can't wait!! Absolutely LOVE Momma Ru!! And the queens are hilarious!!  ❤️❤️👑👑
Whats with the new season of steven universe?   Jkjk new season looks 👌
That girlie is recently over cancer and she goes into a show in a middle of a pandemic?? that was bravery
1st lipsync song = rythym of the night by CORONA
Kandy is going to be a whole mood and I am here for it
“Where?”  Also: goes home first
i thought my laptop screen had a dirt when i first saw mama ru's mole 😂
me when they announed the new twist even though i already read spoilers about it: 😱😱
All I see it’s a Bulldog
the wigs
Gottmik is ✨SERVINGGG✨
Yes I’m ready for the new memes lol
I didn’t see much of denali :( hope she didn’t go home first ✨😭
This is a GAG
the real twist was the MICHELLE WAS WEARING GREEN
Oh my god Kahmora just- "where?' Yes
OK BUT HEAR ME OUT!!  6 lipsync for your lives on EP ONE, WOULD THAT MEAN THERE IS 5 OTHER COMPETITORS THAT WE DONT KNOW ABOUT YET?!?!
Michelle looks so beautiful
1:02c.
Kahmora: "Where?" Also Kahmora: -gets eliminated first-
After season 12’s guest judges, I’m so curious who they got on this season
Are y’all gonna ignore that Tamisha said she was recovering from cancer
I can't wait Sooooooooo love thee escapism
Michelle with the silver streak on her hair, im obsessed, im happy she didnt cover it up for the show she looks stunning
The Twist is that Michelle is going to be dressed in green 👗🟢🟩
The stage lighting looks fabulous ✨
WHAAAAT?!? A LSFYL?!?!??!? I definitely didn’t see that coming!!!! 😱😱😱😱
Did i just really saw mik about to draw her mirror message
This is going to be SO GOOD! I just can't wait.  Rooting for Joey Jay, Symone, Gottmik, Utica, Kandy, Denali... but actually I liked ALL the girls. Such a strong cast.
That mole on Ru’s face is a plot twist I never saw coming
Literally all of these queens are sooo stunning and likeable from what I can tell - I hope my opinion doesn’t change after watching 👏 but of course we love a little bit of petty drama here and there
It’s obvious Raven does Rupaul’s makeup. She looks like Rupaul in Raven face. Sorry, but true. Cannot unsee.
THANK YOU,  WE THE WORLD  NEED YOU  YOUR SHOW, IT GIVES  US SOMETHING  TO LOOK FORWARD  TOO! MUCH LOVE FROM CHICAGO!❤😍👀👏
im rooting for the clown of the season periodt.
Does this mean that there won't be any guest judges? :(
I'll pause every second so I can see all these incredible looks....✨💕
Waiting patiently 😁🤸‍♀️
Legit thought Rajah Ohara had cancer
I really the design style they chose for the theme.
New twist is that it’s gonna be the same old fuckery
I like how RuPaul uses Drag Race for political awareness - just look at recent winners - so I hope she will finally have an Asian winner.
Will it be available on Netflix or VH1 only?
Real Twist: A 14th Queen - *Miss Rona Corona* Oop!
Kandy say It " Vixen is Crazy?
starts 2021 with a bang huh.... ❤️🎉🔥
TWIST
Symone wins
ready for this.
OMFG DID I SEE MICHELLE VISAGE WEARING GREEN AT 0:50
wtf? WHY THIS SEEMS SO FREAKING DOPE?
I'M ALREADY LIVING FOR THE LOOKS 😍😍😍
CONDRAGULATIONS
00:18 looks like lipstick on the mirror moment
Okay but why is gotmik kissing the mirror in full drag? Is this her elimination?!?!?!
Is that Michelle wearing green?
Can i just say i’m soooooo excited ... Michelle visage looks gorgeous ... the werk room is red ... The queen are looking fierce ... and of course rupal is so beautiful I can’t wait
The gaggery of it all, dahlings!!
Yessss i am so excited let's SLAY girls. ❤💯👏
Can someone explain me. 13 queens six lip-synch‘s for the lives
RuPaul's drag race twist season
YAAAS QUEEN
I'm so excited!!! Michelle look amazing with that hair 😍
Am I the only one living for the fact that they finally put lights on the squares in the back of the stage?💡
odd number of queens huh. Who are the unlucky queens that have to be a part of the 3 queens lipsync or who is the one gets to be exempt cause of a mini challenge win?
I can't wait!
Wait...won't it be on Netflix this time...I will die if it's not available on Netflix...literally me and my 5 year old daughter live to watch this show and we live thanks to netflix hosting rupauls drag race...please oh god 🙏🙏🙏🙏
10:43 has the best 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Y'all...Symone's wig was made by Gigi Goode🤙
'out with the old in with the new' *still against cist female queens* *still transphobic*    (ps stop supporting this show hunnies, yall are better than this, you can grow as a person and become smarter) <3
I love rupauls drag race, I watch it all the time
So I wonder if the makeover challenge will just be them doing the eliminated queens again, since hey the eliminated queens would already have been in quarantine anyway.
Im just waiting for Spain Drag Race 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
0:52 the shadeeeee
Can we get the first 10 mind sneak peak already. Dayum
Me, after reading all the spoilers for the season: Oh my god what a surprise :O
Michelle gets more and more beautiful every single season. she’s got the antidote yall.
Ugh. Usually when shows change their format completely it sucks and makes the show worse. I hope this isn’t the case.
And yet again, I'm the trade of the season..  I'm tired chile 🤣
Just wait for the drag KINGS
When????
Miss Rona for congeniality.
The real twist is Michelle wearing green henny
Since this show was filmed during COVID, I hope they go back to the original Format when they crown the  Queen they way they do in all stars or earlier seasons.
They say everything's about to change every season
wowwwwwwww another lip sync twist crazyyyyyyyyyy would never have guessed
Everything you know is about to change?  Let's be honest, don't we hear that every season?
the most lackluster trailer. hope the season is better
Can we just acknowledge how STUNNING Michelle and Ru look as per usual!!!
The twist is no guest judges? 👀
The real twist is Michelle Visage wore green.
Change.....? I see no drag kings.... and honey. It’s about time 👑
Need lovely 😍💋 💝💖❤️
tamisha had cancer awww but look how far she's come now
I am so excited oml
I'm excited to watch the first FTM contestant. He is obviously beautiful and talented and I look forward to hearing his story as a female-to-male drag queen performer. Drag Race has come a long way in terms of inclusivity and I am living!!!
okay michelle looks FIERCE
lets take a moment to appreciate kandys confessional look
They always say there are gonna be surprises but is 99% The same 👍🏻
my god so many of these queens are such an inspiration to me
well they clearly have footage already which means that these were prerecorded so we don’t know when these were filmed 💗
the real twist was when they accidentally leaked this
0:15 mik is gonna slay us on the runway
Hope the intern kept the job 😂
so does it only have like 6 episodes?
How will there be 6 (1 v 1) lip syncs if there’s 13 queens?
Will this available  on Netflix  Note : im from India  Mumbai
Michelle: Around you is competition Kahmora: Where? I stand a talented and confident queen
can't wait
I miss Miss VANJIE ❤️🌼✨
Everything looks so fresh and new idk what it is....
Does anyone know the name of the backup song with condragutalion in the lyric ? Is it a old or a new rupaul's song ?
me knowing all the spoiled drag race Reddit tea: *fake shocked pikachu face*
OMMMMG
My French Finals can wait for a minute :)
18 Minutes in and 3 people already gave the vid a dislike..
How am I this early-
One of these days I feel like Zendeya is guest judging the show eventually. I can just feel it in my gut
This is the best birthday gift I could ask for
Goddamn Michelle look BEAUTIFUL
I'm just thinking whom will we get on premier episode as guest judge this season
Were ready for a New~ Season👑👸
where *goes home first*
its so pretty and colourful i love it❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
I love this
I need this right now..... thanks baby girl
"Take a look you've got some competition" "Where" 😱🙈😂😂 yaaasss
#TeamKandy #TeamTina #TeamSymone #TeamGottmik 💖
Love Michelle’s grey streak she’s giving me life after death
am i crying? yes , am i excited? YUPP I LOVE DRAG RACE AND THESE QUEENS
Are there no guest judges this season?
michelle in green w/ grey hair like
prepare to be gag hunni for season 13
OMG, the main stage.... Gag
I feel like since this was filmed during quarantine the twist should’ve been that the eliminated queens get to stay and interact with the other girls, tho they wouldn’t get a chance for the crown but at least we would get to know them better, more like Big Brother style
Utica better get enough confessionals coverage, because I need the kookiness. I need it. Go on, hate me, but I need it.
Mother loves a twist 💫
OMG!!! I can't wait!!!!!!! 😱
Lo esperaré 😍
I LOVE IT, the LaLaPaRUza was one of my all time faves 💟
No more  twist rupaul i just want drag queens
Anyone have any guesses as to whether or not the full cast will appear in the first episode, or if it will be split like s6 and s12? It might just be me, but some of the glimpses into the main stage with the Queens on it look like they were fairly spaced out, which leads me to believe that perhaps it's another split 2-episode premiere. But honestly that might just be my brain.
Omg season 13 I’m so excited for all the queens !!!! I hope this season doesn’t let me down !!!
Gagged!!! I can’t wait so must watching it, Yas, ready it!
Tamisha's drag reminds me of Jasmine Masters, seasoned!!!
Looks like they all quarantined beforehand, but no guest judges?
WE WANT BRITNEY SPEARS AS A GUEST JUDGE AFTER SHE IS FREE AGAIN 🌿🧡
New twist is Ru’s mole henny.
Micchelle Visage is stunning
MICHELLE LOOKS SO GOOD IN THIS~! happy for her
Ok y'all but can we talk about how GORGEOUS looks Michelle wearing green and with a new hair color? Gurl, she is stunning 💓💓💓💓💓💓
