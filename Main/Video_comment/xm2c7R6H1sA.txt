Bro just last night I had the weirdest elaborate dream about my little brother blowing up a bridge and playing volleyball in an airstrip.
27:21 CKY REFERENCE!!!!
look, i enjoy cold shower, not in the dead of winter of course im not a psycho. but when its 4983y84y328942394623784698234892348236784982347893274892374987389473892478923489237498237 degrees outside you bet your bottom dollar im taking a cold shower and soaking myself in ice water like a polar bear.
Such positive energy here.
10:49 most people with jobs and/or kids wouldn't have time to even watch this guy's video every morning, much less do all this shit.
Eatong worms in ur dreams means ur disgusted with yourself and having anxiety or guilt or shame.... so...
I wake up early not to get stuff done so I can play animal crossing for an hour before I leave
ts fucking FIRE
i do a lot of this shit already and i’m still poor af 😭
2:57 this god damn hand motion provokes an ancient wrath in my brain
2:55 Kurtis predicted 67 in 2022
Feels like female chadchad. Love it.
2:56 67
With 202 billion dollars, you could give every person In the world $25 and STILL have 2 billion dollars left. With the remaining money, you could pay the lifetime salaries of 330 engineers. Holy shit…
Dude, I've been watching your videos recently and love this. Something about this one had me cracking up more than the rest.
Hot take(?): I like cold showers sometimes it feels refreshing not like FREEZING but Luke warm to cool
he forgot anti-biotics
Recalling your dreams is useful for people who want to remember more of them and/or get into lucid dreaming stuff. It is a heavily recommended technique, actually.  But if you don't care about this stuff then yes, it is. Pretty pointless.
6:44 STOP BREATHING LIKE THIS
2:54 6 7 🤪🤪
sometimes i feel like i only like you bc you kinda look like what i think my brother would look like if he wasn't severely disabled
Normal people don't have time for this nonsense in the morning. I meditate before bed, exercise regularly, and do brain games whenever I can and feel like it. Statistically, not everyone can become a billionaire, and these checklists won’t help us achieve that. So, billionaires can just go ....
Kurtle turtle
Sorry I love your stuff but most of this includes what they tell you to do in therapy… so you’re mocking therapy practices while trying to mock billionaires.. says more about how the underclass can’t afford to practice simple mental health practices than it does mock billionaires.. like you aren’t making the point you want to- poor people can’t afford therapy practices and rich people don’t care, that’s the point you just made
i love worms  worm
you know... Kurtis' aggression talking about gross billionaires kind of turns me on...
We’re not human doings, we’re human beings 🙂‍↔️🙂‍↔️
I used to hate cold showers but now if my shower isnt cold I hate it
Off to an amazing start I don’t dream 😂😂😂🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Warren Buffett doesn't have teeth he has haunted gravestones in his mouth
He has the same hand writing as my best friend
I am at vacation and the shower is broken so I have to do a cold shower every time I shower
ngl the to be list is so based
no fucking way it was 3 years ago
12:35 i think that means you wanna assert your dominance cause youre a dog now actually
When scatman john said it, it was based. When that video says it, it is cringe
My father said you look like Dave Franco from Together (the 2025 film) 😭🙏
7:28 i like how the cold showers are what really got to him 😭 12:07
Your face during the alpha breathing is sending me 😂
dang ur alpha breath stinks
God this video holds up so well 😂
Does anyone know where to get the mug that he has 16:10?
I have POTS and heat really makes my symptoms inhanced, so the doctor recommended me cold showers. Even tho I will feel weird and dizzy all day I'd rather take a warm shower then a cold shower. Who reluctantly takes cold showers on purpose
dang ur alpha breath stinks
You know what brains technically need sugar to function so you could've sweetened that smoothie with a shit load of sugar to sweeten (your day haha, kill me pleas-) because if we know anything about billionaires, it's that they're bitter that no one believes that they give a shit about anything besides themselves (even though it's true but they still want people to believe that they do)
Couple of things are like an idea , like doing exercise and a bit of meditation helps but that's it  You can wake up at 4am and directly start your work after brushing + washroom , don't even need to meditate sometimes or exercise ( sometimes )
11:54 i was NOT ready for the face card jumspcare
i actually do take cold showers and get apples from panera sometimes...
it's also not good for your skin to make your bed immediately after waking up. you're essentially just trapping in all the dead skin, sweat and whatever else is on your sheets. i let them breathe while i take a shower and get dressed, making my bed is the last thing i do before leaving for the day
The only reason I would take a cold shower is on a really hot day
I have to go now. My planet needs me. 22:41 Note: Kurtis died on the way back to his home planet.
9:10 this is so real 😁❤️✨
I live in america and the summers where i am are HOT so I love cold showers in the summer lol.
I think recalling your dreams is actually really good for some people! If you get a good grasp of your dreams, you could lucid dream much more easily. Lucid dreaming always gives me a sense of control, and it's wonderful, so long as you know what you're doing. I always wake up in a good mood after I have one. Just be very careful about not triggering a lucid nightmare lol.
dang, ur alpha breath stinks
i like ur shark teeth
14:36
24:11 i got an ad here but i wasnt looking at my phone so i got really confused why kurtis randomly started singing in german💔
every time i watch this video i have to rewind to 11:44 several times because kiwi is so adorable
I wish I didn't have to take cold/cool showers but hot ones make me overheat so quickly idk how people do that😭
i wouldnt have a job if my morning routine to 2-3 hrs lmfao.  Sorry boss, late again cause of the usual routine of wasting as much time as possible, you know how it is.......im still getting paid right?
12:23 that usually means your fucking pissing yourself while your dreaming
9:10 WHY 26:21 i was laughing the whole entire time this was playing, infact not even laughing, i was DIEING, i havent been laughing like that in a WHILE
The ending was epic!
22:20 I was gonna say, I can’t believe Kurtis forgot why God sent a plague to punish the world. Cats 2019 is why we had to quarantine.
“Spinadge” 😔💔🥀
This video made me want a brain smoothie
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis your teeth look like Alex the lion’s teeth from Madagascar 6:16
I honestly thought he was just always winking 😂😂😂
I always take cold showers and i figured a way to not hate it, first of all you dont have to put your head first you gotta warm up by putting your limbs then your core and at last your head, but honestly if you dont have enough time you can water all your body and put soap on it, later you put shampoo on your head because it is bad to expose your body most important your head to cold water so while you soaping your body you get used to the coldness and there fore you soak your head.
When he shrugged at the beginning of the video, for a second he looked like white Lalo. Or maybe I’m just too infested with BCS 🥀
9:10 can someone please tell me what this screaming sound effect is from? It's driving me nuts
18:32 I love how Kurtis doesn’t even look grossed out. He’s just sad
Anyone forget that 3 years agow was Covid?
19:28 me playing sudoku while watching, "... At least he pronounced it right..."
Im late, but i liked this one, do more!!!
18:15 not enough liquid added.
25:50 nipple neck
As a college student, who overworks, I take cold showers when I’m so tired, I have brain fog. It shocks my brain awake. It’s also akin to…”harmless” self harm? Anyway, under normal circumstances, my water is like a nice warm blanket
Kurtis i think your hotel dream is telling you you have a piss k!nk!! 😁
26:44
God that alpha breathing fucking wrecked me ahahah
3 yeras too late, and probably besides the point, but: it sounds like your dreams center around anxiety, particularly around traveling. Two about trouble at the airport, and one in a hotel. I would guess you worry about making mistakes or embarrassing yourself while traveling, which is pretty normal. Maybe you would benefit from anxiety relief meditation, since it's on theme for the video anyway. So there, it's not useless to recall your dreams, it can help you spot a pattern
I need a channel that's only Kiwi
Dang, your alpha breath stinks
the fucking roast sesh at the beginning 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂 i have NEVER laughed that hard
Smoothies are actually just condensed sugar... you don't get any of the nutrients lol. It's basically a treat, the reason people lose weight with a smoothie diet is basically cause they aren't eating anything, just sugar liquid.
Bro do they assume we got to work at 11 & have 5 hours in the morning to do whatever we want
20:52 dream recall is a skill with lucid dreaming to raise your chances of becoming lucid.
aaa \
Chimpanzees are actually considered Apes, not Monkeys ❤
I remember why I never finished this video   “You can’t make money without exploiting the working class 🤓🤓” I didn’t come here for a communism lesson, thanks.
I like the channel but it seems kinda tone deaf to complain about billionaires while you yourself make millions for sitting in your room making youtube videos.
This hits so different in 2025
Kurtis Connor.
Breathing got me anxious asf
Am I the only one who’s shocked that Elon musk drinks magic mushroom tea EVERY MORNING????
16:02 this is my favorite thing that Kurtis does 😭 Like when he stumbles over his words and then just gives up lmao. He did it in the dig-tok video with Danny and Drew and sometimes I just watch that clip and laugh my ass off
"oow I'm a little cuck"  -Kurtis Connor 2022
lmao when the voiceover said "we're not human doings, we're human beings" i also immediately booed YUCK (edit: ALSO NOT THE AMOS DIGGORY CLIP)
Recall dreams: 😁 okay! make bed: 😁 okay! drink tall glass of water: 😁 okay! take your first breath: 😁 okay! meditate: 😁 okay! move body for 2 mins: 😠 no. take a cold shower: 😁 okay!
the alpha breathing segment damn near gave me a panic attack
Just a fyi Jeff bezos has ptosis. I have it to. I don't really care about the guy but that was kinda offensive. Ptosis is a condition where the upper eyelid droops over the eye. It can affect one or both eyes and vary in severity, sometimes obstructing vision. Ptosis can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired due to aging, nerve damage, muscle weakness  or trauma. But whatever I mean I'm commenting three years later😂
I've been talking cold showers since 11yo because when I get out of the shower the world feels inviting and a cold shower reminds me of discomfort which makes me grateful for living in a safe place with the one I love. NOT because I want a bunch of money🙄
not over Kurtis' hair in this one is sooo gorg like daamnnn wish i had hair like dat
hell yeah good intro i knew Kurtis has like class awareness and knows about the power structures and privelige in the world but its nice to hear him say it between all the jokes cus this whole project wouldve been a bit tasteless if he didnt specify that he is in fact NOT lickin them up the ass lol. ykwim??
as a fellow toronto dweller, having a fucking cold shower first thing in the morning in the winter here is genuinely evil how the HELL is that possible
I just finished working my overnights shifts, and apparently I have a UTI now (and my period woooo) on my goddam break … shits fucked. And dudeee thank u for such fucking banger videos, I’m crying cause of the pain but randomly laughing really hard. So yeah slay 👑
11:52 NOOOOO NOT THIS CLIP HAHAH
9:12 lol
That routine keeps you from becoming a billionaire if anything
Hang on, hang on. Is "brain training" billionaire for "work"? I  hate late stage capitalism
Hang on, hang on. Is "brain training" billionaire for "work"? I  hate late stage capitalism
Kurtis unintentionally hit a great point off the top. This livestyle is a single person game. Theres no way you can maintain a healthy relationship living like this
This is one of your funniest videos
I love you so much Kurtis but Jeff Bezos has a condition called Lazy Eye 1:55 and he can’t exactly control it and I have a friend with Lazy Eye and….. kinda pisses me off but your funny as hell
Playing the Thomas the Train theme at max volume while thinking about everything I ever did wrong is terrifying.
Noooooo it’s the sequel to 2021 (now it’s the 5th movie but wtv)
2:32 Bro forgot about notch
You don't need to a be a billionaire to have time in the morning. I had a habit for a while of watching movies before work, I started at 9am, took me half an hour to cycle there. If I was up by six I could finish most movies.
My mom told me to take a cold shower once because she read somewhere that it can help with OCD and anxiety. The cold shower was so distressing that I needed a Xanax and a nap afterwards. 0/10 don’t trust those studies
I just tried the alpha breathing thing and istg I almost suffocated 😭😭
Just me witnessing the Coup. Came here for comfort. Although maybe the ones with Billionaires isn't the best choice.
3 years ago but I stand for Kurtis. You can and SHOULD body shame a billionaire!
Crazy yap sesh
There's also no fucking way a billionaire doesn't have a personal chef making all their smoothies and breakfast and all that tedious shit that clearly makes it a 4 hour routine. Maybe brings it down to 2; still insane, but they're not doing this shit. They don't know avocados have pits in them
I don't see anyone mentioning how Lion's Mane is actually a type of shrooms, so dude starts the day microdosing on shrooms in his tea
Alpha breathing is just what my therapist taught me to do when I feel a panic attack coming on lol
Eating worms in your dream can mean feeling disgust, discomfort, or a need to confront unpleasant truths or situations in your waking life according to google lol maybe the doctor was saying you're feeling TOO disgusted 😂 or something idk. Dreams are weird
Kurtis… you just got done talking about how unhealthy you are… your dream symbolism is literally your doctor mad at you for living unhealthy…
Im on a Kurtis binge so that explains why im watching this in 2025. I love how one of the most replayed parts of the video is Kiwi doing a big morning stretch lmao
my laptop maybe be dieing but i will watch ur vids
Frozen blueberries and canned pineapple is my favorite smoothie combination ever. I will say its a 10/10 recommend.
When's the part when he starts working
oh my god this is crazy it feels like i watched this two days ago not three years ago wtf
i have to wash my hair in cold water because it's dyed and it actually is the worst
12:30 If that happened in my dream, it woulda also happened irl.
How much time do they have in the morning to waste on this stuff?
"and yes, I am body shaming him" 2:02 *shrug* lmao I LOVE it!
Noticed that a lot of your dreams are actually nightmares. I had that problem, and it was  my tonsils, had those suckers out, no more nightmares.
it takes me an hour and half to get ready in the morning and i just had a baby
chat i watched this while taking a shower am i the true alpha?
no dude, play cool math games
Statistically speaking the number of black billionaires makes perfect sense. They make up 13% of the population and make up 10% of the billionaires in america. Based on that statistic that sounds pretty even to me.
Who’s here in 2025? ✨💖✨✨
dang, your alpha breath stinks
My bed won't deteriorate in quality if I don't tidy it every day. Not the same as teeth!
Quick tip! If anyone wants to try cold showers, start off with a warm shower and slowly move it to cool or let the hot water run out if you’re one of the people who take long showers. You do not need to take freezing showers. When people say cold showers usually that means cool showers from what I’ve learned :,)
Coofffeee!! 😵‍💫❤
6 seconds in and Kurtis already made a dirty joke
3:09 their skin might be white but don't forget their ethnicity you cool liberal boy
This looked 6:47 like the ending credits of pearl
Cold showers or baths do actually rlly help reduce anxiety and panic attacks✨
(2:26) I THOUGH THE TEXT SAID "GOOD BOY" NOT "GOOD COACH" IM GONNA KMS MYSELF!!!!
I havent seen anyone on here mention that the unnecessary use of antibiotics is dangerous
6:44 holy shit, that is so scary
your house interior is fucking awesome
L
1:58 hell yah
kurtis hair looks so good in this video
14:06 I meditated once for like 10 minutes maybe for a class in highschool and all I did was feel bad about how I ended a friendship and then I decided to apologize to them… over YouTube’s comment section… on a video I posted at least 2 years ago… on a thread of comments that happened a few months before, of the ex-friend getting mad at me for calling him my ex-best friend…
The brain tea was the lions mane one right? Yeah you should consider trying that btw. Relaxing tea is definitely not a good replacement for that one 😂 ❤
someone needs to stop kurtis from all of these 'living like a week' lifestyle ideas
My morning routine consists of me rolling out of bed 5 minutes after my alarm went off and being thankful that my job doesn't require me to clock in at any specific time, so 7 minutes "late" is totally fine.
For a depressive person like me,  most of those things are really helpful.
I remember saying something to my friend about how much Elon Musk sucks, and after a short pause he just said "It's really amazing how he built his companies from the ground up without any help." Yeah, I guess, unless you consider having mega wealthy parents a form of "help."
4:54 Dang! Kurtis is spilling the juicy stuff!
I'm a newbie on your channel, this video specially make me laugh so hard xD Greetings from France ^^
dang ur alpha breath stinks
You're actually not allowed to bodyshame a billionaire as a little treat. Bodyshaming is still bad. Love the video, but that made me angry. Making fun of a bad guy for being bad is great, but making fun of a bad guy for their body is making fun of a body, not the guy. If you fatshame Trump, it shows all your fat friends that you truly do enjoy fatshaming and hold fatphobic beliefs and you just restrain yourself around them.
That dream of you pissing on the bed is clearly your comedy but dream form and I laughed
20 minutes of meditation might not actually be the worst habit ever if you have the time.
6:04 mfs think their in demon slayer.
Fun fact, billionaires and CEO’s actually have almost identical brain patterns to a psychopath. Honestly explains a lot.
Mmmmmmm brain smoothie...... 🤢
Tips for getting used to a cold shower   *Fast way to get used to it*  Make the water as cold as you can then stand under the water for at least 8 seconds. Your body takes a couple seconds to get used to extreme temperatures but once it does you should be fine.   *slow way* Turn your water in your normal temperature and then lower the temperature slightly every 30 seconds it’s slower but if you dint want an extreme shock the this way would be better
I'm reading Crime and Punishment for school rn and the dream segment reminds me of the part when the main character has a dream that a bunch of drunks are beating a weak horse until it's dead and he wakes up from the dream like, "Whew. That was scary. Wait... Am I supposed to kill my pawnbroker?"
Nobody ever:  Billionaires: so my morning routine starts at about 2:30am-
Friendly fire will not be tolerated
🎉
4:45 Billionaires don't have partners and live a lonely life.
Nope, your dreams are definitely trying to fix things subconsciously.  Its just...sometimes you do it wrong...and also your brain has to pretend its not fixing things (for some reason), give the show a little realism.  And also thoughts are complicated.  And also you dont choose what you dream about.  And also sometimes your brain isnt trying to fix things, sometimes its just dreaming.  But other than that, yeah it is.
Old white people  >Early life  Jewish
a lot of people have pointed out that a normal person with a 9-5 doesnt have time to do this but if im being honest, i think thats the point. these people have so much money and are so disconnected from the idea of labor and humanity that they fill their days with all this pointless bizarre busy work to try and squeeze a meaning out of an existence that centers entirely around passively getting the high score in exploitation.
12:05 First dream: You live a busy adult life but you yearn for your adolescence. Second dream: You find amusement in crude behavior and feel like you can get away with it.
Take a shot every time he says brain 💀
And here we are in 2024 where an out of touch elite decided he could prove that the lower class were just lazy by starting over from zero and becoming a millionaire and a year when in reality he was staying on a friend's couch and used his connections he already had in order to benefit so he wasn't actually starting from zero.   Not to mention him ending it early because of health reasons when that's not something people in the lower class can do. In fact most of us can't even afford to go to the doctors to treat side health problems  The obscenely wealthy are so out of touch that they don't even understand how out of touch they actually really are
switch the water for almond/oat milk, add half a banana, and a scoop of protein powder and that smoothie would be soooooo much better  basically a different smoothie lol
A "cold" shower in the Bahamas is not on the same level as a cold shower in Canadian winter, lol.
i think the outer shell can itself can expand?
Kurtis turns Australian at 18:23
Oh Kurtis your worm dream has so many possible meanings.. You missing a flight and watching a movie has multiple meaningd too. The peeing on a hotel bed im stumped by. Vut you have to ask yourself how did these dreams make you feel... 😅
Temu song is playing in my head rn 😅
Does the g in the background stand for greg?
a billionaire's morning isn't complete until you go on Twitter and tweet the dumbest shit I've ever seen that's supposed to be taken seriously.
16:02 "wish i- i'd wish i'd rather us... You know? "
Williams Carol Robinson John White David
22:27 cats would be so much better if Kurtis was the lead
this video’s already 2 years old!?
20:20 that's the mm2 song
16:02 This moment has permanently etched itself into my brain. I stutter and trip over my words a lot and every time I do I just go "You know?" and stop trying to save it and it's entirely because of this
I can say for myself, that I sometimes do find a solution for a problem that I was working on during the day in my dream. So it does happen :D
hello! i am a professional dream interpreter. your peeing dream means that you're pregnant!! have you felt nauseous, had specific cravings, or any other pregnancy symptoms?
Ive followed very condesnced versions of daily routines.  Wake up Bed Make Coffee Meditate 5 - 10 min. While coffe brewed Scheudle day(if needed)  Make quick breakfest Start day  Takes about 20 maybe 30 minutes and it gets me going.
I'm a little late to the party, but: why denounce everything a billionaire does because they're bad for the equality of the lower/middle class, and then endorse a brand that has literally banned its workers from unionizing? Do you think those meals come to your door so fast because of magic or something? They're assembled by heavy labor and long hours. Same for many (if not all) meal services. I love your content but I feel you sometimes virtue signal over things you genuinely don't care about
What I got from this: billionaires are zombies
This dudes morning ritual cost like 45 dollars worth of produce.   Like if your not loaded this is a how to become poor morning ritual.
Tea probably didnt have an effect because coffee has such an insanely high caffeine level it can make you addicted. Tea is at max 40mg, while coffee reaches around 600mg. I dont drink coffee, and i can wake up fairly fine.
does anyone else think that maybe the guy was just listing examples of things to put in a “brain smoothie” and  not saying a recipe so kurtis made a bad smoothie for no reason
10:24 no way, yakub
PLEASE WATCH TOPHIA
1:55 same
13:30 bro sounds like darth vader 💀💀
17:19  “spinage”
Can we get a video of Kurtis eating 252000 worms?
yo that worms dream is pretty straightforward really; your inner self is feeling like you're consuming too much of a bad thing, whether it's junk food or drugs or garbage content or whatever, but you know what it is
Can’t believe Kurtis forgot to put gems in his tea. Totally disrepecting the routine
i’ll give warren buffet a pass bc he’s the reason i, and many other ppl have basically free college 🙏
Guys your not supposed to have a freezing cold shower just like a not warm shower, it can be cool but not freezing cold
Miller Patricia Johnson Betty Davis Donna
18:54 That's what she said
I tought you were kidding that was 2022 it showed up in my fy like now
Imagine your mom dies, but ofc you’re a billionaire with your be HAPPY to-feel list. And you just smile through the whole funeral
I read monkey book😢
This ~billionaire~ read American Psycho once and made it his personality
i had a dream last night that i had a three sum with you and matt rife
Young Laura Perez Eric Allen Anthony
19:28 I am offended.
If it's OK with Ms.Mayor Kurtis mayyyybbbyyyy adopting a cat from a shelter then the introduction journey to your current biological son Kiwi.  Explain how he's gonna be a big brother and how not all kids are birthed from their fathers like he was. How some are drop kicked, punted, yeeted by angels from heaven (all cats) Blah blahblah.
I believe you eat hello fresh just like you believe billionaires do these morning routines
I Kek at the end
NAAAAH BRO IS KILLING THE BILLIONAIRES 😭 god damn
18:16 It looks like s@#, no like it actually looks like s@#$.
Wow Kurtis just farts whenever and yet Danny requires 1 million subscribers on a platform he doesn’t even use anymore for a toot reveal smh
you look like my world civ teacher and i just imagine you teaching me when i'm in that class and it's weird. you act alike too
21:10 OMG I DID THAT FOR A YEAR
i had the same spiderman dream u had but instead i was like a driver and i had to deliver a passanger or smth or help spiderman find someone
Dude I was waiting for the punchline withe the "and yes I am body shaming" thing and it never came. I don't feel betrayed, yet I do.
14:00
Kurtis you didn’t put honey in your smoothie
12:33 professional dream interpreter here, that dream means you want to piss on a hotel bed. Hope this helps!
Davis Melissa Allen William Lopez Gary
Im not a mouth breather so not sure about that breathing stuff. Much healthier to breath throug your nose regardless of how much money i have
2024 rewatch
Off topic but Kurtis' eyes are pretty
“I’m-I’m sure my mental health could be ææehhhhh… better.”  That is the most relatable thing I have heard all year.
I was tabbed into UNDERTALE, just leaving the ruins, before hearing "God, it's so thick."
this is exactly what I imagined Kurtis' handwriting to look like
I predominantly wake up hungover after a 12 hour shift most days ready to get set and go to and for another 12 hour shift.  I gulp down a 500ml can of full fat energy drink and struggle to keep it down…do my shift…come home, usually eat buldak noodles and cheese or a bacon roll then repeat Edit: no, I don’t eat more than once a day…and my feel list consists of constant inner screaming…my spare time is made up of screaming outwardly, loving my dogs, then screaming outwardly again sparingly about the horror I have accepted as my life Edit edit:  FUCKING BRAIN SMOOTHIE!???!:&:8:8;£:9;,£;)6,6372 BEFJD SMJDCJIFTJIEEE!???
don't trust anyone who says ruff instead of roof man
Cold showers are so nice though 💔
no wonder why rich people drink smoothes cu z they spend the entire morning fucken around while you have been at work for 6 hours already
at 28 I've still to figure out the point of making a bed.
Is that… Jacob??? 20:20
Alpha breathing sounds like mewing ngl
Billionaires are all liars.  I don't believe anything they say .
The billionaire in the video sounds like Doug Guller from the undercover boss video 4:06
Imagine if all this guys employees said they won't be in to work until they finish this routine
No one does this every day unless they have nothing but free time and an inflated ego.  Lots of these are great habits that if done correctly can improve your mental health, but some are BS like cold showers.  Never feel bad because you don't journal every day.  Maybe try and do it once a week, it can be super beneficial for things like anxiety, depression, ADHD and more.  But if you don't have the energy one day, that's fine.  You need rest more than you need to journal.  These people will push this narrative of work hard to achieve success but sometimes life just sucks and it's ok to say life fucking sucks.  Infact that's a great thing to journal about lol.  Self improvement is great and healthy habits are awesome but don't feel bad for not doing everything perfectly.
The problem with body shaming isn't that the person you direct it at doesn't deserve it, it's that you're insulting a whole bunch of people who look like them in the way you're insulting will feel bad without having earned it. They just have a big eye or grey teeth.
The guy in the video is NOT getting anything done ever. His morning routine lasts hours at the least. This is just for people who don’t have jobs or have cushy pointless executive posistions that pay absurdly high for little to no work
lost my shit at Jeff Bezos' eyeball - this is gonna be a great video
After studying psychology and specifically dreams for the past 3 years the most common answer to the act of deliberate urination in your dreams means is complicated, I will try and summarise - LiL pIsS BoY
i feel nothing.
I thought this was going to be a Temu product reviews. But thats shopping like a billionaire. ❤
Why do I feel like the thumbnail for this video changed
this is the daily routine of an unemployed person how tf am I supposed to do all that shit and work ?! askdhflajdsf
dang ur alpha breath stinks
In 2024 can't hear live like a billionaire without hearing 'temu' echo after it....
My dear lord. I was going to comment early in the video to say I had a dream last night that I pissed on a table and everyone was watching me then I woke up cause I really needed a piss. Seems I’m not the only freak with piss dreams 😂😂😂
Do cold showers genuinely have the benefits people say they do? Is it a personal preference or can anybody get used to it?
As someone who worked at a smoothie shop you needed more water and blueberries
I tried a cold shower today few hours ago, I forgot to breath right and had to switch the water.   To whoever does that, why so………
I want to see a video where you do your anti-list for a week!
the wildest thing is that, individually, a lot of that morning routine isnt bad practice. your brain does sort stuff out while you sleep, but not *every* dream is important, remembering to remember them is a fine skill to build tho. i used to take cold showers when i had to wake up at 4:30AM in highschool cause it slapped me awake, but it isnt always necessary. doing puzzles periodically does help with mundane small tasks, but doing them daily only does so much for "strengthening" your brain. daily meditation is also good for sorting out your thoughts, but takes routine practice to be able to use effectively for that purpose. fixing your bed every day can be part of a morning meditation! its a mindful small task that takes less than 10 minutes and requires a lot of full body movements to complete. having a todo list each day even if small is a routine i picked up as someone with DID and ADHD who gets off track and unable to remember what track i was on throughout the day. doing these things isnt gonna make you a billionaire, it just makes being alive a bit nicer if done as your ability to do so allows you.
Kurtis love bombing billionaires? Bro ew, I’m trying to eat
i've never heard someone say "tall glass of water" without being referred to a women.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
Purposely peeing on the bed means you are not drink enough water before bed. Also your hands are not wet enough. I recommend to drink about a liter of water before bed and then put your hands in a bowl of water. Enjoy hydration!!!!
Kurtis, stop pretending you aren't a trillionare from insider trading on the Kurtistown stock exchange
Second dream…yea you wanna see spider man again 😢 and peeing on the hotel mattress?? Idk F THE MAN!!!  🤷‍♀️😂 or you had to pee really bad in real life probs
I love interpreting my dreams cause they don’t make any sense either lol had a dream a through a fat blonde lady in an alorgators mouth the other night to save me and my kid 🐊🤷‍♀️😂I felt so bad for the lady but it was her or me and my kid lol  I’m a lucid dreamer, astral projector, and get sleep paralysis when I don’t leave my body. I’m starting to believe I live in actual real dimensions when I’m dreaming because I go back to the same places and dreams every night. Just a theory lol Anyway I wanna try and interpret your dream 😆😁💭 so since you seem to not like worms or any amount of them and the doctor told you you’re eating to many…maybe you feel you’re taking on to much of something in your life that doesn’t feel right to you. Maybe worms in your stomach could mean being full of anxiety and your doctor or subconscious is telling you to stop taking on to much. Aka the worms and eating to much of them. Anyway eitheay I absolutely loveeee your videos! I’m a recent new fan and you always make me laugh 😂 Been going through a rough time lately and I look forward to watching your videos! 😊🫶 thanks for all your hard work and effort you put into making them! You’re so funny and hope I can see one of your stand ups one day!
it is 2024 and it isn't looking great 2022 Kurtis
The number of astroturfed comments on Billionaire Boy's channel is also absolutely mind-boggling. Kind of uncanny tbh
22:01 here in 2024 when chevron was just overturned 😀 kurtis why would u say that
Fun fact: 12 Percent of the US is black But only (Roughly) 1 Percent of billionares in the us are black Hmmm... Interesting While researching this I found out only 2 Women are billionaires and idk if thats true but still pretty interesting Have a nice day BTW :D.
The only reason why I take cold showers is because I overheat easily in the summer. That’s it. Other than that. They suck
So I guess billionaires don’t brush their teeth
Spinach ❌ Spinadge ✅
I thought he was gonna do the beginning of the list without breathing. Unsubbed
Its -20°..... i think thats pretty good cold therapy on its own... if you lived somewhere super ho, it would be substantially more enjoyable... especially after walking the dog in the freezing cold....
The angry millennials socialism is pushing so hard
Wow of course you're going to question this because you just arent committed or serious enough. I do this seriously every day and I'm richer now. Relatively speaking.
lol pouring orange juice in a smoothie is still just a fruit smoothie- what you want is the ICE CREAM!
God ur nose ring is lit! You look really good in that man👏
Alpha breathing! First form: Akimbo Crypto Cripple! *proceeds to cripple your legs and arms with actual coins with the bitcoin B’s on them*
Cool, so as long as you have no children, pets, or disabled family members to take care of, don't have to go to work in the morning or have a long commute, don't live in a food desert, don't live on a budget, and don't have any other responsibilities outside of your job, then this should be a piece of cake and it will definitely set you up for success! 👍
my dumbass read the title of the book in the thumbnail as "monkey book" and i was like:  Yes,yes, the NFTs who could forget that one?
Is that a LPOTL reference at the end?
“You can body shame billionaires.”  Honestly yeah, if you have more money than God, get that shit fixed bro what are you even doing.
2:23 i’d genuinely watch that
Stfu you are spreading hate 🎉
damn kurtis goes diary
“Just drink water and breathe. Just eat blueberries bro”-some dude born into a filthy rich family.
“I couldn’t find any of the shit that billionaire was talking about.” Hahahhaa
The only time recalling your dreams is useful, aside from spiritual reasons, is if you experience nightmares as a side effect of ptsd and/or psychiatric meds. But even as someone with trauma-based nightmares, yeah I don't think my dream where I get kidnapped by Jarvis Johnson means anything.
The other day I had a dream about Jojo Siwa. What on earth is this the solution to????
Paul McCartney is the only Billionaire I like
Emkay brought me hear
6:12 so Box breathing is actually awesome, it’s a technique that is supposed to reduce anxiety. Could not recommend more. It’s a good exercise if you’re anxious, basically you trace along the edges of any square shape near you with your eyes and as your moving your eyes along each side of the square or rectangle, you breath in and out slowly as you move along. It’s great cos it stimulates your brain visually as you subconsciously work on breathing. But ignore the Alpha breathing, I dunno wtf that’s about. 😂😂
As someone with ADHD that morning routine would cost all of my spoons and I could do nothing else
Alpha breathing just looks like you’re trying to become a mouth breather
Don’t people usually pee in real life if they peed in their dream?
when i was about 5 i had a reoccurring dream where my older sister and i were getting ready in the bathroom and she somehow got flushed down the toilet. i went screaming to my parents and they just shrugged and were like "we'll just go pick her up at the beach". so we drove to the beach, and sure enough, she washed up onto the beach. we wasn't gasping for air or anything, she was just chillin while she got pushed onto the shore by the waves. and then we picked her up and went home. if all dreams have meaning, i would LOVE to know what that one means
Kurtis, that was not a Dream, I am your doctor. You are eating way too many worms due 😞🐛
The only "sell" I disagree with purely from personal experience is the tea, doesn't have to be the specific tea from the example but as someone who quit caffeine just for sake of "can I?", not accidentally giving myself the jitters first thing in the morning has been great. Also there are so many different tea flavors, I have one that's chili watermelon just as an example, or just not even have tea, people have come up with so many beverages that aren't caffeinated. Anyway, whoever reads this doesn't have to listen to me or agree, I just wanted to add to the conversation.
27:22 Please tell me what song that is playing!
23:20 i start warm then go down slowly
I love that the guy in the video, the super successful millionaire, says "get up at dawn and make your bed, and Kurtis, the 'less successful' guy, says he can't make his bed because his girlfriend is there. I can't really articulate it, but it's so funny to me😅
cuz they say "do as much work as possible it helps be like me" and the only ever 'become a billionaire/millionare' tutorials are just shit like this that make you lose as much time to work as possible
In order to be a billionaire, the first thing you must include in your routine is rich parents. Never having to worry about money and a small loan of at least half a million. Possibly 1 million or a couple of millions. Who cares? Remember, money is not a problem. That's the important part.
What really cringe is if you look up the guy talking (Jim Kwik) one of the related questions is “Who is the world's best brain coach?”
14:27 - 14:41 the way this is literally my version of exercise lately,, 😭😂
The only billionaire id follow is gt dave bc tmg made jokes abt him and instead of getting pissed he invited them to his house, love a rich guy who can take a joke
18:19 I shall dub it, shrek shit smoothie.
THE ALPHA BREATHING IS MEWING
27:20 he meant tony hawk's underground 2
JOKES ON YOU I LOVE THOMAS
As someone who used to live with a green smoothie maniac, while it will always taste like plants, if you add citrus it's a million times better, I would never swallow it without Orange, lemon or lime juice lol. With citrus it's not the worst as long as you avoid chard.
How many of those billionaires are Indian, Asian, European who moved to America, also…. America is predominantly white. STFU with the white hate already. You aren’t a good person because you shame white people….. you are just a hypocrite
at one point an actual ambulance siren went off out my window and i just assumed it was a sound byte in the video because it just kinda fit
Do billionaires keep a male lions in their backyard for their lion's mane tea?
A cold shower sounds like hell.
Everytime kurtis said cold shower it sounded like gold shower
If you claim that to become a billionaire you have to exploit people, then point out that there are only 7 black billionaires. That would suggest to me that black people are less likely to exploit people. That seems like a compliment
9:47
2:15  not kurtis body shaming with a shirt saying “please be NICE”
The best way how to get money: D get a job
Ive started making my bed every morning since watching this video and its become a small but somehow fulfilling part of my routine. Then i grab a blanket, lay down on it, and take a 40 minute nap :)
I've heard before that taking a hot shower followed by a cold shower helps to tighten your skin. I've heard it's supposed to help with toning and wrinkles. But hey I'm just some guy
god i'd love to play tony hawks pro skater 2 until i pass out from consuming a mountain dew and cosmic brownie simultaneously
Great video as usual, but I can't get past Kurtis mentioning (at 27:19 ) Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 while playing a song from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 ("96 Quite Bitter Beings" by CKY) in the background, lol
my to-list list
4:02 failed the opportunity to do the same pose as the one and only, Barry B. Benson. It honestly would have been so iconic, so I am asking if you may re-create the picture for all of us to admire.
As a female, I won't be needing the red wine.
Remember kids ceos have no correlation with intelligence multiple studies show that ceos tend to be of average intelligence, so don't you worry about needing a "brain smoothie" you just need a good idea and determination 😉
Brain berries for my brain smootie lmaoo wtf
I love dreamong, it is literally my favorite thing
I also had a dream where I wet the bed. Except it was an abandoned cabin in the beach. And I was covering the entire place with gasoline, especially the bed.
Just make sure that you make the bed like an hour or two after getting up otherwise it’s worse for your health due to potentially more bacteria growth
The only reason I take cold showers is because I live in Arizona and it's always so fucking hot that I need to counter balance it with cold showers
If alpha breathing is meant to be relaxing, why does watching you alpha breathe make me stressed?
Can you make your videos faster I’m running out of videos to watch
5:30 5:58 7:15 15:26 18:15 21:13
It's been two years and the lines "And while that wet wet journal is up in flames, you make a to feel list, and you leave it blank. Today, you feel nothing" with the boss music inspire me to be my worst every day <3
Bullshit. You didnt even poison 1 reservoir. Flase advertising
So basically, that guy doesn't work, he's just doing his morning routine all day. Or he's waking up every single day at 3 am to do stuff until 8 am when he's begining to work.
Dawg I need that shirt 15:44
For being such "hard working" and "important" people, billionaires seem to have a shit load of time to screw around all morning  🙃.
10:28 tbh I think that sounds ok.
that beta bit was crazy
Theres actual research that supports the idea that cold showers are better for you in the morning and hot showers are better for you at night
I know that this is two years too late, but, when the best way to take a cold shower for me is to start with a normal shower and then right before I get out I’ll gradually turn it colder and colder. It’s nice
mark zuckerberg? i hardly knowherberg
When does this dude from the video start his working routine?
they are not old white people in fact 40% of them are jewish (only ~2% of the population btw). Jews come from the middle east AND ARE NOT WHITE
Video start 0:01  Video end 30:16
Sorry b, being a good partner was yesterday 🤣🤣🤣
here what you really do go to college that will cost over 200000$ if you cant get into college cus you dont deserve it have you dad make a 2500000$ donation to the college like jared cushner did then have one of your dad friends who owns a huge company hire you so you never need to interview for the job then when some approaches you with a million dollar idea steal in because you already have more funds than them to get there idea onto the market faster your done you are now a billionaire
I think its funny, because if we assume billionaires are made by hard work, this is super counter productive because you not only waste time, that waste of time means you need to take less breaks. Which actually makes you more productive.
Cosmic brownies are the shit!
People who take cold showers are sadists
!/
“We’re not human doings, we’re human beings” is so fuckin funny
Way to rock the jerry curl mullet combo brother love the swag....real swag being authentic keep doing ur thing
Dream explanation  1. You feel like you dont have enough time to do what you want and what gives you happiness, because youre always on the next item. Even though you enjoy what you do, you have the nagging feeling whether youre doing what you want or what you feel you need to do (is your work life in balance?)  1a? You pissing on the bed signifies your reluctance at the status quo. You dont want to follow the rules and take your dreams as an ability to do whatever your free will allows, no matter how absurd. its not about the piss, its about your ability to piss wherever you want. In other words, its your subconscious telling you "No, I do what i want! and if i want to piss, thats my choice!"  2. Even though you like the job you do, it still feels like working in the service industry. Even though you ignore the hateful comments, the sense of entitlement from the customers (audience) gets to you. Comments pushing you do a certain style (or frequency) and then still complaining makes you equate it to working at the service industry and having customers constantly complain.  3, You feel like leaving everything behind, starting over. You want to test yourself and understand if your position is luck or your own hard work.  4. Its strange how You brought alcohol, and You got in trouble. Its never someone else, and youre there. its you. A overexaggerated sense of self importance, i guess. Might mean you feel like your ego is going unchecked, and that sooner or later youll be called out on it?  5.  You feel the need to connect, and have just thought of the name because you heard it and subconsciously thought what would person X be like in real life. it could mean 2 things: - your desire to form meaningful relationships offline, a feeling that youre overdependent on your online persona - a desire to show that you are tolerant enough to hang out with anyone, no matter how obscure they are. its a reflection of self doubt and a check on your own ego    Your dreams show that youre still very unconfident in the type of work you produce. Even though you like it and enjoy making it, you still feel a lot of pressure to perform a certain way. However, being rebellious at heart you constantly consciously or subconsciously search for ways to fight any routine in your life.
he should’ve said cold take on cold showers
dude trust me alpha breathing is crazy, its like normal breathing, but more sexist
0:40 please dont spire me, kurtis
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
why is everyone surprised that kurtis’s house is stylish? he absolutely gives off those vibes, and every set we’ve seen like on VRG and his videos has a great backdrop
rewatching kurt vids helps w my depression episodes💆🏻
Omg temu
4:14 I also do this. Today I had a dream where i was basically giving food to my grandma but then she didnt wabt to eat it and kept demanding pasta, i was like girl we dont hv pasta but she just kept getting more and more angry. Then all the cupboarfs and the fridge and windows all started opening and closing and i was freaking out, i kept screaming for my parents but they werent responding, i went to check up on them and they were putting aloe vera fac3 masks. Then i went back down and continued freaking out. Eventually my parents cared enough to come downstairs and told me my grandma actually has superpowers and could open doors whenever she wanted. Then i woke up. Truly a meaningful dream that should be studied.
i really only take cold showers in the summer time. 👍🏼
the alpha breathing really scared me, please don't ever do that again
1:53 okay but I have that too when i smile... It looks so bad
0:21 this sounds terrible when you watch this video two years later while in Russia💀💀
How do cold showers even work? In my experience it's incredibly difficult to get soap off your body and shampoo out of your hair using cold water.
Recalling your dreams can actually make it so then you can recognize you're in a dream, and therefore can lucid dream  Also they sometimes produce interesting stories
fucking dying at the alpha smiling shit
...A game theory
This whole video feels like being in a mental ward with Kurtis (fellow crazy bitches know what I mean lmfao"
"Dreaming about eating worms may symbolise disgust or revulsion towards something in your waking life." 🪱
22:22 for a second i thought he said hes a good pisser
i had a dream i got xanax and the went to a daycare for autistic children (as an autistic child) and then my dad came back and i played ukulele for him
This reeks of salty poor loser
Kurtis has unfortunately made me neutral evil. Him saying “And yes, i AM body shaming” because I wasn’t even gonna say anything. I was cracking up at the first roast😂
1 years after post , I’m comment 9111
KURTIS THIS IS YOUR DOCTOR YOU ARE EATING TOO MANY WORMS
I know this video is kinda old, but for the record: the reason body shaming is never ok, even when it's about someone like Jeff Bezos (who I'm not defending) is because when you make fun of someone's physical appearance (especially in a public forum), you're not just making fun of that one person, you're making fun of everyone who shares the physical trait that you're making fun of. You're not just making fun of Jeff Bezos for having differently sized eyes, you're sending the message to everyone watching this who has differently sized eyes that you think they all look weird.
And you leave it blank...Today you feel nothing (*mean face) :D
This sketch actually reminded me when I used to work back in the 1980s. Yeah I’m old. They had these magazines for blue-collar or white collar workers and broke college grads about work and how to succeed. Articles on how to network, how to write a résumé, etc. but on the cover they always had these millionaires standing in front of their personal jets or standing in front of their luxury mansions. Like most people who read these magazines will never ever have that. I don’t think they understood who their demographic was.
as a sudoku player, it hurts to hear "fuck sudoku" 💔
Your shower is so bougie
Me watching this in 2024:👁👄👁😂😂😂
Most billionaires don't show up lists because they keep out of the media, they just own companies/shares in big companies and keep to themselves.  There's probably more than 7 black billionaires, you just don't hear about them because they're not public figures.
This whole video I thought Kurtis had a boogie in his woogie. Turns out it was just his nose ring and I just wasn't seeing the rest of it outside of his nose. I'm sorry for judging
Kurtis describing his dream about his doctor being mad over him eating too many worms and saying that doesn't mean anything 2 minutes after talking about how he's the most out of shape he's ever been and his diet is out of control is the funniest thing I've seen in a minute
The breathing guy reminds me of that billionaire from don't look up.
The fact that these people are wiping their asses with $100 when $100 could go along way for us “poor people” boggles my mind. Like how do you have that much money, like they just out there wasting money or spending like some gold toilet paper with like a million dollars
If I live like a billionaire will I be able to become a billionaire?
the only advertisement i got on this video where online trading for the 500. the same ad over and over again…
16:04 is the funniest thing i’ve ever seen
AN AVOCADO IN A SMOOTHIE??
0:03 HOW DO YOU WRITE LIKE YOUR RUNNING OUT OF TIME?! (I’m a nerd)
1:58 and yes I am body shaming. Too real Kurtis. Too real.
Why does he say spinnage
I was taking a hit of weed when you showed Mr Diggory. Made me laugh. I coughed for like a solid minute. 😅😂
6:19 small note on the "alpha breathing": it's actually most better for you to breathe through your nose. your nose is literally for breathing. breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth is the REAL alpha breathing
"Alpha breathing" sounds and looks like something Patrick Bateman would do.
Back when I was about 10 or so I had a friend I would play Xbox with (like, OG Halo 1 and 2 chunky controller XBOX). The controllers had those memory card slots in the back or whatever they were, idk I never used em. My friend was particularly gullible so I managed to convince him that, on the Halo 2 map Headlong, if he stood in the corner of the large tunnel barrier and blew into the back of the controller it would trip a sensor in the controller and unlock that door, leading to a Scarab Gun. When 2 minutes passed and it didn't work I told him that his breath might have too much CO2 in it and to diffuse it with a cardboard paper towel tube. He blew on that shit for 3 more minutes before I felt bad and HAD to tell him I was fucking with him.  Minus the confession, this is what these billionaires are doing. They are making these "life help" tips to see what they can get gullible, usually single, depressed men to do. Bezos is taking a nice hot shower in a bathroom that costs as much as a 2b/2b house with a smile because he knows a bunch of men who have accomplished nothing were taking cold ass showers at 7am. It's a sick prank taking advantage of the gullible.
I too, am impervious to becoming a billionaire
:)
How to be a billionaire = "how to be human" is so real like wtf??! We bringing back the lizardpeople or what like are they fucking robots..?
wow so much inteligent
Does anyone know the song at 27:21? I hear it all the time but I can never find the name
In brazil everyone takes cold showers, but I'm still not a billionaire...
As a smoker. I took the teeth one kind of personally  …. …. …. …. …. Any way great video ❤
Lmao spinidge
I actually drink a similar smoothie, I recommend swapping out the water for coconut water and lemon juice. More sugar and more acid really improve the flavor and help cover up the spinach flavor better.
Hey how about instead of stuffing billionaires into a locker we stuff them into a submari- *Cancelled*
I love how needlessly literal Kurtis’ interpretation of the smoothie was. The list given was example foods, and he decided that was all that was allowed in the smoothie, resulting in 7 terrible smoothies.
Bleh. I wash my hair in cold water sometimes. But like…The rest of my body is not a part of that shower.  Hard no.
For smoothies I would recommend strawberry, blue berry's, black berry's, and orange juice! It is delicious
Technically, your body doesn't consider your eyes  A part of the body(if your body become aware of your eyeballs it will try to attack it/destroythe "foreign body"), so technically you weren't even body shaming, you were eye shaming(which in this case was so super valid)
You didn't follow the instructions correctly, that's why it didn't work
The whole alpha breathing is the same idea as mewing - which are both common tips you can get from your dentist
I tried kurtis’s morning routine and safe to say I feel so good I could do a backflip on the edge of a 10 story building would to again 😆🥳🤩
As a professional dream interpreter, I can say that without a doubt, you had a dream
Only people without real lives can do this silliness. I start work at 8:30 and i have 3 things done by 9am. This rich idiot's morning routine is a full morning, after which he has lunch, sends three emails, and finishes his day believing he is hard working.
Before I watched this video I genuinely thought brain smoothie meant a smoothie made of brains
THAT'S MY SON! THATS MY BOY! Had me laughing so loud 😂😂
Writing down your dreams and stuff actually helps you lucid dream, so you can dream about being a billionaire, I guess.
i tried that
His routine is actually the routine of Marcus Aurelius…
dang ur alpha breath stinks
9:47 actually I am a human doing. Human doing this guys mom.
Am i crazy or does the narrator sound like Ryan Reynolds??
Kurtis! This video was so unbelievably funny, you literally had me rolling my dude!
I feel terror every time he says anything with "er" at the end of it.
HEY U BREATHED BEFORE THE "BREATH" STEP!!!!
I work at mcdonalds, my shift today was literally just working the frier and grill
If you are peeing in your dream where you feel like you need to pee in a dream you either are peeing in real life or you need to go pee
where’s my extra greeting:(
I’d love a Kurtis video where he just ATTACKS billionaires
dang, ur alpha breath stinks.
It’s not dreams it’s self that solve problems from the previous day but during N3 and REM sleep your subconscious does solve problems. These two stages are during dreams.
Eat the rich
"To win the morning is to win the day" or whatever he said is such bullshit. I wake up at 6 and iron my shirt and do my good boy shit in the early hours. So that after like one PM I've done most if not all I needed to do and if I don't have work that day too I'll just be a gamer degenerate for the rest of the day. I win the morning so that I can lose the day.
I like my cold showers not freezing me to death
Kurtis, next time make the smoothie but use almond milk, a cup of yogurt and some soft honey. It’ll taste much better and you can always put ground flaxseed into your smoothie.
Would you rather:  - be a billionaire - be a billionaire with a bee
I’m so high right now, this shit is so fucking funny
Ive never heard it called alpha breathing before😂😂😂😂 thats stupid😂  But it is something ive been doing for years to help me be able to breathe easier when i work out
THIS GIVES ME A GOOD GIGGLE
Grapefruit juice would have been healthier in the smoothie than water
13:35
whats crazy is that these billionaires are able to take the time out of their day to do this, BECAUSE theyre billionairs!!
Sigma breathing :D
Hot showers mess me up because of eczema.... I'm trustworthy, I promise!
okay i used to HATE cold showers but i now love them. i always get way too hot or sweaty cause my country is uncharacteristically hot and humid rn. i feel like im currently constantly sweaty. so recently it has been so nice
That shower head…that shower head is perfect. I would shower under it, cold or hot. It looks like it would feel like standing outside during a gentle drizzle 🌧️ 😊
Awh Kiwi is so cute!! 🥝
The calm uncomfortable screaming in the shower scene reminds me of my cat when I used to give him baths after being outside lol
Spinag
the original video (without the weird stock videos) was actually shown at my school this week and i can say that the man saying it looked like an alien
How would one do this routine if they have a partner and kids? Idk I hear from all my friends w kids that mornings wouldn't work like this lol it's usually chaos
You enjoy recreational GOLF? But NOT reading? You can read like where the wild things are or any book
Jay-Z came from being impoverished in the projects & slinging hard drugs to becoming the first rapper worth over a billion. he, Oprah & Tyler Perry are probably the only ones I admire for their work ethic
damn he has weird dreams
Kurtis Connor is the reason every few months I try to grow a mustache despite it always looking terrible on me.
4:14 im gonna be honest here  my dreams are weird as fuck
Sometimes I take cold showers (usually I just take cool to warm showers), but it's mainly because I don't like to be cold when I get out of the shower lol
the irony of kurtis for calling the dude out for turning his video into an ad just to do the exact same thing
okay but the wim hoff breathing method is actually sick
I do your morning routine! Minus the wine cause I've got a toddler with me so the time lol. Thomas the tank engine doing really does make me think about all my mistakes too it's so weird you said that. I wonder why that is.
I think he was making it up as he said it
The "morning routine" is an excellent look into how little effort rich people need to put into their work life. No minimum wage worker has time to do 80% of that stuff.  A real morning routine is wake up, make your bed with minimum effort, put on coffee, take a barely warm shower because you don't have time for it to heat up, get out and pour your coffee into a travel mug and drink it on the way to work and there you go.  Rich people hardly spend time working because they have employees to do everything for them so they can "meditate" and be mindful of all the lives they are making a living hell with no remorse.
he should put “body shame a billionaire” on a shirt for merch
I feel like the guy in the how to video kurtis was watching was just making shit up as he went, like I make a to do list, oh and I’m a human so to feel list, and I to be, I drink water and also brain smoothie and read a book and oh yeah this and that and bullshit pull yourself up by your bootstraps you peasant
Me when I do 20 minutes of medication
Billionaires dont breathe, this is true, as most of them are litterally shit wrapped in skin.
living in a hot country a cold shower is the best part of my day
Not me also having Bezo eyes 😭
BASIC BITCHES (for men)
Wait. Wait. How is this man able to be a billionaire and drink and avocado everyday
It would be efficient if you just did it all in one. You can also medication in the cold shower. So those 20 mins to 35 can be just one long shower with medication, doing a mental to do list while you wash. You can also buy a wet notepad to do a to feel list in the shower. I feel like a lot of these actions can be done all together in the shower. Like I can drink brain tea and do a to feel list. Ex I can drink the brain tea while I journal.
I feel like it will be efficient if you move the recall dreams and the breath exorcise into the 20 min meditation. And just do it all in one. You can also medication in the cold shower. So those 20 mins to 35 can be just one long shower with medication and a good wash.
i think it’s called alpha breathing because it sounds like you hiss when you do it
You can body shame someone if you don't have as much money as them. What a braindead take lol
Pretty sure billionaires don’t make their own bed, tea, or smoothies lmfao; doubt they even pour their own glasses of water 😂
me in 2023 watching this knowing that 5 billionaires infact did get stuffed into a locker and rode down a mountain, it was just underwater
shouldve made the brain smoothie with an actual brain
15 things and not 1 was brushing his teeth... the morning breath must be insufferable
yeah so uh the dream thing might not work for me because if i think about my dreams too much i dont feel like im real so i might have to cross that one off of my billionaire morning routine for now
Its so therapeutic to hear kurtis clown on billionaires every 30 seconds😂 i need this as an asmr
15:12 more like COLD TAKE. amiright
The overall advice is kind of okay? Exercise, plan your day, take care of your physical and mental health. Except you really need a lot of time to organize it into routine
I have watched this video so many times
Kurtis making fun of rich guys with a “please be nice” shirt is so funny to me
theres a 9 minute version now. recreate this video with the new one please.
0:30 what the fck how did he know?
No you did not.
dude, billionaires don't know how to do a decent smoothie! that's why they are strange. mix oatmeal with water, then u get a veggie milk. after it, put the avocado (brazilian ones are the best!), ice, a little bit of honey, a bit of fresh peppermint and mix it. if u freeze, will look like ice-cream. and u can put some better fruits, like mango, apple, papaya or an watermelon. and it's gonna be thick, but not "ewww". and u have cinnamon and vanilla extract that can be used (only if want).
Just because someone is rich doesn't mean they aren't human. This is also funny coming from someone who is able to afford niceties and able to make more than 95 percent of the population while  having a flexible work schedule. Some people don't have that privilege so maybe check yourself before making fun of rich people because you are no doubt we'll off yourself.
apparently the video he’s watching isn’t even about a billionaire’s routine (according to user alexagraham7543), but about someone who was just passionate about brain health. so there’s that
I don't know why seeing kurtis' face after he's woken up was so surprising😭😭 I wasnt expecting him to look puffy and Sleepy I guess
Since billionaires can afford plastic surgery then yes you can shame them
before this video i had never heard mark zuckerbergs voice and he sounds like an ai trying to replicate human voices
we use the same water filter...er? I dunno whatever
I like how he says spinidge instead of spinach
Last night I dreamed about some kid with no legs bouncing around like a veggie tale. His mom came up to me and said that in order for him to walk I’ll have to cut off a leg and slap cheese on his butt and that a friend of mine did it already. Why do I need to recall that dream to be a billionaire
the thought that billionaires only need to breathe one time a day for a little bit is so funny
Fuck you I love cold showers. Then again I do live in the 100 degree subtropics so that probably has something to do with it.
🤣🤣🤣 i just love how you rip apart these billionaires... they have no idea what reality is. No one should be allowed to have that much money... its sickening. So no i dont have any fukin sypathy for them. They are fukin evil people. Except for the like 2% of them that have charities and give back to children and animals and people with diseases and so on...  Wouldn't that be kind?   These people are just insane.
i always take cold showers, love em
Now go in a submarine
I had to skip the breathing portion bc I was wildly uncomfortable 😂😂
I found out about you about a week ago and bro you constantly make me involuntary laugh. Gifted
The "To Feel" list feels like it might be useful for somebody with anxiety or depression who needs to try to feel more... positive feelings. Thinking about trying it to try and get out of this depression and anxiety how I've been living in for a month.
Duuude my name is the same as your dog
help the “real” morning routine im tap dancing
OH MY GOD THE PICTURE OF MARK ZUCKERBERG ON A SURFBOARD 😭
This guy's really boring and the abuse of stock footage is not helping  Love ya Curty
nothing goes harder than Kurtis staring into the camera saying "Today, you feel nothing."
“We’re not human doings, we’re human beings!☝🏻🤓💯”
Bullying billionaires is alright. They can afford therapy.
Cool
I like cold showers
As a billionare, we do not do this. Every morning I wake up and laugh at ads about people in poverty, post on Twitter every hour about each charity I donate a dollar to (but say I donated a million) and use my underpaid house servants as punching bags to exercise and get better at punching homeless people who beg for jobs.
I was just rewatching this and it reminded me of the time I dreamt me and Drew Gooden were Ellie and Joel from TLOU, just in my city in Italy. And there were no zombies. We were just running from something.  What that mean?
Ur definitely getting to the crazy billionaire bit by not starting the puzzle with the outside 😟
i hate that i know this but the cold shower and breathing are actually very benefisal just look up  wim Hoff  and you can do it correctly ( i only know any of this bc of my mom ) this does actually help, but i think mostly for depression or things like that.
i’m disappointed kurtis did not try cocaine in this video
As someone who drinks a cuo of tea pretty much every day, I recommend doing it at night. It helps you get up (gotta pee), it keeps your mouth from getting dry while trying to sleep, and it taste...okay. I would recommend chamomile!
Meditation is nice
A cooking channel commented on how people get so heated when arguing about tiny things about cooking, and he said it's because we're focused on it so we can consider tiny things like that. I think this applies to this dumb billionaire routine. When it's really the only thing you do, you can focus on it and make a checklist of tiny stupid things to do
18:40 he looked so defeated while drinking that smoothie😭
I guess billionaires dont brush their teeth?
Elon Musk's dad owned an emerald mine The richest man was never self made. The only self made men are trans men
Wearing a Harvard hoodie without attending it seems like a billionaire move too
should i do your veirsin
18:31 he looks so sad🥺
Why does kurtus look so sad it’s like he is about to cry 18:41
Billionaires want u to think the average person will become one with enough effort so the laws take it easy on their ludacis amounts of wealth because the average person wants to be a billionaire and they don't want the system to take some of their imagined future billions.
"your dreams are your brain solving problems" yeah ok bud let me rq type up the dream I had last night  my dream was about a dude playing/living a horror game that i don’t think exists but it’s very similar to the backrooms? except it’s infinitely generated floors of a building that makes no sense, there’s hotel rooms and bathrooms and stuff, and the floor the dude i was dreaming about was on also had a pool. after you sleep you have a certain amount of time to scavenge before the enemies show up. the main enemy is a mascot but idr what animal, he’s mostly chill and will have a nice conversation with you (can only make gestures though) but if you anger him he will eat your eyes. there’s also an enemy that doesn’t go into rooms unless he hears you, he wanders the hallways listening for you. there’s an enemy that makes you unable to sleep (haunts your brain) but you can skip to scavenging time when he appears. there were also other enemies i didn’t see, plus other people. i’m not sure what the food situation is like but the water situation sucks, there’s tap water but most of it will kill you instantly. fruit flavored tap water is safe though, and the dude was living in a public restroom style room, sleeping across the three sinks that didn't have the fruit water. i’m not sure why but the guy my dream followed really wanted to work his way up the floors, and when he decided it was time to move up a floor he like,, broadcasted from his phone that he had extra pineapple flavored water by typing the lyrics to that one pina colada song into what seemed like social media for this place?? and then looked at cameras to see that there was a dude clinging to a log in a pool. the next very logical step from there was to leave a tin can full of pineapple water in the middle of the hallway, then he walked into a room that looked like a solidly decent hotel room with two double beds and a bathroom (no kitchen, I don't think there were kitchens at all in this universe) and shot a man that lived there despite not previously having a gun????????? and then he stole the dead guy's stuff and I woke up when he finished filling his backpack  what does this tell me
its kinda funny how billionaires dont realize their calling themselves out by sharing these ‘routines’, they literally just have nothing to do in the morning unlike normal people
Me and Kurtis have the same tv :DD
nahhh not me taking a full ass year to realise that the reason these rich and successful people make their beds is bc nobody sleeps with them 💀💀   ...or bc they're gone before morning
“All dreams have a meaning” I had a dream that I went to a Will Wood concert and then he was my friend or something and idk something happened and then he was in my car and I got his phone number. What does this mean.
Why were you reading the book backwards?
Finding out Kurtis did this for absolutely no reason because the narrator isn't even a billionaire is the best thing ever
Omg the first thing I do when I wake up si recall my dreams 😭😭 I feel like such a loser now
Figures that all billionare alpha male types are mouth breathers XD
Now kurtis all you need to do is go on a submarine
I came here to leave a comment saying "but did you shop at temu?"   And then the first thing i see is the ad... FOR TEMU SAYING 'SHOP LIKE A BILLIONAIRE ' those bastards beat me to it.
That was not a dream, Kurtis. I have you on my personal security footage pissing on my hotel bed.
Bro as someone who had cold showers for a while, I look back at myself and kinda want to stab him.
Umm where’s my extra greeting?….
You forgot to go on a submersible
Cold showers are amazing! I love laughing maniacally in the freezing cold trying to convince mywelf that the qater is actually just so hot that it feels cold!
bestie, do i have news* for you  *billionaires are already stuffing themselves into metal tubes that i guess you could ride**  **if you learned how to survive under intense water pressure
Actually yeah my dreams do solve my problems like how when I was younger I had a dream I was in a ninja museum and there was a toilet exhibit and I used it… you can see where that went it did solve my real world problem
rewaching this after the billionaire submarine trip thing and..... no comments lol
Make that routine into a tiktok
your dreams actually do (to some degree) reflect in your daytime actions. However, your dreams are distorted enough to where 99% its nonsense. “recalling your dreams” in this case is usless, because your just recalling nonsense most of the time.
BRO I HAD THE SAME BED PISSING DREAM
Great vid. Just so you know Hello Fresh is actively using union busting and worker exploitation.
1:36 more like davey jones locker 💀
I think it's time for a part 2 where Kurtis goes down into the ocean in a submarine to view the Titanic
As a woman, I am trying to calculate how he fits his hair and makeup into this routine
funniest video yet omg
I feel he is going to scream that the billionare is understimating his power and go deal with padawans.
Chele Mamon pero profesional
Ok, cold showers are good when it’s scorching out
dude you look rich af already, that shower? that kitchen? a velvet chair reading nook? screams wealthy
People say they have that much Money so they do Not Look stupid. German Supermarket aldi has a Lot more Money then all American billionairs together, Not even investdd in stocks... Not counting the Automobile industry and others.
My cat is also called Kiwi :)
this aged poorly
the sheer privilege it has to take to be able to say you want to do three things in a day??😭. worlds and worlds apart
now you have to go into a submarine to see the titanic!
okay, right off the bat... does this routine include a submarine...
Just add more water to the smoothie.
Not the best idea to watch this rn....
watching this after the submarine has been found
whats left is a one way ticket to the titanic
5:45 didn't age well
now all he needs is a submarine 😝
Bro warren buffet has donated over 50 billion dollars. dont trash on him.
aged kinda bad…
kurtis i’m making whipping cream outside at 7am
Trying to do the alpha breathing with you and erupted in laughter. This is too funny 😂😂
Meditation is great its like being able to tranquilize yourself on command.
thats a lot of worms
and now you are trapped underwater haha L
The guy with a mullet and a pathetic mustache whining about billionaires? Nooo waaaay...
I take cold showers, I have a sensitive stomach so the hot water makes it hurt. (I don’t take fully cold showers, theirs enough heat to keep the cold the same )
im a billionaire and i dont like cold showers ☹😟
once i had a dream kurtis and yunggravy bought me a weed cosmo brownie from trixie mattel, and then i got so high i fell through the floor and turned into a dragon (i’ve never smoked anything can you tell)
Don’t you need a billion dollars to live like a billionaire
I think pissing in the hotel bed means you shouldn't travel right now
The only time I ever had a cold shower was when I had heatstroke and it was the only way I could stop throwing up. Any other reason is untrustworthy.
my life  1) wake up 6:30  2) do make up  3) eat breakfast  4) go to school  5) go to part time and make $15 an hour to get yelled at by tweens and middle age women  6) remove make up/do skincare  7) eat dinner  8) mountain of assignments  9) sleep (11-12:30am)
It’s also really dangerous to tell people that every morning has to look the same. Some mornings you might wake up late and sit in bed on your phone for half an hour, some mornings you might get right up go for a jog or get something done. That’s okay! Progress is not linear and starting your day differently than you intended does not mean the day is ruined!
A grwm but with kourtus corner
Yeah people don’t usually start with 20 minutes of meditation you gotta work up to that
this made me laugh so hard i fart it
Oh fuck you for turning this into an ad!
i like how the intro is so fucking intense and then just "ALRIGHT F👏LKS"
Lol Hello Fresh goin real hard with shit like "will cut food waste by 25% vs going to the grocery store". I use everything I buy. Learn to plan and shop and grocery store home cooking is definitely always cheaper and no more wasteful.
I like to take cold showers because then I can pretend I'm showering in a waterfall like a wild animal, which really puts me in the right mindset for my day.
Cool video.
4:35 I mostly dream about being back in school, showing up half an hour late for a lengthy test and then having trouble focusing on the test. As my paper is about to be snatched away, I wake up drenched in sweat. I have never showed up half an hour late to anything, I've never even had trouble finishing a paper so I have no idea what problem my brain is trying to solve 😂
I was fully expecting kurtis to hold his breath from he woke up until finishing his glass of water
Anyone gonna tell him to put ice in his smoothie
Alpha breathing is bitch ass beta breathing.. BITCH!!  ...What? Someone already made that joke?  ...I'll go home!  XD  You rock, Kurtis!  Best Mayor, EVER!! EDIT:  OMG OMG GREG, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! EDIT 2: I am now apparently Greg Hawkeye Renner...
Bro this guy’s stupid socialism ideas are annoying
regarding the cold showers - i almost always take cold showers because to get warm water in my house you need to heat it up with a fireplace and it takes like 4 hours to get mild water. also i dont like taking a 10 minute walk to the forest for wood to light the fireplace
was really excited to watch kurtis wake up think about his dreams make his bed drink his water and take his probiotics…THEN breathe
That video reminded me of all the nurses in the psych ward saying shit like "Alright guys, today we're gonna make a FEEL WHEEL" And I was just fucking terrified
bro what this was a year ago? i remember watching this whennit first came out
According to Sigmund Freud, those dreams mean you want to have sex with your dad.
18:55 that's what she said
i tried alpha breathing and kept bursting into extreme laughter
9:11 caught me so off gaurd omggg HFASK;;LSAHGLAH AND THE TIMESTAMP IS 9:11
Are there just as many black people as there are white people? If the billionthing was even by numbers, wouldnt that make black people more successful than white people statistically by race?
Curtis, be careful calling Billionaires White, Jews aren't White
Im suprised he didnt pee the bed when he peed in his dream
On god i wish i could take hot showers, my blood pressure is naturally super low so hot showers make me faint most of the time so i'm forced into a hell of lukewarm/cold shower hell.. 😔😔
As someone that recalls my dreams, I felt really offended watching this video.
Dang your alpha breath stinks (your skin looks really good and it pisses me off)
I only have one negative thing I want to say, and that's no- it's not okay to bodyshame billionaires just because you know how far removed they are from the rest of us. Body shaming one person isn't just bodyshaming one person, you're shaming everyone who has a body or traits similar to them, which doesn't require being a billionaire asshole. Anyone can have bodies or physical traits similar to billionaires, so you're shaming all of them in the process of shit talking the 1%'s bodies. There's a billion (literally) things you can shit on billionaires for, and reasonably so, all of them are detached and exploitative assholes; It's not a valid argument to think that their bodies are different from everyone elses and justify making fun of them. loved the rest of the video btw, just wanted this here
Dude kurtis why are you so funny. Like no joke. Laughed so hard in this video
I went to a private middle school. Every SINGLE day for 30 minutes straight we had to meditate, and journal, and do a personal reflection. That reflection had to be written with a minimum of 100 words. Sounds extreme, in reality, it was super good for us tbh
When I saw the image of mark Zuckerberg surfing or whatever he was doing, I immediately coughed, which then triggered a sneeze, which then made me immediately get my period 💀
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Awe guys! This video was from back when only stockmarket people cared about inflation hahaha...haha..ha..*cries in poor*
i NEED  the shirt hes wearing at 15:36
after kurtis took a sip of his tea and stumbled over his words i knew exactly what he meant
Typical Canadian, having a doctor in both the dream world and real world
I swear, I'm impressed if cold showers work for you but that is completely freaking insane to me, when temperature goes below 23 degrees Celsius or so, I have to sit in the bathtub for around 20 minutes boiling myself for my fingertips to stop hurting and my nails to not be purple. Sometimes there's a light breeze in the bathroom which makes me still feel cold after it and, just like you said, I am PISSED after that. Just ferally angry. Fuck cold showers, they can only work if it's like 40 degrees outside.
i freakin heckin LOVE water, but it's also looking like i have some kidney issues that i can't afford to have looked at so
I had a dream that kurtis was in my bathtub working as a McDonald’s employee
How to be a billionaire:  Use a couple million dollars to start a business.  Hire workers  Make sure they have part time positions so you don't have you give them benefits  Pay them as little as you can get away with  If it's legal, hire children so you can pay them less  Sell products that break frequently so people have to frequently go back  Expand when you make enough money  Rinse and repeat
My job involves my constantly moving, and I ride my bike to work, so I don't think I need two extra minutes of moving in the morning
Ok when is the video coming out about the insanity of the Cats movie?
What's the song at 27:21? I remember it vividly from my childhood but have spent the last 15 years failing to find it anywhere. Please help!
Let’s petition for kurtis to make a video just roasting old rich guys
He never said to brush his teeth
dang ur alpha breath stinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks
F these fake scam advices, they wouldn't make these if people wouldn't fall for them over and over. For one these are useless and obvious advices. Basically: stay mentaly and physically fit, eat healthy, be productive and organized every day and rest plenty. People shouldn't watch videos like this, these things are obvious. These people never had to wake up each day 4-5 AM go to a crappy job and come home at the end of the day stressed and tired. These advices have the same energy when arrogant people say "i like traveling", well everybody likes traveling but the rest don't have the time or money to do it.
these money dicks want to tell you how to sleep, eat, drink, feel, dream, etc... it is all just bullshit that makes them feel better about making a million times more than the entire group of people that actually produce the goods and or services.
i didn't think there could be anything grosser than a blueberry, avocado, lettuce smoothie, but turns out just thinking about a cosmic brownie mountain dew smoothie is making me feel ill so thanks!
Curtis I had dream that u were doing a show and then I guy from my school tripped or smt he was makin a ruckus? And you were staring at him and asking if he was ok then you ran off stage then everyone was sad :( then u came back in a shark costume???? So nobody would know it was you- I don’t know either 🤷‍♀️
please make a video where you just body shame billionaires
Last night I dreampt I was in a camp run by billionaires and we had to use salt to ward them off like demons. Can someone please decode that dream for me 😭😭 I was also semi-blind for most of the dream and they had cameras everywhere to make sure we weren’t doing anything wrong or else they’d take our plates so we’d have to ask for another one. We had kitchens in our cabins and we had to cover the stoves in salt so they wouldn’t take them. Melatonin is crazy
9:12  the life of a middle school student
Well i dont agree with the fact that billionaires don't work they have a easy life. My friends father is millionaire and a successful businesses man and he works a lot. He never comes home on Christmas or any new year eve as he works hard always, his eyes are all stressed and red he sleeps less ig and he looks tired. Its not easy for them to reach there but ya after reaching there they may become lazy. Overall it takes a lot of efforts to get there too.
Lol, a billion dollars is the equivalent of the USA average salary for 18 000 years...
What!!! Billionaires don’t poop in the morning ???!!! Or all day...???
Smooth Segway to sponsorship
As an avid enjoyer of cold showers the whole reason I like them is because every hour of the day it’s hot af so taking a hot shower makes me feel like I’m gonna boil alive. So cold water like combats the heat ❤
“Today you feel nothing” I’m TRYING 😔
kurtis’ handwriting is so endearing
i have walmart melatonin dreams. I don't know how to process that shit
dont worry 2023 is going okay….yeh….
⚠️6:37 JUMPSCARE WARNING ⚠️
bro needs a morning routine to remind him that he is pretending to be human
here from ottawa twat
Well. Alpha breathing is officially the stupidest thing I’m going to learn about this month.
im on the first day and your dreams are the funniest shit ive ever heard
I do actually on a regular basis listen to the thomas the tank engine theme on full blast in my car because I genuinely just really enjoy the jam
PLEASE DO MOTHER OF THE DAY ON PEACOCK, THE FUNNIEST WORST MOVIE IVE SEEN. i want you or jamie french to live in this world with me. so im sorry for commenting this comment on so many videos. YOURE WELCOME!
When it’s stupid hot like 35 degrees out Celsius ( I am also Canadian and yes it get hot here it’s not frozen outside all year round) a cold shower can feel really nice.
Ewwww to feel list
Please please please What is the name of the song that plays over the tony hawk clip? It's killing me
Did I really just hear you complain that there's only 7 black billionaires in America lol YOU 🙌 ARE 🙌 A 🙌 🤡
Kurtis' recommended morning routine at the end took me out, that was so funny oh my god.
The sad things there are people who actually believe work lifts you out of poverty.
Haha I just watched Harry Poopter omg 😅 “That’s my boiiii” me and my father were saying that all day, actually cried at that scene. He didn’t need to die but he became Edward after so it’s fine. ( yes F off y’all I still at home as a college student :)
I grab a natural valley granola bar, some solid protein powder and barley keep my ADHD stable haha…. We concur, we drink water, we devour!! Hahaha
it is 2023 the prequel to 2021
I'm obsessed with mushrooms and I know a lot of stuff about mushrooms so when I heard that there was lion's mane in his tea I got really excited ( by the way lion's mane is a tipe of mushroom.🍄🍄
The billionaire's routine is exactly what I did during summer vacation when I was a clinically depressed teen and absolutely not a billionaire
so the three top to-do list thing IS actually super helpful- especially for someone with depression. it makes you prioritize better what absolutely needs to be done and helps you from freezing by seeing a huge list of things to do. whenever I do a top 3 list I always end up getting more things done and feeling more accomplished.
Why would a billionaire ever be working?  If I was a billionaire, I would just disappear and hang out all day in places. Occasionally fly to some place. Hang out there.  Maybe volunteer all day. Get a job at a tea shop making minimum wage and just drink tea and sell tea.
Pro tip: Don't *start* with a cold shower. Start with a regular shower, then at the end you slowly turn the temp down until you get to cold. Much easier to handle that way 😊
13:22 he looks like Nancy from the Craft 💀
i would watch a video entirely of kurtis recalling his dreams, they're great
Love the ”please be nice” sweater while throwing all shade possible at the billionares 🤣
4:15 A dream is a solution I'm working on in the night?? Anyone know what it means when your dream looks like a scam mobile game then switches to you playing red light green light with an ice witch to get to a white door? I need the solutions here.
2:33 This is 100% not true. What you need is luck, or someone else who has luck. Skill is a part of it I guess but that's just the basics and luck is like... a bigger part!
Brain smoothie
When billionaires realize that bathing in colder water doesn’t wash out soaps and stuff out of your hair and everything
I have been laughing non stop esp at the "moving your body in the morning" bit omg
"he's got overcast in his mouth, dude" yeeeesh gottem
We need billionaires to do this in reverse. I wanna see Elon Musk wake up at 5am, go to work at 7am, come home at 9pm, realise he's done fuck all to progress his life, and just made money for someone else while making next to nothing for himself in that day and go to bed crying. May 10th, make it the day. Any CEO that doesnt participate gets their company boycotted for a week.
If the percentage of black billionaires reflected the percentage of black Americans there would be nearly 100, not 7. So yeah not only is 7 suspiciously small it's ridiculously small. Not even a little proportionate.
Cold showers are REALLY nice (in the summer when it's so fucking hot that you feel like you're boiling even when in the shadow)
Holy shit that dog is FLUFFY
9:10 omg i'm fkng crying 😂😂
Love how the alpha breathing dude explained the very simple concept of "in through your nose out through your mouth" in the most American Psycho way possible
Why you lie, Kurtis? 24:19-24:20
I personally like cold showers but I live in a hot climate and run really warm anyway, these billionaires probably live in either temperate places or have warm summer homes so they can do that.
Thank you.
I guess Billionaires don't have to look after their pets. Walking a dog is certainly getting your body moving for more than 2 minute.
Pine apple n pine apple juice n spinach is an ok smoothie...u def put too much avocado fam
The fucking Thomas the Tank Engine bit sent me
taking a cold shower when it's -20 out is illegal
@kurtisconner What tie dye shirt are you wearing in this video? It's rad as hell man.
I've been living your modified billionaire routine for about a month now and I've got to say I've never felt better and I've made billions and crypto and nfts. However my doctor is deeply concerned for my health and I probably do not have long, but I guess that's the cost of hitting the sigma billionaire grindset.
This dude has three whole ass beverages before he even considers breakfast
Very occasionally I have a dream where I feel like it might have some more significant purpose or meaning, but like 99% of my dreams are incomprehensible chaotic nonsense. I don't understand how that would correlate with my psyche trying to clean up its baggage or whatever
“He has overcast in his mouth, dude” really got me 😂😂
I think I speak for everyone when I say, please put your sweet boy Kiwi in every video from now on. Please I love him
Billionaires thinking that they work hard even though they'd probably keel over and die working a regular 9-5 schedule at McDonald's
okay
I hope someone told you chamomile passionflower tea is for bedtime
That's billionaires exist is disgusting.  There is no ethical billionaire.
My eye ball looks like that when i smile😪
If I half-assed half the steps I would have to wake up for work at 5 am. Not counting makeup, skincare, hair, and driving.
When Kurtis said he wanted to put “all the billionaires” in a locker.  Me being concerned about Oprah and Riri. 😂😂😂
4:46 - It's interesting how even though you discredit your dream, you were able to use that dream in this YouTube video as a joke, which is basically your subconscious providing you with additional material to use to make content and live your dream job. 🤯🤯🤯 It works, don't discredit your dreams with expectations, trust that what comes is something you can potentially find use somewhere, even if it is a literal joke. 💖You could even think of it as your subconscious trolling you. Could be like, "I'mma send down the doctor dream where he's talking about eating worms, bet he'll still find a way to use it, lol."  🤣🤣
You wanna be a millionaire Kurtis?, So freaking bad Kurtis?
dang ur alpha breath stinks
He’s absolutely right LMAO I was literally going to say, we shouldn’t judge people by how they look. But I cannot defend Bezos bro LMAO
this routine is like dre drexlers fr 😭
I think your doctor might have yelled at you because you ate 213K worms. That IS too many.
whys the voiceover dude sound like ryan reynolds
Stop eating so many worms Kurtis. That's what that means!
Meditation is like listening to a podcast but not funny 😂😂😂😂
It's a crime that someone managed to take ingredients as independently good as blueberries, avocado, spinach, and water and turn them into one of the worst smoothies in the world.
As somebody who interprets dreams as a hobby, I can actually help with that. It sounds like you’re stressed about sleeping in hotels rather than your own bed, with your girlfriend, in your home. Peeing in dreams can mean a lot of things (usually one of them is that you’ve pissed the bed for real) and the hotel is likely because you go on tours and do comedy shows. That was likely a dream indicating that you needed to take a break from live shows and spend more time at home!
Repeat after  Kurtis: "I'm a murderer", butt with conviction, now!
i would watch an entire video of him roasting the rich
@11:40
Tbh Alpha breathing, when done in private, is kind of good, it expands your ribs, which signals to your brain to relax. Alpha breathing is a good way to practice regulating your breathing when meditating because you take in quite a lot of air at once, as using this technique forces you to intake air from both your mouth and nose.
my morning routine consists of me brushing my teeth, must be why I’m not a billionaire
“Dude he hasn’t taken a breath YET?!” 😂😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😩
so it was you who said it is a sequel of 2021... should've shut up /j
16:00
You know those smoothie ingredients were just examples and not the actual ingredients of one smoothie, right? :D
I hate how when I clap it doesn't echo into nothingness like during his intros
16:01 when he started talking gibberish i lost it
I love how you made the smoothie but chose to blame billionaires for how bad it is 🤣
The smoothie looks disgusting
The tip to cold showers is start off your normal temp and every 30 seconds or so turn it down just a tad. Within 30 seconds your body gets use to the temp and by the end of the shower the cold water wont really feel that cold
Kurtis' "joke routine" sounds like what I imagine billionaires legitimately do every morning after they post their "billionaire routine" tik tok
My morning routine is going back to sleep
So, training your brain to recall your dreams every morning is actually an exercise in improving memory. I don't know what benefits it has beyond that LOL It's true that your brain is consolidating the days events when you sleep, usually that's when something goes from short term memory to long term memory (it's more nuanced than that obviously Lol) but it's not like your brain is just coming up with profound ideas and solving complex life equations out of the blue. Naturally, your brain can only work with what it has.
Ummm... There is definitely a point to the dream recall... I can see it. If you can't see it keep writing your dreams down until you get the picture.
Billionaires are just robots wrapped in skin. "Write a list of things to feel and remind myself I am a human. Because I am 100% a human and not just replicating human emotions having to do these things everyday so I don't override my totally normal real fitting in behavior and expose myself as totally not a robot."
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I feel like I’m watching my sims
I love that the "billionaire morning routine" video didn't account for someone else being in the bed.
It wasn't that bad
ahhhh soo funny
that alpha breathing guy is giving jump scare
.
I love how they say to be successful to be a millionaire do anything but get a job do anything but go to college do anything but something actually productive
not to be a hater but bodyshaming billionaires does nothing except make normal people with those body features feel bad. one of my eyes is bigger than the other and there's literally nothing wrong with that LOL. whats wrong with jeff bezos is that he exploits his workers not how he looks
I thought naming my cat kiwi was original. You bastard
18:49 why does he say spinach like spinidge
18:43 he looks like a sad toddler who lost his red hot wheels car
4:49 the fault in our stars looks so good
13:47 i think there’s a picture on the wall but i genuinely thought it was a person who had broken into ur house and was watching you so i had a mini heart attack
Sad to admit it but I actually tried this routine once and it took up most of the day and it was my day off.  A morning routine shouldn't be that fucking exhausting.
The slowly progressing zoom in to your face as you swallow the smoothie had me rollllllling
The only good billionaire is Oprah
I'd need a nap after all that-- dammit Kurtis beat me to it  So like...I don't...dream? Most nights? Not sure how trying to recall my dreams would help anyway, the last one I remembered was terrible (my deceased grandfather called me on my cell phone and told me "I don't know where I am, Rowan. I'm lost.")
istg if billionaires had the most "perfect" body i would still body shame them cuz fuck em
bruh i think you just made a bad smoothie :/
"his left eye is so much bigger than his right eye. and yes, i am body shaming a billionaire. what, are you gonna stand up for jeff bezos?" no. but i will stand up for myself. my left eye looks bigger than my right eye. it's called ptosis, which (in my case) basically means the muscles in my right eyelid didn't develop correctly, and naturally rest lower on my eye. it's not weird. it just is. there are better, funnier, more interesting jokes to make at bezos' expense, without bringing physical appearance into the equation. bezos will probably never see this vid, or if he does then he won't care. but people like me, who have the physical traits you make fun of, will see this video. now, if i ever meet you in person (god forbid, 'cause i definitely don't want to meet you now), i'll know exactly what you're thinking about my eyes.
Gotta love the algorithm. This is the only time I've seen a diamond commercial before a vid. "Oh, he's watching something about billionaires? Quick, sell him shiny rocks!"
11:55 mustache glitter
Hello everyone! I just want to say that God loves you. Even when you don't acknowledge Him in your life he's always there fighting your battles. As human beings, we were created to love God. We physically cannot live without our creator! Jesus is coming back soon. Put your faith in Him so that we'll all go home to heaven for eternity. God loves you all so much and He sent His ONLY Son to die on a cross for everybody. That was the price of all the sib we still commit on a daily basis. Yes God loves you, don't take His sacrifice for granted. Bye!
is anyone else literally infatuated with kurtises beauty
hahahaha
I come from a Third World Country where traffic is terrible. The working class would spend an average of 2 hours of commute to go to work, and its even worse coming home... It's crazy to me that billionaires can have a morning routine like that! Where I'm from, people wake up at 4 or 5AM, get ready, do a few chores, then rush to work and pray that you get there on time. I don't have time to make tea from scratch or write in my journal or "breathe" LOL! It's a completely different world for us non-rich people.
The smoothie would have been better with a banana and either vanilla or coconut Greek yogurt.
A few thoughts:  1. Jenna should have figured out by now that you do weird things. After all, you get paid to talk to a camera.  2. Wouldn’t it make sense to journal at the END of the day?  3. I actually like 3 of the 4 smoothie ingredients.  4. Most of this has like, New Age health nut vibes.  5. Your alpha breath stinks, bro.
The progressive look of disgust on his face when he drinks that smoothie is visceral.
100-body weighted squats.              50-in place lunges         50-one legged squats each leg
How’s this guy recalling every dream
Do you think when he recorded this he knew he would marry Jenna and go on a theater tour?
These routines are dumb as hell (just like this vid proved)! My routine is basically just, wake up at 6am (yes really), then do whatever till 8am. Half the time I dont even have breakfast! Also, this does actually make me feel awake(ish)
Every time he did the alpha breathing I woke my fiancé up from laughing too hard
1:15 why is suckerburg thicc tho...
How in the HELL do other people seem to dream every night, yet mine are very few and far between?  My nightmares on the other hand...  are TERRIBLE and way too frequent.
Please do more recalling dreams! And maybe some dream theory! Very funny!!
kurtis just to remind you what your fucking sweater says
I had a dream james charles got in a car crash but the car just got really skinny and he started trewking in it wtf does that say
I bet the people that have cold showers buy single packaged bananas
I feel like people who say to take cold showers live in hot climates bc no way they are actually starting their day with cold showers, it lukewarm at best
I loove cold showers though
I just wish I could live like a billionaire for 30 minutes, so I could be economically stable for the rest of my life.
0:31 HE WAS PHOOING RIGHT!
I have scrolled through these comments for multiple minutes and haven't seen anyone mention this, so I'm not sure if I'm the only person that does this, but aren't you kinda supposed to put ice in smoothies?? like is that just not a thing other people do?
Honestly, I wish all billionaires would go the way of MacKenzie Scott and go full-on ancom. She's literally doing her best to get rid of all her money by having a council of minoritized community leaders and charities and such use it for mutual aid
Um, that song is actually from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3, not 2
kurtis can u live like shrek for a week
That is not a morning routine. Nobody does that every single morning. If they do, they're an absolute psychopath.
Peter and I
Damn you are a little late for that one lol but I’m going back in a minute and I’ll send it over right away to the group chat so I don’t forget it when you guys get there so you don’t get a lot done before I go back!
can confirm - after i take my supplements i do my breathing for the day and then get on with other billionaire things
he looked so sad when he took a sip of that smoothie i almost cried
My morning routine alone is 20 min. Who tf has the time to do all of this in the morning
Kurtis' face when drinking that 🧠smoothie is the exact face my toddler little cousin makes when eating anything I've cooked
jim kwik (the narrator of the video) is not a billionaire and that’s not even his video, they just added his voice on top! He is a brain health expert and i am so thankful for his teachings :) this morning routine seems over the top but maybe try adding ONE or two of the things he says, breath work is something so overlooked but SO INSANELY POWERFUL! we don’t just stop and breathe anymore.
Dude you can actually get good at meditation. I got super into it when I was 16 and I had out of body experiences and saw myself sleeping when I was asleep. Imagine a dream where you are just watching yourself in bed. It is the true reason for “dreams” which is sort of like how our kind stays active even while we aren’t awake. That activity is for being aware even when you are at rest. Imagine in the wild sleeping in a bush as lions walk past. I even had another incident when I went camping and coyotes surrounded the tent I woke up to a whomping in my whole body like vibrations emanating from somewhere inside me and I heard the coyotes outside. It was super crazy but when I think about it I think it was my body doing a strange type of self preservation
I have three kids we need to get ready for school before we can leave for work, so indeed, we do not have the time to take our first breath before the first manages to catch the school bus (our little morning miracle). So we are fine for the first step. All goes downward from there, though... ah! Cold if fine too, with the energy crisis in Europe no heating the house this year, so maybe we will manage to get to millionaires, at least?
you were right, this year was worse ❤
Your left eye is also bigger than the right😅 I'm starting to think it's fairly normal, because mine is too
I feel like people like to cosplay poor people with their cold showers
As soon as you did the alpha breathing I couldn’t stop laughing. That genuinely was one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a while
Kurtis, why does your song of India look like that, what happened to the rest of it
This video the “billionaire” made was so far from a min wage reality, I wake up at 6am and need to be at work in 20 mins, I then put my clothes on as fast as possible while my cat attacks me. And I take my anti crazy meds with a monster that I chug and grab another for work, I then run out of the house and open the store. Please try my morning routine.
Kurtis looks like Call Me Mañana from Disco Elysium here
W Kurtis konnor I don't like rich people either
Breathing Kurtis is so cuuuute daamn
You don't just DO a cold shower, I tried it for a while and I would go in with worm water and slowly reduce the temperature and after a while, it gets good, especially in summer.
The alpha breathing makes him look like he's in pain.
bro he breathed befor he drank the water
23:23 well, SOME OF US LIVE IN A HOT F-CKING A-S COUNTRY! You’re not gonna convince me to get in a hot shower when it’s 32°C outside, no matter how much you insist   Btw: ppl many times miss it, I’m not mad, I’m being ironic, just a joke
Beautiful teeth Kurtis, my goodness!
Kurtis you are always funny but you absolutely killed me in this video. 11/10
What rhymes with Bob Saget?
Watching kurtis cry over that smoothie while I eat my jimmy johns is certainly a feeling
These billionaire videos prove perfectly that they did t earn their wealth. They’re literally just filling their time. They have nothing to do while other people rake in billions for them. So they plan “to-feel” lists and make brain smoothies. Like what the fuck. I’d love a brain smoothie, but I need to get to work to help you make more money.
so you're saying eating half a worm is okay?? 👀
to people who hate cold showers: cold water feels good man. go jump in a pool full of steaming water and tell me it was better than a cool pool.
18:20 looks like blood from the first ever period
I hate to ask, what's tony hawk song?
You literally drink like three things already in the morning before eating…
Ye has spoken and now only six billionaires are black.
Nah bruh I’m watching this in a hospital room if I have to stifle down anymore silent laughter I’m going to get a new health condition
“Beta breathing” made me die laughing
KURTIS JUST. PUT MORE WATER IN THE SMOOTHIE OH MY GOD
jeff bezos looks like those anime characters who have like a super twitchy eye whenever they r mad
The fact that I just got an ad for some alpha meditative method while watching this 😂😂 the joke writes itself
"Gonna have to go back to bed after all this shit." A statement so true to hearing this billionaires morning.
15:57
Breathing is for betas.
Honestly, the first thing I do most mornings is try to remember the dreams I had lmao
I think the only reason why someone would have a dream journal is for content or because it helps with having lucid dreams or like a therapist told them to
When he said the tea has lion's mane in it I thought it was quite literal. Don't worry guys, I AM stupid.
I love how it’s a billionaire mornin routine but never does the person talking state he is a billionaire or even who he is I just like to imagine he is making this video and just laughs thinking about people actually doing it
i take it he didnt include the dmt hits he must do every morning to talk like that
24:59
he really did just ask “what’s an artisanal me”  and ran with it
comrade kurtis
Yo I’m in so much pain
It's like they don't wanna do anything a normal person would do, so they always pick something boring and bland to fill the space. Like they are gods and can't stand to do pleb normie shit. And to balance out all the happiness they don't get from a good normal meal they take cocaine.
The key to success:  -Be born white, preferably male  -Be tall -Don't dress like a hobo -be able to talk well  That's already 70% of what a good first impression looks like for a company.   Interviews are great for checking book knowledge and how able you are at talking, the actual skill you have is almost never is tested.  So if you look average or below average, even if you're tidy and well mannered, you've already lost two thirds of what's important in the first impression.  Most high paying positions are filled with tall people, most low paying with shorter people.
How the fuck are you so smooth introducing hello fresh EVERY TIME. That's a flex
14:03 twenty minutes of medication? What are you Charlie Bartlett? Lol I looked up that movie to get his last name right and I found out it was made in 2007!! Boy does time fly
but did you have the calm and security the entire time knowing your grandchildren couldnt spend away all your money away before they died? also quick edit, while i usually agree with you on these types of videos, this "morning routine" with the right framework or lense is practically, drink healthy shit, use cold water (actually warm-to-hot hurts your skin so idk but ye), and do a god-less prayer list, its not the worst advice imo, just cringe they think these lead to success when in reality its how good are you at manipulation flat and simple, good advice to those that are looking for self betterment though i would agree
My cat almost attacked me when I did that breathing thing
i like having a dream journal. but i like my dreams. but otherwise this morning routine is fucking stupid lmao (the parts of the list that arent just common sense, i mean, like drinking water, etc)
seeing your hand writing was very jarring
Thumbs up and an additional comment to beat the algorithm. Thanks for the video! 👍🔥👍
Note than when you breathe out with your tongue behind your front teeth, you make a hissing sound. Thereby proving that to be a billionaire you MUST be a reptile first.
Kurtis our proletariat hero
ima have nightmares from the alpha breathing 💀
4:25 I had a dream I was being chased by ender dragons in warrior cats but warrior cats was a bunch of random humans and backrooms hounds     …
Sorry I barely have time to eat in the morning
Only Oprah actually became a billionaire through hard work
Actually recalling your dreams and interpreting them is very good for your mental health as well as breathing exercises..... but....... but these bilionaires do not take into account how the common, average person struggles everyday. .....
My man burped drinking water😂💀
kurtis just shamelessly and absolutely DUNKING on billionaires is my favorite thing ever
kurtis didn't own any african child slaves or make any significant workers' rights abuses at all in that week. this video was COMPLETELY false advertising!
ah! but dreams do always point to the subconscious. your doctor was mad for too many worms, which could easily be interpreted as  living an unhealthy lifestyle, something you even mentioned at the beginning of the video! too many worms can also literally just be eating too much, or eating the wrong food. personally i have dreams about eating sweets and being unable to control myself because i have vastly reduced my white carb intake and i used to eat sweets all the time without much restraint. i dont ever eat cake, muffins, or anything else that has a lot of added sugar these days. i also have dreams about re-growing my hair back how it was before i shaved it all off, probably because it is something i would hate to have to ever deal with again as someone who completely rejects it now. i trust this comment will 100% be read and responded to. thank you and good day.
He didn’t even brush his teeth??!!
I don't take a COLD shower, I just take a cool? shower, like, a couple degrees lower than room temp, which feels worse than a hot shower, but when I get out of the cool shower, I feel better than when I get out of a hot shower. Maybe it differs from person to person.
*Kurtis' 70s pron star look is BOLD.*
i always take cold showers just cause my calentador is broken idk how to say it in english its not my first language
cold showers do suck, but they are legitimately amazing when you have no AC. It's the only way you can really fully cool down, and I used to take a ton of them back when I lived in a place with no central air. Back then it was pretty much cold shower or sleep with an icepack on your neck and of course I choose the shower option.
i couldnt concentrate bc of your mustache, i want to brush it
The to-be list is actually a pretty interesting idea. Could use some reminders on not being a butthole for the day, especially with those self centered tendencies rising all the time.
Shower temperature really depends on what time of year it is and what the weather is like.  Middle of summer when it's boiling,  I gotta take cold showers or I'll legit pass out.
26:16 proper-ganda
4:53 That sound effect scares me every time I replay it and not expecting it. I was home alone watching this with my AirPods in and it put me in my flight or fight response. I almost had a panic attack 😭
WHAT THE FUCK IS INFLATION?
hahaha this video is fucking hilarious but, i know a better recipe for the smoothie you can use mixed berries, half avocado, oat milk, flax seeds and honey and you can top it off with crunchy oats and almonds with cinnamon and its fucking good, i know its not the point but thought i could share.
The journaling he describes is basically mindfulness journaling, a lot of people do this. Also if you have time to read in the morning, idk, maybe you work evening shift or something but most people don't have this luxury.
I have the same hand writing as you and somehow I can't read my own
alpha breathing hurts my simpy sensitive beta teeth
The part where your were like "we drink water we devour" made me bust out laughing
“this year will be different” yeah. the queen died.
Look, whoever puts water in a smoothie is bonkers. Use milk, milk alternative, juice, coconut water, TEA, *ANYTHING BUT PLAIN WATER YOU HEATHEN BILLONAIRE!* You're literally just diluting the flavors when you put water in there. That's not a billionaire move, that's depression lol.
BTW, it's easier to get a towel all soapy and stuff and wash your body first than it is to wet your body first then soap up if you have to take a cold shower. There's still a shock, but not quite as bad since you're doing it slower... I've had to take a few cold showers/baths o-o And of course, in emergency no-hot-water times, just wash and rinse what's important lol.
The smoothie was just guacamole with blueberries
26:25
i require more kiwi content
Hey I have a question for this billionaire: if he wakes up at 8am every morning, why tf does he have THREE DRINKS. That's so much liquid, dude..... Spend your whole afternoon pissing
i know youre making a joke but meditation is about not thinking about anything at all, like emptying your head and bowels
I just came here to see if someone would tell me what a probiotic is, but I've learnt so much. Not only is this routine very familiar to people who have been in psyc wards, but apparently the guy from the video is just a dude who's into brain heath, not a billionaire. And those two pieces of information tigetg kind of make a ton of sence. Routines and brain excersise would be used to treat mental health patients as well as by a guy who want to improve their brain... Still unsure what probiotic are 🤔
bro in the morning me and my cat have breakfast, i brush my teeth, then i go for a walk and start my day its not that deep
You're my favorite yt to watch when I'm stoned
If the 1930s were rhe great depression the 2000s to 2020s are the big sad
No one else notice how Mark Zuckerberg looks thick as hell?
*skis away*
This video kinda reminds me of the iconic Cody/Noel collab where they made fun of Dre Drexler (now that I wrote this I feel like it's not a real name but hey, Cody and Noel's bit was about him being a super villain). Nice to know I'm not the only one feeling rather stressed and overall weird watching these extra perfect  routines
The billionaire advise: be a wage slave
Hard agree on water first thing, everyone should hit up that glass of water first thing in the morning. 👍🏼 There are some pretty good concepts and practices to adopt for sure, try em out, see what works.
and people fall for this kind of crap............omg.
Hey weird question, does anyone know the exact name of the sound effect he uses for Sell? I've been looking forever and I can never find it. It's in a lot of video games and I'm sure that's probably where he got it from(sounds specifically like Booodborne) but idk if there's a name for it
2:50 how many are jewish?
Imagine having the time and energy to do all that between making his fortune for him
I write down my dreams just so I can have a record of the weird shit my mind comes up with to tell people about, use for story ideas, or most likely tell a therapist about.
The beta breathing made me wheeze so hard, I STOPPED breathing! 10/10 it sure is effective!
4:12 "The first thing I do when I wake up is, I recall my dreams. When you're dreaming is that you're actually processing and intercreating and working on solutions, your subconscious mind to the things that you're focusing on during the daytime" At that point you may as well pedal to the metal and lucid dream but ok I guess
Ok awesome video very funny but I think these guys do this stuff because they want to and it helps them be productive/ makes them feel productive
Does that not sound like Ryan renalds? It’s even more ridiculous when you imagine Ryan renalds
Look at BIG routine over here shilling routine poutine. Pshh. My lifes a mess
Billionaires have way more time than I do in the mornings, I only have an hour each morning to get ready.
oh no you gotta wake up at like 6 lol
not a bad smoothie tbh it's pretty standard in the People Who Comsume Smoothies Universe smoothie is suppose to be 80% blueberries LOL
I’m glad someone else makes Mountain Dew smoothies
COMRADE KURTIS 🙌
I have a squinty eye and a big eye but as a communist, sometimes body shaming sacrifices must be made. Fuck Jeff and reptilian eye balled kin.
The most vivid dream I remember having last is me partnering up with Chucky to destroy the world and then being haunted by Beyoncé but I couldn’t even be scared because it was Beyoncé. I literally went “BEYONCE?!?!” I’m not exaggerating when I say I woke up laughing……
As someone who didn't dream for 15 years (and still barely dreams now even on medication) its impressive that kirtus was able to dream everyday and write them down
Instead of drinking tea just dump the tea in the garbage and drink your coffee and say it’s tea cause what is tea if not coffee for quitters 😂😂😂 well foe people who quit coffee for tea 😂
724 billionaires in America alone yet we still have homeless war vets and people busting their fucking asses to barely scrape by!! Wtf even is this bullshit! 😪
Imma start beta breathing from now on
Billionaires are cringe, lets execute them
16:02
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
I like cold showers
The reason you’re not a billionaire yet is because you didn’t make your bed as soon as you woke up
Spiderman was in your dreams to warn you that theres "no way home"😱😱
i love the breathing technique!!!
Yeah I don’t think my dreams are me solving problems, because last night I had a dream that a little tiny Shrek climbed through my bedroom window, destroyed my bedroom and then gave me a 2 foot long screw shaped present
This was hilarious. Reminds me not to take myself or life too seriously. But these are super helpful tips to some degree. It’s not about getting rich but living a good life.
Dreams are very essential. Even if they are simple. Some are more subconscious than others.
Dude that SHOWER HEAD THO
.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .
Bro I just gotta say I am genuinely impressed by your mullet, only because you pull it off like a Rockstar- happily and with 0 fks given. ☯️🙏🏻
i am Ariadne Sirko, i am a professional dream interpreter, with a PsyD ergo i am a qualified doctor of psychology from Harvard's 1999 courses, i'm also a licensed therapist. In the case of your dreams, the spider-man one means that you are craving more entertainment in your life, you need more distractions from the daily stress you might have. and for the dream where you are peeing on a hotel bed, that means that you are craving excitement but it mainly means that your'e a LITTLE PISS BOY
27:58     a food theory  bon appetit
WHERE ARE ALL THE CARBON EMISSIONS EH KURTIS
Ontario is no longer in lockdown....but its not doing great 🥴
You can body shame a millionaire because they can afford to buy a new one 😂😂
bro kurtis dont dis on cold showers theyre really nice after like a football practice
0:40
i used to take cold showers to try and shock myself out of resetting to worse coping mechanisms (therapist told me to) but it didn’t work and just ended up being a punishment if inflict upon myself when i was sad. they are fucking shit.
How to breath like a serial killer.
Ironically his shirt says be nice
youre thiccer than a bowl of rice krispies
My English teacher showed us the original video, and I almost cringed because I knew I've seen someone breaking it apart before - and also because I hate billionaires, how do you people find them inspirational. Now thar I've FINALLY found the video, I am tempted to send it to her, but I'm afraid of being mean to her  Also damn your alpha break stinks
Kiwi is the fucking cutest little pup 🥺
Listen okay, my room window faces the west. The sun sets in the west, and until it's midnight, my room is a toaster, and making my bed heats up the bed, and made the bed not nice
So this guy just drops 1 billion on a morning routine? Weird flex but ok
"cause i feel like we are a lot of our of who we are is our state and emotions"
John Kwik was the guy. Didn’t know he was a billionaire. But he has some good advice with how to learn.
Is the main aspect to living like a billionaire just being healthy?
Ok so the eating worms thing is your body telling you you’re eating too much of the same thing or of bad things (ig?) or that you’re being baited too much. I love analyzing dreams lol
LOL @ STAY OUTTA THE BASEMENT HUNGRY PLANT DAD!!!!
Wait were those billionaires all American? If so the ratio of black billionaires wasn’t THAT far off from regular stats.  Only 13% of america is black. 62% white. So 13/100 are black. So 7/100 isn’t exactly right statistically but it’s not as bad as it sounds. I’m not sure what the stats would be if it were including the entire world. Though I’d imagine more Saudi oil dudes if that were the case 😂. Just saying I feel a lot of people forget that only one and 10 people is black in America. Like, if you shook up our entire population and then just lined up everybody, on average, six out of every 10 would be white… 1 would be black… 2 or 3 would be Hispanic… and the entire rest would be EVERYONE else (asian, native, and so on). Weird that America is the most diverse country in the world and that’s how it set up? But if you think… Even a country like England is almost 90% white. I think they’re 86%. And then if you take most countries in Africa there are well over 90% black. And same with Asian countries… Most of them are like 96% one race. Like if you go to Japan as a nonJapanese person, especially as a black person, it’s odd to them (not every Asian country tho and ofc most cities are a BIT more diverse, but not like American cities).  People really don’t like to move from their native land. Except Americans. And Canadians. We come from a long line of insane people. And I guess Australia… except they were criminals, moved from England by force 😂.
God I’m so glad I’m not a billionaire so Kurtis won’t make  fun of my wonky lopsided eyes.
The business lion callback was epic  Also shoutout Asher Roth!!
Proof billionaires sleep alone, for how much they simp for women I am shocked!
alpha breathing took so much from me
In the defence of cold showers: - Mr. Billionaire Man probably lives in LA so it's a lot hotter than Canada - I live in Arizona. During the summers cold showers are SO NICE
why is every room in your house a different style. i mean its not bad but like why.
why the fuck is your house so cash money
yo i farted same time as you life is billionaire rn
definitely keep the dancing at 22:53 lmao
@2:34 the truest thing I've heard in a long time
I don't think you put enough water in your brain smoothie
where is my extra greeting?
the sound effects during the alpha breathing section make me feel like i’m suffocating
I resent your misuse of the word few.  ❤️
Jokes on you, I was a Thomas the Tank Engine kid...that theme song already makes me think of every mistake I ever made. Number one: Watching toy train shows.
That smoothie needed WAY more water.
this Mullett gives me so much joy...
i love how igot a taco bell ad
I literally had a dream the other night that I was being waterboarded
I love your videos, but I'll be damned if I could ever tell the difference between high level satire and genuine ignorance
CRINGE .. i die everytime XD
You cannot earn a billion dollars, you have to steal a billion dollars.
This guy looks like Elvis and Markiplier had a son.
That last bit is what I do daily. I don't do the wine thing tho.
“Wow they made a cats movie? I gotta see that” no kurtis. No you should not
MOUNTAIN DEW AND A FISTFUL OF COSMIC BROWNIES KURTIS. WHAT THE FUCK.
Kurtis is slowly morphing into a 70s American White Dad
"your dreams are your brain working on subconscious solutions to problems you have during the day" i would love to know what "being chased through a walgreens full of playground woodchips by a scary woman with a shopping cart while trying to avoid being infested with termites" is a solution to because that's a real dream I had
As a fan of Asher Roth, that sounds like a pretty dope dream.
Fun fact I watched this in my college readiness class, like the billionaire video not this video omg
i think the smoothie needs more water
i actually rly appreciate the mic the original billionaire dude used ! it's amazing and the noise suppression is quite impressive - you almost couldn't hear the sound of him wanking as he spoke
you should make a very really good hype house..like..right now..Kurts
i like cold showers sometimes in  the summer... because i live in a place with a cold winter and i like winter more than summer. its like a weird nostalgia thing.
Ngl I have a similar routine
My morning routine is waking up at 12 am to 2 pm and getting yelled at by my mom for not cleaning my room.
27:25 literally had to pause because I couldn't stop laughing and I felt like I was dying
Cold showers = Best showers
the only thing this morning routine is gonna make you is insufferable 💀
I would love Kurtis to make a video SOLELY of him roasting billionaires/millionaires.
Bro I'm fkn D*ad over here in Wisconsin 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 omg your hilarious 🤣🤣🤣😂
Are you releasing more be nice merch? Just found your channel and LOVE it but saw there’s only a sold out beanie on your site
This video had me laughing so hard I had tears!
I’ll never understand the logic behind smoothies, why turn individually delicious food that you can eat by their own into a disgusting drink? 🥶
Who doesn't...
Kurtis, here is some knowlage for you, cold showers are actually good for you, especially after you workout.
That sweater kurtis was wearing during the re-cap absolutely fucks. Good sweater, Kurt👍👍enjoy it while you can, you know, before I steal it /j
A cold shower every once in a while is just hilarious, I have to throw one in sometimes just to white kunckle the shower curtain and laugh that I'm alive
Honestly that breathing technique thing felt a lot more fulfilling then usual breathing (probably Bc my nose is a clogged toilet 1/10 stars would not use again)
I would just like to point out that kola nut tea has a lot of caffeine in it, and Kurtis took a relaxing tea, which has no caffeine in it. So.... Basically he done Gon goofed up.
the majoras mask reference🤩😎😍
I actually believe your dreams are lingering thoughts of yours. For instance At the beginning you said you diet was shit. Then you said in your dream your doctor was telling you you’re eating to many worms. Sounds like your subconscious is reaching out
OMG wait I have a dog named kiwi and he looks a lot like yours😭
ow- wish i c- i wish i could- i'd ra- uh-yknow?
I fucking love u dude
This video sucks
I honestly think billionaires are bored so they do crazy shit to keep themselves less crazy then they already are
Everyone go listen to I Love Xanax by Asher Roth
Kurtis must have some kind of 10 year deal with Hello Fresh
Dang your alpha breath stinks
I'm going to do 2 or 3 of these steps. I look forward to becoming a thousandaire!
have black people try getting that bag??
16:00
16:01 lmao I quote this a lot
that smoothie looks soooooo gross 🤮🤢
During the "brain training" bit I thought for sure there would be a pivot to Brilliant as a sponsor, but hey, I just watch these things, I don't make them. Thank you, Kurtis, for trying this routine so that I don't have to, and for making it funny. You are part of my 5-figure-aire morning routine.
4:10 ok ok, so dreams arn't like that, my friend literally killed me in a dream last night to become a blood... wtf am I supposed to learn from that?! he knocked on my door, I opened it and he instantly  unloaded a whole ass magnum in my chest like it was nothing, stared blankly at me and said, nonchalantly, sorry bud had tu to be a blood  sorry for the inconvenience, I'll be on my way now
Honestly I do recall my dreams a lot but only because I love writing them down in case they're funny and I end up showing them to my friends, sometimes they give me fun research questions like "do the cookies in cookie run have ages?" also just researching dream symbolism and meaning is just genuinely so fun for me!!!!  since you read all this here's one of the dreams I wrote down titled "Minecrap" "I play Minecraft and there's a lot of enfermen I kill them and there there's just suddenly the ender dragon that I have to fight and then wow suddenly this is a school project and the elementary principal saw it for some reason wow" (for some context my school had 2 principals one for elementary and one for ms+)
It's only 5 months old and I've watch this multiple times
I imagine those billionaires are laughing every time they make one of those videos. It's just charisma, luck, business knowledge with a lot of gray-hat practices that lead to a pile of other millionare's failed businesses after you sucked them dry.
I thought he said the n word ngl
The part where Kurtis was doing the alpha breathing literally had me choking on my food cause I was laughing. Thanks for almost killing me, Kurtis lol
'to feel' or 'to be' is kinda weird BUT writing down things you're grateful for is really good.
16:00 fav kurtis clip
Dang ur alpha breath stinks.
I'm just gonna say real quick, typically when making a smoothie, you cover the smoothie shit with the liquid, as opposed to the 4 millileters Kurtis put in it, hence the mud viscosity.
KURTIS PLEASE BRING BACK THAT SWEATER!! IM WRITING THIS IN JULY 3RD MAN, ILL SPAM YOU 😭😂
Fish, Omg! I am so sorry for saying that word, I understand it may traumatize you
Dang your alpha breath stinks
is no one gonna talk about 16:02
Anyone else know between what morning affirmation we go pee?
It’s even funnier because almost all of the women on the list of richest people are only rich because they divorced a rich old man 🤪
They forgot the two biggest secrets to being a billionaire.   1) inherit it 2) wage theft and other white collar crimes
To feel and to be list. This is the morning routine of a sociopath.
Anyone that’s a young billionaire is either a liar or inherited it. They think all this bullshit is why daddy made them rich.
I want what billionaires have, and by what they have, I mean have enough money to live a life that gives me enough time to do the sort of shit I was taught how to do by my therapist. Mental health suddenly feels like a rich person's privilege
I actually add a splash of cold-ish water at the end of my hot showers for my hair and I’ve come to enjoy the waking-up effect. Makes me feel like a fresh boi
No billionaire would even have time to do this routine 🙂
dude didn’t even put a juice or non dairy milk to make the smoothie, just used water 💀
please make a video of just making fun of rich old white guys
Due to poor life decisions regarding caffeine I can no longer consume very much of it. I do drink tea in the morning but... I'm less happy about it
wow thats crazy, whats the percent of jewish billionaires compared to their population?
"Just saying, if I was a billionaire I'd tell all my potential future competitors that the secret to success is waking up at 6AM."
Incorporating meditation into my daily practice has changed my life in a lot of ways. The increased mindfulness and awareness carries over throughout the day and allows me to make better decisions. It’s wild how much it has influenced my drinking, and that I’m not really drinking anymore. It is that in tandem with a lot of things that’s helped my drinking but, meditation has definitely helped. I think it helps me be more aware of my thoughts and feelings as they come up later in the day so that I can visit then use CBT techniques On whatever comes up. And you do get better at meditation as you work on it. I’m much more comfortable with longer sessions now.
That todo list he made at the end of the video no joke made me die of laughter I am no longer alive
THATS HOW THEY BECOME MILLIONAIRES  ofc bro i am so dumb, they just save money by being healthy and not needing a doctor and then they save money on hot water by using cold water
You’re making your bed after she wakes up? Tsk! That’s millionaire mentality. We’re going billionaire status. Rip the sheets out from underneath her until she does a cartoonesque horizontal spin in mid air and let her fall on the floor with a loud “oof” and watch as little aerial Tweetie Birds circle around her head like the broke person she is. ✨Billionaire style.✨
How many of those 724 billionaires are jewish?
wish i- i wish i cou- id ra- y know?
"ooh i'm a little cuck" is one of the very few things i didn't expect to hear come out of kurtis's mouth 💀
This video has made me feel mad unhealthy lol I had to quit my job because of panic attacks and mental health stuff and besides analyzing my dreams, meditating, deep breathing, and journaling - I don’t really have energy to do anything else. It’s a rough time and not forever but Kurtis is a very funny and different boi then me

The sarcasm & jokes 😂😂😂😂
the dream thing is hilarious. i just know you're not telling me that the dream i had of juggling tomatoes while jumping over a car is me working on solutions to the problems i face in my daily life
Fun fact: learned in my AP class that your dreams actually is your mind attempting to solve problems in your everyday life.
Kurtis: *gets mad at billionaire for adding a sponsor in their morning routine list* Also Kurtis: *puts a sponsor from HelloFresh in his morning routine list*
I want to know all of your dreams they are so good
Tbh I feel impressed at how many dreams this mf has. I don't know if I'm the only one who dreams, like, twice a month or so, but damn ma man.     I'm aware that the "dream interpreter" part was possibly a joke, but I like to think I'm good at interpreting them. So the Spiderman dream could've been an expression of how you feel like your short term wants may interrupt your long term needs. The worm dream might be a worry that something you love doing (probably drinking coffee) is bad for your health, so your subconscious created a doctor to tell you "yo, bitch, get your shit together".   Thank you for your attention.
It was a morning Putin  (Like the Canadian chip and gravy I’m so funny)
tip to make cold showers more bearable, start with the temperature u normally shower in then slowly make it colder. I honestly enjoy cold showers they're refreshing and just generally feel good.
would it negate the positive effects of the brain smoothie if I add vanilla ice cream to it? would be pretty good, ngl.  you know, i think these brain smoothies are working, I just had a billion dollar idea: add ice cream to literally anything and money money money also, diabetes
If you were to make 10k a day and not spend a single cent on anything ever it would take you about 275 years to make 1 billion dollars so you would have to live almost 4 lifetimes to make 1 billion from 10 k a day and people still think it's fair that people have billions
The I'm a cuck comment took me out. Fucks sake
Kurtis: *makes fun of guy for putting an ad at the end of his video* Also Kurtis: “this video is sponsored by Hello Fresh”
I have heard that some people take cold showers because it forces them to take shorter showers. Think about it. If you take a cold shower, you want to hurry up and be done with that shower ASAP! Also, after you get out of a cold shower, the air around you feels much warmer and relaxing. Idk if I agree with the second part, but that’s what some people have mentioned.
Honestly. The actual funniest part of this video is when you started blending the stuff and it just looked like vomit and i tried so hard not to laugh
so, a lot of this stuff isnt nothing. like, the dream thing; he's actually right about dreams being your brain's way of processing what happened that day, theyre not just totally random brain mush. (like, your worm doctor dream - that day you probably at one point thought about getting yelled at by a doctor, and then later you saw a worm.) that doesnt mean they can necessarily tell the future or fix your problems, but recalling dreams honestly does sound like a good way to figure out what's going on in your head. daily breathing exercises are actually really good for you, too. you dont have to do all the esoteric techniques hes talking about, just focusing on deep breathing for a few minutes a day is shown to help a lot. im not really sure why he separates meditation and deep breathing, though. theyre pretty much the same thing oh and those lists sound exactly like the kind of thing they would have us do in group therapy. tbh all hes doing is basic mindfulness, which is actually really helpful in improving mental health and becoming aware of your physical health.  so yeah, like, hes mostly doing things that are good for you, but making them esoteric and elitist, like rich people do. but youre totally right about how these things dont make you a billionaire, theyre just things billionaires have the luxury to do because they have all the time and money in the world. theyre things that are good for you, and are worth doing if you have the time, but theyre not gonna turn anyone into a billionaire
I fiancee has done basically all of these things as a morning routine for about two years and he still stuggles with his part of rent... Just saying... He wants to be rich, has his own company and cold showers are his jam. But Alas, the money isn't coming from meditation.
Can't relate, I tend to read for like 6 hours a day
Yeah American billionaires and millionaires are really selfish, my science teacher had a millionaire uncle who lives in the states, I’m pretty sure he was close to being a billionaire because he owned a university and when he let his own nephew drown in student debt. Pay check to pay check, didn’t give him a dime when other average wealth family members gave him what they could
This is the most "born already rich" shit I've ever heard.
Why is nobody talking about how that guy with “alpha breathing” looked like he had a gun pointed at him. OH. Dude looked so fucking scared like he was gonna get shot if he stopped alpha breathing for a second
You’re a skinny boi, your milkshake needed milk(almond milk) and peanut butter!   The billionaire sounds like he had a great set up for himself, but every person is unique— his items seemed like all ways to reconnect with himself, stress relief, and waking up all cognitively.   Not everyone may need to reconnect with themself as much as he does, but I love you tried it and found what works for you to optimize yourself :).

You can’t fool me with the Fable background music Kurtis. I feel your nostalgia hooks.
Steps 1 - 9 act like your better than everyone else, then forget to mention step 10: inherit daddy's fortune. Got it.
6:27 when the creepy, eerie ringing sound played it made me think it was my oven.
9:46
The self-aware face during the transition from video to ad was so good.
Yeah working in fast food is very different, but like in office work or academia, or even as a youtuber, you can reasonable tackle 3 big and important tasks. Of course you gonna have to do smaller tasks too, but too often less important tasks and interruptions take up all the work day.
cold showers are nice when its 80 degrees outside and you're all sweaty from physical activity but kurtis lives in canada and doesnt seem to work out so his feelings are understandable
I love cold showers because of how you feel after
Most billionaire routine shit is dumb, but if you start your shower warm and do all your cleaning, then move it down to as cold as possible in steps I find it really wakes me up and feels good
IDK if its just cause I have a terrible gag reflex, but when I tried to alpha breath with you I almost throw up, something about the tongue placement really upset my stomach.

yee yeee
27:15 the reason you cant feel your legs is because of the diabetus
also. unbelievably based kurtis conner
even without your editing throughout the rest of the video the beginning is still accurate as to how absolutely batshit this whole "alpha sigma billionaire grindset trillionaire mindset" thing is
shaming people for shit they can't control is never okay  _however_  bezos has MORE than enough money to fix his weird eye thing a thousand times over. as in, he absolutely is capable of changing it. also, yeah, billionaires only got to where they are from ludicrous amounts of help from mommy and daddy, along with, oh yeah thats right, threatening people with homelessness and starvation for not doing what they say. very not chill, mr boss baby bezos
i dream i  was being smart then i got upset i woke up then slept again to try to get the same dream again
Your teeth are very white
i had a dream walter white drove me away from a nuclear explosion
the "thnking about drive, thinking about power, we drink water,  we devour" part was way too fuckin funny to me.
those dudes who sit in tubs of ice water are right about deep breathing, the warm water usually runs out before im done washing my hair and taking deep breaths and just focusing on the task at hand makes it pretty tolerable still not very enjoyable, wouldnt do it by choice but its helpful to have in the back of your mind at least
My favorite Kurtis video, here we go again
I recalled one dream like, last week and it was just because it was actually really cool but other than that it has done nothing for me ever. 2/10
28:24 AUUUUUUUUUUGH
when you said billionaires have time to fart around when you literally farted during the meditation was so accidentally funny love that
22:19 PLEASE REVIEW THE CATS MOVIE
I’m only 10 minutes in but it seems like what I need to do to become a billionaire is to quit my job and spend a lot of money 🤔
My personal take on hello fresh that literally every YouTuber is sponsored by:  Fun? Not really. It's cooking. It will feel like cooking. If you find that fun, it will be fun. If you don't, it won't. Easy? Sure 👍 Affordable? Eh. Nah  But the real benefit is LEARNING how to cook, or being introduced to many new dishes and combinations of ingredients! For someone not super familiar with cooking, Hello Fresh is perhaps THE best way to be introduced to it. But I don't think it should last forever, because no, I don't think it's very affordable.
Took me 4 months to watch this video and right when I started it I dropped my phone on my flat tits. Good start
If you have panic attacks you should try the cold shower, it stops mine within 2-3min every time. Or if you don’t have time for the shower you can hold some ice cubes.
he should've done dr kawashima's brain training on ds
cold morning showers are for fuckers who live in florida
The breathing is actually really good for your cardiovascular health, like a lot of it seems somewhat normalish and p healthy just like has nothing to do with being a billionaire. Edit: I hadn’t seen the “to feel” and “to be” lists those are fuckin wack
The key to being a billionaire: never take a shit or brush your teeth in the morning again.
I think I laughed more at this video than any other video kurtis has made.
Bruh only did it once you know it
These people are not actual human beings.
let’s force kurtis to make a video just roasting the shit out of billionaires people
Can you make a video just making fun of old white billionaires?
You sound very uninterested when advertising hello fresh. Do you even like hello fresh Kurtis Conner? Removing my sub this instant.
"Dang ur alpha breath stinks"😂🤣 Rlly dawg💀
kurtis why didnt you just put more water into the smoothie im DED lol
I don't really buy into that morning routine thing, it just sounds like random bullshit to satiate us peasants
No one   Light Yagami: 9:11
watching this video for like, the fifth time now and only now realized that the morning routine list included making bed, taking your first breath, taking a cold shower and whatnot BUT NOT A SINGLE putting your clothes on?? 🤔 kinda sus if you ask me... 🤨 like you're gonna go through all these 15 steps completely naked or in your pyjamas?? 🤔🤨 kinda sussy my dude.... 👁️👄👁️
How I make my millions:  1. Wake up and meditate to a soundscape of whales mating  2. Drink rhino tusk powder in a vat of yerba mate   3. Mentally prepare myself to exist through a series of meticulous blinking exercises  4. Stroll around a pond of koi fish while cataloguing my every emotion into a journal made from the hide of a Siberian yak  5. Inherent millions from my father
kurtis how dare you make fun of jeff. i have direct contact with him and im telling him that you said these things. this is the most unacceptable behavior ive ever seen, i might have to bleach my ears!!
As a chronically ill person I cannot pull off that morning routine without weed.
This is a masterpiece. Keep coming back for jeff bezos' eye inflation
I do think that claiming that hard work is what they did to make that money isn't exactly true, because from what i can tell you need to invent a product first. These guys do have to work hard in a sense. Actually I would guess that what they did was similar to what Curtis does if he were to film, edit, and release a video every other day by himself in the beginning. All of that hinges on inventing something that is hugely beneficial for society, or completely changes the world. So really hard work isn't the answer to get a billion. Being an early adopter of systems and creating ways to manipulate that system, or involve it in as many lives as possible is. However I guarantee the vast majority of these guys barely sleep because they have so much to do after they make that billion. You don't have to step on the working class though?? Why do you think that? Musks employs all make really good money, get stock in whatever company and just a higher chance to get their ideas utilized and rewarded. His first thing that made him rich was paypal, I cant imagine it required anyone to get stepped on. Bezos obviously steps on the working class, but its not necessary.
4:40 your dream means you’re too scared of death and you think about it so much you kinda feel like it’s unhealthy and the stress from all that overthinking is what might shorten your life <3  12:25 you feel like you’re stuck in routine and doing the same things over and over so you have a need to get out of your comfort zone (hotel instead of home) and do something extraordinary that no one is expecting you to do
Imagine trying to do all this when you have an office job with a 45 minute commute and/or kids that you have to feed and take to school every day...
It’s been four months where’s The Roast of The Rich
15:15 Cold showers are super relaxing. For me initially before I started cold showers I would stay like 30mins to an hour every time I take a bath, I would take so long because I would get lost in my thoughts. It got to the point where I would tell my family "hey, I'll help you out with that thing after I take this short shower" and they would reply "nevermind, I need help now not in an hour" and just like when the MacDonald's clerk started to recognize and give me "the usual" I knew it was time for change.  So I started doing cold showers, immediately I could see the benefits instead of taking like an hour I would finish in 3 mins because "f*ck this, god it's painful". A problem started to arise though, I would dread taking a bath instead of taking a bath for 30mins I would spend about 30mins in the bath trying to psyche myself up to enter the bath.  So I started to modify the cold shower a bit. I would have warm water at the start and then when I am already in the shower I would drop the temp and end it with a cold rinse. Suddenly it was starting to click and my body was able to adjust to the cold and gradually improve.  I think to get the best benefit out of cold showers you need to truly understand them, cold showers wake up the body and relax muscles. A cold shower after an intensive exercise is bliss. People also need to stop villainizing hot showers, hot showers make the body sleepy and similarly relax muscles they're best before bed. You can also mix and match showers within one bath, 1 minute very hot, 1 minute very cold there's alot of variations.  Most importantly cold showers finally allowed my lizard body to adjust to the cold. My country's temperature casually goes to 70C (160F for the freedom warriors) so I was fully adjusted to the hot temperature, but when the temperature drops to 5C (40F) I would act like a lil-bitch. Now cold showers have allowed me to evolve to be able to resist scalding heat and freezing cold, I am invincible now
14:22 Mediation is a skill that you practice, I used to get bored in the 3 min mark then after a while I was able to meditate for 10 minutes. Then I got lazy and stopped meditating and now I reach 6-7 minutes. Honestly meditating is really helpful, you don't have to do like 20-30mins even 5mins to calm down your nerves, reset your focus and allow you to re-prioritize your goals is very useful. Especially for a person with ADHD
this video is hilarious kurtis is so funny PLS
I dreamt about chasing a Paralympic runner whilst there where dinosaurs swimming in the pink sky. I’d really like to know what the fuck kinda problem my brain was tryna fix there
the most baffling thing about this routine is that yeah they're all nice sentiment, but also no one with a 9-5 job who's actively in the working class has the time to do any of it. as Kurtis said, this just proves billionaires have time to goof off in the morning.    also, it was kinda funny to see Kurtis expose his caffeine addiction to us with the tea thing, lol.
10:24 ksi?
Smoothie made solely of Mountain Dew and cosmic brownies and then playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that got me keep it up kurtis…also what the fk did I miss and where is my extra greeting???? Ffs
This year is even worse
He has dreams every night? He’s closer to being a billionaire than we are ig
Plot twist: he did this expecting it to work and when he didn’t grind hard enough he made this video to pick on the poor billionsaires (they’re just like you and me- but with success)
It's very obvious that this routine is NOT for people who work for a living. Being completely detached from the reality of regular people is such a quintessential part of being a billionaire.
Cap.
Y’all I’m so upset rn I didn’t get my extra greeting 😭
Also start your shower hot and then go cold at the end chest the system
Why is your Christmas tree up LMFAO
Nice diarrhea brain smoothie
Could anyone else understand exactly what he was saying when he was stuttering after taking a sip of the hot coffee?
As a dream interpreter it means you want to piss on the bed in a hotel
coming back to rewatch this and i got tired just listening to the whole morning routine 😭😭
Am i the only one who takes cold showers and likes them?
Kurtis the beta breathing had me DEAD
187k worms please
excuse me kurtis WHERE IS MY SPECIAL EXTRA GREETING
Spinaj
the pain and sadness on his face when he drank that smoothie....poor Kurtis 😂
Never use the dream piss bed
I like how reading is part of his morning routine. If I start my day reading, I'm not doing anything else that day.
My man looks like theres feces coming from his nose lmaoo
My man's mustache looks like shit lmao 😂
Deadass, some of this is really good advice but it’s extremely hard to believe because of the people preaching it
ayyyyy my smoothie is almost what billionaires drink! I do peanut butter instead of avocado tho...
Did this dude seriously say „Gunko“ instead of „Ginko“ 💀
Dear Kurtis,   Please consider using your billionaire funds to fooling the FBI. Your ability to change your appearance within only 4 years is incredible.   Keep grindin' (that skateboard),  - BigDAfterDark
Why does the voice over for the billionaire morning routine sound like Doug Guller from the undercover boss video?
So no one is gonna mention the tea ingredients that they mentioned in the video 😭😭
oh if hi woud have known
Ya. I don’t have three hours to spare every morning.  I will remain a Thousand-aire.
18:32 *contemplating life choices*
i used to take cold showers, it wakes me up cause of shock, doesn't make me stay in the shower for a long time and i feel more fresh after so idk do what u want with that
The intro of this video did NOT age well... 😀😀
"Focus on the dreams you just had"   *me who literally woke up an hour ago from a nightmare that my mom was gonna inject a fluid in me that would kill me instantly and I gotta find a way to avoid that*   Me: uhuh.... okay.. id rather not?
I love how your videos become more and more dank 😭
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The sequel of 2020???? Hope it’s the dragons franchise cause if so I’m bout to have a good year 😇
I take cold bathhs..
kurtis ate that jerk UPPPP
6:26 this guy's onto something i breathed along (like an alpha) and this was the first time i've burst out laughing in ages
Kurt is, you're such an entp
The only thing I took away from this video is that Kurtis has really nice teeth
4:17 So the thing about that is...I had a dream where i was bee and my whole family were dogs trying to kill me, but then we became friends, and then i started to lay eggs...I was 9....WHAT THE FU- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN????????
So when do you plan on buying Twitter
This guy doesn’t brush his teeth
I literally just got a amazon ad-
Only reason for a cold shower: You feel overheated and don’t want more heat
You're a fucking champion. This is the first of your videos I couldn't get through because the cringe that billionaire douchebag was spewing was just too potent.
you are not your feelings and emotions!!! that is not what defines you!! i hate that mentality :(
12:14  I thought that meant he like saw spider-man like literally saw spider-man doing web stuff
I just hit my '100,000 words' goal with writing the second book in my series (titled "Diamond Dragons").  I'm pretty certain less than 10% of those reading this have ever done that, and also that 0% of everybody, everywhere give two $#1t$ about that. 😂🤣😂  🐲✨🐲✨🐲✨
Watching again after Elon bought twitter.
One time I was in the psych ward and their hot water broke for a few days so I had to take cold showers. I would let the water hit me turn it off and the jump out to do what I needed to do like washing my body, face, and hair lol. And when I rinsed out my hair i would stand outside of the shower
Hey look, you had in your video maybe 6 of those rare black billionaires  Time to catch up, black people! Me and my fellow whiteys are already halfway there! Get fuckd blackoes!
similar routine in mental hospital (forced) but structure like this can help some (neuro divergent) people or people in crisis - helps me to this day so i dont think its terrible advice for everyone<3

Hi mayor pls drop another green screen video but with your dreams
i own that same knife 18:07
Think 2022 being the "sequel to 2020" sums up my pandemic experience.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
You should have swum in a giant coin vault
11:50 is vastly underrated.
Bro you built like billy from stranger things
Today, I feel nothing.
"i recall my dreams" man freud would love this guy
Kurtis Comrad
Not me sitting here, a person who enjoys cool showers 👀
For the shower take your normal heat water shower but at the end of it for 30 sec or 1m shut that heat off ...  as you are waking up the cold water keep youre body in the awakening process, while hot water relax it, so its really not bad but really no need to take tho whole shower with cold water ... it clean less anyway
The alpha breathing seems like a version of lion breath (I think it's translated as that) in yoga. It's actually really useful during difficult poses since it takes the focus off your screaming muscles
Heres the hot take on cold showers- 😂
The guy in the “Alpha Breathing” tutorial reminds me of Norman Osborn
22:26 just watch the musical it's so much better
Empathy journals are significant kurtis. It's a strategy suggested by many therapists for people who have issues acknowledging their own emotional reality. "The Average Joe" should take an inventory of their daily feelings in some form, when possible, to avoid repression and encourage self-transparency. My partner and I do daily affirmations where we verbally "journal" what we appreciated about our days and what we are grateful for in each other and our lives.
I mean ironically the Thomas the train one happens in my house with my kids then quickly follows me questioning all of my life choices 🙃 😅
Telling communist's arguments about exploitative capitalists livin in beautiful rich  capitalist country... Ok, lefty...
I love that the morning routine also has you guzzling down 3 different drinks with no solid food to be had, because billionaires get enough nutrients from all that alpha breathing
know how you specified, "Ontario, where I live," so we knew you weren't just really upset about the state of some random Canadian city
20:55 It's not! It's the most helpful for artblock peeps, sometimes my dreams have the sickest plot and decent complicated characters, i need to draw them as soon as i wake up😡😡😡 take that bacc
hey kurtis i just wanted 2 say taking a cold shower actually has many benefits. i learned in therapy that it can really help with emotional regulatio and it also is good for your skin
I would watch a video that was just you recreating weird dreams you have
Ssooooo why not body shame any of the female billionaires? Or is that somehow different?
I accidentally binged your New Year's videos from the past 3 years and that was a really unsettling thing that the algorithm did
trying to remember your dreams is the way to develop lucid dreaming, I have no idea what it has to do with money
dang ur alpha breath stinks
kurtis’ “real” billionaire routine was the funniest shit i’ve heard in a while 😂😂
that’s my bday on the notes app🥹
I like that your breaking point was your own hypothetical coffee restriction.
If that guy’s forehead is even half the size of his ego, that brain juice is working
I’m shocked Kurtis didn’t comment on the Lion’s Mane in the tea— I mean, my first assumption was obviously that it was real lion hair, but when I looked it up, I learned that that shit’s a mushroom comparable to the taste of lobster. Vegan lobster tea. Every morning.
110% for body shaming billionaires
Maybe you should have your iron checked by your doctor, your body might be telling you it's vitamin deficient. Our subconscious process during sleep is a mystery but it does do something beneficial for us for sure. The human body is such an awesome and crazy thing, like an organic computer with no user manual :) I once heard that kids will eat worms when they are low in iron, maybe the whole eating worms and then seeing your doctor combo, was your body knowing it was low on iron and creating a scenario where you could address it? Our bodies seek homeostasis and when the body is out of balance, we hurt and it tries to tell us how to rebalance. Just a thought, could be totally off base. Just bored and watching youtube videos when I should be writing my paper....lol
I want my extra greetings 😂😂😂
Kurtis has a nice ass shower
this billionaire man sounded so much like ryan reynolds i was waiting for him to show up and say HAH just fucking kidding
Video making fun of rich old guys please
that’s wild another lock down i live in arizona we haven’t worn masks here in like a year lol let alone lock anything down
The only person who can say "We're not human doings, we're human beings" and not sound cringe is the Scatman
ok in jeff’s defense, (even tho i hate him) he could have potentially had a stroke which could make one side of his face sagged which would make one eye appear smaller/skinnier.
I can confirm this routine is bs because I love puzzle games and I play sudoku almost everyday in a book I keep in my school bag and I am not rich yet
There's a film about the Civil War in Russia where a horse is pulling a car. Because cool guys drive cars. They don't always have gasoline, though. That's where the horse comes in.
Plot Twist: the doctor in Kurtis’s dream was talking about gummy worms and not bugs
my favorite thing about this is that the rich dude sounds like he's making this up entirely on the spot. "the next things I do is .... uh...um...i make... a brain smoothie?"
why did he keep the tea packet in
the ending routine was comedic genius kurtis
i have a feeling that kurtis didn’t like the cold showers 🤔🤔
Based
Your shower looks fucking awesome.
dang bro, ur alpha breath really stinks btw, how dare you use that clip of amos after cedric's death; yes, i have still not been able to recover from it.
you’re so right about the white man only billionaires crap 😭
I love Danny and drew but Kurtis is aggressively relatable lmao
"Today you feel nothing!"
It is indeed a worse year.
WHEN CKY PLAYED😍😍😍😍😍😍
I’ve been stuck in your videos all day and find myself busting out laughing at ur editing and I know u props won’t see this but thx💪😎
“Take your first breath” I’m ROFL
Most people: Spinach Kurtis: Spinidge
Kurtis’ routine 😂😂😂😂😂
Kiwi stretching was the cutest thing ever
Not to be that person, but recalling your dreams is a good exercise for your brain, it helps you with memory and makes you think fast
Knew a fairly rich entrepreneur who had a morning routine like this. One of his quotes is: "Hobbies are for women and children, I work for a living, that's why I have <Nice Car Here> and you don't."
A person without kids  Those smoothies are disgusting
So I am currently binging your content(all of it). Now when you used the “that’s my boy” clip I did laugh out loud but that’s what I said when my euthanized dog was dead in my hands soo… I might be fucked in the head. I need to see a psychiatrist.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
I will say in defense of to feel and to be lists, is that they honestly just sound like daily affirmations and I don't really see anything wrong with that since it can help some ppl out. Putting them under a name like a to do list tho is kinda weird
Weed stops me from having dreams I guess I'll never be a billionaire
Kurtis that smoothie could have been good. It just needed more WATER
I know it's so easy to clown on but "I'm a human being, not a human doing" is literally advice my therapist has given me. The way I use it is to remind myself that I deserve empathy and love even if I don't "do anything" and I just am. It's been a good reminder for me personally, as someone with depression. But I feel like it comes out a lot more pretentious when it's sold by these faux intellectual billionaires
i started diong crosswords in the morning because i used to do them with my dad as a kid. It surprised me as a pleasant thing to start the day
“Okay reading, I can do that. I know how to do that.”   We believe you Kurtis don’t worry
why was brush teeth not on the routine
180k worms!
plonk
Don’t get me wrong a lot of this is stupid. It’s advice that comes from ignorant people. But some things on here have merit like breathing and meditation have like proven benefits. (Plus cold showers are pretty nice)
WHERES THE EXTRA GREETING HUH?
when you poured the smoothie i started CRYING
dang ur alpha breath stinks
20
2:00
billionaire morning routine includes zero hygiene
Bro is this a joke….I feel like I’m watching Kody‘s video. Unsubscribe. Sad.
Kurtis I love your handwriting, my 10 year old nephew writes similarly 🥰
Damn now I want a cosmic brownie.
lolol
kurtis i think bodyshaming is harmful no matter who it's directed to because other people watching who share the features that are being shamed are also inadvertently getting body shamed
i hate that he puts water in the smoothie  like bro what are you doing; use milk or orange juice or ANYTHING but fucking water
i would take a cold shower everyday if it meant i could use that shower! god that rainfall or waterfall shower head whatever it’s called looks so nice, ive only used them a couple times before at people’s houses and they weren’t even as nice as that one
When your morning ends at 10 pm
F8ck I like Kurtis but sometimes he plays the "Everything is racist" Card and ive heard him say that  "There's a women's pay gap" When it's been proven false several times its just so bullshlt to see a content creator playing the common shw cards just to save their own hides and come across as acceptable like they believe they have too
my dream was that the rock was playing santa in an animated christmas movie about a young progressive santa who wasn’t an old racist white man because apparently that was an issue in the santa community
This whole video just seems like Kurtis making fun of things that are legitimate and proven and like 2 weird things.
Kurtis sounds like he's subbed to r/antiwork and actually takes it seriously  Grow the fuck up my guy
that shower is so NICE
2:00 to 2:30 🤣🤣🤣 Im dying
basically add "brain" in front of any object or activity and that makes you feel like you are doing something important apparently.
You included 96 quite bitter beings 😂 what a throwback haha
who is the billionaire talking here?
jeff bezos tries to look like dr. evil.
20 Minute Meditation is waaaay too much when you’re a beginner maybe start with 3 and then 5 minutes and then 10 and so on🥰
mark zucker? hardly know 'er
bro why have I never seen kiwi he’s so fckn cute
I think the point of the to-feel and to-be list could be to be mindful of how you're feeling and you're emotional priorities. If you're making a to-be list and realize "i haven't been a very good listener recently, I'm going to be mindful of that going forward today." I don't think any billionaire actually has that much thought in personal relationship or emotions, but I do think it might be useful to some people.
Alpha breathing is terrifying... looks like Arkham breathing.
The *actual* billionaire routine sounds like the soul crushing humanity destroying routine that can actually make you into a billionaire
Omg, u couldn't find the shit the billionaire was talking about 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bro lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well 2022 has been even worse than 2021 so far…
Dawg put more water in the smoothie, it’s supposed to be a smoothie not a lumpy💀
This is still a great video and I understand that it's supposed to be funny but he is completely missing the point of all of these things
you literally have me crying laughing.  thankssssss
4:20 my response is mouth neck (a dream that terrified me when I was younger)
Making fun of rich old guys video w h e n
i tried the alpha breathing thing and now i dont feel real
10-15 mins is a much more realistic meditation for most, but even a 5 minute one works if that’s all you have the time for. It depends on what you want out of the practice and if you’re someone that can sit still with less to focus on for longer amounts of time.
doing pranayama, meditation and Tummo/Wim Hof breathing is great for you (alpha breathing cringe BS, use your NOSE damn it, mouth breathing is terrible), it won't make you a billionaire but like... proven benefits with actual scientific literature on it... anyways yeah those lies are just to make the working class complacent with income inequality. Cold showers and Sauna are also fantastic for you, amazing benefits but hot shower first you have to get clean ffs, end with 1-3 minute cold shower feels good man, the initial shock sucks but yeah...
wow
16:03 😂
No more than ten worms 🪱
I love your ‘Jerry curls’ Kurtis so 1980s
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
i have rewatched this video so much,,, it’s a good video to laugh at when you’re crying 👍
The human doing line is a Scatman lyric (and executed way better there than by this guy)
I don't believe for a second that this is someone's real morning routine. It seems totally unsustainable and made up lol
CHAMOMILE PASSIONFLOWER YOGI TEA??? They never have that where I live
Our dreams are our subconscious solving our problems we had the previous day? Last night I had a dream that I was in my pajamas at school and my head teacher was Monica Geller. She locked us in the school and I escaped my running about the building going into a warehouse (?) which lead to the town. The genie from Aladdin gave me a clown Halloween costume which I put on to get Monica to fall in love with me. The dream cut of right before we kissed... What life problem will that help me solve?
I think it's the fact that it's correlated directly to billionaires that really makes it ridiculous. Being a billionaire isn't a good thing. It's a tragedy.
warren buffet eats mcdonalds, im basically a billionare
No matter how many times I watch this I still lose my shit over Kurtis's parody routine at the end.
" You're allowed to body shame a billionaire " needs to be on a t-shirt
I had to pause your videos just to vape because I was too scared you were gonna make me laugh for the millionth time and I was jus gonna choke and die
There are very few things that make me laugh out loud, let alone laugh during the whole video. Well done, well done. 😂
What’s the song at 27:22
Kurtis never really sits and breathes. Okay 👍
Kurtis’s hair actually really nice 👍
Everyone in the comments: Posting about the actual content  Me: scouring the comments to see if anyone caught the Goosebumps Stay out of the Basement clip at 27:16
The science of this guy’s smoothie making process is just like me at 6 years old when I would put flowers and shit in my dog’s food so that my dog would smell nice
H 🏃
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I had a dream the other night and it was Elsa getting out of a taxi pregnant then she was being yoga and embarrassing her kid and I was her kid
morning routine:  wake up - chug pre workout - hit gym - eat breakfast - go to work  done. i love my life.
9:11 First thing on your “To Feel List” is horny, lol? Dude....🤦‍♂️   Pre edit:   🤣
Damn he spent a whole week writing a To do list and he didn't put "Improving my handwriting" like Jeesus a handless kid would write better than that
why do i have the same handwriting as Kurtis
when i saw the alpha breath thing just happened THAT thing,, like know when you realize you are breathing and you automatically stop breathing normally until you forget that? then.
It was a beautiful day, when I decided to type "episode" on youtube. And then I clicked on your video. Now I can't stop watching your videos :D
Just watching your videos and holy fuck are you funny lmfaoooo
this dude just does nothing all morning, this is a routine of a privileged guy who has everything lol why does he pretend to be all focused, just sit at home all morning and play video games
Kurtis’ alpha breathing is sending me💀
Man you're funny
Man thinks he's a character in demon slayer wtf is Alfa breathing
15:03
Why has a brown and black furry caterpillar been shitting on your upper lip for 2 years?
i tried alpha breathing with you while watching, and made it halfway through the 8 second hold and then laughed because it felt dumb. and your funny
spinidge.
I can't imagine how many dislikes this video has lol
omg just followed kurtis’ morning routine i’m feeling goodddd
never got cold showers. shower warm and then rinse cold. closes your pores and gives you a jolt without being miserable for an entire 10min
gODDAMN I'M SO JEALOUS OF KURTIS' SHOWER  that sounds weird, I mean like, I want your shower, the fact it is on the ceiling is fuckin' cool as b a l l s and I wan' it
“This years gonna be different” The current year: 💥🔥☄️
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
Test
I had a dream the other night where I was being chased by a giant, 60 meter tall Kanye West
"this year's gonna be different" oh god
RIGHT ON KURTIS sleeping in the same bed with your girlfriend MY MAN
Nice
that smoothie activated my gag reflex just by looking at it
a main reason for recalling your dreams is if you have nightmares from trauma so you can talk about it and work through it. but dont do it all the time, only if you have to work specifically on nightmares cause it is not nice to recall them at least for me.
19:22 his hair looks so pretty! and also my hair type and color is almost exactly like his so i feel like a cool kid.
Hello Fresh come to brazillllll
I’m case anyone needs the list:  - wake up and pour red wine on your sheets - eat a sleeve of saltines - beta breathing  - thomas the tank engine theme song at full blast on the tv - think about every mistake - blazing hot fire with your journal - leave your to feel list blank - make a Mountain Dew and cosmic brownie smoothie - guzzle it - play tony hawks pro skater two until you pass out from exhaustion or a heart attack ❤️You’re welcome❤️
9:56 “if I have time, I will make time” huh
honestly, dreams can definitely be the mind working through stuff, especially if you have PTSD or other mental illnesses. It won't make you rich though, just tired all the time lol
Damn I wish I could just plan away my depression. Would make it alot easier
He reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite’s brother Kip
The second I saw this title the only thing I could think about is adding "on a budget" to the end of said title
As someone with no survival instincts and crushing depression/anxiety, having any kind of routine or self care things I do every day helps manage the existential terror. But I struggle to keep up with it. Having some things you try and make yourself feel better throughout the day and in the long run is cool, but fuck cold showers man.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
bro you needed to add banana to the smoothie lol...
kurtis saying this year might get worse is so ironic right now
4:48 the fault in our stars cliffnotes
Great vid Kurtis, always fun and uplifting to view your creative, humorous and engaging videos especially during these trying times. That in of itself is priceless.
showed my dad this video and he said "this guy's funny" :D
Jeff Bezos' eye!!! 😱 Why!! Why it like that!!??
What morning routine? I need to get up and go to work or I'll get fired.
It’s kinda on Kurtis that that smoothie sucked. It could’ve been good if made well
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Alpha breathing is actually a breathing technique from the new Demon Slayer movie.
Not kurtis saying that 2022 was going to be worst 🇺🇦 #standingwithUkraine
Sometimes I’d dream about pissing myself as well. But that just simply means I want to go pee in reality
Truly love you Curtis thanks for exploiting these nut cases that just don't want to admit their privilege
16:02 “I wish I could iratheuhed ya know?”
At least you were right about 2022 being worse than 2020/21
you know, when kurtis said that this year would be different by being even worse…
That shower is sick
I imagine his gf listening to him hissing every morning scared for her life smh billionares
20 minutes of medication sounds more beneficial tbh
Fun fact- some stress relief tea has Licorice Root which can make your anxiety a lot worse. Found this out the hard way 😳
you body shamed Jeff Bezos not fair
16:00 - just for the wonderful moment that is “talking 101”
Kurtis Watch “How to eat fried worms” it will make my entire life to see you react
Dear Kurtis! I am from Ukraine, and right now we are at war, Russia invaded our country 24.02 at 5 o'clock in the morning. They are bombing our cities, kindergartens, hospitals. A lot of civilians died, including children. Russia took control over the Chornobyl Nuclear Plant. The Ukrainian workers are being held as hostages. This is a direct threat to the entire world. Please share information about Ukraine with your viewers, the world has to know the truth. Everyone can help: write posts in social media using hashtags #BanRussia, #RussiaInvadedUkraine and #StandWithUkraine, and demand that NATO shelters Ukrainian sky from russian missiles. We really need any help we can get from the world! Glory to Ukraine! 🇺🇦
18:28 that smoothie is fucking vile
You need to  do a reaction video to true story animation on YouTube 😎😎😎
1000 likes and I’ll record myself doing the Kurtis Conner Billionaire morning routine.
Feels bad. Watching during the first day of the full invasion of Ukraine. Oooooooff. Chief called… 2022 ain’t it🤷
Love how Kurtis is having service-worker nightmares years after leaving
Kurtis didn’t go one minute into the video and already jinxed the year
I need a house tour. NOW. 👹
Every time someone says a year is going to be better than 2020 it automatically is going to be horrible
Billionaire roast stream, go!
I love the evening routine so much
This year is already even worse, considering the war between Russia and Ukrainian…
the Zuck's love for bbq is the only human thing about him
In the words of a wise woman, you can make fun of billionares, they can afford therapy
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Love how casual Kurtis admits to pissing on poor Jenna
If you ever decide to make a smoothie video or for anyone who wants to drink a healthy smoothie that doesn't actually taste bad try this:  1 large handful of baby spinach 1 ripe banana 1/2 cup frozen mango 1 cup almond milk  1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
Kurtis: *pours a tablespoon of water* Me: Oh, honey…
"This year is gonna be... Worse" well
Thank you for pointing out at 8:20 that these tasks are more like uhhh all day tasks. Not to mention most of us who aren’t billionaires still have to work around a 9-5 work week 😢
so this is pretty similar to my morning routine, except mine is only like two hours long, and since I wake up early it doesn’t take up my entire day. the reason for cold showers is, it burns calories, it’s better for your skin and hair, and it wakes you up, i actually really like cold showers but i also recognize i’m fucking crazy and the average person doesn’t like them. (btw tip if ur just starting, set it at room temperature and over the course of ur shower turn the temperature down, helps ur body get used to it) so basically my routine is, wake up, drink water as soon as I open my eyes, exercise, meditate, journal, get a shower, and then get dressed. meditation helps me a lot, water helps me lose weight + wakes me up, exercise is pretty obvious, and journaling makes me more *aware* if that makes sense. also the reading thing also makes sense but i do that at night before bed bc it helps me get off my phone. also my breakfasts are usually smoothies but like- it’s not a required thing. I also drink tea just bc i hate coffee, but like, coffee isn’t bad for you. if you drink it black it can even promote weight loss. anyways i’ve been doing this for a few months and it’s helped but everything else is kindve bullshit? like if u have a good diet u shouldn’t have to take supplements, and the three different to do lists? that’s just super dumb
3:30 if you work hard, you will make billions... of pennies
My morning routine:  The alarm goes off and I scream internally. Skincare.  Brush teeth.  Coffee and watch YouTube until I feel like I’m alive.  Get on with the day 👍🏻
Dude so stoked to hear you’re a billionaire now! So sick dude!
yourdreams mean that youre self sabotaging
The cky inserts for skate made me happy
I think your cold water is colder than the water in LA, also they live in the fucking desert and you're already getting your cold therapy with the -20C
FUCK me i have a to do list bc it organizes my ADD but it’s like. long. and doesn’t include feelings on it. if you’re so out of shit to do that you’re writing down what to feel. i feel like you need to go to therapy. an action that is one line on my to do list yet i feel many feelings throughout
imagine being so rich you can own a jacuzzi and bathe in that jacuzzi every single day. multiple jacuzzis. you could take 5 hot jacuzzi baths a day and 10 hot showers in a big large shower. and instead you make it a “routine” to live like someone whose water heater is broken
I always recall and try to interpret my dreams as try to find the message I was supposed to learn from said dream and apply that to the day. Weed and coffee, and I meditate outside in the sun. I'm in Hallandale FL, so the sun hits nice when ur shirtless after a blunt. Then I do my boxing for like ten mins and get on w my day.
I died at the horny bit.
i can confirm that the "brain berries" and avocado help so much??? i eat an avocado before every exam and who knows why it works but it helps me feel so much smarter
Pls make a video just roasting billionaires. It makes me feel better x
The alpha breathing 😂 HELP
I almost shot my water out of my nose when he said "Little bits of human brains in a bag, yeah, I'm a murd3rer."
Eat the rich
Does this guy not brush his teeth
He straight up stole a Simpsons joke. Brad Goodman, who is a terrible motivational speaker btw, says the same thing about human beings and human doings verbatim. It was a joke. From the 90’s. And this guy means it
Kurtis looks like my grandpa in his 30s
Throw on a pair of Pit Viper shades and convince me you aren’t Dr Disrespect
Kurtis should now do his *OWN* morning routine, the one he made in this video!
the feral joy he had when he finished the puzzle is foul 😭
Hearing kurtis recall his dreams was honestly the best part of the entire video
I know we’re all making fun of billionaires and haha but I want to point out that Warren Buffett is really big on redistributing wealth, so much so that we’ve actually talked about him quite a bit in my nonprofit classes. He’s huge on sustainable farming and ending world hunger and he instilled that into his children as well. They all do a lot of work and put a ton of money into improving agriculture in developing countries as a way of ending world hunger. They don’t live in a mansion or anything or buy luxury items.  Not saying billionaireism is ever okay, but I would say the Buffets are definitely on a different level than Jeff Bezos. I mean if we gotta have billionaires I would definitely prefer the Buffets
Is Sigma Breathing just hanging yourself? Cuz if yes, then I gotta imprrove my grindset...
I only understand cold showers because I live in Australia & when its hot as balls, cold showers SLAP
u should make ur own routine hehe
he looked so sad when he drank that smoothie. It wanst disgust it was d e p r e s s i o n
I miss my extra greetings :(
that book any good?
4:52 This has the same vibes as Ryan Reynolds talking about his baby and saying "that was from sex"
Fun fact: fried worms is actually a delicacy. I would bet Kurtis meant like live worms, though.
Billionaires: "Just work harder" The Working Class they've stepped on to get higher: *literally working harder than any of them have in their entire lives*
I'm pretty sure the alternative morning routine is what Gary Vee does every morning.
After this, I think if I was a billionaire Id just wish I could give it all up to be human again.
Bro I just fucking laughed for an hour about the it’s about drive it’s about power point😭
Put some honey it that smoofie son
For cold showers, I tend to start with warm water and then make it colder, let my body get used to the cold water and then keep repeating it until I hit the coldest I can get. You feel like fucking heaven after you get out of the shower, especially on a hot day or after exercise  Note: im not a billionaire, i just spend too much time in the shower
Kurtis I loved this video, pls do more
I had a somewhat similar morning and it helped me to get in the mood but I admit that some things are dumb here
The best smoothie ever, refined by my family over the last 15 years or so because of my rampant childhood need to consume blended frozen fruit:  In equal proportion: -Frozen raspberries -Frozen mango -Frozen blueberries, strawberries, or banana.  Add: -Raspberry juice to surface level of fruit -Big scoop of plain, 5% fat greek yogurt. -Lemon juice to taste. Half a lemon's worth is often a good amount for 16 oz smoothie, but I like a tart smoothie.  The raspberry and lemon juice are the most important parts, and they are delicious.
😊😊😊💐💐😊💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
21:10 honestly i love writing down my dreams. i do them as detailed as i can. i can get nice story ideas, art ideas, or memories from them. and sometimes i can look at them and remember how i was feeling/what was going through my head around the time i was having those dreams.
🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇
kurtis being real honest with his dream, i feel better about mine now
Whether you know it or not, your pedaling socialist thinking. All while making money from ad dollars (capitalism) on a channel that the country you live in has afforded you the freedom to choose to make. You’re funny but when you talk about this type of stuff, you sound incredibly ignorant.
these guys make me so sad their existence is so empty jesus
I want a ball sucking smoothie.
You can just see his soul leaving his body when he begins to drink his smoothly.
27:20 I know this song but can't remember name/artist, any help?
6:08 By the way you've got nice...big...beautiful teeth
Is the video he's using a reference not just a parody video with Ryan Reynolds on VO?
Aw man you missed the step where you get a small loan of a million dollars from your dad to start a company
'did you know 50 shades of grey was actually named after this guy's teeth?'😂😂
In my most recent dream slenderman was actually just a theatre kid. I’m so glad to finally understand that I really had the dream to sort out my real life issues.
Your nose looks weird.
I'm pretty sure having dreams about peeing on the bed means you're a communist
a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitle  bit of a communist, good video though
6:02 mf think life is demon slayer
Did anybody ever interpret dat dream
The only thing I can vouch for is the cold shower thing, I don't do it every time but it does help me calm down when I'm particularly anxious.
lmao that evil morning routine was hilarious. good bit. now i gotta go listen to the 50 cent / thomas the tank engine mashup
When he said dream interpreters comment what it meant I ran to the comment section, and I’m thoroughly disappointed :( what does it mean
I saw a latte in one of the video clips, so I think it's ok if you have coffee 😁
“then ill do my breathing” holy shit i should not have drank any water. i almost spit it all over my phone and bed
tbh i'd rather have fewer black billionaires i mean for morality's sake
my morning routine: Wake up
billionaires should have all their stolen wealth given back to the working class
why does the guy in the video sound so dead inside like i can tell u right now that that morning routine is actually slowly killing him instead of making him rich
as for tea, just take a mug with some water, throw it in a microwave for like 1:30 then let the bag sit in it for 5 minutes. if its way to hot just microwave less next time. but to each their own
3:44
your unbridled hatred the billionaire routine made your "real billionaire routine" bit hilarious.
As someone with about $5 in my bank account, I very occasionally take cold showers. But I do that either before or after a normal shower, since it doesnt feel as clean with cold water. Its possible to mentally overpower your cold shock response, and it a weird way I cope with anxiety. I wouldnt do that shit every day though, sounds kind of dangerous.
Dude that breathing montage was scary af
*TO-FEEL LIST*
I completely see why you hate taking cold showers, honestly don’t get why I love it so much. Idk I feel way more fresh than after a hot shower where I feel tired. I feel like it’s better for my hair and it’s better for the environment which for me makes me very happy:)
dude why does your blender sound like that?
when i drink a glass of water when i wake up i feel sick :)
Can we just have a video of you roasting rich people? As a treat?
THAT BREATHING SEQUENCE WILL BE MY NIGHTMARE FUEL
Adam Ragusea said it best when he said its easy for millionaires to work hard because one extra hour is hundreds of dollars, whereas someone in a convenience store can stand for an extra hour on end for 10 bucks
He is so funny, reminds me of my ex lol. I realized I need a funny human being in my life
like what i always start with a warm shower and then the middle or towards the end I turn the handle to cold. cold showers right from the start feels like being slapped constantly
20:30 you sound like Scott Cramer
the handwriting is tragic my friend
Hey... How bout less RIP'd speakers/headphones/eardrums. Shit is SOOO fukn annoying. There's no way it helps your video quality, or sub count
if your dreams often involve spiderman, that is a great sign that you are pregogagant with elsa
For what I can tell, rich people are just too dense to realize the circumstances that got them where they are..
Bringing back Asher Roth one dream at a time
Kurtis reminds me of Billy from stranger things, looking great!!
Man your videos are good but you gotta learn how to make a smoothie lmao
"you havent even taken a breath yet". .. hhhahahhah. . . . YES !!!! ... you mad me LOL
I find it really funny how this morning routine takes over three hours. If billionaires actually do this, that's just a waste of time and like they're spending their entire day getting ready for their day.
My advice from those who seek to become Millionaires, create a company, scam people, exploit employees, evade taxes and bribe anyone deemed bribeable. But of course, do all these in an “ethical” way. I did it, and now im a millionaire. To become a Billionaire, rinse and repeat at a 100x scale.
16:01 well said
What about breakfest
6:33 was way too fucking funny wtf
15:29 that’s the same exact tea I was drinking while watching is this a sign from jeff bezos
Huh
Oh no no no Kurtis I saw that.. you didn't write 3 things professionally and personally on your to-do list. You do it wrong, need to start over. But 4real it will probably help a little more if your mindset the entire time isn't fuck this stupid shit, this shit is stupid, doing all this shit is just stupid.
didnt know alphas were mouth breathera
Gimme extra greeting
Kurtis make a video on euphoria!!
i gotta admit it was hard for me to continue this video after the line "we're not human doings; we're human beings" istg i want to trip over the edge of a cliff
You missed a good Spider-Man NO WAY HOME joke there…
Where is my extra greeting 😡😡😡😡😡😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
make a video just making fun of rich old guys
cold showers are only good when it's +35 degrees outside, but you still don't make them like ice cold, just a nice slightly cold shower to not feel like you're melting, yk?
Really funny!
Can I just say it grosses me out when people make their bed right after waking up? Bed needs to b r e a t h
Hey Curtis while you’re at the grocery store could you please get me some Eggs I’m trying to make brownies and I ran out
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Heard about the cold showers thing long time ago.. was like, welp,  guess I won't be rich then..  cause fyck that
giving me simultaneous anxiety and satisfaction with your points about about these uber rich weirdo lying thieves.
Not necessary at all but your worm dream if it wasn’t a bit could mean u think you’re too self indulgent when in reality you’re very selfless  Edit: for SURE needed more blueberries
ur funny
John Oates
A lot of the things this dude is doing in his routine is shit I gotta do to stave off my Anxiety 🤷‍♀️
Sounds like an MLM
The routine you described at the end sounds like the fucking life!!! #GOALS
i tried alpha breathing and i started drooling send help
Can I get 1k likes on this pls?
Thanks for being based
Ok...😂 It's 2am here. I was in the bathroom, took my phone with me(Parents are sleep). The Alpha breathing part started. I tried not to laugh and from this affort, I made a real bad sound, you know... THE SOUND... and it was loud... friends, wish me luck for tomorrow😂💔
This guy sounds so much like Kody Ko I thought it was him speaking the whole time
Dang ur alpha breath stinks 🦨😩
Billionaire daily routine: 1. Think 2. Drink water 3. Breathe 4. Shower 5. Drink Tea 5. To do list 6. Read 7. Smoothie  This is what normal people do, just leisurely and drawn out. Why do billionaires act like normal tasks are so difficult and virtuous?
Did you go to college? I can tell you that training to recall your dreams will lead to having prophetic dreams. I am at the point where all of my dreams come true. It is not a great experience. Terrifying honestly. All the worst things are never a surprise. Always see them coming. Always worried. Rarely ever can anything be done, which leads to a fear of inevitability. Just.. your prerogative.
Where's my extra greeting? 😕
@27:15 thats my favorite episode of goosebumps
Love this channel
kurtis: * actually bodyshaming billionaires * his shirt: please, be nice 🥰
this video already had me in tears but when he described what the smoothie tastes like, I lost it💀💀💀
Billions of dollars are wasted on this guy
I laughed so damn hard at the alpha breathing, I woke up my husband! Damnnnn, son 🤣🤣🤣🤣😁🤣
Cold showers only work in LA where they have lukewarm cold water
12:25 I had this dream. Wait, it wasn't a dream, I think,  after my wife woke me up standing on the bed and shouting at me. I finished the piss in the closet. Fucking Absinth.
Billionaires: Work hard like me Also billionaires: Yeah so I wake up do a bunch of stuff that's not work and then go to bed
Your hair looks awsome
Kurtis: “Make fun of billionaires” Also Kurtis: “What kind of person would I be if I told people not to read?”
"Today you feel nothing" is some Tyler Durden shit haha
If I wanted to follow the morning routine I would have to wake up around 3am to manage everything before leaving for work. I did a bit of calcs based on knowing myself and how long would some of the tasks take and I approximated it to 2 hours 30 mins _before_ I get to eat breakfast (smoothie doesn't fucking count) or pack lunch for work or get dressed. My shifts start at seven.    Also dang ur alpha breath stinks
kurtis is left-handed
If I were a billionaire, I would go on a podcast, and then when I'm inevitably asked how I got to where I am. I would pause, lean into the microphone, and whisper "luuucckkk" and that's it.
The shower just has to be cold at first! You can take a hot one after (:
man screw you for thinking of the four/forearms tattoo i want to get it so bad but then i'd be copying you 😤
One of your funniest videos. Amazing work.
One time I had a dream that it was during the apocalypse and a robot skinned my principal to wear her skin and impersonate her
26:26-27:27, hardest I’ve laughed in so long. You should do comedy as a career.
what ever happened to the extra greeting
27:14 that tiny goosebumps clip just unlocked memories
WHAT WAS THE SONG DURING THE PRO SKATER 2  JOKE IM DYING HALP
Ummm just passing by... I think you can try taking an mbti personality test... It helped me a lot to understand and develop my strengths and weaknesses.... yeah just passing by ...
Oh my gosh I was today years old when I got the „I hardly know her“ jokes . it took me over a year to get that…
Wakes up at 8am and he’s yelling how billionaire have it easy I thought u woke up at like 5:00 5:30 like come on no hate though your just lucky
Tried it, I officially feel like a sigma male
I love sudoku!
Fully certified dream pathologist here, you pissed on the bed because you piss the bed every day with your content, i'll see myself out. *sweats profusely*
MORE OF THIS KIND, YES PLEASE. LOVED IT!
I rlly wanna see Kurtis reacting to the CATS movie lol
imagine waking up at 8:30 and thinking that's early
HEY I HAVE MY RIGHTS TO EAT WHATEVER I WANT. ALSO BUG MEAT IS GOOD FOR CHILDREN TOO
sorry to be this person but cold showers are very good for ur skin and honestly Kurtis’ skin looked sooooo good after that first cold shower!!
Is the billionaire actually millionaire Jim Kwik?
I think one thing he missed is the brain damage from trying to imagine a billion of something
Lol a guy who makes millions by making chuckle videos talking about how Elon musk or bezos created nothing of value, come on man. They are worth billions because millions like you order everything through them and drive their cars lol
I feel like you should be compensated for the amount of serotonin you give me
damn does anyone remember brain training the nintendo ds game
17:54
That smoothie was just.... an undressed salad in a blender. Literally all those things with some vinagrette and maybe a lil cheese or nuts would be a totally fine salad. Wtf lmao
arent probiotics for pregnant women
I have smoked so much weed before bed that I probably remember 5 dreams out of these past 10 years
See some of these things are actually good but they’re clouded by so much cringe that you don’t want to take it seriously. Like meditation and breathing techniques are a great thing to do in the morning
y u drinking boiled water??
I honestly couldn't stop laughing!
I recently learned that Bill Gates earns so much money per second that if he dropped a hundred dollar bill it literally would not be worth his time to pick it up
Alpha breathing? So reach people are living in omegaverse?
Like half a banana and more blueberries would have made such a difference with the smoothie. And more water ofc.
This is actually kinda my morning routine rn accept I'm not a billionaire, I'm severely depressed and unemployed...
So you built your own personality cult and tried to sell yourself as savior of mankind will snorting tons of blow and dealing with underage escorts? Fair enough.
It's actually really good to take cold showers, that doesn't mesn you can't take hot showers tho
lov commie kurtis
Literally all the shit that this 'billionare' does in the morning screams I HAVE NOTHING TO DO. Literally. It's called at Billionaire's routine because they don't have to work. So glad Kurtis is roasting this It's ridiculous!
While I think Kurtis is super awesome and love his vids, his 2022 hairstyle is triggering my OCD so hard that I want to turn into a demon, possess his body and go get a haircut
2022 Kurtis looks like an 80s action hero
KNAWLIDGE
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis: complains about capitalism Also Kurtis: makes more than $30,000 from this video alone   (That's assuming that he's getting about $18 per 1000 views. My source? The venerable first page of Google)
Just realized you are starting to look like weird ale
Ngl that smoothie wouldn’t be super bad if you added some mango or strawberry and instead of spinach do kale
"Imagine you work at mcdonalds" unfortunately I dont have to imagine
the booing at "we're not human doings we're human beings" despite it 100% being something kurtis would say is taking me out
For many years I had to learn to accepts that I had to learn to enjoy cold showers when I take them bc in the summers we went abroad to this place where warm water was dictated by if the sun had boiled the water or not and by the time we showered each day it was already cold. If you showered too early you'd just get third degree burns.
Living in Ontario is good and bad
Purposely taking a cold shower is the most Californian thing I’ve heard all week.
You’re getting more and more progressive and before I thought it was still fun but now your content is polluted by your opinion so much that it’s not funny anymore but it seems like a toxic obsession ..
I don't want to shit on anyone's parade, but there are more black billionaires in the US than there are black people in Canada (as a percentage).
The dude: yeah dreams are you brain trying to solve shit My dreams: my friends and I, in period costumes, enter a futuristic dome cinema where there are 8 groups of people that look exactly like us. I touch a button and the screen opens up revealing a cave with glowing plants. These are carnivore plants, and my friends and I fight them with our magic powers/laser beams. In the end, the glowing plant boss rises from the ground and it's Jack Black. He says he's sorry and we all have tea to celebrate.
i have a knockoff microsoft called BIGHARD
Kurtis roasting billionaires is the thing I needed today, thank you
😂😂 Lol, you’re so annoying. I appreciate your work.
cosmic brownies? mountain dew? thats just my highschool diet!
I took a hot shower while watching this cus FUCK cold showers
Your "alpha breathing" reminded me of green goblin. I was waiting for you to say "sleeeeeeep" the whole time 😂
Blanch the spinach bro xD
Lol that Alpha breathing killed me 😂😂😂😂
To have the time to do this stuff is a luxury. Most of us don’t have time for that. I sure as hell don’t.
youtube didnt recommended me this until now 💔
The funny thing is Jim Kwik isn't even close to being a billionaire. He is barely a millionaire. His net worth is like 2 mill. And like all of it is from his BS scam books and "games" and shit.   Also, the "billionaire" grind set and billionaire mindset looks the exact same as televangelism to me. Just a different god.
Hey past Kurtis. You don't even know about the Convoy yet.
I am ashamed to admit how close your “real” billionaire morning routine resembles my actual morning routine. 😅
I would have to wake up at midnight to do this routine 😩
Seems to me that Kurtis has a lot of dreams that have to do with the airport, that could definitely mean something 👀
this video made me notice me and kurtis are slowly out growing eachother
kurtis did you put a filter on your voice or something like you sound like your age, not 12 anymore this isn't normal
So basically billionaires have so little to do that they just make up this 4 hour long morning routine to show off to make it look like they're productive. When really they most likely don't actually do this everyday at all and just want to seem a little more human to people.  Oh, also to laugh at anyone who tries this and things this will change really anything. Enjoy getting laid off work when you keep arriving 3 hours late and still shivering from that pointless cold shower. I swear that they put in the "I take a cold shower" just to trick dumdums into actually taking a cold shower so they can laugh at anyone who actually thinks this person puts themselves through any hardships.
I guess my brain is trying to save the world all night then. Or just trying to decrease the horny. With imaginary women. Because I'm a lesbian apparently
Bro, you funny AF
That morning routine at the end had me laughing so hard I almost had an asthma attack
I'm 33 and I still haven't grown past the idea that it's pointless to make the bed
my dreams have been nonstop revolving around euphoria and my burning hatred for nate because he reminds me of an ex boyfriend. i believe i was being investigated for his murder? are these the dreams i need to reflect on in the morning? really?
I like thinking about my dreams, but I have a really interesting dream system. It's like I go to the same alternate dimension every time. Always the same location I revisit in different dreams with different things happening. Pretty fucking dope. I've been through the nuclear apocalypse and then the zombie apocalypse after, it was a lot of fun tbh. I watched the flesh melt off my bones when the blast hit, it didn't hurt just felt funny.
Ngl, if I saw you in the streets and didn't know you, I'd think you were from Alabama or something. But Fuck you make it look so good ❤️
Minus Paul McCartney… you’re not allowed to make fun of Paul McCartney.
After seeing your post I went to Jim Kwik's site and, well, I quickly left it...
Arguably the best video you’ve ever made
Not the picture of mark on the board 😭
People who dont drink at least one glass of water after waking up are savages. Probably with poor digestive health too.
Kurtis is the 70s *ahem* film star we all need.
how did he not realize his dream was literally spider-man no way home
it’s so funny seeing kurtis talk about rich people like that just to show his expensive ass house for the next 20 mins
am i crazy, or was there no extra greeting?
You’re turning to be my favorite youtuber rn. I laughed way too much
Where is this clip from? 11:53 ?😁
They make the barrier for entry look like it's not just being morally corrupt, but rather highly disciplined. It's a façade.
I think that means you might have worms
27:32 I’ve seen so much YouTube at this point that I saw the ad coming as soon as you said “You know what’s more important?”
15:12 Don’t you mean _cold_ take? _👌😎_
Oh so your not going to quit coffee guess you don’t wanna be a billionaire then.
LOL
After he took his first sip of the smoothie, he actually looked like he was about to cry. 🤣
the crossover I never needed: kurtis and my boss (the narrator of the fucking morning routine video) 💀😭 I hate it here
Honestly I'd love to hear more dreams. They're funny af
Twins. We got the same water filter 🧜
Nice to see I buy the same frozen fruit as billionaire
Someone PLEASE actually follow Kurtis’s recommended morning routine…chug that mountain dew cosmic brownie smoothie
“spinege”
start the shower warm and gradually makeit cold
Damn your alpha breathing stinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis : looks dead while breathing exercise  Me : sure. * tries it and chokes *
oh my GOD where the FUCK is that bedframe from
I got it! To become a billionaire, don't use hot water. All these billions will manifest since you spend less on electricity bills.
bro thats exactly my handwriting wtf
That Lion drawing reminded me of Beastars help why-
Seriously man, these all books on millionaire only works for millionaires. Rest of us has to work from scratch...😄
Bro us ontarians are bored af with these lockdowns
Who doesn’t think about hydration and oxygen lol
I watched this while doing my morning routine and it started off my day right.
To do list for normal people: Super important things that absolutely need to get done by a certain time frame To do list for billionaires: Whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it
Me recalling my dreams: I dreamt that a cashier in Corsica (France) spoke Italian to me. And then we fucked. What am I gonna do with this information?
The tea you drank while writing in your journal has passion flower and kava. I use that tea with like 4 bags per cup when I am in places that have sever anti-drug laws. I don't drink,  and am from Ca, but travel all over the world. That tea is my favorite option to get that sleepy/zoned out feeling when I am in Dubai or Singapore. It could have been making you even more tired. Expert tip though, if you wanna get high/low off passion flower and kava they totally work in larger amounts (ike 4-6 teabags per cup) or just get the actual plants in a dried form and brew the tea. Kava even makes your tongue and throat numb.
I see you're turning into Weird Al from the 80's.
Someone has an edit of kurtis saying I'm a little cuck right? Otherwise I would be disappointed
I absolutely love the editing on this video! It makes it so fucking funny! Also how dare you, you made me wake up my dog for laughing so loud
Funny shit! 😭🤣 #goals
0:25 HES CSNSDIAN?????? OMG
Idk why he would call it just moving around, but I do feel like stretching probably in the morning is something more people need to do
It sounded like he was saying "hella fresh" and honestly hello fresh should change the name to hella fresh
9:49 my exact sentiment.
"we're not human doings, we're human beings" - That is straight out of The Simpsons. S5E07 Bart's Inner Child.
Your content is perfect for when I'm coming back from a relapse. Lol
11:52  THAT CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD BRO-   Idk if I should laugh or cry
kurtis this has inspired me to now live like a poor person. i don’t have to do anything
nice
its so impractical but it does help to set the tone even tho i suck at it
you look like you play michael afton in the upcoming fnaf live action movie
Inflation of his left eyeball took me out
“I’m a little cuck” I’m fucking crying 😂😂
Dude they hardly work....
I love the shower scenes XD It was like watching a cat being put in a shower, total disappointment and agony lol
when he ascended 💀
Cold showers are uncomfortable, and hot showers make me feel like my skin is coming off. Lukewarm is the best water.
of course you're not gonna become a billionaire from this, you didn't make the bed while jenna was still in it. that's the key.
So I came across your channel a few days ago and was like "huh, he looks familiar" & then I watched the Canada's Worst Driver video and realized you're Canadian and now you saying yous from Ontario where I'm from and now I'm wondering if you my neighbour or something 😂😂 I KNOW YOU SOMEHOOOOOOWWWW lol
I recalled one of my dreams once My phone now has a note in it that says "Vietnam, Sandwhich, Portal" Take that as you will and that is for one dream
How are you one of those people that require coffee but read books
You need some soy milk bro for that smoothie though
16:01 the sound 😭😭😭😭
5:07 but you see the people that make these videos have never spoken to a woman in their lives
comrade conner
Google says “It is common to dream of eating worms or worms coming out of your nose and eyes if you neglect your health. Eating worms symbolizes fatigue and burnout. This could be a warning to slow down and focus on your health; otherwise, your well-being can quickly deteriorate if you do nothing about it.”
I remember hearing somewhere that taking cold showers are meant to help regulate dopamine levels and therefore help with motivation. But other than that i have no clue why people would torture themselves like that regularly
*one week later* kurtis surrounded by models in a gold bath full of cash
I get apples at Panera but that's because I worked there for three years and ate *a lot* of bread
to truly be a billionaire you need to consistently eat mcdonalds
can i have 40$
22:34 I'm fucking crying laughing over this shot for no reason its so funny
“Human brains in a little tea bag.. yea I’m a Murderer” 😭
nice you have the same calendar as my mom in your kitchen
What gets me is how much of this is just the aesthetic and techniques of mindfulness, stripped of any spiritual connotations. Roughly the basic practices a yogi or Buddhist might do, but instead of being about happiness or personal development, it's supposed to help you achieve wealth. They're taking ideas that were invented to liberate people from attachment and make them happy regardless of wealth & status, and making them ABOUT reification of wealth & status. AND they're taking such an ad hoc assortment of practices & interpretations that they don't even do most of them right. If I thought it accomplished anything I'd be deeply offended.
Kurtis I know you drank shitty green and grey tea so drink some Black/assam tea with a bit of milk like we do in Ireland, we call it builders tea because it's strong and actually taste nice, it's nice with breakfast because it warms you up, but Ireland is cold as fuck most of the year so I might just like that part
The face he made “breathing” sent me into a fit of laughter every time 💀
what happened to his double greetings
21:30 All recalling dreams are good for is lucid dreaming and getting over trauma  So which is the reason billionaires do it lmao  and cold showers are very good for closing pores after a nice and toasty sauna shower  But that shit feels like a war crime on your soul and you can pass out if your blood pressure isn't proper SO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL
The guy from the breathing tutorial talks like the millionaire douch from Don't Look Up
Yes I loved this! Definitely do more… Some ideas 10 ways to look better 10 ways to spice up your relationship  How to get into heaven 😂  Etc
Really enjoyed this one!
this is genuinely one of your funniest vids ever
This was amazing video! Thanks for this brother.
Gotta start bingewatching this channel!!
Kurtis says more and more anti capitalist things every video I'm starting to think he's a communist 😳
Note to self if I onet to be a billonair drink smoothies and play Tony how's pro skater 2 preferably the ps1 addition.
I cant balive the video gide left out the 2 out important steps tax evasion and exploiting your inployees.
I'm sorry did this man say he drinks LIONS MANE? Not only is he selling people an idealised lifestyle that you can only achieve if you have incredible amounts of money and time, but he's contributing to lions going extinct at his expense so he can have his precious "brain tea"  Nice one.
You must at least have 50 million then by now. Nice.  Edit: IS IT easy tho Kurtis?? How tall is a tall glass of water? My doctor is always telling me I'm drinking too much And I know if I drink too little I'll be on the millionaire shit. But I'm here to be a...oh, you've already said this  He also says "lion's mane...and other gems". WHICH GEMS?? Wtf is wrong with this guy? This is the worst tutorial in history
Bro your shower is so nice wtf
Who else tried the breathing exercise
4:29 Me eating gummy worms 👁👄👁
I do a lot of these things in the morning (or at least I’m supposed to when I’m not like terribly depressed) like the meditation, journal, and breathing (except I don’t know what the fuck alpha breathing does I just do square breaths to center myself) like I think the creator had good intentions but yeah it’s unrealistic to think that everyone can fit that into their day
billionaires are billionaires because they save money on the hot water bill in the morning duh, get with the program or you’ll never get on the road to success nerd
So does breakfast not exist to billionaires?
Why can’t I be funny like you.   *why :(*
Not me breathing with you as if i was supposed to
i wanna see the videothat's just 30 minutes of kurtis making fun of old rich white guys
Lollll laughing so hard at that disgusting smoothie… I make smoothies all the time and my first thought was lmao where’s the rest of that? U need yogurt or at least some orange juice 😂
loved this video so much, but man...that's a pretty chill morning, showers n all.  I'm still flat broke tho
dang ur alpha breath stinks
But seriously though substitute the coffee for tea and meditate.
You put the most useless combination of things into a smoothie now that is actually funny 😂
the "i'm thinkin' bout drive" bit honestly sent me holy cow
This is shit we learn in therapy as coping mechanisms and bringing balance into our life lmao and with meditations you have to build endurance before moving onto the longer meditation
Feel nothing you say?  Damn I should be a trillionare by now
Honestly I wanna try the REAL billion dollar morning routine and see how quickly I can speedrun death
so billionaires are rich enough to buy more hours for the day  I'd do that "morning routine" and would have to go straight to bed again like..
The alpha breathing scene omg i cant🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i'm watching this video again!!! guys is the 53638 time and i laugh like it was the first
"That's the lie that they pedal to keep the system working in their favour."  Thank you, I've been trying to find a good way to word this. You nailed it!
Loved this format 😎 Had a great laugh ! Not gonna try any of these tho ... except maybe the breathing part, did looked like fun 😂
13:38 i saw that picture of kurtis near the christmas tree and thought someone was watching him from behind the tree 😭
Kurtis I will be trying your morning routine for a week, I'll let you know if I go into cardiac arrest or become a millionaire. Thanks for the tips bro
WHY DOES THIS GUY EAT SO MANY BRAINS ??!??
The cold shower montage legit looked like a trailer for a survival show im-
Canada is big brained
Me, watching this with one eye smaller than the other 👁️👄🕳️
I watched this video right before bed and ended up having a vivid dream that I had a long-distance girlfriend who was a worm
Is that the Savannah Marie grunt? 🤣🤣
Alpha breathing 💀💀💀
Blender I hardly know her
Mom come pick me up I'm scared 13:13
Hi thanks I hate Alpha breathing
Hahaha love the « real » morning routine
Why did he put so little water in the smoothie and then blame the billionaire for it being thick
I think the idea is to make people think billionaires somehow deserve the vast amounts of wealth they control. I have done the math, and come to the conclusion that they don't.
Bro that's been my daily routine for years
In the beginning of the video you mentioned that you felt you where drinking too much coffee and you wanted to be in better shape. You're dream about the Docter saying you where eating too many worms could be a connection to that. Dreams aren't literal but making the figurative connection will most definitely lead to a subconscious understanding on something.
Dream Interpretation: Both of your dreams seem like self-sabotage for instant pleasure. For example, you had a flight but you saw spider-man was playing and you wanted to see it so you ended up missing your flight probably causing a big ordeal and you needing to find another flight, maybe having to spend another night in L.A. which just messes up all your plans. And for the pee dream, well you needed to pee so you did for that instant gratification of release but then you have a peepee bed that you have to clean up so you just created more work for yourself. Therefore pee bed = self-harm = bad ): hope that helps!  (yes this is satire)
If we are human beings, why won't I be things? Why do I have to do things? WHY WHY WHY!????!!? ....uh ...we are human beings ...uh this is so emotional...I m sorry for making US cry
I hate rich people. They are liars and don't help people. If there are rich people who cares for others, good.
This video made me laugh so much so many more people need your sense of humor
CURTIS. Can you pleasE make a new series where you just recall your dreams. That was the one of highlights of this video 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Give him sunglasses and he looks like Dr. Disrespect
This guy is limitlessing on tea
Make more lovely progressive shit like this. Ahh it's too good
Petition for Kurt to actually make a video roasting rich old guys
I mean I had a dream that the vegan teacher turned me into a mermaid once. What does that mean.
Aunty flo is a great tool for dream symbolism. Take what u noticed abt your dream
You could combine the breathing and going over your dreams and do them while meditating and turn the smoothie into either a salad or eat them all separately to make it more tolerable
50 bucks for whoever does his morning routine
What do you think about the U.S military ad? Personally I think my country Russia did way better
maybe you know this by now, but when you're first starting out with meditation or haven't done it in awhile, it's often most comfortable for you to start short then extend the time when you feel comfortable with such. :3 so yeah, like the 10 to 15 to 20 minute deal
dude you get funnier with every video, shout out
Kurtis I hope u see this just so u know legit I love u man. I was having an annoyed day and laughed at this and was sooo happy to watch this. Ily
that breathing time is cursed wth
kurtis is the only man can put an uncle outfit, and still be cute plus look at how this guy breath, i mean, with the time your waste, givin air to your lungs you could make like 500 dollars.
Instructions unclear my wife left me because I was ‘breathing weird’, I also got hypothermia from the shower and I’m 3,000,000 dollars in debt however my brain smoothie… tasted like shit. How’s your day?
I love that right off the bat it assumes their target audience is sleeping alone
The other night I had a dream that I had to eat a plastic toy pony because I lost too many Pokemon battles and the toy pony lITERALLY tasted like cake. I have no idea what in my life that is supposed to be a solution to
The only time cold showers are good are when you live in a sh*tty apt with no air conditioning and it’s 98°F outside and your body’s overheating. Other than that, they can f*ck right off
Kurtis.... I don't like this. Thanks
I think Kiwi needs a sweater for the -20 weather 🥺
my insane former mlb pe teacher told us his favorite part of the day is making his bed while his wife is still in it and i think about that everyday
Not gonna lie, a lot of this advice is exactly what I needed to hear to improve my life. Not to become wealthy or a billionaire, but just to improve my quality of life. But the fact that these people give you these tips with the promise of wealth and success just by doing them is just a scam
how would you do this if you have kids
Kurtis IS a billionaire, but without the money
Bingo Hall of Fame got me!😂
Thanks Kurtis, for the well needed laughs :p
11:53 LMFAO my bf regularly exclaims this at our pup too at random moments, in the style of Cedric Diggory’s father as well, how is this a thing?! 🤣
my brain is smoothie
I would never wnt to be bilionaire, it seems to be best way to take away your humanity
why did the alpha breathing scene kill me help 😭
Too strong for oxygen 💪🏻
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
i cannot grasp my head around having that much money and not ending world hunger or homelessness. when i think about winning the lottery, i always think about what i’d get people/help my friends & family.
50 shades of grey being named after warren buffets teeth is one of the best jokes i've heard
the dream thing is technically true according to psychology, but weird dreams usually are a mix of things that have happened in your life that your remembering
i think the “to feel list” would more so be for self love / self confidence like validating yourself. to feel accomplished by the wins no matter how small they are, being grateful for having a roof over your head, not being too hard on yourself etc. idk some examples ive thought of im tired rn but that billionaire shit was cringe for sure lol
3:25-3:35 literally the message in das kapital and in ten seconds why capitalism doesnt work =)
dang, your breath alpha stinks, bro! (*see description, dumbasses😎...)
I liked this video. I wouldn't mind more videos like this one!
this routine isnt actually that bad. like meditating and having a cold shower are actually very good for you. but some of that other shit was dumb lol.
"probably get A Apple at Panera too you fuckin weirdo" made me laugh way harder than it should have
I do like to recall my dreams and write them down because it tends to be stuff I'm pushing down in my daily life. I find dreams interesting!
Todo list tobe list and to feel list I refuse to believe he can say that unironically I just cant 😄
Kurtis alpha breathing will haunt my dreams
Please tell me you named your dog after harrys song
So you took 2,5h to get to the smoothy and estimated 2h without filming, then still needed to drink the smoothy and do the brain exercise. So I think two hours is more than fair to take as an estimate. If you work 8am to 5pm and drive there for 30 min, you would have to get up at 5:30 am. And you should sleep 8 hours a day, so you should go to bed at 9:30 pm. You would be home from work at 5:30 pm. You should probably eat well in the evening, so cook for 30 minutes minimum and eat for 20 min. Now it's nearly 6 pm. Remember, the moving your body for two minutes was not your workout for the day, so drive to your gym, work out, shower again, drive back...another two hours maybe? So now it's 8 pm, you should be asleep in 90 min and you haven't even touched any chores. Maybe you do them on the weekend? Then you have 90 min to really sit down and relax each day amd spend your weekend with keeping your home clean and organised. I hope you don't have friends and family, because there is certainly no time for them with this routine. At least you have plenty of time to actually work on skills and business ventures to become rich, right...?
Ah yes! Spinach, blueberries, and avocados! The bootcut jeans of smoothies! Meaning barf inducing!
cold showers are horrific and I, not being a billionaire or even having enough money to live really have had to do this because the water heater breaks a lot. and I can’t get it fixed, so  also most people have to wake up, get ready and rush to their job that, if they lose it, or even lose one check, they will be homeless or dead in one months time.
It's a sad fact that Kurtis is more insightful that all the adults I know out together (including myself)...It's time for sobbing into iced cream
:)
Kurtis: my body hurts and I'm unhealthy  Kurtis Dream: he goes to the doctor because he is sick or did something unhealthy Kurtis: my dreams don't mean shit 😴
the alpha breathing knocks me out. Man, this whole video is gold
Although this video is hilarious, I think Kurtis' last point about doing what works for you is the best thing to take away from it, because I find morning routines like this actually do make me feel good, but others might do better w a minimalist morning routine, and that's fine. I appreciate how Kurtis finds a place to input an actual pearl of wisdom amongst the humor. And how he roasts *everyone*
Alpha breathing scares me
Kurtis nooooooo chamomile makes you sleepy  Gotta choose a different herbal tea for the morning
Spinij
I take cold showers because the steam from hot showers makes me sick, and also I run hot so it's really hard for me to cool down.
why were like 3 of his dreams about airports
Blueberries, 1/4 avocado, spinach, banana and ice. I’d add yoghurt too. Room temperature smoothies will ALWAYS taste inferior and not as fresh.
This video was literally so funny  Make sure you eat your worms kids
Just a heads up kurtis headspace is a bit of a scam if you wanna meditate do it to silence
Honestly I feel like a psychopath for loving cold showers. I can't stand hot showers for the life of me. When I first found out that people hate cold showers I was FLABBERGASTED
I too hold off on breathing until I've made my bed and taken my probiotics.  Then I eventually stop and do different shit for a while and await tomorrows breathing time.
I take cold showers bc it's hot and humid in Hawaii and the bathroom becomes a disgusting steam room even WITH the cold water running 😭
Seems like billionaire's morning routines are body-hacking and torturing themselves at the same time.
stinky mustache
i think Kurtis was secretly jealous of the "we're not human doings we're human beings" thing, like he was thinking hey puns are my  thing! 😂
I was about to be like kurtis don’t body shame then I was like oh yeah it is Jeff never mind
I only have nightmares so I hope they don’t have an bearing on my waking life lol
If you actually had the dream about the doctor and the worms, it basically directly reflects what you said in the intro about not taking care of yourself as well as you want. basically the doctor is you telling yourself off cause you feel kind of guilty, and perhaps shame since a doctor can also represent what society and authoritative figures expect of you.  the one about missing a flight to watch spiderman sounds pretty routine and relatable. i see it as your brain's just stressing about your daily responsibilities and making it to things on time. the fact that you missed your flight to watch spiderman could reflect that you feel a bit trapped by responsibilities and want more leisure time. so ig youre probably right maybe you should watch spiderman sometime xd the main thing about any peeing dream is maybe you just actually really needed to pee irl which is an important part of most peoples morning routine haha. besides that, in personal experience pee/toilet dreams represent feeling messy irl. normally i just really want to clean my room and/or do my laundry cause its overdue its funny that all of these are probably relatable to any other person, so its just up to personal feeling if the dreams represent anything in particular im not a professional dream interpreter i just like thinking reflecting on my dreams... unfortunately i have to breathe while doing that so i wont be a billionaire anytime soon anyway i love your videos and it would be great if you gained any insight from this comment :)
cold showers work as an antidepressant and speeds up your metabolism
Okay this was way funnier than it beeded to be and im gonna need you to apologize.  Like...to me personally. But also to the world.
You look like a skinny version of Meat Canyon
i had a dream last night of being stolen and hunted by a serial killer… idkkkk
Please make a video of you making fun of rich old guys. You're way too good for it
It would be so fucking funny if during the dream part he just kept going with describing his dream until like the last minute of the video
apparenty dreaming about eating worms means you need to focus on your health more
I’m surprised you didn’t piss the bed 😂 peeing in your dreams literally means you have to piss so your body lets you do it in your dreams
The billionaire daily schedule video with the stock footage that you were reacting to is literally SO distasteful. Why does it exist?? 💰
THE BREATHING GOT ME BRUH
I somehow didn't realize this guy was so anti-capitalist O.o love it
2:38 very true comrade
As a new viewer (I literally just found you today) this type of video suits your sense of humour and vibe really well so I'd absolutely love to see more :)
ngl it's been a lot of time since I last watched Kurtis, and I've just came back and I'm absolutly happy
The billionaire body shaming jokes at the beginning had me literally crying the delivery was outstanding
13:20 jumpscare warning. I would not be surprised if, while recalling my dreams tomorrow morning, that exact frame has showed up in my nightmares
how many Hispanics are billionaires kurtis blow? why we always forgotten about and left out of the conversation? just cuz the news don't show the shit we gotta go through don't mean it all good for us. oh yeah social injustice has been justified for us. we are finally part of the 1%. pobably cuz we don't cry about it every chance we get. idk why but you guys always only mention black people. projects, food stamps welfare' drugs, drug dealers and whatever else you seen in movies and gta.
2:20 “he’s got overcast in his mouth” is the single greatest insult I’ve heard
All these morning routines rich people make are just their way of bragging about taking cold showers. It's not our fault that's the hardest thing you've ever accomplished and you're so proud of it
I think your dream about peeing on the hotel bed was your subconscious saying this routine was stupid lol
This dude: *explaining how dreams have meanings* My dreams: *Person rides a bike through a 2 wall restaurant and takes my dog who was sitting in my lap. The person puts him in a basket on the front of the bike and rides to a neighborhood. I follow and stop to listen to two little children talk in a 3 wall purple house. They open a secret compartment and a cabinet and throw random toys outta the way until they pull out a quill, ink bottle, and parchment paper. They have a short table and talk about how if the other kids can write, so can they. They both have cloudy eyes and I somehow know they’re blind. I try to go follow the bike kid again but he isn’t there. My brother rides a bike to tell me mom said to go back and I follow him back on a bike I pulled outta thin air. When we arrive my dog is there and so is the bike kid. They apologize and leave.*
the only reason billionaire do this shit is because they're so far removed from the struggles of normal homosapiens that they need to fill the void with just any random bullshit that comes to mind and then make it sound important because they don't want to admit that they're empty inside.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis Conner? More like Kurtis Commoner organizing the masses to revindicate the rights of the oppressed and
The fact that in no part of this list there's go to work/school/college is very telling.
I'm literally eating an apple from Panera as I'm watching this lmaoooo
Wasn’t prepared for that quick shot of Amos Diggory, got to be honest, very emotional rn
The alpha breathing part gave me a lot of anxiety lmao
“Spinage”
11 days doing the Kurt dawg morning routine and im nearing death
this is one of your best videos imo, the real billionaire routine had me crying
dang, your alpha breath stinks
dannngggg ur alpha breath stinks
The dawn of the first day screen really made me fucking cackle😭😭😭
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Imagine bezos' eye is a glass eye because he doesn't want to go full super villain with an eye patch
i never noticed how blue Kurtis' eyes are until he wore that last blue t-shirt.
With cold showers you have to first make the setting pretty hot and then progressively make it colder but when you get the sweet spot they can actually be really nice
Late comment, gonna get buried - but the fact that curtis couldn't just wake up and spread his bed because yhe has a partner, speaks volume to how lonely and patheic the ideas in these videos about "HOW TO BE A BILLIONAIRE" are. MotherF**kers are just rich and lonely. I mean, when you exploit people for profits, eventually you'd even sell your own grandmother's ashes. That my take .🤷‍♂️
I have never seen Kurtis look so sad before as he does drinking the smoothie
Me who likes to interpret my dreams: *Gaslight GATEKEEP girlboss*
26:57 I'm a woman, I already do that.
I walk my dog in the morning for 30 minutes, I don't need that 2 minutes extra 😂
Actually, I switched to cold showers and I'm earning a ton of money, it's a miracle..  Jk, jk.. but it does benefit your hair and your body, makes it healthier 😊
Oof “the playing field isnt very even” welll i mean there are MUCH and i mean about double or more “white” people of many backgrounds than black soo the numbers kinda check out going along the lines of some are born into it, sorry had to say it😅 also realized its not contained to america so most are probably asian and welllll following the history of africa and their leaders throughout history since about 1300 have basically literally sold their people then put their money in themselves while keeping the rest of the population down willingly and asked for companies and european countries (after and even during imperialism) and got paid HANSOMLY to help their people get educated and do things almost right, but they have historically kept the wealth to a certain group and taken advantage of their population for literally using them for only labor until death and also constantly took over other tribes and surrounding peoples (yes african people) for these ventures never trying to educate and actually get all together and help everyone, because that would deminish the high class, and the high class and massivly rich and powerful in africa are notorious for making sure only them and who they specifically want will see that money no matter where it came from, this stems from african warlords themselves only using slaves (other tribes) to sell to europeans during colonizations and such and even after until the world said slavery is wrong then they had no buisness and no excess money to educate the rest of their peoples who probably hated them because most were forcfully brought in to work for them or be sold. This is sadly why africa is so poor and in such turmoil and its still going on just in different ways even after A LOT of help from other countries, pretty much have done the same thing for the most part just sold out to companies and well the rich stay rich and the rest are poor and uneducated. Its super sad:/
Kurtis is just dunking on every person who’s ever kept a dream journal wow
is it just me or does he look like joe exotic in the frame at 13:11
The smoothie scene killed me 🤣
26:20 i've never laughed harder in my life
I enjoy the majority of your content but your ignorance really shines in this video.
I recently switched from coffee to tea, mostly to save money, becuase 40 large tea bags is like $4, and a good pound of coffee is $20, for death wish coffee, which is my favorite coffee, I tried going back to cheaper coffees of my highschool and college days, and I decided it was better to drink tea lol.
16:03 the glitch
the morning routine u gave me at the end sounds like my morning routine😅😅
warren buffet is like the only good rich old guy because he donates to the zoo where he lives because his wife died of cancer and that was her favorite place. i used to live in the same city as him and that zoo is like in the top 10 zoos in america like it’s so nice and most of the animals are free rather than locked in cages and stuff
sigma males are just yassified witches
dang ur alpha breath stinks
as a panera employee, everyone who orders an apple is most certainly a cold shower person
My husband is a personal trainer and he has explained the physiological benefits of going from really cold to really hot (ice bath then sauna and repeat) but I cannot stress enough how little I care about that because cold showers are Evil Incarnate.
By the way, the cleaning office bit happens  or was lost between the to do feel and stuff list???
By the way, the cleaning office bit happens  or was lost between the to do feel and stuff list???
didnt ask to be reminded of cedric diggory's d3ath scene so abruptly but thanks kurtis
17:18 *spinaj*
I am not at all a spiritual person or anything, but when I started meditating I really loved it. It really helps my anxiety and only feels a little weird for the first day or two.
Please keep making fun of rich old guys
kurtis is so pretty
Him pissing on the bed in his dream is signifying that he thinks this Billionaire morning routine is pissy since make his bed is the next step. I would know. I am a professional dog walker.
KURTIS DID NOT DO HIS INTRO
Let's all agree real quick, that his house looks like a lesbians house. Lesbian Kurtis
dang ur alpha breath stinks kurtis 💔
i think kurtis’ proposed billionaire morning routine will actually kill anyone who tries it. and since it’s targeted towards billionaires, that’s praxis 😎
the alpha breathing part 😭😭😭😭
Dang your alpha breath stinks
4:35 that’s crazy because just before you said that I was thinking “my dreams are like, me being chased by worms” 😂
I'm so glad Mario Lopez has finally gotten so many followers! Where's the magic videos though!
Completely unrelated to this video, but please reclaim your title in the speedrun!! 2 weeks ago, you got pushed to 4th. Show them who the true master of the Waialae Country Club is!!!!
Accidentally fell off my bean bag like twice watching this from how much i was laughing 💀
I kind of like to be lists, it helps me be more intentional and more gently with myself as I go through my day cause I made a conscious decision to do so   Also I’m pretty sure when he listed those ingredients for the smoothie he didn’t mean altogether i was like noooooo  But yeah this is just a morning routine and has nothing to do with having money lol
Bingo hall of fame 😂😂
love this
God bless u !!!!! !!!!!
YOUR HOUSE IS SO COOL
dang ur alpha breathe stinks
how did you get your arm back, lizard      (only spider-man fans will get it)
I knew Kurtis for so long and his jokes just made me realize I haven't subscribed, already messing up this billionaire mindset.
the commy propaganda here,,,,,,,,,,i love it
Kurtis you got something on your mustache
Honestly my dreams are all nightmares and I always end up dead in them. So, if dreams are supposed to give you solutions…I’m not off to a good start.
this is definitely one of those videos I instinctually go to press like multiple times throughout
wait headspace wasn't the sponsor?
Use me as voting yes for Kurtis doing more routine videos😡
Gotta say, making your bed, drinking water, meditating, and reading are pretty good things to "buy"
This guy spends his whole day getting ready for his day
Laughed out loud at the smoothie
Bruh u gonna turn into a lizard?
I had a dream that I met kurtis because he was sweeping the carpet of an olive garden. I ate my food and then I went outside and kurtis drove away on a big big boat
I would just like to brag that Kurtis Conner and I have the same blender
As a certified dream interpreter, I can confidently say all of the dreams Kurtis described at 12:00 mean the exact same thing. Those dreams mean he was sleeping.
Holy shit the change from the first day to the last day looks so weird. Billionaires are weird
I’m a big fan of the anti billionaire talk
No no no dude…. that was a morning Concerto
please don’t watch the Cats movie. it was the last film I saw in theaters before the pandemic and I regret every minute of it
Kurtis, you showed up as one of those annoying influencers shilling shit in a midroll ad.  It's time.
"You make a to feel list and you leave it blank. TODAY YOU FEEL NOTHING" This is the motivational poster I need.
That track is from THPS 3, but the call back still had me dying 😂
KURTIS CAN YOU MAKE A VIDEO ON THE CHANNEL JILLIAN AND ADDIE BUT THEIR VIDEOS FROM LIKE 8 YEARS AGO
Kurtis I love you but can you plz bring your bald friend back? You both are so funny together lmaoooo
You got a kickass kitchen man, you and your lady have good interior design taste.
My dreams are literally end of the worlds. What's to contemplate there?
I didn't think I could love you more, but your based anti-capitalist takes this video were perfect  Ps. Does this dude in the video even work?
I can't believe I subscribed just for the extra greeting, and for what!? Total rip off!
Dang your alpha breath stinks
this kind of routines seem so fake. i dont have time
I was hoping for brain training on the ds lite like it’s the mid 2000s and your parents want you to be smart instead of a weird gamer but this was still amazing
I'm a vivid dreamer so I love hearing the weird/cool/crazy shit other people do in their dreams. Kurtis's dreams are short and simple but still great lol
pls watch the cats movie
The speaker in the video, Jim Kwik, has an estimated net worth of $2 million oh my gooooood
The alpha breathing has me ROLLING
The whole moment at 16:00 fucking sent me. Honestly what an ADHD mood, fumbling your sentence 6 times so you just give up and finish confidently like you meant to say "wish i i wish i could id ra- uh, ya know??"
Where is my extra greeting, I have been sent into a state of deep depression because of this Kurtis.
Kurtis can you please also make a video that's just you making fun of rich white guys at some point in the new future?
i spent like 5 minutes trying to find something to watch and watched this shit start to finish. ur content always slaps, kurtis (pls do more vids like this)
Sorry, but u didn't give us an extra greeting 😢😔
was not expecting CKY HELL YEAHHHH
Kurtis look me in the eyes. are you saying “spinage”
Dang your alpha breath stinks
the other night, i had a dream where an eyelash fell into my eye and turned an alien worm while still in my eye, then i took it out of my eye, squished it, and only about 1/10 on the squished body was on my fingers
Kurtis looking like a 1970s average joe who is secretly a serial killer
I think the big question we are all asking and not just me, when is Kutis going full hairless. Full body shave and wax. Smoother then a dolphin. I think that’s what everyone is asking.
Hustle mindset stuff sucks but like, I think it can be very mindful to bullet journal and meditate or to read fiction to centre yourself before your day starts if you're an anxious person. Like I KNOW I'd be happier if I got up at 6am and did some of this stuff more catered to me before I started my day, yano?!
you know what they say. a worm a day keeps the doctor away
"spinajj"
can't help but notice that you breathed WAY too early smh. No wonder you didn't see results.
Why was kurtis so funny this video literally his funniest video to date
THE BILLIONAIRE ROASTS I AM LOSING MY MIND
can we get an updated tattoo tour?
Ppl who have to get ready for work or school can’t do all that shit
12:35 as a professional psychic, that dream means you're gonna be killed by a horny rapist zombie
I am honestly surprised Kurtis managed to finish all of the morning routine in 2 hours😅
"we're not human doings, we're human beings" JUSTIN BIEBER CAN RELATE
I'm sorry but the thought of kurtis pulling the sheets to make the bed while jenna is still sleeping is so funny oh my god 😭😭
I demand a whole video dedicated to Kurtis' dreams
I beg you watch the movie “old” and leave us a review 😭my mind is gone
People with normal jobs, don't have enough time to do this in the morning...
Man, that breathing bit, the videolly stress attack I guess
I tried doing the alpha male breathing and then just ended up laughing way too hard
As soon as he started telling the “real million dollar routine” I just started having a heart attack because that was hilarious (or maybe it’s just from the smoothie..)
On your "to be" list should include "someone who keeps their god damn crewnecks in stock"
i don’t know why but i just always assumed there are cameras already set up around kurtis’ house, imagining he went all the way to set up the cameras so he can record feels weird
enough sleep. Billionaires get to come home and NOT work, which makes it a lot easier to make time for this crap.
Dang Ur alpha breath stinks
This is my new comfort video, this is probably the 4th time I've watched this and its only been out for 9 days now. love your videos Kurtis!
real billionaire - goes to work, wears cheap clothing, is lizard person. false video
I'm sorry but the alpha breathing part was actually so scary
Meanwhile Warren Buffet be like “I’ll have two number nines, a number nine large…”
Honestly would love an episode about capitalism and how it’s an increasingly self-perpetuating nightmare that’ll kill us all possibly within the next century.
Fuck I have been gone a long time. The extra greeting???? 😭😭😭
Dang your alpha breath stinks
the kurtis merch i want is always out of stock literally crying
YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT ASMR LOL
Hi Mayor of Kurtis Town, I beseech thee to make more videos like this one. Hardee har har clappity clap clap
I'm sorry, lion's mane in your tea?
Hope this reaches you Kurtis 🕉🙏🏻 I watch your videos and I love you. So the dedication and discipline is key *** I can interact most those dreams for you if you really care but ide need context I'm ur life to help u.. there so much in yours. And with the thing u want list try the 369 method also learn about 3 6 9 also tell people what u r trying to achieve. I never thought I do yoga but body loves it. Also take it serious without cameras and believe it or it won't work *this is meant to reach you it will 369. And with the list thing try the 369 method is way better and effect. Or works. Also remember we all have different  Routines are own formula to succeed. I hope you continue to meditate but it's so good. Also trust the process and fruit to ur smooth even better then that guys trash. Try to have an open mind because we disagree and on something only recently ur the best tuber I  watch. And don't aim for to high try to achieve for easier stuff you want to achieve. And do it without doubt. I really can speak to much about it or it won't work but dang bro. You've been give me a pattern that I write this you u you believe in coincidences and I get why you do but there's not. And 7 days cud only only alil results. And affirmation are amazing.... I wanna so much more but youtube might already bad it hard to find.  I have faith this reaches you I post this in ur next video you do🕉 hey I'd I my advice doesn't work you can make a video about hoe I'm a fool. Lol I'll enjoy it. My is xoxowave my music account but I took an break now I've learned so much and it has changed my life I w was s suicidal most my life and now I don't even get depressed wake  happy everyday as ND become better every day. I didn't reread this so don't just ignore me for what any bias you may create about me. I hope you see this.
I don't like the fact he chewed the smoothie
i just realized Kurtis town is a real town in Hawaii you should go there
I come here to laugh and I get my wish every time
Love when Kurt boy periodically uploads these documentaries-esque videos
One of the things that I hate about the billionaire advice on how to go about the morning is that they are so dead serious about it. There's this tone of, "I've cracked the code of life, and that's why I have more money than I'll ever be able to spend in a lifetime -- because I get up in the morning and take some breaths while I push my tongue up and down like a real man; analyze the dreams that are clearly trying to tell me something important; take a cold shower and let the icy cold water run over my balls because it's the only thing that makes me feel truly alive; hop down the stairs like a newborn deer because a guru that I work with told me that it would help me connect to my inner child and that's important for optimal brain function in the morning hours; make a big brain smoothie and chug it so I get a brain freeze that I then melt with my brain's hard work as I journal about my goals, ambitions, and the feelings I'm gonna select from the emotion vending machine that I had installed into my prefrontal cortex, etc.".
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Bezos? More like Bozos 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
just gave my bf the best head of his life, now we are watching u
I really loved it! You should definitely do more videos like this!!
THPS2 😂😂😂
@ 27:15 the mayor said your name
I strongly feel that you are leaving portions out when recalling your dreams to us.
Will definitely be trying the second morning routine, sounds like it gets your body up and working!
"OO IM A LITTLE CUCK" HHFIFHIWHFSINFJBWEFKB LMFAOOOOOOOOO ur fucking funnnyyyyy foo
request: video where you get some new outfits by shopping with a personal stylist !!!!!!!!
his hair after bath ...eyeballs went heart
Was I the only one doing the alpha breathing with him
dang ur alpha breath stinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Every time you breathed I got so uncomfortable
Kurtis can you do a review on the American show 'Idiotest' Its like a game show and the host is so rude and just makes the contestants look really stupid. I feel like this would be a good thing for content because it's on the same channel as the show you've already made a video on..... 'Baggage'
i normally watch stuff on tv, so i get lazy and don't usually... get out my phone and find the video again to comment...   but i wanted to say!! i loved watching ya do something different, and i'm sure i and everyone else would enjoy watching ya do more stuff like this!!
I actually love Jim xD I love that video so seeing other point of view was crazy xdxdxd
the amount of brain stuff this guy does, makes you think billionaires are zombies
Next video: I followed Kurtis Conners morning routine for a week
to be and to feel lists are just the watered down fragile masculinity version of affirmations
I love how "and they look out for the little guy" is an actual punchline which doesn't need any explaining in order for us to know it's sarcasm
He’s so beautiful
“today you feel nothing” SEND ME OVER THE EDGE GOD
Sick mullet dude👍
the fart made the mediation funny indeed
I think the cringiest part about rich people is that they think that every little thing in life is makeable. It's not dude, people work shitty jobs, loose people they love, hearts get broken, that's life. Can't fix that with a brain smoothie.
🏺
Maybe they're billionaires because they save so much money on hot water
Kurtis’s handwriting looks like that of the 4th grader who wears the same spiderman shirt and blue shorts every day and every season
DON'T WATCH CAT'S gosh That's 2 hours and 30 minutes I will never get  back
Not all billionaires are awful. One time, a billionaire paid for me to go to treatment at an incredible facility for 49 days. He changed my life. Wanna know what he wanted from me? Nothing. This man changed my life.
i love cold showers
why did kurtis stop doing his extra greetings?
18:23 did this canadian guy just say “swAmp” instead of “swEmp”???
"We're not human doings, we're human BEings" The cringe was so strong I exclaimed loudly into my empty, cold and lifeless apartment. I'm definitely lonely and definitely not a billionaire!
Kurtis how did you miss the cats movie, it was a whole thing
Kurtis out here flexing with his Vitamix like we wouldn't notice
your art does WHAT kurtis
idk if i should be proud or concerned that i already live by the "the real billion dollar morning routine"
Not no not no no no please make a video making fun of old rich white guys
Massive Ontario Content, sigma money!
my dream last night was literally me trying to escape a house while being a cat and doing puzzles in ancient ruins 😭
i want more videos like this
1:49
You still have your Christmas tree up😂
i like cold showers 🥲
ok so... i had a dream that i was asking my classmate to teach me how to properly collect worms, and she told me "carry them in your hands, NOT in your mouth"   i couldn't stop myself from carrying the worms in my mouth. me and the worms were both happier when they were in my mouth. i chewed their rubbery bodies and they loved it. my classmate begged me to stop but i simply could not stop shoving handfuls of worms in my mouth.  maybe this is a narrative we all share in our collective subconscious and each of us are gifted one small piece of the greater worm story... thoughts?
"Me who uses Cold Showers at the afternoon and Kurtis visits me." *Constant Sweating*
the christmas tree up in january
I find, personally, I like to have a cold RINSE before I get out of my showers, idk why but it makes me feel better. A full on shower Is definitely too much though
I had a dream where Link from Rhett & Link had a vagina
That man pulled all that out of his ass just to gloat about how much free time he can waste while everyone else has to work
the funniest video yet, this is the only thing today that succeeded in making me forget abt the horrors of real life - thank you :)
why's that fucking alpha breathing guy blinking so goddamn much
komrade kurtis
"I make my brain smoothy" No bud, your brain IS smoothy. You're a smoothybrain.
If your trying to find a bad movie to watch then watch the babysitter
Comrade Kurt
kurt can jerk??!!?? best mayor ever😍
The worm dream actually makes a lot of sense. You've mentioned that you feel you aren't in the best shape and that you've been drinking too much coffee and wine. We would consider worms as something that our body doesn't need right?.. RIGHT? We don't actually NeEd coffee and wine(*single tear), and excessive amounts will cause us to feel unwell. The doctor in your dream means it is about your health, and the worms are the coffee, wine, whatever, that you feel you're having too much of. Eating in dreams can represent trying to fill a void in our waking life.   Our dreams are like riddles that our subconscious is using to help us understand our experiences! Write down as many details as you can remember, especially the weird ones, then research the dream meanings of each. ❤
vroom vroom up with jake car car yay
The intro gives me "eat the rich" energy
can recalling that one dream i had where the first episode of futurama combined with my hero academia and demon slayer then turned into a soap opera make me a billionaire 🤔
We want more of Kiwi the dog!
It’s a reading nook, not a journaling corner!
“You haven’t even taken a breath yet dude?”
1:59  bullying works ❤️
I’m watching this while hungover at the gym thank you Kurtis for this amazing entertainment to get me through this gym sesh
link the puzzle game! it's cute!
dang our alphabet sinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Everytime you shower you need to lean into the cold and shadow box until it warms up. Apparently the shock is similar to being stabbed, and you should train your body to fight through it.
Coffee is brain tea now
nice video
I'm probably not in my best mental state, but the alternative routine he suggested just SENT me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
9:49 - great meme template there
dang ur alpha breath stinks
16:03 Kurtis you just gave me a stroke-
can’t believe u said “fuck sudoku” unsubscribing😡 /j
idk about y’all but i recall my dreams at the most random times if it’s not when i first wake up
uhhhh... are we watching the same video bc I'm watching an ad for wicked clothes????
comrade kurtis
Where's that "that's my boy" clip from. It sounds so familiar.
This dudes morning routine is almost exactly what I had to do everyday when I was in the psych ward.
More of these videos pls:)
kurtis, pls tell jenna she is very good at interior decorating!!
these are just good holistic practices that could help anyone, that have been co-opted by bro culture in a weird way. I actually try to do most of these things every morning but deff dont lol, i would be so much healthier if i did tho.
kurtis denouncing capitalism is what i needed today
Four easy payments of 30 seconds.
you look like the main character of a weird 70's-80's comedy show. in a good way
“alpha breathing”?? i’m gonna have to start calling people “beta breathers”. that’s a creative insult if i’ve ever heard one
When I dyed my cherry red, it was the first time I had dyed it a semi permanent color and wanted it to last a phat minute and so I took cold showers so the dye wouldn’t wash out quickly... yeah long story short they sucked and I gave them up after a week and a half
when are u restocking ur merch? (specifically they grey vrg hoodie) also i loved this video! :)
Kurtis’s house is much more stylish than I imagined. I guess I forgot that he lives with another human being and is an adult man with money. I just assumed he lived in a mostly empty flat with a gamer chair and a mattress on the floor.
Dang your alpha breath stinks!
litter
APLHA BREATHE????? Djaodkakdjaksjak
What you need for a good smoothie is a bit more fruit, milk or silk, spinach, carrots and then blended well. It looks like you didn’t blend it for long enough should be ultra smooth not chunky.
Fun fact: 've started watching this video 3 times this week and fallen asleep all three times. I don't know how it ends! Is it a secret cure to insomnia?
where's the morning poop? do billionaires even poop?
My dad got a job where he goes to dinner with old billionaires to sell em Business bc nobody else wants to 😭 he makes a PRETTY penny doing it though also free dinner so that’s cool 😩
I have that exact same blender
What does it mean when you try alpha breathing along with the video and summon a fart on the exhale ?
I know you’ll never see this 😞, but if you could possibly send me a video, of you saying “I know you’re hurting rn, and you’re probably really angry and saddened, but don’t give up. Know that they’re still fighting for you. You’re amazing and everything will be ok. Just know they’re still fighting for you so don’t give up.” Please you’re really a hero yk 😞
Kurtis, please review the 2006 Red Riding hood movie starring Henry Cavill and Joey Fatone :) or don't I'm not your god
27:05   I do not appreciate being called out like that kurtis.
Don’t watch the cats movie
Your house is so nice ✨
Btw recalling dreams and writing them down was actually recommended to me by my therapist because I couldn't remember them. I still can't though so I just gave up lmaoo
Kurtis: I can’t make my bed cause my girlfriend sleeps in!   Also kurtis: let’s crank this blinder!!!
jesus you got a nice fucking shower
omg the alpha breathing guy is a frickin copy of the billionaire in dont look up
I now wanna make a video of doing your billionaire routine for a week and see how that goes…
I need literally ANY YouTuber to try Kurtis’s anti-billionaire routine. Charlie, Cody Ko, anyone.
dood i had a dream i had to choose between my bf of 6 years and kurtis and guess who i fckn chose
If I was a rich man
unrelated why do you look pretty
So true bestie
I want someone to animate Kurtis’ dreams
Yo, not joking, the breathing part disturbed me a bit. Lol, great vid.
What I hate the most is when regular people DEFEND billionaires like their life depends on it. Like they don’t give two flying fucks about you
even right after waking up i can barely ever remember my dreams, like ill remember 1 every month
Of course you have a caniche
Hi Kurtis! I’m a dream interpreter and I’ve been helping others understand what their subconscious is trying to tell them for over five years now.   From what I gathered from the information you provided about your first dream, it seems your soul is feeling lost, and searching for anything to elicit feelings of happiness or relief.  As for your second dream, you’re a little piss boy.
2:16 THE WAY I SCREAMED
How to be a billionaire:  1) Waste all your time instead of working in the morning. (Well I do that everyday, I'm always procrastinating)
How many hours does this guy have before he has to go to work?? Like 5? Give myself maybe one hour between waking up and being at work, and that's including a bus route. I wake up too early for my job to do much else. If I did all this work would start at maybe 11??? I fucking hate thisssss
Was that a hint at a cats movie review? 😂😂😂
You and drew gooden remind me of each other
subscribe to have blessed skin like our mayor!!

Anyone who says “I read” like it’s a flex isn’t someone you should be taking advice from. That’s like how a 4 year old would flex..
He's wrong, I am a human doing......doing your mom!!
Aggressively becoming hella more apathetic as the earth goes on.
9:47 that was literally a scatman john line and you boo-ed it, you're finished

Gret video kurtis
the type of shower was so fucking fancy
Kurtis looks so Canadian he needs to start wearing the iconic rolled up black toque
Trim Kurtis trim💇
what rock was Kurtis living in that he doesn’t know about the Cats movie 😭
House tour?
Kurtis is the only youtuber who makes me genuinely laugh out loud, other youtubers barely make me do the nose exhale laugh
11:23 just wanted to put out this list is asking you to drink a total of three different things before you even have breakfast
oh my god I just watched Goblet of Fire again today. How DARE YOU
Cold showers may suck, but it did pretty interesting things to your curls. They look neat!
your shower is so dope what the fuck
I take cold showers ;-;
Comrade Kurtis
i had a dream that my grandfather and i fought in ww2 together last night, clearly im meant to be a billionaire
the alpha breathing has me in full blown tears 😂
so what I'm hearing is that billionaires don't brush their teeth. checks out.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
"I just feel pissed off now." Yeah me too just thinking about a cold shower 😤
How do people dream? I seriously haven’t dreamt in like 3 years or something
The smoothie need to be diluted man
Learning how to breathe part made me not want to breathe. I felt violated for some reason 😳😳😳
Hey Kurtis do you remember Trading Spaces: Boys vs Girls??...... 👉👈
I DIED AT THE REEEEAL biLlioNarE MORNIGN ROUTINE XDD He's so chaotic
Dang your alpha breath stinks!!
This is therapy for my economics class.       I hate economics so much.
i had a dream the other night that i was taking swimming lessons with beans from even stevens and the peanut brittle lady from candy land so if my “subconscious” is trying to tell me anything it’s just that i’m mentally ill
i literally sit in my bed until 10 minutes before i have to get out the door to go to work every morning
Doctor: Alpha Breathing Kurtis isn't real, he can't hurt you.     Alpha Breathing Kurtis: https://youtu.be/xm2c7R6H1sA?t=396
do a video about your plants pls
why is the shrek part is killing me 🤣 i didn't to expect to see him there
Making excuses for not doing the the literally first thing on the list? That's non-billionaire shit
Mr.conner seen you're disney video u need to up load a video on youre opinion of the  Greates disney movie of all time  (Who framed roger rabbit) you can thank me later.
please review the cats movie
Danny and Drew did the We Are Not The Same Person thing, now it’s time for Kurtis and JJ McCullough to do the same.
People who make enough food waste to really make an impact with Hello Fresh need to learn about fridge stir fry.
Kira and Kurtis starts with the same letter… we need to report to L!
COMRADE KURTIS?????
bold of you to assume i wake up in the morning
when did Kurtis become based
you're allowed to body shame a billionaire
I really want to see him do a video on the fresh fit podcast.
'overcast in his mouth'
Kurtis please add more water next time
omg i am crying laughing at the alpha breathing part
Alpha breathing is mouth breathing through your teeth? That's just creepy and weird.
im only paying attention to how kurtis said spinach
:)
Well missing a flight in a dream means “you’ve missed an opportunity in real life”  And peeing ona bed says a lot about solving problems and releasing negative emotions 🤷‍♀️
I looked up “eating worms dream meaning” and it said it “symbolizes fatigue and burnout” andddd “a warning to slow down and focus on your health”  😂😂😂 Didn’t he say in the beginning he’s in the worst shape of his life???? 💀
Kurtis hitting the jerk 😭😭
After a week he looks so much healthier and younger....considering some of the Buys ngl....
If you’re shoving spinach and shit into a smoothie, why not like. Have a salad? It’ll probably be waaaay tastier
Body shaming billionaires in a shirt that says "please be nice".. That's what the Kurtis do.
so basically, billionaires are aliens lol
2022? More like 2020 poo!
i lost it at the beta breathing: inhale and exhale “awhehw im a little cuck..”
Please make a video just making fun of billionaires
I couldn't eat my Nesquick chocolate milk mix because of this video. Every time I had a forkful close to my face I'd just laugh and it would go everywhere. Ty Kurtis for crushing my dreams.
Just throw on some glasses Kurtis and you can become Weird Al
I have the tea you were drinking I love it so much just don’t drink it immediately lol
generally find you funny, and have a strong disdain for people like musk or bezos, but "it's ok to go against your beliefs if it means dunking on a billionaire" is such a shitty thought process to justify shitty behavior.  For one singular moment, try this hypothetical. What's off limits? Attacking someone's immutable characteristics isn't, as you made fun of his eyes, is skin ok?   Personally, I like to think I have morals, they aren't perfect, but if you're willing to purposely break your morals for no actual benefit other than "haha funny", they aren't morals. they're bullet points you can whip out when you feel like looking better than others while actually just being shitty.  edit: just to be clear before anyone starts crying, I don't care if you make fun of rich people, I'm just saying there's about 2000 things you can make fun of Bezos or Musk for, why go after shit Bezos didn't choose instead of him union busting, or Musks' hairline instead of spending millions trying to make a shitty one man subway
Kurtis hating cold showers. he’s just like me fr
Spinige
24:59
Awee Kurt dawg maybe it's the setting on your camera but them,ssns@&
as someone who works at a smoothie shop, i can say without a doubt that people order that exact smoothie and worse everyday <3 we truly live in a society.
This is my 1st week doing kurtis routine every single day ... 5 whole days and I am actually deteriorating at an extremely fast exponential rate
You can't body shame billionaires bro.... not fucking cool it really shows that you only say what you say for clout bc you're trying to manipulate your demographic into believing you're who they wannt you to be. Now ME ? I'll body shame anyone FUCK EM ! HA lmfao and I'm just kidding if you didn't notice which you most likely didn't bc no one can ever tell through text what your tone actually is unless you tell them 😉  gotcha hat!!
The spider bits on the mustache are the only things that aren't hitting w the lookz the mustache is supposed to be very well taken care of and even, and on top of that your spider bites are very uneven lmao. Trim them down to an even size twinn 🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾🤪
i BEG YOU CONNOR i beg that you add the option of cutting the vid and sending clips with the link with your vid
guy straight up sounds like cody ko
16:02 my fav part
These damn billionaires need to get jobs.
kurtis’ hand writing looks exactly how i imagined
Hey I have that shirt you’re wearing haha cool
Okay but I did not think that Kurtis’s house would look so stylish, bro omg.
Him listing the real billionaire routine at the end made me laugh so hard dear god
every time i hear hello fresh, i hear hella fresh...
Has the video where he roasted Stephen harrison (i love my wife guy) been taken down? That's one of my favourites, and I always intro Kurtis to my friends through that video lol.
24:55 I actually more like games that is simple and fun like that. Like Minesweeper (although I still love to stay in easy mode because the other took to much times) and puzzle. And just wanted tbh, i dont really like sudoku.. I mean math kind of fun but i dont understand how to play it and it too complicated for me.
24:14 Well.. You didn't say what I can and cannot read. So okay I gonna read every morning from now on. BUT COMICS. I am not into talking and describing, I love comic because I can see character expression than imagining it
This is a bit random, but I want to point out that the “three things I want to do” checklist is actually a really great move. In therapy I work a lot on setting very attainable goals, and making a checklist with a bunch of stuff on it is a lot more likely to be overwhelming, and not actually get done. There’s no shame in bite-size tasks.
This guys brain must be extra smooth.
You should write a joke book. Just nothing but jokes the while way through, well, maybe, some activities if you wanna make it a little more interesting. It'll be fun to write. You can do it!
My morning routine is literally  -Wake up an two hours before I need to do things -take dog out -take meds with a sip of water -caffinate -literally sit and disassociate for an hour -get ready and go -
Billionaire Named "Kyle" Checklist: 1. Monster drink 2. FEEL your mom's heavy cans lol 3. Be fuckin REALLY good at lighting a Zippo 4. Breathing
im so scared of you
"ive never meditated before but i think i can meditate for 20 minutes straight, seems easy"
Omg! My cat is named Kiwi!!!!! 🥝
Bruh there are more white people than black in the US kind of understandable why there are less
The alpha breathing genuinely scares me
My last dream is just nonsense, and I think its because of a comic I read. So it doesn't relate to anything irl.  The last dream was about me waking up on a floor and seeing nothing on the window (just sand). After that I go out of the building I was in, and meet 2 person (which is a bad guy I suppose if it's a movie), then me and them just talking nonsense. (I think something happened but I forgot it). After the part that I forgot, I went it to the building I am in before, and meet my teamates i guess? Because it's not my friend irl, some of them is my OC. And we're talking about a group that's popular while eating dinner, in the middle of the talking everything suddenly change and it show me with the team that we're talked. After that, it change again to be me waking up in the place where I just ate my dinner. And I goes out of the building and finds out that the building that I was in was destroyed (I still remember it looks like a building that like collapsed). BUT JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, when I wake up the building is just fine. And suddenly when I outside and take a look back, it was in condition of getting destroyed. And when I ate my dinner and waking up, it looks like I am in a house and not a building. BUT WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE IT SHOWS THAT I LOOKS LIKE IN A BUILDING. I mean I need to go downstair to get out, and when I eat I was in the first floor of a small house. idk there's a lot of part that I forgot, the dream felt like it was 3 month. Sadly I didn't remember a lot of it..  btw idk why but I easily remember some of thing from my dream lol, sometimes I write it down because who knows I could make a story from it. But I rarely got a dream (sometimes once a year or once every few months). I remember this clearly because I meant to remember it, the dream was lovely imo
This morning I dreamt about huge dragons over the Danube river (my flat looks down there), and then i had to run away from their fiery breaths, so i boarded on a river boat. Then the boat sunk titanic style with me and i had to escape through a window. I'm kinda excited now how this knowledge is gonna make me a billionaire. 🤔win the morning folks.
Appreciate you telling it like it is about wealth. tbh I didn't think internet funnyguys who weren't explicitly left would have the guts to just say it outright, mad props.
"in the words of n-sync" proceeds to quote a backstreet boys song
I had a dream that I was slowly being turned into a gingerbread woman over the course of a year and when the final touches were done (gummy buttons and powdered sugar) I was sacrificed to a dinosaur.  What does that mean?
pretty sure cold showers are great in Australia not somewhere its literally freezing
BROOO I JUST GOT A ACTUAL AD OF YOU SPONSERING INKBOX CONGRATS MY DUDE !!!
15:03 Now you know how I feel everyday I must go to school. Since I need to get bath in the morning, it was really cold and not nice at all. I don't have a shower because it's already broken and my mom don't want to waste money to fix it because she's planning to moving. I actually sometimes boil water just so I can use it when I get bath when I have time so I could feel better for myself tho. Also, i don't understand why that "billionares's morning routines" should use cold water. I mean I always want to puke every morning because of the cold and that's why I never take breakfast and ended starving everytime I go home from school.
Kurtis in the first minute of the video: I drink too much coffee and wine and my body hurts all the time  Kurtis’ unconscious mind doctor: you’ve been EATING too many WORMS (nudge nudge wink wink) Kurtis: what could this be possibly be a metaphor for?
We need a collab with Danny,Nick,Cody ko, drew, Kurtis, Jarvis and more.
Brains in a tea bag is just a brain meat broth
I'm not tryna defend billionaires buuuuuuuut Jay Z and Beyoncé are billionaires also.  Just sayin. They truly started at the bottom and now we don't see them no mo'
Kurt boy u gotta watch cats 2019
pls Kurtis my biy watch the cays movie
watch the cats movie ple
I just found out my partner has been cheating…this video made me chuckle. Thanks for that
9:32 Is that means I could be a monkey and sleep in zoo to got free food?
9:10
Btw, why you need to learn other's morning routines.. That's not gonna changes your whole life, that just gonna change your morning life! I think everyday routines is better. But that only change everyday life and not the whole life imo.
I.. Still don't understand how to box breathing or alpha breathing.. I DONT EVEN KNOW IT EXIST UNTIL NOW.. Why I need to even do this when I can breath normally, Why I even think that I must understand this. Why I thinking about this. Wow Curtis thanks to you now I should learn how to learn several types of breathing until I forgot how to breath normally because that's gonna make me feel better about myself. And maybe I could die because I forgot how to breath-- Oh wait I could just breath-syncing
but kurtis you forgot you’re supposed to wake up at like 4am or some shit for these routines 🤨💀
WHY THERE'S NO EXTRA GREETINGS.. I subscribed for that y'know:(
why does he pronounce it like “spinege”
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Billionaires don't make their own smoothies lmao even at home they don't
Stuff like cold showers, meditating and reading build discipline which is important. Dreams manifest our subconscious thoughts which we can then integrate into our waking lives or develop our personalities with.
I started breathing and now I’m a billionaire
but what if i want a video that's just you making fun of billionaires
Do billionaires not take their morning shits and brush their teeth?
gonna do kurtis’ opposite routine at the end for a week straight and record it
Dang your alpha breath stinks
I choked at “Ooh! I’m a little cuck!” I’m deceased 💀💀💀
why do all men have the same handwriting
I GET THE APPLE AT PANERA BECAUSE I HAVE IBS SCREW U KURTIS
Demon slayer theory: when Tanjiro gets mad and humiliates Daki, it's just him alpha breathing.
So the discount billionaire routine is: make your bed meditate move around probably get dressed at some point read brain games  this feels like a sunday morning routine but oof
Kurtis, no!  HelloFresh is a union buster :(
im losing my mind over the smoothie scene. the ominous background noise and his pained, ready to throw up and completely regretful face. Art. im still laughing
I love how billionaires genuinely convince their mindless followers that just taking the bare minimum care of yourself as a human being will get you to their status 💀😂😂😂
Me and my friends have picked up a ton of these skills from therapy suggestions but react exactly like you do 😭 i feel seen
my favorite part of this video is your tiny microphone
dude, COD zombie noise effects hit me in the nostalgia every time
the editing in this video had me deaaad, best video in a while!!!
Wow such hate on cold showers XD I love cold showers. I just prefer cold over hot for most things.
Ok so I didn’t have to but I have a serious dream interpretation for the pissing in a hotel dream since Kurtis asked for interpretations and I’m obsessed with dream interpretation. So I looked up what peeing means in a dream and it mentioned fears and mistrust, so maybe it could be something similar to difficulty feeling vulnerable in unfamiliar places so maybe there was a time when you were on tour when you weren’t feeling 100% comfortable and it’s something your brain is still sorting out? 🤔I’m not a professional but that’s my take.
sometimes i forget kurtis only lives like two hours away from me lol i genuinely was surprised when he brought up ontario LMAO
Kurt try this smoothie! GREEN grapes (handful or so) Spinach (handful) Green apple (half) Pear (half) Some water (or almond or any milk of your choice)  and honey Enjoy!
SIGMA GRINDSET
Can you do a celebe with Maddison bush. We need that lol. Top tier content 👨🏻‍🍳🤌
Dan ur alpha breath stinks
I made a really nice smoothie the other day with avocado, banana, blueberries, blackberries, lemon juice, and a handful of frozen kale. Lots of ingredients, yes, but a great way to eat up bananas that aren't at banana bread level yet and also get some semblance of fruit and veg that both my kid and I enjoy in the middle of the winter.   But am I gonna make that shit every godforsaken morning? Oh my fuck no.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Good god, I needed to laugh today. Thank you for that.
wtf I never thought I would actually laugh out loud watching someone on YouTube but ur fucking hilarious
dang ur alpha breath stinks
This was a great video, so fun thank you
catch me following the Kurtis Conner billionaire routine for a week... or until I die
come live in arizona... it'll change how you feel about cold showers. fuck this desert
Only do this if you actually like doing it all lmao. Also this kinda routine is good for people with mental health issues who need structure and to be more mentally and physically healthy, so this kinda routine does work for me.
Why does that guy sound like Ryan Reynolds?
The revised list had me in stitches, i mean it sounds like a plan 👍🏻
How I start my day : I wake up and realize I’m late to work and immediately go into panic mode
This stuff sounds so time consuming. Like where is the time to actually do things that make you a millionaire?
You should review Flava of Love, the Flava Flav dating show from 2003. It’s so cringe and messed up on so many levels.
The new billion dollar kurtis morning routine sounds extremely similar to my morning routine 🤣
this is hilarious. but i will say, as an opera singer - putting the tongue behind the teeth when exhaling does help relax the exhale. alpha breathing is on to something??
“in conc-“ (transition) *“in conclusion”*
i feel like hot showers when you slowly make it warm/cool at the end are top teir and way better than only hot or only cold showers
16:44  I've read "monkey book" and I was freaking excited
I think I might try out The Kurtis Routine. I like the Thomas the tank engine song.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
plz, y is he so funny
I had a dream the other night that my cat’s head fell off and bounced out of the room and the body was still walking around. What in god’s name is this the solution to?
rick james
Why did you have to use THAT clip???
I cant stop laughing 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love the rant in the beginning. So true.
You forgot to include the daily billionaire activity of exploiting minimum wage workers 😮
i love it!!!! XD
PLEASE react by Stalker by my Doctor! It’s a crazy lifetime movie!
COMRADE KURTIS🤩
I don't think Kurtis plays hockey but the fact that he's Canadian and has that mullet/stash combo leads me to believe he's a hockey god that is forced to do YouTube just so he doesn't make all other hockey players feel inferior and cry themselves to death. Also screw billionaires, eat the rich.
When he said that he makes his "brain smoothie" I thought for a split second that he was going to make his brain smoother. Like just instantly make him stupider. as if he could get any more moronic
I think the problem with "cold showers" is people dont take cold showers, they just take cooler than usual showers and call it cold which is inherently confusing
Some say that Kurtis became so m Ritch that he hired a look alike to continue making videos for him while he went off and retired in Hawaii
Peter Isherwell must be based off of Alpha breathing man because he is creepy af
That Sound bit during that thps2 clip was from cky - 96 quite bitter beings, which was featured I  thps3. Im having some serious trust issues now, kurtis :(
I love how he describes an extremely ordinary health smoothie as a "brain smoothie," you think he "brainwashes" dishes or "braindrives" his car? Lol
It's like he tried to handicap himself with a pervstache and a Camero mullet, but it backfired and just made him sexier.
oh the things i would do to watch kurtis' dreams i feel like they're always batshit crazy
Thanks Kurtis for the alpha breathing clip, now I can wake up and recall my nightmares of it and truly reflect
Mustache bushy
I feel like the billionaire routine is just made to be as inaccessible as possible to make the inordinate amount of wealth a handful of people have seem justified.
my dad has a long morning routine. but he gets up at between 4-5 am and starts work from home at 8am . I think he has a second family he zooms before we wake up.
Please do a video exclusively roasting rich old guys PLEASE you were on a roll there
i'm a huge fan of ur videos and ur comedy in general but this video was absolutely hilarious and probably one of my favorites to date. a lot of the jokes and commentary reminded me of bo burnham, very witty and nihilistic in an appealing way. love ur channel and keep it up!
No, please. You can submit a video of you just making fun of billion/millionaires for 30 minutes and I’d watch it.
Kurtis' shirt: "Please be Nice" Kurtis: "Am I body shaming Jeff Bezos? Yes. What're you gona do about it?"
This might be his best video
LMAO that intro hit so hard, my house fucking flooded immediately after 2022 started 💀 it was wonderful, this year starting with that... 2022, 2022 times worse than 2021. Horrifying
We love you Kurtis, thank you sm for this 🙏
The bingo hall of fame 🤣
This video was hilarious
I live in Brazil, so cold showers? Hell yeah
I saw Kurtis Conner in Dallas at the COIN concert and I really wanted to say Hi but it wasn't on my 3 things to do list..
Capitalism Bros really watched American Psycho and said "that Pat Bateman seems like he's got it all figured out"
Kurtis is slowly turning into Eugene Levy
I love how you know that they sure as hell don’t do this every morning
did your Nigerian prince send you the billion yet
I’ve been taking cold showers lately and they’re amazing…  My skin feels fresh and my hair is so much healthier, obviously it’s not for everyone but coming from someone who hates the cold… it’s not bad 🤷🏽‍♀️
Dude this morning routine takes way too fkn long I have to go to work at starbucks I dont have time to meditate for 20 mins
Im just suspiciously listening to that billionaire video cuz all the stuff that guy said was basic stuff anyoneeee can do as selfcare at the core. So how does apply to becomingggg a person with a humongous bank account? Since that's the topic here 🤣 mayor kurtis was right about this video just being something billionaires have time to cuz not everyone does or the resources
I had a dream the other night that a Wendy’s employee shot me over a $10 gift card
blasting the thomas the train theme while having a mental breakdown is such a kurtis fan thing
Can't wait to see what next years Ontario lockdown looks like....
How far is the mullet planning to take over your head? I'm genuinely intrigued 🤔 Also, I read that the top 10 billionaires doubled their income during covid. Nice.
The human beings line was so headass 😭💀
Ocean breathing can be quite cool, not sure about alpha tho ._.
I feel like I already do most of these things every morning. Instead of billions I got depression. Guess I forgot my To-Feel list..
I take hot showers but I make the water lukewarm-cool when I wash my hair. I have really fine hair and it’s best for my ends. Hot water can damage your hair.
Ok but what happened to bezos eye? Why is one more squinted? Is it a scar?
sound design during alpha breathing? immaculate
Kurtis breathing felt like an Adult Swim fever dream
4:51 what you don’t understand, Kurtis, is that billionaire don’t have someone by their side because they’re awful people :) hope that helps
Okay, this has bothered me about Kurtis for a long time, and I think it’s time I finally talk about it in the comments. At the beginning of every video, he says, and I quote, “if you’re new here, what’s up? How’s it going? And if you’re coming back, what’s up? How’s it going”  Now, allegedly, this means that if you subscribe, then you will get an extra greeting at the beginning of each video. However, this is simply not true.  First of all, nowhere in either of the two statements does he say you have to be subscribed for the greeting to apply to you. You simply have to be “coming back.” You certainly don’t have to be subscribed in order to come back to his channel and watch another video.  Furthermore, you only get one greeting no matter what. If it’s your first time watching one of his videos, then obviously only the first greeting will apply to you. However, if you’ve already seen one of his videos, then the first greeting couldn’t possibly be for you, since it’s only “if you’re new here.”  No matter what, anyone can only ever get one greeting from Kurtis per video, which is a direct contradiction to his promise that anyone who subscribes will get an extra greeting. This is clearly fraud, and Kurtis has been scamming us out of our extra greeting.  I believe a class-action lawsuit is well deserved, and damages of no less than $10,000 should be paid to every class member, for the emotional trauma they suffered from being denied an extra greeting for so long.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
His alpha breathing face is now gonna be in my nightmares
a dinosaur launched me into a lake like a water park ride in my dream, last night.  I dont know what the eff that guy thinks my subconcious was working on for the next day.
Nooooooooo My extra greeting.... Im on the floor crying rn
Meanwhile, I get an ad talking about Jeff bezos and Elon musk and how you can become a billionaire like them
dang your alpha breath stinks
Kurtis, I’m taller than you no offense
At 13:15 you reminded me of that Willem Dafoe gif where he's at the back of a car and he smiles and I can't get it out of my head 😭
ah yes, dreams are just problem-solving situation for a person in their everyday real life, mmhm, yes, therefore I shall indeed call up BamBam from Got7 and we should talk about what phones we have indeed, because that is most defiantly a real life problem of mine that needs solving via calling BamBam. . . . . . anyone wanna pass me his number? I'd love to get on that asap.
Did he do the second hello 🙀
“Middle class man complains about the rich for 30 minutes” maybe this should have been the title of the video instead 🙄
The cruel part is that full blast Thomas theme song and thinking about your mistakes CAN in fact be a form of meditation
dang ur alpha breath stinks  stinky stinky
I tried to follow along with the alpha breathing and I got a headache
Kurtis has donned a retro 80s hairstyle and it's really good
That was such a fun video, might be your best one in a while!
If you don't look at the screen that dude sounds just like Kody Ko making an impression of a pedantic billionaire  🙄
Maybe a bit off topic but I’d love to see Kurtis review Game of Thrones memes
Alpha breathing makes for a beautiful smile
smiled a bit when i saw his afffirmations "my art does not suck" shirt. i love u sm
How did Dan Radcliffe got Weird Al Yankovic role when there's Kurtis?
Shout out to all Canadians on our 7th lockdown!!!
You and your hair looking stunning as always
That was a good brain video. I'll give it a brain like.
i dont like your tone boy............
I'm warning you. don't watch the cats movie
Kurtis town to Kurtis Autonomous Commune pipeline
I just,, have been cackling for 30 minutes
your handwriting is so identical to mine. wow
billionaire bro didn't even say brush teeth or wash face in the morning, I bet billionaires are stinky
How to make a 100$: 1. Make  a dollar 2. Do it 100 times.
The peeing on the bed dream means that you have to let go of something and show your true self, it could also mean that you are about to wet the bed soon, like, if you don’t get up. The missing the flight one means that you believe that you might be missing an opportunity.  So, take that how you will.
Kurtis, I too am now the ripe old age of 27 and I agree, making your bed when you get up (after coffee obviously) is actually really nice. Been doing it consistently for over a year now for the first time in my life and it is actually so good. looks nice and it just feels so wonderful getting into a made bed. I can't believe I never knew this joy for so long lol
loved the vid my keybord is hlf broken but imgine like five exclmtion mrks
Wow Greg,your funny
cold showers are only good when u do more excercise than u should have ona hot day
Please make a video just making fun of old rich guys
meh
comparing getting an apple at Panera to taking a cold shower made me laugh way too hard...Probably cause i work there😭
this just really shows how little billionaires "work" for their money.. they truly just fucking sit around all day not working or doing anything while they steal all their money from actual workers
as soon as he started blending that smoothie I wanted to bust in like I'm Kool-Aid man with a bag of fruit. proceed to throw that smoothie in the trash, where it belongs. then make him a proper sweet, cold, colorful smoothie. Not the mud he ended up with.
Where's my greeting? what about the extra greeting?
The dude literally sounds like it's Ryan Reynolds doing an improv routine. "Then I make...I make my BRAIN smoothie" *giggles off mic*
what that mean
Cover this alpha vid? 😂😂 https://youtu.be/QGQLq_5RyUc
I have a dream journal with 63 recorded dreams in it, but then again, I'm a real dream nerd, it's one of my big interests. Not everyone needs to do that.
it’s so cool living in the same country as Kurtis cuz every time he shows some stuff on screen I’m like “hey I have that!” it’s like an Easter egg
I have the same blender as you.
Kurtis should watch the Morgz documentary
9:12 absolutely unhinged, love it
pleasee review wife swap season 5 episode 16 peterson/vaughn
i would watch a video of you just making fun of rich old guys
taking billion dollar advice from a guy with a million dollars (from selling millionaire advice)... thanks jim kwik
"You're gonna write a to-feel list, then you''re gonna leave it blank. Today you feel NOTHING."
My favorite part about the brain smoothie is that I'm allergic to avocado so it would just kill me
I dont know what it says about my life that the entire morning routine video reads like a bad SNL skit to me
watching kurtis alpha breathe deadass looks like a horror movie trailer
GIVE US MORE KIWI ‼️‼️
I rewinded that joke about Jeff Bezos’ eye so many times because I too hate his eye.lol
A lesser YouTuber would have simply tried to make the bed while his girlfriend was trying to sleep.
KURTIS, react to the sway house stories game tik tok account again lmao they shit post bad memes now
I love how kurtis was wearing a shirt that says please be nice while making fun of crusty billionaires
MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS, MAYBE LIKE A VLOG TYPE
The Majora’s mask reference made my day😂
I honestly love cold showers most of the the time, but then again I love in Florida so that's probably why
Kurtis, I really think the smoothie had more ingredients. You weren't supposed to take it so literally lmao
i loved this new video and your hair looks great
Kurtis, you taking a cold shower was my reaction to taking my first cold shower in Mexico visiting my in laws. "I'm just pissed off right now" 🤣
This entire thing seems more like what a psychopath trying to fit in by taking buzzfeed quizzes would do than an actual functioning human, we just aren't that productive.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Am I the only old one in the room that noticed this guy ripped off the Simpsons making fun of these types with the "we're not human doings we're human beings" quote
You looked different - before & after.  Your skin looked almost glowing at the end.  I hate to say it because I think billionaires are ridiculous too but something about this routine was positive for your health.
this is a wonderful video
I love these kind of videos, kurtis! I would also actually love to hear you and Jenna’s night time routine because mornings are ass
tira esse bigotinho 😀
I'm  literally begging you to make a video making fun of rich old white people
6:00 killed me.  I think that's kind of an issue...
I SWEAR, I SUBSCRIBED FOR AN EXTRA GREETING BRing IT BACK OR IM UNSUBSCRIBING?
Time to recall my dreams! Last night I dreamed that a guy picked up a whole ass dead deer with one hand and put it into a normal household garbage bag that already had a more decomposed dead deer in it. What problem was I solving in my sleep, billionaires?
It's time to let the mullet go, kurt. You know it.
dude i’ve had those hotel pissin dreams before
These dudes get so bonkers because they feel like they need to in some way, justify the massive amount of money they’ve perched on. They don’t want to think it’s a result of privilege or luck, they want to believe in some way they’ve “earned it”, that they’re doing something special that means they deserve their ungodly wealth.
I guess you could say that, that smoothie tasted like Sebastian Skittles Hair Cashmere Army balls :)
I have a quota of one personal thing a YEAR. Three a day is far too extravagant.
fill ur brita
I really suggest having a cold shower when you're feeling sick because it feels sooo good. I did it once and trust me, you won't regret it :)
They really are ARE WEIRDoS
Love the hair and stash, very 80’s
I couldn’t stop admiring his mullet it’s so cool
I write down my dreams sometimes but it's only bc mine are usually really fun
more like this please~!
Okay but his morning routine is just what a therapist will recommend for someone w anxiety.. thats tea.
Meditation can be great for your mental health, but you need to work up to it because it is so hard to just sit. If you do decide to meditate, start with 3-5 minutes and build up from there
Your videos always make me laugh....and think....😂🤔
I don’t laugh at videos and stuff much, but this got me a solid couple of times. That hasn’t happened in like 2 or 3 months I think so it’s honestly just a really pleasant surprise when it happens.
He burned himself so bad it made him have a seizure 😭16:02
I thought the title meant that you'd be spending like a billionaire and be broke at the end of this😭
Passionflower will put your ass to sleep. Love that you drank it in the morning
After that he puts the lotion on his skin or else he gets the hose again
Today I found out that apparently the breathing technique that I’ve used for years to go to sleep is called “Alpha Breathing” wtf
Bro didnt you try to turn everyone into lizards
Sometimes I forget Kurtis just lives an hour from me, it’s whack actually hearing a youtuber talk about Ontario
kurtis you should make a video of just you telling us your dreams and try to interpret them
I love how really rich people have to micromanage everything in their day, so it's not so obvious they are not doing anything. They separate some usual tasks for regular people into smaller tasks and make it seem super-duper important. And then stuff some more pointless shit there. My lifestyle is crappy, but at least I'm not pathetic to the point I have to post these "morning routines".
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
That is my new morning routine now 😂
Millionaires complains about Billionaires   Today a man of the people
Why the fuck did I not get the notification for this 😡😡😡 that's so rude I'm unsubscribing
I actually would believe it if more billionaires did the "real" morning routine at the end of this video
someone please make a clip of 1:58 - 2:02 with no context thank u
This is the most I've ever laughed from a Kurtis Connor video, absolutely amazing!
21:00
Analysis of the “too many worms” dream: you want a better life, which means that you’ll need to rise early and seize the day, because “the early bird gets the worm.”  However, your doctor saying that you’ve eaten too many represents the people in your life who want to hold you back.   Don’t give into them. Rise early. Seize the day. Hustle. Maybe follow a routine of some kind, that’ll help
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Today you feel nothing
I wish more people understood that most billionaires like Zaddy Bezos are just rich weirdos. Don’t idolize rich people just cause they’re rich, because Zuckerberg is an absolute clown shoe.
Dude dream journalling has helped me so much. Now I can remember like,,,, grand stories from my dreams. I used to be really anxious about sleeping because it meant I had to restart all over again or do something when I woke up but now I'm excited to sleep.
Kurtis is voted best hair. Hello Fresh is his sponsor bc he be looking fresh
Any one else think he looks like willem defou
Cold showers suck. But starting out super hot and ending cold is kinda refreshing tbh
holy fuck that was hilarious
i have to say that hearing kurtis talk about the "actual" billonaire morning routine in x1.5 is way funnier
Thank you for saying it kurtis
Non-legit dream interpreter here. Your second dream sounds Ike a personification of how you're actually feeling about doing this stupid routine for a week. 😂
Love the vid but the billionaire thing of being white or black is kinda dumb to me bc it’s not like the white people didn’t have to work for their money but that’s just me
Googling Jim Kwik reveals has a net worth of between $1.5 - 3 million, so he's not exactly qualified to be making a billion dollar morning routine video.
Your mullet gave me sleep paralysis. Hold up. 14:57 your shower looks like this, and you're NOT living the billionaire life? -_-
the thing about not body shaming (at least in public) people that don't deserve our sympathy is that there may be people hearing you that has the same characteristic that you're shaming the other person (in this case billionaires) and could have low self-esteem because of it. maybe this will narrow down our offenses to close to zero idk but we should at least realize this
Are you and Danny and Drew still friends
man i love watching kurtis roast the shit out of billionaires. it brings me joy
i would be happier, healthier, and more successful if the pbntm crews restocked :)
kurtis says he is impervious to becoming a billionaire yet he plays golf... interesting
You’re house is so good! WTH!
I like the harry Potter reference
Cold showers/cold therapy are actually extremely good for you and there is enormous evidence detailing it in various medical journals (along with sauna/heat therapy). Problem is cold showers fucking suck. You can just take a normal shower and end it with like 30-60 seconds of cold.
I'm honestly surprised he didn't go to cool math games haha I would have 🤣
Meditation is like 3000 years old you don't need an app lmao
your voice in this video was different from usual, the environment really changes it wow
hi kurtins, i was wondering whats the worst movie ever and google says its apparently “Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space” so i had an idea that you could maybe make a video about it lol. anyways yeah thanks if u see this and make a video about it i guess 😨😨    (edit : i typed kurtins on accident but its good so whatevrr )
This was hilarious, I want so many more!
I’ve started trying to see what people will make the next out of context Kurtis clip and I cannot wait for them
he has legs?
PLEASE DO A NED FLANDERS COSPLAY
WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT DREAMS ARE YOUR BRAINS WAY OF PROCESSING YOUR DAILY THOUGHTS/IDEAS?!? (I have a bachelors in psychology so don’t come for me saying I’m wrong bc I’ve literally studied dreams) The only thing that dreams have to do with our day to day is that we will sometimes have dreams correlating to our anxiety and also our brains aren’t always creative enough to come up with everything on it’s own so it will pull faces of people you’ve seen (even just once on the street in passing) from its archives and put it in your dream, even if it makes no sense for them to be there. Other than that, there isn’t even enough evidence or research to prove that dreams mean jack shit. Yes, some counselors may tell you you having a re-occurring dream about you showing up naked to work has something to do with you being afraid to show your “true self”, but really it’s them just taking a wild fucking guess. There is no clear definition of what dreams mean and they sure as hell don’t have any correlation to becoming a billionaire 😂
Kurtis!! I think you have aphantasia! It is where you have no imagination. Some people can picture actual images in their brains and some cannot. Some can imagine audio, sense, and smell along with visual. Us aphantasiacs are get very bored easily and stressed due to our eyes just showing black when we close them, no color or “imagination”, just overthinking!
Damnnnn your alpha breath smells like literal doodoo
The add at 6min was a knock-off Ted Talk from Elon Musk, so I appreciated how meta YouTube is in their algorithm.
The idea that the guy in the video Kurtis is following wakes up every day and decides whether or not he wants to be a good partner is so fucking funny to me. Like... what??? Just say you're a lizard person and move on dude
WHY was it not “they’ve got the most cheddar, so they’re doing something better”
Thanks Kurtis. Because of your joke on warren Buffett I actually have been thinking that he’s the one who wrote 50 shades of grey and I’ve been pretty perturbed by that these past few days. I didn’t know who he was before and now I still don’t know. (And I also don’t care so please no one tell me).
Seeing your handwriting makes me feel better about mine 😍😍
I work a PT retail job and work PT as a freelancer so I never work more than 30 hours a week and most of that I can space out throughout the day, but over TWO hours for a morning routine not including exercise. These fucks have NOTHING to do all day. I quit my full-time job because I wanted more freedom to volunteer and time for self-care but being a billionaire sounds so boring and miserable.
The reason billionaires can make the bed immediately because they are either miserably single because no woman wants to touch their crusty asses OR their partners sleep in seperate wings of their 17 bedroom mansions.
ngl finishing your shower cold feels pretty nice, or at least did to me, I just felt a lot more pumped and ready to do stuff and just in general felt better. weirdly enough it started to feel kind of nice after having it done for like a week (I didn't go freezing cold but fairly cold)
i love these routine hacks for optimazing everything that just take regular things and twist them beyond their meaning and turn everything into productivity hacks. turning self care and relax techniques into fucking competitions to get the biggest brain and grind the smartest or whatever the shit. thats so goofy and fully mises the point of it all.
This guy's morning is like 8 hours long
okay but my sister in law has to take cold showers bc she is allergic to her own sweat  wearing masks in the summertime has not been fun for her
pls can we have more of ur dreams, the inter workings of ur mind are an enigma
Your suppose to take ur regular shower then turn the cold on for like a minute
The breathing face is DESTROYING me
hannibal lecter breathes like that
Kurtis, you forgot the #1 rule of being a billionaire. Billionaire's don't have loving relationships with other human beings
Ur review of meditation by levitating cracked me up
Kurtis looks so tired and honestly i would be too. My morning routine is to watch TikTok for 3 hours and then do the bare minimum to get ready
01:51 I think it's the fault of the eyelids why it looks like one is bigger.
obsessed w ur reading nook thx
Either these billionaires are stupid, or they think we are. Probably both.
Please do a week of routines more often!
i asked my mom if she had a to-feel list and a to-be list because we're human beings, not human doings, and she told me "go do so that ill allow you to be" what a legend
tony hawk pro skater 2 was the best game ever im taking no criticism
Lol
this is like,,, a very extended version of what mornings look like at college?? i wake up, chug some water with my meds (Allegra pills are massive and I spend too much time with a cat to skip allergy meds), walk about 2 minutes to breakfast, eat something for Energy And Power (eggs and a baked good most days), find a bathroom to brush my teeth in, and run to class - other than the bed-making and the lists, i do most of the stuff that isn’t absurd and I hate that actually going to breakfast in the morning and getting that movement in makes my days so much better lol
Now I’m gonna have a brain smoothie. 😈🧠
This was BEYOND hilarious.
Goddam your alpha breath stank!
i love kurtis body shaming billionaires while wearing a please be nice shirt LMAOOOO
Hey where's my extra greeting? 😡
PLS THE ITS ABT DRIVE ITS ABT POWER WE DRINK WATER WE DEVOUR
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Honestly I clicked to see the alpha 😮‍💨
What makes that smoothie worse is that frozen blueberries do not taste like fresh blueberries they taste like purple
lmaooo not the bodyshaming with the "please be nice" sweater
straighten your hair in a video!!!
I dont Think you were supposed to take THAT cold showers
I am crying at the end of this one bro omg 💀😭🤣
so alphas r just mouth breathers got it thanks
THE ALPHA BREATHING SENT ME ROLLING
Haven't finished the video yet but that alpha breathing guy sounds like me when a chewy candy got stuck on the roof of my mouth please xD
Ok but I actually have insane dreams. Here’s one out of like 100+ recorded 7/16/2021   I woke up in a really large field, very luminal space feel. There were 5-6 houses spread really far. It was like on big rectangle and on each side was a set of tall sized stairs. I look around then a buncha kids came up to me and helped me up and asked me if I was okay, I nodded. I was confused looking around and then they took me inside. The building kinda had a medieval torture dungeon type thing, very game of thrones in the decor, there was a maine dining room and then like 5 rooms and then a basement. The lady in charge of us, kinda giving promised never land vibes, told me what was up. We cèdent to go up the stairs and if we did we’d be in big trouble, we help gather wood n stuff, pick veggies flowers or whatever. The older ones would do the hunting, they kept these aggressive boars in the basement that we had to kill, who ever killed the most, or killed a really rare one got more meat. The basement is more like the catacombs really, it’s very large. So the lady gave me a small dagger and said I could do it, and I just went with it so me and like 7 other kids went down there I did manage to makes friends with one girl and she showed me the ropes. the boars started running around and we started killing them. I was just watching till I found one, kicked it over and slit open it’s belly. Weirdly enough it was hollow inside so I took off it skin which was blue and scaley for some odd reason. I went to look for more but when I came back the blue scaley skin was gone so I looked around turns out some dude took and I was like what the heck man, and I took it back. And then I decided to split instead I wasn’t sure why but something told me we’d get in trouble if we didn’t manage to kill one thing. So after that we go back upstairs and the lady tells me that what I got was rather cheap and I was like I guess so, and then we got the big shot over here some tall dude got a boar with like gold in it or something. Then the lady said we’d be having turkey for dinner and I was like “meh turkey is okay I guess” and she was all confused and she said “turkey is a luxury here” and then I guess I remembered I was from a different world and explained how turkey was pretty common and how the most expensive meat was like A-5 Wagyu and how you only get one small cube of it but it’s really good. We eat dinner then we have some free time, I use it to look around and then come across a room with a dimly lit yellow light. I see all my shirts in floating vacuum sealed bags. Somehow I was able to also remember that those shirts were mine from a different place but I just left the room cuz I was getting confused. Went to sleep and had a dream about walking up the stairs only for a bright white light to flash just before I reach the top. Then I woke up and the tall dude who got the good boar or whatever told us that it was time to go hunting but outside this time, so I got ready and we all ran out and it ended.
12:49 The Harvard hoodie is a great detail to the attire of a precentious rich boi.         Or not, you know? If you have one you may not be the rich boi. 🤷🏻
that alpha breathing took me out omg
Ok so i take cold showers, but not to become a billionaire or anything, just because i hate myself
big stretch from kiwi 😤
I just realized, this guy has the same name as The Lizard, and now I'm just waiting for him to lose an arm and turn himself into a lizard.
kurtis that is the best morning routine ever i cant wait to rock an awesome mullet like yours while chugging my mountain dew smoothie
Damn Kurtis pushin 🅿️
living for the cky jumpscare
love you gotta add more water to the smoothie in order to drink it like a normal person
this vlog style video was so much fun pls
I personally find cold temperature more pleasant.
amazing content as always
Note to self:  Do not eat while watching any of KC's video...  (Can't keep count how much i almost choked on his jokes)
dang kurtis….ur alpha breath stinks🤢🤮🤮🤢
i really thought that this was kurtis about to flex on us, but i looked more closely and realized it’s just him roasting billionaires and i can never turn down watching billionaires getting dogged on as someone who makes $16k a year
You should do a vid 2000 early dating show. Rick love
NOT THE BINGO HALL OF FAME
Also please make more vids like this 😂
This video was sooo on point …. 😂😂😂 thank you
This billionaire sounds dumb but trying to sound like a smart influencer. As if he didn't do anything unethical to gain a billion dollars 💀
damn, who knew I've been unintentionally alpha breathing this whole time
Is he a billionaire now
I’m just waiting for him to mention “Camu Powder.” IYKYK.
gr8
I wonder if anyone tried his updated morning routine.
Skin looked good after the cold shower tho 🤷‍♀️
i feel like “monthly mental health day routine” is a better description for this routine lmao
LMAO THIS VIDEO HAS ME DEAD
This mans living in my dream house tf
Kurtis just get a extremely strong black tea you have probably had weaker Teas or green Teas which alot of people who like coffee Don't like as much cause it's not as strong
honestly i’d watch a 1-hour video about kiwi’s day-to-day routine, i’m in love 🥺💗
kurt you silly goose chamomile is sleepy tea for bed time you need some green tea
okay idk if its because I'm back at college and I don't want to bother my roommates by laughing like every second, but this was one of the funniest videos he's done yet! Oh man I was laughing the entire time.
meditation amazing, headspace amazing, Eve amazing, imho, glad you enjoyed it
I like your version better 🤣
I can't even listen to these videos without saying "oh fuck off" like 50 times. These people are such wastes of...everything.
Kurtis you should make a video on dumb Starbucks tik tok drinks I work at Starbucks currently and some of them are ridiculous lmao
The idea of that smoothie made me gage
Watched this while pounding down a 5 layer beefy burrito in the Taco Bell parking lot at 11:33pm after a 10 hour shift. So motivated to become a billionaire now 😩😤💪🏻
Brain smoothies made with coffee, ice cream, strawberries, and bananas
No Kurtis, please make a whole video roasting billionaires
i appreciate u so much kurty ur vids make me happy and the dedication to actually have a cold shower every day😂😂
It's about drive, it's about power, we drink water, we devour 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“i just had a bunch of fruits and vegetables in a blender.” honestly gonna be my new kurtis quote i use all the time with no context
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Please make a whole video making fun of rich old white guys one day
Okay but your skin actually looked really amazing after a week of the routine 🙌🏼
Cold showers in the summer are great but i wouldn't recommend it in January and in Canada
Alot of those "white" people aren't white.  inb4 "andizemetismz"
love that kurtis was so immediately ruined by this routine that he tried to put an edge piece in the center of the jigsaw puzzle on day one
To do, to feel, to be lists...yeah, that's straight up Scientology, I almost got recruited by a "mentor" with that speech. They took me out to coffee, and after having chat with me about those 3 lists, they reccoomened some classes I take at the celeb center in LA(I live in LA, so I shouldn't have been surprised.)
"You probably get an apple at Panera" is a new insult I will be using. The other day I went there and forgot to say what side I wanted so they chose for me and I was like thank GOD they didn't choose an apple why is that even an option
0:06 people when I walk in the room
The Moving Around For Two Minutes commercial made me belly laugh so hard I cried. Had to watch it many more times. It’s now 11 pm and I’m laying in bed still laughing about it.
thanks for sacrifying yourself to the top 1% demons for the sake of us kurtis.
Yep, getting an apple at Panera Bread is weird.
Oh god
9:11
Everyone at home breathing with Kurtis and the other dude 😳😂
Okay, wth is the song at 27:23. I’ve been trying to figure it out since the video dropped and can’t.
mmmmm spinag
6:37 stop, don’t do that. I don’t like it, no one likes it
How do I switch my auto insurance
4:17  Me, who most recently dreamed about fistfighting Kaitlyn Bennet: *putting on boxing gloves* I see.
Kurtis breathing is what I'm going to see in my nightmares.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
kurtis
kendall roy morning routine (real)
Is that an Affirmations shirt from insta? I love that page.
That's why u r here bruh
funny
indeed billionaires are losers
So I’m thinking a house tour is needed after this?
you spelled "loved" wrong
Kurtis: I want to make my mental health better Danny: I want to be less silly 😜😋😋🤪🤪
The breathing part was hilarious! And I love the curly mullet, looks very similar to Kenny G in 1986!
Your dream of the doctor being mad that you ate too many worms could mean you're anxious that your doctor find you dumb lol
my applewatch personified
literally the only youtuber to give me chuckles out loud, ty mayor kurtis!
dang ur alpha breath stinks
All I've gotten from this is that Kurtis has a very nice house.
More stuff
Kurtis, I would re-evaluate the Hello Fresh sponsorship because they are union busters.
Kurtis! You forgot to do 3 things professionally, and 3 things personally in the morning routine!!! That's probably why you deteriorated 😭😭😭
Anyone else think that the video Kurtis watched was Cody Ko's voice? or is that just me.... LOL
I've never seen this creator before, but the video was so good I let the whole Ad play and clicked the link so he gets that 1/2 penny from me.
I'm an elephant 😂😂
kurtis why are you cosplaying a baseball player from 1988
I’ve always had a “dreams” note on my phone. It’s fun to go back and read them, that’s the only point for me I think
If you want to lucid dream I would recommend doing the first one
13:25 Kurtis is turning into an Australian snake with those sounds and the mullet ofc 😂😂
I highkey recommend cold showers for your mental health but brain smoothies sound murderous
Now I'm going to do kurtis' routine for as long as I can without dying and post the results
I’m sorry but this list literally doesn’t have eat or go to the bathroom… more proof billionaires aren’t human
14:00
ngl was looking forward to 30 minutes of making fun of rich old guys :(
Kurtis has genuinely hilarious dreams, I could watch an entire video of him recalling them
I’m such a big Bill Skarsgård fan!
Okay I get the whole making fun of this rich dude for being corny, but he is right about the dreaming thing. For example you (Kurtis) mentioned your bad diet at the start of your video, then you said you dreamt about your doctor telling you to eat less worms. That could be your subconscious mind telling you to watch what you eat.
i absolutely loved this video, would really like to see more like it in the future!! dropped a like to dunk on your dream doctor
There's two types of billionaire: 1) born into good circumstances, taking advantage of the lower class, bo burnham writes songs about them 2) i do the thing online then the internet give me the $$$
Maybe the real routine was the coffee we drank along the way
Sick
I like how the pup was a process of tidying the bed
Bruh the fact that you did cold showers in the midst of this ACTUAL BLIZZARD im screaming
dreams have nothing to do with ur subconscious so if u have a disturbing dream, it has nothing to do with you, or your morality <3
Kurtis maybe it's better to not bodyshame like at all. If you insult someone for their race, gender, appearance, etc, regardless of the person, you're still being a piece of shit  It's one of the things I hate about a lot of these commentary YouTubers. They'll insult the "bad people" at the expense of other people. "I can insult them for being fat, they're bad!" No. Shut up
i was trying to do the breathing technique, and then the camera switched to a super closeup of Kurtis, and I laughed so hard that I spit out my pistachios and stopped the breathing technique.
24:00 feels like an ableist (towards autistic ppl) thing to say
Wow. This is 100% cringe bullshit. I don't approve of violence, but how come no one kicked this guys ass yet?
If you are impoverished,  your mornings consist of waking up and getting to work.
Is no one else bothered by the beginning? It’s not okay to body shame someone just because they’re a bad person. You’re still perpetuating body ideals and saying certain features and bodies are bad, like those features don’t suddenly become okay because they’re on a different person? When you make fun of someone’s appearance you’re not making fun of that specific person, you’re making fun of the specific feature and therefore everybody who looks like that. So congratulations instead of making fun of the loser billionaire you’ve made fun of everyone who doesn’t have a symmetrical face. Weird thing to brag about?
Jesus Christ. Literally have that mirror and rug in my cart for Overstock and now looking for a new rug because my living room cannot be a "Kurtis Copycat Design Space" lolz
dang ur alpha breath stinks
my dad likes to drink green smoothies and they're so gross
your home is so beautiful and cozy!! when is the plant tour coming?
Was that your subconscious way of telling us that you wet the bed in real life?
kurtis is a communist ☭
Kurtis's hand writing looks just like I would imagine.
the guy in the video could've prepared a dialogue or a script ahahah so cringe how he tries to be smooth and fails so miserably
You can never eat too many worms
9:46 the man subscribes to the scatman john theory of life once described in the ballad "scatman's world"
You look like Dorothy zbornak’s artist son in the golden girls
bro this was like a whole week of activities
R u ok kurtis
Hey this video was funny and you should know that. It’s fun to watch you do things and talk about them
I agree the to-do list thing is only for if you're already rich, but for the exact opposite reason. If you're working a retail job for 8+ hours, just crossing three things off of a to-do list (like writing a chapter of your book or exercising or something) is so hard because you're so exhausted from the day, whereas billionaires don't have to worry about being drained from a day job.
What's on Kurtis' Christmas tree 💀
Kurtis can never bore me. Literally always hilarious
i laughed so hard at the dream
Canadian weather, am I right?
Kurtis "I literally had a dream the other night that my doctor got mad at me for eating too many worms. What's THAT mean?"  Kurtis 5 minutes earlier: "I'm in the worst shape of my life, I drink too much coffee and wine, my body hurts like all the time..."  I think you know what it means, bud
the alpha breathing guy looks like the mean guy in « don’t look up »
i like this style of content. you should feel confident and achieved from posting this. outstanding work. simply great.
kurtis finding out that meditating is actually nice is so funny to me
this might be one of my favorite videos ever
Im really glad that he said "if you have the option to shower with hot water" because i sadly dont have the option but i would if i did
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Idk if i like ur moustache or no.... Hmmm..
garbage content like always.
Its been 6 months and i still havent received the jumper hes wearing in this video that i ordered…
I didn’t think I could love a Kurtis video more than the country girls of tik tok. But I do. And it’s this one
Tbf cold showers work better when it’s hot outside, taking a hot shower during a hot day is redundant.
one of ur funniest videos ever I also like that we saw the inside of ur house so I can build my parasocial relationship with you further
dang ur alpha breath stinks
jeff bezos enlarged eye omg lmaoooo
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I knew the smoothie was bad the minute you started CHEWING
Kurtis’s house is much more stylish than I imagined. I guess I forgot that he lives with another human being and is an adult man with money. I just assumed he lived in a mostly empty flat with a gamer chair and a mattress on the floor.
Damn your house is huge
Having a dream about peeing on a bed means that you will be a billionaire in a month
Cold showers are so much worse than I ever imagined. Actual hell, ironically.
Your skin looks better though
Please do a shaming billionares video
Rich people needed to come up with a narrative for why they're rich and the rest of us are not, and the best they could come up with was, "We drink herbal smoothies and take cold showers"?
Watching this while I finish up my morning routine at 3:30PM 😌
"We're not human beings, we're human doings." The Simpsons literally made fun of people like this nearly 30 years ago.
if the whole 30 minutes was just kurtis roasting billionaires i would be just as happy
KURTIS YOU WERE IN A JACKSEPTICEYE VIDEO
I think we all know the real brain game kurtis should've played   WAIALAE COUNTRY CLUB: TRUE GOLF CLASSICS
Omg this video you showed my work played this to us! And when they asked for feedback I said it was out of touch and condescending 😂
Homeboys got hair like Frodo Baggins. One yee to rule them all.
i fucking love your entire prologue lmfao
IDK if he was reset after the tour or what but I feel like Kurtis's videos have been extra funny recently.
Day #1 of asking Kurtis to bring back extra greeting
The fact that my right eyeball is bigger than my left, but I didnt feel bad cause he was insulting Jeff Bezos
i cannot believe elon was the time person of the year. kurt got snubbed
spinadge
PLS DO A VIDEO ON MOUTAN MONSTER 💀
Kurtis, please make a whole video of your recalled dreams 🙌
The dream about the worms symbolize your need to fix your problems. Your brain processed the saying "opening a can of worms" and was attempting to get rid of the worms by eating them. The doctor is a metaphor for your growing worry about your mental health.
I thought that book was called “the money book: for freeloaders”
More like this! More like this!
You should make a video about Daisy of Love 😂
Is it just me, or does some of the music he uses, sound like it's from the Fable OST. Not saying that's a bad thing, just thought I heard it
6:25 i am dying
i think these videos where kurtis will do things for a set time, like the wewearcute video, or the country boy video are the best videos
12:25 ._. I had the same freaking dream
We’re not human doings we’re human beings x
THAT'S MY BOY!!!!!
thank u 4 this longer vid i love ur longer vids tbh
Yeaaaa after seeing those dope Asian style trees over your bed, I’m gonna have to request an official room tour for your next video.
We drink water we devour,
I have a really serious job and on my lunch break I watched this and was due laughing! I know my coworkers heard me. Lol
I love water, but if I drank a big glass of it first thing in the morning without any food I’d probably want to throw up. Especially if I’m taking supplements at the same time. Also reading every day is great, but I feel like it should be done later in the day, when you have some leisure time and might actually feel like reading. Forcing yourself to sit down and read in the morning when you should be preparing to do more productive things just makes it seem like a chore. In elementary school we had 20 minutes of reading after lunch and it was a nice way to relax and start the second half of our day. In high school we had it in the morning and everyone just hated it. 😆
Please review the movie, “how to eat fried worms”. I don’t ask for much🙏🏾
Rich people are objectively subhuman
4:17  Ah so when I dream about me sucking the Devils toes, it’s just my subconscious processing solutions and problems 😌 I’m at ease
Please review the cats movie!!!
this video made laugh a lot, thank you kurtis <3
The alpha breathing clip killed me
patiently waiting for someone to try out kurtis' REAL billionaire routine...
okay, but what kinda smoothie is that??? no yogurt or juice in that? just water???
Loved this video, looking forward to more like it
I just felt the *CRINGE* Makes me laugh every time
based kurtis moment
I’d say being a billionaire is less about hard work and more about being smart enough to play the game
10,000 points to you for using the "THAT'S MY SON, THAT'S MY BOY" clip. :>
You did the cold showers wrong Curtis! You gotta start it warm then slowly turn it cold. When you get out the air will be warmer than the water. So you feel like you just came out of a cryogenic chamber. Not for everyone but fun sometimes.
ur so funny i love watching u
Canadians don't care.
I think part of the mistrust is from Bezos looking like real-life _Lex Luthor_ ...you can't unsee it 🤣
2022 will be SO much better if he cuts his hair.
nice plants
I thought quite bitter beings was tony hawk 3!! I can play that on guitar =]  Edit: 96 quite bitter beings
16:00
dang ur alpha breath stinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks :)
We’re not human DOINGS we’re human BEINGS 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
BIllionaires + Millionaires put this kinda shit out to get the normies to do stupid shit like not use a water heater.
I couldn't look away from those two massive HAIR BOOGEYS underneath his nostrils. Lol
Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else 2. I can handle pain until it hurts. 3. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better.  4. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 5. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 6. Life is too complicated in the morning. 7. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges.  8. Stop repeat offenders. Don't re-elect them!  9. Humpty Dumpty was pushed.  10. Evolution: True science fiction.  Maybe the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
u know  I d believe all these habits are going to make someone a millionaire , they created a routine for themselves which makes them productive and motivated so the exact details of their routine does not matter, do you hun learn of what makes u work and think the best, drinking tea is not going to add sth to ur day if u r not a tea person lol
i want more videos like this
Day one of asking for the extra greeting back 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Why did I even subscribe😡😡
There wasn't nearly enough lamenting all my life choices in this morning routine, pass
What about the extra greeting 😔😔😔
That dream says you don't trust the American healthcare system! Insightful! 🤑
i literally have a list on my phone for all my dreams that i follow religiously 😂
the thing about that routine is that i literally leave the house at 6:10 am, i barely have time as is so get enough sleep, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, etc. i don’t have the option to do this shit 💀💀
Kurt hello fresh doesn’t support their workers unionizing, you really shouldn’t support them anymore
Meditation is great but 20 minutes is a lot to start. Start with like 2 minutes or 5 and work up to 20 minutes.
"spinage"
I want more videos like this
Cmon Folx , we all know  dreaming is the subconscious mind working through daily life issues 😄❤
literally the only way to become a billionaire is by trambling on the lives of other people. never believe any of their "selfmade" bullshit. bully rich people 2022
"We're not human doings, we're human beings." Bruh you're a billionaire. You force employees to work insane hours and extract every bit of wealth you can out of them. How are you going to preach about feelings and being present in your life? You have the luxury of free time!
This was lit🔥
Making fun of Jeff Bezos: 😁 Making fun of Jeff bezos for having the same eye condition I have: 😕
Start with a hot shower and end with a cold shower, hits even harder sheesh
Ahoj jsem z české rebubliky a sleduji tě 4 roky jsi nejlepší youtuber
i love meditating i always do 10 minutes in the morning and before i go to bed. you can meditate to silence, frequencies, guided meditations, nature, etc. i hate cold showers also, i just take my normal hot shower and shower with cold water at the end for like 3 to 5 minutes
Apparently billionaires have the same morning routine as fitness influencers :p
I first read this as “I lived in Baltimore for a week” which would probably be an exciting video, too
Bruh why'd you have to use Cedric's dad
haaaa I'm a little cuck uwu
why did I think this video was gonna be Kurtis buying a $500,000,000 yacht
The cringe is insane bruh
Who else has a freaking crush on Kurtis?? 🤔😍😍
amazing video
My dreams would usually get me in some sort of trouble soooooo no
Kurtis looked so genuinely sad after a sip of the awful smoothie
Love ya guy 🤠
Hey you guys if you could help me out with this it would mean a lot really it would any donations are accepted and I thank u in advance
Well your in luck kurtissssssss!
His house is so cool I want house tour!
My morning routine is legitimately wake up get dressed eat then go to work
I love the idea that we need a specialised way to breathe in normal circumstances. Like, we've literally lived for hundreds and thousands of years breathing normally, but no, apparently we weren't good enough. These people though, they've worked out something that works infinitely better than breathing. Its breathing 2.0.
kurtis, this video is a masterpiece, you popped off on this one
4:53 *christian rock stops
Kurtis morning routine made me laugh so hard!!!! I need more 😰
peep that afffirmations merch
Please bodyshame oprah too then, for equalities sake
If I was a billionaire I'd live like Hunter S Thompson and then die at 56, leave all my money to Dominique Persoone. Why? He makes my favourite chocolate, fuck you. no ragrets.
I would like to see anyone who works in a trade and has to be on a job site early as fuck every day try this morning routine.  You'd be waking up twenty minutes before you went to bed.
This guy kills me
My smoothie is usually with banana, spinach, avocado, matcha powder, and vainilla almond milk. I would never have it every day though.
5 minutes in and this is one of your best videos LMFAO so fucking funny dude
23:22 Its actually because they're lizards and reptiles prefer the cold, hope that helped!
You should have added more water to that brain smoothie. It's a smoothie, not a chunky.
This was the best video I have watched in a while. I'm not lying I was literally crying as I was laughing 🤣 . I was ill but this just made my day.
Convo between the breathing guy and his wife. Wife: Hey babe, what are u doing today? Breathing Guy: Today I'm teaching people how to breath! W: Dude, u know that like everybody on this planet can breath right? BG: BUT NOT IN AN ALPHA WAY!
my cat became really scared during the alpha breathing part
It’s funny you start the video with saying you feel your unhealthy with the amount of coffee and wine you drink and then bring up your dream about your doctor getting on you about “excess” 🧐 a little too on the nose?
Alright, but what _is_ the correct amount of worms to eat?
12:30 Ahh. Well, as a cerfified DE (Dream-Enterpreter), your subconsciousness was trying to tell you that you shouldn't take cold showers when waking up like the guy says, but golden shower
Kurtis bodyshaming these losers and looking like ”Yeah? So what? I say what I want 😚” is the greatest thing I’ve seen today and now I feel good
Avocado and spinach in smoothies can be amazing but you gotta put some almond milk, maple syrup, cocoa powder, and bananas in there, masks the flavour and you just get healthy stuff disguised as chocolate
U look like ur dressing up as Ty Turner (in a good way)
This video is funny af 😂 I love all of your videos, but this one just had me smiling and laughing the whole time. Love your content ✨
we want extra greeting !!!!!
Kinda sucks that I do a lot of these things for my mental health LOL
dang your alpha breath stinks
We are not Human BE-ings, we are stupid.
18:20 no fuckingway i once dreamt EXACTLY this. kurtis qas making a gross smoothie and it looked just like that
I can’t breathe the Shrek got me laughing so hard lmaooo I guess I have to start a morning routine too now
2022: the squeakquel
ofc you are from canada s2 you are smart
Gorgeous mustache
17:27
The editing in this was amazing 😂😂😂😂🙏🙏
Praise God  🙏🙏
You look like you write like that
I actually prefer the short glass
props to the guy who does all that shit first thing, his brain really does seem smoothie!
kurtis is the only youtuber i know that makes me pause the video every couple minutes to stop laughing so that i can hear what hes saying
He just woke up and still so funny and sarcastic omg
The breathing exercise was amazing 😂😂😂
i can't with the breathing lmaoooo
how tf are there apparently hundreds of billionaires?
thank you for this video kurtis! for almost two years now i have been so obsessed with building up the most perfect morning routine, and it just got to a point where i was doing so much just in this routine, i ended up feeling incredibly burnt out and exhausted by the time i was ready to start my actual day. i've felt awful because the books i was reading that told me to implement these habits would tell me i'd regret not doing them, or that if i didn't like them yet it's just because i hadn't done them enough times. this has really helped me in deciding what i should be doing in the mornings that makes me happy - so thank you! this video was great :)
Someone please interpret his dreams please
dang ur alpha breath stinks😆😅😅😅😅😅😰
Billionaires waking up and doing 15 things before even starting their days while their underpaid employees probably waking up in the early hours of the morning to immediately start getting ready to go to work under a dude who makes a "to feel" list
personally, i dont like body shaming even horrible people. because it probably wont affect them, but it does affect everyone around you who has a similar body feature as the person being made fun of. like if you make fun of someone awful by saying something bad about their haircut, anyone else who has that haircut now feels like shit even though they didnt do something wrong, ya dig? other than that though, i liked this video.  :)
can someone make a youtube video of them following Kurtis’s beta morning routine for a week
as someone who takes cold showers, i usually go from lukewarm to cold. i don’t jump right in cold
THICC
billionaires wake up at 4am because they're too stressed to sleep well. they rely on meditation to keep from panic attacks and drink smoothies to keep nutrients down. Don't be a billionaire hehehehe
4:30 I know Kurtis is making a joke here but he literally just quotes a dream with a meaning 💀
kurtis, please never stop doing the i hardly know her bit
this is a really funny video LOL!!!!!
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The reason billionaires take cold showers is because the money they save from that incrementally builds up and then they have a billion dollars
no way did you just remind me of cedric's death
Bru I straight died at the end
kurtis looks like Joe Exotic
17:19 18:02 18:48 "spinnidge"
your skin looks orange, you might have scurvy I'm just looking out 4 u buddy
Kurtis giving me the idea to make my alarm sound the Thomas the Engine theme song.
The 'Real Billionaire's Morning Routine' list Is The Hardest I've Laughed In Years. You all have a good night.
Your fuckin face when you start to segue into the ad is always so priceless.. “yeah, you know what it is. Tehe”
I’m so glad you roasted him so much for the human doings thing. He really thought he did something creative and never-been-done-before. A real artist. Lmfao 🌽
Who the actual fuck has that much time in the morning, I roll out of bed; practically piss myself, barely brush my teeth and go to work spilling my coffee that's half beans because I didn't have time to properly grind it.  Actually fuck it, I'll just eat the coffee beans.
I feel like he’s just trying to procrastinate all day lmao
This video is so good!!!!!!! Probably one of my fave
*S P I N E J*
Kurtis!! You forgot the MCT oil in your tea!! The most essential and totally not-gimmicky part of any keto billionaire fad diet!
20min mediation is a lot of you're new to mediation. When I use to meditate daily I only did 10 mins.
kurtis is deadass so pretty in this video i-
Hey remember The Hype House? Yeah its a Netflix reality show now
Woooo a video featuring Kiwi!!!
You wanna switch showers yours is way cooler
idk why but kurtis is so much funnier now than he was say, a couple years ago, its like the mullet has allowed him to really come into his own
very random but kurtis kinda looks like Earl from the tv series "My Name is Earl" search it up if youve never heard of it
new fear unlocked: kurtis' teeth
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
its ok i have a lazy eye too and you should still body shame jeff bezos
The glass of water before coffee is a good idea—that’s what I do.
OVERCAST IN HIS MOUTH  NO
this whole video had me in tears , im fucking crying!!!!
8:52  Man's just had a stroke
The breathing sent me
THINKIN BOUT DRIVE THINKIN BOUT POWER WE DRINK WATER WE DEVOUR
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
I always dream of doing drugs and driving cars 🙌serious deep shit
'today you feel nothing' while staring at my freaking soul
this video is a fucking banger dude
NGL that breathing bit was the scariest 10 second horror movie ever.
That dream you described Kurtis literally loops back to what you said at the beginning of the video.  You said you want to be healthier, and the actual take away meaning of the eating worms dream is to slow down and focus on your health! :O
“And yes I am body shaming. What, you gonna stand up for [insert terrible person here]?” Me when men do terrible misogynist things and I make fun of them for being bald, tiny peen, etc. like yes I am intentionally using their own weapon against them, I think they will survive lmao For real tho I wish more people would embrace using this type of shit on people who actually deserve to feel bad. We know our morals and ethics, it’s ok to fuck around a little
This is the most adorable video I’ve ever seen his little journal is so cute
Holy fuck the amount of executive function required to do the billionaire routine is absolutely bonkers to me
kurtis please tell us where you got the sweater from 20:27
Don’t worry I only take cold showers when everything else in my life also sucks. It’s a balance 🤷‍♀️
Is it me or has he completely forgot to give us an extra greeting .
Can we talk about how gorgeous Kurtis’ room is
All the billionaire roasts had me DYING omg i love this video
i would like more videos like this
kurtis and jenna’s taste in interior design is impeccable
Wah wah wah
Well last night I had a dream that a snake went up my butt. What problems am I solving with that dream, Jim Kwik??
He’s a guy???
he's a guy 😖 oh golly, oh boy!
im from kurtis’ tweet
comment letting u know
i did the morning routine u suggested at the end of the video. im actually a billionaire now!
"wish i could... wish i could, uh- ah- ... y'know." AHAHAHAH
You’re the only person that can make a mullet and mustache look mf good
dang ur alpha breath stinks
1:57 the most comedic silence ever
kurtis and jenna’s taste in interior design is impeccable
I don’t just *want* more videos like this, I *need* more videos like this
3:20 based commie kurtis???
The average working class American does not have this much fucking time before their job to do all this shit in the morning. Ugh🙄
So can we get a plant tour? Is Jenna a plant daddy?
The fact that he lives where I live means that I could just see him on the street… 😳
can you pls stop with the sexaulising comments against women its so fcken tiring and immature. the "im a guy" jokes are so sad, u also have a gf ??????8w7r9???????
Kurtis: they work hard they play hard, Me: and they are hard- oh yeah they look out for the little guy. that's what I was going to say
Definitely want to see more videos like this! You keep me and my husband laughing!
IF IT'S NOT THE EXTRA GREETING LET IT BE THE  CLAP
I'm a woman, we like our showers hot enough to melt the skin off our bones, thanks
I’ll never understand the big glass of water straight outta bed thing. I take one sip of water in the morning and imma be dry heaving
THE PART ABOUT JEFF BEZOS’ EYEBALL MADE ME LAUGH TOO HARD
i love these videos where he “lives” like a person for a week
Kurtis, CKY was on the THPS3 soundtrack not THPS2.
I had a dream my uncle was my boyfriend
can someone please make a video of them doing kurtis' fucking insane morning routine
where's Jacob at I miss him
Pls make more vids like this
Based. More thanks 🖕
It's weird watching a popular YouTuber who lives in the same province as me.
I thought you said "Worm Buffett" at the end of the video. Think I've been eatin' too much at the worm buffet.
18:55 soooo BEEFY
It’s amazing to me that Canadians are still letting their dictators out them into lockdowns.
“Wow! You wake up at 4AM every morning! That’s super impressive considering you go to bed at 7PM!” - Sam Hyde.
recalling your dreams is a good way of learning how to lucid dream. thats really the only point
I work at Panera, and the Apple comment threw me socks off, that’s exactly how I see people who choose such a side .
dang, ur alpha breath STINKS
Your house is so pretty connor wtf
Kurts videos are so scary I love them
unsure whether it's more concerning that I do several things on the billionaire list or several things from kurtis's crazy list at the end (and yes, the cold shower is included, but not intentionally)
What is their hard on for cold showers?? And I love coffee too
kurtis’ hand writing looking like that just makes sense
2022 Jan 16
The Thomas the Tank Engine theme song killed me.
I think kurtis’s dream about pissing the bed is him forcing himself (piss) out of his comfort zone (bed) by doing this 2 hour 15 step billionaire routine.
my dad walked by while i was watching this and said “he looks like Doug Henning”
my dad passed by while i was watching and said you look like Doug Henning
That smoothie made me gag 🤢
kurtis where’s my extra greeting 😕😕
Billionaires will go drinking avocadoes all day and then wonder why they need supplements
I forget Kurtis has a body
cool story bro
4:53 you what????
Why do you have a vitamix in the shot but its still in the box? Are u a cahrazy guy
Curtis aren’t you like a billionaire
W video (im not a bot)
Lmaooo you never cease to make my day with your uploads, thank you for that.
i feel like i'm gonna actually try this
I would projectile vomit that entire glass of water back up if I tried to drink that much water that soon after waking up, I know from experience..
tempted to do the "real" billion-dollar morning routine for a week and record it
Somebody please make a short of the journal bit 😂.
YAS. More like this!
From everything I know, Warren Buffet is actually a pretty good guy. He gave away like 90% of his fortune to charity and he lives in a normal house and drives in a normal car.
not the cold shower slander
kurtis is truly the mvp for doing this lol
I'm earwashing my cats with the sound of Kurtis videos so everytime I play his voice or his sound effects they'll think I'm gonna get them a treat...
Why the hate against Jeff Bezos don’t want my package missing lazy asf stores for losers
A billionaires life is a monopoly hustle 😤🤧
smelt ur stinky alpha breath against my will
please never alpha breathe again, kurt
Kiwi best boi
Enjoyed the dancing.
You I’ve got the same carpet as u
my morning routine is. snooze button, snooze button, panic i overslept, put my glasses on, check my phone, take my meds, change, brush my teeth, grab my stuff, and then run to my first class
Recalling your dreams daily leads to overall improvement in the dream memory and perception.  Later you will be able to get more out of the dream experience or even learn to recognise the dream and change it (lucid dreaming) ✨
Dream analyst here, the bed is a actually a metaphor for the working class
Dang, ur alpha breath stinks Kurtis.
I'd love to see more of this style of content!
I tried the alpha breathing and it freaked my cat out so much
The most important thing you have to do to become a billionaire is talk like you have never experienced emotion
26:52 me with my son worrying whataimadooo
I love bad years they are fun
what’s the song at 22:48 ?? edit: I found it, it's "Freaky" by ihaksi
i need a house tourrr
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Who waits 2+ hours to do all that shit right after waking and not eat breakfast...?
I wish we had Hello Fresh in Brazil lmao
billionaires don’t have to overcome things daily like staying out of the ever present threat of poverty so they create obstacles for themselves like brain smoothies
4:25 man, what do you mean? That dream clearly means you're worried about your health and eating well. You literally just said you drink too much coffee. Eating worms = bad for your gut. Eating bad food and drink = bad for your gut. Worms = bad food and drink  Just saying, that's an easy interpretation.
PLEASE make more content like this
is this man wearing an afffirmations shirt
Why are there so many lockdowns?  You know Umami, Kurtis?  He makes amazing animations. You should check out his stuff.  He recently made an animation about the lock down.  Kind of scary.
Fake, he didn’t evade taxes
Please keep roasting billionaires like this. It gives me life.
the really funny think abt anti-coffee ppl is coffee has antioxidants. like there are good reasons to drink coffee. unless you have a sensitivity to caffeine or smth.
That’s a nice shower
it's scary how good your quality is.
kurtis really is the only man
"because i feel like we are like we are a lot of who we are is our states and emotions" -billionare guy
Who gets apples at Panera?! Always choose the bread!
comrade kurtis
not to sound like a kiss ass but as long as you are making a video you enjoy creating, I will want to watch it!!!! you always make me laugh <3
Can women do the alpha breathing?
i want a half hour video of kurtis just making fun of rich people also his alpha breath stinks
this is my new favourite video ever thank youuuu
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
From the little dance moves for your 2 minutes of movement to “I’m a little cuck” had me absolutely dying. Thank you kurtis, great job on the video.
"Yeah I'm body shaming. What?"
PLEASEEE WHERE DID HE FIND THAT PICTURE OF MARK ZUCKERBERG I CAN'TTT
Please do the movie Ratatoing. And baby geniuses 3
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Why do you think it's okay to just remind us of Cedric's death with no warning whatsoever
Your videos are always so entertaining! So glad I found your channel last year 🥺
The ads that the YouTube algorithm put on this video are horrific. Boss babe men talking about investing
I love your content kurtis I was having a bad day and seen you posted I feel better it felt good to laugh.
Bingo Hall of Fame is now my description for billionaires, politicians, the pub down the road, my DMs and my Law School lecturer roll
Kurtis BASED af, comrades
26:20
This video was awesome
Billionaires are the only people who have time for this shit, don't have to wake up at 4 in the morning and get ready to go to work in 30 mins
22:35 Sims 4
22:26 foreshadowing?
Ok when you said "buy buy buy" I was super disappointed that you didn't use the *NSYNC song. I thought you were better than that 😔  /s (probably didn't do that bc copyright)
Net worth ≠ liquidity, there’s also a lot more white people in America that’s why there are more rich white people 57.8% , 14% are black Americans stating this fact doesn’t mean I’m pro billionaire or racist hell no
I feel like you could make it a monthly series, takes more than a week to change a bit, also you walk the dog in the morning, you already moved your body and you could meditate while walking, i love your shower tho, you could find some better routines out there that arent that vague, i could listen to you complain about billionaire all day bro, recall your dreams and write them help having lucid dreams, what music you sang ? I liked it
that breathing.....
Dreams arent at all your subconscious fixing things lol they are just memories from the day mixed in with subconscious feelings and memories
16:00 awesome shirt
I would actually love to see Kurtis try out different morning routines and review them!
I really love the plants in your house it looks so homey
I can't wait to start my Kurtis Conner morning routine!
I spy with my little eye, afffirmations merch
Ok but the Thomas the tank engine theme is fire tho
1:46
Ewwww dude did you just admit to sleeping in the same bed as a girl, GROSS!
The "1 Billion Dollar Morning Routine" is from a guy whose net worth is...2 million dollars...
grumpy morning kurtis is the best
What if you have to go to work?
my morning routine: wake up go back to sleep wake up scroll through phone take prescription medications (occassionally forgetting to) go to the bathroom, brush teeth get dressed style hair lay back down and scroll through phone go to school
If I have to do that routine every morning in order to be a billionaire I would be unemployed from being fired from my job for being constantly late for work. This billionaire advice is meant for other billionaires.
Hear me out, cold showers are a 10/10 if you’re having a sensory overload
I rewatched the Amazing Spider-Man over the weekend and my girlfriend was like "Dr Curtis Connors? That's like your Youtube friend!"
i think the long stare into the camera after "yes i am body shaming." is my favorite clip from kurtis pls
Please do make a video just making fun of rich old guys
the inflation of his eye 😭😭😭
ITS ABOUT DRIVE 😤 ITS ABOUT POWER 🔥 WE STAY HUNGRY😈 WE DEVOUR 👹 PUT IN THE WORK 💪 PUT IN THE HOURS ⌚ AND TAKE WHATS OURS🥶
Can we get an isolated loop of the 2-minute body movement clips
Holy shit dude your kitchen is gorgeous
Flight got delayed. Time to fly to Kurtistown.
this video had me cackling multiple times
Please make this a series
"spinadge"
Damn your alpha breath stinks
a dream about your doctor being mad about the worms is exactly the type of insane dreams i have every night. so much more human than whatever the guy in the video was talking about
Imagine warren buffet doing any of this stuff? Lol. Something tells me billionaires don’t actually do this stuff.
I just got covid and I'm locked up for a week so I CANT EXPRESS MY HAPPINESS FOR THIS VIDEO ENOUGH <333333 kurtis u r the man luv u
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Thomas the tank song has me crying 🤣😭🤣😭💯
Try Fasting for 72 hrs that will kick your ass.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
dang ur alpha breath stinks🤨
11:26 "im gonna go back to bed after all this shit" KURTIS LMFAO!!!!
“To be or not to be list”  *hamlet quakes*
Kurtis‘ beard is just 2 dachshund kissing
Dang ur alpha breath stinks 🤢
So being a billionaire is doing crazy stuff
Fuuuuuuuuuuck I can’t believe how much I love your mullet 😭 I am literally obsessed; it’s getting to the point my boyfriend is annoyed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 “LOOK AT HIS MULLET!” Every video 🤣
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                 ,/.,  /.,                     ,./,/.,                   ,./, /, /.,/ /.,./
GIVE ME AN EXTRA GREETING ISTG!!!!
Is he tryin' to go for the "80's dad" look on purpose or is he just bein' a hipster?
You can achieve what you want, do start believing in your self, Your Soul & Heart has potential to do every impossible possible 😊
I feel compelled to say that for smoothies, use a milk instead of water. Spinchhh is watery. Frozen bananas are a good fruit base bc they are tHICCC.
Kiwi is so cute
Very disappointed we didn’t get a day-by-day breakdown of the week. I would have loved to watch Kurtis suffer through this each day
I'm scared. He's breathing like a snaaake🙃
This channel is starting to feel like a slightly edgier buzzfeed.  Kurtis used to be funny.  Unsubscribed.
Kurtis doesn't have to tell jokes anymore. He could just alpha breathe at the camera for 10 minutes and I'd piss myself laughing thanks
This video was so hilarious holy shit 2022 is gonna be a good year for this channel because this vid had me rolling
Wow, have I dropped through some youtube trap door? You don't strike me as being terribly bright, bless your heart. Especially about politics
My morning routine is simple, I wake up i make the bed and i clean whatever its out of place in my room, prepare the coffe machine, hop in thw shower and then i take my coffee and thats all i need
Don't be shy Kurtis, give us a house tour
my god i have never laughed so much in front of a video
This is gold
hearing kurt man saying he’s taking a cold shower after going out in -20c makes me, in Québec, want to die
Everybody breathes...  Cosmic Brownie sounds pretty good right now, actually; I'm going to get some and heat them up
Cold showers always make me feel great but I hate them so much in the moment😂
u have one of those fancy showers wow
One of the funniest videos I've watched in a while, I laughed so much. Thanks, Kurtis!
Best video yet. On point every second 😂
If he can live like that so can we some day
why did i think he meant jenna marbles when he said jenna
As someone with a left eye bigger than my right eye, eye feel targeted.
as someone who works at a smoothie shop, i can say without a doubt that people order that exact smoothie and worse everyday <3 we truly live in a society.
Umm.....I don't know how to tell you but i'll try to do it in the most sincere way possible.........Uh...You have something hanging out of your nose.
i’m on 3% holy shit
Video on second channel of kurtis just making fun of billionaires
I think these deep dive style videos are becoming my favorite from you. This and the “Disney Adults” one are videos I revisit/ will revisit often
Just because he has money doesn’t mean he’s not human who feels emotion…
Wait you people dream, I just see a dark void, is that normal
#TrUepublic!   FYI Baby Doge. Get in while its low. 200+ gain in last 30 days. 💯🔥 Also Safemoon for the long run.
I did this routine and now I pee and sh*t diamonds.
I have a really long routine like this, and if I miss it I don’t get anything done. It’s a weird comfort thing for me. I don’t think everyone needs something like that though, but I do think having a really structured morning helps with my anxiety and depression. Might be bullshit but I think it’s something worth trying.
Warren Buffett more like Warren Buffet
that parody billionaire routine and at the end rlly made me laugh ty kurtis
Black ops zombie noises
Hello kurtis you aee good 9:
I love the new lighting
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
comrade curtis
im sorry i love you kurt but these billionaires make me cringe so hard i had to click off
i would love a full video of kurtis just body shaming billionaires
loved this vid Kurtis
now i have supplements in my ad feed lol
18:57 it was at this point when I (who was struggling with a hangover) got so nauseous by his description that I attempted to run to the bathroom to throw up. Unfortunately I did not make it and instead, projectile vomited my mushroom soup all over my hallway
More videos like this PLEASE
like tf i have severe parasomnia. i hate sleeping because my brain keeps coming up with the weirdest and scariest scenarios. Like jeff srry im not gonna make money by recalling those fked up dreams lol
moved around to walk the dog and then moved around again. That's why he isn't a billionaire yet, he moved too much.
its 2022 shave the mustache
Go off KING
Man i wish hello fresh in my country, i just ate seven spoonfuls of peanut butter for lunch and called it a meal
The lazy eye punch was a miss. I think it's the only redeemable quality Jeff bezos has that makes him seem slightly human.
me (an empath) sensing that Kurtis didn't like the smoothie
Smart 🤓
dang ur alpha breath stinks lol
KURTIS.. THE PROBIOTICS!
Wash Happy 2022  🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️
Taking cold showers in the morning is a warm climate thing. You can’t make me shower cold when I have to get out in the snow in the morning. That’s illegal.
Comrade Kurtis >>>>>>> Boot licker Cody Ko
All I'm learning is that billionaires have too much time and actually do zero work so they have to fill it with Alpha breathing
I used to drink lots of coffee like OP and felt tired all the time - this means you're addicted to coffee. If you try to stop you will get flu like side effects so either way you are fkd. If you want to break this habit you should try slowly drinking less caffeine (decaf/tea) over a long period of time.  On the shower part, I used to work out, sleep, and eat a lot and cold shower felt great (you need to ease into it by starting with a warm shower). However, these days I don't have enough time to workout, eat, and sleep so cold showers actually feel painful.  Great video!
The true billion dollar routine had me in Tears
Cold showers are only acceptable if you're overheating and/or it's super hot temperatures cuz that shit warrents it 100%
that alpha beathing cracked me up😂
I'm going to cry, youtube unsubscribed me from this almighty channel
Is that Jim kwik
Did you know you’re naked after the lizard in spider man 🥰
something I find interesting is that a lot of these habits have been borrowed(?) from buddhism/other eastern practices, and their original intentions are more along the lines of" being well so you're able to help your community" and helping you live a more whole, balanced life. and then these guys come along and turn them into some way to win at capitalism. what's supposed to allow you to be of service to others and live a full life is being contorted to help people's greed. there's nothing inherently bad about wanting to wake up early, meditate, journal, read, etc, because those practices can be very helpful in maintaining peace of mind, but the intention of using them to increase your own capital beyond what's necessary, is really really sad.
It's 11:03 am. Today I had coffee a Reece's peices two bites of Snickers and then hot Cheetos 🙁
You dissing these billionaires felt like taking a grinning sip straight from my 90 cent carton of gas station wine with my pinkie straight in the air. A bit of deluxe for the miserable, you could say.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Oh boy how I love Hello Fresh!!
I still want my extra greeting back
I have to admit, you look a lot... fresher...if that makes sense.  Even with your hair😜
Still thinking about how he never said “brush my teeth” during the morning routine😀
I mean… no skincare, no brushing teeth but BREATHE??? I’m almost sure they dont ever use suncream or anything…  Also “be a clean boy”… i fucking lost it there sooo “funny ✔️” Oh and recalling your dreams is not pointless. The more you do that, and writing them, you can get better at recalling it. And it helps in therapy a lot! And some studies say it makes your emotional regulation a lot more stable 🤷🏻‍♀️
Omg Kurt boys trending 👏👏👏
My morning routine is sleeping through  my 5 different alarms, waking up in a panic because I slept through my 5 different alarms, throwing on clothes while simultaneously brushing my teeth, grabbing a granola bar and then speeding off to work where I will take my first piss of the day as I did not have time to do so at home because of,  you guessed it, sleeping through my 5 different alarms 😌
Everytime kurtis says the years going to be different it gets worse😂😂
god i drink smoothies like that a lot during warm weather but i use vanillla oat milk instead of water, and bananas instead of the avocado. tastes really good that way actually! but then again, i'm not a billionaire so,
if youll notice, hes able to afford an apartment with a kitchen that nice in toronto so i think the sigma grindset worked
meaning is based on intent, my friend
Your mustache is distracting 😂 I keep looking at how the middle of it is thicker than the rest
Maybe tomorrow you'll put more water or ice in your smoothie you animal
Nobody said that a Billionaire morning routine is easy...
these guys spend all day just preparing for the day
Your house plants are lovely!
I hope 105k worms isn’t too much Really don’t want your doctor to be mad
That alpha breathing is terrifying holly shit
I’m telling y’all if we eat one and only one billionaire the rest would fall too…  Just sayin’!
your mullet is looking strong king
You have the same Brita filter pitcher as me.
Hey Kurtis, I’ve been a citizen of kurtis town for years now, and I just want to say I really appreciate your videos and your humor. I also am good at dream interpretation, I don’t want to directly address what those dreams mean in the comments, but I just want to say that your feelings are worth acknowledging, not controlling them. I feel for you man, know that there’s lots of love for you on here but also you have people in your personal life that care for you. Just want to spread some kindness to my favorite YouTuber. I hope you’re doing good, take care of yourself first.  (I sound corny I know 😂, but your struggles are worth exploring within yourself). Any ways, your videos are masterpieces and I hope to someday see your standup in person. Have a wonderful day my guy 🙏🏼😁🤙🏼
there's no way billionaires are alone with their conscience for that long every morning
Kurtis I’ve been a huge fan for awhile, but you saying “fuck Suduko” is my last straw. Really sorry that our friendship has to end here however I cannot support someone who believes in such.. good luck with your life🙏🏼
Where can I get that Kurtistown mug?  I LOVE IT
The intro was intense
I'm wondering..... people in impoverished areas that don't have access to hot water ..... are they actually billionaires in training?
dang ur alpha breath stinks
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.
so good kurty boy!!!
I think the best way is to do a cool shower.....with some hot water but so it's like a pool water temperature.
i miss my extra greeting
How in the f*ck is Jenna sleeping facing the window in full daylight? I could never lol
😨
let me just say i love the home decor and plants so whoever has the green thumb.. hats off to you!! so prettyyyyy
You really should have put "learn to write" on your to-do list, that handwriting is incomprehensible
I've heard cold showers can help people with ADHD stay calm anf focused. Though I have never tried it because the discomfort doesn't seem worth it.
Why does the first video he watches remind me of Gary V crying in the shower to motivate himself?
Thats alot of worms
in conclu-IN CONCLUSION
Add pineapple to the smoothie and peanut butter next time 😢 But yea, these are good practices. You don't need to do the breathing if you're already meditating.  But I do: wake up, drink water, pray/meditate, check to do list (made from day before), 7min hula hoop or yoga (while my breakfast is warming), pack lunch and breakfast for work, sit and study until time to leave.  When I'm back from work, I journal for the day and next day.  Study, Exercise, skin and teeth care, review schedule for tomorrow, sleep...
The mustache is getting darker I like it
Why are there so many bots in the comment sections in Kurtis's videos 💀
It's sad that there are "people" who don't bring their stupidity and stinginess in front of the camera. Use me as dislike button.
The real secret to becoming a billionaire: never pay taxes and cry to the government for a handout whenever your investments don't work out. 👍
your dream meant you f*king hate hotel beds
Finally, another video! 😂😂
D…D…. Dr Disrespect !?  Is that you ?! 🤭
Now I can’t wait to see someone do his billion dollar morning routine.
Cool :D
i wake up in the afternoon
dang ur alpha breath stinks
cant find a flight home😂
Canada Eh
CEO Entrepreneur Very funny and a mayor  Kurtis Kurtis Conner
Lol I love how Kurtis completely misunderstood the 'recall your dreams' concept. I think it really means recall your dreams in life, not the previous night's 😂
Is it just me or does this guy look like that dude from Ted?
How about living Like Yahusha for a week? Because I will tell you with zero doubts that if you live like the billionaires you will die like them and suffer like them when judgement comes.
omg kurtis has eaten like more than 100.000 worms by now, keep it going
My morning ritual is to hit the snooze button and I'm doing just fine in life.
I work at 430am, shower and caffeine is  all thats going to happen, when I wake up before 4am
I just can’t help but imagine this dude laying in bed with a pink poof pen and writing this stuff down while swinging his feet in the air like a teenage girl in an early 2000’s teen movie and dotting his i’s with hearts.
I like listing my dreams as its funny, pointless but makes me feel better like your videos :D
That bit about breathing threw my breath outta wack lol
A little unknown fact but once someone has over a billion dollars you are legally allowed to shame them for everything including their bodies. They’re all lizard people anyway
omg what a great video i was doing my makeup and i was actually struggling cause was audibly giggling so often
You ha ve the sane show-room as mi gf!!!!!!
This guy is a Moron. Nothing there. He rant about the money elite when he is part of the social media elite. This guy have serious introspection to do
Those "Billionaires" videos are just trash ads, but it's so funny.
i had to skip the alpha breathing part to weird to watch JADJASJJ srry ily kurtis
imagine being so rich, that one part of your morning-routine is fucking BREATHING in two different ways and thinking about excellence and ambition.
Holy shit Kurtis’ shower looks amazing
this was so great
if you dont like alpha/beta/sigma breathing, try breathing gym! seems more like your vibe kurt ❤❤ enjoy ur day mr. mayor
Kurtis being like imagine you work at McDonald's. Me watching this on break at my McDonald's job. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Note to the Alpha breathing guy: thats going to weaken your lungs, just so you know.
"i don't know what this guy looks like" probably like an avocado face-f*cked a topographical map of utah by the sounds of it
Bump
thee camera quality>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The billionaire morning requires like 2 hours. Every time I've met someone that does these things their solution to me saying "I don't have time for all of that in the morning" is "well just wake up earlier!" Like dude, I work my job, do my thesis work, try to do chores, and then sleep for 8 hours if I'm lucky! If I wake up earlier I'm not going to get nearly enough sleep. Billionaires get to come home and NOT work, which makes it a lot easier to make time for this crap.
It does seem over the top what he does, but at the same  time I think SOME of these things do really look out for your mental and physical well being.  It’s the little things you do for yourself that can impact your mood.
My cat’s name is Kiwi 🥺
Wholeheartedly hate the billionaire mindset but I do the cold showers sometimes and swimming in cold water and it is such an amazing feeling as is so good for you
Nice Majora‘s Mask reference there 👌🏻
I tried watching this while going to sleep on my TV so many jump scares (I was half asleep lol)
react to the cats movie!!!!!!!
That's a great video
Tonight i dreamt i met the pope
No offence to alpha breathing guy but he talks like a sex offender
https://youtu.be/aGYtcoeD_5A
U need to live like Musk. A trillionaire...Elon
Not me vomiting watching him pour the smoothie
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Does anyone think that breathing guy is literally the same dude who owns Bash in Dont Look Up?
impressive. very nice. let’s see paul allen’s billionaire routine
dqang ur alpha breathe srtinks! 😵
When Curtis just put a dash of water in his smoothie and thought it would liquify...
I love spider-man
Hey Krutis, MONEY PLEASEEEE! (day 3 of asking you for money pleaseee)
"You're allowed to body shame a billionaire." Words to live by
I mean this in the least creepy way possible... i hope. but i really enjoyed seeing parts of their house. very aspirational
After doing Kurtis's routine, I entered a deep coma in which I became a billionaire. Thanks Kurtis!
That mullet tho!! 🤘
If you waxed a thin outline around your whole mustache you’d have a slightly smaller mustache and it would look funny I think
Your videos bring me so much joy, thank you kurtis :)
If you do all that shit in the morning everyday youre a sociopath ngl. If all billionaires do that stuff then I'd rather stay poor lmao  Okay, jokes aside, some of these things are actually good to your mental health and have been recommended to me by my therapist: drinking water; meditating and focusing on breathing is good for your brain (I dont remember exactly what for but I've done some research on that topic for a college paper, maybe I should meditate more lol); moving your body, especially if youre a couch potato like me, is definitely a good thing to do- exercising is vital to your mental health; cold showers - especially in the morning- have their benefits like waking you up and making you feel more energized; the to-do list is good for keeping you organized and setting your priorities for the day - and it doesnt need to be big things, it could be like watering your plants or walking the dog- also checking things off a list releases dopamine and makes you feel productive
Just saw that Kurt is trending👏🏻👏🏻
kurtis's videos are the opposite of the alt right pipeline. you come for a few funny reaction videos and BOOM! COMMUNISM!
Headspace is just f*cking great. 🤷‍♂️
😲😲
This is literally just a self-care Twitter thread 😭😭😭
“Bingo Hall of Fame” is the most accurate description of these billionaires EVER
"Thinking about water, thinking about oxygen" - Zuck, probably
A billionaire saying "Then what I do is I do my breathing" is the most unintentionally hilarious shit 😭😭😭
Why was this vid so damn funny hahahah
Why’d he call it spinage? What is he, a DJ?
The thing about morning routines is that they should be what *you* need, and ideally would be built up and perfected over time. Trying to copy someone else's to a T will always lead to failure
Didn't expect a mention of the I love College guy and I'm not mad 💕
why do i feel like this one has pinned comment potential
Someone gave you a billion dollars for a day?
How to be a billionaire  Do morning routine  5pm: it’s time to get to work! 6pm: time to get off work! We aren’t human doings, we’re human beings, gotta be about that work life balance!
spinej
I want your house, it's so nice
Didn't realise kurtis was based af
20 minute meditation is way to long to begin with. Like begin with 5 minutes, and just do that for a while. I'm serverly mentally ill and making room for meditation is really difficult but it is really nice every time I do it. So the 5 minute mark is amazing for me!!
Yh
dang ur alpha breath stinks
20:19 lmao is that Jacob😭💀
Jesus fucking christ Kurtis, I was prepared for a chuckle or even a sprinkle of guffaws.. but I wasn't prepared to get straight bodied by the goddamn "anti-billionaire morning routine". Thanks for being too funny you attempted fucking murderer
Kurtis’s shirt is like “be nice to me (but not billionaires, shove them into lockers)”
kinda upset that Kurtis didnt say "so Kiwi can take a wee-wee," but its FINE its WHATEVER it doesnt even matter I GUESS
https://youtu.be/6pbA239I9sw
I don't know about you, Kurtis, but my bed doesn't start to literally rot if I don't make it.
why u so jelly tho
Kurtis. Get a haircut. Please. I'm begging you.
i like cold showers every now and then but everyday sounds like torture
having a cold shower is good for circulation etc but i think you're meant to do it after having a warm shower and gradually turn the heat down not just step into cold water coz it shocks ur body n feels horrible
Your completely incomprehensible sentence after drinking the tea and then “ya know?” made me laugh so hard, thank you!
Apple at Panera slander was so uncalled for buddy
Let's talk about the fact that reading is pretty expensive and you can't become a billionaire if you keep spending money  conclusion: don't eat, don't drink, don't read, don't shower, SAVE THAT MONEY
certified proletariat
"to feel list" ofc they got a to feel list all billionaires are apathetic exploitative sociopaths Why else would they need a list to REMIND them to feel human emotions
When Kurtis drank the brain smoothie I think that's the saddest I've ever seen him
Kurtis is now obligated to create a video making fun of billionaires, if not there will be consequences.     That was not a threat.   That was a statement.
you drinking brain smoothies? bottoms up and the billionaire devil laughs
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Kurtis Conner? I hardly know her.
this video is so good Kurtis!! I loved the billionaire rant & was so excited to hear that you enjoyed meditation. 20 minutes for the first time is pretty damn long. I want to encourage you to keep it up, it has helped many different aspects of my life. (Insight timer is another great app for that btw)   also, thank you for putting out videos and pods so regularly! happy new year
Did you have a cold shower?
The "alpha breathing" is like the face that the evil CEO in the movie "don't look up" always have🤣🤣
No offence, but it looks like he has 2 moustaches
what's it like to have dreams that aren't about you getting ridiculed, insulted, shamed and left by all your friends?
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Damn I love Conner but it’s sad to see the hypocrisy just cause someone has money. People get so cold when they see someone super successful
Billionaires saying copying their ‘mindset’ or morning routine will make you a billionaire too  is the same as supermodels saying using their skin care routine will make you look like them
Plot twist the secret to their wealth is never paying hot water bills
I'm having a panic attack and your voice helped me calm the F down and actually got me to laugh. I can breathe. Thank you Kurtis.
love the video danny keep it up
Kurtis, you've hit the peak of human existence, you were shown in a jacksepticeye video. (It's the newest video on tiktok he made for anyone who's wondering which video he's in)
Best episode!
next time my boss tells me to work faster i'll just say "we're not human doings, we're human beings" and i'm sure i'll immediately get promoted to president
I like that I lost it at the exact same moment as Kurtis when they said "and then I do my breathing"
Last night I dreamt that some murderous woman was using my toothbrush while making strong, angry eye contact. Not sure what my subconscious is trynna tell me there 🤷‍♀️
Especially fuck cold showers with it being like 20 degrees in Las Vegas with No Heater.
kurtis i just wanted you to know my mom said she really likes your moustache
4:15 ok but I’m pretty sure most people’s dreams are super weird so I doubt they’re gonna help anyone become a millionaire… the other day I dreamt that I was at a store and met Pegasus and apparently I took a selfie with him but then just….left my iPad with him for some reason and left, then, after an embarrassingly long time, I remembered that I left my iPad at the store and was just like “ughhh the store is so far away and idk where that store is but ik it’s far away and my parents are gone for some reason” so then I decided to run around aimlessly, looking for the store, and then I saw my sister, who had also been missing. And then I woke up…
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Dream recalling is really good for lucid dreaming which can be super helpful (and also super fun…or scary) :)
Kurtis your handwriting I can't
Your smoothie looks like your shirt KURTIS love it!!!!! <3
Kurtis' creepy smile is going to haunt me forever
ok i have somewhere to be my 11am and its 5am currently i hope these 30 minutes are worth it
almost pissed myself watching this
I just knew you were going to fart haha
that was hilarious omg
"You allowed to bodyshame a billionaire"  Sound a lot like the people that misgender the trans people they dont like😶
The "Alpha Breather" looks like he's constipated. I tried it and looked in the mirror and I look like a guy who wasn't ready to get his pic taking....as if somebody snapped a pic in the middle of me smiling for it. Anyone who takes cold showers in the morning may be low-key psychotic
I do get the apple at Panera 🙈
I’m in med school and I chipped my way here (and I’m also 300K in debt because of it)
That stash is a bit nasty
Cold showers are actually good for our bodies for a bunch of reasons. Waking you up is more just a shock effect rather than one of the real health benefits.  I love your videos though and I too hate cold showers lol
My sister said you look like Captain Hook
I take a tall glass of water take pills and do my breathing 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
“Oh they already made a Cats movie? I gotta watch that”  No, Kurtis, you don’t.
I watched 16:02 about 20 times. Thank you for leaving in that delightful goof for my enjoyment
I want a video of Kurtis making fun of billionaires for one hour straight
Woh congrats on #9
Based Kurtis "Comrade" Conner
When you're using a shotgun mic you need to hold it further away from your face than a normal stage mic. The part where you were wearing a lav idk what was wrong but it sounded stuffy. Also you're fucking hilarious I was dying laughing so much. Keep up the good work man
This video had me laughing out loud to myself several times. I also really enjoyed seeing part of Kurtis and Jenna’s house and seeing a vlog style video from him, even if it was sarcastic and just to point out billionaire bullshit. His mullet is also growing out nicely.
the dreams kinda sound like maybe he’s a bit too hard on himself and missing home lately. idk tho that’s just what I got from it.
When kurtis does that over saturated edit thing he looks like he’s in a 70’s self help video
Just fuckin do what Patrick Bateman did dude
So just do nothing all morning while thinking you're being productive? Man the cringe almost kills me every time I see these routines 😂
if you need to remember to feel doesn’t that just mean you’re a psychopath like huh
Living in Australia and it currently being summer I have to admit I’m loving a good old cold shower
As someone who actually drinks smoothies on a semi regular basis, greens are a fine additive—you really don’t taste them if the smoothie is made decently, they just make your smoothie look uglier while adding some positive nutritional benefits. But you need a better base for it to not taste like crap imo. I usually do a couple frozen fruits (blueberry or other berries, mango is good, I really like adding frozen pineapple or peaches) or fresh fruits if I have them (banana is popular since it’s cheap and sweet, but I’m allergic), some Greek yogurt (I usually use vanilla Greek yogurt since I can’t have banana, so it adds some sweetness), and a liquid. I will sometimes use water or a water and juice mixture since I’ve already added sweetened yogurt, but if I have it, I’ll use a splash of oat milk or almond milk. I’ll sometimes add some flaxseed oil or chia seeds but it’s really dependent on how my diet has been.   As for greens, I usually use spinach or kale. Arugula is peppery and I’m not a fan, so I’m a little worried about adding it to a smoothie, but there are other more neutral greens you can add if you don’t have spinach or kale. Don’t go overboard with raw spinach since it can have some negative effects if you eat a ton of it every day, but 99.9% of people are not going to run into that issue lol.
THE CEDRIC CLIP OMG
I will say meditation is SUPER good! My therapist has me do it to help with my PTSD and it does wonders! I HIGHLY recommend it!
Love videos of you doing your thing in your beautiful Jenna-curated house ☺️ I’m wondering, have you ever played Project Zomboid? It’s totally impossible at first but I’d love to see you play it!
All those billionaires that you called "old white people" are actually jewish. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
look out it's comment number 2 KURTIS WHere did you guys get those hanging masks 22:51 ??? I need to know
I'm about halfway through they video and I predict that Kurtis won't be a billionaire by the end of it - he forgot to take the supplements. Also your supposed to journal and IN ADDITION make those three lists...because you're "writing already". Kurtis, you will never be a billionaire with that attention span.
These guys are definitely fucking lying
Idk what y’all say but kurtis was at his funniest in this video 😭😭😭
having gender envy from your mullet and mostache 😭🙏
I've never heard of a "to-feel" and a "to-be" list until now.
YO KURTIS’S SHOWER IS ACTUALLY DOPE WTF
The 2020 2 joke isn't just funny.  It is a prediction- nay! A prophecy!
"socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires." - my boy steinbeck
Comrade connor
I do less in a week that this guy does in one morning.
Beta breathing took me out 💀
Wow...I calculated this daily "self care" regimen before work at 2 hours perfectly.  They just combined like every single self care habit together and called that their day-to-day morning routine. Yeah...no way does anyone with a regular job have time for this. I'm not a morning person and work from home. I don't even have time for breakfast. I roll over 30-60min before my shift starts. Some of those methods weren't even useful. Thinking about your dreams sometimes doesn't provide a deep meaning. The 3 thoughts lists again can be done in your head.
As a person with very little energy to use each day due to a bunch of mental bullshit, this whole list is basically a whole weeks planning for me, and he does this each morning?! Wtf?!?
All my breathing is alpha breathing 🤢🤮
I despise billionaires. I've only had two fastfood jobs and I'm already tired of the stupid capitalist lie that hard work will get me where they are. Work is misery to me. It's hours spent feeling anxious and scared of making mistakes and dealing with shitty customers. I get anxious from the beeping and alarms in kitchens but I just have to deal with that because I can't live via my art
where was our extra greeting? ):
“ooooh i’m a little cuck” 😭😭😭
Love how full your mullet is getting 💀
People take cold showers because they don't live in Canada.
I’ve been doing your morning routine since yesterday and I feel so much better, my mom says she wants to disown me now but I don’t care, your routine is the best! 🥰
am i the only person that doesnt understand the appeal of these type of youtubers?
The amount of bullshit in one Video is insane
One can diss the Cult of the Billionaire and still see this is some negative-ass-nancy shit right here. Study after study shows that pro-active morning/daily routine is all-but necessary to being a high-performance individual--not a Billionaire or even a Millionaire, but toward achieving some of the goals others find difficult if not impossible to achieve.  But, sure, whatever dude.
dude wtf i cant even be a billionaire because my adhd would never let me do this morning routine 😥😩 /lh /hj no but seriously im getting distracted just listening to this guy talk, kurtis is the only thing keeping me going lol
Ok can someone tell me why BBIG is  about to squeeze to 20$ next week and no one is talking about it???? 🙄
Subscribed 💫💗 officially a citizen of Kurtistown
Making fun of old rich white people.. yeah thats new on the internet
For an atheist you do say jesus a lot Jesus more like sus
Marx is copying kurtis' notes
uuuhhh more videos like this. not a request but a threat btw
What the billionaire didn't mention about his tea is that, because it has mct oil in it, for the first week or so you will just be pooping constantly. Maybe that's the key to being rich - you've got to poop out all the poor person energy first.
Him : We're not human doings Also him: *continues making a to do list*
These videos save my day
I AM DRUNK
Can we please get a video of you exclusively making fun of billionaires
Pissing the bed means fuck the system
More videos like this ples
“And yes I AM body shamming….🤷🏻🤨 what. Are you gonna stand up for JEFF BEZOS”
I read the title as “I Lived Like a Billboard for a Day”
Kurtis...you just needed to add ice to the smoothie😂😩 watching you drink that was terrifying
Ok but his version of the routine had me dyinggggg
Loved this video
sir wtf is going on with that facial hair 😭
oh god the way kurtis opened the bag of spinach with the knife nearly gave me a heart attack 😭
Jesus you dont have to go THAT hard on billionares wow lol
I giggled a little at Kurtis’ hair when he got out of the shower.
holy shit kurtis conner based moments
lol my morning routine is to get woken up by 14 consecutive alarms, FULLY AWARE I am going to lean over and turn them all off and then go to class 20 minutes before I'm supposed to, get a coffee on the way there before i'm Actually late (or i walk out during lecture and get a coffee from the vending machine), and the ritual begins anew fresh next morning. Highly recommended billionaire tactic.
I love how smoothly he introduced sponsors
your best work dude!
Please make a video of just pure hate jokes about rich old white people
I'm offended Kurtis, my GF asked "what is alpha breathing" and I replied with "you wouldn't understand you are a beta breather", then 5 seconds later you stole my joke. Where is my twitter apology
This is the most i've enjoyed a youtube video in a long time
THE BREATHING CLIP HAS ME IN TEARS
God bless everyone     💝
I haven't laughed OUT LOUD at a yt video in soooo long and this had me GOING I was so annoying!
this has been my favorite kurtis video in awhile. i laughed out loud so many times
BABY 8 ON TRENDING!!!!!
BABY!!!!!!
Go off king
excuse me did you just say...fuck sudoku? #kurtisconnerisoverparty2022
Step 1 : Be a psychopath Step 2 : Develop a weird routine Step 3 : Exploit peoples labour with no remorse
Yo did he get a better camera??
On the trending page ma boy
The journaling corner is aesthetic af and it could definitely be a YouTube set.
having the ability to pretend to be a billionaire is kinda lit
21:56 this is the cutest thing i’ve ever seen in my life
Kurtis is beyond based
Fax brb
This was fantastic. You're hilarious as always.
11:52 FOUL
My dad takes cold showers sometimes
Dang man, your alpha breathing stinks
There is some evidence that the dream problem solving bit is true to some extent. Probably not the key to “success” though.
The fact that he drinks a night time sleep tea in a morning routine 😂
Dude the breathing is making me WHEEEEEZE
I feel like the routine is a great one for health and self-improvement, but it's completely unrealistic for an average person to accomplish every day. Each of those things could be a single New Years resolution like damn
“Dang ur alpha breath stinks”
I loved this, please more videos like this Kurtis. The real billionaire routine bit killed me!
Nice
Kurtis, you are self-employed, that book applies to you anyway
That's the stupidest morning routine I've ever seen. Imagine wasting 2 hrs everyday doing that! Sure you'd get no work done.   Just get a hot cup of coffee and be on your way... 😏
Watching this w/ breakthrough COVID knowing I'm about to get evicted because I can't work makes me so mad. Thank you for mocking the stupidly-rich, it gives me life.
Kurtistown is NOT CAPITALIST ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
this was so fun i’d love to see more videos like this!
Recalling dreams helps with lucid dreaming
Class consciousness as a treat. Thank you Mr. Mayor
That turd of a human doing definitely doesn’t make his own bed.  Only the rich have this much time. The rest of us do our meditating at work, eyes open, while typing emails, so this guy can make more money.
Your joke morning routine at the end accurately described my morning routine and I don't know how to feel
Ok so now I need someone to try Kurtis’ morning routine and show us the results. I’d do it myself but I am not sure I’d be a big fan of setting my journal on fire while beta breathing
dang ur alpha breath STINKSSSSS
How does anyone remember to anything when you wake up. I feel like I’m not a real person for the first hour I’m awake
kurtis' skin is gorgeous in this video what to heck
Kurtis i swear to FUCKING GOD I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD THAN AT THE REAL BILLIONAIRE MORNING ROUTINE ending with tony hawk fucking stop i am going to pEE MY PANTS
Did I ever tell ya about the time I decided to become a Billionaire? it's was round about January  I followed tha plan  by day 2 I'd made up ta aboot Tree fiddy  it was then, I noticed that the Motivation Video was actually a creature from ......  then I retired
Dang Kurtis ur alpha breath is stinky 😤😩
Congrats on trending
No one wants to say how rj mitte I mean Walter junior, I mean Flynn, I mean the son in breaking bad ???
wow i love how much kurtis’s sweater contradicts his actual values, by that i mean being nice to every except for billionaires
#7 ON TRENDING LETSGOOOOOO
seeing the remaining half of the avocado without the seed on it triggered me 🥑😭
By far the best video i’ve ever seen from you💀 More following people’s stupid tutorials pls this was funny as SHIT
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC_PL9riuzL-1snZxtvROUZA?sub_confirmation=1 j
J
Making ur bed can allow mold to grow bc there’s no ventilation. That’s my excuse.
I didn’t know smoothies could come that brown
can we get a house tour ur interior design is very swag
I’m sorry as a fan from Nebraska but u literally just triggered like Shays Rebellion by making fun of Warren Buffett
BRO YOU’RE SO FUNNY 😆
lol the 80s porn star look!!
WHERES THE EXTRA GREETING?
you didnt become a billionaire bc you didn’t wait to take your first breath sorry
My favorite part has to be kurtiss face when drinking the smoothie 💀
hot take about cold showers: you just have to live in the right place to feel the awesome effects of cold showers. and that means: live in places that the summer is suuuper hot, which i guess canada is not
The alpha breathing had me having to leave the room from laughing so I didn't wake up the baby, and I composed myself and came back in and you farted. And immediately had to leave again because I made this noise out of my nose/throat that even scared me lol. Its my fault. I'm the one who decided to watch this at midnight during mama time. I should have known I wouldn't just be smiling and thinking to myself "that was funny" and instead making weird laughing noises trying to be quiet lol
at this moment i wanna see this guy eat 94k worms for his likes.
Where my extra greeting
Billionaires are NOTHING. The only TRUE way to measure success is through the trending page on youtube
Kurits, your home is incredible!
i hope kurtis knows that chamomile actually helps you to fall asleep better
im tempted to do a mountain dew and brownie smoothie for my morning routine
KURTIS U SHOULD'VE SAID "COLD TAKE" WHEN U WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COLD SHOWER
Honestly, your dream about purposefully peeing in the hotel bed seems very on-the-nose. Like, it's not 100% literal, but it is you taking something that belongs to a wealthy establishment and saying "this is what I think of this"
I knew having you as my mayor for 2+ years was a great choice with the way you said I can body shame billionaires. 😌 Imma even go further and bully anyone making 6+ figures. Don't care. 😼💅🏾
Alpha breathing is the most uncomfortable thing ever wtf
He looks so exhausted after doing it for a week
That breathing bit was literally the worst thing I’ve ever had to listen to omg
Yes and I became a slave of everyone.Good job
Kurtis, it was my favorite video of yours!
I like cold showers ☹️☹️
It's kind of amazing that even with all the brain teas and brain smoothies, he never managed to figure out that superfoods are a lie meant to separate rich idiots like him from their money.
wow Kurtis has beautiful eyes, just saying
A clean boy
Tea slaps and coffee is literally the worst thing I've ever had my god
this was the funniest thing of the 2020's
fuck bro, a shittier cody ko
Kurtis being completely oblivious of his almost constant stress dreams >>>>
11:54 why does he look soo good in this clip ??!
Holy shit I didn't know how utterly based Kurtis is. May the proletariat rise up and eat the rich, comrade Kurtis. seriously makes me trust him so much more.
I could watch Kurtis recall his dreams for literal hours on end
I feel like he got that line "We're not human beings. We're humans doing." from the song "Scatman's World" by Scatman John The line I am referencing is "I wanna be a human being, not a human doing." Cant even come up with his own lines. Billionaires 🙄🙄🙄
https://youtube.com/shorts/cPX014J02Hk?feature=share
9:49 stealing scatman john lyrics
bro did anyone else notice how jacked Kurtis's collar bone looked?! god damn. I literally paused- LMAO
Breathing techniques and cold showers are actually good for you. Totally against making smoothies with water tho.
you should do a video putting your hand in the part where the blades are on a blender that would be cool I think
This video is fucking gold.
Your billion dollar morning routine is kinda like mine and now I think I know why I’m depressed
super high and that breathing skit gave me trauma
Holy cow! You only require 10 minutes of meditation!? That's only half the time of a billionaire! That's like 2x the potential. You're like a double billionaire. That's pretty close to a trillionaire. That’s impressive.
i physically recoiled when he drank the "brain smoothie" 😷 poor kurtis
More kiwi content please I love him
92 thousand worms and counting
did u know u were named after the lizard from spiderman
Can't wait to try Kurtis's morning routine!! I am sure this is the secret to becoming the first trillionaire!!!
radical anti-capitalist politics hidden in comedy youtube
i genuinely do majority of these steps and i am still broke 😭
I know this’ll get buried, but Hello Fresh is super anti-Union and anti-labor and I think it’d be cool if you looked more into how they treat their workers and maybe consider dropping your association with them
kurtis i had a dream last night that i wrote a poem about you that was mean and then you bashed my head in with a baseball bat what does that mean
Where's the extra greeting????
Holy shit you haven't even taken a breath yet? lmaooooo
Hire me for 5k usd per month to be your life coach Kurtis
is no one gonna talk about the spider-man movie interfering with his plane home it’s spider-man no way home
I love Kurtis, but I'm gonna be real with you guys for a moment... I hate rich people complaining about richer people. I mean, maybe Kurtis is not part of the 1% but for many (if not most) people around the world, he can be most certainly considered wealthy. I know there are valid criticisms to be had, but I don't feel like that comes across on most of these types of videos. Most of the time it just feels a bit entitled to me cuz, people that are actually struggling don't have time to whine about this. Anyway, just a thought.
My ex asked me to take a shower with him and I thought it would be sexy… but then he forced me to take a cold shower and wouldn’t shut up about the “benefits”
As a non-native english speaker, when I heard "make my brain smoothie" I interpreted it as "make my brain *smooth* " I laughed so fucking loud on the thought of that "making your brain smooth" is a crucial part of becoming a billionare
You are wearing only one dress, you sleep in one bed, you digest only food, your stomach can take, you shit in one toilet.... And no one really cares how you live, everyone cares only about his own body, psyche needs. It’s all illusion anyway.  Our body and mind is satisfied,when it has no needs.
Keep the hair and the stache Curtis, it makes you look even better if that’s even possible ;)
chamomile is a sleepy time tea kurtis!
The guy in the billionaire video sounds like he’s impersonating Ryan Reynolds and it’s so much funnier because of it
His handwriting looks EXACTLY like my brother's wtf lolllllll
Who did that mourning routing video? Patrick Bateman?
Kurtis, what’s with all the plants?
To be completely honest, most of the things in the morning routine are useless. But  I would definitely recommend doing breathing exercises and meditation and maybe even journaling. also, the drinking water is good. I started doing most of these things before I go to bed and I get some of the best sleep because of it.   Also, Kurtis, stop drinking so much coffee omg lmao
I was gonna try it too but I'm gay so I guess I'm not allow to do the Alpha breathing. Might as well just die.
Billionaires take cold showers bc half of their fortune comes from saving on electricity
Cold showers suck, for sure,  but I've found them to actually be really helpful for my depression personally :)
Mr. Conner, just thought i'd let you know that you are in Jackscepticeyes latest video!
the kurtis i knrw was a big capitalist.., i think thi s  one may be a skinwalkker .
Cats the movie the sequel~
If you have a couple billion dollars you have probably killed someone
Took damn near 8 years for that smoothie to get to your mouth 👄
Forgot to add ice to those smoothies
bro that is so not billionaire of you to have a beautiful girlfriend who actually loves you… you just not cut out
the word : spinach  the way kurtis says it : spindage
Patent your morning routine for Gamers. Maybe add steps like splashing water on your pits for “deodorant”
KURTIS WITH THE MIYAGI DO BONSAI IN UR ROOM I SEE YOU I SEE YOU
The fact that in Kurtis' mind, the opposite of meditation is listening to the Thomas the tank engine theme song at full blast while thinking about your mistakes is so freaking funny to me for some reason. When that bit happened, I laughed so hard I almost puked up my brain smoothie.
Mama is starting to look like Lionel Richie
I love this haircut
I live in Toronto. I swear to God, I saw you and your gf at sherway a few weeks ago. I wasn't sure though because so many people look like you so please tell me, did i miss my chance for a pic???
I dreamt that my sister killed my mom and me and baked us into pie and was going to frame my mom for our murder, so I don't know what that's trying to fix
Finally someone who shares my hatred for cold showers
the deadric scene came out of nowhere and i've been laughing about it for 20 minutes
During the Alpha breathing I thought Kurtis was laughing at it because he was smiling & making noises, then I realized he was doing the breathing technique😂
actually with the breathing i’ve tried a different exercise he mentioned, box breathing for like choral warm ups, and even just for two minutes it’s really nice to do to at least calm down or relax
That morning routine at the end just blessed 2022
I officially have to dislike 👎 because It’s one of the ones that doesn’t play on my TV via the Lightning to HDMI adapter. I really liked it despite the intentionally disabling my ability to watch it
Obviously the Billionaire guy doesn’t have an hour commute in the mornings like I do 🥲
Living for the long videos! Also the home decor?!?! Impeccable
love when you try different styles of videos !
i like your mullet
Kurtis alpha breathing will forever haunt my nightmares
The leftist energy in this video is unparalleled. Kurtis has joint us and we will win
You think Ontario is bad? Try being in Quebec 😔
Your dreams are so simple??? Last night I dreamt that I was at a gas station with my father and this girl who was my (later discovered) girlfriend sprayed gasoline on a car and then lit it on fire, which caused an explosion and my dad and I hightailed it out of there.. Thats not even half of it! My dreams also have a specific repeating map/layout to them?! Maybe I'm particularly unusual?
"spinage"
the fucking alpha breathing oh my god
https://youtube.com/channel/UCTKXk9RUrvJTfCo0KOPHS-w
kurtis, i love you. and that's not the margaritas talking.
I must say, buying a vitamix for a billionaire routine video is quite the commitment.
Please do a reaction vid with ur gf 🥺 she’s adorable
looks like kurtis about to eat 89k worms
Wait. I know we are past this and I just started the video so I’m not sure if he said it later in the video but I did not hear an extra greeting
im so sorry you had to drink that smoothie, it looks like a textural nightmare and i would totally throw up
For my last job I had to catch two buses across town to be in for 8, my alarm would go at 5.55 (6am & I'd be late, I had it fine tuned) and I'd barely have time to get ready & out the door.   I cut it down to an absolute bare minimum - no breakfast, no coffee (couldn't afford to buy one either, shitty work coffee saved my life!)  Was miserable but I stuck it out for two years, getting a team leader position only one bus ride away felt like such a great achievement!  Much a billionaire who successfully lobbies congress to ban unions and ignore tax loopholes 🥰
Yeee u
Kurt pissed on something and didn’t even need three ciders and one weed 😱
my first boyfriend pointed out to me that my eyes weren't perfectly symmetrical (among other helpful observations)
im 8 minutes in, why cant a billionaire afford a hot shower? Is that the trick? you save money on heating the water????
loving the kiwi content in this video
Oh, the lies that some rich people sell to their followers 😂😂😂
for people who like kurtis' editing style when he's in the kitchen, you should check out brutalmoose!
Cold showers can be fucking amazing - provided it's the middle of summer and you live somewhere that gets really hot. Otherwise you're just crazy.
Okay but is no one gonna mention how pretty and pleasing to the eyes Jenna and Kurts house is???
2:50 Maybe it’s because there are less black people in America 🤷🏾‍♀️.   How many Mexican billionaires are there? (Hint: the number ain’t that high).
I think what I took from this is that you should start beginning every video with a dream recall 😂 PLEASE...that was hilarious! Also- FYI- billionaires wake up between 3-5AM...so that’s why they have time to do all that shit 😂 but another FYI, it’s also been proven that if you sleep less you actually live longer and your body is healthier..i forget why, but it’s a part of biohacking.
NEVER TAKE COVI 19 VACCINE. I MEAN NEVER.........
I dream about my future a lot..
i think it’s pretty selfish that kiwi doesn’t want you to start your billionaire routine first thing in the morning
This guy's life is like the intro to American Psycho.
You have so many plants! We need a plant tour!
dang ur alpha breath stinks
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GONNA CRY WHEN HE DRANK THE SMOOTHIE HELP?
I don't understand why there needs to be so many steps. Why do we need to do breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, brain games and reading first thing in the morning? There's a lot of overlap there and it can definitely be made more efficient.
Love the Majora's Mask ref 11:40
kurtis and jenna’s interior design is so so stylish
I get an apple from Panera 🖐🏽😓
9:45 Yo, did this guy ACTUALLY Simpsons himself?
Yes more vids like this lmao 😂
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The human doing human being line was better when Scatman John said it
The only excuse for taking a cold shower is being super hot.
Congrats on #1 trending 🎉
My morning routine: 5 alarms set 10 minutes apart (snooze all of them Get out of bed 15 minutes before my shift starts Throw on clothes Fill cat food and water Drive to work
9:47 👏👏👏👏👏
In South Africa we eat some worms called 'Mopaneworms' so maybe there is a chance that one could eat to many worms
6:40 me too man-
11:58 yeah i live near Ontario and it is crazy cold these days smh
I’ve been a professional dream interpreter for 69 years now and peeing on a hotel bed is what is known in the industry as a “mayor’s mullet.” This means the person doing the pissing is a great mayor and their town is thriving and everyone is nice to them. 😴👌
amos diggory clip was not cool :/
As a brit its really bothering me that kurtis is drinking his tea with the bag still in
your videos make me laugh very loud all by myself in my room
I laughed so hard at Kurtis doing the alpha breathing😂😂 his face omg 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah. No. Jeff Bozo has the money to fix his eye. F off,  JEFF
Lol that cold shower and Feel List suggestion had Kurtis rethinking this whole idea
We all need to make an agreement that, once the revolution succeeds, instead of executing the rich, we need to let kurtis locker slide them down a mountain
The breathing instructor sounded like the Elon musk type of guy in “don’t look up”
I love breayhing
🥝!
Lmao forgot you lived in Ontario. Man it kinda sucks here
Kiwi has the billionaire mindset I just know it
Hi Weird Al Yankovich.  Glad to see you back.  You must've gotten contact lenses.  Good look!
Amazing that a poor person like Kurtis finally get to experience joy in life for once
im watching this while eating out of a chinese food to go box and we all know how kurtis feels abt those
when i saw the title of the video i thought Kurtis meant that he was gonna exploit the working class for a week
You’re not wrong but you’re not right either. You hit the nose when you said you NEED to be a billionaire to do these routines, I swear the sh** they detail on mornings alone takes 15 hours to do. BUT you’re being sold genuine self care practices by frauds. Tea, cold showers, and yoga/meditation are ALL good practices but the working class cannot viably practice them all on their 15 hour daily work routines. But if you implicate at least 1 of these into your daily routine you will see the benefits. I don’t claim it’s your responsibility but being in tune with Mother Earth and genuine connectivity to self care and the Motherly Spirit can heal you in many ways. These lucky lads were exposed to all of it because of the silver spoon hanging out their mouths but I plead to you, do not misperceive these practices as untrustworthy just because the men selling them to you are. We all come from the dirt and their is absolutely no shame in that, our Earth loves us very much so she deserves that love back ❤️ may God bless you
I wake up at 4 AM for school everyday and I got to say, I 100% don't need to wake up as early as I do. I fuck around for 33.3% of the 3 hours I have to get ready, but here's what I do normally: 4:00 AM -- I wake up  4:03 AM -- Either I actually went upstairs and am fucking around with my phone while eating breakfast, I went back to bed, or I'm sitting in my bed fucking around with my phone. 4:30 AM -- Eat breakfast, take meds, and make lunch 5:00 AM -- Take a shower: a little below room temp so I wanna spend very little time in it (unless it's like 40 F in LA then it's warm as hell because my fingies are cold) 5:10 AM -- Take 20 minutes to wash teeth, have hair, clean face, and stare at the mirror contemplating my existence 5:30 AM -- Do my makeup  *(yeah it takes about an hour for some goddamn reason it does)* 6:20 AM -- Put all my school shit into my backpack instead of scattered on my desk 6:40 AM -- Read, for school if I need to, fuck around if I don't 7:00 AM -- Seems like I do this shit quicker when I write it out but trust me it takes me until the time I leave to do this. 7:20 AM -- Leave the house for school.
Doofy breathing exercises aside, Kurtis has some gd beautiful teeth.
please make a bonus video that's just making fun of billionaires
I remember when the hot water heater stopped working and like holy shit only taking cold showers for 2 months was living hell I have no idea why rich people love it so much
I love the affirmations shirt
The smoothie he described would actually be good with some honey and yogurt or almond milk added. Maybe some strawberries or acai too. Will it be brown? Maybe. Will it be good? I think so. Not to defend a billionaire.
usually breathing ]which me Mum tells me to do is akin to meditation'. Think deep breathing. So wtf is this alpha breathing and crap?! Obvsiously I didn't know about those breathing types because I was not worthy, nor am I still worthy.... :|
in the morning i wake up 15 minutes before i have to leave. i get dressed, brush teeth, and brush my hair.
That smoothie looked like someone already ate it, at least once
a cold shower doesnt mean put the shower on full cold. if you have a hot shower you dont put the shower on full hot, youd burn yourself.   for me, when i have a cold shower, i get it cold enough to imitate the temperature of a pool. when you get accustomed to that you can make it colder if youd like, but i just find that its super refreshing.
no joking y'all pls take ur vaccines no one wants to spend ANOTHER year in a pandemic
4:51 stop flexing on poor little bencil sharpener kurt
Like an asshole, so just another normal day then? Clearing a high bar over here.
👍
im gonna need the video if you watching cats
Cry about it
2021 was the sequel to 2020, Mr. Konner.
Ya know.....once you OWN the Vitamix.....I'm pretty sure they let you take it out of the box 🤷😁 Next "To Feel" List - I FEEL like taking my Vitamix OUT of the box 🤣
I take a cold shower every single day, ain't even get $00000000 on my bank account.
When did he stop giving us extra greetings :,’(
You got trending congrats kurtis 😀
You better watch your tone, when Jeff bezos takes over the world with Amazon drones you will regret what you said
no extra greeting for the subscribers 😢
cmon bro. kinda salty
The rich live like the poor -to feel something,because they get everything & have become engorged and flaccid from constant privilege and comfort. They're able to reach the higher levels of the pyramid of needs/life and can live so luxuriously. Imagine choosing to suffer so much, lol. I like your schedule better, Curtis♡
the alpha breathing thing is literally just the breathing exercises band teachers sometimes make you do
Your curls enjoyed the cold showers though
I had a dream I was walking into walls like a GTA player
If you're a member of Kurtis town you must do his prescribed morning routine. If you don't, the whole town gets to make you write to feel lists until you get arthritis.
damn where u live your house already like u rich
Can someone explain what my inner my subconscious is trying to "solve" when I dreamed about the milk going bad and in the carton was a giant ball of curdled milk
Today you feel       NOTHING 😂😂😂
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
28:55 i like that plate
hey, i know the comment section of ur most recent video probably isnt the best place to contact you, but i was watching some of your stuff on my ipad and just noticed that the manswers vid is now age restricted.  idk how long it’s been like that, and i doubt ur even gonna see this comment because u probably turn off notifs for comments after the first day a vids out, but i figured id try to let you know anyway in case you were unaware.
Negative 20 celsius or fahrenheit? Also, i am very stupid.  Kurtis is canadian and my texas brain can believe that -20F is realistically cold up there dont crucify me please.
13:48 I laughed so hard I woke up my roommate
The most consistent thing of my morning routine is just waking up and listening to music. It's never a routine list of things
Watch Kurtis alpha breath made me piss myself
Busy writing my tadoo list on a morning stroll.        Get's hit by truck*
10:30 omfg this how I make my smoothies too dfghnjkl. just there's a chocolate meal replacement powder in it too
nice
I am now convinced that billionaires are an evolved species of humans
13:13 The meditation guy sounds like Mark Rylance's character in Don't Look Up but looks like a fake old Andy Samberg.
Yall talking about his jokes, im just losing my mind over Kurtis' nice as hell shower
I always crack up at all of your videos, but this one had me rolling. Come back to AZ and do a showwww.
off topic but you and jenna did a really good job decorating your house its so pretty lol
THIS PART 😭😭 11:52
I wouldn't say George Lucas or Steven Spielberg exploited the working class.
no but meditation is the best thing i've ever done for mental health
Minus the cold shower, dumbass smoothie, breathing, and “brain training,” this actually seems like a solid start to a day off. Giving yourself some time to relax and set yourself up for the day is a good idea, assuming you have the time to do that.
these kind of videos tickle different
Oh the mullet is on point!!!😂🤣😂🤣  https://youtu.be/C8NmXe0vqF0
Kurtis! I have that same tie dye guitarist/zombie shirt! It's the best
"OH they already made a Cats movie? I should watch that"  No you should not ❤
Sounds like green light by matthew McConaughey Lol scratch that it doesn't. But a big hell ya to Kurtis for his recommended morning routine!
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCG40qIwJaC0P1wd_QnoCNAA/videos
I’m now depressed that I have the same eye problem as Jeff bezos
like i always say, it’s not about working harder, it’s about working unethically 😌
To-do? To-feel? To-be?  This dude needs To-get some bitches.
That’s a really nice shower though
that's not a morning routine, that's a morning saga
https://youtu.be/fbDAby3c5PE
Sorry to be all serious about this, but body shaming is NEVER okay even if the person it's targeted at "deserves it" because when you ridicule bad people's physical traits, good people who also have those traits will hear it and apply it to themselves.
I got oily skin so cold showers don't make me feel clean. Warm then a little cold on at least my face and back is nice
"Today you feel nothing."
Happy New Year, Kurtis 😌🥳🥳
Judging by the thumbnail, those all sound like things Connor needs....Too bad hes not a billionaire.
For real I would k!ll for a review of cats 2019 by you lmao
Hearing kurtis  call billionaires “losers” fed something deep in me that I didn’t know I needed
Giggling hysterically through all of this
babe you might wanna put ice in that smoothie
Now I wanna make a video series of "billionaire secrets" where I dress like a rich person and just do really dumb nonsensical things while claiming they'll give me fortune and fame XD
SWEET BABY RAY'S
All your political takes are exhausting, I’m just tryna relax, man. 👎
Mr. Conner,  I followed your new morning routine and now I'm in prison for murder and I don't remember doing it.  Please help. Thanks!  ~Ray
That's literally the "How to be a human" list that some special kind of sociopath would come up with
The breathing part made me so uncomfortable wtf
Kurtis: working out is good to get the blood flowing   Kurtis: *starts hitting the jerk.*
It´s funny how Kurtis is shaming on billionaires but damn, I wish I had his house at least.
https://youtu.be/Ilecmb9EKRsp
why does he talk so slowly
Kurtis My only problem as with this is I was a manager at Taco Bell for 4 years and I would do the same thing for 13 hours straight so like… 3 things is a lot.
Kurtis looked so genuinely sad after a sip of the awful smoothie
9:09 I was literally playing Call of Duty zombies while this played in the background, this scared the SHIT out of me
Oh my god not the sedrick diggory death scene I can’t-
you forgot to put brains in your smoovi
Bruh i love cold showers does that mean I can easily be a billionaire
The REAL billionaire routine is up there with the trainspotting “choose life” monologue
22:49 Kutis really getting sturdy 😏
Lol the crazy horny kurtis. I love kurtis, he’s my favourite, Canada wooh!
I have been doing sigma breathing for 4 months now and it has been life changing. I am closer to dying now😋
Kurtis is Number 3 on trending; good job!
Wow. Kurtis suffers so much for us. He even took a cold shower for our sake!
Plastic spoons   https://youtu.be/AQMtyR7cLwc
Omg please shave Kurtis the time has come
“At some point your going to have to exploit the working class”….. J.K. Rowling? She literally just wrote stuff onto paper
i loved every moment of this; please do close ups when you taste the brain smoothies lol
Kurtis you have one of those waterfall showers, you basically already are a billionaire
Cold showers are good for your scalp, blood, and immune system!
As someone who puts spinach and blueberries in my smoothies... that's a terrible smoothie... "It's not enough to give people what they need to survive, you need to give them what they need to live." -Ekko
Wow Love this bideo us this a Bullionare in this video ..?
this is ur best video of all time 💪
does kurtis just wake up pretty share your ways, o kurt the wise
dang ur alpha breath STINKS!!!!
I'm so excited to start the Kurtis Connor morning routine
I took cold showers and I felt like that man. You build a flinch resistance to it and the more you do it the less you think about and just do it. I apply it to other parts of my life like washing the pile of fudging dishes
This dude is a millionaire
The thing that tells me their morning routine is bullshit is that it's following the same trend as other forms of internet content. They're continuously getting more extreme, most noticeably in how early they say to get up. It used to be 7, then 6, then 5, then 4, and now I'm seeing some people saying 1-3 am. Unless you work a job with very unusual hours, there's absolutely nothing healthy about waking up at basically midnight. I'm not a farmer, I don't go to bed at dusk. You know what's way healthier than waking up at some arbitrary hour? Making sure you get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. If you wake up at 6, go to bed at 10; doesn't matter when you wake up, as long as it's about 8 hours after you went to sleep. But a lot of these liars are saying the exact opposite, even though there's abundant evidence that not getting enough sleep is really bad for you.
Avocado smoothies are the great but you have to sweeten them. I like skinny syrups especially when I was keto cause no sugar or vanilla protein powder is usually sweet enough as well.. But I'm not a millionaire I'm barely a thousandaire... Why don't we use that term.. I have enough money to not worry about my bills every month! YEA!
I don't want a billion dollars. I just want enough money to be able to live a normal life without having to worry about not having enough
Number 3 on trending baby ❤️✨
please make a video that is only filled with you roasting billionaires
5:32 I literally spat my drink LMAO
Your dream means u know you should stop doing something but you’re doing it still
Lmao the moving around part was hilarious
Lol
I think Kurtis was right about 2022 being worse, were not even half way through January and there’s a Tsunami warning IN SUMMER. WHY AM I AUSTRALIAN.
All I got out of this is how nice Kurtis’ place is
I don't know what the pissing on the bed dream meant, I think I need a video on you peeing on the bed to find out
daily affirmations t shirt swag
You dont have to be a billionaire to better yourself. The point is to push yourself to want to have more positive routines. At the end of the day anyone can say they want to be better. Only people who give their all consistently make the change. Youve got to have the same mindset as an olympian.
My brother takes cold showers and i don't get why
Kurtis pretended to be a class traitor for exactly 3 seconds before dunking on billionaires.. u gotta respect it.
My question is when does he brush his teeth?
the alpha breathing was so scary
Sssshhhhhiiiiiiiiit.    I want some cosmic brownies.
I love that the mayor of Kurtistown calls spinach “Spinnidge”
I learned today that Kurtis has weird ass dreams and I’m here for it
Like a cool business lion
I carefully interpreted your dreams with my brain interpretation and arrives at the conclusion that you will disrupt the aviation industry by employing a lot of spider men and letting them transport the people without any carbon emissions.
That's a pornstache but there's no porn!   What a scam.
Americans need to accept failure! No country can rule the world forever! Just like the failure of British colonialism!
Warden Buffets morning routine is to get an egg McMuffin and a coffee and read the paper. That’s it lol
7:36 if you take cold showers in the morning you’ll automatically get out of it wanting to exploit people out of frustration
He looked so sad when he drank that stupid smoothie 😂😂
Kurtis please do a cats the musical reaction I promise you will not regret
Little does Kurtis know, I already do the real billion dollar routine 😎
The look of disgust as he poured the smoothie had me dying!! Keep it up Kurtis!
stop saying bitch
LMFAOOOOO THE HOTEL BED DREAM
I wanna try that routine you came up with ngl
What the fuck I have that blender and those exact brands of blueberries and spinach in my fridge right now
Alpha breathing sounds like a demon slayer techniques lol
I’m sensing piss kink with the dream
of course you don't like tea if you drink it with the bag still in it???
maybe I'm just tired and had a rough morning but dude ? the hard giggles are nonstop this video. kurtis, my boy, you really did something here. thank you <3
all he knows is fine dining…and *breathing*
Cold showers are good for your scalp, blood, and immune system!
I love YouTube videos that end in “I basically just wasted my time for a week.” Pure gold.
I don't remember many of my dreams but I Remember the one where I had to use the bathroom and bowser from Mario wouldn't let me use his bathroom.
A lot of the list is just... normal daily activity that most people spread throughout the day. Also, no. I will not do cold showers ._.
Where is that bed frame from I kinda like it
Omg where did u get that shirt!?
Yes!!! I get the extra greeting!!!
You’re wrong about dreams. Your level of understanding of the subconscious is like that of a 12 year old. Embarrassing. 🤷
holy crap you can pee in your dreams and not wake up or piss yourself irl??? witchcraft
14:20 Meditation takes discipline. It's great that you got to ten minutes on your first time. You usually have to build up to even that, but 20 minutes is optimal and if you actually keep doing it, it can have great benefits you can research on your own. Maybe you'll even get to 30 minutes or an hour.
This video is a work of art.
Bro sweet sweet for that nose ring 🙅🏻‍♂️🤷
“the dawn of the first day” and then i get hit with a dawn dish soap ad 😂😂
Umm.... why would ya wana be horney all day? That sounds horrible walkn round with a stiffy all day.  But that's just me...
It was a mistake to watch this while getting tattooed- I'm trying so hard not to laugh XD
what a waste, should have kept this one mate
This is like a 3hr morning routine... most people have like 45min.
💵 I'm going to identify as a billionaire  and buy an island with invisible 💵⚡︎
kurtis i had a dream where u posted a silly picture on the internet and someone commented "it's even funnier once you see he's filing his taxes in the background" and you replied to them with "haha 😂😅 you got me" and a picture of a piece of graph paper at the top of which you had written in pencil "Filing My Taxes" and the only other thing on the paper was a row of boxes that you had scribbled in, please help me guys i need to know what this means
The intro was everything. Roasting billionaires and their questionable taste is very enjoyable. Very tired of seeing those guys portrayed as role models by buisness journalists lmao. Most of them are straight up musky.
Even in their sleep, they're working like ewww
Honestly, the real list of things to do to become a billionaire would probably include you joining an MLM or starting one
Hey, dream interpreter here, taking a piss on a bed in a hotel room actually means good vibes for the entire year! No need to thank me 💕🌿
#3 on trending.. omg Kurtis!!!!!!
those are all the motherfuckers that purchased their pod ticket on "DON'T LOOK UP". like every one of them were old yt people... and a sprinkle of color. they weren't far off with the realism of that movie which is the scary part. yes, it's satirical but we're the punchline.... but yalls fave actors were in it so it's okay... fuck capitalism and fuck billionaires!! burn the rich! LOL
your first dream might mean you’re going to explode
Heyyyy kurtis your mustache kinda looks like a Moth lol
Y’all I just figured out billionaires are secretly millennial white girls
dang ur alpha breath stinks dude 🤢
Okay so the guy who made the morning routine video (I believe it’s Jim Kwik) is actually super dope and I’ve been readying his book and stuff and it’s actual fact based information on your brain and body and he does explain why these things are beneficial. Meditating daily actually does increase your attention span, cold showers cause your body to produce more dopamine, and your breathing habits do actually affect your mood A LOT so love the video but a lot of these teachings really are incredibly beneficial for your brain and body regardless of financial status obviously. I would personally recommend Jim Kwik’s content 😊 (still love all of kurtis’ videos tho)
Comrade Kurtis shaming billionaires is all i need
Thanks Kurtis! I think I’ll try your morning routine!
People that like cold showers are definitely from the south or California where their cold water is like 60 degrees, the cold water up north in the winter is fucking cold it gives you brain freeze
I never noticed the eye thing with Bezos, now I can’t unsee it great 😂
I’m only about 7 minutes into the video and it is genuinely already one of the funniest videos I’ve watched. Not even just from Kurtis, just in general.
Idk about anyone else but I would love a video of you just roasting tf out of billionaires
The stuff this morning routine is, is just about maintaining good mental health. Most of that stuff is just take some time to breath and relax and stuff, which if you're poor not only do you have very little time, you also don't have the energy or even the resources to do that stuff. There's no way an average person can wake up at 4 in the morning, do a dozen activities, and then be at work at 7.
6:37
I spent the first third of this video brushing my dog. It's not even the morning and I think that would already be a way better morning routine. Happy cute fluffy dog, a serotonin from making a cute animal happy, what more should i need?
Kurtis the decorations in your house are so pretty
"Dang ur alpha breath stinks"
these guys spend their whole day getting ready for the day
Ok can we appreciate kurtis morning hair it's cute
I’m a big believer in having a morning and evening routine but that just sounded EXHAUSTING. It was every single stereotypical habit you could throw into a routine. I think it’s much more impactful to have ONE single thing that you do every morning to get your day started and ONE single thing every night to unwind. Or not a specific routine but just time you set aside for self care
Wooooo
I'm only 4 min into the video and I absolutely love it.
dream interpreter here! that dream u had about pissing the hotel bed actually just means ur a little piss boy. a pissy little piss boy who was probably a little pissed off by the pissy hotel service. hope this helps!
The gag he did after the “human beings” line was the funniest thing I’ve ever heard
Not the Goblet of Fire clip… I’m cryinggg
CONGRATS ON #3 ON TRENDING 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Your skin looks better, probably the cold showers
I have been personally victimized by Kurtis' alpha breathing
I love HeadSpace!!!
r u still broke
i don't work a will very Rich
6:37 You look like one of them fucker from Mandela Catalogue.
kurtissss u didn't put ice in the smoothieeee
kurtis i have a lazy eye just like jeff bezos :(
Dang bro your alpha breath stinks 😩
the other night i had a dream that i posted a tiktok of me dancing and it got 4 likes and 26 comments and everyone was telling me to never dance again. like i don’t even dance? i don’t post dancing tiktoks??? what
Going to try the actual billioner morning routine right away,  having a heart attack due to a smoothie seems like a great idea 👍
The alpha breathing bit was TERRIFYING WOW
Well i take 2 cold showers a day and got offended that Kurtis didn't want to at the start, then I remembered that he lives in a cold country, and I live in a tropical one, with around 100°F every day i would melt if i didn't take a cold shower multiple times, wouldn't do it if winter tho.
comrade kurtis
dang ur alpha breathing stinks lol
the human beings/human doings thing was much better said by scatman john in his hit single "scatmans world"  kurtis please live a week like scatman john
can we all just neutrally agree that bullying rich ppl is ok?   _I mean they're not the ones paying the taxes in here..._ just saying..._
This was fun to watch 😂  I hope you're doing okay man. The mental health thing was only one of the highly relatable parts bout this video.  Also sorry to make it weird but you're cute af lmao
I had a dream someone kept putting worms in my clothes… so it was you.
"making a to-feel list - the life of a socipath"
The pain when the word "cold shower" appeared on the screen was palpable
i need an entire 20 min video of kurt making fun of rich old guys
nice
real talk, i might actually adopt that moving for 2 minutes thing... with my line of work it's probably good to actually have a warm-up
This man called a list of billionaires the Bingo Hall of Fame and I have ceased existing
All those ingredients weren't for one smoothie lol
Main take away point: Everyone who says they do all this stuff in the morning is absolutly lying.
I'm tired of this racism
When I become a billionaire I’m getting all the homies new teeth
laughs at jeff's lazy eye knowing full well that i have one too, but hey, mine's because i have brain cancer. his is probably just because he's ugly #bodyshamebillionaires2022
4:14 Ok billionaire, good like with recalling the dream of your cat wet-pooped all over the carpet and your middle school teacher trying to hijack a tourist bus.
maybe the reason so many billionaires are assholes is because they have to take a cold shower every morning
idk if I should recall my dreams, once I dreamt that I had a baked bean themed birthday party
kurtis did you ever get your pen license???
When he was dancing in the intro reminded me of Squidward at the talent show
I love cold showers. I just sit under the running water doing nothing and listening to depressed music. Where are my billions
Wait til you hear about Sexual Kung Fu breathing
7:13
didn’t even brush his teeth or washed his face once..... but i guess you get to be gross when you’re a billionaire
The breathing guy is literally the billionaire from don't look up
The dream part made me snort. I had a dream the other day that some cracked out version of Santa Clause broke into my parent’s house while I was visiting and no one believed me until he showed up. Then we went to shoot him and he somehow made the bullet go out the other side of the gun, and shot my dad in the neck.  So yeah I don’t think me recalling that is going to bring me monetary success, just more shit to explain to my therapist.
are we sure these guys even work bc i would have to get up at like 4am every day to do all this shit before i go in for my double
Kurtis where is my extra greeting 😭
Never seen this guy before. Seems like a cool dude tho. Would do mushrooms with.
use me as a dislike button
26:40 I snorted
Kurtis I really think they put more things in the smoothie than that
my eye looks just like jeff's </3  truly a sad day for BigLeftEyedPeople everywhere
Warren buffet has overcast teeth killed me
This is giving very much Modern Patrick Bateman vibes
shoutout to my therapist that used to tell me “it’s human being not human doing” and then tell me i should just do yoga to get rid of my depression
your handwritiing is so bad i love it
please make a video where u just make fun of rich old guys. would love to see it
kurtis has gone full country boy
You look at like the dude on the your favorite weapon cover
i want to see kurtis do a week of his batshit crazy morning routine
let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us
"recount your dreams" me who only has a dream once or twice a month if im lucky: hm yes
this might be my new favourite video of yours.
!!!!
KURTIS IS ON #3 ON TRENDING 🎉🎉
If I am a millionaire or a billionaire, I'll hire someone to skip these shitty things, why should I make my bed, make a tea, make a brain smoothie ...etc. What's the point to be wealthy then?!!!!!
The wise words of billionaire Kurtis Connor.  "Wish I cou, I wish I could, I'd ra, nng uh, yanno?"
Hi Kurtis, I interpret dreams.   The doctor/worm dream could mean you're openly allowing negative energies into your life and it's causing you problems. Your mental health is asking you to look at what is wrong and stop it before it gets worse.
A 30min Kurtis video HELL YEAH
I’m fine sticking with my routine personally. Wake up at 8, do two hours of practice (mainly sword swings and standing on one leg) then go take a shower, go to Dutch bros and get a rebel, go drive for a bit and do what I can think of, then go to work two hours early so I can keep getting big boy checks.
(continuing on what kurtis said about level playing fields) guess how many women are in the top 100 richest ppl in the world? 13 guess how many are lgbtq? none
I just know this is going to be fucking hilarious, kurtis never disappoints ❤️
I wish I was even making pennies on the dollar?
The alpha breathing guy  reminds me of Jordan Peterson but somehow worse
Me "Hey kurtis Conner made a new vid" GF "Kurtis Communist?"
Lllll
Ah dang kurtis #1 on trending, I guess the routine worked
there is no way the person who made the video is an actual billionaire
I’ve had a dream about the French mafia being after me, I wonder what it’s trying to tell me
I gotta leave for work at 7am how am I gonna fit all this into the morning
dang ur alpha breath stinks man
I actually really liked this video, I used to be obsessed with having a perfect morning routine that's like insanely productive and stuff and always wondered why I was never able to sustain it. Now I think its because I simply didn't enjoy doing the things and now I have a routine on my days off that I actually enjoy and if for some reason I don't do it for one day that's fine. These insane routine videos are seriously so stupid and if you would really follow them I feel like you would waste so much time. Also if I have to be at work at 7am how am I supposed to have a morning routine that takes like two hours?! Most people simply don't have the option to have a routine like this, also what about shift-workers? These videos come from such a privileged point of view.
Why did the choose the worst motivational video
Have you starred in the New Kids, Kurtis? The resemblance is uncanny...
Y IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT KURTIS'S SHOWER IT LOOKS IT'S LIKE RAIN INSTEAD OF THE AIRPOD NOSSEL WHAT IS THAT
Kurtis, baby, tea is not talking shit about someone that's shade lmao
Never shave that mustache this is totally your look
"hot take on cold showers" hehe
Ontario had spent more time in lockdown than not 😡
#2 ON TRENDING???? CONGRATS BAE
6:05 it's literally just breathing why are ppl making it more complicated 😭😭
It’s fine to bully a rich person. They can afford therapy
i literally laughed so hard that i stopped breathing and then realized i was beta breathing this whole time!   now im typing this from beyond the grave because i got too good for breathing 😁
That shirt is one size too big kurtis 😣
the reason why it might not be good to body shame anyone (including billionaires) is if someone whos not a billionaire has the same problem they have. fuck billionaires tho just dont body shame lol
27:15 Loving the clip from the stay out of the basement goosebumps episode. Legendary
When u post a new video I get so excited and ur literally one of my favorite content creators so thanks for being a cool guy
I fucking love Kurtis Conner, holy shit.
Bruh that smoothie looked disgusting hahahaha
being unable to meditate when you dont do it normally I think is pretty normal, mindfulness is still really difficult for me because my mind is constantly running. It's cool that you were able to do it and enjoy it.
idk if i took some giggle juice today or what but this was the funniest thing i’ve ever watched
ok to be fair i also often have a lot of dreams where im using the bathroom or taking a shower in places i should not  but in those dreams i dont have a choice
Wait....what are the "other gems" that are in his tea??
His morning consists of a glass of water, a cup of tea and then a smoothie
"Alpha breathing, first form. SLASH OF THE CHAD"
Holy shit he used Cedric Diggorys father reacting to his sons dead body as a gag and I didn’t even do a spit take, I just straight threw up on my phone because it caught me so off guard.
oh my god kurtis PLEASE watch Cats and do a video on it, it will shock you in all of the worst ways
feel like you should have used kale instead of spinach 😭
How much of his day does this morning routine take? 4am - 11:59am?
i seriously didn’t know kurtis had legs
lmao the furry art took me off guard
I hate how relatable the first minute of this video is. And please, body shame Jeff Bunghole ALL. DAY.
My morning to do list only has 5 things. And one of those is taking a piss sooo
I. Have always had cold showers
I had to take cold showers for 2 months when our hot water wasn't working and I did not feel healthier. Just cold and sad.
Tempted to do a week of Kurtis’s billion dollar morning routine just to feel something
Eat 27 worms a day
Im sorry but the alpha breathing scene made me cry from laughter
the only reason to take a cold shower is after a work out or if you just woke up and are hot and sweaty
billionaires can do all that shit in the morning because they don't have real jobs. they work like maybe two hours a day.
The fact that Jeff bezos is actually starting to resemble Dr. Evil from Austin Powers is concerning me.
Dude that "Human BEING not human DOING" line is stright up from a Scatman song
This video was definently very entertaining to watch, I do really like your other content too, but if you made more videos like this, I'd definitely watch them
4:00 “I’m gonna be a Billionaire with a Bee” fucking stupid🤣
So funny!!
great video kurtis please stop eating worms
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING THATS CRAZY OMGGG congrats 😌
I fucking pissed my pants laughing at the alpha breathing part
the current trend of commentary youtubers leaving the clips where they stutter and confuse themselves in the video is so nice. it's funny and human
It’s fun being a billionaire. It’s like having the keys to everything.
"The first thing I do when I wake up is I recall my dreams" Me: -violently recalls dream about a man who broke into my house just to ask for spicy fried chicken-
Kurtis just absolutely stunting on us with his waterfall shower head
kurtis youre bad at puzzles
Was that a clip from Goosebumps Stay out of the Basement at 27:14?
iumkpijo
woah curtis made #1 on trending
Why did I decide to watch this while taking a bath? Idk, but more importantly, my boyfriend walked in while Kurtis was learning how to do alpha breathing. I yelled at my boyfriend I was relaxing and to get out. It was funny I guess you had to be there.
ya boy Kurtis is #1 on trending!!!
why do "alpha billionaires" always have that weird high wispy voice like they're kermit
NUMBER ONE TRENDING!!! First step to becoming a billionaire achieved

the batshit crazy morning routine kurtis came up with actually seems more enjoyable than the other one

Yes old “white” guys. A lot of those guys are “ white” in the same way Israel is a “white” country.
This is probably the funniest video holy shit fuck billionaires what fuccin weirdos 😂
Lol exploit the working class
How to actually become a billionaire:  -Start a business -Provide a good or a service that solves a problem for millions of people (it's easy!)  Cheat codes (don't tell anybody): -Pay your employees as little as you can get away with -Avoid paying taxes -Do everything to prevent your employees from unionizing -Lobby the government to pass laws that let you make more money -Use your superior capital and market share to force smaller companies out of the market so you don't have to compete -If you can't force them out, just buy them outright -Just have parents who are rich as fuck  Follow these easy rules, and you too can be a billionaire! Well, more likely you'll just end up a broke asshole. But you could *maybe* be a billionaire!
this was the weirdest way to do a house tour
Honestly I’m sick at the out of context Mr. Diggory scene you cut in there 🤢😭.
that true billion dollar morning routine at the end is essentially how I lived every single summer break of my school career
for smoothies you can add in vegetables and fruit and shit but add juice or agave if it tastes like shit
I've had the "wet the bed at a hotel" and woke up in a puddle of my own pee in a hotel bed next to a man I had just started dating. We're married now.
This guy is just not funny. It’s unfathomable how he has so many people drooling over his poor attempt at comedy.
idk if u watched “dont look up” yet but the alpha breathing guy looks like the creepy app billionaire in the film
Kurtis, you look.. so close to Henry Cavill
LITERALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU
also dang ur alpha breath stinks!! haha
Make more videos like this!!!!!!!!
Kurtis having a dream about a big space ship on the moon then being scared is so funny
I love dreaming and “recalling” my dreams. I often want to go back sleep and finish or continue the story 🥲.
https://youtu.be/HfEMK3iVUFI

theres no reason i shouldve laughed this damn loud the whole video. i also prefaced this with the "tiktok's un-motivational speaker". lol
hilarious
your camera quality is something else!!
I love your handwriting kurtis 😍

No. 1 on trending!!!
I love your commentary style videos but I always enjoy these types of videos too!! The magician video and the pokemon card videos were fucking hilarious bro~ love all of it
Not going to lie, I actually don't hate the majority of this morning routine advice (except for the cold shower, that's insane), but it would definitely be impossible to consistently incorporate all of these into my morning. Edit: I agree with almost all of Kurtis's Buy/Sell choices, except I prefer tea to coffee.
Your apartment looks SICK can we get a tour? Or am I unaware of one that exists already?? Cuz dang
I cant stop thinking about how he kept saying spinage instead of spinach
Number one on trending let’s go bois
My routine is wake up at 5, cry a little, go to school
You know...it actually makes perfect sense that a billionaire's typical response to the working class on how to get to their impossibly high monetary level is "just keep working".
number one on trending yass king
your mullet is so 😍 ok king!!!!
Watching the Alpha breathing tutorial made me physically uncomfortable...
i love yogi tea
Wait you live in Canada and my province holy shit where
Hella based.
Hotels in dreams symbolize the you may be going through a change, or alternatively feel that you may have lost a sense of your own identity. Urinating, especially in a public place can symbolize that you are angry you cant express yourself in a positive way and you feel that you have no sense of privacy in your own life.   So, from my perspective you pissing on a hotel bed means that you might like to take your own artistic liberties and change the way you make content but your lack of real privacy in your waking life and how your fans perceive you make you feel like your stuck in the same negative headspace. You do criticize people a lot, and i imagine having a constant negative perspective while creating can cross over into your normal life. I say take that creative liberty kurtis, do something wild. Have some fun, you have the platform to do it, and i think your fans will stick by your creative decisions.   Then again, you could just be pissing on a hotel bed.
Hi...Dari indonesia
Billionaire self help videos are just glorifying and commercialising things everyone always does. You cannot attribute your wealth to things like “Take probiotics and a glass of water” and “recall dreams”. Stop telling me I need to do these things with your help and guidance. It won’t make any difference to my bank account, except deduct the money you are encouraging me to spend on crappy self-help books.
This is one of your best videos
Honestly, that work dream might mean something
Okay, but his smoothie is actually really healthy. I drink one every morning, too. Kale Spinach Carrots Spring mix Broccoli Oats (for extra fiber) Blueberries A slice of ginger Water It's primarily a veggie drink. Don't get me wrong, it tastes like absolute sh*t, but it's the main way I get my daily intake. I drink two a day and bypass my tongue using a long straw so I don't have to taste it.
Kurtis drop the skincare routine
Aka what a billionaire does every morning to convince themselves they're still a normal human being (they're not)
plot twist, kurtis is already a billionaire
i had a dream last night where i was robin and i was working with robert pattinson’s batman, which then switched over to ryan and shane from watcher doing a prison break down a water slide. i’m not sure i want to know what my subconscious is trying to fix with that one.
Yeah start meditating at 10 minutes. Eventually, if you keep practicing you'll be able to go for longer. But for beginners, you normally can't REALLY get in that zone and after 10 minutes you're just begging for it to end, which defeats the point.
"My out of touch morning routine"
I never noticed Bezos eye and now I'll never unsee it like Tom Cruise middle front tooth I recently discovered 😂😂
This is now one of my favorite videos by you lmao🤠🤠🤠I used to think a mullet and mustache combo wasn’t attractive but over the years I find it hot as fuck now
A few innaccracies, the vast majority of Forbes 500 list is self made. Like they inhereted less than the average person in wealth.  Also, they dont "have a billion dollars", they stocks worth that much. They cant liquidate that without crashing their comapnies and livelyhoods.
the list sounds like a shitpost like the guy just didnt know he was allowed to stop listing things and if u body shame someone youre also saying to other people with that attribute that theyre bad but also fuck b*llionaires
"You're allowed to body shame a billionaire." Words to live by
This video actually made me feel a lot better about myself because I struggle to have a consistent routine because of my mental health and a lot of the shit I see on social media makes me feel bad about the routines I have developed. Reminder that social media really is just social media
I have to get up so super early in the morning I have no time for breathing and thinking about hydration while drinking tea and writing in some journal at 4am!
Lion’s mane in TEA???????
#1 on trending rn lol
Honestly though, for anyone that may actually be trying to switch up their morning routine I highly suggest Amy Landino's video on how to structure your morning. It's very basic, essentially all you really need to incorporate is mindfulness, movement, and mastery. This could be as simple as being more mindful during your daily activities like enjoying the action of making coffee, taking a short walk or some stretching, and doing some reading or journaling. It's 3 basic activities that have been helpful for myself to start my day well. I will say though good ol' fashioned H20 truly is a beneficial addition. In the end, you gotta do what works best for you. If you do your best rolling out of bed, getting some coffee and getting straight to work, then I say more power to you!
is no one going to talk about the amount of flight/airport dreams kurtis has had?? like?? maybe his billionaire recipe is just going on tours guys :/
PewDiePie is a multimillionaire, and when asked how one can become rich his answer was the most honest and down-to-earth thing I've ever heard: "Luck. It's all luck. Yeah, there's some hard work that goes into it, but mostly I got very lucky."
Thank you for this video comrade  Nice agit prop intro Class solidarity forever ✊⚒️
“Or is that crazy?”
Nice video kurty
okay but like a minute of a cold rinse at the end of your shower REFRESHING
The alpha breathing bit was genuinely terrifying
I like to imagine the first dream was a metaphor for you thinking about your new morning routine. The hotel is your new lifestyle (cuz it's not yours) and the piss in the bed is your disrespect for that lifestyle because you hate billionaires. Similarly, you pissed in the bed like you were pouring a cup of water or perhaps even making tea. Pee? More like tea.
Damn your a jealous dude.
why does kurtis seem evil in this video. hes acting like a serial killer. unhinged
So you systematically blackmailed various politicians with Child sex tapes. Like Epstein?
why does he sound exactly like ryan fucking reynolds
sooo did anyone catch the part where the dude said there’s lion’s mane in his tea ???
I have to be at work at 8 am almost every day of the week, with 19 hour shifts in 9 days of every single month ....  this morning routine is for people who have no real job and just have too much money they don't need work
This dude is a pessimist start with that and it will change your life
https://youtu.be/3tyOVnOXGxw
congrats on #1 on trending kurt!
Dude all ur dreams are strictly anxiety dreams. I can tell you deal with a lot of anxiety lol.
i don't think i've ever laughed this much while watching a video lmaoo loved this one a lot!
Kurtis..this is number one on trending
I love how most of this is just him shitting on billionaires
All the breathing actually made me dizzy
People who do this morning routine have to a) have gotten a lot of money through passive income sources and b) have literally nothing else going on in their lives because anyone who has a job or school or literally anywhere else to be everyday isn’t drinking two smoothies every morning and meditating for 20 minutes.
@16:03 is the best part
#1 in trending BABEY!!
Excuse me, lion’s mane? Like from lion’s?
kurtis' dreams are EXACTLY what i expected them to be for some reason
Spitting facts and so fkn funny
see like....it annoys me when guys like this "billionaire" do videos like this on their morning routine...like...theres actually some really good things in there to do! But he comes off so douchey about it....drink a glass of water in the morning is great for you! Journaling is awesome! Creating intentions for your day/week or whatever help keep you focused...setting aside a little time to just breath or "meditate" feels nice. eating healthy is good lol....but yeah, fuck cold showers!
Loved this!!! Please make more videos like this
twenty minutes of meditation is a FUCK ton of time. Most people who do meditation daily only do five minutes. i appreciate the thought but even as a writer myself reading as part or a morning routine sounds like a nightmare. ill just read when i want thanks.
Kurtis's face after drinking that smoothie was absolutely priceless, poor guy, he was trying his best surely!
kurtis mustache look like two long ass brown malteses kissing each other. change my mind
This whole video was just a house flex
One of your best! 😂👏
great video. I laughed out loud a lot I took cold showers for 1 whole month at age 13 [bc I'm "quirky"] and it was torture. still 15 years later every time I step in the shower I am grateful that it's warm.
Whatever kind of content Curtis makes, it’ll be great. This was fun
Reply to this with your morning routines! I’m curious what other people do. Here’s mine:  When I wake up I have to drink a little bit of water because I sleep with my mouth WIDE OPEN and my mouth and throat are so dry it hurts. Then I take my prescription nose spray because I have nose problems (which is why I sleep with my mouth wide open). Then I get up and eat something, anything immediately, because if I do stuff while I’m hungry, I will throw up (or dry heave). Then if it’s a school day I make my lunch. then I do my make up, then put on deodorant, then get dressed, then do my hair, then brush my teeth, then I’m good to go.
this style of video is what you should lean ur content towards being consistently i think these deep dives are your best videos tbh and i can see you going somewhere and doing a lot with ideas like this and a few others you’ve done
NEW KURT VID
How are you going to make a smoothly without ice?? Would’ve been much more palatable
Not a lot of guys can pull off both long hair and a mustache.. Kurtis is on to something
I am glad you liked the meditation Kurtis! I volunteer at a Zen Buddhist temple in Toronto and it'd be dope if you stopped by for a sitting some time
And the best thriller/horror movie of the year award does to that fucking alpha breathing guy
If I use my blender at 5 am (which would be a little under two hours before I leave for work), my neighbour might publicly execute me
How do you have one of those white crusty dogs but it actually doesn't look all crusty and gross?!?!?
If people say that hot showers are bad for your skin, why not just take a medium warm shower? Why’s it gotta be freezing instead?
I know it's all jokes n shit, but actually Feeling what you wish for and living from it creates miracles. Look up Neville Goddard or Joe Dispenza for more info.
your videos make me feel so seen Kurtis
"bingo hall of fame" got me
Ur mom should be on the to do list
Blueberries and avocados are actually a really delicious combo for smoothies. Replace the water with milk and I think it would’ve been pretty good.
although I disagree with probably every single political opinion you have, I still liked the video 👍
alpha breathing look like my cat when she overheats
Some of these are really good habits. None of them will make you a billionaire. I do half this stuff for self-care just to make sure I don't yell at my kid.
my morning routine is waking up and dreading existence
i feel like the anti-billionaire morning routine would cure me, not even kidding
Comrade Conner is no longer mayor of Kurtistown, he is Grand Commissar of the People’s Republic of Kurtisburg ⭐️✊🏼🇻🇳
Ok, hate to say it but his curls look so good because of the cold shower
I liked the living like WeWearCute video better.
Yeah...i thought those billionaires slept in their offices and ate dinner out of a can to get where they were. Lol
Making your bed is super underrated. Me and my wife both hate doing it but we love how good it feels to get into nice, clean(ish), flat sheets. Feels like being at a hotel! we started callin em "hotel sheets" any time the bed is made.
Dang I didn't even realize you were doing the Rugrats title changes for every subject until the very end, lol 👌🏼
No Cedric ☹
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
It’s funny because a lot of their “routine” could be done living a minimalist, inexpensive, lifestyle. If they wanna be such an alpha why don’t they just live in the woods off the land where they can rly be one with the earth (ya know cause all that meditation he’s doing he should already be pretty close…)
you lived like me
Your hair reminds me of Weird Al in a good way
the entire video was a segway for the hello fresh sponsor
Give breathing exercises a try. They’re great
as a professional dream interpreter i can say with confidence that the first dreams shows how much kurtis is in love with andrew garfield and the second shows that he wants to assert dominance over the bed his wife sleeps with/on every night
yeah, funny video kurtis, but billionaire? i hardly know her.
I would rather do warren buffets routine, coke, Dairy Queen, and McDonald’s everyday
So this guy really wasted the opportunity to call his brain training "braining"
The morning rituals should be something easy and simple to do. I usually like to start immediately with my work for a short period of time (20-30 minutes max) when I'm just off the bed, even before breakfast, since I'm a massive procrastinator and I've figured this helps me a lot with my productivity throughout the day. Then I've recently discovered meditation so I put on some guided meditation YT video (after breakfast) (10-15 minutes max) and then I get back to work without even showering. (I usually do it afterwards, just before leaving the house, during the day or before going to bed). I also write a journal, but quite inconsistently and only when I feel like, so I guess that's the reason I'm not a billionaire. Don't take caffeine unless you need to for intense workload or because you feel particularly tired that day. So you need to take less to feel more energetic and you won't get too attached to coffee.
this ain’t 🅿️
666k views everybodyyyyyy ESKETIT
Omg i was crying at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Thomas the tank full blast
The beta morning routine is my real morning routine idk how he got this information
22:50 - 22:55 kurtis with the moves 👊
I though this billionaire basically had FOMO for all the morning routine videos which are basically just ads, so he made one without even having a sponsor. And then he turned it into an ad.
A sleeve of saltines sounds so good rn
When kurtis was explaining his problems at the beginning of the video, I was like “wow he’s turning into a 40 year old mom”
your shower is beautiful wtf????????
18:35 - 18:45 the straight look of defeat from that smoothie 💀
this is literally the funniest video I’ve seeen in a long time
“50 shades of gray was named after that guys teeth.” I CRIED LAUGHING omg that’s hilarious
Monty shower loofahs. Nice.
Kurtis I figure I’d tell you I had a dream last night that I was walking around my school with you and told you “Bro Kurtis you look so much like Kurtis Conner”
okay, but i want a video where you roast billionaires. 20 minutes of pure catharsis. you could give us that, man
kurtis marxist era i’m so happy . working class power!
I already do all of these things in the morning and I haven’t had a job in a year.
Hey jokes aside the way I make cold showers bearable is to start off with warm water and slowly change it to colder and colder
I cracked at the point where billionaires don't breathe💀
Best morning routine is coffee and cigarette simple and effective
I tried Kurtis's morning routine for a week and at the end of the routine on the 7th day, I automatically became a billionaire! 💰💰💰 Thank you Mayor Conner!
this video should be called "sex god mullet man teaches plebians how to catch daily wins"
there’s no way this morning routine takes any less than like three hours
dang ur alpha breath stinks
All those internet daily routines are like suplements. If you have deficiencies they might help you. But they won't cure your cancer. And of course it's important to remember that both wellness industry as well as self-help industry are full of scams and quacks
Okay a lot of this is bullshit but the lists are pretty common therapy techniques. However, he's doing 3x too many lists and his lists are fucking stupid
The most surprising part of this was Kurtis actually having decent reject game. Gotta put together a full jerk video now
Bruh dang ur alpha breath stinks. Uh oh stinky
The alpha breathing is horrendous
on the to-be list, i rly thought "a clean boy" said "a clean Gay," and i was like, yes, relatable, thank you, Kurtis, thank you
this video is hilarious. i am drunk, but i'm sure sobriety would lead me to the same conclusion.
why was this the video that made me make my bed and clean my room
The compilation if Curtis stepping into the shower was comedy gold  Edit: Yall I apologise for spelling Kurtis wrong. The C in Curtis is for Canada XD
at the beginning of this video, I took a vitamin because I was like, yeah he's right good vitamin.   at the end i had to go to the bathroom and throw up the vitamin because I didn't eat first.  billionare mindset
I laughed way too long about " it's 2022,the sequel of 2021"
the few seconds of CKY gave me a rush of nostalgia.
"Kurtis Conner pretends to be a billionaire even though he owns a Rolls Royce" - some news outlet probably
… why does the alpha breathing guy sound like the billionaire from “Dont look Up”?
damn that brain smoothie must be really good to make your brain smoother, must be why billionaires are the way they are
The fact you lumped Warren Buffet in with everyone else shows how little you know about him. He's literally told everyone how to become rich ‐ for free - and it's publicly available
What pisses me off about these routines is ppl usually don't have that stuff, so they have to go SPEND money 🙄 it's all lies. Eat the rich. Fuck corporations.
Damn look at that monstera
I read the title as ballerina and honestly my disappointed
Dude, recalling your dreams is the BEST part !
did somebody interpret kurtis' 'pissing the bed on purpose' dream yet?
😂😂 dude there's no way these douchebags do that shit every morning. Also, I didn't you lived in Toronto😀 I'm from there! Thanks for mentioning Canada lol
Will the Kurtis Connor routine help me grow out my mustache or nah because I’m not about to move for two minutes for nothing
5:50 Billionaires don’t have normal lungs confirmed? They only do their days breathing in the morning… efficient
some time ago I tried the cold showers too and I found that going slowly from warm to cold makes your body get used to it and warm up slowly. Stop once you start being way too cold and get out
8:08. 8:51. 9:44
this is one of my favourite Kurtis vids
Jeezuz. I'm have to get up at like 3 am to be able to do all that shit in the morning. This is for people who don't have to be anywhere in the day.
How do you feel about rich dad poor dad?
Billionaries: "They're all old white people." Nay, they're mostly all white men
The pause in “I’m sure my mental health could be.. uh.. better” really summed it all up
Dang, your alpha breath? It stinks. 😤
light yagami: 9:10
Why would they call it brain training and not braining
We have the same blender
ALPHA BREATHING, I'M CACKLING
i need some dreams buff to interpret every single one of kurts dreams in embarrassing detail
kurtis' mullet looks better than ever his mustache too btw
Alpha breathing bit was hilarious. Now I know the "a" in asthma stands for alpha.
The only way Elon Musk is lookin out for the little guy is by making sure no children escape the cobalt mine
WHAT DOES YOUR ART DO????? the t is driving me crazy
Isn't it weird that Curtis is funny all on his own, but still relies on slurping sound effects for a cheap laugh. Omfg stop it, please. I wanna like these videos.
But when those people actually work? If I had to do all those things first thing in the morning it will take me until noon.
I love this
I saw a person on twitter saying once that they almost pissed their bed bc they had a dream in which they called "restaurant" (restaurante) "almoceiro" (something like luncheria)
actually love the idea of blasting the thomas the tank engine theme every morning, thanks kurt
Nah bro the playing field is even, its just most people are ignorant and make stupid decisions early in life that by there own choices lead to them not being successful. Generational poverty is a thing. Let's not try and make this a race issue. Those that want to be successful need to do things that will make them successful. Elon Musk works 7 days a week for 16hours a day, this is why he is a billionaire. How many are actually willing to put in that much time for there job each week?? And why does he make more than those that actually make the product?? He takes more risk. He owns the factory, he has to pay the employees, he is fully responsible and susceptible to lawsuits if something were to happen with his products. Basically, he risks a lot more than the employees. He also offers and brings more value to the company than a factory worker. It is a very simple system, you get paid based on the value you bring to the company and are rewarded for the amount of risk you endure
My brain does the exact same thing at 16:02 at least once a day😭just short-circuits
I have cold showers cause I don't have a choice 🤷 water heaters are a luxury in my country and heating up water at the stove takes too long
Chop the mullet shave the mustache
ХОРОШ!!!!
This was an epic video kurt, great job. I almost choked on my cantaloupe when you described the dream you had of pissing on the bed.
I don’t think billionaires make "I hardly knew her" jokes so..let’s see how This goes
As abstract as dreams can be, they are definitely your brain processing deep seated thoughts and concerns. Your doctor dream is just you subconsiously worried about your health, Thank your brain for putting it into absurdist surreal humour context :D
Have to leave a dislike on this one for you, bud; the reason you should not body-shame people (even the literal scum of the Earth) is because your insults will only hurt the feelings of completely innocent people who happen to share those traits. There are disabled people with unevenly sized eyes and lots of people with off-color teeth in the world and most of them are members of the exploited working class. Just some things to keep in mind... these words aren't going to hurt your target's feelings, they're going to hurt the feelings of other people who don't deserve to have their appearances mocked.
KOmrade Conner <3
But Kurtis, only *real* Alpha males bury their feelings deep inside to pick and choose which ones they let themselves feel.
17:37: It's not that billionaires have time to waste, but you would be doing this early in the morning. Not at 8, but more like 4, 5, or 6 in the morning. Rich people tend to wake up early. Getting an early start on you day is the best way to be productive because you're already awake before more of the sleeping world. For example: A reason why rich people in the US and Canada wake up so early is  because Wall Street opens at 8 AM. If you live on the West Coast of the USA, and sleep in until 8, Wall Street has been open for about 3 hours. They're making decisions on your life, and you was asleep. So waking up at 8 AM is not idea for rich people and anyone who is running a business. You gotta be up before the world starts turn. That way, you're already ready.
this video concept looks bad, but im gonna leave a like and leave it playing at home whilst i get some cocoa butter : ^ )
Kurtis your videos are always so long and interesting and actually full of CONTENT. <3
Yesss this was hilarious
Yes the horny list  How many shades will it be 😈😈😈
we literally made the same face at the thought of a cold shower
Kurtis: cold showers are gonna suck :((( Me, knowing full well Ontario had an “extreme cold warning” all week last week: 😬
I want that t-shirt
The fucking stroke after the hot tea has me in shambles
"they made a cats movie already? Wow I gotta watch that."  DO IT PLEASE. WE NEED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.
i'm sorry but when he said he made a brain smoothie out of brain berries i got really scared.... it was giving "victorian rich people eating grave-robbed egyptian mummies but in 2021" then THANK GOD he was just saying "blueberries" in the weirdest way possible
here's how to do the pizza employee routine   1. your cat wakes you up at 9am, feed your cat 2. work out for like 30 minutes but only if you don't wake up feeling fucking Sore 3. don't shower, just strip from the chest up and splash a bunch of sink water on yourself 4. eat some random shit in your house 5. do every single thing you have to do in the day besides work. grocery shop, doctor's appointment, hobbies, social media, friends. once it hits 1pm you're Out Of Time 6. change for work :) go to work :) make pizza :)  7. get home at 12am and go to sleep feeling sore
Just put mct oil in your coffee and some brain flakes
I related to you so hard when he said two min of movement that is NOT my workout for the day. I was like damn Kurtis u rlly doing the most for us, it couldn’t be me this week lmaooo
Complaining about how billionaires have to much money, coming from a millionaire who makes at least 15x more than an average American. Hell yeah
Omg i love kiwi
When making the smoothie you should add: ice cubes and a vanilla protein powder. They also have powdered spinach which I think would be a much better option. You can also freeze the spinach this will allow it to break down better when in the blender. The blueberries make all other ingredients taste much better. Adding ice and protein powder is the trick.
We do not know each other, but I see you as a comrade. I love you buddy.
Congrats on your billion dollar net worth Kurtis! I didn't watch the video but I can only assume that's what happened
I enjoyed this
69k worms kurtis !
Thanks for lifting my spirits. Currently chilling in some oxys after getting my wisdom teeth removed. I got like 30 minutes of sleep last night and cried as soon as a woke up
This guy's brain must be completely swollen and heavy with juice 🤢
“okay well i didnt say a GOOD elephant” has me dying 😂😂😂
Them letters ugly!!!
thats 67k worms u have to eat
I would be completely happy if the entire rest of Kurtis’ career is videos of him bodyshaming billionaires for 30-40 minutes.
"I feel like we are our state and our emotions"... As a person with Borderline, therapy told me the opposite 😂 "you are not your feeling!" so... I need a billionaires morning routine for bpd please 🤣🤣🤣 because this would set anyone with borderline up for failure 🤓😂
11:54  KURTIS YOU DIDNT
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I LOVE UR HAIR SM
Half of your opposite morning routine is just me at age 7. Listening to my brother watch Thomas the Tank Engine at full blast first thing in the morning while I contemplate every mistake I've ever made? Yep. Cosmic brownies and Mountain Dew eaten in some way it's not supposed to be? Yep. Etc., etc.
This might be the funniest video yet
The Asher Roth dream made me lose it
The journal is so wholesome lol
Thats allota worms my guy
They just want you to spend time “trying to become a billionaire” instead of actually challenging the way things are
Another great underdog movie that reminds me of this movie is "The air up there" with kevin bacon. I think you guys would really enjoy it.
kurtis dont watch the cats movie just dont
This video in particular was stupid as f*ck, but I think there is always a problem with these kinds of "recipes" for success, happiness, etc. We're all different people, and things that work for one person may not work for another. All these ideas impose one model of life, routine or whatever, when really each one has their own way of doing things that help them feel good or go through the day. Not even the same person might have the same needs in different moments of their life. During lockdown my life, work and mental state changed a lot so I had to adapt to that, and let go of things that I could do before (like going to the gym everyday) to make place for other that I needed to not just feel like absolute crap everyday.
"wish i got- i- wish i- coul- i rathe- you know"  - A Billionaire
16 missed calls.  Take us with you to the supermarket!!!! Loved this video. Can't wait to start the morning routine suggested by you.
hey Kurtis, i'm also in lockdown and am a super successful and make loads of cash. im in ontario too. lets be super rich together and buy exotic cats and shit
I will only be taking grindset advice from Kiwi and Kiwi alone
I work at Panera. I don’t understand people who get the Apple or chips.. like you’re a psychopath if you don’t get the French baguette you ducking tweaker.

kurtis' million dollar routine was a joke but that's scarily close to what i already do sdjfgsdfgh i don't know what this says about me and i actively don't wanna know
based
considering that 9-5 is probably still the most popular work schedule, the “get rich by morning routine” tips are pretty much unattainable for a lot of people. for example, going off by my experience with my weekend job, i would have to wake up at 5-5.30 just so I could do the 2 hour routine and factor in the necessary travel time to get me to work.
This was such a great video i laughed so much AND i am now allowed to body shame billionaires!
Kurtis just shrugging after going "I am bodyshaming. What are you gonna do about it?" is KILLING me
Kurtis fr a hater🤣
His dreams might be the funniest part of this video. Lost it when he started listing them from his phone OMG.
KURTIS YOUR VIDEO IS CURRENTLY ON 69k LIKES
My dude, I laughed so hard to this it should not be allowed. And I watched it at a cafe whilst eating a waffle. Was not a pretty sight. 🤣
commie kurtis is being unlocked
Kurtis is such a girlboss... such a material gworl...... my love for him grows bigger everyday...
I recently had a dream where I wrestled an aggressive ham. If I can just decode that I shall have all the money.
my morning routine is have coffee and shit and i think thats great
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Hope everyone else also tried to breathe along with the alpha breathing guy lmao
This one had no right to be this funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I haven't laughed this hard in a while!! Great one 🙌
You’re wrong Kurtis, 2022 is a prequel to 2023.
Regardless of how much money I would ever have, drinking three glasses of liquids in the morning will literally have me pissing for the rest of that day
As a chubby person, I actually do take coldish showers? My mom keeps our house at 76° fucking Farenheit so I take lukewarm showers that I gradually turn down to slightly cold. If I am not cold when I lay down in bed with intent to sleep, I will not fall asleep for HOURS. 🤷 I'm also a Taurus/Gemini cusp, so tells you how much you can trust me
He drinks THREE WHOLE DRINKS in the morning. Jesus.
the amos diggory reference omg
kurtis mullet is growing so well and becoming as long as my schlong🛁
Maybe next week you can spend 20 minutes in the morning to take down your christmas tree.
YAAAAASSSSJDJDJBD
Remembering my dream about how a little man who could shapeshift into a usb drive came into my house and robbed me is gonna make me so rich just you wait.
I cannot think of anything more disgusting than drinking straight up WATER having just woken up. Why not delicious tea?
Did you know that the guy that coined the terms alpha and beta to describe the chain of power in a pack later discovered that wolves don't actually have a patriarchal chain of power and that their packs are just parents and their kids where the mum and dad are equal :) he tried taking his original book off the shelves and replacing them with his new book stating how his original theory was incorrect but everyone had already latched onto the idea of alpha and beta pretty hard by that point so it made 0 difference. Either way, the idea of alpha and beta has always been 100% false and all the alpha males are Hella stupid for making it their full identity without even researching it.
I had a dream where my toilet exploded because my brother's friend was trying to grill a steak. The next night, I had a dream where there were these little tiny bugs that looked like cats aside from having wings and little bug mouths that were trying to bite my toes.  The only way you'd have dreams that are just processing the day is if you weren't even human. But, then again, billionaires do sacrifice their humanity by exploiting workers, so I suppose it makes sense.
THE ROCK REFERENCE TOOK ME OUT 😭
Are those Canadian blueberries
Did we not get an extra greeting?😀
His house is SO nice?!
"you're allowed to body shame a billionaire" I know this is just a joke but still, not really because there are other people who arent billionaires and who are good people who maybe share those same facial/body features so when you shaming someone for idk, having a big nose thats not hurting them but EVERYONE who has a big nose.
So I have to leave at 7:45 in the morning and I get back home at 20:00, so with a 2,5 hr morning routine and a minimum of 6 hours of sleep, that leaves me 3 hrs and 15 mins to eat, clean my home and myself and buy brain tea and brain smoothie ingredients. That's technically doable, but like, really?
That’s my boy!!
First step: I make a billion dollars
Worms in dreams are actually pretty significant. Usually means some sort of negative energy. So if your doctor is mad at you for eating too many worms in your dreams it could be  your subconscious trying to signal to you that you're consuming too much negativity (worms) and the doctor represents the need for positive mental and social wellbeing like you were saying you needed in the beggining of the video.    Sometimes though eating worms can mean a triumph over the negative too though so I guess the whole thing is arbitrary.
Okay so the three things you want to accomplish is actually very helpful for a lot of people and it doesn’t have to be three literal tasks you do everyday but for example when you work at McDonald’s it can be 1. Take responsibility over keeping an area tidy without being asked 2. Violentere to do a chore that hasn’t been done in a while (like clean the McFlurry machine) an 3. Make smalltalk outside of rush hour (if you have trouble with chitchatting for example. The goals you set or the things you choose don’t HAVE to be for bettering the company, especially if you have little connection to where you work. But setting little daily goals like this and succeeding in it, makes you feel more accomplished at the end of the day and can be used to work on the things you want to work on for yourself. Which overtime wil actually improve your well-being hopefully and make your life better/ give you a better feeling about where your life is going
Kurtis has never had a smoothie before
It's plausible that billionaires do actually have morning routines like this, but they didn't get rich that way. What you really want is their routine when they were still a millionaire, on their way to becoming a billionaire. I guess it would be something like "6am, wake up, drink coffee, start working, then work until 8pm". Elon musk used to sleep in the office at Tesla, wake up, start working, then eventually go to sleep on the floor of the office. Now he's a billionaire he doesn't do that any more, he probably gets up and self actualises a salad and communes with a blueberry smoothie.
Mr mayor, u need to breathe with your belly, not your chest and neck.
Yes make more like this!
When tf does he wash his face and brush his teeth and get dressed tf?
"This isn't a morning routine for people who want to become billionaires, this is a morning routine for people who already are billionaires". Bingo! That's ALL the "get rich" advice out there. It requires you to have resources already. Same with investment tips (don't even get me started on NFTs): they're not gonna make you a billionaire unless you have at least a few hundred millions already to actually invest.
Thank you!
18:54 Me when I see Kurtis' moustache
You know, since you've been keeping a dream journal for a whole week how about try to lucid dream? It's a pretty nice experience and it can happen if you recall your dreams, like this your hard work might not go to waste! Well, thanks for the awesome video Kurtis!
A waterfall shower Kurtis?! Are you sure you’re not already a billionaire?
That Jeff bezos eyeball joke was so underrated
okay but now you most definitely gotta make a video of you roasting rich old guys
Making the bed is a great way to save the lives of billions of bacteria that would've otherwise died from exposure and sunlight if you hadn't protected them with a blanket all day.
That’s a lot of brains
"Today, I wanna be a tourist in Morocco. Ahhhhhh it feels good to have such a superb work ethic. I'll be thru this to-be-list in no time!"  Side note: where the hell are you supposed to put your tongue other than under your front teeth? Who says that? What kind of IQ do you need to unironically say something so stupid?
They take cold showers bc generally they live where it's warm enough to; when I lived in Asia it was SO HOT in summer that cold showers were awesome, but back in western Europe it's uh,,, you know, sometimes it's hot enough to be refreshing, but I don't imagine it will be fun at all in Canada lol
This is brilliant work. 👍
It’s definitely okay to body shame billionaires!!! 😂 😂
The guy sounds like 85% Cody Ko
Well the majority of the billionaires can contribute the majority of their success to being rich from birth, and the powerful friends and impressive education that come with that. Even though they like to pretend its all self determination and hard work.
Love how this is a vid about morning routines and I just woke up at 13:03 because of severe depression lol
I had to walk to work in three snow this morning been laughing the whole walk thanks mayor kurtis that's a morning routine
9:50 human boo-ings
This is the worst thing I've ever watched. Thank you Kurtis, gonna have a brainsleep right now.
Your completely incomprehensible sentence after drinking the tea and then “ya know?” made me laugh so hard, thank you!
i 100% believe that billionaires listen to the thomas the tank engine theme song at full blast for 20 minutes every morning how else would they be like that
I really enjoyed this video, would love to see more these kind of videos :D
kiwi i love you
i had a dream lastnight that one of the participants at the place i work was my little brother.... what is my subconscious tryna fix ?? me not havin enough brothers?? i haVE TWO ALREADY N THEYRE PLENTY
the third dream means you probably had to pee in the middle night and your brain also thinks it's kinda funny and taboo to pee the bed. Were you laughing while peeing? lol I ask bc I've had similar dreams. (I'm mostly joking about my replies but I'm also a stoner so I'm dead serious as well)
this is my favorite video ever. him adjusting every single thing is absolutely me.
when i first read the title i thought it was "living as a ballerina" and got so excited haha
the second dream was about priorities.
Holy moly your videos are such quality. Just, thank you
Why is no one talking about the breathing oh my god 😭
kurtis for fucks sake if you don't put some honey in those damn smoothies
I'd like to address what Kurtis said about an "even playing field"? That is actually a _zoning issue_  ... so thank you...
meditation really helps with mental health, but not everyone likes being still for 20 minutes so you can just find what's best for you, for me it's doing yoga for 10 or 5 minutes or just dancing hehe
Yo Kurtis's place is so nice, that showerhead??
Trying to plan my emotions for the day with BPD lol
you are what you eat, you dream is telling you that you are a worm, and your doctor was just confirming it. (watch the movie The Stoned Age...worm)
Can I interpret your dream? A doctor is typically a person's advice you'd respect. But this doctor believes worms are important to your health. Health can mean status. I think your brain just randomly vented about the proverbial worms you're eating to maintain your status in something important to you, even though you never had to "eat worms" before
Spinidge
20:22 is that ????? jacob????
the breathing exercise thing gave me so much anxiety
Hearing kurtis  call billionaires “losers” fed something deep in me that I didn’t know I needed
tAke CAre oF ur SKin MYGUY! iTs NOt ThaT hrd.
Kurtis Conner cannot make a smoothie
I love keeping track of the dreams I have. I'm a very internal kind of person though. I love going back through them and noticing patterns and connections to my stress levels etc. It's also fun seeing which ones actually end up being prophetic 😂
So cool!!!!!!
i litteraly cried laughing this is fucking hilarious
Did anyone else hate how he made the smoothies? The video he got it from sounded like he was naming different kinds of smoothies, not the ingredients to one singular smoothie. And where was the ice!? This bothered me more than it should have.
"To be or not to be list" got me lol
I am not a billionaire
Kurtis either looks like he hasn’t slept in years or like he just woke up from the best nap
istg rich ppl "morning routines" are just capitalistic superstition 👀
I do have regular morning routines. I wake up, watch youtube and make some food
This was one of the funniest videos I've seen in a while!! Please more of random stuff like this 🥺
Kurtis pronounces "spinach" as "spinage" LMAO
Morning routines definitely aren’t “1 size fits all” and these billionaires/social media influencers will have you thinking you’re doing so wrong in life because you didn’t get up at 4am to meditate and come up with phrases like “we’re not human doings, we’re human beings” 🤮 A productive morning is great, but some of us live in working class reality 🙄
Best kurtis video so far! Liking 2022 already xD
Why haven't you changed the name of your fanbase to Kurt-munnity? Ya know, like the Kurtis community...eh...? (No Canadian pun on the "eh", btw)
very funny very good
When you first took the sip you looked like a kid who was forced to eat a carrot 💀💀💀
kurtis conner? more like curtis konner.
I make that smoothie every morning and its great! You just didnt put enough water! And add some honey
Kurtis, this may be uncalled for, but watching you breath whilst smiling I noticed you might have TMJD. Thus your cracking bones. Just fyi. It fucking sucks if it no treated in a timely manner. I can tell.
feel like I have valid reasons for getting an apple at panera
I laughed so much on the alpha breathing part...you nailed it Kurtis 😂
This man's morning routine sounds like it would take five fucking hours to do
I did enjoy the somewhat vlog style video, wouks love to see more kurtis tries
wheres my extra greetinggggggggg 😭😭😭
So the be a billionaire you have to almost die every morning?
Kinda looks like he has a little hitler stache on top of a normal mustache. Its like thicker or darker right in the middle and its distracting lol.
Śmieszne
I physically can’t fucking breathe with my top on the roof of my mouth 💀
Um I think this video will just be my morning routine so thanks Kurtis!
The issue with body shaming is that it's not just Jeff Bezos youre mocking, youre saying its a bad feature which is hurtful to everyone who looks like that
Instead of breathing first I understood grieving and I thought: That sounds like it's going to make your day terribly sad but maybe it works?
you have to eat 60 thousand worms now kurtis. what will happen to the ecosystem? you have no symptahy
Lol this video really made me laugh I feel like the billionaires who do this billionaire morning routine just stole all of their ideas from TickTock none of what I have heard from these billionaires is anything original Kurtis is right they are losers lol
Kurtis, you have such a nice place. Love the plants everywhere
‘Today you feel nothing’
God I wish universal unconditional basic income was a thing
bro the speaker guy is worth 2 million dollars, still a lot of money but not a billionaire
I always write down my dreams(I dont dream super often) not because of that bs but because they are fuggin nuts and I like reading them/telling them to friends
When The Guy said brain smoothie and I saw the red smoothie in the video I thought he was a serial killer that used peoples brains to drink
can someone PLEASE make a video using kurtis's morning routine PLEASE that shit would be comedy GOLD
Only serial killers genuinely enjoy cold showers 🚿
Socialist Kurtis, Let's Fucking Gooo
ASDGH that death note moment omg 😂😂😂
i love these types of videos so much, it keeps me entertained while i do other stuff
It's kind of funny and sad that people buy into the words these old, white, rich men say. Like okay 👍🏼😀
4:31 OBVIOUSLY THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF WORMS IS ZERO, KURTIS, SHAKING SMH MY HEAD 😂🤣😂🤣
Jenna please get him to shave the 'stache 🥲
I just realized that routine didn't include brushing your teeth. Kind of explains Warren.
Sure, Jeff Bezos has a big eye, Warren Buffett has nasty teeth, but fortunately for them, I know of a fun little contraption that takes care of the whole head. Just one little yoink of a lever, and there it goes.
tbh kurtis' shower looking sleek, maybe its because of the alpha breathing 😫
But when does he brush his teeth 😢
Drinks brain tea and has a how to be human list. Obviously not suspicious. Now a brain smoothie. Im thinking high functioning zombie or ware wolf
I had a dream I killed ninja and was on the run what am I solving there?
This is my new favorite video honestly
Gotta say, always love seeing Kurtis being a comrade.
Why is there so many bots in the replies of people comments-
Watching this in public was a bad idea😂😂
Can I just say omg I HATE how non English people make tea, yes I’m British but that is irrelevant. PUT MILK IN IT AND SUGAR AND USE NORMAL TEA BAGS
Kurtis you look like the guy at the library that downloads 3TBs of Serbian porn onto the library’s computers
yus
My morning routine involves waking up and drinking coffee and watching a Kurtis conner video before heading to work.
i dunno if its a habit from when i used to swim but taking cold showers is kind of underrated. like not ice cold but cool water is rly nice even in winter bc you dont get cold when you leave the shower? like ur already adjusted?? to the cold?
I agree on the cold showers being the worst, but I do encourage anyone to try a hot and cold shower: just do your regular hot shower first, and after that turn the water cold or barely warm and rinse yourself with that.
Your dream about eating worms means exactly what you've said in the beginning of the video. You're not taking care of your health too much, putting "wrong" things inside your body. It could have been a joke, but it most likely isn't
thanks kurtis when i passed out doing THE real billioner dollar morning routin i had a vision of very profitable set up and now im on ForBEs
Yessssss
I have to defend cold showers but also explain it. I think calling it a "cold" shower makes people assume it has to be hurting you . It should be cool not perfect cold, like slightly in the cool setting. Not freezing. Think of it like stepping into a nice pool. It's not hot but not freezing. You do it at a comfortable temp and let it wake you up. It doesn't have to be all at once either. It's supposed to be refreshing
Choked on my tall glass of water during the 2 minute movement commercial.
It just sounded like a list adults would tell me to get over my ADHD
What the fuck is up with half the comments on this video??  Also, I've seen way too many people sucking the balls of the billionaires in the comments as well. Dude. Kurtis told us, you're allowed to body shame billionaires.  You don't have to lick their bumholes anymore.
Cold showers suck i think i'd cry if i had to shower with cold water for like 30 seconds
If you for whatever reason wanna retry making that smoothie, try adding ice and apple juice instead of the water 👌
Are Jenna and Kurtis dating or something 😳😳?
The whole alpha thing is so cringe and based on an false observation of wolves that aren’t accurate and straight boys just lap it up. It’s bs. Rich people love to push that capitalist mindset of meritocracy which can’t be applied to everyone . And how they measure success is a capitalist one. Have money and material things is prioritised over happiness and love for others
Literally cackling
jfc no where in the US is doing a "lockdown"... must be nice :,)
This video was so helpful for me as an aspiring billionaire. I'll be following the REAL billion dollar morning routine that will change my life~
dang ur alpha breath stinks
the breathing parts are actually so unsettling
Dumbest shit ever. I roll out of bed four minutes late for work, dehydrated as fuck, throw a cup of water in microwave, dump too much instant coffee in, dump too much sugar in, take my medicine on an empty stomach, and fucking succeed bro.
I didn't finish the video yet. I'm too busy screaming because my therapist told me to do so many of these things on the list. 😭 Like sure it was nice but to do it everyday? Okay
Eating worms in your dream simbolizes you taking on negative feelings/actions and internalizing them. Your doctor telling you you're eating *too many* worms can mean that your subconcious is repelling these negative feelings and telling you to work through them.  You lost me at pissing the bed tho
i kinda have that dudes morning rountine, as in, write down what i dreamt (if i can remember), make bed and then go and sit on a chair and stare out of the window for 13 minutes while drinking water and cuddling my dog, so that i dont doomscroll from the first moment i am awake on. But thats just to keep me decently sane, im still broke lol  edit: kinda didnt think this "routine" would go on after breathing did i eh
👍
We are extremely appreciative of your kindness Mr. Mayor. We would never want to actually experience the monstrosity you just endured for our entertainment. All hail the mayor 🙌
dang ur alpha breath stinks
This video makes my brain dry and I live it
Cold showers are the best, but also, you live in Canada, I live in Texas, so that might have something to do with it
tomorrow morning i'm going to RECALL my DREAM (nightmare) of those god awful cursed alpha breathing segments
+1 More videos like this please
i like how he doesn't know about the nintento game called fucking "brain training"
loved that video and that style of content
the last bit killed me
Kurtis has my dream shower
He kurtis you brought my relationship back together for tn
15:50 trash swiss cheese plant 👎
I had a dream last night that I was brushing my teeth and looked down and my sink had to randomly fallen to pieces without any noise and without me noticing. Billionaire potential right there ✨
Doctor's say probiotics are a scam.
smoothies should not be with water, they suck like that, any plant milk is better for a smoothie than water
loved this video!!!
Clapping with Kurtis after "folks" always brings me joy.
Billionaire? I hardly know her
Elon is the only good billionaire and actually seems humble about his money. And I'm not even an Elon fanboy
2:06 of course Im not going to stand up for Jeff with the amount of money he has he can hire agent 47 to take down Kurtis in case he felt offended
I only ever take cold showers on the mega-hot days in summer. Otherwise, they suck and I don't know why people think they're good.
only poor people wil follow that routine and that's what the billionaire's want
dang your alpha breath stinks
If you were stressing about not being able to finish work on time just do less of it.
1 more worm, 61k worms and counting...
dang ur alpha breath stinks
as a mcdonalds employee i kinda just make two drinks, and take one order then go
ontario gang
dang ur alpha breath stinks
i just had the best 30 minutes of my life
Billionaires: Recall your dreams. they mean something.  My dreams: 9:11
You pissed the bed instead of shit it so like… not as bad but only by the measurement of how you feel about piss being on a bed. Not your bed though. That’s your dream interpretation. You’re welcome.
Oh9hohhh
kurtis went from lowkey leftist to highkey leftist with this video
the intro was so funny, i definitely need a whole video of kurtis making fun of rich old white guys.
u should straighten your hair lol. you would look like...really silly.
please don't watch the cats movie
As someone who has lived in subtropical conditions, that is what cold showers are made for. Cannot imagine that in a snowy climate 🥶🥶
can you make a video of insulting billionaires? that would be great
That first part really hit hard. "Maybe it'll be different because it will be worse". Started this year with surgery, followed by a healthy and strong dosage of catching COVID-19. Maybe I need to start living that Billionaire lifestyle, then I can just dream this COVID away. 🤙
Damn, Capricorn season hit Kurty fr fr
Looked up the speaker and his net worth is only $2mil what a fake
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Booooo hello fresh sponsorship 👎 they are actively anti-union and gave out masks that said "say no to union dues" in Spanish to their Spanish speaking employees. Fuck them and don't support exploitative garbage companies
Try adding some ice next smoothy
dude be a pal and drop the link to that sweater you’re wearing at the end
Am I billionaire material? Because I literally do everything this guy does?!  Except fuck that brain smoothie lol But I am on a journey to start my own farm to table restaurant... 👀
When you were explaining the real billion dollar morning routine I actually had to pause the video to catch my breath from laughing so hard
kurtis.... hello fresh is currently union busting.... i wanna support you and i know sponsoring vids is a good way to make money, but i hate seeing you support a company that's actively trying to suppress its workers
Hey kurtis! I actually interpret dreams professionally! The dream about pissing the bed actually means you really really want to piss the bed.
I like these longer types of videos. Pretty cool!
cold showers in Canada?
my immune system is so shit that after trying to take a cold shower ONCE i instantly got sick and had a fever for 3 days
Would be so much more believable if the motivation was to be healthy, instead of rich.
i love when you make these types of videos they are always so funny,
Ironic he mocks Jeff Bezos then does an ad read for Hello Fresh
Actually, I want to know WHO said mullets looked good
I want to know WHO said mullets are cool
freud would tell you that pissing on the bed means you have a pissing kink
<3 yay based kurtis
I hope you watch the cats movie.
Starting off 2022 strong! Loved this video
oh god this is hilarious
I would watch kurtis roasting billionaires for an hour or two
Does he know it's spinach and not spinaj? Lolol
What's wrong with your moustache
kurtis looks like the way my dad in the 90s except if he respected women
18:41 that def tastes like sadness
Isn't saying 'you allowed to body shame billionare' kind of the same as' if man and woman are equal does it means I can hit girls?' In one of your videos you were so quick to say that if you think like this you should go to therapy but now you're like' so what you are gonna defend a billionare.? ' Couldn't it  be possible to make the argument that it is the same with race, gender, age or disability? Sure these people are propably terrible humans beings but they are not gonna hear what you said but people who are watching you will. Just because someone is a horrible person it doesn’t mean all bets are off. Or in another instance you've said that if you are unable to make jokes about anything other  but about  how woman are the worst you should't do stand up. Being  unable to make jokes about anything the person did and  just going straight to poking fun at his apperance seems similar to me. It is a lame joke and even worse additude.
kurtis in the  morning looks like live action luigi
Your dream about the worms means you're eating too much trash and are subconsciously ashamed of it
You brazenly body-shaming billionaires has unlocked yet another door in my niche-things-that-turn-me-on mansion
Constantly lucid dreaming can actually be bad sometimes because your sleep isn’t as restful
your dream probably means, take less bullshit. 😁
"dear diary, I want to feel happy today."
We love a non-class traitor
My brain kept saying to add more water to the smoothie and then just: water conner water conner water conner. Kurtis Water, Water Conner, god my brain is malfunctioning help
my morning routine is literally hitting my vape and taking a shit
I made the mistake of watching this at 2am and that intro almost woke my girlfriend up lol
BINGO HALL OF FAME  I'm dead
I miss the extra greeting 😓
This is one of your best videos, not only I laughed once, I laughed multiple times
Breathing part was the best part.
Yes
KIWI CONTENT
Love this video Mr Mayor great job
Today, you feel nothing
This was a great video
I mean no offence by what Im about to say but I feel like lot of the times you tend to brush things off as stupid or pointless just because  you didn't take the time to research the benifits of the exercises. I agree with the points you made about how long and  overly strict the rutine is but lot of the things you didn't like you didn't actually understood why they might be helpfull or at least it seemed like it. Like with the to feel list. Writing out positive things you want to experience could be really beneficial for people who strougle with mental health and need reminders of the good things in life. Or the to be list could help people make the active decision to act acording to their values and not by default. I feel when you label these things as cringy you are dismissing these tools. I think you didn't diferanciate between the way the speakers put it and what they were actually saying. Other than that, really funny video. Had a good laugh.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I must be an opposite billionaire cus I got that in the bag babeyyy 😎 ~depression~
I would love if sir conner made a full video making fun of rich people
18:00 Hey Kurtis that's not a smoothie... that's a lumpy! ha ha get it? thank you I'll be here all week.
More of these videos!
i sexually identify as a nokia flip phone
For real, though... Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is my jam.
Kurtis Conner, heh, more…  more like… Kurtis Billionaire
You're actually not supposed to make your bed right after you wake up, you're supposed to air it out first. Also you should take your supplements with food because some vitamins are only properly absorbed when combined with fat.
lmao he looks so fucking nerdy. Mullet, mustasche and curls. Love it.
Are you ok?
*what dat mean*
Meditation is less about thinking and more about clearing your mind, at first,falling asleep is sorta normal but then as you practice you get better at just sitting in the present
How dare you put Cedric Diggory's death in a video about being our best selves!  Now I'm journaling about how that made me feel! 🤧😪🤧
I remember going to run two blocks to watch people at a panera at 6:00 AM as a morning routine during high school. I told people I did that, but I only pulled it off like 4 times.  People believing in you even though you know full well you don't deserve the respect is the kind of confidence boost every high schooler needs.  Bonus points if you aren't involved in sports
hi just wanted to share that my left eye is much larger than my right eye so thanks for that
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The intro is too damn relatable with the exception that I don't live in Ontario and my country refuses to go into another lockdown 😄
He’s starting to look like that other Canadian YouTuber who talks about flags, I just forgot who 💀
Is alpha breathing just hissing?
Omg everyone is talking about kurtis being a millionaire. I’m so fucking proud of him ✅💲
Best Kurtis video in recent history! very funny indeed...
We’re not human doings, we’re human beings is totally a joke Kurtis would’ve said
This was an awesome video DO MORE
I think you probably should watch cats. Because it is a waking nightmare, a literal fever dream. Deeply psychedelic and unfortunately horrifying. You should watch cats.
kurtis is so hot when he dismantles capitalism
Oh shit his Awakening is incoming, prepare for vegan jogger Kurtis till the end of 2022
Widely unknown, but cold showers would actually make you more sleepy, because it reduces your body temperature, putting it in a rest state. So in the same logic, you should actually take a hot shower in the morning to wake you up
I prefer Thomas The Frank Engine but ill try this thanks
Amazing video
👍
holy fuck if i had to wake up 2 hours earlier just to do this shit before work i would be so tired. and having a small smoothie for breakfast?? how am i supposed to work if i have nothing in my stomach?? rich people have no idea how real life works.
I'm sorry, you know 96 Quite Bitter Beings???????
there’s so much lore in the alpha universe
All I can see is kurtis’ mustache looking like two caterpillars kissing 🥲
nice! the video is trending
Brain trainer? I BARELY KNOW HER
the "billion dollar morning routine" straight up looks exactly like kingpin's morning routine in daredevil LMAO
“ontario is in ANOTHER lockdown”  This dude’s country lets him have LOCKDOWNS??
the kurtis billioinaire routine just sounds like the way your average Midwesterner lives.
The cold water does help wake you up but an entire shower wild cold water isn't necessary. For anyone that wants to try, less than a minute should work!
Most unproblematic and based creator i follow
KURTIS YOU LOOK HOT WITH THE MULLET AND MUSTACHE NEVER GET RID OF IT
💕
the kurtis aproved billinaire routine unironically sounds suck as fuck.i love cosmic brownies and hate water.
whoa I can't wait to do the real billionare morning routine B)
I’m a student, this routine would make me wake up literally at 4 in the morning… all for a cold shower  No way in hell am I doing that
Kurtis you can’t make fun of Jeff bezos and then be sponsored by hello fresh 😩😩
I subscribed for a second greeting. Where is my second greeting, Kurtis?
Fun fact. Inflation has decreased the value of the dollar by 7 cents. That means that someone that has 200 billion dollars now only has 186 billion. They lose 14 billion dollars without even doing anything to cause it. They care about inflation.
i dreamed last night that kurtis died. and i cried like a little bitch
Could Curtis look any more Canadian ??
is that a founding father
Omg thank you for making this because I try to follow these type of routines, and I get so tired and drained that I feel like I literally want to go back to sleep before I even technically “start” the day 😩
This is my favorite video so far since the ealry Curtis, fr, cry my self laughing  hahajaj
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis hating smoothies and Sudoku...I feel so seen
I want more videos like this.
are we done with the extra greeting? :(
This is the morning routine for people who don't have jobs lmao
Dude that CKY song playing during the Tony Hawk shit brought me back!
Dear kurtis I liked the majoras mask cameo.
your beta routine is the funniest thing i’ve ever seen in my life
The thing about body shaming is that the billionaires won't see this. But other people with similar bodies do, and it hurts them. I'm all for taking down billionaires, I think being that rich is absolutely morally reprehensible, but I don't think body shaming is the way to go about it since it won't actually hurt them, but only hurt other people. Unless we body shame them for still having the heads that should have been guillotined of a long time ago
6:49 you messed up my breathing. I guess im a beta
LoVE THESE VIDEOSSSSSS YESSSS CREATIVE KING
the breathing technique is actually a real one that's supposed to help with anxiety (it's called 4-7-8 breathing)
Total concentration breathing alpha form 1
Gonna have to wake and and contemplate my new nightmares about alpha breathing
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The good partner elephant part could've been a Vine
Hey Kurtis, this video is absolutely hilarious and I understand your point. These billionaires don't truly understand the struggle of the working class and I think the concept of a billionaire shouldn't even fucking exist.. However, some of what he does in this routine is stuff I've learned in therapy. He comes off as pretentious but I wouldn't discount everything he is saying. And you don't need to do every one of these every day; just picking one or two could help someone.  --Rituals and routines are important for mental stability--people with ADHD or ASD often love having routines or rituals. Decision fatigue is a literal psychological concept, and if you have a routine, you really don't have to think too much and make too many decisions.  --Recalling your dreams is pretentious but only if you're rich.  --Making your bed can help maintain some sense of order, even if you don't have the energy to do anything else. --Vitamins and probiotics are good for you but not necessary to human survival and can be expensive so L on that one. --It is SO cringe that they refer to this breathing technique as alpha breathing (also the tongue thing is weird), but I've practiced 4-8-7 breathing sans creepy smile/tongue dance on many occasions for my anxiety. It slows my heart rate and makes me feel more grounded. Breathing techniques, again, are widely encouraged (again no source but therapy patient).  --Meditation, again, a great coping mechanism to try. --1-2 minutes of just movement is a fantastic concept. It doesn't have to be insane/you don't have to exert yourself, but getting the blood flowing and stretching out your muscles after sleep can't hurt. --Cold shower? Psychopath. /j --Tea? Whatever, but honestly better than coffee. I wouldn't wish a caffeine addiction on anyone. I have a huge addiction to caffeine. --Journaling is a widely encouraged coping mechanism amongst psychologists (I don't have sources for this other from my experiences with different therapists). --To-do list of three things? If you interpret that a different way, he could be saying those are just his goals for the day and he would like to reach them throughout his day. Not that once he does all 3 things he stops doing anything. Having a small list of things may help someone create good habits without overloading them. For me, personally, I could think of call dentist to schedule appointment, read chapter 1 of my textbook, and take my meds. Small goals can be huge ones for some people. --"A lot of who we are is our states and emotions" is awesome. For someone with a mood disorder as well as anxiety/ADHD, a lot of my life has been ruled by my emotions and I let my emotions take over me. A "to-feel" list could be feasible, but not always. If you know watching puppy videos will make you a little happy, then there. Number one is to feel happy by watching puppy videos.  --Boo on the human doings. --Reading? Great habit! --Smoothies aren't a bad option but not all of those fresh foods are accessible to everyone. --Website courses bullshit.   I am aware not everyone is able bodied and not everyone has 18 hours to live out their mornings, however doing just one of these things could improve someone's mental health. What's interesting, however, is how these ideas are geared towards men--we don't refer to any of this as therapeutic, it has to be tough guy macho man shit. Why? Why do we have to smother these legitimate coping skills in testosterone in order to appeal to men? Society has taught us that men are supposed to be tough, without emotion. Maybe this is the only way to get through to them?  I'm probably overanalyzing but a lot of what he said I have learned in therapy. Sharing these techniques in a more digestible way could help someone here.
billionaires are so easy to make fun of why can't they buy themselves a personality instead of being a huge loser
This is a funny video but I think it's also good to realize that the video is actually really helpful. Doing breathing exercises, meditating, and trying to stay healthy in every way possible is the key to having a better life and hopefully stabilizing your mental health if you have problems with it.
weaaring a shirt that says 'please be nice' and then being ruthlessly mean to billionaires (as he should) is the funniest joke of the video
wait ok but is there a link to where I can get that kurtistown mug? I don't really like merch shirts or hoodies (I have the first one but I don't usually go for that) but I drink way too much coffee and collect mugs!!
Mutual Hamiltonion.....and love your genuine perspective.
Kurtis looks so cute after he wakes up wow
I love your shower
Love you dad
Took him this long to grow a mustache
ITS A HEATER THIS WEEK
oh my god the bonsai decor in the bedroom is everything
Let’s get #bodyshamebillionaires trending
kurtis: 10:47   also kurtis: 27:37
Playing tony hawk pro skater 2 till I pass out is already in my morning routine
anyone gonna explain that’s a legit psychological theory abt dreams
Personally, I like to just take a good regular hot shower and when you’re done just turn on the cold water for a min, feels real good if you like your water to peel your skin off.
ngl I do want a video of Kurtis making fun of billionaires for 30 minutes straight
I am that person who wakes up early in the morning (4am/5am) and start to make a lot of stuff around. But I do not do it by choice, my brain just doesn't wanna sleep :(  Sometimes it feels nice to have my own time and I honestly feel more productive. But I have to say that after few days I feel miserable. I get shut down for 10 to 12 hours, then repeat.  But hey, why im not still a millionaire?
Shout out to majoras mask reference
Here for the billionaire slander
Kold showers usually start off hot
mark zuckerberger
You have the cutest dog I’ve ever seen
Okay so I’ve been a dream interpreter for a few years and I’m really excited to put my skills to good use! Kurtis, that second dream you described is actually really insightful and I’ve heard similar ones many times before, so there’s no need to be ashamed :).  What it means, though, is that you’re just a wittle peepee poopoo piss boy. Hope that helped :).
The whole breathing thing do help when calming down or practicing to hold your breath longer
I laughed out loud sooo many times! This video is a banger
damn you're extra funny in this one
The and yes im body shaming will go down as one of the best youtube lines of 2022
Bots going crazy in the replies of every comment jesus christ Anyways a smoothie with avocado in it seems like it would take a miracle to taste good, and that's coming from someone who loves avocado
Kurtis “it’s soo thick” My brain “that’s what she said” 😭
I’m just getting over Covid and I almost asphyxiated laugh coughing at that worm joke.
he probably watched an actual ad 😭🤳
I laughed through the entire Beta Morning Routine it was so fucking funny omfgggg
Great video Kurti-boy! Make more. Also you gots ta eat a whole lotta wormies my guy
cats movbie review INCOMING LEZGOO
The goosebumps clip killed me
Kurtis pls make a video of u making fun of rich old guys
Kurtis, dear, that's why they call it ROUTINE it is something u do everyday and u got used to it and you are doing it without even thinking what should i do next. And when u break that routine it feels weird and even exhausting because ur brain will resist it and u have to additionally think about what to do next. so yeah it won't work in a week but some habits might get into ur own personal routine
Yessss keep ‘em cominggg
Your mullet is so pretty
the way he pronounces 'spinach' is sending me
I’m high asf so the breathing bit with the guy talking took me out omg
I am so happy CKY's song was used in this video for the tony hawk skating clip. Sick video and a sick song.
Banger video dude
26:44 someone clip that
as someone who regularly takes cold showers (i live in australia and the sun makes it too hot for regular showers sometimes) i understand that Im insane but also recommend not going whole hog on the cold, because it makes it had to breathe. like a 30:70 ratio on hot to cold is enough to be refreshing, but not so cold it makes it impossible to breathe. of course, having said that, I also fairly regularly DO go whole hog on the cold, and at this point my "hot" shower unless i have anxiety is still only lukewarm so im probably just insane
This video was a damn masterpiece, thank you for suffering to entertain us!
This one was a banger Kurt
hassle grind propaganda
✨ You can body shame billionaires as a treat ✨
When I was depressed, I would put “eat lunch,” “go to class,” and “drink 2 glasses of water” on my daily list, because when I crossed them off it helped me not judge myself for not utilizing every second of my day to better myself. That pressure was too much and I would ignore basic needs, so the “easy” list helped.
whats the name of the song playing during tony hawk
The REAL billionaire routine almost killed me from laughing before I even got a chance to try it.
Why u mad that people are rich? If anyone was in their position they wouldn’t complain or hate poor people
This dude needs to review the fnaf lore
I’m literally dead, kurtis keeps making me laugh but I have periods cramps and it freaking pains man… 👿😼😸💔
listen, I know this isn't the point but as someone who has cooked and blended spinach at various times, it's never enough spinach, you can fit a ludicrous amount of spinach into stuff before it even registers I STG (this IS hate towards spinach physics in case I wasn't clear)
kurtis’s handwriting looks exactly how I thought it would
Don’t know why they called box breathing alpha breathing (?!?!??) but it actually can be a great coping mechanism for anxiety and mindfulness 🥰
This has made me realize billionaire bros are just crystal astrology girls but with different wording
I know this isn't the point of the video but, Kurtis your house is so pretty!!
u put 96 quite bitter beings as the song and referenced THPS2 but that song was on THPS3 ... DUDE.........
The beta breathing + Thomas the tank engine theme + burning hot shower with existential crisis still seems better than the actual billionaire routine
This vid sure is a slapper. Only like a quarter through
did anyone else see the absolute cake on zuckerburg
Alpha breathing!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣idk what’s funnier the fact that it exists or the fact that there’s actually a tutorial
went to a bar with asher roth is the funniest thing i’ve heard in a long time
i really really love your hair in this vid dude
worm eating video when?
HelloFresh? More like HelloUnionBusting!
Okay but that jump scare was creepy!!!
kurtis the loose way you hold your smoothie glass concerns me
This was my favourite video so far, it was so funny! Thanks for sharing! Have a great 2022 :)
More of these types of vids please!
I laughed so many times tysm i needed this video today
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
everything the Canadian said in the beginning relates to me
seeing your videos being high is definitely an experience.
I love you curt boy
I always used to be so timid when it came to committing murder, but then I tried the alpha breathing technique and it worked like a charm! Murdering a human has never come easier!
5:00 the piss & shit joke had me cackling😭✋🏼
yeah i aint taking a cold shower even if I had that sexy ass shower. mad respekt to kurtis for doing that the entire week. this whole routine is so freakin pretentious.
yo kurt boy can you make a video about how you make videos?
4:33 Shane Madej core
I mean, I only take cold showers if I'm heated after a workout. Besides hot water bad for stressed muscles
Literally how many lists are in this guy's morning routine. He's spending half the day making lists like who has time for that
'today u fell nothing' -me everyday
So an ad for a country cowboy themed movie started playing, and I really was thinking it was one of Kurtis' extra long skits about country life until I looked back over at the video 😅
It makes me eternally happy that someone finally pointed out the Bezos fucking eyeball size discrepancy
“you’re allowed to body shame a billionaire” i want that on a T-shirt
Two thumbs up five stars way to go love this video!
WHEN YOU BURNED YOUR MOUTH ON THAT TEA 😂🤣☠⚰
Haven't there been studies showing that making your bed makes it easier for microbes to fester and thrive?
Honestly, recalling your dreams is great for the comedic value alone. Also, how can you remember any dreams?
to give the "recalk your dreams" bit a little credit, if you're like me, you will forget them as soon as you leave your bed. and if you're trying to analyze them, it might be useful? i guess?
It should be taken with a decent grain of salt, but in dream dictionaries they describe worms as a symbol of negativity, and self loathing. So maybe your brain doctor is telling you your too negative and hard on yourself? 🤷🏼‍♀️ Or maybe it's nothing, idk man
i wish i had dreams like yours
12:32 onwards, your mustache is sparkling, it's beautiful
Someone please tell me they know the song that was playing during Tony hawk segment
kurtis ur dream about the worms referred to u drinking wine as everyone knows is alcohol creates an environment for worms to grow inside ur body
Thanks. I had a really good time.  Laughed like no one was watching.  Skipped to the lou my darling.
try possum breathing: screaming out the exhale
I enjoyed this so very much
I laughed so hard so many times 🤣☠️
i couldve sworn u had brown eyes dude
the cosmic brownies killed me
22 seconds on the vid and Kurtis already made my day.
I liked just to see you eat a worm.
I feel so bad for Kurtis because you can actually make a great smoothie with avokado and spinach, it's just that all the essential ingredients that make it delicious were missing like bananas, apples, mangos, berries etc
Love the cold showers in Canadian winter
kurtis, oh my god, i can't get over how different you look straight out of bed. like i don't know why i am so surprised but holy shit
your vids just keep getting better and better
did i see an intro i dont think so although i might have missed it im fairly upset
You shouldn't be showering with cold water for the whole thing unless you're post workout or having trouble waking up. Have a normal, hot shower and rinse yourself off after with cold water! It helps stimulate your vessels, also wakes you up. Just be careful to not make the temperature change too big too fast to avoid shock, and you'll be fine and enjoying the benefits.
Kurtis you forgot to drink the tears of the poot and homeless 🙄
as an employee at panera bread that apple joke was spot on our apples arent even good half of the time
More kiwi content pls
they drink that smoothie so they may experience pain in their life too
instantly one of my favorite kurtis videos I haven't laughed this hard in weeks
I always forget that he has a girlfriend.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Fantastic vid. The body shaming bit and the anti morning routine bit were both 10/10
Yooo Kurtis, you look extra fine in this video, just so you know
Wow Kurtis your skin is glowing
“Today you feel nothing” HAHAAHHA IM DEAD
Kurtis makes me brown my pants
i think kurtis is just getting old
“Happy new year it is 2022 the sequel of 2020” Perfection.
Only YouTuber to make me actually bust out laughing! You’re a god
Surprised you haven't made a Liver King video ! 👑
*KRIS CUT YOU’RE HAIR AND SHAVE YOU’RE MUSTACHE PLZ!!!!!*
I can’t with these morning routines. I wake up and the first thing I do is check if my son has pissed through his nappy then I keep him alive all day and that’s it. That’s the routine. Good lord, imagine having time to breathe consciously.
I really appreciated the tiny "That's my boy!!!" clip of Amos Diggery yelling upon seeing Cedric's dead body, literally choked hahaha
HELPPP the breathing thing was TERRIFYING
that is the morning routine of a stoner
Normally I just silently smirk to jokes in commentary videos but this one made me genuinely laugh out loud so many times. Top tier video Kurtis🙌
this video just made me realize rich people just do what old retired people do to fill time in their day & keep active (except it's 30 year old weirdos trying to justify their giant paychecks for doing absolutely nothing)
my morning routine is actually to just get dressed and leave for work or school because I wake up 10 minutes before my shift or class starts
this routine is pretty good in theory, but like you and so many other folks have mentioned: who the hell has the time to do an extensive routine like that when you’re just a regular person
Cold showers also don't clean your hair as well. Little fun fact. Only time a shower should be cold is at the very end if you want a little shine to your hair and a little burst of alertness. That's all
alpha breathing dude sounds like salad fingers
Dang your alpha breath stinks
Ive been doing connors suggested morning routine for a month now since he posted this. Can confirm i am a billionaire now
ur alpha breath is lowk pretty stinky kurt
i actually already do your DIY real billionaire morning routine and im the richest person in the United States with a total of $0.01
shit man that alpha breathing got me relaxed as fuck
I regularly have dreams about fighting people, what do I have to fix bro
that routine is AT LEAST half a day omg
god this was so fucking funny and fun to watch
watching him breathe just remind me of an angry bearded dragon
Lol! This is so good!
My mom used to make smoothies exactly like that and would make me drink one every once in a while because it's healthy 💀 Im pretty sure she put peanutbutter in some of them
💙🤣
Where's my extra greeting, damn it?!?!?
22:34 im sorry i have to be a plant nerd. That pilea in the background is absolutely gorgeous. Its ridiculous how healthy and beautiful it is.
No offense but you literally look like an 80s porn star
The hair and moustache is giving me....... "Forsooth, verily shall I steal thy girl"
watching him not put ice in that smoothie was the most agonizing experience of my life  protip: put in a cup of ice when you're making smoothies. worked at a smoothie place for over a year and I can tell you that too little ice, let alone none at all, will completely ruin the experience because it won't blend well at all and leaves you with an awkward texture that makes you wanna throw up
Cold therapy?¿?
i aspire for my future house to be decorated like yours
was the billionaiire guy using imovie for his video?? can he not afford final cut pro or something lmao??
In my dreams, huskies lay eggs and Im trying to persuade myself that huskies do actually lay eggs and I can buy one and it will hatch into a husky, I did end up buying a husky egg.
KURTIS I KNOW IT'S A NEW YEAR AND TIMES ARE TOUGH AND ALL BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE US TWO GREETINGS.  YOU CAN'T SURPRISE ME LIKE THAT I'M SENSITIVE 😱😭
Bro y’all’s house is so fucking nice with the plants and the browns and greens and paintings and shit
dang ur alpha breath stinks :/
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SONG WAS PLAYING DURING THE TONY HAWK PART???? I know it but can't remember any lyrics and its killing me!
I had my fingers crossed that you were going to say we don’t have to read but COME ON DUDE
he chewed it. he chewed the smoothie.
We have the same water filter
that dog is so beautiful i love him
Excellent video! I think you're spot on when you called it “hustle-mindset propaganda”. Small changes built up over time can improve your life, but these billionaires were born wealthy and made money off the backs of others, you won't become one by making your bed and drinking smoothies. I'm not a billionaire, I guess being disabled I'm kind of the opposite of one?? But because of this I've had the time and the need to try a lot of the stuff on this list. Here are my thoughts.  -Make bed...I'm in my mid 30s and I only make my bed if company is coming. No one cares, do it if you want but it's not that important. Especially if you share a bed with someone who isn't awake yet. It's more important to do a few chores around the house, like starting some laundry or cleaning up in the kitchen. Your morning routine of taking the dog out is actually already a good habit.  -Drinking water is important, and especially if you take morning medications. Some meds don't work as well or can make you nauseous without a full glass of water. If you don't drink enough water it can be helpful to set aside time, but I found it more useful to replace other beverages with water. I almost never drink soda or coffee anymore. It's a bummer at first but it will feel better later. I noticed eating breakfast isn't on the list, I guess the smoothie is supposed to replace your morning meal, but the ingredients listed are...ugh. It's easier and tastes better to grab a bunch of frozen bags of mixed fruits and vegetables (you can find them specifically for smoothies), and blend it with ice. I like to add protein powder (I prefer vanilla), chia seeds, ginger and lecithin. Juice or water to help it blend. But if you're hungry you should eat. Find some healthy things that you like eating. You need energy for the rest of the day!   -Here's a tip: Breathing, meditating, and moving your body should be done at roughly the same time! Just pick a yoga video on youtube, there's tons of them. Yoga with Adrienne and Yoga with Kassandra are both great. Breathe while you move. Meditate in shavasana. Breathe while you meditate! Focusing on the breath is a tried and true meditation technique. And yes, boredom is normal. Strong feelings seemingly out of nowhere can be normal. It will pass, especially when you start learning more about how meditation works. I recommend the apps waking up and medito. And lumenate if you want to try something kind of weird. It helps me with migraines.  -I can't take cold showers because I get hives, but a quick shower can wake you up, and you can use hot and cold water to regulate emotions, cold for anxiety, warm for depression. But honestly, if you don't like cold showers you can just splash cold water on your face and get the same effect faster and more comfortably. The key with a lot of this stuff is to create long term habits, so you should start small and not burden yourself with lots of things you aren't enjoying.  -Tea has been one of the most helpful things I've found personally. Mint helps with digestion, ginger with pain, chamomile and valerian for relaxation and sleep, green (I use jasmine) for energy. There's no reason you have to do this in the morning. Just do it as needed. You're already chugging water and smoothies, I would say tea might be better later in the day, or even before bed, or of course as needed to help with pain, anxiety, etc. I got a nice Uncle Iroh tea pot and a warmer with a tea light candle in it and I just keep it in my office and drink it while I work.  -Journaling, reading, dream recall, brain training AND list making??? That's so much! I don't exactly journal because I already do a lot of writing. I do log my meals, take down my blood pressure, and make to-do and grocery lists. I would say it's good to have a journal if you feel like there's something you want to write down, for example if you have a dream you think is significant. Dream recall is mostly just useful if you have a lot of nightmares you want to work through, or if you want to learn lucid dreaming. But if your dreams don't concern you, there's no need to re-visit them. I would say focus on sleep hygiene instead. My entire life (including my dreams) improved when I started CPAP for sleep apnea, and sleep medications to help me fall asleep and stay asleep (but I haven't needed them since starting CPAP). Focus on trying to go to sleep and wake up at roughly the same time each day. Reading is great, but there's no need to do it in the morning unless that's the best time you have to set aside. The “to-feel and “to-be” lists are a strange thing to do every day, in my opinion. I make these kinds of lists every few months, or when I'm feeling stuck, stagnant or displeased with my life. Usually the lists I make are more like “who am I” and “what do I want/need”. In my experience, seeing a therapist regularly is better than all this. A good therapist can help you organize your thoughts and help you figure out how to achieve your goals, and if you have a more significant problem in life, having a therapist who already knows you can really help. I've been seeing my current therapist bi-weekly for six years and she's amazing. She got me through some really dark times, and is helping me become the person I want to be in spite of my limitations.
after becoming a country boy and poisoning himself with colorful ramen, kurtis truly needed this for a change
Ya ya ya! more vids like this
Can you get Jenna to do a decor tour
kurtis is based
If a cold shower doesn’t immediately ruin your mood/day- you’re just plain evil. Much like billionaires! 😌
You can body shame a billionaire.
Extra based Kurtis today
The only way cold showers are good is when it's super hot (hot and humid is the worst) outside and the power or ac is out and it's like you're in a hot box. So going outside is a bad idea. So a cold shower will cool you off. I've done that during a few hurricanes when I lived in Florida. Take a cold shower or get in a tub full of cold water. I feel like that video was using a cold shower as a quick muscle relaxer. That's why people with muscle problems get ice baths.
What I did I say about losing the stache...     IS that a mullet...?
I love Kurtis's hair grown out like this it looks so good, and he's mustache is looking really cool too! Also the intro to the video was so sick.
kurtis is genuinely testing my , probably all of ours , self control with the real billionaire morning routine
This video was especially hilarious, I was cryin by the end
Today you feel nothing   Yeah you're right
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I literally had a dream about naruto running across some rooftops. Don't really see what problem I was trying to fix there either tbh.
I like the "To Be" list. Many people push their goals aside because of minor distractions
you’re so cool Kurtis!
With ALL respect to Jenna. Kurtis, you look beautiful.
great video kurtis :D
i had a dream one time that i was being chased by a dinosaur and there was a hamster ball
They are telling you how to be a billionaire and your not listening... Bro you could be rich
i love your mug
I love based Kurtis 😎
Very good content
the batshit crazy morning routine kurtis came up with actually seems more enjoyable than the other one
So research shows you need to do approx 21 days of mindfulness to feel the effects, so 20 mins straight off is very difficult, and at first it will seem boring and your head is full of thoughts but over time, it’s great :)
9:14 you NAILED IT yup yup :"8:30+ then he zooms in on certain types of people & it is like cringe"
Unrelated but I really like how many plants Kurtis has around
Warren Buffet’s teeth make sense since nowhere in that routine was brushing your teeth
My dad literally takes a strainer filled with ice into the shower with him because he doesn't think our shower is cold enough
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"he's got overcast in his mouth"  sheeeeesh
the alpha breathing wrecked me 😂
the rugrats transitions!!!!
Should have mimicked Rogan. Would have made it further
hey kurtis idk if you knew this or not but i did the math and jeff bezos could give every single human on earth 1,000,000 dollars nearly 24 times. eat the rich.
11:53 you wrong for this😭
the fact that kurtis gets up in the morning to take care of their dog while jenna sleeps >>>>>>>>>
the breathing tutorial guy reminds me of the billionaire in Don’t Look Up lmfao
Drop the house tour
The sad thing is, I was waiting for that guy to pitch a product and or course for people to buy. People do all of that odd stuff and it's gonna work without that person's product(s) and or course. I'm feeling like that's gonna lead to more buying as usual. Get someone hooked onto the product or course, then get upsold one or more times. It's probably on a subscription base as usual.
Are you a macnab alum!?
LOL!!! 6:30
i love the part where he says "that's my boy" and puts the clip of Amos Diggory in Harry Potter lmaoooo
Kurtis mentioned playing bingo with old people so I must confess my sins and admit I went to a nursing home with my class one day and beat a bunch of old people at bingo and the guilt still haunts me to this day
I start with warm water then progress to cold so my body gets used to it, although shock is pretty okay
16:05 I can’t stop laughing
A quick Google search shows that Jim Kwik (the guy who made the morning routine video) only has an estimated net worth of $53 million. Not even close to the billionaire status he's claiming smh.
Kurtis.. most of ur dreams just sound like u have anxiety
Sounds like you opened a can of worms in that dream...
Add some juice or some yogurt to that smoothie for the ~taste and texture~
Why don’t you look at videos like zebra corner videos, those are skits. They involve not just him but other people in the skits. Or why don’t you look at Scott cramers videos. It’s similar to yours, but he makes a point as to why the videos he critiques are ridiculous. All you do is video, joke, skit, but a skit which only involves you. And this whole self awareness of your jokes being bland is wayyyyyy overplayed. We get it, you’re self aware buddy, but can you now make some real jokes? I don’t get it either you literally were doing great from the beginning to 11:30 mark. Jokes were fast, on point, you reverted to the video you were critiquing. But then you just went on a tangent with the longest skit involving one person, playing different characters, ever. Like you wouldn’t be doing that at stand up. Stand up is topic, joke, punchline. Why don’t you do the same for your videos. They’d be way more entertaining. I wish you the best
genuinely appreciate your videos so much. Always remind me how much i love to laugh, appreciate you kurtboy
Finally my Mayor is back in the office.
not sure what this says about billionaires but i feel like maybe the "to feel" and "to be" list might be more beneficial to mentally ill people lol
kurtis kurtis he's our man if he can't do it no one can
Nice CKY usage Kurtis
I guess if this doesn't work for people to make them rich or successful, then they made the drink wrong. He didn't tell people what the other gems are for the drink. Basically this guy is indirectly saying that people should have a great mind set everyday to be successful. He's just explaining what he does to get that mind set. If it's weird or odd, then it must work. Maybe not. Yes, most or all highly successful people are odd people. That doesn't mean that a person saying how to be successful by doing odd stuff is actually a successful/rich person.
I fucking loved this
The alpha breathing footage is so cursed
omg todays my birthday and Kurtis posting is the best gift ever
This is the type of shit I get told to do (I have ADHD) and I’m here like bitch I don’t remember to go to the toilet sometimes how am I gonna remember all of this bullshit 😭
Oh no! You had a dream about peeing on a hotel bed? I’m not gonna tell you what it means but just be careful around meerkats.
So you’re telling me my counselor was teaching me alpha breathing this week?
good video
this is custom made for Hasan to react on stream
6:46 he looks so happy and relaxed🥰
comrade kurtis ☭
hell yea home slice bring it you got the goods for us all damn "I lived like a billionaire for a week" BOOM
I laughed so much
this made me laugh so hard pls make more vids like this
i want a video of kurtis roasting billionaires pls
I had a dream where I was adopted by a random family on a farm, whose friends were Dina from the last of us 2 and Ellie, and we played league of legends I think I dont play that game but i think that's what it was. and we were going to play red dead redemption 2 after, but I woke up.
ok but now you gotta make a 30 minute long video thats just you roasting billionaires in the style of that intro 😍
"You're allowed to body shame a billionaire." Words to live by
Enjoyed the vid as always brofrere. But I can’t stop myself from pointing out that to be a billionaire you have to write TWO to-do lists. One with 3 work goals and one with 3 personal goals for the day. Sucks being a good listener wasn’t on the day you watched the video…
this is literally the most we’ve ever seen of his place
Your humor is so creative I absolutely love watching your videos just to see your creativity
thank you for the fart joke, but personally I would've taken the route of farting the whole time during the meditation for more farts! great video man keep it up
I like tea :(
19:40 kurtis trying to put a end piece in the middle of a puzzle, peak comedy
why did he squeeze the avocado im crying
What worries me about these routines is not that I think they don’t work. I worry the level of obsession and dedication they have to it. If it doesn’t go exactly right, what would happen then?
OH MY GOD I THINK THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO YOU HAVE EVER MADE. 7 minutes in and I’m WHEEZING
Whats the song at the 6 MINUTE??
27:14 not the dad from Stay Out Of The Basement lakshdjdjdhd 😭😭
ur mustache in this video pisses me off
Damn that shower is a billionaire’s shower. Kurtis what aren’t you telling us??
why does kurtis' handwriting look like a little kid's handwriting
i love your home decor! the plants all look great.
17:12 - 18:59 POV: you go to a Canadian Jamba Juice
Dang ur alpha breath stinks...  I literally saw the life leave your eyes when you drank that smoothie. You good, bro?
"Instead of meditating, you're gonna play the Thomas the Tank Engine theme at full blast and you're gonna sit there and think about every single mistake you've ever made in your life." Wow, I'm already well on my way to being a billionare!
You're old
Fact: Anyone who believes their personal interests and habits are universal lacks empathy and shouldn’t tell anyone else how to live.   And of course, if everyone was a billionaire, then nobody would be a billionaire because money would be worthless and nobody would do any work.
the first three seconds of the song he overlaid with tony hawk footage is making me time travel but i cannot remember the name of the song for the life of me someone pls help i need to travel back to 2004 immediately
Megamind’s morning routine 🧠
Tried to alpha breath abs I drooled 😞
DID KURTIS JUST SAY "later in the morning type beat" cuz I'm floored lol
Idk why but “I almost forgot my probiotic” sent me 😂
This video made me shit and piss, it so was so funny
I think my most favorite part was Smoothie Time… Lmao @ his excitement! 😉😂
comment if u want more videos like this? show us the worms internet boy
I love how your mustache looks like tarantula fangs
11:53 is reenacting the cedric diggory scene with ur dog a universal experience bc if so, same
I'm in the beginning of this video, and I could watch an hour of you shaming billionaires. I'm loving class conscious Kurtis!
This video was awesome
It's too early in the morning for this. (11:20PM)
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Kurtis is starting to look like my dad's high school pictures
I've been watching this channel for a while now and this is genuinely one of the funniest videos he's made. I cannot stop laughing.........haha.  I wasn't being sarcastic, but it looked like I was, so I figured I'd just lay into it.
maybe the new year just hit me but i feel like kurtis had an subtle extra glow up the second he posted that favorite tik tok video last month. i think the colors blue and green were made for him lol.
Curtis looks like a new yorker after doing a, “one month in the south” tictok.
According to my psych professor dreaming about wetting your bed means theres a problem in your life you’re avoiding so do with that that what you will
Wtf? I wasn't subscribed? Seriously, wtf?
your guys’ house is literally so gorgeous 😭 props to bestie jenna!!! <3
for a multi-billionaire, i was expecting better handwriting.
comrade kurtis
The morning routine is very healthy but a majority of people dont have that luxury to wake up simply and calmly. The people billionaires exploit have to head to work the moment they awake in the morning. This morning routine is for already wealthy people. \
ayy Ontario lockdown squadddd
One if my favorite  videos 10/10
Dam kurtis looks so fine right after he wakes up
the sudden amos diggory clip brought back traumatic memories
Had a dream last night you were my older brother and bought me socks. it was pretty cool. I think this dream means that you're my older brother and clearly owe me some GD socks.
Why does this guy sound like cody ko
I think cold showers are actually really helpful for depression. It sounds weird I know but once I was so depressed I didn't want to get out of bed so for several days I barely did and then my mom suggested a cold shower. I did it and I felt so revitalized and motivated to clean and stuff.
kurttis I have deceased
You say billionaire because your a millionaire already huh
5 minutes in and I’ve already laughed more than I have all day. A+
HAHA not money book and alpha breathing
I'd say for the cold shower, start with your standard temperature and then during the shower turn it down for a bit.
I get so disgusted when I hear about billionaire tech bro types who are super into meditation and new age crap. As a person who kind of takes magickal stuff somewhat seriously it’s so especially gross to see people take ancient spiritual practices  for getting to know and better one’s self, and using that to make them better capitalists, an economic engine that’s central powerhouse is greed seems directly counterproductive and dare I say blasphemous
Dang ur Alpha breath  stinks
more blueberries, more water. frozen avo.
Lyrics: "I drink too much coffee and wine My body hurts like all the time" Bars
Hello fresh spends thousands of dollars a day on union busting.
Anyone else read the "money book" as "monkey book"?
okay but........ *can* we have a video thats just you making fun of billionaires /hj
Cool math game has math in the title so it must be brain helping
Emotional how billionaires have so much time to waste doing nonsense,, babe everyone else has places to be like making ur money for u because u work so hard 💕
I wish you played Brain Age for your brain training! A missed opportunity
Billionaires do not need to be a thing, you can get to 9,999,999 then every dollar above is good for you points
kurtis i'm fucking passing away you rly just came for billionaires for 30 full minutes and i LOVE that for you
seeing the rest of Kurtis’s house was exciting
OR hear me out I may sound crazy, maybe just maybe there are less black billionaires in America because there are less black people in America than white people. In know, I know, but just give it a thought
“you can body shame a billionaire, as a treat” i missed you kurtis
when he said ontario the first time he meant another ontario, one where he doesn’t live.
Your moustache was distracting me so much this entire video
Can you please make a video that's just 30 minutes of roasting old rich white dudes?
"But don't worry; I found a way to make it *hilarious*." The second he said that. The _second_ he said that. I damn well knew a fart joke was coming up. "Okay, hot take on cold showers--" Don't you mean cold take
dang ur alpha breath stinks
kurtis: drinks chamomile and is confused on why he got tired
Oh boy here we go, the lamest comedian on YouTube. You just do the same ol jokes. Bland boring jokes followed by a terrible skit. No variety, no cleverness, just lazy jokes
kurtis... the daily affirmations instagram account shirt... i love
this is completely unrelated but i’m a massive fan of ur home decor lmao
"yeah human brains in a little tea bag" ... "I'm a murderer :) ❤️✨"
dang ur alpha breath stinks
This is the kind of stuff I want to watch while cleaning my room or dyeing my hair I love it
kurtis’ dreams. that’s it.
They be acting like their dreams make sense- like dreams consist of things you've thought of before. Say I was thinking about cookies. My dream could be about cookies, killing the whole planet..
dude ur mullet is looking fkn beautiful
fun fact for kurtis: a dream about eating worms is actually interpreted to mean u are feeling fatigued with work or burnt out
dang ur alpha breath stinks tho
Damn Kurt’s house is so nice
its my birthday and im was so excited when i saw you posted today
jeffs left eyeball gets nowhere near the level of public attention it deserves. thank u for speaking out
i want someone to actually do the morning routine that kurtis suggested and see how it goes
I like how kurtis, Danny, “drew”, jarvis, and Cody all talk exactly the same and have the same humor.
I just laughed for 30 minutes straight man
no shit, my uncle does this every morning. He is the CEO of a massive company and lives by rituals, i thought this video was so creepy casuse everytime something would happen id be reminded of him
I had a nightmare that kurtis had straightened his hair and had really short bangs
ok this cold shower hate is just to much, as a person that lives in Australia aka satans bootyhole cold showers are ligit the life blood of our nation.
I choose to be a bad person everyday. So far has been working out got many billions.
the funny thing is; is that capital-economists actually encourage inflation at a rate if about 2-3% a year to prevent deflation. what they're actually worried about is hyperinflation, which i still don't know what mean but yeah,   🌟the more you know🌟  (edit: i meant capitalist-economists in the first sentence)
Kurt, you had chamomile tea which works to make you relaxed and tired – best to take before bed. This probably added on to feeling sleepy in the morning. Black tea, oolong, or even green are a better base, with herbs such as ginger, clove, or rosemary.
material gworl!
it must a "haha im just a quirky influencer with all the time in the world that i dont utilize properly" thing to leave your christmas tree up through january and february. jenna marbles used to do the same thing
this sounds like neurosis lol having this elaborate of a routine with this many steps that you Have to do in that order feels exactly like my anxiety
never. ever. do alpha breathing again.
Kurtis Marx dropping the Kurtistown Manifesto
I think I can positively say I am not billionaire material after the guy said brain training and my mind went immediately to the DS game.
I wonder what Kurtis had to look through to get to that business lion picture...
*COMRADE CONNER!!*
the list was lowkey good
Am I watching the Hasanabi broadcast rn?
I laughed more with this video than i have all year
You sleep next to a woman? OMG, COOTIES, AMIRITE!? GUISE!? HAHAAAAAAAAA! I'm a silly boy!
Kurtis you have such a pretty house
honestly some of these things are good for you and I feel like the breathing thing, instead of watever th "alpha breathing" just focusing on something other than thoughts like intentional breathing could be good too. also it def doesnt have to be a certain time i think it differs with each person like rn im just taking 2 min out of my day and its kinda nice :D
"It was like listening to a podcast but not funny" is the way I assume a middle school boy would describe guided meditation.
DANG YOUR ALPHA BREATH STINKS
dang ur alpha breath stinks
m o r n i n g r o u t i n e
GOOD MORNING   o-o
your handwriting looks exactly how i expected it to look
Kurtis is that a Rick Steves calendar? This is the exact intersection of my interests
Kurtis, honey, put a banana in there, some fruit juice, something sweet 😰
Oh god, the dream part just reminded me that I had a dream that I went on a trip with Kurtis for his birthday and then I ditched him to hang out with some skaters I just met, and he was super disappointed and upset that I was a bad friend.  So, uh, sorry Kurtis. 😅
honestly shout out to kurtis for taking a cold shower every day for a week in winter. i live in new england and winter's here already suck, i can barely imagine how much colder it must be where he lives and how much worse that would be with a cold shower every day
Kurtis is looking like the cool 80s dad who played DnD and neglected his kids.
kurtis give us a house tour please i want my house to look like yours
kinda unrelated but Kurtis' bedroom decor kinda goes hard... I wonder where he got those cool trees hanging on the wall?
Ayo thanks for this vid kurtis, it inspired me to do some kinky fanart, thx
Is Kurtis trying to be a billionaire because he's already a millionaire?   Also Fun Fact: That CKY song is in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and not 2. Lol
are you oates from hall & oates, be honest
Some of these things might be nice to add in, but who really has the time for all of it?!
Spinidge
Making your bed After waking up is actually bad for your matress. Just sayin.
I am in a complicated, special relationship with the mullet ❤️
I don’t know why, but for some reason Kurtis is reminding more and more of that guy on Tik Tok that talks about Canadian stuff. 🤔
kurtis, you and danny and drew make me feel so much better. sometimes when i’m rlly sad i’ll just rewatch a couple of yalls videos and feel better
“Bingo Hall of Fame” is the most accurate description of these billionaires EVER
Kurtis PLEASE watch the movie cats for a video
home alone and that breathing bit had me paranoid as fuck for no reason
Dreaming of peeing in bed – If you dreamed about peeing in your bed, that dream is not a good sign, and usually indicates that you have some unresolved painful issues and traumas from the past which are still haunting you and blocking your movement forward.  Dreaming of peeing in unusual places – If you dreamed of peeing someplace unusual, that dream usually indicates some problem or issue you will be forced to deal with on your own, relying on your abilities.
as someone with one eye that is much smaller than the other, please continue to body shame the FUCK out of jeff bezos
None of these billionaires have to be at work at 7:00 AM and it shows.
The intro had me smiling from ear to ear, and the rest of the video did not disappoint. Thank you!
the uh. sarcastic billion dollar routine is literally just Depression 😭😭
I want more videos like this!!!
the entire smoothie scene had me wheezing
If you hate billionaires you should look to join your local Communist Club
Kurtis you video keeps deleting my great suggestions when it comes to books
The cold showers thing isn't supposed to be like that, the guy should've said so.  The method is having a normal shower and then gradually turn the water cold. And you start with whatever time you want,.maybe the first time its 10 seconds   and everyday you increase it. Its the wim hof method.  Its supposed to have a lot of benefits for your health.   I liked the video! I really like when you speak about important things, like you did in the start of the video.  Fuck capitalism.
This morning routine is so fucking long that there's no way this is true. Tea AND a smoothie. But no, he doesn't drink them back to back, he drinks the tea first, then like an hour later makes the smoothie. Also how do you come up with a unique to-do list every day?
hopefully if i keep working a 9-6 on minimum wage for the next 70 years ill become a billionaire too🙏🙏💯
dont u do this every week though
“I have to make a list for work 😎” -youtuber
the original video sounds like a chris fleming bit
really good video Kurtis! Lots of good jokes that make me chuckle.
that guy reminds me of how when i was 6 before i went to school i would plan emotions, so i'd plan to act sad and lonely at recess and then angry and upset at lunch lmao
“he’s got overcast on his teeth”💀💀💀
are brain smoothies better or worse than cotton candy ramen
Kurtis ur mullet looks fckn epic
would love to see more of this kind of content!
Bruh that's such a nice shower you sure you aren't a billionaire already?
dang ur alpha breath stinks
This was hilarious, I really laugh a lot  omg  Anyone else was laughing but a little bothered by the little details that kurtis forgot to do? I'm probably just this kind of person that has to do things exactly.... to be a billionaire
This guy is a psychopath having to write out his entire personality. Dang.
Cold shower has always been accosiated with bodybuilding. The claim goes that somehow, cold water helps promote muscle growth after a workout. There is no proof of this claim, but people still do this for some reason. From what i gather, some bullshit about "self controll" Because nothing says self controll like masochism
The fact that the edit in 1:57 looks more normal than the actual pic💀💀
I'm sure a 2 hour routine is great for people who haven't hard to put actual work into doing anything in decades, and needs something mindbogglingly tedious to help stave off the lethargy.
Wait. There's a such thing as too much coffee and wine??
KURTis your alpha breathing was too much i had to skip
Eat your worms Kurtis
I would watch a 30 minute video of just Kurtis recounting his dreams
the breathing guy really reminds me of peter isherwell from Don't Look Up
That alpha breathing video is truly haunting
The alpha male narrating the Billionaire Morning Routine sounds like Cody Ko.
ok but like can we have an hour long video of kurtis just roasting billionaires please????????
sick Majora's Mask reference
I 👏 need 👏 more 👏 kiwi 👏 content 👏 look at him go! 🥺
this video legitimately feels like something that my school would show us during an assembly to try to inspire us
Headspace actually made me very anxious when I tried it
the asher roth dream omg
bro last night i had a dream that my parents died and my brother went "lmao that sucks for you/" I have no idea what problem Im having irl that would require my entire family abandoning me to solve
for some reason, you remind me of ricky bowen
ima try this for a day  *files for bankruptcy 1 hour in*
I like how you pronounce “spinach”, it sounds like “spinadge”!
God Damn It! The breathing killed me😂😂😂
I work at 11:30am monday-thursday. I (theoretically) have enough time in the morning to do this. But the thing is i wake up and i have dishes to wash. I have trash to take out. I have to call my doctor and figure out insurance information. I have to write out my rent check. I cant spend two-four hours doing all this stuff because i have to do things that someone who is a billionare literally will never have to do if they dont want to. It boggles my mind at the privilege.
I never noticed Jeff bezos different sized eye balls until now and I will never get over this news.
lol says spinach like cabbage.. spinage
I actually wanted to know what he thought of the book 😫
Y'all be having dreams to recall? I remember like 20 total in my entire life and most of them are about stress/fears I have :/
kurtis should do more vlog-like videos. i really liked this.
It cost this man's integrity plus 1.2M to live like a billionaire
anyone else think the guy narrating the vid sounds like ryan reynolds
Fun fact: I used to know someone named Christian Grey who actually met Warren Buffett
Kurtis is starting to look like young Weird Al.
I dunno, a lot of this dude's morning advice isn't that bad. It does seem to come from a place of entitlement, which sucks, but mindfulness, movement, setting goals...all highly recommended for better mental and physical health.  But still very entertaining video, and dang, your alpha breath stinks
I drink too much coffee and whine too, Kurtis... I do too...
The “to feel list” 😂
I do reccomend meditation, I meditate on the impermanence of life and that really gives me the motivation to eat the rich while I can.
Kurtis making this fuckey video in the sick ass house that Jenna decorated is so funny
reading is good :D
You forgot the probiotics on your list when you first wrote it out 😂
He looks so uncomfortable doing the alpha breathing. He looks like me when I met a relative and I don't know who the fuck they are.
i absolutely lost it when he cut himself off for the conclusion part
curtis the reason this routine didnt work is because youre immune to becoming a billionaire. you had the special vaccination called having empathy and being human.
People who post themselves doing these “routines” on things like TikTok are really harming peoples’ mental health. I read some really interesting articles about how it just perpetuates the idea that your life isn’t as perfect as those people on social media who wake up at 7am and have done so much in their day before you’ve even woken up. But realistically, this sort of thing isn’t the norm and it’s more than ok to not live up to these standards. No one can uphold this sort of thing without eventually burning out (probably pretty quickly too)
When I wake up in the morning I take a nap. It really helps charge my batteries to get me ready for what I always assume is going to be a shitty day that day. Also that morning routine at the end was hilarious.
I loved this video Kurtboi!
He sounds very sick after LMAO. I mean he always does, but y'know what i mean
most of the time dreams are total nonsense, but they genuinely can reveal some insights about your current mental state or issues you’re dealing with in real life. I think recognizing common themes in your dreams and trying to understand why they’re happening can be really beneficial and emotionally intelligent
RESTOCK!!!!!! YOUR!!!!!!! SWEATSHIRTS!!!!!!! ITS!!!!!! NOT!!!!!!!! NICE!!!!!!! THAT!!!!! THEYRE!!!!! SOLD!!!!! OUT!!!!!
Here's a pro tip for the smoothies.   Don't drink them unless you use ice cubes instead of water,  add one full size Snickers, 3 double A batteries, a 1/4oz of catnip, a copy of the E1999 Eternal CD, and 17 raw bacon slices.
that breathing bit was scary as shit D:  very well done it was so unsettling!
When Kurtis opens his mouth, you just know that he's gonna say something in his video !
Dang your alpha breath stinks..
nice afffirmations shirt, kurtis
as soon as you farted, i liked the video
i swear kurtis named kiwi after the HS song lol
So the guy that made the video is implying that HE is a billionare?? lol I couldve made that video.
This video actually made me feel a lot better about myself because I struggle to have a consistent routine because of my mental health and a lot of the shit I see on social media makes me feel bad about the routines I have developed. Reminder that social media really is just social media
New kurtis video, IM GONNA SQUEET
11:38 Survive Natural Disaster Volcano core
interpretation of kurtis connor's dream of eating above the medically recommended dose of worms.  worms = bad media/messages you consume, which can be okay in small amounts as like junk food, but you dont want to get brain worms. maybe your unconscious doctor self wants some documentaries or something 😂
I am crying laughing throughout this entire video
Love the breath like a velociraptor tutorial!!🤣
DO MORE LIKE THIIIIIS 👍
I will say that when you came back a week later, you looked really fresh like you had just had a shower and had been eating well! Your skin looks great and your eyes are bright.
Love the afffirmations shirt
If you piss in your dreams it just means you gotta piss. I have recurring dreams where I pass in trash cans and then wake up with a way too full bladder. First task of the morning is to piss... ...on the bed
one of my last dreams was my brother coming into my room to tell me my computer was sick so I could not get on it today I remember crying a lot in the dream after that and remembered dream me saying in a winy voice "why" then i started bursting into tears
9:11 I cried actual tears oh my god
where are my girls who choose the apple at panera? i can’t believe kurtis just insulted us 😔
I laughed throughout this entire video and the last section killed me! Your deliveries are so good! I love when you make these kinds of videos. You're great, man!
ily
9:10 I AM SCREAMING HOLY SHIT LMAO SOMEBODY PLEASE CLIP THAT OUT OF CONTEXT
When you learned he had to take showers I lost it
Lol body shaming Jeff bezos made my entire week
I never take cold showers, I take hot showers, but I have the cold water when I’m washing my face and for like 20 seconds before I turn off the water.
I think if you're really into being an elon musk bootlicker, or truly believe in alpha/beta crap, then doing this is probably good for you. (Also wow, just realised the word, alphabet ical is because its literally the first two Greek letters!)
This video was an excuse Kurtis used to make us think he actually showers
Your journaling corner has the cutest damn chair and plant combo I’ve ever seen.
Kurtis, you said the same thing last year hahhahahahahha
Kurtis I am desperate to read the rest of your shirt. Your art does what???
My 3 things to accomplish list: Get the money, take the money, spend the money.
22:38 a s c e n s i o n
I keep dreaming that zombies are trying to eat me
I showed my 5 year old sister your face and she said” EW he has a nose ring”😭😭😭
holy shit this is one of ur funniest videos in a while
Me dreaming about having double my cats and trying to figure out which ones are my real cats
“Alpha breathing” yeah sure bud, we all know you’re just a Hamon master
I knew the fart was coming, and I laughed anyway
gotta love Kurtis for trying so hard! i laughed out loud during the whole video. thank you for this, my guy <3 :')
Yooo Kurtis mentioning and acknowledging Thomas and Friends. Hell yeah that's dope. Love it.
damn kurtis has a really nice house i wanna tour now
Laughed so hard at this!
0:46  *building a better boy*
As a professional dream interpreter, I can say that your second dream means that you will sell images of your urine as NFTs in the coming month.
Bro Kurtis youre lookin absolutely gorgeous my dude. Holy fuck. Thanks for leaving my idea of my sexual orientation in absolute shambles
Does it look like to anyone else that Kurtis has a tiny slightly darker moustache on top of his big main moustache?
my dad takes cold showers cause of eczema but like it’s not a choice so he’s not that weird yet
Beautiful hair kurtboy! Also. Great video 😄
I feel like Kurtis, Drew and Danny have the same energy. They come as a package
Kurtis dreams are soo on  point bro this is a sign to make skits out of your dreams i would soo watch that haha
that alpha breathing segment...when I tell you I DIED and I couldn't stop laughing oh my god
My house for a very long time have only cold water and I have to admit I am getting used to that and my skin and hair definitely is better with it... but I am from a tropical country not canada so... ://
only a few minutes in this video but god kurtis you are so unbelievably based
Lol I already get up at 7 to get to work at 930 and all I have to do is wash, dress, eat, and make lunch. I guess that's why I'm just a poor and not a billionaire.   Also 100 percent this guy lives in a warm climate because it's way too fucking cold in Canada to do cold showers
The Mountain Dew and Cosmic brownies are the average breakfast of young college students is what I've learned from working at a retail cafe at a college. I have a student who eats 4 chocolate bars, two small bags of Lay's & a Mountain Dew every morning. I had another student who would drink 4 Mountain Dews in the morning just to wake up. I'm sure some of them when they don't have class or other things to do play Tony Hawk til they pass out as well.
kurtis, you look like an 80's dad
The way this guy describes "breathing like an alpha" sounds almost exactly like how my speech therapist taught me how to pronounce my R's.
Hey that "Alpha Breathing" is a technique my therapist taught me to come down from panic and anxiety attacks! it actually works wonders for me. had no clue it was called alpha breathing
I want a video of Kurt's making fun of the 1 percent I tell you what
I need this sweater where do I get it
more like this.
ontario solidarity 😭😩 Hamilton is doing rough too
omgggg the body shaming billionaires bit was so good lolol
hey man where'd you get that throw blanket on the end of your bed im obsessed with it
Living like a billionaire for a week… more like **living WITH a billionaire for a week AND A HALF!!**  Right?
Kurt: God it’s so thick That’s what she sa-    This user was terminated.
great video curtis, you really followed through. love to see it. edit: you might wanna be careful bud - thats a LOT of worms i dont think that is healthy
But mainly: do an 🎱 first so you have the energy to do all this stupid crap. At least you’ll get through it at record pace and have a blast doing it. Pro tip. You’re welcome. Happy 2022.    (2023s goals: go to rehab, probably)
I forgot Canada uses Celsius for a second, so when he said -20° I was like BRO?? YOU GOOD⁉️
The only good blanket advice in this is drink water (lots of people tend to wake up a bit dehydrated) and meditation (generally good but there's a hundred thousand ways of doing it). The journalling was... sociopathic at best. Cool thing is, the REAL routine proposed by Kurtis is essentially the way Warren Buffett has been living for the last 100 years so it must work, and give you a side of colourful teeth yay
Sorta early love your videos recently I’ve been re-binge watching your videos
My guts hurt from watching Kurtis write "horny" three times 😂
omg! Kurtis Corner?!
that morning routine is literally every inpatient psych hospital routine for the day
I only every have cold showers on 39/40 degree days. Our air conditioning is broken and it's hot in Australia.
Did anyone else breath along with the alpha breathing? Lol
cold showers are healthy. helps healthy blood flow
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Billionares: the key to money is work hard every second, 3 hours sleep and get on that billionaire grind.  Also Billionares: the key to money is 20 minute meditation.
now i want the billionare to do connors routine
They all value minimalism and simple living, but they are literally overthinking and nitpicking about the most normal routines.
you didnt become a billionaire bc you forgot the probiotics and vitamins  edit: oh you took it but not with water...
kuts conr
you didnt become a billionaire bc you forgot the probiotics
this guy doesn't have brush teeth or moisturize in his morning at all? Or what about go to the bathroom?
Fantastic video 🫐
4 easy payments of 30 seconds KILLED me. And legit when you lifted the hot tea and said "I should have, you know?" I did know! Lol I was right there with you
Not the Goosebumps clip of the dad eating plant food😭
Does Jeff bayzes have bell's palsy?
Although I really enjoyed this video I can't bring myself to ask for more videos of you torturing yourself.
I cannot believe you made that smoothie with so little water why did you do that to yourself man
As someone that has had to take a lot of cold showers because of severe skin issues I can confirm that it, indeed, fucking sucks
kurtis conner… i hardly know her
Kurtis was already a billionaire with a shower like that.
1:16 there’s just no explanation for this picture
can one of the citizens of kurtistown help me find the sound effect he used at 9:12? it's hilarious but I have no idea where it's from
I was trying to do the alpha breathing but, kurtis's manic smile made me lose my shit (almost literally 😳)
“You’re allowed to body shame a billionaire”  - Kurtis Connor 2022
Kurtis needs to become a country boy billionaire. That’s the only way
my morning routine is getting ready as quick as possible after realizing that I am about to be late to my classes
you can't have a morning routine if you don't have a morning. I like your content.
I can't wait to start the new Bata breathing and that cosmic smoothie and playing Tony hawk pro skater 2 to wake myself up
I’m probably just drunk rn but why tf was the intro 11 minutes long kurtis 😩 WHYY
Can we just take a second to admire kurtis’s shower
this was good, i have a moustache
Am I the only one that made a 2022 kurtis quote book?
kurt has the shower of a billionaire
Jeff Bezos, Loser? I hardly know her
Cold showers are more ... shocking, for lack of a better word, at waking you up fast I think. Also, if it's hot/warm outside, they can be refreshing.   But obviously not in Canada, or if you're already awake at that point lol.
The shot with Cedric's father hit hard because I was just watching that movie
In defense of cold showers: you shouldn't start out cold. You start out warm, and slowly make it cooler over a couple minutes. I do this because hot showers just make me sweat, and sweating in the shower is the grossest feeling ever. I don't know how people take scalding hot showers without stepping out a sweaty swampy disgusting mess. I have to have at least a little bit of cold at the end to feel clean. It's a sensory thing for some people.
Kinda gross billionaires eat human brains. They have such weird hobbies.  Edit: tried alpha breathing and started drooling. I'll never be a billionaire!!!!
i just realized we've never seen kurtis's house except for his kitchen and his office
6:50 fucking made me terrified I was wearing AirPods when the breathing part came up and I thought someone was next to me 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😩😂
I dont like the fact that your making fun of rich people on looks do more on stuff about stuff they did.
I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but people who are beginners at meditating usually start at one minute! It's actually impressive to even start at 10 mins. Nothing is wrong with your brain, you just build up stamina over time :) Meditation is usually about trying to focus on your body in space as well as your breathing. If your mind does wander, that's actually recognized as a moment of mindfulness. There may be a reason why you starting thinking about something specific.
the recalling your dreams thing is actually pretty good if you wanna have more chances of lucid dreaming!
sorry to change the subject, but your shower is hella nice 💯
I'm ready to try some of that morning routine
This morning routine is for people who don't work while their employees slave away
Kurt your eyes look especially beautiful today
Your hair looks so gender in this video??? Wtf
Interesting that this routine requires tons of free time. As if they don't work as hard as they claim? 🧐
Yo I knew he was Canadian I didn’t know he was also from Ontario thats kinda cool
I no longer connect with Kurtis now that he’s become a billionaire.
Ontario is -35 right now, no cold showers are happening!
Blending a can of mtn dew with cosmic brownies and playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is actually my evening routine
The alpha breathing is my new nightmare. So when I wake in the morning and recall my dream, it'll show me that I need alpha breathing in my life. Fucking thanks for that, kurtis
Ah yes the bed piss dream
We should eat them. 🤤
Dude, you are so hard to look at.
I remember being stuck with no AC one particularly brutal summer, and I would only take cold showers (and put my clothes in the freezer, lol) and my skin was glowing like I'd never seen before. I think it's good for blood flow or something, but I don't think I could do it 'just because' unless I was having a skincare day. I could settle for room temperature water though.
Weirdly enough today I decided to journal my dreams, meditate, pull out my books so I could start reading again, and I got a free box of Hello Fresh to try!  🤠👌🏽
You shoulda followed Jordan petersons advice where you pretend you family was straight up murdered
idk why but today you reminded me of paul wesley twice today
You dont get to feel today
Piss dream means you have two kinks. A piss kink and an exhibitionist kink. Thank me later bestie 🤗👍
dang ur alpha breath stinks
the 80s called, i don’t know how it’s a past year i’m honestly really confused
shirt cool
Warren buffets teeth 😂😭😭😭😭
I've never clicked faster
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Cool video.
"Which is weird cus she doesn't usually talk in her sleep" I'm dying 😅
I wanna drink some coffee now . ☕️
Kurtis can have a little body shaming… as a treat
excellent video Kurt!!
the problem with body shaming Bezos is that he will never see that but innocent people who resemble him will and feel bad about it. typed by a guy whos eyes do the same thing as Bezos's, RIP.
i seriously almost died at qigong breathing, dude u cant just take something and add 'alpha' to the front of it to make it ur own,
Meditation is always gonna be beneficial for anyone so it's always worth a try🙃
Ok but Kurtis your shower is so cool wtf
I both love and hate this video it’s hard to explain 😂👌And yea it sounds silly but I think deep breathing is essential for those with anxiety mainly, I just forget to strait up breath right 🤷 idk why it’s just how anxiety is for me. I like to get up and immediately follow a routine because getting things done makes me feel better and I’ll continue to get more done  (also that hair tho 😩💸
i don’t think kurtis has ever body shamed a woman it’s only men
The whole Alfa male thing literally seems like a mental illness now
i literally thought your name was kurtis corner
a food theory?
I often have dreams that I'm being murdered? And I had a realistic earthworm Jim dream... And one where my sister was kidnapped because of her mashed potato? Is any of this going to help me get rich?
pls do a video of you purely making fun of billionaires
can someone please make a compilation of mark zuk-my-balls trying to be relatable/funny/human because i see those clips everywhere and i actually can’t contain myself
this is a win for communism
Kurtis I see by the PC blueberries you shop at real canadian superstore. the best choice
I LOVE THIS
Kurtis, this introooo, omg iloveyou
That was a great fart.
My morning routine is sitting at my table for two hours and drinking an entire pot of coffee by myself.
Your bedroom is so cute I love it
The “grwm morning routine day in my life as a billionaire” video just sounds like the  American psycho morning routine monologue
1:42 So Kurtis Connor looks like Mr. Beast when you take away the long hair, that's.... that's odd to think about
Imma tell you right now... not a single solution is processed, intercreated or worked on during my dreams
I actually enjoy cool showers not nessisary cold but pretty cool
Bruh, when do you brush your teeth?!
makes sense theres no brushing teeth in the daily routine
I take cold showers in the summer when it's hot because I overheat easily. I cannot imagine doing this in the dead of winter.  Also, recording dreams is good if you're a writer or want to be a writer because I have some wildly detailed ones. I don't always remember to write them down though.
Tony, baby!
Looking✨ handsome✨
16:02 lmao
good content curtis ! thanks !
I think the dream about wetting the bed means you're a little piss baby. Source: I'm making shit up
Kurtis saying he wants to be "happy funny and strong" is very sweet
Kurtis, you peeing on the bed kinda reminds me of what you did in Jenna’s friend’s bedroom after you had 2 ciders and 1 weed…
Kutis looks like kiwi <3
As someone who has undergone a 28 day rehab program,  This was so much like the routine I had while over there. I mean I’m forever grateful for it but yeah
Healthy Smoothie option that actually tastes good (according to me) is half an avocado (or like a 1/2 cup of bits of frozen avocado) 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, a whole banana , a bit of maple syrup to sweeten it, and oat milk (as much as u want depending on the consistency you like) !
dang your alpha breath stinks
Hahahaha niiiiiice
Damn this vid’s been out for 5 hours and Kurtis already has to eat 37k worms
As my European co-worker tells me, I am the least Canadian she has ever met.  Right after grad I moved to  Europe.  Sirr, you are the one of very few Canadians that I proudly show as being from my birth country.
That Evangelion title card tho 👀
I like showers so cold that it makes breathing calmly difficult.  I also like showers so hot that I look like a lobster when I get out
Looking forward to discussing my weird nightmares of guys simultaneously smiling and heavy breathing with my therapist for the next few weeks. Thanks dude!
"today you feel nothing" i mean i've been numb for a week kurtis i wish that was news but i guess being a billionaire keeps you from learning anything😔
the shower flex kurtis! billionaire indeed
hey i like this video a lot
I SAY THAT "THAT'S MY SON. THAT'S MY BOOOY" LINE FROM GOBLET OF FIRE TO MY DOG CONSTANTLY. what does this mean
make more videos like these
Watching this at work was a mistake. I’m laughing out loud and crying.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
omg did you go to MacNab high school
dang ur alpha breath stinks
i fully support the leftism as well as the message of the video, but the marxist idea of "exploiting the working class" is a bit outdated and very oversimplfied
HELP RHIS VID IS SO FUCKING FUNNY
Honestly that list of shit seems more like a human doing then a human being haha.. how can you be when you've spent hours of your day just doing this pointless dumb shit lol..
hey kurtis
Imagine if this video was just kurtis putting a mid roll ad every minute💀
I think the purpose of cold shower is edging
Kurtis, you should take your dreams and turn them in to comedy sketches
Come out with new merch!!!! Love your vids kurtis!!!
Is Alpha breathing the new breath style in Demon Slayer?!
I just started watching the video and I have a serious question,,,,,, does elon musk classify as African???? He, technically speaking, is an African American
gentle  giant
the more I listen to that guy's morning routine the more I believe he's just an alien pretending to be as human as possible
dang your alpha breath stinks 😷
I love this format! I think you should do more of these
Actually, I’ve been interpreting dreams for a really long time now, and that dream of you peeing on the bed has a quite clear interpretation…  It’s that you’re a pissy piss boy who likes to piss on things, you piss boy. Ily 😘
Love this. So good. Thank you.
://///// that smoothie had nothing yum at all.
Reading IS fun, kurtis :)
The smoothie just needed some banana, avage, and strawberry greek yogurt + water
9:14 Isn't that kind of the canvas bags that people who pre-ordered Fallout '76 were supposed to get?
guys if you want success just do these three simple body functions, wake up, water, breath
ur shower looks weird
I bet somebody $20 that the cats thing was a foreshadow easteregg for the next video
You should make a video where you roast the fuck out of billionaires
why was i totally expecting kurtis's handwriting to look like that
KURTIS MY MAN THE FIRST THREE MINS OF THIS VIDEO HAS ABSOLUTELY ENDED ME I LOVE YOU LMAO thank u for making me smile and laugh like that I rlly needed that Ima watch the rest of the video now 💓
breathing segment got me quaking
Omg you got my haircut from 2013 😵🤣
After a quick Google search: To dream that you are urinating, is an omen of bad luck.
I have never felt a stronger need to do violence to my immediate surroundings in my life than I did upon hearing that man say we are human beings not human doings
13:25 why does it sound like the snake in Conan the barbarian ?💀
NEW KURT VIDEO YASSSSSSSSS
Dang your alpha breath stinks
i love every video you make where you experiment 😂 like the dedication always impresses me and your perspective of it is always so authentic and enlightening and funny.
Kurtboy these are my fav type of vids from u! Thoroughly enjoyed 😏
Kurtis, I just wanted to say that I was drinking at the same time as you and I burped at the same time as you.. that was the best moment of my day. so wholesome <3
hey we are wearing the same crewneck
One kid in meh class got vivid, half the class was snapped into quarantine
Kurtis gives me immense gender envy.
the aggressive breathing during the reading time lapse is mesmerising and kinda concerning not gonna lie
I see you're sticking with the John Oates look.
Kurtis saying "im a little cuck" will never leave my mind
Kurtis wearing a shirt that says be nice while body shaming billionaires Is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
First bro has like an 8 hour morning routine that some how ends with him taking one of their own courses 🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Dang your alpha breath STINKS
Kiwi is so cute!!
If you want to do meditation and ease into it, start with 5 minutes and move it up by 5 min intervals whenever youre comfortable. Before you know 20 goes by really fast
no intro ??😢
I am def not defending Jeff Bezos, he banned powe point presentations during meetings like why??? EVIL
I know I’m baked but this entire video sent me 😂💀
I’m here for outspoken socialism 😍
Do more videos like this
I tried following along with the alpha breathing technique in the video but th cuts to the good smile made me fuck up >:(
Kurtis doing the alfa breathing was horrifying.... gave you that happy serial killer look 👀
This is the hardest I've laughed at one of your videos in a HOT minute! Keep it up man
The conclusion had me D E A D
Not to be that person but  feel alpha breathing might r have ruined that man’s teeth, stay safe out there y’all
More Kiwi content, Kurtis please 🥺
i want more videos like this
Ngl the morning routine mentioned actually sounds really healthy. Not gonna be doing it anytime soon, but still, it’s a good idea
Okay but I would absolutely watch a video of Kurtis just making fun of old rich white people. It’s the content I want.
I’ve had a dream where my overalls didn’t fit. That was the whole dream
Why have you not been making smoothies?! How doyou get your nutrients?!
Cold showers always remind me of my childhood when my single mother couldn't afford to pay the gas bill sometimes cuz she was prioritizing in order to take care of 3 boys and we HAD to take a cold shower every morning before going to school.  That said, you would have to hold me at gunpoint to get me to take a cold shower. ☺️
You’re already half way to Rich! You’ve got a rich bratty girl type of dog
i thought you said "e-fish-ent" 😂 edit: i used to work on a boat and the showers rarely had warm water so i pretended to be in some tropical place with a cold waterfall whenever i took one lmao
"Billionaires work so much harder than us" Also Billionaires: have time every morning to do 6 hours of nonsense instead of working
The video I wanted: Kurtis making fun of rich old guys  The video I needed: ….actually I’m pretty sure I needed the video of Kurtis making fun of old guys too, but this one was pretty good.
I also walk my dog at the crack of dawn (2 hours south of Toronto) and I have been running my hands under hot water after a walk… so a cold shower would be an actual nightmare.
the idea of your dreams being a way to process the information you took in throughout the day and analyzing them is just a dream theory. it's not what happens fs. also it doesn't happen with every dream.
As someone with very uneven eyes; I allow this body shaming
You used the dad from my fave Goosebumps ep!!!
This is just an excuse for Curtis to show us his super fancy house!
Kurtis gradually losing his shit is the favorite part of my video 🥺.
In 2022 we’re bodyshaming billionaires
this has got to be the funniest guy LMAO
This ish was so dumb that I just laughed the whole video, omg it’s so dumb I am dry heaving, READING IN THE MORNING??? I guess we got nothing to do 😭😭😭😭 omg made my whole month. THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO SIR 🥲
Last night I dreamt that I was creeping down a decrepit tunnel resident evil style then I was chased by a giant shadow monster with tentacles and I ran into what looked like a weird attic where the shadow monster cornered me and then I woke up  What's that mean huh?
Do billionaires just spend all day drinking different beverages?
Kurtis there's no G in spinach
The "cats" reference felt like foreshadowing...
Your mother.
The dramatic intro. If you know, you know. You go comedy king
Your dream means you have a strong stream. Keep up the good work
This was so awesome and on Time!😅😂🤣
How to be rich, Step 1: don't have a wife, you can't make the bed when your wife is on it
"in conclush-✨✨✨✨✨✨✨-IN CONCLUSION"
I have some pretty sick dreams. I’m happiest when I’m asleep
Nice try Kurtis. But 96 Quite Bitter Beings is in THPS3
I like to imagine there are some days where this guy wakes up and thinks “I’m going to be a bad coach today, I’m gonna trip Jimmy when he runs the lap”
Isn’t hello fresh anti union
this one is so good
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I feel making one’s bed in the morning is always on lists about how to be better but for me, it was giving myself permission to NOT do it. If I don’t have time, it’s ok; nothing to feel bad or guilty about. It’s been good for me.
Oh no I'm feeling happy right now! That isn't scheduled until 5:15PM, this is gonna throw off my whole day
You should make a video about why capitalism has failed us and everything is about to hit the fan
very swag!
I think the doctor dream may be a metaphor actually, mentioning that he needs to eat better, the worms could be like toxic/junk food n the doctor is health being like stop eating junk food idk
Billion dollars is good
Make a video where you just roast billionaires pls🙏🙏🙏
Died at the end
this shit is deranged
nice video!
Oh fuck you've got the same calendar as me
love how this video turned into Kurtis just taking care of himself
is the best way, Kurtis has the hand writing of a 5 year old
one of my eyes closes a bit more than the other KURTIS you body shamed me and I’m not a billionaire
Cold showers are great for your immune system, hair, skin and other stuff. Hot showers can mess you up. That being said, cold showers suck.
Actually Kurtis, there is a pretty cool reason why you should make a note to recall your dreams: when you recall your dreams habitually it makes it a lot easier to do lucid dreaming when you use one of the lucid dreaming techniques. :)
the ending gave me vibes from that meme that has a long list of things you're gonna do and one of those things is "FISH ORGYYY" I don't remember any of the rest of the words, just that part 😭😭
ITS ABOUT DRIVE, ITS ABOUT POWER, WE STAY HUNGRY, WE DEVOUR PUT IN THE WORK, PUT IN THE HOURS AND TAKE WHATS OURS.
petition for a Kurtis Conner architectural digest video
Noel and Nickisnotgreen were the two socialists comedian commentators i knew (Zack Fox is dirtbag-left anarchists, Eric Andre is soc as well, but they are well established comedians), now the Kurtis is here, as well.
ok wasn't expecting something my Jung's therapist would say to be the first step
Kurtis, your dreams clearly show me you want to pee the bed, and I'm here to tell you to stop listening to the haters and go for it!
brb asking my doctor how many worms i should be eating
A KURTIS UPLOAD 2 DAYS BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY LETS GOOOOO
These are all the crazy things I do that allows me successfully keep all the money that has been in my family for the last hundred years!!
19:45 lol you said "b-hole"
Thanks for the permission mayor, i will now body shame every single billionaire 😁🖤
i was offended by the panera apple comment because that’s what i always get but then i remembered my showers do tend to be a bit chilly
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I fucking lost it at beta breathing. My jaw dropped to the floor and I had to pause to process.
Who… who uses water for smoothies….
I turned 25 today and I'm terrified that my "young person" life is coming to an end so this came at the best time to remind me that i will never have the things i want because i will never be a millionaire
okay but his skin and hair look really good after a week
i barely manage to wake up in the morning.
The amount of times I’ve watched the part at 16:03 is criminal 😭😂
“You feel nothing” lol this video had me in tears laughing. Kurtis go on tour in 🇨🇦
this sounds more like an aesthetic tiktok morning routine than a billionaire morning routine
I used to start off with a warm shower then switch it to cold at the end to wake myself up
8:50 And at this point my morning edible has kicked in.
This is Kurtis Conner’s best video. Congart on the biillon dollars!
the opening sequence was immaculate
wow y’all see that plating, what a chef
Dang ur alpha breath stinks 😷 🤢
Kurtis Conner? more like Kurtis Comrade
Yo this is kinda irrelevant but kurtis’ house is so neat and aesthetic. Dunno why but I did not see that coming-
Does anyone know if the be nice to me merch is gonna restock?
ok I'm not sure if ANYONE can relate, but this list sounds like my hyperspecific and overly complicated autistic rituals that have no reason for existing and yet do
2:50
ur already a billionaire just by living in toronto
tysm for the early bday present kurtalina connerta
Maybe try another smoothies and add some honey 👍
“Today you feel nothing.” I felt that
POV: you come to the comments section to look for the dream interpreters interpreting his dreams
Big asterisk on this since Kurtis didn’t buy real brain tea.  The jury is still out on the becoming a billionaire routine…
Cold showers are actually really nice, especially after a work out. But you’re not supposed to have cold water right away lol normally I’ll use warm water for shampooing and stuff, then slowly turn the temperature down until it’s cold. Feels great.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
Comrade Curtis
Remember caffeine is a drug, Mr Kurtis, sir   Lol
You’re the only person that could convince me to make my bed. I am also 27. 🤣
Kurtis, buddy, i think it's time to shave the 80's male pornstar mustache. The hair is also a little much
This man is going to make worms go extinct with how many views he's getting
1st Dream: You feel a steady pull toward advancing your career and taking next steps, but you’re afraid of the fallout and leaving behind who you “used” to be if you do. Choosing to watch Spider-Man was representative of choosing to do something you love and that inspires you and mirrors your own goals, and losing your flight after taking the time to watch it is a reflection of the very separation and loss you’re fearful of.   2nd dream: you had to pee and you’re also afraid of ruining things for no reason but also kind of like that? 👀
ok but is nobody gonna talk about the fact that this “billionaire” guy didn’t mention “brush your teeth” as a part of your morning routine?   like goddamn no wonder Warren Buffett’s teeth look like that
I think I forgot how to breath bc of that technique
Video's great, but I'm confused. Is it weird to be able to control your passive emotions and your feelings for the day? Kurtis brings up the "to feel" list as if he can't control his general attitude during the day.
Dang your alpha breath stinks
comeon man, code dont work here in europe
You can shame these fucks all you want my dude.
I liked the whole vids im always waiting to see your vids and i loved the ed drinking a burger reference
I just want to say you did a great job with this video. Solid, funny, succinct script, great camera work and balanced editing. Great message as well. I see your hard work. Well done.
why do you look more and more like jj mccullough 😭
What he was saying about dreams is a bit true but also misleading. When you dream your mind Is processing information, it's just kinda all random and controlled by your subconscious. Your mind is just processing and storing memories Essentially.
THE BREATHING OMFGGGG
Please please where did you get your “Please be nice to me” shirt! I need it
Let’s gooo
Kurtis, I’m a devoted subscriber. I watch all of your videos. When I clicked on this one, and there WASNT AN EXTRA GREETING, I reconsidered my subscription. Please, don’t do it again. /lh
This was hilarious, I think it's one of my favorite videos of yours. The alpha breathing sounds had me rolling 🤣
Clearly somebody hasn't read Sigmund Freud
This is my favorite video you’ve made so far
His tiny whines because of the cold shower were both funny and adorable in the same time
"you're allowed to body shame a billionaire." spoken like a true king
That was an amazing transition into an ad.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
I literally love how progressive and aware kutis is. It's such a breath of fresh air 😌
Omg I have the same blueberries as kurtis what a small world
I still miss my extra greeting 😔
0;16 its the sequel to 2021"
can i try alpha breathing even though I'm just a female? it looked super relaxing lmao
SHOWER GOALS!!!!!!
okay now someone has to do the anti-billionaire routine… I do NOT volunteer
Kurtis ur handwriting looks like a 6 year olds and I love it
My "morning" routine is: 1. Wake up 2. Go back to sleep 3. Wake up 4. Debate whether or not to call off from work 5. Resist the urge to cry 6. Get up
That smoothie is a crime. You want more fruit to balance the greens, like banana, strawberry or raspberry (as my go-to, when I can afford the time and ingredients) and then a plain greek yogurt. So like blueberry, banana, strawberry, spinach and Greek yogurt, replacing the water with ice. Then it tastes better. Idk about everything else, I'm a broke as f*ck person who can't afford basic healthcare in the US, but I can at least make a better smoothie than a billionaire
Kurtis is looking like a young Weird Al. Love it.
Literally the commentary on the first ten minute is amazing. I can’t stop laughing.
what sucks is how many how to be a millionaire ads i got on this video
I for damn sure am going to do the beta breathing. Nothing like a good laugh to start my morning.
Ps dang your alpha breath stinks!
Yeah Id like more like this and the other ones
Pls drop hellofresh due to recent union busting activities!
Kurtis dw abt meditation lmao I have adhd and I can’t last 1 minute let alone 10
Having a dream journal helps you remember more and more details of your dreams, and that can help you lucid dreaming if you want. I was introduced to meditation by my therapist: it's cool but requires a lot of commitment
loving the "journalling" title card
Did you buy a vitamix for this specifically
Morning routines like this are so disconnected from reality its so telling that these rich people don't know how the average person lives. Anyone who has the time to to all that bullshit every morning is already extremely privileged lol
NOT THE CEDRIC DIGGORY THING- I can't take it
I take cold showers everyday but where i live the coldest it gets is 10°C on really rare occasions lol
That's Jim Kwik , aka "The boy with the broken brain", who made that list. 😁
The pissed off feeling after the cold shower must be how billionaires can stomach all the exploitation of the working class they do
Idk about everyone else but I enjoyed this type of video👀
My morning consists of 12 hours, peasants!
That video was such nonsense, lol. No way that a "billionaire" does that bullshit. They just looked up the morning routine of some health nut chick's blog. Actual billionaires probably have assistants wake them, clothe them and feed them all the solids and liquids their physical existence requires, those old ass slug creatures definitely don't write about their feelings in a journal every morning.
I love when Kurtis goes anti-capitalist
I love how kurtis has a beautiful house because of Jenna but then the room that he films his videos in kinda just looks messy
id on the shirt anyone?
Why is this the hair style all my male Canadian youtubers have 🤣
It's amazing how productive someone can sound when they leave out all the employees they have to take care of mundane tasks. I believe this guy can make his own bed and brew his own tea, it's pretty simple and probably makes him feel self sufficient. But like, who's cooking dinner or buying groceries? Who's doing the laundry? Who's cleaning the bathroom? And if there are any kids, who's getting them ready for school and helping them with their homework? Probably not this dude.
I love the bingo hall of fame joke
kurt we need a conclusion shirt reveal
Also, glad Kurtboy is a better person than me because I defs thought he was just gonna say he'll make the bed with Jenna in it. Like all you'd see is the outline of a body under the covers 😂
breath as if you are giving birth or possibly having a panic attack
I'm already screwed at "recall dreams". I don't remember my fucking dreams, bitch. I woke up like 5 times last night and had a new dream each time I fell asleep.
He does all that every morning… but has never brushed his teeth or washed his face once.
I would like to watch a whole video of Kurtis making fun of rich old (white) guys… like… give me 20 mins of THAT! Seriously dude, body shame those nasty fogies until they want to die and spread their wealth to the masses
I believe kurtis is actually a billionaire because of his shower
“We’re not human doings, we’re human beings.” Was that not a Justin Bieber tweet or am I crazy
Kurtis: *farts* Me: *laughs*
Straight up just put on a cropped t and short shorts and Kurtis will be the spitting image of my father in law in the 80s ba ha ha ha.
"to be a billionaire you have to exploit the working class" oh shit Kurtis is class conscious
why was that smoothie so chunky tho O.o
box breathing is ACTUALLY a coping skill a therapist might teach you and i 100% recommend it for strong emotions like anger, anxiety, etc
Bruh that alpha breathing had me dying cause i knew i looked just as crazy 😂
"You can body shame a billionaire as a treat"  Gotta listen to the mayor
i’m so sorry this is incredibly off topic but i love your dog so much what a cutie oh my god. the stretching at ljke 11:40 or something had me crying actually so. so. so cute. i cant stand it.
"market cap"
We drink water we devour...wow
Step 16: Nap
billionaires are so out of touch with their own humanity that they have to intellectualize their feelings and make them separate from themselves by putting them on a piece of paper. they've turned every aspect of existence into a goal u can hustle for. also it's so easy to make a smoothie that actually tastes good, why would use plain water when u could use almond milk, coconut water, orange juice? come on dude
I had a dream I made swimsuits for cats...is that my billionaire life calling???
Sigma more like ligma
I feel like not reading the communist manifesto or das kapital by karl marx during the reading a book parts is such a missed opportunity lol. I loved the way you casually included some key concepts of class conflict and class consciousness for your younger or less political viewers, who might be inspired by this video to learn more about socialist theory and how capitalists exploit them. I love so many of your videos but this one is truly one of your greatest bangers.
The shirt at 15:40 is BAD ASS.
one of my fav videos i’ve seen on youtube in a while. luv u kurty boi!
26:44
good things in fact, do not grow in ontario !!!!!!
14:30 You know what tastes great after moving your body for two minutes? Wattainyehands! Wattainyehands: make a mess!
KURTIS WHY AFTER YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT THE PEE ON THE CORNER OF YOUR BED DREAM AND YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA GO GET SOME WATER DID IT SEEM LIKE… you were actually going to do it 💀 I spit out my drink laughing
the intro would have been 1000% more funny if you wore an NFT shirt talking about Elon and Mark (it was still funny btw)
5 minutes in and he’s already compromising. billionaires don’t compromise for anyone
hi
This guys video just proves billionaires do shit all to actually get the money they have. Like if he actually was working anywhere near hard enough to actually earn billions of dollars he would not have any time to do any of this bullshit
your house is beautiful curtis
I can see the headline now: millionaire pretends he is billionaire
dang your alpha breath stinks kurti :/
In my notifications I thought this said “living like a balloon animal for a day” and wow I was a little confused about the new direction kurtis’ content was taking
*raises hand* can we get a 15 minute video of you just making fun of old rich dudes and ladies pls
I AM WISEST BILLIONAIRE
any video you make ill watch
I love new communist Kurtis
holy crap, i love billionaires ironically now
Not once did he mention drinking milk. Those billionaires bones are soooft.
Don’t lie, this is our actual routine:  1) *Go Back To Bed*
Alpha breathing is fucking horrifying
LOL THE CKY WHILE PLAYING TONY HAWK I LOVE KURTIS LITTLE JOKES LIKE THAT
Unrelated but if thats his house he has top tier design and furniture taste
why do men write like that 😭
LMFAO I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
loved this video and especially loved the editing! the comedic timing was so spot on
Yas! Kurtis smashing that capitalism. ✊🏼
tbh I used to shit on using leafy greens in smoothies, but legit mix it in with some berries and you don't even notice it but you're still getting a ton of vegetables in your diet. That smoothie he mentioned actually sounded alright to me
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Didn’t think I’d ever hear Kurtis calling himself a cuck but here we are
Opinion: life is too short to take only cold showers
kaboom
Kurtis hating cold showers is offensively Taurus
"I could just do a video making fun of rich old guys"  I'm listening.
alpha breathing killed me
Cosmic brownies and Mountain Dew 😭😭😭
"I'll be evading my taxes like crazy" 😂 it's better to laugh than to cry am I right
Mt.Dew and cosmic brownies were my favorite meal when I was a kid  and yes I was very overweight 🙃
If I ever become successful enough to be asked to make a morning routine video I would straight up lie just to see people trying to do the absurd things I told them I do. “First thing when I wake up I chug a gallon of milk and immediately after I start running in place for 30 minutes, if you throw up that’s normal don’t worry about it just keep going . When I’m done with that I read at least 7 self help books, just to open my day on a positive note. By this point I might get a little hungry so I eat 5 bowls of fruit loops and 2 dozen raw eggs #health and begin day drinking so I can concentrate on something other than how the world is collapsing and it’s in big part my fault” etc
kurtis u r so fucking funny i love you
12:33 that just means you pissed the bed pal. Glad I could help 💛
Why are none of the comments regarding Curtis's "Special Greeting" at the beginning of the vids. Really missing that special greeting right about now.
no but did he just put unwashed spinach in his brain smoothie ;-;
watching while baked and i love your edits rn
I showed my friend this video and they said that they didn't like it. We're not friends anymore
dude nice house bro
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I don’t know what he’s dreaming about but my dreams are definitely not my subconscious trying to fix my awake problems. Half of my dreams I’m naked in the middle of my high school so I don’t think that’s helping anybody.
2022 the year of complaining
U and oompaville look so similar with that sick hairdo
Fuck yeah Kurtis! Viva la revolucion!
Awww kurtis & I are matching 🥰
hey kurtis, that alpha breathing bit? fckn terrifying. never sleeping again. love the video!
Runs dead
It looks like bezos might have a lazy right eye? If you cover one and then the other it looks like they're looking two different directions lol lizard person confirmed
This was amazing😂😂🥰 the editing thoo😻💞
I agree... I have some pretty stupid dreams. But like. Dreaming of eating worms means you're burnt out apparently.🤷‍♀️
Right now I'm takin a shit and also I'm stoned. Ontario Buds 🤘
i want more of these videos
We're cracking jokes about how billionaires look now? I love it.
Feel like this is made for people “searching” for a job.
Smoothies contain ice and most of the time yogurt or a juice or both. So. You Didn’t drink a smoothie
i write my dreams down because they are plot heavy and SO WACK and it helps me make art and stories 👍fuck regular journaling though lol
Kurtis never fails to look exactly like a character on the show stranger things named Anthony Keiđis
KURTIS NOT MR DIGGORY
“To feel lists” are for soulless sociopaths or androids becoming self aware! lol
No one: Literally no one at all: Morning routine guy: My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Bozos literally has the money to fix his eye. Body shame away.
next video is kurtis trying the anti-billionaire morning routine
Kurt what does ur shirt say
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Is kurtis a marxist now? Lets hope he isnt a libertarian. Go Juche!
the ending w the opposite of the morning routine made me laugh so hard i cried
15:55-16:13 killed me the first time I saw it and still makes me laugh after 200 replays😂 Kurtis' face while basically willingly burning his tongue with the brain tea is deadly ahaha and the non sense mumble>>>>>
Can we take a moment to appreciate how amazing kurtis' shower head is? Omg I need that.
Curtis should've  just ate like Warren buffe. That would be fun☺/s
dang ur alpha breath stinks
What he says at 16:02 is truly eye-opening. Wow.
When I take cold showers, I start warm then tho down, but don’t turn it all the way cold, more just under room temperature.
Lion's Mane tea do be doing something but I dunno if they carry it where you live
i always pictured you as a right side of the bed guy,
Kurtis is Praxis
When Kurtis was rejecting… it was highkey clean
✊✊✊
Kurtis didn't get it. Billionares are billionares because they don't use hot water.
I've heard somewhere that turning the shower to cold water before getting out and after washing in hot water is good for you. Not sure how or why that is but 🤷‍♂️
Please release the full video of your showers
So wait this guy doesn't go to the bathroom or shower in the morning? Das suspicious.
i like this it's different
i love this type of content honestly
"I do my breathing"
Make Kurtis President 2024? 2025? Whenever the next election is. Time doesn't exist rn.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude had a fart reveal
6:18 reminds me of the weird rich guy in dont look up
IM EARLYYY HIII!!!!
Billionaires do not “exploit the working class.” Just the opposite. This channel has become anti-science garbage.
Your house looks so nice and your plants look real happy
I should warn you to add pineapple to the leafy green smoothie, it really helps! My favorite is cup spinach, half a frozen banana, a handful of frozen blueberries, few chunks of pineapple and Half-a cup if water. Measurement are estimated :) hope you like it!
kurtis thought he could hide the fact that he shops at superstore, but i know, i am also canadian 🤨
2:00    4:15     26:45
I can interpret your dreams for you Kurtis! I am board certified in the process! The dreams of peeing as well as being stuck in LA and missing Spiderman are indicative of you needing…. TO CUT YO FUCKING HAIR DUDE!! Seriously, every time I watch you I keep thinking Im watching a ‘hick’ extra from a lost episode of LETTERKENNY! jk 😜 FYI love your content! But… CUT YO HAIR DAMMIT!!! LOL Cheers!
This reminds me of the weekly corporate email with helpful destressing tips from our CEO when I can only imagine his struggle, us making over a billion dollars last year.
I feel called out for the apple at panera and a sleeve of saltines… time to eat 28k worms, Kurtis
I liked this video Kurtis 👍🚒🔥
I mostly just quietly laugh at jokes these days, but the "beta breathing" line got me to laugh so loud I startled myself. Thanks Kurtis!
dang your alpha breath stinks
His shower is so sick what the hell
My parents were listening from the background and were cracking up
I was fucking crying at those Warren Buffet jokes oml kurtis please make an entire video just bullying billionaires
💲
I mean Paul Mccartney is only worth 1.3 billion dollars, which is still a lot of money, but he was in THE most famous band of all time and he's the only muscian to make a billion dollars just from his music so clearly there's a little more to making 200 billion dollars then hard work lol
well last night i dreamt that i was in the film about the kid with a lambs head and i was genuinely convinced that i had watched that film until 4pm so what does that say about my goals and what im working on?
I give that Tony Hawk joke a 96%. It was funny but made me quite bitter
this was a great video u should do more videos like this :-) also i tried the mountain dew smoothie and now i grew into a mountain. all in a day's work for a future billionaire💯
This morning routine is close to impossible for anyone who’s actually working hard and doesn’t have four hours to mediate, journal, read, and consume a variety of drinks
Kurtis, recalling your dreams is useful in order to have lucid dreams. They may be weird and all but they are the doorway to lucidity and infinite opportunities to do while lucid.
I really enjoyed this style of video!
10 minutes in and this is one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen, good shit Kurtis
This video is pure art
For someone who talked about how much they need coffee, I was really impressed at Kurtis‘s ability to not whine about being up early and being tired like a lot of these videos that I’ve watched!
IM BODY SHAMING BILLIONARES  RN
can't wait for hasan to watch this
so many ppl uploading today,,,, danny, jacob, noel and now kurtis
In a dream, eating worms typically symbolizes fatigue and burnout, so given that’s a thing that a lot of big YouTubers struggle with, that might make sense
great you’re improving yourself, Kurt! I won’t
I really liked this video
26:44 LMDAOOOOOOO DUDEEEE I LEGIT COULDN'T BREATHE, THAT HAD ME DYINGG
First of all Sudoku is fucking lit, it's fun to do math, my boi😌
bingo hall of fame is so good omfg
Some people do ligma breathing
i have ASD and had a meltdown, when i saw kurty boy posted i felt a bit less AHHHHHHHHZHDGJGDS.  after it was over i watched this and i really enjoyed it. thanks Kurtis
Not very fond of the phrasing "tall glass of water"
Could we get a video of you roasting rich old guys? I think that would be fun, you could get people to make requests for certain rich guys
Becoming a billionaire isn't about being smart or diligent, it's how far you're willing to go to get that wealthy, aka ready to throw all of the working class under a bus to get there
I never thought I’d get called out for getting an apple at Panera
21:10 this is genuinely one of the things I do almost every morning 😭cuz later they are fun to look at in the future
Here's a great way to become a billionaire; Marry one, kill them with poison, bribe the justice system if necessary
The b in billionaire stands for body shaming
“r-Rihanna..? loser ?”
This is like when a creator has so many video traditions it takes up the whole video.
this is my new favourite video
comrade kurtis
Seeing Asher Roth pop up like that is so weird, I know him solely for the fact that we have same first name. Honestly just my name in general on the internet is weird
LOL nobody has this kind of time in the morning
You walked your dog, Kurtis. You did move your body for two minutes
Your hair is exquisite
why does your comment section have so many sex bots?
8:39 no that's routine for people who has more then 24 hours in there day
🤣🤣 they said breathe in and hold.... All I hear is hyperventilating
i have such vivid disturbing dreams, would prefer to not remember them!
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I'm jealous of your Canadian Hello Fresh options LOL I'm in America and use Hello Fresh already and I've never been offered most of the meals you showed. Beef tacos with rice and feta cheese? Sounds delish but never seen it on my app. How rude
This was so funny!
Sick dance moves Mayor.
You know who takes cold showers and loves them? Me! BUT I LIVE IN RIO DE JANEIRO AND IT'S SUPER HOT HERE What kinda garbage advice is "take a cold shower", jesus christ
Okay but I love the interior decorating! That bed frame is fire!
I hope you forget what note book you wrote the horny to do list in and Jenna finds it one day
Your mullet looks phenomenal in this video
yasss marxist kurtis come through
this was a slay video
Bro you need to continue to write down your dreams and put them into a movie
Honestly a to-feel list still sounds like meditation, not gonna lie
I keep trying to comment but I keep seeing the bullshit that Kurtis needs to do and losing my train of thought
I will be nice to you Yokurt, thank you for asking politely
Kurtis's opposite smoothie sounds like something Warren Buffet would drink on the regular.
I have taken cold showers before and I see their appeal SOMETIMES. The way I do it though is to start with warmish water and then slowly make it cold. It can make you feel awake and ready for the day if you do it right and are in the right mood. Definitely not for everyone though.
this sounds like the routine my therapist made me do but it just made me more miserable
you make a to-feel list, and you leave it blank... today you feel nothing.
"you feel nothing today" I wish Kurtis...I wish
This is the shit they made us do in all of the mental hospitals I have conquered
I like how kurtis didn't google "brain smoothie" recipes to make something that didn't taste like ass and just subjected himself to an approximation of a vague description in a video
Beta breathing slayed me🤣😂
i hope kurtis put "improve handwriting" on his to do list
Gotta love Mr. Douggie with his lockdowns
Kurtis's updated billionaire routine is like having a toddler. Thomas the engine, mountain dew for breakfast... ✅✅
Wanted to help you out with your dream interpretations (I have an MS in forensic psych so I'm qualified to speak on this)  You want Spiderman to pee on you - I don't make the rules, sorry
Kurtis: I drink too much… Me: oh no alcohol? Kurtis: …coffee… Me: oh oh never mind Kurtis: …and WINE Me: OH
The alpha breathing guy sounds EXACTLY like the billionaire guy in Don’t look up lmaooo
what i learned from this video is that kurtis has a pretty apartment
wow rude i had an apple from panera today this is targeted harassment
Jesus Christ dude, that warren buffet joke (2:15) hit me like a fucking train. Holy shit😂😂😂😂
This was so funny at 1.5 speed. Why specifically 1.5 speed? Idk I watch all videos at that speedm
*I'm broke as hell but I literally do all these things almost everyday.*
i think alpha breathing is what insouke uses
You made me remember Asher Roth and I don't know how I feel about that
Can you also do a video making fun of rich old guys? Lol jk
as a years long fan of kurtis ive gotta say i was so shocked to realise that hes actually rich and has a really nice house,, i kinda forgot he's actually a famous youtuber and not just some guy in a room
spinnage 😟
you should put your hand writing font on merch
you should put your hand writing font on merch
So this is why you haven’t posted for the last week..
my roommates and I have the exact same water purifier as you do, Kurtis, and I don't like that
The alpha breath sequence is your best work yet
the dark part in the middle of kurtis’s mustache looks like a little tiny eboy haircut
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I dunno if I've just never looked at Kurtis, but I swear to god I never knew his eyes were blue wtf. I feel like my life is a lie, I thought his eyes were brown, my brain is breaking I'm so confused 😕
Actually controlling your emotions is possible. After attending DBT for 3 years (twice a week for half a year, once a week the rest) I was able to better recognize emotions (as well as distinguish anxiety from gut feelings), prevent panic attacks by recognizing them ahead of time and doing skills to calm down and manage my emotions. Obviously you need money to go to therapy, which sucks ass and I had to stop going due to insurance issues, but honestly it does help. Also eating healthier and sleeping more + less online time manages gut bacteria which helps improve moods. I'm trying to develop a DBT app with stuff I learned in therapy to give to people for free.
What was that Tony Hawk Pro Skater song called?
dang, ur alpha breath stinks
aw sleepy kurtis is adorable
I actually use Headspace. There are some 3 minute meditations, (and 5, 10, 15 and the 20 one Kurtis did). And there are some meditations aimed at kids that I feel are way easier to follow when my brain can't handle the regular ones. (headspace non-sponsored ad over, lol)
You look very canadian when youre tired 🤨
i dont even think patrick bateman took cold showers
idk if this is weird but kurtis's house is very nicely decorated
Ugh man I love Danny Gonzalez and Drew Gooden but this video is showing me how much you don't know. It's sad to see how absolutely well the left's propaganda message has settled itself in your psyche. It's no business of your how much money someone has. The fact that you even care what bezos net worth is shows your ignorance. He can't go to the bank and withdraw 2 Billion dollars. His money is tied up in his company. He'd have to sell it to get that money. And he gets more of the profit because he also holds the risk. You as an employee could walk out and get another job anytime. His business is his life. And your labor is worthless without the company in the first place to provide something for you to do for pay. And becoming successful is something some people are serious enough about to bust their ass to achieve it, and people who aren't serious won't do the hard work. And who the fuck do you think is going to sacrifice their time on such a massive scale to create a company if there's no incentive? If dicks like people who think like this will just decide "oh you have too much money. I want it so I'll use the government to take it from you?" People don't think shit through. "Oh rich guy bad!" Our society would collapse without wealthy people paying taxes, giving to charity, and investing. If noone is allowed to acquire wealth who the fuck's gonna pay for everything? Do a modicum of research including some right wing sources you probably would never look into because the left has told you the right's racist and you believe them, but if you took a gander, you'd see that the right actually looks at the facts and statistics and imperical evidence and can support their positions without posturing. But you won't even look cause you already know everything, right?
I appreciate that you called out these billionaires. Like if they gave their money back to most of the rest of us, ya know since they won't go through most of it before they die
this is, dare i say, the best video kurtis has made to date
All of these morning rituals have one thing in common, they all have an ad built in
I just want to say i found out who warren buffet was like last week and my first reaction was "PEOPLE LIKE THAT STILL EXIST??"
i couldn’t even pay attention to the video, i was too distracted by kurtis’s GORGEOUS mullet
This all reminds me of the shit we'd do at phych wards during group therapy, they'd make us meditate and give us journal entries and it sucked 💀
“Dang your alpha breathes stinks” Yes I read the description of a  Kurtis Conner video🕴🏻
Kurt you probably have the best video ideas. It's like you have perfect elevators pitchs. Love your vids man
“This video could just be me making fun of rich, old guys.” Please, I’m all the way down for that. Like bedrock. Do it.
this is unrelated but the decor of kurtis' house is so cute... it's very artistic and tasteful
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
I wanted to offer an alternative view on your sells. Although not the exact ones in the video, those were lame as fuck.  There are a few of your sells that I personally enjoy with modifications. For instance, good breathing techniques actually have a lot of benefits to them. My personal favorite is Wim Hof breathing, which when done properly will oxygenate your body to a point where it is like a mild high, and has lots of benefits for metabolism and energy. If you look up Wim Hof breathing he has a site that will give you the basic rundown, and I think it's good to do. He also uses it in conjunction with cold exposure and really cold showers as a way of boosting his cold resistance, which actually works. He was recorded sitting in a tub of ice for two hours without losing any body temperature, and also hiked MT. Kilimanjaro in his shorts in record time. Cold showers still suck though, but I do enjoy a cool shower in warmer seasons. Definitely not in winter though fuck that. Also, I'm personally a tea person and I try not to drink lots of caffeine, so I definitely vibe with the tea. Usually I'll do a green tea for a lower amount of caffeine, or yerba mate for a higher amount. I also enjoy journaling. I wouldn't do it every day because frankly my life isn't full enough to write about interesting things that often, but it's really nice to put your thoughts to paper periodically. I've noticed it's a healthy outlet for bottled up emotions. As for smoothies, the best ones are with high quality apple juice. I'm a Coloradoan, and we have Big B's apple cider here which makes, on my life the best smoothies out there. They also have a cold pressed version that is literally just juice squeezed from apples and bottled, no pasteurization. If you're in Colorado I definitely recommend. The regular juice is more common, but the cold pressed is only in stores from like September to December and only really at Whole Foods. Still worth a trip imo.
I like cold showers in summer but I gotta start with hot then just gradually make it colder
Exactly today, I thought "hey it would be a good idea to make a video about following *entrepreneur* routines" Then Kurtis posts this video and does it better than anyone else would
I LIKE THIS VIDEO DAD
You made me choke on a chicken nugget
i tried to do the alpha breathing and i couldn't make it two seconds of hold without laughing
demon slayer: fire breathing, water breathing, sound breathing, me, a billionaire: alpha breathing
very good video kurtis
i would absolutely love more like this!!! this is probably a new favorite of your vids for me :)
kurtis you're brave for speaking the truth on this one and you should say it
cool
Idk why I forgot Kurtis is a person who does everyday things seeing him do normal stuff is strange to me
please make more videos like this
It is irresponsible to lump Elon Musk into the group of other billionaires. Government regulation and corrupt billionaires are the ones that keep everyone from becoming rich
Pretty sure I saw you breathing before you were supposed to. No wonder it didn’t work
that breathing technique almost gave me a panic attack
Was anyone else afraid of watching the video when he was alpha breathing
11:23 Big Billionaire Secret: he does ALL of these things before taking his morning pee and subsequent morning dump. *This* is what separates us from the billionaires, I finally get it.
Am I the only one who gets stressed by breathing exercises? 1234568910 oops have to exhale faster oops now I inhaled too fast, how many breaths did I take just now. Like that
The happiest people are those who can kill a person for their spleen just for fun and get away with it.
The bourgeois make great compost
GELP
please for the love of god don't watch the cats movie
this made me laugh aloud so many times ty
Kurtis, you realize you’re a millionaire, right?
Hi
he played one millisecond of 96 quite bitter beings and that made me wanna say thank you for showing CKY some love because they are great.  (dyslexia eh?)
his home sick af
Ebolarized crispies
Omg kurtis i have that exact sweatshirt that’s crazy !!!
my mother like to bath every day on cold water with ice
Can we talk about how cute Kurtis and Jenna’s place is 🥺
Yea, kurtis I already do your morning routine. Morning routine? More like mourning routine
That fart means your body was totally relaxed You need to start a cold shower with room water temp. Let it build and rub your skin to help acclimate to the temp. They do work and I'm just middle class
bruh none of my pc stores carry the pc frozen blueberries rn
*breaks up with partner* sorry bro I have to do this I forgot to write "be a good partner" on my to-be list today
sir you are not blending your smoothies for nearly long enough--there should not be visible chunks still in there, ew
I NEVER WANT TO WATCH YOU ALPHA BREATH AGAIN  that was so scary kurtis
I mean, billionaires own hotels. You also talked about making your bed for the routine. Pissing on a hotel bed seems to be a pretty straight forward way your brain would say ‘F*ck this sh*t and these people🙂’
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Some of the stuff in the routine are actually good for your mental health, like meditation and journaling. The issue is the lie that this is what makes billionaires rich. Kurtis put it eloquently: this isn't a routine for people who want to become billionaires, this is a routine for people who are already billionaires.
Imagine walking in on him breathing like that w/o context XD
im gonna go do 20 minutes of medication
I will never be a billionaire. I mean, no coffee? Oh hell no. Plus, I have ADD, so I can meditate for like 2 minutes (seriously). Is this guy for real anyway? Holy marmalade!!
I'm not even going to like Kurtis's more experimental videos. Don't get me wrong, I love the commentary, but I like how he does different types of content that is still enjoyable.
You should be worried about inflation too
Worm dream interpretation: you are worried about your health and don’t know what to do. You’re already doing the wrong things and getting bad advice on how to change.
YouTube “billionaires” spend all day getting ready for their day.
IDK if this means anything but a lot of your dreams are just you being afraid of something - you wanna explore that, chief?  Also - unrelated to the video but your apartment looks GORGEOUS and i'd love a tour of all those plants!
deadass the breathing thing made me laugh out loud every single time that shit is HILARIOUS
Journaling is not usually a "to feel list or to be list". Also just cause your to dumb to understand journaling doesn't mean it's stupid. It just means your to dumb to understand it hahaha.
I lost it when he said he does his breathing💀
*I had a dream last night lil nas x tried to drown me in my grandmas pool :))*
Alpha breathing Kurtis activated my fight-or-flight response.
Now a want to take a hot shower just out of spite of cold showers.
4:44 Kurtis, even though it was most likely a joke I love psychoanalyzing dreams haha, I personally believe it’s your subconscious or your ancestors speaking to you about stuff in your waking life, whether it’s good or bad haha  and I’m one of those people that have premonitions from my dreams as well.   You dreamt about a doctor telling you to stop eating worms and doctors can represent healers and eating worms more often then not represents fatigue and burnout. I would like to say to me it represents your higher self getting mad at you for over working/stressing yourself and telling to you rest and relax. O:  Obviously I don’t know you or your life and I obviously can’t speak for you or what you’re going through outside of the internet persona you show us but again I enjoy trying to find deeper meanings in dreams and to me that’s what’s it sounding like. Not to make things “deep” or anything just my interpretation. It could just be a doctor getting mad at u for eating worms lol.
"She kept saying 'Kurtis, what are you doing, you woke me up' which is weird because she doesnt usually talk in her sleep." Absolute grade A comedy gold, ma boy.
Tired: Eating the rich and starving the wealthy Wired: Shoving billionaires into a locker and riding it down a mountain
i laughed so hard watching this video
ngl hearing kurtis describe wage theft in a way that's very digestible to a huge audience is very cool
kurt lowkey sturdy
Sometimes I forget just how funny Kurtis is. Love this guy
Earlyyyy
Hell yea, I want more videos like this!
love the interior design in ur home
tries to become a billionaire but literally misspells “journaling” 23:45
This BS reminds me so much of when I was in that door to door MLM sales job in college. Don't get me wrong, I love having goals and meditating, but the idea of taking care of myself for the sake of MONETARY GAIN??? That's not how it works?!?!?!  Edit: I forgot the cold shower part and I do agree they suck but I did actually do that for a while when my back was really bad and believe it or not, you kinda get used to it. It wasn't cold for the whole shower though. I'd wash in warm water and then turn the water down to rinse off.
we want more videos if every kind, to be clear
Kurtis has never made or had a smoothie ever 😂😂😂
kurtis’ handwriting looks like a 5 yr old’s
Jeff would be proud.
I journal on Facebook about people that talk shit about me. It doesn't have anyone on it that follows it so technically it is to myself. But I leave comments public cause I don't care if anyone sees them. So technically I talk shit about people to myself (that talked shit about me or people that have screwed me over). So it can be a healthy way to channel frustration. If people care enough to look at it then that's all up to them. If people care so much about my life that they want to read what i write cool. Go ahead cause I could care less. People tall shit about me to other people so there is a very little difference between what they are doing and what I am doing.
i want that tea mug rn. give it here mister
KURTIS DID A FART REVEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how did that man find so many stock videos 💀
FINALLY
Why did I get an ad for a stone hand towel.
I love this video but whats with ur handwriting kurtis
Is Kurtis taking bodyshaming tips from nickisnotgreen? How to be a piece of shit 101?
4:14 I write down my dreams too, not to be rich, but to show my friends how unhinged my subconscious is
Fistful of cosmic brownies smoothie
dang ur alpha breath stinks kurtis ew
Fun thing I learned from this: billionaires have to consciously experience emotions. That is all I have learned
okay but can we talk about how pretty kurtis’ house is
Kurtis, you look super cool
Wait go back to the roasting of the billionaires 😂
Hey man? Why did you explain my morning routine? Hmm???
The Kurtis New Year's Curse has been set in motion
can't wait to try the real routine. That smoothie sounds fire.
I loved that video! You did a great job! Very hilarious
Does anyone else think that Kurtis looks like William Dafoe or is it just me?
Kurtis you make me so happy, I will never feel sad when watching your videos. Especially since my parents are going through a divorce right now and we have to move houses, it feels like you are one of the only things that will stay the same. Even if you change your video style it will never not feel like Kurtis Conner, thank you so much for making this part of your career and helping so many people in such a hard time. 💕
yall gotta get a lifestraw pitcher bro
You know you've seen the Raimi Spiderman trilogy too many times when you can recognize the jumpscare sound at 6:50
Ontario represent!
Pt 2 to this video where kurtis does that opposite routine he described at the end
i want kurtis to do 1 day of his 'real billionaires routine' lmaoo
that blender is like $500
Kurtis gives me wine aunt vibes, i have no clue why
“Like a cool business lion”
I once had a dream about pitbull as a balloon on the tonight show— what on earth would that be a solution to? What would that help at all?
What happens to the ghosts when the earth explodes?
Honestly these days Jeff Bezos looks like he could probably pick me up and stuff me in a locker. Bro looks jacked.
I love that Danny and Drew are like im kinda woke and Kurtis is like 'fuck capitalism"
Honestly the cold shower thing seems like 99% LA bs. If you live in a part of the world that freezes over for a few months per year, there's no need to subject yourself to cold showers in order to feel something.  Okay rant over, in all honesty, I sometimes believe 'cold' might just mean 'not warm' so maybe like luke warm. I have noticed that it's better for my hair if I rinse out the conditioner with water that is not scalding hot like the rest of my shower and it feels nice on my face too.
Oh my god... four arm tattoo.... forearm tattoo... i just got it...
You’re the Youtuber Your alrea.dy  ric 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cold showers are for *betas.* Only *Alphas* take hot showers. 🤙🏻🤙🏻💪🏻
Use this as a button for Kurtis to try the *real* billion-dollar morning routine 26:26.
Brain smoothies is the name of my new band
2020 with cheese
Please review the Cats movie 😂😂😂
The fact that you didn't count taking your son out to make poo poo as your body movement is poor people thinking
based
My favorite KillaKay is it okay if I come over to you and you were able to get her to you and I can do it in the morning and get it back to you and I will be there in about it to get her to you and I will be there in about a half hour or so I can do it in the morning and get it back to you and I can come get you if you want to go to the house and get it back from the festival and I can come up with the trailer and I can do it in the morning and get it back up and get it back up and get it back up and get it back up and get it back up there and we can go to the store and get it back up there and we can go to the store and get it back up there and we can go to the store and get it back up there and we can go to the store and get it back up there and we can go to the store and get it figured out if you want to come over and get it figured out for the truck
almost spit my soup at the “to-feel list” bit
kurtis ur handwriting sucks
Anyone else actually try Kurtisssss’s version of the billionaire routine??
The "How to Feel" list seems nutty, but emotional intelligence research might actually support it.  Emotionally intelligent people identify what feelings would be helpful, and seek out those feelings.    For example, if something bad happens, you might feel discouraged.  Being discouraged might lead to giving up.  Emotionally intelligent people identify that feeling energized, flexible, or optimistic might be more helpful, and then they take action designed to help them feel that way, like listening to a motivational podcast, brainstorming options with a friend, or praying.  So you can't just flip a 'feelings' switch, but you can do things to help you get the feelings you want.  #mentalhealthnerd #thanksforcomingtomyTEDtalk
just gonna point this out: you can make fun of the appearance of people you dont like, but theyre never gonna see it or care. you know who will see it? people who like and support you, but happen to have the traits you make fun of. your insults will not reach your target, just hurt people who have done nothing wrong.
uhm, okay - i love your bedroom decor. where i can has bonsai wall things? and your blanket? and fluffy, live, bed decoration?
Kurtis Connor spreading that good good class conciousness 🙌
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Journal: A clean gay Kurtis: “a clean boy” Me: oh
man that to do list looked like a family guy joke
Literally made a to-list list lmao
Kurtis's handwriting looks exactly like what I would imagine it to be
I LITERALLY DIED AT THIS WHOLE VIDEO 😂THANK YOU I NEEDED A LAUGH🙏🏻!!
Thinking about how I would just watch Kurtis body shame billionaires for 30 minutes straight. Make it a podcast special. We all want it.
I had to do an sticker of that brilliant man teaching us how to alpha breathe at 6:36 I already can feel my bank account starting to grow!!
no way Kurits put CKY in a vid lol
it’s the most wonderful time of the week
Yeah, as if being the mayor of KurtisTown doesn't come with trillions of dollars 🙄
Kurtis I’m in the worst shape of my life it’s something I want to work on. Also Kurtis move for two minutes that more exercise then I get all week.
I love a good cold shower sometimes but I also have relatively high tolerance to cold (which also means I die when the outside temperature goes above 30°C. I don't sweat, it's very hard to make me sweat, I just get miserable in heat very quickly). I think if you don't have that and don't enjoy the cold at all they've gotta be fucking miserable!
YES!! NEW KURTIS VIDEO YAAAY
Comrade Kurtis
lolll  the dream advice is not bad actually.  usually we process our emotions through dreams, even if they seem nonsensical.  try it sometime, just ask yourself why.  this is hilarious though don't get me wrong XD ~
the breathing section will give me nightmares, and that's really gonna upset me when im recalling my dreams Kurtis >:(
kurtis dreaming about a big spaceship on the moon is actually a sign he is evolving into a billionaire nemesis of elon musk
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I do t understand what kurtis’s logic on black billionaires is. Just because you are black you should have some magical ability to have innovative ideas that people will be interested in? Just because you are black you should have more chances to become billionaire? His sjw mentality kinda weird
guess I'll never be a billionaire because that morning list is longer than my things i do in a week list
I had a dream that the KKK, tried to get me, a POC, to join them; I said no and walked away 💀💀✋🏽
I had a dream that I was tying my shoe laces once. Oh, and also zombies and spiders. I’m not even afraid of spiders
Alpha breathing = mouth breathing  Yeah ok, that checks out.
You look like every dad from the 80s in the photos you find hidden in your attic thinking to yourself, “wow my dad used to be handsome.”  Edit: they go about the cold shower the wrong way. The ends of my showers are always cold (on purpose), but I very gradually, over the course of 2-3 minutes turn it down. It mostly just wakes me up and makes the frigid weather not feel so bad. I could never just start and take a straight cold shower. I also don’t really see the benefit unless you’re like me and cold just helps you wake up.
you talking about your dream of pissing the bed just reminds me of your show when you mentioned pissing in the basket of jenna’s roommate lmaooo
im in the middle of nowhere trying to find signal to watch the video,, two hours and i finally get it
Sorry but Kurtis is just so freaking cute😍😍😍
YO LETS GO ANOTHER KURTIS VIDEO
a dream about ur dr getting mad at u for eating too many worms means u feel ur doing something ur not proud of/think is unhealthy in ur waking life, and ur worried about it being held against you by a figure in ur life u view with some kind of authority
I’d watch the whole thing lol
CAN ANYONE. ANYONE AT ALL. TELL ME WHAT SONG IS PLAYING AT THE TONY HAWK PART 😭
"you'd get fired" oh, kurtis, if only it were so easy. i have a coworker (i work at a movie theater) and we're pretty understaffed, so my manager isn't willing to let him go, but he sucks at everything he does, so moral of the story is work at a very understaffed place, and you can do 3 things and not get fired /j
Your bedroom setup is absolutely poggers so pretty!!
I want more content like this. Also, dream interpretation is real and not in a crystal-wearing-hippy way.  Like, in a legitimate psychological way. (I took dream interpretation in my masters program!)
This is a  routine of someone that doesn't have a job. I get up make tea (that I drink at work) and catch the bus. And that's it
In this episode, a rich guy makes fun of richer guys because capitalism bad.
Did you know Kurtis has a double??? Youtuber Kaz Rowe, separated at birth?!?!?!
I like to think of us Ontarians (I don't know if that's what we called but I'm going with it) in a semi lockdown.  It's lockdown but not as locked down as the other lockdowns.  If that make sense.  Probably not lol
dang ur alpha breath stinks 😕
A couple notes I’d like to make are; you absolutely do not have to take a FREEZING cold shower 😅 just a cool shower can be really really good for you. And the smoothie should absolutely have more ingredients 😂 this was a really fun video!
The amount of good takes here makes me happy
Did anyone else know instinctively that there was gonna be a fart noise as soon as they heard "notice the sounds around you"?? Also! The Kurtistown mug? I need it
According to economist Robert Reich there are 5 ways to become a Billionaire  - creating a monopoly  - insider trading - political payoffs - fraud - inheritance  You're welcome! Just saw it in a video today. Remember kids if you don't have your health you don't have anything, everyone's shit stinks and we all die in the end, money isn't everything!
Of course there’s gonna be less black people with old money, civil rights wasn’t that long ago. If black people would like to have more black billionaires, they can generate wealth and pass it down generation to generation starting right now :-) that’s what I’m trying to do with this life time- become wealthy and pass it down
A local coffee place offers a blueberry spinach smoothie and it was a hot summer day so a smoothie sounded great. I  couldn't really imagine the flavor, but I thought "sure, since this is a thing they sell for real human dollars, someone tasted this and thought 'this is the flavor of something people would like to buy'."   No. It's not. Blueberries don't have flavor, lets be real. The spinach adds a little bitterness, but it doesn't even taste like spinach. I got oatmilk, so oat was the primary flavor I got...so it was a giant cup of greige bitter oat sludge. It wasn't undrinkable or anything, it was just like liquid cardboard. Sure some strawberries and pineapple won't entirely counteract the brain benefits, right?
12:24 this is CLEARLY your body telling you to piss on your sleep schedule, because if you maintain this morning routine you are *definitely* getting up super early every day
i’ve been doing crosswords every morning for the past couple years and let me tell u, every time i finish one i feel like a BOSS. so i too am a brain games supporter
I like cold showers, but only in the middle of summer when its 30+ degrees.
6:28 STOP STARING AT ME LIKE THAT😭
hey Kurtis dream interpreter here. You pissing on the bed means you need to make extra content this month. hope this helps :)
That segue into the hellofresh ad… SO SMOOTH hahaha
Remember what they said don't bully people on what they can't change, but they have the money to literally change anything on them... so continue
Water, tea and smoothie billionaires must get more bathroom break than there employees.
I think your dreams mean you're tired of being on the road.
Oh nooooo Kurtis did you put the FROZEN blubs ????
Can you just tell us about your dreams every morning?
Um .. Can I put in a request or a video of Kurtis Conner and just make fun of all the rich white guys please and thanks
Kurtis as much as I love you as the mayor of our town, I would like you to be the prime minister of Canada. Pleaseeeeeee
what is this thomas the tank engine slander
People say that you shouldn’t comment on something that someone can’t fix in 5 seconds. If you have 202 billion dollars I think 5 seconds is generous
Hi! I actually am a dream analyst, and that dream of you pissing the bed in a hotel actually does have a deeper meaning! It means you wanna piss a bed at a hotel. Hope this helps :)
AHH YOU TALKED ABT PROBIOTICS N I HAD A PROBIOTIC AD RIGHT AFTER
Kurtis please don't do those breathing exercises, you're scaring me
Kurtis putting himself thru that smoothie ooooffff   Also I like his house
Omg that smoothie needs help! Throw in some yogurt, frozen mangos, and orange juice!! Water-based smoothies are horrid.
I liked the video but PLEASE do NOT eat a WORM. I beg of you!!
can a brain smoothie be your next Its Fuckin Cookin challenge plz
Dude not gonna lie, You look so much better after that week! You glowin bruh
better get to eating those worms Kurtis time stops for billionaires only, and you're not a billionaire
don't let capitalist propaganda cloud your mind, comrade. do only what you want in your life, don't be complacent and don't alienate yourself from other people. break the system, love yourself
You think your gonna get rid of your mullet in 2022?
Kurtis looks like your average white young father from 1993. I know he has a girlfriend but he can pull it off. Super cute. 😏 Mustache and mullet.
morning routines like this are impossible for anyone who has a full time job. There's no way for me to wake up early enough to do all of this before work
I liked the video, eat some worms
enjoying seeing more of kurtis' place 👀 bro's got style!! that shower?? and that journaling corner is making me re-think a vintage brass and smoky glass end table i passed up 🤔
can your next video be a bunch of just straight up roasts on the ultra elite? thank you 💜
very really good Kurtis! loved this video
you're literally not even american stfu lol how many billionaires does canada even have lnerd???
kurt
this is so bizarre but someone had to do it? comrade kurtis ftw
But I love this video. I was always a big fan of "increasing my productvitiy" throughout the day and would search around the internet for more tips. I wanted to like mix it all up and form the 'ultimate' routine for the day to 'build the best habits', but all it did was confuse me and tire me out. Eventually throughout the years I realized that I don't need to take advice from people I don't know and who don't even have the same circumstances as I do. Maybe it worked for them, but it didn't for me. And that's okay.  Like Kurtis said, morning or night routines should be a supplement to your /entire/ day and motivate you to do the things you need and want to do, so only YOU know what kind of routine would be perfect for yourself.  Really nice video!
Planning your emotions for the day is some real Brave New World shit
I’m so thankful you’re the mayor here 😌
Wow that’s crazy I had a dream that I was a doctor and was telling someone that they need to cut down on their worm consumption
How tf does this dudes bed head look better than his hair post shower
Q buen video
kiwi is such a star
Alpha breathing is 100% for lizard people
Nooooo I do a bunch of this shit :( so embarrassing
this video is nothing but pure gold
i do my omega breathing every morning
I've never understood spinach in smoothies
honestly you could make an entire video just roasting billionaires for hours and i'd watch it ten times a day
He doesn’t brush his teeth!!!!
I feel like the start if 2022 has been horrible for everyone      Am I wrong, i started off the year with Covid
Could have said Jeff Bozos. Unless he does idk I haven’t seen the whole video yet.
That breathing  segment  was fucking terrifying  tf
kurtis conner where is my extra greeting?
my friend was laughing so hard when you made the joke about mountain dew and cosmic brownies smoothies and she was eating clam chowder and threw on her bed from laughter. it. was. hilarous.
16:03 „ow hmg..wish i..i wish..i rather..y‘know“
i absolutley love that alll commentary youtubers upload the same day
I envy people who dream. Last time I had a dream was years ago. I miss the flying dreams the most :(
You could make that shower slightly warm, not super cold, that's ok for a start
why do all billionaires either talk like they're cyborgs or giving a ted talk
"and when you're a sigma you fcking die bc you are too strong for breathing" wheezed
4:35 i think that means you're eating too many fucking worms, kurtis.
💃💃💃
affirmations t-shirt 💖
I liked it.
Alpha breathing is the most insane thing I’ve ever seen
I would like to braid flowers into the mullet, just letting you know, I'm here if you're interested Kurt Boy
But you don’t have a billion dollars
the alpha breathing nearly gave me a panic attack
kurtis went through all five stages of grief after that single sip of a smoothie
you invented comedy
THE THING WITH THE DOCTOR AND THE WORM MADE ME CACKLE
Hey man don't make fun of my boy Jeff. (Jeff if you see this since I defended you we are now friends, can I have a billion dollars?)
I have OCPD and uh… the lists… might wanna look into that billionaire boi
I tried the alpha breathing and I ended up drooling on my dog. She hasn’t forgiven me yet. 5/10👍
The billionaire morning routine doesn’t include getting dressed or brushing your teeth or anything. Dang.
Kurtis kinda looks like my dad when my parents got married in 1991
Look into pranayama, if you want to learn breathing techniques, when I was doing pranayama regularly I noticed a definite effect on my well-being, my breathing is deeper and more efficient and effective, years after I started failing at keeping a regular schedule of pranayama.
Woot Poot
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
The most surprising thing about this video is that Kurtis has like really vivid dreams that he can recall until he wakes up. I literally don't think I dream anymore and I don't know what that means for my brain fhdsjgskgkss
i was like 'why does this only have 100k views and then I realised he uploaded this a few hours ago
HelloFresh is dumping thousands of dollars into union busting against it's employees.
Loved this video!
I want to have the same kinds of dreams as kurtis
When he said “I make my brain smoothie” I thought he meant make his brain smooth. Billionaire 101: make brain smooth-y
I never thought I’d see a white man get that close to a Jheri curl.
Turning on the Thomas the tank engine theme on full blast and thinking about every mistake you've ever made sounds like literal torture
This was one of my favorite videos you’ve done! I’m gonna take a boiling hot shower just for you 😂
I could listen to you body shaming billionaires for 39 minutes
i'm not gonna defend jeff bezos but body shaming is bad in part bc there's collateral damage, so even if the target is shitty it's really not cool bro
it's funny you talk about dream interpretation because I've been studying it a lot recently. without getting too complicate, your dream are complex. they simply mean - you're weird
Hey bunny :)
i want the cheddar 2 kurtis:,)
I watched Trial by Fire yesterday and throughout the movie, I kept thinking that Kurtis looked like the main actor. He doesn’t.
Woho
this video made me realize how hard it can be to be a billionaire. thank you for spreading awareness kurtis
Where is my extra greeting. PROMISES WERE MADE, KURTIS.
The commitment. The prestige. The drama of it all.
I think he is evolving into Dr Disrespect. 🤣
uwu let's watch Kurtis to sleep
dang ur alpha breath stinks
You are so funny I cant watch this rn. My parrents are asleep😭
I love videos like this where you try something new no matter how ridiculous. Your vid of you trying to be a country boy is still one of my favorites.
My to-feel list for the best evening: laugh my ass off on Kurtis Conner’s video ✅
He has to drink brain smoothies because he loses so many brain cells not breathing while recalling his dreams and making his bed.
4:48 omg isn't that the famous book the fault in our stars !
It amazes me how actual billionaires make these videos as if they actually do all of these things
What if someone who isn’t a billionaire has an eye like that 🥺
this makes me wish kurtis vlogged 😂😂
Kurtis got a fancy shower
I tried Kurtis's morning routine. The mountain dew cosmic brownie smoothie was so good and I felt so awake. So awake that I stayed up until 7:00 am. And then my dog woke me up at 7:30 am to pee and shit.
0/10 didn't play on cool math games
I like the frame of mind about 2022 being different as in even worse, cause it shouldn't be able to disappoint then, and if it does, that's kind of extreme
I almost choked on my orange juice because  of 9:12
I thought he was going to make his brain more smoothie  as in smoothening his brain
Kurtis I will venmo you money for a haircut please Kurtis, please
Hey Kurtis! I'm actually planning on moving to Canada by the end of this year, do you have any advice?
I watched this before I got out of bed, then I went and had a waffle and now I’m back on YouTube. Couldn’t be happier on my day off
I have a dream journal in my phone and it's so long that I had to start a second note lol but I like voice to texting them right when I wake up so I don't forget it and I can get it down fast.... But it's not because I think the dreams mean anything... It's just like a crazy brain dump of nonsense lol only reason I jot down my dreams is because *they're fucking crazy*
i have the same blender as kurtis conner???? idk how to process this information
"He's got overcast in his mouth" I'm crying
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
"They already made a cats movie? I should watch that!" No, no you shouldn't.
bro you're idea of there not being an equal number of black and white billionaires is wack. of course a minority group will have less, that's what minority means. there are less of them.
24:50
gonna watch it 2nd time on hasanabi's broadcast,if he does
Hates on south but rocks a mullet. Get a Canadian haircut yaa Custer
this man made the mullet look good. THIS MAN MADE THE MULLET LOOK GOOD.
24:30
Mark zuckerberg doesn't write in his "to feel" list... that's the reason why he is like that
It's so wild to me how people can just get up and do things in the morning. I watch tiktoks for at least 30 minutes to an hour while waiting for my meds to kick in. Although now I'm trying to cut back on my screen time and I am using that time to read instead so that is the ONLY part of the routine that I agree with.
The breathing killed me
I thought when he was making his brain smoothie he was going to say the most important ingredient was a brain 😅
ALWAYS hated the morning routine videos and articles, like even as someone who keeps their responsibilities mostly later during the day and likes having long ass mornings, i STILL don't have the time to read 17 books, meditate for 40 minutes, etc etc.   It's all stupid. Time is limited, you can only do a couple of things before you have to officially begin your day and start working on something, or go grocery shopping, or go see someone or whatever. You only have 24 hours in a day. And i say this as someone who works part time for 4 hours a day and studies as little as humanely possible for a passing grade. I can't even imagine doing much other than drinking coffee if i were to work 8 hours a day and god forbid also have kids for example. Like come on, not even actual billionaires are that liberal with their time, and they don't do shit ever
your handwriting lmaoo I’m sorry its just funny
why did i read the title as "i lived like a ballerina for a week"
radicalized
off topic but your house is really nicely decorated
SHEESH
i hate that he says "spinage" instead of spinach
Kurtis a comrade??
idk how to give feedback but this video make me audibly laugh 3 times in the first 5 minutes which is rare so good job i dont know how this will help
Once again i didn’t get my extra greeting. This is not the service I was promised so I will be permanently unsubscribing and filing an official complaint. My entire year has now been ruined, thanks.
Hello Fresh have had vicious anti-union policies and employees have been injured in their warehouses. Please stop supporting them until they commit to ending these practices and fixing their mistakes.
The ad transition got me good 😂 fantastic video
That house is *gorgeous*, amazing decor job, Jenna and Kurtis
Only billoneirs i like are kanye and kinda elon musk
Cold showers are actually awesome. They give you a rush of euphoria, and it’s really good for you. I use to take them, but I moved and the water doesn’t get cold enough
Hey. Actually bodyshaming hurts the people around you more than it ever will the people you're insulting. Now your viewers with teeth issues and asymmetrical faces will know that you think there is something wrong with them. That was really disappointing, dude.
why was that intro so loud omg
i need more of kurtis moving around content
this man talking about breathing like it’s demon slayer 💀💀
Damn bro how dare you diss sudoku like that that game fucking SLAPS
To comics count as reading.... I'm going to go ahead and assume _yes_
Conner in Rusia they rub cold snow on their body. A shower can't be that bad
Kurtis your house is fab, also this video was hilarious. Thank you.
his alpha breath stinks
I'm going to have Alpha breathing nightmares now, thanks Kurtis!
Kurtis you make the 80s style look hot.
eat the rich
I'm so happy i'm not the only one that finds the morning success videos to be BS
a danny AND kurtis upload?
You forgot that he puts EVERYTHING in his brain smoothie. I don't even remember being in there.
Claim your within a day award right here here are the rewards here within 2 days award: 🥈 here within 1 day award: 🥇 here within 3 days award: 🥉
But yeah ease your way into meditation.  For me I’m so anxious. And I fall asleep too. But you got this, Kurt!
Whoa… I’ve never been this early to a Kurtis upload before. That was totally my New Years resolution! 😬
Eat the rich
This is the morning routine of those guys on Succession
Dang. Your alpha breath stinks.
Wow I hate rich people LOL
this morning routine is legit like 6 hours long
Me who has a biggier left eye😿
2:58 we talking statistics now?
15:47 yo that t-shirt you have is sick man
So I don't do meditation or yoga or any of that stuff but I have a lot of friends that do... And I was actually gifted this device that you put on your head. It's called Muse. And then you download the app for it and you put headphones in and you get to do this cool meditation thing. I thought it was kind of silly at first. But actually enjoyed it. It'll be a rainstorm and you have to concentrate on relaxing and as you relax more the rainstorm lets up and if you really relax you'll hear songbirds. It felt like I achieved something when I got the birds. And it was actually pretty relaxing just closing my eyes and laying down. I looked up how expensive the thing is and it can be a hundred or a couple hundred bucks for it though. 😬 Not something I would have actually purchased myself but as a gift it's pretty fucking cool. ✌️
Cold showers depend where you live if you live in a hot area it’s fine but if you’re at a cold area like Canada (cough cough) you would like a warm shower
Here before 100k lmao
I already take cold showers. You get used to it after awhile. It’s nice.
P.s the spider man one in my eyes are you think your holding yourself back having to much fun. And your gonna be Spiderman.
i got hello fresh with your last discount and oh my god my life is changed
*I'm a little cuck*
18:40 why did you drink that? 😭
I’m literally procrastinating setting some (sane) habits by watching this… 🥳
great billionaire rant enjoying the communism
Lol my therapist told me to do those breathing exercises when I’m having a panic attack and oh boy do they make it worse lmao. But at least I’m uncomfortable about my breathing and not the other things I was worried about
the fucking breathing took me out LMFAOAOAOOAOAOAOOOOOOO
Dream interpreter here✋ Your dream means that there is someone coming for you. He is big and hairy and his name is Gooby and he will find you very soon so be aware. He knows everything.
i was pissing myself at the breathing part
is it just me or in the first bit of the video are the whites of his eyes blue-ish
"we're not Human Doings, we're Human Beings" Omw to become a Human Feeling
This guy must piss like 50 times a day
An Ally Hills AND Kurtis Conner upload in one day! My bi heart is happy.
Love the darkviperau reference here 11:39
The morning routine doesn't include brushing teeth or deodorant? Stinky boi
thank u for feeding us this good food kurt boi
cold showers are honestly not that bad😭 it’s better to start with warm water and then work ur way up to cold but 1) no one has time for that lmao and 2) you live in Canada
good mOrning.
kurtis doing alpha breathing kinda looks like willem dafoes green goblin
I love how Kurtis took just the ingredients the guy listed and used those. I took it as he usually has blueberries, avocado and spinach in his smoothies because those are good for you but that you can also add other things to make it taste good. But I guess I didn't see the whole video. Haha
kurtis body shaming rich old guys while wearing a "please be nice" shirt is so funny what
omg the 2 min movement clips have me dead
Okay but 26:29 is what I do every single morning. How did you fucking know that!?!?!?
is it me or kurtis has gotten insane i mean i like it its funny asf but i think being a billionaire doesn't do good for u dnjcsjksoxnsoa
Watching this it feels like rich people think "why are poor people poor? Because they don't make to do lists"
me (an empath) thinking kurtis' piss dream signifies being a sigma male
That ugly mustache really brings attention to your beautiful teeth and alright smile.
9:05
FYI lots of people put that mushroom shit in their coffee. You can even buy coffee with that stuff already in it
I think the worm dream was you letting in and accepting negative energies in your life and the doctor getting mad at you was ur loved ones wanting you to stop so you can be happy but objectively,,,hilarious
The main thing I got from this is that I really want kurtis to review the Cats movie
immediately laughed just reading the title in my sub feed
The mindful breathing thing can be really helpful to the parasympathetic nervous system to help turn off the fight or flight instinct and reduce cortisol levels, so it is actually really helpful. But do 2 for 1 and incorporate box breathing or another technique into mediation practice (most guided meditations actually include a breathing technique, they just don't spell it out).
this video is funny asf
meditation is thinking time! time to reflect on tuff, on yourself and stuff like that, while creating a calm and relaxing environment for urself to do so
i love u
He drinks a full cup of water, an herbal tea, and a large smoothie all before leaving the house??
I’m very convinced that people who take cold showers hate themselves
I really like breathing exercises.  I'm no billionaire or anything though.
I just sleep on top of my bed so it’s always made and now I’m a trillionaire think smarter, not harder
did you ever/could you do a plant tour !!!! i would love
2022 is the sequel to 2020? huh
mm gotta go get Tony Hawk's pro skater 2
"Yes I'm body shaming... What are you gonna do"
Yes
Morning poutine
the amount of joy i feel when i see that you’ve uploaded…i cant even explain what it does to me
Kurtis: body shaming Me: 👁️👄👁️👀😱 Kurtis: what? You're going to stand up for Jeff Bezos?  Me: umm, nooo...
Nowhere in the morning routine tutorial was breakfast included. 👁👁
“I’m gonna be a BILLIONAIRE. with a BEE”
The *hustle grindset* is the opiate of the masses
oh my god kurtis’ version of the morning routine at the end made me laugh harder than i have in years
lmao. I'm only four and a half minutes in, and I've already got a problem: not everyone has "normal" dreams. Some of us insane fuckers have _crazy_ vivid dreams every goddamn night that make next to 0 sense (and don't even get me started on time dilation in my dreams, holy shit), and even _trying_ to process them can cause hours of general dysphoria and anxiety. If I want to be productive, I _specifically_ need to get that shit out of my thoughts as quickly as possible. Hell, even the dreams I experience that _do_ have a congruent storyline can fuck me up for _days_ (or more) if I try to process them.
I could easily watch another 30 minutes of Kurtis just roasting the hell out of billionaires
You’re doctor is gon b mad when u eat all them worms
Catch drake pouring his hot sauce smoothies into his condoms
O
Absolutely loving this Kurtis Conner storyline. Reminder to unionize your workplace!
I'm actually not mad at the things on this list. Cold water's good for your skin, meditative breathing can help with focus. However, who the fuck makes a smoothie with just plain WATER?
Of course it's not gonna work, not with that socialist mindset! You gotta want to have unpaid children working for you in the Philippines
Smoothie tip: When creating a smoothie with spinach, always put the spinach in first and use an equivalent amount of water to ensure the spinach is properly blended. Once all the green leafy bits look like The Ooze from Ninja Turtles, it's safe to add other ingredients. :)
I wish the whole video *was* you roasting old white dudes
I feel that Kurtis, Drew, and Danny come as a package they all got the same energy
Yo I’m Ontario too
Woah kurtis went to Harvard
yeah theyre either lying about doing it all or lying about the first step actually being "snort adderall"
The pissing the bed dream is about letting your inner child out. It being in a hotel means you don't feel safe to do so in your own space. /j
Kurtis you look gorgeous! Gorgeous gorgeous bois have pretty hair and hate cold showers👯‍♀️
Genuinely the most I've laughed at a youtube video in a while. Keep it up Kurt boy 🤙🏻
i had a dream the other night that dr otcto octaveious stole my motorcycle i dont think its that meaning full
Hey Kurtis, the breathing bit? Don’t do it again. True horror.
Anyone else notice the subtle messaging that being a billionaire = being smart with all the stuff about brain supplements and what not?   Like obviously to be a billionaire you can’t be a bag of rocks but smarts don’t guarantee riches, I’d say far from it...
That one loose ringlet coming down over his shoulder is everything ✨
dang ur alpha breathe stinks
Yeah so I always take cold shower and there is no reason why but they are superior then hot shower
tbh he’s just acting like this isn’t how he already lives.  we all know kurtis is equal to jeff bezos in overall networth
please make more videos like this! my favorite videos that you've made are always the ones where u like do some project like the video where u became a magician, the ai video, that golf game u got a world record in, becoming a country boy, living like wewearecute etc.
we finally have a billionaire as the mayor of kurtis town
That human doings quote made me scream
Just did Kurtis's routine, I can confirm that I am now a billionaire
I like to make my bed. Because where I live, there are scorpions and it’s good to fluff out your bed to check for them 🙃.
I LOVED THIS VIDEO KURTIS!!! you are the best! saludos desde México
What if Kurtis dreams in reverse so while he was dreaming of pissing on a bed he was actually using the bathroom properly
Your handwriting is exactly as I’d expect
This was the best vidoe kurtis made
kurtis has teeth?
The video end morning routine had me fucking crying pls I'm ryienmalfjkkjdb
our leftist king
how to be a billionaire:  1. be born into a rich white family 2. be lucky    that's it. that's fuckin it 👍🏽
Okay but I want this dudes shower.
im tempted to send this to my business teacher whos obsessed with jim kwik
I love this video so much
This is such a good video ahah, loved it!
24:09 that would be a great cut to a sponsorship for Audible
I like to lose in the morning because then if I lose again during the day it’s like well it wouldn’t be the first time
im not a person who laughs a lot, like i can think something is funny and still not laugh, but this is probably the funniest video ive like.. ever seen. i laughed so hard i fell off my chair and my mom got  mad at me for waking my brother up cause i was laughing so mf loud
your rich person shower tho
kurtis your moustache looks AMAZING
I hate my dreams. They remind me of better lives I could be living. Or to fantastic to be real.
Is this guy a fucking socialist
I'm gonna do kurbussys morning routine evey day and record the results here in the comments section, and see how fast I deteriorate from the man I am, to the cuck of a man I'd like to be 😌
Find someone who looks at you like Kurtis looks at his brain smoothie.
Okay but can we get the whole video of Kurtis just dunking on billionaires please?
Of all the shirts in the world, this is the one I share with Kurtis. Walmart gold.
Kurtis, every video slaps, you genuinely a comedian. But you gotta cut the hair
The sound effects make me feel like I'm watching PeeWee's Playhouse.
i love when kurtis goes full anti capitalist — it is always a treat. great video king ❤️
Why wouldn't your dreams be like that? Everyones dreams are like that. Sure being a reductionist is fun but i think you do you, and everyone stupid enough to hang on your every word, a disservice by chopping every thing he says down
why does it matter if the are white or black billionaire?  lost me there bud
Kurtis, they had never told you to get dressed or brush your teeth. I assume you had done both of those things (hence the being dressed). I suggest you remake the whole video but CORRECTLY this time.
The phrase "Bingo hall of Fame" is fantastic.
The guy in the video’s voice sounds like Ryan 💀
The only mullet I actually tolerate:
Kurt goin socialist mode in the intro hell yea
i actually do keep track of my dreams when i remember them just cuz i have really weird ones.
100% Mark the Basic Avatar Zuckerburg makes a to feel list. Got to convince the humans that i am human.   Kurtistown forever
The bit with the Thomas the Tank Engine song KILLED ME. 💀💀💀 I really needed that laugh today.
Anti capitalist Kurtis is my favorite Kurtis lol
Well I assume it's the caffeine in the coffee that you're addicted to, and to that I say,  get high strength calm teas, the caffeine level should suffice you addict boy!
The clip with Cedric Diggory's dad killed me
i only body shame billionaires and racists. oh, and cops, but the racist part pretty much covers that lol
My dreams are always a literal conglomerate of things I’ve seen the day before. Wouldn’t be surprised if I dreamed of Kurtis as my breakfast eggs.
4:13 Me processing my plans to witness a city being crushed by a giant exploding laptop, as I escape across a large backgammon board, and my family members slowly morph into Cosmo and Wanda from Fairly Odd Parents:
Your dreams seem mostly to be about you in stressful situations, or doing something you'll get in trouble for. So I diagnosis you with ✨ANXIETY✨
You should be happy with your success 3.5M subs. You're not any less happy than they are. Money means nothing. Motive means something.
yo that shower is 100% FUCKING GOALS OMG I WANT IT
I actually do that breathing exercise for my voice training because it stretches the vocal cords. My teacher just calls it the "creepy little kid smile"
Wow- this is the earliest I’ve ever been for a kurtis video- yes
"next i did a quick climb of mount everest as a start for my day"
Did I hear “Spinage”? lol  PS love this guy. And Kurtistown ❤️
kurtis. did you use a clip of the goosebumps episode where the dad is a plant eating plant food. pls respond
Comrade Conner is becoming more based than ever.
I’m just dying at the fact that while Kurtis is bullying these billionaires, the only part of his shirt you can see is: “Please Be Nice”
what's the link to the puzzle game?
Comrade Kurt
"I make time for the things that are most important - I read" Me: *reads das kapital to learn why this mf is so weird*
Over this past year, kurbussys transformation from a softboy/eboy to a mullet mustache rocking badass is one for the ages bro. 😎  we love it g don't ever start being a weird softboy again I'm just happy I didn't know you during the vine days, I see pics of you smiling way too big and wearing the most hipster clothes and hats ever, ya kno, I hate it. I kno there a reason I didn't hop on the kurbussy trolley until more recently & this last year inparticular has been great to you as a creator, can I get a few poggers in the chat for agreeance ? Hecks yea dawg, stay tf up !
im not used to kurtis doing routine things, hes so cute the little things he gets annoyed at hehe
Everyone, subscribe to make Kurtis a billionaire!
🐛
13:57 bruh how did i know he was gonna fart before he even leaned over lol
His stutter after trying his tea killed me
So who's making a video doing Kurtis's routine for a week?
Woah Curtis didn't need to flex on us with the fancy showerhead, kinda gives away that you're already a billionaire but go off I guess
L to the OG this is my routine
Why did you add so little water to the smoothie
cold showers are just a form of self harm
"holy sh*t you still haven't taken a breath yet dude?"
I think the amount of trash that comes from one of those hello fresh boxes plus the gas emissions it takes to get to you far out way the negative effects of throwing away food scraps which could just be composted anyway
LIONS MANE???????? IN A TEA?????? WHAT?????
You have 50 teeth
Your dreams tell me it’s a kurtis thing…                                                         I wouldn’t understand
Dang your alpha breath stinks
unrelated but you have a nice apartment 🤗
dang ur alpha breath stinks kurtis 😡😡😡
i can't get over how much the billionaire sounds like Dave from those Gayle videos by chris flemming.
where is the logan roy morning routine
Tbh i feel like i should make some of those into my morning routine, at least try it out. Cuz rn my morning routine is waking up, checking time, waking up paniced if its late or lay for another hour watching youtube, drink some coffee and get my meds.  But recalling dreams, making my bed, drinking water before anything else and checking my to-do list for a day (that i would write in previous days so i know i dont forget shit) seems like a decent advice to be more on my grind.  Yall laughing at analyzing dreams and yea there is a lot of dreams that dont make much sense, but they can actually change a way you are thinking about certain things. I'd give examples but that would take forever and some of my personal life stuff which i dont wanna share.
Mountain dew and cosmic brownie smoothie
COMRADE KURTIS
The real billionaire morning routine: - look at phone to see how stocks are doing - go back to sleep
Someone please make a video following Kurtis's suggested morning routine for a week. Please, Please, PLEASE!!
Everyone tried the Alpha breathing i know it. We're all Alpha's now!
no wonder you're not a billionaire yet with all that breathing before your glass of water
I speak a lot of languages  播音又不二忐忑人你呕吐不二提案来看阿伯阿伯ut    么  ようはヴぇ野lーぃふぇ Toi bébé ni lire and toi depuis vive.
Dang your alpha breath stinks
Everyone gets off on hating Bezos. We need to share that hatred with Musk. He's god aweful.
KURTIS STOP! you're eating too many worms
I really enjoyed this man, you’re one of the most hilarious people on the world wide web 👏👏👏 Thank you 💕
so inspiring 🐩
my left eye is bigger than my right... but considering you only just noticed this about bezos maybe its fine lol
a quick cold change in temperature like cold showers, can actually be extremely good for your immune system, its one of the reasons wintebathing is a thing
when i take cold showers sometimes n get an apple at panera BUT IM STILL BROKE???
your mustache is amazing don't shave it until it looks like the guy from Ninjago pls old pls
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The hair is gorgeous, never cut it
Where’s the guillotine emoji
I didn't know I needed this but it was beautiful and I just want to say thank you.
Jeez Kurtis be careful with pissing dreams!
I work from home so my morning routine is literally roll out of bed, walk to computer, go to work lmao
Miss opportunity to pick up the classic Brain Training for the Nintendo DS.
“TODAY YOU FEEL NOTHING” yes sir
the guy narrating the billionaire morning routine video sounds like kurtis lol
The way he looks absolutely HEARTBROKEN when he drinks the brain smoothie for the first time.
This comment has 1k likes.
This was such a banger of a video my guy
idk why but I love Elon musk
Just binging YouTube since Danny, Jacob, and Kurtis all posted on the same day :)
To be honest, I think I know someone who does the Anti-billionaire morning routine you described.
Jeff Bezos eye is tiny because that’s where he hides his secrets
if anyone genuinely wants to do some “brain training” i suggest doing a daily puzzle on wordle.  you have to guess a 5 letter word in 6 tries.  the right letters in the right places will appear green. the right litters in the wrong places will appear yellow. the wrong ones will appear dark gray. and you navigate with that. honestly, it’s kinda fun
when it comes to dream interpreting, it's more of a personal thing, it takes a meaning based on your own experiences. But there are certain cultural symbols that are mostly common to our culture. In the secon dream you mentioned willingly pissing in a bed, a bed is seen as a safe space, where you hide from monsters as a child, a cradle of sorts, you willingly pissed on it, that's a bit deviant, you were fully aware of your actions, pissing on something willingly is evil. Now, what changes the setting is the fact that that was not your bed, but a Hotel's, if i had more info on how you were feeling, how was the hotel and why you pissed on the bed i could do a bit more of an in depth analysis.  That being said, ruining something that brings comfort to other people seems to be the point of that dream, my uneducated guess would be that you were thinking of the video you were making, "raining" on that dude's parade, taking whoever made the billionaire routine video out of his comfort zone. Now, this could be about any other part of your life that me, as a viewer and long time subscriber am not aware of.  Also i know for certain you pissed your bed.
You really went and matched your shirt colours to your smoothie ingredients. Hardcore sigma billionaire moves
I’m so gonna do kurtis’ morning routine
shoutout to pc frozen berries
Frick you Kurtis! I have a lazy eye and how DARE you make me aware that I share a trait with Jeff Bezos…truly sickening
Ah yes, my favorite berry: avocados
actually, recalling your dreams daily and journaling them can help with lucid dreaming. it’s a good practice specially for that
“...alpha breathing...” Me: Aight, imma head out.... ✌🏻🖕🏻🤣
"I have a list about lists I wanna write about lists because lists."  ~This Guy~
Probiotics are all pissed out. A billionaire sold you on that one...   You'd be better eating worms like a real billionaire.  #GoEatWorms
"They work hard play hard" they keep partying like it's their job
Maybe the reason Billionaires can exploit the working class is because they are always so mad from taking cold showers.
my dreams aren’t “fixing things” i dream about garfield
I was naping before i watched this video. During that nap I had a dream that I was fighting a reindeer. What does that mean billionares???? Huh? HUH???
I'm not standing up for jeff bezos (fuck that guy) but for myself cause I have one eye thats bigger than the other😭
TIL billionaires don’t change clothes, brush their teeth/hair, or wash their face in the morning
“brain smoothie” they are zombies for sure
@27:21 song sounds familiar but can't remember the name!!!
As someone who lives in sd, the summers get incredibly hot, so cold showers are nice
I opened this video thinking "oh shit, they also took Kurtis with this morning routine". Then started the video and I love it so much 😨😨 am I becoming a billionaire too?
So his comment about their “only being seven billionaires” clearly trying to say that’s racist, think again about the fact that their is seven on there, clearly they can make the money too maybe they just haven’t? Like how many Mexicans or Asians are on there? Why is it always just about pitying a group of people who need no pity and shouldn’t even want pity
Smooth ad transition 😎👍
As a regular hater of body shaming that left eye like KILLED ME. Also fuck billionaires
alpha breathing gave me an asthma attack
you share a bed with jenna? what the heck dude, you're not even married
Also, the smile guy is basically the billionaire from don't look up.
I write down my dreams every morning. If you have short term memory problems, it’s good for you.
It means you pissed in bed fool
country tobey maguire
How do we know how to achieve yogurt breathing???
Imagine living in a reality where you wake up each morning and write down what you want to be for the day. "Today I'm going to be cunt because I'm a humanBEING"
Did kurtis buy a blender just for this video ? Also nice mullet
Box breathing is how you get square balloons.
Omg kurpiss
i think this video was somehow funnier than usual
Cold showers are aight but only for a half a second after you've washed your hair.
I just got fired from my overworked underpaid target job so I really relate to this title sound very relevant for me😅😅😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I knew the "brain" thing was branding and marketing ... I can smell a cash grab bad ad from literally 1364ft away downwind, upwind ? Boy im smelling it from miles away easy.
I mean writing down your dreams is just nice to do because you get to write down weird shit and look back on it from time to time, I wouldn't call it pointless.
This is the best video you have made yet thank you!
Drinking that smoothie, the look on his face was like he was drinking sadness and disappointment.
can we make the "got it so thick" a tiktok audio pleeaase
#ColdShowersSuckGang
Im literally begging farting and shitting for more kiwi content
Cold showers are for people who don’t live in Canada, even a hot shower ends with you being cold when you step out. Also clearly they’re wrong- I’ve  been very cold after a shower and all it does is make me miserable
If you're not gonna make your bed first thing in the morning, then why even bother with this routine and video! You're obviously not gonna become a billionaire if you're not doing that first! /s
i thought billionares had enough money to do nothing, oh wait, there too ALPHA FOR RELAXATION
kurtis come to brazil ill pay you 20 bucks
I love this video
i also do 20 minutes of medication every morning :)
That green goblin jumpscare sound though
Kurtis says he wants to ride Jeff bezos like a snowboard but not to upstage him or anything but im going to tre flip Elon musk
did you get on epstein’s jet?
#kurtisconner
his face when drinking the smoothie😭😭😭 also danny AND kurtis posting on one day? whats next? drew posting?
Frigg this video hits so hard plz share, and I'm only 2:55 in
There are 3.5 million residents of Kurtistown- if we all give just $57,000 our mayor can be as rich as Jeff Bezos!
DUDE SAID "INTERCREATING"
This guy actually blows. Like holy moly
they are 1 percent of the one percent
15:39 u mean in the kurtis corner?
I had a dream where i played black ops 1 with jonah hill. still my fav dream to this day
16:04 somehow i did know
9:11 I wish I could make an ITYSL reference but I can’t think
Thank you so much for criticizing billionaires! Finally someone on YouTube who has the bollocks to say it.
no, you don't have to watch cats kurtis
Were not human doings were human beings is the most outta touch cringy thing i ever heard then he said brain smoothie
I take my supplements every morning so why aren't I making at least 100$ per day! Also I almost died laughing at kurtis's opposite billionaire morning routine 😂
Great video, king!
spinadge
It's ab drive. It's ab power. mans stays humble,  mans DEVOURS
4:20 oooooh so that's why I always dream about stealing stores and cars like GTA. That make sense
it's the best you felt in a week because you're addicted to caffeine
t
I ALMOST CHOKED ON MY FOOD AT THE BREATHING
Just talk to your crush, what's the worst that could happen?  Me talking to my crush: 16:02-16:05
10:42 unexpected office
the point where kurtis just gave up at talking at 16.01 was the best thing ive ever seen and idk why
Really just had quite the apple pie bruv. I'm w this shit, to dA DAY
This dude says he’s NOT a human doing? Loser.
kurtis if you do a part two of this where you do it for like a month, for the brain games you should use the humanbenchmark test
can we mention how he said nsync
My morning routine is to immediately have a nap because I'm unemployed and depressed.
A morning routine that long looks like some shit for people who don't have real jobs. No wonder it's for billionaires.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
kurtis two days ago i dreamt that your name was john and that is very important to me
I love the aesthetic of your bedroom! Does anyone know where the bed frame is from?
Bodyshame a billionaire, new band name. Called it.
“Overcast in his mouth”
the first dream means you will have to eat a cow if you don't then you will die!   The second dream means you'll be a great farmer.
Ayy cold showers are the shit man
People who use breathe work for anxiety ptsd or depression which helps them in seconds are being discouraged even more cuz it’s WEIRRRDDDD CRINGEEE thanks but it’s the most helpful technique that meditation and yoga and writing shit down won’t give u
Way shocked that there’s 700+ billionaires in America??!? Wtf
The fact these people think their weird 4 hour long ”morning routines” would work for anyone who works 8-16 hour days, these people do not live in the real world with us, they don't and I will never understand regular people who are billionaire bootlickers at all.
These morning routines are so extensive they're done by the time it's noon
I’m going to alpha breath for the rest of time now. I will be irresistible. Men and women will flock to me. Non binaries will fall at my feet. I will be god
It's pretty telling that the billionaire morning routine involves time for exercise, brewing tea and making a fresh smoothie, and (at least arguably) emotional and mental self-care like meditation and journaling. They're the only people who have time for that shit on a weekday morning.  Also, re: the smoothie, I wonder if plain yogurt or something wouldn't have been better than the avocado (or in addition to an avocado), since I think the avocado basically does what bananas do while being less sugary (it adds creaminess and potassium). In any case, since blueberries have a pretty mild taste, I definitely think adding more tangy/acidic fruit (or even just more types of berries, like raspberries) could have helped with the flavor. Or adding some [organic] fruit juice, like Kurtis said. Tbh I would just suggest drinking a smoothie made out of ingredients you like, though.
Okay, but try this: start the shower warm and then slowly adjust the temp to cold. Less shocking, but still bracing! :) I don't do it regularly, but it can be nice sometimes.
I just pooped and lost a pound
Kurtis alpha breathing is the scariest thing ever  I got a new Lock Screen though
i absolutely love how passive aggressive this is
to-feel list skit is the hardest i've ever laughed
With the mustache and curly hair Kurtis is giving me big Frank Zappa vibes-
16:03 so true and relatable
When your sick but kurtis posts and it makes your whole day 😁
Lmao I have that exact brand of blueberries in my freezer Canada be like
Mullet fillet effect
6:36 🤳 "Mom, can you pick me up? I'm scared..."
Hey Kurti Birdie , love the energy but your voice sounds like the definition of sarcasm.
Kurtis, this is your doctor. That wasn't a dream. You're suffering from worm-induced psychosis from the sheer amount of worms you eat daily. This has to stop. Please get treated.
I love that you look just like some of the guys who are on Canadian Cops from the early 90s, and that’s a compliment
At least our boy rob is letting us eat on patios
Me, excitedly reentering the gates of Kurtis Town because the mayor uploaded again
is it just me or does he say "Churonto"
YES KURT BOY! LOVED THE VID!
yalls home decor is so good. Jenna popped off
Ohhhh so you and Dan Dan & Trahan posted at the same time to bless our youtube feeds ? Where's cody ko & m a ube when the good boy?? And maybe even racistpie, I mean Felix pie fckin autocorrect smfh
the mullet is too mullety, plz shorten it 🥺🤫
Egg
Also kiwi is the cutest god damn thing
i feel like you just described justin biebers daily life
I was really hoping that we misread the Mayan calendar and instead of 2012 it was 2021 but I guess it's gonna be 2120
pssst.....kurtis....hello fresh is anti union......psssssst
is it just me or the camera quality SLAPS for this vid
I love this Kurtis!
So, about the dreams bit, people usually think they are more random than they actually are. Read C.G. Jung, man was a schizoid but had a very interesting view on the meaning of dreams and how they relate to your mind (you just have to leave out the premonition dreams hypothesis, that shit was his dementia kicking in, pretty sure)
Cedrics death scene?? Thats low..
kurtis is in his commie era
I like your videos like this and the AI one the best!
the last time i tried to make myself better i got an eating disorder so honestly this year can only get better
1:53 That’s his right eye ball!!
kurtis you had no reason to make the breathing section so scary wtf
Writing things down help with subconsciously imprinting them in ur mind so if your DEPRESSED and need to change ur subconscious mind to write positive affirmations down and through the medium of feeling and action they become CONSCIOUS and u actually act on what u imprinted into your subconscious!! god I was trying to just observe and not react but fuck it I attached the truth and reacted idc🤣USE UR BRAINNNN BOOO🍅🍅🍅🍅
Kurtis I would just like to let you know that when you said "kay fuck sudoku" I was indeed doing a sudoku puzzle
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The only thing left today…. Is for drew to upload and complete the trifecta
god rich people suck
Okay but that breathing segment was so uncomfortable both physically and in the video
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Say this 10x fast:  “Kurtis Conner is a Canadian Comedian”
white billionaires? guillotine black billionaires??? SLAAAY QUEEEEEN
I just wanted to say I got a live action merge mansion ad before the video
Bro the skeleton t-shirt is really cool
Here within an hour 🤪
Kckdp
Kurtis you can't just drink coffee, it has to be brain coffee.
we all know a billionaire couldn’t have a GLORIOUS moustache like you Kurtis
Eyo Kurtis, instead of doing a whole cold shower, try taking your regular shower but then before you shut the water off, put just your head under the shower and turn it to cold (even room temp tbh). It feels refreshing and I think it makes my hair healthier and easier to dry.
Lol I got excited when CKY came on lol
Kurtis you’re first dream means you have no way home….. you are Spider-Man no way home😦
Based anti-capitalist Burtis Bonner
You could could just make a whole video making fun of Warren buffets diet
Bro I liked how Kurtis starts the video with a pessimist prediction for this year
WAIT! i thought 2021 was the sequel of 2020..  But were only now in the sequel???!!!  T_T  *sad*
the alpha breathing killed me
That “today you feel nothing” is my gonna be my new wake up alarm for personal reasons
I have always had a problem with chronic headaches and other pains. After watching this, I made brain tea and after 10 minutes of drinking it, I was cured. This changed my life.
Great video!
Booo🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Breathe work helps with anxiety ptsd and depression in seconds meditation yoga and that shit will not help u but breathing a certain way can help u in seconds that alpha bullshit is so dumb corrupting the ways of helpful techniques thru media and ALPHA BULLSHIT🤣
“Hot take on cold showers” actually Kurtis I think it’s a pretty cold one
so this routine is useless as we knew/expected  🙄😒
”You're allowed to body shame a billionaire”- Kurtis Conner 2022
I would die for kiwi
dang ur alpha breath stinks 👀
i thought he said ALPHA BREEDING i was like hell ye go do yuor alpha breeding
Kurtis slowly evolving to look more yee-yee as the months pass is truly the highlight of my life
Lmao TODAY YOU FEEL NOTHING😂😂😂 classy disney.
Not to brag or anything but my cat has the same name as Kurtis Connor's dog 💅
I woke up from a bomb nap to u and Danny, 5 star review
In the morning hot showers put me back to sleep so I take cold showers because it wakes me up
These fuckin videos Kurtis is showcasing- all I can think of it Patrick Bateman 🤣
Your hair looks awesome king
Such a funny video, obsessed.
Sitting in my bedroom, home from work with covid, I feel like the exact opposite of this billionaire mindset — all the way down to the breathing aspect because yeah, I'm struggling to take a breath.... 😬
hello kurtis. i have a personal issue with this video. while watching it my computer died and then wouldn't turn on again for 10 minutes because it was updating, then when trying to log back in to finish your video my pasta fell on my bare mattress and then off my piece of bread onto my blanket. so i'm choosing to hate this video forever. this is your fault kurtis.
aight, you writing down Horny! three times on the To Feel list, that whole shot - it broke me
I wake up in my bed and decide to get up and get a glass of water. I walk to the kitchen to find you standing in the corner alpha breathing. I turn around hoping you were just a hallucination only to turn around and see you a few inches closer. I open the fridge and grab the water, when I close it I stand up and I can hear the breathing right behind me. BOOM. I’m gone. Don’t look away. DON’T BREATHE. He will kill you.
I saw the thumbnail and said “ohhhh nooooooo….” and then excitedly clicked on it thanks for the vid kurty
Forget the cold shower, the real crime here is that _brain smoothie!_ First off, who tf puts water in a smoothie?? Use milk or a plant based substitute or something, you psycho!   Also, you have to get some fat or else the vitamins won’t have anything to bind with. Put some coconut oil in there, ya dingus.   This billionaire guy wants to sound all cool and sophisticated, but 2/3 of what he says is just utter bs 💩
I love the look. You look like a cool but wholesome 80’s lad
Guys, i tried out kurtis morning routine and its the best thing ever!! I feel amazing!!
Dreams are subconscious ….what u thought it was from the dream fairy or sum  *Eating worms symbolizes fatigue and burnout* This could be a warning to slow down and focus on your health loool metaphysical meanings of animals insects and actions in dreams have been around in cultures and many people decipher them thru that but it’s all symbolic not real just a little explanation take it with a grain of salt
4:30 i had a dream the other night that i was playing fortnite but i was in the game and i was jesse pinkman from breaking bad. thats billionaire shit tbh.
dang ur alpha breath stink
I think it's funny that the second step (making the bed) implies that you're single. only single people are billionaires. or want to be billionaires
the narrator of the video sounds like a bootleg Ryan Reynolds
Why is this Jim Kwik hack not a billionaire if he has these secrets???
There was no extra greeting.  There's no reason to subscribe to this channel now.
Imagine the "brain training" part is secretly referring to sitting down with an Nintendo DS and playing Dr. Kawashima's Brain Age, that'd be quite funny
İt's midnight in my country and lemme tell you, that alpha breathing WİLL give me nightmares lmao
6:10 I’m literally dying at this bit
i thought you were making a video on nfts kurtis. what was that document actually about.
i actually do the cold shower thing! It helps me with breath control and managing panic attacks :)
Thanks enjoyed 😁
why did this inspire me to be productive wtf ok gonna go do my schoolwork ugh gross literally what even
Damn you didnt pay taxes and sat through insider trading meetings for a whole week? Respect man.
YesS
I just love how relentlessly patronising some of the billionaire lifestyle tips are, like old mate there trying to reinvent "breathing air out your mouth" as if that's a big technical hurdle thats holding most people back from incredible wealth - "I was living in the gutter and brushing my teeth with old rats, but now that i know to put my tongue behind my teeth when im breathing, I've become the CEO of a major international banking/law/taco bell firm and i now earn 6 figures a second working from my home which is Hogwarts castle. Thanks, old guy with a lot of money!"
5:57 this caught me so off guard that i started choking on my water
bestieeeeeeee
heard ‘it’s breathing time’ as ‘it’s breeding time’ idk about you but i prefer the latter
seems like the "billionaire morning routine" is more to try and convince themselves that they're still people, like the rest of us... technically
BODYSHAME!BODYSHAME!BODYSHAME!
Loved this episode, Kurtis ^^
Alpha breathing guy: this will help you relax Kurtis: *intense breathing noises while half dying* I RELAXED
Ohhh this one was a great video
i never noticed you have blue eyes until today. sick dude 🤙
dang ur alpha breath stinks
WHY DOES HE WRITE HIS “P”S LIKE THAT
agdjshdjshdh kurtis stressed me out with how little water he put in that “smoothie”😭
''work hard, play hard and look out for the little guy''  is probably the funniest thing ever
I'm wearing earphones and the horny to feel list bit almost gave me a heart attack then I laughed until I couldn't breathe   What a way to go that could've been
Good heavens, i am in the fairly early citizens commitee 🤔
Hey Kurtis, I am a Ph.D. Psychiatrist and that dream you had could mean one of two things. Either you have a deeply hidden trauma relating to your parents mistreating as a child or you really wanna take a piss in a hotel bed.
Amazing video Kurtis!
Bro... a lot of that stuff is healthy habits that anyone can do. Breathing exercise takes like 5 minutes. You can mediate for less than 20 minutes easily. Writing down your intentions for the day. All of these are healthy. It's cringe to watch you try to clap on healthy habits my dude.
I would totally watch a video of Kurtis making fun of the billionaires. About recalling dreams, I used to write mine down so that I could tell them to people
"your dreams is just your subconscious fixing things"  i remember when i was like 8 or so i had a dream that i was crawling up my grandma's stairs and looked in the bedroom and my grandma's cat was massaging my dad's back. uhm.
their house is so cool jenna did a great job
he better mention sweet baby rays
kurtis do you like geese?
i love this video SO MUCH DUDE
this is why i look forward for any friday… not for the weekend, but for Kurtis.
4:30 I had a dream i made custom strawberry shortcake rollarblades and then lost my family.
kurtis complaining about a to feel list while wearing an affirmations shirt is my new aesthetic 😍
this is comedy gold
This is so fucking funny, I want to show my dad this video bc he does shit like this unironically, he SWEARS by cold showers and I think he's insane
the mustache has little tarantula fangs on your philtrum
Based Kurt
Ratz
That whole To Feel List is literally just straight out of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Like dude, that wasn't supposed to be a suggestion....
Kurtis' morning routine would kill me in one day.
My morning routine is that I sleep for 2 more hours and then hate myself
its my birthday
Kurtis I legit think you have a hard time adapting or feeling comfortable in new environments
I know this is unrelated, but my mum thinks Kurtis is evil. I don't know why.
It said make the smoothie, not drink it.
THE ALPHA BREATHING I CAN NOT
About time Uncle Kurt
youve peaked man, no way youre gonna be able to top this banger in 2022
In that time how much money did you make? Way more then 99% of us I made $210 yup my life sucks
Kurtis Conner is SO alpha right now.
The way Kurtis built the puzzle gave me slight anxiety
Plot twist: an over and over repeated to do list will become routine if it works for you. Don't forget to breathe, kids!
I am not saying that billionaires don't have an easier path to being a billionaire but I would warn not to equate equal outcome to equal opportunity. Also I know your having fun but...these are proven methods to achieving goals....so there is something to it.
I was like "oh smoothies aren't that bad" but then he brought out the avocados
Cold showers DO actually wake you up a bit. I can tell Kurtis was a bit more perky afterwards.
i still think making the bed is pointless, but i just turned 25 so i still have 2 years to learn that so i wont think about that now :)
it didnt work because you didnt make your bed right when you woke up
Great video
woah kurtis’ eyes are crazy cool
Where THE EXTRA GREADING??!!
Kurtis your handwriting... woah bud
Was that a fart reveal?
Me watching this while waiting in line for four hours to get covid tested. Bless America 🇺🇸
The billionaire has never made a smoothie in their life. Probably their chef or cook made the smoothie for them and he had no idea what the ingredients were. You don't put water in a smoothie, you put ice in it!
Honestly Kurtis it sounds like you're addicted to coffee.
Kurtis hellofresh sucks, everything is bland as hekk
LOVED this video!! Kurtis this was so much fun to watch & I can tell you really enjoyed yourself making this. (Even tho these tasks were rediculous) hahah. Make more stuff like this!
i will be doing the beta morning schedule for the rest of my life now. Sure, I'll die in 2 and a half weeks but it'll be worth it
Kava tea is basically bedtime tea
"THATS MY BOY" made me smirk devilishly
My brain training is Nintendo 3Ds "Big Brain Academy"
Ah!
My ADHD brain can't even go through 1 minute of this boring ass billionair video if Kurtis didn't react to it. And also, I don't have time to recall my dreams or meditade in the morning I GOTTA GO TO WORK.
"To become a billionaire, you inevitably have to exploit the working class."  Kurtis just earned double respect from me
couldn’t focus on the video… kurtis’s fabulous stache distracted me the whole video 💔
Maybe we should change the name of Kurtistown to Kurtis Commune.
It was a bad idea for me to watch this while doing my testosterone injection because LET ME TEL YA it's terrifying to try and hold back laughter while there's a needle fully submerged in my leg
The bed dream means... You're going to be chosen to be the next Hooter's CEO. Congratulations.
Dammmmnnnn, I wish my mom (US) would let us have a lockdown 😞
4:53 THE WAY I DOUBLE TAKED WHEN HE SAID I GET UP BEFORE JENNA I FORGOT HIS GF IS JENNA TOO AND I WAS LIKE KURTIS HOW DO YOU KNOW
I loved this 😂😂
i need an entire video of kurtis just bullying rich white guys
can we get a freaking plant tour, man? your apartment looks like a small jungle and I'm here for it!
Everybody posting but Drew. You gotta roast his ass Kurtis. Half an hour just going in on his videos and his personal life
Oh damn I'm early!!
I'm sick and this video reminded me that my mom sent me a care package and it had Echinacea tea in it lol. I credit you for saving my day
So what I have to do to become a billionaire is, get drunk, stalk the Instagram pages of everyone who ever went to my school, then make an ultra exclusive website just for people who go there, then I’ll screw over my best friend and slowly buy him out of the company accept he doesn’t know and gets no money. Ok good
Hey did the bestie picks bae thing go Well for your friend?
You bring me so much *joy*, Kurtis — eem though you aren’t a billionaire. 😔
This morning routine sounds like things to do if you have depression and you are trying to get better 😂
What's interesting about the first part is that he's right. (He's wrong about everything else though). Dreaming allows your brain to process emotions and things that happened during the day without GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid)- the neurotransmitter in your brain responsible for regulating anxiety. It allows your brain to process negative things logically without any extra fear.   This is why when you don't sleep well, you have a worse day than you would have if you got a good nights sleep. This is also why if you have a bad day, you often feel better the next morning.   Dreams don't actually mean anything, its just random shit your brain shows  you. Thats why they don't make sense.   Anyway, try to get enough sleep, it's very important!
imagine taking a cold shower in ontario in january-
here's my i have $11 to my name morning routine: drink water , drink coffee , really quick journaling , brush teeth and wash face , then the rest of my day starts
Okay this video was so fucking funny, but on a more serious note: definitely start meditating in small amounts! It makes it much easier to focus when you ease yourself into it.
Kurty my partner and I are planning a road trip to Canada, where's the best places to visit and see the nature?
Since you started being a billionaire in the morning, your skin looks dewy and you look bright eyed and bushy tailed.
I like cool showers and get the apple at Panera… can I still live in Kurtistown?
his insults get more unhinged with every video lmaoo
kurtis please stop eating worms 😭 we’re worried about you
just woke up, video says recall my dreams, i’m not kidding you i dreamt that kurtis conner made a clone to replace a fan who had built a big treehouse and didn’t want to be on camera, and then kurtis broke his treehouse so. interpret as you will.
Kurtis: *uploads* Me: *throws notebook and pencil on the floor and opens youtube*
Wow. I scrolled myself into being early.
This dude sounds like David Spade but buff
When are u gonna make empath boiz phenomenon kurt
he looks like he could teach an 80s dance aerobics class with that hair & mustache, love it
bless you and danny for making our morning🕺🏽
These kinds of videos are hilarious. They’re like your setting a video game world record video, so good
didnt skip the 15 second ad i got during this video cause i was shitting. ur welcome for the money mr mayor :)
burt
This is freaking hilarious😂😂😂. I love watching you🤣🤣🤣
Omg the breathing 💀
When he said “my doctor said I was eating too many worms” I literally shot faygo moon mist out of my nose. Thanks Kurtis 😀👍
6:36 gotta be the face i make when someone said something but i’m pretending like i understood them the first time
no one gonna talk about the transformation into john oates?  just me?
are weeks different in canada (american)
Kurtis pronouncing spinach like “spin-nidge” is sending me
seeing what kurtis' house looks like feels illegal
The dream means your subconscious doesn’t agree with your eating/drinking habits
16:03 I totally understand Kurtis, you're not alone.
Body Shame Billionaires 2022 😤
gotu kola is an herbal tea that tastes like rootbeer! its really good actually! i got it at a local tea shop so u might not be able to get it unless they deliver! also if u add yogurt to the spinach avocado blueberry mix its easier to drink  its creamy. i do it by taking it like a shot. only 1 serving of each so its not so much to drink. im not a millionaire im just a health nut.
kurt boy this is such a good video oh my god i haven’t laughed this hard in so long
Side note, but the guy who speaks in the video, Jim Kwik? That translates to Jim Oink in polish, just wanted you to know.
The only thing I will ever do after waking up in the morning is falling asleep again
how is kurtis literally glowing after waking up
Hey, stop wineing.
You are a bowl of rice crispies.
SMOKING MEATS
Kurtis, you need to fix your mustache...
I'm so thankful for this, most days I just wake up and choose violence then things  spiral from there
KURTIS CONNOR CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS MOMENT
why did i think you were talking about lil terrio when you said Ontario😭
the global self hypnosis affirmations merch <3
You cured my shin splints
that alpha breathing part looked like it was straight out of a horror movie.
I don't even notice the Moustache anymore
“Sorry bitch. ‘Be a good partner’ was yesterday.” idk why this made me more attracted to Kurtis
You should of added more water
Also I was crying out for you to put a banana in that sludge of a smoothie
I bet the morning routine of the people who work for that guy is this Wake up Go to work Go home Sleep
Kurtis is effing halarious dude
I'm broke but i actually enjoy cold showers, i feel personally attacked :(
"Blast Thomas the tank engine and think about your sins" To be fair I listen to breakcore while working and it kinda slaps if you wanna be sent to a diffirent diemension
"I'm playing brain games" is what I said to my teachers when they asked why I was playing flash games on Cool Math Games
the thing is is if you body shame billionaires, it also shows that you think that way about features on others so its just a good rule of thumb not to body shame at all, bc if a fan with a bigger left eye or wtv sees that it'll make them most likely feel insecure, so it isn't just jeff bezos ur body shaming
okay but hear me out, it's 43°c where I live I NEED a cold shower
His mustache still looks wierd to me i mean in the words of kurtis him self "SHAVE IT OH MY GOD SHAVE IT"
I hate to admit this but that breathing thing… I actually enjoyed that like it felt like the air was just hitting my mouth different so that’s weirddd
If you like socialism so much why don't you go to one of those countries the CIA keeps destibalizing
"man i gotta exercise? aaaaawwwww man... but okay" "YOU TAKE THIS CUP OF COFFEE FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"
I'm watching this with covid and that breathing segment gave me anxiety.
I loved this. You’re very entertaining, regardless of if it’s humor content or other stuff. Fun to see a different type of video from you. Keep on keepin on
Oh my GOD please do a video of you watching the cats movie
No way you are gonna eat that much worms
Major Kurtis is helping me get through my 10 day isolation, the best major taking care of his citizens
is it just me or does the guy in the video sound like ryan reynolds
I thought he said he "saw spiderman" as in actually saw spiderman himself at the airport and missed his flight 💀
very happy to see a video in my feed :)
Peeing on the bed symbolizes that you make mistakes on your own accord
.needed more tim and a lil more water in that smoothie. lol
i want a video that's just 30 minutes of kurtis roasting billionaires
The Thomas & Mistakes part of the morning ritual really made me ponder… Ponder? I hardly know her.
I wish Curtis would go full mask off and just become a breadtuber. He could be great.
i'll take a COLD bath me:  NO WAY NO NO NO NO NO IM NOT DOING THAT I'LL DIE
Can I get the link to “horny Kurtis” GIF
Holy fuck this video was funny
Jesus christ I nearly peed myself during your alternative routine. Very funny man.
Kurtis's face after drinking that smoothie was absolutely priceless, poor guy, he was trying his best
We love a class-conscious king
Damn….you look really good for just waking up, bro.
my god, kurtis has such a nice fucking house
thank you for posting dad
Most elite 30 minute lunch break I’ve had in a minute
COMRADE KURTIS
I like your actual routine better
I really really like this video, u switched it up a bit and it paid off well (:
sell your moustache hair on ebay and wish, wish for the left side and ebay for the right
liver king 😃🙌  wait wrong vid
I’d watch a full video that was just Kurtis making fun of billionaires
Making fun of billionaires is possibly the funniest shit ever and I don’t know why
My billion dollar routine is wake up eat banana 🍌 again and again with banana and then stick it in go to work and make coffee ☕🙂 thanks for YouTube xo 💜😍
you have to give us at LEAST this much kiwi content per video from here on out
Do it for a month. What a god awful routine.
Very nice, Impressive, now let's see how many of those billionaires are jewish.
Billionaires are not real people. Money isn’t real, humans made it up.
i'm early and it' weird cus i've been watching your old videos and the thought of seeing a f r e s h one weirded me out.
Kurtis was lowkey slaying in this video
“Ontario has gone into a lockdown” *sighs longingly in American*
You hurt my feelings about the eye thing Kurtis Conner
3:11 what the FUCK your hair is so fabulous??? it’s so shiny and it suits you so well! mullet was the best decision you’ve made edit: i know you’ve had it for so long but i really like it long
that breathing part was more terrifying than the entirety of fnaf security breach
Best video!!
This video is perfect to watch while finishing my murder mystery y/n Blue’s Clues fan fiction from 8th grade.
I think the breathing made me laugh the most 😂
Me and my brother were at home playing video games together because we were home alone and he won the game. He told me I was a loser. I went on  to win every game, and then I said “who’s the loser now?” Then everybody clapped.        Easy to say we were terrified of the hundreds of people outside our window who were watching us for hours. We ran to my room and put my dresser against the wall. They walked in because it’s a pull door from the outside. He sacrificed me since I beat him and they killed me. Then everybody clapped.
Hi kurtis
kurtis i swear i love you
That mullet is mullety
“You’ve all heard that if you could win the morning, you can win the day”  Mf I wake up at 2pm 😂
Love living in ontario 🥲👍
Kurtis your mustache is having it's two dogs kissing era
what kind of dog is that i must have one
The only rich person that I respect is the one millionaire living in my town who donates all his money to charity, drives a ford pickup from the 90s, and lives in a two story house out in the middle of no where.
how could kurtis say "god is so thick" without saying thats what she said, right after, im disapointed
That smoothie pouring was an ASMR moment🥰
This video had me rolling and I’m only 10 minutes in!
Day
The recent re-quarantine has only made you more funny. Also the only body shaming I find moral is body shaming rich assholes
Nice

60% of billionaires are completely self made (started their own company without any big supplements or whatever), around 25% are partially self made (grew up priveliged but took risks to get where they are today) and about 13% inherited their fortune
I’m watching this in my campus commons and desperately trying not to laugh bc I don’t wanna look weird 😭😭

You do have to work up to 20 minutes of meditation, I think; it definitely takes practice, and it can be like a workout. That's why the first basics sessions of Headspace are all around ten minutes.

Noooo, Kurtis, I have one eye that’s slightly smaller than the other. 🥲
what? no tax evasion in this video? inaccurate
I love your videos so much, they always make me laugh. :)
we have the same brita filter mine is just teal
I am in love with you
I only eat half worms
I missed you
Why do you still have your christmas tree up
No i fajnie, widać że dużo napracowanka było.
lol when Kurtis said that mediating was nice, I immediately downloaded headspace cause i'm trying to have what he's having
I love you
Kurtis progressively looking more like an 80s Dad is honestly one of the greatest things I’ve watched for the past year.
dang ur alpha breath stinks
WOw, Jeff looked good with his eyeball fixed. You'd think he could afford to get that done.
i wish i had a mullet so i could look that terrible /j
i laughed so much i love you kurtis FUCK
I blame Curtis for the rise in mullets.
Me watching you drink brain smoothies while I’m devouring a party size bag of Doritos like  👁 👄 👁
The alpha breathing had me dying
my lip started twitching during the weird breathing bit and i think thst means something so can you please not do it again?
I smashed the like button the moment you started body shaming billionaires, keep up the good work
Hey Kurtis! In that first dream, i guess you could say that after seeing Spiderman you had…   no way home?
“Yea I think that’s that’s fine I think that’s what I learned as well I think that’s I think that’s fine I think what I also learned was diamonds are everywhere and you only gotta lad I learned- I didn’t learn anything.” - Kurtis Conner, March 26 2021
Ah its so thicc
writing down your dreams is actually really fun, cause it helps you learn how to lucid dream. you notice your subconscious patterns and get deeper insights on your life.  if not, it's also just fun to read after while :)
i think Jim Kwik's brain drinks have something to do with the brain damage he got as a child that affected his memory retention and problem-solving skills. a lot of his brand is just improving the brain and stuff.
Didnt you do a sponsorship with amazon
Thank you for sacrificing your comfort for this experiment. Very informative, very epic
I used to work in a juice/smoothies bar and every day someone would come with an atrocious smoothie recipe like the one in the video. It would taste horrible but they were always searching for something "detox" (No juice is going to detoxify anything. You already have a whole organ inside your body doing that).
Did it work? Are you a billionaire?
kurtis .... why didn't you just make a better smoothie :(
as a WoC, no white man makes me laugh harder than Kurtis. dare i say, he’s the only one.
🤤ITS 🥸ABOUT😈 DRIVE👀 ITS 👶ABOUT✨ POWER🥵
Your house decor is so nice it looks cozy
Some people I watch on youtube suggest daily routines. People do listen to them and I always think they mean well but what normal person has time to do this? They must all be business owners or influencers themselves
BABE WAKE UP KURTIS CONNER POSTED
I need a full video of you making fun of billionaires’ appearance… thank you 😊
ITS FRIDAY !
This is PERFECT I have like 35 minutes to kill and this is basically the exact length.
Dang your alpha breath stinks
do you and danny always post at the same time?
I'm gonna try to do this move for 2 minutes a day and drink nasty brainjuice thing and see how it works out. That should at least make me a millionaire.
I’m scared someone in the world is actually gonna do what he said at the end 😂
The longer his mullet grows longer YouTube videos he makes
would actually love a video of you just making fun of old rich guys... a podcast episode perhaps? owo
18:15 fucking diarrhea
I was listening to your podcast announcing that this video would be out, when it came out.
i loved this video and would love to see more content like this!! also kurtis if you haven’t seen the video of mark zuckerberg admitting he’s not human you have to watch it
Brockhampton went on a fucking hiatus and im sad as fuck thanks for posting
100% better than the magician video
YESSS YOU AND DANNY POSTED TOO
I had a dream last night that I was in a deadly puzzle house where I had to kill a shark- how is processing that going to make me into a millionaire
18:18 dude you forgot to add water 😂
depression’s been kicking my ass lately and this made made me laugh today. thanks kurtis
22:27 hey is that a teaser for an upcoming vid my guy
Omggg
Why did the “you feel nothing today” feel so personal😭😭
some other gems is definitely human brains
watching kurtis make that smoothie hurt me so much
This man ain’t living like a billionaire he living like a guy who wants to be a billionaire
dang ur alpha breath stinks
The alpha breathing almost knocked me out 😭😭😭😭
We don't take kindly to billionaires round these parts. YEE YEE
I think the peeing in the bed dream just signifies that you have some unchecked kinks you need to sort out :)
Glad to know that everybody is uploading. Kurtis, Danny, Noel, Scott, Ethan, Jacob, Memeulous, Kelsey, MacDoesIt, Jarvis, Roomie, Jordan, Keisha, ImAllexx... damn!
this guy might be rich but he is also very stinky because brushing his teeth isn’t a part of his morning routine???
come to Brazil
Make a video of you just roasting billionaires.  PLEASE.
Dang ur alpha breath stinks
dany gonalas
So now I get to buy My. Dew and Cosmic brownies on the way home.
woke up to Kurtis, Danny, and Noel videos I’m about to be so unproductive 😎😌
YAY KURTIS I MISSED YOU
Very recently binged Code Lyoko, so hearing that your dog is named Kiwi is really wild.
I wake up in the morning, drink a probiotic, meditate a little, do some stretching, a little tai chi. The fuck is he journalling about, how well the stretching went? The day's JUST started, save that shit for the evening when you have some day to reflect on, at this point in the morning I'm not even thinking of anything, my journal would read like "welp, woke up. So far so good, I guess. I'm thirsty." Real deep "living my best life" shit :P Where are my billions? :P
drink brain tea = become billionaire 💯
my right eyeball is way bigger then my left going to cry now
Kiwi
off topic but i love ur house
E
Now we need a house tour
dang ur alpha breath stinks
'I make my brain smoothie-'  hmm I know we say billionaires are aliens or robots, but I'm starting to think they're zombies tbh
dang ur alpha breath stinks
I'm quite early if I do say so my self
Need this video right after BROCKHAMPTON quit
This is hilarious because I just started a Relaxation/Breathing class and I almost fell asleep after. Like, I definitely wouldn't do it right after I woke up, since it'd make me go right back to bed.  Also i find it funny that I was building a puzzle while watching this
I’m editing you eating the brain smoothie into the meat smoothie video
I love being taught how to alpha breath by Connor Roy
the breathing just ruined my life
The face you make at 6:28 you look exactly like Stacy from zoey 101 😂 I can hear the lisp from here
I've never seen anyone so full of hatred lol  ..
Lmao "20 minutes is too long to be alone with my own thoughts" most relatable quote I've heard about meditation
“We’re human beings not human doings” yeah well some of us have to DO work because we don’t wanna end up BEING homeless you absolute dummy
Bruh I wake up in the morning and I have max 30 minutes to eat, shower, get dressed, do my homework, and drive to school 💀😂
I’m not gonna lie, I want to steal the whole making-bed, meditating, tea drinking, journaling, reading thing. Don’t think it’ll make me a billionaire but I can see how that’ll improve the quality of life!! Who the hell has time to do all of those things though
having your notifs on is a godsend
How were you not screaming from the cold showers?
Anti-capitalist Kurtis is all I need. thank you kurtie boy.
i write my dreams down almost every morning why am i not a billionaire
I think that billionaires take cold showers because they probably live somewhere warm. If they lived where it was -40 degrees, they'd probably have a tub that boiled them like soup.
Haven’t even watched this yet but I just wanted to say I LOVE these types of your videos!!!
“Live, laugh, love? “ Nah, billionaires use “do, feel, be” 😈 💸
Fck, you're too funny man! Love you Kurtis!
TODAY IS TRULY A DAY TRYING TO KEEP ME HAPPY!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE POST!!!!
curtiz condor
kurtis get rid of those curly snakes on your shoulders
spinij
Who the hell makes all these lists every day. Like what? This is so weird if someone actually does that.
Kurtis put your Christmas tree away 🤷‍♂️
what a wonderful friday
Overcast in his mouth. Omg I can't 😭🤣
4:30 the sentence "my doctor got mad at me for eating too many worms" is probably the funniest thing i have ever heard, i was laughing so hard i was in pain
The Walmart ad in between felt personal
at first I thought yhe dude said alpha breeding instead of alpha breathing and I like my version better
“dang ur alpha breath stinks”
Did someone else also started doing the alpha tongue nonsense thing while watching without noticing?
As a professional dream interpreter I can tell you that that dream means that you really want to piss on a hotel bed. You’re welcome.
Me standing here with one eye bigger than the other🧍🏽‍♀️
Ugh. Why'd you bring up taxes.
yayyyyyyyyy hot kurtis content
kurtis why didn't you put any ice in your smoothie. have you never made a smoothie before
Bingo hall of fame 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YOU FORGOT YOUR PROBIOTICS
Yessssss love
This video was posted 20 minutes ago- no one's even finished the video yet and it has 3.6k likes lol
Sheesh Danny and Kurtis vid in the same day Crazy
kurtis u have bad handwriting.. also uh good video
The only reason I'm against body shaming billionaires is because someone watching this video might have the same features, not because I care about them.
Seeing Kurtis outside of his little room video set up made me UNCOMFORTABLE I CANG BELIEVE THE KURTISVERSE EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THAT ROOM
rich people always say that you can also become rich because they want to believe that their success is purely based on skill and hard work and not mostly on luck eventhough its not
Dang! Your alpha breath stinks. 🤮
Here before guy without a mustache
Last night I had a dream I had a pet Raccoon that I was trying to put in my car do you guys think I’ll be a billionaire?
"...and yes, I am body shaming."  he says whilst wearing a sweatshirt that says "please be nice to me".    it's also dave grohl's birthday today so happy birthday dave
“God it’s so thick”   That’s what she said.
That “alpha breathing” part gave me so much anxiety…
Where's the part where you exploit your workers?
Body shame billionaires, as a treat
16:50 I read the monkey book and I was so disappointed when he said money book, legitimately thought we were going to see Kurtis boy learn how to become a monkeh
Using that clip of Cedric’s dad was FOUL
I love how all the views are still watching this 😌
”We’re not human doings, we’re human beings” Well your not cringing. You are cringe.
The close up of those Warren Buffett teeth. 🥴  Why Kurtis? 🤮
Can you give your thoughts on the comedian Jim Jefferies?? I'm interested in your view on his stand-up!
Kurtis Drone?? I hardly know her
12:24 I think your dream means I don't wanna clean your hotel room if I go back to house keeping. 😬😬
Heehee
i blocked jim kwik so fast on his social media as soon as he started watching this billionaire video thing...and i didn't even know this guy existed before nor have i ever seen anything of his anywhere...but the cringe was just too much.
I wake up, and i take my morning line of Brain Cocaine.
You can be a billionaire, sure, but definitely can't be a multi-billionaire
YES
“Your allowed to body shame billionaires” lol
Kurtis you already failed the first day because you breathed before you made your bed
Kurtis posted?? “EWWW”
Love your vids kurtis makes me happy you see you upload again anyway keep up the good work gl
u fr post whenever i feel sad
Fuckin mullet and mustache lookin dope
Most people who take cold showers take a warm one and then turn it to cold for like 10-30 seconds
i cheered when he finally cracked the hardly know er joke
I like to think the VRG in the back is rly V*G like it’s VAG censored
Kurtis making my 2 weeks of being stuck inside better
this is communist propaganda >:(
Hiiiiiiiiiii
i’ve been watching old kurtis vids from pre-mustache era bc i’ve been bored and i have covid and when i opened this and saw The Stache™️ i almost had a heart attack
Did u even get in the shower half of ur hair is dry
if kurtis didn't underpay his employess, he failed the assignment /j
It's such a great feeling to go to the channel because you missed kurtis' videos to unexpectedly find a new video :')
You got me at "Today, I'm an elephant" 😂
Ah yes a billionaire who has to have their morning routine video sponsored, to make the video...
This whole routine is obviously absurd, but for real what even is that "breathing technique." It's so weird.
Why am I attracted to Kurtis
To be honest, I agree with most of the morning routine. It’s similar to stuff my therapist has suggested I add to my routine.. I think being in touch with yourself and your body is a good thing. But this… definitely isn’t a billionaire routine…. This is a “my therapist said that maybe routine could help with my severe depression and anxiety” routine
DANNY AND KURTIS MAKING MY QUARANTINE BETTER HOLY SHIT
are we gonna ignore the meditation lady saying “come and go”
When Kurtis posts a new video, my day is made（╹◡╹）♡
Holy shit that billionaire video you went through is so fucking funny 🤣
Billionaire? Damn that's a lot of loony toons
Jeff bezos’ muscles just inflated too
By better u mean present, my mental health just went absent since 2020. Been skipping the video meetings.. 😞✌🏻
the kurtstache looks great in this video
12:22 i think that means Kurt secretly has a piss kink
Honestly Kurtis your life on a normal day is probably more enjoyable than any billionaire
box breathing is a therapeutic technique to reduce anxiety and calm you down, but alpha breathing is so much better because it improves your alpha-ness and makes you one badass business man.
babe wake up, new kurtis :3
so much serotonin
Genuinely read billionaire as ballerina so… I was confused
the breathing joke sent me over the edge
7:44 i laughed
Kurtis could just make a video of his dreams and I would piss myself laughing😂
never fail to make me laugh kurtis :D thanks mate
WAIT LMMAO NOT JEFF BEZOS SHAMING elkdekekLSDKDKEKF
Interesting
egg
That breathing wasn't something I should've watched before going to bed
dang ur alpha breath stinks
Just finished watching Danny’s Liver King video and refreshed my notifications to see this!! Double bangers in one day
Kurtis invented the Metaverse no cap
Steps to become a billionaire -  1. Be born extraordinarily wealthy 2. Hire people and take their surplus value
thank you for the treat ♥️ hehehehhe
3:15-3:35 would’ve been even funnier with a picture of Gary vee slowly shifting into focus
i want what hes having
I propose billionaires actually try sigma breathing
“Im the one who pisses and shits outside, he’s just reminding me”  Holy fuck I did not expect that, that killed me dude 😂😭
THIS IS SO FUNNY N ENTERTAINING 😭
KURTBOY
Oh my god...this dude is so fool of himself. The ultra wealthy really do think highly of themselves since they are treated as such.. like who told this guy that to make a video about his morning routine? Like he is a billionaire cuz makes his bed, drink water and do "Alpha breathing." His voice sounds so self important.  They start to believe that their mindset must be special and why they are rich... not the fact that they exploit the working class, get tax breaks, get governments subsidies, have offshore accounts and have a deregulated market and workplace..   Nope they must be special..
Homophobic
Why is sleepy Kurtis so adorable?  😂
Who else been watching Kurtis Conner reruns????😩😩😩 I miss him!
AYOO KIRT MAH BOY POSTED? LETS GOOO FOR A GOOD 2022--
6:26-6:49 felt way longer than it was
'I make my brain smoothie-'  hmm I know we say billionaires are aliens or robots, but I'm starting to think they're zombies tbh
I just eated my lunch watching danny's vid and now im finishing my dessert watching kurtis. Thats what i call a funky friday
DJ SCAMLIKELY LETS GOOOOOO
I’ve missed you Kurtis
Off topic, but all these bots in peoples reply sections promoting there onlyfans is so fucking annoying.
I never noticed Jeff Bezos eyeball 😰😰😰
billionaires eat their weight in worms everyday. Why? Because they can afford it
my dreams are def not telling me what i need to do if so i would need to meet up every kpop star and go to space with them but also be getting attacked by the burger king mascot then we would all die. come back from the dead and fight the wendy’s mascot while hunting down ronald mcdonald
Today, I’m an elephant   Not a good elephant
Was waiting since last podcast episode like if my hair would fall out and burn
Kurtis you god… be my father?
9:48 bro literally stole that from a simpsons episode bruh 😭
finally someone has the balls to call out billionaires for being big baby losers
Watching this while I work out 🥰
Babe wake up Kurtis posted a new video
komrade kurtis
KURRRRRRRRRRRRRRTIIISSSSSSS
Why am I just finding out that Kurtis also lives in Ontario…
FYI, if you have coffee at a moderate amount its actually somewhat beneficial to your health
thanks for the video... it's my almost-birthday and i'm in my room all alone just crying... needed some company
Hey Kurtis, I’m a doctor. I just wanted to let you know that the correct number of worms to eat a day is 7. Don’t worry, if you just work really hard, like a billionaire, then you will be able to eat enough worms!
im loving kurty becoming increasingly openly sick of it and radical on his channel. spread the gospel baby!! go lil rockstar!
DANNY, SCOTT AND CURTIS IN THE SAME FEW HOURS?! AM I RECALLING MY DREAMS RN???
how did we end up here
ALPHA BREATHING IS NOW ONE OF MY TOP 3 FEARS IM SOBBING WHAT IS THIS
Doctor getting mad about eating too many worms could be the brain processing what to do in situations when you are doing abnormal things and you fear how authority figures will react to it, so you are practicing scenarios similar to that.
YASSS KURTIS I MISSED YOU SO MUCH ILY
I know someone already gave thanks for you and Danny making their day better, but today has really been hard for me. I was waken early by someone who was right outside my house being loud asf, and I had also awaken from a terrible dream that just ruined my day from the start. I have nothing to do today and I just feel really empty and drained, watching your guys’ videos always cheer me up, so thank you again ☺️ <3
“Overcast in his mouth” is 100% an insult I’m going to use VERY often
Eat your cheese
man i picked the perfect day to stay home sick from school lmao
“My body hurts all the time.”   I see you are a man of culture.
Omg post day twinsies with Dannyyyy
my favorite notification omg
Eating worms in your dreams symbolizes your overworked or fatigued.
BINGO HALL OF FAME
I was doing that Alpha breathing exercise with you Kurt boy.... and I almost DIED lol, longest 8 seconds of my life 😅
I'm literally struggling to get through this video I cannot stop laughing
Thought I was gonna be early but there’s alr so many comments 😐
so basically, at the beginning, you were trying to say you're turning into an old man kurtis
kurtis always gets so much anxiety when he tries to do breathing exercises 😭😭😭
why you so stinky now.........
CANT WAIT TO WATCH it’s so thick 😩
"I think my mental health could be..... better" I think that explained my entire life.
Danny and Kurtis uploads on the same day. Almost at the same time, this is the best day ever.
11:24 your morning routine list is longer than your actual To do list for the rest of the day
I'm at work and can't watch yet but just came to comment because I'm surprisingly early!
Kurtis would be such the stereotypical middle school bully to rich kids, like- He just seems like the person to say a yo mama joke to an entitled rich kid and just sit there and stare at them while they cry
“bingo hall of fame” amazing
hip
Ever seen Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie? They didn't exploit the working class, they just ran the swallow valley mall! Man I love that BILLION DOLLARS!
Pissing, shitting, throwing up cant believe I got here so early-
kurtis, this year won’t suck because I got your videos 🤩🤩🤩
I REALLY appreciate the effort Kurtis puts into making his videos. thank you!
Billionaire... not impressed 🙄. Next time try living like a Gazillionaire
We stan a socialist king👑
unsubscribing cuz kurtis is a stinky little beta breather ☹️ you cant deny it
I had a dream where there was a house and a movie theater were combined and I was a FNAF night guard and Roxy was like a nightmare version and she was trying to kill me so i guess if I write it down it will solve my subconscious issue and the billions will start to roll in eh
dang your alpha breath stinks
danny and kurty posting at the same time is single-handedly curing my covid
the intro omg I love it
So far this is quite honestly one of my favorite Kurtis videos
That breathing bit was hilarious
kurtis! you forgot the part where you evade taxes and exploit child labour !
Double upload??? Can we do another trio upload????
I can't BELIEVE you didn't get out of your bed and make your bed!! How did you expect this to work???!!!!!
BANGER VIDEO
Anyone else get covid after fighting it off for 2 years??!!
Now I just want a 30 minute video of Kurtis coming up with insults and things he wants to do with billionaires
ig we're just getting served with content today boys🤤
nice video
Alpha breathing is just screaming ALPHA while breathing
i havent watched it yet but i rate it 15/9
Just the title alone wounds me emotionally.
Dang your alpha breath STINKS
kurtis, you’ve already made 2020 100% better. thank you from all of the residents of kurtis town.
Proletarian Kurtis let’s go!
we have the same crewneck btw
This is the earliet i have ever been
I can confirm there is a right amount of worms to eat
These kinds of videos make being rich sound horrible, why does it inspire anyone
why is this pinned
this ones so long its gotta be good
i love how his shirt says please be nice as he roasts all the billionares in this world
KURTIS STOP CURSING US
its a new year, so where's my extra greeting? not gonna get one? well...okay fine...dude
How to be a billionaire: - Don't have a girlfriend  - Catcall women - Work hard - Make people work hard for you - Get lucky - Never get lucky, only work hard.
I will post thirst comments for kurtis until he politely replied me to stop or not he can do whatever he wants
Not Kurtis not knowing which side is left and which one is right
Mullet is so thriving! Good looks Kurt!
Hey Kurtis, did you know you were named after The Lizard from Spiderman?
Hi kurty! Just wanted to say that you've inspired me to try out stand-up comedy (currently taking a stand-up comedy class in college rn). I know it's barely been a month but I hope you go on tour again :)) Please do a show in Baltimore!
CEO entrepreneur born in 1994 ...Kurtis..kurtis conner
curtis konar??
It feels illegal to be this early 😩 and thank you mayor Kurtis for always making my day <3 I love being a part of Kurtistown
good golly miss molly i’m so early
WOOO
"You know 50 Shades of Gray was named after that guy's teeth"  Damn Kurtis, you did that man dirty. Dirty like his teeth.
YAY
Cool
dang that alpha breath really do stink tho
comrade kurtis is the energy i’m channeling in 2022. instead of affirmations we’re shaming billionaires
dang ur alpha breath stinks
i'm standing up for jeff bezos! if you're gonna shame his weird tiny eye, you also have to shame his weirdly turtley face. you can't pick and choose what you shame on a person, kurtis, that's insensitive. you gotta shame the whole package.
Kurtis and Danny upload yassss
that little clip of Kurtis dancing in the intro is the dance I do every time he uploads
“I’m in the worst shape of my life, I drink too much coffee and wine, my body hurts like all the time and my mental health could probably be better”  - Me, a disgruntled 25 year old who just barely survived my recent quarterlife crisis lol
The first 5 minutes just clowning billionaires already makes this one of the best vids on YouTube
isnt living like a billionaire just doing nothing while other people works their ass off??
I hit 1 year of sobriety today <3 thank you for posting, I consider it a present
i haven't even watched this video and I already know it's iconic
as if you don't live like a billionaire every week with that mustache
i feel like the holy trinity of commentary youtubers always post at the same time
YOOOO this is the earliest I’ve ever been to a YouTube video
Oh sheesh posted 5 minutes ago 😳
Thank u mayor
POINTS WERE MADE WITH THE BINGO HALL OF FAME 😂 you’re the best! (abbey sharp is an amazing dietician if you’re serious & would love her on the pod 🙌)
TIL warren buffet has 50 teeth
please take a break
Idk about you guys but personally I’m a huge fan of capitalism, it’s one of my favorite things
SLAY MATERIAL GWORL YASSS
very cool but you ate no babies :/ not realistic
“you’re allowed to body shame billionaires” ~ Kurtis Conner January 14, 2022
why live like a billionaire when you could be a lizard
Yassified billionaire
he's preparing for the future
Yes.
the mayor has evolved.
It's 3am here and i was about to sleep but i saw your name in the notification. Gotta watch the mayor's video asap. Sleep can wait.
moustache and mullet are looking especially exquisite today
First time ever watching a video when it came out, thanks time difference!
My 2022 resolution is to work and play as hard as thic Mark Zuckerberg
dang ur alpha breath stinks 😨
how are there 1.1K likes in three minutes
already watched the whole video due to my billionaire grindset
the mullet is really slaying
kurtis bae conner
Peepeepoopoo
i got my septum pierced a few hours ago 😎 prime time for kurtis to post
700th viewer on this video😏😏👈🏻
Hot take: Best Kurtis video in a while
Another reason to love Fridays 💚 when Kurtis uploads!!
Brilliant Video
Every day Kurtis looks more and more like an 80s porn star
Idk if it’s the Canadianess in him but Curtis is one of the most conscientious comedians out there right now, and he is what comedy should be #wokecomedy
This video was fake, if he really lived like a billionaire he'd be tweeting about space travel ideas that don't work and voting Republican.
been having a horrible week and I'm pretty sure I'm going into a mental hospital soon for my safety, but you uploading has temporarily cheered me up. fuck billionaires btw
I stole wine from my parent
did u get a new camera
Jeff Bezos is out, Kurtis Bezos is in.
I was just watching Danny and got this notification
YEAHHH NEW LIRT BIDEO
body shame billionaires 2022
AHH THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD
spoiling us with a half hour video
I mean the name Kurtis sounds like the name of a billionaire so this video was meant to be
Kurtis is honestly the only man with a mullet that i would trust holding my drink at a bar. Also, that hair is GORGEOUS
Kurtis is so good I might squeet.
1:22 CHEDDAR I HARDLY KNOW HER HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA (everyone shut up and pretend that cheddar ends with er)
great way to start off the weekend!! <3 u kurtis
Kurtis youre kinda on the in front of my screen rn can you scoot over a bit?
I love how no matter how much money Zuckerberg has, we still make fun of him for being a dork.
wow besties i’m so early
yuhh
Kurtis help i’m trapped in quebec pls rescue me and bring me back to kurtistown i hate it here
kurt boy, please open golf cards on stream please kurt, please         kurtis conner? i hardly know her.
2 minutes here fast!
honestly thought kurtis was gonna go warren buffett style and eat mcdonald’s breakfast every day for a week and call it a day
BRUH, for da first time I'm early for a video :O
fun fact: A bolt of lightning is five times hotter than the sun.
kurtis and danny?? what a great day
ah yes the perfect youtube video to watch while eating my chinese takeout and quarantining for covid :)
ok but how many squeet is ur home ☹️
When you're early and his shirt goes well with the yugioh disaster. pls be nice <3
First 1k gang
Today I learned Canadians say "sorry" so much that The Apology Act was passed in 2009, declaring that an apology can't be used as evidence of admission of guilt.
That award moment when Cody Ko proposes so now you have to wait a few months
Kurtis bezos
Welcome to 2020 season 3 kurtis.
RAN to this
starting off the day with a little bit of kurtis :)
I think this is the longest your mullet has ever been. (a positive thing)
A Canadian billionaire 🇨🇦🧐
sorry kurt-y,now we gotta eat you.. I dont make the rules.
5:35 “You haven’t even taken a breath yet??” 😂
You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for a Kurtis Conner video.
Old MTV would sponsor you in a heartbeat
this video is a lie. you are a billionaire already and this is how you live every day. kurtis how dare you lie to kurtistown like this.
Yay new vid thx kurtis✌️
Hayyyyy Kurt boi
*gone wrong!*
ive been looking forward to this all day
We can all agree that Kurtis never fails to entertain us
A mullet poor guy who’s faking to be a millionaire in the 21st century! Kurtis, do a react with Aaron and Jo
The video quality looks sooo nice! is it a new camera or am I tripping?
title: ‘i lived like a billionaire for a week’ montage: *smoothie making intensifies*
omg I have that same shirt wooow
I’m wearing that same sweat shirt in black and red
hey
even billions can’t fix that mustache smh (jk I love u Kurt cobain)
Kurtis pretending to be a billionaire is especially hard, seeing as he is a trillionaire so please be extra nice to him 😔
And I've been living like I'm broke since 9/12/2004 (my birthday)
comrade kurtis
Every time I watch a Spider-Man movie and they say curtis connors I simply cannot continue watching
