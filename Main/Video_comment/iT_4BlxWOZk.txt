I greatly apologize for the amount of enjoyment I got from hearing him say "I'm gonna wreck you"
No one  Absolutely no one Brandon: "watch out they look good" *eating  peppers*
He takes so long to upload cuz he’s always cleaning
I'm choking right now You made me laugh so hard dr pepper came out of my nose
Am I the only one who did this at 2 in the morning
As someone who has 17 recently dried Carolina reapers and about 20 scorpion peppers  Why munch them like that. I love spice but nah. I did my time crunching a fresh one. Not worth it lmao
3:22 Coom
idek why i laughed so hard at the "have some milk" part

Did anyone think you was going to land on his head when he did the front flip
I WAS FLABBERGASTED WITH THAT FRONT FLIP 😂
1:06 idk why I laughed so  much at this🤣 it was a good joke tho😂🖤
He just did a punch front on carpet… he’s a better gymnast than I’ll ever be 😭
Google midway through the video had a stroke bigger than normal
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 watch 1:35 through 2:08 trust me I died laughing
Did anyone go to the website I'm too lazy to check if he actually bought it

this guy honestly scares me
Well with how clumsy Brandon is the front flip was kind impressive
You remind me of the dude in cloudy with a chance of meatballs. He has spray on shoes I feel like you would do that 😂
It started out so well then had nothing to do with coffee...
"I also got scorpion peppers. that looks pretty good." *takes bite* "mother of Mary"
I laughed…way too hard at this💀
Youtube needs to fix itself the commercial was french i think
1:19 this looks like a movement that a skinny man would do in a Disney movie or like in a Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
cheese.
is nobody gonna talk about the fact he ate the hottest pepper discovered
I’m drinking iced coffee now while watching this
dID HE JUST DO A FLIP

"get wrecked milk"
i think this is how he takes his anger out

Him: knock on wood  Me: BrUnO?
What’s ur pronouns
i was think if you want to go out sometimes. To see the sun then make some booba with you. my guy

Netflix: Are you still watching? Someone's daughter: 3:24

I laughed so hard my sides hurt... love these videos
It’s sad that I am way younger (idk how old he is tbh)  then him and I can’t even do a cartwheel but this man can do a whole FREAKING FRONT FLIP
I think this guy might be HowToBasic
I'm so confused 😐???
U love cleaning u should get a job for cleaning 🤣🤣🤣
Can anyone tell me what his tattoo says? From what I can get in this video is. "Darn we disturbed the _____" my guess would be "peace." But still unsure.
brandon casually eating a carolina reaper has me astonished tbh
Oh my gosh my dishwasher was so impressed
"Here comes the pain!"
If your pets wached you do dis theyed be like human gon crazy

Try not to say Gods name like that Brandon. Say oh my gosh if you can try. Ily brandon and you all. God bless you all.
“Here comes the pain!!”  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Your mom
"woah Jeff Bazous that is hot-"              -Brandon Farris 2021   This phrase should be remembered it made me laugh so hard I love it, also Brandon you are always so funny and you need to do more videos with Cameron!!!

ㅤㅤ
What does your tattoo say
3:16 me when ur mom
i was half way through watching this and my mom called me down because one of my chickens went missing and i looked in the pool and it was dead. it was literally a month old, I'm crying badly :')
I don’t know who is worse, Jamie Oliver or Brandon
I saw that he was in a different kitchen out of all of the other cooking videos did he get and new house.. ...                              Trying to egnore the fact that he did a front flip.
this guy is the most awkward person i know but still manages to be social. just..very... awkwardly social.
How tf did he not hit his ceiling while flipping???/
Someone gonna check that website?

Can you please do egg nog
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂

"OH MY GOD that's a good pepper" -Brandon Farris- cause of death, scorpion pepper

Ah yes the James may cheese meme
Isn’t that Robbie’s old house

Me: AH yes the thumbnails again😂
Get wreck milkkkkk
Oh even the brups are spicy
I think it’s safe to say that I will not be eating any of the meals you prepare for me. I don’t want stocking mashed potatoes on your hairy leg in my mouth.
could NOT stop laughing!!!
so, Brandon is buff and can apparently do a front flip
So curious. Which house does he live in? 😅 i keep seeing 2 different questions and idk which are recent or not
Make out with your girlfriend
bro that front flip was fire! I think your dishwasher was very impressed!
The commitment...
Cups song on a whole new level grinding em coffee beans

Let's go Brandon! Let's go Brandon!
Buff Ginger Jesus
I love how he said coffee at the beginning THE WAY MY GRANDMA SAYS IT!!!🤣😂
Man's took a bite outta the hottest pepper in the world and had a tame reaction. What a Chad
This must of been so messy lol
"Got a habanero pepper..., it looks pretty good... *CRUNCH*!"😂
I love watching his videos but every time I do watch them I think to myself oh gosh no, why? Why do that especially right there. I would hate to be the one who cleans up after the videos 😂
This guy just did like 5 spicy pepper challenges randomly in one video props to him 😂
Funniest channel I have seen 😂🤣
Someone go to the website and tell me what the virus that may or may not exist does to your computer.
......I want to see him without a beard😶
Nice front flip
Pls tell me do you live in manteca
2:08 That's a spear, my fried friend.
Hi
Sir, are u alright T-T
this is probably my favorite video from him for google translate, its nearly impossible for me to watch it and not laugh
I died at the peppers XD
“Cya later’ 🤣
*casually does front flip*  WoWwwwW
A very important question Brandon.... why is this a different kitchen.... what happened to your office
Calcium covered kitchen 😂
ok but who cleans brandons kitchen????
I’m barely a minute in and I already had to pause twice because I’m laughing too hard
"cya later" XD
Casually eats the hottest pepper on the planet. What a mad man
“The question is who’s going to clean the mess”. 😹yes, that is always the question 🤣🤣🤣
Ima just-    🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
I’m 14  🧑‍🦯
The noise he made when he bumped into the wall after his front flip got me for some reason 🤣🤣🤣
We’ve watched this so much my boyfriend can quote it. Lol
OMG! WAS THAT BREAST MILK HE POORED IN HIS CUP?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aiden!! Can we get a video of JUST Google translate intros, PLEASE?! Aiden?!
I like how he made a spear using duck tape a plunger and a knife
🖤💀 the thumbnails are  what makes these videos  funny 😄 I srsly love watching this man he brightens my day. 🖤❤️thank you Brandon ❤️❤️🖤
how is one man coordinated enough to do a front flip on the ground, yet not coordinated enough to not run into a wall and slip on the ground…..
poop knife
Helpful tip for Brandon: Don't drink water after eating something hot, it'll only spread the spicy oils. Drink Milk
Really sounds like animal crossing music in the background. N i c e. Brewster would be proud
Bruh he used James May
I’m impressed with the flip 👏🏻
Okay but why does he have two kitchens?
Gentlemen were in paris btw
EvEn ThE BUrPs aRe sPiCy 🔥🥵  Me:☠️🤣

Perfect example of why random =/= funny
What was that one called? ÆęŪhâ -scorpion pepper—

is everyone just ignoring the baby bottle?
the thumbnail captures the exact moment he knew it went wrong
Not the animal crossing tune😂
Nickname in college…..feels like a dog at GMM lol
I love watching a man make coffee in a liminal space
I love how he doesn’t make his thumbnail not clickbate
“Agh it tastes like the ground” -Brandon
Ok but can we just all admire that flip at 4:42
Doesn't Brandon have the weirdest thumbnails that make you want to click the video
damn this guys has a stuntman
*Get Rekt Milk* “Famous last words”
“Aw- thats- spicy- coffee” my favorite part abt this whole video 😂
This is my kingdom come. This is my kingdom come.
I accidentally skipped to the end trying to make the video full screen and I just can't wait for whats in store!!
You know the video is gonna be epic when there's an explosion in the thumbnail
I got a serious problem watching this, its in the middle of the night and im trying to not wake my girlfriend up, but hard to resist to laugh! :)
The thumbnail: nuclear experience for Brandon          Title: GoGlE tRaaNslAte makes iced CoffE

3:23 *This is my kingdom come*
This is why u need a coffee grinder
"Even the burps are spicy"

-“my favorite” “God it tastes like the ground :)”
Brandon always makes me laugh lmao
Hahahahaha
3:23 OMFG
OMG Brandon I can always count on you too make me pee my pants! Thanks love ya 💜
I thought you deserved a like for eating really hot peppers especially when you bit a scorpion pepper 😕
He does a better front tuck than I’ve ever been able to do…and I’m in competitive cheer 😂☠️
3:23 play it at 0.25x speed and there is the thumbnail
if you dont collapse off your feet laughing in the middle of all his videos, your sense of humor needs a plunger.
“get wrecked, milk” auGhFdCgrFfuHAAhhhhh
did he just burn... plastic???
Google translate was so wrong that I forgot what he was making after the first minute
This channel is the greatest pick-me-up
3:23 Me after i go on the hub

Brandon: 3:23 Milk: nah, do it by yourself

How schools think boys react when a girl shows 1cm of their shoulder 3:23
Fireworks?     Uhh Fire Did not Works  this is unexpected
NGL Brandon kinda tone
1:04 villager noise !!  😌
This was very funny but it gave me anxiety over the immense amount a mess you made I’m just sitting here like dear God I’d rather die than clean all that up
I literally got chills when he spoke right into the mic in the beginning, that's what I get for turning my headphones up so loud
Is it just me who actually took the time to type the so called web page on google?
THE MILK PLEASEEEE- 😩😩
Someone check that website
Why does he sometimes change kitchen
The flip !!!!!
The fact that he just is casually eating the worlds hottest peppers😂
Brandon: does Brandon things then does a flip and does not mess it up     UM MY SIAIR HOW!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like he needs a clean up crew and stage kitchen to do these videos hahahahahha
Been watching for years but damn I love this one lol
I just know Gloria is going to walk in and be like again?!!? Seriously or not say anything and walk back out 🤣🤣🤣
As a barista I can confirm this is how me do it. Yes.
1:04     Minecraft villager activated
HOW did you front flip
hello sir brandon
2:48 I am sorry sorry sorry but like what!!!! Can some one explain this lol
Like the new home
I enjoy seeing somebody eat a bit of a Carolina reaper and not break down and cry, then eat an entire quart of ice cream whilst crying
Me playing minecraft: *starts tearing down the village and loots everything* Villagers: 1:04
The elbows lending into thing…. 🤣🤣
We can’t just ignore the fact that he did a FRONT FLIP just to impress us. WOW
this guy did  every pepper challenge on youtube
He should do this but he dose it the right and wrong way
When he said get wrecked milk the milk wrecked him 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear this is the funniest guy on the internet😂😂
3:23 when edp sees a 13 year old child
“Inhale your exhale”😂😂😂😂 I’m dying
are we just going to ignore the fact that he keeps switching houses
Is that an animal crossing music in the background? 😊
I’m wondering how many kitchens he has
THE FRONT FLIP
I can't be the only one who tried searching that code thing (then proceed to accidentally delete it all)
Warning: don’t eat while watching his vid I learned the hard way (I choked) 💀
Brandon:explodes coffee beans Starbucks:we could have used that🙄😢
you should be a voice actor brandon
5:00 'The last step... Mix & Enjoy. Kisses    Don't make it weird.'
So we aren’t talking about the baby bottle?

4:40 - UMM, WHAT!?!? Brandon is throwing front flips in his living room?! That was insane.

Who's house are you distroying right now 😂
Yaknow...him having a baby bottle for the milk makes alot of sense now
You are the most funniest person in the world
Yes. He impressed the dishwasher.
Hold on, is the link he made.. real?-
*Brandon eats spicy peppers* Brandon...why? xD
0:59 seconds and Brandon has already turned me on
The coffee bean joke is really funny now cause my nickname is coffee bean now in high school
This man did a backflip
03:16  WE WILL WE WILL WRECK YOU!
Ha🤣
To be honest that flip was solid , he even did a straight knees flip instead of tucking which is harder to do as tucking is a natural instinct :)
Ur Steve Carells brother?
One time I tried coffee and I have regret it because my breath smells like coffee and my mum is gonna get mad cause I made a big mess wish me luck to not get hit from the flip flops
1:05 MOOD 2:11 I think that's worse.. 2:17-2:20 HI SMEAGOL/GOLLUM! 3:17 OH NO! 3:25 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND!? LMFAO! 4:19 WTF!? 4:43-4:44 OMG I ALMOST FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR! 10/10!!! 5:25-5:26 I've never felt more threatened!
I want to see Brandon do a "Google Translate makes Lemon Meringue Pie"
This man has lost all self-control. Doesn't even wipe the milk from his beard.
are you gonna make more eating bug videos??
I bet Maria is going to be THRILLED that you did this one in your house!🤣🤣
The person/ppl who grow coffee beans: STOP! whY You BeAtup my Coffee BeAns?!!!!!! (╥﹏╥)

"The next step just says nope, so, I agree.", 🤣 "Don't worry your calcium covered kitchen..."
I can't stop watching these videos
These thumbnails are life
You should make cupcakes blind folded
How much money do you think Brandon spends per month on a pink drink or any drink from Starbucks? 😂
We have the same last name
Daily dose of Brandon- life is good   Edit: WHAT THE HECK HE DID A FLIP 😂
i have an idea for a google translate video, have your GF with you and do the same thing but have the end translation put into spanish
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FLIP-
Can we mention how he ate a CAROLINA REAPER PEPPER and barely had a freaking reaction like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
That front flip was epic tho
😆
4:42 WEEEEEE

The way he said "Jeff bezos"
You should do Making A Seven Course Meal Blindfolded!
Nobody: My sleep paralysis: 0:36
I seen this TikTok saying Brandon Farris’s yt name was Luke afk
So.... which kitchen is easier to clean?
When are you going to post.
3:23  *when its December 1st:*
You should write a script for a video and translate it
“Grind the coffee beans on the hardest place of the machine, well that’s a little weird to be reading that instead of behind you”😂😂
regarding the merch , does it ship to the UK? if so how to change the currency
i bet your kitchen smells fantastic.
What does walks in the room and does the freaking front flip
I would of cured if he left the link he made up in the description.😂😂😭😭😭😂🤣😂🤣🤣

The thumbnail is absolutely incredible
*something that feels gay and homophobic at the same time* 😭😭😭
I would live in his house just to clean his kitchen))
Dang I'm impressed!!
Why is no one talking about all the people talking about how no one is talking about the front flip.   I’ll clean the mess like a liar. 😁
what happened to leftoversss
Why is nobody talking about that front flip?
I wonder if those are actually Carolina Reapers and he just was like “yeah that’s a good pepper”
Can you please pin this comment I don’t know why I just never been pinned before
THE THUMBNAIL ONGGGGGG

3:23 I'm waiting for this!
Helo
Brandon are u alive, its been 5 days since your last post.
whenever you see a thumbnail like his you know it’s going to be good.
With how slippery his floor tends to seemingly wind up from all the random food items covering it, there was something unnerving about seeing him holding a makeshift axe.
Girls during puberty: "everything hurts and I hate everything" Boys during puberty: 3:23
The explosion of milk got me!!! Lol

This is probably the training video for Starbucks employees.
What happened to cattt and the dog :(
1:05 Minecraft villager????!!!!!
Just a suggestion, but I think you should do a video where you’re Kelly and you just sit behind her portrait and talk. I think it would be a funny video.
*coafee*

What a Waste of food, I’m sorry but it is. But I still do like your work Brandon

Is he ok? Does he need help
i normally watch youtube late at night (considering it's 2:37 rn) But these videos genuinely make me laugh aloud. I've woken my mom approximately 7 times and been grounded because of it approximately 7 times
I cried watching this cause I was just thinking about how you’re still so funny to this day..
3:20 me after seeing things I shouldn’t have seen
BRO YOU HAVE TO DO MORE VIDS WITH YOUR SISTER THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!

Shopping list: Coffee beans, milk, assorted peppers, rice, carmul (I’ll spell it how I want because u pronounce it how u want) sauce, knife, duct tape, plunger, cup, baby bottle… Did u get bandages too? There should always be a first aid kit nearby, and a fire extinguisher.
Brandon: “Knock on wood” * knocks on the crotch cup * Me: brandon- no- 😂
I was super impressed when he did the backflip
Gordon Ramsey could never
2:05
Hi, COVID made my state go into lockdown so ur videos r all that r stopping me from being board so could I please make a reaction video to ur most liked video
How many places do you live?? You've got like 3 different kitchens! Lol do you go to random empty places and make these videos? Lol! Love them!
My childhood nickname was in fact Bean. But it meant coffee bean. Because I eat them. Mmmm so bitter.
I've been speechless ever since the front flip
The perfect thing is that I heard some kind of a trampoline when you did the front flip😅🤣
This is the personality of the people I need in my life. I feel like this is how I act and why people look at me weird when I'm hyper. XD
First ever video I'm seeing of this guy and honestly.... no complaints
4:43 I'm indeed ✨ Impressed ✨
its the pink drinks for me
“You impressed now?”       *hits wall* “ehh”
I want to see him try to stay serious for an entire video
How are you willing to dirty your house just for a video
This is not the standard kitchen....... i geuss someone wasnt happy with the average cooking videos that took place there
You should play granny 3
I watch your videos before I go to bed and I had a dream I met you and you showed me your unfinished house and my family was confused because they had never met you it took place in Florida and we were there for a wedding... what the heck also you remind me of someone who has to leave my life for a while because my sister hurt him ( emotionally) she was using him for his money so it makes me sad but also happy at the same time.
THE MILK
Hey Brandon don't forget about Horror Clown 2😂
gordon ramsay be like: 🤬 tRiGeReD 🤬

I don’t know if you remember but has the next park for horror clown come out yet? If you look back to the last episode of you playing horror clown you said next part of the game would come out in July, and you said you would probably forget so I wonder if you would play it if it’s out. By the way I love your videos it makes me so happy!!
New house
3:17 someone make another this is my come meme out of this please?
*THIS IS MY KINGDOM COME THIS IS MY KINGDOM COME*
MoThEr Of MaRy

I feel like he should react his old videos that would be Hilarious❤️😂
Sry at the start I love it at: 0:24
The fact that he has a Starbucks drink sitting on the counter right next to him and he is not drinking it 😂😂
The cringe🤣l
Thought you weren’t allowed to cook in this kitchen? 😂😂😂
James may at 4:22
The things u do for videos😂
Jesus died on the cross for these things that part got me😂
When you did that for a flip I was like what the heck and I busted down laughing
1:17  This is how McDonald’s be making coffee
Ok good video but why does he looks like giga chad on some video
I like the way all his thumbnails aren’t clickbait.
me- *see's the thumbnail* also me- *this is gonna be a good one*
Bo Burnham vibes.
It looks like Brandon has abs
Idk what was cooler him doing a front flip or the baskitball thing
dallas the pizza guy?
Would be interesting to see Google Translate make spaghetti. 😁
I love how he did the front flip 😂❤️
Animal Crossing sounds.
To save anyone time that's wondering, yes I typed the whole link he said in the beginning into Google and no the website does not exist 😥
Stop- the way the milk just exploded was everything! 😂😂😂
1:20 When you work at a coffee shop and a Karen said you were doing it wrong
"ARE YOU IMPRESSED... aweh."
Me after nnn: 3:23
Let me tell you, this was hard to watch without laughing. It’s 3:30am and I am laying here trying hard not to laugh and wake up my fiancé, my brother and his wife. I choked like 5 times and have tears in my eyes, I survived but my dog was worried to high heaven for about 10 minutes. Keep up the good work, Brandon.
0:00 is the start timestamp

Hi can I have a shout out my birthday is Wednesday and you my favorite YouTuber July 28
122
Me and my daughter have made the cowtail thing a joke and she loves brandon
What I imagine a typical filming session by him to be like: 2 mins of scripting/preparation. 2 hours of filming. 2 days of non-stop cleaning. 2 weeks of trying to find the spots where the weird smells comes from. 2 months of PTSD therapy for his housemates.
I had to stop watching this because you were making me laugh and I just had surgery. I will definitely be watching this at a later date
Brandon is the reason why I’m up at 02:23 in the morning
Fact: The first person to discover that milk is drinkable was very, very thirsty.
I swear this is what my siblings do to the kitchen except they dont clean it up.
Gordon Ramsay say what?
You have issues buddy 😂
that's some milky coffee you have there brandon
I wasn't prepared for such a solid stream of milk to come out of that bottle 🤣 -Ghoul
Everyone is talking about his impressive front flip but no one is talking about the fact that this is a new kitchen and the lack of furniture means they just moved in to this new house. Congrats to them!
The front flip was the only thing he accomplished in this video
😎😎
My mother is ✨2 years older than you✨ brandon lol 😅😂 And could you make a video on you playing ✨ice scream ✨ 🤗
Can you try and solve a Rubik's cube plz
It feels like Google did this on purpose lol
I actually was quite impressed
Milk with hot peppers sound like something my little brother would eat/drink.....     yeah he is sorta wierd
I can’t stop thinking about how much he has to clean up after them. I just that’s so much mess
How many kitchens does this dude have
well this is one way to make coffee
The amount of commitment he needed for this video is incredible. He's done some messy Google Translates, but this one is damn. I find it funny as most do. But I truly hope you get a good laugh out of doing theses to. And that you are not ruining your places to live. Even if one is your office. Getting likes on videos on YouTube isn't worth losing the places you live. Or worth the amount of work it takes to do these. Especially the clean up. Just remember your life comes first, so please dont feel the need that each video having has to be bigger then the last. You are funny either way.
Salutations
How is he coordinated enough  to do a front flip??????? 😅🤣🤣🤣😅😅😆😅🤣🤣😂😂
Nose goes 👃                        👆  For cleaning up the mess
How are you not dead yet I need to no
0.24 You gotta link the website, bro, no one can't find it if it's too specific.
0:57 what if he didnt plug the cord back in lol
Do google translate with autumn
THANK YOU BRADON FOR THIS IM GLAD I ASKED FOR THESE VIDS😂😭✋🏼

Shave you beard
Everyone knows studs can’t make coffee. 🙄
How do you clean? Like, I have seen you pour sand and paint and water in your office. I have seen you just DESTROY your kitchen...I don't know anyone else that would ruin their house and put themselves through pain for views🤣 these videos are hilarious🤣🤣🤣
just from the thumbnail we already know the coffee be tasting amazing
I grounded a couple   They just wouldn't listen   🤣🤣
1:06 he sounds like a villager from Minecraft😂😂
@imbrandonfarris I went to the url and sadly you can't buy domains over 63 characters.... lol DID anyone else try it lololol
I recently had a jaw surgery and I couldn't laugh, or I wasn't supposed to, to be more specific. I'm in pain. Gonna go watch some more Google translate videos...
Fun Fact: Brandon took a month long break between the last cooking episode so he could learn to do a front flip, to impress his dishwasher.  What a Legend.
Y is he so funny idk it's so stupid but so funny 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
I like brandon farris because he's like me he's just so crazy and weird but the jes normal and starts being weird again
I just found out abt yur baby congratulations
THAT FLIP, THO! 😱
I JUST YEETED MY PHONE ACROSS THE ROOM BECAUSE I DID *NOT* KNOW YOU COULD DO A FRONTFLIP
you should do more alexa videos
does anyone else every search up the URL he says at the beginning o f the video even tho you know that nothings going to show up
Well if the dishwasher wasn't impressed ... I was
I would hate cleaning up after Brandon
Brandon finally got that breast milk he's been waiting for all these years
Can you please make longer videos please:)Because I love your videos
Not uh…not what I was expecting when I clicked on a video about making iced coffee…
If you want ice coffe just put ice in the coffe there you go
Impressive front flip. I am indeed impressed.
The 1 video he impressed his entire channel with the flip but everyone knows it took him 38 hours to learn how to flip like that when a normal person it takes 5 minutes
Even the burps are spicy 😶
Imma say that He's kitchen kinda looks like the used be Smosh kitchen
I thoroughly believe that you are Jesus. What can’t you do
I feel bad for how much he has to clean up after his videos, but it’s worth it! Your content is the literal highlight of my day! You are soooo funny!
-face slams coffee beans and peers aggressively- "HM"
i guess this it WhatToBasic

Check out Bones Coffee if you haven't yet! I buy twice a month and am OBSESSED with their flavors!!   I currently have a Spiced Rum, highland grog (butterscotch, my most rebought flavor), salted caramel, smores, and cannoli. (You can get 5 packs of 4oz bags for a "trial" type thing.)  Last time it was* that highland grog, strawberry cheesecake, electric unicorn (like a chocolate fruity cereal,) pumpkin spice, and cinnamon bun. YUM!

I've heard coconut water helps with the burning after eating something spicy.
Starting the video:...  Hyperventilating and cannot breathe until 0:33   Or is that just me??
I was impresso by the flip.
Love the animal crossing sounds in the background.. ty for another fantastic video
"are you impressed now?" UH YES?!
Is it just me or did he get funnier
Hey Brandon, remember about a year ago in one of your 5 minute craft videos when it said to put a latex glove filled with rice on ur baby, you should try that sometime and see if it works.
He must have to clean his house so much
HE HAS RETURNED
Sence when could he frontflip
His front plop looked soooo coool
I went to the website Brandon you didn’t buy it >:0 there is no recipe for iced coffee there
Live these videos. Google translate meals are amazing and so funny, keep up the awsome work

Brandon “I’ve smashed a couple.” Me- “I- WHO DID YOU SMASH *mind* The couple….X-X  (please pin)
“Was your nickname Coffee Beans in College”  No…but my family calls me Bean😶😊
Steps foot onto a college campus and asks someone to call her coffee beans…   IT WAS!!!!  Guys, Brandon talked about me in a video!  #totallynormalthoughts

I saw the thumbnail and went well brandon is the only person in this world who is able to explode and ICED coffee
New house?
I'm just lookin for the stud. Oh there it is! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Do you know smosh? Yeah, apparently that used to be their house
BrandonFerris“ that is spicy coffee”
HELL YEAH I AM IMPRESSED!

I have this type of Feeling that when Brandon was in school, I felt like Brandon was that type of kid who hanged out at Lunch and recess by himself and just do stuff on his own and doesn’t really hangout with anyone.
Can you pin my comment I’ve never been pinned  before
3:23 when you try holding it in during the greatest suck ever

We’re going to ignore the fact that the did a FRONT FLIP.
bro he go "ah!" once and thats it other than "watch out that looks tasty" when he is eating some of the most spicy peppers i know... it took him like 5 minutes to realize the spice
How is it legally allowed for just ONE person to be this damn hilarious?
The animal crossing background music is killing me 😂😂
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

“Jesus’s died on the crops for theses thing” Me: “chokes” 2:26

Oh god 😂 okay so I was watching a craft video before this and I had it on 2x speed cuz I got bored and I turned this on and it was still on 2x and I was so confused why he was moving so fast
0:58 turns out Brandon has been talking to his ring light this whole time.
Is no one going to talk about how this is not his kitchen! 😂 I feel bad for Glorias poor kitchen
He’s the best mess maker
I'm impressed by that flip just so you know

1:21 is the exact moment I lost it 🤣🤣 couldn’t hold it in any longer, I just busted up laughing 😂
"Watch out, they looks look good." **squeak** "AhhHH-"

This isn’t the kitchen he normally destroys, is it??
All I hear is Animal Crossing music, I'm here for it but its triggering lol

"Imma stand behind you, hush up now" Step 1: grind the coffee beans on the hardest place on the machine  Me: Oh no
The YouTube algorithm is doing you WONDERS man!

Your poor wife😂😂😂😂
"wasn't your nickname in college coffee beans?" was an unexpected joke for me because I legit went to college with a dude who started an artisanal coffee roasting company on accident after roasting coffee beans for some friends
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
5 minutes of some dude making a mess.
My favorite step… Nope.  🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s the animal crossing music I’m the background for me lol
Anyone eals go and search up what he said at th beginging

"Hello. Welcome back. See ya later."  Fin.
nope... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the best step there is
I want to invite Brandon to my wedding
Is nobody going to mention that the thumbnail literally looks like an angel or is that just me I think it’s just me
I wonder how many kids watch this infront of their parents and the kid doesnt understand the jokes but the parents know that and are laughing at his jokes ( comment on this if you want to hear some scary or fun facts)
Were u using a baby bottle?
dude this guy straight up cleans his house every time to the point that it looks like nothing ever happened. like even if he burns down his house, next video he will be back in the house like nothing happened

"get wrecked, milk"
Brandon you just flipped

My jaw dropped at the front flip like it never has before OMG
Google translate how to clean up a mess
That’s just comedy 🎭
Anyone else die laughing everytime he spilt something he had a millisecond scene of himself attempting to drink it?
Nobody:   Literally nobody:   Brandon making coffee: I’m going to casually eat a Carolina reaper and a few scorpion peppers while I’m at it and then put it in my coffee
Watching this at 1am wondering how long I can last before busting out laughing and waking everyone up…
Google translate makes a mess
Brandon does outside stuff inside XD

The animal crossing music in the bg 😭😭

Um he ordered a stunt double right ??
The Animal Crossing music is a vibe I was not ready for, but it's perfect.
Bring back - back to basic vlogs with cam.  Pleaseeeee
Do you know how many times I’ve replayed that front flip?  Way too many.....
Yessss I’ve been waiting for another google translate
You should make pancakes 🥞 plz!!!!!!!
Low quality Brandon is literally the best thing ever.
“Watch out it’s tasty”
Get recked milk  he is the one who got recked.
Kinda weird to see ur fav YouTube in your house you was born in
I was at the beach 10 hours ago
Watching this man 😶‍🌫️🍃 is a 1000x funnier 🤣🤣💀💀
2:06 reminded of that white cat 😂😭
4:45..... yeah actually I wasn’t expecting that 🧍🏻‍♀️
This is 100% quality content
2:20 how the shulker noise was made in Minecraft
Is this.... is this another new kitchen???
Him: hehehe... His wife: THIS BIT*H
Do u think you could play granny 3
Not expecting that front flip, I'm impressed
i love that brandon is small enough to do a front flip with a standard 8ft ceiling 😂
69 dislikes nice but why
Was that breast milk, Brandon? lol
Scorpion peppers and Carolina Reapers are hotter than Ghost peppers, my guy. Which was that last pepper, the bhut jolokia.
I don’t know who the 17 are who disliked this video but y’alll suck
You should’ve asked what type of cup before you did the milk into it lol
You need to play the new Barbie granny PLEASE
Noooooo not the nice kitchen!!!!
Can we get the old the old editing back? The new "easing" and captioning text doesn't feel very Brandon farris
I can only imagine Gloria hearing all the commotion downstairs and just shaking her head. Or he's home alone and she has no idea.
All I can think about when watching this is...Maria is going to kill you!  Making a mess in your kitchen!
It is 11:47 pm
Hay ImBrandonFarris you want to here a math joke?     Notice me, Sin π
Do you want ants? this is how you get ants
You kept your ability to front flip secret?!?!
Where is he at
I just came home from the hospital because I had a panic attack but this made me feel better
Lol he better give the coffee he made to his neighbor it was one of the steps xD
My dog loves watching you.😂 me and my dog were laying in bed and I sat my phone in front of him and he just watched you.
What does his tattoo say?
Step one: cover your kitchen in napkins....
Ok so I read the title and I was like oh that sounds nice and then I look at the photo and it’s an explosion like google translate how?  Never mind I found out how
Gotta appreciate the og animal crossing music
Judging by the thumbnail I can tell that there’s going to be “this is my kingdom come” Memes.
Is this a new kitchen? It’s been a minute since I’ve been here😅
Watch 3:20 through 3:25 at playback speed .25
Ahh yes the quintessential coffee ingredient, carolina reaper...
And when the milk exploded after that you were trying to drink it but it was it was on the table
IM DIEYING
That one when you’re eating the umm 🤔 oh yeah peppers it was so funny and when the milk exploded that was way funnier
Always on point BF!  😀😀😀
I love you videos and watching you always kills me up and if you never started YouTube I can never believe I would make it to today
Can you tell me how you’re the funniest person on the world please how do you do that?
I CANT WITH THESE VIDEOS To everyone: Jesus loves you so so much and he died so we can be forgiven and go to Heaven with God if you accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, have a great day!
*forcefully bangs coffee grounds and makes a mess*  Brandon :gotta go fast !
Not gonna lie, that flip 100% impressed me
DO MORE OF THESE   like if u agree
BACKFLIP
Get your elbow out of the bowl!
yay another one!
uhhhhh where are you? that's not what your kitchen normally looks like
I'm going to be awful disappointed if I take the 2 hours to type in that website and find nothing! 😂😂
Hey Brandon just got back from Afghanistan and literally got on YouTube and well the first video that popped up was this well worth it 😂
Isn't that the inlaws house
I hope he does more cooking videos where it's legit. I like to see him try new things and surprise people with them.
Anyone else super surprised by the front flip 😂🙋🏻‍♀️
Can you do more life hack videos
You should make a video about after you finish recording a video and the clean up process.... I don't know if that sounds cool or not lol
LOL!!!!
I always get so confused when he is in a different house. Like WHICH ONE IS YOURS😂
pretty sure the dishwasher is impressed coz I am
His videos are hilarious 😆😆😆😂😂🤣
All the time he isn’t recording he is probably cleaning
When you watch his vids make sure to pause them when your drinking something……………..oof
THE FLIP WAS AMAZING!!!
Did he just eat a Carolina Reaper
i’m tempted to look up the website at the beginning
In his actual kitchen? This is not the kitchen he usually uses. Does Maria Gloria know?
Google Translate should make you a Pink Drink 🤣
I cannot express how happy this man makes me feel 😂😂😂
Try making your pinky drinky Starbucks drink blindfolded
Could anyone please tell me what does his tattoo say? It bugs me so much 😅
I love your content
I feel sorry for the amount of cleanup he has to do
you can't ground a couple the only way you can ground another person's child if it's actually your own child so is this some sort of Alabama joke
Not this being the earliest I’ve ever been 💀
Why does he always changes kitchen !?
You are so funny I love all your videos
4:45 WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW AMAZED I AM! 0o0 (literally isnt a joke i didnt know u could do that...
Brandon doing a front flip us being impressed then walk in to a wall
he totally used gloria's milk for that one bit lol
How do you clean these 😭🤣
What is your skin-care routine, your skin is fucking beautiful and smooth
There’s no one talking about that he casually eat a Carolina reaper
did you move....you got a new kitchen
Brandon every single time you get something new you always end up breaking it.. BUT HEY WHATEVER!! I LOVE THE CONTENT YOU MAKE OUT OF IT
Never ever drink or eat anything and try to watch a Brandon farris video i made that mistake and now I'm covered in pepsi lol was having a bad day today crying all day then i saw this and couldn't stop laughing. Ty Brandon you're the best. My friend told me about your channel a few months ago and I've been subscribed ever since. You're hilarious. Ty for cheering me up. I shared this video with a friend whos going through alot right now and the last video of brandons i shared with her she txted me saying omg I'm laughing so hard at work people are staring at me. She thought it was hilarious. Keep up the good work.
Have you moved!?!?! Milk everywhere? Oh Lord, Gloria is going to kill you. You are probably already dead. Who posted this?
4:43 is impressive
Hi
Ok how many apartments/houses do he and Gloria have??? Lmao
Brandon... how many times do medical professionals have to tell you not to eat spicy foods. I do not envy your GI track right now. 😖
All I saw was the thumbnail and 😳
" i have Cockroaches" .... lets do more Google Translate!!
Who just randomly found this guy one day and is now in an endless loop of watching his really enjoyable videos?      Edit: I wouldn’t recommend going to the reply section, unless you want to see a lot of hate being thrown around. Thank you.
Hi
That flip tho 😲😲
Only Brandon could find a way to turn an iced coffee recipe into a hot pepper challenge. Bravo sir.
“Jesus died on the cross for these things?” 😂
I have no words haha
I’m impressed wow😂😂😂😂
i am impressed and i have washed many dishes, you have therefore succeeded in impressing the dishwasher
dishwasher:DO A FLIP brandon: does a front flip "YOU IMPRESDSED NOW?!"
YOU CANT JUST THROW IN A FLIP OUT OF NOWHERE 😱😱😱😱
what showed up on my feed and why did I watch it😂😂😂😂😂
“Welcome back... see you later.” 😌
Anyone else wonder what it looks like behind the scenes while cleaning up these messes 😆
The innuendos are killing me💀💀
I wanna see a video of him cleaning up the kitchen
Physical humor never ceases to make me laugh 😂
Whoever cleans up after Brandon deserves a raise.
I am dying laughing
HAHAHAAHAHAHA
A police car drove by with sirens right as he ripped the tape off and turned around... It took me a few seconds too long to realize the sirens weren't in the video... It all worked together so well 😂
Was that a James May reference in a Brandon Farris video...I can die in peace.
"The next step says nope... so I agree." That cracked me up!
ooh I like the new kitchen
how many kitchens you got my guy
If grounding doesn’t work, try a time out facing the wall. Make sure it’s a boring wall though.  Up to you to decide which side of the bean is the face.  Is the side with the crack a smile, or a butt? 🤷🏻‍♀️
Fffygyjgfghgf
Missed opportunity to play the Roost instead. Glad that google translate got another video.
"Even the burps are spicy 😃"  I died 😭
OMG HE CAN FLIP WOWOWOWWOW
"I grounded a couple, they just wouldn't listen" 😭😭
HOW MANY KITCHENS DOES THUS DUDE HAVE!? OMG HES THE KITCHEN GOD!
Just a thought to brandon who just ate super spicy peppers only for our own fun
That front flip was lowkey impressive asf
That flip though 🔥
When u
Brandon is the type of guy you just want to be friends with.
We need "watch out they look good" merch   Who agrees
I’ve watched you for so long and your so funny and person space my guy hahahahaha
Every time I have a bad day I just got to watch your videos it makes me feel better😁
he makes places dirty for our entertainment
Anyone else notice the increasing shake in his hand the more peppers he ate?! 😂  "Jesus died on the cross for These Things!?!" 🥵
Is no one gonna talk about THE FLIP HE DID!
DIFFERENT KITCHEN.
You included James may, I love this man-
Yeah what  has happened to this kitchen you haven't used it in like a year
4:50 You work out?   I dont mean that in a weird way…..im just gonna go……
BRO BRO, DO A FLIP 😀😀
I am deeply impressed at the flip you did there.
“ I turned you off..... I should’ve stayed behind you” 💀💀
I don't know if you have answered this question before but if you don't mind me asking. What does you tattoo say?
That flip tho!!!
James May saying "cheese"!!! This is why I love you Brandon! 🤣🤣🤣
I dare you to make a pizza blindfolded
I think I died
Try the gouts pepper
Ok so let’s go over the things Brandon is good at singing, playing instruments,comedy,basketball,rapping,gaming,and apparently now gymnastics!
Brandon "(dose  front flip) you impressed now(walks into Wall)ow" Me"wow I'm intimidated ahhhhh "
WHAT IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT FRONT FLIP!!!??

This is for sure the best serie on youtube!
I love this dude.
It seems as though almost every task he tries to do ends in an explosion and a huge mess
Listen.... this isn't the right apartment for this video ...
Where is he? This isn’t the apartment kitchen. Feeling confused 🤔
I use Advent bottle for my bubba as well!
On no guys. The old kitchen is WWAAAYYYY too bad for even this video
WAIT A MINUTE! Is anyone else noticing he is in a completely different kitchen? Did they move or? I thought they moved awhile ago...
Will SOMEONE please help me with what the "2%" is? Apparently I missed it & let it drive me crazy when I see something & I should know but missed it. I thought the  2% stuff would be available merch. I love Farris so much. I wish I was that genius but I genuinely believe men are inherently funnier than women. I'm not sure what it is but something about it just if women did the exact same things say like Farris does, I don't think it would be near as funny.
Front flip what!?  Respect my guy.
4:42 How. Is this person so good at so much random crap.
What is this the 4th kitchen he's destroyed doing these videos?
Did you legit bite into a carolina reaper and not die?? I'm amazed!
The Animal Crossing music! 🤣
New house?????!!!!!
ayeee lets gooooooo another google translate vid!!!! definitely did not watch all of them in one night like a month ago... hopefully theres more coming out soom, but for now kep up the amazing work man. your amazing!!!
Brandon: don’t make it weird Also Brandon  *pours warm milk into a ^cough cough^ cup*
That front flip was actually pretty impressive 😂
Gloria is going to KILL him when she sees what he did to the kitchen! 😂
That flip THOO
The way his whole kitchen is a mess 💀 😭
when you fall asleep on your couch and you wake up to "Personal space my guy" You know your fully awake or your have slipped into a coma.
The animal crossing background tune made me enjoy this more
Minecraft villagers be like: 1:03
How many kitchens do you have!?😂😂😂
James May caught me so off guard omfg
You should give it to your girlfriend
Anyone know what his tattoo says?
I went to that website and was disappointed he didnt actually buy it
When could he front flip?!🤯
That is my pet
brandon: pain sounds also brandon: "Here comes the PaiN"  me: automatically starts listening to slipknot in my head
Brandon can do GyMNAStIcs?!?!? Good for you man
Yes I'm impressed😍
Never in the time that I’ve watched Brandon did I think he could do a front flip 😂 I was deeply impressed
thank god he didn't use actual fireworks
I dont think that knock on wood was an intentional joke but im glad my dirty mind caught it cause it was hilarious
i was genuinely surprised by that front-flip :0
4:42 was awesome 👏 the rest was hilarious 😂
Brandon gives me youth pastor vibes
That has got to be the plainest kitchen/living room ever!! There's literally nothing there!
What's his tattoo say??
That flip was awesome duuuuude!
I accidentally skipped 4 minutes in and Brandon's shirtless. How did this escalate so fast?! Its a 5 minute video!! XD
This man is one of the funniest people ever
I'm impressed the fan didn't come down
He puts so much work into these
The first Brandon video I ever watched was him trying to learn to knit. He really has come a long way. Don't really know how we got from that to this... But eh, it's super entertaining. 👍 Keep it up, you funky little ginger! ❤️
"personal space my guy"   -imbrandonfarris
Clicked on it so fast I nearly knocked my computer over.
DID YOU SERIOUSLY BITE A RAW CAROLINA REAPER PEPPER?! OMG!
brandon better be paying his cleaning lady BIG bucks
100% betting the kitchen is still a mess lol
the James May ‘cheese’ gave me a chuckle
My son says, “Make macaroni and cheese with Google translate 🤣”
😂😂💀😂💀😂😂💀 Was excited he was eating something spicy/but know it messes up his stomach😫...lawd hope they baby wasnt sleep all that noise &that mess.....i know Gloria is extra excited about new kanye!!
How many buildings does this guy own 😂
That front flip actually really impressed me
we just gonna skip past the fact that he DID A FRONTFLIP
Are we gonna ignore his kitchen or have i watched too many old vids of his
Why has your kitchen changed
4:44 ya I'm impressed now
Brandon: Here comes the pain Me: 🎵 doo doo doo doo 🎵
Start/stopping the video to read the writing on your tattoo is mighty tricky. Let's try slow-mo.
SOOOOO funny!!!! On a side note, can you please just put a shirt on, my guy?
I feel like he turned into a villager when he went hmmm
THE THINGS HE DOES IN THIS VIDEO.  ITS THE PEPPERS FOR ME
brandon has been working out. i can tell
welll
I like how every time he makes a Google translate video he's in a different place lol
idk why i feel like he moved of he's in a new kitchen but i think he moved its just a diffrent kitchen
What's that tatoo say on your shoulder?? Care we dist
I saw the hat backwards and I thought it was an old video I was so surprised this was posted 4 hours ago🤣💜
Lol
The noise the duck tape made while breaking killed me. Still currently laughing my head off as I rewatch it 🤣🤣🤣
Did you move
If the dishwasher is still unimpressed with his casual outta no where front flip, at the very least I am impressed so there's that...
Part of the website was sad boi 🙃
I bet Brandon won’t like it reply to this comment
me when your mom: 3:22
I feel sorry for the people who clean you house
Lmao Brandon you kill me
3:23 I think you missed...
Minecraft villagers be like 1:05
I'm not a fan of you cause I find it disturbing to worship a person. I do think your cool and if you weren't famous I would try to be a internet friend to you 😉  but ya ppl who worship actors and online people just seems weird and a little unsettling
Had to rewind when I saw James May 😂
I laughed too hard at all though jokes 😂
I don’t know about the dishwasher but I’m impressed 😂
Are we not gonna talk about he did A front flip yet I'm A gymnast and I'm scared of that ESPECIALLY ON THE FLOOR
How many kitchens does Brandon have*cough*(/destroy)?
I think everyone's I impressed by the front flip
bruh that flip was amazing
“Are you impressed?” Um, yes! He can do a freaking front flip!
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FRONT FLIP
Gloria is going to kill you
I’m watching this while cooking knowing I’m better then you at it
i didbt know you could do afront flip whaaaaaaat
Maria is going to kill you for messing up the real houae
How long does it take you to clean up?😂
How many kitchens do you have
So sense when could you do a front tuck?
The animal crossing music in the background makes the video
Why is this liked by the creator?
Are we gonna ignore the city folk music—
*"This is my kingdom c o m e, this is my kingdom c o m e"*
That front flip, tho.
Me
4:35 I am actually very impressed I did not see that coming
Calcium covered kitchen🤣🤣
That flip it was impeccable sir 👍 10/10
When are u gonna make another resident evil video
Excuse me? This dude ate a Habanero, a Scorpion pepper, and a Carolina Reaper and didn't have to go to the hospital?
“Mmm tastes like the ground”
I'm gonna go Google what an ulcer feels like
heyyyy Brandon i love you so much my little brother and I never miss a video
Did he actually buy that domain?
this was the funniest video i’ve watched in a LONG time
Ice coffee ad at the beginning of the video of making iced coffee 🤣🤣🤣
Nice to see Captain Slow make an appearance! 🤣🤣🤣
Brandon tapping the machine: “I’m just looking for a stud.” Taps his arm: Oh, there it is!”  Flawless execution of one of the oldest Dad Jokes
Wow I hate to clean that mess
"I turned you off...should have stayed behind you." Immediately busted out laughing! 🤣🤣lmao
I dont know why wouled you do that there is an easer way to mavke ice coffe
everyone talking bout who knows what me: how in the sharp cheddar cheese with the scorpion bell peppers did he do a front flip?
His neighbors must be so confused.
He even knows how to use a molcajete Is there something this man can't do?
I actually love peppers and those peppers looks bussin
🧜🏼‍♂️
goodbye to Brandon bowels, they're screaming why just why! you promised no more
what did I stumble upon? what even is this mans
A front flip is an everyday thing for me and a back flip when I see Urr face lol.           Hope u know I'm joking👍
Does anyone know what his shoulder tattoo says!! It’s really bugging me as I want to know 😂
Best way to end a Wednesday workday...with Brandon ruining his kitchen and mouth for us!!
I feel so bad for whoever is cleaning the kitchen I'm so sorry for you 😬
Why is he all of a sudden be in a different kitchen????
I will stick to the orders instead☠️
3:23 Boys on December 1st.
😂🤣😂
4:42 oh my God, Brandon?????
James may making an appearance.... love this
You know it’s gonna be a good video when there is an explosion in the thumbnail      Or tbh yk it’ll be a good video when Brandon is in the thumbnail
Anyone know what his tattoo says?
I was pretty impressed cause i had to rewind the video to see that sick back flip  I know he's capable of causing chaos but That?? My upmost respect
I love his cooking videos sm😭
Best Google translate in a while!!! Hope those peppers didn't cause too much trouble later in! 🌶️
cheese
Love the animal crossing music
Digging that animal crossing music in the background! So glad to see another google translate finally! That wheeeeeeze laugh xD
Brandon: hello  Me: hi 😄
I lost count of the innuendos in this video
Oh great another kitchen to ruin ✨
Did I just spend 10 minutes searching up that link to see if you really bought it?    *yes, yes I did*
I don't know if dishwasher is impressed, but I am
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SLOWMO THE DUCKTAPE RIP 🙏 THOSE NIPS MOOOOOVED 😂
Google translate makes peanutbutter and jelly sandwich
What does your tattoo say on your shoulder? I’ve been trying to work it out for months.
Ohhh my gosh everything in this is gold 😂💜
You are hilarious
Pin this just because
So why did James May sneak in? Anyone? Help …? What have I missed!? Yeah the forward flip was amazing but …. James May!
I love that this was uploaded while I was at the Starbucks drive thru lmao
U should make chocolate chip cookies nextttttttt🍪
"HErE COmeS ThE PaIN"
I didn't even notice you were shirtless until the video ended
Brandon you forget to share your coffee with us. 🥲
I loved this video 🤚😂✨
While Brandon was eating very spicy peppers and Dying of spicyness I  Died of laughter And that was a good flip  I can only do that On a bar
I feel like he would be the funniest comedian to live-
I see Brandon is going back to spicy stuff!
You know it's serious when making coffee includes making a milk fountain
Brandon, your chaotic energy is precisely what the doctor ordered
"hm EvEn the Burps ARe sPiCY"
Not surprised ONLY 28 PEOPLE DISLIKED LIKE HES TO GOODDD
The puns get me every time
Yes yes actually color me impressed ok love you bye

Brandon... Is that your new place you're making a mess in??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💜💜💜💜💜💜
He’s like slimecicle unexpectedly buff and athletic
HE MOVED AGAIN!did I like miss a video orr what?
I honestly feel like you should add the original steps aswell as the translated steps. I'm really interested in where these came from😂
Yes. Yes indeed I am very impressed.
Please do google translate makes a baked Alaska  The best part is it involves *fire*
YASS queen
That front flip thoug
Does no one realize how hard a front flip is and how much AIR HE GOT DAMN
2 HOURS AGO OMG IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN
You know when you ate the peppers i was screaming EAT BRED it helps
Best quote ever! "Jesus died on the cross for this. " LMAO.  The real question I have is how mad Gloria is going to be at the mess?  I will keep my fingers crossed for you.  I really hope she doesn't chancla you.
The Laugh he does after a dad joke 😂
Can we just say good backflip
4:43 the dishwasher might not have been impressed but I sure was
LOL when i watch this my mug fall down
it's scary that he can do a front flip he's already so chaotic he doesn't need to be extremely agile with it
amazing
That red mark that the duct tape made tho. hahahaha
Poor Britta 😂❤️
OH. MY. GLOB. Brandon you have outdone yourself. I’m one minute in and I’m already wheezing on the kitchen floor! This made my entire day. Please never stop. 😂🥺🤍💜
Yay Brandon upload!!
new home ?
Wow flip
The frontflip tho??
Hi people
What's his tattoo say?
i looked up the website... IP address not found... im sad
4:22 James May cameo level LEGENDARY
Omg you've made my day ever since I found your YouTube
Helkp im ccvant sperll
Brandon should do 5 minute crafts through Google translate 😏
Do a flip!
I got an ad for Keurig before this video. Guess they want to show how to make coffee, without Google translate. 😂
ello
3:23 must i say anything more?
Did no one notice the avent "cup" he used? It is for breastmilk 🤣🤣
Are we going to ignore 4:41 or what 🤷🏼‍♂️
Personal space my guy
Okay so I haven't watched the video yet buy my actual mental state is "okay it's iced coffee I don't think there's a lot to put in that how bad can it go?" Now you know, I'll uptade you later!    Very bad he used rice.
Top of the morning coffee wants to know your location
The unknown conquers all
Does Gloria know what you did to her kitchen? 😂🤣😂 Thank heavens for Bee 🐝 😂💜💜
Brandon’s house probably smells like coffee right now
I'm just thinking how Maria doesn't kill him for the messes
I don't know if you care but I actually prefer your videos without the background music; music gets in the way of your comedic genius
So I have been cursed. You know that voice in your head that you talk to/hear. For the past 4 days, I have only heard the “Brandon Farris” voice in my head and I am scared.
That front flip though 🤩
The thumbnail is amazing
The minute I saw the title I said oh no
2:40 *“eVeN tHE bUrPS ARe SpiCey~”*
Hi can you please reply I would cry
4:42 yes I am impressed I want a video on flips now :)
This must be HowToBasic
さまををひ
Are you guys moving out of your new house? There is no furniture in the living room.
yeyyy, he added background music.
How do you clean your house????? Even I hate spilling some milk but here you are lol
Love the videos bro keep up the good work
that frontflip was amazing 10/10
Man almost killed his mouth spice
...That front flip tho-  Like, I can't do that! So I'm impressed!  Also, Love the vid! O(∩_∩)O
I’m dying of laughter watching this vid OMG 😂😂😂😂
My first thought was, oh no he's doing this in his actual house Gloria is going to kill him 🤣
3:23 this is my kindom come
I would LOVE to see a video of you cleaning the "mess" you make whenever you do these videos 😂😂
Meanwhile I was taking turns texting the alphabet with my friend...
I Love These Videos❤️🥰       They’re Funny
Just imagine you sleeping he him busting into your room with the plunger with the knife on it
3:19 This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come-  3:24 WHEN YOU FEEL MY HEAT--
Why did I choke when he broke the tape with his arms I-
He ate 5 peppers and never learned anything
Damn boi has got hops . He stuck that landing so good
Why make ice coffee if you only drink pink drinks
Oh my guckin fod i literally got an ice coffee ad before the video!
the animal crossing music in the background really makes this video XD
You whistled and my dogs literally went crazy barking 😆
That flip was CG right? Had to have been CG. I don't see Brandon being that coordinated. If it wasn't holy S**t he just did a front flip!
•
Does he has health insurance? Where is the closest hospital? Poor guy.
Have fun cleaning brandon🤣🤣
I swear this is the messiest google translate😂😂lol
THE MILK 😂 lmao
Hi I miss this series
I just love how he destroys his kitchen for us but then magically cleans his kitchen when he's done with the video
Yay he posted this in hour ago my second fastest one
Ah you have upgraded to destroying a different kitchen than your work apartment.
brandon is literally howtobasic's brother
i am actually, genuinely, impressed LOL
My brain at 2 am 1:21
That flip! I had to pause the video, digest what I just saw, rewind and watch the flip again, pause again, and digest a second time!
You should make google translate Egg Fried Rice and let Uncle Roger review it 😆
New home, did you get kick out of the parts or just tried of pizzas being delivered?
Do you think he cleans after all these or dose he hire a maid or something 🤔

1:05 I am DECEASED LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂
Yayayyyyy Brandon!!!!! I missed you man!
You know when Brandon posts a google translate vid it’s gonna be a good day
Get recked  milk Milk:I shall use my super weapon against u  Think its going to explode but decides take lid off knowing what might happen Milk:does the exact opposite of what Brandon thinks is going to happen
😭😭😭😭
“and then i inhale your exhale and then you stop talking to me for some reason” 😂
3:23 *"This is my kingdom come"*    Sorry I just had to
This is not an ASMR video...
love this series makes my laugh so much
yes
The intros are still poppin off
I love how aggressive he is!😂😂😂
Ummmm who does clean your kitchen??? If I came to that...NGL I'd worry.
3:23 gotta be my favourite part
I wouldn’t ever want to get into a fight with you. You have a particular stare, the death stare I call it. I am immediately hypnotized, frozen, I feel the power! Who am I kidding, I am no match for that.  Great job. This week just went from Extraordinary to Stellar!!
Just me or does anyone else now want iced coffee??😂
Unknown coordination level!!  Flawlessly flies through air doing a front flip.. When on solid ground… walks into wall.. 😂
Me sad:  Brandon: *makes video* Me: ✨serotonin✨
By looking at the photo on the video I think it went wrong and went everwhere
The thumbnail is 🤌🏻
Holy shit the part with get rekt milk really got me😂
It was the sharp cheese jokes that got me 😂🤣😂
Brandon: "Why do I have cockroaches?"  Also him:
Epok🥶👌 !!!!1!!1!
Brandon always makes me laugh, I see him as my father figure becuase my father isnt the best Daily brandon, maybe a binge, is what I need to laugh
Waiting for Maria Gloria to comment… 🤔😆😅
I'm just......so confused
Ok totally off subject but did he move lol
Who is Kelly? I always thought that Kelly was his wife/fiancé/girlfriend but Gloria is his fiancé/girlfriend. So… WHO IS KELLY???
*Brandon does front flip* "YOU IMPRESSED NOW?" me: actually I am I really impressed didn't know you could do that my guy lol
These google translates are giving me howtobasic vibes🤣
WATCH OUT THESE ARE TASTY
I could watch these all day!! Lmao 🤣🤣🤣
I have watched all of these like 1 million times. LMAO =)
Brandon probably moved house because he couldn't get rid of all that glitter
The thumbnail looks like Brandon is unleashing his ultimate power
Oh god is that his new home?
yess i missed this series
ITS THE OLD KITCHENNNNN WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I loved the backflip it was amazing lolz♡♡♡
1:03 why ja this so funny to me xD
Hey brandon! Nice beard❤️  Also I've been trying to contact you about your Car's extended warranty... Pls respond
I was very impressed of the back flip and then lmao when he walked into the wall 😂😂😂
Finally a video with JUST Brandon’s bumper!!! Lol
This was one hour agoooo
Brandon just gets better and better.
Why does Brandon get so aggressive and touching with everything and then it just turns weird in a good way
Whenever I play anything on YouTube my dad never pays attention but when I put on one of Brandon's videos it's the only time he watches
I love your videos even though you "Do not produce laughter"
OMGGG THAT MAN CAN FLIP YUH FET IN TO ITTT
I could not stop laughing through this entire video. It was freaking hilarious.
gonna take a moment to appreciate his nice abs like who else noticed?
New best video!
Gloria is gonna be pissed...
“EvEn thE bUrbs ArE spIcy”😩💔
If I was the washer then I am very Impressed
I’ve been WAITING FOR THIS
I love how he causully ate a carolina reaper "Watch out it looks good" Lol
You know your coffee making game is serious when you bust out the mortar and pestle, while eating the hottest peppers available.
My nickname actually WAS at one point coffee bean!!
What does his tattoo say?
Does your apartment have 2 kitchens? Because sometimes you're in this kitchen and sometimes in the other lol I'm confused
But that front  flip tho
Why would Maria ever let you do this in the house omg. You ceiling is going to smell like milk forever.
Love you Brandon
Hey  I love ur vids so much I watch u when I’m bored and it’s funny
"My girlfriend loves coffey more than me,"
724th
Brandon we need the five minute craft's backkk
Am I the only one to realize you have abs
First
When he smacked the coffee bean bag against the coffee maker… I laughed and screamed with anger at the same time. 😂😂😂
This guy has Bobby dukes energy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love this video
Hi

I'm 50 minutes late but I love your vids last night I choked on my tea laughing at your vids almost died
My man making his house messy for content 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣

I haven’t watched the video yet but idc how you make iced coffee. How does it explode?!
Pin this if you love your gf
Color me impressed with that flip!
Hi
Still trying to figure out what his darn tattoo says!😂 All I know is that it starts with "dare we"
ay up i hear that animal crossing music
i sometimes feel bad for your editor sometimes i wish i was ur editor just to see what didnt make the cut
The best thumbnail ever
Huh there really is nothing on that link
at 4:20 Brandon got cultured
BRANDOOOOON  hii you make good content so keep it up buddy but dont over work yourself either
I need to make a pizza with ETS today at 7/21/21 at 4:00 pm and I will be thinking of you the entire time Brandon
How long does it take you to clean everything? 🤣
Anyone else notice the animal crossing music over the video 😂🙌🏻😃
Google translate makes Pretzels
Oh my God WHY do you do this to yourself?!
This man makes me laugh anytime I'm sad
i feel bad for him just imagine all the cleaning
bro i looked up the ip address and nothing came up. HOW DARE YOU LIE!!! JEAR DESUS
Brandon:*starts staring at me* Me:”what-…” *starts smacking beans against coffee machine *1:21
Does anyone else notice the old wii animal crossing music in the background?
Are you still renovating the bathroom
Brandon is the person that would do anything for someone
His poor house
I enjoyed the ACCF background music
The hat turn again!! Yes!😂
And finally we get to see the whole tattoo....love it by the way.  :)  Been missing your google translate videos...this poor kitchen...lol.
I love the calming animal crossing music in the background
to the 10 people who disliked, don't get funny when you see it
yo is that a new kitchen or am i dumb
Love his humour!
When I saw the thumbnail I was like *"yep this is gonna be chaotic"*
Was anyone else very concerned when the directions called for fireworks? Lol
He does comedy, shreds a mean guitar, can sing and now gymnastics... Duuuuude!! He is Brandon Farris, buy his merch. Or send Brandon more Bob Ross cut-outs.
Wait, He’s carrying  _B E A N S_ ?
What does your tattoo say?
How in Brandon Farris life is his house still standing😂💀
*smacks beans in face* Brandon:HHMM Me:what in the villager is this
Jesus died on the cross for these things. LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4:42- yes, yes I am impressed 😂
Yes. Yes I am impressed.
The amount of chaos is something else...
hid "failed stunt actor" vibe is so strong for some reason
this is like 15 videos in one and i love it. thanks brandon
4:41 I- yes I am impressed Good job
This is how I'd live my life if I wasn't poor, and didn't have any consequences to my actions
Man I love your videos
I honestly could watch him for hours.I love this channel
"Imma stand behind you, hush up now" Step 1: grind the coffee beans on the hardest place on the machine  Me: *Oh no*
@jameshoffmann should watch this :-)
I love you videos they’re so funny
This was posted right now in my country
U kind of sound like Ned Flanders
This was a roller coaster. Did you at least reward yourself with a real coffee afterwards? 😂
"Oops I turned you off, I should have stayed behind you" I just choked on my lunch
We can all admit... we all love this guy.
"Jeff Bezos said that was hot 🔥" 😂
Love this series sooooo much definitely my favourite 🤩
This was meant to be iced coffee .. Where'd the peppers come form 😭😂
Im  your surprised oven is not broke
No one going to talk about 4:40?
What the hell did I find this
3:45 you look like Shane Dawson’s cat
- Netflix: Are you still watching?  - Someone’s daughter: 3:23
Hey there, Love watching your videos but when are you gonna hop on the twitch again there buddy?lol you never finished the village game and I'm dying to see how it ends, I dont want to play it myself tho lol I get creeped out to easily
im so sorry that happend but this video was funny lol
Lmao, these types of videos are so funny
Did anyone else just search up the website he said in the beginning of the video…    Just me?
His Girlfriend must love the messes he makes
Can’t believe MG let him do this in there new house
He really does plan the way that will make the most of a mess, doesn't he? lol
Not even kidding when I say that you are the only content creator that makes me belly laugh out loud. Every. Single. Video. THANK YOU!! ☺️🖤
“Even the burps are spicy 🌶 ”
kinda looked a strange type of boba tea at the end
Im suprised he survived from all of this😄😊♥
When brandons hacks are better than 5 minute crafts
I want coffee now
Ahh! I missed Google translate!
Yes Brandon is back!
4:00am in Adelaide Australia. I should be asleep but here I am still up watching Brandon's latest video lol
" don't worry your calcium covered kitchen I made I play list" I'm dead😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂
Yes I’m impressed
How the hell did you do that flip
**brandon breaks duct tape** brandon: I AM BUILT DIFFERENT
Ohh you mentioned 2 story house...did the landlord finally kick you out of the apartment? I mean, that purple glitter bomb stunt was pretty intense.
I have never been this early to a video and I'm not mad. This was fun to wake up to 😂
Plz make more videos with autumn🤟🏻
Brandon: * dose backflip* you impressed now… Me: that was pretty impressive  Brandon: * runs into wall* Me: *laughs* that was impressive to…* dying of laughter*
The thumbnail tells me this will be a good video
Hi.     I said hi.      Why aren’t u replying        REPLY ALREADY!
Finally 😂😂👏✊ google translate
I feel so bad for him
Finally I'm kinda sorta early
Looking at when this released and looking at my coffee next to me, you made your coffee at the same time as me :0
Okay but why is his front flip better than my sense of humor
Brandon attacks coffee machine with coffee beans (runs away) It was a hit and run "Jesus die on the cross for these?"😂😂
Half way through the video I forgot what was being made, and I never figured it out until the very end of the video.
Who's house is this? They don't live together?
Are we just gonna gloss over the fact that he did a front flip
You know what Google Translate told me:  Brandon posted a video on the website What video you ask? Happy Wheels
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
Since when does Brandon know how to do a front flip 😭💀
Yaaaaaas Its going to be a great daaaaaay !!!! Thank you for the video Brandon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💜💙💚
Brandon: hey babe do u mind if I use your kitchen?  Gloria: sure but why?  Brandon: oh I flooded mine
King of intros
Wow! That flip was amazing!
everyday i watch u im laghting
How many kitchenz does he have?
I love iced coffee thank you for the recipe I wrote it down as you were telling me I'm going to try this recipe and I bet is as good as yours you have a great day thank you again LOL LOL LOL
Early can I get a like ❤️
I’m surprised you’re still alive
He will always be my favorite YouTuber.
how much cleaning does this guy need to do-
“I LOVE pepper”- Brandon Farris Is gonna be written on his gravestone
Great video
Brandon just casually does a front flip.
Lmao Your my fave
4:40 yes actually I am
we need an "after filming clean up" video lmao
Make cheesecake blindfolded
I was the 500th comment lol
Jesus died on the cross for these things 😂
*beats coffee machine to death*            Brandon: coffees ready! 😂
it’s like he was staring into my soul when he was grinding the coffee beans 😀
20m
Was worried when Google translate mentions an axe. Concern grows intently seeing Brandon with a kitchen knife taped to a plunger.
Seeing Brandon doing a front flip is the last thing I would’ve expected
*dies* ohmygodthatsagoodpepper
The thumbnail gives me so hope for this going perfectly
Brandon: *pouring milk in his cup* Me: *laughing so hard I couldn't breathe!*  Watching your videos is the solution to some many problems. Thank you so much for doing these. You are an incredible person.
I would invite Brandon to my birthday as the cook and entertainer
Y'all he just did a front flip and there are 0 comments about it!!
The word I kept repeated throughout the whole video was "Brandon no" or "STOP EATING THE PEPERS" lmao this video just made my day. thank you Brandon. deeply appreciated.
I love his videos
top 1000
The level of ✨comedy✨ 👌🤌
Ooooh my, just standing there chewing on all those peppers hurt ME! 😫🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️💜 MUCH love, RIP Brandon's toilet...
I feel bad for his wife tbh
.sadboi   Cuz he haz to renovate the bathroom 😂
I laughed until a little bit of pee came out
Dam I've missed ur google translate videos. Plz do more need a good laugh right now 😂😂😂❤️❤️
The seeds hold the capsaicin so if you remove those you keep the flavor without all of that spice.
Is no one going to talk about that fact he just did a front flip
Lmfao You are so damn funny. I could watch you all day long. Keep the funny coming. We love you in Ohio ❤️
How is your house still alive?
That’s funny
3:36 IS THERE EVEN ANY LEFT??
468th
we all agree his house is a god because of how long it’s lasted and the camera as well.
Brandon: *Does a flawless backflip to entertain le dishwasher* Are you not entertained?! Dishwasher: Eh. I've seen better.
He makes me laugh so hard I can’t breathe 😝🥺🤚
If Brandon opened a coffee shop: It would be called *Dare we disturb the coffee beans*. The exit door would read *have the best day ever* Coffee would be served in cups.  I totally have a terrible idea for a pottery coffee “cup”.  If anyone in the cafe quotes Brandons videos the baristas will throw a handful of beans into the air. The lattes will be served with a dash of edible purple glitter.  Customers can order the “there might be a spider in your coffee” and if there is and they eat it they get a $100 gift card to the cafe.  These are my bad ideas of the day. You’re welcome.
do mochi next pls
Brandon is my joy-joy therapy.  So much appreciation, gratitude, respect, and thanks for all you do.  Always wishing the best for you and your beautiful family💖  Needed this today, husband lost his younger brother last night.
Watch out this is tasty’ got me every time lolol
Did he just casually eat a Carolina reaper?
I'm dying🤣🤣🤣 Brandon your awesome my guy

Go to 3:23 and watch it in 0.25 speed
Yaaaaaay. When Brandon
I love your videos u rock u are soo sunny and I love watching ur ideas run wild

When you watch old brandon videos vs new ones you can see him slowly become more open and talk....differently? Idk how to put it man he let go of his innocence
Hi
The fact that Brandon tortured himself eating hot peppers just to amuse us is pure commitment right there.
new place?
I feel like Google Translate Makes a Mess is a more accurate name for the playlist
new kitchen? ._.
Imagine having to clean all that after 😳
👁️👁️
