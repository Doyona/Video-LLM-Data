Looks good 👍 good work 👌 I didn't know you were so good in the welding area 👍
Rudy i bet it's nice having a girl friend who's not afraid of getting her hands all greasy, miy long time ago girlfriend would only stand and watch me work on my cars.
👍👍👍
Another great video Rudy and team, From kiwi land.
Looking good
Rudy you need a hair cut bad. LOL
There's nothing better than a blue welder
I wish you much success on your channel Rudy, I'll continue to watch. I love your down to earth attitude and able to laugh at your mistakes, keep up the good work!!🤗 Verna from Elizabeth WV.
You and Janelle always work great together.  Iam glad the engine work out. And Dads are always there.  Oh what is that big metal thing behind you? Love your videos.
impressive gadget making.
Rudy is awesome. Janelle is beautiful. But, I wish Otis the dog had more time on the show lol.
👍👍👍👍👍
Engines are fuel motors are electric
2:50 you know she loves you when she willingly "polishes & buffs" your parts! Lucky guy Rudy a beautiful young lady with a compassionate heart. Can't go wrong on this one my friend! Pretty sure you already know this however 😏.
I'm a little late to this party on this one, but just in case no one has told you, that cable is called a kickdown cable, a throttle valve cable, or T.V. cable. It's a manual form of communication between the throttle and the transmission that is responsible for shifting into a lower gear under full throttle conditions, like passing a car on the highway, climbing a hill, etc.
Throttle kickdown cable aka passing gear
Love Bostons! Go Otis!
What did you do to need a motor?
Hay that build so much fun to watch. Keep up the good work.
Lots of squats
Hey Rudy, just watch another video where you where climbing a hill and the power steering was squealing! Try Lucas power steering stop leak and squeal!!!! It worked in my expedition,was afraid I was needing a new pump! I had a quick lube shop tell me ,Lucas fixes nothing!!! Really!!! It has saved me thousands of dollars over the years!!!
I was unaware Matt is Rudy’s dad. Love both of their content!
Enjoy watching your channel, you tell it like it is true and honest. You are are lucky to have a help mate that will  help you. Does she run the camera for you. I’m glad you went out on your own. Keep up the good work.
Way to go
You mean you didn’t media blast with baking soda the engine compartment and paint it with epoxy paint????? For shame! 😢
Hope you changed the oil in it
Where is the new built motor?
What kind of dog is Otis?
how is a motor different from a engine?
I always loved that jeep color
The jump was epic. The landing was suspect. Lol but it didn’t break! So. Epic it is
I admire your knowledge bro! Thanks for sharing!
. 17:11 Flight of the Rudicon .
Guess what chad 6:25
Enjoyed watching you put the engine back into your Jeep.  I'd say that the completion was due in part to your girlfriend coming back.  Because your attitude got back on track when she showed up.  You were kind of going down hill before her arrival. Good video and did you ever notice her walking around with the air filter on her head? Stay safe and show the young lady how much you missed her.
16:42 Hurricane's H reminds me of the best prank ever.   My town also has an H up on the mountainside. My eldest son graduated in 2011, and for his class's senior prank they covered the middle, horizontal bar in the H to make it read 11, for the class of 2011. Pure genius, this was. A prank that can be done once every 100 years. They'd even put tarps over the white rocks before covering them with dirt so that they could easily restore the H later. No vandalism, just a clever prank.
That’s a beautiful XJ wanna fix mine lol
Y’all really showed off the skills you learned stickin that engine in place with few hands on deck. Safely too. Congratulations. Glad Matt had a spare starter with donuts and wreckers on tap. Happy daze.
Are you no longer working for your dad?
Are we just going to ignore lake Mead underneath the Rudicon?
a fortunate person finds a partner to love
Wow. That battery situation is beyond known words.
Glad to see the Rudicon back on the Dirt Roads!
Nice work making your own channel. I’d like to see the Rudy con finish. Great work.
Very impressed with all of your know how.
Rudy did you do any work on the energy before you put it back and you all gearbox let's face that you are going to give that vehicle some stick.
I bet you can't wait to put the energy back in. The 2nd note that was some very nice work and some beautiful wealthy congrats Keep the good work up and keep doing the videos billions
You might want to consider adjusting that kickdown linkage.
Where does Rudy work, the shop is larger then Matt's.
Go Rudy ! I hope this channel thrives as does your dads !  shout out from Australia :)
needs a V8 🤬
I’m surprised to see you working on a small metal part with a hand drill. I got a floor stand drill press for $100 and bought a new chuck for $60. Same unit (if I’ve got my channels correct) as on Fab Rats. Craigslist is your friend. So are yard and estate sales. You could make the drill press hunt into a video!
6:35 or so, “and it’s sitting under it’s own weight.” Please remember that, when rock crawling, it has to to a bundle more than sitting under it’s own weight! Keep up the good work! Onward and upward!
Don’t be a litterbug, pick up those E12’s and throw ‘em in the garbage!!
I had no idea that you had a channel. great video. Love the Rudicon.. i am now a new subscriber. Keep up the good job.
Thank you Janell for the help you gave Rudy,..for without you it would have taken longer for him to get it done. Rudy awesome you and your brother got it done. shoutout to your brother and Janell for helping you.. awesome work guys.
What are the structures you are building in the background ? I see uni strut welded in there, so being an electrician I would use that to hang electrical gear. So I’m going to guess that they are small telecom shelters or something similar. Love the new Chanel
Go Jenelle… awesome.  Sorry if I misspelled your name.
pretty lady in the shop gets my sub
With that battery setup on the floor you can also weld with 1/16th rod...in the boonies
Rock on Rudy  May I suggest u invest in M12 Milwaukee IMPACT and LONG reach ratchet wrenches.... Other brands will work but you look very professional....not...L O L
..... nice hat! 'The 'Rudy-Cone' ?
... it's always nice when one can designate the little brother the official creep for the evening
Wait, I’ve been watching all these years…and I’m just now realizing you’re Matt’s son? Where the heck have I been all this time 😂
I love the rubycon
Inline-six. one of the best engines ever built!
Matt is proud of you.  You are killing it.   This is not no American Choppers.
lol if I jumped my tj like that with the dana 30 up front it'd be cambered😂
Don't leave your battery on the concrete floor it will drain the battery try using a block of wood
I think when it's completed you should rename it the RADICON!  btw, you and your brother have been very inspirational in helping my son find passion in taking on new projects!
Awesome to see a young lady whose not afraid to work with vehicles, get dirty, turn wrenches and put up with the BS that comes with it; she's a keeper!!
I am surprised that some people will spend so much on a vehicle but not buy a $2,000 lift to make all of this work easier. Blows my mind... and I do this for a living
What do you do for income?  Nice shop.
Nice view out the doors of the shop.  You got your dad on that! 🙂
Got to be honest, after just dropping an engine in, I thought you were wrong about that starter being bad... I was thinking a pinched or disconnected wire somewhere.
Awesome work Y’all!🤙
Yes I truly injoed the video today.  You all are AMAZING my friend.
There you are Randy . I've Ben watching you on Matt's off road recovery.  But now I'm subscribed to you channel to . Thanks for sharing buddy.
When you are on your father's channel you should tell people you have a channel.
Awesome Otis bat dog shot
Great job Rudy 👍. Now your ready to help out your pops, when he needs professional help.  Nice jump 😉.
Typical jeep doesn't want to start
Oops
I was/am really hoping for an ignorantly over the top engine being put in the Rudicon. 🥲
By watching your channel and your dad’s channel it seems like Lizzy is a blessing in disguise, as she grew and stepped up, you were able to spread your wings and start your own following. I’m thankful we get to see you grow on your own. Keep doing you brother, it’s working.
Colin needs a hair cut!
Good job to all!
Was that a six volt, or twelve volt jumpers?
So, the "-con" part of the Rudicon name is short for "constant project," right?
Nice
Excellent I've watched your dad for years now I'm watching both of you
Hey, im sure someone has commented this already but it would be cool to build your own 4.7l stroker using the old 4.0 and a junkyard 4.2 from a cj or something.
Rudy why do you always drill a hole, then run your thumb over the sharp edges? Not to worry, all my friends and almost everyone that I have ever seen drill a hole does the same thing.
Man, that's nothing. I pulled and replaced a motor in under 3 hours. I mean, it was a 69 VW... but still. lol
Great job and I know you’re all happy.
Did you make her go shag your drone?!?!
Not sure if it is good idea to toss old bolts... until after the job is done and you have no left over parts(or missing one)
so nice
Straight six, love that sound 👌😎
I thought you could just use a couple of items from "Phil Swift's Family of fine FlexSeal Products" to hold the Motor in Place.  I'm moderately disappointed. :(
good
love it rudy, love the send the most!
Hey, what welding helmet would you recommend.
Awesome job Rudy!!!
Nice job on the drone work
Great job Rudy.
Love the ingenuity for the throttle fix!
I wish my girlfriend, fiancée, and now wife would help me on our two Jeeps as much as ours does! 😂   I would get 2x as much done.
Janelle always looks so excited whenever she "helps" you  LOL Just a thought though ... maybe you should better explain the issues you run into such as not starting & why you would redneck 2 batteries together  finding solutions & try'n things others have  is most of the necessity of older vehicles  maybe showing issues & how you solved them would help out others ??
The best part was when you tossed the star bolts for the top of the trans mount.  I did a 4.0 swap a few months ago and those little buggers were unfriendly...haha.
Are u thinking about v8 swap?
The transmission sensor thing you broke is called a kickdown cable
" VALLEY OF THE GODS"     TOUR   👇
Get your girl some latex gloves Rudy. No shame in clean healthy hands.
Why do a lot of guys in Utah were cowboy boots?
When welding out broken bolts weld a flat washer to the broken piece first, then weld a nut to the flat washer. This has really helped me get exh man bolts and turbo mounting bolts out many times.
nice
**RUDY IS SUCH A NICE GUY = LAID BACK & EASY GOING AS CAN BE = PLEASURE WATCHING HIM DO HIS THING!!! GOD BLESS RUDY & HIS ALL!!!**
Nice job on the instal. Up and running, now go get dirty.
Nice!
Have you introduced sweetie to us the public? If you did I missed that video. You need to keep her busy so she doesn't loose interest. Also, I'd like to see a little more discussion about whatever it is you're doing in the moment...like Matt.  Maybe I could help you with some RUDICON sign vinyl for the old Jeep. I'm a retired design guy with a few talents and a vinyl cutting system.
That green skateboard looks awesome bro. Where you get her?  7:14
Passing gear cable. Transmission shifts to a higher gear to give you all you got to pass up a slower vehicle.
That cable from the trans is the kick down cable its very important it's right or ull be in 5th gear by 25-30 mph😂😂😂love the progress
Why is she doing all the dirty work? Were is his safety glasses? Yes I am a pain in the ass. I have been a machinist and welder for a very long time.SEEN TO MANY PEOPLE GET HURT.
👍👍Good job!
Banana Split's legacy lives on! In the Rudicon AND the Banana! It died and donated all its vital organs. 😆
About 30 years ago I was a lot like Rudy. Those were the days. I learned so much. Trial and error was often my teacher. But man oh man, what a feeling it was to turn the key, crank the engine, and hear that machine begin to rumble and come back to life. Good job by all. Enjoy life, embrace challenges or set-backs, because they are opportunities to grow and accomplish more than you can imagine at the time.
Awesome work on truck 🚚 🛻 and helping your 👨‍👩‍👧 dad out .
Glad to see you using "anti-sneeze" on your bolts.  I always do this when putting things back together.  Makes life so much easier for next time!  Also, Otis is cute!🐕
What kind of dog is Otis? I have a dog that looks similar, mine is a French bulldog. Nice that you got Rudicon running!
We need more Otis.
otis is a beast!  more videos showing the life and times of his world would be cool.. oh, and good job on the jeep.
Right when u picked that top bellhousing bolt I yelled at my TV and said through that bolt away! You had to of heard me. Lol. Good job!
I'll see your Lizzy and raise you a Janelle! Nice work you guys!
Amazing! Rubicon lives and fabricating was done. When does it go to Robbie for painting?
Rudy…….  Good job : )
Good work Rudt ! But why do you allways work whith dirty parts . Why not degrease and wasch them and paint them first . I must be nicer to work whit clean parts ? KM in Sweden .
Nice work.. That landing at the end worried me for a minute though.
Rudy, glad she’s back on her wheels with a strong heart ahead of her. Still “half dun” or…?
Rudy, you are a man after my own heart. Well done dude, you are doing it for yourself. Your challenges will be many, but your rewards will be greater. I've been an avid follower of your dad, but you've got my attention. All the best and I look forward to seeing your progress. God bless. Charles Kennedy from Australia.
Ruddy is that your own shop? Glad to see it’s up and running smoothly. Great video.
What did you do to the motor????did you go through it completely  ???let us know
Do you have merchandise yet?  My wife said I need a half done hat and shirt!!!
How come you have the best looking helper of all the 4wh channels???
👍
Otis says, nothing like wind in my hair n bugs in my teeth!
man the view out those doors is amazing! what a pleasure to work in a space like that
Great job thanks for sharing 👍🙏😎
Back in bidness! Nice 👍🏻
I just feel all the rust and dirt falling into my eyes in this video
I'm gonna subscribe because of that jump 👍
6:05  Working with Anti-Shneeeeeze. Should of spray painted yourself silver for the seconds after this moment. LOL
You should always Loctite your converter bolts
Seems weird not seeing you doing the recovery work. Never forget the family business and best of luck with this thing
Y'all too cheap to get an engine hoist?
Trying to catch up, what engine did you install??
Awesome jump there in the end 👏 😎
The best place for ECU unit is in cabin on the roof. This think hates to be flooded. So if you not planning to waterize Rudycon, and suddenly you are in the water - that thing will give up first.
That is amazing great job
Rudy, do you not have friends that want to come help you?
Glad you found a good woman in your life that will help you with your builds. She really supports you and does it to spend time with you. Marry that one before she gets away...
Nice work Rudy.Its great to see you young guys getting it done.Hey don't forget your ground straps.Dont ask how I know.
Didn’t know you had your own channel. Just subscribed!
Great Crew Rudy! I think you are going to have a great time with your channel! You are really good at being you... keep doing that!
Awesome job Rudy! So glad to see the Rubicon back in action. the drone footage above the cliffs was amazing! Looked so good and so glad you found the drone and did not break the Rudicon over the jump.
Boston Terriers are the best.
In YouTube time it is one day
Well done! 😃
Are you not helping your dad anymore??
10:13 that i believe is your kick back cable.
👍
Poor man jumper cables. Pull the good fully charhed battery out of the rig you drove, put it in the jeep, start it and then remove the good battery you just started it with and put the dead battery in its place. That rig should have no problem running with no battery in it and once its running it will charge your current dead battery....option that works in a pinch
So satisfying when you have the mechanical ability to do your own work. And a woman that will help her man work on his jeep -She's a keeper
Go back to work at Matt’s off-road towing
Should’ve got a junkyard LS bro hall that work it would’ve put a huge smile on your face driving it with extra screaming eagles  America 🇺🇸💪🏼
Hey Rudy?  Any girl who would walk around with an air cleaner on her head, prolly is a keeper.   Jus' sayin".    Nicely done, J.
Great Videos Boss 👍 Can I barrow ur girl I bring it back 👫 lol . ARIGATO ✌️🙏🙏🙏
What axles are you running? Same as the Banana?
Way to go
It feels like Rudy baby explains in a weird way he didn't when on Matt's channel
Mr mitten hands don't have nothing on miss filter hand
I love seeing Janelle working beside you.  She reminds me of my wife when we were both much younger.  She would always help me whenever I worked on our vehicles.  My son still talks about how his mom would be right there beside dad working on our Blazer.  And, she was a petite city gal!  She has a very good mechanical aptitude and diagnostic intuition.    You rock, Janelle!!!
Great video good to see it running again.
New motor it needs new name should be the "rudykong"
ever think ya might have power washed under the hood before reinstall??
Nice Boston, we had two of them.
Great video 📹
You are so mechanically competent. Creativity and ingenuity are tops. I’d have never contemplated use of the welder to help remove a broken bolt stud
Rudy****Tell me you did not go on a Maiden Voyage solo without any backup !!!!!!  Good Job**Good Times
You best get the a/c charged up. Summer is here!
It LIVES ,, new adventures await. .??
That Clark is a fine piece of machinery. No need to check the oil, just add when it stops leaking!!
Great video brother
Love your channel guys!! Rudy and Janelle are great, but OTIS STEALS THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for all the effort putting it together and keep putting in Otis clips!
Rudy is like his dad. He has to touch hot metal to see if it is still hot. Ouch!
Keep the videos coming!!!  Rudy you keep it real, and keep the viewer watching from start to finish as you learn yourself some of  the nuances and gain knowledge of the projects your doing!  Yeah maybe 10% of the viewers could possibly R&R an engine if that however it’s cool your being successful and gaining different knowledges while keeping it cool but real!  Enjoy your videos keep em coming Bud!
Dude you got youtube money now. You can get a prettier girlfriend now
Goodbye stupid weird e12 transmisssion bolt that takes 20 extensions to get to!
That’s a. Good sound 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
If this motor blew next one should be an LS
I could just imagine Otis saying " weeee" as you were driving. Enjoy
I said the same thing you did about the batteries, Janelle.
Hey Rudy, watch Rainman Ray ... get a magnetic flashlight for the shots in the engine bay and on the creeper, be much better, it's surprising how interesting it is to actually see the detail in the engine bay and drive line, etc.  Appreciate the content though, always good, Colin's turning into a champ, find something more interesting for Janelle that to do than other cleaning parts - I know it was partly tongue in cheek, but everyone has interests and cleaning parts usually aint it : ), cheers guys, keep at it.
You have just about the same luck as me with my 2000 XJ lol. Can’t figure out my bad idle issue I’m having now, replaced the TPS cleaned throttle body and all that but still no go 😂
rip that bolt....😂 the only thing i recommend doing asap is exhaust  as the exhaust fumes in cab will not be good
Nice job Rudy and Jenelle Very Kool
Nice work ❤
the last minute is what u clicked for
Does she only do leg presses? Dear lord.
Rudy, that's the kickdown linkage, so the trans drops a gear under hard acceleration. It's important to adjust it properly, or the trans will play strange tunes when driving.
Otis looks so happy riding in the back with the window open!
You need a wiring upgrade kit. The 160 amp 2002 Dodge alternator upgrade is easy and helps so much with winching.
Good Job Rudy, glad to see you up and running.
Improvisation at its best. Loved the vid and looking forward to the next one!
As easy as that sheared off bolt seemed to come out, a pair of locking pliers might have been enough to get it out.
Otis is great! 😆
I bet he finds that bolt next video in his tire
Man! I think I’m gonna move to Hurricane and open a barber shop! The Wetzel clan would keep me in business for years! (JK- love you all!)
I hope there is a rebuilt motor in your  future just to eliminate weak links
Rudy, this girl loves you. Treat her well.
Better to be a Rude than a Rube!
I was in Hurricane. Stopped by Matt's Off-road. Wanted to stop by and see you place. Maybe next time.
Rudy bro you got a shot at Lizzy, go for it. Your website will die but go for some happiness.
Two words, inverted torx. Two more, Hate Them! Rudy, loved your moment of expression about them!!! Absolutely beautiful.
Never sit a battery on a cement floor… I buoying the vids bud. Good job 👍
Really looks good !.
Wow,  donuts, that's AwSum.  .  .
Otis says 10 out of 10 stars for that ride!
Otis is the MAN!!   Boston Terriers are absolutely the best.      Great video
Kick down cable
Miss you on your dad's channel but that was fun .get it tuned up now put timing in it make power.
Glad to see you're up and running again.
Way to go Rudy!! Perseverance pays off again!! Just a little tip about overhead doors. Get in the habit of raising them completely. I build metal buildings for a living and have had to repair/replace quite a few doors that have been fubar’d over the years. Keep up the hard work!
Dirty Boys have cool toys. Enjoy kids.
Well done go Team Rudi! Glad to see the Rudicon come back to life.
To bad your Dad wasn’t there to tell ya it was hot after welding your bracket.
The rudicon's front suspension is by far and away my favorite on YouTube.
The skills you’re developing will carry you far young one. Rise and shine. Bravo Zulu!
Great Job! Hi Otis!!
Nice solution to that star-head safety bolt.  I throw those things as far away as I can too!  lol  Nice to see the Rudicon back on the road and trail!
Thumbnail looking like a forza 5 screenshot at first glance
Nice tv cable repair ! Epic 🍻🍻🍻😎🔧🔧
Maybe I missed it, did you get the lockers in?
You need to do a Q and A
Sorry to see you are not Involved at all with your father. Hope it is not a girl if so u will be so sorry later
I just changed the clutch in our xj an those stupid e12 bolt's throw nice.
Rudy, I love the channel, but can you please put the apostrophe in "Rudy's" in your channel name? :)
well done that man .
Good Job RUDY & team!

Editorial: Could It Be that the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway."? It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise.

Janelle's expressions are priceless! Good to see the Rudicon in the dirt!
Good
Yippee!!!!
Am I mistaken or did you do that without removing the AC condenser very impressive.
Hi Rudy, you seem to be working nights mostly, you must be working a day job also?
4:20 This the best Jeep content I have ever seen!  17:21 Also, your passenger-side turn signal is upside-down.
Go on  a hard trial  with the rudicon next episode
Enjoyed it a lot, I was wondering when we were going to see you again, looks like your cruising(rolling) again, glad that little jumps didn't damage it again 🤣😂 be great to see you back out on the trails, all the best to yous and your loved ones
SWEET!!!!
That test drive got our man some, some some  😝
Genial is thick
Rudy that is so cool you get that motor in and everything wired up properly sounds good Have a question for you how come you moved out of your dad's shop?
Ouch ouch, you are your fathers son.  I like Collins skate board.
https://youtu.be/-NMqhvBdFMk
Nice working
Nice build man!
Good video
Great job Rudy, I enjoyed watching this
Great job rudy & Janelle
So u have ur own shop now and why are u not on ur dads videos anymore
First there was Matt's Offroad Recovery Channel, then there was Rudy's Adventure and Design.  Now we need to have a channel for Colin's hair, which seems to have a life of it's own.  LOL  Oh, yeah, and the Rudicon need a Mack truck bulldog in honor of Otis.  Peace.
Does this mean you can start on finishing it now?
It’s alive! Now back to the upgrades. 😁
Your good creeper only lasted me a week. The second one didn't last a day. It might be my weight or me trying to roll them over tools. Or a combination of the two. 😂
Rudy, I was born in a gas station in 1956. You remind me of me. I love Your family, The Fab Rats, Robby Layton Nation. I love to watch all you have going on! Thanks Rudy!
Great job Rudy like the fad work
Good Job Rudy !!!!
Colin is no Lizzie -  but a sexy girl who knows about engines is a good replacement.
👍
I always thought Rudy and lizzie would end up together but I guess this girl is thicc
Good job crew.
Always feels good to them back up and running!
Come on Rudy, great job and we want more! Keep it up and pump up the energy! 🤙🤙🤙
All right now try that with the tractor trailer engine cat C15 and transmission on that it's fun
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
God so loved the world that He gave His only Son Jesus that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16
i like seeing Janelle helping. she brings a calm energy that matches yours.
Hey man, not sure if you’re using lav mics or just a shotgun on camera, but your shop has a ton of reverberations when the camera is far away and it’s not easy to focus on what you’re saying. If you get some decent lav mics it should help make the videos a bit more engaging 🤙🏽
9/16 th DUN
Great Job Rudy. Is Janelle your employee, girlfriend, wife, best friend...? Its great to have someone like that to help you in the shop. My wife doesn't come out and help me in the shop. I imagine she would if I twisted her arm. If this engine works why are you rebuilding the other one? Is it gonna be better than stock?
That was a successful engine install and trouble shooting with  the Rudicon back on the road again. Janelle was really a great help willing to jump in there and do what ever you asked, not too many girls like that. Did I hear you say something about painting it? Colin was also very helpful too and got things put back together correctly and functional. You all make a great team.
Way to go Rudy and crew. Tell Colin wait till you get your hair caught in the creeper wheels. Don't ask how I know
Rudy. What happened to the covair truck you showed about a year ago
GREAT JOB! You had a great helpers is probably the reason.  Especially Janelle.   I give her a lot of credit for not hitting you with a greasy piece of sheet metal after you said "Oh and here is one more".  Is it still  the1/2 DUN?
Its gotta be hard to work on a vehicle wearing nothing but body paint...
Brilliant bolt extraction
Those goddam star bolts. YUCK!
Good job glad to see Janell jumping in to help and Collin helping too!
"""one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something .he always respect us , the audience and his team , and he is polite in all his videos .we congratulations ourselves on this achievement . more to come 💕
I respect everyone who were involved in this , seriously the best piece that I ' ve ever seen on YouTube ,Hats of the Well All ! Love your videos💓
Support the main gig it looks like you got it going. This not so much
Looks super capable. Nice build Rudy.
👍👍👍👍👍
The opening drone shot was stunning.
Hey! I hope you all are having a great day/ night! Jesus loves you! God bless!
This is like the "chill" version of Matt's ORR.  Both filled with warm likeable people.
finally a video !!!!!!!!!!!  wahooooo 8) !!  good on you Rudy for bringing the ol girl back  to life now u two can cruise the back roads together !!!!!!!!!!!!!!    there is no one i'd rather share the back trails/road than w my sweetie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
get the girl some gloves.
Great work. :) When does it graduate to "3/4 DONE"? The channel needs more Otis IMHO. I am looking forward to seeing this rig tackle some tough terrain.
We generally call that a kick down cable. It biases the transmission towards a lower gear with more throttle so your description isn't bad.
You should have pointed out Molly’s nipple on your video..
RUDY...weld a flat washer over it then weld the nut to it !
Rudy great job on assembling a great team and the Rudicon.
You should have shown your viewers how to test a starter after you took it off. 🤔🤔🤔

RUDY HOW FAR IS YOUR SHOP FROM YOUR DADS
Rudy I really enjoyed this video in my opinion you, Janelle and Colin work good together as a team. Janelle has incredible balance balancing anything on your head takes true skill. I am glad you didn't hurt the Rudicon on that hill. Keep up the great work
@15:22 One time I used 3 dead batteries and a dead jump box to start my Wj.
Currently redoing the ac system on my xj, very impressive to see how deep you are going with it
Looking good Rudy. I gotta say Janelle is lot better looking than Colin. So, the Rudicon went from have done to half dead. What is the status now?
When you're talking off camera, you sound just like your dad  LOL If you get stuck, who ya gonna call?
Nice job Rudy... and Janelle... and Collin!!!   Nice to see the Rudicon up and running again. Looking forward to seeing you out with the gang doing some awesome crawling!!
Kickdown cable, wish my wj had one instead of whatever the heck they used in 2000.
glad you got some good helpers, best of luck
Super job.!!! I know you could due it
Awesome little edit for the shakedown!
When you pulled the old engine & had to fight that one oddball trans bolt, I knew it was going to be ejected from the game.
Rudy are are you going to paint the Rudicon or is Robby Layton?
It's a throttle kick down cable
Sweetie needs to be Hugged and taken out to Dinner............   Take that damn tape off now!
Great job! Loved seeing the Rudicon back on the trail!
Great work, I'm glad you got it back together. God bless you all.
That's the kick down linkage for the transmission.  That way when you thromp the gas it kicks down to the lower gear. And did you put locktight on the flywheel bolts? Hope so.  Good luck and thanks for the video
Eso felicidades.
Gaawdbless yoger britches!
GO NAPA!
We want more videos! 😃 great job!👍🏼👍🏼
lol my napa guy is named Chad too
That cable also known as the trans kick down cable.
The alignment in the front looks a little toed out.  I'd check that out.
#18 on trending!!!
Funny just as I was wondering about that stupid E, whatever bolt, you throw it away😺
Been Watching Matts offroad for at least 2 years now, not until this video did I realize Randy is Matts son xD
Wait. Did I just see you weld a nut to a broken (sheared) bolt and you successful extract it? Incredible.  Oh, I have a girl friend comparison from a couple of generations back. Up on a mountainous snow covered road, looking for a Xmas tree to chop down. There is a ditch on the right side of the road, AND what with the snow it is very hard to how see close the 55 Buick Century is to said ditch. 1960's solution: have typical girl friend of the period hanging through the open right side window to inform me about the dangers of sliding into the ditch. Was wrongly feeling safe about this situation. Dumb, dumb, dumb guy (Me).  As 3,800' of steel and chrome begin to slip uncontrollably toward ditch the girl friend says, "You're getting close to the ditch."  Close! Close? I feeling the car moving that way and her line of sight says we are close! After the car frame made contact with the ground were we only close? (Some very nice people with a Jeep came by and were to pull my rig up out of the ditch. Otherwise we would still be there and only close.)  Personal conclusion: the intelligence quotient of females since that point in the past has grown by leaps and bounds!!! Can't make any comments about the intelligence quotient of males.
Nice to see the Rudicon back in action Rudy, way to go. Thanks for sharing
Yo!!! Rudy the Rudicon has a twin here in Vegas… A tire shop at Tropicana and Maryland Pkwy…. I will take a pic and send it to your Instagram..
You need to get a license plate that says "NEVRDUN"!
Thanks for sharing 👍😀
Hey Rudy and Crew 👍❤️✌️💪🏻
Great to see you, Janelle and Co. got the Rudicon back on the trail.  It appears that Otis approves!  It may, however, be time to update the painter’s tape!
Good video man I put a engine in my Toyota T100 4x4 today 👍
Every video needs Otis! LOL
I would of pressure washed some those parts before installing them and the radiator really needs it to cool better !
Would love to see more from Rudy adventure’s
Want to see you and your dad do more together.
Why not on Mat’s videos anymore?
Rudy, you are a very lucky man. You have a Jeep (at least, something that used to be a Jeep), AND an attractive girlfriend who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty.
Love that your girlfriend is right in there helping. We women make excellent mechanics given the chance.
Punch, center drill, then drill my friend... The hole will end up where you want it, not wandering off your stock.
Way to go Rudi
Otis..........
4:25 YEET!
Always set that kick down cable up correctly or you will stuff that trans in no time  Brian in Tasmania 👍🏻🇦🇺
Nice video Rudy. It's nice to see you working with your brother and Janelle on projects in your videos. Does she weld? If not, would she like to learn to weld? Lizzy does a great job welding on your Dad's channel, We love it when the girls weld stuff up too. ;)
Looks good!
That satisfying moment when it actually starts after an engine swap.
Janel is great to be turning wrenches like this.
Nice work crew. I’m glad the Rudicon is back on the trail again.
Felt like forever waiting for this episode.  Lol 😆  keep it coming .
16:25. For years I’ve wanted to take a truck up that road. For anyone who doesn’t know. That dirt road used to be the only way over the mountain to apple valley and beyond. So anybody in their now 60/70 years old cars were taking them up that dirt road if they needed to get to the next towns after Hurricane
I hope he used loctite on those convertor bolts!
Job well done Rudy.🕶️ God Bless and have a great day u3. 🇺🇸
She's a keeper. Nice job on the whole project.
Otis is cool, rubicon is up and working 👍🏻🇺🇸
Rudy your awesome man. Hopefully one day I’ll get to meet y’all and the rest of the crew of Matt offroad, once the gas price go down lol
Chad was probably laughing because you put a motor in the engine compartment. If you think about it, makes perfect sense.
Great video
Great to see you growing on BOTH sides of the camera Rudy. Glad to see the Rudicon moving under it's own power! And to all who keep looking for drama where there aint none,  Rudy: Dad I need a starter,    Dad: I got one you can have, Rudy: I brought DONUTS!!!  Thanks all around. :D:D:D    Annnnd at 15:45 might be time for 'Name that Part' with Janelle.
Howdy!
You need to take the beautiful help that is helping you with the engine to the best dinner you pay for .
Glad to see the Rudicon back alive .. when you drove it out for the test drive , i hope you bought Jaynel ( spelling?? ) lunch , because she deserved it
Yay!
Love it guys, you're inspiring!
It's Alive! Great work!
Hello rudy great video. What is the big h for . keep them great video coming.
Rudy, you're a lot younger & more adventurous than I. Been wrenching 40+ years, & my "test ride" after an engine install would be a couple laps around the block, not heading straight up into the mountains. Then again, I don't have MORR on speed dial!!! Also, real nice removal of the broken bolt with the hot wrench.
Good job Rudy the Rudicon lives again just in time to save your Dad's bacon lol 😆 & Otis got his ride ❤😉👍
I see you threw away the star bolts for the top bell housing, I think Jeep has gotten mor3 hate for those two bolts than all  other engineering opportunities they could have done. I was laughing when you tossed it. Best upgrade. If anyone knows why Jeep did that please enlighten the rest of us.
I really love this channel it is so awesome to see Colin helping his big brother :)
Good job Rudy !
COOL But You Almost  Broak A BUNCH H 🤪
Awesome to see your brother working with you.  The next generation of Utah fabricators arises.
Good job everyone.
Why have we not seen you on MORR since your channel started? Did you quit working for your Dad?
Always amazing content love from Canada ♥️
Good job Rudy you guys got the jeep up and running again, now you can help with recoveries lol and you are so lucky to have awesome girl like Jennell helping out
13:11 is that a bug or a damn hole in your arm? lmao
Otis made this video dogs are the best
👍
Good job 3/4 dun now
Rudy, you have definitely got yourself a FIRST RATE partner!!  A woman that will help you work on your ride is a rare thing.  Be nice to her.  She is a keeper.    Your Jeep sounds AND looks good.  I did like your jumper pack.  LOL  Hey, whatever works.  Right?
Can't wait to see Janelle out lift you
Anybody else notice the small "Z" next to the big H?  Todays Easter Egg.
Big job well done 👍 couple more TEST TRIPS!!! Just like a huge puzzle!!!  Thanks for sharing!
The RUDICON DESERVES A BIG TURBO
On the starter bolts if you start them by hand, then use a bunch of extensions you can snake them through the radiator support and ac condesor when you have the front grill off. Makes it go quick instead of 1/4" turns against the firewall.
Excellent!!
why use one good battery when 3 dead ones will work, hahaha
I give props to Colin... he got a real neck workout thus video. I'm still waiting for the adjustable head mount creeper
Rudy I have an idea on how to put more Showmanship into your videos! The next time that you're working on something and that you have a list of accomplishments. Put a adequate size whiteboard on a wall in your shop. Now I know this is being done on other YouTube channels but you have something someone that nobody else has, Janelle. Off-camera have her list your goals on the Whiteboard. On the item that you working on haven't put a star by it then go back to the shop work on the g o a l, when accomplish have Janelle put a line through it follow that by having her put a star next to the next one on down through the list. It will extend your video time I truly had a touch of Showmanship to your videos. It will also show the guys how lucky you are to have a beautiful girl that is not afraid to get her hands dirty the guys will eat their hearts out on how lucky you are. Thank you Janelle I enjoy your appearances you don't say much, but but the looks that you give with your eyes and the mannerisms you give with your and hands body say it all. Vanna White has nothing on you.
Bored, maybe. Good posture, definitely.
You should do a video making a helmet hanger for the gas bottle and a plate for the welder to organize like Finnegan did
Great job Rudy
Best thing about your smile is that you always have it on!  :)  Cute girlfriend helping you out there too!  ;)
Can I ask what else you do in your shop?  There is a lot of metal in the background and some sort of jigs?  I know that in the past you have done an extensive  amount of welding and did the gate on the MOR Compound??
Thanks for the video Rudy I always enjoy them.
Rudy you realize how much juice is getting sucked out of your batteries while they sit on the ground why do you think the ground is called the ground. Wood blocks man
fliiinnnnnngg......*TWANK*
Nice work, & a little playtime too...
"Should I not be confident?" Rudy is just like his dad, a great motivator, teacher, and leader of his people. Love this guy.
I've been sitting with an empty frame for 2 years. Hopefully I'll be moving this direction this month tho
I love the new bracket your made to hold your throttle cable to the Throttlebody Looks a hell of a lot stronger than stock I might have to make the same thing now
congrats Rudy , new sub here i love my jeeps  OIIIIIIIO
Post more don’t lose momentum
Otis steals the show at the end!  Yay Otis!!!
Glad to see her going again , first time I've seen the big H  pretty cool
👍👍 Glad to see your progress!
Nice job!!
I see a serious need for a dedicated Otis channel! :)
Great job!!!!
That made me laugh so hard! Those 2 stupid bolts on the top are enough to make someone’s head EXPLODE!!! I wanted to find the person who thought that was a good idea and, kick him right square in the beanbag!!!😬😤😡🤬
Good work Rudy. I’m glad you got a good crew including Otis.
👌🥸
Glad to see you’re not using electric fans. Those only make sense for on-road vehicles.
Jesus is coming repent of your sins be ready
I think you should have more help helpping.you.
Good job! Thanks!
Enjoyed the build thanks for sharing.
If you make a ruddicon shirt with Otis on it I would definitely buy one
Always love your updates. Thanks for sharing.
Got it running and no band aids! Awesome job! So is it still 1/2 Dun with new motor? 👍👍👍👍
Rule #1 in my world: Remove all jewelry, chains, necklaces, watches before going into wiring, even if the battery has been removed. Period. Amen!
a job well done
Is that your boss's shop Rudy?
Good job!
Ditch the hair boys just saying
You made her touch the anti seize. Now its gonna be under her toe nails tomorrow
That cable is called a TV cable, or kick down cable. Make sue it is adjusted properly.
Lol anyone that pulled a xj motor understands why you threw that bolt out
Loose the hood rudy
Glad to see the Rudicon back up and running.
I’m guessing you don’t plan on ever removing the shock hoop
glad to see two brothers working together!  good stuff!
Hmmm , that engine didn't really sound "Stock"  ...............
I've been preaching to everyone since I changed the fuel filter in my ZJ - and it belched-out fine black 'silt'. Had no idea how long it may have been in there, but now here it is a week later and it could just be my mind playing tricks on me, but it seems to accelerate smoother and have a little more power. Someone tell me why I'm mentioning this?  The ZJ also has low miles (less than 120K), but of course - is almost 30 years old. I had previously put 10W30 Synthetic in it, but since changing to 5W-30, the oil pressure registers 10psi more in the mornings. Do you run any specific oil, viscosity, oil filter in your 4.0?   Anywho - Thanks for sharing this content with us and although I don't want to be judgemental at all - maybe Janelle (sp?) could at least 'make-believe' she's thrilled out of her mind to be helping you with your channel content? ~ Just sayin.
So impressive!
Just to consider to save yourself sometime next time mark all the connetors with blue painters tape  and a sharpie to know where they belong when you are reinstalling everything back and since you will be doing his entire job again soon when the other motor is rebuilt. You get the idea. You got soem good helpers there!
Now it need's to go to Robby Layton for a makeover
Hi Rudy it’s lovely seeing Janelle giving you hand so hi there Janelle you and Rudy make a lovely couple x
Love it very cool  keep it up
Next time you're down at fab rats, see if you can help Paul with the cad program for his plasma table.
You can get replacement plastic ends for that transmission cable if you want to look for one they slip right on without having to do any crimping or anything. It's called a throttle valve or TV cable. It's actually really important. I believe gm replacement ends are the same. I had to get a new end for one on a cherokee once. Also the cable is fairly easy to replace just stick with oem parts, the pan has to come off though.
I knew you could do it Rudy.👍🏽👍🏽👌🏽👌🏽🤙🏾🤙🏾✋🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙋🏽‍♂️😎😊
Now this may sound odd but it looked like you had her on Dish washing duty. 🤔 . Looking good and it's nice to see it back on the trails.
Perfect place for that trans bolt!
Good job Rudy, nice to see it back on the road.
+So now the Rudicon went from being 1/4 done to 3/4 done right??? and it is still 60% better than my 4X4 Approximately.
5.3 ?
nice work!! im lovin Otis👍
It’s always Chad. Glad to see how quick the channel is growing.
We love Ottis and you guys your the best !!😎👍🏻🇺🇸🦅
Those donuts looked amazing.
So can you call it 9/16 done rudi-con?   Lol.  🤘🏼🇺🇲
Donut Fans=Best Fans
Im getting distracted by the help 👀
👏👍👊🏆🙏
Hello Rudy very good job 🦾🤠🇺🇸💐
I think you should drive it up to Paul's and do a burnout, I hear he loves that.
Glad you got it together and running, so Otis could have his ride.
I see you're a big fan of those external torx bolts.
So now is it 3/4 done...?
I just made myself a cup of cofee. Rudy just made a fantastic Video.  This combined makes my day sooo much better.  ❤️♥️❤️
" as far as I can tell" LOL
Curious..  what's Janelle's major  🥂
Are Janelle and Lizzie related? They have the same Ride or Die work ethic
She have an only fans?! Asking for my dad
Good day " Sir RUDY & Family . . . 👍👍😊
Quite the Mickey Mouse rig. Lol.
Great vid, Bud! I am well experienced with walking around with an air filter on my head as well. I'm the hold the light and get the drinks guy, so when wrenches are clicking and clanking, I stay out of the way.
Otis got to stick his head out the window on his ride
I hope you did a NAPA drive-by!
Does this mean the "½ Dun" sticker will be removed/replaced now?
like to see what you are doing in the shop, ie, projects , great to have you back
It's ALIVE!  Congrats Rudy.  Quite impressive.
Great Job!
Expecting great things with the revived Rudicon and channel. Thanks for video.
Should  be called the partially done Rubicon
You are a chip off the old block. Blessed.
👍looks ok
Good job throwing away those two funky top bell housing bolts.  Why they decided that was a good idea is beyond me.
It's about time! Good to see the Rudicon back on the road! Well done Janelle and the boys!👏
no detailing of the engiine  ever thing  cumon
Yesss
Colin is a good hand. I would put him full time on the payroll before someone else does.
I had to wait 3 months for OE throttle position cable so I did the same thing and fixed mine for the time being the same way
You really need to drop a 5spd in this thing.
It's nice to see some one starting from the beginning on a YT channel but I would recommend going to skill share, and YouTubes business plan. to bring videoing and things together. But what do I know I'm just a long time viewer.
OUTSTANDING!🌟🌟🌟
Go Rudycon #ottisrocks
good job !
Your going to need a lift if your building vehicles. On the ground ain't getting it!
It must be nice to have such an adorable Helper and assistant/ cameraman. And Janelle's kind of cute too
it's awesome Rudy  to see the Rudicon back on the trail again.. love seeing Otis
Now that the Rudicon is running again and since he helped you, is the next project to build a truck for Kaulin ? ( okay dude I asked like you told me to, now where's my 10 bucks Kaulin ? )
Great video ! It's been awhile and I was afraid we were going to have to make a call . . . to have Matt and the crew go and find you. 😂
What mods do you have on your cooling system?
I feel you bro.   Toss those E12 bellhousing bolts in the bin!
That bolt you threw out. You'll need that later!
Hi Rudy missed bro 😊.. huge fan ..
Is Colin a brother too? How many MORR kids are there?
Who is Janelle?
Yeeessss, at last now is 85% done .... some final adjustments, painting issues and you will have that 100% done !!!  Just one suggestion, a little more of background music will be fine on your videos.
The Rudicon is looking good, now u need to have some kind of mission to go on that is exciting 👍
Go Rudy go!  Janelle, if your interested we can do a crazy hat contest?
That battery setup is almost Vice Grip Garage level quality... Only one has a "Go handle"... approved.
Nice that you have a well stocked experienced parts house on speed dial on your phone!
16:40 Yay, you are back in Jeep action. 👍
old days, start about sundown and by sunrise running down the road with another engine in
I find when I'm working underneath a vehicle, a headlamp is invaluable at putting light exactly where I need it and keeps my hands free
All that great work done and the Rudicon still 1/2 Dunn. Well done Rudy and crew!
Way to go Rudy!! Perseverance pays off again!! Just a little tip about overhead doors. Get in the habit of raising them completely. I build metal buildings for a living and have had to repair/replace quite a few doors that have been fubar’d over the years. Keep up the hard work!
We miss you at morr
Dorman makes repair kits for the throttle position cable kick down cable whatever you wanna call it
Otis is the best
wish you were in Texas Rudy. I have a vacuum problem on a jeep 4.0 Cherokee. has me stumped.
You do know Chevy LS fits perfect in a Cherokee... Your dad might have a few hanging around the yard
Glad to see it running again!
Great to see it alive and wheeling again!👍
It lives !
Yeah Chad - take that !  Nice work guys ..  now time for some adventures ..
Good job
Serious question. How sweet is your life?
Nice vid . You shoulda only taken one box of donuts inside . -Ken
I welded up a lift sling for motors, basically a frame that hooks to chains on whatever you lift it with, it lets you lift front and back, yaw and pitch, make's the job easiery
Thanks for sharing.
Nicely done, Rudy. Videos are getting much much better. Gotta give Janelle more work to do....she did look bored.  ;)
now all it needs is a good battery and working AC !
Vise grips on the stud?
Whats your actual job , Rudy ?
Miss seeing ya on the other one but good job on your truck
Finally able to get on the trails and do some rock climbing!  Good job Rudy and helpers!
Passing gear kick down cable. You're welcome. Great job Rudy and crew! God bless and stay well.
When’s paint, looks sick
You should ask Lizzy to help you out
I wasn’t getting any notifications!!! I rang the bell 🔔 so I don’t know. But it should be fixed now. We’re doing a one ton build on the Goat on 38’s. The engine bay is tight but yours looks good!! ❤️🐞 Bug
Attaway2go!
You should join back to Matt's off road recovery.
Like watching your dad & Lizzie, seeing you and your lovely wife working together is awesome 👏 I never imagined having my wife working with me but we are doing more together as she operated the tractor to drag walls of an old shed we took down (klutz me dropped the roof on my head)
Otis was the motivation to get the XJ going again
Thanks for the great videos,good job
nice to see ot going again
Jonelle rocks!
I know what to tell Matt and Paul and Robbie to get you for an early Christmas present for your shop
I like your channel Rudy, I think you and your crew would look even better in matching "Rudy" shirts?
Great job Rudy and crew  , can't wait to see more videos of it off roading  , I  really miss that .from Texas 🤠👍
I like the bigger and badder Rudicon, but I do miss the old Rudicon with "I think I can" attitude.
Sounds good!    The Rudicon lives!
that is the kick down cable that the end is broken off of 😎 or transmission detent cable for the anal retentive types🤭
Congratulations Rudy from South Africa
don't let Robby get to 1,000,000 before you do
Marry that woman. Today. Before lunch.
You need to have Janelle question and answer questions about car parts too just like Matt's wife does. Question and answer for Janelle 😁😁😁
More Otis... keep the content coming..
Thank you for sharing Rudy & Janell !!! 👍
I'm guessing that was the kick down cable that broke. Your a good fabricator Rudy!
Shoulda just reached right up there with your fingers to get that welded nut and bolt out.. Matt would have!   ;)
wow alot of work for a temporary motor.  Gonna be cool when your done!!
Has to feel great putting the engine back into the jeep.
getting there   sounds like a rock beast should
What I got out of this is now some poor soul is going to get a random bolt in their tire for no good reason at all. :(
Now that the Rudycon is back on the road, can't wait to see what's next for the  channel!
Thanks just game 10 lb from donuts 😋 nice to see you doing very well.
Congrats Rudy. You got a really special girl there.
Goodbye bolt 🤣
Thanks Rudy! Great work.
I love that the families are always there helping, it gives me faith that all will be well in our country.
It is good to see the Rudicon back on the road!
Rudy, you have some good helpers. She is not a gearhead and still is willing to take on whatever needs done. Otis is going to hold you to taking him for that ride. The nice thing is to see what you worked on doing what it is suppose to do,
I'm a big fan of your dad's channel so when you started yours I thought, of course, I'm going to check it out. Now I'm a big fan of your channel. You're one talented kid. Thanks for the content and stay safe.
💯💯 Rudy you should get students from the local high school auto body shop. You could have charged like a summer camp🤣🤣🤔🤔🤔🤔🤯😭 do the same thing with film in New Mexico
10:06 pretty sure it’s the kick down cable
Been awhile since we have seen you. Like your dog, use to have one just like it.
Paint it gunston orange and call it pumpkin
💯🤔 some reason I don't think your girlfriend likes doing that type of work🤔 I'm not a therapist but I did spend the night at a Quality Inn once🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glad to see it up and running again.  Nice to have the help of a good quality team.
Glad we dropped “lunch” off just in time! 😉🙌🏻
That's a great thing to see. Congratulations. Can't wait to see more videos soon. Keep up the great craftsmanship and hard work my friend. Weld on. Fab on. Keep Making. God bless.
I watch fabrats to see him make things, I watch matt to see him make things and team up, I watch robby because he is funny and works hard, I watch Rory to see him fix things and Moab looks cool.  I'm starting to watch this channel just for Jennele.  You welded something under the hood, not sure what or why. You put the engine in, but skipped how, other than the forklift goes down. I know forklifts go up and down. Bolts go in. Hoses, wires, computer, were they different than before? Why did they get changed or put where they went? I can guess, but maybe it would be interesting. It sucks that the jeep broke. Make the most of it.
Go rubicon!
Janelle is a very good sport!
Awesome job Rudy and crew
GREAT JOB.
If you had a tesla, you would have a MOTOR! You have an ENGINE! Please get these things write!
Love the last shot of Otis, living the dream, head out an open window, tongue flapping in the wind.
The fork lift makes a nice precision lifter... Nice hat Janelle 🙂 Sweet to be back on the road ag'in
I like how Colin holds the creeper like a skateboard .... well done folks!
I really enjoyed the tossing of that stupid inverted torx bolt
Be careful with that anti-seize, I'll guarantee you can paint your whole house with that can.
Glad you got the Jeep up and running.  Sweet jump! 👍🏼💪🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Great work! Otis is so cute!
“Well guess what chad, it’s In.” 😂
You’re a lucky boy, Janine is so patient with you!
Good catch on the early typo. 👌
It's ALIVE!! The Rudicon is back 🙌 🙆‍♂️
good job rudys...
Rad
Nice job Rudy I will be doing the same thing on my wrangler a motor swap soon
Glad to see the Rudicon back up and running. Good job crew.
Where does one get these grilfriends everyone's talking about?
It's aaaaliiive
Nice to see it back in action. XJs are the coolest
"Wow, that's quite the set up."  For sure.
Great video and glad to see it on the road great job God bless from GA
Awesome job guys 😎🇺🇸
Now..go do a trail mix.  Both food and dirt. Go..
Right on !!!! Good stuff as always mate.
Otis has his chariot again
OTIS approved,  The bored Lady supervisor way cool to put a greasy airfilter on her head .
Looked like you were going to rip that overhead door off the wall 😳😂
Good to see the Rudicon up and moving.
Rudy's like so this piece just broke I'll just make one😂. I hope to one day be as good as Rudy lol glad it's back buddy and can't wait to see what your gonna do with the old motor
Nice job guys 👍👍👍
Good job Rudy and crew! Enjoy your videos!
Nice to see you up and running again! And Ottis gets to ride.
I thought for sure you were gonna stuff the front bumper cresting that hill
I think that wire is for kicking the transmission down to a lower gear when you hit the gas hard. Kickdown is what that is referred to.
Congratulations Rudy it's taken a long time but you've got it up and going again
otitis rocks!
YAY!
🤙🏻🇨🇦🤟🏻
Congratulations guys.....big smiles are in order!!.... love it !!
Might be bored lmao you guys are hilarious
Good content put out more videos
Stock 4.0 motor and is that an AC radiator I see?
Rudy, that's the kickdown linkage, so the trans drops a gear under hard acceleration. It's important to adjust it properly, or the trans will play strange tunes when driving.
Good job!
Dang Rudy. The view outside your bay doors is amazing! South Texas ain’t got nothing on that. I want to see a shop tour!
Glad to see the Rudicon running again.💪👍👍
This channel is kinda boring
🤙🏻🇨🇦🤟🏻
It's strange how important a channel logo is.  Rudy's, no disrespect, fades into non-existence as I scroll past it in my notifications.
👍👍👍👍👍
SUPER - YEAH  ! !
Sweet
Nice work,  I can see one day, that you'll make a hoist for lifting engines, heavy parts and materials.  It will save your back and joints in the long run.
yahoo
Rudion? :D
TOUCH MY CAMERA THROUGH THE FENCE 	GARTH BROOKS IS A SERIAL KILLER!
What happened to Rudicon?
First , nope 2nd
Yee... Haw... More done Rubicon ✔
👍🏻
