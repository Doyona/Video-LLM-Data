WWE RAW Jay jimam
I'll never forget this day when tama became my favorite wrestler
What about Zila fatu would be the new tribal chief of his father Umaga tribal chief son. High chief will be Jacob Fatu.    Let’s do the match for undisputed tag team WWE universal championship title. Will be zilla.fatu and Jacob Fatu  face to street profits at Ring of fire pitch Black match. Wrestlemania 41 at Vegas tribal combat. Bad blood. And then next week will be wrestlemania 41 Vegas going to be Jacob Fatu going alone will face mr. Main event Jey Uso    What if Jacob Fatu and Zila fatu. And Tonga brothers. Would be going to Royal rumble and money in the bank and Summer slam.  And next following week, the tag team undisputed WWE, universal championships title would be the Tonga Brothers facing to Finn baller and. Dominic Mysterio. Next following week. Will it be great idea   on SmackDown to sent Roman reigns retirement and for Roman reigns bloodline OG retirement zilla fatu is the new OTC head of a table, tribal chief undisputed champion the next tribal chief Bloodline 2.0
Who’s here after jimmy’s return
Jacob Minnick ☝🏻
Who's here after SummerSlam?
This was the day I feel in love 😍
Poor Jimmy we haven't seen em' since the day he got betrayed by his lil brother Solo😔😔
I really don’t like Solo for turning on his brother oh wait it he has with Jey
Where is Roman Reigns at .
😂😂😂😂😂❤
4:35
Tonga went full Tazmanian Devil Mode on Jimmy Uso
Let solo be the new tribal chief
Umaga?
Paul hayman is so scery of Solo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤎
The new blood line loading!! Sikoa , Tonga & “Jacob fatu “🔥🔥🔥🔥
4:26 4:32
That's so awful
I miss Roman but I so glad that Cody won the championship title
Solo and the other person are suspended until further notice. Why didn't you see them on raw tonight???
O-34 solo record. He will never be my tribal cheif and ill never follow him 🤬😡😡
This is odd Paul heyman say they ain’t making excuses yet they using the excuse of reigns was distracted with hitting Seth with a chair bla bla bla 🥱
😂😂😂😂
It would have been most savage if jeys music came on and he didn’t come to his brothers rescue…. U gunna have to hire me @wwe for any further storyline advice🤣
Jimmy uso teams up with Jacob or Zilla Fatu
What was bleeped out?
Solo always looks like he's gonna kill someone lmao.
They're doing the Genesis of DX angle  ,when HHH took over and Xpac returned
Vince made the wwe fun sorry not sorry
This is really w a a c k
This is really w a a c k
The blood line is cringy
Crazy that the only time Solo showed Jimmy affection was when he's about to turn on him 🤯 Bloodline Cinema 🎥
Stupid twist Solo is the Tribal Chief of 1 person Jimmy, Jay, and Roman gone
We need Roman reigns asap
Solo and his companion is the mullet Wolfpack😂😂😂 party in the back and whoop azz in the front
What they mute ??
This was epic i hope we can hear no more words again though
I'd like I kind of remember of Roman reign in the locker room. Telling Jimmy that solo has a better chance of becoming the next tribal chief than he was.
😮😮😮😮😮😮 lord have mercy 😮😮😮😮😮
Is Roman off WWE for now?
AND JUST LIKE THAT the blood line story is over and just been grinded into the dust, it was going rapidly down hill after that lame jimmy turning on jay and then going back to roman.   i mean now roman gonna take a break for a while so bloodline era is over now after this lame segment. solo should of just gone back to nxt or something and let jimmy be out for a while and have a nice villain return or something.    but yea bloodline is officially over thank goodness
I’m sensing a bloodline civil war  Last year it was Bloodline battle   Now this year is the bloodline war and it’ll likely be between the rock bloodline vs Roman bloodline
A Bloodline civil war for War Games?
I can already see how this is gonna go. Solo is going to takeover and recruit one more. He’s going to kick roman reigns out which will make Roman jey and jimmy form a new group to take them out
We tried to warn him bruh we tried to freakin warn him
Tama once said he'll step in the ring with the usos not Roman js
Solo Sikoa is overrated he didn't even have a match at WrestleMania you failed at helping Roman Reigns retain his title in bloodline rules since crown Jewel you have been on quite the losing streak of your own. At least Jimmy had a match at WrestleMania I'm not on board with this storyline
This was awesome well solo and tonga
Solo Sikoa has the charisma of Voltorb the Poke Ball
lmao they have to censor their idiot crowd saying the S word?? This company is an absolute joke.
Jimmy: _I think I really, _*_really_*_ owe my brother a serious apology._
Solo brought in Tama Tonga. I can see him bringing in Jacob & Zilla Fatu to form his own Bloodline which then forces Roman, the Usos, & Sami Zayn to reunite for a War Games match at Survivor Series.
Bloodline gimmick is stupid
These new guys are corny
Solo is not a good wrestler he’s just a worst and a ripoff version of umaga . Umaga will always be better .
Oh, the irony. Paul can't use his phone to help him.
During Backlash, Tonga and Sikoa are going to cost Jey the world title and start to beat him up and then Jimmy makes the save. It’s going to look like the USOs have the upper hand until Fatu intervenes.
Solo has taken the tribal chief throne!! Per the elders!! 😅
Whats with the sound cut outs
I didn’t hear him say he’s the new tribal chief he’s not even as good a Roman yet
We got the story telling you didn’t have to explain it 🤦🏾‍♂️
FATU coming next with solo setup by the final boss! Roman gets usos back they have civil war while Paul Heyman goes to new best thing Bronn Breakker as his protector because we all know he got that dog in him! Talk about Paul's great new meal ticket hopefully Bronn has family or family friends son's in wrestling to kliq up with to take bloodline & bloodline 2.0 on!
They giving Solo the push they couldn't give to Umaga because of Umaga's passing and I'm here for it lowkey
This what Jimmy get for being a B turning on his bro😂
The son of quite posdibly the most frightening human being on earth Haku
Who da Fook is that new guy???
Yes Rock and roman
A bold move Cotton.  Though while I applaud Solo for stepping up it's really hard seeing him ever filling Roman's shoes.  Some are suggesting the Rock as the new Chief but I doubt that too, as fantastic as he looks he's still too old and too busy with his many other pursuits to commit to that kind of role.
Who has more ink Solo or jimmy or jey comment below in reply
Gonna be bloodline civil war survivor series 4 vs 4, my. Prediction anyway, Rock Roman reigns and the Usos vs solo, Tama, Jacob and Zilla
Cody Rhodes 400k bloodline 700k
Now can he do what his brother has done
Did anybody listen to what The Rock has said earlier and Monday night raw is anybody listening. In the beginning they said that solo will be the number one tribal Chief they've been sending from the beginning
Way to go solo
Looks like Solo is getting the next push and I don’t really get it. He looks like a landscaper you’d see at the gas station at 5AM. Dude needs some actual ring gear, a new haircut, and he needs to ditch the cringy grunting thing he does. It’s not the 80s; all that screaming and growling every sentence you say just looks stupid.
The bloodline civil war!  Jacob, Zilla aren’t far behind
Now the big brother see what it feels like to be betrayed by the little brother
Wwe is back after 20 years
I have watched this about 20 times. What goes around comes around
I might not agree with the way the bloodline handles business I have to admit seeing the younger cousin appear and part of the next storyline
Roman returning as a babyface to stop Solo is going to be great.
I just hope they don’t turn Roman reigns into some corny punchline
staged
Fin and tama og bullet club and aj with the good brother's. Are the bullet club taking over wwe???
Tama going to take over nd he going be the one to fight roman. Theyre finally doing this.  Get ready for tama nd his brothers now.
I think that Jimmy needs to bury the hatchet with his brother Jay and team up with Cody Rhodes and go after the bloodline
Call romen
ROMAN JUST TAKE YOUR L AND STOP MAKING EXCUSES..U LOST END OF STORY, LITERALLY
Is solo going with jey
Jimmy I love you to you
Nope
Yeet
Hi
Michael and Fredo, the WWE version.
Yeet
Has he actually ever won a match? 😂😂
Solo is not the new tribal chief, but he got his orders from someone who he believes to be the "new" tribal chief, and it's not Roman. It's most likely Rock. Setting it up for the Rock n Roman match we didn't get. Looks like Solo and Toma Tanga have chosen sides tho and they want Paul Heyman to stick with em.
This looks like the Wolfpack storyline. I just hope they don’t bloat it like WCW did. It had some legs but certain things didn’t fit.
I love you Fredo...  Will Roman will turn face and join forces with Jay against Tomma and Solo? Will Jimmy take some injury time off and come back months later to save Jay?
No. They are just trying to adopt the dumbasses online’s take. If he had hit Cody and gone for the cover, Seth would have disrupted the count. This “long term storyline”angle doesn’t make sense
Paul showing why he's already a hall of famer. he's a master of his trade.
They better up Solo's character by a lot in this attempt because he is the least likeable character atm.
what took so long jimmy not even on jey or solo level
Paul is goated. Also, the chick in the background with the Hogn cosplay 😂
New age of the wild sumoans
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WITH A CHAIR 2 YOUR FACE. SOEONE HAS TO PAY
Please add Zilla and Jacob fatu ASAP
Toma will screwed the entire bloodline think about it you have 3 of 4 original members of bullet club in wwe now they're gonna form bullet club wwe. It's coming, Finn, aj, Cody and brandi, good brothers with Mia and Toma Tonga
How many matches has solo won as of late?   : )
B.        A.       Where is Jacob
This is where Jey comes to rescue his twins. What did Jimmy do to deserve this?
This Goes To Show Everyone.....Cody Winning Will Eventually Backfire......Cos The Bloodline Still Runs Everything.....Even Without The Belt......We Accept Accountability.....n We'll Comeback....Even Stronger.....Roman Out....
"No Yeet" is jus "Yoink"
Wait until Zilla or Jacob come on board
Roman ruled by fiat; Solo will rule by Law  And "Win your Ones" shall be the whole of the Law
Solo is now as your new tribal chief which that's mean he in charge of being Part with the bloodline since tami tonga had joined alongside with him Paul Heyman got a look on his face is priceless  Jimmy uso will be leaving from them and gonna end up reunited with jey over at Monday night raw  Established themselves as a babyface The usos
Paul needs to get out of the Bloodline. I hope Jimmy and Jey team up against the Bloodline.
Jimmy got a lot making up to do for his twin&the fans for the damage he created
6:51 - Paul Heyman with the performance of a lifetime.
This family is so overrated
Roman comes back as the good guy now to save Paul Heyman 🤣🤣🤣 pretty dope🔥🔥
The end on the blood line, and a new one starts.Rock,Solo,and Tonga. VS Rom,Jey,and Jimmy. Time for Paul to Call up Brock.
jimmy is to goofy to be a heel
He can be the Head of The Thumb to the Neck Loser.
solo doesn't look intimidating to me
That No from heyman was top tier 🙌🏽😂
Looks like Tama has been training … not so much Solo…lol!
What’s with the sound?
Roman  brings Jimmy and Jey together as The Original Bloodline. The Rock brings, Solo, and Tama together as the New Bloodline. Wrestlemania 41: Roman vs. the Rock Jey vs Solo …winner is the Tribal Chief  Jimmy vs Tama revenge match, Bloodline Rules
Solo Sikoa has the most losing streak in the bloodline
Paul Heyman funny asl
Paul Heyman is in on this. Trust Me.
I think Reigns just turned babyface when Heyman said Roman Reigns into his cell phone before Solo ripped it out his hand and stomped on it and it will be civil war Reins Jimmy and Jey vs Solo and Tonga maybe the Rock helps Solo and it sets showdown between Rock and Reigns at Summerslam or next years Wrestlemania for Trible Cheif rights and the old timers will be brought in to pick what side they choose
Solo is the tribal heir so with Roman away he is the chief now.
Jey and Jimmy reunite, tag match between Solo/Tonga vs the Usos, Jacob Fatu joins Solo, then Zilla helps the USOs. I like this New Era already
Please let Jimmy be ok
Keep it coming Triple H!
Paul please 🙏 don't go back it's safer if you don't stay away from  solo
Some guy was flipping them off when they were walking out. Lol.
Hopefully rock creates new bloodline vs Rocks bloodline
Just like that, the bloodline is no more.
I'm sorry but this stinks. Solo hasn't won in months. Who is he to act like this?
I mean, ya can’t now push the dude who’s lost for a year, as the leader
Wow the entire AEW roster is better than Solo Sikoda
I would flat out merc my brother for betraying me like that. Would not matter when or where.
They should bring Zilla Fatu to wwe and add him too
Solo said he's the new tribal chief
"Who da fook is dat guy?" 🧐
Brock will destroy this 2 like a baby
When Solo was screaming at Roman at Mania that was the hint.
Like Paul heyman said at wrestlemania 39 “We’re only in the 3rd inning with this story”.. boyyy he wasn’t lying
With Roman missing and Jimmy out, and now Tama in, nows a great time for Solo to be pushed like crazy
The  final boss  giving the orders setting up Roman to turn face.
Awesome. Bloodline story is the best one in years. Hopefully this keeps going.
At this point they need their own league/company there is almost too many of them, when they have to split them between two brands and pull some of them off tv
TEAM PRIME
Can’t wait for Roman to come back and see how he is gonna deal with this
Whose side will The Rock be on?
finally Jimmy is out... thank God
The Bloodline is the new Bullet Club I'm calling it now
What’s crazy is having solo debut and be an undefeated monster and have him on a John cena level losing streak and him being mad about losing lol
YES YES YES YES
I guess The Final Boss, while filming The Smashing Machine, is behind all this.
Yep, I guess this is how you'd keep the bloodline going
Remember year ago Cody said if he wins the title the bloodline will turn on each other
New ouija macc and Darby o trill album goes hard
Bro somebody get this dog on a leash Solo never won a secondary championship acting like that 😂
Solo did it for The Rock 😂😂 whole time the final boss tryna take the tittle of the tribal chief
Im so glad solo did this. The USOS will rise again. Believe that!!
Wait, isn't Solo on a losing streak like 20 matches long?
The Rock will lead the Bloodline. Roman as a baby face will join Uso’s and Cody at survivor series setting up a Rock vs Roman Wrestlemania. Possibly giving Roman the title back or a title anyway.
The babyface reunion of The Bloodline is going to be amazing 🔥
Finally Toma Tonga is in wwe, i hope Jacob fatu is next. I'm hyped to see where the bloodline is going.
Roman will be out for a while bcoz of his sickness
Jimmy should get jacob  fatu and zilla
A tamed Tama Tonga is crazyyyy
The self proclaimed tribal chief... what a joke
So is not a big time guy and never will be. He's too fat and has zero tank.
Roman is gonna come out and challenge the bloodline in a year or so. It's gonna be a handicap match until the pay per view against solo and his brother. And then Dean Ambrose is gonna come out and help beat them. How great would that be?
Okay so make him the chef and make cody win in wrestlemania....Wwe you're not only making the biggest mistakes ever, but yu are seemingly just trying to kill wwe.
Well didn’t jay tell jimmy they was gone turn on him
Looks like it’s the end for Bloodline since Roman is not there.  And Solo tribal chief  No Thanks! You’re not main event material
I wonder if his brother or brothers are going to join the bloodline with him.
I can’t wait till jimmy’s come back 😎 yeet2
Roman an usos vs solo an his crew in a Samoan civil war . Roman vs solo for head of table
Battle of Tribal Chiefs and Usos vs Solo and Tonga
Rey Mysterio Jr. Said it better when he mentioned to Santos Escobar that "Karma" Well the same could be said to Jimmy Uso, Now karma came back to haunt Jimmy Uso. It looks like "The Bloodline" has to upgrade their unit.
That is who with solo and why he doing this to Jimmie 😢
Isn’t that haku son
Never woulda thought Tama was going to sign with WWE. Money definitely talks lol.
F this guy. Solo is garbage
its so the usos get back together again and go the the tag belts
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 🤩👍🏾❗
hex no
The tribal chief never won a match by himself. Big deal
I've wanted this for so long
This is great
When you don’t pay your Amazon workers enough😂
I see a Uso reunion coming💯
Sikolo vs Tama ‼️🤔🤔🤔🤔
Reigns lost, too! Solo said failure is unacceptable! I want to see Reigns talk to him!
Sikolo, Tama, Jacob Fatu ‼️🔥💯
Now for the Usos to reunite
TAMA TONGA ‼️💯🔥
We if Jimmy never betrayed His brother Jay and Jay would be by his side now and I Blame Jimmy for his Misconduct
They said Solo was going to take over but we didn't know when. Here it is.
Bro where is Jey I’m back on jimmy’s side now 🤦🏾
Poor Jimmy he just keeps getting screwed at every turn.
Is this dude Samoan ?? Part of the family or who is he
Jacob Fatu is coming next... Bloodline story will be better than ever
Will never forgive H for what he did. Handing that noob dbag who is the lowest on the totem pole in every aspect possible the undisputed title. Did he think ppl would forget that had WWE handed it to the dbag last year he would have lost it less than 12 hrs later when lesnar went off script and beat his a** and put him on the sidelines AGAIN for many weeks, a dude who has a couple tag matches and singles matches and just reached a year in WWE but yaaaa makes total sense to end the longest title run in the past 35 years and 4th longest run in WWE history with that cry baby b****.
This could be the push Solo needs to become a great, in the ring and on the mic.   If Roman can come back from "sufferin succotash" then Solo can become a killer on the mic.
Put down thoses ones down now he’s no longer the head of table
The new "Samoan Swat Team"
Solo is a dud..he'll never be the chief of anything. He's just not good on the mic at all and he's a jobber now
More bloodline in Japan
This why do not see roman reigns back solo sikoa is a new tribal chief
Boooo
"Accepts accountability" but makes other people do it for him and can't say it himself
was hoping for Jacob Fatu or even Zilla, but i guess this will do for now.
Looks like Paul Heyman is a prisoner in the bloodline
Jimmy gonna come back as a face
Whoa😮
Blood like family members are getting annoying
Bloodline is fine  Bloodline is mine -solo
Paul heyman is the GOAT at acting
Solo "I Love you Brother" sound like Rikishi "I did it for da Rock" type vibes
Bloodline Civil War.
Jacob fatu needs to debut soon for the bloodline
"Shawn dropped the ball." - HHH
Triple h is cooking a filet mignon in these scripts
New era of WILD Samoans has begun!!!
Tama Tonga!!!!!🔥
whoever shouted “you can’t wrestle big brother” killed me
Jimmy did awesome selling this beating
Does Jey come back and join Jimmy now?
So Tama is now Solos, Solo?
This was Solos KO moment. An absolute brutal destruction of someone to show absolute dominance
I never thought I see solo sikoa turn Jimmy uso
Today on "19 Usos and Counting"...
Noted!
I'd have Solo go on a winning rampage untill Summerslam or the next Wrestlemania. Have Solo find out Heyman has been speaking with Roman Reigns. Have Solo destroy Heyman in the ring and right before Solo is leaving the ring with Heyman laying flat Brock Lesnars music hits. @wwe
Solo is outhere acting like a mob boss
The new up and coming Tama Tonga is going to wreak havoc. Now the next thing they're going if Jimmy, reunited with Jey Uso, then the returning of Roman Reigns at SummerSlam.
What's crazy about this is that even though tama tonga is not blood his father haku is not blood but they are from the same island as the Anoi family. Tonga was also apert of the bullet club with Cody .. so we might see a storyline there.
I wouldn't call him the tribal chief he hasn't been given that nor has he took it from Roman
The Rock is making his first move. Solo works for The Rock.
His win / loss record is too trash for me to take him seriously 😂
I definitely like how solo honors his uncle Umaga
Sikoa and Tonga attacked at Jimmy Last night
Welp... looks like a good ol lapse break....
Need to get Hikuleo and Jacob Fatu over there asap. Idc what kind of contracts they're under, buy them out and make the Bloodline deadlier than ever.
Toma tonga is so good he deserves a Great push
If Roman has leukemia like he says then Soko would take over
Bad writing in my opinion, now I would understand if they did this ok so the Samoans are a tribe, tribes have warriors and enforcers (solo sikoa) and just like Paul said, you have to be held accountable so beings that solo just did that Roman comes back and chastises solo bc he loses and solo chastises roman for losing and they get in a feud leading to a match for the position of tribal chief and solo wins and cuts Roman out of the bloodline, taking Paul hostage and now Roman is in a kind of a redemption/banished king storyline and realizes what it was like for everyone else who had to deal with Roman’s tyranny and he turns face
Nah, solo is just not it. He’s not that great of a wrestler, his mic skills are non existent, and he’s way too one dimensional. Hes easily the most dislikable thing about the bloodline.
Bring back the New Somoan Swat Team !!
The most silent ones can also be the most dangerous ones 👌🏽
WWE creative has done it again with the post WM vibes being high asf. It’s time for solo to have another single’s title run
Solo didn’t want this at all. You can tell. But I think it’s a great storyline.
They didn't have to do Jimmy like that.
I think we're in for a trial war fare rock vs roman I think Rock is having some play in this
and now I’m interested on what Roman reigns will do
The look on Solo SIkra face says everything!😂 He been in that 😡 character!😂
Cody Cody Cody!😂
"NO YEET" -JIMMY USOOOO!😂
I hope Jimmy goes on a decent solo run now that he isn’t tied to the Bloodline.. solo vs Jimmy could be a good match
Anyone else thinks this story is only progressing because the fans on social media are practically making this up and putting it together 😭
This is like the TV series Loki. Roman would be he who remains. When he who remains lost the timeline starts branching off and chaos begins. Well Roman lost and now chaos begins within his family. Roman might have went on a power trip but it was to keep order and to quote he who remains "if you think I'm bad wait till you see my variants" which in Roman case wait till his family comes and causes chaos. The only one who can bring order is the tribal chief or the rock. Which sets up the Rock vs Roman on who will be the tribal chief and restore order within the bloodline or solo just become the new tribal chief and the faction goes from being a top belt faction to a mid card champion faction which solo will become us champion.
We want Jacob and Zilla Fatu in WWE!
So now we have tama tonga, Cody, aj, the oc, and Finn. CAN WEEEE PLEASEEEEEEE DO AN AMERICAN VERSION OF THE BULLET CLUB PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE
For those wondering about why Solo is pointing out the losing winning matter, makes sense, because if you're failing and losing, then there's a pressure, that though we didn't see much, you can especulate it might have been there from the Tribal Chief's part and the rest of the members. Solo was the enforcer, the key to success in most of Roman's defenses yet he was failing when he was on his own. He grew tired and not willing to tolerate a failure that wouldn't be  tolerated if it was him who failed, specially when if you look back, the success of the others was because of Solo.
Favorite wwe solo sikoa now
Need to give Jacob Fatu an opportunity if he wants it. Not a more perfect enforcer out there.
I miss my Tribal Chief already ☝️
Bloodline Civil War, Let's Go!!
Solo in a leadership role? Lol nah
Solo: "Losing and winning matters." Also Solo: 0-34 after beating Cena
Let's go Solo ☝🏾
🔥🔥🔥
Solo don't look like a tribal chief......he looks more like a bouncer.
Solo Sikoa is a idiot .. no Tribal Chief for him. Roman Reins has a flair about him... persona that garners himself respect .. Solo Sikoa doesn't have any of that... he's a looser. This is so hilarious ... scripted and staged
Tama tonga would have been better working with the judgment day or cody. He's a excellent singles guy he doesn't need a stable let alone not being able to link back up with og bullet club guys
Very interested to see where this storyline goes.
❤
How many times has Paul had his phone destroyed 😂
I don’t get why he blame jay he wasn’t the only that messed up because solo he didn’t get the job done either n the rock didn’t get the job done either so why blame Jay
Hopefully the USOs come back
The jay and Jimmy are getting back together as a tag team the usos
I was expecting them to use Tama Tonga at WM, nice to see him on Smackdown
Like I said, this is why I hate wrestling fans. The next few months are going to be very predictable. Cody Rhodes will not lose I believe l a knight should’ve won that title. So we could’ve got the rock versus Roman reigns and we could’ve had a bloodline Civil War at this point. I’m not interested because the fans of ruined it. We have a boring champion now and this storyline could’ve been much better even if the rock would’ve won the title.
As I said the new attitude era
Solo i love u my boy but in that case roman reings should hit u with 80 superman punches and 105 spears for all the matches youve lost
When Roman comes back, I highly believe it’s gonna be for him to put solo over..Roman might even come back as a face who knows
A whiny Roman reigns lost and it's about time now you smashed Jimmy but the rest of y'all need smashed cuz y'all let him lose have a nice day
if he is the blood line will spiral out of control everybody is game even paul heyman !
sadness, shock and then....revenge. don't mess with Paul Heyman. We've been down this road before😮
Happy to see toma tonga in wee ive been waiting when he was gonna come. Him and hes family been ruling new japan
Who is Solo to talk about losing? He's the biggest loser on the roster lmao
Mafia Style!
Street chump.
Solo only win one match
Well... theres a new member for The O.C.... now just need Balor to step in and lead it
Tomma Tonga Haku's son??if that's truly his son be afraid Haku was a bad mamma jamma DON'T take my word for it go watch wrestler interviews there were alot of people who were afraid of him👍
Paul Heyman is the 🐐 at what he does.   No one comes close. Every line, every facial expression is unparalleled in the history of the WWE. He makes every promo he’s in remarkable. What a legend
Bout time they letting solo shine
THE FINAL BOSS IS CALLING THE SHOTS NOW
Chuu I can’t wait till Jacob fatu gets their and see how it plays out now
I'm so terrified of the guy who is currently 0-36 since the Blood Money ppv
Cody better stay out of Bloodline way now 🤣
Speak English clown lol
So looks like roman is gonna return sometime in the coming weeks to confront solo which leads to solo turning on roman and Setting up sola vs roman feud
Solo couldn’t fight his way out of a paper bag
But they need to put jimmy and jey back together.  Jimmy its time to turn completely dark
Solo you stepped up☝☝☝☝☝
Roman why did u lose
I like where this is going
They have to bring in Tanga loa and Hikuleo.
They was going to turn on Jimmy eventually yep I knew it was coming
Where does Fatu fit in? As in Jacob Fatu!
Paul heyman stupid he really gonna call Roman while he right next to solo
Roman did the USOS wrong Jimmy flip on Roman because he got tired of the disrespect and jey team up with his brother and they beat Roman and solo and Jimmy flip on jey the rock team up with Roman and Cody finish the story and now solo started a new story of the bloodline 💯💯💯
Now this is a storyline. Brother vs brother. Tribe vs tribe Chief vs Chief 😮😮😮❤❤❤
So lame get to a new story line
Jimmy and Jay team up again maybe?
It’s gonna be a new story for the usos
2 more punks
Solo is like watching paint dry.
Jimmy and Jey slowly reunited
We all know who Solo is referring to. It's the 'People's Champion'.
Only difference is solo is the the only that didn't lose at WM.
Babyface Roman incoming
I am thinking Rock Has assumed the mantle of Tribal Chief. Building a new bloodline with Solo and Tama. I do wonder where Jacob Fatu fits in, reinforcement for Roman or join the new Chief.
I told yall solo the next tribal💯💯💯💯
Who is tama
Do I havent watched wrestling in 20 years can yall tell me the dats and times raw and smackdown come on now and what channels? Tgis whole bloodline storyline has gotten me interested in watching again. Thanks 💯
Wow
The fact he snatched the phone from Heyman and broke it when he attempted to call Roman means he betrayed Roman as well.. should be interesting when he returns
Wrestling seems like something P Diddy would enjoy 😂
Next u,p an Usos reunion and tag match against Sikoa/Tonga.
They gotta chill wit the censoring, it's annoying
I smell a civil war brewing
This should’ve happened on raw the day after wrestlemania
TAMA TONGA
And Solo is the top loser.
I acknowledge you solo ☝️
solo, roman, tonga vs usos and zilla
Paul tried to call Roman Reign and solo stomped the phone. This is getting good
The Samoa 🇼🇸 swat team lives again 😮!!!!😂
Here’s the new storyline:  Solo takes the bloodline to darker places, while Roman remains absent.  His only correspondence is through the tribal chief, who through fear shifts allegiance to Solo.  Jimmy is left broken, and picked up by Jey, who is Solo’s new target, only to beat jey.  Roman makes first appearance since WM40 at survivor series to confront Tribal Chief Solo.  Faceoff tension and stare down.  Solo tells him he’s out, because he’s been gone, Tonga and Solo take on Roman.  Jimmy and Jey come to rescue, stage is set for WM41, Solo V Roman for head of the table.
Bring Tongo Loa next
Next is the bloodline vs. Bloodline Wolfpack just like nwo vs.nwo Wolfpack fighting each other just watch ⌚
Tama Tonga is one of founding members of the original Bullet Club in NJPW. He's actually a veteran in the industry. But I doubt most wwe fans don't know him. To them he's like a young superstar
Finally, Toma..
Jimmy is Fredo. I think war games will be Rock Solo Tama & possibly jacob fatu vs og BL roman usos and sami! 🔥🔥
The Usos and babyface Roman vs Solo, Tama, and The Rock is gonna hit hard
Good way to revamp the bloodline storyline. This could go so many different ways, please please don't mess this up, bring in the Samoan warewolf Jacob fatu
Send those arrogant bloodline idiots to AEW they will get the final SmackDown put on them
I’m calling it now..Usos reunite and now it’s obvious who they’re gonna have to stop🤝🏾
Just when ppl thought that The Bloodline was over it’s just getting rolling,.. again.
I can not wait when roman reigns spear solo
Solo will do it for The Rock
Now it will be Jimmy and Jey versus sogo and the other person
Hey, Paul, is your phone insured?
I knew there's a backstabbing!
Lmao. Hoe much more are they going to milk this story to death. Thought they have multi billions to play with and this is the only story they put on TV? 😆 🤣
I love paul saying cody rhodes thank you i hate hearing romans name out his mouth lol
Should of pushed Solo like Batista and J like Randy
What a good time to have a pop 2 psa 10 solo sikoa rookie card lol! Go solo! Welcome tama!
Solo is boring.
And this is what puts Jay Back with jimmy 💯
Tama Tonga wow I never expected that….
I knew Solo was breaking up the Bloodline when he hugged Jimmy.....classic scene from The Godfather movie franchise.
Every time somebody in the Bloodline talks besides Jimmy, I can’t take my eyes off of him & his facial reactions….
Usos baby face reunion incoming
WWE new era? They must mean WWE new error! first 20 minutes, nothing but talk. HHH has turned WWE into one boreing show.
Solo, Jacob and Tama vs. Roman, Jimmy, and Jay at War game. 😮
I definitely thought Toma Tonga would get a bigger pop. I'm glad he's here though
I would like to see Jey and Roman clear things up.
Everyone's a boss until the boss returns.
So solo going to to talk about losing has consequences when's his last win  that's right I can't remember
This is great and I’m glad no one saw it coming. The addition of Tonga and bloodline civil war, with the final boss and tribal chief.
Solo if u love him so much why did u bash his head in with a steel chair
solo not stupid.
Jacob Fatu will be next.
The son of Haku... the world should be terrified.
We cooking again ☝🏻☝🏻
Solo picking up reigns mannerisms is the icing on the cake🤣
Dem Samoans tho...❤🔥
Very Godfather 2. Love it.
Tama in the E! Let’s goooo 🔥
Technically even if they were saying Jey Uso in the storyline what's the problem and they're putting all the blame on him contradicts taking responsibility don't you think Paul? I get it though the storyline was going for it was to Swerve us where they were going to take responsibility but put the blame on Jey Uso.
This was awesome.
the rock is the new chief. solo took his order. the rock is the one who stepped in roman's spotlight and i think he was  salty when roman made him acknowledge him. and he also pinned cody in that tag match. triple h new era is amazing!
Jacob Fatu siding with Jey, and Roman? Roman probably not gonna be all for this new Bloodline
So roman and usos vs solo fatu tonga
I think they will give solo big push with big wins lead up to next year wrestlemania  have solo vs roman turn roman back to good guy
New tribal Chief I think Roman might have something to say about that.
tongas takented wasted right off the bat in his debut
waiatimg tongas talent by lining him up with solo damm bri wwe is becoming trash again
Solo Sikoa obvious didn't care one bit if his parents were watching and that he turned on his brother, Jimmy, and that they were very upset seeing that Who knows if Jimmy's neck is broker and if his twin brother, Jay, was watching this?
Hostile takeover this might be and so many paths they could go with it, its safe to say a new chapter has begun in the Bloodline Saga.
Now we need Royal Rumble to have Balor, AJ Styles, Good Brothers, even Cody, with now Tama Tonga in the ring, and throw up the "Too Sweet" with one another.. A Bullet Club reunion for all.. Cause you know, your 4-Life..
The bloodline is recruiting now. The Rock is in charge and so now Roman Reigns will take charge of the good team and recruit people. I think he will recruit Cody, Jey, KO and possibly Sami Zayn. It'll be a bloodline civil war
oh..NOW the 8 month loser wants to talk about consequences for losing.....
If tama their then that means he can gight Roman since they had beef years ago
Blood Line Civil War
Let's not forget we still got zilla fatu on his way
When you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas
If the rock is behind this, this could set up something big. Replacing Roman because he couldn't finish the job.
To be honest with as many family members they have this stable can keep going like they do the bullet club
Roman is gonna end up the good guy. Rock is the bad guy. Roman will team up with Jimmy Jey vs The Rock, Solo, and Tonga
Real talk though, Jimmy has been getting away with being a goof ball for a long time now. Messing up, taking actions without Roman's approval, interfering when isn't told to. Yeah he's had this coming.
I was waiting for this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jacob fatu just signed with the wwe he’s going to be next to join solo
Solo your nothing more than a Dollar Store version of Tazz.
Tonga is a way better choice than jimmy
Helluva time to be Samoan in wrestling. lol.
Wow didn't expect that. Solo creating his own Bloodline? Hopefully they'll sign Jacob Fatu he's a bruiser who can fly. This could be great
"I know it was you Fredo!"
Are we gonna pretend that Solo has not won a match since beating cena and has lost every match since 😂😂
If you did not hear what Paul Heyman said to the phone it looks like he is taking notes LOL
So, now The Bloodline evolves into Solo, Tama Tonga, and Jacob Fatu - the next logical step, hopefully, is getting Roman, Jimmy, and Jey back on the same page and having an “Old Blood” vs “New Blood” match at SummerSlam or WM next year 🤞🏻🤞🏻
Go to show you blood really ain’t thicker than water 😂
Paul Heyman casually watches an entire beatdown but now all of a sudden hes like 5:14  I get its the finisher but it's just funny
Its probably the Rock giving orders
Is going to be bloodline vs bloodline
The new Reign of Solo Sikoa is here!! Tribal Chief Solo is Here!!
The next War Games
I have a gut feeling that Jacob Fatu make his WWE debut during Jey Uso vs Damian Priest title match. Jacob Fatu attacks Jey cause him to lose the match.
Bloodline got what they deserved ❤💯
In TOW SENTENCES, Cory literally did what the other guys don't. Told you who this guy is and why you should care.
I'm sorry but Solo and Haku's kid doesn't make a faction, even with Paul. That's just a tag team with a manager...
Finally solo can take over now.
Jacob fatu is next
Solo is now free
Love this new energy 🙌🏽💪🏽
Two factions of “Bloodline”… blood will be spilled. One led my Romain. The other by Rock. Romain may be a heel with babyface backing.
Solo acting as if he isnt on a god awful losing streak.
Solo is like watching paint dry. Terrible in-ring and worse on the mic....IMO
I have a feeling Paul is behind this.
Now can i please get RR Paul and the Rock walking out to their cars then out of nowhere a black limo hits both of them with the driver revealing himself to be Rikishi with a shirt that says I DID IT FOR THE DYNASTY I DID IT FOR My USOs
Consequences and repercussions😂
Its like the Nexus all over again, but this time the "Bloodline". How Wade Barrett (Roman Reigns) led the group, so now CM Punk( Solo sikoa) wants to lead.
I don’t know how they keep making this storyline interesting
Tama Freakin Tonga  Or Tonga Freakin Rollins
I was wanting jey and jimmy back but with solo also.  Jey and Jimmy will be back together.  And probably fight as tag against solo and tonga.
Why is this storyline still going...?
So is Zilla revving up?
Nahhhh Put Finn , The Good Brothers, and Tama Tonga back together lol
Paul sells it brilliantly
Rock,Solo,& Tonga vs Roman & the Usos somewhere down the road.
Roman loss so.thry shouldn't be taken out on jimmy
Look at the smirk on Jimmy's face.  Paul Heyman is sounding like a face promo.  The way things went down here was very interesting.
Its the Rock the new tribal chief.
In a perfect world , they would build up Solo so roman can fight him
And this is coming from a guy who just keeps on losing 😂
This is Romans Face turn. Bloodline is going to grow, then clash,,, in a bloodline rules match.
Finally Tama makes his debut. Great freaking wrestler
Ok I like where this is headed
Solo: *loses 30+ matches* Roman: "Aye, that's cool!" Roman: *Loses one match* Solo: "Look at me, I'm the captain now"
Paul heyman has has some Luke Skywalker worthy noooo’s lately and I love it
Solo sikoa look uncle umaga
Solo’s hostile takeover is hilarious considering he’s been losing too and he didn’t even have a match at WrestleMania 😂💀
This has been one of the best story lines in WWE history.. The Samoan Bloodline has been very successful in professional wrestling history. Just imagine how many more brothers or cousins could come to WWE.
They should have a Solo win more matches on thebmain roster to justify that reason for turning lol
So now he’s going to start winning matches?? 😂🤣
He has a losing streak
Ɓy solo turning om jimmy that mean the uses might get back to gather
😮 Jimmy you might as well get back with your brother.
Well that probably just pushed jimmy straight to Jey
This made no sense Solo's been 0 and 50 ever since WWM 39 he should be the one kicked off the Bloodline smh
On the low WWE has 3 of the original members of Bullet Club on the roster
Plot twist. Wat if Roman agrees with solo, an starts taking orders from solo
Solo, Tonga now bring in Fatu
well this makes forget how lackluster raw was
Solo knows losing...
Ain’t that the same dude that styles thought was LA hopping outta the crowd?
Haku and Fatu (Rikishi) where the tag team the Head Shrinkers!!
Losing has consequences. Solo's tribal chief has him brutalizing his loved ones as punishment.
Tama Tonga is even Samoan it doesnt make sense.
Jacob Fatu is coming
Solo 0-37 it got to his head
jey is not going to let this stand no way!!!!!! the uso brothers are back !!!!
Solo murked J.J. like a Menace II Society cast member.
"Call Roman" as if this isn't live on tv
I'm liking this story
Even though it’s contradictory for Solo to be talking about Jimmy losing when he’s been losing matches himself, this creates a whole new chapter for the Bloodline that will lead to another civil war style match.
No way bloodline breaks up
It was cool seeing toma tonga!
I assume Jacob Fatu rounds out the new faction? Gotta say, Solo as the head of a faction seems premature, Tama is more qualified at this point, unless Roman is still there. Heyman as their unwitting hostage is great
Roman said months ago solo will be next in line.
This dx after Shawn lost a mania type ish papa H cooking
We were literally told he would be
Well now there's no more blood in the bloodline
It's about time
So is Romen next because he lost also
Perfect way to turn Roman face again. Let the group think they can have the bloodline without him. Then he comes back to teach them all lessons.
The Bloodline is bigger than Roman Reigns himself. All you have to do is keep shifting the focus. Cody is the champion no doubt about it, but it seems like the Bloodline will remain the center of attention.
Not the phone!!!
bruhh. solo hasnt won a match in 2024. lol
Pretty sure jimmy has more wins than solo 😂😂😂
Finally solo might get a push
I see what's about happen. Jimmy's gonna come to his brother's rescue. They are going to fight Solo and Haku son. Watch
5:43 🤣 😂😂 Paul truly is the best
Bloodline too deep
The return of the USOs is in the horizon
Jimmy made his bed
Solo becomes MITB this year
Well this means jey is winning some championship soon
Paul Heyman is one of the best wrestling managers in history, but he just doesn't fit with in  The Bloodline. He looked great when he managed Brock Lesnar or guys similar to him.
They can't complain because they always cheat to win😂
That was dumb. Makes no sense
Let me answer the question why? Solo most likely is the New Tribal Chief, and Roman pass the torch. We shall see
The fall of the bloodline has arrived.
Business is picking up!
Kind of silly keeping the bloodline thing going, when solo is the only one left
Solo couldn’t Wrestle His Way Outta Bounce House
Jimmy and Jey back together!!!!!!
Roman could have used the chair on both of them…
this is a literal game changer, aew can get their indy stars i’ll take my samoans 😂😂😂😂😂❤
So does this means Roman reigns is on Vacation ?
Solo can talk
Finn and AJ your boy is here
And just like that, Jimmy and Roman are baby faces
The Bloodline continues... To be best thing in WWE... WOW!!!!
nWO 2000
This is GOOD!!! 🔥
Yes! I've been waiting for this. Solo is finally unleashed. 😁
im waiting on fatu zilla to come into wwe fatu zilla will destroy solo
i smell jey and jimmy reunite vs solo & tonga
Jacob fatu probably shows up too to join them... roman gets the usos back... then it's time for war
I like this!!!!! I never seen it coming!!!
Hauku this is great thanky wwe
USOs getting back 😅
Solo puts a super team of Samoans together....roman returns with the sheild to take them down.
Dont lie, we all thought that was jey foe a sec.
so when can we expect Tanga Loa? (Tama Tonga's brother for those who might not know)
Yeah hasn’t Solo been jobbed out for months now?  😂
Corny corny
Solo like Rikishi  I did it for The Rock 2.0
Paul is very scared
I'm hoping that Jimmy is going to be ok even though I don't like him
Romans next. As solo said "losing and winning matter. So theres consequences to losing and consequences need change". So i think Romans going to get the "jimmy beat down as well". Then and only then will Solo become the new "head of the table".
Solo now has his own enforcer  🤣
Usos reuniting wm41 if lmao
They're basically setting up Reigns to have to stop Solo reign of terror when he comes back.
😂😂 This gives me that vibe when Shawn Michael lost to Stone Cold and a new DX was created
There's gonna be a Bloodline Bloodbath coming soon too much family drama 😂
Maybe the Tribal Chef; definitely not the Tribal Chief.
The guy who loses all the time is making changes 🤣🤣🤣
Dang, the Bloodline story will go on for years cause there's literally about a hundred of them! 😂😂😂
We've entered the multiverse
Remember Solo said the elders sent him
“We don’t blame the undertaker” yea what would you do against the legend anyway 🤣🤣🤣
Did anyone catch that Paul Heyman left someone out of they dont blame part of the speech. Paul Heyman did NOT  say they don't blame the Rock. They're still hinting at 7:28  the idea of  that Roman Reigns vs. The Rock.  The Bloodline is now doing the NWO storyline. Which will Solo , Tama Tonga be? NWO Wolf pack or NWO Hollywood. ?
It's 1998 all over again after HBK dropped the belt to Austin
The forbidden door has been blown away
They going to have roman take bloodline out one by one roxk beats cody then next years wrestlemania will be rock and roman
Collins just got lucky
Solo the next tribal chief
Jimmy loses once and Solo pretty much is whole main roster run 😂
Hey e Roman best of all times
Solo the next tribal chief
Well atleast the title is off these clowns. Seriously.
The blood line is thinning out get it? Blood thinner 😅😂😂
Great story building
Solo is boring why is he the leader now lol and he always loses 😂😂
Style the good brothers balor cody an now tonga hhh still the game cause the levels he running different level he basically doing the reverse wcw/wars he bringing in the core of bullet club the originals keeping them separated long enough to pull that real flex
The guy in the front row  "Who's that guy??"
Orders by the boss not by Roman but solo lost more times than Hasbro
Solo needs to quit wrestling and do something, anything else besides wrestling.
So basically Roman is going to come back this summer and destroy the bloodline.
Heyman whats with the lipstick?
I think solo vs roman at backlash for tribal chief
Solo is better when he is not on the mic. Please God no.
BAD BOI Tama tonga let's gooooooooo
Put the title on Tonga immediately! Cody isn't holding that for long 😭
A message from the tribal chief-“If you fail you will be punished!” 😮
This was a pretty stupid idea. especially with roman not there
Paul found the fountain of youth
THIS is the Solo we need! Now when Joseph debuts....its game over!
Shoulda been Fatu
WHY WAS THE FORESHADOWING SO REAL I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OMG
Solo is the knew Tribal chief
The blood line. TBL
Civil War is comin tonga solo and maybe is jacbo all apart of the rocks plan
Omg 👀🔥🔥🔥🔥..The Tongan Death Grip ...is Back !!!!!  💀  Awesome to see the Re-Birth of HAKU ✊🔱
Maybe Jey will reunite with jimmy and take ‘em down
Roman Solo and Tonga vs The Usos and the Rock....Jacob Fatu being the X Factor
Rock, Tonga and Solo vs Roman, Jimmy and Jay. Jacob interferes and sides with the Rock turning Roman and the Usos face. Book it...
I smell shield returning
If solo chief. The tribe is over
Don't forget, Triple H said in the media scrum after Mania that Roman Reigns is getting a bigger, better storyline. This all might be a part of it. Let them cook.
I LOVE IT😂😂😂😂
Is Solo supposed to be Roman Lesnar? 🤣🤣
JIMMY JEY.... VS  SOLO AND RANDOM SPANISH LOOKING GUY
I was there it was awesome
So it will be a new bloodline with solo, Tama and Jacob Fatu vs og bloodline with usos (back together) and a returning Roman. I say summerslam sounds about right
Its crazy that they not gonna let romain reigns get his rematch
Yeet? are we like back to 2020 again?
Is this the end of the bloodline?
You dropped the ball, now a vanilla midget is ruining the ratings the final boss has handed the wwe
Roman needs to turn face and come back
Please wwe dont try and make another midcard wrestler like solo relevant
Solo bloodline vs Roman Bloodline coming soon
I hate him that was so wrong
Nice one try and beat bad mine out of it.
Just when i thought The Bloodline storyline would fizzle out, they make it more appealing 😂
Everybody saying Solo on a losing streak lol he finna build the most dominant faction on SD and run it like Roman
I feel like the reaction to Tama Tonga was less than I expected. I hope he gets a chance to showcase his amazing talent
He feels like my 2k24 career mode character, tonga
He’s going to fight Roman for that spot. That’s why they were shocked. Roman didn’t relinquish it at WM Solo was screaming for him to get up. That’s where he smelled the weakness. That’ll be the storyline. Just like Jimmy lost, so did Roman and according to TTC something has to be done about that. Saw that here. We’ve seen it from RR taking out Jey2020, RR taking out Jim2020, Roman taking out Sami and anyone who loses in the BL. Roman will have his trials next.
No Solo
Solo the new tribal chief
Aka the bloodline B team
Things are getting spicy 😮
The day someone finally shakes Jimmy hand, the building is going to go crazier than Cody winning 🤣🤣🤣 bro been chasing a handshake forever
Oh Summerslam going to be jumping
Lazy booking
The Bloodline Wolfpack 👀
the one to the sky stand for solo now
Solos time to shine
This is like when HHH took over DX
I want solo as champion
I wanted a gun stun so bad 😅
Hiku son has arrived and I didn’t expect this to happen
Homage with the Umaga vibes.... haven't watched wrestling in YEARS, might have to get back into it the way it's going so far
lol this makes no sense
Next addition to solos group ys jacod fatu ya were getting a bloodline civil war and im here for it
Time to apologize and repent to your brother Jey.
And so the new story begins....The battle of who is the head of the table/tribal chief....
If Roman Reigns was on tonight SmackDown he’ll attack him and Jimmy both but now he made an example out of Jimmy and they’ll be coming after Jey they will probably interfere in his match against Damian Priest
So Usos reunite 😂
Solo is too serious
Solo is so cringey I’ll never buy into him.
Solo is a number one Butface.
3:26 “YOU TALK LIKE A 5TH GRADER!”
😂😂😂😂 the rock's team  bloodline civil war 😂😂😂
Paul  yelling no adds so more to it
All i see is that UMAGA in Solo
Interesting.
Solo next week: “I did it for the tribal chief!”
Oh My 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Solo💯
Jimmy coming back to team yeet?????
We just witnessed a blood transfusion.
Just when you thought internal conflict was done with the bloodline boom surprise. Loving this new Triple H running things era 💪🏼🔥
Wait til Jacob Fatu debutes
The Usos needs to come back as a tag team babyfaces & another tag team title run.
Cm punk heyman reunion?
Calling it right now. This dudes gonna injure someone in the ring.
The Bloodline…4…4…4…life! ☝🏻
Who else notice blue demon on the crowd 😅
Tama Tonga’s out of NJPW and here in WWE 👊🏼💯☝️
Why would Jey help Jimmy here? Should he just forget all that has happened with he and Jimmy these past several months? Jimmy is on his own for this feud, anybody who was on his side before... he betrayed. This is the time for Jimmy to step up as a singles competitor, become "Main Event Jimmy."
Hear me out, what if it’s not Solo?? I feel  like there’s a smidge of a swerve ? Or am I just on crack
Solo Corleone.  Jimmy playin the role of Fredo.  LOL!
lmao nooo wayy i gotta tune into wwe now lmao
Dude when Reigns comes back the pop is going to be ridiculous!!  Book it wwe Survivor Series War Games Roman,Jey,Jimmy, The Rock, vs Solo, Tonga, Jerimiah & Jacob Fatu This is where the rock turns on Roman and we get Roman redemption arc where he collides with the rock at wm41
Y they always turn on jimmy 🤦🏾‍♂️
Solo vs Roman?
Rip jimmy 😭😭😭
Wait till Jacob Fatu shows up... Be interesting to see how it all pans out.
Wow he uses his head a lot like his dad lol
I Love Paul Heyman!
I see the big picture, 2 special indie wrestlers coming to save Roman seat ;)
Seeing Tama Tonga in WWE is so wild to me.
When you heard haku kid you felt bad for jimmy
The Bloodline civil war just got more interesting. Will we see a Jimmy Uso face turn after this?
Paul Heyman’s facial reactions are gold 😂😂😂
Perfect storyline. Solo at his best. This faction is going to create chaos
Solo doesnt have enough clout to be THE GUY yet. He doesnt have enough wins or time. So what the bloodline is a tag team now, kinda whack!!!
This is gonna be interesting to see Roman vs solo current tribal chief vs supposed replacement tribal chief
Tongans and Samoans??
Wargames is definitely gonna be The Bloodline (Solo, Tanga Tonga, Jacob Fatu, & Zilla Fatu) Vs. The Samoan Dynasty (Roman Reigns, Jimmy & Jey Uso, & The Rock).  Then Roman & Solo have Tribal Combat at Royal Rumble for the Title of Tribal Chief, Roman wins, and Rock betrays Roman.  Then Roman & Rock have Tribal Combat at WrestleMania 41 to determine the true Head of the Table once and for all.
Frfr  Hopefully we get the down since day 1'z back,  UCE! FOR REAL FOR REAL We miss uso penitentiary Yeet  It's better and worth more than a Sami title rub  Gunther world heavyweight championship title run after a 5 year Damien priest run please
Oh jeez. Let's keep it going
Only a matter of time till Heyman exits
Let's have a blood in blood out. Jimmy vs solo. ☝🏽
The Bloodline B team. lol
Tama Tonga right where he rightfully belongs. Great debut.
YESS!!!! NOW BRING JACOB FATU AND ZILLA TO JOIN!!!!!
TAMA TONGAAAA!!!
I just don't care for the samoan stuff anymore. I want Roman back on The Shield. Bring The Shield back, Roman needs to be on a team with the boys again
Bloodline civil war, Roman jimmy and jey vs solo Jacob and Tonga
Jimmy face turn here we go
I love to see solo try punish roman lol roman remind solo how many times he lost
Cody hasn't defended anything yet. Has a to defend 28 times to beat Roman
Boring champs now
OH, DON’T COME RUNNING BACK NOW!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bloodline Phase 5 has started 🤣😂
Boring
Solo Sikoa says that losing has its consequences? Well I say to that remark, you’re one to talk about losing having its consequences Mr. nephew of the Samoan bulldozer, the late great Umaga! In other words, look who’s talking! This is coming from someone who has had a string of losses ever since destroying John Cena at Crown Jewel, for eight straight freaking months I might add for the record! LOL!
Who's the guy?
Incredible booking. Jacob Fatu coming next. Dont be surprised of Rikishi comes back for promos
This the first time in like 7 years Pauly H isn't with the wwe title. Paul lost more than anyone.
His "name" is Pudgy the Whale, and The Bloodline is Dead. Bury It. Racist Storyline anyway
☝🏽👹💯   Lives on      🥥
The Rock is going to be the one behind this and he is the nee Tribal Chief
I think this is the rocks doing.
OMG 😮
The Rock really ordered that.
Did Solo just kill Uso??
Losses have consequences, eh? I think that Solo and Tama will likely align with the only Bloodline member who didn't lose, and went 1-0 at WM 40, when he comes back. We gettin another Bloodline Civil War. OG Bloodline vs The Final Boss' Bloodline (Jey will likely be enticed by The Rock, but reunites with Jimmy and Roman instead)
TAMA TONGA OH SHI!!!!
Bruh idk why they keep getting rid of members they need to be in full strength and bring in more cousins along with with jey and Jimmy for Roman’s return
Clearly Roman will return as a baby face
Solo is here to stay!
TRASH AS USUAL
😢beautiful!!!
This fool almost slipped. His career would of been over.
Who cares
More of the bloodline trash members? 🥱
Them still putting the hand up is lame. He lost lol it’s suppose to be we the ones but it was Romans lead on that but I guess ha This is also a good angle to get the USOs back together so that’s cool.  YEET YEET YEET!!!!
Not even haku real son he's adopted
Cody finished the story🥺
Solo FTW!!!
Roman got revenge on Rollins....but was reteaming with him in the Shield again just before Mox left.
The tribal chief should be Jacob Fatu
Idea to bring back the USOS 🤔
Wow I knew it was coming
Only big win solo had was john cena now he hurt lol 😆 😂 have yall noticed solo really can't wrestle everytime he gets clotheslined over the rope he botches everytime horrible
And they just signed Jacob fatu. New bloodline Civil War beginning. Roman will join jimmy and Jey and Summerslam for a 3 om 3. Rock returns  joins solo and retakes his thrown as the tribal chief beats cody for the undisputed title setting up a triple threat at WM 41 reigns vs rock vs cody for the title.
If anything jimmy uso should be da tribal chief mf dont even have a losin streak like solo does
ITS ABOUT F***** TIME SOLO GETS THIS PUSH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
they had to explain it for the kids lmao
Guerilla tactics!
No pop for Tonga lol
Will Jimmy be a good guy cause now he is no longer apart of the bloodline cause being spiked 3 times and getting the chair around his head sends a message you no longer apart of us
That's messed up Uce some Bloodline, more like traitors.
Redux of the Samoan Swat team? Jimmy was punished for how he lost to Jey. Trying to beg off and "apologize". So, was taken out.
“It’s like poetry, it sort of rhymes.” Roman makes his statement beating up Jey, Solo does it beating up Jimmy.
Jimmy should've stuck with his twin brother
I have never enjoyed WWE so much until now. Im loving the new era 👏🏼👏🏼
Wheres the Rock? Wheres Reigns?!   And wheres my food!?? 😠😠
Week jimmy and need to kiss and makeup now
Bloodline: where you can just have pacific islanders turn on each other in a merry go round of nonsense and people will eat it up.  Roman will be a "face" soon and the fans will just accept it.
My name is Paul haymen 😂😂😂
og club almost here
Toko-uso alliance?
The Bloodline is now in a civil war last time was more of a rebellion. This time it’s an all out war for the island of relevancy.
So this is how they bring back the Usos back together
Bloodline still the best thing going in WWE
No.
Sikoa is a lame character
Solo is mid. That whole family is mid.   Except Roman. Hes above average
Yooooo solo snappppedddd 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is already better than the BORING Cody reign!
Tonga look dumb with short hair
Solo, Tama and Jacob Fatu vs Roman and the usos
The Bloodline storyline just won’t end… and I’m here for it. This is just awesome cinema!
Guessing Rock is the new tribal chief. Rock with Solo and Tonga vs Reigns with Usos at Rumble. Eventually Heel Rock vs Babyface Reigns at Mania
I see Jey uso takeing Jimmy back an faceing solo an the other one next week
Paul Heyman SHIELD Advocate coming soon.
This runt is getting lippy. Chief needs to set him straight
Where Fatu at
Tama brings an edge and the ability for a decent promo to a Solo led Bloodline.
They should've made him turn on Roman
Let’s go 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Acknowledge Solo ☝️
Sikoa can be the new tribal chief. LETS GO
You think Jimmy deserves this beating from Solo and Tama Tonga for betraying Jey?
Roman will be back to help Jimmy at some point
Solo is starting the Bloodline Wolfpack 😂
We're ALL over this soman story !!! ITS DUMB change the scripture
yes Tonga finally all debut can wait to see where this goes
Jimmy and jey match at mania sucked so bad they gotta put them back as a tag team to be relevant
I’m calling it the new “tribal chief” will actually be Jacob Fatu
Nahhh they had to give solo a winning streak of some sort for him to come onto Paul like that he’s been the biggest loser since he beat John 😭😭😭
I’ve never seen Solo move so much standing in one place.  Normally, he just stands still.
hmmm solo becomes new tribal chief, seth makes roman realize the most powerful group always was the shield......ideas brewing
ROMAN   LOSES   AT WRESTLEMANIA   IT   IS  ABOUT   TIME   FOR   A   NEW   CHAMPION
Did Jimmy just lose his smile
roman finna come back to whoop solo or jimmy gon win
Solo is a Tazz rip off 😂 Just like Cena said
"Megatron has fallen! I, Starscream, shall now lead the Decepticons!"
How you're is Jey gonna feel about jimmy
Tonga gives me Bautista vibes
Dang- this is going to be a bad bad bad story- exciting do
I know it not just him joining
Paul heyman ladies and Gentlemen Wiseman on smackdown sikoa Solo attack Jimmy uso and betrayed  Paul Heyman call Roman Reigns break his phone solo sikoa hurt Jimmy uso
Now wait til Jacob and Zilla show up wonder who's side they'll take
Ohh my god I was. Stunned to hear that Solo nailed it Jimmy USO and I swear god 👀👀😳😱🫣🫣solo knew it why because of Jimmy was playing game over bloodline!I can't believe it my own eyes .
The bloodline needs to split then the elders like rikishi and haku have to come in a settle the bs when there just too much chaos going on.
Yep bloodline vs bloodline coming
THIS IS A LIE!!!!! IS THIS HAPPENING!!!!!??????? WHAAAAAT???!!!!!
Lol when u lose there are consequences says the guy who is 0-37 solo Sikoa … finally solo is not austistic now
The Bloodline story continues..Cody can have his story..i guess with the Rock now??maybe??but The Bloodline story just turned a new page...waiting for Roman to comeback and take back his throne
Solo & Tama together and Zilla and Jacob just signed to wwe it’s definitely Samoan dynasty takeover
All we need for this new Bloodline is Jacob Fatu and Zilla!
Yeeees
I honestly want Roman back now to put Solo away
The new line
woth them using this as the title id say yes they set him up beautifully for being the next Tribal Chef
Solo a joke lmao
This is brilliant.  Perfect way to introduce Tama.  Perfect way to turn Jimmy face and reunite the Usos, perhaps the best tag team in the world.  Perfect way to move Heyman on to something else(Bron?).  Perfect way to make Solo look like even more dangerous.  Well done.
Im surprised they didn’t pick a member of the Anoai family or Fatu to be the new member of the Bloodline. Can't wait for Jacob and Zilla debut.
So predictable… now Jimmy and Jey are gonna reunite
That was stupid
Baby face Roman?
CINEMA,wasn’t expecting this at all
The usos might be back and turn on the bloodline
Now we need Jason Fatu now
My take on this is Jimmy reunites with Jey tells him he was right etc they go on a year long feud with solo and tonga, tag match at mania where rock gets involved to help solo win, just when all hope is lost cue Roman Reigns music, returns as face and helps the usos. One can dream right lol
When Heymen said roman did not want this, I already know the rock order solo to do it
U know what they say too much love can get you hurt
Triple H takes control of DX after HBK lost to Stone Cold now Solo takes the Bloodline after Roman loses. New bloodline civil war.
The son of Haku? Wow. Tell me Paul LeVesque is keeping wwe relevant by bringing in past stars ir their kids. 😅
wait but didnt solo lose to jey where is his consequence
Jey gotta get involved in this now and bring other people
Jay tried to warn Jimmy dont trust Roman or solo yet Jimmy didn't listen now Jimmy bout to find out he made a terrible mistake
☝I acknowledge SOLO SIKOA
YOOO WHATTTT CHILLLLLL I CANTTT WHATT???
Did someone just yell at Solo saying he can't wrestle because he is a cheeseburger? 3:22
There was no such thing as accountability in the attitude era. Only unapologetically. 😂
Jimmy & Jey will reunite
Ain't Nobody Realer Than Guerilla.
Holy shart, did Triple H just turn Jimmy, Paul, and even Roman babyface in less than a week after Wrestlemania? Bonkers. Im all for this new chapter in the Bloodline, especially if it leads to Rock vs Reigns during SummerSlam.
Next chapter: Solo and Tama Tonga vs Reigns and Jimmy. There is definitely a rift developing in the Bloodline.
Back stage they say the tribal chiefs orders. Are they just soldiers and Jacob fatu gonna be the new tribal chief?
Solo shouldn't talk he loses alot
☝Roman LEAKEE
Final boss sending down orders 🤌🏻🔥
Hilarious How many losses does Sokoa have? Not one to speak. I do appreciate a good smack down though. That thumb is deadly 😂
So what Roman comes back as a face and we have Solo vs Roman
Bloodline: Civil War  I can see WWE naming one of their PLEs that 😂
Solo pulled some Godfather Part II levels of betrayal!
Finally a payoff lol It will be proven that unlike his father solo did It for the rock
I had to come on YouTube after I saw on TikTok the highlights
So solo and Tonga have solidified their spot in the tag division!.....great
Reminder to buy some Bitcoin.
maybe jimmy uso is maybe are gonna be usos again
Theyre implying the Rock is the tribal cheif, Rock pinned cody Roman didnt so thatll be the reasoning
The whole family going to be on wwe. Must be nice.
Wrestling is getting so good again
They need to give Solo the US Championship
So tiny Tonga decided to attack an OG bloodline member? Our tribal chief won't stand for this.
What did Jimmy do
Beautiful. I thought Solo would do this to Reigns to take the throne, but this works even better. Let Roman rest up for a bit while Solo reigns as Tribal Chief. Redemptive Babyface Roman is gonna be so good.
Thank you, Jimmy always was the weakest link..
Triple H and Steph DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT FOR BRINGING THE WWE BACK ALIVE AGAIN!!! IN THE FASION OF WWF!!!! HUNTER AND STEPH DESERVE THIS PEOPLE!!!!!
What in the world is going on here?? What just happened?? Lol
Solo vs roman reigns
So if they brought Tama Tonga straight in skipping NXT, I would figure the rumors of Jacob Fatu being signed the same thing is gonna happen with him to build up the likely Bloodline Civil War Storyline..
The Rock is behind all of this
Solo said losing has consequences then I remembered when was the last time Solo won😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tama Tonga gets zero pop lmfaoooo typical wwe fans got zero idea who’s who outside the E 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Backlash is going to be a cinematic link in the Bloodline lore.
I bet the rock is behind this.
Well I can’t wait to see what Roman got to say about this
The story goes ON AND ON!!! THERE ARE SO MANY OF THIS ENTERTAINING, TALENTED FAMILY!!!! THE WILL CONTINUE!!! CREDIT TO THE MOST DOMINANT FAMILY IN WWF/WWE!!!! AND LOVE THE HEYMAN IS CENTER OF IT ALL!!!  I'm a bobby "the brain" fan.. "Jimmy Hart", , "slick"  ALL THE ORIGINALS!!! BUT HEYMAN HAS MADE HIS CASE TO BE THE BEST AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE BEST LIKE BOBBY AND JIMMY THAT CAME BEFORE HIM!!!!
Solo’s gimmick is lame 😂
Jimmy gets his face turn and It seems Solo forms a New Bloodline alongside Tonga and Possibly Jacob Fatu??? It was never about the belt Long story telling at it's finest while putting over many stars This is why WWE is the Premier League of professional wrestling AND entertainment ' .
😂 Solo’s still scared of Roman
Jimmy will be back fresh as a daisy like nothing happened when he got destroyed last time by solo n then betrayed jey for no reason... remember that?
Tama FINALLY in WWE, gonna be interesting with him Finn and AJ
this is bigger than Samoans now..... We've now involved The Tungans ......!!!!!!
Yes,jimmy is free.
Solo went “Solo”
I can’t wait ik what’s gonna happen. It’s gonna be the usos and Roman reigns vs the rock solo and tomo HHH COOKING
Jimmy looking slim
Jimmy fell ti exactly what he told Jey
Roman comes back as a Face then Him & Jimmy vs Tonga/ Solo
When Jacob and Zilla join next so when Roman comes back the betrayal will happen then Face Roman will face the new bloodline
Roman and Jey reuniting!!!
The Good Guy !
This has the makings of a great feud. There is a power vacuum. Rather than Jimmy stepping up, Solo shoved him outta the way and brought in his own backup!!!!
So I guess we’ll never be done with this storyline….
It's called Jimmy and Jey reuniting!!!! LMAO!!! STOP BEING SO GULLIBLE!!!!
Book it. At some point over the next 12 months you will see a bloodline cival war. 3v3: Roman/Jey/Jimmy vs Rock/Solo/Tonga  Paul will be forced to pick which side he aligns with.
Could’ve been a great opportunity to reunite Jimmy and Jey Uso not as Tag Teams but as brothers. They had their Rivalry, it had been settled at WrestleMania and yet due to horrible writing, Jey didn’t save his brother. Honestly. Siblings fight and forgive each other afterwards. 🙄
When was the last time Solo won a match tho? Talkin about losing has consequences… bro lost like 50 times in a row
I wonder where does Zilla and The Samoan werewolf fit into all this🤔
So Roman gets the uso back on the same page, and they all become face, and then Rock, Solo, and Tonga will be the heels! Rock bloodline vs. Roman Bloodline! Which is the same just split into two
Jimmy Uso, he did too his brother he he’s a deserve it take out he did to his own brother JEY Oso the bloodline is over for good never come back again is finally over
i really hope the rest of G.O.D. are following Tanga lao and Hikuleo
Give heyman a grammy
Is it just me or do I not feel bad for Jimmy whatsoever?
Now all we need is the usos and Roman and or the full Shield back to say this is my yard
Solo u loose all the time while u trying to blame Jimmy
Jus wHen u tHink mfs give af about u you're wrong. BLOOD OR NOT
New Trible chief Solo 😂😂❤
Even tho Solo "loves" his brothers, I  think he sees them as incompetent goof balls.
This is what happens when you have a 2 star match with your brother at Mania.
Set up for a USOs reunion
I was wondering how they were gonna bring Tama in
I can't wait to see Paul Heyman's reaction when Roman Reigns comes back!
Dang I think jimmy misses his brother jey
How many of them are there?
Jimmy got attacked for telling Jey USO he love him and he quit at Wrestlemania
Toma Tonga
The dude who's lost 30+ matches in a row is the one talking about losing?
roman reigns or the rock is turning face  roman didnt gave the orders for this to be done.
Glorious!
Solo did it for Roman Reign same storyline when Rakishi did it for The Rock. That’s the only way to turn Roman Reign face again….
Solo: "losing has consequences" (also solo): has a losing streak*
Final boss era
The only full blood Samoan with a solid physique.
Is solo the new chief?
Where is Tanga Loa?
The whole tribal thing has jumped the shark...it's old...it's boring..
No honor among brothers. Cain killed Abel.😏
Paul Heyman's makeup made him look more like Paul Bearer.
The storyline should be Bloodline: Civil War
Was that the Hurricane?
We need to start a That’s Your Brother chant to Solo Sikoa
Y porque sus volas de furka  Romeres vienesnes todas ayudar  a el
Yes Solo
So, is Jimmy going to NXT or AEW? Because clearly he's not welcomed to Smackdown or Raw anymore.
Is it just me just cuss I really not a fan of Cody never have been he boring but the bloodline is still the then most interesting thing tonight Cody’s boring promo is even only at 99k views this video is at 168k im telling yall its coming the people will get tired of Cody he got change it up
Solo youve lost 40 straight matches 😂😂😂
Bloodline pretty lame now
Solo...Tribal Chief is laughable.  He's good at getting direction not giving direction and I believe he has more losses than Jimmy. The bloodline is on life support...
When the last time Solo won ohhh against Cena.  Since he said losing has Consequences he should have the same energy with Roman which he won't
HHH.. God bless you for this you saved another storyline for Smackdown i actually thought Toma was coming at Mania ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
So whats solos punishment for failing to win?
Roman Beats Solo
I know Finn is happy to see his boy join the WWE. They might actually reform the Bullet Club
Solo is very good
He’s been losing for 8 months talking about “losing has consequences” 😂😂😭😭
He said i love you meaning hes sorry that hes going to have tama attack him 😂
no way they got Tama Tonga!!
The umaga /  Tazz gemick are corny
i really wanted the whole bloodline including the rock to turn on roman at mania as soon as he lost .. for them to corner roman and stomp him out and no one helps him because of what he has put everyone through and they all turn there back on him and for the bloodline to tell hayman that this is family business ..
TAMA TONGA!
Solo becoming the head feels a lot like when HHH assume the top position in DX when HBK lost to Stone Cold when Tyson flipped on him. Tama Tong is the New Age Outlaws  OAN: in Jimmy and Jey’s pre match interview at WM40, Jey ended it by saying no matter what happens, the USOs can get back together but Jimmy would have to leave the Bloodline alone. Well… here we are….  Also… I will be glad when Zilla and Jacob Fatu make it to the Big Show
this smack down or the Polynesian Bowl
uso reunion on the way☝🏽☝🏽
Solo yelling at Roman to finish cody at wm was a hint
Son of Haku? He doesn’t look scary enough
EVIL LOVE 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Oh God no please 😂 Paul
Where's Jacob Fatu??
Tama Tonga!!!!
The Final Boss is most likely behind it. He’s not pleased with Roman and when he returns, he’ll take his place as the head of the table.
Triple H is killing it as creative Director
Seems like everybody asking about the Werewolf
The Final Boss😎 is pulling the strings behind the scenes, he made it clear on Raw he’s coming soon for Cody the new WWE champion, this will lead to Rock, Solo & Tama Tonga and hopefully Jacob Fatu with this new bloodline having an epic match at Survivor Series: War Games in November against the OG bloodline Roman, Uso brothers & Zilla Fatu.
Solo going for his ultimate heel push , holds Paul Heyman hostage in his click , love it , time for change
Tama 🇹🇴 wrecking Jimmy Uso, but this was punishment for what happened at WWE WrestleMania XL.
Looks like they're leading up to a full blown Bloodline civil war not like that small scale one where Jey pinned Roman. I wonder how many more samoan family members are going to be enlisted to fight this new war?
So they don't have faith in Jimmy
Kinda saw the solo turn coming called this in a discussion i had way before wrestlemania on a what if scenario.
Solo is loose
So is Jacob Fatu gonna come in and side with Jimmy?
Sounds like Solo wants to move to the head of the table in Roman's absence. Now I wonder if Jimmy and Jey Use are going to reunite even though Jimmy burnt that bridge turning on Jey bridges can be rebuilt.
Solo,Tonga,Fatu Vs Roman,Jey,Jimmy lets go or instead of Jimmy have Rock
Now where's  Jacob Fatu
"like a Phoenix from the ashes,your tribal chief...." I love how paul wants roman to remain tribal chief, but solo pretty much stomped out that "dream". You'd think by now that paul would learn that eventually someone else was going to step up and take romans place. By the time jacob fatu comes in, I'm assuming that the bloodline 2.0 is going to be powerful AF and heyman will have no choice but to either follow or get the f out of the way
It's time for solo to get his flowers😂😂 didn't see this coming
Jimmy can't catch a break 😂
OMG....Here we go. He is here baby. If yall don't know who he is then your in for a treat
it time for USO enjoy together
Wow Roman vs solo at summer slam is gonna be 🔥. Only bad thing is Roman will be a baby face.
Poor Jimmy. He really is all alone, now.
The Spider!!!!
😅nice
This show was  lit. Crowd was crazy!!!
Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve never bought Solo as the “enforcer” of that faction. And after the international squash tour he’s been on, I’m definitely not going to buy him as the head of the table.
No one cares
“I admire Cody for his courage. He doesn’t know this, but I watch him. I’ve watched everything he’s done since he left New York. I admire his strength and courage, the way he stood up to Kenny. He made that step before me, which I admired. So we gave him a chance to show he was with us, not against us, but he made his choice.” - Tama Tonga, 2018
This is Roman’s next storyline
Perfection 👌 🔥
Interesting. But im still done with WWE. Idc
That’s tuff Bruh
Ig the rock took the attitude era back with him… I hope smackdown and raw don’t get boring again now that wrestlemania over with
This has Final Boss written all over it.
Wow.. didn’t see that coming
Solo already had his 4/20 day I see
Why they jump on Jimmy
They replace Jimmy with tama
too bad roman wouldn't admit he lost and take resposibility for HIS loss. Good to see another bullet club guy in WWE. Bloodline civil war, i dig it, even though its been done,(bullet club - just ask tama) most great ideas are recycled.
Think about this Summerslam match  The Rock , Solo and Tama vs Roman Reigns and The Usos with Bloodline Rules and loser is exiled from the family
Tama Tonga things just got interesting!
Solo just isn't believable. He fumbles on the mic like hes doing a presentation
Tama Tonga is going to be the best Heel WWE has Never seen!… watch
solo gotta be the new tribal chief with tonga by his side & jimmy being took out from the bloodline this is cinema🤣
I thought solo .was going to sing the  national anthem  🎵😁
Now we can add "The Godfather Part 2" to movies that wrestlers have seen, in addition to Rocky! I'm here for it. Srsly, tho, great angle and I *hope* this means we'll get more from Solo, as this would hit harder if he's not on a losing streak.
Rock ordered solo to do this.  He is a genius. He made cody a hero and now he is gonna make roman the baby face again.
Bring the original Bloodline back, and let it be Roman & The Usos against Solo, Tama, and another cousin.
I don't remember Solo having a match at mania that might have slowed him down. Jimmy had a match though so Solo should have been the one to be punished lol.
HE GOT LAYETH THE SMACKETHDOWN‼️‼️
The fact that Japan was mentioned is awesome, no need insult the fans like there isn’t wrestling around the world.
Bloodline(NWO) vs Bloodline(Wolfpack)
lol seems like the rock the new tribal chief... he said when he returned a few months ago... that maybe he should sit at the head of the table.
Yea...just what we need, another vaguely gangsta "ultra-tough" Uso clone... yawn.
I feel like the Shield  is back in business as Dean Ambrose is back
OH MY GOODNESS !!!! WWE IS ON FIRE WITH THESE STORY LINES !!!!
I was at Smackdown in Detroit tonight! It was both my nephew and my first WWE live show! We were not disappointed!!
i guess he's gonna reunite with his brother jey again and that wont make sense jimmy turned on him a about year ago i guess jimmy got backstabbed because it was his fault roman is gone and he's the reason roman lost the belt to cody at night 2 at wm40 last sunday and i expected tama tonga would debut tonight
I never realized how much tama tonga looks like jorge masvidal... lol
You noticed they didn't have bloodline shirts.yeet
Ultimate pay off: The Rock returning with Jacob Fatu and Zilla as heels to take down Roman and the Usos. Solo loses faith in The Bloodline and splits and goes back..solo. That way Jey gets his wish for the org Bloodline to reunite as the "good guys"
Jimmy and solo should get a dp
I feel Solo will be way more viscous than Roman, Roman was just arrogant and boring. Solo bout to wreck shop!
Please tell me wrestling fans watching this clip get the triple H / D X fuel from nineteen ninety eight ? Shawn drop the ball Triple H picks it up . now we’re seeing solo run a new bloodline
The new Tribal Chief is The Rock
❤
Need jimmy and Jey too reunite now
“Businesses just picked up.” -Jim Ross
Great stuff!
So Tommy Davidson from Ace Ventura 2 is in the Bloodline
I think whats going to happen is solo is going to make his own bloodline   Roman going to come back when he ready   Make amends with both usos and take em down a notch and put him back in place  But if they got tama  .....zila coming with him next and it will be solo zila and tama vs roman and the usos
Tonga looks like Seth Rollins. Jajaja
Solo Is a true REBEL NOW... BRILLIANT IDEA   I've been waiting for this moment 😎
I wonder if tama brother tanga loa will come in has well ???
6:34 bro mind went blank cause he said that line twice already
Where tf do they keep getting these brothers from☠️☠️😭
That’s crazy …. Any else see that crazy sign that said solo throatkowa?? Or the throat goat one ? I was crying when I seen it 😂😂  And your winner SOLO THROATKOWAAA
Alright, I hate to admit it, but I like solo now. That was what he needed.
10 second penalty for Ocon
Jimmy laid out like a Family Guy character
No, the Final Boss is the new Tribal Chief!
Baby face Roman Reigns incoming
He's no tribal chief
They bring Tama Tonga in with Zella fatu and Jacob the samoan werewolf fatu you kinda have a Samoan bullet club
Tama Tonga, now time to bring in Jacob Fatu.   Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Jacob Fatu, new bloodline.   Could it be Roman Reigns turn face when he returns?  Solo Sikoa vs Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 41?
Solo is going to start running his own show and his own version of the Bloodline and get too out of hand for Paul then Roman is going to come back and have to put Solo in line. Roman vs. Solo is the next big feud.
Now Solo. You know you haven’t had a victory in  several months.
SOLO IS LITERALLY ON A LOSING STREAK RN SOO WTF IS WE DOING
Here we go again, and now where will jacob fatu will go now that he was signed with wwe today!
Now we need Tanga Loa.
Magats...
Now they need Tonga loa.    Guerillas of Destiny in WWE
i guess the USO reunite
Wyh Solo Why?😂😂😂
Is solo sikoa the new tribal chef if so we acknowledge you solo
Mr, Hayman has got to keep giving some kind of story to keep it alive
Haku is a name I've not heard mentioned by wwe or anywhere in a long time.
So roman might turn face again?
USOS vs GOD bring it!!!!
Roman reigns come back !!!! Fix this!!! Rock !!! Come help!!!!
Solo should have a face turn. We don’t want a jimmy face turn
Usos getting back together😊
Ain't nobody realer than guerilla!
Roman reigns has to come back and deal with this situation and protect Paul Heyman & deal with solo actions.  Roman Reigns is the powerhouse not solo!!!!!!!
Lord solo, rise!
Who cares?
Solo you lost 28 matches this year !!!!
What a laugh. Solo has lost his intimidation and is gonna crash and burn. The Bloodline is no more and good riddens
Are y’all kidding me? Y’all brought this little guy doesn’t even know what he’s doing 10 times smaller than Jimmy and y’all think he’s gonna help y’all get back on track.😂😂😂😂😂
WWE on USA do you wanna know whose fault it really was Paul Hayman. It was his fault because he was perfectly not injured not hurt and he watched the 123 and he let Roman reigns lose he could’ve pulled the ref off and did not.
lol the guy in the orange in the back with the BITCOIN shirt
“Get Uugghhhpppp!!!” 😂😂😂
certainly feels like the beginning of a new era in WWE thats for sure
So who is the chief now?
they just milking this bloodline stuff lmao
lol Roman lost and he still thinks he just send people to talk for him 😂😂 He ain’t Brock lesnar
I knew it solo would take over shades of when triple h took over dx when Shawn Michaels lost at wm14
Not my tribal chief
Jimmy and Roman lose at wrestlemania while solo been losing for like 8-7 months
Bloodline civil war  And Jacob Fatu hasn’t even debuted yet
It's a great time to be a Samoan in the WWE right now.
I will always remember 4/12/24 as THE smackdown after mania
So dumb when these guys know who it is.
The funny thing is technically wise Solo Sikoa has been on a 20+ losing streak since beating John Cena.
The Bloodline don't miss 🔥🔥🔥
Did not expect this tbh. Now anything is possible. So many questions. - is The Rock behind it? Like rock did get the win on night 1 and Roman failed in night 2. So maybe solo wants rock as the new tribal chief
“This is not what the tribal chief does!!!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 6:51 and then that scream 6:54 🤣🤣🤣😂
Another Civil War match incoming
Do you smell that.   Jey and Jimmy teaming up to take them on
DOBBY IS A FREE ELF NOW!
Summerslam will be Roman, Jey and Jimmy vs rock, solo and Tonga.
What does that mean?
Solo, Jacob Fatu, and Tonga. I like I like. Get Haku as the new manager and id pop
Wait wins and losses matter? Since when? And how much Solo gotta lose to equal 1 Roman loss? Math ain't mathing 🤣
They’re at the top of the 5th inning!  Great move to elevate Solo, bring in Toma Tonga, possibly Jacob Fatu and Solo is the new Tribal chief
Now we wait for Jacob Fatu...
Solo keeps losing though
Next one to come is Zilla Fatu!! Which is Umagas Son. This is awesome
I wonder if this starts a storyline that culminates in Solo Sikoa vs Roman Reigns
Is today Opposite Day? Because I don’t think that’s what you do to someone you ‘love’
How many people actually knew he was coming ? I was a doubter 😂
Let's go solooooooo lol
Solo bloodline bouta be chaotic ☝🏾
Feeling real ucey all over again
Roman giving order, clean house!
Lame
Survivor Series 2024:  War Games Rock, Solo, Tonga and Fatu vs Reigns, The Usos and…wait for it…Sami Zayn
Roman comes back later as a face and challenges Solo for Tribal Chief rights 😳😳
I'm shocked to see Tama Tonga in the WWE.  I guess they are trying to make Roman Reigns babyface now.
Funniest story line ever
I’m interested to see where we gonna take this 👀
Roman going to be a big baby face when he returns
Jimmy going to be crawling back to Jey next week.
I guess Jimmy’s gonna be off of tv for a while.
Awesome segment. A+. Sets up so much storyline
Solo taking over by building his own bloodline with Tonga (and hopefully Jacob Fatu)  in the light of Roman’s loss is a dope way of continuing the bloodline story 🙏🏾 very interested to see how this grows
This is now lame af
Jey uso is not going to like this
Cena should came out😂😂👀n f5 solo
Tama Tonga is a beast and has been for years in NJPW.  G.O.D was always one of my favorite tag teams.
Wow Jimmy  & Paul Heyman.  Did not  see  this coming  with Solo.  It look like  Heyman  had fear in his  Eyes.😮
Well, that was dumb of Solo... he's been on a losing streak.
So roman is coming back as a baby face lol
On the G he was acting like RR 😂😂😂😂Solo
Jimmy will join jay
3:00 😡BUT LIKE A PHOENIX RISING FROM THE ASHES YOUR TRIBAL CHIEF Rr 😐 😶
Tama Tonga is in WWE, that's so hype!!!!!!
ROMAN IS NOT THE TRIBBLE CHEF NO MORE CODY IS
Solo The new tribal chief now💯💯
Solo;Wiseman look at me,look at me I'm the tribal chief now 😂
I would not be surprised if Roman was behind the Jimmy attack.Or was he not?
Can't wait for the Bloodline Civil War!
Usos vs. G.O.D soon?
Solo the most piece of trash I've ever seen in wwe
Roman reigns will get reinforcements for his bloodline
4:51 Was he punching the air? Lol
Solo had a Michael and Fredo moment with Jimmy.
Bloodline civil war and part 2
Now we need Jacob Fatu
Jacob Fatu- Real Tribal Chief 💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥 excellent in my Mr Burns voice
Jacob Fatu to soon join them....will lead to a 6man tag of Roman & the Usos vs Solo, Fatu & Tonga
Tribal court would have been cool. Put Roman in the seat for loosing, surprised it hasn't happened yet.
Solo give Jimmy the hug of death just like when your in wrestling the leader of that group would most likely give you the kiss of death before attacking you.
Question….who lets the little brother beats up the big brother? That wouldn’t haven in a black family.
@3:27 “You talk like a 5th grader!” 😂
Maybe Rikish can be the new bloodline wiseman
I’ll bet Jimmy USO will reconcile with his brother Jey USO once he is healed.
Why take it out on Jimmy uso
Another civil war?👀
i dont think they can call themselves Bloodline anymore.. Cause they not even related and Tama Tonga not even Samoan😵😮.. maybe new faction name coming soon? 🤷‍♂👆
Jimmy will be out a while. He will return with Roman. Rock will be Solos High Chief. Bloodline Civil War. Ends with a Wiseman on a pole ladder match.
Roman was a forgiving tribal chief but solo is gonna be a dictator
Solo Sikoa is the new Tribal Chef kicks out Jimmy Uso    1:21
I wonder if Jacob will be next to join?
Didn’t rikishi and haku used too tag together back in the attitude era ?
Finally
Oh no they don't need to reunite jey and Jimmy next up is Fatu or either Tonga brother fuko's other son new bloodline is coming
This segment was insane
Wonder what Jey is thinking watching this
Roman is not going to be happy about this when he gets back lol
🫢😲😳🤯 WTF! LETS MUTHAFCKIN GO N THE BLOODLINE PLOT CONTINUES TO GRAB MY FULL UNDIVIDED ATTENTION! What a time to be alive n be a wrestling fan , haven't had so many unexpected moments that I literally pop for since the Monday night wars
It’s wack it’s literally goin downhill
Not who I was expecting, I thought that Jacob Fatu was showing up.
Jey should have come help Jimmy
Toma tonga should have never cut his hair, should have had the GOD paint etc
Aint nobody realer ..
And if the rumor is true, there will also be a "Samoan Werewolf" joining too. ☝🏼
Gimme tama v balor NOW
The bloodline's storyline is better than any storyline in the WWE ever. Thank you Triple H for change. It's finally entertaining again.
Jimmy just go back with Jey tag team lol maybe will happen?
You know Roman is going to come back and take out solo when he has been losing for 8 months straight lol.
Maybe Solo will get a win now.
Sheild rebuild# bet
Jimmy lost to jey
Jacob up next
Roman face turn loading
This feels like in Pokémon after team galactic lost their leader and it wasn’t the same anymore lol
Solo sikoa next heyman guy... watch heyman at the end turn on roman when he faces solo at summerslam
Roman coming back as baby face to save the blood line
Is the Bloodline the WWE “BulletClub”?!?!?!😮😮😮😮
So roman vs solo?
Is NJPW wrestlers coming to WWE Now ok 😅😅
Some people are dumb Tama Tonga is not part of the rocks bloodline. Haku is not related to the anoa'i family. Haku trained with the wild Somoans. Tama Tonga is pretty good tho, he's part of the bullet club.
I gotta ask this... Does Tonga like to tango? 😂😂😂 Please don't cancel me
Roman face turn confirmed? I think Roman will come back to challenge solo
This is bananas!!!
The Rock is pulling the strings and he will announce himself as Tribal Chief. His new film will be done in August and Roman is scheduled to return then as well. The bloodline civil war has begun.
Seeing Tama Tonga debut, just makes me want to see Jacob Fatu in a WWE ring all the more. A feud between he and Solo would be pretty epic.
He went from being a member of the bullet club to the bloodline
😁 This reminds me of when DX Shawn Michael's lost to SC Steve Austin at Wrestlemaina and The Monday night Raw after HHH Form A New DX , Same thing with Solo bro
The rock is new t chef
Yea, if it's true about Jacob we should see him soon, and I'm hoping Jimmy comes back he is more vicious im hoping we finally see a unhinged Jimmy.
Jimmy gonna crawl back to jey.solo.vs roman 🎉
This happened to my uncle Chip.
W
Jacob & Tama should run the Bloodline…Solo has only won one other match besides Cena in the last how long?
Just getting rid of the dead weight 😂
I may be off but could there be a blood line cival war at Survivor series war games.?
Well rikishi did tell solo take no prisoners my new tribal Chief ladies and gentlemen ☝️🏆
Usos Back?
who’s this Taga Tongga guy?
Zero pop for Tama Tonga 😂
Bro when’s the last time solo got a win on tv😂
They better start booking Solo as a juggernaut until he faces Roman Reigns and the Usos eventually
I cannot believe that Tama Tonga it's finally in the WWE😮😮
Uso reunion incoming👀
Now ?? Is his bro Jim com bac wit Roman
And this what leads to the reunion of the usos
Jimmy will go back with hey
So we’re gonna pretend Solo didn’t lose so many ? 😂
Solo is the new king
lol this sets up the coming for jacob
I’m sorry but Roman Reigns should’ve been here for this segment and then he leaves afterwards
Tama Tonga is 41 years old and making his WWE debut. If Vince was still in charge, he would have probably made Tama Tonga a maximum male model. 😅
How does a dude with a personality of a chalkboard take over the bloodline? Yall thought Roman was bad at talking on the mic all them years ago when Cena and others clowned his mic skills this goofy great value brand of Umaga is 10x worse and shouldn’t even have a job in the WWE.
I thought his name was Jacob fatu
How many loses in a row does Solo have? Yeahhhh, Id take Jey as the new Tribal chief or even Jimmy. Solo is BORINGGGGG.
Is this going the direction of NWO Wolfpac? 🤯
Jey Uso where are you jimmy uso getting destroyed
It’s official Jey and Jimmy make be getting back
I’ve never seen Paul use notes
Never thought Tama would be in WWE
Dope. I like Jimmy. I want him to stop being a good and turn up. But don’t make Jey and Jimmy get back together just yet
I was confused with solo tlkn bout loses and consequences,when his last match he won?
Jacob fatu will join
Bruh I felt every samon spike to the throat. Oh my gosh ion think imma be able to talk for 2 weeks 😂
Listen!, The Samoan Dynasty is NOT playing right now!
Now when is Jacob Fatu gonna show up
Also, for those that know, AJ Styles and Tama have history. Tama wasn't part of the faction that kicked AJ out of bullet club; we may be seeing the reformation of a powerful faction, and with the Judgemental Day possibly splitting. Aj, Finn, Solo, Tama.
😡 🥺 why Solo why
I can see roman jay and Jimmy vs rock solo and tonga the story like gets deeper and deeper
It comes full circle. Jimmy said he wanted Solo to be tribal chief months ago. Probably not the way he hoped though lol.
Nones pretending to be ones?
IF THEY HAVE ROMAN DO A RESCUE MISSION FOR PAUL 😃❤
Roman taught Solo too well lol
If Sola turn on roman when he get back
I. Think Brock lesner ls coming,!!
This means solo and Tama will be on The Rock’s bloodline and jay and jimmy on Roman’s side this will be wild Bloodline vs Bloodline civiles war
If that's love I don't want to see hate.
If Tama cones in in waiting for Tanga Loa I NEED GOD IN WWE
Jimmy regretting turning on Jey right about now. The revenge on Seth makes no sense when you realize the Shield had a short reunion before Roman had gotten sick.
Roman reigns won't be happy
How Jacob Fatu and the Rock factor into this?
Paul hemans job is done here he needs to let the bloodline fight among themselves and step down this storyline can go on without him he's made his money he needs to turn braun breaker into a star now or go back to cm punk😅 or both at the same time
Reigns, Solo, Tonga and Fatu would be a crazy squad.
Jimmy is Going to Jey Uso and begs for protection, and Jey Uso will be, like I told you, should have listened and good bye. Then Jimmy is going to be attacked again and Jey Uso be like dam it. And then Jey gos and helps Jimmy Uso.
Weakest so called "finisher" of all time
GOD vs USO
lmao
His name is Solo makes sense 😂🤞🏿💡💯
Roman dropped the belt to Cody because of his leukemia.
The steelface!!!!
The Rock’s call
FINALLY....SOLO GETS HIS PUSH
Jimmy going back to jey
...and with that, the seeds have been planted for:  A bloodline coup d'état An Uso reunion Roman coming back to reclaim the bloodline, and a face turn.
Lol dude Jey was totally drunk when he tackled Jimmy on that table. I've seen that look in his eye before. My brother was notorious for that look followed by a spear as well, and he was drunk every time 😂
I LIKE THE WAY SOLO GRAB THE PHONE FROM PAUL AND STEP ON IT
Well, if anyone was worried about the Bloodline storyline getting stale…
I want Tama back with Finn and the Good brothers.
Oh and Roman is released from WWE. Due to not keeping his diagnosis with WWE. Think about 6 months ago he looked good and now he's skinny.
So Jacob Fatu has to be next can’t story line just keeps getting better
Tonga signing is better than aew
This is how they're gonna reunite jimmy and jay I guess
Yeah…. Roman just turned face.
Roman’s return is going to be CRAZYYYY. THE CHIEF WILL RETURN
Solo saw Jimmy vs. Jey and had enough.
Solo was like F*** Roman Reigns😂😂😂
Great twist, but I still want them to bring in Jacob Fatu
It’s okay to have an 8 month loosing streak but you can’t lose at Maina 😂
Acknowledge my tribal chief Roman reigns
Screencap this, Jacob Fatu will be the New Tribal Chief.
No Roman still the tribal chief
Bro i was screaming Jim was my fav member of bloodline and Samoan wrestler in general 😭😭😭
I love this. Even Paul is playing a new role. So much potential here. Will Roman suffer consequences?
There's a new sheriff in town
Rock’s orders. He’s going behind Roman’s back. It’ll be a heel Bloodline managed by the rock. Solo, Fatu, and Tonga vs a face Bloodline managed by Heyman: Reigns, Jey, and Jimmy
The Rock.....aka the final boss.. Is the new leader.
So I’m guessing there’s a new bloodline and Roman will return to help jimmy and jey
What? No vignette? How are we supposed to know who this dude is? 🤔
I legit thought that was Seth Rollins for a hot second lmao
TT is him bro. Excited to see him utilized and Solo have some actual dialogue and character development lol
Bloodline jey uso 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Oh my God! Tama tongs…
Just gonna be a boring tag storyline. Jimmy and Jey gonna team up.
Awesome debut for Tama, awesome story development for the Bloodline. A great way to keep them relevant in Reigns absence and the he returns it's gonna be f***n chilling! WWE has been at God Mode with a lot of their booking.
Jimmy can never get dabbed up😭😭😭
The Usos coming back
I guess Jey was right all Along
I feel like the bloodline story will be better than Cody with the title. Triple h said that everyone will have eyes on Roman story.
Wtf did I just witness
Cheering for Jey like he stands a chance against the new Bloodline 😂Roman has to show them who the Tribal Cheif is!
Solo has no charisma, trying to force him on everyone as a main eventer when he has the skill set of a mid carder at best
Boss move Sikoa
King's haku son will cause destruction everywhere
Well… Cody Rhodes promised to take everything from Roman Reigns… Looks like he’s doing that!
Paul is the GOAT
The new storyline has been set! Will the USO RETURN TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM TILL Roman comes back? I like the new storyline!
Roman  regins  is got to be very upset  about  all this  you injured  jemy uso you have both Paul hayman  in Roman  regins  turning babyface  for another bloodline Civil  war
Bloodline story continues!!! The Solo Chapter starts
Ngl why did I cry when I saw this ????😂
This definitely looking like another bloodline story is coming up just when you think is over nope now feud within the family now this is going to be on fire 🔥
Jimmy  switched his brand to Yes Yeet
If there's a Bloodline Civil War , Rikishi needs to be the special guest referee
Solo has arrived 😈😈😈
The Usos will be teaming up for Solo and Tonga.  People said The Rock ordered the turn but I think it was Roman Reigns it's going to be a lot of storytelling for this or what if it was Paul Heyman LOL ?
Hopefully we get a usos reunion next year or something i don't wanna rush it but im excited but jey deserves his solo run he has right now
In words of Titus O' Niel "' i dont know what just saw''' Yjis shocking plot twist debut of Tama Tonga made my jaw drop to the floor THIS IS CINEMA
That took me by surprise😮
Bruh this is brilliant… this was the moment I’ve been waiting for! Solo taking over the bloodline. First he dealt with Jimmy and for sure he’s going to deal with Roman for losing the title… that story arc alone has so much potential push..
THIS WAS CRAZY (⊙_◎)
how can solo be a leader when never wins?
This is the whackiest storyline all this year. Putting a guy like solo on as the chief is crazy asf
I like the idea of Solo *finally* being something more than the silent attack dog, but I don't think he's that good on the mic yet.
Can’t wait till Zilla Fatu join WWE
The start of turning roman reigns into a baby face
Tonga a monster. Credibility to the wwe. He looked like he was giving the beating down to jimmy
Solo is really starting to give off Tuco vibes from Breaking Bad. I hope they realize it too and go down that route and have him a hot head that everyone fears that goes off the rails fast.
Now we are about to see why Solo Sikoa should be taken seriously and add Tama Tonga shiiii.... we talkin now
Roman, Paul, Jimmy v.s. Solo, Tama vs Rock, Jey  Roman, Paul, Solo, Tonga vs Rock, Jimmy, Jey  Roman, Paul, Rock vs Jimmy, Jey vs Solo, Tonga  So many different avenues they can take this! Feels like a BC story already
They should go to Jail seriously.
Booooring
I knew that Solo Sikoa was going to give his big brother Jimmy Uso a Somoan Spike when he hug Jimmy especially when Jimmy tried to shake Solo's hand
And just like that, the end of the bloodline is over .. for now 😂
Bullet Club OGs are here!
They booing roman and in like a month they will be crying back for roman dumb fool's 😂
And just like that. The bloodline is once again divided
This the most back door family I’ve seen😭
I'm sorry, who is you??🤔
The Bloodline is changed
Gorillas of Destiny!!🔥 ☝🏿🤘🏿✊🏿
The bloodline succession arc begins!!!
This should make for a very exciting story turn.  But now, we just gonna ignore how impressively Paul Heyman jumped down from the apron too?
whos the dork with the bitcoin tshirt lmao
Lol dis gonna be crazy solo doin him now
Let’s hope
Love how a bloodline is gonna keep on going.
When we thought the bloodine saga was over, HHH said Sikeeeee
This story keeps getting better and better 🔥🔥🔥
Solo about to be a duet with Tonga 😮
😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good on you Jimmy
The Orders are from The Final Boss
He needs to spike roman for losing as well
Jimmy gonna join judgment day probably
He needs to spike himself for losing all the time
Will the Usos reunite now!
I'm not gonna lie...that seem really acted
Jey tried to warn Jimmy about the bloodline smh
Solo giving off Bishop from the movie Juice vibes!
This crazy
Jay must be saying to himself I told you so
Tonga more over in 5 minutes then Okada and Mone the entire time they have been in AEW.
Build up to Roman vs Rock with different bloodline members?
Now we has 3 of the original founders of Bullet club all in the WWE. The only one missing is Bad Luck Fale. He would have been perfect of the New Bloodline as the Under boss
Jacob Fatu joins the Bloodline next week! I’m calling it, now.
Well, this Faction is over.
Now this is good, having solo prove that he’s the top guy now
Interesting. What the real story. What's the Deal??
He's going back to jey. That's what going to happen.  Jimmy deserves it.
About time they do something with solo I’m excited
The New Tribal Chief is The Rock
So they go from roman and the rock to two jobbers? The usos should have just stayed together.
Should of stayed with your brother Jay lol
Sikoa is the acting Chief until Roman Reigns returns 😂but he is the tribal heir though I'm guessing that comes with some authority 🎉
Tongans vs Samoans
I remember when most fans including myself thought AJ Styles in WWE was a fever dream until it happened. Tama is a beast in the ring, and this gives me hope that I'll see Ospreay, Omega or Sabre Jr in WWE someday.
“Losing has consequences” *says the guy who has been 0-38(?) since he beat Cena*
The writing is amazing
solo just acting up because they aint let him sing the national anthem at wm😹😹😹😹
Jey, jimmy, Roman vs rock, solo, tama- bloodline civil war coming soon….
Poor Paul
Solo: As everybody knows, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
Add Jacob Fatu and Umaga's son
Tima  Tonga
I see how this end , Roman and The Usos reunite , somehow Rock vs Roman will close the rivalry
Is just tough love 💯💯
Wow, this got interesting
Diet Umaga is my new favorite.
He finally grew some balls
Tama Tonga is here WHAT WOW The Bloodline storyline is about to get more interesting.
Good for Tonga. This could keep the Bloodline fresh until Jacob Fatu is ready for the main roster, and I'm here for it.
I bet a lot of people don’t even know who he is
good
Welcome to WWE and smackdown Tama tonga.
Bet Jimmy wishes he had jey by his side now lol 😂 too late big Jim deal with it like jey had deal with it table’s definitely turned
Dang going to have to tune in to see the Samoans cook!
And Here you Have it jey uso warned Jimmy but he Didn't want to Listen 😂😂😂 Maybe now he'll make sense to himself and back his brother
He's Here!!!!!
TAMA TONGA! GOD, baby!
NWO Wolfpack vs NWO Red
Solo has been getting BEATEN time and time again. Took him long enough to finally snap
I LOVE U.. TOXIC RELATIONSHIP
Now Jacob Fatu Samoan Swat Team returns
Solo had some aura tonight. He needed that!
OMFG WTF
Now I’m raising the finger since Roman isn’t here 👆👆👆
Solo Sikoa has potential
Update: He dead!
TAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did solo just turn heel but ain't he already heel or is he face now 🤔 I'm confused
NOW I WANNA SEE THE BLOODLINE INTERACT WITH JUDGRMENT DAY IMAGINE THE STARE DOWN BETWEEN TAMA AND FINN THE 2 OG BULLET CLUB ALSO KARL ANDERSON MAKE TNAT 3
BUT HES BEEN LOSING THIS ENTIRE TIME?!?!👀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is why jimmy USO needs to be with jey
Well Tha Tribal Cheater Roman Reigns is No longer Champion or The Head of tha Table Solo is broken Free with his new Family Member & he's takeover the Wiseman now feel bad for Jimmy USO No YEET 💯
Solo betrayal Jimmy usos bloodline
Sir this is a Wendy’s   Aka   Who DA FOOK IS DAT GUY
What happened to the Rock? Is Roman Reigns out of the bloodline?
Very happy for Tama Tonga
This will probably cause Jey to help Jimmy still reuniting the Usos down the road. Cause a brothers love is different no matter the beef.
Long time coming
Bloodline civil war. I freaking love it
See, unlike the other company. They told me were Tonga came from.
Dammmmm this is how they get The Usos back together!
The bloodline is never gonna be the same
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  END THE BLOODLINE stuff, it's getting more stale than 2 year old bread
Uso are gonna destroy solo and Tonga
Looks interesting might have to watch how this storyline plays out 💪🏻
Roman Reigns is gonna turn good.
A loser that hates losing!
Jimmy Uso is the perfect example of stardom not being genetic lol
They keep trying to make Solo a thing. This is like the Transformers after Optimus died…
Solo, Tama, and Jacob Fatu.....  OMG
Cinema 🔥
Now they know Solo and Tama are zero match for the Usos
Idiots it's fake. Not real if you don't understand
This is definitely gonna lead to a push for both Jimmy and Solo, along with a Jimmy face turn and maybe Jacob Fatu finally debuting.
DAWG. TRIPLE H IS COOKIN
While it may appear that Solo is the New Tribal Chief, he's always been an underling and while he was treated like a serious threat earlier in his run, he has lost EVERY SINGLE MATCH ever since he beat John Cena.  So this leads me to believe that Solo is following orders and the NEW Tribal Chief may actually be either The Rock himself or Jacob Fatu.
Now give us Jacob fatu and will be forgiven
Tama Tonga looks like Seth Rollins a bit
😂😂 so what about roman losing and his consequence 🤔
Solo went SOLO...😏
Solo is the wins he has in his column in 04. 😂😂
Jimmy and jey might be back together soon
Solo is taking over as tribal chief and Roman Reigns is gonna have an issue with that when he returns!!!
Jacob Fatu next to join the Bloodline.  Maybe he’s calling the shots.  Maybe he’s the new Tribal Chief
Well...that was a swerve.
Looks like the uso are getting back together soon
Calling it now Rock And Usos vs Reigns/Solo/Tonga
😱😱😱
Let me guess these two vs the Usos.
Very stupid don’t make sense at all
Tama tonga isn’t even in the Fatu family. His family is from Tonga, not samoa. Solo is bringing in ringers 😑
Tama Tonga with the Bloodline now Thank you God for this and Legendary 🏆🐐🎯🙏❤️
just make sure tama doesn't do those deadly chops he gave okada LOL
Solo = 0-100000000000000 no win joe
Hold up hold upp.....jey usooo.... on stand-by.......
They are still extending the whole Bloodline stable?  It'll be as big a failure as the nWo after Starrcade '97 and we all know of WCW's fate
Heyman's reactions are always gold
As the Bloodline Turns… I felt like I was watching a hood classic 😂 being a good actor must run in the “bloodline”
You should of let him sung the national anthem both nights at wrestlemania 40
When the little brother is finally big enough to take on the older brother
Don't like this twist...P....U
Jimmy's done ☠️☠️☠️☠️
Jimmy is probably going to ask Jey to bring back the Usos
Genius! Roman has always been timid towards Solo from the beginning and we're seeing why
Usos reunion coming soon
This is actually a good thing! Bloodline continues n now USOs can tag again
This is how you debut!! Tama Tonga should do BIG things here!
The new Bloodline .
Turning jimmy into a clown makes sense now.
You know.... this could be a brilliant way to bring Roman back as a face. Paul Heyman is techincally cutting a face promo right now. I feel like they'll make a storyline of Solo recruiting more into the bloodline and wrecking havoc, all for Roman to return as a face, recruit, Jimmy, recruit Jey.... and maybe even recruit Sami Zayne to take on the new bloodline. Just a thought...
Consequences have actions and end of certain things
If you played wwe2k24 you knew Cody was gonna win storyline on there has roman goin to Hollywood  until you get close to his record 😂😂
So we got Tama Tonga, seems like there's 2 more shoes to fill, and will we see Heyman discarded too
Jimmy should’ve never joined back with the bloodline to begin with
Uses to reunite???? Jey felt that!!!
The fact that jey didn't come to save his twin after wrestlemania,  that means that Jimmy will have to turn face and go against Tama tonga.
As long as the bloodline is here im still watching wwe.
They need to let the bloodline story thing go unless they are using Paul to help solo and Jimmy get better as single competitors
Guess the losing streak for solo is over lol
Well we know Jay is going to come save Jimmy.
Roman coming back as a face
Did anybody notice that no one came to help Jimmy. All that time helping the bloodline did nothing but make enemies including his own brother This is what jealousy would do to you.
When you begin to realize it wasn't the championship that made the Bloodline story so interesting.
This is so jimmy and hey can reunite
That mean the USOS coming back?
If you ever heard the stories about Haku, I’m pretty positive the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
jimmy roman and paul vs solos tama tonga, i know paul was with solo but paul will join roman when roman gets back
4:10 *Am I…my brothers keeper?*   Nino and G-Money moment right there 😂😂
Roman created a monster .
Solo is one of the lamest characters in wrestling history.
USOs reunite vs the new bloodline at backlash. Might be too soon but summerslam at most
What a plot twist.  Solo Sikoa being the new Tribal Chief, huh?  What the heck about Roman Reigns? And the Rock?
Jimmy, Jey, Roman vs Solo, Tama, Rock
I think the rock gave the order as the tribal chief to kick out Jimmy
I think roman is next,there going to turn roman face
so now what?  solo brings in one more guy and has a 6man with roman and the usos at summerslam?
Thats crazy that tama tonga is sighned to wwe now just need his brothe then both g.o.d will be in the wwe
I'm down with this
Can't talk about losing when you losing every other match and every big match
Solo ur new tribal chief  That was it for Roman after losing at WrestleMania 40 😂😂😂
So now wat gonna happen I bet any mighty dollar jimmy an jey uso gonna be back together again frfr
Does this mean Solo is bringing in his cousin Jacob?????
Is toma related to the usos?
Tonga was just punching air half of the time bro😂
I think this is what The Rock would've done if he didn't leave the company again.
A new Era in the making  Solo sikoa reminds me of Umaga  Wwe will never be the same again
Gonna bea Bloodline Civil war.. OG Bloodline Roman and the Usos vs New Bloodline Solo, Tama and Jacob
Now they'll bring up Jacob Fatu and have him team with Jimmy.
That's wrong how they did Jimmy
Tama’s in WWE!?
Yeah Roman Reigns will have his consequences next week when Solo Sikoa and Tonga attacks him.
The final piece is adding Jacob Fatu
Umm didn't Solo get put through a table?
Jay please stay on raw
So jimmy going to get the other cousin and have a 2 on 2
Oh my goodness!!! I don’t even know what happens next but wow
Solo Sikoa just Kicked out Roman Reigns and Jimmy Uso,held captive Paul Heyman,and Tamu Tonga!..I guess that means Jacob Fatu is gonna join the new bloodline
About time
Looks like things are getting set up for that bloodline civil war
Y E S. GoD loading
Solo need to go after Logan Paul ASAP
yes consequences solo.. your 0-32 atm lmao
Solo should go… solo. He has a lot of potential and plus the bloodline is offline 😂
I never would thought I see the day that Tama Tonga would join that's truly insane hopefully we'll see Tanga Loa join as well
tonga is 41 and coming to wwe lol. he ain't got that many yrs left. it was awesome. looks like the rock is pulling the strings
I knew it was coming but not so soon. Feel like he may have gotten injured in the main event spot
Does this mean that Jimmy and Jey will be a team again?
"Losing has consequences" - says the guy that has not won since Crown Jewel.
I knew it was coming but not so soon. Feel like he may have gotten injured in the main event spot
Didn’t solo also fail
Jacob Fatu will side with Jimmy
I was really hoping Jey would come out and Jey and Jimmy can be the Usos again, Maybe go against Tonga and Solo
I'm all in for the solo heat comin
So Roman jimmy and hey bout to team up lol
So we get a cracked out roman
Blood cuz?
What a debut Tonga
Romans baby face turn
Jey and jimmy gonna be cool again
Jimmy’s all alone now… welp you earned that.
Solo is not ready he's only here because of his family
Will, it’s look like the Big dog are away, the kittens are out to play!!!!
The guerilla of destiny is here
Yoo😂 just when I think the bloodline storyline is getting boring it always finds a way to get better lol
Tama vs Cody BC unfinished Business   Tama vs Finn  3 out 4 OG members in wwe
USOs about to reunite
WHERES ZILLA FATU?!?!?!?!?!?!
Jimmy Uso turned on his brother Jey and now the Bloodline turned on Jimmy!!! Bet he wished he had Jey by his side now!!!
I thought it was Jey
So did Roman Reigns just turn face? Or is this the new bloodline?  I feel like Paul will eventually be attacked by Solo, he’ll miss a few weeks then appear with some backup in beast form if you feel me.
Solo: I love you Proceeds to beat the ish out of Jimmy
Roman, Jey, and Jimmy VS The Rock, Solo, and Tonga incoming.
Did Solo betrayed Jimmy Uso?😮
I respect it  🫡 🔥
Jimmy might be dead lol
Are we going to see a reconciliation between Jimmy and Jey?
Are they bringing GOD to WWE?
Jimmy deserves that
It's a Good Thing Jey Had a Good Night Last Monday
Didn't Roman hit Seth with a chair  after their title match at a Ppv like 2 years ago? I think it might've been SummerSlam
This is exactly how you debut someone so highly touted as Tama Tonga and immediately establish him as a potential top guy. The whole Bloodline story clearly still has so much left to be fleshed out including Roman likely turning babyface once he returns, the Usos possibly reuniting soon and if Jacob Fatu is indeed with WWE now like I'm hearing, bringing him in and adding him to the storyline, so there's so many directions this could go in now that Solo is stepping up.
Just hope the usos don’t get back together I’m fine with Jay helping out but he needs to stay solo
Tama!!!!! Omg
Solo hasn't won a match in months no way he's the new Tribal Chief 🤣🤣
Jimmy and Roman turn face, join Jey to face Rock, Solo and Tonga???
Too bad the bloodline is played  out  and this was as lame as aew  airing cm c#%t footage.  Desperation stinks
WOOOO!!!
I heard Roman Reigns LOST🤣BRUHHHH Jimmy getting jump .😯😯😭😭😭🤣🤣
Bro im loving wwe right now. We back bois
Finally some movement in this story
Solo talking about losing when he literally hasn’t won ever since beating John Cena lmao  Quite the twist though I don’t feel bad for Jimmy USO at all tbh
Jimmy should bring in jacob fatu to even the odds.
I called that s*** what did I say when he looked at Roman and said they were I will fix everything yeah there was tension behind that the rocks behind this there's a new tribal Chief in Roman Romans next call it😂
I really wouldn’t mind Paul being done with the bloodline and maybe moving on to be a counsel for bron breakker
Yet Solo has been on a losing streak,yeeeaaahhhh
Thats right solo! Thake the opportunity
Solo Sikoa vs Roman Reigns
Enough is enough, let it go guys... They are Scared of Cody Rhodes..
Crazy because Rikishi & Haku teamed back in the day..and now fast forward to 2024 and both their sons, Solo Sikoa and Tama Tonga are now together possibly forming a The New Bloodline in the New Era...🤔
The Rock behind this just imagine the Pop Roman will have when he returns
Paul "ECW" CONGRATULATIONS ON UR HALL OF FAME
USOs teaming soon?
OG Bloodline Vs New Bloodline Come Next Wrestlemania. Mark it down.
Solo going rogue.
Ladies and Gentleman….the new Wild Samoans!!!
Now we need Zilla Fatu. Trust me..he's the one. An absolute monster. If you guys haven't seen him go watch.
Thank u Triple H!!
I just start tearing up thinking about solo dad 💯
This the new BULLET CLUB the way the members are being swapped in and out!! But what makes this great IA they're actually related in this family stable. It's official WRESTLING IS COOL AGAIN 🎉
Guaranteed you Roman will feud with Solo soon
Jacob Fatu is Next, the Bloodline is rebuilding mark my words
Solo & Roman clash when he returns
Somebody tell Solo to look at his track record dude a loser himself 😂
Usos brothers reunion?
Now Jimmy bout see how it feels to be betrayed
Dafari?!!!!!
I can see Jay coming back to help reunite with his brother
Bet solo son is proud
Solo is the overpowered and over rated kid no one ever asked for
This is probably the Rock’s doing. This will end up Rock vs Roman next year.
WWE made a mistake Cody should have lost Roman deserves to break hulk Hogan record and retain the champions now WWE falling off the cliff Cody title run is going to be boring and trash
Tama Tonga, Holy!!
I just think they maybe could’ve built up solo being tribal chief more seeing that he’s never defeated LA Knight in a singles match before
Roman turning baby face/Heel Story? I'm down I love to see him be baby face and rocking heel story let's goooo
Shades of when Kish n Haku were a tag team SST in the 90s n the 2000s
50% of bullet club is in wwe
NO WAY THEY GOT TAMA TONGA!!!.
This is interesting!
Tama is good  He's 41 How long will his run last. Would it last in WWE? or will he leave after his contract expires ?
Wow didn't expect that
So is the blood line just a permanent faction now?
Yep Jimmy you might as well go on reunite with your brother Jey dawg
Tonga is officially my favorite bloodline member ‼️‼️ G.O.D‼️‼️
Fire storyline, im invested
Roman Rollins aka Tama Tonga has finally made it to WWE
Jacob Fatu will turn on Roman also next month
Nah watch, now Jimmy is gonna go with Jey, and them + Roman will deal with them, and if it comes down to it, I feel like Cody will do something ab it, as in maybe helping Roman because they're no longer enemies.
If anyone hasn't noticed, there have been ALOT of references to the shield over the past couple of years
Solo talks 😱
Ok Im in love with the bloodline again. Take my money Paul
Ohhhhh gotta see the aftermath on this one!!
Did Jimmy lose to Jey at Wrestlemania?🤔
Wheres Jacob Fatu?
Can't wait for the Jacob Fatu debut tbh
i still acknowledge my Tribal Chief
Sombody please clarify to me. Tama is Bullet Club & Cody is Bullet Club correct?
Firing Squad has entered the chat
Well we know how Jey losing his world title match now. It’s about to get REAL ASF.. This the 4th/5th inning.. they never said every one was gonna have the title involved.. this Bloodline story as I stated years ago will go down as the overall greatest storyline of all time
Their match was so bad at wm40 they gotta put them back together 😭
I mentioned bullet club betrayed him Toma but his cousin safe him . Why he betrayed his family.  The rock and Roman be back I August.  Or will this bring back the rock vs Roman at WM 42 blood line vs bloodline or bloodline vs bullet club 2.5
Bullet club is everywhere..the bloneline.. the judgment day..the elite..undisputed kingdom...🎉 4 life
And just when you thought the bloodline was over they threw a major curveball once again lol Paul Heyman was right the bloodline is only in the third inning
Bring in Jacob Fatu!!!
Turning roman face now
Oh wow what a twist
Don’t understand why they keep saying bloodline rules. It was just a no DQ match. Nothing nothing special. They miss a big opportunity
I bet Jimmy wished he stayed with jey now. When I think this story is over. Another curve ball is thrown
Bloodline: the new chapter
I wonder when Jacob Fatu will come in.... Maybe we'll see The Uso and Roman Reigns vs Fatu Solo and Tama Tonga down the line
the cinema continues..   🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So well done! Can't wait to see Solo and Tonga go wild and hopefully Jimmy and Jey find each other
I didn't know Haku had a son
This is giving Breaking Bad vibes. Paul as Saul and Solo is kind of like Todd in a way
YASS!!!
Bro what tama what about Roman
All I know, Solo, Tama and the upcoming Jacob Fatu is going to be the New Bloodline
They should've brought in Xyon Quinn for that polynesian if he never had that squash match.
One thing about WWE programming in 2025, when they move to Netflix, is we don't have to hear WWE censor out curse words.
Will "Solo" ever be solo?
Sorry, Jimmy. Looks like you and Roman have been voted off the island.
Loves you but hurts you.....crazy
the rock and the new bloodline vs Roman and the usos coming up.
Wait till Jacob Fatu joins!!! That’s next!
I can see Roman and maybe jimmy or Cody versus solo and  tama
BLOODLINE IS CRUMBLING Piece by Piece
If that’s what happens if it’s just business, I hate to see what happens when it gets personal.
Solo, Tonga & Jacob Fatu vs OG Bloodlinne 0 Civil War
Make sure you find your accountability buddy.
lol solo hasn’t won a match since he beat Cena he should have been kicked out 😂😂😂
dig the new smackdown stage
Did NOT see that coming! 😳🍿
Most of the crowd didnt even know who that was lol
ROMAN JAY AND JIMMY VS ROCK SOLO AND TAMA TONGA THE WINNERS GET PAUL HEYMAN 🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy didnt help Roman
you got fin,aj, good brothers, cody and tama tonga!¡!!!  bullet club invasion!!!
The Usos vs Solo Sikoa and Tama Tonga are coming soon
Wheres jacob
SOLO should NOT be the TRIBAL CHIEF ... he has NO Mic skills, can't cut a Promo, stands there like a SAMOAN version of KANE ... less talk, big destruction, and less entertainment. JEY USO should become the HEAD of the TABLE. JIMMY USO breaks away to build his own faction called the AIGA in SAMOAN means "FAMILY" which in our culture FAMILY is greater than BLOODLINE. There is a saying in SAMOA ... BLOODLINE makes you FAMILY, FAMILY makes you LOYAL! And in our culture, BLOODLINE has at times, clashed with FAMLY.
😂someone finally told Solo he holds the record for most PLE appearances without being on the card.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If ya smeeelllllll
OG BC
Well this is going fun reunion with the good brother and Aj and finn now that Tama Tonga is in WWE. The Uso reunite vs G.O.D make that happen please
Cody’s ‘’the tribal chief’’
Where the heck are the tribal elders?
WOW!
With family like this who needs enemies 😂
HAS SOLO LOST HIS GD MIND WTH ARE YOU DOING
For the love of God Jimmy's neck is broken 💔 😫. God Almighty 🙏, Jim Ross
When Solo broke Paul’s phone he was all like F**k this phone😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Roman named Solo the heir to the throne, Jey warned Jimmy to get out. Solo’s time has come. Jacob Fatu is on the way as well so the Bloodline story gets a new chapter.
The ark to bring the USO's back together begins.
Solo, Jacob, and Tama vs Roman and the Usos. I'm calling it now. The civil war has begun.
Jey uso should be the next tribal chief
This hasnt aired on tv yet 😯
I knew this Bloodline story would keep going!!!! Solo making a play for power while Roman's away, Jimmy seemingly being out, TAMA TONGA.   Super excited for what's to come
Solo sikoa may be the new tribal chief. Or i could be wrong
You talk like a 5th grader 3:27
Rip the bloodline say goodbye to Jimmy uso 💔💔💔 because Solo he spikes his brother his throat.
Yes
the one time I don’t watch this happens
FIRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE.  CALLLEDD IT WHEN SOLO WAS YELLING AT ROMAN TO FINISH CODY DURING WM 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Like solo ain’t ever lost 😂
This guy would mop the floor with Roman reigns
Paul's gonna have to start managing Bron Breaker for protection
YEESSSS THIS STORYLINE IS/HAS ALWAYS BEEN PURE GOLD
I'm all for it but this is more of a tag team than a faction now right? Not as dominant I would argue. Still Solo and Tonga bout to go wild
Well it’s gonna be the twins an Roman back together vs solo this dude an another member
HHH is really cooking. This is good stuff.
Well his name is “solo” it was bound to happen
3:25 "You talk like a 5th grader!"  Lmao
Not the Cell Phone 😢😢
😮😮😮
This is perfect for the solo vs Roman build up
Hmm New Bloodline? Is there anyone else they can recruit?
I hate that tama tonga 😂 I want jimmy and jey. The usos ☝️☝️
"Err, the script" is the literal 1st time in 30 years I've ever heard Paul Heyman even flub one syllable. That's a damned good track record.
What’s key is, Solo hasn’t lost when it matters. That John Cena win was HUGE.
Usos definitely gonna get back together! I want the usos back!!!
I HATE THAT BLURRED 🔇 🔕  MUTE SO MUCH!!!
And like that they write Jimmy off for the mean time. Probably Jimmy is taking time off
TAMA IS HERE. GOD FOREVER
I am excited, I need the GoD in WWE.
Jimmy and Jey will team up probably to get them like old times
I can’t wait till roman returns now and I’m watching Wwe raw and smackdown for now on Bc I’m getting tired of missing stuff 😭😭
And that's how the Usos come back for one more Title reign
I think Jimmys gonna go back to being the usos with jey turning baby face to go against solo and Tonga then they have that Jacob fotu or however you say and spell his name come when jimmy and jey take on solo and Tonga to take them out with solo and Tonga then have roman come back to help jimmy and jey his real day ones as a baby face and not a heel anymore to start his new chapter that would be sooo lit I think me and 90% if not more of the wwe universe would be so hyped and happy!!!
Bloodline Civil War.
The usos are coming back I got a feeling
Cant believe how good wwe is without vince. Vince should have been gone in 2001.
6:55 💯😮
Now it’s Jacob fatu turn
Solo trash
Things  definitely gotten interesting
Jey gonna get them watch
If “I do this because I love you” was a thing.
Now all we need is jacob fatu
OOOOOOOH!!!!!
Paul tried to call the cops 😂
There's a new Tribal Chief in town, and his name...is Solo Sikoa and a new member of the Bloodline, the debut of Tama Tonga, and then kicking out and attacking his big brother, Jimmy. 😮 ❤NO YEET!!❤
my tribal chief wouldnt stand for this
USOs back together
Rock already starting to usurp power to take control of the Bloodline from Roman. This about to be special.
YAWN
Well I guess they're going with the idea that HAKU is like an "uncle" even though technically Tama Tonga is NOT Samoan. Whatever. I'm ready for the Bloodline Civil War.  Rock, Solo, Tama, Jacob VS Roman, Jey, Jimmy, Zilla. RUN IT!
So now there's 5 ex bullet club guys in wwe....
Next Chapter..... Bloodline: Family Feud
The betrayal, how Paul was freaking out, the chair impact. highkey feels like it was written by the people who wrote Breaking Bad and im lovin it
He’s being punished for that whack match
thank God
THIS IS HOW WE GET THE USOS BACK
Roman vs solo at wrestlemania 41
This is way better then cody speech lol
It makes sense. They were foreshadowing the whole time Solo was in the ring during Roman’s match Sunday. Every time he put Cody down and Roman failed to get the pin, Solo would get angrier and angrier. Didn’t look like the anger was aimed at Cody to me.
I used to hate Solo, but am liking him now.
How manny time has solo won tho
Forget Raw after WM. This is SD after WM and they just fired on all cylinders with Tonga. Guess that means Jimmy is a face now and will try to get back with his brother.
That mean tama tonga brother will be coming
can someone give me some information on this new guy that solo brought out? 😂😂😂
Nice
Its time to acknowledge Solo Sikoa
Roman face turn incoming!!! This is PERFECT!!!
Tama should have joined up with the oc first
Yo this just got really really more interesting now
Moral of The Bloodline Story…. don’t trust the USOs or Somoans In general 😂😂😂
I hope they don't turn this into NWO vs Wolfpack. Seeming like it may go that way
I can see Roman finally going against Solo with all the built up tension these years
Roman will return as baby face which is pretty cool. Later down the road.
SOooo WWE completely ignoring that Roman bashed Seth Rollins repeatedly with a steel chair at the RR 2022
Roman coming back a baby face
Tbh. Jimmy deserve it.
Solo gets his own storyline ...  been waiting for this
Jacob fatu is a free agent to wouldn't be surprised to see him coming to wwe
A bloodline civil war, 🔥🔥🔥🔥😊
Solo acting like he hasn't lost 55 million times since he won against John Cena 😭😭😭
Can’t wait for Jacob 🔥🔥🔥
This was awesome! WWE is becoming great again.
Roman is turning babyface I can see that a mile away.....solo is going to turn on roman....solo is smart and calculating....
Finally Solo builds some character
This is absolutely BRILLIANT. Welcome to WWE, Tama Tonga!! That was too sweet! 🤘☝️
They'll have to rebuild the Island 🏝 of Relevancy
Tama Tongaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!
Solo definitely the new tribal chief he aint taking no more orders from Roman 💯 now he running things & Tama now in the mix WWE ur finally doing something right for once
So is roman going to comeback as a face?
There's still 2 more too 🔥🔥🔥 the young boys vs the ogs is gone be insane.
So Jey and Jimmy back together soon?
New Era ‼️🔥🔥🔥
Redemption Arch coming for the Tribal Chief ☝️
Could be a Final Boss call... Never know.
Wooow!!! I love this
Jacob going after Jey next
How many people just wish Roman came out there and said “Solo what are you doing?”
Turning Roman and jimmy face to fued with Solo and Tama sounds amazing Triple H did say there were taking Roman in a surprising direction
Is Jimmy gonna leave the bloodline now? Is he gonna go back to his brother?
Solo taking over the bloodline means fatu coming soon as well. It's going to soon be fatu, sikoa, and tonga vs reigns, and the usos at wrestlemania 41. 👀👀
I can see this is roman new bloodline and the rock will have jimmy and jay as his bloodline
People that want the USOS to reunite  👇🏻
TAMA!!!
Are we going to ignore that Solo's lost every match for like the last 6 months while they're building it to being the rock as the new tribal chief it would be an interesting double turn if it comes and turns out to be Jay
G.O.D has landed!
This is so Good ✨💥✨❣️💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is so Good ✨💥✨❣️💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is so Good ✨💥✨❣️💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
They already did a bloodline civil war so part 2 or shield incoming
That about to NWO the bloodline into the grave
The Bloodline continues..
This I what happened when Shaw lost to Austin and Triple H    Came the leader of DX
𝐔𝐡 𝐨𝐡
New look Bloodline with Solo, Tonga & Jacob Fatu is gonna be ill...
I like this angle already
It was a matter of time before they turned Solo loose!! Let's see how this turns out
Solo finally bouta breakthrough
I’m ngl without Roman in the bloodline this is just gonna be another useless faction unless they can make an interesting story
The bloodline is now blood dry
This seem like the Usos are returning and basically the bloodline is split up
The rock is reshaping the bloodline and using solo to do it
I Can't wait for Money in the Bank_! Please don't let no mid card jobbers win it most definitely needs to be McIntyre 💯
Jimmy Face turn coming soon
He could have hit both of them with the chair but who’s counting right?
Roman reigns turns face and the rock vs Roman reigns wrestlemania 41 2025
I'm going to pre it rn Jey will come go smackdown and help Jimmy then they will hug it out
Ok lets get Tanga Loa in there as well.....I've always wanted to see the USO's vs G.O.D.
Jacob Fatu is going to round out the squad
Why Solo sikoa attack Jimmy uso that's ur brother. 😮
Wow 👀🔥🔥👀
Jimmy probably drafted to raw
I thought its was jeffy hard for a split second lmao
Umaga has returned in the form of Solo Sikoa
Wow!!! Tama is on SmackDown!!
New bloodline Coming!!!!
I like the new look for SmackDown! 🔥 It's less big and less the same as generic stages today
Usos getting back together now. Wait on it.
Solo was named tribal prince not that long ago
I see Paul wearing his ring 🙂
Solo will mess up the BloodLine and Roman will have to come back to take the BloodLine back.
Yes thank you hhh. It’s about time solo rises up and become a star
Now add Jacob Fatu to that lineup and now you have   Sikoa, Tonga, and Fata vs Reigns and the Usos in a true bloodline civil war
Paul don't know what to do or 🤔😮 think
Will jey come help him
Roman coming back as a face.
Yoooo!!!!! Wtf!!! Tama Tonga?!
They're gonna bring Fatu and make a new Bloodline
Nobody cares about solo
Let's goooooo. Tonga in the bloodline!!!!
Where was bro at wrestlemania
Upgrade,,,, Ping!!!!!!!
Bloodline Civil War Part 2 coming soon
I don’t think Solo is done yet either. Jacob Fatu is probably going to be joining the gang here real soon.
Solo just neno brown jimmy
U have got to be kidding me
Well…….., Solo…… is taking over!
What until y’all see Jacob Fatu
Ahh snap so they gon turn on Roman when he comes back👀
I'm calling it, Jimmy and Jey will reunite to take on the Bloodline again
The show isn't even over yet WTF is goin on
Solo sikoa:you fail at wrestlemania    Everybody:didn't the entire bloodline fail at  wrestlemania
🤣 Ross Will Say: Oh My!
Can we get Roman reigns vs Solo sikoa
👀
The way Jimmy looked behind him like someone came to the ring with him 😂😂😂😂 yes you
Rip   Press F for respects   Press S to spit on Jimmys grave
Ngl..Babyface bloodline Roman,Jey,Jimmy idc what yall say
So I'm guessing Jacob Fatu is coming next?
I have a gut feeling that soon Paul turn on Herman and became solos guy very soon and then Roman turns baby face
I was expecting Solo to bring Umaga’s son not Tama
PAPÁ H IS COOKINGGGG🔥 Bloodline Civil War part II
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NEW TRIBAL CHEIF SOLO
Having Roman admit he lost fair and square with no excuses through Heyman is a good first step to turning him babyface.
Hello
Bring back Roman reigns please solo is taking over now
This has The Rock written all over !!!
paul heyman  face turn?
What ever
I'm elated to see Tama in WWE but if Solo is the new boss of Bloodline, then I think this is misuse of Tama unfortunately
SOLO SIKOA takes Paul as his Wiseman?????
Looking forward to how the wwe writers put this together over the next several weeks
Looks like Jimmy gonna have to do some serious apologizing to Jey🤭
so jimmy just gonna keep being a jobber ..
If you know anything about the history between Sam Mullins and Tongans, having him join at Tongan in the bloodline is highly unlikely, but for the sake of Polynesian unity and the history of their families, I’m sure it’ll make a good storyline
I was waiting for the too sweet☝️ 🥲
Wait, why are Gallows and Anderson down in NXT!?
Tama Tonga is gonna be the real deal of WWE and of the bloodline
Oooo boyyy, this storyline just took a different turn. The best way to debut Tonga imo. Solo taking over the Bloodline is great too.
The Usos reunion!
Roman is most definitely getting turned on when he comes back 😂
Oh they’re gettin both the belts… bulllleed dat!
Funny how Solo talks about losing and winning when he haven’t won a match on since John Cena match 😂
Does this mean Roman is gonna get jumped when he comes back?
Hayman himslf  set that up😂
Roman lost the title due to long-term storytelling
Tonga look like a smaller version of roman if u squint
The Tribal Thumb
I was expecting Jacob Fatu to debut but Tonga is also great.
Interisting
Bloodline Civil War Part 2, I’m definitely here for it. Roman gotta comeback and put an end to all of this I’m seeing the vision.
Tama Tonga is just keeping the seat warm for the real savior of the Bloodline: Jacob Fatu.
Ngl seeing Tonga in wwe made me tear up a lil. Dude deserves this
The BloodLine is more dangerous now than ever
I think Solo and Tama would make a great team. Hopefully the WWE will take them very far
Solo ain’t it.  That Samoan Spike ain’t it.
They about to be called New Blood
Im more interested to see where this goes than I am to see where codys reign goes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
new storylines just stay it  i feel like jimmy might go back  to Jey    no way solo the new tribal   chief
The blame game continues on WWE lol tribal chief Roman reigns hahaha
Roman Reigns is out of the bloodline?!
Solo went rouge😳
I'm 100% here for this. Come on Jacob
Who da fook is that guy ??
It all makes sense now remember the bloodline family tree
“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO THE BLOODLINE WE OWN THE WRESTLING WORLD TAMA TONGA SOLO SIKOA  JACOB FATU THE ROCK BELIEVE IN THE BLOODLINE. BELIEVE IN US.”
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Finally solo going to turn against Roman reigns lol
Yessssss! Finally!
Im speechless 😶
could we see roman vs solo
He tried to call the tribal chief🤣🤣🤣
So solo, Tonga and rock vs reigns, jimmy and possibly Jey?
If this leads to face Roman and Jimmy vs Heel Solo and Tama, im all for it
"Losing has consequences." -The guy with an 8 month long losing streak😂
This what we all been waiting for🔥
ROMAN REIGNS BABY FACE TURN ❤❤❤❤❤
Phase 4 has just begun    The Aftermath
Stupid Paul
Giving dx vibes when Triple H kicked Micheals out the group after losing to stone cold.
And solo smatched pauls phone like oh no your not calling the tribal chief
Aww Jimmy...ain't right! 🤬
This story is about family jealousy. NICE ROMAN ❤❤🎉
YES YES YES! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And so begins the Bloodline Civil War II
Solo will be Roman's first Babyface opponent. He will lose Jacob fatu interference Roman will fued with the Bloodline after the rock is revealed as the new leader. And he will fued with bloodline him and Jimmy and jey until mania against the rock  I knew solo was first the way he was yelling at Roman at mania.
Jacob Fatu is next
Solo is not finished if he meant there is consequences for the ones who lost at wrestlemania. Jimmy got his consequences now Roman will get his consequences by solo and the new bloodline.
44444 LIIIIFE!!!! 👆🏿👆🏿👆🏿👆🏿
WHAT😮 okay since jimmy uso got kicked out of bloodline yeah i think it's time for the usos put aside the difference reunite since the draft is around the corner no telling what's gonna happen
Cinema.
From NJPW to WWE. We welcome Tama Tonga.
Jimmy going back to his brother because he have nobody to be with now
Let's go tonga
Haha no more bloodline , Roman was crushed at wrestlemania 😂😂😂😂
Solo, Tama Tonga, and Jacob Fatu vs. Roman Reigns and the Usos. Bloodline Civil War!
This is what we get when the WWE writers have no fear that 100s of hours of writing and brainstorming will be changed 2 minutes before teh show
This crazy 😂😂 Jim getting kicked out by lil bro 😂
☝🏾☝🏾
Just when I thought Smackdown was gonna be boring 🔥🔥🔥
Solo can finally be a character
wha wha what.......what tf just happened?
The bloodline story is getting reheated wow never thought i see tama tonga in wwe
Solo turned on his brother
😂😂😂
Jacob Fatu is next that one will really be the start of the new Bloodline😂
WOW!!!!❤❤❤ HERE'S MY WIFE N MY MONEY. TAKE IT!!! IM IN!!
I do wonder now. What will be Jey's response to this on Raw?
Am I my brother's keeper?!......
Solo needs a new finisher.
Solo New Bloodline  Leader
Seems like a setup for the Usos to get back together. This is an interesting turn of events.
Guessing Jacob Fatu also joins eventually
I like solo but he a joke for this. He  lost a thousand straight. Jacob fatu will be next.. Bad story telling
Now Jey and Jimmy reunites.
Wow!!! Didn't see that coming, or Tama coming in. Hayman highjacked from Roman. This is about to get interesting
Where's Solo's punishment then?
Now you know how it feels to be betrayed Jimmy 😡😡😡😠😠😠
Honestly if anyone should be punished it's Solo. He hasn't won a single match since he beat John Cena. Mans has a 38 match losing streak
This storyline potenial is massive   Roman can come back with a newly reunited USOs and we get Bloodline civil war without Rock even involved or you could have Solo be Rocks informant and boom you got Roman and Rock as captains in civil war.....
Paul a** so confused and speechless he don't know what to do!! Oh Jey gonna save his TWIN!! WATCH!
We could see the other uso zilla fatu
Civil War! Bloodline vs the New Blood
Is Tonga really coming to WWE?
Nobody is going to be ready for Tama Tonga
Next thing you know Jey is gonna be saving Jimmy
Bottom line is this solo betrays Jimmy and now a new Samoan from Japan who's joined the bloodline and debut on SmackDown
So Paul Heyman confirms wwe is on a script😊
So this is how Jimmy hooks back up with Jey.
When he comes back, Roman is gonna be a huge babyface.
😠I thought no more bloodline
Knew this was gonna happen now i fully believe Jey will beat Priest and Jimmy is gonna help him win
😮😮😮😮
Roman Reigns is turning Face
........ THIS IS AWESOME !!!! .... fake wrestling  is lame, but this ... this is lit
i cannot wait for a Toma Tonga promo that is going to be 🔥 🔥
Finally toma tonga in wwe business just picked up.  The new blood line is here. Waiting on tonga loa
😲 WOW!
We all know deep down we miss Roman
New era new bloodline
The Bloodline will be back fully together when Rock returns
Jimmy better apologize to jey and join him to move out of bloodline for good
Gonna love the eventual Roman vs Solo
Jimmy is going to return don’t worry guys
the usos ruined the super kick
I'm sensing the Usos we'll be back together soon
Solo sikoa awesome great good going great wwe
Technically Solo was set to inherit the throne
ACKNOWLEDGE SOLO!!!
Oh god.
Now Jimmy Uso got what *he* deserved! Turning on Jey Uso was strike 1. Costing Jey Uso the Intercontinental Championship was Strike 2, now as of WrestleMania 40, losing to Jey, Strike 3! And with this attack, Jimmy's out!
One half of the guerillas of destiny
Just for the record Jimmy got what he deserved at first but now I feel bad for him
should have been Jacob fatu wwe selling the spot again.
I mean they been leaving dude hanging on dap for a year and half now
Here I was thinking Tama was going to NXT to mix with The Good Brothers maybe and Jacob was the next member of the Bloodline
After what he did to his twin brother, no sympathy for Jimmy. Jey warned him.
This is like when Triple H took over DX and brought in X-Pac after HBK got injured
Yep that’s it THE USOS ARE COMING BACK BABY
So is Jimmy out the bloodline?
Jey is going to get involved soon
I kinda saw it coming.. maybe not sure 🤔
Tama Tonga is G.O.D thank you HHH for Tama 💪🏽
Who?
The usos need to reunite
Dude talking about losing needs consequences when he lost like 30 times in a row.
So if this is Jimmy's punishment, then what will be Roman's, Paul looked scared, no $#!+
I KNOW YOU PHUCKING LYING!! YEP,SOLO OUT OF CONTROL for this !! Tama bro...over ya brother!!   This story line bout to cook cook COOK FOR REAL!!! ANY WHOOT, WE READDDDDDDY!!
G.O.D 2.0 IS HERE ☝🏼
TAMA TONGA WTF
I knew this guy from Japan wrestling was coming and welcome him to WWE and The Bloodline too.Jimmy is out group again and end Paul Heyman cell phone to call his Boss.Solo call the shots now.💙🤍🖤📱
Toma vs jey is gonna be crazy
Good for Tama. Now he's the 4th person I care about in WWE. I'll follow what he does, have been since NJPW.
This is awesome love Tama Tonga. Really hope this leads to Jacob Fatu now calling the shots. We can get team Reigns vs team Fatu civil war. Reigns, Jimmy and Jey vs Jacob Fatu, Solo, and Tonga.
Solo & Tama vs Jimmy & Jey is gonna be 🔥
The USO's have to get back together now🎉🎉🎉
Solo finally speaks up and now he's bout to beat some sense into someone and now more bloodline mess went 2.0 on his own flesh and blood😮😮😮😮😮😮
Solo took over the Bloodline and took out Jimmy with Tama Tonga. He did it for the Rock.
That's that's him he's the guy from the Japan wrestling the video I 4 weeks ago I watched
They keep talking about Roman finally getting revenge on Rollins with the chair but didn’t he smash Rollins with the chair when they faced at royal rumble
Solo said losing and winning matters.but lost every match since he beat Cena
Yall have no idea how good Tama Tonga is….he literally made the Bullet Club what it is today.
Why is solo getting mad at losing when he’s lost like 37 times now 😂
I can’t wait the uso reunite tag team 🥹🥹🥹
Don’t solo lose all the fn time????
Jimmy turns face?
Who is the dude other cousin
And you know big Jake is coming in.
Roman already said once he lose his title he's leaving and solo taking his place
Solo & Tonga vs. Jimmy & Roman at Backlash?
War Games at Survivor Series Roman, Cody Rhodes and The Uso's vs The Rock, Solo and Tama Tonga and someone else
TAMA TONGA WHAAAATTTT
TAMA TONGA THE FORMER MEMBER OF NEW JAPAN PRO WRESTLING SUPERSTAR JOINS WWE
It’s about time WWE did something with Solo, i’m all for it
Bloodline Civil War
Return of the usos
nooooooo scratch that yessss yeet !
Hey there 😉 Have you seen this? THE ENFORCER is now calling himself TRIBAL CHIEF 🤔 WTF is going on? 😂
Seth vs roman is going to be amazing
Old Bloodline vs New Bloodline incoming.
Well bloodline story just got a new twist.....
I’m kinda confused is Jimmy a baby face now? Or is Solo?
First and foremost, I acknowledge solo that there’s new members joining and old members are out if they fail
Naomi better not find out what Solo Sakoa did to Jimmy Uso.
I died laughing when they turned on Jimmy I knew it was coming
1st comment! 1st view!
I love how he was acting like Roman he is growing up guys 🥹🥹
I didn’t expect tama Tonga to show up
6th apparently
☝️☝️
!YEET!
Poor jimmy bro
Seeing Solo Sakoa take over the Bloodline by bringing in Tama Tonga, brutalize Jimmy Uso, and Hyjacking Paul Heyman made me feel all warm and fuzzy in my tum tum.
who is the new guy with paul ❤❤
NOBODY CARES IF YOUR FIRST
Solo is the baby of the group so you know that he's got some rage in there. He's going to be a threat to everyone
TONGA IS HERE!!!! Choosing Tonga over Jimmy is INSANE
Roman Reigns is finally gone
Love how they kept the Tama Tonga name to him
Roman: *loses at Wrestlemania*  Solo Sikoa: Finally, I'm free!
1 like=100 pushups
Solo is wrong for doing that to jimmy
Yes I been waiting on this since day one about mf time 😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯💯
There's no way bro 😭 turning on Jimmy and debuting Tonga is crazy 🔥🔥🔥
Let’s go!!!!
You will acknowledge Solo Sikoa! ☝️☝️☝️☝️
Cinema! Best Solo segment yet.🔥
So we’re getting the rocks bloodline vs Roman’s bloodline in a civil war? Take my money now
