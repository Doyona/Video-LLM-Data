Saffron, would your brother like to follow a fitness coach who I can recommend. He provides diet & exercise guidance and gets people off their medication with recovery and rehabilitation. Let me know 🙂
Love this vid Saff! It’s so honest and straight from your heart! Love you my precious! 😍😍❤️😍😍😍🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
Probably not related but government now saying from 12th feb under 50s NOT eligible for covid vaccination. Not for a good reason either no matter how they try to paint it
More heart problems due to well do I have to say it ? Controversial
💕🙏
Super Bowl
love your videos any advice for a new youtuber?!
Believe me I feel you pain lately. My grandad/best friend died last week and it has me down
My nan had a heart attack and died they revived her and then Christmas eve she found out that she won't make it and decided to let go ... Worst Christmas ever
Omg Casey is 27 it dont half make you stop and think that...Im 48....had addiction  issues.... an eating disordered past and then you look at Casey younger and what you think of as fitter than me.....🙏
Omg sry to hear that. That is scary. Poor Casey. Horrible to hear about your grandad too. awful. Very worrying no matter how positive you are. Time will heal. Chin up xx
I really hope casey is ok❤️🥺 I would love to see a video of you printing out everything and see you making your vision board🥰🥰
Big love to your brother! My dad was 28 when he had his massive heart attack and died. This was in 1982. Thank god the medical technology has advanced since my dad and your brother is still here.
It’s called the covid vaccine in case anyone is wondering.
Vision board vlog PLSSSSSS 🤩 xx
I haven't had the best few months either my mum had the exact same surgery and she's 51 and been though cancer and 2 sets of heart attacks
Hope they both get well soon
Oh my god!! 😱 Thank god Casey is okay.
So sorry about your brother 😞 x he is so young and this shouldn't be happening..  it's time questions were asked why so many people so young are having strokes and heart attacks ...in fact people of all ages...and so many died suddenlys ..whats changed in the last few years?.  What medical procedure has the majority of people had?....watch Dr John Campbell on you tube!!
Did they take the vaccines Saffron?..
Was he vaxxed by any chance?
I sent u a pm on Instagram please read it. ❤️
Your so pretty!! any chance you are going there to ski in February
trash!
Super Bowl in Feb 😊
Glad your brother and family is in prayers going up to them .
Sending Well wishes to your wonderful family, Life can be so cruel, and I really hope things will improve for you all soon. Health has to always come first, and you are so right the most important things in life are the little things, I really hope people remember this from Covid! It certainly changed us and the way we view life and want our life's to be! x
I really hope your grandad & Casey are makin a speedy recovery ❤❤

Wait, you're going to watch the Superbowl??? 🤭🤭
why do people care when others want children that’s such a personal question and quite rude to ask. not everyone wants to have children young….
I’m so sorry and Casey is in my thoughts! I lost my brother from a heart attack 2 years ago and he was only 26 and he has 4 children that now don’t have a dad. Life is so cruel 😭
“Worst month of my life” makes video whilst sitting in her million pound house wearing expensive shit this girl ain’t got issues just attention seeking and I greatful asf
Sending love to you all 💖💖
Sorry to hear about your brother and grandad 🙏 hope they feel better soon.  They have great support from you and your family.
So sorry for the scary experiences that you and your family have had to go through recently. You're all absolutely amazing for supporting each other the way you are doing. Sending so much love and healing energy 💕
Sending best wishes and prayers for you and your family <3
Yes manifest your dreams. Yes you get pictures from free prints love vision boards
Sending lots of love to you and your family ❤❤❤
Who cares
I lost my older brother 10 years ago to a heart attack when I was 13😥 I’m so thankful Casey got to the hospital on time ♥️
Lost of prayer ❤
JUST WANT TO SAY TO ANYONE WHO IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING KEEP BELIEVING,& BELIEVE & TRUST IN HIM Keep trusting God , Keep Your Faith , Keep Praying  , Keep going to church ,keep listening to worship music, & keep reading the Bible ,& and remember , The Lord is Bigger Than your Problems , Everything going to be ok , just keep praying & talking to him ,💕💕MAY GOD BLESS YALL& EVERYONE IN JESUS NAME AMEN 💕😊
A lot of sudden heart attacks from october - january. Right when they roll out the clot shot boosters.
I’d recommend reporting Casey’s heart attack to the yellow card, A LOT of young people have suffered heart attacks/strokes etc after the covid vaccines. It’s actually getting scary, I’d also recommend researching it as the media won’t report any of it (for obvious reasons 🐑). FYI it’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s literally happening in the courts right now, Pfizer was even forced to release all the side effects that the vaccines caused with much more info to come.
I'm so sorry to hear about your brother and grandad I really hope there OK after boxing day we found out that my grandad has cancer and only has weeks left and then last Thursday my uncle passed away of a heart attack I'm just praying this year get better but I'm sending all my love and thoughts to you all xxxxx
Saff im so sorry that you and your family have gone through so much in the past month I really do send my love to each and every one of you❤️ when I see about Casey’s heart attack I got a bit tearful and it made me tearful seeing you try to be strong in this video ❤️ I’m so sorry you also had to witness your grandads seizure I can’t imagine how that must of been but I think it’s amazing that you and your family are all supporting eachother, looking after Casey, Nicole and the children and also supporting your grandad ❤ I hope you are all okay and I hope things get better for you all x
I’m so sorry for everything that’s happened. All my prayers and love to you and your family, keeping Casey in my prayers 🌸
Has she had her teeth done Recently???
I’m currently in Hospital due to Heart failure I’m 38 😢 I hope your brother gets better x x x
Sending my love, I’m so thankful they got saved ❤️
Girl your beautiful know watching you years and to see how far you came with your own house and everything motives me you inspire me keep doin you ❤️
Lots of prayers for both your brother and grandfather.  In the past 2 years my husband first had 2 seizures, a brain tumor and then a heart attack.  These events changed our lives tremendously.  I also pray for your family, these things affect everyone not just the person that suffered the event.
Sending so many prayers to Casey and your family!! We missed you Saff! ❤
I feel for you, 6th January I lost my step mum, suddenly and unexpectedly. I feel disconnected from the world just like you said. Stay positive we got this! Sending love to casey and your grandad x
It’s NEVER to late to do a vision board Saff!!   Also I’m so sorry to hear about Casey… I had a H/A at the age of 31 (I will b 39 this yr) n although it changed my life it’s given me a different outlook on my life n the other health conditions I’ve had n fought several times since birth… I’ve just had a new tattoo that says “You are stronger than you think you are” done because it is so true n it’s one I need to remember more… I’m keeping the whole family in my thoughts and prayers xxxx
I’m so glad that your older brother Casey survived his heart attack I’m so sorry to hear about that happening to him and right after Christmas as well keeping him and you all in my thoughts and prayers ❤❤
As someone who was born with a heart defect and that currently suffers from arrhythmias and also has to have tablets for the rest of my life I can completely sympathise with Casey and your family. It must have been very scary for all of you. I'm really glad everything went okay and I wish him and your family the very best❤️
You and Ana should do a Galentines Gift Swap! That would be insane xx
Keeping Casey and all your fam in my thoughts 🙏🏼💛
Can we talk about how mature saffron is? like WOW we’ve all watched her grow up from a teenage school girl to this mature (and can i mention absolutely GORGEOUS) young lady!
Saffron I’m so so sorry for everything that’s happened I’ve watched you for years and don’t usually comment. But all I can say is everything can only go up from here, both your family are on the route to recovery and your smashing life no matter what, the fact your even recording this video so soon is a mark on your strength and resilience. Sending all my love and prayers for a speedy recovery for both Casey and your Grandad. ❤
No one’s talking about Saffron’s new teeth? They look great!
Are you going to Arizona for the Super Bowl?!
Sending them both all my love I’m so sorry that all this has happened to you and your family. Sending you a big hug too ❤xxxx
‘Thanks whoever is u there’? You either believe in God or you don’t! You can’t expect to mock the existence of God and also expect him to answer your prayers! That wasn’t nice at all! ‘Thanks whoever’.
❤️🙏
Sending my love to Casey and your grandad ❤hopefully they get well soon
Your hair looks beautiful and love your necklace xxxx
Why do people care so much about bf and gf omg so overwhelming 😭 what a question
Really sorry saffron hope everything is going to be OK massive hugs 🫂 🤗 sending love and strength for your brother and grandad ❤️ ♥️ 💙 💖 💕 I love watching your brother and Nicole there awesome parents such a inspirational family 👪 ❤️ 💖 xxxxxxx
Hi Saffron, my husband had a suspected heart attack on Christmas Day. I feel you pain. I hope Casey is ok. Family means the world to me. Keep strong xx
You & anastasia should do a "galentines" day pressie swap instead🤷‍♀️🤣
So sorry to hear about Casey and your Grandad, wishing you and your family all the best for this year. Your health is your wealth 💛
Praying for you and your family 💞
You literally had a NYE party a few days after his heart attack happened
I recommend that you do your research and make sure what you are saying is accurate before you post videos like this. Heart attacks cause the brain to be deprived of oxygen, not the opposite (which is what you said)
Sorry to hear about your brother. Yet another young person whose suffered a heart attack. 💉
yep u said extro and intro vert right
how did u meet libby
what utubers do u follow
how much are coachella tickets
ahhh why arizona>
yes for the dog!
first off, i just wanted to say that i'm very sorry to hear about all the horrible things that have happened to your family in the past month and i would never wish that on anyone. Also, out of love i have to tell you that the One whom you were pointing to when you said " thank....whoever.. up there " that would be God and His name is Jesus Christ. He is very much a real person and, Saffron, He loves you very much. So much, in fact, that 2,000 years ago He came to earth for the specific purpose of giving His life on the cross as payment for all the sins of mankind. that means, of course, that He paid for your sins too. Not only that, after giving His life on the cross, He then rose again from the grave three days later and then went back up to Heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father where He always lives to make intercession. So, Saffron, if you will just believe in what Jesus did for you and ask Him to forgive you of your sins, then you can have the gift of eternal life and then, the moment that happens, the Holy Spirit of God will come and indwell ( live inside of ) you and you will be a brand new creation. Also, you'll never be truly alone ever again. i say truly because yes, you may have times where you're physically alone but, you'll never be totally alone ever again. i've been a Christian for 17 years as of this April and i can tell you it is the Best decision i ever made. so, please at least consider Jesus and His offer of salvation. P.S. while the offer of salvation is free to all who will accept it, if a person chooses to reject that offer and they go their whole life rejecting Jesus, then there will be nothing left for that person except to spend all of eternity apart from God in suffering and torment. the choice is yours.

Sending best wishes to casey and your grandad i will be praying for them and your family xx
I lost my mum suddenly back in September and I feel the exact same. I just feel so lost and just want to fully disconnect from the world. My mum and I were very big on that work and materialistic things aren’t important spending quality time with family is and I hate that we were proven right because tbh times never enough but I spent everyday with my mum and I’m so glad. ❤️
I’m glad your brother and grandfather are better 💕 would love you to do a vision board video 💕💕 you are so sweet, can’t wait to see your travel vlogs 💕💕💕 went to Nashville last month and had seen your vlog there just before I went 💕💕❤️
I hope your Grandad is okay!
I hope your brother is okay!
Really appreciate your honesty. And these touch times are lessons and little bumps in the path of time. You are doing so well to get through, keep pushing, keep dreaming, keep striving xx
I wonder if Casey had the vaccine? Seeing mor and more cardiac issues in young people these days- it’s scary! Sending love to you all x
I'd love to watch a video of making a vision board also sending love to your family❤
A bad start makes for a good finish. Wishing good health to your family, what an awful time yous have had. X
Could we talk about the fact you're still supporting a hairdresser in Brighton that's scammed hundreds of girls out of money that you promoted and you're still using her?
So sorry you are going through all that☹️ life is so up and down and I hope you all have a positive rest of the year xx

Your family is always so supportive. You all are always working and hustling and still smiling!  People thrive on your personalities and good looks! Your brothers smile always made me happy so did Casey, Nihole, your sister, and Jed. Awsome Brighton bunch!!!! We love you Saffi B!!!
Praying for your brother and Grandpa for a fast recovery, praying for you and the rest of the family to stay healthy.  Are you going to a marathon in Arizona?
Prayers for your family!  Hoping that the rest of the year is the best ever!
Glad to hear that your brother is getting better
Actually  -  I think you have forgotten that you were seriously sick when you came to the States for a visit.   So I would say that was much worse...
Well wishes to your brother and grandad❤

So sorry you and your family have been through such a tough time especially with it being a new year! Wishing Casey and your grandad a speedy recovery ❤
Thank GOD all is well x 🙏🏽❤
Hey, I have such similar experience with my brother (he was only 30) last year, nearly the same day (28th) and exact same onset symptoms. I was in Australia and getting that call was just the worst thing. I am an ICU nurse  so not sure if having medical knowledge was a blessing or a curse. I hope Cassey doing well a year on my brother life is still so different he is left with heart failure now but getting stronger day by day. If you have any question even as a previous sister or as nurse reach out. Also if there is a strong family history might be worth getting yourself checked out too, not urgently but reach out to your GP, I got a full cardiology work up just in case.
sending prayers to casey and your grandad- can’t imagine what you’re going through right now❤
I’m so sorry to hear you’ve had a bad start to the year 😢 I’m Glad Casey is on the mend and your grandad is well, sending them my love & best wishes 🥰💙 Welcome back to YouTube, we’ve missed you ❤

I'm so sorry to hear this saffron. I hope they're ok. Also I get the feeling of having seizures. I've been diagnosed and on medication for my epilepsy since 2021. I hate when I have seizures. My very first seizure was in 2017. I hate the confusion I face after my absence seizures. I do epilepsy awareness on my twitter and do believe it's important for those out there to know but, coming more from your side, I hope they're both doing ok.

Saffron I’m so so sorry for everything that’s happened I’ve watched you for years and don’t usually comment. But all I can say is everything can only go up from here, both your family are on the route to recovery and your smashing life no matter what, the fact your even recording this video so soon is a mark on your strength and resilience. Sending all my love and prayers for a speedy recovery for both Casey and your Grandad. ❤
Sending lots of love to you all ❤
Oh goodness. I am so sorry to hear this happened. Wishing Casey and your grandad a speedy recovery. Lots of love to you all xx
It’s NEVER to late to do a vision board Saff!!   Also I’m so sorry to hear about Casey… I had a H/A at the age of 31 (I will b 39 this yr) n although it changed my life it’s given me a different outlook on my life n the other health conditions I’ve had n fought several times since birth… I’ve just had a new tattoo that says “You are stronger than you think you are” done because it is so true n it’s one I need to remember more… I’m keeping the whole family in my thoughts and prayers xxxx
I hope your OK Saffron you have so much support and fans that love you so much can't wait for another video and I hope Casey gets well I love you 💞💞
