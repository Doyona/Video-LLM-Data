This shit still hard
Loss to Deji, KSI & Pineda lol 😂. I doubt he’ll beat Mcbroom, Weller but it’s possible. Him beating Jake and Logan isn’t happening
Didn’t age well
Damn
3:00
Cold buisness
FIREEEEEE❤‍🔥
what happened to bro
Swarmz v Pineda should have been the real fight
muad
Swarmz can refuse to try and still make a disstrack better than KSI’s Ares lmao
I think y’all forgot he’s an artist ☠️☠️
The song hit harder than Swarmz did against Ed Matthews.
Swarmz got cooked💀
still come back to this song. it's swarmz' hardest song
It's mad that he predicted his win over Ryan Taylor 💀
Running mouth like kamaru the Nigerian American guy
Bobby lashley running mouth like a madman
Still the hardest Swarmz song
Boys need to just stick to rapping
Deji smoked you now. He’s not the target now 😂
This song goes hard
Deji smoked you know. He’s not the target now 😂
Still got Deji up on my radar hittin a little harder rn 😂
Nah rewatching this is mad, bro might be from the future, hes fighting deji and at 1:30 he swung his left hand at ryans eyeball and won
HUGE BANGER, MY MAN!
Why is bro saying idiot pineda , PINEDA RULES EVERYONE EVEN TYSON FURY
My boy swarmz listen to em everyday before I workout to get a good vibe in ayeee madman madman

1:31 Ryan Taylor👀👀
1:30 Swarmz called it against Ryan Taylor tho. Goddamn!!

For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.   (2 John 1:7) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus Christ, Repent and be saved.

Never disappoint respect for Swarmz
Fire song 🔥
Respect to tko. Taking advantage of his fame and showing everyone the real talent he has. Keep it up tko
Austin got repossessed got me crying😂
Swarmz: 1. Your editor needs to learn (after observing the lyrics) basic spelling and in some cases grammar. 2. You need to pull your trousers up mate, maybe go a size smaller Just trying to help out, no problem mate
He’s calling out everyone while he lost his fight
This guy is so smart for calling everyone out. Get that money brother!
For real his bars are rubbish sorry
Vamos

Spelt “radar” wrong
“ Half Bajan “ 🇧🇧 💪🏽
this man deserves more subs this is bs lol
repeated bars, repeated beat, lame digs. this is bad bruh.
u could tr fighting a 4 year old
just gonna skip over the fact he said he would shoot joe 😂😭
Mum said I should go invest (Invest) Austin, he got repossessed If you're bad, yo, brudda come speak with chest If you don't step right, then you might get left (My man) How can you leave your girlfriend stressed? Now your kids homeless, don't you think that's f'd? But the prick's hopelеss, must be smoking meth Thought you had Hovis, but you must have lеss Who's that bredda? Joe Weller Don't lemme go and grab for the leather Big .44, no safety sweater The kickback huge, come big like Heather Two weeks straight, man collected cheddar Punch man up like whatever the weather (My man) Joe wasn't talking when we was together Put us in the ring, I'ma show man pressure Jordan, Harvey, forget Wassabi I was in the party, tryna get narni (Ayy, yo) Then I got a call from Mams, KSI Kristen Hanby, I ain't gonna lie Corns gonna fly, are you tryna die? Send him to the sky, I ain't tryna hear replies Let me give advice if I pull up with the guys Me n' you ain't really size if I swing a hefty right Still got Deji up on my radar Don't take man for idiot, Pineda Can everyone please do me a favour? (What's that?) Leave me to count all my paper Two-two favour, swing jaw breaker Half Bajan but I rep Jamaica Businessman, but I love my paper Don't play games, nah, this ain't the Sega Bryce Hall, you could never be an idol Bryce Hall, after the fight you'll need a bible Austin clapped you, how suicidal When I beat man up, man, I want my title Jordan fly like, Michael, Vital, coming like a cycle Roll with the mandem moving tribal If I swing my left hand at his eyeball He ain't on it, just be honest Lock shit down like my name is Boris Any little yute, man, you need some porridge Their heart ain't in it, they need some courage Yo, upfront like Kane and Sturridge (Yo) Yeah, they hate, but they don't pay 'omage Dropped out of school and I didn't go college Wrapped up a fool and his bitch gave me knowledge
This hardcd
This… guy on the suit is making me really uncomfortable 😂
Bro got folded in the ring but mad respect in his music
This guy is a clown 🤡
You can’t talk like this after getting dropped 😂
🛌 this you?
Clout chaser
swarmz
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.   (1 John 2:15-17) - Repent. The LORD Jesus Christ is coming soon.
NDL
Too good
ksi had made you blow my guy 🔥
Hardd
Swarmz Vs Kristen Hanby
L fighter W artist
Tell me this don’t go hard
Madman
THIS GUY PREDICTS THE FUTURE
Now that the fight announcement has come out this is so much more fire
Violation brudah stop i cannot beileve you turned this L into the biggest w ever

This tune is FIRE 🔥
w swaamz
Are you really ready for your next fight ??? Do work hard bro  I want a big W from you please !!  You got this!
this song is actually fire 🔥🔥🔥
this fire fr
That white guy had a over size head 🤨or i'm tripping homie???
'if you don't step right than you might get left' He copied this bar from Ruben J Clarke. Maybe he also wrote it but unlikely. Whe someone throws a left (a punch ) u step right to dodge it is the double meaning for that bar for anyone wondering.
gotta apprieciate the music and even though he lost to KSI he hasnt gone down in my oppinion but if he just trains harder and harder he can beat anyone this goes for everyone tbh
Swarmz vs kristen hanby is officially now what
5 days and is still no.1 trending in music
Swarmz was hella irrelevant before KSI, now after the fight he’s relevant again
Stick to rapping bro your good at it , no more boxing 👊🏻
This goes WAY too hard for it's own good
The GOAT Swarmz is back in the ring 🔥
Plz guys go and listen mash-up once plz😥🙏https://youtube.com/channel/UCRlLVR4wINY9Eipr1P7ZE3A subscribe if u like

I respect Swarmz for accepting the lost and just moving on with his music career

Actually pretty good
Lmfao shut up swarmz
Yet another example of making stupid people famous
How's he talking about sparking people when he is a fucking pussy who got battered by a YouTuber ffs
W rizz song, but someone post the sleepover pic again
Swarmz should definitely be a full time artist
🔥
SWARMZ VS PINEDA 🔥
Swarmz - TKO [Remix Music Video] the Eminem version is better than this one i agree
Swarmz - TKO [Remix Music Video] the Eminem remix is way better than this 100%
Swarmz - TKO [Remix Music Video] the Eminem remix is way better than this
Swarmz v bryce hall 😺 maybe?
Brooo this song is coldddd
That Austin bar is jokes
disliked for being nigerian
Tune 🔥💯
Is it just me or he took alot of inspiration from Doja by Central Cee for this song
.
This is fire Simon is biased af.
Ur a jk man get ksi then send shot  to other lool jk man
Don't be sendin for man when you can't punch even ksi up. Wet yutr
It's mad how people can't see how good a musical artist Swarmz is, I'm a KSI fan and there's no way KSI ever beats this man in a disstrack
The cheek after getting dusted by Ksi this shouldn’t be aloud
Sounds very generic and too similar to his last one
Just stick to music man 😭😭
Nobody in boxing….  But can destroy any youtuber in disstrack scene
Improvent from the KSI Diss Track. This one is fire.  🔥🔥🔥 Respect, playing the game perfectly....
dammmm ok
I saw them film this
Tch. You lost bro and was running around😂
Wonder what ksi thinks of this ngl
might not box well yet but you do make hits ngl this was fire
you lost 😂
das fire
I really hope he does more fights just so we can keep getting bangers like this and the KSI diss
Bars 100%  Flow insane  Fighting skill.... fUcK aLl SkiLl
Sounds crazy when he says "Wobble like bambi"
Brooo you gotta fight W2S fr
Demon time swarmz

Jesus Christ this is wow 🔥

Here before 1mil
Swarms should fight Pineda, would be jokes. Give Pineda another loss 🤣, he ain’t no professional
MADMAN MADMAN MADMAN
"Half Bajan, but i rep Jamaica." Favorite line
Just gonna say, Swarmz is way better at music than JJ
Good track but bars talking about giving left and rights and talking tough don’t make sense after what we’ve seen 😂
I can’t understand what this guy is saying
beat lowkey carries
I’m not even a swarmz supporter but this hits hard🥶
Put us in the ring ima show man pressure 🤣 pure lies
He goes hard
Untouchable flow 🗣✅
Didn’t think I was gonna like this but it’s dope af
corn's gonna fly? what? u tryna shoot someone?
respect but cant be saying “catch us in the ring Imma show him my pressure” about joe weller… sorry swarmz but just rap fam
Cant lie bro is playing mw 😹
the song is mad but his boxing career is an L
Brudda rlly got the Thomas the tank engine ball over the subtitles love that haha
GET THIS FUCKING MAN UPPPP <3
Swarms might aswelll stick to da music no cap
👑

This low key fire
Literally got owned and showed no skills at all and now he's just milking his moment in the spotlight making a song about that boxing event lol
Deji would him eat him don't disrespect him 😤
Can't wait for the day when we see 20v1 swarmz edition

Swarmz is here for the vibes and I’m here for it lol
Man had one of the biggest comebacks in the game 🔥
You should fight austin mcmatura next

Naah i love this guy 😂
This would make more sense if you actually beat KSI
Sounds like lethal b flow
austin macbroom
Swarmz is sick with the music man i wanna see him back in the ring 100% more improved
When you give the mic to someone that can actually rap:
where was the pressure against ksi though
Who dis guy 🔥🔥🔥
Dem bars tho! 🔥🔥🔥
Swarmz big up yourself!  ❤️
Stick to rapping fam 💯🔥 leave that boxing shit
i actually hope you stick to camp an jump back in the ring. honestly i had never heard of you before the ksi fight you brought the smoke in promo and smashed it i rate your music too use this time you got in fame from the fight to spread your talent brother hype up cant wait for more from you
Straight up ire someone needs to tag @Keemstar or @Scarce
Cant lie man is hard spun the track, just like in the ring
shiet I thought I was playing MW
man is spitting FAYAAA
hows your melon g
Why this lowkey hard
i respect the grind 🤣
someone already said it but if his boxing ability was the same as his rapping ability jj would be so done for idc what anyone say you can argue idc its facts
bop
The real madman
The flow was so immaculate. Goodness fucking gracious.
I love everything Swarmz is doing, I  just hope he's actually training so when the next opportunity comes he can actually compete in the ring.
pipe down, Deji is not on your radar.
nonces last longer w kids than u do in the ring..
swarmz u dont wanna fight deji you dont wanna be 0-2...
The line: "Dont play games brudda this aint jumanji". 💯🔥
He got my respect
Wait... I swear Swarmz just got knocked out by KSI, I’m just glad he’s conscious now 🤣
swarmz songs recently have been so fuking fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yesssir 🤣
Another drill rapper rapping bout shit they never did 😬🤦🏾‍♂️
yoooooo❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
He made a song of him getting TKO 😂😂😂
Lost to KSI
🔥
You did well against jj but don’t mess with deji he will clap u
Swarmz is such an underrated rapper ahlie 😎😎
Lfgg
"Don't play games nah this ain't the saga"  ..."saga"....don't you mean "sega"? lol
This is fire
Half bajan but i rep jamaica being a bajan here myself i respect that part a lot
this slaps
Kristen Hanby actually responded to this with a Swarmz disstrack but the funny thing is hardly anyone knows about it. He only gained 30k views in 2 days and the guy has over 3mil subs
bro this is fire
bruh the beat is maddd bruh
deji would mash you up.
Feel like this is the second friend ksi will make after that fight
Dam swarmz
big respect
Swarmz Vs Logan when?
this is an amazing song but the atmosphere did not match the lyrics
Technical knockout for the good mind is spiritual thinking.
Stop u like bambi on ice
Gg
Can't wait for his transformation after 6 month and This song yeah is Mad itself, its a Banger fam you get yeah. 🥶🔥💯
Now this guy can rap
https://youtu.be/Me0U9F8GR-A
Despite not getting Alex Wassabi vs KSI, I feel like YouTube boxing as a whole benefits a lot more by having Swarmz included in it. He brings hype and energy that others simply can’t. So in a way, we actually came up from Wassabi pulling out.
let me grab that KSI for you my man, i KO them first round. i fight K1 for 16 years, 117,6 KG leggo
I don't understand how I never liked rap besides 1 Eminem and 1 50 cent song yet KSI and this guy's actually sound catchy.
Tbh i want to see him in the ring just so that we can him improve
Say what you want about Swarmz he makes bangers🔥🔥🔥🔥
He couldn't have took his L better than he is doing now
Can’t even hate on it. Chase that bag g
He found out that ksi fight will promote his music..genius
my respect for swarmz is fucking high as he used his loss as an advantage
Mad 🇯🇲
Fire flow but man after watching swarmz fight this entire song is pretty cringe
Fire 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶
Whose the old dude in blue, mf a king
The  future boogeyman of YouTube boxing in my opinion he gonna fight anyone win or lose
Im a jj fan but damn this actualy fire
Manz went ham on dis song
this is actually sick
ngl this kinda fire where was this guy when I ran outa song on my playlist 💀
This actually exists?
W8...this man is a bajan?
Calling out jake or logam u couldn't beat pinada u was spinning like a bayblade
Get back into training brothaaaaa
#1 trending for music, swarmz finally gets the recognition he should’ve got from the start!💯
He turned his L into a W with this u gotta respect swarmz for it
OK OK let's be real..man's fire with the music but unless he's really gonna try to catch up and put in the work he's not gonna be a good boxer..he's big enough to do so..long reach but does he want it....
Ok
Way better rapper than he is boxer🤣🤣song slaps tho no disrespect 🔥🔥🙌
Still lost
Bryce Hall would be an interesting match up
Under rated
0.53 best momentum ever
Hes trying to die r.i.p swarmz die at 2022 by ksi big head bunch

bozo still thinking he's the shit💀💀
This shitis good
Hei, toivottavasti pärjäät hyvin. Teen musiikkia, mutta on todella vaikeaa olla näkyvissä, kun sinua ei tunneta, mutta teen parhaani saadakseni taiteen tunnetuksi. Kutsun sinut tutustumaan Beateihini ja jos et ole pettynyt, älä epäröi tilata ja jakaa ystävillesi ;)
This is not how you turn a L in to fire
this guy is like deji when he was shit talking everyone
Yoooo this is liit
My bro fell asleep listening to this shi 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Keep it up brother. If you take boxing seriously and properly train I believe you could do well. Good shit my guy. Turning an L to hopeful W.
Yo man’s got heat, okay swarmz🔥

COLLLDDDDDDDDDD
damnn hs
🔥🔥🔥
Big up swarmz. Bonce back hard

Swarmz may not be great in the ring just yet but he can definitely generate hype very well with his musical talents.
Boxing Swarmz may be a meme but when it comes to music he never fails to deliver 🔥
Even though this guy got destroyed, he's still spitting good lyrics, sorry ksi
Damn this shi goes crazy
Swarmz with a swarm of viewers
fight andrew twat🤧😎😎
1 on trending jhezee
Ι like how he's able to talk smack and also make fun of himself. He got dropped but he's right back up talking that shit again😂. You gotta love this guy.
Did he just switch his career from a rapper/singer to influencer ? 😂

Swarmz would get smoked by all the fighters he called out. He’s nothing but a scary ass fighter
POP SMOKE 🥵
This is acctually cold
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Swarmz with the Austin prediction
No.1 music my goat swarmz
Mans smart
When you need subtitles....

Man came up with a brilliant idea to promote his music on his next fight 👏 🙌 👌
Bro is smart with it lmao
YOOOO THIS SHIT FIRE
Man swarmz music is really dope keep going sir
jj gotta stop sleeping on the quality of these tracks
mad
Love swarmz man he’s actually so sound
The best uk
Lit🔥

Duh bloot blur skidity pop ping

Big up swarmz respect what he’s doing can’t lie
Faaaaaaaaaammm it lit
Austin he got knocked out twice
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Like the flow 🔥
Wow
In all my life of boxing experience i have never seen any one quite like swarmz. His drive, his relentlessness is just unparalleled. Am i saying that he is the best boxer of all time? No. But do i belive that given the opportunity swarmz could ko muhammed ali in his prime. Yes
Good song. Deji would smoke you tho frfr!
next even we supporting you swarmz 💯
1:15 I heard this phrase differently
Did he leave anyone? 🤣
Bro dissed everyone after getting clapped 💀
swarms did better in the ring than pineda overall. With 2 weeks experience he did much better than I thought, he needs to get back into the ring with more training
Cold 🥶
he's really a spinning mad man
MADMAN
You smashed it brother , big up!
Smart man
Wish he went this hard in the ring come on
The definition of got knocked out and came back

Nahhh man spazzed out on this still 👊🔥🔥
if he can back up the trash talking with boxing, honestly might be one of the best boxing "celebrities" rn
Swarmz is the 🐐
This really shows the levels between YouTube rappers and actual rappers. Mans flow and bars are so on point and this is fucking good yuno

*radar
This is actually hanging. I have major respect for u from bouncing back after that loss. Train hard and fight easy 🤷‍♂️ fight Joe, but train a lot more and for longer. Ksi was due to lack of training comparison to him. (This is from a KSI fan)
bro this is why he should just stick to music man he has so much talent in music not fighting
An L is never an L if you let it be an L.
Bro, you better get em. Im rooting for you now.
Hard ngl
He may be good at music but please for the UK don't enter the ring and embarrassing yourself just stick to music
KSI has done this guy a massive favour

Can’t lie. This actually 🔥 my boy really made that L a Lesson and not a loss. taking big advantage of the situation and making bigger and better moves. Respect 💯
Some people have “it.” An aspect that makes you want to see them succeed, and this is what brings loyal consistent fans. Swarmz has “it.”
A lot of respect for a guy like swarmz that can take his opportunity then pounce on it even in defeat
Swarmz is going in can't lie
This man 🤣🤣
This it fire bro 😭😭😭
Fire song ong
BETTER CALL SWARMZ
Still chatting shit after getting slapped! 🤌🏻
This is so gassss
Swarmz is on fire bruv this good
Let’s just find words that rhyme and call it rap.
Uk rap sounds horrible compared to the US. No skills.. well I guess you could say the US mainstream rappers have no skill either. Real skill is all underground now
Swarmz is a joker. He ain't gonna beat Nobody in boxing 😭🙄
Cant lie this is a bop
bro when he got rocked thats when he gets drunk and posts some shit like this
The last 2 tracks have been some of his best lyrical work
Man like kenny
Great banterrr you know
He’s a MAD MAN
Life is a game and he's got a pretty good idea how to play. GG
WWWWWWW THIS IS 🔥
Always remember today that God loves you, so no matter what your going through you have someone to lean on. he loves you so much he sent his only son to die for you pls don’t forget this, I love you God bless ❤️

This guy used this opportunity well
What a BELL END.
Swarmz lost the fight but like he become the peoples champion 👑👑
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
THIS DUDE SHOULD NOT BE CALLING ANYONE OUT.........😆
Swarmz is the best thing to happen to youtube boxing 😭
im gonna be honest he may have gotten rocked in the fight but he is making sure he can make his back off of it and  i have mad respect for him for doin it well
Not too bad. But need to make a storyline. It's good catchy. It may not be memorable. It will become a hit wonder. I'm not going to bring  hate. It may not related to all of us. You want to turn your rap into press release. You needed to go back on the drawings board
How is man still tryna act like he didn't just get embarrassed.
This man saw the money and didn’t look back
Fight joe weller. #teamswarmz
This is a man who gets it - get that bread fella, would be dope to see you whoop Joe Weller on a future card.
He would get knocked out by a 16 yr old 🤣🤣
This guy understands how the game is played. GG. Banger.
fire
This is kinda hard to be honest , no idea who he was before the KSI fight but I think I’m a fan now
Nice
Man said swamz is that bored now 🤣
Why are you doing music idiot
bro is mad smart
This guy is running from 13 years olds puff 😂
This a Dub

افضل الصلاة والسلام على النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم صلى

Fight me bro we at the same level you need to work your way up to the names you droppin in these songs, we seen you fight already fam that nigga KSI had you doing pirouettes 🤣🤣🤣 you mines well let me be the next one to fight you on one of them cards 💯😩👹

Swarmz vs Pineda needs to happen now.

mad respect to swarms tho he took his loss like a man and instead of being sad or going down hill he still managed to make something out it
Swarms songs are  a banger

This is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥 god daym
Dude just stop, you aren’t a boxer. He just got a bag and now he’s calling out more people so he can try and get more money. Just stupid & Pathetic
Bro just stop, you can’t beat anyone
This is a representation of acting strong when you’re weak and the fact Swarmz is killin it in the industry is wassup‼️‼️

Swarmz makes go music
I actually Gained alot of respect for him for what he's done lately. And regardless of the memes about him boxing, with a few months training and an opponent that makes sense for him,  he could be decent. Everyone deserves a second chance Right?
joe weller should learn from both logan and swarmz on how to bounce back after a loss
Mad man 🔥
bro thinks he won 30 fights and calls out everyone who would beat his ass
Swarmz is nice with it
This is class
holy man went in 😭😂
He lost shouldn't he be the worst rapper and delete his social media
Still needs a plan b.c.d.e.f.g because your shit
Bro posted this video TKO when he got knocked down by ksi. And now he's going after logan and jake. Who are you?
A rapper that was beaten by a youtuber

Might add 100 views on this 😮‍💨
cold song
He’s got no right to make this song, he got bitch slapped for a couple minutes and for some reason he thinks he’s got the credentials for this 😂
MADMAN
💥🔥🔥❄
This a banger mad man🔥💪🐐
tyler smith said your a pussy and he would headbutt you   Love from T1drizzy
The old guy with the dodgy eye is a sex offender btw
This fire🔥
Especially when it's a tune about youtube boxing😂😂
Should've just titled it "youtube boxers who would beat me". Man got bullied by KSI, Logan towers him, Deji would just absolutely put him a kip so just stick to rapping your better at that G. P.S why you even mentioning 4.4s and gripping leather while making a tune called "TKO" pussy nerd 😂😂
I'm a fan
Overrated
Lol he’s begging it 😂 bro you got fucked up by a YouTuber. Take it like a champ and move on smh
Well he’s a one hit wonder now he’s sending for YouTubers after his loss it’s actually embarrassing
Bro rapping like he won 😂
🔥
Imagine this for a card....  1. Ksi vs winner of Gib Austin Mcbroom  2. Jake Paul vs Anderson Silva 3. Logan Paul vs Dillon Danis 4. Andrew Tate vs Vidal Riley 5. Tristan Tate vs Hassim Jr. 6. Deji vs Joe Weller 7. Swarmz vs Alex Wassabi  8. King Kenny vs Slim  Or  1. Ksi vs winner of Gib Austin Mcbroom  2. Jake Paul vs Andrew Tate 3. Tristan Tate vs Anderson Silva 4. Logan Paul vs Dillon Danis 5. Deji vs Joe Weller 6. Swarmz vs Alex Wassabi 7. Hassim Jr. vs Vidal 8. King Kenny vs Slim
Shut up man
Flow was JUMPY, but the bars were RECYCLED nuh rass
The best rapper in youtube boxing title has been taken from ksi
it’s so funny how easily u can see the lyrical differences in a youtuber diss track vs a rappers diss track 😭💀
HARD 🔥🔥🔥
Icl his flows cold but boxings not rly for him
Slaps can’t lie
no effense tho bro austin is as bad as ksi u gon get whooped by that prick. i dont fw austin at all so
Swarms got TKO’d like a week ago, and now hes come out looking better than Joe Weller who lost YEARS AGO. Its mot what happens to you , its how you react. King shit. Life lessons before our eyes. Liked, subscribed
I find it funny he decided to add subs in this one
From Lyca to lyca  to this omdz embarrassing 🤦🏽‍♂️
Stfu swampz u cant even punch and u want to fight the pauls
This is a tune
Man's a clown talking like that,  hands barely good enough to bless himself 🙏
Ayo swarmz got to fight again..  This dude is really good promoter
British rap 101:  1) reference a footballer  2) say ‘no’ or ‘like’ by something vaguely linked and call it word play   Eg ‘Never got it off white like I’m Van Dijk’ ‘Got on my Jordans no no sancho’  I know his name is Jadon, not Jordan, hence the ‘no no’ hahah.   British rap, grime, drill whatever tf you wanna call it is always the same.   I’m not murican btw, before you get pissy. I’m European too, murican rap isn’t much better, I’d rather listen English rap but still. Always the same nonsense.
Idc this is so cold ong
✨
My Dawg. Back with a banger
ksi revived this guys lmao
i just want them to give him more than 2 weeks
Fight Pineda next plz

Swarmz took the L correctly and I respect him. He promoted the fight more than Pussyhole Pussabi would ever do and he’s now making banger music. I respect him alot, keep up the work Swarmz!
Ngl Swarmz > JJ when it comes to rap
THE BOXING GOAT WITH ANOTHER BANGER

swarmz is the best rapper alive
Actually kinda slapped man
Dang the day after the queen died rip 😢
Goated song love swarmz 🔥
I'm watching this in 480p on an old tablet and somehow this whole video still looks ultra 4K HD. Like, I actually had to check if YouTube auto switched to 1080 but the camera work and editing is just that good.
Swarmz is actually a mad rapper. The bars and flow is jus a 10/10. Fair play to him stepping into the ring thrusted his career so much. King here 👑
Road to 1m?
👑👑👑
Mandem went night night but called out everyone after that hahahaha, at least his music hits hard
🔥
Wherever the weather 🤣🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Yo swarms ya got beat, now your tryna rap your way out of the heat, ksi boxed man like true say he’s from the streets, you’ll probably run in the ring from the rest of these YouTube neeks, hard on beats but the gloves don’t suit you, how can you get smashed in from team YouTube, even weller would give u a fight, lucky ksi didn’t decide earlier to say good night
Simple flow nothing too impressive why are people gassing this like it’s cold 😂dead beat n all

But the prick's hopeless, must bе smoking meth Thought you had hovis but you must have less Who's that brеdda? joe weller Don't lemme go 'n grab for the leather Big .44, no safety sweater The kickback huge, come big like heather Two weeks straight man collected cheddar Punch man up like whatever the weather Joe wasn't talking when we was together Put us in the ring, i'ma show man pressure Jordan, harvey, forget wassabi I was in the party, tryna get narni Then i got a call from mams, ksi Kristen hanby, i ain't gonna lie Corns gonna fly, are you tryna die? Send him to the sky I ain't tryna hear replies Lemme give advice, if i pull up with the guys Me n' you ain't really size if i swing a hefty right Still got deji up on my radar Don't take man for idiot pineda Can everyone please do me a favour?

How can you be taken seriously after last week man 🥲
Not gonna lie. This shit is kinda hard. I really enjoyed listening to it. But isn't the beginning from Cold Room
Banger, but lets hope he returns to the ring with less 360's mans not no beyblade. hope you knock the lid of one of the names you mentioned in your next fight!
Zamn this was actually fire 🔥
Swarms will be the next KSI
He’s mixing platforms... cold still ur best shit ngl
Ratio + violation by your own supporter🖕🖕
Honestly that fight with ksi was the best thing to happen to swarmz it gave him a bigger stage to show off his music abilities
Shit is fire
“So how many people do you want to call out?”  Swarmz: “Yes.”
Yo this went hard no cap😵‍💫
Calling everyone out but did the worst in the boxing ring out of all the fights.
cant say nuthing bout swarmz rappin
say what you will about swarmz's performance in the ring, the fact that he got to the weight in the time provided AND actually got in the ring deserves mad props. i wanna see him fight with some more training, hell maybe a ksi rematch a couple years from now? 👀
This is what we call momentum
To the Editor : respect++ 🙌🏻
Deji’s next sacrificial lamb
Man was ballet dancing in the ring and he is talking about picking login or Jake to fight lmao they probably wouldn't give him the time of day
This tune is fire
NGL This kinda lit 🔥
R.I.P Queen
Damn this goes hard....
Big up swampz He a mad man Respect
I sincerely hope hes gonna back his words up tho. He better win his next fight. rooting For my g
Big up ⬆️
even Swarmz raps better than ksi
we've got to show some respect to swarmz for getting into the ring with only 2 weeks of training he did better than that Pineda mf and the way he's taking advantage of this entire situation is actually clever
fight queen elizabeth plz
u gotslapped up shush
it hit the whole youtube boxing committee
he went in wow
Song bangs🔥 but swarmz definitely not in a position to "pick" jake or logan lmao😂
His British accent so strong its making me question if it’s even English or nah

😂😂
Nah this man took this opportunity and RAN with it and I LOVE it😂😂😂😂  This might be the best Loss we've seen in yourube boxing 😂😂
decent
He's knows how to rap, but I don't think embarrassing himself for the bag and then calling others out for another quick loss and bag again, is a good look on pride and dignity lol
bro you cant lie bro raps WAYYYYY better then ksi we gotta be real love ksi tho
Ngl We should learn how to grab an opportunity from him.
🔥

Sounds similar to the beat he used in ksi diss track
Not bad at all swamz
yo swarmz got bars, i like his rap style he has good energy 💯
Man called out more people that JJ
The brudda needs to gospel rap after that warm up session for ksi
This guy is really smart. He is really using all limelight that been getting so far to his advantage
Wohhh this is 🔥
Man knows even if he lost he made money
So many white people
I don’t wana hear war talk, this guy soft AF
Swarmz is a champion man! Not like Swarmz was broke but he's has completely blown up, career looking good if he sticks to it! W Swarmz
Not a boxer but a true fighter
He looks rich now 😂😂😂
spotify  ? when
Bro goes in on everyone and everything
Swarmz 😂
CMON!!!
Dis guy just dissed everyone who can beat him in a boxin match just for clout
Use the publicity to grow your music career! Capitalize on this bro
great
w swarms idc
Swarmz know the YouTube is the way to the bag
I was skeptical when i saw the this when scrolling but it bangs and he got flows and bars. Can't lie, Swarmz is making the right moves and eating from this youtube boxing thing. Its getting serious now and hes now involved at the right time. I'd do the same. I like how real he keeps it. Big up Swarmz! New sub
Youtuber Swarmz
🔥
How this brudda calling everyone when he got knocked and looked shocking. Hope for his sake he never gets in the ring again 🤦😂
madman💪🏼🔥

This is fire for the YT boxing scene, brother!🔥🔥🔥
1:39 bro still thinks it’s 2016 Euros
HARD😮‍💨
Mad mon
Nah your taking advantage of this spotlight.... and I love it
See all these comments praising this tune. Am I only real Swarmz supporter who listens and reads these lyrics and just see's that he's begging for that paycheck again?? You aren't a youtuber lad, you are a musician - don't sell out for the check, please! End up like chip when he sold out for pop then came back, don't make the same mistakes lad.
Please train and beat someone
1:21 Bryce Hall after the fight you'll need a Bible nahhh 😂
This is fire I’m ngl
This goes hard ngl
Swarmz vs joe weller ?
Respect for putting himself out there after the ksi fight
Mate smarmz will get batted by all of them deji, Logan Paul, jake Paul
“2 week straight man collected cheddar” hustle and motivation
I’m a madman watch
this goes hard yo
banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you don’t step right you might get left
He got the personality & always been a good artist. KSI still out here birthing YouTube personalities, cause I can see Swarms doin this YT thing
Shit 🔥 ngl 😭
🔥
L -> W
U tried your best man keep the grind going
He gots raps but I wouldn’t get caught bumping this beat in public. 🤣 Doesn’t slap at all! Wack beat af
Bangers 🔥
This shit hard asf
AMAZING I RATE IT 👏
🤭🤣😂this is fcuking fire hahaha
What a beg
I don't think him losing to ksi was an L. it was a smart move he's capitalising from it
Lmao how can so many of you support delusion.
🔥
This is sick, you've taken it like a champ. Although I can't lie, I don't have much confidence that you could beat any of those guys in the ring... Prove me wrong 🙏
Ayooo, this was actually hard AF.
The way mans talking I nearly forgot he lost, mans flipping that L real quick
You simply can't hate this guy he is a living legend and I give him huge respect
KSI Reddit do your ting
.
This guy is a marketing genius 👏🏿
Sick 🔥🇬🇧
Lad you’d get smoked by Ronald McDonald
this man rapping like he didnt get the biggest ass whooping of his career XD
Respect to swarmz 🔥🔥
ur milking it now bro jus leave it alone
When KSI puts the spotlight on you, you are bound to succeed in life. Prime example.
This is so fire man. Gotta love the way he handled all of this. Big up g ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
If bro stays consistent he's gonna do well
BIG W

MADMAN

Bro turned a massive L into a massive W
Mad man needs to finish business with Piñeda first to warm up!
WWWW
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are you calling out Jake and Logan 🤣
Wow, this professional boxer can rap. He should start a career in music.
Smh how can he rap talkin hard after his last fight
Misfits should take him under every ksi card, he got marketing skills bro🔥
I don’t know if you have a chance vs any of the people you named
Swarmz wants all the smoke 😂😂😂
i just hope he fights again with some actual time to train he deserves a chance he could do well
This is actually a certified banger
Going in but still no all thoes names and none of them you could actually beat but good song.
Bruv splitting can't lie 🔥🔥🔥
MADMAN
This was actully good 😂
Cool song but 95% of the people he called out would slap him around the ring 😆 my guy has let the fact he managed to run for 2 rounds gass him up too much lol.
Nah swarmz too cold with it this is where he excels you man let the beast out to play trust 💯
💯
Madman . Big up Swarmz
Capitalising
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He got punched up but can clearly rap better than KSI
Rahhh this is too hard are you mad!!!🔥🔥🔥
Swarmz vs Deji Would Be An Good Fight Ill Pay To Watch That FORREAL
AY AY
W for Swarmz trying to capitalize off the boxing fight hopefully we see him in the ring again
Damn this is 🔥
swarmz is a MADMAN
Swarmz is actually hard to hate icl😅
Low-key wanna see Swarmz get better at fighting and go from being the guy no one knew to being THAT GUY in YouTube boxing and shit
Swarmz go hard yk! 👌

W
KSI in the ring, Swarmz on the tracks, nuff said
Swarmz got them money moves in mind
Give him a few months and he might be a not bad boxer surley can't be worse than pineda that's for sure
Fair play
Wonder who he’s gonna fight next.
Swarmz bringing back that YouTube diss track era and I’m here for it he’s killing the YouTube scene rn
all i understood as an american was joe weller
Bro seriously u can’t fight👍
Bro really turning his losses into earnings
Omg W
This was fcking firee 🔥🔥🔥
Banger🔥
in the end I'm glad we got Swarmz over Alex Wassabi, this guy definitely deserves the attention more
He didn’t have this energy in the ring tho
Swarmz shoulda defo hop in the ring again
What a g. Come on my guy 🔥
Bro really chasing the bag, respect.
Worst part is he will run around the ring for all those fights… 😭
you got tko ed but this is still fire🔥

SWARMZ TAKEOVERRRRRR
Lol there were a lot of misspelled words in the lyrics, but meh, nobody reads those anyway! This is 🔥. The Madman taking full advantage of the attention!
your performance in the ring was appalling, you shouldn't be shouting out anyone to fight because even the worst opponent would sleep u
👌
dam
Dude got KOd
0:54 lol wassbi
Man nailed it
Fight jidion
Homie thinks he can even get on a card with Logan or Jake 💀💀💀💀
uk music is so shit
Swarmz who tf did your subtitles they need sacking
Journey men these Days lol
The song is good but I don’t think he can take on some of the guys he mentioned and deji already outclasses him tenfold
