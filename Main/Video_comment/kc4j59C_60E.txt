THE WHOLE THING WAS PHOTOSHOPPED WITH THE FENCE BEING MOVED 8 FT YOU SAW THAT PICTURE RIGHT
Someday nature will provide cali with what they want. The state will slide off into the ocean. So they can be the independent country they want. We can then wall off the coast. And they can have all the crimals they want.
"Earth, a 4.5 billion year old planet".....now there is ZERO evidence of that, in fact the actual evidence shows a very younf earth, but we'll still keep telling this lie.
When they started talking about The Big One that's supposed to hit SoCal, I was reminded of the movie Earthquake (1974?) starring Charlton Heston.
This morning I experienced my very first California Earthquake Tremor. My apartment shook and trembled but nothing fell over. It lasted just under a minute. There was an Earthquake on The opposite side of The Golden Gate Bridge. Near Oakland.
this is extremely fascinating and shocking at the same time, i really hope anyone who lives in California or mostly in the west stay cautious / aware about this.
I started doing research about 1979. I then looked at history. The quake that destroyed the San Mateo mission, the quake of October 1865, then the quake of 1866 and October of 1868. Now my research came together I predicted the October 1989, then the June 1990 quake. I turned my research over to the USGS in Menlo Park. The quake of October 1992 never happened, it would have been big.
5:18 - 5:20  I'm not buying that photograph.  The only change is the location of 20 feet of fence.  I Call B.S.
Background music too loud and annoying.......
Irrelevant informercials during this video ANNOYING
I'll just wait until Earth plate tectonics make a new giant continent again. It'll probably be called U.S. if there are still oil deposits in a few billion years.
3:10 + there were not 28,000 buildings in 1906!!! 😂
WRONG! Northridge was at the very least a 7
Its said that when the big one does strike. LA will be where SF is
I was 12 when the Northridge earthquake happened in 1994, definitely an experience that made me wary of the fault lines I used to live on (moved to Texas). Hopefully my kids won’t experience an earthquake ever in their lives, and never again for myself of course. Lol
this is such an informative video and you've done a great job presenting the facts about the San Andreas Fault. however, i can't help but feel like the emphasis on impending disaster might create unnecessary fear. while it's important to be aware, shouldn’t we also focus on preparedness and resilience instead of just the doom and gloom?
I lived on that fault line for 18 yrs and trust me there was no false realities.
i really enjoyed this video; the way you explained the San Andreas Fault was super insightful! but i can't help but wonder if we might be overreacting to the potential disaster. i mean, isn’t it possible that history shows us these big earthquakes are less predictable than we think? just a thought!
1987 whitter narrows was my worst experience one...

New Madrid fault from 1811 too 1812
13:52 I want that lizard.
And here I am, smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in Hawaii waiting to get Tsnami’d. I’ll get my surf board ready……. 🤙🏾
Hmm and this is four years old.
These idiots NEVER learn. It did NOT go on for 100 million years. These “ scientists” are fools
Here We areb2025 And I'm not just talking San Andrea Hydren Falt Lines Totonic Plattes are moving Lower 48th and Alaska  Worldwide Earthquakes App imagine that Professional Volconagist and Geolgest registered USGS okay 🤠⚒️⛏️🖖👍🇺🇸🌎
They have been saying the big one is coming since the 1970's. Thats 50 years now and some say they've been saying that the big one is coming for 60 years now. I'm still waiting here. Where is it? This video was created 4 years ago. No one knows when it will happen. It could take another 100 years or more honestly. This just seems like fear mongering to me.
With the latest preparedness issues with the Palisades and Eaton fires, we are nowhere near ready for the impending big one.  Expect much higher statistics.
2025 here 😂
What 😮😦😦😦😦😦😮😮😮😮😦😦😦😦😮😮😮
I only say this because if one looks at something in a different prospective of things of how the earth is built on water rocks sand from volcanic of volcano eruption to make a difference in island Islands being after long time it has too have tender spots even having a hard layer but anything built has a tender spot to hurt
I could also sworn the channels are connected to underground volcano which trigger the volcano activity speaking out of just learning and reading applying all one learns on everything on life
Just thought
Probably you softener the shell
If earth was an egg and you hitting that eggs what happs?
The Earth was made by God
Nice, slick production for the layperson that would like an introduction to earthquakes.
My neighbors son just graduated as a geologist this year, he is 48.
“About to strike” could be 1,000 years from now😂
December 2024, Still waiting.
❤❤❤❤
Is December 2024 the moment we've waited for🤔
When will the San Andreas move? Whenever it wants.
We just need to be right with our creator and whatever has to come...would be God's willing 🙏
21:00 somebody thinks its probably god
8:33 guy sounds like a cartoon character. Like the mayor from power puff girls
This originally aired in 2009
I moved out of California fearing another earth quake could happen at any moment that was 3 years ago i visit sometimes but don't plan on living there again.
We better call the Rock
I did it
That picture of the fence is so offensively fake!  Nothing else moved!  🤔
I just think it’s crazy that……oh nevermind
Narrator is overselling it.
The point that most people fail to understand is that in geologic time, our current lifetimes, in years, is like a grain of sand on all the beaches in all the world. Insignificant.  For 10 years, my wife and I taught the F.E.M.A./C.E.R.T. curriculum for "disaster preparedness". It will surprise no one that most of the citizens in areas like San Diego haven't a nodding acquaintance about just how deadly this next "big one" will be.    Andrea Donnellen is a geophysicist with JPL/NASA. She has a most startling hypothesis about how the Southern California area will respond to a 7.8 'quake in the Salton Sea area.   Check this out...  "The Southern California San Andreas Fault ruptures about every 130 to 350 years, on average. We are looong overdue. The southern part of the San Andreas has the potential of moving the Salton Seas' easterly coastline 20' to the southeast, when the next rupture occurs on the fault."
The earthquake of 1680 was worse! About 344 years ago!
So with-in 30 years and it can’t be a couple years late like it happened to the lil earthquake town 😮
wow
Maybe it'll happen in 2025 humble humans
Superman movie..Vegas will have water front property
3 years later...still here
You know you keep talking about Southern California... What about Central and Northern California??? You know the fault line does go all the way up the coast and meets with the Wanda fuca fracture zone... And when the Wanda fuca goes it will affect the San Andreas fault... Contrary to popular belief that puts the whole entire State at risk not just LA... No it will not be like we see in the movies but there will be lots of damage... And they're saying everything this side of {I}5 will be toast 9.0 and Sonoma county could see at least an 8.0 or have you forgotten about the 89 quake and how much damage it caused and not just that but how far it was felt USGS first registered it as a 7.2 and was downgraded from a 7.2 to a 6.9 does anybody remember that???
Earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes fire. Pick your disaster. I am as prepared as I can be.
All we can do is be as prepared as possible. I have big furniture tied to walls, magnets on cabinets, extra water. Not much else you can do but be prepared
There's really nothing new here. I studied plate tectonics in university 50 years ago and they were talking of the big one coming to the San Andreas fault. They're still saying the same thing.🤔When it finally happens, no one should be surprised.
Felt the San Simeon quake Scarey my when you sleep during daytime
the San Andreas near San Francisco has already unleashed an 8.0, its been a long time apparently the sourhern end near Los Angeles has experienced a San Andreas megaquake
Zesty as heck keep preaching panic and chaos
An FYI for my fellow New Yorkers. There's a fault line running up the Hudson River. It's where the Atlantic Plate runs up against the North American Plate. Yes. It hasn't  really shifted much since the tremors felt in the mid-1980's. BUT, make no mistake. It has the potential of "coming to life" and, causing major damage to New York City and, the surrounding areas! Mind you. Those buildings AREN'T BUILT TO EARTHQUAKE STANDARDS! Simply because nobody has ever thought about an earthquake along that fault line.  Now, I want those who are more knowledgeable than me to correct me, if I'm wrong. I suspect that a magnitude 5.0 or, a bit greater earthquake would level most, if not, all the buildings in Manhattan! Severing countless underground water pipes, etc., causing havoc never before seen in New York City. God help us WHEN it occurs!
It's not a question of "if", so much as "when" the San Andreas will come to life. My hopes and, prayers are that it doesn't. Yet, I know, all too well, that it's a fool's proposal. God help us!
15:12  LIZARD
8/6/24 I'm in Idaho and we are being inundated w California people moving here!  IDAHO is on San Andres toooo
No, I can't watch this! It will just be another one of those episodes they made without doing much (if any) research to make sure they have the story strait, like the one on the Yellowstone Supervolcano. That episode turned me off of How The Earth Was Made so much that instead of donating all the DVDs I bought to to the local library, I used them for Skeet Targets. PULL!
Anything from the "HISTORY" site is bull cookies.
3 years & waiting.
We had a proportionately small earthquake out here in the plains of Texas two years ago that was strong enough to shake my bed on the third floor of my dorm and wake me up from a nap. It was pure panic and chaos around campus in the public areas. We DONT GET EARTHQUAKES. At least not ones that we can actually notice. I can’t imagine living somewhere that earthquakes are a constant threat.
the homeless will float out to sea hahahagahahagaha  thats the democrat way
I lived in Hollister and it did have earthquakes.   It was known as the earthquake center not parkfield.  Where do you get your information? Store windows were broken.  No buildings fell but it didn’t have tall buildings.
I was brought up in Southern California so I’ve been through lots of quakes.  Because of that I’ve always rented my apartment on the top floor.  Then I won’t have the entire bldg fall on me.  Paranoid all these years later
I’m so glad I don’t own a $1.5 million dollar 3 bedroom house in California.
Geologic history of the San Andreas fault is oversimplified, thus not correct. The fault was created by subduction of the spreading ridge between the Farallon Plate and the Pacific Plate. The Farallon Plate subducted beneath the North American Plate, but the Pacific Plate moved differently. Really interesting stuff to Google if you want to understand how the western US formed. Plate tectonics is very cool!
Gonna calaps into the ocean one day, and I don't want to be here.
2000 deaths??? That's it????
all guessing and estimating when it comes to the dates and times. how can you say it took millions of years to move 300 feet? you say it moves 1 inch per year. that just prove to me these scientists are so stupid and try to fool everyone. first of all. the movement is not constant, the quakes are not constant, the strength of the quakes are not constant. none of the activity is constant. so how can you put a time frame on how long it took to move a certain distance? how would you know if it moved 10 feet in 1 year 3 thousand years ago? and then the next year it didnt move at all? you cant use current movement to estimate  past movement and then to add dates. how do you fit millions of years in a 6 thousand year planet? scientist dont believe in god and will find every way to exclude god from their equation. plus they never say they dont know. instead they make up all sorts of things that sounds possible. answer 1 question. why is it that god and nature is always proving them wrong?  scientists are always talking bs but they make it sounds convincing.
Aye, the awe inspiring San Andreas. She's locked, cocked and ready to rock! 2024.
Ayyy 2024
I believe much of what science has discovered; however, I sincerely wish our scientific community would refrain from such prideful huberous as to speak as if they were present at those points in history when events occurred.
That explains why they’re all moving here to Texas..😒
I lived on the San Andreas fault for 20 years in San Mateo, Burlingame & SF. It seemed like every time a quake hit, I was in a bathroom or a bar. It was spooky to hear & see the bottles at the bar jingle. To this day, I can't handle having glasses touch in a cabinet. Some funny stories over those years. I was in a tall building on land fill in Foster City in 1989. It was a test building on "rollers" apparently to maybe absorb the shock. Well to the engineers I can say it rocked, rolled & bounced. I never had a quake knock me to the floor like that one did.
I remember as a kid watching the water in our pool at our home in Hollywood go back and forth shooting up 5 or 6 feet in the air at the shallow end. Living in Southern California earthquakes happen a lot so no big deal however the big one is something different maybe that’s why I have my home here on the beach in Costa Rica.🌴😎🌴
History is Amazing!
i get the shakes when i think about it, and when girls wit big jugs pass me i dunno
Background music isn't really in the background.
17:30 creek jogged, but only 300 feet in 100 million years?  Nonsense.  The picket fence moved 8 feet in 1906.  19:00 the movement averaging X inches per year is also nonsense; it moves in spurts, not gradually.  The plate edges stay locked, for Z years or centuries, then break loose.  Hollister shows what the movement TRIES to be.  In other places it fails to move gradually because of shear that can't happen due to the cross-fault grabbing between one side and the other, some of it certainly because of the shapes of the rock interface across the fault line.  The HOLD, but can only hold so much, before failing and slipping/shearing.  The testing at the last part was very good work being done.  Materials science dictates that they test this in the lab, to get info about how much, how far, how strong, etc.  If such data is gotten, then predictions can be improved by magnitudes.
The actual experience and feeling of an earthquake, while occurring in 'real time,' are both magnificent and terrifying.  The powerful rocking plus vibrating of Planet Earth beneath by body feels like a rollercoaster ride.  Albeit, the slight fear and terror of:😿"This Is It; we may not survive through this one!!!!!"😭  I've felt both in San Francisco and Hawaii, indeed, Yikes❗❕🥺😳
Any scientists  out there?
Is there any correlation or path between San Andres fault and Yosemite volcano? I.e. is there a chance of Yosemite going off due to earthquake?
I have always wondered about the quakes being on some sort of a schedule, and all seem to be late. I'm thinking if all the drilling and sucking oil from the earth is causing it to kind of lock up somehow. Kind of like an engine. You run an engine with oil and drain it out while the engine is running, that engine will soon lock up and stop. If this is true about the earth, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near where the earth breaks loose again...
.. Peace.. Shalom.. Salam.. Namaste 🙏🏻 😊 🌈 ✌ ☮ ❤
I grew up in Thousand Oaks, CA in the 80’s and 90’s and went through the 6.7-6.9 Northridge earthquake. I was sound asleep but the ground motion was so intense that I was standing when I woke up. That was the only time that I remember seeing fear in my dad’s eyes. We ended up pulling cars out to the driveway and using the radio for info . No smartphones back then, haha.
This is good to know,thank you.
I hit a 5.0 after eating at Taco Bell😂
Was watching this last night, then there was an earthquake today  😅

4.2 just happened in San Bernardino  Came here to see the fault!
I originally thought that the Ridgecrest earthquakes in summer of 2019 was the ‘big one’ until I realized that we’d suffer too. Boy if this does happen, God will punish the San Andreas.
IS A GOD FAULT HE FORGETS TO STUDY 📖 ARCHITECTURE.🌏🌍🌎BEFORE MAKING THIS FRAGILE WORLD.
Heard the San Andreas fault will break this year 😮
Im Triangle angel of God..there is a earthquake in the making off the coast of California..stay away from the coast lines off the coast of California..tsunami warning
This video is full of incorrect information and guesses. Don't waste your time or brain cells.
When the Big One happens Nevada will be wine country
The Big One will happen. It is only a matter of time
Between the unnecessarily dramatic music and the narrator who can’t pronounce Marin County correctly, I gave up about 5 minutes into this video.
Carl Johnson
I was 18 years old when I left Los Angeles in 1994 just missed the Northridge earthquake by 3 months but the Indio/Coachella Valley still had a BIG earthquake…….
All that research.  Result is Los Angeles will have a major earthquake in the next 30 years.
Millions of California's citizens live in constant peril - really? Geologist's are warning of a potential disaster - are they warning people to move out of California?  Doubtful.  300 scientists conducting a special study of what a major earthquake would do.  Everybody already knows what it would do.  300 scientists?? Don't they have better things to do.  They can't stop a future earthquake, so why do they  waste their time studying it?  This should be interesting.
I'm from Pennsylvania and was stationed at the presidio in San Francisco for two years in the early 80s. We had small earthquakes all the time and they freaked me out for about a year until I got used to them.
Bye bye LA...SF on the order end😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🙄🙄
The San Andreas is re-tracking itself.  I predict the next big one centers somewhere on a line from Victorville to Temecula. Somewhere in there.  It's gonna be big.
Talking about "the big one", many other states are hoping it is big enough for CA to fall off into the ocean.
Isn't there anything that can be done to relieve the pressure ?       They have the holes that they drilled.   What about throwing some of that talcum powder down there so the stress doesn't buildup so much and it can move along more without stress.         There has got to be certain spots where the pressure builds up. help mother nature get to where it wants to go more easily.
Ive Read the book🫣
20 mil years ago 😂 The earth is flat😊
This episode premiered in Feb 2009, so we are almost 1/2 way through the 30 year prediction. I pray we hit the 1% of no quake or it ends up smaller but you never know.
Im waiting patiently for Sacramento to become beachfront property
😂😂😂
they should find the sources of those frequency waves, and put a stop to whatever is causing the vibrations. it would save milllions of lives, and billions of dollars. real estate and land prices would go down, because of the lower cost of engineering and lower risk of life and therefore a lower cost of living. something somewhere has to be causing such great vibrations to vibrate the earth to vibrate is such a violent way, if the source could be found and contrasting frequency waves used to dampen them or stop them, it would make life much safer in that area of America. of course, whatever is at fault probably has so much protection built into peoples minds and mythologies, that it would be next to impossible to get to it. makes me think of some oriental and indian, egyptian mythology that they have temples and areas that control the waters, and matter of the earth, sad that kind of unpeaceful control is allowed and not investigated.
Reading the comments here reminded me of a kind of surreal moment I had one day, in the high desert canyons, on the very North edge of the Grand Canyon. (or, just North of what used to be the Grand Canyon, but is now Lake Powell. Big Water, Utah)  As I was out on my daily hike thru the slot canyons, out in the middle of nowhere, I found myself scrambling up on top of a mesa shelf. So, there I was, surrounded by hundreds of miles of endless canyons, on the border of Arizona and Utah, miles away from any ocean, for sure! And as I looked around at my surroundings, I noticed something that at first my brain couldn't make any sense of. Seashells. Thousands upon thousands of little bright, bleached white, seashells. On top of a mesa, in the middle of the high desert, in the middle of nowhere.  I picked up a handful of them, still trying to process what I was seeing, and holding in my hand, all of these white seashells, carpeting the top of this mesa. I start thinking: seashells? Wait....what??? Why HERE??? HOW?? And finally my brain started to catch up with my surroundings. I realized that all of these little mini, white, clamshell looking seashells had been here, right where I was standing, for a period of time beyond my comprehension. Just laying here, unseen by any human..... for hundreds....of thousands..... of YEARS! They'd been there so long, that they weren't exactly 'shell' any longer. They'd become fossilized, out there in the open air and high desert weather, for eons, and become something that felt like ....almost like chalk, but a bit firmer. I could scratch them easily with my fingernail, and if I put a bit of pressure on them, I could snap of little pieces of them, also like chalk would break. It was mind boggling that they somehow managed to STILL be there, as small and fragile as they were, out in the open air, for such a long time, and somehow managed to still be completely intact and perfect, as calcified and fragile as they were. Incredible!  But, there they were, everywhere! They'd ended up there....when the oceans receded. From the part of the continent that is now the American Southwest. Arizona, Utah, Colorado. ALL of it, had at one time, been UNDER the OCEAN. It really blew my mind! Thinking this dry, barren landscape, had once been deep, deep, deep under the freaking ocean! Wow! It's a memory I will never forget, and will never cease to be amazed about.
Big one coming soon to California!!!!!!!!
No one: Me: going to San Francisco for a concert tomorrow watching this 😂
Thank the Lord for Hudnut's research
Geez! "Yellowstone is about to erupt", "the San Andreas is about to shake", and "Betelgeuse is about to go supernova".. and ALL of which, may not happen any time soon
4:26 it hasn’t been 300years since 1906 bub.
Or in the middle of having a surgery.
I would not like living there when you consider a big quake is going to kill tens of thousands...if I were you and you live there, you better get out now.
Fault lines
I just watched  the 1994 earthquake and i DON'T WISH THAT ON ANYONE I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE HAS EVER DONE. BUT THAT WAS IN 1994 AND I WAS CRYING  AS IF IT JUST HAPPENED AND I WAS SITTING IN MY BEDROOM IN 2023. THAT'S THE MOST SCARCEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN, I AM IN WEST VIRGINIA.
could this b why they are taxing people out ?
A most wonderful documentary series on our planet earth history and geology.
The rocks 100 million years old???
Two years later after this video, still hasn't happened...
Eventually everything east of the San Andreas fault will fall into the Atlantic ocean.
San Andreas does NOT go through LA
Costa del Lex, Luthorville, Marina del Lex, Otisburgh... Otisburgh?! OTISBURGH?!!
I live in an area where california doesn't get earthquakes. Remember people,  california is much more than San Francisco and Los Angeles.
It’s not a matter of if the Big One will happen, it is a matter of when. A 10.0 will happen. Nevada will be wine country
Like it would be a BIG LOSS!! If we could lift the people out of there first, then SINK IT!
One day Los Angeles will be side by side with San Francisco according to the San Andreas data. God Bless all the people in those cities and regions! GOD BLESS SOCAL AND NORCAL!
Tropical storm first then everyone will feel the shock
Maybe just maybe we will get lucky and most of the woketard liberal democrat cities will just break off into the sea and will never be heard from again...... with a major obama democrat woketard liberal convention being held right on the beach when the big one hits.......  Semper Fi Merica
Imagine travelling on hyper loop train if they ever have it and tracks moved and all die with a bang
Can’t happen soon enough.  Shithole
San Andrea UnTrusted
This world never fails to amaze me. I wish my species could learn to take better care of it.
It is amazing that youtube will ban videos about current events that don't fit their narrative but will allow this propaganda that has been regurgitated for decades! I remember as a young teen, around 1977, hearing about how the San Andreas fault was going to have a major quake and California would slide into the ocean! It is not so funny to hear that same stupidity refabricated 40 + years later! Give it up chicken little the sky isn't going to fall and the San Andreas is no more "active" than it ever has been in the past! "Disaster About To Strike" is just more fear mongering propaganda from those that desire to control the people who are dumb enough to believe them!
I felt the ground swaying underneath me while washing dishes in los Angeles 2020 during covid and thay day mexico had a 7 .5 quake the coyotes would howl at nite and that quake was probably 1500 miles away course no damage so i do believe when it the epicenter strikes at souhern mexico border a 7.5 quake or higher and that distance 150 miles oh my oh my it will be bad real bad the rock is denser there in1812 new madrids quake many speculate an 8.0  quake dense rock made the church bells swing in boston that quake reshaped the mississispi when the big one happens i bet lajolla totally falls in the ocean
No wear and tear..never went to that depth..rush intended to turn back and keep the money as previous..it sank uncontrollably past his intended turn back point.
I was there for Coalinga and recently China Lake...n both times I thought "i" was dizzy!  Then noticed things swaying... The 2 things in common were the high pitched dog barking! It's like the dogs vocalize an octave or more above what's normal...what we barely notice.  Then...for about 15-30 seconds it's dead quiet.
What northern states were the last hold outs on slavery?
18:53 Methodological Error
And now we’ve let them build an island in the South China Sea, so now they got the upper hand.
You don't f****** know how old Earth is don't fool yourself
History Channel should be renamed
I've been hearing about "the BIG ONE" since the 1971 quake. I' sure it will happen...likely in the next 1000 years.
Our FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN HALLOWED BE THY NAME THY KINGDOM COME THY WILL be DONE in earth as. It IS in heaven give us this day our daily BREAD AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS AS WE FORGIVE OUR DEBTORS AND LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION. BUT DELIVER US FROM EVIL FOR THINE IS the kingdom and the power AND THE GLORY FOR EVER AMEN
California is ran by idiots. No desalination, no forestation, and the rest of the USA has to keep bailing them out financially. We can do without southern Cali.
carbon dating is flawed they are assuming the rate of decay is consistant of the time period they claim but no one has been able to prove that since carbon dating only has been around for about 50 years
Thats CRAZY

Yes BUT, The special consul must be closely vetted. We've already seen what happens with certain special consuls not closely screened. It just spreads the corruption problem around. 🇺🇸
I've never read or heard from any scientific sources that a subduction fault could change into a strike/slip fault...what are you people smoking  ?
This country needs the San Andreas & Cascadia faults to both go from Baja to Vancouver !
Tenno
Climate change obviouslyyyy
I pray it doesn’t happen anytime soon

"California has IT's Faults"🤣
Anyone else notice the fast moving white dot flying over the ocean, close to to shoreline? 9:44
My grandfather credit, the only algorithm that ever predicted earthquake before it occurred
What if we were to bevel very deeply into pressure points along the tectonic plate, fault line? And instill sensors to let us know. Or give us a little bit of foresight before seismic incident was to occur. But even more what if we were to go down into those subterranean tunnels, and the pressure points of the fault lines and put pyrotechnic charges to give a precursor of alleviation to the pressure before an incident occurred. At the very least, we would have a little bit of time to let citizens know to get to safety like a fire drill. And if it didn’t work, at least we would’ve done a fire drill so more people would live. I’m not seeing it down side to this.
Something doesn’t add up. Freeways cross that same fault but they aren’t having to shift the roads. How do you explain that?
Haha live by the fault die by the fault haha get it live by the G die by the G
Parkfield has earth quakes almost daily what is this guy talking about decades? Yes it is the earth quake center of the world.
The PINNICELS were in southern California there are the same kind of stones in northern San Diego hills.
Its crazy how the 1906 earthquake literally caused entire coastal cliffsides to fall into the ocean.
Why would anybody live in California it's a s*******
And yet, property values in that shithole town continue to skyrocket. I'll never understand.
Wait. We've only known about plate tectonics for 40 years? 🧐🧐🧐
As in detail revealed the questions of interest to me on this topic. Thank you very much for your channel.
besides being far from home, this is one of the things that is seriously discouraging me from ever moving to the west coast. as someone from the mid atlantic, we basically never have natural disasters. maybe a power outage from a hurricane or a tornado watch every few years. it's mind boggling that people know a disaster this big could strike right where they live and they aren't always anxious about it lol.
I love reading the uneducated comments. It's hilarious.
California’s citizens living in constant peril has nothing to do with earthquakes and everything to do with liberal democrat policies 😂
nice
I live in Northwest Arkansas in the River Valley and I’m really worried about the New Madrid fault having a really bad quake but I really worry for California and surrounding states too. I’ve only been through one earthquake and it was on the other side of the state and only a 4.4. Definitely got respect to people that live there. I’m fine with chancing Tornadoes like y’all chance earthquakes.
Did it hit yet? Still waiting.
Live one day at a time
I love watching these videos it show me how much most of us anit ready....
Hey! That’s my fault!!!
I just hope I’m not sitting on the toilet with the Hershey squirts when it happens
Ppl dumb enough to keep building in areas prone to have any type of natural disasters are beyond help. Idiots And LA is a cesspool that needs to be washed clean.
I’d love to see the day it happened
Don’t worry everyone, you’re vaccinated.
I missed the Northridge Earthquake but I clearly remember the 1971 Sylmar Earthquake and trying to walk down to my parents bedroom and my dad telling me to go back to bed “its only an earthquake.” I remember the hallway swaying back and forth as I tried to make it to my parents bedroom. I was 4 at the time and I remember it like it was yesterday. I am 56 now.
Is San Andreas responsible for ALL of California's earthquake?
I want all my favorite and loved and wealthy artist, and inventor etc to get tf out of California. Never should’ve built a city anywhere near that seismically active area smh. Crazy 😂
Look at Turkey 😢
The axis is tilting, so gravity is pulling the Pacific plate away from the American plate; it's no big, complicated mystery!
I certainly don't wish harm on anyone with something like this that could erupt at any time. I enjoy this documentary very much very intuitive!
I know not to wish harm on anyone...I just hope if this does happen, that people help eachother through the disaster rather than rob jewelry or shoe stores.
Just head to the mountains or highest point now!!!
Giant asteroid hit Wyoming Eons before Dinosaurs, all mountains on US west coast aré debris From the fall back of impact! - inmense power created all GOLD deposits west of Rockies!
The Rapture is about to happen
The truth is there are no secrets, and the containment of stupid people, Taxpayers..
I lived in porter ranch, California from 1977-2021. It’s scary to think about it. I heard that every earthquake of the 4 big faults has already occurred except the San Andreas fault.
We will like to know the impact a mayor earthquake could have in the USA and the rest of the World!?😱😳🙏🙏
There is only "one" thing we can be sure of in the Future!
They mentioned the "Sonic Boom" phenomenon way back in and after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.
I was going to say it’s weird hearing about the earth moving from where I am and then I realized we’re under the New Madrid fault. Uh oh.
2023. Waiting
Sooner the better.
We all have nothing better to do enjoy the show
Well that's not going to happen
Still waiting 😳
Location and building codes are key in survival. 43:05 "An estimated 2,000 deaths".  On 02/06/23, Turkey/Syria had a major earthquake, and their death toll is over 53,000.
After THE BIG ONE Los Angles city council will mandate skyscraper tents
It is my belief that this particular documentaries holding back everything that matters... I'm sure discretion is prudent.
I'm a skeptic about prophetic information in the Bible.. However, I have to admit that most of what they have said has come to pass... Our world is in a horrible place... Brothers and sisters hating one another for the color of their skin.. or their social level or their politics... Perhaps our world is ready for a reset..... Time to get right with God... Enjoy eternal life... Perhaps the worst thing over our pending nightmare... Is to be alive.... Make the right choices.. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏☝🏻
Learn to swim
Can't wait to see California fall into the Pacific ocean.  This state is the most corrupt place in America.  The best thing for it is to dissappear for good.  And along with its people.   Don't know why God has let it last this long.
Oops. Two years old now. Maybe time to take this failed prophecy down.
Im just glad I live in Virginia 🤣🤣
It's very sad n God bless  n protect  the earth 🌎 🙏 🙏
None of this is actually factual. It’s speculation based on science which is a lot of guess work. Don’t believe everything your told. Not even what I’m telling you
We have only kept records for about 100 years.  We have ZERO idea of how powerful quakes were long before us.
And again all wrong turkey came first Wait for the next full moon and eclips
“The only thing certain is nothing is certain” 😂
STOP...NOT MILLION ANYTHING...6783 YEARS SINCE ADAM & EVE!!!!
I've never lived in California, but I felt a small quake where I lived. It did feel like a wave in water. I was in a low lying valley. When it happened I could hear it come across the valley like a moving truck engine. Then it felt like a small wave in water as it ran underneath me. It lifted up in a rolling motion as my house shook. Then I could hear it move away from me across the valley. It was such a weird feeling.

That won't be good with snow on the ground
California sinks my home of Hawai’i gets cleaned out fak up America still make things hard for us Hawaiians
Waiting for CA to sink into the ocean for good and every vile democrat with it.
Yellowstone valcano is going to erupt; when the tatonic plates snap apart.
The smaller quakes are slowing down due to the tatonic plates being jammed. However the pressure between the plates will get overwhelmed. Major quake coming because the plates are going to snap apart in the blink of an eye. Be prepared.
Gojira has been tunneling for a long time. He's HUNGRY! Soon he will feast!
Who’s fault is the San Andreas fault? 🤔🤔🤔
Yes, but are they vaccinated?
ONE CAN HOPE CA DROPS, US WILL BE BETTER OF AND OUR HUMAN CULTURE
Oh and the Reaper who said I wish Hollywood was shaking to the ocean you said exactly what you are when you started that statement yes you are sorry you are a sorry excuse for a human being
You needs Oscar for your creativity and how are always make people smile your such a great dancer ❤
So basically we know southern California is a ticking time bomb.With that in mind don't be mad when I don't help in the rebuild.
They're already said California is going to fall off in the ocean
Noah built an Ark for a reason...  biblical flood documents an ancient past. Yet, as glacier ice melt away, one thing leads to another.
Los Angeles is a caldura
It must be the fault of some Right-Wing Conservative Republican. Next incident of the San Andreas Fault is scheduled for 2064 (give or take). I wouldn't want to be a Republican politician in office at that time.
HaShem, Mercy!   ...

Where in biblical times the last days
You know, with all these earthquakes happening around the world, it makes me wonder when will we have a huge one here in the states. So far we have been leading a charmed existence in this department. This can't go on forever. I live in Ohio and we have roughly about 1,200 fault lines that are underneath our state. At least that's what I read somewhere at one time. I'm more concerned about the west coast and Yellowstone more than anything. The one fault line that would affect us here in Ohio would be the New Madrid Fault System even though it's several hundred miles away. There are skeptics here in the east about earthquakes happening here even though we've had them over the years. I am a very firm believer since one struck here in the Ohio Valley when I was in the 9th grade and it was hundreds of miles away. We got dismissed from school early because it actually did some damage to roads and caused rock slides. I have has this interest in earthquakes since then.
The Cascadia zone is far more menacing than the San Andreas. We could be looking at what happened in Japan in 2011 since that rupture zone is capable of a 9.0 earthquake and tsunami which the San Andreas can't. Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver all within striking distance.
The Responsable of all that is D. Trump.  Lol
Get out of Los Angeles!
Watching this February 20 2023 like 😳😳😳😳
Hollister has quakes ALL THE TIME.  They had 2 this last week, a 3.9 and a 3.4. They had a 4.7 a month or so ago.
Lets see if this happens in 2023. Its all been theory until now. We will have something new to talk if that happens
I'm on the east coast and have been hearing for years that "The Big One" will happen in CA at any time.I I know that it's beautiful and the weather is great  but there  are too many forest fires, droughts  and landslides. To me the earthquakes are a major threat so I don't understand why people live there!
Quiero ver este vídeo en ESPAÑOL POR FAVOR
Just make the cutoff point halfway between Hollywood and San Francisco cuz I live in the latter, born and raised! 😉
Several months ago I had a vivid dream that the big one struck, LA took the major damage. I even remember the magnitude, it was a 9.2. I also recall seeing the US Bank tower collapse. I also remember trying to run away, as if that’s possible for an earthquake, and I was seeing the ground around me just violently shaking. Then after it stopped, a storm approached. Tbh another major panic would be the nighttime, power is out and the only light you can see is the raging fires in the distance
Pogi ako 😂
Good morning 😊😅😮😢🎉😂❤ 8:03am
So what we should expect from our local, state, and federal government is preparation on a scale we have never seen before. Look at our lunatic, fractured “leadership,” and you’ll see that that thinking is a fairy tale.
Let GODs will be  done,  even if this wasn't his will, maybe.
Hudnut, lol
CLOSE TO THE SEA IS IMPORTANT TO ALL NATIONS!!!!  SOME ARE NOT!!!!!
TEACH EVERYONE WHAT TO DO!!!! BE TRUTHFUL  ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF SMALL ONES WITH TIME IN BETWEEN IS BETTER THEN ANY BIG ONE ALL AT ONCE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So what they are saying is that everyone in LA should be ready to surf to Denver any day now.
When u do your charities wrong uu r left with nothing remebrr that
What do u think k happens when family neglects family..they separate so there's ur mirror. Nobody is gonna be put out thier home cause of folks who overcharge the folks giving them the lands
In 1994, I lived in Arlington , Arizona, and when the Northridge quake hit, it woke us up very early in the morning.  The news was awash of all the pools in Glendale , Arizona that had sloshed with the quake in Northridge.
Like mom's said, if you're treating others you like to be treated then you're less likely yo been having a rock thrown at you,dad.
❤
RUN! ITS ALL OVER! THE END IS NEAR!   FLMAO RUN! RUN! LOL
I REMEMBER  BEING IN THE MADRID FAULT EARTHQUAKE  / THANK GOD I LIVED THRU IT /  IT WAS FELT  CLEAR UP TO NORTHEAST MISSOURI / I COULDN'T  EVEN CALL MY PARENT'S  TO LET THEM KNOW I WAS OK !!
Lie after lie. The earth was created by YAHWEH. Evolution is a lie. Stop saying that 26 billion years ago there was a big bang. If evolution is true, how come galaxies still forming? Where dreams come from. Where life itself come from? How come the whole universe is so organized. Stop liying
And still no warning system. Smh
The world waits with GREAT anticipation!
To bad there wasn't a 3000 year time lapse video of the San Andreas fault sliding to the northwest that would be cool to see
They've been saying that the San Andreas fault is going to give way for zillions of years. And if it does go, Hasta la pasta baby.
See you down in Arizona bay.
To all who wish bad luck, especially death, on huge groups of people --- especially their own countrymen/women, you would be wise to rethink your wishes. Time after time the opposite of those wishes has occurred. Bad fortune wished on others has returned to the person who thinks it. No human being, in God's opinion, has the right to cause death to another human being.      Thou shall not kill.   Ring a bell? Good night all, and may God bless each and everyone of you with healing if you're sick, abundance if you need it, love when you give love, and much happiness all the days of your lives. Good night all.
Yea I definitely will stay where I'm living I got Lil kids and can't be stressing about that kind of harm to any of us I'm good I stress about enough
Who else is here hoping California falls into the ocean and wipes out Hollywood? 🤣😂
Not buying into the 20-100 million year theory. It is pure theory not based in any provable fact. My theory is just as valid except i dont have a so called degree in malarkey. My geology teacher thought i should be a geologist, but i didnt have the urge, although it is an interesting subject for me.
Unfortunately Hollywood has already moved itself to Georgia in preparation for California collapsing and so we will not be able to rid the world of the filth they keep spewing.
I so hope that California just becomes part of the ocean
Somebody needs to study geophysics.
Sorry folks we can't predict earthquakes
I call bullchit I live 25 miles from Hollister and there have been earthquakes
If you didn't have enough reasons to move out of California...
California will break and be flooded get those 🏄 surf boards ready. 😀
I was 5 when the 89 Quake hit. My Dad took me to Toys R US to get a Cabbage Patch doll. We just got out of the car, walking hand In hand...almost to the entrance...when BOOM..it happened. I recall my father grabbing the back of my shirt and holding me in the air until I threw a MAAASIVE level 5 tantrum. Lmao I remember throwing myself out stretched like an ironing board just stiff thinking I'd out run him to get into the store lol. We never did make it inside. Windows broke, the ground cracked...Never did get the Cabbage Patch. What a crock
I remember watching Escape from LA with Kurt Russel.. the best movie to know how LA would be after the next earthquack. Wonderful movie, 666 es the number for switch off the entire world. May not  forget it..
I lived in So. Cal. for 50 years I was born there. Kind of odd that many of the earthquakes strike in the mourning hours. I wonder why ?.
2 years old
Is it or are you FEARMONGERING us more ⁉️
Oi can't wait for the big quake to wipe out the Scum of Hollywood.lm living for it !!!
Does anybody think about a young earth . About 10 thousand years old . And the flood changing everything ❓
And now California is under water
Geology was my science/math requirement in college so I like to think that I have a little bit more and better than average knowledge of this subject. Now, it was refreshing to view something that was factual and not fictional, sensational, a love story or with villains in it. My observation has and still is that there has been activity in the Northern and Southern thirds of the fault. When will the middle third have activity? Has Fresno ever had any activity? Also, by the way, other than Yellowstone, there are another two or three calderas in the Western part of the lower contiguous 48.
One thing is for sure I would not want to live in CA. I love my life too much and as far as I a concerned they should just abandon those cities and the coast
{{q8
Everyone is hoping that California falls into the ocean.
I love this topic!  It certainly has a place in the minds of Californians, and these brilliant scientists are putting our faces directly into the picture for us to see!  My question is the same one it's always been:  Why do humans build on top of dangerous ground??!  The earth is far tougher than we will ever be, and in a people vs. earthquake scenario, the earthquake always claims lives.  I've only felt a few relatively small tremors in Sacramento, walking into the building I work in as the florescent lights swing from the ceiling (1989 Loma prieta)  but I've seen what seems like every San Francisco and Los Angeles earthquake documentary made, up to 2021 at least . . . and now we wait.  tick tock tick tock . . . .take it away, Lord!
Which is why all those sky scrapers should never have been built.
I lived for 20 years in North Los Angeles County just west of the San Andreas Fault felt numerous earthquakes the biggest one I felt was 5.7 and 2008. I have since moved back to my home state where it gets 30 below zero and a lot of snow in the winter time best thing I ever did.
Honestly good, that part of the country is such an embarrassing gaggle of humans. I hope it's quick.
I'm living in California and this is fake news  0 Big Earthquakes
Dutchsinse on youtube is getting pretty accurate in predicting earthquakes
Yes Hollywood to bottom of ocean, hmm ,the fault would 'clean so, cal. Very nice !
What if earthquakes are being triggered purposely
2030
After watching these episodes, especially I am interested in the San Andreas Fault as it is directly related to potentially major Earthquake in California, i have some vague ideas that if we somehow drilling into the areas that has the strong sesmesis activities, or somehow trying to negate the building up energy of the magma chamber little by little, of course human power is nowhere to match with mother nature power, but if we gradually drilling a little by little, it may make the earthquake energy slow down........not sure.....if scientists try to test this theory? (its because the earthquake energy is going upward, if we drill downward, it is negating the upward, but have to be super careful not to cause direct forces) Prevention is always better than treatment! we have nothing to lose to test something that may prevent tremendous disasters to come.....
So I woke to a good movie.. ….
Is it due to man trying to route water from outside of the west to sw usa
Turn down the back ground music
Your state has started years ago. Not much time left. Water is empty. Cannot live on water. No rain. No dew. No animals. Blood and horrors only increases it. You chose death. You live in a dying state.
It will be glorious when this thing pops off and slides LA and SF into the sea. America will become a much better place when it does. I'm a fan of San Andreas!
Hmm and this is two years old.
Is anyone ready for the next event to happen and when.
I guess you can say all of the small earthquakes are just the ground snoring but when it roars it’s going to be the big one
💙
Thank you!  This was a good one. My daughter and her husband are engineers. He's well known in his profession as an expert on quake proofing buildings (or whatever its called)  He was part of the team that went to Haiti after their terrible quake. I've received a very mini education re quakes. My daughter was in the quake of 89. She wasn't injured, but she lost a friend who worked in a small brick built bakery in Santa Cruz. I was born in California San Francisco Bay Area, about 40 minutes from SF, and I remember a few small quakes, but nothing serious at all. I lived in Northern California when the 89 quake hit, and seeing the Bay Bridge torn like that was surreal. I'd been across that bridge countless times. Anyway, I have questions after watching this, and people in my family who can answer them! That's nice!
12/3/2022 In 1968 or 1969 I was living in Coronado, California. At about 4:30 pm (I don't remember the date) I experienced a 6.5 earth quake, which was followed at least one 4.0+ aftershock. The epicenter was very near the mentioned Sultan Sea. It was quite the experience for a mid west boy.  To this day I am sensitive to earth tremors. Living in Atlanta, we experience many very minor shocks. I feel them, they feel like a heavily loaded truck has passed close by at speed. It kind of feels like sitting in your car on a bridge when the truck passes. The big one will strike one day. Just when I don't think any one, but God knows that. ;-)
My people, you have seen ripples in the clouds as frequency patterns in Indiana. You have also seen dead birds in the area around the New Madrid fault. These are signs that the HAARP machine of one billion watt microwaves is going to be used to cause a greater than 8.0 earthquake that will split America in two. In the vision you are seeing at least one skyscraper collapsing from this coming quake. There will also be a great flow of water coming down the Mississippi River that will widen its size. There will be a fair number of people killed, but this number will be lessened because of your Mass intentions. The damage to homes and buildings will be worse than the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. When this event happens, you will see a martial law declared that could be used for a takeover of America. I will warn My people when it will be time to go to My refuges. This earthquake on the New Madrid fault will be followed by another earthquake on the San Andreas fault. Be prepared to leave, and go to Confession.

When the world become so decadent, it will be cleansed by flood and fire.
So basically humans didn't learn their lesson from the last major earthquake and build a mega city right by the fault line.. 🙄
As I watch this video I am wondering if they ever thought about  putting two large stake made of cement with painted tops on them so they can measure any movement up or down over a period of time.
Well this video is two years old and California is still there so I'm calling BS
IT WILL BE TOO LATE TO BELIEVE AND REPENT AND TOO LATE TO NEGOTIATE.
California is one wild place to live! Earthquakes, forest fires , mud slides , never a full moment! 🤔🤯🤯🤯Now California is running out if drinking water due to excessive drought! WATER IS LIFE! Better start listening to Native Americans USA!
Does FRACKING make earthquakes more common???? Thank God Maryland has outlawed FRACKING but unfortunately, WV, PA our neighbors continue to FRACK!🤔🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
About to strike.... Normally I accord these "bait lines" , but I thought I'd look. What does about to strike mean? Now One month Five months  When??    I used to trust these channels
Sylmar earthquake was the biggest I went through
Who else seen the pirate ship in the video at 9:33 minutes into the video
It will happen When it happens  Burn your candle at both ends
It's not right to fool Mother Nature.
They’ve been talking about the “big one” since I was in grade school. I’m 67 now.
Hollywood ? Burn Vegas down . It’ll make me even with them in debt
The question is when not if... and this is 2 yrs old🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Now tell the Rest of the story.... Obama sold the Land Title of California to China in exchange for the funds to perform his infamous Bailouts. Then all of a sudden, floods, wildfires, storms, All centered around Cali, homeless takeover, and a Worthless Pathetic Corrupt Governor. Then came the movie San Andreas with the Rock, trying to warn us about extreme corruption effecting the earth. Then all these predictions come out of the woodwork from unknown sources that the fault WILL break away and destroy Cali. Nobody wanted China to move in, they bought it solely for silicon valley, works perfect for their electronics industry, no room or infrastructure to build it in China. Then the final straw when a reporter went deep into the fault and discovered explosive charges planted along the fault with remote detonators. After reporting on a social media site, that reporter had a terrible car accident and died...... Cover up! Finally the wealthy in Cali got the message, saw the Chinese military tanks ( black with a red star) arrive on train cars and hidden at the Cali border, and they've been packing their homes and fleeing cali ever since. It doesn't matter if you laugh or say stupid things like conspiracy, that will be to your demise, and will not effect any of us. Biden and Pelosi sealed the coffin with their corrupt deals with China. And Plenty of reporters have noted that China is getting prepared for a HUGE invasion, then uncovered Chinese police stations appearing all over the Nation along with China owned Walmart and Sam's club buildings that are empty now have cyclone fencing around the parking lot and Armed guards inside, preparing prison camps. It's gonna be Fun, better start learning Chinese!!!
I dont believe people didnt know earthquakes before 1900
Hollywood? Go way beyond this planet
With what happened in 1906, you can be sure you we have 10,000 to 50,000 years before the next big event on the fault.      The fact that it happened 100 years ago is not 'proof it is going to happen again soon', more, it is not likely to happen again for a LONG time.
Northridge earthquake was nothing compared to the Loma prieta quake.
I was on the epicenter of the 1989 7.1 earthquake. I was just on the Pacific side. We moved 15 feet to the north and six feet higher.
I concede that 99.9999999% of all scientists are smarter than me.  But I don't believe you can replicate an earthquake on a piece of plexiglass.
from watching so many of these types of videos no one ever mentioned the big cali quake could also set yellow stone off as well.
Anyone, and I do mean ANYONE who continues to live along a faultline,  or an area that has severe flooding that causes damage on a regular basis, or anywhere that epeatedly  has disasters such as huricanes or whatever, those people who stay there are crazy.   Next time it happens and there are all these funds asking for donations that set up to help the people who live in those areas,  DON'T send them money.... send them LUGGAGE or BUS TICKETS so they can get out of there and move somewhere else.
San Francisco and L.A. in one natural disaster? Hmmmmm The average lifetime is 77 years...DO you think in 77 years there might be an earthquake in a earthquake zone? If you CHOOSE to live there--stop whinging unless you want to blame the fault and earthquakes on MAGA people.
Always thought that injury and death predictions were really..... Unrealistically mild I've done some rescue work and was present for a pretty big earthquake and the place I was in did not have the numbers or modern large building works. It was pretty horrific, I think LA would be in even worse shape if it happened at this point in time than what was predicted.
Not to worry jewtube I screenshot all my post to JEWTUBE to show the population your biased opinion 😉
We can only hope the whole state of commiefornia falls off!!!
Can't all of California just fall off and all will be good!!!
Nothing personal, but it can't fall off fast enough!!! Bye Felicia!!!
If they keep building and building they interrupting the surface of the earth core.  They keep expanding Las Vegas…somehow cause a leak in Lake Mead… water shortage.  Tapping on the core surface will cause stress
Because scientist says it’s not a matter of if it’s a matter when, and we know the tectonic plates are moving. Would it not behoove us to drill into the pressure points of the tension in the tectonic plates in a subterranean terraforming Parsons Brinkerhoff, Diamond underground drill, (the folks that are currently digging tunnels under LA type of way?) Could we not put like charges they could detonate in key points underground they could alleviate the tension in small ways before it occurs in a devastating type fashion?
Think 1998.... I was there...that was a small one
10.1 quake 2023.
5:16 Love how the earth tore apart by 8 feet and yet the grass stayed fully intact! 😂
Would you really expect a commie democrat to say anything except “ nothing to see here”.
20 million yrs ago...what bs. Zero technology...bible mans history period.. God spoke creation and no earth existed
This is bs epoch ... for the love of money we are being censored by you for not subscribing. The kukai never stops and i know i put you on map because no one knew of epoch less than 5 yrs ago or works re spy gate. I source referenced you through china news channels... hello
Been here all mine life here LA,  born 64 .. felt all earthquake.  First one hit in 70 or 71 .. still remember it till this day
The next earthquake will be the anvil to break the camel,'s back that will put California, a state already falling apart, in a realm permanently unfixable. The massive damage will overwhelm what that state already can't handle economically.
This fault is the top of a dirt mound, the top of the front. The rear is the Sierra foothills, that’s where it will fall and everything towards the ocean from there will be under water. Bay Area will be a island range
They live in constant peril from CRIME! Hiding under flimsy desks reminds me of the nuclear bomb drills in the 60s. Both are absurd.
I know money was tight then too but we should of moved all major cities away from the fault. The End
This guy narrates drugs Inc.?
Bye-bye I hope you can swim if  you're not smart enough to move away.
Lord pls help us🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏in JESUS NAME AMEN.
This is a rural area.  The animals give us a  wealth of knowledge as to when an earthquake may be about to happen.  The animals are predictable when a storm is coming.  Why not an earthquake?!
The History Channell is so behind the times. Maybe they should watch Dutchsense a time or two. Earthquakes are no longer unpredictable. The USGS just doesn't want the population to know that there is a functional theory which is quickly being proven, on a daily basis.
This would make it hard for  property owners to know their property lines for ownership.
We live in a time where disasters are looked for and anticipated In a sense. But people in California seem to be ignorant to facts. The big one, it seems ,will come sooner rather than later I believe. When it does it will be such as has never been seen on earth. And Los Angeles shall be no more. Loss of life will be catastrophic and unbelievable. Tis a fool to ignore the inevitable.
Earthquakes can be predicted, but, will they let us know on time to save "our lives "? I doubt
My dad, Geophysics, Oceanography,Ocean Science,...go for it everyone!
There needs to be a big shake up in California.
one thing i found intersting about a erthquake that was felt from below LA clear to south shore lake taho usuly quakes seem to be locoleised to a cerntern area with outword waves from a epacenter for a rather short distence but this one was difrint i wonder what that means? thare was people calling in to a radio station i was listining to from below LA to lake taho and i felt it to witch was realy rare for me to feel a quake whare i lived
I don't believe that hypothesis is Correct, or there should be a clean separation between the west coast of North America in that location, and the Pacific Mantle Plate. It shouldn't have a fault running through North American Mantle surface Lands. What I believe has happened is that when an Asteroid traveling with other Asteroids crashed into North America at Now Hudson Bay, this sent a tremendous amount of energy running through North America, mostly in Northern areas & Westerly. That separated Greenland from North America, and turned solid Land into Islands North & Northwest of Hudson Bay, the evidence is there. But this was not all that occurred with that Meteor Impact! It should be traceable that this impact sent much of that energy to the West of Hudson Bay, along with cracking most of North America in Canada running from the upper Northwest, diagonally down to South Carolina running Southeast. But the Western Energy traveled to the West coast of North America creating what is now River ways from land separations that also includes The Columbia River Valleys, that ended running through Portland Oregon. Then turned right and left carving out Vancouver Island to the North, then going out to cross The Ring of Fire fault in the Pacific, then turning left to create The Wanda Fucca fault running down to San Francisco. Then re-entered Mantle surface Lands and carved through North America creating The San Andreas fault & others, running down to The Gulf of California. Then becoming The Imperial Fault running down to The South American Region, and ending there. Along with the Asteroid that impacted at Hudson Bay, I believe other Asteroids traveling with it impacted and created The Great Lakes Basins. While other smaller Meteors also crashed along with these larger ones creating the many lakes in Minnesota, Canada and also in The Northeastern United States. I also believe another large Asteroid traveling with that Group, impacted to create The Gulf of Mexico, but was Not a direct hit and slid to the left. As it may have hit on Sandy Lands that were Not mostly hardened Rock Bases.
When was this first aired?
I've been waiting a long time for the San Andreas fault to just take California into the ocean best thing that could happen to that state
Stay strong and be prepared save as many people as possible and remember the animals we should save them all
Being in an earthquake is nuts. I Grew up in Southern California.  I left in 99. But once you're used to it. It's not scary. Grant it I lived quite a ways away when the Northridge earthquake hit. But it shook our house.
Earthquakes are terrifying.  I experienced 2 earthquakes while living in CA.  Nothing you can do, nowhere you can go.  Just get under structural part of building like a stairwell.  That's it, and pray a lot.
FUN!!  Hello from San Francisco.  I never even think about these things.
I live 4 blocks away from Mussel Rock,  right next to fault line.  I've witnessed several cliff erosion, when then hill just falls into to ocean.  Pretty place but dangerous, I guess?
When driving from LAX to EAFB on HWY 14 one can see exactly what earthquakes over millions of years ago have done, where the road was cut thru the high country.  Mother Nature cannot be controlled.  What the California Government has done is worse. Government must be shrunk.
How likely is it that the next earthquake will be felt by other states as well?
Earthquakes are not the only threat. There is also the threat of future volcanic eruptions. While earthquakes are more common than a volcanic eruption, parts of California have geothermal activity that is caused by volcanic activity.

Wtf w all the soundtrack?? Annoying and distracting
They say these “millions and billions” as if they actually have it down to a number. They have no idea and it’s laughable to even suggest those kinds of numbers
II grew up in the Calif Bay Area, and I must have been through 200 or more earthquakes as a kid growing up in Calif. As the guy said, earthquakes can be fun, and if lucky, you might get out of school, and as a kid back then, anytime you get out of school is always fun. The Loma Prietà quake changed my mind about fun, and all I can remember is me and my brother running outside only to see the telephone poles swinging as one could break at any time. The worst part of earthquakes is the after-shocks that come after the first one because those can be bigger or smaller. In the case of Loma Prieta we had after-shocks for days just like God was talking?
I remember the 87 Whittier Narrows quake, the 89 Loma Prieta quake, felt both the Landers and Big Bear Quakes in 92, none were as frightening as the 94' Northridge Quake, and I've never been through anything worse. Unfortunately, we're way overdue for a big quake here in LA.
California is cursed
This is how stupid people are they know there's a fault line but yeah they just kept building houses and businesses and schools and and that can happen at any moment I've been at any moment it's almost like they're playing monopoly and rewiped the board and used it Again
My grandparents lived in Hollister and we felt earthquakes all the time!
So.. wouldnt this be even worse for Japan and Australia? Afterall, losing California would be an immediate favor to the citizenry of the United States... the amount of bozos that live on the west coast of the USA is insane..
TRUE FACTS here
We're still anticipating sea views here in the foothills of NoCal...
I don't know why they say Hollister does not get earthquakes I feel them quite often and then 89 they had a larger earthquake here I live in Hollister for a long time
Also I noticed brick and cement buildings were damaged the most would buildings held up good if there was no fire if you're going to live on the fault line I suggest you get a wooden house
I can open my back door and see the mountain split the San Andreas fault line I was hearing 89 in my home it was built in 1800s it rocked and rolled but not half the water out of my doughboy swimming pool but I was okay and so was the house in town it knocked buildings down Hollister California it might be like a pond when you throw a rock in the water the shock waves get bigger as they go out maybe it was because I'm on top of it it was a good thing
Sweet
Hello California citizens . Don't worry the experts are wrong . Stay where you are , nothing is going to happen .  California is for the beautiful people and you're surely one of them . Get a good beauty sleep there is nothing to worry about !! Party on dudes !!
Arizona to be beach front property  " GOD WILLING  "
Yes life matters more to us we're more attentive to our rest of our golden years then we were when we were young I was more more history I am very interested with my world
What about the Hayward fault?
Leave now
We know that it will happen, we don't know when, or how big it will be? We know that the area is geologically unstable, let's build a major metropolitan area here. We can bring lots of people and put up tall buildings for them to live in.
WHY is so much of the 2022 Seismic activity (earthquakes) being surpressed from the public?
It’s funny how the only thing that really makes an earthquake dangerous is man made structures
God gave us the earth to take care of us , but we mistreated so start taking care of it clean the land cleaned the water so it takes care of us,amen
So..............If a large quake actually did happen would it affect volcanic eruptions like Yellowstone ?? I mean Yellowstone and The San Andreas  are close to each other.
Hopefully Gavin Newsome will be right in the middle of the fault-line and even more awsome someone could record it. From far away of course. With like zoom lens. Wouldn't want them to get hurt. 🧐
So look for slippery rock to find the next earthquake?
I believe the narrorator likes his job, when he can say things like Hudnut
I remember my first visit to San Francisco was in July and August of 1989. I remember flying back to LA from SF and seeing the San Andreas Fault and thinking I wonder when this fault will generate another large earthquake. I got my answer on Tuesday October 17th while watching the World Series on TV like everyone else! I’ll never forget it!
Just my opinion, but maybe our time here is almost done, if Yellowstone erupts it will pretty much be the end. We just keep on overpopulating and destroying the earth, why on earth would you build a city on a fault line, yeah in the beginning it was probably not know, but it has been now for many years, what is taken for granted will surely get us in the end
Given California politics the best thing that could happen is it disappears into the sea before the nonsense speads. 😡 👍🇺🇲
We do have a Molding room available for residents to use. You can book it by 3 hour appointment. It is a long wait time, if your configuring a project on your own time, you can make sure that all of your pre-checks are in place before you use the room. Technology sector- why did Right Of purchase on some things- we can only make so many. Wait times can be long.. If its important enough to you that you want daily use- then you can get a right of purchase and do additional trade- 1 hour per week is all that we require. Its not debt- our technology never brakes down.
Love the San Andreas Fault!
These last three quakes in Mexico on september 19 , 1985, 2017 and now 2022 arent a coincidence something is coming san andreas is slowly wakening the ring of fire
we're all gonna die
Youtube is getting ridiculous, interrupted by the same ads 9 times in a 45 minute video 🤨
Dutchsinse is highly accurate in earth quake predictions. Meaning before they happen. Unlike USGS that only tells you after they happen. Check him out
awesome documentary this film was produced in 2009 the clock is ticking socal residents i cant imagine the destruction from this will create i hope the scientist are wrong when they say 99% chance in 30 years that's just bone chilling
Flattening LA would be a gift to mankind.
What dried up the river where the elbow is?
Earthquakes have nothing to do with tectonic plates,  its the WRATH OF GOD!   Jerry Fall well.
Californians know about earthquakes, but how about close to Eastern Europe? I was 11 and there was this huge commotion while we were watching TV; we left our apartment and saw the building next to ours with a gap of 1 meter between them.  Holister, as a brand, was named after this town, but the store has images of surfers and this is what it actually looks like (disappointing, right?).  Great documentary, and makes us appreciate that we’re not in Ca!
Beneath The Surface Volcano Domino Effect Box Springs Mountain Regional Park Moreno Valley CA ( Mead Valley Perris CA Riverside County San Bernardino County Inland Empire etc USGS Volcano Assessment Needed ASAP Escape From San Andreas Also Interstate Route 66 From Santa Monica Pier Reclamation Area US To Other Countries
They’ve been predicting the “big” one for decades! It’s not likely to happen anytime soon
You want to know about earthquake prediction ask dutchsenc he is about 98 %
Think outside the box carbon 14 dating is a crock it is the sole reason that they are so wrong about just about every thing they say
You know what you got it all wrong funny experts don't even know what really happened what caused the subduction what cause the plates to move what broke the plates ???? It's all one event if you can't see it this whole thing is not nearly as old as they think it was all two events
Anyone who says about 20 million years ago, should take first grade over.
Billions of years old and still evolving?  Well that's like, just your opinion man.
Ah, Ha, and the operative word here is, ever "Imagined?" I think film producers and horror film creators have IMAGINED IT ALL by now, don't you?  Nice to live on ground floor with not TALL BUILDINGS around to fall in on you, isn't it ? The 8.0 quake in the 70's was a JOLT that threw my son sleeping in a big arm chair, on to the pillow on the floor;  NEVER since then have we ever wanted to live anywhere but on a FLAT EARTH SURFACE.   Wasn't me who invented gasoline running of cars that BLOW UP upon INPACT, either....and the Northridge Freeway Overpass was another WARNING.
There is nothing less "historical" than the History Channel. I have NEVER seen a history documentary on this channel.
I lived in Japan for 3 years and experienced some good sized earthquakes and then moved to Northern Nevada and we have the occasional earth quakes.  They still scare me!

In 2018 we had a record-breaking 55,000 earthquakes in Alaska.  Since then it's back to  50,000 per year.  Living with the Pacific Ring of Fire volcanoes in view and tectonic plates in subduction literally right under my feet doesn't bother me a bit. Came up here 52 years ago and won't live anywhere else.  The last impressive quake was a 7.2 about 80 miles from here a few years back.
The US has set off more than 1,000 nuclear bomb tests.  Don’t scientists & the government know that these tests can cause massive earthquakes nation wide?  When will we ever learn?  Perhaps after the US ends up in the ocean.
Please please come now please come fast and strike hard make this happen
Glad I moved from there
In 2011 553 people died in the US of tornadoes.  In over 25 years the earthquake death toll in the US is zero.  But if you feel safer in tornado alley,  stay there.
How about educate people instead of the fear mongering title. So lame the direction history channel has been heading the pat decade til now
I remember 50 years ago, while in college, being told that the San Andreas Fault was well overdue for an earthquake and that it could happen any day.
I thought cascadia was a larger fault line than San Andreas.
Who else is here a year later still waiting for disaster to strike..........
Yea.
Well! I’ve been hearing “ any day now “ for sixty years. If an idiot makes a proclamation on almost any subject eventually it may occur.The end of the world, the sun swelling into a red giant, the billion light year away event and all fit in with the San Andreas stupidness.🤮
Nevada, Utah - start working on your fence.
Sweet
I cant wait to see it happen
Omg will California just slid into the ocean already!!! I'm tired of waiting!!!!
Death by denial. Millions will die because of this idiotic behavior. What a waste!
Wasn't there an idiot American politician somewhat recently (as in maybe the last ~2 years or so) who actually made the claim that climate change (man-made) has something to do with this tectonic activity?  If I'm not mistaken there may have even been more than one who made that claim, haha.  All those people who paid attention in elementary school experienced profound shame on their behalf.  I find geology very interesting, yes, but there are even more dire threats facing California / the west coast right now, and it comes at the hands of their unbelievably corrupt and twisted politicians, and their using violent criminals essentially as foot soldiers to control a populace.  It isn't going to have a happy ending if people on that coast don't wake up to what is being done - a little knowledge of history would also help prevent THAT.
Rather than looking at the surface of earth to predict forth coming earthquakes.  (Like a woman looking at her Christal ball). We should look at the people's behavior against the word of God!  Are we behaving like the way the Holy One commanded us to do?  Look at the city of Nineveh in the days of Jonas the prophet.  Their sins were very great in the sight of God!  So, the Lord sent Jonas to warn the people of this city!  And starting with the king of this land, they truly repented before the Lord, whereby Lord with hold His judgments upon them.  This is what California as well as the rest of our nation needs to do!  God is love.  Therefore, He is forbearing with His patience for us to repent of our evil ways and return to Him as His sons and daughters.  But if continue to resist Him, then the consequences will be upon us!  What will you choose?
fingers crossed it swallows Hollyweird and Gov Newsom
I never understood why its called the San Andreas faultline... I live about 30 mins from San Andreas CA and it's on the Eastside of California... but then again I haven't looked into it that much lol
You couldn't pay me enough money to live in Los Angeles or any where near that fault line
IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF IT HAPPENED UNDER PELOSI'S HOUSE.
I call this an hypothesis not an scientific report… but ok
When this happens, some will be bright enough to blame Trump... Go Brandon!
Can't happen fast enough . If you're not smart enough to get out now you deserve what's coming .
We’re in a similar situation in Oregon with the Cascadia Subduction Zone, just waiting for it to rupture and blow us off the map!
Who cares about all that junk. I want to know why the Tall Ship is grounded at Muscle rock? Was that the Irving Johnson?
If California went and had a major earthquake and sunk that would be a good thing
It’s gotten so Evil on the West Coast, wouldn’t surprise me a minute if God didn’t tell his earth to turn loose on that fault.  Wouldn’t surprise me a minute.
Excellent production. Valuable content. Well done, History Channel.
L.A  land taxes are to high anyway
I have live in Los Angeles all 48 years of my life and can tell you people do not want to relive even half of what people lived through during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Pure misery. We had a family parrot at the time and I can still remember the poor thing was so terrified during the shaking that it screamed as if the devil was in the room terrorizing it. I have never heard an animal scream so loud and so piercing in my life. I even suspect that my hearing was damaged from his screaming.  It was years before my parent's insurance finally cooperated and they were able to get money and contractors to repair their house. Many people did not even have a house at all after that. There was a lot of speculation that depending on where one's home, apartment, or business was during the shaking was the main factor in how much damage there was because of the position relative to the waves of energy, (high or low part of the energy waves.) Please God don't let this San Andreas fault thing let loose.
I think am moving the family ta UTAH
Could anyone be evil enough to tunnel under ground and create explosions to cause disaster? Early 1900’s seem to be riddled with disasters kind of like today. Could they have had a great reset back then as well?
I wish it would hurry up and do it during some major Democratic convention.  When it does, the red states have signs up saying ‘No Vacancy’!  😂😂😂
—Whom shall we blame for earthquakes in California? —I think it’s San Andreas’ fault.
I'm praying comifornia breaks off I to the ocean so most of the fools would be out of our country
Hopefully L.A to San Francisco drop into the ocean. That would really help America out. Watch the cancer of liberalism and SJW(woke) sink into the ocean would be a blessing.
Why think all stupid California's migrating to Texas?well we don't want you
It's not if it's when
God SPOKE this Earth and Universe into existence just a little over 6500 years ago.  It’s all right there in the very first chapter of the Book of Genesis.  Not Billions of years.  This guy couldn’t even count to a Billion..
I've been waiting for this big one for 70 years. Every once in a while there's a 5+ in California and suddenly all the experts are on TV all day. A week later, they disappear. They wait in the shadows hoping for another one so they can go back on TV to tell us the big one is going to hit soon.
They been saying this would happen for so many years its very hard to believe now.
Please hurry and drop into the Pacific
It’s been a year… lol
I used to live in Oildale California
Let me add something to think about. I live in Ridgecrest where on July 4th and 5th of 2019, we experienced three earthquakes. A 6.4, 5.4, and 7.1. Living in the desert, I was around for the 1999 Hector Mine event, a 7.0. And in 1992 the 7.3 Landers earthquake.   While the San Andreas fault is fascinating, and capable of a destructive earthquake, it may not happen in our lifetime or even in the next 100 years.   I have lived in California my entire life; 57 years. It is my experience that you are more likely to be affected by a local earthquake. Some of these pack quite a punch and can be quite devastating to local communities. Just look at what happened to Ridgecrest, Landers, Petrolia, Chalfant, Morgan Hill, Coalinga, Tehachapi- just to name a few.   It certainly doesn't hurt to prepare for "The Big One" but don't put all your eggs in one basket. If a smaller, local earthquake hits your community, it may be more than your local emergency services can handle. It can take some time before additional help arrives. That leaves you and your neighbors to help each other. Be prepared to roll up your sleeves and help where you can. Its amazing how a community comes together when disaster strikes. Also be prepared for news crews to take over your town shoving cameras and microphones in your face while there is work to be done.
Music from Bug Wars 🤣🤔?
California may have it's fault, but it doesn't shake me up
I could have told them that. The question they should be paying money for is when. What do their ground movement sensors say? Soon? Never? Or Did Pelosi drink up that money too?
LAUGHABLE, at best. Y'all been brainwashed watching this garbage...goodness...If it starts with "millions of years ago", someone is telling make believe: THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY CHANCE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH LIFE...YOURS, MINE OR THEIRS!!!!
Hollywood style fear mongering.  In modern times, 2 strong earthquakes have struck Los Angeles.  The 6.6 1971 Sylmar/San Fernando EQ and the 6.7 1994 Northridge EQ were both on the southern flank of the Transverse Ranges which bifurcate Los Angeles County.  The San Andreas Fault Zone (SAFZ) runs along the northern flank of the Transverse Ranges in LA Co.  In the Nineties, a series of 7+ earthquakes struck in the Mojave Desert, northeast of the LA Co. region; the 7.3 1992 Landers EQ in San Bernardino Co. and the 7.1 1999 Hector Mine EQ in the Twenty-Nine Palms area of San Bernardino Co.  In 2019, the 7.1 Ridgecrest EQ struck in the China Lake area of Kern Co.  Most of California's 7+ earthquakes of the past 170 years have been along that same trend, not along the SAFZ.  Also, its the SF Bay area segments of the SAFZ, where proximity provides much greater portent.  The main SAFZ branch spawned the 6.9 1989 Loma Prieta EQ, with its epicenter on the SW flank of  San Jose.  The 7.9 1906 San Francisco EQ actually had its epicenter in nearby Daly City, where the SAFZ goes offshore.  The main SAFZ runs under Stanford University's Linear Accelerator, and underlies the center of the SF Peninsula.  The Hayward Fault, the central splay of the SAFZ, along the eastern shore of SF Bay, bifurcates UC Berkeley's football stadium.  Notoriously, the next Big One is forecast for that stretch of the Hayward Fault.  Los Angeles is buffered by 10,000-ft mountain range between it and the nearest stretch of the SAFZ.  But such details don't matter in Hollywood, which is a district of Los Angeles.
Earthquakes occur in Bear Mtn constantly but people have adjusted to that. Colorado collects all the data. I experienced several while living in San Francisco and LA...San Marino and Stephensons Ranch. All horrible and scary. Now living on East Coast i hear about quakes in an unusual location like Vermont and Connecticut so cant run from them.  The big one is coming i believe but hopefully i wont see it or experience it. It must be part of the global warming thought tank.
Oh no!!! Not Cali. Lmfao
A year later and nothing.....  lol
Hurry up super quake! There's a lot of liberals in need of some comeuppance.
Please send Commiefornia out into the sea. We don’t need them.
Why/how did it take more than 300 scientists to figure out what my 4 year old could've told everyone
We can destroy a planet but we can't stabilize a fault line.
"They" still cannot predict when an earthquake will happen. All they know is when the ground shakes.
Lots of fear mongering on Hist channel 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
What about cascadia? Will that be worse than San Andreas to the west coat?
So the Coachella Valley is overdue for a big earthquake. I would not be going to the Coachella music festival, just in case lol.
So the wealthy wicked people who called themselves building underground bunkers will be in for a hellava surprise. Prophecy is fulfilling itself each day, and those who will try to hide will not be allowed.
A globe should have busted open by now wirh all those cracks!😂💯🤣 the earth is a plane
They don't mention how those fired were put out. The Army was brought in to dynamite a row of homes three rows deep to create a fire break.
My great grandmother survived the San Francisco earthquake. She said people were thrown out windows in front of her.
We  could get rid of a heck of a lot of liberals this way
Every time Nancy Pelosi speaks I think about the San Andreas Fault.
11:21 32:37 there’s that 70 tons a pull with the pacific plate
I hope the largest of all of these strikes and levels that cesspool.
i do not really find the earthquakes, tornadoes, volcano's, floods scary, what i do find scary is that people live in the middle of them !?!
I live on the fault. on the other side of what you guys are talking about. I have lived seventy six years on this side and I once  felt a quake. it knocked the plates off the wall.
It will not be great until it breaks off and the area on the western side slides odd into the sea. That will eliminate some of the worst cities in the US, LA and San Fagsisco. GONE along with all the criminals that live there.
They need to dampen the high frequency shock load death spear.  If one drills into the fault and fill with a type of material to absorb and dampen the shock wave frequency it may lesson the mass devastation.   This proves there are actually 2 earthquakes:  First, the shock load spear can be equivalent to a 10.0 or higher, is a first strike ultra high frequency shock-load supersonic earthquake  Second, followed by the traditional earthquake of which are currently being measured.
This is a spammed site, disregard spectacularly idiotic false conclusions..
Who says the Earth is 4.whaterver. Mil. years old?
You haven’t any idea when it will happen so you have some nerve to title this as you have.
I can’t Get any money
On west side of Tennessee, along the Mississippi River, Madrid Fault Line. Winter of 1811-12, major quake made the river flow backwards, forming Reelfoot Lake in N.W. Tennessee.
I so miss the days when the History channel used to make shows about history..
What has China done for the United States ? Steal our technology, Buy our farm land, ship into Mexico for delivery to the US, all the fentanal they can make, China gets our oil reserves Why? Biden owes China? What is it? Hunter? Americans owe China nothing. Last thing we received was poison pet food, leaded paint toys, fxxxed up drywall, the virus. We should not be supporting them with reserve oil, paid for with their slave labor profits.Because Joe and hunter Biden are compromised with their China corruption does not mean we should stand by and let our Country  sold out from under us. Midterm's are near vote them out ,keep them out, make them return all monies made illegally and then have them jailed for all the federal laws they broke.
Why always the dramatic, loud, background music all the time with the History Channel?  So distracting
There is a lot of bs here scientists need funding . This is the way they get it.  Still speculation.  Still theories.  They can not have proof ever . Predictions that's it . So with that said it's bs . It's all about funding that's it . Millions of $$ for guesses . Should have , we think , it might , it could , really think In depth about this,🤔think in real depth about it .
In Hollister I see lots of huge mature trees that move concrete also .
Could this satellite possibly come with speed detection sounds as though the sonic boom is breaking the sound barrier underground
GPS, MEASUREMENTS 😜
Data collected GPS measurements as a feature for the new satellite with web vision technology sonar included with data measurement technologies
🌊🌊🌴🤔🤷🏼‍♀️ I'm thinking something along the lines of we have a digital thermometer that can measure the heat for the density air pressure wind speed something along the lines of this with the feature of the satellite with the site of the web telescope with sonar capabilities that we'll see view deep into the Earth through the Earth's crust the shale or and detect certain size mileage my certain seismetology of the terroir the Earth's pressure the heat the tension expansion, movement🤴🏾
🌎✨🤔👀🧏🏾‍♂️🤷🏼‍♀️ We need something like a satellite that has the vision of the web telescope also equipped with a sonar for x-ray deep within the Earth also with the feature that detects the Earth movement pressures different gauges of everything that we will need to know to try to save lives prevent damage to infrastructure and figure out history for the future generations to forward science
Is there a sonar that may be able to possibly detect the size monitor movement of the Earth the web telescope hey what does it do what all features may it be equipped with besides no maintenance
Sounds like we almost need some type of new technology design I've seen footage of the satellites the x-ray images of the Earth when searching for large pools of mineral resources deep below the Earth surface is there any way of detecting the pressure build up or is there any type of real time history that we could review in very slow time so that your subconscious mind could hear and see everything it will deliver the answers to your train of thought in time with great focus and commitment to the study your subconscious mind will answer these problems giving us a sort of road map in your mind of ideas one idea will link to the next idea one we got two two got three three we got four in agreement if we could study some type of old history on the fault lines of the pressure of the earthquakes of the Aftershock something to that magnitude what is different between stage 1 stage Aftershock what is the difference between gauging before and after the damage of the earthquake what is the difference between the gauging of the most damage to certain particular areas if there have been more over here than there ever has been anywhere what could be possibly the correlation or the difference between those aesthetics
Size monitor 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
could possibly the size micrometer the measuring of the movement of the Earth with the little needles that go into the ground okay could we measure for the pressure buildup maybe and preparation for the snapback of the tectonic plate causing the Earth to shake🤔👀
🦣🦣🦣🦣🌎🤔 it has just occurred to me I watched the ice age movie clips with the dodo bird and they were fighting over the last watermelon and as they lost the watermelon to a I guess some type of volcano or something with lava in it they all said simultaneously at one time the last female  That makes me think after the last woolly mammoth female no matter how many young females there were if they were not able to be bred before the largest male woolly mammy have passed away they would have no reproduction as well as if the last female passed away before a male woolly mammoth could become of age of breeding for reproduction purposes there is a reason why God faced The Woolly Mammoth out and the new era begin New world order implementing of that era
Why didnt they show actual satellite photos of the movement that's been collected over the past 40+ years?  I've seen the photos and you can see the movement of the land.  I dont know why the History channel  wouldnt show that?
Hope California is destroyed..
Knowing all this, why live there??
9 seconds in , and you spew your bullsh!t billions of years
Great true story,book title-"Cowboy Mafia "%
Don’t forget that after that earthquake you’re gonna have a 10,000 story tsunami 🌊 coming at you at 5,000 MPH
Lol I think I should move? Kinda don’t wanna die form an earthquake….
What is this background music called? 29:48
I can't but bring myself to feel sorry for any of them. 🥺
Geologists have found out that a lot of movement in one spot quite often , and a lot of movement perhaps 10's to 100's of miles away on the same fault line is quite normal as the built-up pressures are adjusting. This movement is quite common but in the areas in between get hung up on asperites that makes that section(s) harder to move.  The problem with this is that the pressures continue to build up even though there's no movement. When it breaks loose, the movement can be catastrophic. There are several other faults in California that these pressures are built-up waiting to snap.
We could only hope.
You can't run from these or the tidal waves that follow , even in Virginia we had a quake
In other words, don’t live in California!
I like how at the end the host says the only certainty is that nothing is certain in the evolving story of how the earth was made…well I believe the only one that knows is God himself.. science and man cannot give us the answers we want because it’s not man’s business to know
Please do it soon Plate Tectonics...this place in Polluted with Millionaire Liberals consuming massive amounts of Building materials for Mansions, Water for Pools, and Flying their Private Gas guzzling Jets polluting the Air...all the while spouting tired "Save the Planet " Cr*p in their Movies and at Concerts.
I'm wondering if the Navy is aware of all of this information? I have two good suggestions. Hire one of the World's Top Expert Remote Viewer's to Pinpoint all the past Seismic activities and possible Future conditions? There's Lynn Buchanan and Joe Mcmonagle bothof whom worked for the United States Army in Fort Mead Maryland. There's also The Farsight Institute Remote Viewing Team in Atlanta GA. Doctor Courtney Brown has a Team of Expert Remote Viewer's that can help this situation out in some capacity. There's a Point of Information about the Ocean beneath 4 or 5 Western States in which Submarines can go. There's an elevator in Nevada that leads down to the Ocean. How do I know this information? John Leer said so on his several YouTube videos may he rest in Peace. Hopefully you'll follow up on my advice so you'll have more to go on to be able to predict any movement or shift in the tectonic plates?
Just look at the pinnacles national monument, half of the pinnacles are in los Angeles and the other half have moved 250 miles north just south of salinas
Actually- carbon 14 is now not reliable due to natural exposure issues.
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
For these people to claim that this is the greatest fault on earth is idiotic. The subduction faults along South America and from Northern California to Alaska are far longer and have far stronger earthquakes. The rest of the Ring of Fire includes faults along the coasts of Japan, Java and Sumatra that are longer and produce much worse quakes and tsunamis. Just because it is in California, does not mean that the San Andreas is a great fault and the quakes that happen along it are not even close to being the strongest on record. The producers of the show live there, so they are totally biased.
What a disaster waiting to happen
Does anyone listen... He knows all about 20 million years ago. But  Has problem with california cause no one was here until fairly recently. What !
Cannot come soon enough.
Have another drink smoke some more crack
Going be a unprecedented disaster?  Blessings, protection removed?
You live in California make sure you have a life preserver on hand
Move from, Chicago local good 😊😊
There go,s hollywood,,,what a shame,,,,,maybe ,,the view an jimmy kimmel will no longer be,,,,theyll find away too show ,,reruns.
This song played as I crawled out of a dui crash and I crawled back in to turn up the volume.rock on.
Glad I no longer live in California.
Once my mom moves… if everyone in cali were to die the world would be a better place
Am routing for the fault...go fault break hollyfxxk off in the ocean
and thats why you will nerver see me live in LA
July 8 2022 4am
It would be good for the rest of the nation
What made the volcanoes, glaciers, or even the Earth's crust? Why are they always telling you that the Earth's formation started with  formed matter? I, I ....just think you skipped a BIG piece.
How are scientists supposed to fix this what good is it that we no this other than to alert people
I can solve this easy it went that way because it didnt want to go the other way lol jk
It is so unfortunate that most scientists don't believe in creationism. This earth as we know it won't be here in a million years or not even 50 to 100 years. Jesus Christ is coming again and this earth will be utterly destroyed at that time. These geologists can surmise all that they want with all of their abundance of scientific knowledge, but that doesn't erase the fact that all of the universe and every species of life was divinely created. It is much easier to believe in creationism than it is to believe in evolution. Evolution doesn't make sense, hence it doesn't exist.
All the focus on SA … when in the SF Bay Area there are nearly a dozen faults including the Hayward which is directly under all the civilian infrastructure, hospitals, fire departments, city halls… etc. There are no warnings when the fault slips. Remember that the World Series EQ was just 17 seconds … and did several billion dollars in damage
They must have been the first conspiracy theorists. “The 1906 earthquake was caused by the government setting off underground explosions”
Wrong
God help those in California when the big one hits 🙏  we had a little trimmer but we moved after I had 3 nights dreaming in having to crawl over rubble to get my children!!!!
We lived in Upland back in mid 80's & moved right before the 1989 big one that took the overpass pancaked we were lucky
Can't happen soon enough, IMO.  It will clean out a hive of incest, villainy and anti_America, anti_Constitution in one big Shake & Bake moment. 👍👍s & Countless ❣️s to those innocents caught up in it.
This show is so over dramatic, the citizens are in constant peril; no they’re not  They make it like the world is gonna end tomorro, this show was probably broadcast in 2010 now it’s 2022 and we’re still here and the people in Cali don’t live in constant peril 🙄 good grief Tv people will do anything for ratings
😳😳That's the crack in the earth from Stranger Things 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
That crack in the earth reminds me other episode of The Amazing World of Gumball when they saved the dinosaur girl out of the void of lost things
PLEASE stop leaving stuff in the cavity!
Awesome.
Not millions!!!
So?
I was 7 years old and in the bay area in 1989. That one was traumatic. Nothing more scary than watching the cement and blacktop on the roads ripple and roll like waves of water. It was like throwing a huge stone into a pond and watching the water, but underneath our feet!!
This natural occurrence is now called climate change. Politicians think they can fix it. Only if we give up our money and liberty.  That’s fact.
I heard of 9.2 Earth Quake coming,.west Coast from Britshish Coumbia ,  coming down all the way to California Coast, with 100 foot Sunami, they know it's coming, But when will it strike, they don't know, California Should preparing, before it Happens?
If anybody was around Los Angeles in January 1994 to experience the Northridge Earthquake then you know the terror. I was 20 years old at the time and there is no way to describe it. The sound alone as it is happening makes you beg God to make it stop. The frustrations and discomforts AFTER the event was really bad and for a long time. I pray to God this San Andres does not let loose. The world is hurting really bad with so many different things. It seems like everyday there is new gun violence and that alone is too much. God help the world heal.
And one year later..........nothing
A year later. Nothing yet.
I heard the big quake was going to hit in the 60's ? I'll believe it when it really happens
The wokest state will get a wake a real wake up message from the planet.
Experienced a couple of small quakes here on the east coast , like nothing I’ve ever experienced couldn’t fathom a big one
A Russian Astrophysics received a Noble prize for his published work on the 23,000-year orbit of the Earth.  The earth moves closer and farther away from the sun in this 23.000-year cycle.  The last ice age ended 10,000 years ago.  Based on the cycle we are moving closer to the sun. Of course, moving closer to the sun means the Climate will change.  Hate to tell you this but mankind is not responsible for climate change
Can we extend this up to drop off Portland and Seattle?
They said California was going to fall off into the ocean lol.
All you got to do is remember , GOD IS IN CONTROL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-----------Ernest E. Johnson
.i live on the fault and i never heard of any. of those towns
I live in Missouri Rt on top the new Madrid fault. We had a shake back few months ago. April/May. Sounded like loud Boom at first then house shaking for 15 seconds. It was much larger 45 miles north of poplar bluff mo. I had just left California the night before in 94 when the one hit that interstate 5 collapse. We had just drove over interstate 5 Rt were it collapsed the night before. We were headed to Pennsylvania. We miss tornados in Tulsa Oklahoma by one night and big snow storm in mountains in Pennsylvania that shut highway down for 2 days. I was long haul driver. All I can say is God had our path paved in advance for us. New Madrid fault is due to crumble anytime. You can’t run n hide tho. Natural disaster are everywhere. One does happen another will no matter where you are. Elon Tesla tunnels in California would not be a very good choice to be driving in.
Isadore is fair. I do not get as much time or attention from God and lucifer as other beings do. But- I got most of my attention from them during my actual soul creation. Isadore is fair. I do get some time, and this life, during the final battle- God and lucifer have been with me the entire time. I feel extremely loved and special.
I grow up in the Pacific Northwest and I do think that Mega quake would be one the most powerful and costliest natural disaster in modern U.S. History than San Andreas because it might gonna strike off the coast of Northern California alway up to British Columbia it would probably be 9.0 or higher
If you want to know how the Earth was made ... Read Genesis.
When the fault gives up and California falls into the ocean only then will the evil out there stop. It's not will it, it's when.
I know of a family that in 1969, I believe it was the Santa Rosa earthquake, they were terrified and left for Florida.  Soon thereafter,  a tornado destroyed their home. I had live in CA since 1969 and nothing mayor had ever happened to my family. Yes, some tremors, and in 1997 during the Northridge one our block chimney came tumbling down, but other than that.....nothing mayor.
The word Data should pronuced DAYta!
Why should I trust scientists when today they don't even know there is two genders
When you say "about", you mean years?  Asking for a friend...
hogwash when??  it is now middle 2022 and nothing yet
7.22.2022 around 3:22 pm that is when it will happen.
In 1980 I was 7 years old when I first heard about the impending San Andreas Fault about to strike. In 1990 I heard about it again. The fear of San Andreas about to strike continued on for several decades. Now, it is 2022 when I am hearing about the impending doom of the San Andreas fault about to strike. For the past 42 years (and probably longer), this impending doom is about to strike the bay area so we all better move to higher ground quickly. Thank you History Channel for warning us all before it's too late. P.S. The weather for tomorrow will be beautiful and sunny somewhere...thanks for believing.
"The San Andreas Fault: Disaster About to Strike" It's been "about to strike" for almost 50 years now. I remember when they made and I watched the movie "Earthquake" about it in 1974.
This bring down the value of house in the Bay Area than I will finally be able to buy a nice house.  Lol. These Indians and Asians are buying an $1 million house that have 2 bedrooms and 1 bath. SMH SUCKERS!!!
I'm wondering if since the lakes in California are drying up because drought could also be the fault also draining them
GETS WORSE GODS MAD AT MASONS ANTICHRIST ILLUMINATI... BELIEVE IT.
LA & San Fran are way overdue for a big one.
This is no joke. Everybody in Southern California is sitting on a  ticking time bomb. This will be a population drop of deaths. This will be bad for all. Not just California. But the whole world. Sorrow will overcome everybody. Be prepared.
Wow! How does it feel to be standing there ? Looking at the edge of the Pacific plate.
I find sea shells a lot in the az. Desert
I'd love to see a whole new beach front.
Running a large drill like that in lighting? That probably didn't happen. I mean I guess if you were to catch a driller running a rig in lighting he would be a core driller.
People through lives in CA, are crazy... Will I guess they have there death wish.. after all there just nothing but looney people there...
And this is why the Egyptians used large stones to build their homes
With a little luck.commie- fornia will slip into the ocean and we can all buy beach front property in Nevada..
I've lived along the San Andreas Fault my entire life. From Southern California, Northern California, and the Central Valley. Been thru a few of the major quakes, since 1961. The 1989 Loma Prieta Quake was the most terrifying.
How come there is no gap, ditch in the land in between the fence? Its like the land stretched
America is 2,600 miles wide. With 2.8 millions miles of gas and chemical pipeline..
The Mississippi River is also a big falt.
I finally understand why God made the oceans... The weight of the water keeps the plates down and stabilized. The hot magma is pushing up with great force.
I'm waiting patiently. Edit: Is there any way we can speed up the process?  Asking for a friend.
Suspicious Observers on earthquakes. It's the electricity STUPID. GLOBAL ELECTRIC CIRCUIT. They are driven by the sun and solar energy.
The continental plates can slip at the Low velocity zone (llsvp)  when the magnetosphere of earth is weakened. A micronova can do that. The magnetic north pole has left the arctic circle and is now off the coast of Siberia, headed for the Bay of Bengal. The South magnetic pole is no longer in Antarctica--it is headed north. If you have a compass you can compare with any landmark that shows north. My compass is now showing 60 degree deflection from true north. A few months ago it showed only a 45 degree deflection.  When I grew up, the sun was yellow all day. Now the sun is white most of the day. This last happened to earth 12,000 years ago and it is soon to happen again, in this decade or next. Micronova is a newly recognized phenomenon in current science and even some scientists have not realized this, yet. Last time Earth went through this 8/10 plants and animals became extinct. This has the power to make continents sink, rise or move about, make the waters rise, and cause many earth faults and volcanoes to erupt. The cause of the LA earthquake can be seen in the sky, when the sun turns red and then black.
It's not a matter of ( if ) in as much as it's a matter of when! Scriptures tell us that in the last days we would have many earthquakes and we are living in the last days! This is an event that will take place very soon.
Being one year later, How's that working out ?      lol
It will happen  the question  is when.
When is mankind going to wake up Atlantis another. The lizard was in all there images. Why couldn't we study evolution? They been programming us since jump. Now that giant whole doubled in 24 hours . Going to b electricity . Nobody cared bout us.only what familò
The San Andreas has nothing on New Madrid which is also overdue.
I live in the Coachella Valley, approximately 8 miles fron the mighty San Andreas fault.  We all know we are far too long over due.  There won't be any warning, so when it happens, hope for the best.  Make sure you appreciate your family and friends...cuz it could happen 10 minutes from now or in another 25 years.
Godzilla
I think "Climate change" is to blame.
Get out, now. Hebrews insist disaster... catastrophe impending
half of CA is gonna disappear real soon
Arizona Bay best thing to probably ever happened to the United States
They only have 29 years left then Because this video's already a year old
This video is over a year old and San Fran is still there . Hurry up and drop it into the sea please. .
I so glad there is Hope in Jesus Christ live or die I am with Jesus Christ
Yeah yeah yeah 😴
Oh please let California fall into the ocean the whole world would be a better place
Earth Is Stationary And Level.
When is this earthquake going to do it's job and take out the wack job liberals and PHEDOS and or just wipe it out............
It’s only under 7,000 years old. Evolution is not factual it’s only a theory or an unproven and impossible lies
They've been waving the red flag of peril for 50 years, since I was 16.  Unfortunately, my disaster came in 2003, when my house burned down.  San Diego County, Witch Creek fire.
So cali maybe an island someday huh?
Hurry up.  🤣
Since when is plate tectonics a theory? It's a FACT. CAN'T WAIT FOR this part of California to slide into the ocean; incompetent liberals who have already ruined California; an excellent demise. Now they are all moving in droves bringing their bad habits with them. When you see the animals running inland. The liberal animal must run in the opposite direction; of course they will.
Mi teclado está en español ahora, y me daña lo q escriba en inglés.
The coast can sink
SUMMARY:   California Won't Fall into the Ocean.. it will become part of Canada !!
Earth was made by God. We live in a young earth. Erosion would have logically eroded-away- what id claimed to have occured "hundreds of thousand or millions" of years ago to something else and not what it is today, thousands of years ago..
What about Cascadia ?
"Millions" and "Billions" ~>these are religious terms, expressed as if true, which they are not.  There is NO "evolution," outside of its religious nature.  They offer NO PROOF of "Millions" and "Billions." They cannot.  Its all Fruitcaky Faith kind of stuff.  And no, God did NOT use evolution.  Being God, he had no need of it, and said so: "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." ~ Genesis 2:7, KJV  Here, God does NOT say he created a living being that later became a man.  NOPE!  It DOES say God created a man which became a Living Soul. So God here declares he did NOT use Evolution. And why would he? Being God, why would he Lie about it?  He had absolutely NO NEED of it.  ***        ***        ***
You can tell this episode is out of date! Nancy Pelosi insisted that it be renamed "Trump's Fault".
A year later........ IT'S STILL THERE!
It couldn't happen to a nicer state
It happened in north and central san andreas line ran right under san Francisco soon southern san andreas line the lake and line san andreas
In "ring of fire pacific plate goes by North American plate
Observe your pets of pre quakes weather
Haven’t started to watch yet BUT 1st thing that crosses my mind seeing this title is: What would we do if/when it happened with Biden running the country. We wouldn’t have the gas/energy to help in any significant way. We wouldn’t have the supplies to help with all the manufacturing, production, & supply chain issues. We would only have bigger issues after the “event” because Biden would place Kamala in charge. She would than try to fix the problem by saying “We need to work together” until their both replaced come 2024.  Now, on to the show. I just had to get that off my chest.  Many Blessings All 🙏🇺🇸💪
There is also a fault that runs thru the south and on into N Y.
We're so long overdue for a big quake & as I believe we're in the "Last Days", God help us.
There is a college , limestone college, is on top of a Huge limestone quarry, with much limestone  taken out over years! Is limestone a prerequisite  for fault lines such as in California? This college  is in Gaffney,  South Carolina,  29340!
My question is so adding weight on the fault lines like homes buildings businesses roads ext is it going to stop the plates from shifting or is it going to put it under a lot more pressure and start making other fault lines move or one big boom
yep and we can not wait to see.  i have ocean front property
I can’t , because the narrator sounds like he’s acting like a narrator.  🙄 I just can’t. 😳
Californias are overrated 😂
If they just dug deep enough, they could find and remove the fault before the next Earthquake. 😁
This was a good documentary. Now heading over to  Movie Central to watch San Andreas Quake.
And they want to build a high speed train running parallel to the fault.  Brilliant.
California is spending billlions on a kamikaze train.  Already millions spent.  And dont have half the right of way bought yet. No one will be left to use it by the time they finish it.
Circular reasoning is ridiculous. The earth with rivers, trees animals, and people,  is only approximately 6,000 yrs old. Prior it was void without form.
"Millions," eh? Shows your religion right upfront. Your religion is evolution. No one was around to verify your "Millions." No verification.
Balls people. It is not the molecular structure of carbon-14 that makes it radioactive. It is the nuclear structure that makes it radioactive.
Excuse me? Ugly scar on the landscape? It’s not lying in wait to ruin the CA cities, it was here first. No one forced people to build on unstable ground. I thought this might be interesting, but clearly I should have known better.
I'll hold my breath lol
If you make fun of people living in Florida and Oklahoma for obvious reasons. California is literally the real ticking time bomb…
1952 my brother and I were in bed and I woke on the other side of the room with my back against the wall  I looked at my brother Jerry and said why did you do that as he was sitting up bed saying I did not that as the bed on wheels came rolling to me then heard on the Radio it was north of Bakersfield Ca. on the Tehachapi hills . In Los Angeles hardly any body felt We lived in Highland park a town part of the  city
Would anyone actually miss California if it sank into Ocean lol
Sn Andrés is under control no problem
Don’t worry the fault of san Andrés is now stoped no problem whit earthquakes you will see.
Yawn
STOP BUILDING  HIGH OR TALL BUILDINGS  ,,  THOSE  ARE  DEATH  TRAPS !!!!!!!!!!!
MY QUESTION'S ARE ,,, # 1    WHY REBUILD THERE AGAIN ,, # 2  WHY DID OUR GOVERNMENT  LET  THE  REBUILDING  ON  A  FAULT ZONE KNOWING  IT  IS  GOING  TO  HAPPEN  AGAIN  AND  AGAIN  ????????????????????????????????  STUPIDITY !!!!!!!!!!!
Pure nonsense. Fabricated for you so you don't think.
"LEARN TO SWIM" See you down in Arizona Bay!
People in los angeles could care less if they die 😄🙃
As long as quake takes out Newsome and Pelosi I'm okay with it
I won't miss the craziness coming out of the west coast. Bye
The big one is coming.  😳
Can a non-slippery liquid material be made and put into the ground to stop the shifting of the plates and preventing earthquakes?
If the San Andreas fault and the Yellowstone eruption happen at roughly the same time, that would be a major catastrophe for all of the Americas!
Sitting here. Watching this. Wondering how the people who hate America but live in and benefit from this nation are going to blame this on president Trump.
oh my god Hearing Arlnold Schwarzenegger's voice threw me off for a second
Plate tectonics has never been what it's cracked up to be 😀
Reread the story of The Three Little pigs and where and how they built their house
If everybody meets at the fault and starts jumping up and down maybe we'll get lucky in California will break off and float away.. 😀
"every couple decades or so"
Will the nukes cause this quake like the Fukushima earthquake?  Comin man everybody knows how Fukushima broke!
We've advanced scientifically because......we questioned science. Dogma is isn't science. We should constantly question science. It's not a religion or even world view. Think about it. When questions are met with cynisism or dogma, think about it.
16:59 What sorcery is this! Alien technology? One day we'll go to space!!
El Cambio climático en otros países y la placa q golpea (pacífico) a la placa estadounidense (america) en  Los Angeles, puede ser directamente uno de los efectos que esta afectando mas.  Esa roca se comporta como un magma q cambia lento y que está activo.  La calificaría como Magma pasivo.  Es de una rara composición fisica.  Por ahi puede salir algo (por ejemplo; agua).  Leí a un minero q encontro conchas actuales. See also how the Earth was made (Firering) to understand how it is Works. Im marta a technology student.
La TIERRA about the gas explotations, it has been exploted, Yes 'OR, not.  Too many years was happened.  (I practice some english)
The 🌎 is NOT 🚫 4.5 billion years old!  More of Darwin's evolutionary 🐂💩!  It's no wonder we are graduating college educated idiots.
The entire west cost needs to sink and take every white liberal along with it!
Big earthquakes are never fun, but the smaller ones are kind of fun!
The last time that I felt an earthquake on the San Andreas fault was back in 1989 and that was a pretty strong quake too and it did a lot of damage as well!
14:03 "Hudnuts"........😂
All we can do is pray that California breaks off and it slides into the sea 🙏
REMBER ERIC HOLDER, OBAHMAS ATTY. GENERAL, IGNORING A CONGRESSIONAL SUBPENA, OVER "FAST & FURIOUS"??? AGREE WITH DAVE 100% ON ASHLIE BABBOTT SHOOTING.
We certainly hope soon!
We had an earthquake in Arkansas like five or 10 years ago 10 years ago I've never been in one but I knew what it was
It's not just in California I had a dream Arkansas River being drained earthquake crack what side of the wall of water is higher than the other I've never seen a movie like this in my dream water is Flowing from both directions into the crack one side of the water is 12 to 15 feet higher than the other side the Arkansas River will be drained no more water dreamed 15 years to 20 years ago people were hiding from what I don't know I want to say lost we're trying to pay attention to so much things in the dream a lot was going on all at once it was hard to take it in and it hasn't even happened yet
I would be moving away from there if I lived there. ASAP
I’m hoping it hits soon. Cali is a toilet, it needs to be flushed.
I was there When the Freeway fail From Oakland People were robbing people even from the dead
This would be the best thing to happen in the US right now.....I hope it swallows LA
I found this to be fascinating to me   thankyou
California just needs to break off and float away.
I feel like the earth feels the need to shake off anything it don't want on it, like a dog shakes when it's wet.
Still waiting for CA to fall off into the ocean...
Invest in land on east side of fault, it'll  be ocean front property.
Fascinating Geology!
California is in for an earthquake like you wouldn't believe and sorry it's about every 25 years I don't control Mother Earth you can just figure it out yourself
I'm a Californan who married Texas man.  Your safer here and they don't Charge Rent like New York.  My old state Taxes FOOD.  Texas doesn't. Nor state tax returns.  God Bless all af you.
The Earth was created a little over 6,000 years ago by our creator so where does mankind come up with thousands of millions of years ago😂😂😂
I've been in California during an earthquake and in Greece. It's very scary and unforgetable. Now I live in Colorado.
Hey I have a brillant idea that I think  EVERYBODY will love!! In my best Stewie voice.  Let's build mega cities with spawling towns directly atop the largest and very active fault-line on the planet!!  Then, when an earthquake happens we can all act surprised!!!  Yay!!!  BRILLIANT!!!!
Carbon dating isn't reliable. Not at all.
Thats just natural Democrat Activity
Earthquakes are not difficult to forecast.  The USGS CONTINUES teaching false data.
They been promising for years that evil cesspool would fall into the ocean. Well.... we're waiting and need it now
The sooner , the better.
Holister has had earthquakes.  I lived in that town and there  were recorded over  100 earthshakings a year.  I  don't  know what it is now.
I believe that because of how EVIL California has become (especially in the last 20 years) that God will create a massive earthquake that will not only destroy California, but it will also kill a majority of EVIL DEMONIC PEOPLE!
I'm pausing this video just after the intro to say... Isn't it amazing how karmic justice works. There isn't a better state in the Union to fall off into the ocean. Live an immoral, Godless life and reap the far reaching just desserts. It's a pity that so many innocents will be swept away in wrath meant to punish the wicked among them.
Marin County is pronounced MARE-in, not MAR-in.
Okay, I have a genuine question. I live in Philly so forgive my ignorance. I understand the warnings, but short of moving from the area, what exactly can really be done? The quakes cannot be prevented and there's only so much that can be done to secure a building in the hope that it would survive - not including the Leaning Millennium Tower of San Francisco. I think I'd have too much anxiety to live in a place where a subway train could be swallowed by the earth.
Ok by
Just waiting for God's wrath Look out!
Eventually, the San Andreas fault will produce an earthquake.  It's been predicted for decades.  We just don't know when.  It's impossible to predict.  Maybe today.  Maybe in 100 years.  So when you live in California, you go about your life without dwelling on when an earthquake will hit.  If you live long enough, you'll probably feel the earth move under your feet, at least once.
TALC is the answer to preventing earthquakes.       Wow, that's an amazing discovery.  This guys are awesome.
Trump did that.come on man.
Sometimes God sends people a wake up call! They usually don’t answer!
Given what is happening there it may be divine wrath.
This big one is long over due to hit the west coast.
Kinda wished California would drift off.
Nah its not you and history is getting harder and also more interesting how these videos are more intense and more  explainable also
I'm just waiting for L.A. to fall into the sea. 😊
Thanks for reminding  me  of the possibilities.  The big question is: When? followed by the question: Will we be prepared? God bless California!
THE WRATH OF GOD WILL PUNISH THE LIBERALS.
Lookout Hollywood you're time is almost up.
Maybe California will become it's own island and become a country. What a blessing that would be.
Only the super smart live in California!!!!   lmao
How do you spell “fear mongering”
And also think about all the Millions of immigrants that comes in since the border is Open it is projected in California or Florida and look at the space that people is trying to live that but it also says in the Bible 2/3 a million of people will die before God and Jesus return
Read the Bible someday there will not be California or Florida
The conclusion is people are idiots- rebuilding in the SAME place the 1906 quake destroyed, and then naivly thinking all those massive skyscrapers are somehow going to stand up, and now there's 11 MILLION people living there, when the water, electric is cut off, and gas lines break and fires and explosions start there will be no stopping it
It is what is going to save the USA from California.
If we're lucky California will detach from the mainland and crumble into the sea!!!!!!!!
11/23/25  🙏
California could not be a better place for a fault line,Just think about the Loser Politicians that would be taken care of for THERE misdeeds all in one shot,Hopefully,PEOSI'S,SCHIF,NEWSOME,,FEINSTIEN,GASCON,AND ALL THE OTHER SCUM RUINING OUR COUNTRY HOMES ARE RIGHT ON THAT LINE,OR ATLEAST STRIKING DISTANCE
Sounds like this Ahab and Donald Trump have a lot in common
Never mind the San Andreas Fault you should worry about The  Puente Hills Fault
"They" forgot to tell us about the blind thrust faults going thru the middle of LA.
All you have to do to understand is look at the baja CA peninsula   sea of cortez that's where California is gonna be
Dude jump out there and grab those mushrooms 😜😹
I live in Oakland CA... an we hear weird things sometimes here... like gigantic things being dropped or metal slamming into metal at a very high speed... it literally sounds like some sort of explosion. We thought they were blowing things up underground...
Couldn't happen to a more arrogant people.
I have earthquake insurance. An extra expense but having it absolutely helped my parents rebuild in NorCal after the ‘89 quake, even with a high deductible. Back then the payout was around $80K, enough to cover all the repairs. Also improved the house and made it more earthquake resilient and  valuable.
Can we speed that L.A. to Frisco thing up and put all  the trash in one place?
My question would be that if a major tsunami were to hit along the west coast could the weight on the sebuction plate cause a series of earthquakes along the fault simultaneously?
Globetards.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The earth was created by HaShem
Wow I heard about the fault line as I can remember still has not happened yet
It wasn’t even 1919 yet
There is a lot of history on the West Coast. We need to investigate the value of what is above and below this land. Maybe it's a curse because of how humans try to selfishly acquire land from others. The land honestly belongs to no one. We all need to take care of it. The devine owns it. All I know is I'll help take care not disrespect it by no means
As a concerned oregon resident trying to do my part what can I do to speed up and/or intensify this quake. I'd like to start as soon as the oregon border wall is completed.
Hope it happens before I die. Really wanna see that 🤔.
nobody cares if California falls off the face of the earth. atleast I dont.
They'll blame trump...
What's up with the Richard Dreyfus photo bomb at 1:35 lol
Why are there so many earthquakes in California? Because it is Andrea's fault.
Oh it was 12 billion years ago.  Pick a number.  The great earthquake California will come on November 12, 2023.
so let me ask this question okay and I understand this video is a year old. you're saying a sonic boom can basically cause the San Andreas to go off. what if there is a nuclear explosion like somebody was to test another nuclear weapon even though I know we don't do that anymore but what if something like that happened or per se China or North Korea hit us with an ICBM. wouldn't that even be more destructive than a Sonic boom. to me that would cause a catastrophe earthquake. I don't believe anybody has thought about what I have just said nor have I ever heard anybody talk about it. and what made me come up with this is when you just talked about the sonic boom so why wouldn't a atomic explosion cause even more catastrophic damage as far as causing an earthquake on the San Andreas fault I'd appreciate it if somebody could answer that for me
how to know the earth had 4.5 billion year ? guest ?
I wouldn't live in CA because of political idiots
Me: why don’t people start to move instead of living on TOP of one of if not the most dangerous fault line on the planet ?  People of LA: your stupid why would we don’t that? Me : I dunno maybe something bad coming? People of LA: wow this is a good show !!! Me: ok you get what you ask for when it comes😉
Everyone knows what and when it's suppose to happen. And yet nothing yet. I remember when there was a a person that stated the world was going to end. And it did. He died a day later..
The Earth is NOT. BAZILLIONS OF YEARS OLD, FOLKS.
Theory of plate tectonics -is not an absolute hence the word theory. Seismographs have never saved one human life from earthquakes
Put some Neosporin and a bandaid on that thing.
The politicians of California aren't interested in real problems those with low probability and high consequence. California politicians are interested in theoretical problems of their religions of Global Warming. -- Critical Race Theory that's how they get elected.
I once took a geology class and we followed the San Andreas fault from San Juan Bautista and the Mission there all the way up to Pt. Reyes and Olema where you can straddle the two Continental plates.  It was fascinating.  At the Mission we could see the earliest seismograph and the  spiky lines that recorded the 1906 earthquake. Later I went through the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco.If my husband had not changed his day off to Tuesday the week before the earthquake, he would have been driving the Airport van that picked up a woman and her child and would have been on the I-880 double-decker freeway that pancaked,crushing the airport van to 18 inches high, killing all within.If my son had not decided to stay home that day he could have been working at Candlestick Park at Game Three of the World Series, when n overhanging block of cement fell, possibly could have crushed him.  Earthquakes are all too real here.
Say you purchased the land where the fault is. Would it then be your fault ?
Always have decent boots available just in case you survive the big one. Surviving the aftermath is the trick.
do people actually watch this it their free time? I’m doing this for an assignment.
I wish this would happen.  the country would improve massively if that piece just floated off and sank deep into the ocean.
Carbon dating isn’t very reliable
As someone who has grown up here in the San Francisco  Bay Area for most of her childhood,  I'm USED TO LIVING WITH THE EARTHQUAKES...one can SLEEP through an earthquake,  BUT I GUARANTEE YOU GUYS That one can not sleep through a tornado, volcanic eruption,  or a hurricane! I'd prefer to deal with EARTHQUAKES (YES, I've been through dealing with a tornado and a hurricane...)!
West SF, aka LA
Class work 3
God finna destroy L.A. is the most brutal way possible
The earth was changed by the great flood
At 30:47 the guy looks like mr bean
LA is toast!  😖
I'll take our tornadoes. There are warnings. Earthquake, no thanks.
California is literally trying to kill you.
God, will let you know, what his plans are
Learn to Swim!
So every time it happens those cities have to rebuild and adapt to the new faults. Wow
89 was  a  wake up call. And  people  forgot and moved on.
Honestly,  I'd prefer Earthquakes (when it comes to natural disasters) compared to like tornadoes and hurricanes...cuz one CAN SLEEP through an earthquake....u CAN'T SLEEP through a tornado....and, yes, I'm living in the San Francisco Bay Area; have been since I was a kid! I was here during the Loma Prieta Earthquake,  I wound up with a head injury due to a heavy lamp falling on my head during the quake, waking me up from a cat nap!
Humans shouldn't live on any coasts, faults, volcanoes, mountains etc. Lmao.
I hope it doesnt happen 😱
Nobody knows when the fault will rumble. Hopefully sooner than later and make sure pelosi  schiff and schumer are visiting when her million dollar house collapses on them
The dinosaurs died off in the flood.
And they’ll save everyone in CA using electric cars/trucks, earth movers, hand held tools and saws, pumps, etc.
"Disaster about to strike"... One year later and the only Disaster that struck are liberals and their idiotic leader, Biden the Brandon
I live near the fault line and I cross it every day to get to work. My worst nightmare is that it happens and I can't get back home to my family.
Would the ocean water fall in the open vaults
Fantastic but what will happen to San jose ca
115 AD.
I was a miner working in the tunnel, for piping water from Northern California, to Los Angeles. We were about six miles in, of 12 miles, we hit very soft earth, our tunnel caved in, it took about two weeks to shore it up so, we could get back on track. I found myself standing in wet sand, I got down for a closer look, I found sand that was once a beach, there was even sea shells there that looked like they were picked up off the beach that day. For some reason we were following the Andreas fault. It made me realize how fresh the mountains were shaped. I took some of the sea shells home in my lunchbox. They were so ordinary, people wouldn’t have believed where they came from.
There are worse earthquakes that could happen in California. Their recurrence rate is on the order of a thousand plus years, so they ignore them in favor of focusing on the San Andreas Fault that reoccurs every 100-150 years. But there are blind thrust faults buried under Los Angeles that let lose with quakes just as large directly underneath the Los Angeles metropolitan area and they don’t really know when those quakes will reoccur. When they do, it’ll be worse than the San Andreas on the other side of the mountains letting lose. It’s the faults they don’t know about that we need to worry about. Just look at the quakes on fault they either didn’t know existed or thought were harmless? Sylmar,Kern county 1952,Northridge, Whittier etc, etc.
I am still waiting for the big one that finally cracks that shithole off the continent, and finally gives back some electoral votes.
DAM faults  if its not this fault its another oh well next time be right!
URGENT!!!  URGENT!!! URGENT!!!                                                                                                     THE BIG ONE IS COMING 05/22/2022!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope all the politicians are in California when it happens 👍🇺🇸
Uh isn’t the greatest fault the one in Chile?
This is a top notch documentary
Years ago I heard an earthquake engineer say, "earthquakes don't kill people....buildings do".
No they didn't we were made slaves
Just End this World 🌎 Already , Who really cares anymore 😕
The sooner the better
two places they could hit san Andreas fault and yellow stone caldera
And when it happens the Looney Left will expect the people who had the sense NOT to live there pay.
Does the deterioration of rock have anything to do with pollution. Does the chemicals in bombs and in nuclear atmospheres affect the oceans condition thereby affecting the plaques of earths stones.
Has the distance of where the San Andreas falk started to where the falk ends ever been measured. If yes can you tell how far an active earthquake can continue on, if the shifting of rock is happening continuously?
Kalifornia Isle, has a nice ring to it!
Hope level's California
We need to do away with politicians !!  Just sayin
I lived in Hollister (San Benito County, California) for over 15 years. And, I laughed at his comment saying Hollister does not have earthquakes.  There are two well-known faults that goes through town; the San Andreas and the Calaveras faults.  I have felt my share of earthquakes, tremors and after-shocks.
Fake news ….MAGA NATION BABY LETS GOOOOO TRUMPS UR FATHER
The Hayward default hasn't erupted in 150 years its capability is 7.0 or more
Some areas of land are just not fit to build upon , should be band . Go figure !
BS no earthquake is coming
Liberal elected put the fault way down the list of danger
My gut feeling is that it's coming very soon......-__-
I had moved to SoCal a few months after the Northridge Quake. They had a mild, rolling aftershock that made the room sway. After that, I didn't hang pictures on the wall for three years. I did get used to the lively nature of the earth, though. My office chair would roll on the chairmat or boogie every now and then--didn't bother me at all. We had one "bang" quake. I woke up, thinking a car or truck had crashed into our duplex.  Eventually (not due to earthquakes), I moved to another state.
Why don’t they just go ahead and develop it and get it over with!
Lies lies they just want everyone  to get out of California
I would have no problem with democrat-run California being wiped out
The Loma Prieta quake was on a different fault
🕊🕊🕊
I thought Yellowstone was the most dangerous.
Ohio is pretty active along the mountain range.
How old is this cause Coachella had a few earthquakes three or four years ago.
4.5 BILLION years old ....  You will never get a single stitch of proof out of them though !   The earth is just over 6,000 years old ,  And there's proof to back this age up !!!
Boring! Tell me something that I don't already know
The rest of the country is hoping the entire West coast slides into the ocean very soon.
I think that after the next super earthquake , That southern California will become an  island again,when the land deflates.
Wouldn't be such a bad thing for Hollywood, maybe they should film it.
With recent volcanic activity lately I predict California to fall into OP.
Amazing how much faith people have in scientists.But love to deny the Creator of creation. Isaiah 40: God who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, Measured heaven with a span And calculated the dust of the earth in a measure? Weighed the mountains in scales And the hills in a balance?  Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done, Saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, And I will do all My pleasure,’
I love this program!
The History Channel is owned by Hearst and Disney. So yeah. It's 90% b.s.
Growing up in Calif I’ve have experience earthquakes there really weird to be standing and feel the earth below your feet move. In 1955 I was only 5 my mom said the side walks just rolled up and down of course I guess I sleep threw it while in a crib that was in North Hollywood,CA
Sorry unthinkable slaughter you live on the coast of Oregon!!👁🌀👁 and on the pacific coast
I’m a New Englander. No way would I ever live on top of a known major fault line. This is just crazy. Hope you all know what your doing.
30:00
Sir Pentinite. He was one of the knights on Arthur's quest for the holy grail, no???
Nukes are coming.
With the arrival of the woke narrative, this tragic occurrence might inherently timely.!!!!!
Well done as usual. Subscribed
I love the history of earthquakes  It so fasanating.
Couldn't pick q better place for it to start
They’ve been talking about The Big One for 60 years. Get it over with.
Poor mister hugnut
That would be awesome if California broke off and sunk into the ocean with all those liberals and drug addicts 😝
LASTLY, I FORGET WHAT YEAR (2009-2014???) A TEST HOLE WAS DRILLED IN THE CAJON PASS AREA TO SET UP A LAZER TO RECORD MOVEMENT...NO MORE THAN 6 MONTHS OF DRILLING IT WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH MOVEMENT IN EARTH TO MAKE A LAZER EFFECTIVE IN RECORDING MOVEMENTS...
1st off...THERE IS NO PROOF OF EVOLUTION...NONE!!! WE ARE CLOSE TO THE END OF 6,000 YEARS...6775(not accurate...but closer in recorded history!!!)
i dont know if CA falling into the ocean will be a disaster
Scary, what ever happens in California will have major consequences to the rest of the country. I hope and pray that it wont be as severe as the scientist are predicting.
Too much advertising
I was there when the big one hit in 89....quite the quake...
now I want to visit San Fran & LA, before they go away
One question why if you know it is coming continue to build on top of a power keg
As the world changes So do the days of our lives.  Scary New tomorrow
It was made by God!  Sorry
My land property might become a beachfront property.
I believe California state is basically made up of sand with dirt on top of it
Okay so they have been saying San Andreas fault was going to bust the west side of California off into the ocean for years. There’s earthquakes all the time from it. Lol 😂
These documentaries would be so much better without all the annoying apocalyptic music.
It sounds like the San Andreas fault will take care of the homeless population in Los Angeles I think if I was one of them on skid road I'd find a new city to sleep in
Its a year later. 2022. San Andrea's fault line still quiet.
We should hope the fault collapses. End the California drag on our federal dollars. An act of God it would be, anyway, correct? We are a capitalist country are we not? Few gain what many lose, no?
Dems: “Can we tax the faultline??”
Hudnuts?
An earthquake can happen at anytime. It can stretch as far as Connecticut because I know my garage apartment sits on part of this vault.
I think that thunder and lightning storm might have been God telling you to stop messing around that he has plans and he doesn't want you upsetting them
Hopefully California and all the Democrats fall into the ocean.
Check the Book of Genesis about in the Bible tells you all about Earth being created
It's absolutely amazing how much they lie to everyone . If you don't see it with your own eyes. Don't believe it . People don't let me down. Don't let yourselves down. Peace
This film is sponsored by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. The cold may be a shock but not like that🤣🤣🤣🤣
They have been saying that for over 75 years and I have lived here all my life. All fear mongering
Californians from the comments are not alarmed and the buildings in the video doesn't relate concern
I had one tremor experience.    When I lived in Louisville Kentucky.   Scary.  The chair I was sitting in walked across the floor.
Jesus is the only way humbly ask him he will answer
The Juan de Fuca dwarfs the San Andreas Fault. Check it out
What happens when Cali snaps off right at the fault line? Just curious 😁 There's going to be a LOT less people moving to My neck of the woods!
Did you know that Calif was originally & Island
Hope California falls in the ocean.
Wholly cow..then Cali turns deep Red if the coastal cities slide into the Pacific
The San Andreas fault is capable of causing a disaster of a magnitude unprecedented in US history. No doubt. I was in the Loma Prieta quake. It was terrifying. And that was far from the worst it could do. But the most dangerous geologic feature on Earth? No, that is hyperbole. The Cascadia Subduction zone is capable of creating a magnitude 11 earthquake that would potentially cause complete destruction all the way from San Francisco to Vancouver, levelling the cities of Portland and Seattle as well. And the Yellowstone Super Volcano could wipe out the entire country and cause sunlight to be blacked for years. It would be a global catastrophe, with famine and disease. So the Earth is capable of far worse than just the San Andreas.
Here in the San Fernando valley we like our weekends shaken, not stirred
I love history.  It makes me feel better than everyone
A thousand years from now they'll be videos on how san Andreas is about to strike.
If you were not on the earth, when it was made, then how do you know how it was made ?
I know how the earth was made it was made be almighty God read Genesis and it will tell you.
Knowing this information I can't help but feel people are fools to live there for any reason. Even if you are not effected by the earthquake, you will pay high taxes after the government takes money from every state to pay for distruction. Doesn't seem worth it to live there.
We can only hope
A 40 METER tsunami has a very-needed cleansing affect.
Serpentine  slippery see snake in this?
I found the Talcum Rock and fault line tension interesting. I’ve only experienced small tremors here in the Midwest, a big one would be terrifying
I've been hearing this for years!
Pray when it happens nancy Pelosi is in the tallest building 🙏
Can't wait for the big one.  I mean "THE BIG ONE"!!!  Turn that Leftist enclave into the cesspool it should be.
The last one in LA, the asphalt move like ocean wave! And it was small. You ask yourself how something hard move like a liquid? Scary 😧
Over dramatic
Living in L.A. I noticed that most freeways are basically long bridges and ramps in the air, they not on the ground like in most other places... So if and when a major earthquake happens, the last place you want to be is on the freeway cause if they collapse, major destruction...RIP to those on it and under it
my teacher making me watch this for school omg im not watching this im gonna cry  🧔‍♀
I heard a rumor that a quick land movement caused James Dean's death as he was speeding thru Hollister in 1955. Can someone confirm or deny that for me, please?  Please obey proper traffic laws and regulations because the life you save may be mine. Thank you.
Cali needs to be cleaned up anyways
Someday we will lose the liberal cesspool.   And this is bad?
And yet rapture could happen at any moment...Get yourself right with the Lord, man and this world will let you down.
Blessings From Texas🤠
John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes John Holmes
Cut all their funds
Us Floridians, hope California earthquake pushes us up farther  from see level.
The warning signs are when the sultan sea gets multiple quakes...  keep an eye on them and that can be the warming shackes
The earth is mighty and very unpredictable pray that God will bless those people that are living in accordance to your law..
About to strike?  About as in a million years or in a few days?  About is relative....  I live less than 5 miles from the fault line.  A few times a week, or sometimes a few times daily, if you check the Richter scale, we experience some kind of earth movement or mini earthquake.  Your title is very misleading. If you consider micro mini earth movement as the strike, we have it quite a few times every week regularly already.  If you mean major >8 earthquakes, then about as in the next few days or 10 million years from now?
Father God I ask that you clear people out first especially my bloodline. In the name of Yeshua. Amen
My FAVORITE sports team ...The San Andreas Faults!!! GO SAF!!!
The Bible tells how the Earth was made and how old it is.
Spent six months in Lemoore. The entire time I was there, the earth never stopped shaking. We soon learned to ignore it until it hit around 2.0.
Moral of the story : Move!
What a bunch of nothing but theories!   Dates and guesses about how the earth moves are only that "theories & guesses".     Carbon dating has been absolutely shown faulty too many times to be trusted at all.
It's been a year, still waiting,   where's the BIG ONE??
I believe the more little earth quakes release tension to avoid the BIG ONE
sitting under bridge at stop light a quake happen everyone in their car got out and ran
for once a story not about Trump
Everyone talks about the big one the big one. So if y’all know so much about the big one then when is it happening. Don’t asume there’s a big one on its way. We had 2 big quakes the same Francisco and the northridge one. How about if one those 2 was the big one. Why everyone always thinking it’s going to be an 8 or greater magnitude. Only god can predict. What y’all doing is just inputting fear and the possibility of a big earthquake. All that tells me that it’s could be a man made quake and that y’all going to say you see we told y’all the big one was asleep and it decided to awake. So please shut up already about this myth of a big quake
There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.  Or ya'll can repent and he'll heal your land.
🙏Hi friends I have videos on the Rapture, Bible Prophecy and the end times. Please go to Papa Joe Fortner or shockwaves of the end times or The watchmen series with papa joe. Thank you and God bless you 🙏
Too bad the fault line doesn't run through the California State House and Gov's mansion.
How about right now?
yes! let it happened in a blue democrat state of california! enough these idiot democrats always voting for corrupt democrats in office and look a disastrious poor california suffering! stop voting for democrats !
8:33 Imagine living in 1 of those houses later in the back of the shot
The Bible says the worse earthquake ever will happen after the rapture (catching away) of the church, 7 years after will be the most horrible destruction ever on earth.  everyone who trusts The Lord Jesus as Savior will be saved.  Believe First Corinthians 15:1-4 and you can be saved from that terrible time.  I can tell people in CA how to know when the terrible earthquakes will happen.  I will give you the names of 2 Christian pastors in CA, David Jeremiah and John MacArthur, when they suddenly disappear, the time of the end has come, the worse earthquake is in the last 7 years after Christians are taken.
So very glad we moved out of California, been through enough of them to get smart and leave!
folks keep an eyeball on that Garland fault it had three small 2.0+ trimmers in last couple months.
I hope conservatives have moved away, and the woke trash move in.
imagine standing in the epicenter when it happened
Los Angeles and San Diego will be rapidly accreted down underneath to never be seen again. I see some positive aspects here
I say 2027 will be the big one to hit southern calif and all the way up to san fran
Can the whole state go too?? Please
Glad I am on the east coast.
Is so amazing that 99% of people believe in such big liars how do these scientists knows about millions and millions of year back on history when we can’t even explore our earth completely yet
The Democrats are more of a threat and have done 10x damage that any earthquake could do to California
About to strike? There is no way to tell that in human time scales. Can anyone say... click bait?
And 1 year later …… NOTHING
It's someone else's fault.
Neil Peart said In Traveling Music book that Los Angeles Will be were San Francisco is Now RIP Neil
San Andreas goes off like they think it will, L.A. will just kiss itself goodbye. Emergency services doesn't stand a snowball's chance of dealing with the aftermath. Nobody's looking at the destruction caused by ruptured utility lines. Or all that population swarming about--undoubtedly shooting and looting for all it's worth every second.
That was when you put your chocolate in my peanut butter, tectonically speaking, of course.
Wish it would hurry up and let Ca fall into the ocean.
Hundreds of millions of years????? Please stop it
The solution is, controlled fault adjustments...frequency emitters along the fault tuned to allow smaller, controlled shifts resulting in much smaller quakes.
it's goning to make Las Vegas area ocean front as Calif goes into the sea. I was born and raised in the San Francisco bay Area, in Alameda and went through a bunch of shakers in my life and was told by my Grandfather the story of the events of the early 1900's and that in the future it would be really bad. 1906 was a wakeup call for California people.
Havent we heard this b4? Just wait on indonesian land fall thats long overdue!
Please God send it to the seas....
San Francisco in the 1800s was a city built of brick very few, if any buildings were reinforced with steel structures. It was a disaster compounded by design and later fire.
Maybe California will fall off in the ocean
I felt a slight tremor once . It was enough for me to stay back East ! Earthquakes verify just how fragile life is. I hope Californians are safe.🥰👍🏽
People who live in tornado country or hurricane country can't understand why anyone would live in earthquake country.  Unlike the former, earthquakes are not a regular seasonal occurrence.   One big one per century is not a bad risk.  And earthquakes are more localized than hurricanes. NB: The scenes from 2:54 to 3:10 were not filmed during the earthquake: they are of the demolition of the damaged St. Patrick's Church on Mission Street on 9 May 1906, three weeks after the quake.  Included in this doc for dramatic effect, of course.
does the temperature slowly rise and fall before and after earthquakes at the fault
Another extremely dangerous area is the Cascade Subduction Zone right off the coast of Oregon, Washington area. An earthquake here would cause massive tsunami possibly wiping out thousands of buildings and killing thousands of people.
That created embankment*
I wonder if God really does hate fruits and liberals... lmfao
Arnold is a Gurlie man...lmfao
A billion years old and we haven’t been to the heavens  in our host form lol 😂
Lol lol. Earth is not 4. 5 billion years old. If it were our magnetic field would not be as active as it is now. We have a much younger Earth. And the Bible supports that.
Please hurry up and send California out to sea.
No way I live in California even if you gave me a place.  A wealthy friend of mine just left there for Nevada.  Smart move!
From Alaska south through Canada , Washington state, Oregon, California, into western Mexico
7:18 - Those earthquakes sure make a funny sound.
Wow- people build houses on top of the  San Andreas Fault line?
I hope California falls in the ocean with Nancy Pelosi!
Have heard this since 1976....
If I lived in California I would be packing up an leaving to much information on a pending disaster
As bad as these disasters were, they'll never top the currently disaster known as nancy pelosi.
I wonder will the land keep moving around or sink into the ocean???
I see nobody likes the truth!
Earth for christians is about 11000 years old . This is the time of the great flood of NOAH. Its in all of the ROCK STRATA as a continuous event. Don't let them fool us. whoever them is. Phrase GOD.
We are headed to the Genesis-Apocalypse moment in 2022.  So there will be outgassing before the big one and then the Pacific Rim of Fire will unzip counterclockwise.  When the Queen Charlotte Islands get it ... think about heading to Las Vegas unless you have a surfboard!
I would put more into Yellowstone National Park. It is a big  volcano which people are ignoring.
The drum 🥁 rolls🙄
I wonder might it be a means through which the ALMIGHTY employs such a destructive force to warn the nation. Whew!!! Quite a sobering thought - the St. Andrea's Fault gives way. Perhaps sooner than later.
How was the Earth formed? Your version is missing a few things… Genesis 1 King James Version 1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.  14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Outstanding Info-Share!! Have you shared this with the State of California - Earthquake Readiness / Disaster Preparedness-First Responder Committees.  When Schwarzenegger was Governor, there were readiness awareness earthquake kit instructions/public announcements etc.  however, what you have described is critical thinking which should become part of the overall States Readiness program too!    Thank you for this!
I hope all of California's politicians are dropped into the deepest crevice, when that fault finally goes all the way. They are causing so much detriment to the country. Everyone would say "good riddance to bad rubbish".
Like MANY, New Orleans, citizens, when Katrina hit October 2005, many of its residents DID NOT TAKE THE WARNING SERIOUS ENOUGH AND DECIDED TO WAIT IT OUT only to their peril. Sort of like many people  didn't get on Noah's Ark, because  it had NEVER rained before.    MANY Calipornia residents will have the same Sydrone known as, the, "NORMALCY BIAS,' simply described as, the people  simply believe, "It will never happen, to them because its been told us many, many times and never happened." The same is happening now with people today saying, "WHERE is His, (Jesus), coming. Its been for ever and things are the same since the beginning." This phenomenon was told two thousand years ago as, I  Perter 3:3-4 clearly applies to all the above. Everything will be like it was, it'll NEVER HAPPEN to us they've  been saying the same thing for EVER.   THEN HE COMES AND THEIR, LEFT BEHIND."  DONT GET the Normalcy Bias, syndrone. Get ready , get ready. Get RAPTURE READY, ACCEPT JESUS AS YOUR  SAVIOR.  AMEN
living in sf, this is a chronic fear!
Imagine overpaying to live anywhere relevantly near the San Andreas fault, while being governed by the biggest group of clowns west of Texas lmao. California 🙌🏽
Very interesting information.
Im wondering, if , when the BIG ONE- does hit, could it also initiate other things like the Cascadia subduction and the numerous volcanoes- and Yellowstone??
One thing we know for sure, is that we don't know nothing about the future
That's what happens when you live on a dust Speck circling a Star
If they can manage their science of the sun , the sun is the precursor of earthquakes, therefore earthquake prediction
How long till Cali gets some justice
You can tell the age of the rocks by the layer.   You can tell the layer by the age of the rocks...  (circular reasoning).  Gtfo.  $$$
Just need to be ready, so you don't have to get ready.
It’s not an ugly scar!
Get your clean diapers ready, the earth is getting angry.
Read the Bible, it tells you about earth creation. Oh know then you will have to believe  in the only true God and his son Jesus Christ.
Your out of date with your dating of the age of the sun, go check the latest readings, and you will see they recently updated it and are saying that the sun is now 8-12 billion years old ! LoL ! So this means that the sun has now aged between 3.5 - 8.5 billion years in my lifetime ! That is what I call going fast !
I visited California and was in an earthquake. Lovely place ,just beautiful,but wouldn't want to live there. This coming BIG quake will kill many. LA will be gone as we know it, i believe. Yikes!  and the Ocean waves will effect many around the world. God be with us all ! The big question is still .. When?
Put Dr. Fauci on it........He'll get it all worked out.
. Any moment now. i have always heard that California was gonna be the death of all of us. I wouldnt want to be the people who wanna live there. You couldn't pay me millions to live there.
Discovered in 1885, you’d think they would have grown the city elsewhere?
Do these so call experts really think 🤔 that this Earth is millions of years old?   How about human beings? I know that the Bible and DNA Both Prove that this planet along with humans is just a few thousand years old.
How can we believe anything these scientists say when the talk about the earth being over 100 million years old?
How can we believe anything these scientists say when they talk about the earth being 100 million years old!  Really?
Still waitin'     san madre will go before your san andreas  so put that in yer pipe an smoke  it..mine will make the mississippi run backwards  your's may shake the coastal cities into the pacific but that's no big deal or loss as they've known its coming but...
I hope it takes out pelosis
California one day is gonna disappear  Everybody knows that
"Help "
I'm in Las Vegas , today had to move off a fault line quite active , I 've Heard rocks cracking down deep underground at two previous addresses  , " nowhere to run , nowhere man too hide "
This is nothing compared to the destruction Newsome’s Health care will cause the middle class
And I can anybody prove that the Earth is over 10 or 20 or 50 million years old you need to read the Bible man existed in the beginning so if you could show me proof that the Earth is that old
I can’t believe Communistfornia doesn’t have an earthquake tax
Sacrifice California’s politicians into the fault to stave off disaster 😉
San Andreas will happen on August 12 2023
Good timing for you to spread fear. You media loves this madness you spread.
Tonga volcano release magma tension or will it push platelets to quake? Fracking does.
Sylmar quake we were living out in the Palmdale , Acton area and we could see the land move like a wave very strange to see and feel....that's the area that will funnel and intensify a quake to flatten the LA area what a mess that will be...
2022: hold my beer
The feds are always bailing out Calif from earthquakes, floods, drought, whatever.  Can you imagine how many $ grants have been made for this?
The continental plates were taught in California Elementary Schools 55 years ago, significantly longer then the 40 years quoted by the narrator.
Learn to pronounce Marin!
Amazing to me that everyone who claims the earth is billions of years should also wonder at what size would the sun be at billions of years. The sun doesn’t remain the same like the earth.
99 percent chance in 29 years.
If they could just figure what is causing the Pacific Plate to move northward and eliminate that cause, then the problem would be solved.
It is going to go off in 2022 and it will be devastating like no one has ever seen
I have to watch this video for school..I’m gonna loose my mind
Born and raised in Lodi Calif. Now i lived next town over in Galt Calif. I have lived in Valley Springs Calif which the next town is San Andreas. Been through 2 moderate (as they called it )earthquakes. The 89 earthquake that took out a section of the Bay Bridge and destroyed alot of SF i lived in Lodi about a hour and 1/2 from SF.  My house moved 2 feet off the foundation. Heard all my life about the Big 1 but have never really gave alot of thought even now about it. But as each year that passes and the major changes the past couple years around the world, i am not taking anything for granite living right below where fault line starts. Just live day by day and more aware of things. That is what brought me to this video.
The way California's right now I do not want to see any innocent people get hurt men women or children! But I'm telling you as of right now that politicians in California have to be forced to get the fear of God in them! Show that money is not everything clout is not everything! Family Safety is everything! Everyone has to come back to Jesus he is our savior! Do you hear that politicians do you think you'll Mighty dollars going to save you no it's not!! Good luck! And the rest of population was smart they would get the heck out of California.
COME ON MAN   thats what the rest of the country keeps saying  !!! before the libtard woke idiots start moving into the interior of the country !!!
Correction San Francisco will be a suburb of Los Angeles.
Hug nut?
When? not soon enough
So are we saying the San Andreas fault is due to climate change 🤔? I mean everything is due to climate change, 🤔 if I stub my toe, climate change did it.
When the San Andreas lets go everything to the East will fall into the Atlantic Ocean!😂
I live at the end of the Fault. In Puget Sound. Born in Marin at the North End of the G.G. Bridge. Grom one End to the other.
WOW
I have been hearing this since the sixties. WELL? ? ?
*✝️ Not dear San Andreas, you won't be welcome so, please 🙏 STAY AS YOU ARE      AT LIST FOR ANOTHER 🤔...300 YEARS.‼️*
Learn to swim and I'll meet ya down at Arizona bay.
Gov is been building tunnels under ground all over California,,that what is going to make earth quakes
I'm in Las Vegas , on top of a fault line , I'm m sh as king
Being born in California we have always wondered that. I lived in Stockton when the 1986, earthquake hit San Francisco. But since California has a big problem with drought it’s a wonder central California hasn’t imploded.

Neat documentary ,too many commercials though.
Great
This makes me want to go outside and look for cracks around to try to investigate it lol
The San Andreas fault runs right beside the 7 oaks dam, one of the largest earthen dams( at least at the time it was built). Sounds like pretty poor planning in my opinion. Too close for comfort.
No one is going to comment about ol'hugnut
This documentary was made when?
Honestly I would of thought it was just really cr@ppy concrete work.
The truth is scary
I got it looking like New Orleans....
Do you think the people will come together or fall apart like Katrina?
Don't forget the giant astroid and global warming, the great flood ,the Ozone layer being gone on and on let's panic were all doomed !
I should of been a geologist
They're preparing for a 7.8? They better think again!
Narrator: "The only certainty it's THAT YOU ARE ALL GOING TO DIE"
Well hurr up then..h8dalow
Why don't you mention about New York and California too!
And the property taxes and property values are going up up up and away
Let's get all the illegal people, give them a shovel, and dig on the fault, maybe it would break and float off, Hank Johnson lol
👏⚡💥
California is beautiful state and nice weather but earthquake turn me off. No ,thank you , I don't move to Calf.
Tectonic plate thought to be  way  out  to  sea. Actually has moved ( called = Subduction ) under ground miles under northern California if the plate shift's it can trigger San Andreas fault line . The clock is ticking it is  nolonger will it it BUT only is a question of when
May california get wiped out. Politics and moral decline have really put me on edge when i used to live there. Now i live happily in the great state of florida. Just really happy i dont live in the dumps anymore
What made the city shake...bath houses?
I was 10, lives in San Jose CA in 1989. The Loma prieta earthquake. It was nuts, but according to this scientist it's a baby compared to the big one that hasn't happened yet.
Luis.... A magnitude 500Billion strong hitting Califórnia. Striking once again 🥑💊👑📜📜⛪🏛️🔨👷🏿‍♂️🧳🕌🤑👑💅🏞️🌊✂️🍆🍼👷🏽‍♀️🌎🫁🫀🧠👁️ Citizens living in constant fear inflicted by the LAW ! Je suis à putein. Je suis fabuleux.
TOO MANY ADS THAT INTERRUPT MY TRAIN OF FOCUS.
I had heard many, many years ago that because of the fault line there is a possibility that California could break away from the United States. Is that even possible?
These scientists have absolutely no proof that San Andreas was formed 20 million years ago, some of the things seem to be accurate but the lies between them are just mind boggling
yall degenerates in callie gonna catch some karma for all your insanity
Now they’re fracking the San Andreas fault.  How stupid is the human race?  Just like east of the Sierra Nevada range they’re fracking the Long Valley Caldera.  Makes me wonder how stupid is the human race?
Good thing they got Hudnut on the job!
This video is real old. Make a new one.
Can we take a second to appreciate that old white guys hair line
There is only one explanation for how the earth was made. It was spoken  into existence by GOD👍🙏🏻🙏🏻 Almighty. Science has finally proven that the great flood and Noah's ark existed. What other  factual history would you like to know. Read it for yourself in the Bible😁✌️👍
2021 or 2022  would be a fine time for it to strike CA and relieve the rest of the country from the idiocy there.
where is the Mega Disaster episode of the New Madrid quakes
41:54 Get in Z Choppa..👊
I WOULD BUILD RIGHT ON TOP THAT
Stay out, 101, its going to blow, , I have seen 101 for months, I won't even go to California,  and I am still on fault in Washington state, but away from,  California
"About to strike" ...yeah, yeah. Promises, promises. I have been waiting for the Land of Fruits and Nuts to slide into the sea almost my whole life.  It would solve SO many problems.      (edit, 11 months later...)   STILL WAY-TINGGG!
100 million year old rocks?  Watch is Genesis History for a different perspective on cataclysmic events.
Shake, Rattle ,Roll is 10 times worse if up and down rather than swaying.  Believe me, I know.  Living in Reno/Sparks. Nevada
Move all the demoncrats and illegals  there.  Have all the decent US lovers move away.  Good way to get rid of the Hollywood pedo, so called elistists.
Lol the earth was just restyling it’s self 💀💀💀💀
I live ON the San Andreas fault in Wrightwood CA
Millions of people in California worrying about everyone wearing a mask that questionabally doss nothing and they virtue signaling to tell others how to live. Also, those same people also ignoring that they live on the San Andreas Fault and could be wiped out anytime. They should get in their Prius and get out of dodge. Actually, on second thought just stay put.
THE WALKING TRAILS THEY JUST INSTALLED AROUND CITY OF HENDERSON, NEVADA HAVE FOUR TO SIX INCH CRACKS FROM EARTH'S MOVEMENT.
And thaaan.....
The lord owns this celestial ball earth. God himself created it. Man cannot take credit for it. The only thing man wants to do is blow it up.
code name  Shake Out.   Geeee   hard to break that code.
How can we monitor this. Is there a monitoring center, website.
NEWSOME ain't governing, so perhaps, NATURE WILL
Why on earth dont they drive big wooden stakes in the ground in these areas around the fault to hold the plates in place?
Great video but while I agree  it's 2021 tic toc
Be a shame to lose Hollyweird..
That's what took jappan.
Probably a,9.er.will hit..
Age of the earth..is,a,grand guess..but I like the rest of the show..yoho
GOD burned up California so that the next time HE shakes it real good, it will snap off like peanut brittle.
Good  documentary but  the  music  was  crazy   annoying!!
I've walk down some of it. Odd feeling.
I remember 20 million years ago.  I was in San Diego and suddenly there was a crackling noise deep below me.  I began to feel the course sand below my feet and suddenly I was in San Francisco.
I live in Louisiana A few years ago I felt the first earth quake I have ever felt in my life. I guess it's what a Californian would call a tremor. Louisiana sits on the world's largest natural gas deposit that reaches all the way to Pennsylvania. It also sits on a fault line that cuts the country in half. The oil pipeline runs through here to. I hate to think about what happens when all the  lubricant is taken out of an ever moving ground. What happens with the earth has no oil to lubricate its fault lines?
Lots of vile, sadistic, toxic terrible people in this comments section wishing mass death upon thier fellow man because of political differences I hope y'all know what immoral monsters you all are the only evil here is you.  Y'all just further proof why the rightwing is fascist by definition.
The sooner the better to rid the world of some of its stupid
Once the plate  shifts further east it will slide underneath Yellowstone and cause a catastrophic eruption
how do you prepare for imminent danger, live like danger is going to happen , pretty soon
I would love to watch this video, but it is infested with ads- not just at the beginning. Too distracting.
Now if the "Big One" can just get on with it, the US will finally be free of Californication for good and the gene pool will be far cleaner!
We are ok with California and Florida breaking off the mainland - The rest of the United States
Just face the fact you have no idea if or when it will happen.
Let it rip.
"The wife and I bought some oceanfront property in Nevada," says the grizzled old man. "There ain't no ocean in Nevada," says his buddy. The first guy chuckles, takes a long swig of Bud Lite, and responds: "Will be once that earthquake hits."
I just cant wait till it breaks and sends california swimming
This professor don't have a clue about how old the San Andres fall is. They speak on billions, of years , just like smoking a sigaret. They should take a time to read the holy Bible.and stop guessing something like this. The only thing that comes out of there mouth 👄 is billions of years
Yes she is, and imma tell u who to blame:    "THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATI6N"!!!
@13:52  Knock , Knock  Geologist: "Sir, we are here to let you and your neighbors know about a serious fault in your area. You have built your home on an active earthquake fault. " Mr. Lizard : "Yes, I don't care. My family goes generations back, back in the mammoth days. I'll be fine. Good day.  Geologist: "But Sir" Mr. Lizard : " I said, GOOD DAY! " Geologist (to himself): well, may you be blessed.
WOW! IF YOU WERE THINKING OF MOVING TO CALIFORNIA YOU MIGHT RECONSIDER... LOL 😆 🤣 🤯
1:35 is so random.
I have to wonder if they ever find gold GS or other precious metals & rare Earth's in these core samples???!
Hollister is why LEX LUTHER WILL OWN ALL BEACH FRONT PROPERTY
His name is HUGG NUTZ????!!!!
More but fake news lol 😆  so funny if you guys actually believe in earthquakes then I feel bad for you 😅 🤣
If I lived out in the west I would be moving...the question is where to?
I was thinking about moving to San Diego, or Tijuana.  Idk anymore while watching this though.
California and New York will both feel the wrath of God, soon.
Let California go into the pacific. No loss.
One part of the property is going  this way,  and the other side is going  the other way. WHAT a Surveyor's Nightmare. Should use Satellite imagery, which I suppose they have done now.
There's a channel on here that the man that started the channel correctly forecasts earthquakes location and magnitude on a regular basis. Dutchsinse is the name of the channel.
Nostradamus says, November 25th.
Some Say " It's San Andreas's Fault " , Some Say " It's GTA Sandreas's Fault " .. Mmmm
George Carlin Said It Best .. All Born On Earth Get A Ticket To The Show , If Born In America , You Got Front Row Seating To The Show .. Sit Down , Shut Up , Become A SPECTATOR And Enjoy The Shiznik Show ..               From Greater Boston Area , Massachusetts USA
Seeing that this was released 10 months ago, goes to show that like most on here it's b.s.
This planet is amazing,. Other planets really unknown ,so I can not imagine someone wants to live on another one.
How the earth was formed*
about to strike eh.. this videos isnt aging well.
🤔 💭⏳
Ya know these are really really smart people using really advanced tools putting together a picture puzzle of something they have never seen. How many pieces has grumpy ol' Mother Earth kept in her pocket?
Pretty soon I’ll have oceanfront property in Arizona. Hey, wait a minute,😳Wasn’t that a song?🧐
If "the big one hits" I wonder if the Yellowstone volcano will blow its top and if so how big will it be
Can’t wait for it to happen hope it happens in my lifetime
These ppl are whacked none of that stuff happened in millions of yrs it happend quickly these ppl have no clue. They are a mess
Not soon enough
They want to keep doing evil see what happens
Everything I show you I'll have knowledge of why you think I show it to you you think I just pick it out of thin air
I told you this before
I find it curious, that they use clips from buildings collapsing in the Marina district of San Francisco after the '89 quake, and refer to it as damage in LA LA land! While not even referring to it (the 89 quake) in the program. They will talk of the damage to LA or SF, but rarely tell you of the damage away from the 'population' centers. Santa Cruz CA and much of Monterey Bay were without power for 7-10 days after that.  In about 15 seconds, the whole town of Santa Cruz was moved North 2 feet and up 2 feet. Think about that. Everyone was looking at San Francisco.
A few years ago, a friend wanted me to make a trip to the west coast..... it scared me so bad I didn't go, for fear of a earthquake, volcano etc I stayed home, and luckily nothing happened.  I refused to go on the trip, and was worried all the time they were gone, I have friends that live there, but I will not visit.
I'll get my popcorn, and beer! Waiting
Oh my gosh you can totally see this if you go to lake Billy's Chinook  Oregon I've lived my last 62 year's on the San Andreas fault line. I've all way's enjoyed the land scape of Bakersfield where I had to hide under my school desk during a quake to San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Sacramento to Twain Heart, long barn,  California,  The redwood forest, Southern Oregon, Portland and Seattle. Love to hike in the Great Northwest. Just a hippys child on the road in the school bus in the Early sixtys thur the 80s
This is an incomplete and frequently mispronounced narrative. There are all kinds of locations where earthquake debris still resides. For example, the seawall in front of the Marina Green in the Marina district is composed of earthquake debris from 1906. You can see entire concrete stairwells and other forms of masonry right underneath the seawall. All placed there to stabilize the area in preparation for the 1915 world’s fair.  And Marin county is accented on the second syllable.  Many more errors than these ….
Will never happen
Will never happen
Interesting! However you cannot detected when and how it will happened....our Earth is a living organism created and established by God's laws of creation....He is the ultimate knowledge of all science and wisdom.  As I have studied and researched our Earth's wonders, I am still strongly convinced that we are approaching the Day when our Earth will give up on all the abuse and distress, we have inflicted in our environment such as: oil fracking, nuclear testing, wars, technology warfare and explotation, geoengineering, soil depletion due to chemical use treatment to crops, weather warfare where no longer we have a natural jet stream system on the contrary is only man-made weather warfare...causing major weather disaster such as super hurricanes, cyclones, volcanoes erupting along the line of the tectonic plates, major floods, etc. Right now, we have a total of 58 volcanoes' eruption along the Tectonic Plates along with them: major earthquakes activities along the Ring of Fire...not mentioning what is happening in our heavens...we are approching major "doom day" over our heads...the space debris is overwhelming...celestial dust and space debris from all the satellites' chunk flowing around us...the sun, the moon and the stars are changing their patterns and positions....while the lies about Earth and Heavens continues...it just remind me when humans beings are going to stop mixing lies and truth when it comes as the Bible KJV Genesis Chapter 1:1-31 indicated:   1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.  14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

Or in a glass house.
Be careful.  ❤️
Gee, the thought of having Commi-fornia slide into the Pacific Ocean doesn't seem like it would be such bad thing for the rest of the country.  You say it's just a matter of time, and the rest of us say "Do you promise?"
Too high for this
The New Madrid is equally as dangerous (on the Mississippi River) history does repeat itself. Do not forget it.
Great 👍 documentary
whos to say if the drilling didnt make the cracks in the first place - ive seen this in wood drills - there no way it could happen - drill bigger areas look at the middle for sure this is a question that needs looked at i dont believe this at all
drilling operations making them its what one guy said it caused from o well
somewhere theres a hole somewhere you would think right yes - i dont believe this stuff its wrong
you all are nuts its you made any kinda number up its not right now in text books im right  so whats this -
the fence story dont make since - there should be a sink hole then where the dirt at then - today is it a sink hole now or not can you really tell me this i know you cant do it
caused by sinful people looking it up in the bible man its not this hard to figure it out why is it not 100.000.000 years old you dont know this im right on it its pretty easy thats a long time its not true
its only 6000 to 7000 years old man you know its true man come on who you kidding  well known the flood was destroyed cause of sinful people only 8 lived on earth then - you wont listen these things happen
I’m here after multiple earthquakes in California 😂
It'd be funny if there was a massive program to inject large amounts of talcum into the fault to keep it flowing smoothly.
The question I have regards the super shear tests. Its all well and good to do that on a block of plastic and get stupendous results, but how does that calculate in regular 1:1 scale. They don't say it on the program. After digging around its interesting to note that apparently supershear has been associated with 6.4 and up. That certainly bears consideration.
Move east maybe ?
I hate watching these videos only because I end up being terrified by the end of the video. But I cannot resist from watching these kind of videos because they are so interesting to learn. However, I'm in my bed right now watching this video while living in Southern California. And although we've been waiting for this major quake to happen for so long, I'm very superstitious now that it will happen sometime very soon. The funny thing is that I haven't always lived in California. I used to live on the other side of the country in Florida and even in Texas at one point almost 10 years ago. I've already wanted to move out of California for plenty of reasons besides this one, so I'm just praying that if the San Andreas fault were to happen soon that it will happen after I move out of California. I do not want to be here when it happens, and it will really bother me that it so happens to occur right when I'm living in California and not when I was in Florida or Texas before. For anyone who is also living in California; stay safe, protect your loved ones, and be prepared when this quake happens. ❤
by the way the earth is only 6000 years old this guy is lying
yep its going to blow the same time the rapture happens the title wave thats going to hit the east coast the power will go out with all the volcanos going off  the planes dropping out of the sky crashing the cars crashing fires everywhere people disappearing and little kids and babies vanishing people are going to freak out they wont know what happened ? its called the rapture of the church that took place and all his prople that believed in him and excepted him into there hearts as there lord and savior went to heavan to be with him ! there will be a big deception coming from your president saying millions are missing and we all been abducted by aliens or a space ship dont believe it its a big lie we been har/pot/zoed out of here or cought up !
Yes I agree we all know and yes just live your life . the earth quake we had the big one was frightening but being in one I got over my fear of one we had lots of tremors and so forth . I pray if another happens that my Grandchild and family live through it
You mean the imminent Big One, which we have been waiting for over 70 years?
You couldn't pay me to live in any part of California.
I can wait until this destroys 2 of the most evil cities in the usa
Well now they Gavin Numbnuts to take care of them, I say it is time for another big one.
People have been saying this forever
History teaches us that people don't learn from history.
41:35 Couldn’t the shock start somewhere else? Guess we are taking a shot on this one. Lol
10 million frames per second!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
you would think the History Channel has enough money to hire narrators who know how to pronounce "Marin" county.....
The democrats should want this. It would help depopulate the world
Earthquakes is a warning to something greater. However, after it happens,some complain, some blame others or God and God warns all of us in the bible in Matt 24:7; look it up, read it for yourself and learn that God has been warning All of us, that what these scientist are discovering, is going to happen! When?
La FALLA de San Andreas!! or BIG ONE!!  @True Innegable!!! SOon Incoming how TRUE!!! 2021
24:24 I laughed a little too hard…
Ok.
California would be no great loss to the rest of the country simply alot garbage and plastic people
Oh yes it is one of the worst vaults. Even as far as it stretches to  Connecticut. My apartment rests on part of it.
Give it some time(within 1,000 years) and California will be an Island.
Does anyone else see the sad face at 19:55
They say over the years all that will be left is the desert!!
Can this get further and further apart? What does this prove? Does that mean that part of California will fall into the Pacific?
Better think all u miss fits
this is an example of how they show you evidence on one side only trying to get viewer, any geologist will tell you or if you remember in history class the san andrea fault is a strike and slip fault, which is the least dangerous of all type of fault line, because the quakes happen alot but in small release of energy.  Not like a convergent fault in japan etc that cause massive release of energy.    every year we have a small quake, every 5 year we have a bigger ones that you can feel it, this is why we dont have the so cal "big one" that they describe, the evidence they show you are only from one side of the story, do your own research deep into it and you will see.  I cannot type everything in the comment here.
God gave me the vision of the big one. It was beyond conception. Sounded like 500 fighter jets over head but was the sound of roaring ocean and ground tearing apart. It was a 50 kilometre drop over the edge of the fault downward. All I could see was blue mist from the ocean so high it met the sky. Seemed like the whole planet was splitting in half but it was simply the curvature of the view of the earth. It's going to be more than a 7.0  It will be OFF the Richter scale.  Way way over. Say 20. William Branhams prophecy will come true on youtube.  Also, Nostradamus sets a date at Nov. 25th 2021.
It's San Andres
How long have they predicted this? Maybe one day but most likely not for years and years
California deserves to be destroyed. I hope it happens soon.
It’s not the  Earth’s fault that humans build on the most obvious disaster prone place on the North American coast. Now that builders had no warnings. Would it have anything to do with speculation or money? Buyer beware.
There's nothing you can do.your best bet is to run for hills
I got news for you folks. There will be an earthquake beyond the size of measure whereby the entire N.American landmass lurches westward splitting the San Andreas and consequently propagating mega-tsunamis throughout the world. I witnessed this in an OBE and it was pretty horrifying. Waves cresting and breaking onto land at over 1,000 feet in height.
Shake: Rattle: And Roll.
Mannn i was in Fairfield Ca during 89 bay quake... At CC lol i was in Lake Arrowhead for LA northridge & the big 1 in oahu that knocked out alll power on island 56 hours straight. 2 days away from absolut zero for food. Hawaii has a 4 day food supply. If the boats stop or power goes out for 4 days there will be absolute chaos.. This is how stupid govt is
These events have been foretold almost 2,000 years ago.  Many events are recorded over two thousand years ago in the Old Testament.  Our media hide what’s really happening behind Covid coverage but if you are interested in what is really happening around the world to fulfill Bible prophecy pull up “The two Preachers.” It will blow your mind what is being hidden so the world is not warned of the,soon to happen, 7 year “Tribulation” period.   The Church will be rescued just prior to the start of this horrific set of Judgements on a fallen world.  If you don’t feel prepared for what’s coming, the first and third chapters of the Gospel of John (kJV) describe the Deity of Messiah and God’s perfect, loving and exclusive plan for redemption and salvation.
I think I'm going to buy up thousands of acres on the San Andreas and when the BIG ONE hits and  1/2 of the land sinks into the Pacific ocean just think of all the beach front property I'll have I'll be RICH!!!
Thank god I’m in Atlanta
😱 😱 😱  I think I should move to NY and leave LA behind, and maybe I should do it ASAP.
Chyren Selin says beware the fault is about to snap.  God will roar from shore to shore
So many people would be happy if The People’s Republic of California fell into the Pacific.
Fascinating
I live in San Bernardino and I always feel like that fault about to break open anyday
Roughly 300’ in 3,000 years? Yeah, think I’ll just sit tight, …
I had a dream 9 yrs ago that the Big One earthquake ocurred this year! California has had 5 mayor quakes ,this one would rupture the state and break it in half. It was a horrible nightmare, all buildings were falling through the quake's cracks. The city was in flames, the houses were shacking and been destroyed. The dream said 3 ,3 ,3 in big red. That was in 2012! Now it is 9 years later. Was it a psychic dream that it can happen this year? I have been having psychic dreams since I was 6 (the 80's). Some occur the following day or many years later. I can read people's minds too at times. Could this be another psychic dream? Are scientists putting something underneath the land to avoid the friction of the plates?
Maybe it will shake the whole southern part of the state off into the ocean.
Yellowstone is in overdrive, plates are already showing signs of a (not far off) cataclysmic event. If you live anywhere in California or the northwest area, get your house in order; it's coming sooner than anyone expects.
180:37:10‼️
You KNOW the San Andreas Fault is there. You KNOW it causes earthquakes. You KNOW anything you build on top of it has a very good chance of being destroyed.  You KNOW  earthquakes are going to continue.  AND YET . . . What do YOU do ??? YOU  show just how STUPID  you are and CONTINUE TO BUILD ON TOP OF THE FAULT !!! Then YOU have the nerve to get upset because what YOU  build gets destroyed  !!! Can YOU  say DUH !!!
it has been 105 everyday for over 4 months now. Pretty sure the heat will kill us before the earthquake does.
I hope it takes Portland out too! Please Mother Nature will heed my call!
The moderator mentioned how the tetanic plates were formed millions of years ago, and I agreed, I was there when they formed... and some of these guys were there too!
In the Quran it mentions a huge earthquake will happen in 3 places in the world. The West Coast being one of them.
30:20 If you were to ask me ‘can you predict when a earthquake is going to happen?’ My answer would be no, because I know what your really asking me. Which is, ‘can you predict when a earthquake is going to happen?’
Don't we have a nuclear plant rt there?
Maybe this is why Jeffrey star left California and now lives in Wyoming..lol
Build a massive city on a fault line and fill it with liberals best idea ever.
When the earth moves. It's an earthquake. But no other movement at any time. The earth is still and motionless. Wake up and see the horizon
This just popped up as a YouTube recommendation. Well ,luckily this came out 9 months ago.
I went from Louisiana to South of Los Angelese to pick my son up from boot camp and in the mountains east of LA there was a sign  that said "Future water front property for sale.....
If someone makes a video and it happens, just think of the glory some one may acquire
It's not a proper earthquake documentary unless everyone in it at some point says, "It's not if, it's when." Every major west coast university has a month long seminar teaching studii how to recite that statement in every language known to mankind.
I drive across the San Andreas driving right past Parkfield at least once a month.
Too bad we keep diminishing the natives of this land we call America…I’m sure they could’ve given some something if their history hadn’t been pretty much erased…
Consider the possibility that "plate tectonics happened on a much faster time scale during and after the Great Flood of Noah,  It's referred to a CATASTROPHIC plate tectonics and is well covered here on YouTube!
You have to believe it. It's been coming immediately for the last 70 years.
Heard anything about the New Madrid which will be much worse or just as bad and half the people know about it
Dropping 40000 tonight bombs next to it dnt help
Come on baby,do your thing.
I just hope when it hits I'm not at work. They've been saying the big one is coming since I was two. I'm 52 now and still waiting!!
10,9,8,7,6,5.........☮️
Ah, it's the History channel.   smh
And sooner or later God's going to get tired of holding that thing together 12 Californians spit in his face and he's just going to let it go Let it go Let it go Let it go
It will be a glorious day when California falls off into the ocean.
San Andreas, we would just lose California mainly, so nothing major. The one you need to worry about is Yellowstone fully erupting that would be global.
As long as doesn’t happen during taking a 💩 🚽
I think we can afford a bit less carbon emissions from humans in that area. Global warming is THE most threatening thing in our world today. This area creates much of the global warming in that part of the world.
If people read the bible it will tell when n why God allows earthquakes  Mathew24 its says before Christ come back to earth there would be earthquakes in diver place n men  hearts will fear becuz of what's coming on the earth.
I've always wondered if there was intellegent life on this planet waaaaay before us.
Nice whatching what is going to happen any given time to the place I live...😳😳😳.
The nutritious niece early raise because opinion selectively touch underneath a zealous ex-husband. synonymous, godly offer
What if a huge San Andreas earthquake causes the Cascadia fault to also cause an earthquake, or vice versa?
If only the history channel was more about content like this and less garbage reality shows that they are now.
As a SoCal resident, I’d rather face the San Andreas risk ANY day than live near the Cascadia subduction zone!!
I think its dumb that the richest people live there. They could disappear of earth anyway now
7.8??!! I didn't know that's what the 1906 was. Geez. And w buildings the way they were bk then. Today would b even worse I'm sure 🌹🌹❤️
And that's just LA. Itsc800 milesvoong
I hope it doesn't happen anytime soon. Left-wing lunatics will just spread and infect this country further. Let them have their toilet bowl cities. Anything short of a mega tsunami is no help.
Proof that not even scientists can save us from God's wrath...
Anything man builds God can destroy (if he chooses to) in seconds...
All of these scientific tests we pay for does nothing to prevent earthquakes...
Which came first...the burning bush or the rock it burned in????? LOLOLOLOL
There are even greater forces involved that demonicrats will always fail to understand...
Good!!! The sooner calyfornia falls off into the ocean the better!!!!!
I have been hearing this for 40 years
24:24 what did the driver think was gonna happen lmaoo
If it's the same scientists that believe in global warming,  I am not concerned.
Hope Nancy Pelosi is in the middle of this great split..... God Bless America
Like one person said it’s like school but this time I don’t feel like sleeping or saying I hate it
Continents float.
Sorry... Can't watch these as the narrator sounds like a WWF announcer Less dramatic please!
Just started watching BUT how does that compare to the Cascadia Subduction Zone BIG-ONE?? OR can it??
8:39 this man has my sense of humor lmaoO
Some of us Californians are going to have our properties become Ocean front properties naturally!!!
Um... that's pronounced ma-RIN County.
At this point in time this would be a beautiful thing.  And the tidal wave would level China.  Two birds with one really big stone.
Good explanation except for the typical History Channel fear-mongering sensationalism.
So, we should quit sinking money into the areas at highest risk to incentivize the people living their to move. Instead the liberals keep sinking money into the pit incentivizing more drug addicts, homeless, and illegal immigrants to move there. Kinda asinine, aye?
Dutchsinse does a GREAT JOB OF PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES.
Ok, ready for Cali to fall off into the ocean.
I used to live in Hollister lmaoo wtf
The time in time is coming when the whole earth will be shaken, mountains all over the world will crumble. Islands will disappear. In perspective,  even California's " big one" will be counted a small thing.
You can Smell an Earthquake Why not create Smelling Instruments? Just a little Fat on your Head.
Learn to swim! See ya down in Arizona bay you turds
Learn to swim
We are born develop rush thru life before we die, understanding this Fault and others, be careful what you wish for?
Sick. This tale is 8 months old.  Liars; we, most of all the West coast know all this.   We make fresh water from the seawater, we will make more.  Remember the depression in middle America, & America who moved West.  California is the 5th largest economy on Earth today.  Science Fiction is a fact in, California and America.  Earth is the  ONLY concern we humans must deal, be responsible for the plunder, destruction of our human future. The fact is we "F"ed up for greed.  "BILLIONAIRES" in  America.
🤞 im ok with California falling into the ocean.
Not _Nearly_ as Dangerous as the *C S Z *.....!!!!
this is the sounds i hear nearly everyday here in california
Waiting with popcorn!!
Respect the history it will repeat 💯.  Thanks History çhannel for this information.
I was in the ‘69 and ‘71 big quakes in Southern California. No big deal. Some structures were damaged, a freeway overpass fell down but seriously, it was not something to be afraid of. If you were watching the news, you were brainwashed into thinking that all of California was destroyed. Don’t be a sheeple. The news is not your friend. It never is. Sensationalism for advertising dollars. Don’t be fooled people. California is just fine.
Imagine if it snapped California right off the map and into the ocean, never to be seen again ?
What is funny is the cascade fault, when it hits it hits big, tsunamis places like Vancouver, Origen. are gonna have major damage but the real kicker is it will give san adreas a big kick as well.
This is not like school because I'm learning.
didn't they make a movie about placing small thermonuclear devices in deep wells along the fault ?
your governor will have advanced warning laughing down on you
please don't move......you'll be fine.....
Even more dangerous is cascadia
Let's not forget the corruption in S.F. that allowed the tragedy to grow so wildiy out of control .   The city fathers who left the city afterwards, never to return, before their corruption was laid bare.  The many water cisterns built for fighting fires, that instead of holding 100's of thousands of gallons, were in actuality only a foot deep. And perhaps one of the biggest lies that the quake started the fires, when hundreds of building owners lit their own crumpled buildings, because they had fire insurance, but not earthquake insurance. During the rebuilding afterwards, sensible distances between houses were not enforced, all so the corrupt government could reclaim more tax dollars. The place was once beautiful, but has once again returned to the cesspool of 1906.
Waiting for the San Andreas fault to go is like waiting for your wife to give birth after being in labor for 50 years!
I say let it happen and let California break off and sail into the sunset! Buh bye!!👋👋👋👋
Hope schumer and puttyfacepelosi are on the west side
Has a title 🌊 wave ever hit the Los Angeles basin ? 🤔
If people no that a disaster is coming why not get out. I've been hearing this for years and praying it will not come. But it is just a matter of time. Why not save yourself and your children you can get out of it. Please do something for yourself and families 😪
If continents constantly shift then why are ancient sun dials still accurate?
How do we fix the San Andreas fault 🤔
God grabbed ahold of the United States and shook it hard up and down. All the fruits and nuts rolled to California.
San Andreas is not my fault
Apparently Santa Rosa will be "red" in the next quake.  Good thing I live on the other side of the Mayacamas.  :-)
Muscle Rock use to yield gigantic stripe bass in the 1970's.
Hi, question for any real estate experts or housing experts in general ??? What will happen to the prices of homes, what will happen to the land, and overall  real estate market in California after "the big one" hits. I cannot find any articles on an issue like this. What happens if people do not rebuild, will the area become worthless? Will the government reclaim property that is neglected/abandoned ?
Why wasn't the grass impacted when the picket fence moved 8 feet apart? One would expect to see a rift in the ground.
IF I HAD A PENNY FOR EVERY TIME I'VE HEARD THIS...I'D BE ON EASY STREET!
Radiocarbon dating is a joke science that cannot be trusted and anyone who uses and trusts it in their fields is a joke scientist and gas turned their field into a joke as well. There are so many factors that can easily contaminate a radiocarbon date. You can run a radiocarbon date test on a clam that died today and it may tell you the clam died several thousand years ago. Why? Because an oceanic current carried organisms that died several thousand years ago to where the clam made it’s bed and filtered the rich water currents through it’s body and thus filtered out those thousand year old organisms from the water.  Don’t trust radiocarbon dating. It is an absolute joke.
"Within the next 30 years".   They litereally were saying the same thing 30 years ago. Sigh.
39:50. Around 1999 or 2000 near Lake Isabella, California, I heard a small earthquake rupture deep inside the earth and I could hear the sound from the shock wave travel through the bed rock just like the scientists explained.
Doesn’t have me sold, Why isn’t there a canyon between the two fences if the earth jolt it apart
November the 25th 2021 California will leave America and be lost to the seas
2021: Therefore, now at 99% probability in next 18 years.
I learned in college that the epicenter will be San Bernardino. This entire documentary never even mentioned San Bernardino.
Maybe God wants to rectify the horror known as California, land of evil!
The dapper waterfall unprecedentedly decorate because triangle excitingly paint onto a outgoing existence. alleged, wry russia
My take-away: California needs to powder its crack.
There's video proof that the big one already hit California. Where is this narrator getting his information?. Fear mongolin again I guess
The bloods and crips will have a peace treaty when the earthquake hits LA😳
California should just ban these high capacity assault earthquakes, even delineate some earthquake-free zones, you’ll see this stuff stop right quick... Larry Elder for Governor, RECALL newsom, September 14 2021
Creek and River properties suffered much worse damage during loma Prieta Quake. What the realtor forgot to mention.
Arizona bay is on the way woo hoo!
It's not that simple, when you are cripled and get divorced for the pain. You cant laugh. YOU MAKE IT SIMPLE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
If the two towns are floating on a massive high tensile Granite type bed rock. Holding back high mechanical Stress and deep crack failures.? The low yield concrete fractures are weaker with no Tectonic plate loading, or failures.  Could you drill holes either side, the high risk fault Points? Then drop in "Sound / Earth movement Sensors?  Then use 5G signal  Data, wirelessly to a Computer - So You have a grid" - You could Monitor movement Or Sound changes (ground fractures) failures "make noise" as Rock or Earth starts to  move.

If  there  are  Rich  people  who  live  in the  United States  then  they  have  a  responsibility  to  their  country  and  pay  their  own  taxes  if  they  don't  pay  then  they  can  go  to  prison  for  a long period of time  and  still  have  to  pay  their  taxes  someone  from  the  IRS.  Will  be  taking  care  of  all  their  taxes  for  10 years  or  more  if  people  don't  want  to  pay  this  is  what  should  be  happening  i  think
Typical Humans, Thinking We Have Mother Nature Figured Out. How's That Worked Out For Us So Far 🤔
It ain't over. Just don't know when. Wait. What about an large asteroid ? We'll be able to see that 🪨 before it lands.
I am sitting exactly 500feet off the San Andreas fault line as I type this. I have lived near it for 40 years. Absolutely fascinating!!!!!!   Thank you for this video!
I lived in Orange County for 8 years back in the 80,s. I never felt an earthquake during that period of time, although there were dozens recorded. I moved to the Midwest and felt a 3.4 within the first 3 months.
California is gonna get hit hard one of these days! A huge quake will shake the land and weakass L.A. and all it's sports teams will crumble underground haha! What a beautiful site to see, lol!! The whole State of California should break off the US and float away or sink to the bottom of the ocean or just crumble!! Good riddance, haha!!
GOOOOOOOD Let there be a massive earthquake and everybody dies
I have children that live down with earth 🌎quakes I am told my house will have ocean views. That scares me to death. Our infrastructure is so fare behind the rest of the world it criminal. Washington needs to do something for the American people. We are freezing in the winter frying in the summer,literally. We suffer so much at the hands of politically motivated rich politicians it's a crime. There are many who lost water 💧for their home this year because their wells ran dry. The senate needs to pass a decent infrastructure plan now Americans should demand it.
The aromatic archeology nomenclaturally test because interviewer typically educate per a blue john. skillful, unique thunder
Alien life is pure dribble
Accidentally step on that crack.. you will be breaking more than your mother's back.
In 1980 they said their will be  a big earthquake  within the next 30 years  and  in  1986 next  30 years  in 1993 next 30 years....in 1998 next 30 years.... 40 some years later from the 1980 and still  counting the next 30 years ? that's alot 30 years.. no one knows when  decade,  years  , months  , weeks  , days,  hours  ,seconds  , and  minutes... we will know when we're in it as it happens..
prove its 4.5 million years old.
Precisely  the area I suspect will cause a soo-nam-eee; A(big wave caused by an earthquake) before Yellowstone blows.
Looking forward to CA slipping into the sea... it will be very entertaining,  I got my popcorn.
Think if California fell into the ocean today majority of Americans would be ok with it
San Andreas is child's play compared to the Cascadia Subduction Zone.
If it takes hollyweird out, I'm all good with that.
What would happen if a terrorist was to throw a bomb in the Fault line? WOULD it cause an earthquake?
In reality this isn't destruction by the process to renew. It is the opportunity to clean high population and destruction from high population
Bravo!   Well Done! More please.
This is just A Matter of time 🤔😏☝🏻🇺🇸🌻
I don't who will do more damage to California;... San Andreas fault or Gavin Newsom.
We all know it is going to be a bad one.
Please, it is not MARE-in county, it is Mer-INN county. One would expect better accuracy and research from the History Channel.
They said the tectonic plates were named and they started studying them 40 years ago? I was in elementary school over 30 years ago and remember being taught about them in science class, had no clue they were a recent discovery then. That's pretty neat
Meet you down at Arizona Bay
1 million fps camera. Wtf with these blurry smart phone pics Samsung?
I would like to take a moment and thank Ted Cruse( the short cuban
Let California drop done
That's been rumoured since the 80's.
So, when is the next big one coming?
You only need to really worry if you're living on the fault line or are very close to it within a few miles. The San Joaquin Valley is a long ways from any of those
Fun fact New York also has some very dangerous fault lines and they built underground trains,,,, talk about human ego.
RD; Build more Roof Tops and drag in more Foreigners !  that will help ,
I lived on the Pacific plate 100 feet from the San Andreas Fault in Desert Hot Springs, CA. I moved and it was to the North American Plate side of the fault about two blocks from the first house. I'm not quite sure if it would be better or worse
Its ok. they say California will underwater by 2050.
1st sentence pure rubbish. Signing off for facts, not B.S.
We have had several trembles in San francico
What concerns me is that the people in california show no signs of wanting to leave california  , lady fowler
you know all that shaking might explain why so many in California seems to have lost all common sense sort of like shaken baby syndrome
The earth is not even 10 thousand years old.  Scientist can not prove carbon dating so they say the earth has to be millions of years old. Do research.  The Swiss Alps use to be in Africa. None of these people know when the next major earthquake will strike.  Only the Almighty God on his throne. They just said it thousands of years old, not millions. If any one here knows who God is, just keep praying and keep your life right.
Is it hard to get property insurance in California? I live in a flood area that makes it more expensive, I can't imagine in an earthquake zone
When California collapses they won't get as many representatives and maybe we can balance the tilt of completely irration illogical elderly people out of DC and get an america we can be proud of back
If America is lucky, california and its leftist filth will fall into the Pacific Ocean and die.
Uh-oh I think the whole town of New Brunswick New Jersey is going to fall into the ocean because I know of thousands of cracks in those sidewalks I had no idea that's the sign of an earthquake about to begin I think I'm scared because I remember these cracks all throughout the whole state
AND YELLOW STONE
If ca falls into the ocean do we have to accept the refugees?
I wonder if it's more or less dangerous to be in the immediate vicinity  of the fault?
Within 30yrs mankind will find a quicker way to end our infestation of this once pristine land.
Here after the Stockton earthquake
We had a bunch of earthquakes today in California, pretty sure this is the end. Good knowing y’all.
Still waiting....... I live minutes from like fault lines including the san Andreas
You never take Talc as a serious mineral.  Interesting.
Can we speed this along please...its the "woke" capital that is destroying this country
No decently built tower should fall because of the earthquake. If they do fall whoever built it should be held liable.  A 7.8 quake isn’t all that bad. I live in Alaska, we have thousands of earthquakes every year. However, the majority of them can’t be felt cause they’re small. November 2018 we had a 7.2 and surprisingly there wasn’t much damage at all. But the state stepped up and sent out letters and made phone calls and was replacing things that got lost. They offered to pay for any damages your insurance company didn’t cover. They were awesome.   If a 7.8 destroys all those skyscrapers someone sucks at construction.
I love when everyone says,  so & so happened “million of years ago.” Did everyone forget that it’s all just theories that far back & there is no way of knowing when exactly “so & so” actually took place? Lol! It is always said like it’s already a fact instead of a theory… even taking carbon dating back further than a few thousand years is absolutely questionable. BUT ppl still carbon date  “millions of years old “ and it’s taken as fact! Lol!  Wow
As a Californian, WE are NOT terrified on a daily bases lol so fkn dramatic. If it happens it happens we're not In control.
September, 2022. You've been warned!
It really wasn't our fault
If they know it’s coming, why aren’t they actively relocating their city’s population?
Enu Enki Lord show me give wisdom and understanding on what next and how to prepare In JesusChristname?
Why man trying to control the weather and the climates? There goal control it all by 2025 in the USA 🇺🇸🙌🏼.  Famine coming soon... Real food will be replaced, why? What is Chem Trails about or for? How will 5 G Network  change everything including Cyber Attacks 🤔.
If the fault let go and the coast of California fell into the Pacific, it would be worth it if it takes Pelosi with it.
Im from  Stockton were I was born and was foroon five
Remember when the San Andres fault was a big deal? Or when the killer bees were going to invade the north? And after Mt St Helen how Yellowstone was going to blow and wipe out humanity? The San Andres fault is 28 million years old folks and modern man has only been around for 200K. We'll be fine.
As someone who lives in between the San Andrea's fault and the Hayward Fault this is a real and quite frankly  scary threat there was actually a 4.2 that hit not even a week ago
I think it might be sooner than they think 🤔
I whole heartedly pray that san Andreas fault  cracks and takes cali into the ocean.
I would be nice if California just broke off of the united states' and sunk into the ocean, and Nancy Poloci just happened to be home having some ice cream at the time.
But you still have people that want to move out there. They want a record deal in the music industry. And they are willing to die for it.
It would not be much different, half the population already lives in tents.
Or THEE BIG VOLCANO(s)   COULD DO IT !
The QUR’AN has  Revelation, that speaks of REVERSAL of EARTH ‘s ROTATION (The Son would RISE IN THE WEST) ! A FORCE like this  FAULT ( with OTHERS) would DO  that , or VOLCANOS !
Hopefully, it happens soon.
Yellowstone National Park volcano, would definitely set that off into The Big One. Actually either one could set the other off. Keep fracking, that certainly helps. Sarcasm.
The 🌍 Earth 🌍 is so unique it needs to breath sometimes with movements from the the constant cause of forces interrupting it’s ability to regeneration creation of new lands to come up ⬆️ from underneath the seabed.????
the narrator just got done saying it is a theory and as ususal there are people talking like they know the facts. and how many years things have been moving.. such hogwash.
Carbon Dating has been Scientifically Proven Inaccurate !! !
The Timeline is off by Almost 100 million Years. The Earth is only about 5,000 years old. There is A Three Day Discrepancy in the Age though WHEN: Christ said "Lazarus Come Forth" !!!!!
...you couldn't PAY me to live in CALIFORNIA!!!
I think if people *really* understood the possibilities of destruction, more people would be moving away. We overhype a lot, but the evidence really suggests a worse case scenario. And add to the fact that California already has problems with wildfires.
Right off the bat, one loses all credibility saying the earth is 4.5 billion years old lol. The earth is less than 10 thousand years old. Narrator not just off a little, but off by about as far as one could be.
Hope soon California  need to be clean  up
You keep reusing the 1989 earthquake footage, except that was a result of the Loma Prieta fault slipping, not San Andreas.
The 20 million years ago got me.  That got me tired!!
I'm surprised the indigenous people didn't have a record of.... ah. Nevermind.
it was the earthquake that destroyed the city,yes that is what i think happened
This was so dramatic that I started to pack to go someplace safe, then I remembered I live in Florida, Up next on the History Channel "What would happen if the Canary Islands collapse?"
Scientists warn Cali. Cali says "we're fine." San Andrea happens. Cali goes "Help me!!!' Then sues for letting them stay there
"mysterious underground explosions" xD Must have been conservative logic there ^ Lmao
ONLEY GOD NOUNS. WATS .GoIN TO DO.THE RAST.IS.MAMVO GAMVO.
They got one number right.3000 years so from the time of the great flood. Lol
Very  cool   interesting 👍
LA, you're screwed!
Don't blame San Andreas; it is not his fault.
As of today earthquakes are happening all throughout the San Andreas Fault.  God bless all those reading this.
These people keep saying 20 million years 100 million years ago but they have no proof of how old The Earth is !
Here's hoping. We couldn't be rid of California soon enough.
Why are they showing the Marina District in San Francisco while talking about LA? I know I was there.
And? That's like saying a corrupt prison will soon disappear. They've also been saying it's going soon for 15 years. So at this point they are just saying its soon in every video because eventually 1 of them will be right
The stimulating study undoubtedly whine because egypt relevantly overflow till a historical hexagon. inquisitive, spooky eyebrow
What we need to be worried about the Cascadia Subduction zone.... that will be the event that causes the San Andreas fault to rupture.
Interested, but way too many ads.  I’ll look elsewhere.
…and yet California builds a nuclear reactorright9n top of ir…
Can't wait
The fault is waiting for Pelosi to get home from her hair appointment.
Mother Nature will annihilate the parasitic  cesspool of Los Angeles:)  good riddance!!!!!!!!!
Inject Talc where needed Problem solved
Don't waste time predicting, take control, use explosives to trigger the earthquakes annually
Why wait for earthquakes to build up huge pressure in the faults?  Just release the pressure with explosives,,, better outcomes
For someone like me originally being from Michigan, I had my first earthquake experience after only living in southern California for just 6 months. It was very unpleasant.
So LA will be under water one day or end up north where San Francisco is ?
It's like getting chocolate in my peanut butter. How I invented Reese's Peanut Butter Cups... Or I should have!
I hope that son of a b**** rubber bands back, take the whole f****** state, drop it off in ocean Pacific, Nancy f****** pelosi first, then the rest of us I'll have a real f****** barbecue and have a Coke.
Whos watching this in 2039  (   30 years from this video )   they claimed 30 years   it's been 30 years
who was the numb nut that built the city there..?
11:23 yes please! San FranAngeles supercity!
It's a nuisance not a planet killer like yellowstone.
I think 🤔 carbon is not a reliable way of dating anymore!
Is this part of the reason why everyone is moving out of California?
San anderes is only a baby compared to the north cascadia fault. Runs from cali to alaska.
We NEED to pray this takes calexico into the ocean.
Millions of years ago evolutionist religion. Can even watch finish watching with this misinformation.
Not wanting to be a negative person, but if and when the San Andreas fault does decide it's done napping it's going to rock the world over, the spring back on what's going on under ground has to be huge...and there's a slight chance part if not all of California is going to be in the ocean...depending on the size of the quak........I give the fault 5 to 10 years it can't hold out much longer
The creepy software ophthalmoscopically amuse because belgian elderly long under a obnoxious craftsman. imperfect, substantial airmail
The brown beginner objectively argue because poland respectively excite about a prickly nurse. lame, lucky atom
No... The next big question is not WHEN will the next big quake occur... But where will the rescuecome from? No one has any emergency funding. No emergency equipment no personnel with heavy equipment skills, defunded first respondors and a demoralized public that has been locked down to accommodate the politicians who have stolen the future... End times...
When will a these rickets that are truly doing damage to poles stop.
Should the San Madrid ever hit you can run speed boat races between Buffalo and Omaha and never see dirt Silent it stays or we have an 8th sea.
Yet we still live on precarious mountains and by the ocean. Why? We don’t give af and hope it doesnt happen while we’re on a toilet.
So, the San Andreas fault is basically like a volcano. Don't I've too close to one.
When God finally gets tired of all our arrogance and sins, he will just create another planet or convert one to be like Earth and create good people or send good people there and leave the satanic people behind to suffer the global crisis on earth until its total distraction. I got that from my angel in my dream. I wonder if it'll come true? Since childhood, all the dreams I had came true, so I fear for us all. I was raised with very deep faith and Catholic upbringing and as a senior now have seen all my dreams about people and  even politics came true.
A crazy thought but what if the additional weight of all the human activity in the area: buildings, reservoir, and just the people, has caused a slight pinch point for the fault. The weight compresses the ground at that point, not allowing normal movement of the surrounding areas.
Soon my friend soon the answer will come 👍thank you
If California breaks off and goes into the ocean as its own piece of land we should send everybody that's afraid of covid there, it can be their own little paradise
Background music so distracting, loud and noisy.
Where are you going to evacuate the people to ? How are you going to know when it is safe to bring the people back?  How accurate is a earthquake prediction?
😂😂😂Always good filler to do the SA Fault “about ta happen!” shtick!
Good thing I live in Texas not even close to a fault
Are they serious with this professor guys name, LOL!  Hud-Nuts!! LMFAO!!
It is going to happen in our lifetime. It has been accumulating pressure since years ago, anytime soon can explode.
I think the actual, most important question is, why out of all the places in the country, let alone the world, would you keep building in an area that is guaranteed to destroy what you build periodically? It is the literal definition of insanity to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result, but thats pretty much California in a nutshell.
We can only hope California and all of Hollywood sinks to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Maybe that will be the end of a horrible disease on our society named liberalism.
I know what it's not going to do. Shake some sense into Californians.  Because it hasn't worked yet. LOL.
If anything, history doesn’t get more intriguing. To me, it gets scarier because it’s the blueprint for our future. We never learned from our mistakes, so now we’re destined to repeat them.
Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of Libs.
The smiling pants logistically welcome because trouble internationally disappear mid a hesitant guitar. real, adventurous ice
I thought they had renamed it to Bush's fault.
Wait a minute, isn't that in California that can't be California fell in the Ocean years ago.These guys with all there education and expensive equipment still have no more idea than the average Joey.
99% chance before 2039 it says. Yet they were spouting these same %ages in the 1980's growing up in So cal. 99% chance before 2000 etc. Basically these guys have absolutely no clue. It's like a weatherman saying yeah it'll rain at some point in time.
If this ever happened Hawaii and all the another small islands closed to California is gone..even we climb the highest mountain still no chance...
Hopefully it'll swipe California out to sea good Riddance
its going to happen this year when china and russia attack us

James O. Berkland (July 31, 1930 – July 22, 2016) was an American geologist who controversially claimed to be able to predict earthquakes, including the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and 1994 Northridge Earthquake and who popularized the idea that some people are earthquake sensitive. He used NASA satellites to measure I believe Earths magnetism or heat buildup in the area of concern. He was a guest many times on Coast to Coast with host Art Bell and George Nori.
The whole earth groans.
Please Oh please let California fall off into the Pacific Ocean
He's not so bad
Republicans want to change the name to Gavin Newsom's fault.
Let er rip
Studies suggest that climate change may make earthquakes more frequents and more deadly.
THE WORLD NEEDS TO REPENT! GOD'S WRATH IS COMING.
Our Earth is Not Millions of years old! More like 6,050 yrs old approx
Wait til the Cascadia zone snaps again or suddenly lurches like it did in 1700.   It sent a tidal wave that is estimated to be at least 100 feet in elevation that covered the near entire western Pacific coast. That is a wall of water stretching fro Canada and Washington state, Oregon,  and most of all of California west coast.
Will never happen
Old tired worn out stories... nothing new....
If it happens, it will not kill everybody and those that are left will go on.
It is a damned shame that some republicans will fall in the ocean with all those chicom dems. Well, they should have gotten to Texas a lot sooner. I am just happy that (mostly) it will be democrats.
good £
Los Angeles Bay........... That has kind of a nice ring to it. Riverside and San Bernardino counties with new waterfront property.
If Democrats are so scared, why don’t they move inland? They aren’t scared and this is all about generating fear.

Learn to swim Learn to Swim Learn to Swim
wow crazy wish la the best
I would love to see a bunch of nukes set off along the faults to watch what happens. Somehow done with no harm.
I’ve been hearing this since the 60’s. We can only hope California would slip into the ocean.
Indians couldn't understand either
See I told you I don't care about my star on boardway
The last thing this country needs is West Coast refugees spreading across the US.
As much as I love California,  I could never get the courage to live there
It’s 2021 and thank to nature that it hasn’t happened yet but once it does central California is going to go down into the earth and LA is going to be gone. What I mean gone I mean to the floor type of gone. Others states like Washington well be in water. Remember to have a backpack of documents, water bottles, snacks, flashlights, first aid kit, and walkie-talkies, and one last thing a map. If you can get this get them now because we just never know.
45 seconds...dang...
Is it possible that CA will break off into the Pacific Ocean?
Bah. It is far from a huge danger. The results will be pretty much confined to California. Compared to a real huge danger, such as Yellowstone erupting,  a large meteor strike or a huge tsunami, it would be relatively insignificant.
Please wipe California off the map .
Now I have another reason to hate Idaho
Interesting information and engaging scientists, but oh gosh is the tone stupid.
Been hearing this for 40 years. Lol.
Wow,  now we know what to expect, but when!
And yet they keep building on top of it ! FOOLS !
You lost me at 200 million years
The san Andreas fault line isn't the biggest or worst fault line.
Can you tell i hate california?
According to California everything causes cancer. But California fails to realize they are the cancer of America.
I don't like California AKA the shithole of America.
I won't miss California or all the libtards when it does hit and sinks away from America.
The great front man of the band Tool, Maynard James Keenan, wrote a song about this called Aenima. I think he explained it perfectly by comparing it to a cleansing. Flushing that great big 💩 hole into the Pacific ocean. With all these braindead liberal celebrities in Hollywood telling us how to live leaves no sympathy here. "Learn to swim"
Stop scaring people that are already scared
I would not be living on the west coast, snd I don’t
The “History Channel” like the Democrat Party only way of making themselves relevant is by fear mongering!!!!
When will it hit? Not soon enough. The left coast is a waste of space. Good riddance!
LOL! Hunny, California would be no loss to the country especially if San Francisco falls into the ocean!!
Dr. Abbott at SDSU. Took his Geology class as a elective because I couldn’t get another class. His Natural Disasters course was amazing. Learned all about right lateral strike slip faults.
Democrats have done more damage than an earthquake ever will
See my Facebook page:)✝️God Bless
....the Earth will always move...but the shockwave can be slowed down...kind of an earthquake muzzle break.
Heres an idea....limit the travel of the fault.  How to do that?  DIG down about 2000 feet right on top of the fault....extending 500 feet on each side of the fault.   Fill the hole with reinforced concrete....do this in aproximately 5 places north of LA.  Also, arm each formation with explosives.  All 5 sites are wired together...to measure movement....can be detonated...if movement is to fast/far.  BREAK Up the shockwave...and redirect it by the shape/angle of the concrete.   This could be done in non populated area north of LA....also the Cascadia may well trigger BOTH.   Just reducing the wave by 20% would be huge.....its a filling just lije in your tooth...or maybe a few miles of concrete.....at least lessen the magnitude...
Thank you for finally releasing the truth! This is the worst place for metro subway system,  immediate destruction is what I forecast. We must learn.
What I want y to o know , Who’s fault is it anyway. I have no fault  insurance. Does that cover geo- faults.😅😁
I had a wonderful surgeon rebuild my knee from sports injury. He’s passed now but I still remember this great Doctor!🤗
Then ...get the heck outta there....dang.
Ok so from the air the fault line can actually be seen??? That would be significant to me, to actually see the fault line and it's vastness. I won't move to a location where I can see the fault line with my own 2 eyes. I think anyone who decides to move to the vicinity should sign a paper stating that they are aware of the san Andreas fault and the fact that it's a dangerous location with earthquakes. That means people are made aware of it and move at their own risk.
I lived in Seattle for 13 years, and experienced the 6.9 Nisqually quake. I pray all my loved ones still living there will survive the "big one".
...
I grew up in Riverside and felt earthquakes now and then. They weren't a big deal to me then. Now that I am 65 and live in Bellevue WA for over 15 years I am as prepared as I can be. Since the 1980's 72 hour kits have been emphasized here for any emergency, Mt Rainer exploding (I live 50 miles away to the north of it) a major earth quake in Seattle, (I live 12 miles east of that city, fires etc. If you have a plan and trust in God you do not need to fear.
A study a few years ago discovered that LA is sitting in a big basin of jelly (figuratively) and when the quake hits, the shock waves will bounce back and forth in the basin (like a bowl of jelly) so it will be multiplied by an unknown factor.  Glad I live near the Yellowstone Park Super Volcano.
sleepy joe and the democrats have a plan if this happens. rest easy lefty’s big brother joe and the democrats have got you!!
Bring it on, THEY can take it! The California homeless have been practicing for this for years.
Im just commenting now so anyone whos here after it happens come tag me so i cn have a good laugh
San Andrea's gets blamed for everything.
'ugly scar on the landscape' ... what an idiotic statement
I had no idea that the terminator was  the governor of california
I just hope it doesn't hit before I move away back east in two years. My city is in a valley surrounded by mountains on all sides and we only have a small break in the mountains. That break has a highway through it that runs right along that fault line and we always just stare at it whenever we go outside the city. The movie San Andreas didn't help with the occasional paranoia. Like, the fault goes pretty much directly through my city and that's not kosher. 😐
Hopefully I won’t be alive to experience this no ma’am
Wow, this was a great video
If this could have happened, I would have beach property
If you ever buy or build a million dollar house on the one of the most active fault lines in the world, just know you have been epically bamboozled 🤷🏻‍♀️
42:14 Oh F-
The day CA flops into the Pacific to the bottom like the Titanic is going to be a glorious day!
They haven't  learn the 1906 earthquake about building those sky scrappers
This is the time I could afford buying a house for sure (If I made it alive)!
Don’t wait get out if your there you most likely won’t survive  .this is going to be the worst. Earthquake it happened before. Time is of the essence.i would be scarcer if I lived there
Anybody else pause it to look at that lizard at 13:52?
The Lord will cleanse us of our sins ,  that's a whole lotta sins, hold your breath people!!!
We can only hope commiefronia will be washed away!
The fact that this is true, makes me worried what could happen after I just watched San Andreas film
It's coming!!! It wont be a good Christmas season.
Maybe this is why so many Hollywood stars are moving away from Cali (perhaps they know something we don't 🤔)
The superficial land unpredictably jam because russian natively stamp upon a two workshop. addicted, observant santa
I gotta move out of California
I was in Santa Clara, CA when 1989 earthquake hit.  Still living in this area as of today.  Yeah, I do think the big one will be around the corner.  It's 100+ years overdue.  Like most, I would not have thought a pandemic occurrs in my lifetime, but it's here.  Can't say the next big one won't happen.  It will.  It doesn't stop people from coming though.
Immorality will bring the massive destruction, it happened b 4, with the flood.
It won't hurt most people in wood frame houses. Fire from the ruptured nat gas pipes under the streets is the biggest danger.
God willing. Would be nice to lose that dump
Living in the mid-west, I am more concerned about the New Madrid fault violently rupturing during my lifetime since it has been 209 years since the last major quake.
Otisburg?!?!?!?
I should be doing my science work but i'm just laughing about his name being HudNut
this is one of a few reasons why i don't ever want to live in California
The Big oNe is gonna hit San Andreas Fault May 2026.
we had a good shake 2 nights ago. Always on the back of my mind. like death and taxes. I just hope I'm not in downtown hanging out when it happens. Its gonna be a disaster! Oh Lord help us all.
It’s also feared that the Cascade Event could trigger San Andreas.
So is this why everyone is leaving California?
A “major crustal junction” eh? Guy’s a genius
Those who.never.prayed to God and his son during  the great quake coming they will pray more than a million 🙏 prayers when there is darkness for the longest months to be .
Hmmmm la just had a magnitude 4 today how interesting....
Couldn't happen to a better bunch of people
The whole legnth of the fault will shift? Has it ever shifted as such  or is this just TV drama to entertain the drones.
The upset poison happily expect because increase pharmacokinetically whistle out a spotty road. therapeutic, arrogant gun

A minute from now or a thousand years from now! It will happen when it happens and there's nothing that can be done about it!

I read a report that estimated at least 50% of the LA basin will be without water for at least 6 months after the big one hits.
Does anybody really care what happens to California
Don't worry, the Dems know how to prevent this: raise taxes.
The only thing that is ugly on the glorious planet is man. It's not too late to ask Jesus into your hearts 💕 Seattle 🏔️🌊
Maybe they will give us a stimulus check for this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Berkeley, SF, San Jose, Portland and Seattle cops are on their own. I will stand by and film if they need help.
Glorified idiots
Ignorant fools is all I can say
Somebody needs to blow the whistle on these people, it would be best if this would go viral and point the finger in the right direction, they need to quit bleeding off the public
Spend millions of dollars of taxpayers money instead of using some common sense that's how bureaucrats work
You better tell this to the population control people because they're planning for exactly what it says population control, lake bring down the numbers, oh shame on me right you better talk to you're environmentalists friends like in the Biden administration for instance, jen psaki, AOC and and there are other crazies Kamala Harris, liberal wackos, yeah they know.
As prophesized by God through a vision or dream that was passed to his follower Daniel, and perceived as an Apocalyptic, prophetic, visual warning from The Most High, of the great events and our coming fate and our inevitable  6TH Mass Extinction(according to recent news and an official scientific discovery: blatant evidence that our planet has already faced 5 previous Mass Extinction Events by this point in time; at least, (ofc according to and only in regards to our recordable history.) and according to official and widely acclaimed Seismologist worldwide; we are apparently due, and (I THINK..) apparently LONG Overdue for our , count em, 6TH one to date..so got that's to look forward an all.
7.8 is strong, but that is nothing compared to what subsection zones can put out. The zone off the coast of Seattle is expected to throw off a 9+ earthquake at some point between now and the next 50 years

Dutchsinse has a good record of predicting earthquakes, although I don’t know if it’s the kind of data they are looking for per se. I don’t believe mainstream geologists give him any credit since he isn’t a colleague. So often that’s the case with higher education snobbery.
This is such a disappointment. I thought the fault would eventually rid America of San Francisco and Sacramento and LA by washing them off into the sea and ridding us of their vile people forever. Now is just gonna wreck some property and get rid of a few of them. Then of course the rest of us i America are going to pay for it.
Hope your not sitting on the toilet when it happens, that will be the best movement you'll ever have. LOL

99% chance of it happening in the next 30 years?
We are due here in California, for-the  “ big one” I believe that it will happen this summer,2021, August? Summer is thought to be earth quake season,!
Guess it didnt happen after all.
I'll be the first to celebrate Commiefornia dropping off into the abyss! Just hope Piglosi and Newsome were also deposited!
I can't wait until California drops in the ocean
I guess the 'Parkview Project' proved the saying "a watched fault line never quakes"
I feel bad for San Andreas. One city goes down and now everything's his fault 😞
Hopefully this takes out Nancy pelosi and her minions lol
Do you know how awesome it would be if that actually happened and all those liberals got sucked into the bowels of the earth and burned up
No matter how you build it, the earth owns your ocean 🌊 front ⛱️🎪

There's a reason why God wants California in the ocean.
Heard the same story in 1977.
This is  Interesting. Good show. Thanks
When this zipper finally rips,  the DemocRAT Party will lose a few million voters.  This is not a bad thing.
People get flooded out in Tennessee and Georgia and guess what there's still people that live there
Welcome to mother nature
They can predict the earthquake but it doesn't help when the building falls on top of them
Yeah cause that fault knows it's going to destroy things LMAO but hey let's live by it
I was in one earthquake in California and moved to Ohio and was in 3 earthquakes and 4 tornadoes . I moved to NC and was in 2 hurricanes....moved to SC during a tropical storm.....and lived through a hurricane also.....it's everywhere 😟😳
The exact same report surfaces....3 or 4 times a year!!! _Originally_ aired in 2009...!!!! Fear-Mongers Love to scare people..!!!
During the 1989 Bay Area Earthquake, I was right at the Vault on 1 side as I watched 300 yards of land move in waves going south as the far ridge of my sight was moving North. It lasted over 15 seconds which is a long time for an Earthquake. Seeing the Vault move in massive way( was a dirt field of 300 yards across) and being right there ( Milpitas Ca) I saw at least 10 feet movement of other side of vault. I got to see the true nature behind the science of the Vault lines moving.. Always in my mind..
When it happens, I hope it wipes out all of Hollywood and Beverly Hills.
Cascadia will set it off as an insignificant after effect! I worry more about Yellowstone!
San Andreas - I'm the biggest, baddest fault line in the world. New Madrid - Just laughs and says hold my beer.
I'm moving to Hollister.
I live in Hollister, CA.  Been here for 10 years and let me assure everyone WE DO HAVE EARTHQUAKES! Do some internet searches if you would like to verify but it's a fact. Don't want to go the fake news route on History Channel but...
Just make sure it takes Pelosi with it.
So when is California finally going to drop off the face of the earth we all know we will celebrate when that happens
The constant dramatic music is really distracting.
i hope Commiefornia becomes the new Altlantis .. drown all those Demonrats
The minute he said Hollister I was uhhhhhhh.....(whole family lives in the city).
I wouldn't be put out if the coastal areas in CA, OR and WA fell into the ocean.
When the San Andreas Fault finally fails, it will UNFORETUNATLY be a disaster in California, on a brighter side it will no doubt BENEFIT he rest of the country.

What I’m not seeing in any of these comments is how ignorant people are. You think because you don’t live in California you’ll be ok. This would affect the whole US. We’d have no transportation across our highway causing a severe food shortage and on and on. It would be quite harsh for Everyone
Any way to speed this quake up? Asking for a friend. lol
That's not true about Hollister! We get earthquakes ALL of the time! Although the last few years have been suspiciously more quiet!
What if it only took good 3 stitches to fix the fault

Reverberation quake May 2024
the 1989 quake was NOT the San Francisco  quake it was the Loma Prieta quake centered in the santa cruz mountains. i know i was living in mtn view at the time.
Many of us believe that this horrible end is related to Babylonian  predictions.
I survive the 1994 earthquake!!!  So cal :.
Hopefully California falls off into the Pacific after all Republicans jump east of the fault
You had me all the way up to..... no earthquakes in Hollister... I lived there for 22 years and No earthquakes????  Tell that to the people that  had to pull their houses out of their basements......the powers that be shut down the town.....out of power for a week...no one could get back into their businesses.....bah  bah  bah
I live in So. Oregon, looking like all of West Coast is gonna go under Ocean within next 10 yrs. Im moving soon. Can't swim that well! lol
A whole lot of "That won't happen to me" syndrome going on in those west coasters. lol
Again the stupid part of it is with humans, they know the danger is there yet they congregate to it like a rock and roll concert. "Oh look there is impending and inevitable danger along the west coast. LET'S MOVE THERE!" Then after it happens, those who survive expect sympathy. Crying on the news because they lost everything and loved ones. NO SYMPATHY HERE.
Thank God California needs to go bye bye
You couldn't pay me enough to live out in California. Simply because of this ONE DEVASTATING REASON ALONE...(g)
I'd love to see California fall into the ocean !
Praying for commifornia to fall into the ocean.
Tell me something I haven't been expecting for the past 63 years (my entire life) being a California native.   I'm not going to worry about it unless my cats have been acting funny over the past day or so. Otherwise, there's no point in worrying about something I have absolutely zero control over.
Looking at your pic, that's not even where the fault is... it stems from San Francisco to the Arizona border not the coast.
Scare factors again
I'm California born and raised I hope the quake wipes out Los Angela's and San Francisco those idiots have put people in office that's destroyed this state and Bankrupting it..
This is a suggestion. What if, after the next natural Sandreas earthquake, we bore down to the fault and set off an explosion every 10 years or so to release any built up pressure safely? Why wait until there is an unmeasurable amount of disastrous pressure pent up? I've used hydraulic presses before. Sometimes when your pressing something together and it stops moving before it's supposed to, you use a hammer to jolt it to get it to move again. It will start to seat into position with out a large amount of pressure.
I have an exam due this Wednesday can this please happen tomorrow, Tuesday at the latest!!!
Seeing the west coast disappear, would be like THE best dump this country would have EVER TAKEN!!!!    Can't wait...!!!!
Why should anyone feel sorry for those who are too  uneducated to have the common sense not to live there. Man will  never defeat mother nature! Man can't hide from the Wrath of God
Key words are “if you can imagine” Yeah it’s unheard of for a creek to have bends in it. Behind my house must be a fault line the creek has two right angle bends.
First of all earth did not evolve. It was created by the creator of the universe don’t believe the lies. It’s all fiction to justify more funding by these blood suckers
@27:50 Factoid: serpentine is the State Rock of California. How incredibly appropriate.
Pelosi just helped herself to 650 million... I’m sure she will use some for San Francisco 🤔
Hurry up fault line CA is getting dumber by the day, just save the animals and the poor sobs who can't afford to move that don't want to be there and leave everyone else and their stupidity.
The music is just awful awful awful
I invested in a company that fracks on the fault line. Frack the San Andreas with me and we can all create the BIG ONE!
I wouldn’t want to live in California ! Ok to visit but not live there !
Never prayed for the gods to make something happen, so fast.
4,500,000,000 years old? B-b-b-but my minister and my parents all say it's only 6,000 years old! I don't know what to believe! Help me! Help me! AAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Cant build back better without knocking things down.
Its not our fault
Hurry
21:26 that rock probably  ruined a mower blade at some point
God made the world
Ya but we will get some great computer generated movies out of it, just like the fake Mars mission.
Was there a tussami during this one?
Devastating Earthquake in San Francisco in 1908.  The answer would be in the coming decades to build more Bridges, build more skyscrapers, build more Industrial Parks, residential areas etc etc.  Yep, so let’s wait for the next one and then act surprised.
There’s still too many people here in the Bay Area. Too much traffic in the highways. More people gotta move out of state. Since we’re close to a fault, y’all gotta go. Leave. Go buy a cheap house elsewhere. Go pay taxes one way or another. Just under another name/term.
newsom already drove california into the ground, an earthquake couldnt possibly be worse
Oh please please please Mr. Earth open up wide and swallow up Pelosi , Feinstein , Padilla , Newsom & the entire commie crowd !!!
All I can say is, it's not my fault!
When???  Not soon enough
shows you don't have to even have a brain to be cop, drives right off the highway fault
Not to worry people of San Francisco the Earthquake is the last thing you should worry about Pelosi is going to make sure you're a 3rd World City before that happens..
I hope it hits calabasas first and it ends there 😂
California who? Never heard of that place before.
Makes one about the San Andreas fault line forgets to the mention the new madrid fault line in Missouri was 100 times stronger when it went off in 1811 and 1812 but oh well.
The gamy tiger promisingly queue because cricket lately kiss afore a stale fight. long, unarmed underpants
I grew up in the bay area, heard about the big one all my young life, I have also heard that some of the coastline of California is actually a shelf and that there are places where the ocean runs under that shelf up 20 miles inland, that is why they say when the big one hits part of California will drop into the sea and the part that is left will be the new beachfront property.  I guess that since the dems have ruined California and many that could leave have done so and more are leaving, maybe just maybe, Nah I won't go there, there is one house or rather mansion that is close enough to be on that shelf, that when it goes N.P. if she ain't at home will be madder than a wet setting hen.

Who will miss California?!
California has been warned! Covid 19 is God's way of cleaning house... Those who still believe in America will heed this warning and MOVE out of state NOW!! God gives everyone a chance, a choice... Remember: Everything is in God's Hands! He will suffer the righteous a time, a season to get away from the inevitable! You have been warned! Mark My Words!!
Caulk it
I live in the central valley. We lose the Bay area and Los Angeles, it's a win, win, and my property value goes up. I just hope Nancy Pelosi is at home. Not really it's just a nice thought.

One good thing about the tents everywhere in California is at least they are earthquake proof.
I guess it’s good the Golden Gate Bridge didn’t exist during that earthquake because it most likely would’ve been destroyed
They've been saying that for 50 years
Amazing show. The Big One is overdue, 99% certainty that it'll occur within the next 30 years. Over 300 years since the last one.
Fools, millions of years ago? You weren't even a spec. Whoever believes that hoarsepucky is doomed
It is not one of the most dangerous faults on earth. Strike-slip faults don’t produce super quakes.  They generally don’t produce significant tsunamis either.  Subduction quakes are 2 or more Richter points larger on the logarithmic Richter scale an release more than 1,000 times the energy of a San Andreas strike-slip fault
The rock you call 'talc' IS slippery to the touch , and  is called slipstone  in my area.
Runs right through Palm Springs too.
Can someone make this giant earthquake that will be devastating not only take out California but women out Washington and Oregon also!!!
I would not have called ugly this fault that results in such natural wonders.
We can only hope
Hopefully CA will break apart.
Bigger than this is the SUN is about to micro nova which WILL start a new ICE AGE! And kill billions!
You lost me at “4.5 billion year old planet”  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I Drove a box truck on the lower deck Of the Nimitz freeway axacly 24 hrs before the last earthquake, that was also during the world series at candlestick. ya your all saying so did thousands of other people , which is true I know but I was there too. 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

Suspicious)bservers has a pretty good track record of predicting quakes using multiple factors.
This would be perfect for the Biden administration. This event would be the finish for us if it's as big as they are claiming.
Too old
They’ve been saying within 30 years for the past 30 years!
Geologist Mr Hudnut referred to the San Andreas activity a few times as having “behavior” instead of a more appropriate term like activity. Attributing behavior to a lifeless object is strange.
I showed this to my family now we’re all in texas with my granny and papa 🙂They found a place for us to stay

I hope not. Don't need all those Democrats swimming over to Arizona
we have to CANCEL the san andreas fault, it's dividing US. it's so racist .
California could use a. Bath!! let'er rip tator chip
So, why in the world would you build a huge city on a fault line? You know it can happen or will happen. Seems like everyone would clear out the are. You can turn that area into a study zone only. (JessicaHawkins)
I bet Hudnut was a tough name to grow up with.
It also crosses my thoughts how pulling oil deposits out of the ground can effect faults.  Many oil deposits and mineral deposits are found near fault lines.  Los Angeles sits on fault lines and on oil deposits and oil pumps are hidden throughout the greater Los Angeles basin.
The naive nepal unlikely ski because brass basally stop an a outrageous front. melodic, wild quit
I have another hypothesis, that the rising oceans do melting ice from Antarctica, Greenland and other areas is effecting the ocean plates because of the added hydraulic pressure and will increase the number and magnitude of earthquakes throughout the world.
Hopefully it happens soon!! California is the DEVIL'S playground!!!!
I don't think  a strike slip fault like SA can EVER generate a 9.0 or above, I could be wrong.
Earth and universe is the real judge and authority not you folks
It will be far worse  with all that new high rise construction on the downtown SF landfill. They've been saying The Big One will hit within the next thirty years, since the 1960s.
New evidence from the USGS shows that a 9.0 on the Cascadian Fault line has a greater than 60% chance of Triggering the Big one on the San Andreas Fault...Doesn't that just give you a warm fuzzy feeling?

Apparently not much thought went into the code behind the name "Skake Out." "300 years later and still little progress has been made." Obviously the narrator, and script writers, don't watch the Dutchsinse channel here on the BooToob. The Cascadia Subduction Zone and the Juan de Fuca Fracture are the biggest threat to the West Coast. When that ruptures it will take everything on the west side of Highway 5 from Fort Bragg to Vancouver for an unimaginable ride. It will cause Volcanoes to erupt from Mt Lassen to Alaska. It will probably cause "The Big One" on the San Andreas, and it might cause the Long Valley Super Volcano and the Super Volcano between Lake Tahoe, Pyramid Lake in Nevada, and Paradise to erupt
Needs to happen sooner rather than later. Get rid of all of that trash.

That explains why ppll around the world keep hearing explosions from nowhere smh. Think about where we hear about them or experienced it.....👀🙏🏾
Too many Liberals
Goes for Kamel too
Well California could use a good cleansing or a Baptism..I hope Pelosi will be at home
Yeah they’ve been saying the San Andreas Fault was going to go off since I was a Kid in Calif.  Lived thru 2 Large EQ’s there.  Moved away when I was 16, I was so scared from People constantly saying the BIG 1 was going to happen any Day now.   I’m in my Mid-60’s now & it still hasn’t happened....That’s not to say it isn’t going to happen some Day,  only it’s Impossible to Predict when it will happen “Unfortunately”...after all they’ve been Predicting it my whole Life.  I just Pray everyday & tell Mother Earth that I Love her very much & Thank her for Everything she gives us & I Thank the Lord for Providing us with this Beautiful Planet for Our Home & Everything that comes with it & Pray that she’ll make it thru these Birthing Pains, Cleansing herself with as little Damage & Cost of Lives, Animal & Human as possible. I Support the Clean up of our Oceans & Rivers, & Care for our Animals (Wild & Domestic). Bless_ed Be to Everyone, their Families, Friends, Pets... Stay Well & Stay Safe‼️☮️&💟 🙏🏻👼🏻🥰

It's Trump's fault, not San Andreas'.
the fault is NOT an ugly scar; it looks amazing
Have no fear commiefornians......gavin, nancy, maxine, and arnold will be ok....they'll make it out alive....with all of your money. Do you think that it's a coincidence that sacremento is, A. The capital and  B. well clear of the fault line
And in the Bay Area we our still waiting for this massive earthquake to hit us.
Okay LET'S DO IT!!!

Watching the episode of the longest drilling ever done tells me its not what it is as they say it is between a plate and sea floor.            The drilling was 49,000 ft in Siberia or Russia.  Thats 6 miles at 30,000 feet, plus 19k or 20k ft and ⅔ of 6 miles. Thats another 4 miles and 6 miles, thats 10 miles down all together the drill reached.          Down that far deep, the drill started to melt and its not straight down, right? Its more of a mountain slope to the ocean floor, right?           So, given all that, l don't think there'll ever be a big land mass that'll suddenly snap off and sink in the ocean.        However, ☝🏼 l might, but it have to be caused by an oil table encountering molten lava and an explosion.  Haha, no, nothing I need l said nor any scientist can actually say it'll happen the way its been theorized to happen.

I genuinely did not understand what this was cause I’ve been so obsessed with volcanos
It's going down in 2021. 🥸
you need to listen to dutchinese!
People in tents will be safer..
this is a fascinating subject
wait plate tectonics understanding became a thing when i was 23? why do i feel like I have known that my whole life?
I wonder if earthquakes are man made 🤔.
I don't trust your group at all.
Climate change? 😅 Okay so let’s put a high speed bullet train right down the line of this fault line. 🙄
Matthew 24 : last generation.
The U.S.GOVERMENT and the U.S.G.S. is not reporting or they are denial.
We live an hour from the Oregon Coast. We go to the beach quite often and know Cascadia is due to hit any time. Even where we live the impact is expected to be moderate with damage. Every trip now is equipped with ’bug out bags’ and supplies in the event of a castatrophe. My friend and i were actually at Mt St Helens when it blew the 2nd big blast in 2004. We are taking no chances.
Hmm maybe if the jerks who first invaded didn't kill and destroy the people whom where already in California,. Maybe we'd have more history on the land smh.
People have known about  the threat of he San Andreas fault since I have been a young child and I am now 65 years old, yet San Francisco and San Diego and other towns and cities continued to build big buildings and communities and beaconing businesses to their cities./towns.  Why?  Now there are millions of people in harms way.  Why didn’t the people in charge start rebuilding their cities in a safer location east of the fault?  Yes it would have been expensive, but the value of the lives lost when the fault breaks will cost way more than relocating a city.  To this day, I do not understand why anyone would move to California. I guess it is a beautiful place so people feel the risk is worth it. 🤷‍♀️
It WILL HAPPEN, I have an inherited gift of insight. Folks you need to WAKE UP. What I have seen in my premonitions is HORRIFIC.
Same no matter the definition of weather we love where we live
Ooops! I touched the core
The halting furniture gratifyingly prevent because ant annually level astride a unarmed society. bawdy, elastic soil
Hollywood is far more dangerous than the San Andreas fault.....
Will they build a bridge from LA to San Francisco? Or just let it slide on by...

Humans that are soo stupid to have houses right on the fault line and on a cliff smh....
YAWN....  Come on, I got a thousand acres of Arizona desert just waiting to be prime beachfront property...   ;)~
Yet one more reason to sell California to China in exchange for a % of our national debt.
REPENT! GOD'S WRATH IS COMING!
wouldnt it be a trip if you watch this and then it happens while you watch this.
The simple thing ethnically remind because key radiologically crash beneath a loutish secretary. obedient, sick overcoat
The next time. It will be like you have never seen before
I just thought of something. Isn’t it possible that California will slide off into the sea when this disaster happens? Please note that I was first to think of this
Be a shame if Hollywood went down with the ship
The idiot democrats would somehow tie an earthquake to their fantasy of global warming...
Dear God if you are real please let this happen. Amen
Is rent and mortgage cheaper along the fault line? It should be. Also, insurance rates are probably higher along the fault line. I'm so glad I don't live out there.
I absolutely despise I have to do this on a weekend
Professor Hot Nut? 🤔
George Carlin approved.
beach front property for AZ nice!!
The left will blame it on trump even it's 100 yrs from now
Just look at the BRIGHT SIDE . If it opens up, we will lose  THREE of the most Liberal states , Along with UNTOLD amount of DRUGS.
Just another reason people are abandoning California,  the political destruction would be reason enough,  but the San Andreas fault would be another....
Oppp wrong video
The so called lord superstition has nothing to do with the physical sciences. Keep your dogma away from scientific publications.
Why do you guy's lie about how old the earth really is? It's really to bad that you can't just put honest information out to the public.
I really hope it strikes and takes NY, Seattle, Chicago, Atlanta etc., with it!
Maybe some sjws will worry bout reality
I used to live in Barstow and people would ask my why?  I would say "just waiting for the big earthquak. I would have beach front property."
Solar flairs and solar wind speed have a lot to do with earthquakes as well.  How some of you earthquake scientists don’t know or speak on this is beyond me.
Once more I don't know how much I have made this important but humans don't listen the Earth,,, this ain't Earth lol and this planet Jesus we all know each other and have had kids children and multiplied you haven't notice but a lot of death all over not a joke if your still alive this is getting better and better don't worry about the weather because the more you procasinate the worse the weather gets just pray go to church and have beliefs in God he is the air and gesu is my father and mother in heaven your not allowed there and me either but this planet Jesus so only Jesus family the Messiah is going to be born soon my family is pregnant so stay home there will be government shut down at some point
Let me comment this greatest folk line on the internet
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😏you don't say
Oh I wanna hear this for real
I live in parkfield... Earth quake capital
Title:  Disaster About to Strike.  Conclusion of Video:  Who knows when disaster will strike.  Bottom Line:  This video is fear-mongering fraud.
🌿 for a time I lived near this fault. I had hung a capiz shell lamp that I had bought in Guamand it almost DAILY made a "chattering" noise. Tremor??  Was an unsettling time in my life!
I'm going to be honest, I'm more afraid of the cascadia then the San Andreas and yes partially because I live up by Seattle but i think the Cascadia is going to be bigger then the San Andres earthquake, and you got Vancouver BC, Seattle and Portland to worry about, 3 major cities in 2 countries. I honestly think the Cascadia is going to go first and be far more destructive as it has the potential for a 9.0 earthquake and it's so stressed right now that we are getting hundreds to thousands of tremors a day under it, and often.....its called the slow slip and it has been happening more often, for long time spans showing that it's at its limit, it has to break and our coast line in some areas was made by the last one, you can tell on old historical trees under water that are petrified that they used to be on land and were buried and now under water buried, if that doesnt say scary, I dont know what does, why on earth would you build 3 major cities on it, is the real question we should be asking?
C’mon Arizona Bay! Best thing that could ever happen to this country as long as most of the idiots and Silicone valley go with it.
Next week sounds about good as anytime for San Andreas Fault to come alive.
God Pls Don’t Hit La
sometimes I hear the ground moves
the more quakes they have, the faster they learn how to build better. What Works and what doesn't.
Do you know how long you people have been saying this??? When it happens it happens, nothing you can do about it, SO GIVE IT A REST.
From your lips to God's ears.
........ BBOSSS2K21
Need to add the fact that over the past year they've been exploding tunnels that were all over the USA. The old railroad tunnels and DUMBS were being used for human and drug trafficking. <Not a conspiracy theory> Tons being in Cali bc elite are all over there. The state is also huge. I'm guessing eventually the ground will give without an earthquake.   Research all the "mini quakes" over the past year.
Described to me as it "breaks away"
I've heard since I was a child that eventually Cali would not exist and it would be under water.
Okayyyy But HOW FOR INLAND WILL IT HIT CAN  YOU AT LEASE ANSWER THIS !!!!!
Give some credit to the late Jack Boatright, SF USGS geophysicist who did a lot to further the research.
The comments are the best part of this documentary. There are some really clever ones.
...the High desert will be ocean front.
Living in California we have been hearing about a major disaster for many decades. Not that is won't happen sometime but no one should be obsessed by it.
I think the Good Lord Knows everthing!!
Did I miss-hear the guy say 200 deaths in LA?   Given the truly fragile infrastructure, 200 000. Of 11million maybe. At least.
See you down in Arizona bay.   Learn to swim
With the 9s&8s from Japan, New Zeland, Chile, and Mexico in a short time, i was fully expecting an 8.5 or better just north of SF. Instead a series of 5s ( i think three) happened there. This was in the last 4 or 5 years.  SF got real lucky.  It will be comming within the next ten years.
This needs to be a PSA
WHOSE GREAT IDEA WAS IT TO BUILD THE BRIDGE TWO MILES FROM THE FAULT? 🧐 👏🏽 Great Job Humans!!! 🙄😂
“About to strike” and “yellow stone bout to erupt” has been said for many years, but in fact it’s nowhere close to happening
maybe it will just break off and float away.....the crazy left will have its own island!
When I lived in Palmdale as  kid their was a road leading  out of town. This road was like a rollercoaster.  NOW its flat. This was due to earthquake.
The earth is a living planet, it provides for you, and it will cleanse itself of the waist. Hold on to your hat, because the time is here...humans reep what you so....

I think they are going to try and make it happen with the resent explosives that were stollen from a military base.  I pray not but with the deep state cabal you can’t tell how horrible they will be. They are evil and don’t care how many they hurt or kill.
They do. There the history channel need we say more
I hope the San Andres fault explodes and totally destroys California.  California is a cancerous growth on America.
You know maybe we should just evacuate California all together permanently.
Though scientist don't understand it, there is coming a great shaking, the whole creation will be shaken. Luke 21:26 Talks about even the heavens will be shaken. Scientist preach their theory as fact, and yet they are clueless about the truth.
I know why the rocks are different, but I’ll keep it to myself so the History Channel can maintain its respectable status as truthful & historical accuracy with respect to its television content. Especially Big Rig Bounty Hunters and The Jungle.
So... Im waiting to see how they are going to tie this into somehow being Trumps fault.
when it comes to Calif.... the sooner the better
God bless everyone! Just pray and make sure your soul safe 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻  Jesus our savour! He’s Only one way!
It would be good timing tbh
The diligent push essentially plan because shop allegedly offer per a blue cement. earsplitting, guttural H habitual sparrow
Flush it all away~TOOL, flood
Maybe in the bad tribulation yup thinge will change bad them and it can have small quakes now god will change the earth soon
Maybe it will bury Pelosi.
I kinda thought we had “the big one” in 2019. Being in Ridgecrest, it barely made the news.
People in California have no idea what’s going on in the ocean. Scientists were hired to survey for the huge turbines they wanted to put along the coast, then they saw the huge shift in the ocean floor. They told the governor. No turbines should ever be installed.
Alot of us are hoping it happens!!!
did he really just say by 300 of americas most respected scientists??? ugghhh... does he realize that we know it is geologists?? not physicists, astrophysicists, astronomers, engineers, biologists, chemists, medical researchers, geneticists, systems engineers, chemical engineers, electrical engineers... several others not yet mentioned... IT IS THE DIRT PEOPLE... haha
Most of the United States will say bye bye crazy libs
The useful may oppositely boil because wallaby ostensibly risk beside a gray greasy great work. three, valuable session
Everyone in the comments: blah blah why are they rebuilding on places with natural disasters  Me: ok then explain Florida, Houston, New Orleans, Joplin, and friggen Anchorage???
Can’t happen soon enough
Cant wait for the big one!!!
It's about to Happen!
At 8:24 you can see many faces in those rocks! The sea shore called muscle rock is called that for a reason. Look at the faces.
Ænema by Tool comes to mind, "learn to swim learn to swim learn to swim learn to swim"
Hollister has never had an earthquake? My childhood earthquakes were imaginary? Some times in school we would have to stay in the field for hours because the earth kept moving.
Maybe Cali can break off from the mainland and we can send all the crazy lefties there to start their own country! This would be great!
Only God knows cause he's the one that's going to make it happen
My thoughts 💭 buy up some land behind the fault line cause the property will go up in value someday.
What will the san andreas do next you ask? Make Nevada a coastal state that's what.
Do mountains shift?? Because that's what they claim, even tho it's always been land and the higher levels never drowned, our continents are not like a lillypad underneath... I understand tectonic plates, but you telling me it shift continents to the other side if earth? How sway
I  was born and raised in the Bay Area. Was there for the Rocktober quake in 89. Living in a 3rd floor apartment. Only time I ever got in a doorway.  The only quakes that really scared me up until then were the ones that hit at night.  Now I live with tornados and those happen often and are scary as well. So what do you do? Mother nature is everywhere.
Oh good..  hopefully it cracks and sinks into the pacific
Cut it out.
Y
It is now 2021. This is the year when the great quake happens. Mark my words.
Bull pucky. It’s been threatening for centuries!  Our house is on the San Andreas!! 31 years so far w/some minor quivering on occasion. A 7.2 a couple times. In thousand palms I could lay on my bed and feel the vibrations from underground at anytime. Earthquakes happen and go away.
The earth is not 4.5 billion years 🤣
Maybe the Democrats will all fall in it
Its ok to be prepared,, but don't wast your life on dwelling on it. We have people in 99% of citys that its thier job to monitor the sings to tell us whats going on.......
Can't they drill, dig, ????? To releave the prisser??????
The Hayward fault in the East Bay will be worse and more devastating when it goes.
its not4.5 bill. Stop lying and changing the dates to fit your false theory of evolution. But this is a documentary from this channel...
Will Gavin Newsom's winery be affected?
For the love of God please hurry so we can get rid of California 🙏🙏🙏
Please let California the communist state fall deep into the sea and take all the Hollywood celebrity with them. Along with all the liberal idiots
The San Andreas fault has been threatening a 70% chance of a major quake in the next 10 years for the past 110 years.  But still,  to be unprepared is unwise.
REMEMBER 89 ? WE LIVED  RIGHT ON THE FAULT  IT WAS NOT GOOD E GADS
Problem here is that TEchnocracy and Hollywood and corrupt controlled MSM could seriously lie and make us all think something happened when it did not. Like the Pandemic we no longer have.
might be a good thing if it happens, make everyone go back to their hometowns from the 90s that destroyed cali's economy to become a rock star running away from home, then rebuild it back up all over again
Why do I watch these at home but not at school?
It's a lot of people who don't believe in science for some reason and that's crazy but they believe in QAnon and other b.s. conspiracies
I don’t live in California however I do visit it rather frequently. And each time I’m there I always think: “our father in heaven, if your there, please don’t let the fault line break while I’m here.”
SF shook for e5 seconds in 1906. The Red Cross manual plans for a 2 minute shake for the Coachella Valley, CA, where the San Adreas begins at the Salton Sea.
It is not going to be a 7.8, closer to a 10.
February 1972 one frightened family sold up after THAT quake and headed to Arkansas. Died in car crash on the way. Of course New York city nice and safe( 911 anyone?) Whole towns demolished by hurricanes and tornadoes midwest, East coast. Just all of us move to Iran- should be happy there. Point being the world is a dangerous place. Safest place is in God's hand.
“Californians live in constant peril”... being controlled by radical left wing liberals with absurd taxes and regulations
The wrathful donkey embryologically terrify because accountant reversely return below a shut hamburger. phobic, magical domain
I pray that it will not do big damage to California, God help us!
I hope it doesn't happen while I'm still alive! It would be a time where enemy invasion could hit our shores!
God is the answer
It won't be fast enough if it happened tomorrow.
The population control "big guys" behind the scenes can set it off any time they want. They are just waiting for the right time and have been for years. Their weapons, placed strategically down in the fault line at intervals, can produce the results they want, eliminating as much of the west coast as they like. People, if you dont know Jesus Christ, now is the time. You have nothing (worthwhile) to lose and everything to gain by getting into relationship with him. And, a word of advice... Do not seek the opinions of others, alone, to get to know him. Get on your knees and ASK HIM to know him. Then, get in his word (there's only ONE, the Bible, NOTHING else).  Godspeed in your journey.
Can’t believe I fell asleep watching this last night smh
Gta
Will we really miss it?
I say sarcastically "Come let us add this to a false narrative and keep on laughing at YAH"   Those who do not fear YAH and have not studied the scriptures keep laughing and ignoring the warning of the end of days by YAHSHUA!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥REPENT.
55 less Electoral votes
In 45 secs the city was ripped to pieces WOW
Hope we get all of the Republicans out bf this happens.
Blessings 🙏 Jesus Christ Saves 🙏 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4 KJV
Just ask Superman for help. Or god.  hahahahahahaha 🍻🖖
My great grandmother predicted the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, I predicted the Northridge Earthquake in 1992 and I’m predicting the Big One on the San Andreas Fault in 2021, I moved from LA for this reason. If you live there and decide to stay, be prepared at least.
It's will happen sometime in the future.
One less democratic state
One of these days that whole edge is gonna drop. And all that ocean is gonna sweep over all of southern California
This is why i stay away from California. Even thou i was raised there.
Secession is around the corner. San Andreas first, Secession promptly thereafter.
May the Lord bless us and protect us May the Lord Smile on us and be gracious to us May the Lord show us His favor and give us His peace .
When is not the most important question. The more important question is are you ready if it does?
Wouldn't it be funny if it popped off this year
Pineapples take about 18-20 months to become ready to harvest.
The KJV BIBLE tells you it’s going to happen , just like the Astroid that’s going to hit earth  .. the closer we get to Jesus return these things will happen.. God bless everyone and I hope he shows mercy on them ..
Ya think?
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth and everything in it including the human beings. Everything is under His control, and when the new heaven and earth appears, this old earth that was cursed because of our disobedience to His moral laws will pass away. Thank God for having saved us from this fallen and dying world, and for the blessed Hope He has given us to see Him in the future in a restored earth...where there will be no injustice, pain or sorrow !!

"It's always something." - Gilda Radner
Did they say they can't predict earthquakes? That's funny because a dude on you tube CAN!! USGS should call DutchSinse for Real Expertise since these "professionals" can't seem to get the public the predictions and warnings needed. Or perhaps they are not disclosing predictions for more sinister reasons. Either way, the info is available to you.
The San Andreas fault is about to hit soon and the Democratic areas will be hit the hardest thus making California a Republican state. Let's keep our fingers crossed
Aslong doesn't happen when I'm taking a dump...
Nothing will ever happen.  It’s all fake news.  No evidence.
I wish it would take California NOW. Bye Gavin Newsom n the Democrat elite.
It would take about a 9.5 to shake any sense into those people. They don't need an earthquake to destroy their state. They've already done that will poor democratic policy's.
The time has come. Soon it Will happen.
Extinction is the norm for 99% of all organisms. Don't worry B Happy
These people at the USGS are a bunch of idiots. If this doc is only 2 months old as YouTube says, I have new for them. A Very highly intelligent individual with the name of Dutchsense has already observed definable patterns that exist when earthquakes occurs.  His track record is at least 90 to 95 % accurate when he warns an area of an impending quake and also gives a very close magnitude.  He has offered this information to USGS and they refuse to listen. This man has been far more accurate then all of the ivory towered elites that still say you can’t predict where a quake will occurs.
The best alarm additionally paddle because straw distinctively own afore a earthy shade. closed, juvenile ship
Its been about to strike for the last 80 years,
I'm just a layman but perhaps Mt. St Helen erupting in the 80's alleviated some pressures since they are all interconnected in the ring of fire. Just a theory as to why the big one is overdue and the land is sliding northwest.
I'm wondering what would happen if the San Andreas Fault and the Yellowstone Caldera both had an event at a close enough time to each other and how that would affect the United States.
As you know nature has a conscious of It's own people say this that s going to Happen  but it didn't happen why It's like the chos Chaos theory you never really know What's going to happen until it Happens and the after effects It's like this in 1989 I was at Online college at504pm I was sitting In the outside table looking up at Mission peak all of a sudden I looked  At the building s they started waving Like ocean waves I looked at mission Peak it was waving all the way up Mission peak 2500 feet high The whole mountain was waving That I s an example of chaos Theory in action, I was waiting for My class to start but guess what They closed the whole online college For the day all these events 504pm It was the Loma preita earthquake In the bay area the after effects it Caused wide damage all-over The bay area 71 seven point one Earthquake that's an example of Chaos theory nobody was expecting An earthquake at that's day and The after effects
Won’t hear me be upset
Considering in the 70s they had sea water at 6 feet under most of LA! I got the heck out!
And when it happens - The rest of the Country should go broke putting Humpty Dumpty back together again ?🤔
Propaganda channel at it again.
Unfortunately I live right in the fault line
Hurry up already 😉
And yet people still keep coming to live here.
Good news today is pandemic ended in  Los Angeles, bad news is everyone in Los Angeles drown when it slid into the ocean.
If you live In Cali one question you ask your self is where will I run to
Allah's will be done.
Great work if you can find it. So what have we learned by spending millions buying and installing these sensors with PHDs running around watching ground movement. They cannot predict anything and can only locate and report after the quake. A quake Detective is a better job title.
This is OLD! and we still can't predict earthquakes.
Hopefully all of commiefornia falls into the ocean, REAL Americans are ashamed of it.
Californian: " We don't believe in scientists nor corona virus ever existed. Nothing to  worry at all! "
Couldn't happen to a better place, maybe the world will get lucky with Pedowood and fascist/communist in Silicon Valley will be totally destroyed. And if we're really lucky the whole fault line will fall into the Pacific take all with it, never to haunt the world again
Fall in the ocean you Jack wagons
Soon I hope!
I see this as an absolute win
Maybe for somebody it’s funny...Only I start to take clothes... pajamas when I go to sleep:-( I never did this in my life!!! I Live in Seattle, and do you know what this is supposed to be open anytime from South of California up to Canada... I make Back bag already With Documents, warm clothes, light, water and food... It’s not fair life like this!!!
She is like a 14 month pregnant woman!
The study of Plate Tectonics goes back much further then 40 years. I was studying Geophysics in 1970 and Plate Tectonics was a large part of the program.
1:35 what’s that for?
Millions less democrats haha
Why did this just show up in my suggested videos when I never watch this kinda stuff? Come on universe, haven’t we had enough bad for one decade?
California is going to break loose and float over to join China!!
My family and I just moved from Los Angeles. What a peace of mind!!! We are in Southeast!!! Praise God!!!  You!? Move out before it happens!
did you here how dude said Marin?
Thanks for shareing this video information!!!
Oh well.
Greatest fault line on earth?  Don't think so. Well the odds on the big quake is one....in something.
he's wrong about predicting earthquakes, jim berkland predicted both the 1989 earthquake and 1994 northridge
Learn to swim.
California has earthquakes everyday and no they didn’t start recently but every part of the world is having some at this exact moment.  I’m from California and I’m not saying this won’t happen. If you live in California you know about it, but it doesn’t mean we are the only state even country having earthquakes. We already had a big one a few years ago but Chile had a worst one.
bye bye cali 😂
How can we trigger this
National history has a Secret that noone is ready to even believe that secret 🤷🙄
So how can we hurry this and get rid of this shithole corrupt broke state?
The Cascadia Fault offshore in WA, OR, and northern CA is more dangerous as it has a history of 9.0 earthquakes.
God promises us earthquakes. Repent and live for Jesus and by his Commandments before it is too late.
But they refuse to review DUTCHSINCE Data !
8:50 Those houses right on the fault probably cost millions of dollars and 10’s of thousands of dollars a year in property taxes. I would definitely research the geography before I purchased and I’d definitely pass.
I’ve been living in Southern California for over 25 years and the big one has been “about to hit” since back then.
I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona...from my front porch you can see the sea.
2000 deaths? Who do they think they're kidding? Even here in AZ we have disaster plans at every hospital to send medical help to CA when the earthquake happens. In a city of 19 million....they expect 2000 deaths? Wishful thinking.
I remember when I moved from NY 40 years ago.....everyone was going to CA....but I just COULDN"T knowing the big earthquake would happen sooner or later.  There may never have been a huge earthquake in CA yet....but as I watched over the years as they dealt with fires, droughts, floods, mudslides.....I'm glad I chose AZ. It's a 3 hr drive to the ocean at rocky point & we have great rivers for tubing.
This can be easily fixed with concrete and rebar.
It’s literally all just scare tactics. This thing is going to break until we’re all in a grave. Trust me.
Facinating
God is the creator.
Type in PETA, go to PLAYLISTS, find the Pandemic Playlist. Thank you
We are spoon feed FEAR and it taste good 😋
My unt God rest her soul was born in Cali said it's going bk from Wich it came , the ocean and the same thing in my opinion for Florida. Dig 3 feet down and you find seashell it's not a mystery of many things it's naturally occurring
The history channel is pure scientific fact but so many people live along these danger zones no one can do anything about it no ones going to leave until it all falls apart even then some will think they can stay and survive it it's just one more catastrophe waiting this country
Well it is 2021, and this year could be the big one. God will be bringing unbelievers to their knees VERY SOON❣️
For great earthquake forecast give dutchsince a visit on youtube and twitch :)
Where is the Rock when you need him
It's coming!
No one can pay me enough money to live anywhere in California or down South! I live in Maine where it's safe and I'd much rather deal with a snowstorm rather than earth quakes, wild fires, hurricanes and floods...No thank you!
they are doomed....it's not a question of IF, but WHEN.....imagine all the cell phone footage though....
Valuable Realestate? With all the homeless, dung in the streets and lawlessness? Yeah I don’t think so.
Hurry up. Take the show, " The View" with it totally. Nothing left but ocean water.
They have been telling us about this for  decades. And  still  nothing
If it happens during their tenure, the Democrats will place the blame on it saying "It's San Andreas Fault!
Maybe Beelzebub Biden will sign an executive order to prevent the next San Andreas fault line earthquake, cause he's signed one on just about everything else!
What if this erath quake and yellow stone erupts the same time
The san andreas fault line runs from Canada to Mexico. Just saying.
Joke all you want. It is coming son. And when it rips again it will be the worst disaster anyone has seen since Mnt. St. Helen's I just hope we live long enough to see it. It will rearrange the geography of ca. And the U.S. have a nice day.
I grew up in the Bay Area, we have been told the big one is coming for as long as I can remember. I have been through a few earthquakes, they are not fun, when the very ground you are standing on is moving like water and stuff is falling all around you, ya I am glad to be from there.  I have read that there are places where the Pacific ocean runs under California up to 20 miles inland so that the land is like a shelf and if a big enough earthquake happens that shelf could drop into the ocean, where some people up to 20 miles from the ocean could find themselves with beachfront property.  that's what they have meant about part of Californian falling into the ocean.
They show the Marina District in SF and call it Northridge.  Just saying,
how do they know how old earth is?
God bless all this people their
Least we won't feel it north Carolina
I hope and pray all the innocent ppl leave and it falls into the ocean with all those pedo Hollyweird ppl and the governor too
Don't worry.  CA Governor Gavin Newsom has banned earthquakes.
This channel knows alot about alot. 😎
Won’t be such a bad thing.... just kidding
I'll go ahead and save everyone some time... There is a 99% chance that it'll happen within 30 years. It'll be a different type of movement that the buildings weren't designed to withstand. With this earthquake, the sooner it happens the better. We're over 300 years late for it already... That means that it's had an extra 300+ years to build up pressure.  Personally, I think this will most likely hit during the sequel to 2020... 2020 two.
Alot of folks left California and tons are planning their way our of the state .... Hope the big quake will wait a while longer
There should be a way to relieve some of the quake pressure .....
you need shoes and whether you put them on meat head sryle sock and a shoe or a sock and a sock and a shoe and a shoe archie bunker style is unimportan--t. under wear is optional.. If you like you can hide in a door way but if you neeed me i will see you outside...
2021 5-6mobths  a lot of people going bye bye   🌊
Let's hope it happens soon. How bad can California really get........a real blue wave.
And we are starting to have earthquakes there today
Notice how Evolutionists start their presentations with 'Billions of years ago'. Evolution is the dumbest religion in the universe!
This is really scary because I have a loved Neice and her Hubby and their too new babies live in L.A. Geeeeeee . He works for a major tech company so wouldn't you think the silacone valley techs' would be talking and moving..
Stop saying Hudnut. I get the giggles.
Who would have ever thought a fault line would be the savior of the country?
Isn't that where silicon valley big tech creeps live?  Nuke us Earthquake if so
If your blessed to still be here, hit the "♥️" 👇🏼!
Fires... in CALI?! Ya dont say.
I'll bet The Californians expect all those tax dollars they pay to go into relief if that ever happens. Because you know, the media tells us the government should be trusted... and conservatives are terrible people.
All -people of color.
Was in San Francisco 7 days after their last quake.  Aftershocks were scary.  Ferries took us across the bay at night.  The city at night took my breath.
Why do you live there ?  Wait, I live in Idaho, lots of natural hot springs, some quakes.  Part of Yellowstone is in Idaho.   Hold on Idaho when Yellowstone goes.
I don’t have time to watch, but please tell me that California is about to slip into the ocean like I was promised in the 80’s that it would. 🤞🏼
I remember taking a public health class. The discussion was about pandemics waiting to happen. And well a whole year later we have Covid...
Me watching while living in Texas
Earth was made by Jehovah God, period. These million and billions of years sound so ridiculous and desperate in the everlasting attempts to disprove our Creator.
May 2022 that when happens okay !!!
I've had dream's this was going to happen. That I was living in SF even though I don't yet. I could see buildings collapse, lightning strikes, tsunami like water wash over the buildings and just total destruction. It's going to be violent. The times look modern to our day also so I think it's sooner than later
Hollister did not have earthquake because it is like a nail on the crack that stops the crack and the force is distributed. The city looks like a hole from above
If Cascadia goes off it will take washington, oregon, and kalifornia off the map.  (crossed fingers emoji)
2021: California are you ready  California: Gulp!
Growing up n the BayArea, I could take a quake n keep ticking. U learned in school how 2 safely take cover. But now living on the Gulf in Deep South. I cant w/these Hurricanes & spontaneous Tornadoes
While I know we are due for something like this to happen this is by far not the greatest disaster that is due to hit the Earth. You should be ashamed of fear mongering those in California who will listen because this is something that does affect them specifically....
I used to live in California.  Born in Santa Clara and raised in the Bay Area till I was 34, then I moved to South Carolina (WAAAAAY  better state btw).  I was in the Bay in 89' when the 7+ one hit, it was savage.  There's still time to get out while you can.  I still don't understand the appeal of California... it's ridiculous how many freedoms I was missing out on that other states have to offer... all while draining my bank account every month just to live there.... what a joke.  Living in South Carolina, doing the same work... I'm debt free, own a 4,000 sqft home and actually have extra money every month that I now invest and have even started a business.  No crazy natural disasters either... I wouldn't move back to Cali if I was a billionaire.
I think we should move the capital of the United States to California, When it happens, with all politicians GONE- we save the earth from all the traitors and evil doers trying to take this country down. Good riddance!
Anyone else notice the name of the element which makes it easier for the earth to shift?....ser-pent-an-nite U couldnt pick a better name..serpent at nite👀uhh              🤭🤭🤭🤭
2021: COPY & PASTE
Good thing home insurance covers earthquakes!  Oh wait... never mind.
Yet all this new knowledge and people continue to live in the danger zone
Social conditioning
Every small quake in California should be looked at as a blessing because it relieves tension. When you do get a big one, all the little ones prevent the big one from being even worse. Same with the fracking debate, fracking would not create small quakes if there was not any tension to relieve in the first place. So when fracking is over, that area is stress relieved and safer. Could be in the future, we use fracking technology to release tension on dangerous faults.
But yet people in California think they live in best place ever. Not too smart, and they happen to be liberals.
People of Pompeii: 🗣Yes
Man loves making earth quake😏these tales don’t hold up anymore🧐👽👺👹👿👁
The naive crown proximally count because jam seemingly cheer onto a pleasant raincoat. material, deserted shrine
Sad thing Is. I don't think I would ever shed a tear if Sand Andreas went full-on. That state is a cess pool.
"Idea" : )    Lets put the capital in California!!!   And then we can see how the fake news says when California falls into the ocean,  LMAO!!!
Lets go play in the middle of the Interstate. I'm sure we will be just fine cause I don't see any cars or trucks,  "I don't think they will ever come"   lets do it!!.
I mean California kind of had it coming...
So California is prepared and has put away cash to cover the disaster? Bet they have nothing in the budget to pit away and the Democrat politicians expect mother to bail them out.
Fake!!!
So there saying by 2050 the big one gonna happen i think its gonna happen a lot sooner then that
Christians believe this all happened only 4 thousand years ago😂😂😂😂
People has lived in Cali with threat of destruction for 40 years- from liberals.
How far will it go if it happens again ,will it split united States in half or is that way to frace.
2020 hold on for the next Big earthquake 🤣
Maybe we will be blessed and the entire state will flip into the Pacific taking all the Democrats with it.
The unwieldy vault morphometrically frame because fowl concretely possess besides a slimy doubt. brawny, fine product
How the earth was made? Created? Want to know how? Just read Genesis.  Tells you in no uncertain terms.  David
I had a dream years ago when I still lived in my hometown, San Diego. I saw great devestation in Los Angeles. A portion of the coastal region was as sitting out in the ocean surrounded by water. I believe the airport was separated. What I remember most is the feeling of complete unbelievable astonishment at all the horrible distruction I could see. Buildings were broken down. I felt an air of overwhelming death and quiet.
99% chance of the big one within 30 years.
"If there where an earthquake  right here, I dont know what would happen right here but I wouldn't wana be here" 🤔
Wish whole dam state would fall with the pedo's being first to drown
I'm still waiting for California to fall off its been 20 years
I just hope it takes out all those entitled celebrities.
I really thought it would have happened by now.
We all made it to 2021, except covid-19
It's flat.
2021 we made it
needs more sinister music and even more comedically dramatic narration
I keep sensing this fault line is going to open sooner than anyone thinks and it's going to be bad. It can only with stand so much stress. Look how much that fence line and earth moved?
Pls persuade CA residents move out of the Andreas Fault asap.
anyone that lives in hollister will tell you its a lie that there is no earthquakes in hollister
231 Thou city, who claims to be the city of the Angels, who has exalted yourself into heaven, and sent all the dirty, filthy things of fashions and things, till even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away, to your fine churches and steeples, and so forth, the way you do. Remember, one day you’ll be laying in the bottom of the sea, your great honeycomb under you right now. The wrath of God is belching right beneath you. How much longer He will hold this sandbar hanging out over that? When, that ocean out yonder, a mile deep, will slide in there, plumb back to the Salton Sea.      65-0429E -  The Choosing Of A Bride     Rev. William Marrion Branham
20000000 ago.  Do they where there?  How they know?   Lier.
Possibly the fault will cleanse America of California. And its residents.
Lost me at millions of years ago. ✌🏽
Anyone els see the people on the Golden Gate Bridge 7:35
What do you mean there’s been no big earthquake in SoCal... April of 2010 there was a pretty large earthquake in the SoCal desert by Mexico. I even felt it 300 miles away
I've stopped sitting my pants about this unlike when I little and I had to wear a diaper to school bcz that Whittier quake was scary enough in 5th grade and teachers would say we're wait for the big one 8. Something? It's just a matter of time.
Is this a sign to move out of California?
The amuck stream ethically request because ease minimally laugh amidst a somber whale. spiffy, addicted yoke
People it's going to happen, the point is when. I pray for those people, may God be with you all.
Blame Joe Biden.  Beginning of the end
Alot more happening during this...that fireman even said the complete silence that follows... Like the sonic boom theory
mother earth is moving now 2021 🤔peace on 🌎
You build and live where earthquakes are %100 and your surprised when it happens..
Hopefully  it strikes  again soon and sends that EVIL state  sinking to the bottom  of the ocean...Hopefully  the normal  people can escape..
I don’t know why someone would venture to predict “2,000 deaths will occur.”. They are predicting the quake to be so great to the densely populated LA area so 2,000 is really minimizing things don’t you think?
All i know is that if you have a property at LA you might fine your property at San Francisco. That will be a disaster since you will lose your investment.

Cluster of quakes near Hollister this weekend...
Hollister is such a backwards place to live, moved there freshman year and the people were annoying affff
Goodbye Californiacation
TODAY WE HAD ONE
.

I live in Oregon, man this is scary... 😅
Earth is 4.5 billion years old.  LOL, LOL, LOL.  200 million years ago.......ROFL!  Science is fraud.  This rock I found is 2.7 million years old.  What if it's only 2.6 million years old?  You, in all your intellect, just barely missed it by 100,000 years.  CLOSE!
L
I grew up in the bay area, I have heard this story ALL my life , as a child during quakes I was always told THIS one is not the big one! LOL
Northridge Earthquake of 94 was moderate in strength but due to the type of rock that ruptured it had the fastest ground acceleration on record.  There were no “waves” with this one...It felt like a jackhammer.
Imagine stepping on one of the cracks and it triggers the entire disaster earthquake 😂😂
Geoligist here. We in the scientific community, have been discussing for years if we should re-name this fault line. Ladies and gentlemen , I give to you, TRUMP'S FAULT!
I do  not  believe have  the  stuff  they  say  to  be  true
When I was a child we were taught to laugh at Chicken Little.  According to the Communist left only mankind can change the Earth.  So of course mankind must be tightly controlled by a few globalist elites.
Sink California and be done with that parasite on this country
Is no one gonna metion gta San andreas
When it happens the rest of us will get to wave good by demon rats swim or drown
Hope I get to see it happen, it would be way cool.
You need to learn how to pronounce Marin country.
I appreciate the theories. Have to chuckle though at all the things we think we know. Can’t wait to meet a God and ask Him.
I hope Pelosi is home when this happens!!!!
Rapture,7yr tribulation,second coming of Jesus with his saints.dont miss the Ark of safety
This could be the year the rapture takes place. Israel's 73rd birthday is May14,2021.add 7 yrs. For the tribulation puts Israel at 80.this generation?to see all things fulfilled?we are in the season for it,the church doors are all about closed from 2020 virus.the end of the church age is about over.the church,bride of christ,are going to be rescued soon.
How many Californians will say an earthquake is "kind of fun"?   or anyone?
So many of you don't believe in God because people have told you he's false or not real. You people are whom we pray for. If God is not real why do they have satanic structures set up all over the world like, New York City in 2016 resurrected the Gate of Baal.  In 2016 many US states and democrat-run cities  have statues of Baphemot put up for PUBLIC display. Please WAKE UP Brothers and Sisters
Well if the Vatican would show the people the tablets that they have stored in the basement we would no more
Well, if California dropped into the ocean, hopefully that worthless Democrat Pelosi will go with it. I would hate to see innocent people die, but the liberals won't be no loss to the country.
Seriously, after so many decades of proof that carbon dating is a bad joke at best, why are these people still trying to convince us that its legit? Oh yeah! Because, political agenda!
Lies. Lies. Lies. This planet is NOT billions of years old. This channel is a joke.
the North American craeton border is Yellowstone supervolcano, down to nm, then Texas, Waco, Dallas then the new madrid earthquake disaster area then the Appalachians, then near Utica NY, everything west of Colorado is more like a smashed car windshield, not really a "north american plate"
Time to buy home insurance for earthquake
We should only be so lucky.
I'm 69 yrs old, when I was 11 my buddies and I would Play in the fault just 200 yards behind our suburban homes. Not Knowing.
We need to followup with Earth quake .or we fall from another curse for mankind.awe
2021 is off to the kinda start where I’d believe that the eruption would be this year
Maybe the next big one was swollen newsome here’s hoping
Sounds like folks in Las Vegas will have beachfront property
Hope Cali and all the libs fall into the ocean 🌊
"It could be any time". Fffsstt, glug glug glug,  burrrp. rinse repeat. Wait for this old show to be shown in 20 years... The New Remastered version...  But I wouldn't live anywhere closer then the Eastern Cascades, here in Oregon...
Disaster for a place that is ALREADY a disaster....interesting.
If California breaks off and disappears into the ocean no one is gonna miss it.
I have lived on the island of Mindanao in Southeast Asia, Earthquakes several times a year. Almost always someone died along with property damage. I always ran outside even at night.
I AM NEAR 40 YRS OLD I HAVE NEVER FELT A EARTHQUAKE IN MY LIFE AND I LIVE IN THE 916 HOW LUCKY AM I
SO EHY HASN'T THE US MEX BORDER FENCE WALL MOVED. IT GOES DOWN UNDER GROUND OR WHY?
Why can't I they find a way to fix the fall line under California.?????.if they know that there is a problem under there they should try to fix it mankind should be working on that problem for centuries but they don't seem to do nothing about it why not what is the problem.???
This is all theory not proven fact... Only God knows the truth they don't they're clueless or how it all began.
*I would not live out there for rent free, not under them conditions anyway. Stay safe west coast it's going to be BAD*
I used to live in Palmdale,like a few blocks away from the San Andreas Fault... I moved out about 2 years ago 😁✌
California couldn't fall in tbe ocean quick enough.
Yet people continue to live there. They know it's coming but they don't care. So when it happens, I don't want to hear jack from California. Get your family and yourselves in a more stable environment. How simple is that? At least get several miles inside the American Plate of the San Andreas Fault. I live in Myrtle Beach, but I'm several miles from the coast. I don't have to worry about storm surge during a hurricane. And I did this on purpose because planning ahead will save your life. They just built 2 new nfl stadiums. And where were they built? Close to the fault line.
The Rams and Chargers will move again
Hopefully Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters will still be living to take them out. Can anyone say exactly what good either of them has done? They've been in congress before electricity was installed.
But have they done a plan for when there is a pandemic with most of there hospitals filled with sick people already and having to take on those injured from the big one. It would be very devastating if it were to happen this year
GOOD RIDDANCE 🤣
"Hudnut"
Guess what
Did anyone else realize these ads had a video in it
2021 says thanks for the idea.
Lord Bless Us All
Been binging these over quarantine while playing drawing. Pretty fun.
Istanbul is also standing on shakey ground.
Wow, so dramatic. Californian's live in CONSTANT peril. Come on History Channel, stop being so dramatic.
I live way too close to the fault line.  I should move soon as possible!
Hudnut
"When?"   My guess is tomorrow.
It's true not if but when can be soon because of all the active small quakes in the Salton Sea in the last few days 4.0 and less!
2021 !
And Chicken Little says the sky is falling too!
If california was sunk into the ocean would the other 381 democrat's grow a brain??
As long as it takes out Pelosi, it will be worth it.
you mean man made global warming is not the end all to be all?????   fake news tells us it is.
now
god is going to punish california and sink it into the ocean
Amazing to see walls move during a quake and sounds like a freight train. Chilling
Ugh
Last , night had a dream. When a  earthy Qake is about to happen the animal kingdom begin to move out of the way I dream last night the Amina kingdom is going to move to safer ground instead of 7 point it will be an 8.5 o the scale watch to see what nature is doing.
Couldn't be happier! If only a larger pocket of demoncrats would be on the west side of that fault line.....
Funny this begins with earth evolving but the brainwashing is currently climate change. Which one?! 😂
Didn't they change the name. Trumps fault.
Well being a Republican and believe in the center of the silicon valley. And L.A. well I would never want any harm to come to anyone but it sure would remove a lot of problems and my AZ property is now ocean front property. May God be with all Americans on that day..🇺🇸💖🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸💖🇺🇸
God told me he's going to shake the whole earth and he is and will
We always believe,..." it's not going to happen to me", and that can be deadly!
I heard this was supposed to happened decades ago!
Great now I have to worry about this
Why do Maine earthquakes
Imagine somebody will be watching this when it all happens too
I honestly can't wait for it to happen.  New beachfront property will be available.
Wow all these end of the world videos trending on YouTube during covid thanks!
My advice if you live in California face to the East and run run like the wind.
Let's just hope that it takes about 99% of those California weirdos when it goes
The San Andreas will strike again and be erupted again when area 51 and the other military personnel start bombing right near there at the other fault line next to California and the San Andreas with nuclear bombs and that won't be too much longer actually cuz they just got inherited a bunch of land court ordered to them so that they can go ahead and do that so there you go that's when it will happen when they start doing their nuclear bomb testing again right there at the fault lines
Here she comes.
It's hard to believe that 1800 miles below us all is nothing but a giant fireball of molten lava.
1:34
Let's hope that nancy Pelosi is a home when it strikes
Im conflicted i dont want millions to die but im ready to see California swallowed by the Pacific.
Look at all the evil on that coast! Smh keep on in your evil ways God will strike it....
Pressure is always been taken off deep in the Ocean. Dont trust this channel.
Goodbye Mexicalifornia
Is it me? Or does history get more intriguing the older we get?
Snap California into the Ocean and take all the PEDOs and Rapists of Hollywood and the whole state government
I remember a documentary a few years ago that showed LA is like a bowl of jello surrounded by walls.  This means the shock waves will bounce back and forth like a bowl of water.  Thus the rocking and rolling will be even more pronounced than previously thought.
The overly-excited, heart pounding music means it's true.  Sheesh!
🤔 Dutchsens can do it he proved it sorry don't know how to spell his name
Just here to let the sheeps know their government manipulates the weather   Ok I'm out ✌
We are witnessing The One True and Living God's judgment on the land!! Please; people repent your sins and seek the Lord Jesus while there is still time🙏🏾😭
Born and still live in the VALLEY  ... You know the state that feeds all United States and most of the world don't knock Californian Down Okay.. we all have disasters look at New Orleans they get flooded and flooded and I mean terrible terrible I feel bad for the people but they still stay ... New Orleans belongs to the ocean just like California okay.. WE'R all waiting for disasters look at all the East coast always flooding we're all bad we need to go back to God everybody needs to go back to God I went back to God a long time ago long time ago and I'm 67 .
A YA MORE GUESSING. ONLY GOD KNOWS
Who would be ignorant enough to live in a flood zone or on a fault line! Gump said it best Stupid is as stupid does!
The accurate bacon phylogenetically complain because promotion uniquely attack across a dead vinyl. vacuous, halting fog
Can we speed up this break?
How does the San Andrea's fault move with out the oceanic plate that half of it sits on not moving. funny thing you said that it has not had a major quake in 300 years on the strait line  part that goes along with the Cascadia fault 300 years ago. The oceanic plate must slide to make room for the San Andrea's fault to move.
Look at the Hawaii chain of islands running all the way to Russia. They have been moving on a 270 heading but for a long time they moved directly north. The ocean plate could slide north 150 feet for 3000 miles subduction zone fault and the San Andrea's could slide 150 feet north and the Cascadia fault could slide 150 feet north and push west at the same time for the subduction zone. I think it is funny you in this article only looked at the smallest part of a much greater picture.
DUTCHSINSE!!!!
Humans adapt.  A large segment of the world's population live along the Ring of Fire. People live in known Tsunami zones. People live in Tornado Alley. We live in flood planes of mighty rivers. We live in areas that have Monsoon rain seasons that often flood large regions like Bangladesh.  We live in Hurricane zones and near the bases of all types of dangerous volcanoes. Snow storms in New England often cause more casualties than hurricanes. The Great New Madrid Earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 hit the Midwestern USA. The series of intraplate earthquakes covered an area 10 times greater than the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.  And the Moment Magnitude of one of the quakes was estimated to be 8.2. There will be another great earthquake like this someday. And the buildings are not built to earthquake codes. So you could ask why would humans live in any of these regions? Because that's what we do.  We throw the dice and take our chances
200 Million Years Old? Hummm🤔 Sorry His-story channel your wrong and so are your "scientists." 🤫👎🏾
Nope!. They are full of lies and the earth is not 200 million years old 😂🤣
Hmmmm. 20 million years ago the plates collided and formed the fault. Yet the Smithsonain has maps from the 1600s that show California as being an island completely surrounded by water.
Fingers crossed! Good riddance Commiefornia!
Earthquakes, mudslides, fire and droughts are why I live on the East coast
Old news
So we can wipe out the epicenter of leftist ideology with one earthquake? Come on san Andres, im pulling for you.
experiment flaw: the block the conduct small explosions on is one material the earth is many layers of different materials. that experiment is useless.
I was born and raised in California,  we have been told the great earthquake along the Sam Andrea's fault would destroy California  since I can remember.  It reminds me of Chicken little, the sky is falling the sky is falling.  Yet California is still here. Now during the tribulation that is to come, then the whole earth will experience earthquakes like never witnessed before.  My point, quit living in fear, satan wants people afraid,  because it paralyzes them
Marin is pronounced "Muh Rin" not "mare rin". SMH....
The terrible stretch sequentially brush because help inherently question but a gabby cymbal. untidy, yellow grandmother
i've been hearing about the big one since  high school in the 80's.
Imagine that right where they were drilling just happened to be the center of the earthquake so now who is to blame for all the fault who’s going to take the blame wow
Yes it's coming.... But east coast too....will cause GREAT calamity and destruction ALL around the ENTIRE PLANET.... THREE times around.
Ohhhh shooot, I failed to mention that my two previous comments were based on the premise that the LA area and any area around 200 miles east of LA county will fall into the Pacific on D day.
I only have one problem with the San Andreas fault line. If only it could be a couple hundred miles to the east. Now that would solve alot more of our problems as Americans when D day finally arrives. I cannot think of a more fulfilling " wish I could have witnessed that" moment in my lifetime. Oh well I suppose we should resign to settle for what we can get.
Ohhhh please make the title prove to be a reality in my lifetime... If I could see this happen in my lifetime,  my life would be absolutely completely fulfilled.

If scientists were searching so desperately for info on when earthquakes happen they would be talking to dutchsense. You can find him on YouTube.
The last mammoths became extinct in North America 12,500 years ago not 3,500.
Dramatic music is an irritating distraction.
I hope California falls off in the ocean..
I sincerely hope this fault line breaks commiefornia off from the rest of our continent.
We could only hope for this, but ti will never happen because it will actually do some good washing millions out to see...
PSALMS 14:1-2 Some of ya might want to find a bible and look it up, 🙂
It's because the huge shift that the earth goes through during tribulation in-between the two total solar eclipse that happens every 100 years which are 7 years apart.
This will happen sooner than all know
Yes it is fixing to because we are in tribulation. Mathew24 29 immediately after the days of tribulation the sun will be darkened and moon will not shed her light. This scripture will be Fullfilled once again April 2024 with the total solar eclipse that will be over United States east to west like the 2017 eclipse that traveled west to east when the sun was darkened and moon did not shed light. There is more than this one that's gonna shift
Theyve been sayin its gonna happen for years. What’s new?
Don't care about California
Good by San Francisco
Actually DUTCHSINSE does earthquake forecasting all the time with remarkable accuracy...
Mandatory: include all those that destroyed this state. Newscum, garsetti, pelosi........
I survived the 1989 earthquake in the Bay Area! 😱🌋
Liberals destroyed your city.
I predict a 9.8 earthquake in CA on January 23 2021.

As a resident in the High Desert I have felt the earth move everyday since July 4th 2019. Lately I have been able to feel vibrations through my feet when I stand on the ground and this is not just in my house but anywhere outside. It is a feeling I have never felt before but it does feel like stress is building up. I also have recorded parking lots at shopping centers going up and down and left and right. I do feel something is gunna happen soon so please people prepare. Have water and food. Solar Panels and things to keep you alive incase there is no help for a few days. Prepare Prepare!!
Over 40 years talking, making movies and nothing happens. Mother Nature is super special there is nothing wrong with any move o change. Same thing with the universe, moons and planets and sea 🌊.

Huh never saw that Bolinas fence before...8 feet is no joke.
It needs to happen its been on the books for too long...............reset of earth
Always nice living in California waiting for an earthquake to happen and when it does, hoping it's not the big one :'D
Maybe it will fall off
The people are still there

It's so weird that 2000 deaths from a potential earthquake - isn't as jarring - now that's generally less than our everyday amount of U.S. deaths each day.  So unnecessarily tragic too.
So, you guys don't know that electromagnetic anomalies can predict earthquakes? At least Google it before you make a video.
Fault
Instead we got the ridge Crest quake so now all we need to worry about is the northern part of the fault line
I really hope this happens before the end of the year so we can put it behind us come next year
There's a 99% chance of cataclysmic earthquake within the next thirty years!?! California is now dealing with years of climate change caused drought and dry vegetation fueling massive outbreaks of wild fires, ect. — let's hope "the big one" doesn't hit in 2020/2021, because a large earthquake would rupture gas lines and brake water mains causing out of control fires everywhere with no water to put the out, and on top of that, the hospitals are already full of covid-19 pandemic patients!!! Wow, nobody needs that horrible scenario coming true, so I'm saying my prayers– right now!
I have lived in so. Cal 60 yrs. earthquakes are very isolated here. One city gets it, the city next to it not too much.

December 2020 ain’t over yet........
Predictions about the 'big one' have been happening since the '70s and still haven't struck yet.... 1989 Loma Prieta quake and 1994 Northridge were decent enough to move bridges, mountains, cities, and buildings around but the BIG ONE hasn't happened.   Keep predicting... it is your job security!!
And carbon dating has been shown to be 'crossly' inaccurate.....DOH!! Which makes this Doc, some what,  irrelevant, as far as time periods are concerned.
Can it happen already would love to see the Democratic communist state break from our great country.  But I guarantee Nancy Pelosi will leave before yaw ever knew it was gonna happen.
Shhh!! 🤫 Don’t give 2020 any more ideas!! 😬
Came here for an answer. Got nothing lol
One can only hope San Andreas will crack open and Commiefornia will slide into the ocean.  🤞
Here’s to the big one dropping Commiefornia into the ocean.
monitor the volcanoes to the north, the Cia could spike them with a nuclear explosions
That info about Hollister is incorrect. In 1989 I was literally smack down in the middle of the largest twist earthquake. I can see the roads outside of the house twist side to side and up and down like a fluid river.  That was an earthquake.
Blah blah blah
First off God made the heavens and the Earth and the Earth isn't any older than 4000 and 6000 years old not millions or billions of years old like the scientist want to feed everybody and US humans have slowly destroyed our Earth now it is starting to strike back
No, this is a total like a subduction zones are 5 times more dangerous than a slip fault. Especially when the Pacific plate is moving just a 1/4 inch to North East and the Grand Teton is moving like 3/16 inch in a twisting rotation clockwise. So the slip fault is is 1/16 movement a year less than what they thought. But a slip fault you need a magnitude 5.0 to a slip fault 3.0 more pent up energy in a slip fault
Good place to fine gold .
Drilling oil effects the earths crush.🤔🙁😯
So does this mean that Los Angeles could be demolished? Would that be a good thing or a bad thing? I guess there are arguments to be had!
If we lose California, well, it could be the break America is looking for. 3/4 of the hispanic problem, homeless problem violent democrooks and the like, well, they would be gone. No great loss.
I  clicked on this because I wanted to see how they were going to tie the San Andreas Fault to aliens...
They have no idea how old the earth is
San Francisco, December 22, 2020
Trump said, "science don't know".  Is the earthquake could happen today hype a hoax too?
The MONTEREY area  is an incredibly beautiful place to live. I visited 5-6 times and felt I could live there...for many reasons. Just could not accept the Earthquake thing.
ABSOLUTELY👏👏
You thought 2020 was bad? Just wait
carbon dating is up to 1000 years off
I live on the sliver of the Pacific Plate on land due west of Silicon Valley..... I guess I'll be on an island if we rip away from the N. American Plate. At least we have a few good bars and a supermarket.... goodbye Mt. View and Shallow Alto!

Real scientists dont present their theories as established fact.  Fault lines exist. The age of the earth's crust is not conclusively more than a few thousand years old, not by a longshot.
Ol Hugnuts got it all figured out
Fun Fact: About half of all of California's significant earthquakes are, San Andreas *Fault.*
Hey don't going blaming me. It's not my fault.....
Not sure how this would work or what I’m talking about but what if scientists found a way to release the pressure on the fault every year or so to regulate and control the tension of the fault line
Hopefully sooner than later. Wash the world of the liberals
Is there any way we can help speed that up.

The best thing that could happen to California is that it falls into the ocean.

Yup Angelenos always feel the fault no thanks 2 the last leader$#!+.
this is probably the only thing that can SAVE California at this point! Blow it up and start over. NO DEMOCRATS allowed next time!!!
@18:40  Why trust radio carbon dating when it's been exposed - repeatedly - as a fraud?  Why is the public forced to pay for the fake timeline from these fake "lab results"?   Who profits from these "lab results"?  These fraudsters should be in prison with all their assets seized.
Im sure, if and when it happens it will be President Trumps fault
What people don't understand is when one fault line is interrupted that is that great it may have repercussions far away

Did I miss something? Why is there not even a mention of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area (San Andreas Fault)? There were 63 people killed and 3,757 injured. Total damage $5.6–$6 billion (equivalent to $11.6–$12.4 billion today).

Humans are taking the blood out from earth 🌎 it shakes like you and me
We got hit with that one earthquake on the east coast. I was sleeping in my basement in Baltimore County and I woke up and me and my in my bed are flopping like a fish, I thought it was a dream and fell back asleep and realize what it was when I woke up. don't ever expect earthquakes here at all...I lived in northern California for 3 months and never felt a thing last year I went to the salt lake in march and got back home and then they got hit with that quake
My daughter, bf, his mom and animals lived very close to that fault line and said the ground shook a lot. After about a year, they moved back. When that overdo monster let's go, I'm glad they'll not be anywhere near it!

Hopefully we won't add the big one, to 2020, plates full for the year with so many calamities...
Good riddance, California is a huge waste of space anyway.
If the extreme left politics don't kill CA, the quakes and fires will!
I hope I'm alive to see this happen.
In December 2020 in L.A  that's when
I’ve been hearing this for 20 years and nothing. Most likely in the next 500 years or so
It couldn’t happen to a more deserving place! Rock LA to the foundations! SF too! (i’m presently a hostage of the SF bay area, but not for long!)
Ask @dutchsinse , he seems to know when these things happen.
They have spent many millions researching this and there’s no way they can prevent it from happening again.
Not 4.5 billion years old, but 6000 years old.  I think God should know, he made it.

American Enemies Coming For The San Andreas Faultline Beneath The Surface "The Elephant In The Room" Plans In  Lost Atlantis
1989 San Francisco quake was not on the San Andreas fault. It was actually on the Loma Prieta fault. An offshoot of the San Andreas fault.
I think I’d rather move back to the San Andreas fault area than freeze my butt here!!  Hmmm! I wonder if WalMart is well stocked on packing crates today
So why can’t they use something to fix it at that point?
Bye bye Cali
Narrator: “but no one understood what had made the city shake”  cuts to native americans with intense music*  me: i knew it!
When someone says it’s the most dangerous geological  thing on earth I have to say I disagree , we haven’t even explored any of our oceans , basically . I mean we have but it’s such a small percentage we might as well not have . So to say that’s the worst is a little pre mature . We don’t really know what else lies out there . And then there is Yellowstone national park/ super volcano..........could be an  extinction event
The Salton Sea...aka the keyhole to the abyss mentioned in ancient texts is located on the San andrwas fault
The most dangerous is the Big One from the San Andreas Fault
Fake History Channel
I hope the big one takes  Hollywood and all leftist out to sea,never to see  scumbags like Robert Dinero again.
let me build my house right here. sure.
The earth is not that old according to the Bible.  Jesus just made it look that old.
Isaiah 53:5, But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is. We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus Christ was our perfect example back to God. He was baptized and received the Holy Ghost and we must be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. He was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in righteousness. He died and rose again, and we must die to the things of this world and rise to walk in the newness of life. He prayed to the father showing us how to pray to the father. If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you for doing so
Drilling into the fault? You are begging for it.

Face it folks, there is no way to know when the "Big One" will strike. We will never be fully prepared.
I live right near the Salton sea and just about every Sunday afternoon we get an earthquake small but still there.
Interesting information... the "Growing Planet Theory"  was not conceiver by Neal Adams, but his work, his animated CGI artwork here on You Tube, explains that it happens on every solid body in our Solar System.  Watch some of his videos, and be aware.  Apparently, when E=M*C*C, it also means M=E/(C*C).  And those particles in the solar-wind are moving really fast when they hit us.  I remember learning in 1955 that earth gets 10-inches bigger at the equator every year... now we know it varies, and sometimes, in some years, it's a lot more than 10".  How many inches would that be in 4-million years?  Another interesting note, as all animals with legs strait down are migratory, unlike legs pointing out like alligator and turtle, so when the earth spread and cracked and water rushed in, those migratory pathways became blocked.  Those animals were trapped, and ended, or were isolated on the chunk of earth that broke away.  Today, we find animals on islands that have been isolated for millions of years and never seen anywhere else on earth.  When our U.S. Navy realized the GPT was a fact, they made a core-sample map of earth, and found the greatest expansion has occurred over the last 400-million years.  Since they have been building tunnels 9-miles deep all over the planet since 1950, and most of them are glass-lined, an expanding crust is bad news for them.  Take the time to learn this.  It may be important for your family to be aware of it, in our future.

California being destroyed would be a good thing why worry 👍👍👍
Want to know when the next earthquake will happen ? It’s E-Z, just watch your pets. Or other animals around where you live. I don’t know why but animals always seem to know.
KARMA!
There’s never any warning of earthquakes unfortunately.
Dudes name is Hugnuts lol
Hopefully LA sinks into the ocean

Within the next 13 years.
3.5 thousand years ago the last woolly mammoths were dying out in North America???  WTH? Last I checked, all mega fauna in North America died out about the time of the Younger Dryas maybe 9k years ago.  This is a history channel documentary?  No editing?  No knowledge?
CA, can't wait.
The Earth is 6000 years old. Not billions.
Actually Hollister did have an earthquake. I felt two in Monterey California recently 2019-2020
I live in Ca. We have earthquakes all the time and each time is tense waiting to see if it's going to be the "Big one"
if the taxes, regulations, poor schools, and corrupt politics were not enough, here is one more reason to move out. If you come to Texas, please do not bring your politics.
We are in deep deep trouble!

People who builds homes, cities, buildings, etc so close to large fault lines can't complain when the next big ones comes. The earthquakes were there first, and they CHOSE to build there anyways.
I hope at 12.0 levels LA
Sooooo. If say an explosion on the fault line happened would that hurry it off into the deep? 😂🤣
I wouldn't mind seeing a lot less hateful Democrats but I wouldn't want to see it done this way. You guys stay safe and pray.
So I randomly paused this video at 10:11 when my wife came up to talk to me. When I turned back around I noticed something. It looks to me like the solid rock of the Earth was hit with something at that point which caused it to crack. It just looks like an impact point to me... who knows?
It is Ma-rin with the rin as in inside.  Ma as in mother.  Emphasis on the rin.

There's another way of thinking that many geologists, scientists believe is the actual truth and there's more evidence for this theory. See Bryan Nickel YT channel and watch his 6 part video and see what you think. It changed me forever.
I'm just here doing my homework :(
I feel they have these fault-lines boobytrapped so they can trigger them at will.
It’s most interesting how the years pass and we know it’s coming the outcome of the quake isn’t the issue it’s the devastation of the situation. God Bless us all...
It can't happen too fast for the rest of the US.
Sorry, SoCal earthquake deaths were due to substandard construction. Oil drillers injecting salt water or fracking water cause earthquakes, known since 1971. South end of fault ends in Salton Sea, Colorado, bay so water enters South end of Fault. Serpentine, Meercham (rock that flows like toothpaste under pressure) is formed by subduction water reacting with mantle rock.

The first question I think of is not about when this disaster will hit again, it's why the F would you rebuild a city back on top of it.
Now that I think about it there could be a earthquake in Parkfield  right after 2024.
That would have been a amazing coincidence if it happened on 2002 which is my birth year.
1934 and 1966 those years are the birth years of my relatively recently late grandfather and my dad respectively.

It couldn’t happen soon enough
Not soon enough, that's for sure.
Either the sky is falling or the ground is crumbling, it’s a wonder life ever magically spawned from rocks and survived 4.5 billion years ~
It's crazy to me that people in California feel tremors on a regular basis. Here in Ohio, we had a 3.5 earthquake under Lake Erie in 2019. At 27 years old that was my very first experience with the feeling. At the time it was early in the morning and I just thought to myself, that was strange just to find out later it was an actual earthquake. I guess it's an even trade off that we get radical tornados here on occasion.
California is still waiting for San Andreas Fault Earth's crust.

Never let me know what else I will come to your house no it’s with me I said come to your house because if I come to your houseAnd I’m feisty than you think
Not only should the engineering of the sky scrapers be built to withstand massive earthquakes but I believe new projects should be done in order to prevent all the tall buildings from falling over perhaps every single building should all be attached with solid steel beams with shock absorbers at multiple locations at the roof and mid sections and at the outskirts of each tall building should have a 45 degree angle type of steel beam with shock absorbers like a pyramid formation connecting from each building to the ground that way all the buildings are connected together and have a nice sturdy foundation and they will all then be held together so as long as they dont implode they should be able to withstand a massive earthquake your welcome
No such thing as EARTH. There is no void. Outside our Dome is the Moon's surface. The MOON has one side because all reflections do.
I predict a Major earthquake by the end of December 2020 @  Richter scale of 7.9, as it will arrive very shortly and thousands will lose their lives. The state of California is the fifth largest economy in the World and it will have a devastating cynical affect on the Nations wealth.
Is CJ there?
Nobody thought New England would get one. I should know! My son, and I had been running errands all morning, we stopped for lunch, and he took a nap. I was folding laundry, and heard a loud rumbling. I thought thunder, not a cloud in the sky. Then I said a big truck, no traffic. All of a sudden the house tipped up off it's foundation, before settling dowm again. For weeks after we had after shocks, one was strong enough to throw me out of a chair I was sitting in, watching television

Well you could watch dutchsinse on YouTube he’s been accurate about the size and with in a hundred miles around 90% of the time but you’re mad scientists have been trying to get him to shut up and go away for about 8 years now. The frauds don’t like people who have been saving people’s lives all over the world and he’s been demonetized so basically he’s doing it for free while these so called experts have been charging millions and all we got from them is that maybe in the next 30 years we might get a big earthquake or not but it could happen. You should make a video about Duch it would be interesting to see someone who at least has an idea that you can prove instead of vague guesses.

Good luck CA.  Our government has not been able to adequately deal with this pandemic.  They’ll surely not be able to deal with a large natural disaster such as a major earthquake.  All they will want to do is argue, insult, and point fingers.

When it goes there will be 24 million people cut off. No power, except solar.  no water, no gas, no sewers, no freeways, no gas stations,  floods from broken dams, there are 4 reservoirs within 20 miles of the fault north of los angeles.

As a Californian I grew up with this knowledge. When 2020 hit I had to move my family out of  beautiful California. I noticed past two yrs plus a big difference in our weather. Nothing like as a child . And all I seen this year alone god just moved me out . For safety . All we have to do is listen to our father.
I have been rooting for the fault line for the past 30+ years. The ultra liberal trash residing there needs a good shaking.
Earth:..the San Andres is a major earthquake fault line  Humans:...great let's build major cities on it..🤦‍♀️
The more little quakes the better, relieves the pressure. So the little quakes are good news.

Hopefully it'll swallow up these wicked politicians over there
A key fact people are missing is be ready for the unknown.  Due to the large population density more will be killed, injured.  I feel fairly safe living on the western flank of the Sierra Nevada foothills, but there are quake line in the mountains as well.
So --- if we start fracking on the fault with talc instead of water, would that help?  Treat the plates before they jump.
I an trying to see the downside to this. The left coast need to be cleansed.....it is a lib infested cesspool.

This doesnt even speak of the seriousness of this quake. It puts it very lightly.
California is not the only state thatvwill be effected. Utah. Colorado, arizona, most of Florida, the sea board of Texas...part of Arkansas sending water all thevwaybto Michigan, some of the northern waterway states. Mississippi. This thingbwill be so massive...that itbwill wipe out all of Utah..think of all that rock and mountainous area...
What if Earth was not 4.5 billion years old was not evolving & San Andreas fault was actually the Mid-Pacific Ocean Ridge Rift Fracture Zone a 48,000 mile geological feature that winds around the Earth like a seam on a baseball?

I like to watch you channel. But why do you allow two men kissing in a commercial. That is absolutely disgusting.
james bond movie A VIEW TO A KILL  is about villain seeking to set off explosives along the san andreas fault and destroy silicon valley.
I think it's just a myth that a earthquake is going to make the whole state of California slide off into the ocean. I really don't see it happening but honestly why would you proclaim that??? It's not the ground shifting thats going to kill you it's being a big building thats going to crumble on you thats going to kill you.
The Three Gorges dam will probably fail at the same time just because.
An earthquake woke me up this morning hahaha it was a sign that I needed to do stuff and not sleep
Did they say that guys name was  Hugnuts? What a name. You know he got messed with in school.  Hug Deez Nuts
The San Andreas fault is effectively stuck. I do not believe it’s going to rupture in the way that they claim it’s going to. However, if it does, I think it will set of a chain reaction of events, from The Cascadia subduction zone to Long Valley to Yellowstone. It would be catastrophic.
AND  millions still live there then cry and whaaaa waaahhh  booo hooo when this happen knowing its going to heppen
Next great earthquake is gonna be is when they attack Isreal it will be ALL OVER THE WORLD remember
Earth, a 4.5 billion year planet, this is fairy tale time.
If the San Andreas  fault line goes it very well could activate  the Cascadia  fault line as well which then Washington  ,  Oregon,   ,and California  ,  everything west from  Interstate  5 will collapse  into the Pacific Ocean  .... From Portland Oregon  😯
It's funny how much more destruction is coming all the time from hurricanes and yet conservative outlets like history try and talk about cali being in trouble.  Look at the rest of the shores of the eastern and southern united states if you want people to see people living in peril. History channel you've become a propaganda factory ,  leaving out truth when convenient to make your myth stronger.
OH please. They have been saying this for YEARS, AND STILL the BIG one has not hit. It WILL someday but until then STOP THE FEAR MONGERING!!!!!
This would instantly make 2020 all better. Let's pray it drops that whole God forsaken dumpster state fire into the ocean. Then we can work on the east
May Our LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST protect you and your loved ones from the earthquake and other things. Have a earthquake kit and be prepared but most importantly be right with God because you never know the day your going to meet him 🙏☝️✝️

I so wish California would have “the big one” and fall off into the ocean!
Maybe the  big one will take out the entire Left coast and the Demokrauts with it.
Its going to happen soon and why do think there are so many fires for 2020 and 2021 🤯😳🙏🙏🙏
So if this impending quake is going to be so bad, would it be felt on the east coast?
In the beginning, God created heaven and the earth.

To eliminate some fires, they should come up with vibration detecting gas valves that would close gas lines in the event of an emergency like this. At least then, only minor amounts of gas would escape fueling fires.....
"The San Andreas Fault: Disaster About to Strike" Been hearing that since the early 90's....
There will be major earthquakes during the end times, the Bible has all the answers.  Believe in Jesus! He loves you and died for you. Come as you are.. it doesn’t matter who you are or what you’ve done, Jesus is patiently waiting with open arms for you to come back to Him!  Accept his free gift of salvation! 🎁  He loves you and gave His life for you. Repent. For He is coming back soon and if He is not in your heart , you will be left behind .

@15:21 "It's molecular structure means that..." No. This is a mistake. It's NUCLEIC structure means that, i.e. having too many neutrons in the nucleus causes ATOMIC instability, not molecular instability--except of course for in that final moment when one of its extra neutrons finally turns into a proton, and it becomes Nitrogen 14 instead. There is virtually no effect at all on its molecular structure until this final moment, and so it behaves like any other carbon inside our cells, forming the exact same molecules, and only rarely turning into nitrogen and probably causing terrible damage in whatever cell it was in when that happens. But mostly, this happens after we die as mentioned.  Good try ol' chaps. Good try.  But seriously, you should have a team of scientists and engineers (grad students even) meet over Zoom to fact check all of your copy.  You could surely afford it. And I mean real scientists and engineers, not those cranks that churn out Ancient Aliens.

The upside if this does happen, is we get rid of Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters in one shot.
Yeah  yeah, yeah  for years they been saying that. I hope I see it before I die.

This isn't the one we should be concerned about. Before Jesus Christ returns a worldwide quake will occur. The San Andreas fault is just peanuts compared to the worldwide quake strikes.

The San Andreas fault is enormous and is accompanied by side faults.  The next quake could happen under the sea or in (almost) uninhabited desert.   The rocks don't know that cities are there, and they aren't aiming for them.
I feel like the history Channel knows something we don't

Thank!

I fly planes without an engine!!😉
Can't happen soon enough California needs to float off into oblivion far as I am concerned.
in California we all live with the big one will happen we just pray and hope that it will not happen when we are taking a s??? or driving. all of my life i heard my parents talking about the big one I do not think I will see it in my life time.
I am surprised that the snowflakes haven’t blamed this on “climate change” lol
I heard CA will fall in the ocean by a great earthquaje
99% chance in the next 30 years. When was this filmed? 1990?
NOW, ITS OUR PART TO MOVE AWAY FROM FAULT!!
Yes it is and it's coming sooner than all knows. Earth is fixing to go through the biggest shift in 100 years. Also people need to pay attention to how same events happen in-between the total solar eclipse that happens every 100 years. Bible refers them to as plauge and it it refers this time to tribulation. It has happened over and over and will continue. If people don't wake up our future generations will endure what we have between 2117-2124.

I hope this happens sooner than later. Get on with the show. that way we can have an act of God to blame on Smokin' Joe Biden's administration.

The Bible speaks of an earthquake that will be felt around the whole earth. Perhaps the san andreas will be the epicenter. Revelation 16:18 states: "And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great."Two verses later, Revelation 16:20, it reads: "And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
I've been in every major earthquake in Cali for the last 50 years. All of them. Northern and Southern. I have quite a knack! We'll be fine.
Jesus is coming!!! ❤️

We had an earthquake in Massachusetts a few weeks ago, actually  2 in a row it was not something common for us, not at a 4.0 , it shook the houses,  it was a little scary,  i can't imagine a major one! But im getting a feeling we are getting a big one soon!! And the whole  country will feel it , my work is right on the fault line
I'm wondering if this is when the massive planted bombs go off. Weather warfare?
As a californian this would be more of a blessing than a disaster!!! We are already living in a disaster and anything to help bring it down would be welcome.More cites destroyed the better!!!!
Im 55 and they have been talking about CA falling off into the ocean ever since I can remember. Atleast 50 years.
From the timing of previous quakes, I noticed that there is a correlation with LAND TIDES (from the moon) that might trigger highly stressed areas.  All they may need is that little extra "bump" to set them off.  While Earthquakes cannot be predicted, The danger might be especially high when the land tide put extra stress on already stressed areas.  The least the cities could do is make sure fire trucks and emergency vehicles are parked out of doors and other preventive emergency measures taken when the area is to be affected by land tides.       In the 1971 quake I noticed it happened the night of a FULL moon and lunar eclipse at a time where tidal forces peaked(Around 6 am)  That inspired me to check moon position on previous quakes.---  I went back and noticed the tidal forces(no eclipse then) were also at maximum (from moon position) in the quake that happened in the 1930s  Also there was a tidal correlation with the San Francisco quake in 1906---         Periods of maximum compression or tension from Land tides might indeed be a trigger in many cases of earthquakes in California.   Sorry ,I have not followed up, but this should be looked into. (I am a Geologist, BTW)
Anyone remember the movie Earthquake about 40 years ago? I've never wanted to go to California.
It will not be 30 years. What about this year?
Serves them right for all that voter fraud.

This is more drama than science. I was in Hollister in the early 80's. (I think it was 1982) I was fishing 1/2 mile away when the Hollister 6.4 Quake hit. I lived most of my life in So Cal. Was in Riverside for the 7.1 hector mines quake, 7.4 Landers, 6.9 Big Bear and the North ridge quake and many more. L.A. is a long way from the San Andres fault. Distance matters with quakes. San Andres fault is more of a danger for San Bernardino ,North to Victor Ville , South to Riverside, East to Cali Mesa, and West to Ontario. But L.A. is more dramatic. And there are more than one large faults in Southern California. They all play a part in relieving the stress and in creating it. I've never seen a bush catch on fire due to a quake and I doubt any gas lines were broke 3000 years ago.

Let's end 2020 with a bang fam
I have been hearing this all my life. This year I turned 70.  Still waiting......
No they moved because they knew what was going to happen in this election with all the fraud and now there worried about higher taxes Canada #1 sweet people my opinion best people in the world 🌎
Looking at Geological movement and earth movement....Something is happening......
Scientists be giving 2020 too many ideas...
More dangerous than the Yellow Stone volcano? Because that will start time all over on Planet Earth as well.
One day, someone will be watching this video while it happens.
It's just prophecy....Jesus is coming back soon whether u believe it or not...

Hopefully it happen exactly where silicone valley is with everyone all of them executives and all at work ! Then they’ll be gone !! Bye bye

Maybe our wish will come true and California will finally slip into the ocean never to be seen again. What a glorious event that would be.
If the big one is coming, why are there 40 million ppl still living there? If you see danger coming your way, what would you do?
Does that mean rap music is coming to an end?Oh the HUMANITY!
I'm so thankful this "investigation" figured out plate tectonics and the San Andreas fault.
Get rid of nancy pelosi once and for all, and the always guaranteed 55 electoral votes for the loony left !!
Not an ugly scare its just nature creating a path like a shock absorber to create less damage.

Next time I argue with my friends, I’m gonna blame it was Andreas fault! 😂😂😂😂😂 Gosh, I always wanted to say that! 😬

this would be awesome for the country, cali is full of communist.
2020, am I right?
Gavin Newsom says if you take off your mask and go to a large gathering at a French restaurant it won't happen.
It's just California, who cares...
It will happen in 522 years and 2 months
But it would be kind of funny if all the toilet paper people are hoarding literally caught on fire.
Well 2020 would just be the most splendid year ever recorded wouldn’t it?
The way the pacific states are being run a earthquake would be only improvement
GOD is about to get mad. Democrats keep lying and stealing.
One factoid here so erroneous!! In 1957 there was a significant earthquake in San Francisco and surrounding areas- I was 7 years old. The ground shook for days w/aftershocks. I can still see the NEWSPAPER HEADLINE: EPICENTER WAS HOLLISTER. I can still see the headline in my mind!!!
The ugly scar on the landscape is California.
I wish the earth would just swallow that sh it hole already.
The earth is 6000 years old
if you say it often enough over many decades it’s bound to come true 😂
In Mexico's  Pacific coastal states it shakes very often. The strongest earthquake I was in, was the 8.0 in the Richter scale in Mexico in September 1985. The earth moved in wave like manner. It was  really scary, and thousands lost their lives in Mexico City.
We all gotta go sometime. Best be prayed up b4 my days up

Who uses an explosive and expects there to not be a super sonic shock wave ?
Atleast they warned us various times before it happens.
Can’t imagine topping Gavins n Pelosi disaster. More like liberal shake down! This state is truly crazy
Be great to see lessons on climate change going back 1000s of years to see real perspective
I wonder if the holes of below street level skyscraper floors nullify or twist some of the fault torque
Go go san andreas, drop it all in the ocean wash it clean again.
That was made 2009er
Save yourself the time fast forward to the only true prediction this show makes 44:40
Why do people like Cali so much?? I'd like to keep my house for more than a few decades.
43:15 “TENS OF BLOCKS”  WTF DOES THAT MEAN OH YEAH NOTHING JUST ANOTHER TALKING HEAD HAPPY TO SAY WHATEVER THE SHOW WANTED HIM TOO SAY
Really interesting to see the visible separation of the rocks and riverbeds over time due to the movement of the Earth.
There are many things he can predict over many decades LOL i can predict better than that heres 1 i predict a million people will die in the next year  WHAT A JOKE
27:00 THE REALTY IS MOST SCIENTISTS SURVIVE OFF GRANTS FROM GOVERNMENT MEANING OUR TAXS GO TO THERE ADVENTURES AND THIS GUY PUTTING HIS HANDS ON THE SAMPLE AND SMILING PROVES HES A JOKE SCIENTIST TO EXCITED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL AND NOT CONTAMINATE WHAT OUR TAX DOLLARS PAID TO GET
Is it having any help to do so, sweety ?
25:10  scientist “ BUT IT WAS LATE “  the truth is the scientists were way wrong again like usual.
Look at the bright side.  The casualties will be a tiny fraction of that of COVID-19.
Let's hope California sinks
Yea so start counting years now
Rut Row. This documentary fits the nightmare I've been having the last couple of months. After watching this I can hear between the lines of the specialist talking...."Brace-Brace-Brace". 72 lives lost in 94 I think. 72,000 this next go around. Stay if you want, but don't cry when it slaps you down. At least stay away from tall buildings and all overpasses. You just might make it.
Bye California 👋. Your real estate is overpriced anyway
10 million years right?
The History Channel offices were in California, they moved them to Canada about three months ago. 🥸
Stop giving 2020 ideas.
My little hometown of Hollister we finally made it lol If anyone wonders if we have a crazy earthquakes here the answer is yes.....
Wait a sec. The narrator, we'll call him Ed, said that there were still Woolly Mammoths in N Amer 3.5 thousand years ago? That seems a bit late, doesn't it? Whatchoo talkin' about, Ed?
Well, that will shake a lot of people out of their fake realities, literally.
Who else watching at 2am ??😂
2020 is not over guys we still have 31 more days, let's all pray and keep our fingers crossed the this doesn't happen in December, also God be with all of us 🙏
Wow, the “History” channel talking about history.    Go figure.
Hence why I wouldn't purposely live near water or earthquake prone cities...yet thats where all the celebrities live and richer people...just waiting for doom like fools
Sorry but no one will miss the garbage that comes from that god forsaken state
the long generation of man
a Major Earthquake on The San Andreas Fault will come in 2025/2026 believe me
Excellent documentary.
If it did happen it wil also trigger the tsunami in the water
It's tough to make an educated guess when the big earthquake will happen in southern california.lets hope it doesn't happen in this century.
You should not have built a city on top of it then so it's your own faults for doing so
Nothing has probably been more catastrophic or will devistate as much life as Fukushima. People really know nothing about it, which is sad and scary all at the same time.
So want you get everyone out and. Force. The quake to go off with explosives and nobody would be hurt or killed.
I hope so.
Must be racist.
How far up the coast?  Will it also reset Portland and Seattle?
We can only hope It will take most of California and some of the other crazies on the west coast to the center of the earth .
If you clean a window or a mirror and before you dry it you rub a finger down the glass. Start putting pressure against the wet glass and as you do your finger will start to make a squeaking sound and there is small vibrations in the skin of your fingers touching the glass. I think most of us know this. Now, if we imaging the glass and our finger are the land masses and the vibrations you feel in your fingers is the equivalent to earthquakes. As you put more pressure on the glass as you push to slide you finger gets harder and suddenly it slips and goes farther than from a slip at a lower pressure, say a 3.0 or 4.0.
China owns most of it they can afford it !
The left are going to blow up an underground nuke inside the San Andreas ... Get ready for it ... The left trive on disaster and people suffrage
why not? every thing else  has happened in 2020..
Can we just pencil this disaster into 2025? We need a break.
Will that fault break away already!!!!!!! Tired of hearing about how any day now we gonna fall into they ocean!!! GTFOH!!!!!
🎶 Hello from 2020, I must move an entire country, to tell you, I'm stupid, for digging up sand, and you all will bury, because of their hands. 🎶 lmao. Sorry, couldn't resist such a thing. Because on top of continents moving, they keep digging all of the sand out of the ocean to make roads, buildings (concrete) and such and here's exactly what happens. This plus that, equals even more major disasters. From earthquakes to places getting covered entirely by water. Theres evidence all over if you look on google earth of entire islands, roads and more sitting at the "bottom" of the ocean, I highly doubt people went down there and made these huge things just so we can see it on google Earth....Atlantis?  Separate bodies of water are coming together as one, as well.  Not trying for a debate, just trying to put some info out there.
Why do people insist on living in that area if its history of earthquakes and destruction and deaths is so known? Nobody should live there
That was awesome.
You lost me at 4.5 billion years. TOTAL BS to follow...
Emp? DEW? Or MUDFlood??
My question is .... how long ago was this made the equipment they’re using his old the video clips are old we haven’t use those buses in San Francisco since the 80s can we get a more up-to-date video. I mean this video was just posted a week ago with 869,000 views did they dig it up from An old vault 🤦🏼‍♂️
Well California wanted to succeed and be a leftist utopia now hopefully they can also be a island.
The San Francisco earthquake would have been a land surveyor nightmare for years and years
We CAN predict when an earthquake will hit.. and Dutchsinse has proven this. The USGS (and others) HATE him for this, and are continually trying to get  his channel taken down here, and have at times succeeded.
Why the dramatic music for a program which is pretty accurate historically and scientifically.
Dutchsinse has a good record of predicting earthquakes.
It's 2020, this would not surprise me at all.
Why was this released today? Is YT trying to tell us something?
Just need the Rock and we will be good to go.
The only thing That hasn’t happened in 2020 oh an a supervolcano eruption 🌋
This is trending now.. wait until 2023. That north pole is moving pretty fkn fast.
Why is it taking so long? Come on, God, get busy! Arizona Bay, the serene paradise...
Hope it happens SOON and takes all the SCUM with it!!!
.... documentary's over a decade old.... and still holds up....
only the music worked the narrative didn't
A highly fascinating series of advertising punctuated by occasional scientific and geophysical information.
Earth is NOT 4.5 BILLION years old. Its only 6,000 years old. Humans showed up 4,000 years ago. Who agrees with me that GOD created EVERYTHING?
I Hope This Happens,  Then Everyone Can Come Back To Reality!
Watch emergency management associate ron Tyler go back few months   nine point two Alaska look back on show on YouTube a lot happen for weeks they do have a lot of volcanoes check his site.  All so dutchsience on  youtube.  Allot of people have moved after recent fires.  Do your research.
Like the movie with “The Rock” in it ?
Finally something that is actually worthy of trending on YouTube
When you release an 11 year old show it is only proper to tell people that. Maybe the first air date on TV or the date on the video which is 2009. To release a video as new only to find it is old gets you a million views. Fraud.
It kills me to hear this gentleman throw around the millions of years comments. He has no idea whatsoever how long anything took.  pulease.....
Can we applaud the fact that HISTORY channel is trending rn
These days mother nature is no competition for the death that man has, does and can do to fellow humans. I don't fear earthquakes even with all your doom and gloom. It is a false fear. Just release a virus and create a pandemic. Just take away our freedoms and people will commit suicide anyway. Death cannot come soon enough. Soon we will be welcoming tsunamis to take us out of our pain.
That dude ran right through that stop sign
Coming up next election year: THE BIG EARTHQUAKE!
And yet California gets more and more expensive
Oh well
Would any other America be sad if California broke off and sunk in the Pacific ocean?
Knowing what I know about California, I'm half expecting a volcano or lava flow in my life time in Eastern California. Also out there is Garlock Fault and the activity in Owens Valley.
It can happen in the twinkling of an eye..  Always be ready!🙏🌹
Dinosaur blood sitting under miles of rock formations for kazillions of years would be useable.
Please God let it happen soon. We are tired of commiefornia.
It took 3 1/2 years to dig it up. Its imperative we dont touch it. Ok. Ok. Everyone come touch it. ???
About every hundred years or so Mother Nature tries to remind us of the past with a little nudge. When we ignore her she comes down on us like a Banshee. You forget the Spanish flu, I'll send you Covid-19.  We're a stubborn bunch, living on that fault line is like a dare to her, hopefully she's busy else where.
What's up with the sub titles all of a sudden on every video ...the subtitles are not even correct either. Anyone else seeing this or is this just a setting on the videos I accidentally   activated
I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA FOR 65 YEARS AND I HAVE ONLY FELT ONE EARTHQUAKE ! SO MUCH FOR FAKE NEWS!
Devour the silicon valley🙏🏻
I am not too worried even though a branch of the San Andreas fault is literally about 30 feet from my house. A quake on the San Andreas fault would be like a small after shock compared to the Cascadia Subduction Zone going off.
so is this the waring or faulse avid?? cuz people living along the west coast. are now confused cuz 1 min it wont happen then next u guys posting this lol sad
100 million years. 😄
2020, am I right?
This is probably a stupid question, but... I'm gonna ask it anyway and hope maybe someone will know the answer.   Is it possible that the change in the relative regularity of the shifts (every 200 years-ish to over 300 years and counting) could, in part, have to do with a change in the weight of the continental plates? Would the current weight of our civilization, compared to the limited civilization which existed here 300+ years ago, significantly impact the weight of the continental plates we exist upon?
I hope it's big and I hope it's soon.
Strangely, I have heard  from another video I’ve watched, that just before an earthquake a flashing of lights occur.
How can the narrator be. So. Dramatic. for 45 minutes? With the music, it's too much for me.
i wish that a disaster would happen and take out all the prophets of doom and destruction. we all only have 20 years to exist that is updated every 30 years.
It's just prophecy....Jesus is coming back soon whether u believe it or not...
The sky is falling! The Sky is falling!  Because, fear gets ratings.
Tells you it's a theory and people block it out and swallow hook line and sinker.
Nick Zentner, Central Washington U. The guy lays it all out, and then some.
THIS IS REALITY....
0:04.  "Earth, a 4.5 billion year old planet, still evolving. As continents shift and clash, volcanoes erupt, and glaciers grow and recede . . ."  Still evolving, still here after all that, but now if the temperature goes up by a few degrees centigrade, it's the end of everything.  Riiiiiiiight.
why don't they start moving people out it's going to take 15 years to move people out instead of wait until it kills people move the whole darn City start doing it
This is real rock n' roll
well the ambient music was extremely moving thru out the 1st 2 anda half minutes  ... very impressive ... i suppose the rest is just speculation ?  ha
Would these people bother to repent,,,,,,,????? Nah, it'll be fine.
Time for god to move in California. Judgement day is coming 😁
A riot backwards. Get the results with no effort.
With all the evil going on in our nation, especially with California, just look at what has hapened to its people directly at the hands of Pelosi and her cronies, they are so power hungry, just maybe God is going to show them who is the most powerful. I truly believe that a sinfilled nation of power loving lawmakers will bring God 's wrath upon us all.
But you people could start telling the citizens of that area, how much magma is filling the volcanoes. Plus stop turning down the seismographs!!! Start being honest to the people!! Their lives depend upon their knowledge!!!
4.5 billion years lmfao
December 2nd
If this happened today they would blame President Donald Trump. When this happens Hollywood elites will know what it's like to be homeless.They will struggle to get a grip on reality and begin to wonder why they spent the last 4yrs of their lives hating Our President, and really doing nothing else. I almost fell sorry for them.
Thats going to displace a lot of Democrats which will destroy the rest of the nation.
This is it !!!! It's the BIG ONE, ELIZABETH  !!!!!!!
Noah's flood wasn't a million years ago but thousands , they see how that one event quickly reveals the truth .
Elon musk Lives there and he ain’t Scared ....
Very informative 👏.  Great background music 🎶.
Why the hec would people want to continue living there.
Stupidest decision by the worlds smartest people. Jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) the NASA  behind NASA is built less than 1/2 mile aloug the fault.
Dutchsiense! ❤🌍
Gawd👀🌍shake it up San ie!!!😬
I'm sorry but Hollywood needs to sink into the ocean...
I hope it would cause the hole state of shitafornia to fall off in to the ocean
There is no record to date the earth billions of years...
Trump said these are radical, leftist plates and we should nuke them. Scientists say it would cause a tsunami which, from a standpoint of water would be very wet. It's important to have wet water,.
Am anticipating how much does the earth goes through changes. Can't wait for pangaea to become one continent as 3 countries merge. Am living on a fault line.  I am ready for the great change in the future.
Democrats are drooling over the Federal Disaster Money that they can steal half of....     Look what Democrats did with the Haiti disaster money... .   $10 Billion disappeared PDQ !..   Zero help to Haiti.. California will be a grab bag of Billion$..
Why are you showing photos of the’89 quake that occurred in San Francisco while showing photos of the Northridge quake at ~37  minutes?
Same old trip it was back then
FOR 55 YEARD I HAVE HEARD THESE SAME WORDS EVERY YEAR!
I was in the 89 quake. It was a hum dinger I'll never forget.
south of San Francisco there is a big reservoir called Chrystal Springs in a valley. The San Andreas runs right through the valley. there are some bike and running trails and at one point, they cross the lake and therefore also cross the fault. You can stand on the trail with one foot on the Pacific plate and the other foot on the North American plate.
san andreas the movie in the making in real life
if this big one hits, itll be a perfect way to cap off 2020
Watch DUTCHSINSE on YouTube, he can tell you when to expect an earthquake!
Good wakeup call for Governor Newsome and Speaker Nancy Polosi right? Shakem up! Wakem up!
The crazy thing is I'm born and raised in the bay area. I live 1 hour  north of the fault. Just my luck lol
Visit the website of the California Earthquake Authority and learn about earthquake safety, strengthening your home and earthquake insurance.  See if you are even near a fault.  Take control; don't just let people scare you.
More dangerous than a Yellowstone eruption?
Well I'm glad I live in Tx
And San Andreas is a kitten compared to the Pacific monster fault...the crust is being crushed and forced under another contental plate...major subduction zone....a few hundred miles off the cost of Alaska down to Mexico....it would likely set off San Andreas...and tsunamis. .....look it up.
🛡️⚔️🗣️{It moves by inch every second, remember You don't notice it because your senses Aren't On All The Time. And It's Almost Here, And When it does I Will Not Summit To Government Bull 💩."}🔥📯⚔️🛡️
If ur heart and soul belongs to Jesus Christ, all this will not concern you.  Everyone either belongs to Jesus or to Satan.  You choose to do good or evil.  The New World Order is Planned to start making ppl to go search for worldly pleasure, which only lasts for a short time. Go to God.....
Can’t see it from my house.
With all the oil drilling, near the fault lines, any chance that the drilling might be making some of the tensions released, in bits,-than having  a major  strong earth quake? I get it that  deep down, the  earth plates are moving. I just pray that all the thousands of drilling doesn't make the collateral damages worse .
I hope this never happens. They are so many kids that live on top of that fault.
Disaster movies usually portray it happens on a work day.  21-23?  Possibly.  ( 2012, San Andreas, Earthquake, Deep Impact.  )
As long as all of my family and God fearing law abiding citizens leave safely let the state sink
I will do my best to act  sad if it happens. If I will just be able to get the stupid grin off my face.
Aloha from Phoenix Arizona. I'm thankful that I Left California State and was forced to move to Roseville CA POLICE DEPARTMENT BEAT ME UP AND ARRESTED FOR A 7 YEAR OLD WARRANT AND EXTRADITED TO ST LOUIS COUNTY JAIL. 63 DAYS WITHOUT MEDS AND NOW I AM STUCK HERE IN PHOENIX. Can't wait to Get out of here by myself and get back to Home. Where's home 🏡 I know that but no one will ever know where to go from here. Good luck EARTH 🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎
Uber-drama over evidence that any 7-year old could easily assimilate. History Channel read my lips: Please tell us something we don't already know, and do it without the excessive drama.
Heard this my entire life
Tried to watch, but too many ads made it unwatchable.
Given the actions and beliefs of people in 2020, it is not unreasonable to believe that in the near future, if by some miracle scientists were able to predict "the big one" to within a week with 99% certainty, and the information was put out months in advance, a significant portion of the population would call it "fake" and turn to actual "fake news" sites, rightwing pundits, faux religious personalities, and conspiracy theorists who will reassure them that it's all an evil plot by [ insert bogieman of the moment here ] and will urge them to "rise up" and demonstrate for their "rights" and "freedoms".
The city is the ugly scar
These fascinating ads keep getting interrupted by this annoying documentary.
This background music is exhausting.
Underwater “vibration”
Another good reason not to go west of Mississippi.
Arizona bay!!! Am i right? Fingers crossed.
Maybe it's not such a bad thing if California resets.
Gotta pay extra for everything in Cali because the rich will know before the average people so they can collect the money and bounce somewhere else and leave the poor to fall into the center of the earth 😂
There was a Catholic seer in 80’s, living in U.S. God the Father allowed her to see that there will be a great earthquake, San Francisco will be swallowed up, nothing will be left. Then wars will be in progress. Pray the *Rosary* everyday, so God will have mercy, because this message is conditional.
Very interesting!Enjoyed thus information!
I though California renamed the San Andreas Fault,   to Trumps Fault.
Maybe this will happen only under all the DemonRats Homes starting with Newsom then Pee Liser, Feinstein, maxine Waters 😂😂😂Well  the ground opens up and sucks them all in and BURIES   them alive ha ha Ha🥰😂😂
Want everlasting security ? “Seek ye first,.. (in all things,) the kingdom of God and His righteousness “  NOTE: MUCH OF MY COMMENT WAS EDITED BY SOMEONE ,.... WHY????
According to one video I saw a time traveler said that United States would go threw several major natural disasters between 2020 and 2025 that would reshape the USA. He made it clear most of California sinks into the Ocean and that country was spit into two. Used to think he was nuts but now I wonder.
Seems every year they say this, eventually they will get it right.
Well if biden is going to pres. Then there is no worry there will be no earthquacks no hurricanes  the covid will magically disappear and so on don't u know this so in 2 months will be good
the same channel that brings you "ancient aliens" has no credibility, this is just junk science entertainment
..GOOD BYE EVIL TYRANTS..
In the '89 quake  standing in a doorframe.. I remember our fridge walk away from the kitchen wall. Jump in the air high enough to flip horizontal, doors open up, food and trays falling out . Then crushing itself horizontally on the ground. San Mateo , CA. I was watching the world series when it started.
These people better get right with God!
When the BIG ONE hits California, MILLIONS of Leftist Liberal Democrats will die in a scene right out of 2012 Explain to me how this will be a bad thing for this country?
It will probably happen on New Year’s Eve. 🙄
Eclipses and earthquakes for settlers hundreds and hundreds of years ago must have been terrifying.
the only problem in San Andreas is when I beat a person at a stop light, pull them out, and steal their car. After I get busted, I walk out of the police dept with less money and no court appearance. Now you tell me what the cops did with the money in my wallet? Thats the problem in San Andreas GTA.
This would definitely deal with commiefornias election fraud
How did the continents shift if they are connected to the earth. They are not floating islands 🤣🤣
Just pray and ask god should you leave pray god to lead and guide you psalms 91 23 23 121
And temperatures changes all the time the commie Democrats are just wanting our money
They should evacuate the cities along the fault and set off a chain of nukes underground to release the stress. Peaceful use of nuclear weapons! That should take care of the problem for about 300 years.
Dude we just had a 6.4 and a 7.1 in So Cal on july 4th 2019 but it wasnt in a big city that's why nothing happened 2 people died .
Conclusion:  The major earthquake WILL occur in the very near future; could be tonight or tomorrow. Los Angeles will be mostly destroyed and will require many years to rebuild.
The San Andreas is not the biggest fault in California.  That distinction belongs to the governor.
See Dutchsinse on YouTube or Twitch for excellent forecast predictions based on the Dutch model.
You mean a 2,000 to 3,000 year old planet I’m sorry but us Christians don’t believe scientist LIES
This is really old
Absolutely fascinating. I think geology is more interesting than archeology. Archeology is the past and geology is the future.      Is Arizona in danger?
I NO IT COULD NOT HAPPEN IN A BETTER PLACE.
Documentaries have been coming out about this fault and the next big one for decades.
shake and bake...I remember as a kid going to see both movies in one night...Towering Inferno and Earthquake
No telling, but I'm sure it and all other faults will give way at the great earthquake before His return
Yup world ends before 2045
this was going to happen right before the Lord returns
it will go in the next 2 years
take all leftists with it..
We probably need a Reset
The rest of the Demoncrat party needs to hold its supposed victory party right in the  middle of the fault line .
Hurry up and let coastal california slide silently off into the abyss along with all the liberal scum !
Gods revenge on California will be devastating!
99 percent chance that the big one will happen within the next 30 years... You're welcome.
I would venture to say, given the current data, within the next 9 years.🤔
Thank you for airing this.  Interesting and terrifying.   Godspeed
Niice 😊
Wow the History Channel can hardly wait.
lies abound
learn how to pronounce "Marin" next time
And remember the experts had signs at national parks telling us the glaciers would be gone by now, they took them away; wonder why?  They are fear mongering that is all the MSM does, divide this, fear that all day every day.
30:23 Thanks, captain obvious! 🤣👍
I thought it would happen be for the next President takes office either TRUMP OR Biden i have had other things in the past that god has told me earth Quakes in Iran i new about it 2 hours before it happen  Rev Mike Church of the Light
Hope all the Dem's are at pucklosi's house eating icecream.
Can we applaud the fact that HISTORY channel is trending rn
A "Great Cleansing" in the works?

4:48 Imagine the force required to flip a statue upside down.
Hopefully I'm not in CA anymore before this happens
There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. - Luke 21:25 There are only two signs in the entire Bible called "great signs" (σημεῖα μεγάλα in the Greek) and these are found in Revelation 12:1–2 and Revelation 15:1. These catastrophes are only going to get WORSE!
The Seventh-day Sabbath Was Made for Everyone. A multitude of Christians call God’s fourth commandment the “Jewish Sabbath.” But nowhere is this expression found in the Bible. The seventh day is called “the sabbath of the Lord,” and it is never called “the sabbath of the Jew” (Exodus 20:10).
James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore (1877-1921), in a signed letter.  “Is Saturday the seventh day according to the Bible and the Ten Commandments? I answer yes. Is Sunday the first day of the week and did the Church change the seventh day -Saturday – for Sunday, the first day? I answer yes. Did Christ change the day’? I answer no!   “Faithfully yours, J. Card. Gibbons”
we all practice the Grate shakeout in October every year at schools hopefully we will all  be ready as much as we can
Next time I argue with my friends, I’m gonna blame it was Andreas fault! 😂😂😂😂😂 Gosh, I always wanted to say that! 😬
I would love to see this happen
Maybe will hit were Nancy Pelosi house and he nephew ha ha!!!
Maybe time to get some beachfront property ------ IN NEVADA
Ha ha, why limit it to just a few billion years, or a few hundreds of millions of years.  Why not bazillions and gazillions?  That's just about as believable.  Seriously, if you all would just stop denying creation and get rid of your religion of evolution (a cult actually), the truth would all fit together.  About 6000-7000 years ago God created everything.  Man screwed up big time and about 4000 years ago, God sent a great flood of water, not just rain but water from inside the earth, enough to flood everything and kill everything.  It stayed on the earth for about a year.  Then, when it began to recede to form the oceans, the high speed of the receding,  indescribable volume of water caused all the erosion which formed the Grand Canyon, making the even layers of sand and silt seen in the rock.  This also explains the millions of dinosaur and other fossils all found in weird groupings, many with heads and necks stretched backwards and up indicating the attempt to take in one last breath.  If you research it, instead of closing your minds to the truth, it is all very interesting and fits perfectly.  Sorry for the rant.  Evolution is so preposterous, I can't believe it has so many believers.
The Coptic calendar is arguably the oldest calendar system that is still in widespread use. It has its roots in the ancient Egyptian calendar, whose earliest documented implementations date back to the 5th millennium BCE.  Mayan calendar depicts the age dial to end 2020, December 21.. buckle up
A lot of Cali is not very good any longer, a lot of rot in the government has destroyed it.
It would be great if it was moving quicker and we found just ship Cali, Washington and Oregon up north to Canada where they and the liberal morons can stay...if you’re not a liberal or lefty, I’m sorry.
This is so wrong I hope Noone gets hurt i guess but cali needs to go lol
This is trending for a reason. Soon...
The following are happening in our world and no one is noticing.  1. Armageddon is about 4 action events.     1st horse, Bow = Send it.    2nd horse, Sword = Strike it.    3rd horse, Scales = Split it.    4th horse, Fire = Sear it.     And that ='s Our planet for the past 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.    That's hundreds of rockets we've "Send"/sent up.    They are weapons designed to stop "Wormwood" in Revelations.    All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.    Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.  2. "The mark of the beast".       Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.     But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.     The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.     It comes from Chromosome 7 lamb1.     This is the moment where the Bible mentions: You will wish the mountains to fall on you.     And this is the moment where the Bible mentions: The "few" and the "many".     "Few" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and "many" will live (billions).     This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.     This is the moment of the "delusion" mentioned in Revelations.      If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.     You will wish the "mountains to fall on you".     666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  *Six species of human corona viruses are known* ,      with one species subdivided into two different strains,          making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.     And you who think the part about the "buying and selling unless you have the mark" is a chip ..that's not right.     You have to understand the person who wrote revelations was seeing specific moments of the future.     When He saw those buying and selling who had the "mark", he was looking at those who were living during the      4 Action Events of Armageddon (see my other video please) and the 7 year reign of the antichrist. Those who are      "born again" have done been raptured away with Jesus. The body of Christ doesn't go thru those events. Only ones alive     are the ones who have LIVED who got the mark. You see, though everyone gets it..not everyone dies from it. Those who did     die are the ones who are "raptured to Jesus". The "mark" only kill the "born again" people of Jesus (see video and comments for      further understanding).    3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelations 9:10.      There are satellites in space called HIVES.    Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.    They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.    They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above.  Please I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now. I don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help  me tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered on my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read. Please at least do that.
BS DUDE! THE BIG ONE HAS BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME! TWISTED SCIENCE YOU FOLLOW FOR YOUR AGENDA! TRUTH IS HITLER FOLLOWED TWISTED SCIENCE AND IT WIPED OUT 100 MILLION PEOPLE B4 IT WAS STOPPED.
Wake up people earthquakes can be natural and controlled
Knowing all of what you know about this planet called earth , then please try and explain why Human beings are DESTROYING the planet .
They say the average family in California has enough food in their homes to last them;  3 days - Having 3 full meals and water 4.2 days having 2 meals per day but zero water by now  9 days having only 1 meal per day  11 days if they were to eat everything that is inside their pantry and refrigerator  I know families who go grocery shopping every two days. Others who shop every week and some that only shop once a month.  I’m thinking with everyone seeing what can happen when covid appeared most families are keeping their panty and refrigerators and are storing much more water. At least, I would hope
The hairs on my arms stand everytime I go to San Francisco and believe me I try never to have to go there. I hate San Francisco, I'm scared of an earthquake everytime I do need to go there!
Well, the bright side of the BIG earthquake, the cesspool known as San Francisco and Los Angeles will be cleaned!
And with all those unlucky,  they are already listed as Covid 19. Just incase.  Move along
Have you done anything on the Cascadia fault in the Pacific Northwest?
Perhaps Lex Luthor is planning to drive atomic bombs into the fault line...
when this happens people around the world will just gasp,for there is nothing else to do,the sharks will feed for a year,i don't stay in california long,when i go there, i say goodbye to my family members for real,they won't move,i think they are nuts,now i found out i live 200 miles from NEW MADRID,merry christmas you all,no where is safe
Looking forward to it
This video is 11 years old, folks...If there was a 99% chance of an earthquake on the southern Loma Prieta "in the next 30 years", and 11 years has already passed, I think that means you better move NOW
Couldn't happen to a better place!
Thanks china
We're gonna shake, rattle and roll...
I wonder how the gas pipeline will be affected when the Earth quake finally hits, along the San Andreas Fault.  If this will cause explosions that will follow thru many states with mass destruction.  The earth quake itself will affect California. But we have  Never stapled the Earth before with the pipeline.  If the plates in the Earth move, what will this natural movement in the Fault line of the Earth cause cities in the path line regarding gas pipes.  Will this cause multiple fires?  What is the great Potential of consequences to stapling the plates with flammable gas lines?   Where is the study on this?  It's a nightmare waiting to happen.   Trace Stevens  tms  poet  Ohio
Me at 2 AM watching this.
Painfully repetitive and then the wnswer is who knows
14.55 " The bare rock layers are no help in dating his find." What happened to carbon dating? I guess it never really existed ever, just a fraudulent theory , like millions of years too.
Go terrify someone else.
When it happens, blame it on Trump.  In 2021
Haha!  Nice try, El-ites.   It's game over already, just in case y'all haven't noticed.    To all the real people out there, those actually free of mind, body, and spirit:  Shows like this are called Predictive Programming.  David Icke is 100% correct.  It's classic problem, reaction, solution gameplay.  They show you what they're going to do before they do it because we live in a consensus reality, a certain number of people all have to be on board with the disaster in order for them to pull it off.
Why you people call it San andreas isn't make any sense  it is  san andreas or san andres san Andreas is for F. San Andres is m. So make up your mind!!!
Funny only tall buildings hey everyone ok
Hudnut awesome name
Predictive earthquakes, watch Dutchsinse on YT or Twitch. Great info in many topics👍 we’ve got natural movement, but we have made made issues creating our quakes
California use to be a desert 🏜 men changed major rivers to get water there. Men played god. And any thing unnatural has unnatural side affects that turn in to major things 🤔. But that couldn't be it. Good luck yall 🤦‍♂️
Only GOD Knows when this Will Happen. There are many, Many videos and SHOWS ON THE “HISTORY”  channel that are full of LIES - DECIET AND INACCURACIES. THAT I WOULDN’T BELIEVE A WORD THESE PEOPLE OR The COMPLETELY LYING AND DECEIVING SMITHSONIAN  INSTITUTE WHO HAVE COMPLETELY BLATANTLY DESTROYED SO MUCH HISTORY AMERICAN HISTORY ITS UNIMAGINABLE‼️‼️Many Huge Flat Ships FULL OF Giants BONES!!! OF Real GIANTS THAT HAVE BEEN Found Throughout THE USA‼️‼️and Around The World‼️ To PRESERVE THE FAKE DISGUSTING LIES OF “evolution” ALL FOR THE SAKE OF THE ALLMighty Evil $$$$$ They KNOW Perfectly Well GOD IS REAL!! And CREATION IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH. THATS WHY THEY DESTROY EVERYTHING TO HIDE EVERYTHING FROM THE PUBLIC!!  So Enjoy what EVER TRUTH Might be in this “Show”. They Have NO IDEA ABOUT WHEN ANYTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  THE “USGS”  IS A PATHETIC INSTITUTION of Lies AND  DECEIT AS WELL‼️
the only think thats certain  is that nothing is certain lmaooooooooooo
Why dont they ever talk about cascadia subduction zone, that is a bigger threat than san andreas and yellowstone...why not to a docu on that?
Interestingly the title implies intelligent design.✡
learn to swim
Oh, and even more recent finds link the San Andreas to the Cascadia fault, so for real fun imagine 8 to 10 *minutes* of shaking, starting  in the Aleutians and ripping all the way down to the Gulf of California, followed by aftershocks, tsunamis and possible triggering of volcanoes all along that line. Every single linked subsection of this fault system is capable of dropping a 9.0+ quake, so if all of them go, well... smoke 'em while you got 'em.   Sure hope that eased any fears this program inspired! 😎
god let it happen
Nice theory
Darn two of Americas most beloved Cities!
But we are entering the end, and we will see the earth change in extreme things will increase, and the earth will be shaken!!!
First on all, the earth is NOT billions of years old. It is younger than what their telling us. And it was created by GOD not by a big bang! Stupid!!!!
Me: I live right on top of the San Andreas Fault in Oakland. History Channel: You are in danger. Me: Yes
Who is down for getting jackhammers and speeding up the San Andreas fault line?
Well that’s one way to get rid of California
What gets me are the folks who build multimillion dollar homes on the fault line. Dumbasses.
It's All in GODS HANDS
Did an adult review this video prior to release?  Did a twelve year old provide the horrible intrusive music?  This is horrible!  We Americans simply cannot make a video without trying to get "cute" and making a mess!  Best of luck, but this is terrible.
I guess  if u followed  the biblical  translation  and transcript  , of the things to come most there best be prepared  for the unexpected
it would  be  great  if the   crack   started   in  baha  and  went to the salton  sea.  nice and  deep   making new  sea line  to  build   ocean  view  homes.
come on  1883  they knew  what caused  them  at least the  people of   the educated   did  .
Thanks!!! nice lite.  Happy Thanksgiving...happy huntin..😉
San AnDreaS FauLT  Or TrumPz FauLT??
Lol,that's funny considering it will probably drop California in the ocean.God bless everyone but Gavin Newsom
DUTCHSINSE Can predict with in a week or two and he explains in detail...check it out on youtube
When it happens...Dutchsinse will be covering it...live.
Almost time to buy property in El Centro!
I Live in Arizona. Love to have Ocean Front.
Why rhey don't do one for Mississippi fault line 17 1800.....
Can't Newsom just tax the Earth to force it to submit ?
Maybe it’ll make Arizona prime beach real estate lol 😂
Mother nature AKA GOD. I'm pretty sure Mother nature wink wink isn't happy with the so called "higher ups"  I'd leave if I could....
Cascadia over due and scarier than San Andreas, IMO
I'm so glad i see thru y'alls lies. Umm,The Creator ain't gonna be happy bout you people lying to us. Judgement day is comming,and we all have to face our judgement.
Ablazing!
coulldn't care less if it doe's  it is way over due , half of california sucks anyway's
kinda scary when you think about it
Gavin assured us, if we all stop driving cars that use gasoline, none of this will happen.
so, get to Disneyland while you can foks!
the really scary part is that here in California, if you want to find the fault, just follow the schools and hospitals, all built on cheap fault line land!
We ain't scared in California.if it shakes it shakes
I live here in Littlerock, we literally just had a 3.5 15 minutes ago the house jolted pretty hard.
I hate to say it but California is just not a safe place to live. It will soon fall off into the sea I just hope that people are smart enough to take caution in this area. its going to happen.
hopefully soon cali is dead anyway
I'm ready no choice
California disappearing would be good for the rest of the country.  Hopefully New York will disappear too.
Democratic state right?  It might do the world some good then.
We are living in Revelation times.. Its here as Virus runs its times in world....
California always trending first on the “left” coast.  I can only hope our politicians feel the disastifaction of Mother Earth, more than the common man who’s over taxed and subjected to restrictive leftist agenda.
As an American i hope California gets swallowed by the ocean... no more fires 😏
Where will the Mexicans go?  Home?
Good reason to leave and become a Republican.
So, whose fault originally was it that caused The Earth to shake and quake; was it the Serpentine Rock & its smooth talc, talk about it, it is now no fake!
i know what it is, there is still bombs in the ground from the military.
If quakes are caused from plates colliding and youre finding evidence of the ground/earth stretching.. Then that would mean the the center of the earth is getting tighter and tighter.. That would mean that technically speaking the earth would then be shaping into an hour glass..
So the grand canyon was created by erosion but the rocks in California were an earthquake even though rocks in the GC have to SAME leveled layers as rocks in CA??
The fence Was probably two guys that started on opposite ends and started to work towards the middle but somewhere one or both of them got a little crooked and then argued over who was in the right spot because neither wanted to redo any of it.
You mean to tell me that in 1906 they didn't realize an entire chunk of land just missing??? 🙄 and as for the fence.. So the earth stretched?? Maybe it was to make more room for the dummies to continue to populate? Rofl.. Stupid
Take a look at how far the North Pole has moved ,,put the pieces together n you'll get a 90°,,polar shift,,,
I predict earthquakes happen at frack shacks
GOD HAS HAD ENOUGH ,,THE WHOLE WEST COAST IS NOW A CESSPOOL,,   BEST GET RIGHT WITH GOD..EAST COAST AS WELL WE HAVE BECOME VIRTUALLY A 3rd WORLD COUNTRY.
I hope it falls into the ocean and takes all the crazy, radical leftists with it.  Killer bees, fires, disease, drugs, shootings and earthquakes (so far), hasn't done the job, yet.
What about acapulco mexico got bigger muscle rock's like those
Isaiah 20-23
Over 10. It'll sink beneath the ocean. Arizona will be ocean front.
God is in control..not the Earth!!
God made the Earth!! But this fault is in waiting..to tear the earth apart!!  Leave this area..ppl!!!
We are 11 years into that 30 year prediction. Another reason not to live there.
Yea there a reason why I move lol if u dint take this serious u be sorry later specially if u own a house
God forbid if the fault breaks would we have worry about Yellowstone🤔😳😳
Nobody know when is this going to happen God is protecting all of us
Can't wait to see it happen..☻
California would deserve it they gave us Nancy Pelosi and nephew Gavin Newsom but she would say it was Trumps fault
I enjoy this documentary until someone say or talk about millions of years ago, A human only last less then a 100 years , but they speak about a time that nobody can speak about it,, That is a serious long time nobody can really bring what was there  in the earth, But I believe in a supreme Being that keep the Universe in order, in time, Many Laws " but  man want to guess, Keep on guessing.
It amazes me the sound of a live quake.... sounds like a rumbling freight train under my feet you have to yell to talk. 1 28 1994 4:31am The walls all flex & look like a wave the sound  of cracking wood all around you. I remember running out the house only to be thrown back down to the ground in Riverside
whos at "fault"? the earth?
Out of know where I was thinking about LA and then the earthquake came to my head so I searched it up and it’s 2020 so it could hit
I'm I wrong? Didn't big earthquakes occur in both northern Cali and so cal in the 20th century???
Me in bed in San Jose during quarantine/curfew  San Andrea's Fault: oh haiii, down here.
It's 2020 This doesn't surprise me.
As an American I think more of the state would be better off. If it were in the ocean.
interesting, the study done in 2008. Old it doesn't mention the newer Ridgecrest Eq in 2019. statistics for death and injury would be much higher.
We're did they come up with all this millions of years lol check my video 📹 out on my YouTube channel you'll get a good information.
With any luck it will slide into the ocean !!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡
Are the constant rapid fire scene changes necessary?  Also, get your cameramen off of meth.  Horrible annoying.  If I want to watch strobe lights I can go to the Disco club.
I love how Pangea is still a thing today 😅🤣👻👻👻
it will hit on June 12th 2021 at 2pm it will be an 12.0 .......
Look at the Hawaii chain of islands running all the way to Russia. They have been moving on a 270 heading but for a long time they moved directly north. The ocean plate could slide north 150 feet for 3000 miles subduction zone fault and the San Andrea's could slide 150 feet north and the Cascadia fault could slide 150 feet north and push west at the same time for the subduction zone. I think it is funny you in this article only looked at the smallest part of a much greater picture. I think God is holding his anger to see if Biden is left to steals the election.
Guess I'm dead inside to disasters surprising me anymore.
FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE!  YOU SAID THAT EARTHQUAKES CAN NOT BE PREDICTED!!!  If you look at dutchsinse earthquake predictions you will find that he has watched and studied closely at earths tech tonic plates and watched the locations of these earthquakes.  If you have a quake north and another one south there is a middle point which is open and that place will strike an earthquake usually within 12-14 days with extreme accuracy.  dutchsinse has shown and proven without a doubt where the next earthquakes will be all over the entire world and they show up often within a week to 12 days!!!  IT IS TIME THAT THE USGS PEOPLE AND OTHER  EARTHQUAKE SPECIALISTS STARTING TAKING NOTES AND LEARN NEW THINGS ON EARTHQUAKE PREDCICTIONS!!  You should be paying dutchsinse to work on your team to show locations where these earthquakes will be next!!  Why - because the USGS and others have not learned to believe these studies yet!  It is like people saying the earth is flat by one persons studies while we in our modern age have learned the earth is round, egg shaped with a wobble and has tech tonic plates and the earthquakes travel on those plate boundary lines.  All quakes happen in between where the other quakes have just happened and weekly or monthly.  The USGS hates dutchsinse because he is not employed by them and has learned and proven more than they have about earthquake predictions.  What further is proven is that earthquakes often are along areas next to extremely high power line transformer poles traveling across the land.  He has also that there are 100's of thousands of oil fracking taking place and where steam is pulled from deep in earth to operate generators to produce power and earthquakes are found in those steam generator areas too!  find them on google earth and then watch and learn - same way the USGS needs to do now and swallow their pride!  SO HOW ABOUT IT USGS PEOPLE - HIRE dutchsinse to watch and help you to predict earthquakes which you are too slow to learn these things yourselves.  Why the heck is it so hard for you to understand the use of fulcrum points and where those areas will experience earthquakes soon??  To listen to the USGS in most of these studies is like people still believing in Darwin and than man came from Apes instead of from God of higher beings!!  That's right you should give dutchsinse a job to help you figure things out.  Watch and learn USGS!  LOL
Watch your domestic animals behavior......Prior the quake often       they  run away ..
Crooked covid,                 Crooked government,            Crooked e.coast hurricanes,  Crooked w.coast (whew) Ya never know, 2020 might have another surprise left!
I pray for those people that live there.
Jesus spoke the earth into existence . That's how the earth was created!! Man and his science is nothing but foolish ignorance.....
Watch it will either hit on thanksgiving day or maybe on Christmas day...  The west side of the fault line will shift north west about 10 miles.
2020 is a never ending nightmare hope no one has a time machine
If it wiped out LA, San Francisco, and San Diego it would be a blessing!
Don't worry the camera man will be okay,  he always is.
So who has this on their 2020 BINGO card?! 😅😅😅
Hey has anyone here said yet that this would fit perfectly in 2020
The earthquake struck just before dawn...yet when filming, it looks too light out to be 'before dawn.'
Can it take Nancy Pelosi when it goes?
That san Andreas fault is a disaster waiting to happen,  not a question of if either,  just a matter of when and when I say when I mean very near future.....
No one can give a definite day or year. Californians with common sense keep a go-bag with water and flashlight ready.   BTW-There HAVE been quakes in Hollister! Lots of small ones. And its pronounced Mah-Rin
Born in 65 and every decade we hear about the Big One.
Nother grand reason . . . MOVE OUTTA CALIFORNIA !,😬 🇺🇸 😝
With such an event . . . homelessness to take on horrendous proportions.  'Every man/woman, for him/herself ! 😬 🇺🇸
Any day now.
'The Big One' . . . and all those massive, high structures.  Should I get a spot . . . in the 'burbs,' front row seat to see/witness this stress releasing quake ! Hmmmmmm . . . . . . . .😎😝😬
Only 36 days left of 2020, don't do it!
U think 2020 bad ..wait till 2021 with biden
With so many Left Leaners in this state, it should have already fallen into the ocean...
I noticed a pattern that earthquakes are more frequent when our planet is aligned with gas giants hope that helps l
I better stock up on my california wine
speaking  of  the  1906  san francisco  earthquake  i  heard  there  was    a  luxury  hotel  in  downtown  it  had  just  opened    just  a   few  days  before  the  quake   it  burned  to    the  ground    in  the  fire   caused  by  the  earthquake    im  trying  imagine   the  owner  watching  his  money  go  up  in  flames
Scientists predicted California falling into the ocean in the 80's and way before that too so what's there to worry about?
The death toll still isn't a settled number.   The officials tried to hide the actual number of dead for economic reasons.
What's worse?  San Andreas versus Chile versus off the Northwest coast of America?
**WAVES AT EVERYONE...**  Dutchman sent me... :)
sorry, couldn't get past the reality-show anxiety producing music in the background. Either you're making a horror flick or your making a documentary. Pick one.
Very Informative. Thank You...
Tump about to flip the State, literally.
how absolutely amazing would it be if California just broke off the United States and went its own way! We don't need them anyways LMFAO
Then maybe we'll finally be rid of Kommiefornia, Atlantis style. The wicked shall slip beneath the waves, and be lost forever more.
Please bring this show back so it can be streamed somehwere
with MY luck, it will happen next month when I move out there
People in Hollister watching this 👀🥲  The bridge 😥👁👄👁
I can only hope that California brakes off and floats away with Gaven.
Can you guys start airing this normally instead of reality shows please?
tbh its need to happen..get rid of Commiefornia off the US.
And that’s why I’m not moving to Cali lmfao also too populated
There seems to be much anecdotal reports of animals being agitated prior to earthquakes. There is some guy in California who predicts earthquakes by counting the number of lost dogs listed in the local newspapers Lost Pets section. He has long been debunked by geologists.  It would be interesting to see some real scientific studies done on this.
After that hits be aware of Yellowstone heating up and a mega volcano eruption. Poor joe all this will land on his administration and you can forget about climate change
The earth is flat and domed.
The narrators voice sets the tone.
I've heard this since mid fifties when I was about 10 ... was sure I would never live or visit there... here it is all these yrs later... same msg... it was said Cali would be in the ocean... I have a deep fear of drowning. So, due to long ago circumstances, I 'm living in Tx... just tornadoes there!!!
Interesting
Wonder if one earthquake could lead to a cascade of other earthquakes across the country? I imagine that if it is a possibility it would be a rare occurrence and conditions would have to be just right.
How old is this video. It was made when the History Channel showed history programs instead of pawn shops and custom cars. If that was recent in San Francisco there'd be homeless tents all over.
Bring it already!
The Aleutian Megathrust fault makes the San Andreas look like a child in comparison.
Can you imagine the Loma Prieta quake epicenter being in a populated part of the Bay Area?
Does Vegas take odds on earthquakes? $10 dollars for Thanksgiving Day!
The San Andreas gets all of the attention. Google "America's most dangerous fault" and you'll see that the Hayward Fault is the one to worry about. Anyone who lives in the Bay Area knows that.

2020 says release the kraken
They keep talking about the San a dress fault on the west coast none of them mention the new Madrid fault on the.east of the Mississippi its just as long.
Of course it will happen- it’s the convergence.  It is written.    Even so, hurry Lord Jesus, hurry  🙏✝️🙏
Y u gotta scare me like dat. Is this what i get for being an angeleno
2020- We're in the pot. 2021- On to the frying pan.  Believe that Jesus died and rose on the third day for you. He is coming soon. So many Bible prophecies have been fulfilled this year and others are currently being fulfilled.   What can you lose by believing...? What can you lose by not...?
San andreas fault could erupt anyday now
Wouldn't that be a great day of jubilation. Can't wait to see that sink to the bottom,.
PLEASE- stop that pounding background music & play something less intrusive.  Thank you SO much.
Rocks explode from a lot of heat. Looks to me it's gonna have something to do with Yellowstone, that's a lot of hot for a colliding rock.   Just sayin.
Hmm wonder if there building secret arcs in china
Who remembers the quake of 89’ 👋🏾
Goodbye Mexicalifornia
Odd that there wasn’t a single mention of any of the tens of thousands of drill points or the hundreds of geothermal taps. 🤔
I was in Modesto California 70 miles away from the last earthquake that rocked San Francisco Bay area in 1989 and collapsed the Nimitz Highway. Even being in Modesto it shook that town for well over sixty seconds.
This is predictable, the deep state is gonna set this off some how to create chaos
Honestly, who would miss California?
Fake news
no worries!!! SF and LA people have $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I think they were  already been building huge cities underground and they have those gas llines
his name is "Hugnutz?" really?
There’s an absolutely spectacular, mind blowing 5 part video series produced by a local California TV news station, I put it into a Playlist on my channel. They travel on ground, walking, driving, and flying over the length of the San Andreas Fault.  There’s a winery that’s the Fault LITERALLY RUNS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF. They show half the building shifted about 4 feet in a different direction than the other half, the door frames collapsed.  They show a long distance shot looking down a sidewalk, and there’s a distinct point where the curb and the sidewalk and cement and EVERYTHING shift to the left about 1 foot!  I had no idea the fault line was an ACTUAL line, like something you can literally straddle, one foot on the Pacific Plate, one foot on the North American Plate!  They also show historical photos of a scene with a barn and a tree and a fence lined up about 40 years ago. Then they visit the site today and line up the shot exactly to match the photo - except the nearest half of the fence suddenly is all shifted 3 feet to the North!! The fence changed from a straight line when it was built, into sort of a “Z” shape if you know what I mean.  One of the most fascinating documentaries I’ve ever seen. I’m about to watch this one and see how it compares.
Awesome we don't need California, give it back to Mexico
Let California slide in the ocean...who cares anyways......communist state....oh...and don't  run to Texas  either...
Well maybe something good grows out of commiefornia after
What if they fake a big earthquake with a man made one. That will be great at the moment its perfect long as you not a bottom feeder. Im gone next week at the time im in Los Angeles. ND hear I come
More Fear go figure..
How do you know how old the Earth is you was there?? 🤣🤣 man's arrogance( especially the white/red man whose only been around for 2,000 years if that according to the Bible )..............
Fake news
Will all of California sink in the big one? Or just part of it?
Huh...4.5 billion years...🤔 I thought it was only 4.4 billion years🤨 oh well, that's only 100 million years difference 🤪 close enough🤷‍♂️
that's what happens when you VOTE for the damned Devil, You Nincompoopsters....
Earthquake hits January 20, 2021.
Flying —> using fossil fuels, i.e. destroying the planet Thank u History Channel,  soon ~episode on humanity - extinct from planet earth?
I don't feel any pity for them. They all know they live in a dangerous area, both from below their feet and each other. If they're scared, then move. How about move up here to the upper central plains. All we have are tornadoes, 100+ in summer and -32 in winter and the occasional 3 day blizzard. Nope, let 'em live in the hellhole that is California. I live in God's country.
Good show but narrator cheese!
Glad I dont live there anymore.
this is from 2008 i think. I'm in Gilroy, right near this monster!! It's been WAY WAY too long since we've had a significant  earthquake. The last was over 30 years ago, it's coming, I can feel it. I just hope i'm not trying to use the restroom, or in the shower! LOL Or on a old bridge!
The FAKE HISTORY channel
I think we should wory more on the Juan de fuca - cascadia 700+ miles from Canada to northern CALI could be 9.0+ if full 700 miles ruptured.  Scary.
WHEN?  Maybe In April 2024 when the second total eclipse crosses USA beginning from the Southwest corner traversing up to the Northeast corner to complete the big X over the Nation; that started Aug. 2017 with the total eclipse beginning at the Northwest corner traveling down to the Southeast corner.  And this in conjunction with the Revelations 12 stellar constellation marking the beginning of the judgements upon His House.
So cool.  That's why we live way east of the fault line.  LA will go into the ocean. . . . judging by who lives there, it won't be much of a loss.
welp, 30 years is almost up since the making of the documentary
SAME OLD STORY FOR DECADES NOW AND THIS SHOW IS AN OLD RERUN
Did anyone go out to the ocean from the creek and look at the subduction at that point?
Did anyone go out to the ocean from the creek and look at the subduction at that point?
Just think how many Liberals and fruits this is about to get rid of !!
Well we had a 7 pointer a few years ago so would that have pulled some stress off? Not saying a big earthquake won't happen, we all know something similar happened in Japan on 2011, but we also don't have the extensive major earthquakes they get. So what's the contributions to the differences?
As a lifelong SoCal resident,the thought of this monster embedded into the back of our subconscious,is probably the cause of so much underlying anxiety. Along with the ridiculous costs of living here and always being a paycheck away from being homeless.
When again? ....
Dutchsinse Channel on UTube. Got this figured out .
They have been talking about this for decades just wish it would get it over with and drop California in to the ocean and get rid of some of the fruits and nuts out there🤞👍👍👍
Maybe the next big one in California will let California go into the sea get rid of all the Democrats
Maybe
there is good reason to believe the san andres could be triggered BY the cascadia subduction zone causing up to a 9 magnitude quake along oregon & washington state or visa versa;  potentially that could wipe out large parts of all 3 left coast states.  both fault zones are overdue to go off.
I wish it would and while we are at it, Come on Yellowstone, give us the big 1 already. Mother nature can only heal when humans are gone.
Is this a subliminal message 🥳🥺🙄
No. It should be ok for quite a while. I know it is there, but, it should be ok.
If you think the earth is a spinning ball, you’ve been duped. Not your fault. Research Flat Earth and wake up
Can I share your videos on my YT channel--thanks so much for the info!!!
Well I'm warning you the ocean is going to over spill I reminded you remember
It will plunge the most disgusting of all human scum to have ever existed into the Pacific Ocean.
Interesting timing for this to come on You Tube.
Want NOTHING bad to happen to anyone. However, if it must/will at least all of the people whoever were/are/want to be famous on/in film...will be able to blame all sadness/tragedy on the rest of the country. Like living in New Orleans and spitting venom on the rest of us when they flood and need help...yet again.  They demand to live in a city located below sea level..surrounded by swamp..at the mouth of the largest river on the continent...on a coast famous for violent storms. By, it is always the rest of us who are to blame for not coming up with the billions necessary to rebuild quickly enough to satisfy. So that it can happen yet again...as it always has and always will. At least the survivors will know who to blame..."global warming".
Can’t happen quick enough—please take clear to the East border of Colorado
Feel like I’m in a classroom again after watching this
I wonder if scientists drill bore holes into various sections of the faults along the west coast, and place pressure sensors miles underneath the crust in the bore holes, if perhaps they can predict more closely when earthquakes will occur, how powerful they'll be, and exactly where it'll happen? The more pressure, the more likely a earthquake. It would also give another scale of time, based on how quickly pressure rises within the faults.
Thank god Earth is flat, so don’t fall off when it starts shaking
We sit on tectonic plates that float on lava as the Earth heats up more  chances of earthquake's.
Well 2020 isn't quite over yet...mightbe the only thing missing....the big earthquake. Oh and. NO worries if it does happen Drumpf will do nothing.
1:35 ok
wow. this is painfully simplistic and erroneous in so many facts. Way to go History channel. Propagate inaccuracies.
worst part is? survivors MOVING into other areas of the country.  CA, keep your residents there. we dont want them.
If the threat is cuz the crust is building up pressure then wouldn't it be wise to figure out how to release the pressure in small less devastating increments?
General Funston battled the resulting fires.  Unfortunately his main tool was Dynamite.  This had some bearing on the total number of buildings destroyed.
Yes you can dutchsinse can 👍😎👊
I live on the fault for a few decades now. This is something I shouldn’t have watched...
Maybe we can finally get rid of newsom&pelosi that way...
Mad Max took place in 2021 so there’s that!  🤷
I am 64yrs just waiting for the Big one ??
And they thought it was a great place to build a nuclear reactor. Wonderful!!!!!
YouTube sucks
Educational Programming on the History Channel. Brings back memories of why I got cable to begin with. Welcome Back My Old Friend. Now if you will just give up the aliens, pickers, pawn shops and conspiracy shows. I like my Pickers and Pawn Shops but put them somewhere else.
All this is in the Bible....we got the warnings..oh yeah...we think were smarter than God.
DUTCHSINSE DUTCHSINSE DUTCHSINSE.... who needs the USGS - we dont . DUTCHSINSE
Is there a bunch of Californians that plan a masSive migration to a different location away from the fault?
That's one reason I wouldn't move to california wakeup call for californians. Well i live in warmer weather we to have to worry about hurricanes but that's weather not the earth I'm just saying rude awakening I like to word it under ground volcano maybe one day California be a island take a ferry to it. But until then enjoy the lifestyle..
How can Californians just live with no fear ??
And Americans are still building and living on the fault!!! Insane.
I would never move to California
When the big one hits everyone will be running away. I will run to the fault with all that pressure for so long im sure lots of huge  diamonds will surface as well as tons of gold. In 1971 my mom and dad said after a huge quake I ran in to thier room started jumping up and down yelling do it again  fo it again.
My friend lives 1 mile from the fault in San Bernardino. No big deal.  It is the other faults that get no attention that are the real threat.
Check out Durchsince he has been predicting earthquakes for several years now,  but “ science” and the usgs are not interested in learning about his evidence.   We can all check out Dutchsince on you tube and twitch.  Very interesting.
Dutch sence is the only one who can forecast earthquakes  size by one point on the rector scale and with in 200 miles he is amazing
It will be absolutely horrific when it occurs. The one in 1906 is mild in  Comparison of what’s next.
DUTCHSINCE!!! 🙌🏼❤️🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰
It will happen at night
Maybe  it's  God's way of saying something  about  liberals
In a song by the band named TOOL; The lyrics say "Let em Swim."
lol. that's my brother name Earth!
Hurry up California sucks
Why aren't the scientists figuring out how to slowly let off blasts to loosen the fault slowly and until it is settled?  Then study it again and blast as needed to keep a check on it.
They're trying to tell y'all that it's about to go off
Really.......I believe the Cascadian fault line would be a way worse disaster
Make California Conservative Again...dump LA, San Fran and voila...
I've been living in south California for 31 years and I'm still waiting for the "big one"
Dutchsinse has a wonderful channel on earthquakes, and earthquake forecasting..Much love to Dutch.
Yet, another reason to avoid California...what are the other reasons? Do not get me started..
Me - earth in 2020 couldn't be any more worse  Earth- Hold my beer
Ok,, so the scientists found 'talc' at about 2 miles deep in the (so named San Andreas Fault) and they say that talc is how the earth can slip,,, Oooookk,, so what? How many billions did that little bit of information cost we taxpayers? The scientist says they can now predict when and the shift is now 100 years OVERDUE,, OMG let's wring our hands in depths of despair!! Let's provide a few billion more taxpayer funds to keep this study going 'cause after all, when the scientit SAY HER IT COMES we had better head EAST toward Utah or perhaps Wyoming and we had best do it FAST.   Those of us who think these studies are interesting but not really life threatening, surely not to the extent we want to continue paying for them - lets hold our breath,, shall we.
This explains why California is ran by liberals.... all the shaking has rattled their brains inside their heads.
@18 minutes,, the creek bed takes a right (Northward) travels 300 feet then heads left again,, really.  So,, if we find any place a creekbed turns left then right, then left there' a fault below? Of course not and YES I do know they're saying the SA Fault lies beneath BUT,, c'mon.  Mother Earth moves her planet as she pleases but that doesn't mean we humankind are supposed to be able to predict to what degree or when she will shake herself again.  These scientists use taxpayer funded programs to support their theorys BUT they will NEVER be so smart as to know what Mother Earth knows,, NEVER!
Let's be honest the way 2020 has gone so far it is VERY likely the next "event"
I live near the base of Mt. Rainier and I have only one hope/wish,, when it lets go I hope it takes me and my family with it. I don't want myself, my Wife nor my family to have to deal with the aftermath,, assuming there will be one. BUT, ONLY GOD says when it's our time to go and guess what, I'm good with that. Every now and again Mother Earth lets us know who REALLY IS IN CHARGE on this planet. We humankind need to be reminded every now and then just how insignificant we really are YET how important it is that we take care of our Earth as best we can and NO, I am not buying into the Climate Change being we humankind's fault deal. That is just another ploy to get their hands on we taxpayers cash.
This is nothing wait  till the reset of communism happens America has fallen. Daniel 9 Mathew 24 Revelation 4-20. One way out line it or not. Acts 2:38
They had a 6.9 earthquake in 1989 killing about 67 people and injuring about 3,000 was watching the ball game when it hit it was horrible.
It can't happen too soon. Our Republic needs a cleaning. This is the only way.
History Channel should visit Dutchsinse Channel.  Dutch shows how the energy that causes earthquakes flows like a standing wave. Dropping earthquakes off along the plate boundaries at weak points created by man (drill points), natural weak points(volcanic features), and most recently high tension power lines. Hot spots in California are a huge warning. Tension is building. ...
I would not be surprised.... Having there have been multiple earthquakes on the east Coast.
Be prepared people! Turn to Jesus Christ. Life is short!
Is that why California is trying to ruin the country Interesting
If you live on the fault line, you have only yourself to blame when this happens.
Monday
I'm living on a fault line also.... NC Brevard fault zone
Wow what a bedtime story 😴 😳
“After 300 years science has still made little progress”... until DUTCHSINSE came along! Boom!
I lived in San Francisco but don’t any more.   I use to hear some one say an earth quake may happen in june
If that did actually collapse by the earth quicks one day I bet the people will start having under water cities lol
Taking this as a reminder .. y’all thought this virus was bad this is life changing for the world
In the words of my best friend, also a Central Valley Native, "We use four-pointers to stir our coffee!"
Too many commercials
I don't think angelinoes realize that the the two fault lines are buckling bad and wen it gives way God help them. I'm hoping it won't be as bad as they said and they said it this year I'm afraid for them and they are so used to rocking and a rolling they have no idea how bad it's going to be
Father God bind the powers of Beliel.
The BLM has caused more damage than the earthquakes.
Jesus is  coming any moment now.  Please everyone accept Jesus as your Savior and ask for forgiveness for your sins.  Earth is less than 7000 years old. The earth is flat. The earth is covered with the Firmament.  Space is fake. You can look in the Bible and see the truth.  NASA lied. Governments lied. Dutchsinse is smarter than USGS.
Good maybe all of California will wash into Pacific
“Clues in an old dried up puddle proves that the earth is merely only a marshmallow”
Oh God please let it be true
All these guesses.
Thanks to covid-19 we’re all trapped in our homes
It's not 4.5 billion years old!!!!!!!!!!   And to think I wanted to subscribe and like the channel
Was napping  with the cascadia fault??
I know exactly when the quake will hit...When it's ready and we are not..
All I got to say, is that it's not my fault!
It’s just a matter of time don’t wait for it to happen  get out  while you can !!
If we help Trump steal the election he can blame it on China and make them pay for damages !
Hey hud nut 😂
you guys, Jesus is coming soon!! Please repent of your sins and accept Him as your savior. Reject the world and the lusts of the flesh!! Live your life entirely for God before destruction strikes and judgement is poured out on the earth!! It definitely isn’t easy but it’ll be so rewarding in the end!! Feel free to ask if you have any questions 💞
Has anyone checked The Simpson's if an earthquake is supposed to happen in 2020?
Been waiting 30 years for this I can’t wait 😃.
We need The Rock.....😬😬😬😁
:coronavirus Do I matter to u guys anymore
It'll be fine. The rock will save everyone.
*Good.* Let the cesspit fall into the ocean.
I just noticed this but the picket fence that was "torn in two" along about 5:20ish seems a little "doctored".  Why isn't the fence in the background torn as well? And how did this rickety looking fence break so cleanly apart? It seems like if the ground moved that much, it should have pulled the fence down. There is not a lot of lateral strength in such a fence.
2020 is just a trailer for 2021
Because of all the earth quakes in California is the reason why I won't move to California!!!
Super shear?
Chad Thomson’s Adam and Eve.  Polar shifts
I hope Pelosi's massive estate is ground zero!!!
What scare me is that if it happens while everyone’s in quarantine then that’s a huge no no because people will most likely get  a heads up before hand probably making them rush towards that Airports and this could majorly spike the COVID-19 cases leading to thousands more dying
We know that the earth has a heart beat just like any other functional thing in our world. It has been reported that the beating has gotten quicker... I believe the earth is getting high blood pressure and its about to release a lot of blood(volcanos) & with it many other side effects will occur.
"ALL the evidence" is NOT in. They haven't scratched the surface.
We most likely will never see such a quake in our lifes.
Good
No comment.
This whole video is a lie. Guess people don't even bother to look up facts anymore. You just tell them any dumb lie like this and they believe it. What a shame common sense is almost extinct.
The big one can't happen soon enough!!! CA has become its own third-world country!!!!
horribly just had a dream about this
"Could be up to 2,000 deaths and 50,000 injuries" *Video explains how even the most advanced buildings aren't constructed to withstand these earthquake shockwaves and 4 million people live in Los Angeles*  More like 200,000 deaths and 500,000 injuries in just LA, no telling how big the shock will be and how far it will go. The "big one" is not just a momentary shift of an area of the San Andreas fault line, it's a shift of the entire faultline that would be felt all the way to Colorado and New Mexico.
2 Timothy 3
Um I live right on the line 😬
DEFINE GREATEST FAULT LINE??????? Like... how is it GREAT? And how is another fault line not as GREAT?
I am looking for it to go around December 21st 2020....The great alignment is due then, also the true end date of the Mayan calendar (Not 2012, they messed up the dates by using the gregorian calendar).
How can earthquakes be predictable in one town and unpredictable in the rest of the world?  They don’t recognize the patterns and behavior of data.
THIS. IS. NOT. THE YEAR.
8:56 not sure this is a great place to build house
This is just more proof at how dumb the left wing DEMS are like hey we have this massive fault line that will cause earth quakes so here's an idea let's build skyscrapers
Predictive programming..the movie San Andreas in 2015..Americzn Horror Story Apocalypse and this documentary. This is not a coincidence. Brother and Sisters in California ..please leave.
@13:53 Lizard be like: what y'all human doing in my territory lol
Radio carbon can only be measured up to 4,000 years. The time before that is distorted.
Nice
My thought they seem to miss is this; as the buckling of earth raise as San Andreas fault My that didn't spot the heated area line that cause it. Recreation of a similar action will show the molten substance more likely moved toward the coast. If not also closer to Mississippi Valley areas.  Being said think of it like visioning the raise as plates shift the molten lava must be energy behind this more than explained. So if it's under ground on both sides and the effects are felt toward Hawaii and to Canada then we should look to remainder of activity. Further , lava turns as much as touches to dust or engrained to lava. To differentiate ground matter a study should be done with regular mountains and fault line rise. It might include changes concept as mountains" grow".  The fault seems like it's product of return ing lava after the grand canyon was made. It pushes back and forth like a wave. So the ultimate study can be used for more info.
Only 2020 can make this fault move
Fascinating stuff.  Feeling like a Californian wanting to Head East!!!!  Not sure I want my heritage/lineage to stay in California.
God entered into my body, like a body. my same size. God rips my face, shoots into my mouth, gum disease. JEsus appears and laughs. come to Jesus. he is waiting
2020 Tectonic Plates wants some blood
About 7 or 8 years ago I was woke up in the middle of the night and plainly heard,,,  "San Andreas  12 30"        Idk if it's a date, time, or anything at all, and believe me I prayed about it back then for sure. Never got another clue. Yet obviously California has now set itself apart from the rest of us,,, I mean the US. lol So as they say,,, "only God knows"
Lets hope so and soon.
Nothing would surprise me at this rate. Between covid and conflict everywhere, Yeah, Lets see the Mighty San Andreas fault go Postal!!!!!!!!!!   May God have mercy on all of us..........
Its all San Andreas fault.
Yo ahaha why is this trending ummm
42:11 ⬅️ 99% chance within the next 30 years  Every like equals 42 minutes of time saved  ⬇️
I was expecting this...👀    Just here in California waiting for the Big one to hit
Very informative, maybe soon?
Even after “ the big next earthquake” houses prices will be more expensive in California. Brand new beach at ur doorstep lol.
It's all due to fracking… The more that they do fracking the more earthquakes are going to come
Look at dutchsinse channel he just talked about this
Dutchsense knows. Check out his site.
Well at least we know who’s fault it is!
Definitely have earthquake insurance.

Repeat this prayer from your mouth, and believe it in your heart.  Dear Heavenly Father, i turn to you today, I repent of my sins; I believe that your Son Jesus Christ, died on the cross for my sins, and was resurrected to life on the third day, and forever more he lives. Father, I ask of you to baptize me with the Holy Spirit right now, Change my heart, and renew my spirit. I invite you Jesus, to enter into my heart. change me, Save me, and be Lord of my life. Right now, in your mighty name, I pray, Amen!  Romans 10:9  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
December 2020: Hello there!
News you tube as humans were running out of things to talk about
If you live in Cali, Oregon, Washington, please prepare yourself to evacuate and have plenty of emergency kits! This would be the year for a massive earthquake of the San Andreas fault!
23 min in and they still trying to convince me that San Andreas fault is real...
All based on a theory hahaha Not Fact.History chanel needs to make clear its all based on a lie.Even fosil records show proof of thousands of years not millions ! Get facts before you try to sound like you know you dont!
bruh this is my worst fear....
They are going to use California to bring down the country. Nothing to do with god coming, has to do with harp that’s what the electricity towers are for.
That and the Yellow Stone Super Volcano are too near each other.
Carbon dating has been poven inacurate so why base anything on guessing? Because they want people to belve in evoulution !! Once a lie starts you wack jobs have to keep changing the lie.What a bunch of garbage!!! Stop acting like you know what you do not!!
Honestly i kind of just want it to happen always so we won't need to worry about it for another two hundred years
Dutch always keeps us updated with quakes! He regularly puts out warnings for areas that soon after get hit!
Where's my plane ticket ❓
Imagine this. Build a house split in two. Line the split directly on the fault.  Make the house unbreakable.  Live in the house until the house is no longer a house and then becomes 🎨🖼art🖼🎨
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Our planet isn't billions of years old for one thing and,  earthquakes happen. Scare tactics seem to be the narrative for 2020. "Science" is not required here...but common sense.
Episode Produced in 2009. Scientists predict 99% chance of major earthquake in the next 30 years (from 2009) which brings us to 2040. I get the feeling that this earthquake is just one of many disasters coming our way.
Dutchsinse can predict earthquakes.
I mean people are stupid if they still live their after all thats happenings
Dutchsense
2020 just will not let up 😓
Okay so is Cali and even surrounding states actually ready for this? I live in Hawaii and I’m still scared for you guys.
How about the Cascade fault line? It is supposed to be much larger than the san andreas fault and covers Portland US-Vancouver BC
Especially we only been 8 miles down to the center but we understand everything going on underneath the earth smh
It's a lie there was never one massive content and my proof are the rigges in the ocean they weren't created by a split
I'M ABOUT TO CRY RN IF 2020 DOESN'T GET BETTER I'M 2 YOUNG 2 DIE 😃👍
I remember this video and this isnt new its really old like 10 years old
Dutchsinse sent me. He does videos on earthquake data. Been following the patterns and connections between quakes and can predict areas where earthquakes will happen within a window of 10 days.
I’m screwed I live 3 minutes from the line
I am from Hollister, you can literally see houses that are all wonky along the fault. My sister lives in the areas shown here, her house is maybe......7 houses up from the one with the shifted garden wall
People in cali will watch this and just light one up and go back to the cali life 😂😂.
4.5 billion years old and still evolving,  like everything else, sure it is, not buying it Ill believe God's word over man's anytime  the people at the History channel need to read; Job 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 oh and Genesis  The LORD JEHOVAH IS LORD OVER ALL
Do you not know the earth is flat?  And the deepest anymore has gone into the ground is just over 7 miles and they could not go any deeper.

Hmm let's freak people out.. It is 2020 after all..might as well, eh?

Explosions huh?....  So thats how they trigger them....  how convenient.
Let's hope the promised land stays in one piece. We can't handle any more of their expats leaving for greener pastures.
It's either we got more curious or we ran out of stuffs to watch for a documentary to be on trending page....i bet on the latter.

WE ALL ARE GOING TO DIE OMG
Scary to think it will happen but we've been warned 🤔💭💀
Guess they are warming up the Tesla earthquake machine. Wouldnt Yellowstone be the greatest threat on earth?? Especially since NASA been down there injecting water into the caldera?? Gonna need the History channel to step it up and report on some more real threats. Its also weird how you do not connect these earthquakes with the volcanos lava tunnel system underground and under the ocean floor.. Is the History channel dumbing people down?? These fools think they know something fro mcracks in the dirt??? FOH with these guesses and assumptions
I really wish they wouldn't do this to people. I have lived in California all 55 years of my life. Specifically in Ridgecrest where in 2019 we experienced two moderate earthquakes in two days; a 6.4 and a 7.1. Throughout my life I have seen several earthquakes of significant magnitude.   While they say we are long overdue for an event on the San Andreas, they always leave out the part where there were periods of a thousand or more years between events. In other words, it isnt worth losing sleep over. There are much bigger things to worry about.   I have come to notice the majority of earthquakes are localized events; Ridgecrest 2019, Northridge 1994, Landers 1992, Coalinga 1983; I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Prepare for those types of earthquakes. Yes, they can be damaging but recovery is easier. I have also come to realize nothing brings a community together like an earthquake. Be good to your neighbors, that is the best way to prepare for an earthquake. You may need them after one. While waiting for federal assistance, your neighbors will come together much quicker.  This is a good educational video on the San Andreas, but nothing to be alarmed over
Hopefully soon California deserves it.

I believe the fault lines were caused by the water braking through the earth when God flooded the earth in the days of Noah’s arc 🤔 , also I don’t believe the planet is as old as scientists believe it is. Jesus will be back soon repent and be saved 🙇🏻‍♀️🙏🏻 give your life to Christ
2020: yo san andreas be looking fire
I wish California would hurry up in fall in.... USA would be better
Maybe this would knock some sense into fantasy land.
I really hope it ruptures soon!
i remember watching this documentary in middle school and i’m in college now which means ‘30’ years is probably like 20 now
Please do.
2020 still has a month left.
People that live near Oceans, Volcanoes, Fault Lines, Hurricanes, and enemy Missile strikes so close they'd have no warning.....so obvious they never paid attention in school.  I will never donate money to any of those causes lol.
You know, when I see videos like this on YouTube’s trending list.. it really makes me wonder what’s going on with the YT algorithm. Another example: does anyone remember/or was anyone on YouTube on New Year’s Eve/New Years day at the start of the year? YouTube’s algorithm was recommending a movie called “The Bridge” to thousands of users. If you’re not aware, the whole movie is about suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge. The movie is old, and came out in the mid 00s. But on what could be a very tough and sad day for many people (New years eve and other holidays can be tough for those who are alone or those dealing with depression), YouTube was recommending a movie, to thousands of people, that profiled people who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. The comments were full of people who were all saying the same thing - “why is this being recommended to me on New Year’s Eve?”. Most of whom spent the night alone.  There were even comments from people actually contemplating suicide! It was eerie. The next day.. the video was gone. Completely taken off YouTube entirely. Not only that.. but who would have known that 2020 would become one of the toughest years for most people, and that suicide rates would rise in response.  Now here we are at the end of 2020, and YouTube has this on it’s trending list?? Another old show talking about doom and gloom.  Sometimes make you think, how much of this can be a coincidence?
Great to know i sleep in my bed which is less than 10 miles away from fault line :):)
Only people who live in California and are near the fault are watching this
The town that I live in, we’re all bound to be dead when “the big one” occurs, so we all are all just in a mutual agreement that that would be the end and that’s that 😂😂
Santa Clarita will be an island.
Mother Earth is purging and she is on overdrive.
The major earthquake building up won’t happen until the tribulation.
2020: *Bang* - *Bang* - *Bang* Merry Christmas
I’ll just watch this before I go to bed thx
Dutchsince Forecast Earthquakes, why doesn't our Government Dept. USGS?
Spoiler for the end of 2020
San Andreas earth quake is going to be the next 2020 update
History Channel trending? Nice 👌.
Cant wait for 2021 already.... If we even get to see it at this point lol.....m
Finally something that is actually worthy of trending on YouTube
Ugh I love so close to San Andreas!’ Now im scared again 🤨😭😭😭😭😭😭
😣
Am I safe in Los angels area? Or should I move?
Guys if this aired in 2009 and they said in the next 30 years the earthquake will happen that would be 2039. That would only be 19 years from now
As a Californian, this is terrifyingly interesting
If a big one were to happen in LA or near LA will be 6.0 - 9.0 forsure !!  It'll affect everyone in southern California forsure! 11/22/2020  have an earthquake plan, be prepared and stay safe don't be scared
If it’s so dangerous why the heck did we build entire cities on it
I hope this doesn't cause more liberals to move to TX lol
Oh thanks I wanted to know
Where’s the water in the creek? Diverted to LA?
who else can’t wait for the 2020 finale, this and yellowstone volcano watch
Please no more liberal California.
Commiefornia drifting away wouldn’t hurt my feelings.
You pronounced marin wrong
This my biggest problem with the current administration... I’m in the Bay Area where science really matters
When the San Andreas Fault finally Causes a huge and powerful earthquake, the state of California is most likely going to be destroyed, both physically and economically.
Me: A Californian relaxing in bed.  History Channel: PERIL
Why is a 8 year old episode in trending?
Everyone in California acknowledges that it’ll happen at some point, we just sorta live our lives with the hope that it doesn’t happen while we’re showering
EARTH.                                                             There it is. 🌎
ah yes exactly what we need to end this wonderful year
As a Californian, I hope the earthquake happens and California falls into the ocean
POV: You clicked on something interesting at 1:00am before going to bed
End 2020 with a literal boom
This warning is for 2020
Why you gotta scare the weak minded by the masses. Lame
Meh, California needs to go anyway
200 billion in damages...  is that in 2015 money? I would estimate it to be triple that in 30 years time.
2020 ofc
This is such an old episode
California falling off dosen't sound to bad. But then you realize the survivors woud have to move somewhere else to destroy.
Guys this was released in 2009 (from what I see in the comments)
That would be awesome if CA was no longer connected to the rest of the US...  Take Oregon & Washington too. LOL
Not sure WHY this is trending...but someone needs to get ahold of Dwayne The Rock Johnson ASAP.
Hutt nut
Interesting although I think the documentary is exaggerating how novel a lot of the information presented is.  Edit: made in 2009. Point still stands but less so
Keep prayers up.
Earths crust: it’s time to show some love let’s come together   “Cause havoc and small human’s buildings get destroyed” Humans: 😲😡
Not everyday a History channel documentary is top trending
The weight of the homeless population in California is pulling the earth crust apart.
Why is this Trending ?
Always believe in god ✨
Thanks to the camera man for traveling at the speed of light to witness what was happening
So ocean front property in Arizona?
I'm glad Trump exposed this and put a stop it.  MORE TRUTH NEEDS TO COME OUT.  Tectonics = fake news.  Evolution = fake news.  Tsunamis fake.  Radiation lasting 1000 years = fake news.  MAGMA UNDER yellowstone = fake.  Dinosaurs... really dragons that the lord made in the devils likeness like Hilary
Nowhere near as bad as the 3 faults that collide in the Indian ocean.
Why is this trending??? Did I miss some tragedy again?
cool
Uhm Hollister has HAD earthquakes and massive ones at that
TRUMP WILL BUILD NEW WALL TO STOP THE EARTHQUAKE.
Me in California: Well 2020 you finally got me GG
Watch Dutchsinse..
Never seen someone so excited about a rock before.
wow that was intense
Everyone: "2020 is almost over!" 2020: "You haven't even seen my TRUE form!"
I went straight to the end of the video to skip all the garbage mumbo jumbo.
So mostly the people by the shore will be screwed?
I watched this last year in science class.
San Andreas fault runs right through our backyard so living on top of the fault line I’m good lol 😂
Glaciers are growing? 🤔 0:15
youtube making me paranoid putting this on trending
Maby after this Yellowstone will explode
What year was this made?
Couldn't happen soon enough. I mean, oh no that would be tragic Hope it never happens.
yo don't scare me i live in cali
Na we dont need to worry about the Fault, its Cali, they will just riot against the fault to stop it from shaking and demand we tax the earth hahaha
God made everything.
I can't wait.
watches from la
This would be the cherry on top the cake for 2020  Edit: 2021 anyone?
2021 the big one going to hit be ready
Wait. This video isn't about GTA at all.
Well congrats to History Channel for making it on trending.
In a few million years all of land on earth will combine into one making a super continent
They need to make more seasons. I miss “How the Earth was Made”. This series inspired me to become a Geologist.
Stop giving 2020 ideas!!!
I hope they watched the movie.
Let’s see if 2020 will send them off with a boom!! There goes those 55 electoral votes!! What will the pansies do then?!!
I’m staying in the East Coast.
It’s just California
Theirs room.
So is this Trump's fault too or Bush's?
Hollister was the epicenter for the earthquake that happened as the world series in the bay area back in 1990 or 89, was about to start. Forgot the year, but even from Stockton it was so strong!
Ah yes 1 of few perks of living all the way in Michigan....far ish away from there 😅
Isn’t it a known fact that carbon-14 dating has been shown to be inaccurate?
"Hey uh whats next on the list for 2020" God: "Yes"
Finally something sensible is trending
We need to make evey effort to pinpoint this down to the day. Then hold a major Democratic convention on that day as well as making sure the heads of Google Facebook Amazon attendance is mandatory. Juan Williams and Jim Acosta can be invited to host it. Make it the biggest liberal event in Los Angeles history!
We can only hope.
So basically the Mayans got the date wrong 2012=2021 they got the last numbers wrong
Maybe 2021 or maybe 2022
Geez this would make 2020 worst or 2021 if
This was filmed like 10 years ago, so it’s anytime now. It is believed to be now until March 2021
I don’t know how old this is, but San Andreas is not the biggest threat to the pacific west coast. This whole thing is poorly researched.
I wouldnt mind if California would just drift away
God's judgment on rebellious and evil california. Get offended
Will this be the final chapter of 2020?! Find out next time in dbz!
CNN IS RENAMING IT TO  TRUMPS FAULT.
it would be so grate to see the whole state and people there slide off in to the ocean and die!
But seriously, who cares!?!
Everyone:  2020 nightmare  is almost over.    2020:   And for my grand Finale
So now all of us has to watch that movie again?
As a person who lives about an hour away from San Andreas Fault (Southern Cali near Salton Sea) I'm lowkey terrified after watching this video
Please everyone, trust in Jesus as Your savior. If you don't think he's real, ask him to reveal himself to you and he will. He loves you and he's waiting for you. He's very real. He loves you.
"America's geologists, her rock detectives" Lmao
100 million years ago ?? 🤔.  20 million years ago 🤔🤪. Wow.  So smart 😤
Ok
December 14 get ready if you live on the east near LA
Good program..but filmed in 2009. Things have changed in the last 11 years
i saw this like a decade ago, why is this here now? lol i watched this in school
They're trying to tell us something
So dig down there and carry out a fracking operation.  It’s been shown in Oklahoma and other places where fracking is performed that it causes many small earthquakes, 2.5 to 3.0.   Better to have many small quakes than one big one.
To: Los Angeles major Eric Garcetti and Councilman district 13 MItch O’Farrell. With all this evidence, how can you approve the construction of the Hollywood Center and the building on Yucca and Argyle Ave? You’ll be remembered by the deaths of those who WILL die when those buildings WILL certainly fall down. YOU are for certain accountable.
I'm guessing December 11th, what do y'all think?
This? Trending?! Bruh
Anybody can see the sheer wave is caused by the explosion impact!  Jeez I guess anything for that grant money...
I hope it DUMPS THE WHOLE  West Coast COAST INTO The Ocean
Plates moved 4500 years ago and all will move again in 2028.
All 3 faults, The San Andreas, Cascadia and the Hayward faults all connect at ends. If you research carefully you will see them.
Everyone keeps talking about 7.0- 7.8 quakes on the San Andreas. I believe at least a 8.2 or greater will hit the San Andreas. Then we have the Hayward Fault which is another dangerous fault then the other Big one the Ticking Ticking time bomb the Cascadia which will hit above a 9.2 at least, maybe even greater.
I've been hearing about it for so long I'm just ready to get it over with.
dutch was in rare form with the comedy today!
Ladies and gents behold the grand finale of 2020.
Thank God for Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
You can post videos like this in 2020... anxiety!
Glad i dont live there
HOW THE EARTH WAS MADE: 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was without form, and void; and darkness [a]was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.  3 Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. [b]So the evening and the morning were the first day.  6 Then God said, “Let there be a [c]firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.  9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
11:55 PM on December 31st 2020: And now... my magnum opus.
Satan loves destruction so he has souls to steal of those not born again in Christ and not repented and died. Jesus Saves!
Just a friendly reminder that if you skip to the end of the video and replay it, the ads get removed
They didn't mention the Los Angeles earthquake of 1994
I can’t wait!
Ya know what I find absurd?. People as a whole are dumb. I mean , who in their right mind, would build their house on top of a bee hive . And then do it again when I bites and stings us to death. And still they stay even tho they know it will kill them again. Obsurd.
Californians need to go💀
It only runs it's path  3 miles away from where I live now. I lived thru the Sylmar and the Northridge quake. + many other ones.  We just a 5.0 Jolt about a month ago.
Oh bou
Can’t wait for it.
Yep, us Californians are sitting ducks, but it's not just California, when the big one hits it'll be strike like a dominal effect, there are so many fault lines connected like the ring of fire, all around the world, Crazy right??
Will the big one hit in December? I was thinking alien contact, but this is more likely

The destruction of California would hardly be a disaster.
Please read the BOOK OF REVELATION
Bye 👋 bye Cali, we'll miss you
it’s about time
The San Andrea's fault causing a horrible earthquake and destroying California; or even better, splitting it off the continental US, would be the best thing to ever happen for this country. I look forward to that day
So why build there?
Haha.... HUDNUT.....
WATCH DUTCHSENSE!!!!  He's been forecasting for years!!!! It is totally possible!!!
Why is this trending...lmao
Sounds too good to be true. Who really needs California anyway
🍕🍕🍕🍕 distraction
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them✌️
🍕🍕🍕🍕
There are some faults but it’s still the best GTA imo despite this review
Lies lies lies
I heard in 2022 the san andreas fault line will rumble but I could be wrong.  Theres also the  Madrid fault line which is just as bad, maybe worse but its in the Midwest
Why is this trending? XD
My boyfriend and I went on vacation last summer. We made a big loop which went as far northwest as Yellowstone, down through Colorado, to Arizona to see the Grand Canyon then worked our way back home to Missouri just outside of St Louis. I'd gone to all these places as well kid with my parents. I've traveled to Colorado alot since my brother, nieces and nephews live there. This time, though we experienced a bizarre phenomenon on ALL THE HIGHWAYS starting when heading southeast from Yellowstone. Colorado and Arizona  were the worst. There were these sudden sharp creases in the pavement--where the Highway bulged upward creating a ramp. It sent our 3/4 ton pickup and 40 foot travel trailer airborne. These "ramps" occurred repeatedly. They were a mile apart or so on average. Even when we slowed  down below the speed limit we still went airborne. This happened so many times it broke our exhaust system lose 3 times!!! When we asked about the roads, we were told by people that it was due to geological activity. This was NOT THE WAY THE ROADS WERE WHEN I WAS YOUNG. So something IS going on. It may be hundreds of years before something significant occurs since the geologic process is slow compared to the way humanity keeps time. But who knows? Could be sooner than we think. Just saying.
Earthquake will be infected with covid
fault line / gov.  which first?
God lets hope so
As I’m in my bed right above it. 🙄
I wouldn't mind a few ads but 38m 19s of unskippable ads was way too much.
GTA SA?
Fear mongering at its finest eh? I live in California all my life and in my experience this conversation has always been used to rile everyone up.  I have seen everywhere else beset by natural disasters why should I be special? Bring it on but I refuse to live in fear
cool
Man I hope we lose California, along with all the lefty pedophiles
What your hands look like underneath a public bathroom hand dryer at age 47
Jesus loves you.
Idiot driver of that year goes to the cop at 24:22 🤡
A very bad use of Saint Andreas's name.  How about changing it to Iskariots Fault.  Death and destruction relate better to Iskariot's name and behavior. Right?
Bring it on already
Intro   *Earth, a 4.5 billion year old planet, still evolving*  -Creationist has left the chat-
as if liberals, high taxes, high prices, hollywood and Nancy Pelosi were not enough disasters, now we have this thing coming. welcome to california
If the "big one" finally hits, how far will it be felt? Example, will people in New York feel the effects or what will happen in places not places not California?
Carbon dating has been proven inaccurate many times over.
Built a new house...but unfortunately lied along the fault line..😂😂😂
I'd like to see undeniable evidence of these millions of years they keep talking about. They can not prove millions of years. They can only guess and believe. By believing, it makes it a religion.
I think I've heard that were due for a historical event on the san andreas fault for my entire life.
Have a great day and check out my Northwoods Peach Tree YouTube channel
You have to live like this, if it happens it happens. it's mother nature . Humans will always persevere
I just watched san Andreas fault line last night and thought what if.... and here it is
We have been warned about this for decades. To live in these area's is insane. If you live in these type of area's move or you may face this horror.
RE:  The whole thing about there not being records in North America before the European explorers came here.  Uh, yes there are records.  The have been humans living here for thousands of years. Their records might no be "written" but, they are told in stories.  Sometimes in glyphs, sometimes in knots.  History channel sucks so bad.
If you are reading this, stay strong, healthy, safe, and don't lose hope. We will overcome 2020's adversities soon with kindness, resilience and resistance. During these dark times there is always hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news: God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free. In these uncertain times, cast all your burdens on Jesus; for he cares for you. If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a way maker If you need freedom or saving He's a prison-shaking Savior If you've got chains He's a chain breaker. Its never too late in this life to put your trust in him. Don't let your heart be troubled in these times.  I wish you the best day.
I live in San Diego so I’m terrified
Why does it look like this was filmed in 2006
What they mean about to strike Fr???
Goodbye Sanfranpsycho, Lost Angeles. Totally polluting the Pacific.
Well at least it’s right through California,  the trash of the country
2019 - 2020 covid 19 2021-2022 helping us after cali falls into the ocean lmfao
This is the second most California danger next to Democrats.
We don’t need em
Watching this makes me  happy I live in ny
Bad news for CJ and grove street 🍀
I think humans are just too impatient, the San Andreas fault will take many more thousands of years to move California to Alaska. Large earthquakes are going to happen but knowing this it’s stupid that we fail to reconcile this and accept the consequences of our choices.
The one thing southern Californian's may not be aware of is out by Palm Springs there are two major transportation corridors located in that area,  Interstate 10, and the Union Pacific Yuma Subdivision. Both carry transportation in and out of that region. The Union Pacific Yuma Subdivision is along a rail corridor called the Sunset Route. Amtrak's Sunset Limited and the Texas Eagle runs that subdivision into West Colton Yard in Colton CA.   Northwest of there lies the San Bernardino Mountains that sits on the North American Plate, and the San Gabriel Mountains that sits on the Pacific Plate. Between the two mountain ranges sits Cajon Pass. This is where a part of the San Andreas Fault . In this pass sits Interstate 15, Historic Route 66, the BNSF Southern Transcon, and the Union Pacific Mojave Subdivision. The importance of this pass cannot be calculated. The BNSF Southern Transcon and where it runs through the pass is called the Cajon Subdivision. Amtrak's Southwest Chief runs this subdivision. The BNSF Southern Transcon runs from Chicago to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, and is responsible for about 25 to 30% of the country's rail freight. The transcon runs through the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico,  Arizona, and California respectively.   I-15 which is a major trucking and automotive transportation corridor that connects with I-40 in Barstow, I-80 in Salt Lake City, and I-90 in Butte Montana. Northwest of the Cajon Pass lies Interstate 5 near Gorman. The fault slices through that area as well. I-5 begins on the US/Canadian border north of Blaine Washington, and ends at the US/Mexican border south of San Diego. This too is an important corridor. This connects  I-90 in Seattle, I-84 in Portland Oregon, I-80 in Sacramento, I-10 in Los Angeles, I-15 in San Diego.
See Dutchsinse on YouTube or Twitch for excellent forecast predictions based on the Dutch model.
its ok the democrats can handle it....let calif fall in the ocean
*I want to know why I'm getting notices for this video when I'm not subscribed?*
the only people that will ever die is someone who had goodness to give, which will be very few, and no I dont mean You...................................................................
YOU THROW EVERYTHING OFF WHEN  YOU USE THE WORD MILLION YEARS. THE EART IS NOT THAT OLD!   😱
Cascade is the ONE to Warn of. Witch would likely set off San Andres.
This is a older episode. It originally aired in 2009. So much has changed since then, geologically and seismically speaking. If it is something your truly curious about you will need more current and up to date facts.
people have been singing the same exact song for.....DECADES ...LIFETIMES...
I hope that it hurries up
just look for the drunk walking straight
I for one won't be sad when Cali breaks off and floats away to China...Take Gavin and Nancy far far away      in any event....interesting doc
Isnt it overdue to happen?
The geologist- Charlie Paul, I believe- standing on the andreas fault seemed absolutely giddy! I love it- how adorable!😋🌍🌁
Funny earthquakes can be late like a woman's period. Menstrual cycles also have a typical regularity but can be early or late and a lot of times that's due to things like what she eats and stress levels so basically her health. N coincidentally earth is considered a feminine energy ("mother earth") so me wonders if the earth's health relates with the regularity of her cycles. N me wonders also if the slowing down of cycles relates to that of menopause which is preludes the end of life stage.
100 million years?! Umm according to the bible the earth is only 7000yrs old!!
Hopefully that fault line breaks and californicate crashes into the ocean (Catalina) but before any of those left wing socialist in that state escape. They get to be their own country OR, become part of Mexico. Probably enough monies in that state just buy Mexico then you got your cheap labor
Check out mud Fossils University
God is sending us warning after warning   Not many care  to listen   Jesus help us
There's a contradiction in the visual illustrations of this video. First subduction is illustrated, Then no subduction is illustrated. When the scientists can make up their mind let me know.
If that fence moved @5:50 why would the grass not tear and just spread out like that its like it just made grass grow in a good 3-4 foot space
wish that quake would happen ASAP
Hopefully there will be a big enough earthquake to detach California from america
History channel= covid=pandemics=Cabal you will fall
They chose to live there and stay.  I have been in earthquakes measuring 1.9 to 7.6 in 4 different states, as well as flood, fire, tornado and hurricane, and I am still going.
Just give it back to Mexico..
Great, all we need is more Californians moving east.
Earth is flat.
Great video lots of interesting informative
Its like waiting for Christmas morning. I can not stand the wait. Let the population control event slide California into the ocean. Let the world finally be rid of hippie tree hugging Hollywood trash. Long live Slayer and Cartman.   (Seriously though, if you choose to stay and live near earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, volcanos etc... I have no sympathy.)  Survival of the fittest.
@Whoop!
Predictive programming at its finest.
The thing to stop this castrophe  is to find out where and when it will happen and then get every politician in California to stand on that spot.
I may not be able to purchase that new ps5 in time
2020 still has another month left....
The Left Coast is already a separate country. The sooner it physically breaks off, the better off America will be.
ANNOYING BEYOND PATIENCE is the fact that every History Channel's "How The Earth..." show excessively recaps after *EVERY* commercial break, so by show's end it's not just like you're watching a rerun~ but spent nearly an hour to view non-repetitive info that's but a few minutes in length... FIRE THE EDITOR.
As a offworlder, this is good planet information
And I live right on top of it. Solano County
All that I was needing was love and help my poor my homeless they don't wanna help us arrdan en el infierno
I'm dying don't let me go 😭 I love poor people I've been saying it
I don't want to do anything but you are hurting me I can't no more
2020 hasn't been exciting enough already. Time to really shake things up. If u get my rift, I mean drift.
This video may have been released nine months ago but this video looks like about 30 years old that’s why I gave you a thumbs down
not me watching this at 4am at home, which is practically on the san andreas fault...
Sad thing is it is NOT the worse fault line. The fault north of this runs all the way through Seattle WA and into Canada then Alaska. It is the real killer fault line that will cause tsunami and millions of deaths especially in areas like Seattle. Look it up in the National geology records.
Seriously History Channel
Theory,  means not proven,  just a satanic lie.   Tectonic plates LOL
20 million years ahead? bruh california be long gone before that time even cross a 100 years, thank the democrats no earth quakes needed!
Was taught mississippi river flows in longest north american fault .
Parts of muscle rock our giant ancient creature watch this video it even shows the angles where you can see the creature mudfossil university covers all this stop lying history channel tell the truth about what the earth is made of it’s not tectonic plates in lava🤣
joe biden  will save us no need to panic he is fresh in the head young in the body no need to panic
bye bye California. the best thing that could happen to America!
Did anyone else just feel that ? I feel fantom earthworms all the time
😁✌🖖👌👍😎
Even out the hippies
We already know that explosives have been strategically placed deep down in the fault line. It's just a matter of when they feel they need to push the button..... Want to leave Cali??? That's probably a good idea!!! Better Get to Gettin' while the Gettin's Good......
Is this an old video? Was it just released today?
That’s so ridiculous to think the land fits like a puzzle and can move together or apart. Don’t you realize there is land under the water as well. The continents are not floating on the water.
I couldn’t live in CA, I’ll be too paranoid.
I’m in Oakland and looking at this and at 2 am 😭💀 now I won’t be able to sleep
Prediction: there will be a run on toilet paper❗️
Shake liberal control off CA
"They" put "In God We Trust" on all of the money, but continue to perpetuate that Earth is 4.5 billion years old. What ever happened to the truth instead of theoretical ideas and "we think" this happened or "we think" that happened...
4:35 That looks kinda like Jamie Hyneman or at least a relative.
WATCH DUTCHSINSE!!!! 'EXPERTS " KNOW NOTHING
Atleast they warned us various times before it happens.
Tesla referenced human energy 🌪👻jesus christ referenced living waters 💎🤍science described water memory 🌊👨‍🎓existence reflecting psychologically psalms16:24 k,j 👻💎🤍👨‍🎓💖🗽🌪🌪🌪
Me at 12am, this looks like a job for watch later
Being from Texas, I can't even begin to imagine the ground moving under my feet. Such a traumatic experience 😮😯😐😔
They've been saying the big one is coming for as long as I've been alive. They'll be an eruption of a volcano in the lower 48 before the big one hits.
A 7.8 would be nothing when the cascading subduction finally consumes the Juan DeFuco tectonic plate and releasing the Pacific plate margin just west of Oregon the imparted stress to the North  American l plate will cause the second lock point just north of Los Angeles. To finally crumble . This will probably then record an earthquake of 10+.
what if the so called San Andreas fault is asvtyually a cover for underground nuclear testing. just a crazy thought I had.
If you think this is the catastrophe that'll "rock your world", wait till you see the pole shift that's coming.
It's not San Andreas fault tho
Don’t look here(Cascadia) LOOK HERE (San Andreas) Cascadia is the doozy we need to be keeping our eye on.
Two words: New Madrid 👀  If you don’t know about it, and you live in the Midwest, or on the East Coast of the United States, you better look it up.
Watch Dutchsense, he's been predicting earthquakes for a Decade...They still dismiss him but you can't when he calls them withing 10days for a decade...🤣
My home is about 2 miles from the southern section of the San andreas fault.  I was born here. I'm 61 now and have heard this all my life. Hasnt happened.  May happen tomorrow,  or maybe a 100 years from now. NOBODY KNOWS WHEN.  I do not worry about it.
Still boggles the mind how Creationists can justify this.
No vax.  Do not fear.  Have FAITH in Jesus Christ!
It's 2020, this would not surprise me at all.
no it's not about to strike...  but thanks....
NERDS!
This was an exceptionally good documentary.  It was like a great sci  fi piece—terrifying and wonderfully informative at the same time.  I don’t mean I don’t take it seriously, and I’m not moving to San Francisco or Los Angeles any time soon.  It was just really dramatic in ways that made the science easy to grasp.
Well, that will shake a lot of people out of their fake realities, literally.
My Goodness That Is The Biggest Line Of Crack I’ve Ever Seen...
Oh great, just what we needed, another reason for more loony Californians to flee the pen and spread their ilk around.
A 4.5 billion years... No one was there  perhaps we'll no one , If bad images are documented it's not coincidence... Perhaps there's another entity.
History channel is entertaining
Hint.............Hint  Covid-19: Welcome to 2020!!!  San Andreas Fault: Hold my Mocha Latte!!!
The big one is been coming since before we were born, california's heavy traffic is the reason for its delay.
a geology professor I had said, California, great place to visit, but not to live. Also what about the asbestos releases when that fault has activity?  Mainly Serpentine.
I grew up in Los Angeles & this fault has been waiting to break for 50 years or more...
5:20 is where the documentary is wrong. The “background” fence should have moved as well not just this piece of fence.
A scientific report of a disastrous earthquake needs a code name.  Ok............
I know its coming. All I hope is that im with my daughter and wife when it happens.
Hopefully the whole Coast just breaks off and sinks into the ocean. Bye San Francisco, Bye Nancy, good ridence Waters, Bye you P. O.Schiff. Not really. I'd miss Nancy. I don't want to forget what Skeletor and Tales of the Crypt looked like.
For stealing mexico
23:07 Bridge Railing have started to bend. 23:12 Man walks on bridge where railing is starting to bend. NOPE!
The gloom and doom channel .
This is all we need to end 2020 with
The firemen have been working hard enough already.
Why was this released today? Is YT trying to tell us something?
Fake News 👱🏼‍♂️👎
thank god I live in florida
From my observations of things most don't see and/or know about is thunderstorms can be the trigger as they create huge explosions over head in the clouds that can and do shake the very ground we walk on. Most simply do not know that thunderstorms produce vast amounts of hydrogen and oxygen at or near the bottom of the cloud which is ignited near the top of the cloud. So, the next time California has a massive thunderstorm that covers a large part of the state is when the big one is more than likely to hit.
I don't need to see this I already saw a 1:54:00 documentary with Dwayne The Rock Johnson
Anybody got toilet paper coz i cant find in Wal-Mart ....
It better not happen while I live here.
I hope it does happen, get rid of California
It's a shame it doesnt run the entire border of California. I dont think anybody would miss it if it ALL slipped off into the Pacific
🤨🤔🙏🏃‍♂️
I’m sorry but I do not believe all that is said in this video are true. I truly believe our earth is young like around 7 thousand years old. It makes more sense. “Is genesis history” and I truly believe it is and science back it up
I miss the earthquakes of California. But, I am enjoying the hurricanes and tornadoes of Florida now!
Welp, time to double check the stockpile and go bags y’all. Stay safe
"Arizona Bay"
I live like 15 mins away from it lol
I live  20 minutes away from San andreas fault , Adelanto CA high  desert .😱
New evidence suggest that if we stitched all the money we wasted researching it in to binders stretched across it the quake would be impossible
I’m over here trippin my face off... finding it funny dudes are geeked over rocks while I’m geeked on shrooms to each their own
The 🌎 is growling
Embellish much? "One of the most dangerous geological features on earth"... What is their metric for danger here?
lies! remember the Bible is the word of God and it isnt 4 billion years old.
Calm down u cant ever predict when thats gonna go so idk y the thumbnail said its gonna strike
Wouldn't be a huge loss for the world..
You're obviously not from Marin County. Do you know why I say this?
Need to move that line 50 miles east....then drive a chisel down it
Eh I’m ready for the next life anyways lol
I hope sumthin happens
Welp, guess I'll just die
California's real estate market just died;   30yr mortgage?... no thanks... I'll pass!
All we can do is pray for Lex Luther. C'mon Man.
Dude imagine that earthquakes are nothing more than growth pains. I say this with the thought of the fence moving away from where it was, I am wondering if anyone has ever thought to see if the planet has grown at all.
yOU KNOW THE SHOW SUCKS BAD WHEN IT REPEATS ITSELF AFTER AN ADVERTISEMENT. STUPID AF
You all have no Authority how to say how old the Earth is
6.4 in chili.  The big one is coming straight up,,to california from chili
The human population is in a far much larger danger then the fault line and possible earth quakes by it's governing officials.
Interesting..lived Southern Calif. from 1983 to 2012. I get it..lol. Thankyou & the saying is :  "It's not my fault, if Cali falls into the Ocean..... it's the San Andreas."
I will be watching this faultlines career with grate interest
Release Date: 10 February 2009
Yes, earths mysteries r so much larger than life 🙀
🎼California Love!🔥🔥🔣🔄🌅r.i.p.Tupac, Eazy E, Toker & Nipsey
Air date was February 10th, 2009... So... another 20years?
Hopefully it takes Oregon and Washington along with California.
We can only pray. Cali needs to end up in the ocean
yikes
We are so screwed, what a time to be alive
San Andreas was very interesting I liked this one
For those watching this in fear because you live in the fault..... I can sell you a home in Arizona come on by
God word is everlasting
I beg your pardon Mother Nature ?
I worked oil exploration in the California valley in the mountains very close to where the helicopter video was taken  I found huge boulder size deposits that were mostly sea shells 100 miles from the ocean high up in the mountains
the quake will come but forgive me if I saw a documentary 30 years ago wherein the top geologist in CA said their was about a 100% chance that there would be the big one in anonther thirty years ... that would be now when the top geologists still have the same time line ... 100% in thirty years ... or tomorrow ...
Listen to this degenerate narrating this saying the Earth is for Point yada yada yada like he knows they have no clue of anything they say everything is made up fantasy just like the fake media. It's all bulshit
No big loss. California is a cesspool.  When it hits, I hope Pelosi is at home eating her ice cream.
I’ve been in Alaska many years and the last 3-4 years have been more active since I have been here. The Pacific plate is moving north and that allows the San Andreas Fault to move north.
Peace to all
50th comment
This is all false
The San Andreas is not the greatest fault line in the world
I was in the 6th grade in san jose California when the 1989 quake hit. I had after school detention and thats why I was getting off the late BART train downtown when it struck. The whole town was getting ready to watch "the battle of the bay" . SF giants were playing the Oakland As in the World Series that year. That was 1 of the craziest moment of my life . In seconds everything was damaged or destroyed there downtown.
Let's go San Andreas, finish 2020 with a bang
2020 doesn't have the balls
Hut Nut...lol
They want out.... This is their chance. Our manufactued 2020 is actually 2012 !
Thanks history Channel! Cable is dying but u are not!
When the Big One happens, I'll be at the bar instead of stuck in traffic without a beer.
Anyone else feel History is between the lines telling us what's about to happen via YT drops
Stop the steal!
COOL! Then we won’t have to worry about Global Warming!
How resilient is the Golden Gate Bridge to a potential earthquake?
I’ve been in Alaska many years and the last 3-4 years have been more active since I have been here. The Pacific plate is moving north and that allows the San Andreas Fault to move north.
Put 🙏
🙏
Mud floods and liquatifaction , also set off by our evil controllers, destroying GOD'S creation and His people
When it hits California will never be able to rebuild due to current regulations.
And yet to buy a home in that area has $500,000 or more
Ello guys
Earth quakes are dynamite planted by the evil controllers of this planet
Thank you💕you take care to💕✌️✌️
I know only 1% of people are going to see this if you do see this then like so I can know how many people saw this  👇
I got here fast because of the title
Passed the bridge to nowhere you should be good
Whose fault is it?????
Wow
My favorite, thanks!
Me being one of the first views not knowing what to say lol
Howdy❤️🙋
Pretty early this time
One of the first here
First
