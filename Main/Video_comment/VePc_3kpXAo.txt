He speaks to a certain generation of misunderstood children and adults, and the way he puts it into music is beautifully articulate.

My favorite track 🙏🏾 I cried listening to this song because a nigga can relate.. raised in the slums of Brooklyn, NY .. came home from school one day to an eviction notice & my mom cried due to embarrassment.. went to college for 2 years & dropped out .. 2 years of working in McDonald’s & joined the U.S Air Force .. 8 years after graduating H.S, I have a brand new Audi & live in an area where I’m the only black person 🙏🏾 sacrifice & invest for your future !

It’s writers like Joyner who still give me hope for the rebirth of hip hop. How is our next generation not inspired by lyracists.

Rozay alwayz killing the beat
R.A.P. 2 RECOVERY #r2recovery.org #pathofdiscovery #dynasrty801
Pusha T need to drop a verse on dis Dope track...
Joyner is his only competition! Walk light young man
Songs bring emotions out when we are alone
Does a collab with Rick Ross but has a song called snitch on the album .....#straightlikethat
Fire my dude!!
Where can I cop this Joyner
https://youtu.be/SuzXYjOf77k 🇲🇦🔥🔥
Nipsey passed the torch🕊💙🦋
In my blood I’m bout it bout it. Love it.
My favorite song from the album. You can feel the power behind both verses. Love bro and thank you for everything you do for us fans! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏🏻🌸well done Joyner you are a LEGEND💕love to you and loved ones😌I can’t imagine how proud your mum must be knowing her boy is infact a living legend.🌸💖
any one else....?   " they gon' love me for my Ambition! "  - Wale
Thanks you for the video Man ❤️🤗😋
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Respect to my G🇰🇪
I strongly think that if Nipsey Hustle was alive today  he would of been a feature on this song.
Haaa !!
Rick Ross ruined this song not gonna lie. His verse did not flow with the message of the song. Would have been a good verse for a different song.
Joyner never disappoints
I hear Nipsey throughout this whole track
We need a music video🙌🏽🙌🏽
Made this beat for Joyner  https://youtu.be/j89DoUXqQxc
I love it gd beat
Damn Ross still on Tory head....Own his masters....shot her in the foot!!! Lmfao this jamming!!!
nearly  this  a  aha. blessings . respect
Joyner you are a goat you tell stories through your music
Yea of course if is Rick ross in the title it will have the most views than the other songs in the album. You bitches

"Now I can live all of the shit I used to dream about cause niggas try to leave me out but I learned to get my revenge thru my success so we even now" CMoN bruh if this nigga don't stop 😪🔥
NIPSEY HUSSLE VIBES!!! That's all I got to SAY🗣💯❤💙
Preach
@ #JoynerLucas can you please go put on a concert for the troops??? I beg you sir.
Sounds like that Nipsey Hussle flo
The only thing Rick Ross sacrificed to get there is other humans in rituals. We know your little worlds.
Sheesh some ppl dont deserve this music I want it all too myself 😂🗣💯✊🏾
I'm happy to see them collab🔥🔥🔥❤👍👍💪💪🙏🙏🤛🤛
Ambitions ...MMG
Joyner giving Nipsey vibes
Joyner Lucas is currently my favourite emo rapper. In the mould of DMX and Joe Budden when it comes telling their depression but still not soft.
Like❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 mood astro🧑‍🚀
Could've had Atleast one song with Chris Brown broo!
@il
💪
This has 2011 wale vibes
ur a racist bro not a legend
No cap This song sounds like it’s inspired by Wale - Ambition
flame nes altyd/flames as always 💥💥💥💥💥💥💣 much love from 🇳🇦
Joyner truly is a legend I was the 1000th comment
WOw
why would you do a track with this correctional officer fake ass rapper.
YouTube; BORN GOD  Character of a Man  CHECK IT OUT
🔥 🔥 🔥
Zim zimma 🇯🇲🇯🇲
Should threw John legand & Mary j on this as well like if agree
This gives me some sense of hope 🖤
0 skips on the ep, alot better than adhd
Best Album we Have in 2020🔥🔥🔥🔥
Back before Joyner got big, he would interact with fans. He earned it. No one can tell him shit
To the fans there since day one.. We all know how good this feels to see our favorite artist finally be appreciated
The hook reminds me of AMBITION by Wale...
Охуенный коллаб👌✌️
Insane
#ALLFACTS LANDOVER,MARYLAND BAWSCOW DA MOBB
🔥🔥🔥Listening from Nairobi,Kenya🇰🇪
Listening from the United States of Africa.🇿🇲
🔥
Love how he flipped the Ambition song
Man the hook is literally a clone of Ambition
Here before a million🔥🔥
Let's be realistic. Joyner is very talented and deserves all the success he works for  yourself to becoming a better personand God bless doto whoever is reading this message
Joyner on Nipsey Flow so wavyy......
Sounds like Ambition featuring Wale
🇵🇰
Yooo 🔥
one of the hardest songs ever
EVOLUTION SLEPT ON🤦🏽‍♂️‼️‼️
Lucas in my top 5....
Why the fuck does literally everyone self proclaim themselves as a legend. A world full of legends with barely any real story.
Yo this album is good music to smoke weed too.
Rip Nipsey #TMC 💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿💨💨💨💨
I remember back then trying to put everyone on  to my guy and nobody noticed. True goat right here protect Joyner at all cost !
Anyone else peep the tory diss
Fire
jill niche Thompson
great words on this
R.i.p nipsey,  RIP Kobe RIP Chadwick.  And all the lost souls we ain't know  you all legends ✊🏿
Needed a Eminem ft tho
The day Joyner dies, this song gon hit different 💔
Joyner you def my Top 5. In my opinion This song would be a lot better without officer ricky  though. You a legend not him. #therealrickrossisnotarapper keep shining though king I aint mad at ya
🔥🔥🔥

(Uh)
Joyner fucken Lukas, ✊🏾much respect 🇿🇦
This song is such a fucking vibe I can't believe it. Love this shit. Joyners solidified his position in the rap game, I'd say he is Kendrick and J. Cole level
Nipsey influenced album
Joyner has a good flow but I really wish he would ride the beat more or maybe find a better beat to fit his style
💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿 yeeeeeeeaaaaaassss LOVE IT!
Joyner keep doin ur thing bruh! Shit is stupid fire, but what do u put out that aint bruh!! Mad love and respect!
This song is straight fire bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I hope Joyner reads these comments sometimes. He needs to truly understand how he is affecting all of our lives and seriously changing the game🔥💯
The hook sounds like he copied wale ambition
I like how many flows this man has
great album but still liking the first 2 better
This will be a classic deep and different but still reliable - perfectly imperfect - I'll b there soon #respect #MusikIsMyAntiDrugz
i kould keel ku 🤣

Chorus= facts🎶🔥🎶🔥🎶🎶
Haven't heard the whole album but is there another better than this master piece....
Damn am emotional right now.... I am born again while drunk.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Humble your self your on your way I like you blessed
who is this guy not already being concidered a legend ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the best
Joyner the fucking GOAT
God Mc shit!!!
God Mc shit!!!
A Joyner x J Cole collab would be lit lit 🔥 🔥 🔥
Meek was suppose to be on this
So why do cell phones have the headphone jack...right were all the pocket fuzz can clog it up...I wanna HEAR this song dammit...
Joyner's flow sounds a bit like Reason here
Damn all I can hear is Nipsey
Wale got off
Love this album Joyner mass stand up ur a legend
I felt this one
🔥🔥🔥🔥🎶💪🏾✊🏾👀
Channeled the spirit of Nip
therapeutic music 👏🏽💯
❤️🔥🔥
🐐🚫🧢
The melody reminds me of AC Odyssey soundtrack (Ezios family) and I LOVE IT
That’s talent son.
Joyner's verses singing what I'm thinking about what the heck is happening in my life tbh🔥👌💯
@dillygotitbumpin 🙏🏽
Thanks i really love this song 💯
Oh maaaan.im here drinking and looked up Joyner,and oh my,what do i find🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
🔥🔥🔥
Rick Ross has one of the best flows in the game! A LEGEND. Period.  Joyner did his thing as usual.  Fire collab!
Please tell me ya sons name is Junior Lucas, if not, missed opportunity fam lmao
Fire rap still playing this to the end
Joyner sounds like nip in the chorus
I love that he's genius
Reminded me of a younger nipsey rip
My favorite song of the album. I played this song a million times yesterday and mostly likely this whole week lol
Love that joyner, nice rhythm... everytime you're working with someone you're just perfect
💯🙌🏽
💪🏾🥶 Much support from us in 618🔷️ @theyunginsg on IG💯Ⓜ️
Long way part 2??????
Had to give this one a thumbs down for putting that fake ass clown Rick Ross on it. Dude goes around rapping about a life he never lived telling kids selling drugs is cool when he was a correctional officer
Love it
Boring traks ever💯❌
Rick Ross threw a shot at Tory lanez 😳

🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠
I salute Joyner is a legend now 🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of "Ambition"
Smh the world don’t deserve this guy 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why Kobe and not me
Didn't like Ross verse but rarely do the rest is a masterpiece
Joyner is a king👑🗣
💯🥊💪
To the person reading this: I wish you all the happiness in the world and lots of success in life!  My dream is to hit 1k and I have been struggling to get there 😩 I appreciate any genuine help 🙏 Thank you
Wooo back baby 🍼  Fire 🔥 My man sound just like rip pop smoke 💨 #Magazinewatts The smoke will never clear https://youtu.be/GAlZYZQ1iaQ Support is fire
“better keep your money close coz that’s the only thing that’s honest,  Everybody thugin till they have to face your honour” 💯 👨‍⚖️
Please if you dislike this song, close your eyes while watching it and just move somewhere else
No eminem this time too?🤦🏼‍♂️
This album is straight Bangerzzz 🔥 👌 💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whoever collabs with joyner he's not a mumbled
Woooooooooooooow
I wonder when Joyner on notice me just need an audience with my legend 😔❤️
Joyner coming in with a Nipsey Hustle vibes...it's fire. A living legend embodying another legend this heat. Plus featuring another. This earned it's title.
Nice
Me tryna hit on a girl in middle school:  sup girl Her: ugh I like tough guys Me: _makes the face from the kid in the video_
If you ain't think Joyner one of the very greatest jus toss yo ass off a bridge head first and call it a wrap🙅
A fucking banger bro 🔥🔥
All the way from Edmonton, Alberta. First name greatest and last name Joyner. An aspiring legend.
I hope this hook doesn't become irony. Dear God, protect Joyner Lucas. I want him to be a living legend for a long time 🙌..
That delivery remind me of Nipsey Hussle 🔥
I want him to take over the game after Eminem.
Thank You Joyner! Waiting for my Collab 🙏🏾💪🏾
This is my life in 2020
This album is already classic 👌😍💯🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Perfect choice to throw Ross on this beat
One of the realest MCs in the game right now
How u teach myself that am a winner even if I lost, damn joyner that therapeutic
Fire From The GodZ  #RAW #MMXX
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gotta be honest as a long time fan, ADHD and Evolution really ain't it for me. 508-507-2209 is still my favorite. _Keep It 100_ and _Sorry_ especially.
Joyner sound jus like nipsey on this... RIP to all the legends 🙏
Better keep your money close that's the only thing that's honest 🔥 Ross 🐐
If you're going through the album looking for a banger... This feels like more of a gap filler between ADHD and the next one😌
you should snitch. hah ha.  Lest the Lord shatter you
Jesus has a grim reaper pet. yea how bout it.  GOATS.  heh. Ignorant.  slaughters goats on the altar. it pays to discover
you become deceived by it then you covet and horde it as if you know about it.  I show you endzone  especially for clone tree in dust tree. God here. shit there goes your and their end of the whatever.  Thats how far you and them gonna push it
Nice
Ross slacked so hard on this verse. This song deserved a way better verse than that. Cole would have sounded better tbh.
Living the dream, remember rick back then, then you get a chance to have him on..  Blessings
Check out the rebel music hes music pretty good
Finally some real meaningful music! I'm an 80's baby with favorite rappers like Em, Jay Z, Method Man, etc. Then it became Men degrading Women for years and it's just annoying after a while. This man right here is my new 2020 rapper! All real life talk👆! God Bless this young Man and i hope that his influence can change this new age mind frame🙏
Eminem's top 17, congrats.
Where are the skits?!???
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Joyner: if I die today I'm going out a fuckin legend Officer Ricky : bitches twerking yada yada counting money
Joyner makes good music.
"I teach myself I'm still a winner even when I've lost"  that line touched me differently cause i really needed that...
Strait Fyre🔥🔥🔥
And another one!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 thank you Joyner!
*Joyner Lucas Ft Logic, Futuristic, Hopsin, Nf, Eminem - SPEEDOM PT. 2* PLEASE
Hope u make a deluxe

Ross takes shots at tory how much your masters really worth Tory: financial freedom Ricky financial freedom stop hating the young man for not staying a slave
I think that's the best song on that album
Nipsey Vibess💎
Had to comment just to change 666 comments to 667
This gave me some Nipsey vibes.  RIP
DILLY GOT IT BUMPIN!!!
Is Rick Ross throwing shades on Tory?🤔
Everyone calling people mcs real mcs had a slow flow made a message and didn't discriminate women talk about drugs and fuckin the world up they kept it positive and when I heard joyners 508 507 2209 album I found my rapper
Fkn fire bro
Sheesh, he spit nothing but true life gems if you was really listening. Joyner is wise and he’s already a legend. That’s already understood.
🔥
Ross a legend too!
As I went threw this album it's more about a message than just a banger
Sounds like a Wale & Rick Ross collab.  Fire 🔥 🤘
Who been rocking with Joyner since Ross Capicchioni? That's when i first got put on.. Then i also grew with him and then listened to the older shit. Anyways check me out as well!! 🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/28ANMFs1qLo

Joyner/Dave East
Legend, this man is a fucking legend Appreciate now 🙏
The album nobody knew they needed!!! 🔥💯
Im I the only one who think this is for  tory lanez.....   Just sayin'
Oh man, again I sub'd to someone because of a message, and I had no idea they were a musician. Well done my man....I truly didn't know you did this, I don't have TV or a phone, I turned society off 15 years ago. I raise my kids, hug my wife, and apparently discover talents my youtube friends have. Im typing this during the first track, Ill listen, but I like what Im hearing so far man. God bless you bro. (edit, not the first track lol, the 11th)
🔥🔥🔥
Nipsey hussle voice rip man
All the way from South Africa Johannesburg. Lucas brought back lyricism and story back to life. Breathe of fresh Air on the real. Rozzy never disappoints. Chorus deep made me think about my life and how far i've come. Long live Hip pop culture. Tshepo Kilani peace out..
Produced by me, Joyner and Rozay really took it to another level though
Hold up, I'm still taking ADHD in. What rock was I under? New album
Joyner the king💓💓
this whole album was a disspoinment like adhd smh like hes not being "joyner lucas" hes trying to be everyone but him self
Joyner did this off rick Ross's "they gon love me for my ambition " song

rowzy amelala
NOLIFESHAQ
Joyner knew real well ADHD was weak so he needed to compensate for it
Got a Fresh Prince ad before this started
Bruh, I thought it was a collab with Rick Astley
Itsbtym to get richer than Trump mmg gor life
GRAMMY
This shit deep asf though
This is a beat I could imagine nipsey being on 😢
Ross been on a lot of features lately and I’m lowkey loving it a lot 🤟🏽
I bet nipsey woulda been on this record if he was still here
"Nipsey. I hear Nipsey. Don't you!?" #DatyleBsllardMusic🐓
🔥
Oh look, it's Rick Ross rapping about cars and bitches. Thought provoking as ever.
Yo Rick Ross been his Feature Bag all year. I love his verse on Benny album. But this right here is real crack.  Not that stepped on shit
The end of the song for some reason there’s like a 2 second clip of ADHD that plays over it lol I think video producer made a mistake
EVOLUTION!
I can't stop saying there're going to love me for my ambitions😎 love this song...if I die I'ma die a legend

Aww man a slow song with rick ross . . I love when he puts out the bangers that get you hyped personally
Here before a million views. Who wit me???
Swear; Jordan's son look just like him. This song was bussin before I even heard him. I literally just saw Jordan & Ross and knew it was gon' be fire & clicked on this jawn & hit the like button before the beat even dropped, lbvs. Now that I've listened...I knew I was right. This joint hard af & deep. Bless these two kings.
This Joyner sucks. I haven't been so hyped for an album in a long time but man this is dissapointing. A whole album about him being racist
This reminds me of nipsey 😖🤗☝️
Way better than the last album🔥🔥
Hey Joyner go check out what I did to the dash of my mustang on my Instagram page @r_customs99

💲
This song made me 😭
Joyner and Meek need to hop on a track
Joyner!!!!
Getting Wale Ambition vibes
I love Rozay no cap. But he could've gone way harder than this. Joyner came through tho💎
Am I the only one that heard Joyner sound a bit like Nipsey 💙🕊
By far best track on album
❤
The question is, is Joyner compromised!?
Nipsy would’ve been proud
Low key sound like nip
Ok ok.. but imagine a remix with Big Willie?!?! Make it happen watch it explode
When you are so early that there aren't lyrics comments
Here before 1million:like Here before 100k:comment  37k gang❤🔥
Best thing about 2020 no cap
Joyner is the fucking G.O.A.T
You cannot deny that message bru "If I die I'm goin out a legend, if they play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected" bru this man is too fire 🔥 💯
I hope you aint had no champagne around Ross 😭🙈
Love from Nigeria 🇳🇬 #endsars
I woke up to notifications going off. Best morning of 2020 so far.
The good news is Joyner Lucas doesn't need to worry about this being in a classic album conversation because this album is definitely far from a classic. how can you be this far in your career and you sound like Nipsey Hussle. You sound nothing like Joyner Lucas
Yes Joyner, if you die today (astaghfirullah) you're going out a legend
reminds me of nipsy
If you can were around for rap music in the 80’s 90’s and early 2000’s..... you better appreciate this shit. Ain’t much of it left 👍
My Idol 💓 🇹🇭
Thank you for the good music Joyner
☝️ of the best Albums of 2020! Straight 🔥🔥🔥
Wheres Marshall?

His first 8 bars reminds me of Wiz Khalifas “So High” melody. 🤘🏻
*joyner lowkey burnt out, the fame gottem. he needa focus on singles*
Dilly got it,baby!
This my favorite so far.
Joyner kinda got a Nipsey Hussle flow on this one
Who TF disliked this? 🤔
This the reason he my favorite artist💯💯💯
I came for this fucking banger
NIPSEY!!!!!????? :-( His spirit lingers in this record...damn!
I love that the chorus is an homage to Wale, Rick Ross, and Meek’s “Ambition”. So far I’m loving this album
Sounds like NIP in a good way

God Made a flawless monster when he created Joyner. Someone who can rap on any beat, have heart trimming lyricism, intractable flow, world-breaking bars, and hella more. This nigga is my ideal thought of pure rap. He definitely one of the greats

(pre chorus)  smile like you worth it play the part of picture perfect camera flashing  souls are crying mirrors crack with pretty faces who  just ask the demons in the room rumours have it you ain’t perfect anymore  been through hell and back again  don’t ask the devil what I did  sold my worth  still insecure  a prisoner  blood on line  the strong survive  the cash the fame they promised no lies I singed it away now I’m saying goodbye..  (chorusx2) I know she wanna be cover girl pretty  she wanna be a goddess to every city  she wanna to feel perfectly easy  not to thick not to skinny  cover girls living in empty worlds  tryna cover up all of the empty wounds  Hollywood’s sleeping next to the rooms then release you when you to high from all the fumes  ohhhh when does the pain stop  ohhh when will the scars fade ohhh when can I go back home  up in the hills they got it all wrong like  ohhhh  (verse 1) growing up fast  growing up from the bottom of the bottle  growing up fast tryna get the figure of a model  broken liquor bottles  broken to fast time will heal, I hope you live to see tomorrow still  I know that picture perfect comes in broken hearts and crushed up pills  learned to never feel, Stone in your eyes I know the devil promised you don’t have to kill.... I know the shadow blocks the light reflecting teers that built inside you lost your mind a hundred times then crossed your wrist and hopped to die I know  blood it dries up like the concrete over secrets  sleeves to cover missing pieces till you feel the tidal waves  come crashing inside the water rise  you try and hide the drowning feeling in your mind  paving the path while looking in a glass frame  hoping someone calls you pretty today cause sometimes you gotta  (pre chorus)  smile like you worth it play the part of picture perfect camera flashing  souls are crying mirrors crack with pretty faces who  just ask the demons in the room rumours have it you ain’t perfect anymore  been through hell and back again  don’t ask the devil what I did  sold my worth  still insecure  a prisoner  blood on line  the strong survive  the cash the fame they promised no lies I singed it away now I’m saying goodbye..
