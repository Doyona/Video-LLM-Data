This confirmed for me aaron is autistic 💙 we take things SO literally 😂😭
Aaron is probably on the spectrum, he always takes things literally :D
Awwww Aaron!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
😂😂😂
😂😂😂💀
The amount of Deadplate TikToks I’ve seen to this audio ❤️
I need a set of Bistro Huddy wigs. Someday i feel like being Brad 😅
Pickles deserves the complement, great haircut bud
How does Aaron survive in the .. Pickles comes. Oh k, everyone's different.
Looove pickles
Joey should still have been flattered. Kinda rude lol
Aaron can't be that dumb.
I have given my compliments to the chef at exactly one restaurant ever. It was a Famous Dave’s Barbecue.
Alternate timeline: Aaron: Hey, Chef!  Table 30 said the food was great. Joey: 'Course he did!  Get the **** outta my kitchen!
For a split, terrifying second, Joey thought Aaron was hitting on him.
Aaron makes me think of the kid you always give an "extra" snickers to lol
Oh, I love Aaron😂❤ they're always so mean to him, but he's so nice and clueless
3 years after vid
normally i understand aaron but this is on him
Pickles!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
How does Aaron drive to work?  Dude is so stupid lol
Oh Pickles! I love your haircut!
Pickles is consistently the best! I want to know him in real life 😊
I've always been curious if they actually deliver the message to the kitchen.
i love pickles 😭
Poor pickles, just wanted a compliment.
Lmaoooo oh Aaron 😆🤣🤣🤣
He said pickles had a great hair cut
😂😂
Joey's responses are always perfection😂
Aw pickles 😂
One time I was in Netherlands with my family. We were celebrating my mom’s birthday at a fancy restaurant. I was 13 and the only person at the table who could speak English. At the end of the meal my family urged me to “give our compliments to the chef”. When I said that to the waitress and especially praised the dessert she told me to go to the kitchen and TELL THE CHEF MYSELF  My shy ass obviously didn’t want to but adult peer pressure made me go and it was so awkward. I guess they thought it would be cute, I did not like the experience
Poor Aaron, he's so dense!😂😂
Aaron's head is all over 😂😂😂 🥰😃❤
OH is this the first episode with real bistro huddy uniforms?
As long as the kitchen staff verbally abuses you, everything is fine, it means they care. When they stop talking bs/ being rude to you, you're in trouble.
A kitchen is a battlefield, the servers are the messengers, the guests are the politicians back home.
Pickles being saucy is still cute.
😂😂😅
Dammit  Aaron!
I think the chefs are my favorite
Pickles needs a spinoff
😂 I'm dying inside because I was Aaron as a server. I just rolled with the punches from the kitchen because at least I made them laugh.
I really do think that there are few positive remarks in this sector.  Sometimes when I'm really enjoying a meal somewhere, I end up meeting some of the staff, maybe talking about cooking.  I get the impression that they get a lot of bitter criticism, some of it unfair as we see in these sketches.  In general life, it's not every day that you meet people who are doing a good job, who know what they are talking about.  I like to speak up when that happens.  Might help someone get a raise, I don't know.  Tell them WHY you're a regular customer.
Table 31 wanted me to compliment you  Awww
😂
This is why aaron is my least favorite character
"Hey, Chef: you look great tonight..." AARON SNED IT!
This was said back when people still said kind and positive things to each other.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Poor sweet pickles
Oh Aaron 😆 🤣 😂
Love your vidéos man❤
You got to love pickles!!!!!
yuh pickless your haircut is greatt
Your acting is always so spot on. As a single person you have created a chemistry between all of these characters and it’s so authentic!
So I’m thinking Aaron’s got audhd, and this is why I don’t want to work food service cuz this is me in my mind but I hide it.
Your haircut looks great Pickles
I love Pickles and his hair.
😊😅😅
I love Joey, getting to the bottom line
Pickles is my favorite
I talk likethat to my severs and other cooks but usually always in a playful way lmao unless it’s a weekend then I really mean it 🤣
*ERIN RULES!*
Hahaha now that is more hilarious than the rest. Bahahahah
Oh my pickles! Your hair looks amazing honey🫶
“Did he mention my haircut?” 🤭🤭❤
I love pickles 😂 ” did he notices  my hair cut
I love pickles
Pickle and Aron 🫣😮🤣
Ok Amelia Bedelia
I was a dishwasher for a few weeks.  The owners gave me toilet duties and I fixed the walk in fridge and I got rid of a useless servers.  I can go back and have a free meal and drink anytime.
Oh pickles!
'Did he mention my haircut?' 😂
I like pickles haircut. Is ok
😂
Pickles come on man. You know it goes without saying that your haircut is phenomenal
One thing that’s amazing to me and I’ve worked in theatre my whole life….when I watch these I find myself forgetting it’s all the same guy..I know every character and they all have their own personalities and I almost think they’re all separate actors…that’s why I think I love watching these….great concept…wish I woulda thought of it !!!
Did he mention my haircut? Oh Pickles😂😂😂
This is too funny!
I don’t think you’d need to be a waiter to realize what he meant 💀
Aaron!!!    😹
Ahhh, pickles, you rapscallion you
This hits 😂😂
OK pickles everyone loves your haircut❤❤❤
Someone put this man in a movie
It be funny to see Aaron and pickles hanging out on a break passing candy back and forth. trying to hype each other up about not being walked on all the time.
Frank, the husband seems like such a good dude. Awful she treated him that way
I never get tired of going out for a meal – thank you wonderful people❤
In my kitchen the servers used to yell "you're beautiful" whenever a customer passed compliments along. It started off as a misunderstanding but just became a bit of an inside joke
How old is Aaron???
#teampickles till I fade out son.
I keep forgetting that Aaron is just Drew Talbert in a wig and not a person I have to feel bad for
The fact that the chef stopped and gave Aaron his undivided attention  is a testament to how great a leader he is😂 Juggling so much Always ascertaining the bottom line Two categories: Do i need to do something about this? Do I not need to do something about this? That's how i was as a charge RN preventingand  putting out fires for 12 hours. (Not as crass, but the motives were the same...keep this bytch a float)
Did he mention my hair cut 😭
No one talking about how goofy and clever this joke is... 😂
Pickles...lol
Aaron is so me-coded at work
Aww pickles 😂
Claasic Aaron
i identify as his sexy hairnet thats looking tight
😂😂
Stolen content
Funny thing is sometimes the kitchen fans and things are so loud you don't realize how loud your swearing at each other or shit talking customers 😅
Forest > Eaters
Lol pickles
I love this!!!❤❤😂😂
Racist hur
Yes Pickle your haircut looks amazing
Pickles is soo cute 😂
Too many years spent in this industry not to absolutely love this channel.. it’s literally so accurate that my wife (non-service work experience only) finally understands what I’ve been trying to explain for years… never stop this is comedy gold
Your videos are actually funny, good job dude, industry ppl love ur content.
Hey can you make a Team Pickles shirt with pickle slices on it? Id buy 10 and wear them at work. Solid black of course! ❤
Pickles needs his own series. He makes me happy whenever I see him
Oh Pickles!😂
😂😂😂
Awwww Pickles, your haircut is superb
Aaron and Pickles on the same autistic wavelength.
Definitely a F I
This reminds me of the :  "Hey Chef !"  "what?"  "you got beautiful eyes"  😏😏
If you wanna compliment the chef,tell the waiter to ask the chef what hos favorite beer/drink is and put one on your tab so he can have a drink after work,thats what i always do😂
I love the kitchen!!!!! Pickles is great!! I love all the kitchen guys!!
Hahaha!
That server has auditory processing disorder cause I do the same thing 😂
I was so confused I’m like wrf is he talking about? 😂
reminder that "have you lost weight" is not a compliment anyway
Pickles! 🤣 I hope someone did get around to complimenting his haircut
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"did he mention my haircut?" ahahahah
DREW To be a personality - Many.  Some so "Hate able", "Love able "  ANd so many EMOTIONS to go with PERSONALITY'S .     YOUR the BEST.   ❤
😂
Why does he look like every wig could be his hair and personality, especially Nico.
I love saying compliments to the chef. I always hope it’s either some crazy dude or a 18 year okd
Awe, Pickles, you’re too cute!😆
I feel bad for aaron hes too pure for this world
Haha did he mention my haircut
They tell you to get the fuck out and then all smile about it when your gone
Funniest thing is when our executive chef comes back after talking to a table and tells us how horrible we fucked it up just for his face to flip and be like "nah I'm just fucking with you, they loved it"
These vids are gettin funnier and funnier 😂
Pickles cuts his own hair 😂
Plot twist: that’s what the customer wanted him to do
Poor Aaron 😂
Pickles ❤️
U look great tonight ✨
Unironically id watch a bistro huddy tv show.
Love your stuff, can't leave comebt cout where it is. Pickles is always my favorite
I think Pickles might be my favorite!
I laughed so hard. Poor Aaron.
I've worked in a kitchen with a greenhorn FOH like this. The big difference was we knew he was such a newbie we gave him kid glove treatment and would give him a pass.  ... Unless he was interrupting the rush like that. Then there's no mercy.
I had an idea for new videos, based on stories from servers:  I little old lady told my friend " I'll have the qwichee."  He told her "one qwichee coming up". Also, I had a guy ask me "what's myoo enster?" (Muenster cheese)
As a cook I wouldn't mind this actually😂
Fukin pickles
The PRIDE when a server comes to say that the food is good. Ahh.   One time someone got food to go and gave a tip. He left, turned around, and came back to give another tip because he said that it was so good. It was THE BEST DAY of my year
Attention all front staff:   STAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN
Pickles is amazing
Pickles 😂
Ha! I love Aaron.
Watching your skirts makes me miss working in restaurants! Super funny and accurate!!  On my first night working in the bar, a customer asked for a blowjob... knew nothing about shooters or cocktails!
And here I was thinking I was the ONLY ONE who noticed Pickles haircut!
Pickles is too wholesome for this worrrlllddd❤😂
This is my favorite show
My compliments to the comment section, the best part.  Thanks, Drew, for creating such a great environment!!!!!
Can we please fire Aaron honestly I cannot watch him do shit like thsi anymore
I snorted my apple juice
Pickles, your haircut is nice😂
Honestly, id have been laughing too hard at the waiter to get angry when I realized wtf was going on. Not only did I get a table wanting it passed on to me how great they found the food, the cinnamon roll new guy was giving me random compliments too? Best day in weeks!
Oh, Pickles…you’re the most handsomest of all handsomes out there and don’t let anyone tell you any different! Roll tide!
Pickles got me 😂 "Did he mention my haircut?"
On busy nights in back of house you can’t remember wtf ticket you had in this scenario. It still feels great knowing they enjoyed it though. 😊
Roll tide!
These are growing on me little by little
this guys acting is so wild to me. i literally forget it’s all one person
😂
Aaron, what a pure soul
Can confirm he was inside a women for 9 months
Pickels I am pretty sure he was talking about your haircut.
That was too Funny 😂😂
Some times I forget there's only one person playing all the roles. The editing and acting is just perfect
Hahaha brillo pad😂
I used to tell my chef "customer said you smelled good"
Gonna try this
Aaron shouldn’t reproduce anytime soon
You can't drink compliments, buy me a beer instead. I'm a raging alcoholic 🍻
Pickles: aaaww ❤️  😂😂😂
Honestly, Pickles is a vibe ngl
Bless Aaron
Aaron is too literal to not be on the spectrum 😂
I love all these characters..
I THINK I DIED 💀😂🤣
Lol Pickles
600
Love your haircut chef. 😂😂😂😂
I wish I witnessed a co-worker do this lol
Im my world, yes, yes he did mention your haircut honey
I was 15 running the grill and service by myself and this couple ordered grilled zucchini fried fish and green beans and grilled squash and I had to whip it up and they said it was so good 😊… but then they left like a one dollar tip 😂man at that moment I realized I needed to work something else.
Aaron make me think of Amelia Bedilia if she was a waitress
Bro “He’s talking about the food you fucking idiot” sounded and looked so real it was perfect 👌
Lmao this is the best one yet! Only cause this happened to my co worker that didn't understand what that meant. The head cook told him to fuck off too 😂😂
Me: compliments to the chef *hands him a $5-$20 bill*
I absolutely hate how I treat every different character as a totally different person despite them being the same person 😭
Oh pickles 😂 you are so precious.
My condiments to the chef...
Awwwwww, Pickles 😊
this man is awesome. he created an entire sitcom, a good one, featuring only himself lol
Aaron and Pickles are natural allies. 👍😜
My fav.
I had a table write me a note on the breakfast I made while working in fine dining in 2019. It's the only note I ever received about the food I cook and I still have it.
I swear Drew, I don't even remember that you're doing every character anymore.
yes pickles you have a good haircut
I fucking love this guy😅 I use to work in a hotel restaurant kitchen as a cook. Best times even when shit hit the fan😂
Pickles!!! ❤😂
Hysterical!!!!😂😂
❤😂
Oh Pickles, your haircut looks great.
😂
This is good, but if you are looking for some constructive criticism, then this is for you. If no, please just tell me to delete the comment, and I gladly will. ❤ you might want to think about getting a specific light for your studio area. This can even be a cheap flashlight, but you have to make sure that you don’t move it, or you will make the stop motion effect less grand. Your among us figures are cute af btw. you might want to think about taking a little more screenshots, but that is totally up to you. I really like your background, but if you are looking for something more spectacular, you can always print out some background papers, and tape them in place. Just saying, this really does help, or at least, it helped me. You might also want to make the music a little louder, or that might just be my iPad ;-; Have a great day though ❤❤❤
I want to totally work back of house now 😂😂
Lmaooo 🤣
I relate so much to Niko lol
Leave Aaron alone,poor thing!
Did he mention my haircut? 😂😂❤❤
“Fries all day!”
i love this channel XD so many laughs :)
Sometimes I get a little sad that I will never see the world through Pickles' eyes.
Dude really rizzed up the chef
Bistro huddy simultaneously makes me really want to work as a line chef and also NOT want to work as a lone chef, same goes for waiter.
awwww pickles 💚
Uhh~~♡
😂😂pickles haircut looks good how dare he not mention that
I love these shorts, it kinda feels like this guy has a split personalities because he acts so good.
I’ve done this before as a joke, a customer said “my compliments to the chef” so I walked to the back and went “hey! You have beautiful eyes.” He didn’t even question it he just went “thanks” and went back to cooking.
Poor Aaron!
pickles and aaron are similar
Bet Dad joke ever😂
Once had a women actually come to the window t thank me for the food, saw her walking over to me and was proper panicking she was gonna complain, then she just melts me heart like that
Omg pickles
Always fun to naw and chew on newbie servers. I'll send them into the stock room to find me a block of dried Mayo we keep behind the shaved elf ears.
I love your haircut pickles
Did that actually happen?
gtfo of my kitchen my favorite line ever
100% true, all the cooks are di*ks to the male servers usually.
Cop: Don’t speed 😡😡😡 Cop 2 seconds later: imma just speed 😇😇😇
Lol
God, Pickles is the best
Table 29 mentioned your haircut, they found part of the cut hair in the food.
Oh... Bless his heart. 🤣
Awww Pickles. I just wanna wrap him in a blanket and feed him milk and cookies
So Charlie (his son) Is in the car. His dad takes a photo triggered a seizure which causes him to stop and go quiet (I can hear him splutter quietly in the vid). Hes wearing a seat covering so he's hidden. His body is left and destroyed a week later.
I don't know how many times I have said, " get the F outta my kitchen!" 😂 😂 😂 🤣
I hate how everyone is so mean to Aaron. Sorry but I feel like he gets bullied a lot. Not a fan of that. Can you do a video where he is treated a little better or some thing really good happens to him? Yes, it was funny and cute but I feel like he gets the short end of the stick all of the time and people are just mean to him. Also love Pickles!! ❤
Pickles we love your hair cut ♥️
Harold. It's a good meme
That's great
I went to Pearl St in Buffalo, I had an amazing Strip. I asked to speak with the man who had fired my steak, they took it as burnt. The waiter, the GM, and the grill master stood in front of me. He grill master was holding is cover in his hands, expecting a chewing. I commence to get into the attention to detail he had give that steak, and how much I enjoyed it. It was not often, even at high dollar brew houses, that level of attention was paid. I continued, as I had been kitchen staff at one point in my life, understand how you would be scared of being berated in front of higher upside. You deserve this tip put in you pocket and and let me talk with you floor and GM. You are the the beat part of this meal. I produced a few 20s and held it up for him. This is your's put it in your pocket.  After he returned to the kitchen, I spoke with the waiter and the GM. I made it clear that that man deserved a raise no matter what he was being paid. And his attitude and attention to detail made my dining experience.   I know it sounds bad bad to be expected to berate someone and then sing their praises. That was never my intent.   I appreciated him and his skills. He reciprocated with extra pot roast and deserts. I hope he got the raise I demanded he got.
No pickles, he did not mention your haircut. I however, will, you look quite fetching
My dad taught me this phrase and i said it to the waiter when I was a wee lass (5-6 ish?). The chef came out to thank me because he thought it was a joke when the server said the little kid sends you their compliments. When he asked me if u said that about his food i suddenly got very shy according to my parents and told him that's what you say in our family when the food is really good! he was so sweet about it and thanked me.
I love the gahh
Perfect display of why servers are narcissists.
Poor pickles, bless his heart. He's just doing the best he can!
Yeah it’s always best to compliment the chef.  There was one one time I just wrote the chef a small thank you note saying that the food was delicious and told the waiter to please give this to whoever cooked my food.  A few minutes later I got a slice of some amazing chocolate cake compliments of the chef, so put good out into the world and you’ll get some back every now and then
your hair looks great pickles
Cooks always respond with the "they better tip than"
Is that Aaron or Pickles?
Oh I did the same shit.. "Hey, Oscar? Table 30 said you have beautiful brown eyes." It took a second for him to remember what it meant each time, but he told me a few months later that it was often the best part of his night.
could I see a collab between you and the Bartender guy?
Aaron is permanently 1 week into his service career
That 1st what of confusion
😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👽
🤣🤣🤣
Haha love this
Congratulations for your haircut Pickles!!! And a happy new Year to the Team
Pickles it looks great.
Oh pickles, you are sweet as pie
Pickles and Aaron, two peas in a pod
Aaron lol
There was a black and white computer paper print out in one of the kitchen's I worked in that said something along the lines of "Compliments to the chef? We don't have a chef. We have a James, he's 18 years old and probably stoned off his ass, but I'll let him know you enjoyed your food."
Lol
I’ve been a cook at a nice club for the past 5 or so years and I love when people give their complements to the chef. Always makes my night better and inspires me to do better.
Oh pickles 🥰
I love your hair. Cut it, Pickles!
Honest question, do chefs really care about this ? Do they even get the message ?
500th comment
A-aron couldn't even manage that
@netflix give this guy a show!!!
Pickles for president!
You look great today....WHAT!?!
More Pickles 🤗
Lmao
I just started following and am oobbbssesseeddd! Can this please be made into a series of some sort! 🥲

I would probably do something like that just to piss the chef off
I love pickles
He kinda sounds like ray william Johnson when he says wtf are you talking about
I normally don’t like or follow any one unless the really entertain me so here is my first like on 1 of ur videos
Your hair looks great, Pickles :)
Nico is the man.
Chef x Aaron | Enemies to lovers | 80k | slow burn
Oh pickles..sweet sweet kinda dumb..pickles. Good for you buddy
Oh Pickles 🥒 🥹🥲  Nice hair cut 💇🏻‍♂️
I promise all Aarons aren't as smart as him. Wait...
You’ve got a NICE…HAIRDO…. 😂👣❤️
One time a waiter walked in the back and said “hey a lady at my table said your steak was the best she ever had”  And the cook said “tf do I care what she thinks?”   And if that’s not kitchen staff in a nutshell idk what is…
Lol u play a good chef. They're always so brusque
“Did he mention my haircut” LMAO the customer can’t even see in the kitchen to see his hair
It's so real, as a BoH it's just... Perfect
wait when did the kitchen upgrade to actual jackets? 😂
“Tips speak louder than words.”
I love pickles!!!@
Pickles goes Awe 😂😂😂
Love these
Pickles always delivers
I love this when see it feel ur seeing all Different characters i dont know how do it thought oluy doing all the Main characters its so Clever and funny am so Addicted to it now keep on going with it. 🤗😄
“Did he mention my haircut?” 🤣
I went to some dive in York one time. Food was really good, so I said "tell Chef I really enjoyed his cooking!"  Chef came out to personally thank me for the compliment.
Hahahahaha man the cooks are my favorite character they're so solid
Yes, some servers are that dumb.
Get the fuck out of my kitchen!
Kitchen couldn't give a rat's ass about compliments all they care about is complaints so they know what to improve on
Jesus these are fucking funny 💀
“Compliments to the chef”, I mean we got Robbie in the back. He’s a stoned 17 year old working part time during high school, but I’ll let him know.
Be kind to people new to the industry. They don’t know what the fuck they’ve gotten themselves into 💜
I love how offended Chef got when Aaron complimented him lol.   Aaron: hey chef...you look great tonight... Chef:...WHAT!??...
"Did he mention my haircut"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why are these so funny?
My favorite BY FAR and your channel has some REALLY GOOD other videos so props to you
Pickles bless his heart
Pickles did you cut your hair? Looks great
Oh Aaronn....
🤣😂
Pickles’ small ‘aww’ was so adorable 😂
My I love this guy!
I love pickles hair. It's OK pickles
Pickles is always so flipping wholesome and must be protected! 😂💖💯
PICKLES WE LOVE YOUR HAIRCUT 😭😭
Pickles is the best
I LOVE EVERY CHARACTER!!! Every freaking one of them. Pickles is my fav. YOU’RE SO TALENTED! Your hard work and effort doesn’t go unnoticed! You’re brilliant. As an ex server every skit is so accurate it’s amazing! ❤️
I love pickles
CUTIE PICKLES HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It was always kinda weird, casually walking into the furious chaos of the kitchen, to say something like "table 13 said everything was delicious" but I felt like they deserved to know 😂
Need to know more about pickles  he's adorable
Best facial expressions
Aw pickles
Pickles is bae
Customer got Aaron🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. But bless his heart, he tries his best. & Pickles🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Did he mention my haircut
Poor Aaron
Poor Aaron 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pickles 😂
Genius
You are a fuckinh amazing actor dude
That dam .. Brad!!!… lol 😂
Lol 😂
Drew is so damn good at different voices and characters I forget there's only one actor lol!
Leave Joey in the kitchen and send pickles out
I ship 💘Aaron and Pickles💕 🥺
The chef is so on point lmao
Did he mention my haircut?
Bro the guy at the end though 🤣😂
Classic Aaron 😂
Pickles, never change.
Bet that's Aaron 🤣🤣🤣
Aaron!
Me, foodrunning: "Yo Andy, they said the food is fire."
I guess one of the worst parts of working in the kitchen was seeing the servers coming in sometimes saying the guests sent their compliments to the chef when I did all the work and he just stood around barking orders not doing anything other than trying the fries.
pickles is a role model and you won’t convince me otherwise
This is why I’ve adopted the “high 5 the chef for me” method.
Is anyone gonna talk about the body language? His body language is really good. The customer's sharp lifting of the chin and slight squint as he speaks really let's my mind run wild on what sort of person he is.
God dammit Aron
🤣😂 pickles is too cute
LMAO Pickles... "Did he mention my haircut?"
It has been a good 15 years since I worked in a restaurant, but it's nice to see that literally nothing at all has changed. Every one of these gives me flashbacks.
There needs to be a sitcom about this with only this guy acting
This is great.👋👋👋 Roll Tide 👍👍👍
Pickles!!!!!
I need more pickles! Lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Till this day I think of this shit
One time when I was a child, right after Ratatouille came out, I went to a terrible local Tex-Mex restaurant with my parents and told the waiter to give my compliments to the chef and he just said “um, ok…”
But do the chefs actually like getting compliments from customers? Or do they not give a damn?
"did he mentioned my haircut?" .. hahahha i kept forgetting his name...
I can never get enough of these videos,I have worked food service for most of my life and really relate to these :)
Pickles for the win!  Your haircut is looking great!
I get a kick out of pickles"🤣
I was in a Shoney's restaurant in West Virginia 30 years ago, when I was mentioned this phrase," My compliments to the chef," to my waitress.  Because I liked the way my steak was prepared at medium rare. She actually went and got the chef and brought him to my table. I was dining with my grandmother BTW.  So, it was not like I was out looking for a man that day. And uh, talk about fate... My name is Mary and his name is Joseph...we exchanged telephone numbers, we started dating about a month later.  A year later we were married! We now have four grown sons and seven grandchildren! 👨‍🍳🥰
Front-of-House Staff: Neat, smiling, get along.  Kitchen Staff: Literal Pirate Crew
This is so god damn unfunny
Big meat there chef ..
That dude looks like Ben askren
I could watch these restaurant skits all day lmao. This reminds me of one time as a server (where I’d say the majority of customers would complain as opposed to compliment), a customer said she wanted to speak with the chef. I jokingly told the customer that the chef would think it was going to be a complaint if I told him that lol. Anyway I went to get the the chef and he, annoyed, said “oh great, now what’s wrong?!” Only to be pleasantly surprised that it was actually a compliment lol. You honestly don’t know what goes on in kitchens but if you know, you know.
Why do I feel like this is a true story
Awe ❤❤❤
Awww. Pickles. ☺️💕
Best one ive ever heard was "my compliments to the photographer"
Gordon Ramsay
He, in fact, could not do that😂😂
This is just dumb enough for me to think, that this happened for real at more than just one place.
Servers were always so dumb 😂
Your haircut is amazing Pickles!🥰
ppl in the comments don’t remember that there was a popular vine with this exact joke?
👏👏👏
Bruh, the cook reminds me of so many people..
the “get the fuck out of my kitchen, gawd” is so perfect lmfao
As some one who worked in a kitchen on the vegas strip these are so accurate 🤣
Out of curiosity are there any fast food workers watching this who have actually heard someone say "compliments the chef"
Lol
😂
Imagine thinking the Chef cooks anything in a restaurant. Lol
Are we actually supposed to compliment  the chef when people say that?? 👀
"Did he mention my haircut??" Haha
Whenever a table said that I would go back and ask who made that particular meal and give them a couple bucks. Then again, my kitchen wasn’t AS intimidating as this one because it was a family restaurant. :D
Awww. I'm going to miss the backwards server shirt for the chefs. :) excited about the fancy new chefs uniforms though.
You look like Eminem
I would like to purchase a Pickles t-shirt. Here please take my money please and thank you.
Damn bruh the eyes keep popping out
I fucking love pickles cuz I was pickles
roll tide
The line cook just laughing his ass off lmao gold
Innocent pickle haha
I love Pickles. I mean, I don't love pickles, but I love Pickles!
BWAHAHAHA
Did he mention my haircut? Oh Pickles
“Did he mention my haircut?” Hahahahahhaha
No more backwards shirt for the chefs 😔
Awwwwww poor pickels dont worry your beautiful hair is like a lions maine fabulous
this mf looks like the irl version of jon arbuckle
Normalize tipping the cooks.
We love your haircut, Pickles!
Pickle 😂
My dad told me a story of when he went to a fine dining restaurant with my mom. He told the waiter the exact same thing, “my compliments to the chef.” A few minutes later the waiter came back and said “while the chef appreciates your kind words, he’d like to let you know he cannot drink compliments.” A touch of class by him.
my haircut😂😂
Did he mention my haircut?
The: did he mention my haircut  part got me
This was funny actually.
Pickles is sooo endearing !!
Dude, you have impressive amount of wigs
Its almost like the guest knew Aaron was gonna miss understand it, look at that smug fuckin face

Pickles, your hair is amazing, we love you 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 *makes a few family meals Italian-style for the servers and kitchen*  Love you guys 🥰🤌🏻 (pesto parm with garlic bread and lemon sparkily water to drink 💖✨)
Did he mention my hair cut 😂😂
The chef was like Space Marine, too angry to even be happy when receiving compliment
Can somebody please compliment Pickles?!
My compliments to the new chef coat
When I was a kid I would stand by the kitchen door and observe I was a strange kid
I work the line. I swear to god, the new servers where i work are like this. Every time. Like clockwork. "Heeeeeey, this looks nice and beautiful!" then i get a overwhelming urge to remove my work boot to throw at them. "Shut the F@#$ Up, Steve! That's a 45min ticket, i better not see you eating it and coming back after you 'lost it' again!!"
I spent most of my adult life in the food service industry. I can’t get enough of these!
Well now I'm gonna say this no matter how good or bad hoping this happens at least once even if I never see it! A memory I created but was never involved in 😆
This is the first corny video I’ve seen out of the first 300. Keep up the good work brudda I know this was supposed to be cringe
Everybody is mentioning pickles but cackling bandana guy made this all come together.
Pickles4ever

That last chef! 🤣🤣
Pickels is my fav
Fries all day !!!
Honestly this isn't normally my style of comedy but you put so much work into these I'll subscribe anyway because I genuinely appreciate how high quality these are.
That Curly Wig 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
O Pickles 😂🤣
"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Romans 10:9
🤣 🤣 🤣
Pickles, your hair looks great 👍
Roll tide
Nows that funny.
My chef would stare at me and ask why i even took the time to bring a compliment in the kitchen
Oh man how could he not mention pickles new hair 🤣
Please tell me there aren’t really servers that do this 🤣
Every chef I’ve ever met…
Pickles is still my favorite! We share a nickname lol
LOLOL! U are so funny! I can always rely on your channel to get a laugh! Love pickles! Loved the Vegas vid. ( I live  here) Love to see u guys do another one . It was really good wherever the team takes off to!
I love pickles lol 😆
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Yo! Buddy got new shirts and customized chef jackets for everyone! Wot wot! Nice man no more backwards button up for you son 😁 roll tide
I need fries all day!🤣🤣
😂😂😂Every cook is ALWAYS mean!!
Man it's still ackward when server comeback and say table so an so says it was amazing, I'm just like thumbs up, unless you one of the girls turn around and compliment me
"get the fuck outta my kitchen" #1 phrase in any kitchen that is running properly.
The facial expressions 😄😄😄
pickles i would die for you
It's a simple algorithm. I see Drew's videos I hit the like video before the video even starts.
I need three fries all day?? 😂
This is so great
Yo get the f*** out of my kitchen was great
Those wigs are killing me 😂😂😂
Bro the mf is comedy!!!
Your hair looks lovely, pickles
I love pickles 😆
We need a whole series on Pickles! 🥺
No joke, some guy actually did this one time. Kid was like 16 or something and everyone in the kitchen wouldn't let him live it down for a month lol
Every time my table says: "compliments to the chef " he says: "did they send us any money?!"  - no - f*ck them then!
These still never not be funny. The '80s perm wig? WHERE DID HE EVEN FIND THAT? 😂
Live this stuff.. My compliments to the what is it you are again just kidding thanks
When is Timothy heading back in for some chow?
😂😂😂
YOU SHOULD DO “FIRST ONE IN LAST ONE OUT” walk-in closet labels. I’d get yelled at if I used a sauce that was dated 1/17/22 in stead of the older one 1/16/22 make sense ?
My Compliments to Drew
I was NOT expecting that lmfao
I was working one day and I heard one of the servers say 2 someone else “I told Rob (a cook ) he looked good today and he said it’s cuz he’s wearing a mask “ shit was so funny 2 me
wow😭
This content is so funny and amusing to watch it really makes me consider getting a job at a restaurant, I have 0% experience working at a restaurant. 😂
Liking the new chef jacket!!
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
I live for these videos. I laugh when people tell me this, working at a steakhouse- we have line cooks not chefs 🤣
Why is the Chef so bitter? Hate his job?
Bless Pickles, so adorable
Awww
Watched every video
They have new uniform now, it looks good!
I was expecting a close up on the chef at the end as he turns away from everyone else.  A small, slight smile momentarily crossing his mouth.
Hahah fuck you got me with Pickles comment 🤣😂😂
Awe Pickles. I like your haircut 😀
The walls look like beef
he looks like that one guy is successful but still lives with his parents
Pickles is so pure.
Fuckin accurate. I hated being a cook, I'll never go back.
Pickles really gets me.
I had to like the video for the ending  "did he mention my haircut?"🤣
Hahaha, I love Pickles! I keep asking for more of the cooks in the comments. Thanks Drew! Love your channel!
Pickles SMDH! ROLL TIDE.
Aaron and Pickles are so naive and innocent. This is one of the most well acted skit channels on YouTube. I love it here.
🤣😂😭‼️
This site keeps my spirits up every day my compliments to DT!!!   Roll Tide
Yeah coke will do that to ya.
Love pickles
Btw if you say this to the server and they actually convey that message to the cook it can be a great pick me up on a stressful night for the cook.
Lol so funny
Love your stuff man
:D
Your hair looks great, Pickles!
Your haircut looks great Pickles!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Literally a vine
Aww, Pickles 😂😂
Roll Tide
Idk why but this is my favorite video yet 😂
I love you Drew, almost fell out of my car was laughing so hard!!!! "You look great tonight, have you lost weight?!"  WHAT THE "F" U TALKING ABOUT, HES TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD U 'f-ing' IDIOT,  OUT OF MY KITCHEN, gawwwd" 😅🤣😆😆😅🤣🤣😆🤣😂😅😆
Loving the wigs 😂
“Did he mention my haircut” got me
I started waiting tables at a little local truck stop at 13, my mom was my cook we were the overnight  crew.  Never very busy. Just a few tired travelers,  local  cops and truckers until 5am when the farmers came in for coffee and listening to the farmagi report on the radio at 5:30 kkoy i believe. I was trained by 2 women who had been truck stop waitresses since the 50s and 70s.  Did that until i was 15. Off and on when i needed to pick up extra money i pulled shifts outside of my regular job.  At 25 i went to work with my parents at their cafe.  I have since worked both front and back of house until i "retired" 15 years ago.   I can tell you i have experienced about 90% of what you show.
Bffahahaha did he mention me haircut?? 😖🤣😭
Somebody better complement my man butters, The ole Huddy can’t run without him!
You know I think the next time I go out to eat I'm going to pay the waiter to go compliment the chefs appearance just so I can imagine this happening
PICKLES
your description lmao
lmfao next time "chefs kisses" will take a turn
Pickles 😂
Your character, Pickles, is a hoot!
Diner: My compliments to the chef. Server: You’re so damn sexy😘
Eh, he got a real chefs shirt
Nobody ever thinks the cooks you trip your waitresses you tip the girl at Sonic nobody ever shows the cooking you love and they're the real ones that make sure your food is the way you want it and taste good the other people just write down your order
ROLL TIDE
That last guy just wanted to be shown some love lol
I remember that vine
I love you pickles! You're haircut looks so good!
Pickles!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is fantastic 👏 I wish I could give this endless thumbs up
"Did he say anything about my haircut?"  Those last minute little quirks are a scream.  Gotta' love Pickles.
I hope there's a real Pickles somewhere out there
Love your hair Pickles!😂❤️
Pickles always has the last joke of the kitchen skits. 😂
he a little confused but he got the spirit
Oh, Pickles. 😂 👍
I've used that exact "What" he said so many times working in food. I swear it's really like this 🤣🤣
Oh, sweet Aaron... 😂
Hair cut is fire assistant 🤣
Why does the chef always say “all day”? It’s kinda annoying lol
The chefs actually got chefs jackets now
This was a great meal-I mean skit. My compliments to the YouTuber.
What one is pickles?
I just realized that the bottom of their shirts say pickles. Pickles is moving up!!!
Gotta love🥰 Pickles 😅
That server is always going to be lost in the sauce, and here I thought nobody was slower than Pickles
😂😂😂😂 actually heard similar..years ago...
Pickles your hair cut is awesome
Servers are really this stupid though sometimes
Awww pickles!!!!!! I love your haircut!!!!!
Picklesssss
Does the server actually compliment the cooks if the guests ask them to?
Need more Pickles
Omg I love the cooks 😂😂😂😂
Lmao 🤣 cmon that’s not real.
😑
🤣🤣😭🤣🤣
Forget the costumes, it’s his eyes that sell every character as a different person
The chef was a microwave
I want to see full length episodes! I can't get enough of these characters!
Man I wish the head chef would’ve become tsundere and appreciate the compliments :/
My compliments to you Drew 😂😂 thanks for the consistent laughs
😂😂😂😂😂always spot on.. 😂💕💙💙
You're my favorite content creator
I love the clips with the Chefs haha
Not understanding "my compliments to the chef" paves the way for not understanding "this tip is for the chef" he's not playing dumb he's playing 3d chess
Pickles is the goat.
Did you get a haircut, Pickles??? Looks good, my dude.
Keep rolling these gems out!🤣👏👏👏👏👏
Pickles rules. I kinda miss the backwards white dress shirts, but alas time moves on.
I was wondering if you could do an episode on the customers that you find in every restaurant Like the old guy who always coughs extremely Loud and nasty the whole time  Or the regulars that are always complaining about everything yet they always come back  Or the valley girl  Or the family that lets their kid run around the restaurant unattended Just some ideas ! I've been loving your videos since I work as waitress ad well
Done some kitchen assistant work the other day. Yer I don't miss peeling potatoes 😂. Keep me at a busy bar any day.
*My compliments to the chef* * After 20 years of a marriage *  "And that's how I met your father" "Dad he meant the food"
My chef would always get annoyed and some how take it as an insult as if the food is not always that great. And then just shoo me away
If this isn't me...
Your wife must love dressing you up as chicks.
My COMPLIMENTS to Drew Talbert.🌷 His videos are relatable, funny & entertaining!
Roooooolll tie

My compliments to Pickle's haircut!

I look forward to your shorts so much. They really do make my day better.

Never fails to make me laugh
I love his angry chef character
Pickles, your so precious! Hey Chef, your doing a great job!  No wonder the restaurant is a success!
Well, he does look great.
Oh Pickles stole the whole video
I'd like to see the real life Pickles that the character is based on. I think most of us would haha
Lol I watched this like right when it came out and didn’t even notice it was his new video
Lmaoooo “Get the f*** outta my kitchen” savage chef😂😂😂

Pickles is such a precious character 🥺 And your haircut looks amazing!
Lol! You gotta love Pickles!
How many wigs do u have??!!
Pickles you're lovely!
roll tide?
Well, at least he tried compliment the chef lol

Sort of joke that I'd make. 😁
Man, looking at you videos made me realize i was the Pickles back when i worked at a restaurant... AWSOME!
There were times where I would cook the food AND serve it when it was slow. The best was getting complimented on the food even though they don’t know you made it and then also getting complimented on the service.
Didn't even knew there is someone who doesn't know about this lul
Pickles, your hair looks great 👍
i love pickles
.
