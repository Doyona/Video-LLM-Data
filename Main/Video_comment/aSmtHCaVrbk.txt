Well done Matt Hancock 👏👏 for drilling your secretary and screwing your future 🤣🤣
He took that to POUND TOWN!!!!
Evil man thank jesus he's gone

At last the 'Lightweight' has gone. Now we wait to see if his mistress kicks her 'taxpayer funded money pit'  into touch, as clearly, HE HAS PASSED HIS USEFUL SELL BY DATE !!!!
Its safe to say matt handoncocks lover has had more than two jabs behind that closed office door huh? 🤣
I can't stand right wing Tory conservatives, but occasionally every now and then they manage to ascend to such gut laughing, roll on the floor barrell laughing levels of incompetence that I just can't help but love them. Send in the clowns!
Basically, never be a politician if your name ends in 'cock'.
Do any government ministers have integrity ?  This scenario is common, normalised  by BJ
It's all a lie. Watch its coming... Project bluebook....

Give us another mock weeping display, Matt.  It's so entertaining.
we now know why borris caught it.
Creepy
That letter is quite revealing, there is going to be massive changes in the NHS and social care, and mental health. It won't be for the better going off what's been happpening these last year and half. Very sinister and it's not just the nhs they are hanging
It's a pity Boris haven't resigned
“Spend more time with my family” (from behind the 5 bar gate with a scowling spouse in background).
What I say.  https://youtu.be/KOiu7FuIc0Y
Seriously jus a 💋 since when UK become so difficult. Trust me he took the best shot already.
Really, is that it?
I'd like to think this will be the end of the weasel political career? But I fear that being the slimy character he is? He'll ne back at some point
Basically the coxk has handed himself out....the affair was actually a bullshit plandemic which he messed up on and as protocol he had to leave and soon will dissappear from this  bullshit platform...
Bad lady take a guy to the hell, suggest?
The camera in Matt’s office has been disabled. Now Mr Hancock’s replacement will be able to get his leg over without fear of discovery lol.

cheerio cheerio CHEERIO!
Resignation is not enough. He and his mistress should also be forced to pay the GBP 800 fine !
More lost documents mr prime minister
I uh, can’t uh, believe uh, this uh
For the love of god! leave this man alone ,like the rest of us, he,s a human being, he will compensate his wife "god bless her" and hopfully retire in peace, would anyone else liked his job during the pandemic?eh? how many people at this very moment are enjoying a "kiss" with someone from another household, behind closed doors, whoever "casts the first stone" look at yourselves,are we all saints and angels? good luck to anyone who finds "love" in this climate,! including people like Matt Hancock,    good luck , one life ,"live it!!!"
Extra ringpeace in the workplace 😍👌💩
This present Conservative party cabinet  is nothing but a comedy of errors, and full of Tim dim but nice characters, I would like to see Boris support the public like he does for he's law breaking cabinet chums, smh what a laughing stock we must be on the world stage...forget Trump, we should make sure Boris only gets one term in power also..
Slimy little shitball telling us what to do. Hahaha worm.
He helped with the very rules that brought the country to a standstill.  Damaging:  Relationships Businesses/economy  Mental health  He takes those rules and pisses all over them. This man shouldn't just resign, he should be charged.
Did he get the girl?
GOOD
He goes home with a big pay check + 20% of the NHS contracts deals  made by  buddies and for purchasing some  junck labeled PPE.
Fxxking hopless Boris
What a living sneaky cheating vile Mancock
Resign??? He should be FIRED!
Never want to see this guy again what a joke
Fxxk off Hancock Empty words Changing topic as always
Hancock is a  smirking lier. Should be sacked long time ago. He cared about as as much he cared about his own wife that moment when he betrayed her.
smug dude.
This the best news in a long time all we want is Boris to resigned next so glad this little weisel has gone but I'm sure he will be the next to dish the dirt on the government
'To be honest when we have let them down'/get caught out, only when we get caught out... another drama that will definitely distract the public, as planed.
What's wrong with f@cking someone else's wife? That's life!
Advising- so that's what they call it nowadays. Gives a whole new meaning to Hancock's Half Hour.
Doormat Hancock is an utter disgrace spineless and characterless
This dude strangely looks like Prince William
It’s a shame Matt had an affair & I feel for his wife.. but we shouldn’t forget he was an excellent minister & it’s a shame he’s had to go..
Good riddance
His apology means nothing! Their actions at the G7, Ascot and other functions that have been seen says it all!! It seems covid only comes after the day to day people but it doesn't affect the toffs !! They can shove their regulations, this proves covid has nothing to do with public health it's a political virus!!
He was always excellent at been hands on it’s a great loss.🤣
She is hot tbf..
Absolute fraud
Thats the nut off it! 🤣
Nevermind that..... People should be asking how F did the sun newspaper managed to get the video?????????  And why didn't they try to blackmail Conservative Party. Becouse that's what Rupert Murdock and  Epstein been doing for years. And familys are destroyed thanks to rupurt madock!
how can that be private life when he is paid by our fcking taxes and does his sect act in his place of work we are again paying for?????
The biggest problem is how a spy camera gets. In a government department it could have been a bomb security is at risk
All staged
What about his wife is she going to continue with him? He was cheating on her come on woman.  What bout the husband of the woman he was kissing????
Thats bullshit there's more to it
Memo With Reference to  The Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP. Ex Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.   As a citizen of this great nation, I must say that the Health Secretary, the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP, a man of greatness and virtue has been tirelessly protecting the British people from almost certain death because of a very dangerous and highly pathogenic virus, which, if not stopped, could kill millions of people. This hero, who knows no bounds, must be elected Prime Minister post haste for his gargantuan life saving efforts. He simply made a very small, minuscule mistake, which must be forgiven by the nation if we are to be loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.   Just because this warrior of true manliness and self sacrifice went against his own edicts and true desire to save the nation, on this one glorious occasion, does not mean a thing. For one man committing an infraction or even a few against his own social distancing rules, but at the same time, has kept 67 million Britain’s from going against these highly important commands, and has worked tirelessly to save us from our own stupidity. He even told us how glad he was that Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from his post after that awful folly. This shows that the honourable gentleman understands the importance of these most noble of government policies.    During these challenging times, the slightly Fawlty judgement and therefore accidental breach of protocol by Mr Hancock, must be forgiven. We as a nation, must understand that just one or two possible extra cases of covid 19, which could well turn out to be completely asymptomatic at that, is nothing compared to a potential 67 million  British deaths from this terribly dangerous and wretched disease. In fact, Mr Hancock should be praised and likened to the Man of Steel, Superman himself, for facing up to this deadly virus with his super strength and penetration and therefore protecting this most important and vulnerable aide by heroically standing between her and it! He has truly demonstrated his bravery by facing up to this invisible and stealthy enemy as we, his loyal subjects, fearfully cower behind our sofas, not wanting to come out until it is absolutely safe to do so.   We must therefore face the fact, that we must allow our wonderful self sacrificing leaders to breach the rules once in a while, when they see fit, as they are acting as a barrier between us and this dangerously lethal infection.   Had he allowed us to walk around unprotected and hug our grannies and shake peoples hands while allowing our businesses to stay open and not go bankrupt, as well as allow the people to venture out of their homes for pointless and frivolous reasons and not mask up and therefore not face extreme depression and anxiety, as well as to not be coerced into injecting themselves with a dangerous bio weapon, then most of the population of our great nation would most certainly have perished already and that is absolutely unacceptable!!  So to end this most important and pertinent message, this man is a hero, if for nothing else, then at the very least for taking charge and demonstrating to the British people the true essence of leadership by its political elite.   Bravo I say to the future Prime Minister of this great and powerful nation!   Rule Britannia! Britannia Rule the World!   Applause Please!!!!!!!

Just because this warrior of true manliness and self sacrifice went against his own edicts and true desire to save the nation, on this one glorious occasion, does not mean a thing. For one man committing an infraction or even a few against his own social distancing rules, but at the same time, has kept 67 million Britain’s from going against these highly important commands, and has worked tirelessly to save us from our own stupidity. He even told us how glad he was that Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from his post after that awful folly. This shows that the honourable gentleman understands the importance of these most noble of government policies.    During these challenging times, the slightly Fawlty judgement and therefore accidental breach of protocol by Mr Hancock, must be forgiven. We as a nation, must understand that just one or two possible extra cases of covid 19, which could well turn out to be completely asymptomatic at that, is nothing compared to a potential 67 million  British deaths from this terribly dangerous and wretched disease. In fact, Mr Hancock should be praised and likened to the Man of Steel, Superman himself, for facing up to this deadly virus with his super strength and penetration and therefore protecting this most important and vulnerable aide by heroically standing between her and it! He has truly demonstrated his bravery by facing up to this invisible and stealthy enemy as we, his loyal subjects, fearfully cower behind our sofas, not wanting to come out until it is absolutely safe to do so.   We must therefore face the fact, that we must allow our wonderful self sacrificing leaders to breach the rules once in a while, when they see fit, as they are acting as a barrier between us and this dangerously lethal infection.   Had he allowed us to walk around unprotected and hug our grannies and shake peoples hands while allowing our businesses to stay open and not go bankrupt, as well as allow the people to venture out of their homes for pointless and frivolous reasons and not mask up and therefore not face extreme depression and anxiety, as well as to not be coerced into injecting themselves with a dangerous bio weapon, then most of the population of our great nation would most certainly have perished already and that is absolutely unacceptable!!  So to end this most important and pertinent message, this man is a hero, if for nothing else, then at the very least for taking charge and demonstrating to the British people the true essence of leadership by its political elite.   Bravo I say to the future Prime Minister of this great and powerful nation!   Rule Britannia! Britannia Rule the World!   Applause Please!!!!!
Memo With Reference to  The Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP. Ex Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.   As a citizen of this great nation, I must say that the Health Secretary, the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP, a man of greatness and virtue has been tirelessly protecting the British people from almost certain death because of a very dangerous and highly pathogenic virus, which, if not stopped, could kill millions of people.

Had he allowed us to walk around unprotected and hug our grannies and shake peoples hands while allowing our businesses to stay open and not go bankrupt, as well as allow the people to venture out of their homes for pointless and frivolous reasons and not mask up and therefore not face extreme depression and anxiety, as well as to not be coerced into injecting themselves with a dangerous bio weapon, then most of the population of our great nation would most certainly have perished already and that is absolutely unacceptable!!  So to end this most important and pertinent message, this man is a hero, if for nothing else, then at the very least for taking charge and demonstrating to the British people the true essence of leadership by its political elite.   Bravo I say to the future Prime Minister of this great and powerful nation!   Rule Britannia! Britannia Rule the World!   Applause Please!!!!!
Memo With Reference to  The Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP. Ex Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.   As a citizen of this great nation, I must say that the Health Secretary, the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP, a man of greatness and virtue has been tirelessly protecting the British people from almost certain death because of a very dangerous and highly pathogenic virus, which, if not stopped, could kill millions of people. This hero, who knows no bounds, must be elected Prime Minister post haste for his gargantuan life saving efforts. He simply made a very small, minuscule mistake, which must be forgiven by the nation if we are to be loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.   Just because this warrior of true manliness and self sacrifice went against his own edicts and true desire to save the nation, on this one glorious occasion, does not mean a thing. For one man committing an infraction or even a few against his own social distancing rules, but at the same time, has kept 67 million Britain’s from going against these highly important commands, and has worked tirelessly to save us from our own stupidity. He even told us how glad he was that Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from his post after that awful folly. This shows that the honourable gentleman understands the importance of these most noble of government policies.    During these challenging times, the slightly Fawlty judgement and therefore accidental breach of protocol by Mr Hancock, must be forgiven. We as a nation, must understand that just one or two possible extra cases of covid 19, which could well turn out to be completely asymptomatic at that, is nothing compared to a potential 67 million  British deaths from this terribly dangerous and wretched disease. In fact, Mr Hancock should be praised and likened to the Man of Steel, Superman himself, for facing up to this deadly virus with his super strength and penetration and therefore protecting this most important and vulnerable aide by heroically standing between her and it! He has truly demonstrated his bravery by facing up to this invisible and stealthy enemy as we, his loyal subjects, fearfully cower behind our sofas, not wanting to come out until it is absolutely safe to do so.   We must therefore face the fact, that we must allow our wonderful self sacrificing leaders to breach the rules once in a while, when they see fit, as they are acting as a barrier between us and this dangerously lethal infection.

For one man committing an infraction or even a few against his own social distancing rules, but at the same time, has kept 67 million Britain’s from going against these highly important commands, and has worked tirelessly to save us from our own stupidity. He even told us how glad he was that Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from his post after that awful folly. This shows that the honourable gentleman understands the importance of these most noble of government policies.    During these challenging times, the slightly Fawlty judgement and therefore accidental breach of protocol by Mr Hancock, must be forgiven. We as a nation, must understand that just one or two possible extra cases of covid 19, which could well turn out to be completely asymptomatic at that, is nothing compared to a potential 67 million  British deaths from this terribly dangerous and wretched disease. In fact, Mr Hancock should be praised and likened to the Man of Steel, Superman himself, for facing up to this deadly virus with his super strength and penetration and therefore protecting this most important and vulnerable aide by heroically standing between her and it! He has truly demonstrated his bravery by facing up to this invisible and stealthy enemy as we, his loyal subjects, fearfully cower behind our sofas, not wanting to come out until it is absolutely safe to do so.   We must therefore face the fact, that we must allow our wonderful self sacrificing leaders to breach the rules once in a while, when they see fit, as they are acting as a barrier between us and this dangerously lethal infection.   Had he allowed us to walk around unprotected and hug our grannies and shake peoples hands while allowing our businesses to stay open and not go bankrupt, as well as allow the people to venture out of their homes for pointless and frivolous reasons and not mask up and therefore not face extreme depression and anxiety, as well as to not be coerced into injecting themselves with a dangerous bio weapon, then most of the population of our great nation would most certainly have perished already and that is absolutely unacceptable!!  So to end this most important and pertinent message, this man is a hero, if for nothing else, then at the very least for taking charge and demonstrating to the British people the true essence of leadership by its political elite.   Bravo I say to the future Prime Minister of this great and powerful nation!   Rule Britannia! Britannia Rule the World!   Applause Please!!!!
Memo With Reference to  The Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP. Ex Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.   As a citizen of this great nation, I must say that the Health Secretary, the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP, a man of greatness and virtue has been tirelessly protecting the British people from almost certain death because of a very dangerous and highly pathogenic virus, which, if not stopped, could kill millions of people. This hero, who knows no bounds, must be elected Prime Minister post haste for his gargantuan life saving efforts. He simply made a very small, minuscule mistake, which must be forgiven by the nation if we are to be loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.

Had he allowed us to walk around unprotected and hug our grannies and shake peoples hands while allowing our businesses to stay open and not go bankrupt, as well as allow the people to venture out of their homes for pointless and frivolous reasons and not mask up and therefore not face extreme depression and anxiety, as well as to not be coerced into injecting themselves with a dangerous bio weapon, then most of the population of our great nation would most certainly have perished already and that is absolutely unacceptable!!  So to end this most important and pertinent message, this man is a hero, if for nothing else, then at the very least for taking charge and demonstrating to the British people the true essence of leadership by its political elite.   Bravo I say to the future Prime Minister of this great and powerful nation!   Rule Britannia! Britannia Rule the World!   Applause Please!!!!!
Memo With Reference to  The Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP. Ex Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.   As a citizen of this great nation, I must say that the Health Secretary, the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP, a man of greatness and virtue has been tirelessly protecting the British people from almost certain death because of a very dangerous and highly pathogenic virus, which, if not stopped, could kill millions of people. This hero, who knows no bounds, must be elected Prime Minister post haste for his gargantuan life saving efforts. He simply made a very small, minuscule mistake, which must be forgiven by the nation if we are to be loyal to Her Majesty the Queen.   Just because this warrior of true manliness and self sacrifice went against his own edicts and true desire to save the nation, on this one glorious occasion, does not mean a thing. For one man committing an infraction or even a few against his own social distancing rules, but at the same time, has kept 67 million Britain’s from going against these highly important commands, and has worked tirelessly to save us from our own stupidity. He even told us how glad he was that Professor Neil Ferguson resigned from his post after that awful folly. This shows that the honourable gentleman understands the importance of these most noble of government policies.    During these challenging times, the slightly Fawlty judgement and therefore accidental breach of protocol by Mr Hancock, must be forgiven. We as a nation, must understand that just one or two possible extra cases of covid 19, which could well turn out to be completely asymptomatic at that, is nothing compared to a potential 67 million  British deaths from this terribly dangerous and wretched disease. In fact, Mr Hancock should be praised and likened to the Man of Steel, Superman himself, for facing up to this deadly virus with his super strength and penetration and therefore protecting this most important and vulnerable aide by heroically standing between her and it! He has truly demonstrated his bravery by facing up to this invisible and stealthy enemy as we, his loyal subjects, fearfully cower behind our sofas, not wanting to come out until it is absolutely safe to do so.

Dominic Cummings warned Hancock if he didn't confess about the lies he would release the video and photographs.  So that is what he did he released them to the Sun.  Anyone would have done the same if they were been made a liar.  Dominic Cummings had no choice but to release them.
best thing he ever did as was resign as he has unknowly given us the means to get rid of boris  next year in public enquiry . As we will likey see him turn on Boris the way Cummings has.
Bloody good riddance,  little weasel
He is performing mouth to mouth CPR.
First Dom's eyesight, now Matt dipping his wick. Hopefully it all comes crashing down around Boris. He doesn't deserve to serve until 2024. Anyone who votes Tory after everything that has gone this past year and half alone is nothing more than a traitorous regime collaborator propping up a corrupt and inept government.
I always thought he was a weasel from the beginning.
We need to get all the boomers out of parliament, it almost seemed like this was a cheap attempt at finding something to publish to the nation, this is bottom of the barrel media content almost as a distraction for real story’s of heroism.  A disgrace to the UK and loyalty to those who are family not an example to follow, and during the pandemic, I officially believe due to this the pandemic is over and it’s just the media trying to engulf the nation with ludicrous and mediocre news.  It’s time for a reform in parliament it’s a comedy show, it’s not 1995 anymore
STAY HOME . DONT SHAG YOUR AIDE . SAVE WIVES . 😅😅😅😅😅
They are all a bunch of LIARS, Fake &  not fit for their positions.  Boris should resign too. Lol. Can't believe how they fool the British people.
Why do all "conservatives" cheat?
Covid 19 is the biggest scam of this century
Nice to see good news for a change
Leave Matty alone 😥
Too late. People are waking up to your FAKE streen media BS political  THEATRE system.  People are not buying this story about matt hangcock
Headline ' Matt Hancock keeps MPs job...'
Brilliant news! karma
I think the goverment needs a RESET😂😂😂
This is just the icing of the cake of a load of political bollocks... He's spent the last year telling the UK to stay away from everyone and protect the NHS then is snapped with his tongue down some girls throat...nice way to show your gratitude to the NHS Staff for putting their lives on the line Hancock 👍
Finally justice was made!!! Still many more to go.... Couldn't see he's cold face,narcissistic, bustard ,fake anymore!! Nothing new for those who knows very well what's going on behind this pandemic!! What a fake cold speech!!
Remember to verify your clocks guys
Shagger
Ew, why do people vote stupid?
THE EVIL THAT MEN DO… TAKES THEM UNAWARE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Scummy pair ,,No thought for THEIR own families .
Lol sajid javid just replaced him ffs
These hemorrhoids just won’t go away and my arse is constantly itchy
Knew all along he was a cock
It’s not his private life he was working and he broke rules.
He should have been arrested !
The only good thing to come out of this is if women find him attractive then there's hope for me
How can anyone trust this government?
Arrogant, self centered and rotten....... That wasn't an apology! He's making a pitch! 🤢
Han cock just a puppet and idiot , nothing else
Cant wait to see Mock The Weeks take on this....
Is there an extended video of them having sex?  I promise not to look at him.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙄
I wonder when they creat impossible rules these so called "commoners only laws". Do they think it is funny? Because we follow when they do not follow their own rules? They must think we are really stupid to follow the rules.
Should resign as MP too miserable so and so ...
More hyprocery total idiot should have been sacked
Hand cock. Lol
LBCs James O'Brien will be wetting himself with excitement over this news. Bet he cant wait till 10am Monday to get stuck in.
I see nothing has been done to her ? Takes two to tango people
It’s was overdue
Top shagger
What a hypocrite scandal man. I really want covid19 to end but this clown messed it all up no one trusts the government now is gonna get worst and people won't follow the rules😡. Hasher rules must apply then and we who did the right thing have to suffer
Better country now ye haaaa
I don't care what he has done, it happens,  but why are we all now following the rules, when the government aren't we are the fools not him
It was not just a kiss... Ment to be running the country in a bad time instead. ... He's not kissing her, he's banging her.. Boris must of known ....??  Media not crucified him..??? Why is this acceptable . SMH
The failings of Boris Johnson to sack Matt Hancock from the beginning have finally opened the flood gates for the PM Boris Johnson to tender his resignation to the Queen with immediate affect! Dealing with the collosal of covid is one thing but dealing with the collosal level of hypocrisy stemming from Downing Street to boot is entirely another! The only reason why Matt Hancock had to resign was because he got caught in the act which begs the question many will wish to ask, how long has this been going on for?? To be fair Boris has just revealed a fatal weakness in his leadership skills as PM so with that being said it's suffice to say that it's time for Boris to go now, enough is enough and that's putting it rather bluntly!
So now we get seedless Jaffa May as well have appointed Up and coming Tory mp  Tommy tugs his hat Their all W###### anyway.
Bloody Idiot
He such a devious little weasel! 😂🙄 I wonder how many more times he has broke his own rules🧐
oh dear....so we have lost the slogan...... HANDS FACE,BACK TO MY PLACE......
Good f@#%&€g riddance
🤣😂England England England 😂 Matt is a legend yeah 😂🥳🇿🇦
Jacob Rees mogg  please be our prime minister
No ..he got offered a new post with the economic world forum..
This news is designed to blind us to what is approaching us all, an at alarming speed. Brace yourselves.
They're a law unto themselves the Tories. Come next election these fools will still be in power because people are dumb enough to continue to vote for them
It's wrong he was snooped on and snitched, I don't like cctv much myself it's there for safy issues mostly, its just being used for condemnation,if it happened to me I'd feel violated. The use of technology needs looking into. hell hole!
It’s all planned. He had to get out Cos ppl have woken up re the pandemic and this guy needed a quick exit
People need to look at this document and share ithttps://rumble.com/viww3n-leaked-docs-on-permament-lockdown-of-uk-in-3-weeks.html
How England still votes Tory is mind blowing to me
grow up everyone no one cares if he got sacked or not they all as bad as each other.
Anyone else would get a massive fine!! Double standards!! Goodbye u little weasel !!
🍿
Stop paying taxes everyone we are in a pandemic.  the government has his own issues They don't have time for the public
#BuildBackBetter What a pillock.
Obvious MI5 leak is obvious
#RulesForTheeNotForMe #ScrewYou
Government not telling me what i'm going to do my private life any more Only thing as happened to Matt Hancock  he as  been put at the back of the class  for being a naughty boy .,it's wrong when    people had to have online funerals for  there loved one
He does not have moral authority to continue talking about the said pandemic. Well gone
he's glad to be out
Now that they have a person of colour in this position, it may be easier to get minorities on board with the jabs and lockdowns.
On the good side, it gives him time to prepare his defence for the Charge of ‘Crimes Against Humanity’. Prepare for Nuremberg 2!!!!
Everyone resigning to go hide
She is is married to a multi-millionaire fashion tycoon husband Oliver Tress, and she chose Handoncock!!!! 😂😂
NHS is NOT a gift. We pay for it.
This is all staged do not be fooled by what the media reports
Is not his fault,  was the Lady who didn't know how to keep her place.
Build up that strength on your arm ya cheating barstard.
He was right. Soo hard  working fella. And he tries to GRAB every single oppertunity
Hancock !!,  Mate not bad taste 😉☺️
I found him such a smug d..k head always happy with doom and gloom covid news to deliver never sincerely put to public.
This is hilarious.....   https://youtu.be/NsyQ2Q3QMAw
The question NOBODY is asking here is , how did someone get into his office and ( hide ) a camera in a (smoke detector)  , that has real security implications …. How many other cameras have been hidden .
An adulterer has fallen
He needs to move on to his banking job so he can pay for his new wallpaper.
Matt Hancock should be prosecuted just like all that have breached social distancing and should step down from politics
Here in France he would have got a medal ,,jeez after all the headaches this guys had over the last year , surely he can be allowed a ( choose my words carefully ) a lighthearted moment ,
He’s replaced by another puppet & coconut Sajid Javed
Poor guy, his only human at the end of the day like everyone else!
Anyways what will go down with Sajid? That’s the big question
The whole lot should resign including SAGE.
Bruh he resigns cuz he knows the media will get annoyed about it then get angry so then it will lead to consequences which will make him sack him so he made himself the ‘good guy’ by resigning. Done. 📝 📱 😡 🧳 🏡
Sacked for using track n trace on Gina Carbonaras tonsils!
Manslaughter charges next.
Shouldn’t his boss take some responsibility.
He cheat on his wife ,that's what he did
Should of gone long ago pub landlord getting PPE contact more crooked than a £9 note
Folk digested and believed in the non consented isolation  measures, lock stock and barrel. Healthy 2nd helpings for many in the Government while he told  everyone don't travel to see your partner while he had two ... No Hugs No Cwtching lol 😆
Maybe we should concentrate on getting out of this pandemic rather than people personal lives and blaming 🙄 people. Every day people are dishonest and have affairs   make bad decisions and blunder. Everyone thinks they can do a better job, but reality is our people have done the best they can in the situation.
Priti Patel and dementia Joe still letting in migrants by the lorry load.  When are they going to resign?
It was all planned
what a lier !
Calm it folks, there is science behind this...  Reports are coming in from around the world of what is rapidly becoming known as the Westminster Variant. Patient zero has been identified and it is believed to be a transmission of the covid 19 (Delta) variant from a rodent (sewer rat) to an MP"s Aid.  The Prime Minister has announced that he fully supports the medical advice to quarantine the rodent and all individuals that came into contact with patient Zero in a small area in Cuba especially set up for dangerous pathogens.  Said isolation will be indefinite until the variant is brought under control and the danger to the general public  and the NHS is avoided.  The new variant will be designated 'Handjob-69' as it's the first transmission identified that conflicts with the government covid-19 guidelines of  ✋ face and space.   The new variant is known to cause spontaneous acts of a sexual nature and  is gender neutral adding a further complexity to containment within the Westminster area.  The England health authority announced rapid test and isolation to commence from Monday 28th June. With Westminster being moved to defcom 9.  The general public is advised to avoid all non essential contact.
This isn’t over the worse is yet to come. In the months and years to come we’ll see the effects of the JAB in people ⚠️⚠️
Covid Fraudsters. There’s one rule for us whilst their living it up! They know this plandemic is a fraud.
Why doesn't anyone seem to be concerned a voyeur has leaked a private moment?  They lock people up for that.
All a distraction, the kiss was staged and theirs plenty more skeletons in the closet
What did he do to break Covid rules ? No longer then 8 words...thanks
This was staged to get sajid javid  in.  That way BAME people will be more likely to get the jab
She needs to be made an example of.. leadership starts from the top.
He’s such a fool! Who wouldn’t think CCTV isn’t in an elevator- dummy he’s embarrassed his family and ruined his reputation. And just for some sex and attention from a aide and basically a fan. Idiot
Good luck getting back to your wife
Nah he's resigned coz his wife probably doesn't want him near his secretary again! Gave him the ultimatum 🙃😅
Waking up on a Sunday thinking I've made some bad decisions, it's comforting to think, at least I'm not Matt Hancock
Back in January he was informed by one of the top drug meta analysis firms in the UK that ivermectin could save over 75% of the lives being lost & he decided vaccine profits were more important than old people's lives. Resign? He should be up on charges of mass corporate manslaughter & murder.
Plandemic...
WHY just him? Both of them should have got Sacked and Heavily fined for there disgraceful act.
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL !!.........AT LONG LAST .......NOW BORIS !!!!!!
Good luck, Matt ✊🤜🤛
He got caught hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣and got caught well hahaaaaa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Goodbye sc*mbag
Lock him up for crimes against humanity
He literally reminds me of every weasel type character played in films and sitcoms.
good

I can't see there is any reason for Hancock to resign. He has done nothing that Boris Johnson has not been equally guilty of and yet Boris Johnson is frequently lauded and celebrated by the right wing media. I feel sorry for Hancock. He is little more than a scapegoat. Perhaps one day he will return as Prime Minister. I agree that Johnson has lowered the bar for that qualification drastically but one should be realistic. Johnson himself has proved that being "totally f****** hopeless" is no bar to winning the ultimate political seat of power in the land.
Is this a form of selective pressure?
Weasel
Why didn't Sky News give the same blanket coverage when Kay Burley broke the rules?? Before most where offered a vaccination???
If the lady is pretty I can understand.
What's all the fuss about?  He was just doing what most guys do...  getting a bit on the side to help keep his interest at work.  We all  need a little "pick me up" to brighten up our day.  If anything, my  opinion of him has gone up.  Go on, my son!

How can he employed a woman as his aide . I don’t think he know the meaning of aide . Just like Mr. Alan Johnson employed a male bodyguard to protect his wife and the bodyguard had an affairs with his wife .
What a right tit left tit and a lot of arse.all to take ya eyes off the real data that came out the same day.the biggest march london has ever seen.do the corrupt media cover that nope
Hancock was the fall guy for the elites in the pandemic.
Ok so someone who has told us that it is safer to keep a distance between us all has been having an affair has helped us belive that social distancing is all bullsh8t and that everything we have been told is all bullshit. Noone will believer the government now
Is he going to be held accountable?
This is expected of government officials and this is their morals
Every party in the country is full of wild dogs , professionism in England is a joke , what a message for our youngsters  , at least he wasn't on Clapham Common suckin off 2 rasta   gentlemen .......says Steve davidson lol
Bring out the scarlet letter regardless of gender.
Dam, no luck, I got caught! That's all he had to say.
Lol. Slime and filth, all the press, all the media, all big tech. A true swamp.
He is a fuckin joke
Matt Hancock should be prosecuted, and stand trial for giving tax payers money to his friends.
YouTube deleting comments they don't like. 😂👍
Who is the slimy geezer in the blue suit?
Mr Hancock was a dictator and the public became d#ck-takers. Oh hug your loves ones from the 15th of may 😂. While his c#cky was spreading the delta variant. Matt Handcock really domesticated the nation like dogs stay unvaccinated. I never did look up to him or government. But atleast give him credit for the vaccine roll out. I wouldn't be mad at him he has to release stress.
Led the world in the vaccination effort??? And in the deaths per capita. Lol. Piece of sh*t
Does Matt Hancock understand how much of a pathetic joke he is in the eyes of the public?? Build back better??? He should be investigated for mis appropriation of public money, in various cases, and jailed.
Case closed, said the Prime Minister. Who gave OUR money to the last bird he was caught shagging. The fat blonde yank.
Let's put Boris Johnson in prison for giving his American tart public funds?
https://youtu.be/UIsRrZYRHvE
Hahaha, what a joke. All of it. The prime minister, the press, the BBC, the pandemic, rules for us, not them. Whispering Joe Biden. All of it. A bad sad joke. We can't find better leaders than this shower??? Unbelievable.
Good riddance
Best news this year
Off to spend the public money he has stolen. How did that camera get there, do we even know?
this is soo humiliating for his wife, im sure she was briefed before u spoke about her situation like this
Hancock Gottadanglelow
Still a politician with his hand in his c......k!!!
Exactly, this is what Boris , Matt hancock and many others had done. Piers didn't succeed , bitter ever since.
I think Boris sent that picture out to the media so he doesn't have to show up at work and see the guy who he called "totally f****** hopeless" everyday
To be honest, in view of how much we needed him at this time,  I don’t think he should have gone,  after all,  we are dealing with the most corrupt and dishonest Prime Minister and Government ever – and so what different would it make.  I can think of others who haven’t gone who should have;  Priti Patel for one, and so many others have broken the rules anyway,  including Johnson himself, Cummings etc. The only blessing is that we didn’t get Gove as replacement!
He needs to be sacked so he loses his wages as now he is still being paid as an MP, disgraceful
Creepy hypocrites!
The Tories thought they could brazen this out like every prior event but it appears there is an awakening of the electorate. Perhaps the Brexit reality is sinking in along with all the corruption evident over the last two years.
part of game, to win next election season, the big question is still pending who released the kissing video 😅
This is becoming boringly familiar. Just more typical behaviour of mp's abusing their position and disobeying their own rules, including the rules of fidelity.
Good riddance to the filth.
The nation did not give itself the NHS the Atlee Labour government did against immense opposition from the Tories and Churchill himself. They already had good health care saw no reason why the plebs should get the same.
Let's throw Hancock under the bus to distract people from things that are harmful to our campaign..... I.E. Ivermectin and the freedom rally in London. I hope this wakes everyone up once and for all.
Good riddance to the lying cheating weasel
Sounds like more bullshit variant African japan Swansea
Sorry.. He’s a total disgrace. The law might catch up with him, eventually, but I won’t hold my breath!
Slime ball had us all locked up so he can carry on with the mistress. Cummings probably released the photo.
Oh dear.. back to more tha 80 grand plus expenses Per Annum .. How sad. How will he ever survive?
Boris was put in place for one thing only .. Brexit. Now it’s been done he’ll be ditched. His cabinet have made their millions. The next party leader, probably Rishi, will appoint a new team and the misappropriation of public funds will continue, but with new thieves. After all, they’re Tories. That’s what they do. Labour MPs are just as bad as the Lib Dem’s can only dream of fleecing the exchequer if only they could. Every bloody one of the is corrupt... And don’t start me on the Lords!
Guy live at Westminster, 🤘🤘🤘🤣🤣😊😊😊😊😊. He knows lol!
All a distraction  https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/06/26/whilst-youve-been-distracted-by-hancocks-affair-phe-released-a-report-revealing-62-of-alleged-covid-deaths-are-people-whove-been-vaccinated/
The lot of them should be gone,
Good riden 😑 he can take with him Bojo 😆 on his way. Let  Labour take charge 😑 Starmer for prime minister ✌
If the national health secretary is clearly not worried about social distancing then maybe all the highly qualified health experts who have been warning us CoViD is over, and that the PCR test is producing up to 90 % false positives anyway, and not even suitable to assess if a person even has a viral infection (coming from the inventor himself) were right all along. Consider  : Kary Mullis, inventor of the PCR, Nobel prize Winner https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXm9kAhNj-4 Mike Yeadon- ex VP of Pfizer vaccine Division https://www.bitchute.com/video/vkgb7snFGRAd/  OR https://www.bitchute.com/video/ijJcNUchkFxZ/ Dr. Simone Gold MD, JD - https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/legal_team/simonegold/
easy out for him....bigger things were coming
My contribution on LBC Radio regarding the lifting of the Covid restrictions and why Matt Hancock should not resign. Link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=51BzMA8QeKU
Her
Shaged
He
Elon probably posting the best tweet of his life tomorrow to get cryptos back up. The dip is just an opportunity to get more cryptos
He should be fined as well.
Boombom welcome to my room 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HE HAS COMPLETED HIS PART OF THE PLANDEMIC AND AGENDA!  ALMOST HIT THE QUOTA FOR POISON INJECTED!!!  DON'T WORRY, ITS A WELL ORGANISED PLAN..!
Smug and nasty individual :
LIES  IT'S ALL A  BIG MISDIRECTION.. DON'T BELIEVE THIS.. HE IS GETTING  A LARGE PAY CHEQUE..
The rules were made for (The Great Unwashed) not for our betters. I bet he won't get a fine.
how long before he is charged with corporate manslaughter i wonder...
Looks like Clarence boddiker
The next will come...sorry..no covid easing...wait to see. I believe it.s a planned exit,and the new health minister will delay the easing till next year...he said too many lies already..the next one should tell his stories..about covid19
Man said build back better.
Yeah let’s see how this new goon handles the pressure of an incompetent conservative government
Not good enough, should have been fired.Wait to see the moron that will replace him.
This man is a hero, who has been leading nation through the corona virus crisis. This is so unfair that he should resign. This was his personal life and it had  nothing to do with social distancing. Millions of people now, everywhere in England do not follow any corona safety rules, just look around. Why such an aggression against this man from so many people?
Now lets investigate his finances and see how much public money stuck to his filthy little fingers......I lay money that will never happen.
What a LAD!
How does him having an affair affect him doing his job? Ludicrous, if he wants to sleep around so what.
Matt Hancock ends with "Build Back Better"  the slogan of Death & Destruction from the Deep State & world Globalist  Take warning!
Should of resigned from politics as MP too. We need to drain the swamp of those in Parliment that break rules. Only resigned because he has been caught. Boris should of sacked him way before he resigned.
He's trying so hard not to laugh I'm howling😂😂😂😂😂
Oh my god. A tory MP caught with his pants down. Cant believe  that.
F.ING made my day " 1st Domino DOWN " now for the rest of the BARSTEWARDS
there all worse than us
Hancock will be in Barbados by the end of the month
Should be looking forward to supporting his family... and nothing else... silly man! Filthy Politics!
Mugs take vaccine  People question
The Demon has blood on his hands. KARMA has come for him and will be merciless.
Why are Westminster speaking so highly of a man, that has broken his family, broken the rules he's made, and upset the general public? Why panda to a man that has resigned?
Tosser
top shagger
I will sleep better tonight because he was one of the 6UILD 6ACK 6ETTER GANG Don't forget to read the official Covid Data. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996740/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_17.pdf
Two ppl kiss, and England goes into meltdown. Grow up!!
I look forward to the SNP apologies IE George Square . Leicester Square! Speaking to young people who were abused.
Great, good byes with blessings 🙏🏿☮️
The real scandal is the transparent phoniness of his stated reasons for resigning.  The empty recitals of post hoc fealty to social distancing rules - it's really too much to bear.  It really requires super-human self-control to put on a performance of insincerity like this with a straight face.
Hope Boris is next. There all dodgy.
He’s a muppet anyway making us follow rules while he’s not absolute mug glad he resigned big forehead Tramp
Best news of the year
Report real news! Sky Australia know Celtic have brought a nobody to take the flak for the court cases coming up!!!
‘No longer helpful’ babe when was his cocky input ever helpful in government
I can vomit now ,,, lies and repeat
Good about time. Useless and all ways has been.
Sincerity  is not his strongest piont.  He`s a better lier than a MP
Well he should change his name to naughty Jack hahha - he could do with a new wig just like Boris has
We're all being manipulated by dark forces. Next will be the phasing out of physical money and the  introduction of digital cash.
he is so full of **** its fantasy......50 shades of tory government?
It’s a complete farce!! Shame on him, pure hypocrisy... what goes around.
Wonder if Cummings was behind this leak to the Sun of cctv ? They obviously don’t like each other  Cummings is proving a dangerous enemy
Yep he’s resigning because he broke his own rules and wants to do the right thing, last week he wasn’t bothered and was fine with deceiving the public
It's all part of the program. Another will do even worse than him. We live in a world of fake people.
not worth the energy
Smoke screen
Next video:  All the population that has broken the rules. Better book a year off, it's going to be a long video.
Gina is looking for a job!
Kay Burley did worse .....
Is Gina shopping around for another job?
According to other interviews, he actually met with Boris. More lies.😎
Hancock, forked tongue?
Build back better? Where have I heard that🤔
If only we all had penises and vaginas on our elbows...
This is the first time the like and dislike ratio is decent
Haha he had no choice but to resign and he should have been fired.
这么丑的女人，还抱亲，丑死了
So we are meant to listen to these muppets and get our vaccines like good little boys and girls while they go around doing as they please and break their "guidelines". Give me a break
Yo Sky.. what's the latest with Prince Andrew the fiddler? Most pedos are charged, jailed and released by now. MSM forgot about this HUGE story. A prince a possible pedo is surely worth keeping up with no?
no doubt he will walk into another lucrative job and knowing our muppet run government he will get a big payoff and keep his very generous pension  our government is a complete joke how many more like him cannot keep it inside his trousers
If only Sky News presenters had as much dignity and resigned after breaking Covid rules. Kay Burley????
Waiting for Boris to resign he has had his  fun at being PM he also is ' absolutely hopeless ' .
Oh wake up why has that letter been made public ..people are still being played . ..by these emotionally inept people. #exitbanks
Dickhesd Hancock should never be allowed to be a MP ever again as he'll end up screwing his voters as well
another overpaid muppet bites the bullet how many more in our government cannot keep it inside there trousers
My feelings right now are with the people who have been hurt here including the public .....
no doubt he will get a good payout and keeps his very generous pension benifits
He can bow to the queen now
Still should have sacked Kay and Morticia..eh sky UK
We all have to trust the examples we are asked to follow ....leading by example is paramount !!
Rules for thee but not for me - pandemic handling in a nutshell
This was planned !! He couldn’t of resigned for how s**t he is and how he has no idea what he has been doing !he defo told his bird listen I’m Going to snog a bird where cctv is ,create a scandal, then I can resign for that !
She's ugly  Is he married ?  I'm sure many have done worse  He was forced to resign.. This is an infringement on his privesey.. it's not a crime
labour are the joke
Cover up story the wife is in on it and they will now fade out of public view with secret millions
This is so stupid. With a hug and kiss like that, he is definitely sleeping with her. Why, then should he resign? She is his bed mate. Do they now have a social distance expectation for people who are that close behind closed doors? Madness.
The man is crook incompetent and he was backed by his mate who also he don't have a clue how to run the NO. 10. The whole lot are bunch of useless but they get away with murder daily
Self destruction! 🙄🙄🙄
Replaced by another identikit psychopath.
HEARTLESS MAN - MANY PEOPLE DIED AND THEY JUST LAUNCHED AT PRESS TALKS. Now resigning because of a fishy affair? Who in their right mind will flaunt private affairs in a public place as he did? If he is nuts, why didn't the lover stopped him? She seemed to have enjoyed the public kiss too and looks like a clandestine affair that has gone on for a while. She ought to go too, appointed by Matt or not. This is public money and ministerial appointment. What else is new in this government.
Bet he is a double jabber
this government is nothing but a rich boys club i dont know who voted for them boris should resign as well as he picked all the dirty little pricks in the first place
Thank god. I bet sky is devastated at having to report actual news.
"Resigning"  *BECAUSE* I've been sussed. .....didn't think of resigning when with his squeeze.
Remove your mask. Lockdown Kills
Excuse me..he needs to be punished..and a full investigation made about his contracts and fortunes he and his family made from people's money
So funny
MATT WAS BREACHING HER TOO I BET LOL
He’s served his purpose, the tory bstards will be lorded in Murdochs comic books as having integrity.  What a shower of c….
NOTHING BUT A DISTRACTION
Expect he will get a knighthood for services to women...
He was planning I'd bracelets with G5 PHONES TO TTRACK TRACE ALL UR MED NEEDS TO USE AGAINST U... IN OR OUT OF UK TO ANY NATIONS
Usa told us a week ago handcock would be put up as scarfical lamb of slaughter.... Oh bless his bleeding heart haemorrhaging from one blood eye of the freemason cult....ull bet Bojo will have hc Wife will get dipomatic immunity
Absolute fantastic news.. the sleazy smug hypocrite deserves everything he gets and more!! The most hated man in in England adios
Disgusting.
Only days ago Bojo met Queen here remarks are recorded as poor man poor  Mr Hancock she knew what was coming days ago... He's summons for criminal justice his wife  probable divorce will be watch to see if she claims his fraud money not wanting to down with him WAKE UP... SMOKE MIRRORS... BOJO KNEW HE WAS BECOMING A VOICE LIABILITY.. CAUGHT OUT MANY MANY TIMES... HE KISSED A WOMAN THAT COULD OF BEEN ASYMPTOMATIC.    DONT HEAR HERE SCREAMIMG OFFICE SEX HARASSMENT DO WE... DONT BELIEVE ONE MINUTE HE'S RIGHT UNDER CCTV Cameras slease...
He can retrain as a traffic warden!
Good riddance. Corrupt, dishonest, shameless snake
Hmmmm shouldn't he be fined like we were?
Curb your social distancing
A low life adulterous scheming lying hoaxer has bit the dust. He caused nothing but damage to the u.k. the arrogant POS.
He is only honest when he got caught  😂😂😂😂
He’s done his job and jabbed those who are prepared to take it, let’s hope that those jabbed don’t react badly to seasonal flu.
These globalist pri**s are all going down!
The public should be angry with the Labour party. Any half-decent opposition party would have won the last election. Instead, people voted for the Conservatives because the thought of Labour being in power was too frightening to contemplate.
WHY... I WOULD NOT,.. PUBLIC ARE WASTERS.
Just as bad as Hancock's behaviour is the fact that Boris said he considered the matter closed before he resigned. Johnson has no morals and is not fit to hold public office.
Resigned to get out of being hanged for treason against the people?  Are we going to accept this, the man trying to get away with genocide!  Covid-19 it says on the label of the little jar because that's what is inside.. the PCR isn't a test they're putting things on your blood brain barrier.
that smirk has dropped now
Peter Parker to Matt Hancock "gonna cry?"
Zombie apocalypse incoming!  “IT’S A BIOWEAPON,” says Dr.. Richard Fleming referring to the virus and the genome of the virus. Dr. Fleming also asserts that new research indicates that the genetic sequences that are in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not match the alleged source code CoV-2 virus genome, but are spot on with the prion-like domain region which produces what the general public refers to as mad cow disease.

He would of carried on lying to the country if he hadn't been caught out, and that was the fakest apology I've ever seen. He should face criminal charges after all he did introduce a 10 year prison sentence for braking covid rules.. Next to go will be Boris
He is sorry only because he got caught😒
I just wonder what kind of job will he get?? I bet he still needs to pay the bills.
ordinary ppl barely can bag groceries at tesco... amazing role out and handling of the pandemic.. we need to thank god to have men to sort out our problems rather than cry in the comment section because we want to direct our frustration from our own life at every chance we get.. pathetic!!!
Another publicity stunt to avoid the inevitable questions he's achieved his goal with all his cronies. And run like a rat in a trap.
From now on we will watch every move MP's  make.  they tell us how to live our lives while they do what they like.
Now we know why he's always had a smirk on his face.
i can see that the news reporter ( Rob westminster) is dying to LAUGH!! #LMFAOOO!! let it out boy. let it out !! 🤣

He should be in prison, he has made a mockery out of the people of Britain who have sacrificed so much since march 2020. They're meant to be our leaders and they acted like that, it's embarrassing.
Boris standing up for the pillock instantly without taking stock of what had happened has a greasy feel to it, too. Why didn't he stand Hancock down until he'd found out more and gauged the feeling in the country? Instead he just says, 'it's forgiven, case closed' then real life intrudes on the Westminster bubble.
Rupert Murdoch is quite amazing!! Love him or Hate him, all credit to him~
Bu-bye now!
No news boys he is not coming back in power....  the people don't like the political games anymore...
shut up Matty
Oh f@ck off! Matt Hancock resigned because of what he feels. Give us a beak!
This is all planned,. See how he just said Build back better ,. Look into it,.
He should be on television. "Hancocks Half Hour"
One corrupt UKgov minister gone, just the rest of the criminal party to get rid of now
The best thing for ENGLAND,  SCOTLAND, WALES and NORTHERN  IRELAND ! !!
And what IF the camera had not caught him , would he be feeling sorry for anyone or anything ! ?
HE WAS RUBBISH. PROBABLY THE WORST HEALTH SECRETARY EVER !
Boris is getting another job wait  and see in August....
bet he'll go home and absolutely pipe her now he's out of public eyes lol
As an adulterer just carrying on a British tradition.  As regards his apology we already know Politicians make false promises they know they cannot keep.  This is Good News.
this so embarassing..
👏👏👏 I said that he would have been gone by 6.00 and as by magic, he needed to go from long time but it wasn't  the shambling of the pandemic but he's lying and cheating...Good riddance no need to hear his pathetic words disgrace
Enough is enough. Its time for a vote of NO-CONFIDENCE in this government. How many more in the "WOODPILE" ?
Breaking news :this is BS
Yes glad he’s gone but 1he didn’t resign straight away so he couldn’t see he did wrong or he just so pompous that again one rule for him etc...2he set the parameters so he should know remember him drinking in the bar....3do all the contracts he signed giving jobs to family friends ,his bitches relatives,the pub landlord come under consideration.....4so when he was standing on the podium feeling sincere his words he was lying through his teeth
Er and erm Matt er, Hancock, erm, er has, er, resigned.
its a shame that Matt Hancock had to resign over this. The culture of demanding capble persons to resign over minor indiscretions is vindictive and damaging to the country.
This is why other leaders will think million times about repercussions upon breaching the guidance set out by their own office.
Well all I can say I feel sorry for his wife what a show up for her as he can go off with his new. Love well all can say good luck to him
A total asshole amongst other assholes who must pay for what they have done to this country so that it never ever happens again.
Good riddance lying HYPOCRITICAL creep. We will not rest until this whole covid lie is exposed for the lie that it is.
DNA his fingers, am sure it's gone into many No.10 F.puddings...
i'm glad hes done immediate apology and resigned, fancy making your family a joke now though
bORIS CALLED HIM HOPELESS now he's the best thing since sliced bread..... I give up!
how DO They get these jobs?, oh yes ...by mates,of course!   when over 100K are dead, hes got time to be messing around with close colleague? pathetic and her too... all as bad as each other, how the tories still get votes I really dont know, never voted labour but wont be conservative ever again, such a bunch of hypocrites
All that...  And I would not describe her as "attractive"
How many others are having affairs? Has the other party involved resigned too?
His name says the truth. Ha ha ha ha ha 🤣🤣🤣 My goodness.
For fcuks sake
Good riddance.  Now the rest of the government must go as well!
He sacraviced his lip's.
Roland rat,s is taking matt hankock, s place.
Wow! I just heard a Nation cry out a whopping "HOORAY!"
It's always womens,  isn't it 🙄
My heart bleeds for Matt Hancock - Not!   It bleeds for 50,000+ needless covid deaths because of this goverment's mismanagement of the pandemic.
Please help me to find Boris balls...
When the goats is down the knifes get more !jealousy and hypocrisy
"FUNNY down by FANNY" after becoming Covid-19 millionaire
tory voters must be proud.
Can’t stand Matt handoncock
Is England free from Europe? I don't think so...
He should not have resigned why??  The man did his best and was told what was to be said and done! Non of anybody's business with his private life on what he does
Once again has to use the NHS as a scapegoat
Breaking news - massive freedom protest in London today.
GOOD RIDDANCE..........now we don’t have to listen to his lying BS anymore. But....we won’t forget!!!!!
Coward
Should have been sacked ... dirty dodger.
Now Boris needs to resign
So he should it’s a mockery to all those folks that were fined n the moneys he’s on our hard earned wages
That photo on the front page of the Sun isn't his aide at all. It's Ann Widdecombe.
This is planned by the deep state, move him out before the real damage and deaths start!!
Some good news.
WHY WHAT TEH HELL
Throwing in the key phrase there. Build Back Better.
Apology not accepted. Enjoy your karma Matthew
I feel sorry for his poor wife, that dirty mare he's snogging should also get the sack, breaking the rules of work ethics.
Anyone else think the News anchor looks smug
But He's Still There he should be *GONE*  PERIOD. Like when his predecessor's were found to have had  Sexual Improprieties with the Staff. 🇮🇪🇪🇺
Strictly come dancing it is then…..
Still spouting the build back better satanist crap
He must be investigated before his resignation is accepted
The more he dragged out resigning, the more of that video they were going to release.
The media and Hancock are trying to spin this as a matter of breaching social distancing. The truth is Hancock broke the ministerial code - it's more than just an affair, the corruption is deep. He appointed this lady to a paid position in the department of Health whilst he was shagging her, and it turns out he was handing contracts to her brother. This is only what we know publicly, let alone what is being hidden from the public.
All theatre. All a distraction  ..the latest official figures are not looking good for deaths owing to taking the injectable.
Staged false affair to have a reason to resign... it’s clear as day
ok he has resigned . . but he will still be employed by the government . . BECAUSE , , the higher people cant be sacked . . he will get another job within the government . . we wont see him stacking shelves anytime soon!!! because the HIGHERS ( the scumbags) protect themselves regardless how much damage is done!! like he said he will support the government FROM THE BACK BENCHES . . HENCE BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET!!! PARLIMENT IS SOOOOOOO CORRUPT!!!
Him resigning is part of the long script the fcuking terrorist have in place,it’s all bull.
Sky news your a disgrace! No mention about the hundreds of thousands in the capital!.?
Breaking social distancing rules, hilarious, wonder how his family describes it.
This is his legacy. 🤣
I made my profit and i am out
The video footage was the nail in his coffin, he should resign as an MP, no one can ever trust this man ever again
Can't believe he still slipped in "6uild 6ack 6etter' at the end! Absolute brainwashed puppet. These puppets carrying out the instructions from their overlords are just like automatons.
Why are people on Twitter saying Matt Hancock did a good job? What exactly did he do that was such a good job? Nothing.. he was a useless waste of space
I’m sorry to hear about Matt Hancock’s resignation. As a Health Secretary it is important to deliver the right message in this pandemic. I do think he has made a sensible decision. I wish him all the best.
Most hated person in the uk
Sorry sir 🙏 now stay home,stay safe 🙏
he is just human I forgive him...enjoy your life now.., too much pressure...
Replaced by another cloud cuckoo oxbridge bell-end, then repeat 👍🏿
Hancock is sorry that he was caught......
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING!!  BELIEVE AND REPENT FROM YOUR SINS🙏🙏 THE RAPTURE IS NEAR!!  DONT BE LEFT BEHIND!!!!
Imagine how he took the decisions for us as him made a contrary behaviour behind doors
Cienkapizda
@ Matt Hancock I am pressing charges ignorance is no excuse
Pekly rajtuzkiipocieklopi nogafka.NIE LEC DO TELABABU
The thumbnail violation 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mr Hancock resigned because he was caught out. He has not an ounce of genuine regret. Had this video not emerged he would, without doubt, have continued with his affair whilst preaching to the rest of us mere mortals. He is a vile, condescending and totally insincere individual who deserves everything he gets. The sad thing is he will probably be replaced with someone who is equally out of touch with reality.
Bro the thumbnail trim
Told to resign.  Johnson hasn't the moral authority to sack anyone.
Yiiiiiiiiipppppppppeeeeeeee
This is better than Netflix 🍿
Probably be put on a board of directors, sell his story to the highest bidder and laugh all the way to the bank. First class c**t

Oosh don't be kissing in ya bubble
We have seen these shitbags lording it over us for a long time. They should all resign.
God bless sky for enabling comments 🤣
I know why he has resigned
He can now spend the millions he’s squandered while we’ve all been locked up. Evil corrupt man 😡
N ailed. H is. S ecretary.
😎😁 JUDAS  TO THE BRITISH PUBLIC  JUDAS 😁😎
cos he knows hes been lying to us all why he all of Sudden hes Resigned
Good! Good riddance! Slimeball! He doesn’t care about the country, he only cares about himself!!
The sprout .......
All rats will resign soon.
the thing that will forever baffle me... how tf did Matt Hancock pull a woman in the first place
What a piece of filth personified. That's Matt Hancock. Overwhelmed NHS? Pandemic my arse. This country is a disgrace.
HORNEY HANDCOCK should have improved the mental health service in the UK which is almost non existent.... thanks.
He'll be back just like Ferguson. Hypocrisy.
Good riddance
Sigh...     Operation.
Stupid shame 🙄🙄🙄🙄 i
Relationships are breaking down because of their crap rules, and here he is having two.
Creepy trunks
Saw right through him the minute I set eyes on the snake, here in England nobody likes him and his shark eyes, build back better, my arse. Apparently a security bloke asked him to move and he answered him very nasty,so member of security leaked the footage
Murderer
there is something else going on here.....

He fell on his sword, I wish there was more like him.
People love to kill everyone around them.
He's broke the rules and committed adultery. And he expects to keep his job as an MP and back bencher. I'm sorry but for me that's gross misconduct and he should be ousted out of the commons full stop. Career as any kind of public figure over.
I red Matt handcock
just fukked my masks into the bin
I wouldn't be surprised if Cummings and a mate were somehow behind putting that camera up in Hancock's office.
At least he wasn't cruising young boys in homes...small mercies.
Good riddance, the guy is a complete and utterly disgrace. Firstly he Fu@#ed the Country then he cheated on his wife.
The whole thing was concocted. He needed a way to step aside without it looking like he was admitting to having screwed up on the Plandemic
Time for Rat Fauci.
What does that say about the other cabinet members who were defending him even as late as this morning?
👍😊
Hancock, didn't like the Governmental rules so  he staged an exit  card. 😂😎
Good riddance. Hopefully he doesn’t turn up in a plumb government job in 12 months from now when this is a distant memory. He’s not fit to hold office.
Don't give a toss about your private life, mate, it's your hypocrisy and double standards that I object to!
Should of been sacked,but government covers up for there own
He needs to be arrested
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Hancock
Big pay off Sweetener....doesn't need to work again. The Government is riddled with Corruption And us the taxpayers are paying for it.
Matt Hancock has been the enemy of the public. How much money he has made out of Covid. The public should be given the full details of any contracts handed out by him, given the green light by him or any he has been involved in, as it was public money used. I wonder if the person that takes his place is going to be any better for the public or much the same as him.
Always double standards 🙄. Cheers Government. Hippocrates!!!
Username doesn't check out
Definitely done on purpose 😁
Was planned event. Whole debacle was staged 100%.
Thank f***ing God!!!!! 🙌
He should have resigned because he cheated on his wife never mind covid rules. A matter of principles and morality that are lacking in today's politics. He should also be investigated for possible corruption. It says a lot about a society when its ok for a person in power to cheat on their spouse. If the person cheats on their spouse what are they going to be like with other people.
what a knobhead
Is she resigning too?
Wonder what the  Sunday papers would say about him tomorrow, may be they have more serious stuff on him, Would explain timing of his early resignation.
I wonder which other mp was secretly filmed?
Bunch of pricks
This is a miracle 😄👍💚
Good
Not a bad looking woman. Fill your boots lad.
He wants to laugh so bad 🤣🤣🤣
O dear digging this grave will be bigger by the day
He switches the story very quickly
Who reckons Gove wil step in to thw roll.
Resign all he wants he will still be tried for all the deaths in the care homes 🤷‍♂️🥰👋
He didn't just break the rules, he had an affair
Well, well, well there we have it!!!!!  Hancock, had to go!!!!  He was like Dominic Cummings said!!!  He laughed in the faces of those whom lost love ones.  There's rumours that his wife, Martha has allegedly Matt kicked out their house, don't know how true that is.  Not good.
The hypocrisy is unfathomable.
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYYYY
Massive PR stunt . Who ever believes this to be true can't smell the big fat ray.
Evil, lying, Satanic Freemason with no moral compass, murderer.
It's all been planned ppl!they already know who will replace him,they are laughing at us....those who have eyes can see its been 100% staged,everything..
W
This is why people hate politicians
Good I hope your boss the next
thanks for resigning handcock are wishes have come true
Oh I feel so happy inside 😂
Thank god and his mistress 🤣
Finished work to see this. Immediately cheered up 😂
Hi bravo good boy 🤗
Top shagger
There is a god now Boris Johnson and Chris Witty should resign next 👍👍👍
Now can we see him prosecuted for murder please? This was far too an easy way out. This man has blood on his hands.
Great! And now Professor Fergusson together with all of the other politicians and civil servants flouting their own draconian rules that they unlawfully forced on the public they need to resign too.
This party is an absolute joke,they swan around doing whatever they like and think they can get away with it,yes we all make mistakes in life but philandering and having an affair   is wrong,glad he resigned but should have been sacked before he announced his resignation.
At last! Should of been sacked though.
Now for the ring master
Don't know what's worse, Hancock resigning OR Sajid Javid taking the role !!! FFS we are doomed any which way but loose !
How com his wife is silenced?  ??
All part of their get out of jail free card for all these traitors
Hancock will always be a prisoner
Now for the ring master
This is the man people have trusted with their health & their lives. "Have the maxine" he said. He lied to his own family, anyone who listens to a word he says and thinks he wouldn't lie to the Public are very naive.
what a load of bo.....s
Yeah i understand its very hard not to fucksome one during a pandemic
!!!!! WHAT A SOAP OPERA !!!!!!!!!! WHAT A SOAP OPERA !!!!!!!!!! WHAT A SOAP OPERA !!!!!
Sneaky shitweasel
What's his notice period?
investigate His bank accounts and All his  familys Bank Accounts  to see how much tax payer money he has stolen !
best news ever
As much as the COVID rules were breached at that level both of them have breached security rules and cannot be trusted.
Fk u abide by rules 😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹 there's no rules anymore and England is free to do what they like .. fuk u Boris fk u Hancock fk u tories ..its over now
What...He says that the NHS wasn't overwhelmed? It's overwhelmed every winter due to lack of beds,A and E's have been closed and ICU capacity has been halved. Corridors are overwhelmed with patients needing beds. Jeremy Hunt helped destroy the NHS....Well done,will we ever get a competent health secretary?
At last, what an idiot, should have gone ages ago. Bye and good riddance! Of course there is pressure.
Get the party poppers out and popcorn too best news so far 😂 👏🏽
BECAUSE OF THAT PIECE OF FLESH,HE COMPROMISE HIS CAREER,POOR MAN.
Surely if he's had to go, so does his girlfriend.
Just got 12 hours goolag for expressing my distain for hancocks actions on twitter. What a baby. I didn't call him names or swear.
Hancocks gone 👹 his replacement ☞ 👹
This creep makes my skin crawl, lying to the bitter end.
Whoever spied with covert camera had to be working there with, at least, baseline security clearance. Espionage by left wing civil servant, undercover operative posing as cleaner or maintenance?
thank god
right honourable??  I think they need to change that with ministers like this
Which 'tard is going to replace him? Another pharmaceutical sycophant no doubt, funny how it took an affair and not all his crimes.
Lots of ums and errs is he really a professional newsreader ?
Borris should be next for trying to brush it under the carpet.
She was on the verge of passing out so he just supported her and was giving her mouth to mouth. Why is that so difficult to understand. Just like the media telling us that the dozens of Buden’s gaffes are just him in a playful mode.
Good riddance
Boris would not think he had done wrong , as he has been a serial cheater.
Kick rocks.
Snivelling piece of sh*t should have gone months ago.
At least he won't lose his pension by resigning
Does anyone really believe that this idiot is clever enough to cover up an affair?!.
Seems YouTube  stopping truthful posts here
Convenient exit.
Back Bench from where SACK HIM
He's finished robbing the country. Now someone else's turn
Thank f ck now get the rest of our sycophath puppets  removed
How convenient what about the lost 500 000 Corona test results  why is no one speaking about that
get sheep head out next
The slippery fish is caught...
If anyone is feeling helpless just remember they need us to obey to keep the lie going, we outnumber them by millions, we have the power,   they will pull out every trick to get us in line, all we have to do is say no
Build back better = state control by unelected leaders / the culling of human life with that snake oil they are pushing on us.
Good riddance and don’t come back.
don't like the guy particularly, but its his private life. Cast the first stone and all that....
Boris next
Well done to a man who has respect for the Ministerial Code unlike his companions. I hope the press leave him to patch with his family.
A sky news video with more likes than dislikes what a novelty
Hypocrites…so many of them should resign.
They all need to go
And as they watch Hand-cock's pathetic twitter message an entire Nation has to fight the urge too stand up and punch the TV.
Time to party 🎉
Its worth remembering that he did apologise, so its all good
Did he just say the NHS is the best present a country has ever given its self?? After stealing 37bilion (yes billion with a B) for his and Boris friends.....
Done the damage now he runs . Coward
Can we make a national holiday out of this? Wouldn't say no to a bank holiday to celebrate
Well 🤔😏..... What else could he have done?  hard to hold on to his position when his true character has been revealed in such a spectacular way. Sad. 😒
he broke the law plain and simple... or is he above it?
Just wait for a book called ( me and Hancock)
Theatre
😂😂😂😂
It changes nothing in this grand charade, but if it means we see a bit less of him for a while, we'll take that. Let's not forget to talk about where the midazolam went.
Amazing news
Wonderful
I do not understand why the media keep repeating the inaccuracies/lies of our government like parrots instead of fact-checking and challenging them:  - the NHS has been overwhelmed. The UK has 2x less hospital beds per 100 000 inhabitants than France and 4x less than Germany. The fact that the UK had the highest number of death and death rate in the whole of Europe and the whole world for a while (for countries of similar population sizes) simply shows that the NHS has been overwhelmed. 🤷🏻‍♂️  - Handcock’s ministry did not exactly have to “deal with the unknown”. Italy, France, Spain and China had been dealing with COVID for 2 to 3 months when it hit the UK, to the point that our government had a 3 week to a month head start before it had to face the pandemic. It was also warned by the international and other european scientific communities. They just chose to look down on the issue, the countries affected, and ignore for too long the restrictions required to actually deal with it, and that is why we were hit badly. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Real question should be: which foreign spy agency planted the hidden camera in Matt Hancock's office, how many other of our Ministers do they have dirt on, and who will they blackmail next?
Shame he didn’t resign for the monumental f*ck up in the way he has handled the pandemic! Again…….diversion tactics! Now he has resigned he is untouchable and unaccountable for his actions over the last 18 months!!!!
Hope he washed his hands
What a load of bollocks from him !
Bye bye EMPOSTER WE CERTAINLY WONT MEET AGAIN LIER TILL THE END LO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s all a farce. A lie. A circus.
All smoke screens & mirrors!!
What a fraud! Not surprised, I always believed he was full of shizzle. Who next?
Well done! There will be more of them resigning soon...
It's all Hollywood folks.....
Absolutely beautiful news ‼️‼️
Wounded he has no idea what wounded feels like.. he has enough money millions.. what about the the real wounded..
Surely the dumb propaganda spewing media have noticed the change to like/dislike ratio from their usual fear mongering
By the time the general masses have had enough of the scamdemic/grest rest agenda.. none of the people who played a hand in it will be in their roles and the new tyrants will say 'blame the last guy'  PCR tests exposed https://youtu.be/dB9OOVPCXEc
What a legend
Be another tyrant to take his place as quick as he is gone
Eat out, help out         -Matt Hancock 2020
and so history repeats - remember john major and back to basics while he was cheating on his wife?  He immediately became a has been by telling other people how to live - just like this one!
If his constant covid lies weren't bad enough, now we know he's having more sex than most of us. What a Jeremy Hunt.
Good
One puppet gone. Another will come over
Why do I feel like something sinister is going to happen and we are going to get someone much worse then Matt Hancock!
I am actually shocked and amazed that No one talks about him cheating on his wife !!!
👏👏👏👏👏🎆🎇✨
pog
NHS = Naughty Hancock Shags
Hancock is the biggest liar out there. I guess he can join Klaus with his great reset plan now.
Bloody Liar.. Like the rest of them..
He should have been fired on the spot yesterday by the PM. No question about that. Very pleased he’s resigned though. What little authority he had has disappeared now.
Everyone who wore a mask and took the vaccine has supported this man and his policies.
piss off handcock
Paddy Pants Down and now Matt Cock-In-hand. That's his life and her's finished.Idiots
Yay!
I am glad that Matt finally admits that making trade-offs between freedom, prosperity, and health is difficult. Of course, it is difficult, particularly when the virus is novel and the dynamic impact unknown. It is difficult not just for the UK, it is at least as difficult elsewhere! So why blame China for misdeed when this country was the very first one who battles this COVID-19.  Hypocrisy is very ugly indeed.
He thinks that with his resignation everything will be sorted. This charade smells bad
He has the decency to resign after his conduct. His boss did worse but remains in office, his ego trip is most vital for his existence.
I want to riot. These skumbags can take a big paid jobs, reap all the benefits, do nothing to save lives , but my mates made a few million pounds, now i will step down with no consequences.
Smoke and mirrors
Glad he’s resigned. Sick of the hypocrisy of the old boys’ network within politics, it is all so insidious. We try our best to follow the rules just to have the very people preaching those rules break them in the most obvious and selfish of ways. 🤷‍♀️😩
What an idiot....was it worth it
Are the sky commentators seeing the same photo as us(no comment) .
About bloody time , a year too late
More to the point - Borris was happy to sweep this under the carpet & he still runs the country !!!!!!!!
Still needs took up for shambles in care homes !!! And ppe!!! And don't forget Boris was just accepting HIS APOLOGY!!!
What crisis? We have a pandemic of sociopaths, psychopaths and compulsive liars .. we must eradicate this scourge.
He is a murderer. He will not get away with his crimes.
he hired her as his pa so they can have an affair without make it bait ( obvious ) ... wow
Why Is he yet to speak about cheating on his wife 😂
Good
“Build back better.....” just a shout out to those pulling the strings to come to his rescue.
Which job will they put him into to Fk it up.
in the meantime there is a massive protest in london...wheres the cctv of that..........
priti patel should be next letting all these migrants in
Everyone makes mistakes this man should of stood so tall and remained in post, I would like to see anyone else do half of what he has. !!!!!!!!
Build back better, with a clean sweep of the beeb, then move on to brexit traiters and finally to sort out the police...
Stop voting Tory and Labour.
This has cured my Covid-19
Perfect... Amazing... Fantastic... Bloody brilliant!
I felt it was quite dignified resignation really
What a seedy, sleazy second-rate failed-state banana constitutional monarchy!
Tell us when he resigns as an MP like he should.
Oh boo-hoo... The ugly little scrotum does a runner with a wallet fat enough to live 10 lifetimes. This is just a distraction folks...  Don't place your eye on the b*llocks... It takes your eye off the ball! He'll be replaced... There will be a new Genocide Minister!
Matt Handcock Variant No More!
Should have been sacked for being a disastrous health secretary, not screwing around with the paid staff.
GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH. liar, cheat and made millions for himself and friends out of covid
What was he thinking in the first place..! Did he really think it was a secret. Someone obviously knew, in order to hide a camera.
Tiny tears finally gives in....by the way he had taken both covid jabs at the time, unfortunately they don't provid 100% cover, bummer!!!
It's time this rat left
He shouldn't have resigned I don't see why he's private life should be  anyone's business
How  "not clever" he must be to do it in the front of camera..It all was set up..or somebody's revenge.... Something does not add up..
Brilliant now sturgeon should go
Clearly he didn’t run spell check on his resignation letter.
Good riddance to bad rubbish 👍👍👍
Very convenient . The current is an excuse to re leave him .Had his time , and some other fool is lined up already.
Escaping while he can.
After making millions and really bad decisions 😠
I think his wife had enough of his infidelity and taught him a lesson by installing CCTV in his office.
Now let's address that we have members of the civil service leaking security footage from inside government buildings in order to sabotage the government, that's the real story, not a hypocrite snogging his secretary.
Boris, next
It's everything we have come to expect from a senior politician. Rather than explaining why he's "got to resign" he should be telling us why he is a worthless sack of crap that takes advantage at every opportunity. Like many others, I have lost complete faith that our political system is working on our behalf.
He should have been sacked not resigned and made to pay a fine of £10.000 both of them
USELESS Lord ghetsis... *cough!* sorry I meant boris Johnson
Who is the next evil puppet?
Thank god for that. Total bellend, bye byeee
He's only sorry because he's been court goes to show what happens behind closed doors
Another yes man
“Everybody liked that”
Haha at last. Mr smarmy gone, but should have been gone ages ago, with all his dodgy dealings a d lies and now this puts the icing on the cake. One rule for them and one rule for us, a case of do as I say not as I do.
When is he going to jail then?
PM should resign for not sacking him in the first place.
Get out of jail free card this seems
F@@k off Hancock....
This would make for a good plan being caught cheating and resigning rather getting fired and charged for crimes against humanity
Seems like we are ruled by corrupt individuals and liars,m; scheming cowards
He sounds like a contestant on the X factor  that came second! Thanks for thanking us Matt, really heartfelt I’m sure!!!!  ...
He don't give a toss he's made alot of money 💰 and how do we know it's not been set up I mean they must have known there was CCTV this is easy way out for him -
What goes around comes around!
Sounds like a cover up for something bigger
Best news ive heard this week.
Next?
He should not be given another job in the cabinet at the next reshuffle.
Oh no not gove 😒  out of the frying pan comes to mind 😳
Great news.. Bloody good riddance!!!
Hancock must be playing 4D Chess so the affair overshadows the Millions of tax payers money funnelled to him. How did he not know CCTV Camera placements in his place of work?
A bollox to the end.   There's still the human rights abuses trials to come.
It was a planned set up. He looks guilty. And he will retire with multi millions.
Be interesting to know how the CCTV footage has been leaked.
I knew he would resign, but for some reason I thought  it may have been Monday or Tuesday? It is all coming out in the newspapers  now! Oh deary, deary me, said the Indian!
Men will never learn!
New vacancy for death secretary. Extensive history of covert deception is essential. Perverts preferred
Lol! Now let's end the mask fascism!
Cummings will be laughing his arse off lol 🤣
Can’t be held accountable now resigned. All by design. Absolute joke
the only reason this snivelling little weasel is sorry is because he was caught if he hadn't of been caught he would have carried on canoodling with his mistress
I never liked him but this wasn't anywhere close to a sackable offense all he is doing is encouraging similar witch hunts like what happened Cummings
Finally the weasel
Lets face it he had no choice but to resign
After Cummings now Hancock! Who is next on the chopping block?
Cant blame a man for grabbing a hand full of booty it is how we populate the world after all .
So he has done enough to resign but not enough for Boris to sack him
Damn bro all that for a bit of 🍑😂
So he gets away with everything he has done to this country 🤬
Should be in prison but it’s still the best news in ages.
Good riddance
Sky news = FAKE news
im fuming masks gone
He got kicked out. He didn’t have a choice
HOORAY!!!!!
Great news
Thank God this prat has gone.
Who's next??? Place your bets now please
Somehow labour will get blamed for this
Chess, not checkers. A very clever move after 18 months of his damage. Pay attention to the timing.
Gutted
Great
Celebrations yes at last. Creep.
See, they're dropping like flies.
What about the woman involved, surely she was misusing time we paid her for and what about contracts given to her family.]?
Go make a mask out of another pair of ....
Now get rid of the rest of the puppet show, Whitty, Valance, Ferguson and Johnson.
So what? He resigned rich asf and nothing will happen to him. It’s like he is free now to do whatever he wants
Who planted the camera and leaked the video ?
Lol
Spitting Image season 2 taking notes
This woman should go too
With his build back better speech at the end  he is saying he is still going along with the globalists and when the new nurenburg trials commence we must include him
1.52 photo of both of them is hilarious....lol :-)
this made my day :)
Resign from UK
he should still be in court with doris for the crimes of murder and other crimes dont forget i dont trust him and is scilly faces just like the fake tears is all fake
Sky news just said sajid javid is replacing matt hancock
All part of the plan … jump ship before s…t hits the fan 👌
A&E CONSULTANT, Manjeet Singh  Riyat , RIP
WOW! Best Aerial Footage Of MASSIVE LONDON FREEDOM MARCH Hugo Talks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLi7E8v4c9M
This is an advert for Scottish independence 😂🤣
I hope GC has gone too.
Hooray
Cummings laughing in his golden bath
I hope his constituents remember this at the next election and vote someone else in to his seat
Most hated man in england 👊👊
Slimy slimy weak man, how the absolute fk, does he pull????? 🤣🤣🤣
Now arrest him, and prosecute him for breaking their own rules/laws. A healthy prison sentence would be the icing on the cake.
Sorry but i don't give a crap
Fast forward, say, a year, and," He Will Be Back! ! !"
Bye bye
This is the only news story in the past year that has more likes then dislikes and I’m proud
perfect excuse and time for him to go , before he is held accountable for crushing our country
He is effectively my ultimate boss as I am a care worker - couldn’t have happened to a better hypocrite!!!
Why does he have to resign, when Boris et al are worse it terms of their behaviour?  Seems like a cover for worse stuff that's going on in the Conservative party and, particularly, the cabinet members. Who will replace him? Someone more extreme than him in terns of screwing the plebs.
He didn't get any decisions right a pack of lies!
Should have obided by the rules he lay down and kept is pecker in his trousers now he got his wife to deal with hope she takes him for everything.
Seriously? A tory who resigns simply for being a terrible person? If this takes off then tommow there will be zero tories left.
Just a political stunt after the Cummings revelations, resigning because of an affair looks better on your CV than being sacked through incompetence.
His real mistake was to think that he was one of the ruling elite who are working to bring into effect the 'Big Reset' and therefore thought that he was untouchable. Big mistake, the ruling elite who are working to bring the 'Big Reset' into practice are very few in number and will gladly sacrifice any of their minions whose activities or indiscretions threaten to get in the way of their greater ambitions. He had his arm twisted to resign because the philandering Boris would have appeared even more hypocritical had he sacked him.
What a spanner
Great news he should be behind bars his a curropt murderer
Hes Killed a lot of people ESPECIALLY  The Old People Wake up
These politicians can't even be faithful to their families, yet the public keep voting for them like they are so faithful to this country or the people of this country!
Hancock should be in prison along with Boris
If I going to a shop tonight I am not wearing no mask no more about time we stood up Not let The likes of Matt Hancock And the MPs Make fools of us  No more Come on people The Laughing in our faces
He's busy congratulation  himself!!   so arogant  His behaviour is unforgivable   We will not forget  we will not listen to this man . his words are  meaningless
Hes only sorry he got caught
I wonder what kind of a payout he got
great news good riddance to bad rubbish don't come back Matt Hancock
Has everyone noticed how he keeps saying 'guidance' instead of 'law'?
Good riddance.......who's the next lying ba##ard coming in to power?
Bye Bye Dickhead
I thought we were in a pandemic that made human contact to dangerous, even life threatening, it's funny how the architect of these Draconian restrictions doesn't seem to think they apply or believe in them himself. Questions need to be answered, why weren't the preventative measures that were implemented during the SARS 03, MERS 09 and H1N1 pandemics not at any point during this pandemic not put onto place, why was the magnitude of this virus exaggerated , the 1958-9 influenza pandemic was worse than this, the Hong Kong flu a decade later just as bad, what happened to the text book of standard procedure in how to manage pandemics. Yes he should go but not before we know the answers to these and a host of other questions.
Disgraceful. He should have been frog marched out of Parliament.
He had to go!🤨
He is beyond arrogant and puffing himself up whilesupposing apologising and will still work
Typical politician behaviour...breaking rules, affairs and disdain for the general public, his position was untenable. 🤪
Whose the next stooge in place of him. 😂🤣
Scrap the NHS save us not the NHS run it to the ground to save us then privatise it its way to corrupt and wasteful
He is A Disgrace 2 THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY HES LIED AND LIED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLDSO MANY LIES
Billions in profit secured for pharmaceutical corporations. Mission accomplished. He'll disappear to some obscure tropical island to live in luxury.
Wow good news and no lies from Sky!!!! Things are changing
He says clap for the NHS the only thing he is clapping is his assistance cheeks
0:01 take a shot everytime this bumbling idiot says the words: "uhh" and "um"
Hallelujah, his wife needs to kick him out now, he's a disgrace.
(
Snake
What an appalling, self-congratulatory, resignation speech.
Now what? This doesn't necessarily mean the way is now open to new start and a turning of the tide of madness. We could end up with someone worse.  Maybe this a litmus test situation. If the new minister doesn't accelerate the roll back of restrictions, to curry favour and defuse the rage, then we will know for sure that there really is an extraordinary agenda.
Treason!!!!!!!
GOOD!!! He has always been INEPT, ARROGANT, and IGNORANT of his office and of the people he has KILLED!!!
Be interesting to see if he gets re-elected
That's one virus we're rid of.
We don't need the likes of Hancock as a backbencher.
What a creepy spineless puppet this cheating man is.
Ding dong the shagger has gone
She looks like E.T.
He's a scummy idiot. His wife deserves better. All those pictures of his smarmy grin, with that woman must be so painful for his family. I couldn't bare that. The homewrecker should face consequences too.
He's been caught and NOW we deserve honesty 🙄🙄
So sad heart breaking.  Oh well let's move on . Toad in the hole tonight which is nice .
No morals
Liars always trip themselves up in the end. Never thought I'd say this I've been conservative all my life but would like to give keir starmer a chance
Good riddance. That level of hypocrisy DEMANDS his notice.
"Build back better... whilst I destroy my family" I have no words for this vermin.
Finally, a Matt Hancock story that gets a thumbs up majority.
Finally get somebody more compident in and do a proper job next gavin Williamson needs to go
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I will only be happy when I see this creature jailed for his part in this evil scam.
Bring back the death penalty for traitors.
People are so gullible and naive.  He's laughing all the way. Maleficence in public office is the correct outcome. Not resigning. 🤦‍♂️
Handy cock the hypocrite had to go.
What a foolish man. He had a fantastic job but failed to carry out his duties in an honourable and honest manner. Just look at what a fling has done. Was it worth it?
There is no date and time stamp on the CCTV cam so he started doing his job back in 2018 two years before this covid, and the CCTV looks likes older than 2020 to me.
about time.NO SYMPATHY at all
He'll be on #imaceleb next, making love to a witchetty grub
*"I'm sorry I got caught"
Good bye to bad rubbish
If Matt Hancock has resigned for breaking covid rules ,  then surely Kay burley and Beth rigby should do the same , I can't believe they are allowed to carry on questioning politicians and what they have done has been swept under the carpet , come on sky surely this is hypocracy at the highest level.
Matt Hancock#TopShagger!!
Oi weasel I dont hear an apology!?
Screwing the nation won't get a resegnation, but screwing the aide will!
Best news ever
Time for Boris to go and the rest of the government too and as for what Dominic cummings said he is correct with every word
All a stage show.... So  Boris didn't have to sack him for  been a tool at his job
Hahaha
Good, now he needs to go to prison for crimes against humanity.
One gone seven to go,  And stop acting like your doing the decent thing,  the country is disgusted with the hypocrisy and double standards that is rampant in todays politics 🤮👎
Yes at least we haven't got to see this moron anymore
Will he be getting a fine aswel
He has made MILLIONS  including  his Relatives  out ofThis Scamdemic  no wonder hes Resigned  He CAN AFFORD TO
Send him to jail
For bracking covid rules, hahaha i like that one
good riddance
Just about to Vomit
Only sorry he was caught like em all
What a joke does anyone believe anything from him he has been called out on his lies and BS. It's all been staged. He should have gone to the march today and said sorry to the 500 thousand of people there..they would have been glad to see him sky show that instead of this s*** Get him in jail
Boris and co should now resign for destroying the country for the flu. More shame to follow.
AT LAST!!!!!!!!
Take it she has resigned too?
Is this the calm before the storm ?.
Wonderful news
Delete my comment com on lol
Good
Running away with millions., needs to be arrested
Tell him not to go far because he will be asked a lot of questions when the investigations start.
Meanwhile in Other News 💉💰🇩🇪  Thousands of people Marching through      The  Streets of London AGAIN 🙄
Bye-bye, good Riddance, 🤬🤬🤬.
I hope he still faces charges for crimes against humanity.
Good riddance
That’s an satisfying news
He will be replaced with another lying pos.probably worse.
Matt Hancock more comical than Tony Hancock.  Jail time please, and open the country fully up from tomorrow 27th June 2021....chop chop
I'm still trying to get my head around what woman would want an extramarital affair with Matt Hancock.
I wonder if the police will be knocking on his door and issuing a fine for breaking covid rules.......mmmmm let's think 🤔 don't think so!!!!!
Tray is a good day
Boris was so quick to defend him but we know that's because his morals are no better!
Wonder who planted the camera in his office? Could this be a national security breach Carrie?
Tidy escape
He has mad MILLIONS out of This Scam demic
Well this current government is full of idiots,
So he should. Most people in this country have sacrificed so much and should not let this idiot stunt the momentum.  Politicians lie, fame hungry youtubers and Internet hoaxers lie.... Do not mistake the scientists and students and professors and doctors that have worked tirelessly to protect us all  for politicians like this creep or youtubers that say the vaccine is a Bill Gates microchip......
👍well done
Good riddance
Fantastic, criminal resigns
He is still a bloody sleaze Bag Oh let's all put are hand together and give him a f------g    Good PUSH out of the country
This guy is unbelievable, perhaps he was testing his eyes too! Only sorry now he has been busted, disgraceful excuse for a human. God only knowes who we are going to get to fill his shoes?
Next: BJ
What about saying sorry to all the people that could not hug or even see their love ones to say goodbye when they were dying.
I love seeing how much the reporter is enjoying his job right now
😂😂😂😂😂. So, what about the lady friend.
That bel end needs arresting and prosecuting
Saving life's by shagging wives
Crettin 😡
WHAT ABOUT THE MILLIONS HE HAS MADE PUSHING THE WHOLE SHAM - ARREST HIM FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY this obvious little get out ploy planned long ago he is getting out before the truth gets out en mass
All world governments have had their day! (Daniel 2:44) JW.org
All planned - he needed a way, out is Doris going soon before he gets the Guillotine.  Is there an an award for destroying a nation and the NHS.
How idiot they are,just trying to change the subject,its not about just social distance, its about how idiot they both were because they were both married, how the can come to camera and say such lies
Pass of yah prack yah duckd this country over during covid. Got yah mates rich and ate ubereats every night at great expense to the tax payer
This means, his Amazon shares have just sold for millions and he doesn't need a job.
Still won’t help him if they are ever held account for all the lies and deaths they are responsible for. Nuremberg trials 2
Great! Next up Sturgeon 🤣🍿🍺.
finally
A mass murderer, criminal, fraudster, is allowed to resign🧐😒 if we did 1% of what he did🤔 will be in prison already🤷‍♂️‼️
HAHAHA! Goodbye HanCOCK! And goodbye to your pointless on going restrictions too, fingers crossed.
Prison next for Matt Hancock for crimes against humanity...
Damnnnnnnnnn
They only resign when their PR and public image becomes terrible. Not when they repeatedly fail their job.
What about the company where his brother is a director and he owns 15% and they game themselves a ppe contract and made millions, thief’s
The Bible! King James Version - Proverbs 6:26 : "For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread." Another one bites the dust.
While we were unable to hug granny, Hancock was licking fanny!
Mathew Handcock cancelled
Another clown will replace him.
Perfectly staged drama.  The powers to be wanted him off for his crimes against humanity, stepdown or else.
Don't be distracted. This is a distraction. He is trying to run away from the crimes he has done. This is is planned
Lmao.... he should be sacked from the government altogether.
And build back better 🤪
About Time Good Ridence
F#cking shambolic. This government is a disgrace. Yet people voted these pieces of s#it into power. So much wrong with this country.
He should be jail ASAP
Good riddance… now let’s oust the rest of em… let’s be honest there probably at it with each other or each other’s spouses
Should take Johnson with him ta ta tosser
will fail upwards and be replaced by the same no one should comply with any of this bullshit now
If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, you'd better believe it's a weasel!
Can he be punished further for breaching the rules?
AND SO HE BLOODY WELL SHOULD   Now to court for his accountability for his crimes against humanity So sad for his children,1 for them having THAT as a father and 2 for the humiliation they will face forever for having HIM as their "dad"!!!!
Thank God this liar has gone - he needs to be arrested for crimes against humanity
He's going to guantanamo
Good riddance
It’s a scam. He will be alright nest feathered.
What next? Boris ended up marrying the bird whose head of a big bank chain?
finally
WHAT A HORRIBLE WITCH LOOKING WOMAN HE DECIDED TO HAVE AN AFAIR WITH….
Great riddance 👍👍👍 Now sack him from all his "back benches" positions and investigate him for awarding of contracts to his pals. Haven't liked this sleazebag from minute 1.
that vile b/stud is going to need protection 24/7 for the rest of his life.
Give him a leathal injection, the same vax he's been pumping into the general public!
WALLAD
Good riddance, he can now flip off
Matt Hancock said "Build Back Better" in his video. Traitors working for the WEF all of them.
I am Delighted to see Mr Footdick leaving under such embarrassing circumstances. Good riddance. 👋
I hope his mistress also resigns or gets the sack? There were two arseholes in that video!
Now prosecute him if he and cronies agave made money profiteering from this plandemic. He should be banned from any public office
😆😆😆 What a tool. No doubt boris will reapoint him somewhere the reshuffle.
None the wiser before and after. Dont care, same type will replace him
Nice distraction from the massive London protests.
Good riddance...
What a helmet!
Did someone set him up cause how did they get hold of the footage lol
It's like love island for Gina Coladangelo waiting to see who's next
This great news but He will just be replaced with another Moron
Some news worthy of a 👍
Good riddance to bad rubbish
He keeps the millions he's stolen and he still has his job. I don't see any punishment here at all.
Charge him with fraud
Is all this staged?
Resigned for negative distancing with a female aide.
Oh no! Anyways…
All this trouble hes been through. He should've just used his hand and co....
lol all the jealous single losers dancing for joy over this
He still has a job though
4:12  news reader cuts other news reader off what was he gonna say about the other MPs comong forward?
erm
When does the Nuremburg style trial start ?. He needs to pay for what he has done.
That's NOT hancock in the image kissing that lady! Look at his sausage style hairline  Look at the hair line in the picture compared to his hair walking around in this clip
He will be given another government job by next month so he won’t to bothered 🤫
Now all the gullable people are jabbed up hes off....lol
Is it me or does Hancock look like droopy from looney tunes?
Why is he talking about the pandemic it's got nothing to do with what he did he cheated on his wife he may have breached covid rules but whats worse cheating on your wife or breaching covid rules
He really had no option he broke our government rules on coronavirus such a pity 😔and lacking Integrity as a minister of the Crown.
Thank goodness. Boris next!!!
boris is has bad now
Wtf y r u all hating on this guy, he shouldn’t have to resign coz he likes  a woman and frankly media should have no business in his private life
Thank Christ
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is he that above us that he doesn't have to wear a seatbelt either 🤔
EXCELLENT
Westminster lost an actor
Shame he don't top himself and take the rest of them Tory rats with him !!
Now if Boris could just do the same and someone who is actually a conservative could replace him that would be peachy
It took him over 24 hours to realise he needed to resign? The NHS is the best gift? Yeah, it has been to his and his friends bank accounts. And still the cheek to drop that 'Build back better' line; still trying to appease the Masters? It's just the sheer audacity for me.
Sacrifices x 1 sacrifices x 2 sacrifices x 3 build back better. Fix the problems in social health care once and for all, but from the back benches. Heard that. A final solution no less. He's giving us the nod.
Of all the things he should have been ousted for, this is the least of them.
Best news in ages xxxxxxxxx
I liked the part where he apologised 😂😂
The man is a tit. Good riddance!
Cummings tried to get rid of him.  In the end it was his trouser snake not being able to hold back from temptation that has done him. Hancock.. what an apt name.
Well that's a surprise. He fell on his pork sword 😲 What's the betting he'll soon be giving evidence against the government the same as Cummings
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, Hay Hay Hay GOODBYE. Good residence to bad rubbish 🗑
Whens he getting fined? I mean after all,  he set the law out and he knowingly broke it. Resignation is not enough!
These are the people RUNNING OUR COUNTRY! Not working at Sainsbury’s or making our maccies. These people are responsible for millions of people and they are just plain BAD PEOPLE 🙄🙄🙄
Bloody conman.
Finally
I know these comments are gonna be absolutely hilarious! 😂😂😂
Not a mention from sky on the big freedom protest in London today...instead they distract with this establishment stooge.
Another thieving bigot who failed to even lie badly .A sickly self centered slimeball that needs to build back better under a rock in the middle of a desert
Pandemic bollocks  the pandemic is the vaccines 💉🥵
Next public fear will be who will replace him. Hope not from frying pan into fire!
Fucccc yesss
Walloper
Hooray but the problem is someone’s worst is going to be put in his place
I wonder how many people in the comments that are cheering that he's gone changed allegiance and voted Conservative to get Brexit through?
Good bye
He made the biggest cock up in his life but at least he,s had the balls to go
A smug arrogant remorseless controlling privileged insincere self centred adulteress and politician! It sickens us all…
He's on the right wing gravy train...he'll be managing the British Library next week or working for JP Morgan.
Sneaky eye's, where is Prince Andrew.
Blo*-dy good riddance  !!!
Hahahahahahahahahahaha so finally someone in the government did their job right
Does anybody actually believe this scripted pantomime bullshit.
Give it 6 months and he'll be crept back in another role.
He need to leave immediately. He was treating us like sheeps for a whole year and what he did ???  He broke the f,,,, rules he used to shout at the interviews every singe day .  I remember some people here were fed up with him and God is biggg right ?  Everyone get what they deserve 😉
Good
One pleb down and now on to the next one, what a vile hypocrite!
I am amazed, I think this is the first honest act he has taken :D
Get a proper doctor in, not one linked to bloody organisations or nobodies like hack job.  We don't want a faouchi v2.
This man doesn’t resign because he mishandled a global pandemic which costed the life of thousands but resigns because he had an affair 😵‍💫
His dishonesty has reached rock bottom.
First act of new health minister - access Dr Tess Lawrie of BIRDs meta analysis handed to Matt Hancock six months ago ......and start saving far more lives now. The gov knows its going to take till 2025 to vaccinate the world. We can't go on like this. Dr Lawrie has a solution to bridge that gap, save lives and allow the economy to get back to normal. Travel too. Please all write to your MP and demand her findings are implemented. Two clients of Dr Lawrie are the NHS and the WHO.
Charity boxing event: the public vs hancock
Not following rules anymore 🖕🖕🖕  I’m done   HandCock Royal Ascot UEFA G7
This is very good news but this dude look like Tony Blair 😳🤣
He was the personification of arrogance.
Rules for thee but not for me :)
What a putrid  individual
Not following rules anymore   I’m done  HandCock Royal Ascot UEFA G7
what i am concerned about is what else has security sold to media
This is the first time I’ve seen a sky news video with a good like to dislike ratio😂
Now the rest of the swamp needs draining
If something is in the media it’s because the government want it in the media. The media is totally controlled. Just look at the disgusting fear mongering over the past 18 months. No integrity whatsoever. Hancock is just another puppet. Who are the puppet masters? At least he won’t be around to dupe in delight anymore!
I should bloody well think so! Now let's get rid of the rest of the cabal, bring it on!
Has to be a psychopath. Pretending to cry on television, locking people up like animals and cheating on his wife whilst making millions.
Good.  He's destroyed everything.  Hopefully we'll see him again at Nuremburg.  Don't let this distract from the protesting good people in London today.
Clown act. Keep drama at a personal low level for people to consume. Keeps people fighting at a left vs right mindset instead of up vs down mindset.
Big Freedom March in London but the msm just wants to talk about Handcock resigning......
Absolute shambles - he should have gone months again
I didn't know having an affair in a deadly pandemic was perfectly fine, shame I couldn't hug my Nan
He knew he would/should resign - why stress everyone about it.
No one on earth is perfect only in jesus because his blood cover our sins.💋thats where forgiveness comes in play.♥️
*Good Riddance*
Pog
Boris Johnson is also a playboy .
Overpaid snake
The rest will follow
It’s about time the little mug!
He's quit so he can have more family time, who's family is yet to be decided
But remember…  Boris accepted his apology and the matter was delt with! Right!?  Speaks volumes on his decision making!
Then arrest him for murder
His behaviour is proof that the restrictions we are still stuck in are utter bs.
Best news I've ever heard.but who replaces him? probably the anti Christ.
The whole thing stinks, its all been staged to take the heat off the lot of them, the truth will come out, if people believe he would stand under a camera that he would have 100% known was there
Get the champagne out UK
Fantastic News!!
Bet his wife told him to resign or else
Sex at work is part of the New World Order. We will own nothing and they will have all the extramarital sex.
Take notice of this side show, he needs locked up for the damage he has done to this country and people
Fantastic  news !!!! But traitors should be hanged!!!🥰🤣🇬🇧
He along with others in government including Boris should be in jail after the PPE scandal nevermind Hancock resigning! I bet he gets a big payout for resigning too!
Dosser
Not sure if it’s general knowledge but the woman who was caught with is the daughter of man who owns a pharmaceutical company. I wonder if…
I really wouldn't want to be around him right now if I was his family
So Boris Johnson did not have complete confidence in him.
Lock him up
I'm very proud of what I've done, having a wife at home, and kissing another one at work . Bravo Mr. Peacock
Load of rubbish... this is roose a for him to avoid difficult questions about midazolam genocide etc.....
Great man ,so proud  to have so humble people in government    The media  need to have a real look at themselves
We are all laughing now but let's be honest here, we should be absolutely furious with it all, they have taken the piss out of us throughout this whole shitbang. They've lied to us countless times and we should rise up and fight against this tyrannical regime... I'm not sure I can even call us the "United Kingdom" if we aren't "united" in fighting for our freedoms...
Can we bring back public executions?
More deceptions for the sheeple... The awakened will see through
Sky news why not call for his arrest?
sheeeeesh
It doesnt matter if he resigned or not , he is a puppet thats played his part well, the damage has already been done and another puppet with the same agendas will be there to quickly replace him.
So he should he goes on live television saying people from seperate households they can’t meet like couples who don’t live together then he has a mistress on the side who he sleeps with, dirty vile man.
Remember Matt Hancock is only part of the problem. The whole system needs to change🤔
What about the woman tho
Desmond Swayne for Health Secretary!!
Pm said  he should be very proud of what he's  done   ((180thousand  deaths  left loved ones in misery lies upon lies cronyism contracts  complete failures (staggering)
Great news - though he clearly does not understand as otherwise, he would never have put himself in that position.  Another senior mp bungles it - good riddance.
Himself along with others live in there own world , it is the rest of us who live in the real world ,  he’s the real life criminal who gets mega pay for others misery
Who am i going to hate now i have so much choice. Please can people give me any ideas on who next. 🇬🇧👍
What about breaking your marriage vows he’s not said a word about it.
Well Johnson has his scapegoat now come the public enquiry...not that he wasn't as corrupt as hell
Let's be honest no one gives a f about this goverments rules and this is the reason
Now send him to jail
Distraction... he gave out millions to his mistresses  brother.. all known by the government at the highest level... so now the government will blame him. But he will be chilling at his private mansion. This is a joke. Haha
Good riddance..even if it is all planned.
crimes against humanity the lot of em
So he should the little weasel!
One less THEIF in Westminster!!!!
It’s a good thing he’s gone but knowing boris he will still be on secret government contracts anyway
Good riddance.
Bye don’t hit the door on your way out
What a disaster, in the middle of the biggest health emergency of our time the UK health secretary has to resign because he can’t keep his hands to himself, what an utter disgrace this Government has become.
Scapegoated
I Wonder Why😏
Hopefully, his parliamentary constituency party will be looking into deselecting him as their MP
It's kinda hard to be optimistic when there's ponies eating bread off the pavement feasting, stay paid though, its hard to make amends as I'm losing all my money and my friends, damn, they should'a dropped me when I was born, now I'm trapped in defiance of the thorns.
Best news this year , his bit of fluff has resigned as well , what a coincident.
Wish the whole corrupt government would resign
BORRRRRRING... 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Thank effin for that he's filth
Now take his property and money. Sky news will show him sympathy they are members of the same club .
The pig is bailing out because he knows the scamdemic game is up.
Just as long Johnstone leaves Truss and Sunak in place
Johnson next please!
Now that he's done the right thing. The question is now disciplinary procedures for the leaker of the video. They're bound by the official secrets act, it now raises the question if they can leak this to media, they're a security liability, and should be removed from their post in case they leak more sensitive information.
Good, now make him accountable..  Prison is too good for him.
But was anyone this upset when Sturgeon was walking around without a mask while in close contact of others during serious lockdown? He said he was sorry after caught which is what she did.....I mean isn't saying "I'm sorry" supposed to get them out of trouble? That's how they treat it!
This whole thing was a distraction from his corruption
I'd like to see any of his critics, do better, in a national emergency...... It's easy to criticise...... but very difficult to do better.......
Great news. Matt Hancock enjoyed his powers of enslaving the people whilst rewarded himself with enjoying extra-marital sex
Great he got under my skin
Should have been sacked never mind resign. Hypocrite now he wants to be with his family after he's done the dirty should have been booted out. Complete idiot to think we can't see through him, he's still trying to sqirm out of it.
Him saying his private life This happend  at work 😂
At last something decent on the news !!! Get lost 🖕
Good!
Good riddance
Don't let the door hit your arse on the way out ...  Made lots of money in back handers Had some fun with the aid he hired with our money Broke the rules he enforced on us that have cost people their livelihoods.
Now get him locked up!!!
Good riddance
Got to look at Boris now! Boris said that he accepted his apology and considers the issue over, that’s not acceptable and he needs to go too!
no fake tears this time?
Excellent news. Legal actions against him and others of his ilk should now proceed with transparency without government interference.  Real reason is obviously not sex related but instead the allocation of Coronavirus linked contracts to his associates.
So the sacrificial Lamb has been cast adrift.  he did his job by lying to the nation about the COVID scam.
Time to get rid of the rest of the lying self serving pigs and bring ever last one of them  to be accountable for there treasonous actions against England and her people .and to be tryed under English law .
welcome to the uk loves
Wouldn’t surprise me if this was staged
This guy is literally going to laugh, I mean look at him
ive never seen the comments so happy, look at that like ratio aswell!
Weyyy
About time
He has a tiny bit of honour left - the only good decision he has made
Even his resignation letter sounds like a crock of 🐕💩.
Slimy, sleazy little man.
He should have been sacked ages ago! Handing out dodgy contracts to his mates and family members!
Finally...
my best day ever this year seeing this clown go but still no punishment clean exit
More Tory sleaze
What a melt
Finally!
Probably more worried what his wife will do to him lol
That was a costly kiss
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍😂😂
Fabulous news... now the rest of them should follow.. as they are all corrupt lying individuals.
Things I've lost: A family friend  Thousands of pounds  Hugging family at my brother's funeral   Things Matt lost: No time grabbing her arse
The like to dislike ratio says it all! 😂👍
Do as I say, not as I do.
Matt HanCOCK: "I was lost my job as health secretary for little pussy"..
haha 😛
😃🙂
Wonderful man! Will miss him very much
The only thing Matt Hancock sacrificed was the 10,000's of OAPs in nursing homes and the £32 Billion to Dildo Harding for the failed track and trace
Best news ever ! Boris Mop head next please  !
Nonsense dribble eulogy, your words have no substance
Boris' worst nightmare. Who's going to be his scapegoat after the public enquiry into the governments mishandling of covid now?
My family working hospital  non stop .
YEEEEEEESSSS!!!!!!
Goodbye to the Liar!
Glad to see Matt had both 🙌 hands on to get to the bottom 🍑 of this matter 😂 😂 send him to The Hague
Now Boris must resign!
Good riddance
All we need is for England to win the euros and It’ll be the best summer ever 😂
Ok right now this dumass is gone can we be free now 😂
fall guy, money and a seat in the house of lords will follow
One Down More To Go
Almost as funny as the sports minister shutting gymsnsjdnhasnt even entered one himself lol health minister what  joke government
Resigned...needs to be jailed for what he has done to the people of this country
Good!  Sympathies to his dear wife!
OMFG FINALLY!!!!!!!
At last his gone.Get ready for HMP
It would be fun to see him back in the news in a few months pulling a Cummings, and bashing Boris.
Good ridens to him hypocrisy and lies he should be ashamed of himself and band from politics not to mention the embarrassment to his wife and family
He should be charged with crimes against humanity along with boris and sage
He got caught in 4k and he resigns in 4k lol
No doubt, another mongrel will reach him.
About bloody time!!
Coward.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
I don't know why he resigned . He helped to cherry pick the ironically  named SAGE "experts" whose advice he then followed. All the eminent (lol) experts of SAGE should resign. If the House of Commons required people of integrity it would be empty. How are things going, Mr Johnson? Sleep tight.
♥️♥️♥️
About time!!!!!!!
He’s still trying to claim loads of credit as he skulks away! ...What a weasel.
He should have been sacked
Can't stand the bloke glad he's gone
Goodbye to a sleazy,creepy,corrupt politician,what a shame he can’t take Boris with him.No respect for this government anymore,just pure hype and waffle!!
Anyone who states in a letter "I am writing" shouldn't be in any position of power.
*Everyone Liked That*
One down…
"The NHS is a gift"... to profiteering tory sleazebags
We should remember he never resigned for breaking the rules, or the public's trust. He resigned because he was caught.
It’s good to know Timmy Mallet has been appointed by BJ to replace MH immediately !
I Things will still be the same,im sure  Nadhim 'Dr Death' Zahawi will take over...
should of happened ages ago but lets not be fooled resign means he still gets all the benefits govement allows should of been sacked but why would boris do that when he lives his life cheating of his wifes multiple times and getting others pregnent
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA !!
For sure this is the work of Dominic Cummings digging up dirt on the government. I wonder who will be next on his list🤔 I bet there are alot of Ministers feeling very nervous at the moment, especially Boris 😳
Vax macht frei. Herr Hancock ist kaput.
He should be in jail
Seriously, I sure he isn't the ony  one who has done this, he just happened they caught on cctv, tithead  😂 😂
If the prime minister had stuck to the Covid guidelines. Only leaving number 10 for essential reasons, having the chefs furloughed already why were there not questions how the prime minister got Covid early on in the virus? Why wasn’t he on the way out?
LET'S GOOOOO
"the NHS is the best gift the nation could have ever given itself". actually it was because of labour that we even have an NHS 👍
Hahahahah, guilt speaks its own word's
This isn't like losing your job for real people. He has just resigned from a particular post yet he is still a politician and there has been zero accountability re dodgy contracts to cronies and misuse of public funds. What should actually happen is arrest and a ban from politics. For so long the public has endured lie upon lie from politicians we have become apathetic and tired and begin to accept it as acceptable or the norm. It isn't. Plus,let's not get started on "build back better" . It wasn't the public who crippled to economy,closed businesses,lost livelihoods,instigated agendas  and generally turned the UK Into a totalitarian state,it was this government.
Should be jail
so it escapes through the cracks like a slithery thing . Not sure something like that 😕.
Thank god
Draconian rule will be no longer  POWER TO THE PEOPLE 💪💪🕉🙏🌍
https://youtu.be/WLi7E8v4c9M
now pay a fine like every one else 10.000
Tories doing what they do best. Telling lies, helping out their mates under the table and getting away relatively scot free
120,000 dead, and he gets to walk away,,,,,na
I just hope Boris doesn't put Gove in as health secretary or we are really f****d
Horn ball B===@💦(o)
Sorry is not going cut it 👎🏻
This is a victory for everyone in the UK he has let down and screwed over  Boris is next
6⁶
Get fucked matt 😂
GOOD NOW BORIS
And let's face it, if he hadn't have been caught out the affair would have continued along side with the hypocrisy!
Everything, I really think, is pre-planed for the public’s consumption. He won’t loose out on much. He will still be in the lap of luxury.  Remember the time he feigned a cry? They are AL good actors!  The footage of him with the lady, it seemed for the camera. I am loosing trust in everything they say and everything they do.
Him snogging that bird makes me want to vote all over her pretty face
now let's hope we don't get another one like him
If the nhs staff is the best gift why are the tories constantly trying to screw it up
How come Cummings didn't know ?
Good news  . The whole nation abide law in order . Sacrifice for 15 months though .
looooooooooool
Just yet another example of how our corrupt government goes about there business.
Set up
Now let’s investigate how many of his and Doris’s mates were awarded lucrative contracts
He should have been sacked!
agenda 2030 dont forget
eyyyy, at least he can't hand out contracts to his relatives anymore!
Happy Saturday everyone enjoy the sun
what difference does it make? hes still profited of this pandemic for him, his sister and his mates for millions! he will probably be head hunted for a new corrupt job on 60k atleast.
Everyone happy today
Need the PM, Michael Gove and Gavin Williamson to go next.
Good that this lockdown weasel has gone, hopefully he won't be replaced by another lockdown weasel
Whole Tory is a shamble
Now let's go for his life.  Come on someone give out his home address.
It was the only way.
Nothing to celebrate. We are still being held prisoners for a deadly mutating virus that appears to only exist in the news media...
Lol
I’m sure he will be flying off to a private island to count his blood money. It’s all a ruse. He’s bled us all dry…literally. He should be investigated, the shared in vaccines and the cronyism. He is corrupt, along with the rest of them.
Even in his resignation letter he misses the point and lies
Ask  Yourselves  was this a clever set up ? ..  as he's no longer accountable for all those  deaths!
Don't believe a word he said, he has no soul which shows in his dead eye's!!!
This may be a contrived event,men will never learn to see the danger that this type of woman cause,hurt to so many people and to try and coerce the subject to a state of dependency,this woman will carry this for the rest of her life,Mr.Hancock will keep on rising after a while,she will always be an embarrassment to her family.
Good
If only Bunter, Gove, Williamson, Truss, Rees-Mogg, Patel, Jenrick and all the other twats would follow
👍👍👍👍👍👍
That’s TREASON and should be acknowledged as such. A person betraying such a position of trust. Disgusting.
no apology though
Fair play now could we have priti patel .resignation please.
NEXT!!!
He doesn't "understand the sacrifices" we have made because he's made none himself. Same as all MPs and advisers on full pay while others bankrupted and destroyed by irrational regulations. Hypocrites one and all.
We need change as soon as possible civil servants did all.work re vaccines not corrupt hancock.or johnson
Yesssss
Something Dodgy about this whole thing, the way he was acting on the CCTV, he wanted out before the investigation into how the government have dealt with covid, he believes his own hype, he doesn't strike me as someone who would just resign?? Plenty of interviews to show that
Do some people really think that Handcock would put himself his family & that of the government from a "deadly virus" at risk?!
Thank the lord, best news ever, 👏👏👏👏now he needs punishment
Considering the shambles of the way it was handled from the beginning, he should not have resigned over an affair he should have been sacked 18 months ago!
So still not going to apologise to his wife?
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Will he be arrested now for breaching Covid guidelines?
Give her a jab from me Matt.
Well done
Prison
who cares 🙀🙈🤭
Good news at last,  Slimy peasant...🐍🐍🐍
And that's the last we'll ever see of him. He'll be off crying in a corner somewhere now.
Well one down just boris the clown to go
Surely he should repay his salary from the last year as well.
He's human
Boris should have sacked him instead of him resigning due to pressure
It's not just Hancock look at G7.. Boris and all the other leaders well they can kiss goodbye to the public following the rules now.. no mask, no distancing, no restrictions anymore...
Oh no, Bumbling Boris has lost his political meat-shield.  What I'd like to know is: was Hancock allowed to take Barnaby the house plant home with him? He needs at least one friend after all.
I couldn’t see my granny, he could lick some fanny
Good riddance!! We should see a decline in lies from now on - some hope!!!
Good
Almost like he wanted to get caught so he could dissapear and get away with everything he’s done
“I understand”  What a lot of nonsense, these people understand nothing about the ordinary world
Should have done it earlier...disgusting
Off to prison now…
Good riddance, no trust in a liar like Hancock. Get someone in now that is actually capable of doing the job.
Let's be real, he won't suffer TOO much, he's made packets from the (so called) pandemic, its common knowledge that he has a 75% shareholding in the vax companies he was pushing.  I don't think he'll be missed too much by anyone, least of all me
This is probably the first time In history that an affair lead to something good
THE CABAL IS FALLING 😁🙏🌍
Good maybe this a sign to the governement that no one is following the rules. Open up the country FFS
Just hearing there was a few people marching in London today. Can't find any news on it though?????
He should be in jail, not walking away with the millions he's made from our misery! No justices at all!
This incident just makes his comments about Rosena Allin-Khan's tone all the more hilarious. Cheating is fine, but don't talk to me in mean way to me please :(((
Finally
Even now he seeks to hide the whole truth. His aides brother works in a private healthcare c6mpany.
Also borris saying well done to him he done grate job ?wtf lol 😆. Bet its because Hancock has lots of dirt on all of them 😆 🤣 they all corrupt
Getting to hot in the kitchen and these bell ends run straight out of the door….Typical Tory behaviour!!!
This isn’t a victory. He should be in jail
Probably be replaced with an even bigger shill / Zionist
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
What a shame.
Good riddance
He's "fawken hopeless"  for sure.😅
what a chad
She is like Harris, screw her way to the top.
The little fat PM should go now
Dishonest same as this corrupt government
This is probably the best decision he has ever made
Should be on trial for treason next
Back Benches for a while! Then a Peerage!
This bellend is right up there in the pantheon of worst ministers ever
He’s making enough money to last a lifetime. I’m sure he’s crying tears of sadness resigning into his fortune he’s made or invested in
We don’t want his thanks. We want a proper pay rise.
I was expecting a comments are closed bar. Cool
Good,who’s next.
PLANDEMIC.Another masonic trick.
So he resigns as health secretary but it doesn't say he is leaving government. What cushy tax payer funded role will he be moved into? Also, is anyone going to hold Bojo the clown to account for giving him his "full backing"? Is there no end to the disgusting corruption and hypocrisy of this government? The arrogance of these hateful cretins is breathtaking. Drain the F ing swamp
nooo, he was so cute
He’s a weasel brought surffering to everyone in the country
The whole party is a joke. These fools tells us what to do, and they do as they please.😠
Eat out to help out
He didn't apologise cause he made mistakes, he's sorry cause he got caught.
What about our private lives.
Hopefully next time we see him will be summoned to court.
LOL
There's 2 people on that video. The trollop should resign as well for the same reasons
BJ couldn't sack him cos it would have been hypocritical, by resigning it sort of says I broke the rules and obviously BJ did as well, along with all the indiscretions.
Keep your brain in your head not your underpants.
Great ! So can we prosecute him for breaking data protection laws and gdpr laws for leaking the entire NHS database to the police back end of 2020 ? Or is he getting away with this also ?
Do as they do not as they say.
About bloody time
He’s got off lightly by resigning in this way. Still needs holding to account for all of the extra unnecessary deaths his work is responsible for.
His protective arm was f***ING invisible
If people think him resigning is going to stop our tyranical government imposing more lockdowns & destroying our lives day by day, then they are VERY much mistaken 🙄
Cummings taking out the trash. He can now save lives at home 😂😂
The tax payer will continue funding a very comfortable life for him
Good riddance to the useless, hopeless hypocrite.
Get over it lol 😂
Exactly news 🤞🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What a news !!!!!!!!!! OMG so happy!!!!!!!!!!
FANNY,AND A 💩HEAD
Finally!
He made the point in the first minute and just repeated himself for 15 minutes
Goodbye Matt, thanks for all the laughs
Wander Who is next to take on this poison chalice! 😦
Better late than never
He will still be making huge profits of this COVID scheme trust me.
Best news I've heard all year, the piece of s**t
See ya handycock 👍
Spicy
Bye bye 😅👍👏
Good ridence he needs prosecution for crimes against humanity...
Vile toad
RAT 🐀
He is rotten to his core
Hancock will be missed like a dose of the clap
Dont let him off the hook, he has a lot more to answer for.
Everyone man saying awful would not turn down advance from v attractive woman, or any woman tbh. Every woman has used that ‘weakness’ at some time in her life too. That’s called being a bloke, our brains are guess where .......
😁
There are idiots, idiots and then IDIOTS....and Hancock is an IDIOT.
Who cares it's all theatre!!!  Don't take the vaccine!
Look at him gross
Good bye to that genocidal, now Nuremberg trials.
LESSGOOO
Im sorry this post didn’t go right for him and in my opinion he has done the honourable and required  thing in the current situation..personally I think he has done some valuable work …I wish him well for the future .
Covid liars got what he deserves
Happy new year now he's gone
Let's not get too excited.  The next Health Secretary will come in and break the same rules.
not a minute to soon vile horrible little man , he has made millions out of his job hope his wife takes him for every penny she can
pos
Don't celebrate too much, he's only going to be replaced by somebody equally incompetent
Hoooray hooray good boris should resign too and transport secretary vantam witty and all the rest of the cronies
Good riddance, now f*** off
He needs to get jail time for crimes against humanity
Just imagine how many contracts the have given out to there friends in millions tories are cheaters  motherfucker scumbags
HOT HANCOCK SUMMER😈🥶
Yes indeed he has build back better for his own pocket. He should be struck off completely from politics. Back bencher for what ?
He'll be seen unshaven with a carrier bag of cheap wine by monday. 🤣🤣🤣
LOL
Did his last paycheck come in before he decided to resign? Oh that's good for him then.
The letter that was written out for him
One down many more to go,its about time piss poor Patel was gone.
All planned I think to get him out of the public spotlight before people start dropping like flies.
About time the little weasel
Yeah really he resigned over breach of covid rules ,,he resigned for being caught with his pants down and his little pecker out . Now the time to delve into his bank accounts and his official dodgy dealings with contracts to friends and family 😡😡🤬🤬
Jumped before pushed to save face
And he ends his apology with a WEF slogan “build back better”
She is not even beautiful , how could he kiss her in covid. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Best news ive heard in a long time
Shagger has left the building! I have seen septic tanks that are less full of sh*t than him. Go cry me a river...
The bint must go also
Not a chance that he isnt still going to be in the background making more awful decisions this is nothing but a pr stunt
Surprise surprise jumped ship before he can be held accountable for his incompetence. Distrust the government Avoid the media Fight the lies Www.vernoncoleman.com Www.carlvernon.com Www.hugotalks.com
Oh beg my pardon a marvellous job that should read  I do apologise
Disgusting little man
What an absolute flog....
No, I’m sorry but he doesn’t get to act magnanimous or apologetic when he has been pressured into resigning, he should have resigned or better yet been sacked yesterday, but of course how can the Czar of corruption and sleaze that is Johnson possibly do that to anyone else.
So he's resigning so he doesn't have to stick to the rules he set 😂🤣  He should have worded that better
No apology to his family or wife 👀👀👀 interesting
THE MAN WHO WRECKED A NATION .
Needs a fuckin slap
Disgrace hypocrite
Still pretending it's his private life, not admitting to what he's done with taxpayers money at work Boris should resign too. Should've sacked him. Also it's not over til we know that cheating woman has lost her job too
Imagine your financial situation improving from the pandemic. That's the conservative cabinet
He didn't just let the country down by breaking the guidelines, he let the country down for not acting sooner on the virus
He should have been fired ages ago
Malignant narcissist, smirking now cause he’ll make millions on the back benches.
Yeah! Brilliant news, go hide your head in shame
Can't wait to see what Spitting Image have to say abut this lol
YIPPEEEE
He should have been fired, also the rest of them should, followed by a full investigation and court case
How long before he defends actions by saying they both done covid tests before any sexual contact.
Wow! Shocker! Glad to see it happen.
I mean the fact this guy has been the health secretary for this long is insane. How in the world did he manage to stay in after repeatedly messing up?
It later emerged that Gina was on her knees while Matt was delivering this apology
as given himself a contract before he goes, so deep is the corruption expectation
GOOD  !!!  HIPOCRITA!!!
Taxpayer's money shouldn't be paid for your kissing, sorry Matt.
No way he's going to get away that easily!!! He can run but he can't hide!
Good riddance to a bad rubbish, but he is set for life. There should be a criminal investigation about him giving  contracts and  jobs to mates. His boss, useless liar Boris should be next to go.
I am truly believe, that it is way more to it , and I don’t believe in a slightest that he didn’t know that cameras are there ???!  Nah , something else is going on !!!
He’s a worm!! Disgusting individual…I can’t say anything nice. Actually I can?! Now your free Mrs Hancock have the time of your life..!!
Hand cock by nature.. Hand cock by name.. Lolol
The man had no choice, this is not about the social distancing or private life. This is about pure corruption. His bit on the side,s husband is involved in NHS contracts, as is her father. She is a millionaire and why take up a role as a secretary for £15,000 job. UNLESS it was to make their affair easier to continue. THIS HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER along with all the other corruption
Thank God he's gone.
retirement fund must be nice and fat now.
Haha 😂
As if he didn't know where the CCT cameras where in the office, he couldn't have stood in a better spot !
Lesson learnt. Don't cheat.
Hahahahanahahahahahahaha Excuse me Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Good Riddance ..Now let's Go out  And Celebrate.....
Ahahahahahahhahahahaahahahahahaha
Hancock has eventually resigned for breaching the rules. WHY IS BURLEY STILL WORKING FOR SKY NEWS .com. TOTAL HYPOCRITES
Hancock is a member of The World Economic Forum, he was part of the creative destruction of the whole system so they can “build back better” with a new world order
He will be back under a different guise prob with a peerage ....... Teflon Tony keeps popping up.
Im probably the only one that didn't want him to resign
Can look forward to next health secretary to moan about now.        Ms Footmuff.
He obviously knew there is CCTV in his office and then he did what he did in front of it. So is according to plan.
https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?EVENTS=on&PAGENO=1&PERPAGE=10&ESORT=&REVERSESORT=&VAX=(COVID19)&VAXTYPES=(COVID-19)&DIED=Yes
Makes no difference AT ALL they'll just replace him with another c--t
Shame, I think generally he did a good job.
Cock by name cock by nature!!!
Rest assured whoever replaces him will be even more horrific its the cults way
So the Criminal Bojo the Clown had marked to take the fall for Covid resigns. Guess He gonna have to ear mark a new Criminal to take the Covid Fall now then.
We just need boris next and then we can get back to normality
Rats and sinking ship comes to mind
L
LOL
time to take the nhs out of the hands of private criminals or they just find another low life like hancock ..time to get back to the real normal not their normal
Really couldn't give a 💩 The real news is the hundreds of thousands of the general public who are  protesting for our civil liberties and human rights now on the streets of London. WHERE IS YOUR COVERAGE SKY?
This guy is awful, why are we listening to a single word?
🤣🤣🤣
Thank god
the Right Honourable Matt Hancock.................what a joke.............he just got caught having an affair behind his wife's back!!! When's the divorce?
Now get him charged and locked up.
Good riddance
How can Boris say proud what is don't help kill people in care homes that's what Boris intended to do in the first place needs arresting the whole cabinet and the House of Lords and the House of Commons need to face Justice for all the deaths in this country
We don’t need a farewell speech just piss off!
What a bellend
National party across the United Kingdom.
Can Boris pass off too?
All planned all along, if people can’t see this they never will, he’s just moving on to the next phase of the World Economic Forums campaign, he’s done his job and the damage that he was supposed to and he’s going to make silly amount of money doing it. He’ll be doing after dinner speeches for years reaping the profits for what he’s done to this country!
I love how he did everything possible to not apologise
He ain't smirking anymore 👍
Good, but the revolving door of cretins will replace him with another CONservative.
Before he can b sacked..worm wriggling
Hopefully a competent and trustworthy replacement will be appointed.
Isn't it ironic ! the health Secretary bet he feels sick now 🤧.   These are the people we have to put our trust in when all the while he's cheating and lying not only to his wife but the world , there is no trust with these people  ....
About time too Mr Handycock....I mean Hancock.
Is she also resigning though? Seems unfair otherwise
HURRAY HURRAY HURRAY HURRAY.  Better late than NBEVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOOOOOOOO YEAA BABYYYYY!!!!! THATS WHAT WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!! WOOOOOOO!
Boris won't be far behind him. Country is run by idiots.
This fool should be in Scrubs - the Wormwood variety. Simply resigning is getting off lightly.
Here we go again...  Another politician that thinks he can dupe us with a late apology.  He is only apologising now because he got caught.
Good....Now crawl off the die some where
Good riddance
YES GET IN. I FEEL LIKE THAT GUY IN THE TRUEMAN SHOW AT THE END WHEN TRUEMAN ESCAPES FROM THE FAKERY 🤙😂😂
As planned and aided by msm...nothing to see here
Bloody prat
Alex belfied 1-0
His wife gonna be looking for revenge....
He needs to jailed he lied him and boris stolen public funds
Mat Cock has resigned good! Time to enjoy the millions earned through the vax programe!
About time, should've been sacked a year ago as Cummings said. Better late than never I guess.
Hope he still gets his day in court for crimes against humanity We will not forget his treachary and filling his pockets and friends as well
he is a shifty , greasy little worm , good riddance .
I don't trust this for a minute. Everyone responsible for this murderous scam needs to be tried and punished in a court of law. Nuremberg 2.0 needed.
Fantastic news chow matt
Boris to resign next please..the wrong man in the wrong job at the wrong time
HERE HERE 🙌🙌
Boris out next for supporting that despicable creature Hancock.
Nothing but a distraction,  we need to fight now for our lifes or is it over, they are planning another lockdown in a few weeks.
He served his purpose.
Come on. It was only a quick finger blast.
Will be replaced by others who will continue to follow the orders of their Rothschild masters.
Just need Boris to resign now. People don’t realise- this is done on purpose and people lap it up
He's a vile lying little weasel who has been front and centre in destroying our country
Another corrupt incompetent out, so many more to get rid of.
We didn’t rise for COVID restrictions they were forced upon us
Now we need to get rid of the rest of the other clowns
Not before time. Slimebag.
Asshole.
Staged, another puppet will take his place.
I knew this was coming so bloddy predictable! This was his get out all along! This doesn't mean he escapes justice for his crimes against humanity!!
Reading alot of comments below... Alot of Ppl don't get it... He still will be an mp, still able to vote on matters related to this country. He didn't do the decent thing at all! He just got out of the way, hoping that the heat will eventually go somewhere else.
If we ignore the fact he broke rules, he still had an affair. Utter Bellend
BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT, BORIS NEXT
He is Hancock for a reason 🤣
Should have been sacked.
" Matt , it's Boris , what's her number " 😅
FINALLY!!!!    He was terrible he should face prosecution like the rest of us have
He has made his millions, no tears from him😏
and I thought I'd had a bad week
THE BBC SADLY ANNOUNCES THAT HANCOCKS HALF HOUR WILL END TODAY AFTER 4 YEARS OF COMEDY !! The BBC WISHES HANCOCK AND HIS BITA NOOKIE THE BEST FOR THE FUTURE AND THEY ARE SURE THE TWO FACED LYING  HYPOCRITICAL TOAD WELL
He lose being back bencher too
Straight to the house of Lords for a cushy number
GOOD RIDDANCE
If he was invested in crypto he will be well off anyway and won’t need to work again
He's made a fortune, no punishment here for Upper class twit of the year !
Yes this is very good not put him in jail
I have to say people on here are complete hypocrites. They are screaming from the roofs about him breaking guidance's (I am NOT a fan of Hancock or all this bollocks) yet I bet all of them have broken the guidance's in this shamdemic.
Bet he's leaving a richer man with all that tax payers money he had control of..🤔
I'm dudin' up my shirt front, Puttin' in the shirt studs, Polishin' my nails, yakkadeedah yakkadeedah!!! 😁
Should have been sacked.
Another distraction. Wake up. Corona has been around for years and no jab until recently😂 wake up! NWO the reset
He does not deserve that role any more he has broken the rule he made
I didnt think he would make a good choice durin his career.. but hes proven me wrong.
good bye, good riddance
It’s not just about his private life though is it! He was doing this during his work hours whilst being paid by the public. What about his deceit and corruption?!
All politicians are dodgy as f___k!!
😆 🤣 😂 😂 the little weasel got wats coming lol he is a fraud .never cared about the people. Giving friends contracts and kisses 😘 💕  😆 🤣
Bye
Who cares…
Good to see he was 100% focused on the job in hand......
Seems in the UK there's a price to pay for grabbing them by the pussy
Now he can concentrate on working with WEF with this build back better bollocks  something sinister afoot awaiting in the wings .by the wat hes still lying
Not a minute too soon!
I think this is set up, did he not know about the camera FFS
They are not arsed. This will be old news soon enough
One down. Several more to go! Who’s next? Boris please! GO! GO! GO! GO!
was probably all planned anyway, how stupid does he have to be to do it next to a cctv camera
Finally some good news 😂
He's the only one to resign because of the bullshit he's done. I hate the guy but fair play. I know it's because he was caught but there were so many others who didn't resign
Who will merde-ock go for next?
Should be sacked and not ever aloud to work in government
That bird he snoggd...played him nicely....what a fool...
Now arrest him for crimes against humanity.  He will not get away with it.
FINALLY! after over 100,000 murders, and millions in the pocket, he's fully rinsed this country of everything it had. good riddance. nothing will happen to him, either way her better start running before investigations start properly
Should have gone ages ago. The Tory government set a very low bar in terms of competence, honesty, integrity, but Hancock was pretty useless, even for a Tory.
One down, five to go.
Don't let this weasel vanish.
Yea..🎉🎉🎉 couldn't happen to a nicer weasel...sorry mean man..😂😂
Hahaha hahaha! Who believes he resigned due to an office snog, considering the S*it they have put people through?  He has pocketed his money, people are waking up I am out. I wonder who will replace him........
byyyyeeeeeeeeeeee
Best news Britian has had in long time. Whitty next 🤞
Matt it is “our NHS” 🤣
Parasite should be in prison
Best news this year he was nothing but a waste of space he can now go and have more affairs
This is all in the plan this is what was supposed to happen on to the next phase
if this is a pandemic then we've been in a pandemic for the past 1000's of years, no more deaths this year or last year than any other. I wonder now that most have been vaxxed whether its going to be the vaxxed or unvaxxed getting sick
👍 to the sun for reporting this affair and can the person that leaked the photo be on the 2021 honours list.
Now lock him up. :-(
Pity it’s not for all the deaths his incompetence caused
Lets not forget Boris didn't want to sack him
Finally some good news
Alot of lip service both in the apology and digression.
He was kicked out in such a disgraceful way  which he deserved may be ,,,!
Lol. He’s an Actor ffs. Run by Cabal
🍆
Good riddance
He can't plea for privacy for his private life now, when he - single handedly - interfered in the private lives of every pleb in this country. I wouldn't get that sympathy if I had 7 people in my house!
Johnson next
He'll have more time for tongue probing now, and to profit from all the contracts he's dished out.
Hee has yeah!!! Hes gone!  Next, ROBERT JENRICK, THEN BORIS JOHNSON!  #TORIESOUTNOW!!!!!
Resigned so he can keep necking on
Dipping your bread in someone else's gravy comes (!) with repercussions  He'll have no problem social distancing now 😅
Good.
Good riddance yer pillock!
aw thats sad, can i get hired? ez gyal tbf
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In the end it was the kiss of death - but more so for those who died from covid thanks to this mans lack of ability.
Epstein & McAfee didn't kill themselves & Prince Andrew abused underage girls !!! Report some real news . This guy is a waste of space.
Now Hancock should resign his seat. He has no business in politics.
excellent news
BLOODY GOOD NOW BORIS NEEDS TO GO !!!!!!
Whopp whoop PARTY OVER HERE 🎊🎊🎉😎😎🍾🎊🎂BEST NEWS OF THE PLANDEMIC.... Now he has all the time in the world to cheat with his strange small headed assistant. GOOD RIDDANCE!!!
Young matty been snootching around
My dad always said “ if it looks like a weasel, if it sounds like a weasel, if it acts like a weasel…….. then it’s safe to say it’s A FUKKIN WEASEL!” On another note, who released the footage? I reckon the got paid a pretty penny for it too 😂😂
I guess Malcolm tucker paid him a visit
Finally some good news
So BJ read the headlines, saw which way the wind was blowing and got rid of the rat. If only we had a PM with the will to make a decision without consulting that morning's headlines. Pathetic shower of shyte.
considering how many extra deaths his dept is reponsible for, and how many contracts he's profited from without scrutiny, he's gotten off lightly.
If he is willing to breach the rules. I think this proves how seriously he is taking C19.
What a Han cock...
Lol
PINNOCHIO is gone
Cummings is delighted i guess. Don't ever come back Hancock.
Don't believe a word of it. Just another smokescreen. People are getting too close to the real truth. Its a shame he isn't held responsible for  killing thousands in care homes and awarding contracts to his pals. Dont believe a word of it
He could see the pitchforks coming.
Haha bout time .little slap head, next Boris then that lizard Whitty 👍🏻
First act of the replacement health secretary: Lift all restrictions.
Staged
Not the end. This fool and his cronies need to face jail time
He was just a mouthpiece, being replaced by another
the perfect cover up doesnt exi- good job lads youve done it yet again wouldnt want to be in the field when shits about to go down
Did the RIGHT THING!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Today is a glorious day!
He should not have been given the option to resign he should have been sacked
Great.  Now take him to court.
Thank god finally 🥳 this is the best news I have heard since the pandemic started! 🥳
Best news ever. He won’t be missed.
these people are so weird. do your job terribly: doesn’t resign. bad pr: resigns
Now it's Boris's turn
🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳final something good comes out of this crap , I might have a party and invite 30 of my friends 🤪🤪🤪
Can we send him to prison now then ?
For the love of god, who cares?
Finally!
Thats one gone,next
Finally... One of them has some honor. This "build back better" thing from the mouths of all the bigwigs worldwide is starting to worry me...
this is honestly the best thing that could have happened
Finally Get lost
He should be in jail.I cannot believe how the majority are buying this story with this so called “afair”
Disgusting. In the offices of health and social care..... People in that sector are struggling more than ever and instead of getting it sorted, he's living up to his surname.
Woohooooooooooo!!! GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good  riddens about time this clown has mad a mess of everything his been involved in
BJ at this moment is partying in the garden of No10.
6uild 6ack 6etter
Media and government knew about this long ago but never exposed it so that the June 21st deadline could be extended .
now apologize to your wife matt
So how did the Sun obtain this?
Wow he actually did the right thing............under intense pressure from others and the public. I am sure otherwise he would not have done.
yeh build back better for them, not for us.
He’s made his millions and advanced the agenda, this is no punishment.
Rightly so. People have committed suicide, Developed life changing depression/anxiety. Families have lost decades of work because their self made businesses  haven’t been able to cope. If anything Matt Hancock has been let off very lightly here.
put him in jail
He's a Master at incompetence.  90% of infected with "delta" variant have been vaxxed.  the only "variants" we are seeing are in the lies. Without censorship, the entire national "vaccine" genocide operations would collapse. avoid the "vaccines" at all costs, they are a gene weapon.
Johnson next
He resigned beacuse he fk ever one over with the covid stuff plus he was caught having an affair which broke 2 meter rule ooo wait its ok for him to brake rules
Was getting some stinky finger on the side worth it Matt? Lmaooo 🤣
I wonder what other psychopath is going to replace him
I almost thought, he has done the right thing, then he said he is staying on as a back bencher and also still lying about the the support to the nhs... He hasn't learnt a thing! Tories will never get my vote again
So they have had enough now then..
they're not concerned how many he murdered with lethal vaccines, but who placed the camera!  we know, it was MI6
ye this guy is weirdo
Why is having an affair a resigning offence but not presiding over 128k deaths
Don’t hug granny. But do cheat on ya wife 🤷🏻‍♂️
Just as planned! He will now dissappear with the millions he has made from our misery. What we really need is to see him and the rest of the mob brought to justice!
Knob head
Part of the plan don't be fooled
He could learn a thing or two from YouTube apologies.
There is a god. Bye!
that tyrant should be in jail, along with bojo. Anyone who steals another persons freedom needs to be locked up for life
What goes around comes around....Karma
This needs to be a national holiday!
Good now arrest him
Should have been sacked .
Finally!!! Hancock has finally realised that his time is up.
Wohhooooooo
Im having a party
Hear that folks it's GUIDANCE
We now need a Sage scientist to make sure the next lockdown is swift and certain! No fussing about! Ready for Autumn Lockdown!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 As for social care the British public have broad shoulders to bear higher taxes!! 👍🏻👍🏻
Great. Now if Johnson, Starmer and Zahawi could follow suit we might be able to get some politicians running the Tories and Labour who actually care about Liberty
He should be ashamed on so many levels! He's a Disgrace
So the evil one has gone
Wahey!!!!!
Hip, Hip, Hooray! One > hits the dust! No, what about the crime he committed, on our pensioners!, criminal and should be made a crime!!! PM, was NOT going to sack him! Boris, should go next, blundering idiot!!!!
We still need to investigate the contracts granted to that woman‘s brother.
who will the next murderer be?
Hope this is the start , Drain the swamp  Dirty evil people .
So this is how happiness feels like. Beautiful feeling.
he still shouldnt get away with    a neuremberg trial with the rest of them....time to bring the curtain down on these criminals once and for all
Good riddance ...Total efing Liar.now needs jailing
Best new I heard all year
They don't follow their own rules because they know it's a scam.
Lost his Job, Wife, family and respect of his friends in less than a week.   But, on the plus side, i found a euro under the couch!!
Good ,he's one of the Schwab's men.
wonder how many ppe contracts that cost him.
Resigns on a lovely £50k a year pension and straight into a cushy job with one of his mates on a several million pound contract no doubt. Don't be surprised if he doesn't show up as the NHS chairman.
Good to hear hes gone what a discussing humanbeing best news of the whole pandemic.
☺️❤
Yippedy doo daa 😃
That fumble was staged, they think we're completely thick
Good riddance he is an outright liar, cheat and theif.
Yay! I hope the replacement is a step up
Without Matt Hancock, we all will suffer. He's the reason why the vaccine has made it's way around the UK. He tried his best and he should not be insulted.
This is a blessing for all humanity.
This is not his private life, this is what he does at work.
I hope the police will visit him
Not before time.
Now can he be interviewed  by the Met please? Questions  need answers now.
Why did it take so long??
Another bell end next of course
The Bell End has gone thank feck for that.
All the people watched there family die from a distance while he's taking the piss
Would have looked better on BJ if he'd fired him instead of lamely accepting his apology.
All staged of course
When is he gonna start doing interviews against his own cabinet too then?
There is no law that he has broken!
"not giving into temptation"....I'd say he gave in :)
If I had had the vaccines I would be livid right now. Lied to by the Health Secretary. How bad was covid for anyone under 65 and no underlying health issues. Get the country open from tomorrow 27th June. Matt Hancock has proved how farcical it has all been for the wider people. He should face court for lying and breaking the rules he helped create.
And there was I thinking the matter was closed 😂
Tinterhooks be ok
Nuremberg 2 next please it’s the only way to be sure
Yikes. 😵‍💫
This country and the government are laughing stock what with the  corrupt over zealous egotistical Police force and the lefty liberal baffoons leading this country it’s time to make a stand enough is enough.
LMFAOOOOO
Boris I give my full backing of matt Hancock the matter is closed  next day he resigns
Hancock has resigned !!!! 😢. I’ll get the card for everyone, so if everyone can muster round a collection, that’ll be great! There will be a party but don’t worry bout Covid reg’s as this gov doesn’t follow them anyway. Gavin Williamson tops to be new health sec. He’s totally qualified. 😂
Deleted once   charge him with murder for working depopulation stooges
Hope Boris is next..
Hallelujah ! He sees the light …what an arrogant hypocrite
If we break the rules we go to jail.
Best news of 2021 🥳🥳
The worst Health Secretary the last 75 years
He should of been sacked borris is week
Bye Bye nocock 😂🤣
And so he should .He should be tried for Treason And Genoside and crimes against Humanity ..
Finally, Matt Hancock officially resign as Heath Ministry aka Secretary Of Health.
Oh, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive!" The man is a total idiot!
Yeeessssss!!! Finally his own BS caught up with him. Off with his head I say!!!  Now the aide needs to be sacked also!!  Boris needs to go NEXT!!
Yereeeeeee
Good
Jokes aside but Mat Hancock is actually a really good kisser😂
Finally a sky news video I can throw a like on 😁
BONE BACK BETTER.
People have affairs all the time? He didn’t need to resign
*Good bye, the Cock!
He would have been better off just doing one and not bothered with a hollow fair well message. He should be arrested
what a shame - Hancock paid for a kiss and Boris did not yet pay for aggressive military provocation in Crimea
Good
He needs to be sitting in the dock at Nuremberg . . . the same for the rest of them.
I wish I was a drinker cos I’d celebrate so I’m having a cup of ☕️ great news, Hancock, smarmy little git.
More face's than the town hall clock.
About time.
Hallelujah 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Oh no what am I going to do is ruin my whole day here in America oh no maybe I should just run away
Good stuff
Now there will be a new health secretary for everyone to loathe.
Yeeha! That awful free burger cost him more than he imagined.
Matt Hancock meets a woman for the first time
HAHAHA!   Britain is a joke and a laughing stock 🤣
He resigned for the deaths of the care home residence in my view and not for shagging about with a dirty sket. Also why has It taken so long for the footage to come to light stinks of a cover up attempt
He can spend more time on his hobbies now.
The guy is a total “Cock”!
A new flame with a big pay day round the corner. He’ll probably live the remainder of his life in the Bahamas
Of course he did. He filmed that footage himself as a way to escape the sinking ship. His ticket out and a chance to flee with the millions he's swindled out of taxpayers through dodgy contracts
Good!
now he can sell us out to the world economic forum from behind the scenes without public scrutiny
What an idiot, blamed the nation for the spread of covid, meanwhile he was having fun with another women, what a bloody joke
Still managed to get a build back better in there ,this is all part of it
😂😂😂 Matthew
He needs arrested for making his mates rich, trust me he will be getting millions into his accounts over the next few years.
Yaaaaay, should have resigned for his corona blunders but this will do🎊🎊🎊🎉
Good 4 him
A name like Hancock ought to work for an insurance company.
Best news in a long time! He fell on his own sword, I thought we never could get rid of him….
It's all part of there plan am I not surprised....
Byeeee Imagine your job out if your hand so quickly 🏃🏾‍♀️
Good news
Wheeyyyyyy
O no
Should of been sacked !!!!
Fuckin 🐆🐆
Blimey
there's a surprise
Good
This made my year.
🥴🥴
About time
Hahahahhaahha
Best news all year
