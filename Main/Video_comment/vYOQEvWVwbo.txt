Great video!
Big thank you, Cole! We look forward to your enthusiasm.  And...we can't wait to see your family in a safe family home.
You should put plywood sheats about 10-15 feet from flor so if you want screw something on wall you dont need to search for 2x4 under wall
1:40 Sounds like the same tech used to keep the barrel of the Abrams tank level
Cole make a mold of the good roof section ,use that to fix the bent ones
on 01/27/2023
the mailman stole my raycons was going to get them today but the package way empty  someone please help i am pissed
That needed a “That’s not going anywhere” after you tugged on the load straps.
That ain’t goin no where
You guys should get a mini excavator
I agree for goodness sake fix the railings before you loose your dad over the bin site.  Please . Hes irreplaceable x
Have you worked on the upstairs yet.  How is wiring and plumbing going in the house.
He took all his corner bracing off 😅. Wait till next big wind storm
Can't wait to get my earbuds ordered 2 pair. Thanks Cole and the family yall are awesome 👌
If you are going to remove the cross bracing you may want to install plywood behind your metal sheeting. The metal sheeting does not provide adequate shear strength that you require. Could be problematic if with your insurance if the building gets wind damaged.
Good thing you are not hog farmers, because you would not want to throw your purlins before swine.
So glad your videos are back. Please tell us about the new baby and how you and Nave are doing being parents.
Cool stuff always 😎
Looking good. Stay warm and safe.
Cole what happened to Nave I haven't seen her in your video in a  while also haven't seen any new video from her.
Glad to see you back Cole.
I wouldn't show the moving of the head stones in front of 400,000 people it's a little disrespectful
Can't wait to see it it finished
Thanks Cole and all the Cornstar people!
RAYCON does not work for me.   My wife does not understand how I can listen to two different radio broadcast at the same time and be reading news on the internet, without loosing my train of thought.   They RAYCON does not let me listen to two different broadcast at the same time. Putting the bent corners on the bottom will not impede their function.  You use a ball-peen hammer to get a better fit.
Lmao he never do anything right he always breaking something
I really miss Nave in your videos.  😪
You use 2 forklifts to load lumber like that one on the front side of the fender and one on the back side of the fender.
Oh darn!! I thought you were going to work on the inside of your house when I saw all the wood on the trailer. Oh well. Maybe soon.
He dropped them….. give me a new stack of roofing
Cole should start a poll.  What will happen more in 2023, number of dead dogs, number of people who fall off the bin site, or times Cole breaks down in tears.
💗🐾
ceiling is purlins, walls are girts. I hope you come up wit a plan to replace the x bracing, those help hold your building square in the wind, horizontal girts wont be strong enough
Actually Cole the diagonal braces are code and are required for structure integrity on a pole barn, it is part of what give a  pole barn resistance in high winds .
Awesome video Cole.
As a semi driver who runs flatbed out of Williamsburg Iowa that strap job made me happy since you actually tied the excess up correctly 😂
Yes, I agree on that youtubers follow, donate, subscribe, buy merchandise, etc. because they feel the things that you have shared in the past from all of your family--Cooper graduating, funeral preparations at grave sites, grandma and grandpa visits, DC stories of when he was a teenager, Momma CS giving haircuts, birthday parties, 4th of July celebrations, Christmas tree shopping, going on vacation with Nave having fun, Nave learning to drive grain cart, etc..now all of the sudden Nave and yourself are having a baby and, or did have, a baby, and suddenly everything is mute. She is still a good person isn't she Cole? A baby should bring joy to everyone. That's fine if you don't want to share the news, but then why did you start your channel with all the personal stuff mentioned above and expect your subscribers and buyers just to be quiet and don't comment.. One thing about DC, he's a straight shooter no matter what has happened in his life.
Those cross bracing are required and are an architectural element called shear bracing. The interior tin may be considered a shear bracing element, but an architectural review should be done to satisfy local codes and insurance compliance.
Hey Cole give up the goods where's Neva. she had that baby yet
Thanks for the tip with the soil probe.  I never thought of drilling it first to get through the hard stuff on top.
When digging graves, why don't you use a dump trailer to haul the skidder and move the dirt?
Seek therapy.
Please for the love of your family stop going on the bins.  They are super unsafe and if someone fell off of then it would truly be tragic.  Keep people off the bins until they are fixed.
Removing diagonal bracing is an example of a little knowledge is more dangerous than having no knowledge.
You r the next Mrbeast..after Ryan and airrack
Nice video cole. Glad you didn’t get hit by that sliding tin! See ya soon!
I could care less!
Punch that thumbnail in the face 🤜
They are called Girts  buddy 👌
Rich kids rants......don't recommend this channel
Hey Cole you been busy changing diapers 😂? You ashamed to talk about the baby 😢?
Cute puppy😍 how Nave? Hope everything is well
That forklift operator is not very skilled....
Going to be nice with all the white tin inside there looming at the foam when you take the braces off shows how dirty it can get iside the shop
I heard that music and thought I was watching SAILING into FREEDOM with Plukky instead of CTCS....weird
I am finally done watching Cole the CON star !!!!!!
I thought you guys got a new back hoe
2nd time Cole has won at hand wrestling. He learned the secret...weaker opponents.
Plus it goes against building code if I’m not mistaken Cole google importance of wind bracing in post frame buildings but probably not that windy there so shouldn’t be a problem
They are girts the 45 degree boards are WIND BRACING whoever told you it’s not needed they are wrong unles you have sheathing on outside under siding your siding provides little to no wind bracing or no structural you need the diagonal wind bracing you’ll see Cole in time you could replace with a cable and turn buckle at opposite corners but 4 is better than 2
Imagine being this special fella with that thumbnail and known as the Cornstar.  What is YouRube thinking recommending this trash?
Cole I hope y’all get y’all some climbing gear for when y’all are up on those vans so if you fall, you won’t have a 50 foot fall to the ground and also fix the railing. I just hate to see one of y’all get hurt up there grace and peace.
The shop will look awesome when it is done
I'm no engineer, but believe those diagonal braces are structural for the building's wind load and I'm wondering if the horizontal replacements would offer the same level of protection...
“Dead center “. No pun intended
Come on cole is it a boy or a girl.  We all want to no. I'm happy for you guys.  I no your worried about what ppl are going to say cause you not married.  Well so what. Your in love and happy that's Al the yy
Cole: The diagonal braces you cut out prevent racking of the building from end to end, resistance to wind don't you know. You will note there are diagonal braces adjacent to the overhead door. Buildings are engineered in a given manner, you changed the engineering, if you have problems maybe similar to your bin issues. Good luck.
So exactly where did you almost cut your toes off?  Just another clickbait title and description.
No to be rude but it would of been better to bring the deck over trailer to pick up the materials so u don’t have to worry about fenders in your way.
Great video.
Cole. I say this with the deepest respect. You are loosing subscribers cause you talk too much nonsense. Keep it real. Cut out all the fast talking BS. I do love the videos. I don't miss any. I just feel you need to keep the content real.  Too much joking chit-chat.
Too many commercials!
Maybe a nice 3 yard mason dump would be nice for the graveyard operation would cut down on the trips to dump the soil
nice job.
Cole - Did you go skying this winter??
I've been learning about regenerative agriculture and soil building, and wonder who the soil agronomist was that Cole mentioned listening to.  Thanks for all your good videos Cornstar Family!
You might as well put in some more insulation before you tin it there is room and you won’t be able to do it later 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why dont you all ue a little mini excavator as many as u all dig???? It would have to be faster.....
The long angled 2x10s are intended to stop the building from racking end to end during high winds
I was wondering if there are people who actually watch these videos, these types of videos are trending in the most watched ones Nobody can interfere in anyone's life!definitely, probably, I suppose, I guess there's a chance I'll be a trend someday?
Oh yes please fixx
If something large and heavy is starting to fall...just get out of the way and let it fall. Don't try to catch it. That's how injuries happen!
Weirdly enough, you have to call a plumber for the gas line.
21-01-2023.Hello Cole, you seem to have dropped weath, have you given any thouth about those fish ponds at the end of the rain water ditchs , say hello to all for me.Freezing cold in Germany.
I know that red heeler. His name is Red.
Please never let that puppy be watched by anyone else but family again.  He's too precious and cute.  Wow, Cole, that wood must have cost a hundred thousand dollars or so. 😃
Short and sweet video!  Glad you're moving forward with the farm improvements!
Pretty farm what about fixing your silos? They look dangerous at the top. I’d be concerned about that. Oh you might have the prettiest and neat
Anyone who’s over-roaded a front end loader knows how bad the bounce can get. The float feature on newer stuff lets you go 35 with a full load now.
girts on wall purlins on roof
One word... "dunnage"
purlins on the roof, girts on the walls...
I am happy to see the puppy with you two.  I think having her around is helping DC heal from Anna being gone. ❤❤
Watching you guys dig at these cemeteries really has stop & made Me think.   I can’t imagine how hard it is for these really crowded cemeteries I’ve seen around home.    When you go to a funeral you don’t stop & think about the actual gravesite & who dug the hole or where the excess dirt it.   So thank you for educating me on that.
COLE with those earbuds, you need to listen to David Straight about what an American Statenational  is and LAND PATENTS (Ron Gibson) the real and superior title. (No property tax) You dont  own your land, car, house, nothing.  UNITED STATES IS A CORPORATION.  Title 28 USC 3002 15a. Which  US citizens are slaves under.  Citi= municipal zen= servant.(Blacks Law Dictionary legalese) Search what your STRAWMAN is.  Just here to wake any normies, that havent woke up from the matrix yet.  Thats just the tip of the icberg.  17=Q
The propane line should be low pressure, 5oz?? For a temporary hookup you could plumb in a hydraulic hose , check for leaks with soapy water, keep up good work!!!
It’s about time to come clean about getting married and having a baby Cole.
When placing steel on ceiling rent a sheet rock lifter. If you can find one that goes that tall/high
Purlins are the cross boards used on roofs.  Girts are the cross boards on the walls,  the ones you are installing now.
Hindsight is 20/20 next time put the steel down first
you need to build a new  garage/shop behind the house - framing/retrofitting will go fast
WHY DO YOUR DOGS HAVE NO TAIL ?
Thumbs down
Good job everyone
Not sure its a good idea pulling the X-Braces out of the walls......................
The next time you get a real blow you may wish that you didn't take that cross bracing down.
If you need in the future for a pickup of wood or tin like that just take a couple pallets with you so the forklift can set flush or just above the fenders and your golden
wait, so you mean that most skid steers doesn't have boom suspension?
"Dead enter" :) over top of the tomb stone. - no pun intended
What ever happened to Nave?
Removing those diagonal braces is a mistake, They prevent you building from racking.
The wall horizontals are girts !
"...have to be dead center" says Cole in a cemetery....oh ha ha.
How about your son? How he is doing?
The music sucks!
Are you going to service and repair the Backhoe? In videos of the summer the backhoe was leaking pretty bad
DeWalt 💪
Is Summer OK .. we never hear from her now ?
leave the old heater as a back up and tin up to it and paint the wood what ever color you chose for the walls
Put Pipe dope on gas pipe ends  .Wow how hard can it be .Make a map of pipe , what you need . And go to town and get it
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👀👀👀☕️☕️☕️👍👍👍🥃🥃🥃🍻🍻🍻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
i would NOT remove the diagonal wood as they add a ton of strength to the building in windy situations, and if you leave it behind the tin you'd never even see it.  I'd be willing to bet  that a structural engineer would have a cow if he saw you remove those.
Wow I don't do sports either I'm Mark!
Do every remodeling construction project on graph paper. Make sure you add that N arrow.
Good to see you Cole!
Gotta love it Cole. Good job.  Stay warm
Curious why you don't run the water drain from the furnace through the wall and outside? You'll get mold leaving it like it is, if it's not already started.
not the J.I.D TRANSITION, intot he VERITASIUM outro hahaha
We are a small town and a fairly large cemetery, but we have a mausoleum which holds the coffins until spring, my dad's coffin  had to be laid in it until spring when he died in December but that's Canada...we don't dig in the winter even for cremations and our cemeteries have trees and bushes and are beautiful..I noticed you don't have a place for cremations..a wall above ground..ours is also beautiful..3 walls, flower beds, seating area.
I may not be a pro, but when I redid my gas line I used the Pro Flex™ 1/2" x 25' CSST Flexible Gas Tubing, and if you were to leave more than needed you could rebook up to your new heat source, but the thing you want/ need to do if using it is you have to run a ground cable on it from the end to the other end then out to your grounding source. Just an idea there's a few ways you can do it, but just remember right before your furnace you'll want to come out from your furnace with normal black pipe I believe and run it to a T and have like a 6in pice capped off on the bottom of the t and have your flex gas line coming into it from the top. And that stuff is super simple to cut and what not.
What baby?? I think you all are reaching.
10:01 those are the girts. the angled pieces are knee braces- also called wind braces.. cause they brace. against wind. 😛 timber frame terms
A purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is a longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin, and common purlin.  Purlins also appear in steel frame construction. Steel purlins may be painted or greased for protection from the environment.
roof = purlins  walls=girts
Will you be at the national farm machinery show this year and what day?
Utilize the furnace for an air curtain for the big door. The tube heater will be you primary but the furnace will act as a quick recovery for when the door is opened.
where is Hneiva and the baby
The side 2 by 4’s are called girts
Bad idea to remove 'wind braces' so you can install 'gurts'.
I know you don't want to say it but the guy loading your trailer was a @#$_&.
Didn't know about a baby until now... Wow! Hope all is well with them if true. Anyway, I was just going to ask who the new puppy belonged to???
How is the house remodel coming?  Seems like you need a bedroom and bathroom completed for the family!
Should’ve used a deck over trailer for your building materials. Then no stacking and wrecking tin. Totally preventable.
Editing is great. How much raw footage do you start with before whittling it down to what’s posted?
If you call a Plumber,  and you know its True!  Call Steve Lavomoniare from Daaarrrtmotuh MA. He's on you tube.
Rent a scissor lift! No ladders!
Hi Ellie !  ❤
The horizontal member are called…… “Girts”.  And you won’t need the X bracing you removed until you need it!!!!   Which will be when you have high speed wind events…..   all buildings need X bracing for wind loads except for a “Moment Frame Design”.  If I were you I would reinstall some type of X bracing back like cable bracing in line with the columns which would be out of the way of the Girts.
Must be so awesome going into mud season and have all those tractors and cultivators and air seeders and bins and belts and conveyors and trucks and trailers and pizza freezer all set up to move right into planting season there Cole the Cornstar! Hi Nave! Hope you have enjoyed a wonderful start to 2023! -Bob...
Have you thought of putting the dirt in a dump truck or trailer and parking it at the cemetery then dumping the dirt in the grave afterwards. It would save many miles in the JCB.
Arnt the wall boards called gerts,?
I think it would be nice to have a family update at the end of all your videos.  I miss hearing stuff about Summer and Jay, Momma Cornstar, and especially Nave with the baby.  Everybody loves babies and I can't wait to see the little one.
Gives new meaning to "Dead Center".
"girt"
Set your lumber on the end of the trailer and block up the other end and bring the forklift around and lift up that end and push your lumber on. Saves the fenders of the trailer and stop that from happening.
Ya lost me from the beginning…slow down, very hard to follow you anymore.
⚒️🔨🛠
Another dog. Hopefully this one doesn't get hit.
When you were checking the tie down straps, you didn’t snap them and say “ that’s not going anywhere “🤷🏻‍♂️
Great video.  Do you have any timeline on when you might get back to the inside of the house?
Good to see the shop coming along and the care y’all take in everything you do god bless be safe
That's interesting at 2:20 mixing the old 480 Case hoe with the new skid loader .  They make a great team ! 👍
How about rippin apart the bin site.
You said ride control on your skid steer was neat…… For me, it is mandatory on my pay loader !
if you guys got a dump truck you could probably dump dirt faster at the cemetary.
Girts
🙋‍♀️❤
Should try and get sponsored by torque strap
Get yourself a black iron to 5/8in brass fitting and then run 5/8in copper from the black iron pipe to your furnace. Be sure and rehook your furnace exhaust with the PVC. When your meter install is done then set the furnace back into its place.
Those diagonals were the shear bracing for wind.  You need those.
Ok WHAT HAPPENED TO NAVE ???
Cool getting  shop tinned inside getten  er done
It was February and I forgot something in the house, left my truck running and my pup stood on the door lock! Lucky we were at home and my wife had the spare.
cole need to get up to speed on pole barn framing! perlins are for roofin. gerts are horizontal framin on posts!
Can't believe I watched a video of you wearing the same clothes u had on daddy's channel......keep earning that hard money lol
My pup watching Cole the cornstar
Why not have a truck at the side of the back hoe and load it all into the truck and move it in one trip.  Save churning up all the grass.  In the UK the digger arrives with a truck to load the soil in.  They arrive an hour before the funeral, dig the grave, hide around the corner while the funeral takes place, then right back after the mourners leave to fill the grave back in.  All done on one day basically within three hours start to finish.
Holy cow the puppy is gynormous!
You really should run diagonal steel, the shearing force of wind on a structure that large is incredible . It is a simple but effective way to transfer the energy.
Yeah cole what's with the no show for a month then not even an apology,you seem to forget we your audience put you where you are now so a little bit of acknowledgement would be appreciated,why not even a mention about the fact you got married or had a child or the fact that you profound to be a decent Christian person who stood in the house of the Lord to bear witness to your shotgun marriage is something your ashamed of which you will be accountable on your day of reckoning
Walls are called Girts and On the Roof they are Purlins.
cole you need the cross braces for wind load .put them back in
9:09 - Dude (Austin?) in the background wearing a muscle shirt like it's summertime.  LOL
That’s the worst forklift operator I have seen and looks like rush to get loaded.
Lots of improvements and shop will be so nice
👍👍👍👍
Put frost teeth on.  The tigar  teeth style.  I can dig through frost in the road north of u.  The teeth don't last long but for your application it would pay off
Are we taking bets on how long it will take for the puppy to meet it's demise?
roof purlins and wall girts
I already have Raycons ( blue also ) love them ,also have speaker and headset
You’ll regret removing the cross bracing
Baby update?
The guy loading you sure doesn’t know much apparently.
30 years ago  it was $7300  for a nice shop and $1200 cash to put it up in 3 days time .30x70 and 12 feet tall .
Do you have any plans to work on the inside of your house.
Keep blowing that money ….
Hope this goes better than the bin site disaster
All this mans videos have turned into clickbait 😂
I helped my best friends dig graves years ago when they did. Maybe Randy still does but every once in a great while the hole would collapse before the internment. Did you ever have to go back because of that?
That forklift driver did you dirty. Bad Driver! Bad
That background music sucks, have to skip over it
Asd long as the guy ,running the bottom edge, of any roofing system knows how to bend them bent sheets falling if the trailer sheets to match perfect with the rest and not leak
Well you'll have good YouTube content when a good wind takes the shop down. Why did the lyrics, "if it weren't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all!" pop in my head while watching this video?
New sprayers
It is amazing to see the progress on your farm and how you stay on task.  Good job and puppy looks healthy and well cared for!
No dumb guy comments! It is just not in your area of expertise!
Have you considered some sort of utility dump cart that is big enough to hold all the dirt you take out for a grave, then you make one trip across with all the dirt, dump it and done, instead of running back and forth multiple times with just a bucket load of dirt? Just a thought.
Have you ever hit a coffin when digging?
Girls on the wall and pulling in the roof
I would want new panels  .look how much you are paying for them. At least  a discount
Happy to have more videos 👍🏼
You have me confused, how often should I look for your posts?
Cole, I hope you read the comments, we take the time to write, at least let us know.
Cole must be a dad now he’s usually more consistent! Did the baby come yet?
"LIKE" button has been torqued to the manufacturer's recommended specification. "CLICK".   God forbid you should be running around Iowa there on the farm with a loose "LIKE" button !
How is your house remodel coming along? I am interested in seeing what you've done so far.
Well come one can't operate a Moffitt......
:)
It seems like you have a mind for learning - keep up the good work 💯
Hey y'all cornstar
Will be nice to fix up the shop.
Really got your priorities right don't you I think I'd be finishing my house before I did the shop
This should make for some good content and will look really nice when it's finished !
I hope you did a certain room in the house before you started playing in the shed.....
Man that jbc is growing on me.... The more I see it the more I like it!
Y’all need  dump truck .
Cole…..i think they call those batten…..that run across the walls 😊😊😊
Why don't we see Nava anymore on the channel??
gas is just screw pipe , pipe dope and tighten, then leak check.
You all work so hard and it makes me wonder why are you all having so much fun if it's called work ....  I already know why but what would you all do if you all really had a fun day 🤣
Glad to see so much progress in the shop renovation. I imagine the space to become one of efficiency; you'll not remember how it was a few years down the road!!!  Blessings!
How’s the house renovation going.  Haven’t seen anything on that for a long time.   Good to see you back!
hope you have better luck then i did when i bought a bundle of 2x4 they put a bunch of bad boards ( bark  on one side bent boards and some that were twisted) good luck on your project
You need to fix the railings on the bin site before you build the shop, I would hate to watch the video on Daddy Cornstars' grave being dug.
New skins for inside the shop nice 👍🏾.
The boards add strength to your building
knowing how cole does things, it will be a mess and we will have plenty of click bait videos to whine about stuff.
There used to be a post office box number here because I sent fan mail before but now it’s gone what is the address for mail? Thanks
see you got the snow and Ice now
Hope the shop comes out great
It looks much warmer to be working inside instead of outside. It looks like you are right about the storm coming.  Have you figured out what to do with all the snow you will be getting ? Build a snowman, have a snowball fight, do some cross-country skiing across the fields ?
Good to see you again nice video
Wow. Just wow. I don't really think you understand how dangerous you were being loading that metal roof. The two of you are lucky to not have broken legs or big gashes in your legs I've seen it happen before. A stack of metal roofing will cut your leg off just like one piece will let you open to the bone.
Nave? What’s she up to?  I enjoy her influence
Cole I just got my third pair of pit vipers after my second pair that I got for christmas was stolen
Howdy Cole the Cornstar how you doing
Around here deaths comes in three’s for some reason????
😎🤙🦅
You cut that diagonal board off the wall. In short that's a bad idea. Thats the bracing for the wall and it doesn't appear you have replaced it with something equivalent. There is a metal diagonal brace you can get now that will sit on the wall, you need them.
I’m pretty used to seeing commercials that are agricultural in nature. Didn’t expect to see a diaper commercial before the video started.😂😂
I find that I enjoy grave digging.
The new little puppy is a hoot.       Good seeing you all again.   Nows a good time to reduce the clutter in the shop.
Good adjustment for the intro.
Is Ellie Cooper's dog? Or is she MC and DC"s dog?
Pretty fancy machine.
Hi Cole glad to see you all back at it, and how's it going with the Bin site problems it's been a while
I LOVE the progress on the shop!!! 🔥🔥🔥👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Id walk myself right back in and say.. Discount those panels your loader just damaged.
Who pays the bills if your equipment breaks under digging a grave?
Im confused is this a new puppy ?
Must be the go funds are paying off
15th love your videos Cole everyone he deserves a like
Bin update ?
👍👍👍👍👍
cant wait to watch lets see if its good always love the vids
Wow, I guess youtube had decided not to show me any of your videos for the last couple of months. I thought y'all had taken a huge break from posting. Good to see you're alive and kicking.
Happy New Year!!! ❤
Hi
