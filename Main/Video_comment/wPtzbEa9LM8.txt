Natalie you are stunning!
Happy birthday Drew 🎉🎂🎉🎉🎂🎉❤❤❤
Lisa looks just as beautiful. I adore her
Where’s Kim
Omg fuvk this is crazy they are still together l the show was 45 years ago. this so classic and they are still so beautiful 😍 how did I  miss this. They the coolest girls on tv the old days. Not drew all girls for generations and generations who watched this awesome girl show . For the past 45 years every generations of girls who use to watch this show . They inspire us to be a real woman and independent even more then that . This show has helped a lot of different girls from different places around the world.
Like, WTF🥴 .... them girls look like grandma s now. Life is cruel, fk!
Tbis is really amazing and beautiful.
Tootie said I hate drew y am I going? 😂😂😂
That show was so under the radar and a joke to people who were growing up in the 1980s. Most of us were rebels who were growing up much faster than the little squeaky clean nerds on that show. People today think this show was all that. It was not! We were busy with our lives and growing up. We didn’t have time to sit around watching this stupid show on TV that portrayed teenagers as absolute dorks.
And you know what's funny the only two that don't get along is Nancy McKeon and Kim Fields because you never see those two in the same room ever since one of them made a career choice
Omg I would be in Heaven!
You're A Man talk like one
Where is tootie😢?
True Lisa whelchel still looking good they all look well actually only one missing is Kim fields.
How is Drew connected with them.
I don’t know why this seemed fake to me…..
I miss this I use to love watching that show this is a good video I love it wow
Well dang where is Tudy? And i had such a crush on Jo
Where’s tootie?…😮😂😂😂❤❤
Where's Kim Fields "Tootie"?😢
Where's Kim Fields?
When I watch the facts of life it takes me back to when I was a kid in Corpus Christi,Texas.
Where’s Kim
I wonder if Joe has an issue with Tootie? Tootie is missing.,
Can't stand Drew.  She seems so fake.  Is she still double clutching the coffee mugs and legs crossed on the couch?  Why do women do that?    Lisa and Nancy looks great.  Not sure what species Mindy is.
Lisa Whelchel is still gorgeous and has barely changed! And that enviable hair is perfection as it always was!
Amen 💯👏🏼
Miguel Poveda, De Dannan and the Hothouse Flowers... And a rave...
I watched that show all the time. I had a crush on Lisa from the time i saw her on The Mickey Mouse Club
What did I just watch.  I live on a different planet than Drew Barrymore.  That was some weird stuff.
Where is Kim Fields!
OMG Drew Barrymore is so cringe!! and fake as F gee!!
Wow I have never seen Drew's show before and she is so irritating.
❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️
Joe is still so freaking cool.
Legendary
Wow Blair is still gorgeous ❤
I Love You Drew!❤
Who TF is that person announcing everything with Drew?!
How can they never get all four of these girls together at the same time?
❤
I loved this show growing up.  This was my era
HEY SATNELY SHARVIS CALL TORRORRW STOP 🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩😘🤩🤩
The year their graduation show aired was the same year I graduated
I was 11 years old and knew what I was about to be exposed to in my young years,lying,manipulative,sociopath crossed my path,tried to get others to hate me but it didn't work,sure I wanted to get away from a person who was a sociopath and still is today
Work kept me busy in my teen years and on weekends staying away from the problems that are people that popped up,separated myself from the situation,no drama no stress,not having to look at people I didn't like as much as I possibly could stay away but still get to see my mother
I watch all of Nancy's movies
Im the one person who didn't mind being shipped away if I could be away from certain annoying people around me,not my parents other people my age
In reference to being a child in an environment they didn't want to be at not living at home,not my parents fault,dealing with unwanted situations and running away to a private school any school sure most young youth don't want to deal with the people around them so yeah I said I would love to go to a school away from my environment to get away from my then changing situation
I got the pleasure to meet she such a sweet and beautiful woman such a sweet spirit!!!
Still al lovely ladies
Where's Kim
No Kim Fields????
All of them still  look great
Drew and the GAY boy host both NEED to get serious NARCISSISTIC counseling and FIND God, because they're both beyond delusional and living in FANTASY LAND!! What clowns 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Wheres tootie aka kim fields ? Why did she not come ???
Blair looks like she hasn’t aged wow
Where’s Tootie
Where is Tottie
I wish Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon,  Mindy Cohn, and Drew Barrymore would surprise me on my next birthday, next February 23 2026! @DrewBarrymore
It’s still hard not to crush on Lisa whelchel
They've aged rather well.
the E.T. broad drew looks like she's 95 years old stuck in a 45 year old body lmao
this shht is SO STAGED lmao shaddapppp......this is trash T.V. 'as the norm', now in americantowitznsteinNberg SMH.  no wonder most boycott this 💩
why the fcuk do they have to be on THIS queerdo weirdo show for SMH. oh wait, it's a little hat tribe funding, duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Someone’s missing
What kind of a fruity ass show is this?
Where's Tootie?
Psychotic Drew and her levels
Damn shame Kim Fields did not appear.
Not the same without Tootie.
No tootie
I'm 51 grew up watching this show classic TV shows best
Wow, I'm a guy but I think Drew perfectly described the attraction that show had to all of us "latch key" kids during that time.  That was amazing,
Absolutely  terrific  surprise 😊
Where is Trudy? That’s not a reunion with out Trudy
Sr. Commander Commando Legionnaire Kevin Christopher Seamon of the United States Military in Saginaw Michigan
Where's Tootie???
They still look so amazing. Love the facts of life because of these ladies? Missed seeing Kim Fields though😞
What really would have been impressive would have been if she busted out the season 1 lyrics: there’s a place you gotta go for learnin’ all you oughtta know about the facts of life…the facts of life…when the boys you used to hate you start to date it’s time to investigate the facts of life..
As corny as it is, it’s wonderful and Drew was totally genuine. No acting or fawning, just her true self at the moment. Nice to see.
Lisa looks exactly the same 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh Ramgers Brother. Is She Realated To Laverne? Or Scott I Am not A Cowboy now.
Thats Her.  Lmao.
Y'all dead wrong u didn't include the original cast where is KIM FIELDS
Mindy looks like a cat lady and hoarder
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
I heard that they didn't even ask Kim Fields to appear for the reunion. 😭
Drew is the sweetest person on the planet.❤
Where was Tudi?
They look amazing
As for me any way this is the grls I grew up w/ in grew to live in boys as good friends in theses kind of  D H. Situations I was lived inn😊
The facts of life is just that from foster moms to group homes to detention to the other side of the world in back
Using God's name in vain If you are Saying omg gd (long or short version), oh my gosh, geez, jeez, jeezus, jesus or Jesus Christ, gawd, lawrd, or any Variations when Not talking to Abba Father God  😠🤭🤫🛐🙏🏼 Exodus 20:7 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Leviticus 19:12 12 "And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD." Leviticus 24:11-23 11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them. 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death. 17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.  18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.  19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;  20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.  21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.  22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.  23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses. Deuteronomy 5:11 11 “Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.”  Psalms 139:20-22 20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.  21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. Matthew 15:17-20 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. James 5:12 12 “But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.”  Colossians 3:17 17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
This was kind of cool and i dont want to be negative BUT WHERE IS TOOTIE!!!!! Ok, ok I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt that Kim Fields had a scheduling conflict
I ❤ Joe.  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love ❤them so much
These ladies look GREAT!! ❤ How awesome to see these three! I wanted the camera to rest on them a little more, even though I realized it's Drew's birthday 🎂
I just opened a can of Fancy Feast for my cat and the juice got on my fingers 🤮 and I'm watching this with stinky fingers 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
This proves that it is Kim Fields they are not cool with.
Without Kim Fields, it's not complete. But I love these ladies too.
Where is Kim feels?You can't do a fact of life reunion without her or mentioning her!
Missing Tootie!
What are we doing g? Where’s Kim Fields?
LOVE
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Happy birthday Drew! Thank you for bringing awareness for brain injury survivors! ❤️🔆
Where is Kim fields
it would be so annoying to be drews friend she is so fake 😂
TOGGAF
Missing one I think is Trudy
Soooo no Kim?!!!!
Why is Tootie is not on there?
Her dress.
I always related to Joe’s wicked sense of humor 😂 ❤🙌
Live that cast of women!Happy Birthday Drew!
Damn I remember watching that show , I really didn't care for the show to much but I had a Big Crush on Nancy who played Jo when I younger she was the exact kinda girl I wanted wasn't a afraid of anything or getting her hands dirty .  She's still looking hot and I think my crush just came back 😍😘
Not a reunion without Tootie. And didn't even mention her
I grew up with grandparents, an uncle and a sister, not conventional
Wow!!!  What a great reunion! The only flaw was Charlotte Rae and Kim Fields absence. :(
Love the beautiful dog.  Good to see the cast, just missing Kim Fields.
wonder why Nancy doesnt act anymore....she's a great actress!!!
Wheres Tootie
Who is the high pitched woman dressed in a man’s suit? As if Drew’s show wasn’t desperate and drab enough already….
And where was Kim Fields "Tootie" are they serious
Kim Fiields looks great.   Good for her to not think she's above it all and recognize WHAT made her famous in the first place.
Where's tootie
Tootie?
What happened to Kim Field.?
I’m surprised that Lisa Wilcher was there. The other two aren’t talking to her anymore because she was the reason the reunion show didn’t happen.
I cannot with Drew…
What the heck is Drew wearing!!! That is a fashion NO!!!
They look fantastic!!!
Love this shows
Loved facts of life !!! Loved when tootie was on roller skates !!!! There’s going to be troooooooubbbbleeee!😁🛼😍
That was so much fun. What can't we EVER get ALL FOUR of them in the same damn room at the same time, ever? It's always just 3 of them!!!.... lol
Where is Kim?
Lisa was one of my childhood crushes.
Mindy loss a whole lot of weight.
Good Lord, someone needs an intervention! 🙄🙄🙄
Mindy Cohn looks weird as HELL!!!
It was so nice to see Nancy Mckeon with some of the old gang I clicked the second I seen her in the thumbnail I liked all of them but Nancy Mckeon is my favorite I relate to her more I got so happy when I seen Nancy had Instagram and I followed her so quick  and I’ve seen almost everything Nancy Mckeon was ever in I was born 1985 so I got to see  The Facts Of Life on Nick & Nite . Even when I saw you had Instagram and other socials Drew I followed you to I loved you in E.T. That’s how I got introduced to you and been a fan ever since. this was a great reunion I miss seeing Kim Fields there but it was nice to see Lisa Whelchel, Nancy Mckeon and Mindy Cohn all together and it was so sweet of them to bring you that dope The Facts Of Life bag full of goodies
Is that a man or a woman I'm just totally confused here
OMG how amazing!!!!!
I guess we know who the greedy B was....
one of the rare sitcoms where none of the child stars turned into drug addicts.
that guy is SOOOO weired!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah that didn't last long
Where's tootie??
Now that's a bday gift
Rewatching after finding out Lisa backstabbed them all. 😂
Where's Tootie?  🛼
Wonder if Blair ask to go out in front of the other😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Growing up in the 80s with my facts of life tv family was an experience I would never ever trade!
DB is the most fake, insincere and annoying persons I have ever seen. Pathetic.
Where is Kim Fields?
Amazing memories of watching every season of The Facts of Life when I was a kid. We’ll sadly never see another show like it again…🙏
They barely aged they look great i see Kim Fields doesn't wanna be the token black girl good for her!
You know what? That show caught me at the exact wrong time for me. I was just too cool!  TOO cool. Just thought they were geeks or whatever. What an IDIOT I was.🤦‍♀️ Looking at it now, I wish I had been everything these girls were. I had the opportunity. I was the most like Jo, personality, my parents weren’t the other girls parents, rich, but we were doing all right. Could have done anything I wanted (college, not travel the world) I wish I could have respected myself as much as she did, they ALL did, instead of thinking I was a know it all cool chick. Could have saved me a lot of grief in my life.
Not the same without Kim ❤
I absolutely love you guys. Till this day I rember most of the shows. Thanks you the fact's of life
Where's Tootie?
I so loved this so so much. I'm 55 and they basically raised us latch key kids! us girls all wanted friendships like this. RIP Charlotte Rae :( you were my TV mama. Missed Ms. Tootie all of they looked amazing!
Brady Bunch, Facts of Life, Different Strokes, Silver spoons, many of these show grounded the latchkey kids of the 80s. Feels like home to see these faces.
I had such a crush on Jo. Watched every single episode
Where is Kim fields?
Yep tv shows have never been the same as the 80's  born in April 1974 I grew up on these shows 😊
Nancy McKeon will ALWAYS be my favorite. I had the pleasure of meeting her when she appeared in the recent NYC play, Pen Pals. She is a joy!
Soo...amazing to see them here. This remains one of my ALL TIME fav shows. Seeing Nancy ( who rarely appears on anywhere), is soo...special 🫶 o.s Drew is ALWAYS soo..gracious 🤟
Drew is always so grateful!!!
No Tootie
You don’t see Nancy that often…special treat.
For those speculating about Tootie, you can see they didn't show all of the reunion.  They might have mentioned Kim Fields, but we don't know.  For those who think Kim was in prison- shame on you.  She's actually a director and was probably too busy to come.
Kim Fields should have been on the show
Why does that man in the pink jacket have a woman's voice lol?!!
Per Mindy, there was talk of a reboot however it fell apart because one of girls insisted that the show be all about her and only her.   The body language here is undeniable as to who it was.
It was so moving they got together for Drew & it was so nice to see her deservedly moved, thank you ladies.
Drew is odd but love this for her 😂
Nancy McKeon showed up.  What a shocker.
Great show and great bd surprise🎉
Natalie was the best friend I would have loved to have
So Tootie was the wrong color, apparently.
❤❤😢
Saved By The Bell always made reference on the facts of life . Slater & Tori Scott quote Jo, Zack Morris loved Blair, Lisa Turtle & Screech Powers Tootie’s Braches , and Kelly & Jessie, Natalie .
Where's the black girl?
Nancy Cohn going on shows bashing one of her co stars 👌 looks like the only one here isn’t Kim Fields.
Wow YouTube 😡 🤬
Not a reunion without Tootie (Kym Fields)
I loved this show!
Champagne?  Napkins?
All four girls have aged beautifully, especially Lisa, who is now a grandma in her 60s.
They need to get rid of Ross. It's because he's gay, it's just he adds nothing to Drew's show
The fats of life
Drew has a forever young heart 💕..you just cant hate on her.
If there’s not a reunion show or reboot, it’s because of Kim. After watching this clip, that seems clear.
I think the two hosts just did two lines of rainbow, unicorn, fart, coke..
Drew is an elite puppet, ick..
I always wanted to be the slice of roast beef in a Blair-Tootie-Natalie sandwich.
Just think Lisa appeared on Survivor and did a Tyler Perry movie.
Where's Kim Fields?
BEAUTIFUL.  WOMAN. I LUV U.  N I WOULD. ALWAYS.  ALWAYS.  PHONE HOME.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY. ANGEL.   25❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
LOVE THE FACTS OF LIFE❤❤❤
wheres tootie
Maaaaan my childhood all 4 of these women still look amazing❤❤❤
Where is Kim Fields
Nancy “Jo” was my favorite, I’m 54 now but I had “crush” on “Jo”
Where’s Kim Fields?
Happy birthday!🎉where's tootie?
I loved Natalie
I LOVE this !!!
i love that the voice of velma kinda looks like velma
They all look so gorgeous ❤
My favorite 80s TV show. I could watch it over and over.
Where is Kim Fields?
Love the facts of life forever!!
3:15  It was nice to hear Drew mention Jaid.  It has been so long.
Her reaction to the music did it for me 😂😭❤️
Loved seeing The Facts of Life cast! LOVED seeing awesome Lisa Whelchel!🥰
The three of them should do a show together more in the lines of Golden Girls or even a mix between the heart warming Golden Girls mixed with some of the Last of the Summer Wine antics, both of which focus on how life can still be full of fun and adventure everyday even after retirement. You're not dead until you're dead!
Where's Kim Fields? No mention of her.
I saw Mindy Cohn shopping one day in 1988 and I was starstruck! Her and Tootie made me laugh
Drew Barrymore is the most dramatic person on earth.
Was it Kim Fields who sabotaged the Facts of Life reboot?  Mindy Cohn said that someone did, and that she and the others weren't really talking to them anymore.  And one if them isnt there, so...
I’m getting the feeling that Kim fiends is the odd one out as I’ve heard they were planning a reboot show but one of the girls decided to go rogue behind everyone’s back and try to advocate for their own show instead and ruined the comeback show. So not shocked tutti isn’t here
Class is back in session
The  of life was  one my favorite shows I grew up with  I still watch the reruns I love it
Mindy needs a makeover stat.
Awesome, well done ladies!
Mindy Cohn sure looks different...and not for the better either
They did not even mention Tootie. Kim Fields is the most successful main character from that show.
Amen so true drew love your words happy bless brith day
Too bad Tootie didn't show up
Tommy passed away which is Nancy's brother he played on Alice.
I was in a single parent home, and my mom worked a lot, so we pretty much raised ourselves as well.
Gosh it’s amazing how fantastic Lisa Welchel looks. ❤
Eastland was my dream growing up, I would have done anything to be a part of the Facts of Life family.
Where is TooTie
Drew Barrymore is so overly dramatic…… and weird
Nancy, check.  Mindy, check. Lisa, check.  Kim... Kim.... hmmm.
Where's Tootie?
I lost respect for Drew Barrymore when she drawled all over whatshisname from the days of girlhood, who's a phony transperson and real grifter
Nancy McKeon sounds like a smoker and they all look broke.. I didn't like Lisa Welchel then and I still don't like her now..
Was this before or after the drama??? They hid it pretty well. I would watch anything that Nancy or Mindy was on - great actors.
Anybody here to watch and study the body language of the cast after Mindy’s “greedy b***h” bombshell this week??? Just me? Cool, cool.
I love Nancy I wish she acted more but she's always been reclusive and especially since her brother died.
Considering the fact that Mindy spilled the tea this week and they all pretty much hate Lisa this was a pretty big deal.
Still wondering who it was that squashed the Facts of Life revival series.
Who is the twit with the bowtie?
Does the producer of the show actually keep the identity of the guests from Drew? Is her surprise real or scripted?
Okay, that was like, too adorable for words.
Is Tootie the greedy person Mindy was talking about on that Podcast?
Kim Fields is a greedy bit she ruined the reunion
So. Where is Tootie aka Kim Fields?
Where's Kim??????????
Yes, where is Kim Fields (Tootie)?
They all look awesome!❤
I don't think The Facts of Life could've afforded to have Drew be on the show after E.T.
I say this without a trace of disrespect. But Drew just FEELS like a very disconnected person. Every single episode its some "surprise" that makes her tear up to the point she's out of words. It's just very old already. Why not just be a normal person and hang out with celebrities and tell stories and laugh and have fun? Why does everything have to be an "honor of my life" moment? When is she just ever going to have a show where we just laugh and thats it.
The FATS of life
They didn't say more then 3 words. :(
Strong independent WOMAN, Drew.
They're all hugging and kissing on stage, like they didn't already meet and talk to one another backstage in the green room beforehand.  Fake TV !!
I literally watch facts of life everyday hahaha... I just love that show❤
The Drew show is a joke. Mindy Cohn is disgusting.
I loved the facts of Life... Watched it every time it was on growing up! It was sweet that these ladies came out to the shower Drew's birthday. ❤🎉
Um... where is Kim Fields at?
Who’s the mo in the pink jacket?
Where is tootie?
My all-time favorite show, "The Facts of Life,"  I love to watch reruns on YouTube. I was 17 when the show first came out. Awwhhh the wonderful memories. Life was simpler back then.  I miss who America used to be. 😢
It's hard to believe it's been forty plus years since The Facts of Life was first on the air. They all look great, and it was great that Nancy McKeon was there.
So cringe
Drew's a has been. This is a horrible show
Where's Kim Fields?
So where is Kim Fields, oh I guess " This is not a show for her"!!! Maybe if it was Tamara Hall...
I liked them all but the s k ates on tootie were not necessary
What happened to va va voom kim fields
THAT'S DIFFERENT A Dog on the show but good it's there this time they got there space.
Drew comes across as not intelligent.
Where is Tootie.
Kim Fields probably had a good reason for not being there. I remember a morning show where she reunited with Lisa, and Kim was ecstatic to the point of not being able to speak. I think they get along well. I haven't heard of any animosity between them.
They look great.
Where’s Tootie?
No Tootie?
Man I'm old.. sigh.
I didn't have Drew's experience growing up, but i enjoyed the show. It never dawned on me how this show would have touched others, and I'm glad Drew shined a light on that.
I like Drew. I heard she is one of the nicest, friendliest celebrities you'll ever meet in real life. But her show is so bleh.
They all look fabulous! I like Mindy Kohn's look and hairstyle!
where is tootie
Couldn't they afford Kim Fields? Maybe Tootie's tooties have grown too big for the dinky limo they sent to her mansion.
I love that Drew is so appreciative of them.
What the heck is Mindy wearing, did she borrow some clothes from the homeless❓
Love Drew Barrymore, but it's kind of odd to see her take the place of Tootie in that pic with the girls.  I know Kim Fields is usually busy with her kids and all, but would love to see her show up more for those little reunions.
Drew is so cringe. What an embarrassment.
I loved the facts of live 💕also Drew where did you get that dress I really want to get one 🎈💕
Drew is right. Young girls with solitary'ish lives found comfort with these girls ❤❤❤ thank you!!!
Now I'm really sad that Drew didn't get to guest star on one of the later seasons 😭 She could have been part of the new Eastland when Blair became headmistress in the series finale
❤
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
RIP Charlotte aRae. ❤ What a sweet segment. Forever show and iconic characters.
I'm STILL crushing on Nancy McKeon!!  Still a beautiful woman!!
I wish Trudy was there. Really wish Ms G could be there too. Loved the show.
Where's TOOTI???? 🤔
US children of the 80s, we really had it good.
Blair and Jo look the same
Where's Tootie? Actress Kim Fields
Wonderful seeing them all except Tootie.
I keep waiting for Kim to come out in rollerskates....haha
Where’s Tootie
Nancy McKeon is such a Beautiful lady.
They look great
is that a guy on the left?   lol
Where is "Tootie?"😊
This made me cry.
Where’s Tootie (Kim)?
Where is Tootsie. Kim fields.
That was So Awesome.❤
So a star is starstruck? Would they come to my house if I asked? My birthdays in August. It was my favorite show too. They look wonderful.
those ladies in that show were my family growing up...forever grateful for this entire series...Missing Ms. G
Nancy and Lisa look exactly the same 45 years later and Mindy looks BETTER 😮 🤔 I'm starting a diet tomorrow 😵‍💫
Why isn't tootie there
I thought Kim should be there with Lisa, Mandy and Nancy.
Lisa Whelchel was at the Morrison's Cafeteria Restaurant in Annapolis, MD one of my shifts, and eating her dinner with a couple there.  She must have kin in Anne Arundel County because they assured her.  She would have some privacy.  What really gave it away was she was eating with them in the Banquet area which was closed off and not in use.  She denied who she was, and maybe I should've left her alone, but how often do you meet someone from a television show?  Naturally, I was more into Nancy Mckeon, but Blair was nice to meet.
It's amazing how Drew Barrymore is an actress herself, but she's so star stuck by the cast of the facts of life 😊
🎶🎊❤️🐻🌹👋🏽
This show briught me immense joy and confort - still does!
Def loved that show.... 🥰🥰
Drew is so goofy
I haven't watched drew anymore since she changed to a half hour show. I don't know when it comes on in Tennessee now.
I hate the 3
😎❤️🔥🌹🙏🏾🎈
Nancy McKeon was always my favorite. I’m so happy to see her!! Where is Kim Fields? She was on late night last week❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎈
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
👋🏽😎😃🌹🎈🐻🍩🥳
Drew needs to take more acting lessons. She couldnt ever fake being surprised
The gayest show in the world..
awesome
We miss you Kim Fields❤
They look great! ❤ Where the hell is Tootie? ❤
I was on the set of the reunion TV movie years ago  in Toronto as an extra. Since I was a fan as kid, it was so great to add my little stamp to the show 😆😆
Where's Tootie!?
Wanted to hear more from the cast, not Drew.
❤I loved the Facts Of Life. I am 60 and I still watch the reruns Logo tv.  Ladies you look great❤
whose granny on the end?
I love u drew
Lisa is hot❤
Blair was my crush, but Jo was HOT!!
Seriously, when did Drew Barrymore become Mrs. Roper?
That’s so cool wow
Also R. I. P. Cloris "Beverly Anne" Leachman
Would be nice to see a Facts of Life reboot.
Where's Tootie?  She too good for this sort of stuff?    ty
Why isn't Kim ( Tootie) there?!!!!
Too dramatic.  Sorry.
This is awesome! The Facts of Life was one of my absolute FAVORITE shows growing up, mainly cos I was 12 when it debuted so I identified. I can't believe how little they've changed! Mindy probably looks the most different.
Fake surprised Drew…like she didn’t know who would be on her show.
Drew, I  feel the same. I didn't have a conventional family so The facts of life was so helpful to me as a child.
Whats up with the weird guy needs mental help like the rest of them
I love how they included Mrs. G in it
For everyone wondering where Tootie is, my understanding is that she had a prior engagement with Kim Cattrall that she refused to cancel. (Must be a "Kim" thing.)
where was tootie
If Kim Fields was there, I'll bet Drew probably would've asked her if she can still skate today.  In season 1, she wore roller skates everywhere because she was shorter than everyone else so they had her wear skates to make her look taller.
Where was Kim Fields???
They look so great!!!!
Where’s Kim fields?
Where's tootie??? 🤷
Those three ladies look as good or better than they did 45 years ago.  This made me smile as much is it did Drew.
Always had a thing for Blair. Where’s Tootie?? Miss Fields too big to make an appearance for Drew?? lol
Loved this. But Natalie looks older than blaire and jo.  Lol. I think it's her outfit.  Wonder why tootie wasn't there.  Rip Charlotte Rae and Gloris Leachman.
My favorite show is a kid I always had such a crush on Blair  🙂 it was a fun show but it had a lot of good lessons in it too
Wheres kim field's
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊love you
Where's Tootie!?!?
I wish Kim Fields was there. 😢
We need more 70s and 80s sitcom reruns shown on TV to show our children and grandchildren how much fun we had when we were their age.  They were full of laughs, some teary moments, spoke to us personally, and appropriate for almost all ages.
Where's Kim Fields?
Tootsy is always missing.
Where's Tootie?
Burn in hell Drew Barrymore
Something’s happened to Drew.  I can see it.  She’s definitely excited, but she went through something life changing recently.  I hope she’s ok and that Hollyweird didn’t crush her like all the other good souls that stick it out.
I always liked Nancy McKeon..I'd still make her legs spaghetti
They all look great, aging well.  Nancy McKeon was an early crush as a kid...she's still got it.
Love the facts of life so great to see them together again ❤❤❤❤
Trump 2024 🇺🇸
Wendy and Nancy hasn’t aged at all
WHERE WAS TOOTIE, KIM FIELDS
What happened to Tootie?
Your missing Kim Fields???
There is. No testosterone to be found on this show, Jeez. They /them is literally floating on air.
I loved the Facts of Life. I'm 55 now and I still watch the show on YouTube. All 3 of these ladies have such a great look. in different yet equally admirable ways. I love all of them!!!
Where was kim fields
What is wrong with drew Barrymore?
So the person in a suit is a woman pretending to be a man. This show is so fake.
R.I.P Ms Garratt Were Is Tootie
Good Morning Happy Birthday Drew❤
I'm just here to see Nancy McKeon, haven't heard anything about her in years! She was one of my big crushes 🥰
Ross is gay.  Yuck
Mindy was my favorite! The whole Shawn Cassidy pillowcase, turned into a diaper was classic!!! ❤❤❤
Drew Barrymore makes me want to throw up literally 😂
Mindy Cohn Hi I’m Mindy I’ve always dreamed of looking 75 at 55 lol 😘😘
👋🏽🎊😍🎈🌹☀️💚🙏🏾🌞😋
Happy birthday drew 🎉 that is my favorite show. I miss the 1980s
I loved the facts of life .  I have the Box sets as well as some memorabilia as well. I like many of the those other shows from the 80’s as well.
They all look fantastic 🥰
This is so awesome
Where was Kim Fields??
Wow, they have all aged incredibly well 45 years later.
🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞👋🏽
The black girl is missing. Surprise, surprise.
LOVE THIS!!!!!
I still love all of y'all, and y'all look wonderful❤
Don't forget about Cloris Leachman who played Mrs. Garrett's younger sister Beverly Ann
How she feels about facts of life is how I feel about Star Trek TNG and Voyager. For almost the same reasons. *not jon, his partner, we share an account.*
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😊🌞🌞🌞
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE the Facts of Life.  I love the whole cast.   Where’s Tootie💛?
Where’s Tooty?
Awesome ❤❤😊
Why didn't Tootie make the effort, that would have been even more amazing! But this was a great gift for her! Beautiful!
They all still look the same!
This is wild! Back in the mid 80s, you would see a commercial for The Facts of Life show one minute and, then, a commercial for a movie staring Drew Barrymore, the next!
Drew makes me sick, she is so annoying.
Drew giving Taylor Swift a run for her money on faking a surprise reaction.
I met Kim fields in Oklahoma city at a seminar about drugs in the 1980s, she was very good speaker
This is  so AWESOME!!!!  I feel like I've gone back in a time machine at my Parent's home ... good times
Where’s Tootie!?
She looks exactly like herself, just older, but great. Not obvious plastic surgery.
Mindy we love you!!!
Television 📺 was much better during the 80s and before with a few exceptions like Will & Grace. Hysterical!
what about Tutti???
I would be be dead, that was and still is my all-time favorite
They started playing the music. I started singing along. I didn't finish until 1:15😁😁😁
Eric Clapton and his Wife and Daughters would make for a great DREW show . ✨🎸✨🇺🇸🏆🏅
Kim Fields looks at a minimum of 10 yrs younger than her cast mates.
Where's  Tootie??
Im an 80s kid and this show was everything to me.
Why does Mindy look like she's cosplaying the grandma from Little Red Riding Hood? She's only like 55ish.
Where was Kim Fields? Love these women!
Usually, it's Nancy, who skips the reunions, but, where was miss Kim?
OMG they all look the same, even better than they did 40+ years ago.  This show was my childhood as well.  What an amazing surprise!! xo
What a birthday gift this had to be!  As a man who didn't grow up in a 2-parent household (my parents were kids when I was born), I can relate to what Drew's talking about at the 3:07 mark.
Beautiful!!! Happy Birthday Drew🎉🎉🎉 Facts of life was one of my favorites as a child as well❤
Drew talks more than her guests
The Division Nancy rocked it on that show !!!
What a delightful surprise. A treasured cast of actors. A part of Americana - all the good things we remember about the old days. Tugs at my heart to see them together.
I still watch the facts of life.  They all look amazing.  Blair hair is the same 😍
Lisa  Nancy  Mindy kim The Facts of Life  Love my favorite one fan BIG 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖⭐️⭐️💖💖🎶 God bless you  Drew 💖 love my favorite one fan BIG 💖
I wonder where Kim Fields was? I wanted to see tootie!
Where’s tootie …😊
🤢🤮
I wish I didn't know these things have been practiced and everyone knows, not really a surprise. Kind of ruins it for me
That was so sweet!!
Off the start. The reason why this world is going to destroy itself. Man and woman in one from the beginning of this "show". Drew sold herself to the devil for more money just like the rest.
When all else fails, get your own talk show.
I remember watching the show back in my childhood memories the best miss those days
This is the first time I  have seen Nancy McKeon since her brother passed away.
Loved them soooo much!!!💝
Where was Kim fields
Happy Birthday Drew.
It was great to see Blair and Jo....still Beautiful as always as well as Drew is.   I'm sorry Tooti and Natalie couldnt make it, but it was nice that Natalie's Grandmother was able to fill in for her!❤
💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
It’s not a reunion without Kim fields
If you haven't seen The Tracy Thurman movie with Nancy McKeon,  do so . Its a really goid 80s movie.
Nancy Mckeon was my favorite,  loved the Jo character.
🫶🏽
Im sorry, but this was a terrible show. Not the least bit funny.
Aw I love the  Facts of Life! All three look great.
Facts of Life first aired in 1979. Drew was 4. I was born in 1968 so I remember when this show aired. I absolutely loved it and watched it every week. I am a gay male so it may have been strange for other boys my age to watch this but as a young gay adolescent who was clearly not out back then, it was such a pleasure to watch these ladies and Mrs. Garrett. This was definitely a Gen X show. Too bad Kim Fields couldn't have at least video in from wherever she was.
Happy Belated Birthday Drew Barrymore this is so cool having the facts of life cast members there I watched that show all the time always wished I could be on it love all the cast members and the lessons learned from watching ❤😊!!!
Why didn’t they mention Tootie/Kim Fields? Was there a feud of somekind somewhere along the ways?
loved this show too!
Loved this show
Wow....still hot after 40 years...
Hi Sabrina I'm larry valdez jr I'm your friend
DREW IS SUCH A SWEET SOUL !!
They still look great! :)
Happy Birthday Drew 💞💞🎁🎉🎈😻😻💍💪🍰🎂
Just A Tad Over Dramatic! Who Acts That Way On Their Birthday? Someone In Front Of A Camera Does!!!!!!!!!!!
They all look absolutely gorgeous
In these first few moment, Drew was all of us!
Ummmmmm Wheres my girl KIM FIELDS (TOOTIE)????????
Where is Kim Field???
The best! What a precious reunion!
She is such a fan girl at heart!
We have the same birthday, yea Drew and I do.
Where was Kim Fields
Tootie, I'm disappointed in you! :P
Does Lisa Whelchel ever age.
Could you imagine the facts of life gang and Drew Barrymore doing an updated version of "The Golden Girls"?  It would be the #1 comedy in the world.
WHAT HAPPENED TO TOOTIE !!!
❤ where's Tootie
Joe was my kid crush
The dude that’s hosting with Drew, I saw an episode of him on a tv show talking about how that’s his real voice and he “tried” to use a deeper voice. A voice analysis specialist for the fbi said this isn’t his real voice, and it’s super scary that this guy is pretending to talk this way, then went on about signs of a psychopath etc. He broke it down step by step. Insane lol
Is Drew gonna slower over them too. Ugh
Damn Lisa is beautiful!!!
No Dorothea? Didn’t that guy used to be much heavier?
Jo was my favorite. Cause i related to her tomboy character. I didnt like dresses and would beat  boy up lol. Natalie was also my fav cause she was funny. But all them together made a show I enjoyed watching. Cant believe how fast time flew by. 45 yrs thats crazy to me.
I love The Facts of Life !! I watch it everyday.  All the cast looks wonderful
This show is disgustingly woke.🤢🤮
Oh my god Drew is ridiculous…you would think they cured cancer…soooo phoney lol
Where is Tootie a.k.a  Kim Fields.  If George Clooney showed up, that would have really been a surprise
I admit it....I had a HUGE crush on Jo as a kid. Hope they're all well.
But, Where Kim fields.?.
Where was tootie🤔
Nancy is still the most beautiful!!!! And my first crush, still holds true!
Nancy is gorgeous! Always was my favorite!
Wow,  Mindy aged! I use to like how she would voice Velma in the Scooby Doo series
The guy at the beginning is a Fairy.
The hot girl with a bow tie is so out of touch with what's going on
Love Drew's gown!
the fat one in the grey sweater is a BEAST!!
SORRY BUT LETS,TELL THE TRUTH THEY LOOK AWFUL.  MINDY KOHN LOOKS LIKE AN OLD BAG LADY. TIME HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO THE FACTS OF LIFE GIRLS. DREW BARRYMORE  LOOKS HORRENDOUS TO CAN SOMEONE TEACH HER HOW TO DRESS. HOW IS HER SHOW WITH BOY GEORGE WANNA BE EVEN STILL IN PRODUCTION. THE AUDIENCE  HAS WHAT  20 PEOPLE IN IT. TV HAS GOT SO BAD.
Kim Fields??????
Who’s the lady on the left in pants? Was she on the show?
Aw, where's Tootie?
Wow, Nancy really nailed that New York accent to the wall on the show.  I had no idea she wasn't really from Brooklyn.
The entire cast has aged extraordinarily well.  These ladies need to reboot the series; I'm thinking something in the same vein of  _Sex in the City_ .
It's weird coz I just watched Facts of Life 😂 the ladies looks amazing 😅 I wish Tootie was with them
jesus kept lisa welchel young!
Ive been watching reruns of facts of life and cant get enough!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
What 1980’s kid-teenager didn’t love, and wish that they were friends with Blair, Jo, Natalie & Tootie! When I was in Australia, and I saw Sydney Opera House & Harbour Bridge, I cried because I always wanted to go to Australia like these girls, Andy (who didn’t have a crush on Mackenzie Astin 😘😍) and Mrs. Garrett did. Happy belated to my 1980’s child star queen, Miss Barrymore 👸🎥🎬🥳🎉🎂🎊🎈🎁
They all look great!
Happy birthday Drew love you in ET
It isn’t a facts of life reunion without Kim fields aka tootie
Omg what a dream! I grew up watching that show too and loved it :)
a worthless woke show featuring delusional has-beens who don't matter... go away
The fact this is recent and I’m just binging on the facts of life episodes
God, help us
Where is Tootie ?
WHERE THE HELL IS TOOTIE
I guess Tootie was too busy
That’s the good birthday gift 🎁
Where's Tootie?
Mindy has slowly become Diane Wiest
where is kim? i mean its not real without tootie lol
Nancy is still gorgeous af!
no tootie?she must not have gave sheeet!!sad!!
Is that guy "Ross"? the intern?
Can we give mindy a makeover she could look so young with different clothes and hair
this is what mental illness , life of delusion looks like.
Her reaction was soooooo phoney!!!
Season one was a not a great start.  Too many characters and moving parts.  The show almost got cancelled.  The changes producers made to save the show was epic.  Eliminating 1/2 the main cast, but adding Nancy McKeon was genius.  The show thrived at that point!
How stupid
Disgusting pole smoker
More like the fats of life.....amirite
I like that authentic bag .............
Where's Kim Fields (tootie) ?
Dont forget Kim
Drew, I LOVE your dress !
Nancy Mckeon is so fine🌹🌹🌹🌹
I am so excited as it was my favorite show back in the day too.
Drew Barrymore was a movie star during the 80s. It's so cute to see her so excited to meet her fav 80s tv stars.
All 80s icons !!!
Where's Tootie (Kim)?
Never watched the show but really fell in love with Lisa Welchel on Survivor and she really felt like a friend.  Still kind of upset she did not win.
I think it's hilarious to see grown men act like sissies.
No tooti!!
Can you bring this show back?❤
What a great reunion/birthday gift!  Ladies/Gentleman...you hit this one out of the ballpark. (Cue Beach Boys intro!)...Well done.
I think Drew over reacts to literally everything which unfortunately makes everything seem fake and less special/interesting.  She would be exhausting to be around if this is her real personality.
IS THAT A GUY??
So we’re just going to ignore the whole first season of Facts of Life?  Ok.
Loved this show and Joe was my favorite character! ❤
GET HIS GAY ASS OF THE SCREEN.
I been in the United States for 36 years it was fact the life, the show that teache me learn English... it was recommended by a English teacher who tell me about the show...
Where's Tootie, Kim Fields?
To hear Drew sing the song for the show IMMEDIATELY, wow. This was REAL. Wow.
I’ve seen a few Facts of Life reunions why don’t we ever see Kim Fields I’m those reunions?
This…just made my day. I love seeing how well they look! ❤
Lisa looks the same. Still a fox
Nancy is so beautiful. Lisa is so kind and Mindy just automatically puts a smile on my face❣️🥰 Happy Birthday Drew❣️
Drew is soooo over dramatic about everything. Over acting is her gift. 🙄
I met Kim Fields
JO!!!!!!!!
I had such a crush on Nancy McKeon. ♥️
Hummmmm where is tootie funny she wasn’t mentioned once.
Where was Molly?🤔. Drew has pretty dress❤
Nancy hasn't aged a bit
Drew, Should had E.T or Her E.T siblings come for her Birthday.
I loved this!
Nancy looks great. Don’t see much of her. She wants to be left alone nowadays and I understand it. She lives in Texas with her family.       2-25-24
Awesome
Tears but with a big smile!😢😂 I used to watch this show so many yeatrs ago with my older cousin (she's not with us anymore RIP) So many good memories
Mindy Cohn looks exactly as I imagined she would look
wow lisa whelchel is still so beautiful.
Happy birthday Drew. It was nice to see facts of life reunion
Joe was my favorite
They look great Smokin Hot.
Who is the guy with Drew? He NEEDS serious counseling and  God!! And WTF happened to Mindy? SMH
Drew Barrymore is insufferable
That dress Drew is wearing is the ugliest dress I've ever seen.  It looks like somebody raided a clothesline and sewed together strips of bedsheets.
Where is Kim Fields " Tootie"
Where was Tootie?
I grew up watching facts of life....still watch reruns and love it! Mindy is the voice of Velma in some more recent seasons of Scooby Doo shows and movies! Love all the these ladies and this show got me thru a rough childhood ❤️
Wow,it is hard to believe Drew turns 50 next year!  I assume Kim could not make it to the show.
Wow! Jo looks beautiful! I thought she would turn out weird.She is gorgeous!
Wow you got Jo - she never does anything facts of life.
They kept showing that group photo of the cast and just acted like Tootie was not even in it.😢
Wow,,, almost as fake as Ellen
Where is Tootie? Ohhh I see, not good enough for man!!
Where Tootie is?
So Awesome!! I remember the show well!! One of my favorites!! 🩷
I love watching  Lisa on Collectors  Call. Good show.
I still have a ticket to the show from the 80s, but had to take the bus back home that day.
that was great. happy birthday Drew
God awful show, just not the facts of life 🎉
Where's Kim?
Whenever there is a reunion, one of the main four girls is always missing.
Where's Kim?:
We need a full episode with these three!
where's Kim
Love this!
Oh brother ... pathetic
Happy Birthday To You Drew Barrymore 💐🎂🍨🥛
Hahaha, damn🤫🤔🎬Drew, has real stroke in showbiz.  Getting, blair, joanne, nat & tootie (usually there) together, not easy.  Esp, they're generation before drew.  🙈🙉🙊Binge watching, facts since last year.  Like, tootie almost getting abducted in new york.  Blair, changed from the different stroke crossovers.  And, her cousin geri warner was a really sweet character💋.
So glad Nancy showed. Why is there ALWAYS ONE WHO DOESN'T SHOW?? NOW ITS KIM FIELDS 😡. EMILIO ESTEVEZ is the same way with any Breakfast Club  reunions!
I remember seeing Lisa back in the early 80's on the Different Strokes series. She was hot then and hot now. I'm 61 and still crushing on her :)
Lisa is a devout Christian.. in such a Godless world of Hollywood many could learn from her and taking that stand for one’s faith
Happy Birthday Drew
♥️🙏✝️✌️😎
Drew has the most beautiful dress on  .
Blair vs Jo was more then the rich clashing with the poor it was also the new age girl against the old school girl. Blair was the traditional girl, cute and perky against Jos grumpy and tomboy ways. Jo was the voice of those challenging what was considered a woman and opened new doors for women. A show with teen stars was NBCS number 1 sitcom show just 1 year after it's 1980 revamp. By 1982 it was more popular then NBC previous smash hit and mother sitcom different strokes. In January 1981 one episode had a 27.4 rating. That is insane. That is higher then dukes of hazard rated that year, which was 27.3. If they kept those numbers they would have been in 2nd place of all tv shows. By 1988 it's ratings had dropped to 14.6
Where's tootie
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Happy birthday ❤🎂❤🎂❤🎂❤🎂❤
KOOL
🔥💜✌️❤️‍🔥😇🙏🌹🌙👑❤️‍🔥♥️🍒💋🎈🎂
Lisa and Nancy does not age! Mindy looks much older, she looks 70, it must be her hair
This was such a delight to see these ladies again. I wondered where (Tutti) was. Happy Birthday Drew.
WHERE. IS. KIM. FIELDS. AKA. TOOTIE
Where is Tootie?
Where's Tootie?
Wheres tootie???
Love this! Drew's cohost is incredibly annoying though,  why on earth is he Drew's cohost??
Awesomeness  💓💓💓💓💓💓 ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️ 💓💓💓💓💓💓
They needed Lisa Simpson to help out here - one of her accomplishments on the show was reuniting the cast of Facts of Life, including “longtime holdout Tootie.”
Surprise! This was very sweet idea but Where is Kim Fields, Where is Tootie? She was the youngest cast member and funny. Drew should NOT quit her day job to become a singer.
Any man who ends up marrying Drew is the luckiest man in the world! I mean that. She is the sweetest, kindest, most down to earth person in the industry.  Biggest heart a person could have! Love you Drew!!  ( Still hoping she ends up with Adam Sandler some day. Best match ever!) Also, anyone know why Tootie didn't show? Was there some bad blood or something?
Wish our Kim was there!!
Okay I love this reunion, but who is that sweet pupper with those beautiful ladies
Where's tuti?
Oh my God I would totally cry…I was too young when it was on but they had reruns when I was older  and I absolutely loved it.  I even loved the reunion movie but missed Jo terribly.  She was always my favorite.  Thank you so much I am stuck at home with COVID this made my day.  But where is Tootie?
Where's Kim Fields?
Where in tarnation is Tootsie
I remember Ross from a long time ago. I think it was MTV that had a contest and he didn't win but SHOULD have and look at him today.❤
Where is TOOTIE?
Gosh I loved The Facts of Life so much!! I went to a girl's boarding school at the same time the show was on. I really connected with this show.
Facts of life is where I first fell in love with gorgeous Nancy.And forever be my favorite celebrity crush 😊!!!!!
Drew dressed  as Tori Amos in her sunny Fla. Concert video?!?!?
I froze In time when they walked out...oh the sweer memories, the joy...I feel so blessed...I will forever love this show.
Where is Tootie?
Omg I’m crying 😭
They haven’t aged at all… wow!! ❤
What happen to tootsie?? Why didn’t she join
Where was Kim Feilds aka "Tootie"??
"No Tootie??" 😢😮🎉❤
Where’s Tootie?
Drew seems like a wonderful human being However is it just me or does it seem that she does most of the talking in her interviews? I'm going to stop watching because it seems like it's more about her personal therapy that she's talking out then getting to know her guests it might be just me I'm just wondering
Where’s Kim Fields?
I totally identified with jo. I finally felt a little bit normal watching,  facts of life.
Where's Trudie?
I love her show. Love from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇬🇧 xx
I love Drew and the Facts of Life ❤️❤️
Biair has not aged
Great to see Nancy
Lisa Whelchel still looks the same, she hasn't aged at all.
Where's Kim????
So they couldn't find the only black person on the show Kim Fields
Where was Kim Fields??
Where is tootie? Why is there always one girl missing at first I thought the issue was between Nancy and Lisa but now I'm starting to think maybe it's between Nancy and Kim. What's real it going on
It must be a racist thing that suck nuts at the core because why didn't they mention kim fields
I hope Kim Fields had a scheduling issue, she should have Been here with her co stars😢.
Where's Kim Fields (Tootie)?💗
Wow, was Kim Fields not a part of the cast.  I can’t believe she wasn’t there as well!  😮 I wonder if Kim was asked 🤔
Where’s Tootie!
Where's Kim Fields in this reunion!
Happy Birthday Drew Barrymore
I guess Kim didn’t want to have anything to do with this reunion. It figures! She probably has a nasty attitude.
Facts of life Lisa and nanCy McKenzie Mindy footie facts of life

WHERE IS "TOOTIE"?!! NATALIE WITHOUT TOOTIE IS NOT COOL!!!!!
Wow!  Loved this show!! Brought back good childhood memories!  Anyone else finding themselves searching for facts of life videos now?

Happy Birthday! Drew. What a awesome birthday surprise. I Loved watching The Facts Of Life. Lisa, Nancy, and Mindy look Terrific! Lisa still looks the same, amazing. Drew is so beautiful and I always love her expressions. I love her dress, it's beautiful. ❤️
Where's Tootie ?
That was pretty rad. I would be intimidated as hell to meet Blair, though.
Loved the Facts of Life ❤
Love it!!!! Grew up watching facts of life, though I had a mom and dad in the home, but felt like an outsider. Being 1 of 10 kids, I wished they would of sent me to their school
I cried!! This is amazing...
Where's Kim Fields? Happy birthday Drew

Where was Kim Fields?
Where's Kim Fields?
❤
Wow they all look so amazing 🩷 I loved that show so much.
Having them come out to the theme song made me cry.  'The Facts of  LIfe' was my show growing up and for the ladies to surprise Drew is just everything.  What an incredible moment for Drew.
Jaid should have been brought in for a reunion with Drew!
The ladies look amazing.  It was a show I grew up watching.
I wish all these ladies would do more TV 📺 movies. Love them all. I have missed Nancy McKeon alot! Happy Birthday 🎂 🥳 Drew! 💓
Was Kim Fields not invited? 😑
Happy Birthday Drew ❤
How come Tootie not there is that a true reunion 😢 I Loved the Facts Of Live ❤
These women look amazing!
Where was kim fields?
🫤.       Happy Birthday Drew.
This was fantastic, to bad Kim Fields wasn't there as well. I love The Facts Of Life and still watch it today. After The Golden Girls it's my second favorite show of all time. How cool would it be if the did a Golden Girls type show with the Facts cast.
Never more than today in this economy that the words "Facts of Life" reigns so true. We miss you Kim Fields.
where is tootie kim fields at
who is this flamming fanuke on her show at the beginning??? good God Drew....get some freaking morals
Where's Kim?
I thought she was going to say Charlotte Rae's ashes were in that bag.
👏🏼👏🏻👍🏼👍🏻💞💕❤💋
Her joy just radiates from her. And that dress is So perfect for her vibe! Happy Day. She deserves it. 🤟🏻🌟💫✌🏻🕯
Lisa Whelchel looks almost the exact same as 40+ years ago. It's insane. That's definitely a Blair Warner-approved hairstyle too lol.
I LOVED The Facts of Life! What an amazing surprise! I would love to see all of them on tv again!
Blair (Lisa) is still so beautiful, Jo (Nancy) looks fantastic and Natalie (Mindy) is fearce! Im sure Tootie (Kim) was there in spirit! ❤ RIP Charolette Rae. ❤All of you look absolutely amazing!!! ❤
so kim fields is a figment of my imagination. got it.
Where’s Tootie?’
Happy birthday Drew. I loved the facts of life show. I grew up watching it. And Jo was my favorite. Though I loved them all.
So wonderful to see! All my childhood heros! What Drew said...
My favorite show. Joe was my favorite 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Happy Birthday Drew Barrymore ❤️🎂🎁🎈🎈🎈🎊🎊

Where's tootie?
Nancy 🎉 ❤
Wow. This was also my favorite TV show growing up. I identified with Nancy's characher of Joe.  I never thought  about why I love the show so much.  Drew's thoughts about family and not being part of the traditional family nailed it for me.  I am sure this show saved so many latch key kids from feeling even more alone.
Drews bday outfit is so cute❤️🩷🧡💛💚💙🩵💜 Happy birthday Drew from 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🫶🏻💛💛
Happy awesome Birthday!!  You really do deserve this- even if you don’t believe it.  Believe.  You’ve grown so much and have persevered in life, love and kindness!  Squeeze to you- Happy Bday Drew!!!🌺

My favorite show growing up too.  Drew you were so spot on…on what the facts of life meant to people.  Such a great moment

❤Drew ❤
When I see skinny celebrities, all I see is Ozempic.
What a wonderful birthday present!!🥳
Oh my shis kabob! What an epic bday surprise for Drew ❤🔥 I luv them all
Drew is such an 80s kid
I shall propose a toast. To all of the days Drew has been running the show on the air and made Curious George with Will Ferrell (which is my favorite movie) it has been a very good time with this adorable 49-year-old actress. And she has made a lot of good movies in the past. And all of the hugs we want to give her. Except for her dumb sidekick, Ross. And watching this show is so great! Here's to Drew for a happy birthday! L' chaim! 🎂🥳🎊🥂
Drew always has the right things to say. Happy Birthday babe🥳
So nice! Happy Birthday Drew! Love "The Facts of Life"! ❤
Happy Birthday!! I love you Drew!!
So wonderful to see!
Good to see Nancy. I hope theres more of this interview on here somewhere.
Happy Birthday Drew!!!    I LOVED The Facts of Life!!! My favorite character was 'Jo' Nancy McKeon, what a SURPRISE to see her all these years later looking just the same as back then. Everyone in the stage today were BEAUTIFUL! ❤️❤️
Missed Tootie..
I met Lisa Whelchel and she’s so kind. Drew was so grateful as always.
I love Natalie’s cool art professor style!
0:06 Drew loves practically everything! She is enthusiasm personified.
I think it would be awesome if they brought back The facts but with the characters children going to school
I don't think the character of Blair played by Lisa whelchel has ever aged what is your secret you look like you did from the first episode of facts of Life also Joe and Natalie what is your guy's secret please tell me
It makes total sense why Drew was a big fan.  Female friendship, found family dynamic, and a mother figure.  Facts of Life was an inspiration to many...and Drew is a big example of how a show can influence someone.
Happy B Day Drew Facts of life is and always will be the best show on Tv alot of the Tv shows from this era iare
Drew’s dress is so perfect for her b day
Happy birthday Drew!  You share a birthday with my mom, wishing her a happy heavenly birthday.
😂😂😂 I love this episode. This was my favorite show growing up.❤
Too bad Kim Fields wasn't there.
Happiest Birthday Drew!! 🥳I'm literally smiling ear to ear. THIS was my show!!! I grew up with these three...and Tootie!! Where the sexiest man alive got his start!! 🤣❣❣ The Facts ladies all look LOVELY!!!
