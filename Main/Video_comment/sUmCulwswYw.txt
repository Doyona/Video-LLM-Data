Lol its exciting huh well you might be getting another exciting night haha
So we are not going to talk about the blatent Elbow that put Eubank down in the first fight?
There is a great level of respect between these two that's great to watch.
Ooh you’re hard…..showing off
Talks a good game eubank ha
Everyone here was going for Chris in the first fight now they hop sides   😂
chris is funny
Eubank stop imitating another man style of fighting get your own style you're proving  Billy Joe the boxer  right about you he said you're a good fighter but you're not a boxer
Avoid them elbows this time.
Chalk and cheese. Like them both for very different reasons. Looking forward to the rematch.
How old is this Liam smith guy😂
Liam about to retire Eubank!
Chris Eubank Jr was never great but he always had a great engine and chin, that's gone now, he's washed up, he ain't the same fighter
Same outcome here, a win. Might be on points but Smith is a proper boxer. Through and through.
boxing is in the gutter imo if this fight is ppv ?
Floyd mayweather did lose tho…when he was amateur
Only Chris could still go down the wind up merchant route after that fight. Love it
I'm a eubank fan but he got saved there
Delusional 🤦‍♂️
How Lovely Is Chris JR Such A Lovely Guy Who Is Not A Big Head Like Half The Boxers Out There He Is So Honest In What He Says Everytime I Hear Him He Sounds More Like His Dad Chris Eubank Chris Is Such A Gorgeous Guy Love Him 💕♥️♥️💕💋💋I Cannot Stand Liam Even When Chris Loses A Fight It Takes It Like A Man He Dosent Sulk Or Have An Attitude If He Loses He Takes It Gracefully
Chris will get ko out
Good salesmen!if u lie to urself you haveno chsnce
Floyd perception lol
Where did it get heated? Missed that bit!
Whss as t a pr…k
Nothing about this presser is heated !   Wtf has this world come too
Theres not a shred of being humbled by Eubank here and i believe that will be his downfall again, i just wonder if he will get himself to 75% this time.
He sounds really in denial hereat first I thought it was optimism, but he just sounds like his confidence has been crushed.
Hel gets knocked out again and it’s game over
Even in defeat the scouser is still rattled
I must have watched a different fight to Eubank because in the fight that I watched Eubank copped a whack on the chin and his legs turned to jelly and he fell over and didn’t know what day of the week it was 🤪
Haven't they just fought? What  a joke.
How the HELL was that a heated press conference?? Probably one of the most respectful pressers I've seen 😂😂😂
Can't wait for part two
This eubank is rubbish
Wtf is this real 😂
Dont ever bring a towel to my fight again lol
Love both these guys, tell you what, only fight I'll be paying to watch this year!!!!! Worth every penny, at least you know your gonna get to see a good scrap.....👊😎
God I hate Liam Smith 😂
Chris has a unique ability to scare people into thinking he’s holding something back and that he’s better than what they see. It’s a mind game thing but really he was just smashed by a better fighter
I could've carried on after we both went dwn,😂😂 only you went dwn seeing stars
absolute nonsense as always from eubank it's all a act but knowing who his dad is it's no surprise tho
Wordsmith at work
Superior wind up merchant  Average boxer
KFCD - Kentucky Fried Chicken Dance.
Two fighters who know how the game works, verbal sparing but still showing each other the respect that is their due. This is the way that all fight pressers should go.
😂
Hope Liam knocks that smug div out. Such an egotistic arrogant mediocre fighter.
Chris is the def the best wind up merchant in the sport and def is selling what should just be a repeat of the first fight.  He’ll never be his father but he has made a tidy bit of coin and to date still as sharp as ever when talking.
is this fight ever going to happen. seems like its been a good year and a bit the build up.
This fight does not need to happen pride sometimes gets in the way of people’s judgment 🙏
He just talks in riddles Eubank, out classed by smith last time. First it was an elbow, now it’s the referee.  Same again Beefy 💪🏽
Eubank jr is clutching at straws here  Chris you got finished mate  And you’ll get dropped again
Good press conference. Chris seems pretty humble and Liam trying to make him say it is hilarious 😂👌
This time     Eubank  will  win   ' hes   training  with  his  dad  and listening   '  watch    but dont blink  !!
Ref why you stop it, chris was going to knock him out
chris is  g
Sounds like Ty and Robbie from AFTV!
Summary,Chin,buzz and a lack of towels
Chris eubanks water was to wet also thats why he got beat up
Heated? Seen more heat in an igloo
STORY TIME!!!! with Chris Eubank😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah Eubank had a brief bit of joy with the left Jab in the 3rd but for the most part he was using it to keep Liam at distance defensively rather than on the front foot setting up the next combination. Of the left uppercuts he only managed to land one clean and the others just grazed the target as Liam slipped them. Liam destroyed him as soon as he got inside and put some power on the timing with the left uppercut that ended it as a contest.
That was so heated
You just can’t help but like Eubank more the more he gets older
Ref nade the right decision, ;he had his dancing shoes on
Naseem said Jnr was deluded
Talks really well,conducts himself well, not your average boxer.
Nomatter what anyone says they're two decent lads
No respect for brown people anymore.
They both know it was an elbow that knocked him out, fair play that Chris didn’t mention it. He was buzzed with the punch before the elbow but it was that  blow that ended the fight. I actually quite like them both, very different but decent guys and well matched fighters.
Looking forward to this but Eubank is a terrible boxer and I can’t see anything but the same result
Chris Eubank jr is definitely growing on me,looking forward to a great rematch
Chris is such a class act ❤
Gotta love Eubank he's to funny 😂
I’m not a lover of Chris but it looks completely unfazed and I like it 👏👏
He underestimated his competition and we’re here now…
Eubank is full of deluded nonsense, he got beat and that’s simply it. Smith is the better fighter and always will be.
Think Chris might do himself a favour by not devouring that crappy 'food' he keeps advertising . Then get down to some serious hard work .
Man if Chris could fight as well as he talks he’d be one of the goats😂
THAT was NOT heated come on sky i expect better from yous
What weight is the fight at ?
I'll be back from Turkey for this. I might get a tickets. Whoop whoop tasty🎉
Chris enjoyed being dropped?. I've never heard that one before.
Chris well said very good sports man and nice to see no bodys angry
Hopefully Chris will go all out and train to 55% this time.
Even May weather has lost, in the amateurs he has apparently loss 6 fights, I only knew about his lost to Serafim Todorov until today 🙏🏼
Chris Eubank Jr has always been a hype job, simple as.
I do like Jr., I'd like to see these two fight again for sure.  May the best man win :)
Liam got robbed of a devastating knock out which was seconds away when it was stopped 🥴🤛
Chris gets ironed out absolutely NO DANGER
I enjoyed....  Eubanks eye  😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Pointless fight that Smith really doesn't need. Beat him convincingly last time
Eubank must still be concussed
Chris just cracks me up. I do wish he’d fulfil his potential.
Chris is so humble
Can. Not. Wait.
For the first time EVER I want Eubank to win and I am a Nigel Benn fan!
If there is no elbows Chris wins.... it was a cheeky move lije when footballers leave the leg to get contact hard for ref to say its intentional but we all know it was same with that elbow... end of... i hooe liam fights clean this time as he seems a stand up guy
Obviously Chris won’t win the rematch but I do love how he sells a fight
I've got stuff in my freezer more heated than this
"what a strange inquiry that was" Sounds just like Eubank Snr. Got to love it
Chris took loss like a true G
I must have missed the heated bit....
No KFC coat this time. That has to be worth at least a point.
Chris winning the IBO belt will be the highlight of his career
Eubank jnr is literally the 2.0 version of his dad.
🙏This made me like chis junior now,  well said son🎤 🥊hope you win your next fight💯
Nobody is as Good as Chris thinks He is..
He said it with a straight face LOL!
Sometimes it's hard to realise what has happened when you've been KO'd and haven't watched the fight + you don't believe what people are saying 😁
joe Calzaghe also eubank undefeated
Unless your Floyd mayweather ? How about joe calzaghe who whipped your old man 46 and 0 go joe ☝️ best British fighter I’ve seen in my opinion 👍
Same outcome he’s getting smashed again
Chris is a character he may not be the best but he's always entertaining and that's what boxing is entertainment. If you don't like Eubank jr don't watch it's not difficult. The hate is unnecessary.
Don't ever bring a towel to any of my flights again I'm done 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t see why he needs to hold his ego high, you lost mate, if you became humble you’d have so many more fans
Robbed 😂 you was absolutely gone
Heated? Both seemed fairly relaxed to me.
Chris hilarious again!!..👍
Eubanks is delusional, he's got to sell the fight, but Smith walked him to the ropes all through the short amount of time he lasted, forget jabbing his head off, you allowed him to dictate. Another Smith win for me, jnr will be on his toes this time & try to avoid Smith, but later rounds Smith gets him.
The delusion....is real
0:33 or CALZAGHE
stop trying to fight like R jones...might help
Unless you are  Mayweather or Tyson Fury or Joe Calzaghe or Rocky Marceano
Come on chris just admit you got done
Eubank is kidding himself, he’s gonna get knocked out again
Dear me ,has Chris learnt anything ?  1st - admit you got beat by the better man , there is no shame in that . Ali - sugar ray leonard , and sugar ray robinson , all lost,  but be a man , and accept it . After all liam smith is an ex world champion , and a very well schooled fighter . Chris needs to start with that . Deluding himself that he could have made a comeback is laughable , he could have got seriously hurt  And some of the fanboys are still buying his words   I picked smith last time , but  on points . This time I think it will be a longer fight , but smith wins again . Chris eubank jr selling point is now over  The granite chin has been exposed . I hope they both make a lot of money from the rematch , and walk away 100% healthy . The best Chris can hope for is a 3 round shoot out , as I said last time .
TEAM EUBANK
Chris is the best promoter in the game😂 but Liam beats him again
Chris eubank jr, handled that sooo well.
Chris eubank jr, handled that sooo well.
Man gotta love Chris even in defeat guy knows how to market and sell fights. The towel line was hilarious
Chris you are a fighting family if you are going to win you need your father to be there good luck both fighters still very interesting fight to watch.
Gotta love chris ❤
Got to give credit to Chris Jnr for his attitude here.
"The ref robbed me"  "Roy was on the apron waving the towel" 😂😂😂😂😂
0-3 against live opponents and his punch resistance looks to have deserted him. A lot of talk and then another crushing defeat for Eubank who will then be 0-4 against top quality opposition.
Where was the clash?
Well prepare told hold yourself again 😂😂😂😂😂 never been world class best eubanks has ever been is European class If the last fight had continued you would have ended up in hospital
Eubank Jr is Comedy Gold
He got beat but cough with a elbow
Plus Andre Ward , Joe Calzaghe
He's a worse fighter by Roy Jones guidance if I'm honest. He was a very exciting fighter I enjoyed his countless upper cut in a single fight. Roy need to go
Watch them elbows
Chris has a good mentality and has immense confidence, although he does believe in his own hype I still think smith will win again
Eubank won the first fight ….watch it back 🙄
Thought CB was gonna win the first fight, can't see him winning the Rematch.
Ringing Ryan Garcia.....😂😂😂😂
He’s 100% value eubank,imagine what he’d be like if he was really really good….totally unbearable.
The referee stopped me not you 😂 what a wet wipe
This is bellew haye all over again
Chris just retire
Which part was heated? They’re best buds now
Tbf the ref was well within his rights to stop it after the first knock down. He didn’t return to his corner and he didn’t give the ref his gloves when he asked. It should have been stopped then.
He never accepted the Saunders loss, though
Delusional
What date is the rematch
knock em out Chris again like you would ave last time  !! you was robbed with that dirty elbow !!   Don't be so civil an nice this time with MMA fighter !!  that werent no Queensbury rules and you aint no Queen !  You is a King Chris and Remember that always mate !!
There both cracking up
HEATED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t mind Chris but all that paper and still… 1 furry collared jacket.
Heated presser ? Clashed ?? Where ? I’m still waiting , false headlines for clickbait
Loads more respect from both sides good to see 😊
Is this ppv?
Chris is jokes😂
liam showed jnr up for the fraud he has become, yes he could have a fight back in the day, but he is getting old and no longer has the stamina, or the heart for a scrap, he fights for money alone. liam will spark him again, he should retire a rich man. have kfc took the jacket back ?.
Not another Jeffrey Dahmer fruit punch 2
Jr will win this time he knows where he went wrong. Just unfortunate he could of been world champ long time ago.
Chris needs to come back stronger but unless Connor Benn helps him then it's not going to be physically possible.
Rumor is this Eubwanks fella has never known a womans warmth...
I don’t think Eubank knows how to act now his aurora of invincibility has been took away from him, he look’s beaten already in my eyes
Would love Liam Smith to get scranned to bits
Eubank has Ryans number?
Throw Roy under a bus Chris. Very very poor!
Eubank knows what he's doing😂😂he's a quality act give him that. Very subtle n doesn't break character hahahah
Hahaha I like Chris Eubank these days,,he is more matured mentally
Chris not mentioning the elbow.. but everyone knows what he’s driving at
He got buzzed by George Groves and actually touched down in That fight. Respect to Eubank for actually getting back in there. Also think liam will have to much for him again.
Chris is the man  Father must be proud
SMITH 2 WIN AGAIN 👌💯
Should not have taken this rematch will go exactly same way…
“You win some, you lose some, you live to fight another day!”
Liam actually enjoyed Chris's humour..
Nearly every comment is about Eubank
Twas a nice elbow though
Thought for sure he would say Smith caught him with an elbow
even after losing, Chris still manages to be a wind up 🤣🤣
Wow Chris so good with words he sold me already.😂
Eubank is pantomime, not a top boxer.
Let’s think safety first  because now we have another day to see a great fight again . I look forward to it , May the best man win and all be safe
‘Robbed of the opportunity to finish me conclusively’? The man was like Bambi on ice.
Eubanks ❤
Reminds me of the buildup to Bellew Haye 2
They should stop all these rematch clauses unless it's a controversial decision full stop,this was clear KO. What about all those fighters who have waited years for a big fight or title shot.😮
I must have missed the bit where it got HEATED like it says in the title.
Yea that was so heated 😂
What a sausage probably still believes in Santa aswell
Heated?!
If chris spoke like this since day 1 there might be a few more people not wanting to see him get the pasting he got
Love the Eubanks. They've provided us with top class entertainment for years. And thats all it is folks just a game.
More fried chicken 🍗 🐔 😋
Chris still as entertaining as ever 😂😂😂
I thought it was a joke. Ffs.
Eubank was genuinely winning before the knockout, but the knockout makes whatever happened prior irrelevant. To me, Chris is the sharper stronger fighter and i personally see him winning the rematch then the 3rd fight and continuing his career.
Chris u r a propa helmet 😂😂
Eubank ain’t got the boxing iQ to beat Smith.. Eubank is a warrior and has plenty of heart that’s it .. can’t deny he’s very entertaining though 🤣🤣🤣🥊🥊
Who thinks he really spoke to Ryan Garcia
Haha! Fair play to Eubank.
Scouse power you have more heart than him lad, Liam give it to him again, shut him up. love ye lad and ye family proud scouser. from usa,
😂😂😂
Wheres the heated bit
Chris, I wanted you to win but it was a good stoppage.  I hope you win the rematch 👊
lol i love it this is going to be fun to watch lol .
No "heat" in this presser at all 😂
Eubank is a little delusional but i’m not mad at that. An a top level boxer you need to be a little delusional I think.
LOL Eubank was all over the place! There is NO WAY he could have continued hahahaha Liam will do the same again, but a bit later!
If he thinks he is a better fighter, maybe he won't change.  And, experience the same downfall twice.
I don't Chris will be frying steaks saying hes going to season Smith this time 🤣
Everyone gets buzzed when hit with an elbow 😊
Chris jr could always pursue a career in Shakespearean theatre if this doesnt work out 😅
Who do you think will win the rematch ?
As likeable as chris is he speaks out the hole in his arse
Another 30 seconds Chris would have been out cold.
Was surprised smith beat eubank, looking 4ward to the re adjustments in the rematch
I dominated the first 3 rounds The ref robbed me  I didn’t know til now Roy was about to throw the towel in  Gotta hand it to him Chris is totally delusional 💯
Smith wins again even easier this time
The ref saved his backside he should be thanking the referee for not getting more hurt.
50 50 I say
Cwis getting done Again.
Jr reckons he enjoyed that fight with smith 😂🤥
If Eubank defended himself in the fight like he did in this presser he would of won.
IMO it’s a massive mis-match! Liam is such a better boxer!!! I predict a better finish by Liam 👊🏾
There’s only one Roy Jones - you can’t mimic him.  If Chris can get back to Chris and Roy can help him do this, he’d have a better chance imo
no need for this fight at all
Can't take Chris serious anymore. Total hype job
Chris needs to accept his technical knockout loss, he was saved from being put to sleep by beefy boi, the silver cut beefy boi will strike again in this fight!
I was gutted the first fight didn't go 8-9 rounds but at least we get to see them again.
Watch in 1.25x speed
Chris will destroy Smith this time
He made the Ref. stop you, bro! One of the important jobs of the Ref. & the corner is to protect the Fighter from himself.
Everyone wants Eubank jnr to go back to his old style. Be an explosive fighter.
Eubank actually won the first fight until 😂
Chris has the real fighters fighting spirit. Like wilder he wanted to go out on his shield. This man’s game!!!
Delusions of grandeur in this guy is of the scale😂
Chris is really growing on me
The headline is pure Clickbait. No heat at all.
3:38 noticed when watching this presser live that Eubank took this question super personal for some reason
This is a joke of a fight. We were supposed to be getting good fights, not repeats.
Good luck tryna sell yourself this time Chris😊
What I will give Jr is that he has grown out of his father's shadow over the course of his career, and that in itself is a worthy accomplishment
I can see these two be good friends in a feed years time
Ok Christopher 😂
Chris has pulled a worldie here, fella got knocked out clean but he’s made it sound like nothing happened 😂😂😂
Chris was beaten conclusively from what I saw but I think he wins the rematch, deluded in his accessment
wow chris eubank jr needs to give aj lessons in how to take a loss
Pointless these two trying to hype the rematch. They shook hands and acknowledged each other warmly after their first fight, now they are going through the pretence that there is genuine animosity between them.  Boxing enthusiasts aren’t fools and can see through these charades so please don’t insult our intelligence. Eubank to win with a late stoppage and a third fight in the summer in the open air is my prediction.
Scarily SCARILY DELUDED
When Beefy KO’s Ewbank again perhaps that will quiet him but I doubt it 😂😂😂
I don't think a KFC diet will work this time Chris. Good, solid training. Weights, cardio, sparring. And you must 100%, not 30.😅😅😂
You was wobbling all over Chris you was done
Brilliant at saling a fight and always exciting to watch
Nobody wants to see this rematch,why are there so many these uk fights,that boxing fans here in the states have very little interest,for example,if the khan vs brook fight would have happened in vegas,barely anyone would have watched it,but over in the uk theyre was still demand for that fight,dillian whyte vs Aj rematch is another fight eddie hearn still keeps tryin to set up,no one wants to see that one either
I love that saying it’s Chris just being Chris 😢
Testament to Chris Jr that he has made as much money out of his dads name as he has with just hard work but with not much actual skill. How is this fight even happening?
Simply the best - amazing humble guy. Love me a bit of Eubank
He’s embarrassed to say about the headbutt that never even happened 🤣🤣
Joe calzaghe also retired undefeated just saying, floyds not the only one to do it probably the greatest to do it but not the only one
Eubank Jr will suffer the same fate. Predicted last time and was laughed at, they didn’t laugh at the bookies though. The foolish talk saying the last fight was stopped to early, was is only hope of selling the fight.
😂 smith has broken Eubank!
😂Eubank knocks him out in this one lol. A hope not but just got this itch
There's a lot more respect between them this time round
Still waiting for it to get heated...
Jr is box office 😂👏
You've gotta love Chris 😂😂😂 He's quality mate
Hardly heated 🙄
Chris Eubank Jr in huge denial still..
Right I give in. I have disliked Eubank Junior for too long. Gained a fan! 🎉
At the end of the day, tony bellew got back to his wife & kids safely? And that’s all we should really care about.
I think Chris has a point. He has not been knocked down before and could have recovered. I believe he deserves the rematch. But I hope his father trains him instead of this open style of fighting that will end in the same result.
Talks a good game eubank but he crnt box . Retire pal
Tbh I'd rather see Eubank Jr vs Benn
You didn't get robbed Chris you got saved for another day
Liam smith knew how he won 🥇 love to see Eubank take the win for a trilogy
Its gonna be another gd fight  looking forward to it, the towel comment was mint
What's in boxing for Chris Jnr if he loses again to Liam Smith, where does he go from there?.....
This is mustard. These boys are made for each other.
What is Bono doing sitting next to Eubank
Chris overlooked him maybe better fight but same outcome
Everything eubank said here was right.
Chris don't let liam on the inside because he does his best work there and that's where you got caught last time so keep him on the end of the jab were you had success .you can win this we are routing for you 😊
Before there last fight is Chris Eubank said he could beat Liam Smith if he was less than 50% fighting fit so I bet this time he’ll make sure he 100% fighting fit
Chris is funny as 😂. Would love to see James Smith as his nutritionist and PT 😂 they would be a great comedy duo 😅
I just can’t help but like Eubank Jr. Bit of a melon, but a quality wind-up merchant.
Wheres the heat 😂 none
Smith stops him again.
Eubank was walking around that ring like Ozzy ozbourne 🤣🤣🤣
I've had ice cream more heated than that. 🥴
Club Deluded
Heated presser? Clash at launch? Lol - really? That was incredibly sporting, good natured and even humorous - heated it was not. Both these guys are seasoned pro's - neither is going to be a world champion - but this is an interesting and saleable fight -  lets not say its heated though......
Where’s the clash ?
Why private the press conference? Was in the middle of watching it.
Chris talking like Mayweather is the only one who hasn't lost a fight, theres TysonFury, Usyk, Rocky Marciano, Calzaghe etc.
Where's Adam Smith?
Eubank is too drained at this weight. I can see the same happening again
Clearly never heard of the unbeaten rocky marciano. Who wasnt a woman beater like Mayweather.
Roy is not the trainer for Chris.
Dont ever bring a towel to any of my fights ever again 😂😂😂 big line
Jeez eubank looks like a different man. He looks shifty and on edge. Even he doesn't believe his own hype anymore.
Where is the presser then
The most deluded boxer in the history of this sport 🤦‍♂️
God damn Chris is good at selling fights. Everyone else needs to take note
Ending he held himself well.
quality interview
Ref saved you're life Chris you looked like a dear on ice
Heated presser!!! Yerrrrrrrr hole
I like the way Eubank defends himself.
Except it wasn't heated at all in any way. Why lie in your title ffs, just put pressure conference highlights you melons 😂
Ngl elbow done serious damage n I don’t even like junior
The elbow done the damage
when liam asked him if he got knocked out in sparring in their previous fight....eubank's pause and him repeating that same question, said it al to me!
There are no winners in this, absolutely nobody 🥱🥱🥱
Eubank wouldn't of made it out of round 4 lmao
Exciting getting dropped? That’s a first
Noble and honorable in defeat. Its only a game (and business) and Liam was nice too so thank you for that!
Disappointed Eubank has kept Roy Jones on. Baffled 🙈
Good luck selling this
Anything other than a Jr KO or stoppage means retirement time
The elbow dropped Chris nothing else
