okay let me start with i love pentatonix. been watching them since i was in middle school when my choir teacher showed us wizard of ahh's (masterpiece) but checking back in with them in my mid twenties, the lip syncing kills me!!!! mitch i want to see them neck veins!!! scott i needed more. ugh i feel like such a LOSER. still great work. love them forever.
Every time we touch came out early 2000s.
Glee, eres tú?
"Feels so good" get far too few mentions in these comments. But it's the only track I need a full version of! :D
Human instruments only?
uff, long time not hearing you guys, but this is amasing, am totally back
Eu escuto Pentatonix desde a adolescência 🖤🌹
LOVE IT!
🌎🌍🌎🌍🌎🌍
Mi piace tantoooooooooooooooo
I've never heard of you. But what's good is good.
No Spice Girls No Backstreet Boys No Captain Jack No Aqua No Fun Factory No Alexia  You have to do your homework
Going for the James Corden look I see there Scott.
The song “believe “ makes me feel emotional 😭  What a time to be alive 😅
Why are they not mixed together ? Like the daft punk one. This is more collage than medley
💔  boom boom boom boo.  I was so disappointed  with it.  However. Love the rest of it.
Я просто погрузился в атмосферу 90-х и вспомнил эти безумные для меня годы,спасибо Пентатоникс,люблю вас!!!❤
😔Can find it on Spotify ☹️. ❤️
Lol I love how half of these songs are in Night at the Roxbury
OMG is a great  song 🎵 you must be the only thing that we know that is the most beautiful place of of of 7and and and the two two the best best best have the best of 😮all of us for you are to get to get to your house to take the time and take the most part of it and we can go over the process of the time that we are not sure what to do 7th y the us us up 7th grade 😀 ❤ 💙 😊 💜 ♥ ♥ 😀 ❤ 💙 😊
2:56 ooooh yeaaaah
Ace of Base, more please!!
4 years late, but thank you youtube recommendations
❤
Ouvindo em 26/9/025. Lindo esplêndido.
Yall screwed up you called it a 90s medley but there are 2000s dance hits in there. Just call it a dance medledy, dont date it. Cause i grew up in the 90s and yall are wrong!!
THAT WAS FABULOUS!!!!!!!
Thank you! Excellent coverage. 🇦🇺
waaauw Kirstin, Kevin and Scott look so cute/hot in this clip😍
I love this song. This is the best song ever.❤❤❤
Great Medley 😊❤
Wait a dang minute... Y'all both sing and LOOK beautifully?? Complete cheat code
Twenty years later and I still think I’m better off alone. That being said good lord that girl singing soprano is beautiful.
Amazing 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
👍
I love Mitch so much! His voice so versatile
You simply make better my days!!! ❤❤❤
1:53 🔥
❤
Hey boy and girl
Are they using any instruments?
love you guys, just leave the autotune.... you guys are amazing
Pentatonix is my favorite band! I've been listening to your songs for two years!
When is Pentatonix gonna do a Nickelodeon Acapella Medley?❤️📺🎶👍🏻
i love the 90''s best year ever
As a living treasure trove of basically all 90s pop, a huge Pentatonix fan, and fan of all things a cappella, this hit all of the right notes (no pun intended). I mean, when the opening song is what any 90s techno fan should call the primary anthem of our people (first 8 of Be My Lover), you know you’re listening to some legitimate, fan-generated compilation and not some AI soulless mix.
Genial como siempre, aunque algunos temas no sean de la decada del 90 más bien de los 2000 pero joyas igual ❤
Вас вітаю з України! Давно люблю Вашу групу! Ви дійсно найкращі!!!💛💙💛💙💛💙💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋😍🤩🥰Дякую за творчисть!Бажаю й надалі ВСІМ ВАМ  натхнення та наснаги у всьому!З любов,ю Лара з Сумщини( Україна)😘😘😘😘😘
Nooooooo! It ended!! 😢
Here's a thought - A retro-night on Tomorrowland with a DJ dueling Pentatonix
I swear the guy in the yellow jacket is the spitting image of Snow - Informer.

Great work! But you're missing the GOATS of 90s dance: "Another Night" by Real McCoy and "This is Your Night" by Amber.
Still 🔥
It sounds good, but it also sounds so auto tuned 😂
The blond guy is  SO cute and hot ❤
I reeeeeeeeealy wish this was on Spotify!

Muito bom 😮😍✨✨
😉👍
Why she is so goddess?
Unique  voices Pentatonix
Me encantan esas songs de los 90, que recuerdos …❤
Bailando en Cuba🇨🇺
Just watched this again and had a great idea.  This year is the 30th anniversary of A GOOFY MOVIE, which had some amazing 90's dance music in it (songs like Stand Out, I2I, by Tevin Campbell among others) and Disney is doing a big publicity push on that movie right now. What if Pentatonix did a cover of some of those songs, especially the aforementioned Tevin songs, or perhaps a medly of the entire soundtrack?
I just realized the Cascada song they sung "Every time we touch" came out in 2006 so its not technically 90's. I wonder why they put that in.
I love this video so much! The selection of songs reminds me of my childhood! ❤
saludos desde colombia
Bravo!
So much european songs
Aquí 2025 saludos desde cuba
Most FUN of all your creations. ❤
Full version of Alice Deejay better off alone! I grew up at like 10 or 11 years old loving that album!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ argentina
Amazing! Good job!  I will be very glad if you remember also the following tracks from 90s  Backstreet Boys - I want it that way Los Del Rio - Macarena Michael Jackson - They do not care about us (espessialy interesting to listen percussion party from this song executed by your band :)) Mr. President - Coco Jambo DJ BoBo - Somebody dance with me ...
Can we agree that 90s Eurodance was one of the best chapters in music history?
PERFEITOOOOOOOO
Que saudades dessas músicas! Amei
April 2025 😊
April 2025: Scott... Looking fine, yes, please. Can I just keep his outfits here?
17/04/2025 5:30am fire on my morning going to the gym with this classic
After watching their live performances, I’m so glad I’ve never paid money to see them live! This sounds great and they’re obviously talented but this just proves how much engineering and production goes into the final piece of music. Stick to albums and don’t tour cos it’s obvious that you aren’t going to sound as good as
Who is from 2025?
Wow, großartig
Amo ouvir eles ,me deixa feliz
Exactly 4years
Просто потрясно!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 👍👍👍👏👏👏Не хотелось, чтобы заканчивалось это  🤗🤗😎

Amazing...Back in 1990s when I was the lead vocalist of a famous Pakistani band named, Fringe Benefits International,I used to be called a human harmonizer by my musician colleagues (bcz of my harmony singing skills there weren't any auto-tuners back then) but this...Pentatonix is next level band....Wow 😮❤
🎉🎉🎉good🎉🎉🎉
2025 🙋🏻‍♀️

When they use autotune it kinda defeats the purpose and complexity of an A Capella group. Disappointing.
Me 2025🎉🎉

ケヴィン沼
can you do sunroof pls im a biggest fan of you i love you guys so much
Pentatonix you guys should get together with the Piano Guys and make some music.
I don’t really have to comment about the amazing talent of this group. Outside of that it’s not crazy to say that the all around music of the 90s has to be in the the greatest if not THE greatest decades of all time.
Just amazing..
I miss the messy and unedited feel of stuff like Evolution of Music 8 years ago
i love yoy guys!
LOS AME!!!! Son mis favoritos desde que los descubrí, saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷 ❤
Cascada 2000's !!
Most are from early 2000s - I’m expecting like 1994 hits- I worked in a night club lol I know when they were popular

DJ PRECISE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
They never fail to amaze me.
holy crap! this is what I call a proper homage to the 90s songs!
Cascada ce n'est pas année 90
THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE, I had only heard "Believe" by Cher and if I hadn't taken the time I wouldn't get to enjoy these beautiful voices.   Again, thank you!!!!
Avi Kaplan the best
Yes!! Nostalgia overload, awesome job.

Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh  Dum dum dum dum La la la la la, it's all around the world Just la la la la la, and everybody's singing  Do you think you're better off alone? Do you think you're better off alone?  Everybody dance now give me the music Everybody dance now  Rhythm is a dancer it's a soul's companion You can feel it everywhere Lift your hands and voices Free your mind and join us You can feel it in the air  Boom boom boom boom i want you in my room Let's spend the night together From now until forever boom boom boom boom I wanna go boom boom Let's spend the night together Together in my room  Your love, it feels so good And that's what takes me high Higher than I've been before It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh oh Baby  I still hear your voice when You sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive  'Cuz everytime we touch i get this feeling And everytime we kiss i swear I could fly Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last need you by my side  I'm blue da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di da ba dee da ba di  Deep inside deep deep down inside  You've got to show me love, oh Heartbreaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving my love And getting nowhere, nowhere  Waiting for tonight, oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight  It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  Do you believe in life after love? (Life after love) I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're Strong enough now  La da dee la dee da la da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da la da dee la dee da  Finally you've come along The way I feel about you It just can't be wrong If you only knew the way I feel about you I just can't describe it, oh no no  Finally it has happened to me Right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it Finally it has happened to me Right in front of my face and I just can not hide it finally
Where is the list of all the songs! I know almost all of them but would love to have an actual song list like they've done for songs like this in the past.
Never been more disappointed, maybe stick to musical theatre...
MORE MORE MORE!! Pretty please!
THAT WAS ONE BIG PLANK OF CHEESE, REALY GOOD AND VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEESE! i loved the cheese
Autotune sounds amazing when the singer can actually sing.
Still here 2024 😊❤
😁
ฟังเพลงแล้ว นึกถึงสมัยวัยรุ่น เราว่าภาษาอังกฤษ สอนเรื่องแกรมม่าได้ดีนะ ฟังเข้าใจง่ายกว่าเพลงสมัยนี้
Ok for the acapela, but everything else, the voice effects, nothing is natural
🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥
Flawless, as always. I'm not sure how I feel about them altering their voices though. I mean, it's on brand for the music, but they are known for a dance club sound without the use of any alterations. I'm old, sue me :D
2:15 this song was released in 2005. The song it samples was 90s. Show Maggie Reilly some respect.
This mashup is so damn good!! 🥰💖🤌🏾
please make "be my lover" full, so cool
No way! So much vocal technique is overwhelming! My respects!

The acoustics are astounding.  Why did we ever invent musical instruments when this kind of talent is already onboard!
The best medley ever!! 🔥🔥 First medley that I know absolutely every song haha!
2024 button :
I think this is in my top 5 Pentatonix favorites <3 I love the video and their outfits along with the music. They did such a great job with all of these songs.
05:04 epic transition!
Can I get the names of all the songs in this medley please? 🥺
Coś wspaniałego 🥰😍
This is one lit Zoom meeting!

They are killing it😭♥️
I want you all to know that you are teaching me how to love again after many breakups and a divorce. Thank you😊
Costumer always nail these videos.  Second only to the vocals.
1:57 🎉
This video is for gays of a certain age.
Simply Perfection
This group has always been fantastic and extremely talented. They sing better then most original singers. Live on Pentatonix, so proud you have continued strong and well.
❤❤❤
Kirstin's look is stunning ✨✨
El tema de Cher es de los 2000
hammer,
So good!!
You are the best ❤
In the 90s a LOT of the Eurodance was from Germany and the Netherlands...
Как же здорово, что на 00:46 Пентатоникс исполняют Руки Вверх
Avendo 40 anni le conosco tutte ❤❤mi avete fatto rivivere la mia giovinezza ❤❤❤.   Super bravi
Sem comentários!❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💯👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Cual sera el titulo de la cancion 2:15
I’m a straight male who’s listens to hip hop but i acknowledged talent and this was great the remake of nostalgic music back then
Why is this not on Spotify 😞
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
шапка долі
All of these songs are now used in the reels 😂
Starting all my workouts with this mix
0:53 Mitch sounds like a trumpeting Angel!  Would love to hear a full version if Better Off Alone!
Где песня Cher самый крутой отрезок, полный восторг 😍
Every time we touch is not 90s
Unbelievable
Plot twist : They're all wearing shorts beneath.
Hits Hits Hits hits ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
sonique - the best)))
FENOMENI...SONO STRA INNAMORATA DI VOI❤❤❤
Super Pentatonix, Thank you :-) !!!
This. Is. Epic!

HOW AM I FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS SOOO FLIPPING LATE!!!!!!
Yea, I gotta petition for more like this... full versions of everything. BOY BAND MUSIC LIKE NSYNC!
This is outstanding
PTX should do a whole medley of just Cher!!! a fucking LEGEND
I need full song boom boom boom vengaboys by pentatonix i need a full version
When you hear Mitch and think that its probably autotune but hearing them live makes it more amazing because it just sounds like the studio version
Gente... que TOP!!!!!! 🎉
Pretty sure Kirstin might just be the most beautiful woman on the planet.
2:41 WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ANYMORE.
Still here in 2024 waiting for it to be available on Apple Music.
And this is why they are the best.
Did they ever release a downloadable version of this? I don’t think they did….
So many good memories were reignited by this video :D
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not a long-term fan (discovered them recently) so I don't know their names but GOD DAMN! The voice of that guy with the mustache is totally unreal! Those highs he hit were higher than even Snoop Dog ever smoked himself to.
Very Good!!!!!🥰🥰
So many memory ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
that dude is spicy af lol y'all know who im talking about
i was born in '91, and i had a few CDs of dance music as a kid, many of these were my favourites, this is crazy nostalgic for me
thanks cher.. for ushering in nepo babies..and it's the worst kind of ironic because you're pretend homeless.
So much talent!
Good god that was incredible!!!!! I definitely want to hear full versions of all these. Unbelievably amazing!!!!
Yes please!!!
Increíble ❤❤🎉😊
eXcEllEnt!!! Great Songs with Great Voices!!!
More... more ... More ! Medley

Прекрасные голоса.
❤❤❤Thank  so much ❤
I would love to hear a 80s collaboration like this. Pretty please. 🤞♥️🫶👍
Super!👌👌👌🙏
I like how Matt is always smiling❤🔥🔥
Кто слушает в 2024 году
Пусть люди всей земли, возьмутся за руки, и песни запоют,   И миру мир,  и слезы только с радости.  А возле дома, птицы гнезда вьют.
Would love this more without the autotune/distortion, tbh.
this is my childhood!!
Need a Part 2!!
They are so amanzing , love  Yours job end voice  , noone it's better xD , all the Best xD 😁😍😍😍😄🤪
this is issane
Why I miss this kind of edit lmao
何か物足りない？
1:00 GURL PUT YO SHIRT BACK ON

Giuseppe ❤
Speak directly to my Millennial soul.
Powerful
I need the full version of 3:37  Kirstin's voice melts me every single time I get there 🥴
I like they Pentatonix, are so osome☺️😙😄
testing my new amp with this masterpiece! freaking awesome!
Sonique - Feels so good 😍 wow
Hearing these song makes me sad. Did you guys know you were living in a golden era? I certainly didn’t. I would do anything to be taken back to the 90s
жаль что вы в политику  увязались. зря. удачи.
you gues af a beautifulllllll voooooosssssseeee😀😄😄😁❕❕❗❗‼
This is so ironic because they were all born in the 90s....I think. I could be wrong, lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Non-stop breaking damn dance in
Muchas gracias por traerme tantos buenos recuerdos
Bravo 😂 yall took me back...the memories 😂😢 Cascada "Everytime we touch" Wasn't that 2000
Супер! Очень понравилось!
I just heard this on the radio 😭
Kevin was the MVP in this one! Wow!!!
Smashed it 💣💣💥💥💥 Nice 👌🏻
How I'm in love with Mitch, my dream is to one day see him in person, I don't even know what I would do, Mitch, you're passionate in this video. I love you crush
damn... i fall in love again with pentatonix
PLEASE!! Make the full version!!! 🤩🤩🤩
да вы творите чудеса! слушать очень приятно!)
천상계 화음이다 진짜. 사람이 저렇게도 소리낼 수 있다니 대단하네요. 잘 듣고 갑니다. 또 들으러올게요.
yesterday i hate it. Today Love it.
1:13 1:23 4:37
Ви не реально круті!) обжнюю Вас!)
I would love to see a complete re-making of all of these songs done by Pentatonix! A can of worms has been opened and it can't be re-sealed!
Mitch singing EVERYBODY DANCE NOW was ecerything for me😂❤ This video really was nostalgic
I love this so much, I want to do a cover of this medley! 😍😍😍😍 #90smusiclover
God I hate this group. There music is soulless and over produced. Sounds so bad
She sounds just Cascada.
Хочется продолжения, в те годы много хитов было, которые не вспомнили
where is gone the bassman? he is necessary
What song is 1:52
Flashback to childhood/teenage years…. I love it! ❤
Ребят, в самом деле. Достали уже эти попурри. Лучше бы вместо этого пару нормальных вещей сделали
I'm from Brazil. You voices is very very very beautiful. Really are voices of Angels. Congratulations.Amazing !!!! 😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
Wooooh! ❤❤❤😂 Love it!
Damn so good...
Top 10 greatest. instant classic
3202😉2023
I used to love Gunther, until I saw Mitch with a really similar style as his.... Now I can't listen to Gunther without picturing him, what a beauty <3
they was better before
When they sing i was like…IT NOT THE 80s!
Uhmazing! 😮❤
Really just want the full cover of most of these from them... been long enough now😜  An album just called "playing around" thats just them singing their favourite radio hits from each decade!
Soooo much talent 🔥
The transitions are incredible.
matt好可爱啊，他唱的时候感觉一直在笑，以及mitch真的这个胡子真的太搞笑了😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Kirsten really glowed down. I used to love her genuine love for the music they were making. I can’t stand her duck lips
Genuinely tried not singing or dancing as a challenge. It was so hard! Couldn't even make 30 seconds!
This is so gay...and I'm here for it!
I didnt know that they had Mbappe in their band.
1:15 kevin ate that part🔥💓♥️
POV: You walk into a dance club in the early 2000s.
perfect guys I Love You PTX😍🤩❤
I loved ❤❤❤❤
CONHEÇO TODASSS
Огонь!
I’m absolutely OBSESSED with Scott’s expressions at the beginning of I’m Blue 2:55
They all are putting out vibes, but Scott’s is….ooh! Steamyyyyyy. 😜
The ultimate 90's playlist ❤
Every time we touch by cascada was released in 2006
Yes need an album of thee songs
I think Scott looks like a banana in the yellow suit😊😊
REAL NICE.!!!!  THANK YOU !!!❤️❤️👍👍
Soooo good!!!!!
Why mbappe is singing here?
Класс )))
We need a 90s album
Did she get a new wig or something?.. she can't stop flashing it.
AMAZING 😁😁😁
Better than the originals!! How is that even possible ! Pentatonix you are the Phoenix's of Music !!!! Just Incredible !!!!
All but one of these songs sounds better than the original. It's amazing how Pentatonix probably spent half an hour rehearsing each one and hands down better than the originals. For those who are OCD it's " Everytime We Touch" was not better but still that's very impressive
I'm in my 60's I have heard a lot of music! But you guys are beautiful music indeed thank you.
Please make a 2000s, and 2010s 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Happy Thanksgiving Pentatonix
So easy to forget how many great dance beats we had in the 90s.  So well done.
Human voise -- beautiful instrument
умеете могете
Please make it in longer fuller version 😢
Is Kylian Mbappé a member of PENTATONIX?
Diooooooooos, en mi vida los voy a poder ver en algún concierto pero como disfruto de lo que hacen. Amo, amo y admiro su evolución ❤️❤️❤️
Ла Ла Ла Ла ... Сергей Жуков forever ❤
The bass, percussion and rhythm sounds are just unreal, along with all the melody and core are just fantastic.  Amazing job!
❤🍎🕊
As allways 90's on the top!
wonderful
uau
Some songs were from early 00 , but not from 90-th.
Thank you for humanity
I love all of these songs! I could listen to this melody all day!❤ However Everytime we touch by Cascada came out in 2006 not the 90’s.
Cher was honored more than anyone else! Yeah!
🎼 Boom boom fiss fiss   Give Me some Full Versions.. tick boom tick boom pss ba ba boom 🎼

Вааа аще......... Класс!!!!
Jesteście fantastyczni!!! Radość życia to min słuchać Was. Brawo!!!  Życzę Wam samych przyjaznych i pomocnych ludzi wokół Was ❤
ССССССССУУУУУУУУПППППППЕЕЕЕРРРРР
This followed/after L.E.J - Mashup 80s is my new playlist
Don't know his name but the beat box guy needs a proper solo part :)
Бессовестно позорят целый пласт музыки - шведский евро-денс стал символом эпохи и им остаётся))))
Damn, how sick😲👌
Well done  Only they could've pulled that off. They covered everything.
I grew up in the 70s, experienced the 80s but this mix of the 90s is just awesome
can you do like the Cher song the whole thing but in general all of them I need them for my phone Love you guys much.
I always forget Blue was a 90s hit.
5:02
❤🎉 shout out to pentatonix they are stars  and inspiring
STAAHP!!! You guys are AMAZING!!! Please never stop recording new material!! ❤❤❤
Audio sync feels like mandarin or cyrillyic
Amazing - leaves you wanting more and more
Do more wwe songs please - loved it.
Maravilhosos !!!

Sallee's smile is EVERYTHING ❤
I love the”Everybody Dance Now”
I love this video ❤❤❤❤❤❤💜💜💜💜💜💜

The beat boxers need to sing more great voices
Please tell the beautiful brunette ( lol I don’t know any of their names )  To not do the hair other than natural !! Please gf
а когда это Cascada стала хитом 90х?)
최고다 진짜
Whoever edited this video earned their paycheck
Мурашки по коже Вы охуенны
Wow...thanks for the nostalgic feeling.. songlists please
CORE MEMORIES UNLOCKED
EL CHICO DE SACO RAYADO TIENE UNA VOZ MUY DULCE
These angels can sing everything. I love them all.❤❤❤❤❤
Such talent!
5:00 Honestly i just wanted to now we're he got this Outfit it looks very Cool. 😊
The 90s were THE BEST era periodt
Bravo 👏👏👏
Please tell me someone’s made a playlist of these songs.
Why is this recording not on spotify?
Honestly I am only interested in everytime we touch, waiting for tonight, and believe
In so much as I'm attracted to people (I'm ace), I am attracted to women, and yet I am sure I would swoon for any one of these guys if they sang to me.
Over 2 years later I'm still mad that Everytime We Touch is included despite it being released in the mid 2000s
Where full versions?!? Ree
WHAT THE HECK  OMG I LOVE  BLUE
THATS SUS
AYO WHY THE HECK DID SHE JUST DO THAT
My gosh, this medley was the perfect way to start my weekend❤
Cocukluğumun şarkıları❤❤❤
They never gonna put this on Spotify 😅
I know most of these songs I already, but does anyone know the song names and artists?  I want to explore more their music from that genre snd decade.
I just saw them perform this live last night and I’m still shook
90? 50% 00
The fact this only has 20.5m views compared to their other videos, makes me think most of their fans are zoomers... ><
Once again Mitch shows he is a superstar.
Stop pushing Matt Sallee aside and let him sing solo more… love his voice.
Agreed and make it an album
Não aceito não ter corona na lista
Y’all should totally do Cher through the years
The everytime we touch transition to I’m blue is the best fkn thing ever
Please make a full everytime I touch video. 😢
awww come on where was DONT WANT NO DONT WANT NO DONT WANT NO SHORT... you know what, it was probably for the best.
Too much editing/auto tune on lead vocals, but decent vid
I swear, we need them to do full covers of all these songs. They're too good and I want to hear it all
what are the artists' names?
Oh gods…this takes me back to all my happy places! Seriously, thank you for making this and making me love music again.
This is mind-blowing. Gigi D'Agostino's L'amour toujours is missing, though.
This is the best thing I’ve ever heard 😮thank you
Autotuned to hell
I need better off alone with Pentatonix version, I'm in love with this one version ❤
Now and then completely amazed at mr Tenor's clean timbre. Whew.
This takes me back to the disco era, snorting substances in the balcony of the club, dancing dancing dancing, oral sex back in the balcony, dance dance dance, drink drink drink, another line, another girl, having the lights come up and seeing who could use a ride... oh hell man, those WERE the days that will never happen again. Or maybe the raves are that good.
Never heard this until now. Another song to love
MEGA❤
Even if I remember all these songs, has someone written down the titles?
❤❤❤❤❤
We try to do this with my friends and we end up laughing our asses off about how out of tune we get. lol
Ла- ла- ла, весь день я напиваю. Ла- ла- ла, весь день я повторяю.
I feel like Pentatonix hacked into my Gateway 2000 and stole my Winamp playlist...
I can picture my mom singing these in the car when I was  kid...thanks for the memory.   I can't remember a lot of her outside of being sick.
Always on fire ❤🎉
This is absolutely mind-blowing❤❤
awesome
so freaking good.
Shitttttt…this was sooooo damn good. And a blast to the good days
Thank you 🙏
потрясающе!!!
That blue monotone was a nice touch.
This is Amazing !
Why doesnt Kevin sing an<thing in this ?
Mine at 3:11 ❤love that song
When I was young, people had to put lipstick at their lips. If you slipped away and it came at your skin, you had to clean it. It was pretty precise. Now they do it like little children. Lipstick all around the mouth surface, almost underneath their chin and in their nose. Maybe they got lessons from a clini-clown.
I need new glasses, but I like it so much that I don't see the people when I walk without glasses. Now my world is not sharp anymore.
Eu te amo Pentatonix 🥰
What I would love is a live version
Release new music pls
Epic!!
I'm kinda disappointed the medley didn't include "Mr. Vain" by Culture Beat.
Fantástico, só quem viveu sabe a emoção de reviver essas músicas 😍
Saw this video for the first time back when I was a sophomore in high school in 2008. This was my favorite song all throughout high school, but started getting more into edm after I graduated in 2011. I still look back to my musical tastes from when I was younger, and I still come back to this amazing performance all these years later. Thank you for such a great performance and I hope you are still doing g well!!!
Cascada released every time we touch in 2005

90s music is sooooo infectious thats y they call it revoutionary era i ve nothing but huge respect for other eras but this is sooo special at the same time soooo goooood !!❤👌OOPS ITS GOOSEBUMPS TIME 😎👌
Autotune heyja
So fuking good!
Autotune is on max level!😂
I'm sorry for saying this. But the more i watch this the more i wonder. Why does it seem like the dressed Mitch Grassi looking like a late 80's porn director in the pinstripe suit?  Then dress em looking like an 80's porn star in the other? Am i the only one wondering this?
Hindi mo kami maloloko Adam Conover! 😂
Fantabulous ❤
You had me la dada di dada dada
Pentatonix Cover of Pentatonix's Cover of Pentatonix's cover of Pentatonix's Cover of Pentatonix's Cover of...5Tonix!

なつい！ zip FM聞いてたの思い出すヨォ
You are the best ❤
Как всегда- красавчики👏👏👏👍
This version isn’t on Spotify.😢
1:35 - 1:42 V-fade
Sad they didn't include "Barbie Girl" (unless I missed it).
Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Greetings from Hungary!
2:40 Cinta Satu Malam.. oh indahnya
Почему использовали кавер ATC 0:38? Оригинал "Руки в верх - Песенка", так и пойте по-русски!  ( Google Translate - Why did you use the ATC 0:38 cover? The original "Hands up - Song", and sing in Russian!)
Nostalgia alert, y'all! 90's kids forever baby! 👍
So I'm seeing Scott looking like James Corden and I've always thought that Mitch  has a Freddy Mercury-esque jawline/position of mouth when he's blasting those crazy, how the hell can you reach those notes, didn't know they existed notes. Just my opinion 🤗💚
I was a teenager through the 90s. I’d forgotten how many lyrics were nonsense words. Ah, nostalgia.
@pentatonix can you cover 90's boy band too
@pentatonix can you cover 90's boy band too
Hhvhhg🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 1:07 1:08 1:08 1:08
WHY ISNT THIS ON APP,E MUSIC OR SPOTIFY THATS ILLEGAL
OMG it's Mbappe doing BeatBox!!
I listen to this all the time in the car....
Yoooooo these guys
This video was amazing I can't get tired of listening to it. Please make a video with each of these songs .✌🏻
Não me canso de ouvir.
I love the 90s
Pentatonix, do all of you have perfect pitch?  Those blind key changes between the songs is absolutely unbelievable!!  Fantastic work!! 👍🏼
I have to say this......she is absolutely one of the most drop dead gorgeous women in music.....definitely the most pleasing woman to catch my eye in a long time
vous êtes vraiment excellent mais " pentatonix"...... chinois est bien meilleur que vous
Autotune
PTX unbelievable
how old is scott
super mix Thank you
Listen to this musical jewel on june 2023
Excellent 👌!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sooo much fun!!!
What?! No Groove Is In The Heart?!
❤❤❤❤❤
O my god
Everytime we touch by cascada damnnn that bring my memories back hope can listen full cover from you guys
What's even cooler is how much fun they are having this whole time. I became a fan because of my mom and my wife. And I must say I am definitely a fan now.
This group is so good they could take a dirty word and make it Beautiful I’m so proud to be a Pentaholic!
Where can I download this medley? Is it on Apple Music as I can’t find it?
How the heck is this 2yo already
Those curls! Sexy does not even cover it! just amazing, absolutely amazing!
Was going to say you forgot the Riddle and then i relised it was even before the 90's but yah hit the nail on the head with few for the best songs from the day, brings back so many Mems
존나 쩌네!!!
I would have this vinyl!
MI NAME IS ISABELLA AND LOVE PENTATONIX🤩😍
Sky , sono chimba
Why did you pit a 2000s songs in a 90s mix such a let down 😅
EXCELLENT! ❤
The guy who has dark hair. To me is only that has talent! Not trying to be rude. But the guy can do his owe thing and definitely can succeed. I am saying this respectfully! This not to be rude to the other members of this group. This my view! Don’t want to hear from their fans ok! If the group reaches through here is just my opinion band wish you all the best .
I heard it live in Zürich trust me it’s 100 better than here. What a show that was ❤
God fucking damn the nostalgia
Saw them in Budapest ❤
Love this!!! Absolutely amazing!!! I want you All to do “Take me to Church” please! I know it would be absolutely beautifully Amazing!!! Soul Smashing!!!
How did I only just find you guys...love this so much
Some of the suits give me 70s vibes though :’D
We can't deny our age watching this 😅
It's criminal that you cannot puchase this or even stream it on music platforms.
Best of the best❤🎉  love❤
this version of finally hits different, I love it so much!
These beautiful voices were picked for each of these oh so talented and wonderful young souls. they bring tears to my eyes and a mellow calm to my soul so sweet. I have watched many of their videos only to be "touched" beyond compare. Thy Father certainly knew just who he created these awesome human beings to be. I love each and every one of them individually. Simply because they are separate individuals that have come together in "Sweet Harmony". They are Blessed - I can see & "feel" it!  DD🕊
This needs to be played at the club.💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾🕺🏾💃🏾
I love the re edit
Wow so follow these harmonious amazing singer's love 💕
Isso é bom demais, affs!
Amazing video and medley but why does your stylist believe the 90s were GTA V?
Yeah great, but multitracked vocals are kind of cheating for a barbershop band....
Wowww ! ❤
Ma io li amooo😍😍😍❤
Oh. my. God. You literally recreated a mix tape my friends and I listened to on the way to our first unsupervised camping trip on junior year of high school. Every single song you performed as on this mixtape. Wow. Brought back great memories. Thanks for that!!! What an incredible performance.
Absolutely mindblowing..... awesome
Every now and then I just remember “Pentatonix” and my life is substantially improved. Love love love these people❤
Mitch was MADE for 90s bops
You guys were JUST unmasked. You guys were AMAZING!  Well done.
I think the blonde is really sexy
My name is Sally hogdon
By eck! Pure awesomeness 😮❤❤❤❤
This hurts but in the good way
Wtaf?!!! Why have never heard of them?? Well, the name does sound vaguely familiar.  Surely there's autotune involved here? Probably not, but even if, still magical regardless!
This is amazing!
chrissy aging like fine wine
Scott, Mitch and Kirsti you killin' this! As for Kevin and Matt you the best! So good together❤
Stunning, astonishing, breathless
I can Smell the dry ice!!!   Mmmmm Dance floor memories
That brings me  back  to  my childhood  lol
WOW
She has an amazing voice
😘😘😝😁😍
😎😎😝
Took 10 years after The Sing-Off, but they finally got that Believe arrangement down!
Incrível ❤❤❤❤
Wow ❤❤❤
Yhis is a hello you're. Thanks youre.
Hello.Pentatonix this is a a home.
Amazing, i can say this is real singers❤
I just found and listened to this group last night 1st time. The Prayer I listened over and over...>>> This one has blown me away as much if not more. Incredible
Petition for PTX to make more evolution videos, like music in the movies or Lady Gaga or an 80s medley
Y'all always look like you are having a blast!! Can't wait for you guys to win on Masked Singer!! Sorry your voices are undeniably yours and nobody can match your harmonies
Adoro de mais esse grupo ❤❤❤
Actually this versions are better than original for some reason :D
I hate this so much 😡👎🏼

Their tones and belt are insane and I can believe their all in tune with each other
U know what, this vid has the best Scott's hairstyle, the one when he wears brown shirt
I grew up with these songs...Pentatonix made me nostalgic💙
NAAAAIIIIIIIIIISSSSUUUUUUUU!!!!  Also sad that Ace of Base only got like fricken 3 secs...
fell in love with her voice ohh
Umm.. there was a 2000's song in there lol

Cascada is definitely not 90s😮
My Childhood in under 6 minutes <3
It's feels  good watching while reading comments 😊

Your covers are much better than the originals. You have left me speechless!
Молодчинка, Віра! Дякую ❤ Ти чудова у такому образі.   Твоя позиція і твоя підтримка зараз надважлива для нас
I listen to this when..I’m blue (I would bleed, I would die)

I would like to have all of these songs made by Pentatonix individually.
Cascada in 90's ? 🤪
2:41
С таким удовольствием послушала! 😍 Спасибо! 🌹
You guys never cease to amaze me!  Some of the best beat boxers in the world and each of you with such amazing lead vocal voices too.  You guys are fantastic!  Thank you for sharing your gifts with the world!
I wish you sung all of these songs in Full, so many of them were favourites of mine growing up, many of which I've not heard since my early teens. Great stuff.
they are great🎉
wow
Красавцы 👏
You can't have a 90s medley without singing the iconic Pokemon theme song! 😭😭😭
Yep
Ahhhhhhhh we finally got to hear their guilty pleasure song before they switched to VKTRS(iconic)
Wow... Dancing all the way... 🤩😎😍
Princes step brother did a good job. And she is the best white Asian Tony braxton
何度聴いても、最高！ 全てが素晴らしい！ 私を救ってくれた。 命を守ってくれた。 ありがとう、Pentatonix！ これからもずっと、ずっと、素晴らしい音楽を！

Oh no. She got the lips... she looked great before :/
I liked. greetings from Brazil
Hi I know this is a lot to post on here but I want to thank you all and the entire team behind this group because it's really helped me as of late with understanding how much music and musicality mean to me personally to handle my autistic tendencies. Your music has really inspired me to feel more creative and trust myself and my voice more and artists like you and especially in a genre like this where level of musical understanding is through the roof, it really gives me trust that what i love is something worth putting myself into. Also sorry for long post, only way I know how to comment XD
what is that strange thing with a moustache
Ооо эти голоса 😲💗💗💗💗просто бомбачка... Они такие няшные
After ALL the bull of the day is in your face and it doesn't smell like the 90's
Love this but I am a bit distracted by...what did she do to her lips? She looks like a totally different person.
All these songs hit me in the feels, but I can't believe that none of these guys was old enough to even know these songs.
A beep off.
Anyone else suddenly wanna go to roller kingdom? Or insert local roller rink here
2:15 Old Days 💔🥺
hi pentatonix,i'd líder know the name of the música you played in this vídeo?🥰🥰
I would love to se PTX do covers of all the songs.
i wish you would make an album with all the full versions of the songs from this medley. that would be the best thing ever <3 <3
)))) Прям в своё детство окунулся с этими песнями. Даже не могу описать это теплое чувство. Браво, браво, браво!!!
These are my favorites 😍!! The nostalgia is hittin like dopamine!
This song is on Spotify 😣🥺

Thank God I’m a 90s kid 😁
Best 90s medley I’ve ever heard
This is FIRE!
Ptx almost sang believe by cher on the sing off, they finally got it out here...
I’m sad I didn’t get Barbie Girl
Such a talented group. Would love to see them team up with Home Free. Can you imagine what that would result in?
mitch was so handsome on this clip, i wanna marry him
those guys are really talented to bring good old times back
!!!!!!!!
ATM listening with my Beats Solo 3, so perffffff!!! 😍🤩🔥🔥🔥

GOOOSEBUMPS!! So fantastic
I'm incredibly impressed as always
SO GOOOOOOS

they use a vocoder and a harmonic synthe. What a déception
Thank you so much. You remembered me my teneeger and twenty years. ❤️❤️
이건 진짜 일주일에 7번씩 들어줘야 한다..
This is amazing!
The biggest wish i have is when we die qe can go back and live the moments we love
its beautiful
This made these songs sound much  better. So many good songs, now everything sounds the same.
Pleeeeease, STYX 's "pieces of eight" from the everlasting album pieces of eight.  Don't you know classics ?!?  Been a fan since you've been discovered by the elderly i'm been since there's been no such things than "a capella" since 70's ro ll'over behttoven's...  Com'on folks you're gifted whith voice and magic, like you've been spoiled with endless breathing... Thank for makin' my  Ol'days whorth livin'...🤗🙏🙏🙏
I love this! It would be awesome to see a 70s medley! With maybe Rasputin, dancing queen, I will survive. All of those fun 70s hits!
Amazing!
Woooooow! Its awesome, Mbappe left soccer and now sings in this group!!
petition for full album of songs <3
all those songs have a greater meaning for me. not one of those songs dont hold a story for me, this was a nice flash back through my life. thanks for that one, cause i got a photogenic memory so i just had a whole movie going in my head
I didn't realize James Corden was a member of this group 😂
太好听了，都是少年时代的歌，我可以听一整天！！！

to po polsku
Ja tam byłem
This is the compliation i needed.   It brings back so many memories of the 90s.. the music i grew up with.   Of course Pentatonix sings it flawlessly as always.  Your voices are amazing!
I’m gonna need y’all to make a full-length version of Cher’s “Believe”.
Mbappe
The high pitched guy looks like a supervillain now
Why did they replace the long haired guy
The best!

Espectacular
Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats n Boots n Cats
I’ve been following this group since they first came on the scene. I’m probably one of the few unpopular opinions that don’t like them anymore. I loved how raw their videos used to be. Now that they have all this money they’re editing their stuff now. I miss the rawness. I miss the originality and the filmed at home vibe they had. And I’m sorry but does she have lip fillers now ??? Wth 😢
Спасибо вам ребята вы меня вернули в детство ❤️❤️❤️
Yea
Commenting again... the last few sings hit so hard. Keep doing you Pentatonix!!
wtf I watched?
I could look at Mitch for the rest of my life🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
joer... me la repeti tres veces seguidas, que bien hecho este video edit -> y me acabo de dar cuenta que el mes pasado tambien y puse comentario lol
GIVE US A FULL ALBUM WITH THOSE FULL TRACKS...NOW🥺😍😍😍🔥
How much times did you listen it? Yes...
The Pentatonix are amazing
Это просто супер. Браво!
almost 2 years of this masterpiece and nothing about full versions of all these songs 😭
I really hope @Pentatonix reads this. Y'all really need to follow this up with an 80's Freestyle Medley. I'm talking Stevie B, Freestyle (Don't Stop the Rock), Expose, Sweet Sensation, Cover Girls, Safire, LIsa Lisa and Cult Jam, Shannon, Johhny O, Cynthia, Will to Power, Debbie Deb.... I could go on for days...
1:53
I absolutely love this. Love it. Incredible. Just wish it was longer.
I literally need this as a whole album.
wow, sound great. Im a fan
Yea I use go dancing in the club i would buy that cd
To hear that i remember my childhood🥺❤️
What a funky chord at 4:48!
Wait, where is the other guy?😤🤨
Is it still Acapella with all the auto tune? Miss the old videos, you're all such great  singers auto tune is a huge disservice.
Por Dios, qué pasada la de It feels so good. Hacedla entera por favor!!!
Can we get a Bond Theme mashup?  After all, Nobody Does It Better.
Love it i  love everybody dance 😘😍
Thanks for taking me back to my teen years.    These songs bring back so many memories
Cari Pentatonix grazie per questo tuffo nella nostalgia! Fantastici!🥰🇮🇹
PENTATONIX FOR THE WINNN!!! 🥰
Waaaaa🥰🥰🥰
How is this is a cappella anymore? Everything in this is done or been modified by computers. Just sad that something so great came to this :(
You are brilinat for me ... and beautifle 👍😍
Loved all the songs they used
Bravi!!!
Finally, an arrangement of Believe, since they nixed it during The Sing Off (albeit their replacement was their breakthrough…)
their attitude thooo 😍😍😍😍
Coool 8-D
DUDE I love when Mitch nails those screech notes!
J Lo could never.
Замечательно!!!!
Вас много , нужно больше сингла давишки ... будет более входяши
We need better off alone in just one video I LOVE IT
How about an 80s dance medley???
Now it's pure medley.....
AWESOME  !!!!
Doc martens, z cavariccis, mossimo, and the honda prelude with flip up lights going head to head with the toyota supra......good times
I already stop counting how many times per day I play this. My energizer during workday together with Daft Punk. Never get old, never will!
Would I rather be lonely or surrounded by these people that don't even deserve any terms
It is hiawatha or hiawatha who stole ny life aka Leslie not me
They always amaze me. How many songs did they cycle through before settling on these? I would have loved to hear what they discarded.
The jump into "Gypsy Woman" gave me goosebumps.
I did not notice the Dance in the title: I was expecting 90's R&B and pop songs and was wondering why all the songs were dance songs. 🙈🙈🙈
Ils sont EXCELLENTES ! Des voix magnifiques ! Agréable à entendre ! Je ne m'en lasse pas !
Okay seriously, I need Scott to record the entirety of What Is Love. 🤩
So damn good.
Video starts at 2:55.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Amazing as always my fave Pentatonix ❤
Чудесные голоса, классные ребята, давно их слушаю, всегда радуют своими композициями
Pls do a full collab w Cher!
Ive probably listened to it more than 5 times back to back … its soooo good!!!!! Spotify it ASAP! ❤
You guys are fricking AMAZING!  Loss of words.  Congratulations on your success!
Everybody dance now ❤️
You guys are geniuses! I love all your creations!
Neice
This is just showing up on my recommendations NOW? A year later? What kind of twisted algorithm  is this?  Omg, this Mashup gives me life! I used to dance to  ALL of these during the 90s. So glad Pentatonix did these songs justice! 🎵
INCREDIBLY TALENTEDzzzzz
the greatest hits of the 90s are history just the best
YOU ARE AMAZING 😍
i just had the best 5 min 43 secs of my life
2.50 song name pls
Ok but now I need the full version of every song..
0
I can't get enough of this amazing group.
Buongiorno a good 9 0 for 02 to get 09909000000
Holy cow. I just revisited high school graduation, going to college, turning 21, my first job, my first apartment of my own, and a whole host of other things. And now I’m old again. I can’t thank you enough for that!
БЕСПОДОБНО!!!!! BRAVISSIMO!!!!
do they have 3 or 2 of the original group here?
I love this
Se escuchaba más genial con el otro chico.
Not My favourite type of music. I prefer pop to dance, loved the 'I'm blue'. I'd love to hear Michael Jackson, Billy Joel & Madonna Full Covers and the full  Priscilla Queen Of The Desert Soundtrack.
I would love to hear them do Christmas canon .they will kill it..I feel silly saying someone would kill a Christmas song..lol..but they'd def be in their element with that one.
..sooooo cute ❤️ ❤️❤️...luv it😘😘
❤❤❤❤❤ Amazing
SO FUNNY IS ISABELLA PURNAMASRI PHILLIPS KARTINI ANNY SARAWATI PHILLIPS
This entire song feels like a guilty pleasure 😳
Need the album
HELL YEAH!!! Haha! Awesome!
Sounds pre recorded and they lip syncing in this video.. and major voice editing on it too.
CASCADAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!! \o/
Show me LOVE!!!😍
jooooer <3 <3 <3
Would love to see them do a 2010’s remix with David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Avicii, Martin Garrix and others!!
omg thanks for this ! So good !
где басист делся？ лайк, конечно, но интересно
All great songs, but my 2 favorites are Believe & Blue
I cant believe they can do this with there vocals, amazeballs.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Please make full versions of Everytime we touch & Da Ba Di!!!! Epic
What I listened to: 0:05 Unknown - Darararirararara 0:20 Corona - What Is Love 0:37 Naughty Boy - La La La 0:52 David Guetta feat Ne-Yo & Akon - Play Hard 1:13 Unknown - Everybody Dance Now 1:23 Bastille - Of the Night 1:39 Unknown - Generic 90s song 1:53 Unknown - More generic 90s song 2:14 Cascada - Everytime We Touch (Vocaloid version + Romantic relationship anime video) 2:56 David Guetta & Bebe Rexha - I'm good (Blue) 3:11 Unknown - Even more generic 90s songs 5:27 Unknown - Darararirararara
Old but gold shessshhhh😮
Is it just me was dance mix better in the 90’s.  Could also just be bias on my part.
After all these years, they've still got it.
2:15 2:56 3:54 😍😍😍
Yo  i could picture an anime in my head just change from different peoples perspective on the dance floor
Well, that's truly amazing.  Run this at the club and folks will thrash for hours on the floor.
Thank you for being back my child hood music born in 1990
Stellar sounds but Scott failed the assignment without having the center part, forming the hair-curtains of the infamous Joshua do. 😂 ❤️🧡💛💚💙
I miss Avi in this
4:44 I LOVE THIS SONG
Don't forget everyone, these are Texan's. These are ours.
MITCH IS ANGELIC. PERIOD.
Amazing!!!!!!!! Love you guys
THEY DID NOT NEED TO GO THIS HARD....AND THEY WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND ONCE AGAIN!!
Imma keep it buck50… this video gave me PTSD. I worked at Malibu Jack’s for 4 years… and this was pretty much the exact playlist. EVERYDAY. FOR 4 YEARS!!! But atleast these versions are all way better. 😂😂😂
I’m going to see you guys live this year in December and I can’t freakin wait!!! My first PTX experience and I’ve never been so happy!! Thank you guys so much for this!
4:03 Increible!!
This is one of the best things I've ever heard.
I'm Russian, maybe I'll write incorrectly, but your creativity touches the soul so much.Very amazing creativity I admire you so much that I can't seem to live without your voices, they seem to have restored part of what I've been looking for for a long time... thank you!!!😍😍😍😍😍
I didn't want it to end! What an amazing tribute!!!
Absolutely incredible as always! ❤️👍🏻
I love how even the background (red light with a part that’s black) is SO 90’s.  That was THE photo studio background back then. I literally have a student photo with that background 😂
Newst
Damn those high notes from Mitch 😱 this is the greatest thing ever. An 80’s one would be awesome!
Saludos desde Cuba
Классно! Я все вспомнил! Спасибо!
EL CHICO DE BIGOTE TIENE UNA VOZ MUY DULCE
This reminds of infomercials for 90s hit mixes on tv back then. 😃
This bring back to my 20’s going dance I g in club
AMAZING!
👑💎💃🔊🎧🕺💗
I am always astonished on how much "sound" two people can produce by beat boxing. I raise my hat to you good sirs!
This group is so wonderful.  I never get tired of listening to them!
these guys are amazing. im just wondering if one of then did not hit puberty :p jk
Nice！！crazy🤪
Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..
Dope👏🏼
Absolutely nailed it❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
It would be wonderful a longer version of any song in the mix.
Hubiera sido espectacular una versión más larga de cada canción
MY TEENS! I know all these by heart. Time goes too fast.
Who misses the 90s for that music to end they reminded us of it thanks pentatonix
J’adore, Pentatonix!!! Excellent !
simply amazing
Holly !sht where did these guys come from. How can u be perfect with all the songs!
You are in autotune that bets your acapela theme/goal #PENTAUTOTONIX
I wanna go to the gym, don't know why 😅
I miss your dubstep club remixes flourishes you used to put in all your songs when it added to it.
It always makes me a little sad that nobody know that Around the world is originally Russian song called "Песенка" by band Руки вверх
I love the edits the videos, go 90s music !!!! never old
There’s a dude missing 😢
❤
Excelente. Se extrañaba a este grupo vocal . Patrimonio cultural de la humanidad
Praise God. Fear not, fight not, cry no more, for God will fight for you in this time, in every situation. Trust in God. He that gave you joy, and hope to live, He is about to give you another Amazing Testimony in your life. Stay Prayerful, and He'll get you through all you are facing
If you're wondering if they can perform this live, the answer is yes. It's always yes https://youtu.be/U10A4ijmEH4
нырнул в прошлое... супер!!!
Now these... These were HITS! I miss this great sound...
I wish they would do an 80s collection.
❤❤❤❤❤ I listen to late 80's and 90's music better than half the crap on todays radio..
I love the one that is like boom boom boom boom i want u on my room
el del bigote facil pudo haber hecho la película de freddy mercury
Man we had some good songs growing up
BASS AND DRUMS!!!!!
WOW!!!!!!!!
O gay tem voz de mulher mano
I used to watch pentatonix when they started and honestly didn’t think they’ll last this long,amazing. Although, I’m curious about what happened to the guy with the long hair.
FABULOUS!
Mitch's range....is...UNREAL!! All 5 of them are fantastic. His vocal range on this one just hit me hard.
90s music is the best
You guys are so rad! Thank u for bringing us so much joy and back to the days of peace n great music
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT A SHAME THIS ONE DOESN'T GET AS MUCH VIEW AS THE HITS LIKE "DAFT PUNK" or OTHERS BEST OF PENTATONIX......THE MEDLEY IS REALLY EXCELLENT...WE ARE BACK TO THE BASICS THAT MADE PENTATONIX ON TOP OF THE SCENE OF ACAPELLA AND WE GIVE THE BEST TRIBUTE TO THESE 90'S SONG THAT ARE DIAMONDS ..WELL DONE PENTATONIX
YAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS
man i want to see these guys do a full video on It Feels So Good - Sonique. so good!
lipsinking is not wat it was sound and vidio is very difrend  but great songs epic
Me, confused: wasn't Every Time We Touch released in 2006
The best music and the way they do music, it was 🔥 loved it, a longer melody, I would have no problem 👍
Superb 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spettacular ❤👏
Kirstie's lips make her look like a duck billed platypus.   She's totally ruined her look.
This compilation made me forget they didn't actually have find playing. Crazy!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a wonderful and talented band!  How amazingly you play with  voices.  You sing so harmoniously and beautifully. I admire you! I wish you health and happiness.
I’m still waiting for the 00’s and 10’s , I think they should do this for every decade but I understand why the 90’s works well for their sound; I wanna hear Mitch do some Hinder lol
super plus  pour le vintage- remix !!!! et merci pour les souvenirs !
your so me so happy now love you were love you tooooooooooooooooooo
My ignorant a** didn't even know Americans knew most of these😑
I looove this song 🤩🤩🤩💙💙💙    🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
when ptx starting using autotune
Kirstin’s curls deserve an award
Man I hate how people get confused, they somehow think a 90s song is early 2000. FYI 90s music ended very early 2001, the music from 2001-08 sounds completely different!   If you're from America, it's probably a different story, their  music charts are so limited in diversity. Imo
Why is this not an album yet?!
Did they replace someone?
Dope
I'd love to get a copy of the raw video of Kristin in that silver top.  WOW
Danced by myself in the kitchen to this about 30 times....so far. No shame. This is great. Like damn near 40 and geeking over this.
Q vozes q bençãos, q Deus abençoe sempre vcs 😘
I implore you: please do the music Blue IN FULL please please please PLEASEEEEEE !!!!!!!!!
Wow. Every single one of these took my brain to a very specific place growing up.
Давно слежу за творчеством группы. Скажу только одно -- лучше них никто не споёт! Совершенствуются с годами, жаль, что из первоначального состава потеряли одного замечательного певца. Добра им и творческих успехов!
Kirstie looking beautiful as always she has a voice of a angel
Just one word....Phenomenal :)
Gratz on using some of the most unpopular songs ever to grace the 90's
They are absolutely amazing!! I think people who like this kind of '90 songs are probably "boomer", just like me..!! 👍🤣🤣
It sounds like they added electric sounds.

COME TO POLAND, P L E A S E
And WHERE IS BRITNEY QUEEN??? :O <3 (And the Cascada is not 90s...) :D
Yep this title is correct.
The vengaboys was my jam as a kid 😂
Magnifici! Uno più  bravo dell'altro 😉
These 90s songs were 00s songs in the UK. We apparently like songs from 10 years back.
Dat lip doe!
Oh my gosh this brought me back!
0:29 awww love this part 😭
This is so good!! I loved the entire video, but Believe was my favorite. Amazing work ♡
😍💖💖💖💖
Wish they did the whole song
what it's over already???? noooooooo
Believe is my favorite. but you make all the songs special for me...
I BLEW UP when I heard the beat for Feel So Good start! Omfg this is amazing!
SI RECUERDAS TODAS ESTAS CANCIONES ES PORQUE YA ESTAS VIEJO
Amazing voices and incredible editing! What more could you want?
Einfach cool.🎶🎶👍
Goosebumps.  Awesome.
I really wish I could just go back to being a kid in the 90s and stay there always
2:57 kinda addicted to this part😭❤️
Wow, I really enjoyed it. Great job👌👏
Какая музыка была классная..❤❤❤❤ Спасибо Пентатоникс..Вы лучшие
: )
I need a full rendition of Sonique alive in my life right now! That part was delicious!
Amazing!!!!!   Need to do full songs 70,80,90s definitely
I didn't have a happy childhood, but these songs make me wistful anyway.
Ayes 2006 such a 90s year am I right
BRAVO!
This band are AMAZING. Very talented group. And what I love is that they look like such a nice multi cultural mix of people
WOW!!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS..........
Aaaaaa
Best nostalgia kick that I didn't know I needed lol
I want to hear this live in DA CLUB!!!

I wanna hear an r&b house one. Some Lisa Stansfield, Soul II Soul!

слёзы взрослому мужику вышибает
They should do the full versions of all these songs I'd love to see what they make of them they are amazing
SUPER Top D+👍🎹🎶😉
Im obsessed!  Please do a full version of each individual songs or even a album. It's soooo nostalgic!
it's soooo goooooodddddd
Kirstin --  yes! Rocked it. It would be great to have full versions of all songs. Such an unexpected treat to see them show up in Jon Batiste's Sweet, too.
When I heard 'Round the World I just returned to my childhood when I used to listen trance all the time... I am not THAT old, but it came back in about 20010 for a while but then faded away once again.
He's a realy good beat boxer!
Vampire dude has a insane voice wow.
ME ENCANTA SU CANCION CANTAN MUY BIEN
One of the greatest things I've ever, ever heard
I would love to see PTX do covers of the songs
ALL..OF..YOU ARE..AMAZING! 👌
Autotune hit hard in Cher believe

Muy buenos felicitaciones !!!!
How is this possible?❤️👍🔥❤️‍🔥
You had me at Vengaboys
You guys are so good it just sounds like a mix of the actual songs. Can you not edit/mix the videos so we can see the process? It helps to know you are human and not just supreme beings? Thanks!
love it song
I hate every song. But I love Pentatonix.
Fantabulous
Sonique-It feels so good really touch my soul I need a full version 😍 these guys are Incredible 😍😍😍
I hate a cappella groups, show choirs, etc. But I can't help but love Pentatonix. They are freakishly good and entertaining.
my toxic trait is that i think i can sing like this lmao
Such beautiful and unique voices.
I swear I just relived my entire high school and early 20s again. Thanks PTX!
Well this made me feel old.
Amazing !!! ❤️ Good job guys !
Complete list of the song please
Love you so much guys !!
Amazing as always ❤️
Super musique bravo
I had no idea that “Everytime We Touch” was originally a 90’s song. Interesting.
Not the same without Avi.
KIRSTEN MALDONADO IS THE SEXIEST WOMAN EVER
1:54 is best
This is absolutely awesome! We need one from the 80's! And Finally, Mitch you look awesome! So happy to see you out of clothes that make you look like a 7 year old boy in your daddy's suit coat!!!
Amazing! How have I never seen or heard this???!
Fantastic nostalgia!
Damn,that's GOOD!! Wow.
definitely the best version of most of them. Thanks for dressing the part! exceptional
anybody else just immediately think of Night at the Roxberry?🥰
Cómo se llama la cancion del minuto 2? Alguien sabe?
Super top 100%
Love that they covered Believe by Cher! I’ve followed them since the SingOff and this was the song they wanted to do for the Guilty Pleasure round but didn’t have the skill to arrange it like they wanted at that time. It all comes full circle and it was beautiful as was this entire performance:)
I would LOVE to hear Pentatonix cover "Take It To The Limit" by The Eagles... The 1978 version with Mitch singing lead especially the high notes at the very end just like Randy Meissner!
This took me back to my childhood. Well done!
Suddenly I'm brought back to using the family computer after school in Middle school and discovering Euro Tech...good memories.
It's 2022, and 10 years after Moves Like Jagger I'm still loving you <3 #loveatfirstsound
I need a full version of it feels so good!!
I cannot believe I’m just seeing this!!! What a vibe! Especially that house music is making a huge comeback in mainstream pop!! Pentatonix just never misses! Everything they do is straight 🔥. This is why they have that Star in the a Hollywood walk of fame!!!
PLEASE! PLEASE! PRETTY PLEASE?!
I hate myself for sleeping on this group all these years. I must have heard of Pentatonix 10 years ago now or more and for some reason I think I always confused them with Paramore lmao like.. I think I just now discovered my new favorite group. And they've been around for ages lmao well at least I got a LOT of material to catch up on. This should be fun. 😊
Great now that blue song will be stuck in my head all day 😂
This reminds me of going to the skating rink every Friday when I was 12. This was all the songs they played lol God I miss being young 😭
0:40 omg y'all should do a 50s medley, or even specifically a Chordettes tribute medley.. like tell me these guys wouldn't do Sandman and Lollipop fcking perfectly???!!
Omg I am obsessed with Kirsten's hair in this video omfg she looks gorgeous 😍
Grande Mpappé haciendo beatbox!
I am speechless,  amazing talented singers.. Heavenly sounds .. I can hear it day by day without being bored of it ❤❤❤❤
I would press „👍🏼“ a thousand times if I only could!
Not me revisiting this channel after 6 years We went from carol of the bells to AAAAAAAAAAAH😍 I missed you guys 🥲
God, what planet are you from? I'm moving there. You must be from somewhere else because this is from another world. 👋👋🪐😀😀
Amazing 😍
wow this is insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMX61330m4
Do you think you're better off alone?
Classics done justice!! Amazing and heavenly sounding as always 💓
Driving across Canada listening to Pentatonix 👍👌
СТАло много эффектов, и мало души . На одном кадре было круто.  Круто конечно, но что то потеряли...
Килиан Мбаппе с PSG  ушел к вам ?:)
A 2000s versions as well? Even thought the 90s are so perfect! I just need moreeeeeeee
MUITO FODAAAAAAA♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Only one word... Simply the best!!
Petition for Pentatonix to sing and upload as they use to do like the old days 😣
Should do each of these individually would sell like crazy!!!
how does pentatonix always makes songs sound better than the originals
My god. Y'all are SO good. This is grand. I lost it at 2:56 at "I'm blue" - epic.
Unbelievably good, amazing♥.♥
We need a full version of im blue 😃
Love the energy they all get when they do Blue. It's like how they would all react if it came on in the club in the 90s
My HAPPY BIRTHDAY is on 9 APRIL!!!!!!!!
04:16 how???
Never is it necessary to show your armpits when you're  singing.
WHAT IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!! THIS IS STILL ACAPELLA???? LIKE WOW !!!!!
That's fantastic!!!
Wooooooooooooou😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😋😋😋😋😋
MITCH!..... 🕳️🖤
❤️〰️❤️
🥺😭❤️🤗
i am just blow away this group is just amazing
Woah 🤯😍😱🥰
Вообще, чтобы стать лучшими ВАМ не хватает азиата , индуса и оно. Чтоб всем угодить.
Waw you are amazing guy!!!
amg
When the teacher is afk in a zoom class be like:
15
BLUE MEN? Oh, please do the full song. I love those blue men.
what the hell happened to Kristie?
I couldn't like this more
They are so good
COULD YOU GUYS PLEASE DO “LAY ALL YOUR LOVE ON ME” 🥺🥺🥺
As always absolutely stunning. But be honest: how could you sing "Believe" without electronically modulating your voice? At least that's what it sounds like to me.
🤯🤯🤯 so cool💃💃💃💃 saturday night💃🤤
O tempo bom para os ouvidos.
Nostalgia! #80sKid

when u realize that some of the songs included in this medley became trending on tiktok
2:16
Much props to these guys! But also super props to the mixer for making it sound so leveled! Sounds amazing
according to wikipedia Around the world came out on May 22 2000 🤫
This hits me right in the 90s feels
I just LOVE this!!
GOD WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END, I just worked a graveyard shift and this gave me life like no energy drink could!
They look as good as they sound!
I’d love to have this on iTunes!
This video made my day!
Used to listen to these guys a LOT ....  They did their original band mate dirty and the new music is sadly edited ... still enjoy the classics
Even tho he looks good no matter what, but when Kevin had that black outfit on and he was in the bottom right corner, I was like damn he fine
I agree with the comments...please please , we need full versions...this is appetizers and we are not fully satisfied 😂
This is amazing
Ребята-вы молодцы.Музыка нас связала.Я вас люблю.

Dang I love the 90s. I think their music was better than the 80s.
I just say THANK YOU!  Turning my friends on to your music.........
***AMAZING***
Sad that they didn’t include Madonna’s Vogue, the ultimate club dance track
Beautiful!!!!...live!!!! Now!!!!
Such a wonderful video! Everyone was absolutely amazing! Love you Mitch and everyone else! Y'all need to come to Ky and perform, I guarantee I would be the first one there. With all my health issues your music helps me get through my day to day medical hell
The auto-tune is JARRING at points.
I love you guys
4:01  🫶
why isn't this in spotify? :'))
Sonique - feel so good is amazing. Dat beat
They should’ve ended with Cher’s song. Matt doing that solo was great.
OMFG, WOW WOW WOW THAT WAS AWESOME !!!! I know each song they were singing and they all killed it. They are so good. I give them an ovation :)
Listen to this over and over again
have they try bollywood/ bollywood mix + pride mix?
omg == 3 words for tis group == talent talent TALENT -- why don't we here more about this group
This helped me remember some of these songs, especially Beautiful Life by ace of base. My mom used to play that song for my siblings and I consistently.
If they make whole this music tracks, I’ll DEFINITELY buy it. It only contains my favorite musics… PLEASE MAKE IT😭
Holy CRAP when Mitch came in with, 'Everybody dance now!' ....
Sonique.. The memories... Good job!
Gotta love how the song "Believe" had 4 different lead singers
My brother love this song
PTX back with the nostalgia <3 <3
Made me realize that I'm in love with the 90's and proud to see that there is, I think, only one song for which i can't find the name :) :) Hey from France !
Is this a capella still!?😮 Amazing! I think I'm a bit old for their music but my souls not listening 😅😍
Love this!!! More please!!! :-)
Would love to hear a whole album of this, PLEASE.
I would pay a lot of money for a 90's dance covers album ijs
Porfavor fação uma de sea shanty  wellerman
It’s impossible not to move along with these songs and smile and sing along. A full length album featuring each these songs would be incredible…
ぞくぞくした！！！！ めっちゃかっこいい！！！！
2:56
🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
What is love. COVER, PLEASE
What an amazing melody! Totally brought me back to the 90’s. I feel ashamed though for not releasing that Everytime We Touch was a cover. I had to Google it. And I also never heard the Deep Inside song growing up, but totally knew and was singing along to everything else.
1:00 Holy shit this doesn't sound like acapella, it legit sounds like instruments! How do you guys get your voices to do that? You guys are amazing and this medley brings back such feelings of nostalgia lol, well done!
It’s been a year and i still cannot get over how good scott looks in that yellow jacket and sunglasses
귀걸이에 수염에 겁나 느끼해졌네
What did she do to herself…
aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh....you're just amazing, you singed my favourite songs during my youngness!!!!!!
Obsessed at 2mins 🥰
Spot the draco😈 biggest crimes against humanity subscribe 👺😈✌❤
I was born in 71 so the 80s is more my era, but I like some 90s stuff. I loved every one of these songs and the video is phenomenal!!
2:14 is best part for me
Thank you for this, you wonderful people.  I lost my memory of the 90s (class of 95) courtesy of a brain aneurysm in 2002. However, I get flashes & glimpses through the music of the time and one of the parts of the decade I have completely lost was the dance music. You pulled me back to the best years of my life.  Thank you!  Also, the 90s looks amazing on you, Kirsten. Especially the hair. ❤️
What a great performance you did 😍😍😍 specially sounique cascada and iam blue thanks a lot for bringing me memories of those days
If songs had a voice they would be petioinining against being unwillingly put through a butchers grinder right now
Where I can get the blue jacket like this guy has?
how am I only finding out about this treasure now? I'm completely obsessed. ♥
Echt cool gemacht.
Só sucesso... impossível ficar parado. Show!!!!
Anitta?? Joke! Sou brasileiro e sempre amei o Pentatonix desde "evolution of music"...Saudações do Brazil!
OMG!
Please guys, make a Tatu Medley! That would SO EPIC!
It’s amazing
Una maravilla 🥰
Rhythm Is A Dancer was better than the original imo!
BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love mitch and the rest of the group have excellent voices ❤
Son maravillosos...👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💞❤🌹🙏🤩🥰
Hi ich hab eine frage? Wan kommt es auch auf Spotify zum hören? Lg
Guys! Do a full cover of Sonique!
👌
🥰
Love at first sight!🔥 You are amazing👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is Amazing!
God it's beautiful 🥰🥰🥰
Ребятки - это великолепно! У вас удивительные голоса. 🤩😍
Huge bass fan!
They should make full versions of these songs Pentatonix style. I'd go and download all of them. Well done!
Scoot be killing the LOOK💓💓💓
Youre so genius
I'm like 90% sure there autotune was used, not cool.
Why is this medley not on spotify??????? 😱
I feel old now, but I thought a few of these were 80's hits
Kirsten’s face is frozen and it looks like it hurts to move her mouth
Can we get this on Apple Music
you are guys just revive all the songs
Супер🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍
A FULL CHER’S BELIEVE PLEASE 😭
I hope these individual songs come out
Love it!! That sound effect on the bass.. what is it called. It gives it an octave lower note..
The only album i would buy. Pleaseeeeee make this an album!!!!!!
Complimenti... Mi avete fatto rivivere quegli anni magici
My fav song
1st world problem: I want full versions from them of most of these singles.
Except around the world lalalalala by ATC was 2000
Giving Grammy Winner realness..
Please full song of Cascada - Everytime we touch
I swear, they honestly need their own versions of the individual songs in the melodies. I love Mitch's run on What is Love
every song from Night At The Roxbury.
👏👏👏
beautufill !!
Did they get a new lady, or did the old one change her look and stop making The Face?
As much as I like this, it's not actually a very good medley, as a good one would would seamlessly transition between one song segment and the next, or cleanly overlap so the transition is completely unobservable, and while a few of the transitions are just fine, the majority of them are just "heartbeat pause, next song segment", and it's jarring.
Cher sent me <3
here's a couple challenges for you Pentatonix... enter sandman by metallica, patience by guns and roses. and welcome to the jungle also by guns and roses i'd love to here your versions of these epic songs
👏👏👏👏..AMEI😁
HAPPY PRIDE!!!
0:20
You need to do I2I from A Goofy Movie
Why they are dressing 80s? Rule number 1 for 90s make up,  do not wear it... But metallic lip gloss. There is a guy on blac9t shirt and vest, the only one looking 90s 😁
Such a great decade, you represented it so well! 😁
this is insane
My heart melt, back to the 90's and the good times. They nailed almsot every hit song. So good and so many memories! <3
Pentatonix + Cascada? QUE COMBO SENHORES <3
i never knew i wanted a Pentatonix cover of Everytime We Touch so much in my life. now i can't live without it
Reminds me of much music’s Dance Mix ‘95
Mix good
No la encuentro en Spotify 😭😭😭😭
awwww Cascada, they remember
.... At least do more Cher covers? Please?
Stumbled onto this video through YT’s algorithm… thamn… what a voice artists. Ok… little nostalgic as well as I grew up on these tracks. Love it 😍
É a Sandra Annenberg de bigode?
Is "Blue" a 90s song??? And "Every time we touch"?
This video felt like meeting up with so many old friends, and lovers....... just amazing
ok, Pentatoxnix, you've teased us for over a year with this song.....now you should put out a video for each song in  this medley, but put some of that firey feugo Pentatonix Pepper on it......i would so buy a full album of these songs with Pentatonix's take on each one
люблю их в любом костюме и гриме.
👍🏼👍🏼
No words can describe the beauty they create with their fabulous voices. Otherworldly 🥰❤️😍
Best songs ever! Miss so bad!! Good generation!!
I think Mitch's diction at 3:06 is so crisp. Also their apparent joy is so contagious.
cuando se supera pentatonix?? cada vez que vuelvo a ellos mi corazon vuelve a la vida
WTF is this? sounds like glee auugh!!!
The acapella polka!  Weird Al would be proud.
Boom Boom Boom is 80s
Sound is on point, but the large collars are more 70s than in the 90s, also no sports jerseys? Also, no Hip hop/reggae/dance/house references? At least some Dr. DRE, please.
Omfg... Can we please have a full version of "Finally" ! Priscilla Queen of the Desert forever!
Siento que me falta uno, pero no me acuerdo de cuál es.
WOW .. Geniales chicos .. he visto 3 videos de ustedes.. hasta hoy tengo el placer de conocer su trabajo y me ha encantado ...
👏🏻👏🏻
These all need full covers.
Kirstin is such a babe
Hold up, I feel like i missed the group learning new tricks. Like, I'm used to hearing kevin impersonate a whole friggin orchestra with his mouth at this point, but...  Since when can the high pitched duo imitate autotune?! When did Kirsten learn to sing that low?! There's a dozen tricks in here I swear I aint heard them do before!
Men men men bros... Please do tell me, I am not the only one simping over her, am I? Its too difficult.
James Corden looks really young here
he is really rocking the pedostache lol
I really wish that Kirstin would stop with the plastic surgery. She used to be so naturally pretty. Now she has plastic surgery face.
They are actually so annoying
Good
Why does it sound so overly autotuned 🤦🏼‍♂️
Give me five.
THIS IS THE BEST AND LEGENDARY COVER i have ever listen...
Awesome, but that's more like a 90's and 2000's music medley, since some of those came much later in the 2000's.
Some of these songs are memes now
What about a Top Gun soundtrack medley?
Maître classe. Cracks. Cgrtz ....
I think just relived my entire 20s.  🥲
LETSDANCE🕺🕺🏻🕺🏼
This is 90s and 00s
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i can't look at that mustache, but this is a bop
¡¡Dios mío!! ¡¡Que pasada!!, cada vez me sorprendeis más, sois increíbles.🥰🥰🥰
the rendition they did of "everytime we touch" is more the of the 2000's version
Pentatonix should do a full cover of each song. Their versions sounds great for each snippet that they did.
Mr. Vain???
They are amazing! It would be great if you do something more extensive on those topics. Blessings!
Like, I haven't really listened to PTX in a while, and have just been feeling a bit disenchanted, I guess? But holy shit, this is such a vibe - just... Idk, it's like major nostalgia both for the songs and PTX themselves, big vibe  Edit: just got to the end and was disappointed that we didn't get a "Heyy!-" 😂😂
Wow 👋👋👋👋👋👋👏👏👏👏👐👐👐👐👐👐👍👍
Good
Alright i'll be hanging here for a while :x
I thought Joe Exotic is in prison, and now i see him in a striped suit in this video?
I've a fan for 11yrs... And I'm amazed EVERYTIME i hear them and my Fandom is renewed EVERYTIME... They are the best to do what they do.... 🙏🏾 🐐🐐🐐
Not that I’m too bothered that it was added to a 90s medley, but just for the record, “Everytime We Touch” was released in 2005. Still brings back some nostalgia though. 👍
my childhoooddd
Feels like I did time travel..Thanks!
She’s so damn gorgeous.
OMG it's was MAGICAL !!!
My FAVORITE music is 90’s club! Thank you for this
I may have love (and nostalgia, at least in places) for all decades of music, and I may associate some of these songs with later decades, but the 90s has always been a very nostalgic decade of music for me.  Awesomely fabulous video!
Faltaron tantos para que vean que las musica de los 90s están basta más que la música actual
This is amazing! <3
ISA Christus love s you
Most of these songs I either have never heard of, or just not the style music I'd listen to .  So when I do hear one of the originals that Pentatonix covers, I can't help but think of the cover as the original ... and better.  I find that it's the same with Dweizel Zappa and Weird Al, the "originals" are always disappointing compared to the covers.
👍🏻💪🏻👌🏻😎
You bunch are just amazing - every one of you.
Soooo cool!!!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
круто!!!
90's dance has always been my favorite  and every song they covered here I had either the band or compilation CD's. This could have gone on even longer as there were some songs missed like Another Night by Real McCoy. Needless to say, this mash up brought me joy!
Why can I only like this masterpiece just once?! I feel like I am listening my own playslist! XD
Please, please, please do some 80s songs too...
WOW WOW WOW. This got me all excited. Awesome
❤❤❤👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🎉🎉🎉
Show Me Love sounds AMAZING here!
👌
Need some rap next PLEASE! salt n peppa, blackstreet, dr dre, Tupac etc!!
This is amazing, they are amazing!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏 PS: was I the only one who thought the lyrics for Believe went: “do you believe in love after love”🫣??
Mitch makes a moustache work
It was so much better when you didnt do the duck faces and all. But good selection.
Matt, at the beginning of Blue (Da Ba Dee), is definitely me right now
I can’t believe how talented you are, it’s just genius
Is that a different female singer?
Instant fan here
Bravo a vous 5 (FRANCE)
Another petition for the full version of Cher's believe
Move over K-Tel
Wow
3:14 😍
I usually don't care for this group as they peddled Hallelujah as a god damn Xmas song. But I found this delightful and almost true, despite they never lived the time.
My four-year-old said she loved your music this is the 1st time she has listened to your music when I say thumbs up to all of you love you all.
great video 👍
PETITION FOR A FULL VERSION OF "BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM !!"  Such a joyful song is worthy of it. (≧▽≦)
Alter is das geil
The 90s were when music peaked. It's still good don't get me wrong, but the vibe was different.
Gives me shivers.
Toto - Africa pls
Everytime we touch pleaseee
They're good. But when I think of Pentatonix I think of the band with Avi. Just not the same without him to me. Like I expect to hear Avi's deep voice.
He reminds me of Don Corleone and Scarface
Not gonna lie didn't realize Everytime We Touch is that old
Ammaazziinngg!!
La música de casi toda mi infancia!!!
Wish I could double like 💜
WORST BAND IN HISTORY
Oh my gosh MORE!
Her best look ever!!!
I would LOVE to see their creative process of choosing the songs and arrangement for these mashups because they are BRILLIANT. no one does it better!!
HADDAWAY👍
We need a full version of all of these.
so after listening to 90s dance songs on youtube i see Pentatonix 90s mix, never heard of these guys so i listen i love it now i cant stop listening to all there songs they are fantastic. have all there songs on a playlist so when the family and i are driving around scotland on day trips the Pentatonix mix gets played :D my kids love them aswell :). would be great to see them live :D

Magic 🍀❤️🎹👍🎵🎼😘😊😁
i still dont like scotts whiney voice.. but mitch saves the day once again
Seriously fire
I’ve been listening to this group since they first come out. They are so under rated to the extent to where they tend to get lost in my music play list, then they come out with another song or pop up on my playlist and then I listen to them like crazy
Wait, WHAT? I can't believe you guys are singing all these 90 great songs! It's fantastic, it's perfect!! Absolutely love this! You guys are really phenomenal! I have no words to express how good you guys are, so I'll go with PERFECT!
just amazing, i have goosebumps xx love from the UK xx

Absolutly impressive
I wish this was longer with more songs.
Can we get a part 2 with sylver and then lasgo - something? Maybe also viva la vida and clocks in there too?

Mitch really carries it.
Wow, this is so good
2:56  🎶 oh i'm bluee  🎶  PAD THAI 🎶
Very disappointed that they used autotune.
This is amazing 🤩
cover yoasobi pleasee
Wow! Their voice effects at 1:52 really manage to bring out the vibe and atmosphere of the original song to their performance
My childhood in 5 minutes
Sehr gut und very good ;D
Yea, see, this sort of thing just makes me want to hear them cover the full versions. This is teasing
Full version of Cher Believe PLEASE!!! 💖
I luv you guys forever
damn....this really brought back a lot of memories
I want a full version of waiting for tonight. She looked so good singing that number.
I love everything about your group. I go through your playlist of songs everyday before and after work. Your songs cover so may emotions and I’m honored to listen to your music. We also need a full 90’s album
Is it sad I recognize or know most of these?
Nobody does a mashup/megamix quite like Pentatonix! Every song here speaks directly to my childhood! Thank you so much!
They are like leaders of enemy in Anime
Mitch is so cute
Omg this so cute I love this 🌹🌈🌸🌹🌈🌸
Transitions were flawless!  Crystal Waters to Ce Ce Peniston was sublime.
I want this song. AMAZING.
I love the pentatonlx 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳❤️❤️
2021 OMG
These people wouldn't last 5 mins in the 90s. We were pretty sweaty...
That was dope! 87' baby here reminiscing!😎😌🤙🏼
Waiting for 2000's dance Medley
Thx for bringing up these traumas...

The closest this generation will get to falling asleep and waking up at 3am to the TimeLife cd collection infomercials.

I miss the 90s' dance music. Thanks for including It Feels So Good (Sonique)

I love all your voices they are amazing!! ❤️❤️😃👍👍
BACK GROUND MUSIC IS TO LOUD
Simply great!!!! Hugs fron Chile
1990-2000 was like a decade long high school block party where most of the neighborhood just KNEW in their hearts that the bad time for America was over and the future would guarantee prosperity, security, fun, entertainment, financial security, health, hope, happiness, technology, and community forever. In 2001 it was like the cops showing up to the party to say everybody is under arrest. 2008 was the neighborhood being bulldozed to build a freeway. 2020 was running into an old neighbor who tells you everybody from the good old days died of cancer. 2022 is sitting under that freeway overpass in a tent jingling a cup in front of the chinese tourists and asking for change so you can get a fix and play songs that remind you of the 90’s. 2023 is a mushroom cloud and big brother. I hope i’m gone before 2024.
1:23 She have fantastic voice <3
Low key disappointed that there was no 'Barbie-Girl' in this mix. Pretty dope tho
Again. ONLY (city radio) american music of 90s. I wonder If we'll ever hear "misic of indian 90s" or "music of austrlian 90's".... You're so streamlined, I feel like you need your super comfy corner.
PLEASE I AM BEGGING DO A FULL COVER OF EVERYTIME WE TOUCH I AM BEGGINF I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCJH!!! IM A HUGE FAN!!
Matt's　smile is　very cute😊
I lost my absolute MIND at "Your love it feels so good," at 1:58 🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why do gays always have to be so obvious? You can be gay, just dont dress like dragqueen. Why would you even think you look okay? Jesus...
I love how many songs used autotune and synthesizers back then to achieve a certain sound, and PTX can do all of it naturally and they have to put a filter on them to make it sound like the autotune from the song :D
That’s fuckin cool 😎
i can't believe this is 1 year ago still saw it when they upload this
Please make full versions of all of these!! we need them <3 love you guys
damn this is RAD hahaha 😂 amazing arangements and the vocals are bomb but smooth the transitions are flawless..more pls
That was amazing! There are so many songs in there that I would loved to hear them preform the entire song. More 90’s songs… pleeeeeeese
The auto tune at 4:20 just hurts the heart
I am high key jealous of Kirstie's curls!!! Not fair!
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Pastor Murray is an Anointed Servant of GOD who teaches the Word of GOD with Authority!!!!!!!
release this to itunes? this is excellent.  and  would love to hear full version of 'everytime we touch'!
Just one song is not gonna make it. We need more. Many more for 90s medley.
good gawd I love yall
I'm I the only one to dream about a full cover of Rythm is a Dancer? Or even Waiting for Tonight
Your amazing
Full version of Believe plz.
Классно!!!!🥰
1:00 nooooo, sus labios, sus hermosos labios fueron corrompidos por la fama
90's... I was in my mid-late 20's. Dang I felt old...
Just amazing, guys!!!
No
Scott is gorgeous x
More medleys! 💗💗💗💗💗
GÉNIAL 🥰 I love it
Who did edit the video? Any references of the template for AE or Pr?

This but 2k
Signing
Love, love, loce this.❤️🎉 such good vibes.
Excelente, super, me encantó.♥️♥️🇨🇴🇨🇴
this medley tricks you into thinking that 90s dance music was actually good (it wasn't)
No Avi..NOT interested
The best of the best  love it....
Too many songs all at once. :(  A blend of 4 or 5 would be fantastic, but just a single line from each? /ThumbsDown
Do an 80’s version!
There is nothing NOTHING about this that is bad. This is heaven!
Sublime!!!
O melhor de todos!! Amooo essas vozes!!
00’s medley pls
Petition for full version of what is love 👋
Love the clean and crisp way this sounds.  Makes all the songs sound even better!
3:28 Scott looks like a librarian...
Ngl, I would cry tears of joy if Pentatonix did a cover of just Cher's song Believe. Something about Mitch's voice in that techno-like filter is so amazing to me that I kept playing that whole section of the medley over and over again
Magnífico!!!!
well that cured my need to teach kids any instruments...
круто то что знаю все эти песни😎❤️
I can hereby confirm that 13 million of these views are from me, myself and I alone, and there's  absolutely no shame on my part!!🤣🤣 This medley rocks!!
0:56
The part where Alice DJ - Better Off Alone - is literally better than the original :D
They should do a beatles riff, that would be sound if done right
Costumes for 90s is shocking. Still good to listen to. Could be a british thing. 90s we was in shell suits
Really bad transitionS
💛💛💛💛💛/💛💛💛💛💛
I bet you would kill on "Walk Like an Egyptian"
les best
2000s would be nice
Please do another!!!!!! This was amazing!!!!!
Amazing! Brings back so many good memories growing up 😁🕺
I wish there was Dragostea Den Tei. 😅
can I have an hour-long version?
Makes me feel such joy and such sadness all at once. Unmatched energy…. This particular era of time. Fantastic every time.
4:02 Man, Matt has a beautiful voice
🥰🔊
We need Eiffel 56 blues complete version
Love it. Thank you 🙏🏼   Kevin, easy on the teeth whitening bruh
I wish this was on Spotify 😭😭😭 I’d literally listen to just this song for the rest of my life 🤣
Finally, a good cover for intros from RetroFM
Can we get another 0s dance medley please....this one is so damn good i hate it everytime it ends
Bahamas in 2 weeks baby..... can't wait to see this live
Simply fantastic. I would also listen to the mix of the 80s.
Can you guys make a full version of every song in the video love to see and hear how these great voices can sing these hits in 2022
They look like clowns now wtf are they doing to themselves
super
Heart explosion!!!!
I've never heard of this group before but I kept seeing the name pop up a lot on YouTube so I thought I'd listen to them. I'm very impressed I love their Style and I love the way they gave each and every one of those songs a little bit of their own flavor. I'm definitely going to do more research into these guys
amazing
i’m crying 😭
the way Kirstin shines here, damn good. Just perfect ♥
5 minutes back to my childhood <3
Could listen this whole weeks!! 😱😱😱
Conheço Pentatonix há anos e a qualidade só impressiona, sempre melhor a cada vídeo. Amooooooooooooooooooo.
"Better off Alone" 😍😍
"80s Medley" by Pentatonix????

So fun!! Lying in bed with co.vid, this really lifted my spirits. Xxx
I absolutely love this, and you guys 🥲✨
Best a capella Band of the world
This is AWESOME!! I’ve always loved your versions of dance tunes, this is EPIC!!💜
90s revolution
What a blast from the past! WHOO! Enjoyed this SO MUCH!
👏👏👏👏👏

Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!! I have been so goosebump!
Better than the original. 😎👌💙💙💙🔥🔥🔥
👏👏👏👏👏💖
Magical ❤️
(E.p.I.c) ^ 5
Wow, this was just, wow!!! I hope they do a part 2 of this.  My fantasy mix would have: Sweet Dreams- La Bouche.  What else would you add to the mix?
Прикольная красотка!))) подписка!
I missed all of these!!!!
Heard you guys took cash for pushing the vax. Is this true?
Do you really need so much makeup and autotune to be famous? Ffs, my ears bleeding!
Don't know why I haven't listened to this medley yet but I just saw half my life just flash right before my eyes in the best possible way. Petition to a full version of all the songs! So amazing, thanks a lot guys, love you and your music.
How do they make themselves sound like Autotune?!!  This is Witchcraft!
Full Version of "Believe - Cher" please! 🥰👌🏻
Please! Do all "It's a beautiful life"!❤️
Are these vocoder sounds also only made with the mouth, or are they edited?
This is always so cringy... Hahahaha
I get chills every time they get to the Cascada part
Oh, my God!  This is _amazing!_
OMG!!! SO SLICK!!! Gets me up and jumpin'! You guys are awesome!! Love that last drag note / mic drop!!
They took those dreadful songs from the 90's and gave them depth and harmony! Made them truly enjoyable and worth getting stuck in your head.
hello, hinahanap q si Ian Ezekiel na nakilala q sa RPW, nasabi nya po sken na fav song nya po ang pentatonix, kaya nandito aq para hanapin si Ian Ezekiel, kung nakikinig k man ng mga kanta ng pentatonix ngayon Ian Ezekiel, balik ka na, 'di na q galit, charot
I miss the 90s
It would be fun if they did iconic opening songs to shows, commercial jingles, etc. I’d love to hear them go from bill nye the science guy to where in the world is Carmen sandiego to SpongeBob to anything newer like bluey 😂
so consegui prestar atencao nas harmonizacoes e nos botox kkkkkkkkkk amo <3
Petition for a full version of ... well... all the songs!! This medley DESERVES to be a playlist!!  ✋🏻
Is this on Spotify?
我绝对是生错年份了XD
That beatboxing tho…
Супер! Супер! Супер!!
I have no idea what i just watched...but i loved it!!!
Группа супер. Моя любовь.
When great singers are auto tuned it is just embarrassing and painful to listen to for anyone with an ear for music. Fire your producer.
OMG this is good and reminding me of my old party days!  You even had Vengaboys and Hathaway in this mix! ❤️
Wannabe and Barbie girl 🤷🏼‍♀️
Pls do queen medley
All these songs are bringing me back!!!!
Is ver nice
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️

Obsessed w this✌🏼
I liked the video even before it started. I knew it was going to be gods but it's f amazing!
Loved this: my teenaged years.
Why this song is not in Spotify?
❤️
My only objection is that "Everytime We Touch" is a 00's song.
They forgot "Get Ready for This," by 2 Unlimited.  Unforgivable.
Please evolution music of celine dion
they're the best 😁
So long?  Forever ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

Tokio with mustache?
I panicked then thinking cascada was in the 90s no 2006 the original was the 90s 😂 felt so old then
Tell me this is just a teaser trailer with a snippet of each song for a new album, right? Right?
They smash every song they do love um
Arrasaram ❤
Whoa! Mitch singing Cher 🤩
Wer are you
This slaps so f**k**g hard.
Miss the old group.
Dammit now I want a new 90s playlist lol
WTF happened to Pentatonix? They look like WOKE threw up and the stain gained sentience.
So fucking cringe
Omg Mitch’s notes for better off alone are insane
Please take me back to 90s
получила эстетическое удовольствие)
We need the 90s music 🎶 to come back
It sucks the other guys is not there with you guys idk his name but he did the deep vocals  But you guys a new guy he's good too you all are great 👍 👌 👏 😉 😊
I LOVE YOU GUYS YOU ARE SO TALENTED ❤️
PTX ya are so awesome I was born on the 1990  In my opinion the 80s and 90s had the best music 🎶 especially with 90s techno my favorite music 🎶 the techno now is not the same
I love the fact that Matt changed outfits 🤣
Please give us more of Kirstie on lead vocals! She's fantastic
but can they do depeche mode....?
Loooooooove this … so happy … also a bloody talented bunch… made our night … just great ❤️🇺🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Man our music was lit!!! 🔥🔥🔥💜💜
Love Pentatonix so much!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
This pretty cool.  I dont remember dancing to this in the 90s.  I was to the R&B bumping n grinding music that was going on, still do.
раж
Are they just using there voices...? Thatzzzz crazy!
How am I only just finding these 🖖🤣🖖🙃💥💥💥💥💥💥
well, bad there is so much audiotune, can't sound good in acapella :(
omgosh Kristin, LOVE the curls! :D <3  PTX is outstandingly talented!
Oh autotune always sound so nice
You have summarised 5 years of some of the best years of my life
very good!
I come here for serotonin boost ✨
Pentatonix singing my fave european 90s club classics, loving it! Pentatonix, you are so special-so much fun and energy, brilliant!
I’m dying to have this on Apple Music or any streaming platform really… this is way too good..
I'd love to see a boy band Mashup.  Nsync, BSB, New Kids, 98°, Hanson, etc
every single one of these looks is peak gender
I am more distracted by their outifits and looks because I love it soo much
Masterful. ⭐️
I found Pentatonix like 30minutes ago.. Damn! What a perfection! I'd listen so much of your music, but this one's incredible!! 💯 You've put a sun in my day! 🙏
oh man talk about flashbacks
When I read the title I thought to myself 'Be My Lover" By La Bouche gotta be in there somewhere . . . pressed play and BOOOOOOOM . . . nostalgic smiles for the next 5 mins
I feel like i'm watching this video through an instagram filter
...hard to believe these singers call themselves "Christian"!
It's very cool 😎 👌 👍 😊 🙂
This was EPIC. 💣💥🤯
💯❤❤❤❤❤👍
Corny af!
Wow. Didn’t know Pat McAfee could sing like that.
Bomb
So cool presentation🤩😻now I want to play all of this songs. Love you all💖
genial!
I haven't vibed so hard in my life before😎✨
OMG that totally brought back my old clubbing days in the 90's. Spent most of the 90's pissed lol
A little late to the game, but how on earth did they do the electronic voices?! That's so amazing. They are so far beyond talented. Love love love them!
This is 🔥 I've been playing this video nonstop and when I stop I come back and listen to it again lol
WE NEED THE FULL VERSION OF "EVERY TIME WE TOUCH" OMG
круто

I am subscribing again, I was secretly unsubed by YT
This was fire
so freaking good 🙌
Sad this number is not on Spotify....😔😔
Beatboxer and bass are the MVPs for real.
So great the only ones I think were missed for the iconic 90s dance were Macarena by Los Del Rio and Livin La Vida Loca by Ricky Martin.  You hit so many iconic ones tho
How am I just watching this just now? Man, wish there was a longer version. This was badass! 🤘🏼
Wow!!!!
❤️💃🥰
Ouiiiiiii! Please
I have loved Pentatonix since the beginning… for some reason I hear this mashup only now, I can’t describe how satisfied and happy it makes me feel! Now you guys please do Everytime we touch full version!
Very Partridge.
Mustache man was made for this !!!!
I demand full versions of all these songs! Please
Is mitch auto tuned in this? Bc if that's natural that's crazy
Being a young man in the early 90's. This is my favorite!
😎😎😎😎😎😍
Amazing!!!!
This brought me back, wow. Wonderfully done.
I remember the 90s, would love them to do a whole album of 90s dance music I play this and dance round the house
Mis AVI!!!
what r u the nitro club?
This is amazing. I loved this I was in high school in the 90's. Every song brought up so many memories. I knew every song. Awesome job!
My ears have officially been blessed.
So geil 😎
Y'all are AMAZING! I think y'all hit every single one of my favorite 90s dance songs! Now I have to go find a playlist to jam to today 😂 I used to have a Pulse CD that had so many of these songs, and that's what I would put on to clean to 😂
I would love to hear "Groove is in the heart".
What the hell happened to that chicks mouth? She looks like a different person… Too far 🙁
OMG all of this... bringing me back! Amazing! Love all this.
So dang good, full album please.
Adorei, que saudades ...me transportou para esse tempo

Perfection 🤌🥰
I have such a soft spot for 90s dance anthems and euro pop… this is so addicting
Gotta give it to her.. Kristi does have a perfect 90s voice 💯💯
What is James Gorden doing in there? Lol
i have always loved this group, my only complaint is that they do not have an original song. nothing but covers of others work.
Everytime we touch was in the 00s not 90s
Mitch is starting to look more and more like Freddie Mercury 😅
Artist: Cascada  Album: Everytime We Touch  Released: 2006  Not 90s
Does every sound come from them!? It's truly incredible! Imagine having this Amazing talent! I wish I could sing just a little bit.
Gooooooood... like like
Please... an extended versión of all this songss pleaseeeeeee
Simplesmente perfeitos! 🙌🙌🙌
Awesome
Damn, you guys are taking me back to the DDR arcade! I'd love to hear some Britney Spears, MC Hammer, and Backstreet Boys!
love the tasteful use of autotune 😌👌
They are so cringe. Their facial expressions and the way they exaggerate their generic boring voices. Awful.
Could you please do an album for all these songs. This is brilliant!! Thumbs up to get their attention
Son los mejores!
Excellent Video!
👍👍👍👍👍👍
The Cascada to Eiffel 65 hit especially hard. I love this 😍
ms mammasssss atteeeeee this!!!
Donde esta el autotune que dicen la gente que se escucha mentirosos viva el acapella
Wow 😍 Mitch Has a Beautiful Voice And High level Great Job Pentatonix Is Doing 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💗👏😊
Not only are you amazing at singing, you're so good with transitions
You can hear the transition from disco theme to modern techno
You brought the 90's to life for me as I only knew a few songs and you guys did it so awesome, as usual.  Love them.  Suggestion, if you can do 90's, I would love to hear you guys do a 50's and 60's Medley as there were some awesome a Capella groups back then and would love to see how you would do many of their songs, like Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons or many other groups of that era.  Thanking you in advance.
OMG that Silver top is FIRE!!🔥
Nice 20 second rips. No Copyright claims
WHY IS THIS NOT ON APPLE MUSIC @PENTATONIX
Love 💘 it back the old days.  Awesome
Hope there's Kylie Minogue :(
Please tell me you have full versions of every single song you did
Can I find that on apple music?
Mbappé is a master of beatbox
Makes me feel old. I am. I would love to hear Awake by your group it would be awesome.
what's the name of this beautiful woman ??
You play and sing beautifully, but there is a more beautiful soloist than these songs
Jesus, this is incredible. I'm having a hard time believing even the percussion is fully voiced. Please tell me that at least the autotune effect on Believe was from a box...
Plz 00,s Hiphop Medley
My whole childhood in just 5 min and 43 sec! Thanks for the ride! Next up: Pentatonix - 80s Dance Medley  ..... please! Need to hear your version of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" since I got a small tiny taste of it from the React Channel.
I absolutely need a full version of "ATC - All Around the World (La La La)" pleeeeeeeeeeeaseeee!!!  🤩
Clearly a very talented bunch. Awesome work! Great editing of the video 📹! 😁
I would like to buy this song. I wish this was an album.
I hate that I'm just seeing this now. I was born in 81 and I could tell you every song and who sang it. This was my playlist. How crazy is that? Every song!!
And waiting for tonight
Every time we touch and do you believe please
Do a full version of it feels good by Sonique love that song
This is my petition for Pentatonix to do a cover of Viva Forever by the Spice Girls
Omg please make a full version of Chers "Believe". It sounds just amazing! I'm in love with this part! 😍❤
Brilliant !❤️❤️❤️
Yow they use to have fun in the 90's!  Now we have Dua Lipa!
Eifel 65 is really cool!
I love the version from ATC 😻
Love it! 90's baby!
The one guy is Joe Exotic's offspring right?
А в чем прикол? Открывать рот под фонограмму? И делать многозадачные лица
where MODERN TALKING?????😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
Legend never dies
That was AWSOME! Thank you Pentatonix for taking me back to my 20s and living in Frankfurt Germany!
Songs that you can't help but sing along ♡. Forever a 90s baby . This music gives me so much nostalgia 😩.   They dont make music like this anymore
There is absolutely no way to listen to you guys in the car without watching the videos. You all are amazing and i have to watch as i listen to see the beats and musical sounds. Totally awesome!!
i think this was the only time that I'm expecting for a rick roll
Mitch - wow!
THEY SNATCHED MY WIG RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WITH THAT LA BOUCHE THO
No 'Where Do You Go' by No Mercy?
This brought such a wave of nostalgia over me. Your rendition of these songs is so beautiful 🤩 Thank you so much for this.
Gold!
Tienen que hacer una versión de los 80😃😅 🥳 sería súper genial también 💕💕 Saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷
wish they would do "Africa" and "Rosanna" from TOTO
autotune lvl 9000
I needed this tonight lol, I was a DJ when most of these songs were older but still very popular.
Ich Liebe Pentatonix :)
I can’t be the only who feel so good listening to Sonique’s It Feels So Good…!!! Petition for this song and Be My Lover in FULL!
I feel soooo olddddddd lol
Holy crap. Throwback.  Eiffel 65
Bonjour bonsoir, il aurait été bien de faire les années 80 aussi. Merci pour vos performances. Vous êtes super 😎😋😋😋👍👍👍👍👍
For ones i'm thankfull to YouTube's algorithm for recomending me this, this is the best pick me up playlist i didn't know i needed
Didnt know Kylian Mbappe sings with Pentatonix, good job man...
This gave me chills. Their voice + nostalgia... Amazing
I remember 'Everytime We Touch' coming out in 2005.
THANKS FOR THE SOUNDTRACK OF PART OF MY LIFE!!! I can remember when I listened to my tape recorders!!!
Sign
Great mix of covers 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
when will they stop to soothe me.  This is so complex, compelling and easy at the same time. Obviousely the voice acting is incredible. But production and song choice is out of the box too.  Soo many songs to chose from and all voice parts and voice lines just melt into each other.. Don't wan't to know how much actual work hous went into this. No question that this is a commercial powerhouse. But knowing this and being an audiophile I still just F***** enjoy it. Thank you.
I'm addicted to this medley 😍
Crazy awesome!
Freddy Mercury 2.0 has really been killing it lately. His voice is incredible.
Wait... They no longer have a bass?
I would love to hear a full version of "Beautiful Life" by Ace of Base
You're all so talented.
You had me at 90's music...and Pentatonix....
My 90s Eurodance loving heart can’t take it !!!!!😭😭😭❤️🥺🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 CHILLLLLSSS THE ENTIRE VIDEO I LOVEEEEE XOXOXOX❤️❤️

Thanks for making me feel old. I'm 39 but now feel 59. 👴
We need full versions of like. All of these
I used to love you guys so much, but fell off. This is the first song in years and honestly I did not enjoy. Every voice and the beat felt off to me and not right for the songs chosen. Maybe it's just me, but not my favorite but far. I wish you the best in your careers but I think I'll stick to the old stuff, if I continue to listen. Good luck all of you. Your talented in a field I could never be in.
Brutal.

The voice of Mitch is angelical!!
Maravilhosos,um Dom Perfeito que Deus lhes deu 🙏🙌🤩🥰
🇩🇴🇩🇴🙏🙏🇩🇴🇩🇴 Bendiciones 🙏 desde República Dominicana 🇩🇴
Another project I think would be great...Covers of the songs from the Movie The Prince of Egypt.  I think listening the singing "Through Heaven's Eyes" and "Playing with the Big Boys Now" would be awesome.
I love this medley!  Excellent work.  Please make full versions of all these songs.
Vengaboys & Eiffel 65  SWEET!!!😁  2 things I'd like to point out though.  Everytime We Touch (Cascada's version) is from the 00s. Waiting for Tonight wasn't originally by Jennifer Lopez. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8PQAqbtTiE  Also, they included some songs that I didn't think were popular.  It Feels So Good - Sonique & Deep Inside - Little Louie Vega / Hardrive  There are others that I think might be more popular than those.
Enjoy it so much
Amazing! 😍😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Os cara são bom irmão
2:49 goes hard
Full version of boom boom boom boom pleaseeeeee and everytime we touch x
Arrasou amooooooooo❤️😍
3:01 Now we are talking
0:46 AROUND THE WORD BY ATC
Is there a version with the actual music? This is the perfect medley.
I’M BLUE DABUDEE DABUDAAA
Everytime we touch is a 00s song though. However your rendition of it was sublime. And this medley was awesome .
💖💖Fantastic !!! Oh the memories this brought back. As someone that spent their teen years and early 20’s during this time era , hearing my favorites made me smile and dance in my seat.
Sonique It feels so good Full version 😦
God damn it I know all these songs you dang young people . . . . I love you. but in realizing how old I am. that song finally. . .  . oracilla queen of the desert. probably one of my favorite songs and movies
and damn it blue man group
boom boom boom. come on man. that's a low old song
damn youz guys. singing songs from. the 80 you make me feel old
As a bass, I feel it important to make this one critical note: Mitch ain't right.   Amazing work as always, folks.
I'm a huge fan, and I really don't like what I think I'm hearing in this arrangement.  At 4:16/4:20 it REALLY sounds like Kirstin is autotuned.  Also again at 4:38 it sounds like Mitch is as well.
Класс, талантливые
It's just yet another day for Mitch and his style  and a dressing up day for others;)
achei que o grupo perdeu um pouco da essência com a saída do baixo mas esse vídeo eles mandaram muito bem...
Amazing talent and beautiful people
Wish they’d replace the ginger dude.
This is so amazing, a complete mood booster!
Pentatonix you are so amazing ♥️
I'm gonna need a full version of Believe, please and thank you

Voces sao incriveis!
Best yet!!!
I love all of your outfits, do you yourselves design them?
Did they use reverb on a couple of parts?! I hope not
I've always thought that Everytime we touch was an original Cascada's song
This is pure joy . It’s uplifting . So much better than all of the droney crap on the radio . Why can’t they play this instead
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓❤️
speechless
O ruim é que acaba ! Kk
A breath of fresh air 😌

When is it on spotify
Dude needs to drop the creeper Stache
THE   BEST  <3
You guys rock! Goosebumps all over the body
Absolutely great! Besides the fact that you did something that not many people do, namely you brought the music of the 90's now in a single video, a music that may never die in my opinion, but also the transition from one song to another. ..I'm just speechless, congratulations, you are absolutely amazing
Can you do the an 80's Dance Medley? Loved you since
I loved it, but am heartbroken there wasn't a "maya-heeee, Maya-hooo, Maya-hahaaaa! in there, lol.  Oh, well nevermind, it was released in 2004. It's so 90's though!
Please full version of "all around the world" please Pentatonix fam🙏🙏🙏
I heartily agree!
Lol, it sounds like a Greatest Cocktail 🍹 of my memories of crazy 90's👍.. great job!!!!
PLEASE. We need a full 90’s album in 2022!!!!
Can we get a full version for "Believe"
Omg!  High school all over
I have a hard time listening to other music now! My ear nodules have been spoiled by you!  Thank you so much for working so hard and sharing your incredible gifts with the world! May nothing but peace and love come to you in the new year. @PTXofficial
Incroyable ! Quel talent ! 🔥🔥🔥
Super!!! Full version of all songs, please!!! Do it! It' s  will be a bomb!
oof, this hits right in my nostalgic heart
Wait ! What ! How’s I miss this. Keep ‘em comin Pentaamazing
I'm Dutch, so I'm curious how many Dutch artists you guys know and if that would make a viable medley/remix/mashup for/by Pentatonix and/or friends 😁
While I love supporting artists, merch prices are getting ridiculous. $40 for a baby onesie OR an adult t-shirt? $55 for a pair of boxer shorts? In what world does that make sense?!?!?!?
Cher Believe, a full to ❤️
We need this on Spotify!!!🤩
My god these folks are just awful. Self obsessed narcissists without an original thought to split amongst them. Over produced mediocrity for the mediocre. I’ve never been so underwhelmed….
Can we get full versions of every song?  🥺
C'est magnifique, toute mon enfance. Vous êtes géniaux. Merci beaucoup.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
All I could think about was a night in the Roxbury.
this is more like a miming karaoke glee style, disappointed
No but why is everyone commenting now?? Or did everyone just collectively watch one pentatonix vid and get stuck for hours in a rabbit hole of vids cuz same lmfao
OMG please do a full version of Blue.  That was amazing.
Impecable como siempre
Please don't destroy me in the comments lol but I'm new to Pentatonix; did they actually use auto-tune on a couple songs or are they somehow able to imitate that sound with their voices? If so my respect for them is going to go through the roof!
You guys are Brilliant!! Love your videos!!
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS FOR NEARLY A YEAR???
This actually put me in a better mood, totally needed to listen to this today :)
Amazing!! I love BELIEVE!!
Wow this is amazing 👏 😍
This is so good. I love this👌👌

I'm 18 almost 19, and it's only now that I realize just how grateful I am to my mother for listening to this music around me growing up. I used to think it was cheesy but it's grown on me so much.
Ugh so good!!!

Morning jam🥰
Кого то не хватает в составе
메들리 말고 한 곡 한 곡 불러줘도 정말 좋을 것 같아요~ 펜타토닉스 완전 초기부터 팬으로서 정말 다 듣고 싶어요~~ I want to listen to every song one by one.  From I am a longtime fan of you.
I had goosebumps at every song! That was awesome!!!
C'est bien mais Avi Kaplan me manque quand même :/ Sa voix rajoutais quelque chose de fort au groupe.
Awesome
O - M - G !!! 😩❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥
ATC - around the world was from summer 2000. I rember it clearly cuz  my auntie died this summer and it was her last fav song.
I would have loved to have played this track in the mix back in those days...90'S never die !!
I cannot believe my husband and I grew up long enough but we are getting old for this.... It will always be the best album
Genius. Hell yeah! I'm happy n I'm gonna be FOREVER. TY.
Can we appreciate kristie’s outfits 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰
Full version of Believe. Please💙
Que perfeitoooooo!!!
Thank you for taking me back to my 20s Pentatonix.  I miss the 90s, and being young, as my body ages (my mind is still 25).  A special shout out to Kirstin for rocking the glomesh.
no one: every ship AMV in 2000s: 2:14
I love you all❤❤wonderful voice
PERFEEEEECT!!!
With this performance, they have touched me, because it represents the sound track of my life as a teenager in the nineties, above all, when I was studying at my high school.
Awesome guys!!! 🤩✨
I love all the music numbers from here.
Vi amo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💋💖💖
They just get better every time
My only favorite people!
Круто 👍👍👍
We need a full version of BELIEVE BY CHER!!!
Believe by Cher got me! Nostalgia came flooding in instantly.
Los 90 fue la última y gran época d la música dance... luego hay canciones sueltas, pero no hubo tantos hits como n esa década, la mejor, sin duda
Soooo…. many….. memories…….   Too bad I can only hit that like button once
♥♥♥♥
This group blows my mind everytime I hear them! Amazing!
too much autotune. you guys used to be so good. sad
Muy buenos artistas  exelente
Short changed by the lack of Gypsy Woman
Think they need to double check what 90s means. Not all these songs are from the 90s.
good mix feld like i was 17 again :)
LOVE!!!!!!
I'd like to have every song in full version :D  In german: Geiler Scheiß (that means that it sounds great)
Man this is taking back to my London clubbing days ! I love this !
OMG....i am old but let me tell you there has never been a better group in my mind.....i am not a person that listens to much music but i can't get enough of you guys.......thank you so much.....
Petition for a full version of "Believe" by Cher💙

I'm an 80s teen.  I loved the 90s because of the diversity in music.  This was awesome 👌.   I loved Garth, Kurt Cobain and all this beautiful pop music!  What an awesome time to have been a beautiful young woman 👧
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I'm sorry, but Scott and Kevin rock this version! Of course these couldn't happen without Kirsty, Matt or the super star Mitch.
i love that u guys did gypsy woman
Now that's a throwback to way back when life was easier (at least for me of course)
This brought me back to my childhood....  thank you for this
Buenisimos!!!
Vi AMO
Fa..k, very good👍👍👍👍
Scott really be feeling himself with those glasses
EXCEPTIONAL ❤
Very very very very very very GOOD GOOD

Congrats Kevin!  I would love to hear more Mika!!!! Scott killed it on TikTok 💕 I'm just super bummed that you'll probably never come to my city in Canada, and my great Dane has anxiety, so I won't get to travel to see you😢 Happy Holidays!
я хочу выглядеть как парень в белом пиджаке в конце видео,он брутальный
¿Como se llama la segunda canción?

Обожаю Вас

How iconic
keeps getting better and better. but I’m distracted with Kirstin’s lips 🙁 I missed her side grin.. it used to be so full of expression. still love you guys though.
im in love with all of u)) but u loose a great bass!!!
I love this!! But didn't Everytime We Touch come out in 2006?
Super ❤️
All the best ones are the shortest 💀
Всё время хочется слушать эту песню
We need an extended version. :)
This brought me back to 6th grade at the roller rink. In a good way.
いちいちオシャレなんだよなぁ
Is it on spotify?
How the F did MacAraina get missed?😱
To make this video, every member of the group had to record each song by themselves having no idea what parts would be used in the video. Amazing talent on display.
Say what you will about the 90's. It had some great pop songs
I can't stop staring at her hair!!!!!!!!!!
J'adore trop ce mégamix !!!!!! ça me rappele ma jeunesse !  J'aimerai qu'il y ai un album entier please
Ngl the blonde haired guy(forgot his name) looks like one of the guys on ASAP science
Lort knows i just wanna be in one of the videos
Goosebumps from start to finish...another masterpiece
Wow! Just beautifully done👏👏
They are still the best Acapella group.
Wow this is amazing
This group never ceases to amaze
My childhood 😁 well done
nice
It’s a long shot, but who know, if comments get read - I would love to see Pentatonix take on an 80’s Teena Marie track: Cradle Rob & Me… hell, I would love an all Teena mix… file this in the request bin please.
why look the gay one (dont know the name) like Gunter without sunglasses? xD
Can we please get a version of this for our phones. Whether it’s a video or audio song. Just something on iTunes or Apple Music pleaseeeeeeee ❤️
Where is Avi?
1993 - 2008   the 90s..
Top! Muito bom! Adorei!
I can't stop listening to this
Sorry guys, but they need to get rid of Scott. Everyone else is so much better, & it hurts to see him bringing everyone else down. My dog can sing better that Scott Hoying - & he's so much less annoying.
A full version of blue da bee dee
sad face. They are using tricks now.
прикиньте, а вот было так - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSUFzC6_fp8  9 лет прошло!!!!!!!!!!!
Every song in Dance Dance Revolution
Deep all over chills. Beautiful ❤️❤️💯💯
Una pasada!!!! Maravilloso 👏
Omg i want a full album!
Why isn't this medley on Spotify? I want to be able to listen to it there!
Memories turn around~ In Korea, 90s pop songs are running backwards at the roller skating rink. I also often go to the roller skating rink ~ Reminds me of the past ~ 👍👏😁
FIRST UP SCOTT HOYING YOUR VOCALS ARE AMAZING THEN MITCH G THE SAME THEN K.M. SAME THEN MATT SAME AND LAST KEVIN .O. SAME
I LOVE IT SO MUCH
GOOD SONG
pentatonix am get you tickets am to see ptx so happy now am go my pentatonix AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IN SUGARLAND
Oh my goodness this is BEAUTIFUL!!!
💓♥️❤️だいすきです。
Wait. Is this just a video? It’s awesome but I don’t recall it being on an album anywhere.
4:10😀
You guys are beyond amazing. My heart melts with every song.
The originals were bad.  PTX makes them sound good.  Most of the music from the 90's was horrid, this was a nice revival.
4:31
Anitta in Pentatonix haha
UAU! Uhuuuuuu! Que maravilha! Vocês são demais! 🇧🇷🇧🇷
요즘 낮에도 밤에도 이 노래만 듣고있어요. 영상도 함께 보고 있어요. 모두 다 매력적이지만 제가 가장 좋아하는 두 사람 스캇과 미치를 보는게 너무 즐거워요. 스캇의 매력있고 상큼한 리액션과 미치의 은은하고 절제된 리액션이 대비되서 각각 더 매력적으로 느껴져요.
Yess!
I thought You were about to dance
Why not 80's? <3
It was a different time…
Wow! 👁👄👁
OMG crazy songs...
Вау 🤩
Upgraded incredibly cover! super amazing 💯
Kirstin Taylor Maldonado can get it!!!
Don't mean to nitpick but "Every Time We Touch" and "Believe" came out in the 2000s, not the 1990s.
Full covers?
So many things that are so on point in this
Wow!
Super!
Only one word. AWESOME
💟👍
o.o Where are all the comments? I highly request a full cover of Sonique "It Feels So Good"
やっば
You should try to sing some ABBA songs it will sound amazing!
Mitch's pitch
Worst music concept I have ever listened to in my life
Что не нравится 3,5 тысячам? 🧐😱😳
when Kirstie is a literal goddess
If there's anything that can turn me gay, it's Scott's look at 0:15
I need this to be an album with full versions of all these songs
I'm not intended to make vocaloid looks bad, but I think it take a sweet long time until they beat Pentatonix's Acapella skills
명불허전
Why must she get lip fillers??
Holy sh**! Always blown away! 💛✨💛
Hello guys make life 110% happy with the memories of the 90s with these successes. (Restless, Move Your Body, All That  She Wants, A la la la long, Claro De Luna .  Thank you...
Anyway European. But great. That's when I was I was a really young girl! Love ya, guys and girl!
Please please do all of them in full versions. That would be my favourite album ever 🥰🤩
You should have added Backstreet boys in this medley
they should perform this at EDc
I still come back just for Feel So Good and Every time We Touch
Do full version of I’m blue
waiting for full version of "IM BLUE" and other throwback medleys
Arrrrg, it's over, wait Nov. 27 th. lucky people on East coast ! Tickets anyone ?
Omg, I never , wow, very nice.
i am blue dababedabadi
AWESOME !
minha banda favoritaaa🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
good to meet the new bass (I'm such a racist, I couldn't tell him apart from 'the beat-boxer' if I saw them each individually; sure that's not as "racist" as discrimination etc., but ... it's like that "Family Guy" where Peter goes up to every Asian Man saying, "Hey! It's Jackie Chan!")
Really need the full version of "Believe - Cher"
If you can make sonique song fully it will be amazing. It is just give goosebumps ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Love, love, love. With this music I grew up. Thank you guys for this amazing bouquet of art
What an amazing medley, 17 tracks defining 90's nightlife, culture and music. The collaboration is as spectacular as the arrangement.
Careless Whisper Take me to church What a wonderful world
Heaven by DJ SAMMY!!!!
Esta rola deberia estar en todas las plataformas digitales🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏
please come to Dubai Expo 2020
Okay first: Kirstie looks AMAZING here.   Second: the outfit changes were both subtle and very effective. A-Plus (we still need to talk about that mesh top candace)  Third: they sound so so incredible. just perfection. the sound team really let these guys shine here. so impressive...
Wapisimo recordando temasos antiguos, pero podíais aver metido la mítica de chasis "fly on the wings"
And this is my second Fave haha love it XD
Life after love please. Full version
Now a 90s R&B medley please!
We definitely need a full version of "It feels so good"!!! My goodness... They are awesome!!!
I have been a fan for many years every single time they sing It’s unbelievable wow wow wow I don’t have a hat but I take it off to you well done well done and thank you for entertaining us for so many years you guys are number one legends
Thumbs down are all from Osama Bin Laden's offspring...
While I am disappointed to hear auto-tune used--because of all the negative connotations attached to it--I have to admit that this has the most tasteful use of auto-tune I have heard.
World topers voice
Goosebumps...simply goosebumps...especially Sonique and Cascada, later Waiting for Tonight and Cher ... thank you ! Very much !
Full versions of all the songs would be an album I would buy with all my savings
We need Part 2 so many great songs from 90s
PLEASE COME TO PHX!
Wow wow wow!!!!  Awesome 👌  very pretty cool.
❤️❤️❤️
Der Anfang ist gemacht biiiiite mehr davon !
"Mitch, why are dressed as the guy from Scarface? That's an 80s movie, we're doing a 90s medley."  "What's Scarface?"
lindosssssssssss
Esse grupo é sensacional!
Let's just cut to the chase... they should cover everything. Period. Any song ever made is made better by Pentatonix.
I love itttt
I need a full version of everything.
정말 좋아요
We need a cover album with all of these songs!!!!
Me ha petado la cabeza con estos temazos
Masterpiece 🤌🏻
I can’t believe this is beatboxing 🔥🔥
I really can't handle how 80s the 90s feel.
A medley I didn’t know I needed ! Dang 😍

気づいたら泣いてる 言葉の意味は分からないけど歌だけでこんな感動させてくれるの凄い
大好きな歌ばかりで感動して泣いてしまいました 綺麗なハーモニーありがとうございます😭
Technically Cascada is '06 but still epic as always from PTX.
COLOQUEM NO SPOTIFY ESSE MIX! ❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
I love the fact that they use obvious autotune to capture the way these songs were made then
This is the best version of these songs
SCOTT'S HAIR!!! OMG!!! JUST... OMG!!! SO WONDERFUL. Great job though. We all know mitch is SO awesome.
i'm back, please make believe with full song, i'm from Brazil and i love your version, please
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!
Obvs Pentatonix are always great, but this takes me allllll the way back... Outstanding.
あかん！Cascade流れたとき鳥肌たった。  好きすぎる！！！
Whoa the guy that did Cher’s lead voice was fire 🔥
I would be ready for 90's medley 2,3,4,5..... Just saying. Absolutely love it.
Simple unbelievable ❤️❤️❤️
Excellent Medley but by far the best song was BELIEVE, I will never get over it. They should definitely do the full version of that song.
CAN WE PLEASE BRING BACK THIS GENRE PLEASE
Can they put this on Apple Music so that I can listen on repeat?? I’m obsessed!
please come to Dubai Expo
thanks for the nostalgia now i want to download all these songs
Wow! What a powerful medley of 90’s dance anthems ... this could become my personal anthem playlist for changing my life, living authentically, living my truth, going to clubs where I could finally connect with “my” people (and dance like no one was watching), and starting a new career. Love this compilation Pentatonix!
This made me so happy and feel so old at the same time... XD
Super!
wow😲
00s Dance Medley? Please
Didn't know Finn had such a deep voice, keep it up!
Would love to see ptx do a sng with homefree

OMG KIRSTIE SO COOL 🤩🤩🤩
I love these so much, especially since sometimes it clues me into something I missed.  But then sadly sometimes the originals just aren't nearly as good as you, bringing me down again.  Anyway, yet another fantastic offering pulling on those nostalgia strings!
Can someone please list the songs for me. Thanks!
i think i wached it 100 times
Love it!!! 👏🏻👏🏻❤️
This is literally every song they play on the speaker in the shop I work in on repeat 24/7  lol

Ви безмежні.і (це українською) !!!! Ето больше чем русское "безграничгый" . Ваш талант просто райский.
petition for a full version of "Believe"
So you ve got: Discount Drake                          A more athletic James Corden                          The Weeknd AKA The Forehead                          Halle Berry cosplaying as Monika from friends on the episode with the humidity curling up her hair                          And Gunther (Tutti frutti somer love)  I just had to say it I am sorry
LOVE Kristin's hair!!
OMG its Miami Vice
Круто!!!
too much edit in this version, I miss their first videos, much cleaner, much more natural
Description is wrong!  The version of “Every time we Touch” the description refers to (by Cascada) came out in 2006 and is therefore is not a 90s song!  The description should correctly credit Maggie Reilly
I just want to shave Mitch's face!! The stash makes him look like a creeper js
No Whigfield?!  Saturday night?! smh :)
creo soy el único mexicano que los sigue
Lets bring it to 10m!
I would like if it possible the full version of all these songs especially of I'm Blue 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵 and lalalala
It would be nice to have these all individually done...
well this is a whole european party
Black dudes:  "Can we sing too?" Rest: "No.  Beatbox." Black dudes:  "But..." Rest:  "Shut up and to it."
Mais perfeito que isso não há. Minha infância e adolescência todinha em um vídeo.
Is it on Spotify ?
Thank you so much for memory lane
Piel de gallina!!!!
Kevin's beatboxing is just completely unreal. If he ever did a Masterclass on it I'm sure everyone would scramble to join!!!
You are wonderful 🎉 from Russia with big love❤️❤️❤️
Is Ms. Maldonado working on a sleeve? Never have seen tatts on her until this vid
PTX needs to do a 90s dance album!
Nice to hear some Dutch artists! (Alice DJ, Vengaboys)
Wow! 👁👄👁
Love it!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏❤
La da deee la duuu daoooooow. ❤️❤️👀
<3
The only bad thing about this is that it ends. Luckily, you can follow up with the Daft Punk medley for another 5mins of insane quality singing.
Freaking cool!!! One of your best a capellas!!!
How do they do this?!😲
Uau!
But... but... Rick Astley???
I truely disagree with the comments, I keep surfing the net to find a song you sing with your own stamp on it. You guys have lovely voices, but you are so much more than karaoke singers
Best video ♡
imagine disliking though-
This is perfect!!!!!!!! I wish they will do a whole version for every song!
i would love a full version of the "it feels so good" by sonique
Matthew 4:17 - From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. If you have not yet given your heart to Jesus, please I plead with you don't delay for tomorrow is promised to no one.
Bngsaaaaaaaaat. Keren bangettttttt
More, please! Woooow!!!
Make me crazy....I can't wait!!!! Plz let me hear the full version of 'Show me love'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@!@@
If only there was a full version of 'Believe'.
i would benefit from a cover of any of these songs on their own
Things I'd do to Kristin
i thinks whit Avi will be better =)
They are not singing it its lip syncin hahaha
Pentatonix to the world🔥🔥🔥
I don't know why I LOVE their medleys so much!  Maybe because they're so good at arranging.. I guess arranging is the act of splicing everything together and keeping a good tempo?  And yellow is my favorite color, so Scott is my MANS in this one!
Magníficos,  divinos,  incríveis. Amo vocês .
Is this actually pure acapella?? Doesn't sound like it
Amazing 🥂
Pentatonix, stop teasing me ;-;. Just make an album of these songs already...
Muito top
but why do i want a eurobeat remix of this
Why is this one not on Spotify?! HOW DARE YOU!
Like seriously you guys are amazing
❤️
Wau 💥 💣 👍 🍹.        🇨🇿
Why am I watching this gem of a video only today??? Love the outfits and all of you, of course! 🥰
Show ruili God😎😎😎😎😎
Sois lo mejor únicos de toda la faz de la tierra
Everytime we touch💓💓
Every single time you guys sing you improve and impress, I don’t even understand how ! Amazing 🤩
Had so much fun dancing to this!  Also loved Kristin's hair!
The serotonin and cortisol really levels out here
Thank you very much for this compilation, I enjoyed a lot! By the way, in this video all you 5 look great, fancy and sexy!
Stoped watching pentatonix cause of Scott, i was a huge fan before. Dude why do you have to moan with every sound you make? Its not good.
*One guy looks a bit like Jimmy Fallon with beard*
It’s still sad that one left and another joined they are a perfect team tho.
Awesome!!!!!
There is no way I can like this video enough!!! Amazing!!! Can't wait for the next medley!
I would love for them to do a spooky themed Medley for the month on October 🎃👻🍬
They never cease 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 another A+
Ficou Maravilhoso cantada por vc. Parabéns. Amei❤❤❤❤❤
I still can’t get over the fact that they didn’t include Vogue by Madonna or any of the other relevant songs of the 90s she has! I know it’s a 90’s dance medley but she has some good dance songs that could have been included on this video
Bring out this cover album! 😍😍😍😍
I needed a little This is the Rhythm of the Night but this is SO GOOD!!!!!
That.        Was.     BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we please see fulls!!!!!!!!
Kocham Was !!!
I want this track to be on Spotify so I can hear this on the way to work or wherever I go. :D
wait why are they all wearing two different outfits throughout the video?
Born in 85, so these songs are my childhood and teen years. I am smiling like an idiot!!!
2 songs that i want to be full version: - Everytime we touch - Cascade - Believe - Cher  Hope it would come true. 🙏
This sounds awesome
You need to make an album with these songs.
Como alguém pode não gostar???? Eles arrasam de mais 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This but only Cascada
cascada is 2006 guys möööööp
I cant spend more than a few days now without hearing your songs.
Son unos genios!!!
so many good feelings, absolutely love you guys
My teenage years all in this remix, all songs I listened too.  40 now so this is awesome. Love it. Thanks penatonix for making me smile. Positive vibes. xox Blessings to you all.
Wow!!! don't know who edit this video..but thats crazy nice!!
PENTATONIX IS JUST SO AWESOME!!!!!
YAAASSS GYPSY WOMAN!!!!
I enjoyed that a little too much :)
Good remix
Spectaculair!!
Офигеть... Помню каждую песню из этого видео... Спасибо. Лайк однозначно.
Every time we touch is in the 2000's
😍😍😍😍
Alguien me podria decir el nombre de todas la canciones porfavor?
This brings me back to watching all the NOW commercials 😄 🤣
What happened to Mitch Grassi's nose ? Looks like he received a punch on it ?
FULL COVER OF BELIEVE!!!! We need this.
Ñ
This... Right here... #GetsMeInTheFeels #MakesMeEmotional 🎭
The Beatbox!!! Wow!!
Genialni sa, Einfach geil
I so want ALL OF THIS ONE FULL VERSION !!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT !!!
Cascada isn’t 90’s. It’s early 2000 (2005 to be specific)
Legit thought they got Toni Braxton to sing with em lol
The clothes game is on fire. That drip y'all.
I loved  when  they  turned  blue  and  the  beat  when it was  almost  over
Please, make for every Song a Full Song Mix. This ist Amazing!! And a Medley of 80 or 00 Songs!! You are such good.
You all totally rock every single song you do! My oldest son Bryan Poole was an big fan and he got me hooked on your music. Bryan passed away in 2018 after a terrible wreck. He lived 6 weeks after the wreck but died of a blood clot. It was devastating and I have been in grief counseling ever since. I am hoping that one day you guys could cover “I Can Only Imagine” by Mercy Me. Bryan used to sing that in church and it is now his song, but I know he would have loved to here you do that song. Great job guys.
like asking you to record all these complete songs, just a part of each one just makes you want to know what they would be like in this work of art that you make. I never asked for anything, but please do.
Fabulous!! Of course ☺💓
Someone needs to bring back "Unchained Melody" from the 60's.  Would LOVE to see you guys do it.
Первый состав намного лучше. Увы.
Nice song ~~ 😊🎵
4:30 kept replaying this part
This hits different now that I can understand English.
Me encanto 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
I love how everyone comes across as gay  , straight ,  Bi ,  fabulous and fierce at once. 😂👌
Cracks !!!!!!!
Please go on AGT!
You’re on fire guys🔥
I want "do you believe" full version
Was this fun, or what!
The best ever😍
please pentatonix...cover full version all of these!!!
Love it and love ptx music! 🎧🎶
please do disney medley ❤❤❤
They finally did Believe.
never ending creativity you have all, looovvee it, i keep smiling everytime play this video
This was freakin awesome, I wish there were more. Please consider doing another 90s dance medley.
Remember on The Sing Off when they tried the Cher song and said they couldn’t do it…Well they Nailed it this time around!!! ❤️‍🔥
I miss 2014's Mich.
Vcs são incríveis 😍
Uau 😍♥️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGa39UtYVo
When Kirstin sings “do you think you’re better off alone” IT SOUNDS SO LIKE cosmic or soemthing it’s so freaking cool
takes me WAY BACK i love pentatonix since i was in high school.. now an adult and still digging their song
nostalgia Beautiful
Someone find this medley on Spotify?
Espectaculares ❤️❤️❤️
Me at 4:00: DISCO DISCO BOOM BOOM! Hahahahaha
90s kids don't react challenge...PTX Edition. *I failed miserably* xD
I am so sorry and really don't mean any disrespect but Kevin is so beautiful and you guys are amazing love you
What a lovely reminder of PTX's talent & magic ❤️‍🔥 It was so interesting to see which songs pulled at my heartstrings the most. When I heard the lyrics "your loving feels so good..." & later on "waiting for tonight..."  Whew, the nostalgia just swept over me!
Essa turma é muito fera!! Top
Vi amooo❤❤❤
I enjoy this medley sooo much. All the songs are the ones  I used to get down to in the clubs. Brings back such awesome memories! Thank you guys. I'm forever devoted.
Pessoal qual é o nome da música 1:57 até 2:12.?
Wait when did they get a full lineup change? I only recognize one member.
Petition for a full version of Blue (Da ba Dee) - holy crap that was good.
vous venez quand en france
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great, but.  I totally thought these dance tracks were EU centric.
I really miss the Vengaboys... They made such great, light, enjoyable music!
Our entire world has changed and your music has lifted many of us up.   I know 2121 is not looking good but please have some outdoor stadium concerts in the States. Knoxville TN has a stadium that holds over 100,,000 people. We could fill it. I don’t think you realize how much your music has helped a lot of us these past two years. You are truly a gift
This has me wanting for this to be a preview of your next album, with full versions! Or videos, but I would love to hear you cover the whole songs :)
A full version of each of these songs please Pentatonix
PTX you guys ( and gal ) make me so happy every time I hear your songs ! Each of you have such fantastic vocals ! Hola from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 ! Friday September 10th 2021 12:25am ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️🌺🌺🌺🌸🌸🌸🌹🌹🌹🌷🌷🌷🥰🥰🥰😊😊😊

OK, when did Scott develop the Superman "dropped forehead curl?"  His hair is usually rigorously swept back! :D  Looks fabulous. :)
I just found this video today and have watched it like 3-4 times already. The music and the video are so satisfying.
3:11 I don,t know why but for whatever reason, I will randomly think of this and it always draws me back to this song.
You guys make me melt♥️♥️♥️♥️
She is sensuous Beauty dripping into an Angelic Voice independent from all
Love it! 😃
The nostalgia 😭
3:20 Oh my god .
We definitely need a full version of "Everytime we touch" !

A 5 min throwback to my childhood. Love it!
Привет, ребята! В очередной раз констатирую факт того, какие же вы умнички! :) С удовольствием погрузился в музыку 90-х. Результат - хорошее настроение, благодаря вашему талантливому исполнению! :) Спасибо большое! Дальнейшего вам процветания! PS. Вы все здорово перевоплощаетесь - можете быть такими разными - так здорово. :) И снова хочу отметить вашу девочку. Улыбка - просто лучезарная! :)

Okay it's no secret we all know Cher used auto-tune so I'm very happy that they kept it in here when they were singing her song
Still that 5:04 *voom* is the best noise on the planet.
Would loved to see you do Led Zeppelin cover :)
We need more videos like this. Amazing!!!!
Why are they soooo good?! TF?! Like the harmonizing and all. What?!!!! I particularly like "around the world" and "every time we touch"
please make a full cover of i'm blue :D
I wonder which one they enjoyed doing the most ?? Fascinating.
신나네요^^ 잘들었습니다
Amazing
0:37 /stands up for the national anthem/
90s in a nutshell
Brasil on 2021
I have to visit here every day.
I was born 1981 in 1986 I was 6 years old 1990  in elementary school  I was - 10 years old to 19 years old high school when  these songs came out good choice in music  man I am 40 now and feel old where did my time go for me lol 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻excellent job .
Thanks PTX for doing a 90s dance medley! Here in Philippines, we say "Batang 90s" if you grow up with the music during 90s. I love all these 90s dance hits! Great medley Pentatonix! Just can't help stomp my feet, nod my head and dance to the music.
Wow. Flashbacks man ... the lights ... the beats ... thank you!
Everything is art. The blend is just- right.. i couldn't stop replaying this.
Damn I'm old...
90s really are best years...
ty< for the menories ptx! man tears were shed
Everytime we touch was 2005 lol. Did they mean 90's and oughts mix? haha
Sorry to butt in but HOW the heck they make their living?? I mean it take time and pratice to do this music video.
What I need a full cover of it feels so good, first time I heard this medley I DIED when that came on
njir ada cinta satu malam
do a show love me alone, very good
I grew up jamming to all these songs lol!!!
Are there full versions of these covers by Pentatonix~?
Oh my gosh, y'all killed it and every song just made me happier and gave me all the best vibes. Y'all are just so awesome!!!!
Love!  Your individual and combined talents mind blowing!  Love closing my eyes and focusing on beautiful sounds you are able to produce.
Cantão bem demais 😍🎶👏👏
I was born in the 2000’s and know all of these songs
Mitch looks so cool with a mustache, btw.
Love Kristen's voice so much
Does anyone know when this will be on iTunes? I need this!
아...너무  너무 굿~~^^  작업실  주소 남겨주세요...한국 소주 한다발 선물로 보내드릴테니..서로 힘든시기 코로나 시기 지나고 한국오시면 연락하세요...2박3일..소주에 삼겹살 살게요~~^^ 인종을 떠난 음악적인  하모니..너무 좋아요,..이런거 배워야 되는 놈들 많음....우린 그저 서로 인정하며 하모니를 이루며  잘지내고 싶은데..
아..
I love this now 80s songs jeje
💙💙
Wow, there voices sounds great
Can’t believe it’s all their own voice. Better than the originals. 90’s music brings nostalgia.
The black and blue jacket guy is soo hottt
"Everytime We Touch" came and I LOST MY FUCKING MIND
I need a Believe full version
I know Cher uses a pitch corrector on that vocal, but one of the things I LOVE about you guys is that you don't need them!  It just hurts when you use that awful thing!!
Потрясающее  живое звучание!!! Super!!!😀😇😀
Все такие позитивные. Я в восторге!
afffff sensacionallllllllllllllll
Didn’t even realize waiting for tonight came out in ‘99 like WHAT?! I’m that old 😂
Кайф😍
어머나😍 다 아는 노래들 옛날생각나요👍👍👍😍😍
What a trip ✊✊✊
Missing Avi Kaplan
Crazy~ ^^
Gracias ATEEZ por hacerme conocer a estos manes que cantan tuquísimo /^-^/
Woow cantan espetaculaaaaaaaaaar!!
Aquí luego de ver su colaboración con ATEEZ ^^
this honestly deserves a grammy
So good!
Happy wann immer ich Pentatonix höre! Möchte noch mal tanzen können, wie in meiner Zeit ohne Rollstuhl!!!!  Sehnsucht......
Best of the best~~~^@^~🔥😎🤠😎🔥
Wow that's perfect👏👏👏👏
They fucking cheated. Everytime We Touch from 90s wasn't dance song...
The best of all time
와ㅜㅜ너무 잘부르시는듯ㅜㅜ진짜 음색이 너무 다들 넘 좋아요ㅡ♡귀힐링하고갑니다
Perfect 👌 Superb 👌 Beautiful 😊
wow... great!! super, super cool! love so much, thank you!
<3
Is so perfect...
OMG... Perfect... Congratiletion
4:27 killed me 😄💚
Sooooo good 👏
QUE PERFEIÇÃO, MARAVILHOSO
👍
the video was almost 4mn already and I'm like about that one from Cheoooooooh😅
Wow this is LIT! Great stuff, guys! <3
I feel oldddd♡
My childhood  in so many songs❤❤❤❤🤗🤗😍
They're really amazing!! I love it!
Twas soo good, smiled the whole video 💚
Bravissimi
0:55 who?
siempre sorprenden gratamente. Felicitaciones!
After 10 or so years, they were finally able to sing Cher's Believe 👏
You are the Champions!!!!
YES
The best part is 4:30 "Believe (Cher)" .. PLEASE MAKE THE HOLE SONG!! Congrats!
Ah Scott killed it on Show Me Love! I desperately want the full song.
Los vengo escuchando y ya me tienen a sus pies.🛐
so good now pentatonix you so my happy love you
she was a beauty, such a pity....selling yourself for marketing...
Do it generic. We are not stupid :D
Now we need a naughties medley!. 🎙🎶🎵🎼
No Ray of Light???
Amo mais do que chocolate.
I LOVE THIS MEDDLEY SO MUCH!!!!! Your voices fits perfect and sound so good!!!!
wow!!.. ❤️Missing avi kaplan's voice a bit though :D
Los estoy staneando después de ver su colaboración con ATEEZ. PENTATONIX son geniales :)
This lighting is AMAZING!
I want to be part when will you sign me??🤥😥
Wow. Amazing!
first time PTX used auto-tune ? 😅 @4:01 "believe"
This was so dope
I'm a fan of ATEEZ and seeing this kind of group, it makes me so warm and I really love the songs they uploaded, you know this kind of songs is what I want to hear!! It's a GOOD one! I'm very lucky meeting ATEEZ and PENTATONIX ❤️❤️ BOTH of them has a GOOD songs!  No offense but this kind of group with that kind of songs, you know no swear/ cursed words....... is  truly deserves to be heared by one of us, it makes us feel better ,❤️❤️
I have disco tingles all over....
This is my first watch of a pentatonix video in years and I’m conflicted. You guys choose such a hard genre. 90s dance pop was very ethereal and dreamy. I think you guys were a bit too limited by your numbers this time around.
Singers,  actors, love them!
I love how they all look so happy when they start singing "Beautiful Life" <3
I hear all songs that I used to dance to.
The same 90s famous songs here in Brazil 😍😍😍
This.was.EPIC!!!
Omg esto es fenomenal me encanta......
More please!
PETITION FOR PENTATONIX " FOLLOW YOU BY IMAGINE DRAGONS =)"
Damn! Loved this medley! Loved the Daft Punk medley style
its a pity we cant put here multiple thumbs up! this is really outstanding!
Guys, You are something !!! :) this is amazing!!!
AMAZING!!!! Loved every second of it!
excellent
This is DDR music done right! I’d KILL for a pentatonix version of DDR
💗
so awesome
Just imagine an ABBA Evolution haha
These guys can transform cheesiest pop tune into a classical smash!
😍
Not even a Coco Jamboo?
I wish they would do a full version of Believe, the way they sing it, is so epic.
Id like to see an 80s one
some of these are early 2000's but I've learned that early 2000s and late 90s kind of socially and collectively blur
Thank you guys it was such a nostalgic ride indeed
Woooow🔥👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Absolutely awesome
Such beautiful people and beautiful voices!
Petition for this to be a teaser for an entire album featuring these songs!!!!
え、最高？ Awesome!!
La da da dee da da da da La da da dee da da da da Oh yeah, wanna be my lover Oh yeah, wanna be my...   What is love? Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me No more Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh   Dum dum dum dum... La la la la la, it's all around the world Just la la la la la, and everybody's singing   Do you think you're better off alone? Do you think you're better off alone?   Everybody dance now Give me the music Everybody dance now   Rhythm is a dancer It's a soul's companion You can feel it everywhere Lift your hands and voices Free your mind and join us You can feel it in the air   Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room Let's spend the night together From now until forever Boom boom boom boom I wanna go boom boom Let's spend the night together Together in my room   Your love, it feels so good And that's what takes me high Higher than I've been before It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh-oh, baby   I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive  'Cuz everytime we touch I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can't you feel my heart beat fast I want this to last Need you by my side   I'm blue Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di   Deep inside Deep deep down inside   You've got to show me love, oh Heartbreaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving my love And getting nowhere, nowhere   Waiting for tonight, oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight   It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh   No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  Do you believe in life after love? (Life after love) I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now   La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da   Finally you've come along The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong If you only knew the way I feel about you I just can't describe it, oh no no  Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it Finally it has happened to me, right in front of my face and I just can not hide it Finally
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Is there a way to have this song playable on other platforms (I.e. Amazon music or iTunes purchase) or is it a huge copyright thing?
I feel 27 when I listen to this because I don't recognize most of these songs LOL.
Whats the song name that came in at 4:45 ??
KIRSTIN SOUNDS SO GOOD IN EVERYTIME WE TOUCH
0:53 😍😍😍😍😍😍.
I enjoyed it so much~ so nostalgic 🤧
Sensacional eu amei 😍💖

DOOPEEEE😭😭✨

I LOVE U
Mitch Nailed Those high notes on Everybody dance now!
the “everytime we touch” cascada version they did is from 2006, not a 90’s song.
Cher - believe 😍 full version please 😁
Excellent😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
petition for ptx to sing the full version of boom boom boom boom
Can we have a full version of ALL of these!?!?!?! Reliving my youth!
Kirstie I really love your 90s hairstyle and makeup 😍😍😍😍😍😍
What in the "Now That's What I Call Music" did I just watch?! I NEED MORE!!!
They blow my mind  every time.  AMAZING..Pentaholic and proud..😎
😍
Polska dotarła?
All these songs remind me of my childhood. Cannot believe that I’ve aged so much - but there is nothing better than have PTX remind me in their inimitable style that music is forever and their unbridled talent knows no bounds! Thank you guys for taking me through memory lane!
16 tons next maybe?
💛💛💛🌼🌼🌼🌼
Please do an 80s medley
This is better than *any* 90's mashup, hands down
I freaking love this medley  😍😍🎶🎼🎤 can you awesome people please keep these coming
Thank you !!!
mixing song was a good idea!!!
Queremos mais...muitos mais!!!!
Amo sera que e só eu?😍😎
Why this thing to fill lips with botox? I don't understand why most beaufitul female are ruining themselfs with this thing!!
Ok everyone!!! Petition for a 70's and 80's version😁🤘
2:40 cinta satu malam
Increíblemente talentosos
Last song: Finally Filipinos: *remembers that one Ariel advertisement*
Nice 👍
But Autotune tho?....Why it would sound better without it and I thought the whole point was to do everything via voice?....Now how will we know when its their voice or autotuned?
Hmmm
00:36 does anyone know the name of this noise?
Mitch : look like he tired. Scott : feeling himself YASSSS. Kevin: just being himself.  Matt : tired
OMG Autotune on Believe - faithful to the source!   PTX is FIRE
И все-таки Ави не хватает(
HOW have they just gotten BETTER AND BETTER??!!!!!?!
Eles são toppppp
I'm so glad to hear Sonique here:)
Love you guys 😘

Awesome PENTATONIX!! I love "It Feels So Good", "Waiting for Tonight", "Believe" Especially, the song “Everytime We Touch” and "Believe" I love it!!  Can you do a full version of the above-mentioned songs?  It's really beautiful when you sing it!! 😍💕😍
Gawd! Ya'all should be declared national heroes! *bow*

Holy hell that was good. Absolutely vintage ptx. Idk why, but I haven't listened to them in literally years. Clearly that was a grave mistake.

Man alive! This group is fantastic! What incredible harmony and arrangements! Wow!

Fantastic, back in the past . Thanks
Kirstin was and will ever be my crush forever...look at this women!!!

Amazing
🔷🔷🔷🔷🔷
Oh my Gosh, so much Memories...awesome :-)
Ok but what about a disco medley?
😍😍😍😍🥰
It has been an honour to follow you all the last 10 years. Watching you all grow into the incredible group you are today.   Thank you for the medley! Born 97’ and this was a welcome wave of nostalgia ❤️🤍
2021🥰💕
2:15 Oh wow, great voice. Pity they could never do the techno part of the song though. 2:42 holy crap, they actually did it, and its awesome!
They need to put a full album of 90s music. Hell... Everything ever released needs their touch.
Remake "Evolution of Music"
Absolutely horrific. Just because you can sing, doesn’t mean you should
I really want the full version of "Everytime We Touch"
i need a full version of “Everytime we touch”…
大好きなアーティストです！ これからも聴き続けます！！
2021 lol I love this
What happened to Avi Kaplan and I thought it was supposed to be hexatonix? Haven’t made it to hepta yet eh..??
I watch this video way too much.  Never get tired of it.  :)
Stink about the auto tune.
full versions please...
Cher 😍
Los amo ..me encantan sus versiones son lo máximo necesito versión completa de todas estas canciones 🙏🥺
I still love you guys ♥️
I swear Mitch was born for 90s music. He is made for this 🔥🔥🔥
Era de mis tiempos 😃
We need a full version of Everytime We Touch and I’m Blue
Wow!
No sabia q mbappe cantaba tan bien
Epic!
I want a full version of everything covered in this amazing mashup.
Matt's bass tho😀esp on the Venga boys and the Cascada. And his Cher😍
Господи, ну какая же ностальгия то!!! Люблю Вас ребята!!! Спасибо за Ваше творчество!
Bahhhh cagou na cabeça essa música 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 apoio mais música
They are so talented
When Beautiful life came on I was like GO OFF MATT
Even though Everytime We Touch isn't from the 90s, I can forgive it since this shows the evolution of dance music itself. This was definitely ear-candy for me and can't wait to hear more!
When did Corden join the group? 🤣
What about Shaggy?
You all of you should pick something that means something meting to u And do a Broadway Thing Do yo have any original music I love You 🦋
Вы потерялись! Неужели тот кто ушел задавал ту неповторимость. Это механический апельсин(
Please the wife of Scott please never Turn me to the police or authorize me. Please I’m begging you both
I love the Pentatonix. Transcendentalism through music.
何回も聞いちゃうほんとにカッコイイ✨✨✨
I need a full album… this is just such a tease!!!
This is awesomeeeeee
i didn't know 90s was so gay
I really want full versions of all the songs
AUTOTUNE ALERT!!!!!!!!! tan bien que sonaban antes... u.u
When will be added to Spotify?? I love this mix!
🤯
It's so refreshing!
Imagine the full version of every one of these songs on an album.  It would be so fun.
So awesome!
My 67 year-old uncle has a huge crush on Kirstin! Big thanks to him too because he introduced PENTATONIX to me, with their Daft Punk MV. We are big fans of you guys!
Cada vez que los escucho, más me gustan. Excelentes voces. Chicos son geniales
Please a full version of Cascada!
Success is a funny thing, the more successful and popular you become the more ridiculous you can look and get away with it. No limits.
A 2000s dance music would have some club bangers
All of the jams were there I was feeling blue too
I wish there was a "love it" button for whatever Pentatonix makes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We lost one of pentatonix
AMAZING.....a bit off topic but I would love to hear you guys do Pompeii by Bastille
Great job, really!!!
👌🤩🤩🤩🤩
such a music FORCE!
I loved the best song 😍❤️
Better of alone ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I just relived high school in 6 minutes.
Make each song a single, plz!!!
Every time I hear this melody I remember  clubbing with my friends. Especially the night before Thanksgiving one year. My grandmother was wondering why I was so sleepy. My Mom was she was out at a club all night. My grandmother was well did you dance with any cute guys? I was yes... My Mom was it was a gay club complete with drag show. My grandmother blinked and then was well did you have fun? I was yes and then told her what happened.  The rest of my somewhat conservative extended family was quiet for most of the dinner. Best Thanksgiving ever! 😂
https://youtu.be/YdwG5OEhvDI
Amazing voices and beautiful people!
Cascada is technically not 90s but early 2000s though. ;)
The 90's was awesome!
Mitch is extremely sexy in this video, I can't
I want a full version of Blue.
Sonique's it feels so good is fire for me
Full version for I’m blue
1:17 🤯😍😍 so cleannnnnn
amazing video love your music you guys are amazing sweet talented  singers you guys have amazing voices   me and my mom love listening to your music so much 😊
Likes video after first song ❤️❤️❤️
Great as always. But they don't need sound effects over their brilliant voices (Cher song). They sound so much better than the original 😉
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVERRR!!! JUMPING AND DANCING IN MY APARTMENT I LOVEEEE IT OMFG
Huge PTX fan, however I can’t get over the bad mixing in a couple of these. Their voices sounded electronic and awful. Note, I didn’t say that the whole thing sounded awful just the bad mixing parts.
this is proof that i do not have the superior way of saying the word deep
Not sure i feel old. Or young again 😅
🎧🎧🎧🎧🎶🎶🎶
😍
聞き終わってから、ん？あれ？あ！これアカペラか！やば！！ってなる
Y'all have come a long way since the Sing Off. Of course you were killing it back then too.
Do a Chrisitna Aguilera one please
Mitch is giving me total Freddie Mercury vibes an HR I am HERE for it
Better off alone definitely needs a full version
Шедевр
Siempre q los escucho me gusta más! Sigan siendo Excelentes!
Just great!😍 listen and dance while the baby is asleep😎💃
That last song is amazing! I need the full version!
Wish I could meet and be tough by them to improve myself before I start my videos
My favourite group and artist at the moment would love to see some 80s colabs aswell this group beats most artists of today the perfect harmony and melodies
Love it! Fantastic!
I keep coming back to this video for Matt. Like, the whole group is and has always been just too darn amazing, there's just something about Matt's energy that's just *chef's kiss* He looks like he's genuinely having so much fun and I love to see it!
can you do arashi remix?
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8gQ5hs1_8uIdcvWg-JyMuw/?sub_confirmation=1
Awesome
I absolutely love this!!! And, surprisingly, I recognized six of these songs, and I had always thought that they came out after I was born. I guess some things are timeless lol
2:59 dr disrespect... will you no longer broadcast your games? XD
sCan you imagine a world without music? How would you feel about it? What would you miss the most?  Te imaginas un mundo sin música? Como te sentirias? Que seria lo que mas extrañarias?
Amei maravilhoso 😍
Lol. Reminds me of how much time I spent in listening to non-stop club music with a non skid cd Walkman while doing menial chores like vacuuming, laundry, or carwash. 🤣
Me encanta. Gracias!!! Un deleite. Patricia desde Argentina
Awesome vocal performances, special like for Kirstin Maldonado singing the lead of Rhythm Is a Dancer at 1:22
Was waiting for Rhythm of the Night
What happened to the dude with the deep voice?
90’s music 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Wait since when did they start using a synth?
Fantastic! !!!!!!
Man I’m sorry. I just don’t find kirstens new look attractive. ( might get hate, sorry for speaking my mind )
I'm thinking this is 100% a cappella?? (Like the movie "Pitch Perfect") Does anyone know if that's correct?? 😲 FYI it definitely hits different through head phones/ear buds 😀 😲 ❤
Essa moça faz lembrar a Anitta  * w *
That them? Really wow on sesame street they were pretty diffrent5
Thank You , it takes me Back Far awayyy Fro COVID19 , BYE BYE CORONAA , IM.GOING BACK
OMG, this is so amazing
If I didn't have to shave I would be happy. Hard for me to understand why a girl would want to deal with a mustache
а менять еврея на чёрного - это расизм или обратный расизм?
Enormissime j'adore ce groupe 😍😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕👍👍👍👍👍
What’s amazing, is that I am the only male in my A Cappella choir who can hit above average notes for a tenor.
Also can we talk about the gorgeous tone and reach of Mitch's voice please?  <3
80s/90s kid here, and so this is perhaps the greatest thing I've listened to all week.  Amazing!
it's spectacular knowing that they can hit everything without autotune and the autotune is actually just for style, just like it was in the 2000s and early '10s
idk if anyone ever thinks about this, but seeing the editing change over time into smoother and smoother edits is soooooooooo fucking good. 🔥🔥🤩
❤️❤️
Can you also do a cover for Dragostea Din Tei by O-Zone?? It will be amazing.
Damn that was something :) Great choice of songs, great execution!
I loved this!!! But where is the other bass guy? He was awesome!
who else is wondering which boy is dating the girl?
boom boom boom full version pls
reasons for the thumb downs.....1.....2......3.......?
Man I miss the 90s... 😂
Awesome
Robin s was awesome
Que showww, adorei.
Niesamowite !!!! Po prostu piękne
I love listening to You!
You need to do a full version to it feels so good by sonique that mini snippet isn't enough it was just too good 🤞🏽😭
OMG! This is amazing.  I agree with having a whole album with each of these songs.  Please guys do it!  :)
kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!! Cascada <3
You're the best
CASCADA version they have do or better still all cascada songs like this 😀
Son buenos.
the singing at 2:00 was perfection
this gives me flash backs to their daft punk vid 😩
😢😍😢😱😢
I need a whole cd of full versions of these songs
Gypsy woman needs a full version.
dear pentatonix my loves how about releasing '90s medley Album' with all the full version of these songs!!
use your headphone 1:29
Matt's bass is just EVERYTHING! Wow!
Missing Avi :((
If the title of the next album isnt "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL PENTATONIX"...  My 90s life is a lie.
Please make all 90s Songs full Version in an Album.  :)
Hi Love ❤️  Beautiful Harmonies💫 How about a medley  Of Grease? Or Abba? 🎩
Take the songs from global pop group Now United and mix it up please 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I'd like this as an album. Many thanks
all these songs remind me of my beautiful youth... I miss that time! thanks for that Pentatonix.
Wow! Lindo demais! 😍
I listen to this 10x a day :D its so good!!
Oh my god!!😍

I WISH FOR A PENTATONIX AND AVI KAPLAN COLLAB...PLEASE!!
This band gets weirder and weirder ! To much woke nest.
Cascada is  2000s but the original version of that song came out in the 90s.
Awesome
SON GENIALES.!!!!😍
I just cant NOT see Adam Conover in yellow....
A request for a cover of 'Wellerman'?
we need it! 💗
Talent at its peak
I love yours talents, yours voices, from Heaven to People, best vishes from Poland...
love this so much
I'm still sad that Avi left, but I'm not sure about the new guy, it's hard to hear him sometimes.
Was i meant to be born in the 90s?.....oh wait a second. I was 🤪
You guys don't know how many times I've listened to this.
как всегда невероятно
https://youtu.be/j5Lx9ChfDK0
HA, take that Gen Z LOL
Nice  song  amazing
Yep…I am disappointed… the satanic hand signals are there. They waited to do In the second half, but this band sold out literally.  Ephesians 6 is real, this world is Biblical. Turn to Jesus, everyone. John 3v16, Psalm 25. Call on the name of Jesus to be saved.
The first time I heard this mix I couldn't stop listening to it, AWESOME JOB PENTATONIX!!!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💗💗💜💜💜💜💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗💜💗
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
We need a full 90’s cover album
We totally need full versions of all these songs omg
I love this! These are all the songs that turned a confused teenager into the fabulous gender-fluid 41 yr old I am today!
Maravilhoso 😍😍😍
scott is just dripping sass in this video and i LOVE it lol
Amazing ❤️ 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
Matt does an amazing job on this.  I can't keep up!
Thanks for the journey through my teenage years 😘
I’ve come to the Pentatonix party late but I am loving their works. 🥰🥰🥰
Caramba não dá que talento kkk mandam muito bem 💥
My name is John.  I am a Pentatonix-holic!  I am not ashamed.  I love this video!
I was born in the 2000's and I hate 90's music but I LOVE THIS!!!
Ok but why does ,,Believe” sound so much like the original?
Sois fabulosos!!! 🥰🥰
brings back memories. I love the 90s. well done :)
My ears are thankful for you guys 😍😍🔥🔥 (I keep coming back to this video whenever I feel down)
Can the dude, Mitch, with the creepy thin black mustache just stop that look. Yikes
Please do char do you believe in life please
Show
Люблю вас !!!!
Вот и они стареют.
How they can just put a whole generation summed up in 5 min xD
This video premiered on my birthday, April 9th. In 3 months it's been viewed over 7.5 million times! That has to be a record! I don't really like many 90's dance songs, except Cher, naturally. But I Love this video!! Thanks for a wonderful birthday present Pentatonix, Love you Guys!!
this is so fun to listen to!!!
I need a full version of "Believe". It's SO GOOD.
What a good decade the 90s, I didn't want this video to end!! Great job guys, as always <3 <3
Toooop
mitch <3
Would still be awesome of you could make an complete album with this songs and some other 90's Dance Tracks 😍😍😍😍
Pentatonix - 90s Dance Medley (full lyrics)   "La da da dee da da da da La da da dee da da da da A ha ye heyee, wanna be my lover A ha ye heyee, wanna be my  What is love? Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me No more Oh whoa whoa whoooa, oh Whoa whooa oh, oh Ooooh  La la la la la, it's all around the world Just la la la la la And everybody singing  Do you think you're better off alone? Do you think you're better off alone?  Everybody dance now Give me the music Everybody dance now  Rhythm is a dancer It's a soul's companion You can feel it everywhere (e-very-where) Lift your hands and voices Free your mind and join us You can feel it in the air  Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room Let's spend the night together From now until forever Boom boom boom boom I wanna go boom boom Let's spend the night together Together in my room  Your love, it feels so good And that's what takes me high Higher than I've been before It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh-oh, baby  I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive 'Cuz everytime we touch, I get this feeling, And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly, Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last, Need you by my side  I'm blue Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di  Deep inside Deep deep down inside  You've got to show me love Heartbreaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving my love And getting nowhere, nowhere  Waiting for tonight, oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight  It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one Do you believe in life after love? (life after love) I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no  La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da La da dee la dee da  Finally you've come along The way I feel about you, It just can't be wrong If you only knew the way I feel about you I just can't describe it Ohh no no Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face and I just can not hide it  Finally!"
DANGGGGGG THIS MUSIC HITS DIFFERENT!!!!!

Your amazing! 👏 ❤Can u please do a medley of the temptations?
They never disappoint
사랑합니다. 7년전부터 사랑하는 사람 생길떼마다 팬타트로닉스 영상을 보여주곤 했었습니다.
Wow its so amazing, brings back memories
I've listened to this way too much already... 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
OOF can't get enough of this!
OMG PTX you don't know how much I miss your EDM stuff. This arrangement is 🔥🔥🔥 and 'Believe' needs a full version
WHY ARE WE ALL NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING WHERE SCOTT'S SWEET SHADES ARE FROM?
Man that's great, I was jammin' to these songs in my workout list a couple days ago, and haven't checked on ptx in a while. This is lovely
We need the full versions of those ! I'm buying the album for sure ! :)
Que talento.
This was soul affirming… felt more listening to this assortment then I have at my last dozen church services combined
please part 2
This should be getting way more views
Deberían sacar la canción da blu da blu di da blu dae pero en separado
All these songs bring back memories. I miss my youth.
4:45
Dear Pentatonix, can you place this medley on Spotify?
You’re doing an 80’s dance melody right?
Love love
0:20 missed an opportunity for the "synchronized head bob" from Night at the Roxbury.
OFFICIALLY PETITIONING for:  "It feels so good" by Sonique  cause that little Drum & Bass remix they had goin there was absolutely PHENOMENAL
Руки вверх!!! Алалала) Не ожидал.
Tony Montana 2021
Y’all should consider an ultimate Cher medley.    The potential 😍😍😍
Sehr geil!::::::
deym that believe part was on fire
I think l returned to the ninties, two thousand years, when teenagers hang out the bed of idols on the wall. Wash l'm a fan of you.
Listening ptx after two years!  And this is too way good!  Such a mood changer!
Ai só queria que eles cantassem "What is love" só ela... Porque esse vídeo tá perfeito😍
They are using autotune here? 4:17
I am banned bcause I PRFUNDO
Finally,for a year of searching this channel. I finally found it 😍
i’m surprised they didn’t also do rhythm of the night  but also YES FOR ADDING THE AUTOTUNE ON BELIEVE
Matt’s bass at boom boom boom boom sounds so cool and very much like the original, how did he do it?
Tough
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
just take a minute of silence to watch em rock "try not to vibe with it"
This is Local Vocal theme
You guys legit show your full potential with dance songs!! Mind blown. Please do another dance song medley!
Killian mbappe a retrouver sa reconversion 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Sonique it feels so good was the absolute cherry on top for me
I’m actually in tears hahaha I wouldn’t have thought any of you would have known half of these songs. Every single one is a belter and I’m not even close to coping x
90s Kids - You’re old now edition, featuring pentatonix.   I feel old
Love you guys
Excellent!!! Kisses from Peru
SO GOOOOD!🔥🥰
I NEEED a rythm is a dancer full version
For those who hate this, y’all better leave a comment here. I DARE YA!!
Would love to see a sister act medley 😁
IS THIS GAY CULTURE
Estou viciada
Amazing!!!!!!
Wow! 😥🔥🙌
this is like Gta V PoP Radio
Everytime we touch was released in 2006 though?
I lived this song. (not a typo)
I need full versions of these songs!! Funny I downloaded these songs just last week lol.
Love this ❤️❤️❤️
the blond one looks like a sweedish model that I want to keep in my bed xD actually I pretty much want the entire band xD That hotness and talent ?!
Think also of making a medley of Boyziimen best songs pleeeeeeaaaaseee!!!!!
Please make an album with full versions of each of these songs!
Big  respect…..
Bravo guys, what a great medley!
did not know i needed this but then again the 90s so i probably did. thanks!
This restored my hope in humanity
More " Be my lover " and " whats love " pretty pleaseeee
Can we PLEASE get a full version of Believe ❤️❤️❤️😫😫😫
Улёт!!!!
been following you guys since high school and still amaze 😍
I want the blue checkered print jacket
Can you please do "Deliver us!" from Prince of Egypt. You guys could really rock it. The instrumental sections as your vocals (beside the actual vocals) would be incredible. Please please please do a complete and accurate version (not medley, since it's ALREADY a medley and a great one). Thanks! I know you guys will be probably the best choice for this. There are VERY few good Deliver us! covers out there, and no good karaoke videos for it at all :(.
People! We need a full version of all the songs, actually!
So good
Apparently Korone is a fan
They are so perfect(●♡∀♡)
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Muito bom
Hmm… I suppose you could interpret the title as „90´s style“ otherwise the 2006 Cascada song wouldn‘t match in there… though Maggie Reilly‘s version was released in 1992, so I guess we can let that slide (and it sounds amazing) 😉
Theme from a summer place, please sing in your next album.
spotify link!!!!???
2:14 Everytime We Touch 😍😍
😘😘😘😘😍
wow so cooooooooooooool
Finally Ariel happened to me one wash clean sa labada in just 7.50 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Any Filipinos out here
I hope you guys will cover The Fox from Ylvis
Hi guys, if you do an 80's remix, please do it from a Euro perspective. That's where all the best music was. Don't forget The Cure (Pictures of You!!), Freddy, Duran Duran etc.
Damn, this slaps 🔥
Damn shame you went the hollywood route and messed your lips up dear What a waste of beauty
Petition for a full version of all songs in this video
Hey, the 90's just called to say PTX was better before they got big.
This is amazing, for sure, but I wish the audio wasn’t edited. They are excellent a cappella. They don’t need the extra.
hit me right in the nostalgia
If you wonderful talented people did a full album of these songs, I would definitely buy it. This is fantastic!!!!
I need an audio version of this! so addicting
I'm CRYING! 🔥🔥🤯
hate it
Pleaseeeeeeeee i need "Believe" FULL version
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kirstie, you are rocking those curls!! Great video!!🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
So awesome to hear Sonique in this mix – love this!! <3
Whew... EVERYONE in this video 🔥
I just noticed that Mitch used to be the one who moves a lot in their videos but he usually sways his body side to side. Now I see it's Kirsten the one moving her body so much like aggressively shaking her shoulders and also awkwardly putting her hands on her shoulders and neck
2:56〜　My favorite
So freaking awesome 👏🏼 thank you
☺️👍🏼😆😍
Sensacional esse mix de músicas,poderiam gravar uma por uma completa que ficaria maravilhoso .Essas vozes são um espetáculo.
Wait.. listen to 4:16 to 4:23 and 4:33 to 4:40 is it just me or does it sound autotuned??? No offence to these peeps they are really good singers but just…🤔🤔🤔
Hi guys!! You should do "the wellerman" 😍😁😁
Play this at 1.25 speed
1:14 how the hell is that a capella?
You sound so good but I wonder what happened to the old you guys you used to be righteous and I'm wondering who is the new guy
What happened to you guys 😞🥺
You used to be righteous what happened
What happened to the other guy and what did you do your hair was so beautiful before it's beautiful now but I think that you looked great before
Eff4hu
Every single song that comes out I watch it IMMEDIATELY 🤣🤣
Op
Espectacular!!
I've already became silent even right when the video started-
I would pay money for the what is love part
Absolutely amazing!
Only one song missing from this: Where Do You Go - No Mercy  Otherwise, great mix and fantastic job! Some of these need standalone covers.
I haven't heard some of these songs in SO LONG. Thank you for this beautiful and nostalgic mix!
Que saudade dessas músicas!!!!
I would Love to hear Pentatonix do a Full version of Beautiful Life!❤️📺🎶
I knew that one day, Freddy Mercury would be successful in life
2:15 - 3:11 is my fav part
Is this heaven?
Complete version of every theme, please!!!
where we can download their music?
OMG I hadn't seen this group since 2014 ,they still make amazing music 🤩
Kirstin is so so beautiful in this video!
Ok wow I knew every song right off the bat. This was my genre I listened to in the 90's
I feel like every music video my Pentatonix would be in an episode of black mirror
I really need a full version of Finally. That song sounds so amazing with their voices.. omg.
Set to 1.5 speed. Enjoy.
EIFFEL 65 and GABRY PONTE ITALIAN PRIDE🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
I love you!!
Just confirming that every bit of sound is coming from their vocals? 🤯
Kirsten's Latina eyes are especially beautiful in this video. She stole my heart.
90s is 30 years ago  Thinking of that ; )
Mitch 😍😍😍😍😍 even with only 0:05 la da de dee la da da daw 2:55 da be dee da be da and 4:45 La de dee la de daw.. 😅😁
Пипец, русским зашло по самые помидоры... до мурашек) такое ностальжи )))) Пятера , вам пятера ))))) Молодцы)))
Simply fantastic! Extraordinary performance! Love it
Could listen to this medley all day. How awesome would be a 90s cover album :D
👍👍👻
Id love to take vocal lessons from mitch since I know I can hit that high but I need to learn tone control. ( Not tone deaf but don't have a lot of control) but that would literally be like a dream. Him and Scott could both help me because of my  range
신나!신나~~~
the magic of acapella and autotune
The transition between everytime we touch and blue was 🔥🔥🔥
Missed the chance to shake your head "roxbury-style" ;)
Beautiful
What happened to her lips?>
Isn't "What Is Love" 1980s? Great medley, beuatiful vocals, Oh Snap!!!
Je vous t'aime trop. 😍😙😘😍
Mon groupe préféré oh my Godness.
Poseł full Version Of All songs
Dahm, nostalgic hits in hard :D
Brilliant!!! 👌👌
I love you, Pentatonic!
I need 50s/60s medley so hard.
Where is Avi Kaplan?
I know nobody asked but I really dislike Kirsten’s lip job.
😶✨
Kirstin : The best Kevin : Cool Mitch : Kind of Weird (no offense) Matt : Normal  Scott : Master of the Chin movement
Meu, muito bom! Sensacional mesmo!!!
Love it!
Y'all are fantastic! This brought me straight back to roller skate rinks in the 90s...
Ich denk das soll ein 90er Mix sein? 80% des Liedes sind 2000er, 6 setzen...das könnt ihr aber besser. In den 90er waren backstreet boys, snap, britney, Dr. Alban, captain Hollywood, vanilla ice, shaggy, UB40 usw.
I would really enjoy hearing them do a full cover of EVERYBODY DANCE NOW.   Pentatonix just is so very incredible in their artistry. Whoever does the video work is incredible, as well.
Where are my glowsticks?! 💛💚💙❤💜
Maravilhosooos! 💖💖👏👏👏👏
Blows my mind that they never use music
WTF The best I've heard in a long time, I'm from the 90's and I thank you for this video, I live in Cuba and I'm a # 1 fan of pentatonix.
Ok who else is proud for knowing all these songs?
Unbelievably amazing! 90’s dance music in just over 5 minutes. Love it.
I ❤ U !!!!
ゆりやんレトリィバァ‪w
Vengaboys 😀 great stuff
ヤバいな...なんだこの人達...ずっと聞いてられる
I had to look if Kirstin left the group...never knew she did plastic surgery...damn
Hermoso 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Sonique 😍😍😍😍😍😍
You guys are so impressive.. I love how your voices function together, that's so satisfying
Parabéns vocês são muito profissionais #Oss
Comments be like  Can we have the full version of *litterally any song* 😍
4:00
The best !!!!
Everytime we touch is not from the 90s 😊
This is really enjoyable
Вы класссссссс
Thnks U 4 sung Top Hit from italian's Band Eiffel65.
Yeah.... Hello to the 90's kids...
¿Está en spotifi?
awww
this 1 guy is so sexy. so different style. hell i love that guy
This is the best remix I have heard. I LOVE it sooo much. ❤️  ❤️  ❤️
Не перестаю восхищаться!!!👍👍👍
can i get this mix somewhere?
As a 90s kid i really enjoyed this video.
Класс class!!!
It's not the same without Avi.
I love u music, but I'm confused. Cascada - everytime we touch, is from 2006.
U should do an early 2000s remix
RIP Transition 🙁😟
Gotta do Around The World (La la la la la) and Bettter Off Alone. Omg!!!!!!!!
This might be yall best one!!
I love it
Please do a full remix of Feels So Good
- They're incredible!
I WANT SCOTT'S ENTIRE OUTFIT
Oh soooo good! I forgot how great they are!
She has lips now ????? Where was I oof
OMG the Cascada's track is so good!!! We need the full version please..  Well done Pentatonix :)
Papapapapapapapaprrrr
Hola
I need a hero, pls 🙏
Some members change looks make u think they've been replaced...I'm loving it
The malicious iris syntactically irritate because turnover surprisingly escape than a outrageous tomato. lively, icy august
Every time we touch was straight fire! But that’s not 90s. Pretty sure like 05? But damn that was good
Not going to lie ..I was feeling every song!!!
Why aren’t these guys in pitch perfect?
Mitch sounded pretty dang close to Cher damn. I had to keep replaying this because it just sounds all awesome and totally reminds me of my teen years.
PTX FOREVER! <3 <3 <3
I would like to launch you a challenge  Go to search and listen to “ Ti sento “ by Matia Bazar,  one of best Italian song ever sang. There is an English version “ I feel you “. I’m sure you could make a wonderful version
petition for a full version of believe. who's with me?
Beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍
I need this played in the clubs, please and thank you.
😎👍🏾
And as well with me live n with you the only way is I’m soooo sorry to say this but you will have to replace Kristin Maldonado and put me in her place so I can take over. You need me !!!!!!!!!
Nice 😃
Awesome and now please an 80s Medley pleeeaaase!!! <3
who else remember they almost did believe by cher on sing-off years back? and finally we're getting it (atleast a good part of it)
Make a full cover for each please!
Muito locoo
More amazing every time ❤
i love this
Super voise
What sup with the lack of black music...?
OMG. YA'LL make me want to dance all night, the memories!!!!
4:15 - 4:22 4:31 - 4:44  in LOVEEEE
I'm setting 0:37-0:52 as my ringtone
Anyone else a purist like me and feels a little betrayed that Everytime We Touch (2006) was included in this 90s medley?
my childhood in under 6 minutes... just awesome!
Love PTX. Love them a little less without Avi, but Matt's smile is so contagious I can't not like him. Is there anyone that feels Scott needs to stop drinking so much?  It's starting  to show. Before I get attacked he is the first to admit his love of drinking.
Dude I'm sorry I wish I had something nice to say but like on almost every video lately especially with that stache you are just...awful looking man. You doing ok? Your natural look is ok, you voice is a amazing as always but your choices in wardrobe and hair are really not pleasant to the eye. I mean you certainly stick out, but in like a ugly duckling sort of way like "aww, even he gets to participate". You're clearly going for "style" in each video but my goodness just having something plain on would be a considerable improvement. Sorry, its rude but someone has to address it. Otherwise video was a banger as always.
3:11 - SLAPS  👋 👋 👋
You used to matter, then Avi and his arrangements, voice, and touch left. Been good voices with nothing else since
I had much more respect to them when they didnt use autotune, a clear example of them using autotune is 4:40
FABULOUS!! 👏👏❤️❤️
Could someone mention each song down below ? 🤔 hahahaha 😂🤣
What about Madonna???
I do love this. However there is only one thing I do need to say...a few of the songs are not even 90s they are 2000s songs. It was an amazing video nonetheless
I really love this hairstyle on Kirstin! The overly over lined lip was distracting in the close up shots but still she is really pretty!
jak vás mám rád, tak tohle se nepovedlo ...
Please do on Michael Jackson too you are my life🙏
All around the world blongs to 2000s right?
Gosh, I've got goosebumps. You should make the evolution of dance music though
Every time we touch isn't a 90s dance hit, it came out in 2005... I mean it's a great medley and I love them as a group and individually but let's get some dates right ya'll lol
Well today I learned that ATC stands for A Touch of Class
Love you guys!
This. Was. Epic.
We need a Blue da ba dee Cover NOW!!!
この調子で80‘sも70‘sもかましてください！！
Everybody dance now!
Omg.. I want this music on Spotify! 😍
I love so much to see Mbappe beatboxing
I feel like ima cry 😢😭 I love all these songs. Have to put on my Playlist at work lol
Wonderful as always 👏👏👏
Goosebumps on Gypsy Woman🖤
Incredible as always !!
I forgot some of these great song.  Now I'm going to go look them us and save them. Thanks for the great video.
My therapist: “what encapsulates the best memories of your childhood?” Me: *shows him this*
We can all admit the 90s was the best era of music
She looks like Sandy at the end of Grease ♥
WOOOWW THIS WAS REAAALLY CRAZY🤩
THIS IS GIVING ME LIFE!!!!
Ahora me dieron ganas de ver todas las canciones completas hechas por ellos. 🤪🥰😂😍😍😍
Scott looks like a mashup up of Gordon Ramsey and James Corden.
Mi hanno fatto tornare ventenne ❤
Wow, you are  the best band ¡
Как здорово👏✊👍
Omg im so in love this medley. this is so my music besides rock and metal. you guys let me dance through the whole living room. best video ever!! love you pentatonix!!
Beatboxer is cheating
Love em soooo much.....so groovy🥰😍
懐かしい曲ばかり ありがとうございます❣️
Good song choices, great voices. Each should be a full song on a 90s pentatonix album. However,  I feel like this kind of became the Scott and Mitch band…? Also what happened to Kirstins lips?
❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Pray to forget the world.  BE HAPPY
Da a impressão que o vídeo foi feito para mim porque estou com mania dessa época faz tempo!
Damn! This is the best almost 6 minutes 😍 Love 3:38 ❤️
When Avi sings the lead, Scott does the bass part. He can also sing high. Scott's got a hhuuugeee vocal range.
Temazoooooo o o o o o o ssss
You 5 have such an awesome talent! I do wish this video was longer, than you gave each song a bit longer to shine.. but it feels like nitpicking.  You're awesome. I love you all!
2:14 cinta satu malam, wkwkwk
Plz do full versions of everything!
Fodásticos
Let's take a moment to truly appreciate this video! It's hard to do dance music a cappella. ❤️
I used to be a huge fan. I still remembered how my jaw was dropped and dragging far across the room when i watched Daft Punk medley. But this is nothing like that ; ( sorry.  I understand there is a lot of genre and style to cover and will probably be much harder to connect them. But the many transitions here are just abrupt, felt like I click on next track on the player.
Does anyone knownwhere this medely is available for purchase
I love kristin' tattos, it'is so beautiful and i love lalala song, it sounds amazing
Make an Iko Iko ane cover!! please!! it would be awsome!!!!
Супер!!!😙
Alway the best group
That last song "Finally"; I did not know that it was an original song from 90s. Only heard it from a commercial here in Philippines, Ariel -- a brand of detergent.
Tellement incroyable ❤️
THE BEST OF THE BEST
Not enough Dabu dee, dabu daay.  We need more Dabu dee, dabu daay!
I feel like you guys went into my personal playlist cause all those song 🎶 are on it and I’m honestly saying that this is my new favorite!
petition for a full version of “believe”
Uf 👏 the best ,ever !!!
This was not their best. I’m not impressed line I normally am with their music. This medley was not good in my opinion.
Please tell me I'm just seeing things but it looks like she had plastic surgery on her lips..gross
what about gangsta paradise and other rap songs :/
Pentiton what is love
SO GOOD!!!!
hi Lorena
cant believe that 13 millions subscriber passed on this.
oh dear... you can see why Avi left. This really has degenerated to lowest common denominator and nobody looks happy here. Scott looks hungover, Mitch looks like Freddie Mercury in his later years, Kirstin looking like a weird combination of Beyonce/Madonna in a fake, plastic way. Even Kevin, who usually looks the same, is bordering on Miami gangster (the beard!). Matt, unchanged but then he was always doing this for the money.  These guys need to stop touring, let Matt and Kevin do their duo thing they're desperate to do (they clearly have the most chemistry and drive in the group) and you guys either need to take a step back to recording Beatles-style, or stop entirely. I'm saying that 'cause I love you guys, but I seriously can't recognise the young musicians I fell in love with here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lExW80sXsHs
90's best 🥰
LISTEN!!!! this has to be your best medley to date.. I know y'all had fun with this. I was almost in tears BRAVA 👏🏼👏🏼
This needs to be a full album. Bloody brilliant 👏👌
Love your music, if i could change 1 thing about it tho is get rid of the unneccesery autotune it makes everyones voice sound like that of a robot.
BELIEVE was my FAVORITE!
Ребята, вы очень крутые!
Wow! I love this medley! ... now... where do I get those glasses? :D
Honestly would be annoyed about 'Every time we touch' being on here since it's not 90s but it's by far the one that sounded best.
I would love an entire album of each of these songs! Really love the smash-ups but they just wet my appetite...leave me wanting more and more!
Ohh...i loved it all
I liked to hear the full version of blue daba de daba die
back to your roots, sounds great 👍

There is nothing I hate more than when a PTX song ends.
Woooow très bon
Show
You guys should do a full song of BIF Naked- Spaceman!! Please that'll be soo epic!! 👏👏🤞🤞😎😎
Squee!  As someone going through school during the 90s, some of these songs popular on the elementary bus and some of these major hits at the prom, this was SO delightful I don't even have words.  And the payoff, the whole time I'd  been wondering if they'd include Blue, "No, that song is kinda iconic 90s, but it's so silly, they wouldn't, would they?"  And then 2:56.  You guys turned my day around!
Super. ♥️
Americans sing Eurodance ! Greetings from Germany !
<3 ❤❤❤❤
Крутые.
Какие же талантливые ребята! Я в восхищении! 😍😍😍😍😍
This is great but i dont think they was even born when these songs came out lol.

This is one fine mix..... Nicely Done!
Can we get a dance medley for every different decade please!🙏   Please when this Covid-19 crap is over will, you come to Gothenburg Sweden pretty please. Love Pentatonix!🎶😄❣
What an iconic decade. The further we get from it I think we'll see more and more.
Are they seriously doing this will all their voice? I feel like there's music in this. this is AMAZING. I feel like Clark in the office when he hears Andy Bernards A cappella group.
*Moustache Mitch*
Psst, PSST hey, do a good 4 u/ misery business mash up thanks XD Or the two separately or just one but it needs to be done, please! XD
I'm waiting for Imagine Dragons - Follow you by PTX
how dare you make a list of 90's and miss  "The Rhythm of the Night" - Corona? Are you kidding me?
They just keep getting better❤️
Just listen to this now and I keep on head banging on each song~
i want to be in Kirsten room
2020 in rap lol xoxo

Every Time We Touch is definitely not a 90's dance song, thank you very much for making me feel older than I am for a sec.  (Yes I'm aware the original was '92 but those verses weren't in it)
Still waiting for Sea Shanty

Been gone from PTX a while. Who does the heavy base now? As the new guys seems to do beat box as well as the other beat boxer.
Amazing!!
ya'll gotta do a Tears For Fears - Everybody Wants To Rule The World

This is da bomb! (Is that era appropriate? I have no idea, I was just a kid in the 90s!)

God....
Big shout out to the editing guys, a quiet but awesome work
i would love more of these type of medleys, the oldies are the best!
I just heard Nightbirde's song on AGT--It's Okay.  It is beautiful...I thought if anyone--any group could do a just cover of it, it would be Pentatonix...I don't know what rights you have to secure, but I KNOW you can do it as richly as the composer--Nightbirde.
Do you believe in love sounds so good and of course every time we touch sounds amazing
merci     jaime    boucous   fan
la da ra di ra da ra da :D
cuando aran algún concierto en España que voy fijo
Cascade- Everytime we touch was in 2006 Not in the 90s

Full version of all this list... 🙏 damn so good  . specialy blue and everytime we touch hahahaha..
Огонь
I bet they are worth more than 5000 musical instruments combined!!!:-)
this has to make 100 million views before the end of the year!!
90's vibez
Avi Kaplan, i miss u :T
Make sure you're listening with headphones 🔥
Why is 90s dance medley not available on apple music and where is it available for download
Brings back memories!!😍😍😍😍
I read 90s Dance Medley and gave it a thumbs up before even listening lol
Fantástic great 90s
man I'm in love with your voices, I have the misfortune to have an extremely acute hearing, and few voices to me sound as beautiful as yours, including the beatbox, I'm in love xD
Requesting a remix of everytime we touch and blue
2000's Dance Medley Please
As always... Nailed it. And yet, can't BELIEVE you guys left out Sandstorm... If anyone could have pulled that one off, it's y'all! What?!? Oops... that was 2000, but it sure kept the 90s vibe going!
I need a full version of believe...matt really proving he belong in ptx..magical.
One hell of a medley, God bless you
Jjdcjnf
It's a beautiful life!!! Boom boom boom!
Great choices of songs! Thank you for sharing this!
0:52 I wanna listen to the full version of better off alone
I wish as I was watching, I could filter individuals out just to hear what part of the harmony they each contribute. Amazing
0:52  2:55  my favorite part.
Ohhhhh they're always on fire 🔥🔥🔥
Mitch getting to flex his vocal lead muscles in most of this, but who decided that part of it should be auto-tuned? You have 5 *AMAZING* vocalists and you auto-tune them??? SERIOUSLY???
I don't get tired listening to this medley... brings lots of 90's memories..... can't stop moving... and singing with them as well....
guys, never stop, I've been here since 2012, and you've always been amazing
これはPentatonix最高傑作なのでは...！！最高すぎる。
🔥🔥🔥
solos mejores
la rompen.. son unos genios.
If Dastardly & Ming the Merciless had a child.
1:56 goosebumps!
You are the best vocal band I've ever heard !!! I wish you never stopped!
I wish your band could do your versions of these songs individually
If just dance is gonna put covers in the game it needs to be pentatonix
OMG *_*
The outfits are awesome!! And they are great!!
Wow.....
Omg amazing
GOD i wish this was on spotify
Petition for a hole 90s cover album!!
Are they using autotune?
Omg it is SO good🙈❤️
CHER!
The girl (sorry I don't know your names) sings better than many of the originals imo, especially do you think your better off alone. The guy that sings the higher parts, with the mustache, also has an absolutely amazing voice. I feel like any of you could be a mainstream professional pop artist, and are better than a lot of the radio top 40 singers out there. Btw that half sleeve tattoo is pretty dope
I'd never heard Pentatonix before until today and I'm ecstatic! As a teenager in the 90s I listen to these songs almost every day. I wish they had done some version of DJ Bobo's hits though, but this was phenomenal. 💙
as a 90's baby  i love the way they bring these hits back to life!!!!
Me: okay I'm born in 1990. But no way I will know- Also me: 🥺 my childhood
👍😍muy buen mix
Still with i bangers I love those guys❤
Since I was in the 4th grade I known about them and now I'm 18 like damn
Its crazy knowing how long I've known about these guys
this needs to be available on itunes.
Hello, i'm from Russia, you're fantastic, спойте пожалуйста Wallerman)
Listening to this cover at 0.5x speed is mood✨
Th—   Came out of a group of humans? What 😯😯
Awesome!!
Ha! Their copying medleys, voiceplay has done alot of medley. Also you guys arent good.
Please Sonique - It feels so good acapella version
Can we get full versions of every song???
Какие же вы крутые!!! Могу слушать бесконечно!....Обожаю вас!!!
I honestly never gave these people a chance but on a whim I did. They are so incredibly talented!!!! Kudos!!!!! Huge fan now!!!!
I miss SUPERFRUIT :(
Guren no yumiya would be great if u guys covered it
Since day 1 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯
Another masterpiece by PTX. You guys never fail to astound us.
I MISSED YOU GUYS AAA
How did people NOT like this?! So good!
How u doing this?! This super cool... my favorite music metal, but this amazing.
Me love pentatonix
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😘😘🥰😍🤩🤩🥳
I don't know if this was intentional (probably was) but does the background remind anyone else of the background in old 90s school pictures? Like the same style? Is it just me?
A song they need to do is RUNAWAY by Aurora!!!😍😍
Ребята, вы невероятные! Большое спасибо за ваш труд, за настроение, которое вы дарите, за ваш удивительный и прекрасный вокал! Успехов вам, друзья, и вдохновения и радости! Мы ждём вашего творчества и всегда с вами 😘
No longer are the beats legit via beat box. It’s super produced at this point.
The medley ended so soon! I would have kept on listening for another 10 minutes!
I just love Mitch's voice in What is Love 🤩  And Kevin really shines throughout the whole medley! ❤️
ALL BEAUTIFUL!!! I’M IN lOVE!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everytime We Touch came out in 2006 tho lmao
I think that is the best 5 minutes ever
When mitch did the instrumental for Alice Deejay, I SCREAMED. That's insane. He shatters the actual boundaries of what a human voice can do. 90s euro beat and techno is my comfort food nostalgia music and this was unbelievable ♥
Her hair mhernnn😍😍
You guys still exist???
Trying to do Mitch part of the song its so high..🙇🏼‍♂️
Sempre tô aqui no meu Brazil véi esperando vídeos dos melhores...amo muito super admiro sou fã número 1@...eles arrasam de mais
Loved it! 👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE THEM SO.FUCKING.MUCH THAT I CAN'T STAND IT. 😍
Интересно смотреть, как вы взрослеете.. а я  - старею...
Songs names in this video pls
Супер! возврат в 90е! исполнение на высоте!
I know I'm a day late, but happy 10 year anniversary!
This is really just a medley of the Night at The Roxbury soundtrack
Ima be that guy but everything we touch came out in 2006...
How does Mitch look so much like Freddy Mercury and also have the range of Freddy Mercury?  ...He's a clone, isn't he?
Fantastycznie !!!! Wspaniałe wykonanie.
Tell me M'baku and Kevin are related  hahaha
Best ever. My clubbing generation.  Nuff said. (insert mic drop)
I want full versions of Everytime we Touch and Believe
C'mon guys !....Auto-tuned ??....Really ??   Massive disappointment, and a massive destraction/subtraction fro m your performance.  Please don't do that anymore - it defeats the purpose of an acapella performance,,,,plus, you all have perfect pitch as it is - don't detract from that talent by using electronically enhanced vocals.  Absolutely ANYONE can put out an acapella tune if using auto-tune, or other electronically tricks.  Smacks of a little bit of desperation in competition among musical sounds of the day.....not a way to stay relevant....stick to talent, it got you here.  *
FILIPINO RADIO EVERY SUNDAY!
Mitch: "Everybody dance now!"  Kevin: *time to show off*
PETITION TO HAVE A FULL VERSION OF CHER'S BELIEVE! 😭😭💖💖
Is the Amish to gay 🏳️‍🌈?
Could you do the Addams family?
This was absolutely ear candy. I would have loved to hear some Kristine W though. Just saying. She was the 90s.
Ooohhh man it took me back.... Thank you so much PTX almost a tear in my eye sooooo good
Amazing! When I heard them sing a Cher song I heard Cher. When I heard them sing a Madonna Song I heard Madonna. I would love to hear them do every top hit since 1960.
They NEED to do a «i may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it” cover!!! It would be awesome🙊🙉🤩
Hostia mbappe, como hace beatbox. Vaya fichajazo se va a llevar el MAdrid
HAPPY 10th Anniversary!! #PTX10
WHOLE ALBUMN OF THESE PLEASE!!
Amazing !! 👏👏👏
Everytime we touch from cascada is from 2006... great cover tho!
LOVE their take on music.  Wish women wouldn't feel the need to inject their lips.  It doesn't look natural.
Wonderful
Happy 10th anniversary PENTATONIX!!! 🎶
Petition to give their video editor a fucking award.
Between her rendition of Digital Love in the Daft Punk medley and Everytime We Touch here, Kirstin has proven she's incredible at singing dreamy-type songs.
5:09   Finally ARIEL happen to me, one wash clean sa labada for just 7.50!   Anyone? hahaha
Fantastic! I would buy this album.
I confess I've lost touch with you guys lately but it's good to see you are still absolutely fantastic!!
I love the girl on the band <3
Shut up and take my money! Wait! DON'T shut up and take my money!
Que diver 🤗
#Scoot and Kirstin are together# because i saw them kissing, 😘🥰😍
I could meet you but we got to live with what we have
I love your music
You are simply AMAZING. Greetings from Italy 🇮🇹😍
We need a full version of all! Plz
0:51 you're welcome
please add this to apple music... loved it
I want the full version of Better Off Alone, please?
Anyone else get a sense there’s a subliminal message about an upcoming album here? Maybe not every song is used, but likely most!
Amazing group. Truly a gift from God. Also, Kevin is from my small hometown. Met him once and he took a pic with us, genuinely such a kind person!! Exactly how you would imagine honestly..Quite unbelievable actually, considering we don’t have talent like that from here too often. 😆 anyway, just wanted him to know that there are people in small town KY that are SO PROUD of all he has accomplished!!!!
Love this group but they missed the opportunity to do the "head bob" during "What Is Love"...the Butabi brothers do not approve.
Can y’all do Istanbul?
@Pentatonix you guys should do a natural cover by Imagine dragons
Ai foi foda so as boas anos 90
Keep doing it nerds.  The world needs this and loves ya.
4:50🙌🏿
Petition for a full version of "Finally" 🖐
I NEED A FULL VERSION OF BELIEVE BY CHER
Soooooo good!!!!! Thank You ❤❤❤❤
I can't even remember they were just a back choirs for Todrick hall. I'm not saying now they changed and I just can't handle that, Just kinda miss them. damn I have to go back to History of music Pt.1
Super! ❤️
Make all songs full versions .. it's a revolution

It's amazing how they keep it up after all these years 🎶🎶🎶
are there any straight singers in the world anymore.... so sick of this feminine boy crap.
Very nicely done. Like it. But I suppose some digital effect it is used to boost their voices.
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! I JUST NOTICED AVI LEFT PENTATONIX
How appropro that I'm watching this June 1st!

Oh my God!So amazingly talented young people !!!Love you guys!!!!!
I'm surprised that the replay button isn't dead yet😅😂
2:14 walau cinta kita sementara, aku merasa bahagia~ CINTA SATU MALAM OH INDAHNYA 😆💃🎶
Dang, now I want to go to the skating rink!!!
Some of these were not actually 90s and came out in the early 2000s. I would know cuz I remember exactly how old I was when all these songs came out. So who ever put them together was not accurate but Micthes "Deep down Inside " vocal take was so sick though! I could listen to that on loop all day!
was doin great until 40 seconds in and the flashy stuff  !  Sorry , ADD is rough with flashing stuf. Had to shut this off.  I really enjoy Pentatonix but guys please ... this is the 2nd video of Pentatonix that I could not watch and commented as such. Respects...
back the essences Congrats
F_ck! the best choir ever in mankind . Send this youtube file to the Voyager in space!  So other galactic civilizations will enjoy this too Come on! Choir Gods !
The Time Machine does exist and it is music. I went back to when I was 20.  Thanks *PTXofficial* Greetings from Bogota Colombia

Fantastic!
Reliving my best years in 5 minutes 44 seconds! Love it!

💙BLUE💙 is the word 💚🤍❤️
Does anyone else notice that they are changing??
WOW 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So cute!! 🥰🥰
1:55 Your love feels so good... that did me in!!!! Yall are amazing!!!
They have to do 90s R&BandHipHop now
Thank God I am still alive to hear my childhood musics combined together.
It's so crazy how far these people have come and help think they've gone and I've been watching them since 2013
The 70s and 80s where a zillion times better .... Feel sorry about all of those people that find out "Dreams" and had no clue who Fleetwood Mac was , they thought it was a new song and you need it to drink Cranberry Juice
"Every time we touch" was I favorite part of the song
Some of these definitely need a full cover version!!
I love their music. Have been a fan for 4 years!
Im totally vibing right now🎶🎶😎
where is the white guy that does the bass?

What happened to the other white dude?
Professional's! С ума сойти!!! Geniuses!!!!1
Can someone tell me who is who?
Con le viste belle voci siete un orchestra. Mi piace l'armonia che avete fra di voi,,, è necessario essere amici per raggiungerla. Stanotte sognerò di poter cantare con voi,,, tante cose belle per la vostra vita.
Thank you! I love 90's dance music!
Perfection
Hagan de se le a quintanilla

F_ING AWESOME !!!! There are lots of a cappella groups and there is THE a cappella Group and that's definitely Pentatonix ! They always deliver, they're always breathtaking and they always make me feel good when I listen to them. You just have to love them !!!

You folks are so good! DITCH the "Auto tune", please!
Ehh..   This was a little too much of a gay vibe for me. Soooo much talent in this band though..
not long enough!
I'm  astonished. I can't believe you did it only by your mouth :-D. You have much better  vocals and beats than the original intepreters. Thank you and wish you more success.
Maravilhoso,Parabéns a todos! Brasil 2021🇧🇷
They nailed it !

Jesus F&@$ing Christ. You guys can’t be stopped. I would rather listen to you then the real versions. The sky is the limit. Keep getting it. We love you!!
Every Time We touch came out in 2005 not the 90's.
It's so beautiful
Music of the 60s
Cool😎😎😎
...welp, the nostalgia train hit hard xD also, Kevin, if we don't get some sweet lullabies in the future (baby first, of course ;-) ), I would be very sad ^^ congratulation to being a father now :-)
I love these dance hits❤️
Beautiful
Great music and Pentatonix's version is just a good combination
Aaannnndd I'm back in High School. Strong as ever! But Mitch..  you're killin me my guy!! The initial open and the entrance of 'Better off Alone" (which is one of the first songs I ever remixed)... just chills. You killed bro! Well, you all crushed it, but Mitch just annihilated this one!
cool, alle lieder in voller länge wäre nice
Damm this is kickass. Id die for a full version of better off alone, that was so amazing
Live the door open, just
How about an 80s medley?
Wow! Reviví momentos maravillosos✨❤️🎶 Bailé y canté ✨✨✨ Son los mejores✨🎶❤️

Yes! I'm never disappointed.😍 Consistent voices😊 MUSIC🐐s!
Can your next album please just be full versions of all of these songs? 😍
I literally have to listen to this a minimum of 3 times every time I come here. I need this on Apple Music. Seriously. 🙏🏻
Where was some of the rock from the 90s like zombie??
OMG i need the full versions of all the songs <3 WOW
I LOVE IT!!!!!!! You guys nailed this nostalgia so goooooooood <3
I need a whole version of rhythm is a dancer😍
2:56 vou colocar essa parte como meu despertador
Somehow I fell in love with all of them at once
Y'all almost made me cry. I'm a 90's child and knew every single one of these songs. It was like reliving my childhood.
the "look" of these folks is always laughable. like the status quo of ridiculous
Every Time we touch Is from 2007 not 90 🤔
Pentatonix covers the Night at the Roxbury Soundtrack!
That mustache is disturbing tho.
A full version of "it feel so good", PLEASE.
ear tingles
It was about time! <3 wooot! Eurodance is still largely appreciated in Europe and your video just made me waggle all along. Thank you guys =)

Hola Como estan
This is amazing. Brings back so many memories. Thanks
I honestly don't understand how anyone can give this a thumbs down. No Hate... but if anyone wants to explain why they didn't like this medley, please let me know. Again, No Hate intended. Pure curiosity on my end. Peace & Love.
Matt at 1:59 gives me soooooo muuuuuch liiiiiiiiife!!!
oh my god!  yes!!!
Really, really love you! All of you!! :)
Hi I am a big fan
I'd love to hear you guys do kylie minogue songs
I wish I could say I like this but I can only say I’m so glad they changed to the way they sound today. This I woulda play again. Today I can’t seem to hear enough.
Omgggg I am a huge fan of you guyssss!!! This is amazinggggggg 😭 😭 😭
I’d forgotten about some of these...now I need to listen to them on repeat to make up for lost time.
Petition for a full version of Believe 🤩
Top 👌
los amo pentatonix.....  I LOVE YOU PENTATONIX.....
Only those who had the best childhood in the 90s know the nostalgia that video brings in our memory.
I need the full version of "everytime we touch" ☹️
Oh yes! The pure joy of borning early enough to know all these songs.
'as always... So good❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why isnt this song still not available on spotify
I love your vocal versions, could you make a Disney megamix please?
You guys really should do Earth, Wind & Fire's "September"   I think this is right up your alley.
They should do a full version of 1:58
Pity Kristin felt she needed Botox, can't stop looking  now
Evolution of Demi Lovato…i think it would be fire personally.
OMG I'M STUCK IN THIS VIDEO. All my childhood is here.
The 90s really was the golden age of dance. So many nostalgic feelings for all of these songs ❤️ I feel old.
where is avi
👍❤️
The actually jeans orally comb because double mechanistically support apud a rude shrimp. miniature, workable quality
Omg that's so hot 🔥🕺🏻💃🏻
We need a '80s, '00s and a '10s version of all the dance jams too like ASAP. I originally watched this on Facebook but it's still 🔥🔥🔥🔥 everywhere else...
In love with this!! ❤❤
I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
The living prose interspecifically trot because law selectively remind abaft a kaput gorilla. irate, bad fertilizer
I had a pair of glasses the shape of Scott's shades!
Amazing like always!!

自分に曲作ってください。泉川秀太チャンネル
Thank you 😊
This song is my brain with 90's songs on replay when work gets silent lol
The last time I watch them was in 2014 and I’m coming back right now but I don’t see Avi. Where is he ?
Some of these are from aren’t from the 90s.
楽しそうに歌ってるとこっちまで楽しい気分になります！
Great, now I need the full album version of this
What an awesome medley. This is so nice, thanks so much for this!
where is the other member? the one who does bass ?
Só a brazucada que curte esse grupo sensacional, senta o like aê🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Brasil❤
Love ❤show show🥰🥰🥰🥰
where its needed i cant tell if they're throwing it or if they're selectively using an autotune, knowing them they probably worked out a way to do it manually. appreciate the required syth for "im blue" as well
We need an 80’s melody with some songs like take on me , and never give you up
4:15 Oh no ! what's that fucking voice effect ?
You're a super group 🤩🤩🤩
This gave me goosebumps 🥰 love this! The nostalgia ✨
THIS SOUNDS FUCKING AMAZING AND EVERYONE LOOKS GOOD
At this time there are 5.8m views, 282k up votes, and 2.2k down votes. What the hell is in the heads of all the down-voters that they don't like this awesome video??
"LIKE" for a full version of "Believe" !
Am I the only one who was told as a kid it was actually "If I was he I would die". Might already be in the comments but too lazy to look lol
Scott's smile at the end, he knows he nailed it from the first note to the very last 😅. I just love his groove and his confidence, his voice is so versatile, I love how he harmonizes with Kirstie in "Believe" in the chorus his voice is so smooth. God I love him.
THEY CHQNGED SO ?UCH FRO? 2016
Pure talent...
I need this on spotify to i can have it on repeat please
supeeeeeeeeeeeeer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It would be much appreciated if you did Butter by BTS 🥰
yo is that Demi Lovato?
AMAZING
Just a thought after hearing this, might consider covering Client Black's State of Mind. I think everyone's vocals would just shine and I'd be so interested in what kind of beats Kevin could come up with( a touch of steel guitar perhaps). You could even change the violin solo to a cello solo for what I believe would be an unreal experience. And the message fits perfectly with everything you do.
2:36 I’m blue
1:38 boom boom boom I want you I’m my room. so short
I love this medley so much! It's incredibly beautiful and catchy!!! Could you maybe do a cover of "Mr. Unicorn" by D'Sound? I know, it would sound absolutely amazing! YOU are amazing! 💛💛💛
2:56 i’m blue if I were green I would die
1:38 the best part
Some are far better than the original.👆😊.If I could give the whole version I already have chills on my body.❤
Wooooooh ! SOOOOO TALENTED !!💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻INCREDIBLE!!!! LOOOOVE YOU ALL 😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🎶🎶🎶🎶
I can't not smile, when I see Matt sing. That smile on his face...  Althogh it's so good to see how they all enjoy music and singing! 😍
Wow!!! I love this song!!
This cover is better then any garbage out today.
I swear I can't stop listening to this😩😩❤ This is my most played song for weeks now
they are going through a goth phase
This set my 90s baby soul on fire 🔥  And ya ... full songs .. new album 💯 on board
OH.  This hit me RIGHT in my childhood!  And I LOVE IT!
реально два парня издают звук?
Hello! My name is Ariel and I am from Mexico, I am currently trying to go back to university to study architecture since I had to abandon it due to financial problems. Currently I manufacture handmade bags and I design them, I make them with good quality materials, I do not use synthetic leather, I also make jewelry bracelets, it would really help me a lot if you could support me by buying one or sharing my message, I am a very responsible person. , I ask you to give me the opportunity to sell you one of my products, not only would you take a good product, you would also support me to go back to university, I thank you and I hope you can see my products, I sent you all the good vibes from Mexico. <3
Maravilhoso!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏
Cant get enough of this video❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you pentatonix
Omg EVERYBODY DANCE NOW
Now I want a full "Best of 90s" cover album by PTX so badly. This is simply amazing.
Had this on loop for a hour. No shame 😎
Please just do an album with the full songs of all of these 😂 that Sonique transition was 🔥🔥🔥
they forgot about coco jambo casablanca vengaboys barbie girl vaya con dios
can we listen the full versions of this songs, idk , some of them we need them full...they are too short..this very famous songs sounds very nice from your voices..:D
this is one of the best medley iv seen so far and also Thalia at Latin Grammy 2021 when she sings her 90 s celebrity songs...amazing...i hope romanians also they will do such a great idea singing our 90s ...looks amazing..:D
Love u guys Keep it up 😙😙😙
Definitive the worst music generation 😖
Who else thinks a evolution of JLo is a good idea?
It reminds me GLEE
OMG i can’t wait to heard Every Time We Touch . Love from Viet Nam
I just had a crisis. I grew up with these songs but I’m not a 90’s kid. I actually thought they were 2000’s
Перепойте "кукушка" Виктора Цоя - это будет бомба
I liked them better before they changed their look.
Latinos reportence..
I freaking love every single song and your voices singing them  oh, and it's EURODANCE btw ;)
They used the same effect on “life after love”!
When I say sound effects I mean doing them with their voices.
I think they should've done just the sound effects and tune for some of these songs.
Awesome but disturbing.
It's kind of disturbing how Michel's voice can sound exactly like those sound effects.
🤔🤔 Honestly,  this is my Least favorite thing you've ever done. I will never look this up to play. Hate the added digitized sound too. Sorry. How about a nice beatbox blend with all of you doing something? A capella means a capella. This isnt.
You left me craving for more! Can we have a full version of each one of these songs please? 😁
Kevin.....My Man
Another set that I'll listen to over and over again. Brilliant!
new guy has a voice
I love I'blue  Please do a acapella of welleman
completely did that!!
do you not know the fucking difference between 90's and 00's songs? Are you experiencing brain fog from retro-viral medication?
Espetacular! 👏🏼
Kirstin is the beauty! Love ya
autotune in pentatonix? :(
ahh my middle school dances are coming back to me now.  lol
Still miss the old bass </3
Will be time to come to Frankfurt - wait for you folks!
Que felicidade tão jovens talentos que vocal e harmonia. Com tanto lixo no mercado vocês nossa alma.
Wow!!! Bästa. Love from Sweden 😍🙏🏻❤️
AWESOME!
Why can't i stop listening to this? *laughs knowing the answer*
Today's pop and dance music has no rhythm and catchy melodies compared to the ones from the 90s, or 80s !!
EXO ‏‎‎‎ EXO Comeback... DON'T FIGHT THE FEELING

3:17-- WHATS THE NAME OF THE SONG ???
🦕
Even though I was born in 1995, i know most of these songs. So it's even nostalgic for me!
I dont have the vocals but I still enjoyed singing along to all these hits
wow the im blue part was really lovely
Petition for PTX to do never gonna give you up.
Personally while I like all these songs, I like the original versions better.
Damn Great! All Of Your Performances Are The Best Guys!😁
OMG😍 Everytime we touch was so awesome ❣️
Here is a Spotify playlist for the originals: https:// open.spotify.com/playlist/36sq6cInGxR8RiRZGXm1lG?si=gAIf5ufTQImJtw0JSVyd1w
They really improved alot over the years.. Man I feel old...
wishing Pentatonix would do a cover On the Ground by Rosé of Blackpink
This is amazing!!!!!
90s dance was like : "aa aaa yeah yeah  hii",  "dabadi dabouda" and "boom boom boom" like how to be famous with no lyrics🤣
Wow I'm 16 yo I must be a 90s kid I know all of these songs lol
How did they not include 'In A Dream' by Rockell?????
MEME MUSIC
AHHHHHHH!!!tHIS is what i've been looking for...
MCR Medley pretty please?
Petition for a full version of “Finally- Cece Peniston” ✋🏻
Enjoyed
You guy's have such prefect tones  ... you should seriously consider doing  ...  lean on me and the lion sleeps tonight
Arg, MiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIITCH!!!!!!! His voice is the most fcking angelical sound I've ever heard coming out someone's mouth
I legit just had flash backs to getting home from school and seeing a commercial and hearing "Now thats what I call 90s best hit you can have this 5 disc set for 39.99 must be 18 or older to purchase"
Some of my most favorite songs from the 90s 🥰
A decade summed up in one song
OK...we need a LaBouche medley
Music of my childhood <3 I just had a party alone in my room listening to this. Some songs are missing, like Eurodance hits, but that's okay.
Oh snap they playing my songs!
My millenial ass is living with this 😍
Petition for every song to be full versions 🧡
You guys rock my world😍❤
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
pentatonix moment
3:30 Replay button for Scott's riff  😍😎🥰
Am I the only one who notices it?  but literally the newest member in the whole song only sang 15 seconds, it is not the first time that I see that they do it with Avi Kaplan the same they did it being that they both have a great voice, I think that as a group they should all have the same opportunity to  participate and sing and not only give priority to some hopefully they consider it
Show me love is my part!!!
i love the Songs i need more maybe Disney songs
Why does Mitch look like someone you wouldn't trust with you kids?
Someone is missing in the group🥺🥺
L
Full version of What is love please
New VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PVAwXNgkOw
Kirsti does a better version of waiting for tonight than J-Lo ever could.
This is the mix I didn't realize I needed!
Do a 70s and 80s disco music next 😆😆😆
OMG I’ve been listening to this on repeat for a month already! Surprised there’s only 5.5M views. I must be responsible for at least a thousand of the views 😆
4:51 gives me serotonin
I was a bit mad about all the auto-tune, then I remembered this was supposed to be 90's.
It's been a while! Nice~~
Petition for a full version of Everytime We Touch and Beautiful Life
Would you please cover the Mafia?  It's Itzy'smusic .
90's?
My teenage years summed up in one video, I love it!!! <3
When they started to sing Sonique, it just gave me chills. I love this song sooooooo much and she's a queen! It's impecable how it turned out!
Yay!  Love ❤️
I have listened to this songs many times before saying this because ...  First, let me say that I am a fan of your secular music so that is far and away my favorite. Daft Punk was a genius piece of music/video. I like Matt and he has a great singing voice but he doesn’t have the bass that Avi has. Because of that I never thought y’all would be able to match Daft Punk in a medley but you did. Fantastic piece of work by everyone involved. The singing was amazing, the arrangement was top notch, the sound and video editing were perfection, and clothing/makeup were on the money.  This was perfection.   Thank you for giving it to us.
I love pentaronix
Everytime we touch😭🔥
I love pentatonix~!!!!!!!!
Mooooore, please the full version.
I could listen to everytime we touch for ever...💃😘
Kalian sudah berumur ya tapi aku tetap suka ... Lagu kalian yang radioactive masih ku ulang²
This brings so many memories!
I think it's the first time i see a human sintetizer
<3 Took me back, wayyy back.  Still remembered every word tho.  :)  WELL done!
Need baby  names
Just  found  out  that  I  am  having  a  family
Lo máximo. Son espectaculares!
Everytime I hear "EVERYBODY DANCE NOW!" I think of the Simpsons episode where homer brings Bart to a steel mill to  make him not gay and the entire mill breaks out singing that song with the flashing disco lights and everything lol.
MATT = CHER FOR THE WIIINNNN!
DO A COVER OF SPACE JAM!!!
I just have one question... when is this gonna be available on spotify?
Wow...just WOW!!!
Their voices are so beautiful together, its amazing!
We can all agree we NEED full versions of EVERY song in this video!
I wanna hear a full cover of 'Believe' so bad I love it
"Everytime we touch" what a masterclass
💚💛💙   Incrível!
Obsessed. That’s it that’s all.
I love all of you!
everytime we touch isn't 90's 🤨
2021 hay un poco de musica en tu edicion
These are also known as all the songs I was forced to listen to in the car while driving to school
Part 2!!!
The best selection of a medley you guys have done💯! I grew up with those songs loving them also if you guys could have done Another Night by Real McCoy that would have been amazing!
Another snapshot video  Christ they need to level up
Je ne sais pas que veut dire le titre, par contre je l'apprécie fort...
Kristin looks so good
Friday night Funkin but real life edition:
👏 Wow!
Almost can not believe that the sound of this music is not a musical instrument, happy to watch videos with Indonesian subtitles, do you want to learn Indonesian ?, start by clicking this vahnnel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjkXqV68S3w&t=164s
Now I have to dig up Sonique's So good... thanks for bringing back the memories
Disappointed that they used Auto-tune in a couple places.  I'm sure it was to be true-ish to the original, but they just don't need it.  It certainly doesn't make them sound better.
Fake voices in my eyes ... ears
#Pentatonix please do a cover of 'Take a chance on me' by #ABBA
Wowwww❤️❤️
These Great ❤️🥰😘
Grausam :D
The Memories! I shaked my Arse to every one of these back in the Day lol
this was amazing! can you guys do a 2000s one next please?!!!
i am still living with Kirstie's Rhythm is a Dancer
Wow. They nailed it. Nice job.
What happened to the og bass voice I know from the daft punk medley? Did he quit at some point?
you must make a Vol 2 of 90s dance!  Be sure to include: Whigfield's Saturday Night, Culture Beat's Mr. Vain, Real McCoy's Another Night, Buckethead's The Bomb and Livin' Joy's Dreamer!!!
❤️
Can appreciate the use for effect on this medley here and there, still wish they’d avoided the auto tune touches.
Every time we touch was released in 2006 what the heck
This is Satan's favorite karaoke band.
😳😱😍🕺💃🥳🥳🥳
Love you  pentatonx  you bring back a beautiful era and nostalgic days ( ❤❤
Idk how I'd missed this .. Also wanna say ... Wardrobe and makeup..AA++
I LOVE THIS AAAAAAAAAA this is so cool everyone looks so awesome I’m so happy
https://youtu.be/3MteSlpxCpo
Will these songs be released in an album? 👀
Um, we didn't dress like that in the 90's LOL
That's it. I'm old. I'm officially old.
Ah childhood right here! Literally all my faves! Exploding with happiness, just beautiful!!! ❤️❤️❤️
<3 I want these songs on a new record #Pentatonix goes 90s <3
Love song hope get most of lucky number from this song.!!!enjoy!!!
You guys should do wellerman!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
nice medley. pure nostalgia.
i was 18 in this era and literally only could stand 2 of the songs and did't recognize 2. And yes all we had was the radio. all these throw backs.. i feel like I missed a whole decade somehow.... or millenilas and old websites are gteting it wrong.
Hey where's the bass go......
А что сдесь делает загримерованный Зеленский с усами.....😂😂😂
Waiting for the next song
A Touch Of Class - Around The World I want to listen to the full version!
Okay....let me come clean....  Momma, I'm obsessed with the sounds of PTX!!!  Like what!!!!!  The sounds, key consistency, beats, craaaazyyy pitches....  Who else is in my boat of understanding
the best cover u guys did ....PERFECT
i was born around the end of '99 [so i'm sorta a 90s kid] but i know/love many of these songs [mostly cuz of memes], are the songs actually from the 90s?  :0
Why is Cascada in here? That's a 2006 song.
Omg, this brings me back to my youth!!
WE WANT FULL VERSION OF EACH SONG
the feeling when every song is a bit different but you actually know all of those is very nice
😁😁😁😁😍😍😍😍 Waaaaaa PTX your song its on 69th Miss Universe right now!!! So proud of you😭😭 and its an Original "Sing"👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 love you guys.😍😍😍😍
I need a full version of Believe!
I swear, my entire life in the 1990s passed before my eyes!
i need the 80s medley!
Brilliant medley. I was a teenager through all the 90’s so I remember all these songs. Any chance you could do one for the 00’s ?
you keep getting better :) thx ! (5 weeks to discover that ? :/ hmmm youtube ! do your job better)
Masterpiece! Omg you are amazing! Thanks for comeback to my 90's youth :)))
This makes me happy!  Love it!  I wish it was longer.
日本人の方いらっしゃいますかー？ww
Happy Birthday Kirstie! I want to wish you a good birthday and spend time with your family, and also, Kevin, Scott, Matt, and Mitch! I love all of you guys!!❤❤❤
Kto z polski be like😂
Please, release the full version of the song "what is love". I really really love it.
Seriously tho!! i know mitch is older than me but dang he is cute!!!
Oh my gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mitch you have a truly amazing voice!!!!!!! Love it, I can listen to it forever!!!
This is amazing💥❤️💥❤️💥❤️💥
❤️👍
I need a full cover of it feels so good
Did the members change??? Where's the old bass guy dammit
Got older..but i still move the same. Aging is just fine..a reality everybody faces someday. But each song has a memory i would not trade for the world. Funny how even that song from Cher sounds good...as long she isn't singing it LOL.
Обожаю) Красавчики!!!
Super cool 🎉
Damn I miss avi
Filete! 👏👏👏
I like their stuff most of the time, but this got me right in the 90s
Love this!!
what happened to the guy with long hair
hi pentatonix i love your videos
Hello, you all are the best accapella I’ve ever heard and I think you like a challenge. I would love to hear you put you’re spin on an older song from the band “Yes” The song is “Leave it” and its loaded with several layers of notes and varying degrees of sounds. Please do this one? Everything you do is incredible so I’d expect the same level of awesomeness.
Amen amen God bless you all right now
Make Eurythmics Sweet Dreams! Please!!
Stop reminding me that I am aged please...  Darn these songs made me feel old. 😪 Great remakes though 👌
Me encantó 💕
ugh
Who else wants to hear the Wellerman by Nathan Evans?
Scott with his aviator swag and then he puts on yellow and pulls out the sass. I can with that justapostion. Too funny.
Full version of all of them
It's crazy how much better Scott and Mitch sound by themselves than P as a whole
Very good
Cascade megamix version is needed
I love the detail of the autotune on Believe
flashback to my life!!!! thanks!!!!
petition for a full version of "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" 💙💙💙
Amazing! Wonderful! I love PENTATONIX! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gay scar face
God I love Pentatonix!
PTX - PTX News ! Just released... YOUR POWER (billie eilish cover) by Mitch Grassi.  His SOLO song, on a roof, gorgeous voice.  Thanks for listening. :)
02:01 mitch voice made me fly
"90s Dance Medley" "Everytime We Touch" Hurm...
I need this in spotify and I'll religiously stream it everyday
That was the time that autotune was used to improve the music by making the voice kinda robotic. Now autotune is used to correct the voice of a singer that doesn't know how to sing right huehuehuehuehuehue
Que show 🤩😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💚💛
Mitch, you are either scar face or other amazing person. It's bofum.
1:45 min so gefeiert als Kind 😅
2:56 i like that
How about Metal? Your mouths are fast enough, any metal! You want to look the beautifulest I want you guys to get 100% and still be beautiful, if you are not beautiful I will come to where you are and cough at you.
Goosebumps...
These goosebumps are making me honk. 💜
Still prefer Daft Punk. That medley was structured and arranged so perfectly. This medley is just song after song and seems to lack the creativity that that made Daft Punk what it was. I think they would have been better off picking few songs and remixing them in a similar creative fashion.
Why there is no Barbie Girl - Aqua?
My whole childhood in one video!!
No Avi, no dice. Sorry, he was just such a unique talent and the group isn’t the same. It’s missing the depth that he brought. I still love all the original members, but listening to the newer music/covers just doesn’t bring me chills like the old stuff does.
is this medley available anywhere??
this video 😍😍😍😍😍
💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥
I'd love to see what they could do with an 80's hair band medley!!!!
Can we get a "without love" from hairspray cover tho?? 🤌
Daaamn! 🔥🔥
Full version of Sonique... Oh my oh my i feel so old!
Full version of be my lover PLEASE!!!
Mitch be looking like Freddy Mercury and I am living for it
This is the best one in a while. Great great work!!!
👌👏💕😉💃🕺🎼🎵🎶🎉🙋🏻‍♀️🇲🇽❤️
I have watched this for almost three days straight! I was Born in 85' and this represents my adolescence! My soul years!! I not only know ever song but have a story for each!! 😭😭🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 You are gorgeous! I have to say everyone shined. Kirsten the look!!! Mitch 😱😱🙌🏽🙌🏽!
Guyyys u need to do a full version of all of them. Sooo good!
Add this on Spotify please !!
This is incredible as always but "Every Time We Touch" was released in 2006...
I love it!
Just awsone guts Well done so well done. It's a share for me. And a share for you.
Eurodance is still alive... 💃💃💃
i like the song after the everytime we touch song? and the believe by cher i remember my 90's childhood ❤️❤️❤️  and the butterfly song i remember it was on thw playstation dance dance revo hahaha
omg im dancing in my room, this was my childhood!
You guys should do The Wellerman (Sea Shanty) song
Do you believe full version!!!
the best songs!
I can’t get enough of them but I’m waiting for a Cher medley. Lord knows they make everything better but I think the Cher medley would be perfection and I could die happy. Lol.
Blueの時、照明も青くしてるあたりかなり好き❤️  The most I like, "Gonna Make You Sweat"👍👍👍
The crazy snowstorm subsequently blink because quince adventitiously note past a psychedelic eyelash. able, adamant kamikaze
It looked like Scott was helping Kevin beatbox during everybody dance now
Scott looks like Doug from the liberty mutual commercial lol 😂 So cool
This is fantastic. Great job.
After listening through about a dozen times, I find this to be a source of pure joy. Thank you. So much raw talent on display. Question 1: who is running the board and producing the mix? It's masterful. I punished my Tannoy reference monitors repeatedly.
Thank you for creating a new playlist for me! ❤️
Take You Dancing by Jason Derulo pls
0:52 one of the best dutch songs Better of alone - Alice Deejay/DJ 1:40 and again dutch Vengaboys
Okay but we need a full version of im Blue
More mix!!! Love it ❣️
👏👏👏👏
records the song (You say)
Pretty disappointing that Pentatonix started using autotune. Wrecks the original core of Pentatonix of making music with just their voices and ability to harmonize. So sad.
OMG oMG OmG!!!!! omg omg omg
When is the tall blonde dude gonna do solo stuff?!he is too good for this kind of music
PERFECCIÓN DE VOCES!!! Los amo! Hi from Mexico
Mitch makes woman fall in love with music... all of them are perfect but Mitch  gives something more perfect ♡
Wow. So much memories..
They really just rickrolled us
'Believe' went harder than it had any right to and you won't hear me complaining about it
REMIX BUT NO COMPUTER IS NEEDED
I'm gonna need a full version of Believe. What a fuckin masterpiece
Can you do a version of "Burning pile" or "Heather" please? 👉👈
I love Kristin’s hair like that! It looks so beautiful!
This is absolutely amazing! <3
Can you make full cover for Believe by Cher?
So amazing! 🤩 I can't wait to see u in Poland next year 🇵🇱
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who sings bass?
YES!!!! You 5 rock every genre!!!
Why was Mitch dressed like Scarface for a little while?
More Cher please 🙏🙏🙏🙏😘😘😘
What's song 2:16???
I KNOW this is a medley...but I would LOVE to hear them do full versions of all of these songs. Hate me if I'm wrong.
This has really improved my memories of 90s music.
❤️❤️❤️❤️ I like that time.
Eiffel 65 Blue.....I still hear, I'm blue if I was green I would die😂😂
Wtf is happened to this guys!?!
"Everybody dance now" was pure joy and rising of every neck hair I''ve ever had!
Amazing like all the time💕💕🥰💐💐💐

Gente conheço todas. Será que tô velha ??? Kkkk
2:56 Mitch’s voice singing I’m blue gives me shivers up my spine he has a voice of an Angel so does Kirstin all of them are amazing 😊😊😊😊👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Avi... 😔😔😔😭
Ok, isn't anybody gonna praise the magic that is this 1:39 - 2:13 part? #FullVersionPlease
Sorry but Kirstin is unfortunately just a caricature of herself - thanks to the "cosmetic surgeons"
Would love to see them do an 80s dance medley video.
They need to do the same with an 80's mix. Or just cover the song Footloose. Either way, I'd be happy.
皆のこと見たいのにカースティンの口角が上がるの期待してずっと追っちゃうな
the fact im seeing most these in august :)
The fits in thisss
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
uffff, So many memories!!! Thanks!!!
wish I could put more likes🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WOW 🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥 m js speechless
Awesome Voices, great Actors...unbelievable!!! I felt, like I was transported back to my childhood.
yahhhhhhhhhhhh hamusi vanhu vekutamba navo
They should also do a full version of chers song
Please make this an album. I would definitely buy it. It's just amazing, what a trip down memory lane. ❤️
Lovely Medley. However I'm missing Dr.Alban from this.
It's EVERYTHING!
سیبیل نزار
I listen to this every day.  Is it just me
That transition from everytime we touch to blue...wow. I need full versions of both these pls
Now I need '00s Medley with: Hips Don't Lie, Toxic, Yeah!, Don't Stop The Music, I Gotta Feeling, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Hot in Here, Crazy in Love, SexyBack, Whenever, Wherever
Just wow just wow
So proud to be italian when I see someone from the other side of the world singing "Blue" from Eifell 65!
THE AUTOTUNE FOR CHER HAHAHAHA I SCREAMED
Makes me want a 90's R&B Medley next
90s electronic dance songs were a thousand times more catchy than any music made today !!
I really loved Pentatonix, watched them since the very beginning. The pureness of them singing acapella. But lately, all those completely overproduced songs where even Mitch heavenly voice is devoid of the soul it had... Nah, this is just a soulless wall of sound for me. Hopefully I 'll experience this live some day because this doesn't cut it. Talking about cutting...they should cut it with the post-production, autotuning, echoing effects to make everything 'perfect'. They don't need it.
I've recognized every single song...My Youth...Thank u very much, love u :-)
Damn this is goooood
What type of singing are this called?
Petition to put this on Spotify!!!😍😍
Mitch is on fire in this!! His voice 🔥❤
I can't stop watching and dancing!!!!!!love from Kenya!!!!!!!
This medley is so amazing, so fantastic and so beautiful!!! I love this medley so much !!! I love you guys so much !!!
Kirsti looks killer in this! They all do as a matter of fact! Need more of this! When it was over: me- What? NO! I want more! These guys are singing better than the originals. Voices sooo rich! Thank You PTX for sharing you're epic talent with us!
Rhythm is a Dancer !!!
Zajekurwabiste
What a great throwback!! Ahhhh!!
The people who disliked this are Gen Z
2:14 my favorite
90s Kids like this SOOOOOOOO MUUUUCCCCCHHHHHH!!!!
wow these came out in 90s but being a 2004 kid I still grew up with all this amazing music and I'm so glad I did.
Please Haddaway - What Is Love in full version!
Hi guys love your talent, please consider to make extend version
Why is this not on spotify?!!! 😭💔
Has she had her lips done?
wasn't a 90s baby but obsessed !!!!!!!
Next: HOPELESS DEVOTED TO YOU
It's the parapapapapa for me🕺
PLS MAKE A FULL COVER ON BELIEVE AND EVERYTIME WE TOUCH 😩🙌
nice nostalgia feel. thank you
Props for Eiffel 65. Kinda sad no Ace of Base tho. Still a decent mix. More late 90's than old school.
Remember back on the Sing-Off when PTX was working on Cher's song Believe for Guilty Pleasures Week?  They couldn't get the arrangement to work at the time so they switched to Video Killed The Radio Star?  How cool that they returned to that song!
Chics hair cut is ugly
2:56   Leonardo DiCaprio on drool phase (from Wolf of Wall Street) dancing to this song.  😂😂😂😂
Amazing
Do a full version of everybody dance now
Maldonado's smirk in Everytime We Touch tho!!❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)" and "Show Me Love" need to be singles pls 🤗
I watch this video so many times its sad lol, but it never gets old.. BTW I don't know how in the hell this video got 2k dislikes but what ever let the haters hate..
The best musics 90's🤩
God my era I love this, so many good memories of my youth. The world of clubland, miss it so much xx
0:37 о, и Руки Вверх тут )))
i guess kirsty is black now
❤❤❤
Mega Geil Nur Leider Viellllll Zu Kurtz ;)
Over 70, so don't love all the songs, but love the group. It is fun wondering what Kirstie and Mitch are going to look like in the next video.
I loved every second of this video 🔥🔥
I need a whole album of the full versions of these songs, didn't even know I needed this in my life, but now I do
I only really know these songs cause some of them were in a night at the Roxbury and i watched that religiously as a 5 year old with my mom
Ну...мы ждём!
You guys just make me so happy. 😄 Thank you
On the boom boom boom boom part a thought the all were there second version also did anyone notice on Scott’s second time singing at 3:22 Kristen monolodo has a third version
Молодцы. У меня упала челюсть.

i guarantee i’m at least a million of these views..
Aahhh this was so good! I want a part 2 :D
Well! I honestly thought PTX broke up a while back. That's what I heard at least. Glad to see they are still around! Love their work!
só acho que musique cascada foi bem representado kkkk
this video got me back into pentatonix and im so happy it did :') i saw it in my recommended vids on youtube and ive been binge watching all their videos since
Is there an 80s dance songs medley somewhere?
I could listen to Mitch sing "la da de la da dow"for ever
Just got chills! Give me the music!  🎶🎶🎶 Serious 90s nostalgia
love the 90s!!!!!!! best song are from the 90s
Listening to this and knowing that Everytime we touch is not 90s.
Amazing one ! Makes me feel so nostalgic ❤️
Petition for pentatonix Do a  part 2!
I would love you to cover a Muse song <3
WAITING FOR TONIGHT BY THE QUEEN 👏👏👏👏
So perfect
Hello everyone ! I ' m from Brazil! I hear it every time is so good !
🤩
This is great but I can't believe you didn't do Rhythm of the Night.
And please cher believe too and da boo dee im blue
I think we need to see Scott's glasses more often. I loved the extra drama he had with them on.
Better off alone 😫damnn i wanna hear the full version
I want a whole cover on believe 🤤
Muito bom. Parabéns 👏
Heu... I do not recognise the female singer !! And where is the handsome man with a charming low voice with long hair ??? He was my favourite 😍
Perfeito!
Kirstin is so so pretty!
Súper😍
Ptx offical.  I liked music
MY CHILDHOOD
Los mejores. Me ponen los pelos de punta siempre...los adoro!
If I have some friends who could do bit box and who can harmonize 😆 it'll be amazing
you guys so awesome ! you make me cry but from good reasons ! the nostalgy... every song here is just like an arrow to my heart.. reminds me my older brother who died in the army.. he was a very talented keyboard player, and every song here is from his lifetime.. he died in 2000 .. so .. thanks for the nostalgy !
Is it just me or Christie ruined her lips, hair and everything. Same beautiful voice, but the rest is just so bad...
This is brilliant!
great
Low key, they have the swagger and they amaze me everytime. Favorite Acapella group of all time for me
Amazing!
I've never been so cringingly happy to hear Everytime We Touch again.
zwy
DIOOOS! AMÉN SUS LENTES DE SOL!
As a man with an embarrassing number of these in a 90s house playlist,  it's missing Everybody Everybody and Mr Vain.
Great job guys, a lot of good memories.
I want an album with each of these songs in full please 🙏
I may have gone down a 90s dance rabbit hole after watching this. But “Everytime We Touch” was released in 2005. That’s the only one I don’t get being in a 90s dance medley.
The Kirstin I saw on the Sing Off, and the Kirstin of today are two completely different people.  What she needs is a few more tatoos, maybe one on her cheek.  And a few more sessions in the tanning bed.
Will Pentatonix ever sing a BENEE song? We'll find out in another episode
Petition to have them do full versions of like every song 🤣🤣
I want LAMBADA
Is the full tracks available on cd ? This is brilliant...if not get it out on cd
I am so old! I am just sitting here jammin!
So you sang over there songs so what!! basically mimed the whole way through.
Woooow woooooooooooow 🙏
TALENT✨  Dude imagine them doing a cover to Dynamite by BTS🤭
1:38 eternal serotonin
Omg Scott's run at 3:31
Can someone tell me the name of the starting song (Arrraaariraaa raaa raaa) please!
why isnt this a song out on itunes best of the 90's music together
like si NO sbaes ingles:v
I don’t now why but you guy’s are real music not like some rappers who sings about guns drügs and death it’s just not music but hey poeple have rights to sing whatever they won’t
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💙💙💙💙💙💙♾
1.9k dislikes... To those behind it, what's your purpose in life?
CASCADA ISN’T 90S
AWESOME
awesome! WOW
Yeah, this was amazing. I'd love full versions of each of these songs but let me just throw it out to the universe: PENTATONIX DOES C+C MUSIC FACTORY. Thank you.
Outstanding!
Anyone else mesmerized & slightly unsettled by the vocal technique starting at 1:52 for the intro to "It Feels So Good"?? 😳
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 love 90-80
1. Love this very much 2. This is not all 90s..... you mixed with early 2000s
Rupaul entered the chat
Hi. Where can I buy the Sun glasses?
Nice!  And Scott's sunglasses!
See I can’t take this seriously. For one the clothes are not all 90s. For example one guy is wearing a shirt whose collar pegs it as from the 70s. Another is dressed like George Michael circa 1987’s Faith. Then they incorporate Cascade’s “Everytime we Touch,” which was released in 2005. Come on guys. Y’all have the knowledge to avoid mistakes like this. It just seems sloppy and amateur.
por qué nadie habla de lo robóticas que se escuchan las voces de los ptx?
AWESOME
​Баллада о солдате... https://youtu.be/yehBkHZyy2Q
PTX is the best acapella group! they sound so good
Extraordinary!
The beginning is just next fucking level!!!
There is somebody missing?! Did the best singer leave?
Who else is looking at them and see how much they have changed
Same super piosenki. Extra połączenie więcej takich 🤩👌
You are super! Mitch I love you❤️
Full 90’s album please!!
Petition for full version of all these!
Kirstin and Mitch only changed their looks like 10 times
Jesus wants to save you people. Peace and love
SOY DE PERU LOS AMOOOOOO
I think you guys should do the hole song of do you believe in love after love
They are all so beautiful!
💗💞💐🌹🌸😍😍🌼 amando , lembrando minha infância 💗
I forgot how good 90s dance music is!
This 90's kid is happy ☺️☺️
I like the Sher's song strong enough, god job guys
90's music is the best!!!!
EU ACHANDO Q ERA A BANDA UÓ 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Wow
Boom boom I want a double boom
This girls reminds me Anitta
Sonique- it feels so good COMPLETE PLEASE 🇦🇷🇦🇷
Scott’s version of Show Me Love is stunning
Ok let's be honest here, most of the comments say this is like a throwback and actually for me this is my everyday playlist
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍Exelent
PLEASE DO MORE.
The best person in this team is the sound engineer who mixed your voices in this quality...
Can we appreciate how neat they all look?
Amazing!!!
I love this. It's perfect. 💖
Some music from the old continent? Awesome. Thank you
Me encanta!!! Espectacular!!!!
So many memories

all i have to say is i absolutely LOVE the everytime we touch part, can we get a full version???
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Please full version of Beautiful life...
OMG
I loved it, but you can hear that it isn't acapella anymore. I can hear the piano/keyboard and the bass guitar, as well as the voice altering thing. Still love Pentatonix.
I want a whole It Feels So Good cover. Y'all sound So good on that.
Did they change the female singer
YASS! THANK YOU!
The 1.9k who gave this a thumbs down were born in the 2000’s.
im blue dabadidabadidabe see everthing blue windos blue picturs i love ptxofficial
Espetáculo
Goosebumps....
Am I the only one a little disappointed by the use of auto-tune in this medley?
Should try some of the game track songs
They are getting better and better but sexuality is cramping them. Love not lust is the way. Love will find a way. Love is the answer. Attachments and appearances are restrictions that cloud what love can do and take away freedom.
I need full versions of Everytime we touch, I'm Blue, and Believe k thanks!
Great songs of a great decade reinterpreted in a great way.
I wish they release it on Spotify ,so I can play it OnRepeat all the time .
Just need a full version of “everytime we touch”
Wicked good. Have loved you guys since you did the Daft punk video. Beautiful voices and beatbox. Thank you for enriching my life.
I used to be a big fan. I haven’t watched y’all in a while. someone tell me what happened to kevin?
90s have the best songs ever made in human history!
Super effects n so good👍

I really wish i could spent some time with these genius minds while they figure out how to create the different levels of a song and how they record it. I have so much respect of this amount of work they put in every song and medley. Thanks PTX :)
why is this not on spotify, i need it on repeat
yoooo imagine if they did a cover of blinding lights that'd be so amazing but in all honesty can we get a full album of 90's covers please because i'd buy the heck out of it
Everytime we Touch was released in 2006 but alright
Cool, love the harmonies, beatbox and pure voice /vocal talent and taking me back lol

I've always liked Pentatonix but after repeatedly listening to The Lucky Ones and seeing this I can officially say I STAN. Also they're all so amazingly talented but my ears crave Mitch's voice, I can't even ya'll-
this is so good in so many ways
I mean all the songs they covered were great but their version of Cher's  Believe just hits different🙌
В 90-х я слушал the Prodigy , а не эту попсню лоховскую )

Just wow, full versions of these songs please
Kevin the background you do is impressive
This Performance was amazing, I am obsessed with this medley!! Kevin and Matt are so great singers, Kristin is so beautiful and she has a great voice and she is talented! Mitch and Scott, they're amazing, They're so funny, Talented and Great Performers! I Love Pentatonix! But I am Missing Avi! I Love You so much, guys!
Here's another question  Can we sometime get the raw video on some of these? Seriously everyone is just into the music and it is just PUUUUR-FECT
VIDEO FANS LOVE
Would y’all like a full time captioner? Even for music it is so helpful for people (D/HoH or not). I volunteer!
Someone needs to lay off the surgeries..but anyway, they sound so dope
the believe partttttt i sang so hard!
Can you guys cover EXO's song TEMPO acapela part?
I love so much about this. They all have a own ~style~ and then their singing together is just <3 Yes. I feel almost bad for wanting complete covers of every song. I love originals. But they would be that one band that make the cover better.
I got my very 1st mini van and 2 beautiful babies during the 90s.  I was actually listening to these songs on the radio with 2 sweet boys in their car seats!! Crazy how fast time goes by........ .Remember that folks
This is awesome
If possible, could you guys do a sea shanty melody?
So relaxing. Nice mush up
Be my Lover omg that beat! Why so short Q_Q oh Vengaboys :D I'M BLUE my favorite Song forever! I need like a full version of all Songs please. :D
I guess I'm done with Pentatonix.
This was amazing. I would also add that I would love to hear a 90s hip hop/R&B medley.
If they did a whole album of these songs sang in full I would buy it. Reminds me of my childhood. Thanks for this, guy's.
Mitch's voice is so unique
Petition for PTX to do a more complex version of “I’m Blue (Da Ba Dee)” with ‘robot voice editing’ allowed?
KOCHAM UWIELBIAM 🌈💜🌈💜👏

Can I find it on Spotify?
Love,love ,love you😍
Nope. I can´t do this. It is good that the 90s are over. But the voices are brilliant as ever.
I’m getting Freddie Mercury vibes from Mitch 🤔 it’s the tash!
Wow!!! Amazing, go back to my childhood.  Nice compilation, the Best i ever heard.
Amazing!!!
Made my day on shift at the hospital. Niceeeeee!!!!
Where is a "Jesus"?  Куда делся товарищ похожий на Иисуса?
Oh the good ole days of dancing in the bars for hours!  Bar None, Vancouver!!!
Now THATS what I call MUSIC!
Very seamless transition between songs. As a fan of 90s dance music, this was very enjoyable, you had my feet tapping. The thanks of many👍
TOP compilation - perfectly selected songs, performance at a high level. I can't detach myself from this compilation. SUPER
Absolutely love this!!!! Can listen to this all day.  Thanks guys! Great job!
"Boom Boom Boom Boom"- Fulll Version, pleeeease
一言言わせてください  最高です
I'm not the hugest Mitch fan, but his voice is undeniable.  I just hate when they autotune him, because he's honestly too good for that.  And I get that they were young when this all started... but watching the physical changes Kirstin has gone through... she was so beautiful to begin with, why continue to play with it?  I still love this group and their talent.  Gotta echo some of the calls for other 90s songs!
She is so beautiful
waiting for an 80´s medley to drop.
As a 90s baby.... I VERY much approve.... As always😆🤷🏻‍♀️ Always beautiful music!🙏🏻

Please do Stand up by Cynthia Erivo.
Some songs are better then the originals...awesome
They are great, I admire them a lot, please do more cover like this 😊😊😊
This is amazinggg😍😍
90's Dance Medley huh? Your lack of Faithless - Insomnia is disturbing! But then again there wasn't much in the form of singing in that song, but the song is iconic nonetheless!
Вау хиты моей молодости.
good
YES!!!! We need a resurgence of Cascada!!! Do all of them. All of them. I listen to her literally everyday driving to and from work as a few of her songs are on my "drive to work" playlist. Lol! I got to see her live when I was 19 (legal drinking age is 18 here). That show gave me life!!! Lol
Jesus....don’t want this video to end..... extremly cool
Omg best cover of Cher!!!!

Holy crap, this is epic!
INCREDIBLE
They look like they smell sooo good
0:38 brings back memories from the "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"
Magnifique. Inmense. Impressive.
Full version album, instabuy.
Genteeeeeee que lindo que ficou❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ PTX são os meus favoritos 😁
Many of my DJ friends agree that they should have done a covers album of all the tracks they have included in the mix. The mix itself is amazing and to hear some of these 90s hits again brings back many memories.......
Очень круто! 🙌 Талантища. Вы лучше оригиналов
А*уенно товарищи👍🙌👏
rambut nya potong gori keren jg
I'm backkkkk after some years.
Petition for full version of "Believe"
Sound like time travel 😄😄😄
This is dope!!!'🎊 🎉 🍾......thank you so much for this one 🙂
2:55 just repeating this crazy sound already 1 hour i guess)
Wow. Just. Wow.
Any chance of an 80s medley ?
You are ALL stars, but I am SO _crushing_ on Kirstin in this;  You sound  —and look—  delicious.   Honey for my ears, eyes …and a few other organs.   Keep killing it, Kids!   (Miss you, Avi)
Some of these are '00 tho 🙄
I'm sorry fans there is a problem with this... they have set the bar very high . they will now to keep producing this level of production and that will impact all our lives as we'll spend so much more time here bahahaha
I want every one of these as individual, full length songs!!! Aaaaargh!
Not as good as when avi was still there
90'S kid it's our time to shine ❤️❤️❤️
I loved it so much. It would be so cool if there were videos of each of these songs, I enjoyed them so much.
I'd like to hear a ptx version of Imogen heap - hide and seek.
I love the ptx songs... More.... More.... Mooorrreee.... ❤️
Nostalgia 😭
My favorite singer 😍
We all need a full version of « Believe » and « All around the world » !
I like all these songs in Nightcore versions😁😄
80's please!
Is there any little chance this amazing medley will be on spotify?
Petition for a full version of each song please! :D
I love Mitch without the mustache
0:37 this part sounds so familiar with ava max my head my heart. Till 0:52
Incroyable 🔥
Can you remake the full version of these songs?
Pentatonix is my favorite
You are such a talented bunch of vocalist that I can't tell if you actually used an auto-tuner to replicate the auto-tuned sound of Cher's Believe, or if you somehow managed to replicated it with your voices.
Its toooooooo nice, good job guys🥰🥰🥰
Seriously want an album of these as full songs!
Eu simplesmente AMEEEEIIII😍😍
annyira jóóó :) <3
We NEED ABBA Pentatonix ♡♡♡♡♡
And then Kevin , I think he was feeling this one
Mitch's voice just ties everything in together   Like if you agree
rhythm is a dancer. pls
Muito loko...razoooo😍
Salute to the beatboxer👌
Petition for all songs have a full version. :D
I love Pentatonix, but this has the most artificially produced sound I have heard.  Can producers just stop trying to make things sound so effing artificial? You guys are naturally talented, no need for all the false production. Your outtakes of ye're earlier self-taped stuff sounds better than this!
You should do wellerman(sea shanty)
You should do wellerman(sea shanty)
Like it!!awesome compilation👏👏

Priscilla Queen of the Desert at t' end. Loved It
Bravo bravíssimo Clarice Brasil

"it feels so good" please full versión I need it Amazing cover Best of best ever
Mitch on a loop all freaking day at :29s 😍😍😍😍💃🏻
Their harmonies are always super on point, unfortunately their combination of voices just doesn't work for me.
I would love to see a "making of" explanation of how this video was crafted during quarantine.  Each member is presumably recording from separate studios.  I guess they do the audio first, then come back and shoot the video portion at least twice to accommodate the wardrobe changes, then technicians spend hundreds of hours piecing this all together.
Someone knows if it is available on spotty cause I can’t find it , help!
all of these petitions for specific songs, but no petition for full versions of all of em?! um yes please
PTX is like fine wine. They get better and better with age
ty so much
"That's What Takes Me High." That was one of my favorites!
洗濯干す時に流してる。笑 毎回ノリノリ。笑
Would love to hear an 80's mix. Brilliant as always, love this group 💜
It's like hearing my first mp3 player tracklist, what a huge nostalgia trip 💜
2:40 keinget lagu dangdut indo dong 😂
You just make every song sound so much better!!
Love this 90s mix! Need to do each one as a song on it's own!
Great!
Faltou muito sucesso aí no meio Ann Lee (whigfield), playahitty, Jenny B e Sandy Chambers (Corona), Scatman John, Alexia...

OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!  Completamente apaixonada!! Que vozes incríveis, que perfeição!!!

Oh my goodness, this is the greatest thing I have ever heard. As a 90s kid, this was magical.
Dizer que já ouvi muito. Muitíssimo cada uma dessas lindas músicas... É  dessa forma todas em um rit ficou incrível. Parabéns 💖💖

This video lacks of Avi' bass.. Damn.
Give me a whole Pentatonix Cher cover album kthanks.
Ребята сделайте пожалуйста что нибудь из русской музыки!!!
We need full version for "everytime we touch.. PLEASE
The other four members of Pentatonix: “We are going to do a 90s dance medley.”  Kevin: (sweating profusely)“We’re going to what?!”
Bravissimi 👏
They make this sound better but being a child of the nineties, you realize that the downfall of good taste in pop music kinda started from this decade. Forgive us children of the 2000s. It was our fault.
this is great!! Well done PTX! This would be insane if it was an album. Every song would be so good!
God this brought me back. I miss the roller skating rink.
2.15 cinta satu malam wkwk
When is the release on Amazon? I love this!!
It's so great, thanks for such a great pleasure. You are like a good wine, with years becoming better and better.
more please!!!
Какие вы классные! Вас слушать доставляет эстетическое наслаждение! Бравоооо! 👏👏👏👏👏💗💗💗💗💗💗
Omg... 😍
Cascada is not '90's, it's only just that nineties kids may remember this hit best. Not to say something ugly tho, PENTATONIX is such a great and talented bunch of people.
最高以外の言葉が浮かばない
Why does mitch look like freddy mercury?
I want project with Alex Christensen ❤️
♥️♥️
Amazing, only criticism is that it lacks “Mr Vain”. Other than that, perfect
You guys are amazing and should totally do a Tina Turner medley!!!
Omg I think this is my favorite mashup.... Amazing... Kirsten I love your hair... Absolutely beautiful... Love you guys.. I actually voted for you guys  on the sing off... I knew from the first time y'all sang you'd win... Loved Shawn's reaction of you guys....
You guys are so beautiful.  Love to you all!
Everytime We Touch was my favorite, I wish for a full version! 😭👌
This feels less like a cohesive medley and more like a series of clips. It's a shame because they're all so talented and the editing goes above and beyond.
So auto tuned
They've only gotten better with time..
WoW, todas genial, pero la de Sonique me ha traído muy buenos recuerdos 💜
Freddy Mercury incarnate
Where Is Gigi D'Agostino???
I hope I get a chance to see them live one day ❤️
Can this be on spotify...k thanks
*THAT TINYYY SNIPPET OF “GYPSY WOMAN”—*
❤️
SONIQUE IT FEELS SO GOOD. OMG IM DYING. my teenage years in just 5:43 minutes
Omg to cool👍🏽👏🏽😄
Y'all had me panicking that Every Time We Touch was much older than I remember 😰 (it's from 2006)
Thank You Amigo s  🤣😂😘🤩😍🥳😎👻🥰💋💌💘
Growing up in a medley lol.
AMAZINGGG I LOVE IT
Wonderful 👌
👌👍🌝😇

WTF happened to Kirstin's lips?!? LOL
It’s so fun!
I could hear Mitch singing the “parapapara” all day long
just waiting for this to drop on Spotify so I can replay it over and over and over again
The memories have came floodin back, the 90's were the best, thank you pentatonix
I LOVE IT  😍😍
Love it💙💚👍
Believe! Crystal Waters! Finally! This is great!
WHEN IT WENT TO BLUE! DANGGG
So cool, kisses from Brazil, Love you!!!!!!
Hello from Russia-everything is super
I'm so sorry, but the guy wearing a women's blazer while sporting a teenager's mustache is such a strange combination to me. I'm all for being yourself and choosing your sexuality, but damn...I can't be the only one feeling a little uneasy with that choice?
DO A HAMILTON MEDLEY :D
Genuine!
Thank you for Cher ❤
but Cascada isn't 90"s I google it and its from 2006
When you realize the volume only goes up so high.
Спасибо за ваше творчество! Спасибо за ностальгические нотки!. Вы восхитительная команда! (только русского не хватает). шутка..
OMG Eurodance!!!!!!
Os melhores mano 😍
Just wanna say I was the 4 millionth viewer.... I think.
0:28 song pls
insuperable
La Bouche was another level I need the whole song
Too autotuned
So enjoyable. There is a high degree of musical talent on display here obviously. But it would be so much better if Scott Hoying would just sing out rather than doing that 90s boy band thing with the quivering lips
235,799 people of 19 mil is 90's kids
que hermoso canta
Это шикарно😍😍😍
Visual production 👌🏿💯🔥
I miss the days when they just sat on a couch and sang..
I want a full version of Finally
If you were to die today, are you a 100% sure you will go to heaven?   If no, here is what the bible says, (1) Romans 3:23 KJV [23] For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. Q1. Do you know what Sin is?   Sin is anything bad that we have done.  Q2. Have you sinned before?   Yes or No?  (2) Revelation 21:8 KJV [8] But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Because they have sinned, and God does not allow Sin into Heaven, the punishment is burning hell.   What is the way to reconcile our peace and relationship with God?  Q3. Do you know the Story of Jesus?  (3) Romans 5:8 KJV [8] But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  Jesus = God who lived up in Heaven, but he came down on earth and became a man like us, he lived for 33.5 years without committing any sin. Then there were certain people who were jealous and therefore framed him on phony charges, and crucified him. Then he was buried and resurrected on the third day; Now he lives in HEAVEN.   Q4. Do you know why Jesus went through all this bloody mess for us?  A4. As mentioned, our sin is the reason why we can’t go to heaven, and the only thing that can wash away our sin is the Blood of Jesus.  (4) Romans 5:9 KJV [9] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  According to the bible, the only way for us to reconcile with God is through Christ Jesus’s blood, and not through any works that we do or merits we accumulate, such as water baptism, attending church, or any good thing that we do. The following  verses clearly support this.  (5) Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV [8] For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.  (6) 2 Corinthians 7:10 KJV [10] For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.  In order to get saved, repentance of one’s sin is needed to get saved, we need to be sorry, and repent, with conviction, that we are a wretched sinner.  (7) Romans 10:9 KJV [9] That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  If you truly do  believe in everything you have heard in the gospel,  ,I  strongly suggest you to make a proclamation to GOD! You can say it to God in less than 15 seconds !Repeat after this simple prayer, to make sure you  truly get saved. Remember repeating this prayer doesn't save you, it's you telling God you BELIEVE THE GOSPEL. Ok, here is the prayer :  ‘Dear GOD, I know I am a sinner, as I repent, I put my faith, that Jesus is GOD, and that he died, buried and resurrected, so that his blood, can wash away my Sins. I put my faith in that alone to save me, not my good works. In Jesus’s holy name, I pray. Amen!   ‘Congratulations ! Now you are a child of God. Download /Buy a KJV bible, and search for youtube channels like  Truthunedited, REAL Bible  Believers , The Bible Project, AoC Network, The Chosen,  Spencer Smith, Revelations of Jesus Christ to help you grow , study dispensationalism to understand the bible (I recommend the dispensationalism video from Genesis to Revelations by Dr. Gene Kim, https://youtu.be/GI4CteEFxOk) , join a bible  believing church. God bless you brother/ sister ☺. See you in heaven one day!  Please help share the gospel, feeel free to copy and paste this
I hope the only reason that Rhythm of the Night isn’t here is because a full version is on the way
I wish They added Another Night, Barbie Girl, Gotta Get Through This, I DJ with The Fire, Cotton-Eyed Joe, More and More, UHF, Floor Filler, Upside-Down(Bouncing Off The Ceiling), I Like it Like That, Who Let The Dogs Out Remix, Move it like This, I’m The ScatMan, Born  to be My Baby, I just Died in Your Arms, Talking in Your Sleep, Dream Warriors, Somebody’s Watching Me, Never Gonna Give You Up, Locomotion, The Final Countdown, etc.!❤️📺🎶👍🏻
I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS
Why is Scott dressed like Leorio from HXH
❤️❤️❤️😱😱😱 love the nineties!! Miss the clubs in NYC 😭😭 PTX IS OTHER WORLDLY 👏👏
Amazing!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Funny: Was rewatching their Sing Off "Video Killed the Radio Star" and they switched songs from Cher's "Believe" cuz it "wasn't working." I guess they figured out a way to make it work =)
0:53 i can see the hamster
i know all
Please, do a cover of "every time we touch" and "blue" individually 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Is this on iTunes? I’m desperate to jam to this in the car.
I listen to this so many times I can sing those songs in the right order
WOW! amazing! :O
I miss Avi Kaplan. It would be nice if he rarely appeared.
Can we have a full song for each please???
[OFFICIAL VIDEO] Everytime We Touch - Pentatonix  Gonna wait my notification for this 😅❤
Please do a full version of just be my lover 😍😍😍😍
I would love full version of the songs used in this
Вы просто 💣❤️🥰🌸🌸🌸 любим Вас
Perfect flashback. Thank you!
I can listen to this all day
だいすき🤍
Is mitch in fact a bad guy / informant in some kind of early 90s wizard detective movie.....I remember him on the sing off and I get excited every time I see how he has continued to explore himself and his personality  P.s. I now believe mitch could have intro'd nearly 87% of dance songs from 92 to 97....like dont pay for that extra studio time just have mitch do it on your answering machine it will work just fine
Still upset none of the medleys are streamable
around the world full version when?
Как же круто!
Amazing
this deserves a billion views guys, let's stream and support their videos!
I was born in 92, but it's wonderful 😍 I know every song, and I would listen to every song in its entirety, performed by you. 🎉🎉🎉
Omg i love it
Can we have a full version of Believe by Cher?!! OMG you guys are amazing!
Kirstin in Everytime We Touch is everything!!!
Full version of believe plzzz!!! 🥺🥺❤❤❤
Waiting for 80s medley???
Oh, this hits the nostalgic spot so hard. I would kill to hear them sing No Mercy's "Where Do You Go" as that's my favorite '90s dance song.
😝😝
Scott's hair is awesome.
I lived thru the 90s so I thought this would be cool but the over use of autotune here made me unable to finish watching 😖
OMG! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT😱 I want more...plz!🙏 Sooo sooo awesome!!!🤩🥰🥰
Superfruit cameo at 1:29 :D
i need full versions of every one of these songs please. These songs were some of my favorites back then. Thank you. <3
Whenever the 2000's version of this medley comes out, I better hear Cotton Eye Joe, Cha Cha Slide, and Macarena because that's all that popped up at my school dances.
Thank God there are still talented singers like this in the world.   Just jaw dropping.
BR???????
The first song! I remember when I was younger and they played at the big e in western mass and my dad got backstage passes! So amazing! Gosh I miss those good times.
History hagan por favor, De one directions y Fools gold de la misma banda tambien
My musical taste in one video omg
Scott is literally so beautiful. I love how serious he always looks on these videos.
Que estresante que siempre cante el mismo
They should have included "I like to move it".
Varied and stellar selection of songs! Awesomely performed! You made a 90's teenager happy :D
😦 ... omg This makes me feel things. 🔥🥵
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Art!!!!!🎧🎼
James Corden is that you ?
This is an awesome revival 🔥🔥 like hearing the songs for the first time again
Soooo... When are the brothers gonna sing a line?
Wow, I haven’t watched them in YEARSSS and wow they have changed so much!
It’s almost all Eurodance... man we did it in the 90 😂
Petition for full version of Cher's "believe"!
Blue Eiffel65 🇮🇹❤️ tnx guys!
That was epic, favourite bit Cher - Believe (right tune and perfect example of how autotune should be used, not like how it's used today), also now 90's dance track is complete without Eiffel 65 - Blue ;)
OMG IS BEATIFUL
im sorry was that kristin or cascada absolutely slaying everytime we touch?!
3 of them should’ve whipped out raptor costumes for the “Finally” part of the song. #Priscilla
Cinta satu malam oh indahnya cinta satu malam buatku melayang. Walau satu malam akan ku kenang dalam hidupku. 😂
I want full version of Show Me Love, Rhythm is a Dancer and Around The World (La La La La)!
Amazing songs
The lip filler is getting ridiculous though.

Love this!!! ❤❤❤❤
I would love the full Sonique track, always amazing
Can we get 70s and 80s dance medley??? 😅
Beautifully done, wow! Took me back! Excellent sounds!

This is the best one! So nostalgic!!!!
Mitch's voice <3
Me encanta 😍
i just noticed... how this feels like i'm listening to popdanthology but it's acapella...
Most singers need Autotune. Autotune itself needs Matt.
О. Мой. Бог. 👍
thanks for this tribute!!! it was a incredible musical time, you have made me relive a great moment of my life..
SO GAY LOVE IT !!!!!
Matt wearing red gives me strange feels.  I like
I'm sorry, I'm new to this group. But I remember a bearded guy being there in the older videos. 😐
I want to buy this song on Amazon Music, but I can't find it!! 😩 Album coming soon????
Superb!!! 🙌🙌🙌
4:28 waited 10 years to hear PTX rendition of Believe, (sing off), Fans since 2011 singoff will relate
Around The World came out in 2000.
I need a 1hr version of this lol
All of these songs could be amazing as full arrangements. Really like Kirstin’s “Rhythm is a dancer.” Spectacular job guys! (80s & 90s had the best music).
Kirsten really shines in this.
From Philippines I really love all your Covers Music ❤️
GOOD...................^_^
Is there an 80's medley??
We all know these songs even if we dont really know these songs

Fantastic!!!
Mitch to play a young Joe Exotic in a Tiger King Biopic
i   Guay      !
This is amazing,  the 90s are back for sure, you best get your platforms and bootcut or flares out the closet. I'm 20 years older this time round though.  Ffs lol. The 90s was pure brilliant in the clubs, I never forgot it. Hello from Ireland.  I hope this goes to number  1 around the world.  Yes boi
I loved you too much
You guys are wonderful!!!! Come to Brazil 🇧🇷 will be very welcome..... 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘
WOW Pentatonix... u honestly brought me back in time😭 I love u and salute u guys, u are the best👍🏻😎❤️
I need full version of better of alone
I really hope this is a taste of what their next album is going to contain.
I want any one of these tunes in there full version please
❤️90's
Ok but the fashion in the whole video😵 on point
Lookin like Tiger King got out of prison.
Now I want them to sing the whole song's that they did in this video. Loved it!!!!❤
Love it! Hope you could also do Backstreet Boys Medley or 90's boyband medley😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
What... no rhythm of the night?  Or some know it as "is it rebok or the nike"
One of the best music videos I have seen! I thing before 2012 is the golden area for entertainment! I was born in the 90's! I love your music!Keep doing what you love!
u should do a melody of 90's slow jams...  like boys2men (i'll make love to you)... all-4-one (i swear) (my All time fav. song)... kci and jojo (all my life)  SWV (weak)... allure (all cried out) and so on....  the reason why im requesting this... is cause i want to spread LOVE..... listening to this stuff im sure many people will spread lots of love..... maybe reminise about lost love.. etc....
Love 90's era music, what a great compilation & Tribute, Thanks Pentatonix!! ✌
I even did not reach the end yet already hit the replay. 🤷‍♂️
A whole BOP 💜
You needed CRYSTAL WATERS %100 PURE LOVE !!!💕💕❤💚💙💙💛✨✨✨💃💃💃

We also need the 80s and begin 2000
not even a minute in and I got chills. well done all.
Not critical, and I totally understand what they were doing, but still odd to hear PTX being autotuned in "Believe"
Has Mitch been growing that moustache and sideburns specifically for this video...
MY GOD!!!! 😍😍😍❤️
sonique is top of my list...!!
0:29 Like Mitch.. 🤩😍
2:58 I didn't think this stupid thing would show up here. The worst that someone has ever created in the context of music. Everything else is great, of course, I congratulate you on the beautiful voices
Love Pentatonix but I find the visuals very distracting from the music.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great harmony as usual. Nothing new. :) But „It Feels So Good” was perfect harmony! Any chance to hear the whole song? :D
god i miss this times even if i was born in 2000
Cara, o canal apareceu totalmente aleatoriamente. Mas são bons demais. ahahah
Wow, this is the coolest thing i have ever seen🤩🤩🤩
Why isn't this on spotify??? I need this in my favorite's playlist desperately
Melhor medley que já ouvi 🤩🤩
50% human voice 50% audio engineering = great sound!
Well done
I think I speak for all of us when I say we need full versions of 'Waiting for Tonight' and 'Everytime We Touch'....  Damn..
😍
Every time we touch ❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕

My absolutly favorite in this Medley is Cher - Believe! They are taking the song on another Level and I hope that it will be released completely in a standalone version. :)
My favourite 😻 group
Man the 90s dance music was the BEST
WHO ? Who wrote the tune the songbird sings? Who made the diamonds we wear on rings? Who caused the snow and rain to fall? Who made spring, winter, summer and fall?  Who gave man a woman to love? Who made the clouds and sky above? Who lights the stars and moon in the night? Who makes heaven and beyond so bright?  Who gives us babies we follow till death? Who made us able to speak with our breath? Who gives us heroes willing to die? Who made the tears we shed as we cry.  Who shows us hope and guides our way The same one who loves us night and day.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet  Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart
Excuse me, I’m hoping in my time machine and visiting the 90’s. Talk amongst yourselves.
Yes, we need full versions of Everytime we touch and Believe!!!!

Really need a full version of everytime we touch. Would listen constantly
What is the title of the song in 1:40 seconds
You have GOT to do the full version of "feels so good" by Sonique!!!!!
PTX IS BAAAACKKK!!!
Oh yes ! Saw a preview on Instagram last night and this morning the recommended video popped up .
I'll admit this was great but it was pretty creepy when you started singing Cher's Believe a few seconds after i started wondering if you included the song in this Medley. Its like you guys knew haha.
Verdaderamente genial !!!!!
GOOD VIBES!
Petition for a full version of "Everytime we touch" and "Believe"😗
OMG The guy with the moustache in "It feels so good" <3
OMG!!!!! I LOVE this!!!! Please do LOTS more like this!!!
This is the definition of a nostalgia bomb
Just when I thought that I couldn't be blown away anymore.. They keep dropping new music that still has me going "how the hell?"
When they started singing Believe by Cher, my heart melted and I started crying. I need this
ICONIC ASF
AHHHHHH THE SERATONIN
Cher's Believe always reminds me of that Buffy episode where she had an actual demon as her college dorm roommate...
Petition for a full version of Eiffel65 BLUE
Dammmmmmmn
Just WOW 😇
And why do you call it a 90's medly, when  a lot of the song are NOT actually FROM the 90's??🙄🙄
Well....Cascada- Everytime We Touch, is NOT a 90's song...It's from 2006....Just saying....
Scott looks like John Walker. That is all
AMOO
Hiiiii, I know y’all have already visited KCMO, but I was like 8 then, so I was wondering if y’all could do another tour in KCMO when y’all can?
P.E.R.F.E.C.T. BRAZIL HAAAAAAAAAA MY GOD!
When is it going to be available on Spotify?
80s pls
Круто!!! 🙌
Ceiline dion
at 3:11 I Loved that
Do they use autotune? Because they sound way to good, correct me if I'm wrong
An original dance album is on my PTX wish list. Any one else ready to dance?
Wow the best
Kevin and Kristin... my bisexual heart just wants to look at them all day, everyday. u-u <3
No se... a mi siempre me gustaron por lo que podían hacer 5 personas SOLAS. Efectos, masterización... Hay algo de canción en este autotune... me encantaría que algún día recuperen su esencia
This is literally SO GOOD 😭
Where is montero pentatonix version <3
I love ❤️👸🏼🤴🏻🤴🏼🤴🏾🤴🏿
donwanna this to end 💔
Love them and this video but I thought they were supposed to be an acapella group. What's with the auto tune?
Mbappe expect from good footballer is also a very good beatboxer...
Muitoooooooooooo Top 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍🔝
Increíbles
💕
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
OMG!!!!!!  ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
After such a long time you guys finally got to do "Believe" by Cher. It just shows how far you guys have come 🥰🥰🥰 Amazing job on the medley :D

Thank you, PTX , for this journey to my youth ❤️

Sehr gelungenes Musikvideo. Super Übergänge, sehr kreativ gelöst.
Haven't seen these guy in a while but what happened to the old bassist and the girl?
sempre me deixam de boca aberta
There is so much serotonin flowing in my brain now 🥲
Kaya ada cinta satu mlm barusan 😁
Dear Pentatonix:  I challenge you to produce an album (or two or three) dedicated to the FULL-LENGTH versions of ALL of the songs that you've ever used in the medleys you've released over the years.  We.  Would.  LOVE.  It.
Oh mon Dieu!!!
This was brilliant! Right up until cher...
Mitch's voice + this 2 bitboxer's= perfection
Now it's human music.
THIS IS SO COOL OMFGGGG
OMG THAT: You get to show me loOooOve
PERFECT! BEAUTIFUL!  SUPER PENTATONIX!
Cinta satu malam (?)
Thank you
Sounds great, good selection of songs, but you can't have a 90s dance tribute without the one and only Scatman
The songs are great.  The sunglasses are soooo hot, where are they from? I like to buy them. 😄
Corona - The Rythm of the Night?
YABAI!!!!!!!
This is good but i miss Avi
Awh mai garsh... They make me feel sooo Young Again... Miss u Guys so much.. and ofkorz to all this SONGSZ
I didn't know Jaylen Brown could beatbox
Love it 😍😍😍
0:10 no nsoaevo fosse degli anni 90 -_-
I love this! Wish you included return of the Mack 😍
Absolutely love the selection except there was only one I didn’t recognize. But also I wanna say you all were on point except the tempo on some. I miss the 80’s, 90’s,70’s so hope you all will do more from the 90’s, but hope you all will do the 80’s & 70’s but maybe the early 2000’s too. The 70’s only because I was born in 75, however I grew up on all these including my mom’s music too.
I love her hair
Not to be rude....but one of the guys look🏳️‍🌈
WOW
This is amazing.. i cant 🤣🤣❤️
Nearly all of these are improvements on the originals.  True musicianship.  LOVE!
I wish we could get Pentatonix  to make playlist recommendations. This medley made me dance so much !!
Really love it❤️❤️❤️😊😊
😍😍🔥🔥
I want to know who are these who disliked the video! Names please 😑
Прелесть, таланты 👍👍👍😘😘😘😘❤❤❤❤❤💐💐💐💐💐😍😍😍
Amazing 😍😍😍😍😍😍
1:23 I NEED A FULL VERSION!!!!! 😱
This video reminded me that ATC (which apparently stands for "A Touch of Class") existed... I haven't heard that song in an extremely hot minute and forgot all about their existence. Thanks for the nostalgia, PTX.
Amazing!! More pop music like this,please
I love Kristen hair
Semplicemente meravigliosi!!!
Вы крутые ребята
Each one of these songs needs a full version done by pentatonix! Each of these are better than the originals! Love their own special twist they add to each song. And as always they kill it with their beautiful voices and perfect timing with the beatboxing and the bass.
When I hear all of this songs I have all my childhood come together (spent to much in youtube since I was 6)
My mom is a big fan of pentatonix, and when she listened to this you should’ve heard how loud she screamed of joy! It also made her tear up because it brought a lot of nice memories. Thanks Pentatonix!
Holy crap .. they out Cher'd, Cher.
This needs way more views of than it’s getting!!! Share!
I thought Axel F - Crazy Frog will be there, AHHAHA
2:13 ok but for some reason this 'tum tum tum' is underrated and has suddenly grown on me its like Kirstie, Scott, and Mitch are at my door ringing the doorbell except they ARE the doorbell   2:25 also this 'tumm-oooo' im sorry these chords are just too beautiful and angelic
What happened to the low voice guy with long hair? 😐
petition for a full version of Believe 💕 🔥 (and Around The World... actually all of them)
Great!!!
Ja foi bom . Se venderam. Agora é mais um grupo.
I read that as “Dance Monkey” and got so mad for no reason
Full 90s Dance Album pls ;)
Dem lips, you know
Excellent... wow...!!!
....*presses replay about 50 times and continues to rock out to the music* most of my fav 90s music as i grew up!!
Bro come one it's over? That was so amazing!
They are all so into it and look like they are really having fun with this collection of music. That makes it more fun for us watching it too. It should be incredible live when they can finally do shows again!
I love hearing matt sing. And more of kevin singing.
they still existe! damn
PENTATONIX ITS CRIMINAL HOW YALL DONT HAVE A EVOLUTION OF MARIAH CAREY SONG

Loved this medley! Only complaint....no autotune! Y'all are wayyyyy too good for that ish!
Amazing to think all of those great tunes were out only just over ten years ago....  ...oh, wait... :'(
Sometimes I think that I love Pentatonix too much...    but then I think NO THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LOVING PENTATONIX TOO MUCH THEY ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOREVER
Adorei
Man they just keep blowing me away lmao
Oh my! please give us more of these Medleys PTX it is so enjoyable to listen to. 💗

I love Every. Single. Member. (welcome to the fam, Matt!)  But this compilation FULLY DEPENDS ON KEVIN BEING A DEDICATED AND TALENTED AND DETERMINED BEAST OF A BEATBOXER.  And a new daddy, of course. Congrats to Kevin and Leigh <3     But seriously.  Kevin: you are an instrument all on your own. !!!

So, while I remember all these songs from various places or the radio back in the day, did anyone else get a different nostalgia trip from this medley? Did anyone else get throwbacks to the "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC VOLUME #" commercials? heh.
Guy in red jacket should sing more
They are so damn good that autotune ruins this... Love you guys.
This is mindblowing.Amazing! Incredible, no words to describe! We need a full version of every single song!!

My god Kirstin looks gorgeous .. Reminds me of a crush I has on a girl way back in the late 90s early 2000..  I wonder what hairstyle is that or if there a name for that style ..
Thank you Pentatronix, for all songs and this *remix*, i follow you all this years,, i like musicals and now (if i could) would i visit you all live! Dont give up, stay as team together, be it in good or bad times! Maybe my english is bad.. but i think u understand me..
I just want to take a moment to say... KEVIN IS A FATHER OMG!!! *ahem* okay, back to the video.
New favorite video..... and Kirsten is rocking her inner Kylie Minogue!
This is what you all do best love every part of this 90's mix

Люблю вас, ребята!!!!❤❤❤❤❤💋
Ok obsessed with this one 😍😍😍
I hate that Everytime We Touch is in this. It wasn't 90s unless I'm missing something. The rest is perfect 👌  Edit: okay so it's sampled from a 90s track but the 90s one wasn't dance so point still stands. 😂
Full version of I'm Blue!

I always repeat 1:38 I mean it's awesome and pure perfection❤️
I here by pledge 30-40$ in my wallet waiting for this album. =D
Thk u for bringing me back all my high school memories 😘
This is awesome, but Cascada’s “Everytime We Touch” was released in 2005, not in the 90’s 😬
Why is there no Cotton Eye'd Joe? Isn't that considered a 90's staple?
I want all full versions of these from the. So I can make an album
Kirstie’s voice in rhythm is a dancer is PERFECT
😍😍😍😍
How does this video have 1.2K dislikes??? 😑😑😑😑
I should have a drink in my hand.
FINALY , MEDLEY , I AM WAITING FOR IT A TWO YEARS
Stick to xmas songs but cool tribute to the 80s
This is now my favorite video on YouTube
Did they replace someone in the group? What happened to the white dude who had long hair?
Can u please do a whole 80s and 90s album???!!!!!!
This is amazing! I just can't get over the Botox singing face 🤣 I mean that's crazy... Faces should move when singing 😆
Can’t find this song in Apple Music!! Help!!!
Oh goshh... dance remix it's you guyss. Love it
MARAVILHOSOSSS

So amazing. I remember everything. I'm still sure of the text.
Teniendo talento no necesitas nada mas 👌🏾😍
PUT THAT IN SPOTIFY OMGGG❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi Pentatonix and team. I'm from Indonesia and I'm a big fans of you guys since Senior High School (2013). I'm really waiting for Pentatonix to cover Indonesian songs that are famous abroad such as Lathi from Weird Genious, To The Bone from Pamungkas, etc. Good luck guys! 🥰
what happend to the previous member?
So Nice
A week late...still awesome!
I haven't heard some of these in damn near two decades. Goosebumps. Simply goosebumps.
I need a cover of Better of alone pls.
My wife: damn, she’s sexy in curly hair. Me: yeah, but check out his glasses tho...
I hope The will make a hole CD😍👍🙏 90❤❤❤❤
Amazing...
They make all the songs delicious ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fantastico !!!!!!
Wow. I grew up with this music and I have to say......... it's covered just fantastic !!!!! ;-)
What's with the fat nose no chin filter?
Przyjemnie się tego słucha 😍🥰❤
You guys blow me away - straight into the 90s. What a medley - in my top 3 list,  thanks a lot!!
Do you ever use sheet music for your arrnagements? Or did you ever do it? :)
SOCOOOOORROOOO ISSSSO ESTÁ INCRIVEL!!!!!!!!!!  AMAZINNGGGGGGGGGGGG
Pentatonix basically took a syringe and injected nostalgia straight into me
awesome, they could make a cd with those songs and everyone would listen... btw. anyone knows the name of those songs?
Super . Jesteście najlepsi
Buenísimo ♥️♥️😍
PTXofficial if you are reading this comment, I just want to say that you’re music video is mind blowing. You guys are so talented and I am so proud of what you guys have accomplished during this pandemic. Love you guys
Always the best at medley
❤
Got this on LOOP!
Fun medley. They got most of the prominent commercial dance tunes from the 90s. Only one I really wanted to hear that they didn't do was "Another Night" by The Real McCoy.
I want to hear full versions of Rhythm is a dancer and Gypsy Woman ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Am I the only one that wants them to cover I2I from A Goofy Movie?
4:51 .....BOMBAAAA🥰😍🤩
Phenominal
I NEED A FULL VERSİON OF SHOW ME LOVE AND GYPSY WOMAN ASAP XXXXXX
KILLED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love it
These people look like straight out of Cyberpunk
We need an 80s dance songs by them.
Now I need a karaoke party 90s style  #partyalone
I wish I could like this more than just once❤️
Me encantó 👏👏👏🎶🎶🎶
So many flashbacks!!!
original comment: can't stop replaying this banger edited comment: ok nearly every day multiple times since this was uploaded i have replayed so gooooooooooooood :)
love it... couldn't stop staring at Kirsten's lips though, the gloss...
Thank you Pentatonix   ,, We had great music back then . I missed the 90's and  2000 -2010 ..
Wow!! So good! I love this I want a whole version : Gonna make you sweat, please 😄😄
Yes, I watched it again.
So good! Would have loved to have the scatman in there though!
The '90s was my "coming of age" decade. Entered high school in 1990, started a family in 2001. So that was my "party decade." Yet I only recognize about 2/3 of these.  I must say, though, that Mitch makes a perfect autotuned Cher!
aaaaaah....so much memories!!!! <3
Mitch's high notes gives me chills everytime. Love ❤❤
Christin Looks Like Marilyn Monroe In This Video
Thx u pentatonix. U guys song really help passed these hard time. Also full song im blue pls  T.T
Perfect! Everybody dancing! 🇧🇷❤️
2:14 everytime we touch serasa dengar lagu judulnya cinta satu malam
Please tell me you're making this into a whole album 😩🙏
I'm sure they all love what they do, but Matt really shows it in his performance. He can hardly keep the smile off his face!
Where did the guy with the long hair and deep voice go?
34+35 please
You guys just made relive my childhood. Thank you. You’ve just put a big fat smile on my face
1:30 mitches everywhere bouncing through my head is what I needed today
I didn't know Mbappè sang
I'm getting Jujubee vibes....
Wait... where are  2unlimited, Culture Beat, Masterboy, Ace of Base, Ice Mc, Dr Alban, The real Mc Coy,  songs like the rythm of the night, right in the night, Love is all around,   ...  obviously we haven't listen to the same Dance in the 90's
OMG!!!! Loved it!
DO YOU BELIEEEEEEEEEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE
AMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
waiting for this kind, thank youuuu
Damn I forgot how drop dead gorgeous she was  And how impressed I always feel about how high that dude Sings
I like this song so much accidentally listen to this at my twitch live stream got 17 Copyright strikes on one video XD
Wow 😊😊😊😊
We missed you so much!
full version of "Finally" please 🤗
0:54 chills....
holy crap i'd listen to your "I'm blue" full cover
I miss the 90s
Awesome! you bring me back the memories :D
mitch's "everybody dance now"! so....💥💥💣  2:41 cinta satu malam...oh indah nya...cinta satu malam buatku melayang... 😂😂
4:44 pleaseee this is one of my fav songs yall should make a full cover!
NEED THIS IN SPOTIFY 😭💗😭💗
OKAY MATT with the solo!!🙌🏾👏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾
1:13 I WAS LIKE 🤩
Anybody else cry hysterically during this? It brought back so many childhood memories omg❤️😭
nice video
Tks! Love U!!!!
How can 1.1K people thumbs down this???
Matt's solo caught me off guard WOW
Would any of these songs be put on Spotify??
Alice deejay!!
😍 Группа огонь, голоса вообще супер слов нету 😍
I didn’t know half of these 🤦‍♀️ I was a teenager in the 90’s what was I listening too?!?! Oh yeah. Country and oldies 😂🙄
2:56 I did not expect excellent !!!!
Amei o momento summer eletrohits
Honest question is there any basic effects like echo? Ok there is obvious echo and basic autotune like effects to fit the genre. Incredible nonetheless
Wow, this is the coolest thing I've seen all week!
Thus was great pls make hip hop and rb 90s, be honest that what you think of when you hear 90s.
Kok ada cinta satu malam sih
See I like this.  They've busted ass for so long on acapella alone.  There's nothing wrong with having fun with a little auto-tune...
This is truly what we all needed at this time. A light at the end of this past year.
The people who gave this a thumbs down clearly have no taste for 90s music. lol  Seriously though, this was amazing. I've listened to it a number of times already, and I only discovered it last night!
Petition for this masterpiece to be on Spotify 🙌🏻
that moment when half of these songs have been making their way to my YouTube playlists, and now this mashup was recommended
A R T
Mitch looks more and more like Freddie Mercury every time they post 😂😅
Yes to all of this
Finally. Stuff I've seen live
Cascada in full version please!!!
Didn't expect the auto-tune, but it worked!!
THREE MILLION VIEWS!!!
It was great but, you  couldn't give the black guys just one solo!
They look more like the 80s than the 90s
Why is their rendition is so broadway and not popsee?
Sing - Rough and Fike Australia
Petition pentatonix for savage garden
Absolutely everything about this video is amazing 😍😍
2:55 I got hyped & started head bobbing when "Blue by Eiffel 65" kicked in after "Everytime We Touch". What a classic dance song! LOVE THAT!
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
Kirstin not only looks absolutely beautiful, but does an amazing job! It was so nice to hear her sing more.
We miss avi man
Come sempre una conferma siete. Vi amo!!!!
Aren't we gonna talk about how beautiful Kirstin looks? 😍😍
who else would like to hear pentatonix sing BTS 'dynamite? congratulations I love your work. 😊
Creative as always
More please

This is awesome. I love 90's
I saw these guys in Orlando just behind the pit! The place was sold-out and tix were $$$. Worth every penny!!!

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

You guys owe us the full version , this is a delight.
Kristin was such a beauty, but with the operations, she destroys herself 😥
I love BELIEVE ❤️😍
On witch CD can l find it
As of April 21st less than 7 people out of every 1000 who rated this song gave a thumbs down. Proof no matter who good you won't please everybody.
💗
Matthew 4:17 - From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Tomorrow is promised to no one - please let Him into your hear today.

Great mix! Love most of those songs
This video have not enough likes.

SZACUN MORDECZKI .

Cool, but danger – epilepsy.
PLS PLS DROP THIS SONG ON ALL MUSIC PLATFORMS????
Руки Вверх \0/
PETITION FOR GIVIN US A CHROMATICA MEDLY ASAP!!🥺💕😭
With this much talent in the group, I wish this wasn’t so overproduced. Auto-tune, although commonly used in dance hits, just isn’t needed here. The reverb addition was ok but a little less would’ve been better. I’m a fan of the pure vocal talent in this group and I’d like to hear more of that.
Nossa... Muito bom, fiquei toda arrepiada
THIS IS SO GOOD I CAN'T
Thanks guys.  As i 90's kids, i really enjoyed it💗
Jesteście super
Bardzo ale to bardzo fajne
That would be the perfect pitch.😸
As super impressive as this is, it's a little too disjointed to enjoy as a track I think. I think it jumps around between songs a little too much, which is unfortunate because I love a lot of the tracks on here, and the covers are amazing.
so beautiful
Petition for a full version of "believe"✋🏽
Beautiful
I love that Pentatonix understands that the 90s didn't end until the mid 2000's. They get it.
Are ptx will sing full version of this songs? I want listen all of them.
WE NEED THIS IN ALBUM FORM PLZ
please cover disney songs
Ok Joe exotic
you are wonderful guys !! Love it! Thanks!
This is so good you guys are amazing, also the editing is fire well done whoever did it.
Do you remember how we teenagers of the 90’s felt about the 60’s? That how teens now feel about the 90’s...😬😎
красапеты!!!
where's the guy with the deep voice?
0:52 mitch gives me chills every time <3 <3
The definition of perfection
Молодцы... Пох что версия натянута
el mejor de todos sin dudas!!!
Как всегда великолепны!😍 Потрясающе 👍🏻
Awesome
If there where on the voice no chair would turn around for them...... rubbish
I always thought these guys were ok... holy cow!!!! Theya re the best! They just resurrected my childhood!
@PTXOFFICIAL PLEASE DO SOME EVOLUTION AGAIN I WANT TO HEAR SHANIA TWAIN AND SHAKIRA. HUHU
I missed some better dance songs from the 90's which is Barbie Girl- Aqua

YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Who else wants to watch Night at the Roxbury after hearing this?
Que le pasó al rostro de la chica? Se ve muy distinta
Michs high notes will always and forever surprise me
Oh the memories!!! 😍
Отдельное спасибо за описание всей подборки, это было великолепно! Как и всегда. Love!!!
I need the 2000's version
I liked the video then double checked that I liked it. I don't want errors where things I like are involved.
I love this so much ❤️❤️
Awesome

90’s babies dream 🔥🔥

Amazing! Just fucking amazing!!!
genius :) what hits, thanks for bringing back my childhood
Having my own dance party in my room.
Dá vontade né Glee?
I'm surprised Scatman isn't in there. One of the best 90's Dance songs, and very difficult to sing.
Listening to Pentatonix is like being clobbered left and right with awesomeness. You feel that punch in the gut but it's all love and happiness, and you want it again and again and again.... sighs...
🇯🇵
I normally love the medleys, but this was too choppy and too fast with jarring changes.
vi amo :)
Are they out of sync? And what's wrong with her mouth? Sound great, but the visuals felt weird.
I wish one day Pentatonix can tour Australia... pleeaaasseeee
You guys are so crazy! And talented!
For a European, it's really strange not to have "Gala - Freed From Desire" in a dance music medley from the 90s.
Mitch was born to sing this medley!
A bunch of those were 2000s though :|
Those outfits are amazing. My favourite was the white suit with the blue shirt.
Totally love you guys smile while singing. Looks soo entertaining with your song.
OMFG this Cascada made me cry. This is pure perfection.
i need to know the names of these songs
Mitch's voice is so clean on these electronic songs!
This is everything.!
もはや機械
Even though I miss Avi, this gave me goosebumps 🥰
3:54
Mitch's mustache and Kristin's hair is EVERYTHING!
I’ve completely overlooked CHER’S BELIEVE.  PENTATONIX - thank you thank you thank you for introducing this song into my life. (04:02)
This is the soundtrack from my childhood. 100% Nostalgia 😍 And it’s also most of the soundtrack for Night at the Roxbury 😂😂😂
How is I'm just discovering these guys now?? I thought their cover of Bohemian Rhapsody was absolutely fantastic, and this Medley video had me smiling the whole time. Brilliant work guys, keep it up. 👍
Sztoos !!
This awakened the young me again hearing all these 90s jams   Pentatonix thank you for this it put a huge smile on my face
I think I was already older in the 90s than these folks are now
I desperately need to see Mitch do "Jackie" with that stunning voice of his!!! Oh please oh please!
full version of "Believe" pls!!!! 😭😭😭
Me encanta!!!!!!!!!
0:20 I NEEEEED A COVERRRRRR OF THISSSSSSS
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS ON TOUR 😭
Woooohooooooooo, great compilation, very catchy
This is my favorite by far... Brought me back to when I was in middle school and I couldn't help but sing along. Makes me wanna dance! These guys are incredible. ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
All the amazing fun memories. 🙌
2:56 i need a full version of that asap...... those adlibs are SICK
Please do full versions of all of these!
So freaking good!
Nostalgi! Greetings from Russia
Part 2 plssss <3
Not only a walk down memory lane,  but purely perfection! Probably gonna listen 10 more times,  AMAZING!!!
I really needed this.
Amazing as always😘
Plus making this mashup a full album
Going to go out on a limb and say that PTX should do a collabo with the jabbowakies
I love you guys!!!!!  What I have witnessed by watching all of the reactions on Youtube is that without a doubt that this group is bringing different races of people who love music together into one big family.  Thank you Pentatonix, I love you guys/girl.
I feel seen.  This is like my early 2000s work and biking playlist.
The Sonique cover was sooooo good!
The group reminds me of the Nylons. Outstanding vocals.
What are the pierce earrings Mitch Grassi is wearing? Somebody tell me!
We need part 2... excelent!!
'I'm Blue...' :D
I just want to see Pentatonix live :(
WOW!!! Absolutely great!!!
Ouuuuuuuuuwwwwwwww increibles voces!!!! Congratulations!!!

These were high school power songs for me. I loved this video so much
I’m so glad to hear from them omg i love them
Whoever read this, REMEMBER: Life is short. Cut out negativity, forget gossip, say goodbye to people who don´t care. Spend time with people who are always there.
boom boom boom boom!!
One of the most talented groups that i ever heard.
We need full version of every songs.
Any day that I hear vengaboys is a good day
Gracias por este viaje a adolescencia  terminó mi dia con una sonrisa saludos desde Argentina
I have a love hate relationship with medleys. I love them because I can always appreciate the arrangement, but I hate them because each snippet is just a giant tease.
It’s hard not to dance to this!
Whoo! That was amazing! Had me out of my seat dancing!!
okay guys but please, i'm going to need a full version of better off alone :,)
Cant' stop hearing this medley! Fantastic!
What has happened to the girls lips?????
This is great, I want a part 2 with Real McCoy, Captain Hollywood (Project), Ice MC, Dj Bobo, Alexia, Amber, Stars on 54...
Oh my god the sonique part at 1:52😍, here with me , for à  FULL VERSION FOR IT FEELS  SO GOOD 🤗
What is wrong with the little black-haired guy? He is either addicted, ill or whatever..
Half of the views are probably me rewatching this masterpiece! 😞❤️
The Cher - Believe cover 🙌🏾🎉🔥
Classic! 😆
CANTA DOS PIRATAS DOS CARIBES
Okay, now that you have done the 90's,  PLEASE can we se a medley of 80's Disco,  and a 70's Rock n Roll.   That would be so AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pure 🔥
Época boa esses dances dos anos 90! Só lembra os passinhos nas boates!
I love you 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
5 kanjers 💛💛💛💛💛💐💫✨🤲👍🏻💚🤝💗
Best years !!!! 😍😍😍
Dear Pentatonix, This is an open letter from all of your fans (i think I'm not lying when I'm saying that)! Please make this is as a full album because it's just that so good! <3
2:50 holy sh... what the wow amazing
Oh my LORD Kirstin!!
I'm missing l'amour toujours (I'll fly with you) from Gigi D'Agostino.
Awesome🙏✨🎼
Hi Kirstin, please don't do anything to your mouth anymore.
I Need it in spotify!!!! I can't spot earing it!
Hard 😉🇧🇷90's
Love it! Nostalgia!
Please do all of those songs in full length and make an album out of it!!!
All the memories come flooding back. Great mix 👌 what happened to superfruit?
My 90s Eurodance heart beats faster🤩💃
So fun! Loved it!!!!!
Kirstin is beautiful! 😍
Exitos desde Perú se ganaron un admirador de su talento 😊😊😊🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
Those harmonies jeeez! Best Nostalgia mashup ever . Just wow
4:02 matt’s voice thooo
4:01 10 years later they finally get "Believe" worked out.
I know they specialize on Pop songs but Gah!!! If they did a Linkin Park medley.... It would be the absolute BOMB!! 💣🤯
Wow, that's awesome - even though half of those song haunted my days as a supervisor for kids during my time in civil service. :) "Play it agaaaaaaiiinnnnnnn!" *squeeeeeaaaaal*"... ;)
its good but,,,,, corect me if I am wrong...........We have from izrael The Voca People ...This is different but they use PC to change voice and  add some sound. The Voca People they did not just pure voice....again correct me if I am wrong.
She actually sounds like cascada, it's beautiful
WOW! 😍
Is it possible to put this on Spotify ?
Mitch is look like Freddie Mercury here lol
Oleeee, se dice en mi país, 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸, como siempre 💕
top fan Brasileiro....
Would love some captions
A lot of good songs in the 90's! Man i wish i was there
I Love It!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow nice song and beautiful voice 👏👏👏👏👍❤️🌷 New friend
Ok now if people were like "only 90's kids will remember" about this instead of a bunch of united states specific things or things that happened/continued in the 00's? I, a gen-z, would understand the sentiment.
More Medleys please
And Britney Spears? 🥲
Omg my favorite songs !!
No Soul to Soul or Marky Mark lol.
when you won't think it's a mashup at 01:20 (Gonna Make You Sweat - Rhythm is a Dancer) and 03:10 (Deep Inside - Show Me Love) and 04:45 onward
Absolutely amazing!
damn Avi looks different i guess
2:55 this.
Where is 10hrs version? :O Please
When I've heard all of the songs before but don't know most of the titles. Thanks there's the titles in the description
But they are dressed like the 80's
the thing is that dude did not si his highest note he can go higher which is crazy
PLEASE do an "Evolution of Taylor Swift" PLEASE
I hope they do one of this for every decade
The waiting for tonight part 😍😍😍
PTX!! I really want Eiffle 65 'Blue' full cover... please ㅠㅠ
I’m a 90s kid but always thought most of these songs were 80s hits 🤔
WHY ARE ALL OF THOSE SONGS MEMES???
Omg! You're from another world! ❤️
The best! Super voices!!!
I love it, as every thing they do, but I have to admit that I miss the times when they where just the five of them singing in front of a camera.
Demasiado bueno!🥳
Amazing as usual.  I loved the video.
Better off alone 11/10  :)
So goood
Thanks for this Medley :)
Would love a full cover of Sonique's, "It Feels So Good".
I miss Avi Kaplan he's the cutest and he's my favorite he's voice is so deep and calming
They dont have noises.Purfect.
Exijo un cover solo de "BELIEVE" de cher 😂😍♥️ los amo!!!!
Pentatonix supremacy 🛐🛐🛐
good
Well that was amazing.
Oh lala! It feels so good.
Hi
Wow...it's hard to believe that it's just purely vocals
Where is 2unlimited? Kings of dance music.
Always been so talented wwhheewww
well, how can u sing Cher ? vocoder and autotune impersonation ?
I prefer Mitch withoutmoustache
2:15 everyone
Kirstie always looks flawless
In hard times we tend to look back to sooth our pain. Thank You.
You guys are so great! There are no words! I love songs from the 90s. You gave me a smile for the rest of the day. Greetings from Russia!!
Can you do Vengaboys remix? 🥰
😶🙏
2:15
petition for a full version of "Believe" QWQ <3
Insta like! Hahaha  What makes anyone to dislike videos like this?! Unbelievable...
2:15 every time we touch  for Indonesian listeners cinta satu malam
THAT IS THE PENTATONIX I REMEBERED AND MISSED SO MUCH, THE ONES FROM "DAFT PUNK"!! Welcome back guys
Cher Believe version is best
🇫🇷 👍🏼🥰
Thank God these people found each other
Félicitations de la France 🇨🇵👏❤
2:14
How does Mitch hit those notes?
Am I the only one thinking that Kristin reminds a little bit to Baby from Dirty Dancing just because of the curly and blond hair? It is really really good.
Kirstin - OMG!!!
It was not enough of I'm blue daboodee-dabooday...
What happened to their other member?
KPOP PLEASE!!!! KPOP SONGS!!!!
Go part 2 please
О наконец то,ждал с эволюции музыки,лет 7 похожего видоса)
When Matt starts singing Cher tho! Get. It. Matt.
please do the macarena
Spent the whole time thinking I'd love a full version of this song.  Then Eiffel 65 came up and I thought blue is awesome but I'd love a full version of move your body.  Finally I fell into the 90s completely when believe played,  the nostalgia is playing all over my heart.  Need to hear this all day now.
Hi I'm a big fan I've been watching your videos ever since I was a little girl I loved your Christian music that would help me go to sleep when I was little and I just want to remind you you guys are so cool
F***ing awesome And I can hear all of the words in the song
autotune?
What was that? 😳👍 I am sure that I won' t heard nothing better today😍
Just awesome!
Y'all are AMAZING!!!!!!
This is always AmaSING they always bring the 🔥
Kirstin looks gorgeous ❤❤ I love their music so much!!
Getting all my memories back
Feeling so good after listen to this We need pt 2
One word..... P E R F E C T I O N ✨
the biggest revelation in this video is that everytime we touch by cascada is a cover??????
They all used to be beautiful now the girl  looks like a plastic surgery nightmare. So gross. The dark haired guy has a terrible facial hair thing happening, and the other 3 have all got fat 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ wtf happened?
IM SHAKING MY ASSSS
I am having massive high school and early uni flashbacks.  Not sure if happy or if the trauma is kicking in.  LOL
This brought me back I was listening to a lot of dance music between the ages of 18 and 21 old dance/electronic music and now that taste has evolved into EDM.  😅 Now I can't hear certain dance tracks without having my memories being jerked back to my late teens (back when PlayStation let you install your own music)
Love from Sweden 👍❤❤
dude, the part of blueeeeee AAA HELP MEEE😭😭♥️
I wanna hear a 70s version next. This is amazing
I should have known!  I knew this was going to be amazing, and then, I discover that "amazing" is a gross understatement.  Cher, Jennifer Lopez, even CeCe Peniston, and so many other great 90s dance hits.    I think it is safe to say I shall watch this video a lot, from now on.
Amei
OMG I remember watching you guys win the sing off when I was in MIDDLE SCHOOL! Look at you guys go <3 So happy for you
Turning my room into a club tomorrow. This song plays every hour. Seriously, these are all the jams 🥳
Omg, you're look just like Anitta! :O  (Greeeeeeeeeeeeeat video!)
Love this mash up. Also, I thought Cascada's Everytime We Touch came out in 2005/6.
Perfect.... Again...
I need more parts to this please. making this a playlist as we speak
Kirsty's hair has me drooling
I love it, reminds me of old days, big love from Indonesia.
Zaaaaarpaaaadoooooss
Every time I’m like wow this video is there best... nope then a new one comes outs & that’s the best. LOL Sooo good guys!!!
4:02 they finally got around to it
Excuse friends. Why is this not available as a download on Apple Music?!
Well, some of them are from 2000-2001 but it brought me 90s nostalgia back, so I'm happy.
It's criminal that space jam isn't here.
JLo 😎 Iconic Song
Jennifer Lopez❤️❤️❤️❤️ waiting for tonight
Mannn this was so good! I have 95% of those songs in my iPod right now lmao
Loove!!! Beatifuulll!!!!
Waiting for tonight 🌿
Soniiique
All my favorites!
I miss when they had a bass... 🌚
Petition for a full version of "Belive" ✋🏾
glad we had the opportunity to hear kirstin and matt on their own some more, i love mitch and scott but sometimes it’s nice to hear the others sing individually
Full version of Believe please and thank you.
OMG!   Hermosos voces!
We need full versions of Everytime we touch by Cascada  Blue by Eiffle 65 And Belive by Cher

LOVE IT!
Uau! Amei!
Such a incredible awesome acoustic band!!!We love to hear your magic music!!Thank you for sharing this music video with us!!👌😊🙏❗👍⭐👏
Wow!!! I was born in '83  Heard all these songs. Reminded me oh the 90s. Nephew was like, you like this? I was like of course!!! How you think I used to be a raver? And how I can deejay as an old man than your skinny pants style 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't cascada's every time we touch come out in 2006, and wasn't it a Maggie Reilly song in the 90's?
Was that autotune on Cher's "Believe"?
A long version for David guetta's song and around the world please ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mbappe is rlly good !
Mitch is GLOWING! I’ve missed him and I hope he’s alright!
Love
Beautiful music, beautiful people 🌹
We need full versions on a 90s album 🥰😍
KEVIN! WHAT?! Talent, talent, talent.  Pure musicians...all of them.  Consumate!!!

Wow! Amazing!
Show!
Since watching the premiere I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve watched this, and spending every second hoping for a 90s album... deluxe with about 30 tracks! 😍😍😍😍😍
OMG so cool 😎
So happy to see you pop up with new music! What a treat! You all amaze me how you make it all look so easy and flawless. You come and and out of a songs quick and never look like you struggle with air one bit. Keep them coming and i hope this is the 1st of many to come again. Love you all so much! Been so long, Mitch has aged just a little 😉! ❤❤❤
Fantastic! I love them!
Wowwww!!! Amazing!

Alternative title: Mostly songs you know all the words to, but don't know the name of, nor who sings it
♥️♥️♥️
OH MY GOD I MISSED HIGH NOTE MITCH
Без бородатого вы не пентатоника!)
Guys, you should do the JLo evolution, Kirstin is a huge fan of hers and I know you will love it!

Muy bueno!! Me encantaria una full version de casi todas las canciones en algun momento! Saludos XD
❤👌
I could listen to this on repeat for an hour
This is like listening to a late night 90s commercial for a CD! I love it so much!!!
*1997 ☺
Boygroup remix ??
My late teen years and early 20s   memories...👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽  You guys forgot "Macarena",  "another night" real mccoy, "this is the night" amber and "mr vain"... that would have made me wish to go back in time ..😁
Living on a prayer from Bon Jovi please

I miss the Old pentatonix with avi. He was such a Better bass and also. I miss when they didn’t used that much autotune☺️
Absolutely loved PENTATONIX's version of "Show Me Love" and "Finally". For me personally, it was 100X better than the originals, especially with Scot's soulful voice.♥️♥️♥️
THEY NEED TO DO DYNAMITE!!!!!! by bts

This was well needed
PEOPLE! You have no idea what Freaking Bangers these songs are if you weren't born that time ... no offense was such a strong vibe
why 1K people dont like this? whyyyyyyy?
someone has the exact song titles of this medley?
hey , where's the scatman ?
I like it and i enjoyed it:)
Oh my God, I never thought that 2:15 there's also song (from Indonesian singer) that has the same rhythm, I'm dead 😭📉 idk if it's exact the same... :')
Soo many memories ! Great stuff, when do we get the next one ? !
Awesome (as always) 🔥

I have a question. Is there a chance for you guys to do a cover of The Song of the Sea? It used to be my grandmothers favorite song, and this may is the 10th year since she died.
👏👏👏👏
No Aqua🥲🥲🥲
Grandiosi come sempre! 🤩
Yes yes yes
Am I crazy or does Matt look like Mbappe?
I love Kristin's new hair style!
More, cher songs.  and Cascade!!!
you shud be put STEPS songs, but this medley is fire !!!!!
The guy in the middle is the most 90's looking guy ever.
I feel like if J-Lo ever gets honored at the Kennedy Center, Kirstin would be perfect as one of her tribute performers.
Luvs maybe correct the artist for "Everytime we touch" in the description to "Maggie Riley". What you named was the cover artist 👀 thanks for featuring the last two, hUgE bops!!!!
Please make an Album with all that songs! :D
Boy do I want a full version of 'Beleive' from you guys after hearing that.
❤
Could u record full versions of all these songs ,please?😍😍😍
They should just do the Night at the Roxbury soundtrack!
Faltou o Kasinão
Pure genius! They're amazing !
I really need the full version of "It Feels so Good"
This just makes me want an Aqua medley.
What is the name of the song after "Everytime we touch"?
Guys, I can't stop watching this video, listening to this medley. I hate to beg but please, PLEASE, do an 80s Dance Medley and also a 2000s Dance Medley, this is too good. Beautiful, brilliant, breathtaking, astonishing, perfect. This is the Beyoncé of medleys. We have been blessed.

As a 90s kid, oh my God.
Lance Vance, is that you ?

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Realmente son unos genios de la música los admiro.
NO! NO DANCE MONKEY, ITS CURSED IT BROUGHT CORONA PLEASE NO NO
Petition to make this an album!!!
Im only a teen and I already feel nostalgic what-
Pentatonix still going acapella though this is way too good to be acapella
Pentatonix! You blow my mind everytime you breathe new life into music!
nice cute
I want this to never end
Would have preferred this without the digital effects on the voices - I know that's how it sounds on Believe but Believe has instruments too, the point is meant to be voice and voice alone.
Pentatonix got a bit stale for me for a while, but this is juicy as the day I pressed that subscribe button :D great job!
Goosebumps moments here..love from Kenya
Dance dance mix is amezing 💖 Lets dance
We can use this as we dance
Amazing
I need a full version of Sonique - It feels so good! 🙌🏼🔥
oh it’s amazing 😍 as usual
Literally want full versions to every single one of theses.
You guys just always kill it.  All kinds of impressive, gang.
PLs pls pls pls make a full version of each songs... A lot of fans would be glad...
That transition from boom boom to SONIQUE was Epic. I wanna hear their full songs
I Lovee you ptx!! This is gonna be my song of the month
👏 👏 👏  it’s amazing
🥰🥰
To much autotune
Hay algo que Pentatonix no haga bien!? ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙆🏻‍♀️🇲🇽😍🤙🏻
Love them
Omgggg
Very very good disco remix 👍👍👍👏👏👏 #dj #disco #discoclub #entertainment #radio #host #ellen #shirts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl0F875NU14
What happened to the guy with the deep voice?
Love love love!!! Pentatonix soundtrack time-travel!!! <3 So damn good!!!
THEY ARE BACK KINGS AND QUEEN 🤍
Pls do 80s and 00s🤩
The beginning is a masterpiece!
So nostalgic....those songs that you have grown up....I missed that day... That I can go around without thinking who has covid
I just noticed Mitch didn't move his hands up, not even once
みんなおしゃれでかわいい☺️
Can't imagine I would see them finally do "Believe" by Cher. It is supposed to be their Guilty Pleasure song in the Sing Off. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_YcIaWirew
Believe was beautiful 😍
Фантастичні як завжди 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too much reverb, to much mastering, to much production.  I like the more real voctave sound.  You can barely make out the character of the different voices. Sound is close to a plugin.  It lacs character.
Fantastics💞😘
I do need a full version of every time we touch
Omg Kevin in Everybody Dance Now! That Synth beat! And the Sonique was sic!! 💜😘💕🥰
what happened to that other guy who was part of the group, who had a beard?
To think that the trends of EVERYTHING that’s based on the magical 90’s! Soooo awesome!
def gotta listen to this on headphones
Omg im lovin this so much!
I love it... 😍 so perfect!
LIVING FOR ALL THIS KIRSTIE FEATURES
Show me love was my favorite!!
Petition they do an 80s/90s album! Amazing gang🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Try not to sing! 0% Win.🎤
this will be the last track I listen to before I die
The 90's J-Lo look is POPPIN
I love them so much!! ❤️❤️
Just want to say because i have seen this at a couple of other 90s mashups but Cascada's "Everytime we touch" is NOT 90s. It was released in 2005. Please I take my pop culture timeline very seriously and just because it might have 90s sounding elements on the song I won't stand for this pop culture revisionism. I repeat please keep Cascada's "Everytime we touch" in the 2000s because that is where it belongs!
I'm here from the a capella show they were on that only ran one season or something. 🤣
Muito bom hein!
🥰
I love mustache Mitch
Just perfect
Wooooow 🙌🙌🙌I am speechless.
Please do a cher medley
I feel so old damn 😭
So irre habe ich diesen Synthesizer Sound noch nicht gehört, klingt irgendwie sehr schräg  in den Ohren,aber faszinierend, also danke
Gentee Sonique Feel so good ❤️❤️❤️ 2:00
wtf i love 90s dance songs now
Kirsten can get it
Their studio stuff sounds so incredibly faked
❤️
Pentatonic is such a talented group they need to be on more shows on tv .
I just love Pentatonix. Nothing out there like you guys. So fresh!!
Love it <3
everytime we touch!
❤❤❤❤❤PTX❤❤❤❤❤
teclado lindinho 2009
mitch looks like tony montana meets ron jeremy
Why do i hear a hint of AutoTune???
My teenage years in 5 minutes and 35 seconds. And can we talk about how Mitch's voice WAS MADE for 90s music?!? My God...
Show! Dancei muito ao som desses hinos dos anos 90❣️❣️❣️
4:38 fantástico! <3
Blue (Da Ba Dee) OMG <3 <3 <3
Kristin's face looks sooo bad now. Can't even tell if shes singing. just looks like plastic.
Pentatonix, making everyone Bi since 2011.
But seriously though: why they all look so gorgeous? 🥰🥰🥰
1:17 THAT BEAT IS INSANEEEE

I love this One ! Thanks you very much from 🇫🇷 !
Perfeito 👏 👏 👏 👏
Please Give credit to Maggie Reilly - Everytime We Touch For the original song in 1992. Cascada made a cover while great in 2006.
Blow un My mind
This is exactly what I needed especially on depression days
Todos os 5 estão muito fofos e como sempre cantando lindamente <3
Also why did Mitch decide to grow that gross moustache?
I clicked this video for one reason. I'm waiting for it... Waiting for it........ There it is 02:56
Starting off with such a HITTTTTTTTTTTT
Full version of Blue please!
Love Scott's Glasses @ 3:15, I gotta get me a set of those!!
Im seeing a Freddy mercury look😊😊
damn. so good. u guys are flawless
I still don't understand why Pentatonix doesn't rule the world of music. They would rock with original songs.
i dont know who disliked but get your ears fixed .
Wow. This was amazing.
This party would be dope!
Waaawww
Buena selección de temas, son secos
i need 80s versiooon
Matt!!! So much yes. More solos please!
I am obsessed with this, i already see this a thousand times no joke
❤❤❤
DANG!  Pentatonix - You Just TOTALLY BLEW THAT OFF OF THE MAP!! (As you usually do!!)  AWESOME!!
No Madonna Vogue? Other than that, amazing as always
I was freaking waiting for thiiiiissssss
i wish they would do a pentatonix medley , yeah as in their own songs !! <3
Since when did ptx have 2 black guys...?
Amazing!!!!
BONESSSS
Ok now do the full version of each song!!!
Nice💜💜💜
Good old times !
I am Just need avi...... 😩😩😩😩
Am born in 1988, so I grew up with this music. So much nostalgia, I love it :D
A few of these songs are not 90's
Amazing ❤❤❤
Auto tune was too much
Super!!!! ❤️
Everytime we Touch (the Dance Version by Cascada) came out in 2006... the Original by Maggie Reilly came out in 1992... but wasn't Dance at all
❤️❤️❤️
Back when life was great and no one had a care in the world. The 90s!
<3 <3 <3
the only problem with this video is that it ends
I miss "The music's got me" of Bass Bumpers
Just superb!
When the “I’m blue” hit  I felt alive
Platinium
Вы супер!!!)))
Omggg 🙈😱
Cool 👍🏿😎
I want Kirstin to be my mother and sing to me at night
WOOOOW! Best cover!
ОГОНЬ!!!
Perfect choice. Great sound. Amazing
This is soooooo freaking AWESOME!!!!! Thank you so, so, so much, guys! I love this mix - it makes me smile and young again. Even the silliest songs (Boom Boom Boom Boom - seriously, how could we, children of the 90-s make this song a hit?!) sound like pure perfection. I have goosebumps all over my body and air balloons in my stomach at the same time. Wanna cry, wanna dance, wanna laugh out loud. You are genuine magicians :)
5:04 transition is sooo smooth. Props to the editor(s) for keeping up with the awesomeness of PTX.
I was waiting for Macarena coming  up.
this is awesome! I didn't want the video to end
Pentaxional
PLEASE do a full version of Better off Alone I BEG YOU
Thank you for this blessing
Wtf happened to the girl. She looks old what did she do to her face
YOU NEVER SAID GOODBYE -?? You never said I’m leaving You never said goodbye. You were gone before I knew it And only God knows why.  In life I loved you completely  In death I love you still. In my heart I hold a place That only you can fill.  It broke my heart to lose you But I know you’re not alone. A part of me left with you On the day God called you home.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !  By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!
I went to the Iowa state fair concert a few years back and it’s so nice to see you guys growing
Pentotonix u are the best singers in the WORLDDDD
2:29
Great job you guys. I grew up in the 90's so this one means a lot to me. 🙂🙂🙂💗💗💗⭐⭐⭐
These old style medleys is what we live for
Jesrescie zje,,,, fajni. Cudowni
0:53 he sang this highnote like it's nothing. wtf I am amazed. like i have tears in my eyes
Tbh i really want them to do a "im blue" cover ^^
Guys, please let's make this masterpiece trend and hit!!!
They came to Brazil and I couldn't go 😕
Por que no puedo reventar el botón de Me gusta?
This is my favorite video ever. Need a full album of these and more!
I love 🥰🥰🥰🥰
They've raised the standard for their music/covers SO high and still, with their new content, they keep knocking it out of the park! Amazing!
for a 90s guy like me: that was amazing
So close to 20 million subs! You can do it!
Kistier is looking like Madonna in the movie "Looking for Susie. She's beautiful and she's talented. Everyone is.
I got so much joy from “Believe”!  So much nostalgia! When they were on The Sing-Off, week 4 was Guilty Pleasure week, and they couldn’t make “Believe” work. It ended up working out, because we got “Video Killed the Radio Star” out of it, but I was always sad that we never got to hear them do “Believe.” Now we have! I knew that they would kill it!
Came here for the Everytime we Touch song comments.... Niiice
So which ones gay coz they all act like gays lol
Fav thing about this video (hard to pick since there are a lot of amazing parts) is that Mitch looks happy.
Kirsten with that haircut looks like that one cool badass aunt at family gatherings who your parents tell you to avoid
Wonderful! Love ya!! XOXOXOXOXOXOXOOX
Im blue daba di daba dai
Petition for a complete 90s Dance Cover Album
Please do a full cover of Sonique's Feels so good
Full cover of cher's Believe please and thank you
Oh please do 00's medley next
Saying that they nailed this would be an understatement
Not to mention... everyone looks and sounds amazing 🔥🔥🔥 love you guys!!
Omg! Thank you! Emotions ❤️🔊
OMFG FROM THE FIRST TWO NOTES I WAS LIKE YES!!!!!!!!!! I’m in love 🌈😭😭😭
0:20
some times I was like : "what the F is james corden doing there?"
4:02 matt’s solo literally almost made me cry-
this made me realize what a gem cascada was omg
Everytime We Touch came out in 2006, it needs to say 90s 2000s mix
I'm becoming more and more obsessed with this gorgeous piece of art!!
1:38​ Boom Boom Boom Boom 2:55​ Blue Da ba dee  😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
i love you so much when i started to flowing you changed 3 years in my life but in a good way
No "Real Love", "No Diggity" or "This is How We Do It"?? No Erasure?? Wt???
Porque?  Osea quien los asesorará con la imagen. Tan bien que se veían al iniciar su carrera Mitch se ve fatal y sin criticar ese look que creo a nadie le queda se ve enfermo fatal. Y kristin ya empezó a inyectarse cosas. La boca de bagre no es sexy. Tan joven y sin necesidad. Sus voces son hermosas pero distrae lo que le están haciendo a su imagen 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
2:41  Cinta satu malam Oh indahnyaa.. Salam from wkwkwk land
OMG, I love this song. You can try to put that song in Spotify?. You're fantastic.
This is fire omg 😍🔥
great job, well done
Full album needed, this was awesome!
усатая девочка их 90ых тут самая красивая
wowowowowo.... SUPER, CADA VEZ QUE LOS ESCUCHO ME ENAMORA MAS SUS VOCES, EL TALENTO GRANDIOSO QUE TIENEN. GRACIAS POR LLENAR LA VIDA DE TAN BUENAS MELODIAS. BUENA VIBRA
I don't usually question my sexuality, till Kirstin starts bouncing her curls and what not... but then I see Scott do his glasses move and I know lol
Perfect!
Wow, all I can say is thank you for the wonderfully cool trip down memory lane.
BSB MEDLEY PLEASEEEEE!!!
Mitch was made for it omgggg
Fantástico
Make me realise I miss all these songs!
She has Gabrielle Tattoo?
This is Epic🌹
Awesome! Awesome! ❤️
Such a jaaam
The is pure quality 90 dance medley content 👌 I know almost all of these songs, I'm having so much nostalgia!!!
I play this everyday! Hahahaha
3:00 lmao that was my jam and it is still on my phone
On the phrase everybody dance now. Mitch's voice was PERFECT
Sales of these songs probably just went through the roof
scotts serving with the diamond glasses yes mam
Swear. Every version of the songs here has the potential to become a tiktok sound.
this song is kind of everywhere. Good choices and good sounds it's just hard to vibe when the vibe keeps changing so frequently.
All of them are my favourite songs
Please do a full Cher mash up!!!
when vengaboys came up i started dancing
Pentatonix did it first, sorry Rupaul.
i /we/ need every single cover of these songs, amazing!
THIS IS THE PENTATONIX I HAVE MISSED
UFFFFFFFFFFFFFF THIS IS AMAZING BRO♥
Потрясающе!
Y'all can't deny the transitions amped up the feeling to a whole other level 👌👌 damn those editing skills 😌
Kristen needs to stop with the lip fillers and Mitch really needs to ditch the 70's Porn Star look.
Good stuff just obviously not full enough not having Avi.  Bass is a bit weak.
Cher medley
KIRSTIN IS SO GORGEOUS HERE OMGGG SHE'S KILLING IT LOVE U GHUYSSS
Loved the autotone
¡¡Los mejores sin duda!!
0:37 I was like "wait a minute, Ava Max isn't 90's.... ohhhhh this isn't originally her"
очень классно!!!!
Being a 90s kid, I pushed LIKE in the first three seconds.
Класс)))))
Please do every song separately ahhh this is so amazing omg guys ahhhhh <333333
Manage to memorise this song in 1 day heheheh hbu?
2:48 Kristen says "Can't you feel my" in the video but "Can't you hear my" in the recording. Just thought I'd point it out coz I noticed it 😇
its amazing how happy kevin and matt are while beatboxing
so much work, wow, very very good, I love it, really great job!!!
Love this SO much. Makes me remember sunday mornings cleaning the apartment with my mom while she blasted her dance mix CD's
I WAS GROOVING TOO MUCH
Please PENTATONIX do some cover of Celine Dion song 💯❤️❤️❤️ It will be great 🙏🏻
Mane I'm a 2003 baby but I grew up with this music and even now, my parents love blasting 90's and 80's music when we need to clean the house 🥺🙏🏽 I feel nostalgic, love this era so much <3 PTX never fails to sound amazing
pure talent love it!
How I lo ve you Mitch smiling in this video!!! Thank you for your music and your effort!!
I miss her thin lips. Looked more like her beautiful self.
Let’s fucking gooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥
every time I see mitch, my world melts 🖤 i love you MIIIIITCH 🖤
I love this video and I love Kirstie’s hair
Congratulations guys you are awesome 👏👏👏👏
My favorite acapella band singing my childhood and teen years back to me is so unreal, I don't even know what to say. This was so fucking dope. Scott's Vanilla Ice sunglasses are a total mood :D As a child of Eurodance, this was pure joy for me :D Although I missed me some Ace of Base in the mix.   Thank you so much and hopefully, once this whole... thing has blown over, I'll see you in Germany again one day <3
WAY TO GO MESSI
Byutiful
I NEED a full version of believe
I want more....
The Cascada - Everytime We Touch part make me goosebumps. OMG!! That song is really mean to me.

PEERIOD

Amazing!!
You had me with Believe by Cher 😍 You guys are one of a kind! 👌
4:15 Hey wtf is that!!!
OBSESSED WITH MITCH’S TRANSITIONS
Did she give a birth? She is so beautiful
You guys are so talented, so awesome👏👏👏. This is another great video❤️, music to my ears🤗
Dang it! Goosebumps everywhere, 🤩🤩🤩
Whoever's the editor and/or audio mixer deserves an award xD
YES!!!
Brings me back when exercising.... I love it when I do my workout
Классно
Wear pink in next video if you guys are the Russian dolls
This was a far harder nostalgia hit than I expected.  I feel old.
The worst part in this medley is the part where it's ending
They Rock😀
Great ! I love it !
Feed Me All Of The Decades 😯 Please!
why do they look like they all shop from H&M
I would like it if they sung Lollipop from Planet 51. I think they could do great at it. They’re awesome.
Ya'll need to do full covers of some of these. Esp Everytime we touch and Believe 😍😍😍😍
Hearing acapella version of meme songs absolutely blasted my top off (in a good way!)
The most biggest rush of nostalgia hit me so hard I almost fell off the couch.. My heart is soooo warm right now. I love this so much! PTX! I love you guys!
When the nostalgia punches you in the face
Love PTX. Would have loved Melody of Love & I Will Go With You in the mix. Both DONNA SUMMER.
I'm having a nostalgic 90's baby moment....
That part when Kirstin sings Rhythm is a Dancer.. Damn I just fell in love.
Very cool but please sis... please stop with the plastic surgery.....it’s getting bad
Even I got hit with a wave of nostalgia and I wasn't even alive in the 90s.
Nostolga.
Full version of Finally, please!
❤🎉🤟🤟🤟Gänsehaut!Ich liebe einfach was Sie tun.🙃
Anyone else catch themselves just singing along without even really stopping to think about it?
what's the title of the first song?
I wonder who can go higher, Kirsten or Mitch.
I actually felt like I was back in college!  Going to the club with my friends and dancing to these songs ALL night!
Their vocals are so good, that they can sing in autotune,
I would have died if they started singing numa numa
Oh my god... this is must be a near death experience... I saw my whole life going through a light tunnel... I want this medley at my funerals!!
God the lip injections are getting worse lol
Everyone in their mid 40's+ is feeling quite nostalgic right now...
i will never EVER get tired of this!!!
I love you all so much! Please do a BTS, MAMAMOO and KPOP medley!
Diras 90s y 2000s por que Cascada es de los 2000s
OMG I love it !
EXCELENTE CASI IGUAL DE BUENO QUE EL DE DAFT PUNK <3
90s Dance Medley without AQUA? It's a nonsense.
Flashback to my JrHigh and High School days in the 90's😊😌
More like 90's to Early 2000's
Wow my entire childhood in 6 minutes!
I'M BURNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow, unbelievable we need an album with full versions of these songs!
Pentatonix  I was born July 17th 1990 and y'all brought me back to my childhood ¡I FEEL FUCKIN OLD  AND A BITCH IS TURNING 31 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR WTF LOL!, awsome tribute to  90s dancing music , I love it, greetings from lima perú

Johnny bravo.
I knew I’m blue was going to be on here!
At 2:14, I thought Cascada's song Everytime We Touch was in the 2000s not 1990s. It came out at least in 2005.
I'm seeing lots of petitions, but nobody is asking for country music 😢 and omg they are so good for that genre 😍
WOW MY FAV THUS FAR.
oh. that’s the name of that song...
Thank you for the flash backs.
Oh myyyy fckiiiiing goodness!!!!!😍💓🔥💯
mitchs vice is just amazing i love him I love all of them
They’re back at it again with those medleys!
Omg love this so much!! The 90's were awesome and this brought me back to the good days!! 💜
Y'all really captured it even though y'all was babies toward the *end* of the decade.
I absolutely love them, they are amazing as usual :)
Avi...you are greatly missed.

So perfect 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Hit me right in my childhood 💜💜💜
All the 90's kids feeling old yet? 😂
Enchem meu coração de amor e música <3 Arrasam!
Suddenly Im a kid again. I go with my parents in our 'mighty' FSO Polonez for holidays, my dad entertain me with 'what is the make and model of the car' thats in front of us, my mom hums the hits playing in the radio, all is perfect again :) Thanks PTX for that little jurney to the 'better times' :)

Every single song in this medley is my jam, even songs I had forgotten about. Amazing talent.
This is amazing! You guys are incredibly talented <3
Kirsten is just better than any other woman.
Impossível assistir o vídeo uma vez só, já tô na 1000000000.... Vez e não me canso ❣️🤙🏼.
This is just perfect!  .... awesome !
Why Ace of Base so short ;( I need more now.. As milenial kid it brought many memories!
Oh my...I felt young again. I really hope the 90's music style comes back for good.
Merci vous êtes tous fantastique ✨💕🎵🎶🎵💕✨🎵🎶🎵💕✨💕👣💕👣✨
I loved everything, your looks, your voices and the song choices, I love 90's dance music so much, and you made it feel as special as it feels for me, so soulful and dynamic.
okay but their version of every time we touch... I GOT ACTUAL CHILLS their harmonies just everything was amazing
Como assim, por um segundo eu vi a anitta KKK
Oh the nostalgia 😩😩👌🏻👌🏻
she looks like Tony Braxton🤪
spotify?
I appreciate this one 🙏, I'm an 89's kid 🙌🙌
1:53 is mind blowing
Fantastic I absolutely love this
So...Good...
Their style is everything I hate about today’s generation.
I understand that it´s alot to ask but it would be amazing to have full covers of all these songs, maybe even in an album
It Feels So Good - Sonique Full Version pls
me  once again unable to understand where kevin breathes in any live performance
Can anyone please explain what happened to Superfruit?
I miss so much my Superfruit 😩💔

Can they release an album covering every single one of these in their entirety? Please?
Where is Gigi d'Agostino? 😛😛😛
Love it! Please make the full version of “Everytime We Touch” ♥️
90s - that's when EUROPEAN music was ruling over US 😁
PETITION FOR PENTATONIX TO DO SECOND PART OF THIS MEDLEY!
gotta say from an old woman, you folks made my Friday afternoon.  Loved listening and watching you all SMILE.   Thanks so much,

MITCH. That is the comment ✨
I didn't know I needed this so much! I was born in the 80s, so this brought back some serious nostalgia! 😱😭😍
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 When covid-19 is gone, please come to Finland!
Cover for cher Believe please
Could use a little more auto tune
OMG KIRSTY'S HAIR EUFBIQEFVPQEF I CAN'T
Sonique. Entire track please. That was just magnificent!
WHERE'S THE EXTENDED VERSION OF THIS?! 5 MINS ARE NEVER ENOUGHHHHHH! 😩❤️
Nobody: "What would a sexy Adam Connover look like?"  Scott: "Hold my beer."
Born in '85, so I've grown up with that kind of music.  That. Was. Awesome! Thank you so much PTX!
The fact that this @PTXofficial 90's Dance Medley is literally my daily tracklist affirms I'm doing music right. I owe it to my daughters.   Also, 1:53 is INSANE!
Please release this on itunes uk!!!
J'adore tout simplement 😍👍😃
Yess! Great ! Now i know what songs i need to re-listen again ;-)   .. get out the stretchy gym suit to workout in ;-)
THE OUTFITS, THE VOCALS, THE HAIR, THE BEATBOX, LITERALLY EVERYTHING, YOU GUYS MEAN HOME TO ME
URGH I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH
You are the best, but sing in Slavic because English is easy to sing. Maybe Polish or Russian? Good luck.
Epic
This video was just amazing. Pleaseeeeeee give me some hope for the full versions
AMAZING! As usual
Ohhh, I was back to my teenage years for a couple of minutes, thank you for the trip down memory lane!! You killed it with this medley. Again. As usual <3
Just a small idea, you could make the full version cover of every song and make an album.
When she started singing everytime we touch was brilliant
Kind of want to hear their full cover version of "Believe" by Cher
I need a cover for every somg pleaseeeeeee
This is amazinggggggg
Omgggggg
Please make a full version of Blue, it´s so amazing and unique!

I love that the camera switches between them at the rhythm of the beat. :)
Wow you are alive!
OMG,I adore this! Just INCREDIBLE!

Amazing job!!!!!
I'm gasping for breath. Every.song from my college days. Oh God...I'm 51 now...lol. Loved every moment and every chord. You all really lit up memory lane for me. Thank you!
The autotune is really not needed
I am asking all known musicians to choose their most inspirational song and record it it isiZulu and Swahili to promote girls’ education!
you guys are geniuses and deserve all the success and love
The best age!!!!!!
Can't wait for 2000s rnb🙏🙏❤️
Amazing job guys!!!!😍
I agree we need everytime we touch and believe.
So now we're doing 90's flash back and nostalgia? Okay, i'm feeling old now.  But i loved this Medley.
i NEED a full cover of “believe” and “everytime we touch” ♥️
Awesome :D
Eurovision medley please !!!!
Why does he/she have a feminine voice? Was she/he a girl at birth?

Pentatonix  please pray for my cat he has mange
OMFG I thought NO way can she get any hotter then she curls her hair.
Minus the 1st song, love this mash-up 😀❤.  Since the majority sung was all of my favorite techno jams! I grew up listening 🎶 to all these icons!
Cascada was in the 2000's not the 90's

Cinta satu malam oh indahnya , cinta satu malam buat ku melayang ~~~
Necesito cada cancion en sus versiones, haria la vida mas lindaaa. Me encantaron todas, las necesitoooo 1 por 1, por favor
Birileri demiş öldü söyleyin onlara kral geri döndü
Wonderfull!!! I loved it!!!
This is awesome!!!
D4amn amazing

cinta satu malam oh indahnya~
I didn't know that Miss Cracker was a member of Pentatonix LOL omg I'm so shady 😂😂😂😂 anyways this is a Masterpiece!!! I LOVE IT 💖!!!!!
Little Louie Vega instead of Ultra Naté - Free...? Please, why didn't you cover Free? One of the best dance classics from late 90s. Timeless.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAZING
You make me feel 90's, I wanna dance now!! Thaks!!!! 🎶🎵
Mitch looks like freddie mercury with the stache
I love it!! I love it a little less it made me feel so old
All I have to say is WOW! Considering they don't use instruments. PTX is one of a kind.
where is Corona - The Rhythm Of The Night ? Erasure - I Love To Hate You ? Masterboy - Generation Of Love ? :((((((((((((
come on spotifyyy :(((
THIS IS SO FRICKEN GOOD OMG
This is frickin amazing!!!
OMG!!!!!! Para escucharlo 10 veces seguidas
I’m still waiting for a panic at the disco medley! If they can do *NSYNC, why not a panic medley?
I love Kristen's look in this video 🥰 That hair!!
Whole version of "Cher - Believe", please! <3
omg Cascada was really THE moment in europe back in the day!!!
He starts to remind me of Corden. XD
Omg😂😂 Scott those shades 😂😂😂
❤❤❤👏👏👏
A-MA-ZI-NG as allways! The video presentation was energyzing!!!
They always made me blown away.... no acapella groups in the world like them.... hope they always together and be the one forever...i love them so much..Gby Px
Please, put it on Deezer too.
Always a pleasure to see the elite smashing it effortlessly as always!! 👏👏👏💯💯💯 Y’ALL ARE AWESOME!! xoxoxoxoxo
Please, make Believe complete!!!!
ace of base yasssss
Great Songs,ones l haven't heard for a while.Cool.x
GOD. DAMN.
Awesome! But....not a single MJ or Primce song? 😭😭😭
I'm from 00', and I know 90℅ this hits
PENTATONIX=PERFECT PERIODT
😍 😍 😍
The insane beatboxing Kevin does on Everybody Dance Now needs to appreciated more
Saves me from a rough day and put a smile on my face 💕
This video has one downside - it's too short.
So cool
B-believe.....I- Wait....!!  H....HE SOUNDS SO GOOD. WAIT! MY HEART!~♡ AGH!  (My childhood just came running back. XD)
I am begging. Plase make full versions of ALL those songs T_T Th nostalgia, the feels!
i havent listened to this beautiful group in a minute, so happy they were in my recommended :))
This video is pure gold
I'm gonna need this whole thing on a CD for car rides lol
0:20 All i can picture is them singing woah is me XD
definetely want more medley .... i was addict <3 <3 <3 <3 !!!
And I was like “Emilio”!! The mighty duck man I swear to God.
I love Pentatonix so much!♥️♥️♥️
This is FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE 🔥
wow its really good especially the rythm
I don't actually comment very often, but this is sooo super-mega-cool! 😎 Greetings from Germany 👋🏼💃🏼🕺🏼
Beautiful, beautiful, and bravo, bravo!
Kristen stole the show on this one
YES THIS WAS THE ONE!!!! ♫
that beat drop tho
LOVE IT :)
I kinda needed this today
2:15 Cinta Satu Malam wkwk
This is suchhhh a good medley. Sooo nice
I liked that some of the editing was synced to the beat of the song. Good job, editor. I would like to point out 0:37-0:45 2:42-2:49 0:21-0:29
Love this  Medleys are the best
Idea for Pentatonix: Do a medley of the songs from your newest The Lucky Ones album plsssss
This gave me all the live! I didn’t know I needed this in 2021 but thank you for figuring that out for me! I will  blasting this all summer!
Can they do every song for it's own xD! Would be awesome!!!!
How the hell they are doing this!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?! Brilliant
OMG! wow, talk about walking down memory lane.  I was in my 20's in the 90's & that was definitely my clubbing years. awesome medley & nice homage to Cher too. you guys rock
Kristin-Nailed it Mitch-Killed it  Kevin-No words  Me-died listening it
Why is this song so amazing!!!!
They would finish it with "This is your night" or "Rhythm of the night"
I feel some what not annoying and upset I born in 1981. 80s and 90s are my kind of era and all of the music in this video are iconic and legend my my my favourite. Would you be able to release full new album, instead of 5sec on each song ugh. Full length of all of the song you sang in this video please please please? I'm willing to pay full price for it. Lots of love Pentatonix missed your exmate too.
I love the medley.  I know I would love 💘 the full versions of each of these songs better.
❤❤❤ Wow Cher
Who else is 30 years of age in 2021 or will be? Lol this is GREAT 👍 👌👏💯  Edited to add: EVERY BODY DANCE NOW 😆😃
need full version of everytime we touch and I'm Blue
can we take a minute and appreciate how much better music was in the 90s.
Hmmm aren't a large percentage of these songs from the early 2000's not 90's? 🤔
1 hour 90s medley please :)
Full Cover of "Believe" please!!!
ppfffffffff yaaa
Обожаю вас!!
Huauuuu!!!
Simplemente Pentatonix.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a throwback 🥺
Great job guys … love this!
OMG how did they bring all that song together....it's bring back all the memories, so nostalgic. With beautiful harmonies
these are the songs of my people...
This. Is. Amazing!  Kudos, Pentatonix! As a 90's kid, you really threw it out of the park.  Great job!
Where did Scott get those glasses?
0:15 the guy that always steals the pretty girls in class
AWESOME !!!!
PTX once again I’m blown away ❤️🔥🔥
I watch there videos way more than I probably should..addicted!
WOW thats BRILLIANT NICE ONE. ......
HOHMUHGAHD...Nostalgia😍epic 90s songs🤩Scott's 👏 Sunglasses 👏 ...YUSSSS 😎
They need to do full versions of these songs , they are amazing
Los chicos de Pentatonix SON ARTE en su máxima expresión 💜🔥🎆💎
Can I like this video like a million times?? This was absolutely amazing! It brought back wonderful childhood memories❤️
0:42  Me: “I’m blue-“ Mitch: “La La La La La” Me: “La La La La La”
Ok I see you Scott with the strand of hair casually falling down in front of your face!
Amazing
Love this!!! Makes me excited for some reason - brings back good memories 🔥❤️
As always, SO FREAKING GOOD. The LGBT greatest dance hits of the 90'.s Impeccable. And we NEED a full length Finally with Scott living it. Mitch's look is the best yet.
🥰🥰
Laying in bed about to sleep then I saw this. You got me dancing in my sheets!  Love it.
This is cool, but the 90s weren’t.  Love, a GenXer.
sonique it feels so good ... sounds so good too~♫
Forgot how much I love 2:11 song . Ahhhhhhhh
Kirstie lips seems not unusual..did he do surgery or kind a makeup?
A Full version of Believe please. Thank you, you're welcome ❤️❤️❤️👋🏽
I need them to do full versions of each song. Damn I felt transported to my 90s childhood.
Holy Crap Kirsten is the perfect 90s babe.
Lah ada Cinta Satu Malam
Waot. How long has Avi been out of the band????
Great Work👊🏾💥💚#Classic #Masterpiece
I could listen to Kirstin sing Every Time We Touch from now until forever
I never knew I needed this in my life
not me going FERAL at "Everytime we touch"
Absolute bangers
Ótimos, perfeitos... SENSACIONAL.
This is how everyone wants to feel now!!
Amazing!
Really killed it on the Everybody Dance Now.
Ich finde euch so super Irgend wann will ich euch auch mal live sehen <3 und die Songs sind einfach meine Kindheit
Brasil pede músicas de entradas de série, do tipo, Anne com E, outlander, ou até musicas do filme Eurovision da Netflix
I missed 'Freed from Desire'  by Gala. But this video is perfect. Good times. Good memories.
Bravo....bravo...👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
i don't want it to stop :(
OMGGGG
can we have a full version of show me love and it feels so good please and thank you.
Plot twist: this is a trailer for their new album “90’s Dance POP Hits”.
One Melanie martinez please!!!
OMG ¡impresionante! 🥰🥰
Totally forgot this came out. So glad I listened to it now :-)
Absolutely amazing. Thank you for releasing another bomb songgggg
Dat Mbappe
Raaveee whooop!!!! Was so caught up dancing and then it just ended
1:14....aquí viene lo bueno jóvenes...😂😂😂😂
Like reliving my youth. Good stuff! But I have never heard 1:52 or 3:11 in my life.
so much autotune, damn.
Mitch was made for this medley. No synth needed.  Ps. I literally had "do you believe in love" stuck in my head for 10 years. Please god I hope it hasn't come back after this.
WOW!! Outstanding! Love this!! ♥
FULL VERSION OF "EVERYTIME WITH TOUCH"
Can you imagine how many rights this song had to ask for?
This group bring me nostalgia of 2015 damn time run fast
I can't stop watching this
It's clear they dressed up as like 90's retro to match the songs they sung
Good ‘ol 90s and all the memories. Thanks PTX!
You know they are good but I don’t get the same vibe from them as I do from Home free or voice play.
After this and Coffee in Bed I think a New Jack Swing theme medley is required..
Maravilhoso. Pena q acaba!
🔥
ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT ♥♥♥
Omg a 90's album please. These would all be so amazing in full versions!
OH YEAH< Mitch be killing "Blue" :D
I need a full version of believe and Everytime we touch
i love this!!!! so much!!!
You hit me at my junior high and high school memories, great midley
Wow! That’s so amazing! I’m shaking me!
🔥 as usual.!!! You guys rock!!!!!
Matt doing the bass in "Boom boom" 🤯🤯 no way he's doing the octaves that's dope
Like my 50th time listening and I JUST remembered that they were supposed to do Believe by Cher when they were on the Sing Off! I knew their voices on it sounded familiar!
Fucking 🔥
Only thing wrong with this medley was why did they have to auto tune their voices, it’s takes away the fact they are an acapella group, a very talented acapella group
I miss Avi but they still kickin it!
As a 90’s Thank you for this! You guys killed it! Nostalgia af! Thank you! That was fire 🔥
I love PTX  i fron Brasil
Surreal! Maravilhosos!
AAHHH!!!!.. OMFG!!! you just brought back my teen life.... You better be coming to London soon...
I want the video "evolution of Lady GaGa"
Que espetáculo. Que show. Vocês são demais !!!
CTM los amo mucho pq son tan secos AAAAAAAAAAAAAA <3
The Scatman is missing!  And songs of Ace of Base.
love this but how can you do a 90s dance medley and leave out madonna???
Wowoowow 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Ahhhhhh es muy genial
Wooowwww
Amei esse feat. da Anitta na música :P
so good omg, haven't listened to anything this amazing in a while
Petition for 80s medley
4.04 Crushed it!
Please make an 90's R&B edition! 😍
Excellent

Вобще то классно )
Это девушка или парин?

This is AMAZING 🤩 You are all AMAZING 😍 and can we talk about those looks?! 😚🤌 Y'all fucking SLAYED the 90's dress code ✨✌🏻
I want Scott's square glasses
thank you! this is magic in a pandemi!
Need a full version of " be my lover"
Lekker treffer!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
See what she’s done with her face throughout the years... why?!
I've come to the conclusion that there isnt a song out there that they cant make better. Absolutely flawless...we are all blessed to experience PTX. Their overall talent is just unreal. Thanks and stay safe.
Los amoooo <3 :)
Just gotta love 90s dance music lol
My shower playlist for the next 5 months
Can you imagine if this was released as a single?! 😍
First time I listen to it and literaly been waiting for this ( 4:30 ) moment cause I new it would come
Shut up and take my money for a full album with these songs.
Scott's glasses and outfit gave me big time night at the Roxbury vibes 😆 especially when they sang wanna be my lover. All they needed was the head twitch and boom. Lol loved this and now I want to see that movie!
Руки вверх.  Супер
Is it sad I knew every one of these songs?...that I used to binge listen to on my totally legit and not pirated/burned walkman tapes and disc man cds. Oh and the radio/mtv of course! Oooooh the days before YouTube. How did we function without it I have no idea?!
This makes me feel good
I just remembered my whole childhood😍
Yo that outfit edit swype screen switch at 5:07 was done SO WELL.  Pssht the whole video was edited amazingly.
MORE!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Is this on Spotify?
I’m speechless! This was SO GREAT 🤩
2:14 cinta satu malam
Waste the click
smacznej KAWUSI życzę każdej osobie, która to czyta :)
I can’t wait for it to be over so I can listen to it again 17372990 times
I love Pentatonix and I liked the video and the music, but does medley mean something different now? Vast majority of these songs didn't go together, there were very few transitions that made any sense, and they certainly weren't ever combined to make something new. This was just skipping tracks in my '90s playlist after a couple of seconds each
FUNKY FRESH. Definitely turning this list of songs into a Spotify playlist.
Epic. I love you guys.
Holy freaking moly that was awesome
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
4:45 😍😍
0:52 i can't get over mitch's part
YEEEESSSSSSS!!!
I forgot how good music there was in the 90s!
Awesome guys!! As always!! <3
Love this, really made my day. Thank you.  ♥️🌻
The Sound of my youth. Epic. Once again PTX shows why they are the best acapella group around 👏👏👏👏👏
*Sooooo Nostalgic 90's forever the best music* ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
AND PUT THIS ON SPOTIFY PLEASE ILY ALL
PLEASE DO A FULL VERSION OF EVERYTIME WE TOUCH OMG OMG
That was beautiful 🤩🤩🤩
😇😇😇😇😇🤩🤩🤩🤩😛👽👽👽👽👽❤❤❤❤❤💥💥💥💥💥🤘👏👏👏👏👏👏
bravo !!
Oh holy crap...this is my childhooooood!
Alternate title: PTX covers the Night at the Roxbuy soundtrack
Absolutely amazing, loved it!
Can you make cover from get lucky? You're are AMAZING😍 edit: Kristie new hairstyle is so cool
Gg
Can i file a lawsuit against youtube for not recommending pentatonix 9 years ago? ;)
Its been a while
listen to all the original songs almost daily still
CANNOT WAIT FOR JUNE. i really hope it doesn't get canceled or delayed again i wanna see them live soo bad
Questa è musica... Come loro nessuno ❤️💪🏼
Literally perfection!! Thank you guys for this masterpiece!! <3
I was all right, here vibing until I hear "Everytime we touch" XD I just started fangirling so hard! I love that song!!!
PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish this video had lasted longer :((((
How Fun!!
CAUSE EVERY TIME WE TOUCH I GET THIS FEELING
I'm certainly not a hater, just the opposite, but the girl would have drawn even more lips.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oh my God Guys-you've made sooo many people so happy with this medley! It took me back to my school discos :-) Soooo many good memories!! It makes me feel old though ;-) I love you :-)
So Cool !!!
So it is absolutely amazing, obviously. I cannot watch the video because of her lipstick tho, it makes me uncomfortable :)
IM BLUE
i want more more more love it
OMGGG THIS IS AMAZING😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
SO GOOOOOD OMG!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
My 41 year old arse approves.
✨ Pure nostalgia ✨
Sorry, but this moustache is BEYOND ridiculous. Not 90s dance, but 80s cheap pimp style
This gave me nostalgia as these were the jams I used to vibe to, great work guys
I love you guys so much
Oh god, this is so epic! 😍
YEEEEZZZZZ now i NEED the complete version of the songs
You guys are so so great! Please do another one with 90s music.
Hello, greetings, Blessings from me, I wish you all the best, because you are not doing an a cappella cover with beatbox, of No Roots, by Alice Merton, what do you say?
Thank you for making my day! I'm still smiling. You guys are amazing!!
👏This 👏was 👏a 👏serve!
WTF is up with those goddamn lip injections? Looks unhealthy.
I love the song soo much! But does anyone talk about there appearances. Let’s start with Scott’s HAIR!!! ❤️❤️💙🤍
i got chills when they started singing everytime we touch... my childhood flashed before my eyes
I just flashed back to the skate rink. My childhood and tween years in a playlist.
This is just incredible! Don't even know how to properly describe it...
❤
What an amazing remix, pentatonix are the best
I love it!
Back to the Future.  I mean of course To the PAST, this was my childhood. Just Great what they did.
Wow
stuck at 2.43-2.5
Unfortunatelly Sooo Digital.I think doesnt have acapella soul.
every time yo are more and more perfect!!!  I love it!!!
Where is FREED FROM DESIRE?
I needed this more than i knew!!
All the tiktokers and memers are like "wait ik this song"
Everytime We Touch by Cascada is from 2006 though
Jesteści wspaniali
Scott looks so sexy!! He looks mysterious then when he smiles he looks so cute and adorable...Hey from Manchester 🇬🇧
PETITION FOR THE FULL COVERS FOR EACH SONG !!!
I need Believe and Show Me Love as a full version omg!!!!
How are y’all so good looking all the time.
I love it when they sang BLUE. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Make a 2nd version pls. You will give me meaning in life.
Thank you guys !!!!
I'm just going to overlook the fact that not all of these are 90s (looking at you in particular Everytime We Touch) because this is AMAZING. So talented!!! It had an extra level of fun for me because I haven't heard any of these songs in YEARS and yet I was still able to recognize each of them instantly and somehow still remember all the words lol
I dnt think there gonna be any other acapella band like Pentatonix
Congratulations by this moment! Viva 90's!
Arrechiiiiisiiimooooo!!!!😍😍😍😍
Wauu is that suuuuppperrrr
Let the party begin! 🤪
This is so good
I turn 30 next week and this was the best gift 💚
Жаль что нет Британи Спирс  …Baby One More Time
Please, please make a full version of "Every Time We Touch"!!! It was so great I almost melted... God, am I that old already? Anyways, great performances as always - gotta say, some were even better than the originals!!! Love you, Pentatonix!!!  P.S. I'm not the only one getting goosebumps while listening to their voices, right? I mean, that harmony is just divine!
I lost 2  bffs
Прекрасно 💓💓💓 Всегда заслушиваюсь их голосами. А здесь порадовали и погрузился в ностальгию,  спасибо вам за вашу работу.
That's amazing guys ! I really hope you'll make a version of Billie Eilish's songs 'Bury a friend' one day ! And Ava Max :')
Props for Props to Cher and the first use of Auto-Tune ever recorded on a record!!
Niceeee🔥🔥🔥🔥
I thought​ you guys gonna sing Butterfly​ too ay ay ay I'm your little​ butterfly. I love it anyway. Well done guys!
Awesome as always x
It's very very very COOOOLLLL!!!!
I just love the medleys the most 😍
💕💕💕 Brings back memories! Still listen to these songs
Whoa.... Hmmm, I remember having the single It’s a beautiful life on cassette in my truck! Had they Run Away in there that would have been an full high school to college throwback. This is AWESOME. Can’t wait for more of y’all!
Anyone else desperately want to hear/see a full PTX cover of Cher's Believe? That little clip at 4:02 in this montage was NOT ENOUGH!
🤍😄😃🤍
Wth?! No aqua?!
Faltou CORONA
I clicked hoping I'd hear vengaboys and I heard that and so much nostalgia as well 😭 ❤
Really wished that this was on Spotify! I love it ❤
SO. DAMN. GOOD!
Scott with sunglasses looks exactly like James Corden, ngl :)
I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU, IT´S SIMPLE......... ARE YOU HUMANS????
i need the sunglasses
The fastest like I have ever gave
Hii Pentatonix!! I am waiting for your revision to bts' dynamiteee
DARUDE SANDSTORM NEVER DIES!
Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! 90's kids be like damn matt voice is freaking great
This feels like the old music from Pentatonix! 😍
Jeees, my childhood just came back.  😍🤣🤣💙
1:23 OMG Her low voice is soooooo good
short hair suits Kirstie ngl 😳😍
So awesome!
Damn!🔥
nice groovy     from  japan
The goosebumps from nostalgia and amazing voices is PAINFUL!
PETITION for Pentatonix to make FULL VERSION OF "FREED FROM DESIRE" as a punishment for not having including it
Fantastico! Que recuerdos al escuchar este medley! Muy bueno!  Podriais hacer uno de los ochenta, por favor? 🙂
Okay can we all say that you guys slayed it and honestly I have the feeling you had the best vibes filming it.   Love and continue !!!
That was so amazing!! Please make the full version of all this songs. I like them more than the originals.
kristie singing everything we touch is everything
OMG!!!!!MY YOUTH!!!!!
Is it just me or Scot looks soooo as James Corden here?
2:14 song gives me chills everytime  just wow - I need a full version of this and/or Angel with a shotgun.... :O
Wow, your beautiful voices and smiles make us happy. Thank you !!
コメ欄制覇
YOU ALL ARE AMAZING 👏❤

THIS IS INCREDIBLE
BOOM! AMPUGA ANG GALING NAMAN! #allcapsforeffect meron kaya silang 80s?
Full version of Gypsy Woman!! Please please pleaseeeeee!!!
Since Cheerleader cover until now ❤️
The view for my ears and music to my eyes 💙
Amazing Amazing Amazing
❤️❤️
So the whole song i was questioning if there was a synth wave added to the vocals ( as per the songs that need it.) Cher sealed it though and obviously they are using it when its called for. Takes away from it.
Cannot wait for the full covers on these 90's songs.😻
Mitch's voice in electric tone is everything
I don’t know about you, but I just went on the most amazing nostalgic field trip 😂😂😂👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
By the ancients, I love your medleys.
Fantastic! Such a throwback from when I was growing up. Would love to see full versions of some of these songs :)
Des génies <3
Kristen you're beautiful the Way You are. I definitely like the lip filler but I wouldn't do any more.
Sensacional ❤️❤️❤️
Wow Spock can sing?
I also want to hear them sing Adam Lambert's version of Believe!
This is superb. I only wish it had Scatman.
Better off alone and Feels so good was crazyyyy
👍
wow!
OMG! I love this❤❤❤❤
Pentaholic 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️
I need playlist on spotify the souns 🤩
This has been so long overdue
This is really disappointing compared to other medleys of theirs. There is no attempt at a mashup.
Love love love kirstin fuller lips now
Unfortunately I'm bort at the end of 90s. If I was born at the 80s, I must've dancing like crazy 😅
OMG!!!!!❤️
Napaka angas talaga  😍😍😍😍😍😍
Best thing I've ever heard
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I'm a mess 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️ Edit; I need to download this for my workouts 💪🙌❤️
So I guess no one is talking about how Mitch's seems to be going for the Freddie Mercury look?
ЭТО ПРОСТО ПОТРЯСЯЮЩЕ!!! Я ПЛАЧУ!!!
Anyone able to catch me up on where Avi is?
One word: WOW!
Missing avi with them
GENIUS!!!
вааааааа годнота
Love it ❤️
Estoy en bucle con esto!!!! Madre mía, que buenos son!!!! OMG!!! in love total <3<3<3
Mbappe are u??? Are u also a Singer?
I love Kirstin's makeup 💁‍♀️
OMG! It is soooooo gooood! I play it on repeat i just can't stop it 🎶🎶🎶
everybody dance now - the best =D <3
❤
Where is Michael Jackson?
eargasmic..
I kinda dropped out of the fandom but i think i’m back omg
Want a full version of each :D
Incredible as always. But these are the only songs they play where I work so its so hard to not think of waiting tables :/
Waiting for the Jock Jams Megamix pls
Mitch is on different level! He's made for 90s! Great video guys!
"Believe"... Cher 😍😍👏👏
4:04 really got me 💜
Kirsten still pulling off looking like a different woman in every video.  Can't get enough of that side smile.
Can you do 80s version of this??? it would be amazing
😲 omg
... Did... Did she get a lip job??
Is sudden outfit change for me and the mouth beats 🔊 💜
Ayup! I am definitely bi. omfg
Jesus CHRIST!  Can Kirstin & Mitch get ... any ... hotter? I am a straight man & still almost fell out my chair with both their looks in this one.  GahtDAMN
Please do minefields by John Legend Faouzia cover🙏
Se pasan!! Fabuloso como siempre 😃🤩
Anyone thinks Kristen doesn’t need the fillers and was already looking bomb back then? It looks a bit unnatural on her and restricts her upper lip movement :/
As a 90s kid this must be one of my favourite medleys of yours🤩
ehhhh.... the cuts were bad imho. didnt like how none of it flowed.
Bring back avi
I LIKE  IT
finally ariel happen to me
🤩🤩🤩
'90sはビンゴすぎる… アップテンポはさすがの相性です…！ みなさんのリズムがビッチビチに合ってめちゃくちゃ耳が気持ちいい👂♪♪♪
❤️🇲🇽❤️😃✌🏻
Still waiting for the cover of "Wellerman".
this is sickkkkkk wow i love it
Just sitting here wondering why I wasn’t blessed with talent
また最高な・・・・(´;ω;｀)
This is so fuckin' amazing!  I love Pentatonix! <3
Pentatonix on the cusp of the trend. We are in a revival of 80's so 90's are next
These artists are so talented, I'd rather their voices stand on their own versus have so much editing. This is over produced.
Amazing! Please do a full version of Every time We Touch.
Love love this!!!  It was well needed! 💖
KIRSTIE WHY U MAKING MY GAY HEART GO STRAIGHT?? WTF I LOVE UUU ❤️✨😭🤧
When you're at a gay club but there's no electricity
Love you PENTATONIX!  Amazing as always!😊❤
Me Encantó Demasiado, saludos
STOP THIS IS SO GOOD
I would love a full version of 80’s and the 90’s. I was born in 1967, it would bring so many memories back.
Great mix
What about the 70th?  Please❣️
O.M.Geeeeeeee YES! YES! YEEEEEEESSSSS!
Kirstie looks like 'Scarlett Johansson' somehow. 🤔
Please come back to Argentina! I need and I want with all my heart to hear you!
Awesome medley as usuall - bravo
As always, it’s AMAZING! I wish it was longer! Just when I get into the way you perform my favorite songs, it switches. Can we get an extended remix of like 15 min. long?
80s next PLEASE !!!
Boom boom , do they have a full version, someone educate moi
Oh the nostalgia!!!!
I love you guys
I NEED a cascade cover of that song omg it was so good!
This is great BUT I prefer the other format. Like them being in the same room making the transitions. I feel this is TOO produced
We all need a “believe” solo version please!!! The world will thank you ♥️
So good.
How do I like this a million times??
WE STAN THE MULLET
Hm..Mitch looks..weird in the thumbnail🤔
really needed this , thank you
only negative thing is... AUTOTUNE WAS OBVIOUS THIS TIME!!! :, (
You guys are my absolute all-time favorite band! I apologize but I have to be honest with you and I know as artists you will appreciate my honesty..... I unfortunately did not like this particular video creation.  I definitely appreciate the incredibly hard work you've put into this video and all your others, but I just can't get behind this one. I think for me it was the song selections yes it is definitely "MY" stylistic opinion. That being said I am still a huge fan of all your vocals and you are still my all-time favorite band. Again just my honest opinion I just think it's the song selection I didn't like it was just  👌 to me. Usually your videos 💨 me away. I'm looking forward to your next video. Much love from Tampa Fl❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You guys always kill it! Perfect!
I’ve never heard them use so much editing before. There were parts where Mitch literally did not sound like himself. But this was amazing. Those are all great jams
SCOTT IS GIVING US SOME SUPERFRUIT VIBES :>
Amazing arrangement and vocal mastering. But how you gonna not include Aqua's Barbie Girl? #Iconic
This is so well-done!  I know every single song as a DJ.   Everytime We Touch by Cascada didn't come out in the 90's... it came out in 2006.
Finally after a long time...it felt like one more time
Such a talented group. That was so fun! 🎶 Brought me back to my college years. ❤️
How could you not like this
2000,s 🙏🙏🙏
Great, as always. But your clothes look more like from the 80's. :))
OMG! BRings back so many memories! THESE SONGS JUST MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD/HAPPY AND MAKE YOU WANNA SING AND DANCE!! SMILING Like crazy/singing/dancing along! THank you PTX!!
Kirstie's  hair and new look is amazing!💗
My teen years just flashed before my mind in 6 minutes... grooving at the basketball court with buddies after school, doing homework at McDonalds while chillin' with tunes, studying for tests in the evening with music playing off of my Sony walkman... man, I'm feeling old now.
JUST AMAZING
CAN WE TALK ABOUT KRISTIN’S HAIR🥺❤️❤️
no deee-lite...
I hope it’s not just me. But I want them to make a cover of the very last song
its like real instrument
I love Kirstie's short hair!
I'm in love with the mafian higher voice <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 be my mafian princess
SIIIICCCKKKK!!!
LoveLoveLove; got me movin’!❤️
Aaaai meu coração 🥰😻🇧🇷
didn't cascadas version of every time we touch come out in the 2000s?
2:15 Cinta satu malam 🕺
Ooof. Right in my youth. 💕
PENTATONIX, PLEASE, WHY NOT MAKE A FULL VERSIONS OF THE SONGS OF THE 90'S. PLEASE MAKE A REVIVAL OF THE WHOLE SONG.... 😍😍😍❤❤❤😊😊😊😉
Perpetual blue balls. Lol. Sounds good but I hate medleys because just as I'm getting into it the song changes.
THIS IS SO GOOD OMG ❤️🥺. And can we talk about the vocals? ✨majestic✨
Love it though, Casada's "Everytime We Touch" aint a 90s track love xxx
This is how I think I sound in the shower.
That's so dope , I wanna cry😪😪
😍whoever edited this needs a serious raise!🤯
I need an 80's Medley!!!!!
I've missed The rythm of the night 🥲
such a great group my god
NANANANANAN EN PIJA ESTAN
Everytime we touch isn't even a 90s song?
GET UP AND PARTY !!!
THIS IS SO GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!! IM IN LOVE
SO ICON AND GREAT !!!
They need to make an 80s dance medley 🥳🥳🥳
Is this a cappela?  Because I can't believe it 😅.
I'm a Zoomer ('99), and I only recognized, like, 2 of these, but I still enjoyed it immensely LOL!
Is that the same girl, or did she switch races?
1:51 How did they do THAT with just their voices?? I can't get my head around it
LOVE LOVE AND LOVE SOME MORE
Why isn't this on Spotify :(
Hey beutifull People! Me dear PTX... you are my soul's music... i'd love to listen you singing any mix of ABBA or QUEEN... well igual love to listen all your music...
Killed it
Each bit sounds fantastic, but you so captured that particular section of the Sonique track !
WOW guys, that was fantastic!!! 👍👏🤝 The CHER cover is simply outstanding! BRAVO!!! 👏👏👏
Oh my, maybe dating myself a little here, but this is throwback music for me - reminds me of all the times I went to the roller rink with my friends 😁  90s music had some fun jams for roller blading 💃🏻
90s and early 2000s Newgrounds
👍❤️❤️❤️👍
OMG! Memories!
Interesting. I grew up in the '90s and don't recognize most of these songs. One of them I didn't hear till the early '00s, so I didn't realize it was a '90s song. Another one I thought was from the '80s. 🤔
Didn’t know I needed a techno pentatonix album, but now I do! Awesome stuff
is 2021 another  renaissance period ? :D
They changed several members????
'Oh wow, I didn't realize how recent some of these songs were..."  *does the math*  "Oh... oh no...."
Please we need a 70's and 80's version
I sang EVERY word ! Such fire
THEY ARE STILL THE SAME BUT THE OLD PENTATONIX IS DIFFERENT FROM THIS PENTATONIX:<
!!!!!
Absolutely loved it!!!
This was pure nostalgia for me. Thank you for this gift! 😀
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, his moustache makes him look like a French movie villain
SO PERFECT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You guys should do the full version of believe 😍😍😍
love yalll and praying for yall
We need this music on planet Earth again 😭
I HOLLERED DURING THE CASCADA PART BUT THIS AIN'T A 90s SONG STOP 😭
When Matt smiles while he sings, it’s impossible not to smile too
I love Mitch's voice in the slightly lower register. Just as awesome as his high voice
OMG!!! KIRSTIN SOUNDS WAY THICKER HERE. Her voice is massive as heck. I'M IN LOVE
Am I the only one who thinks of “Priscilla Queen of the Desert” every time they hear “Finally”? 🙈
Jaw drop @ Sonique 😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯
sooo goood
I've missed this so much!!!💜👏👏👏👏🙏
I don't like how edited the voices sound. (yes even for do you believe in love after love) there are techniques do make your voicr sound like that
MAKE A FULL COVER OF EVERYTIME WE TOUCH PLZ THANK U
When is this going to be on Spotify though?!?!??!!!!
Хочу услышать полную версию It feels so good!
Been a silent fan for a few years of you guys...but these don't sound like normal human voices, so my request is...can you get back to non-synth made-up videos?
My heart neeed this <3
+1 to that Mercury Stache.
woohoo! so awesome!
This is a Jock Jams commercial....
Thumbnail looks like 5 people who get mad when their bespoke coffee is brewed wrong.
Major 90’s gay club vibes 😍🙌🏼🏳️‍🌈 Love it!!!
Fan fan fan muy fan 👌🎉🎊🎉
Kevin blows me away every time!
Noooooo. not finally 😠 Please don|t rape that song
You can see why they are the worlds greatest accappella group they just excel in everything thing they do
Maravilhoso aqui no Brasil.
Even in the most gayest of moments of late 90s, early 2000s, we were never this gay 🤣🙈
I heard someone needed a pearl necklace.. way ahead of ya!
Anybody want them to do a full album of 90s songs? Like below or comment
I've never heard a worse rendition of What Is Love...
Was born in 2001, french girl, and all these songs have been my childhood... what can i ask more?
Had a dance party getting ready for my night shift 💜
I just can't with how amazing Kristin looks!
mitch é tão perfeito
Woooooow😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fantastic ... but Cascada’s version of Everytime We Touch was from like 2006. So maybe credits should say Maggie Reilly for that one?
I didn't know "Everytime We Touch" by Cascada was the 90's. I thought it was early 2000's.
e eles entregam tudo e muito mais.  estou morrendo de vontade de ouvir cada uma das músicas enésimas vezes
Amazing!
I love it!!!!!!! Youre amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
please i need it live, like the evolution of music... Say a price we can get to it
The nostalgia is strong with this one
I could tell Mitch was living for the I'm Blue part!
This is awesome 👏 love the remix
THIS IS AMAZING!!! But how is this not on Spotify yet??? I need it!!
That CURLY hair OMG Kirs<3
When European music was actually considered cool, lol.
OK... But this is so good....
When is this going to be available on Spotify?? I am inlove with this medley!!!!
Some of this songs are not from the 90s, but I love them
"We are going to get into The Roxbury!"
My jaws dislocated so bad just watching this😆 so awesome 😎
Ngl the middle guy at the beginning looking like a btec joe exotic from tiger king lol
Suddenly everyone knows how to beatbox with this mash
Love blue ! 😂😂💙💙
С удовольствием послушала
4:30 replay button ur welcome

Thanks for that 😉 really great!!!
90’s songs are the best hand down. Thank  you for the memories.

И никто меня =))) вы просто супер
Для русских это просто хит

Woooooooow!!! 😍 Love it!!! 💪💕
Okay but like....WHO'S YOUR EDITOR?!?! THOSE TRANSITIONS WHERE FIRE 🔥
BLUE "DA BA DEE" FULL SONG PLEASE ♥♥♥
Autotune?? 😬🙈
THE OUTFITS
Mitch - the voice! 🤩😍❤️💋
i need all of these on a workout playlist for the workouts i never do!
Ахуенно
This 90's medley is awesome and timeless. Hence it even makes me want to go back to the 90's. In that decade, life was so more stressless and it was just a happy era, so much better than the present depressing times. Thank you for this medley Pentatonix, it reminds me how beautiful life was back then and hopefully it will all come back soon.
I miss these Mashups :)
I definitely was not expecting Sonique to be heard in this video!!! Ty so much
Where is "2Unlimited" Magic Friend or Tribal Dance?
Looks like Kirstie may have the beginnings of a full sleeve of tattoos. Opinions?
Nao sabia que o Matheus Carrilho entrou no Pentatonix
As always...LOVE IT
I absolutely adore their new album!  They are all amazing!!  Give them their Grammy now❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm blue, da ba dee da ba daa Da ba dee da ba daa 💙 The Best song
This is 100% pure talent, well done!😍😍👏👏
Why does Mitchi look like he charges too much rent.
I espessually like the "every time we touch I get this feeling" in full version
What voices.....really unbelievable.
Я ОБАЖАЮ его ТРЕКИ, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/T9KqeNyli9o
Pentatonix's last breathe.  This project is come its final! Originals songs are better!
A great performer, i love it, 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Já vás zbožnuju :)
Congratulations and Blessings. Your famulouss ! Kisses ! Love. Namaste.
685 people don’t know what real talent / music is.  This is brilliant ! 🤩🤩🤩 💯 💯 💯
I loved it! It was the mashup I didn't know I wanted/needed. Absolutely amazing.
I’m literally begging for a full version of rhythm is a dancer PLEASEEEE
First second and I was already screaming 💯❤️
App incredibox
Well this was a blast from my clubbing past!
Can we get LGBT Pride One
As soon as 'believe' started, I immediately thought of the film eurovision with will ferrell. 😉
Блин, я одна такая или когда смотришь, такое чувство, будто это какая-то новогодняя передача...
WTH, Be My Lover is my favorite Audition Ayodance Game! Miss it so much!
Just ART!
Beautiful songs
I'm waiting for Dr. JONES AND IM ALIVE 🤣🤣
0:28 My favorite song ❤️
They don't mixed well. The transitions between songs aren't smooth. Felt like cuts of full songs and put in together instead of a medley.
Awesome  Thanks
СУПЕР
Absolutely great. I enjoyed that a lot!
Owesome medley! Orgasm of my ears... =)
I like all of those original tunes, and I must say that they are already enough gay. These guys just made them extremely gay with their perfomnce. I don't like it.
I love this :)
Super 😍, więcej podobnych. Czekam na następny🥰😍!!!
I was waitin for L'amour Toujours  😢
And they dressed the part!!
PLEASE MAKE A ALBUM FULL OF THESE SONGS! Who doesnt like the 90's..... IM BEGGING!!! <3
Yeees i need to hear that as a full version, especially first tune 💜
This is the first time im angry with penta... (joking). Please remix this one EP minimun 30 minutes, I know you can do it kids! Im too old, this are my songs not enough just 5 mins... Ahhh and thanks specially for Sonique! Ofcourse i ll never give a dislike to ptx!
Who can ever give dislikes to this?
RHYTM IS A DANCER  ✨♥️🔥💃 THANKS FOR SO AMAZING VIBES💞💕🙏🙌
Please make a full version of "Everytime we touch"! That was amazing. And maybe you could a full versio of the others too... ☺
Faaantastic!
This was amazing I like it
You should do a freestyle medley
Jeez... Ur guys are always my memories. I've been ur fan a decade now. I wanna cry now
Omg, so many memories in just one video 😍
Hey so can Mitch sing Lovely by Billie Eilish and Khalid. Thank you - everyone
So proud growing up on that decade
90s Anthem for real!
paaarty time XD
Love, love, love!!!
Yessssss
Smashing!!! The past meets present days.... I wouldn't mind more 90's tunes in single!! Happiness..!! 💪  Ps: Mitch, that moustache is terrible 😂😂😂
My god in heaven I'm going to have an outbreak 😍
Best one I’ve hear in a long time !! I love it !!
Omg. The Best video ever. Where are the 90 Kids?? 😁🎉🍾❤
amazing i love all this songs pentatonix are the best
Can you just sing “cher believe” you guys did a unbelievable version
2 of these songs are from 2000 and ones from 2005.... also, I miss when it was 100% acapella now there's so much editing 😩 especially with kirstin and mitch. Because now their egos are so big and it's not about the music. I miss the old YouTube video days
Make full Versions of the classic Tracks. This would be Awesome!
Incroyable et Exceptionnel Medley ! Bravo à tous et Merci ;)
Theres songs from 00 though ;)
Супер!!!
Rewel, beautiful 😍😍😘😘😘😘
Now I want a Eurodance medley
Pleas make a album with the 90ts 😍
Right when I seen it was 90s I was hopping Boom Boom Boom would be on here and THANK YOU. Iv always wanted to hear you guys do a full cover!
So apparently there are a lot of 90's tracks that I don't like and blocked out.
All time favorite! Go Penta! Gooooooo! 🏆😍
Siete fantastici
Really love this! ❤️🎶
Anytime Matt sings it's magical. I am disappointed with how autotuned their voices are... Which I get... It's 90s dance music, but still, their voices are amazing without autotune and autotune is not necessary when you're as talented as Pentatonix
Omg this is too Good. 😍
Am I the only one who was hoping to hear Macarena? ^_^
Congratulations Kevin on your Baby!!!🥳🥰
Really nice!! BUT where's Barbie girl from AQUA and Dancehall Queen from Beenie Man??!! We need a part 2! Lol
I do love their covers song than the original song
giséstlersson
Woah! This is a bop!!!
I love how Matt smiles while singing
This is really awesome clip, I wish to meet U soo much after all this pandemi on your concert. I love U all! U was awesome in Pitch Perfect 2
Cinta satu malam 🤣
Always impressive 🥰 I wanna see y'all in concert again so bad! Last time in huntsville, alabama was phenomenal!
necesitaba este video y no lo sabia
Me encantó su versión de "Its feels so good " Fantástico !!! Ritmo pegajoso
Wow this made me smile and lowkey needed that. ❤️
Me in my car singing cause people think I’m weird
Nice!👍💜
yesssssssssssss!!!! You put me back in a DISCO when I was teenegaer !!! Love you guys!!!!!
I just landed back in high school. Except the music is cooler. :)
Pisnicky
2:15 what song is this?
They using some mix of auto tune..it has been edited not pure live acapella
Fcuk am i considered OLD if i knew all of these tracks 🙈
WAIT A MINUTE. WHO ARE THE ONES WHO DISLIKE THIS? THIS VIDEO AND EVERYTHING THAT MAKES THE VIDEO IS AMAZING 🙏🏻
Amazing as always <3
this reminds me of Weird Al's polkas but you know, with more of a beat to it, still awesome!
This feels like Non Stop Pop from GTA V condensed into 5 minutes.
Thx for this great Medley! 90 and 00er! It remember me on my schooltime!
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it was brilliant!!!!!
There's no way! These guys have a harmony never seen before.👏
Hi can we please get an album where these are all full covers pls and thankies love y’all
This is a masterpiece! You never fail to amaze me!
Muchos empezamos a seguir a PENTATONIX por cosas como estas. Obra maestra, gracias.
Fantastic!!!
I DEMAND the full version of " Better Off Alone"!!!!!!!!

Hello from France !! Amazing ! It's really a fire video ! Interpretation, lights, energie ! Thank you for this moment ! Choice of music, dynamic montage, good style, all is very very cool. Bravo to the team and realization ! Boost for the day ! Take care.

thats what i love to see!!!🔥😍🔥😍
PETITION FOR A BROADWAY MEDLEY
Let's dance🥰❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Great music as usual
MORE PLEASE
How did this even surpass my expectations when I was already expecting greatness? The talent always astounds me 😍  Other than the fact that Waiting For Tonight was a ‘97 track by Third Party and only remixed by J.Lo ‘99 - I have no complaints.
Uwielbiam Was! Geniusz + talent = uczta dla uszu. Pozdrawiam serdecznie z Polski.
Damn, the amount of changes that has happened since the Evolution of Music video 7 years ago...
My god these people are beautiful! 🥰
🤟🏻❤👍🏻
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This. Is. I N S A N E. WOOOWWWOWOWOWOOWO
This was EPIC!!!! Such nostalgia for my university years when all these songs were club staples! Now we need an 80s medley!!!! 😬 I’m thinking aha’s Take On Me, Toto’s Africa, Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams, Madonna’s Holiday....
Son los mejores!
This is absolutely amazing!!! I recognize all of these songs from my childhood years!  Can you please add this to spotify or one of your albums?
Someone's missing The Rhthm of the Night?
Omg these are the "songs that get Europeans turnt". I'm in looove!

I would love to see them do this but the 80's! 😍
The only bad in this video is the end 😞 (i’m uruguayan, sorry for my english)
Pls make a full Version of "Eveytime we Touch"
Never thought I'd say Pentatonix could hang at gbb! If this could be a live stage performance! ESH!
I hope they will make a full version of Believe
ALL. THE. NOSTALGIA
LOOOOOVE LOVE LOVE the “Do you think you’re better off alone” part (as well as the entire mashup) amazing work guys!!!!! 😍
Yes, ready for that nostalgia
YESSSSS my god guys totally absolutely amazingly epic ❤️❤️
Kirstie does a fabulous job of reminding me I'm gay haha
Pentatonix nunca decepciona
Missed The Rhythm of the Night
Why do their outfits keep changing?
Such talent is just amazing!!
They should make a synder version and cover 20 minutes of 90s songs
im using it now in my Computer, ASUS AURA SYNC, MUSIC MODE, its COOL!! :-D
I think I repeatedly shook my head in awe during this entire video. I'm an 80's baby so I grew up listening to these tracks in the 90's. This was so nostalgic and I LOVE it!! I need full versions of all of them!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How amazing is this!!!!!
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay <3
omg I'm living for this! <3
THE VIBES. OOOOOH~ !  I'M LITERALLY DANCIN'.  MORE POWER TO Y'ALL PENTATONIX !  LOVE LOTS FROM PHILIPPINES. 💙💙💙💙
90's dance Medley without "L'amour toujours"......not a great work. I'm just kidding you're great even you made this big mistake
Your Gods!!!!
That cascade! I for a sec thought that was the original singer! So similar!
Pretty cool!
This unlocked memories I had of my very first techno burned cd given to me by my older sister’s friends
😍😍😍
I just noticed that their outfits change.
EVERYBODY DANCE NOW
I did not want this to end.
I need this every morning as my alarm start off with a mini dance party every day
What happened to the other guy?
In sounds like on some places they used Auto-tune. Why would they do that? Listen at the Cher song. It sounds pretty strong there.
80's disco please :*
I love it 😍
Ganda naman
More medley guys..good job
PLEASE DO A COVER OF DYNAMITE BY BTS!!! LIKE IF YOU ARE AGREE, SO THEY CAN READ THIS COMMENT!!!!!!!
BLOODY AWESOME!
Y’all This is incroyable 😍
I cant stop moving my head while listening that
Music of my uni's time. Thanks, PTX!
im not into pentatonix anymore,,, sorry but,,, where is that "bass" guy???
As a 90's teenager (I turned 13 in 1990) this is the soundtrack of my high school and undergrad college years! This is UTTERLY FABULOUS!! Every single song included on here I  have on either cassette tape, CD or both!! In fact, I just put Sonique's 'Feel's so good' on my spotify workout playlist. I agree with all the comments all stating there should be full recordings of all these songs!! Fantastic selection and uncompromising vocals we have all come to love!
OMG Kirstin🙌❤️❤️❤️
Boom Boom Boom
This consumes my brain 24 hours a day  And I love it
this is fucking gooood
i litteraly forget everytime that their are singing in accapella
anyone else notice they had a background outfit, and an outfit for when they took the lead?
Eyyyyyyy! I'm livin!
Put all of your covers on Spotify or apple music please!!! love you guys so much <3
Sou brasileiro mais amo essas músicas
You know when people say oh it's a 90s night but it's all early 2000s......this blew that right off the wall haha. So so 90s. I feel my age... loved all these songs growing up!
the best songs and singers😅🥰
All are wonderful, as usual... Scott, Mitch, Kirstin and Kevin, perfect... but I want to highlight Matt's work... it's so difficult to fill Ari's place, and he does it so well!!! Congrats all from Barcelona, we're all wishing you could come soon to see you alive.... I sing in two choirs, and we are all your fans!!!
Loved it!
Gua kira cinta satu malam
I need a full version of every time we touch and I’m blue
j'aime trop
Only found out a few days ago about Pentatonix (live in a hole It seems!) listened to most vids the past few days on PC speakers....blown away by the harmonies. And yes I have had the "Mitch Face" more than once. But stick a good pair of earphones on for the true experience...sat sobbing at Hallelujah, grown man....deary me!
Some of the songs here are from the mid-2000s, so the name of this video should have reflected it
THE NOSTALGIA HITS HARD
This was absolutely GREAT! Thank you beautiful people.
omg I love it <3
Where's the long haired guy before..?
adottatemi. grazie.
I love this but where is Britney?????
Encore encore encore!!!! haha :o Whoa!
I'm mad youtube didn't properly recommend this to me. I had to stumble onto it. Come on, youtube! I dinged that bell for a reason!
Cascada : Every Time we Touch Released : 2006 😂
1:38
Ima need a full version of “Believe by Cher” BECAUSE THE BUILDUP MADE ME TOO HYPE
Goosebumps
2:52
So cool ist is to nice
This is soooo good!
Wunderschön
Wow🥰🙏Thank you
Please make a full version of every song!!!!
I am an elder millennial and this is what I needed today.
I want this on spotify-
0:56 WTF!? WHO IS SINGING THAT SYNTH BEHIND MITCH? Are those Kirstin's Legendary Whistle notes!?
This gave me serious flasbacks.
Damm! Been on replay like 10 times. Well done guys!
More medley Please! So much memories as a 90’s
The only thing that bumbs me out, is that those have no full versions! It got me so in a groove!! PTX, I’ve got a marketing tip for you guys... make a ‘90’s album. Crouwd will go nuts for it!!
Be my Lover (1994) What is Love (1993) All around the world (1999) Better off alone (1999) Gonna make you sweat (1990) Rhythm is a Dancer (1992) Boom Boom I want you in my room (1999) It feel so good (1998) Everytime we touch (1992) - but version used here is by Cascada (2005) Blue (1998) Deep Inside (1993) Show me love (1993) Waiting for tonight (1999) Beautiful Life (1996) Believe (1998) Gypsy woman (1991) Finally (1991)
This is the best medley EVER.
0:54 this is smooth!
I think this is my 1,000,000,000th play through?
The first two songs reminds me of night at the roxbury
So Absolutely Talented
Excellent, so many memories.
Please do a 90s pop medley.
Классссс!!!! Слушал бы ребят вечно. Вы огромные молодцы!!!
PTX you guys please sing the UEFA Champions League anthem please🙏 I beg you guys please. It will be a masterpiece 🙏
as someone born at the tail of the decade, I can only recognize these as songs from the toys from restaurants or gift shops
Impresionante muchachos saludos desde argentina 💪👏😘😍😍😍😍😘
Around the world (la la la la la) and Everytime we touch are from the 2000s.
I’m gonna need a full Believe cover ASAP! This is amazing, well done guys!
Отлично
LOVEIT!😍💯
I like that they kept the signature autotune in Cher's Believe even though their voices has no need of it.
Everytime we touch full version pls 😊
From a person that grew up in the 90s, you guys picked great songs, so much nostalgia!!! Thxs PTX
I’ll need a full version of every tie we touch please!!
Can we just take a moment and adore how they look in blue light when singing blue 🤣
0:37
I didn’t know I needed this in my life😭
😍😍😍👍👍👍💜💜💜😘😘😘😝🎆🎆
that was awesome!!!!
This would be awesome as a full album that I'd definitely listen to. Continue making great music
Demais muto bom :-)
I love the beauty of the crisp look but i don't care for the digital enhancement  You don't need any artificial help.  But you are all amazing always and forever and Ive been  a true fan from the "Evolution of music" ....I'm yours from the beginning. ❤️ Stay true to yourselves.
I NEED A FULL LENGTH VERSION OF EVERY SINGLE SONG *PLEASE*
AMAZIIIING. Thank Penta. Ur da best!!. Love you.
That Cascada hit harder than expected...
I will always be mesmerized by Mitch's voice.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
everyone remember back in like the early early days of youtube when every other AMV was Every time we Touch?
My God, is there ANY look that Miss Kirsten couldn't pull off and look so beautiful! Heck, all the guys are always styling and look good as well. What a great talented group!
I absolutely love this!!!
Okay obviously Pentatonix is flawless, but I want to take a second and throw some love at the editor because 5:03 shook me for a second. That was awesome. Great video all around.
It's the Crystal Waters and Cece Penniston at the end for me😩😩😩💓
Wow so good
Damn. This brought me back and wow is their talent level insane.
Can we get a Queen Mariah medley or something?!?!
What's wrong with the people disliking this video?
Jesus loves you; he died on the cross for you. The gospel is about God's GRACE to eternal life. Salvation is a free gift, there are no strings attached.  Your sins are purged by the blood of Jesus alone. I dare you to believe.
This is a master piece! A FULL ALBUM OF THESE SONGS WOULD BE EPIC. I would buy it in a heart beat!
I adore all of them and stan them all so much. I wish I had half as cool of a sense of style as Mitch or Matt here like wow. And Scott's glasses too are right up my alley. Also it was nice to know so many of these songs in a compilation for once. I was singing right along, it's so good! <3 Such an amazing cover
✨P E R F E C T I O N✨
Que le están pasando a sus labios??? :( Me parecía más bonita sin eso...
Late comment but 17nsongs in 5 minutes this is the thing their good at that they can blend many songs in few minutes song for new here this is the best acapella band if your looking for
You should make this medley into an album of the full version of each song.
This petition better be real though. If not Id be very disappointed.
The power to lift the spirits!  Thanks so much.
I wonder why 2:14 feels familiar to me then I realized oh so "cinta 1 malam" was plagiarized over this song huh
Minha infância resumida em 5 minutos
Where do I download this song?!?!?
Omg the Sonique part! Brilliant!
Glad to hear Sonique  “Feels So Good” made the cut!
THEY SANG MEME SONGS LOL
Speechless. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I grew up with all this songs love them I sang the whole time
Please release full covers of these! Especially Believe!!
..Seriously need a 90s Eurodance verse now.. XDD
Cant. Stop. Listening. Omg. So. Freaking. Good.
More. Of. This!!!!!
W. O. W.
LOVE THIS,,!!,
SPOTIFY DUDEEEEEEEEEEEE
I didn't know they had a woman who dressed like a man in the group. You do drag really well.
I love you guys to death, but you have let your traditions slip quite a bit.i still like the medley, but it's not as good as I know it could have been.
Dude this song is 🔥🔥🔥
90s had too much songs that don't even have lyrics
I recognized ALL of these songs. Does that make me basic or just old???
Is it weird  I still jam to theses g's majority  of them are on my housework playlist on Spotify
I only have one complaint... WHERE WAS “RHYTHM OF THE NIGHT” by CORONA?!
This is major throwback! That got me movin and a shakin💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾 As a 90s baby I am pleased 😌
I love you Pentatonix 😍😍 from the Philippines
THIS IS SO GOOD!!
IT WOULD BE SO UNFAIR TO HAVE PENTATONIX NOT TO DO THE FULL VERSIONS OF ALL THESE SONGS
Amazing so good
Guys, they’re amazing 😍
They cheated a lot for this one... But that was amazing anyway
Where's the success ones of nowadays
God my aunt was such a 90's music fan. I was born way later but I recognize every single one of those bc of her!!
OMGOSHHHH HOW FAR THEY’VE COME!
This just unlocked so many memories
I feel bad for them. They knew these songs. I partied to them in clubs and bars.
KO is a robot. I am convinced now. These songs needed multiple machines to make those noises.
I Know there is a point for all that EQ and autotune, after all those are 90s songs...  but I would love to hear their arrangements without all of that...
Amazing!!!!
I definitely didn't realize how much 90s and 70s music had in common until this video.
1:13 favorite part OMG that bass 😯
Pq trocaram o baixista #ninguémécomoele
Is it just me or do you love that they added the boom boom boom song
I love this insane medley, well done to all of you guys! Just one thing to correct you: "Everytime We Touch" by Cascade is a 2005/2006 released song! This means it's not from the 90's, although it's a very good song! In any case, good job with this new video, keep making great songs/medleys in the future! Love from The Netherlands!
eargasm  ❤❤❤
Idd love to hear these guys do a cover of Matt corbys Brother I think they would nail it
That was insane! So many great songs in such a nice medley!
All sounds and voices vibrate every corner of my body and are full of joy.  Mitch's voice can only be heard as a mechanical sound!  I love!💕💕😍💕💕
I know and remember all of these songs. The 90s were magical.
Cinta satu malam, oh indahnya
OMG!!!!! AWESOME! Youtube didn't send the notification but I'm freaking out with every beat 😍🤩 amazing!!!! My teens all over again 🥰
why am i waiting to get rickrolled
Love the jlo and Cher part. Iconic songs! You guys are so talented.
We need a full version of 2:14😍😍
The 90s were one  the best time of music...
OMGGGGGGG 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
vocês são incríveis! tem muito talento
I don’t know why but something was missing for me in this one. It felt a little over produced and maybe not as genuine as their usual? I’m having a hard time articulating it, but it just didn’t hit me as hard as their stuff usually does
615 people leading a sad, miserable life. Hopefully PTX will help them find the way.
It is James Corden?
I have watched this like 100 times and I’m still amazed! They are so talented!
And still I miss Avi for some impressive bass notes.
Beeeeeesssssstttttt compilation EVER!!!!!
Bruh... 1:53 on repeat. I need a full version.
Que demais.
Dang you killed it guys. ❤️🥵
The 90's are such an under-appreciated decade for music. This hit me in the nostalgia in such a good way ❤️
well... this is an album I'd buy in a heartbeat
The beat+tone+sound+remix+voice= pentatonix  -it's like an addiction of music...
Absolutely captivating. I couldn't look away! What a special treat for your ears!! LOVE PTX!
Please put this on Spotify!! 😍😍
I don't want to be that person because I LOVE this but some of these aren't 90s songs, they're noughties (2000-2010). Everytime We Touch is 2006! Idk, still gave me major nostalgia and had me making a new spotify playlist for club classics, but it did confuse me initially
Full version of Cher's Believe please! Pretty please!
Ah, Medleys. My all time favorite Pentatonix music.
pqperfeito
The soundtrack of my formative years.  Excuse me while I listen to only this medley for the rest of the month.
Perfect!!!! I love 90's songs
Can y’all please make an album of 90s songs!?
What a joy to lissten ♡♡♡♡
Loooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍
So Eurodance Medley...
Im in love with Matt and Scott 😍😍😍😍😍
banger!
Ol boys vocals are killing it
Yaaazazel 777 Thankeesai MiRoRa Yes to this
😍😍😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤💖💖💖
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
y'all are always a big source happiness
MY EARS ARE BLESSED 😭😭😭😭
Im an 07 kid but i litterally grew up with all these songs lmao purely just because of my mum playing them all the time in the car
Amazing job!!!
Mitch is the MVP here
Pentatonix,  I love you guys so much, but enough with the auto tune. Your voices are already so naturally beautiful, and that’s what makes you guys so unique. Auto tunes like 4:16 and 4:35 are obviously amazing, but unnecessary and over-the-top for what you guys are built on.  Much love,  Judah
SHE'S HOMELESS
Bacana a homenagem, mas tem que fazer a parte 2 porquê faltaram muitos ícones da época.... Alexia&IceMc Double You Technotronic  Faz aí PTX 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Man, now I need a full version for Everytime we Touch.
0:52 Mitch nailed that classic.
Just awe-struck throughout the whole video
I love these mashups. The songs go so well together!
I I need full versions PLEASE
wow!! all the nostalgia
I was born after 90's, but I remember almost all of this songs, it remind me my childhood 😍 Thank you for this video 🙏
Porqué tan pocos likes?? Esto se merece 1M de likeees😍😍😍😍😍
They should record this melody mix as a single recording❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Another masterpiece! ❤️ it! 😍👍
i have a crush on scotts hair :/
Basically my whole childhood in one song...I was 6 in 1990 and 15 in 1999:)
so it's been a while since I listened to you guys. kind of did a little ptx strike when avi left here's my thoughts.   mitch I'm not a fan of the mustach but the hair looks good kirst you are 1 powerful woman Scott loving your current style kevin.... I follow you on tic toc. we need more of the cello. Matt. you sound good. would like to see you take the lead in some parts.  also can we have some old school sat on the couch no extra production pure acapella videos like in the beginning.  those had so much soul and heart in them. this felt similar to the daft pink video. which was amazing but they were the special not the regular.   please bring back the old couch
BRAWO
This appears to be the music Gen X and Gen Y (Millenials) grew up with. Apparently they liked it. Apparently it shaped their taste in music. Here's the question: If you like THIS, how do you dare to make fun of the "boomers"?
This is my childhood... in acapella.
God I feel old... I remember these coming out
Обожаю
What a fabulous group of people!
0:36 vine vibes AHAJAHAHAH
It's like a Night at the Roxbury remix, lol.
Heyyy its wonderfullllll😍
Y'all are killin' it!  Love all of you!!!  So talented!  Your music and talent make my days happier.  Had a rough day?  Jam to some Pentatonix and you can't help but feel better!  You all are better than a Zoloft!  Thank you all for doing what you do so that we can all enjoy it!
90's baby 😍😍😍 I love that so much
Please Release a acoustic Version!
Amazing as always Pentatonix!!! This has given us so much inspiration for our next a Cappella cover!!! 😍
Such a bop! Loved this!
Excellent !!! 💥💛💥 !!!
Now this is a 90's vibe
How many times am I going to  re-watch this...  "The limit does not exist"
Mitch's part in what is love... Ugh, i can't take it, his voice is beyond perfect 😍
One of the best medley eveeer , just love it
Ну вот, годнота подъехала.
I kind of do not get the use of autotune in this song. I thought I'd never see PTX use autotune
Luv it....is this a preview to a 90s album coming?  I'm a huge fan and very interested.  Awesome job!
ТОЛЬКО ВЧЕРА услышал этот трек, а сегодня уже тащусь от него, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/T9KqeNyli9o
Welp, this is a hard flashback to my teen years xD
Love from Nigeria ❤️❤️
I require full versions of each song please! 😍😍😍
0:38 — Originally was a russian song
Mind blown. Every time.
Wow, she did Cascada amazingly well.
I'm about to cry at how good this is!!!
Need me more Venga-tonix.
Awesome
😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏
👍👍👍👍👍
I can appreciate the visual cue for Daba Di
Damn all these vibes in a single Master piece 😍
Каждое ваше видео - это маленький концерт! Не перестаю удивляться граням вашего таланта! Какие же вы обалденные! 👍🔥
AMAZING! You guys never cease to bring a smile. I love your music, your talents are INCREDIBLE!!!
Amazing 😍
1,2m views. 0,6 was mine for sure
Amazing
petition for Mitch to star as Cher in a biopic
It's amazing. 🤩🤩
Scott was totally feeling himself in that yellow suit 😂😂 like that was a whole vibe
Awesomeeeeeeee
I’ve been in love with you guys since I was 7, I’m 17 now!😭you guys never fail no impress and inspire me.
Am I the only one who is really disappointed with this medley? Not the choice of songs, they are okay but the execution? You can clearly hear that every single voice has been remastered over and over again... It's absolutely okay, but it has nothing to do with acapella whatsoever....
I love it! Nostalgic for us 90s kids!
hello, major bruising all over her arms, definitely looked like finger prints as outside arm had multiple and inside arm had one big one like a thumb....either an SRI or something more concerning.
I feel so proud of them since I remember seeing them for the first time on sing off when it first premiered and saying from day one they are winning this.  I can't believe they have 19 million subscribers and this video has only been up for 4 days and they have 1.3 million views. Congrats PTX! Keep goin you are a world wide phenomenon.
amazing as always
Nostalgia
Awesome medley... where can I buy/download it?
Can you guys make Every time we touch FULL cover PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Full version of Blue please!
Loved Scott’s sunglasses so mutch, I had to buy me a pair immediatly. 🙈🙈
mbabe really can do anything
Strong like always. But I feel sorry to say that for me some parts sound like that computer helped with beat. That's a little bit away from what is Pentatonix for me...
Вы Крутые!!!! Ваша фанатка из России!  Oldскулы сводит 😘
Okay after hearing them do so many classics. I really wanna hear pentatonix do We like to party- vega boyz. I need that in my life 😂😂
I swear, they need to do a song where Mitch leads not in falsetto but in his chest voice. Voice of an angel.
Love😍🥺😰❤️❤️❤️
After they changed cher - believe to video killed the radio star in the sing off, I always wondered when they're going to actually sing that song... After 10 years, finally
HOW was this up for 4 WHOLE DAYS before youtube decided to tell me about it?!
I love it!
feel like you never do anything better then daft punk cover
YES
Love it!! (as always). Is it possible to do a Disney Medley?
Love, Love, Love it!!!!!
That... Was... AMAZING! 🤘🤩🤘  I want Matt' black & blue jacket. Sweet! 🥰
Beautiful life, yeah!! ❤️ Whole version of that, pleaseeee!
wow!!!
I was extremely happy this came out on my birthday. Amazing throwback guys! <3
NO THE SIGN OR BARBIE GIRL????
A couple of these songs are from the 00's... But still an awesome medley!
it´s amazing
The transition!! Damn! Smooth as butter.
The start of "better off alone" literally gave me chills XD <3
So goood
I love the Freddie vibes from Mitch ❤️
omg I want all these songs singularly !!! haha sing - gularly... O_O
I hope one day these guys get together with  and do a song with Angelina Jordan! Her acapella is crazy good! Well, her everything she does is crazy good, just like Pentatonix.
THIS IS AMAZING!! BRAVO!! 😍😍😍
upload spotify plz 🤩🤩🤩 keep repeating
아 펜타토닉스 진짜 사랑합니다...💕 i love you!!!!!
This was good, cascada was 2000s though.
Please 90 s Album ;-)
Супер
I love absolutely everything about this
I was born in '94 and I'm honestly shocked about how I recognize almost every single one of these considering how few things I remember from being a young child. I guess they were still pretty popular in the 2000s.
We don't need instruments anymore 😌❤️
Medleys I want to see Pentanonix do: Evolution of Disney  Girl bands and Boybands medley  Eurovision songs medley  Madonna medley  Tv theme medley  Prince Medley Evolution of Musicals/Broadway
okay but Kirstie's voice 😩
Impecable.
Eartly 2000's AMV music compilation
Okay. Now I need full version of Sonique... this or sky... please... pretty please?? :D
AH LAB ET 😆
You guys are Amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
ペンタの動画流しながら片付けようと思ったのに、だめだこりゃ、引き込まれてまう😶
no one is gonna talk about Matt's singing?!?!?! Absolutely breathtaking
YEAH YEAH YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING OH MY GOD
Each individual song was amazing, as always you are an amazing example of how your voice is all you need to make amazing music! However, the transition between each individual song varied from fantastic to just plain terrible... which was disappointing. You guys have always done amazing transitions between songs but this felt... forced. Big Sad :( Still very good though, deserves a like for the individual songs sounding good :)
Waiting for 00's
What happened to her lips
I wish they added in Another Night by Real McCoy
Why is Everytime We Touch in this medley? It came out in 2006, not the 90s.
by Gaia you are all amazing this was sooooooooo good to listen to.
one of my fav videos of yours of ALL TIME!!!
Their editor is so good.
Brilliant!
Awesom greetings from Poland
Wonderful
All of these hits in their entire versions would be great! Thanks Pentatonix!
These were the parts I have downloaded when I had a 56k modem and Napster.
Kirstin is so pretty!
This is my jam. Cascada. Chills.
this should me their next album.
Kirstin ! <3
👏👏🔥🔥🔥
I was just waiting for gypsy woman
Everytime We Touch - Cascada is from 2005
Please do the complete version.
PERFECT .I HAVEN'T GOT ANY WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT. IT'S PEERFEEEEEEEEECT! PENTATONIX,I LOVE YOU!!!
Also, is there a sixth Pentatonix member? The editor
Damn, this is hot!!
I could listen to the whole Cascada song! Please could you guys do the whole thing?
Here for my love of their music...and my obsession of the evolution of Mitch’s hairstyles lol
4.02 Cher Believe 👑
4:03 yasss Matt represent the bass’ high notes😂😂😅
Soooo Good!
Cascada <3
Great but Atc is not 90s
Omg this made my day <3
Só eu fiquei esperando o Barbie girl? Adorei!!!!
A tribute to 90s dance without the hits of Corona, GALA and a whole series of epic eurodance songs in my opinion is worth nothing, sorry guys I hope you do better next time ...
THIS IS SO GOOD!
so this must be the teaser! *WAITING FOR THE FULL VERSIONS*
sooooo good
yes
Incredable!
I NEED A FULL VERSION OF EVERYTIME WE TOUCH THAT WAS AMAZING OMGGG!!!!
Mitch is the most annoying person ever. Seriously.
THE BEST GROUP
I love Cascada
THANK YOUUUUUUU
omg, the "everything we touch" version it´s asomeeeeeee.
I legit bought a TOP 10 DANCE HITS Cd from Walmart back in 2006. That CD contained 80% of the songs here in it and that kept me from going insane from the LA Morning traffic when I was working there from 06 to 08. I since lost that CD.... Thanks YouTube.
Please do Arcade by Duncan Laurence ❤️❤️
These songs are on a different level! Thank you for this! Fantastic job!
I was really hoping for some type of flow from song to song but instead it was really choppy and disjointed, especially in the beginning
This medley has boosted my serotonin levels to the max! My only request is that they fit in Barbie Girl by Aqua, a gay awakening for any 90s gayby 🏳️‍🌈❤️
So cool, takes me back to my early teens :) Now I kinda want to hear Van Canto doing the same with 90s rock!
1:53 I've got goosebumps all over my body! And this whole thimg is a masterpiece! So amazing guys ✨
Gorgeous playlist, mash up and performance, as always, guys !!! 😍 Genius !!! 🤩 Congrats !!! 👏👏👏  Greetings from România !!! 😍😘 Big fan!!! 🤗☺
This is lamentably good soo good gosh 🥵
BOOM BOOM and the glasses lift OMG love this
This is brilliant, and love it, but also, please gimme full versions of every single one of these songs? Yes? *grabby hands*
💗💗💗
Okay if y'all can do that for the 90's y'all need to bring the funk and the 80's.That was really great..
Waiting for tonight love it
Create an album for these? :)
Love such mixed songs! :)
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
This is SOOOOOOO AMAZING <3
You guys should do a full cover of Blue!!!! I'd be forever grateful!!
Everyone else: 90s Dance Medley? Woah this is gonna be good.  Me: Sike I do dance medleys in my shower every day.   (But fr, they are brilliant‼️)
THIS IS FLAWLESS!!!!
Perfect starter song choice 😍
Meanwhile Maytree makes a 1min clip of iPhone system sounds and get over 10M views.... fascinating how our world works.... :)
listening to this makes me wish I was born in the 90s instead of the early 2000s. Also can we talk about Kirstin's hair cuz OMG it is soooo cute!
Wooooooow
AMAIZING
Can we have full covers of all these songs? Pretty pleeeease
Evolution of BTS PLEASE
Evolution of BTS PLEASE
I love this ❤️❤️❤️
Hope they can do a full cover of Cher's - Believe
Pentatonix!!!! My fave acapella group!! Love you guys from here.. Phillipines😊
Pentatonix!!!! My fave acapella group!! Love you guys from here.. Phillipines😊
This was my favorite Torrent. Please complete the full songs thanks :)
justtt wowwwwww
so cool🥺🥺
Believe by Cher was my favorite part! Got literal goosebumps when Matt started to sing :)
Before every new video Mitch asks himself "How can I make myself look more ridiculous than I did in the last video?" and somehow he pulls it off every time.
ugh its sooooo eargasm
This od super, you are cool <3
YAAAS
It's 8 AM here and u already make me dance and cry, thanks : )
Everyone was legit serving!
T. A. L. E. N. T Definition of singing talent : PENTATONIX
Imagining myself dancing with these tracks on the dance dance revo machine.. 🥰🥰 90's
So many great tunes!
Faltou cantar uma música do Latino... Oh Baby me leva...
You're missing Prodigy - Firestarter, Ultra Nate - Free, Chemical Bros - Hey boy Hey Girl, Fatboy Slim - Praise you, modjo-lady, artful dodger- Rewind, Groovejet - Spiller, Faithless - Insomnia, Scatman John - I'm A Scatman, Robert Miles - Children, Underworld - Born Slippy (nuxx), Leftfield - Phat Planet, Paradisio - Bailando  With that said, part 2 is requested!!
This gives such a nostalgic vibe. 90's - is still the decade with THE best dance numbers ☺ This is such a good medley, all the good ones and as always perfectly performed and sound.
I really need a full version of blue
Wow.. more than 1M viewers in 3 days!!!
THE BEST ONE YET, BY FAR!!!
💥💥💥🙏🏻💕 brilliant!
I like them when they are natural cause they are GOOD!. This is too auto-tuned / digitally edited. Not a fan of this..
Más temas como éstos viejitos reversionados, porfis!💕🙏
So freakin’ TOTALLY Amazing!!!
need full version of Boom Boom Boom Boom, Everytime We Touch and Blue!!!
I love yours ❤❤❤❤
I’m pretty sure a couple of these are not from the 90’s. They should have added “no limit”
scott's hair is everything
Sonique😍😍😍 It's perfect
What happened to the other bass guy?
I need this on streaming platform ASAP!!!!!
These songs are now considered as classics and I feel so old.
This is one of my favorite videos theyve done
This was something that I didn’t know I needed,  but I definitely did.
Now the girl seems like Anitta
❤️💕❤️💕
nice
Wow! They've come so far ever since they got vocal training from Miranda Sings. I'm in awe.
Finalmente Kirstin canta nel suo registro naturale! Clamorosa!
Roxette, pet shop boys, ace of base...
What about an 80's version?😏
I don’t know what to think about kirstins new hand thing, it’s cool how they evolve over time
what is that dress call that kirstin is wearing
Mitch:*breathes* Me: *hits the like button*
The dance version of Everytime We Touch is from 2006. The original from '92 was not a dance song.

Petition for pentatonix to make a full version of everytime we touch

Amazing.... 🎬🎥📡🎛🎚🎚🎚🎚🎚🎚🎚🎚🎛🎤♩🎼🕪🎵🎶🎵🎛🎚🎚🎚🎚🎛🤔🙃😁
Can we find this video/song on Spotify????
Listening to the full cover of "What is Love" made by Pentatonix would be awesome! Hope we'll have the chance in the future.  Edit: After watching the full video, I think I want the full covers of all of the songs LOL!
These guys are just ...fire ...or wat??
Wow your are so amazing😮😮❤️
I'm going to have to start just listening to this amazing group without watching the videos from now on.  Mitch's mullet and goofy mustache are apparently not a phase... and I just can't take it anymore.
Boom boom boom boom! Pentatonix in my room! 💕
i miss them TT
OMG I LOVE IT ❤️
The arranggements are FIRE! 🔥🔥🔥 As well as the artistes as always !!!  STAY SAFE EVERBODY ;)

That was amazing guys. Brings back good memories for me please do a full video for all songs on this Playlist.
Was anyone else reminded of Olivia Newton-John at the end of Grease by Kirsty's leather-jacket-and-gold-hoops look or is it just me?
a serve
https://youtu.be/lExW80sXsHs
Amazing as usual! Now, I need a full Alanis Morissette mash up.
This medley SLAPS!!!!
This should have been a lot longer...like a full hour! 🥰😎🤩🥳
Is this going to be on Spotify? Cause I need it!
2:14 cinta satu malam oh indahnya cinta satu malam buat ku melayang~
Why are there so many moments where the video does not match with the song at all. Like there are times they look like they are singing a completely different song.
Is nobody going to talk about how Mitch slayed it on the better of alone and everybody dance now parts
Alternative title: 2021 Meme Music Compilation
Please do a 80s rock 2000s rap medley.
😍🤩✨🥺❤️
This is next level stuff 🙌🔥
Wow.wow.wowwwwww

I don't know what the other thinks about this mv's background but it does remind me of the vibe of a lot of the old mvs, including Daft Punk...etc ....and I absolutely love it!

for my birthday !! thx pentatonix !!!
Kinda miss Avi but you sound so great with Matt! You gave me chills from the hell. I love it!
I only know these because of the grocery store I work at play list
❤️
Cudowni uwielbiam ich
I love this so much, but didn't Everytime We Touch come out in 2006.
Cascada was 2006. In my opinion, that's not 90s dance ;)
❤❤❤
Старые PENTATONIX вернулись!
I love this!!  One thing though, they list "Everytime we Touch" by Cascada which was released in 2005/6. The original was '92. They should have listed Maggie Reilly.
We could all use some PTX now and then just sayin lol
Why does Kirsten look.... so ethereal
I was born in 1979. The 90s were the best time of my life. Is it strange that I like to have full versions of that? Thank you for the flashbacks
BRB reliving my past listening to all these songs again
medley AF. WHY NOT KEEP THE KEY CHANGES DIATONIC/CHROMATIC instead of direct key changes???? connect all the keys and everyone will lose their mind. Love you guys. sorry if this felt like a rip, it isn't. keep killing it!!!
Yay my teenager me back than is so hooked up 💯💯💯💯💕
👍🤟👌
mariah medley whitney medley and celine medley. lastly the vocal trinity medley
The fact that I don't know a single song makes me feel that I'm very uncultured 😂
SUPERB.
The things you can do with five voices amazes me.
I would die for a full version of Every Time We Touch omg
so fkn good!!!
Obsessed!!!!
This is so good! Takes me back to the OG PTX days! Omg I’m in love 🥰
This is basically just the night at the Roxbury soundtrack lol.
So beautiful 😭💜
Kirstie looks like Whitney Houston 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️And...MIIIIIIITCH!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍
Mandou aquele teclado lindinho que arrepiou até a alma
I love this! Super nostalgic!   I can’t be the only one that would like to see/ hear an 80s version. Maybe with New Jack Swing and/or Freestyle classics! 🙏🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽
Guyd guys guys please do separate covers for these songs. Unbearable only few lines for each song 😭😭😭😭 please
I tried buying this medley on iTunes unfortunately it isn't available yet.
Chillllllllzzzzzzzzz
This just cured my loneliness.
So many talents together.....amazing
Got chills on Cher
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Luv u all.
EYYY
STUDIO3121...Still begging PTX for some original material and a new Producer with some new vision.  I'm guessing that is not gonna happen EVER!
Wonderfullll!!!!!!
HAPPY ONE MILLION VIEWS!!!!
Kirstin feeling those curls. Literally and metaphorically.
Lots of good nostalgia from a better time. Also Kristy rocking that silver dress, looked amazing in it.
This is what I’ve been WAITING FOR
We Need Second Part
I just love it when you guys do medleys
Amazing
Personaly I miss Barbie girl by aqua in selection (in late 90. you heard it almost every day on radio, at leas in my coutry).
Why is this so short 😩😩😩😩
OMG 😲 nostalgia 😍
All 5 were amazing! But WOW Kirstie looked stunning.
I'm loving thisss
Well done!! 90’ rocked!! Good tunes !!
AMOOOOOOOO! INCREÍBLE LO QUE HICIERON
I love how Mitch doesn't even move his arms, but he still manages to convey joy with just his facial expressions and slight movements of his head. And his smile is SO beautiful.   Also, am I the only one here who thinks they should do a full version of literally every song in this medley? They just sounded so perfect, I WANT MORE!!!
I'm dying for their Believe in full version!!!
I do not mean to be that person but Everytime we touch did not come out on the 90s
She missed her lips with the lipstick... about 3 inches over
I demand a part 2 cause there are more 90s hit s yall Aint even touch yet
I’m so glad to see they’re still alive and thriving together
В постсоветском пространстве хоть что-то своё было?🤦‍♀️🤣 все наши хиты 90х оказывается плагиат🙈 Pentatonix the best!
Love you guys big fans
that transition to Blue rlly got me, talk abt a guilty pleasure song
I'd say nothing against a full 90s dance music album. really good compositions, wouldn't have thought that my favorite music styles will come together at one point
Omg no lie! Out of all of their melodies. By far this one stops my list! Soo good! Pentatonix for the win!👍❤
I screamed during the full video but in the believe part oh my sweet lord I almost died Yas yas yas yas yas YAAAAAAASSSSSSS YAS!!!!!!!
Love 90s dance!
Don't know why but I cannot stop crying because they truly sound amazing😭😭😭
I love everything about this
Felicitaciones Kevin Por Ser Papá, me emocioné cuando me enteré 😂😎
KIRSTIE TE AMOOO CON MI ALMAAAA😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
One word..........AMAZING!!! Loved it!!!
Def my  erra and this was so fun to watch.You are all so individually talented. Thank you for bringing me and everyone around the world  joy tonight! 🥰🌹🙏😁
ohyeayy
Wow,!  Amazing voices. Pentatonic never disappoints 🎶🤗
There goes Mitch trying trying sell me used cars again!
Y’all crushed it as always. Sang all the hits.
But not all songs are from the 90s 🤔
Scott's sass in this video. That's it.
@marcioguerracanto
Can you please do 2000 medley? thanksss❤️❤️❤️❤️
No shade to Ari cus hw was the Original Bass but the new guy, Matt kills it! And i am so happy when Kevin sings! He's got a really nice and clear voice!
y'all guys amazing.. i'm bless everytime hear your voices ♥️♥️♥️
I was born in the year of Our Lord 1970. So, those 5 minutes and 43 seconds were a compressed review of my cafe/club/disco/open air visits that I did in my 20's. Thanx, PTX!
mitch is like Freddie mercury's proud son
Wow
as a European I literally grew up with all of these lmao
Really awesome!
Well... I found the new elder millennial HOUSE CLEANING JAM 2021... 😍🥰🤣
More, please! Full versions would be AMAZING!! This is brilliant! 💎
Gen-X blast from the past. Hubby's into classic house/dance, he loved this!
Like this to get on the VengaBus 🚌
Así de old estoy ... que buenos recuerdos.
This is awesome!!! It was a throw back for sure!!!
plz watch this m/v ONF "beautiful beautiful" https://youtu.be/0pwBFTUJBzQ   kpop+a cappella 2:26~   Not as much as pentatonix,but they also tried something new.
This was amazily soo goood!!!
❤️🎶 I needed these vocals so much! ❤️🎶 I live for it!
2:12 leaving this for me
That everytime we touch is so good
🔥 SHHEEEEEEESSSSSHHHHHH 🔥
I mean, I love this medley, but... Everytime We Touch by Cascada came out in 2006
Aaahhhh! Cascada! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😻😻😻😻😻😻
I love them all 🤗 But Kirstin Maldonado's makeup is so amazing and she looks super yummy 😍😍😍
Long-time fan, but I'm blown away by this. Phenomenal.
just Better off alone on loop. Someone do this please.
Waiting for the full length 90s album 😍
I'm gonna need full versions of all of those... What a nostalgic trip!
I Love It so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️ amazing Memories!!! Thank  you. 🙏 You are the best. Kisses from Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Well done! Great voices and clever arrangement!
I know every song lol
I owned all the Dance Mix USA cds. I can here them all from this Mashup.
Love it!!! @PTXofficial can you please do an 80's counterpart or an Earth, Wind and Fire medley? I'm a big fan of EWF and would love to hear you sing their hits <3
Where can i get those big chunky hoops pleaseeeee?
My love for 90’s dance music has made a return lately. So this could not have come at a better time!! Love love love it!!!! ❤️🎼❤️
Am i to be embarrassed because i know all those songs? But i am not..i am actually proud and rejoicing!  Yessssssss
This is amazing. Congrats to Kevin on his baby!!!
Could you guys do a full version of Everytime we Touch - Cascada? That was/is like my go to uplifting song. You guys would smash it!
518 dislikes must be people from the 60s
Stronger than a 90's trend
I miss youu!! You never lose your brand, I'm proud!
Perfect! But Cascada's Everytime We Touch is from 90's?
Oh my gawd! I love it!!!! It is absolutely AMAZING!!!
Maravilhosoooooo! 👏👏👏👏
Me: I stfg if they don’t include be my lo....oh thank god
Lovely medley, please do a linkin park's next
Mad respect for them! Haha
Felicitaciones a todos les quedo super 👍👍👍👍👍❤
Major love for the group!  Great medley!
This is the best 1990s dance medley ever!  Love all the songs.
Wow🔥🔥🔥🌋
Please do a full version of gypsy women by crystal waters!
hmmmm why put everytime we touch when the original isn't dance and left Whigfield aside? hmmmmhmm  having said that... this was one awesome medley! thanks for sharing it!
I love the 90's so much! With all these songs I can remember my childhood. Thank you!
The moment I saw this I was hoping Cascada would be in it. But I looked it up and it was released in 2005 so imagine my surprise when it popped up while I was googling the release date.
I flippin LOVE this. The 90s were the best time!
Great performance, people! Thanks 4 all you doin
I think that Believe is BEGGING to have a full ver tbh
wahou !!!!!!! magnifique  vous êtes fabuleux bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video is 🔥 (like the roof)
i gotta hear that 80's melody next
oh how i missed their melodys
They are just so damn good.
When it will be on Spotify? 😍
BRING SCOMICHE BACK
CONGRATS KEVIN
wow... just wow
And magically I'm back in college........
1:38  *Song plays *animation meme flashbacks*
Their best medley along with the Perfume one.
Love the new looks!
ALL OF MY CHILDHOOD ROLLER RINK ANTHEMS
It's hard to remember what Kirstie used to look like before she was botched
Ben Shapiro is in Pentatonix?
You do the song from Night at the Roxburry with out the Head bop?! Not 90's! :-P
90's music is like all EDM
Guapisimo
Anyone else want a PTX cover of Everytime we touch now?? They killed that!!!
Love it! Wow!
ATC - All Around The World  Cascade - Every time We Touch was not songs in the 90s
I feel like Im a teenager all over again...Their tallent never ceases to amaze me!!
they should make an album for this
This is so nostalgic. :)
Nostalgia attack! If you know some or maybe all these songs than u r legit 90's kid.
I'm 60 and I really enjoy their music, listen to it all the time.
I wish one day you would sing “unchained melody”
big artist, voices great
Mitch’s highnotes... ❤️
Can we just talk about the fact that dude legit looks like tony Montana and freddy mercury had a love child
Amazing!!!!!
They are such a joy to listen to.
PLEASE DO A 80's and 2000'S!!!
Does anyone else think that Mitch is going through a mid life crisis. also congrats Kevin on becoming a dad!!!
I'm a simple man, I see Pentatonix, I click.
I will never get tired of listening to them...soooo good!!❤
when this starts does anyone else hear the x-men theme???
Love them! But trying to figure out if they did her lips like that on purpose for the 90s or not cause I can’t stop laughing 😂
Beautiful, BUT you took all the dance music at the edge from dance music... Italian EuroDance that was the real KING of Dance music, you mentioned only Eiffel65-Blue................. That's a shame!  you took Cher.......... but not Alexia, DoubleYou Gigi D'Agostino Dj Dado Dj Ross Erika and maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaany more... I agree only with Haddaway and LaBouche, but JLo Waiting for tonight that I love but it's not a reppresentative for Dance Music... 90s Dance Music is another thing guys, REALLY!
Its really good but they're songs from the '00s in this mix that should be in another video.
This whole medley is 🔥🔥 Also a major congratulations is in order to Kevin and his wife for becoming parents to a beautiful baby girl!👶🏻🍼❤️❤️
It’s my clubbing years in a medley.
Меня разорвало с плейлиста. Браво!
Can y’all do the BeeGees melody next please ? They are such a vibe !
I so wish I could download this song. This medley so brings me back to my teenage years!!
Интересно, с этого трека тоже капает денежка Руки Вверх?
I WANT THIS ON APPLE MUSIC RIGHT NOW!!! 😭😭😭😭
I would love for them to look this great and be in pyjama pants
OMG !!!  I was smiling during the entire video!!! This reminded me so many memories!!! Merciiiiiii!!
Mitch singing I'm Blue's hook - things you didn't know you needed in your life.
Proof that the 90s were a great music decade, I love all of these songs so much!!
i did not realize i needed this but goddamn i did
This is A cappella? come on, no way! they are A cappella gods!
That hair lol
you know this was Mitch's idea right?
love love love love love!!!!! I'm so glad they did this. This is the sort of thing they've been missing since losing Avi.
I wanna hear a full version of Boom Boom Boom by y'all!
The first Pentatonix video I disliked. So much make up I thought I was watching a cartoon (way too much even for 90s), lip sync (!) was way off,  video editor should be fired right on the spot - it felt like a clip done by a 15yo TikToker who discovered slide effects and mushrooms at the same time;  all in all nauseating.
Now I want that Cher song cover to be made from start to finish... *^_^*
aw when it ended i said out loud "aw thats it? i want more!"
🙁These guys used to do wonders with their voices.... now they are so distorted and enhanced with computers that one can’t really say they are singing at all, more like sampling o auto tuning themselves to a robotic sound 🤖 🎹
Great👍👍👍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Urgh this made me feel old in the MOST FUN WAY. sooo good
So many memories of clubbing in the 90s. Best Medley ever.
Yes, yes, yes 😍😍😍
As usual, stunning. I so want to see you guys live... you know, when the world gets fixed
I feel bad for my iconic toy phone ringtone little butterfly didn't make it here 😭  Time to set up my DDR then
Ah, the memories.
❤️
Great medley but "every time we touch" is not 90s....at least not from Cascada...Maggie Reilly is the original singer and interpreter
4:44 my fav omg
Kurwa it’s so good !!!
А вы знали какие Юлик и Кузьма хорошие?
Pentatonix just keeps getting Better!!!!
Меня накрыли флэшбеки с дискотеки в пионерском лагере))
U were my childhood What happend
What about "king of my castle"???
Absolute classics! Nailed it ❤️
What a fantastic flashback!
Everyone's petitioning for full versions of Every Time We Touch and Blue, but It Feels So Good needs more appreciation!!!!
I want to listen to cascade full ver
"EVERYBODY DANCE NOW"  was the goose bumps🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 ~hugs~ from Brazil🇧🇷
Just Amazing How Cool those Voices Are 🥂👋👋😇
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
i wanted to throw my phone when i heard the beginning of "It Feels So Good" by Sonique at 1:52 ...They really killed this like they do everything!
I need a full cover for all the songs please
All: Boom Boom Boom Boom Mе: НУ ГДЕ ЖЕ РУЧКИ, НУ ГДЕ ЖЕ ВАШИ РУЧКИ!!!
I want this as Spotify playlist
I can't get over how good this is...the vocals, the visuals!<3
Thank u for video :) it wants  u 2 get up and dance  and party :) 🙂🙃🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧 great remix:)

Pentatonix forever i loved
FLAWLESSSSS
Simply awesome! 😍😍😍

Tik tok generation leave the chat
It has 1M views in 3 days. Wow
Great voices but her lips are so bad plastic job. 🙄
OMG, this such a return back to the early days of Pentatonix.  Reminds me of your Swedish House Mafia mashup!  Great nostalgia for the era, too.
Awesome! I'm a 90ies kid, so I knew literally every song haha. Really enjoyed it guys, THANKYOU!
WHERE IS THE SPOTIFY, APPLE MUSIC etc. -VERSION???????
This is probably the best thing you guys have come out with in a while, and that's saying something, cuz the last album was AMAZING

Absolutely amazing!!
lol vous m'avez fait repenser a trop de truc d'enfance :)
YES! This is so fabulous!!!
My whole childhood in one medley, so many forgotten memories popping up in my head!

I'm sure you understand that I NEED CeCe Peniston - Finally and Robin S. - Show Me Love to be full covers. PLS! 😍
I really want to hear each of these covers in their entirety. I would seriously buy an album of just this!
By far this is their best dance medley yet!!! Love this group!

Kirstin killed this!  She has such a great pop voice!
give them a Grammy for this
새벽 3시에 둠칫둠칫
This was great! I'd love to see one for the 80's.
Yo like literally every time i thought "Hey i hope they do so and so" it was the next one that they would sing. Great job PTX ya never fail me
I just find out that Avi lest the group.... 😭💔
Kirstin😍
Kristen is sultry and gorgeous here.
Esto es asombroso
This was a great mix, but aren't some of these songs post 90's? Cascada, for example, was '05.
Świetne, brawo
spectacular! I officially went back to my childhood, great job, congratulations !! 😍🤩🎉
Uhhh love love this..thank you..this was the time to fly
This video LOOKs SO GOOD??? The outfits the transitions the everything!
Wasn't Believe one of the songs they were going to do on The Sing-Off? Glad they finally got around to it.
YO these were all bangers, I remember all of them haha
WOW
Have they ever looked better? WOW talk about 5 full packages!
Absolutely loved it 🥰👍🏻👏🏻🎶🎵🎼 90’s!
3:16 Scott's vocals here were everything!!
Does anyone know if this will be available on Spotify?
PTX, LOVE FROM INDONESIA <3!
I NEED COVERS FOR ALL THESE SONGS NOW! I was  born in 84 and this medley means a lot. Thanks guys.
As a 90's kid, this is a trip down memory lane! Omg! Love it!
Blasting Better Off Alone in my car now.
Dance Mix 95 MEGAMIX!! Killer 🤘🏼
How is nobody talking about life after love? Best heartbreaking ever and the pentatonix Version is as expected even better!
Amazing pentatonix
So much fun to watch you, guys! As always, amazing performance! Is it weird I know all songs? I feel old! hahaahahha! Kevin, congratulations for becoming a dad! Stay safe, guys!
Your video editor deserves a raise
Some good old Pentatonix style !!! <<<3333
This made my day❤️❤️❤️
I normally love everything they do...this not so much.  It was meh.
After you begin to dance from your friend mobile without realize that this is from Pentatonix and there is no music instrument ... Always amazing
i clicked not knowing what to expect but then i remembered im listening to Pentatonix... and it did not disappoint
Can we talk about the glow up of everyone ? They are so beautiful
I love how you can so clearly see their quirks in this video, especially Scott. he has all these signature expressions and gestures that are just so cool!  0:23 the hand twist 0:25 swipe of a finger 1:05 the hand raise and head turn when he hits the highest note 1:10 the quick gesture to the camera 1:29 raised hand 1:45 *boom boom boom boom* 3:16 this whole song’s section 3:50 hand gesture 4:51 the dance thing
So perfect....
Just amazing
Lo ame,son fantásticos y que recuerdos 👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍👌👌👌
As usual Pentatonix went innnn but babyyy the editor truly did what needed to be done! Amazing job all around!!
My heart ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
LOVE ITTTT Could you guys please make a cover of You're the One That I Want from Grease? 😭
Kirsten used to be so gorgeous with her unique gorgeous look.. wish Hollywood didn't get to her like it has...
OMG!!! This is insane !!! Incredible as always!
Everytime We Touch was released in 2005  but that doesn't change the fact that this was _awesome!!!!_
This is so epic! I feel old listening to this, but please more C&C Music Factory and Cher. I could keep this on loop. And I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Mitch! Just had to throw that in as well.
I just realized that Ava Max's song "My Head My Heart" has the same note as "Its all around the world just lalalalala"
Scott🔥
I really love PTX, but I'd like to listen their version on a country rock medley
Oh my goodness! So much nostalgia and goosebumps. 😍
Still my fave aCapella group...
You have made one 90s kid very happy!! This is a bop 😁❤️
Why you guys are so lovable? ❤
I love this group!!
Kevin, Jesus christ, Pure talent
Ok, took me a sec to get into but this is amazing
omg this look on her! <3
Wow. Love it... 👌🏻👍🏻🤩  I wish there would be Vengaboys, Cher, Everytime We Touch and Ace Of Base as full versions... That would be great...
As a rule I don't really dance, but DAYUM this mix makes me wanna get up and move! 🔥 Excellent work!
THIS IS PERFECT 😍😍😍.
Fantástica selección, me han hecho recordar la niñez con tanta buena música.
this kind of medley by pentatonix made me felt like it was 2015 again. ahhh good times <3 <3 <3
Quick question. Cascada everytime we touch came out in 2006?
After seeing many of their performances and following them, they can still amaze me with their undeniable talent. ♥️ them!
Wow, imagine that i'm  dancing a 90s disco
Oh those sweet memories from the teen years :-D That was straight down memory lane ;-) Thank you guys, you are absolutely amazing
This is amazing. Just amazing. You all are so talented and just keep doing this.
クセになる〜最高です☺️
Love 0:59 ❤️
I literally know all of these songs. And I love all of them. And Pentatonix is a killer combination. 🤯🤩🔥❤️
love the songs in this medley
One of the best mixes of music I have ever heard.  I can not get enough of their wonderful music.
Awesome as usual! But.. Im sad, that they decide to use auto-tune..
I don't know where to start on how amazing this is. I mean we know they can sing the phone book and make it sound epic so I'm going to focus on the wardrobe. How beautifully tailored Mitch's clothes are. I mean, I've been so used to seeing him in oversized clothing for so long, my mouth was open the whole time. How can these people be so beautiful ALL THE TIME!!! Scott: the hair, the diamond glasses and yellow jacket, Kirstin: the metallic silver and the curls, Matt: the checkered and red jackets! Kevin: classic black and white never looked so good! Always joy whenever I watch them. Love love love!
I agree, Mitchell has the most beautiful voice! But I feel you all have unique, beautiful talents. I would Love to hear you do an A Capella version of "Come a Little Bit Closer" by Jay and the Americans. May Date me, but a classic song and great for dancing.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
The female member is really white washed looking. Be original girl!!!
Scott’s sunglasses!!! AHHH!!!! 🥰  that’s all ☺️
This needs to be a whole album! Those snippets of the songs were NOT long enough! This is everything!! 🤩
Everytime We Touch was a BOP
Amazing!!!  Love every second of this compilation.  As always, you hit it out of the park!!
Cascada!  Epic mix y'all!
Oh god this is aweeee!!!
is it okay to be in love with five at once?
And just like that, I'm transported back to my '88 Corolla, cruising the streets of my home town... Showing my age
You're guys so so amazing 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Am I the only one who loves how these guys smile "to us" when they are singing?. When you are fed up with so much "noisy music" they arrive and transform everything into music for the soul.
SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTT LOOKS SOOOOO-SEEEEEEE-XXYYYYYYYY my god...
OMG! I want a full version of ´It Feels So Good - Sonique´, no I need it! <3
Everytime we touch was the 00s but its still a bop!
A request from faraway Siberia. Please record each song in full!
this is like all those dance anthology CDs they advertised on commercials growing up
Can you sing the full version of the song 'wanna be my lover'
I was really surprised to hear a song by A Touch of Class! Not many people have heard of ATC!
Anybody else realise that half these songs aren't 90's dance?
Okay but that yellow jacket and pair of glasses make Scott look even more fly. Their voices are amazing! Totally jamming to this while I clean the house to give me energy.
Love all the Dutch tracks in there! Crazy to think that Alice DJ (Better off alone) and the Vengaboys (boom boom boom boom!) are basically the same person.
Omg this is so nostalgic! 🥺 Good job guys!
So so good.. Pentatonix brilliance as usual 🎶❤️
this is such a mitch medley.. since he loves dance/electronic music
Every time they come out with a new song, I am RE-AMAZED that it is f**king acapella....
Н. Кто-то остался равнодушным?! Друзья! Спасибо, что Вы с нами. Прошу прощения.
Please do a second one!! There’s a few iconic 90s dance songs that were missed: “Anywhere USA” —don’t remember the artist “Hamster Dance” “We Like to Party”
Amazing. All the time
The 90’s along time ago 💔
Excelent!!!
Can you do an Imagine Dragons medley
Love era 90s ❤ songs
Scott 💜
MASTERPIECE!!!
5min und 43sek gänsehaut!
Kok ada lagu "cinta satu malam, oh indahnya
I hope you make medely from bruno mars (full album)
Please do a Taylor Swift song evolution.🧡🧡❤
You all have such beautiful voices! I was jamming the whole time. 93 baby here.
Epic!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I CRIED when they did BELIEVE OMFG CHER WOULD BE SO GLAD
ah yes, we needed this. This is what they do best IMO. Sounds so good!
This is fire, I love it! I need a full version of It feels so good.
Bloody awesome 😳😳😳
I want this to on Spotify
Just loved it! You are fantastic, guys!
💃🏻🥳
Holy hell that's some fire well done
Great job!!!
i love it
Besides the fact Cascada was a 2000s band,  this is all iconique
ICONIC
Cascada <3 #Germany
My god, how many memories🙈 I'm starting to cry (happy tears) 😍😍😍😭😭😭
I love all of you! I hope pentatonix to keep making their performances cause they're so cool
You Arte best ever
Mega 🌹
465 ppl have bad taste in music and only listens to K-pop
So when will pt. 2 be coming out?
Not all of these are 90's songs though... 🤓
Why is this not on Spotify???????? LOVE IT!!!!! <3  This is spot on 90s.  Now, do the 80s. Love to hear some glamrock og real pop. Whitesnake, Europe, Whitney Huston, Wham, A-ha. Some real great singers from the 80s. And some not so good singers, but till good music... Modern Talking, Limahl,  talking heads, Prince, Madonna...   <3  I love the simplicity in the video. Cudos to the editor!!!!! And the stylist!  And the photographer and the assistants and the whole crew behind PTX videos! And  PTX!!!!!
日本人いるかい？ ペンタトニックス良いよなぁ
Okay now I simply NEED a full track of Believe by PTX
Calling all Indonesians who vibin 2:15 as "Cinta Satu Malam" 💃🕺
Amazing content. I used to be a D.J in 90s... All parts "known to bones" :) Lovely accomplished!
...i smell a full 90s Pentatonix album.
I was jumping through the whole mix...dang 90's music was sweet
I loved this so much
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great video, the only complain I have is that 2 of the songs are released in 2000 (This video is about songs from the 90s after all) and you could have included something from the Backstreet Boys, Spice girls or Britney Spears.... they have a lot of dance songs too.
Ingenious and all those 90 medley I feel in love and it's beautiful include believe they it's mind blowing
A trip down memory lane!
My childhood, thanks 😘🇭🇺
This is so awesome!!!
How many like me wanna hear the full version of all the song in this medley?😍
You know you’re old when you can sing every song out loud 😂😅😓
maybe try before you go?
I grew up listening to each of these songs, how nice it is to hear them again with people as talented as Pentatonix, without hesitation, we need more of you, they are another level.
"Everytime we touch" complete please.
1:29 Oh my god the way the sound bounces around. I love it.
ACA-MAZING! 😍😍😍
Okay but we need a full version of Boom Boom Boom  PLEASEE
So much nostalgia. This is how you remind me that I'll be 35 this year. This is like the soundtrack of my entire childhood and into my teens.
Impresionante quedo perfecto, crecí escuchando estás canciones y ahora puedo disfrutarlas con estas maravillosas voces. 🥰🥰
SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!
Kristin will you marry me 😍😍😍  Everytime we touch 2:14 🔥🔥🔥
oh the nostalgia!
This is in my era,I love the 80's-90's music
not only they are the reason that I love accapella so much but they surprise me with every new video more and more ♡
This is what the world needs now. Thank you
Still can't get over this masterpiece🥰🥰🥰

Super
I love that you sing from your hearts, thus it goes to my heart! I love your singing and i am singing along also when i press play. Keep do what you love because it is great!
I just can't get over how talented Pentatonix is. I don't understand how there are people who hate them when you look at the number of dislikes!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏🤩👍👍👍💃
WHAT?!? No Barbie Girl?!
Epic as always :)
Can we have this on spotify plssssss WE WANT MORE PENTATONIX!!!! 😍😍😍
1:29 ...."everywhere!" I'M SOOO IN LOVE....AND ITS EVERYfuckingWHERE 💕💕💕💕💕

Wow, this really takes me back. Absolutely spot on!
Solid pentatonix fan since 2012!! Love all your performance!
Amazing! Nice to finally see Mitch smiling again!
Damn, this brought back my childhood. So good!
Oh my gosh guys, this is amazing!! I love y’all so much!💙  Also, full Boom Boom Boom when??👀
WHY SO SHORT?!?!!!
the way most of these are meme songs for gen z
Believe by Cher will forever be the ONLY song you HAVE to put autotune on the vocals. It just doesn't work otherwise. 🙈❤️🤣
PETITION TO HAVE A FULL ALBUM OF ALL THESE SONGS. I WILL START A GOFUNDME IF I HAVE TO XXXXXX
¡Hacen un trabajo realmente hermoso! Me encantaaaa
i cannot get enough of this!!
Who thumbsed up the moment the title came on?
🧡🎶🧡🎶🧡🎶 Loved it!
After all these years I still can’t get over Mitch’s vocal range. These guys are all so insanely talented and this medley is so nostalgic. Literally all the music I grew up with when I was younger.
Damn that was 🔥🔥 I agree you guys should do some throwback 70's, 80's, and early 20's mixes. Pure talent 🖤
this is awesome!  do a 90's rap medley
They are all so beautiful.
All the songs I danced to when I was a kid. Amazing medley...reminded me of a lot songs I have forgotten through the years. Time to re listen to them.
Loved this, but I can't get over Kirsty's overfilled lips and Mitch's botox. I feel like it really impedes their ability to truly express what they're singing. And they are both SO GORGEOUS without any help! Kirsty was absolutely killing those curls though, honestly she's a goddess.
Where is britney spears huge hit "baby one more time"  ? 😡
I can see them winning another Grammy for this...
全曲フルで歌って欲しいですね！！！！
Mitch's coolness factor is at 1000%; Scot's lock of hair in his first look and shades in the second look; Kirstie's hoops in her second look and her hair; Matt's bass Matt's bass Matt's base and Kevin, the King of the Beat.... they are perfect.
WAO... the medley we 90s kids didn't know we needed and now can't live without
WoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooW
at the first seconds i was like "bruh, is it gonna be just randomly parts of random dance songs of the 90's?" but as it went on, i noticed the vocal post procesing efects... and sure enough it slowly got better. well done
This is a shot of nostalgia straight to the dome 😆
OMG CASCADA
My childhood 💜💜 Oh my word this is amazing.
This is so good!!! Can we get a full version of Better Off Alone pls, like their arrangement of that riff was so beautiful I just want to listen to that part on loop haha
Is it sad that I have every single one of the songs on CD? This is a killer medley, and it has me digging in the closet for all those old CDs after all these years.
Massive trip down memory lane and I'm killing it on the dancefloor!
AMAZING❤️❤️❤️
PETITION FOR PENTATONIX TO COVER THE WELLERMAN SEA SHANTY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2:14 Cinta satu malam, oh indahnya Cinta satu malam, buatku melayang. 😂

90s grunge and 90s pop would make my day! It was my whole life growing up!
I like how you sounded here guys. Matt is already improving. It's totally awesome. You're getting back to the sound that you had when Avi was still the base. I like the vibe. It's totally fantastic.😊😊😊
Millenials be like 👁👄👁
This is what we all needed! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Oh, the memories this medley has brought back! And wow! The vocals, arrangements, and transitions once again show off y'all's amazing talents! Bonus for the killer styling, too!

Cool but pls next time add a warning for epilepsy... Some of the edits could be dangerous
Amazing, just amazing
Thank you, love youu ❤️❤️❤️
The way this gave me flashbacks to youth group field trips to the skating rink 😍
Whoa, Kirsty's hair looks AMAZING in that style!
Taking me back to my raving days...the 90's were the best!!
amazing!!!!
Love this so much! They did such a great job with this. I could listen to this all day!
Pentatonix sings my playlist lol!!! PERFECTION!!!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Fun!!!!!😍
This... might actually be my new favorite of their videos.
da haben sich ein paar 2000er eingeschlichen
Make believe with a full music please
Simplemente genial
The fam and i are huge fans! You all are my kids’ fave for Christmas music. And now this! I didn’t want it to end!! Amazing. Can you do another one? 90s too or maybe 80s?!!!
F A N T A S T I C
Wow, y'all covered EVERY BASE!  Late 90's, Sonique and Eiffel 65 were my jam.  Wonderful, fun mix, thank you!
I miss them doing covers like this.
90's best era period
Excellent summary of "The Assassination Gianni Versace"
To much filtering and electric addition.
evolution of rock?
Wow some really great songs in here!!!
KIRSTIE LOOKS STUNNING AS ALWAYS OMGG
How much fun!!!
It's like I'm back in the day dancing at Toto's and Paladrome 😄😄😄
So good but that JLo song seemed so out of place.
Here before trending!
Oh my, I missed you guys! Everyone popped off😩😩
If this doesn't feel like a 10-min song and makes you wanna dance...
These voices do not need auto tune.  Didn't need them for dog days and they don't need them now.
Thank you for making this it's amazing 👏❤
Loved Ace of Base and Casscada!! I remember all these but loved those the most
I've been away from Pentatonix for so long... did she get her lips done??? why?
omg i love this! i missed this!!
Never gonna give you up. With Scott as the lead would be cool.
LOVE THIS
You guys are exceptional as always 👏
So fun!!!
I love when you can see genuine excitement and joy in their faces when they perform, I can't stop smiling when watching this especially when Mitch smiles 😁
I feel like I need full versions of all of these songs so I can jam to them again
This. Is so absolutely iconic
Maravilhosos 👏👏👏👏
.... AND You guys are back with a bang!!!! What a friggin fantastic medley!! Always biased since I am a 90s kid!! You guys fill my life with SO MUCH JOY!!
Amazing ! Love this
Muy buena elección de canciones . Hermosas voces,  felicitaciones.  Buenos Aires,  Argentina
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I love the bright smile from Matt ❤️ it's contagious 😊😊
アカペラなのが信じられない
THIS IS SO GOOD! also lets appreciate the scott sunglasses moment bc that was impeccable
Love Love Love this. Pentatonix looks so healthy and happy and I hope they are. This is just shared happy vibes.
They need to do a Cher tribute ❤
you guys should do phantom of the opera 😱😱
i am in LOVE WITH THIS.
Wonderful group
They aren’t entertaining anymore. Yawn.
This was ICONIC! ✨ this was such a fun time for music ‼️
Adding this to my workout routine, this is amazing!
❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Well, that's a lot of songs I haven't thought about in the longest time smashed together. But in a fantastic way.
So good! The sound. The look.  Just so fly!
If y'all would pick just any one of these songs and cover the whole thing.  Any one.  This is my most favorite genre.
Thats was great!  But to short 😕 Wow!  what a beautiful voices 😍❤
KILLED IT! Absolutely amazing!
soooo epic!!!!
GOD I FRIGGEN LOVE PENTATONIX
OMG Sonique.
2nd part please!!! 90's is gold
I missed this ❤️
Any song pentatonix sing makes it so beautiful. Idk but I'll wait till they make a medley of meme songs. I bet it sounds way better if they sing it.
thank you for your works, it is awesome as always.
This is so groovy and nostalgic. These guys just keep getting better
This is fire 🔥🔥
3:28 scott: OWO
I love how their voices individually have evolved over the years and how it continues to shape their whole sound!! They continue to amaze me
Cascada was 90s? 🤔
No 90s medley would be complete without "Running in the '90s" though 😉
Liking before actually playing the video because you know they won't disappoint!  Update: I was right! SOOOO GOOD! ❤️❤️❤️
AYO SOMEBODY TAKE THOSE TINY ASS GLASSES AWAY FROM SCOTT
PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THIS 😭❤️ YOU GUYS ARE REALLY GREAT!
Дорогие PTX !!! Вы лучшие и замены вам нет!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I...didn’t realise how old I was until this video
Incredible!!!! I want more 90’!!!
Mitch's voice has me like la la la la la!!! I love the range you have!!! Scott that look with the brown coat.....works!!!! Love the scruff and the hair!!!
1:17 magic
Perfection!!! You guys are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G 😍😍😍
Brilliant!
This takes me back!  Edit! Please, no more autotune! I want to hear your renditions, not what's already been done
i love Kristins hair
Question. How does an accapella group do auto-tune? Just curious, you cant do Believe without it.
Sooooo ICONIC. Sonique, Cascada and Cher were my faves...
懐かしい曲ばかり！！！
SO AWESOME PENTATONIX😆😆😆😆😆😆!
Oh boy, I loved most of this songs when they were new. Heard them up and down when I drove. Ok, I am feeling old now...
Love this, wish it was on Spotify
You guys never fail to amaze me.
Loving those high pitches
They can sing Christian songs
You should do full versions of some of these songs.
I just heard part of this while scrolling through insta and I knew I had to find this masterpiece
Matt singing Cher got me SO good.
The only songs this is really missing is Mel C’s “I Turn to You” and Gigi Agostino’s “L’Amour Toujours” But I popped SO hard for Sonique.
This medley is so dope!! Love it!!
Thanks for appreciation  of a good thing
Brought me back, brought me life.  Loved it!!
buenisimo!!!
💖💖💖💖💖
Pentatonix: *use any kind of electronic sound effect*  Half the comments: "😤Why are you using so much autotune??? 😩You didn't used to use autotune!"
I'm feeling like playing DDR for the first time 🤣
New to ptx officially now a pentaholic cannot get enough and I am a great grandmother keep them coming ptx your fabulous
Once upon a time in 2011 during the Sing-Off Season 3, PTX was going to sing a version of “Do You Believe In Love After Love” as part of the competition show. It never happened and they did a stellar arrangement of “Video Killed the Radio Star” instead. I’m happy we finally got to hear a PTX version of that song in this medley!
More 90's please!
They should do 90's R&B please!
woooow
Pentatonix are the Nickelback of pop music
they just unlocked a deep memory in my brain bringing these songs back to me
Wow! It’s only been two days and it already has 839k views!! This is amazing!
A little disappointed it wasn’t completely acapella, still good though.
Mitch!!
One of my favorites yet!
Faltou don't wanna short dick man
OMGOODNESS this is  insane‼️😳‼️😳‼️🙄‼️😳‼️🙄 Absolutely love this so much, found myself guessing what track would be next, could have been so many more tracks to this, A W E S O M E👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 And I want Matts  blacken’ blue Jacket 😂
Many of my childhood favorites! 😍❤️
As always - absolute perfection 🙌🏻😍
What's with all the autotune? I mean, yeah, the 90s, but these guys don't need it and they have completely changed all their voices.
This is Amazing!❤🔥🎵👌
This is Mitch's playground! Great mashup guys.
What did they do to Mitch's voice on the I'm blue song. It sounded like they took out his voice and put in the original. That's so amazing
It’s the video editing for me
Wooooow💯🔝💯
Only 30 secs in I know I'm gonna love. Especially with Kirsten's hair and Scott's glasses
did i just hear the night at the roxbury soundtrack?
This is my childhood, thank's my dears)PeaceV)
Doing Blue and Believe without auto-tune, but sounding almost the same, now that is some talent!
Scott's rocking those glasses!!
now i need covers from all of these
Sensacional!!!
I feel really seen. This is definitely high school for me!
Nice job, kids. I can really tell you are all developing as artists and people.
Amazing! 👍
You've lost it. Whatever it was. !❤
Ahhh my playlist
https://youtube.com/c/International3rdEye
Well, guess I've got my monday playlist sorted. These guys and 90's Eurodance. Good combo :D
You're welcome 20 year olds...  all these songs remind me of the skating rink!!!
4:02 meanwhile in an alternate universe where SONOS is still in
Wooooh!! 90s songs!! Living my childhood all over again!! 🥳🥳
Flashback to high school and university days. This was absolutely amazing. A much needed smile. Thank you, PTX. 😎👍💟
🔝🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏
I knew every one. In fact, most of them are on my 'workout playlist' and now I need to go and sit down because my back hurts and I can't remember where I put my keys.
This sounds like a high school talent show
IMMACULATE
And then there’s me who wasn’t alive in the 90s and only recognized the meme songs
I am a 2000s kid but 90s is life. So are the 80s. I cherish other eras though. But really I loved this medley.
Yo,. A friend sent this to.me today! Totally.awesome!!! If you ever come to this area, I'd be the first to grab tickets! Yes, I agree! More decades to master!! Loving it!!!
Is this re-upload ?
First off this is amazing! Second can we pretty please have a full pentatonix cover of everytime we touch?
Brilliant
thats the mitch i  like to   see the one thats smiling about his high notes
OMG love it. Had to dance on my chair to all of them
Will we get it on Spotify?
Phew those high notes! ❤️
Daing I just wish each song had more time lol. I don’t care if the video would have been 15 minutes!
Good, good
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH <3 some of my favorite '90s songs are in this. RoomieOfficial should react to this pls!
❤ the best
It's kinda weird that I was born in 2000 but still know the lyrics to 90% of these songs
We need 90s music style back now.
Didn't realize how much I needed a full Cher Believe cover from them <3
I have a question what is everyone’s range or whatever it’s called soprano tenor bass like that just curious
Five and a half minutes of pure greatness. Can't believe these guys are still killing it.  :)
I really love this piece and most especially the beatboxing guy his voice is lovely and I love him 😁😘
Amazing video 👏
Блеск!!! Браво!!!
Please do an 80's version! For many of us Gen Xer's that was the Holy Grail of music!
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed ... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I think I just heard Pentatonix's 4 th grammy!!
Can we have a 90's dance album?
the real “blue” lyrics are “i’m blue if i’d be green i would die” (instead of “da bu di da”)
Very nice 👏👍
😍😍😍😍😍
Jajaja de seguro soy la unica de a qui ,  que es méxicana y habla español🤚😔
No les pasa que sus voces 👁👄👁💗
Weee su sincronizacion 🤚💗
No les pasa que escuchan esto y se sienten en otro mundo 💗🤚😔
I need a full version of the cher song plz
Kocham was 🥰😍
Their medleys always makes me want them to do individual covers of every song lol
okay they NEEED to remix every time we touch on it's own now!!!!
Kirsten is feeling herself with this lewk and I don’t blame her! Work it!
Супер🔱👏👍🌈⚘⚘⚘💋💋💋
Honestly Mitch should be the lead! He should just sing more often.
A other one..., (please Khaled give me the expression)
How did Pentatonix make me love 90s dance music?
Anyone else think the 90s had the best music?
Please do a full version of "Believe" 🙏
SO good! Mitch completely nailed Better off Alone and Believe! I'd love to hear full versions of those!
Maybe I am the only one but this is one of the worst songs/medleys so far, simply because their voices have been modified too much. Sure, the 90s is all about synths and yes, Autotune was a thing too. But what I admired most by those five awesome singers was their ability to emulate many many of these effects simply with their voices and if they weren't able, they used to adapt and modify the song that it fits their abilities.  Here you can hear right from the start that all voices are heavily modified, effects used, sometimes that much that you can't recognize the real voice anymore.  As much as I like the 90s, as much as I like Pentatonix...they effed up here. You can do better...a lot better!
Mitch is in my top 10 of most interesting male singers  The look the unforgettable sound the aura of presence and mystique  like a 80's boy george meets prince with a truly unique voice
LOVE THIS!!! Love seeing the smile back on Mitch's face, you are killing it in every way, Mitch! Everyone looks amazing the outfit choices are on point  I hope you had as much fun making this video as it looks like you did when I watch the video. Matt your bass is awesome and I loved your vocals on Believe, you rock as always. You all awe me with every new song you put out, you continue to impress me and keep me wanting for more. Love you PTX!
Matt and Kevin are amazing in this. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
can you pls cover every single song in this video in full lenght?!?! <3
What a bop!! ❤️
Jesus Christ Is Lord And He Is Coming Soon Prepare Your House And Remember That He Died For You To Say Goodbye To Sin ❤🙏🏼
❤
YEEEEEES vibing with this while in online class 😭🎧🎶
Scatman could be more powerfull with all your voices together.
CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT HOOPS KRISTEN IS WEARING PLEASE?!?!
Can we have the same with 80s please. It's so amazing.
Was anyone else hoping for Barbie Girl??? 🙊
I love this, brings back great memories!!!!
Dude or whatever is in the middle is creepy af
When you know all of these songs. This touches my soul so much! I would love to hear a bunch of La Bouche covers from them! 😩👌🏼
Wow you guys never cease to amaze me !!!!!!
YES MITCH
petition for a full cover of believe!!
I love how Matt never stops smiling.. never.. ,🥰 They are all so brilliant
Завораживающе !ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
Please make this available in spotify! 😭
So fascinating omg
Amazing! I love it! ❤️
80 s please!!
I would love a complete version of Everytime We Touch, that was amazing! The whole medley was amazing!!
I wish Pentatonix played Eiffel - I'm blue, in full version. It sounds sweeter when they play it.
2:42 Just flashbacks to Mitch and Scott vine days
YES PENTATONIX  I felt like i went back to my childhood and also having an amazing moment in the midst of this crap time! I can partaaayyy in my house as long as Pentatonix is DJ'ing LOL.
WOW VERY IMPRESSIVE. SO BEAUTIFUL. HOPING THAT U ALSO MAY COVER 90'S DISCO. LIKE TARZAN BOY, NEVERMIND, 628 ETC. SO CUTTEE
The pentatonix's, never fail to amaze me . More power to this group 😍
I dont understand... why autotune...
80 please 🤩
AWESOME
Proof before 21st century songs are better even with acapella version where they are in some level of senior. The bass voice is more and more similar to the digital one before time.
The only songs missing are Saturday Night by Whigfeild and 123 Train With Me by Playahitty but otherwise absolutely perfect
We need this on Spotify!!! 🥺🙌🏼✨
Me encanta, me fascinan, me llenan de magia y gloria🖖🔭❤
Such a FUN MUSIC VIDEO! They’re band goals.
Brazil love you
Awesome!!!!
Also the perc on Everybody Dance Now is amazing
Love how well they capture some of the electronica effects
Why do they look like they should be in the 70s and 80s
Wow!
Using auto-tune as a stylistic device only is a flex. Incredible 5 musicians!
I wish theyd actually make songs fit together instead of doing 5 second clips one after the next. If i wanted to click through the radio aimlessly i could do that on my own.
Kirsten has never looked better WOW all her looks took my breath
now Tiktokerists are gonna claim this
Mitch's look ATE
Mitch looking like Freddy Mercury omg
Kirstie's Better Off Alone part really suits her voice. Amazing!!!
❤❤❤👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
♥️
LOVE MITCH'S VOICE💖 IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL 💖 0:05 , 0:29 , 0:53 , 1:13 , 1:39 , 2:01 , 2:56 , 3:11 , 4:31 , 4:45
Wow! The Grammy WINNING Pentatonix Forever!!! So amazing, talented, diverse, perfect from the first competition to today. The community is so PROUD!! KUDOS!!!
Seen them live (uk) love their sounds have almost all there songs .....however this seems a bit overturned and seems like it’s been mechanically helped a lot.....perhaps just take it back a step and be raw and in a room
Love this. ❤️
This 90's dance medley makes me want to dance. 💃🕺
I love all of their outfits in this video. They always have great outfits in their music videos. 😍
PTX the one group who never can be predicted. I'm always impressed. I want to do a guitar battle with Mitch.  A DJ vs PTX medley could be awesome too.  They changed my views on  A Capella music.
For some reason I got some Marilyn Monroe vibes from Kirsten with her short blonde hair and silver dress.
Love it ! even if many of those songs were from the 2000s
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
💜💜💜💜💜
If you don’t get Russian memes, just skip this АЙМ БЛУ ДАБУДИ ДАБУДАЙ ДАБУДИ ДАБУДАЙ ДАБУДИ ДАБУДАЙ
This video made me gayer 💖
Mitch's voice makes me feel bless  Whos with me?
Fantastic! Please do the 70s and 80s next!
毎回凄さを実感する。
Thank you very much for all those best of 90’ medley. All my fav ones ❤️🙏🏻
PTX, I can’t find this on iTunes!! Please release this!
HOLY HELL I just had a near 6 minute quickie trip to my middle school and high school days, that was awesome :D
Dreams came true! Can never get enough of the 90's
Very good 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Damn it I can't stop replaying this medley. I need a whole album just with all of these songs in full!
Cinta satu malam oh indahnyaa
So high quality
Kirsten gave this magic... Just... Love
YASSSS
A amazing
As much as I love this video, every time I watch it it's just strange how for a dance medley there wasn't that much dancing done by them. Also the transitions weren't clean throughout. At the beginning they were kind of just one song pause next song pause next song. They definitely flowed more naturally as the medley went on
最高‼️ Awesome‼️
You guys should do a full cover of “Better off alone”... That was insane!
4:31 Mitch: Do you believe in life after love?  YES! YES MITCH, I DO!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s so strange to think the 90s are the equivalent of the 60s for the 2020s. 30 years have rushed by!
Can they just title this what it’s meant to be called? “Gay Club Anthems of the 90’s and 00’s”
Love this mix, you are amazing! ❤️
This is simply amazing, flawless, the arrangement the song choice for the 90s, everything down to the wardrobe just brilliant. Thank you for continuing to make incredible music!
I knew i’m blue was gonna be in here
I missed their voices AND faces SO MUCH. 😩😍
Lets revive the 90s bring that music and fashion style back non stop clubbing everyone was chill the world was a better more fun place
I was in high school between 1990 and 1995 and uni between 1996 and 1999. This medley literally is my jam. So good.  My favourite bit is the Kirsty/Mitch backing vocals in the chorus of finally. Go listen.
I love that they used auto tune in the style of the original songs
That is fantastic xxx
I’m actualy curious how it would sound without the auto tune in Some songs. I know its in the original to give A certain tech vibe. But it would be awesome to here ptx OWN interpretation / sound instead of the “as close as possible copy”
Right in the nostalgia
Love it because I know the songs lol. 🤩😆 Alice Deejay... Rhythm of the night 🤩🤩 Everytime we touch... Blue dabadee Robyn show me love Jennifer Lopez Waiting for tonight x Cher ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 💕 Beieive The Vengaboys. Boom boom boom  Sonique "Your love feels so good" Finally by Miss Cece 💓
Yaaaaaaaaaassssssss
Very very good.
Eiffel 65!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And suddenly, I'm transported to elementary music class dancing around with my classmates under a strobe light.. wow
Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) ITALIAN VIBEEEEEEEEEEEES !!!
Would be so awesome if you would make an 90s album.
This is incredible, as always... Thanks Pentatonix for doing magic with your voices. You bring rythm to the world!
Wowwww
Omg the red suit guy doing Cher, he needs to sing more with that honey Voice
THE OUT FITS
My brain cells at the online exam
0:37 -- оригинал был написан Сергеем Жуковым из группы "Руки вверх", а потому Пентатониксам большой RESPECT за исполнение :  "Что произошло? Сама не понимаю - песенку одну весь день я напеваю. Все мои друзья поют со мною вместе, может быть и вы споете эту песню?  Припев: Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла весь день я напеваю! Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла весь день я повторяю Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла весь день я напеваю! Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла весь день я повторяю Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла, Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла, Ла-ла-ла-ла-ла..."
This is everything!!!
This was such a nostalgia trip! and amazingly put together! LOVE IT
OBSESSED
Awesome !!! Really, the harmonics and the bass !
Cascada everytime we touch. I need a full version!!
Wow🙀🙀

Sometimes I talk to myself for no reason
Love this!!
THIS is your kind!
It's 2021 and everybody goes retro, I love it!
Amazing)  But you need a bass-singer. Music would sound more solid.
@Pentatonix you NEVAH disappoint....absolutely ♥️this!!!!💃🏾🎶💃🏾🎶...pure talent!!!
Oh My God!! Eu lembrei da Tunnel, uma balada em São Paulo :)
this is amazing and the video is so cool 😍
How come I know almost all of the songs, even though I am a 2000 child? XD
Excellent performance you guys! Greetings from Greece!
I've been waiting for this for so long.
I like medleys, but I'd definitely love to hear full lenght covers of some of these songs please!!  "Around the World" and the one that goes "Everybody Dance Now!" especially intrigued me :)
Wasnt Cascada's Everytime We Touch from 2005????
Awesome!
90s music was so wholesome 😭😭❤️🙌🏾
when will it be released on Spotify !? 😍😍 love it !!!
I love it 😍 😍
I'm LIVING!!!
I anticipated being rickrolled but I realized afterwards that the song was 3 years short of being in the 90s
Omg! The sonique part 😍👌🏼
Please make a cover of boy bands songs. Like The Moffats, backstreetboys, A1, westlife etc.   Anyway, your music is 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ого! Какой удачный образ у девушки! Прямо другой человек)))  Очень шикарно все выглядят и поют! Люблю вас давно)
Your group is literally the example that voice is an instrument and you are amazing. Thank you
3:00 !! L'italia c'è 💙💙
so proud to be a 90s baby right now. LURVE IT!!!
Hey Leute,  ein geniales Medley
Maravilhosos ❤
I can't stop listening to this
This medley brought me into goosebumps.....PTX your brilliant and have intense creative...love your creativity ❤❤❤
Matt is my new Cher! ❤
When is this coming to spotify I need this in my playlist
So nostalgic...love you guys!
If you’re not from the 90s you can’t relate 🤣
Woah😮
NOSTALGIA. AAAAAAAAHHH <3  Admittedly not all of these are 90's (such as the Cascada song, which was 2006!) but who cares this is amazing. :D
99% upvoted but honestly, you're off pitch on most of the songs, and there's almost no performance here outside of the singer. Step it up. Not impressed.
I think all 90's people have at least one of this song stuck on thier brain for years but don't know the name. At least one song😆🤣🤣🤣
I'm waiting for 00s 😻☮️🥰
This was perfection ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing! Awesome! Tks from Brasil.
i’ve listened this an hundrend of times, i can’t stop
WOW!!!!!!!y'all my favorite group sing anything!!!!!!!!
Would love to here this without FX...
They are so underrated. Like their voices are amazing ❤️🔥
Cool
I am a '90s baby and I approve! Let's ride this nostalgia train to the '00s ;-P
yaaaas
Honestly speaking, kirsten and Scott are one of the reasons why I’m bisexual
This makes me feel old because I was born in the 90's but I love this at the same time is that nostalgia factor that I love XD lol
😍😍😍
Hello from russia, it's very beautiful!!
Охеренно!
They did better with all these songs than the originals
Supppperrr!!!!! Love it, love it, love it ❤️
OMG my Childhood!!!!!
ILOVEYOUUUUU 💖💖💖💖💖
It’s seems like kristin loves her curly hair
Absolutely amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
À full 90's album would be awsome !
04:02 cher believe ❤️ l love it
90s dance. Still so good.
Soooo goood!
Memories of the roller skating rink flying back in 😃
I just love them so much.thank you for all this joy
Cascada is not 90s tho...
The La Bouche Cover is so cool ♥️ Could you please make a Full Version of That Song 💪🏻♥️
Well take a full version of "better off alone" ASAP
My HEART AND SOUL ARE NEVER READY FOR WHAT MITCH GIVES US!!!! They are all amazing but gosh he lights my soul !!!🤘😎🔥💀🤩🦄
Anyone else think we need a full cover of everytime we touch?? 🙌🏻🎉
Party 🎊 party🎉
Omg this is all of my 90’s favs in one medley 😍 so talented 😭❤️
the gay one looks funny as hell
When does this release on spotify?
Einfach nur Megaaa, genau solche Musik hört man einfach viel zu selten, und das noch Acca Pella. Einfach nur Megaaa Nice. Dafür gibts auch nen Abbo hinterher.
oh dayum, another one besides those legendary medleys <3
What does Kirsten's tattoo say? Looked like Caramel maybe.
I wanna full version of believe please!!
OMG!!! Nostalgia hits me 😍😍😍
does anyone realize " Everytime We Touch - Cascada" came out in 2006 not 90's.....
Memories stand out in me... Lovely performance!
Wow! I couldn't take my eyes off of Kirsty....or is it Kirsten now? She looks and sounds amazing!
Hold the phone! Did you guys forget “100% Pure Love” by Crystal Waters? What about “Another Night” by M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy?
😍😍😍😍😍 can't break through!!!! The bass part😍😍😍😍
They are so still great!!!! 😭😭😭
OK but can we get full versions of all these songs? Lawdhamercy.
OMG THIS IS SOOOO GOOD! Can you please make a medley for Fearless by Taylor Swift? PLEASE 🥺
PLEASE do a J-Lo evolution medley!
I was hoping for a 90s middle part from Scott
The 90’s were a magical time...
.....damn I want full length versions of ALL OF THESE. Pretty please?
What in the glee
It was awesome hearing Cher in 4 different voices, each one sounding perfect for her song! You guys do such amazing arrangements. There are a lot of good vocalists out there, but I seldom see musicality to match your arrangements and performance!  Unique voicing, sizzling harmonies, musical shaping of a song to convey so much emotion and build to a climax, adding interest to the song...I seriously don't know how you guys manage to do ALL those things you do!
Only PTX can do auto-tune without actual auto-tune...
Охуенно!
The Vengaboys would be proud
EVERY TIME WE TOUCH ❤ best part
Gals, I have found the medley of my childhood, and it is sang by my favorite acapella group and singers. Excuse me while I die in happy peace.
Ok but Everytime We Touch was released in 2006?
Believe by Cher >
Now I need a full version of Every time we touch
Love it!!
Really enjoyed this🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍
Mitch's high notes never failed to amaze us!  And I'm living into it haha, love you all.   Thank you PENTATONIX for making my day feels more better everytime I listen to your songs and covers.
So. Much. Happiness watching this! Cannot believe some of these songs are 90's. I is OLD. LOL
I searched for "perfect" and i wasn't surprised that this was in the results.
Their voices are better than the OG songs
Well done guys 👌👍love it
The autotune ruined this, its terrible
Meanwhile in the comments: 90s kids/teens/adults: WE WANT THE FULL VERSIONS OF BELIEVE and BLUE because they're AWESOME!! youngsters: ew ew vocal effects.   LOL I can't. Go listen to the originals. We can't imagine Cher and Eiffel 65's hits without those effects, they're trademarks of those songs! :)
Tengo un serio trauma con Mitch, lo amo demasiado ✨❤️🥺
This was awesome. The only thing that bugged me was at 3:11 it didnt flow like the rest of the video.
Love love love!!!!!
They really should have let Mitch sing Cascada 😭
Congratulations,is very,very good.
Every single production is just flawless, but this, this stirred some deep memories! Brilliant!
I see you replaced some members...
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I want to hear this live. Feels a bit overproduced to me idk, hope I’m wrong.
The bad and sad thing is that this medley ends 🥺🥺🥺🖤🖤
OMG! This transports me right back to clubbing in my youth! <3
Lit🔥🔥 are we allowed to have a list of these songs??
I would totally buy this album 💯
Queremos as músicas na íntegra, pelo amor de Deus hahahhaaa... we want the songs in full, pleas
Scott's sunglasses are killing me.
Kirstin with curls is now "Kurlstin"
ROAD TO 1M !!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👍🥰
The songs of my teen years and early 20's..
Interesting but all we get of Ace of Base is 7 seconds of "Beautiful Life?"
Those songs from 90s uwu, we use those songs in our commercial so we hear them all the time, hahhahahahahahahahahaha Philippines folks where you at? That Finally got me...
When they were on the sing off for guilty pleasures week they were going to sing believe by Cher but the arrangement was off. So they switched to video killed the radio star in honor of Sonos.  I’m so glad they added believe to the 90 mix.
I need to add this to every playlist possible - where can i get this!?!?
Super
Sempre arrasando
I need the 'tude that Scotty is exhuding with the glasses on at all times. I'm LIVING
Not even one song by Madonna, how come? Aren't we talking about 90s?
This is a master piece!!😍😍 thank you🤩🤩
Please do an 80s version!!!
Will this be on Spotify? I need it asap!
kinda crazy that I've been following ptx for 7 years now, so grateful to have discovered them
Шикарно!!! Супер!!
It took me 2 seconds to make me smile.
Scott's voice always makes me feel some type of way...Oh my goooodness!😘
Is Cascada's version of "Everytime We Touch" a cover?
Omg love, LOVE every moment of this! While I was watching I was saying in head, please do Cece Peniston...and they did!
My feels! I miss this kind of music (90's boi here)
I love their songs and content 😍 but I feel like the transitions from song to song were pretty abrupt and kinda just I don’t know they didn’t flow into each other like the other medley arrangements they’ve done 😅 also I know it was an artist choice to go with the era and genre but the auto tune/effects sound weird with a acappella music idk
This autotune tho…frickin’ noice👌🏾
Esto es simplemente increíble 😍❤️❤️
I suspected my husband always texting a lady on his phone , We’ve been married for 18 years, we’ve both been happy together until recently when he switched side  and I found out he has been cheating .I explained my story to a colleague at work then she introduced me to this genuine hacker, ultimate hack  who gave me access to his phone , I had complete access to his phone right on my own device and I could see all  his activities for the past 2 years and also have access to new notifications, his text messages, Facebook messages,location, call logs, and I found out my husband has been flirting on dating sites..I love my husband a lot and I still don’t understand why he betrayed me, I have been a good hardworking wife and never for once cheated on him, tracked him down and found out he was always going to sleep in another woman’s house with me thinking my husband is always at work for night shift. You can contact this great hacker who helped me found out the truth about my husband at ultimatehack003(at)gmail com or Whats app +17202954268 or text and call them directly on the same number. They helped me get access into his phone without even touching his phone.I have enough evidence against my husband and I am thinking of Filing for divorce
Beautifully and perfectly made. Amazing!
I would like, no, I need a full version of Believe
I'm always amazed by Mitch.  I was a little off put by Kirstin in this video. Felt like "sex sells" vibe with a frozen face, which I don't expect from her. Usually she has more of a "talent sells" vibe. Great tune either way. Love to see this group still going strong!
Awesome 👏🏻!
WE NEED CHER BELIEVE FULL VERSION PLEASE.........
WOW 6 lol
2:55,  my favourite part is how the sing the Eiffel 65 Blue.
Another Grammy award...
No rhythm of the night 🥺
This is so good!!!
That was FANTASTIC!  Thank you, PTX, for that incredible trip back in time.  Now, two suggestions:  1.)  A tribute to Cher where she joins in.  2.)  A tribute to Annie Lennox/The Eurythmics where they join in.  :D  PLEASE!!!!!  :D
You guys leave me speechless!!!!  So gifted!
They need to cover all of these songs and make a 90's album!!
can we get a full cover of everytime we touch plz????????????????
Am I the only one thinking that Scott got hotter with every costume change?
Amazing love this! ❤❤❤❤❤
0:05   0:52   4:45 My favourite parts
マジでレベチのカッコ良さだよ。あとはミッチのメロディライン綺麗すぎる。大好き
In time for sefira
Giving me highschool flashbacks!
it might sound ungrateful for this amazing medley, but it's sad that Push The Feeling On, Another Night, Barbie Girl, or Gypsy Woman were absent :(
I am not even the age demographic for this group, but I get so excited when alerted they have posted! I love these mashups. Kirstin Maldonado is giving me some hard old Jenny-from-the-block vibes. lol. In Living Color! Keep it coming PTX!
This song is not available in Spotify yet? 👀
yesss.. they did that, like there was only one song that I didn't know.  also when they did Gypsy woman, I got flashbacks to when Kim Wayans did that parody on In Livin' Color 😂
It's cool! so great!!!
10 years after not doing "Believe" in the Sing-off, here it is 💚
Dancing and singing in my bed like crazy for 5 minutes JAJAJAJA I just love you 😍 ahhh Venezuela 🇻🇪 arribaaaaa
omg. they did Alice Deejay! made me feel young again!  My techno days lol!
My fav acapella grup in the world
Ahhh no Quad City DJs
This is amazing and also basically the soundtrack of Night at the Roxbury
So they were able to finally do (at least part of) Cher's "Believe", huh?  Only took 10 years. :)
I absolutely love this. This is so good 🔥
Philippine commercials ruined “Finally” for me cuz all I heard was, “Finally, Ariel happened to me—“
Great job
Mitch’s high notes gave me the shiveeersss
I love every second of this 🤗❤️
absolutely *_living_* for the fits
<333 kirstine is so gorg <3
Man, every one of these songs was fire back in the day
I definitely forgot about that Sonique  song.
Wow, I forgot how much I loved all of these songs ❤️
Excelso
Good times!
♥️🤩👏👌
Music now sucks. The 90s were a better time.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
All of their voices just continue to get better with time. So much talent.
Amazing . Also I didn’t know Cascadas Everytime we touch came out in the 90’s I thought early 2000 like 2012 because it was really popular when I was in middle school
<3
Ah, the memories.
I screamed inside with excitement to hear Everytime We Touch!!!
Someone pls do a playlist in Spotify with this songs 😭✨❤️ OMG is so good
Wish there was an album of just this!!!’
最高ー！かっこいい！
Tem alguma coisa que eles façam que não fique bom? ❤️
This was straight FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if txt  and  ptx are going to collaborate  on  a  song because one of the members loves pentatonix can't sleep love
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
OBSESSED!!!!!!!!
I would love to hear a full cover of It Feels So Good, by Sonique! Such a killer song!
I see you Mitch, channeling your inner George Michael with that look!
How i miss that time!!! The music was sooooo good!
OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING!!!
when are you going to release an album of ALL your medleys i know for a fact all the pentaholix you adore it love you all so much
Thank you for this. It brought back so many memories.
IT's amazing!!!! I love it 😍😍😍😍
I MISSED YALL 😭😭😭💖💖💖
I shared this with my 17 year old daughter and she loved it.    Who did you share this video with?
I know you guys usually do upbeat stuff but maybe time to do 90s ballads - and then you can make a little nod to Ben Folds cuz that would be fun.  Here's for all of you who have no idea what I'm talking about:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt5EHAqhR1c
*drive at 5 streetmix with DJ Danny D on Z103 intensifies*
I´m sorry... But 90% is studio magic.
WOW! I’m sure I’m not the only one that can’t believe this was totally a cappella. They just continue to amaze me. They just keep getting better and better!
Matt singing Cher yassss 👏 👏 this was one of my favorite medleys you all have done !! Always amazed by your hard work!
Got goosebumps with this magnificent medley, love it, I want a 90's theme party and dance with this music
I just want full versions of all of these LOL xD <3
omg her voice at "every time we touch"
I need a full version of Every Time Wet Touch in my life!
I want every song as a single song now ❤️
I was born in the 80s and grew up with all these. What overwhelming happy nostalgia!! Best medley ever. Can’t stop listening, singing, dancing and having mega flashbacks!! Totally agree that we need them all as separate covers. Everyone smashed it here. Just amazing. Thank you, just thank you...
The guys are cool, of course, but they obviously couldn't do without a synthesizer and audio editing.
Cascada's Everytime We Touch isn't from the 90s though? lol
Oh My God!!! This is my new favorite medley of yours!!!
🖤🇲🇽

Mitch is giving me Balthazar Bratt from Despicable Me 3 vibes with this look😂
Having been a teen in the 90’s 😂 This was like a happy memory overload. Amazing job, this was literally an awesome step back, to a time in my life that was pure freedom.
I never knew I needed this until I heard it. So many songs from my formative years.   Would love to hear you guys take on Silence by Delerium.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AUTO-TUNE?
all the songs i literally grew up listening to 😭😭
They all sing the songs so well!! But I feel like the songs are all so different so the transitions aren't so smooth, but still enjoyable!
i was in my late teens and 20's in the 90's and i remember 95% of these songs  they weren't the best of the 90's but i love almost anything ptx does but its not very exciting,  so many janet jackson and the like songs to do and you chose the one hit wonders  maybe that would have been a better title.  one hit wonders of the 90's.  :)
Czad!
iM OBSESSED WITH THIS.
3rd grade jams - "I'm blue da be dee, da ba duh!"
This... this warms my heart. PTX flaunting their songs, proving they can LITERALLY sing everything!
que vaina tan arrecha......  impresionante
What's with the pedostash?
Pentatonix 🌈 you’ve, imho, mastered the perfect arrangement & choice of 90’s songs 💋💋 sooo good 💋 Thank You!
Awesome ! But it would have been a lot better without that much auto-tune or without it at all. It ruins your talent.
They always knock me off my chair with this outta of this world talent
I love this... but at the same time it makes me feel so OLD.
Where can you buy their music for download, if I want to play it from my own nas server connected to my sound system at home. It doesn't look like that's possible from Amazon..
And they DID IT AGAIN!
THE VIBES ARE IMMACULATE
Flash Flash Flash terrible video
M. Grassy i like your voiceee
I love the 90’s
Now that was a nostalgia trip
❤️🥰
🧀
3 notes in: Me: OMG YASS!
BLM Co-Founder Buys $1.4 Million Home in Affluent Topanga, Where Less Than 2% of Population Is Black
Wonderful
Ohhhhhhh the Nostalgia all in one video!!!... Sorry Replay Button.. i'm about to break you! <3
Love this. There are so many other good 90s dance songs can we get a part two?  Sweet Dreams - La Bouche Come on ride the Train - Quad City DJs My Boo -Ghosttown DJs  Love you down - Inoj are some I’d love to hear
All these artists are now afraid of PTX because this is on fire and outta this world! ❤❤❤❤❤
I just need to remind everyone that all the auto-tune/effects are actually there voices and not added in post.
Scott in the yellow suit looks like he's from gta
Thank you for the trip down memory lane
MEU PENTATONIX TA VIVOOOOOO
nooo que temones. son les unes ♥
I hate to say and please keep in my mind that this is my opinion but they have not been the same since Avi left. I’ve been very disappointed with their sound.
<3
Love it :-)  More 90:s PLEASE :-)
omg i love the versatility of this group, i have been a big fan of this group for quite some time, like i remember when they went on their big tour that was also a documentary i think... (it was a while ago) ive seen them change and evolve and progress, they are so talented! love you Pentatonix!
This goes so hard
😍😍😍❤thank you.
when i saw that believe by Cher was on the list I just knew it had to be Mitch to sing thz climax
that was a trip back in time.
My favority
God, the transitions in this are flawless.   Also, I'm in love with Kirsty's hair and Matt's blue-checker jacket. I couldn't pull off the hair but I want that jacket.
u are greate!
I didn't know romulans could sing?
Am i the only one who found each transition to be SUPER awkward and sloppy? They did a really good job with each individual song but it didn't flow right AT ALL.
As a 00's kid, let's see how many songs I'll recognize
if you liked this check out the originals, too!!!!
The best tracklist ever!! You surprise me every time. I love you!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🇲🇽
Can we talk about how beautiful Mitch's smile is?
NO  I want You" by Savage Garden though... A-
INCREIBLES LOS AMO
Why some of these men act like women. Especially guy with mustache? Can someone tell who are they?
Massa véi!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I stan Scott in that yellow suit and the glasses
I can not stop listening to it! Sooooooo good!
we need a full version of Believe by Cher
WONDERFUL....🥰❤
This is basically my dads playlist
I would seriously buy a 90s album if they'd just straight up rerecord the hits
1) OMGOODNESS YES 2021! 2) Cascada isn't 90s but I love her.
Perfect
🔴 You will like and share this video because it's awesome!
An full version of ‘Everytime We Touch’  would be AWSOME!! (2:14)
its clear that kirstie has quickly gone from my favorite ptx member to my favorite ptx member who is also an absolute bicon and i’m here for it also i need a full version of every time we touch 😂
Thank you Pentatonix ❤️ from all of us
This gives me early YouTube vibes love it
0:37 Руки вверх Песенка.
Who else has just been jamming to this for a whole day already
LOVE this!!!
Wow! Haven’t heard some of these since the 90s.
Can you guys believe these songs are over 20 years old and some nearly 30? Like damn I’m old.
Y'all Are AMAZING!!! My Whole Family loves each of you... AMAZING :)
I need a full version of "Believe!" So good!
309 people are too young to remember these, and don't understand the weird outfits.
OMG I LOVE THIS!!! Is this on their new album? Where can I buy it?
Coming from a choir kid, they hit EVERY beat, that defined my life as a kid, I used to listen to these songs on the radio, and learned to love EDM as a result. Pretty sure I still have that Eiffel 65 album chillin somewhere.
Oh man it made me go back to my childhood!!!!
Mitch is really a masterpiece, besides being beautiful, he has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard
2 seconds in and I already love it!!
Воу-воу! Разрыв, такая ностальгия)))
Matt's blue jacket is fly. This medley makes me want to go roller skating
Wooooow The Very Best     Thanks  Pentatonix ;-)
This is amazing
I literally could not stop smiling through this  it was hit after hit and it was absolutely amazing love this so much you just wow great work as always Pentatonix. Almost forgot who ever did the outfits completely nailed on point 10s a cross the boards you guys body this!!!

I miss the live covers. No effects or lip-syncing the pre-record, just their voices.
Oh my God! This is my childhood😍❤☺️👏⭐
LOVE THIS! I've seen you 3 times with the kiddos, can't wait for #4. ❤️🤘
A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. !!! Now lets cover all these songs guys! Do an album! PLEASE !!!
who needs a synthesizer if you got a mitch
My son (who is 7) LOVES you guys and cant help but beatbox along to you. He's getting pretty good too!
Fantastic!! No The Rhythm of the Night by Corona though?
Lame
It's not really acapella if youre synthesizing the audio.
I'd die for a full cover of Sonique's It Feels So Good!
Euro dance
Dude in the black that sings like a girl has the most dirty Sanchez mustache I ever seent lol
I was sad they used auto tune because their voices are so good without it but i love pentatonix and i liked the vidio
Какие же вы молодцы! Спасибо!!!
We deserve an extended version of this, an hour at the least. Thank you for giving eurodance some love.
Ughh y’all are amazing!!!!
Question,- Why are you guys so amazing? :) :)
That just brought back memories of my 20s, dancing and flirting. Ah, to be young.
This is absolutely amazing! Love it!
2:42 Just my personal replay button for Kirstie’s part :)
This is what 2021 needed!
O MY GOD😲😍
This is so good!! I love it!!
Waiting for tonight is litterally on POINT!!!!
Shame, PTX used to be about a capella, now it's about autotune
Ok, Scott looks sick with this glassses 👓
This is GOLD! ... for me as a 90's kid, thats the perfect compilation <3 Greetings from germany
Vocês são muito bom sério 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 gosto muito de vê vocês cantar
YES! The Daft Punk-medley is hard to beat, but this comes pretty darn close!
Muito bem
Oh can you do "re-sing" the awesome Grease Songs? ❤️❤️
Been away from pentatonix for a long time. what happened to other secondary bass/beat boxer? the new one is great, just curious.
Love that Blue part <3 But the whole mix is fire. x
Damn so sick. Everything on point. Plus whoever edited this has mad skills.
The best years of my 💙💙💙
Ben yaradan tarafından tüm insanlığa gönderilen yaradanın elçisi kıyametin habercisiyim vede dünyadaki hiç bir dine ait değilim eğer insanoğlu zalimliğine devam ederse 2028 de yok olacak
I loooove it ❤️❤️❤️ I love all songs but this is the best because that are the best songs from my youth 🤣 I am so old 😂
U still amazing me.  I love you guys all of u are amazing in your own right and together well it's phenomenal.  Hope to have the pleasure to see u in person and sing with u
Mitch is not human, wow
I knew every song 🥰😍
They are all so pretty! I love to look at them and marvel at their talent. I could swear there's electonic instruments! At least on the vocals like electric echo or whatever.
Plot twist: They are all wearing sweatpants
At the “Everybody dance now”, Kevin got the beat perfect, almost unbelievable 🔥
This is amazing!
We need a full studio version of Wanna Be My Lover. This was FANTASTIC!
Ugh! 5:44 of pure happiness! 😍😍😍
Kirsten is stunning, she's radiant, it's crazy.
When is this one coming to Spotify?  Can't wait to add it to my 90's dance playlist!
90 were the best come on 90 kids
Back to the roods. I love it.
Incredible. Isn't 90's the era of voice effects revolution?
KIRSTEN IS SO BEAUTIFUL THERE I SAID IT THEY ALL ARE
Some of my favorite 90s songs. Great!
Kirstens hair looks so cool
ahhh im in love😍
I can say only one word- "awersome".I enjoyed every moment of your performance,guys.You could make this poppury very exciting,unforgetable and so special.Well done!I adore you and your music.Best wishes,Marina S.(your fan from Russia)
very nice the nineties i love it :-)  ... perfect mix
1:52 is INSANE!! PTX you never EVER fail to amaze !!!!!!!
EVERY TIME WE TOUCH CAME OUT IN 2006
I never wanted that to end.
I want a full version of "Every time we touch" CUZ IT WAS SO DAMM GOOD
Pure nostalgia 😌
This is genuinely so bad
Need a full Vengaboys medley!
I love it
This needs a reaction any vocal coach out there?
One major complaint - why did it end? It was soooo good and there are so many songs that could have been added. Hoping there is a part 2, 3, 4, 5.....
This has brought back so many memories!! 90's music was amazing
Did oh girl get her lips done 👀ok go head den n upgrade
🤯🤯
4:46 If only our dog barks like this I would not tell him to shut up
👍👍👍
Pentatonix. Lol I forgot that about that group since Pitch Perfect came out lmaoooo
Proud 90s kid here!! 👋🏼😍😍
Literal chills. Omg I love this❤️❤️❤️
Fell in love with Pentatonix all over again.  This is perfection.
Wooooohoooouuu! Perfect!!
Jeez, this quintet is still killin' it with these covers. I hope they're all doing well, during this craziness.  Also, I only know that "boom boom boom boom" song from Game Grumps, because I'm a freaking plebian. 😅
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you! Never give up on your life!
excellent brought back some memories xx
People who disliked this video held their phone upside down 🙃
This 90’s mix is awesome. I need it on repeat and replay forever!!!!!
Wow, this is pure🔥 And I've never followed their music, I've heard of 'em. I will now though😉
Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  and “SHOW ME LOVE” and “FINALLY” too???? Yes 😭😭💚💚💚💚💚💚
Obergeil !!! ))
This is so much fun to watch. Love love love it.
Amazing!! 🙌🏻🔥🔥
eeee? 90-s!!! Thanks, PTX!!! Waiting for "Believe" full version
I was slammed back to my high school days!  Thanks for this birthday gift, Pentatonix!
Absolutely incredible
I'd like a full version of every single one of these songs!
Now I need a full version of Believe !!!!!
I love that autotune :))
Perrrrrrrrrrfecttttt
Wow 👏👏👏👏👏👏❤
The amount of outfits in this video
Fyi, if you didn't already know,  Jennifer Lopez - Waiting for Tonight  Is a cover of the original: 3rd Party - Waiting for Tonight
Love this
this people keep making "music"?! jesus
Another. Five. Mics. Dropped. 💯🔥💥🔥💥
Can I just say that..from 2:55 till 2:58..I literally couldn't keep my eyes off of Scott because he just looks sO FREAKING GOOD
The beatboxing is absolutely insane. Exactly like I remember the songs.
Oh man, this is just awesome and so much fun. I´ve been dancing all day. But the best thing about it is seeing Mitch happy again.
we truly need a full version of Believe
I love it
me over here liking every comment
I knew there would be some Ace of Base, my best friend's favorite band in the 90s, so I was listening for it. 5 second chorus if It's A Beautiful Life. XD
I love kirstins hair!!
Thank you for making my life better 🖤🖤🖤
I’m Blue took me right back to the elementary school dance. I’m 32 years old now. I fucking hate getting old!
Fun mix!  You always sound so good!
カースティンがとても可愛い💕
So amazing!!! I friggin loved it!
Their singing as always is top tier, as in nobody does it better, but can we talk about Matt's Black and Blue check jacket? Amazing!
Fabulous!
i fucking love mitch yall dont get it
Omg 😭😭 I want full versions of everything.. I would listen to an album of this every day in the gym
LA BOUCHE!
I am LIVING for Kirstin's hair! 😍😍 Also, petition for a full cover of "Everything we Touch!" 🥰😍
Lindo
This was amazing!!!
I still remember when these songs were brand new! How fast time goes!
Love the LaBouche start. WOW Mitch pitch perfect!
OMG Guys! You took me back to high school, to the parties! Thanks!
WOW, what great fun. And, can we talk about costumes. They have an uncanny ability to choose what looks so great and fun in time with the music. LOVE THIS!!
Okaaaay! After this, we're gonna need full versions of these songs. Imagine a PTX 90's cover album 😍
s Lot of Eurodance!❤ I was born in 90s so it's my childhood jams.
Love it!!! Please do an every decade medley as an album!!!
Haven't listened to them in way too long. It's great to be back!
My Favorite song is Every time We Touch and I hope PTX will be cover this song🙏🏻🙏🏻 form thailand🇹🇭🇹🇭
Omg feels like I’m reliving my childhood again!! ❤️ Esp at boom boom boom!   By the way, did they used autotune in some parts? Eg Kristin at 4.17 and Mitch at 4.33. (I don’t have anything against them using autotune though. I’m just curious if it was autotune or they could somehow make their voice sound robotic!)
This is amazing.  What is also amazing is how Kirsten can pull off absolutely any hairstyle and color.
I wish they would make a full version of "Everytime We Touch".....
Europeans have been found wigless
I feel so old, because I know them all and I am barely 23 years old.
Que top mano ficou muito da hora, amo as músicas dos anos 90 ❤💖😁
omfg that whole cher section was insaaaaane
Grazie molto allegro questo video mi ha portato indietro agli anni 80/90 quando ero una ragazza
I thought there's a problem with my phone or the signal. LOL You got me PTX.
Cringy
J-pop medley please
🤸‍♀️❤️
OH MY GOD GUYS YOU ARE AMAZING....IT IS SO NOSTALGIIC!
💕
6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither [are] your ways my ways, saith the LORD. (Isaiah 55:6, KJV)
OMG 🤩. SUPER
Super fun mix! Amped me up and I had a great time adding all these songs to my playlist
The world is a much better place with Pentatonix!
⭐⭐⭐⭐👍😍👏👏
AMAZZINNNGGGGGGGG
is it on spotify?
I’d pay for this entire album if it was a thing
Yasss.. another medley compilation.. ❤️
Is on this earth any song that PTX cannot cover in brilliant way?? LOVE THIS <3
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. The hardness of butter is directly proportional to the softness of the bread. 2. The last thing on earth you want to do will be the last thing you do. 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of "Smart"? 5. He who laughs last thinks slowest. 6. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 7. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 8.  Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time. 9. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries. 10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.  Editorial:Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
I love you pentatonix! I listen to your Christmas music into February 😆
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
Please do all these songs as full songs not a medley. That would be AWESOME.
Bring back avi
wasn't there whole thing to be acapella?
Ready to buy the CD.
Is this song available on Spotify?
This is now one of my favorites ❤
Best music 🎧🎧🎧👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Why dont you guys try to cover the song of La Bouche (Be My Lover) i think its perfect when you guys sing it.
Kirsten with the Hilary Banks hair-do, yeah that's 90's xD
😍😍😍😍😍
Amazing!!!
Why isnt this on Spitify. My childhood was Boom Boom Boom
Это просто великолепно!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🎶👁️👃👁️🎵
Everytime we touch and waiting for tonight was early 2000s but who cares
Blueのとこで照明も青くなるの好き
Brilliant as usual. What a super group with brilliant film editing. Harmonies so tight and everybodys solos fantastic. Genius beatboxing. Go the Pentatonix. You really are a super group.
Love them all 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
can we talk about kirstin NAILING JLO😳😳
no one: me: *having **0:13** to **0:19** playing on loop bc its so fucking catchy*
I didn't know how much I needed this.
Mitch was amazing and 90s songs were made for his range. That said, I feel Matt was underutilized. Kevin rocked it as always also.
Thanks for the trip down memory lane! xo
best songs ever! thank you guys for this one!
This is awesome!!! Do more please!!!
Vengaboys, awesome!
Would love to see PTX do a medley of Celine Dion songs.
I could just a full cover of every time we touch by ptx :)
Наткнулся на ОДНОГО чела, ТРЕКИ БОМБА, ПРОСТО САМИ послушай https://youtu.be/cnCDw0hnQMs
As much as we love about kevin,don't forget how cool Matt when he's singing,hehehe

I hope in their 10-year anniversary, they’re gonna cover Change on the Rise with Avi. 😭
Amazing, who else wants full versions of some of these?
Wow!!! Mitch is adorable 😘😘😘
Lots of great chunks but I would rather have had an album with full versions of each song.
Omg, i’m young again ❤️❤️❤️
Are they going to do a full version of each song?
You are incredible!!! Mitch hoy are fantastic in this video!!!!
OMG, I really love it. Love all the songs. Best song of PTX song for me.
Oh. Memories. Thank You guys. Perfect job
My Dàrlings😍😍😍😍😍 And Oh Mitch Grassi🔥🔥
heyy
Vocals are amazing as usual Mitch!
I was waiting for In a Dream by Rockell but  it's  cool 😎😌
Dance medley but make it sound angelic 🤍😭 Only Pentatonix can do that 👏👏👏
Matt is always smiling. I love it 😀
I would go absolutely nuts for an entire album of these covers. Plsssssss Pentatonix ❤️❤️❤️
You have to bring out a full version of all these songs!! This is SO good!!! ☺
<blue・エッフェル65> <beautiful life・ace of bace> 格好いい❤️
I’m glad the girl finally gets to shine instead of being pushed behind for the 2 guys to sing more of the songs
The Nostalgia!!
1000 лайков поставила бы, если бы могла. Я вас люблю, ребята! Вы очень классные)
OMG, Back to back 90's songs so love it! 😍 My Ptx artists xoxo
Super!
0:52 is so _good_ and then when scott adds the harmony... 🤩
🔥🔥🔥
Pls make the full cover for the it feels so good
❤️Excellent 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Mitch you're so awesome, the whole group is mind blowing
Mitch you're so awesome, the whole group is mind blowing
Is it too much to ask for an album? You brought back my childhood! 💜💜💜 And covered 2 of my favorite songs!
Congrats kevin
❤❤❤❤
They stole this from the Danish acapella vocal group Local Vocal
Matt’s Cher solo!!!! 😍
I feel like I'm a kid again! 😍 So many great songs! 😍😍
This feels like back in the day the late night infomercials selling CD collections and they would play a snippet of dance songs to entice you to buy. I love it!!!!
Cascada ain’t 90s tho
You guys should do a Mariah Carey medley next. She’s got plenty of hits for you guys to choose from!
So good
Yassss!!! I'm here for this <3 90's and early 2000's are my jams <3 <3 I just listened 3 times dancing around my office <3
Me encantan los encuentro fantasticos
Mitch sounds like a soprano. As a high soprano I am impressed.
So good
A moment of silence in respect for the CURLS. Lady K killing her look as usual. But don't they all?     I see my entire Spring wardrobe in here.
Love you guys but I hate that I can't download your songs yet I can't stay mad at you
Definitivamente Wuao!!!! 💗😍😍😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💞💞💞👌👌👌👌👌👌
KO 😱❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
PETITION FOR PENTATONIX TO DO MORE MEDLEYS FROM OTHER DECADES.. 80s, 70s, 60s, 00s or even 2010s.. IT'S SUCH AN EAR-CANDY TREAT..
Incredible
1:13 Was that a squirrel in his pocket, or is his range just that high?  😲
Box changes are actually like 90s .....trippy as hell
Wish Kevin and Matt got more than one line a song. I guess I should just be happy Scott let anybody actually sing instead of just being his backup.
Seriously been waiting for a 90’s Medley forever! Thank you so much PTX we love youuuuuu
パズドラのCMからお世話になっております
do the leave the door open
Perfect
I feel like go back to the days when I was a college boy 😁👍👍
Mega Mega, this is the way I like PTX, I can't wait to listen live in Germany to all of you, I hope it will happen in the future, thank you and all the best!!! Take care!
I love it 😊
Love this 90s medley, I'm a 90s babe myself so I rememberd al the songs,  I loved it ;)
Scott needs to ease up onthe hair gel, because he looks so much better here when it doesn't look so rigid!
I have watched this like 200 times. This is amazing!
❤❤❤
Fun fact: they were supposed to perform “Believe” on the Sing Off (for one of the challenges), but at the last minute they cut it and replaced it with “Video Killed The Radio Star”. So glad I got to hear Cher in this medley finally! #fullcircle
Still struggling to believe there are no instruments 🤯
A song a long?!?- Lars Ericksson
Waouh 😃 j adore ❤️ merci à vous , c'est joyeux , magnifique  au top comme toujours 🙏
Это фантастика, молодцы ребята. Всегда радуют!!!!
Superbly stonkin 💖💖💖
Круто, молодцы!!!
RIGHT in the childhood!
Love it 😍🤩
メドレーって見入ってしまうねｗ
Is magnificent!
Probably the best mashup i've ever listened to (so many incredible songs wow).
SO GOOD ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
𝘿𝙤𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙮𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨 𝘼𝙫𝙞?😪
Perfect timing for Sefira
Damn mitch
Waiting For Tonight 🔥🔥
💛👌
Hate that sound of auto tune. Miss the days of them just standing around a mic with fairly raw audio. Proud of how far they’ve come tho.
Adoroooo repertório de músicas dance dos anos 90 👍.... Quem tb curte deixa seu ❤️ aqui
WOW! Full cover of Believe PLEASE!
I need this on Spotify ASAP 🤩
WoW! 'm thrilled!! 🤩🤩 p.s.: I want Scott's glasses! 😎😁
So which one is gay?
This is handwashing music
https://youtu.be/2PXYhpm_Av8
I need the Cher's Believe in full song right now!!!!
What happened with: Rhythm Of The Night? How about a part 2?
Scott, Mitch, Kirstie, Kevin, Matt, I have low voice, so I could be second bass man.
1:59 that harmonizing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾❤❤
I love all of them are having so much fun with these songs
勉強はかどる
This was EPIC!! Please do a 90's ballad medley 🤩
Love it, hope to see you guys again 👏👏😘😘
Always amazing.... Love them...💕 Keep bringing love, music and light to people through your style. Keep safe everyone.
Это великолепно, слов нет!!!
Flawless!!! Flawless!!! I love you guys!!!!!!
THATS HYPNOTIC!
Please put this on spotify its is so good
This is such a TreaT ❤️ Love love love itt ! I now feel like going to a 90's party 💛🎼💃🏽🕺🏼🤗💚
I love how they cant help but smile when doing some of the cheesy ones lol
Fun fun fun!!!  Love the outfits and the chosen songs were great.  Love PTX so much!
I miss the five of them simply sitting in front of the camera doing these medleys in one take with no vocal effects or layering. That being said, i loved this. So much nostalgia.
Love it! Although tbh they could have broken "dance" by each year of the 90s with some of the bangers from Europe and America at that time
Wooow 😍😍😍🔥
https://youtu.be/Jwgf3wmiA04
https://youtu.be/Jwgf3wmiA04
https://youtu.be/Jwgf3wmiA04
Thank you for appreciating 90's dance music. Amazing!
You all look fire in this!
now this is a throwback to the old ptx i grew up listening to <3
Wow.... that is great.. i love it...😍
I love your work, this is icredible
I like this Mix, Well selected and done
Call back to sing off with Cher there :)
Nostalgic
Thx! It's great how you reminded me Times of My Crazy Youth!
Full versions please ........ everytime we touch Better off alone Blue Boom boom boom What is love
In the 90s I was in Elementary School.  Here I am working as a Nurse in the real world 2021.  (@_@)
Pour une fois j'ai pu être là avant les 500k vues
Uauuuuu👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 🥳🇵🇹
Please do blackpink evolution or Blackpink songs cover🥺
lmao i feel old listening to this partly because i like it a lot more than music nowadays
Is no one going to talk about Scott's glasses?
💖💖💖💖💖
I need a full cover of all of these 😭
Yass!!trending guyss
SPOT ON! FANTASTIC
17 on trending yayyy
Just fantastic, loving this mix like my old tape remixes I used to do back in this decade
Très fort ! Comme d’habitude 👌🏾
When it starts off the Gay Just Hits You
I miss their medleyyy Pentaholics here since 2015 :)
Super, Super!!!!!
Cascada ist aber nicht 90er sondern 2000er
Got so hyped- just by seeing the notification🔥
Очень круто!!! 💖💖💖💖👍👍👍
Just amazaaaaaazing, big hug from Germany😘
this is great but why are they singing cascada on a 90s medley??
Everything we touch, and Blue it's So marvelous!!!
Question: How well known would you say these songs are in the U.S.? They’re all instantly recognisable Euro pop songs to anyone who was around in the 90’s, assumed they were only Euro pop though :P
I don't know why freddy mercury lookin dude annoys me but I think they tweek his audio. He has to be using autotune for one and secondly he is used for typically female vocal ranges which I wonder if his team mate ever gets salty over
E quando parte Blue degli Eiffel 65 si capisce che si sta parlando sul serio di anni '90 🥰
Amazing!!!!!
MEAT AND POTATOES
What's with the autotune and extra beats added in? This isn't Acapella anymore
I missed those medleys
Amazing
Loved it
❤❤❤
While I do like it, I feel like it‘s just one song after another, not so much the songs mixed in with each other like PTX has acheived before.
Beautiful
😍
Loooooooooove it!!!!!!!!
Totally love it! 🔥❤️
My childhood in 5 minutes and 44 seconds
shout out to the editor you killed it
Kirstie looks mesmerizing in her blonde curls and silver 😍😍😍😰😰 This medley was flawless and hypnotic
I love kirstin😍😍
Ciekawe jak by im wyszło "In the Jungle"
they make every fricking song better change my mind
Seriously need more like this, allot more 90's hits missing from this, hopefully part 2 in the works?
90's is my time
the most of the I know but while i hearing these songs mashup its was ASWOME ....HANDSOFF guys wonderful
I'm blue , If i was green  I will die. That's the Real lyrics  of the songs
Oh excellent! Brought big smile to my face :-D thank you so much :-*
Did they just pull off sounding like auto tune without actually auto tuning?  Anybody else, I'd be convinced they couldn't do it pure acapella, PTX, I have to ask.
Excellent medley. Cascada’s version of everytime we touch was released in 2006 doe the rock version is from the 90s
Why no Barbie Girl? 😜
Please make an album of 90's hits 😍😍
Whoever disliked this video is crazy not to love this video cause pentatonix is talented ❤️
Ayee
As soon as I heard “I’m blue” 😱💙
I loved we they sung believe by cher and they sung the song beautifully
日本人求ムーーーーーーーーー！ワンダフル〜〜〜〜〜〜〜！
Everytime we touch was released in 2006 tho? Lol
OMG, so nostalgic! And sooo well sung! 😍🖤🤟
Thank you for the Nostalgia 😎
You guys make me fly!!!!😍😍😍
So incredibly good😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
i never knew kristy had a tatoo
im bluE!
My clubbing days were in the late 90’s..... This is every song I love! Amazing!
ok can someone please tell me what Kirstin's collarbone tattoo says?  i paused it i still couldn't tell nor have i had any luck any other time i tried to tell what it says.   than you to someone who will say :)
Beautiful 😊😊
Did you guys steal the playlist from one of my middle school dances?
More Matt and Kevin singing too!!
ICONIC
なんかこういう撮り方久しぶりにみた。泣ける…
Great so comforting
This is so good, I’m loving the Sonique piece!!  Also - does the first song remind anyone of the X-Men cartoon series?
That longer break for Cascada  😂 Still needs a full cover
I love that I know all if these songs.
Kirstin is fire🔥. Looking and sounding exquisite as always but emphasis on the LOOKING😭💯🔥
Please correct me if I am wrong but Cascada - Everytime We Touch was released in early 2000s, right?
0:28 PERFECT VOICE 0:38 PERFECT EDIT 0:53 PERFECT HIGH TONE 1:31 STUNNING EVERYTHING
https://youtu.be/PhuIk3Cpnfk
I love itttt~ But, hear me out, I need the full cover of "Believe" in my life.
The way you guys kill it on these dance covers and mash-ups is just amazing. I am an old fart who has been doing A'capella for years, and I cannot even barely wrap my head around what you guys are doing with these dance numbers and mash-ups. That is ridiculous, fabulous! So enjoyed that! 😊
Wonderfully! My favorite 90's mix!
I have to say I am fascinated by Mitches modesty...everyone is so feeling themselves and I loooove it but Mitch just sits there singing incredible notes and being AWESOME. I love him so much. How come we deserve such a blessing
TOOOOP 🤣 U are the best 🥰🥰🥰
♡♡♡♡♡
Big fan of Scott's but Mitch's voice is sooooo perfect for this 90s melody.   Pentatonix rules!
Honestly I just can’t believe how well Kirsten looks with the short blonde curly hair!
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!! Bloody brilliant!! ❤️
I'm in love with you all 😍
I have watched this melody like 15 times but I don't care. It’s ICONIC
This is amazing and I loved it a lot as a kid who grew in the 90s, all the bangers haha... but, “Everytime We Touch” wasn’t a dance song in the 90s, the dance style cover by Cascada released in 2005 😅
OMG needed this so much! On repeat 24/7 🥰
Perfect! :D :)
I can totally see them perform this medley in concert! Can't wait!! Surprisingly I really like Kirstin's short hair. Compliments all around. Keep up the fantastic work!!
This is INSANE
🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃
YAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
Вы самые крутые!)
Skitbra
Excellent! 😍
Matt😍
2:56 that second when they turn blue, but dont start singing yet, but you know what song is coming next 🤟
かっこいい！！♥️
I love them. But honestly she needs to lay off the filler... her lips don’t even look even and she has no expression whatsoever ever. Lol
Of course their music was perfect!  But I find myself focusing more and more on what they are wearing.  All of them looked incredible!  However, Matt and Kevin were so sharp!  I loved Matt's blue/black jacket. I also find myself focusing more and more also on the interplay between Matt and Kevin's voices - those two guys seem to be vocally working together great on the past number of songs.  Of course we all know by now how awesome Kevin's talents are, but Matt is just blowing me away lately!  He is also so incredibly talented (as are all of them)!  I must have replayed Matt's closing low note about 10 times - no lie!
This makes me feel old
😏
Mlre medleys please...
БЛЯ этот трек просто бомба, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/cnCDw0hnQMs
I need a full version of  'It feels so good'!!!!!
I love dance music and I recognize almost all of these songs! I'm super impressed at the variety of dance artists Pentatonix did a cover for both mainstream artists and not so well known ones 🕺
Вы потрясающие!
4:02 Do you believe in life after love - it's a masterpiece. Want to hear full version.
I love how everyone is enjoying it, especially Matt. 💞
me no like the autotune. the beauty of the group was sounding great using just their voices but now its so heavily altered.
я шоке, что столь крутые треки бывают, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/cnCDw0hnQMs
One word... FIRE!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where's mmm bop???
i was in college in the 90s and these bring back fun fun times!! love matt opening cher's believe! mitch is divine as usual. love love love to all PTX!!
Love it! Please make a full Sonique - It feels so good cover! It feels sooooo goooood! 😁🤗

this medley is brilliant  .this is how these tracks should be sung .
Ohhhh I love it soo much 🥰
Божественно!
😍😍❤️
What happened to Mitch's face? O.O
I would pay money for a full version of Be My Lover.
Интересный факт для русских пентаголиков: это уже второй раз (edit благодаря поправке от Lina Malfoy - третий раз), когда Пентатоникс поют песню, до этого популярную в России, и написанную русскими авторами). Первым был их арранджмент "Танца Феи Драже" Чайковского, а второй... - "Песенка" группы Руки Вверх, которую впоследствии перекупили немцы ATC, перевели на английский и сделали мировым хитом в 99-м).
Incredibile🔥🔥🔥🔥🇮🇹
OH MY GOD!!!! This has made my heart so freaking happy!!! Love you Pentatonix, forever a fan!!
Although I was a teenager in mid to late 90s, I don't know most of these songs..
OMG YES! These songs all remind me of going out dancing back in the day.
I know it's the genre/decade .. but I just love it when there's minimal editting to their voices.
Вы классные👍
ptx never disappoints always delivers
Thank you! Just thank you 😊🙏
Mitch is crazyyyy for this
The BEST!!!! Они шикарны!!
Brilliant!
Great stuff
Where can I download this 90s dance medley? I totally see myself running and jogging to this ??
Can we talk about Matt that bass and his Solo 🔥🔥🔥
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
wow, i'm old
This video was 10/10... only thing that could make it 11/10 was if they added the “heeeeyyyyyy” at the end of the video.  If you know you know
Absolute Magik! They need to do a full version of the Everytime we touch song, It gave me goosebumps!
Ahhh the nostalgia feels❤️❤️
Damn that took me back. Thx PTX
With out a doubt  my absolute favorite PTX Mashup.
Cascada amazing , please  full version
Another great medley ! I Love Pentatonix
Lmao They really hyped this up like it was going to get 10M views day on day 1
Tis brings back memories tkn u for also including JLo 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏💖💖💖🥂🥂
I am a 90's kid and this brings me back to the childhood 🥰 😊
Ahhh so much nostalgia!!!
ONE OF THE BEST MEDLEY
Weird how nobody's commenting on 4:02 being the single best part in the entire awesome video? He sounds sooooooo good.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
best thing in 2021....
Perfect 👏👏👏💗💗💗
HOW !??!? this is Amazing , they sound so good ! Really one of my favorites already , they did a great job here
"Heeeyyyy!!" I miss the outros lol
You are amazing! I dream to visit your concert!
<3 <3
I want request to yours 80s music!
Прекрасное исполнение. Когда приедите в Россию
Sorry they are great but I just didn't like this one.
Better off alone + Sonique :tears for my high school days this is more a 90s/early 2000s mix
oh my god this is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD this girl from '86 is VERY GRATEFUL!!!!! man, '90s really had the most killer dance tracks.
WOAH ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
Dis shyt hits hard !!!
Just amazing!!!
🙌🏻👏🏻😁🤩✨🎶👌🏻
Imagine how many songs they could sing in a row and make it natural because they’ve done so many and are SO DANG GOOOOODDD!😍
Oh the memories!
Все очень круто! но автотюна бы поменьше все-таки, а то сильно выделяется
Make it an album already !!!!!
EURO DANCE MUSIC is so good!!!
Ooo matt with the sliding down low bass note at the end
Adorei🤗
Magnificent
PTX delivers always ❤️❤️
Made me feel like a kid again... thank you PTX
AAAH ME ENCANTAA
Mitch... The moustache... NO
I really love their looks and outfits!
Diva Kirstin!
30 seconds in, I already like it.
im expecting holy nostalgia and i doubt ill be disappointed
LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!  but ... not all the songs are from the 90s ... Everytime We Touch is 2005
Can we made it goes to trending? Its awesome;
I'm not thrilled with this "choice" of songs. Not fond of it in general  BUT again, despite the choice of songs,  Pentatonic always does a great job!!  I just wish they'd stick with songs that really spk. of "them" & that really amplified the uniqueness that they bring to the music world.
it's perfect!
Then i miss my era....
Strong stuff guys, I do have one question...the Autotune was obviously intentional throughout, usually they don't use this, was this simply put in to mock the 90s singers or for nostalgia purposes? I would like to hear the unfiltered version.
YAY! PTX has made on top Trending, they deserved it so much ^^
The best!
Amazing medley!
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Кайф! Лучше чем оригиналы❤️
The entire middle section I’m JAMMING!!!
Too many effects... I understand why they had to do it, but... frankly it ruins the acapella appeal.
衣装が素敵だぁ
definitely gonna let my mama hear this😁
This is the single greatest mix of songs in the history of mixes. It’s been on repeat for me. I’ve been dancing a lot today.
This is awesome! Love your voices as always!
OMG! Friday nights with WERZ in the club and every school dance! You just captured my adolescence <3 Thank you, this is just wonderful *kisses*
Brings back memories. Beautiful work!
😳 wow they said and a Who
Scott with those glass is is a whole mood!
Omg this is my life
I definitely getting Toni Braxton vibes from Mitch.
Wow. Love it.
thank you! this was amazing!
0:37 Pure magic. Nope cancel that ALL of it is pure magic.
Pentatonix are the best
Holy sh$t! Blue was amazing!
The vibes×the music they produced×the outfit Ughhh so good❤️🎶
I'm so in love with this❤️🎶
I love it
Ugh love the song choices. Surprised to see a couple of them on there! Cascada isn't 90s either but we can let it slide
I'd love a full album of these songs.
talent beyond perfection...
Always amazing!
"Oh! What!? Wait! No! Yes! WOW!" - me the entire video! 💘 thanks for this AMAZING medley!!
Almost the entire soundtrack to Night at the Roxbury lol jk
Omg nostalgia. Im living for it
Let's just say it's awesome
0:37  Teclado lindinho 2009.  Linda homenagem ao Brasil
Just as I was thinking this medley needs some Vengaboys or Aqua, _Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!_ started up.
This is a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The beginning, the harmonies, the leads, MITCH, the outfits, the HAIR, oh ma gawddddddd (love those gold curls)
Nice job PTX! While I am happy that you are putting out original music lately, your true strength is your creative power of re-imagining familiar favorites. As a musician of 30+ years, I am so inspired and in awe of the way in which you bring new life to otherwise semi-dusty music. Keep going! More please! Ohh... Random question. Why haven't you done any ABBA covers yet? That, and I would love to hear you re-invent The Manhattan Transfer's "The Boy From New York City." Love you all.....
OOOHHHH, you guys, I LOVE that section of Cher's "Believe"  WOW!!!  You really should do the complete cover of that song. Please, please, pretty pleeeeeease.
youve unlocked so many childhood memories :))))
Que coisa mais gostosa de ouvir. Delícia de som 😻🇧🇷
Umm this is my new favorite thing! I'm 27 and I know all of these! I cant wait to dance with my mom and JAM. I love it
OMG... I absolutely loved this! I think this is my favorite medley that you guys have done. :)
Man how'd yall do it? The damn harmonies are on point
2:55 Haters will say that voice is Edited.
OMFG ALL MY FAVE JAMS!
Literally, the first three minutes are the songs that always played late at night on the radio and kept me awake when I was a kid in the mid-90s. Missed a lot of sleep but it was worth it in retrospect.
LOVE THISSSS!!!!!
So good
So cool in my ear,🥰🥰
REPENT OF YOUR SINS  GOD IS REAL HEAVEN AND HELL IS REAL BUT YOU SHOULD WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN AND YOU CAN JUST ASK GOD TO FORGIVE YOU . ( THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KEEP ON DOING THAT SAME SIN JUST BECAUSE HE (GOD WILL FORGIVE YOU) OK THANKS FOR READING ✨✨✨✨TIME IS RUNNING OUT ⏳⏳⏰😁
Anyone else not recognize most of these songs?
Obsessed
Did they, somehow, fake auto-tune? Like: Did they just, really, pretend auto-tune?? WOW!
Remember when they were an accapella group?
Greetings from all fans in Russia!  We love you!  You are best!😘😍❤❤❤🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈💐
Can we just talk about Matt's bass?!? WOW
Amazing!!!
So Scott is wearing sunglasses inside, but does anyone remember Scott in one of the Superfruit videos saying that one of this pet peeves was when people wear sunglasses inside??? 😂
Loving Mitch’s stache
So good, I look forward to seeing you live someday!
Simply amazing Pentatonix! Awesome ☺️
Wooaahh... the nostalgia....
Perfección! ✨🔥🎶❤️
hohoho new medley to listen to❤️
Who else wishes they could buy this song off iTunes? 🙋🏼‍♀️
OH MY GOD THEY FINALLY DID BELIEVE i remember them talking about how they were gonna do it for guilty pleasure week for the sing off but couldn't settle on the arrangement....
You guys should do I will survive by Gloria gaynor. It would sound soooooo good
so good. Love it
okay, but Kirstie's hair is just too heckin cute
2:14 when i listen to this i almost scream, i love this song so much
Damn Mitch, so perfect. your voice is _gonna_ _make_ _me_ _sweat_
Would not surprise me at all if Kirsten and Mitch made those Auto-Tune flips naturally. Nope, would not be surprised not at all...
Now that's a cute hairdo Kirstin. So 90s.
Need a full version of Cher's Do you Believe in Love please.
Esto es tan increíble en tantos niveles 😱❤️🥰😍por Dios Mitch 🤤🤤🤤🥰❤️😍🇨🇴
i love Pentatonix. they have my favorite music! good job with your guys's music!
Excellent job. Keep them coming. You guys really knocked it out of the park. Kirstie absolutely beautiful, love your haircut ❤❤!! Kevin, Matt, Scott and Mitch ❤❤ as always sounding great..
OMG! Always amazing and criative!
My ears are blessed
Anyone else really really want them to do Kiss from a Rose by Seal? I think it would be amazing.
The guy with mustache is unreal He shocked me every time he sings
This take me back to the good times! 😭💃🏻🎧📻📼💙💙
MITCHHHHHHHHH!!!!! WHAT DID YOU JUST DO I MEAN!! WOW
Good old Pentatonix that we all love BUT the medley parts look like they just come from different peformances and attached end to end. The costume changes added to the problem. Sure, we're in the midst of distancing and 'stay at home' choices but i'm sure the techno-geniuses that you've used before could have come up with effects to make this look more like the other more seamless pandemic compilations. Kirstin, I'm glad you've progressed from the look of a little girl to that of a young woman.
Love it  You nilled it
I tried 1.25 and let tell yeah it one hell of a nightcore
Just amazing!!!! So many flashbacks to my teen years I can’t stop thinking.  So talented I forgot how much effort all made doing this video. Great songs, you are the best Pentatonix!
I want the full version of La Bouche be my lover yesterday!! Once again, so good!!
I loved it..
Kirstin ROCKS that hair oh my goodness.
Was anyone else fooled by the auto tune at first? I thought maybe that was just Mitch and his insane voice control just sounding like auto tune, cuz that would be believable to me.
I just found them a month ago an can stop listening to them. God has blessed them with the most awesome amazing talent. God bless u all.
Well that was fun.
Omg this is everything
pls medley song aqua...
This is gonna blow up.😍😍😍
I like your covers. This one is good but not all the dance songs is 90s. I'm a fan of Everytime we touch by Cascada and that is not 90s. It's early 2000s. I don't know much of other ones. Nevertheless it's well done.
Yesss
Amazing takes me back in a good way to a better time
200k views and at least 150k of them were me today.  #SorryNotSorry
Absolutely amazing!!!! Loved every minute
I so want to hear a full cover of Cher's Do You Believe now.
Auu
A bit disappointed, the songs are so poorly linked
I love 90's House Music, this is my favorite medley ever!
6分弱とは思えない満足感。
I needed this guys took me back to high school 💯💯💯💯 great job
OPENING WITH LA BOUCHE?!          My childhood heart!!!           This whole thing is amazing I'm SCREAMING.        So many of my absolute faves that so many of my friends don't know!
Nooo the auto tune. That defeats the purpose of the channel 😂
Superb!!! Petition for full version on each songs 🥰
I LOVE IT! SO MANY GOOD MEMORIES!
I don't care what has to be done. Kickstarter, or whatever, but this has GOT to become an album. If at all possible in this universe.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AS USUAL
GOD I WANT TEM TO DO ZERO TO HERO FROM HERCULES CAPS BECAUSE I NEED IT
please more medleys!
I feel like after listening to this is how the Grinch felt when his heart grew a couple sizes. After a year of covid I didn't realize I could still feel what I felt from experiencing this mashup drop.
❤❤❤❤😀😀😀😀🙌🙌🙌🙌
Damn
Pentatonix I have some challenges 4 u: 1. Rhythm is a dancer/Another night/Mr. Vain/ This is your night. Can u mix them together? 2. Play by Jennifer Lopez 3. Pokémon Johto. (Pokémon 3 movie) To be continued...
Aaaaaaaaaaand I'm back in college.  Damn I'm old.
EPIC!!! I would love to see them do an 80s Mashup! I know they've done Take on Me and lots of MJ from his evolution video but would love to see them include Madonna, Wham!, the Go-Gos, etc. PTX is The Best! <3
Wait. Was the max autotune added or did you did that acapella too? Please tell me. I have to know.
How awesome!  Very entertaining!!
Oh the nostalgia. I love this!
Awesome, like seriously, you guys have amazing rhythm.
Oh man...feeling so happy and old at the same time 😅 The 90s was only 10 years ago right? Right?!
it's the dabedee dabedai for me~
Aaaaa i love this ❤️
Oh my gosh this is amazing! ❤️
i love it, keep it up 👍
LOVE YALL
😻🎶💿
A full version of I'm Blue would be incredible... so much nostalgia in combination with the incredible vibe and talent PTX bring!
ok hold on, LETS APPRECIATE THEIR VOICES BLESS US
Felicitaciones chicos cuanto talento! Muchos más éxitos 🙌🙌🙌
This brought me back so many great memories!!!! Awesome!!
This is my sixth time repeating it from last night. Will continue to listen to it on repeat.
Ah, oh you voices sweet as mana! Now THAT'S my Pentatonix! Awesome record. Great job.   edit: Also, I also vote for an entire Album of ALL of these songs in your interpretation too. PLEEEEEEEASE! Take my monaaaaay!  edit2: The level of Grammy this can be as a composed Album! Seriously. I mean.. wow. I officially have not wanted anything more to happen!  edit3: Still "Can't even'ing" right now. I just can't.. <3 Thank you for this wonderful music in specifically the way you aranged and performed it. Bravo.
Where was I? I was in my 30s then and only recognized two of them.
I was not a fan of most music from the 90's. I thought it was mediocre at best. PTX can make mediocre music so much better.
The medleys are always a bop
I love it
God, I want an Eiffel 65 medley now. This really just slapped me back to the 90s. lol
PTX gone back to there root glad to see it’s been a long time ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍
90s pop, rock, and so on... 80s? This is incredible. Thanks for making this.
Amazing ❤🇧🇷❤
LIKE THE OLD TIMES
I would like to pre-order an album with all these songs; please and thank you 😁
Sonique - Feels so Good
😍😍🤩🤩🤩😘😗☺☺😊😚😚🥰😍😍😍😍
CW flashing lights in video- migraine/seizure trigger pattern cuts.... lovely music though, just be careful with the video
This might be my fave medley they’ve done!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Trending 21!!!!
Офигенно
Still, Mitch hits the notes too high...
Amazing. Love from Malaysia
I love how they casually change clothes in between.
Espetacular, como sempre! 😍😍😍
please do a full cover of better off alone soo good
I love them so much. That's all I have to say.
This is amazing! Been listening to this all day! I was born in 79 so I grew up listening to these epic dance tunes! Thank you ptx for the much needed nostalgia!!🥰🥰🥰
I LOVE Kirstie's new hairstyle! Love, love, love!
I was expecting to get rickrolled
The songs of my childhood in a nutshell
Summer Electro Hits anos 90
😍👏👏👏 beatiful!
😍😍😍😍😍 All Time Fave Acapella Group
WOW! Now That's What I Call Pentatonix! Vol. 9
Love this!!!!!!
Fantásticos como Siempre, Sorprendentes, Muchas Gracias por tan Adorable Rola Penta.
I so want all of these as full songs!!!
the stand of hair in Scott’s face is a paid actor... I love it
Wow. Amazing. This took me through the decade of being 12 to 21. So many memories.  Thank you!
Kirstin’s hair is everything.
Love, LOVE , LOVE this medley!  And Kirsten, I Really love this new look you got goin' here. So sexy.
Can you please do more of these please? I loved this!!!
Why does Scott give me Snow vibes with those glasses?
So good !!!!!!
QUE HERMOSO...... <3 ME MUERO DE GUSTO
This was incredible!!!! I mean...WOW!! 😱
Incredible medley, but how do you not include Groove Is In The Heart?!?! That's my only note, it's not even really a complaint cuz the medley WAS almost perfect, but Groove Is In The Heart is CLASSIC '90s dance music and would have added a great flavor to this incredible medley!!
This is worth the wait❤
Takes me back... Those were the days...
GO TF OFF
Perfection as usual!
Pretend you are a judge at the Voice. When did you drop the like?  I did at 0:40
I can't even hear "Do You Believe in Life After Love" without laughing about that scene in Land of the Lost.
SOOOO GOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everybody be slaying!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The entirety is beautiful but the Cher part BYE I'M GONNA CRY
Okay, now I need this in an album version with the full songs!
Pentatonix are the #1 A Capella Group 👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Their transitions are always the best 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽.
WOOOOW 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ABSOLUTLY INSANE!
I always love pentatonix medley
What is love? Pentatonix!!! Thank for brightening what was a very dark day here.
Best music from the best era (my opinion) !
I see Mitch is still in his Joe Exotica phase...
Cute curly hairstyle too Kirsten! 👍❤
What a medley.... really enjoyable song selection
Doing Arlington TX proud!!!
Awesome! Makes me want to re-watch "A Night at the Roxbury" with Chris Kattan & Will Ferrell
these 5 talented human beings 😌
i stan this 😭😭
90's songs are such a bop literally 😭✋🏻
Omg! These songs were part of my childhood! 😍
We need several decades of medley's!!!!! on an ep!!!(added: they are the unicorns of my musical world..just wow)
Ho my ... high school bus nostalgia.
OMG LOVE THIS MIX!  Such talent and love the duds everyone looks awesome!
Id really enjoy a full version of most of these.
Super amazing melodies
It's the best!  But, please volume the base sound up
This is SO GOOD! COME ONNNNN
I really wish they would do each of those songs in full.
I need all these songs in full please!!! This was AMAZING!!
it's soooo weird hearing them with autotune haha!
This is SO FREAKIN AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! MORE MORE MORE MORE......PLEASE!
I love this! You just made my day! Thank you petatonix! :)❤ 💙👍
Freaking brilliant...
Such nostalgia! It's my childhood all over again!
The red jacket with turtle neck and gold chains, and the square sunglasses were 123% 1990s.  I know, I was there.
Woah, you fellas did a amazing performance of singing the 90's songs in some different versions and the same versions with your cool beats, rhythms!🎶👏👏👌👌 She's a style of wearing black jacket, diamond neck collared necklace and a gray dress. ❤✌ Nice glasses and a yellow suit Scott. 😎 What a neat Red coat suit.
This was fantastic!!!!!!!
Sounds good, looks good.  10/10.
2:47 that “fly” was just... amazing 👌🏼
4:00 can we all appreciate Matt's beautiful voice for a second??
OKAY - you were ALL THREE YEARS OLD when this music hit.  That said, WAY TO ROCK IT!! You made me smile, you brought me back to when I was 21... bay area... bridges collapsing... (Loma Prieta Earthquake). My husband and I adore you ALL!!  Keep it up my affectionately referred to (collective) "Science Project".  You never cease to amaze us!! xoxo
Espetacular..... Vcs são demais, são de outro mundo
tremenda banda 10 años escuchándolos puro talento
These voices are national treasures.
Fantastic! Remember all those songs!
When better off alone came on I screamed
Flashbacks to being a 90s kid and spending a night at the rollerink/laser tag facility 🛼🛼🛼
this freakin slaps!!!
I'm not complaining just confused: Wasn't Every Time We Touch in 2005? Am I crazy?
This week I got absolutely obsessed with Pentatonix without a warning so I feel SO BLESSED that you guys chose this week to release this OMG
The medley we didn’t know we needed 😍😍
love u🔥🔥🔥
Amazing as always!!
What surprises me the most is the drum effects.
OMG Scott's hair is just dreamy!!
Yess I love the 90's. It was so eclectic. Awesome PTX as always!
This was awesome, it took me back to those days......😊
Finally
Wow Kevin was solid. I loved it and wish they've make a full version of all those songs. I didn't think they'd ever make a medley I would love as much as the daft punk one, but they did ❤
Тут так много обработки голоса, что это уже не акапелла
Love yall
Mulai SMP ku suka dengan mereka, walau agak sedih sih ada yg berbeda
Ok, I love Pentatonix music, but this was a FREAKING mazing!!!!!!! Thank you so much for freely sharing your incredible gift with us!!
Ok but we NEED a full version of rythm is a dancer
cmon Pentatonix blow me away................ ok mind blown. Only suggestion would be slow it down a little with the tempo. Ive always been taught that there is a speed where the music loses its bounce and you are close to that point.   Otherwise you are all amazing  (especially Mitch)
4:31 it's the Auto-Tune on 11
I love you mitch <3
2000's next!
I basically screamed for joy during this entire video - SO many favorite songs, AMAZINGLY done. Hell yeah!! 💕🎶😃
forever icons
Love it!
Thank you so much! I love you and your voices.
Nahhhhh.... What a nice cover 😭😭😭😭 thank you ptx whoah it reminds me all of the 90s music hujuhu
This was cool.
DAAAMMNN 🔥🔥🔥 MISSIN THIS MEDLEY ❤️
Nice medley cover 🥰👏👏  But honestly... I miss  avi's killing bass drop   ☹️☹️
I love ittt😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏 mitch and kirsty you guys are the best👏👏👏
LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Although I am a tiny bit sad that Scott didn’t 90s boy middle part his hair. 😂
Okay I love them and how they sound but let’s give a moment of appreciation the the video editor because the transitions are just ICONIC 🤩🤩
This is so cool omg
Aw why did they use autotune for some parts
BRILLIANT as always ❤️❤️❤️
Love this! Pls do an ABBA medley! I'd love to see that ✨
Now 80s please
Wow
Omg the nostalgia
While Pentatonix are awesome, this mix just reminded me how much I hated 1990 pop music. 1990s pop music sucked!
THE MEDLEYS ARE BACK YES!!!!!!!
I wasn't even a 90s baby and I love this
It was excellent, although I would really like to hear a clean version, minus the auto tune and the flanger.    That being said, just wouldn't be 90's without them.
amazing as ever love you all so much you make us all so happy with your fantastic talent AMAZING !!!!!
Yaasssss clubbing days
This is so flipping amazing!! :) :) :) :)
We need an album with these!
This is a whole bop of the next level. Ultimate ENERGYYY!
Awesome as always.
Favorite (because I’m 43, and these are my jams 😂)!
SICK! That was amazing
HOW did Mitch hit the "everybody dance now"??? Love it!
They finally got to do their cover of Believe! That moment with a decade in the making. Amazing job, as always.
Vibing to the music for sure
Just took me back to club days! You all are a complete joy, THANK YOU🥰🥰😘
finally what was promised back in sing off
I needed this right now, thank you guys.   Also, the costumes are amazing.
Petition for never gonna cry again to have a music video
This is SUCH A BOP (as always)! I had to watch it three times just to fully appreciate it! PHENOMENAL. You guys NEVER disappoint! ❤️  Also, CONGRATS to Kevin and Leigh for welcoming the first Pentababy! Kaia Noelle Olusola (whose name is beautiful, by the way) is so lucky to have you two as parents!
I’ve been sick all week and you’ve cured me 🙏
Incredible, don’t think I’ve got this giddy and danced in the front room since the 90’s
Mitch’s voice was MADE for this genre. 😍
DEYMMMM I LOVE ITTT!! +PLAYLIST
A whole album can be made from these... So good.
Can the next EP be all dance? I'm still slowly coming down off of Love Again.
My youth in one video 😍😍❤❤👏🏼👏🏼
I love this!
最高に楽しい！！
I remember dancing to these songs at the roller rink
OMG! 90s kid here! This brings back so many memories!! So nostalgic! I love it!
I miss the Pentatonix of 5-8 years ago. This is good, but they haven’t gotten better with age/time.
I was born in 83, grew up in the 90's. This bring back so many great memories. This is a great mix
Is this the first time they use auto tune? I would total believe they can make auto tune sounds with just their voices at this point lol
Podia não acabar nuncaaaa aaaahhhhh😭🤩❤️❤️
This made me so happy in my soul!
Even though I'm born in 1999 this is quite the nostalgia (even though two of the songs aren't nineties songs technically)
Awesome video! I loved Kirsten's hair :) They need to do a Evolution of Cher!
I'm a 90's baby and this just kept me gasping w each songggg 😭😭😭😭
Wonderful 😍😍😍👍that s it 😉😉
Loving this. It brings me back
I NEED A NEW ALBUM WITH 90S HITS!!!!!!
I loved it!!!! so many of my favorites!!!!😍
Holy crap, my youth just came storming back!
Damn the 90s were a great decade.
Some of these songs are from 2000's but this is amazing. I thought most of these songs were only big here in Europe too!
Awesome mix, Every Time that we touch came out in 2005 but that's just nitpicky🤣  Cher was my senior year earworn
You guys continue to surprise me ,  this is literally like wow.
Why auto-tune for Cher?! Isn't it supposed to be acapella?
Amaaaazzzing
Hoping for a 80's songs medley.
Omg I love this everyone was superb...but hands down and snap boom for Mitch! Sounded unreal... seriously and looks amazing! New fav. Great job PTX, never cease to amaze us!
The 90s beats!! KO for the win!
Loved listening to all my favourite 90s songs. You guys are amazing
This 90's medley is frickin fantastic guys- fluid flow, sick beats and in general you guys nailed it!.🎶🎙🎼
Loved every bit of this, literally grew up on these songs, and Matt singing Cher!
can someone get the lyrics please
Just PERFECT! Loved every second of it! KIRSTIE!! 💜💜🥰🥰
this is incredible. a wonderful medley of voices combined with good feeling songs equals the best thing ever.
Бест оф ве бест😁 Nice✌️
Amazing 🥲
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"........
Kirsty looks gorgeous of course as always. However I think this look doesn't necessarily suit her the best.
This took me back, nothin but love
Of course it's not Believe without the iconic autotune HAHAHA
Please release this on iTunes for download! Awesome job, from a 90’s kid;-)
It's the medley soundtrack of my teenage years. Wouldn't have been complete without Ace of Base ^_~
totally awesome guys....loved it.......and Kirstie....dig the curls.
すごい！かっこいい！
Bruv Mitch is zaddy!
I lost at Cascada's Everytime we touch! SO GOOD!
So talented  :-)  thanks for sharing.
beautiful love too💙💚💛 BRAZIL
Amazing, Awesome, Unbelievable - Love it so much! I want more.
woooooowww
I am just down for a full album of this
I want EACH of these as full songs!!!!!! Aggggh
This is too good, like wtff, what a time to be alive for christ's sake, God bless you guys, this medley almost killed me but I'm still breathing because one song isn't  here🤭🤭
Increibleee!!you're the best!!
Mitch amazing as always, your range is so incredible! Kirsten I love your hair, it suits you very well.
Oh my god... THEY DID BLUE!
ptx medley is the best!!!
NOT a fan of the vocal effects on this one.  I think the true beauty and magic of PTX is their voices.  This sounds almost like it was auto-tuned.
Any other 90s babies here?? 🤩
Masterpiece! Greetings from Poland :)
Okay, that's the best new release in a longggggggggggggg time!  Awesome.
Saves my day :)
Remake the daft punk medley pleasee💖
Wellllllllcommme back, Pentatonix!
you guys really need to have a throwback album!! like 90's songs or even 80's
Neeeeeed a full album, please!!
SO ENJOYABLE
Another amazing compilation. Pentatonix is one of my favorite acapella groups and they killed this one brought me back to my childhood. Congrats to Kevin on becoming a dad!
5:30 minutes of PTX proving they can literally sing anything.
Brings back memories.. love it! 🥰
Kirstin🥺🥺🥺🥺🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
guys by far the best song medley ever. this bitch is over 67 and U got me dancing like I was in the Disco's of Germany in the 80's love it so much.
Gayest $#!t ever!!! Not that there's anything wrong with that. But wtf is with my suggestions? Alright who's using my account?!!
We love your work. Greats from Croatia.
scott's sunglasses are SUCH a look oh my god
Love the hair styles!
And the Oscar for Film Editing goes to... 😉
I can't tell you how fast I would buy an album of this. Like a whole album of 80s and 90s hits, dance or otherwise. This was my fave! <333
KIRSTIN'S HAIR!!!!
Playlist? Updated
you guys should just do “wont you take me to funky” town at this town
Guyysss!! We need a full version of Homeless 😍😍😍😍
A lot of these songs I didn't care for growing up, but hearing them come from you guys honestly sounds better.
kirstie's hair... unparalleled
So much talent! My favorite since the Sing Off!
I don't know why they need so much processing in their vocals, these guys can sing already
Can we get a full 90’s album from you guys? Please and thank you. Long live Pentatonix!
Kirstin is giving me young Madonna vibes with the leather jacket and her hair like that.
Omg this takes me back to my childhood, my dad used to play 90s dance music all the time. I really want a full version of Eiffel 65 - Blue
Full version of rhythm is a dancer please!!!!
Finally another medley =D <3
AMAZZZZZZZING !!! My ears LOVE them...so does my soul !
Should be 90's and early 2000's melody theme but still love it all!
I didn't know I needed this but I DEFINITELY needed this😃🤩
soooooo goooooood
me: I don't know most songs cuz I'm too young... also me: omg this is great!! horny me: Kirstin woooooow u look great. And Scott, wow you too.  also me: Mitch ur still my favourite, look at ur stylish self; such a queen
LOS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Am I the only one that thinks they should put out a full album with all these songs?
There's a mistake in the description. It should say "Everytime We Touch" by Maggie Reilly (1992). Cascada just covered the song 2006.
Let's party!!! 🍻🍾
I’m so obsessed with every single look 😍😍😍
next video is 80s :D then 70s :D
Happy Birthday to me!!!! 🎉🎉
You looked like you all enjoyed yourselves, as much as I did watching! You also have an amazing editor! I'll guess they use final cut pro?
神すぎるよなぁ
Vocês sempre arrasam!!!!muito show!!!!
Night at the Roxbury vibes... :D
But... Everytime We Touch released in 2006 >.>
80’s please. Then 2000’s. 😍
Yes!!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
Wow Nice!  I love You 😋😍😘
Love this! But at 2:15 she’s not saying the words “still hear” at all. Visual/audio sync error?
my mom and thomas SIDER  ELLA DAD we are from to in btraintree masstmhss  my famliy is  run  P T X
This speaks to me on a soul level like few things have done ...everything. Song choice, sneaks of Ace of Base ...wow. You’re all incredible. ✨
Well, that was everything. Yes. Also, a full cover of Cascada pleaseeee!
perfection
OMG
Ah ah ah ah...mazingggggggggg!
Yasssss! I'm screaming the whole time from excitement! Love  this!! Gold!!
Every time I hear your music I think how blessed I am to be alive to hear some of the most talented singers of our time.  Your music will live on until the end of time as we know it.

I’d love to see them do an imogen heap hide and seek cover.
Omg... this is wonderful ❤️
I loved this but am I the only one completely distracted by her one section of straight hair?
WOW!!!!   These are dance songs I lived for, since I was in my 20's.   I needed this!!!!

The 90s had the best freaking music
Kirstin and her curls are so cute!
I'm not impressed. Doesn't seem 💯
Love ❤️ it! Please do a whole cover of that Cher song!!!
Time for a dance album 2020s style 😊
I love love love love love this so much. What Is Love and Everytime We Touch are my favorites to hear since I love the originals of both.
Well thank you for the greatest 90s playlist hahaah <3 LOVE  IT
Genialne! No k*rwa genialne! 💕
They are really bringing it!!!!
I love this.  But I love it so much more that you incorporated the VengaBoys into this medley ❤❤❤❤
You can just TELL that Kirstin and Scott are feeling themselves in these 90s outfits
The music is beyond perfect as always. And Kristin's hair is just spot on perfect, I wanted that exact hair style in high school.
I’d like a full album, of each of these songs please! 😍
I'm not seeing the love in your eyes
I think we all agree that we need full versions of Everytime we touch and Waiting on tonight👌🏽👌🏽😻
Yesss this is amazingg
Part two please.
I did not want the song to end....
I could not stop dancing to this. AMAZING!!!!
I love how some of these are early 2000s songs too! You sound amazing as always!
My childhood/teenage years right here!! 😂
At the “Everybody dance now”, Kevin got the beat perfect, almost unbelievable 🔥
This is now what I will be listening to at 2am
scott gets gaier with every video
LOVE THIS!! Would be awesome if you did another medley from the 90s :)
Thank you for including Beautiful Life. It's such a gem in Ace Of Base's discography.
You have to do a full version of It Feels So Good. It sounds so promising. Fantastic medley by the way. Keep up the good work. :)
The STYLE!!! Love all of this
Love it!
Matt in "Believe" ...😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯
I love this. I mean I now also feel old, but it is such a great medley that I find myself not minding too much!
2:42 Cinta satu malam oh indahnya~~ 😂
I LOVE IT, THAT ALL, I LOVEEEEE ITTTT!!!!!!
PTX never disappoints!😍😍😍
So beautiful!!!
18 мая поеду в центр ставить тазобедренный сустав.
This is so perfect.
It's so cool ✨
4:02 - MY GIRLFRIEND!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜
❤❤❤
Wowwwwwwwwwww killed it! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Люблю вас!
Goosebump moment for Ace of Base. Loving this.
You guys should do evolution of Salena
Are you kidding me??? ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME??? This is AMAZING 🔥
. OOOH! Love her new locks/look!!!! 😮😮😮😍😍😍💖💖💖 .
KIRSTIE OMFG!!🥴🥵👏🏼🔥👌🏼
algum br'-'
Where the cigarettes and pabst?  Hardly a 90s Dance party without those...
Beatiful😍
Mitch your voice was made to slay the 90s!!  All of you sound amazing 💕
Kirstin SHONE in this video. YES GO SIS 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
Oh God, Sonique... sounds so epic. Full song release when?
When's this going on Spotify🥺🥺
I feel like this is such an oddly specific type of music to have be your favorite, but it is mine. This medley blew my mind, y'all. Iconic. Every new song felt like that moment at a club or a high school dance when your favorite song comes on and you run to the dance floor. Truly perfect.
4:45 - 4:53 Just how freakin' tight are those intervals Kirsten and Scott are singing?!  I shouldn't be surprised and yet...here I am...blown away by it.
Old school PTX medley, love it! Awesome as always, and it looked like you were all having fun. Colour me a happy fan.
I would like a full version of all of these songs. Starting with Blue.
Always improving!!! Awesome PTX!!!
What happened to Avi?!
ok, chills at EVERY transition?! WTH. SO GOOD!
This is beyond amazing ❤❤
You made me cry....remembers....thanks!!!!
I can’t tell if they’re clothes are TOO 90s or NOT ENOUGH 90s
It was so fun, because I knew all the songs!!! 😆😁😁
Pantatonix back at it again making the classics even classic-er. The voices, the fits, kirsten's hair, Mitch's high notes, the whole Cher section.....sheer perfection in a 5 piece!!!
I really missed 90's thx for this medley
My 90's teen heart is LIVING!  Looks like they got to do their Sing-Off "guilty pleasure" song after all. 🙌🙌🙌
U guys are all awesome!❤️👏👌👍🕺🏼💃🏻
THIS SLAPSSSS
this be giving me feelings
Miss your faces.
Soooooooo good!
When is a full cover of Believe gonna drop? Or better yet, a full Evolution of Cher? 🙏🙏
Please do a full 90s cover album! This is an insane mix of songs! 😍😍😍🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼
I wish they would do the full versions. I am blue too...
As much as I love this, why is he giving the devil hand sign at 3:51?  People are waking up to this stuff.
I needed this today!
🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Scott’s slightly disheveled hair is doing things to me😂😂😍😍🔥🔥
Well the 1990s were definitely NOT a decade that I listened to pop music.  I recognized 1 song for sure and maaaaybe another.  The rest were completely unknown to me.  I think that was the decade I only listened to talk radio and performed Gilbert and Sullivan in community theater.  That doesn't mean I didn't like the video, however.  LOL
0:53 <3
Very good!!!🤩🤩
Masters of Medleys 🔥🔥🔥
My teenage tunes 😭😭😭 Thank you PTX,I've been dancing through the whole song.
Wow! This is so amazing!
Kevin! So smooth, so versatile...
Mitch voice😥in in love... 👍
I have watched this 200 times and listened to their new album 600 times and my love for them grows every single day 😭💖😍😭💖😍
NO YOU ALL DONT UNDERSTAND WE HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR “EVERY TIME WE TOUCH” for YEARS. YEARS. 😭 really I’m crying
Let's all admit we'd like them to do an album with all of these songs!
the first few notes and i said "OOOHHHH" <3
i started dancing right away 💜
that was wonderful after a long day/week of work.
YES MITCH!!! return of the mustache!!!
4:15 this autotune ;//
They use autotuns now ?
PTX never disappointed🔥🔥🔥
Now that's what I call music!
Very cool 😉 iam a child from the 90 😁
That “everybody dance now” beatboxing is amazing
We need a full cover of 'believe'❤❤❤
Wow!! You guys are phenomenal!! Thank you for bringing good memories! 😬🤟🏽
The second I saw the notification...I pretty much had a heart attack. THANK YOU PTX! ♥️
You're just great you guys!! You brought me to tears with this amazing work!!
Love it! You nailed it guys.
This is so incredible omg😍😍😍
so cool!
April babies are awesome! Grats to Kevin and Leigh!!!
So good! You selected GREAT songs.
Can we talk about the Everytime We Touch bit?!?! I need a full cover of this 😩
So good.
Ang ganda ni Kirstin
´Bout time you came with another fantastic medley. Great selection, you were so young/not born to know them personally, so kudos for the research.
Brings me back to my clubbing days. I'm in my early 50s now😭. The only problem is this is too short. Mitch and Kevin. Wow.
やっはり、アップナンバーが好き✨
YES QUEENS👑👑👑👑👑
THIS IS FRICKEN’ AMAZING!!
Can someone say NOSTALGIA?!
Currently simping over scotts hair strain
Ooo, within the first two seconds I got goosebumps of nostalgia
This needs to be an album all on its own!!!!
Can you please do an 80s version?
Was anyone else getting Ducky vibes from Scott?  🙂
Wow, Kirsty looks so amazing!
This is fantastic.
this gives me amazing vibes and when something else plays that is not from the 90s sounds so foreign
anddd another MASTERPIECE!!!!
I LOVE it <3
Kudos to the editing! That can't be easy.
Beautiful people ❤  thank you for not wasting your incredible talent
Absolutely fabulous and in a much needed time! Loved it.
This might be the best music video of 2021 so far.....btw CONGRATS Kevin!
I know they can and do preform their music live. Did they really make all these "buzzey" sounds without electronic helps? Love the clothes and hair as always. This was amazing.
Okay Scott I see you 🔥🔥🔥
It made me so happy when you all went Blue ☺️🥲 love this one 💕
this may be my new favourite thing
я поражена! Митч - звезда этого перфоманса!
I thoroughly enjoyed the medley - as usual the sound is on point! (About 30% of the tunes were from the 80s.)
Wait, hold on a second, let me go change into my JNCO’s and bucket hat, smear some Bonne Bell Lip smackers across my lips, tape up a couple of JTT & Devon Sawa posters, and jump on AOL instant messenger to tell my girlfriends about this medley!
They look sooo Gorgeous! 😍😍💗💗
This is so nice! You guys are amazing!
I just had goosebumps from getting back in time ❤
So, uh, what's with the 70s porno vibe?
Kirstin rocking the hair
Another astounding mashup. These guys are just too good!!!
Do an 80s Medley!
Pure perfection.
Fantastici 😍
Anyone think Mitch kinda looks like Tokio from Money Heist on Netflix? (La casa de papel) lol
I got goosebumps from this. <3
Wooooowwwww 😱😱😱 I love it! AMAZING! Thanks guys! Good vibes, good memories!
That was awesome!
Blast from the past! Such an amazing mix!
Great!
This crazy
Вы ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНЫ !!!  ))))
OMG I love you guys so much! I've been following you since the "Sing off". I'm so excited every time you bring something out! Love Scott, Kirstin, Mitch, Kevin, Matt and Avi. I'm probably not in your "demography" being 60 years old but still, you are my favorites!!!!
<3
yall FABULOUS
I know all of these songs and I love all of them! Aaaaaah! Thank you for this awesome piece!!!
Amazing medley. Love Sonique. Pentatonix, please do a cover of her ''I put a Spell on You" !
spectacular! So glad to see Mitch well again.
I suppose the 90's was all about "Auto Tune"
Its medley really beautiful, i hope for the next please put caption the title of part song in the medley, i wondering about title about the song .. thank you .. Love PTX
So amazing,  just when you think you have heard it all and then this drops.  Literally every song from when I was a teenager. Thanks for reviving the memories
This was AMAZING!! Please do a part 2, there’s so many other good ones to work with— basically everything else from dance mix 95 for starters lol. (Saturday Night by Whigfield, Tell me you love me, dreamer, etc)
They are amazing, always!
and right after that my next "recommended video" is Daft Punk with Avi... miss those days... great medley but there is always something missing.... (now, I wait for the hate to come lol)
Can't sit still in a seat for this one! Is a dance mix for sure!
Juste magique j'adore vous écoutez ❤️
AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Flashback 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Amooooooooo 💞🎶🎵
This is one of the best one hand down keep up the work 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is my fav medley you guys have done so far! Tbh, i say that about every medley🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😊❤
The fact all these songs are all 20+ years old is making me feel old.   These are the songs of my childhood.
You need to do the Sonique one as a full length, that was utterly awesome
OMG guys... I'M SPEECHLESS literally crying remembering my childhood 😭 Everything you do is beyond AMAZING. Thank you so much 🥺❤️✨
How... just... how??  How are they doing those special effects with just their voices??  I'm hearing skips, distortions and pitch shifts that HAVE to be computer-generated.  Right?
love the song, how you put too many songs into one
you guys are the best!!!
Holy Garbanzo Beans this was a nice nostalgia trip.  Loved the choices and the flow of this. Would be cool to see this again in the future. Cheers!
Thank you, Pentatonix. Just thank you.
I would love to hear some full releases of these songs!
Ну Здарова
For all that is happened today, this massive dose of 90's nostalgia is happiness from cheek to cheek! :D
I can't just stop listening this medley, it's the most incredible medley that I've never heard before, congratulations guys, that's amazing❤
This is the best throw back I didn't know I needed!!
You guys always make my day
Man, I miss the 90's, and also you're voices are amazing as always!
I. CAN'T. STOP. DANCING!
Wow. You have done it again. Outstanding!
Every one is a banger and now I want the full cover of each song by PTX
Great one.
I didnt know I need this
I maximally enjoyed that!!! You guys look SO HAPPY!!! It makes me feel happy too 🤗 - you all enjoy yourselves so much and the sound is PHENOMENAL  (as usual 😘) - those harmonies 🥰 - those beats!! 🥰 Great in particular to see Mitch back to his old cheeky smile self - and Kirsty looks incredible!!
I believe in a full cover version of Believe
Wonderful. I lived with this songs in my wild years. Well mostly hard rock and heavy metal, but on a lot of occasions this music.
apple music??
I would totally buy this if it were full songs!!
1:14 Mitch’s “Everybody dance Now” is my favorite part
My teenhood in a video. Love it ❤️
Kirstin is giving me serious Sandy during You're The One That I Want vibes with the curly hair and the black leather jacket, loving it
This IMMEDIATELY brought a smile to my face. It sounded great and brought back some special memories... 😍🎶🎵
Fantastic!!!😍😍😍
0:15 ryan gostling on la la land vibes
Siete unici❤️
wow
OMG I love your medleys so much
this is pure perfection
What could be the reason for disliking this video? Someone please balance me.
This is the energy missing from their originals
Biggest smile on my face listening to this
Revelation !!!!!
The best ♥️
They keep getting better everyday!
Just love these guys! They are amazing
Do another so awesome
Super
*Big Sigh!!!* Oh, once again my Angels....
What a fun time!! Gypsy woman is my favorite 90s dance song
OK......Now I have to admit to being a big fan of 90's music. But as always I am totally WOW'd with this and the versions they played.......HOLY CRAP!! Over these just past few years of listening to Pentatonix I have gotten completely spoiled for anything else. Thanks.........I LOVE IT!! Just keep that amazing music coming.
Literally squealing as they KILL IT with Eiffel 65 Blue!!!! This whole piece is STELLAR!!!
Absolutely fantastic, as usual! Your voices are all fantastic.    And also congratulations to Kevin on becoming a father!
Feels more like a sampler than a medley. I want a full version of each song but it doesn't feel like a cohesive piece in its own.
Bravo, Bravo, Bravo...Saludos desde México!!!!👋😁👌💥💥💥💥💫 You guys are my favorite music stars❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What happened to Kirstin/s Face ?
Amazing! And Kirstin looks stunning 🥰
GREAT way to kick off the weekend.
They bring back so many memories 😭😭😭
So amazing ❤️❤️❤️ the world didn’t know it needed this!
I love it! Thanks for this incredible Medley! ❤️
OK, now they're just showin' off.
super
The vibes here are immaculate omg this just makes wanna dance like crazy
you must listen to this with head phones
I love the arrangement and the vibe but these voice effects are a little too much for me. I wanna hear their angelic voices in their true sound 😭
ooooooooohhhh myyyyyyyyyy gooooood how it is beautifuuuul.............. no comments)
Omg, I'm in love with the choice you made on the last song. That was the epitomy of 90s. Bad ass.
I’m like freaking out right now
3:47 <3
Cascada everytime we touch is from 2006...
Loved this medley but noticed that one song is actually from 2006 (Every Time We Touch - Cascada).
Anyone else amazed with Kirsten's hair?
All the cheesiest 90's songs. hahahah
Yaaaaaas!!!! A-m-e-n! THANK YOU!! 🔥👊🙌🙌👏👏
Damn.  Who knew a 90s perm (or at least a simulation, it's probably a wig) would look so hot on Kirstin?
I'm just lying here dead from nostalgia. This was extremely rude of them!
So goooooooooooooood 😎😎😎❤️🥳🥳🥳
PENTA-DANCE-EX!  Dance your ass off!
Классная подборка, люблю вас!
Even though *I’M NOT A 90’s KID*, I couldn’t help but to feel nostalgic in every single beat drop. Blessed ❤️
This brought back so many memories and nostalgia. I want to cry
Okok one idea: early 2000's emo bands medley.
This is so good
Best thing i've heard this year <3 NEVER STOP UR AMAZING <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
LOVE IT!!!   Please make a medley of show tunes next.
Wow 🤩❤️❤️❤️
I want full version of Cher's Believe
so Cool, Loved it, I am 59  just my style.
I love this I was born in 1998 myself but my parents listen to 80’s and 90’s music a lot so I know all of them  I just have one question  Why is cascada in here? 😂😂 Everytime we touch came out in 2005
Omg, Scott slightly changed his hair.
Back to 90's in  few minutes! What the hell! You are amazing! Great job as always
i would die for a full 'every time we touch' cover
Amazing! 💕💕💕 So good!
I feel old lol
❤❤❤
you are more and more beautiful kirstin and the group and more and more performing well done for your work
You guys are all soooo good! Everyone of you deserve an award for your voices, and the way you harmonize is wonderful.I  have  some cds  of yours all great songs and  music! You guys are great in my book!!!😄😄😄❤❤
This video brought back a lot of memories!!! Thanks for your talented performance!!! 😀😀🎙🎙
Wow 😲😲 these guys just know how to make someone feel happy
We need a full cover of I’m Blue. It has recently become my favorite song
Now I need all of these in full cover 🥺
The video production, lighting, coloring of this video is amazing!
Soooo awesome singing! ❤️ 😊👌 But most props to Kevin being able to beat box THAT AMAZING!! 😘
Lets also be honest this group is definitely a one hit wonder and they have no musical imagination no wonder they do covers all of the time. If I was another artist and they used my song I would sue them
All the best hits from those times in their version - this is simply amazing!
More Medley's like this give us an 80's and a 70's etc pls Petatonix!
You could make a 90's album - it would be epic!!!
CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID "EVERYTIME WE TOUCH". 😭😭😭😭😭
DEAD DEAD DEAD IM DEAD!!!! OMG!!!! PERFECTION!!
Ptx Smashed it out of the park.A Dance Album in the works.Absolutely Yes.🤩😍
I STOPPED BREATHING MULTIPLE TIMES IN THIS VIDEO OH MY GOD
OMG I love this!
I need it in my playlist 😍😍😍 where’s the link?!?
I definitely recommend watching the ENTIRE video... First songs were kind of whack but it gets FANTASTIC the further into the video you go. Most outfits were fire too. Signed by a teenager.
Mitch looks like Pedro Pascal with the mustache now. Love it!!! 😍😍😍
Cascada. 😍😍😍😍😍
Who else wants a full version of each of these songs?
I LOVE IT <3
This is one of their best ,if not the best medley they have done. Love it!!
I didn’t realize half of these songs were from the nineties
Every time I think I have heard their best, I find out there is still more!  Amazing, beautiful, and fun are the words that first come to mind.  Thanks PTX for killing it yet again!
the 90s , these parties 😍
👍🏼👏❤
This is perfection OMG 🤯
Spotify??? 🥺
also vibin with Kristin's bob
Wow! Shivers at Cher
Very nice full of music Power 💪👍
Up and and dancing love this so much one of your best ♡♡♡♡♡
A steeple chase of 90 songs leading to an olympic record!
Aaaaaah BRUTAL 😍💜💜💜💜
Мне нравится, что они использовали эффекты там, где они есть в оригиналах) В этом есть часть шарма 90-х
always so amazing!
PTX should do a Cher medley of her greatest hits. Videos like this one remind me of the ones they did in the beginning. They are fantastic!
Why is no one talking about Scott’s yellow suit and those glasses? The talent of everyone in this group is next level BYE 🔥
I've always loved how they do completely unique choices on arrangements but still stay true to the original songs.  As well as not going conventional on assignments.  "Who should we have open the Cher song? That seems like a job for Matt."  That was perfect.
It's amazing! Perfect!
What does Pentatonix's talent have in common with Cady Heron's last question in the Mathletes trial?   THE LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST!!!
So goooooood. Now do Hamilton medley!!!!
and now  a full version for all of these please :)
AHHHH I LOVE THIS MUCH YOU GUYS ARE ALL AMAZING!  P.S. Congratulations Kevin on your beautiful baby Kaia!
I HOLLERED this is FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can we just appreciate how talented these angels are and am I the only one digging Scott’s hair?
Yayyyyyy amazingggggg!!!!
i’m in love loveee with matt’s blue jacket and literally every other outfit in this
Makes you wonder why they even needed electronic equipment in the 90's.
This is so good. I love 90’s songs too. They’re so amazing 🔥🔥
your medleys have stepped up INCREDIBLY. So good!
Thanks!!! Good video!!!
What happened to the girl's face?
Why can't I find it on spotify? 🥺
This was too awesome!
A PENTATONIX MEDLEY? i feel like I m back in 2012
There is one thing that I really dislike about these medleys: I know that all songs will just exist in this very short version Once again the Pentatonix covers sound better than the original. And we will never hear them in full length 😥😒
I wish this would be available on spotify
Pentatonix  - amazing talent and execution as always.    Song selection - a couple  of decent ones, but not outstanding. Freedom '90 would have been great... but then a full PTX version would be even better.  Autotune - realizing it was a nod to Cher, ok... but it takes away from the raw talent.  PTX doesn't need autotune.
Genial. Me encantó!!!
CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS LIVE!!!

Matt’s voice on one of my favorites made me really smile!
CASCADA 😍
I love these song's
I always imagined Pentatonix as the Teen Titans (Go) Kirstie - Starfire Mitch - Raven Scott - Robin Matt - Beast Boy Kevin - Cyborg  idk if its just me..
god how i miss 90s music
Very beaultiful congradulations
FANTASTICO!!!!!...Quando você acha que eles não podiam inventar mais nada. Eis que apresentam essa PEDRADA para animar os fãs de Pentatonix
You've got to release on AMAZON MUSIC PLEASE
The transition from Everytime We Touch to Blue,,, absolutely fantastic
Amazing!
By the stars I LOVE Kirstin's low end!  And everyone else was also amazing.  This whole frickin medley was amazing!
That Cher Believe kicked ass! Well done.
That was just perfection in 5mins😍
Amzing how they can sing only with their moths about 6 minutes❤️❤️ Top 3 pentatonix hits: 1)Hallelujah; 2)Daft funk; 3) 90s Dance Medly:))
Mitch singing « Believe » and Kirsten singing « Everytime we Touch » is everything I ever wanted. Thank you for this, you all are awesome ❤️
久しぶりに聴いて、本当に安心したし、スッゴク嬉しい😃💕
That's a bit fat thumbs up from us, awesome :)  80s next please
Genial!!! Como siempre bellas voces. Kevin & Matt wow!!
I need all these songs in full versions😍
Why this isn't on Spotifyyyy 😭
Oh wow, I loved it 😍❤ just amazing! Y'all totally nailed this.👏🥳
THIS IS PERFECTION
This.was.SO.good. The feels!!!!! Yes! I wouldn’t say no to an album either 😁
If all the best artisan would come together and sang we are the world 🙏🌎🌍🌏🤍 that would be amazing for humanity in raising our vibrations. For world peace 🌟🌠🌞🌈🙏🤍
Anyway. I've just noticed. Is this Matt's first time doing one of these medley's? Nailed it.
Suddenly transported back to my teens.... how do you DO this? Amazing x
OMG! that part from "Believe" really gave me goosebumps!! Love you all guys!!
What can I say?? Off the planet in brilliance,  as usual.  ❤
Such a nice medley, catjamming the whole way through!
WOW🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩AMAZING 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I was about to type something then Kristin just came in with Everytime we touch. Honestly. If they end up doing Blue... oh come on. I'm dead. Yes I'm listening to this while typing.
Finally!! i been wondering when they would do another medley
Every single song choice is a total throwback and a total banger. Amazing
So good to call back to the old PTX days. Love the new stuff, but it's always going to be fun seeing medley stuff - reminds me of ~2012-14. Also... Queen medley? Just let Mitch do his thing for a whole medley?
I need full versions of all of these
Damn who would’ve thought in 2021 this would be the vid I needed haha. 90’s just had some good ass songs in every genre
ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I need**** a full version of Every Time We Touch and Believe. Please, I need it
I was blinded by how Kirstin looked 😍 she was looking 🔥🔥
Why aren’t more people talking about Kirstin’s hair?
Where’s the love button on this thing? Wow! Amazing !
Best 🤣🥰🥰🥰
Please, please, please make a full cover of Everytime we touch!!!!
You're fantastic!!!!!!!! I'm in love with all of your fantastic voces
I'm dancing 🤩
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🎵🎶🙌🏾
God I love you guys. Ugh I wish I could meet you guys in real life. Talk about dream come true.
How are they so talented my goodness
Love Scott playing around with his glasses!!
Too many switches. Daft Punk worked because each song was given their full due.   ..
🔥🔥🔥
Schade das es das nicht auf Spotify gibt
OK I'm going to need AT LEAST a full version of Cascada from this!!
Songs from my teenaged years... 😂😂😂 Loved the Ace of Base, wish it was longer!! 👏👏👏🖤🌹🖤
Love, Love, Love!!!!
I absolutely need an album with all these songs OMG
I love it!!!!!
Adoroooooo!!!!!!♥️
Mitch kumain kaba ng pito!?! Galing!!!
진짜 좋아ㅜㅜ
90’s dance music is the best of all
that made me feel all tingly
Amazing!!! And that checkered jacket Matt! Liking it
This is amazing😍 Please make full versions
so good!!!! thank you!!!!!
I miss gigi dagostino songs!
crazy to think they were all BORN in the 90s (except Kevin)
Mitch's voice was perfect for everybody dance now.
Pure perfection!
Another awesome medley! Kirsten looks beautiful with her hair short and I'm always amazed how you guys make your voice sound like it is auto tuned. Great tribute to the 90's!
Simply fantástic!!! You are genious!!!!
And that's what takes me high... 😍
Sensacional!!!!!
believe complet please!
Speechless...brought me back to my highschool years
Amazing!! Brought back so many memories!
LIVING FOR THIS!!!
Just amazing !!!
I HATED that style of music at that time (as a teenager) Today I remember them fondly (not only coz of them singing)  Is this called ' getting old'? 😭
Not even the artists of the nineties are safe from Pentatonix. They just go around showing everyone how good their songs should have sounded
This had me freakin out multiple times. The NOSTALGIA
this is absolutely sending me... my childhood lmao
MY EARS ARE BLESSED!!
goes so hard
Tutto quello che questi ragazzi toccano con le loro corde vocali lo fanno diventare spettacolare. ❤
SERVIDOS???? AAAAA QUE MARAVILHOSOOOOOOOOS
Thank The Netherlands 🇳🇱
I was NOT prepared for Cascade's Everytime we touch. I was slapped by major cringe memories 🤣🤣🤣
This took me BACK
Omg loooooove it
I'm bias of course but I just found my favorite ptx of all time...
💐💐💐👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Let's be honest: we are all blessed by Ptx official's music
That little piece of hair hanging over Scott's eye has NO BUSINESS being as hot as it is!!  I'm not a 90's kid, but I do recognize a few of these songs. But, since Pentatonix covered this medley, I guess that makes me a 90's kid at heart. Right?  I love how they all look. Kevin giving me Don Johnson/Miami Vice vibes. I can't put a finger on Matt and Mitch. I feel like I should recognize the looks, but I don't.  Scott has me thinking Huey Lewis. Kirsten is making me think Madonna in a big way. I LOVE those bouncy golden curls!!  They all sound so amazing. Just....Perfect.  I caught that tiny bit of modulation, but honestly I kind of liked it. It fit. And we all know they don't need it. But it's a creative choice, and I'm here for it. Like Kevin playing cello, or Scott on piano. They are allowed as artists to do what they want to give the sound and effect they want. And I'm not a snob. I respect their creative choices and just love the music they create.
Great voices!
Damn rly good job
Amazing thank you so much  ptx
I LIKE A VERY MUCH  C&C FACTORY EVERYBODY DANCE NOW - BORAT
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Awesome. You guys are perfection and yet, you still improve.
I needed to see Matt with a high-top fade in this. Real kid n play style!! 😆   Other than that, thanks for taking me back to the club floor! Perfection as usual!! 😘
I believe, I recognized half, but definitely 1/3 of these tunes. I was the boring music guy. Only really liked Oldies and Bryan Adams etc. VERY AWESOME as always you guys. Thank you so much for a great Musical Memory trip.
Man Mitch and Kirstin look better in every video to this day 👀🥵
When you need to look as absolutely brilliantly as you sing - Pentatonix! (Kristin is looking especially dangerous in absolutely the best way possible ;) !
OMG this threw me back to my teens. AMAZING.
was only waiting for 4:00
Oh my goodness! This brings back so many memories. I am a 90s girl! Thank you so much.
WONDERFUL..  WONDERFUL.  Love the sound... outfit changes... and the fact they you are all  having such a good time doing this. .  All 5 are great..  they all sound like Cher on that one song.. brings back  happy 80s memories..  Mitch you shine here.  And that smile .. VERY WOW..  To ALL OF PTX.. YOU ALL ROCK..LUV LUV LUV The 90’s MEDLEY.. NOW PLEASE..  80s, 70s, & even 60’s. Can listen to this for hours.  Luv you ALL!
Omg
Petition for evolution of Little Mix
The best !!!!!!!!
Can we have an album with full versions of all these songs?!!
Absolutely amazing!
Fantastic! Their very best medley IMO. I remember all of these songs from my clubbing years. Thank you PTX.
Is this going to be released as a single on iTunes?
auto tune???
This is the best and most nostalgic medley ever! Fabulous
Everyone on fire! I gotta give props for Scott, he sounded sooo great! And Kirstin - amazing! Mitch slaying as always and Kevin and Matt - what energy and crazy beats. *Hugs everyone*. Thank you for bringing us so much joy.
It‘s so amazing 😍🕺🕺🕺
💚💚 Eargasm 💚💚
You finally did the Cher song that you were considering doing on The Sing Off!!!!! Fabulous, as always, PTX!
Finally after all these years we finally get to here Believe!!!!!!!
Fells amazing & Amazing feels !
Do a cover of Sonique - It Feels So Good full version please pentatonixx, it sounds so good in this mix
Childhood trip, with the daft punk medley quality, in love!
Soooo clean :D Thanks Pentatonix for this so bright and well harmonized medley. And thanks for having not just refreshed your unbelievable Daft punk medley to surf on the nearly fresh news. Glade to hear your great bass in a more below register, he rocks !!!
MITCH
This is amazing!
Awesome again. Brought me right back to my youth haha!  Just one slight point of critique; ATB-Around The World (La La La La La) was actually released in 2000-2002 & Casada's version of Everytime We Touch in 2005-2007. So both not 90's songs unfortunately.
OH MY GOD LA BOUCHE!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS
Any time I hear Finally, I cant think of anything but Aja vs Nina Bonina Brown on Drag Race lol
I love Pentatonix, but I sorely miss their untouched performances.. 😭
OH WE NEED FULL VERSIONS OF ALLLLL THE SONGS😍💫
Омг! Это было шикарно) Спасибо!
You‘re amazing, guys! As always ❤️👌
They killed every song as always and also loved Kirstin's hair like that
Masterpiece again 👌💓👌💓😁💓👌💓👌
As a big fan of 90s house I enjoyed this medley sooo much. Such a great selection! :)
This is everything.  So needed this.  The originals hold a special place in my heart.  Not gonna lie tears and jumping up and down and dancing happened during this.  Definitely putting this on repeat.  If they made full versions of any of these I'd love it.
Im in love
как всегда , - на высочайшем уровне !!! Красавцы, - молодцы
Literally this made feel the chills 😩💖🙌🏼
A full album of all?
Tudo!!! adorei. show meninos.
p o w e r
Arab fan
WOWZERS THOSE WERE ALL MY JAMS!!! Didn't realize those Cher and JLo hits came out in the 90s though. I'm old.
The versión You are singing of everytime we touch is from cascada and that is not 90's..and why the black guy only had one solo?
すき…(   ᷇࿀ ᷆  )
Can we get a full version of Sonique - It Feels So Good?
I love music of the 90s ! Great performance
my inner child is screaming right now!!!!
Amazing!!!!
Masterful compilation, brilliantly performed! Brought memories of that era rushing back.
Omg 90's Vibes ❤🔥

Full version of each when??? Personal faves: Boom Boom Boom Boom & Everytime We Touch
YES YES YES. You all make me smile!!
Oh god this was amazing!!
But where is This Is Your Night by Amber?!
I see myself in the future showing my kids the bops of our prime which ironically where the bops in their grandparents' prime. 🙃
All the '90s kids are going to lose their minds over this!! I know I am.
Hell yeah. My childhood. Love you PTX!
Great job 👌
Me encantó ahhh Mitchy tan perfecto, Scotty tan único, Kirstin tan bella, Matt tan varonil y guapo, Kevin tan guapo y talentoso al igual que todos los que forman PENTATONIX ❤️❤️❤️
Interesting fact: While Pentatonix was still on the Sing Off. They were originally going to Do You Believe In Life After Love by Cher but they couldn't do the arrangement so they chose Video Killed The Radio Star. However, I knew that once they improved, they would be able to do this song and they did! I am so happy for them 😊😊😊
love it!
Holy crap this is amazing. I love you guys! Congrats on the beautiful baby Kevin!!!! <3
Ok but now I need full covers of all these songs
I loved it too !!!! I love you all 🥺💜

Matt at 04:01 ...la sacó del estadio.
I was born 1977, so the 90ies were my decade growing up with music, in particular Eurodance. This is sensational! Thank you for showing this decade some honor by bringing the songs back to us in this medley!

This is awesome 👍 I really celebrate you guys 🎉
Awesome!
Delicious! Thanks ♥
But performance is outstanding anyway.
Loved this so much! Two faves Pentatonix and 90s Music!
Remember when they were gonna do Believe on the Sing-Off? I'm glad they did Video Killed The Radio Star because that was epic but this is proof they would have also rocked Believe.
Had me at the 1st note!  Absolutely beautiful ❤️❤️
But I see horns of Baphomet.Honestly, I'm surprised.
I was just listening to vengaboys- WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT- Okay I love it
What the hell in the world was that all about! This was sooooo amazing! Let's appreciate how gorgeous everyone looks? Like hellooooo?
I love you ptx
Wow Mat really cleans up well. That red jacket, yes please 😁
faaaan - tas - tic!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
As I have always loved.. Kirstin you are radiant.. 😍
Fantastic Medley! They all sound great! They also look so stylish through their clothing changes. Such a fun video to watch again and again.
Some of these tracks I heard on discotheques in the end of 90th:).
Contrary to popular belief, time travel is actually real, and if you listen closely you can feel yourself being violently thrown decades into the past
Love it. Completely.
When are we getting a full version of Believe on it’s own?!?!
Wow, reminds me of good times! 💜
love the 90's and love this medley, love PTX, thank you
Hay no I give up too much 🔥🔥🔥🇿🇦
Best group alive hands down!!!!
heh... as of now, some 40 people have been caught dancing to the beat and blamed the track for their embarrassment... :P
i love those subtle touches of artistic autotune!
All the songs are really from the 90th:).
These are cool tracks sound incredible.
Gorgeous! 😍😍🥳
Wanna be my lover...Sings a rich and lonely woman:).
I love this so much. Thanks guys for blessing my ears
❤️❤️❤️❤️🕺🏻💃🕺🏻💃
Are these guys for real? This is insane! Now one for all the other decades please.
Vocapeople😊
1:13やばいw
Look at it. It's quite a famous song.
You guys are great!, but I guess you're tired of hearing it!
OMG I can’t.. this is just too good. 😍💃💃
THESE SONGS ARE FROM THE 90’s?! I feel almost lied to being born in the 2000’s and hearing these songs played continuously as if they just came out on the radio as a kid.
Me before listening to the medley: Oh I am too young to know these songs Me after watching the vid: frick I'm old
Let's listen Pentatonix. It's quite a good band.
Um, Kevin CARRIED this medley with his beats! Took me right back to high school (yep, I'm that old).  LOVED THIS!
I can't get over how they always sound and look so good!!
BITINNNNNNN. DAPAT 1HOURS TO. NHAHAHA PERO GOODS. GANDA. OSAM. 😍😍
Nice
Lovely medley!!
Супер
Please!!! Why is everyone acting so surprised?? This is fucking PTX. The greatest acapella group of all time. Dam near the greatest music group of all time of all genres
Круто!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing!
Every 90’s road trip in one video!
I feel nobody talks enough about kristin's perfection 💗💗💗💗💗
The drip in this Video is too strong!
90 Dance video is so maysing 😎💃🔝👏👏👏🌞
Full song list is in the description for those who want them!
Thank you for this!  The 90’s was my era and you took me straight back there and (as always) made it sound AMAZING!
I'm loving the songs choices 😍😍😍😍
What about an ABBA Medley? 🥺🙌🏻
Outfits are great, kudos to the stylist
Thank you for making this morning infinitely times better!! Just incredible.
I AM IN LOVE! I've been a little "meh" about them in the past months, but this? HOLY COW, THEY NAILED IT
When you recognise the hits from the first milliseconds.....  90s...  my teenage years...
First second almost die
Scott's hair is looking fineeeeee
I'm crying! This video sums up ever single song my friends and I were obsessed with in High School. And no it wasnt in the 90's either
Music was fun in the 90s. Good old memories.
Immediately back at The Loading Zone in St. Louis with metallic muscle-Ts, bellybutton piercings, highlights, and low-rise Girbauds... sigh.
Best thing about this video How they all smile at the camera throughout the video knowing we'll be smiling listening to these throwbacks being reminded of summers gone in the 90s. It's like they are low-key breaking the 4th wall also appreciating the throwback songs while singing them.UGH I LOVE THEM ALL ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
We need full versions of these songs. Seriously. Please follow through with this. A whole album. It would sell like crazy.
This was fun!!!!
CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS!!! CAN SOMEONE HELP ME
Fire
i need a full version of Rhythm is a Dancer!!!
Best era for club music
This one will be so epic live I can already feel it
A gret video again!great voices! I love you all!I would love everybody to sing more lines!
Matt as Cher is the best.
❤️❤️❤️
If only this was a preview of their next album.
That was so good to my lucy.
My childhood memories in 5.44 minutes. But you forgot Saturday Night, Coco Jambo, Macarena😱
There is no one to compare with these 5 people they are just incredible. Another triumph they've done it again
Well that made me feel old! 🤣🤣
90s dance medley mixed with The lucky ones could sound really good
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL WITH PENTATONIX!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Good old days. Thanks for the memories. ❤️
I love pentatonix, but Mitch be dressed like Jack Skellington 🖤🖤🖤

Lyrics: Oh-oh yeah Wanna be my lover? Oh-oh yeah Wanna be my- What is love? Baby don't hurt me Don't hurt me No more La la la la la It's all around the world Just la la la la la And everybody's singing Do you think you're better off alone? Do you think you're better off alone? Everybody dance now! Give me the music! Everybody dance now! Rhythm is a dancer It's a souls companion You can feel it everywhere Lift your hands an voices Free your mind and join us You can feel it in the air Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room Let's spend the night together From now until forever Boom boom boom boom I wanna go boom boom Let's spend the night together Together in my room Your love, it feels so good And that's what takes me high Higher than I've been before It's you im always thinking of Ooh ooh baby I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive 'cause everytime we touch I get this feeling And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly Can't you hear my heart beat fast? I want this to last, need you by my side I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa Da be dee da ba daa, da be dee da ba daa Deep inside, deep deep down inside You got to show me love Heart breaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving love And getting no where, no where Waiting for tonight When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight It's a beautiful life It's a beautiful life No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside  And I can't break through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe in But after all, it's said and done You're gonna be the lonely one oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside myself I really don't think you're strong enough Finally you came along The way I feel about you It just cant be wrong If you only knew the way I feel about you I just can't describe it, oh no no Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face My feeling can't describe it Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face And I just cannot hide it Finally!
It's only me, or Mitch looks like a gangster with those mustaches? 🤔 😂😂😂 PS. They are perfect, as always ❤️❤️ Love them 😍😍
I'm still listening🙃
2:59 wth mitch 😲😲
Um álbum completo do Pentatonix com essas músicas é tudo que eu preciso agora.
I need this live
I literally want kirstie' s hair ;)
Everytime I listen to you guys I cannot “Believe” my ears... the best pandemic to go “Pentatonix’s Medleys”
Okay.  So how about the outfits?  I like Matt's blue checker jacket, Scott's suede jacket, and Kirstin's silver dress.  Because, you know...Silver! The music was awesome, but of course it would be.  I still think that they are all extra-terrestrials, because that is the only explanation for how five people could be that good every time.
BANGIN'!!
LOVE IT!!!!!
I can’t stop listening this 👌🏻 I grew up with this music and the idea to make this cover is amazing . Love you all and you look unbelievable good .
Their music makes me excited to hear more
You are awesome guys !!!!! ♥♥♥
Omg I died at 1:15
4:05 ❤️
Yeah, "Finally" you guys did this!! On. Freaking. Point. 😎❤😎❤😎❤😎
100%
damn we need a full album
OMG, YES!!!
This was interesting. My kids were Teenagers in the 90s and there were a lot of songs I didn’t recognize in the early part.  Still loved it!
Grandiose !!!
“It feels so good” 1:53 “Finally” 4:53 😁😁 2 my fave remixes 😻👌🏻
90s??? Cascada's Everytime We Touch was 2006!!!
The Cher ‘Believe’ song should have significance to Pentatonix. They were supposed to perform that song on the Sing Off but they did Video killed the radio star instead. Look at them almost 9 years later slaying it!!! Love them so so much!!
killed it. amazing so good
the fact that they always makes us go SPEECHLESS!
Love it❤❤❤❤❤

I love it, guys!!! You are not close to perfection... You are perfect. Maybe also above & beyond perfect <3 And by the way, I love the way you mastered Cher - Believe, after years since Sing Off. No issues with any rhythm or anything whatsoever!!
Oh yeah ! Tomorrow it's my birthday and you just offer me all the music from my teenage time 🥰 Thanks a lot 😉      God bless you all 😘
Hola ángeles. Siempre me sorprenden.  Bueno todo recuerdo, en el tiempo en música. Bien 👍. Les mando abrazos a todos, y a mi visión un beso con todo respeto.  Bendiciones. 🙏🌹🙏🌹🙏🌹 🙏🌹🙏🌹🙏🌹
Starting the weekend with 90's nostalgia! Got goosebumps when I heard several songs after a long time again! Amazing medley!
Nice job mashing up with 90's music
Shirts and jackets for everyone would be better, more cohesive.
I can't wait to her Footloose by Kenny Loggins
Sooo much memory’s with these songs. Incredible good
AHH sooo gooood.

Mitchy is smiling again!! That makes my heart happy!!!!! Amazing dance mix! Knew almost all of the songs and I agree with the person that said we're missing the 70's and 80's......Maybe the next 2?????
Believe by Cher- the cover that was 10 years in the making..  Definitely worth the wait!  This was so fun!
WOWWWW Incredible mastering!!11 musical masterpiece, amazing harmonies and and chords also stunning video and unbelievable edit  Aaand it just represanted my latest playlist
I miss the "heeeey what's up you guys, thanks for watching aaaaaand .... Don't forget to subscribe" at the end

Pentatonix: Músicas dos anos 90 Eu: músicas das Jovem Pan
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never saw Kirstie singing so beautifully
Richtig gut...90er un Ptx vereint..ich liebe es
Thank you for revisiting my childhood, THE NOSTALGIA IS REAL!😭😭😭
Since i discovered this amazing group (thanks chan and baek) I haven´t been able to stop listening to their entire repertoire, I love how they complement uff asjhjadh  gracias por tanto arte ۹⌤_⌤۹
I needed this
Oh my, I just loved this, well done 👍 ❤
Generally it's this music kind is not my tune but... I know most originals and... you did fantastic mix. big thx.
So good! I'd imagine this would be really good live. Hopefully we'll get to hear it live eventually.
Just for fun, they should take a small phone book and really prove what we all know!
LOVE LOVE LOVE This!
This was MAGIC! This is what Pentatonix does best! This is so totally Grammy perfect!
Ну вы просто красавчики!Такие Вы КЛАСНЫЕ!!!Спасибо за такой микс!Огромное удовольствие Вас слушать и видеть!
90s kids stand up!!
Kocham Was jesteś niesamowici 🤗
Thanks for this PTX. A lot of these songs were part of the sound track to my life from high school to college. Though to be honest in my early highschool days I was the weird Asian grunge kid who found himself loving C&C music factory. Was hoping to hear a bit of Rythm Nation and was actually surprised you guys didn't do a bit of Aqua's Barbie Girl, but I love this so much. It took me back, though I did cringe when I heard What is Love. That thing was played to death back then in radio and clubs. Thank you Pentatonix! Maybe do a 90's R&B medley next?!
Gorgeous!
This feels like the OG PTX days😭😭😭!!!!?
Love this, but voice tune? Was it necessary?
Talk about a blast from the past!! That was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so nostalgic.
love ittt!
That’s absolute FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Ma come cavolo fa mitch a fare quelle note così alte 😅
jo Kevins beatboxing on "everbody dance now" is unreal!!!
Thank you for sharing your amazing gifts!! 🙏
is  amazing ❤
BRUH MITCH'S _"Everybody dance now"_ IS JUST- IDEK HOW TO REACT, MITCHHHH UR VOICE IS BEYONDDD MAGNIFICENT I-
This video is absolutely perfect, nothing more to say.
OMG I am 25 again!  Thank you, PTX!!!!  ❤️❤️
Pentatonix, su nivel musical es muy alto! - cuál es su destino? La estratosfera? ☝️🤔🎼💓🇦🇷👍
So amazing. As a Gen X fan it felt like you tailor made this medley for me. Thank you!!! Love it and love you guys!
Love it 🤗
Mitch Grassi looks with every video more ridiculous than before
damn!  good one!  I love it.  5 stars.
What amazing talent!!!
You just took my music youth/life and slayed it.
Me: loves dance music, makes me feel happy and energized  Also me: tearing up through this whole video!  PTX just killed this!
I love you
CINTA SATU MALAM!!!!!!
Kirstin's silver look is GOALS
Everybody dance now!!!!
One word: SPECTACULAR!!
This is just awesome..... Seriously.... Awesome..... This takes me right back to the 90s!!!
I want to buy this on ITunes!
Bravooooo ..!!!!  M sentí cómo Cuando era niña y escuchaba todo esto ..!!! Son maravilloso ..!!!!
Is it wierd that I recognize all these songs
Amazing medley, really loved it!!! I really don't know what I would do without your music!!
I love your music, but i hope u can serve more better bass medley
久々のメドレーきたぁぁぁぁ
When you’re a 2000s kid and only know a fraction of these songs.
Amazing!
😍 Can I give this a million likes!
Wow, love it, love it just love it. Thanks for the effort you put into your craft because this  sounds incredible.
Wow does that bring me back!  I knew every single one of these songs!
Who else needs a wholealbum with this???
Thank you for transferring me back to my childhood for 5 min
My high school and some college years coming through!!🌈💗🌈💗
I'm ready for Pt. 2!  Left out so many great songs!
So beautiful guys u make my stress gone👏👏👍🤗🤗🤗❤️💚💚💚 Thank you guys for sharing your acapellas to us :) I'm waiting for this until it released❤️❤️❤️❤️
*КЛАССНАЯ СБОРКА*
Mitch's voice is perfect for 90s dance songs! Kirstin's curls are everything! the combo of Scott, Kirstin and Mitch's voices continue to be unmatched and how even Matt and Kevin?! Just so talented!
I was missing those medleys ❤️
What can you not say how incredible they are and the nostalgic of the songs. Kristi looks beutiful with her new hairdo and voice, Scott looking so cool with his sunglasses and strong voice, Mitch like always singing those high notes, Kevin always killing with his beatboxing and Matt perfect bass. I wouldn't say it's there best but my top 3.
can we get the 90s back?
The 90's children rocking the night with their medley 😍 that was epic 😍👏🏽💗💗💗💗💗
They really finally did Cher...... full circle from Sing Off days!
Mega gut danke🥰
OMG ! Love this so much. That "boom boom boom boom..." Makes me smile and brings me back to the first time I listened to it. Back in the day when I was a kid, it was played as soundtrack of " the tomatoes girls"  And I should've not watch them, But I did. Haha
Awesome
So f**cking awesome. 🥰🥰🥰 Can't stop listening to it.
Omg the nostalgia
Cannot love this more!! 😍😍
Magnificent! Eurodance FTW! :)

This is the best. I didn't think you could ever top the Daft Punk medley, but this one did 😍😍😍 Now I kind of need a whole dedicated 90s album with all of these in full length 😂
ooh, ptx singing my youth. I honestly wasn't a big fan of dance, but you just couldn't avoid it. And now it's all pure nostalgia and I love it xD

MATTHEW AND CHER STOP SO GOOD
Нажал на паузу и написал: словно нашел касету отца, где и композиции в том же порядке и те же любимые песни. Как это круто.... Дописал:  Словно возвратился в детство.
This is so far the best thing you have ever done 😍
No one‘s gonna mention every time we touch is from 2006 ?
The percussion in Everybody Dance Now...I mean...HOW??? #kevinthebeatboxwizard #shooketh
SCOTT THOSE SUNGLASSES
I need the full version of "Everytime We Touch", seriously i love that part
Aahhh childhood🥰
Oh, MY GOODNESS, they are G.R.E.A.T., beautiful voices, they're THE BEST!!!!! I really hate these songs, but love them, sublime! Guys, you're the GRATEST!
that shorter hair on Kirstin is stunning.

OMG this takes me back to my childhood since I was born in the 90’s thank you so much for doing this medley!!🎉🤗
Simply amazing!!!!
This was so nostalgic! Hahaha Loved it
90’s dance music is a truly under appreciated genre. It is wonderful to see it get the PTX treatment.
I always poor one out for Avi whenever a new PTX song drops.
2:55  Just making sure I can listen to Mitch singing Blue for another 1000 times
This is so much fun! Love it Guys ❤️👏🏾
Absolutely flawless.  One of my new fave vids from you now!
So Mbappe can sing so well
so sweet! so great! so lets dance and sing!
I. CANNOT. BREATHE!!!! THIS IS SO GOOD!
The organ/keyboard chord mimic @1:52 Mind blown.
Who else thinks we need a pentatonix evolution medley...?
My gosh! The voices!
Absolutely astounding!!! The beatboxing is just unbelievable! Blown away as always. A++++
PLEASE DO A 90s/00s r&b medley. The inner child in me could cry
The AUTOTUNE on Cher’s songs lmao
BRILLIANT ARRANGEMENT!!!!
Que pena por Kirstin Maldonado se esta desfigurando la cara y su apariencia igual que como hizo lady gaga. Porque recurren a las cirugías o cosmética cuando tienen una belleza natural en un principio y casi sin maquillaje.
[Lyrics] La da da dee da da da da La da da dee da da da da  A ha ye heyee, wanna be my lover A ha ye heyee, wanna be my  What is love? Oh baby, don't hurt me  Don't hurt me, no more  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh Whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh  La la la la la it's all around the world Just la la la la la and everybody's singing  Do you think you're better off alone? Do you think you're better off alone?   Everybody dance now Give me the music Everybody dance now  Rhythm is a dancer It's a soul's companion You can feel it everywhere Lift your hands and voices Free your mind and join us You can feel it in the air  Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room Let's spend this night together  From now until forever Boom boom boom boom I wanna go boom boom Let's spend the night together  Together in my room  Your love, it feels so good And that's what takes me high Higher than I've been before It's you I'm always thinking of, ooh-oh, baby  I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me I still feel your touch in my dreams Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why Without you it's hard to survive 'Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling  And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly Can't you hear my heart beat fast I want this to last Need you by my side  I'm blue, da be dee da ba daa Da be dee da daa, da ba dee da ba daa  Da be dee da daa, da ba dee da ba daa Da be dee da daa, da ba dee da ba daa  Deep inside Deep deep down inside  You've got to show me your love Heartbreaks and promises I've had more than my share I'm tired of giving my love And getting nowhere, nowhere  Waiting for tonight, oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight  It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh  It's a beautiful life, oh oh oh oh   No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside  And I can't break through  There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all that's said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think I'm strong enough, no  La da da dee da da da da La da da dee da da da da   Finally you've came along The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong If you only knew the way I feel about you I just can't describe it, oh no no Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it Finally it's happened to me right in front of my face and I just can not hide it Finally
I love PTX medleys. <3 Half of the time i'm just enjoying the music and half the time I'm asking myself "how is this even possible?!" :D
Damn ! that's good !!
Another Masterpiece! Cher!

Ok so I'm going to need full covers of all these bangers! This just took me back to middle school and unlocked some great memories!! Love you PTX thank you for the serotonin.
LOVE!!!
Seeing the name of this got me so excited, but I was not prepared for the Boom Boom Boom Boom song to show up here. I feel like I've actually time travelled to be hearing this medley and I am HERE FOR IT
So is Mitch in full Scarface mode now? 🤷🏼‍♂️ love the mix!
90's becomes sweet with Pentatonix... thank you for a masterpiece...
Come for the song, stay for the stellar video editing.
Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room :D
3:34 Matt the Demon Slayer using his Bass Breathing technique
This Looks and Sounds like pure fun😍 Thank you for That
Besides this being amazing. Let's take the time to congratulate Kevin for becoming a dad!
Wow! This  song bring back memories  ! Only 90 babies get it !❤💥
This is EVERYTHING!
I can see this on a commercial lol
Super! Regards from Poland! 😊🤗🌹
YOU DID VENGA BOYS!!!!!  My Dutch heart is happy :)
Awesome!
Absolutely fabulous! As much as I love 💕 the original, I’d love to hear a full version of Believe.  The snippet here is superior, in my opinion. 🤩😍🥰😘🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈
Damn, I feel so bad for not knowing to songs! Amazing job!
Btw where the boys who sing hallelujah? I think one of them is missing
Now I want an album of full versions of all these songs.
I LOVE how Mitch's voice has aged like a fine wine - it just keeps getting better with time! Kirsti, I love your hair like that! Oh my. I can hear what I'm going to be playing non-stop for the immediate future. Just outstanding PTX!
Awesome job, as usual!
bro can we talk about scott’s hair here
More like this please
❤️❤️💋
Cooooool :D
I’m gonna need full versions of these songs and this was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The music is great, brings back some good memories. I can't get past Mitch's mustache and mullet though.... who's idea was that?
When they did "I'm blue", daaaaamn
When you can't believe how they did that... Well, all I can say is that "WOWWW!!" *applause YOU ARE ALL AMAZING!!!!!
Wooooooow!
Kirstin looks a lot like Toni Braxton here😍 You should do  one of her songs
No way..... I literally cried man!!!! A travel-time experience!!🤩
This is just what I needed today
Pentatonix released this 90’s Medley on the same day as Voiceplay released a Disney cover with EJ Cardona from Voctave... life is good today 😂
I can't decide if I'm experiencing nostaligia or PTSD
This was a delicious trip down memory lane... 💃🕺🏽 So satisfying!!
OLD GENERATION! ARE YOU HERE ?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!? 👂✊💪🙋💃🕺👑🎇
Impressive guys! Everytime we touch, Believe, and It's a beatiful life were impressive. Matt singing Cher was priceless.
Отлично поют и импровизируют. А ещё могут наполнить звук душой. Редкое явление и качества, собранные в одном месте. Респект!
Am I the only Filipino here?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I never thought that they could *outdo* their Daft Punk medley but DAMN!! this hit hard. It did!! Dancin all day along🥰
gold
Yesss!! This is totally awesome! Oh and congrats Kevin, she's precious!!
Awesome...... as always!

This video has me realizing that we don’t have any great dance music like this anymore. Meanwhile I was fired up and grooving at the first note. The memories came flooding back 🥲🙌🏼💜
Definitely gonna need that full version of Everytime We Touch 🔥🔥
I’m LIVING!!! From the first downbeat, until the end, I LIVED!
You better believe this will be on repeat all day
Me: I'm having a crappy day Pentatonix: exists Me: My life is complete
this. is. FIRE!! 🔥🔥🔥
Ahhh, I love this so much. Now I just want full covers of almost all of these songs! 😍

I love Scott's hair in this! ❤🤗😊👍😘
Это было круто!!! Спасибо! 👏👍🏻
Ok the start and I really need this in my spotify mix!
I love this nostalgia, but Cascada is very 2000's. But adding the digitization for Believe was great.
👌👌👌🔝
I literally like everything in this song
they bringing it back yessiirrr
Fabulous job as usual guys! Thanks for the music.
Oh my god.  Amazing!! Im a 90s kid and this is 💥💥💥💥
They just keep getting better. How is this possible? The skill they put into this is amazing! They also are clearly having a blast singing. It really adds to the song to see them smiling and dancing while hitting those notes.
I'M IN LOVE!
Ihr seid echt klasse 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💖🙏💖🙏💖🙏💖🙏💖👏👏👏
Living for this Medley, I grew up with these songs!!!
And Avi? :c
Love Love Love this. So fun! Scott... those glasses I love and Kristy your short hair is adorable!🥰❤️
So... when is this album coming out 0_0? (Please put out an album with these songs in full!)
SO GOOD BEST MUSIC VIDEO EVER. Remembers when Mitch and Scott  lived together and did the 90s music challenge
Kirstin, you like much more beautiful version of Marylin Monroe!  And your voice killed me!🤩
PTX have literally made lockdown worth it and despite everything going on in the world right now they keep going thank you guys sooo much! I love PTX!!!
Um.. you need to do all of these for a 90s album, please and thanks
Voiceplay and pentatonix just released a new vid. I cant decide
What a medley!!
enjoying the beat .thankyou for the song .
Kinda feel like this will actually hit 80’s kids harder than 90’s kids lol these aren’t songs that were coming out when we were born, these songs were coming out as we were growing up, a lot of them have powerful preteen/midteen memories attached to them for me 🥰💓
i love better off alone
okay bring back the 90's era!!!
Ptx, you guys totally rock💖💖💖 You are the best💖💖
Love that we started in A Night At The Roxbury🤩💃
Love it all but.... 4:30 ooooooooooooooofffffffffffffff goosebumps

Mitch Grassi😩♥♥♥♥
Over too soon
Damn...I love it
I am a total Pentaholic.  I LOVE this video except for the autotuning.  PTX, please don't do it again.  You don't need it:)
Thumb up after first 2 seconds ! <3 Love this medley !!

Scott, I really like you and you’re a Great singer, but please stop doing this things on your face. It seems very affected
Omg so cool are you gonna do the 20' ? 😍
Can't stop loving these guys!!!
Im a 90's baby  from Belgium and OMG i love this so much !!!! I hope see you again soon <3
Omg I feel like a kid again,  it took me to my beautiful island !!! All those amazing  years 😍❤ thank you
My only criticism is that it was over too fast 😭 I love this so much.
I have a mighty need for you guys to do full covers of Blue and Every Time We Touch.
Niiiiiiicccccceeeeee 😍
Wow they really messed with Mitch’s voice in this one
Amazing!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
Damn! I feel so old... I've danced to every one of these songs at clubs. Missed Barbie Girl though 😊
I love this medley though i'm only 16 .
Wow, so much Eurodance. A bit strange to hear this in a compilation by a band from the US ^^
I am absolutely stunned. This is like a treasure box of songs I have loved as a kid! Thanks guys! Thank you once again. Now...I am just waiting for you to recreate your Daft Punk medley song with more songs
Omggg yessssss blueeeeee!!!!!
This is Totally Incredible, So many of My Favorite  90’s Dance Songs Remixed into Acapella! I Really hope  Pentatonix do a Nickelodeon Acapella Medley!😍❤️📺🎶
AWESOME! AS A 90'S TEEN THIS BROUGHT ME BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS
The part from 00:00 to 05:44 is the best
Good job kabisa
1:12 omg i am going to die
I LOOOVE THE AUTOTUNE LOL it serves the era perfectly
Damn most these songs sound like arcade music
I love how this one really had a chance to spotlight each person's specialties. Great job, y'all!
WElp Imma be listening to this forever.
Yes! Elementary and junior high school dances!!!
Incredible job guys! How can people on earth be so talented?! It’s just awesome 🤩
Exactly what I needed today, awesome 90’s throwback
I love all of this. Only problem wish you sang the whole songs
So many good memories. Thank you for making this!
So much forgotten music. Now I feel bad for moving on to newer bands.
Yes!!!! Best medley. Loved my 90’s music. You guys are amazing 😄❤️
Love Love this Mix you guys nailed this  only wish we could get this on an album.
Побольше таких сборников
Mesmerizing,  Captivating, Enchanting Fascinating...All that and more...🔥🔥🔥💯❤❤❤
Hi Brasil, mais um?
You all are amazing!
Talking about a flashback!!
Omg this is awesome!!!
AWSOME!!!!!!!! You guys should do all songs individually.PLEASE!!!!!! I really enjoy in.
This is fire! I love everyone's look. These songs take me back to better times.
Magic!
Brilliant.. And its friday too, Vodka in hand dancing around the room.. Happy Days :)
Great job..more if this medley on other decade
No one:  Scott:           👀                 👉🏻🕶️👈🏻
90's music couldn't get any better... PTX: Hold my beer....
2:16
90s' is such a bad period for music even with good singer from 2020 s'. You try! 💚
A wonderful performance that reminds me of my youth❤
That opening note slammed me right back into high school
Thank you, Pentatonix, for reminding me that Sonique's "It Feels So Good" even excited. I feel so alive now 😅
Отлично спели
I've been around music my whole life, (I'm 66 now), from hearing singing, piano and organ playing as a child, singing in the church choir, playing in the band all through school and through a career as a professional stagehand after that and I really like Pentatonix. But I have to say, you can take your auto-tune and put it where the sun never shines. This is the first time I've heard it used on one of your songs and I hope it's the last.
Whoever reading this, I pray for you that God visits your home today with Healings, Blessings, and Miracles. Amen.💕
This song makes me want to dance✨
😍😍😍😍😍
This feels/looks so much like the Pentatonix I fell in love with all those years ago.  The occasional surprise like this is appreciated!!  Keep up the great work PTX!!
Thank you PTX❤
Liking before I watch 🤍
I am the only one that loves Mitch´s voice at 2:01 ???
We need a complete cover of What is Love and Believe 🙏🏼🥺💙 Amazing!
Scott`s glasses are awesome
Mitch totally slayed this.
Sounds great, good mix but..... kinda disappointed with the effects like auto-tune.  I understand that some of the songs used these effects....  but isn't the whole thing that you're acapella?
I get that post-processing and autotune elements were used to mimic the styles from these different songs but it really took me out of the overall vibe because it's not something I've come to expect from Pentatonix.
OMG TOO ALL THE DUTCH PEOPLE: DID YALL HEAR THE VENGABOYS I'M SCREAMING!!!
0:05 - La Bouche - Be My Lover 0:20 - Haddaway - What Is Love 0:37 - A Touch Of Class - Around The World (La La La La) 0:52 - Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone  1:13 - C & C Music Factory- Gonna Make You Sweat 1:23 - SNAP! - Rhythm is a Dancer 1:39 - Vengaboys - Boom Boom Boom Boom 1:53 - Sonique - It Feels So Good 2:14 - Cascada - Everytime We Touch 2:56 - Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) 3:11 - Little Louie Vega / Hardrive - Deep Inside 3:14 - Robin S. - Show Me Love 3:37 - Jennifer Lopez - Waiting for Tonight 3:55 - Ace of Base - Beautiful Life 4:02 - Cher - Believe 4:45 - Crystal Waters - Gypsy Woman 4:53 - CeCe Peniston - Finally 5:27 - La Bouche - Be My Lover

What a video to be Kevin's first PTX video as a dad 😄😊❤️
My love🥺❤️
Thank you that was fun
But Every time We Touch is from 2006... head scratch but love!
OMG This is Incredible !!!!
Mitch and his high notes are back
I Love it❣️
Ohhmyygodd...this guys r just extraordinary yyyy💝💝💝😵
I can only imagine the down votes were because of the vocal modulations in one song, but it was authentic to the original.  Wonderful job.
Hey, I know all of thoses songs. 90's were great for music.
I'm loving this so much ❤️  @kristen loving the hair 😘
Amazing !!!!
amazing
Perfectly Perfect😍😍😍😍😍
So mega cool! Best Mix I've ever heard! With your music you kill our Corona-frustration! Thx for that. Now I am thinking, if you would produce a Music-Mix of the 50's, 60's, 70's, and/ or 80's  that would be as cool, and high quality as this Video.🤔 I think that could be genius!
Kirstin's look is an absolute SERVE!
that was sick
When they got to Cher I was like BITCH!!!  That Autotune tho!!
So much AUTOTUNE... HORRIBLE
I was literally waiting the end for the group “HEY!” Haha PTX medleys are so nostalgic of their earlier years. My 90s kids heart is warm!
Not a 90s kid but still loved it Ptx rocks😆😎
PETITION FOR PENTATONIX TO MAKE FULL VERSIONS OF ALL OF THESE
"Veeeeery inspirational"!!!  😁👍🏼
repeat. repeat. repeat
amazing!!! 👏🤩💃 i will share this with all my buddies on/at WA 😁😇😎 thx a lot for the never-ending smile!! 💙😘
Apparently I listened to a LOT of dance music in the 90's.  Now we need full versions!
Their creativity matches their vocal talent! Amazing!
Cher-level Auto-tune on point. This is every mid-level city's mid-90s dance club playlist.
This was sooooo good the best in a while!!!!!
Parabéns
This is simple another masterpiece! Once again what we already have known - their talent is beyond imagination. Everyone and each one, they are simply the best! And they all look stunning! Kirstin's hair - amazing! (The only thing that I trully hope is that her lips will not getting bigger and bigger).
ok i'm breathless i love you bwjsvagsv
Oh hello there childhood
Oookaaay🙌🏽🥺❤

THIS IS SO NOSTALGIC AND SO GOOD, AMAZING 👏🏽
now where is that comment with timestamps with all the song names
Fantastic 😍😻💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥 everything y’all do is pure fire!!!
Finally!!
Oh hey, Believe by Cher! They were gonna do that in the Sing Off, but then they decided that they couldn't keep with it, so they did Video Killed The Radio Star instead.
I love it. Greetings from 🇩🇪
I am living for the Scott x Kirstin background vocals at 4:34 - love their harmonies :))
Woww!
Wow it’s like I’m suddenly 5 years old riding in my moms car again
My inner child is dancing and jumping in his bedroom like a fool ❤️🕺
It’s 11:35 on Friday night in my bedroom and I’m dancing and putting the biggest smile on my face! Thank you guys for this awesome medley!! Everything is so perfect 😍😍😍

I feel like I'm in a disco while listening to this. I can't help but dance to the beat 🕺
ペンタはやっぱすげえよ、唯一無二
Amei ❤🤩
their looks are killing me. SO FKNG GOOD!!
All music these days is just about sex and drugs and a lot of people who can’t even sing, pentatonix has so much talent and good ideas, I love this so much
Does this group not do anything original?
楽器とか使ってるような音聞こえてるのに全部アカペラって本当すごいな…。 最近PENTATONIXのみなさんにハマりました！ 最高です！！
I miss l'amour toujors
Thank you for this, Pentatonix! The sounds Mitch makes tho 😭😍 Love y’all but just can’t help fangirling ♥️
Dance Melody is it good song perfect age for Pentatonix to sing in different parts in their vocals and solo to mix-and-match songs together in one song to another song. Very powerful
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes yes YES! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Although Pentatonix doesn't need autotune, the Belive cover was amazing!
Instant DANCE!
Not a 90s kid but this medley gave me chills!! PTX NEVER FAIL AMAZE US 🤍
Yaaas, Ace of Base, Cher, Vengaboys, Eiffel 65, Maggie Reilly and many other great 90s tunes <3 omg the feels :D thank you for a trip down memory lane.
OMG the high school flashbacks! Man, I didn't know PTX had any more levels left but once again, NEXT LEVEL!!
You guys are amazing
...think you guys can cover every single song in whole? make a whole album dedicated to the 90s?
My decade!!! loved itttt!!!!!!!!!!!
This was AWESOME! ✌️
I LOVE YOU, PENTATONIX! 😭🥺♥️♥️♥️
Okay, now here’s hoping they’re already working on Part 2! Wow! What a medley.
Yesssss!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Idk if I'm happy because I knew all the songs or sad because that means I'm getting old. 😢😩 this was incredible and highly appreciated as an early 90s baby.
Matt Sallee and Kevin Oulusa are the same beatboxing parts that Mix songs together and all those strength acapella mix are very electrical technique sound to beatbox to Bariton mezzo-soprano Tenor persecution Celo vocal parts and bass I love all the parts mezzo-soprano sounded beautiful pretty vocal parts of the group of Pentatonix. Kevin beatbox part of electrical smooth sound in his Throat is so difficult to beatbox very electrical technique about Kevin is doing his own part in the video
damn! so sad those lips looks so unreal
펜타토닉스 덕분에 스냅!도 진짜 오랜만에 찾아서 들어봤다... 아... 그립구만 그 시절 향수
I start my day with pentatonix music. Love it.
amazing I love u guys
Mitch is RIDICULOUS!! You guys are perfection! Ohh the memoriesss with this music 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
so good
Isn’t everytime we touch a 00s song? Still a great fit and awesome medley though!
That was amazing 😉
as an 80's baby & 90's kid, all of these songs really speak to me.
Wowww .....just woww!!!❤️❤️🔥🔥
Why does matt look so edible in that blue outfit 🤧😏 also great song i cant stop listening to 2:36😭 u guys never fail to amaze me .
My new favorite
When I go on YouTube and see that both PTX and voiceplay released new songs today
Mix music god🎤👍👍 gays  am live dieses music 🍻 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Oh my God I Love this so 🙂🙂🙂🙂
🇧🇷 E Kirstin VOLTOU a ser linda!!! Finalmente!!! Principalmente por causa da maquiagem. O cabelo está muito charmoso. Parabens a todos e obrigada por mais essa delícia. Amo vocês demais! Nesses momentos tão difíceis vocês suavizam nosso dia... Obrigada! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘❤❤❤
👹👹👹👹
It was very good, congratulations! You are spectacular, but I miss the time when it was done in a more rustic way, without electronic interventions and without so many productions. I think the old format with everyone sitting on a couch, showed much more of the potential of these wonderful voices.
in love with how they use autotune for the vibes and nothing else
This made my day🤗🤗 thank you so much😘😘 it´s tha bomb🎉🔥
You are awesome!
To those who down voted this dont know what music is.
Great performance guys. But can you do this for each song to have it separatly, Thanks guys. Love your work.
I'm french and i love it Magnifique medley de son Eurodance 1990-2000
Goddamn QUALITY!! Thank you for saving everyone from the world for 5 minutes ♥️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a great bday gift!! You all NEVER disappoint!!!  #Classic90s 🥰🎉💚🙌🏾
It's PERFECT! 🥳 You're PERFECT too! 🤗
Sheer bloody brilliance!
Te amo Mitch Grassi 😍😍😍🥰🥰
Oh man, this music is my childhood!
YES 🤩
Sensational!!! 🤩🤩🤩
90s, in these year I was in the height of my adolescence, going every weekend to the disco...so thanks for this medley. 💖
PERFECTION
Wow I was raised around by all these songs 92 complete goosebumps
I did not expect this to hit me as hard as it did.
I'm lovin it. It's.... mmmmmmmmmm. Many great hits in one song. I love u guys....
has she really sung chers autotune alone with her voice?!? Everytime I think I've heard everything...
Kirstie said: 💪🏼👩🏼‍🦱
This is fantastic 👏
Amazing!!!!
❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏🤩🤩🤩
Hiper Mega Ultra Super Cool !!!   Where to go for more? =]
Me seeing the notifications: Oh, I bet this will be fun.   My 1997 self hearing these songs: It’s beautiful...
The world NEEDS a full length PTX version of Believe.
This song is a BOP. Why isn't available on spotify? 😔
It's like a modern and oldies mix
Awesome song. But I was sad there was no macarena, which was almost a quintessential dance song of the 90's!
WOW I CANT BELIEVE THIS JUST HAPPENED, also let's just appreciate: - Kirstin's gorgeous hair & makeup - Scott's sass with those glasses - Matt's solo at 4:01 - Kevin's amazing energy and of course beatboxing throughout this whole video - and last but not least Mitch's high notes and gorgeousness ._.   I love them so incredibly much.
I leave a request here. Please take a "Dance Dance Revolution Medley" video🙏
OMG! Like old times, That's AMAZING!
Friday night, a glass of wine 🍷and ugly dancing in the kitchen
Reminds me of the old times
they all killed it and scott looks stunning in this video omg
No one:  Literally no one: Background sound @4:15: aw aw aw aw aw aw
....Is it just me or does Scott REALLY look like PM Seymour in this video?
Does anyone know if this song is gonna be on spotify?
Amazing....! Love Your Medleys!!!!
Me encanto🥰
Les années 90, c'est vraiment pas mon trip. Je n'ai pris aucun plaisir à l'écoute malgré le talent de Pentatonix. Une décennie vraiment fade et superficielle.
Particularly love the DJ Sonique cover.
Vibe.
I love you guys so much. ❤️❤️
Now we're talking!!!
Whole album pleeeeease!
ребята молодцы . увидел их после 2й части Идеального голоса )
Love kirstin hair!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
oh that's where i put my serotonin
綺麗すぎるよ…😍
I can't believe Mitch Grassi exists on the same planet as me He's unreal
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
Best Medley ever!!!❤️❤️
Gosh the everytime we touch one was just pure perfection ❤️
Mitch: Let me just slay them with my vocals for 5 minutes
😇🥰
DAMN! Kirstin looks SOOOOO SEXY in this one! <3
Mitch 🤯
Oh i needed this today! 💕
I thought 'dance medley' meant they were gonna dance while singing acapella
Scott's hair? YES. Love from Germany 🇩🇪
Pit was great. Got a lot of fun. Дякую.
This is everything I ever wanted 😍
I miss it! The happiness of hearing my favorite song sung by the one and only!!
Love it! Keep doing you! Never stop!
they are amazing, AS ALWAYS, but did anyone notice that incredible editing??
Can’t wait to see this 10000+ times by myself and through reactions
They're back at medleys 😭💖
This guys mmmmm they are good 5 stars to them
Thank you 😊 on behalf of all the 90s babies!!!!
Woweee!! Loved it.. Nostalgia!! ❤️
Scott is the most beautiful and handsome person on this planet. 💕
Mitch resembles to freddie mercury in this video!
Kirstin is so sexy and beautiful!My eyes are nailed! When I noticed, I was chasing with my eyes💓 I was surprised at the laser sound like Mitch's electronic sound, but it's wonderful!✨ Matt's voice was so beautiful and calm that I was fascinated by his voice. This sentence has been translated by a translator. I'm sorry for the strange sentences!
yoooo Kristin's hair
🇧🇷 AMEI!!!! É alegre! Dá vontade de dançar!  💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤
Time of death:  12:26pm, April 9, 2021
I’M BLUE 👽
Mitch is finally getting his moment!!
OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! WWWEEEEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOOO!!!!! FFIIIIIIRE!!!!
I just came here to thank you guys to sing Believe, I love this song. <3<3<3<3
LITERALLY THIS IS A DREAM! Also this is soooooo up Mitch’s alley! Omfg I AM LIVING
A prática leva a perfeição mesmo, só eu percebi a evolução da Kirstin? No início ela cantava como um cabrito , hoje a voz dela está suave, ótima de ouvir.
I want all the featured songs 😭😭😭 in your remake version ❤️❤️❤️😍
Love it!!
I NEEDED MORE OF SCOTT AT THE END I LOVED THAT PART!!! 😭 AND HIS HAIR!! 💙💙💙💙
mitch is the living enbodyment of snynth voice! :D
Did anyone else envision this playing at a roller rink?
Avi kaplan:? (
The best group on the best musics ever made ! OMG I'm loving it SO MUCH !!!!!!!
I love u guys from Tanzania#pentatonix
I can't stop listening to this. It's awesome!!!
Very Very good 👏👏👏👏
Those outfits though!!!
PLEASE PUT IN SPOTIFY!!!!! 🥺😍
the auto-tune for believe yesmaam
This is actually amazing! I listening again and again! I have just one question: What did u use for effect in song 2:57 get your voices robotically? I am just asking because i am also singing, so i can hear for real u are all Pentatonix'ally stunning xD ❤
❤❤❤❤
Wow Scott and Kirstie have literal hair goals. Both looking mighty fine.
Taking 90s a little liberally with the inclusion of Cascada there.
I love that they sang boom and every time we touch. I listen to those songs at least once a day
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! 😍💙💙
Kirstin singing JLo. That's it. That's the comment
wooow is this real?
Indonesian pentaholic know how struggle to listen 2:15 without getting distracted
As an 80s baby who grew up in the 90s, this is incredible. I feel like the 90s gets overlooked a lot from musical decades, but it had some incredibly catchy music, and was the precursor to modern Pop, EDM, R&B, Rap, Grunge/Punk, etc. What a fun decade it was. Thanks Pentatonix!
I do love a PTX medley!! 👏👏👏👏❤❤
Tanda ko na lol
Omg perfection 🧡🧡🧡
Taking me back to the daft punk days!! Love when you guys make medleys like this!
Thoughts before watching : it's gonna be perfect Thoughts after watching : it's EPIC! song choice ✅ Voices✅ Outfits ✅ Everythings just so good! This made me wanna go back to 90's.
That was amazing. you know you are getting old when you start saying/thinking sentences like "I really liked the music from x decade". But I guess most people have the same nostalgic feeling with the music from their teenage years.
Oh my goodness thank y’all for this! I loved Scott and Kirstie’s hairstyles, they were very on point,   Best birthday present I could get from y’all   Technically my birthday is tomorrow but a day early is awesome! Thank y’all again!
Это очень круто!
Bell tones 🙃
MITCH SJSDHJJSJ
Note to me: If I want to play drums to 90s dance music, I basically have to learn 1 beat
7,7k de likes em 20min?!?!?!?! Vcs são muito bons mesmo, beijos do Brasil !!!!!!
Epic! Feels so nostalgic. X3
Omg, that's the best thing I've ever listened to
let it be known - this is the only time pentatonix will use autotune
Oh my gosh I loved every second of that, you guys took me back to my childhood, I loved every song in this medley. You guys are all incredible, Kevin and Matt wow the beat and bass was amazing and Mitch, Scott, Kirstin and Matt you all sound incredible, your parts fit you so well. I loved your 90s outfits and hair too
i love how excited matt is! :)
❤❤❤
PTX: * release DANCING medley * Me: * dance * Matt: * starts the verse of "Believe" * Me: * feel nervous * Mitch: * beautifully sings chorus of "Believe" * Me: * dance through tears *
after three times watching it i can say i 10000000000000% love this. It is amazing. You are amazing. And I can describe how happy this thing made me. I'm going to watch it multiple times again this evening. Also I may be just 16 but i knew almost every song and they're all on fire.
Просто лучшие! Спасибо за эмоции которые вы дарите людям!!!

Love it
Was so happy this popped up! Reminds me of my childhood 💙❤💜💚💛
最高です！ I want to listen 90s Reggae
Now we just need one for the 70's AND for the 80's
*Last time I was this early, Mitch still had his long mullet*
めっちゃ懐かしい🤭so cool and beautiful💕
PTX I ❤️ U. This was f*#$ing amazing. What banging 90’s tunes. Love, love loved it 😍😍
Can I keep clicking the like button for maybe a million times? Nostalgic AF! It's now on repeat. ❤️❤️❤️
WoW 😍 i like it 😊👍
AAAAAAAAA LITERALLY EVERYONE IN THIS VIDEO IS SO ATRACTIVE I CANT COMPETE
Now this made my month
Scott looks SO GOOD in the brown jacket (they all look amazing but he just really wearing that fit)
I just started screaming at 2:56 lmao
This is my entire university experience right here. Lol
I was literally lip syncing to their songs and forgot all about the premiere! 😹🤣😂
Kevin wasn’t a father yet when they recorded this
Beautifull
That was fantastic and really what I needed to motivate me to finish this work week up strong.
As someone born in 1988 and grew up in the 90s, this is the best thing ever! Love it!
I'M SMILING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MV 😭😭❤
Oooh! Nice!!! Welcome back medley! I love yours medleys!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is so good! They did again. 🤯 But it's PTX, so it's a given that a medley by them is gonna be fantastic. ❤
ok pop off 💃
Best a Capella group everrrr😍😍😻😻
Rule of gold if you're gonna watch a ptx music video: always use headphones if you can, and watch the video at least five times to appreciate what every individual member is doing, cause we know in every ptx music video always is to mucho going at the same time.
Love, love Pentatonix. They always bring the dopest!!!!!
*Mom: Why are you crying?* *Me: shows bootiful masterpiece* *Mom: cries from bootiful 90's music*
This could be my vaccine 🤯🤯🤯
hoping this will never end...
J’aime  pentatonix !!! ❤❤❤💕💕💕😍😍😍😃😃😃🎶🎶🎶
Epic medley! I'm like Scott Hoying with lyrics, but this one?? I know every word!! 🤣🤣
Ahhhhhh! I used to go clubbing with these songs!!!!

To me, kevin does the 90% of the show, the rest just do some nice choires.
MAAM SIRS THIS IS INCREDIBLE
Really loved the take on Believe - should do a single!
I love this medley. Great song choices. After almost 10 years we finally get to hear Pentatonix sing some Cher.  Awesome. You all looked beautiful and sang beautifully. We are lucky to have you, PTX!

Tracklist? /:
Damn, what a powerful medley. Song choice, beatbox-bass combination, arrangement, sound mixing... Out of this world. Btw, Scott's glasses deserve to be in a museum.
I'M SOOOO in love with this! Scott and Mitch looks and sounds just FREAKING AMAZING OMG. Also i'm soooo happy that Mitche used his low voice <3
Everyone’s saying they need Kirstin to do a full cover of “Everytime We Touch” but I NEED her to cover “Waiting for Tonight”
OH MY GOD!!!!!! I LOVE YOU, PTX!!!! 😭

Mitch singing Blue is the greatest thing ever
I'm blue!! Incredible!! Please, give me another 20 of these medleys. Thanks for the music, PTX!!
I’m living for everyones look in this espessial Kirstie’s. This was AMAZING 😍😍😍
Do tiktok medley
True fact: this comes out at 12am in Hong Kong I can't sleep nowwww😍
Imagine if they go with this arransement of "believe" on sing-off S3 ep.5  10 years ago 🙄
I audibly gasped at I’m blue dabadee. That was so cool!
This was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It brought me way back to my teen years. thank you PTX!!!!!!!!!!!
Cher - Believe, no audio effects? Just vocals? Really?
This will definitely determine if you're a 90's kid
i’m so proud of everything they’ve achieved, amazing job! you’re my childhood 🥺🤍
It hurts to realized that 90s are already 25 ish years ago
Me too I like there melodies.❤️❣️💕💞💓💗💖💝❣️❤️
Keep it coming, we are listening 🥰😘❤
Boom! Pentatonix!... love being surprised like this
Like, like, like! 🤩❤️
I cannot find my jaw when I listen to ptx that's how much I love them
The chat it's over, I'm sad :(
I’m such a 90’s kid 😂😅 I literally sang along with all of these songs.  Love this medley, y’all! 😍
Pentatonix and Voiceplay released song at the same time!! This is a great day to start, love from Philippines 🇵🇭❤️.
Pentatonix is like MUSICAL MEDICINE and i say "like" medicine because while they don't heal diseases they DO heal the art of music itself. but to sound more mentally stable and less creepy they are just AWESOME performers. Plus they are also a great way to discover songs you haven't heard that are not as well known as other songs.
Thank you for making my day better! 🥺🥰
avi and ptx both uploaded a new song. what a great day!
MEGA 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 i Love it
I love this ❤️🎶❤️
Y‘ALL HOW DO YOU BREATHE AGAIN?!?!!? When Kirstin started „Rhythm is a Dancer“ I WAS SHOOK, this is art, a masterpiece - I don’t even have words for it anymore!!!!! Don’t even let me get started when Vengaboys started - FREAKING BOP I am going to listen to this for an hour straight right now omg  (Does anyone know the AirPod sound when they run outta battery? Mine legit went down when the video went black at the end, it matched the sound so well I AM FREAKING OUT)
When Mitch said "um dooh um ah bah dee abadah yabadeey yabadaeh" I felt it.
My first premiere: way cool.  PTX hit some of my favorite songs from the 90's!
ugh it was glitchy when i tried to watch it i guess too many people playing it right now lol  its not my internet i checked ! so its youtube!
I mean ... Kirstin ! <3 <3 <3
This is such a masterpiece 😍👌🏼 Love love love❤
Full version of "Everytime We Touch" please!
*_Yes!_* I love it!
You guys are unreallllll
Seriously have u heard the guy in the white suits voice other than beat boxing omg it gave me goosebumps
I love you all so much, it's unreal😍😭😭😭

I remember dancing to all of these in the teen clubs. Such a treat! There was only one song I wasn't familiar with, all the others were big in Germany too. Love this! You all look amazing and I love Kirstin's hair!
Early!
THIS IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE!!! I think I found my musical home with Pentatonix. This music is what I have been searching for a long time. I love it so much! It's so unique and charming and graceful and catchy!  Thank you PTX, you are so amazing!
Autotune ruined everything.
They all look amazing! But kirstie is on a whole other level with this hair and the silver dress😍🔥🔥
I love how I was able to sing them all. Also, Italian pride for Blue.💚🤍❤
*kirstie:* appears *my heterosexuality:* disappears
Grammy everyone
I’ve just remembered that that was an acapella. DAYUMMM
Personally I like their medleys done live
Nicely done. As always  I love y'all harmonising😍
Its Pentatonix. How can it not be good?
Waiting for another grammy
So loved it!!!! Great memories. So loved Kirsti's hair and costumes!!!! You all did awesome!!! Tell Kevin gratz on becoming a dad!!!

I got goosebumps when they reached Believe, Cher. Incredible!
Yes! I still listen to all of these songs. 90s dance was amazing!
I am just looking to Kevin, he's a father now. 🥺😍 This just makes me feel old. Hahaha
This was a triumph! So so so good!!!
🇧🇷
Would've liked to hear a 2 Unlimited song or 2 here, but still quite enjoyable regardless :)
OMFG SOOOOO COOL!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
Super 👍🔥

Che è sta cafonata?
In no way did they sing. They SANG. And am I the only one who realizes this is the first medley they did with special effects? Like all the other ones were just them and microphones.
Showing my age a little bit, but I knew every song. Great track, PTX!
they must know how to autotune without a autotune machine
I was so glad to be here for the premiere! First time I ever got home from work on time for one of these! 😍 NO REGRETS! 😍
Someone do a break down of the tracks.
THIS IS SO LIT! THIS IS MY FAVORITE MEDLEY!!!!
THEY SANG CHER!  I REPEAT: 🚨 *THEY SANG CHER* 🚨😭😍😍
PTX,YOU ARE THE BEST ON THE PLANET!I LOVE YOU!
That was beautiful. ❤❤❤🥺
OH man this brings back so many good memories
Pentaholic here 🖤💖💙💚💛 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
They actually sing my favorite song. Bohemian Rhapsody. It’s only good when they sing it tho.
Perfection
Amazing medley
Do they have fulls of all of these
If you watched this video just staring at it with no movement of your body, you should see a doctor
The Lucky Ones album and this video just prove of how they evolved well👏🏻
This 90s kid is living her dream today!  As always, thank you, PTX!!
Fun mix guys. You all sound & look so good. ☮️💟😷
Brasil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Ahhh bringing me back to my high school days and my 20's. Music is the only way I want to go back! LOVE everything y'all do!
This is so uplifting
Wooooooo
🥰🥰
Kirstie looking stunning and Scott's messy hair <3  I died when Believe came on
Yes!!! If you don't like this or Pentatonix you have 0 taste in music and its a fact
I was wondering how they were going to do the autotune effect in Believe... I think they just used autotune.  Still sweet.
Omg they all look stunning i love Kirstin's hair and Scott's glasses and omg Mitch's high notes, Kevin is just being crazy, Matt with that AMAZING solo and obviously Kirstin and Scott killing their part as well, I LOVED THIS
Ahh the sweet 90s, my childhood is very happy
I love Kirstie’s hair ❤️
This is how is done, :D
OMG you´re so f*ck*ng amazing!!! <3
Great😉😙
As a cultured 17 year old, I knew all these songs and it brought me so much happiness, thank you guys so much I really needed this today!❤️
HI PENTATONIX THIS SONG IS AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGG IM REALLY GLAD YALL DID THIS I NEEDA SEE MORE

OMG, thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
MITCH 👏 SINGING 👏 CHER 👏
This pretty much sums up every single school disco I attended, from age 7-12 🤗
I was born in 97 and never really listen to any 90’s music, but this was a bop.
That was way too short! 😔
OMG I feel overloaded!!! I didn't want y'all to end!
It wasn’t my favorite, it was still really good. They did outstanding!!! 4.5 stars ⭐️
THAT WAS SO GOOD YA'LL
I need a list of the songs; I don't know half of them but PTX!
Me encanta su interpretación además de las canciones😍 10/10

This is such a good video and everyone will love it! It’s so technically perfect you forget it’s a Capella 💞 again I love this song like everything else they’ve ever done  Edit: everyone has to love this! I adore this so much and I’ve played it so many times since it came out yesterday on Patreon and I’m not gonna stop listening to it!

Scott’s lil piece of heaven hair gave me life the whole time
OMG this is amazing. You guys are amazing.
i sadly wasn't alive in the 90's but this is such a bop you killed it
Love the vocals and arrangement as usual PTX. However, maybe 3 of these songs were things we danced to back in the 90's at my school dances/neighborhood. Where's U Can't Touch This, Tootsie Roll, This is How We Do It, Motown Philly, Gettin Jiggy with It, Remember The Time, I Got The Power, Ready or Not, Waterfalls, Jump, Vogue, Dear Mama, I'll Make Love To You, etc.
Thank you Amanda :))
This might be the greatest group of songs to have come out of your mouth. oh my gosh
Damnnnn Mitch!
Me at the beginning: over 5 minutes, awesome! Me at the end after a blink of an eye: no, no, no, this is too short!  Made me smile and dance in the kitchen, brought back some memories. Thank you ❤️
