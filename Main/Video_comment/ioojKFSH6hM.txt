❤❤Unlimited love for you guys!❤❤❤
I'll have to listen to this a few times to get the words lol.... or you could explain them to me one day.... soon 😏🥰
It doesn't feel real yet, but thank you,Red Hot!  I first heard them when I was in college, so it's been 30 years. As I get older, I enjoy realizing that age and nationality have nothing to do with enjoying music. I would also like to celebrate my 60th birthday in a cool red T-shirt.

bella idea
fun fact - poster child is the smallest list of letters from which you could make the name 'Red Hot Chili Peppers'
yhea!  🤩
Is everyone a narcissist? I’m sure as hell am not sir! Maybe you should practice not trying to be one. Do you want to die thinking your better than others? Maybe in your profession,  but def not as a man. You and I are not below or above one another! As a detroit boy telling you. Don’t care if you have hundreds of  millions more than me! We all die, and our lives will be similar, minus the tons of girls, and stds.. it’d prolly have to be fun at 1st and when you’re in a pinch. We will be shitting pissing men from Michigan that lives end in the 2000’s. Still love you, not your GA ticket prices that are at 400 bucks plus. That’s the path to hell and you’ve clearly been  so withdrawn from normal people for so long that 50 bucks for a T-shirt might sound reasonable. That took me 5 hours of hard back breaking work to pay for, on top of the shirt I had to pay for my friend who couldn’t afford your show. It’s a complete rape of your fans bro. The love of your fans and not how much to swindle them for shouldn’t be your objective. Saw you in your home state of Michigan, at commerica park.. snuck in your family seats, and met your manager. Your manager even admitted to me during the show that he feels bad over overcharging the fans the way do. He’ll deny it; but i know who your manager is and had an honest talk with him. I appreciated that, and god bless him.   Imagine seeing black flag for 350 bucks back in 1983 money.. you’d be pissed. That’s what you guys have become. Why? Is it about money, or showing you as men going into your 60’s still FUCKING ROCK!! Is that your standard for existence.. how much we can make for a show.. if so that’s sad. If so, as a thinking man that I think of you as.. get your shit together and be like the hungry up and comers like you were and be appreciative to your fans not only musically, but financially! God bless
Underrated
Blah.. he's the best rapper I know of!!

Sound's fucking amazing
🗣 Anthony has BARS
My new song "On My Way" is very RHCP (Anthony) inspired lyrically, tell me what you all think? ;)
🎧🎶
Like usually, funk is alive on Red Hot's tunes !!!
Some time stamps for me to learn the song: V1: 0:05  V2: 0:34  V3: 1:14  V4: 1:44  V5: 2:48  V6: 3:17
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yes... Red Hot Chilli Peppers are my jam!
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
I'm back to the old days bless them for staying true to their style of music .
I heard of Robert Plant but who is Adam Ant? Is that a lead singer in a band?
❤❤❤
Its giving GORILLAZ vibes :)
Baddest fuckin song I’ve heard in along time.
This is a great song! It sounds new but also like something recorded around the Blood Sugar era with Frusciante's and Flea's seemingly intuitive string chemistry - that familiar trademark instrumental knit work meshed into the sound - and there is some seriously funky drumbeats melded with the plucked twangy bass lines that are satisfyingly vibrating my Wharfedale loudspeaker cabinets. A respectable dance groove to spin at any party and probably the nearest thing to anything they have done since 1991. Kiedis's lead vocals are brilliant here - and the backing vocals in the crescendo of the chorus are in a similar falsetto type vein (though a little more toned down) to backing vocals on Sir Psycho or If You Have to Ask. Overall it's a bit like a hypnotic time capsule - like a rediscovered gem from a Peppers previous recording session decades past that has only just resurfaced on a dusty old cassette tape rediscovered in Rick Rubin's house and that has been handed over to Flea who excitedly proceeds in blasting it out from his car stereo driving through the Hollywood Hills with a beaming smiled John sat next to him in the passenger seat, wind blowing through his long hair and ruffling his linen shirt.  ''Remember this one John!!??''  "Yeah.... wow, back in the day Flea!" Overall I love the bit with the enhanced spacey effects on the drumheads, the guitars and the elevating uplifting burst of the chorus. It's got all of the Chili Peppers magic in the mix.
Thanks for some FUNK! ✌🏻❤

👍👍👍👍
We didn't start the fire, lalala-blabla blah.
is anyone else getting a caretaker's "an empty bliss beyond this world" vibe from the new singles? like an empty distant sound ambience? i think it goes along with how john frusciante always used to talk about the importance of space in music. poster child and not the one both have that distant slightly eerie spaciousness.
One hot Minute vibes right away.
Loving this, sounds a lot like Ian Dury and The Blockheads, What a waste  !!!!
Poster child will be a classic. I called it now
Come to the Philippines please
This song got that FUNK, FUNK.
the bell peppers ceased being a rock band a long time ago, B leaguers
I feel like you can hear some Santana in that guitar outro, I love it
💚💚💚💚 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!!!!💚💚💚
This song will make you go robot immediately…Oozing that funk they perfected…George Clinton what an absolutely perfect mentor Freaky Styley was epic Uplift was absolutely amazing Mother’s Milk was perfection incarnate…Blood Sugar Sex Magic was forever game changing…This song has every aspect of every one of those records wish dashes of Californication and beyond…R*H*C*P* I personally just hope to hear some more of that aggressive punkfunk from Freaky, Uplift and especially Mother’s Milk…
Bodes well for the new album, looking forward x

This song is so good it changed my perspective on Black Summer. I went into that song expecting them to never get back to what they were but this song makes it undeniable and then second listen of Black Summer brought a new appreciation too. Can't wait for the album drop.
John Frusciante is back, thank you so much for that! I could listen to his guitar playing all day long!
Aguardando a vinda ao Brasil!
Reminds me of Walkabout ♥️
I only wish we could've had an MF DOOM & RHCP collaboration.  😪😪😪
In italy it's Monday 21st of March, 1AM, and I'm vibing to Anthony's lyrics, Chad's drums, Flea's bass and last, because I dress like him, John's guitar. All you 4 together are orgasm for my ears
Definite Sir Psycho Sexy Vibes with this one. The funk influence on their music has always been a major part of RHCP. RHCP are one of one and completely comfortable in their own lane.
This joint bangs
MOJO is back RHCP ,escutando toda hora a música e tentando aprender a letra.
Pat Finnerty has so much work to do.
Listen in this order ..aeroplane , around the world , poster child
The people that don't like it are the casuals and post stadium arcadium listeners. 🤣

This is better than the other one but I don't know if this album will be for me.
Nice to have Jimmy and Carlos play on this track ;)
Fat Dance style
Not a very memorable song
Brasil te ama Red hot chili Peppers
Holy molly, that's oldschool RHCP :) Hell yeah!
I'm sorry but I can't really stand the long winding structure of this song.. no hate, but i don't like how Anthony's going like 'habdaba habadaba hadababa hadabab hadababa hadababa' for so long, its like theres nothing new to add to the song. The song sounds like one of those songs that you sing in your head, but you only know a couple lines.. so you repeat what you remember
Ordered the album already. RHCP is BACKKKKK!
Dude out here spitting bars while keepin it straight funky
Loving that funk!
essa musica é maravilhosa 🤩é a 15 vez que volto aqui

So "Walkabout'ish" ❤️
How big!!! Red Hot Chili Peppers, must be open to new ideas, to compose new things, do not close with the same theme as always. You are great geniuses, I know you can do more.
I hate to say it, but this is the first song by the Chili's where I wish Anthony would just shut up.  :-D  I need the uber funk. Not laid back 'We didn't start the fire' jazz lounge grooves.
How to Play the Game of Life Why do children wake up with their eyes wide open and jump out of bed while we open them just wide enough to see the phone so we can set it to snooze? Why are young people energetic and ready to “conquer the world” while older people are cautious and hesitant? Can we stay young-spirited forever? After all, if life is not a game, there is no excitement in it. And if there is no excitement in life, what is the point of living? If we want to keep enjoying, we need to make life a lifelong game. This game is very different from anything we know. It is not about what we can receive, but about what we can discover! By connecting to other people, we discover new worlds, other people’s worlds! How do we achieve this? Quite simply, we need to focus on others rather than on ourselves. This may sound simple, but if you try it, you will realize how self-absorbed you are. We are all like that. Even those who feel that they are generous and giving are absorbed in their giving and do not see how much they do it for their own interest, and how they are focused on their own benefit when they give. Giving is fine, but the focus is the point here. Had the focus been on the receiver, the giver would have discovered countless revelations that are hidden from a self-centered eye. For the game to succeed, you need partners. It is impossible to play the game of giving without people to whom you can give and from whom you can receive. Therefore, there must be a group of people, up to ten or so, who play the game together. In order to succeed in discovering the other players’ worlds, we need to think good thoughts about them. Otherwise, we will have no incentive to approach them, no desire to discover their world. We can think good thoughts about each other if we do good things for one another. These can be the simplest things, but they must make us feel good about each other. Positive thoughts about each other bring us closer, and closeness opens our minds and hearts to others, so we can see the world through their eyes. As with any game, the more we practice, the better we get, and the harder, yet more rewarding the game becomes. But unlike any other game, as we improve in it, we will find that our entire perspective on life changes and expands, and we become wiser and more competent. The game of life, unlike any other game, reveals to us the secrets of life, the secrets of reality, because when you can look at something from all angles, nothing remains hidden from you.

Come to Brazil
Da Funk
New stuff is crap!
Best mix i've ever heard in years.
This song is about life. Being alive and enjoying everything as much as possible.
sounds like music from porno, like it
✨💖✨
I love this song ! This is awesome! I love the vibe 😁 like normal when it comes to the R.H.C.P 💜💜 have always loved there music!
love both new songs. thank u
Por una gira en Latinoamérica !!! lml

SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wooooo hoooo💪🏻💪🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️💋
Flea is really a good bas player
You wanted me in Cali.  The Bird call. Now what…..
I love these eye friendly visuals way more.
Cher afferrd.  Okyoj
Nossa, isso sim e música
This song is as unique and different as "Give it away" and it's got that sexy, funky RHCP groove.  Actually it has the flavor of 70's song "Life is a Rock (but the radio rolled me)" except WAY BETTER . I never liked that song. The lyrics are a "list" with clever rhymes like Billy Joel's "We didn't start the Fire" or Bob Dylan's  "Subterranean Homesick Blues" . I like POSTER CHILD way more probably because I LOVE RHCP !
Soul to squeeze...primeiro vídeo e som que ouvi deles pela primeira vez na minha vida...virei fã desde aquele dia...eu era criança e  hoje com 37 anos venho acompanhando todas as fases deles...todo trabalho deles é fodástico...os caras ainda estão na luta e fazendo um som único...como eu amo ver eles juntos fazendo o diferencial. Pra sempre red hot ❤
Back to the original RHCP sound.  This album will be epic.
Mofo be back, uplifted!
Like the tamburine sound😍
That one's gonna be hard to perform live.
À la première écoute, j'ai été très surpris, puis un plutôt déçu de Poster Child. Je le trouvais trop mou, ça pétait à aucun moment, pas assez instrumental ou peut-être même pas assez "pop-rock" à mon goût comme avait pu l'être Black Summer ... Je trouvais ça tellement différent ce qu'ils font depuis une 20aine d'années, j'ai fait woaw okay, ça change radicalement, à la fois un retour aux racines pour eux, mais aussi un risque de sortir ça aujourd'hui. Bon, ça, 1ère écoute.  Quelques jours plus tard, 2ème écoute. Je l'aime déjà un peu mieux. Okay, okay, ça groove, c'est funky. Okay ça reste sympa quand même, c'est un bon morceau de fond d'album, allez ça va.   3ème écoute : La tête qui commence à bouger en rythme. Quand même sympa.  4ème écoute : vraiment sympa quand même hein !!  5ème écoute. "IIIIIIIIII WIIIIILL BEEEEE YOUUUR POSTER CHIIIILD, YOU KNOW !!!" Poum poulouloum poum poum 😎  Bon en fait ben "PUTAIN MAIS IL EST GRAVE BIEN CE MORCEAU, ET PUIS TOUTES SES COUCHES D'HARMONIQUES QU'IL Y A AUSSI QUE J'AVAIS PAS FAIT GAFFE, ET PUIS J'ADORE CE GROOVE, ET PIS WOAW, ET PIS "  Bilan des courses : ben finalement j'aime bien ce titre 😁
Este tema es una locura! Hace 3 días no paro de escucharla una y otra vez ……y sigo!!!! Veo el video en YouTube, la escucho en mi playlist, video sólo audio etc etc every single F….. day!!! Insane!!!
Does Frusciante use a Q-Tron Plus now?
Seriously, it sounds like Navarro's Walkabout. While Black Summer resembles Josh's kind of solos...
Fantastic song. New style, always fresh and revelatory. Flea and John sweet like honey.
Yes.. nice planet X Niburu sky... lets talk- i will not fear
ม่วนหลายครับน้า
There's no superlative that can describe Flea's awesome bassline.
Please to listening the next album..... Please to waiting,please..............
man this is super funky and i love it
https://youtu.be/ZmopROxBnBU hmmm...
Música perfeita! Esse álbum será um grandioso sucesso! Eu amo os RHCP!
Ahhh los extrañaba, que ricoooo
The B Sides are gonna be ridiculously good
Very nice. Classical RHCP !!
I actually liked the direction the band was taking with danger mouse producing but they went back to Rick Rubin and the two songs they’ve dropped are good but nothing new or fresh.

Love the old schoool music
Flea is a genius!!!
One Hot Minute vibes all day long. Reminds me of walkabout
What a nice sound to hear, sensational 🤟🏽
Ok the guitar is not so difficult but I´m not sure if our singer is able to nail it like Anthonys silly stuff of lyrics and pronouncing. Cool to see how they become old children.
LOVE IT .....  Welcome back john
Funk not dread !!!! Jah!
awesome
I got a feeling this one's going to grow on me somehow
GOAT's
This song sucks, so does black summer :/ disappointing
amo essa pegada...

#StandWithUkraine! 🇺🇦
This song grows on you. First listen, I thought "this is funky, but not sure I'm in love". Second listen, I'm dancing in my office with the lyrics pulled up trying to memorize every beautiful & strange word.
Early years rhcp was great funky and crazy nowadays crap this here is the proof i fall asleep when i listen to this trash i wondering why so much people like this mike patton says the truth rhcp want play a festival with mr bungle for the same bill and why because they think they special  This is not red hot chili peppers anymore this is only its time to make new crap because we out of money corona was expensive 2 years we give the people just shitty music because we are rhcp
Lacks a better solo at the end, but this is the present day songs
love the letur lefr touch at the end. <3
I've been waiting for a long time Chili Peppers!   Good God !!  You guys are real FUNKY monks!!!
Red Hot Chili Peppers forever!
De repente aparece un comentario que no está en portugués jajaja Que grandes los Red Hot de vuelta!
Loveeeee ❤
Este tema es una paaaaja
Love u
Back to the roots, nice nice - me likes it much mooch - RHCP are very talented - Anthony's voice sounds 'young', justa it did in the 1980s - wow
This is what the world needs right now!
It's really like a slow version of Hump de Bump and I loved it
I Got the same feeling hearing Poster Child as I had when I first heard Hump de Bump.
there it is
This is the real essence of the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.  I love Red Hot Chili Peppers <3
It sucks
El sonido más fresco de los Chilli 🔥 Cant wait for the album!
I LOVE this, gonna cover it tomorrow!
John Funksciante doing wonders
It's like they haven't aged a year since 1984!

The outro takes this to a new level, love it.
Súper blood sugar grande frusciante!!
it's sounds like "Sir Psycho Sexy"... AND I LOVE IT ! ! !
🇧🇷🇺🇦
Awesome  vc
Well at least it’s quite a bit better than black summer and it’s not the same light verse heavy chorus formula as 80percent of their hits. Still stinks, but this time it’s to Tony’s fault, unlike black summer where they’re all playing a different song and it completely dose not t work.
Why are so many Brasilian people here?
I love it 🥳😘🥰😍🤩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
The logo is so beautiful 😍❤️
Never in a million years is Anthony going to remember these lyrics live :)
I enjoyed this much more without the music video distracting me with it’s weirdness.
Pressed Like before the video opened
Oh ya baby RHCP finally getting back to that BSSM album sound.Freaky Style Funk is back!
Блин, Перцы! В 60 наваливать ванильный сладенький музон - ну такое себе! Где суровая тема альбомов 90-ых?!
https://youtu.be/WIGdgzdUWO8 https://youtu.be/wJ3K7GKYwQo https://youtu.be/v4xxajgri1A

We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning🎶

Great Song. Amazing that Anthony Keatus can keep that pace up. Seems like he can sing without taking a breath! RHCP still ROCKS!
Gracias a grupos como RHCP es que aún tengo fe en la música, por favor nunca mueran
Love this band. Can't wait to see them this year
I am just so inlove!
Minha banda favorita!!! I love you RCHP! <3

My babies are back
come on guys u can do better ur the red hot chilly pepers!!!
Sorry, but quite boring.
Nu i hueta.
I like the instruments but I'm really not feeling this chorus at all.
Awesome!
Sorry this is terrible and sounds like they’re recycling old stuff at times. The last two records with Josh had better written material imo
Parece español
fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
please no...this is gonna be such a karaoke song
Brasil é Red Hot!
Just BRILLIANT
The amount of subtle flow that Frusciante pushes in this song is unreal. The entire ensemble builds a puzzle that intertwines within itself, to complete a picture that is just funk nasty.
eu amo uma bandaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You found the english comment.
Walkabout
Real Red Hot !
Grooveiraaaa, não pensei q esse album seria nesse nivel, sonzaço
Am I the only one dissapointed with this?
Mi peluca ha sido voladaa
Too good as usual ☺️
Didldadldudellidelludelladelpladel… Lapadadala… hey Bukowski and ladulideladidudeldadipimpelladi
Please send out free tickets @RHCP for the broke ass Lovers!?
Funktasticated and thing
You keep on doing what you are doing, you sweet pepperry men.
I really like the funk parts, but the chorus just kinda sounds like someone was like "*Sigh* Guess I gotta put a chorus here."
BRAAAAAAAAASIL
I love the peppers but I just can’t do this one …wish I could never hear it again
Bueno

show !!!!! <3
Som top!!!
Fuck Anthony was great here
Frusciante is back!!!!!!!
Funk yeahh🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Maravilhosa
The melody lines of various musical instruments, which are not found in the DTM-produced songs that are eroding Japan today, stand out.  It made me realize again that something was missing.
Red Hot 2022 alguém esta ouvindo?
love it! ❤
最高
Acompanhando RHCP desde 2011, e olha, só alegria <3
Happy to have them back
Este grupo fue, es y será mi infancia siempre  This group was, is and will always be my childhood Esse grupo foi, é e sempre será minha infância ❤️💛❤️🇪🇦 💙❤️🤍🇺🇲 💚💛💙🇧🇷
Funk version of We Didn’t Start the Fire
listen to it 1.5x playback speed, thank me later
Brazucas em peso, essa música é foda p quem curte red hot de tempos
Ouch all coment section is spanish how so) i think i heard this verse before in one of old rhcp songs, right?
Wow,  still great after all those years!

The guys at their Best!!! Just love it👏👏👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Yes!!!🤘🤘🤘🤘
VAMO CARAIO! brasileiro deixa like
I can't remember the last time I listened a drum track that sounds *SOOOO FREAKING GOOOOOOD* like this one!   RHCP IS BACK, BABYYYYY! 😎👌
This somehow feels like it would fit perfectly in the movie “Boogie Nights”
💜💚💙 🔹✳️💠🧞‍♀️ 🌆🐉🎶♾️
, Everyone is a narcissist' ladadada.
funkzão de verdade
Very "We Didn't Start The Fire"-esque but with Flea Funk. A tad generic, but catchy. I mean, for their age and discography, it's kind of what I expect.
Weak song. No dynamic or break downs or tempo changes. Boring. John could have blown this song up with an amazing solo soaring.
Que musica gostosinha de ouvir <3
I guess the hope that Frusciante returning would herald a return to form can now be binned.
Por acá van bien!! Ojalá haya más de esto y menos de black summer
🌬🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Uhulllllll amei a música krayoooo
É bem melhor que aquele som adocidado da Black Summer. Espero que aquela seja a exceção. Essa já tem mais cara da essência do Red Hot.
Just doesnt do it for me. Very disappointed in Johns guitar work thus far on this track and the black summer track. Very little feel, very bland on guitar and little to the lyrics vs. earlier work with either john or dave on guitar and lyrics that were a more complex and significant. I am sure a lot of older fans likely share these sentiments.
Love the funky vibe 👌
Solo dire GRACIAS RCHP!!
Stop being political, it's a death wish for a band
I love yall, but go California again
One hot minute, escancarado o estilo principalmente no timbre da caixa da batera ,baixo e guitarra
Nice song, they went back to Blood sex sugar
Love it keep rock Alive boys!!!!
Essa ficou foda demais. Ansioso pro disco.
The Funk is back! Thanks guys
むっちゃイケとる
Los amo alv hermosos!!!
I think RHCP is the greatest punk band in the past century! Thanks Anthony for releasing your 2nd single «Poster Child »🎶🎵👍
Buen tema😎🎶
Exelente... Muy, pero muy buena... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱 Grande Red Hot Chili Peppers...
já estou vendo que álbum vai ser bom..
Der Wahnsinn 🤩❤️
Se o Red Hot Chili Peppers chegasse ao céu e Deus perguntasse qual música representava o que era o RHCP com John frusciante; eles mostraria a música "poster child". Uma das melhores músicas da banda. Linha do baixo com uma pegada soul e funk  do caralho e   guitarras que se casam perfeitamente  Top5 das melhores de todos os tempos da banda
ageless lyrics.
why did i have to exist to listen to mediocre anthony kiedis lyrics, RHCP just gets duller and duller as time goes on
Listen with headphones. It changes everything. So good!!
Com John Frusciante na guitarra, não tem erro. Essa certamente é uma das maiores bandas de todos os tempos. Transcendendo sempre.
Volvio el funk jssjjsjs 😂
Flea lighting it up on this track
HAPPY BD, MF JOHN FRUSCIANTE!
I love my boys >3
Foda, como sempre!!!
You cats never cease to kill it!
Flea rules the bass world
Dherai ramro
RHCP, I missed you so much <3
Love the beat 🙂💯❤
Anyone remember "We Didn't Start The Fire" by Billy Joel? It's the listing of persons and events from the past that reminds me of it.
this bass line. LOVE YOU FLEAAA
Mal posso esperar pelo álbum completo! TOP DEMAIS!
venham pro Brasill
It's as if AI listened to all the best RHCP albums and created this beauty. Though maybe Navarro was featuring. Bloody lovely stuff 🤯
HOLY SHIT. Fellas....you brought back the funk. Much love and respect. The lyrics KICK major ASS.
love it
The sound and spirit is very similar to the track from the album One Hot Minute (1995) - Walkabout

Se nota que volvió John Frusciante 💪😍😍😍

Sonzera!
So eu que conheci essa banda por causa de jojo ?
Ahh Meu Red Hot com o John ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thank God for the RHCP. Rock isn’t dead 💜
So smooth & funky !!
MUY BUEN SONIDOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feels like the magic is back on this new album. I love it
Who's John?

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Essa música está na pegada Hillel Slovak
Omg good love it
Love the funk!!!!
Назад к истокам!!!! Как в старые добрые времена!!!🇷🇺✌
Sounds familiar, but... I realized. It lacks any originality. Every tricks, tunes, etc. was heard before someone else's song. This is like a song in a coffee shop, or an elevator. They put out Black Summer, which eas awesome and show us this. It's like showing the best and wordt song from an album.
John slapping that funk on it! OHhhhhhhh YEahhhhhh Baaaaaaaaaabbbbyyyy. Give it to me.

Amazing what a beautiful song  ,raising my spirit high again  !
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This literally sounds like Paradigms Parody of every rhcp song
RHCP é vida ♥️
Great song but unlike black summer this jam actually sounds more like the Navarros playing to me.Not knocking it but I originally though this jam was an unheard b side from one hot minute.
Frusciante voltou com tudo e essa banda nunca decepciona.
La voix au début ...
I feel like this is just Frusciantes interpretation of walkabout off OHM with Navarro
just waw
That‘s definitely got some walkabout and apache rose peacock vibes.  Love it!
How did this get past Rick Rubin. This is the worst Chili Peppers song by far. Even worse than We Turn Red. How on earth could someone in the close nit community tell them to throw this one out.
This song got One Hot Minute vibes, especially Aeroplane and Walkabout
Happy that the master (John) is back but this track doesn't cut the mustard for me. Makes no difference though as we have a full album still to go and sure it's going to be full of awesome songs. Come on boys.
love rhcp, excited for the album 🔥🔥🔥
Walkabout x Mercy Mercy
Finally! The chilis dropped the boring, middle of the road rock & got the fonk back !!!!!
Se esses caras tentarem fazer uma música ruim de propósito, ainda sim sairia uma coisa boa kkkk
Where's the song ?
honestly...this song sucks
Funkiest funky shit recently! Love it. What is that new instrument at the beginning? Hitting a big sheet of aluminium?

Noice
Não curti esse som. Amei Black Summer. Tedioso demais...
Yeahhhhhhh!!!!! Chili's are Back!!! loving the old school vibe's, this album, will be amazing
Yeah, it’s funkin’… funkin’ awful. Not TRHCP they should have developed into. Just saying! Bring it!
This song makes me feel like I’m on psychedelic drugs
Dope 👍
До сих пор удивляют. К их возрасту суперзвезды давно уже померли
🐄🛸
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ахуенно 👍👍👍
First of all I love the international love  for RHCP aka Brazil! And if this is a small intro their new album I cannot wait for the whole thing!
🔥
Genius work ✌🏼
Minha banda preferida. Melhor banda que tem na minha opinião❤❤ quem concorda curti o comentário
🌶YEEEEEESS😝 (so freaking chill) and now my brain is in peace, good night guys😂💤)
Vivan los Red Hot mierda!!!! lml
Can’t wait hear this live and Anthony stumbling over himself!haha I love his skat lyrics when he messes up live. It’s the best! 😂
Dis track reminded me why I love rhcp
I've been waiting on
Old school 90's sound .....the good ole daze
Meme worthy song
This is the most embarrassing shit I've ever heard.
Nah
:v
Yes,just hell yes
God, make some bad music for once. Sheesh. 😁
RHCP funky groove - kickin' thru the earbuds (or if you got some good speakers) 🤘

Happy Birthday John Frusciante!  And many more!
I LOVE IT 😍

Bando de baba ovo, qualquer coisa que eles lançam os puxa saco, baba ovo, vem dizer que é música boa. Porcaria. Black summer então,  uma piada.
Great song, but wow there are a ton of Portuguese comments on here.
obrigado por voltar john❤
❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
They're definitely back. It sounds so familiar. The RHCP I love.
Tony Flow is back
Both production and songwriting is pretty awful
Part 70s porn, part funk, part rock, 100% Chilis 🤟
Os melhores!!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Me encanta la bateria de chad
So glad John is back. It’s pure perfection with all four of the guys together making music
Não tem notificação do YouTube mais certa do que essa!
The Funk is back.
Joder, pero que joya es esta  RHCP
I consider myself to be super mega discerning. Black Summer was an excellent release.   I know people will have varied opinions about that but I don't really care what they think or how they feel as of 03:03 on the 6th of March, 2022. What I feel compelled to say is that this track is filler material at best. Actually, I won't grace it with that description. It's just shit.   They're capable of more based on all of the evidence. The next album will either deliver that more, or at least 9 of the tracks will be like this. Either way they'll be rich, but that's not the point when it comes to musical integrity is it.
Walkabout sounds better
The New Walkabout jajajja
Obrigado rhcp por fazer mais músicas boas pra nós 💚💛🇧🇷
So comentários brasileiros 🇧🇷🇧🇷
This song is a tribute to a number of the bands that has influenced the RHCP  I feel sorry for people whos first language isn't English, you will miss the nuisance of the lyrics
I have been dreaming of an RHCP-snoop dog collab for the longest time...please oh please make it happen.
Muita criatividade sonora
I think a certainty about the Red Hot Chili Peppers is that every album, every song, and every sound that they have had over the years is on a consistent continuum of good vibes and high energy which can stir all kinds of moods in people when they listen.  Regardless of who is in the band, they just make great music and its good that they have experimented with various styles over the years but it was always clear that it was the same band creating soulful songs that speak to people and hit a nerve in a positive way. Alternating between funk, rock, pop, punk, rap, electronic etc. and also blending these genres of music together shows they want to evolve but also be distinctive which they are. I am glad they are still going strong, are popular, and let's all look forward to the new album.
It's all about the grroove! RHCP signature!
Oooooohhhhh Sooo cool funky sound!!! Kudos guys!!
Que bosta!!! Será que ninguém teve coragem de dizer que essa música é zoada?
QUE JAZZERO!!
So much chemistry. It’s like these guys have been playing together for 30 years or something.
Top demais 🇧🇷
Thanks for existing!
Да, наконец новая песня.
This is cool but nothing like the youthful exuberance of something like Suck my kiss! I guess it happens, we all get old. Respect to them for still going though! Knock me down still my all time favourite!
that guitars ❤️
Thank god.... ....Everything is going to be alright.
the chorusssssssss 😩😩💯
La cancion recuerda a walkabout de one hot minute, pero en lo personal el fraseo de john aca se siente muy pobre, es mas diria, que suena como que rick rubin le dijo, "hace algo parecido al estilo de josh"  the song is reminiscent of walkabout from one hot minute, but personally john's phrasing here feels very poor, moreover, it sounds like rick rubin told him, "he does something similar to josh's style"  A música é uma reminiscência de walkabout de um minuto quente, mas pessoalmente o fraseado de john aqui parece muito pobre, além disso, parece que rick rubin disse a ele: "ele faz algo semelhante ao estilo de josh"
Te transporta a 1999
Reza a lenda que um bom samba-enredo, que levanta a arquibancada, tem vogal esticada no refrão. Eu já tô vendo os estádios explodindo de cantar junto o aaaaaaauiiiiiiuuuuuubiiiiiiiiiióóóó
Ahhhhhhhhhh.....the world is raising in vibration and this is proof....this is how it feels🌍🌟☀️⚡✨🎶
happy birthday, god frusciante
These slow burn funk grooves.
Yea. Boom
no le entendí una mierda pero muy bueno el tema
Am I the only Chili Pepper that thinks this is awful? It sounds like it could have been on Blood Sex.. but the band are in their 50s now. It's really awkward and the lyrics are very questionable 🤦
Welcome back Frusciante,  I’ve waited many years for you, prodigal son.  https://youtu.be/0mtwqCuJ6NY
🤘❤️
I comprehended about 30% of the words used in this song…
Legend 🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️
Fucking love it...funky as shit
Cara fico só imaginando a cena. Esses caras se reunindo pra ir pro estúdio gravar o álbum. Que vibe!!
Blood sugar & 90s lives here in this lost world 2022 🙌🏻🔥
The verse reminds me of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, in a good way. The whole song sounds like it came from the Sex Magic era... Again a good thing. I love it!
Just fantastic thanks rhcp  I always knew you'd pull out    something really cool. Nice groove
Alright! This is more like it.

Kiedis is pretty weird this whole album so far
Happy barthday john frusciante 💙💚💛❤
It's never difficult to listen to them!
🎶🎵💃
🔥
eu estou vivendo ou apenas esperando o lançamento desse álbum?
Frusciante has the best clean tone for a strat of all time.
It sounds ok. I just can't imagine Anthony remembering these lyrics. Nothing catchy about it?? Or is it just me?
Esta canción me recuerda 'Strange Man' y 'Over Funk', me encanta
não fica ruim nunca como pode
Que delícia de música, acompanhando mudanças sem deixar a essência da banda eu amoooo
Música gostosinha da disgrama vei ihulll
Dude.. fuck yes 🙌
This is a serious step ahead ! Thanks RHCP
0% chance Anthony gets thru this live without messing it up lol
Incrível a quantidade de 🇧🇷 SEMPRE no RHCP e no SOJA !   ✌
It's "We Didn't Start the Fire"
Already listened to it more times than I can count, can't wait to hear the whole album ❤
Better than that first garbage single they released. At least got some old funky Red Hot vibes.
Very funky monk Era reminiscent and i am here for it!!! And something about the chorus reminds me of the Beatles and i dig it
Essa banda é a melhor, nunca decepciona sempre lançando hinos
Watch the music video! https://youtu.be/Bzz5mtChw0g
I don't know why but this song reminds me...OHM!(specially guitar). In verse Walkabout, in chorus Melancholy  Mechanics ! It's great,great song  and beatiful  ending !😀
Lança esse álbum completo logo não aguento esperar minha ansiedade clama
Só os Br ouvindo 😎
Hbd Jhon 🎉🍻
cheio de conversinha
Fodaaaa
Zero defeitos.. 🥰❤💟
Que sintonia esses caras tem pra fazer música. Top demais!
Esses caras só surpreendem!!!!!AMO esse groove que só o RHCP tem!!!
Must listen with headphones, totally new song than listening with speakers.
Billy Joel "cant stop the fire"
we didn't start the fire ...chili peppers style
Coming right back into that key of fun 🤟💕
vasco
not digging this song much,black summer was great but this is kinda boring
https://youtu.be/BvooCkc1ilg .
Thanks!
Awesome as expected, the perfect formula reunited can never dissapoint !!
RHCP the greatest to ever do it!!!!
Co to kirwa jest
John Frusciante   05/03/1970   52 años
Judas Priest Has Whipped The Beast
Horrifying.
Yeahhhh I love this, really fresh, great song. One of my friends was saying how with black Summer she didn't feel the song was coming from a place where it was a true expression of who they are but I reckon she will have a different outlook on Poster Child...
WHAT A FANTASTIC SONG!
Long live the hottest peppers on earth!
Mcfly et carlito ?
strong Walkabout and Aeroplane vibes
They dtiched Klinghoffer for this ? Dark Neccessities and The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie have more groove and creativity than this...... I don't even know what to call this..... Kieids took incomprehensible gibberish to a new level.... They aren't writing another Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Californication or even Stadium Arcadium anytime soon....
Over five minutes and didn't go anywhere...
FUNKY!
It's funky and great!
Only comment. Fucking awesome
You know it's slappin' when you can't understand the lyrics 🔥 \m/
Flea's killing that's shit...
Nos aqui no Brasil amamos essa banda! E agora com o John de volta, tudo fica perfeito de novo !! ISSO É RED HOT !
Is he trying to be Eminem?
Still killing
Tony Flow is on fire¡¡¡¡¡¡🔥🌶🎧🎵🔊
Los red siendo los red
I love this one, reminds me a bit of stadium arcadium but it's also very fresh
Meh
cool lyrics and groove. bring on the funk! (hi, to soul mate ak)
Garbage. Hang it up
This fuckin rocks 🤘💀🤘
Que groove maravilhoso, RHCP simplesmente não decepciona, gosto de todos os álbuns sem exceção ❤️🇧🇷
man that sux

Damn, this is what I'm talking about 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love R.H.C.P !!!
Mitici ci vediamo a Firenze🔝🔝🔝❤️❤️❤️
this should be the Jojolion outro
From the first 2 tracks, this album is reminding me of Californiacation
Muitos brasileros comentam! Saudades desde a Costa Rica!
i love it fuck it. havent heard any funk this chill and smoothe for to long
Listening to this song again I think Anthony often gets unfairly criticized because of ‘bad’ vocals. There’s the funky backing and accompanying guitar lines, but his rap drives the song. For all his detractors: his ability and his voice define the Peppers’ sound a great deal.
ficou muito melhor que Black Summer manooo, um funk que tem a cara do rhcp
Los brazucas enfermos con los Red Hot !!! Meu Deus !!!
Suena bien pero es muy repetitivo.
Lovely funky.
Fckn’ AYYYY, they never stop coming with it, best band indeed
This song gives me porno vibes
Perfect Song to eat melting icecream under nuclearblast We all need funky grooves to heal🏵️🦋💗🍀🛸🙏
Sounds very familiar. The chorus melody does it for me. Goodie
dis... its not rhcp...its bllsht

This song is a masterpiece of art!
I saw Pearl Jam and Nirvana open for the Red Hots back in the 1990's. Yep. Really. But nothing has ever compared to the RHCP show I saw in a teensy club maybe 7 years prior, in the late 80's. The club had sound problems and they couldn't play for close to an hour. Crowd was getting impatient, drunk, and ugly. These were the days they performed in socks. Antony pulled out his left nut to entertain the crowd before they trashed the place. It worked and when the sound went back on they rocked the house with probably one of the most electrifying stage performances you could ever imagine. They played late to make up the delay and the crowd was so hyped up. It was utter madness. They've evolved so many times since those early days but their sound is always true to who they are. Love this. 90's revival in full force. If you like their music go see them live. I'm not sure you can experience the Red Hots fully until you see them perform in front of your own eyes. They're all incredible performers and Flea in his element is worth a whole other chapter. I bet they still rock it out. TBH it's probably better shows now he doesn't flash side junk as distraction. And in Antony's defense, he did obtain informed consent. I remember clearly he bellowed at the crowd, "I CAN'T MAKE IT GO ANY FASTER! WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, GIVE YOU MY LEFT NUT?!?!", and the crowd roared approval, so he obliged. Give em what they want, guys. Now & forever
i love the bass line, has anyone got the tab for it
Такое
John is back, funk is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love this band when Frusciante is in it, but I’m not digging any of the new songs. At all. Totally forgettable IMO. YMMV
Yes, i heard "Walkabout" on this too... XD
Desde Nicaragua viendo esta joyita
Yeah - Blood Sugar throwback - Excellent -
Unfortunately, I am with You and the getaway albums will be soon forgotten. Frusciante is just the king
They do what they do. Nothing much changes. Good though.
The song is awesome
Horrible esa huevada
Still there ❕ 😎🔥🔥🔥💣💥
Meh. Its alright. 🤷‍♂️ Music is nice. Vocals, not so much. Good luck.
I think we know which song Daniel Radcliffe's gonna memorize next
Wow.. crazy boring! Sounds like a loop. Disappointing
Can't wait to see the video for this song
Was just jokingly looking for that one vid of the guy making fun of RHCP, found out they’ve got new music
I think they’ve lost their fire. These singles have been very lackluster. I have not bought an album from them since By The Way and it looks like that streak will continue.
I wiiiiiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuuuu be
ahhh que música linda isso é a essência do Rhcp ❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
B🔥A🔥N🔥G🔥E🔥R
🦻🎵💪👍👍👍👍
Nostalgia
I Honestly don't see any diference between Josh and this new John´s era...... Is the same sh1t.....
#Brasil
Love hearing you guys back on rotation.
They are children of their Funky mother <3 Long live RHCP and Happy birthday to  Frusciante!!!
Oh Yeah!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!
Супер! В стиле перцев!!!👍
HOLY SHIT!!!!!! THEY ARE BACKKKKKKKKK! The chilis NEED John, it's the missing ingredient.  Sorry I am with you was fine. But  John is the man
Sobrino, sobrino 😎

Estoy ansioso por el nuevo album 😀😀 saludos desde chile 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
There are approximately 1,000,001 lyrics in this song
Walkabout 2022
Sounds like 311
Wow! Based off the comments it seems like Chili Peppers are huge in Brazil!
Beautiful ❤️

Aguante Los Red Hot💓💓nunca decepciona💓
Poster Child   Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell When someone heard a rebel yell I think it was an infidel Adam Ant and Robert Plant were center of a sycophant Used to buy Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant Islamabad is on the nod, Havana at the riot squad And if you want to be a Mod You'll have to meet me at the quad  You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low notе  Parliament's Atomic Dog that hats were filling up a fog Wе talk about the life and death of everything in analog The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin Lizzy lookin' mighty thin, the Thompsons had another twin I thought I won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like a pottery  I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight, ow La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum  A funky piece, the Sandinista, me and minor Mona Lisa Judas Priest has whipped the beast The mother love was named Teresa Bubble gum, I come bazooka, dirty dandy nana-looka Smoke banana in your hookah Now I know the band is ruca Bernie Mac and Caddyshack were dusty as the bric-a-brac And if you ask me for the time I'll tell you that the future's back  You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low note  Steve Miller and Duran Duran, the Joker dancing in the sand Van Morrison, the Astral man, the festival of hurricanes Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb Mc5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband Dairy Queen was on the scene on every preteen magazine The Motörhead and mystic queen, I must've needed Valvoline  I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum  You got me on this But then I can't get off With no one else but you You turn me on too Well, then I can't get up, ooh For no one else but you  Creem magazine, A Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean And now we know the Status Quo But God would never save the Queen Dave Mushegain, Copenhagen, copper goose of Ronald Reagan Dollar savers, Flavor Flav, the cosmic moves are power saving And my fist a double kissed unlisted number purple mist and Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist  You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low note  The waterbed was takin' meds, a beaver with the house of red A fatty for the natty dread, a pocket full of talking heads M.I.A.'s making paper planes, addiction to the days of Janes My stuff is made of purple rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane Giant squid, Karate Kid, Sid Vicious in the Katie-did The planet that we must forbid, the English speakers in Madrid  I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum
I may not understand a single word Anthony is singing but this song and his vocals still go hard asf
This is the song equivalent of a where's Waldo
Good tune but at least a minute too long.
i really enjoyed this, can't wait for unlimited love!
Uh soo goooooood ...those looong lazy bass notes aaaaarghh
Quero ver qual música será só no violão... John sempre faz uma versão só com violão em todos os álbuns
GOD
This is definitely what the world needs, only 🌶️ can deliver it.
The song takes you away with the whole beat & rhythm especially “Iiiii will be your poster chiilldd…” (head swings left &right). It motivates you for the day 😁 👏
Rhcp devuelta in the town
Que som incrível. Simplesmente magnífico.
Sounds like the old Big Mac song from back in the day. Now I'm hungry dammit.
God I love you guys.
Foda... show .. John na banda novamente é paixão e alegria..
Nunca fui a um show deles e a próxima oportunidade não perderei! É uma benção, ter nascido na mesma época da história que essas lendas vivem!
Most catchy and funky song I ever heard. 🤩
it really is the end of the world it is since 2000 years when jesus first came now is just at its peak, for god 1 thousand years is a second and a second is 1 thousand years!  the sign 666 will be keeping sunday as day of worship! you heared me right! the 4th comandement in the ten laws is keep my sabats ,that shall be a sign between me and you, it was refering to the jews, but the bible has 100 precent actuality and 100 precent do as god said no matter the times! the godgiven day of worship the sabath is saturday not sunday! sunday was the first day of the weak, vatican and the popes changed it , claiming they have is autorityn as the pope is god on earth, ruler of heavens earth and hell! now this is the bigest blasphemy somone claiming hes god!  the pope already met with all worlds leaders, political-religious-and the 1precent wealthiest people on earth the illuminatis A class luciferian puppets!  they met saying they discuss the climate change problem!  what happened when jesus was crucified  , saying that is better for one man to die than the whole people to be in disagreement,  this is text book what will happen these days, youl hear this soon enough,! as inflation and economy, the famens the climate calamities , wile keep growing in intensity, whatever they do it by harpp projects or some ar really god let to happen, as its all predicted in Daniel prophet and apocalypse! the fear the teror the need for a solution will expend, !   all this problems will be blaimed on those who refuse to worship sunday , the sign of the pope, and everything will be blamed on this few people who refuse to bow in front of vatican (sunday)! text book what happened with jesus will happen to those who refuse popes autority who claims he is god, and all this wrath is beacouse this public enemys refuse to listen to him!  but lucifer was defeated in heavens, was defeated at the cruce, and will be defeated in the end!  for those who understand jesuses died for all sins , and all sinners, no man is reedemed by his deeds but by gods grace, and the holy spirit who strenghtens those who care only about what the bible says , and refuse to worship a man given day! evrything is mad for people to be blind to this: "ego" "music" "brandi love", its all made to sell you a false sense of utopia and comfort, meanwille you neglect this most precious times ever on earth! whoever has bible questions, pls feel free tontext me!
Quanto comentário brasileiro <3
O Anthony cantando essa música ao vivo 🤣
Volta Josh.  Por favor , o mano volta quando quer pra banda e tal , gostei mais do antigo album.
John voltou com uma guitarra tímida né ?
They’ve definitely got their funk back, also known as John Frusciante.
Volta Josh.  Por favor , o mano volta quando quer pra banda e tal , gostei mais do antigo album.
Excelente canción! El funk de Red Hot a todo lo que da!! 🤘🏼👏🏼👏🏼👌🏼
Lyrically similar to Billy Joel's "We didn't start the fire"

Muito bom !!! Flea sempre com um ótimo trabalho foda de mais
Whoa the instrumentals during the rapping parts are really similar to Walkabout, from One Hot Minute! Minor irony there (would be nice if JF finally accepts that album as part of the RHCP story and plays the songs at future concerts).
Excellent song "...bum-bum-budum"
MY GOD 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
gay
Muito melhor que Black Summer. Lembra bastante a vibe do Mother's Milk.
I Love Red Hot Chili Peppers
EU AMO ESSA BANDA 💕💕💕📸
Frusciante here sounds like Dave Navarro on Walkabout. I love this! Give OHM some love…
mercifully, we may avoid the onslaught of cover versions with this rapid spitfire gem.  folks are still gonna try...Hey look at me !! can't wait for 4-1
LOVE
I'm feelin the jam fellas.......oooooooooo yeeeeeeeah.......
Dam didn't know I missed that funky bass
Música 👎
I'm waiting for Anthony  to go right into we didnt start the fire

It's the gaps in frusciantes guitar
Two songs so far, it's not speaking to me, already raped a vocal melody from Goodbye Angels in this song. Fired Josh to make a turd with John, hope something off this album is good.
Nabung dulu buat beli album baru nih..
ficou muito loka *BRzada* tá em peso nos comentários!!!
Listening to this for the second time while smoking a joint, just after a workout and the sun's blazing today which is a change here in Ireland! I love this track so much and that outro is MUAH! ✌👌
O verdadeiro funk rock raiz, feliz demais com os sons novos, esse álbum vem animal, só por sair logo dia 01, nice! 🙏🏼 🎧🎧👏👏❤🎼🎵🎤🎚🎛🎙🎶🎵🎼
Wow ...so funky..the way Anthony strings the lyrics together is amazing...what a fantastic song, really looking forward to the new album 👏👏👌
Jesus loves you and He died for your sins
This is so good
2:51 is this a referance to the legendary british rockband Status Quo?
Mais uma nova 🎸🔥🔥😃
Como o vinho RHCP só melhoram com o tempo! 👏🏾👏🏾❤
This is b-side level comon….
Anthony...Are you confident that you won't forget the lyrics..?

Who is still listening to this in 2022 ?
hilom ra kaayo Frusciante diri bai. Maka kurat pero hilom ra. We dig it
Just awesome ☺️
so parece mais uma musica do stadium arcadium, que decepção...
Sounds like if an AI made an rhcp song
I'm so glad they are making new music, I love black summer and then after hearing this song I love them both 😍
is this anthony's fastest rap verse yet? hope he wasn't wearing a shirt
Resumindo: a banda terá um grande sucesso novamente, em breve!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷
The whole band changed when John came back. Shows how much he played a vital role with the boys. You can hear John's electronic influence so heavy. Kinda like some Gorillaz vibes.
Fuck with it 🔥🔥
I absolutely love RHCP but this and black summer are more than underwhelming.  Not good
Now I know why there’s no lyrics in a lyric video.  🤣
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!  John turns me on!
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Them boys done did it again!
♥️♥️🇧🇷
Aaaahh, fazia tempo que eu não ouvia uma música do Red Hot que eu realmente gostasse! Gostei dessa: menos melódica, menos backing vocals do John, mais ritmada... carrega uma vibe do Californication e do Freaky Style! Espero que as outras tenham uma pegada mais assim!
Sounds like something from One Hot Minute
Cara de música "Lado b"
Brabo demais
Anthony lost his Irish account!
😍♥️
Dude! They are back!!!
Gotta say, while cool, not my favorite. Just not much musical change or interest after the first minute, just bores me.
je vous aimes depuis toujours (depuis Blood Sugar Sex Magik et j'ai 43 ans ..)  , malgrés les tempêtes ,je suis toujours résté fidèle , mais là ! c'est quoi cette soupe ?!?   Please !!!
最高！😄
Seeeeeeeeeeeeeee ♥
Essa música é igual vinho. A cada escutada fica melhor!
head bangers....pure fire !!!!
FUCK YEAHHHHHH
watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlqOV6nyJOY
👌🤙🤙 it’s perfect !
これぞレッチリ！ ジョンのギターだ
Reminds me of the Vibe of Billy Joel “We Didn’t Start the Fire” vibe
Nice song to listen while skating
This is exactly what I was waiting for 😍
walkabout vibes
Words can't describe how excited iam for the album
dark necessities, my favorite
Mjito bom pqp
Carlito où es-tu ?
not bad, but you can do much better
ciao
Can we just talk about those lyrics too, absolutely insane writing from Kiedis, back to his best!
meh
Melhor de todos os tempos. RHCP ♥️
Aaaeeyyy
RHCP uma de minhas bandas preferidas desde os 7 anos de idade.
Depois de ouvir Black Summer eu fiquei com as expectativas bem baixas por ser uma música bem genérica e sem sal, mas felizmente essa aqui melhorou bastante o nível, se o album novo seguir numa crescente a partir de Poster Child, pode ser um ótimo album.
Funk is in the air
I’m guessing this will be one of those songs where AK loses his place in the lyrics when they do it live. But we will still love him
A MELHOR BANDA DO MUNDO, DE VOLTA! BRASIL FELIZ
God how I missed this guitar
AMOOOOO RHCP!!!!
New? But it’s old too!!! very good!! I can’t stop my dance!
Rolaaaaaaaaaaa
These guys are the real deal!  Every time they get together magic happens ❤️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Can't wait to June and see them live in Seville (Spain). Hope Anthony memorizes this lyrics in time.
It's RHCP's response to It's the End of the World as We Know It and We Didn't Start the Fire
The Lyrics to this song are amazing. So many musical references.
Maravilhoso esse som, parece sons da época do one hot minute tipo a melancholy mechanics.
A banda que não tem uma música ruim, gênios ❤️
One Hot Minute vibes in the verses
Definitivamente el mejor tema en años. Estos tipos rockean que da miedo. Frusciante es de otra dimensión. Es un tema de esos que ya no se escuchan y me encantó. Sin dudas se convirtió en uno de mis favoritos de forma instantánea. Sras y sres. Frusciante is in da house!
Loved RHCP growing up, but Keides is a terrible frontman. No growth. Just gimmie an album with the band, I don't need talk rhyme
Gotta say I don't like this one as much as black summer. Great to have John back though! Been missing his input badly! ♥️♥️
VEM PRA O BRASIIIIL SAIO DO RIO GRANDE DO NORTE ATÉ O SUL SE VIEREM PLSS
Is this a B-Side song?
I loved black summer. But this ones really rocks! Ladys and gentleman, John Frusciante is back!
Hbd John we are birthday twins ❤️
Incredible Song love you guysss
This song gives me the sunset sleeps vibes
I'm in the rhcp tunnel yet (again) with this song. loviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3
I love it! Sounds like their older stuff from the ’80s and early ‘90s
2:26 Kiedis sounds like the 90's
Suena a Walkabout
Anthony giving Busta Rhymes a run for his money
Essa música parece uma da Cassia Eller : Meu mundo ficaria completo com você. :)
Escuto RHCP desde meus 4 anos, hoje com 22 digo com toda certeza, não existe música ruim dessa banda!!!
Sonzera que só vem mesmo desses monstros incríveis feliz demais por ouvir John motherfucker frusciante e esse vocal incrível Anthony kiedis arrebenta a banda eh foda parabéns e feliz demais por ouvir novas músicas i love red hot Chili peppers
Salve! ✌🏻🤘🏻
Mannnnn this is funky. I can just picture myself making love to it on repeat.
Fine wine ages like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 😎💖💖💖
Shades of 'Walkabout'....strangely. Love it though 🙏
Finalmente os Chilli Peppers estão voltando às suas origens! Espero um dia ainda poder ter a chance de ve-los Live!
The FUNK IS BACK!
Red Hot tá de volta, meu povo! Que momento pra se viver!
red ho representa demais!
Love this song. Maybe Rick Rubin was teasing us, saying the new album sounds like SA. I'm a big fan of the earlier albums, especially BSSM. And so far Black summer and Poster child sound to me they are going back to their roots a bit. Not as raw but super funky. Some parts of Black summer remind me of Under the bridge and Poster child gives me some freaky styley/if you have to ask/sir psycho sexy vibes. Thank you RHCP for this new music.  We all needed it. Can't wait for the album.
Amazing ❤❤
melhor que a anterior...muito boa!
I liked black summer better but this is still great
MAIS UMA, PORRA! 🤟
Ya quiero verlo a Tony cantándolo en vivo. Un reto.
JOSH, come back bro!
Anthony Kiedis + Flea + John Frusciante +  Chad Smith + Cory Henry  ❤ The RHCP Megazord has finally been completed!
So good!!😎
They brought the funk with this one
Mano! na moral, a volta do john deu outro nivel a banda a musica tem vida. i love rhcp
Klinghoffer era was better. BSSM excluded
Where's the guy in the comments with the lyrics for this one
Se existem defeitos, eu não vi. ❤️
🤩🤩🤩
love from hungary <3
If anything off the new album is played live I'll definitely be taking a piss break
Some GOOD music !!! 🌶❤️‍🔥🌶❤️‍🔥🌶
😍😋
I'm 16 years old and have been listening to RHCP for like a month. They are one of the few artists whose songs I can listen to all the time and I don't know why but I feel like I've known them for years. I am happy and excited about the new album. They have been making music for the past 4 decades without losing their authenticity and that says a lot about them.
After black summer, this is so beautiful
Que buen tema, los chilli peppers nunca decepcionan
This will be a mad outro jam live!!!!
Foda dms hein
Love the flow
جمدان ياعم الحج
so sick!
beer and rhcp is an amazing combination! Cheers
Dirty Funk by the legends never smells unwelcome! it'z too lovely and funny
RHCP 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Omg❤️ RHCP never disappoints
O Red Hot está no meu top 3 de bandas, pela ordem Iron Maiden, Red Hot e Strokes. A volta do John vai fazer e ir no show deles novamente, fui na época do Josh. Mas o que também me feliz, fora a volta do John, foi a volta do Rick Rubin. Pra mim de longa o melhor produtor musical. Todos os álbuns que curto pelo menos 80% ele participa: System of a Down Toxicity, Audioslave, Slipknot... Entre outros, e por ter revivido o Strokes, esse último álbum tá incrível!!! Red Hot voltou!!!
nice one! there's a certain "walkabout" vibe, doesn't it?
I know that's not possible, but I want Deborah Chow to direct all the videos for this album, just like she did "Black Summer"! Plus...oh man the sound of this album is vintage RCHP and that is meant as a most definite compliment! Well done boys!👍👍👏
Intro bass line is so cool...!
Esse novo álbum do RHCP tá ficando muito show.
Nenhuma surpresa: música boa demais!
nice funk.Just wish they can rap on some songs like old times
High class funk
HOT DAMN THIS SONG IS AWESOME
O melhor é imaginar essa belezinha sendo tocada ao vivo por eles, essa musica tem espaço pra improvisos do John e sabemos que ele vai usar muito bem isso 🌶🔥
chaDD...... in questo brano non ha usato i crash....interessante!!
かっこいいわー
I like both songs :-) , I hope we get songs a bit more By The Way album, like Venice Queen etc. Still looking forward to everything
That bass sounds so good! never get bored to those silence and mutes between the notes <3
Frusciante's mixing and synth (not to mention funk) fingerprints are all over this. The rhythm and groove is sooo tight. (Most bands will spend their careers trying to be so in sync)  I don't often praise AK but he killed this one.
cool song of guitar
Lotta lyrics for AK to forget here. Idk if will be a live "staple" lol
love it!!! such a great tune! you guys never disappoint :)
What's funny is THIS (Official Audio) video is WAAAAy better than that fake green screen, star wars horseshit they paid millions for.
B side do Californication
o hino porraaaaaa 🖤
this is soo RHCP
❤️, c u in Toronto
Comment il fait ce son à la guitare. On dirai le debut d'une sonnerie de téléphone.
uma banda que há 23 anos  faz parte da minha vida!!
Que música boa 😍😍😍😍😍
Essa música me traz uma vibe! RHCP 🖤🌶
Good!!
Szczęki opadają 😁 zajebioza
Nice one... Old days back... There's a glitch at 4:06 please do correct it.
Due singoli atomici......meravigliosi come sempre ci vediamo a Firenze cazzo dajeee
No começo parecia ruim, no fim parecia que estava no começo.
Feliz ao ouvir RHCP na sua mais pura essência novamente. Ansioso pelo lançamento completo do novo álbum. 🇧🇷✌️😎
ブラッドシュガーセ○クスマジックみたいで最高。
Sounds like Ian Dury & The Blockheads
Слава Україні!
I'm not glad, but it sure seems like I'm going to be saving some money by not having to buy this cd.
LOVE that bass!
Venham para o Allianz Parque em São Paulo
❤️❤️❤️🤟
No wonder Anthony always forgets his own lyrics when playing live concerts. Look at how he screws himself with lyrics the size of a Bible. Like with the poem at the end of She Looks to Me.
Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
Geniaaal, me gusta mucho
Damn, boy, i like this son from the start to the very end. so freaky style, so funky. love it.
Muito foda, curti demais, foi na essência da banda, esse álbum promete demais, vida longa ao RHCP, vida longa ao John Frusciante na banda!!!
Look like new/old guitar is Novarro 😂 Where is John sound ?
Perfect ❤
RHCP nunca decepciona! 🤘🏼❤️ Mesmo q eu prefira a black Summer, essa não ficou muito atrás. Foda!
That sounds like a One Hot Minute b-side.
Ребятки Перцы🌶, мы ждём хитов.  Хотя бы парочку, таких как Californication или By the way 🎸 Пока 2 трека, лично меня не зацепили.
Buena canción para estar con un buen cocktail en un buen club
Melhor banda do mundo!!!!
Super talented Kiedis!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
From what I've heard so far, this album is going to be a massive flop.   This is coming from a RHCP fan of 20+ years.
there's huge sir psycho sexy vibes
Love it. More sophisticated, layered and consummately played compared to Walkabout. Great musicianship. Super Excited for the new album.
chilis gives me chills ❤️❤️❤️
Aguante los red hot🤴😎
😘
BSSM vibes. I like it.
Ever since  that double album it's been downhill ..by the way was the last good album..I'm glad there still making music  for themselves but this is pedestrian and boring
Muito legal essa música! Venham para Osasco, São Paulo/BR
LONG LIVE 1991!!!!

That's it, That's the song i've been waiting for for 16 years. Awesome
Sou apaixonado com essa banda , o que mais acho legal dessa nova música é as referência a algumas músicas brasileiras...
Grande Anthony, recitando a lo loco jaj! No veo la hora de verlos ya!
uraaaaa🔥
What is this RUBBISH ??? WTF happened to RHCP?

Mood of lost child
This song make me remember "walkabout" One Hot Minute....... 😌😌😌
Nice! actually reminds me of 'Walkabout'
I can't wait for the next 14 masterpieces!!
Pretty flow, pretty nice. Can't wait to june. Hope the World War Three starts on july at least...
Great Song! Love your tight and groovy bass lines, Flea. RHCP are still a musical  funkmaster powerhouse 🎸🤓🤩 Pure Honey🐝
RHCP ❤ u from 🇮🇩

Hermosa la voz de Anthony😍
The ending of the song has the atmosphere of the song Dark/Light of Jonh album Empyrean
We must be the luckiest fans in the world ❤️🌶
Somewhere Em's sweating
Am I the only one who's reminded of Aeroplane when I hear this? I think it's the dreamy sort of chorus, gives me Aeroplane vibes
4:32 Olha eu imaginando o jhon puxando isso ao vivo 😍
We didn't start the fire... it was always burning since the worlds been turning...we didn't start the fire...etc
Me: God this groove is too fuckin good.  John: I know
Brilliant, just brilliant! Chillies never cease to amaze me! ♥️♥️♥️
Que grandioso tema, muchas gracias por tanto ☺️🙌🏻👏🏻
RHCP bringing the funk and 70’s vibes on this one. Love how it sounds.  If only we could get some younger successful bands doing something this good.
A identidade funk do RHCP
Happy Birthday John Frusciante!! 🥳💕
Everyone: the rap is dead. Anthony:
Top 10 rapers Eminem is too afraid to diss
Let’s fucking goooo chili’s yup ouvehhhhh
Abstract horrid bs at every base beat, why would you do this to me? I was a person that lived in Cali to first hear your music, loved the evolution, this is bad, why? Do better, please!
Alright, bout time 70s porn music became popular!
liked black summer more than this because to be honest i like the mote guitar heavy era of rhcp. this song is good in its' own right and sounds like the old stuff they put out. cannot wait for the album and i hope there will be a good balance between their old and new styles
Damn this is old school as hell and funky, I'm loving it. Anthony, have fun singing this live lol. 🤣🤘
RHCP are one of the, if not THE, greatest band of all time.
Living fossil
Horrible vocals
bro got a stroke 💀
Ребята как всегда сделали максимально круто!! Жалко, что без клипа, но тут можно понять. Ещё один классный сингл в своем неповторимом стиле! Так держать!! Очень жду альбом и надеюсь что он выйдет в России в одно время со всем миром, несмотря на все обстоятельства.
Estamos sedentos por músicas novas e boas!! Só mesmo RHCP !!
Why is not the same video than official video on Facebook?
Black summer and this one give me stadium arcadium vibes
cool song wish tix prices were not a fuc#in joke....another show i will be missing....got the dough just ain't worth it.... what the F?

Bem familiar, mais alguém achou semelhante a Scar Tisue? Gostei muito 👏👏👏
Olm çok iyi yaa
I absolutely love this song already,It's like they've never been away from making music ,I started liking their music when I watched my dad's slane castle DVD In 2016 whilst I was recovering from major hip surgery and It had pictures at the back of the DVD case and my dad looked at the case with me and Introduced the band members one by one,I will never forget that Thursday afternoon In April 2016 ❤ I also share a birthday with John F so I'm the luckiest person ever 🎂 I'm 15 years old today 🍰🥳🎉🎉🎉
the weirdest RHCP song, but I love though
Poster child is groove! And blows me away! Thanks! 🤸🏼‍♂️
Amazing RHCP funky style
I've been waiting soooo long to be funked this good....da Boyz r back ✌️❣️🌶️
Kind of Walkabout flavor in a more Frusciante style
Omg!!!!! Am I dreaming 😹😹😹😹😹😹 ??? So cool and refreshing!!! Red hot forever!!!
This level of funk just calls for some slap bass!
What a great bass base! So awesome!
Arriba los Chillies por siempre! Excelente canción, no puedo esperar que salga el álbum 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
The special morocco lally bounce because probation parallely store inside a taboo grill. tender tense, stupendous dog
Uau já é um clássico
heheehehhe
sensacional
New song
Hehehehehehe
Forever RHCP
Waiting for hits!
Mmm
Nem tinha visto a música nova!!! Que vibe incrível 🤩
I just keep coming back. Thank you so much for staying committed to your style, to your art and to your fans. I dunno…I feel we were considered when these songs were made, something that is no longer the case with the “stuff” they call “music” these days…
Blood Sugar Sex Magic vibes for sure
Listening to this I also realized how much I missed John's backing vocals 🤩
I just hope this is some weird joke and that these B sides songs are actually not on the album.
I can hear a bit off the b side Domino in the vocal melody. Great song.
Walkabout del disco One Hot Minute????¿?
Very Walkabout feelings!
Walkabout??
Funk 🥰🥰🥰👋👋👋🇭🇳🇭🇳🇭🇳🇭🇳
BR NO TOPO 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Nothing like Flea laying down some great Funky Bass lines!!! R.H.C.P. Will ALWAYS be my all-time favorite band!!!!! I freaking LOVE you guys SOOO much!!!! I can't wait for their new Album to be released this April, only a little over 3 weeks left to wait for it!!!! Although I am even more excited to come and see you guys live this August!!!! This will be my 5th consecutive tour that I will attending, I'm still in disbelief/bummed that you guys actually skipped coming to Portland, OR this time around, in fact, I don't believe that has ever happened before, but I'll still be completely ecstatic watching you perform up in Seattle, WA, it will totally be worth the drive up North!!!!!  💜💜💜🌶🌶🌶💜💜💜
Legend back
This album feeling slightly underwhelming. Not here to slurp ya cocks.
This song is such a fucking jam at 1.5x speed seriously.
A little one hot minute album vibe on this one
Es una locura escuchar con audífonos. Increíble producción.
the song is great, it's nice to listen to it while drinking a beer in a bar in Antalya ❤️🌶🇹🇷
What a basic bitch of a song.
Welcome back ..DO NOT FUCK THIS UP ANTHONY
What the heck...
Happy Birthday john 🎉❤️
I was going to comment that they've never lost it, but it feels like they're only getting better! It's insane how they keep performing time and time again.
Not really into this one, one of there weakest, seems like there trying to go old school, when personally there songs where at there strongest around californication, by the way era
Where's music video?
Hey guys, just Wanted to share my thoughts to this song: you are making music now for decades (so Sure you grew older) BUT YOU DO NOT SOUND OLDER! (like Some other Bands Do much earlier) and I think That is the most Beautiful of you! You are staying the same without repeating yourself. I am looking forward to your Album, this might  have the potential to be my Album of the year 😊
This is what I needed to hear!!! Love this this freaking song
30 years later and still authentic asf 👌
Ok, if this is the best they can do with John back they should have kept going with Josh... My opinion....
Adrenochrome user’s just listen to Californiacation
Yes baby!
Okay...so when "Black Summer" was released I was still on the fence. But this....THIS SONG IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. SO FUNKY, SO FRESH. SO THEM (RHCP). The Force is strong with this single which can only mean one thing...This new album is going to bring so much light, happiness and positivity  into my life, and it couldn't have happened at a better time. It's been a terrible year for me battling depression...yet gratefully my higher power has blessed me with this band and their new album  just at the right time! Thank you John F. Chad S. Anthony K. Flea a.k.a Micheal B.
Obgd por estarem aqui & Agora❤️🔥👏
Life is a Rock vibes
✳️
Как-то простенько и на Перцев не похоже.
Bro is this blood sugar sex magic 2?
Walkabout
Happy birthday, John!
Love this! Sounds like a bssm song!

Come to Brazil
Love this song!!! ❤️
I missed these guys. Hope you guys get immortal
Kinda going in a Blur, Talking Heads, Jack Johnson direction. I dig it
This feels like the spiritual successor to walkabout
NEW RHCP LETS GOOOO
Like most of their songs, it would be a lot better without Anthony's vocal. Also, it's very-very strange to hear John undeniably copying a song he never ever heard. Black summer was way better imo.
I'm proud to hear this 👏 ❤
This gives me a Chili Peppers 80s vibe for some reason
Nice
Do you hear the background chatter during the bridge? Reminds me of the end of 'If You Have to Ask' off BSSM
This is the peppers we all love , new album wil be great 💪🏻
that bass line 🤯
Avisa que sao eles
sounds like one hot minute ❤️❤️❤️
I didn´t like Black Summer that much, but this one, damnnn, sexy as fuck
Red hot em sua essencia! Mais um grande trabalho! Te amamos RHCP!
"We didn't start the fire...."
Será imposible cantar esta canción :) es una maravillosa versión moderna del clásico funky style de los Red Hot. Súper contagiosa.
De pire en pire...!!!! burk!!!!
One Hot Minutesque.
Reminds me of 'Walkabout.'
RHCP rocks forever 🤘
This is totally gonna be the backdrop and I can’t wait. September can’t come soon enough!
I love Red Hot Chili Peppers unlimited! 😊🎸🎧🎵♥️
I don’t think the song is good
mimimi, não gostou, foda-se!     O que faz eles serem foda é esse som aleatório,  SPEED FLOW FODA Anthony
Does poster child refer to the girl on OHM or The Getaway?
It's a really interesting and fresh song. A perfect blend of their early and last catalogue. I can't wait to hear the new album ! 🤘
*Essa música é simplesmente pavorosa, um pastiche dos 3 primeiros albums do rhcp, até os fãs mais idiotas estão decepcionados. Tadeu, Regis (em breve)*
I met the Peppers before they were really famous at a small gig in Reno and they were so ahead of their time and crazy cool !!!! Especially Flea , hes a GENIUS!
Falling in love with you guys all over!
Ohhh the goovie funky goodness...
I fucking love this song
Huge fan....but this song should have been left off the album.
walkabout 2022
Perfect "come here baby" song
😍😍 I can’t wait for the rest of the album
Happy Birthday John.
...how are they going to play this live? 😂
I can only imagine Rick Ruben witnessing this manifest infront of him for the very first time... must've been a heavenly experience 😌
this is so funky omfg
FUNKY
Jddbsndnsnsns
Brasil representando MUITOOO
Compare that to their jam when Trump was around. What a joke.
Disappointing to say the least. I don't know if it's a lack of drug use that has been influencing this type of writing but this isn't very acceptable considering the bands musical track history with John. I love every RHCP album starting with out in LA but this is so far the worst chilis album I've heard. And yes the Klinghoffer albums are better in my opinion so far. And certainly Navarros one hot minute is way better! I hate to say this guys.
I can smell the Los Angeles air at sundown off of this song. Bravo RHCP
I really expected more from John's return... but I'm a bit disapointed. Just my worthless opinion tho. Don't get me wrong, John's work is good in this, but there is something about the song as a whole that just does not work for me
It's a song with edges, not polished .. nice
Funkiest the chilies have been in quite some time.
Que música top
that song is not good i am sorry
Pretty sure it takes Navarro Josh & John to Complete this one on Guitar.          Horny.
I do not imagine antony kiedes singing this with out lyrics. This will be a funcking mess on live.
Good enough song but doesn't sound like a single.
imagino essa musica em algum game, filme ou serie. QUE MUSICA BOA DA PORRA
I have 14 chili peppers tattoos. And Followed multiple tours throughout the U.S. this should be the single. Bring it back. And let froosh shine.
TTR!!!!!
Imagino jogando um Gta e ouvindo essa música na rádio, e também consigo imaginar muito bem em um filme, por algum motivo acho muito cara de filme da Disney
Ima hit a bar this weekend idk where. Should be in the jukeBOXox So I press play.
just rad
the funky monks return...
Cool song
I'm not advertising.
🤔 oh ooh who will have my beautiful problem child OOO.. 🤑
Ох как надо! Первая хорошая новость, за последние две недели! Всем мира ✌️ it’s perfect! First good news for a two weeks! Peace for all! ✌️
Come on guys!! You should include Latin America in the tours.
Right on! Tear it up!
Also, ya'll youngins don't even know the artists he's fuckin naming off! ABSOLUTE LEGENDS!!
Met them all apart from John roll on June ✊☮️🙏
Woah I was a little bit unsure about the new album after that first awful release.. never thought I’d say those words considering they’re my favourite band but black summer was really no good.. especially Anthony’s part
Best chill song ever lol
Cool video
The faces I see em.
El tema tiene algo de los temas de Blood Sugar Sex Magic, quizás algo de The Power of Equality. El último minuto del tema es genial.
Noice
Oh so these niggas just gonna drop absolute FIRE on us in 2022. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😎
😁
Hell yeah this is so funky! The RHCP sound that I grew up with
Hang loose emoji thumbs up emoji peace emoji
The toughest rhythm section damn near ever, they’re undefeated
Killin it
The heart on Washington
Remind me of the days when every song on one record could be a hit single.
I wonder who face to face
Killer song
No me gustó😐
Ain't it crazy
❤️🥺 soy feliz por deleitar a mis oídos con sus maravillosas canciones
❤️❤️🔥🔥
Rapaz, groovão!
Não paro de ouvir essa música, Frank do Red hot chili peppers voltou
John was exactly what they needed to breathe new life I to their familiar sound.
this song sucks lol
chulada de rola
Incrível! Vem pro Ceará!
I thought this was gibberish.
💪👍🤝
Heard it 5 times in a row
Anthony Keidis singing this live but forgets the lyrics... genuinely curious how he can muble his way around it!
Chill
✅
JoJo?
Escuchar rock nuevo, de está calidad y de estas leyendas en estos tiempos es un regalo para nosotros, gracias Chili Peppers 🤟
Glad to hear their funk sound again.
So far both songs awesome
Let’s go RHCP
Can't wait to listen to the whole album this song has vibes from on hot minute aeroplanish vibes
meo tema ctm
xq los comentarios son puro portugues
Can u feel it guys? The flow... Im High right now..... ✨✨❤❤
Nobody's talking about the video itself. Very cleverly done and appealing to the eyes. Bravo. I can tell they really love neon signs btw. Go Robot has a shot that reminds me a bit of this new album logo.
wow, Freaky Styley vibes
RHCP are sublime
Funk me up! Such a good song
RHCP Voltando com toda sua essência. Ansioso demais por esse novo álbum! ❣
Beautiful :'<
I can imagine that Anthony is forgetting lyrics already
O Groove do baixo tá tão forte que vibrou meu celular mais senti falta de uma maior presença da guita do John talvez aqueles solos de fechar os olhos e brizar de resto esse som tá na mesma vibe do Getaway
Reminds me of Walkabout.
Reminds me of Walkabout.
Only Anthony can sing the complicated lyrics in such funky ways.Excited to listen this full album soon.
Não tem como, os cara são fluente na arte de fazer música boa 😎❤️
最高だぜ！
Psycho sexy !!!
❤️🌶🔥⭐️✌️
not saying its a bad thing but this song confirms my theory that Anthony Kiedis loves the sound of his own voice which isnt as beautiful as he'd like to think (still a fan and have been since the 80s)
Hail to the loong lyrics of anthony
Red hot chilli peppers never fails to amazes us.
worth it
❤💯🔥🌶✳🔥❤👏👏👏👏👏
aahahhahahahahahahha
😍😵🥴💗💗💗💗
SOUNDS AWESOME
Епифанцеву понравилось бы)
Welcome back John!!!
Bem vindo novamente John Frusciant
Fico imaginando como vão ser os shows deles, vai ter que  ser no mínimo de 5 horas. So faz músicas boa!!!
This is groooovy gravy
Walkabout pt.2 is born. And people say One Hot Minute was no good and doesn't have the "chili's sound".LMAO, one of the best albums they got IMO. That said this is a great little jam, and I am HYPED to see them live this summer. BEST BAND ON THE PLANET.
Oh Snap! The lyrics and harmony, yo...🤙🏽💗🎶!!! ("Giant Squid & Karate Kid"..."The 70's was such a win"?) #PureGenuis #FunkyFresh
wb yall
Remember the "Love Buzz - Nirvana".
Música q logo em breve o Anthony vai errar a letra kkkkkkkk❤️
Faltou o comentário do maior fã de RHCP. Funkyzão gato negro
🇧🇷
This sound reminds me of one hot minute album love it❤❤❤❤🥰
So far Im so happy about this new album, feels back like original Chili Peppers, not like their last few years...
sounds like one hot minute  ironically
Well they know what coming, don't they. The symbolism speaks volumes in this video.
Again and again and again
Sounds like "one hot minute" track
Yes! That’s the stuff. 👨🏻‍🦰🥇
アルバム楽しみにしてます🎶
There's no denying that's a Flea bassline
Anthony sometimes forgets his lyrics live this would be a nightmare for him 😂
Llke sly and familystone
Getting major getaway vibes from this
Not liking it... Sounds annoying.
Gracias x la magia John!! De veraa q me llenaste un gran vacio, por siempre RHCP. el Chili de Lugano
Incrível.
Mt bommm
can u imagine this *LIVE* ?  super sic !!
Who knew a jojos stand can make some killer music
🔥
Its sounds fresh and reminds me of older days.
😍
I'm beginning to feel like a rock god rock god!
This is so fucking good
Ugh.. red hot garbage.  I had my hopes up 😣
Yassss! This is fire!
esta muy bonita me gusto, los Peppers ya, son santidades de la música ya, no se les puede exigir mas son tan buenos que son leyendas, los amamos.
Chili Peppers Vive! 🇧🇷
it would take an entire dissertation to describe the pleasure i feel from this masterpiece.
Mais uma ótima música pra conta ❤
I will be your poster child tonight 🎶
The last two songs they have released are absolute trash
Klinghoffer was not the problem
Realmente se parece muito com a walkabout do one hot minute.
This is such a trip Such  a funkkkky throwback
I’m ready for Unlimited Love to drop! Black Summer and Poster Child are so good ❤️🌶🎶
♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️
Thumbs down  Since nobody can see the count, they can at least see mine
Welsome  !
Que vibe de som 🔥❤️
Yesss.... I been waiting so long!💕😍🤤
Yeah!
Interesting sound.
Serious "Walkabout" and "Falling Into Grace" vibes -and I just played the album with Dave earlier today. That is a little surprising since the band tends to ignore this era (admittedly for good reason).
This song is a good example of my love/hate relationship with RHCP. I hate the Rappy, Funky stuff. I love the melodic Rock stuff i.e. Scar Tissue, Soul To Squeeze, Californication, etc.
Reminds me why I started and still am playing the bass! Flea is the GOAT! Thank you for the gift of groove and funk!
This is more fun than Black Summer, but Black Summer is more of a radio friendly song
Walkabout vibes 😍🌶
Ez valami fergeteges album lesz úgy hallom az eddigi két dal alapján. Ekkora funky groove-ot már rég hallottam. Itt aztán van minden; megidézi számomra a Freaky Styley, a Mothers Milk és a By The Way korszakot, míg a Black Summer-nél a Californication éra jutott eszembe. Anthony szófordulatai és ez a pattogós ütem, amit Chad hoz elképesztő. John mintha vissza nyúlt volna egészen a gyökerekhez és Hillel előtt tisztelegne ezzel a gitározással, Flea pedig hozza a kötelezőt; bármihez alkalmazkodik vagy ötletet ad, szépen dörmög alatta végig. Ez a Chili album forró lesz, ahogy az a nevükhöz méltó! Peace, Love, Hungary 🇭🇺✌🏻💜🌶️
Oh... Bummer.
😍😍😍
To até vendo o Anthony errando essa letra ao vivo 🗣🗣🗣🗣
Ah amei essa nova música muito bem feita , vcs ainda manteram as músicas raiz
Much much better!
come to Brazil 🇧🇷
Love RHCP, but let's be honest this is kind of weak. I hope we haven't heard the best of this album.
the best band!
The singles are already on par, if not topping some of Stadium. You can hear how far, Flea and John have come with their side projects. Chad and Anthony kicked it super old school but with this super fresh feel. This album could be their best work. :) I'm so happy
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Passo mal se não ouço red hot durante o dia...muito bom vey, ótima música, sério :D
最高かよ👍
Gracias por nueva música para mis oídos. Me la paso escuchando todos los demás discos. Soy fan de Argentina. Suscribite si los Peppers te llevan a otro lado astral y bien funkyy
The outro is so perfect!
🖤❤️🖤 Yaasss!
Que música meus amigos que música 🤯 como tem gente que fala que red hot as músicas são todas iguais ? Slc
Just fucking beautiful!! I can't wait to hear this in the stadiums!!!! Mind blown 🍃🌬️
How when what? Yes!!! This track is just so nice. So great! Thank you!
1999 - morava na ZN de Sp, foi o ano em que conheci a banda. Eu tinha 11 anos, e passava as tardes jogando SNES.  Um dia na locadora, passou o clipe de Californication e desde então passei a curtir rock.  Três/quatro anos depois eu era adolescente, tocava guitarra e andava de sk8.  Graças a essas coisas passei a frequentar o centro de SP, rolês de SK8 e daí em diante a minha vida virou um turbilhão de sexo, drogas e muito rocknroll.  O rock mudou a minha vida e a porta de entrada foi o rhcp.  Seria impossível descrever aqui tudo o que aconteceu desde então.  Esses caras realmente mudaram a minha vida... Se eu não estivesse naquela locadora, naquela tarde, talvez hj eu seria outra pessoa kkkkk...
Anthony::rap+funky=legit💥💥
Walkabout revisited...
Travel to Stadium Arcadium
Funky vibes.Love it!
🌌❤️😎
oh fleaaa u killin me with that tone, hairy uncle
It's my birthday. this is the best birthday gift i could have asked for
Absolutelly FUNK
I love John Frusciante 💙
Awesome
I like it
Eu oro toda noite para uma música minha estourar, Sei que algum Dia Direi, Não Foi fácil, Mas Consegui 🙏🏽🙌🏽FÉ uma dia chega o dia 🤩🔊
Reminds me of walkabout, one hot minute.
el finaaal<233
Impossível não se emocionar ouvindo as músicas com a volta do John. Eu era muito novo na época do primeiro retorno, e agora finalmente estou acompanhando a história sendo escrita. Obrigado Josh pelos anos que você esteve na banda, seus trabalhos foram sensacionais e você me fez intensificar meu gosto pela banda, agora temos de volta Frusciante novamente mostrando o que faz de melhor, compondo músicas que eu automaticamente amo desde a primeira ouvida!   Obrigado pelos momentos felizes, Chili Peppers, eu amo vocês!!!
WOW. I love it! Come to Peru please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Musicar de provador da Renner mané.... curti demais
É um tiro atrás do outro, não aguento 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ELES NÃO ERRAM UMA!
Esto suena buenisimo
They will always have that signature sound that makes their music great
Quisiera ver a los Red Hot Chili Peppers de vuelta en México los amo
They finally enabled comments 😃
Flea chad John and kiedes are the best by the way your the best band ever
Unfortunately not crazy about this one.
Someone quick!  post the lyrics! This is pure fire ! 🔥
Acho que eu gostei mais dessa do que 'Black Summer', que musicão 🤩
this is so good I cant even express it. One hot minute is back!
Amazing song ❤ You guys never cease to amaze me... Thank U
Vai Brazilian
Walkabout!
Some songs are made specifically for Antony..only he can sing.
Awwwwee shit son
We  didint know it but we needed this,
Anthony the rapper is back!
Wow
Temazo de los RED pegadizo como debe ser
goooooooooooooooooooood men
funk！
The level of musicianship is amazing on this one. Anthony, Flea, and John are killing it and Chad just melts into the equation.
Walkabout 2.0, notes of "Detroit","Emit Remmus" and Faith no More!
Can we please make Veronica the next single please
Que bonito que suena ese funk me hace recordar a TheGateway
Just like AC/DC, they have a formula. This song should have been 2 minutes shorter.
RHCP en mi sangre, RHCP en mi vida ❤️
This song is growing on me the same way black summer did
Omg thank you so much this song is actually such a good song!!!
Love it
I love it so much, I can't sing it but that makes me want to sing it more.
THIS SUCKS 😇 THIS SUCKS THE ENERGY RIGHT OUT OF YOU, ITS A GOOD RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS SONG , SO FUNKY
Amazing how RHCP music makes me feel fuzzy and funky all at once…………………😁
Bangun tidur tiba tiba ada lagu baru 🌶️ 🇲🇨
Amo la nueva canción! 🌶️❤️
[Verse 1] Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell When someone heard a rebel yell, I think it was an infidel Adam Ant and Robert Plant were center of a sycophant Used to buy Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant Islamabad is on the nod, Havana at the riot squad And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad  [Refrain] You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low notе  [Verse 2] Parliament's Atomic Dog that hats were filling up with fog Wе talk about the life and death of everything in analog The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin Lizzy lookin' mighty thin, the Thompsons had another twin I thought I won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like a pottery  [Chorus] I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight, ow La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum [Verse 3] A funky piece, the Sandinista, me and minor Mona Lisa Judas Priest has whipped the beast, the mother love was named Teresa Bubble gum, I come bazooka, dirty dandy nana-looka Smoke banana in your hookah, now I know the band is ruca Bernie Mac and Caddyshack were dusty as the bric-a-brac And if you ask me for the time, I'll tell you that the future's back  [Refrain] You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low note  [Verse 4] Steve Miller and Duran Duran, the Joker dancing in the sand Van Morrison, the Astral man, the festival of hurricanes Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb MC5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband Dairy Queen was on the scene on every preteen magazine The Motörhead and mystic queen, I must've needed Valvoline  [Chorus] I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum [Bridge] You got me on this But then I can't get off With no one else but you You turn me on too Well, then I can't get up, ooh For no one else but you  [Verse 5] Creem magazine, A Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean And now we know the Status Quo, but God would never save the Queen Dave Mushegain, Copenhagen, copper goose of Ronald Reagan Dollar savers, Flavor Flav, the cosmic moves are power saving And my fist a double kissed unlisted number purplemist and Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist  [Refrain] You got the best of my loco I'll take the rest of your showboat You got the best of my Yoko I'll take the rest of your low note  [Verse 6] The waterbed was takin' meds, a beaver with the house of red A fatty for the natty dread, a pocket full of talking heads M.I.A.'s making paper planes, addiction to the days of Janes My stuff is made of purple rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane Giant squid, Karate Kid, Sid Vicious in the Katie-did The planet that we must forbid, the English speakers in Madrid [Chorus] I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight La-da-da-da, bum-bum-budum
It’s subjective of course so everyone’s entitled to their view but ... not loving it. Not the chills of old... or even any era. 15 seconds before the fade slightly redeeming. At this rate I’ll be hoping Josh comes back. I thought song 1 might be an aberration... clearly not.
Love the shouts outs to all the Historical Bands, Songs and Festivals.
Anthony rap like 16th beat flea slap bass
I can see them rarely playing this song live for the same reason Billy Joel doesnt perform 'We Didnt Start The Fire'. If you forget a line... there goes the rest of the verse. I like it though
Chilies are a vibe and this is it
A segunda q já não gostei
🤘
Buenardo
amor a primera escucha
make the tickets 50% cheaper and play twice the gigs xxx
You can bet all times Anthony sing this will be a distinct lyrics
Oh no, What the fcuk just happened? Kedis, did you just crash your surfboard... ???
Pode ter certeza que cada vez que Anthony cantar vai ser uma letra diferente
We get it.  You LOOOOOOOOOVE California...
that's more like it. original
Excelente,muy calamada como para ir por la tarde paseando en un carro
Everybody looking up lyrics while listening to this for more than 20 seconds
Hermoso.... Esperare las siguientes canciones.... Rhcp... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪
That bridge got me hooked! Frusciante's placement of notes is really interesting and groovy. Flea's basslines in the whole song are insanely good. Another wonderful song to listen to hundreds of times, thanks Chili Peppers!
I will be your poster child You know the world is ours for a little while And then I will be your poster child tonight
FUNK ❤️‍🔥
need more california 😆
Fuck the world tour. Ticketmaster seats are already bought by scalpers and bots. $585 for floor.  200+ nose bleeds.
Mais um grande som pra essa imensa galeria!!!
I can't dance to save my life but when I listen to this song, I can win dancing with the stars.
♥️♥️♥️
To all the naysayers I say nay funky as fuck thank you rhck
I remember back when I hear rhcp when i was 16 first. I'm 22 now. I'm still fan. and I'm so happy because I see John again.
I can't wait to hear these lyrics get mixed up live :D <3 Freakin' love it! They still got the chiillllfunk down! <3
QUEREMOS A LOS CHILLI PEPPER  !
Quente,quente,quente!
I really like this.  Strangely enough, it gives me One Hot Minute vibes.
I want that sign! Super excited for this album and this summer’s tour!
só tem brazuca aqui
Demasiado relajante que te transporta a otro mundo 🤯
Red Hot Chili Peppers Por Siempre 🇪🇨✳❤

Boring.   Maybe the melody could have more than two notes.

Black Summer em Época de Guerra e agora Poster Child . Isso mostra o quanto é bom relaxar ouvindo um belo velho novo Red Hot . Que o sucesso de vocês contamine quem precisa de boas energias ! A música cura a alma e o mundo !
eu amo essa banda e não é de hoje
ну наконецта 🤌🤌🤌 первая хорошая новость - так радостно в душе
I'm about a quarter into the song and I can tell you that the funk level has reached Intergalactic Heights
Que clase de walkabout es este?
I ABSOLOUTLY LOVE the "Billy Joel - We Didn't Start the Fire"/"REM - It's The End Of The World As We Know It" list style rhyme scheme 😍 Gracefully done x
Senti que black summer ta com a pegada da era Josh sabe, e essa com a pegada era blood sugar, tá muito interessante nem sei o que esperar dos outros sons agora
Very funky!
HINO!!!!!
The groove, the flow, the details. Best band ever
Im Brazilian, and love this band RHCP 🔥💥🚀🤘🏽
There better be a credit to Ian Dury on this one lol. Ripped right off.
Boa música, mas prefiro a vibe mais de Black Summer
I like this. It's not on par with their best songs though.
ufff, pinche temazo me despeino los pelos de los huevos de lo potente que esta
Cara, que som foda, vi mitos comentários falando sobre parecer walkabout, mas eu me lembrei mais de sexy mexican maid
Special vibes like always with RHCP. Greetings from 🇲🇦💕
Belongs on “Blood Sugar Sex Magic”
Los amo cabrones
Sensacional!!
Quero ver o Anthony K. cantar essa ao vivo hahaha
🥵🔥
LETS GOOOO!!!

Ну как говтрится: "Не зря, ждали"
Mano, esses caras são demais. RHCP minha banda favorita. John voltou com tudo
John Frusciante= Funk Machine
Só observo brasileiros aqui, A-M-E-I.
Oh boy
Queria saber a tradução
PEGAAAAAAAAA ! MANDA MAIS!
For the longest time (I'm not complaining), from 99' to when Josh was outs...most of the albums just sounded the same to me. This song blends the 90s and and all future albums together pretty well, and I'm absolutely excited for this album!!
Unfortunately Im not a fan of this song but its cool that a lot of you guys like it
Fleas bass riffs are so funky. like jazzy funk. Love it.❤👋🌮
Funk!! Lyrical Poetry!! Good Vibe!! And Love!! What more could we ask for??!! As Always...Love n Respect from the (505)!
WHAT DA FUNK
RHCP ainda groovando pra caramba. Mara demais. 💙
Dope!
Una súper mexcla entre Walkabout y algunas de las canciones de Funkadelic.😍
Da série: letras que o Anthony vai esquecer no show ao vivo kkkkkkkkk
Magnífico 🇧🇷
🔥🔥❤❤
Que ano bom pra ser fã do Red Hot meus amigos
Cómo siempre llegando primero
Walkabout?? Rsrs 🤭
Love the 2 new songs so far, but I hope the rest of the songs have John's vocals in it.. I miss his voice.
Essa música pedia um solo do John
Wasn’t crazy about the first song they released but I’d buy this! Fun Song
Tem um jeitinho brasileiro,  esta nova canção do rhcp
RHCP volta para o Brasil? Um grande abraço, Josemar de Paranapanema SP Brasil....
hmmm.. no
The final of this music is so fucking good ❤🎧. Thank you guys !
Thank you so much 🙏❤️ And thank you John for you’re welcome back, it was indispensable 🤗🤩 You’re like a good wine 🍷 😉
One hot minute vibes yesssss
A love letter to influential music :)
Que vibe sensacional ❤️‍🔥

Can't get into this. It's kind of annoying. Black Summer was alright though.
Grande fleaaa he aprendido mucho de ti, tengo 42 Años y te sigo hace buuuu creo desde los 10 años. Todas mis líneas de bajo en mi banda  tienen su su inspiracion Máster, Grande Red Hot.....
🤘🤘
<33
Mais uma fraca e repetitiva. Esperava bem mais desse album.
q merda
top de mais..... segura.. os meninos.... aqui e brasil.. aqui nos domina
my drunk driving theme song....very chill
Funk!
😎🤘
Ooo grandeee!!! Red hot... Saludos a todos desde Chile .. Gracias por existir......
Rick Rubin... On your feet master!
Magnífico! ♥️
🔥🔥🔥
Funk like craftsmanship.  Comfortable and unexpected.
This song grooves
THE OFFSPRING e Red hot Chili Peppers das antigas que ouço até hoje
I'm feeling some Gorillaz vibes here
Lol its crap xD
Melhor música do álbum novo depois de Black Summer 😎😂😂👍🇧🇷
This is BS! You should quit.
Jeeeezz.. that bassss.. I have to learn that!
Is this a good song ??? Mmm..... No.
I’ve invented Inward singing Kage!
I hate those people that say the chili peppers are three musicians and anthony. That is one hell of a voice
No me gusto, quiero a Jhon Frusciante desplegar todo su talento, se parece a los trabajos anteriores de los RHCP sin Frusciante.
Probably too much to hope for a double album like Stadium but that would be sweet if it’s more than like 12-16 songs. But this one is great too just like Black Summer
hell yeah man
Vengan a Argentina 😭❤
Love it.  Frusciante funk.
❤️❤️🤟🏼
Blood surges sex magic vibe. Feel like it will be a great jam song on tour. I see the thundercat influence
Red Hot Chili Peppers is my favorite band, it's amazing  with all the their songs are amazing
Sounds a lot like the instrumentals from Walkabout. But I dig it.
φανκίλα
Eu sabia que ia sair uma como essas
This would be so damn hard to sing live but would be so much fun to try hahaha
AAAAAAAA
Ok, flame me... I wonder if a reunion with Dave Navarro would of been a grittier/ better choice (OHM era).... Perhaps a future consideration?*   .... ( *next time JF quits)
Gotta say I’m a little underwhelmed on this one.
Oh man, it's been a while since I listened to We Didn't Start the Fire
Как будто потерянная песня из старых альбомов)
this is pure funkyness , amazing
Love me some dorian baby
OS CARA É VENENOSO DEMAIS
horribles, mejor matt bellamy
Red Hot Chillli Peppers are still going strong like they just started
That's the best tune they've released in 20 years
❤️Love it❤️super funky, triple entendre lyrics, combines past&present, it rocks!❤️
Esto es espectacular, no soy un gran fan pero creí que habían dejado de hacer música, pensé que era un remáster o algo, genial canción
I think i'll go on a walkabout...
Parece Gorillaz kkkkkk, gostei.
Playback speed 1.25 and It sounds fucking amazing as well .. ♥
me encanto
Think I'll go on a WALKABOUT
love so much!!
Cocaine is a wonderful drug. RHCP never dies!
Echoes of “What a Waste” by Ian Dury and the Blockheads.  But I don’t mind. An easy, fluid groove.  Looking forward to London June 26th.
Best band in the world!
Youhouhouuuuuuuuuuuuu !!!! so so great song !!
Red Hot Brasil ✳️🇧🇷
My dad loved these guys  I wish he was here to listen to new Chili Peppers Rest in peace ,dad.
Another excellent song from the greatest band in world
Só tem br aqui? Kkkk
Love it
There’s not enough funk in this world. The Chilis just brought it back.
Sempre atual absoluto
I'm getting one hot minute vibes haha
крутяк🔥
Que buena banda!!!
What an album this is going to be!
LEMBRA MUITO WALKABOUT (ONE HOT MINUTE - 1995) <3
Proper kushty song
Beautiful song
Belleza!!! ❤🖤
DIOS MIOOOOOOOOOOOO
John said Sir Psycho Sexy was the sexiest song he ever heard at the time of recording the documentary. This might give it a run for the $$!
Here ur English comment
So that’s where the funk went
👍🏼🤘🏽💥🤩
Very reserved and laid back solo work by John. Works perfectly with the funk vibes
AAAAAAAAH FANTÁSTICO😍😍😍😍
Boring. Black summer was a banger
Just wishing I could time travel to there concert... August can't come soon enough
Grooves so smooth like butter....😃😃❤❤
🙌
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA❤❤❤❤❤
This is like something right off of Stadium Arcadium
Não é uma música ruim, é bem digerível, mas também não é nada de especial, parece mais um b-side do I'm With You, n estou reclamando, mais sei lá neh, to achando o The Gateway melhor em comparação aos singles...
I love you RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!! Eu fui no show de 14/10/2002 às (21:00hs) em Porto Alegre,uma segunda-feira incrive!!!!Só quem foi sabe. A cada ano que passa sou absolutamente mais fã desta incrível banda!!!
Rick Rubbin influence!!! 🇧🇷🎸❤️
Their best funk song since Can’t Stop
Meh.  Been a fan from Freaky Styley to Stadium.  This new album is sounding pretty lackluster, the grooves are nice but predictable.  I haven't heard John really bring it back yet, I guess we'll see.  This looks like another double album from the song list.  I loved Stadium although it was a little bloated.  Josh is a really nice guy but not a fit like the first 3 guitarists.  I was just thinking about Hillel yesterday when listening to some Primus.
Paraguay los saluda 💪 tremendo tema
This sounds like a B-side from By The Way...
Oh yea, this album is gonna be epic.
I work at taco bell come over to my Taco bell 🤣 !!! Do live show? 😲 Wow or come get a free meal I'll pay RHCP!!!
Parabéns para os brasileiros, aqui presente, os cara lançam um som novo e 80% dos comentários são de brasileiros, ser a que o rock vai ressuscitar!!
Ain’t no way in hell AK is going to remember all those lyrics 😂
And we're BACK to old Chlis, heck YES. This is freaking fantastic, can't wait for this full album
🔥🔥🔥🔥
So funky and so good

Lindos
I would love to hear Anthony spit this live! So much funky goodness.
Que venha mais funk nesse novo álbum!
Los quiero mucho a estos muchachos , sobre todo cuando John usa un wah - wah y hace los coros al mismo tiempo !! Larga Vida a lo RedHot' . Vengan para Argentina hermanoooooo!!!!
The FUNk is back!!🤩🤩🥰
Cuándo sale el video oficial!?
Só Brasil nos comentários, que massa!
I kinda feel like my band (this channels'  namesake here) can and have written better choruses than this. Like, on a whole, averaged off, of course! In fact, I'm SURE of it.  With regard to Sincereity and earnestly singing poetry for a quite poetic feel... Yep the JSE will always be there to bust out just one more song to slay this Earth.  Or if it's a comical, feel good, care-free, lax or party track. We can bring on the ruckus and deliver there too.  That all being said, LOVE IS THE way, the start and end of this visualizer - wait up, did anyone notice? Like halfway through did the clip begin to just repeat in an inversion of itself  I know I'm using the wrong verbiage here but hopefully you'll know what be I MEAN  Anyhoo, ok I'm just saying we're (the Mighty JSE) quite flexible and versatile, oddly enough,much like the fluidity of many of our bandmates, sought out for the future and both in the past as well as here now in the present tense.  And boy is it tense here!  It's like I said I was a baby murdereeerererwerere Anyway what I am trying to say is that we take our role seriously, as verteran, self funded over educated nyc indie rockers... But we do have a ball if I can say so myself. So we'll play anniversary show after anniversary show. Both making fun of farewell tours like Cher and Kiss, but you know, in a dive bar like CBGBs and throwing on your bright yellow marvel superhero boots and a cape to play bass  In fact, many of our bassists and drummers who have come and gone throughout the eras of my band, to supplement and augment the sound or provide necessary accompanyment. It's actually rather ridiculous that we've never found, nor hired or employed a full-time 2nd guitarist 🎸 And it's not really for lack of trying either  Quite the contrary, we've Actually tried so many out  Having even played one off gigs with frankie fuzz, fizz, Rizzo, francisco, lamont, clement, Logan, JMG, oz, general lee, fred, master kwon, josh, ben (cohen, not simborski, think shoulda thought of that sooner as I'm sure he'd LOVE to... It's just that he's such an exceptional drummer.... Like my introduction into Ben's (S) world was seeing him on televison. Playing with some Calypso tinged jazzanova sultry seduction that seemed both extremely complex and effortless at once. I was impressed  I'd see him around the years, usually at beihhd dorhood bar b as and other friends shows, but it wouldn't be until I'd see him with Susan (aformented Jean Grey, Storm, Wolverine colored boots ...) That I felt confident enough to approach them, this, a fact, looking back- REALLY depicts, right there.just HOW radically I've changed this decade. And 'no' I don't mean by this all encompassing measure that is neither one way (all good) or another (way bad)  It's not all been positive or  all negative but it's certainly been a trip.  And as time matches on its become ever more apparent how easy integration of friendships, establishing enemies as such and instigating potential partners into matches. Successfully. This of course, for an INTj (former,,) Like me I had great difficult learning how to NOT fried zone those I was interested in, either friend zoning myself or inadvertently putting them in the friend zone with my overbearing over compensation of vulnerability and honesty displays.  Still, as a quite the sexual exhibitionist and voyeuristic thrill seeking director of videographer and instigator acting in films on stage... I conducting dozens and dozens of interviews on my podcast and radio show fish fantasy...  Even if we do poke a bit offun at the stuffy career
Aí é som pohaaaaaa....
Acertaram mais uma vez, seus filhos da mae
Só great
mano, ta perfeito
Ooooo my  ...... God. Just perfect
Good song! One Hot Minute (one of my fave RHCP records) vibes right there! \m/
I just love you guys. <3
Kind of a One Hot Minute groove Dig it..
i absolutely love rhcp but it’s a whole car payment or more to go to their concert 😭😭😭
This is phenomenal, like the proper old tunes. Masterpiece
He'll yeah RHCP!!!! ❤ 💋
Cara esse som tá maravilhoso, me lembra um pouco "Walkabout" do 'One Hot Minute' e "Funky Monks" do 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik".
😍
Brasi, como sempre, em peso 🇧🇷 RHCP, como sempre, foda 🤘🏻
I need the Frusciante turned up, please! Thanks!
Love the new music! ❤❤
back to funky roots.. i like the other song better.
Don’t let this distract u from the fact that Jesus is coming soon
NEM VO COMENTAR, RUIM KKKKK
Sou português e é incrivel ver como 80% dos comentários são BR. Essa nação ama mesmo RHCP
I’m sure I didn’t understand over 90% of the lyrics in this song. Still love it tho.  Didn’t even know they were releasing new music again.

só fazem hinos! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
MAIORIA BRASILEIRO ?
The world feels insane. But.. at least we still have the RHCP to bring the LOVE and chill the nerves.
another single
🔥 🔥 🔥 Rock on 🌶 🌶 🌶   1 of the only memories I have of my Father is sitting with him watching Under the Bridge on an old ass tube TV! Never stop guys RHCP for life!
The tones, the grooves, my GOD Flea and John work so well together - this takes me back to BSSM!!
Getting some “We Didn’t Start The Fire” vibes, but with more of a pop culture angle…very nice! Keep it coming, can’t wait for the rest of the album!❤️
Love love
OK, black summer didn't do it for me at all. This is more like it!
Why are all top comments in Spanish/Portuguese?
Is it me or isn't this just Ian Drury and the Blockheads?
It real, UNLIMITED LOVE
Anthony Kiedis deserves far far more respect than he sometimes get. He is a brilliant musician and there is no Chili Peppers without him
WooooooooooooooW. Foda, thats so fckin nice
No puedo dejar de escucharlo, me poseyó jaja. El buen funk al estilo rhcp
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Amo este toque JAZZ !!! <3 el cambio es perfecto pero la evolución es magistral
Me gusta 👍🏼
Love it!
Rhcp for life, love this new song as well as the rest of the new album so far, (even though there are only 2 songs so far😅) can’t wait till April first 💖💖💖
Love the peppers, but this sucks.
Think of this combo : RHC but Trey Anastasio joins this funk jam! John and Trey would be fantastically interesting and rocking! Glad these boys are back ❤
This is the song that will play one day on my personal beach on Hawai, while a lovely Hawaian girl with big breasts, will dose me with pinacolada served in coconut.
This song reminds me of Blood Sugar Sex Magik
This is the most one hot minute sound that I've heard from RHCP since Dave Navarro. This song reminds me so much of walkabout mixed with we turn red in such a cool way! I think I'll go on a walkabout and find out what being red as a lobster is all about. Heck yea curious about the rest of the songs I think these are a small sample and they're saving their best to blow our minds as usual.
Wey los amo, por ustedes le echo ganas a la vida. Vengan a México maldita seaaaaa ❤
✌✌✌
Massa, lembra muito o álbum freak style,.quem é veterano vai lembrar.
Simply amazing 👏🏻
💥💥😎😎
funky yummy delicious chilis
Love you, guys 🇧🇷💛💛💛
Walkabout
Sounds like the chili pepper I fell in love with back in 2001 Thank you.
Liked both the singles so far . It must be a difficult task to follow iconic hits of the past but that was then and this is now.  I love the chorus and outro on this. Super cool stuff
RHCP is the one band that lets the base be heard
Timeless!
Este rollo es vuestra marca, vuestra mejor versión, me gusta!!!
They’ve definitely got their funk back, also known as John Frusciante.
04 marzo 2022.
❤️❤️❤️💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
OS MELHORES!!
so excited for the rest of the album to drop
🤔🧐🤨
By the way, me and my friends think that we have the dark necessity of heard the whole album!! Frusciante is back!!
Honestly I dont like it(((
They have always been dope and keep continuing to be dope. Seeing them in concert in August here in my home state in Michigan! I'm so stoked!
Can anyone saaay "Walkabout"!???.
Brazil loves you <3
Omg evangelizing love it brothers
I wonder if Anthony was inspired by Billy Joel's, "We Didn't Start The Fire," for this. Do I hear some production firsts for RHCP? (Delay on vocals and some keyboard sounds.)
Can't wait to listen the whole new album! If it sounds like "Poster Child" and "Black Summer" it will be my another favuorite album by RHCP. ❤❤❤ BTW It's perfect song to drive a car somewhere far and  enjoy the trip... or soak up the sun on a hot day on the beach! 😍🥰
this is more like it ✌✌✌
meus velhinhos não decepcionam <3 muito a cara do one hot minute essa música
To the guy who puts these lyrics in the comments section ... Good luck bra'...
RHCP never left.... But still they come back strenger!!!!
No tenía idea de cuánto le gustaba la banda a nuestros hermanos brasileiros 🤣 Qué suave rola ☺️
It took me like two seconds to hit “like”
I miss the Style oh josh
Cool neon following Flea!!
🙄
It ain't a new thing coming from John here. But I love the bass lines.
John better use some of the the money he earns to make another solo album
Bella
1:23 "a small banana in your poop" 🍌💩
Has more of that b side raw feel to it
Notável influência do nosso samba ❤️🔥🇧🇷
Isso é lindo demais,que Groove Red Hot de volta ❤️❤️❤️
Black summer was good but it didn’t get me excited for the new album like this song does
04/03/2022
🤩Posso sentir a mesma sensação de quem viveu em 1991, magnífico.
nice
Sempre RHCHP. Brasil!

Sending love to everyone. I hope you have a great day. Happy to see RHCP coming out with a new song!
Love this way better than the other new one ☝️
If this is the supposed to be the second best song on this album I’m very scared of the the rest of the album.
Its like a funnier version of we didn't start the fire from billy Joel still good though
O rock vive ! 🤟🏼
unfortunately there is a terrible song😐
This is fucking amazing
Los hijos bobos de funkadelic. Nunca van a er como ellos
Better try learn the words then
RHCP "despues" de californication dejo de ser RHCP
The dumbest sons of funkadelic... never are be like thems.
İt would be a mistake to call it very good, THİS İS BEYOND PERFECT
Hated this when it dropped now I absolutely love it. This is going to get put in more than one movie. Now that you can look up the lyrics, do it. They’re amazing
Anyone transcribe the lyrics yet?🤣😂
Flow 🏄😎
I love Black Summer. This song, not so much
THİS İS SOOOOO GOOOD RHCP
GRACIAS POR EXISTIR !!!!!
a "walkabout" sense, but I prefer a "dosed" vibe instead... F*** covid, I was about to listen John Live in Athens
Waiting for the obligatory comment with the lyrics!
I love it, much better than the first one
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌♥️
El mejor Rock siempre estuvo aquí
Navarro?
gostei mais do que a black summer :)
Ya suban el maldito álbum!!!
That bass❤️
O BRASIL PIRA COM OS CHILI PEPPERS <3 Não tem como fazer música ruim.
Corey Henry... bravo! That's the colab of 2022 right there
Great song 10/10
Love this track 👍🏻 they are back !!!
❤❤🔥🔥
Seems to be a One hot minute funky song. Love it 😍
Resumindo: a banda terá um grande sucesso novamente, em breve!!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is a hit.
COME TO BRAZIL
Omg there back can’t wait for this album..
I'm a hard core RHCP fan since 1999, and I'll stick by them till the very end, but knowing their early funky albums, this song is a bit lazy and nothing new... however, still looking forward with excitement for the album
Bringing the funk. This is one of the best songs Ive ever heard.
no puedo imaginar un mundo sin ellos 💖
great style
con esta cancion me sieneto que estoy dentro de una pelicula pipipip

Tendré pesadillas con la patineta del video como por una semana
Makes me remember “Walkabout” from their 1995 album.
Waiting for Anthony to say california but it never happens
Funkylicious 🤘🏼😎
Vi que os BR tá com tudo!! A nova geração ainda tem salvação 🤟
INSANE SINGLE. I am rn a refugee from Ukraine and this new track is a real gem in this dark world
Fat Dance meets Walkabout. :D
oh hell yea!!!!
Lizzy looking mighty thin … never in a million years would I have expected there to be a reference to my other favorite band in the newest release of RHCP! Feels like a sign!!
eh come on guys you can do better than this i know you can
ME ENCANTA ❤️❤️❤️
Love the funk style, just like good old times, Vivan Lo Red Hot!
Lembrando de quando era criança e escutava esses caras todos os dias, simplesmente a banda que não tem músicas ruins #loverhcp
That boy Anthony spittin!!
how tha hell Anthony is suppose to sing that live??? like, or you breath and stay alive... or you sing this song. You can't do both. Lol
que coisa linda cheio de brasileiro aqui meu deus que musica maravilhosa,a guitarra do john frusciante como sempre nao falha nunca
Another great song. All the RHCP songs are worth it to listen.
Super! Su música sigue siendo única como Siempre
Saudade da vibe das antigas!😍 que delícia de música ❤️
Hay más brasileños que ingleses o hispanoparlantes.
Que bosta
This will crazy to perform live
Frusciante forever
Great intro and outro!!!
nice
new contender for hardest karaoke song
el sebas
Black Summer was so bland an uninspired it got me worried about this upcoming album. This song is a big step in the right direction.
Walkabout b side vibe
This sounds like Walkabout so much   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW4yvVhB1PE
groovera
Good. Something different to Ukrainin and russia war
O no, one hot minute vibe
the best bend!!!!!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I m one of the most RHCP you will ever find but this is shit..sorry😑
good music.
This song was waaaay better than Black Summer, can’t wait for the new album! I love me some funky RHCP
Make it Funky!
👏👏👏👏👏
Amo a los RHCP son lo mejor de lo mejor 🤜🤜🤜🤜🇬🇹🇬🇹🇬🇹🇬🇹 ojala pueda verlos de nuevo en vivo
🇧🇷❤️
Qué temón se mandaron. Los amo
Where can we find this magnificent neon red hot love deco ? i want it in my house :D or may be we need to ask them to have it on the store 😝🥰😍
Album is gonna kick so much ass
I like this alot actually
🔥
All r8 int it
Dude I was in class when this dropped. I was certain I was going to see it when right when it came out.
I've had this song on repeat for hours. It's so amazing how you guys still have your sound after all these years it's like I just got bitch slapped by the 90s and I love it
Hell Yeah!
if you make the speed to 2x, Anthony Kiedis turns into an animal crossing character
Aguante los Peppers carajo
Still hot 🤟
I like this song😎 they're the best🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Blood Sugar and Stadium had a baby?!?
This is simply sick. My favorite group of all time stayed loyal to it's FUNKY ASS roots. This is definition of style This is definition of COOL Sounds like a freakin' early 80s banger. Frusciante licks in the middle of the song are simply astonishing, so GOOD. Reminds me a bit of a Sir Psycho Sexy lickwise. Love to FLEA, TONY, JOHN AND CHAD❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️
Just, absolute greatness.
Feels like I took a time machine back to funkier days!!!❤️
Primero buenas tardes, segundo Brasil
The intro its like Hollywood, from freaky  stiley
There are so many different opinions here... But clearly two types of ppl: those who prefer the 89-98 era and love the song and those who prefer the 98-00's and are a little upset with this 😕  Honestly I'm more of a second type and prefer Black Summer to this one... But still have faith on their work and what's coming next
like si hablas espanol :)
Love you Guys always and forever💙🤗✌🏽🇲🇦🇳🇱
Comecei ouvindo no 1,25X, depois que me dei conta mudei pra 1X e preferi no 1,25X mesmo, ehehehe
Está voltando aos velhos tempos com músicas encantadoras
Круто
Йойо
Эйэй
Quanto br aqui kkk
They are already here, how much I need them
To be honest, this song is a disappointment for me after black summer
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
this song is exactly like walkabout (one hot minute) combined with mac de marco
This song makes me wanna restart pop culture
anthony's washed
I keep pushing repeat
They're f'n back...son...🥁
I need bigger lungs!
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
nnnnnice
Walk about vibes
Walkabout vibes!
En la media noche, un amigo y yo escuchamos y hablamos del nuevo single. Él me comentó que esta canción está completamente inspirada/basada en Chameleon de Herbie Hancock, fue algo que me comentó casi de manera automática mientras escuchábamos Porter Child por segunda vez. Es claro que ahí está la fuente. Por parte de los RHCP, esto es algo distinto a lo que traían y que no digerí en las primeras vueltas que le daba a la canción. Creo que es un nuevo paso para la banda que me gusta cada vez más. Pero aquí esta Herbie Hancock sin duda alguna.
wow
I love the song! Greetings from Bulgaria <3
I will be forever a fan of RHCP!  I've seen them 3x live. They always put on a great show and bring the energy, camaraderie, and fun all bands should have!  However, I'm not a fan of this song...LOL.  It just seems gimmiky to me.  I'm interested in hearing the sounds that John and Flea create!  They're magic together!!
Fireee 🔥
Peppers are eternal!! Long live RHCP!!

Se siente la vibra Frusciante 😍
🇨🇷🇨🇷❤️❤️❤️❤️
omg
Da pra ver pelos comentários que os Brasileiros amam o Red Hot Chili Peppers, eu sou um kkk
Muitas pessoas dizendo que soa como Blood Sugar, mas, para mim, a música me lembra muito algumas coisas do One Hot Minute, sobretudo Walkabout. Sem dúvida será um dos melhores lançamentos do ano!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
A bit of Walkabout vibes from one hot Minute imo
CARALEOOOOO VAI TOMA NO CUUUU QUE SOM FODAAAAAAAA
daleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eso es mis red hot, i love ........
I'm getting huge one hot minute vibes. Walkabout with a quick rapping rhyme
Guys, u are in old squad but you kinda miss old power
🧘🏻‍♀️🍃💓🌟🎧🎵Que linda la Noche🌌
Woooooooo!!!! That’s AWFULLY FUNKY
Okay gotta get this off my chest… I really appreciate RHCP, they are one of the Main reasons I Startes making music at a Very Young Age. I love Johns Solo stuff from around 2004, not to mention how great he is as a Lead guitarist. Chad inspired me as drummer Hella times and flea doesn‘t Need no introduction. As time Went by, I slowly Started listening to Other music all Across the board (recently Black midi for example), however the chillis really Held a dear Place in my heart for what they are: my favourite Arena Rock Band, a Huge Part of my childhood! I thought to myself "hey… eventough, You’re Not Crazy about Some of their stuff anymore, they still Rock, Which is Never gonna Change“ and when Black summer dropped, I found it to be a Bit borring, but Not Bad at all…. But this fucking Song, OMG, Not to Hate on my old idols  buttt it is literally poor man‘s walkabout ( Track from one hot Minute ) it is worse Than 80% of the catalogue And to be fair, eventough I love John, Josh would have been blamed for such an uninspired Piece :/  Treating Josh (who brought a New Drive to the band)  like trash, just for this Richard Hell, Taco Bell line is a sin!!!!!!!!!
One hot a minute 😅
It feels like they have somehow accumulated all that Josh-decade into one song, with a lot of John's influence.
COOL 'N SMOOTH
Melhor banda representando segunda musica do álbum e n decepcionou
It’s ok. A little too long and gets boring.
ME DEJAI DE LA CTM 💜
Que doideira ouvir de primeiríssima mão assim, acabado de lançar. E junto com irmãos de todo mundo. Salve RHCP
I'm looking for the comment with the lyrics... Where are you?!! 🧐
Go go go RHCP! You guys sound fantastic!
SÓ BR AQUI CARAIIII RHCP FODA DEMAIS

Os Fãs mais novos da Banda podem até reclamar e estranhar, mas essa é a essência da banda, o Funk, podia muito bem ser uma música do Blood Sugar Sex Magic, ou One Hot Minute com o Navarro, mas essa é a graça fazer  som de qualidade daquele tempo nos dias atuais, isso é a Pura Alma do RHCP 🌶️🔥
Reminds me of Ian Dury & the Blockheads. I like it though.
Hola, hablando por edits feos de red hot y antonio y los picantes del norte, me parece un temazo, muchas gracias.
yall dont actually like this
Damn such layed back funk with bite, it sounds like one of their first albums love it
Sending Funky Kiss from Croatia ❤😘💃
Funky like Codrington Park.
Funk funk funk! Peppers have ever loved funk!!! We love funk
It's about MFing time.
Not bad. Not great.
Cómo los quiero
In a matter of weeks I have grown so obsessed with Anthony! There is a level of appreciation that comes with age which I did not have 30 years ago... You are nit lacking in ANY department after 30 years!♡♡♡♡
Gracias por el Groove de siempre
🇧🇷
Entre este temón y la music sessions del biza con residente tengo la semana cubierta!
Fuck yeah!!!
thats nice and chill song
Robbie Williams style , nice one
eu amo e nao é pouco!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi
Funk till the end  , rhcp
Hah. This album is going to be so great!
Dá hora. Banda fodástica!!
💕💕💕
Great song with the bloodsugar vibe + jupiter feelings! My favorite band of my life is back together BUT now I have to sell tickets for my first concert ever because of the special operation!!! 😥😥😥 I wont give up though, and as soon as it possible I get to a New concert, keep in rocking Rhcp, you are the Best I can imagine since I've heard you in 2000!!!
set the playback speed to 1.25 .... thank me later
YES!!!! We've got Anthony's rappy groove AND melodic voice, Flea's amazing funky bass riffs, Chad's consistent and perfect tempo driving the song....and MOTHERFUCKING FRUSCIANTE'S back and better than ever! I'm now complete! #RHCP is back, baby! 🌶🌶🌶❤❤❤❤
Hell yea
Amasin'
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Grooving hard while trying harder to figure out the lyrics to this red hot song!
In love with this song. Feels like they went back to their roots but also acknowledged they're old men now.
Josh come back! bring creativity back, this is not great at all
RED HOT RAIZ É OUTRO NÍVEL, NÉ GALERA ? Muito foda! LOVE U GUYS :)
That outro... sounds very reminiscent to John's song Dark/Light (the second part) off his album The Empyrean. Love it!!
This one is a no for me thanks.
ONE OF FLEA’S GREATEST BASS LINES OF ALL TIME👏🏽🙌🏽🔥
Классно 👍
Slinky as fuck. Ace guys!
*Anthony singing live trying to remember the lyrics*  🤡🤡🤡🤡
🎉
👑👑👑👑
this was actually incredible
Lot of people saying it sounds like walkabout i cant see it. Really feel like this song compared to black summer is a massive let down  Anyone else feel the same?
ah red hot chili peppers, they never fail to deliver. this album is gonna be great 🤟
Quem acha que o antony vai errar essa letra curte ai kkkk
This is SO Red hot chili peppers 🤩
Invencíveis!
I love the visual stuff for this record. Might just have to get an unlimited love tattoo
This weirdly reminds me of One Hot Minute era!
An istant classic
Walkabout part 2
I prefer songs like Sick Love masterpieces vs this rambling.
Se loco.... que som ótimo
Ta linda la noche
Noice
Use me as a second LIKE button...
It’s not a bad song but people have a short memory. This is the song Walkabout from the album One Hot Minute, also a good song. Just saying, almost identical.
This won't be the best song on the album by any means, but its a cool groove with some nice lyricism by Anthony and some nice funky bass by Flea. I liked it better the second time I listened to it.
Old school funk, reminiscent of Parliament Funkadelic Era. This is Peppers returning to their roots and surpassing all expectations. I'm super chuffed for new music and I'm loving what I've heard thus far. GO Chilis!
so rocksy 💖🤘✌🖤💖
Parece que sói tem BR aqui kkk
Love this, it reminds me a lot of "Life Is A Rock."
Nos vemos en Junio!🥳🥳🥳
GTA 6 with this song
Los mejoreeeeees!!!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Love 🤩💘
Опять душу рвёте на куски..
Ak nailed this one 🦢
Guitar solo please
Freaking cool song 🔥 RHCP i love all of us ❤️ They Rocks😎
lourd
I was having a bad day until I saw this....
Gracias x volver  ♥️🇦🇷
my religion, the rhcp
Só tem BR comentando kkkkkkk
Return to RHCP roots!!! Great
We need art in Russia now! Thank you
They got it, they still got it!! Love them!! 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Los amo Mal
Sounds like Dave Navarro on guitar!
This song just puts a big smile on my face!
3:20 what great vocal melody
Muito bom mesmo ! Só sonzeira !!! Very Very good 👏👏👏
Funky 👍
Que bom que não subiram o videoclip aqui no youtube, video horrivel
Good…NOT great by far!
Yes!! 😘
Son mi banda favorita, ambos temas nuevos me gustaron. Pero siendo críticos y sinceros, ojala con ojos de un no fan (cosa que me cuesta mucho), siento que no hay nada nuevo ni en este ni en black summer.
J'adore...C'est excellent l'instrumental et la chanson est géniale
Caraca. Vem logo abril
Decepção número 2 desse álbum
YES!
Sounds like it could be on GTA 5!!!
It sounds like its missing a guitar part ontop or something but otherwise its aight
Te amooo frusciante !!! Siempre pulpo !!!
Es como un tema arrancado del One Hot Minute, pero con John 🔥🔥🔥
amazing!!
Reminds me of “walkabout” from One Hot Minute
Só tem br aqui o.o
Well, now I’m even more pumped for Unlimited Love
Help Ukraine!
Que música para sumir com o carro na estrada 😎😎😎🤘🤘🤘🤘
I think I'll go on a walkabo-- uh, wait
🇧🇷
Frusciante Peppers are back! Have you tried one? Hottest tastiest peppers on the planet!
Consigo imaginar este som em algum filme 😍💥
Fantastici
Luv John's backing mellow vocals.
its all ok, but i still do not understand why Anthony uses autotune in both this and black summer
R.H.C.P. FOREVER 🤟🇧🇷
Very good, but honestly black summer was better
Hehe legal 😎
❤️
Ladies and gentlemen today revived the music
minuto 5:00, hermoso!
RHCP😍 the best
Relaxing and great I love Red Hot Chilli Peppers music
Muito bom.
blood sugar vibes, nice!
A huge rhcp fan here. This is not one of their good ones. You got my best of my loco, yoko wtf is this lyrics. Come on rhcp you can do better
Reminds me of BSSM and One Hot Minute. Fuck yes.
They never lose their old funky vibe! •CHILIES FOREVA•
Why are most of the comments in spanish?
Once amazing, always amazing
This is like a mix of "Sir Psycho Sexy" and "We Didnt Start the Fire".
blood sugar, mother's milk... é apenas RHCP. é uma vibe deliciosa. dá pra tirar um pouco de tudo que eles lançaram até hoje. Que som massa!
This sounds like 70's porn music! LOL
Wow!!!!
Nothing special, not even close of being a hit.
Tonho nunca vai gravar essa letra! rsrs
flea still the best bassit in history
❤❤❤❤❤❤
QUE REFRÃO, QUE MÚSICA, QUE BANDA <3
Que bom essa formação rhcp
I love your músic...♥️♥️♥️
New Album! Yeeyyy
Red Hot Chili Peppers 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
So, John finally did listen to One Hit Minute?
vibe mother's milk... amando demais!
O Antony não vai esquecer essa letra ao vivo não, pode confiar 👍
featuring Cory Henry  WOW!
It's like Walkabout but more fresh
Je kiffe, TOP, - LE Style Californien.....   ( De la part d'un fan BELGIUM !!!)🤡☮️😳💓
What?
Fucking different and FUCKING GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eminem thought he was the fastest vocalist nah this guy
Wonderful song 😊 We are waiting for your concert in Ukraine when the war is over.  You are probably out of politics, but I will be grateful if you support Ukraine in this difficult time.  #closethesky #stopwar #stopputin
is it just me or do I hear Walkabout from One hot minute in this song
sounds like old skool chillis!
Funky monks... daaang this is a vibe
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶🌶
essa música tem uma pegada boa de Purple Stain que me deixa viradão no clima
You got the best of my yoko
Increíble 🔥❤️
This might be one of my favorite songs
Bom demaisssssss!
Thank you for this great song...
This song is a vibe
I close my eyes and imagine Stewie Griffin
Flea mode is ON
thumbs up, peppers.
Can’t wait for this album!
ese bajo paa
Reminds a little of the style of "Walkabout" on a walkabouttttttt... LOVINNNNNG THIS bam bam bam bam
Roloooon los amooo <33333
Essa música tá impecável!!! Muita vibe blood sugar e upflit mofo party plan… AMO VOCÊS C TODO MEU CORAÇÃO ❤️🔥
The RHCP Style is in your ADN. It’s simply unique!
Oh wow :')
When you guys come to Portugal?
❤️❤️❤️ Venham logo pro Br 🐢
Ojala vengan a mi país
All The B-sides of The Chili’s are good and we always thought why they didn’t released song A or B as a single. Poster Child is a B-side song that was released as a single. The more we listen to it The more it gets special.
Cosmic funkadelic vibrations swirling around from the infinite energy of the divine universe of rockinfreakapotamus. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are back.
Eh. Idk. Kinda same ol RHCP and def not something Anthony or John can pull off life. 3 guitar parts, non stop lyrics that were punched in every other line.
Que musicaaa boaa meu deus do ceu
Wow, that's rock! This funky inflections brings me back to Give It Away, but classier... hands up! Can't wait to listen all of the new album! ✌💜
Привет из России... Rhcp great!!!
RHCP are still the top
Mother's milk and blood sugar red Magic vibes are in thia song. It's amazing how John change the atmosphere of these group. Long life to the RHCP S2
Cool....getting Ian Dury "What a waste"  vibes off the verses over a  OHM "Walkabout" wah groove.
Keidis rarely disappoints and this is no exception. Saw an article that said he pulled a “We Didn’t Start the Fire” move and damn, did he ever. Freaking awesome. Just the references to the past took me on a journey, then add that to the return of Frusciante’s funk…damn. Flea and Chad kick ass as always. Yes yes yes
This is the real vaccine
Kan irá gostar!
Single cali: around the Word, otherside. Single btw: cant stop, by the way. Single stad arcadium: Dani, desecration smile.  Single Unlimited love: black Summer and poster child. WTFFFFFFF.😱😱
Masters of nostalgia
There's a familiarity about this but it's got the funk for sure. Love it.
🌶️ John's rhythm is back 🌶️
Black Summer lembra Californication Poster Child lembra Dani California  que fase maravilhosa imagina como deve estar o album
one hot minute vibes. love it
The old magic is still there......! Long may it continue.
OJOO
🔥✳️🔥✳️🔥✳️
What a difference a guitarist makes 🥰
I can see John dancing to this like he was playing 'Scar Tissue' at Slane.
Walkabout meets Mercy Mercy, i love it
Awesome track, not quite as epic as black summer but still I'm sure this album will be kickass!!!!
A B-side of an outtake
Really reminds me of one hot minute but with a John twist
Sono tornati
😍😍😍
If someone says "I don't like RHCP" I immediately dislike them.
funky.
Love u guys... thanks for ur music. Greetings from Argentina
La mejor banda del mundo ❤️
Desde Argentina muchos saludos a los fans de red hot chili peppers
Yeah!!
Another awesome song from RHCP in 2022:) <3
Chidaaa
Ehaaaa
Rhaaa
OHMYGOODNESS THIS IS SOOOOO GOOOD
Muito bom
Fantastic ❤️
Amo aquí 🥰 ojalá vengan a México pronto 😭❤️
The funky vibe in RHCP will be always there. I like a lot this kind of songs cause I always start to dance like Kiedis haha... just enjoying :)
booooom
wait so John left again and Navarro came back again or what
This sound like Walkabout and this definitely OHM style
I love it, such chill <3
Lyrical Magica❤️‍🔥. A poet and rapper too, perioD.
Nice!! A slower, groovy, excellent song!!!!!! Love it!
🌶 Thank the good Lord for RHCP🌶  Perfect timing in these not so great times. WE LOVE YOU!
Really loved your new song. amazing.
Two words: yes
So sexy song... ❤️
I think I’ll go on a walkabout.
лучшие!!!
sounds californication era! love it
Simplemente red Hot chili peppers 👩‍🎤❤️
Really enjoying this one, and enjoying the contrast in sound to 'Black Summer'.
RHCP nunca decepciona. 🇧🇷❤
This song would have been a b-side on every other album of theirs. Not a big fan.
Funk mental..... Love it.
que música foda, pqp o ritmo e a guitarra ficaram incríveis
I would have liked a guitar solo...
DUDE DUDE DUDE
I would rather listen to The Peppers than ANY OTHER BAND OF ALL TIME!!   These fellas still making GREAT MUSIC and been doing it so long together!   Hope they drop another album next year
Legends
Funk al puro estilo de los Red hot 🤘🏼
Como día Viernes, no podía esperar menos de ustedes mis amores bellos! Gracias RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!  mucho amor y mucho funky para tod@s! saludos desde CHILE mi bello CHILE!

Está vibe groove sempre original fazendo referência a grupos funk anos 70
Gracias 😭😭😭💖💖💖💖 me hacen feliz
Even if John only came back for backup vocals I would have been satisfied. This is awesome
So pumped for this album!! I LOVE THIS SONG!! THANK YOU RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ❤
RHCP are back :')
One hot minute meets the getaway 🔥
LOVE IT
Walkabout 2.0 😂, great song !
Die hard Chili Peppers fan 29 Shirts and counting. Seen live 3 times. And I really hate to say it but this is one of there less attractive songs. Really hope the rest of the album is better.
LEONARDO DANIEL AZEÑAS BRAVO TE AMOOOOOO!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
Vengan a Argentina grosos 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Love it, funky and quite different to Black Summer, also grows on me the more I hear it, like Black Summer did, can't wait for this album!
Ainda não escutei o album novo! Como Frusciante fazia falta!!
Boring song :(
This song sounds like Walkabout, One Hot Minute album!
UNLIMITED LOVE FOR RHCP♥️🔥
zaczyna mi się coraz bardziej ten nowy materiał PODOBAĆ, stare dobre RHCP :))
Walkabout vibes , love it
I'm a diehard fan of RHCP and Frusciante since forever, for the expectations that we had, I'm afraid  to say the song is a bit 'monotone', if not for the little instrumental embellishments at the end of the song, I would be more disappointed  Please don't keep it simple, we want some kick ass bass lines, more hendrix frusciante ish flavor please, we've been waiting for so long and we deserve some for that matter
Been waiting for this
What a vibe 🔥🔥
Corey Henry? Yesssssssss
IAM so so excited I am going to see y'all in September 😊
Gracias por volver John
John is on fire in this song.
First
Absolutely demolished
Chili peppers never disappoints <3
Lyrics anyone?
el ritmo me hace acordar a feasting on the flowers
Many greetings to south america, you seem to hang around here 👋
Reminds me kinda of the Dave Navarro era with its funky wahs
❤️❤️❤️ Genial 😊
🎧 got this on repeat
Why so many portuguese/brazilians?
Unlimited Love .. I'M WAITING FOR YOU!!
this doesn't feel like 5 minutes at all, time went flying with this
Unlimited Funky vibes !  Great!
que pegada é essa vei???? esse baixo ta muito top!! ❤❤
I've expecting way way better with John return...
Useless than by the way, wow, such a boring and crappy song.
🙌
( wearing my bass face)
Walkabout eres tú?...
me sinto satisfeito com essas musicas novas sendo lançadas <3
Quero ver o Anthony cantando essa ao vivo kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk vai inventar um novo idioma Brincadeiras a parte, essa música tem muito a vibe de Walkabout do One Hot Minute, interessante
Yes 😊
Como um bom Guitarrista faz toda a diferença! Red hot voltou com tudo!
Que genial está la música 🧐🍷
оце б дожити до квітня, закинутись кислотою і покататись на веселці під звуки свіжих гарячих перців. всім добра і миру! цьом
Essa banda nunca me decepcionar 👍👍
TOP
A beautiful funky swagger brother of One Hot Minute's "Walkabout", don't you think? Made my day!
Fighissima!! Aka… fucking cool!!
Hino, Anthony jogando palavras lindamente, Chad mantendo o ritmo de maneira impecável, John com sua guitarra e backing vocals inconfundíveis e Flea groovando e dando o swing para a musica. Musica muito vibe, linda e alegre.
Does anyone else hear God from The Empyrean in the outro?
Very few vocal contributions from John on these first two releases. S.A.'s b-sides had his vocals at full volume. Just saying
Just make sure John doesnt hear “walkabout” of off OHM ^^
Pessoal falando que isso é claramente o frusciante e tudo mais. Vocês tem que ouvir o one hot minute pq essa música é literalmente qualquer uma do one hot minute
Went to the comments to see if anyone could post the lyrics then heard the intro... there's no way hahaha
Taco bell!
que maaammmmboooo
There is no chance that AK will not forget lyrics of this song live 👀😂 ps. Love AK vocals here, epik!
Getting 311 vibes from this!
<3
Vendo os comentários dos vídeos do red hot da pra ver que no mínimo 50% dos fãs são de São Paulo
BEAUTIFULLY DONE
Wooww
Chili Peppers back in town Returning with a funky sound  All the fans are going wild Can’t contain a grin and smile
me encanta ,suena mucho al álbum "californication"
Funky as hell🔥🌶 blood sugar baby vamos🤘
Feels like tertle the turtle, we turn red and walkabout had a treesome and this was born.
Um amor chamado RHCP 🌶🔥. Os caras não cansam de ser bom . Me lembra muito sir psycho sexy em algumas passagens
🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song is gonna be something else when high
Música maravillosa! Gracias!
Good song ;) good new music!
Muzyka, która poprawia humor :)! 😍
Anthony showing off his rap skills, California style 💙💛💜❤️
This is for people who know RHCP well:  The very beginning of this song here reminds me of the song Hollywood (Africa) by RHCP from 1985.  Anyone agrees?
!!
Sounds like old times
Goooooood
Always good to know Anthony still can put out amazing tracks.
Just an English comment passing by...
NICE
<3
Seeing the chili peppers in august… there ain’t no way in hell Anthony is gonna remember the words to this
Bit thundercat in this?
Neen fan since BSSM. Going see them 1st time in Boston! Time to cross off the bucket list...no time to waste
This is the sound of middle 90' of RHCP, if John Frusciante was in the band! 😁
Early Peppers Vibe 💯 🎉
Awesome RHCP ✔️
Sounds like one hot minute. Walkabout
Making history.
2:27 :))
RHCP givin' what we ALL need most,  L ❤ V  E
🇧🇷🌶️
sem ouvir já sei que é boaaaa🤘♥️R.H.C.P
You just know he’s going to get the lyrics wrong when singing it live lol. Really like it though
essa entrada do Flea com baixo ficou top
Não curti a letra, o som até que é bacana. Fui ver a legenda e praticamente só tem referencia, desde guerra civil até maluco de hip hop, paias demais.
Hooly shit they did the music thing where they, like, play instruments. They need to do this more!
Mejor que black summer aún
Sitting on my couch eating blueberries and bobbing my head with a stupid smile on my face while this song just washes all my troubles away
WTF ?
Hell yes! 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Como pessoas podem odiar essa música cara, NÃO SÃO FÃS DE RED HOT
Good 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
I love ♥️🌈
YEAHHHHH
Vintage Pep
It’s Walkabout, Part 2!

Hello from Ukraine!!!! Thank you for your work!!!!! WOW
Love the song .. laid back with hints of Vintage RHCP
The best red hot chilipeppers period was the 80 s now sounds terrible, so comercial, no bass,  no drums, no nothing
This song remember me the sound they did in the beginning, it could be a song of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, that groove feeling 🙌👏
Nossa!!! John Frusciante voltou de verdade!
sounds like their 80's stuff!
Massa.
This was the “smartest” thing Anthony ever thought of lyrically.   Pretty soon the band should have a contest for which fan can replicate his Mach 11 syncopations to the mo
I'm not a huge fan of this one, but I guess it will grow on me, same as "Even you, Brutus". We'll see. Nevermind, still excited that they release new stuff. ❤️
Por algum motivo me lembrou as músicas do Gorillaz
Walkabout part 2
OHM puro <3 <3 <3
Is it me, or this song sounds like it could be on One Hot Minute?
A filling song like a single? okay...
Wooow Bravooooo!!!
The  song is nothing special but I like it, probably because it reminds me a lot of their 90's period. It could fit very well in One Hot Minute! I hope their new album goes in that direction!
It’s like hip hop over funk. Mad different.
These new tracks just keep getting better
There is no to ⏯️ 2Hide...
💜🔥💜
I’m from L.A.  Best. Band. Ever!!
For everyone love Hump de Bump that is a miracle😍😍❤
Beatiful groove funk.!! ❤️❤️👏👏
😄
Tres meses!! 🤘🤘
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Brasil!
Walkabout ❤✌️
The mother fucking boys are back at their absolute best since John first left. This is top tier shit here. So god damn groovy. If this is a SINGLE?? I'm so ecstatic right now. Here it comes.
Not enough guitar in the mix, but what a great tune....
This sounds just like the bsides from the californication era!
Curti bastante, mas to com medo de ser um album sem nenhuma musica que venha a ser um grande sucesso marcante.
Ive never been this early to a new rhcp song
musica bem singela
Yeah good song,enjoyed it, Can't help but think they have taken inspiration from the great Ian Dury & the blockheads. (Englands greatest poet)
Red Hot Chili Peppers still bringing the Smooth Groove to these tracks, as always. Feels like I'm literally waiting for a 70s movie to start.
play this at my funeral please
Pegada bem anos 80 da banda ❤❤

🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
Nada como um som do RHCP ❤
this is red hot chili peppers i know
Reminds me of We didn't start the Fire by Billy Joel
❤❤❤
Буду под Фанк пережидать бомбёжку.мир всем. Война это страшно. RHCP я с вами с 1996 года. Мой музыкальный вкус сформирован вами.
люблю вас!
Slava Ukraini!
i like this one
Holy shit! Incredible! ❤️
Seria essa música o mais novo clássic o do RHCP? #BRASIL
... lmaooooo 4 seconds in and I already love it
Gadinski probably loved this one when he heard the tracks.  Simply amazing, awesome outro, bssm vibes...impossible not to like! This needs to be on the live setlist
Anthony will never remember all the lyrics in a live concert
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Rapaz, eu já tô vendo Tonhão errando a letra dessa música umas vezes kkkkkkkkk
Ahhhhh GOD!!!! THIS IS SO FUCKING GOOD!!!! AHHHHH GOING CRAZY !!! PEPPERS FOR ETERNITY!!!!! 🌶
LOVE※
"Unlimited Love" album will be a hit for sure!
I have an absolutely shit day, including my family, all. Until i noticed this song was uploaded, thnx RHCP ❤️❤️❤️
Really good...some of the lyrics remind me of Billy Joel's " We didn't start the fire"
REMCO approved.
Esse cd vai ser bom hein
Me lembra muito as faixas do álbum Blood Sugar Sex Magic. Toooop.
True to your sound! Glad the boys are finally back together and finding their groove
👏👏👏👏
Well, honestly that was pretty bad.  The single Black Summer gave me hope cause it sounded and felt a lot like a Californication/By the way/Stadium Arcadium song and was like a rebirth, or some fresh air after those crappy "'i'm with you" and "the Gateway"... but frankly THAT song could have been in any of those two miserable albums.
This song is a Frusciante version of Walkabout from One Hot Minute.
They're back!
Flameee in the funk rock 🔥
Yes! reminds me of "Walkabout", mixed with a new sound. I love it!!!!
Walkabout Version 2
Got a sir psycho sexy vibe. Disappointed tho
There's no way that Anthony remember this lyrics on live 😂 love this funky sound is amazing 🤘
This band never die still make awesome art❤️
Как баллада пойдет, но чуть слабовато. Да текст хороший, но настроение не понятное, ждал только соло, думал что Джон вывезет. П.с - это мнение после двух прослушиваний, может я поменяю мнение вскоре.
This song is very awesome!!!! ❤️

Feels like this song was in the "Blood sugar sex magic" and I love it!
This is so deliciously funky!
... there's no way Anthony is going to be able to sing this live without flubbing half of the lyrics lol  But I'm still looking forward to seeing them live :)
Every single line of this song is simply amazing! 🇧🇷❤🤟🏻
Walkabout part2
🇧🇷🇧🇷🤙🏾🤙🏾🔥
This is Red Hot Chili Peppers!
FUNK PURO!
I WILL BE YOUR POSTER CHILD TONIGHT, LA-DA-DA-DA BUM-BUM-BUDUM 🔥 Cadê os br? 🧡🧡
In a Parallel Universe (he he--get it) John was on One Hot Minute, and this was one of the tracks.
They’re just as good as always been
Fraquíssima música , saudades de Blood sugar……
This new album is gonna be so good
This is so a b s o l u t l e y f u c k i n g r e a t - I kind of gave up on RHCP during Josh era, they were going in directions I couldn't relate music-wise but then Frusciante returned, Rick Rubin's at the desk again and they release a tune that could easily fit on Freaky Styley yet sounds fresh enough in 2022 ... that puts a damn smile on my face and I'm r e a l l y stoked for the record to come out (which I haven't been since 15 yrs probably)
Los putos amos han vuelto!!!
Kisses kisses from Brazil 💋🤟🖤🤟
¡Siguen siendo chingones! ¡Viva RHCP!
old rhcp vibes
These first two songs that have come out off of this new album have been mediocre at best. I am pretty disappointed. I was so stoked to see John come back and so far it's been a let down
I WILL BE YOUR POSTER CHILD TONIGHT, LA-DA-DA-DA BUM-BUM-BUDUM  Cadê os br? 🧡🧡
All I can say I am so glad you guys are making music like this in 2022. So funky yet that 90s vibe is there. As an RHCP fan for ages, i am just nostalgic. Thank you guys.
The Chili Peppers are my favorite band of all time but this song is TERRIBLE. Sounds like a B side or Demo. Hope the rest of the album is better.   EDIT: I honestly cannot get over how awful it really is...
Any one else getting One Hot Minute vibes? Just listened to the full album yesterday and this seems like a Walkabout sister almost. diggin' it though.
Já sabemos que essa não vão tocar ao vivo kkkkk
😀😀😀❤❤❤👍👍👍
Текст неплохой, но в целом такое себе. Вроде текст балладный, но зачитано как какой-то хип-хоп от 10ти летнего школьника под репит одной мелодии. Слабенько
Se nota la influencia del One Hot Minute en esta canción,  sería bueno que en vivo Dave Navarro también acompañe las giras con su estilo Funk Metal
DNA !
🤘🏾😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I really Love RHCP 💘🔥🙌🏾 my favorite band
Now this is a funky jam I can get behind
This song is boring. I see you guys have unlimited love not just for fans but for money. Hands down, awful.
♥️♥️♥️🇧🇷
Nalh leh pek hle
Soy el unico "raro" al que no le gustò esta cancion? O sea si, tiene funk y todo eso, pero no sè, me parece algun recalentado del anterior disco The Getaway, como si la banda se hubiera quedado anclada en esa epoca. Black Summer fue excelente, esta cancion meh
Funk is back in RHCP bitch! 🤘😁 Flea is amazing in this song 🕺
awww yea new peppers ❤🤘🔥
Por finn
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sounds like Ian Dury & the Blockheads "What a Waste."  https://youtu.be/ZmopROxBnBU
🔥
Incrível😻🇧🇷
Amazing song. I love the funk, beats , the lyrics, bass, drums and guittar. The melody is awesome. This is the Red Hot Chili Peppers I love! ♥️
Sick
A outra é melhor kkk
Vida longa ao RHCP, a banda da minha vida, e da vida de tantos aqui <3
They should have put another chorus here at 02:47 followed by the outro. This song is just too long.
Curti não
los quiero mucho :)
Literally obsessed, it's just fucking amazing! 1:33 ❤❤❤ and that outro 🔥
I used to be a fan, But now I am a whole air conditioner
John backingvocals...
Not impressed.
i was here on upload day :D
This is a very spring, tender and slightly melancholic song with its own special mood.  It's impossible not to fall in love with her. The guitar sounds super delicious.
Mi banda favorita sigue tan vigente...:)
Excelente canción!!
A+ fellas. Super Cali Fradja Listic Expi Ali Docious-istic
Omg!!!! Amo todo lo de ustedes!!!! ❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The 'Red Hot Chiliieeeesss'.
Relax
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHHHA
Amaaaaaazing funk groove! My lovely band 🌶️🔥❤️
Would be a cool fifa song
Nice
Groovy af!!!!!
If Anthony pulls this off live without forgetting a single word it will be a miracle of the century
Muito Bom!!!
Lembra mto one hot minute
❤️✨✨
❤️👄❤️
Would’ve been cool to have a nice solo
I love this song, really!!!
Возвращение к истокам
funk song in 2022 wtf
that's better
Sounds like I went back 30 years 🎧❤️
Frst
Los amo. ❤❤❤❤❤
It's amazing how they never lose it, here's another good song by red hot chili peppers   Love you RHCP♥️🤘 And come to Israel!🇮🇱
Love how the guitar flows with the lyrics. I also heard shades of Californication and One Hot Minute. Funky, I'm going to pull out some RHCP cassettes from back in the day. 🥵🌶️🌶️💚✌️🤙
Incrível como não tem uma música ruim ❤️🖤
Man 2 songs so close to each other.. Amazing
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
yesssss! i like the funky groove !
This song is so beautiful! 💖
Fooooooooooddddaaaa! 👊🔥
Anuncien la gira en sudamerica
That song is boring and tasteless. Hopefully the album has other better tracks
nunca falharam.
opaaa
Solo kinda reminds me of George Harrison!
This gives me Walkabout vibes. Amazing
Aqui só tem BR, aí sim 🔥❤️
funkyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
It's 1991 again.... so glad John is back!
walkabout vibes 😮‍💨 😮‍💨 😮‍💨🔥🔥
Ахуенно пиздато и даже заебись
Essa música tá boaa demaaaisss, olha esse groove minha gente, que coisa lindaaaaa...🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
This is like vintage Chili Peppers. Can't wait to see if Keidis can remember all these lyrics live, 🤣
VIVA! ❤
Ill come see you in Australia,
Parece vinho, passa o tempo e só melhora
Salve !!
So excited for this album! I’m especially pumped because JOHN IS BACK! Please stay for good this time, man. We missed you during your absences. RHCP just isn’t the same without you. Long live RHCP! ❤️
Simplemente hermoso
Melhor banda! RHCP! ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Big Blood Sugar Sex Magik vibes
this album does not look very good, unfortunately...
Lembra mesmo a época do Blood Sugar ou até os discos anteriores a ele. Resumindo: muito bom.
Chamomile
Incredible ♥️
Love it 👍 Longest running, consistently amazing band of ALL TIME
One hot minute.....
Its fucking great again. Cant do something bad?
Eu amo desde 1998 quando, desde meu primeiro álbum blood Sugar sex Magic 🔥🔥🔥
Thanks Red hot for coming back 😭💓🎵🎶
Esse álbum será foda!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Uff! The vibe just flew through within!
meh
Now that I think of it, Walkabout was a good jam...
soy súper fan de los peppers...este tema esta muy bien, pero creo que black summer me gusta más, me hace acordar a los b-sides de californication o by the way
The voice sounds like the self titled album Anthony, riff is like OHM or a side B from Californication and the outro is very original, actually the best of the piece, I want more of this.
🕺🕺♥️♥️ vamos los red hot la puta madreeeee
Funky as hell
Wish flee was there to slap the bass
loving this 💗 meeting with you, 8 years ago.. memories blur but won't go..
Meh
simplemente bello
Dreadful!
Son los mejores la ptmre 😭
Nice music 👍
Melhor banda do mundo! Como eu amo ser fã ❤️
I LOVE IT The vibes are soooo...OMG I missed you, guys <3 Thank you, God Bless You All <3
อย่างดี
que pro
Oh my god..that is so bloody sugar ..
The sort of song that would fit well on Mother's Milk - brilliant! So fking glad that Frusciante is back in the band.
La van a romper con el álbum completo 💚💚💚🔥🔥🔥
que musica foda. me faz soar a vibe do one hot minute, mesmo nao sendo o john na guitarra
now THIS is a vibe
Bless you peppers, get us some new funk every couple of weeks 🎶
This is great!
Great Song! o/
100% UNLIMITED LOVE
I love yall I'm seeing yall in concert sep 18th in Arlington
ah ya gimme dat funk
O FUNK voltou.

Só eu escutei "Monteiro Lobato" na música?
AMO VOCÊS DEMAIS
I didn't expect that kind of track but it sounds amazing. It's pretty nice to hear them in full team,  especially in such sad times :( Ever since I can remember Red Hot Chilli Peppers music always cheers me up :).  I hope to see you in Barcelona soon!
Melhor banda do mundo 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Idk why but this song reminds me of momentary bliss by gorillaz
catJAM
King of funk!!!!love it!!!!
Llegué a tiempo 😨😼✋
Boy, 2 average songs so far, nothing spectacullar to be honest, Jhon din't brough much to the table, very disappointed
Mais uma pro Anthony errar a letra ao vivo. ELES VOLTARAM ❤️
Mano, essa música lembra muito o One hot minute, mas especificamente "Walkabout" ( Principalmente na guitarra, acredite se quiser kkkkkkk)
The chili’s have lost it, it’s over. This sounds like a throwaway jam onstage.
Red hot é red hot simplesmente.
Só os Br nos comentários 🇧🇷🇧🇷
ZZZ
🎶🎶🎶 rhcp!
Wheres my bass MUST LEARN TIS
Another masterpiece
Qué canción maravillosa, gracias <3
necesitamos la gira por america del sur!
You know what the world will miss most? Anthony dropping a bomb in 21st century music industry is on shelling.
🤟🎸
Funk !! Just like RHCP 80’s
PERFECT...
Essa vibe maravilhosa que a banda tem, mal começou a música aqui e já da pra sentir que é excelente! <3
I love the animation! ♥
Kiedis can you like my comment?

Dave Navarro would be so proud ❤️‍🔥
This album can't drop fast enough! 😫😎

Nunca me decepcionan son fantásticos !! Los amo !!!😍❤️🌶️
I feel that poster child evokes early times of the band (that's why we find so many references to songs and demos from the past) and that suits many fans very well. I've had the song on loop since it came out. Thank you very much for your music that has saved my life in many ways. I love you and I hope you include Colombia in the Unlimited Love tour.  I hope that everything continues to be able to see them in Seville and Barcelona!
Con su arte me han levantado de la silla desde niño ❤ Los amo.
Sucks Ass!
With everything going on in the world, I'm just happy RCHP are still releasing music 🌶️

My loves
Funky Monks in full effect! My knees are weak and my head is light from the funk overload.
Love rhcp
Funk vibes
Dear Anthony, Flea, Chad and John, could you please keep doing this every month? One song every month with this delicious foxhunt for snippets, buzzin the buzz here and there? From today until...eternity? Its like falling in love every month, and its just what we need (sure I speak for all of us here) its springtime with bonus oxygen after them darn black summers and winters. Thank you.  In return I would like to dedicate this song to you. With the first listen to Poster Child this immediately came to mind... Mothers Finest with Thank You for the LOVE.  Because....thank you for the love <3
🫀
I've never been this early for an RCHP song😋
Damn! This shit is funky as fuck🥵 RHCP ♥️

Love it :)
Loving this funky jazz 😀
Why are the comments always in Spanish!? 🤔
We dig this groove🎶❤️❤️‍🔥✌️
Os caras não erram nunca <3
BORING
rhcp never disappoints me, and i love it
Sounds half like it could be on BSSM and half like OHM.
Es bellísima 🤩🤩🤩
Легенды…
Loving the classic RHCP sound.
This is AWESOME! Can not wait to see you guys live this summer! I've been in love with your music since I was a fetus in the womb! Can't wait to see John reunited 💓 💗 💕 ❤ 😭 Also, this is possibly my FAVORITE RHCP song!
this sounds so cool!! 😫
З одного боку монотонна пісня а з другого я її слухаю третій раз)
Grandpas lecturing again. Rock on!
Good Vibes
❤️❤️
por fin  !!
Flea en el bajo es increíble <3

Ficou melhor que o clipe original, dessa forma ficou muito foda. Essa música é sensacional!
Piola
At first I didn't like this song. But now, I love it

Simplemente, maravilloso 💪❤️ para comenzar el día con fuerza. 😎🎶
OHM Vibes. I Love it <3
Fuuuunnnkkkk ♥️
yeah! superfunky
слабовато
This reminds me so much of One Hot Minute, particularly the songs Melancholy Mechanics and Walkabout.
RHCP nunca decepciona, nunca erra, quem concorda respira
A good song, but does not sound like a single. Seems like a song you would find hidden in an album
Eu gosto do funk do Red Hot, mas não curti muito esse som não, esperava mais. Parece uma b-side... Espero que as outras do álbum me surpreendam mais do que as duas lançadas até agora. Mas independente disso quero mesmo é ver os caras ao vivo de novo!
the best band together again!!
Olha esse Funky delicioso
Love it
🤩🤩🤩
I love the funk
me lembra as músicas do "Mars", b-side do stadium arcadium. Funky very very <3
god
Sorry but I don't like this new song 😥
gg
Antes del millón 🥰
Supreendentemente essa banda continua com qualidade, Aposto que esse ano vai ser o melhor para os fans de RHCP
Wow.  The longer it plays, the more I like it.  That's my jam.  Love it.  ❤️
sublime.
Boring. The old peppers are gone.
Bom demais slc 🤟🏾🎧🎶
mi grupo favorito por siempre, vive por siempree 🎶💘
RHCP
Dopee this song goes hard got your head moving the whole time this song is a vibe
cara, só br nos comentários!!
Si los brasileños aman un tema, ya podes ir sabiendo que va a estar muy bueno.
BRASIL 🇧🇷❤️🇧🇷❤️
Without Kiedis' vocals this could've been a nice song.
But no hay pedo por que eres walkabout 2
Seems that John finally listened to OHM
Quanto br no chat
I absolutely hear Frusciante is here in this New songs ❤

Alô cariocas!! Isso sim que é funk!!!!!

Meh. Anthony’s verse sucks. Rest of the song is okay.
Nem ouvi todas as músicas desse álbum, mais de cara já vai entrar no meu top 3 de favoritos, ctz  1- Blood Sugar Sex Magik 2- Californication 3- Unlimited Love ?
Anthony dug himself a grave with lyrics man good luck remembering that

Hi! Check out my RHCP cover https://youtu.be/A-QYHoNGz-E
That was delicious!
OMG! Tasty!
RHCP, gracias por existir!!!❤❤❤
John de volta! Tudo se encaixa e se transforma. Pqp, que momento! 🖤✨
Ну вот и перцы)))
♥️♥️♥️♥️
On my birthday🥰🥰
Música mediana, bom jogo de palavras, deve funcionar mais ao vivo, guitarra do John anda não apareceu como se esperava nessas primeiras músicas, espero melhores.
This song will take up 3 pages in the book that comes with the album
Nice!! The whole time I was waiting for myyyy sharonaaaa
Red i love you i can have z ticket place for july for your france tourney sorry mon anglais et nul j suis français les gars 🙃😅😅
Quixoticelixer redeux!
Por qué no pusieron el vídeo en Youtube?
Love
This song will be awesome to play live. So much space to do solo, fru licks or outro jamming
SPEED FLOW
I'm blown away at the people saying it's some of their best ever.  They also saying this is throwbacks to their late 80s, early 90s stuff.  Sorry, it's more like throw aways from their early 90s stuff. No way this could ever be close to being on BSSM.
❤❤❤❤
Esa esencia no se pierde ,me encanta ,viva los RHCP desde Peruuu
One Hot Minute vibes? 🔥
Vrg q buena musica

Not a fan of this. They don’t rock at all anymore, and even their softer songs aren’t catchy anymore. Just boring mellow snoozers.
This isn’t from Black Summer?
👽
This funks giving me blood sugar sex magik feels
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Extremamente foda! Realmente esse disco promete ❤️❤️❤️❤️
O Skylab tá diferente
I heard "taco bell."
Flea nunca perde o ritmo, não é a toa que é um dos melhores baixistas do mundo.
Fraquinha essa!!
아 반갑다 새노래라니💚
I think these dudes are at their best when they push the funk to its limits and this seems like a great example!
Nunca fallan. Siguen siendo los reyes de Cali.
❤️
AMO VOCÊS RED HOT 🇧🇷✳️✨❤️
UNLIMITED LOVE!
Love from Italy 🇮🇹. RHCP 4ever
Anyone else get Walkabout vibes?
Os caras não erram
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The spirit of RHCP 😁🤘
Goals beat! Always good 🌈
Excelente, que buena mezcla de los 90s y toda la experiencia de John, la guitarra al final está buenaza. Espero que sigan así en todo el disco.
OMG i love it😀
Wow, this song is so close to this one https://youtu.be/LgkO3usqSx8
Pelo visto, vou me apaixonar por todas as músicas desse álbum 🤯💖
🤘🔥🌶
lindos amor
BR dominando nos comentários  👊🤘

YEEESSSSS Happy Friday yall

I love song❤❤
Música massa e tranquila, lembra um pouco Walkabout do One Hot Minute. Entra nos rolês com certeza
Da série, bandas sem músicas ruins... RHCP ❤❤ Só hinos!
Meus amores seguem fodas e incríveis! Amo vocês e obrigada por tudo!
só tem br nos comentários KKKKKKK
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!❤️ NO PUEDO ESPERAR POR LO QUE VIENE EN EL ALBUM🕯️
So dá Brasil nos comentários 😁✌
Tive a sorte de conhecer as músicas dessa banda com certeza uma das melhores que eu já conheci até hoje os caras entregam a música com a alma e o coração com certeza eles merecem todo sucesso e conhecimento que eles tem por esse mundo afora " I love you red hot chili Peppers "
It’s great
I LOVE YOUR MUSIC!!!!!
Awesome opossum sauce
SIMPLESMENTE A MELHOR BANDA, E TA VINDO AI O ÁLBUM DO ANO FML❤️🤟
BRABO
RHCP é a banda q eu queria escutar quando o mundo tiver acabando
Thank you Frusciante! ♥️
Que alegria em ver e escutar uma vibe com a pegada primogênita , RHCP é a melhor banda do mundo ❤
Frusciante way is pure and so strong. That is the different other guys.
Gostei mas ainda sinto falta de alguma música na vibe do Californication por exemplo...
🌶️🌶️🌶️
Loveee youuu one of the best bands ♡︎♡︎
Esperei refrão com explosão ou solinho estilo "If You Have to Ask". Essa música me lembrou bastante de Syr Psicho, principalmente o final. Agr tirando todas as comparações eu diria que é uma boa música pra escutar durante o álbum, os pontos principais estão no baixo e sintetizador, a letra do AK tá encaixando no meio, só o refrão que tá mais ou menos. Esse estilo BSSM agrada qualquer fã e eu tbm fico muito agradecido pelo som nostálgico. Aguardando anciosamente esse album. ❤️❤️❤️
존나좋네
Sounds like an OHM b-side. As a huge chili peppers fan I’m wildly disappointed with this lackluster songwriting, cliché AK lyrics and monotonous groove.
I think I'll go on a walkabout...I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper!
Муть какая-то. Надеюсь, остальной альбом будет пободрее.
Que o Frusciante nunca mais saia do RHCP 😍
RHCP tem q valorizar muitos os brasileiros! Aqui só tem comentário em português uai
This song sounds so familiar and yet super new at the same time. My god. So pumped for this album. Thank you Chili Peppers!
Los conozco desde los 11 años y son gradiosos pero nesesito algo más energía y locura, por favor y gracias por haber regresado
Precisamos ousar mais.
Posta logo tudo
migos should hop on this
Sweet

I missed the funk style of the band🎸❤️
The outro reminds me to “non believers” solo by John frusciante
EU SIMPLESMENTE AMO ESSA BANDA
os brabos tão de voltaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
❤❤❤
givin me one hot minute vibes
💜🇧🇷
Grande rhcp, los amo chicos❤❤❤
So much horsepower under the hood and they play this fruity ass shit. Speechless
Melhor banda do mundo! ❤️✳️
red hot nunca decepciona, impressionante
Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Their funkiest shit in ages, so laidback, back in stadium era they would have gone large on the chorus and solo’d heavy at the end. They just let this breathe and vibe. So chill. Well done!
That bass line is out of this world omg
Looks like the old and perfect RHCP
Continuem assim, mantendo a essência...
Que sensacion de buen rollo esta rola, el estribillo me lo imagino cantando en ronda todos agarrados de las manos en la playa a orillas del mar
😍😍😍😍🤙🤙🤙
Me hace acordar al principio a Quixoticelixer
