Season 2 please
Cuando va a salir el nuevo avance, ya quiero ver quien gana!!
Where is the 2nd part
Amma make my thoughts on it right now
Dejando al lado, quien creem qué en verdad si ganaba?
Next Part 2 Please 🙏🏻
please we need more baki
Next season?
Tamil la irruka bro
Can’t wait for next season
Did it come out yet? Ive been waiting for almost 4 years or more if there’s a crossover for the two series.
This was absolutely trash
Next PART?
I don't think I've even been this excited in a few years
Are there going to be more episodes ?? 0:22
If anyone thinks this is a fair fight first watch whole baki series and also baki fought against yujiro and pickle ,almost defeated pickle and in baki vs yujiro fight baki was the only one who can survive yujiro's attack. There is no chance anyone else can beat baki like this.
I can't believe demon back vs high blood pressure = draw
Absolute waste of time and a disgrace to both original series. If only I knew the home addresses of the person who wrote the script as well as the animation team lead. If anyone knows these people, let them know that an unstable and dangerous anime lover is looking for them.
trash
Netflix I have an request to you plz enter the jun gevaru 😢
We are waiting for the next movie...
omfg, this can't be real. I'm geeking so hard rn.
As a true fan of this anime, I am thoroughly disappointed with the fight between Jack and Raian. Jack must have his victory. After seeing Jack's lose, the rest of the anime became boring.
Make sure kengan ashura should win.
Tokita ohma should win this fight.
Dekhli hai wo bhi Hindi mei agar dekhna chahte ho to 2k likes complete karo
This was so boring. How did Netflix sign this off?
У меня в профиле есть этот фильм
the shit was ass
Woww i cant wait to watch itt a dream come true
I mean it was ok… little to cringe.
After watching this, I'm disappointed. did you do it for 12-year-olds?
My dream has come true. All i what now is a 2d fighting arcade game .
just watched it the fights  where good
Good
When the second  episode  will come
Baki Dou 107.5 is a prequel chapter to this crossover. It covers the story of young Doppo vs Saw Paing's father.
This was just a promotion for both the series. It was disappointing because it didn't take power scaling into account. Anyone who has read both baki and ashura manga knows that kengan ashura characters don't stand a chance against baki characters. Pathetic
It should be a series, not a movie
Disappointing
Nice works. And i would like to say the fighting scene quite good but its not impressive as usual like in baki hanma or kengan ashura. This movie atleast should be 1 hours 30 minutes instead of 1 hours. The fighting scene end fast than usually either kengan ashura or baki hanma. They need to improve fighting scene. Most of it just fighting with no brain. While in baki hanma or kengan ashura sometimes they use their head to knock their enemies. And lastly, yujiro hanma should fight agito kanoh. That will makes masterpiece
Edits with Phonk are going to have a field day with this one.
Best anime movie of the year!!!!!!!!! Thank you for this!!!! It was an amazing fight!!!!!!!!!!
作画はちょっと、ん？でしたがストーリーはごく至ってシンプルでめっちゃおもろかったです！　 他にも見たいカードいっぱいあるので是非2作って欲しいです。
When comes season 2 or part 2?
Today is the day!
Netflix  I have never been one to complain but u did not do good To this crossover 😢
saw it...Disappointed af:  poor writing.  poor animation.  extensively fast pace.  poor narration.  No back-story whatsoever.  Baki fighters got nerf.  ending was very forced on both ends.  crossovers are sometimes kinda hard to watch, especially if they are fighting, or challenging each other in whatever it is. This "we need to do both animes justice".
What a let down. I was so hyped but they ruined it. Animation was shitty and no way baki is losing to ohma. We all know baki is way ahead ohmas leauge. There is no direction. I am highly disappointed
Worst movie
Finally one more reason to live
This was Shit bruv
Netflix: They start something good and then they make it shit 💩 💩💩💩🛑🚧🛑
so ein müll was ohr da gemacht habt. hab mich so darauf gefreut und das ist alles ?
Einfach schlecht eine beleidigungen für beide Serien, schlecht gezeichnet und schlecht umgesetzt
Trash you nerf baki Netflix BIG L
Is was fun fam service amd i liked every second of it. Thx for nexflix, the animation studios and the creator of the 2 univers.
Alright, Netflix, you cooked with this. This was absolute gas. I pray that the next time you make something like this and use a nut's that there will be a second part. I pray you guys give us 4 45-minute episodes each and a minimum of 6 episodes. I don't know, maybe you guys can stretch it out to being its own full series by itself. But this was straight gas. I pray you do most stuff like this specifically for kengun Ashura and Baki
Today is the day
Jack lost
He should have won the fight, we know he will win the fight, please let the story be handled well
Где выход
ya pa cuando a que hora
Its still not out there
ITS TODAYYYYY
So wheres it?
Comes out tmrrrr let’s goo
We got kengan ashura vs baki before gta 6 😭😤
Watching this will make our balls grow twice as big and if you are a female you gonna get pregnant
Yujiro vs pickle - the death fight 💀
Tomorrow Boys.. WE GET TO SEE GREATNESS!
The anime has to be different because its too different styles of work. Its gonna be very interesting to say the least
One more dayy
GUYS WHAT ABOUT KENGAN ASHURA SEASON 3? Anyone pls help
Hahahah Baki would absolutely DEMOLISH Ohma! Not going to give any spoilers, but anyone serious about Anime and specifically these two series knows it didn't happen and where each of them end up... Or rather don't!  While I personally would watch whatever either are put out, they're two completely different worlds and each have their own level of impossibilities and degree of fiction, but I'll watch either as both were done very well!
Please tell me that jack hanma is gonna have his manga height of 243cm its unlikely but i hope
Yujiro vs Fang would be wild.
Excited for jack hanma😎
DAMN!!!!
First thing I thought about when finishing both of these shows
1.8m views says a lot of good creative Content.
Let‘s go 1 week to go
Ohma force 💪 like
New season coming ?
Baaaaaakiii
Crossover nobody asked for but needed
LETSS GOOOO
OMG CANT WAITTTTTTTT
Fuck is this
But is this in 3 or 2D? Personally I don’t like the 3D in animation, so hopefully they do not use too much of it :/
Thank god they made it in baki style
Its is a season or a movie🤔
guys from kengan have a better chance on defeating the raitai chinese team than hanma team. like FR. i'd still watch it though >)
It's hard to imagine Baki losing to Ohma at this point, but that's never stopped a crossover fight before.
Baki wins easy
My Life Is Complete 🫶🏽❤️‍🔥✨
Man I was thinks about this last year
Baki finna burn the kitchen down with this one 😭🙏
ohmaaaaa
😎😎😎
1 hour and 6 minutes, i cannot wait for this movie !!!!!
Please dub in movie
DON’T LIE TO ME
Holy shit
surely baki would KILL him
Swear I watch this mf every other week like it’s gonna speed up time 💀
June 6 awe im hyped.
Tai
A few match ups I would want to see….   Lihito vs Sikorsky  Bando vs Spec Kuroki vs Dorian Nikaido Ren vs Doyle Hatsumi vs Shibukawa Igari vs Sekibayashi  Yanagi vs Inaba  I need a life….
Waiting for sea king retsu next boxing fight...
Baki won easily because his fighting skills is too much then kengan his seed is literally incredible baki dorch many bullets his brain is demon brain baki won easily against kengan
Baki is overpowered ❤️‍🔥
Fang vs yujiro would be 🔥
Im conflicted i dont know who's ass i wana see kicked more Hanma or Ohma
This is unReal how is this cannon they never had any intaractions or mentions of them being part of  the same universe
If a single punch will be landed a 100% that an ancient fact will be talked about for the entire episode
DAMN... MY HEART ITS GETTING DOKI" DAMMIT!!!
Baki universe is a trash universe.
Team OHMA❤
AND THE WINNER IS BAKI HANMA 👍
So this is gonna happen for real I see. Interesting. Well ,besides Yujiro being the only character I like from baki, I already have my favorite. Kegan ashura>baki  Ohma>>baki
Thank you Netflix.
No words can define this phenomenon, ❤❤❤ I will be looking forward to watch this wonderful animation👌.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m hype but I believe they would  be interrupted perhaps… haha   Anyways this a win for all us…
What in the holy f****ng sh&/ is going on in 2024!? I swear I just woke up from a dream where Kendrick and Drake had a rap battle and Im about to go right back to sleep💀🙏
WE CAN’T EVEN WAIT FOR THIS LOONGGGGGGGG
This is really unfair despite kengan ashura are based on MMA skills while Baki is based on fictional power of the beast. Although both of them are the best Men’s anime.
The fact is that  They don't understand it's totally different level szzzz of power we are talking about  It's like humans vs super humans
i wish  granrodeo   does the ed or op for this .
We got Ashura vs The ogre's son before gta 6 😂.
Vcl
Hopefully they make the Food Wars X One Piece crossover next
Yooo no way
Baki💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💯💯💯💯💯
ok netflix you cooked 🧑‍🍳
It woulld be funny if someone like Machio from dumbell girls suddenly pop out glowing as a god
Ohma tokita is the best 🗿🔥
I never watched the show with Kengan. Is he really that good to go against Baki? I feel like Baki isn’t even human with some of the stuff he pulls
I will not pinch myself. I will not snap out of this dream.
Next we need a superman vs omni man vs homelander. Netflix and Amazon collab.
This sounds kinda boring honestly cuz Baki would definitely wipe the floor with ease
can we get the second season od kengan ashura before? oô
Take my money
IMPOSIBLE!
KENGAN ASURA >>>>> baki
NO FUCKING WAY
Baki would win this fight.. Coz he is in his domain.. Just look at the animation style... 😂
enter tsuyoshi please
baki will win 🤷 the world powers surrendered to his father, who lost to baki. gg kengan and your little underground battles
Please do Itachi vs obito and close the debate between fan's
Yujiro vs connector would be fair fight 🤔
Wow yaar maja aa jayega
It’s gonna be interesting.
Yes... The technique of years trained  The power of scars that cut the skin and harden the spirit  The history that serves as the wood that stokes the flame of battle in their hearts  This is not going to be a fight, not a clash, not a duel, this is going to be a collision of hearts Of minds Of pure fighting spirit  This is going to be a  Full Blown Battle.
Fucking HYPPEEEEE
I really thought it was a fan made video 😭😭😭😭🔥
ohma gon wup dat boi azzzzzz
They're gonna nerf baki characters
i hope to see Kanoh vs Yujiro only
Baki is stronger
This is insane bro xD
If this for real ani’t know way Baki just overkill tokita make that shit fair we all fans of both series make that shit a bloody fight and a draw some how fuck you talking about😂😂❤💯no 🧢
Whaaaaat it is real? That’s crazy
*NOICE*
Pickle ???
A time to be alive
Baki bout to get nerfed
I didn’t even know this shit was possible then I suddenly see it on my recommendations. I’m so ducking pumped
❤❤
best crossover
Dream 🥹
Money's on bakki though
Is this real chad ?
Is this true man ? i feel like i’m dreaming a day ? can’t wait to see 2 anime fav crossoverr big fan big love big idol ❤❤❤❤
It's that real?
is this the mike tyson vs mohammed ali of anime
This is like a good ufc card with good matchups!!!
Baki wins easily and if he doesn’t win shit is trash.
it's gonna be undefined or a tie. Dont get your hopes up!
Baki got this in the bag
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!!!!
yo yo yo yo YO YO YO YO YO BRO!!!!
Baki win
This is some alien vs predator level shit
Im calling it now. We all know that was pickle that interfered
Baki ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Better not that lunatic win over OHMA
Pickle , yujiro , mushashi 🗿
Where's Takeshi Wakatsuki and Agito Kanoh
heal yeah🔥🔥
I like ohma but he's getting dogwalked
Как же я счастлив!
Currently pissing and shiting rn
I LITERALLY JUST FINISHED BAKI AND THOUGHT ABOUT WATCHING KEGEN 💀 (THEN I COME TO WATCH THIS)
I recommended this.
sei como tu e até o medo saber enfrentar sem qualquer segredo
Its alomst june now its may
I so hope it ends in a draw
Here comes the prisoners and they want to taste defeat.
Team Baki!!!
What?
Bro they haven’t even finished kengan😭 but okay….. baki wins😈
My birthday dates are ready to 6 June 💥🤍
Yujiro walking casually
kengan ahsura was better but baki characters are way stronger
They’re gonna Nerf baki
No man
Man wiz and broomstick must be foaming at the mouth after seeing that Netflix beat them to this fight 😂😂😂😂
I feel like Baki Has waaaaay more experience fighting that he’ll win. But, Kengan Omega Ohma would win for sure.
THIS right here proves WE CAN GETY A GOKU V SAITAMA
For real????? BRUHHHHHHH LETS GOOOOO!!!!
cool
I hope this is not a versus, my 2 favorite characters battling against each other, not sure i will like this at all
Ohma. Against Baki. I didn't know I wanted to see it just until now.
A man pushing 30 vs a teenager, so can't wait to see that
Ohma will fuck the shit out of baki😂😂
God has answered our prayers or it’s a April fools
The feats in Baki are just way past anything in the Kengan universe. Cool idea and all but just doesn’t make sense combining the two.
Yeeeaahhhhhh!!!!!
Eu vi que esse filme vai ter 1h e 2m de duração
Bro dream match
animation from kengan please
NO WAY
Hindi Dubbed Hoga kya ????
Oooooo
Baki will demolish Tokita if they fight.
Bunu hep istemişimdir
Mücadelemiz efsane olacak
The fights in Baki are kind of dumb, While the fights in Kengan Asura are more grounded. So I'm not really sure how this will work.
CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS
like mordecai and rigby said in the regular show "WOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAH"
Ain't no way😮
Can't wait
Baki animation is🤮
NOOOOOO WAYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will yujiro and other will be in it ???
Greatest Crossover this year LFG!!!!!!!!!!💯💯💯💯🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥
Laaah... Kayaknya bakal keren. Asal yujiro ga intervensi. Haha
THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIIIIIIIC! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩
Chat is this real?
While there is is a big difference i still root for ohma, but something tells me it is still an unfair fight looking at both storylines.
bro cannot wait hen ohma sees yujiro or pickle
Time kangna ashna
Filler while we wait for the next season of baki
I can’t wait for this! But I do get a feeling that there won’t be a clear winner. As the creators wouldn’t want to offend either fandom.   They’ll probably have an epic fight and their match will either get interrupted or both will acknowledge the strengths of the other and return to work on their own abilities. Only time will tell tho.
Please make it in 3D like Kengan Ashura and not poorly animated like Baki.
If yall ready for this same as me, give a hell yeah.
I think this will come down to tactical experience.  I don't see how this will work. Either buff ohma or nerf baki.  The baki world is just unreal :,). That world doesn't take into consideration stamina and after fight injuries at all. Fuckn get shot in the legs and as if nothing happens.  Completely two different worlds The Kengan world is way more realistic in some sense(obviously, both are unrealistic in their own aspects). The kengan world takes into fight stamina m, more explanation to the fights and builds of the fighters. Plus, fighters rack up damage, which is cool.  That's why i prefer Kengan fights.  But I love baki so much. I've watched all season on GoGo anime before the netflix ones.
Wow...
Netflix thankyou so much ❤️
No way 💀
This fight gonna be like Baki Hanma vs Kaku Shunsei.
anime collabs are best thing we could ask for
2 demon will clash and see who's own the throne
Since both creators probably want their guy to win here’s a compromise            Yujiro wins
Its happening
Oh this is real. Heart.exe has crashed
welcome to "how to nerf baki verse"
Finally kengan ashura will improve their animation 😮‍💨
Is this real?
High key Baki 😅
Oh shit, ooohhhh shhuiitttt, lettes fucking gooooo😊
no fucking way
We need ONE winner. We don’t want NO LAME ASS TIE. You know what to do Netflix. Give us a show & ONE winner.
Netflix about to freeze up on june 6 😂
Are they ever gonna finish ashra season 3 there’s 2 more days of the tournament
But the Saddest part was Ohma's conclusion is heart breaking 💔💔 [[The most realistic ending Kengen Ashura 1 had]]
favoritism baki wins
Baki characters seems so much more stronger than Kengan Ashura characters.. like i cant see anybody from KA touching Olivia let alone Yujiro
콜라보 실화냐 ㄷㄷ
We need Yujiro vs Collector
baki is more strong and fast but the kengan fighs are more cooler. I just hope they keep kengan fighting styles.
Quem conhece os 2 animes sabe muito bem que é impossível o Ohma vencer o Baki
Baki would win obviously because baki universe is literaly BROKEN while kengan ashura is somewhat realistic
Baki gonna get nerfed lol just to fight on his level and make it hard
Ohma tokita
What millions want is coming😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉
Death battle coming 😨
One punch man vs this anime😂😂
It's time for ohma beat up from daddy yujiro 😂
Beleza Netflix, agora faz um game de baki pra ontem, é um pecado um anime de luta tão famoso não ter um game de luta que preste.
I’m feeling the effects of masculinity, testosterone. I wanna go to WAR! I want a LIGHTSABER! I’M A MAN! WAR!
The animation should be in kengan ashura style
pls dubbed in hindi
No way this is real. It's fucking real.
Nah bro ohma doesnt have a chance
what the fucking crossover of the century
It's over for Ashura
Wait is this real?? No way netflix is doing this
Netflix and that great budget?
Ohama is no where near baki if he even tries to touch his hair then Baki will pound him.
No freaking way.
if this is real im buying premium netflix or whatever the most expensive supscription is
Bro I would get Netflix if they just give me Luther Strode
DAMMMNNN
well it would be even great if we can see you zero on my fighting that great elder of Kangana Ashura .   hahahaahahahahahaahahhaahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahah.......... cant stop thinking about it man .... hahahahahahahahahahhahaahahahahahahahahaha
I never dreamt about it I can't believe that this is happening someone just slap me 100 times .
Yujiro will appear outta nowhere Nd give both of them ass whooping, I'm sure. Teamup to survive haha 😅
My body got chill seeing this🥶😱
My 2 favorite anime
Mordecai and Rigby vs the Baki and Kengan verse
We Want Goku vs Saitama 🥶
Where can I place bets?
Baki suck and he not that good not like yujiro him he beat a army with is bare hand baki he do nothing pickle beat is ass easy and what is so weird not like some after baki became more OP thst pickle boolshit just the prductor probably abuse the ending just for make baki equal to yujiro oterwise baki cant never win vs is father all the time he never do dmg vs him
Whaaaaaaaaat!!!! Yeaaaaaaah!!!! Ooookkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!! ❤
WTH! How? Isn’t Omha dead?
Now i wanna see juhiro hanma in record of ragnarök
when is record of ragnarok season 3 releasing
Baki will be in 3d or ohma in 2d?
2 lagend fighter is come back!
Ohma is not in 3D in the last shot. He looks a bit different. Looks like team Baki scored a point in that area XD
Team Ohma
Jack vs raihn bouta go crazy
Ayo Netflix y’all going too hard smh so much anime and other stuff to catch up on what’s next squid games season 2 shessh. Yeaaa take my money.
No way bro this is actually gonna be hype asf
So much potential with this. Amazing to see what's in the works here!
This means that Baki and "How Heavy are the Dumbbells That You Lift" will be in the same universe.
Nah it’s saying an 1h for 2 weeks
Since when did anime’s calab
April fools passed already
To quote Wiz from Death Battle … “All right, the combatants are set. Let’s end this debate once and for all.”
Holly fork ))), this is going to be epic )))
Please don't pinch me ... I don't want to wake up
Really hope they use Kengan style of art
😮😮😮😮😮
The greatest fighter's of all time are about to clash
we all know who's gonna win Baki
Is it a dream?
Yujiro: "Nah, I'd win."    But actually wins
Baki got it.
idk why neflix do a fan made, everyones knows that baki slap Ohma 😤😤
Holy crap😍
ıs this a joke 😄
Finally yes We want to see a real nasty fight
WHAT???????????
April fools or what? Omg i hope it's true
YUHHH
Money on Baki
Nico style ❤❤❤❤
Holy sh*t! It’s like a dream come true baki all the way bois!
Is it a movie a season answer me dammit!
Baki characters way to strong
I want to stay alive for this.
It is finally coming!!! (Me only 12 and watching Baki and Kengan Ashura
So pumpt for that…
Não acredito
baki negs
Nah we got kengen vs baki before gta 6
Baki or ohma who is stronger 👇
Please do not use the Kengan Commentators for the battles.
İf this is a joke im gonna eat my all grandmothers nail
Now I have to watch it
Screw Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson, THIS is the fight I’m looking forward to this summer.
Kengen verse gets the win
and Netflix drop it in my birthday
😵‍💫😲
let me guess... they draw and become friends
HOLD UP HOLD UP HOL FUP!!!!IM ON FIRE 🔥 🔥 AHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHAT LETS GOOO
Does anyone actually think Ohoma could beat Baki because you could probably sell your blood with how much cope is in it. 😂
When that will come out
3D zoado vs 2D +ou- kkkkkkkk
What the hell? No comment 🖤.
Finish kengan ashura and after go for this shit
Que????  Enserio???  🤯🤯😱  Soy fan de Kengan Ashura
This will finally decide who is the strongest out of the two no need to watch people debating about who will win ,Netflix will...
How is this real..
We’re getting anime crossover events before gta6.
Netflix gay
😮
I JUST GOT INTO THIS SERIES AND WONDERED WHOD WIN 😭 what is this timing 💀
Damn It's relesaing on my bd
Baki easy buddy
Ohma and Baki staring at each other is more entertaining than all of The Marvels.
Supa epic boss
I thought it was fake. OMG its like Dream become reality
Wtf seriously
Agito vs yujiro next 😁
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat this can’t be real 😭
MAAAAAhhhh BAAAWWWLLLLLSSSSS. Well.  Renewing Netflix.....AGAIN (X2000)
Baki obviously wins
Calling it: Its gonna be a tie.Super fun fight...but a tie
I thought it was April Fools, but i was wrong
im literally frothing for this
I love you Netflix!
Honestly I hope neither of them wins and it becomes an even tie
excellente idea 👍👍👍👍
What in the multiverse is this can’t wait to see baki in action
Baki finna spank that baby
Can't believe they moving forward with this. Only thing u wish it was done in kengans cell animation and not the Baki animation. Kengans animation looks more intricate. Baki when they do moves  they do too many cuts instead of showing the moves animated from beginning to end.
Nahhhhhh lets go
Yo this will become a bloody movie
Bro, tell me this isn’t an April fools joke
Yoooo
😵‍💫😵‍💫😱😱🤯🤯🤯
This is gonna suck!!!! I’m not talking about the series I’m talking about the outcome of this fight!!! The first punch will break all of reality, that’s how intense this is!!!
Koroki bout to clap Yojiro hahaha
I am not a biased fan but Kengan verse is just too much for Baki  Examples:  Muteba is a deadlier Gaia  Kure Raian is stronger and scarier than Jack Hanma  Ohma is more mature and better fighter than Baki  Julius Reinhold is easily stronger than Biscuit Oliva  Kanoh Agito is much nore competent and lived up to the hype than Retsu  Shen Wulong has more experience and techniques than Yujiro Hanma even with rhe Demon back  Wakatsuki blast core is more powerful than Katsumi mach punch
Thank God it’s not cg and it’s bakis style
We already know that nobody is going to win. They will find a way to make this a draw.
What year plss
im curious about Kuroki Gensai and Yujiro Hanma's fight
This is cool but if Baki doesn’t win it slick won’t makes sense he fought Pickle and Yujiro nobody can faze him unless they can beat Pickle or Yujiro and we all know the only person who can do that is god😂  Kengan is good but he’s not on Baki level not even in the same universe they made him too op Kengan is gonna have to hit him harder than Pickle or Yujiro which is impossible Baki is way too durable way too strong and has too much skill he fights people that will flick Kengan and kill him  Kengan vs Jack would be better Jack is op in some areas but also has major flaws that balance him out Baki has no flaws you’re either better than him or you’re just not and Kengan just not😂………… he might have a chance if Baki gets poisoned again lol
If baki wins.  I'm gonna kms
Hanma blood is the demon blood..
Look, i LOVE the kengan ashura manga, and i haven't even seen any baki, but I'm pretty sure baki slaps ohma around like a slice of cheese.
AMAIZING..I CANT WAIT..
thank you
When will it be released in Italy?
What ? Are you for real?
Baki easily beats everyone in the Kengan universe.
Yessirrrrrrr
They gonna have to nerf baki so much 💀
OMG Christmas present comes early this year
Giving us every fight except the one we want 😑
Damn i cant wait
Yoooo dis can’t be happening
No way
Baki would absolutely smoke all of Kengan.
BAKI BOUT CATCH ANOTHER BODYYYY 😂
Dreams do come true !
WHAAAT? Let's go!!!
WTF ???? i don't want to look that
Bro
Death Battle: Netflix: Fine. I’ll do it myself
If they pull the gag where Kazzy is seen as hyper competent but even Yujiro falls for it, I swear
NO PUEDO ESPERAR TANTO 😞
Goku vs saitama next......
**Insert kingpin clicking pen meme in here**
BAKI
wow
The crossover that I didnt expect but im here for it!
WATCHING ITX W
fuck i am dying😍🥵🥵
Is Baki the last fighter in Kengan
animation looks terrible
Is this real?????
No way….
but why only for 1 hour 💔
SAQUEN EPISODIOS DE EL KENGA ASHURA MAS Y MASSSSSS
WTF??!!
para cuando el arco de musashi miyamoto
wow
If Baki loses. What was the point of even watching it.
This is going to be one hell of a birthday present Netflix now I can’t wait for my birthday 🎉
Can't wait to see Ohma fighting Baki over who is going to make the imaginary tofu soup.
All i have to say is PLEASE GIVE OHMA A HANMA BLOOD BOOST PLEASE NETFLIX- Ohma isnt a bad fighter- he isnt a shittu fighter- He isnt some Stupdly OP Human that has the blood to match a damn God itsefl. PLEASE GIVE IHMA A BOOST
Well as Baki is I’m sure fan favorite this could go either way
But isnt Ohma dead already?
Holy shit. There hasn't been a crossover like this since Timmy Turner and Jimmy neutron
on. my b day no fuckin way this is going to be crazy
Is this real😂
Man this is going to be legendary
Wait a minute...this is REAL???!!!😮
スマスロで出るやろな
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks Netflix or his creator it's like dream 🥹
Ab Kaise Bhi Krke June 6 Thak Zinda Rehna ha
Baki se va a papear a Ohma
Baki wins if its legit.
WTF IS THIS!!! i quote (never in my life have i needed something so mutch and never known until i received it) (DBZ abriged vegeta: broly saga)
2024 anyone?
Is this real someone plz confirm 😭
Baki winning 100%
So a movie about Baki beating up off brand Baki nice 💪🏽
More hyped for this than the Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson fight
Fan service which mean it will end duel no one wins
Kengan in 2d😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫omg
no wayyyyyy
Why ohma ugly
They look a LOT alike
I got 100 on Baki 💪🏾
fml YES! Meine Träume wurden erhört!
I like kengan more than Baki, but HOW THE HELL IS OMAH GOING TO BEAT BAKI???
Where’s the legendary swordsman arc man
Baki vs ohma goddamn 😱 all hell will breaks loose awesome I can't wait to watch it let's go I'm all fired up now 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
A lot of yall bringing up Yujiro but there's a character that can definitely match him in the kengan manga
きたぁ！
Where’s the legendary swordsman arc man
가슴이 웅장해진다
Actually this is bullshıt. These two were not even in the same universe. There is not the slightest logic in BAKİ. Kengan also had this partially. This will negatively affect the quality of the kengan.
before gta6
gave me chills, i wonder if the connector will be involved
Me screaming  like a little girl at 5am
드디어 오는건가,,,
I did not think this was real when I first heard about it
This is real. But at the same time I can’t believe it.
I love both characters but to be honest, I think Baki would win because his character arch is more developed then Kengan. Netflix has not even finish Kengan tournament yet. I can't measure his true skills compared to Baki.
How are they in the same universe 🥴
Bro they should just make an anime of both these guys in the same universe
Now we need goku vs saitama
Orochhi doppo vs ogre😂🤧🤧🤧
Been posting it to death battles for years, guess Netflix has to do it
Goku, eta vaina e` seria...tututu tu tutu...♫♪
Baki's art style, Baki winning
Is this real chat?
Aaayyoooooooo!!!!!
Everybody is a gangster until Yujiro Hanma arrives
This will be good with Kengan Ashura animation. If Baki studio is doing it, it will suck.
Wey, son dos versos que no se topan para nada, uno más realista y el otro más fantasioso. Mejor ya animen la tercera temporada que quiero ver como el ohma y el cosmo se agarran a vergazos con grappling
DUDE !!!!! Ik !!! DUDE!!! IK !!!!! DUUUUUUUUUDEEEEEE!! I KNOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW !!!! .
I dont really like Ohma a lot but I literally hate that other femboy.
Baki will win, I think
wth omg
100% gonna be a draw to piss us off, they gonna both get knocked out same time
looks like ima have to watch kengan
it could be anyone but i fully believe that kengan is gonna win
Cuando saldrá la tercer temporada de récord of ragnarok
At least they not wasting potential, please no more metaphorical wins for baki just hands, a winner, and a loser. None of this "baki could have won" bs please
First GTA 6 trailer now this hell yea this a dream for sure😴
Me and my brother will be watching this when it comes out such a great show the fights are awsome!
this is what we’ve been debating on for years now😂😂😂 and look wtf netflix has done
If this is not a fan animation video, please tell me the truth that this is real
Skills vs power
Just knew it one day we would see them fight 💪🏼🔥
Siuuuuuu
Tokito wins
Baki win
Is this real? 😢😢😢❤❤❤
What is happening!
baki can't beat kengan
Baki hands down taking Ohma's ass.
Please don't do IT in baki shitty "fight" style. I Hope that they will maintain the attention to detail as in Kengan ashura.
Heureusement que l adaptation aura lieu dans l animation style Baki et pas style Kengan.
I'm not really wanting complex storytelling. I'm just looking for awesomely animated, badass consecutive fights. Just one after the other of kengan and baki characters fighting. That would be amazing
Is this real?
Netflix can do that with other anime as well audience will be super happy to see hells paradise and ninja kamui together 🎉😂😅
This is the most random thing for today lol
Baki doesn't feel possible, ik Baki has a bigger fanbase but all my support is for TOKITA OHMA
I want this match up :  - Ohma vs Baki  - Gensai vs Yujiro - Agito vs Pickle  - Julius vs Olivera - Gaolang vs Retsu - Raian vs Jack - Wakatsuki vs Hanayama - Sen vs Orochi - Akoya vs Gouki  Tell me who's gonna win
By the comments looks like I’m not the only one hyped about this.
This is officially going to be the dumbest anime available
The f. Netflix is doing amazing things here! :D
so long as they play that baki confrontation OST when these two meet im good
yoooooooo!!!!!!
is this for fucking real
Every man’s dream. Having the two best pro anime fighters brawl out. No special powers, no magic. Just fist on fist. 😤😳 can’t wait…… June 6
Tunometecabrasaramambiche 😮
not april fool?
Team Ohma √
bruhhhhh wow
겁나기대된다!~!!
Incoming ROR animation 💀
If the characters come together, Mortal Kombat will become the decisive battle before Raiden Bee returns time
I just read it's a 6 part series
Ummm but how is this fair?😢
範馬勇次郎 vs 繋がる者が見たい
Ohma wins, GG
WHAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?
Amazing  and still I am waiting for blue eye samurai 2 season
WTF!
The animation should be a mix of both worlds. If it's only Baki style, it will definitely $uck. Same with the forthcoming season (Baki Dou). The previous ones left a lot to be desired...
Baki wins…. Close fight but he doesn’t even win the Kengan but yet suppose to beat Baki!?!?
Niko style vs demon back🔥
I was wondering which artstyle they would pick if they had a collab.
Baki is too much of a fairy tale. Kengan is more realistic. I believe the crossover will look really weird
Hopefully they don’t screw up the animation like how it did with Baki vs Yujiro
The way it looks so far seems pretty good to me. T.T
Nah baki wins or draws
This is real ? Yo I so hypped to see that !
No dount oman is best but as of now baki is at phenomenal level , after all wo dansours and usse bhi bade creatures jaise logo ko deal kiya hain
ohma negs
Wait that's not ohma😭
This Come out on my birthday 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pa cuando Baki en TEKKEN 8
Finally These Shows Face Together Both is a masterpiece
Oha süperrrr, iki animede zirveydi GERÇEKÇİ DÖVÜŞ animesi olarak, ikiside ortak yapım HARİKA YA... Netflix cidden bu işi biliyor, 10numara yetişkinlere göre animeleri mevcut...
Cant wait for baki s musashi miyamoto arc!!
We are waiting for season 3 of kengan ashura Not this
"The battle will be LEGENDARY!"
Can't wait for this 🔥
They have to make baki as the winner
😭 yeaaah yes baby
i like how no one seems to feel that yujiro and fang of metsudo should have a fight and who would win
Advance vs Demon back 🔥👌🏻🔥
F—————-k !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHA
The collaboration we never expected.
After seeing this, I'd like for Kengan Ashura, to get a bigger budget, so the characters will have this animation
Well it's about to go down
Siuuuuuuuuu
NO 3D PLEASEEE
Holy fuck
baki gonna win
🔥⚡🔥⚡🔥 Niko Style vs the Demon Brain 🧠 Fang vs Picul?... The 1 above all the Ogre
Anime's WRESTLEMANIA
Yoooooooooooooooo
Baki et Kengan c’est similaire mais vraiment différente Baki s’est amélioré grâce à ses shadow boxing tandis que dans l’univers kengan c’est loin de la réalité ça et notons bien que Baki est populaire que kengan mais kengan est bcp plus intéressant que Baki à mon avis bcp plus d’action j’espère que Ohma lui ferai qu’un bien petit boucher Baki 😎😎
I just finshed baki season 3 so nos seeing this announcement made me want to start kengan ashura
Now we just need an anime adaptation for Tough by Tetsuya Saruwatari.
OMG this going to be awesome
This is gonna be sick🔥🔥🔥
If Baki doesn’t win …. I’m kinda going to be pissed off 😭😭
demon heart vs heart attack
Baki or ashura  Place ur bets people 👇🏾
Cant wait for this
Omg is this really happening.. but we all know Baki wins ain’t no way is the other way around but it’s a good crossover
Why
This animation bouta be history ong. 🗣️🔥📖⏳
OHMA LOOKS SO BAD😭
Jack vs raian would be the most bloodiest fight
This battle between animes will be epic
Trás mas Lookism, só teve só 8 episódios
In guessing were jusy gonna ignore sbr huh?
nice!
This is the anime version of Hulk Hogan vs Andre the Giant, it's that level of hype.
why
Is this real :OOOOO  I do enjoy kengan ashura more than baki tbh.. especially after bakis last weak episodes..
How about the Ogre vs. both of them?
This is CRAZY 😱😱🤯🤯🤯
no wayyyyyyyyy
Baki wins as baki verse is more strong than kengan's verse . jack hanma can easily defeat anyone of kengan verse so if u compare the levels baki got stronger characters
Is this a fever dream?
Yujiro for the Win!
This is awesome!
It looks insane  might be the only kengan ashura sense am gonna watch cause it aint 3d
No way 🔥
chat is this real? i cant belive it lol
Baki hanma always best❤
Then Goku pulls up...
Their power scales are not equal.Baki universe can 1 hit to kengan universe.
From what I've seen, there's no way Baki loses. Niko style is good but it ain't as good as Baki .
작화는 바키작화구나.. 내심 켄간아슈라 작화길 바랬는데..그래도 ㅈㄴ기대된다
This would silence all the Anime Debators and i'm here for it
Baki's full story got to play out but we never got to see how Ohma's story ended😢. Still excited but sad lol the plot got so good
I’ve been waiting for this to happen let’s go!!
I wish they finished KENGAN,  before doing this
치열하게 싸우다가 무승부나겟네 ㅋㅋ
Is this real happen?
I can’t believe this is actually happening
Man this battle gonna be so freaking Wild  I'm exited to watch yl 💗🔥
Rip Kengan
I don't care much about design but keep the  kengan ashura styles fight.  Baki fights are just slideshows and explanation.
I will not be ok with Baki losing or even tieing. I want a great fight, but for baki to ultimately win. Nothing else will be satisfying. Baki was just named the strongest in the world. If he ties or loses it would be extremely distasteful.
How is this happening? First DanDaDan anow this? Anime this year is looking really interesting.
Shitt.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
if they do this type of animes then i NEED TO SEE Vegito vs Gogeta
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
there's no way this is happening lmao
Meme si ils vont grave diminuer la force de baki pour équilibrer
No way
One Punch Man Ssn 3 when :(
as much as I want to see more battles I don't care for them to fight, at least not right now.  Kengan has just started while Baki won the fight against his father. So it's not a balanced fight
Thank you Netflix
Baki sola MN fato
Godzilla vs Kingkong anime version
Spoiler Baki wins
Notice: Baki Hanma vs. *Kengan Ashura* not only Ohma Tokita, all the fighters at once, lol. I mean, it's not like literally can't stomp the verse. Even 13 yo Baki solos.
Ohma is not ready for baki tho💀
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT ! PERFECT
This literally a fucking dream come true   This what happens when animators listen to the fandom
Baki Meet Ohma , "do you bleed ?"
Holy shit i thought this was a troll
Then Kenshiro walks up and asks what these youngsters are doing.
Gtfoh… its bout to be crazy!
I cannot believe this is being made, and i can't express how glad I am that it is
Netflix Is becoming crunshirol but better love it
this is gonna cause so much chaos with the outcome of the battle
Team Baki all day
OMG 😍
Wooooooooow ❤️‍🔥
😮😮😮😮😮
Even why I don’t how this going to work but care when going to make more Baki?
What the hell?  This is a real thing?  lol Random as hell.  Can we get Netflix to just start doing this for a bunch of matchups like DeathBattle without the fake research and with better production value?
How this going to work anyway   lol like are  they in the same universe????????
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!
Hope Ohma wins cuz Baki is so boring charter as hell
No fucking way
This is big I'm taking bets now 🎉🎉🎉
ooh me vengo
NO WAYYY
Hace tiempo que no siento tantas expectativas por un lanzamiento.
Necesitamos que el intro sea el Tunometecabrasarambiche 🙏
i don't believe it. It must be some kind of joke.
lets goooo, keep it up!
Ain't no way
All im saying is, Kengan skipped P.P training.
Okay so baki wins. this is pointless. Kengan Ashura isn't even on the same unrealistic level as baki its super grounded in actual injuries etc Baki some dude loses an arm and his fighting spirit creates a new one out of thin air that somehow looks like a katana that can talk named Moegi thats actually the ancestral spirit of yujiro and baki named Poodoo hanma now baki can read the future as he fights and can predict 3 seconds in advance what will happen because poodoo is on his side but OH NO PICKLE ATE HIS INVISIBLE ARM SO NOW BAKI HAS TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL ODDS BUT THEN OH NO! HERE COMES THE SPIRIT OF HIS GRANDFATHER WEARING A DRESS AND NOW BAKI IS GOD TIER RIPPING POLAR BEAR HEARTS OUT AND *@$$&* WTF IS THIS EVEN AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION!?
We got baki vs ashura before gta 6 bruh
Fuck Yeah!
i need this
spoiler, vai dar empate
better see baki in kengan style so we dont just watch a damn slideshow  where every punch is a swipe
Man this is cool.. BUT OVER MYAMOTO MUSASHI ARC? bruhh
OMG EPIC FIGHT BATTLE!
Whattt this is unreal brohh
NO FUCKIN WAY LETS GOOO
perdon?
Sir ji hindi dub do it
Cant wait
Gana baki, tampoco hay que pensarla tanto.
I think it would be better to have a fusion between anime  You agree with me ?
kengan ashura will have actual animation???  poggers.
Bruh I gotta be dreaming WTFF IS HAPPENING OMGGGG😍😍😍😍😍
☠️ Idk what I write
Who will win a fight between Yujiro and Shen?
This is fucking stupid
Baki slams neg dif
ABOUT FUCKING TIME 😭
Dear god
baki vs ohma If they fight these two, ohma will definitely win. Because kengan omega has more power than ohma before and ohma has terrible demon power😊😊
Netflix don´t touch !!
I'm so happy it's in the baki art style this is gonna be so one-sided tho 😭Whats kengan verse supposed to do against yujiro this isnt omega there isnt any shen, its over fr
I just gooned
this the collab i was not expecting but im all here for it
Wat
But why?
holy. Baki coming back already?! Ohma too. Netflix Anime is cooking the bacon
Both of these characters deserve to be in Tekken 8.
Does anyone want to correct the trailer. He is now the strongest creature on earth not the strongest kid in high school.
PEAKKK
Baki wins
They should've adapted Kengan Ashura animation style
I am dying, give  KA season 3
Team Baki 👇🏻drop a like
cross over or not baki would def one shot i’m team baki all the way
O M G !!!! damn
Ayooo
😯😯💥💥💥
❤
한마 유지로가 모든 것을 정리 할 것이다.
dioooooos se hizo canon
I am waiting for you baki hanama kengan  Ashura ❤
Bro wtf is this animate musashi its better
I’m far more hyped for this fight then any irl ones 😂
Baki  is so powerful
What!?
Wowaaa😂❤
Finish kengan Ashura first!!
Baki is definitely winning like KA NOT even in its 3rd season
Still waiting for the dmc series
People who watch baking on Netflix 🤯 People who watched kengan afterwards 🤯  And people who said, wouldn't it be cool if those two fought, sure like that'll ever happen :🤯🤯
wait baki wins hands down right?
No way...
Yujiro is ga yay. Baki’s mom been trying to get him to do with her. Yet he keeps rejecting her. But then he went to violation Joe. If that isn’t g yay I don’t know what is.  Look a hot lady is trying to get him to do with her. But he rejects her. But then he violation Joe William. There’s no other option. There’s no other way to reword this people, accept the truth. Yujiro is gar yay.
Netflix is gay
😮
Who wants kengan Ashura series in official Hindi dubbed to like that comment 🎉
🔥HELL YEAH🔥
Now gives them stans too ✨😁✨
우 일석 맞죠?
I want to see Yujiro vs Ohma or Kuroki.
Ok cool, but we need kengan ashura/omega already
Just don't nerf baki, cause bro it's not even close.
JUNE 6 IS MY BDAY😮 FINALLY A EVENT SO SOMEBODY WOULD CARE FOR MY BDAY

❤
Agora so falta a netflix anunciar daqui a 1 ano a adaptação de Star: Strike It Rich
Great but we all know Baki is stronger tho
This fight will be very balanced, one moment Baki hits and the next Ohma is beaten.
Baki getting this Dub
goofy
what is this baki can defeat ohma in 2 punches
This gotta be jokes bc Baki wins easy
Nice nice nice nice
I got Baki in 4.
Espero que tenga reggaeton el opening xD
Reality isn't real.
berserk
Omg
i've always wanted to see if he could beat baki, ig my dream has come true
ADD TOWORROW´S JOE
thanks netflix
At the end of the fight they will say the winner is YOU the viewer at home …smh
Total devastation in June
sometimes dreams come true, boys.
Team Baki 1000%🔥
HOLD UP LET THEM COOK 🔥🔥
Soy team kengan
This like Kong x Godzilla
Epico
they just going to say it's a draw.
I wanna watch this at the cinema
Its dope but we all know those hanmas are the ultimates....and i enjoy Both stories.
I’m waiting for new episodes to drop already for Kengan. 😮‍💨
I'm more hyped for the side fights. My god who will dare cross Yujiro. EXCITED!
Team ohma
Elden ring dlc andxthe best 1v1 ever??? I can not ask for more
NO WAY!
I had to double check the channel to make sure this wasn't a troll lol
Im dreaming... I MUST BE DREAMING
its gonna be some stupid tie or they fight someone stronger
WE BECOMING THE STRONGEST CREATURES ON EARTH WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Ohma renacido no creo que salga y baki con su espalda menos
IS THIS REAL?
Next Goku vs Saitama
Is this real ? 🤔
Baki just claps because hanma blood & demon brain can simply summon 100 ghosts of himself to whoop bros ass
I'm dream?
Why are you showing trailers for this anime when you haven't even finish? Asura😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
NAAAAAAAAAAAAA EEEEPICO
I'm so fucking hyped
Hk
dddddaaaammmm 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This would be awesome, eagerly awaiting 😍😍😍
We havent even seen the end of Kengan Ashura yet...
So psyched!!!
And the winner is Yujiro
Plis pin my comment
What a time to be alive...
ippo vs baki, cade netfliix????
Oh my gooooooood 😮
Previous season me bohot jyada narrator talking thi and story me bhi narrator talk + masala kuch kuch jaga cum pad raha tha
Se acerca el crossover 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Ohma looks odd but besides that I'm hyped for it
No way
YOOOOOOOWWWWW.... Never thought Netflix would listen to our voice :D
as much as I love baki, I really hope they don't do it in the baki style of fighting, I enjoy kengan ashura more because the fight scenes flow better and look more realistic whereas baki throws one punch and then goes off on a monologue about it.  Not to say I want it in 3D, I just want to watch the fight play out, not 7,000 backstories.
Who y'all got baki or ohma oooo I can't wait
its good that its not kengan ashura art style I was kinda worried ngl
Ngl I wanted baki vs kenichi😂😂
I want BAKI to win
This is gonna be a execution
Shiiiittt.  This is happening
WTF!!!!!
Who ever the Netflix employee is who is responsible for this needs to be rewarded with a 2× salary increase and 75 virgin brides 😂
No wayyyy😮😮😮😮
Holy shi lmao this is gonna be fire
Ohma getting cooked 😭
Wait, that means the "sido chesto" is from the same universe?
with all due respect , give ohma a machine gun
C'est donc ca le multivers
So is it actually going to be animated or the terrible CGI crap?  Trailer, or lack thereof, looked great for that whole second
I hope they choose the anime style of Baki .. that's it ..❤
Uh.. what? For real? I thought this was one of those concept trailers by Youtubers until I saw it was from the actual netflix channel. Never seen Baki Hanma, but I want a continuation of Kengan Ashura. At least till the end of the first manga.
GTFOH WHAT?!?! naaaaaaah props! 👏
Baki wins just because kengan ashura obviously copied Baki lol
So I know this would mean a rewrite but Baki one hundred percent should show up in Record of Ragnarok.
I swear Baki will win although tokita is cool and a monster
Yoooo WTF!!!! 💪💪💪
Yujiro still isn't impressed with these children
we need oliva vs julius reinhold
wtf wait what ? so we dont got do pvp edits?  damn nice
그림체가 바키인거보니 저기선 바키가이기겟네..
Is this really coming out? How are both in single frame?
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
BAKI giving smoke
WHAAAAAAAAT?!
COOL
HOLY SHIT FUCK YEAH
Hayda
BANZAI
No fucking way holy fucking shit
This is the best bday surprise
Nobody asked for this, but... well, to hell with it.
It's a bull shit this one
지렸다
Omg 😱 ❤❤❤❤
Офигеть че намечается
No mames, no mames
No fkn way
王馬勝てないでしょ
What the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
REAL?
Nah that's 🧢🧢🧢🧢
I like kengen asura more
Is taking place after the father son fight?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
So no Musashi Miyamoto? Okay, fuck you.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!!
Baki is for kids. Kengan is for men.
Baki
Quizás, este crossover es una demostración de como serían los animes, si fusionan la animación y diseños de baki, con la animación de las peleas de kengan ashura, así se vería épico, aunque no me gustó como se veía ohma con la animación de baki.
Alright but who do You have your money on?????
Baki is on another level
I ain't gonna lie I'm going to watch it I've been waiting for this to happen I heard rumors about it but I never thought it was going to actually happen I'm so excited I'm so giddy😊😊😊😊😊😊
How they gonna fight when the death tournament isn't even finished but I am hyped for this tho
Might as well make goku the referee
this its fake???
? 둘이 만나는거야? 좋은데 둘이 싸운는 모습 궁금했는데😮😮
bro ohmas done for ;-;
next goku vs satima💀
OMG!!! Lo que se viene!!! 🤯🤯🤯
The colab that we thougt that would never going to happen
Baki is for children. Childish animation. Kengan Ashura is the right animation style, but you wasted it with this.
Ohma wins here ⬇️
🙆🏿‍♂️ oh my god....please let thus be true!!! I must stay alive until June 🤷🏿‍♂️i can do it....yes I'm old!!!
bro whatt 😭
I feel like Baki would straight dogwalk Kengan
On par with Tyson v Jake
I don't want to shit talk it because this is a cool idea but that face
fuck yeah!!
I’m so tired of seeing his Japanese animation Shows catering towards white people. Mostly you don’t see them creating characters that look like themselves, but mostly look like white people and I’m so tired of animation.
no fucking way
Пажалусто сравните джека против райана
Oh absolutely yes
I’M DREAMING RIGHT NOW 😮😮😮😮
no...way a
lets not pretend like we dont know who is going to win...
🫶
okay awesome, but when the fuck is the kengan ashura season coming out? it's been 3 years telling us ''it's coming out in october'' and never does.
oh my...
Like: Baki gonna take the W                            Comment: Kengan gonna take the W 👇                                                                    👇
cant wait for this tho
An even more intense bout would be..."Hayato Fūrinji vs. Yujiro Hanma".
I love Kengan but Baki too crazy for Kengan bruh 😂
netflix ACTUALLY did something we wanted for once.   you did good, thank you netflix.
NAAAAAAAA THIS IS TOOOOO GOOOODDDDDD NAAAAA THIS IS AMAZINGGGG
baki gon get nerfed BADLY💀
Woah Kengan being animated correctly? Huge shocker
Seriously?
Is this a joke?
Ngl baki doesn't compare to kengan at all the world of kengan is consistent and actually good baki is a pile of shit full of plot armor
Baki, I'm saying it now
I’ll be pissed if it’s in that crappy 3d animation
Hoooooooooooloooollyyyt shit yes!!!!!
YOOOO!!!
Baki wins.
Ya me imagino a baki sacando su esquizofrenia del bolsillo XD
June? We got this fight booked for June before we got Conor Mcgregor Vs Michael Chandler
we're so back
OMG YES THANK YOU ITS SO COOL I LOVE IT
OH MY GOSH
The fights would've been better in 3d like how keegan ashura did it imo
Honestly netflix been slapping recently
The manga portion was literally only 2-3 chapters, watch nextflix make it one episode an scrp it...
MAke kengan this animaton for fuck sake...enough with cgi
If u look through baki is far more stronger than ohma  no denied
Is this real chat?
Si los graficos son como el anime de Baki Hanma excelente, de lo contrario en el anime de Ashura falta calidad grafica.
I thought it was a meme😅
Опачки,ждете ?
No freaking way, this is gold 😮
AHHHHHHHHH ES CAnon carajo!!! WOOOOOOOOWWW
..... faints ....  taps replay ..... faints again
Baki winning ❤
Literally baki wins 💪
The only thing missing is the cast of Cobra Kai watching in the arena.
Keep going Toxic, you consistent asl
Baki wins
What this is so crazy Netflix this is so dope!!
Imagine they both end up fighting Yujiro to the death for real like an actual fight with Yujiro going for the kill
YOOO DUDE RLLY?????
someone getting nerfed or someone getting buffed
I'm sorry huh?????? Netflix cooking something up??
where is komi can't communicate
Uaooo
i seen this on tiktok and thought it was fakes asf but nah now im excited
This is madness. This is the equivalent of a prime Muhammad Ali vs prime Mike Tyson, an otherworldly fight but impossible. And now's happening. I can't do anything but thank whoever is in charge of the anime department on Netflix because this will be EPIC🔥🔥
Netflix realizando sonhos! EU TO GRITANDO❤
bro is cooking🗣️🗣️🗣️
Bro that is literally my birthday
Not sure what’s going on in this trailer.  But, not knowing Netflix they’ll either turn it super gay, or something utterly stupid in the guise of “brave and stunning”.
Baki ftw easy.
Esto es real  Cuestión thi is real.
"Why do you watch this, the story is dumb and the characters are shallow." Me, growing up with DBZ, Saint Seiya, and YuYu Hakusho.  "Sometimes you just wanna watch two people fight under the most outrageous circumstances conceiveable."
NO IMPOSSIBLE!
It would be REALLY cool. Netflix could create a series based on the struggles of characters from different franchises, that would be a dream
O.O
1 hour film or a 30 minutes special episode?
oh THIS IS PEAK AUGGHHHH
Baki is gonna slap Omaha like a child lol.
What a strange time we live in
3D ??????
Season 3 baki skip this one CGI and the other 2d CGI anime is wack
Epic 🔥
Place your bets everyone place your bets
Funny how "rivaling" martial arts media go in similar directions, where one is overblown, batsh&t crazy stuff vs more grounded and understandable stuff.  In this case we have: Strongmen part-timing as martial artist, playing with above insane anime-logic vs Martial Artist, fighting with impressive portrayals of diverse martial arts, sprinkled with your average dosis of anime-logic. 😂🥋🥊  Then in the videogame scene, we got: Bodybuilding magicians with martial arts skills (Street Fighter) vs Martial Artist with supernatural powers (Tekken). 🎮🕹️  *But here's where things get INTERESTING:* - The _Kengan Ashura_ manga has a crossover with _Street Fighter._ - _Street x Tekken_ is a existing crossover released 12 years ago. - _Tekken_ & _Baki_ fans has been asking for Baki and/or Yujiro to join the Tekken roaster. - Netflix's _"Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura"_ would be the third official crossover between these 4 series.  ...Which means, a _Street Fighter vs Tekken vs Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura_ crossover is a reasonable project. 🔥🙏🔥
YES!
🧐 logic and reasoning prevails again. ...what if one punch man and my hero academia... they should make some yujiro fitness videos 😂
Whoever pitched this idea was a gigachad
Glad they did it in the Baki style
This is fucking insane who have ever thought this like the anime version of a real paper view title fight
if i'm in a dream abt this video don't wake me up
Only watched Baki, Not sure who Kengan is, but I will do my research on him before this comes out. He must be formidable if he’s facing Baki!
COLD
Baki rahat alır
next i want to see the hanma yujiro in record of ragnarok
Yoooooo
I watched all of what Netflix has to offer from both series. I'm pretty sure baki would win this.
I'm more stoked for this than I am the presidential election.
AIN'T NO FUCKING WAY
Where is the Steel Ball Run Trailer?
Baki Way Stronger
best birthday gift ever !!!!!!!!!
I am a fan and I want service.
is this real ?or just a 1st of april joke ?
Let's go Ohma Tokita!!!
I will die in fitness.
its not gonna be fair. baki universe are simple too fast for the kengan people
Yeeeeesssiir
What
BRUH LETS FUCKING GO
Depending on what age Baki he should easily win it's not even close
Auint no way this is real 😭😭
Finally its happening tht all world was waiting for.
More ppl will watch this over Jake vs Mike
baki wins
19 frames...
HOLY SHIT, NETFLIX ACTUALLY HAVING A W MOMENT
🔥🔥
what
Bro I've been waiting for this
cant wait for them to team up against a common enemy.
This will be fire
I like kengan more manga but honesty baki wins all the time oh that neat you can make your heart go real fast well im gonna pretend im a triceratops and somehow it just works
Kengan Ashura is 100 times better than baki
I feel like kengen ashura isn't strong enough for baki now but i hope they make it a super fun figjt like the father son fight
looooooooooool im i dreaming
This is fake right? Tell me it's fake.
Now if only we can get Baki and Yujiro in Tekken.
The best birthday present an anime fan could ask for. Thanks for dropping this on my Bday Netflix! I cant wait!
baki win ez xd
Referee would be yujiro 😂😂😂😂
Canon😊
Hype
Poor tokita ohma.😅
Something tells me this battle will end in a stalemate and a thumbs up 🤔🤔🤔
NO FUCKING WAY!!!!  OHHHH SHIT LETS GOOOOOO
Joder macho tu marido Baki
i wanna see doppo vs kuroki to
Que Riko.
This is the first time I've seen an anime crossover.
what the fuck
Damn the vs battle community had been doing it to long now they doing it themselves on Netflix thats wild🗿💀
No way, this will be truly legendary. Olamaz bu gerçekten efsane olucak
Am i dreaming?
por mais legal que seria nao é como se o ohma tokita tivesse chances contra o baki kkk sla vao ter que buffar o ohma pra isso mas vai ser legal mais um pra lista do baki
No way😮
Yooo what the fuck
No freaking way?? Please tell me this is real?? I always dream of that crossover in my sleep.
I'm surprised 😯
Yo I think I peed my pants
Baki finished at its peak, Ohma won't stand a change. They should work on Kengen first.
Way no way way no way way no way
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
I want to make this crossover my wife
Chopper can solo the verse 😭😭😭
Baki all day
I just feel like this aint even fair, if youve read baki and kengan baki easily wins this like you aint stopping baki yujiro and pickle ur judt notthen throw in no me no sukuna and bow jsck with hus own book kengan jusyt looks like really really shitty super hearos stumbling into a fight with vegta and goku in plain clothes
We already know what gonna happen Baki is going to break him down and when he thinks that power up when he speeds up his blood flow baki is going to go full hanma and do yujiro proud
Let's be real here Baki wins hands down
straight hands equal stats no powers whos winning?
The Hanma vs Tokita. Wow!
Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude………………………………………………😮
lets toss a coin to see who will win (creators)
Im a fan of Kengan but damn Baki would win vs ohma tho
this... this can't be
Ohma and Baki have an epic staredown.  A wild Yujiro appears.
Team Baki leave a like!!
Am I tripping rn or this is real?
And it is 2D guys, nice, so i can watch it properly, not like Kengan Ashura, that is made with that cringy low fps laggy style.
😳😳🥶🥶🥶
I would still like to see youjiro  Hama versus the elder from kenichi the mightiest disciple
Ill say this again if they use kegan fight style and animation its going to be good if they use baki its going to be ass
What the fuck.. Is that real? Or is it a dream?  I dont fuckn care, i'm hyped!
YOOOOOOO!!!
Pray for Ohma because it’s not looking good for him 😭🙏
God did!!!!
Holy shite😮can't wait😍😍😍😍😍
You're kidding me.......
This is the real life? This is just fantasy????
Baki wins no diff
Holy shit durable and smart fighter vs smart fighter and durable 😅
Shit.. i got a feeling the fights gonna secrete so much testosterone that I'll experience hormonal imbalance.
My moneys on Baki
Gentlemen, testosterone is increasing to max levels
This is definitely a simulation
Come on , come on man ❤
Неужели нетфлиск начало делать годные темы ну наконец что-то интересное 🎉
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I WANT THIS CAME TRUEEEE
i haven't seen both kengen ashura and baki hanama  but i will watch this
Is this fr like am I sleep right now
There's no way, Baki could win Ohma. Sorry.
nani ?
i dont think this is supposed to happen i believe it fucks up the baki and kengan universe
I love both but let’s be real here, Baki wins here
I'm just say... WOOOOOW!!!
Is this fake?
What is this, a crossover episode? 🥁
I just hope they animate it with the same intensity that Kengan fights diliver on.
🎉🎉🎉🎉  Yeah bwoy let's go
How is this a fair match up?   Baki Hanma can immobilize u in a tenth of a second.  Tokita can't even win against Biscuit Olivia
WTF !!!
Baki neggs the verse and yes I watch ohma tokita lol if u smart u know yujiro with no problem
We're in the end game now
Tokita winner
Baki With his devil's back ohma with his release technique
Easy for baki
wow wow wow wait whatdehelelll 💀
Eyyoo are we dreaming?
Bro!!🤲🏼
Goosebumps
Do a flip
Trash vs 3D trash
Baki is gonna kill dude
I bet it just ends in a tie because "we can't have any one of them loose"
Baki wins no diff
Everyone knows Baki will win.
The universe levels are too different. Baki easy win
Welcome to Anime DEATH BATTLE
They are both powerhouses, so I'll say it come to a tie.
OH SHII 🔥🔥 IT’S A DREAM, SOMEONE PINCH ME
Whatttttttt! 🤯
第三季要来了吗
I mean my birthday Is Not on 6 june but holy shit thanks
How long have we been waiting for this moment? It’s finally here. That is the best I can put it even though it’s nowhere CLOSE to the hype that’s been building up, especially now we see a definitive proof of it coming
We need more crossover style shows like this, just like the comics did, copyright really sucks
Ohma will pulverized him for sure 😂  Baki fans right now 🤬
At first I read this as Baki Hanma VS Senran Kagura. Since it was Netflix, I didn't think twice.
🥹
Nice ideia for a movie.
GOOSEBUMPS!!!👏🙌
There's no way..
Holy shit is this real chat or are we dreaming
I don't see how Ohma beats baki.
Isn't Baki power level a bit too high for KA at the moment... There is a guy who bit a grenade and a grandpa who cannot take damage.
Bro they HAVE to nerf Baki .
🤑
But why Kengen isn't looking like Kengen?
WTH iw9wk2i3jsmjsowowlamamwiq92ojwjajaoqoaoqkw9wow9k2kwk🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Wait a minute
Looks like a draw is on the horizon...only way both fan base won't riot
IMAGINE, imagine how bad and unrealistic and terrible the plot and fighting will be!  all of Kengan is trash, Baki after the grappler series is feces, both writen by chubby soy boys with furrys in their family 😂😂😂
Bro this is insane🤯🤩
y'all not ready for Hanma Yujiro vs Uvogin from HxH
"Animated 2D Ohma doesn't exist, he won't hurt you"  Animated 2D Ohma:
Ohma win extreme diff
Watch it end n a drawl when honestly i feel Baki would have an easy victory.  Im ready for the Jack Hanma arc.
but please put time in that animation...🙏🏻🙏🏻
HOOOOOLY
Animation bout to be better than the awful one of baki and ashura
Baki Easy win
Is this for real dude?
epic pissing battle lets gooo
They finna throw straight *HAYMAKERS* at each other.
Para mí es una 💩...ambos son universos muy diferentes! Van a terminar nerfeando a uno de los dos!
I'm not ready for this.
Why😂
Tf 💀
Погодите, это реально?
Fake😂
this is paradise
CMON OHMA SAN KICK HIS AAAAAAAAA
Whaaaaaaaat i want it get my kredit card
We want Saitamas next season
Man, poor Oma.
😍😍
On that day it is my birthday 6th of June
How about more Kengan Ashura seasons?
Ain't no way bro.😮
Damn 😮😮
I’m gonna shit
tunometecabrasaramambiche
Oh maaaan I can hear the power scaling boys getting worked up over this one
thankyou 🙏
Wait...SERIOUSLY?!?
If they add jack vs rain that be crazy
No fucking wayyy
If baki lose am done!!
WE WANT A WINNER . NOT A TEAM MATCH .
Boo we want yujiro
baki solo vs kengan verse
how about next season of kengan ashura so we can move on to kengan omega
We need more kengan ashura pls.
can the winner fight against Chinmi?
Is this a crossover? What's Baki crossing over with?
Finally this is my chance to watch this crossover
I’m going Baki
Waiting for it? I havent even started the 2nd season of baki, not including the original baki anime series and havent even watch Kengan....ill probably see this in 2025
I love Kengan way more than Bali but I know it’s definitely not a fair fight
Is this a sh*tpost? HAHAH
baki hanma 2D and kengan ashura 3D 😑 why?
About Time.......😊
Holy cow
😯😯😯
U can't wait for this 🥶😍 please realize it fast 🙏
I have been waiting for this
Looks like they're going with the 2D baki style over kengans 3D. Probably a good move. Can't imagine it'd be easy to make a convincing 3D baki
this is fucking hype
I can’t wait to see neither of them lose
I bet they're gonna marry in the end.
Tunotemecabrassarambiches regresan
Oha
OK NETFLIX I SEE YOU
Literally got goosebumps from those 20 seconds
This shit about to be heat
No way its real?
This is not real 😂😂😂❤
I’ve been waiting for this since I started watching both of their shows
Finally...a worthy matchup.... their battle will be LEGENDARY!!!!!
最初野獣の咆哮にしか聞こえん
Between this and the elden ring dlc we're eating good in June!
WTF NEFLIX IS COOKING , THEY MIGHT BURN THE KITCHEN WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Didyowashyourasstoday
Wait what? I was not expecting this at all but im excited for it!
OH OH OH MY FINALLY!! N
omg really? :o but if they are located in Baki's imiverse we already know who the win is for
Is this real?
D....did I die??? Someone tell me I didn't pass away my sleep or some shit This is real?!?!?!  Oh fuck the hell yes!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Team Baki😈💪
Netflix is doing great
This about to be litty
Brrrooooooo
2 years ago: "damn bro I wish baki and tokita would fight, I wonder who's the strongest" IS THIS REAL
will this be a movie? and is this the arc after son of ogre?
Ngl Baki should win this
netflix is good for this
Coughing baby vs Atomic bomb
LETS GOOOOOO
AAND  ITS NOT GONNA BE SOME 3D BULLSHIT....not saying kengan was a bad anime but THIS is much better
We still need to learn more about ohma’s true potential, he is just getting started 😂 while baki’s stories/shows has been around for years 😅
Bro I genuinely sont see how this is gonna go they’re both main characters it’s hard for them to make one of them lose
Whaat!?
Baki destroys
Kengan is OVERRATED
Ganamos!!
knowing Baki Hanma, some bs is about to happen for him to beat Kengan
A what and the what now?
baki have to win
Going to be even more ridiculous since they're baki world
YESSS!!!
Bro but the power difference is huge i dont get it
if this is a dream dont wake me up
Looks like I gotta catch up.
After Ohma remembered his training I think he might actually stand a chance.
Baki would win, the series is less realistic than Kengan, which is part of it's charm. But I'm pretty sure Ohma never punched through steel walls, or used his imagination to made a stand of a Dinosaur or Yujiro that was so "realistic" that other people could see it and have it nearly kill him. The idea is going to be interested because I love both series, but this'd be like pitting Goku vs Naruto before he became Hokage.
Is this for real?
Looks like I'm getting a Netflix subscription for 1 month only.
No freaking way..
van a meterle nerf a baki :(
Baki wins this by a land slide but knowing how these things go, they prob wont settle a battle between the two.
The movie every man need to watch to became a man
They used the Baki artstyle instead of Kengan: Everyone Liked That
OHMA GOT IT NIGGA NO CAP
CGI vs Ani/CGI.
Thank god it’s bakis animation
This bout is gonna go so hard, I might go insane
This fight is gonna go so crazy and hard, I might go insane
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I SWEAR TO GOD.
Baki ftw
OHHHHOHOHOHOHHOOHOH..!!!!
YOU JOKINGHGGGGGG WSTFFF
Let's f@ckin go!
por favor netflix no lo arruines.
Yujiro is about to embarrass both fighters the moment they start 💀
Wow finally Kengan Ashura with good animation and not that 3d ani garbage.
Watch them team up and fight a greater force
I ain't going to lie baki might have it in the bag
FUDEU
To me; the REAL Hero in Kengan Ashura; is the office worker - Kazuo Yamashita - who gets wrapped up in the whole thing  We see him go from every man, To every bad ass man, in the show's intro creds
"Synchronicity; Baki!"  "I liked the other boat more"
this is a great day for annoying people
Let’s gooooooo
i want baki vs the fang
So is  it going to be in 3D or anime style 😅
NO WAY, THIS IS GONNA BE HYPE!!! The two best fighting anime’s with cgi going at it with a crossover is insane!!!
Baki is waay stronger than ohma even ohma currently
Regardless of the result, this is gonna be so god damn cool       That being said Baki absolutely takes this.
this gotta be netflix's first W
Estoy llorando de la emocion!! OMG!!!
oooooooooh me vengooooooooooooooooooooo
sinceramente, baki amassa o oma, porem vamos ver oq vai ser
“watch Baki it’s peak”
❤❤❤
Tbh it only look so but the outcome baki wins 😂
jimmy neutron and timmy turner type shi
we dont need this just contenue the original animes  thanks
I secretly wanted this for years! Never even thought it could be done.
O que 😮
Nossa hora chegou rapaziada kkkkkk
Use Kengans art style
😮😮😮
❤❤❤❤
AMEN GOD BLESS US EVERYONE 🙏 & MARTIAL ARTS TOO
esto va ser epico papus
HOLY FUCK
Is this fr guys? Wtf
Ngl I’ve been waiting for this for too long it’s about time
I'm too much of a Kengan Ashura fan that I just want the next season of KA. Baki the Grappler was pretty good back when it was first introduced, but I'm not too crazy about it now. Still though, I think this is a nice collab.
JUNE NEEDS TO HURRY THE FUCK UP I'm too excited for This
Hahaha aint no way!
Bettt
Can we get more anime crossovers. That actually make sense too
EXCUSE ME WHATTT?!?!?!!?!?!!!!?!?!
I'm so dang hype for this. The rivalry between these shows man...
Is it for real, that would be dope
Damn bruh june 6 and then theres bad boys on june 7 life is good
Baki negs
Cgi is better for this genre, detailed fights in Kengan series makes it watchable.
Rip to all who were not here to witness this.
EXCUSE ME?! 😱
June 6 is my damn birthday. This gonna be awesome.
Kengen ashura deserves more love and I’m mad hyped to see this
Baki wins obviously
I swear this is isn't a real timeline 😮
hahaha para quem acompanha os dois vai ser a melhor coisa que vao fazer fundir  para um grande duelo do pvp lutas boas que da hora
Wait..What 🤯
As long as Yujiro Hanma also gets to meet Kuroki Gensai and Shen Wulong, I'll be happy.
Weebs who think ohma gonna win are more bazed than moai🗿😏
chat this is a w
Oh I can't wait
What the fuck that’s gonna be crazy as hell they both don’t give up both give it they all even if it means they die can we please get a JJk vs Naruto please it’s the battle every anime lover been waiting for thank you in advance 🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽
what lol
Baki wins
tokita didn't have a chance...
Funny if its really no winner,and just one good fight.
Bro’s crossing universe to fight now 💀
🎇
I feel like I just gained more testosterone just by watching this
😲
Bets that Yujiro shows up and beats them both?
Kengan 👍
this is too good. but we know whos gonna win.
What in the Death Battle is this!!
Ain't no way we got ohma vs baki before Gta 6
Nem fudendo!!
NO WAY! AM I DREAMING?
what?
no way this is happening
Name ost
NAH NAH LMAO THIS IS CRAZY DOPE! ...But, didnt my boy Ohma die in the ending of Kengan Ashura?😢
this is actually insane
Lame because Baki is stronger
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Can we finish kengan ashura first 🤷🏾‍♂️
Demon back gonna clutch this
This real!!!!
They probably shouldn't have done this. No matter who wins, there will be people upset on both sides. And truth be told, there is no way Baki would lose.
Kengan deserves a lot more attention i swear it's so good, people don't watch it only because of the artstyle which is good anyway with smooth af animation
oye netflix pa cuando lookism temporada 2 no seas terco
y el ganador va a un especial crossover de shumatsu no valkyrie!
wow for real? LUL
Seeing kengen in 2d really reminds me of what they took from us
The internet approves.
Nooooo waaaay this is cool
This will be light work for Baki
Probably end up as a tie but Baki is definitely winning
Omaiga esto va ser epico papus
Baki win
i didnt want to watch that kengen thing but now i need to. fok me
can we just get another season of baki that's good
June 6: Baki vs Kengan, European elections, D-Day, and my birthday. Let's go!
AIN"T NO WAY! AIN"T NO WAY!!! SOMEONE TELL ME THIS ISN"T A APRIL FOOLS JOKE!! 😭
if this was made my baki creator, there would just be about who trained more and fuck style or technique.
Team Baki where you at? 💪
Give the fans what they want. It doesn't need to be canon. Just give us a fun cross over.
NAAAAHHHHH I cant belive it !
Huh I guess this ends the discussion of Baki and Kengan Ashura characters being significantly stronger or weaker than each other. They seem to be all around the same level.
It’s been a while since I seen a crossover, this is gonna be awesome!
CGI vs 2D
I hope the animated is baki style but in kengan ring..
Yoooooooooooooo wtf WTF Yoooooooooo
Now the things is who has the plot armor
This might be so bad it’s boring. But I will still watch it for years to tell stories to the future generations
Idc about GTA 6 anymore, THIS IS IT. JUNE 6 PLEASE COME FASTER.
Baki is washing him
How about finishing ashura first huh?
This fuckings sucks leave baki alonr your adaptation sucks already enough on its own
So... WHO YA'LL GOT? I'm HANMA
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESS
Shen Wulong and Yujiro Hanma looking in horror as Machio rips open the space time continuum via performing a pec fly.
THATS INSANE YO
Lesssss goooooooo
Perfect
Wait is this real???
I’m so happy they did it in the Baki art style
Everyone know baki is going to win
Holy smokes!
Think yujior would be intrested in fighting the people in the kengan ashura tourment.
Gensai vs Yujiro🔥🔥🔥
Baki is on another level... doesnt make sense
HAPPY APRIL FOOLS
I'm gonna edge to this
Baki claps
Netflix todos tus pecados han sido perdonados. / Netflix all your sins have been forgiven
Can they finish kegan ashura cgi show first. Watched the show before the reading some of the manga and i would love to see it through watching it
wait wtf?
baki vs fake baki
...WHAT DA FU-
Omg im so excited!!😆 i really hope it's good
I didn't want this to happen in Baki's animation please go with kengan
mike tyson vs jake paul and now baki vs ohma this is very exciting
👀👀
OMG 🤯!! This is going to be epic!! Thank you netflix for this❤❤
Awesome Baki bout get beat tf up
Holy moly! Is this real? Whoever decided to do so must be awarded! Both are legendary!
Hype af, but you already know it's going to be a draw. No way they're going to disrespect one character or the other like that.
Question is Baki gonna be downplayed to match the feats of kengan or kengan ashura universe is gonna be boosted to match the feats in Baki. If anyone knows the PTJ universe you know what I’m talking about, in lookism people can easily bend steel bars and cut metal with bare hands, but in viral hit they can maybe dent a car hood.
Aint no way this is happening 😮
楽しみだ
Ohma rules.👊👊👊
Bro kengan verse doesnt stand a chance against bakis infinite blood supply 😂
What we need is the Musahi Miyamoto arc
Bullshit I'll believe it when I see it.
Ohma gets washed
No way!! Can't believe they doing this.  This gona be epic
Real??
Yo can we get a saitama vs goku battle next?
Death Battle taking to long to do your favorite match-up  Animators: "Find I'll do it myself"
Baki gang<<<<<<<Ashura gang
Expectation: Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura Reality: Baki Hanma and Kengan Ashura is gonna be fighting Dio Brando who got isekai'd into Hanma and Ashura's world by Jotaro Kujo.
I just hate this so much. Power scaling in Baki is just too much for Kengan Ashura.  Then in the show they'll make it a draw. Huge nerf for Baki.
Rip ohma
Baki wins. End of story.
no contrato vai dar empate na realidade todo mundo sabe que o baki sola  ele facil ... eu quero ver mesmo é Yujiro hama vs Piklee kkkkk
QUEEEEEEEEEE?
Holyyy f I couldn't even imagine it happening Let's goooo
The legendary crossover we’ve all been waiting for 🤩🤩
baki would destroy ohma tho.  he’s in a totally different league.
Now I can finally see Yujiro vs Gensai
Fuck gta 6. This is WAY more important
I'm so confused right now, i remember "kengun x baki" manga used kengun art style right? ,but now when it became anime why they changed to baki style.
Omagaaaaaa 😮
No fucking way!!!!
Nah this ain't it.  There are hundreds upon hundreds of chapters of content from Baki and Kengan that they could be making instead.
Will be a draw or baki win. Thats sure
I mean they do take place in the same universe, since it has been shown that Orochi Doppo had once faced Gaolangs father.
Bro this is so majestic, im edging rn.🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥‼️‼️🔥🔥💪💪
After june sixth and 7 days later im 13
Wow, this is exactly what I wanted. Thanks Netflix.
This is crazzzzyyyyyyy af 😵😵😵😵😵😵
Finally, after these years
Is that real?
i hope it's good :>
Ayo this rat poison hit different
LET GOOOOO!!!!
Ohma dies in the main manga btw
lol
🔥🔥
NO. FREAKING. WAY.
LETS GOOOOO BAKI X KENGANNN FUCKCKCKK
🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Hopefully this paves a way for more "Anime vs Anime" types of series
Guys the matrix just glitched and gave us the best cross-over episode
who do you guys have winning?
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.. This gave me Goosebumps, i cant believe this is happening, i would like to see Baki fighting the FANG ... Huhuhahahahaha
It seem that I will have to renew my Netflix subscription 😮
Ohma would be a fuckin beast dude. He would just sacrifice himself to win. With the invisible food logic, he is the strongest
Who are know inspiration to write anime BAKI ?
This has to be the most meatheaded, raw, testosterone filled, badass collab in anime ever. I'm so fucking hyped!
Wait so does this mean that Baki is now canon to the Sandroverse?
Now all I need is Fist of the North Star vs Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and my life will be complete
Holy! I mean amazing! I gotta say this is way over what i was thinking!
I thought this wasn't real...Its real? holy shit, Gonna invite the boys and get some beer.
OQUEEEEEEEEEEEE?????
Dude ever since I seen both I was always imagining a crossover this is actually fucking insane
Baki win
와 이건 봐야해
Never saw people so hyped for a fight who they know who is going to win.  Well maybe with Kong vs Godzilla
No fucking way🎉💪💪😤
The foolishness is ridiculous with these shows.
Is this for real? 😮
O MAIIIII GAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Sung Jin Woo vs Cid Kagenou  Naruto vs Deku  Gon vs Yusuke
바키가 이기지
Routing for asura. Baki was but slow and boring
should've 100% been in the Kenyan shura animation style ohm looks horrible lol.
It’s gonna be some tie bullshit
Why
What? Is this real? Dont tell me there gonna be a 3rd party 💀💀
Great news, I only recently imagined such a fight and now it will become real! But the main thing is not to have too high expectations
Yes!
Hell nah, time to get ripped before June 6th
WTF 🤬
Ohma might be severely nerfed. Baki is stronger but the niko style can still defeat him with the full martial arts techniques. It’ll probably only be season 2 Ohma so he’ll barely have any of his moves to use whilst Baki has the whole son of ogre skill tree to choose from. Hopefully it’s Baki after he defeats Muhammad Ali Jr (that plot is still so stupid).
Ngl, never watched the other dudes anime but…I’m pretty sure Baki’s got this
They really want me to watch kengan don’t they
wtf 💀💀💀
Chat... is this real?
I wonder... would this Tokita Ohma be the Kengan Ashura version, or the Kengan Omega version? I would think that Omega's Ohma would be a more fair fight against Baki. Thoughts?
WE WANT TO SEE  YUJIRO AND BAKI  IN KENGAN VERSION ART STYLE.. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
NETFLIX KNOWS WHAT WE WANT I DONT EVEN KNOW IF THIS IS A DREAM OR NOT
This has to be a bug in the sistem
as much as I love kengan ashura , baki taking the dub
And i thought Homer Simpson vs Peter Griffin was the best fight ever. This will change in June 2024!!!! 🎉
Team Baki 💪🏾😤
Hoho
I got my money on Baki
Battle of Cook and spirit XD
I’m team keagan
Ain't no way
This is insane
That Ohma did NOT look better. Gtfo
Feel like they should at least fuckin finish kengen 1st.
Virgins.....assemble..!!!❤
A tie
TU NO METE CABRA SARA BANBICHE
I can't believe who will win the match
Uia!!!
WHATTTT?!? I NEVER WOULD'VE SEEN THIS COMING FROM NETFLIX THEMSELVES!!!  Ohma gotta do his PP training soon if he wants any chances of winning!!!
money is on baki
So who y’all got ? I think Baki is winning !
so baki is now part of the dumbell anime
まぁ結局ケリはつかないなんて落ちなんだろうけど　それでもドリームマッチではある
Yes please
E sem lógica esses dois se enfrentar, quem vai ser o protagonista 🤦
Dawg why do this to me
Baki wins
Chat, is this real?
Guess I gotta watch kengan ashura now
I see a problem in who they want to win... must be some lame ass result
A month and a week left until it drops? So close yet so far away😭😭😭 mark my words........April is gonna feel like an eternity to most of us
I've waited too long for this. I am so happy
Place your bets!
crazy
I'm glad they went with Baki's art style.
IT'S HAPPENING IT'S HAPPENING
I am sooo ready for this like damn
am i dreaming or is NETFLIX MAKING GOOD DECISIONS???
Ssssssooooooopppppppeeeerrrrrr
Baki will win
Common its definitely Baki😂
Buddy better keep walkin he dont want nothing to do with baki
No way collab?! 😳
서양에선 선 우롱 저평가 오지네
and neither of them wins
got this fight before gta 6
They have to nerf baki for this
Ohma: "I am you, Baki" Baki: "I am you, Ohma"
This isnt even a fair fight. Baki wins easy asf
Really nice, I am looking forwart to it. but SPOILER it will be a draw. I can't imagine that Netflix let win someone of them. That would end in a real big shitstorm from the fan base. Maybe there will come another strong enemy in the end, and they will fight him togther.
fuck yeah
vs Hokuto no Ken
Im already imagining how tf will they try to defeat yujiro or baki💀💀💀  Tell me im wrong like wtf bro yujiro aint human no more
StG dont gas us up 😮
Yujiro VS Kiryu Kazuma
이왜진?
Shit, now I actually have to watch Kengan
I had a feeling these two animes were going to colab
Just put Baki in Tekken 8 already.
Ohma would get rekt
I am sure they will not have a true battle to completion but I am backing Baki straight up
Why is ohma look like baki?
Wait actually?
Is this really happening..!?
Imagine we get the Street Fighter crossover as well animated 😭
I am super hyped for this. Will totally watch it.   With that being said. They will HELLA buff ohma for this matchup cause feat wise and power wise baki>ohma
Holyyy
Please don't pinch me
Isn't this going to be a straight ez win for Baki or am I missing something here?
AI getting out of hand, there's no way this is real
Its my birth date😁
Is this for real? I can't believe such thing is happening! Time to renew my Netflix account 😁😁😁
Insane! Best news!
지렷다
AM I FUCKING DREAMING
Hype!
AY YO WHAT FU!
I like Kengan Ashura, but dislike Baki
Unfair as hell.
Bro WHAT  ?  THIS IS EPIC
Baki vs legoshi
Gonna end in a draw
Fang vs yujiro
This party is gettin crazy🎉
Baki wins it’s on his show
Yeah but its trash tier CGI. Who cares?
Holy Crap! Kengan in 2D looks nice

Ohma Tokita>Baki Hanma

God thank you for having me birth into this generation. Amen.
The crossover we needed💯
Schizo vs Autistic
**In Bruce Buffer Voice**       iiIIIIT'S TIIIIME!!!
cgi are you serious?
please dubbed in hindi of india
Wow, I think this will be a super cool movie, Super👍🏼💥😎
ahh shit now i have to finish both of episodes.
This is going to be peak.
we got kengan ashura vs baki hanma before GTA6
Winner becomes a DLC character in Tekken.
after Toriyamas death, this is a blessing, thank you
Let them Cook❤❤
ohmas so clapped what did they do to my boy
I can't fuckin beleive this!!!!
Ohma died in his own show though lol. He loses by default
this is sooo cool but i think it will be a draw or it would be super fun if yujiro just wins 😂
Nah they are going to create a shock wave if they clash because both being strong is going to be wild
...and the winner will face the champ! (Hercule Satan) 😁
❤
wtf bro?? Baki vs Ohma before GTA6. I'm done bud I'm done.
No way this is real. Wait, is it real?
😍😍😍
yesssirrr
This is we all been waiting for. I didn't expect this to happened.
wait does the mean kengan next season confirmed???
wtf netflix 🤯🤯🤯🤯 i wanna see this
Baki VS Kengan 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
whats the point Baki is obviously stronger
其實最想睇二虎
Oh god it's happening 🔥
Yujiro Hanma comes in midway and whoops both their asses
Would be nice to throw in Record of Ragnarok in there too👍😂
Wait what! 😮
Bro this has to be a draw because there’s no way I’m gonna sit there & watch Baki lose…absolutely not
😮
Make season 3, please.
In a coma confirmed
Finally after father and son legend is gonna take place
Lowkey thought it was the same anime
HAH?!!! Were they even established a shared universe?
Team baki
Y asi es damas y caballeros una vez mas el kengan verso es barrido🗿
I love Ohma as a character (and think he's more interesting than Baki), but the entire Kengan Ashura roster gets brutally powerscaled by the Baki-verse
YOOOOOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kengan Ashura is powerful then yujiro ?
YEAH, BUDDY!!
They actually did it
HOLY SHIT
Haven’t been this hype since lupin the 3rd vs detective Conan
Va a ser tan bueno como baki vs pickle
Ohma looks 😂😂
Bro we already know baki gonna cook instead of showing still how about dropping another season of ashura
Kengan ashura nem terminou e vcs lançando colaboração, tem vergonha não Netflix?
its over for baki
Hope it's not fan made?😢
Ayo i really needed this
Easy Baki W
And i thought its fan made..
Bro i feel like im making this shit up in my head. This is nuts
They'll both draw, or collab to fight the enemy.
Damn! Can't wait 🤙🏼
No way!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤ this is sooooo amazing ❤
The 2 best martial arts anime having a clash, Big Netflix W
aint no way😂😂 dis the type o shit  niggaz and weaboo do debates on dem niggaz actually did a reall anime😂😂😂
Guys, I think we have underestimated the immense power Netflix has to rile up the Baki and Kengan Ashura community.
Nani!
Netflix the GOAT for this
Please let this happen I love this idea  Baki vs kengan
No fucking way
Yea! Finally they are going to fight
I love martial arts animes, *this is my wet dream*
Nem ferrando
Saitama : Hah? Ok!
W anime, the most legend crossover
I can't breath!!
I thoght it would be 2D vs 3D
Baki all the way
Cosmos n Setsuna n Devil Lancer holy shit
Yeesssssssssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
We all know it'll be a tie, or have some interruption.
I'm getting the Rock vs Vin diesel vibes. Both are going to do an equal amount of damage and take the same.
YES!!!
The one we didn't ask for out loud but got it anyway! 🤌 The anime gods have honored us brothers!
I don’t believe it yet
Yujiro vs Kuroki Gensai Jack Hanma vs Raian Kure Biscuit Oliva vs Julius Reinhold  Pickle vs Wakatsuki Speck vs Bando Yohei Dr. Kureha Shinogi vs Dr. Hanafuse Orochi Doppo vs. Muteba Gizenga Kaku Kaioh vs. Kanoh Agito Sirkosky vs. Lihito Kono Haruo vs. Nomi no Sukune II Mohammad Ali Jr. vs. Kaolan Wongsawat Gaia vs. Ryo Inaba Gouki Shibukawa vs. Mokichi Robinson Retsu Kaioh vs. Saw Paing Kaoru Hanayama vs. Jun Sekibayashi
Now this. This is better than Jujushit Copysen
I'm calling it. No one will win as some common enemy will show up for them to dog on...
Thank god it’s the baki animation style 🙏
What the hell are they cooking. If they don’t heavily lowball Baki, it’s literally a 2 second fight.
Cool
Ok but can they beat Goku?
SO THEY DO SHARE THE SAME UNIVERSE
Kengan get animated in the baki style is hype
So Netflix is just doing a death battle? alright
OH MY GOD🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
no way its on my birthday😭😭
I thought this was going to be an April Fool's joke.
북두신권과 콜라보 하자
O problema é que é com essa animação migué, dahora é dá uma caprichada
Lmao Baki solos 😂
Question is what style this Baki vs Kengan will have , anime or that 3D ish style of Kengan ?
Baki universe is stupidly OP. If they meet in the middle, it would be a good fight.
Time Tokita
Tokita 🎉🎉
The universe listens 😂
nobody wins because yujiro will crash that party and beat the crap out of them. that's just him.
😂😂😂 I bet we won’t even get a clear victor they finna team up at the end to beat the dog sh*** out of a rando 🥴
Kenyan Ashura isn't worthy
PP so hard it could put a hole in concrete
????what no way
YOOO WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME
wtf, well this came out of the blue
HELL YEAH
Na difference too big, Baki is too fictional where they are plumped to the point they should utterly die, they dont. Kengan is more realistic, they can actually break and die when they're supposed to.
Neither will win and they become bros but never see eachother again.
all this hype for a draw i bet lol
Better than better than old woke tube Here compared to this garbage Netflix is beginning to look a whole lot better
This use to be my show lol haven’t watched it in a while. I been binge watching One Piece finally tho. I would’ve been mad if I watched One Piece when it first came out lol now I can watch all the seasons without the bullshit
No way 🔥
Is that real or I just dreaming??
So I wanna know who does everybody got me personally I might have to get Baki but idk
Am i hallucinating?
They adapting that chapter where Doppo had to fight a kengan fighter? The it ended on a stand off between ohms and Baki, but we never got the fight lol
TEAM BAKI
Ashura be like: My Mother name is Martha
Bro WHAT
The true ultimate battle. One shall stand, One shall fall. I'm already getting goosebumps
Don't just do a draw have someone actually win
I hope y’all know they’re gonna end up having a fight where it’s essentially a tie but both weren’t going all out… only to do a team fight against their villain counterparts 😅
VA ROMPER EL INTERNET 🗣‼️‼️‼️
Team Baki here!
Hopefully they use ashuras fighting style and not bakis...punch...explain..punch..style.
SONUNDA OROSPU COCUKLARI
I hope the fights are as impressive as in kengan ashura.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The fuck !?
Niko style gang.  Also - when are the final episodes of Kengan Ashura coming up? The last I read, it was at some point this year but no date has been given.
Yujiro hanma solos baki and kengan verse low diff
Kengan Ashura deserved a better anime. If ur gonna do cgi, at least make it good.
No way
End of baki anime was shit imo 🙄
Yo con 28 años .... Wuuuuuuuuiuuuju
Baki vs ippo when?
i mean canonically speaking Ohma gets absolutely fucking obliterated with literally no effort on Baki's part in the slightest but nonetheless im insanely hyped for this
AYOOOOOO
Oy what kind of fake shit is a this
Imagine they had put it in that goofy CGI shit
Wtf Omg what's going on I love the two series so hard ❤❤❤❤❤ 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Less goooooo!!!!
its funny cus either Baki wins and Yujiro remains a proud dad or He doesnt and yujrio going to Beat his son for being a loser
Is this even real? Its finally happening
Kengan Ashura
H-how is this possible?!?!!?!?!
This will be the greatest show DEVIOUS hands I will ever see
NOWAYYYY
Haven't been this excited since dragon's dogma 2
Imagine just how cool the mashup battles Would Be: Ohma vs Baki Raian vs Jack Hatsumi vs Shibukawa Julius vs Oliva Kanoh vs Hanayama 💀
Baki's finna one shot bro
WAIT WHAT IS HAPPENING??!?!?!??!
Am an Omha Tokita fan but Baki is too op man 😭
Aint no way!
NAHH CAUSE WHY I WAS ASKING PEOPLE WHO WOULD WIN💀💯
Baki: *looks to Ohma* "..."  Ohma: *looks to Baki* "..."  Baki & Ohma: "You look really strong...RUN ME YOUR POCKETS!"
LET’S GO!!! 😃😆🔥
No way 😱
Team Baki. Never forget the classics and how far they’ve come.
The disrespect. Baki Hanna vs Kengan?  Baki is sitting on the thrown in his universe Kengan is still climbing. Didn't even finish his plate yet and challenging a king? Shit crazy
Please tell me it's real
Your movie Bandai Namco, I dare you to put Baki and Ohma in Tekken
Coryxkenshin: Nah, I'd win🍷🗿🧔🏾
Ha ha what a timeline!
Holy fuck this is real
Now they just need to add them into Tekken 8 as guest characters and we ballin
I mean it's always crossed my mind but holy hell I never thought something like this would happen!!!!!!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆
Let’s go baki
BRO NO WAY THEY GONNA DO THIS
OMG ESTO VA A SER EPICO PAPUS
Might guy beat both asses easy
How is baki still in high-school
HOLY SHIT THIS IS A W
Bro I just want yall to give me kengan ashura s2 p2 😧😧
I saw a post about this on Facebook and thought it was click bait...WOW!!!
What? No. I just want both series to continue separately I don't give a fuck about them facing off it makes no sense.
Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.  Mark 11:24 NIV Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.Proverbs 6:25 NIV🥰
I bet that Baki will win.
Ai o bicho vai pegaaaa 😎
Baki Bout To Beat The Breaks Off Dude 😂😂
oh my gosh omgomgomg
AYO WTF.....I'M DREAMING WHAT IS THIS! THIS IS AWESOME
HOPE YOU USE THE BAKI ANIMATION AND NOT KENGAN PLEASE I DONT WANT BAD CGI
I’ll renew my Netflix subscription for this shit😭😭😭
goofy ahh fan service sh1t
IS THIS REAL? THIS HAS TO BE FAKE OMGGG
Awesome!
wtf who going to win
No way 😂 netflix is finally cooking?
baki slams sadly
ON MY BIRTHDAY TOO ❤❤❤😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Im excited but baki is clearly gonna win especially after beating his father who was the strongest being of all mankind 💪
Well I’ll be damned Netflix is chill
Bro, they didn't even finish Ashura's tournament, now the timeline is ruined.(still epic)
eeeeeeeeeeeeeebat'
I’m just saying they animated it in BAKI’s style soooo good luck to this SIDE CHARACTER 😂😂😂
This is going to be dope
Sure enough baki no diff
Wait is this legit?
Baki should win but this will be fire
Bring out the next kengan season instead of this
I rather see the lore about Baki's dentist than this crap.
But baki is og  !!!!
nem fodendo
Finally we can put this debate to rest
If this shit is real is going to be a hell of a battle
esto parece una mentira.  . .
Omgggggg
يعني ايه 😯
I love the other guy, but the crap that baki pulls because of the demon back...
Baki! The son of yujiro hanma! 😈
sz sz
Holy shit it’s actually real
Finally
Bruh, Kengan just joined in Baki verse then he will lose.
so this is like kong and godzilla🔥🔥🔥
No freaking way wtf!!!!! I need to start watching kengan ashura tho...  Baki will win 100% I HOPE...
Only baki guys
Siiii $iiii $iiiiiii $iii
Ain't No way
Hell yeah can we get the swordsman arc after that as well
I just came in my pants so fuking hard
This happened in a manga collab between the authors. If this anime follows the manga collab then yall ain't gonna like how it ends 😂
Au début j'étais hypé, mais voir que ce sera l'animation de Baki et pas Kengan me rend perplexe.
Hell yeah😤😤
Aaayooooooii
My body is ready 💪🏾🙌🏾
I hope we get new kengan season soon
anime doing all the heavy lifting for entertainment.
This is cool but also it's dumb beacuse Ohma is literally set to die and they haven't even put out a 3rd season him.
KENGAN VERSE IS GETTING OBLITERATED 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ohma cannot survive fighting baki. Baki makes absolutely no sense
Ogre needs to fight Pickle
They gonna nerf baki so bad
Baki vs Kengan before GTA VI is wild bro
All this just for Yujiro to beat them both
i literally tried to watch that ashura show but the cgi was so bad i stopped 5 mins in
Mind blowing oh shit !!!
Mostly likely will be a draw 😅
Coin toss outcome.  Coin lands standing
BRO WTF SINCE WHEN NETFLIX STARTED MAKING CROSSOVERS OMFG NETFLIX FUCKING LOVE YOU (even tho you haven’t released season 5 of stranger things yet and been making weird. Show lately) but idc Netflix you’ve earned my respect today 🗿🔥🔥🔥
Pray for Baki❤❤❤
HOLY FUCK !
Estou sonhando?
Baki is winning this jawn
When this popped up,I ran arnd like a kid on a sugar high🤣🤣🤣
Baki and kengan tho it’s two different types of anime tho fights are almost the same but it’s kinda ehhh like keep it real lol they can’t just have Baki beat him up and win and vice versa
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OHHH MY GOD
Baki easily wins. Ohma is new to none cgi graphic world so he gained 3% body fat which will slow him down
Really ? Are you kidding us ? What do these two anime have to do with each other, aminakoyayim!
rip ohma i like kengan more but yh lol😅 idc about those 2 I NEED TO SEE JACK VS RAIAN
It would be cool if there was a definitive winner. I'm team Baki, tho
I pet on Kengan
And just when I thought my Birthday wasn’t gonna get better.   Thank You Netflix!
more excited for this than the tyson fight
WTF😨😨😨
sayyyyWHAAAAATTT??!! AINT NO WAYYY!!
Yujiro is gonna third party, beat both of their asses and leave again
Bro I waited for season 2 and u blueballed me then ur doing this what the hey
Bet its gonna be both of them vs Yujiroat the end , lmao and still lose
Two worlds collide
Baki  is gonna win
Daaamn my boy Ohma boutta die a second time💀😭
So.. are they going to scale the Kengan characters to Baki characters? I don’t think any kengan character can match yujiro sadly and a few other baki characters may solo. I do want to see one of the Kure clan members go against someone during it though.
THE MOAN I JUST LET OUT I LOVE THIS NEW GEN OF FIGHTERS
This sounds so bloody stupid. I love both these anime, but what's the point in combining them other than fan service and a cash grab. Are they that out of ideas they'll just smash two thing together and hope for the best! I mean maybe I'll be wrong, but my inital reaction is this will be pish. I will edit my comment at release lol. If I'm wrong, im wrong lol.
I might have to watch the Kengan Ashura series now. Grrrrr
This is actually sick. Me and my homie were just debating and I think Baki will win. But I like the other anime better.
Lol…I prefer Kengan. But…Baki can clear the ground with the face of Tokita, or even Agito or Kuroki Gensai.
........Hold on.......is this legit??
Holy. This is real?
Holy shit, this is real?!?! I thought they were trolling hard af!!
Did they get Yujiro's approval first?
Is this real?
Is this real?😮
I think baki would win but it would be a close call
Is this even Legal?
What the f.....
Kengan Ashura
Bruh...they literally said "strongest high school student vs inheritor of the niko style" 😂😂😂 Also seeing ohma in 2d is cool
Total BS movie. Ohma Tokita in the Hanma style. He will look so stupid 🤣🤣🤣 What a waste
Wait a minute....is this legit!?
Whaaattttt 😮😮😮
Wish they would also make a Goku vs Saitama death battle in the future
Thankgod 😢 i'm so excited !!!
There will be more crossovers like this one only if it breaks a most watched record or viewership record.
OMG!!!!
omg nice
koi jaga do mereko
Good idea but I wish we had more Kengan animes bevor that. Bakis journey is almost over, while Kengan is still in his early stage
come on netflix make hajime no ippo s4 🙏
Baki  ez
Gonna be Fire i swear
Holy shit its real
This is real? 🤯
Ngl I thought they were going to do one between ROG and Kengan, the similarities are almost uncanny
easy win kengan ashura
I wish creators would do this more often. Settle the arguments
🔥🔥🔥🇧🇷 aguardando.
Nuke vs ant 💀
oh my goddddd
Its about to get Real!!!
damn we must be dreaming boys LMAO!
Bruh🤯
Vai ser muito foda slk 🔥
Surprising but not unexpected
Makes me wanna workout right now.
This is the best timeline.
Baki solo
Kiichi from Tough:
Welp Buying A Membership Now 😂
ohma explode baki like nothing
Wtf
People who think BAKI is unrealistic must've never heard about SHAOLIN's training. They probably only watch UFC and Boxing.  They doesn't know that a real human out there can actually turn their body parts into weapons through intense and deadly training.
Who y’all got
Getting goosebumps.....it will be epic..🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro this Is hard
Netflix must be reading the comments
Thought this was fake lol
Baki's gonna fkn kill him but I'm sure they'll make it look even for entertainment
I've never watched kengan ashura. I guess I'll have to start.
Fuck yoooooo. That’s dooooooope
The Connector vs Yuijiro Hanma
This have to be fake lol
The actual fight will probably be like 3 minutes with 20 being backstory and explanation of power levels in science class format.
Speed vs power!!
Is this for real? Alright.
More hype than mcgregor mayweather
Then get them both in tekken after
What. But guys remember Baki and Yujiro fought and no one is a true winner/loser. This thing kinda can end like that  But Baki wins. My boy will.
Isn't ashura a show full of trash cringe CGI? why would anyone care about it
🗿🍷 E
What is this? A CROSSOVER EPISODE?
So hows this even a match...Baki universe is way stronger than KA universe 🙂
"Baki vs Kengan"  *Yujiro wins*
I’m pretty sure it’ll end up a draw cu then both animes’ fans would be mad if either of them lost. So i don’t really care that much
this is a crazy dream come true for all Kengan fans
Ohma TOKITA !!!
Oh it's on. Fighters delight
Alright i will watch Kengan Ashura
Next time do it vs goku
NOOOOOO NO DIOS MIO SI ES UN SUEÑO NO ME DESPIERTEN.
No way in hell they actually made this real
how would this be a fight? easy no dif baki catches the dub ez. Ohma ain't even maste this own style yet bruh baki learned it all and more smh
So it is basically baki vs everybody in kengan ashura 😂😂
Doesn't make sense. If they're in the same universe, how didn't this happen earlier given they're always chasing the strongest for a fight in both series.
This better then tyson vs paul
april is around the corner , i don't feel safe
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Impossible 😮
wait what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact ashura dies in the end proves hes gonna loose to baki. Yes spoilers in the final manga, ashura dies in the end of his series cause he overused his body, didn't even defeat the main villian
This is actually insane.
shii
They give us this instead of another season of their anime lmao
Can't wait!
Am I dumb or it would be too ez for baki?
Baki washes
Only issue with Kengan Ashura is the shitty 3d animation.
YA VALIO VRGAAAAAAAA🎉🎉🎉❤
YOOOO AINT NO WAY
YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!! 💥💥💥💥
OMG
This real?????????????????
Great present for my birthday 🎉🎉
lets Fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
☠️☠️☠️  Baki is gonna murder him for warm up 🤣😭🤣
They both monsters but I'm preety sure baki wipes
TEAM OHMA 👇
REAL ASF FOR THIS
Testosterone: The Anime.
Aaaaaaaaa🗿🚬
REALLY?
💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eso es real?
Baki team
LETS GOOOOOOO🥋
Power wise Baki shouldn't really have any issues here, even if Tokita uses his 'demon' powers.
kkkkkkk ta de sacanagem! mentes explodindo!!!
COMMON OHMA!
They treating this shi like UFC. Wtf. 😂❤
AYO LESTGOOOO NO FUCKING WAAAAY
Holy crap, I can't wait until June for the slugfest to begin!
siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
No way
I watched non of Kengan. Gonna check it out
Boys, this is going to be amazing. If it's a 90minute movie, imagine how good the animation could be! A whole seasons budget in the length of 6 episodes, and we get to see the Kengen boys in 2D for a fight too, finally!
Baki wins and it wouldn’t even be close
April 1. Is approching, that's all im saying....
Коллаб который заслужил мужик, который в начале кричал
What will you name it? Asuraki? Bakisura? Bashuraki?
as awesome as this collab is i wish to see Baki Hanma and the Ogre in Kengan Ashura animation.
Can’t wait to also see jack vs raihan or doppo vs kuroki in this.
one of my dreams comes true
Woh...
This is fucking crazy can’t believe this wtf
Coisa linda!
YOu gotta be shitting me
ITS HAPPENIG I CANT BELIEVE IT!
See guys Ohma tokita can face Baki
WTF, just give me rest of Kengan Ashura / Omega.
It most likely will be a draw between them or yujiro going wild and knocking them both out
NETFLIX is thriving off of anime right now. They tapped the market and are reaping the rewards.
ohma gona cook
Oh snap
I didn't want the baki style animation for kengan ashura
We got Baki Hanma Vs Kengen Ashura before GTA VI 🤣🤣🤣
3 d ? Or good animation 😅😂😂😂
It's just gonna be a tie.
I don't like the appearance of Ohma with Baki art style.
The real fight is actually Baki fans vs Ohma fans 😂😂😂
Fight: Baki  Girlfriend: Ashura  Tekken: Yujiro  It is coming.... AND SO AM I.
Netflix should do more of these type of stuff
Somebody call Kichi Miyazawa
all the reddit battles and comparisons didn't go to waste
This is so cool from Netflix. They are keeping their anime roster fresh every year, and thats not easy to do at all.  Personally i prefer Kengan Ashura to Baki, and a versus matchup would be great. I hope the animation is done Kengan style, as those guys are awesome!!!
This shit too good to be true, like I could just wake up tomorrow and it's just gonna be a mandela effect and this trailer never existed
Hope they don’t end up doing the same crap as Dragon ball x Toriko x One Piece where the main characters were equal and actually gives a clear winner here.  Rooting for Baki anyday based on feats  Some shit tells me, on third case scenario, a common villain finna make his appearance and fuck up their rivalry forcing them to team up and jump him together which is gonna piss me off
but at least finish kengan ashura
aint no fucking way
Been thinking about this ever since I finished Baki (I watched Kengan ashura before Baki) and now this came out, I’m excited
Now, all we need is a bloody fight between the three ultra powerful, evil, and unstoppable martial arts dads: Yujiro Hanma, Geese Howard, and Heihachi Mishima
I wonder who will win. Baki. Kengan. The thing that will inevitably appear making them team up and part ways as equals. Who truly know?
I love both animes but my boy Ohma is about to get bodied ☠️
Death battle “I won't do this”  Netflix: fine…ill do it myself
Well we know who is going to win, but i'm excited still.
waiting for baki hanma season 3
HOLY SHIT
Is this real? I dont want to wake up and go to school now please more five minutes of this dream
Wow.. 👍🏾👍🏾💪🏾💪🏾😁😁
this is my superman vs goku
but baki would win though
Baki got this
Someone tell me this is fucking fake already!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine in the mids of battle some third party will come and beat them both, then they will team up but still get destroyed. Then yujiro will come to help them or yujiro will tell them to sit down and watch as he fought toe to toe with that someone while smiling because after a long time someone will be a challenge for him. Or maybe that third party is someone that yujiro knew, like his mentor or someone who beats him up or enter Heihachi maybe?
I can’t believe we are getting this epic battle before gta 6 💀
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I want Ohma to win.... please combat gods, give Ohma the W.😢
good🔥
Yujiro slap kengan ashura verse neg diff
0:16 they look exactly the same.
Is this real??????????
Am I dreaming? Are we trapped in Madara's Infinite Tsukuyomi? This.... this cannot be. I was waiting for a death battle, but Netflix has taken it into their own hands. Netflix Anime department is cooking.
I haven’t even watched the shows and I’m hype.
Did ohma finish he's Tournament
Nah I sleep it's going to be awesome
2d vs 3d
baki hanma ☠️ death wish omm ☠️ i never been so excited for a calab baki hanma ☝️🔥 i watched both and got to say baki no diff 💀☠️🙏
Thats way better then Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul
They announced this like 4 years ago but I thought they cancelled it due to covid. Now I’m hyped asf again
O SHIT 😮😮😮
GENTLEMEN, BUCKLE UP… IT’S FINALLY HAPPENING **screams in the office**
is it real??
didnt expect this from netflix at all, they really listened to the fans this time huh?
amv linkinpark
Hype..
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2024 is a nice year for anime fans fr
NEXT WE NEED NARUTO VS GOKU
Is this real?!?
This was supposed to come out like in 2020 lol
I can't handle this
i was pretty sure its just gonna be a documentary/power scaling type of shi BUT NO they actually made an anime of it…  WE HYPE FOR THIS
The profecy was real all along
Kengan finna get his cheeks clapped 😭😭
I’m with it
Okay I’m not sure about manga Vs manga really being the curve stomp so many say it is. The biggest destructive number I know of for Yujiro is an earthquake stopping punch. In Kengan Ashura there is a character called Watakashi or some spelling like that during a fight where a punch from him shook an entire mountain. This character Ohma does beat I believe without using his advance.  So earthquake Vs mountain shaking thing are pretty damn comparable strength wise.  Speed wide Yujiro can punch between Mach 3 and Mach 15. Do to being able to catch a sword swing within a meter between .0001-.0009 seconds.  While Ohma scales to characters who can have movement speed around Mach 2.4. Which the difference between movement speed and punching speed is about 3.75x. Which would put both the punching speed of Yujiro and the speedster - Rei - about the same. Rei being Mach 9 punches and Yujiro being between 3-15.  Yes Ohma also scales to Rei.
godzilla x kong
If we be realistic, Kengan Ashura is dead.
Aint no way this gonna happen???!!!  Are we living in a simulation 🤣
Can't wait for people to bring up how Yujiro stopped an earthquake
Oh snap this is gonna be cold
Calling it now there will be no definite winner & they will team up and fight in a tag team fight
I was expecting a Death Battle, not a Netflix film.
This what we were waiting for bois... dreams come true! FINNALY!
Fight of the century 🔥 🔥 🔥
So its like batman vs superman they teamup defeat evil madafacka
Netflix te perdono todo el contenido progre pero por favor no la cagues con esto
Baki finna rock his shit
bro aintnoway
Thanos:  Fine, I'll do it myself.
THIS IS INSANE!!!  Team Tokita Ohma!!
NAH THIS CAN'T BE REAL,NO FUCKING WAY
Someone pinch me, am I in a dream?
Just hope the animation is the Kengan one and not that crap of sliding images with epileptic light from baki
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Hindi official dub 🥹🥹
Wow! Just wow! Baki vs Kengan. And to be honest, I have no idea which character will win. Can't wait to see this on Netflix. This is like Godzilla vs Gamera.... Kenshiro vs Jotaro.... Titan Hulk vs Doomsday. Awesome stuff.
Baki look small in his anime but his heigh are average like ohma.
baki!!!
It’s like Kong and Godzilla. They gotta go at each other first then smash everything moving together!!
FK BAKI VS OHMA,  I WANT SHEN WULONG VS YUJIRO HANMA just a little fight is enough for me PLEASE I NEED THIS FIGHT so we can end the debate of this two FINAL boss
I will win with ashura 😎🔥
iam looking forward to our friendly neighborhood macho man
Will this be even a fight ? I mean, isn't the current baki nearly on par with yujiro???
Wow! That's awesome
This was originally supposed to be Baki vs Kenichi like 20 years ago 😂  Also I Kengan Ashura is too early for dude to have enough feats. But fuck it. Im still hype.
Is this real!!
I felt  like I manifested this! Let's gooo!!
I'm so excited 😆
I’m glad they chose to use Bakis style it’s a bit cleaner.
bro Baki is going to COOK him
huh?
If this is real, boys we are dreaming❤
holy pog wtf no way
Bakek lmao.
Ohma in 2D is better than the cgi
It’d be a close fight actually. Baki has more might but Ohma Has more skill plus both have skill sets with moves that can KO one another. Ohma’s obviously being the Demon bane.
If we're keepin it a buck, this fight wouldn't even be close. Baki would win without even trying.
I Do NOT want to see any of them dies, but I do want them to fight
Look how they massacred my boy ohma. Would be better if they adopted kengan's animation
this fight is gonna last like this teaser
The only thing i know is Jack will be used as a punching bag lol
Best combo i been waiting for
Damn my testosterone feel rising up
BCCCC , IS THIZ FOR REALLLLL ?????? 🤯😭
Ngl netflix anime department have been cooking 5 michelin star content here
💀
I think ohma take unexcepted buff beacuse this movie need to be long
The only two manly Anime Series that existed in a field of "Trendy" Animes where the MC is always a twink.
whhhhhAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!!!
Baki claps im hyped  Edit: Totally not biased😅
This fight is definitely about to be craaaazy tho 😂😂
I haven't seen Kengan Ashura but I'm a big fan of Baki, is he a good fighter? Cuz in baki universse, there is infitie blood supply, random endorphine boosts, demon backs etc etc exist
So are they in the same universe?
whuttttt???!!!
Yes.
yooooooo 2d Ohma
My favourite anime
As long as they don’t animate it in shitgi I’ll watch it
The ending be like: Both Baki & Ohma shaking hands and appreciating their strengths  Come back to this comment if thats what happens.
i hope they don't do the "mc vs mc, no clear winner, gets mutual respect, teams up to beat up villain." thing. I want a crystal clear winner on this one.
I would never expect this 💀 Im HYPED
DAMN THAT FIGHT WILL BE SO 🔥🔥
Idk who the other dude is but Baki boutta lump him up
Tie
its about to go down 😮
And this isnt even a death battle on youtube. But we do need a wiz and boomstick providing comparisons on who would win this death battle!
Of course it will end with a tie
Esto va ser legendario.
😍😍🔥
they're gonna have to nerf baki 70% for this fight
Chat is this real?
ooooohhhhh maaaaahhhh gaaahhhh is this real????!!!!!
Bruh finally and it’s releasing on my birthday 😆
Dear Netflix If you cancel this there's gonna be bounties in your head
feels like lucid dream, cant wait
Bro the amount of times I’ve thought about this can’t believe neztflix is making it happen
Epic battle of the grapplers
TF you guys are serious, right?
Baki's gonna body Ohma.
2 MC we got there , they will both WIN
Are it for real man I gonna love it
Now all i need is Mishima vs Hanma family
The trailer alone had enough testosterone to put biceps on my balls
The day after my birthday 🥳 Thanks Netflix!
It’s Netflix it won’t happen
Omg what! I thought this was a fan video,  then I saw the video is on the offical netflix channel. Had to check the date too just in case this was an April fools joke.   Nope. Real. The dream is real boys.
Demon vs Monster lets see whos winning
Unexpected Expectation
Wtf?
The fight will be about 3 minutes long over 3 22 minute episodes 😂
Nah, this is actually incredible
❤
wtfffff
if this fight happens the only winner will be audience
Guys the time has come to repurchase Netflix subscription the whole thing I'd never expect is coming up now❤❤
YES! But Ohma looks weird in this art style xD
YEEEAAHH LESSGOOO
ohhhh shitttt
So this is really real…? 🤔 might give this a go, even though both of each last seasons weren’t that good respectively.
i hope its manga version of tokita ohma, he is MUCH stronger in the manga than the anime
for me kengan ashura is better than baki
lesgoooooooooooooo i hope baki wins(probably its gonna be tie tho cuz both fandoms have crazy fanbase)
why not Tokito Ohma? Does this mean 1 vs the whole anime?
hanma can kill him like a insect. ohma is nothing to hanma
What the heck? No freakin way.
My dream come true
Wtf 😮💀
Bro this is lit
baki would wash kengan verse
I'm about to suck Netflix's dick
Baki after knowing from his father that he is the winner :: Dad🗿
As long is doesn’t end with imaginary soup, I’m all for it 😂
Because of Kengan i started training Mma now im 5 years in with one Bad Knee and so much Hype for this movie that i've might have to book a fight before this movie releases so i don't explode with the amount of Joy i feel right now
Omg😢
this is like anime avengers wtf
What if they don't fight
shit actually all of us were waiting for
I do not see the point, unless it is a one episode promotional thing.
Omg this is amazin crossouver 🎉
뭐에요 이왜진
6 Juin 1 vs 1  gar du nord c'est noté
Hopefully they do a full tournament. Probably not but would be super hype.
Yujiro vs The connector Shen Wu Long
they definitely are going to end it on a draw
ooooooooooooooooh wtf
I think, that was a joke... ok, will see.
Bruh just finish ashura and get to omega
I think the ending of this will be pretty dissatisfying
Que raro se ohma en 2D
What in the actual hell?😳😳😳😳😳😳
BAKI will be nerfed
Huge W
IT ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENED ?
Finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary!!!
we feasting then boys
Baki Ez win
Netflix really cookin grown adults out here Netflix really like we'll do the fan edit OurSelves Netlix really said "-*Just Do It*-" Netflix really said $&#@ your feelings It's a crazy time we live in
Tf
Early April fool?
Nmms se ve genial
Holy sh*t. I like ohma but i can definitely say baki will be the one in the end
No fucking way
Damn holy shit 🔥🤟
Got my money on kengen🎉
Baki wins
Real or fake?
I'm not expect that...
I thought they were joking, a fan made thing but its actually happening. That's fantastic.
how??????
Daamn didnt expect netflix to pull out something cool.. Lets hope they dont make Baki female lgbt🤦‍♂️
HOLYYYY SHIIIIIIIIIIIITTTT
Tokito is not strong as baki man.
still less bullshit than mike vs jake
初めまして上野ユリですよろしくね(∩´∀｀＠)⊃めっちゃイケボでかっこいいよね❤好き😊
Wow just just amazing 😍
No one is going to win. I bet my life on it.
Awsome ❤
judging by art style they are in the baki universe. but tbh they should not give an actual answer. Both are completely different. Kengan focuses on realistic fighting with the anime twist, where baki nowadays has become random bs technique go. don't get me wrong baki is entertaining but it's not about the actual fighting anymore.
It's going to be a draw ✏️ get it? Lol
Honestly, if Kengen Ashura is in Bakis verse, it makes a lot of sense
no fucking way
YOOOOOO!!!!
Bro Baki slams 🙏🏼🙏🏼
ho my God I have been wanting years for this!!!!
what about season w part 2? of kengan ??? whheeennn ?  btw this gonna blow netflix server down 😁
Why did they animate ohma like that it does not look good they have to do it better
Wa
Omg its on my birthday day lol
I can't help but wodner if it wil be in Baki's style than we won't have a big fight.... knowning the writing of Baki it won't be a fight at all. On the other hand, it is good to see Ohma again
This is the most beautiful thing i have seen
Wtf... Just don't mess up with the animation
Oh my f* god !
In terms of animation  I prefer to see this in Kengan Ashura animation
Omae no namaewa…
surely baki would won, ohma not complete yet to be the successor, there's continuation on Kengen Omega...different with baki that always OP and always getting stronger then match with stronger opponent
This can't be real Am i dreaming chat?
Its over
Yooo a crossover!!!
Baki getting his salad tossed 😭🙏🏾
😮😮😮
This is going to be insane
Wtf I'm so hyped bruh i need to see that asap 😂😂😂
while they're at it, they might as well battle for the title of ugliest artstyle too
this is fever dream
All right. Now I can expect Deadpool literally breaking the fourth wall
Noooo way this is real, people have been talking about this match up for years 😲😲😲😲😲😲
Can't wait
How is this possibile
Im waiting for Tokyo Revenge series ..
Na this can't be 😂 2024 is a fucking legendary year man 😂 ❤ everything is so fire to the movies life on another planet this shit got crazy
IM SO FUCKING HARD RIGHT NOW 👊👊👊
Ainz Ooal Gown vs Rimuru Tempest Please!!!!!!!!!
whenever there's a cross over between two main characters from different series, there's gonna be a villain where the main characters join forces and fight them off
Ayo! what!!!!????? i hope this is real cause i never saw this coming just wished for it
Baki: Nah, I'd win
Yes daddy!!
bro i was waiting for this moment. Like its a dream come true. let's gooooooo.
Your personality shines in every video
Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us
Women watchers better take birth control before watching this, especially if you're next to your boyfriend. The amount of testosterone will be intense!
Your channel is a hidden gem!
Baki should win no problem
What the? Holy shit
This is The Greatest collaboration ever...
Is it stupid? Yes, is it comparing a legend tier mma fighter to a punching god who can knock buildings and tanks? Yes, am i going to watch this? Of course!!!!
No 3d animation? Hell yeah
thats why they took long for boff animes to continue
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤
I mean as much as I like Kengan Ashura...lets be real.... Baki stomping Ohma
Oh okay...there it is...i found a reason to stay alive 😂
I watch kengan Ashura my friend watches baki I see it as a absolute win
The fuck a official crossover
Ohh yeah the Nico style against baki amazing
They're going to have to nerf Baki or exponentially buff Oma because Baki characters are absurdly strong.
Baki solos 😂
This can't be true 🤣🤣🤣
HOLY FUCK MORE ORIGINAL CONTENT FROM BAKI
WOW, WHAT THE FV5K
Not saying kengen will win but Imagine the narrrator says something like “it was at this moment ,Baki knew they were both beasts”
Lets go 🔥
And suddenly Yujiro just come out of the blue and taunt Tokita to fight him instead.
AI generated?
Less goo it's happening and it's even on my birthday!
Shit's about to go down.
😱😱😱👻
Tbh its naultalgic. However, the power scalling of both shows are not the same. Baki scalling is wall breaking and falling from sky scrapers show while Ashura is at best wall cracking.
I'm about to go to sleep and decide to watch one funny short, and this is what I see 🎉😅
watch them nerf baki
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lesssgooooooo
What about devil may cry new anime
The crossover we never thought about but always wanted in our subconscious
Ima lose my mind if it’s true 😮
MAYBE NO MORE KENGEN ASHURA CGI AFTER THIS?
Can you finish Kengan before doing a cross over it has taken you 4 plus year to get through 2 rounds of the tournament
If it takes place in a different verse baki is losing
My only fear is that they're gonna be lazy with the baki-fighting scenes using slideshows.   Eg. Hanayama punching Spec, why to use manga slideshows?
燃起来了
Up to this point I had never heard of kengan ashura, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one....
Their using hand drawn, so I think that’s Baki: 1 and Kengan ashura: 0, so far
Netflix dlc???
We better have a winner.
Our battle will be legendry
Didn't watch kengan cause 3d sucks specially when it comes to anime, it's like playing a fighting game lol
Really?😮
Can’t wait
🔥 🔥 🔥
Bro get ready for 80% of when ever baki fights the narrator starts running his mouth!
Fire crossover fanfic
Movie or episode
I can’t watch this, because they’ll nerf Baki too oblivion. Pulls me right out of the lore they’ve created
What 😮?
Goosebumps 😲😮😲😮😲😮😲😮😲😮😲😮
Baki for the W
Netflix, please animate Tokita Ohma vs Ryu ( Street Fighter ) chapter too.
WHAT THE?!
Guys, is this another one of those fan made trailers?
Wow
Omg😮
Wtf
OMGOMG IM FUCKIN FREAKING OUTTTT
But kengan has not fully awaken yet, unlike Baki
The guys in Baki are Insane...  Then theres Kengen Asura... Bro it could go either way because these  fighters are insanely skilled in both shows.
No fucking way
Gokú les gana
I didn't know I needed this and now I'm angry that I can't have it right now.
This actually makes the most sense.
my goodness
Wtf thats so DOPE
Hype...
Best matchup since capcom vs snk
Y’all which anime is better
BOAI WHAT DA HELL
Baki >>>>>>>
It was just a what if before, but now? Damn!
I'd like to see what shenanigans Yujiro will be up to.
wtf
We eating good this year boys
Can anyone one tell me if this is a series or a movie? Please respond ASAP  my brother is really excited for this!

I'm fucking 30 years old but I'm slightly excited about this 😅😂
TEAM BAKI FTW 😤😤😤
Abb to moza ayy ga 😊😊😊😊
what the f-...NAH THIS HYPED ME UP!!! BRO AINT NO WAY!!!FINALLY!!!!!
COOL!!
Wow! 😮🇧🇷
Their match is gonna end in a draw
Look I know I'ma get a lot of hate but this is cursed...
In hindi or not
It’s gonna be a movie omgg
yeah,, but I guess there would be lot of  nerfing in Baki's team...
AIN'T NO FUCKING WAY
00:00 Loud Nigra
I’m getting excited 😊
The geh anime 🏳️‍🌈
THIS BOUT TO GO HARD 🔥🔥🔥
I have been imagining this for so long , i can't wait
Oh God. No one wanted this. Can't we just get more kengen ashura?
Bro what? Now i gotta watch Kengan Ashura lol
Oh...MY....GOD
So glad they're going with the baki style animation and not that weird 3d bullshit
THE COLLAB IS REAL
What the fuck are the odds.
1) this is powerscallers wet dream 2) there prob gonna team up agaisnt a stronger foe 3) yes it will prob be mid/bad but i will still be watching it
Is this really happening?💀 I'm serious
i wonder how they gonna cook this. (ohma-san passed away at the end)
Well dang
pq minha irma cancelou a netflix??
Whoa.
I wann see yujiro vs raian .... The battle of the devils
This is so insane 🤯
Nah! Am i trippin or am i switch universe aftet a sleep
Finish kengan ashura first, you absolute dingoes
Really????? 🥶
Nah ain’t no way they actually listened to the ppl voices n give what we actually need 🎉
Ohhhhhhh
Wait so this is really happening!!? What about the conclusions to their stand alone series
Seeing Okita in 2D is incredible.  Kengan's 3D art is very ugly, the manga's art borders on perfection, it could be at that level.
오마 쎄긴한데 냉정하게 4천년 가오충 카이오한테도 질 거 같은데
All right so hear me out bandai namco..next put them  both in Tekken 🙏🙇‍♂️
Baki should be victorious if you ever saw “Baki the grappler” the series in 2000 you would know how freakish powerful yujiro is, the dude can stop a earthquake with a single punch, control every blood cell in his body so he can’t get sick.  With that being said yujiro just gets even stronger as time passes by. So imagine how powerful Baki has become.
Tremendo nerfeo le van hacer a baki
Baki is gonna kill ohma.  Rest in peace
Hindi dubbed please🇮🇳🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
TF is this ??????
This gone be so cold
if im sleeping dont you fucking dare to wake me up
The religious liberty and human rights magazine Bitter Winter published an article on October 4, 2023, titled “NGOs at the UN Against Organ Harvesting, While Falun Gong Asks Italy to Save Lives.”  Authored by Marco Respinti, the article reported that two ECOSOC-accredited NGOs published a joint statement at the 54th session of the UN Human Rights Council between September 11 and October 13, 2023, condemning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s organ harvesting crimes targeting Falun Gong practitioners.   According to the report, the statement by the two NGOs, the Coordination des Associations et des Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience (CAP-LC) and the Romanian Independent Society of Human Rights (RISHR), were supported by a wealth of other organizations, including Alianza Iberoamérica Europea Contra el Comunismo (AIECC), China Watch UK, Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), Forum for Religious Freedom Europe (FOREF), the Gerard Noodt Foundation for Freedom of Religion or Belief, the International Society for Human Rights and its branch in Sweden, the International Council for Diplomacy and Dialogue (ICDD), the Korean Association for Ethical Organ Transplants (KAEOT), NPO Transplant Tourism Research Association, the Taiwan Association for International Care of Organ Transplants (TAICOT), and the Rotary Satellite Club of Ending Forced Organ Harvesting.  The statement was drafted based on reports by three leading investigators on the forced organ harvesting crime, including David Kilgour (1941–2022), David Matas and Ethan Gutmann, as well as the final judgement of the “China Tribunal.”  According to Bitter Winter, the statement raised several requests to the UN and its associated agencies, including 1) “call upon the WHO [World Health Organization] that the One Health agenda has to include a verification of the end to forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China”; 2) “call upon the UN Secretary General to initiate a fact-finding mission of forced organ harvesting in China via independent, international, unannounced inspections”; and 3) “call upon the UN Secretary General to inform all 193 member states of the United Nations about China’s persecution of Falun Gong and its unethical forced organ harvesting practice.”  As this year marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and China is a member of the UN Human Rights Council, it should “immediately abide by the guiding principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and end the practice of forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners and any other prisoners of conscience,” said the statement.  The statement noted that several countries, including Israel, Canada, and the United States, “have initiated or passed legally binding legislations that aim to stop or prevent forced organ harvesting of prisoners in China.” Two examples were the House Resolution 343 passed by the U.S. Congress in 2016 and Written Declaration 48 by the European Parliament also in 2016. Also cited in the statement were the more than 3 million signatures collected by Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting in over 50 countries and a statement by 12 Special Rapporteurs to the UN in 2021.  The statement also said that the CCP’s decades of “state-sanctioned, forced organ harvesting of living people” should be indicted as “crimes against humanity,” making “the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government […] one of the most investigated, yet largely ignored persecution of a spiritual-religious group in the 21st century.”  In addition to the joint-statement, a third NGO, Global Human Rights Defence (GHRD), submitted a separate statement to the UN Human Rights Council on May 26, 2023, according to Bitter Winter.  The GHRD statement said, “Too often, the government of the PRC has eluded questions and mocked reports as being mere fantasy. Unfortunately, these reports reflect reality. It is urgent that independent, bipartisan, non-confessional, and non-political investigations are carried out in the PRC to establish the truth. Official statistics produced by the PRC have been questioned by experts many times; it is time to discuss them openly and publicly with international experts. Numbers must be verified, practices must be verified, criminals must be indicted. Forced organ harvesting is a disgrace that the world must not overlook any longer.”  The Bitter Winter article also gave an example of the stories of two Falun Gong practitioners, Ms. Ma Xiuyun and Mr. Tang Pingshun, parents of another Falun Gong practitioner currently residing in Italy.   On August 15, 2023, Katerina Angelakopoulou, President of the Italian Falun Dafa Association, wrote to the head of the Italian government and several ministers. She pleaded: “We turn to you asking for your support toward their release, conveying to the Chinese authorities the respect Italy has for human rights and asking them to stop the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by any democratic country like ours.”  Now, 17 years after the forced organ harvesting was first reported, the crime is still going on in China. While Falun Gong practitioners remain the main target, this practice has been extended to other groups such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. “While the reality of organ predation in the PRC gains growing attention on different media outlets, the victims of these monstrosity are not theoretical. They are real people in flesh and blood.” wrote the Bitter Winter report.
OH 💩💩💩💩💩💩!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
아니 뭐야 둘이 만나? 오리지널이겠지?
Wait.... are we getting something we knew we wanted?!
Netflix needs to do more of this. Fund crazy fun fan concepts, Saitama Vs Goku CMOOOOOON
I hope it's not annimated in the baki verse because if it does, the fight scenes will suck.
HOLY SHIT IT'S ACTUALLY FINALLU HAPPENING BUT AN OFFICIAL FIGHT😭
If it is baki post yujiro fight....    Rip ashura 💀
Ohma in the anime isn’t as developed yet compared to Baki lol hopefully they give him plot armor.
I'm sorry, WHAT!  YO IT'S TIME!
Baki about to woop that ass
AINT NO FKN WAY
guess I gotta check out kengan ashura lol
Baki will win!!!!
Ong?
Wtf Netflix! You have pulled the impossible dreamy match!
Ain’t no fucking way boy…
no way
it'd kinda suck if they used the weakest version of ohma for the fight, but I still think it'd be sick
Machio san: These weaklings 😂
How about ya'll release Kengan Omega. I've been waiting for too long
All them vs edits looking goofy af rn.
Real  question is will it be cgi dawg water ?? Or 2D.
First day waiting for Musashi Miyamoto's arc
Next vs. Saitama
Well since they completely fucked him fighting his dad……
Wtf is going on yoooo
Huh, finally some interesting idea
Its real broi😊😊😊
What the heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, I can't believe this
Steroids
oooomaga
what
Shrek background song name pls
All I am saying is Gayass Baki  better get his shit Rocked!!!
HOLY SHIT CHAT IS THIS REAL
Esto es increíble...
WTF is this real???😮
It obviously ends in a draw, or they decide to become friends and take out a common enemy instead...
Finally been hoping something like this would happen all the way back in highschool 🙏🏽😭😭😭
Jack Hanma- 😑
i saw this on instagram thought it was a meme at first
Bring the flight
Realistically there's no way baki would ever lose this fight but it'll be more fun if they just make them mostly equal in strength
Omg
give us fucking revenge tokyo pls
OFFICIAL DEATH BATTLE??????
YEEEAAAAHH
WHAT TEH FUCK I DD NOT EXPECT THIS
life is good
WHAT??!! Is it april 1st?
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu where are you all along, RIP those who never see this crossover
It’s this real wtf
Guess ima watch kengan ashura now to prepare for this 😮‍💨
o my god🤯
I am ready
*FINALLY OMFG BROOOOO IT'S REAL RAAHHHHHHHH*
No! Fucking! Way!
is this real
I’d rather see this than see Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson 😂
Fights I need to see Yujiro vs kuroki Jack vs raian  Baki vs ohma (of course) Kuroki vs doppo  Wakatsuki vs jack Sen vs retsu
I got Baki to Winn
Bruh How?
No way 😂
WTF!?!
Kengan ashura without shitty cgi?
Yujiro Hanma vs Tatsuyoshi Katsuya tho
Hell yeaahhhh
The two most greatest human fighters clash on a 1 on 1! Will Baki win? FIND OUT ON BVK!
So this is how the world ends
Ok so we all know Baki bodies right?😂
Oh I hope they keep up the pacing format of “do one move, spend a few minutes explaining g that move, do another move, spend a few minutes explaining that one, repeat.” Really keeps you engaged and immersed in the action.
OMG
I prayed for times like this
Please be real
I saw the title and was like “haha nice try you’re not fooling me with this fan trailer” BUT THEN ITS REAL LFGGGG
They better not do bro dirty
wat
I hope they base it offa the street fighter cross over in the manga series typa spin yunno ? Non cannon but a definite what if scenario shoot me down for whatever but hey let’s see it Netflix I’m here for it 🙌🏽😂
Baki: "Sorry but I've got the power of Imagi-" Ohma: "Corrections." ".....Wha-" "CORRECTIONS!" [IRONBREAKER]
Oh man would win zero debate he has more experience his fighting style is accurate compared to a real fighting style he's older stronger and he knows a lot of fighting   Baki he's just a roided out high schooler with no experience no style no specific training and just a little boy that takes a bunch of steroids
Muito obrigado
A Netflix tá demais🎉🎉🎉
Cannon or noncannon
This is insane, let's go ohma!!
Cinema🚬
There is no way this is real
yes please!
imagine seeing them fighting in their current animation style ugle cgi vs slight ugly cgi😂
Yujiro Hanma wins regardless!!!
Netflix really know  how to entertain I can't wait.. maybe they can crossover slam dunk and kuroko no basket  that would be awesome
Thats cool but lets be real baki one shots this guy
I'm actually pretty excited for this NGL

Yujiro comes in and bullies not of them
I’ve been asking for this for so long… LETS GOOOOO
I've been waiting for this moment for 2 years😎👌
one punch man vs one punch man. in the end they don't fight each other, very predictable
Ain't no way!!!
Siempre team Ohma Tokita 🔥❤💪
I choose to believe 🔥
Wait hold up, is this actually going to happen 😮😮😮
OMG what ! KENGAN ASURA MY BOYYY
Akira Toriyama sold his soul to devil for this
Let's  Fucking Gooooo🎉❤
It’s gonna be a good match up
Esse kengan ashura é mais forte que o Picle?
OMG ITS HAPPENING! EVERYONE STAY CALM! STAY FUCKING CALM!
Pndj no dura 5 minutos
Lo que nadie pidio pero siempre quiso soñar con esta pelea. Esta batalla sera EPICA!!
it's happening and it's going to be bloody. Just the way i like it. Go team baki!!!! 💪🏻
BAKİİİİİİ HANMAAAAA WİNNNNNN
I just creamed
OH MY GOSHHHH
Is this a parody account?
Ohma? In 2d!!!
hell yeah!!! Baki Hanma returns!
its a draw
Funny enough, Ohma Tokita vs Baki Hanma was a fight I planned on making a video of. Netflix and the creators of both animes were probably like, "We got you covered fam." then decided to cook with this crossover. I'm definitely looking forward to watching this one.
It doesnt matter who win.  I think it will be draw or something like that, because guys common, its crossover, i dont think that authors give win to one of them, but damn it still very intersting and i dont hype like that very long time, i want to see that now.
Ohma would die with one good punch from Baki. Not the other way around
Netflix has been cooking I see.
W
No way this is actually happening!
Whaaaat
YOOO HOLY SHIT LET'S GOOOOOOO
OMGGGGGGGGG
Cant wait
This is the anime world cup
I just screamed
It's a dream come true
team ohma  👇💪🏻👍
How do we even know it’s real anymore
OH MEN OH BOY OH DAAAAMN
Shame kengan is t further through the anime cause I think current manga tokito would stomp
O.o........so thats why the sky splitted up
spoiler its s draw
Baki win🎉🎉🎉🎉
My money on Baki hands down
Hell yeah
Baki is going to kill Ohma bro
U GUYS ARE ACTUALLY COOKING IM GETTING MY PRESCRIPTION BACK AND BINGE WATCHING BOTH SERIES AGAIN
HOLY.. SHIT!
Is this a joke? Naw no way… Please tell me this is real?!? So real talk. Baki sleeps buddy in 5 seconds right!? Yes i absolutely have watch all of both shows
YEEEEEES FINALLYYYYYYYY
🔥🔥
But prophecy is true! Let's gooooooo
Devil Lance vs Devil Back of Yujiro
Netflix: i do whatever you guys want now
PLEASE LET THE DRAWING STYLE BE FROM KENGAN ASURA!!!
Oh yes im totally making a video on this 🔔🛎 PLEASE REMIND ME IN JUNE 😁
Goosebumps
Which studio is animating this
Sorry I'd win no cap
You make joke of muhammad ali, no wonder this anime is rotten 👎👎
CAAAAARAAAAALHOOOOOOO
It's happening! 😁
I m luffy
Baki  Ashura
No chance for Kengan....😂😂
The animation is still gonna be garbage.
Bruh Baki would destroy that dude all the way.  This isn't a match.
Netflix really are turning up for us fans, thank you so much
Wait is this for real? Can't we like have the rest of season 2 of Kengan Ashura first?
Incroyable
Absolutely no way this is happening LMFAO
Ohma’s gonna need a looooooot of loans in this fight
NOW PUT BAKI ON TEKKEN
No way
Every time I watch Kengen Ashura, all I ever think is how easily Baki would dominate that tournament. You have people who specialize in one primary fighting style, then maybe have a secondary.  Baki, there is no information on how many fighting styles he knows. And, like the Fang in Kengen, Baki can learn someone's fighting style and use it very fast. Like when battling Pickle and using the dinosaur stances... Ohma is talented, but not that talented.
We also need a Naruto vs Ichgo⚡️⚡️⚡️
Thi cant be real. A real crossover.
June 6th huh well let's go then baki for the win for me
If this thing succeeded We will gonna get more and more crossovers
Why does Ohma look different?
With good baki animation, YES!
OH SHIT..........this ain't a joke right?!? This is REAL?!?!? YYYYYOOOOO!!!!!!!!🫨🫨🫨🫨
Owsome!!!
YESSSSSS!!
You got kengen who just through hands 👊😡, and then you got baki who through hands and then goes into intricate detail on the science of punches☝️🤓👊🧐.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I feel for ohma man he’s about to get whooped
Waaaaaaa 🤯🤯🤯
But I think ashura animation is better and it would be better to bring another season of ashura plz
Letsgoo
This is peak
Ogre: Now this is going to be fun  Gensai: You wish
Its annoying that this showdown comes out before season 2 part 2 of the kengan series
Netflix anime department is allergic to taking Ls rn ong
AHFNFNJFJRJTJTJTJFIFIFUFUFUUFUFUJC NO WAY NO WAY THIS SHIT REAL
FINALMENTE ESTA ACONTECENDOO
I prefer kengan
😮
Its gonna be interesting, I loved both series, but I have no doubt that Baki slams. They are gonna have to have some interesting scenarios where the fight is fair or just nerf/buff the characters.
aint no way
Ooh Lawd this is totally insane taking 2 of my favorite anime to fight against each other. Let's go Baki still the best for me.
It's either a draw and a promise to fight a rematch at the end, or they will team up against an enemy and promise to continue their fight in the future.
This feels like a dream
AINT NO FUCKING WAY
They running new seasons simultaneously. If it was a real fight, it would have read: "Naki Hanma vs Ohma Tokita
Thank you
Is it going to be a movie or a full season?
If you are giving this than you need to give us Goku vs Saitama too
Hold the F up! I must be high😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️ But i dont smoke
seems violent 🔥
Someone pinch me
Can't wait for them to fight only to have the fight be interrupted or have the fight be a draw 🙄  These vs. crossovers never have the b4lls to actually decide on a legitimate winner.   Though I'll give props to Godzilla vs. Kong. Because that film at least made a definitive decision on who the winner was.
Honestly I thought they were the same guy back when I first finished all the baki
This might be one of the best things that is happening, can't wait for it to watch ❤
😭😭😭😭😭 thank You so much
Is this real?
Kengan without CGI !  ✨️🙏🏽✨️
Whos gonna make the invisible sandwich this time
Dayum Netflix!!!! Didn’t saw this coming!!!! Supaaa excited for this🎉
Here me out, this will either be an interesting anime, or just bad
Damn, does this mean official goku v superman can be a thing?
IM SO HYPED🔥🔥🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ohhh no no no wait wait is it happening 😮😮😮
Kengan Ashura is a 10/10 manga, Omega unfortunately is kinda mediocre.
Why is everyone so happy about this bout? Just got into Baki, can someone explain?
We got a glimpse of Ohma in the Baki universe. I wonder how Baki will look in the Kengan Ashura Universe.
Baki’s animation helps out with Kengan Ashura
eu te amo, netflix ❤
This is perfect!
How about actually finishing “Kengan Ashura” First! Before you start doing all this other nonsense? Typical Netflix, think they know what people want instead of just Listening to what people have been asking for.🤦‍♂️🤡
I'm telling you now that this fight will end with a tie.
I like both anime . Baki is more unreal in his abilities thou so i think he will win
It’s in Baki style, Baki is winning
Now this will be epic
Why nobody wanted this
spoiler its just gonna end in a draw
This is too hype to mess up... it is impossible to mess this up. Please don't mess this up ❤
Dream comes true
Some useless dreams come true I guess!
We gon need kure vs Jack hanma aswell, this shi gon  e fire as hell 💥💥💥💥
Certeza que sonhei com esse encontro!
Uh how's this gonna work considering the difference in art styles?!?!?!
On the gang baki finna park dude shit
I can't wait for death battle fans to see this lol
What did I do in my lifetime to deserve such a Treat 😢
So is ohma gonna get buffed or is baki getting nerfed
Yujiroooo😂
It's was unexpected
Netflix give us another season of Ajin!!
Pls don’t make it like they don’t end the fight properly but instead fight a common enemy.
Wow, dream come true!
Please god use real animation and do not use CGI. I absolutely hate CGI anime.
Anyone object about throwing Akuma into the mix ?
WHAAAATTT??????????
I want to see anorher season of baki
Kengan ashura wins for sure
No way
I don't understand why it's not called Baki Vs Ohma. I love both there both in my top 3 anime honestly, it's gonna be a hard but exciting watch lol. Surely Baki is gonna win?
Yoo, is that really happening, or it's a fake account/ Fan edit
No way
Can't wait until pickle son is born👹👹👹
Baki would literally kill this guy Bffr
I still don’t believe it
Giga Chad VS Giga Chad.
Man no fucking way!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Overheat!!
BAKI WIN, HE GOT THE ZOOMIES
We got BAKI vs KENGAN now i cant help but feel like we got a luffy vs Naruto down the line 😂
Cool.
I do not think i have ever been so hyped for a collab ever
I hope they go more towards Kengan artstyle. It has far better aesthetic
Yujiro enters in arena and b*tch slap both of them.
NO FUCKING WAY
Oh in last seconds it seems using baki animation graphic than kengan ashura, which i was hoping better use kengan ashura graphic than baki, because i like motion capture for fighting in kengan ashura than in Baki. Its so fluid, and enjoyable than baki, doesn't mean im not enjoying in Baki fighting.
Aint no fucking way 🔥
this like tekkan vs street fighter
Kengan Ashura😭❤️
baki slams
Too good to be true netflix has been hacked by isis or something.
Netflix forget about all of the shit ive talked about you before 😂
Gtfoh! This is awesome! Never thought in a million years they'd do this lol can't wait to see it!
Best bday gift ever.
YOOOOO
Damn they trying to beat out the Jake Paul VS Mike Tyson fight with this one
Before anyone starts: Yes Baki solos Kengan so CAN WE NOW ENJOY THE SHOW?
Baki winning
Fake news 😂
The world didn't ask for this 😂. Tokita is getting cooked by baki
Kengan looks better in 2D.
What used to be a Dream is now about to come true.
This gotta be a joke
Just give us the god of sumo and miyamoto arcs
Une dinguerie
Baki vs Ohma……vs ……Makanoichi????????
Oh nah
Let's go 6 days from my birthday.

Is this REAL !?
But they haven't even wrapped up Kengan Ashuru yet though ?!?
love it baki have to win this
What if Baki vs predator
This is gonna go so hard
It would be more cool of they had fight scenes like kenga ashura
How about just new seasons of both thanks
Oohhh!
It seems it is gonna be about only Ohma vs Baki
Enserio? Le atinaste Netflix
Woh woh ...juz unbelievable
The legend is coming
I wonder who they are gonna team up to fight.
Let's Go Baki San!
NO FREAKING WAY WHATTTT
Ohma: How....how the hell did I get here...
WHAT THE HELLL WHAT WWWWWWWWW
Baki should win with one finger!😂
Cosmo Imai vs Dopo Orochi
THIS WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT TECHNICALLY HOW MANY DUMBELLS YOU CAN LIFT IS ALSO CANON TO BAKI
For real?! Power scalers are about to have a field day with this.
Get the freak outta here! Everything in my life will come to complete halt the moment this releases.
Que bueno que lo va a hacer al estilo de animación de Baki y no al revés, porque el otro con su animación de CGI no me gusta tanto.
Im blurrrr😲
I didnt watch Kengan ashura yet, i only watched baki so can anyone tell me who is stronger?
Is this real? No way this is real!
wow this will be a legendary battle    ...
Yuijiro vs Kuroki Julius or Wakatsuki vs Jack Raian or Kanoh vs Someone idk maybe Pickle
Y'all gotta nerf baki, he went toe to toe with the ogre.
ME VA A DAR UN ORGASMO VISUAL Y SEXUAL POR ESTO 💖💖💖💖
Meh. Barely anyone will watch but comment sections ignite 😂
Invisible food. Its what its all about.
Tokita Ohma in good animation, am i dreaming or what
They will have to nerf Baki a LOT to come down to Ohma level. This is gonna be such a cringe movie...
Holy Moly
This wild bruh like no cap! Netflix on their shit!
Damn ❤❤
What the shit!! is this real?🥶
Woah
筋肉のオールスター感謝祭
BAKI!💪🏻
Oh nah this gone be epic
Im so hyped for this shit
Man its unfair, just a big money grab i guess
Both creators of the manga are like " Sure, we'll do a Mashup movie. Just as long as my guy wins"
Nah... i wanna watch yujiro vs connector. 😂
Interesting
世紀のバトル
Bakis gonna win unless they equalize the verses
Boooooooooooo everyone don't like this garbage that would suck there not even based on same story make it where they have to finish with new seasons think for one sec  the movie of kengan ashora has a good story line this garbage will ruin the wholr anime and if u guys really do watch anime and understand it u wouldn't be liking this garbage
holly sh1t
I don't know about kengen, but Baki ain't nothing to play with LoL
Je vous déteste merci !
This is not fucking real
Are ye guys waited for it on Death Battle channel too?
the connector vs yujiro
Well done netflix
No way
Im so hyped i can't wait thank you netflix you just made my birthday much better ❤🎉
Baki one shots
Bros cooking
Netflix: *Guess who'll become black*
who th is ohma the guy? is he from an anime?
*F Ohma*
Ow...hell yeah🔥🔥
Spoiler: Honestly hoping that this happens after Ohma gets a heart transplant because his body was a wreck while he had his old one.
Whoever wins isn’t the big deal here, it’s the fact that a VS is actually happening Officially 🙏😭 Hoping to see more VS battles in the future
No fukin way it’s actually Real 😂 🙏 THIS THE KIND OF SHT IM TRYNA SEEEE
I want see Yugiro Hanma fight against Someone from another animes Like Hunter X Hunter,Naruto Classic,Boku no Hero Academia,Jojo Because l kind tired too see Yujiro fighting against opponents weak the Him l never him Fighting with someone the same level our above him he  Always Wins that Funny anymore.
This can’t be real , is this a dream guys 😭
"P E A K"  🗣️ 🔥🔥🔥
I don't give a shit who wins this is going to be fucking awesome
Y’ALL SMELL THAT??? SOMEONES COOKING😈
Yo chat is this real??
Omggg
Baki negs.
"Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura" makes me feel like there is a person who is called Kengan
Oh yeah!!!!
I never expect two anime collabs or has it been done before?
Huh
Thank you Netflix you ROCK🤘🏾
O baki contra todo o universo de kenga ashura?? Ou.. baki VS oma?
Ohh wow, cant belive it!!! Its gonna be an amazing fight, but if things are done as they should, Baki would absolutely destroy Ohma.
That is crazy. I was thinking about this when I finished watching and reading Baki months ago 😂👍🏾  Now this came true.
Let’s gooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
LET'S GO 🔥
LETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO BEST COLAB
NOOOOOO WAYYYYY
this is not real
Yo Netflix, take my money 🤑💰 thanks for the Collab
lolwuttt
1 day after my birthday Good gift Netflix
Damn, just when I was about to cancel Netflix!!!!!!!
I mean, Baki wins this hands down, he will ruin Kengan, why is this even a thing ...?
fighting anime wet dream
Damn you Netflix! Just when I was thinking about cancelling you. I get gut punched!!! 😤
GOATED
When is Baki DOU
All this means is that asura get better animation. Not 3d trash
To be honest I'm not hype about this, are they gonna nerf Baki or buff Kengan or just keep them the same.
No way
Netflix Anime acually GOATED
Thank you netflix for another banger
Ohma and baki for tekken 8
Like what the actual fuuuuuqqq! Bruv! We truly live in a society where dreams are possible
Oh shit, its actually happening
He picked the right one, because he don't want one second of demon back!
I like Ohma but Baki would win.
oliva vs kaolan. quick.
Where does this happen ?
Wow, I never expected this. I kind of wish Baki was in the Kengan world, would be dope to see a 3d model of Baki, but seeing the MC from Kengan in normal anime style is even better.
Holy popsicles. This will be Epic!
Eagerly waiting.........,❤
omg this could be really cool if they do it right
Meu Deus será verdadeiro tomara que seja verdade irmão poxa já tou animado
What about lookism season 2 ❤❤❤
FINALLLLYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FFFFFUUUUUCCKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA! TEAM OHMA!
Wow is this for real? Keep the arena fighting going.
baki gon give him work
Ok, give whoever is running Netflix anime a raise.
Knowing netflix its definitely gonna be a draw
Why don’t you release a season instead no one cares about this or asked
❤❤❤❤
Я считаю, что все персонажи из кенгана не смогут конкурировать с пуленепробиваемыми шизиками... А САМОЕ ГЛАВНОЕ, ЛУЧШЕ БЫ ПРОДОЛЖЕНИЕ КЕНГАНА ВЫПУСТИЛИ, А НЕ ДОБАВЛЯТЬ УЖЕ ФАНФИК НА НЕЗАКОНЧЕННОЕ ПРОИЗВЕДЕНИЕ, это бред.
Oh hell nah, this would be insane !
finally we will get to see tokita in animation other than cgi , and supper excited
This is funny because I never watched Baki because of Kengan Asura 😂
fight in 3d please, rather than choppy 2d slideshow
I can die happy now.
Im so goddamm exited
BAKI WINS THIS ALLL DAYYYYYYY
Bro i think yuichiro hanma well be here because yuichiro hanma is the most mysterious character in Baki if he in baki hanma vs kengan ashura it well be like dis 👹🗿💪🦾
This anime is VERY boring.
This is gonna be a so hype!
i love kengan more than baki but sadly Ohma isn't on Baki's level yet but if somehow Ohma wins this fight i'll be convinced he had plot armor
NO WAYYYYYY BROOO
Finally A worthy opponent , our battle will be legendary 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yessir I got my money on ohma
And next movie Baki and Ohma will be invited to fight in Record of Ragnarok
Just don't get Yujiro involved. Might be somewhat fair
Lookism session 2
Baki wins this sadly.. we haven't seen much of Ohma's potential
this will be really epic...
😳😳
Wtf
Baki would absolutely obliterate him
Oh no they gonna kill off Ohma
Superb!!!
Big W for netflix anime
Ohma wins He is much stronger than baki his techinques skills and speed he got everything to win
yis haha lits gu
Last Man Standing
You know they gonna end up being on da same team against those death row inmates😁
Gave me the excitement like snk vs capcom 27 years ago
Baki will win 🔥🔥
Sick
한마 바키랑 아슈라 ㅋㅋㅋ shit !!!!!!
this cum bucket worthy
fragmanı ve müziği 100 lerce kez izleyip dinleyenler
Wtf
Both anime have different quality of anime, I'm excited to see their quality adjustment
Ayooooo😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Bro I thought it was fake when I saw the notifications for it wtf 👏😭
Yeaaaaa let’s go
Gensai meeting yujiro would be a sight
Dream come true
Cool, can't wait
Although I personally prefer Kengan Ashura 100 times more than Baki, but I am as excited for this Movie as I am for Part 2 of Season 2 of Kengan Ashura.
🔥🔥🔥🔥💀🔥🔥🔥🔥
Asure is not real fighter like Baki hanma. Story line Baki comfirm Better than Asure. Asure just fight without good story.  And Baki start from small already training,no superpower or magic, pure strength and kung fu
Omggggg this is freaking real i thought it was cap
Noooo way wtf yeah bruh yeah
Just wow...oh man wow...
As long as it's animated. Good call.
let's go. Kinda weird to see Tokita Ohma in 2d animation style but can't wait
Netflix I want a fight between yujiro hanma and the strongest villain of kangen Ashura...plz 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ohma in his verse is a weak fighter compared to baki but when they both are in the same show then there is a chance he will get a strength boost to make it more entertaining
I’m sorry but I don’t think my boy Baki stands a chances against Ohma
Baki is way strongetr but ilove th e fights in kengan than baki 😂... All talk and talk.. And no descent fight
I have watched both anime but i think its unbalanced.. this is like dragonball vs naruto
Team baki were you at
جالب به نظر میاد
Thank god it is in Bakis style and not the eye sore of kengan
Cool I can't wait to see this
May God have mercy on any Kengan Ashura character who thinks they can take Yujiro.
I am Excited man ❤
This is dumb. Baki outclasses them in every area......
Mismatch. Baki has a dude who fought whole ass dinosaurs. Yujiro can tank and react to lightning with no damage. They throw punches that break the sound barrier. The list goes on.
Dreams do come true 😢
Worth just to see tokita animated probably instead of the cgi trash that doesnt even look like its him most of the time
What!! Who is he the next arc that should be about musahsi miyamoto isn't
대박 아슈라 돌아왔구나
Knowing Baki he’s gonna lose
NO MAMEEEEEEEEEEEES VETE ALV ESTOY CHILLANDO AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Plz no draw bullshit
Baki would wipe the floor with Kengan.
If Yujiro was there......
Isnt kinda early? Ohma is nowhere near Baki level
Finally 2d kengan asura
Aint no wayyy
one of my dream has finally coming true. How about also crossing over between Kuroko no basket and Slamd Dunk? I believe KnB X SD will go down in anime history.
0_0
I expected that when they made this crossover it would laugh like in the manga, Orochi doppo vs pa peing, but this is much better
Baki solos Kengan Ashura verse
Can we get Kengan Omega first 🤷🏾‍♂️
O dayz its finally here ive been waiting its gonna b so hype
I like the idea but kengan Ashura is so much better anime for me, meanwhile Baki 😒😒
Grettings to Netflix They fucking cooked🔥🔥
i think will tie 🤣like both of thm get tired
Who going to win?? I got Baki
Yoooooooo What??? Crossover  Best thing I’ve seen🎉🎉🎉🎉
MAN I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.
Whaaaaaat!?
Crazy
This is going to be the best anime battle ever 🤩🤯
Here's the thing though. Baki can't lose. Baking has to win this to pose a threat to his pops. I guess a cool twist would be Baki loses and Yujiro catches wind of this powerful fighter who defeats his son. Interesting.
Baki 2D style  BUT with Kengans fast paced fighting animation  will make this perfect
Plz make em friends at the end, they too chill to acctualy kill each other.
Bruh we getting baki and ashura crossover before gta 6
This can’t be real… I’ll wait and see.
Baki no diff but Will be very interesting to watch
please Netflix bring Spanish dub of walking dead in Netflix 🙏
wow, now that's an awesome surprise, and it comes out on my birthday! :3 I really hope they understand how much hype is on this and live up to it.
And after this the main event; The Fang of Metsudo vs Yujiro Hanma
It's great. But I want animation style like KENGAN ASHURA.
Idk how strong ohman is in the manga, but if this fight gonna be base of the anime then baki wins.  NETFLIX TAKING AN ADVANCE WITH THIS ON🗣️🗣️🗣️
Universe fight 🔥
baki will dogwalk omah ngl
nah 100% Baki won frfr
Baki is gonna win
I want to see this fight in Kenshin association art style
Wait what is this real
Cracaaa eu esperava isso por anos
Took long enough
What the Flip 😵‍💫
fuck jake paul vs tyson this is IT
As long as it doesnt end up a draw on some bs . Everytime they do verses movies it ends a draw and they end up working together on some bs i hate it sooo much 😅
TU NO METE CABRAS SARAMANBICHE
I would imagine them having a draw then Yujiro shows up and kicks both their asses. lol
YOOOOOO
You know they're going to go all out
Baki wins easily
Ohma in 2D looks a lil off 😭
This fight better take at least 4 episodes.take note from old dbz on this one
Always on preferred Asura to Baki, but this crossover gonna be sick
This is fake right? I mean I hope it's not thatd be awesome! I'm a fan of both so good!
And in true Japanese fashion, it'll be a draw.
Cuando ponen la cancion de afeitate la tota o la ocacion
YEEEEEEEEEE
OMFG!
Just like UFC vs OneFC
Hell yeahhh!! ✊️✊️
The strongest schooler?? Isn't he supposed to be the Strongest Creature rn since he defeated Yujiro already?
Mandaram a braba agora
Netflix finally made one for fans of these iconic animes
I am supporting the underdog Ohma for the win.
Reallllllyyyyyyyy ??????????😁
Here for it!! Someone at Netflix is paying attention. Let's get it on!
Never in my wildest dreams have i thought that this was gonna happen... This is about to wild boys, get ready
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA esto es mucho es muy epico
whhhaat for real
I just thought... What If Netflix added the Mishima Family in the Crossover? 🤔
QUE ES ESTA PUTA LOCURA
Yuiro Hanma go and win all 💪
Demon Back vs The Advance If this is both their current forms (Baki post his Yujiro fight and Ohma after his Omega arch) They this is going to be amazing
Awesome sauce! Epic collab
They are basically the same character 😂👍🏻
Not official enough for me yet to believe it
I would see Ali jr vs Gaolang Wongsawat
Idc who wins i just wanna watch two goats fight 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Iam for team Hanma
Someone tell me I'm actually dreaming. It's actually gonna happen? Really really?
Guaranteed yujiroh comes in as a boss fight. just like he did when baki fought hanayama
This isnt even a fair fight, ohma destroys baki
W.
Spoiler, they tie somehow
You son of a bitch. Im in
Wait....im not dreaming....
Baki wins.....easy.
Epicest Battle ahead
Wait, is this real?!?!?
STAY CALM! STAY FUCKING CALM!! Ya'll really think Yujiro will let Baki have all the fun?
Kiichi Miyazawa Vs Baki Hanma would've been a better match up. Tough Manga is so underrated.  Then Ohma Tokita Vs Ken Kitano.
Baki gon win
É óbvio que Baki será mercado galera ksksksks
we must be trippin yall
Lol
🗿🚬
It will be the biggest battle of 2024
baki low difss him doesn't even need back or demon brain
Love them both, but i think Baki is taking this home. We havent seen the full extent of Ohma's power. But we have seen Baki do the most super human shit you can imagine.
Nah make it a plot armor battle Yujiro vs Shen Wulong. Kengan Omega readers know
Greatest crossover in all of anime.
I mean Baki is 100 percent winning but let’s cheer ohma on
Still waiting on Devil May Cry.
Nahh that’s insane  I’m excited for this 😆
Bro, if Netflix gets their hands on Hajime No Ippo. Lots of Potential.  We finally get the Big Three of Martial Arts Anime.
Team Hanma 👇🏿
LETS GOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit
This is going to be ultimate
Baki would absolutely destroy him and it's not close.
TEAM BAKI ALL THE WAY...i respect kengan but baki clears as a fighter and character
I need a minute.
So baki and kangan ashura crossover
¡Debo estar soñando! 🥲
baki, don't hurt him
Yujiro vs the Connector would be good to see
Is this real
So is Hibiki Sakura also canon in Baki universe?
Welp, I can't possibly pick only one side, I love both these series.
Yujiro: Nah id win  Shen Wu Long: 😅 well lets try
They didn’t even finish kengan. Or am I missing something
Oh nah they fr did tokita vs baki shock
That's wassup.  TEAM BAKI OVER HERE LOL
I can't believe this is actually happening, I CAN'T WAIT!!!
BbMMB a day bs
Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex Say Gex
Insane!!!!
Oh snap!!!
So yall just going to make a collab instead making a season 2 for kengan ashura? its been like what 2020 and now its 2024
Bro no way
LETS GOOOOO
Wait WTF
Dam it y'all making me resubscribe after unsubscribing? I got you guys. 😆🐵🍿
I was waiting for Death Battle to do this fight. They never did so I guess Netflix said "fine, Ill do it myself"
Can't believe this Is actually happening
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Baki gonna win im calling it
I thought this was a fan channel doing fake teasers lol
As much as I love Kengan Ashura, that show is basically a morr "grounded" version of Baki.
I’m rooting for Ohma cause I like his show better
KHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Como dice el pinguino poético de la mini serie Vete a la versh: "Ooouuuh, yyyyyeeeaaah ..."
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is this actually real?!
LETS GOOOO!! 🔥🔥🔥
Netflix W?
I’ll believe it when I see it 😅
Nani 😮🔥🔥👍
Endorphin vs Advance 🔥
Se viene mucho cine
Ok Netflix I see you
i hope they have  side fights like: jack hanama vs takeshi wakastuki yujiro hanma vs kuroki gensai doppo orochi vs adam dudley hanayam vs jun sekibayashi  that would be beast as well
Woah woah woah woah hey HEY HEY HEY HEY
Wait ao this is coming before kengen ashura season 2 part 2?  If ohma loses he will be overshadowed
Baki low diff i'm afraid 🖐😏🤚
So there going to bring Kengan into Baki’s verse, if so it’s a default win for Baki, but I think it’s going to end in a draw I have a feeling
OMG İS THİS A DREAM?
I feel like they could have done kengans models hair a bit better but hey not gonna complain, just hope the actual fight animation is amazing.
Holy shit lol - I stopped watching both of these shows, but i have a love for both characters, and i'm 1000% watching this
Wao!
Ffdeeddffggfre ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Ohma: using Niko style Baki: using 8000 years old chinesse technique called one inch testicular punch
Baki wins easily
what the hell??? Now i have to catch up on kengan ashura. Very glad its in baki style.
Damn, i wonder hoe they are gonna buff kengan chars, or... I just hope its the secondary chars fights, even then baki chars have a shit more of no sense than the "real" kengan
Ok ok bet! But I thought we were going to see miyomoto musashi fight the whole Baki universe 😅
ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME !!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO !!! (FART) OOOOOOOOOOO ! .....sorry got way too excited I ... you know 😅😅😅
But the dub for ohma is retsu dub
I'm so close to quitting the entire baki series and it's because of the fans who cares if he's stronger than ohma enjoy the fuckin movie damn not everything is about power scaling when it comes to anime
His name is Ohma Tokita
Oh snaps !!!
This is gonna be so awesome but I would like the to the whole cast from both shows going at it. That would be INSANE
Em um cenário multifacetado de dualidade cósmica, onde a fulgência da aurora encontra a penumbra crepuscular, despontam dois jovens como sentinelas de uma busca incessante pela transcendência, cada qual enredado nas intricadas teias do destino e da determinação. Um, imerso nas profundezas dos golpes de seu pai tirano, anseia pela maestria das técnicas ancestrais das artes marciais, trilhando os caminhos árduos da disciplina e da superação para desvendar os segredos do corpo e da mente, e encontrar na forja do combate a redenção para suas cicatrizes emocionais. Enquanto isso, o outro, envolto nas sombras da desventura e da adversidade, almeja aprimorar-se nas artes marciais mais refinadas, mergulhando nos recônditos obscuros da sua própria alma em busca da transcendência, buscando dominar os movimentos fluidos e precisos que transcendem os limites do físico, e assim se erguer como um avatar da força implacável, um mestre das técnicas milenares que conduzem à iluminação através da luta.
Holy crap I thought people were memeing
Ohmas getting clapped wtff
Damn, never thought that my dream actually comes true, I-... **screaming in happiness**
ITSSSSS HAPPPPPPENIGJGJG GJGNBVNFNFNNDHF
WHAAAAAAAAAT
kuraki>yujiro
Okay , but we want fighting scenes like kengan animation please🙏
YESSIR
The prayers have been awnsered
Aí sim Netflix! Da até vontade de voltar a assinar teu streaming de novo com esse anúncio.
Not seen anything from Netflix themselves. So will await that reveal. But tbh. Would prefer to focus on Jack Hanma beating Pickle.
Rip Kengen
So, this is what Ohma looks like in 2d 😹😹😹
Baki : *copy nico style Ohma : nuh uh
Yujiro : oh brother these guys stink
just woke up and saw the teaser fckn great\000
I can't believe this isn't fan made, this is really happening??
I’m the toilet sitting minding my business scrolling and I screamed of excitement
Team baki all the way
El Godzilla vs Kong del anime
NO FUCKING WAY WHAT THE FUCK
Pero que ven mis oídos mano
oh yeeeah baby time motivation
Baki neg diff 💀
What?!?!?!
Honestly, kengan ashura is so much better. Baki Hanma is just one big attack after another. Not much actual fighting scenes. Attack, dialogue, attack, dialogue, and onward. Kengan ashura shows straight up fights. And various ones. Artwork looks weird at first, but in the fight scenes, it fits so well.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I CAN’T WAIT TILL JUNE 6, I’M REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS CROSSOVER FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yoooooooooooooo
Kengan Ashura wants to taste Defeat 🔥
Finally!
Oh god im gonna cum
aw bro don't make it in the goofy trash baki style... I only like kengan ashura because it's realistic
im very curious who will fight with  Agyto
Well atleast isnt that shit cgi
What the fuck LMAO
I mean, either Baki characters will get nerfed, or Kengan characters will get buffed. I hope the latter happens and everyone goes crazy.
bro thsi is goanna be so cool . all amsters from baki fights the kengan association :kuroki vs youjiro , ohma vs bak , raiana vs jack , hatsumi vs shibukawa , youchiro x hayami masaki / meguro masaki , and more this is goanna be legendary
AIN'T NO WAYYYYYYYY
Now then, I'm rooting for Baki.
More mid
I’m so hype! But there’s no denying that Baki will come out victorious!
realistically Ohma don’t got shit for Baki😂😂
the real winners of this is "US"
Wtf is going on?
Nahhhh some of the strongest human only fighters going toe to toe. I am there for that.
Yujiro can't wait to play with Fang of Metsuda
No way, what ??
🧌 rad
As much as I love Kengan Ashura, Baki & Yujiro would solo them.
Well they actually doing a crossover that's very rare for anime to do it
I like both anime, but I think Baki takes it.
wut
Kengan Ashura  all day
HOLY SHIT
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!
No pelean , en el manga queda inconcluso
That’s hype, I didn’t expect this but now I want to see it happen so much now lol
Well it's in the baki animation so it's already a clear winner....but honestly I'm not into the baki animation because the fights are very slow paced unlike Kengan Ashura....which is why I would prefer it to be in the Kengan Ashura style animation...
Baki would win mid diff
Finall6😊
AINT NO WAY 🔥🔥🔥
🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿baki, but I still love the show 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
AHHHHHHHHHHH OH MY FUCKING GOD OH MY GOD🗣️🔥💯💯💯 I CAN N O T WAIT FOR THISSSSSSSSSSS
How far are you gonna nerf Baki for this fight to be fair.
Quero ver yujiro vs conector
Where the fuck is season 4 Netflix
Awesome!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Doesnt Baki wipe 🤔
What a time to be freaking alive! 😱😱😱😱
Somebody call Harada sensei, these two need to be in Tekken!
Please use Baki animation instead of Kengan CGI garbage
it was talk bout in 2020 about acrosser and Will we finally getting Kengan ashura vs baking yes I've waiting for this since 2019 f baki kengan all the way let go and can't wait for Kengan season 2 part 2
"Dime que no te gusta la animación de Kengan... sin decirme que no te gusta la animación de Kengan"  Netflix: Crossover épico... pero con animación de Baki papa
FINALLY
Aaight Netflix, take your W.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
For real 😱 😊
Sinistro💀🔥👊
WHAAAAT?!!!!
I can't wait for this
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who won in the manga
2D Ohma isn't real he can't hurt you
Kengan’s fucked
Can't wait for this one
Yessssss
😮😮Dude....
Ohma gets bullies but kengan I'd a a better show
It's like Goku vs Krillin but I'm still excited!
Team Ohma ♡
YOOO NOO WAYYY LESSS GOO
Netflix said this time, I would do it myself.
if we got a luffy vs naruto one the anime world would be in shambles
This is will a battle for the ages.
Dumb
Now this is a shocking crossover!  Didn't think this would happen!!!
Wait what 😱😱
On my birthday lets goo
Way too close to April first
I hope that it will be animated by kengan animators cuz baki's fights r so fucking boring
How on earth this going to be
psychologist: baki vs kengan doesn't exist, it can't hurt you. me : hurt me? IT'S FRIGGIN HEAVEN.
Bro Gensai Kuroki vs Doppo Orochi🥶🥶
This is dope but my money goes to Baki.
Wait for real?!
mfs animating side stories instead of the main shows
Ohma >
Not even close, even this watered] down version of Baki could scrap Ohma. Netflix if you're going to do Baki, do it all; and do it right. This is as lame as Tyson vs Paul, the only way Mike doesn't kill him is if they plan something. I know plenty of 5 0and up real martial artist that train everyday and still put 20 yr old athletes in their place.
I literally have always said this would be a dope ass crossover and now it’s coming out on my birthday so you’re welcome
Sickk
Nem fudendo que eles vão colidir
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 🔥
Thank you God, obrigado meu deus!!🇧🇷🇧🇷
I think that baki is to good after he fight with his dad
1and only baki ❤
why u gotta tease me like that
Oh shit 🤣🤣no way
Kengan  Ashura for me is better then Baki.   That whole Ali arc was a waste of fucking time and poor writing.
WHAT
Wow!
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
why hahah? so cool!
lets fking goooooooooooooooooooo
I'm rooting for everything KENGAN ASHURA!
👀👀👀👀
I'm team Ohma. Let's gooo!
On which mang is based guys? Coz i dont think baki versus kengan manga officially writen so this is originally Netflix fan service?
I don't understand why they decided to go back to 3d animation in fight scenes because they stopped doing it in the other seasons when they realised it looks bad
they gonna nerf the hell outa Baki
Ohma no está tan fuerte en el anime aún como lo está en el manga, en cambio Baki si ya está en un muy bien nivel en el anime, Baki tiene más capítulos en Netflix seria injusto si es el Ohma del anime nada más
getting this before the last part of kengan ashura lmao
Yeahhhhhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟 I can't wait to see it
obrigado deus
Esto es masacre
It's veeeeery weird to see Ohma in 2d
I hope there's plenty of fights other than Baki and Ohma, I'd particularly love to see Yujiro fight Agito, or Cosmo vs Katsumi
Someone slap my face… I’m dreaming
OHHHH SHIT!! LET'S FUCKIN GO MY BOY OHMA!!!
Where is kengen ashura season 2
Okay, this took me by surprised
Team kengan.
This feels like a cash grab  😂😂😂
Omg I can't wait for this!!!!
Wait a damn minute 😭
This fight is too one sided
Rip kengan ashura
Wait what????? How???
this anime is still going on?? i thought thta oger vs baki was the finally 💀
QUE ESTAN HABLADO  POTASUMAREEEE COMO VAN A ROMPER EL INTERNET ASI 😧😧😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Holy shit, Not gonna lie I thought this shit was an early April fools at first I guess I was wrong😂
Don't you dare give me false hope
Baki soloes.
Ain't no way
I got my money on tokita! The niko style!
The time netflix cooked 🎉
I was waiting since 2019.😈
Brutal 👏👏👏👏👏👏The Best🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IMMA WHIP IT OU-
estos se fumaron un porro
This is actually happening :) thought I read the title wrong. Who do you all prefer Baki or Kengan ?
Kensain Acura sucks Baki will win
Ah, the original vs the copy. Cant wait!
Ohma in the baki animation style
BROOOO THERES NO FUCKIN WAY
wtf, yo is this real....immma looose my mind
I big part of me says Baki is going to win but I’m still going for ohma
No. Yo quiero ver mas del manga de kengan animado, no Baki.
Bro I'm geeking the fuck OUT
YOOOO THIS IS SICKKKK ...
うお！
Thank god it’s in Baki animation I can’t stand that 10fps bs😂
AND KENGAN ASHURA SSEASON 3? When????
OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH MMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GGGGOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD
wtf
God its so baseeeeed. I wish Kengan ashura had a baki crossover in the manga(maybe it did and im forgetting) i just remember the street fighter one
Te ponen imágenes del anime kengan ashura entre medio de la bosta de animacion que va a ser la peli. Es como que te vayas a comer un pancho rancio frente a la plaza y te ponen un poster de un asado a la estaca para que nonte parezca tan desabrida la comida calculo😂😂😂
é melhor realmente os 2 serem 2d, pq um 2d e outro cgi na mesma tela fica meioe stranho
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Bisasam
WTF!!!! Yessssssssssss
And this is a while away too! They cooking!
Forget Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul!The real fight of the century is going to be this one!!!!!!
wow I'm excited now my god I'm finally going to watch the battle between two fighting demons will arrive thank you Netflix you're doing an incredible  🎉
Bno el Baki actual si se carga facilmente al Ohma pero bno talvez sea un Baki nerfeado o no se 😢😢😢
Are we dreaming?!How the hell did something like this come in reality?!😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨
Looking like the baki animation, but they could switch back and forth.
いややばすぎ激アツだろ 語彙力さえ吹き飛んだわ
Baki : one punch  Kengan : ☠️☠️☠️
This is gunna be amazing
Wait so this is real? I made a joke about "who would win in a fight" the other day..! LETS GO. IM SO READY FOR NIKO STYLE TO TAKE TOKYO BY STORM
baki all the way
Omg
Now THAT was awesome
Been waiting for like almost 2 yrs  😅😅. I'm so happy to see this soon
CHAT IS THIS REAL CHAT?!?!
This is insane actually a huge w by netflix
xdd we all said as a joke. Can't believe they really make this shit happen.
am I the only one who is waiting for Kengan vs Purgatory ?? Alan Wu vs. Kure Raian !! seems like a long road ahead 😔
april fools aint till next week
Thank you for bringing it, Love you Netflix❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
YOURE LYING
NO FUCKING WAAAAAY
Holy.. shit
Baki ez wonn🦖
BAKI IS SO HOT
ITS TIME FOR A DEATH BATTLE!!!!!!!!
ok
"So... you wanna fight too?"
Finally man, cant wait to see it.
Baki wins if not ohma finna get a buff
Hello I am.the living model for Omah
The best question Is !   Are both of them same Universe ?   We all know baki verse Is really OP martial art specialy in JAPAN 😂
baki murders ohma anyone who reads both mangas knows this fight really shouldn’t even be close wish they’d wait for kengan omega to finish so ohma can get stronger but since it’s here I’m sure it’ll be great I just know they either gonna nerf baki or give ohma plot armor lol
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮this is a joke right?
No fucking way
So are gonna show u gonna win this time or cut it like in that short chapter?
It will be funny to hear Ohma speaking with retsu's voice because both characters have the same voice actor 🤣
YES
Lol
No fucking way.
This made my freaking day. As a huge fan of both series, I can tell this is gonna be amazing.
Amazing job Netflix its kinda cursed seeing Ohma in 2D
It’s on my birthday
If Ohma starts saying “You were awesome Baki” we all know what is coming next 😂😂
Seriously?!
I really hope they didn't put yujiro in this because he would probably jump ALL OF THEM in most of the fight
Baki vs ohma and Yujiro Hanma vs shen wulong.....daaaaaaaaaaaammmnnn🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
lol they gonna have to nerf Baki so hard to make this a remotely fair fight
There is no way baki can beat ohma. Ohma is way advance in fighting.
oh wtfffff lets gooo
Tá maluco, Baki sola
The Underground Arena vs. Kengan Annihilation Tournament
Imagine if they made all of Kengan Ashura’s crossover manga like Kengan Ashura X Street Fighter. If this crossover is possible then I pray for another one
Wait, this is real??? I thought it was something like a pre-aprils fools!!!!
Hindi main ayega?
HOLY FUCK
Thank you netflix
Yujiro Enters 😈😈 Entire Kengan fanbase 🥶🥶
...?
Yujiro vs who is their strongest?
NO WAY!!! Yessssssss!...... Team Baki here, his battle genius and demon brain beats Ohma's demon Niko style techniques IMO.
Just so you know, we haven’t seen Baki go all out since Baki vs Yujiro which was back in 2008! And he’s gotten much stronger since then and that’s without the Demon Back activated so imagine when he finally activates it again and goes all out!
Legggggggggoooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Are u fucking with me? Don't do this please
3D vs 2D 💀
I love both shows but I can just see Baki being impressed with Ohma and just toying with him lol.
Epic showdown coming in June😮 I think the Baki characters have the edge from feats alone, but the fights will probably be very close.
Baki will win and admit that Ohma is capable of defeating him.
Now is time for DEATH BATTLE
:000
Yeah I’m 10000% going to see this my money is on Baki
Noooo way it's actually happening 👀👀👀👀👀
the rock vs john cena
NO FUCKING WAY😯
YES!
this is much better fight than loganvsksi and jakevstyson
Yo this is going to be the fight of all fights hell yez bring it on
I’ve never been more excited to watch two animated full grown men punch each other in the face.
Esto va a ser espectacular
This is canon right?? 😊
哇操，認真？！
LMAO what the hell ! bring saitama vs goku lmao
Baki lose because invisible food
Powerscalers gona be heated with this no matter how it plays out and I can’t wait to see that
The closest thing to peak crossovers like this was jimmy newton vs Timmy turners
death
waiting one of them at Tekken 8 guest characters
This literally comes out on my birthday 😮
i love baki <3
This meeting of eyes says a lot, "you're strong", I've been waiting for this for years and now I'll be able to see ohma and baki in action
THIS... CAN'T BE.. TRUE 😢❤
Damn a crossover?
So, it's not about strength        It's about skills and experience
lets go lets gooooo
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, VAMOOOOOIIOIOOOOOSSSS
I pray to see Jack vs Raian!!!
I might sub back to Netflix just for this.
The main character for Kengan isn't that strong. There's another fighting anime called "Legend of the Fighting Wolves" and it is bad a$$!!!  The main character in that story would destroy Kengan.
WTF?!! am I dreaming?
Shout out to whoever is running Netflix anime department. They been cooking the last couple of years.
No fookin way... this also means Jujiro will show up and f-up the whole Kengan Tournament...
Yesss!!!!
Seria esse o one piece ?
Please dub in hindi for india
fuck?
0:16 2D OHMA bruv imagine if we are getting a 3d fight I'll be disappointed, I don't like the animation imo
Baki all day
Let’s hope this gives them time to adapt Baki Dou and Kengan Omega
connector vs yujiro 🗿
Tokita Ohma: Nah I’d win!
Guys let's be honest with ourselves  yujiro solos the entire keegan asura verse its eve a debate
Ufffffff pero que masacre vas a crear Netflix
Alright I'm hyped Netflix quit playing   and   release  it
Wtf 💀💀💀
Infelizmente o baki vai ganhar, mesmo o ohma sendo infinitamente melhor
Am i dreaming??😮
Baki gonna win tho
Get the hell outta here....😳🤯
Made a fight like in ratai tournament but baki team vs kengan team please
AYOOOOOOOOOOO
You got me hyped, ok Netflix take my money 💵
Baki slams Ohma. Cmon now.
PLS SAY THIS IS REAL
Baki better win
Probably the best crossover I'm FUCKING HISTORY
we all know baki is going to demolish him there's just no ways he's in the same league as baki
I only subscribe Netflix for this
Now, can we get Goku vs. Saitama?
Baki finna whoop dat ass
I can see Yujiro trying to challenge kengan’s whole universe himself
WHAT? THATS CRAZY HOW?
I’m going to say fake
noo way bro
We need Jack Vs rayan
This.. can’t be real I’m so skeptical of anything good happening under Netflix’s roof they’re gonna drop the ball somehow
The greatest collaboration showdown
How tf is baking gonna lose, the bakiverse is objectively stronger (kengan better writing tho)
So Manga and anime was diffrent universe because Kangan dont exist in baki manga universe Only anime universe had kangan
The two worst animes clash
Bro am I hyped beyond words.
Yujiro vs all
Am I fucking dreaming? I don’t think so guys🔥🔥 But Baki absolutely dismantles Ohma so they will make Baki weaker for it to be a great fight
Baki won this for sure 😈😈
Fan service Where IS musashi ! Bro where IS bakidou bro !
Baki and Kengan, inspired me to make my own battle manga webcomic. Without them I would have never have gotten into weightlifting and martial arts.
"Eles tão deixando a gente sonhar"
Neeeeem fodeeeendooooooo MANO eu TO EM CHOQUE! CARALHO! Que louco quem IROA IMAGINAR que os caras de fato iriam lá cara um crossover de kengan ashura com Baki
I'm sure they will become friends in the end
I want to see jack hanma vs  rihito
How the fuck. Ohma will recieve a big ass buff or smtg?
ITS TIME FOR A DEATH BATTTTTTTLLLLLEEE!
What’s more hype?   1. Baki vs Kengan  2. Tyson vs Paul
I hope the animation doesn't flop bruh
IN BAKI STYLE?! OH SHIT
I’ve yet to watch/read either but I’m still so hyped!!
What the actual fu-
I'll wait.....
Ohma's look in Itagaki's style is incredible, I hope they do their best in the animation.
Yo, this is more hype than baki vs oliver
Kenyan ashura and baki  Let’s go
Yoooooo fucking A
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT
Who will win Baki or Obama to legendary Fighters of Netflix anime HA HA HA HA HA HA HA LET THE BATTLE BEGIN😈
I hope they will be tie in the battle.
Mannnnnn this is going to be amazing! I wasn't even expecting this to ever happen but I'm glad they're doing it.
Fang vs pickle
What?!?!?!
My test increased 200%
I prayed for this and it happened    Drew McIntyre
Hell yeah
Netflix, you have no idead how hyped i am right now, lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😆😆😆😅😅😅 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA This really must be a joke! There's just no comparison, from how super unrealistic Baki is, to how slightly realistic Kengan is. It certainly seems unnecessary to me, the fandom is going to start a civil war. CMMO
Ohh 😮 it would going to be dead battle because next chapter I didn't see ohma tokita because of dead
This dream or not
It just means that maybe we gonna get new seasons of them both and they want to know which one's gonna be watched the most
Oh hell yeah!!!!!!!!! This is gonna be dope!!!! Yujiro vs Gensai would be dope!! People who have read the manga knows about Gensai and how strong he is. Yujiro vs Gensai would be insane!!
I’m so flipping hyped for this
Baki wins this, gonna be a war though
Thats crazy
My moneys on baki
nah they'll tie and then kiss aggressively
please be omega ohma
baki needs kengan to get more popular
I'm legit excited AF for this
They’re going have to level the playing field, because Baki characters are literally superhuman compared to Kengan characters.
baki win
This shit is f*cking crazy!!!!!😮😮😮😮
All you children getting excited when you’re mostly going to get a bunch of exposition.  Baki is shit.
I’m a huge fan of both but I like Kengan better since the fights are more constant and stop just talk. Though if this is prime Baki after fighting his father then then the only way ohma had a chance would be if he trained with kuroki after receiving few tips from the connector who is the yujiro of kenganverse
Yo wtf kengan is cooked
No the testosterone will be too much
There is so much power difference between them
I cant believe netflix actually did this fight between 2 legend i cant wait to watch it🤩
You were awesome, Netflix Anime. You were definitely one of the top 5 animation studio channels I've ever watched.
so is the army gonna get involved again or......
I like where this is going
I just cancel Netflix ffs
Stan bush-  YOU WERE BORN TO FIGHT
im fkin dreaming aint I
Well, I'm on team Ohma for this one, he defeated Ryu in the manga crossover they did. Even if someone tries to write it off as a dream, Ohma's image training recreates a fighter at their peak and fully realistic combat so. He should scale.
yurijo vs yuichiro would be better
This doesn't seem real
Pero la pregunta solo es Baki vs el men de kenga o también los luchadores de baki vs los luchadores de kenga ? Me entienden?
Theyre more than likely going to nerf Baki.  I love kengan more than Baki but the strength gap is very obvious. The only other person capable of holding their own against a hanma are either Julius or Wakatsuki.  Maybe some of the Worm guys like the connector.  Or Toa from Purgatory.
Akuma vs Yuujiro Hanma !!
Baki will destroyed  him.
YESSSSSSSSSSS AOWIHWJWUWNAISBWKWJWIW
Been so long that we get an anime crossover
In the Omega, Ohma unlocked some ridiculous power just with an advice from Shen Wulong 😂 I can’t wait for Baki to teach Ohma the principles
What we didn’t know we needed and we getting it!
This does not feel fucking real, it’s so soon and sudden
Yujiro is gonna drop in, beat some ass, make fun of then, and fuck off to have a drink an a ciggy.
how is this fight ever balanced
闘いたいからここまできたッ　経歴一切不明!!!! 『ケンガンアシュラ』の拳願ファイター　十鬼蛇 王馬だ!!!
😮😮😮
Greatest fight of all time🔥🔥
June 6 is my birthday 😅🎉🎉🎉 yei this is my gift 💪🏽🦍
IT'S TIME FOR A DEATH BATTLEEEEEE!
I think we're in Matrix ✨✨ ,Noooo wayyy 😳
Baki öyle bir döver ki biz fark edemeyiz bile.
and Shuumatsu vs Baki?
Haha, noice. Also, imo even tho' I still enjoyed Kengan Ashura? Tokita looks awesome in 2D Ngl lol.
They’re going to have to nerf tf outta the baki characters to make this a fair fight
I can't get my erection down
Isso é um sonho
I think I'm dreaming.
what is it?
Ohh Shit 🔥🔥😍😱👌🏽💪🏾🤙🏽
prayed for this shit
Lookism season 2 ?????
GOOSEBUMPS!! WTFFFF!?  LERS GET IT!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's not April, but the fact we're not too far from it, makes me a little nervous. (I'll come back to this later when I know for SURE it's real)
開幕の音がloud nigraに聞こえた
Who’s watched a finished both…..me
Original vs bootleg
lets go
Ohma gets folded
Ain't no way💀
I want baki to win but I have a feeling they'll make kengan win. If anything it should be a draw these two are pretty equal I feel like.
2024 REALLY HAS  UNEXPECTED MOMENTS
WHAT THERES NO WAY
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲Yeah boy🫠cannot wait for this
Are they actually serious 😮
Now is the time,Two titans meet-as it was written
Yo queria la saga de musashi pero esto igual esta god
la puta madre es oficial!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Put it on my veins!
I always forget that Baki, is in fact, still a highschooler
Is my eyes desiving me?
Netflix ya'll trying to compete with Crunchyroll I see. Keep the anime and live action animes coming.
OH MY GOD !!!!
Still preferred to have the rest of kengan ashura season...
YOOOOOOO
WHAT THE FUCKKKKKK
WTF
哇 連我這對拳願阿修羅只認識作品名，對刃牙只看過兩三集的人都感覺熱血沸騰
Lore wise, Jack Hanma is enough to wipe the entire Kengan Ashura universe . lol
Yo what?! This is awesome. Hype for real
I AM SO HYPED
Yujiro : "Nah, I'd win" Shen Wulong : Mmmmmmm
The only way that kengan ashura would get an hand-made animation it would be just a crossover 💀
based
Wait... This is Real?!
What a time to be alive😮‍💨
are we living in a dream?
Can't wait for this. I hope it's a tournament
I dont know anything about this anime but it's after my bday! I'm pumped.
are we living in a dream?
Hope it's a tie I love both these shows too much to pick a side lol
Hold on is this shit real ?  👁️👄👁️ am I in the right timeline ?
Should've done in Tengen's animation.. But definitely watching🔥👀
Baki vs Kengan and Kegan s2 part 2 noiIICEEE.
Fockin sickkk
Your kidding.  AAAAAAAA
THATS CRAZYYYY
Ummmmm duuuuude...........🔥😱 😳
Nooooooo wayyyy it can. Happen😢
Lest gooooooooo ❤
BRO. BAKI ANIMATION IS PURE GARBAGE AND THEIR FIGHTS.  KENGAN IS ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL WITH FIGHTS AND ANIMATION.
Netflix taking a huge w with this one
wait is netflix's...doing something like  deathbattle?
que foda
Context? How hyped should i be?
Baki will eat this boy alive
So, who is gonna win?
caralho netflix nem to acreditando nisso
最高すぎ笑
As hyped up as I’m for this come out this is one sided ass whooping that Baki gonna unleashed on ohma
Wow amazing 💪
I cant believe it’s Netflix that’s bringing this Dream Match to life! You would think they’d be a collab manga by now. Anyways I’m psyched for this can’t wait till it drops.
just dont put yujiro in it... or ir would be unfair and boring... he will stomp them all
Naniiiiii
Is this that one crossover episode with young Doppo?
AHHHHH, IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING. CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS CROSSOVER.
But 'Baki' is way more powerful universe than kengan asura's...I don't think that it would be a interesting combo...because as we all Baki himself only can beat every wrestler from Kengan Asura 😂😂😂 . . . What do you think? Am I right or wrong?
This is amazing! It's brilliant for a company to do a crossover between two different works that it has the production rights, Imagine Amazon doing a crossover between Invincible and The Boys. I hope to see more of this kind of thing happening.
No offense but this better be animated by a different studio and not the baki studio
kengan ashura is best
...and I alone, am the Chosen ONE.
The most fire shit I have seen in two years
Internet finna be broken💀
Probably gonna be a draw. The respective fan bases can't allow for their side to lose. I'm sure they'll find a way to be interrupted somehow to where a definite conclusion won't be reached.
LETS GO W
Money on Baki
WHAT
YES
no wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!
Да, это сильно💪👍
Well... that came out of nowhere. Let's go ahead and get Light Yagami vs Lelouch out the way while we are at.
Now i have to watch both Baki and Kengan Asura
NÃO É POSSÍVEL... DEPOIS DE TODOS ESSES ESPERANDO ESSE ENCONTRO E AGORA FINALMENTE ESTÁ PRESTES A ACONTECER! OBRIGADO NETFLIX
Dang, That's the most imagined battle of the Generation after Goku Vs Saitama! ❤
Not used to seeing anime crossovers and this one is top notch
😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😮😮😝ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😝😝😝😝😝😝
WHAAAAT
Man I was hoping they applied Kengan Ashura's art to Baki, not the other way around...
Finally
This as legendary as Goku vs Luffy
dioooooooosssss aaaaa
Será verdad????
Next Record of Ragnorok vs Seven Deadly Sins
Literal goosebumps
Baki: „you look like me, but older… do i have another brother?“
HELL YEAH 🎉
The fight of the century. It will be legendary!
I hope there won't be a draw between them. It would be a big disappointment if that were to happen.
I’m ready for this sh!t🤝
Netflix still sucks 😂😂😂😂straight up and this is a dumb crossover ,there only doing this for the views an money 🤔🤔🤔🤔plus the world's are not the same 🙄🙄🙄
Chicos aun que amen Tokita Baki es superior a el. Yujiro tambien se devorara a todo Kengan xd
YEEEEESSSSS
Ohma one shots!
No way it's happening
ID DIEEEEE FOR THIS!!! LETS GOO LETSGOOO
Wow
ohma better oil up
Wooooooooooooow
Mind blown 🤯
This is so great that makes me belive something horrible is coming and this is part of the distraction 😒 but Imma watch it anyways 🙃
Literal tears
First cyborg 009 vs devilman and now baki hanma vs kengan ashura
Yoooooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Unreal lmao
Awesome 🙇‍♂️
is this based on a manga spin-off?
Wtf?
Am I deserved to feel happiness. What is this???
I like Kengan Ashura more but I feel like Baki is most likely to win
Clearing my schedule for this day🔥🔥🔥
It will end in a DQ. They will not be able to finish the fight. Instead they will team up to beat another guy. Then have seperate scenes where they will say in their mind. One day, wait for me I will fight you or something of the sort.

Yo
This is lit! I am very excited for this 🔥
Impossible
Ohma is in Baki's world now
I feel like this is going to be the most biased work ever
And at the end it’s going to end up being a draw
That's cool but if they could actually finish Kegan that would be super great.
Just woke up to this and am absolutely floored 😮
That's why it pays to be a manga enjoyer.
Yes the octagon will begin June is Like UFC
Fudeu
This is.....THE GREATEST DREAM MATCH OF ALL TIME!!!!
😮 Abe sapna hai koi chiti kato be 😂😂

But I think that it would be better if Ohma was holding a machine gun.
Авторы произведений надеюсь все хорошо обсудили кто сильнее с учетом их дальнейшего развития ибо они авторы и представляют итог развития своих персонажей.

Man, the Ohma design is bad, he felt like a background character. Beside, I felt Baki bullshit will take the upper hand in the fight. Guys, don't have hope, it's Baki, il'll troll us.

What is this shit ? Is cakon or just fan service from netflix
Baki Solos 🤷‍♂️🥱
When will the new season out?
Obrigado ❤❤❤❤
*Please Netflix also do a collab with marvel or capcom.. I want to se Baki fight Ryu or Ken or wolverine or sabretooth or black panthet in those universes.*
LETS GO BRO, THIS BETTER NOT SUCK
Wil this be Canon? 🤔
No way!!
Ohma tokita is the man!!!! Niko style
0:17 🍷🗿                 🏅              🍿🤴 0:13
Wooooooow
Ohma > baki , connector > baki verse , An easy practice match for Ohma
Baki shakes Ohma's head to rattle his brain around and knock him out in the most painless way he can.
baki is going to kill him
DC vs Marvel!
LETS GO! ITS FINALLY HAPPENING THE CROSSOVER WHERE WAITING FOR 💪🏼🗿
omg i cant believe we are getting more baki series.And it will be Baki Hanma VS Kengan Ashura can't wait to wacht it!
Yujiro vs Shen Wulong!
They just kiss whilst the narrator excitedly tells us how that one type of fish looks like they are kissing but really they are dueling to the death
WTF THIS IS AWESKME
We're making goofy Shen Wulong, fight seriously with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Okay now finally make a baki or Kengan fighting game damn
Only non anime fans expect dis matchup, ie netflix wankers, baki one shots d verse, dis is a slap to power scaling, what's next meliodas vs thorfinn 😂😂😂. Nextflix pls stay ur lane
Вряд-ли создатели сделают объективный кроссовер с точки зрения силы. Вспомните кроссовер DB x Toriko x One Piece
Is this real because I’m not sure ? Plus the tournament is not even over yet there is still 8 players
They should give us a tournament like the whole China vs America+Japan from Baki or Purgatory vs Kengan stuff.  My Matchups:  Wakatsuki vs Hanayama  Gaolan vs Muhammed Alai  Kuroki vs Doppo Orochi  Julius Reinhold vs Oliva  Raian vs Jack Hanma  Kano Agito vs Retsu Kaioh  Sen Hatsumi vs Katsumi Orochi   Ohma vs Baki
Wait actually
AINT NO WAY THEY MAKE A TRIUMPH CARD ON THIS ONE
They will make it look like a fair battle. But we all know if they fight real ..Baki will kill him in 110 ways
O Ohma fica fei na art de Baki
Why they gotta kill off ohma like this.
This will be 🔥🔥
Fans can't appreciate enough 🙏🏻 Lord Netflix 😅😅😅
A grown men feeling happy like little children because of this news let’s goooo
Hyped.
Add Goku next.
Yooo! No way! Im just about to finish watching Kengan Ashura and thats so cool. I prefer to see baki in Kengan Ashura style but thats fine
baki destroys this guy its not fair
Boommmmmmmmm🤯
we all know who is gonna win right ? (Baki)
Teo Legends one movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oooooooo yeeeeeeesssssss

Man what they want us to see  I dont know will i side with probably baki  Even miyamoto musashi arc has not been animated  Is thsi even in manga
Me: oh this is probably some sort of mini game or a discussion among 2 fan bases that Netflix owns.  Sees Ohma animated: AINT NO WAY, AINT NO WAY, AINT NOT WAY.
LFG!!!!!
I want to jump and scream 😱. This is going to be an awesome day.
LEEEETSS GOOO but I want them to animate the musashi arc soon too 🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥

No longer do we have to fantasize their fight 😭
WHAT
I must be high
Урааааа наконец-то дождались!!!!!!
No way!
YOOOOOOOO I though it's just a fan made until i saw the end
With Baki’s animation? No disrespect, but hopefully not.
Hell f*cking yeah
This is literally so surprising that I had to double check if it’s official
Okay now I'm curious does this mean that they are part of the same universe or is this just a temporary crossover what do all of you think🤔❓️
CANT WAIT
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! GOOD JOB NETFLIX!
YES YES YES YES!!!!!!! Lord in heaven thank you!!! I honestly didn't think this would ever happen but it is!
This is enough testosterone to transition a girl into a guy lol!  Hyped for this
I've cummed
Oi oi yooo  this shit is 🔥🔥🔥
Nahhhhhhh... This year is the most hype anime releases!! After opm season 3 and kengan ashura season 2 part 2

Llega el choque de El conector 🧬 "Shen Wulong" 🆚 El Ogro 👹 "Yuhiro Hanma" ? Seria explosivo aunque lo dudo 😅 igual el choque sera o ver a Baki X Omha
DAMN!
Netflix please please PLEASE do NOT nerf baki!! Let him go easy on ohma & then when ohma gets serious, let baki pull out 30% of his power and then DESTROY OHMA!!!! 🍿
This is the biggest Blessing of the year so far for me😭
wtf wait no what huh? i wasn't ready for that wait *choto mate* man.
They promised us that this fight will happen unlike WB who rejected Batman Beyond movie
We are all here to see baki win & ohma get DESTROYED. That’s it. This should be a good fight tho.
I Hope you'll dub It even in Italian language.
We’re all here to see baki win. That’s it.
Wtf, lol I'm ready for this one
Kengan

OMG! I cannot believe. Please, Tokita you must be the winner.
They gonna nerf Baki by alot.
This would have never been possible if KENGAN and BAKI were not owned by Netflix let's goooooooooooooooooooo 🗣🔥🔥🔥
Holy fuck Lois I'm cuming
Yujiro: who's that muscular girl 😯
Almost canceled Netflix but ya just survived another year of taking my money!
But Ohma dies in the Manga, what is this his ghost?
I always imagine this as a death battle match up but an actual crossover would be epic 🤩
HELL YEAH I AM SO READY!!! NEXT TIME ON DEATH BATTLE
My goat, Ohma getting a better animation finally
This some aliens vs predator stuff, am in for it
Finally an opponent that might not bore baki to much….this should be good. Rip Kengan tho.

I love both! But ain't the power level on baki is not on par vs kengan? I wonder how they would do this! I love ohma but baki will fold him
Better than the Jake Mike Tyson fight
Honestly I think Pickle can beat Yujiro if he was trained enough, and by extension Baki
BRO, LITERALLY 5 DAYS AFTER MY BDAY 😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🗿🗿🗿🗿

"STAY CLAM, ITS F***ING HAPPEING. EVERYBODY STAY CALM!!!! "   Edit: dang my first comment with 1k views/likes thank y'all lol.
Two fighters going at it hell yeah
RIP OHMA
I can not believe this is reality !!!! Thank you Netflix 👏👏👏 Martial arts manga fans are eating gooood
Sick!!!!!!
Ohma tokita for the win
What a combo I am waiting for this
I recall there was a crossover in the manga of these 2 series when Doppo was asked by Tokugawa to participate in a Kengan match.
This feels like a death battle
Kids had their fun... now its REAL men's turn. 🔥🔥🔥
👹
OHMA IS GONNA GET MANHANDLED. ABSOLUTELY FLOORED
WHAAAT? ....... :0:0:0:0:0:0:0  I thought it would just be a promo with scenes from both animes available on Netflix xdxdxdxd
NO FREAKING WAYYYYYYY THERE'S JUST NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!
We actually got this before ironmike vs paul and gta6💀
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ohh sssshhhhhi+++🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😭
Baki was like "the hell i thought there was no one left?"
If Baki vs Kengen for two guests from Anime in Mortal Kombat!
This time on Deathbattle
Hopefully they’re gonna use the same physics engine 😂
honestly, I wouldve prefered if its the manga version. Baki art style on ohma looks hot garbage
yooo is this fr??
hell yes
wait whatt
Is this content from manga or original content?
Nooooo Waaaaayyy .. I simply can’t believe this !!!😮.. I’m speechless 😶..
This made my day
Yooo
This is fan service. But, THIS IS GOOD FAN SERVICE!!!!!! One that I approve!!!!
I never expected something like this would actually happen, but I'm happy for it.
Ohma finna take the dub
Fuckkk yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hell yea!
WTF
It's time for a death battle !!!
Knowing the writers of both stories it’s mostly likely gonna end with some character interrupting. I’m only hoping it’s some powerful foe they have to team up against😭
its one sided but its still so cool
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yujiro:
This got me so pumped imma hit new pr at the gym
Are you serious 😃
Ohma would put up a fight with his advance but Baki will still win against him no problem, but still can't wait for them to fight X3
I swear Netflix if this is an April fools joke!!!! I’m super hyped!!!!!!
El Anime de Kengan Ashura su estilo de animación es en 3D, esta seria la primera vez que se vea al Protagonista Tokita Ohma y a los demás de su "universo" en animación 2D, 😁
The name for this tournament: The Hakai high schooler maximum annihilation Tōnamento.
FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!
LETS GO FINALLY SOME NEW BAKI ACTION he too strong🔥🔥🔥
OHMAAAAAAAA!!!!!!! 👊 🤜 🤛 ✊️
ive never been more excited
*I can’t wait.* 🔥
Wtf!! Hermano esto es sexo!! Estos es sexo en meme
OHHH FREAKING SHIII!!!!!! WE DONT NEED TO WAIT ON A DEATH BATTLE!!!
Baki no diff
Is this bullshit or for real if so I'm very hyped😮
I like how its called Baki Hanma vs Kengan Ashura. So will Baki solo the Kengan verse? Could've put Baki vs Ohma bc that is what they're going for likely
its real??
"oh they´re just announcing the series ap-" *2d Ohma* OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Anime fans winning
Enough Internet for today.  I'm going to go to sleep and if this continues on YouTube I will scream with excitement
No way😮 i love you Netflix 😭
One of the most surprising yet hype fights in a moment
The type of adaptation Kengan actually needed. Instead of the 3D CGI we got.
It finally happens. These two would finally meet. I wonder how these two would meet?
Ayoooooo!!!! Let gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!
Holy damn.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't care about Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson cuz Ohma and Baki are going to have the fight of the century
Please don't be slide shows
holy fuck
YUUUUU*UUUUUUUUUUJH
OH. MY. GOD.
Don't ruin it with the long explanations and talks please
I'm so hype 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is real? I can't believe it 😮
In Baki Hanma we trust 🤲
I've been wanting this wishing for this it's finally happening I can't wait to watch this
No way!!!!
I'm looking forward to seeing this
I've only read baki, should i read kengan?
Baki gonna end that boy 😭
No way
Let's be realistic, Bakiwould decimate buddy
Netflix been cooking this whole time? 🔥🔥🔥
PEAK
Considering what’s currently happening in the current Kengan manga (Kengan omega) there is someone who can hypothetically be a match for Yujiro
HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO FUCKING LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I got $60 on Baki
5 days before my birthday huh
Oh my god this is going be fun  Baki vs Ohma who will win
HOLY

MY NIGGAS I CANT WAUT FOR THIS SHIT TO COME TF OUT
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
OMGGGGGGGGG
😚🥳🥳🥳
ohma ( after the kengan  series completion ) vs baki  would be crazy to watch brah. coz ohma is just getting started (manga).
We kengan fans be eating real good the past few days 😩😩😩
HUH
I love kengan but Baki he is so strong, its unfair. Even guy like Kanoh and Kuroki are just B tier fighter in Baki.
No freaking way!!!
How this work ots every baki character versus wvery oengun charactwr?
No way😮
😭WDFFFFFF
FINALLLY😭😭😭!
Family Guy and The Simpsons: Woah, We thought you both were just a fanfic? Baki Hanma and Ohma Tokita: Our fanfic was greatly exaggerated
NO WAY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKIN GO!
Is it a sequel??
Yu Gi Oh Bonds Beyond Time: I am the best anime crossover. One Piece + DBZ + Toriko: No I am the best anime crossover. Baki Hanma vs Ohma Tokita: Amateurs. One Piece + DBZ + Toriko: What was that?! Baki vs Ohma: AMATEURS!
Give me your best explanation: why would baki win over ohma? why would ohma win over baki?
Cant wait to see "the connecter" vs "the ogre"
Can't wait. Look too good
No f-ing way this is goated I’m hyped
Yujiro is soloing the verse😂💀
Oh my God they actually did it. Let’s go!!
Well, finally something good to watch compared to the Logan paul vs Mike Tyson fight
I just noticed the context of the animation is them passing each other across the street. Meaning they were just minding their own business and then went "Yo, new strong guy just dropped!".
Anime fans eating
Oh my God!! Okay it’s happening. Everyone stay calm! STAY F***ING CALM
Two legends collide
Current Ohma would still lose to current Baki but if you're manga reader you know hes bout to get alot stronger  Also Yujiro vs Shen would be epic
Holllyyy shitt🔥🔥🔥
Who would've thought that netflix get their own death battle?
Gasten tod0 el presupuesto en la pelea de baki y kengan
Hell fucking yeah

Baki wins
An Ova or a season?

How the hell 🔥🔥🔥
Posta amigo
The title should be Yujiro low diff another world
No doubt that these 2 r gonna become good friends after all is said and done
Ayee w
I would love for them to animate Berserk either with Baki's animation or with something less with CGI.
Now is it multiple matches against various character or something just a single match
wait WUT?? This is the ultimate fanfic if i ever saw one, except it's official
Prediction.  Is gonna be a double knockout or something is going to happen and they won't be able to finish the fight.
This was an amazing surprise! Kengan Ashura is so underrated. I want to see Kuroki Gensai vs Yujiro Hanma
no fkin way
SO SO SO HYPED FOR THIS!!!
nah mannn baki verse gon humble  the whole kengan verse and it's not even close 😭😭😭
Yeahh!!! But don't end this in a draw or a team up to defeat some other guy.
J'y crois pas 😅
For real 👀👀👀 this is legendary 🙇🏽‍♂️😱😱
Bruh this is too good to be true😢
Oooyyeeee awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
Making graphics like kengan ashura is more beautiful🤔
I hope this means that both will appear in TEKKEN as dlc characters
Okay, now this is hype! 🔥🔥🔥
Not even a contest.
Those who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like this comment 🗿🔥👍🏽
If the fight is poorly animated like the Baki anime is, then I'm not interested.The fighting in Baki is horribly lively
Oh 👀
I am gonna faint because W H A T
How?
This will probably be hit or miss, either an epic battle of constantly trading blows or half the fight being narrator monologues
AYO BRO BAKI VS OHMA A THING NIW
XDDD
I told my brother one day, who would win in a fight between these two....were gonna find out now  💪
Damn boys, we won big time. Let's get ready to rumble!!!
Now this is called hype.
0:18 kimi no na wa
Best crossover 🔥🔥🔥
As cool as the idea is it literally just doesn't make any sense. I mean...Ohma, right? How is he fighting xD

The GREATEST GLADIATOR MATCH IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!
Waaaaaaaaaaáaaaaaath

Goosebumps  I got🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Netflix is starting to be a huge competitor in the anime scene. This is some amazing stuff I can’t believe I didn’t hear any rumors or leaks. What a time to be a Baki/kengan fan!
are we living in a dream boys?
WHAT
I NEVER THOUGHT ID SEE THIS COME INTO FRUITION
ain't no way 🤯
This shit's cool and I love the Kengan series, but ain't no way Ohma beating Baki
Yeah let's go  I am Watching from Bangladesh
Holy shit my testosterone!! I’m ready!
YO WHAT????!!!
PQPPPPPP
Wow this is crazy finally i can watch baki kick the a$$ of his clown 😂🔥
I hope Dumbell Kilo no motoreru girls will make a cameo :D same universe as Kengan
A cross over between action/martial arts anime damn cant wait for this.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH
Big w, I've been waiting for a long time now, and it's happening. Thank you Who else has been wanting this ⬇️
DEADASS????? 😭
Woooooooooo yeah
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I WANT'IT NOW GOD DAMN I NEED THIS SH*T RIGHT NOW
Finally I have been waiting for them to make these 2 guys clash in a crossover can't wait!
This literally feels like something deathbattle would do
Netflix really created a "WHAT IF?..."🥶🔥
Gracias padre Netflix
NO FUCKING WAYYY!!!
The city were they are going to fight: ☠
Are they in the same universe? Im confused 😅😅
I hope it ends with both becoming friends lol
If it was in kengan animations it would have been better
NAO É POSSIVEL
Almighty Beard vs Yujiro Hanma
Yoooooooo !!!!
This is going to be one of the gateways for other anime to crossover, & battle to settle debates. & Maybe one day, but VERY FAR in the future... Even other series' that are comic based 👀
GET THE F*** OUTTA HERE?! We're really gettin this fight? LETS GO!
I'm curious it's gonna be a 2D animation (Baki) or a 3D cell shading (Ashura) style?
What's really omg
nikka what!!!!
勇次郎VS繋がる者やってほしい
Wow
Oh, finally Kengan getting animated with a budget > the cost of a can of soda! BTW, other matches I would love to see: * Yujiro Vs. Shen (obvs); * Doppo Vs. Kuroki (hinted in the crossover manga); * Jack Vs. Wakatsuki; * Pickle Vs. Tiger Niko * Retsu Vs. Liu Dongcheng; * mega Maximum Tournament Vs. Kengan Vs. Purgatory.
Rip Ohma
LOL, esto no es el manga de Baki x Kengan Ashura :0  Lo malo es que lo harán con la animación de mrda de Baki :/
Life is Complete! ❤

Let's go, baby. Let go  The hype is real The dream match we always wanted  The Strongest Creature vs The Asura Who will Win?
WTF
this is cannon now :D
Baki solos
Aside from the fighting, both Ohma and Baki will absolutely become great friends in my opinion 😊
If ohma is in bakis world then ohma will be leveled up like if baki was in the kengan wold baki will be leveled down this is gunna be awesome! 🍿😎
It has been decades , but now the world can finally have a conclusion

It better not end in a tie.
I'm having goosebumps 🥶
酷爆了🎉
NO WAY WTF THIS IS HYPE
2 months before the final part of the second season? This is weird.
It's very interesting, I really want to see this crossover and for those who don't know, this crossover is a movie.
pero esta maravilla que es por dios uufff
Baki: nuestra batalla será legendaria
Holy fucking fuck
Es muy interesante realmente quiero ver este crossover y para los que no lo sepan este crossover es una película.
I was thinking while watching Kengan Ashura wouldn't a Baki Hanma crossover be amazing...
AYO!!!!! THIS IS LIT!
NO WAY YOOOOOO IVE PRAYED FOR TIMES LIKE THIS!! IM SO HYPED
OMG, doppo vs kuroki could be awesome
Lo siento Baki, pero Ohma es mejor
🔥🔥🔥🔥

ahhhhh es un exceso de cine, abajo fifi
Hell Yeah!
FUCK YEAH!!!!!  Kick his ass, Ohma!!!
Im sire it will kust be a draw or some shit
Baki solo the verse
Ohma vs Pickle
me encantan ambos pero los niveles de baki estan rotisimos comparados a los de kengan  aun asi me emociona esperar este estreno
After seeing the fan art back in 2022 it's finally happening🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally!!!
The fight we didn’t know we needed
Good god. It’s happening
OHMA GANG!
😮😮
Definitely this year is full unexpected event Fans are happy by you Netflix 🙏
I remember when this was teased all that time ago. Can't wait to see the kengan cast in 2d animation!! Hopefully this doesnt suck.
Yujiro will probably end the fight after he came down from the helicopter, again.
Is this possible?????
THIS IS REAL? PLEASE TELL ME THAT THIS ISN'T A PRANK
😮😮 Queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The Prime Minister: Oh no. Evacuate the entire city! This is now their battleground!
how do i dislike a video twice
Let's goooooo Baki is back!!!!
Wtf🤩
Baki clears no concept of diff 💀💀💀 how is this even fair
yooo
Baki vs Ohma &  Yujiro vs Agito
Choque de poder vs poder  Que Crossover tan epico Netflix hoy te luciste
I love Ohma but Baki one shot  him I think Ohma  it's Retsu level.
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD 😱, this is true IT IS REALLY POSSIBLE FINALLY , fights that everyone dreams of, not only about these two, that is, baki vs ohma, if you don't fight like jack hanma vs raian kure katsumi orochi vs saw paing, and obviously hanayama vs wakatsuki takeshi,
Oh hell yeah
YOOOOO WTFFFF, LETS GOOOOOOOOO! Omg I can't believe this, so hype! Biscuit vs Julius, clash of the muscle titans 💪!
OYEEEEEEEEE
HOLY SHTTTT
Will we get Shen vs Yujiro? Was this why Sandro made him into a "walking natural disaster that no military on Earth can defeat?"
NO FUCKING WAYYYY
Omg it's really happening😮😮
Netlix you have my respects
Wonder what point in time Ohma this'll be, same as Baki, because both have changed alot with Kengan Omega being a thing. Not sure how much Baki has changed but judging by the Title being "Ashura".  Hopefully we see Doppo & Kuroki in Anime form as well😮
This is one of those few moments where it's really exciting to say: It became canon.
Omg ^^
Omg
???////////
I mean, lets be honest. The are both amazing shows in their own right, the over the top uniqueness in Baki is amazing, but Kengan Ashura is the better series for the fight scenes...that being said Baki would literally mop the floor with Ohma every day of the week and twice on Saturday.
THIS THAT JIMMY TIMMY POWER HOUR SHIT I NEED THAT!!🔥🔥
Esto es real POR DIOS DIJAN ME QUE ES REAL 😱😭😭😭
Ooh this should be a slobber-knocker
It's coming out on my birthday WOOOO
That don’t look like ohma
hell yeah
Holyyyy
Which 12 year old id behind this absurd collab ?
All right, the combatants are set, and we’ve run the data through all possibilities.  IT’S TIME FOR A DEATH BATTLEEEEEE!
Agradeço por esta vivo pra ver isso acontecer 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Even though Baki isn't my cup of tea, I really like Kengan Ashura so I'll definitely be checking this out this June!
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 alv ESTO SERA EPICO
Obrigado Netflix ❤️
You got to be shitting me, no joke?! Is this real?! I'm about to see this in June 6?!
Oh boy
Realistically ohma would win. But because of the ridiculousness of baki and how much plot armor he has baki would win. Kinda like one punch man vs goku. One punch man’s entire gimmick is that nobody can beat him. That being said they are gonna tie with no decisive winner.
Yujiro: "Nah, I'd win."    *But actually wins*
WHAT, NO THIS CAN'T BE REAL IM DREAMING
OEOOO3O VAMOS
Oh shit! It's about to go down!!
Usually this type of anime it will ended up in draw. No one wins
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm waiting for this a long time 😭
This can’t be real….
is this for real
"Let's see who's the strongest of them all"
アニメジャパンの重大発表ってこれの事⁉️
P E A K
If its Not Omega Ohma, Ohma lost
I’m just waiting for season four
I GO TEAM BAKI HANMA
I can't believe we're actually getting this match and in the baki animation style 😃🔥🔥🔥🔥
Comoooo????   El unico crossover, q hubo al respecto,  fue un especial  donde se encontraban de frente y no pasaba nada,  esto no salio de ningun manga, es totalmente original de netflix🎉🎉🎉🥴🥴😵‍💫
Nooooooooo(que buena noticia
This is a really cool surprise! Can you imagine Ohma vs Yujiro?
HUH?
A dios mío que esto no inventes
WTF
OH DAMN.
