Btw I’m still very much apart of 2HYPE lol and I will continue to be in basketball videos. I just won’t be in any contact sports for good, moving forward. As far as the league goes idk if we’ll replace me with another 2HYPE member or someone else outside of the group. For now I’m focusing on recovering from all my current symptoms. Please respect my decision as I would like to move on in peace. Thank you ❤
Praying for bro love you bro Jesus love you bro

Use ur shoes money and trading card money and put it in your body. U need someone who actually knows what they are doing. N your loaded. Lbh
Hopefully you get a speedy recovery from this concussion Kris. We love you bro
Wish you the best kris

All experienced ballers have to make this decision eventually. Injuries and pain set our limitations. Best of luck,  you will succeed in your next chapter
It’s fine stop playing all you do is shoot anyway
6 concussions isn't that many.
Arguably the goat of 2Hype
Bro you were the best in 2hype be well # giraffe gang for life

I wish you wouldn’t let go of basketball because you were making some crispy shots out there but yes I wish you better health or even go check a doctor or something what is causing you that problem probably there a solution too that or even might be something even worse so my advise do check up on that if possible I wouldn’t want something happening too you❤
Hope you recover well, you will obviously be missed but we all respect ur decisions to stop hooping.
Not my boy lsk😔
That last minute or so of the vid really hit me man. Had to quit baseball because of an arm injury and took up bowling and my interest in cars instead. Although my heart will always be on the field i’m still living my life out in other ways. Take care man and I’m glad you’re taking care of yourself ❤
ur a legned
Hope you feel better man. Keep your head high and be safe
Aye Kris, I’ll rock with you no matter what man. You’re a real dude and you inspire me to really try and do things that I want. Like if you actually see this I just want to tell you thank you for keeping it real and being inspirational for me. Get better soon man🙏🏾
So obviously I hear about a lot of concussions in football. But how is it possible to get 6 concussions from not playing football, but from basketball? I don’t get it
Get better man we’re here for u 🙏🏾

During the 3v3, I was talking to my television screen, telling Kris to relax and not play so aggressive. Kris kept falling, I was very worried. Once the game got discontinued, I knew he would retire basketball forever. I would too in his shoes. Constantly recovering from injuries isn’t fun at all
This hit hard! I saw the injury live, and when you left the court, you looked done! Love ya Kris! We will still be here, basketball or not.
It’s the same thing every year
As a bloke who has had 9 concussions they are no joke can’t imagine what I would be like if none of them happened
Do what you got to do bro.. we understand❤️
Hey bro don’t apologize we understand that you put your life on the line for our entertainment and its not just you kris you have a wife or fiancé and maybe wanna have kids in the future it’s abt you love ya kris I’ll watch u no matter what ❤❤
You going into the HOF of basketball YouTubers for sure, hope everything goes well.

I don't usually comment on YouTube videos, but this hit hard. Having something out of your control occur like that just sucks. You've had your ups and down throughout the years, but you've been an inspiration on and off the court. I sincerely hope that everything goes well going forward! I'm glad that you're still going to be an amazing entertainer you've always have been! Much love to you!
Prayers for you kris God bless you

C'mon Kris you can fight through. You don't have to quit just rest and recover. Your one pf the best hoopers out there. Just take the proper time to recover but I wish you the best in the future and we're all behind you.❤❤
🙏🙏🙏
damn
Honestly I didn't even know basketball players got concussions at least not as many as him. I think its about being fit college and nba players ir anyone that plays competition is fit physically works out or cardio eats right. I mean look at chet dude got hurt rookie year might of been out for awhile for a game that didn't matter out of shape tall and skinny are injury prone. It sucks w.e you wanna do man I could see no league games these competitive things but 1 v 1 against jesser or tye 2 hype guys can still do that. I've had concussion maybe 5 6 my side effects fir awhile eas low energy and lack of sleep and nightmares what helped me was getting healthy eating right no more microwave gang lol and cbd... idk if you'll read this but nightmares are related I dealt with noght terror for year nightmares screaming in my sleep cbd fixed it. Along with getting healthy.
Be you fuck em
Praying for you bruddah best of luck
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
🙏🏻
heard this before.
We will always be with you with whatever decision you make, we pray for your recovery.
I saw immediately when he did it cause you could see the expression on his face that something wasn't right something wasn't right and then the sun was coming in a window and it was blinding him you could see it I'm surprised he still got that dunk after he got the concussion
Dude I was just watching you're video "My return to pro" a couple hours ago and its sad to see this bro but we understand man wish you the best!!
I feel you focuse on your health and your family 💯 be safe kris
Hope u get better Khris, really sorry u keep getting injured but I think what ur doing is best for u. Prayers to u !
I’m praying for you Kris. I know your not just good at basketball your good at video games. I hope you and bri have an amazing life together. Hope someday you have 6’0+ kids in the future. Sorry about your injuries.
So what are you going to be doing for YouTube are you going to be a gaming YouTuber and no matter what I will always support you 🙏🙏
Kristopher always a bowl of mistake always a bullet basketball players for life
Be honest bro I’m a grown man I really can’t feel bad for you you’re way beyond successful in the life God was telling you the whole time basketball is not for you
It's going to be hard to get used to kris not playing basketball man, but I rather him 100 percent be safe from a life threatening injury that he experienced numerous times then risk it, possibly causing severe or life threatening damage. Bless Kris.
Prayers up
Sorry to here this bro. Prayers for u🙏🏻

Kristober take care
Stay strong brotha🙌
He was going crazy to
Stay up all love god bless🙏❤
Me sees the title: (gasps)
Through all the ups and downs, we're here for u Kris. You've made an impact outside the game of basketball, and you will continue to. This is a blessing in disguise.
The love for the game will come back
Love you bro was great watching you play basketball all these years.
GOD bless❤️
Rest up my boy
damn bro
Dude I'm so sorry Kris. This bothers me because you aren't getting to go out on your own terms. I knew something was off about you around 4 to 5 minutes into the game. you guys went up 17-6 quick and then all of a sudden they came back fast and won the game. I could tell you weren't urself just by watching how you was moving around the court. I have enjoyed every second of every time I've watched you play and put up the deep ball and sink it as a big man. I will miss watching you play, but do what it takes to keep KRIS healthy first and foremost. I will pray that God gives you closure somehow. Once again Thanks for all the great games and entertaining moments.
I hate to hear that but I hope you feel a lot better I feel you I broke my leg and I can’t do what I need to do and go back to normal and I hope you feel happy with yourself and god bless
🙏♥
All love prayers to you ❤🙏🏾
Aye Kris you gotta know that the real ones are here for you and not the hoops. Am I gonna miss u dunkin and dominating against ppl on the court? Fasho, but is that why Im here? Naw. Here for you bro, just stay safe and get well soon man ❤️
Prayers for kris🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Kris I dont care if you dont answer me but it means a lot to me if you read this. Kris you are a brave talentid man Who cares if the 2 hype members replace you you are always going to be the talest 2  hype member that does everything for his fans we all love you and I get it you have to quit basketball that is fine at least you have a happy and healthy life you need to stay strong a remember that i am your big fan and I wont replace you as my favorite youtuber i love you and hopefuly you feel better. YOU ARE MUMBER 1
🙏🙏
Keep yo head up fam when one door close another one opens
Coming from a college athlete (I play lacrosse at Washington State University) always know there’s more to life then sports! Everyone’s time ends differently, and I’m sorry you had to end your career like that. But know you always got supporters out here! Rest up and get better big man! 🙌🏻❤️
Hope u can get well enough to get back on the court but u do u get better homie🙏🙏
“'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. '” — Jeremiah 29:11 🙏🏾

Be safe kris. You deserve good health man
heaven for 2 hype Kris
🙏
I’ll pray for you kris
Btw I’m still very much apart of 2HYPE lol and I will continue to be in basketball videos. I just won’t be in any contact sports for good, moving forward. As far as the league goes idk if we’ll replace me with another 2HYPE member or someone else outside of the group. For now I’m focusing on recovering from all my current symptoms. Please respect my decision as I would like to move on in peace. Thank you ❤
Concussions are not something to take lightly i understand you and 100% support your decision.... health its everything God bless you.
It’s bigger than basketball fr your health is so much more important. We all know if it wasn’t for injuries what you would’ve been as a basketball player, get healthy and keep entertaining and enjoying life 🙏🏼
RIP 2 Hype Kris 🙏
Best of prayers to you, and hope to see you back on the court soon

Prayer for Kris I understand fully that you decided to stop playing basketball for good Kris I think this is a good decision you made for your mental health and your concussion you have in your head . Good Luck on your next part of your chapter Kris being an entertainer on You Tube and still make great videos for the content on your Channel I give you my full respect on your decision Kris so good luck for what happening next for you Kris  and I’m pretty proud of you of what have you done with basketball so I’m very happy with you there Kris so Thank  You for what you have doing for Basketball Kris and good luck with the rest of the year Kris so good to luck to you Kris from New Zealand 🇳🇿 😁. And also heal up and rest up  Kris for your concussion as well  on your injury as well Kris . 😢😢
i see it took a lot of strength to make this video. I've been a fan since you and cash had a first Collab. life moves on lsk. gotta make the best of what "hand" you've been delt with. hope you have a speedy recovery 🙏
once a hooper, always a hooper gang
Health is wealth. Stay safe kris we will support u 🙏🏾❤️
I'm sorry, Kris. Stay safe! ❤ 💯
That mic crisp as hell.
Prayers for you yo. Keep up the content and positivity for the world to see. You got a voice man!
kris love u
Hope you get better soon
Wow! 6 concussions! I can definitely understand moving on with basketball. I’d recommend a brain scan to bro💯just  so you won’t have to worry about long term trauma and other mental health side effects from the injuries. All love bro
I'm so sorry youre going through this bro. I hope it gets better soon. And as a 7'1 guy who makes content I couldn't relate to the "waste of height" thing more. When I say I'm not in the NBA people literally call me a waste of a human and they don't even know me. Best thing to do is realize how much you've accomplished and those people are probably just hurting. You are way more than your height brother. You make so many Damn people happy everyday. Keep your head up and I'm praying your concussion gets better bro. Much love from a fellow giraffe
Prays for you Kris
Take care of yourself don’t worry about us. All we are, are viewers and everyone wants good for you.
yo
Bro which vid
Praying for speedy recovery
Stay safe. Prayers for you my brother🙏
Concussions are pretty bad. It usually takes me a good 2 weeks to get back to normal much love Kris it takes a lot of courage to retire even if you feel "forced" to. I have yet to come to a crossroads but I hope I don't do that
I’m praying for you
Then leave 2hype lmfao.
love you kris i’ve watched you for years
Respect and love for you !
Stay safe Kris hope you the best
Daddy no
🙏🏾
Prayers up Kris 🙏🙏🙏
Hope you get well kris , we are all here to support you
Better to know when to hang ‘em up before it’s no longer a choice but forced, would love to see you stay close to the game maybe give us some game reviews like flight or maybe even like prospect reviews break down players tape stuff like that.
We’ll always follow you no matter what happens Kris. I’m praying for you. 🙏
We rooting for you kris. Stay safe and keep going!
This is crazy the whole time I’m saying how is that a foul on you or why aren’t they calling the fouls on them cause I seen you getting hacked. I’m heated to hear this happened even more at the sorry ass ref. Hope you start to feel better soon. I know it’s going linger in your head but stay strong.
get better brodie. Maybe start a aau team? Give back to the community.
Stay safe we understand❤

Love you kris. ❤
We will all support you Kris😢
Stay Safe Kris. We all with you everywhere ❤
Love you bro and you made a big impact in this community❤
I remember seeing your other injury vid a few years ago and being worried, because I could see you were devastated over it! Seeing how far you have come over the years and seeing the life you have created for yourself has been amazing! You definitely must do what’s best for you and your quality of life for you and your beautiful wife Bri! Just glad you’re physically recovering somewhat because even though I don’t watch your vids as much now I remember and still go back to the vids from a few years ago and just having a laugh from your banter, you are more than basketball despite you loving it, from your skits (better than Wi-Fi was the moment!) to your Q&A, cheeky challenges and story times . Wishing you the best in your recovery both mentally and physically! You will get through this and you will come out stronger in the end! 🙌🙌
Your in my prayers kris 🦾
Are u still gonna be in like 2hype basketball videos for example like the video thta came out yesterday
