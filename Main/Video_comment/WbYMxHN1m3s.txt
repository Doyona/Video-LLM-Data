Realism is a fact of reality and state of mind. If you believe it you can achieve it, but it takes a spiritual mindset to stay focused.

This sounds like the Old Tion Wayne, the fans who have been here since Minor, appreciate the growth big man, keep pushing

This guy knows how to make music its the reason he’ll last in this industry 🙏🏾
Edmonton has produced bare talent over the last 30 years, ranging from Universal Soldiers to Black the Ripper to Bush Obama to A1 from the 9, etc. But Tion really put Edmonton on the world map with Body 2. 💚 I remember Tion since he was doing that tracks with Kortion bare long ago.

🫶
Respected you until what you did to E1. You could have dealt with issue 1 on 1, instead you went for a 4v1 because you wanted clout and to seem like the tough guy. It makes you weak, tion. I hope karma comes around.
🔥🔥too lit
Why do these guy only talk about money… try and talk about something else…there’s more to life than only money … boring🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Nah I honestly got bored.

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
