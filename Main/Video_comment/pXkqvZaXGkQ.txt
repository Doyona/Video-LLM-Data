I’m from Jersey I don’t know you Bro…But You said the most important thing…Both of y’all still here !!! No one is seriously injured !!! I know that was your baby but it’s still jus a car !!! Shit happens for a reason !!! God got something even greater for you !!! Keep ya head youngin !!! Keep dropping content !!! I know this was 9months ago but the message of things could’ve been worse is epic !!!
THE FACT THAT YOU CLICKBAITED SO HARD MAKES ME WANNA NVER WATCH ANOTHER VIDEO FROM YOU
What did you expect, it was a matter of time for this to happen. At the end of the day, with the content that you was able to make with the car from YouTube, it pays for it's self.
So who wrecked it
We love your car and we love you it’s gonna be OK God bless you ❤️❤️❤️
How you gonna get it fixed and I know it cause a lot of money 💵
Cuz my motorcycle caught on fire due to a leaky carburetor. I never thought that would happen.
Bruh I hope you get another 1 and keep dropping content
It’s totaled cuz of USA law about airbags but this is easy fix less than 10k
F that car you better thank God you living! It’s totaled I know you happy now! Believe me when  I sold my charger I was happy! And you know why!
That bitch is totaled bro

The insurance company might total it out but the car definitely could be fixed doesn't look to bad at all
That car didn't change your life my brother GOD changed your life. You need to thank GOD for all your blessing and all your mistakes turn them to lessons my brother. May GOD keep blessing us all in Jesus christ name I pray amen
That car is a wrap. Ain't nothing but a car, they make more of them.
Stop letting niggas driver your shit 😂😂😂
Damn naw bro u caping 🧢👀
Who’s fault was it tho?
What rapper wrecked it doe dufuk this video def for the views lmao
Definitely not totaled
How did the airbags deployed with that crash I thought airbags only deployed when there is a lot of damage
You ain't no rapper tho
lost my srt jeep last year someone ran a red light , i was so hurt. insurance didn't even get me back enough to get another one
Let me guess.... Speeding in the rain? 🤦🏽‍♂️
Rod wave car did like that but I can be fixed and I’m glad you ok
Bro if the airbags is out it don’t mean it’s totaled my dad wrecked his airbags went out and it still drive able
Y’all gotta think in these type of weathers are wheels don’t got grip that’s why they say drive slow
You have another Hellcat
Take it to dodge they will fix it but it will be a lot of me
Who wrecked it
Dropped my first video of my srt8 review can Y’all show love please I appreciate it 💙💙💪🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Bruh u sound exactly like action pack
when i got in a wreck , my car was " totaled " but the airbags didn't even come out
That'll buff!
Who wrecked his shii ?
This not totaled bro 😂
Doesn’t seem like it was damaged a lot, you can always buy it back from the insurance if it gets totaled.
This guy said " i think my engine is still good NAH MY INTAKE ITS ALL THE WAY UP" LIKE BRO LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE ENGINE IS GOOD
Bruh u can fix it
The air bags will probably be the most expensive thing to fix unless there's more hidden damage
It’s safe to say mopar is the new mustang
Ok bet who REALLY wrecked it?
Thank god your still here and okay and that it was the car and not you💯💙
He touching the car like he can fix it😂😂
if it doesnt add up to 30k in damages you should be fine
Dam
Damn bruh I figure my man badazz or tootie woulda crashed it lmao na prayers for u n it's bruh
So who the rapper that wrecked it?
As long as the car frame is not bending its not totaled. But you cannot replace them airbags, so more than likely it is totaled.
Bro it’s gonna be ok it might be totaled but you’re be more than blessed 😇
L boat
I don’t know how I came across this video but it was like looking at my son’s twin and when you were sitting in the car something went through me .

All that matters is you safe!

Them dodge air bags save lives
How much will you sell it for ?
I don’t understand how is it totaled it looks fixable wth y’all always quick to say is totaled
U 2 Humble not to bounce back bro💪🏾💯💪🏾💯💪🏾
Shid me if a rapper in my shid I’m make sure he give me the bread beforehand too fix it
Glad you ok tho bro🖤
No cap that’s a easy fix
google:Many people believe, and have likely been told, that if the airbags go off after a crash, the vehicle is automatically considered a total loss. This is not true. While a crash that is severe enough to set off the airbags will usually cause enough damage to total the car, it doesn't always.
Crazy , but as long as everyone is good !!🤍🤍❤️
They gone send you car to the auction somebody going to rebuild it and be driving it
Yup insurance will consider it totaled once all the airbags pop. But if you choose too you can fix it on your own with whatever the insurance gives you.
If you don't be careful in the Demon then this will happen again so take it easy my man.
Bro I literally just lost my impala. 2 weeks ago. Story on my page. Trying to get in another charger ASAP!! Need $1500 more
He's gonna wreck the other one to, in the other video he clearly doesn't pay attention its only a matter of time, by the way that car is totally fixable

Dam wish you could have sold me the radio out of it....
what the fuck does this have to do with rappers ? cmon now

You should buy it from insurance and have it rebuilt its not that.
Not totaled just find all the parts including new airbags my pops does this wit cars I see new bumper fender new cool air intake air bags on all sides and at the feet new hood yo engine look good from what I can see it’s gon cost u but not as much for a whole new car
Honestly it’s completely fixable, those are just cosmetic damages but with the airbags being deployed idk… I say take it to a trusting mechanic you know and chalk it up, it might be savable tbh.
❤️❤️
It’s ok god givith an he taketh but remember he givith more than he taketh ain’t nothing but  another blessing coming
I'm pray for you but we just glad you okay bro that's all that matters Ong.

You can fix that as long no frame damage, you good. I'm almost done with my car and I replaced. The dash and all but one airbag and I have to get paint and windshield plus seatbelts unlocked and headliner fixed. It can be done, I doing it myself except the paint. But everybody don't want the hard way to do things.
The car is not totaled u can get it fix

Not totaled I can fix it still
You'll bounce back for a better comeback...
Glad to see you alright you can get another car 👍
You a real one fasho thats what come wit it stay uo
Just a lil advice, Don't let every body drive your car.
its only panels and airbags. cant tell what the suspension looks like. It's possible to get it fixed by dodge.
1st how many time can he say totaled???? the car is not even that bad. this dumb ass fucked up his own car. This is what happens when you do not know how to drive or handle the power of the vehicle you are driving. just becuase you can get a bank to loan you money to buy a hellcat doesn't MAKE YOU A DRIVER>
Finally???🤔🤔  check your tires and slow down,  it's nothing that can't be fixed. 👍🙏
paint trash af
A YouTube channel is going to buy this
It's not that bad, it can be fixed...
Its not totaled u can remove the air bags an replace the inside panels and some front end work ect
Ain’t no rapper wrecked nothing you did
At least you can make some money from it sell it for parts
I thought rappers wrecked the car
Ain't no problem it is total Airbus came out and everything that car done. You got this stay positive I see you coming back even harder

It depends on his Limit of Liability on his coverage plan. If its the basic 25/50/25 or 30/60/30 (depending on the state) then it could be totaled but if he has a better premium then he’s good 💪🏾

Get rid of this junk of a Chrysler/Fiat product and get a new junk of a Chrysler/Fiat product. DO not get it fixed whatever you do is not worth it at all.
Take it to a body shop and get it fixed. It don’t look that bad.
If you really like that car fix it.
Fuck the car bro as long as your still here 🖤
It’ll buff.
You can replace it. Same year same make a mile same mileage who cares it’s only things you’re alive be happy.

You said something that’s so real while staying positive through what you going through. You said we not even gone think about this in 10 years not even 2 months that’s real cuz you finna keep going to the top homie. Not on any money shit but you need to go and get checked out and have them look at your leg. You are most definitely going to feel it in the morning. Your whole body gone feel like you have 10 tons ontop of you so yea jus go get checked out homie. GOD IS GOOD

Bro theres no way thats totaled unless you bent your frame or something big
Man U betta take dat bih to goonzquad😭
No it's not total the insurance might say is total but the car is fixable Goonsquad you know who they are.... Yessir!
Looks like insurance fraud.
You can get this fixed. Got a homie with the same damage on his Charger and he got it fixed. Same airbags popped and all. But yessir you gone shake back fasho.

That Advanced Technology package is a must for all Scatpacks and Hellcats. Stops before you notice💯🔥🚀

Once airbags deploy it's considered totaled.
You good G 🙏🏼 everything happens for a reason brotha. Times will get better. You gonna bounce back fasho.
C7 time or c8
This what happens when you let rappers drive your car recklessly man rip to the cat

Yeah you can fix your baby up
Bounce bac
Should get a 2018 red eye challenger
They are gonna total it because of all the air bags.. but in all honestly. Your frame is hood. From what I can see in the video.. you just got some minor dents.. or you can learn how to Fix it all your self.. from what I can see. You need the current airbag. Steering wheel air bag.. bumper wheel wells and an smaller stuff. But if your frame rails are good.. you can still keep that cat..
Only thing that matters is your alive and you will see this car again after i buy it from the action & fix it you will see it all over my I.G🤣😎
Dude, I’m sorry to hear about that. That sucks man
Sorry but a kid your age should not have a hellcat you’re just too ill-equipped to handle it
Glad you ok 👌🏿 it can be fixed
Camel cat or cap sorry dog but if that’s your name on YouTube that ain’t right Camel cat bruhh feel better soon you made me laugh
It’s not totaled. The insurance company will make it seem like it is so they want have to pay for it. So that’s why they go the cheaper route and say it’s totaled.
Keep ya head up bro...and stay focused...you will shake back asap. Glad that your not badly hurt or worse.
My city💯 but hope your car is okay bro fr
Hang in there bro !! Just another testimony on life . 💪🏽
Is that a Chevy hat? Lol
The car will be fine. The good thing is that you’re ok. The car is not totaled.

Keep your head up brother.
It's good bro, you finna come back up 💯
It happens at least your alive I’ve been in a couple accident.. looks like just the front end maybe can be repaired
But it gotta be raining 😂😂😂

Dealership has all the replacement parts you need.. KEEP THAT MF. I’ll fix it shiii
People that kno nothing about cars saying it’s a wrap… once air bags deploy the car is done
Don’t ever drive reckless when you mad
That car starts it ain’t totaled! You’re better off keeping it.. Badhemi, josh and now you, got ripped off by Insurance, they deemed Badhemi 300 totaled 3 weeks later it was for sale fixed and on a car lot.. rebuild that bihh lil homie

i just wrecked the other day ik the feeling bro you’ll get sum better 😎
Insurance will definitely total it out since airbags deployed, it can be repaired but it's going to be tough getting insurance on it. It's something like a salvaged title now or something and they don't like insuring that stuff. I might be wrong but I heard that from a crack head one day
Los santos customs
You got it
Stay Up.😮‍💨
Miner set backs for a mayjor come back
I thought a rapper really wrecked it. Dang got me smh 🤦
Glad that you are ok fam

Go to the dealership it is not totally
The car is not totaled the airbag only deploys on super hard impacts and you can fix frame damage even if the car totaled that ain’t shit compared to what I’ve seen don’t get rid of the car bro😔

Easy fix bro
Worst thing is driving in the rain it doesn't even take a fast car to lose control

Yes it’s a loss airbags big expensive and they all went off
So did he wreak it or ah rapper did 😭
💔
That shit can be fixed.
It can be fit i wish the best for you brother

godbless you   you gon shake bacc
So if his fault , his insurance should cover it for u
What rapper did that
Its never over next the RED EYE
Just good that we know you alright that’s all that matter bro
Materials will whither away. Invest into your life.
Isn’t that fixable?😑
All it needs fixed is quarter panel, hood, and bumper, and fender liner
If the airbags deploy that means it’s totaled most likely
idk how your state works but hopefully that tinted windshield don’t automatically put you at fault 🤦🏽‍♂️😢 Cause they would use the excuse that you couldn’t see even tho that’s bullshit
Bruh I’m glad you ok but this is a funny ass coincidence Bc I wrecked my charger after getting McDonald’s
Love how you handled the situation. You really showed how much of a good person you are. Thank God you safe. Keep grinding big things ahead!
All that matters is that you alive and god let u see an other day you gone come back strong regardless but yo life more important then a car but keep pushing dawg‼️📍💪🏼

It can be fixed bro
You gone be straight
Step 1: trade for grand caravan. Step 2: off road until stuck. Step 3: spend 10 hrs digging it out by yourself at night. Step 4: still show up to work an hour after recovery, smelling like sage and manure, no explanation
Shake back Jack  A lot of air bags deployed and everyone seemed ok my condolences 💐 to the cat.  Got back harder but most importantly smarter. Young boy stay positive it’s only the beginning.

Best way to look at it is I’m not gonna say it’s 100% totalled Bc not all air bags were out but hope got the best
You should've got an ambulance ride to the hospital and lawyer up
Why you say rappers crashes your car “NIGGA YOU CRASHED IT” 🤣 but it’s ok bc you Fs got me with that click bait but dang I really wanted to see if any rapper did it 🤣🤧

He keeps repeating my car is totaled while I keep asking myself Where is the damage? Replace the hood, and bumper, probably the radiator and a body alignment and done.
R.I.P
Yea that can be fixed it's not totalled
Dont look like theres frame damage From the outside but I cant know. Look like a bumper hood windshield and some front partss. can get all of those parts from salvaged cars that still have an intact front in and replace the airbags and fault codes. Real fans not gon leave because this happened they gon wait to see what happen next  Much love
Work harder, get you some better
Aye bruh just stay positive and keep striving for more yes it was a major setback but u gon come to bigger and better things man and if ya really fw Camakat please just like the video he just lost what makes him money and what he puts out videos that we as his fans and viewers enjoy watching let’s try to make this video hit at least 80k-70k likes and share it as well

This is why there should be age and character restrictions on high hp vehicles with great power comes great responsibility! U are clearly not ready for such responsibility..

The moment you run out of driving talent.
Funny how some negative happen to him and it’s trending. Sad. Prayers too you camakat
Stay positive Lil Brother. You're still standing. It could have been a lot worse. That big pole could have did some serious damage. You and the other guy could have been killed. Blessed to be walking away from this. Something bigger and better is coming your way.
It can be fixed
Look on the bright side…Your ok And now we don’t gotta see that ugly wrap no more lol

You didn’t respect the car and neither did your so called friends....

He gone cry in the car
Who did it
Actually surprised it held up as much as it did. Cars these days are made to crumble to take the impact. I’ve been in the same position out in my little Subaru and decided to being extra instead of sticking to my where I was going. Life weird like that sometimes
You think you’re sad now….. Wait until you see your new insurance rates. 🤣🤣
Somebody gon rebuild it on me
The car looks repairable some body panels and a maybe a radiator and maybe you have to straighten the frame and some body panels
This is what Happens when Your wallet is Full and You shoe size and IQ are are the same. Dumb shit happens.

When he said he wasn’t ever plannin on gettin rid of that car cause it changed his life, I felt his pain rt
damn
First it’s josh now it’s you, man wtf is going on. God bless the mopar community 🛐
It's likely totalled because of all of the airbags, it's better off totalled because it would never be the same. Thankfully everyone is safe and you'll bounce back bigger and better.
Its not totaled at all. But I knew it was coming no hate shit u let everyone drive it and everybody can’t  drive and it has hella power. Bigger shi otw
Ay bruh at least god kept you alive. Cant be stressin over monetary items. More blessings to come
Thats Crazy Bro keep ya head up....

It’s not totaled bro
Shit crazzy bro same shit happened to me I’m still recoverinh can’t really put pressure on my right leg shit happens for a reason God got some better for us💯🙌🏾🥇🏆 Dont let that stop ur grind🛹 just gotta put that in the pass N move on🏁🏃🏽‍♂️💰
It might suck for rn but we happy ur alive
As far I can see the hellcat needs a new bonnet/hood, new fenders, front bumper, air intake, new airbags, Maybe an intercooler, horn, front crash bar (maybe), fender liner (drivers side), I don't think any suspension/wheel components are damaged but shouldn't be. It's probably not worth fixing it because of how expensive parts will be but either way if you don't fix it someone else will. Take your time and decide. If you do fix it you'd have to get it inspected and everything will be a long process but It's all up to you. Best of luck bro and glad you're ok!!
Hopefully everything turns out for the best!
We still going to support u
Fuck it bro it’s trackhawk season😈
How to sound like a rapper:  remove all consonants   ow o oun ie a raer:  remoe al onoanss
Glad ur ok. It's crazy with these YouTubers 1st Josh then Gavin, now you but all of y'all are gonna bounce back harder and like you said everything happens for a reason, who knows maybe a widebody hellcat comes out of this? Keep ya head up G

Take what you can from it
your positive vibe and energy about the whole situation is what I fw. best believe God has bigger and better for you just because you stayed positive through the situation. He gonna test you before he bless you remember that ! keep your head gangsta 💯 DEMON NEXT 💪🏾
When the air bags come out its totaled not only does it tear the fabric and all the fabric needs to be torn out and if the airbags deploy that means you hit enough contact break sum important.
Nigga you wrexked yo kar😂
Damn bro so sorry. I recently got in a accident like 2 weeks ago as well and I have a 2019 charger. The lady ran a red light and didn’t have a license and hit me.It’s not a cat or scat but I’m appreciative for what I have at age 17 and I glad it’s getting fixed . At the end of the day these things can be replaced or fixed and that y’all are both alive w no serious injuries. Cant wait to see the bounce back!
It’s fixable
Damn 😮
Damn Bru who was whippin?
Your insurance will fix your car
Who was driving?
The insurance company might not fix it but you can you only need a bumper a hood and radiator
Who wrecked it
Dont look that bad tbh
Hop you ok🙏🏾🙏🏾
Why does he look like he should still be old enough to be at school
damn bro. only up from here! 💯🖤
No just replace the airbags and hood and left fender and front bumper u gone be good 👍
I damn near cried when I seen dis cama I ain’t even gone lie mane,shake back gone be lit 🔥
Damn bro god gave u a second chance ur cars replaceable ur not remember that
They bih ain’t total
One less turd on the streets 👍
Stop letting the motherfuking rappers driving your s***
Go to a service king collision repair and they do the airbags
The motor and stuff is good, don't just let it go , I wreaks my Chrysler 300c into a tree and the front end was worse than that, u should be able to fix it, the frame might be a little bent but with heat and the right guy u can fix it, if it drives straight it is fine, headliner can be replaced, bumper ect can be replaced, ITS NOT TOTALLED
I know it’s hard bro. Just stay positive and thank god that you alive
Some companies fix them
It depends on the insurance company if they want to fix the airbags
ITS NOT TOTALLED, the motor isn't bad just Bec the intake box is pushed up, motor and trans is still good fs
Hope you good bro
So glad you’re okay!!
Damn dats a exit up from me prayers🙏🏾

When the airbags deploy the vehicle is totaled
Hopefully you have insurance. If you do, they will half ass  fix it but it will never be the same. You’ll just be the owner of a wrecked hellcat

Josh car now yours🤦🏾‍♂️
nah i dont think its totaled
They’re fixable when the airbags deploy, but most insurance companies don’t want to shell out for it. So therefore for the most part it be cheaper for them to total out the car. Glad that you and the driver of the other car are ok.
Glad both of y'all ok

Somebody gonna get your car for 5k .and fix it.and bam they gotta hellcat for cheaper than what you paid.WINNING!!LMAO

Goonzsqaud might buy it?
Glad yall was ok get that leg that leg looked at
Wow, that blows!!!! :'( At least you're ok. :)
No, airbags deploying does not automatically make a car a total loss. If a vehicle's airbags deploy and the cost of replacing them is more than the total loss threshold for your state, it would be declared a total loss.
Cars can be replaced. Your life is more valuable. Glad you are okay, youll get a new whip. Ghoul?
Dam not the Kat! But yea once them airbags go off it’s totaled the insurance mfs be too lazy to fix it
At least you ain’t hurt worst than what you are blessing just stay positive and turn this into a positive situation
I can fix dat
Just grind it out on youtube and run that bag up
Glad u good bro
What about insurance? U said he swerved into u right
The airbags only go out at 80 mph or 90
Hope we still support you ?! We with you now more than ever
I don’t think it’s totaled but they prolly will “total” it just cuz it’s an expensive car
This what you wanted right bro be a man about it bro why wood you let any dum ass go crazy in your car
Too much horse 🐎 power for you bro get a Honda‼️
Glad you aight gang! Now go get that Trackhawk. 🦅
Young king hold ur head up. Could have been worse man. All blessings bro. Like tallguy said gotta take the good with the bad and the bad with the good.
Bro I literally just had a blowout in the rain and I get on YouTube and this pop up😭
Sad to say man but most definitely it’s totaled not all my airbags where deployed and they totaled mine more of your airbags deployed then mine did and that’s bc mine was a 2019 with like less then 18k miles Main reason they totaled mine bc of the airbags to expensive to replace vs what the car was worth it wasn’t worth it
It cant be just get a new bumper and hood ☹️
Wendys didnt do shit its all you bro. Damn you think the public roads is your damn race park. You could be putting other peoples lives in danger. Damn bro just go to a drag strip. Stop driving fast on the public roads man. Thats what you get dumb@$$🤣🤣🤣

Look at @helloooimjensen hellcat your shi is no where near totaled 😭
Oh you were on the tour didn’t know what happened to you until I saw your car at the insurance auction lot. Glad you’re ok…on to the next.
I’m glad you straight family 💯💯💯💯
It dnt even look totaled to me bruh... atleast u koo and it really dnt look that bad... towtruck operator is booboo
It doesn't necessarily mean the car is totaled if the airbags deploy. It's based on the ratio of cars value vs cost of repair. Different insurance companies have different formulas to determine if it's totaled. The company I work for if the price of the repair exceeds 40% -60% of cars value we will total it. I can't tell from the video but it doesn't appear to be. Newer cars usually have a crash bar under the bumper which collapses and absorbs a lot of the force from impact to save from frame damage. But again without seeing it in person I can't say for certain.
Buy it from the auction and fix it
You still here bro 💪🏽💪🏽👑 Major Comeback !!!
dodge isnt foreign so the repairs shouldnt be to economic. dodge is pretty "cheap" brand.
sucks but I mean know where you are!
I’m glad you’re OK bro at least he was being responsible this time bigger and better things on the way 💪🏾
Y'all can see when he was holding the SRT badge he was shaking that means the wreck really hit him so prayers to him 🙏
Are you going to get it fix?

At least it wasn't a widebody. That shit would have hit the pole. Stay up bro.
Give the car to me
Trust me, someone is buying it from Copart to rebuild it. I'm in the car business and I can fix the body for about $3,000. Suspension and wheel about $2,000. Yeah. Someone can put $8,000 in it and get it back on the road as long as the major engine components are fine.
Camhawk 💯🔥 good u str8. Cars can be replaced your life cant. 🙏🏽
Aye bruh people in piqua can't drive for shit 🤦🏾‍♂️ but im just wondering what your were doing down here🤔

That can be fixed my boy 🙏🙏🙏
Some people don't understand what totaled means. Its doesn't mean that it will be undrivable. It mean that the insurance will not accept it so you cant drive legally. Usually happens when the airbags deploy.
Hope your leg feels better you still alive that's all that matter
My mans blamed the Wendy’s for the wreck
Rip camacat

I was just thinking what if this happened last night
That’s what he gets since he letting people drive
Minor setback for a major comeback ‼️ That saying helped me
most definitely not totaled
Just happy u okay bro
I would strip it for everything that’s reusable
All that can be fixed. I’ve seen a lot worse an it not be totaled. Most of the time if the cost to repair is over half the price of the car they will say it is totaled but it is definitely repairable.
2021 red eye now
Prayers bro

Nigga u bout to get a nice insurance check
Good thing yu got the hawk tho , good thing you good . I just lost my truck to .. shit def sucks !!
Hope you good bro 🔥
God is good for a reason🙏🙏
@khaltsrt he will buy your car
Many people believe, and have likely been told, that if the airbags go off after a crash, the vehicle is automatically considered a total loss. This is not true. While a crash that is severe enough to set off the airbags will usually cause enough damage to total the car, it doesn't always
bra better pay for that shit wtf
Who crashed?
Keep your head up my guy 🤞🏻 you gonna bounce back sooner than you think 💯
Don’t stress yourself man you can fix it bro don’t stress
U gonna bounce bck harder foo glade yu ok
You can fix it

It can honestly be rebuilt...if you look in the insurance auction and see the cars they have at auction that can be rebuilt you’ll be surprised I don’t believe it’s totaled

Dang bro glad you are ok how far are you away from ga bro
Bro please tell me you have gap insurance
that aint bad at all actually. that could easily be repaired. But the problem is the cost... your insurance will decide if it's totaled or not depending on the cost of repairs, or the other drivers insurance. Hood and bumper aint nothing. I'm not too sure if your engine is messed up. Your radiator looks fine. Doesnt look like it impact anything.. have hope bro glad you safe
Lmao
Means nun but good things coming🗣💯💙
Minor setback for a major comeback 💯🖤
it's not that bad

maybe both you and josh cars being in accidents is god preparing yall for something better
We already lost big red eye not yours to bro 😭😭😭😭😭
Something big is about to happen God have you in his hands
On who you wasn’t going fast 🤔 And you still got the track hawk you good
ngl bro this why i never really like taking out my most prized possesion my 335i... like everytime bro it almost feels pointless for me to drive and risk it all for some petty quick run to some fast food or to the grocery store or for coffee (my gf), anytime you could wreck your shit or somebody could wreck you. i always try and drive slow the least and keep distance from people and its a awd 335i, i hate being in stop & go traffic. everytime i started up my bmw and left i always pray nothing goes wrong especially when im making a run to mcdonalds or sum, i always take my time and dont rush people cus road rage causes accidents dead ass. i hate that you aint got a daily bruh for shit like this, im glad i got my girls jeep, we wouldnt give a damn if we totaled that 2002 for any reason, but the beamer..... nah i gotta bring her out when its worth it and even then ik i could possibly loose it all. so thats why i rather keep her in the garage lmao, you a dog for poppin out in the hellcat for wendys especially in the rain lmaooo i either drive my shit in the morning or at night, never rush hour or high traffic times
We gone bounce back‼️
Everything happen for a reason watch the blessing
Hope you good bro
Nooo not the hall at charger 😢😢
It can be fixed but not worth the money cheaper to buy a new one unless u really wanna spend big money to fix it
u good bro just a whip but dude who hit u buggin
It’s not total
Time to bounce back and get a better one. This is just one setback. You had so many good times in this car to just let it go like that. Thank god you're all good  edit: Why are you saying "I hope yall still support me after this" Like we are not here for the car. We are here for you my man, and we aint goin anywhere
Shii he gonna buy you a new cat
“BOI AINT NO WAY BOIII AINT NO WAYYYY” TIKTOK VOICE 🤦🏾‍♂️ I’m so sad
😔😔😔😔not the hellcat
Good thing you alright 🙏🏾 You’ll get it back
Y’all clowns in da comments act like y’all are insurance adjusters, “it ain’t totaled” “u can get that fix”!! Leave that up to his insurance to make that judgment!
from what it looks like the front bumper and the air bags is the only damage
Damn man
MOPAR TILL I D.I.E GOOD RUNS😞😔💯

God put a blanket over you bro. A car can be replaced. All that means is more content is down the road for you. Take advantage of this time and thank the big man for all of your blessings. This was a close call. If you can walk away with a bruise and a banged up ride, something went right.  Still going to be tuning in going forward
It’s a whip bro. That shit ain’t nothing I’m already knowing you got something already or in motion. You alive and not seriously injured. THANK GOD IN HEAVEN!!
