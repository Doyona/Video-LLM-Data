Thanks again for all your incredibly generous donations everyone. Don’t forget if you can’t afford to donate, simply drop this video a like and help raise more awareness.
So I'm getting caught up belatedly on all your content Tom and I particularly like the How Not To Travel and the Tenner In My Pocket because they're uplifting because they demonstrate the kindness of strangers, altruism and good samaritanism which is sadly lacking in todays society (lesson: maybe it IS there, you just have to look for it?) and it occurred to me: but what do YOU contribute Tom, what do you pay back, other than trespass and freeloading, until I saw this video.  Good work man! My bro died of suicide in 2014 btw.
This is actually f-ing impressive! 😮🎉
I'm at 28:26 and I'm so ****ing confused. I thought you DEPARTED from Newcastle? I thought you were heading WEST? Do I need to eat??  Well done Tom and the entire support crew. Kind of amazing, right?
So proud of you Tom. Job well done!
big adventure for a good cause - Tom youre an inspiration!
Got tearful at the end well done Tom.
30:21 Ahhhhh, good to hear you speaking Welsh!
When you thought you were low blood sugar sounded more like low electrolytes. I'm prediabetic and fast for 3-5 days whilst doing a physical job.  Your liver produces glucose when it needs it via gluconeogenesis (using body fat as fuel) I've had low blood sugar and you will shake like a dog sh!tting razor blades........... but when you are low in electrolytes, you suddenly lose energy, feel nauseous and crave food...... you ate a toffee crisp and mini cheddars which are high in sodium.... 👍🏻  Bingeing your content again and thought I'd add to the boogie rythym 🍺 Well done all 👌🏻
Thanks Tom and everyone that helped you for doing this. What a great cause.
Sorry to hear about the passing of your friend Jim. It gives a lot more context to why you’re so determined to do this. I respect the hell out of it man.
8:47 dude I knew Ben was a skater based off the converse and the butthole surfers shirt 😂 Wasn’t expecting the English leap of faith clip. Fucking wild
Today I had a meeting with a bloke named Harry Wang.  Just thought I needed to share.
Amazing feat, and keeping that same ball too without losing it or destroying it is incredible. Such a fun video!
Next time you do it, you should carry some coals
Headed to this video to fill the Hardest Geezer + Stan void post project Africa - was this the start ???
Well done Mate!
Epic man!
Such a great achievement to be made! Big up GeoWizard and the crew.
I’m depressed and this is inspiring, thank you
As the blood red colours of the deep early hours began to garnish the night sky.... your poetry is unmatched
Nice one brother.
Only one thing disappointed me in this adventure - that "World in motion" by New Order appears never to have been played! Cracking achievement Tom and one for the half-drunk story telling after Christmas lunch!
killingworth a amad name 4 a animal rescue spot , congrats tho massive achievement!
I don't know how to explain this but this video gives me the same nostalgic wholesome vibes of a Pokémon game. Walking all the routes, arriving in a new town, victory road to the Pokémon League.
Brilliant
26:01 the most British moment ever, an inanimate object makes a challenge, beat it and tell it to fuck off.
Man why is this guy never out of the woods?
Been doing a bit of a binge of your content, Tom, and this was the most emotional video by a long way. As someone with depression and anxiety, I just think it's important to tell you that you've achieved something truly special for a fantastic cause. Huge respect. You'll have inspired hundreds, if not thousands, and you just can't buy that. Absolute fucking legend.
😊 great stuff 👏
What a great community <3
Congratulations! Respect, mate.
Wow. I'm always moved by your missions Tom but this one really packs an emotional punch - it is a MAMMOTH feat and, tied in with the morale, the purpose, the message, and the victory of it all there is something truly beautiful about it. Really lovely stuff mate, well done to you and the rest of the gang :) I am now very much a devotee of your excellent channel and can't wait to see whatever it is that you'll be doing next. If any of your missions ever bring you down south (I'm in Kent), I'll do all I can to join in in whichever small way I'm able, even if it's just to say hi as you whizz past me on some random public footpath. Cheers!
I watch this on a treadmill. Watching somebody put more effort into training than I do is motivating.
Challenge 2. Dribble a ball from Lands end to John o'grotts
Ahem, rude!  28:54
Wow. This was amazing from start to finish
incredible effort. For some very worthy causes too. Great job
What a legend
Wow! So much of this is so dangerous. Super entertaining to be fair. Really well done!
wow. congrats
Twice Brewed (before Hexham) is right next to Once Brewed Thank you Northumberland for the inspiring place names
Enjoyed that part even more the moment Soft Play (ex Slaves) kicked in))
It's wild what we can achieve without a good nights rest
Amazing.  👍👍👍
Great dribbling my brit
Absolutely epic. Loved watching this.
2:42 With cameraman Stan now in the van, eating some well earned scran :D
This is incredible that a GeoGuessr youtuber was able to do something so historic and basically make their own documentary about it. This is actually crazy that I'm watching somebody kick a football across Britain for the very first time in history and it's free to watch and not being broadcasted on tv.
one of the greatest, came back to rewatch
tom you re a fucking legend
Good stuff Tom 👏
incredible job !!!!! fantastic viewing as always
Sorry to hear the sad story of your friend. All the best to you
2:37 Geowizard spitting bars
Awesome adventure. Something I would definitely do. Love Ultras. Hopefully you do more like this, I’m jealous. 🎉
Mate props to you for flying through it. Should do it lengthways next time. Whats song are you singing at 33.55 ? Cracker of a tune
whats the music called you always use? what kind of music
I think the best schedule for something like this is is starting and ending at daybreak. The night really does make time fly by and the lower traffic is good for morale. Seeing the light of dawn peaking over the horizon gives you enough to get to the end.
Depression is a lot less bad when you have friends you can depend on
Shit these guys are fit. Doing this as a bike ride in 24 hours would not be easy.
Jims story tho <3
18:53 I always say that you'd be surprised at just how far your two legs can take you.
Ammar Kahrod is the name of James Brindley's murderer. Smart people can figure out the rest.
What’s the beat at 16:17
True determination
2:56 glad to hear you got Gordon Freeman with you on the hike
28:50 was my favorite part
Legendary video series
This is an incredible achievement man, absolutely beautiful. Also, I did not expect the words "needlessly murdered" to follow after you named your mate Jim, that hit hard. That must've been horrible for everyone, can't imagine how you felt. For some reason the "give now" buttons are greyed out so I can't click them, so if there's any way I can still donate, please let me know.
I really want to try this
this was surprisingly very wholesome. Great stuff
That was inspiring. Thank you! 🥲
Fucking legend 🎉
Пройди Россию пж
GET IN THOMASS!!!
Brilliant as always, congrats!
30:07 😂
The real athletic feat is pushing through it with coldplay following you
fucking brilliant, love these videos and you are incredible.
Another amazing adventure - congrats guys 💪🏻🤩🙌🏻
a beautiful bit of film and you continue to ba person of insiration- noone has these bounrderies and you haved proved it these 2 epiodes- your (in my books) what we call a fookin ledge! now get your butt back on geoguessur cos your brill at that too!! <3 cant wait for the next one
Top class video mate! In a climate of clickbait and 'clout-chasing' on YouTube, I cant describe how refreshing it is to watch a channel like this. It truly encapsulates what this platform should be about.  Cheers pal 🍻
I gave you 70km. Very impressive!!!
What you did is absolutely amazing, I doubted you, and for a reason... Your average speed was my full sprint speed. Not quite, but you get the idea. What I don't quite get is why did you end your journey in Newcastle, and not in Tynemouth? You had the time, and seems like you had the energy...
Get in, Tom!
The secret hero of the story is the ball. It held up much better than i would have thought.
Fix You is an all-time TOP song, I'd be absolutely *booking* it and belting my lungs out during the build-up and rock-out section of that tune. What an absolute joy this series was to watch, and for such an incredible cause. Every one of you on this team (perhaps especially cameraman Stan 😉) is a legend. Well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
As someone who’s found a passion for the outdoors and exploring in the last two years this just impresses me so much. Hell of a job to you and whole team it’s so inspiring, and for a great purpose as well!
Thanks mate, been struggling with depression for 3 years and still have days where I just cant get out of bed. It is inspirational to see what you have done and it is a good reminder that better days may still be ahead.
my mans balling
CHEers mate, that was super awesome!
how did I only just see this video, I've been waiting for it.
What a journey, thank you for producing another incredible adventure and bringing us all along.  I have no idea why, but when everyone was cheering at the end, the pub scenes, the fans turning out to greet you, it was so emotional as a viewer!
24:20 perfect song for running!
In all fairness, Lionel Messi could never do this! Congrats Tom, you are the best youtuber in the world
You are an inspiration for me Tom,
It feels criminal that I can only like this video once. Brilliantly done.
I could drive across this part of the UK in the length of time it took to watch this series, crazy.
Phenomenal series, what a hard working team to overcome such a challenge, and all for a good cause. Fantastic stuff really 👍🏼🎉
Amazing job mate, can't believe that it was possible!
so glad we decided to watch this! kudos
some of the banter is top notch.   "i want a pint of guinness in a carling glass"
brilliant journey. makes me want to take some long walks across England and the wider UK.
Thank you so much for this journey, Tom. As a young lad, I'm struggling really hard the past two years. There were times where I almost gave up and there were times when just one railing on a bridge that saved me from doing something awful. This video made me realize that all the goals I'm striving for are achievable no matter the lenght and time. I gave up too many times before, I won't again. Fighting is part of the process and we have to make the most out of it and even in the direst of times laugh a little to ease the pain. Hope you and all who are reading this are doing well and a huge thanks to you Tom for acknowledging the struggle some of us go through. Cheers.
how about jumping over homeless?
What a beautiful ending!! Thanks Tom!
Big respects to all involved mental health is important ❤❤❤
It took me a while to get to this video because my family is going through a rough time, but I'm so glad I finally caught up with this. It made me tear up in the end. Love these videos and all you do.
24:52 music heals.
These videos are absolutely inspiring
Beautiful you guys did amazing
You are an absolute legend mate
Inspiring man, got me out of a hole today
jesus it really makes me think about how unhealthy i am xd I'd be beaten after 3km
Congratulations Tom, and the entire crew. What a huge achievement!
All love!
Well done!
From a guy that dont live in the UK, Newcastle is fuc*ing beautiful
30:05 "Wilson" hahahaha.
Amazing Everyone!!
a soccer ball
Mate this was an absolute delight to watch. Keep going Tom , never stop ❤❤
You misspelled soccer ball.
Tom, you continue to blow me away with these incredible journeys. Major congratulations to you and the support crew for completing this challenge! You are an inspiration to so many.
Congratulations to the whole team for this fantastic achievement!
Well done! What an achievement. Many of us subscribers doubted if this was possible inside 24 hours but well fucking done! These challenges are brilliant and I can't wait for your next challenge!
Ok who tf is cutting onions up here!?
Congratulations, Tom!
You damn well proved me wrong!  Apparently I'm an idiot!  Unbelievably well done, you legend!!
Well done everyone, love you all <3
Amazing, your team was next level!
BRAVO !  ! ! !
i want a pint of guiness in a carling glass made me laugh too much
Amazing achievement. But I'll admit I nearly turned off when that guy put on Coldplay. Jesus Christ.
You are amazing
Absolutely fantastic! Even if something like this has ever been done before, I don’t think that diminishes achieving this kind of effort at all. Well done
Great job, Tom and the team! What an inspiration to watch!
To Kick A Mockingbird. Bernerd Show
If you are interested in trying another straight-line-challenge in Central Europe, there is basically a straight line running right from the "Dreiländereck" (tri-country-spot) Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg to the Dreländereck West Germany, East Germany and Czech Republic. It's less than 500kms without any major lakes on it and only slight variations in elevation, so no mountain-scaling or lake-crossing required, more of an endurance and way-fiding, forest- and road-overcoming challenge. Also, given Germany's dense urbanization, there is a high chance of passing through some scenic cities were you could rest for the night or get some local refreshments. You could probably even pass by Frankfurt, one of Germany's major cities, just about halfway in between, really convenient!
A well deserved beer
This sounds like a blast. Due to a disability that is only getting worse, it's become much harder to walk, especially for long distances/ long time. Running isn't an option. I've been trying to play disc golf once a week and build up from there to try and develop my calf muscles, which is non existent now. I've always had atrophy issues, but this type of endurance challenge is always fun to test yourself, especially if you have your friends with you. Thanks for allowing people like me to experience journeys like this!
I can't believe I actually started to cry at the end, well done mate! After all these challenges that did or did not go wrong there's this one that went (almost) perfectly. You finished it and even with some time left. Congratulations.
Oh man, i may have shed a tear or two 🥹 your buddy is so proud of you Tom!! and we all are too
what an absolute chad cameraman, how the hell did he manage to keep up that well. And im surprised that camera rig weights that much!
I cant believe it ended in such a sad way 😢 better luck next time Tom we support u so much and believe in youuuu
9:28 so happy the one u.s sate you named that made the cut in the video just so happened to be my state 🤣
Great job everybody
Can't believe this has me teary eyed! Tom you're a top top man and I wish you all the best forever mate.  Respect for your crew and Verity too! ❤️
Thank you for the laughs and dedication to the charities Tom and team ! Cheers from Belgium <3
What is the first song they play at 24:20? it sounds so familiar but I can't figure it out
Just wanted to say that this was an absolute inspiration! Also great job to you and the entire crew! Lovely bunch it seems :)
You've come a long way since your first straight-line mission in Wales (that's where I found you on Youtube)! Well done, Tom!
Hi Tom, you are probably not going to see this message, but I'm leaving it here anyway:  Last week I was on a hiking trip in Norway. On paper the trail looked relatively simply. And since I got it from the DNT website (it's the Norwegian hiking organisation, if you will) I didn't put too much thought into potential difficulties. Turned out the trail wasn't even marked for most of the time and sometimes lead through thick bushes, swampy area and across many many rivers without a clear way of crossing it (sometimes there were crossing aids which made me realise that, yes I am still on track). Anway, the reason why I am posting this comment is, that while I was fighting my way through thick underwood, bushes and swamps, while getting wet feet and carrying 17kg in my backpack, I kept thinking of your straight line missions. And as stupid as it may sound, your videos gave me extra strength to carry on. Because I got a very tiny glimpse of insight into how you must feel from time to time, fighting through bushes and forests, in an attempt to cross a country in a completely straight line. First of all, this makes me appreciate your efforts even more, and second, I was driven by the thought "if Tom can keep pushing forward, so can I". Believe it or not, this thought really helped me pushing through and make it back to civilisation.  So, this comment is a very honest and very heartfelt "Thank You!" and please continue to do what you are doing. You are really making a difference here!  PS: Oh, and I did not walk right through a bog and nearly got stuck, so there's that as well. ;)
GTF IN !!!  Well done; what a fantastic achievement!
Hope you’re having a good rest! You deserve every bit of it and I can’t wait for the next video. *tip my hat in Texan*
Top work Tom and Team, great charity choices also, keep up the good work but only after a good kip! 🤘
Massive respect to everyone involved, and for a fantastic cause too. Keep it up!
“That’s not a good sign by the way”  The sign: ☹️
Congrats on the mission, some great charities to donate too!!
do it again with a rugby ball
Still blows me away how tiny England is.
man, i don't have words!!! Everything from motivation, purpose, planning, training, D-day endurance, camera work, editing narration, music.... everything was as good as it could've got congratulations Tom,for completing the mission in flying colours, as well as for helping those who need help looking fwd to more of these!!!
your geoguessr skills are off the charts now!
Ginger Beard is only traveling along in the secret hope of encountering Brienne of Tarth
Video idea. Furthest distance a ball travelled for a MEGS!
This is the most British video I've seen in my life lmao
Awesome challenge, awesome cause, awesome videos. Mad props to everyone involved in this. Already looking forward to see what you madlads are going to do in the future!
Next kicking a soccer ball 3,500 miles across USA
Great video mate! Amazing stuff!
You should have had a goal at the other end to kick it into.
Truly imbelievable. Being a very much amateur ultrarunner myself, seeing you do football steps and light jumps with upwards of 80K+ is insane. You must've had really good training.
Absolute fucking warriors, huge achievement.
Well done mate. Absolutely top notch achievement!
Why do I feel like this was the last youtube video the Queen viewed? Rest in peace.
It’s really nice to see a successful mission. Benefits of good planning, proper training, and a solid support team. Well done.
Every time I hear about Tom’s friend, it creates this odd duel feeling inside me. On the one hand, it’s always difficult to face how cruel and unfair this world can be (seemingly against the most undeserving of people). On the other hand, I hear about this tragedy from an American point of view and I just become enraged. If something like a knife can do so much harm, how in the hell can we even think we stand a chance over here when we literally have to face the threat of gun violence. And for all those people that say “blah, blah, blah the number of incidents where someone was killed by a gun is insignificant compared to where guns have prevented a crime from occurring” just go ahead and ask if that’s the kind of solution people in a country like England are looking towards. You’ll notice that their first instinct isn’t to say “if only he had been armed with a gun”.  Sorry for my ramble. I’m just frustrated that so many people’s solution to violence is for “defensive” violence.
Me and a group of friends are doing the 3 peak in 24 hours challenge at the end of the month and raising money for MIND for mental health. This is so inspiring 😌  We've had no real training so it's going to be a slog but we've got this
I keep forgetting that the UK is so much more north of anywhere in the US outside of Alaska.  A bit strange to see the sun beginning to rise before 4AM, but during the Summer months I guess that would be the case there.
"The gaping net that was my brain" LMAO. Yo that shit was fucking hilarious bro.
14:46 "knife crime" LMFAO here in finland almost everybody carries a knife with them and there's no "knife crime". Maybe the problem is not the knives? But sure thing, keep telling people to "bin that knife" LMFAO the absolute state of the UK
When I'm hiking and I get so weak and trembly and have no appetite at all, I'm usually low on electrolytes. I've watched a couple of your straight line vids, and now this, and it seems like the food and drink you consume often aren't really optimal for intense physical activities. Perhaps bring a sports drink with you next time, if you didn't this time (I couldn't see anything, but who knows what's going on off camera). It also helps you drink enough, because it's also very easy to get dehydrated when you're constantly on the move. It's not all about blood sugar and calories, consistent intake of food and water is just as important.
What an inspiration you are man! This video deserves so many more views.
Well done for completing what looked like a very tough challenge, Tom & co, and for great causes too. I really enjoy your videos and they're inspiring me to perhaps do something similar in the future. I look forward to your next adventure!
Great video, and what an achievement! Makes me want to get more active. Not sure if you edited this Tom or your new camera man editor, but great work on this one, the edit came together really nicely.
What a legit fucking team. inspirational.
love it. tuen off the motor when standing you guyyyys
Tom's Fifa dribbling skills are easily 99 after this :P Congrats buddy! Hope to see you all on another adventure soon!
I dont know why but I dont like this series. Looks comercialized completely. Its not raw as previous content
Great adventure! Can't wait to go on another bike trip myself again! Multiple days, doing everything you can to make it to each day's stop... so much fun :)
Hey Tom   I caught you after you had finished before you headed into the pub. Well done again mate, cant believe how fresh you still were. Amazing challenge, worthy cause and great content. Enjoying being part of these with you.  Thanks Craig.
Wow, big respect. When I first heard you mention this project I thought you were totally mad and there was no way it was achievable. Brilliant stuff.
Coldplay's my favourite band so I thoroughly enjoyed your a cappella to fix you
Bravo
That gap Ben ollied - OMG!   As a skate-rat from the 90's, I have so much respect for that.
These charities seem kind of ineffectual and pointless. Great video, but pissing money into charities which encourage homeless people to run (they aren't overweight they can barely afford food and get enough exercise just walking around) or not to carry knives (good in theory, but not carrying a knife didn't work for Jim...) seems like a waste.
Congratulations Tom and the team. Inspirational
wow! I'm ashamed to say i didnt think you could do it in that time crunch but I'm pleased you proved me wrong! you're truly an inspiration!
thats a soccer ball
proper good job mate
This was brilliant, Tom 🙂 Please do the same in Norway next summer
Legend! Loved both of these videos. You're a top guy.
Crazy what this man can do when he actually uses roads
AWESOME STUFF TOM !!!!
Incredible job! As always the videos came out great as well
What an amazing feat. Not the kind of content I expected from this channel years ago, but I love it. Can't wait to see what comes next.
Amazing effort and well done Tom & the crew! A thrill and a spirit lifting joy to watch. And proof once again that if you've got a Verity on your side - anything is possible! 🙂
her: he's cheating on me meanwhile, him: 25:09
Fukkin well dun bruv
Truly incredible. Well done Tom and crew!
Just stellar.  Simply Thank you for your dedication to such a noble cause and also to the inspiration and entertainment you provide in these shitty old times we find ourselves in.  You’re a legend.
Idea: Flying a drone across the country?
Now do it again but doing keepy ups the whole way
30:44 The bridge is actually covered in Kittywake shit, not Seagull shit! They all live in the old lift shaft, and there was a famous illegal rave in there once.
Just heard the news, no white males at all in your country leadership. They wonder why males need psychological help, why did Brexit happen, its because of UK males feeling desperation. I am glad you are here to show the world that native males can do incredible things still. Its hard to get up every day when you know everyone looks down upon you, wishes you were dead or gone. Its hard when its cloudy, you have no friends, you would find it easy to just end it all. Its a fatherless generation man. You need to take care of your boys, discipline them and reinforce them, make a next generation we can be proud of, that is what I pray to do, make more people like GeoWizard. If my son was like you I would be proud. Boris Johnson kind of sucked but bloody hell... did it need to come to this?  I hope UK Men can figure something out, its imperative for your country's future, hopefully through mental health groups and services and brotherhood of men together, we can turn around our beleaguered gender's fates.
Absolutely unbelievable effort, from all of the team involved. What an incredible video. The cause, the execution, second to none. Inspirational. Amazing content, so immensely proud of you Tom and everyone involved in this video, speaking for your entire fan base. Amazing.
I remember seeing the video about this challenge, and then reading the comments and seeing that most people were doubting the challenge and telling you to not do it. Yet you still pushed through, gave it a cracking good go, and proved that it’s possible! What an absolute inspiration!!
Well done
Legend well done.
Congrats Tom and crew!! Amazing!
Aw no custom subtitles
Well done
Incredibly awesome video! Thank you so much for sharing this, it was a joy to watch!
Thats not a football thats a soccer ball
Russ at the end looking like he could run back
cant believe you didnt go to the beach
Amazing video! Congratulations to everyone and well done for raising so much money.  We need to see Russ on a straight line mission! What a character (perhaps no loud music through the farmers fields though)
Inspirational lads. Thanks
I love Doombar. It tastes like ice cream.
I doubted you mate,  but you did it with hours to spare. Incredible achievement, well done man
That low blood sugar thing? Oh yeah I had that happen pretty quickly when I was out of shape, been training like crazy and it doesn't happen that soon to me.   If you could run as long as you did before hitting low, I'm not even sure you can train to last longer. But unlike you I ride my bike alone so fainting would be much more "fun" if it happened to me. It's interresting that your body can tell you stop or die.  Also how the hell you run 118km with a friggin ball and not collapse on spot?
That brought tears to my eyes, after a tough year, seeing you running through Britain through pain and doing it to bring awareness and help people struggling of mental health issues is just beautiful. You're a top lad Tom, hope you get a good rest and enjoy some time with your loved ones before diving back into work too fast. Keep it up you legend!
well done, mate!
Can we all just appreciate, that Tom not only uploads quality content, where he does simply impossible things, being an inspiration to over a million people, he also spreads awareness for those who need it and at the same time he puts like 3 YouTube ads in a 40min video! I have been so frustrated lately with all the creators spamming their videos with ads, Tom really saves the joy of watching YouTube! Cheers from Austria mate!!
7:35 getting SF:UR vibes - one of my favourite GTA San Andreas radio stations
loved the video, glad you were with people to suport you during this one, also, noticed your music during it, and i can't say how much i like your 8bit ambiant
beautiful, just beautiful!
Did Tom know they were driving on the wrong side of the road the entire time?
Thanks for showing me that i need desperately to visit Hadrian's wall.
Incredible. wow!
well done mate, fantastic effort!
Mate, that‘s what I call entertainment! Can‘t wait for the next ridiculous thing you come up with!
The GOAT 🐐
congratulations! loved following along with you guys through these videos. what a feat!
Dunno if he switched editing software, but using headphones the audio is pretty terrible, as if the audio bitrate setting on export from his editing software was set waaay too low. Sounds like a 96kbps MP3 with compression artifacts galore, especially during talking and anything with "S" sounds :(  edit: not talking about wind noise
Well done. 10 mile from the coast
I really think you should get better quality food for your next adventures.
What an amazing team!!! Russ is so motivational, I need a Russ in my life!!! Well done all!
Next do an egg and spoon walk across scotland or something 😂😂
Happy the bird has a new home
Brilliant effort 9/10, brilliant couple oh video’s, you excelled yet again, can’t wait till the next missions.   Only reason I gave 9/10 was the it’s coming home tune
"what felt like 10 minutes was literally 40" Great way to sum up this video Tom!
incredible from start to finish what an achievement
That's it. That's your best video. And that's now your support crew. That was unbelievable. You're nuts. You're actually crazy. And brilliant. I've been a fan for a while and I think this will take some beating. Also, do you write poetry? I wrote this one down "As the blood red colours of the deep early hours began to garnish the night sky". Touch of class.
boring
I'm a bloke in the late 50s. And for most of my life 'depression' has been one of those matters that just need to be overcome by willpower and positive attitude. And that's despite my father going through depression when I was in my late 20s. It's really in the last 10-15 years I've come to come to understand it more.   Sure over the years I've had times when I've felt a bit 'down', but it's not lasted more than a few hours or day at most.   A couple of weeks ago I sent through several days where I just felt nothing - it wasn't even negative thoughts - it like I had no emotions. I tried to put it down to a number of factors, which I won't go into here, but I got to point of looking up the Samaritans. I started to feel better after 4 days, and so there was no point taking it further. Whether that was depression I don't know, and if it comes back perhaps I will seek help.   I'd like to think I'm generous with charities, but thinking about it none of those I support are about mental health, so I've made a contribution to Tom's Justgiving page. Let's smash the £50K - and go on to £100K!
Don't know why but i thought you'd start in the Scottish highlands and end in cornwall or something
i will never kill myself thank you tpm
Another incredible video Tom. Congratulations, and thank you so much for sharing your journey.
I didn’t see a football anywhere in this video. Did you mean a soccer ball?
Congratulations Tom and everyone involved!  What an awesome achievement!
@geowizard is there any way of emailing you? I'd really like to speak to you about doing a charity event. I'd like to know how you planned and got things together. It's for a good cause as my mum had a disease called PSP. She unfortunately died last month. She always wanted to do this event but never got around to it so I'd like to pick your brains and have a talk about it.
I'm surprised ur ball wasn't booted in Newcastle
Congrats!
This is my favourite thing you've ever done mate. Congrats
Okay, now kick the football all the way back again.
What song is at 24:20
why
Inspirational ❤️
I’m a long distance runner too, and this was amazing to see! So great how you pushed through the entire night
common W als always Tom
Amazing!
even the bird won this time
Were you getting your electrolytes back during those van breaks? I'd definitely be sipping the salty water mix
38:35
Best team ever including yourself, outstanding result
Incredible. Good work, Tom. Can't wait to see your next adventure!
Unbelievable fair play!
Great effort team. Next time in a straight line please 😝
This was an incredible video and crazy idea well done Tom! Also everyone needs a friend like Russ, my man was so inspiring and uplifting <3
Legend.
The cumbrians are proud to have supplied as many staircases as we could
I find it pretty funny that this video gets about one quarter of the views of just sitting in a chair playing Geoguessr. The effort to views ratio is wayyy off 😁
y'all need that 1 flashlight which lights up your entire surroundings for these night walks 😂
Phenomenal work!
Points for kicking a soccer ball but the title said football
Good bloke!
You are in great shape performing this feat
That’s a soccer ball…
Tom ♥ The Team ♥
I couldn't have liked this video anymore if I tried. What an amazing group of friends
Can’t believe he actually did it. So amazing
Congrats Tom! Well earned
Top effort mate! You did fantastically — what an achievement!
Mary Land!
What an absolutely mindblowing thing to accomplish, and to do it in the name of charity no less. Well done Tom! Cannot wait to see what mental thing you attempt next.  Also, glad to know that a record-holding ultramarathoner is also an enjoyer of Monster. I throw that in the face of anyone who's ever said they'll kill me!
I honestly thought this was impossible. So incredibly happy you proved us cynics wrong... I am inspired and freaking proud of you mate. Donating now, cheers!
Combining the best sports and the worst country, interesting. I'll subscribe for the summersault. Just to clarify I am still racist against the British. Gz, Red Bull is the best energy drink.
Stick to what you are good at. this is not it.
Eh, they cheated it
ridiculous shots of the sun coming up. love watching these types of series! awesome job mate!
Witnessing greatness 😁
fake
What a beast
Yank here. It's pronounced less like Mary-Land and more like Merryl-End.
Long experience and good planning can beat nearly anything. If it felt anything near easy it's because you've trained not only specifically for this but in the half dozen straight line missions you've done and who knows what else on and off camera. You are basically a world expert in this sort of thing now.
What a gem of a find your channel is. Found you from your geoguessr videos and then these challenge videos are so good. Can't wait to see what insane idea comes next.
Love this stuff! Keep it up
Another unreal adventure, congrats Tom!
there are endless words to describe how incredible this feat is, you’re insane. the amount of mental preparation and execution is unprecedented. there is NOTHING like your commitment.
Brilliant. Well done. Adventure idea: hike from the top of mainland Scotland to the south of England. Or vice versa
Well done' this is some next level endurance. Both you and your support crew has done and incredible job. A massive congratulations to you all.
The homosexual tension is real
Good mates
this was absolutely WILD to watch, what a delight!!! and after everyone in the comments thought it unlikely!!
The fact your camera guy made it so far without throwing up having not done anything like this before is impressive to be honest. Fair play to the lad. Looking forward to the next adventure!
There's something about the way GW commentates that I'm always expecting the next thing to be a disaster but I'm really glad you guys all made it, what an achievement! Keep that ball forever!
Congrats Tom! Great stuff. What commitment!
Amazing Tom!! Great achievement, perfect story telling as you always do! Thank you for sharing, performing and beating this challenge
This is what life is about
Ngl, when I first hear you say "dribble", I thought it meant "basketball-style", and now I am ashamed to have underestimated you, and amazed at the same time.
Absolutely mental, mate!
amazing mate
honesly never thought you could do it. thought it a crazy fever dream that would end after a few miles with a broken foot...congrats to the team. absolutely insane. I am so impressed and happy for you all
I'm just imagining them 1/2 km from the finish line and Peter Kay come out of nowhere and boots the ball "Have it!"
great race for some great causes!! well done tom!!!
You're a great man Tom, thanks for all of this.
Not just entertaining but for worthy causes. Well done all of you, amazing 👍💪
Ran 1.5 mi the other day after a few month break.... totally broke me off Used to do 5-7 a few times a week and now 1.5 had me collapsing when I got home  This guy, 70 miles in does somersaults like its no big deal, absolutely impressive
I definitely had my doubts about it when you announced this so I'm blown away by everyone. I hope you've all recovered well. What incredible causes to support and I hope you've inspired at least 1 person to speak up if they're struggling.
19:00 the fueling need is real. Probably need at least 6,000 calories for that effort. Probably more.
Coming from Germany, the left lane driving still always scrambles my brain when watching these videos :)    Anyway,  great entertainment again as always ^^  And Congratz to finishing like a pro, from a longtime watcher !   And cheers up for your great support Crew !
As an american working in construction, I drive 3 hours every day for work. So wild to me how small the UK is
Casually walks over ancient Roman wall, Brits are wild man.
Beautiful, Tom!
Well done! You’ve done it!
What an incredible journey Tom, congratulations!
Congratulations Tom, you're so inspirational, thank you! I love your adventures, keep on going mate.
Fair play mucker, that was an epic journey!
Man... Props to your camera guy. His first long run and he kept up the entire way, that's the really impressive part.
Yo ur insane dude
Well done lad can’t think of anyone else who would do this 👍👍👍👍
That’s a soccer ball mate.
Fair fucking play Tom, you literally are an inspiration to many. Keep it up fella, great effort for a cause I think we've all known, some closer than others, but we've all know it somehow.
Omg this is super random but anyone else notice Tom looks EXACTLY like Stinson Hunter?
CAM ON INGERLAND
You know they built that wall to keep us out right  while they enslaved yous  😛🤣 we were to mental for the romans another great episode and no idea what you going to do next rivers in a canoe straight challenge ?
These videos never disappoint
Congrats for dribbling Britain Tom. Thanks for supporting great causes to charity. Keep up cheers for you, Charity and the crew as well.
Watching from a different Newcastle "ɹǝpun uʍop", congratulations!
Holy shit, moving, nice one dude
What a video
wish Stan didn't edit this, bet there was loads cut out of him being a little winge bag 😂
Incredible work Tom.
Epic
Good
I think he means a soccer ball.
So glad this was a victory! And without any qualms that anyone could raise up against its success at that. Love these missions/adventures
An inspiration mate, thank you so much.
Now you got to walk across the US, that'd be the ultimate challenge
It's called a soccer ball, doesn't he even know?
get in, tom, well done.
Congrats just amazing work is all I can say
Tom, you truly are a legend. Your videos are as inspiring as funny to watch. Please keep up the great work. You keep refueling my love for the outdoors even in tough times.
Your country is tiny.
Way to go, Tom!
Now do the USA! haha
I didn’t think it would happen, and I’m quite happy to be proven wrong.
Grats, specially to the cameraman
Congratulations, Tom! This was such a joy. The inviting, unique, personal style you’ve developed in these videos deserves to be celebrated. They prove that online video has as much to offer as anything in legacy media.
It’s mad seeing you run past Riverside 😂 had many pissed nights in that club over the years! Great job lad, cracking effort
fucking amazing
30:06 that killed me 😂
brilliant as always guys!!
I Still can't believe that no dogs ran out on you and grabbed it!
Class Tom, Russ is an absolute legend! Need to see a straight line mission with Russ!!!
Congrats Tom, from France!
Congrats
You reakky shook the pillars of heaven, Tom
Really amazing and inspirational Tom, and the crew was awesome. Mad props to the camera guy for running so much beyond his previous longs, I’m inspired by him too, and reminded that so much of running (and life) is about not setting limits on yourself. Way to go everyone, including Verite for those long hours and much needed support!
Excellent stuff mate, well done! You're getting rather good at this adventuring lark! :)
Caught off guard getting emotional with you completing the task. I admire your positivity on life and other people. What a great achievement, great support group and most importantly a great cause. Well done!
What an amazing video, seriously mate
Well done to all!
Absolute fuckin mental, fella! Mad impressive stuff... really are a true inspiration!
This was outstanding, felt like I was there with you all the whole time. Great set of videos, really. Can't wait for the Eastern US tour!
Congratulations Tom!
Russ is such a lad
STAY positive with Sherpa 🐕♥️😇😜😝😛💯🇬🇧💖😋😏☺️🙏
What an absolute madman. You are a legend.
Can anyone tell me the epic song that's playing at 33:50 thanks
You are a true legend!
amazing video!! congratulations on making the trip :)
You’re a legend! Interesting, intelligent and physical fit as a fiddle! Thanks for the content 🤟🏼
Stupid question, amazing journey but wouldnt it be a better idea to consume complex carbs consistently throughout the day? Like oats and so, so you don't get those sudden energy spikes and drops by relying on sugar to get energy?  Love the videos Tom, I'm so invested in these hahah
wish that belledn with the ginger moustache would leave him alone ffs
L E G E N D
Tom mate did I hear some new music you've made? 30:41
Tom, I am elated after watching this video. Goosebumps for the last few minutes. Such a fantastic record of an incredible journey. It's probably the best content I've seen on YouTube so far this year, and I've watched a lot. Congratulations to you and the team on achieving this, and good on you for raising money and awareness for mental health and knife crime. I work in mental health and will always big-up anyone who fights the good fight and spreads the good word. Much love 💚
A certain footballer kicked his cat further than that, and in a much faster time!
Birb was my favorite guest character of this series     congrats!
What a fuckin legend
doing nature stuff like this in the night /early morning hours has a pretty epic feel to it??? i did a sundown-to-sunrise bike ride once and biking along an empty road when the mist starts clearing and the sun goes up is just a weirdly epic feeling
Congrats!
I can't believe how non-fucked you were at the end of this. You must be insanely fit :'D. Congrats
Best channel on YouTube
Loved the video! Having the squad with you was a great idea.  I can't believe how much energy your bearded friend had the entire trip, I want him on every trip I go on
Who on earth would dislike this?
Yeah the road from Heddon on the Wall down towards the river is pretty brutal! Many congratulations - a quite ridiculous physical achievement. Well done!
ggwp Tom
Unbelievable job Tom! Well done and for a great cause
This journey has been amazing to follow. Tom you're an inspiration for everyone that stumbles across your videos! A quick advice on the downhill parts of the endeavour: if you kick it uphill you can walk or jog downhill and the ball will eventually come back to you, of course you'd have to turn your back to check the ball status and be sure to not let it surpass you and obviously be precise to let it stay on the lane but it's much easier than downhill kicking, this is said from years of experience going to the local playing ground without ever using the hands to  bring the ball!  Anyway thanks again for sharing this experience with us, keep doing your thing! Tonight I'll raise my beer for you from the little bar of my little hometown in northern Italy 🇮🇹
Incredible
Absolutely incredible. Great job Tom.
Congrats Tom!
This has to be the only upload on youtube which will never get a downvote. As i'm short on funds atm no donations have been made, yet. it's all noted down for when I can. Inspiring story, and great execution, would have  been at the bridge if I lived remotely close and not in a different country. Keep up encouraging me and all viewers to start adventuring and pushing yourself!
touch heatmap would look mad after this 🔥
I was only watching for the crow
well done mate
Love your adventures. Thanks!
loved every minute of that.
Russ: Mad respect and inspiration 😲 Jim: 😢💜 Jack: Good lookin' out for everyone's health ⚕ Cameraman Stan: Amazing endurance and beautiful buttery smooth gimbal shots while running 🎦 Verity: An amazing helpmate; Tom couldn't do it without you! 💞 Love friends supporting each other's goals through Life!
Goosebumps mate. From sitting in a room playing GeoGuessr, to raising over £40k through running over 100km across britain with a football in under a day. What an inspiration you are mate. Absolute legend.
“That’s a welcome sign”… because it’s a welcome sign
Absolutely mental that you managed to accomplish this! Congratulations.
What a great adventure.! Well done all of you! ⚽️
Unreal effort from everyone involved! Congratulations 🙌🥳
Congrats!
Such a great video idea
I reckon I've said that with all the luck I wished you, you'll not be able to do it 😅. I'm so glad you've proven us it possible, great journey mate, keep going!
Congratulations! Well Done!
Congrats
I wish I could donate but I cant
Well done Tom!
What a legend, you truly are Britain's Forest Gump 🤣
I can't believe how easy you made this look. I know it was tough, but you and your team smashed it. Epic.
Now we need straight line, no roads and kicking the ball combined in one mission.
My heart was in my mouth watching that final mile with all the stepovers next to that big drop..! Massive congrats on an absolutely ridiculous achievement!
This is insane mate. Absolutely love it. And besides the achievement of this insane challenge, it's such a well produced documentary too. Perfect shit!
what an amazing job by the whole crew and for such an inspirational journey. well done mate.
Thanks for the musical intermezzo AND the return of the quest music!
Honestly amazing. Well done all you guys and for what you are doing for the charities. Proper amazing.
tom mate. absolutely fucking mad. never thought you would achieve this in a million years, absolutely stunned. chucked in a tenner, struggled with very severe mental health my entire life and shit like this means alot. to many more
Amazing effort Tom! 😄
Smashed it mate, well done from 🇦🇺.
Congratulations! with all of my heart, you are making a difference Tom, thank you so much !!
Great job I almost can't believe you can run for so long. When I walk around 20 to 30 km I already feel my legs hurting a lot haha.
mate...that was a pretty good cartwheel
That was neat.
Properly, properly, absolutly properly impressive! Very nice from the fans/interested to actually show up, nice gesture!
You might want to mute the Queen part for rights reasons considering the record labels are absolutely insane in regarding those things.
Good on you Tom, well done! Looking forward to the next challenge!
This was amazing. Great job, Tom & team! Thrilled that you did it and beyond excited to see what comes next! <3
So excited to settle in for 40 minutes of cross country footie
"An inspiration" is an understatement.
Said it before and I'll say it again - you all are legends
Honestly can’t believe the mad shit you pull off. Congratulations.
And that's why humans are apex predator.
Top effort mate, amazing and inspiring!
big up mate
Crazy Achievement
Support crew were fantastic. Makes me wonder if having a similar crew for straight line would make a big difference. Maybe penciling in on the hedge crossings, to supply and encourage. I also lose my appetite with heavy exercise and it does kill me - although I would have been killed before the 20km mark!
A clean victory! - What a journey!
Straight to the pub, what a champ
Smashed it
Massive job, Tom. Congratulations!
You can never go wrong with Sir Duke. Injects energy and optimism into any situation. That aside, what another tremendous feat Tom, and what a team. You deserve massive respect for plugging the issues you're supporting and helping to plug a gap created by decades of underfunding of mental health and youth work support.
SLAAAAVES
it's wild how much faster you can cross a country when you do the whole thing on a path intended for it instead of traipsing through farms, forests, and folks' backyards 😆
This is great work!! As a tip (that you probably don't need, but eh) if you ever do something like this again you should look into snacks for long-distance cyclists! They make a lot of energy-dense gummies and bars and stuff like that, super helpful for stuff like this!
Hello everyone,wish you a blessed day,if someone wanna heel there soul ,I have a video for you with a beauty of my Asian village https://youtu.be/y9yUZjpQrIc🤗🤗
absolutely legendary. That was a mental task to take on but you did it so much better than I could've imagined.
Time to finally conquer wales with that support team?
Incredible! What a journey man
Inspirational. Thanks for this.
Comment for the algorithm everyone needs to see these videos
I've gotta admit, I was one of the naysayers who believed this wasn't possible in 24 hours. How wrong I was. What a legendary team.  Looking forward to hopefully seeing another go at the Scotland straight line mission, because that... that is a truly near-impossible beast!
top stuff here tom and fair play, would've been too tempted to roberto carlos that ball 60 yards into a field
absolute best thing on this platform. I was waiting for this to come out and your story telling and sense of adventure is incredible! Congrats on your finish!! well deserved
Awesome mission Tom, really enjoyed it! Can't wait for the next one! Really enjoyed the whole team in the videos too! Hopefully they can all join you in another series :)
Most physically demanding challenge and the one who was completed the most flawless way. Just to show the power of preparation and comradery.
I’m happy for you bud. You did it! Cheers from Canada 🇨🇦🇬🇧
Petition for Tom to release a satnav voice over 🤣 the long journeys would be much more enjoyable
I hop in and out of watching your vids, I'm super glad I stayed subbed and watched this series. Wonderful
Lol, naming US states to pass the time. I never heard of this and I live in the US. Good shit,like the content!
That was incredible!
cried at the end, thank you Tom
25:25 when it suddenly transitioned from you all singing to your usual channel music, I thought you'd decided to blast your own theme music for a bit 😂
Fuck me, you actually did it!
Congrats!! You're an inspiration!!
congratulations mate! hope to see you doing more adventures with that crew!
Your content is absolutely top-tier mate. Keep up the good work
congrats tom!
Mate this is it. Fair play what an amazing video
Tom u legend!! U r such an incredible man, this challenge was so toughh but so good to watch and i am over the moon with how it all went for u! Congratulations, cant wait to watch the next adventure! U r an inspiration man!
I have nothing else to praise about this that hasn't already been said by other comments. You are amazing Tom, never stop
I genuinely can't put into words how inspiring and heart warming this is. Congratulations mate this is absolutely amazing.
AND HE MADE IT LOOK EASY!
You are a real inspiration man. Love your videos. Really, huge inspiration.
Harry Maguire tried to beat your record but couldnt be bothered, says having more than one touch of the ball causes headaches.. ;)
Impressive displays of talent, strength, and good nature from all involved!
Unbelievable effort man, well fucking done! Doing us brits proud!! What a proper inspiration you are, well done again!!!
i just realised this is basically in the spirit of jon bois' 17776: football taken to such extremes that games transcended the football field and became country-wide matches
congrats tom! loved this challenge and thanks to variety for supporting you
Love this video, amazing work from the whole team and great cause, keep at it man!
Great job Tom! This was an extremely satisfying mini series
This is the best video I have seen in a long time. It is content like this that makes film making worth it. You are an inspiration.
Congratulations, and seriously well played Tom and the whole team. Chucking a few quid your way now.
man's gonna fukkin summit everest eventually, goddamn
Well done sir. I'm really impressed both by the physical/mental feat and your dedication to raising awareness for those charities. Keep it up!
Amazing
Hey Tom, great adventure! Really enjoyed it, cheers
Great job man
Hands down the best creator on YouTube. You’re an inspiration Tom!
Above and beyond. Brilliant effort, all. ❤‍🩹
honestly thank you for the bird update at the end. love your videos so much! you continue to surprise me in having such funny, engageable content that always brightens my day :)
Congrats, what a great achievement for a great cause.
Waited for both of the videos to be out and to have the time to watch both at once. Very well worth it. Congrats Tom and team!!
That low blood sugar is called hyperglycaemia, and it’s something I dealt with throughout childhood. It’s bloody weird.
What is that "adventure food" you ate?
Mate I really loved this. I live vicariously through you. Watching these adventures really inspires me to challenge myself a new watching the camaraderie between you is lovely to see. I really hope you keep doing these adventures. They’re inspiring and cathartic to watch. Your classic English bants is a joy and so nostalgic. Thanks Tom!
wow, what a mission. I can understand why you took the support crew you did with you!! what a team!!! I've seen all your vids, but didn't see this one coming off, but well bloody done for you doing it!!! Big up the black country!!!!!!
If you’ve never watched Courtney daulwater ultra marathons and her nutrition then I’d highly recommend. Cracking effort Tom
What a story, what a legend! Your team was and IS incredible! Appreciate how much they support you ☺️
Thank you, Tom. You are an inspiration to everyone.
Congrats!
I hate soccer as much as your next australian. But that was a bloody epic epic adventure mate!
Well done mate. That is crazy. btw you must have filled with stingynettle when you were done.
What a masterpiece
Massive respect to you Tom, as well as your insane team! It is incredibly humbling to see everyone come toghether for this amazing achievement. Well done, truly!
What an amazing accomplishment Tom. I must admit to being one of those who expressed doubts and genuine concerns when you first brought this up , but you have succeeded, and with two great videos and not to mention raising awareness to amazing charities. Great stuff.
This was inspiring and entertaining. You are doing amazing things, both on and off “the field” as it were. Cheers to an amazing job well done from an old guy in the States. I came because of Geoguessr. Little did I know how much more there is to you, this channel, and the message you bring to the world. Thank you, Tom, for letting us be a part of your amazing adventure and generosity.
Huge congrats to you Tom and the rest of the team! There’s nothing you can’t do!
You handballed it at the first dunk need to start it again 😂😂
You should have ate fresh fruits would give you way more energy and hydration.
Mate unbelievable! Your content is by far the best on YouTube! I recently walked 85km and it took me 30 hours! The fact you did considerably more than this, whilst kicking a football is insane! Good work and can't wait for the next mission!
Congratulations Tom and your team great work and such a inspiration to a lot of people well done
Incredible, well done!
Congratulations!
LETS GO!
Can we follow you on strava or do you keep that private?
fucking love it
♥
What an amazing achievement. Well done to you and the team. Fantastic effort.
That’s amazing
Wow! That is something else. Congratulations gents, really worthy causes and you've inspired me, I can't run but I'll go walk it some day!
absolute legend xx
What a massively feel good ending to a brilliant mission video.
It is pretty wild how much exercise can improve your mental state. Glad to see charities related to getting people active so they can start to improve themselves.
Such a top job Tom and crew! I honestly wasn't sure if you would make it in 1 attempt but fair dues. This is incredible and I appreciate what you did this for.
Legend'
Goated
What a champ!
Well done Tom!
The fact that my first instinct upon hearing "knife crime" is to laugh tells me how completely diseased America is.  "Knife crime"  UK: a rising problem that ruins young lives  US: lol that's baby stuff, our kids have assault rifles
I stood up from my chair and unironically gave you a one-man applause in my room for 2 minutes... You're such an inspiration. I remember watching your videos when you were at 40k or 50k subscribers, doing nothing but geoguessr. Seeing you do all these insane challenges and supporting people in need by raising money is amazing and very inspiring... Way to go Tom, congratulations!!!!!!
Tom you absolute legend
Congrats guys, truly an amazing achievement.
100% Legend - That's all i can say!!
Well done! Next you have to do a vertical line 😂
Awesome job mate! You are an absolute legend and such an inspiration
that acapella was beautiful you guys should form a band
Commenting here to help the algorithm
This man is insane. I've never met him, yet I feel like I've known him for years. Mad respect, lad.
well fucking done to you and everyone what a remarkable challenge xxx
Absolutely brilliant pal! You smashed it
Legendary!
Fantastic
Proud as hell man. Get in tom, you're an inspiration. Cheers from Ohio
Congratulations Tom. That was Brilliant. 😁👍
Your footie skills have certainly improved since the Norway mission
Fantastic! Great production.
Legend.
Insane
Amazing job! And just another comment for the algorythm
Loved the Sir Duke moment, I’ve finally learnt the song on the bass guitar!
'I feel like N'Golo Kanté after 66 minutes'  😂😂😂😂
Thank you Tom for the inspiration and lifting the spirits. I only recently discovered your channel and you are already one of my favorite and dearest youtubers. Congratulation on the mission, I almost cried at the end, it was such a happy moment. Cant wait for the next mission, keep up the good work.
That is extremely heartbreaking to hear about James Brindley. This was all for such an amazing cause which makes the success so worth it, congrats. Unfortunately knife crime is surprisingly worse in the US even though we have guns, truly awful human nature.
Big congrats Tom and the Crew - amazing! I thought this would be impossilbe, but not only did you do it, you actually made it look piss easy. ⚽👍🥳
Send Sonny to the National football museum!
Think this might be my first ever comment on a youtube vid. Wow so awesome Tom, you and the crew absolutely rock and the cause is just impossible to not get behind. You are a legend mate.
Amazing, Tom! I love your adventures. I raise my glass in salute. Skål!
Not a dry eye in sight! Tom you are a credit to our species. Verity, Stan, Ben and Russ and any one else in the team well bloody done you did this just as much as Tom, without you this wouldn't have happened! Honestly thought it wasn't possible but as usual Tom makes the impossible possible, and in a way that we all know with the right attitude, training and effort we could achieve this too, not the first time I've said but Tom you are an inspiration, and a credit to the area my English family come from. You've reached your goal but I will more than happily pledge to you and your lost brother! ❤️
Absolutely phenomenal
congrats mate
Congratulations Tom, amazing achievement for worthy causes 👍👏👏👏
Hey Tom. First of all congratulations on this massive achievement! But man... Just wanted to let you know that like 15 years ago when I played football in the youth teams we actually had a coach that made us run through the forest with the ball. He always said this was great for learning to control the ball, but for us it was so annoying... Dribbling over roots, stones and downhill was awful. So I can feel want you went through. Keep the great content coming!
Well done on a fantastic win!!
Congrats mate, you all smashed it. That bird at the end was the perfect conclusion. Or epilogue, should I say.
Hey Tom, just wanna say gz on an amazing achievement. I've suffered from depression for the second time in my life for the past seven years straight, so I appreciate you pushing important causes.
Love this guy
Well In Tom through all the doubt people had you managed to do it with hours to spare.  You’re an inspiration, thanks Tom.
Beautiful. You and the crew are a massive inspiration to so many. Gonna have to test out this rum and monster for myself.  Well done all.
Amazing. Utter legends all of you!
You did it. You actually went and DID IT mate! That was glorious and my gosh you are fit! Wow! Congrats!
If only Hadrian was here to see this, he'd think you're insane
Cheers for deing it for us Geordies! We de so appreciate it!
what an absoulutely incredible feat mean. <3 congratulations!
What an achievement, very commendable.
That is an absolute monster of an effort, Tom. I left quite an honest yet supportive comment on your original "why I'm doing this" video, saying that it's amazing how both depression and the way out of depression hits people so differently, as the stuff that's worked for you just hasn't worked for me at all, and I mentioned how glad I was that you found your way out of it.  This video really is heroic, I don't want to say inspirational as there's no way anythings going to inspire me to go and do even 1% of what you've done here, but as someone who's come through a suicide attempt and still really struggles 5 years after it, seeing someone who's been through what is still an under appreciated and misunderstood illness, and to come out of it and do something as brutally challenging as what you've done here is quite unbelievable. And it couldn't happen to a nicer bloke either.   I know I'm just another fan, but I'm proud of you mate.
you're an absolute legend, such an inspiration
embarrassing
Honestly what a journey, well done man. Absoloutly loved this.
This is truly one of the best things I have ever watched. The absolute dedication, emotion and vulnerability portrayed in the past two videos have been incredible. I was fully crying at the end, feeling as if I was right there with you celebrating! Incredible thing you have done, Tom. The best yet! This community is so incredibly proud of you and your team, thank you for shedding some light to areas and communities that need it. You are a legend!!! 🤟🏻
100% wholesome!
Well done for proving me wrong. I never thought this was possible. I thought it would need to 2 days at least. What an impressive achievement to all involved.
truly a british ending to the trip if I ever saw one
Amazing video, amazing journey and for an amazing cause!
I love everything about this but the team spirit really made me melt. Such a sweet group of people, it even looks like you've all been friends for years and everyone looks dedicated as fuck. Honestly this is the adventure of a lifetime and a huge inspiration to so many people, as it hopefully will be to everyone helped by the donations! Congratulations!
Waaaaait wait wait wait... I live in Heddon on the Wall.. you didn't even go to the only bit of the wall there still standing lol
Jees, these guys are really fit.
amazing
What an absolute legend. Well done and congratulations on this amazing achievement, to you and the entire support crew!
class work tom, unreal
What a great video. Your support crew was the best you can get. Nice of them to help you through this challenge.
amazing
Well done Tom and Crew. As batty as ever. Keep it up. Happy to have donated to your well championed cause.
Haven't really watched your straight line missions but this was amazing. Only thing I missed is, did you have a second dunking by the bridge or only the first one? Or did you at least meggs the bridge ;)
A seriously big round of applause! What an achievement! I'm almost envious of you, from your award winning team, to the killer sunset and all the laughs you had along the way, such a unique and well earnt feeling that must be. Hope you took plenty of time to recover, and I look forward to the next batshit crazy idea you come up with! :D x
Superb effort! I'm pretty sure most of us were shouting 'Wilson' before it was actually said :)
I just love the fact you said "oh that's a welcome sign" about a literal welcome sign
Absolutely immense! Well done Tom and to you all, what a great team!
genuinely inspiring and motivational, man. Thank you for this!!! much love from Canada! Congrats :) :)
Absolute madlads. Gongrats!
nice
Absolutely brilliant mate, well done!
Tom, you're an inspiration!
Tom is an absolute chad and a real inspiration for me. Thank you for doing this
this content really sucks. I just want to see you play the damn video game. This is just lame
Such an achievement - amazing! Congratulations!
dude that cartwheel was smooth as fuck
Grats Tom! You've inspired me to take up long distance running again! 🤟
It's good you had someone with nutritional expertise. Candies and sweets have zero micro-nutrients. Think of micro-nutrients as your bodies equivalent oil and grease for a car. Without them the system grinds to a halt. Macro-nutrients are equivalent to the fuel.
What a fun journey. It was nice to see something that didn't involve any life threatening situations like drowning in a bog, haha. I loved seeing the fans casually saying hi throughout and at the end, what a wholesome way to end the mission :) Congratulations!
11:40 fuck that’s some beautiful writing man
Great job Tom!
Just gonna comment and like to boost engagement again, love the videos, hope thisll help
Brilliant. Further words escape mu. Just brilliant.
Next mission - Cycling the famed John 0 Groats - Lands End
A massive congratulations to you and your team, got quite emotional at the end there :)
Well done! I didn't think it would be possible but you all more than pulled it off. Respect!
Congrats Tom, top effort. I got quite emotional watching you cross the finish line to Fat Les.
Loved this bro. This makes me happy.
This was amazing to watch, thank you all!
24:50 33:25 are some definite highlights for me, incredible journey and props to ever single one of you ♥️
you should auction off the ball and donate the money!
What an amazing feat! I can't imagine what it must've felt like at the finish. If you ever plan on doing an adventure abroad, like in let's say the lovely Belgium, hit me up!  You've just motivated me to pick my life up again, and be more positive. Insane amount of respect and gratitude for you sir!
That bit with you guys singing "Fix You" by Coldplay made me teary-eyed. I have a lot of emotional ties to that song, but seeing it spread good vibes among you guys was just heartwarming. Congrats Tom and everyone else who pushed through this challenge.
That was awesome!
That's a soccer ball.. Honest mistake... You foreigners arent expected to know all of our ways and customs.
This was so cool!!! Hell yeah!!!!
time to do it the other direction now
£3.59 for a double monster and rum? In Newcastle? They're robbing you!
Congratulations Tom! You’ve built up an incredible, international fan base and I’m so happy to have been apart of your journey.
Congrats Tom! What an absolutely wicked journey that was. It was a pleasure to watch and an even bigger pleasure to support! Keep up the amazing work!
Absolutely mint as always Dave. Congratulations mate. Cormy completely terrible defending as always aswell.
Congrats brudda!
Massive fan of Tom but I would've confidently bet a large sum of money he was going to fail this monster of a challenge. Can gladly say I look like a right plonker now!
Turns out all of Tom's fans in Newcastle have one-syllable names.
Would love to see these guys more often
You make me believe I can actually do the crazy stuff I sometimes dream of doing. Cheers to a fenomenal effort!
What a legend. That is all I can say.
I feel the pain of the trying to eat something after getting no sleep through the night.Hunger with no appetite and feeling sick and exhausted, It's a horrible feeling. Good effort from you all.
I was one of the doubters beforehand but you just went and smashed it! Well done you absolute madlad!
wow!
love it
Great Job!!!!
Legend!
Honestly we need a recap video video now on the aftermath. I'm curious how long you slept after this. Congrats Tom, this was incredible
This is nothing short of amazing. Almost brings tears to my eyes seeing this. Found this channel just when you released the first wales episode a few years ago. Truly inspiring how this channel has grown and how you, Tom, has continued to do amazing things.    Get in my man.
Fuck this made me emotional as hell
Tom, you planning on uploading the full uncut journey?
24:25 slaves one of my favourite bands
Tom. Amazing. Well done mate!
This is absolutely amazing man! Congratulations Tom, and props to the crew too!
They always make jokes about cameramans surviving but you'r cameraman just made their jokes all look like a bad advices for the gigachad running with a camera!
The greatest dribbler in the world! Well done to Tom and all the crew, incredible journey for a great cause, thank you guys!
I like watching your content when I don't know if you will succeed or not. It really makes me root for you.
Are the subtitles embedded? Can't seem to be able to turn them off.
30:01 is that an orchestral "Three lions"? I love it!
Absolutely mental mate. This is one for the ages
Knocked it out of the park Tom. What a crew you had. Brilliant, absolutely magnificent.
Massive congrats Tom, what a journey. Every time I watch your videos it provides me with so much joy, and I cannot express how grateful I am to you.
Well done Tom, you're a bloody legend
Wow! Congratulations guys, what an achievement. Such an uplifting video for fabulous causes. I was feeling tearful at the end there.
imagine this is your limit breaker moment and you are suddenly an absolute ball bender
Didn't think this one would actually be possible. Congrats Tom! 💓
Absolute legend, mate. You're an inspiration
Madlad you are. <3
People in UK are fucking crazy😂😂 Good job mate🔥🔥
the other missions felt so dark and desperate at times and this one just feels so positive and hopeful. thoroughly enjoyed it and huge congratulations!
Such an amazing journey this was to watch. I absolutely loved this adventure, good job man.
well done on a succsesful and creative journey, look forward to the next one :)
loved it!
"I want a pint of guinness in a carling glass" is the most perfect explanation of "idgaf I want a drink" I've ever heard.
Mental achievement. Congratulations Tom.
well done like. smashed it. Its actually kittiwake shit on the tyne bridge close relitive to the common seagull
Fucking immense, what a hero
Congrats Tom! This was great to watch and absolutely buzzed to see you succeed!
Epic finish! The fact that you had energy to spare at the end to say hello to fans is amazing. Well done
Well done Tom - you smashed it. I never doubted you for a second (just ignore my doubting comment on the pre-run video)! Look forward to seeing you at an ultra sometime soon 😁 congrats to everyone involved too, a great team effort 🤘
So annoyed I woke up 2 hours after your arrival! would have been down to the river in a flash!
An incredible journey. It's been so amazing watching you transform from the first straight line mission to today, I remember subscribing back when you were a tiny channel and now you're over a million. Congrats.
ploppers
“Expectation is absolutely massive” Well done on your prep work, congrats
Commenting for the algo! Great job man, you did it!
GET IN!
What is with the Amynedd music? Do you know the artist? Love it but always wondered.
Congratulations you bloody legend!!! Thanks to all the support team!!
Amazing
Thank you Tom and the gang. That was a wonderful video.
Might the first youtube video that got me to cry at the end It’s amazing, congratulation !
Wooooooooo! Congrats, Tommy!
Nice
You are the biggest madlad of all time Tom, well done for proving most of us wrong and really helping people out in the process
Monumental was also the word that came to my mind AND for good causes to boot! Great support team, no spare ball needed, high spirits on the finish. Just an all around awesome run/adventure.
Superb tom!! Hahah absolutely superb man! Well done and incredible vid again!  Legend 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Listening to slaves at 24:40 lol
Listening to slaves at 24:40 lol
Never doubted in Bernardo Silva aka GeoWizard
What an inspiring journey and what an amazing group of people to accomplish this with! This makes me want to try walking the same path someday! Although, maybe not with a soccer ball 😅
Congratulations, what an absolutely incredible journey for such a great cause. Thank you so much.
props to Tom and everyone involved. Real legendary stuff
Congratulations mate.  You’re an inspiration.  Much love from Australia.
What an achievement. Great causes too. Well done man.
Well done Tom, amazing effort. Keep up the energy and diversity of ideas you bring to your videos.
Congrats mate, really well done! I thought for sure you were gonna be struggling way more due to having to constantly having to have fast feet to prevent the ball from rolling into a ditch. No problem when legs are fresh, but would be a nightmare (I thought) on tiresed legs after a couple of hours. But it seems like your legs help up really well. Awesome!
Love what you're doing mate
in the last minutes.... ffff...i'm not crying, YOU'RE crying!  Congratulations mate!
That's a solid 'Get in!' from me, well done to all involved
Brilliant
Wow what a journey, incredible achievement from all of you! Well done!
Well done, Tom!
Nice one mate
Well done dude! I didn't think you would make it. Smashed it.
I like how you have progressed from the first mission across wales to this, get in!
its so weird seeing newcastle in a video. ive never really been around newcastle properly but ive been there quite a bit and seeing the end point of the journey be under one of the places ive been countless times (the tyne bridge) is pretty wild. i guess its not too incredibly surprising but i dunno, i never see anything about the north east online, nevermind the few places ive been
Congrats!!! Incredible...
Seriously impressive
Get in Tom
cracking effort Tom! Keep up the amazing work you do
phenomenal effort. cameraman stan is the most impressive of all!
Well done Tom, you absolutely smashed it!
Congratulations Tom! Amazing challenge and amazing video as always. Props to your incredible support team, they were each the best for their job. Can't wait to see what you get up to next.
I'm so, so, so impressed by everyone in this video. Everyone came through, and honestly I cannot fathom WALKING that distance in that short of a time period, let alone trying to control a ball like that. I'd definitely have lost it in the woods or off a cliff at some point. The fact that you only used one ball and did it in way less time than you expected...is absolutely incredible. You are a true inspiration. Cheers!
Great job 🔥🤟👌💪
that was so cool ! Cheers Tom well done
You absolute madlads. Endless props. And worthy causes at that.
Abaolute madlad
Simply inspirational
Inspired👍
You are an absolute legend mate. Thank you for sharing the crazy journey and for helping others through charity. What an inspiring person you are.
genius or madman, I cant tell, but you're a f-ing legend mate!
The cameraman is da real mvp!
Absolute hero
Good fuckin job all of you. Good job to the cameraman for doing his first marathon like this, good job to literally one and especially you, Tom. Like the guy said, you are a fucking inspiration,man.
amazing videos and small point - but amazing job on the subtitles too!
I love you so much for these videos, such good vibes. Makes you happy to watch them. These videos are just as important of a job as charities are doing!
I don't really know how to put it into words but this is absolutely amazing and inspiring, by all of you involved.
Holy shit man. What an absolute belter. Big up all of ya.
Amazing effort from all of you, but I want to shout out the cameraman running his first marathon holding a camera in support of someone else's goal rather than for himself. Top effort!  Great skills from start to finish as well Tom!
Amazing! Congratulations mate, you are THE man!
All the scotland jibes makes me want to kill myself, this campaign has not worked 😞 😢
keep doing these man, they really motivate me to push myself more, i struggle with depression and it gives me so much hope that maybe this will make a real difference
What an adventure Tom, inspires a man to go out an make a difference in the world, cheers
He did it, the madlad really did it!
Absolutely amazing ! Well done Tom and crew - so inspiring
Are we recording?
Everyone seems to forget to ask this important question: was that a ghost poop?
i just donated to the James Brindley Foundation and i wanted to say that you're a bloody legend and i'm sorry for the loss of your best mate, his story really touched my heart and i appreciate everything you're doing from down under, I wish u all the best in your future endeavors
Well done mate!
Wow, what a journey this was 🤯 the ending nearly made me cry 😊
I'm so fucking proud of you all the way from Oregon, USA.
love the music choices! good mix of old and new.
Congrats to the whole team and especially Tom, brilliant idea perfectly executed, has very much inspired me to go on an adventure, can't wait for your next big idea
He tricked us again with that cliffhanger :( additional 10 miles? failure of the mission? are we doomed? stay tuned until the next episode. next episode: all good. I say "again" because I experienced the same in the last "one line" video :(
I love autistic mike skinner
This is one of my favourite things that I've seen on this website
That was nice.
I honestly still can’t believe he actually did it. Insane.
As if the end wouldn't be wholesome enough even the bird got a happy ending x3 Absolutely crazy journey with a great team ❤
I get Stan wasn’t available after dark and you runner guys had to film yourselves… but man just a stabilizer would’ve been massive
Congratulations Tom! I've been here since the early Geoguessr days, but your dedication and warmth in these videos convinced me that you're truly a top bloke. Cheers from Istanbul.
Incredible mate
Legends!
Immense. Such an inspiration mate. You’ve done so much for so many people, both from the awareness raised in this as well as your videos just giving us all something to look forward to. Can’t describe how much of an impact you’ve had on people.
Casual 100k cartwheel
This video is so wholesome and I love it 😻
This is called progress 💥🏆, this is what youtube should be full of!
unbelievable
Pint of Guinness in a Carling glass 😂
What a group of legends 😊
A surprisingly emotional watch! Huge congratulations, you worked so hard for this and it really shows! (If anything, it feels TOO smooth to be a GeoWizard trip...)
Two observations:  First, you aced this one. Good preparations, a great team around you, hardly any unforeseen circumstances, no injuries ... After the struggles of the straight line videos, it's great to see a mission go entirely according to plan.  And secondly, the storytelling. When everything goes according to plan, it is difficult to create an enticing story out of it. Unforeseen circumstances are intriguing, after all. Yet this was still told in a very exciting way. There were still "oh crap" moments, periods of lingering doubt, scary obstacles, and you really managed to portray what a challenge this was, even when things went relatively smoothly.   All in all, a great video. An achievement in multiple ways. Kudos to all involved!
Class video!
Phenomenal work Tom, probably your greatest YT achievement to date, inspirational really.
Great advert for Sondico. But most of all, well done Tom and the crew. Brilliant video and for a good cause also. Sad to hear about your friend Jim, but he'll be up there looking down laughing at you  when you slipped and fell on your arse!
You're a proper inspiration mate, honestly. I've got a few dreams I want to do, climb Ben Nevis, Snowdon, walk across the Cairngorms (not in a straight line), things like that. I'm waiting to see a cardiologist later today because I had some funny business with my ticker but after the surgery I probably need I'm hoping to get out and start working towards my goals. Seeing stuff like this makes me think I could actually do some of it.
I got teary-eyed at the end. There's a huge sense of community with this channel and you can see it with the people that came to visit Tom at the finish line and even the support crew. The amount of love and kindness there is with this community is great
To all the commenters saying Tom couldn't do it, why don't you go outside and touch grass some time. So many people think they know best, but they are sitting behind a keyboard with jack all life experience. Tom has proved, if there is a will there is a way.
Congrats Tom! You never fail to amaze with your videos, and this is another absolute grade A addition to the collection. An amazing feat you pulled off physically and raising tons of money for great charity’s while your at it. This is why your the best, hats off to you brother, keep up the good work
That was truly epic. Tom, congratulations 🥳 & to your amazing support crew.
Let's gooooooooo! Huge! <3
Not all heroes wear capes. That was brilliant lads and lady, congratulations mate x
Just imagine that lad at the end would've actually kicked the ball...probably into the river...
Theres a reason your my favourite youtuber. Absolute inspiration. Get in Tom.
You're an inspiration for us all! Cheers man
He went full Bernardo Silva! Get in!
19:12 as a diabetic, who sometimes accidentally injects too much insulin, I felt that
Remember all those people saying it couldn't be done?
You've brought me to tears Tom. I have no words
That ending was like a rocky movie lol
Insane effort from the whole team. Truly epic.
Phenomenal effort! What a great support crew. Well done everyone.
Absolutely emotional by the end of the video. Tom you've outdone yourself and absolutely smashed it. Big inspiration for me to get out and go on an adventure! Please never stop, my favorite YT channel and personality
Mate what a challenge, congratulations! Great for you to end it in our beautiful city of Newcastle (minus the bird 💩- the Kittywakes of the Tyne Bridge are actually protected that’s why it’s like that!). When watching your straight line videos I always thought Carlisle to Newcastle would be the best route for England but I guess going through a major city in a straight line would be impossible?! Who knows you could do it just north of the city and get to Blyth Beach??
Well played, Tom. Top shift.
Massive congratulations
Congrats! Well done Tom and the rest of the crew
nice
Fucking incredible and inspiring, congratulations
I thought your straight line missions, not to mention the black country adventures would be hard to top; but wow somehow you did it!  The combination of class banter and a team of great friends combined with the noble cause make this the best yet.  Top notch as always.
Technically, the coast was still quite a few kilometers away from when you ended... :)
I think it's obvious what your next mission should be now. Recreate the episode from Mr Bean where he plays mini golf and goes off course. Mini golf across a country.
Well done mate!
Congrats Tom and crew! Great effort!
That was amazing to watch, really inspiring! On your first mission across Wales, it seemed like you weren't that fit and as a runner myself I was a bit frustrated that  you didn't prepare yourself physically (at least that's what it seemed like :D). I never would have thought that running had been such an important part of your life for a long time, let alone that you would complete such a crazy challenge! I couldn't have done it as I totally suck at football. I'm sure you could do well in some long ultramarathon races if you'd wish to get into it.
This is a hell of a way to announce Bernardo Silva signing for Newcastle
Makes my walk through a park look like a walk in the park!
"Diverse assemblage of vibes" great vid
I know the Military Road. I cycle along there all the time and can confirm that some of those hills are fucking brutal!  You should have stuck to the Tyne as much as possible man. It's flat 😉
Truly inspiring. I'm going to keep sitting around not exercising and getting fat.
What a W, Tom
this is an incredible achievement, so proud of you and everyone involved in such an inspired adventure.
My mother's close friend and coworker was found hanging in the woods behind his house this morning. He left behind two children ages 11 and 8, and his wife. He'd been doing shaky for a while, taking off work and seeing a therapist for his mental state, but nobody knew how bad he really was doing. The work you are doing, and the charities you encourage support for is doing, is undeniably essensial, especially in these times when economic hardship befalls so many. Wishing you all the best Tom, thanks for doing what you're doing, and thank you to the amazing support crew as well.
congrats tom! great adventure
Genuinely heartwarming stuff and a great video as always Tom, pls keep on being inspiring!
Really enjoyed watching this. Thank you so much for making these videos!
what a amazing achievement !!!!1 thx tom and support crew !!!!
this is insane
What an achievement!!  While watching part 1 I was almost sure you weren't going to make it, but you explained it very well in the end, and I should've known better. It's similar to when planning a mountain day with 1 vertical mile, I'm tired after 1 vertical mile, but if I plan for 2 vertical miles I'm NOT tired after 1 vertical mile, but rather full of energy and feeling like I can "go forever".  Mindset is everything.
Respect, respect, respect!!!!
Incredible Tom! Thanks so much for being an inspiration and a top lad.
This deserves a like more than any other video on the internet
What a lovely video!
Show off.
You're a legend mate
W H Y ????? Humans are utterly insane, and very dangerous.
What a frigging legend
So much respect.
What an incredibly creative and enjoyable mini series this was! Thoroughly enjoyed every moment!
I knew... I just knew you were real wizard xD Great job you nut. Lots of love.
I have to say, I originally came to Tom's channel for the GeoGuessr content, and haven't watched the previous challenges through. I tried, but the video quality/editing wasn't quite up there to hold my broken attention span.. But this challenge, oh wow. The separate camera guy really makes all the difference! And the editing is better paced, too, I think. Can't overlook that. Combined, they really brought the overall vibe from "nah, interesting challenge but I might not watch the entire thing" all the way to "Oh wow, this is actually really interesting to watch, too!".  You've really raised the bar, Tom and the crew! 👌Keep making the challenge videos with this quality, and you'll get a lot more attention to them!
Tom, you impress me so much with every new video series! Such amazing shows of human ability! Good fucking shit.
Russ is a legend
So proud of my youtuber rn
I’d hate to mate it political but the rising knife crime just goes to show that’s imply banning guns doesn’t solve the core issues. I wish we could reduce crime across the board.
I really didn't think you could pull that off, but you're in better shape than I gave you credit for, well done
congratulations Tom. absolutely fantastic
Loved this series. Absolutely outstanding job
Tom, what an inspiration you are! These videos have given me the chills
This ridiculous adventure was a joy to watch. You're a remarkable storyteller Tom. Congrats to you and all the team on this beautiful experience you're sharing with us.
Mate you had me crying for a good 5 minutes. Keep up the great work Tom. You are truly an inspiration!
Russ is an absolute top lad and the perfect man to be by your side on this mission, constantly hyping you up and giving you inspiration to keep going.
What a fantastic achievement! A huge well-done to you and your team for the accomplishment and for the worthy causes that you're raising money for.
♥️
you're an absolute inspiration Tom, great job and great videos to watch.
I'm from Australia and would have loved to have gone but I had a Europe trip that started on the Friday after the trip 😪
Great experience, really loved it, also like the donation purpose
What an epic accomplishment. I don't think anyone could have expected how well this was going to go. Personally, I thought you would complete the journey, but not in one go. This also explains why you showed that "I am struggling right now." clip several times... it was the only available low to build some suspense. I hope you feel satisfied with the journey, regardless of it perhaps going over more easily both mentally and physically than what you had anticipated. This is an incredible feat, and as you said, you could do it not only because of some favourable circumstances, but because of extensive preparation and an amazing support crew.
Absolutely incredible effort to all involved, and what an amazing amount to raise too.
Well done, mate!
Absolutely epic journey. So inspiring Tom
Absolutely top tier shit, well done lad!
Absolutely mental. This is peak GeoWizard. Loved it, and congrats for an amazing achievement.
What’s your favourite football team in Premier League and Italian Serie A?
tom is actually the goat
I know this is not a subject of the video really at all but knife crime is such a weird thing to hear about as an american. Stabbings are never talked about. I mean every now and then there is something on the news but because we have guns everywhere its more about gun violence.   Just to put it in perspective for people not from the US. If someone asked me if I was a firearm owner my first instinct would be to say no. Then after a moment of thinking I'd remember oh yeah I guess I do own guns. I have 2 unregistered firearms sitting maybe 15 feet from me. But since I dont go out to the gun range or anything I don't consider myself a gun person. A keyword in that is unregistered. I live in oklahoma. I don't have to register my guns if I don't want to. In Oklahoma, 54.7% of adults have registered firearms at home. Registered. The actual number including unregistered is probably around 80%. Its a problem for sure but what do we do? I mean I own firearms because everyone else owns firearms. I am all for making guns harder to get.   But to put another thing into perspective this is firearms at home. Most people dont carry them with them. If they do there are 2 ways. Concealed carry which you have to have a license for, and open carry which you dont need a license. Open carry is what police officers generally do, well they normally carry a concealed one as well just in case, but its when its on your hip out for the world to see. I see maybe 1 person a day doing this aside from police and I typically see 75ish people a day at my job. So if you come to oklahoma you probably wont see someone with a gun aside from a cop. Its weird but at the same time its not because its the normal I know. Oh and back to knives. Almost everyone has some sort of knife on them or in their car but its just for utility rather than as a weapon.  Sorry for the long story but maybe someone will find it interesting.
I found this series pretty boring compared to previous ones. No drama like angry farmers, dangerous river crossings, police, etc. Needs less endurance athletics, more adventure. And that ginger beard dude has gotta go. I hope Tom gets back to straight line missions soon, cuz this wasn't very interesting.
What an unbelievable thing to achieve! Congratulations everyone involved!  Remember, if you're ever struggling through the darkness, put some tunes on, stay positive, communicate with those close to you, look after your physical needs, and you never know, the whole slog may feel easier than you ever imagined. Not the first time Three Lions has made me well up. I feel inspired and motivated by your channel, as well as educated and amused. You really are a top bloke!
Dude, my knees hurt just by watching this.
Awesome Job Mate!
Yeah, you get second wind at dawn, when you been up all night, but then I crash again at 2 pm, and I start to nod off in my chair. Not great when you're at work at the office...
That was just absolutely insane. Congratulations!
I don't get how the camera man did it? If they needed all that practice how did he keep up whilst lugging a camera?
Such an amazing job, I know our donations will help
Absolutly fantastic Tom!! What an inspiration you and the whole crew are! Cant wait for the next one
AMAZING ! Fantastic and thank you for allowing us to watch this. Bloody well done !
Pitch black footage is not very nice to watch but I like the overall challenge
this is the first time in a LONG time that a youtube video made me feel so fucking inspired and connected to humanity
Hadrian's wall is the literal definition of Joel Haver CHEST HIGH WALL!!!
The scran in the van for the cameraman stan was very well earned indeed
Beautiful summary for such an inspiring journey! Wishing someday i could do the same thing.
Congratulations to all of you! You did something monumental!
I have to be honest, I thought this challenge would take you a couple attempts. How on earth have you smashed this one first try? I don't think I've ever seen a better support group in anything, those guys were literally by your side the whole way, incredible.   congratulations mate, all for a good cause and spirits were high the whole way through, I've seen worse moods on holiday. Best of luck on your next undoubtably insane adventure!  ps: Big up the friendly bird, surely a good omen
How fitting that you ended up in a Wetherspoons. Congrats mate!!
Next do canada lol
Absolutely wonderful mission, as always Tom. Love this.
AMAZING VIDEO!
you gotta update us on whether or not this video stays monetized after the speaker part
This is your best video ever. And your crew... I am lacking words. What a group, man.
Unbelievable!!! Congratulations 👏
im so proud of u tom. keep up the good work mate
This video deserves to go viral. What Tom and his crew did was absolutely mental and I think that this is by a very long shot one of the best series I've ever followed here on YouTube
Get in Tom! Congratulations
feel like we need a link to the hardest geezer's youtube page in this description.   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKyGSGxBLHvOZt002P9ZK4w
Congrats man! That's bloody unbelievable
Thanks for this Tom. Didn't think you could do it. This made my day, my week, and what a heartwarming way to end it as well. Can't wait for the next mission. Take care :)
I never comment but this was truly amazing Tom!! I can't imagine how hard it must have been to run all of those km!!!! Your ideas are always so unique, i still can't believe how one time you basically hitchhiked from geneva to bratislava with your friend jajajaj. You are a legend for doing this. And the editing and story telling was so touching as well. 1000/10 :')
Damn, did not expect the emotion I felt at the end. Well done everyone!
Need to see how Russ handles a straight liner 😂 he's absolute class, what a legend
Congratulations Tom!  Well done, mate.  A well-planned, well-executed adventure.
Another thing you could have done as preparation would have been to go see the rout beforehand so you know better what paths to take
What an amazing journey! This is the type of stuff we all aspire to do someday
Congrats! Straight line dribbling mission next?
insanity. ill be homewt i never thought it was possible but what an achievement
Congrats man, that was some crazy effort, props to you and your team!
Gunnes world records need to give you a record
Amazing
I'll be honest, I had my doubts but you guys made it look easy. Congrats on accomplishing an amazing feat, Tom!
he does it again
Wish I could have been there to greet you!!! Big ups
Amazing mate, truly inspiring!  Thank you GeoWiz 👊
You're the best Tom, "get in!"
Super cool congrats to everyone involved.
Can't ignore how good the writing in this vid is. Your narration is always so literary and perfect. Well done m8!
I've been struggling with depression and flat feet recently, but in the next few days, I'll do a mini adventure just for you! Thanks for the content, Tom!
Legit the least I could do after watching this epic journey was subscribe! Well done!
9:28  HELL YEAH
Maaate, top effort! Good work on taking it all the way lads
That's genuinely fucking incredible Tom. Such an inspiration.
I will say it again. What an absolute beast of a camera man!!! Wow!
24:20 The Slaves are so good.
GeoWizard? More like GeoChad.
You are a legend man. I cannot believe how easy you made it look, and that camera guy like...wtf. I too have never run more than 10/15km, and I would never attempt to do over 100km like this, it's nuts !
I'd like to see the whole footage.having a hard time believing it.
I cried. This was beautiful. Thanks Tom and everyone!
Congratulations Tom and the entire crew! What an incredible adventure. Even better doing the whole adventure with the same ball. Makes it even more special!
Absolutely incredible! You all smashed it!
He’s only gone and bloody done the thing!!!!
Congrats Tom & Co, Hats off!
The British Bernardo Silva!!!!
Shout-out to Tom for asking fans their names every time. He's not going to remember that, he probably will forget their faces and entirety in time. But he took the time after 120km of running to still ask and make them feel seen and personally addressed. Very cool Tom.
Congratulations, Tom! This was such a joy. The inviting, unique, personal style you’ve developed in these videos deserves to be celebrated. They prove that online video has as much to offer as anything in legacy media.
From Southern California.  You're a legend, Tom.
Your videos are absolutely amazing. Keeping doing the impossible!
8:45 DID U SEE THE IMPACT  had me rolling ahahaha
congratulations! thanks for so much entertainment over the years
"I want a pint of Guinness in a Carling Glass" 😂
love you all
Let's get more Ben skate footage. That gap was bonkers mate
Marylanders represent! ✊
The only way I could describe your adventure videos is artful filmmaking. Bravo, Tom. Great work as always :)
The way he started showboating on the banks of the Tyne made me nervous. A very Geowizard thing to do of course. Luckily he didn't decide to dribble through any peat bogs.
Get in!
the goat fr
What a video. Love the GeoWizard channel and the “mission” videos. The music almost feels nostalgic and as it’s Tom’s it makes the videos unique. Narration is on point and funny and the filming and editing is great.
Congratulations Tom!
Holy shit Ben that ollie was fucked
Well done Tom and team! What a fun adventure. Also - excellent harmony work on Fix You, Tom!
Get in !! Congrats Tom what an achievement
I'm grateful Ludwig introduced me to your channel, incredibly inspiring and a joy to watch your adventures
So much respect for you Tom. You're an inspiration!
Absolutely incredible!
8:44 holy SHIT
Nothing much to say about this whole saga, other than good on you for doing such an original, yet difficult thing, and good on you for doing it for such a good cause. Or a couple of causes I guess. Inspiring stuff.
Absolutely amazing. Didn't expect you to finish it in 24 hours
Boots and Shin pads next time!
the absolute madlads of bounce in 2022
Unbelievable! Congrats man, what a great achievement…and story to bring up in any weathspoons to get a free pint!
9:28 hell yeah
Goddamn what a man you are Tom
jaws would be proud of ben
Absolutely fantastic work mate. Congratulations.
Well done mate!
Witnessing history here. Absolutely amazing. Bravo sir, and what a team you had! Keep up the amazing work bro.
You should auction the Ball (Sonny) to raise more money for charity. Make it like 1£ for a ticket so everybody got a chance to participate and then randomly  pick a winner.
Congrats buddy! Love the videos!
36:58.. youtoube strangers... not once. never ever.. thank god im not youtube famous!
Sending a love and respect from Minnesota, USA. I'm a huge fan your straight line missions and you've outdone yourself with this video, Tom. The narration brought a tear to my eye, you've got some very powerful narrating skills man. Dont stop doing what you're doing, you're a star. WIsh you and the team the best!
Amazing
Damn, what a great crew, what a great everything there ! I have no words ! Congratulations everyone !   Now I want to see you go on an adventure with Ben, Greg, Russ and anyone else who could keep up, would be really fun times !
tommy d
UUggggghhhhh you are such a joy to watch Tom!!! Congratulations!!
Heroic effort mate, smashed it
❤️
Brilliant watch mate, congratulations and thank you so much for sharing this with us. <3
well fucking done bro
38:01 wtf thats the school i went to
slayed tbh
Yes lad
Ъ
nice work man, i love all your adventure videos, hope to meet you in Canada some day
Incredible accomplishment. Count me among the skeptics going in to this challenge. Congratulations to all involved, especially you Tom!
I'm glad you didn't die :)
I once had a dream I won the world cup by grabbing the ball between my knees and hopping across the field to score.  And I don't even like foot ball.
Maryland
That would've been pretty hard
GET IN !!!
Hey Tom. Congrats man. Really.  Thank you from all of us.
Proper job. Comment for algo.
Man im seriously impressed by this! What a feat mate, incredible! Cheers to the whole team!
Legendary stuff Tom
This is insane! Congratulations!
Amazing adventure. Great filming and production.  Perfect length video.
Thanks Tom and amazing crew for another great adventure. I'll never forget you and your adventures. Nothing but positivity, inspiration, and good feelings you have given to the world. Can't wait for the next one
OMG Tom, that was fucking great. And all for a good cause! I still want to see you challenge yourself in the future, to the absolute limit. Like, for example, if you'd come to Finland and tried to cross the country from the legendary Raate to Oulu, I would absolutely take the necessary days off to help you as best as I could. Fucking nice job mate, keep it up! GET IN!
It’s pretty cool that Bernardo Silva has a YouTube channel
Congrats to Tom and the team. I think the support team did loads to help in the journey.
Tom: "That's a welcome sign, because..." Sign: "Welcome to Northumberland" Me: That is literally a welcome sign.
A truly beautiful and inspiring feat, congratulations and well done!
Sometimes a video is posted at the perfect moment with regards to your personal life/schedule.
A mammoth effort, well done! Also cheers for the subtitles, appreciate them.
I’m pretty sure I use the same shoes you’re wearing here for my wandering.
"Camera man Stan in the Van eating some well earned scran" BARS 🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant, love these challenge videos. Great work to all involved, great cause too.
Congratulations Tom! Fucking awesome. Can't wait to see what you tackle next.
When you first announced this  challenge I thought you had gone insane mate. As one of  the doubters I am also joyful to have been proven wrong. You even had time left on the clock, absolute madlad. Thanks to you and the team for being a huge inspiration. Also to the people who have donated, y'all are legends. Cheers mate!

Absolutely astonishing effort from everyone involved. This is inspiration for me to get out a bit more, too. Looking forward to your future adventures. :)
G'day from Newcastle, new south Wales. And well done mate good series.
This was incredible!
Bravo Tom. You' re fucking goated mate
That is definitely not how you say Maryland.
Oh my days you actually made it??!!!! And with 2 hours to spare that is honestly insane. Sp proud of you and your support team! Love your adventures Tom 😃
This latest adventure in addition to being a tremendous achievment seems like it has also been a huge step forward in your production! Thanks to the team you assembled these two videos presented some of the most beautiful imagery yet and did an incredible job of conveying the journey in all its trials. I truly look forward to seeing what you come up with next, after a well earned rest.  James would be proud!
Amazing video!
Good god carrying that camera the whole time is more impressive than kicking a ball, especially considering he's the least experienced with long distance running. Camera guy is the unsung hero
Props to the cameraman who did his first marathon while holding a bunch of camera gear!
Congratulations Tom . What an epic achievement. Well done indeed!
Man you're an absolute gem! To do that whole trip and then take the time to go back to the bridge just to not disappoint any fans is such a nice moment
epic work bloody legends
mega gg
Tom you absolute titan. Was gutted to be working in the toon that day but would've loved to have cheered you on!   I don't usually find people inspirational because usually people try too hard and come across wanky as fuck but you actually do make me want to get out there and live life, top man.
Tom you're a legend and incredible story teller
You're a legend, mate. Cheers from Qingdao via the States
good man
AMAZING!!!! CONGRATS!! WOW!! 👏🏻👏🏻✨✨✨✨✨
Incredible job Tom. Top notch
I love that "where are they now" bit at the end with the crow. I'm glad to see that that crow, who hath brought you good luck on your journey, has its own accomplishment to celebrate.
9:30 Shoutout Maryland lol
Bravo! An amazing accomplishment and an even more amazingly entertaining video!
I was grinning the whole video! That's such wholesome content! And for good cause? Tom you are a LEGEND!
I like how casually the sun starts coming up in ~3AM, in just the North, while the South side is almost pitch black. Northern countries are weird :D:D
Says dribbling but he is kicking and it says football but its a soccer ball...
This channel is what YouTube is all about
holy shit camera man of the year lol
Congrats guys, what an epic journey. You should all be so proud! 🍻 Brilliant content too as usual. And massive respect for the mental health awareness 🙏.
wow oh my fucking god
Amazing. Congrats man!
Next time get a better gimbal to get rid of all that distracting camera shake while running.
Insane work
I’ve been a fan since the just geoguessr days and got hooked at the first straight line mission, this takes the cake as being the most inspirational and incredible thing you’ve done, it’s inspired me to take on a portion of the Appalachian trail this summer. Thank you!
What was the song at the end! So epic man congrats.
Thanks for this video Tom, you are an absolute inspiration and I can't wait for the next adventure!
you never fail to make a great video
*HUGE copyright* 😭
Congrats, Tom! Incredible charities, incredible discipline, and incredible optimism. I'm so glad your channel is growing and more and more people get to feel the joy you bring. Amazing work.
Absolutely wonderful, I can't wait for the America version!
Amazing Tom. So proud of you! Keep up the great work!
Unexpected tears as you crossed the finish line on this. Incredible job, Tom. And what a BOSS fucking support crew - absolute legends. Okay, off to donate now. ❤️❤️❤️
Fantastic job team!
Incredible achievement!
Congratulations, an amazing effort for a great cause!
Thank you for the update on the bird 🫡
Great deed mate... rooting for your success throughout whole journey haha felt good after u completed it
I don't even know how many times I checked whether i had already liked this video. Had done it at 0:29 or so ^^
<3
Guy runs for 12 hours on empty stomach...  Medic: "You should eat"...  Guy praises medic for this novel advice
Right on, Tom (and crew)! So well done, found myself getting all emotional there at the end. A joy to watch this, and to donate to one of your causes. Congratulations bud, from Montreal, Canada, and looking forward to the next adventure!
Absolutely fucking mental Tom! Congrats to you and your team
Knife crime down 56% in Sussex?🤔
Amazing work Tom & team.  Richard Keys would say you smashed that.
GeoWizard the only person I know that can say “that’s a welcome sign” to an actual welcome sign and get away with it
Nicely done, and, the charities promotion is amazing. ☺️
Unreal Tom.  You kept featuring my comment on the first video where I said how hard it would be, and you kept making me feel like an idiot by smashing all my expectations! You deserve all the success you’re getting with these donations mate.
Good God mate, what an inspiration you are. Watched you run along the Tyne listening to Vindaloo with a massive beam on my face
Legend
Id struggle staying awake for that long let alone spending the whole time dribbling a football up and down hikers tracks
Well done mate, what's next? :P <3
absolutely monumentous.
Commenting for the algorithm
Congrats Tom
Sorry to say but you used your hands so that voids the entire run!
the song at 26:08 lol
what an absolute hero
Great job mate !
You've really outdone yourself with this one Tom. This is the best video you have made to date. Cheers!
Good on you mate!  This is literally the most bonkers achievement I've ever seen
phenomenal, that is all
Absolute gem of a guy
Tom you have a gift. Not for GeoGuessr or naming all the countries in the world. Not for going on absolutely mental missions that highlight your adventurous side. You have a gift for story telling. You have a gift for uplifting people’s spirits and putting smiles on their faces. Thank you for all that you do, you certainly do both for me. ❤️
Tears coming to my eyes 🥺
I love the adventures so much
fucking amazing - well done team
Big up that fucking camera man mate. He deserves something special Tom. Maybe a surprise video!?:)
Well done Tom.  that team you put together was solid, deffo think the room for more of them with you in future challenges.  All the best :)
Plz try a diffrent thumbnail, almost missed it.
Fuck off tom, I’m balling my eyes out. Amazing job to you and your team, keep it up!
I have just balled my eyes out. So immensely proud and humbled by your feat. I have watched your series since discovering you during lockdown and I was in a very dark place. You are a beautiful soul and I am honoured to have joined you in your journeys. You have inspired me to push my own limits. Wish I could donate more. Thanks for bringing so much light into the world 🌍
When I first got told about this challenge my reaction was "corrr dunno about that" but from start to finish you showed everyone what's up, heroic stuff Tom! On behalf of everyone at the running charity I'd like to say a massive thank you to the viewers for your donations and support, it'll go an awfully long way!
Congratulations Tom and the whole team! A truly inspirational story and achievement! Tears are filling my eye as I type this, that’s how proud I am just to have witnessed such an amazing achievement. Congratulation again, and we’re all looking forward to the next journey for you Tom!
This is without a doubt, the best two part series on YouTube. The story and the journey is beautiful
Congrats!!!!
woop
Bloody amazing
Russ really did curate some vibes.  This is an instant classic and enters the canon of Tom's greatest hits.
What an amazing video. Congratulations Tom and great work
You are the best kind of crazy
I try to keep my comments safe for all ages, but I have to give you (and your team) a "FUCK YEAH, MATE" for this one. Good on ya.
Tom, God damn it. You are such an inspiration. I swear i will have to try something like this, an adventure of a lifetime, not exactly this but something extraordinary to remember my whole life. I am a guy who likes adventures and is always "ready" to go and do something and damn it, if you didn't just inspired me to do something for myself. Good bless you and your sweet soul for collecting money for charities. You are really extraordinary guy with huge heart. I can't wait to see more from you and your adventures. I will remember and cherish this 2 videos forever. Thank you Tom.  Get in! And cheers mate! ♥️  Greetings from Serbia ♥️
fucking beautiful mate
You’re an inspiration to live my life. Congrats! And thank you for sharing
Congratulations mate, incredible
You just knew you would trigger everyone from Maryland with that pronunciation, didn't you?
Robin Hood Prince of Thieves filmed at Sycamore Gap very close by.  It's the best scene with Michael Wincott.
I live in Newburn in Newcastle and I’m sorry too say but it’s no where near the sea/coast
outstanding mate you just love to see it
Tom, you're an inspiration, watching you makes me want to do so much with my life, make it more exciting, more vibrant. You remind me how important it is to keep on having adventures, small or big ones, especially ones that are outdoors and with good company!
I wish I had something more intelligent to say but I fuckin loved watching that. Welcome to Newcastle :)
Incredible stuff Tom, you and the crew did yourselves proud.
Have u a link to your Strava? A true inspiration.
Amazing Tom! Really hope the music doesn’t get you demonetized in this one!
GOAT
Absolutely fantastic work Tom. Wholesome as usual.
Not sure if you’ve already seen it, but check out Lachlan Morton and his alt tour ride. He does some really cool stuff and I find it similar to your endurance challenges!
What a great adventure and for such a great cause. Can’t wait to see the next one!
you won't be lacking behind Welsh Greg anymore
Congratulations! A monumental achievement for you and your crew. An absolute legend. James would be proud.
I almost never comment on YouTube videos but honestly what an amazing effort. Fair play !!!
fucking incredible
Basketball without holding it next? (=
Tom I’ve said it before but I will say it again, you are a legend and I seek to emulate you in my own real life adventures. Can’t wait to see what else you have in store.
Get in!!!
Absolutely phenomenal mate. What a way to prove everyone wrong. The right challenge at the right time for the right cause. You and the crew smashed it 🙌
"And I will try to kick you..."😭
Well done Tom!! Amazing achievement.
What a crazy adventure. Congrats to you and your crew.
You and your “tidal” areas! It might experience some tides but it’s sure as hell not the coast
Great job Tom and team! What a great job and great thing to do for those charities.
Legendary scenes
This has been incredible. Well done.
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!
Thank you Tom for spreading awareness! I moved away from home right before Covid hit. Having literally no friends, smoking weed all day and not seeing sunlight very often fucked me up quite a lot. I'm currently trying to change my life for the better by quitting weed. I as well reached out to some therapists the other day. Hope I will feel better soon.
Fair play Tom, against every single person saying this wasn’t possible you did it. That’s what your about keep it up my man what an inspiration
I been feeling down lately as I just started college and shit kind of hit the fan, had to drop a class and I will probably fall behind now. In general I just feel lost about what I will do in life. Just want to say thank you for the videos, always something I can look forward too. You are truly one of a kind, keep up the adventures.
Russ is such a legend, hope he pulls off his African adventure
Unreal! Proud of you man. What a video concept this was!!
What an absolutely perfectly narrated, edited and produced masterpiece of a video. You are really nailing these epic adventures everytime and somehow always make sure to make the journey feel so epic as a viewer. Congratulations on doing something so insane, for the better good. You're truly an inspiration and I love that you're so passionate about the charities involved in this project.  Thanks for the content as always! We truly appreciate it, as the like counter and the comments show.
Hey Tom, congrats , bless out and your team!
Love stuff like this, keep it up mate 🤠
this one was touching thanks Tom, don't stop adventure ever
What a great adventure and a seriously monumentball achievement! Tom, keep going and keep sharing your journey, we will be here to watch and share. Cheers
26:00 Oh man I just had a thought that would make the stairs so much better. Do the same ball between the feet technique but go backwards up the stairs while sitting, alternate between sitting up one step and lifting the ball up one step instead of jumping.
What an effort Tom! Inspiring journey and props to the support crew as well as they probably made the difference in the end. Can’t wait to see what you do next!
Well done mate.
more vids with geez
As someone who’s just started running ( struggling ) in an attempt to get into shape in my early 20s, this is impossibly impressive. I can barely run for longer than 3 minutes at a time, getting about 4km with walking intervals - this just seems like the most incredible feat in the world.
Comment for the algorithm.
Huge congratulations Tom! Fucking awesome!
Absolutely cracking effort lad well done to you and the entire support team. 👏
666 comments! Enjoyed this, thanks fella me lad! I love your adventures, more please.
What an awesome watch. Massive congrats Tom, Sonny (of course!) and team, what a brilliant achievement. What craziness will come next to top this?!?
Congrats Tom!
you’re him. true baller.
Well done Tom, really enjoyed this on. Any more straight line attempts?
Wow Tom. Just Wow. The things you do for this channel are unmatched on all of YouTube. From your incredible ideas and execution to engaging commentary. Well done on another incredible accomplishment.
Wonder what bird type it was? Looked like a crow but surely not with him being that tame?
:)
The "Fix You" (Kick You) part gave me chills haha.
Bloody well done mate!
Smashed it Tom, well done. Also congrats to the whole team, was a really good short series. Looking forward to you and Gregg in America!
Wow this Russ guy is the very definition of a mad lad
Absolutely fantastic set of videos. Stellar content as always. Phenomenal execution, brilliant narration and a worthy cause. I've been here since before the first Wales mission and it is videos like this when I remember just how much fun I've had watching your content over the years, mate. Thank you very much, Tom! And congrats!
Idk how you actually succeded. You did virtually no preparation in trainihg, and you clowned around so damn much. Amazing. By all intents and purposes, you should have failed. Well done though.
looking forward to your rugby ball version of this
As somebody who is both overweight and suffering with poor mental health as a result, this is an absolute inspiration. Nothing I've seen in the last few years has made me want to get off my arse and go out for a jog more than seeing you utterly crush this with a smile on your face the whole way - might just try a kilometre or two first before I cross the country!
Absolute legend! So glad you made it brother! Top notch!
Wow! That's a seriously impressive feat of endurance from all of you! Including the inexperienced cameraman who carried a 6kg camera the entire time, beasted it!
Absolutely fantastic. Had me in tears watching this, awe inspiring.  Well done Tom and the team.

Do the USA next? A quick 2,089 miles for the boys?
SPOILERS people, SPOILERS.

Incredible 🙌
leaving a comment for the algorithm! congrats my man
Thoroughly enjoyed watching this video and the previous one
This is excellent, Tom. The end of this video was so moving that it brought me to tears. I think it was a combination of seeing you succeed at your mission and seeing the support that you have around you, including those who made a trip to meet you at the end of your long journey. Congratulations on a goal achieved!
An incredible effort!! Great team too. Well done. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You're a hero Tom. What a mission, what a crew and what content.
Truly inspiring. Wow!
Love it - well done team!
⚽⚽⚽ Awesome job for great causes. Well done Tom and Team ⚽⚽⚽
Get in!  Well done for condensing it into two videos. And raising funds for worthy causes.   Can't wait to see what you come up with next.
also 16 year old ben shattering his ankles and knees will stay in my mind for a few weeks, traumatising
Incredible and remarkable Tom and team!
You're actually gonna make me cry with that ending Tom. Just top notch content as always. I'm touched to just be a small part of this online community, and one day I hope I get the chance to meet you and shake your hand and maybe have some of those eternally positive vibes and that sense of adventure soak into me.
5:13 "That's a welcome sign..." Not sure if that was intentional or not, but well done either way lol.
kinda boring. Should've done a straight line.
i really, really appreciate the subtitles
I thought this would be impossible to do under 24 hours. My gosh I am impressed.   Shout out to the cameramen, this was very well recorded I must say!
Wait wait wait, your friend that got murdered...he didn't drink, but...got murdered on the way home from the pub??????? Huh????
You’re a hero for this Tom, just such insane dedication to an important cause that effects us all. I’m wearing 100 hats and all hats off to you my friend. Watched the Europe series recently and it was one of the best series i’ve ever seen not just on youtube but ever. Complete legend, never change, keep loosely breaking laws and making insane adventures.
Congratulations Tom, you bought so many smiles to my face during lockdown watching through all your videos and to see you achieve such an incredible feat for so many great causes is amazing!!
Would love to know your man’s motivational playlist
Cheers, mate! Congrats!
watching this while eating a fatty chicken burger, amazing
I love how many people Tom runs into who recognize him, know what he's doing and are casually like "Good work Tom"
How do you get these ideas
Well done Tom and friends. Well done indeed.
you fucking legend
Absolute bunch of legends, please release the music playlist on Spotify.
As someone who can't kick a football for shit, I am absolutely in awe of the fact that you never lost the football.
Nowt like slaves to keep the vibes going
Well done Tom and everyone... I honestly cried when you got to the end and again with your outro.  Really inspiring, I hope you're proud of yourself, because we're all proud of you.  Brilliant... Just brilliant... When is the movie coming out?
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND <3 <3
i feel proud of you man shits crazy im inspired now gonna go on a run
The second part so soon? WOOP!
It’s so hard to dislike this video, it doesn’t even show up!
Unbelievable!
Did not expect to be seeing you guys blasting out Slaves during this, great choice in music! Absolute pleasure to watch. Can’t wait to see the next crazy thing you do!
don't mind me just sobbing in my room lol
Well done Sir and support team. What a mad, brilliant idea and adventure.  Loves it. ❤️
Unbelieve achievement. Congrats to everyone involved!
Normally I’m not one to comment, but I’ve got to comment on this amazing episode.  First of all, what a great concept and incredible achievement! Truly insane. Also, what a great support group you had throughout this challenge.  But second, and most importantly, it is really inspiring to see you promoting these charities. The running charity is amazing, and your mate who set it up is inspiring. Considering the knife crime charity, what a sad story of your friend. I’m not from the UK to witness the increase in knife crime, but I do see a similar trend here in the Netherlands and it is really concerning. Lastly, I am honestly touched by your effort in helping people who are struggling mentally. Having been in a not so good place myself, it really hits me to hear your story and to see the good you are doing. I will for sure donate to the cause.  As said, normally not one to respond, but really wanted to show my appreciation
Oh awesome, we played Sir Duke in jazz band last year  good song. kinda hard.
Weird one but can anyone identify that guys shoes at 35:35?? The brown ones the guy on the bike has
I wish i could like this twice. i was full on grinning for the last few minutes of the video. so impressed that you succeeded, and with such flair!
Well done......all of you.
Top notch content.
Disciplined preparation, plus a great team. Great job to the whole team, and of course Tom for coming up with nearly impossibly challenges, and taking them on! Cheers!!
Thank you.
Posting this before the end of the video but you could auction Sonny to raise some extra bunce for the charity.
Just absolutly amazing mate!  Not only the run wich must have been hard as hell but the charities you support with this. I've been fighting depression for years now and to anybody that reads this, who feels like they might go down a dark mental path: Talk to people, don't isolate yourself even if it's extremely hard at times.  There are people who love you and support you, always remember that!
loved being part of this mission, cheers for all the experiences guys. KingCobraJFS deep fried Avacados are on the menu from here out
what an insperation
Beast
I almost felt like I was running this with you all. Even to the point of feeling a bit shattered myself! I can't imagine how fit you all must be. Some effort!
congratulations mate. all of the crew too. done a briliant job. glad to have seen it through. thanks for posting this
Beautiful video
I'm suffering with depression. It's YouTubers like you that keep me going. Thank you and congratulations on your latest achievement.
Tom I’m not normally one to comment but this was something really special. You are an absolutely incredible person and this video really shows all of it. Huge pat on the back from everyone 👏🏻
Why do I feel so warm inside?
UNBELIEVABLE. This was so enthralling and I felt like I was there. One of the most impressive and interesting things I have seen
I think i would need over a month of recovery if i did that.
Your videos inspired me to walk the entire Suffolk coast 111km last year for charity and now I feel you've done it again and I need to plan my another challenge for myself.
great stuff dude
This absolutely epic. Some serious mahi (hardwork).
What an inspiration, the best YouTuber in the world and to do it all in the name of charity shows you have a heart of gold. You proved me dead wrong as well. Congratulations ⚽️
Incredible achievement Tom and support team! I think I was in the camp when you announced it of thinking this was absolutely bonkers and yet you just smashed it out the park!
what an incredible couple of videos, feeling very proud of you and your team! (whether you made it or not)
LET'S GO TOM
Well done, on a fantastic adventure, successful fund- and awareness-raiser and amazing story-telling!
Was nice of you to go say gday to the people waiting after you'd made it. Well done, cherish that ball
There is nothing like this on YouTube. Congrats mate!
That's the most wholesome geowizard video ever done.
Credits to your gf for staying so calm! And the whole crew!
Loved these two videos and all of your others on the channel. An amazing achievement Tom, great causes and brilliant entertainment. Look forward to future challenges.
It must feel so great especially with all those people in the comments who were like “I have way more experience with this stuff than you and it is impossible for you to complete it in under 24 hours.” Good job proving them wrong!
Vindaloo along the banks of the Tyne running together as a group - utterly epic moment! Well done Tom, and to the whole crew - amazing achievement!
Just a comment for the algorithm cause this video deserves it
Absolutely amazing. Love this challenge and everything it stands for. What a great team of people too. Well done
Tom, words can't describe how happy this video made me. As someone who suffers from mental health issues such as the one your raising money for, to watch you throughout the mission just made me cry. Its so inspiring to see how you overcame all that pain throughout as it speaks volumes about how much you care about the topic and trust me, to all the men struggling out there; this means the absolute world. You ROCK.
WELL DONE TOM!!! Cracking effort mate!      P.S 24:35 Russ is my fucking spirit animal Hahahahahahha
Fantastic job! The support crew were amazing, and Russ is an absolute geezer!
Imagine that walker wellied it into the river 😂
Amazing effort as ever. Keep looking after yourself for your sake and ours, because we all wanna watch you for years and years to come.
I am one of the people who commented on your old videos saying you don't stand a fucking chance haha. Good on you mate - I'm eating my words!
Now I feel bad only running 3k hehe
this was amazing. congratulations mate well done
These videos are incredible films. You have achieved something brilliant and you can showcase it in such an amazing way.
Tom, that was amazing, so inspirational, I’ve donated! It’s the least we can do to help the amazing causes you ran for! Love it bro! Can’t wait for more adventures
Thank you Tom.
Nailed the unison line at 6:58, well done mate.
What a legend. I doubted you could do it in the time frame but was clearly wrong, you smashed it.
Congratulations!!
This was an absolute blast to watch. Congratulations Tom! Many of us doubted if this was safely possible. Seems that support crew of yours made for an unbreakable safety net. Good job guys!   Now an off topic request from someone who loves both your Mission AND Geoguessr content...  Rainbolt has been hosting pro GG tourneys every weekend now and we've been seeing a rise in GeoWizard references/jokes during the streams... perhaps you could talk to him about maybe teaming up. Call it a Pro-Am tourney or something. But I'd love to see/hear you on a call with Rainbolt and some of the other GeoGuessr legends. No matter how out-of-practice you are at the game. It would be lots of fun!
Fucking immense man! Congrats to you and all involved. Straight line takes balls, but this shit takes every strength and quality someone can possess and I'm in awe!
That is a soccer ball sir.. ⚽️… a football looks like this 🏈
Congrats!!! This was amazing!!!
well done. Brilliant. maybe someday if you ever attempt a straight line mission again it'll be across new Zealand or Australia? just an idea.
This is some of the best content YouTube has to offer
Incredible Tom, your an absolute legend. What you stand for means alot to alot of people, your an inspiration to so many people. I'm just gutted I couldn't be there to meet you in the other end but I didn't think for a second that wouldn't have made it.  Thank you so much for everything you do bro.
Glad the medic made him actually eat!
Gz
was a pleasure to be on the journey with you (yes i’m the ball)🤣
Hi, that is the kind of determination i need to see! Merci Tom!
Got me tearing up man. Such a beautiful ending and incredible goal and achievement! Cheers from Morocco
I was expecting you to finish with a bottle of newcastle broon at the pub! Top job though, looking forward to your next challenge
Such a fun video, a great team and an amazing cause. Keep it going Tom and congratulations! :D (Btw straight line mission Sweden or Iceland?)
Incredibly inspiring mate, I really appreciate both your content and the causes you promote. Thank you.
Amazing effort by all of you, such a wonderful way to raise awareness and donations for charity!
All those people who said you couldn't do it. You proved them wrong with time to spare.  Well done mate, you and the team as well.
That was amazing. Russ was brilliant for morale and keeping everyone in check. Solid teamwork and props to the cameraman for battling through. Well done Tom, felt proud watching this one
Brilliant,  well done, and to the whole crew,   really inspirational,  your all great
Tom mate, congrats on a fucking insane ultra.  Never seen anything like it.  You’re a legend, russ is a legend.  Likewise are verity and everybody who made this happen.  Congrats on completing it, some really inspiring stuff and the comradery looks amazing. Definitely want to get out and start a bit of trail running off the back off this.  Keep it up! Thanks for entertaining us with your wild adventures.  If you need any help in Scotland please shout. X
The biggest achievement of this challenge is the Sondico ball lasting so long.
Get IN! I knew you could do it! Congrats Tom!
Well done mate! good on ya!
Good shit Tom and team!
Mate well impressive 👏 so proud of u and thanks for taking us all along with u
Can't believe you made it!!! Congratulations to you and the whole team - what an achievement!
I will never doubt this man Tom ever again. If he says he's gonna play ice hockey all the way to the moon. I'll believe him and meet him there!
Great series! Was hoping for a dive in the Tyne 🤣 felt like something was missing but that could have been the lack of Chiptune. Seriously though great causes and you should be massively proud of everything you have achieved
"I want a pint of gunniss in a carling glass" 🤣🤣🤣 joker.
Knives aren't the problem, the people using them to kill are. Might be interesting to look into the demographics of who those people are
This man deserves more subs than Mr. Beast
Kind of boring
SPOILERS  Mate. I was worried when the video title said "attempted". What an absolute legend just ploughing through the whole route and even coming in early.   But let's not forget the unsung hero of the story, Sonny. Being kicked, going off course, rolling down hills with no certain direction. But it all paid off when at 31:28 Sonny got to experience the moment that every ball is dreaming of. GOOOOAAAAL!
In part 1, it took about half the video before I declared that this was a mad idea. In part 2, it took about a minute and a half before I got to that conclusion.
Sisyphus and his stone
Congrats man! I'm always impressed with your adventure missions. Can't wait to see more!!
whats that huge glass building across the river in Newcastle? Also what do people in Newcastle think about Newcastle beer?
You should all be so proud. Hell of a shift you lot put in there
Phenomenal effort by all involved, many congratulations!
Amazing Stuff, just inspirational
We need to have the vibes playlist dropped for us to listen to,  amazing journey from the whole crew and glad Newcastle treated you nicely.
Following on from this, would love to see you have a go at some football related GeoGuessrs or maybe map based football quizzes on sporcle
Your content is so… different. And that makes it so good!
Deep respect for Tom and his crew!
Tom, imho you’re not meant to process every piece. Your meant to experience the journey and grow from the lessons learned along the way. Keep up the good work!
Well done.
Eating sugar when you feel like that is not really a good idea. What you need is slow carbs or fat.
Good going!
Ooooh Bernardo Silva!!!
As a Marylander, I’m glad we got a shoutout!
What a journey!! Congratulations 🎊
Love everything about it.
Truly phenomenal
You ran past my car in Heddon 🤣🤣
Great work lads. Really terrific. Finding real adventure in the heart of quiet old England like this is a genuine inspiration. Love the banter the whole way too!!
Well done mate.
All I want to say is Tom you're an absolute LEGEND
I will say it again. The best content on YouTube.
Tom, you are simply awesome.
Good on ya mate
Thank you so much Tom. You have really inspired me
Not sure if you know of Beau Miles, but I see some influence in this endeavor.  Nothing wrong with that.  This is what Thoreau meant by, "Live deep, and suck the marrow from life".  Well done!
YOU'RE THE BEST TOM great initiative
Well done Tom, I've never been more inspired.  Since some minor health issues about a year ago I haven't felt the determination to run much since. Watching this has made me catch the running bug again, thank you for the inspiration.
You're a azing honestly these two videos have been quality and all the charity to go along with it is mega
Congrats dude! I predicted it would be super close so impressed you did it with time to spare. Do you have a Discord? Or Instagram? Something else I can follow you on?
This has got to be your best work, Tom. I'm not the kind of person to use sappy words like "inspirational" but I can't think of any other way to describe how this one left me feeling. I feel like I need to get out, do something insane, and do it for a good cause. Cheers, Tom.
SPOILERS  I'm the kind of person who reads comments during videos, especially long ones like this. But I was so invested in the outcome that I forced myself to stay away and I'm so glad I did. This was incredible. Congratulations Tom and everyone involved 👏
I teared up when you mentioned James. I mean, I don't know how much he lives through your adventures. But you and him are still together, in a way. You and your passions are incredible.

Watched the whole thing smiling, well done
thanks for the update on the bird, I had many a sleepless night worried about the outcome of that little fella! and congrats on the challenge too I guess ;)
Congratulations Tom! I´ve done the Dodentocht in Belgium (100km in max. 24h) and I know of the struggles you went through, the exhaustion, the emptiness, but also the joy of reaching your goal..  But doing a even further distance with A BALL ON YOUR FEET THE ENTIRE TIME, insane! Just an insane achievement. Well met!
You didn't just make it, but you smashed it mate, well done. Brilliant!
This your best work, Tom. With the support of others ofcourse!
can you imagine being the random person to kick the ball back to them in Newcastle, thinking youre helping
The best creator on this platform by a country back lane mile. Well done Tom, mega. Hat's off to a phenomenal team as well. When we come together we can achieve impossible things ❤⚽
Bang up job, Tom. And both causes are super admirable.
Your very underrated my guy such dedication
what an absolute legend
Crazy, didn't thought you would make it, but you did it even with spare time. Congratulations
that was awesome huge congratulations

Well done!!
Hell yeah, brother
totally unsurprising to find 'the hardest geeza' has a shite taste in music
Ahh the George at Chollerford.  The only job I ever got sacked from....... I did throw egg at a twat of a customer so did deserve it.
Wow that was dull
common geowizard W
Great work Tom and congratulations 👏 👏 👏
Brilliant work Geo, your messages in this vid hit hard.  Great to see mates coming together to support each other, lifting the mood, I'm sure your top notch support was a massive factor in you getting through this without the deep lows.  I'm currently developing a public access BleedBox - these cabinets contain 'stop the bleed' kits and are installed in areas where there is a high risk of knife crime.  When we get this into production, I would like to donate ten cabinets filled with bleed kits, each one with a dedication to your mate.
Great job and you had a great team. Can't believe you had nothing sugary to eat with you between van stops. That's crazy.
Awesome, I thought you would have continued and went to the coast/beach, Whitley bay so it’s coast to coast. You’ve came so very far from pinning a point on a map 🥳🥳🥳
The fact that you had a crew made this a lot better. The frequent crew made stops is what did the trick IMO. I think you could apply the same thing for a straight line mission, although that would be much harder, you'd have to get some guys to do this for days. For very long distance straight line missions I do think this is the way though.
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
congratulations Tom. this has been one of the best things i have watched in a long time. i've been a fan for a few years now and seeing all your accomplishments has been amazing but this was the best so far and for such great causes too. you had me in tears by the end, was very emotional. well done to you and all the team!!!
Being a GeoWizard subscriber is a treat. Thank you and congratulations to everyone involved.
Is it too cheeky to class crossing Cornwall as a British coast to coast?
This was mental!
absolutely brilliant
Congrat's ya little Wizard!
Love everything about the video but seriously your narration is just top notch !! Keep up the great work & fun
That was epic on so many levels! Congratulations and thank you for going above and beyond ❤️

Well done everyone!  What else can I say?  💪
Get in Tom! Congrats!
Absolutely smashed it Tom, what an achievement! These challenges are so inspirational and can’t wait to see what you take on next after some well-earned time off!
Ur absolutly insane! Congrats!
RIP Jim
Congrats Tom! Truly an incredible achievement!!
Nice one!
good on ya mate
Awesome
that bird part was a nice little throwback
man, lovely. you guys are mental. congratulations! greetings from Deutschland
You are such an inspiration! Thank you =)
May be a silly observation, but out of those 40 mins video, the moment that caught my attention the most is at 37:15. The fact that the lad's name is Sam and he looks rather similar to Sam from Game of Thrones is mindblowing. But perhaps it is just me. Anyways, great job Tom, looking forward to whatever else you can possibly come up with.
One of your best Tom. Congratulations.
Very cool. Loved the team. Be great to see them help you on a straight line mission, cameraman could capture better angles potentially
Well done mate!! You are an inspiration.  Looking forward to seeing you on your trip to America.
Legendary vid as always Tom, what a great team. Congrats guys!
Haha I thought that steep hill at 3:00 would cause some issues, very fun to walk up!
Awesome, I loved this, I hope they don't try to copyright nuke you for vibing to Stevie Wonder lol
GET IN!!!  Congrats Tom! As one of the people who thought this would be impossible, I have NEVER been more happy to be proven wrong. To call this inspiring would be an understatement. Been watching since 10k subs and to see how far you've come has been a joy. I hope you're beyond proud of what you've accomplished and the good it will do, because everyone else certainly is. Also—your team seems like the best anyone could ask for. Big thanks to them for both the laughs and the beautiful, powerful moments that were created. Enjoy this feeling, you've earned it mate!
What a legend, love what you are doing with your platform.
5:12 *”That’s a welcome sign…”*   *quite literally Tom*
Congratulations Tom, kick on.
So awesome. Congratulations to all of you. Looks like an amazing group of people who I'd love to drink a pint with.  Already can't wait for the next series!
Mad and crazy!
Well done all of you!
the knife thing is so weird to me as a Canadian, everyone outside of a major city has multiple guns and knives, we do have some gang violence in the major cities but for the most part things are pretty good. how did everyone else get it so wrong? it must just be your environment, where i live everyone is armed to the teeth, because bears. ive had so many encounters with bears i cant even count
you're a godamn hero. props to you sir
Well done Tom and crew! It looked tough at times, to say the least. Massive respect to y'all.
Well done mate 👍
Cannot describe how happy your videos make me. Please don’t stop. Much love from The Netherlands
This is so heartwarming 🥰
Cameraman is such a legend, MVP! Well done Tom, mate.  Unreal
Mate!
What a good lad.
Chapeau Tom, you are a fucking legend. This was such a joy to watch. Incredible
Tom. Mate. Dude. You never seize to amaze me. You're fucking amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't know what else to say. You're a legend man. Fucking legend.
what a journey this was  congrats mate
Truly inspiring <3
I'm running my first marathon soon and have never been good at seeing any project through. Seeing this has been really motivating and, as well as loving the videos, has been really motivating to keep going and to continue through until October when it is. Love the channel and your continued feats! (also well aware that saying this on a video containing both you and the Hardest Geezer is nothing related to your achievements but everyone has to start somewhere!)
Congratulations. Very well done, all of you.
Congrats Tom 👏

Grew up in heddon on the wall and can confirm that station bank is an absolute killer. Used to train by riding my bike up. The amount of times I've puked in those bushes 😂
Thanks Tom :)
what a way to save a stressful day
Well done dude! And success on the first try, without controversy. Shoulda had Guinness with you to verify this. 👍🏼
Congratulations Tom and the team! 🥳 You guys did amazing. What a fun, and incredible feat and challenge. The stories you make are such great moments to view on YouTube. Thanks for sharing them with us!
Legend 💛❤️💙
Hats off to everyone involved in this. What a truly remarkable adventure. Can't wait to see what lies ahead.
That was lovely, well done Tom
You all made that look easy, but basically ran an ultramarathon while dribbling. Awesome achievement, inspirational and all for some great causes.
"I want a pint of Guinness in a Carling glass" 🤣
Ah man, this is so great. Cheers to everyone involved.
Congratulations mate. That was pretty fucking impressive. Shout out to everyone who was involved.
You and the team did an amazing job. So inspiring as well. Thanks for sharing.
This was so epic! Such a great journey! Can't wait for the America series with Greg now
Great video Tom, and what an amazing achievement. Congratulations! All the best, David
thank you tom, absolute legend
respect tom, that was an amazing journey and an amazing story
genuinely thought there was something missing in part 1, compared to straight line missions and so forth. i have to put those words somewhere in order to eat them. this was a fantastic video
Legendary!
8:46 man that is raddddd
Big congratulations to you and the whole team, great effort and great to watch! ❤🤍💙
Yes Tom! Mm it's satisfying after seeing all the doubeters hehe.
I just love how you prove all those doubters wrong, yo can do it!!!!
I loved both of these vids
you are a beast I can't express enough how I respect you for all that you have done
Wow, big achievement! I'm suffering from depressions and that's why I have to thank you for your effort!
FUCKING GOAT
Dick the birthday Ben!
Recommended this video, realized why the lack of views to only see it was uploaded 2 hours ago lol
this had to be the best mission yet, special shouts out to sonny, the real mvp
Congratulations! What a great joy to watch! You are doing great job with your videos - inspiration for many!
Great work to all of your team!  Amazing stuff and I hope you do things with them again sometime.  Onto to the next.
What a awesome adventure had and inspiration projected. Preparing/Expecting for the worse is great advise in most shity situations in life. Your content is how we should all think.........."Outside the Box"............Nice One Tom.
Please never stop your adventures Tom! You’re an inspiration to us all!
Well done mate,  wish I could of came to see you.

Genuinely incredible achievement, Tom. I’ve been here since less than 100k and seeing all the things you’ve achieved over the last few years has been a complete joy. You’re an inspiration! Can’t wait for the next one.
Absolutely awesome mate 👍👍

Love it.   I have done stupid things like this and nothing makes better memories.   Fill your head full of memories.   Some things are fun to do and other things are fun to have done.
Nice one. Just goes to show don't pay attention to people too afraid to do it themselves, it was always doable in 24h for fit guys with good planning and support.
Such an awesome Video. Lovin' it
Man quite honestly I'm at a loss of words right now but thought I'd leave a comment anyway. You're such an inspiration man, congrats on completing a hell of a mission!
Its not a knife problem the UK has it it a migrant invasion problem.....Nobody will admit it though.... its pathetic.
It triggers me slightly that you keep referring to them as "van stops" and on the map they are labelled as "van spots"  only complaint
Cracking job guys
Good on you Tom. What a legend and what a cause.
An amazing unreal effort that well done and such a good watch this was . . . . But the ball was never dipped again at the end point 💁🏻‍♂️⚽️
Well Done, superb video, amazing challenge !
very very inspiring ! I'm physically very far from being capable of doing something like this but this motivates me so much to train, even if it's for something a lot easier like a half marathon
I love you Tom. You are seriously such a good dude and your message of hope is inspiring. This is definitely the coolest thing you've done IMO and it makes me excited to see what kind of crazy shenanigans you think of next!
Good job, your videos always motivate me to go on some adventures of my own, thx
amazing bro!

Well done Tom! Amazing video and cause. What a great crew you had too!
Truly an inspiration.
Absolute unit.
Congratulations m8! I can't believe yo managed to do it on the first try, I'm glad that all winds were on your favour
Absolute mad lad!  So proud of you Tom.  This is no joke, even if it seemed relatively easy.
when are you coming to the USA?
Tom and team, this is a great win! Nice job on the achievement and bringing attention to several good causes 🦵 One thing though I really don't agree with (being Irish) No Guinness in Carling glasses. FFS 😸
Russ is a legend
Absolutely phenomenal stuff Tom, you're an inspiration
Congratulations, I love following your adventures!
Great job!  Congratulations!
What an achievement! Inspiring stuff 👏 👏 👏
Fockin legend m8
That was amazing Tom and a pleasure to watch. I even shed a tear at the end! I’ve been through a lot of crap the last couple of years and this is the sort of inspiration we all need to help us through hard times.
Russ is my type of guy.
Those adventures of yours are just so wholesome and inspirational. You are one of the good ones, Tom.
what an pleasure watching these 2 videos
truly amazing!!! Well Done!
I can't believe you've done this
You absolute mad lad, congratualtions on completing this absurd foot. hope the recovery went okay.
Well done mate, you're an absolute legend
This is absolutely brilliant. Well done Tom and all the crew. What a great team.   I don’t know you but as a fellow Yam Yam arm ever so cowin proud ay I?
Epic mate well done 👍🏼
what I love about the James Brindley Foundation is that they aren't trying to get more laws or higher sentencing pushed through. They're trying to help the people before they even get to the point of committing the act. Truly the ONLY WAY to help solve violence
oh, yes. I like it, get in! nice one, congrats
Brilliant
So glad to see this movie! Always nice to plan it in somewhere in the day, good times guaranteed!
30:06 I'm sat there yelling 'WILSON!' and then up pops the subtitle. Fantastic!
Congrats Tom and crew. Amazing videos and great cause. Thanks for sharing.
i love russ so much. He is so vulgar and inspiring at the same time.
This challenge was legendary well done! The straight line challenges are epic and super hard but this must have been the physically hardest!
What an insane and unique adventure. Loved it!
This deserves to go viral. I've now watched both episodes, and you inspired me to run my first timed 5k this morning. Thank you for making the most entertaining content I've seen on youtube.
So how long until he pulls a Forrest Gump and runs across the US?
Sam the Camera Man (it is Sam right?) is actually GOATed. Ran his first marathon after a previous 10km best? With camera gear too. What a Chad.

Dude you surprise me every time more than the previous! lovely crew also, and very emotional videos! nice job everyone!
I never would have thought a guy I found on YouTube a couple years ago, who's making funny geoguessr videos would be such an inspiration some day. Well done mate
I legitimetly cried at the end of this video. You're an inspiration to so many Tom, a total warrior and with the absolute heart of gold that makes you my favourite YouTuber. Keep on making everyone smile, cry, laugh and just keep on adventuring man! Much Love
..something that people get wrong is that pedestrians are supposed to walk INTO oncoming traffic, in other words on the right... so that you can see cars coming your way.. if there is a bend rendering the lane invisible then swap sides..
Mate you have done it, once again! Well done!  Even if I did speek a better english, i guess i would not find the good words to expres the feelings you are giving us through your adventures!  Hope, love, tenacity, surpassing onself, and many more very positiv things! Thank you from Switzerland!
KING
Congratulations man, such an achievement! Would of been amazing even without the ball but the fact that you did it kicking the ball the whole way truly is a feat of a lifetime.
I am a very unfit 32 year old but Watching you makes me wanna get active again and aim to join you on one of these mad adventures one day was interested in this one but knew In my current state I would be more of a hindrance than any help keep smashing it 💯💯💯👊🏼
31:36  What a great vibe going on, especially with Lilac Orchard playing in the background. Congrats Tom and the rest 👏👏👏
Insane mate, Gratz!!
Congratulations Tom and the team. It's great seeing what can happen when people work together.
Perfect timing!
unreal. phenomenal. one in a lifetime experience, cheers tom, made the wife and kids cry. jokes aside this is absolutely mental and i'm happy you enjoyed and achieved the sole purpose of your trip. big up sonny the ball, and the support crew, have a great one tom
take a shot each time they say ball
Awesome work!  You got the preparation right, you got a good team together, and you had the luck when you needed it. But above all YOU did it! You're a legend Tom!  So, the obvious next step is a straight-line mission with a ball! so have you picked a country yet?
IDEA 💡💡AUCTION OFF THE BALL FOR MONEY FOR CHARITY 😱😃😃😃😃😃😃
Massive congratulations man well done, what an inspiration, sat here bawling
I like Russ
Terrific effort. Well done to you and your crew. Great memories for you. what life's about.
Spot on, 2-4 am your body is like (time so sleep) but when the sun comes up you get a real rush and suddenly you aren't tired anymore. The early hours of the morning are just a really special time for me.
ABSOLUTE LEGEND
mate youre a fucking legend! what a film, what a crew and all for a great cause. started watching you in the early geoguessr days and youre by far my favourite creator online. without even knowing you, you feel like a mate. absolute legend tom!
Mate that's absolutely insane. Allow me to virtually shake your hand and express my congratulations as well as my gratitude for creating these amazing videos.
What a great achievement! Grats
I really thought you had no chance. My apologies. This is an utterly insane feat to achieve, bloody well done to all involved. It is bonkers what the human body can do
kinda cool how "geowizard" applies to a lot of these real world challenges too
You did it well done
You've gone and done it! Congrats on another successfully adventure! With some amazing weather and a top notch support crew you made it look almost easy! Props to all of you. What a wonderful adventure while raising some money for some important causes! Always keep pushing the impossible Tom!
Epic, emmotional and inspirational. Congratulations to you & your team. Superb content. Take that, nowadays TV!
This is the most dudes rock video on this godforsaken website.
Congratulations  Btw this is good reminder that humans are insane when you need to run long distances. All other animals would probably die from overheating.
Congratulations Tom, that's an incredible achievement.  Not to forget, congratulations to the team for sticking with each step of this crazy journey. Well done to all of you.
Absolutely fucking incredible mate
Congratz
You're an absolute legend, Tom!! Cheers to your great team as well!
Sign: “welcome to Northumberland”  Tom: “that’s a welcome sign”
You made this mental challenge look super easy - practically a walk in the (huge) park that is England
the likes to views on this video are (understandably) insane
Buncha good blokes.
Bloody awesome, what an achievement.
Tom, you're the best kind of weird. Well done!
Yeah I had a bit of a cry too there. These video's were really well done, the experience really came to live. Congrats on the amazing achievement!
Inspirational. Good job!
You and your team are fucking incredible! Dont stop there it seems like youve only just started
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR LIKE A MONTH IT FEELS
For this kind of high priority trips I would recommend switching to tactical foodpacks. They are freeze dried and thus more expensive, but they have been created with input from a special forces operator, and they are actually freaking good. Even on a bad day you'd enjoy that.
i can't believe a person's body can do this 😅 i don't think I've ever walked more than 20 miles in a day! impressive and inspiring.
11:39 "As the blood red colors of the deep early hours began to garnish the night's sky..." that's legitimately poetic. You have a knack for words, man. That's one of the little things that make this channel brilliant!
you should have used a glow in the dark ball
"He died what he loved doing -- Dribbling a football in-and-out of traffic." -Norm Macdonald
Wow what a story! I thought it might be good but honestly one of the best ever!
Amazing effort! If I was ever going to do something like this Russ is the one I'd want next to me ! Great company is what pushes you through.
Amazing
well done tom
What a video. Just brilliant. Thank you Tom & Support crew for something truly special. I'd love to see you do more stuff with this team! It felt like even if you didn't complete the goal, it didn't matter because ultimately, it was the Journey that was special.
The music went hard - Spectacular mission, what an adventure ⚽
U gained a new support crew regardless! What a ledge

Imagine my life without knowing about this channel. You've provided us with absolute top tier entertainment and content and you continue to inspire. Thank you for everything!
Get in!!! Congrats Tom and crew!! Tom, you are truly a badass!!!!! Thanks for taking us along on your adventures!
Wow Tom, well played man, you nailed it!  And SERIOUS props to the cameraman, considering he's not as versed in running as the rest of you, and with all that weight on one arm, my god man! 😲
wonderful video tom
Always love what you're doing mate. Can't wait for another adventure!
Congratulations guys!
Congratulations from Rotterdam!
Wow, just wow! Unreal!
I'm just back from Amsterdam, recovering in bed - this is perfect content!
I hope you do more of these maybe Lands end to john o grotes Or maybe Like Lagos to China which i think is the longest you can travel ?
Fair play Tom and the boys, that is seriously impressive and all for a great cause. Cracking job 👌
Absolutely Amazing, it's inspiring to see someone take on such a ridiculous and seemingly impossible challenge and to see them succeed because they stuck with it and didn't give up. I kicked the like button now it's the donate buttons turn. Edit: scored a hat-trick on the donate buttons.
Formal complaint.....  I like to watch these with my children.  We're big fans. But why do we need to have all the swearing subtitled?   🤬
LETSS GOOOO
6:55 as a former Bigband-bassist, I felt that.

This was legendary buddy. You and your crew killed it!

Hell yeah Part two lets go!
It's very deceptive with how suddenly you will be completely out of energy when doing an extreme march like this. My longest has been 100km and at around 80 I stopped eating, thinking I've got this in the bag and just wanted to get it over with. At 95km I damn near collapsed, needed to eat and rest for 15 minutes to be able to pick myself up.   The 2 AM dip in energy that Russ is talking about is also very real and if you ever want to know what true euphoria feels like, you will feel it after 50 miles of walking when you see the sun coming up.
Congrats, continuously the best content on YouTube, and it just gets better.
Love it, love it, love it.  So sorry to hear about your old mucker, but my money will be going to Calm for dark personal reasons.
Congrats, Tom. You're amazing.
Very high quality video. Thanks GeoWizard
This is kind of surreal, im from germany, and we for a while had this youtuber 100km in 24h challenge going on, and like 80% of people failed it lol, and Tom just shoots out a quick 120km in 21 and a half hours with a Football JEZUZ
2:37 you're an absolute wordsmith
You did it! Unbelievable!
Can't describe what a joy this was to be a part of. Please folks, keep donating for these unbelievable causes.
Loved it well done
Idea: maybe as a finale to the series, I think you should try auctioning the ball off online and sending that money to the charities. Great work Tom
This was amazing!!! Loved it. You deserve all the praise and admiration everybody in the comments is giving you (and ofcourse you're amazing team)
That toffee crisp in the van reminded me of my raving days for some reason :)
Absolut legend Tom! Keep it up and running! Finding your videos on YouTube has been a truly lucky day
good job! the fact this content is free and it helps others is just amazing. congratulations on your journey's success, but moreover on your humanity. Good on your parents for creating such a humble and unique individual. Cheers!
crazy who would have thought??????!!!
What a result! Congratulations Tom and the team. As always, the storytelling was also 10/10 - both episodes had me hooked start to finish!
Brilliant.  Never doubted you.
Well done Tom, mad respect to you! 👏
Legend 👊
The IRL videos are so good. You should do a straight line mission in Denmark 👍
Insanity! Love your content Tom, I'm sorry about your mate. Some people are just cruel and love to hurt others :(
GET IN! Your channel has come so far from the no webcam geoguesser days. You're an absolute legend and an inspiration!
I loved every bit of these wholesome and inspiring series. What an absolute legend you and your mates are!
Edit: spoilers!!!!    Great work tom! Really really well done, you did something really physically and mentally hard to help those who are struggling physically and mentally. You trained for it and you absolutely crushed it. You are doing good things for this world, whether it’s a wholesome geoguesser video to give us some entertainment and use our brains to think, or it’s a massive mission, whether you succeed or not. Even just coming back to the people who were waiting for you at the finish line is an action that speaks louder than words towards your character.  Cheers, Massachusetts USA
the area of the uk is only 3/5 th of the area of california, crazy
Sausage party! Yay!
07:53 That‘s a toad, not a frog 😉
AMAZING!! you are hero my friend <3
You're an absolute legend, mate! I could write a whole paragraph but that's too much. Good charities, too!
Can't believe I doubted you, Tom. I'm glad I get to eat my words from the video when you first mentioned attempting this. Absolutely mad
Amazing, Tom!  Way to proof all those naysayers in the comments wrong, you did it man!
Mate I’m absolutely chuffed to bits for you. More than the straight line missions, to do this for charity to remember your friend, probably makes this all the more rewarding and satisfying to complete. Never mind the fact that you actually completed it with no genuine errors and got to the finish line ahead of schedule. Congratu-frggin’-lations!
amazing Tom!
Please never change the music, its a classic now ❤️
I'm tired just watching it
You all are incredible. What a video. What a journey. Congratulations to all of you.
Fucking epic is what this is!
Amazing stuff, Tom!
what a legend
Glow in the dark ball might have been advisable
Well done man, great effort.  When you want to do Scotland again, shout me.  I work offshore and do 2 on 2 off so i've big chunks of time available.  Im a rope access supervisor and have loads of paddle boards and kit and could set up some abseils, climbs etc so your straight line route could maybe tackle some mad sh#t.  Happy to rig all the gear, do some training so its all in place when you encounter a cliff or crag and you just clip in and go.  Add a spicy new element to the straight line caper.  Slainte, Ewan
You probably could auction off the ball for charity. I rather suspect it'd raise some cash. Just some food for thought. Congrats!
Amazing work man.
Hats off to you and your team!  What an achievement!  I could see this gaining international recognition and perhaps 1 day, there will be the annual GeoWizard crossing challenge.  Very impressive.
Great video, great cause, great guy you are. Love you tom
What a bloody good bloke. Good on ya Tom.
lets go tom and crew!!
Nothing short of incredible!!
nice!
Such an amazing adventure, what a wonderful crew, loved every minute of it!
"This is where most people quit" - After kicking a ball for 80 kilometers.
watchi g this video before it gets taken down for copyright strike
The vibes section genuinely made me laugh
This series just reinforces my conviction that you need to do an adventure with Beau Miles someday
Just amazing, inspirational, emotional. Great video.
You're a legend, and you're only getting warmed up
Been checking  everyday  for part 2. Massive congratulations Tom & your crew. Had no doubt you would do it.
love you man....CONGRATULATIONS
Love the content!  Hope the music doesn't get you a strike on your channel!
Congratulations Tom and the rest of the team 🙂
Get this man a knighthood!
Amazing!! One of the best videos i have seen! Congrats to all the crew and Tom! Amazing achievement for a great cause!!
What an effort and what a team
Beautiful. Smashed it.
That is not the coast of England
As much as I enjoyed that, part of me was slightly hoping someone was going to run up and two foot tackle him at the finish line.
not really across the country because you stoped before the true opposite coast
Well done!👍
shoutout to the cameraman
legends, simply legends mate...
What a fantastic adventure tom! I can’t wait for more! Serious kuddos to such an epic support crew!
Actually thoroughly impressed. Well done.
Congrats
Tom, we're so happy for you. Absolutely nailed it mate! Yam a lovely lad.
Amazing Tom, cheers!
Amazing, this should go down as one of YouTube's landmark moments along with Hbomberguy's Donkey Kong stream and others I can't think of right now. Absolute mad lads, congrats!
Congrats good sir! I know this was probably the hardest thing you have ever done. If I was local to you I would have personally showed up at the finish ti shake your hand, give you a hug and buy you a drink!
This is what YT is all about. its wonderful, its inspirational and sometimes it gets weird. Well done mate!
Great episode,  well done!
Whats next? Juggeling 5 bowlingballs across antarctica?  Good job!!!
Hats off to you Tom. I underestimated you, and I'm glad you proved me wrong ! Please continue to be yourself on this channel.
SPOILERS   ligma balls
Congrats Man. To you and your Team. You're such a good guy, just keep it up!
Superb effort, well done you and everyone involved
....Brilliant.
An adventure of gargantuan proportions, and an achievement to match whether or not you were to make it in 24 hours. Well done Tom and crew! Donate if you can guys. RIP Jim x
13:05 Russell didn't start as far as the map shows, he started his journey from Istanbul
Well done mate!
Loved it mate!
Thanks Tom.
YES!!! That was awesome!! So happy for you. Keep doing the impossible!!
What an amazing trek!  Amazing cause, and amazing of you to give a bird update :-)
Well done Tom!! ⚽️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃
Where no Roman dared to go mate. They built it for a reason :)
camera MAN STAN in the VAN eating SCRAN
Man, you are such an inspiration for me, and I know for a fact a lot other people as well. You have made something extremely hard, and for that I look up to you. I have been following you since 2019, when you uploaded the straight line mission, and since then all of your adventures have inspired me, from "How to _NOT_ Travel Europe" – to all you straight line missions – to THIS.   I want to be like you when I get older and end school, however, being a top 1 percentile student makes it hard to focus on almost anything other than school and of course your channel, to see what you're up to. I really hope there's room for a year off studying, so that I can perform some adventures, without totally sabotaging my future career.
Humans are crazy
Mate, this was amazing to watch. I don't know how you did it, just thinking about it makes me feel sick.
Love your videos mate. Massive congrats to you and all of your crew on yet another amazing achievement!
the goat youtuber
An epic and noble undertaking Tom.   I'm surprised this didn't make national press, especially since it was for such a worthy cause.
The ginger is annoying!
4:26 the swoosh of the leg was so precise
I think you've made Coldplay proud with that incredible acapella :)
Thanks again for all your incredibly generous donations everyone. Don’t forget if you can’t afford to donate, simply drop this video a like and help raise more awareness.
Man that was mental, but you took it like a champ and finished the mission! Job well done :)
calling it now, best 2 part seires on youtube

Amazing
Tom telling inanimate objects to "fuck off" is one of my favourite things on the tinterweb.
👑
Woo i really needed this vid today! After an extra hard day's work I needed a nice youtube vid to wind down with before bed
Rip James. Sad story, entirely needless death.
This was awesome, couldn't help but tear up a little at the end.
Legend
You are an example Tom. Thank you.
Absolutely amazing! It is so nice to see you have such good people around you. You are a champ!
Well fucking done, mate.
Came believe you made me sit through 80 mins of footage before telling me what happened to the bird. Unbelievable.   But on a real note. Amazing job Tom. Should be proud of yourself.
GG.
Absolutely incredible, good job :)
Well done Tom and crew
Chuffed for you mate. And to finish in my home town also. Couldn't come out to meet you due to work- but i am delighted for you and your team. Your mum must have been so proud.
this is the perfect thing to sit and watch with a beer. thanks man, evening made
Loved the video, definitely gave off British Bo Miles vibes.
What's the first song they listened to ? I know I've listened to it a lot but forgot what it's called
Congratulations on being the best creator on YouTube. Inspirational.
GIVE US MORE. MORE MORE MORE!!! More crazy adventures, preferably in miserable weather, in the dark up a mountain. Alone??
This was utterly incredible to watch, loved every moment. Think it might be my favourite adventure on the channel. Thanks for giving me 2 minutes outside the pub as well (I'll definitely come in for a next time), was lovely to meet you. Very much looking forward to the next challenges!  I hope as a community we can continue to raise as much as possible, so we can have an impact. Congratulations again Tom, and to the rest of the team as well.
that was fucking great
you mad lad you did it!!! i didn't think it can be done, but you actually did it! huuuuge CONGRATS!
Did not expect to be this emotional but that is the most beautiful ending. Can’t really put into words how hard this hit me, from the overall goal of the project to seeing this level of friendship and camaraderie. You’re a legend. Cheers from Canada.
You guys are absolute legends - all of you! Not for setting goals, achieving or failing but just because you are who you are. i find that very inspirating, wholesome and lovely. Y'all gave a big smile and a good feeling on a not so good day! Greetings from germany lads
This was an epic W
When you hit the wall / the bonk  it feels like you'll never make it every single time.  Eat and eat and eat !
Another banger. Welldone good sir 🔥
Cheers mate
You, sir, are an absolutely superb human being. Congratulations!
How you did it, I do not know. But that was amazing.
Those step-overs are lethal, is it Agüero or Tom Davies I’m watching?
Well done Tom, awesome achievement 👏
Don't worry about it. I also get my 6s and 9s jumbled up, which makes for some pretty disappointing sexual encounters.
This deserves a guinness world record, don't you think?
Congrats Tom - all the way from New Mexico!
Well Done Tom! Amazing Result
Well done everyone involved :D That ball deserves signing by everyone too.
i didnt follow the whole thing, but why did he finish in the downtown? Doesnt across Britain mean coast to coast so he'd have to finish at the east coast? not that it matters much just curious
it's here! it's here! it's here! i was waiting for this so eagerly, literally going to your channel every hour to check up, I love everything about this, so much love from India, hoping you'd soon start making geo guesser India videos ❤️❣️❤️
Great job ! You are a legend!
Congrats to all involved in this epic challenge.  Never had any doubt that you'd do it
You inspire me every day to work towards becoming a person I can be proud of
Congrats to you all on a fantastic mission well done!!
Maryland!
I was looking forward to this the whole week <3
Only Rus can say “I could do it again right now” after 100k without anyone doubting him.
absolutely amazing, allways remember you can do anything if you put your mind to it. Have a great Day!
My God, this could easily have been a "skateboarding across Britain" attempt instead, I see.
Maryland
With some of these marvelous videos as a resume, I’m sure you’d qualify for the dreaded Barkley Marathon.
I love your Chanel bro you make me laugh when times are though
This is great, but at the whole section around 23:18, you're about 2mi from my house, but running down a main road an not the Hadrian's Wall path which is literally just on the other side of the road, well-walked, and 100% safe. Is it explained somewhere why you chose the road? Seems a crazy decision from my perspective having run this bit of the wall path countless times.
Amazing! Well done for doing so well!
What an epic accomplishment, Tom! Congratulations. This is truly inspiring.
Bothers me so much how they always keep the car running? Why lol
I wasn't expecting how excited I'd be to watch you approach that final bridge. Much respect to you and the whole crew, you've done an outstanding job. And congratulations!
Just me or did that beard at 26:48 come out of nowhere?
10/10 for cameraman stan
This should do every Austrian premier league footballer!!
Just wanted to say that your videos have inspired me to go out there with no fears and I've been feeling so much better ever since. Great work, thank you so much!
I wonder if cameraman got leg cramps after this as the least experienced one in the group
didnt wathc yet but geatr vvid man
We need more videos like these on youtube, so tired of the corporate channels just seeking views ignoring any sort of quality
Yay!
keep up the good work, huge inspiration to so many people
RIP that guy who got murdered :(
No dented cars in this episode which is refreshing
Get it in.
Mate, i think youre really underselling how insanely impressive it is that after 118 you can manage a light jog. thats incredible.
This is like Forrest Gump and Cast Away combined. WILSON!!!
here before this hits a million views
Tom will forever be the maddest of lads
Comment for the YT algorithm
Yet another brilliant one. Well done Tom (and crew of course!). Now looking forward to your US trip, as how not to travel europe still is my favourite of them all.
The birthday cake was such a British moment
YES
*Crossing England, not Britain*
Let’s gooooo I have been looking forward to it, as always of course!!
Legend!
Your videos are always very uplifting,. Great job.
ohhh, I was waiting for this.
Before I see the video. Care less if he made it. It was totally "GRIND" on his part. And I would like to thank him. I will donate for the effort. Now on with the video. Thanks again everyone involved. USA Florida fan.
Thank fuck. Something sane to watch.
"campaign against living miserably" I wish I didn't...
Madlad!

Already donated after the amazing first episode. Had to donate again right away after this one. Fair play to ya mate. Would love to buy you a pint!
Inspiring!! Greetings from Germany. Stay healthy and keep on!   by the way ... I am learning English by watching your videos :D
Oh yeah

get in
Well done lad!
Generally made me cry with this. Possibly you're best adventure yet. Congratulations!
Spoilers  That there was an absolutely legendary effort! When you first mentioned this plan it sounded absolutely insane, but you and your all-star lineup completely smashed it.
This was so good. Your crew was amazing!!! People please blow this up!!!
I'm so glad I joined the Patreon. I couldn't wait till tomorrow's lunch
I never doubted you for a second! You are a madlad and i truly am in awe of your doer attitude.
What an absolute pleasure it was to be a part of this team. A birthday I’ll never forget. I look forward to being back on the trails with you all again. I hope everyone enjoys watching these videos as much as we did making them, and thank you to everyone who has donated. If you are currently struggling with anything then I'd like to think this video can help be some form of motivation to keep moving forward. Much love x
I don't know about you, ladies and gents, but I'm pumped about the future series "How Not to Dribble Across an Entire Continent in a Completely Straight Line".
What an amazing series, quite possibly my new favorite of yours. While the other solo and even brother/Welsh Greg adventures were incredible, the cast of characters you built with this series is absolutely brilliant.   And all for a number of worthwhile causes. Big ups to you, Tom.
SPOILERS     Congrats man! This is an unreal achievement. I seriously didn't think you'd be able to do it, but you absolutely crushed it! So, what's next? Straight line mission in 24 hours while dribbling a ball? 😉 Anyway, can't wait to see your next adventure!
Well done
True heroes kick a football
Dissapointed that there was no "are we recording" in this series... Jokes aside, well done Tom amazing stuff.
absolute legend
You’ve outdone yourself once again, Tom. I knew all those years ago when I first discovered your GeoGuessr videos that you’d have potential to be one of my favourite content creators, but I couldn’t have predicted you’d become THE all-time favourite.  Congrats on an incredible achievement to you and the whole team!
Appreciate the effort and work put into this!
Really enjoyed this one Tom! When that guy said "you're an inspiration" I hope you took it to heart, I know he spoke for many of us. Between you and Beau Miles you've helped me turn my life around and find joy in pushing limits, Get In!
These two videos have been so inspiring - unbelievable. Great work Tom and the rest of the crew. A proper team effort.
absolutely brilliant tom, never change the pace with which your ambitions push you forward
Amazing Tom! Not only is running the distance an incredible achievement, in the time and with a ball is simply crazy. You're an inspiration, to keep running, to keep exploring and to keep having fun with your mates.   Cheers for this, and all the other great adventures and thanks for sharing them with us!
Spoiler     Big shoutout to camerman stan casually running a couple marathons having never done more than 10k. What a legend.  And well done to tom and the whole crew. Anything is possible!!
Seeing all the confused Geordies was the best part 1000% Epic journey mate!
Legend. Bonkers, but amazing!
Well in Tom, fantastic cause and sentiment, on top of that amazing support team. Very well delivered, huge congratulations to you all👏
congrats Tom & crew, awesome!
Why am I so addicted to this channel?
The purpose, the adventure, the editing, everything is just wonderful. Great job guys!
Tom you absolute legend!! Well done mate
Fucking legend mate! You and the whole crew! Hats off to everyone from Hungary!
Brilliant 👍
Spoilers  You're an absolute legend Tom! Well done and congratulations on successfully completing the mission but also for all the money you've raised for the charities.
Absolutely unreal Tom, you've made some of my favourite videos on YouTube but I reckon this one tops them all. The mental and physical strength to pull this off is immense and you not only succeeded in the goal but made it into such a touching and inspirational video. Major props to the support crew too, especially my mate cameraman stan.
Inspiring and beautiful video. GeoWizard videos makes me love humanity and the world we live in!
Just finished watching... Tom you've actually made me cry, I'm not ashamed to admit it. What a fantastic tale, fantastically narrated by yourself.  You're such an inspiration with your adventures, whether you succeed in reaching your goal or not.  Cheers, sir. I'll have a central Illinois pint and raise my glass in your direction this evening!
8:46 ayo young Ben what the actual fuck. That adrenaline must have been through the god damn roof, if that was me I would have died mid air
Tom, I've been a YouTube power user for over 13 years now (a bit embarassing to be honest). I have basically grown up with this site, having watched tens of thousands of videos. (........wish I was lying)  You are my absolute, by a fucking long shot, favourite creator. Not only are you a geniunely humble, charismatic and fun dude, but also such a wonderful entertainer. Each new video of yours catches my interest like no other. I always look forward to anything GeoWizard.  You're a true role model. Someone to look up to. I will support you forever man, you can believe that.   Tl;dr: I fucking love you, man. Cheers
Cheers lads!
Brilliant! This was so much fun to watch, congratulations! Also, had no idea the camera guy from Better Call Saul was joining you!
what happened to the dunk at new castle
SPOILERS     I've been one of the doubters, I didn't comment or anything, but thought that along that seriously long way, there must be something that'll stop you and it might not even be your own body. But I'm so happy that you did it! Thank you for doing this and never change your spirit.
This is one of the best and most heartfelt videos I've ever seen on YouTube. Thanks Tom for inspiring so many us.
Amazing!  what an achievement.  well done lads and lasses....❤❤❤❤
Mate, you've had me crying for real. This is the most beautiful thing you've done so far. Thank you!
Needed this tonight thanks.
its so cool how this series is coming out just as Cody Ko is completing an ultra marathon
I’ve been waiting for this vid for so long
SPOILERS  It's hard to describe the feelings of joy and satisfaction I get while watching these adventure and mission videos, I guess its something about setting a steep goal and watching it get conquered and accomplished. Amazing cause, crew, mission, and narration. Simply brilliant!
love it, big up the camera man, think he had one of the hardest jobs here with the equipment needed to carry. well done all
Naming US states my arse, you were thinking of cookies
SPOILERS!     Congratulations mate, you did an amazing job! I never thought I'd see it, it sounded insane but you pulled it off with hours to spare. That victory party was wonderful, if you ever do some crazy mission in the Netherlands I'd love to join you at the pub.
Bloody incredible. Have a great time in america!
Congrats again. And it was a pleasure to meet you at the end and to have a pint with you. I'm glad I could be a part of it however small it was haha
So excited for this! I'm really happy to support you as a creator Tom!
Fucking tears in my eyes when the speaker came out and the vibes carried you all
Been waiting for this! 😍
7:53 BEST PART
7:52 : That's a toad, mate
