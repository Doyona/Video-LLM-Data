Commentary everywhere is trash
Solid effort by Izzy, respect to him for moving up and testing himself at LHW 👏👏👏🫡
oh please. Adesanya had that fight in the bag till the last minute. had the fight gone any longer. trust me. blachowics would have loos because he gazed out already. but . not to take anything from blachowicks . he did fight a smart fight and for that. I give credit. as for my brother ADESONYA., he stepped up and put on a good show. but . one can't just win every time. we all got to take the good with the bad sometimes. all and on.  it was a very good fight and two thumbs up to both fighters. they are both simply awesome. and may GOD BLESS them both with good health . AMEN
Izzy is a size bully, just like Conor was. He basically didn’t have much of a reach advantage and also wasn’t able to successfully goad Jan into action like he usually does. His style is really dependent on an aggressor. He’s brought the fight to others , but it’s not his natural style.
Izzy's own reaction is the only one worth watching.
*“Adesanya possibly did enough tonight to become a double champion.” -Jon Anik, the biggest lying shill I’ve ever seen.*
I knew it would be a good fight and I had a high hopes fo him to win but blachowicz like they said size matter Izzy ain’t even light heavyweight that’s his first fight in a heavier division so practically he had a low chase to win
Quite "Izzy" @polishpower
"upset win"? you guy are so fanboying for Adesanya it clouds your judgement lol very professional title lol
USSki don't like Jan from polski, polski bad
Why is this an upset? Jan is naturally heavier, if he connects it's going to drain Izzy. I never saw this as a good match up for Izzy..ever.  Size difference is just about everything in grappling.
How is this an upset? i actually think it worked out perfectly, Izzy got a good welcome to the division now he can work harder
3:22 those cauliflower ears dont seem to hold earbuds that well, right 'bud' ?
Jan👍🏻 UFC Tyson Fury 👍🏻 boxing 🥊 Caucasians are dominating fights and sjws and wakanda (doesn't even exist and never will as people living in that continent are slow) lovers hate it 😭😂 Look at Liberia for example 😝 Europe 😘👍🏻🥊 Europeans and people of European descent the creators of everything we love and know today 😌 Electricity internet cars planes Sports entertainment democracy hospitals and abolished slavery (which Africans started since Egyptian times *facts* 🤯😬😊) you name it Europeans invented it 💜💋
Izzy overhyped...Not like he fought anyone..Whitaker was the best he fought...he just got exposed is all.....as soon as some one gets a belts people call them the best ever seen....horseshit. fight monsters..defend belt for years...now your great.
Izzy Wizzy was so tricky Witty, fizzy with lots of skillzy Breakdancin’ made fans go tizzy Thought he’d win a double chizzi ‘Til the Polish man got busy   Izzy Wizzy got no Jiu-Jitzi!  Now he lookin’ kinda dizzy Can’t double champ, you one dimen-zi! Izzy Wizzy says “No biggie” I say Izzy lost some fizzy   Fightin’ Jones now pretty iffy Jones would smash him in a jiffy He’d maybe last a minute fifty Heavy weight just sounds so silly    Good job Izzy takin’ risky Showed us you sho ain’t no sissy Maybe you jus’ too dam skinny!
Izzy wins... People: "ohh he's so amazing" Izzy loses... People: "oh he's so amazing how he took it with humility, so much respect to him that he even took the fight"  Jan wins... People: ..."yes he's good but respect to Izzy for the way he fought" Jan wins... People: "Izzy's coaches are so humble" Jan wins... UFC: "let's just focus on how great Izzy and his team are, ok!"
Living legend Antony Joshua  also beaten once...!
Very interesting match up Congrats to both fighters!
Gạo chợ,nước sông,củi đồng,nồi đất.
Blachowicz is the champ, but its an upset win?
Only an upset if you’re a casual. Jan smashed the guy who was robbed against John Jones
It was nothing close to upsed
Not sure how it’s an “upset win” seeing how Jan was the champ in his division going into this.. lol.
Upset????
all say Jan is a big guy ok he have 93 kg and Adesanya 91 kg only 2 kilo difference
How is the Champion defending his title against a guy moving up a class  an upset? Smh
Izzie got exposed...no ground game.. Only true upset was there wasn't a k.o. on izzie.. Then commentary was one sided.
I'm no expert , so correct me if I'm wrong but was Izzy not stepping up in weight, if so it is hardly an upset
To me Izzy didn't have the same posture and confidence in the octagon, as he usually does.he looked out of his element
2:44 COCAIN?
Why you talk more about Adesanya lost instead of Jan's win?
Fake empty hype 2 out of 3 fights were disappointments you got easy win by Nunes in her division consisted by 3-4 fighters that is no viable division and there should not be belt there. Second disappointment Sterling losing and acting out somehow ended a champion. Never pay for UFC PPV Sterling acting was worst than WWE
Upset? Izzy got dominated.
I think Jans game plan was on point... He waited till Izzy got a bit tired and think that it was going to be a good old fashion standing fight....
Some of the most biased commentary in UFC history. I'm not sure what Joe & DC saw differently than the viewers at home, but from my seat/view, Jan looked to be even with Izzy's striking and was significantly stronger and controlled Izzy on the ground 100% of the time... If you had just been listening to the commentary that night with no visual reference, you would have thought that Jan was bloodied and cowering every round, but the 4th & 5th rounds.
Jan was feigning and landing and had Adesanya thinking but the commentators said nothing. It was all about Izzy, look what happened?
You have to fight Izzy slow and not allow him to hit you with combos.  Izzy knocks people out with multiple hits but he doesnt really have KO power like that.  Romero couldn't wrestle Izzy because he was too small to be a threat with the stand up.  Jan was big enough to connect with some things and break Izzy down while also taking a page out of Romeros book and being patient.
I hate that narrative that is beeing pushed that Jan won becouse of his size not skill lol like it was his fault izzy went light
Not really an upset
Don’t forget the clown doing the unofficial scoring had Izzy winning 39-37 after 4 rounds. The bias is real.
He thought he could do bones 😂hahahahahaha
Bones would destroy adasanya
Looks like people have more to comment on the commentators than the fight itself???
Man all those after talking so much nonsense  If Izzy wins than ya so nice he was slim and fast & bla bla always is a reason for the win  If you really good analysts tell me all those facts before fight  Anyway good he lost because he became so arrogant and cocky
Its was Mony making  mach noting else  Adesanya can't beat jan Blachowicz  Come on.
Does Chael snort a bunch of coke before interviews like this, jeez relax man.
Kurwa Chuck Norris 😂
Please, many go from 145 to 170, IA isnt the first that dared to be great.  He lost the fight despite all these experts calling it for IA.
It is not a upset . Jan is champ already . The heavyweight champ kicked middleweight champ a** simple as that.
Talk normally Chael you have a fkn microphone, no need to yell... oh and btw please let us know who'll win the next fight... so we can put our money on the opposite person who will no doubt win... That method has worked well for me lately, thanks mate.
Polish Power
Wasn’t really an upset.
I don't know why they keep saying Jan was so much bigger Jan was just the better man that night
3:23 Did Chael cello tape his air pods? 😂
Only in US. If a little guy Will win he have to fight! Israel only was to little! Israel take The lost a man. But listen to this worst voice. Have he lost his ears? I can take him down and whisper shut up
Jan Błachowicz 😍😍😍🇵🇱🇵🇱
Very disappointed in that fight the ufc employees won’t say it out loud but people who watched the fight were waiting for someone to engage both guys were so cautious they didn’t even fight come on 5 rounds and no one got knocked out or severely hurt thumbs down
Another upset because he’s not a loudmouth. Even English dragon felder picked jan “the plow pusher “ blowovich
Polish Power is too legendary.
Anyone who studies fighting should have expected Jan to win. Perhaps the doubters now understand how to beat a counterstriker in the standup.
It would be interesting to know how old Francis Ngannou really is. Overeem once said that he didn't believe that Francis had any real records of his actual date of birth, and was older than he claims to be. Ngannou looks to be at least as old as Yan Blachowicz. Officially, Francis is 34 years old. Somehow that doesn't seem very believable. The point is, with Yan's new very high level championship run at 38 years old, his resume is close to being one of the top resumes in modern MMA. But also, he might have the best resume of any 38 year old fighter in MMA history. Francis Ngannou seems posed to take over the spotlight, as he seems to be getting better and better as he gets older. It's very doubtful that Jones and Adesanya will be fighting championship fights at 38 years old.
Yan actually has very long arms, and long legs. His leg reach is 45" compared to Stipe Miocic's 39" leg reach. Yan has the frame of a true heavyweight. He could do very well at heavyweight. Yan has extremely rare physical gifts. His quiet, humble attitude, makes people not recognize how gifted he is.
People were biased because people want to see the knight beat the beast. The small guy beating the bigger and stronger guy by using the superior technique. The birth of a legend. We wanted to see it.  Although I would be very surprised if Izzy won, I wanted him to win because it would be "the fun outcome". Now, the expected thing happened and it is boring.  Now, I don't think he can ever beat Jon Jones. There is just no way. Jon Jones is a killer.
How much of an upset can it be? Both Champs and one is heavier.
Chael "size matters" Sonnen
Upset win? Lol Jan didn't loose 🤣 😂 😆
Felder is the man. After the biased commentary for Jan vs Izzy, Felder and Bisping have my vote for best Analysts.
Lovve ur fights n Im not fighter  so I concede to u sir maybe the glorius russian bear didnt go for the obvious take down ground n pound cuz a) he respected Izzy 2 much as he shood Iz can kick small trees down with those bats im sure and in the big inning wood be boring to the fans so 2 great reasons to keep it standing were there a few times he Izzy cood of mellon d the big guy?  Yea prolly but he didnt they never disrespected each other Iz wasnt able to pull the trigger cuz the guys a class act n maybe he gave him a win why not that right there is a true warrior both actually are great battle either way
Honestly for my 48-47, The winner is correct but the targets are a bit strages
Gratulacje Panie Janku wszyscy w szoku
Chael Sonnen: "Jan noticed that Israel didnt have that power, wasnt that much of a threat" Jan Blachowicz:"Israel had more power than I expected, but he was slower than expected" Great take Chael...
Brother Israel Dana White UFC stole that fight from you they actually stole it from you you always a winner in our eyes
Jan was better in all aspects. That’s it.
Jan’s just a better + stronger fighter right now
What upset win are you talking about.. good grief mate   !!
How was it an upset?
What upset ? may be Jan not KOing Adesanya ? well thats an upset to me !
An upset??? That’s ridiculous
"Upset win". Yeah, ESPN.....
He’s too big
Stop calling it an upset. People are dumb. Jan was the champ, they were fighting in his division. He was the bigger guy, Izzy winning would be an upset.
“Size Matters” that’s what she said
i heard from a friend that jan said the fight was too izzy
Upset win are you serious??? Jan was easy money to win
As an Izzy fan, this definitely wasn’t an upset. Jan’s scary af and traded with Izzy really well actually outstriking him most of the time. Izzy took a risk and it didn’t pay off, but none of the middleweights could’ve done half of what he did that night
Who said it was an upset
Why is it called an upset? Izzy is the one who moved up, the upset would have been if Jan lost.... sheesh... Izzy can beat him though I believe
Its amazing jan is 38
I hate the underdog thing. I know he was undefeated but if you are a real MMA fan you knew that this was a possibilty. Izzy's first fight showed that when he was taken down multiple times and if not for a tired fighter may have lost his ufc debut. All real fans were worried about this fight for him. Knowing the power Jan has and knowing that since he's be the heavier man he'd probably try a few take downs. Stop this narrative!
BLACHOWICZ WINS JONES VS BLACHOWICZ
It wasnt an upset win, it was a reality check for Izzy. Jones would probably pulverize him after seeing what Janek did.
Lol “upset.” Only the casuals called this an upset.
It was no upset
No upset here .. Jan was $3.10 to win .. Easy money.. Yippee.. Polish Power Baby... LMAO
It was no upset!! This bs Jan took him down 3 rounds come on
BRAWO MISTRZU BRAWO JAN
Coming from Izzy fan, it was a really nice fight to watch. I really enjoyed watching and can prob learn a lot from it as well. Both are awesome fighters!
Upset win? Don't make me laugh ESPN. Big champion beat smaller champion - that's about it. Adesanya is lucky Jan ran out of time, otherwise the fight could have been stopped. The whole MMA world is as deluded as he is.
Ok chael? Yoel the beat wrestler in mma? Lay off whatever you are taking
What else could Izzy do but to be humble? He got held down on his back for 2 rounds exposed what everybody gives Izzy credit for, take down defense, now he knows he can be taken down, his sniper like striking is great, but the knock out he suffered in his great kick boxing career makes him just enough gun shy, he doesn't like getting socked in his face so he leans backwards which makes his head and shoulders leans way back off balance behind his legs which if timed right, he can be taken down almost all the time,the great wrestlers took note of this guaranteed!
Does anybody believe that Izzy took this fight to challenge himself, or he probably thought this would be a relatively easy win with picking him apart, Beginning of the fight Izzy didn't look like he respected Jan, he was getting pretty close with faints, Izzy took this fight to get another belt and boost his status as the best in the business, he didn't anticipate Jan's championship mentality and ability
Honestly I think that kelvin gastelum has been the only big trouble for Izzy
Its not an upset..Jan is calm..cou terpunch effectively and very strong
Can't believe this is an upset, Jan was the champion yet him winning is a upset.
How can the current champion winning be called an upset? he defended the title. The upset would be if he lost.
I don't get why its a surprise Jan won? Dudes a beast.
Chael ruins everything with his stupid high-pitched voice...
It wasn't an upset. Jan should've been the favorite. It was the obvious outcome
Spierdalajcie jeśli wygrana Janka jest smutna
"Upset win"? Come on..Jan is a great champion in every sense of the word. Give him his FULL credit, it's LONG overdue!!
very simple in first rounds izzy would have mora energy to fight those take downs thats why Jan did it 4 and 5... He and his coaches are very long in this game and understands those things - pure mma
Not an upset win, no surprise to anyone except for nut huggers.
Bahahahha upset? He was better. End of story. Those who are upset, don't have a clue about fighting sports and their comments mean less than my morning s**t. Byeeeeee.
Paul Felder you the man ! Love your analysis
”Adesanya loses for the first time in his professional career” 🤦‍♂️
That was an upset ? Jan winning.
No Way can anyone call this a unexpected win.
Jan is good no doubt but I'm sure also size helped him to take izzy down
What a shitty vid title ... it was not an “upset win”!
Jan didn't win that fight without ko ,he take him down wow , got some hits , so what !!!
Fvck Chael
Upset win ?......not an Izzy fan here
I'm no MMA professional and I knew Jan was gonna get the victory without much trouble ✅
An upset ??  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 stop please stop ,Blachowiz  is a monster an Adesanya he's a bummer ,a little sisie
Upset win!?
Izzy got a piece of his own medicine as he is used to facing opponents with shorter reach bcoz of his long skinny frame which makes him look great in striking... looks like he actually isn't that much better than others at striking when partnered with a guy who have the same reach as him..
Why was it an upset win? They really thought Adesanya could've won that fight? smh
Upset? How so?
upset?
I wouldn’t call that a upset
Izzy for the first time fought in the light heavyweight division and stood the champion for all five rounds and until the take downs, Jan was fatigue and that's true.
This is why I put money down on is he losing. I just knew he was biting off more than he could chew. I respect him so freaking much more than ever before that he took on the challenge. Huge fan of him now. He did not retire in his prime. Henry Cejudo John Jones Izzy those three are the best champs. They wiped out a division and went looking for the next biggest challenge
WHEN CHAEL SPEAKS, I ALREADY KNOW STUPIDITY IS COMING
Izzy was never hurt in the fight.  If  Could have stopped those take downs he would have won the fight.  Jan had great defense and the timing of the takedowns we're good.  Should have been 48-47 on all three.
Sterling the SCUMBAG type o guy,,,,,,,,,,
How can a middle weight champ losing to a light heavy weight (also a world champ) be a upset??? . .i would have called Adesanya winning an upset.
B's weight was too much.  Adessanya was tired in the later rounds, as he stated that his body couldn't handle B. B did an excellent job sticking to his game plan
Izzy made the worst mistake a fighter can make, he let his ego override physics.  Izzy should have fought lessor light-heavy weights in order to build his frame.
I’m a 250 pound wet blanket of a blue belt 😂
Gustafson v Jan or Glover and den.....,...Rakic.I want to see Gus have a shot at that title when Jon Jones ain't in the way. That man deserves to be a champion
Who gets the winner of Jan v Grover?Rakic needs a shot but out of anybody I would love to see Gus get a shot at it. I just think that he deserves to be a champion I know he's had his chances. Who do you think deserves it and who do you think you would like to watch get a shot
Do you think Izzy would have done better if he came in weighing 185? I kind of think it would he looked pretty lethargic at times
Jan outclassed Izzy even while standing up. He delivered way more strikes if you look at statistics, and this has nothing to do with strength and size.
Great and concise summary. In all of pre-fight predictions, there was no mention of Blachowicz extensive background as a kick-boxer. The only advantage Izzy has was range and a little speed which caused Jan a bit of a problem at the beginning and he was a bit too gun-shy. When he rectified that and threw in the takedowns it paid off. Nobody mentions either now, that at the end Izzy was mounted and unlikely to get out and probably would have been submitted, had the time allowed.
Chael size mattress 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Izzy took the wrong approach with his size on this fight. Let’s see what he does next at 185
i hate that people are calling this an "upset" win for jan smh
This was no upset. Izzy got mauled by a Polish bear. How hard is it fir these morons to choke on the millions they lost betting on IZZY. "POLISH POWER BABY"
WHY UPSET?
Most biased commentary in any UFC title fight?
I’m convinced ppl need something to complain about. Jan won and ppl are mad about the commentary lmao. Who gives af?
That fight was soo fkn boring
I've zChsel he s the man ,but when he said Izzy win I was like nooooo! He always gets it wrong.but polish power,show Izzy didn't, bloke KO,s people went 5rounds had its as just lost.but weight wish he put on.creati g history No1 best him Yan . Not much in it .fan's hope u see rest of Izzy's carrerr,just started.
Chael Sonnen with his usual clown takes
izzy too cautious, hats off to jan anyways
How bad was the commentating
I don’t feel like either fighter truly lost this fight . Jan took rounds 4-5 obviously but for the cards to score the rounds Jan 4 to Izzy 1 is ridiculous . I don’t feel either fighter won the fight and it would’ve been hard for me as a judge to give either of them a loss on their records . I was also pretty surprised that Jans hits didn’t seem to effect Izzy as everyone thought they would . Many thought if Jan could land one good hit it would be over .
This guy is way better then stephen a smutt
“Upset win” HE WAS/IS THE CHAMPIONwow lmao people kill me
Was this really such an upset? Seemed like it could go either way to me. I guess it was more one-sided than I expected but the outcome was far from shocking.
The vacuous brochure cumulatively embarrass because afghanistan bareilly hook till a next pen. rambunctious, impartial east
The judges were on crack that night
A lot of people expect Jan to get more respect because he beat Adesanya, it might not happen. He is not your average super star kinda guy, he is a good fighter but does he have the star factor? Can Jan walk into a room and control the room? The UFC needs to make money to stay afloat and reach more folks and Jan ain't the guy(sadly), a fight between Izzy and Jon would still make more ppv today than a Jan vs Jon. So for all who think Jan is not respected enough, it has nothing to do with his skills, it has a lot to do with charisma and crowd control.
I never thought izzy would win He just isnt big enough for the division, he's gonna have to bulk up..
Chael is a try hard clown. Not one bit funny
upset win ! what am i missing here. Adesanya got humbled which was needed. Jan was always gonna win ffs.
It was no upset it was exactly what I thought would happen he can't handle the bigger weight stay down in the middle wait
Watch Jon get destroyed at HW
Why is it an upset?
How can you say upset win ..??  Jan was supposed to win clearly. Don't hype Israel and this MMA sport too much based on false assumption.
chael wrong for the 23423038509th time
Amanda should be the main event every time she fights.
Why would you say "upset win"?   NOT an upset at all. You would be a fool to think that twig with the giant ego would beat Jan.
Upset to the casuals. I called it and it was evident.
Not an upset Izzy should have stayed in his weight class this might be the beginning of the end for him and I like the kid but he's trying to do to much.
Upset? I think a lot of people out there bet on Jan, I also gave him a high percentage to win
lmao if you thought someone losing while going UP in a weight class was an upset you are not welcome in this sport
I love seeing fighters analyze fights. Chael and Felder are perfect for that role
So Jan was winning every round in standup on strikes and significant strikes by quite a bit VS FASTER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED striker in opinion of many and lost only round 3 but people are talking about his takedowns. He was easily winning even without them.
Imagine if this fight was against 38 y/o DC. Looks like Jan set a new blueprint to fight Izzy. Maybe try to secure an early takedown and once he is wary of it, you can strike with him the next 4 rounds. Much easier said than done though, I bet none of the middleweights can take Izzy down at their current state.
This commentary made Khabib vs Conor look like a fair commentary... Goes from "He's making him tired by allowing him to punch his face", to, "Izzy is out striking Jan" when he wasn't...
feel like if they had a rematch jan would just pressure him and knock him out now he knows his best haha
Even my cat know Izzy loose by jan
"Izzy is picking him apart" - Commentary  *FIGHT STATS HAVE ENTERED THE CHAT ROOM*
Upset? Jan outstruck Izzy and then took him down in the later rounds.  Don't know why the commentators thought faints were gonna earn points? After that Izzy should stop asking for Jones cause Jones will hurt him on the ground.
Blachowicz is real Champion 👏💪
Jan is a monster
Izzy came in lighter 201 pounds. He looked slower (i know due to weight) was taking his time to intimate & was getting gassed out soon. Perfect defense from Jan.
Izzy didn't have a Plan B and not sure if he had a Plan A. Just Sayin' !!
UPSET XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This host did his hw with his interactions. Good Job!
What kind of upset? 😁
upset....?? smh
Chael is an idiot. He told us that Jan would land 0 punches.
Izzy could have played it safe his whole career and punked the middleweights until he was 30-0, but he didn't.   He went up 20 lbs, fought hard, lost, and didn't make a bunch of excuses unlike Sean O'Malley and Maycee Barber. Respect.
It wasn't the plan to wait til the 4th and 5th... he just couldn't get the takedowns earlier. He took them when they came, and they came in the 4th and 5th.
Is Chael deaf in one ear? Why is he always shouting?
Upset?   What?  Everyone acting like Jan is Seth Petruzelli.
The media were for Issy, that's why we see those dumb titles, comments and smear campaign. Not good when media mixes like this with sports. F..n media want to control everything.
Ofc if jan didnt punch, kick and wrestle Adesanya should win
Their was no fear for Jan he kept the pressure on izzy
Not an upset, gang. Just a bad  prediction based on hype and miscalculation.
Issy has waaaaay to manny groupies, that's why even if he was KO'd many would say he won the fight :)
Błachowicz Master !!!
Weight and octagon size gave Jan a clear advantage
How is Blachowicz winning an upset? He's the bigger man not to mention the defending Champion.
how is it an upset XD??
Chuck Norris is looking younger.
It wasnt an upset
Man to much hype on adesanya..looks pretty ordinary. Jones be like u were comparing me with this kid
They still dont say a word thats Jan outstrikes Izzy, only talk about his wrestling and take down
Why is it an upset win
Upset...lol...no.  Jan studies his opponents meticulously. He was never gonna lose
Before fight: Muscles don't win, speed kills! After the fight: Blachowicz was too big... It's pathetic :D
Jan Błachowicz 👏👏👏👏
I say the upset win would have been if Israel won
upset? i'm so happy smug face Adasanya got L.
Not an upset. Except for Dana.
not sure how people thought izzy would beat jan
Jan kinda outstruck Izzy too
Felder is a great commentary
Jan attempted two takedowns in both the second & third rounds & Izzy easily slipped away... you guys sound like Jan could've taken him down anytime he wanted.. don't forget Jan only landed one punch in the entire fight
Did everyone miss the takedown Jan got in round 2? Was i hallucinating?
Jan tried to take Izzy down multiple times and always ended up at the cage where Izzy Izzy as able to defend  What fight have these guys looked at? Jan got beautiful open field takedowns on izzy but tried at least 6 takedowns in round 1-3 which Izzy stuffed
Big surprise! Zangief defeats Dhalsim.
I always fast forward Sonen I can’t stand him 😂
The bad guy ❤
Jan was disarmingly patient n didn’t give Izzy the exchanges he needed to pick apart the bigger guy, Jan kept the takedown in his back pocket till he needed it. A rematch in the future would be interesting, Izzy gonna learn a lot from this
It's delightful seeing Izzy eating his own trash talk. Long live to the old King.
Upset win?? Went exactly like it should.  lol
Too light
Jan's striking is super underrated. It may not look as smooth and fluid and Izzy or some of the more polished strikers, but the fundamentals, footwork, and ring craft are all there. He stood in front of Izzy's outstruck him, landing jabs and kicks. It was really impressed.
Janek Auuuuuuu!!!!
Stop playing people act like this was a total domination .. in the end Jan got tired.. and laid his weight on him ..
What do you mean upset win?
So you're supposed to let the black guy win now?
Lol calling it a upset 😅 you guys are a joke
I expected Izzy to lose & he did 🤷‍♂️
Everybody everywhere is showing Jan no respect here they titled the video it’s a upset and the fans are saying Izzy can’t compete because he’s not good enough like Jan isn’t the champion at LHW talking like he was just some journeyman fighter 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
"Upset"???? Jan is the champ how is it an upset?
The guy actually fighting at his own weight is always the heavy favorite
Jan King thanks !
People still think Jan won only because of size. Hes certainly heavier and much stronger, but he is shorther and has a shorter reach. Yet in the standup gane he managed to beat adesany at his own game, where izzy tried to fight from the outside
Im not Israel fan but the Fight was closer to a draw neither man dominated gave just as good as eachother got :/ no one should have gotten a 10/8 round like. Over all a good clean fight
Jan landed more every round.
There was a time where it looked like Izzy was slightly starting to pick jan apart. Wish Izzy threw more leg kicks and set his high kicks up more. Izzy was trying to finish him rather than try point score and win via points
Calling the champ the underdog is why it went down the way it did.
Coming into this fight there was a lot talk about Polish Power but as Chael says that wasn't what was getting Jan the win. If your not a fan either that cool but this fight was super close watching it Live. Once the take downs in the 4th and 5th happened it was fair to say it's in Jans favour but both put on a great show and massive respect to Jan for doing what he needed to do. When your going for a title as a contender you can't rely on the decision it NEVER go in your favour unless your Bisping.
Upset win smh
So now when Izzy fights at 205 again, do you give him a title shot? I don’t think that’s fair.
Well Izzy is still champ, all the haters can go @#%- themselves. How are we going to be excited that he got beat when he took a risk fighting someone in a different weight class. It's like praising a dad for winning a fight with his teenage son 😏 I'm glad they are all still champs. It was just try and error. This was still not the best of Jan, and like many before him, Izzy has something about him that makes his opponents not fight like they are used to.
"Upset" bro is the light heavyweight champion... in theory it would’ve been an upset if Izzy won
It was close Izzy just couldn’t take 5 rounds with someone that big he could have put him away early when Jan was confused with all the faints but hastened on the openings that would have set up some big hits but didn’t jump on them because he didn’t want that polish break away and break your jaw lol
Know ppl will understand why Izzy has no chance of beating Jones
Chael Sonnen in the lead-up to the fight: "Everyone thinks being the bigger guy is a size advantage. They're all wrong. It's a size DISadvantage." Chael Sonnen after the fight: "Guys, size matters."
How is this an upset win ? ESPN just stick to football clowns
Why is it an upset? Wasn’t that polish dude the champion of the division?
I don't know about the effect of his takedowns, though. In the end, Blachowicz was breathing way heavier than Izzy …
Upset win? Not for the winner or this fan! Dummies
I hate how disrespectful the net work be. Upset?? He was the champion.
Izzy still has a chance to become champ at Light Heavyweight, but I just don’t see Izzy becoming Heavyweight champ. Thosd dudes will smother him.
Size do matter  😅😅😅😅😅 chael is a savage 🤣😂👌
Upset win?? I thought if Adesanya could have won then that would have been an upset win!!! Jan was the champ for crying out loud ... anyways biased commentary
Polish power! Grats to your champion 🇵🇱
Chael is dumb af sometimes Jan literally said “Izzy hits stronger but is slower than he thought”
Wasn't an UPSET win at all
honestly F U Kale, Stop shouting at us lol
Paul knows Blavovovich
Don't like the fight
Came here just for Chael
Lots of people saying about size now. I think 95 % of, fighters were saying Izzy would win so size or not this was magnificent. As for the wrestling, I believe jan was polish champion so his wrestling like all his aspects of MMA is first class
A middleweight lost to a heavyweight and u called an upset win Lolz
Mówiłem że przegra tylko mnie nie rozumieliście
Izzy was the only one that had no respect for the 205. Jans a beast, and would beat jones inside 3 rounds.
Upset win? LOL
I'm only waiting for some fool to say it was "racist, antisemitic attack" ... It's so common to vomit over Polish people at any ocasion in the "modern" west.
LEGENDARY POLISH POWER
What people ignore is that Blachovich also won in the striking when they were standing up despite what the commentators said .  The scoring was in favor of Blachovich.  Without the reach advantage Adesanya was not so dominant in the striking department because he isn't really that fast , they were pretty even matched in speed and length.
upset izzy nuthuggers
I can’t fund a single interview with Paul Felder in it where he doesn’t say “level changes”
Thanks espn 👌👌
Jan's win an upset!!??  it's upset for only ufc official's and casual's 😂😂
upset? we knew who was going to win this.
What's crazy is that Izzy is gonna learn from this and become stronger
It wasn't an upset. Adesanya got FULL MOUNTED AND WITH 30 MORE seconds it would have been a KO.
Commentary was so biased, Jan won 3-2 and shown his experience in the last 2 rounds. Media and Dana need to show more respect to guys like jan
upset for who? my pick was jan...everyone knew when he puts him down izz cant stand it
Why 'upset win'? Jan dominated Izzy, he was reading this fight for all 5 rounds.
Jan beat him standin,ground and checked all his kicks,that's where Izzy beats his opponents,kickin and runnin, he was beat in all areas,to a better man,let's not forget who asked for this fight, Izzy actually called himself the best in the World before the hiding from jan,so he just got what he deserved.and i bet his glory days are over.
It's only an upset to those riding the Izzy hype train. Jan fought an excellent fight against Reyes and has been getting better with every fight in recent years. I had their chances of winning at roughly even going in
Why do people keep saying upset win,like blachowicz had no chance.I'm glad he won well done to the polish power.
Izzy lost this fight because he wasn't feeling it your knew it
Izzy was the underdog. Izzy has been KOd cold before.. Jan is the better overall skilled fighter. Jan's  skillset is enuf to beat Jones. Jones may lose to stipe, ngannou, Jan and izzy... don't be surprised.
Why no one is acknowledging that Izzy said that it wasn't the weight that Jan won with, it was the iron defence and how quick he adapted to Izzy's change of style
Blachowicz went for takedown in first round but noticed that Izzy slipped easily away so he staid patient and waited
No upset you all just riding izzy.
Everyone thought Adesanya to do this and that but polish power .......
Upset??
Upset??? You crazy. This is what happens when people  think they are cartoon caracters.
Felder, for God sakes line up the hair around your upper lip. Looks gross my dude
And Izzy will still be higher that Jan on the p4p rankings.
Lol. Izzy lost before in K-1. This is not the first time that he lost.
i knew izzy gonna lose because he moves slower because his on light heavywieght now
Izzy must retire now...he is done man..🤣🤣
Blachowicz winning in his own division against a guy going up 15 pounds outside his normal weight class is an upset?  What a dumb headline!
How was the lhw champ the underdog against a middleweight 😂😂
Paul looks high lol
all cheal know is talk louder so he can cover his stupid prediction.
Not the first loss in his pro career, only in the ufc
You do nothing.
Upset???
How is it a upset Izzy is way overrated Lizzie the running bender
Paul Felder ruined his career with commentating . he  is the only one to beat Charles Oliveira in the LW
What do you mean 'upset' win? -_- 'jOuRnAliSts'
Anyone who thought adesanya had a chance to win is an EXTREME casual...
Upset?????
Izzy is simply to small
I like Felder
Jon jones gonna kill israel
Called it hes too small for dude
I don’t understand why this is titled an upset win?
Jan uses a coach just for his mindset  and made him believe  he truly  is a champion and  when you truly believe  your mind can do alot
Jan looked so tired.
It was not a upset I said this would happen month ago
Felder has a chuck Norris look about him.
This wasnt an upset, Jan is the better fighter
" Jan Blachowicz ' s upset win  " ??? Never get mma news from Disney
chael is legitimately a savant-level communicator never runs out of great things to say.
Chael woulda beat Izzy lmao
Disrespecting Jan by calling it "UPSET". Its Jan's Divison it is not an upset win.
This helped Jon Jones. Now only thing Dana has left is Jon Jones. He will get his Francis or Stipe vs Jones fight now.
Chael:  Blahohohvovovich
Chael lost a lot of Cred and Fans, he picked Israel with 90% of the P.C. UFC 'Experts' - Shameful modern-day Morons~
Ppl still sleeping on Jan AND STILL !!! I also think Izzy continues to be too hyped up
Can't believe how incredibly biased the commentary team and the UFC itself were against Jan Blachowicz. So happy for Jan Blachowicz that he was able to prove all those who disrespected, underestimated, and counted him out that they're all wrong. Israel Adesanya is always going to remember every single time before he sleeps and when he wakes up that he was outclassed and overpowered by Jan Blachowicz's legendary Polish Power, and was forced to eat some Polish humble pie. Izzy just got lucky that he lost to a humble and classy champ like Jan Blachowicz. Amanda Nunes is most likely going to retire undefeated as a double champ, just can't doubt her incredible greatness. Really funny how Megan Anderson said in the press conference before the fight that she's the first true Featherweight who has real Featherweight power that Amanda Nunes will face, but ended up getting totally outclassed and submitted via armbar. Aljamain Sterling's acting is terrible and we all know that he can't beat the real champ Petr Yan straight up, that's why he just took the easy way out to become a so-called champion.
Jan could beat anybody in the ufc right now. Including Jon Jones.
Chael never uses his inside voice when he does these spots. I think he subscribes to the idea that the louder he talks the more right what he says will seem to the audience.
The ballwashing by the commentators was disgusting
Chael “It’s Blahovavich” Sonnen
For me the Polish Power is overrated, good win but meh. IF he ever faces JJ, he will lose. JJ is on another level
This isn't an upset win
“Adesanya lost because Jan is heavier” “Adesanya lost because judges suddenly can’t score properly” Denial ain’t just a river in Egypt.
White iron fist power wins
Jan did try to take izzy down earlier as well, but izzy got out of it.. Jan should be the winner, but it was a competitive match..to give those last 2 rounds a 10-8 is insane.
Chael "Size is a disadvantage" Sonnen with the 180.
UPSET????? Izzy did nothing to challenge him. Faking strikes won't get you the strap... UFC commentary and ESPN are a joke... Jan was the champ going in and served it up.... Period...
I think ima have to give more props to Jan , he is somehow still a bit underrated. I say he beats Jones
It wasn't an upset win
Where are All (9 out of 10) UFC 'Expert' wildebeest who picked Adesanya??? Ignortant PC Jokes~  🇵🇱👊🏼🤠☝🏼
Chael you change my mans name every time lol
THE KING OF THE NORTH
Before the match Sonnen size doesn’t matter. Guys just says whatever
how to win a fight lay on top and do no damage
Poor Dana, first Connor, now Izzy...all his superstars....
Uncle Chael always calls it a weight DISADVANTAGE
Paul 'The Welder' Felder.  P4P Best scrapper in the UFC
Don’t act like Jan wasn’t winning at least half the time on the feet, more so later too
"size matters" Chael P. Sonnen
Will Chael stop using his "Size disadvantage" line now?
Who expected drama with izzy titty? Hes a scared nimwit...he was getting whooped and didnt have the gusto to go for it...dare to be great, but don't act like you're great...cuz ur not great! GRERAT JOB JAN!
Polish power and polish patience that's what wins u fights 😁
POLISH VIKING 🇵🇱☝️ Respect from POLAND 👊
Izzy was shocked with his power
IVE LITERALLY BEEN LAUGHING ALL DAY AT IZZY FANBOYS WHO THINK IZZY WON THE STANDUP 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡 AND IF YOUR ONE OF THOSE FANBOYS READING THIS COMMENT GO LOOK UP THE STATS ON THE FIGHT
Wasn't uncle saying in his fight prediction that size doesn't matter. That the heavier guy is actually at a disadvantage? Now he seas SIZE MATTERS! LOL gotta love love uncle chael
Why reference the Romero fight when they did zero wrestling and zero of anything in that fight.
Felder needs to run it back to the stache as fast as possible instead of that beard.
I loved it. Izzy was too cocky and needed to be humbled. Dana is always trying to push his favorites to make money and he thought Izzy was that next fighter to do just that. If Jan was given another 10-20 seconds at the end of the 5th round he would have knocked Izzy out because he was pounding his head on the mat. Izzy was already counting multiple belts even talking about going to heavyweight. Ha! Ha! Not as bad as you thought you were but you still got that big mouth!😂😂😂
No GINO No WINO
Why this clown is shouting?
BIGGEST WINNER WAS JONES...
Upset ? lol
Jan deserves more credit 🤷🏽‍♂️
MMA fans are so strange. Someone gradually rises up the ranks and improves, people start slowly saying that the person is one of the best in the world, and then YouTube comment section is full of "oh now you respect him but you were doubting him before?!" Yes, he's proven himself. That's how things work. Should everyone have thought he was dominant champion material when he was on a losing streak?
How's it an upset? Jan is a beast and weight classes matter. Respect to Izzy for taking this risk though
Jan showed he’s a real champion, he played that like a chess master
The thing about the UFC is that they do an incredible job marketing and promoting these fights. They honestly made everyone think the middleweight champion was just going to stroll into the light heavyweight division and beat their champion. They made everybody think that Gaethje was going to beat Khabib because he won one big fight. They made everyone think Conor was going to knockout Dustin when he hasn’t won a fight in the lightweight division since 2016. And Now everyone thinks Ngannou is going to beat Stipe even though he didn’t win a single round in their last fight... This was in no way an upset, UFC fans are just extremely easily blinded by the hype train.
I think Adesanya was afraid of the polish power
Good Fight izzy!
1:23 fart :P -  had to do it sry
Casuals thinking Izzy won the fight lol
Chael stop yelling p
Upset according to who? It was a near even fight in predictions and outcome so i dunno about any upset taking place
Shoulda been dc felder n anik
Was not upset...lol. he wont straight up
Jan was such a big underdog because ufc makes you believe Izzy was untouchable but jan is a just as good as Izzy on the feet and better on the ground
He will be unwanted champion like Stipe Miocic .I hope i am wrong.
When shell predicts a fight I go  Betthe other way I’m a be real big
Like how these guys say one thing about the fight, and then Adesanya and Blahovic say something else entirely.
Why was this an upset win? Jan was the champ right?
Chael said Izzy wouldn’t get hit once lmao
ESPN showing no respect for Jan. Calling his win an upset...
All you jan fans r biased .
Good for sport and bad for business 😜
Let’s not take away from Jan,Dude more than held his own,His every strike in standing was vicious af,He’s a real champ period!!!GREAT JOB CHAMP!!!
I don't think Jan could have wrestled for five rounds
At least we won’t have to hear from Izzy as much now. Jones would destroy him lol
Upset?
Felder is a good comentator and a smart one.
Have to wait for Jones to win HW title to see if gaining weight works.
The spotted kick objectively unite because foundation kinetically detect toward a dysfunctional trumpet. undesirable, workable mailman
Chael has yet to let us down with his failed predictions 😂😂
I wouldn't call it an upset. Blachowicz is the bigger and more powerful guy.
New Zealand’s most loses
I really hate that DC and Joe were riding Izzy, they were saying stuff like “izzy’s picking him apart” and just all around discrediting Jan
Romero the best wrestler in MMA? Lmao Chael is smoking again
Izzy doesn't have the heart to be great.  Only his size gives him dominance over the middle weight division.  Too timid in the kill zone!
49-45 on two cards 49-46 on the other, wow the commentary really had me thinking izzy did better than he actually did
Jan’s the man
Sterling is no champion, he was losing almost the entire time before the knee.
why its called upset win whats up espn?
I understand the hype about Adesanya (20-0, 15- KO/TKO), but I don't understand why there are so many experts expecting Adesanya to beat Jan. Some even said Izzy would beat him with ease. Jan Blachowicz has beaten big names on the way to the title fight. He executed his gameplan against Izzy perfectly, proved again he is the true UFC LHV champ. He's got the skills, the experience, the mental strength and knows how to implement his gameplans agains his opponents.
Idk why everyone thinks it's an upset the worst guy in the light heavyweight division could probably go 5 rounds with the number 5 welterweight
Lol what are they talking about.. it was 4.5 difference so... 2 kg. How that could be a gamechanger? They only speak 'Jan is a big guy, what happens with your lungs when smbdy with his weight lays on you". SUCH A BS. Izzy just lost - happens. Jan was better but they need to make excuses only to hold this fkin hype train at the same level..
Jan - new fan favourite
3:21 chael tapes his AirPods to his ear lol
What upset! It was a man fighting a boy!
Paul Felder is the only guy with common sense in the whole espn.
Upset ??? Wft is wrong with the media
Jan was twitching at everything but it worked!
What we found out is that Adesanya would get beat by Jon Jones and Khamzat Chimaev.
If it wasn’t for them 2 last take downs Izzy wooda WoN,  but congrats to JaN 205 & STILL!
Some of the same people who said that the size difference wouldn't matter are now saying that Blachowicz 🇵🇱 was too big. I think that Adesanya 🇳🇬 just got beaten by a better fighter last night and that's it. I wasn't pulling for either guy, that's just the way I saw it. Jan Blachowicz is the real deal plain and simple.
Izzy is trash on the ground. The excuse is the weight difference but that’s not it. Look at his hips and shrimping. He is lost down there
Cheal shut ur mouth 🤫
Rockhold, Weidman, Jacare, Izzy all failed at moving up.  Jacare was close tho I give him a W
Respect to both
Why are they calling it an upset?
He just humped him for two rounds
Say little and do your job <3
IMO the match was always in jans favour And I thought Izzy did really well for the weight jump  I was hoping it wouldn’t turn to a “wrestling match” if that’s what you want to call it
Am I the only adesanya fan who was worried jan was gonna win via KO ? It seems everyone seems to think izzy was going to win easy. Not one person I actually know had Jan as the underdog  Izzy was the underdog moving up to jans weight IMO  The scores were a little out of wack but still due to the last take down winner still jan
How was this an "Upset"? The only thing upsetting is the biased unprofessional commentary.
Jan attempted takedowns in earlier rounds as well but either Izzy got up quickly or escaped.  He didn't just wait till fourth round and if he could, he would have done it sooner.  He made a different takedown approach in 4th round and succeeded and then the spear in round 5 was perfect. And the finial seconds looked as if there were 30 more seconds that would have been stopped. But the judges scores are insane.
This just shows that Paul Felder shouldve been the commentator last night, just a well analysis and perfectly netural
Chael is like mush in Bronx tale.  If he picks a horse, it will generally lose.
Why is Chael always screaming
been saying for years, izzy is overrated af
sorry but it's not an upset unless you're a casual
All these Jan fans coming out of the woodworks with hindsight being 20/20. If y’all were such big fans, say something before the fight. Respect to Jan and the Polish Power, he had an incredible fight but all these hindsight warriors is wild considering half of y’all didn’t say anything before the fight.
"Upset win"😲??!! Jan Blachowicz was about 20 pounds heavier than Israel Adesanya on fight day. I don't see an upset win here at all.
We have to agree.  Amanda made Anderson see ghost.  She was scared to death
the commentary team was like: oh look how good izzy is defending those fists with his face, and how well he blocks that ground and pound with his head
Chael should think of begining his political career. This guy is good in scrambling people's brains.
I think Paul it was just you and I that had Jan to win .. I knew Jan would take his time .  He exposed Izzy abd now you are the super star.  I think the people around Izzy are feeding him to much bs.   Izzy was made look ordinary
Yoel the best wrestler in MMA lol
Israel sorry won that hands down!!!!!! Israel is the new light heavyweight champ in a lot of people eyes. Israel is the people’s light heavyweight champion of the world!
First and foremost, why is it an upset, because people are riding Adesanyas member or they just dont think I that Jan can do it....live ot when the underdog proves them all wrong and he did....the man started slow. Ut got pretty much comfortable with it and loosened up a little more and more and he was t the least bit intimidated by him....he was cautious of the speed but that's it....When izzy got tagged,and he did not bad but he did.....Adesanya got pissed and you could tell he was after getn tagged....Blahowicz deserves all the same praise all the commentators have Israel....fair us fair a great d right is right....during the fight they were pulling for Izzy like they did for MCNAPPER......then they jumped bandwagon and sing different tunes when momentum changed....Best thing from all this is the Underdog won. Congrats Polish Power Prince!✊🏼🥋🥇
Adesanya is good on is division because is huge for te category, like Conor on 145, but on natural category he dont have chances
Upset? lol come on you filthy casuals
Upset win, boll*cks more like izzy bit off more than he could chew and Jan deserved the win
Upset ? Izzy is the man but this wasnt an upset !
There is a reason why the heavy weight champ is always the baddest dude
Jan Błachowicz had a great range of plans, in the 4th round he could go to mount and cover G&P izzy but he chose a safe half guard for fear of being thrown off the seat.  showed it in the fifth round without risk (end of the fight)
Did chael say Yoel Romero was arguably the best wrestler in mma lol remember what khabib did for wrestling in the ufc.
Chael and his constant Roid Rage yelling. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Chael "I'm still on steroids even though I retired" Sonnen!
I like that ESPN guy. 💪🏻😊😊😊😊😊😊👍🏻
Steven A. Smith: "Aljo is a quitter"
Give Jan credits he deserves.
Dana white and the ufc commentary are disrespectful to jan. Dana said it was not 4-1 it wasnt a dominant performance really disrespectful company
felder is that guy you want to hear after all those fights
Jan the man.
Israel always had a padded record and no real MMA skills he’s so hyped up and only kickboxes . Glad Jan outsmarted him at his own game
I saw it coming. Jan beated Reyes, who almost beat Jon Jones. In the fight with Reyes, Jan was incredible. He is a monster... Vikingos will be the real goats of Ufc... Let's see what Jon Jones will do against Miocic!!
Recap: Izzy probably walks around at 175. Blachowicz was at least 220 if not 230. It’s that easy
After the fight my respect for Jan and Izzy went up. A humble winner and a humble loser
That’s a terrible score reading on me bruh  This was more of a 49-49 49-48 49-48
I always bet against what Chael says. Dude literally is always wrong.
Of course Jan won. Chael the fraud picked Izzy
There's a lot of good fighters in the mma. Zero excitement. No personalities. We need another ronda, conor, chael
Chael knows how to speak Blachowicz’s  name, he just do it wrong on purpose
Also everybody mentioning the Weight advantage for Jan...but not age advantage for izzy. Jan is almost 40...
....Jan said izzy was slower then expected and hit harder them expected...
Was it really an 'upset'?
'Upset' win? It would be an upset win for the challenger to beat the champ, not the other way around.
I wonder if Chael realizes that they can hear him without yelling
Hot take: commentary teams should talk about what is actually happening in the fights
Where's Stephen A Smith on this subject?
Upset? Dude got manhandled
Not an upset win lol Jan is the champ
Size doesn't really matter
Izzy has a chin too
I'm glad that I watched this fight in Polish TV with polish commentators (they were very fair and even cautious in statements), because when I read your comments about how UFC commentators were so  biased I would be pissed.
Host eye  looks like he is going to sleep anytime
Sonnen is so annoying! Get rest dude, don't forget to breathing :)
Upset? What!! it was not an upset loss Izzy was outweighed 40 pounds and that in my opinion made the difference in the aspect of Blachowicz mounting Izzy too much weight to get off BUT if they would have stayed standing Izzy would have won but thats what your suppose to do use your advantage which Jan did congrats but stop it with the using UPSET in the headline to this video smh
How is this an upset? Jan IS THE champion.
It goes both ways And the lighter guy will be much faster so it’s a give and take thing
Someone tell chael to watch the fighter interviews Jan said issy had more power then he expected the opposite of what chael said
Hahahaah  the Chael curse, picked izzy, izzy lost
Disgusting BIAS.
Izzy should have learned the way Jan put it on Dom should've told him something. Then to come in a little light.
Upset lol. Exactly what happened is what anyone with a brain k ew this would happen
After seeing this fight, its clear that Izzy vs Jon Jones would have been like trying to battle Pikachu with a Squirtle. You could do it... but that's definitely not how you become a Pokemon Master 😂💀
Is it Izzy or Fizzy? He fizzled out.
It's exposed Adesanya's weakness ,lets see what happens now in the future  against big middle weights who know now  how to beat him. If this fight had carried on Adesanya would've got beat up.
Israel wasn’t going to win this fight, only fools thought he was going to walk out double champion.
Anderson never complained fighting at 205 vs the way bigger Forrest.
Who coulda thought that the thing that united all of twitter and reddit was that the commentary in this fight was biased and awful LOL
Keep treating Jan like a no-name every fight. You’ll keep being surprised by him.
All due respect to Jan but the media is biased because (imo)  there was so much riding on an Adesanya win. There’s a lot more meat on the bones of the story with Izzy moving up , potentially grabbing a second belt and setting the stage for a Jones matchup. We were all kind of expecting a barn burner matchup also but it was really a pretty measured , technical display that lacked the anticipated fireworks.  Jan retains and we’re kind of like , cool. Now what ? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Great fight.
All the pundits here LOL It likes Andre The Giant vs Hornswoggle, and the media said Andre is the underdog LOL
This isn't like boxing. These weight classes are 20 pound increments. That's why champ/champ is such a rare achievement in the UFC. A good big guy can sometimes beat a great smaller guy. Jan is not a better fighter but he is a bigger fighter. Seems that was enough. I agree, Jones is doing it right, but won't be a big puncher at Heavy. It's hard to carry punching power in boxing even at 7 to 10 pounds. Punching power at 20+ pounds Is impossible unless your name is Rumble Jhonson lol.
Chael is such a snake. The whole lead up to the fight he was on Izzy talking about how he'll have an easy time. Now hes trying to breakdown how  "size matters"
Everyone who doubted Jan 😂😂 Y'all can keep quiet
Next time, Uncle Chael should try not to predict 🤣
I wanna see Nunes va Cejudo 😂
That was not an upset
how is this an upset ???how
Nothing new here, same treatment ufc gives to Stipe.
A congratulations to Jan from the uk
How is it an upset? Izzy was moving up. Check how that went for weidman and rockhold when they went up. This isn't an upset win. The fact Izzy went to decision was an upset loss for jan. Going forward i think jan is going to have trouble defending that belt.
It was an upset when if you thought Izzy was going to win I did not
Dislike for the title
So happy for Jan. He has now cemented his legacy. 👊🇵🇱
Jan looked atleast 210-215 lbs
Izzy is the greatest if he wins, if he loses, his opponent is too big...😂🤣😂 those ufc "experts" are hilarious
Maybe the UFC and the media will finally stop promoting Adesanya as a better fighter than prime Silva and Jones. Both are clearly leagues above him.
1. Sig Strikes  Jan: 107 of 193 Izzy: 78 of 161   2. Sig Str Rate   Jan: 55% Izzy: 48%  3. Total Strikes  Jan: 184 of 276 Izzy: 99 of 182  4. Takedown  Jan: 3 of 5 Izzy: 0 of 0  5. Control Time:  Jan: 7:06 Izzy: 0:01  6. Head strikes   Jan: 67 of 146 Izzy: 32 of 102  7. Body Strikes:  Jan: 29 of 33 Izzy: 17 of 23  8. Leg Kicks  Jan: 11 of 14 Izzy: 29 of 36  9. Clinch:   Jan: 6 of 6 Izzy: 0  10. Ground:  Jan: 16 of 18 Izzy: 1 of 2
Its so funny seeing all these Izzy fans humbled making him out like he can move up and take out the champ. Keep Jones name out your mouth you wil never be on his level. Go back to middleweight where you can fight bums and make yourself feel like a king lol.
I'm done buying these ppvs prelims were way better then main card
JON JONES WOULD STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF IZZY LMAO
After Jan won, the Albuquerque police department was notified and put on standby with binoculars on JJ's house.
Fans : this is a biased Commentary  Teddy Atlas on Manny Pacquiao : Are You Challenging Me?
Jan is a great guy, but this was the worst title fight in history outside of gsp vs shields
I was shocked how many “experts” thought Izzy was going to easily win.
Chael is such a tool analysing fights
Izzy has lost twice in his professional career. First loss he got knocked out.
Felder picked Jan. My respect for this guys as an analyst/commentator just went higher than it already was already. And he was one of those guys who said Jan was not just power, but he has his own style of technical striking. Just a different type than Izzy's technical striking.
Jan Destroyed reyes that really beat Jones at 205....but somehow izzy team thought he was ready for JAN?
Lets be honest, Jan is not dropping down to fight Izzy and would not stand 5 rounds with Izzy, the takedowns saved him.
This adesanya owed me 70$ since romero
This was no upset!!
The only upset is the lost $$$ between Jones and Izzy.
But Chael, weren't you just saying in a video that the biggest nightmare is the guy that's weight class below you? Always a little faster, always able to go a little longer 😂
Where is Chael "its a size disadvantage" Sonnen??
Upset win? Are you for real?
Jan is a monster
Am I dreaming? I swear Izzy won that fight.
Its not an upset they forgot jan is a muay thai black belt
ESPN is going to lose their minds: they have been propping up Israel (for obvious reasons) and haven’t even mentioned Jan...at all. Hah woke is going to start blaming something.
It’s not an “upset” win if you were betting on Jan B.
i hope Izzy is humble now lol
Izzy didn’t get the Victory but he got RESPECT plus he kept the SAME Energy in Defeat as he does in Victory “Aya Bi Ekun” 24/7, Thank You Brother for the CONSISTENCY, Lion Mode, Always, 👍🏾👊🏾✌🏾🇳🇬🇺🇸
Congrats to the Victor, The Champ, his Family and Team, 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱👍🏾👊🏾✌🏾🇳🇬🇺🇸
He should've fought atleast once at LHW.. packing on weight before the fight should be illegal..
What is up with everybody brings up Jans size? He made weight, period. He didn’t calll Izzy out, Izzy wanted to do so.Clean win, fair and square, please stop making excuses. Izzy lot, that is the bottom line
Jan won 4 rounds.
Jon Jones would have ended Adesanya
Why  do  fights fans.  think issy would have won.   He has no ground game and will never have.   He ok against fighters. who can’t take him down.
The only reason Jan is disrespected is because he's WHITE and proud to be Polish.
Why is this an “upset” ?? People are lame.
Chael needs to stop shouting every time he speaks.
to say it was a upset is disrespectful to Jan who is a champion in his division and Izzy is a slim guy moving up to challenge him.. size matters
Izzy didn't defend the takedowns well because he was too worried with the power punches and had to concentrate on defending those, then before he knew it here comes the takedowns.
Man they should of stood them up it wasnt enough work by jan being done in my opinion
chael betted on israel, so I betted on Jan woooooooooh
His takedowns were the key. It was smart on Jan's part. Take the striker out of the game n win. Props to both. They both had class at the post press. Mad respect
IA fans before the fight: "Muscles don't win fights" After: "Jan was just too big"
Come on get over it anime has no power in real fight
I thought izzy was not ready to move up and last night showed. His body is not ready for the heavier weight, should of weighted a couple more yearz.
Only an upset for the rookies and bookies.
btw... couple more seconds at the end of 5th...
Israel wasn't slow at all... that spinning back kick in the 5th looked very quick to me... he was just outclassed,  can we all accept that the better fighter won... thanks, go Jan
Upset win. How is this an upset. Idc who you are if you’re moving weight, you’re in a new division. Props to Adesanya for the fight but Jan is different gravy.
Who Else Heard the Fart At 1:23😀
Complete difference when they stood in octagon giant vs skinny
For me Adesanya won round 1 and 3 and Jan Won round 2,4 and 5. Ground game matters that's why it's mix martial arts.
The Jones vs Adesanya mega fight needs to hurry up and happen!!!
He titled it upset like blackowitz wasnt a champ
Who cares what Chael ever says ask a champion 🙄
Upset???? It was more of a mismatch.  The Polish Power is bigger, stronger, heavier, better than the last Stylebender.  Jan is a mini Stipe.  Same thing will happen if Jon Jones will meet the heavyweight champ in the Octagon.
Upset win? Lol no. Went exactly as expected. Israel had a chance for sure and fought well but Jan is better. Respect for him moving up and challenging himself though. Even more so for being humble about losing. Gotta respect that.
why is it an upset?
Jan was never the underdog stop calling it an upset. Hype train halted
Jan is heavier than Adesanya, from the begining i smell it, he will lose in anyway
Man first thing chael says "Size matters!" haha
How is this an upset? Jan is the champion and the bigger guy. He should be the favorite.
Jan The Man
What are you talking right now ???  JANEK WIN END OF STORY   IZZY ACCEPTED FIGHT WITH HIM
It’s not anything to be ashamed of.We still don’t know if Jon would beat Jan tbh it’s one thing too assume, it’s another thing for it too actually happen. So really I come away saying he tried his hand against Jan, Now you try yours.
Why's the caption UPSET WIN!!!??? Jan won the fight fair and square. He dominated adesanya with ease. Show some respect to jan
F you all experts you all was underestimating Jan, now you try to sa Izzy was smaller? Izzy has all advantages hight, reach, speed, stamina, and only 5pounds lighter
Jon Jones will get dropped in HW
Unlucky champ. If u don't try u will never know. Gotta give him props for letting his ego go
Upset? I'm happy for Jan... and the thought of izzy in the HEAVYweight division is a joke
chael didnt watch the fight
Makes me proud to be Polish 😜🇵🇱
Even though I despise Jones, he's going to wreck Izzy if they were to fight imo.
Paul Felder's top lip never moves...very strange concept.
Jones was right he would have torn his arm off.
I don't see how this is an upset win...
44yr old Yoel was the best wrestler in all of martial arts 🤔
There's no way that is felder laughing again 😂😂 like if you also watched the prediction video
Khamzat Chimaev is Coming. You Can't run this time izzy.
And Israel thought he can go to heavy weight ? Imagine the way stipe would’ve controlled him on the ground ?
Izzy would have made it if he could have avoided that dirty bluff trick of being exhausted in the end to trap Jan. He actually got trapped in his own web. Otherwise both great fighters of all time and one of best UFC match so far.
Sorry, but this was only an "upset" to casual fans and people who make dramatic titles for articles.
Size Doesn't Matter. Eg. Daniel Cormier, Triple-C, Conor McGregor.
upset win?
I am a fan of Israel Adesanya, but I am glad Jan Blachowicz won. Jan Blachowicz is a very big, strong guy, even amongst other fighters that compete regularly in the light heavyweight division. Izzy has no delusions about the weight class he belongs in. But, he is always willing to take risks, and makes no excuses or apologies for his decisions. Izzy took a chance and it didn’t work out. That’s why weight classes are part of the fight game. Size does matter! Congratulations to Jan Blachowicz on defending his title against an undefeated champion. I don’t think that Jan Blachowicz is going to let anyone take that belt away from him easily. I’m excited to see who he fights next.
Izzy been mouthing off about Jon Jones. He's clearly not ready for that weight class jump.
Jones would literally kill Adesanya
Upset win?
Yeah don’t think you’ll fair too well when you slam pizza to make weight
Its a pretty well recognized element. Take two champions..the bigger one usually wins...not always, but usually. For Jan, a great moment. For Israel, the mystique of, "can he be beaten?"..its gone now...just like when Buster Douglas beat Mike...people knew it could happen now.
blah, blah, blah..Blacho won and it wasn't close enough for the judges to protect the fan fav.
Izzy can go back to fighting midgets at 185. He really "dominates" fighters he has a height and reach advantage over. If he really wants to test himself he must fight people of roughly his height and reach because it really isn't hard to beat people you tower over.
Why was this an “upset” exactly? Jan was champion defending HIS belt. Y’all are so biased against Jan. He deserves better than low bigoted expectations like that. Smh. And if your argument is you’re just going off of the betting odds, it still is sad he doesn’t get credit where it’s due.
Not the first loss in Izzy’s professional career. Mma career maybe, but not his whole professional career.
Jan fought to his strengths which was take Izzy down Jan was the much bigger stronger fighter AND JAN FOUGHT SMART if it was going to stay standing Izzy would have won Jan didn't let that happen GOOD FIGHT BY THE POLISH CHAMPION
Jan had more significant strikes in every round.
Adesanya is a GREAT fighter BUT there are weight classes for a reason. Izzy just learned that the hard way
Upset win? Really? Maybe I'm missing something. Respect to both fighters.
Not the nate s win over conor was upset nor is this jan s win over israel I dont understand the ufc analysts We fan are better than u
I’m confused how this is an “upset” Jan is a beast
Jon loves Jan cause Jan did alll his dirty work for him
Style bender dominated him standing up. His wrestling got exposed just like Connor.
And people thought Izzy can beat the likes of Jon Jones :D :D
Who did it upset? Lol
Well I'm an Izzy fan still am but congratulations to Jan He Won Fair & Square well deserved win ...Izzy will be better for the win he will be back I reckon
Where is the upset 🤷🏻‍♂️
Chael, you have a microphone. Stop screaming.
Get Joe and DC out of the COMMENTARY.
I knew Jan would win, when Brendan Schaub picked Izzy
Chale dont get many fight prediction right  jus saying
Jan said he wanted to go for takedowns from round one but just couldn't get them, so they decided to wait a bit until Adesanya looses at least some of his speed. Jan had a great gameplan and skills to execute it.
Imagine calling it an upset.
That's what happens when you believe your own hype 😂 👊👊 reality check!
I swear if Jon loses in heavyweight...
Can’t believe they made such a big mistake! Putting Chael’s record as 30-16-1 when everyone knows he’s undefeated
Why "upset" ?
Puzzy, don't chat big again. Real fans knew you couldnt wrestle. Puzzy fans are scum manchildren casuals.
Where does Izzy come from they pulled up Nigeria flag, I thought the last time it was Australia flag
If the last round had been 10 seconds longer, Adesanya would have gone to another dimension 💤 💤 Jan made him look stupid, out striking him in his own game... gratulacje Janek, to zaszczyt mieć takiego mistrza ❤️🇵🇱
Now let's see an even fight btn Issy vs Reyes....
Izzy took a fight with the Light Heavy Weight Champ and he lost. So now some of y'all be acting like Izzy was almost beaten to death and should just quit mma, lol. Don't be pretending Izzy hasn't run through some killers in his natural weight class. It was a good fight and Jan fought well. Also, ya can't win 'em all.
Chael's hype train derailed
Please deliver us from Stephen A's voice Please please please!
I bet for the first time ever on  3 underdogs for  a parlay and hit!
Jon Jones is not happier, he as he said is much wiser as fighter.  Two things: Izzy needs to work on his ground game: and Izzy needs to work on a weakness in his defense.  As I look at the punch that knocked him out in his kickboxing match, Jan seemed to have picked up on Izzy gets careless in exchanges at time  and can be "popped" with that right hand.  It set up the eventual point winning take downs and pound strategy.
Chael is the kid who would just keep talking to win argument
jans defence is crazy . parry jab !!
Poland 🇵🇱 🇵🇱 is proud Janis fantastic fighter congrats Jan. Janek gratulacje mistrzu jesteś wielki !
Who gives a fk what Felder thinks lol
Jan's strikes defence was the key
I think weight advantage is far from a complete reasoning as to why Jan won. I mean, if 15 pounds was THAT big of a deal, Giant Silva, Bob Sapp, Hong Man Choi and the Sumo guy from UFC 1 would all be decorated champions.  To be fair, I don't think that guys that big have the stamina, flexibility or physical integrity to train for extremely long periods of time like everyone else. It's much more of a factor when both guys are on a relatively even skill level. And I think that's what was proven tonight, that Jan's actual talent for fighting is on the level with guys like Izzy.   Jan's got pretty unlucky with some loses in the past and also, like many top levrl fighters in the past, he likely allowed his mind to impact performances. One can have talent to match the GOATs and just have less consistency in their mental game.  The best thing we can hope for is that some of those unsung talents will continue to learn past the age when most fighters begin to think they know it all, that some early mental slips would instill humblness to match their talent. Jan seems to have done that, which I consider to be as earned as a championship belt can be.
Israel has won my respect for sure. I'm a fan. He did not have to move up but to prove he is a true soldier and warrior he did so. This fight proves why I have never ever considered Khabib a great champion. He should be fighting in this weight class or Wonderboys weight class, but no he will only fight midgets. GSP said  Khabib is bigger then him and walks around over 190 lbs. I just don't understand why everyone drinks the Khabib Kool-Aid. Going from 190 to 155 to fight midgets is insane. Khabib is a endomorph body type and Connor an ectomorph and he should have never stepped up to fight this imposter. Until Khabib steps up like Israel and the other 4 double champions he is a coward. When he rag doll guys in his weight division then I will say he is great. Period end of story. Give Connor his due like Israel for stepping up to accept the challenge and risk everything. Thanks Israel for a wonderful performance.
Upset win?
Next eastern european miocic will destroy ngannou... just to dominant ...
Uncle chael is humbled
Izzy landed some good kicks but Jan 100% outstriked him in boxing. Put some respect on his name. Beautiful performance.
Paul Felder is a class act and did not buy into the UFC’s hype of Adesanya “running through” Blachowicz. Great critical thinking by Paul.
One thing i think izzy is good ...but it remains me of connor having much more risk... izzy is taller than jan ...light heavy might be his division cause now everybody he fighting middle is much shorter than him wich makes the fight booring cause if there is any risk on izzzys part he can just low kick from outside till the opposition have to rush .. so basically jan size of guys are more of his own size than yoel romero for example
Izzy reinvented the wheel. Like dude weight classes exist for a reason.
Perfect summary by Felder.
Polish power!!!! Since he lost to santos I KNEW HE'D BE BACK!!
Why Chael is yelling like that as if he was arguing with someone here 😂
I respect the way Israel took his loss.
Where all the Izzy nuthuggers at now?! Stay salty.
This is the by-product of having Jon Jones as champion of LHW for so long. Every contender coming up, arrives with a higher level striking. Jon Jones takes part of this victory
Wow no you are experts?
A 10-8 round was nonsense
And many of the egomaniacs who frequent this platform are going to come out and say they saw Jan beating Stylebender. I'm gonna lift up my hand and say I did not see that coming. I under-rated Jan's stand up game. Congratulations to the man for pulling off a great win.
that b boy need to eat more african food
One thing we learn from this fight ladies, Izzy will never beat Jones at any given time. There's a blueprint to beat Izzy but no blueprint to beat Jones. True that 👊
It isn't upset. Don't sleep on Jan.
Adesanya thinks his a big boy
You can bet the middleweights are going to be testing Adesanya with takedowns.
Jan really had all the tools to beat Izzy and most people couldn't see it
Joe "adesnya was landing more" Roganovich
Is it just me or was Chael's makeup kind of distracting?
Jan won every round.
Not exactly an upset win we new he’d win
Izzy was giving up at least 30 lbs last night mad gotta go in smarter next time he moves up weight classes and gain weight
This was not an upset
Adesanya was surprisingly flat footed and gassed out.
'romero arguably the best wrestler in mma' that's super delusional statement.. romera has the most overrated wrestling in mma and that's a fact .
So many casuals, izzy was out of his element. This is a weight division of titans, he is just a boy, his time will come. Someday, but not today lol... respect the champ.. foh
Polish Power won with the speed🥳🍾
So happy no more talk talk of izzy cringe .... Chael thought this guy could beat prime silva and jon 😂😂
To go the distance with the polish power is amazing effort in itself. Good on izzy for trying..back to middle weight to reign n defend 👍
Polish Power won with the speed🥳🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🥇🥇💪💪💪
I compare this to the Jon Jones vs Gustafson fight. Izzy had a guy with reach. Just as long as his.
This isn’t gonna be a popular opinion but I think Jan would beat Jon.
"romel the best wrestler around" are we going to just forget about kihabib.......
Why did Chael have his AirPod taped to his ear and it still fell off 😂
Jan should’ve been the favorite, it’s disrespectful he wasn’t, he’s the champ and  Izzy was taking a risk going up in weight, but as an Izzy fan, much love and respect to Jan, a true champion with a well deserved win🙏🏾💯
Knew Jan had him
Well done Jan. To be fair, this could have gone to Izzy or a draw as well. Good rematch!
Can you imagine Jon Jones fighting Izzy now 😂
Why push Adesanya to lightweight! He can’t carry this sport!
Big suprise to nobody who doesn't immediately buy into the UFC hype machine!
I don’t wanna hear it Chael... you disappointed a bunch of wrestlers. It was the night of the VIKINGS!!! WRONG BET ~ LIONHEART JCVD 4 life
Adasenya ❤❤❤❤ still love you mah boi❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
chael “size disadvantage” sonnen now chael “size matters” sonnen, or maybe chael “change my tune whenever convenient” sonnen
Clearly these guys weren’t watching the post conference
Retrospectively speaking it was pretty standard how it played out.
2:43 PAUSE!!
i want the whole review
I'm a big Izzy fan but I was telling everyone I know he bit more than he can chew. Adesanya is a natural middleweight and had no business going up. If anything he should've gon down to welterweight, but he respects Usman too much
Izzy was gonna win with striking bit jan was smart and iz had no ground defence . he will learn
When I made the preview for this one I said “people sleep on Jan’s BJJ. They see his power and forget he’s a black belt. Well.....
Izzy showed class in defeat and did not complain about the decision. That says it all
It's only a upset to casuals
It's only upset for the casuals at ESPN who only know Conor, Izzy and Jorge. Jan is an excellent Champ. He beat Izzy pretty decisively.
It’s not entertaining because Jan was just in for grabbing legs 🦵
I had Jan to win.
polish are warriors. their favorite past time is street brawling each weekend at nightclubs and discos that one polish man told me... (before corona)
Costa: Adesanya were you drunk too??? 😂😂😂😂
"Upset" give me a break.
@danawhite, if you say the judges got it wrong then why not run it back for izzy vs yan??
Uncle Chael always awake and ready to talk.
I’m happy for blachowicz but no way he won 4 rounds he won 3 forsure
Jan is just on a different level THAN IZZY.
Can't believe how silent the Izzy fans are now lol. Back to watching Naruto I guess
jan jestes zajebisty kolejny lewel zdobyu wielkie gratulacje dal ciebie teamu i rodziny
nothing upsetting about polish power 🇵🇱 💪
Zero ground game.. jones would kill him in one round
I never tough that polish boy defending his bell absolutely amazing my respect and adesayna was a warrior amazing defender championship
I don’t wanna sound racist but I don’t understand why there’s always so much animosity between high level black fighters. I enjoy a little bit of trash talk here and there, but it seems like they always genuinely dislike each other.
Jan won.
Adesanya is and always was overrated
izzy took the lost better than his fans. respect to both laying it all in out.
Put some respect in Jan's name!
BLAHOOVAHWICZ
It was too easy for Jan, I feared this might happen the moment Izzy said he wasn't going to get bigger. If you don't want LHW size, stay in your fvcking division. I wonder what he was expecting, Jan would have smashed him to pieces if he'd grappled earlier. Lol
Jan blwchowicz win for the reason ! The reason inside the secret lock.
Haha Jan is better striker now
Well there's no doubt who would've won if he fought Jon Jones
All of Blachowicz take downs were clean and caught izzy on the face right away. The pounding right after the take down was precise  no excuses Jan Blachowicz dominated tonight like it or night he sure was the best fighter.
The takedowns saved Jan🤷🏿‍♂️
why was this fight 3 rounds? afaik title matches are 5 rounds
Commentary so biased
I dont find it sn upset at all. Jan always had it for me. Dont let people get in your head
Saying the champions win was an upset lmaooo
Give Jan and his team credit. Not only did Jan beat Izzy, WCA beat CKB. The sport is becoming more scientific, yes the fighter still matters most but the tactics and the strategy just as much. Amazing to see.
Is Chael EVER right?? 😂
Can we stop comparing Izzy to Anderson Silva in his prime now? Cuz he's nowhere near Anderson's level, never will be.
Win or lose Izzy still my guy !   he’s still a Champ now it’s time to defend it Nd one day he will be a light heavyweight CHAMP  trust
Upset win? Lmao made me bunch of easy money. Only casuals bet on adesanya in this fight.
i give the first 2 rounds to Izzy,but Jan won the fight anyway,but the MMA fans are worse than Hooligans seeing the comment sessions about this fight,some Nazi clowns mixing things up
Wasn’t a upset they both good fighters
People who don’t acknowledge how bad the scoring was is just put right crazy. One judge having sterling winning should speak volumes. I had Jan winning 49-48.
All casual adesanya fanboy were gonna dissapear 😂
Izzy lacked the power to make Yan respect him. Also did way more damage when he landed. Finished him off on the ground and Izzy couldn't do anything about it
Some of the comments say Jan doesnt have respect he deserve and thats true This is all about publicity and hype and sales and popularity and so on and on and on Adesanya is spectacular fighter, very pleasing to watch and perhaps Jan's style looks boring compare them two But the winner is only one, Jan Blachowicz and thats the fact. He is clever fighter, very inteligent and powerful and of course he deserve his credit for it Well done Jan U proved people wrong again and made polish people proud of themself Dziekujemy Jan
Dana and commentators have to cry now....
upset???????????? how???????
Jon Jones: I KNEW I should've pushed for an easy money fight with Adesanya...now Jan got money from my easy work.
How was it an upset? He is the champ of his division and is much bigger than Izzy
These judges are not good! Izzy definitely won a round if not two, yes they got the decision right overall which is a plus but their scores are far from what actually happened. Izzy won 2 rounds I thought personally but Jan did win the fight overall I thought...Crazy scoring tho.
Chael guaranteeing izzy to win is like chuck barkley guaranteeing any basketball team to win.
Wouldn't exactly call it an upset
While what next we know the show for JJ and Izzy showdown is Dead so do you have Jan vs Jones.
Don't know if it was really an upset.
jan actually said izzy was slower but more powerful than what hed expected
Homeboy Izzy said he was gonna beat Stipe! No disrespect to Jan, who put in his work, but imagine what Stipe would’ve done with that g’n’p and most likely the feet. Izzy take your Coming to America dancing back to Zaminda my dude....and lol Francis thinking Izzy won. Wonder why that would be?
2021 is crazy so far man Holloway having his best performance ever Conor gets TKO’d by Dustin Kamaru finishes Gilbert Another Derrick Lewis KO Aljo wins belt by DQ Adesanya receives his first mma loss ....  and we’re only in March
as soon as I saw Izzy rolling with Andre and then Andre got slapped, I knew Izzy was losing....Shut up Chael.
IZZY CANT BEAT JON JONES
Dont know about a upset. Predicted he would win long time ago.
Błachowicz baby!!!
Chael "Size matters" Sonner
Izrael 'The Legendary Polish Power" Adesanya
Upset win?...... lol ESPN ...
Izzy new he lost the fight. Enough said...
All these new bandwagon Jan fanboys now lmfao
Izzy clearly wasn't him self.. Lack of sleep. This fight must of been on his mind. Or just to wired up.
JON STEROID JONES THE CHEAT 😂😂🤡🤡 He happy Izzy Lost 😂😂😂
Chael 'size disadvantage' Sonnen
The Romero fight was 25 minutes of nothing
Legendary Polish Power 🇵🇱🔥🔥🔥
Nothing to do with size, he outclassed him. Out striked a striker 🤣 commentary was absolutely terrible. One sided all the way through when Izzy didn’t win a single round
Izzy don’t like getting taken down style bender.
all this experts :-) all against Jan yesterday :-) hahahahah. love this.
Only novices are calling this an upset. I'm actually surprised that Izzy did as well as he did. It's a completely different beast when you go up in weight to fight a bigger guy, even when a champion goes up to face an average fighter the result is usually in favor of the bigger guy, much less move up to face a champion!
Size ! Plain and simple
Straight dominated.
Style bender got robbed
Izzy has no power at LHW.
Nooooo Izzy lost gg tho Jan did a good job
Humility is strength. And that's what Blachowicz has. Great guy!👏🏾
I don’t think Izzy won any rounds
It's not an UPSET win if the underdog LOSES.
see how fast people jump off the bandwagon
Chael "Izzy isn't going to get hit once" Sonnen.
Congrats to Jan on a well-executed fight plan. Some think that Jan should've taken Izzy to the ground sooner I disagree, it was the wrestling that drained Jan's tank, and had he gone to it sooner he could've been out of position to control the last two rounds. As far as Izzy not having the power, I believe Izzy does have the power to knock Jan out but he wasn't able to create the right opportunity. Izzy blasted Jan a couple times causing Jan to back away. Great fight by Jan he should be proud of his showing for this event!
SLAVIC POWER 🇵🇱🇭🇷 BLACHOWICZ and MIOČIĆ
Izzy backed up jan quite a bit, but had trouble landing what he wanted, I think jan wanted to prove a point that he’s pretty slick himself and doesn’t just rely on his power
Izzzzzzzie, muhahahahahahaha, the bubble was popped.
jon jones easily beat israel adesanya
Takedowns aside... it was a very close fight.
I'm not watching mma anymore 😢😢😢
Izzy lost a close fight to a man who weighted 20lbs more than him on fight night. No shame in that.   He's still a future goat.
Out of 8 weight categories, 5 have slavic champions (if you count khabib in). 3 more to go, cmon bratany 😅
POLISH POWER !!!!!!!  And Izzy's fans as expected are looking for excuses LOL Before fight they said it will be easy fight for Izzy and...dream is over. Izzy defeated for !st time and it will affect his mind. Thank you Jan ! Show respect to the Champion and winner idiots on video.
I hope izzy even improves more after this
Funny how  Adesanya got beat by a guy named Jan.
So sad 😢
How was it an upset? Izzy fangirls are real silent lol
Dammit Chael, you're the best
49-45 though🤔
Upset win???? Nihgga please
izzy looked slow an lazy
Omg the "weight" bs is already such an overused excuse and it's hasn't even been 24hrs
All these announcers including Joe Rogaine😂🤣 Smh.. Were all biased.. PUt SOME RESPECT ON JAN B.. NAME SON!!!
Yall must've forgot.......that off cycle izzy cant wrestle
Jan should take izzys belt
I wanted Izzy to win but he scored two fouls and that fight showed that ground is his weakness. Jan is a beast and well deserved win. That fight was still good no running all action
Izzy lost, I agree, but no way 49-45... Izzy won the stand up
Chael "size matters" sonnen
USADA needs to investigate the commentary team cos they were tripping 😂. Great fight by Jan, awesome gameplan. Respect to both fighters 👏.
Expecting more action. Didn't like it when there smothered for three minutes straight.
Jon jones is gonna steal that hangman rope if he fights jan
Yawn Jan is still boring AF. NEXT
what UPSET??.. Lmao.. 🤦‍♂️😅🤦‍♂️
Commentary kept Izzy in the fight. Izzy won the 3rd round, and that’s it. Joe and DC during the second or third round said that Izzy was out striking Jan, the production team pulls the numbers and what do you know, Jans out striking Izzy. Feints don’t win fights, fighting wins fights and Jan fought beautifully
Upset ? Anyone with good knowledge of the sport and their Mom knows that a guy who is overrated and don’t know how to fight on the ground soon or later will lose. It’s basic schematics... jezzz
Want uncle chael on commentary
To slow .... lol  Blachowicz champion
Jan didn't do nothing really, congrats to him for the fight IQ
Izzy was to skiny
Jan brought izzy to school tonight.
Izzy looked human and proved how much of goat he actually isn’t
BLM
VADIM NEMKOV #1 light heavyweight
Cheal what you say now?
And Izzy wants to fight Jon Jones? He'd get smashed
it was chael, he cursed adesanya
Wait so dude came in 15lbs heavier?  And that's legal how?  Total BS if you ask me. I would protest with the commission get NC and get a rematch.
Izzy was over hyped
Blahowicz is no joke, first Dominic and now adesanya crazy
Upset win?? 😂 go away
Jan is a hero :)
Jan used his technique and skill not size,dont underestimate his skills.
This is heartbreaking 💔 😢  Izzy vs jones is off for another 3 years now 😳
Keep it up bro come join the Beasty Gang
1:24 Did one of them just fart? Haha
Jan’s technical striking and counters were underrated. He was even with Izzy in striking and unfortunately no one saw that coming.
Not really an upset. Sometimes you need to stay in your lane.
Not an upset you were all just disrespecting Jan
"upset win"?! Talk about bias, man....🤦
Happy for Jan. Izzy has great takedown defence when he's against the cage but in the centre of the octagon? Oof that area got exposed in final two rounds. Jan also did well checking the leg kicks. Well played. Honestly thought Izzy would dominate the standup. Credit to Izzy's chin though, took some clean shots.
Man I talked so much trash about how Izzy would win😬
The commentary on this fight by Joe and Cormier was sooo one sided i felt embarrassed for them. Jan was blocking the majority of Izzys shots and then landing little shots. 49-45 by one judge was pretty accurate i think   3-2 Jan the last 2 being 10-8 rounds
Upset win???? Oooh casual upset hahaha. I had Jan all the way.
Good to see broken Native now has a Broken Ego ☺️
Skinny clown EXPOSED
5-0 all rounds goes to Jan, biased commentators.
Jan is better then Adesanya end of story
AND STILL💪💪💪
im still a izzy fan congratulations to the real jan fans not this  toxic haters that  all they do is bandwagoners
i’ve lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... or ratings in not sure which. i won't be silent . just saw it live sry.
Upset? POLISH POWER !
Romero wouldve been champ if he did this to Israel
commentary was doing everything they could to convince everyone that izzy had it jan was catching izzy consistently and all they could say was “jan is breathing so heavy”
Has zero ground game. Conor v.2.0 Lost on his back.
LEGENDARY POLISH POWER!!!
Chael curse continues, even brendan schuab picked him,izzy was doomed before fight
He got exposed 😂
I keep betting against chael’s picks and always win lmao
All the fights were brilliant apart from 2 and they were not the fault of Jan or Amanda
Gotta risk it to get the biscuit. Respect to Izzy for putting it on the line. Jan just to good!
AND STILL BABBBBYYYY!!!!
Lol fight was 4 - 1 to Jan and commentators were still acting like izzy had a chance to win. Man so much bias nowadays
Should be just Uncle Chael and Felder ... no need for the 3rd guy.
Blachowicz was very patient in this fight.  While not flashy or dominant, he had a great strategy and took those last two rounds with grappling/wrestling expertise.
POLISH POWER
Its r3ally hard to listen to Chael after hia predictions go wrong except for khabib.
I knew Izzy wouldn’t win. I mean weighing in at 200.5? Giving up 35-40 pounds to Jan? Weight matters. Grappling with a significantly bigger Fighter is just an uphill battle
Like i said jan looks huge and that was the case, congrats to izzy he took the risk and gave 100%. Congrats polish power 💪💪
I guarantee Izzy wins the rematch without a doubt. With ease at that! Watch🤣🤣🤣🤣‼️
Some guys still praising adesanya and discrediting jan as if Izzy won by ko
CO KRECISZ TYM LBEM KASZTANIE JANEK THE BEST !!!!
I switched to my regional language commentary cz I couldn't handle Joe's commentary
After this fight I can see Johnny bone could smoke Izzy in 1st n 2rd round ........
Ça reste un grand champion car il a pris le risque d'aller combattre une catégorie au dessus et n'a pas perdu comme une merde.  Ceci dit, il s'est pris beaucoup de jab dans la gueule. Jan a compris son point faible lors de l'avant dernier round et a pris l'avantage physique sur lui. Izzy devra désormais plus travailler son sol car ces prochains adversaires de sa catégorie savent maintenant comment le fatigué.
All you "marty fake snoozmen" nerds better have that same energy for Jan. He literally dry humped him 4th & 5th round. No attempts to submit Izzy
Middleweight hype train
Hey Chael.....Slap yourself!!!
A lot of people underestimated Jan eat them crowd baby he won me a lot of money tonight 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣
Izzy haters in the comments are like people whose only claim to fame is hating on a successful person.  The saddest group of people on the planet. Oh no....Izzy only has one world championship belt....he sucks. I am better, I can make youtube comments and talk about gyno. What a bunch of morons lol. Do you idiots realise what type of life Izzy goes back to after a win or loss, and y'all just sit around on keyboards obsessing over people's nipples.
Sorry dana can't make another conor McGregor money🤑💸💵💴💶
All Sunday grandpa watchers of MMA saying it was close or Izzy win maybe just learn to count to 200 and compare significant strikes and takedowns. It's not that difficult you know? 10yo child can do that. Oh wait unless you're blindly biased like commentators
Fair play to both men, jan was simply too big and strong and had a good gameplan.
These two sum up fights so well
49-45 though? STFU
It’s funny, Jan said he looking to put his weight on Izzy , I don’t get why Izzy allowed him to take him down. The dude gave out his game plan
JON IS SAD CAUSE IZZY WOULD HAVE BEEN EZ 😏
Polish power baby
Jan landed one body kick where I thought he was gonna keep doing it, it was the same kick combo he was landing against Reyes. But Jan played it smart.
Chael please do good picking next time . I am just an ordinary MMA fan also was so confident that Jan will win this . Come chael I expected more from you
"Jan's getting outstriked, Jan's getting outstriked" literally seconds later the stats show up that Jan was effectively outstriking Izzy. Commentating was horrible and biased
Felder the man... He was right with his prediction
Izzy the best no doubt. Well done to Jan
I’m glad this isn’t boxing. White people are still allowed to win fights. If this was a boxing match every round on every card would be for Izzy. UFC is still a legit sport.
Chael said he needed steroids for hypogonadism to people with a straight face. He will continue to make great statements for the rest of his life.
I was quite surprised by a lot of things in this fight. Adesanya moved up a weight class but he was still the taller as well as the longer opponent and whilst he was able to control the range he didn't do much with it, certainly not to the same extent as his previous 2 fights. His leg kicks were very inefficient (for his own standards), Jan checked most of them and blocked/dodged all of the head kicks. Adesanya despite having this height/reach advantage as well as being the supposedly faster fighter was getting caught quite a lot (albeit more at the end of Jan's punches, he did well to roll with them), especially with Jan's jab. The rounds that Adesanya won were extremely close because of this. He has taken a very defensive approach to his last few fights and tonight at times it worked against him, because despite the fact that he wasn't getting hit a huge amount, he was landing probably even less, it was mostly the few leg kicks that actually landed that may have given him the edge in these rounds. The commentary made it seem like Adesanya was dominating round 1 and it was actually extremely close. An interesting point would be that I think the hardest shot landed in the entire fight was a punch landed by Adesanya. At the minute I cannot see how Adesanya would have any chance at beating Jones. I know there was a big weight difference in the fight but to say that this was an automatic disadvantage is a pure lie, because Adesanya chose to fight at this weight, he felt it would give him the edge. We didn't see the elite level striking that we were expecting from him, both defensively and offensively and I think that was mostly it. We knew going into this that his wrestling and grappling wouldn't be that great especially up against a bigger guy, so that automatically gave Jan 2 rounds - but the other 3 rounds were fully striking. Given that Jan wasn't able to land very much, and also given that Adesanya had the speed advantage, he'll be disappointed to not have done a better job picking him apart from the outside. He did so well with his feints, but in the end they set up nothing. He simply did not perform to the standard that we expected and that we were promised. Happens all the time, he's got time to improve and to come back stronger.
No that Biggs lost to Perreira twice before and that ooh god was knocked out in the second fight by Perreira who TD w power
Upset win 😂😂The only fighter who did well from CKB - Kara France and even he had to show A LOT of heart to win. The UFC needs to start promoting different gyms - not just CKB and TMT Thailand ... CKB got beat up.
Izzy is way overrated, Jon Jones would run through him
Jans stand up is really impressive, he outstruck izzy in every round
This was an upset‼️
I blame izzys coaches for misdirection. They good greedy for the gold. Izzy ground game was not solid enough to fight such a bigger guy. He definitely needed to get his ground game challenged at lower stakes with someone who's good at wrestling but not world champ level wrestling
Izzy vs gustafsson would be a good fight I'd  he stays at LHW
Upset win?
upset win??? say what!!!!!
This no upset ..its expected ..Jan is very good fighter and he is maturaly bigger and made right adjustment in last 2 rounds to win
I'll still never understand how the champ wins and it's an upset...
I love how they try to EXPLAIN after completely disrespecting the WINNER. Jan was treated the same way when he fought for the belt. Everyone expected him to lose to Reyes. Sad
As usual, Chael's wrong in his pick.
Izzy can’t do want Conor did 🤣  That would of really hurt his ego. He can remove the comb now and stay humble.  People slept on Jan  So glad Izzy lost 👏
Those calf kicks are more deadly than having your head caved in, in the commentators eyes. Isabel got schooled
There goes the Izzy and JJ fight. Never going to happen. Now maybe both will shut up.
It was like a Bear hunting a Deer. Jan was huge! 😨Makes you wonder why even weigh in at 205 to blow up over night.
making excuses with the size now LMAO. remember when it wasn't supposed to matter for someone like Izzy? remember when most of the "experts" said Izzy would make it look easy? Jan DESTROYED Izzy at his own striking game. He destroyed him in the standup and the takedowns were just icing on the cake. these SHILLS just want to keep the Izzy HYPE going because they have more money invested in him.  Respect to Izzy, he's a great fighter but Jan out struck Izzy with the most significant strikes.
The only person that this was an upset to was Israel I mean Jan is a beast in his division an upset is when the smaller guy beats the bigger one coming up to that weight. With that being said I’m sure that Hines fight is even further postponed🤣 props to Adesanyas for stepping up to the plate. Side note to the UFC just let these guys transition intoThe class by fighting rank 6 or 7
Another crown jewel in uncle chael's prediction career.
But izzy fanbois were saying he will beat stipe😂😂😂
Polish laying power.
Before the fight bla bla after the fight bla bla...
So glad Jan won. I been buying izzy ppv just to see him lose. It finally paid off im so thankful. He's a talented fighter but needed to be humbled. This will make or break him.
No upset just better all around fighter won in main event...Izzy asked for this fight against Jan because he thought he was invincible...
Atleast he lost to jan and not jones jones will beat izzy senseless that fight will never happen after this loss
Sorry weeb, title denied.
Chael "Size Matters" Sonnen
*Jan snaps Izzy’s head with a Jab* JR: Jan looks tired and he is biting on all the feints.  *Jan lands on Izzy’s Chin* Commentors: ......The problem is Jan is getting outstruck. *Izzy Lands punches on Jan* *DC, JR, JA* Wooooaaaaah!!
Not an upset stupids
....I didnt sleep well last night, that was golden.LOL>
he got the logan paul curse
Khabib's good luck wish to Jan was so wholesome to watch, Jan is humble Champion want him to achieve more success.
I put money on Jan earlier this week based almost entirely on the Gastelum fight. If Gastelum can do that to Israel I figured he'd have no chance against a way bigger Jan. Was nervous watching all the fighters pick em videos where everyone picked Israel though.
Just saw Chael live on ESPN... I think he needs new airpods lol . Messing with them every 5 seconds lol even has tape  on one of them lol
1st round to read your fighter. Smart fight by Jan
It's all about marketing. They still focus on Adesanya, even though he lost.
Izzy clipped Jan a few times...but Jan was smart to do those takedowns.
N izzy thinks he's beating jon. Lol
Why Chael always misses predictions
upsy ... what happened chael ? :)))
Israel has always been overrated, fighting underweight against smaller opponents!
Izzy was to arrogant Nd thought it be easy fight.  Jan shut his arrogant trap downEASILY
Jones would destroy izzy easy 😆!!
I told u guys ,  just bet opposite of uncle chaels predictions .....u will make a ton of money..... hahahahahahahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i don't think it was close, as the commentary assumes. jan was winning the stand up exchanges. and the takedown and control on the. 4th and 5th round seals the victory
Commentary was way too biased
I like izzy more now took the loss great
How was this an upset it, that's mocking Jan, this was a Middleweight fighting a LHW
It wasn't an upset win and Adesanya's stock doesn't go down.    Respect to Izzy for moving up.  Respect to Jan for proving that he's a champion.   Jon Jones should shut his mouth because he lost his last 2 fights.
izzy was getting to cringey anyway, this should humble him
They were both tagging each other on the feet. Commentators made it look like Jan was getting slaughtered in striking when the sig strike counter showed something different.
Israel had the guts but didn’t get the glory I’m sure he is going to be double champ👊
How was this an upset?
I didn’t hear the bias at all I thought Izzy did enough as well could have went either way in my eyes!
4-1 easily by Jan.
Jan: goes 2 for 4 on takedowns  Chael: he went 2 for 2. 100% Undefeated undisputed
Jan smashed him
Why he didn't pick Izzy to win
Yoel arguably the best wrestler in mma? Lmao chael I love you but what’re you smokin? He definitely has the credentials but he doesn’t ever utilize it.. aka why the Izzy fight was a snooze fest
Wrestling is superior 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱 legendary polish power 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
Lmao what? No we don't know if JJ got it right..  he hasn't fought yet
Size difference was nowhere near Loma Lopez
Polish Power
Somebody take Jon’s car keys, It’s about to be a wild night.
Stupid casuals really think izzy can beat Jon Jones lol, jones would end him in 2 rounds
Felder with a great breakdown
Every time Jan landed on Izzy commentators were saying nothing for the first 3 rds so bias I think they all had their money on Izzy Joe,D.C and John lol
Upset win? I would've bet Jan all day long. It is so funny Izzy actually thought he could go to heavy weight or beat JJ .....
10 to 15 pounds?! And the rest bro
before the fight, every single tweet was about how amazing adesanya is (which he is) but after the fight everyone was tweeting about how underrated jan is smh
Respect that man. Held his own in the standup vs an elite striker, and he wrestled him. Maybe some guys are just much better than people give them credit for being, due to the fact that they don't have much of a hype train. Everyone knows that Izzy is good..this doesn't diminish him in any way to me. Winning titles among multiple weight classes isn't supposed to be easy.
If that had been jon Jones..... oooooh boy 🤔🤕😱🤣🤣🤣
I had Jan winning round 2, 4, 5 but no rounds as 10-8. It is understandable though. I thought Jan was the pretty clear winner. Close fight nonetheless. Didn’t expect Jan to out strike and out technique Izzy lol
U lot clowning izzy but he didnt get knocked out by jan didnt even get rocked
The score cards needs to be shown during the fights, it was a close fight though... Thought Adesanya was gonna win, but Jan started later on...
Upset? What upset? I had money on Jan to win.
"izzy took the risk"..... A popular script for izzy fanbois
For all those saying izzy won first 3 round.. Please watch it without commentary... It was close but no way izzy won all 3..
Almost 40 year old beats young prime israel...
Awesome Jan great win,I'm a izzy guy but jan was 2much today!!
Guys can we all stop to think about the look on Dana’s face when he realised how much money he just lost
Who else thought the commentary was biased
Jones would dominate Adesayna after seeing that performance
He got to eat some humble pie maybe I know it's cutting of a farfetch but maybe izzy might respect one of his opponents now and where's everybody at who was talking trash about Jan you know the three to one underdog.
LEGENDARY POLISH POWER
Took a risk and didn’t work. Respect To Jan, and respect to Izzy to take on a new challenge. So many champs would have stayed and played conservative.
Last Bender bent to his limits.
Commentary was crazy tonight. Jan’s game-plan was spot on!
I'm I'm big DC fan but he let me down with the biased 😶😑🤨 SMDH
Now it's time for him to fight Marvin vettori!
The commentry team seemed baised in favour of Isreal. Respect for Isreal to fight a much heavier guy, even dominant champions like Khabib and Usman dont dare to move up and Izzy did that and fought great. And Jan is the true champ. Congrats 👏🏻👏🏻
Khabib gave Jan his smesh power before the fight!
Chael said Jan's not touching IZZY once in 25 min. LOL
Jan's PP (polish power) was too much for izzy.
Paulo “No Wine 🍷 “ Costa vs. Israel “Full night’s rest” Adensanya
Israel should have eat the pizza rather than use the box as a prop
This just made me a bigger fan of Izzy honestly, and it’s impossible to not be happy for Jan man
People clowning Izzy like he’s not the 185 King🤣
It sort of exposed Izzy's holes... zero ground game really. It's fine to ignore that and be an elite striker, but you need to be that much better at avoiding takedowns. Usually he does. Honestly it looked somewhat easy for Jan. I'm actually excited at how underrated Jan is because he's a rare combination of intelligent technique, raw power, and solid (if not elite) ground game.
Imagine if Jon Jones took Izzy down he would kill him on the ground🤣☠️
Lol what a joke Adesanya won the fight. Adesanya did the most action like strekking and kicking. Stupid judges always fucks everything
Ever since the Gastelum fight.. I always felt like Izzy is a scared fighter similar to Mayweather in boxing.. he tries to hit you and then he runs away.. and that is SMART and works usually, but someone just needed to not be afraid and attack him like Jan did
All yall Jan fans now???
Uncle Chael said it guys: Size matters
Funny to see everyone shitting on Izzy after the fact lmao, MMA fans are crazy. Can’t we be happy for Jan without trashing another person?
Funny how after Jan wins Chael starts pronouncing his name right
Commentary was a joke, Jan won every round of that fight! LEGENDARY POLISH POWER! 👊
Razor close fight until the two takedowns
Izzy gotta go back down to fighting guys he has a way longer reach than.
jan fight perfect game
Is jan can beat him like that, then Jones will pick him apart with his movement, and when he feels threatened, he will shoot for the fences and finish Izzy on the ground. I think rakic, texiera and jones can beat him easily. Now with leg kicks, stiff jab and mix of wrestling, lets see if Whittaker can beat him, my money will be on Whittaker this time. IZZY is an exceptional fighter, most of the striking he has works because he has reach advantage of 10-15 inches against his opponents. With the right strategy, Whittaker has chance of beating him but not in any universe, by standing in front of him he is too slick for that.
Y'all saying upset win as if Jan was some unranked fighter. He was the champ lol
Can’t Believe Colby got it right😆
izzy was also defending take downs vs pure wrestlers.  in those fights ( brunson,wilksonon)  he pretty much did nothing keep distance and stuff takedowns until they gassed and got finished.
Izzy fangirls thanking God Izzy ducked Jones last year 🙌lmao 🤣
Kiss Izzy vs Jones goodbye. Jones would kill Izzy. And Jones is a piece of trash
Real winner is Jon Jones 😂😂😂
He thought it was an anime 🤣
Peter yan mvp
I think Izzy had Jan hurt and tired coming out of the 3rd which made him shoot and press the wrestling more.   In a straight kickboxing match Izzy would’ve tired Jan out and got the finish, but Jan was smart and mixed it up like a true MM artist and got a win over who I consider to be the best striker in the company.
The biased commentary this fight was almost worse than Dominick Cruz commentating khabib vs Conor
Izzy won the first 3 rounds imo. Should have won the fight
Jan put on the perfect game plan. He waited, he was collected and focused on not to run in Izzy's hands.
Izzy Fanboys crying 20-1
Is Nunez really a woman¿
So glad this happened humble this guy
They got one thing wrong though, Jan was more tired in 5th round than Izzy. At this point it was 2:2, and Jan started 5th round more tired than Izzy. Anyone that watched the fight, has a brain, would agree.
That’s why you Chaen you deserved to get schooled by Jones.
Izzy looked slow tonight and not his usual self. Was definitely not his night
Congrats Jan and adesanya keep your head up you are champ
Jan was well prepared but propos to Adesanya for the risk he took
Joe Biden Loves your little kids.
Romeo must be thiking if i would have wrestle him the result could have been defferent . by the way izzy got exposed. isn't he?
Bro DC and this undefeated guy Izzy will be the one to beat Jon. Crying now 😂😂
Upset?Even israel manager said ,blachowicz  is bigger and stronger ,than adesanya.
Izzy is the GOAT. He fought a guy 30 pounds heavier than him and took him 5 rounds. The heavier guy had to wrestle to win this fight.
Was it an upset though?
My man dominated his 'the big I m' fighter. Isreal found it so difficult to accept having being dominated. No one is invincible, let isreal admit that. Polish guy demands respect as a fighter and as a humble guy  as well.
Has Chael literally gotten his prediction wrong everytime ? 🤣
Jan won all 5 rounds fact, more significant strikes and harder strikes and grappling control, from commentators to retard twitters just stupid and weak.
How was the fight? Jan: It was Izzy.
anyone else turning the volume down when uncle Chael starts talking ?
where does kevin lee fit into this
I’m happy Jan won but still wanted to see Izzy get knocked out stiff like his teammate on the prelims.
Connor khabib 2, izzy vs jon and illegal streamers. Dana can’t catch a break. 😂
THE VIKING WINS
How is it an upset? he decisioned a 50 year old anderson silva, the stylebender nickname barely applies to him
The commentary was absolutely ridiculous. I had Jan winning comfortably and DC keeps yapping like Izzy is lighting him up
“Upset win” 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
This fake guy  Chaen Sol stated all week that Izzy (The Skinny Clown) wouldn’t get touched, tonight we fans have destroyed your reckless prediction.
Nothing upsetting about this. He's the bigger fighter and the best in the world.
Lol, people are calling this a robbery?
Who would’ve known that a guy that killed himself made Jan become a beast.
Izzy got humbled, polish power is not underdog anymore !!!
Adesanya is too small for LWH, CASE CLOSED!  Nothing more to talk about , I already know Izzy wouldn’t be able to deal with Jan’s size and stature.
Aljo needs to work on his game plan as well as on his acting.
Scorecards were kinda BS imo but Jan still got that W
"Upset win" Izzy was UFC's golden boy and got dominated.
The whole fight week and event felt weird idk, anyone else feel the same way?
Adesanyas roids not as strong as what jones uses and jon knows it now
What a stunner I couldn't even make a prediction yesterday
Izzy couldn’t sleep the night before.
How close was the main event? Was it like 3-2 or??
So we all agree Jon Jones would murder Izzy
Jan won 4 rounds to 1 and people acting like Pinky did so great. 🙄  Jan Blachowicz did what Yoel should've done. Pinky is overrated.
Adesanya ducked Jon Jones by waiting for him to drop his belt before moving up. So the L to Jan looks even worse cuz Izzy tried to cherrypick. He could never beat Jon Jones if he can't get up vs Blachowicz. 😂
I want Stipe to Beat Jones. Just for the jokes. He needs to lose. He lost to Reyes
but i thought uncle chael said size didnt matter?????
Its crazy how ppl were counting out Jan in dis fight. If Jan cn tke him down and smash him jus imagine wat Jones wil do to him, will break his face literally and put stamp of his knuckles on izzy's face.. Stop living in a fckn PlayStation world..
Paul "Company man" Feldors acting skills are on par with this card
Respect to Izzy - he is great figher and  risk a lot in this division. Jan is not joke! I told this everyone to put money on him. Greets from Poland
Izzys stock just dropped lower than his GYNO nipple
I hope this ends all of those stupid discussions about izzy vs Jon. Izzy doesn’t do well with people who has enough reach to cover his distance. Jon is 1000% a better wrestler than Jan, Jon would humiliate izzy.
The level of underestimation Jan received, is just irrational and unjustified.
Now Adesanya is going to be underrated. fight fans are always so near sighted 🤦🏼‍♀️
Izzy can't get bigger than man he need to stay at his normal weight
What was the judging seriously? Izzy was winning the first 3 rounds maybe the second could go either way izzy was a bit wreckless I felt, Jan should’ve body kicked a few more times and be less reactive, he fought good didn’t rush in happy for him, I guess we know what would happen if Izzy fought Jones
POLISH POWER POLISH POWER!!
Jones would kill that tooth pick
Jan won the fight but the score cards are crazy
LOL and everyone was already calling Izzy one of the greatest of all time 😂
Chael’s stats need to change. former middleweight champion and light heavyweight champion. Never even lost a round.
I blame you Chael 😡...you should have picked Yan😂😂
I can’t believe the disrespect people are giving jan
All the tweets during the fight bandwagoned Izzy so hard. So Happy for Jan
Next time Im watching the fights on Mute. Most biased disrespectful commentary all night. Clearly trying to put over Sterling, izzy, etc. Joe and DC were giving Izzy that Glizzy double twist gag style.
Champ wins and it's a upset 😂
Izzy loss because Chael picked him to win
Congrats to jan but middleweights don't act like izzy ain't gonna still pimp y'all second light heavyweights don't breathe yet wouldn't surprise me is izzy comes back
People out here acting like izzy wasnt winning until the takedowns lmao
omg Jan is my HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   GOOD JOB BROTHER!!!!!!
I am filled with joy at the thought of Izzy having a loss on his record.
Great win by jan i should have bet could have won good money. Jans extra weight and wrestling was perfect he stood with izzy for 2 rounds and tricked him into thinking he was gonna strike suprised him with wrestling landed more strikes and won the fight. Credit to izzy he did land some good shots at times, but his crazy head movement puts his head behind his legs making him off balance making the takedowns for jan easier. Well played to the polish power greated display of mma. Interesting to see what izzy does next.
Oh, NOW Izzy's trash. He handled like a champ and he took the risks, I respect him even more for that bro
HAHAHHAA IZZY FAN BOYS ARE CRYING WHILE EATING PIZZA HUT LMAOOOOOO
MUSCLES DON T WIN FIGHTS, BUT MUSCLES + WRESTLING DOES
This year is not going so good for Dana plans, first conor now izzy. Who's next?
Chael gonna cry in the car talkin bout Izzy will beat Jon.🤣🤣🤣
It's weird that everyone is mad at Aljo. It's clearly Yan's fault he doesn't know the rules. What champ lmao
Jan won, but not 4-1. Grats on retaining the LHW strap, Jan.         Also, Bones Jones would wreck Izzy on the ground.
Adesanya would probably take more L’s if he stays at light heavyweight, but he can cement himself as the greatest middleweight of all time with undefeated championship runs. Then come back to light heavyweight to face Jones later
How was it an upset put some f***ing respect on Jan blachowicz  name he delt with adesanya like a boss well done champ 🏆👏
And the casuals thought Izzy could compete with Jon Jones.
When you’re the best fighter in the world today, they don’t call you a great fighter. They call you Chael Sonnen.
I had it 3-2 for Jan. I think the grappling was the key to victory for Jan just smothered him and Izzy couldnt get up but even in the stand up Jan didnt look terrible
DC really shows his bias to guys he likes. He was talking like Jan was being destroyed then Anik reads off he is landing more.
Everyone was already calling Israel the GOAT, yet he just got dominated by a 40 yr old man 😭😭
That was just 30% of what Jon Jones is capable of doing to Izzy
Izzy fought a good fight. Proudly Naija!
Yan f*cked up, Nunes should just pick her checks up at the office next time and Jan & Izzy was trying to out do Santo & Rakic for the patty cake fight of the night.
Well done POLAND!!👍🤝🤝🤝🤝🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻 APSVEICU
Well, uncle chael was on point of course 🤣🤣🤣🤣, (in another universe of course )
I told y’all
Every time a champ went up to challenge the heavier champ he won....apart from 2 people, BJ Penn and Izzy. Blachowiz was an underdog in almost every of his last 10 fights put some respect on his name
So Chael a weight disadvantage is actually sometimes actually a disadvantage
all that fake "adesanya is chasing Jon Jones" hype is *DED AF* 😂🤣😂
Chael was wrong again!!! Twice
Most biased commentary on this fight lol JANS A BEAST!!!!!!!
Chael looking handsome as ever as always
LEGENDARY POLISH POWER
A lot of champions play it safe these days. Izzy atleast tried to move up and go for the 2nd belt immediately with 20 lbs discrepancy. Everyone other than haters respects that. Respect to Jan, class act.
As soon as uncle chael said Izzy, I knew Izzy wasn’t gonna win😂
I'm surprised that the judges didn't protect the cash cow. This is why MMA is better than Boxing.
POLISH POWER
Round 2 was definitely the closest round. Great fight, respect to both fighters!
Chael curse back at it
It wasn't a upset people just underestimated Jans skills.
Is it just me or was the commentary absolutely horrendous in the first 3 ? They were completely biased towards Izzy
If Izzy took his time and put on some decent size... MAYBE he would have a chance to get up off the ground. But respect to both men. We learned that any jones talk is pure fantasy
Fight was boring it wasn’t a physical lost ..... so the win doesn’t matters
Put some respect on Jan’s name
Izzy should leave lhw alone, stay ruling in mid weight. Izzy has no answer for LHW wrestling.   Now that is exposed Jones or anyone would take Izzy down out the gate and ground and pound his life away.  Its a wrap for izzy in LHW, stay killing the mid weight division though Izzy 💪
Watch the Izzy haters come out of hiding and start clowning him
I knew Izzy lost when Chael picked him to win.
Horrible judges mannnnn
49-45??? *These judges must have done a “Paulo Costa” and got drunk before the fight*
Israel "big muscles mean nothing" Adesanya
i think it ridiculous do call jan victory an upset
Upset??
Adesanya won the first 3 rounds, I have NO clue how they even thought Jan won 4 rounds!?
Main card had soooo much potential and it was borderline a let down for me. Santos/Rakic sucked. Megan didn't wanna fight Amanda, Yans DQ & the main event was solid just not amazing.
Jan won rounds 2,4,5 Izzy won 1,3 great fight imo, only casuals say Izzy was robbed.
Crazy what happens when you don’t have an insane height and reach advantage over all your opponents. 😂😂 Izzy will go back down and pick on guys smaller than him again don’t worry
They robbed Adesanya!
The commentating was attrcious for this fight. Jan clearly landed more significant strikes in the first 2 rounds, and the commentators are talking about how Izzy is "definitely outstriking him"
Jan is the best LHW and deserving champ. Also Izzy deserves all the respect, no one can beat him in his division so he decides to go up to challenge his limits. True warrior
WHAT A GREAT PERFORMANCE!!!! THE POLISH POWER WON THE LAST STYLE BLENDER. RESPECT
Didn't really seem like an upset imo. Maybe to Dana and the media
Jan was just to big. People are gonna clown Izzy but he took a risk. Put some respect on Jan's name. He is a beast.
Chael was wrong again.
Lol everybody was rooting for Jan now huh?
The judges must be crazy
Jon Jones is happier than Jan right now.
Stop making everything about izzy you plebs respect the Polish Power
И бу бокх бид
ITS TIME TO BLACHOWICZ VS JON JONES.. MAKE IT HAPPEN DANA!!!!
I knew it 😂😂 so good to see. SIZE MATTERS!!
