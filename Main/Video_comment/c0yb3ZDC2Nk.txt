It's so bizarre to me that people grope drag queens. Keep your hands to yourself.
Time to watch everything again ❤❤❤❤
I don't mind bitchy polite people but I don't f with rude people
Trixie…you’re from the Midwest like I am (Indiana) you’re not important like you think.
Katya that boot is freakin amazing like wow
A drag queen screaming in Sanskrit is too biblical
Women imitating the patriarchy and honking the stinking padded titties of drag queens is the whole damn vibe of some places… lol… it is what it is
What movie are they talking about with the cat??
ohh wheres katyas wig from here? its amazing!!
5:30 I've never had someone grab at my Taco Tina, but I have had my kilt flipped up by enthusiastic pants-police.
someone know the trick’s @? 2:59 😂
The wig at 4:59 is giving Jaymes Mansfield.  Anyone else see it?
The worst is when you don't want to be trauma dumping but like someone asks you a random question that just like requires describing the whole thing in order for the answer to make sense so there's no way out of that it's like well I can't if I say something that's like I don't know how to answer that they're going to interpret that as like they've breached some like really sensitive topic when in reality and a lot of people are fine talking about like the incident itself it's just like the question they asked can't be answered in a short way and you know you have to go into details that like people just do not want to hear but then people think it's like they've done something really bad and it's like you can't you can't fix that like it's just a broken social situation that everyone just has to flee from which is obviously not good
Trixie looks like Acacia Forgot in this vid
Lov Kayta hair 😍
What movie are they referring to????
“How’re you doing” 💀
Perfect Outfit Katya. All colours are geared to each other.
I had a “moment” where I had to have a “visitor” leave and he didn’t want to go. So I said, “I have a housewarming in a few minutes and I don’t know how to explain you.” Luckily it was a studio apartment and he left within seconds.
Watching this in 2025 and noticing Trixie doesn’t mention Vanderpump every week anymore….
Collab
If anyone’s got Pete’s alt please hmu 😭
I am so here for the fact that neither of these hotties can look towards the camera because they are too busy looking at themselves it's amazing!! 😂😂
"I'm gonna snatch your face off like that lady." is insanely vague for the context.
NO HOTGIRL SPOTLIGHT and do the swapout 💯🤺
These btches are wild. Give them any topic and they’ll end up talking about whatever the fck they want anyway 😂
This entire episode needs to be about how abrasive Trixie is and how she interrupts and shouts over Katya
Omg I need to remember they are not women 😂😂😂😂. I love them ❤
Omgg is that story trixie brought up about wanting someone to leave about Bob since they talked about something similar on the podcast 😭😭😭
Something about Katya in a nude lip 😍
i just watched season 7 and I found the grey-haired queen depicting polio rude af and ableist and yes I have a physical; disability  and walk with the same crutches she thought were just fun props i get artistic license but using disability when you don't have one is in poor taste at best i love u btw
Trauma dumping on a regular basis is rude.
Who's Wendy Williams?
0:31 that’s legitimately a perfect impression of one of my neighbours and i’m crying cause she looks exactly like that too 😭
i find katyas pop culture knowledge fascinating. she didnt know about mean girls, but knows Wendy Williams. 😭
"Get Out" is a good movie.
SHE COULD’VE SAID HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SARAH!
what movie was that cat thing about?
Straight girls constantly grope each other's boobs, too, especially when they're young and drunk. Don't take it too personally.
Any idea what movie they were talking about? “It’s the cat!” Girl WHAT is the cat??
It’d be funny if it was a Rocky Horror Picture Show dealie do n Trixie got mad at ppl talking. lol Uno Reverse Card on the rude.
Trans folks n drag queens share many rude experiences w strangers. lol
*2:26** "BUT WE HAVE TO GO. WEGOTTAGO!"* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the ONLY exception for talking in a theater was seeing twilight and when edward asked bella ''what do you hear?'' a little kid in the audience said ''an owl!'' 🥺
My go to line, "well, sorry but I'm kicking you out" when I want someone to leave lol
I was sitting at a traffic stop and all of the car horns in this video made me jump so bad 😂
Me and my friend had to make a safe word because we kept accidently Truama dumping 😭
I've seen this probably 10 times and I only just noticed all of their trades are old men.
5:26 lmao the boob grab!!!
You'll get your lips back when you've earned them
Imagine getting it on with the guy from Clown
That puppy looks great in the wig
8:46… aged like fine 💩
9:10 whats the movie
Trixies beaubooies have grown
I literally can't decide who looks better 😍😍😍
I’ve found that drag queens are also quite gropey. They’re not exclusively the victims of copping a feel. They’re often the ones doing it.
1:29 Got some serotonin from Mrs Mattel playing with Miss Zamolodchikova’s hair ngl pppffffffffff
Katya looks like Carrie Bradshaw and I can’t unsee it😭
Anyone know what movie they were talking about at 8:54
lmaooooo it was britney!!! 3:01
Oh my god the things I want to do to people who talk during movie theaters would put me in prison 8:43
What movie? What does "its the cat" mean? Someone please help
tracy the real chimp is named travis, the fictional one from the jordan peele fillum is named gordy. i hope this helps.
saying "im a ticking time bomb" isn't rude, it's a friendly warning imo. I'll say things like "you're in danger" in a calm voice with a smile when someone or something is dangerously close to me running out of patience.
Straight girls did that to me when i started wearing a binder as a nonbinary person - NO boundaries
Not me thinking I’m rude and knowing I’m ugly lmao
So, like two minutes after Trixie talks about Cate Blanchett pinching a loaf in her house, an ad came up with Cate Blanchett talking about the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). I was gagged.
" you get your face back at the end of the movie. " 😂😂
Damn! Katya makes me a lesbian!😅
Lmao. I'm in Canada and cannabis is now legal. The old lady who lives next to me calls the building manager probably once a month to complain that I'm smoking 🤣😭 Hes like I KNOW SHES ALLOWED TO 🤣🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤦🏾‍♀️🤣  (Its also literally in my lease I'm allowed, and hes told her that too)  Its been a hilarious fight 😂🤣🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😭😭 Maam take it up with the government,  sorry times have changed 😂
I wore a see thru shirt to my WORK Christmas party and got felt up by every straight woman there 🤣😭🤣😭  They were like  "OMG TITTIES! Don't worry I'm not gay!"  Yes but ma'am, I'm gay and youre rubbing my body 😭🤣😭🤣
The amount of shit I've seen people do at the movie theatre?? Someone, a grown someone, once held a full video call in the theatre, While their kid was having a full-blown meltdown in the seat next to them. I went to another film where a bunch of kids were vaping in the middle of the theatre. Absolute madness
This is really not making sense but its so entertaining.. I want Wow presents to let Katya and Trixie film more of these until they have IV bags with them and in diaper already because it is so fun
i love this like fluorescently white blond wig on trixie
no but what lipstick is that
I just know Trixie was freaked going into this one, this was Katya's moment to EXPOSE
I so deeply relate to Trixie wanting to be nice but having brutal bluntness that she doesnt realize can come off sharp bc she just has places to be
2:14 7:43 10:11
The movie monkey is hilarious!
its ok for me to talk in a movie theater cuz im a lesbian
I REALLY WANNA KNOW IF YOU TOLD OFF THAT NEIGHBOR AS YOU WERE MOVING!!??? HOW DID IT GO?
9:08
I haven’t been here in a really long time but I had a really difficult weekend (rude). and yeah this is gonna help 🎉
"I never told you to shut up."  "You did while I was screaming in Sanskrit."
I genuinely need to know what movie they're talking about with the cat. Please.
If speaking at a threatre is rude, imagine offering a smoke to a pregnant woman after groping…
I know it's been 9 months but dors anybody know what the movie is? With the cats I wanna know
"Shame hur"!
Pete is the ABSOLUTE TWIN of French Striker Oliver Giroud!!!
I need trixie and katya to collab and do literally anything together on trixie's channel 🥺
I need Trixie's wig.
I can’t focus they look too stunning I’m gonna need y’all to turn it down a notch if you want me to listen to a word coming out of your perfect mouths 😂😢
9:05 what movie r they talking about??
Trauma dumping at work is so rude 3:56
Ont trixie and katya looking literally like pee and poo with these outifts 💀
THE MOVIE THEATRE PUNISHMENT LMAO
"That actually sounds fun" I cant lolllll
I would love to own katya’s lip color! Anyone know what it is or a dupe?!
Trixie’s idea about talking in movies and embarrassing people by the cast and crew is such a genius idea if you think about it
HOW YOU DOIN? ,,,,-.-,,,,
Pretty privilege
My neighbor is psycho.  She’s wicked loud at all hours of the night.  Her brother tried to break in my unit through my bedroom window I was laying in bed when it happened and he goes “oh I thought this was my sisters house” the cops have been at her condo 6 times this year that I’ve seen.  She threatened to kick my ass one time in front of cops.  Every time I walk by her she makes comments about me and my body.  She called the cops on me for sitting on my door step one night, listening to a YouTube video on low, claiming a noise complaint.  Literally she needs to be in a psych ward.  She chain smoked cigs in her unit (which isn’t allowed) I only care bc I can smell it through the walls when I lay in bed.  Thinking about getting a no harassment order on her.  Bitch is unhinged.  Fucking Donna
5:32-5:36 Another reminder of how  misogynistic and homophobic the "Crocodile Dundee" movies were.
currently watching you high and it is the only thing keeping me calm
Okay now that Trixie has moved out of her old apartment we need to know if she actually talked to that neighbor.
Katya is so hot god
WHAT WAS THE MOVIE THEY REDACTED?!? I NEED TO KNOWWWW
Anyone know what lip color Katya is wearing??
“Cutting people off is rude” Poor Katya 😂
8:58 what film was she talking about?
Katya is looking soooo beautiful tonight
Katya looks so hot 🔥🔥
They're dressed up as their favorite things to talk about, piss and shit ❤
did trixie just predict the new black mirror episode 🤣💀💀6:35
So sad no one has said what the movie is yet lmao
“ I look like f✨ckin Fergie. “ 😂
I wonder what movie they were watching with "It's the cat".
I love the whole hot people get excuses to be rude like no sweetie if ur rude unprovoked then that makes u ugly stay nice and pretty
Whats the cat?! Lol I want to know what movie there're talking about 💯💯
Katya is so gorgeous it's hard to look at her
i need to know what fucking movie they were talking about with "it's the cat"
this is the opposite of my take I go to hear ppl reactions and the communal part of it. I can stream it if not.
you know what speaks to the overall quality of this show is yes the editing is absolutely stunning and hilarious but i also still enjoy it when i’m just listening while driving or doing a chore
what movie are they talking about
trixies makeup is SOO good here
Who is touching 😂 I’m afraid now
Thank you for your contributions, Kerri. I'm totally serious. What a total babe.
As someone who loves to talk (I WHISPER AT MOST) during movies im am so sorry trixie i just cant stop
It's rude on how katya could walk on me and not apologise in that outfit.  So rude.... do it again.
Babbles the movie monkey is a fuckin incredible idea 😂
"Welp" with the leg slap is the Midwestern goodbye
Okay but yes, trauma dumping is rude. Like don't traumitize me at 2 pm on a Tuesday with your trauma
What movie were they talking about in 8:55?
anyone know the "it's the cat" film?
wait I'm confused is Trixie in an open relationship or is she single now??
What movie was it they were talking about when they said it's the cat
Once i was at the cinema watching the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN with the cracken and at the end of the movie when Jack Sparrow was eaten by the cracken i stand up and laugh so loud the whole cinema heard me !!!.....RUDE  🤣🤣🤣🥰🤭
Maybe I'm abs late to everything, but is any of this scripted or is the hilarity spontaneous? Frt?
Shaming the person that's talking during the movie with the director and actors etc. sounds like something Ellen would do
0:02 You do NOT look like Wendy Williams not even close
Damn y’all look fine af lol
Wendy Williams is my aunt in my head.
Too much consent 😅 these 2 kill me i love it ❤
I definitely need to stop calling this my therapy and actually go but it does make me very happy. Which is a feeling I can feel 🫠
When I went to see "Obsessed" staring Beyonce in theatres there were 3 women in their nursing uniforms sitting in front of some high school boys and turned around to them during the previews and said, "If you plan to continue to speak at that volume during the movie, I suggest you go home now." They didn't speak through the movie, and I've been trying to emulate that energy my whole life ever since.
Katya and the tambourine Legato had me crying, big props to the editor for that one 💀
What movie were they talking about?!
When I'm feeling low and need some comfort laughs I watch the unhhhh playlist 💛
Taco Tinas ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's funny bc it's not the hot girl at the movies talking. It's the 60 year old woman thinking she's whispering.
I spent too long trying to figure if Katya meant she looked like Black Eyed Peas Fergie or Prince Andrew's ex-wife Fergie until it dawned on me that she definitely meant both.
"That's how Wendy's illustrious television career wants to be eulogized" 💀
I cannot and will not get over how incredible Katya looks here.
Next episode do CONSPIRACY THEORIES
I have to know what movie they were talking about when they say the lady was saying “it’s the cat”
I showed my bf a clip of trixie and katya and he asked “who are these bald men”
Heh this episode is named after me.
Did Trixie and David breakup!
Katya's makeup, lip colour, wig and outfit are just perfection 🖤🤎❤ !
the gorrrls wanna know where the dingaling go
If they ever end this show I will surely die!! 🎉
Pete should HMU on Grindr or Scruff.... for sure!!!!!
Regina hall dying in scary movie haha for talking in the theater
I’ve had straight girls always grabbing my tits as I grew up hated ittttt
0:17 Katya listening intently vs trixie vehemently interrupting
katya is giving me khloe kardashian energy this episode idk why
I keep staring at Trixie's hands on each episode, DANG I gotta stop! haha
Is Peter available?
Katya is so stunning it’s insane
It sucks how we think setting boundaries with people is "being rude." 😒 The sooner you can learn it's ok to have them the better off in life you'll be! 😄😁❤
Uuugh touching is so rude. Everyone feels entitled to touch my stomach now I'm pregnant. It's so weeeeeirddddd. I'm gonna start doing it back to people soon.
11:30 Is it ever funny to be rude? Ask Bianca!
Are they not gonna be posted to YouTube anymore? Im not paying a sub. Lol
Okay 7:23, the way katya was like, "cutting people off is rude" as if trixie doesn't do it nonstop, but then she proceeded to cut her off from saying cutting people off is rude. I am literally dead.
When Trixie said "what would you do if someone was topping you with a wig on?" An ad popped up with the speaker immediately saying "that's a good question. I can help you answer that." And I absolutely lost my shit, the chances of that happening are insane 😂😂
This is too funny!! I am snort laughing!!
“Spotlight”. Gwendolyn I am dead!!!!!
Oh my God. Pleaaaaaase call someone out in the theatre!
We’re they watching “uninvited” where the killer was the cat? Lol if u haven’t seen the trailer…treat yourself lol
trying to figure out what movie they're talking about around @ 9:00. will report back edit: smile ? bc. bruh
I think there was something in the water during season 7, and I'd like to buy whatever it is in bulk. 💦
katya deserves the world
Babbles the cl-
Katya as Trixie continues to speak over her “cutting people off is rude” 😂
From what is Trixie's intro sentence ? "Curl weren't for her. She did not have your bone structure"
at 2:14 they used a picture of the front of my old school orange high and I flipped out🤣🤣🤣
Wendy fucking wishes you ghouls of collab of whores would
The fact that Trixie first used the welp and slapped her knees. The quintessential Wisconsin get out of my house made me very happy
I always say: *YAWN!* I've gotta go to bed, I'm gonna fall asleep!"
I hate that there's 199.9 episodes and not 200 and season 7 has ended. It hurts my brain lol
What recent movie were they talking about?!
9:23 is so fucking funny to me
Katy’s is giving mid life crises Avril Levine
Katya looks AMAZING
Katya: "Cutting people off is rude -"  Trixie, cutting her off: "MY NEIGHBOR..."
I love how many levels their stories have.
I freaking love you guys. Down to production. You guys are so awesome!
I love this make up on Katya. The colours are *chefs kiss*
Oh my fucking god the “someone yelling in a theater” thing. My late paternal grandpa was a total rotted person, but he took me to the movies ONE TIME to see Pirates of the Caribbean 3. When they all sing at the start and the soldiers go “theyve started singing sir” my grandpa shouted “NO SHIT” and i lost it. So funny and so embarrassing
"I'm gonna say it. Straight girls."
Hey trauma dumping is only rude if you're not trauma bonding
How are these two so talented at improv?! Lmao
someone please help me what is the episode where Katya talks about the Sanskrit screaming???
06:50 "if they are not rude, they are ugly" OMG 😂😂😂😂😂
I love them so much don't get me wrong, but why are they serving pee and poop this episode
shoutout to Peter for being hot and nice
I h8 when people trauma dump
the people protesting drag queens LMFAO
you can't spell "rude" without RU Just kidding
okay, but Katya looks beautiful though
Katya is the new Wendy WIlliams. Now she just needs to fall over.
I’m always afraid the white background is going to trigger another seizure lol I wanna watch them so bad
I want Pete to split me open like a bag of cheetos
they say that they barely meet up.    then tell us of that one time they were together at the most common of places, like a diner.
what movie are they talking about. with a cat?
I like to talk through movies so I just watch them at home.
2:14 my school in the backdrop love it
So funny about strait women touching your boobs. I’m a lesbo who worked at an AIDS service org, and ALL the gays would squeeze my boobs without permission 😂
So what movie were they watching where "its the cat!"? 😅
Katyas "how aRE YOu doing" has the same vibes as "i was roOTing for yoU" 😂
The idea of UNHhhh running efficiently is wild... but compared to other drag content, yes I do believe these two real-life, gorgeous women are probably the most efficient drag queens.
@3:50 there is viagra ice cream...lol..not sure how I know that? Viagra was marketed to women a few years ago but I don't think it is as effective with women I think if it does have any effect it is a placibo effect
They’re talking about puss in boots
Trixie with the classic Midwest goodbye
7:45 I need this as an alarm to wake up to and pump me up every morning
Lol they're talking about the girl at the toronto show of bald and beautiful wearing the orange string dress who partially climbed on the stage.
Feel like there's so much more tea to spill on this topic. We need a part 2!!!
The trauma dumping thing is why I dont talk bc you say something to the wrong person and they’re like “wow your bad situation makes ME feel bad let’s not talk anymore”
Katya, who designed your dress?  It is perfection!
What IS this lipstick tho
Trixie and Katya are amazing, but also the editors are hilarious.
The slapping-your-legs-and-saying-WELP to get people to leave your house is just so Midwest of Trixie and I appreciate it so much
Katya’s “How you doing?” is JOEY TRIBBIANI… not Wendy. Lmfao!
Hi collab! 0:40
Love Vanderpump lmao 🤣
😂 Trixie Definitely played to the shows theme!! Let Katya Speak a Sentence 😂😂🧡
i’m gonna need proof of pete in the bedroom, i’ll be waiting ⏱️⏱️⏱️⏱️
Still dying to know what movie has a twist involving a cat
Does anybody know what movie they were talking about where it was the car? Lmao
10:42 bubbles the orangutan 🤣
**screams in sanskrit**
This is the best theyve stayed on topic!
Remember when trixie had a crush on katya. Good times.
I just tell people "well I'm gonna kick you out"
"cutting off people is rude" katya was dropping hints 😭
I love how Katya is rabidly staring at herself in the monitor for 99% of this fillum. Can’t blame her though!
i thought trixie had a boyfriend 👀
Katya gets hotter and hotter every episode
We need more Pete content, the man is TOO GORGEOUS!!
i need katya's lip combo, im OBSESSED
Do Trixie & David have an open relationship or did they break up or something
Ah yes burping in New Delhi! Why fart and waste it when you can burp and taste it.
Waiting for the woke rags to call Katya racist for calling herself wendy williams
Where can i watch these episodes?
how are you doing? 😀🙌
Everybody gets a boner in this house buddy.
It’s not the remodel workers, it’s Katya in the vent pipes!
Props to the editors @ 3:52 😂
Denmark ❤ I feel seen and heard 11:18
😲🤤🤤🤤🤤 QUEENS, you look H A W T ! ! That mug(s) 😍 those outfits 😍🥰🥰🥰 sickening! Absolutely G O R G E O U S ✨️
omfg ! thank you, some queen said ittttt... please don't just touch my ass or tits cuz we're "friends", nuff said -
You know rude? My neighbour is hammering something at MIDNIGHT
It's rude for one person to constantly interrupt the other person to say their point when the other person is trying to speak lol
Katya is sexually confusing to me. If I'm attracted to her both when she's in and out of drag, am I bisexual?
Anyone know which movie they were referring to when they said “it’s the cat”
The WIGS ONLY BELONG ON FOUNDING FATHERS protester hahahahaha
the part about talking during movies 😭 i swear their humour is unmatched
Katya: "is that good?" I felt that 💯 1:06
katya is so attractive in this episode
I loooove this show and these women...these beautiful ballerific bomb  pu$$y having biological women GIIIIVE LIIIIFE.
it's so hilarious that these gay biological men are offended by straight women touching their fake breasts. i am so pleased.
It’s the cat
Am I the only one who loves when people trauma dump? Yes, please, I know I just met you but I’m interested
4:49 the turkey sound 😭
Trixie’s move out with me vlog telling her neighbor she’s a bitch would be incredible content
Someone please tell me what movie they were talking about
Fucking love you guys. You should have me on the show, it would get crazy.
Katya sounding like Tom Ford in the beginning with her deep voice
I’m waiting for the björk episode
I loooove when katya does her low breathy voice. Just hits the spot
The fact that I know what movie they’re talking about
Katya looks like she works at a ups call center
✨ SURPRISE! ✨
the back ground picture used at 2:20 is od my old hs building. orange high school! i wonder if someone on the unhhhh staff might be an alum.!
"its the cat" i just KNOW they saw smile
the whole part of talking during the movies....oh my god
Okay but did we figure out what cat movie they bleeped
If I were ever to be an actress, I would LOVE to hide in a movie theater and come out and yell at someone who’s talking through my movie 🤣
hahaaaaaaa pumpkin lip!  These two are proof that all xy’s love monsterous boobies!
Knee tambourine
That was in Toronto at the podcast she really tried to come right on stage. She tried. Most they did was take a phone on stage
Katya and her thing for people getting their faces snatched off @ 2:20💀💀💀
No one beats the editors for Ughhhh videos, they are A1 and in a league of their own!
My mother, when we would go see scary movies in the theater, when there were any bouts of silence in the film, she would scream at the top of her lungs to scare everyone. It was funny the first time, and then after people started getting mad. 😭😭😭
katya looks like lea michele post buccal fat removal
Trixie’s Legally Blonde quote 😂
Was that a picture of Johnny Depp sitting in the theatre? a Gilbert Grape/Benny and June JD?
God Trixie is beautiful
I don't care how much I can go see Pete on demand on his Insta, I am totally here for every time he is featured in an episode 🥵🔥
the comedy has never changed
I have really tried to start fights at movie theaters.  I told a girl I was going to kick her in the larynx and it garnered laughter from the whole audience but her.  Funny thing is.....I will throw hands if I pay to watch a movie and you want to talk with your girlfriends or boyfriend.
Anyone know what movie they were talking about when they said “it’s the cat!”?
I'm cry laughing at the fact that Katya can't stop checking herself out in the monitor this whole episode lmaoooo
I hope Trixie does more GRWM with drag artists in the future. All the ones so far have been great, Queen Pri, Heidi, Willam, Silky, Eureka, Mayhem, Katya, all iconic. Would love to see: Miz Cracker, Morgan McMichaels, Jaida Essence Hall, Maddy Morphesis, Denali, Mo Heart, Rock M Sakura.
katya that wig was thirstyyyyy
I adore Katya’s  campy deep voice  “ we should do a collaaaaab”
This one wasn't as strong for me, but that could be because both shit and mutilation came up and I get squeamish about those.
Wig glue and takis dust in your eyes if you try bad plan tbh for you not me.
Bruh someone at avatar 2 talked the entire time, they are going straight to hell
Katya's "how are you doing?" With the waving hands has me DYING laughing because it sounds so ridiculous and nothing like Wendy Williams 😂 I love it!
Not terrifier🤣🤣🤣
Katya's "F*ck you, Dog Lady" always gets me every single time
I like hearing from Peter! If they ever need to do unexpected breaks or something Peter and Fena should fill in.
trixie pulling out the midwestern *big sigh* WHELP
Katya looks so so hot here
Wait what was the movie they said they went to go see and "it was the cat"?
katya you look tired.. i hope you take some time for yourself queen ♥️
Katya screams in Sanskrit.🤣 Honey I want to know what do you scream in Sanskrit. Burping in New Delhi.🤣 These women are too cute and hilarious.
Have you ever done a colab? You should do a colab...
The other day I was watching the new black panther movie and during the beginning (which is a literal funeral) this group was talking and giggling so I got up and went over to them and calmly told them to shut tf up
10:01 this whole scene is giving Woody Allen at the theatre in Annie Hall when he brings in Marshall McLuhan.
I mean hey try having the last name rood
KATYA WILLIAMS LMFAO
*Knee slap*, welp 🌽🌽🌽
6:56 Peter I'd to meet you in the bedroom, based off the shorts and vest we might have some similar interests
7:41 omg that little black dog looks exactly like mine! You can see a video on my channel I think he is a Terrier Chihuahua mix. He even has the Gray around his face!❤
trixie sure did interrupt katya a lot. in this episode about rudeness.
I really like your outfits this episode.
Interesting choice to censor the film and not the spoiler so now any movie i see with a cat i'll know it was the cat.
WE NEED DRAG SWITCH UP FOR EPISODE 200😭😭
Does anyone else see the dramatic change in Trixie's attitude in life? In the first episodes she was so grounded. Now, she comes off like she's better than thou. Every time I need proof that fame changes people I look up Trixie. Is that bad?
If I can't squeeze your tits without consent, you can't squeeze mine. I have had many a gay man just comment on my tits and then honk honk them without my consent. I shouldn't have to laugh that off and be like "mary you're drunk." I can only smile politely for so long.   That is my late night rant.
10:38 "and the monkey go"
It’s rude to have never had an episode on bisexuals even though Trixie used to go out with one in university.
it’s so funny bc my dogs name is Katya williams😭🤣🤣
Can we just talk about how good katya looks
That was a little rude but I love you. Your portrait hangs in my bathroom. Katya and Bob are also there on postcards from a painter in London.
Trixie I love you but you just straddled that chair like George Bush getting on a great big horse!
Trixie's nose is looking SHARP in this one, oh my. Go girl, give us pointy!
And 🇳🇮 love love Messi and Trixie but they kinda could be friends too bc they are so stinking  cute and amazing
Argentina 🇳🇮 on my mind…but Trixie is giving me Messi in drag vibes
4:00 every episode of chopped
I WOULD IF I HAD SOFTIES COMING OVER
You are basically describing the late 1900's cult classic Dunston Checks In.
Is it trauma dumping if i tell someone my mom died when i was 14 cuz yeah its traumatic but it was an experience in my life. Im not trying to make people feel bad for me i just want to explain my situation. I just don’t understand the difference between trauma dumping and sharing your story
I love when Katya talks in the “gay” voice like when she was saying collab 😆
I miss Katy's goofy style
I play a little game and one of the sets of eyes you can buy are called drag doll eyes they are expensive and they are definitely knock off trixie Mattel eyes and I’m saving for them.
I hung out with Pete last week! He is really hot and really nice 😊
Dont get me wrong I love Katia's chaotic and carefree energy but I sure do miss her russian character she was soooooo good at it I am still thinking about that "Read U Wrote U" performance
Katya is serving Lorena Herrera realness
WE'VE GOT IT! xD
okay but what about the backrooms? you should talk about that  love you btw <3
Two beautiful biological women
I love it when one of the dolls knows they look fantastic and they keep checking themselves out!  This episode is Katya  playing with her hair and giving the camera sexy, sidelong looks!! I live!!! 💜👍😂
Im with Katya Trixie needs to tell rude dog lady what's up when she moves out. Why is the people that complain the loudest about noise always the noisiest fuuks
that tambourine on the knee edit sent me
Sitting here watching all these and sitting through adds and then my dumb ass remembering I brought the wow presents app 😮😂
ok but what was the movie they're talking about at 9:00
Katya looks so freaking good 😍
okay but seriously Katya what is that LIP it's perfect!
Katya looks like a housewife, the fear keeps her so thin!
8:44 why buy a ticket if you’re just going to talk the entire time!
Katya: Cutting people off is rude Also her: Gets cut off by Trixie IMMEDIATELY 😂😂😂😂
im getting sara jessica parker from katya
"just tell me you like my wig"    Trixie's heard one too many sad stories at the meet n greet
"That's how Wendy's illustrious tv career should be eulogized."
❤️❤️❤️
"is that good?" .. "do YOU think that's good?"   dead
I’d love to know what is Pete’s IG @
I think we got it 💁🏼‍♀️
I’ve said it once, I’ll say it a thousand times, Pete is unspeakably hot.
“My lack of inches in fabric does not mean you can come palpate my testes.” I love this.
same shit happened when i saw 😊 too lololl
11:15 “Burping in New Delhi… not the same as Denmark!” 😭😭😭😭
Lol same
Doesnt Trixie have a boyfriend? What are all those stories of fucking men recently?
Good god Katya looks *stunning* here. She really does amaze.
Talking during a movie even if we’re home… I’m scalping a bytch
This is one of the best episodes im cackling
It's hysterical that they did an entire show about being rude and neither of them talked about reading someone.
katyas makeup ✨🥰✨🥰✨🥰
This episode felt like a fever dream
Petter is really fucking HOT!!!
But thankfully that same day she entered the Pheta Delta Phi wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed to down from head to toe...
just so yall know theyre putting evangelical ads on your videos in canada…
When you're visibly disabled,you meet so many rude people
The editing on this one 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Warning: The Usher/monkey/uniform bit is dangerous and WILL be taken out of context and used as racial flamebait at some point. Would advise to delete that part from the video. Some free PR for you two biological White women. Good luck.
can someone please tell me what movie are they talking about when they say "it was the cat"?
LOL I've been stuck with people in my home multiple times til 4:30 am because the 'sooo....' and the 'I have to get up early' didn't work and I didn't want to be rude *faceplalm*
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SAFTEY DEPOSIT BOX!?
Hi
OMG I miss you darlings! Why do I have to re-re-resubscribe?
I love of katya is serving looks, while also looking disheveled...and her humor is hilarious
Wait now I want to know- does anyone know what movie they are talking about
not the monkey 😭😂
If I want someone to leave I just say “Well this was fun it was great to see you, let’s get together again soon!”
not katya waving her hands as a wendy williams impression when wendy does the gay hands for HOW U DO-EHHHHH 🫰
Katya looks GORGEOUS
nana was scalped
Uuughh so fucking hilarious!!!!!
I’m proud of everyone not spoiling what movie they’re talking about but I am trying to figure out what movie they’re talking about so I can watch 😂
Screaming in sanskrit 🤣🤣
Sometimes the people yelling at the movie in the theatre are the entertainment I didn’t come for but stayed for
Katya is such a good friend, she decided to do this Wendy William's mess just to overshadow Trixie's horrible Cher impression Get a friend like that
‘Trauma Dumping is rude’ 😂 so what you mean is ‘please remain silent while you’re in pain, your authentic expression is making me uncomfortable’ 😬🙄😳🤮
trixie has never been more from wisconsin than trying the "WELL" knee slap trying to get someone to leave.
Painting nails at a diner isn't cleaning one's nails at a diner. It's like doing your make-up in public. Not bad, per se. Just not the norm.
the doctor manhattan trixie lmao
Bro , someone at my rehab just got assaulted at a gas station . Ugh
I know it’s your show and you guys tend to talk about whatever you want BUT can the next subject be tattoos?
I'm so quiet that people always comment on it, but whenever I watch a movie I can't shut up for some reason😭
This is so unhinged at the end. I love it.
Anybody ever randomly blurt out …”cranberryleeeeeegggggs” 😂
why katya lowkey serving kameron michaels realness this episode
"I've never told you to shut up." "You did when I was screaming in Sanskrit." 🤯💀😂......they are unreasonably hilarious wtf  "Oh my god you have to tell this to her PLEASE" 😂  "Burping in New Deli. Not the same in Denmark."
This might count as a spoiler but for anyone curious like I was; I'm 99% sure the movie they mention at 8:58 is Smile. It makes sense not only because of what they described, but it was in theaters around the time that this would have been filmed. I could be wrong but I'd still bet money on it 😂
When I need a tw1nk to leave I just say “that hole was so fkn good I’m gonna pay for your Uber. You deserve it.”
I would love to see the whole crew of a movie come out and shame someone in the theater.
How they put Nicholas Cage and John Travolta’s faces on the board during the Face Off part… 😂🤣
The rudest thing is wyeh you are talking and a guy comes up and interrupts and your friend lets him, like oh yeah amazing... That's a rude enabler , the worst kind if rude
Is this the first ever repeated intro I hear? Trixie made this "Legally Blonde" reference as her intro in Episode 175 "Hoarding". Sorry if that was a weird fan thing to point out, I just think it's iconic
I went to see Black Panther : Wakanda Forever with my family and a family friend. My bf and I had already been arguing badly prior to the movie, so I was upset going in. When I tell you the people with me talked NONSTOP (no Hamilton haha). I wanted to strangle them. The final nail in the coffin was my sister having a full conversation on the phone. That's bad in general, but it was also at a very quiet scene. I just wanted to vanish.
No really, what lipstick is Katya wearing??
does anyone have any idea what movie theyre talking about at the "its the cat" bit??
"well" with a knee slap is The Quintessential Midwestern Goodbye and HOW DARE THEY no recognize it's Wisconsin power
I’m SO distracted by how good Katya looks. 😍
She does look like fergie
Lol
Had a neighbor that I COULDN'T STAND living above my husband and myself when we lived in an apartment. This female dog was LOUD late at night. Mostly yelling at her "boyfriend" and with her elephant feet stomping all over the floor at ALL hours of the day.
Where can I see more of Pete?
obsessed with katie this episode
i need a compilation of trixie talking about being friends with lisa vanderpump
Time for "Tattoos" themed episode
200 episodes soon Yas
NAHHHHH the STIFF Wendy Williams intro 🤣😭👏🏾👏🏾
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I got your collab right here!
Genuinely thought I’d clicked on the “Humiliation” episode and didn’t once question how off topic Trixie and Katya were the entire time
Tell me why a lady straight painted her toe nails at her table while she ate her lunch🤢🤢 she went straight to our work page 😂😂 first time in 20 years of waiting tables have I seen some trifling shit like that lmao
Really? All that money and Trixie can’t even buy decent looking shoes? C’mon…
katya looking like wendy when the topic is rude is so fitting. wendy is so rotten LOL
Pete fully put Trixie on the spot by asking her to see him in the bedroom, he so wants to breed her!!! and I would like to see it 🔥🥵
The movie face moment had me crying
CATE BLANCHETT REPRESENTATION
4:58 I WOULD DIE LAUGHING
them talking about Smile but getting it bleeped to not spoil is so slay
Fuck Katya is so fucking stunning
you know what's rude? people who turn left with no lane or light. they just sit there and hold up traffic while waiting to turn left across lanes of traffic. it makes me so furious. i would never turn left without a light or a lane.
What movie with the cat?!
Trixies wig is so blonde it is white. It’s evolving.
Slow clap to the editor for putting Nic Cage and John Travolta on the face swap board at the end 👏👏👏
Trixie needs new clothes
"You get your face back at the end of the movie" IM DEAAAAADDD
God katya is hot! I’m the straight girl they talk about, but embarrassingly 32 and not a teen🫣
I also think talking in a movie is rude but I will say, when I saw fantastic beasts, and where to find them in theaters for the first time when they show who the real villain is, and it’s Johnny Depp‘s character, it’s silent in the movie and very dramatic and some guy in the front row yelled “oh shit, that’s Johnny Depp”. And I’ll remember that fondly for the rest of my life😂
ive always been confused about trixies stories is she in an open relationship with david?
Sweeties, don’t you think the lady next door isn’t going to be sent this and will make sure her dogs yap extra loud while your place is being shown for sale? Never diss the neighbor until after the sale! Love you crazy kids.
“Watch men… dressed as women”
Yup, talk during a movie and the movie monkey rips your face off
Everything a person you don't like DOES, it's rude
Tell pete i said hey zaddy
Why does Trixie always looks fat in or out of drag. Disgusting! Katya always looks good how you doing Katia
Katya looks fucking amazing
5:32 IM SORRY…WHAT?!?!
What shade is it? Oompa Loompa Afterglow Unhhhh
Trixie cutting off Katya for the entire video is fitting for the theme😂😂😂
If people get upset because THEY couldn’t get the hint that’s not your problem.
Anyone know what movie they were talking about when they said “it’s the cat! It’s the cat!”
hOw u dOin hoooW are U doing
they look like the before and after of a storebought walmart banana after 4 days
I need the brand/color of Katya’s lipstick
The Elle Woods reference from trixie was right on time.
Quit saying, “collab”.
Love katya's identity crisis the entire video
Unnhhh topic idea- they talk about unnhhh
Ok but trauma dumping is like impulse. I cant stop when somethin reminds me of it and I bring it as humor but end up ruinin the vibe
Wtf did I just watch 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
One time these teenage girls in a movie were talking So loud and looking at shit on their phone for like. A ridiculous amount of time. And some middle aged woman eventually goes up behind them and shushes them like impossibly loud. And people clapped. And they did stop
Can y'all do an episode where y'all talk about first impressions? 🙏
I feel like Katya always looks like jessalyn gilsig but particularly in this one
These 2 are a mood
Katya referenced that lady getting her face ripped off by a monkey and YouTube showed me an ad for saving monkeys. I think not.
3:15 FACTS
I LOVE that Katya doesn't know the "How you doin'?" line. It warms my cold, snarky heart.
“Pinched a loaf” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
im begging someone to help me figure out what movie theyre talking about with “ITS THE CAT!” pls help
THE TAMBOURINE AT 10:32 DNJDJDEJKDKDKE
Can we get an episode of nice things
Katya looks like my mum. It used to weird me out so much, but now I just think of her as my mother
the editing on this series deserves an award.
I thought Katya saying "so delicious" was Peter saying "Fergilicious"!
WTF is this?
07:00 I wouldn't mind seeing Peter in the bedroom
Trixie is right about trauma dumping. I don't need to hear about your whole life I'm just trying to take your order. 🤣
Wait what film?  It was the cat???  What movie!!!!!!!
Pete. The secret sex symbol of this show.
I love how they’re both wearing a color blocked dreas
Why is the dude on the right getting so fat
katya i agree with trixie. i love that lip color. its fergalicious
Is Trixie's relationship an open one, or is it all just jokes?
trixies makeup is so soft she’s like not wearing any makeup anymore its so stunning and fresh and boots and yass
Poor Cate
KATYA IS GAGGING ME
I literally work with a “hot girl” and she’s so loud and obnoxious but nobody ever corrects her or tells her to STFU even if you can hear her around the floor 😩 it’s true that they have different rules.
Its honestly confusing to me how these are still good. Like i dont even like trixie and katya like that but these are still entertaining
living whenever i catch glimpses of katyas yoga teacher swag. i see you girl sanskrit gets me going too
Trixie looks sooooooo fuckin FABULOUS in this episode!! I mean, every episode obviously, but GOSH I love this look 😍
I just love the editing. sooo entertaining!
Ffffrrrryyy
Ok but is that really Peter, is for research purposes 👀
Boi 😆
Uuufff  Fuck Meee ❗
Is it just me or has trixie slightly changed her eye makeup recently? I love it
Screaming? in Sanskrit? WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
“No Gwendolyn” 🤣
How is katya looking hotter & hotter everytime 👏🏽 hot mami
"Grab her face by the mouth"... yes.
I love how Trixie calls Lisa Vanderpump just Vanderpump.
YEEEHHH
Katya: I look like Wendy Williams Me: *Looks up Wendy Williams* Me: You do indeed look like Wendy Williams
"Is it ever funny to be rude?" Yeah, when you're a billionaire profiting off of exploitation and get boo'd off of a stage, I think that's pretty fucking funny.
I would like to know where it costs $18 to see a movie nowadays Ms. Katya, because RUDE for not telling us 😂❤
Katya looks like Kelly mantle combined with Sandra bullock. Stunning
As a Dane I can confirm: We do burp a lot and it is a common thing here.
Topic suggestions: Art, Literature, Diet, Bisexuality, Gay Tribes, Dancing
They looks so beautiful
i've loved you too for a long time but please don't ruin it by advocating for drag story time or doing drag for kids
OK but I actually do need to know where to get Katya's orange lipstick
Did Trixie and Katya see Smile in a random theater in Utah because if so that was me. I’d like to apologize for getting out of pocket but I was shook 😂
I love it when they use their Amanda Lepore voice!
Just realised trixies wig is just white
I want to see Trixie do a video where she uses a BeDazzler. Anyone else?
“how are YOU doing😄🎉👏🏻🤸‍♀️”
My dad would pull out don't you have a wife at home waiting for you when he was done with a person and wanted them to leave. Usually it was a nephew overstaying his welcome.
“I look like Fergie 🙄” I AM CACKLING 😭😭😭😭
I'm glad the Midwestern goodbye lives on in Trixie
Is Trixie single now? I thought she was with David? :(
omg Trixie you're stunning !
do they ever say " Rude Paul " ?
Episode suggestion: Cartoons
Katya: "Cutting ppl off is rud..." Trixie: *proceeds to cut Katya off
“wigs only belong on founding fathers” 💀
That hair looks so f*cking good Lois.
GRABBING AT THE HAMBURGER MARYS😭
Willy Nelson looks great!
The funniest moment is when Katya points her fan at Trixie when mentioning ugly tax!!!🤣😂🤣 Shaaaaaady!!!!
I don’t know why, but this thumbnail is so overwhelming to me 😂😂😂 I was like “Is this UNHhhh or Rude with Katya Williams?” 😂😂😂
“You can get your face back at the end of the movie” 😭😭😭
I literaly loved this episode, this is my comfort show Lmao
Trixies neighbor watching this like: oh wow👀👀
Katya is absolutely gorgeous here…
Trixie using the same intro again😭
8:58 not only that when we were watching Wakanda forever and the fucking people in the front row were RECORDING THE MOVIE AND TALKING SUPER LOUD??? LIKE WTF??
two perfect divas slaying and huntying
We come to this place for magic  We come to UNHhhh to laugh, to cry, to care .  Because we need that, all of us  That indescribable feeling we get when Katya touches Trixie's arm and we go somewhere we've never been before.   Not just entertained, but somehow reborn together. Dazzling images on a small cracked screen. Bird noises I can feel.  Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.  Our heroes feel like the best part of us, and stories feel perfect and powerful.  Because here… they are.
Omg I think they were talking about the movie "smile" lmao I went on a date and the guy loudly said "IT'S THE CAT" and I was SO embarrassed 😂😂
Trauma dumping is when you randomly start spilling your trauma to people you don’t know well and act like it’s not a big deal. Trauma dumping ISN’T asking your friends if you can vent to them. Don’t be afraid to open up to your friends.
The obvious choice for Wendy William intro is “oh she died? Oh…ehm…..ok”
6:16 i KNOW for a damn FACT they're talking abt that girl from just for laughs toronto live podcast recording i wanted to ducktape her to her seat
Both makeup looks are incredible today!!
Editor, please add subtitles whenever the director speaks 😢
What's the movie they were talking about? 😭
now I wanna see Peters instagram:-)
The fact that the topic is rude and Trixie interrupting Katya never got brought up 🫣
Just dropping in to say I would LOVE to see Trixie and Katya on H3, you both with Ethan and Hila would be a vibe
Katya doing cosplay of Jessica made by Pearl
Cant end an episode with poopiez
10:25 hahahaaaaahahahaha
I’m sorry but I must pedantically point out that orang-utans are not monkeys, rather, they are apes. Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, and gibbons are also apes! Monkeys and apes are similar creatures, but monkeys have tails, and apes do not. Apes are also generally larger and more intelligent.
100% the cat is related to smiley, i did the same while watching it from home
I hate the guy who asks interview like questions to keep them "on topic" so much just HATE HATE HATE
Lol the Fergie comment at the end. Better than the Wendy comparison but they both look stunning!!
Ok but Trixie looks STUNNING this episode
Katya looks HOT!
“Too much consent” LOL I’m using that
Cant believe im here every single Wednesday to watch two blonde bimbos rambling stupid shit for 10 minutes
The editing this ep was a whole show on its own I'M HOWLING (not bowling)
I've always thought Pete was hot so now I'm vindicated.
I had to google that monkey and just so everyone know Bubbles is alive!
Right canceling on Trixie is strange especially knowing she has the most subscribers amongst rugirls
1:35 Three inches from the table is not on the table! 😂
how are YOU doing
What is Katya’s lip color?? 😭😭
what was the cat movie lol
I wonder if (the trick) that Trixie kicked out is watching this video like "....that RUDE BITCH!" 🤣
come on Legally Blonde <3
That wig on Katya….I have so much to say.
the boob squeeze triggered me and i pushed trixie away 💀
Katya has never looked SO GOOD and frankly, I'm in distress.
Trixie you better read that b**ch when you move, make us all proud!!
I'm a transwoman and had cis women grabbing my breasts at parties too. So rude.
i cannot stop looking at katya in this video, my god she is gorgeous
you know trixie has made it when she casually refers to lisa vanderpump as "vanderpump"
So curious what film the cat was?
The tambourine wrecked me ❤
People do snort viagra, special K is there thriving in some circles.
Katya’s outfit & makeup ❤ 🔥
Katya: "It's rude to cut people off." Trixie: *Oblivious*
Katya slowly giving up realising she looks like Fergie
8:59 I know exactly what movie, cause my girlfriend said the same thing, but just because she realized it a second before I did. She also whispered it, lmao, so it’s fine
i love trixie's look here
That cinema story was WILD 😂
Omg I’m sorry but during that movie o totally said “it’s the cat!!!”
I understand what Katya is saying 72% of the time.
Seeing Singapore's hdb flat as stock photo background for UNHhhh is wildd eoirjweoirjweo
Lol... It is rude to burp in New Delhi Katya... I live here... Trust me...
Pete is hot 😍😍😍
I love how the censorship sounds are really quiet or late 😆 fu YouTube !
Start sweeping when you want someone to leave or place your broom upside down lol
Is this a reupload?
Confronting a rude neighbor is easy. Selling to the people you know that person will hate the most shows true commitment
Love Katya's boots!! Love her fun style!!
I absolutely love these omg
You forgot roommates 😂😂😂
Trixie: "I never tell you to shut up." Katya: "Yes you did, but I was screaming in Sanskrit..." That's goddamn GOLD people! That is fucking *vampire* humor Netflix couldn't come up with.
what movie are they talking about with the cat ?
I would never try my grandmas wig because it’s the same wig Elton John wears. Istg she looks like him… my mom wore her wig when she went as Elton John for Halloween a few years back… they are identical if you don’t look close enough
Am i going crazy but did that first conversation already happen before?
Being rude at the movies...Ladies, this a topic that I have A LOT of thoughts on.
Peter is one of the hottest cutest men alive and I'm sticking witht that.
I know exactly what movie they are talking about because when I got to that scene while I was watching in my home I was yelling at my screen “it’s the cat” LMAOO
Katya’s energy is such a mood. I wouldn’t ever be rude. I live
"It's a cat!"   I bet the movie they saw was "The Smile"
I don’t like how on topic they are staying 😂😂😂
Okay but like… I am SO glad they edited the movie title that they were spoiling holy shit. Like that was the simplest thing but damn it made me feel good. I hate having things spoiled for me.
Love that Katya uses Trixie saying “I think we got it” as an example of her being rude when she literally says it in the intro! 😂
Rudest thing you can sat about Trixie and Katya : GO!
Katya screaming in Sanskrit
Katya drop the freaking lipstick name-ahhhh!! I screamed when Trixie asked and had my wallet out only to cry when Katya didn't say it :'( It's such a beautiful color
The movie theatre one yes absolutely. Although I got yelled at once for talking during the commercials so some people are just dicks
Katya tried every which way to sneak in comments about how ugly she thought her look was today. It just seemed so..... "Rude". 😉
Katya out of a red lip is too much, she's too calm, too collected, too together. I need my crazy red lipped whore back
Please stop the over- editing.  I loved watching both of you on your own.. the whole point.  The comedy is enough.
I actually love when people make jokes in the theater when it's the right movie. One time me and my family were watching a scary movie in the theater (the one where the girl's twin is haunting her or something). The theater was filled with loud teenagers and I'll never forget when one of the characters was being chased, somebody yelled out "Run, bitch, RUUUUUNNNNN!!!"  Lmao it was so funny everyone in the theater was laughing hysterically. My family is the type to laugh and joke during the whole movie, no matter how serious it is lol. When we went to see Black Swan, my mom was laughing non-stop she couldn't help it🤣
2 natural women 😌❤️💗
especially Pete
Katya looks GORGEOUS
I bet the movie they are talking about is Smile!
Love that lip on Katya
I choked on my water seeing Trixie as Doctor Manhattan on the poster 🤣 I wasn’t ready
so my bf & I were in a movie by ourselves the other night and this guy i clocked as from behind the concessions came in at like 35 min in and just left. he thought he had a safe space to whack it right? and us being there was just rude?
Pete showing his deep voice at the 7:02 mark was jarring, and I can never unhear it. 😈
I NEED to know what lipstick Katya is wearing!!!
Okay, one of you BlackGirlMagic goddesses needs to take Trixie to a movie in Harlem.
anyone know "recent film"?
What movie are they talking about when they say “it’s the cat?”
"Burping in New Delhi isn't the same as burping in Denmark" - Katya 2022
Wait wait wait I need someone to explain to me how and why trauma dumping can be seen as rude?
How are you doing?
"If they're not rude, they're ugly. Trixie, you're so rude!
Pete saying, “You should see me in the bedroom.” Come onnnnn!!!
Where you b….es been???? I have been missing you so much. I have been going back to old episodes because I adore you both so much. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤from your Aussie b….. mate
the matching similar looking fits are so cute
This is trixie’s expensive makeup look from 9 months ago.
Peter :)
Four minutes about rude fans- “what about fans being rude?”  Story about a hot person being rude- “what about hot people being rude?”
want more katya, you know she would say more if she was aloud to say more... its the cat
omg Trixie is redoing the "curls weren't right for her, she didn't have your bone structure" intro haha
A whole episode of being Rude and not one mention of Trixie chronically interrupting Katya. 😶
Trixie should do a 'collab' with the h3 podcast... pleeeeease
That dog lady is called Bianca Del Rio
I put this on for my dyslexic aunt and she didn’t get it
It's funny to be rude to bloody children.
I think this is the first time Trixie didn´t speak at all during the ending.
burping in new delhi .. not the same as denmark 💋💋
Trixie mentioning Cate Blanchett just combined my two worlds
I had almost completely forgotten about Katya’s morning, “YEEEUH”, but thanks to this episode, I’ll be digging that one up from the catacombs. I love suddenly remembering old beloved clips. 😊
Katya wig lol
I just have to note the "I think we got it comment" when it's in the intro from Katya to every episode 🤣
Speaking of RUDE. My neighbors that live below me, banged their ceiling (my bedroom floor) because I vacuumed at like 4pm, meanwhile these creatures are  playing loud-ish music close to 9pm/10pm sometimes
hey tracy i like ur wig
Hasn’t trixie used that same intro before lmao
"Almost consent": roflcopptr  yes
Yaaaassss collab with Jenn from Fundie Fridays on YouTube! She loves you and she’s the best!!
It was the tambourine knee slap for me
I really do wanna know what Katya’s lipstick is!
Wurq Wendy.
This whole episode is just Katya biting her tongue from screaming at Trixie that other people have things to say and you’re fxcking RUDE! Btw Trixie is rude and I love her for it. 😅😂
I hade to say, those two bald goblins in a dress looks particularly good today! 😍😍😍
I'm just gonna say it: I'd dick Pete down within fuckin MILLIMETERS of his life. Like, the kind of dick'n Trixie wanted from Paul Hollywood-that's WTF I'm talkin about 🙌🥵😏
Is trixie single now??
I can’t believe I’m saying this 198 episodes later, but this one is my favorite. Trixie knowing what she’d say to her neighbors the day she moves out really got me.
Trixie’s neighbor watching this video🤣💀
"its the cat"??? you watching MIB 2?
omg Pete stahhhhhp
I just HOPE we get the christmas episode mid february to keep the vibe from Halloween
I’m so glad Katya loving her biracial moment of being Katya Wilkins ❤🎉
Nxde
Omg I know the movie you’re talking about and I blurted out it’s the cat in the theater.
Love you guys so much❤
Katya looking at the Director like - I told you I’d say something 👀 2:08 Trixie realizing what Katya was trying to say 5:56 💀
2:14 cringe
That part about straight girls is so true. Especially white and black Americn girls! Funny how they hate straight men creeping up on them but seem to lose the concept of personal space when it comes to drag queens and gay guys.
That might be the worst Wendy Williams impression I have ever heard. I love it 😂
I want to take with my brain a screenshot of how beautiful katya is looking here and keep it there forever and ever
I swear these women get more and more beautiful if we don’t stop them soon I don’t think anyone will be able to
I'm just saying I need a list of cosmetics used in this episode. Trixie's lip color is IT.
Trixie showing her roots. There is nothing more Midwestern than intricate daydreaming of what to say if a stranger is rude to you
Trixie will never be able to say "I think weve got it" without feeling guilt ever again! :(
Cancelling on a Trixie collaboration is so dumb. She'll give you the most exposure out of any Queen besides Ru.
Are they looking really hot or am I just high as a kite
what movie are they talking about?
Interrupting people’s sentences is pretty rude
Trixie’s watchmen poster 😭🫶🏼
1:31 Sensitive topics being resolved for the first time…. On camera. 🤣🤣💀 💀
The fact Katya waking up and screaming in Sanskrit to start her day somehow makes me simultaneously go "I have a lot of questions" and "That explains a lot."
Sosie Bacon comes up like “how could you during my film?”
This seems like new editing? Just me?
Anyone know what movie they are talking about at 9:14
WE’D ALL RISK EVERYTHING FOR PETER 🏳️‍🌈❤️‍🔥🙏🏾
Katya is ready to do drugs again and Tricia Martel is so bored that she’s here for it
As soon as Katya said “It’s the cat” I knew exactly what movie she was talking about and what a HUGE waste of time it was oh my god 😂
4:24 I actually laughed too loudly at “that actually sounds fun” lol what boy doesn’t want to dress up in Nana’s wigs? I feel like I couldn’t have been the only gay boy who thought it was fun to parade around in my mom’s nightgown.
Interesting.
Katya's Wendy impression is SO GOOD. WOW.
what movie are they talking about?? 9:00
Trixie is right, Love that lip color on Katia 🥰😍 she looks gorgeous 😍
I love when they talk about movies as a person from Australia that never has to deal with this
When they say “it’s the cat”… what movie are they talking about?
I just have to post this with the small chance it will be seen. I'm in law school and we just wrote our exam for contract law. And apparently our professor is a fan, because our fact patter was about Trixie try to sue Katya for a cannabis business she started. Your officially broken into academia
the way i immediately knew they were talking about Smile when they brought up the cat😭😭😭
Screw Wendy Williams.  You should dress like Wendy O Williams.
I wouldn't be surprised if we never saw Denise Richards again.
"Hot people are always rude. If they're not rude they were ugly."   Trixie stating the stone cold FACTS. No one is kinder than the ones who know what its like on the other side.
No what's rude is dropping this on the same day as Scream 6 teaser trailer. I can't watch two videos at once, ladies
How about when the trade won’t leave because they’re trauma dumping
OMGGG THE MOVIE MONKEY!!
Hello you there, Hey!!😁😄what is going on honey s, I had  the coolest Dream about Trixcy we had a jam,session together, I love her, to death, Hey babe while your at it ,now teach me how to spell, and hello,Katya,where have you been,,,?
I think it is important to note how sometimes you literally have to be rude for someone to get the fucking point. Like if someone I don't want to ever see again in my life keeps asking to hang out, is it more rude to just never respond or to say "I really don't want to hang out with you"
Katya isssssss the beauty queen. The beattttttt
"im just say it: STRAIGHT GIRLS"
I am OBSESSED with Trixie's look in this episode holy shit she looks STUNNING
What movie is with the cat?
Rude.  My daily grind
Obsessed with Katya chanting Sanskrit in the AM...
they didn't talk about interrupting people lol
Lol I forgot about Katya waking up.   "YEEEEEEEP"
Ugly tax points at Trixie 🤣🤣🤣🤣
SANSKRIT YASSSSSSSS
the elephant in the room: interruption lol
what is fergalicious
Not to be rude (see what i did there?) But wtf was that Wendy's impersonation? 💀
Katya’s “And how are you doing” just drove me off of the 405
Katya's dress is stunning
YOLO !!!!!   I’m going for it…KATYA CAN I HAVE THIS WIG???!!!!  I’m in love!!!!!!!
i can't believe tracey finally crossed over with the travis the chimp reference after all these years of katya bringing it up!  sooo great
Katya as Wendy Williams had the opportunity to say "She's an Icon, she's a legend and she is the moment, Katya" as her introduction and she missed it. Ill never recover.
How appropriate that yall brought up wendy on the rude episode. Work
Not katya talking about the terrifier
Tome mi foto! ❤😂🎉
the editing of these videos is always so impressive every time
Such an especially hilarious episode the face snatching, Kate blanchet pinching a loaf everything 😂
Katya looking like one of the Olsen twins is everything
Hear me out...Next episode, let's not click on it so it get no views. I want to see the world burn. Team work!
OKAY WHAT MOVIE HAD THE CAT THOUGH????
Why did they have to photoshop Peter shirtless? 😂 he’s always shirtless on the Inter webs
ALL THE TRADES BEING OLD MEN I CANT- 😂
Watched this on the toilet
what movie was it the cat?
What recent movie were they talking about ?
Quit COMING for hot girls some of us are on your side, Brenda
The fact that at 4:53 after Trixie asked that, I got a PrEP ad that started by them saying “honestly….” has me rollinggg😭😭
Katya outfit is life right now.  ❤
I want more anecdotes of Trixie's rudeness! ...That's a good name for a drag daughter: Rudy Mattel. Whatever.
Trixie looks like a sunshine goddess in yellow.
Katya looooks so haaaawt
I don’t know if its just me, but when they do the intro and say “Unhhh” Katya gives me “real orgasm face” and Trixie does “fake orgasm face”.  I don’t know why I thought of that. I guess I’m nasty. 😭😂 I love you mommies. 😘
Me driving with this on my cars Bluetooth & thinking i was about to get in an accident with those car horn sounds
As a straight middle aged woman, ok  I would  never grab your boobs or any part of your body other than your arm, simultaneously trying to telepathically connect with you to be my new bestie. WE straight women LOVE you and I hope you accept it🤷‍♀️🤩. I don’t know why but we feel you.
Do a "Rules" Episode!!
thank you for posting this on my birthday. I've found another reason to live 🥳
why haven't they been getting as many views lately
Me watching this and my 5 year old walks by… Me: Don’t they look great? Better than me! My 5 year old: Way better than you!  Rude. 😂
Katya is morphing into the Russian teacher
can anyone please tell me the cat movie? lmao
they teach me so much
i’m surprised they didn’t say death to them all when talking about wendy williams
And fucking stop whining about ''hot people privilege'', there is NO SUCH THING, stop living in a hollywood 90s film where ''it girls'' are rude and obnoxious. Develop your comedy, don't repeat something for a millionth time!
7:04, 😆
I mean, I love Pete. Always have.
Trixie wtf is WRONG WITH YOU??? EDITORS WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU? You have to understand that some jokes are off the table like comparing some nuisance WITH GENOCIDE, THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO KNOW WHAT REAL GENOCIDE IS!!!!! I come here for comedy not to get TRIGGERED over some pampered privileged drag queen throwing such words around comparing some trivial thing to A GENOCIDE THAT WE UKRAINIANS ARE GOING THROUGH!!! WTF you crossed all the lines!!!
Are we not going to talk about how miss Katya, the transvestite hooker from Ekaterinburg, wakes up every morning SCREAMING IN SANSKRIT???
katya: cutting people off is rude   trixie: *cuts her off*
they look so good in this episode.
I thought my partner screaming in the shower every morning was just him. Good to know it’s part of Katya’s morning routine too.
The most robotic voice: “How are YOU doiNG?” - Wendy Williams
Why did they bleep out the title of the 'cat' movie?
In high school, I (a female loner) was gifted a sucker by a trusted friend that was secretly heavily laced with viagra. I thought maybe I was looking cute that day, with all the male attention I was getting, but it was just an inside joke. So if anyone is wondering, no, it does nothing for ladies.
Katya may be the only drag queen on the face of the Earth who wakes herself up in the morning by screaming in Sanskrit.
Neighbour thing... have THIS old hag who on inspection of apartment, bitched the WHOLE time,gave off airs of..."I'm Too good for THESE peasants.." etc...well, she's obviously moved in and talks to no one!. She cooks SUCH bad food,she leaves it for strays...who EVEN bypass IT 🤣🤣. She hides like a 5 year old around corners to ignore us ALL and has the VERY limited friends she has, to side eye us too!. I HATE her after trying to kick my cat and the scrag knows IT MOST DEFINITELY...on the daily,if possible!.
This episode was so funny omfg
I wish Katya replaced Wendy instead of Sherry lmao
“I look like fucking Fergie” I SCREAMED
Katya saw Terrifier 2, of course
im crying by the first second, i look like wendy williams lol
Yay!  We're doing Santa Con at the gay bar this weekend !! 🎅🎶🇨🇦
200th episode is almost here eijsiajakabksj how have we been doing this for so long
Trixie is turning into the rude gay we all hated in high school.
1:55 why do I feel like I've seen this part before? must be deja vu
Katya looks amazing
This show has the best editing on all of YouTube
10:32 salute to the editors for masking around katya's fingers for the tambourine slap 😅😅
Trixie's hatred of women coming out again.
Not Katya criticizing Trixie about that "I think we're good" moment, meanwhile LITERALLY on the intro of this season Katya says "I think we got it". The irony! Don't let them bully you Trixie! <3 HAHAHAHAHA!
I want both of them in the same outfit they needed to exchanged wigs.   It would be terrible but I want to see it.
What is this mystery censored film where it's the cat
No the worse combo is mean and ugly
ten seconds in and katya looks so good i am going to die, probably
I always have to deal with rude people at movie theatres.  One time I took my friends to see a movie I'd already seen, I really enjoyed it and I knew they would too. There were some teenagers that obviously snuck in to a random movie and were just yelling and talking loudly. After about 10 minutes of it I yelled "shut up or I'll make you shut up" and a couple minutes later they walked out of the theatre.  The other time, I went with my partner to see a movie in Gold Class (like the fancy theatre where they bring you food during the movie and the tickets cost an arm and a leg)   You assume, for the price, that people wouldn't be rude but what do you know, a couple brought their small children, who were being noisy. I brushed it off, but then they pull out an iPad and put on random YouTube videos at FULL VOLUME for their kids during the movie????? I never walked out so fast and got an employee to come in and tell them to stop.   Like seriously how can people be so rude???
I was at that show in Toronto where the girl got up and stood at the foot of the stage 😂
What movie?
"I look like F**kin Fergie" 🤣🤣
They were talking about people talking during the movies, and it brought me back to my rage at a group of teenagers who talked throughout most of the movie Smile, then Trixie literally mentioned Smile
Pete IS hot!
Omg! Katya legit is giving Biological Rich Milf, im gagged on how much she’s developed ☺️💖
Katya over here looking like a *complete* snack!
Katya putting some bass in her voice is *chefs kiss* and she looks stunning today!
Katya you better give up that actual lipstick shade bitch
For some reason “you don’t get a priiiiiiize” absolutely sent me 🤣
You guys should do an episode reacting to youtube comments <3
10:31
:-)
What movie is it with the cat?
6:39 THE WATCHMEN POSTER LMAPOO
RIP Wendy Williams
I think from now on instead of the classic “no shit, Sherlock” we should say “Thanks, Columbo”
I just want these ladies on every billboard, TV channel & radio station serving content content content.
Queens bail on Tricia’s YouTube appearances? Isn’t that like super dumb? It’s good publicity and you’re just strait chillin right? Lol 😂 ❤ u TrixiKat
The “WELP…” and leg slap combination only works on Midwesterners, ma’am.
I THINK WE GOT IT 🤬🤬🤬
I thought Trixie bought a house? Or is this another apartment on top of the house she already owns?
PLEEZE "I LIKE TO WATCH" GLOW UP SEASON 4!!!  LOVE YA🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
I'm rude but it's in defence of people. You complain about her? What makes him so special? What dose he do around here that no one else can? My work loves and hates me.
Kathy's boots are cool.😎
I know Trixie's likes pastels, esp pink. But Trix, you look so good in black!!!😍😍
This is your sign to start telling people to STOP TALKING IN MOVIE THEATERS. Like girl this is public space, who fucking raised you ??
Being the *rude* friend while your friends back you up like 🤗🤗🤗
What signs are you two? My guess, Trixie's a Virgo. Maybe is a Sagittarius💋💋
they saying pete isnt ever rude made me remember Trixie saying "dont snap at people Pete its rude" and he goes "dONT sNAp at mE"
1:04 at first I thought Katya was doing Joey Tribbiani
"Hi, do you have a second? You're a HUGE bitch!"
That bit about strangers asking about your genitals hit hard, as a trans person. It's like the second question I get asked, after "oh, you're trans?" Straight to "what bits do you have?"
Trixie you should collab with Jen on Fundie Fridays!
Katya serving secretary realness who's having an affair with her much older boss 😂
Katya wow this look is a new plateau
I saw a news anchor wearing the same thing as Katya   Same colors and pattern   Katya genuinely wore it better
6:56 - That's all you need from this episode.
White Wendy Williams
Now I wanna know which movie they were talking about where it was the cat😂
growing up in michigan, i wouldve been running out the door at the first welp and thigh slap  lmao
KATYA IS SO BEAUTIFUL
looking back at katya’s outfits compared to now😭😭
Trixie asking Katya a question then cutting her off as she answers. 😂 Also, if Trixie’s dog lady neighbor sees this vid, she won’t have to confront her.
I was crying over not finding a job in R&D in cosmetics in brazil, but now, after seeing the episode, im better now! U guys are A MA ZIIING
“Oh is that what we’re doing?” Katya constantly being out of the loop
Did Pearl do Katya's makeup? Brown lipstick?
Jesus god Katya looks AMAZING.
9:00 what movie did they see?
I’m so confused about that cat😂
What movie are they talking about a cat?  I don't care about spoilers.
Katya is so HOT 🔥
Omg I can’t stand yapping dogs🔥. You do have a course of action though, most buildings have barking dogs written into the agreement & they include dogs barking inside, not just on porches. On the rare chance that isn’t the case, you can call Animal Control & they’ll come out & talk to the owner & get a case started with you. You might have to do a Bark Log depending on the state but if you do it’s very easy & absolutely worth it.   I know how infuriating this issue can be, I know you’re moving & probably dgaf anymore, just a little tip in case it ever happens again.
I rarely comment on YouTube; but OMG Katya is especially gorgeous in this one!  Really a lovely color wig.
Lately the TRAUMA DUMPING is out of control. Get Betterhelp 😊
This isn't said enough but trixie has such a beautiful nose. shape, bridge, everything.
Anytime I see there’s a new unhhhh I squeal with happiness!! I love you girls so much!!
"If you're hot enough, nothing's rude."  I was seriously wondering why nobody has ever called me rude before. I just thought it was because I'm nice.
Also, what was the damn movie they were talking about?!?
i can't wait for them to go on tour in america again wahhhh they are tooo funny
Katya: cutting people off is rude..- Trixie: mY NeIgHbor...
wait omg please can someone explain to me why it'd be rude to paint your nails in a diner? i'm not american and i wouldn't think twice about someone painting their nails anywhere im so scared now. what if i've painted my nails somewhere inappropriate?
Pete really is hot😔✋🏽
For some reason, Katya looks like the child of Wendy Williams and Adele. I can't unsee it. 🤭
Ugh. Overly entitled straight girls thinking it's totally cool to grab parts of your body. I can't.🙄
PSA Trixie Motel is on hbo max and it is SO good
katya giving julia fox
Ironically the rudest thing I’ve seen recently was two girls loudly talking through Trixie and Katyas live show in Hamburg
Wait, doesn’t Trixie have a boyfriend?
You KNOW Trixie timed it so she KNEW this episode would play AFTER she'd already left her place to go live with David so when her old neighbor sees this she won't be able to try any shit 😂
WHY❓ U think about NUDE cause your view's so RUDE
I have never related more to Trixie as a fellow Wisconsinite than when she did the double knee slap/passive-aggressive "Well!" maneuver.  When we do this, it's a polite way to say "We're done here, hit the road."
Pete gets to be rude when he asks permission first.
What movie are they talking about, "it's the cat!"?
Katya's Wendy impression was as good as Trixie's Cher
Dying for season 8 ❤
Snorting Viagra may not be a thing, but I have a friend who claimed he did.  One day in high school his guy in my class was looking ROUGH. He told a bunch of people in the class that he snorted 3 pills of viagra the night before and has now had a raging boner for 12 hours and couldn't sleep because of the pain. I definitely believed him, cuz I could see the lil bulge all period. The next day he looks worse. Can't stand or walk right, he's crouching and holding his stomach all day, and he looks terrible.  Then he misses 3 days of school and comes back the next week saying he was in the hospital and it's the most awful pain he's ever been in, and the doctors couldn't do anything to help him, just monitor him.  I think about this a lot
Adding - Talking on their phone vol. 100% in a crowd.
Now I’m wondering what movie they were talking about with the cat  Edit: Never mind, I figured it out
Trixie and Katya are serving honey and caramel lewks today
Katya only wearing those “nasty brown lips” after Pearl’s makeover🤌🏽
Wigs only belong on Founding Fathers 😆
At the end when Katya mentioned Terrifier my heart ❤❤
Katya recently told Pearl she can't stand a brown lip, only red, and now she's fine with it? Growth?
Talking in a movie theater, on par with genocide….yes seems true. 8:45
love u ladies so much, and can not wait for next episode. yall crack me up and always make me smile
Oh my god, Katya's look is fucking incredible. The hair and makeup especially! Also I love that she snuck a Terrifier reference in at the very end, those movies are absolutely the nastiest, grossest movies I've ever seen, speaking as a horror nut.
I love the Midwesterner in Trixie that "Welp" and a knee slap would work to get someone to leave.
They should calm down a little bit with the editing.
I literally can’t take my eyes off katya this episode, she looks so goooodddddde.
Nicole Kidman and Dolly Parton looks good here
Love Katya wearing my favorite Rottweiler colors
I had a dream that Katya was on my high school track team with me last night
I'm so excited for episode 200, these cross dressers better bring it.
What film were they talking about
considering the times we live in, 2:14 hits hard but made me chuckle.
Katya needs an episode with someone who has had their face ripped off by monkey or any other way because she is obsessed. It would be an interesting interview.
I got so pissed because I saw an episode where trixie said "this is our last one" and I thought they ended this show
I once went to a screening at the Prince Charles Cinema in London where they hired people dressed as Ninjas who would sneak up and whisper a warning in your ear if you were being too loud during the movie. (In return, the Ninjas got to watch movies for free.)
katya pls give me a chance
Katya's Wende Williams is iconic and tragic and all those -ics
when I want someone to leave my house i simply say "get out me swamp". works like a charm
06:56 👀
"Trauma dumping" GIRL! I just started a new job last week and 10 minutes into a shift, one of the girls was telling me about how her drunk, abusive boyfriend just dumped her and she spent 2 hours crying on the phone with him. I hadn't even learned her name yet!
Did I get intro-resistant? because I haven't laughed at UNHhhh's intros and I am not okay with that
I have a friend who just saves up all his rudeness for Karen encounters. Like, he’s the first person to help an old lady with her groceries but if he catches someone berating the grocery store cashier for no reason, he’s a pithy sniper
I was at that show with that girl, it was rather uncomfortable to watch.
the gift that just keeps giving
Trixie asking Katya what the ordinary people do with viagra - do they snort it? Do they put it on birthday cakes?
It's rude to interrupt people bald
🤣😂🤣
I stumbled out of bed at 3pm sick as a dog and opened YouTube and thought “omg an episode of unhhhh I haven’t seen already!” Come to realize it was posted an hour ago. Where did the week go 😭
LMFAO, I get ppl on my Instagram, "wanna Collab"?
1:53 Trixie: “why is this about me again?” Katya: “well…”
How are you doing?
trixie is looking so good this season omg
Whatever Trixie has done with her makeup today... She looks gorgeous!!
I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS ALL THE TIME
Now i want to see the snatch game with Katya as Wendy Williams
OK there was you in an Usher   uniform then there was a monkey in an Usher uniform and then there was Usher the singer i thought until the conversation just went back to you and the monkey what the hell happened to Usher the singer . Gasp oh no They fired him
Both katya and trixie are literally GLOWING on this episode , i mean they always look fierce but god damn I’m shook they r radiant
You know what's rude? I was watching the Ru Paulls Drag Race introduction of all the new girls that just came out on YouTube the other day, _and somebody in the comment section released the elimination order!!!_ I was *pissed* and I wasn't the only one either. They didn't even add a warning of a spoiler!
i am so so sorry for talking during movies, i only ever do it if there’s not many people in the theater and/or it’s a funny movie. i have adhd and i wasn’t medicated for 22 years!!!!! please forgive me, i no longer go to movie theaters  the one time i got shushed was for laughing at a funny part of a movie that other people were laughing at PLUS i was in the very very front row so i had to pretty much look straight up and the mother fcker WEARING A TR*MP SHIRT behind me did the most OBNOXIOUS “shhhhh”  the look i gave that ugly excuse of a man,,,,,,, i proceeded to talk the rest of the movie and i think i had the right to at this point, this was in 2016 and i’m still annoyed abt it
id love me some Pete...😏😏
i feel like if they were kpop songs trixe would be umpah umpah by red velvet and katya would be nxde by gidle idk
3:10 "Really, you didn't pay for it?" HAH got me!
That white wig is 🤌🏾
i love how katya looks EXACTLY like mileena from mk x/11. cant keep my eyes of off her.
I really love that lip color
Omg my Smile audience was super rude too
imagine being Trixie's neighbor only to be a bitch to her
Katya,... SOOOOO GORGEOUS!
I find it fascinating how Katya comes up with the most disturbing and diabolical ways in which she could hurt someone but yet is such a kind soul. It's always the super nice ones that can be a bit scary on the surface.
katya sounding like the hormone monster at 5:10 😭
Watching this made me realize katya has the same physicality/movemwnt as my mom
I was waiting for Katya to say "You know what's really rude? Constant interruptions..." and then do that to-camera Cheshire smile she does lmao
Woah I'm early CHER I LOVE YOUUUUUU
i LOVE these sorta matching dresses, yall look gorgeous
“You can get your face back at the end of the movie”
The way Katya pointed at Trixie when she said “ugly tax”
if anyone knows about being rude, it's Trixie "I Think We Got It" Mattel
Viagra is still effective if you snort it, it just enters the blood via the mucosal membrane and lungs, thought you'd know this Katya. Lol
This was needed today.
they look so beautiful this episode like damn 4:24
11:14 I drunkenly burped at a pizza place in Denmark at 2am and got scolded by a stranger. Katya is correct per usual
Missed opportunity to have one of the protest signs say "I stand with Green Bean."
the editing this episode was wild
I'm genuinely curious - is Trixie in an open relationship or something? I always get so confused when she talks like she's single lol
2 More! (Party 🎉🥳)
Hot Girl Fever Mary, you caught me. Rude Mary Keep on Rudin' Rudin' down the Rudin' down the piglet flop bottom wiglet riverahhhh! Ok bye, Rude🎃💕
Colaaaaaahb
Katya continues to solidify my sexual fluidity; beautiful  :,)
the cut to the evidence at 2:05 lmao
My dog groaned the exact same time and length as Trixie and Katya doing the uuuhhhnn intro bit and Im fucking crying 🤣🤣
My favorite biological women!
I love how Katya keeps referencing that story about the lady who’s face was ripped off by the monkey. I feel like she’s brought it up a few times lol
6:48 TRUTH
Everyone be like Pete - he seems very nice, hot and cute is an appreciated bonus.
SoAs I was watching Avatar 2 last night, some guy picked up a call and spoke on the phone all night! If he was in my vicinity I was going to grab and throw him out!
Katya throwing out a last second Terrifier reference, gotta love it
It should be illigal to be this early
I love how trixie reused her intro quote 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Should you call yourself an uber?" killed me
I HOPE there is a part 2 to this, because I can talk for hours about this subject. 🙏
Colbert mentioned Trixie and then brought out RuPaul and I was kinda sad😢
"burping in New Delhi; not the same as Denmark" iM ASCENDING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It looks like Katya is finally starting those 35 years of looking stunningly gorgeous!
"If they are not rude they were ugly" I...I gotta go 😭
Katya’s so gorgeous and I’m mad I didn’t get to see her in London 😭
Yall should do a video on impressions since katya's deep west Hollywood gay voice and trixies Cher/Swedish Cher it'd be everything
Is trixie wearing an old outfit again?!
We love some Pete appreciation!
This is one of the funniest episodes I’ve seen omg
katya, i’m once again asking for your hand in marriage 🙏🏼
I’m 10 seconds in and this has to be one of my favourite of Katya’s looks EVER
Rest on my titties drag mamas.
I feel like Katya was being rude today. Being so dismissive and disrespectful. She’s a rude B.
Came here after watching a soccer game I'm whiplashed
Katya you seem ok. It's weird.
Why did this one feel like it only lasted 4 minutes hahahaha. Katya saying how you doing was funny
Wait. I feel like we've seen this before. Or are they literally just having the same conversation over again
Fergie is just Katya from eBay
also trixies jugs have gotten so big! glad her milk's coming in
make an episode about Brazil
Is it just me or have they been staying on topic?
They look so beautiful
You can tell Katya is feeling herself and feelin sexyyyyy <3
I LOVE Katya's look! Stunning!
katya is beyond delectable in this episode woah
WHAT WAS THE CAT
Katya giving us Jeffrey Star realness
How are you doing?
U know what drives me nuts....is when u run into some chick u havnt seen in a while and she gets all excited and jumping up amd down and just being obnoxious....I just don't know how to deal with that.but it's not weird it's just annoying
The Peter roast hahahaha "that when you get really nice?"
love you guys sm you both make my day
“You get your face back after the movie”
HOW ARE YOU DOING
the midwestern "well" *knee slap* is very relatable
The monkey shit was lit!
Am I the only one who thought Katya with her deep voice sounded a bit like Alaska?
That whole trauma dumping thing!! Suicide is serious but you dont need to dump that on your favorite entertainers. I cant imagine how drained that must feel when your just trying to get through a meet and greet.
Tea
Vanderpump said “what about THATPART?”
"That's not an invitation." No matter what you wear and who you are.
The little moments when Trixie interrupted Katya in the middle of her speaking...the side eye... the urge to tell her she's rude right now... hilarious 😂
I had a dream a while ago where I was about to have a sleepover with them but Katya couldn't find her house so we ended up sleeping in a car
Why’s it so on brand Katya to not know she’s channeling Wendy Williams until right before the gig?!
best show ever🌈🤗🎀💖🎀
Honestly... one of the best episodes ever
Sorry, peeewwrs, but theres only 2episodes left until the season is over. Ep. 199 and then "Random". All of us will be rewatching as always til the next season comes around. :(
I need Katya to do a full on wendy williams snatch now
Speaking of Usher and rude… Saw him a few times when I lived in Atlanta… he bumped into a friend of mine at a club and pulled the “You’re in my way, do you know who I am?!” routine…   Saw him at the grocery store wandering around one evening looking to find people that would recognize him… 🤦‍♂️
What is the movie with the cat???
Katya what shoe size do you wear? ‘ cause I need them shoes
This was a GREAT episode lmao
Collab with H3H3! Yesterday on the podcast, they mentioned wanting you on the podcast
Peter is 🔥
What about a man singing the entire nutcracker during the ballet...it was great. Loved it
the last two minutes of this filim when they’re talking about the monkey almost fucking killed me omfg
how are *You* doing
Umm…katya is hot af.
Katya's Fergalicious definition make them boys go CRAZY!
When I saw T&K live 2 girls 2 rows behind me were talking unrelated to the show and after the show 2 other girls in the row behind me called them out and the 2 chatty girls got mad at the two for calling them out!! I hope the girls that called them out see this and feel vindicated.
hi rude
ive developed a habit where i cant study unless i hear these two slags talking
Namaste, om shanti
“I think talking during a movie is on the same level as genocide”   AMEN. SISTER. Finally someone said it.
Omg love this show. Two queens
this has the be the best episode as of recently. the movie theater bit was insane
Not enough random naked Pete.
Petey!  Yabba dabba dooooo
Trixie looks distinctly lemon flavored And I wouldn’t say it was the dress (though that’s part of it) but rather the wig  Which reminds me of a lemon ice
Do one about cosplaying
Wendy Williams: how u doinnnnnnnnnnnn Katya as Wendy williams: how are you doing?
Ya'll need to release these faster. I could edit this shit in half a day.  Lol jk
i work at amc and i fucking love the gaymc and amc jokes they’re so funny
i love trixie's dress because it looks just like lemon meringue pie
what was that… JAMES?
OMG Katy looks like Wendy Williams.
Katya: "they don't have to pay the ugly tax." points at Trixie
Trixie looks so stunning. I want a doll like this ,I want to look like this , I want everyone to look like this.
The eyes that Katya delivered saw my future. So beautiful
Plot twist dog lady is watching 😭😂😂😂 hi dog lady! You’re a betch!!!
I love my moms
That face snatching bit killed me 😂😂😂
peter just served us !!!!!
This was really the repetition episode 😂
Huh, trauma dumping is rude. Never thought of it that way.
Let's just appreciate how STUNNING Katya looks this episode
What's Peter's ig pls?
“When is it funny to be rude?”  When you’re being rude to a Karen
Ran to the bathroom at work.
Miss Katya has been waiting for this callout. 😆
Katya literally gets more beautiful looking every episode omg
crying bc this episode feels like they stayed on topic
Im living for Katya exposing Trixie as being rude 😂
Yeay! Love you ladies!
Wait hasn’t Trixie already used that opening line about the bone structure???
Anyone else get (good) shivers from the bass in Katya's voice?   She's also looking AMAAZINGG!! xoxo
The face snatching comments continue ❤️ Thank God for these women.
ok so the uber thing I completely understand, once I stayed for too long at a friend's house and didn't realize it so now I'm chronically embarrassed
hey nematodes~
8:42   "I think talking at a movie theater is on par with genocide." - Trixie Mattel
STOPPP I SAID IT'S THE CAT ON IMPULSE 😭😭😭
LOL Katya doin a off brand Wendy impersonation. ☠
Yes.......GOD!!!!!!!
this is the one time when they censored out the name of something I knew what it was. they're 100% talking about the movie Smile
Am I the only one finding just now trixie and her boyfriend have an open relationship?
Loved it
Katya Williams for president 🤗
Damnnnn Katya… You confirm that I’m pansexual ever so regularly.
As someone who works at a theater, I related to that whole segment😭🤣
Diversity is good Drag is for adult entertainment.  I literally grew with a beautiful Black drag queen in my house, but she didn't bring me to shows or strip for me.
I hate nothing more than someone who talks during a movie I nearly screamed when y’all brought it up. The last time I went to see a movie in theaters there was a couple talking throughout the whole first hour of the movie so I just left, the theater gave me “sorry” tickets but I told them it wasn’t their fault since there’s not much they can even do in that situation, I’m still mad at that couple though 🙃😂
Katya pointing her fan at Trixie when she said "ugly tax"... noooo
I would LOVE to see Wendy interview these two LMFAO.
Dear god 🙏🙏
when wendy williams talks about the killer she is actually talking about katya
You look specially fish on this episode
I Look like Wendy Williams- Katya Party xnekdbwydimeuei .
To be honest, Katya could step in for Wendy and the show wouldn't miss a beat.  They have the same chaotic energy 😂🤣
So I had a little harassment problem with the police, so a got a nice pantsuit and went to court. Actually everyone in the court was so professional and I had hope that this would get resolved.   And then, while I waited on the hall bench,  the security guard police at the court started talking about me.  They said ohh, I have been in her house, meaning they were part of surveillance of my home, and started discussing my habits.   That really threw off my game again.  I haven't told anyone this I am a queer person. Not asking for help just documentation of our struggles thanks for listening.   District court house Belchertown Massachusetts. The charges were dropped.

When this show ends so will my life
katya pointing on trixie when she says ugly tax lol
Katya's "How are you doing" is more like Joey's fake twin in Friends.
Katya Williams looks like Khloe Kardashian from a few years back.
I'm here for it 🐱

The social divide between the poor and rich has been enclosed. A video has arrived
