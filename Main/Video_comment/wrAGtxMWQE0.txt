Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart it's so cute ❤
4:31 and 4:40 had me rolling on the floor 😂😂😂😂
Clear and easy to understand.
Epic.
Excellent work, thank you.
they were zooted they did not know english at this point lmao
zendaya is so beautiful esp with that hair colour ughhhhhh
So well put together.
Now i would of accepted zendaya more as mj if she looked this 😂

Whoa zendaya has classic mj hair in this interview lol
I’m impressed.
This was well researched.
Love the enthusiasm.
4:54 aww sweetheart ❤
4:41
4:30; 4:41; 5:03; OMG I can't breathe....
If Peter and MJ get back together sometime in the next trilogy, they need to give Zendaya a makeover and have her look like this. I think she should be a singer, since in real life, Zendaya actually sings. And she could make her stage name be Mary Jane Watson. And I also hope that they will bring back Ned and make him Hobgoblin. I expect that to happen by the 6th MCU Spider-Man film.
i took the quiz and i got peter...the description perfectly fits me actually. only difference is i hate math whereas peter loves it😂
Came back to this interview after they started filming Spider-Man in Glasgow. Can't wait for more interviews like this 😂
Tom is so cute when he says "Quizzies" 4:42

Hearing Zendaya Calling Tom Holland sweetheart is something I didn’t know I needed to hear they are so beautiful together and I love it 💜💜💜💜💜💜

They are all adorable!!! They are real people you can tell they are having a good time.  So I took the test after watching this, and I got the same as the awesome Miss Z. We both be Dr. Strange!
Is nobody talking about how Tom called doctor strange a d**k
Spiderman no way home
Zendaya: I don't know, we'll see what happens, my mind is pretty open Jacob: Everyone's pretty lit, so I would like to be anyone Tom: I want Spiderman.
MJ como debería haber aparecido :
BRO DUDE BRUH
Just took the test! It said I’m doctor strange ! Love ya ! 😋😁❤️
Zendaya looks like she has the same haircut as MJ did in spider man into the spider verse
I died a little when Zendaya called Tom sweetheart. They are so freaking cutee ❤️

BUZZ QUEED FIZZ 💀💀💀 GOT EVERYTIME   MAN THEY ALL GOT SPEECH PROBLEMS AND ITS KILLING ME 😭😭😭

The way zendaya said "quizzies"
Amazing to see they mess up words as much as I do
Like how Tom Only change his Accent im Movie
OMG I'M CRYING I LAUGHED SO HARD!!!  Also Zendaya calling Tom "sweetheart" just SENDS me. <3 <3 <3
Tom goes” I’d like to be Spider-Man”
OKAY, but Tom Holland wanting to star in a romantic film with Chris Evans, imagine that gay movie perfection.
Buzz queed fizz im dying
"YoU'rE ExTrA Oil"🤣🤣
Rewatching this now..happy birthday tom and you are so tired in this interview. Awww.
J. Jonah Jameson: PARKER!!!!
I just love the way Zendays laughs. Its so endearing.
I took the test and I got mj
I still can't believe that I didn't notice the wig that Jacob wore like I KNEW HE WAS BALD BUT THE HAIR WAS SO NATURAL I FORGOT HE WAS
4:31 i live for this part 😭
I love quizziezzzzzzzzzzzzzzz !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aha i got peter parker let’s goooooo
Fave 0:58 4:30 5:03
lmaoo i took this quiz and i got MJ i luv herrrr
Pete and Kris 🤣🤣
Who’s Peter?
Lol zendaya and I have the same choices 😂
I like Zendaya's hair in this. I hope we do get to see her with this red hair in the sequel to further go with the fact how she is MJ Watson.  Also, if Kirsten Dunst were in No Way Home and Mary Jane got to meet Michelle, I feel like that would inspired Michelle to dye her hair red. Kind of like how Tom's Peter was inspired by the other versions of himself to make a home made suit at the end of the film.
Tom: aren’t they dating each other now?  Jacob and zendaya: no that’s his mum  Tom: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Zendaya should’ve looked like that in the films. She looks more like MJ
Love them but not Buzfeed
All 3 have such great chemistry!!! But Tom and Z are so cute together!!!
HOW WOULD NO ONE CHOOSE TOM HIDDLESTON AS A ROMCOM CHOICE WHAT
Lolll “Buzz QUIZ Feed” ? 😂
When does she called him sweetheart!!!!
BAHAHAHA EXTRA ✨OIL✨
I love this , the ammount of times they kept messing up what they were trying to say 😂❤️
“Bro BuzzFeed is worse than Gossip Girl” i love jacob  😂
I love Jacobs laugh so much. It’s so friendly! ❤️
I took the quiz…. I GOT NED! LETS GO JACOB
Zendaya called Tom sweetheart
I wish Willem, Alfred, and Jamie did this quiz (instead). I can see Willem and Alfred being a little weirded out by doing this but also enjoying it.
Yoo... I love Jacob. He's so cool and has a sense of humor 🤣
I did the quiz and I am Peter Parker
test
they can’t talk it’s so funny
I did it and got Peter Parker
2:18 I was so disappointed that Tom didn't pick umbrella
i wish i could see zendaya
Here’s Tom Holland messsing up his words lol  0:58 “extra oil”  2:11 “singing ladies”  4:30 “Buzz queed fizz  4:41 “quizzies”
Dr. Aloha has the cure to all kinds of diseases and STD. He helped me cure my Hsv 1&2 permanently just within 7 days. https://youtube.com/channel/UC_YFEEZEr1BxGkNg1d4vqww💜🇺🇸
4:30 was so funny
This quiz was very good
I’m sad no one choose Harry😂
at the question which villian to erase I would pick Mysterio cause that way he wont expose Peter's identity, everyone would still know him and doc ock, electro and green goblin wouldn't come in No way home
They knew damn well what they were doing with that thumbnail
lmaooooooo love these guys
I took the quiz just before watching this and I am happy that I got…    ZENDAYA (MJ)
The most american sentence in a British accent  Hi I'm tom and I play peta
Bro Jacob Batalon's laugh is so infectious. I love it. I could not stop laughing😂😂
I was fun watching Jacob giggling throughout the interview
Tom be tripping tho
Tom and I both got Aunt May ❤️
Tom not picking umbrella hurt inside
4:49 they didn’t even need to publicly announce they were together, these 4 seconds says it it all.
Ig we know they are a bit drunk🤣🤣🤣
I took the quiz and I got the same as Tom!
"telling me you're tired without telling me tired"
4:54 “Oh sweetheart” 💗🥺
I also got May as my person. The only thing I'll ever have in a common with Tom Holland.
3:43 and i am also dead (sorry lol)
yess i got peter :)
They can’t break this trio up.
Zen is a GONE GIRLLLL
Its funny how actors seem to trip over their words the most and they talk for a living. 😂
Well I want to get interviewed by buzzfeed so I can get the computer
Buzz qeed fizz
SPREAD THE GOSPEL JESUS LOVES YOU SO MUCH ❤

1:32 we remember it all too well
i love how they say it like BUZZ-FEED-QUIZ
😂😂😂
the thumbnail 👌
OH MY GOD POOR BABIES ARE SOOO EXHAUSTED 😂😂😂  Especially Tom
I have issues at times reading things incorrectly and it makes my family really crack up.  Sometimes I feel real insecure about it, so thanks Tom H, you show me to take it with laughter and just enjoy life/friendships. ***And, I at 4:52 when Zendaya says "Oh Sweetheart" in a very loving and supportive way...knowing it is just who he is and she loves him for it.
The way tom says quizzies lol
i got mj and i can’t explain to you how accurate that is 😭
Ayy @buzzfeed can we get a line of t shirts saying "Buzz Queed Fizz"?

Anybody else notice how they have the Same clothes in the Wired video🤔
Just noticing she called him sweetheart
No one gonna talk ab the fact that tom thought kris and pete were dating 💀
um if your not dating  you should you two match together you guys could get married
No shyt? You can take them mac books?
Zendaya looks amazing with red hair. Now that is MJ!
Did anyone else notice it says "quite" night instead of "quiet" night?
The fact Tom Holland didn’t pick umbrella by Rihanna is infuriating.  He literally sang that… at karaoke 😂🤦‍♀️
what is jacobs obsession with gossip girl in this video LMFAOOO
I got Tom Holland lip sync battle flashbacks when they mentioned umbrella ☂
Unchartered rolled this film big time! And ewww that sweater has to burn! YuukkkkKKKKKK
I got  Ned Leeds Your personality matches Ned. You're funny, cunning, and trustworthy. Like Ned, you're someone who doesn't take life too seriously. You love to have a good time, especially when it's with your closest friends. You love a good adventure, and people often turn to you when they need cheering up.
I got Tom Holland🥰
can we talk about how cute zendaya and tom looked when she called him "sweetheart" (4:53)
2:15 😩❤️
This is why they are my favorite friend group
and i am zendaya PLAY MJAY
CEO of sex is more oil
does anybody notice that zendaya's hair looks like the comic accurate version of MJ?
This video is my safe place now.
If Tom didn't get Spider-Man, May would make the next best sense since they're related (in the franchise).
Them making fun of Tom as a joke haha
Tom: wHaT iS WrOnG WiTh Us
I got happy ><
I did this quiz and it got mj i am so happy
they're so high lmao
Im kinda confused about jacob's hair. Did he go bald after the movie, or is he must wearing a wig inlthe movies? Does he have some desease that makes him lose his hair, or is it just a fashion choice?
Why didn’t Tom choose Umbrella? His LSB is iconic 🌂🌂☔️
The way Tom Holland says quizizz sounded like my school teachers
I am a Scorpio  ♏
I got tom Holland😂
comfort interview
the way nobody realised tom said "buzzquiz feeds" at 5:20
I got Ned Leeds hahaha! ❤️❤️
Zendaya unapologetically being like *team swift* "Jake's gotta go"
5:03 Are they dating each other? No, that’s her mom *starts laughing 😂
I've got Peter Parker <3
Can we appreciate that Tom didn't want to choose between Tobey or Andrew
Lol i guess im MJ
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 💗
I keep coming back to the zodiac sign part lol! Too funny!
Free laptop yay! 😄
BUZZ QUEEN FIZZ

I was so elated when he didn't know the Kardashians that well.
"Tom is zooted my guys"  amazing
I got Peter Parker hahaha
JACOB IS SO FRIGGIN CUTE
I watched this too much times I love them😂😂
Okay as much as I LOVE ❤️ Tom and Zendaya being to gather it what kind of mean they blocked Jacob out of the Thumbnail . I don’t know am I the only one?
Is it just me or is this trio THIS generation's Harry, Ron and Hermione?
4:53 Zendaya calls Tom sweetheart . You can hear it if you listen carefully
Zendaya looks like Mary Jane in this video why couldn’t the MCU make her Mary Jane she looks the part.
I just noticed Tom picked Chris Evans to star in a rom com with but in a previous interview awhile ago, he mentioned that Elizabeth Olsen was hot. So that's cute.
You know what? Tom's hairstyle is changed that's looking good but I like the previous one that was really 👍good.
I have got to see this movie.     Shout out to the cast members🕷🕸
WHAT THE FU- WHAT THE HELL HAPPEND TO TOM'S HAIR AND ZENDAYA'S HAIR WHAT THE F*^%*NG HELL
"your heart is often what guides your decision". *flashback to tom not choosing mysterio cuz it's jake*  me: 100% accurate af
I did the quiz to and i was PETER PARKER!!!!!
i got peter parker haha
is no one gonna talk about how accurate their descriptions were
this is probably my favourite interview ever. they are all so funny i love them a lot
Buzz feed is worse than gossip girls 😂😂😂 2:44
Tom and Zendaya's hair omg
I love the three of them together
none of them can speak properly today lol
i honestly think that they were drunk for this quiz and Tom's British was showing with that song choice
i keep replaying the part from buzz queed fizz and quizzees and i keep laughing everytime idkw 🤣
Them mispronouncing words is the funniest thing ever 😂😂
Why didn’t Tom take umbrella??!!! Hahah dying 😂😂😂
Buzz queef 😂
I'm Peter Parker (Tom holland) P.S. Tom Holland is the best!
I shall now be calling quizzes by qUizZies
I like how Tom didn’t choose ‘Umbrella by Rihanna’  🙄 Lip Sync Battle
I thought he said “I am Tom I play pizza”
BEY
What a precious trio LOL
zendaya calls tom 'sweetheart' at 4:53 if anyone was searching like me, such a cute couplee
Not me coming back to this video again most the views are probably me 😅
Now zendaya really looks like comic book accurate MJ...
Him: I’m not gonna. Chose between Toby or Andrew his mind 💭Andrew Andrew someone get Andrew💭
Tom wanting to do another one 💀💀💀

“ can we do another bUzZ QuEeD fIzZ?” Omg
The fact that Tom is May and Jacob is Happy 👍 Btw I did the quizz before watching the video, I got ant May too, my lady 💕
Zendaya is mary jane to a T in this
When he says what’s wrong with us he said in a low voice “what’s wrong with us baes” in his accent then Zendaya says “oh sweetheart”
i love toms accent
i was so surprise yet happy at the same time that 'The Boys' is Tom's favourite show because that's my favourite too!
It doesn't matter how much you force NPC Holland onto the public, he will never be a convincing nerd, which is an essential trait of Spiderman.
you just know they wanted to erase Green goblin but could not say it
4:54 I love the way she says that
These interviews make much more sense after watching the movie haha
Actually kris jenner is not Pete davidsons mom
4:45  Tom's face: please end my suffering
Zendaya looks like comics MJ here.
4:35 the way Zendaya tries to reach for Tom when he makes a mistake makes me keep believing in love
Her hair seems so mary jane in the comics like redhead
I LOVE THEM  DID ANYONE RELIZE THAT HIM AND ZENDAYA WERE FLIRTING WHEN HE SAYS BUZZ QUEED FIZZ SHE SAYS AWW AND HUGS HIM AND WHEN HE SAYS QUIZEES  ZENDAYA HOLDS HIS HAND AND SAYS SWEETHEART !!!!!
Lol they are so sweet 💙
I took the quiz and got MJ!

Their English was just not it that day 🤣
Spiderman4 the movie Tom

I am such a big fan of Spider-Man and I think spider man 4 could be getting their merories back
i did the test and got peter!!!
tom and zendaya better take back what they said about jake jiggle balls
She has got the same hairstyle as mj In the comics (MARY JANE WATSON NOT MITCHELL JONES WATSON)
JACOB CHOOSING FELLOW ASIAN, SIMU!!! YAAAAAAS!!!

They should do the quiz for which mcu spider man actor of actress are they and it would be funny if they weren’t themselves
Haha I love these 3! I took the quiz and I got MJ <33
Love this trio sm
4:30 "Can we do another Buzz queed fizz"?? - Tom Holland 2021
I forgot Tom was British and his accent scared me
They're ao cute!
i got MJ!!!!
Buzz Queed Fizz 4:30
Why Tom seems smarter with glasses?
I’m just disappointed Tom didn’t pick umbrella as a karaoke song he’d sing
I GOT PETER PARKER
Jacob has lost so much weight, WOW, that's really good for him and I'm happy for him!
“Buss quid fizz” “Singing ladies” “You’re extra oil” 😂😂😂
I got Peter Parker 😁😁😁
they are so stoned and I love it
The way Tom licks his lips at Zendaya at 5:24 😅😂🤣
y'all can say anything about Tomdaya, and I ship them to hardcore, BUT WHEN THEY ALL LAUGH IN UNISON I WANT THAT FRIENDSHIP
I can’t with Tom and his accent with the mispronouncing. Also for the song one for karaoke I have to pick Come On Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners and but when Tom picked it , I was like “ We gotta have the same taste in music or something !! “ 🤭🤭💕💕😂😂
Tom: I want too be spider man once I’m never spider man                   Zendaya and Jacob: wth dude
I loved how Zendaya called tom sweetheart it made smile loL.
Jacob's head look so much smaller than older one
I took the quiz! I am Peter Parker
I got peter Parker
here you're watching the 3 protagonists of one of the most famous movies of MCU not being able to talk for 6 mins straight
🦔
👅
God loves you 💗
im just glad to know tom still loves jake
Btw I’m British so I can explain. When a British person is calling someone Sweetheart or sweetie, it means just calling them love or like friend. Yw!
I'm dying! It's so funny how all of them ended up saying words incorrectly! They're so fun! Love it
I would obviously pick JJJ
I love how Tom didn't wanna choose Mysterio just because of Jake lol
2:17 i hoped tom will choose Umbrella((
Zendaya looks like the original MJ in the comic book with her red hair
1:19 Asian pride yes
buzz qeed fizz
Give my man Jacob some shampoo 💀
i really wish tom picked umbrella for the karaoke for lip sync reasons😂
She says Oh sweetheart to tom
I got Mj hehe
Tom: water melon sugar  Ahh
This is how I am when I haven't been getting a lot of sleep.
i'd describe jacob as "bald"
I want Peter Parker and Zendaya to come to mount isa
imma need these three to listen to all too well 10 minute version right fucking now
what's wrong with US
buzz queed fizz is the best
WHEN TOM SAID QUIZZEES ZENDAYA SAID "aww sweetheart" WHAT
i got ned
I did the quiz and got Peter Parker! Your personality matches Peter Parker. You're ambitious, nerdy, and compassionate. Like Peter, you're someone who often puts the needs of others above your own. You want to make sure everyone feels included and you love surrounding yourself with a close-knit group of friends. You want to make this world a better place.
They are obviously tired! In Germany we say “Nach müde kommt doof” what actually means “after tired comes dumb” and that means when you are very tired and you had no chance for a nap, you’ll talk nonsense at some point. 😅
Tom: Can we do another buzz queed fizz I love how Tom is so funny and he acts like the child of the group. It is cool and so cute
I got the same as Zendaya Dr. Strange
I took the quiz they did and i'm Peter Parker
2:43 "BuzzFeed is worse than Gossip Girl" ded 💀
I did the quiz and i got mj!
lmao i got MJ
TOM I’m very disappointed in you you should have chosen umbrella shoutout to your lip sync battle 😂😂
Tom is a gem lmfaooo
NOOO HE SHOULD’VE DONE UMBRELLA SINCE HEEE DANCED TO IT LMFAO
Extra oil 🤣
we do NOT love jake gyllenhaal for the record
Tom should’ve picked umbrella
Tom's laugh at the end please I'm so in love with him
theyre high you cant convince me otherwise
that was so funny man i love this trio
Flashbacks to Tom dancing to umbrella*
Ha, I also said JJ
I did not realize that Ned is bald
I cannot believe I said adaptation as adaption the same as Zendaya did
Tom got Aunt may….. So he’s dead.
I got peter parker on this quiz! HAHA i got what tom wants
It's funny how they always put everyone but zendeya's last name in the title 😂
Best Trio ever
Surprised Tom didn’t pick umbrella 😭
Your extra oil😂😂🤣
So jacob was always bald-
Zendaya has a beautiful smile, so prettyyy
I like quizzies
4:53 when zendaya calls Tom sweetheart👌
not tom mistakenly thinking that pete and kris are dating i can't😂😂🤣🤣
they are so high lmao...
ॐॐॐ
I did the same quiz and I got mj!
Ok I’m sorry I was peeing my pants laugh I started to cry why was this legit funny 😆😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Imfeek like they are a couple
I GOT MJ🥳🥳🥳
The disappointment that Tom didn't pick Umbrella for his karaoke song
COCKA DODADO
Alternate title: Spiderman Cast struggling with English for 5 mins and 56 seconds
The fact that they cut out Jacob from the thumbnail is sad and what’s even more concerning is that nobody’s noticing 😭

Plot twist: Zendaya got rid of Mysterio cause she’s a swiftie
So they did the wired and BuzzFeed interview on the same day?
Let’s go Asian Pride
Zendaya called him sweetheart and held his hand and put her head on his shoulder…I’m gonna die
I got Peter
Crew!
Zendaya, next year in 2022 I will be talking to a Hollywood Ctew about a remake of the Aaliyah Houghton story. If it goes through , baby would you  be willing to play Aaliyah if someone approach you and ask you? I know personally that you are " Black" enough! Love you! Stay sweet!
I love how match their energies are, look at how they all got slipping tongues in one interview 😂

The three of them never fail to make me laugh!
So let's do a Buzz queed Fizz again for our tom.. ---'Tom is really zoOoted guyz'---

Tom: "Can we do another Buzz Queed Fizz"  Also Tom: It was at this moment that he knew, he fucked up.
the way all three of them just keeps getting the pronunciation wrong IM CRYING HELP
I did the quiz an got spiderman Peter Holland
what have we learned? the spiderman cast cannot read or speak very well
If buzzfeed doesnt make a channel named buzzqueedfizz i dont what will
why is he talking like that?
This is everything.
They did good with the thumbnail 👏
i did the quiz and i got peter  LMAO
they are all three such trolls and i am so here for it
the way tom says sagittarius at the end kills me it's so funny
I just watched spider man no way home and it is the saddest movie ever 😭
Jacobs laugh makes this 10x better🤣🤣😭😭😭
Whoever chose the thumbnail knew what they were doing
So basically Tom Holland is dead???
i got mj 😭
they look really cute 4:50
Zendaya is so cute!
2:49 "With great power comes great curiosity."
So fun and cute
4:29 Buzz queed fizz
I was rlly hoping Tom was gonna pick umbrella 😭😭
chubby boy plays the constant shadow lights to the lovebirds 🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t know that zendaya calling Tom sweetheart would be this emotional
5 minutes of tom, zendaya, and jacob not knowing how to read and pronounce anything 😭
Buzzfeed knew what they were doin w that thumbnail😭😭
"bro tom is zooted my guy SHEESHH"
Jacob and Tom messing up their words every 5 seconds
“Tom is ZOOTED my guy” KILLED ME OML 😭😭😭
4:54 my legit favorite line
If someone doesn’t give Tom his Buzz Queed Fizz, I’m throwing hands.
tom choosing come on eileen like a true brit
I'm Peter Parker 😎
This trio will forever be my favorite <3
Like I just smoked and I swear to god this whole interview they were zooted😹😹😹
Everyone just cannot talk in this video, which I love because I can't either.
is this the last spiderman
His laugh after he said are they dating 🥰
1:39 I agree with Zendaya Mysterio dose have to go because he still has the scarf 🧣
I got MJ
I took this and got Peter Parker, huzzah. Also, I can watch these three all day - Captain America, probably.
I wish zen days had that hair in the spiderman movies, looks more MJ
Tom Holland says everything wrong in interview and everyone loves it.  I say one thing wrong and everyone attacks me. Lol. Love them so much.😍
"are they dating each other now?" I wheezed-
I love no way home
Praise God! God Bless!🎄
They been saying the wrong words from the starting🤣🤣 Tom- "extra oil", "singing ladies", "buzz quees fizz", "quizzes" Ned- "adaption", "pasonality" tom- "what is wrong with us?"...."I like quizzes"😂😂😂😂 "QUIZZIESS WITH MY BESTIES ON BUZZ QUIZ FIZZ"
"Aren't they dating" I meannnnn okk Tom
Zendaya's entire torso is smaller than big people's thighs. She is so skinny
Aw sweetheart  You're an idiot.   They killed me 😭
I’m MJ
2:49 I have alot of respect for Tom Holland now. The Boys is a Savage TV series
they knew exactly what they were doing with the thumbnail
nobody: tom: watermelon sugar ~🤸‍♀high🤸‍♀~ by harry styles
I'm gonna go take that *BuzzQueed Fizz* and some other *quizees*
I didn't even know his name is Jacob. I just thought he was Ned.
conversations you have after that thanksgiving "walk"
yess
Tom Holland: Can we do another Buzz Queed Fizz? Go to Quizeez 1 like = 1 dollar for sad Tom 🤣🤣
Who’s Peter
https://youtu.be/hpMoV0VOlt4
My question is, Buzzfeed gives away free laptops???
ik my fist tatto tendaya lol
I just want to watch this video over and over again. 🤣 You know you’re in a safe space when you start tongue twisting and fearing no judgement. Just pure good vibes. Love it. Just like me and my besties.
With that Red Hair, Zendaya could definitely pull off a Mary Jane  variant of MJ.
I took the test and i got Peter Parker!!!!!!
Eu jurei q ele tinha falado Pizza ao invés de Peter no começo, kakakak
We love Jake ARE YOU SUREEEE
buzz queed fizz lollll
ok when he said i dont know him all to well it wouldve been funny as heel f he said jake gylennhal
The best interviews are from these 3!😁
the millennial came out hard when they got sidetracked and did another unrelated quiz
1:45 Zendaya: "We have to take our emotions out of it!"  Gets doctor strange
“Buzz Quid Feez.” -Tom Holland.
I found this quiz and I took it and got Peter Parker
I love how Jacob is just himself
tom thinking pete davidson and kris jenner are dating has me DYING
This trio is godly
imagine getting set for a buzz feed interview everyone hates buzz quiz’s
i love them so much
no one: tom and jacob: * make a mistake when speaking in some parts of the video *
Hello from England
I really hope Zendaya comes back as MJ looking like that in the next trilogy to really build on that Jones-Watson thing that they said in the movie. Also the other thing is the way she quickly corrects Norman when he asks “Mary Jane?” And she replies “Michelle Jones actually” (or something like that). I think they’re really trying to establish her as Mary Jane Watson after all so I hope she looks the part too (literally just has to do her hair like this video and it’s perfect)
His little laugh when they say "that's his mum"
Jacob selecting umbrella academy because of Benedict Wong is so funny to me because the man isn’t even in that show
Tom knows about the toxic Spiderman Fanbase 😅 2:36
I know it's obvious but I kinda want Zendaya to have this look for the next Spider-man Trilogy since it's comic accurate   2:36
i just know zendaya died of cuteness when tom said "buzz queed fizes" and "quiziz"
High dollar poor acted trash pile.
Took the quiz right before watching & got Aunt May <3
Is no one gonna talk about how the way Zendaya’s hair is in this video makes her look more like a comic-accurate MJ?
4:30 AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
2:45 Zendaya knows what's up
They act like me and my friends on late night study sessions where no one's braincells r working so everything and everyone is just so fucking hilarious
This video is honestly gold. 🤣
HUGE SPOILER PLS DONT CLICK IF YOU HAVENT SEEN NWH.    the fact that tom got aunt may makes her death scene so much more sadder..
Were they on sum this video 😂
4:53 It's all you need on life
I love this they all so cute ☺️
Seeing all these couples , it must be niceeee , im trying be like YOU my boyyyyy
5:07 Toms laugh had me dying 😂🤣
💘
Extra oil lol
Tom and Zendaya: chuckling and embracing each other.  Jacob: quietly dying of laughter not being acknowledged.
As much as I aggressively stan Tomdaya, how dare y’all not even put my boy Jacob in the damn thumbnail?? The disrespect!
zendaya: my mind is open jacob: everyone in the movie is pretty good tom: *I would like to be spiderman*
i’m surprised the title of this isn’t “buzz queed fizz” 🤷🏽‍♀️
“Buzz Qeed Fizz” -Tom Holland
スパイダーマン魂を滾らせろー！！！！(･ω･)つ💖⊂(･ω･)
Tom: you need to go back to school They all kinda need to go back to school to be honest lol
hello there, i dont mean to force my religion on you at all. but Jesus is the messiah. he is the lord and savior of the world. please turn to him and repent from your sins! let's worship the Lord together!! Amen! Glory to the Lord almighty
so who took the test, and what they got? i was mj😎
buzz queed fizz just made my day 😂😂
4:43 is just to cute when Zendaya puts her head on Toms shoulder and says sweetheart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
she looks cute here
Jacob preparing for hobgoblyn ? )))
Tom saying "Singel" instead of Single, reprogrammed my brain
it should have been me
I can't believe Spiderman, Mary Jane and Kingpin are all in one video! So cool
Buzz queed fizz and quizies is hilarious to me, also Tom looks good in glasses
Who’s Peter?
i love how tom is 25 and STILL LOOK SO YOUNG my mom literally thought he was 17 or so lol
LMAO
I got Peter parker
Just found out Tom's dyslexic so this makes a lot more sense 😂😂😂

"Buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl" ~Jacob Batalon 2021
🤣🤣🤣
AHHHHHH😍 4:54
nobody:  Jacob Batalon: that‘s toxic 🤣
She looks at him so lovingly 🥰
Am I the only one who see the engagement ring 💍
I got so happy when Tom picked "Come on Eileen" for one of the sections for such a stupid and unrelated reason. I was in a musical this year and played a girl named Eileen and people sang me that song in one of the iconic scenes idk just made me so sappy seeing tom's reaction the seeing the song as a option.
This was funny also I just saw no way home tonight it was so good
QUIZZIES HAHAHQHAJA cute :(
Lol so funny

stan zendaya for getting rid of jake
I love how she got perfect comic MJ hair RIGHT AFTER 3 movies.

I see what you did there with the thumbnail.
I just realize that their use the same clothes like in wired

God bless all of u! God loves u! God is by your side! Turn to God for He wants to save u from sin and Hell! Jesus died and came back to life for us!💕 MERRY CHRISTMAS! Jesus is the reason for CHRISTMAS!
1:59 "mahá" that was very deep

From 4:31 to 5:00 is my favorite part of this whole thing 😂
5:07 wtf is this laugh Tom??
1:14 I don't know what it says about which character I am, but catch me SMASHING that Tom Hiddleston button.
Is it me or does Jacob's head look like an egg?
nobody: tom: CaN wE dO aNoThEr BuZz QuEeD fIzZ?

When zendaya called Tom sweetheart is so so cute
the amount of brain cells lost in this video
BUZZ QUEED FIZZ😂😂😂😂

AYO why’d you crop out my boy jacob in the thumbnail⁉️⁉️🤨
When Tom Holland didn’t choose umbrella my heart broke

Jacob is me in this.  like "Bro, Tom is zooted my guy, SHEEEEE" I would totally say that.
BuzzFeed quiz
He looks like an intellectual with these glasses

No one’s going to mention the fact that Tom didn’t pick umbrella?
4:53
4:30 THIS PART GETS ME EVERYTIME😭😂🥺
"Happy Hoagie" Z says
That man is an IMPOSTER
i wish you guys put jacob in the thumbnail too honestly disappointing
Zendaya looks like MJ from the comics in this video
They are all wrong we do not like Jake. Anyways, stream Red (Taylor's Version)

No Zendaya, we don’t love jake.
Hi friends, I’m here to let you know that Jesus Christ loves you all and he will protect you and will take care of you. His second coming is near as we have seen many signs of the world end. So, please repent, take baptism and receive the Gift of Holy Spirit, so that you can have eternal life in Heaven instead of being pushed over to eternal fire in hell. The choice is yours. I’m praying for you all that, let God give you strength and courage to overcome the tragedies. Let us all meet together in God’s Great Paradise.   Luke 1 : 37 “ For nothing will be impossible with God.”  With love  God’s servant 💕

Spiderman no way home left me shook it's the best spiderman movie so far
buzz queed fizz
NONE OF THEM CAN SPEAK CORRECTLY LMFAOOOOOO
An old Asian man with Apple genius employee with a Latino chick in a wig.
Bro, Zendaya got that Mary Jane Watson haircut.
jacob saying tom is zooted caught me so off guard but that was funny asf
*It’s funny how Tom and Zendaya are a couple in real life but in the MCU MJ has no memory of Peter.*
4:41 that's the most adorable thing I've ever seen
4:45 idk why but zendaya calling tom “sweetheart” makes me happy-
peter is nice
How tf does Spider-Man beat DR strange in a fight in the new movie
why give free macbook to millionares lol
I love Tom Holland’s accent 😂😂
hahaha i love harry poter
I would like to see the spider guy in season 4, that would be fucking Diabolical!😎
It’s the new stooges‼️😂
I think Jacob has been traumatized by gossip girl….
Yesssss he knows come on Eileen!
I watched the new spider man movie! it's amazing one of my favroite movies!
The accent!!!!!
"Buzz Queed Fizz" had me dying LMAO I love them, they are so funny!
4:52 SHE CALLED HIM SWEETHEART OML THATS THE CUTEST THING
I got Peter Parker lol  Peter Parker Your personality matches Peter Parker. You're ambitious, nerdy, and compassionate. Like Peter, you're someone who often puts the needs of others above your own. You want to make sure everyone feels included and you love surrounding yourself with a close-knit group of friends. You want to make this world a better place.
The reason these three are so believable in the movies is because they're actually friends in real life. You gotta love stuff like this, man.
beautiful friends 😄😊🤗
I loved it!!
Buzz Queed Fizz - Tom Holland 2021 😂
Zendeyya looking like comic book accurate MJ and I’m all for it
Zendaya acts more like MJ than when she’s actually playing MU
I GOT PETER!!!!!!!!!!! LEZ GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! THX TO TOM HOLLAND, ZENDAYA AND JACOB FOR DOING THIS QUIZ WITH ME OR VICA VERSA!
What  No Tom go back to ur old haircut soooooo much nicer my guy U too Zendaya
So… why does Zendaya have perfect MJ hair in a Buzzfeed interview and not the movies where she literally plays MJ???😂
Zendaya keeps dyeing her hair red and Jon Watts still won't let her have it for the film
I liked the video. But dislike nonetheless because of the thumbnail.
How did Tom not choose Umbrella as karaoke song 🙃
thet ALL chose same gender partners to star in a rom-com with im SCREAMING
"Sweetheart" I CAN NOT
the way tom says Sagittarius at the end is so funny to me
i love their friendship so much
“Watermelon sugar haaa~~”
Is this the last movie of spider  man
But Quincy’s feedstock

Jacob talking about gossip girl constantly is my mood
“My face is on this one, so I’m gonna click” 🤣

I love that they all got so excited about keeping the laptops as if they aren't rich as
Loving the tomdaya content. Z called him sweetheart HWBBADSAB IM SCREAMOIIIBGG. Person who put thubnail give him raise. Hes the reason i clicked.
nobody: Tom Holland:Buzz Queed Fizz 4:30
So I did get Peter parker
Love getting to watch all the promo interviews after finally getting to see it, bless
Zendaya should've kept her hair like that in the movie
Tom staying true and loyal to his  movie Brothers and not picking neither of their movies to binge watch tonight. He is so Sweet😊😊😊❤❤❤🕷🕷🕷
Things that no one has talked about that I feel like need to be appreciated: - The amount of times that Jacob mentions Gossip Girl in this video (and during the whole press tour) - A Zendaya & Tessa Thompson Rom-Com. Hollywood, can you make this happen please? - Tom saying "I need to read a book"
Tom’s dyslexia kept kickin in😂😂😂
U are loved by God And he cares about u so much and wants u to turn to him today so that he can make miracles and Blessings happen? God loves u and the world so much that He sent his only son Jesus Christ to Die on the cross so that we could Have a relationship with him and not have to sacrifice anything and we can inherit Heaven and be forgiven for our sins and repent those sins? God has a plan for u and wants it to happen turn to him and he’ll change ur life in a better way than u could ever imagine He’s helped me with many things and will do the same to u Just turn to Him and he will give u rest and will protect u Because he wants to save u and give you his kingdom of Heaven because He loves and cares about u and died for u so that u wouldn’t have to go to Hell. God bless you and have a good Day❤️✝️🙏Accept Jesus as your lord and savior and be saved repent ur sins But it’s ur choice to make but Jesus is coming soon but it’s all ur choice to make God bless
I want an extended version. C'mon Buzzfeed you gotta have more footage of these three!
): why does tom have to be so boring!
*BUZZ QUEED FIZZ*
NAH WE DONT STAN JAKE
Sounds like they’ve been taking a few “puffs” in between takes
They are higher than a kite
Hands down funniest buzz feed video I’ve ever watched 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
me: is it even a question bye jake
That was so wholesome 😂😂😂🥰
lol
spider man is the best superhero
confirmed Zendaya is swiftie Tom is not, I just saw him defend Jake Gyllenhaal with his whole chest
The red hair The red hair
Buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl.
Tom is so charming, how could anyone not love him
I love that they’re adults but they suddenly forgot how to read in the video🤣🤪🤭😂
awwwee!!!
2:42 Most underrated comment lol, Jacob is so funny.
Holland and zendaya are dating I think
Gente como a gente.
And may dies
Love Zendaya’s hair here. Kinda reminds me of MJ. Really cool
After watching this interview I ft my cousin and we did buzz feed quizzes together. I said “quezies” and started dying of laughter, then I had to explain why i thought it was so funny but she was confused 💀😭
Buzz queed fizz😭😭
Her hair looks like mjs from the comics
The part when Tom confuses Kim and kris is the funniest thing ever 😂
The person who chose the thumbnail OMG
why no one talkin about the fact that they’re high asf in this video 🤣
i’m surprised tom didn’t choose umbrella
tom doesn’t seem zooted at all lmao this just him
4:30 - on from there, it is the real Tom. So brilliant love it!
We need these three in another movie together outside of the MCU. Maybe a comedy or a romcom!
Tom was buzzed on BuzzFeed
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16.  Jesus loves you. If you wish to Surrender your life to Jesus Christ. Please repeat this...My Lord Jesus...I am a sinner...I come to you today... I confess my sins and I repent of them all. Please accept me as your son/daughter....wash me with your blood...I confess you as my Lord and personal saviour ... In Jesus name. Amen Welcome into God's family!
this kids need to go back to school
She went from sweetheart to idiot lol
I don't know him ALL THAT WELL I understood the reference 😭😭
Tom getting Mae and Jacob getting Happy and they didnt make a soulmate joke?
OMG SHE CALLED HIM SWEETHEAART AAAAAA 💗💗💗💗💗💗
I got Peter Parker lol
I got spiderman/peterparker i beat tom
You're extra oil😂😂😂
These three and Jacobs gf would be such a cool group to hangout with I love them sm :(
Tom- “DONT GET RID OF JAKE!”  Lol the bromance Edit-  “Can we do another buzz queed fizz?” Omg I love him so much
The best trio ever
When tom was like “oh my god” 😂😂😂
Buzz queed fizz 😆
so toms stoned right
They must be teird from doing so much press 😭😭
why are they so cute???
I got mj and it’s matches me perfectly
JESUS IS KING GOD IS THE GREATEST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT IS POWERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE MIGHTY NAME OF JESUS AMEN ✝️💕❤️💖😍🙏👑
DID NO ONE CATCH THAT AT THE END HE SAID BUZZ QUIZ FEEDS😂😂💀
god😆😆
Third wheeling in film and reality, my boy must be dying inside
I think they all had edibles before this interview, lmao. Cute.😂
"cause I don't know him 'all that well'"
If the camera puts on 10 pounds, Zendaya must be a literal skeleton in person.
“Can we another Buzz Queed Fizz?” -Tom Holland 2021  “Quizzeez” -Also Tom Holland
Jacob: "Buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl'  I mean.....is he wrong?
"quite" night?
That thumbnail seems like a lot more Tom and Zendaya than Jacob.
all of their messing up made my brain hurt
You can tell they are exhausted
Everything that happened after the quiz is hilarious xD
Rip to may 😭
PLS THIS VIDEO IS HILARIOUS
I LOVE EM
MJ is actually Michael Jordon
Total moooooood
I just did the quiz and I got Peter :)
Is Benedict Wong in Umbrella Academy? @2:54
Oh My God... Tom is hilarious AF... Aren't they dating now? ROFL.
I am Peter Parker!!!! I just saw the movie in 4D and it's amazing my absolute favourite movie
Olivia literally got her name spoken out by Tom I’d die if I was her
“She’s her mom” 😭😭😂
haha they were made for their roles, i bet it didnt even feel like acting when they did scenes together :P
“We love jake” what do you mean by that🧐
Can we get Tom & Zendaya to read thirst tweets please
Buzzfeed has some spelling mistakes there with a description (3:54). 👀Then again, a lot of people get confused between "quite" and "quiet".😜
Pov ur a swifty: NO GET RID OF JAKE😭
ah yes, a Buzz queed fuiz
Umm, I’d like to be on Buzz Feed😂! I need a laptop as well🤣
tom looks so much like tom hiddleston here
Poor Tom is tired 😂😂😂
I feel so bad for Jacob lowkey having to be a third wheel...
zendaya does not “love jake” or feels “sorry jake” YOU. CAN. TELL.
the thumbnail tryna get us
Where is Tom’s sweater from?
4:53 she called him a " sweat heart " that's adorable
I love these threes dynamics together, they all bounce off each other really well and genuinely seem close, I hope it stays that way!!! It's great to see on screen friendship turn to true friendship
2:13 is such a trio moment fr xD
I know that the ending of no way home is upsetting so a lot of people. And a lot of us really want another Spider-Man movie where everyone remembers Peter
Spider-man: Back to school
Tom: " ... and I'm only gonna say this because I don't know him all that well but J. Jonah Jameson". Who else thought that this was an all too well reference for Jake 😅
Tom should have chose umbrella considering he lip synced to it so incredibly
Buena entrevista jajaja, hubo mucha naturalidad y además parece que se la pasaron bien y estuvo chido, porque me reí bastante.
1:31 Tom: “I don’t know him all that well” *IS THAT A TAYLOR SWIFT REFERENCE LMAOO*
love you Tom, Zendaya and Jacob <3
3:27 i watched the movie the day it came out the time it came out and ayo- tom’s very rude lmao
Alternate title ‘The cast if Spider-Man not being able to read for 10 minutes’
idk why but they're giving teacher vibes with their outfit. Tom is for arts, Jacob is for literature and Zendaya is for science
them saying they love jake gyllenhaal hurt me
That Jacob's "sheeesh" was so smooth wholesome video❤️
okay, Zendaya really likes Tom Holland
I got Peter Parker
Tom Hollands plays who?
Zendaya's hair looks gorgeous !
Did zendaya just say Tessa?? Ok!!! Here for it
How dare you even suggest removing J. Jonah. Jameson...
I love that they just wanted to keep taking quizzes, and that they weren’t ready to just get out of there like some people who do this
Nobody talking about how zendaya chose to snap jake gyllenhaal out.... 👀👀👀
Have these 3 even slept the last 2 weeks???
BROO THIS IS SO FUNNY🤣🤣🤣
buzzfeed knows what they're doing with that thumbnail
rlly rlly we're doin this...SWEETHEART??
them
Tom picking Chris evans for a rom com is everything to me 💛
we DONT love Jake
“awe sweetheart, quizzies!”
i would describe Jacob as bold
Their energy is giving "refusing to sleep but so tired at a sleepover" vibes
Come on Eileen is an end of night banger.
"CAN WE DO ANOTHER BUZZ QUEED FEEZ?" . **face palms and uncontrollable laughs** . wHat iS wR0nG wiTh Us??😆😆
Buzz Queed Fizz queezes 👌🏻😂
Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart🥰🥰
Zendaya wanted to kiss him when he said Buzz Qeed Fizz lmao. These poor babies are overworked with these press tours.
Zendaya is going full on comics MJ with this look.
This was so hilarious! They all must be really tired because they're taking turns saying everything wrong :P Buzz Quiz Feeds should be the new name going forward.
“Buzzfeed is worse than Gossip Girl” 😂😂😂
I got ned Leeds
I love how Tom is such a Jake Gyllenhaal stan
“Aren’t they dating each other now” Lmfaoooo that was fucking gold😂
jacob choosing simu because of Asian representation/pride is everything
2:44 Jacob: Bro, Buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl.  *Buzzfeed at the end of the video: gives laptops away for FREE.. even to celebs who publicly roast them* 😂
they tripping over their words and giggling to each other, this could only be the signs of sleep deprivation
Wait they get the computers!! Wow!!
“cAn wE Do aNoTHer  BUZZ QEED FIZZ?”   Toms face: 😀what the hell did I say -
fine!
NOT TOM THINKING KRIS JENNER AND PETE DAVIDSON ARE DATING
Am I the only one who doesn’t know that Andrew hates tobey?
The movie is sooo cool I watch it today
I love how Zendaya has red hair just like Mary Jane!
Everyone talking about zendaya and Tom no one gon say anything bout how Jacob said Tom was zooted
he said tom is zooted!?!?! did they smoke some mary jane??!
yall really did my boy Jacob dirty by cropping him out
Yet again a mistake in the end, "BuzzQuizFeed" 😂 lol
They are so in love and I'm so happy for them lol
ZENDAYA GRABBING HIS HAND AND SAYING "OH SWEETHEART" 4:52
Even though I like the video I gotta dislike bc its buzzfeed
they knew what they were doing with the thumbnail
Zendaya wearing that wig looking like the real mj
“we love jake”
when zendaya said she loves jake gyllenhall the swifty in me died a little bit
zendaya staring to see if tom will respond to his jokes
I love them so much
" We love jake" read the fucking room guys
So I can’t possibly be the only one surprised Ned is bald….
The dynamic between those 3 is awesome. Can't help but smile & laugh along with them.
wait, when tom said "i don't know him all that well" my mind went straight to taylor swift.
I KNOW YOU GUYS HEARD THAT “oh sweetheart”
Ethel just dont look like a couple 😭😫… at all
Why does zendaya look like daphne from scooby-doo...
Tom's laugh at 5:07 !!!!
People see thumbnail   *click*
ok but i needddd zendaya's outfit
i love tom holland i love zendaya i love jacob i love spidey senses queens and kings my daughter doesnt approve of my obsession but i love to wach these vids everyday when im home alone and bored this is my home and i love eahc and everyone of these guys
NOT TOM MISTAKING KRIS JENNER AND KIM KARDASHIAN💀💀
By far, one of my most favorite interviews of these three.
Zendaya: Oh sweetheart   Tom: blushes
Hiii how are you
i have a question tho who is peter??
Tom Holland is a lucky guy.
I got Peter Parker
I love their friendship
Alternative Title: Spider-Man No Way Home cast corrects each others pronunciation for 5 minutes straight
Why does she look exactly like comics mj ONLY offscreen
i did it and got peter parker lol
*Guys get some sleep* 😂
Never heard so many stutters and mix up of words ever 😂😂😂
AHHH TOM WATCHES THE BOYSS
I took the quiz and I got MJ <3 they're all so adorable haha
Buzz Queed Fizz got me rolling on the floor
Buzz Queed Fizz
i got spidermannnn
Obsessed with Tom's accent
Zendays is a queen👑
I love them so much
tomdaya is the best thing fight me
If they break up the whole world is going to feel it after seeing all these pda interviews. So please love each other forever Tom & Zendaya 🙏🏽❤️
It really hurts my hear knowing that this press tour it's gonna be their last together :(
I could have watched this for hours
NOT ME CRYING CAUSE TOM HOLLAND DIDN’T CHOOSE UMBRELLA
Tom after 4:30 is one of the funniest things I’ve seen on the internet in a while 😭
Y’all need a break from speaking English fr 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣
I think for the next spider man movie there should be spider girl and zendaya should be it
It's clear that Tom does not keep up with the Kardashians 😅😂
I was MJ in it :)
Tom, Zendaya and Jacob being dyslexic for 6mins straight 😂
5:07 the most I’ve seen Tom laugh that hard
I'd say they bring the softside out of this Englishman.Awww so sweet,and what a film they were just in.xx
no one gonna talk about how jacob started laughing at 1:30 bc tom said *all that well* and totally thought he was gonna pick jake lmao
i got peter parker 💅
I would like to request Tom reading thirst tweets/comments
they are all so cute lol
I’m actually lmao
“ur an idiot” 😂😂
The video makes it really easy to believe that they’re the kind of friends that l’ll have a sleepover and take a bunch of personality quizzes while watching 90s movies. They have great chemistry together!
the way I wheezed when Tom said buzz queed fizz😂😭😭😭
I love her new hair its so pretty
as a person who has been in love with tom holland since 2017 and a tom and zendaya shipper seeing them together is a mix of jealousy and happiness
The thumbnail choice.. nice😌😏👌🏻
HE CALLED JAMESON GOSSIP GIRL😭
Zendaya erasing Jake  Being on Taylor's side 🥺💗
That thumbnail😏
I love have Jacob said,"Buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl." LMAO
‘we love jake’ taylor swift stans are ripping our hair out rn
this is my fav interview lmao
Their excitment when they realized they got free computers just for being fan bait was actually me. Please my laptop doesn't turn on anymore
Yeah I don't if Strange can be considered super responsible
They were just woozy that day😂😂😂😂 I'm sure it was a busy day
Tom's dyslexic right?
Why is no one talking about how cute Tom's laugh is at around 5:05
I got may Parker 🤍🤍
So glad we have some Umbrella Academy rep here
5 minutes of the cast of spider-man no way home learning how to read
Zendaya's hair looks really pretty in this video
I got Ned Leeds
Buzzfeed, why was the grammar so bad.. quite instead of quiet? Friends' when it should be friends? Are these fanmade?
BUZZ QUEED FIZZ
Nice
0:03 hi i’m tom i play pizza
IM DYING  XUUISHXIS QUIZZIESSSS
Zendaya in this interview looks exactly like Mary Jane in the comics ! It's perfect ! 👌
The way they all messed up reading LMFAOOO True friendship right there
😭❤️
Ned cusses so much. Why?
Zendaya is totally in love with him. I never seen her act like this with someone else 😭😭😭
This should be called 5:56 of them forgetting how to talk 😂
I guess they did this at the end of the day😂
no but I'm actually dying😂
I guess Zendaya is team Taylor after all for getting rid of Jake lol
Did Jacob lose some weight? He looks good!
ur extra oil
2:22 Fiancé 🤣 HAHAHA
Did Zendaya say fiancé instead of Beyonce
Lizzo, what do we reckon.....  SAGITTARIUS
"Oh sweetheart" That is. I died 😍
They just forgot how to read
BuzzFeed is worse than gossip girls 😭😭😭😭
Is no one talking about all the weight Jacob has lost like good for him man 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I wish I acted in this epic film!!!😃😃😃
MCU actor you'd star in a rom-com with Tom, immediately: Chris Evans
😂😂😂🤣
I tried this quiz as well and I got MJ. Yay.....😎
4:53
I thought tom would've chosen Umbrella but their reactions to tom saying buzz Queed Fizz were so funny but adorable but i love the film so much, and cant believe that the journey in Marvel is over.
Zendaya just being swiftie thats why she removes Jake
I got May Parker also-
Aunt may dies
Shoutout to Quizies

"I am tom i play pizza." Why tf did i hear this??!!
The fact that Tom got May Parker is sad….
this interview gave me so much serotonin
This trio is killing me!!! 🤣
tom x zendaya is the best couple
BuzzFeed can afford to give away Apple laptops to major celebrities??? Wow...
bro jacob cool asf it reminds me of my homies hahahaha
They’re stylists for the press tour were EARNING their paycheque
Gotta tip my hat to them. They always get our best!
they're the best celebs to watch due reality tv
what did they drink before this? LOL
Imagine if Taylor Swift asked Tom Holland instead of Dylan O’Brien to be in the All Too Well Short Film…
they’re so chaotic I LOVE THEIR FRIENDSHIP
Wow guys Tom Holland as Spider-Man wouldn’t that be crazy
They all had to be high ain’t no way they can’t read 😭😭😭😭
zendaya holding tom’s hand for a second and calling him sweetie is everything I’ve needed and more.
Tom Holland sounds like Peter Parker doing a bad English accent.
💀💀
Tom getting May hits different now
Zendaya you may be tom’s bf but jakes his HUSBAND
this is my favorite video ever.
Love how they were all laughing at the same time!! Lol
Lover watching the Buzzfeed Quizzies with these besties😁
5 minutes of them being illiterate 😂
These three are so genuine in their friendship and truly like/love each other. They just ooze sincerity!
Somehow, at the beginning of the video, when they were talking about who they wanted to get, I guessed that Tom would get May before knowing the truth, and I am proud of my intuition.
Like how he called doctor strange a dick lmao
Wow how much dyslexia you can see in this vid, I feel identified
The fact that Tom is high xD
I got peter parker and my bff got aunt may🤭
Oh my gosh when Zendaya called Tom sweetheart my heart

Singing ladies
Zendaya calling him “sweetheart” 🥺
This has me smiling so bad bro
I can't the amount of oopsies in this video was so cute

4:50 Tom is zoomed my guy sheeeze 😂😂
Tomdaya is so amazing ☺️🤩 💜
Zendaya literally said swift with her villain choice
Zendaya looks so good
4:52 "Aw sweetheart 😂" love that
Zendaya understands what Mysterio did to the swifties 😤😤😤😤
I realized I'm old now when I had to search up the meaning of "zooted".
I’ll never forget ever
I still remember when she playing on K.C undercover
Zendayas hair here screams original MJ
"Tom is zooted my guy SHHEEEEEESH"
Singing Ladies Adaption Passionality Buzz Queed Fizzes Quizzies 😆
5:07 TOM'S LAUGH THO LMAOOOO
I'm glad they are not too guarded now, especially Zendaya. Whatever they share let's leave it too them.
Jacooooooob 😭😭😂😂 Buzzfeed is more toxic than gossip girl  love it, Jacob's no filter is just ❤
Not Tom thinking Kris was Kim and dating Pete, why isn’t that viral??!
"Buzz quizz feet" tom holland -2021
Zendaya looks more like MJ here than in the movies lmao
Unpopular opinion I know but how does Zendaya looks almost exactly like Mary Jane in real life then in the movie portrayal
Oh boy I imagine it’s been a long day/ week of media appearances 😂
Lizzo is a Taurus ♉💀
Did anyone else want Tom to pick umbrella
I got Peter Parker
Aunt Mae😭😭😭
Tom I will be seeing you soon through marvel Hercules acter
She looks more like MJ here than at any point in the movie!
Put your faith and trust in Jesus.....he is coming very soon.  No politician or government can save you.  What is happening around the world is biblical, and judgement is about to befall Israel and the unrepentant, unbelieving people who continue to reject Jesus.  My hope is that you would come to repentance and call out to your only Lord and saviour!  For the mockers and scoffers......you will remember reading this!  The filthy wickedness of this world is about to end.  Praise God!
I got   MJ Your personality matches MJ. You're sarcastic, smart, and loyal. Like MJ, it takes you a little while to open up to new people, but once you do, you become their friend for life. You're a glass-half-empty kind of person who sometimes needs reminding that good things can happen. Your biggest support system is your best friends
Thank u buzz queed fizz for this quality of a vid :))
Z: “awe sweetheart 😂😭”  im crying
um ... i don't know what this is, but it looks like too much fun :D  When you got that kinda off-camera chemistry, you're bound to make SOMETHING great!
IM DYING they were all over the place and that’s why I love them
The Bible says unless you repent you’ll perish (Luke 13:3)Fornicators,idolaters,drunkards, effeminate,homosexuals,revilers will not inherit God’s Kingdom (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)
I would really like to know why Zendaya character doesn't want to go by Watson?? 🤔
Funny! :p
AS A SWIFTIE WATCHING THEM COMPLEMENT JAKE IS DEATH 😭
Tom saying J Jamison has gotta go in the snap out of all the villains just made me dying 🤣
i matched with peter parker
4:53 AW SWEETHEART
nooo kris jenner and pete 💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂why tom it was thinking😭😭😭😭😭😭
i got peter parker "Your personality matches Peter Parker. You're ambitious, nerdy, and compassionate. Like Peter, you're someone who often puts the needs of others above your own. You want to make sure everyone feels included and you love surrounding yourself with a close-knit group of friends. You want to make this world a better place."
Oh Tom I feel you! When I am super tired my brain do that EXACT same thing when trying to read and it just snowballs and keeps getting worse and worst. What a time lol
Bro looks like an egg
Maaaaan, I wish Jacob was in the thumbnail. I love Tom and Zendaya’s cute relationship but it’s just upsetting that Jacob’s been put to the side as of late 😕
The strange mary connolly supply because match iteratively nail modulo a spiteful pizza. mundane, tiny keyboard
Not the “Buzz Queen Fizz”
Am allowed to rebroadcast this?
The movie was crazy good u guys are awesome
The fact that they all choose another quiz from the suggestions immediately after finishing is the most relatable thing.
three millionaires getting exited over a free computer 🤦🏻‍♀️
5 minutes of finding out that they are illiterate, LOL
Zendaya getting rid of Jake!!!!😁😁😁😁😁
Sad that Tom didn’t go with umbrella. UMBERELLAA ELLA ELLA AY AY AY
BUZZ QUEED FIZZES
this whole video is just them pronouncing words wrong
3:52 they mispelled quiet. Sorry. Had to be that guy
man they were STRUGGLING during this💀
The cast of NWH not being able to read for 5 mins straight 😂
Zendaya being fruity and choosing TESSA YESSSS
jacob is the best <3
The only promo Interview we needed 🔥😂
Why does zendaya look like the iconic mj from spiderman (2002)
Why does zendaya look so comic accurate
Most probably Ned and Mj won't be in spiderman 4. That's just sad
the best one
What’s with the wig though??
oh sweetheart🥺💕
i got may
I think they came to the interview drunk LMAO
i cried my ass off in the end
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
Spoiler alert kinda But I thought in this movie Doctor Strange was the most responsible one and the right one. It was Spiderman being a selfish d*** For most of the movie.
Tom Holland is the new Bella Thorne with that English
Disappointed in Zendaya for saying love you to jake
I’m waiting for the day they include tobey and andrew
Zendya's so pretty.  What's up with Tom's hair? Is he getting ready to play Annie ?
I want whatever they smoked before this interview 😂😂
4:53 that was the warmest “Sweetheart” ever
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates -🎈
Buzzfeed giving away free laptops omg🤣
"I hope they remember you."
For the boies n girls https://youtu.be/sActeCD-t0A
they can take the laptops?🥲
Your Audio is reaaaally quiet
I’m making the thumbnail my screen saver nothing is changing my mind.
Broooo se days literally had the perfect MJ hairstyle in this video
This was so chaotic I NEED MORE
Dyslexia in its full glory
I'm hoping to see them get together for another film after what I've seen
“Aren’t they dating each other now?” Well so Tom is up on the gossip these days lol
The poor man is dyslexic stop making fun of him.
Dont forget Dr.strange..
3 spiderman from 3 multi verse ..it was a great idea for a movie..
Spiderman is an amazing movie..
I love them 😭😭
🤣🤣🤣
I got MJ lol
The love I have for this cast is UNMATCHED they are amazing 😭AHH
HE LOOKS LIKE AN EGG
Jesus Christ guys, we get it, spiderman is coming out. Thousands of videos of these people is annoying as hell. Let's be real, the only reason people are excited for spiderman is because of the OG actors. Who the hell cares about these kids.
I litterly watched the movie the same day they recorded it. It was amazing and it was very sad. The movie theater was crowded. Some new people joined the movie that you might know. Please go watch the movie.
buzzfeed knows what they are doing with that thumbnail
the fact that jacob used the word zoomed makes me like him even more
Tom thinking pete and kris are dating is HILARIOUS
ANYTIME THEY BRING UP ANY SICKO GARBASHAN IT ALL BECOMES GARBAGE. HAVE SOME CLASS PEOPLE.
I see Jacob has been practicing his John Cena impression in the thumbnail  Mans completely invisible
Zendaya is like a mum
this trio is the best at each interview..
Red head Zendaya. Gotta love an actresses dedication to her roll
petah
It’s 12 am and I am smiling at my phone like an idiot . God I love Tom and Zendaya
Stop worshipping celebrities. HOLLYWOOD HATES YOU.
Had to take the quiz after cracking-up to this video and got Peter Parker! Yesss 😎
NO WAY HOME SPOILERS AHEAD      So… is Tom gonna die?
it just escalated at the end ah great
man MJ shouldve look like that in the movies
Who else always calls "MJ" Zendaya like i've never said MJ

Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life578
Choose thia for Peter parker Loyal Elizabeth  Umbrella Green goblin  Dark knight
Watched the movie last night and took the quiz and got peter parker
Y does Tom ALWAYS wear that shirt… or does Zendaya just change for every interview?
Jacob will never turn on Tom and become a super villain.
Id want to be ned's grandmother
did they took the laptops with them?😆
with this video we learned that Tom is bad at grammar!
I GOT PETER PARKER
Pop 0 IP
Z'S Mary Jane WATSON INSPIRED OUTFIT
Nature sounds for sleeping
Tom: I can’t do that to Jake Me: Yes you can
The thumbnail 🥰🥰🥰
Need to comment about Jacob because he is funny as hell and I feel like he is being ignored. The Spider-Man without Ned wouldn’t be the same. I love Zendaya and Tom too, of course.
They're so cute and such a fun bunch.
He doesn't know j jonah jameson😳
Don’t be shy lemme have one of those laptops BuzzFeed 😚
Had to watch an interview to see them interact as friends 😔
Tom should have picked Umbrella as the song since he performed Umbrella 😂
I think I'm gonna go take a Buzz Queed Fizz
Love Zendaya's hair she really look's like MJ now the way she puts her head on Tom love those two.
Watched the movie So fantastic with the three spidermans Really loved it with super villains But I actually didn't love the ending part when Eddie Brock from venom disappeared :(
This press tour is killing their brain cells at an exponential rate 💀💀
Tom we all know you secretly wanted to choose Umbrella by Riri:)
This is the best buzzqueedfizz video out there
Nobody Jacob: Buzzfeed is worse then gossip girl
I love  that Tom with all his money says "we can keep these ?" Omg! Like this us great! Jacob saying Tom is zoomed! Rue would know about that!!
4:50 - picture perfect <3
You can se him struggling whit the twisted words of dyslexia
Tom holland has dyslexia and it’s so nice to see someone else twist words like my dyslexic mind dose
oh wow so they were tired tired
5:21 "Buzz Quiz Feed" Tom saying it all back and forth 😂😂😂😂
Wait, Buzz feed give them the computers home!?!? 🤑
Don't say just MJ, you are not Mary Jane, you are Michelle Jones
Guys you had 1 job! To talk english! :D
Could y'all have not given them a table, Buzzfeed
I really love this video!! thanks BuzzFeed <3
the way Z leaned on Tom's shoulder 🥺🥺
4:30 "BUZZ QUEED FIZZ." 4:41 "QUIZZIES." 5:04 "THAT'S HER MOM." 😂😂😂😂😂

Quizzies 🤣 Buzz QUEED 😅🤣💀
I’m screaming. They’re definitely tired from all the press they’re doing. Bless their souls haha.
I hope they get percentage cuts.
Jacob also swears a lot more  :D
Hilarious but I don't think that bald suits that guy LoL  😆😯
The way they all kept messing up the words has me dying LMAO
I can't get over the "Buzz qeed fizz" 😂🤣
"We have to take our emotions out of it" "No I'm going full emotions" Me vs me 1 second later
Can't believe Tom Holland shares my love for Come On Eileen!
I love Jacob hahaha UwU
4:35 ned sees Z comforting T  4:38 ned cries
I always love seeing multiracial couple. It just in my opinion, if they can maintain the relationship, they will be a hollywood power couple in the future. They will inspire many people, especially young people. How they complete each other, support each other career, know each other character as they've been friends for the past years. With all the things about diversity and inclusivity hollywood always saying. They will be an iconic couple, inspiring.. who says men and women couldn't have great career together equally??? As long as they support each other. I wish tom and z all best and happiness. Tons of lucks for this new young lovebirds, tom and Z.  For Jacob, i always laugh seeing him. He is the funniest one. Jacob is really the bestfriend tom and z could have. This trio is fantastic. I love them so much
Tom's Ricky Gervais' laugh at 5:06 😂
I just watched the movie 😭😭
How you get rid of Jake??!! Taylor must have put her up to it lol...

zendaya looks like a comic accurate MJ
BUZZFEED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH THE THUMBNAIL
amo muito esse casal😍
I think that they are dyslexic lol😂
Is he wearing lipstick?  He looks like a bald overweight woman....
BRUH THEY HAD ME DEAD
Y’all doing the most chill out
Its actually really sad seeing the ending of the movie that these three may never do an interview together ever again.
I already did the test and I had to be MJ
This is one of the funniest and cutest videos I’ve seen. Can’t get enough of this cast
TOM IS ZOOTED MY GUY!!!!
I just like the thumbnail, okay?
So spiderman is f***ing MJ in real life
They may well be nice people, but the movie is awful. Terribly infantile story and character development. It's a representation of everything that is wrong with society at this time. Which is why we are experiencing the current wave of do gooder tyranny. No dialogue, decisions are made based on emotional impulse alone and when the poop hits the proverbial fan, they double down on more poop and more fan speed. No ability reflect, no accountability, complete chaos.
These 3 have a great friendship. Really sweet.
The Asian guy, mixed race lady and white guy all picking people who they can identify with/looks like them 'to star in a rom-com' with. #representationmatters
The fact that they put J. Jonah as a Spider-Man villain is the funniest thing🤣
is anyone else hunting all these spiderman interviews
Can’t get enough of this cast, they’re too sick.
I took that quiz I got Happy Hogan 😎😎😎😎😎
Tom definitely should have chose Umbrella
"I'm going with Chris Evans"  That was a pretty fast answer.
Extra oil 😭😭
NOT ME THINKING HE WAS GOING TO SAY "ALL TOO WELL" AT 1:32
They make me feel single even though I have a boyfriend 💀
i need to know what tom smoked before this interview because my GOD
Are they actually zooted?
"buzz queed fizz" HOLLAND, Thomas, 2021
Zendaye acualy looks like MJ here
I am convinced all 3 of them are high as balls
I watched no way home today and I gotta say Tom and Z are acting way cuter together here than in the movie lol
Now why didn’t Tom choose umbrella 😒😒👏
Her with that mj hair tho. So good
Does anyone realize that Zendaya dyed her hair red? Mary Jane literally has red hair (or ginger hair, I can’t tell the difference). Her character’s name is Michelle Jones-Watson, so the hair should be with the character in the next movie.  Also, Tom Holland likes The Boys? The same series that is parodying superhero movies? I totally didn’t expect that.
Zendaya's hair along with tom's are just so confusing to me here
4:52
I wish they let them do another quiz just so the video can be longer and we can enjoy their chemistry more 😩🤣
They have been on a press tour so they are all probably exhausted  I understand that they are trying to keep professional and personal separate but I like they are more relaxed recently
It's clear to see that Zendaya is team Jake. Is there any Taylor beef I don't know about? I am of course neutral.
She really looks like mj now
4.51 my fucking heart just died
There’s a typo in the May Parker description, it reads “quite” instead of “quiet” in the last line
buzz queed fizz
Tom is my brain during class
do tom and zendeya date ?
I just watched nwh today and i don't wanna spoil anything but that movie's sick
We are patiently waiting for all of them to read their thirst tweets please and thank you
Ok Zendaya with that hair is just Mary Jane can we PLEASE get her with this hair in the movies for now on
This whole interview with the three of them had me cracking up 🤣
Jacob has the best laugh!
Please change it to *Buzz Queed Fizz*
Quix
I got Peter Parker. Watching these interviews eases the pain after the movie
TE  AMO
Buzz queed fizz😂 some things,very interesting/ (thx 🕷) 👍
This was awesome. These guys are funny lol
“mark zuckerberg what do we rank him?”  “sagittarius”  LMFAOOOOO
4:51 oh sweetheart
tom, Zendaya, and Jacob not being able to read or speak
jacob batalon just being a third wheel here be like :
4:49 thats real love right there

Zendaya looks absolutely amazing…
I just watched the movie and its so GOOD like i love how Andrew and Toby came back and the villains!

This is such a PR relationships it's so cringey
This video had me dyingggg 😂😂😂 these three are my absolute favorites!!

The English language is not on their side in this video 😂😂
I love the fact that they are 25 years old but still act like 17 year olds lol 😂😂
https://youtu.be/ww3mTICCaf0
Kinda hope they kill off Ned. How did we go from Peter Parker having the sexy beast James Franco as his best friend to Jacob Batalon. He looks terrible.
aren’t they dating “that’s the mom” Turns computer around to kris Jenner and Pete Davidson*  Toms slowness to what’s going on is literally me not caring enough to keep up with Hollywood news either
Zendaya is looking peak MJ here
gossip girls producers watching this
Jacob is looking like a young Lex Luthor,
They have worked hard, they need a good vacation 😩😂👌🏾
i reaaally really love how the "young trio" got the "old trio" as result
ZENDAYA IS A SWIFTIE

You can tell she's so into Tom. Just can't keep her hands off of him. It's just too cute. I love love.😊
i know tom holland didn't pick the boys over batman..
“We love Jake”  Taylor Swift left the group
“We love Jake”  Me also being a Taylor fan: snap him out thanos🙄
They might all be high 😂😂.
Spider-Man NWH has Tom messed up
Why do i feel like they were all super high 😂😂
buzz queed fizz

Lmfao Zendaya stopping Tom from dropping spoilers on the Dr. Strange result 🤣👌
This cast has the most chemistry of any spider-man movie cast
I got peter Parker !
I got peter parker yessss
4:52 DID JACOB JUST SHEEEEESH
The new spider man movie was better than all avenger movies combined. I absolutely loved it.
They have amazing chemistry together. There are so many things to love in new Spiderman movie but these three interaction in the movie is up there on the top of the ladder.   2:00 no we don't Zendaya, we all team Taylor here.
They are in that place where they are zooted from being tired that's so cute
Now she looks like MJ
Quizzeez 😭💀💀💀😂

Zendaya taking out jake was personal
Tom thinking Pete Davidson and Kris Jenner are dating is STILL cracking me up.

They went from young to old characters
I WATCHED IT IT MADE ME CRY WHEN MAY DIED
Mj's red hair
Zendaya is actually looking like MJ in this video
After seeing the flick I'm so glad seeing them together. Gives me remorse :(
Is it just me or does Zendaya look like MJ from the comics? Like she is properly dressed up like her comic book counterpart. The red hair with bang and blue top.
Alternate Title : Spider-Man No Way Home cast not knowing how to talk for 5 minutes
the love triangle between tom holland, zendaya and jake gyllenhaal is something i never thought i needed until today
I swear Pete is showing up everywhere, My guy definitely made a deal with the Devil, lol

0:04 "And I'm Zendaya and I play... MJ" the way she said that kills me😂
Thats thumbnail...that's not nice u showed only 2 of them.
the connection between tom & zendaya 😩
Gossip girl is great that's why but the original one.
seeing who Tom was talking about when he asked “aren’t they dating now?” had me crying
Loving Zendaya’s  OG  Mary Jane Watson red hair with bangs vibes. *Also would love to see this trio do a non-Spidey movie together in the vain of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.😎✌🏻
The movie was amazing
“what’s wrong with us” PLS THIS WAS SO FUNNY-
I love how buzzfeed purposely use zendaya laying her head on tom as the thumbnail, one hell of a move to get people to click on the video  😆
“Watermelon Sugar ✨ah✨ by Harry Styles” 😂😂
Woah I wonder what happened to them on set. They seem tight. look at them.✌🏾❤️
now zendaya actually looks like mj from comics
I love sm.
"buzzfeed is worst than gossip girl" -jacob hahahahah
Umm buzzfeed we need the full version of this I need to see them taking alllll the quizzes
y'all knew what you were doing with that thumbnail. and tbh i respect that.
When they were mixing up their words especially Tom, gosh that was adorable!! 😂
Was I the only one who noticed, “I don’t know him *all that well*” . Blondie reference. I thought he would say gyllenhall 😂😂😂😂
No everybody hating Jake but those guys loving him... Guy, no
Zendaya's hair in this video reminds me of MJ's hair from the "into the spiderverse" movie. I kinda love it
I am loving all of your interviews. Very entertaining 😃
Is Zendaya wearing a wig
Poor Tom and his dyslexia, this was so cute 😂
💖💖💖
Sweetheart 😢
zendaya secretly is choosing to get rid of jake gyllenhall bc of taylor swift tho
Only Zendaya can call Tom "sweetheart" and "idiot" in the same video
5:07 that LAUGH THO
Too cute! #Quizzes
so we just gonna ignore jacob saying "buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl"?
BUZZ QUEED FIZZ T_T  OPEN SCHOOLS NOW  lmaooooo

Why is Jacob bald all of a sudden 😂
I took the quiz and got Peter Parker😜
It's so funny how their tongues twisted several times. LOL
NO HE THOUGHT KRIS IS DATING PETE 😭😭😭😭😭BWTF 😂😂😂😂😂
Tom is looking so much like harry potter here.
I literally ran to the comments after I heard zendaya say sweetheart
is it just me or did jacob loose some weight. very happy to support on his his weight loss journey
Why was her hair not like this?? It would have bee perfect
Zendaya looks like MJ now !!! Wtf!
I’m thankful that I’ve got an advisor for my life
Do I have to go ?
Zendaya saying "You're an idiot" reminded me of Josh and Ollie😂😂😂
but you’re extra oil🤣
Wait so was he high?
Distraction for the WORKSLAVES
Zendaya is indeed mj
Ah yes BuzzQueed Fizz
@2:14 that is SUCH a vibe right there. I can see people meming on this! Also @ 4:40 is a vibe!
Me being dyslexic related to tom in this interview on an personal level
Awww Tomdaya at 4:49 <333333333
The amount of words they misspelled LMAO
tom is so funny omg
Not him calling Dr Strange a di*k 😂
watched it last night! 100% recommended watching it
THE THUMBNAIL THO HAHAHHA
The best thumbnail I've ever seen
Guys, if one of you doesn’t need that extra computer your girl over here needs a computer really badly.
I did it and i got MJ🥰❤
Zendeya looks really good in this hair why she used to get hairstyle like jofra archer 🤣
They are so tired. Burn out.
This is one of the best videos/interviews I’ve seen with them of all time. You can tell they’re all such great friends (and Tom and Z are so adorable), not to mention they’re so hilarious and chilled out to watch! Great video, made my day Buzzfeed thanks a lot 😁 P.S. Zendaya’s look in these interviews and videos are GOLD with the blue dress and reddish hair, brilliant
I did it and got mj
Is Tom copying Tom hiddlestons hair??
I love them 😂😂
Aunt may dies and at the end everyone has to forget who Tom Holland’s Spider-Man is for everyone to be saved get spoiled
Aunt May dies in the movie lmao get spoiled
when zendaya said sweetheart to tom i almost started crying
the "buzz queed fizz" took me OUT
Is it just me or the video is lagging ???
Free laptops?!?! Damn
After watching this interview i got to know that I am not the only one who messes up while pronouncing some thing.
Zendaya is really rocking that comic Mary Jane hair. She gotta have her hair like that at some point in the movies
I don’t know if their loopy from jet lag or just exhausted from the press tour but each one of them making a mistake reading stuff out loud getting laughed at because it’s so silly then immediately doing it themselves! It was catching haha! “Buzz qeed fizz”! 🤣
This is to funny 🤣
I've honestly missed them sm😭
PUT JACOB IN THE THUMBNAIL
Not to be that gut but,,,,,,,The thumbnail is super disrespectful to jacob,,,,just saying🤷
They don’t need laptops they have laptops
Jacob is still a part of the video. Its really rude of them to not include him in the thumbnail :/
we're just gonna ignore 4:53 when Zendaya says "oh sweetheart"...
Looool I’m dead there’s so cute
They keep messing up their words lmao, I love these three!
zendaya don't look good on this hair colour but her voice always loved by me and Tom seems getting more romantic. And Jacob, yeah he is looking totally different which Jacob I know. This three are so cool in real life more than spiderman movie
Zendaya's hair is EVERYTHING 😍
Jacob seems like such a cool and funny guy to hang around with. Would love to drink a few beer with him lol
THIS MOVIE WAS FUCKING GASSSS ⛽️
this was ❤️😂👍🤩
QUIZZEEEZ WITH MY BESTIES LMAO
Zendaya has the perfect MJ hair here!!!
Zendaya is really serving Mary Jane realness with that hair 😍
OMG They broke Spider-Man
Simu as spider man Jacob as hob goblin  What if...
This felt so short. I could watch hours of them playing random buzz queed fizzes 😂😂
I'm peter parker!
The start where they introduced themselves and the characters they play felt weird. Like 'oh you play Peter in Spider-Man, thanks I didn't know that' 😂😂
I got PETER PARKER!!! ❤❤❤
I’m screaming. They’re definitely tired from all the press they’re doing. Bless their souls haha.
Great movie......but all three Look like the stupid leftis that they are....pathetic. u cant buy style....
THIS WAS SUCH A CHAOTIC VIDEO I CAN’T😭😭😭😭😭
not Tom thinking Kris is dating Pete😭😭😭😭
my name is Eileen and i loved it when he said my name😂
Dear god she looks good.
2:02 c'mon, Single Ladies, Zendaya in the car, Umbrella, we all know, and if you don't, smh
"based on what they've done, mysterio gotta go" YES HE GOTTA GO
i just took the quiz and i got peter parker! <3
them talking about jake made me want to close that video
Not tom thinking that kris is kim 😂
This was a joy
when toby and andriew and tom interview 🔥💥
buzz queed fiz
"I would love to be Spider Man" Said every kid in the world.
Why didn’t they say goblinnnnn
I love them so much 😂
No one gonna talk about how zendaya really look good at red hair and hope to see it on future spidey films
Guess she's actually MJ now?
Yo her hair colour and hairstyle is FREAKING accurate to the comicbook design of Mary Jane.
4:30 I lost it with everything after this oh my god😭😭😭😭😭
I love them so much
zendaya called him sweetheart🥲 MY HEART
Just watched spider man no way home and I’m legit cryinggg there better be more someone please tell me if the will be moreee 😭😭
LMFOQOAOAOA TOM😭😭😭😭😭😭
THIS WAS AMAZING OH MY GOD
Face it : We all came to this video just because Zendaya was leaning on Tom in the thumbnail.
Looking more MJ here than whole trilogy
I love how Tom referenced taylor swift
Why didn't tom Holland choose umbrella?!!
It was soooo good
This didn’t age well lol. “Jake you’re great” not a Taylor swift quote.
This is so pure. none of that are scripted. love them.
god i will never get over this, doing press with your best friends looks like SO much fun
Zendaya looks so much more like Mary Jane
5:07 TOMS LAUGH😭😭💕
THIS WAS SO FUN😆😆😆
"we love jake"   i can already hear the swifties rumbling in the distance
Zendaya looks more like MJ herr
Man. Where’s Jacob in the thumbnail??!!
Plsss i think all of them are *sleep deprived* lmaaoo
I fucken love Jacob Batalon
WE WANT THIRST TWEET
Zendaya looks even more like classic comic book Mary Jane. Cool.
they should change the title to: "tom holland struggling with speech for almost 6 minutes straight"
I haven’t got to see it yet... I should’ve preordered the tickets... They both came back at just the right time
Sorry but Tom Holland cheering yes to come on Eileen is the most British thing ever
4:37 the way she looks at him here 😭
Literally hundreds of interviews featuring these guys lately. And in all of them Tom is wearing hair like a 80s dinner lady and a jumper that I've only ever seen beside a dead cat in a piss stained alley or on a tramp.
Really enjoyed the movie, good job the three of you 👍👍👍
judging by how they're acting this is a buzz weed quiz and nothing else
Y'all actually hand those laptops out to the interviewees??
They are so exhausted from this press tour
WHY CAN'T THEY TALK LOL RGRBUDIE😭🤣💀
they know what they're doing with that thumbnail lmao
You telling me these three were trying to go to MIT😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭 love them all!!! This is actually comedy 😂😂
We don’t love Jake , not after Taylor. Not after Taylor.
I laughed a lot...you guys are mixing a lot of word
Cast of spiderman trying to read but FAILING miserably for 5:56 straight-
thumbnail really said WHO? is jacob batalon ?
Repent for your sins thank and pray to God
3:26 Tom how dare you call Doctor strange a dick. Its due to Your foolishness all these madness happened. He tried to correct it ASAP before further destruction. But you suddenly became too innocent after listening to your Aunt may speech. And decided to help them but in that process you lost everything. He wanted what is best for this whole world. He is no Spiderman. But he is one of the most practical person in the world. Stephen was a dick but not strange.
Wow! Zendaya's hairstyle resembles MJ from the comic books.
oh no.... our tom.... ✨he's broken✨
Tom is ZOOted 🍃🤣
They should do with other two spi**** m**
Yall knew exactly what you were doing with the thumbnail
I got Peter Parker. As expected.
I love these guys, you can tell they are such great friends. LOVE ITTTT!
So Tom isn’t a Taylor fan huh 😐 Zendaya knows what’s up
1:31 WE LOVE AN accidental ALL TOO WELL REFERENCE
they are RAN THROUGH from all those interviews 😭 this was entertaining to say the least
This is so funny😭 there all out of it😂
I like tom hollands style he is fresh as MF
This is absolute gold. Hilarious. But Zendaya calling Tom 'sweetheart'? I CAN'T AKJBHKDUHKUSHK
Why was this video so good this video wins the title of the best video on yt
Tom's forgetting how to pronounce words ?! 🙄 It must've been Dr. Strange's fault .  😡 If you know you know ! 😉
They project besties energy and I am so here for it. It feels so genuine, I love it
“You’re extra oil” “Singing ladies- Beyonce” “Buzz Queed Fizz” “Quizzies”  - Tom Holland 2021
Did Tom pass English in secondary?
This is what Zendaya should look like in the film.
Tom is broken in this interview 😃🥰😃
Friendship goals ❤️
Bro Toms laugh at 5:05 is the funniest thing I’ve heard💀💀
none of them can read and I love it🤣
Most chaotic trio but it works and I love them together so much
Y’all really letting these white boys take our women huh?
0:29 “I would like to be Spider-Man.” It’s okay bro. You are Spider-Man!
Do we think they all get “zooted” in their free time? Hell I wouldn’t mind 😂
Petition to change Buzzfeed Quizzes to “Buzz Queed Fizz” SAY I

"We love Jake".... *Taylor Swift has left the chat*....
1000th comment

i searched buzz queed fizz and this came up. nice
ALSO Thank you Zendaya for proving you don't have to be a self proclaimed s*** to be talented and have a good career in Hollywood. To bad Bella Throne didn't get the message....

Omfg Tom and Zendaya....SO FRIGGIN PRECIOUS!!!! 😭😭😍😍
Zendaya is trying so hard to make me jealous 🙄
Bro Zendaya with that hairstyle is literally MJ, if she looked like that in the movies it would be perfect

Me:  loves TH who's head over heels inlove with Jake Also Me: sings All Too Well 10 min version on a daily basis
I just watched it
This is now my new favorite Tom, Zendaya, and Jacob interview…
Their interviews can get you through depression
This is just them having a hard time reading for 5 minutes and I love it 😂
At least Tom was a Parker
Hi
2:06 HAHAH “Watermelon sugar... haaa” 👼🏻🍉
Wait, they get to take the laptop home?!
1:40 immediately jake gyllenhaal i am a taylor stan idc
After watching  Spiderman: no way home, i realize that the best Spiderman is.. .. .. still Tobey Maguire and he will always be.
They’re clearly running on E with all the press tours. Lol!
i love how everyone's english is fucking terrible in this 💀
This was such a good video
lmaooo i thought tom was saying quizzies on purpose.
BUZZ FEED IS RICH exactly when your broke your broke you act broke and when your company has money they show it through action. I love a company that's kind and strives to inclusivity.
The chemistry these three have is what makes this the best Spider-Man cast.
Who came here cos of the thumbnail? 😁🙋‍♀️
Can we talk about how Zendaya has the classic Mary Jane hair. just thought she looked more like MJ in this interview, than she did in the movie, lol, jk.
Tom: watermelon sugar Jacob: hiiigh ❤️
When zendaya put her head on Toms shoulder 😍😍
Kris Jenner and Pete 😁
Buzz Queed Fizz
cant believe tom loves jake gynecologist the swiftie in me is crying 😖
The affection Zendaya and Tom Holland show for each other is so fucking adorable.
“Beyoncé always” reminded me of Michael Scott “I am Beyoncé always”.
zendaya went with the comic book mj look for this and i am HERE for it
HAHA THAT ALL TOO WELL REFERENCE WITH JAKE
Love that character that much even after watching this movie do that insane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybz5m3FFvkg
what a chaotic trio huhu fr ngl
not Kris and Pete Hahahhahahahauha
what’s up with them leaving Jacob out of the thumbnail that’s kinda shitty...
Buzz Queed Fizz. Nuff said.
Zendaya looks so good with bangs!
Tom, Zendaya and Jacob were all dyslexic this episode
I ship tom and zendaya cause they cute together
This just proves how tired they are from the press tour
Buzz Queed Fizz
They’re all so overtired LOL
We're just going to ignore Zendaya's amazing MJ do?
4:49-4:54 cutest moment of Tom and zendaya
is no one gonna acknowledge the fact that tom said Buzz Quiz Feeds twice instead of buzz feed quiz?
it is the "Singin Ladies, Adaption, Parsanality, Buzz Quid Fizz, and Quizzies" for me HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Anybody gonna talk abt Zendaya doing her hair up like MJ's from the comics. Actually fire ngl
dude this is the funniest ever ahahahhahah please
На русском базарьте пж
Good to know this guy is British 🇬🇧 I always thought he was American for some reason
I just watched the movie today it was GREAT
no but how sleep deprived were they collectively as a group before they stepped onto take this quiz
Today, I watched “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and I am very impressed with this movie. This is such a great movie. Very well done. Zendaya is so beautiful. ♥️
Budd queez fizz quizzies
petition for buzz feed to change their name to "buzz queed fizz"
DID ZENDAYA RLY J SAY SHE LOVES JAKE GHYLENHALL
PLEASE THE THUMBNAIL-
Spider-Man: No Way Home was awesome and an emotional roller coaster. It has very good writing and directing. The cast did amazing. I was crying a few time 😭
But you guys are not supposed to know each other
Tom: “aren’t they dating??” *shows pete davidson and kris jenner* LMAOOO I LAUGHED SO HARD AT THAT 😭😭
His oh my god at the end 💀🤣
Did anyone else catch Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart? 😍😂
My result was accurate too.   MJ: You're sarcastic, smart, and loyal. Like MJ, it takes you a little while to open up to new people, but once you do, you become their friend for life. You're a glass-half-empty kind of person who sometimes needs reminding that good things can happen. Your biggest support system is your best friends.
Jacob laughing brings me great joy.
"Buzz Queed Fizz" 😂😂😂 They've done too many interviews by this point.
them say that they love jake gyllenhaal makes me laugh
Zendaya saying "awww buzz queed fizz... *giggles while patting him**?? ALMOST DROPPED MY HEART!!😩😩💓💓💓
I’m looking for the interview where he mentioned bts but I was laughing the whole time
3:29 “they’ll understand once they watch it” I understand… i understand now
Even after far from home i still love dr.strange lol
I’ll just say it purely because i want to i think zendaya got rid of jake gynaecologist because of red taylor’s version
Zendaya coincidentally have the MJ look in this vid
I love these three! They should be role models for young people!
Buzzfeed just cropped Jacob in the thumbnail. WTF MAN?!
6 minutes of them struggling to speak English
2:05 SOMEBODY SAID HIGH WHEN TOM SAID WATERMELON SUGAR 🤣🤣🤣
BUZZ QUEED FIZZ. you guys need to rebrand.
Tobey comes back and gets stabbed by goblin.
Oww my back! Iykyk LOOL ims o happy
a content i never knew i need it
i love this video so  much
Lol at the end he also said “Buzz Quiz Feed” and it’s Buzz Feed Quiz
My heart can't handle this 4:49
this one is so hilarious🤣🤣
Jacob cursing >>>>>
2:12 its so cute i repeat it again and again
I love for this trio, they’re all a mess😂
I didnt expect theyd be simply wrong by those simple words. I thought it was only us asians lmao
Tom not picking Umbrella as his karaoke song was a crime 😭😭
"Aw sweetheart" AWWWWWWWWW MY HEART
They are the best
5:11 LMFAO “aren’t they dating each other” I’M DECEASED 😂😂
You guys knew what you were doing when you picked that thumbnail
LMAO what is up with the cast and reading in this interview? I feel like Tom and Jacob read everything wrong 😭😂😂
Man seeing toby and andrew on screen was one of the best feelings ever
“I am Tom and I play PeEtAh” idk this was just too cute, I think I never heard Tom say Peter with his original accent and I loved it
https://youtu.be/2lDl63kMg8U
Wait a minute, is Zendaya having red hair?
Zendaya actually looks like Mary Jane
i love how sometimes their brain’s stop working and cant seem to say words 😭😂 from investigative/investigator, to parsonality
just give rest to these guys.. too much of promotions
Zendaya is a swiftie confirmed #jakegyllengallremoved
i was hoping tom would pick umbrella because of his lip sync battle
i was hoping tom would pick umbrella because of his lip sync battle
4:54 when Zendaya said sweetheart!
It's crazy how makeup makes her look like a full grown women whereas no makeup in the film makes her still look like a recent high school grad
Is it me or does tom seem unlikeable…this time around?
Tom is so tired 😂😂 I love him
Hi, BuzzFeed! Unfortunately, you are now legally obligated to change your brand name to BuzzQueed! Love your fizzes.
Not y’all cropping my guy out in the thumbnail smh 🤦🏼‍♂️
Zendaya calling tom sweatheart is something i didnt know i needed
Zendaya: "Thank you so much to buzzfeed" Tom quietly: "quiz fizz"🤣🤣🤣
Why do they look and sound normal in the movie...???.. What's up with that...???...
Well i got Spider-Man so I'm happy
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TOM AND ZENDAYA ARE SO CUTE WTFFFFFFFFFFFDIJFBIFHBWJFHBEWFH
anyone else stuck on zendaya calling him sweetheart but also THEY GET TO KEEP THE COMPUTERS?!?!?!
ITS FINALLY HERE🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️https://youtu.be/9bwZ6xh_M2Y

ITS FINALLY HERE🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️https://youtu.be/9bwZ6xh_M2Y
I know TomDaya gets yall clicks, but it straight up disrespectful to not include Jacob on the thumbnail
5:39 “Oh my gaw!”
Jacob looks like he’s lost weight lol
2:05 ¨watermelon sugar ´high´ by harry styles¨ when tom said this my harry girl brain just kinda blew up cuz that sentence right there is the combination of my two favorite people!!
Best interview ever! Peridot
Buzz queed fizz lol
My ship sails strong.
BUZZ QUEED FIZZZZ
tom didn't hesitate to choose chris evans, and i felt that to my core
I think I heard Tom suffers from dyslexia. I envy him though I would kill to have Zendaya care for me like that lol
literally made my day 😂😂
they knew what they were doing with that thumbnail
No way home is " amazing " the best scene was when Andrew and Tobey showed up I just froze! Too bad Aunt May died.
buzzfeed..Jacob is also in this video..don't be disrespectful of him just for the views.
I just watched no way home and had so my emotions🥺🥲🙂😂😥😐🥺
now that the movie is out they look so much less stressed im happy for them AND ZENDAYA CALLED TOM SWEETHEART IN THE CUTEST VOICE
“i don’t know him all that well”… sneaky
Now she got MJ look
There's a typo in the title, it's supposed to say Quizzeees
they knew what they were doing with the tumbnail
I just remembered that Tom is dyslexic, but that was super cute still. Especially Zendaya calling him sweetheart
THIS MAKES ME HAPPY!!🥰🥰🥰
WHEN ZENDAYA SAID OH SWEETHEART TO TOM OMGGGGG
SPIDER - MAN NWH is the BEST MOVIE EVER, my heart is still racing after watching it yesterday.🥰😍 Love the film and you guys so much💕❤♥  hoping for more amazing films like this in the future. God Bless You'll and Stay Safe 🙏🏻♥
The way they do the friend thing of immediately making fun of how you mispronounce things 😂
This video is iconic, but also the quiz is scarily accurate
This is definitely the best press video that I’ve seen of them so far😂❤️
I got Dr. Strange too!!!!!!!
BuzzQueed Fizz is what this should be called from now on
Totally got Peter Parker! Hell yes!
The general group tiredness after weeks of press, mixed with Tom's Dyslexia made quite the combination haha! bless them! Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart too 🥰
Zendeya actually looks like Mary Jane MJ👀
now i will call it buzz queed fizz too 😂
Loved this . But what does Benedict wong have to do with umbrella academy?
Jacob hating gossip girl for no reason 😂
PLEASE WHAT WAS TOM ON
I got Peter 😌
poor guys cant speak because they're having a long press tour. probably didn't get enough sleep with a bunch of jet lag.
Omg do they actually give them the laptops?😳
they knew what they were doing with that thumbnail
the fact that they all can't read well 😭
They are definitely lit in this video and I love it lmaooo
this the best video I've ever seen
love how they literally laugh at eachother not being able to talk LMAOSJDIAOED
the way none of them can talk is giving me life
4:50 Zendaya saying “awww sweetheart” their relationship is like an old married couple
I don't understand why someone would hate Tom
4:40 Tom : "What is wrong with us?" Well.. ThAt'S nEw!  But seriously, what did buz feed feed them with? They are like drunk. extraoil (extra loyal)  singing ladies (single ladies)  adaption (adaptation)  pasanality (personality)  buzz queed fizz (buzz feed quiz)  quizzies (quizzes)
I got Dr Stephen Strange
Tom laughing like a British grandma at 5:07  While Jacob has the face of Nemo at 5:10 😂
BYEEE THE Kardashian THING
I just saw the movie and I cannot I loved it so much
Zendaya with red hair look like MJ in comics 😍
You can tell that they're tired!  Their words are all over the place 😂
Zendaya looks more MJ comic accurate here
Jacob swears too much.
jacobs obession with gossip girl is literally ME ASHGAHGSHAGH
ALGUEM LEGENDA EM PORTUGUÊS BR POR FAVOR
They are such a kids, live them
I swear, in each and every last one of these interviews, Zendaya always finds a way to look so insanely beautiful.
The way all of their results matched them perfectly
1:59 oh
Them not knowing how to read or talk is the best thing ever 😂😂😂❤️❤️💙
Perfeitos ❤️🥺🤌🏻
Why is he bold
This trio is hilarious! Most fun interview ever!
I think what we can take away from this is the fact that Tom Holland does NOT know who the Kardashians are!
Zendaya with that red hair really looking like MJ
From aww sweetheart 4:45 to ur an idiot 5:10❤️❤️❤️
"Buzzfeed is worse than Gossip Girl" Jacob coming in HOT with that one
them: love u jake all the tay tay fan: F U JAKE GYLLENHAAL
2:03 DID HE JUST SAY OLIVIA RODRIGO, I'M NOT OKAY HELP
They laughed it off but is it really funny?  Knowing he’s dyslexic??
This press tour has me convinced that Tom and Zendaya are soulmmates. You cannot convince me otherwise. 💗💗
“mysterio’s got to go” “but it’s jake gyllenhaal. i can’t do that”
I took the test and got Peter Parker
Looking forward to them doing more Bud Queef Zizzies in the future
The faces Tom makes every time he messes a word up……. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this trio receive so much hate just bacause they are youg, rich famous  and popular, but they are so sweet and friendly
I love how they mis rponounce on what their trying to say 😂😂😂
Don't like jacob, swears to much nearly every interview.
Yes Tom you should do another Buzz Queed Fizz
CUTIES
There so cute together 😩
"bro buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl" - jacob
what we learned is that that everyone needs to practice their reading
I can't stand at Zendaya's hairstyle. She's really Tom's Mary Jane!  PS. Her hairstyle reminds me of Mary Jane from Into the Spider-Verse.
best mcu trio
jordan is so funny i love him
<3
Tom Holland's getting May Parker character is spot on due to what transpires in NWH.....
Put Jacob in the thumbnail you bastards
The chemistry of this trio. Over the top. Always so fun.
my favourite trio i really cant get enough of their interviews
They are crackheads in the MCU and in real life…
Hi guys I'm from Belarus my dream is to be photographed with Tom Haland. But I know it's not going to happen. 😭😭😭. Because our schools do not teach English well, and even more so until I grow up and learn English and fly to America Tom Halland will stop acting. Good luck. Hopefully I can still take a picture with Tom, and if possibly Good luck guys.
I took the quiz as they did it and got Peter Parker😝
Bruh lol if zendaya's gonna dye her hair red now. Why didnt she do it in the movies lol. I mean her hairstyle is mj's in the comics
Buzzfeed give us the whole uncut reel, NOW.
high They
Tom thinking that Pete Davidson is dating Kris Jenner got me choking--
almost 6 minutes of pure comedic gold. They're just like best friends hanging out yet all three of them are so hilarious.
Watching this you can really see Tom's dyslexia. I am dyslexic too so I can totally relate!
When Zendaya looks more like classic MJ when she's NOT playing her.
“and im only gonna say this because i dont know him all that well” 💀💀
Come on Eileen is just SUCH a british song i love how Ton went “yesssss” hahahahahaha
Good news, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and eat with him, and he with me."Revelation 3:20 Belive in God's son Jesus today, repent of your sin, dont be left behind. Love Y'all
I kinda wanna laugh hard with Tom jumbling the letters in words like that but WAIT THAT'S WHAT MY BRAIN DOES ALL THE TIME 👀
"Buzzfeed is worse than Gossip Girl. Toxic"  Absolute truth
I fully support zendaya getting rid of jake as a swiftie lolol
Poor Tom has been doing so much press "Can we do another buzz queed fizz wait--" " Can we do more quizzees " " Tom: Arent they dating now. Jacob: no thats the mother" " Ok guys I think that's enough buzz queed fizzes for today"
The fact that all of them forgot how to english during this interview makes me LOL
the “aren’t they dating each other” at pete and kris gave me heart attack😂😂😂
2:12 AWW THAT LIO BONDING MOMENT
Don't cropped my man Jacob ever again. Anyways, this whole video was really funny
I got Petah Parker.
Zendaya: "we love jake"  Me: *do we though?*
Umbrella academy is amazing
I got MJ. Love you Zendaya.
John 3:16 [16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  John 14:6 [6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Matthew 18:11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  John 8:12 [12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.   Matthew 4:17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  Luke 13:3 [3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   Luke 6:27-38 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,  6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.  6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.  6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.  6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.  6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.  6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.  6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.  6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.  6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.  6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:  6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.  Matthew 5:2-12 King James Version 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.  Matthew 24:4-14  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   ....................................,,,,,,,,.........,,  ..........
I love #Zendeya she is perfect for choosing #TheDarkKnight that the girl #Tom don't screw up 😂🕷🕸🦇
These three do the best press runs!
It took me 3 movies to realise Zenday doesn’t play Mary Jane, she plays Michelle Jones
"buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl" jacob is hilarious
"Sweetheart" 😲❤️💖😍 Aweee!!!
5:07 TOMSA LAUGH 😂❤️❤️
Jacob just being a third wheel for all interviews
4:49 beautiful.
Couple of the decade. 💕
Tom Holland: *exists*    Every organism with a X and Y chromosomes: *hey*
tão meus
Guys is Tom balding ?
NOT ONLY DID ZENDAYA CALL HIM SWEETHEART BUT SHE HELD HIS HAND AND RUBBED IT! OMG!!!!😂
Why is nobody talking about how they get to keep the macbooks??
Tom's brain just stopped working lol I dont blame him or them, they have been doing awfully huge amount of press lately, anyone would crack I suppose 😅 Also Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart was the cutest 🥺♥️ And also having seen the film,trust me guys it's every bit worth the hype and just increased my love and appreciation for Tom,he was brilliant in it, easily his best performance.
“You’re an idiot”.  She’s like robin Scherbatsky truly meaning she loves you when she says that. Haha  Zendaya and Tom have really been maturely open about how they feel. It’s not a forced thing. They also don’t shove it in your face. They don’t hide it. It just naturally comes out. True honest love.
Shit she looks more like MJ here that in all of the spiderman movies.
the way zendays said jake's the worst lmfaoo
Jacob third wheeling like 👁👄👁
Base on all these interviews, i think Zendaya’s love language is physical touch
"I would like to be Spider Man." I don't blame you, Tom. I'm surprised Tom didn't pick Umbrella!
Awwwww tom
Hilarious moments starts from here  4:30 🤣🤣  I mean, come on how goofed up a person can be.. that was damn funny 😆😆
Loving Zendayas hair
LMAOOO aren't they dating each other? And it's Kris and Pete. I can't!
5:04 not Pete and Kris I’m in TEARS 😭🤣🤣🤣
zendaya getting rid of jake ist what keeps me alive, i bet she has listened to red tv AHAHAHSH
Why dose Tom look like a Dad
Everyone: i don't care who i get Tom:  i want to be spiderman 😀
LMAO THIS IS HILARIOUS AHAHAHA
I’m loving this press tour
Zendaya with that hair looks like Mary Jane Watson from comics.
AWW SWEETHEART
i can tell this was late at night and they were tired as hell lol
at this point, i just think that tom intentionally messes up words so that others can have a laugh lol
5:20 The way they look into each other's eyes!
I need to know did they literally get the laptops for free
I love how jacob talk always about gossip girl. Such a mood when im Obsessed  with a new serie or movie lol
Tom and Zendaya they are so adorable wtfffff 🥺🥺❤️💖
If this is how often they mispronounce words, imagine the frustration of the crew having to retake everytime they do it on set 😂❤
DONT MIND ME thinking tom would choose umbrella
Anyone want to point out that they seem high as hell for this interview? Haha
i could’ve watched these three for other five minutes, this was hilarious!
That thumbnail, I see your game BuzzFeed. And I’m gonna play x
00:03 tom saying petah
Aww sweetheart 🥰🥰🥰 my heart xx
⚠ SPOILER WARNING ⚠             everyone: ZENDAYA SAID SWEETHEART 😍😍😍    me: ned might actually be related to wong and become a Sorcerer in future MCU movies.......wtf
They’ve done so much press they can’t even talk anymore 🤣
do they all have new m1 macbook pros? just wondering. seems a bit much for a buzzfeed quiz lol
buzz qeed fizz
why dose Zendaya have her that looks like MJS in the comics
i know zen and tom are the highlight nowadays but come on, you can do better, at least put jacob on the thumbnail if you put his name on the title
Not zooted😭
Why’s zendaya looking like mystique 🤣
These guys cannot read lmao
Buzz queed fizz
When these guys get together it’s always jokes. Jacob bringing up Gossip girl every min, “aren’t they dating each other now?”😭
The best interview!
"Sweetheart"... It killed me 😭.  I'm so jealous 😭😭😭.
Tom gets a pass. He’s dyslexic. I don’t know what J & Z were on though. 😄
Jacob could be the next superhero,, seeing him getting healthy and more confident,, its like he setting up to be a hero,,
i love how jacob always brings up gossip girl
zendaya and tom  😍😍😍😭
after watching the movie, i feel like spiderman WOULD get aunt may so this is very on brand even though tom didn't get peter
Tom is Zooted 🤣
Why do Zendaya looks like she is going full Mary Jane for the next movie
Y’all leaving Jacob out of the thumbnail is wrong af
This is bringing me so much serotonin wow
Does this video contain any spoilers?
I got MJ
Aye zendaya and I got Doctor Strange HELL YEA
I hate how adorable they all are 🤣🙏🏽
Alternate title: the cast of spiderman struggling to read
4:53 Zendaya to Tom: Sweetheart ❤
this video really should just be "5:55 of the cast of Spiderman NWH not being able to read"
Anybody else notice zendaya's ring, it's so pretty!
5:04 my god i laughed sm
This interview will be quoted A LOT
I choose goblin. Can't say why.
is it me or its just Zendaya have the classic MJ hairstyle
Buzz queed fizz 😂😂😂
Ah yes. “Extra oil” and “buzz queed fizz”
5 minutes and 56 seconds of Tom, Zendaya and Jacob struggling to read basic english💀💀
that’s utterly fucked up to list all of the trio in the title and then cut Jacob out totally as if he doesn’t matter to only play up this totally not at all a pr romance to their tweenie shippers. How fucking rude to Jacob.
Is gossip girl really that bad?😂
''Tom is ZOOOTED, my guy'' Tom dying from laughter Zendaya: QUIZZIES! <3  My favorite part. They're hilarious😂😂😂😂
SWEETHEART
watch “can we do another buzz queed fizz?” be another one of those iconic quotes by the marvel cast
she said my name. my life is complete now.
Its cute how excited they are about the laptops.
You'd think they've had too many to drink with the amount of mistakes they made 😅
THIS WHOLE VIDEO IS LITERALLY THEM STRUGGLING LFMAMAOQKAOAKQ
"I cAnT do that to JAKe"
thats cap
🙌
I officially dare BuzzFeed to change the name on all of their quiz pages BuzzQueed Fizz for the duration of the theatrical run of No Way Home
Zendaya really looks like a lightskin Maryjane especially with that hairstyle.
The way tom said “I am Peter” as if he’s not allowed to say he’s spider man cause it’d be a spoiler 😭
stop zendaya called tom sweetheart shut UP
I’m such a big fan ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
I just watched Spider-man no way home and I love these people on a different level now
Who else rewatched this video for all of the hilarious word mispronunciation moments?
This is amazing
Cuando se estrena Madres Paralelas?
Ironic how zendaya looks more like the original MJ in this than the movie
Why is no one talking about how they cut out Jacob from the thumbnail?🥺🥲
The laugh at 3:41 🥺😂
Now we need one with either alfred molina willem dafoe and jamie foxx or one with tobey and andrew
"Buzz quiz feed"😂😂😂, and nobody noticed
Buzz queed fizzes 😂
They smoked. Yeah they smoked😂😂
zendaya’s a swiftie after getting rid of mysterio
90% is just them trying to talk😭 I can't
Yess
😭 “zooted my guy”
I’ve been waiting in FOREVER to watch Spider-Man in the theatres, only for my mf country to go into lockdown once again bc of a corona-mutant, resulting in them closing all the theatres ‘til next year. Love my life 🥲
The way they cut off Jacob in the thumbnail 😭
Mom and Dad and our favourite child 😍💖😂 These 3 are ICONIC
Jacob, Tom and Zendaya all share the same three braincells and all belong to Zendaya
AKA watch Tom Holland slowly forget how to read
@4:55 i can’t tell if that’s jacob’s or tom’s voice that said “quizzies” high-pitched. it was still funny though 😂
*J JONAH JAMESON REMINDS ME OF GOSSIP GIRL* I can't
Tom and Zendaya are so cuteeee
Zendaya really does look like comic accurate Mary Jane
Man these kids must be on crack 😭 2:11  2:29 4:04 4:30 4:42 5:04
Why can't everything be this pure and fun?
5:04 Crying at the fact that Tom thought Pete and Kris Jenner were dating 🤣🤣
"BuzzFeed is really really rich" 😂😂
they 100% smoke together before interviews lmaoo I love that for them
IN THE MOVIE AT THE END I REALLY WANTED PETER TO ASK MJ TO BE FREINDS BUT HE DIDNT WAAAA
Tom: Aren't they dating?  *Points at Kris Jenner and Pete Davidson* I LOST IT AT THERE HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
I wannna do a Buzz Queed   Fuiz 😭😭😭💕
It's like the editors of this video saw all the craze about Tomdaya starting back up and was like, "This'll get them to watch for sure."
2:05 “watermelon sugar HIGH”
wait if tom is may parker and jacob is john favreau would they date in the movie
That was the best vid with those 3 ever 🤣 best squad in Hollywood
Awe tom and zendaya are so cute!
I don't understand Zendaya hype. She tries so hard to be relevant
<333
I love the head on the shoulder shot. Also I love that Jacob is totally third wheeling but it doesn’t matter but everyone has amazing chemistry and you can totally tell they are genuinely friends and love each other
the laugh at 2:14 is so cute
I hate this feeling but I need to click like 😅
Jacob and Zendaya: I think all the characters are pretty cool Tom: I wanna be Spider-Man!  💀✋
no offense but this partnership is starting to feel more and more like anne hathaway and james franco hosting the oscars.
I thought it was quiz-EEs too. I swear that’s how teachers would say it
This is arguably the most hilarious interview on the whole press tour, and Z calling Tom sweetheart was the icing on the cake.
They all have such a great relationship with each other...wishing them all the best
Wow how many of these interviews/games did they do? They must be so exhausted; they keep mispronouncing words that they’re trying to say
WHY DID ZENDEYA HAVE HER HAIR LIKE THIS IN NO WAY HOME OMGGGGG ITS AMAZING!!!!!
Can we all appreciate Jacob for a minute? I mean he's really sweet, funny and seems like such a kind person ❤️
“aren’t they dating each other now” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE THEMMMMM
anyone else notice how zendaya's hairstyle is the same as Mj in the comics?
Jesus loves you and is coming back ❤️
"Hey boss, remember those notebooks? Yeah... We lost them."
tOm Is ZOoTeD mY  GuY sHeEeEEEeeEEeeeeeeSh
I can't believe he lied to us about Toby and Andrew
Peter Parker Your personality matches Peter Parker. You're ambitious, nerdy, and compassionate. Like Peter, you're someone who often puts the needs of others above your own. You want to make sure everyone feels included and you love surrounding yourself with a close-knit group of friends. You want to make this world a better place.
Tom almost said queef on the internet this man is the biggest light in this world
Jacob shouting out simu and Asian pride is everything. And Tom loving Jake
Imagine the movie is great and the press tours are lit as well it's definitely been a good way to end the year thanks u guys
not me staring at zendaya throughout the whole vid- shes stunning omg😩‼️
Man, these three have such an amazing friendship
Zooted??
I know is not an engagement ring in Z's finger, but I almost thought it was for a second kjfdngkdf
Ah yes, i love my little dyslexic baby
Tom is a dyslectic if I ever saw one
Love zendaya's wig
"tom is zOOTED my guy"  i love jacob so much
Buzz queed fizz
I'm sorry, I just keep replaying the "Buzz Queed Fizz" bit too much 😂😅😂
Lol such a fun interview!
Tom:  "Can we do another Buzz Queed Fizz?"      Tom: "Let's click on Quizzies."  Zendaya:  "Oh, sweeheart."    (My heart melted)      Tom:  "We've been doing the Buzz Quiz Feeds."      Tom Holland has reached maximum press tour saturation.  🙂
They’re all such cute friends
The title of this video should be: Spider-Man: No Way Home cast cannot English
Tom, a Gemini saying he wants to take another quiz because he loves quizzes is such a Gemini thing
Buzzqueed Fizz
Queezeez 🤣😂 it’s quiziz
Jacob must really love “Gossip Girl “ 😂  Hopefully not the reboot 👀
I can rest in peace after hearing Zendaya saying sweetheart to Tom Holland. 🥰
why’d they cut jacob out of the thumbnail 😭😂
Tom has seen 'The Boys', what!
Extra oyal 😂😂
Women breaks friendships. Facts
I wish they hair Zendaya looking like this in the movie with the whole mj look😍😍
Zendaya looks stunning with this hair
Zendaya calling him sweetheart is the sweetest thing ever.
We need more from this pls! This was so funny! 🤣
“awe sweetheart” CRYING BANGING MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL SCREAMING
The way she immediately comforted him from the embarrassment WIFE HER TOM
There weren’t any iPads?
SHE CALLED HIM SWEETHEART IM CRYING
4:54  Z calling Tom sweetheart --- awww... so sweet
I got                        MJ  Your personality matches MJ. You're sarcastic, smart, and loyal. Like MJ, it takes you a little while to open up to new people, but once you do, you become their friend for life. You're a glass-half-empty kind of person who sometimes needs reminding that good things can happen. Your biggest support system is your best friends.  That’s so true and 4:30 haha
hilarious trio 🤣
damn you can see they do so much press omg. they look so tired but good tho
So this is a macbook promotion!
why's dude bald?
buzzqueed fizzes
0:03 Peter 1 2 or 3 wich one

Zendaya LOOKS LIKE THE SPIDERMAN COMIC MJ I LOVE IT !!!
Tom: "Don't get rid of Jake!!" Me: *starts playing All Too Well (10min Version) (Taylor's Version)*

"Can we do another BUZZ QUEED FIZZ!?" - Tom Holland 2021

Tom's Dyslexia kicked in
buzz queed fizz > buzzfeed quiz

who did he say umbrella was by loooool 🤣🤣🤣
I saw the film yesterday, and it was AMAZING! You did such a good job and I can't wait for the next Spider-Man! 😁
Everyone going mad about Zendaya calling Tom her sweetheart I’m out here happy that Jacob called Jon Favreau a G
1:17 yees, zendaya and tessa! that would be amazing

the way they all said at least one word wrong in this interview 😭
“can we do another buzz queed fizz” “tom is zooted my guy”  I LOVE THEM SM 😭
The way Zendaya goes from calling him sweetheart to idiot in a matter of seconds is sending me 😂😂😂
Spoilers allert                 Iron Man dies

Maam this guy are so funny together their like goofy friends
Zendaya can’t keep her hands off him. She is so in love and I adore this couple. 🥰
the idea that tom got high and it R EA LLY kicked in midway through this video is funny even if it might not be true
Buzz Queed Fizz😆
Who just can't get enough of these flirting between Tomdaya? Feeling sad, depressed and in love rn
It wasn't really a change for jacob as somehow I find happy and ned to be quite similar characters. Plump, funny, adorable, and cool
Ok this is now one of my comfort vuds
LMAOAO WHEN HE THOUGHT KRIS JENNER AND PETE WERE DATING BYEE
I get you, Buzzqueed Fizzies are really addictive!  This was so much fun, good investment of 6 min of my life, thank u 👍
zendaya wearing the MJ hair
So nice to see MJ with red hair.
2:11 Tom: “singing ladies-“  4:30 Also tom: “buzz queed fizz” 4:41 Tom again: “let’s do some quizzies” 5:03 More Tom: “aren’t they dating now?” Jacob: “no! That’s her mom!😂😂” Jesus Tom was just out of it🤣
That was hilarious
Zendaya is so in love with Tom. I loved them.
This movie made me cry and laugh SO HARD!!!
not tryna be that person but yall need to put all three on the thumbnail don’t disrespect jacob like that😭😭😭😭
That movie was 😭 I have no words I don’t wanna spoil it
Did enjoy the moive. The best Spider-Man one in MCU yet. The hair though.  It is giving such strong "Mary Jane" vibes. What a tease, Zendaya! What a tease.
Wow they should have done this segment with Tobey and Andrew.
Tom: I’m not picking between Tobey and Andrew  Andrew: Tobey is the best
zendaya looks like MJ with that hair cut
“Aren’t they dating?” *shows a picture of Kris Jenner and Pete Davidson 😂💀
Tom not knowing exactly which Kardashian Pete Davidson is dating is honestly such a mood.
I love that zendaya made her hair red again 😍 this was such a fun video
I got happy. Take the quiz tell me who you get
This might as well be titled "Tom And Zendaya Struggle To Read & Jacob's Anti Gossip Girl Agenda" 😭
‘aren’t they dating’ IT TOOK ME OUT YALL OMG LITERALLY CRYING
This will get viral for sure
Tom, who makes more money a day than I did in a whole year saying: *Oh we can take these home with us?*  like it's the best thing ever just melted my heart
Y'all did not hold back with the thumnail :D
Im pretty sure z is a swiftie
the fact that tom has dyslexia poor baby🥲

Flooding with interviews!

I really want to know English better to understand all the interviews with this trio 🥺
My heart is so full! She called him sweetheart ♥️♥️
Tom your dyslexia is showing lmaoo
Zendaya with the classic MJ hair 😳
Awh I did the quiz and I got Peter parker
Quizzies with my besties on buzz queed fizz
"Buzzfeed is worse than Gossip Girl-"

I love them three so much!

i love how they just started doing more quizzes
This must have been at the end of a press day. 🤣
😊😜🤩😝
Post the extended version 😠 please 😠
Tell her that that wig make her look not natural.
"quizzies with my besties"😭
“oh sweetheart” sobbing.
Funny how this is the most mj, mj has ever mj’ed
This should just be Tom Holland struggling with dyslexia for five minutes straight 😂
they had to be so high in this
5:08 Tom's laugh 🤣🤣
Not Tom thinking that Pete Davidson is dating Kim. K’s mother. 😂😂
My girl zendaya is down sooo bad but I’m here for it😂
They fukin
the way zendaya laid her head on tom at 4:50 and called him sweatheart made me scream
"QUiZzIES wiht BeSTiESZZ"
Tom loves Spider-Man, but doesn't know Jonah j Jameson? He's one of Spider-Man biggest nemesis
5 mins and 6 secs of tom, zendaya, and jacob speaking alien 😂😂
Zendaya looks like Into the spider verse MJ in this
the “aren’t they dating” at kris jenner and pete davidson took me out-
That fatigue is setting in with all those mispronounciations 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t get enough of this cast, they’re too sick.
The thumbnail omg 😭
"buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl"
Also she is a wise old owl! She is the mom in this trio!
BUZZ QUEED FIZZES
I got Spidey
the way they’re literally just a group of besties hanging out and making shitty jokes. god i love them.
can they pls release the rest of the video where they do the other quizzes😭😭😭😭
This is just so genuine and fun 🧡
I think they are totally exhausted and then with Tom's dyslexia this was frigging hysterical I've watched it like 5 times and cannot stop laughing and the best part was when she called him sweetheart oh Zen is just brilliant why it opened on this prestore and shock anybody she's the one that always wanted to be so private and she can't keep her hands off tom or try this whole time it makes me so happy and this is all everybody was just saying all along just like Hey don't not be happy because you want to keep things from us just be yourself and enjoy life and be happy because we're just so happy for you It makes us ecstatic seeing finally that they can beat themselves and like I said oh my goodness if she's like this with Him are all these interviews you can imagine when it's just them together freaking adorable I'm just so happy that she's happy and confident in a relationship and she's also grown up now a lot of things that she said before she was young that was 1st love that was things that you thought I mean that was years ago everything changes because every person changes the people you're around so anyway they're just so cute You know it just gives everybody hope they just care about them as well they only reason they want to know not to be in their business but just cause they just enjoy seeing their love with all the hate going on and everything else in this day and time it's just so nice to pee people so in love and funny funny and just glad it's bad to be able to be themselves now!
the thumbnail 🥲
Thank you Tom, now I will never say buzz feed correctly again. 🤣🤣🤣
i don't see Jacob in the thumbnail🙄
"buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl" LOL
For now on it will always be quizzees😹😹😹😹🤟🏽
It's so cute/hilarious how they ALL suddenly can't read or talk 😂😂
Zendaya calling Tom sweetheart 🥺❤️
I LOVED THE CHUBBY NED , NOT FOSSIL LIKE LOOKING NED
This was unexpectantly hilarious. Also, I love how they all can't keep it together and at the end Zendaya says, "you're an idiot." lol 🤣
Zendaya is like babysitting those two😂😂
Just watched it, no spoilers (even though I had it spoiled) but it was amazing  Spoiler alert      So sad when aunt may dies and when they all forget he exists  Depressing
Tom just won so many points for picking Come on Eileen as his karaoke song ♥️
GOD I LOVE TOM SM
BuzzFeed knew exactly what they were doing with that thumbnail. They're so cute. F in the chat for Jacob tho.
ZENDAYA AND TOM ARE GOALS
'I cant do that to Jake' YES YOU CAN
Before anyone says anything, Tom and Z aren’t dating, it’s a pr stunt...
in order to cover up fact dnc love using thought police thugs burning loot during curfew=   they have cnn use smears like fascists or supremacists  on kyle rittenhouse for putting out fire.  this lead to blm driver crash car in to parade  dnc did this in 2016 too for coverup fact dnc order cops to stand down just to use thought police  thugs attack in san jose/charlotte, recall 50 shot in vegas/portland   dnc break glass 2017 inauguration claiming russia hack just to cover up fact bush/obama rig presidency kill 7 countries 5 years wesley clark memo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mrJRHwbVG8  treating covid symptoms is how to end pandemic but media ban smear it plus easy to sabotage clinical trials=over dose/  given too late/  inject with saline but false label to smear real potential  treatment  it is unfair that daca get better healthcare than middle class/self employed
buzzfeed can u send me macbook too
2:44 “buzzfeed is worse than gossip girl” so true
this is me when i'm texting fast
The way Zendaya wraps her arm around Tom when he messed up at 4:30 tho....!!
For anyone who’s feeling down: Romans 8:18 “The pain you’ve been feeling can’t compare to the joy that is coming!” John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” Whatever is going on right now, have faith, your situation will get better. :) Jesus bless anyone reading this and have a great day!!🥰✨💖
