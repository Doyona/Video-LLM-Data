If Steph was willing to play a role with KD to win, then Poole needed to accept his role.
GSW could have used JP this postseason
And now he's  a bum...like I said he benefited from playing with Step and them
They should’ve kept Jordan Poole. They need to go out and re-sign them again assigning trade.
Sounds like Jordan Poole just lacked maturity
Just a pretty boy with woman characteristics .
Once this guy is off steroids he’s done for. Body will shut down and he will have to do it till the day he’s gone
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty lol
Jordan is a pansy
Jordan got to Comfortable like he was a vet after that championship. Young Man came in to camp with that I got the bag attitude. I think JP is humble now and mature
What was he talking about it was no beginning no plot no ending , yall know whO im talking bout
man
He's a real human being!?  A real boy!?  Un-Pinnochio!?
March 13, 2025 Poole leads the Wizard's stats in points (21.1) , assists (4.7) and steals (1.4).  Poole got what he wanted - team of his own to lead and to showcase and validate his skills and basketball acumen.     Wizards are 13-51 - worst record in the NBA.
Poole cost them a chance to compete for another championship. The impression I got is that he thought he was better than he actually was, even while turning the ball over every time kerr subbed him in.
they just didn't want HIM to be that guy. But the guy brought it.... BUT lets look at the effect that after he gave it all and they all enjoyed success, why then, he is not appreciated, welcomed, and celebrated as the DREAM of winning and glory under sprinkles of champagne had foretold? if you are not giving credit where credit is due, then to what other purpose are we serving? Well, Shaq said: "The NBA stands for "Nothing But Actors"____ And the script again, does what it does, cause yet another depression in the field. PoetryLife
That was so weak though of the Warriors top guys to recognize JP’s contributions, but then keep tryna lil bro him.  They were mad that he didn’t defer to them. You gotta have an ego, that’s what makes great players great.  I think it would be nice to bring JP back and combine him with JK and Post for the Warriors future.
As an avid GS fan, I watched a lot of Jordan Poole...  When he was on, he was on.  The last year he played for GS he was taking a lot of shots and was nearly the dead last worst 3 point shooter on the team (counting all bench players, yet he took like the 2nd or 3rd most 3s in a game).  He just took a lot of bad shots.  He tried to shoot like Curry, but was the worst at actually getting the ball in the hoop.  Then his defense.....also bad.  And his attitude....also bad.
I lost respect after Poole flashed the money sign right after one of their games.
With the proper guidance, JP was gold man, I dunno what happened to him after "THE PUNCH" lol
Evan Turtle sound like a voice actor for a turtle cartoon.
Draymond should been kicked out the leauge
This aged very well... cp flopped while poole is playing all star level
What's the difference between Buddy Heild and Jordan Poole I'm sure the warriors wish they had Poole instead of Buddy Heild
Poole is happy, starting with no pressure and lazy play plus a huge contract
This segment aged like milk huh Jordan Poole is booty mud level.
Jordan Poole should’ve chilled out. You were the second highest scorer yes, but you were a bus rider. Chill shut up and don’t get big headed. You did too much with the room they gave you. Bro you ain’t them three
I’m still trying to figure out who this “Andre McNabb” is lol. 7:13  Of course i know it’s Donovan McNabb… but it was funny they kept that part in the clip.
4:10 Boogie?
Iggy understands better than anyone that the warriors success comes from a culture of a desire to win. Everybody’s egos go out the door and for the most part, players understand that their stock goes up, even with fewer minutes per game, if their minutes are efficient and the team is winning! Iggy went from averaging the most minutes per game in the league or close to it every year to 6th man getting in 26 minutes a game and he embraced the opportunity! The fans loved him, he was more effective on defense and he was more important and impactful to ensuring a winning team as 6th man than he was starting in a non-competitive system in Philly his whole previous career! Look at guys like JaVale McGee! His minutes hit an all time low. His per game stats stayed about the same but more efficient since it was with fewer minutes in a roll that maximized his strengths. He won two championships and his stock went way up in addition to securing two rings! Steph wasn’t discouraged or demoralized giving up possessions and points to incorporate KD…The goal is to win, and winning brings success to the individual just as much as the team!
That looks like a well practiced superman punch. Draymond really gathered up for that punch. He should have just slapped him.
1:45 Meatwad enters the chat 🏀
Funny the warriors turned to garbage after the punch
And then he went to the Wizzards where he crapped his pants :)))
Lil yachty and this guy sound like they are permanently yawning when they try to talk
This didn't age well. Smdh
Should of kept poolyou can't replace the scoring at cp age with points to assist
"Trying not to try" means you're scared to try.
Jordan Poole was never that good. He was in a great situation to look good with the defense focused on other, better players. He did well in that situation but never developed beyond it.
Dude he was never that good. When you are on a team like the warriors or spurs or thunder they are great at making role players look amazing. Look at Wiggins on the wolves vs on the warriors
Poole cares about his image in front of the crowds and the media. If he humbles himself or he should have let him game do the talking, He tends to show off all the time.
Why does even turner sound like Meatwad 😂😂
As a young player, it doesn’t matter how well you’re doing, you don’t tell 4 hall of famers what to do
CP didn’t help us at all
Evan Turner and Lil Yachty could both talk and I would not be able to tell the difference
after that poole and dray altercation gsw is a mess  even after poole is traded
Man da hate for Jordan Poole is crazy dats y golden state barely made play in dis year
Listening to Andre and JJ talk and hearing this weird frog like voice in the back
Evan Turner sounds just like Lil Yachty
Bro literally out of league
People don’t understand how Steph’s greatness really boosted young fellas delusions and perceptions of how good he actually was 👀👀🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Watching him with the Wizards now, sorry he is inconsistent and GS made the right choice getting rid of him. He's not the future. He got paid, and now this dude scored 11pts in 56 minutes in back to back games. Dude, giving ice spice 500k. Wtf
JP leave that BS behind and create in a different system . Work more with your teammates. We know what you can do. Now what can you help them do.
A lot of word to say nothing in the end. I love you Andre but talk real you are being too nice. We don’t want to hear that
Why is Evan Turner always hanging around Iggy? I am kinda catching the vibe that JJ is going to give them their own podcast (is that what three four two is? I'll Google it after but answer me anyways for the next person lol) but it seems like he has been following Iggy around like Pikachu does to Ash for a minute now. Turner was a stud at Ohio State and was part of the "backpacks are cool resurgence" but dude was so inconsistent and just irrelevant as an NBA player. He made a lot of money and had a cool "point forward" archetype thing going for him for maybe a year or two but definitely not someone anyone out of Ohio State fandom would care for their opinion. He also seems immature and not very sure of himself whenever he talks because he always asks for validation or changes the subject to try and get people laughing. Just overall a weird guy to have for sports media so I'm wondering...... and I am not judging and am totally cool with it......... absolutely supportive if they want to live their lives despite me not wanting to hear him talk but.......are Iggy and Evan Turner a couple????
Jordan Poole handled his situation well in GSW. How would you feel if your team mate ( Green) punches you and the rest of the team  just down played the situation?   Nobody wants to work in a toxic environment.
Iggy needs to be a coach
Turner sounds like lil yachty 😂
He got the bag and changed his style like curry is to the warriors
What the hell are these guys on about?! That was the most confusing, disjointed conversation I've ever had the privilege to hear. LMFAO
Don't care what NONE DEM SAY........... Jordan Poole was the FUTURE....It was all the Future Hall of Famers JOB to get Poole Completely in Step. He was Young AF for Christs Sake!
Bros sound like an alien from star wars
I’m not an analyst, just a lifelong NBA observer. Poole is the victim of ego. Everything he learned and benefited from in San Francisco has gone to his head. Plus, he doesn’t have the same caliber of offensive system to hide in the shadows and get open looks…
Getting real about Jordan Poole would be tellin us what he said lol
Bro sounds like Lil Yachte😂
Turner voice is hard to listen to 😢
Nigga sound like Lil Yachty..
Evan Turner sounds like the old hormone monster from Big Mouth.
Anyone getting these 6400$ ads?
Is it just me or Evan sounds like a robot that has colds 😂
So did I miss the meeting were we agreed Evan turner is lil yahty
I Used to really love Iggy.  I can’t forgive him for selling out the Nuggets, while still on the payroll. I wish you had asked him to explain why he sold us out.
Jordan Poole is hot garbage
This shouldn’t have went this far and for everyone that is saying that Shania should did this are clowns.
Doesn’t look like CP helping too much
Nobody needs to get real about jordan poole. He simply isn't worth it.
lil yatchy had great insight in this podcast
I want to point out one person that might have the same feeling as Jordan Poole.... Kevin Durant.......
I don’t know why commentators continue to blame Jordon Poole for greens awful behavior but I quess this is the world we live in
Turner voice sounds like a teenage giant…🤔😒
Who else thought that was lil tachty talking for a second when dude started talking
2:05 “hes a real human being” what does this mean? steph aint a real human bruh
I'm sure this has been said but Evan Turner lowkey sound like Lil Yachty
C'mon man,,, don't let this man bait you out into the deep waters to nowhere,  Poole is a project to help the warriors,, not cp3, don't be crazy
Sounds like poole was sabotaging the team
This show so 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I can’t watch any other podcast fr
I was surprised he told the truth about how and why Jordan Poole was purposely trying to throw games
He got the bag 💰 and couldn't play up to what was expected.
You’d have thought JJ was getting interviewed 🤦‍♂️
No matter how annoying Evan Turner's voice is....  His takes are usually on point😂
Man i just love andre man you just feel that the brother is genuinely good
He sound like lil yatchy lol
JJ Redick is such an intelligent guy. Such a good podcaster its so entertaining to watch.
Hes a good player shooter etc but he was tryna be steph when theres only one steph like common broo stop tryna be steph and be urself
Poole is a cocky POS and is getting exposed in Washington.
Please more of iguodala, the guy is awesome
Yall talked alot but said nothing…
Poole is still young and has too big an ego but he had a point,Steph,Klay and Draymond are all out of the leauge in 3-5 years, the warriors had the chance to raise poole as the heir to the throne,obviously hes not steph or klay but he could be if they keep him and have him training with them, he was sloppy at times as everyone is, but when hes on hes on,and he could develop into a top 10 player, the fact they threw that away to keep 3 old guys and trade for an even older guy "CP" is crazy,theyre not going to win another chip,its time to start setting up for the future,now theyre going to have to fully rebuild once the big 4 retire,horrible decision making no matter how toxic he was,that was their key to the future and they should have respected that and let him step up
Jordan actually can score way more than Green. They had a pitbull in Poole and didn't want him off the leash. Poole was never going to fit with what the warriors wanted which was Green. I wish Poole the best and hope he puts up numbers to prove himself. Former wolverine so GO BLUE!!!!!
Dude in the middle is annoying
As a Sixers fan Iggy has Always been my Guy and he dishes some hard truths that all us Philadelphian’s can relate to 😂
Andre McNabb loll
Evan turner sound like Kermit on Codeine.
Yeah JP looked like he was on a slip and slide every game. How was he always the only player slipping in games on multiple possessions? Now it makes sense…
It’s a Poole party! He’s the Splash cousin  He’s the new Steph Bwahahaha  Draymomd just did the dirty job for the vets Why does ET sound like he has apple stuck in his throat
Thought Evan Turner was Lil Yatchy when I just heard his voice
I could see prime Kyle Korver or JJ in the warriors 👀 😮😂
JJ is straight garbage. Thought he would be someone different in this lame media world but he fits right into the puzzle. So disappointing too. Another wasted soul.
15 seconds ads is insane work
I know Evan Turner had to be talking about my blazers lol. Terrible on defense terrible on offense but overachieving thanks to Damian Lillard
Damn is that  Evan Turner's real voice😮
Draymond Green was wrong in so many ways for punching him OR ANYONE..I believe Green cost them the season and years earlier cost them a championship..Where does Green think he can do the crap that he does..Kicking someone in the groin---WHAT A LOW LIFE!
His teammates clearly alienated him and took draymonds side. The best thing for the warriors and jordan wouldve been to trade him or draymond immediately.
Just like everyone in San Francisco (almost… not my taxi driver, you were an OG), GSW are transplant diiiiiivaaaaas that think they have more than they actually do. They’d have more success if they weren’t constantly playing Kardashian. Shout out to Oakland and the rest of the country 😂 PS at least in Boston people aren’t pretending they aren’t jerks. Two-faced smartphone nerds, break off into the ocean already
Look chat dray hit sorry suckered punched another man. There is no forgiveness for this and this is wrong. Stop protecting this clown dray cuz he is media as well. You don't put your hands on another period
can someone tell evan to clear his throat
Yo is that black meatwad??
I really think Jordan Poole is a talented player and was a vital piece to winning their ring, but the problem was that the Warriors gave him too much freedom to play the season after they won their championship and he got exposed for it. The more minutes he played, the more he showed his lowlights. From ill-advised shots, snobbing teammates after he got benched, to arguing with Kerr, DG and Steph during timeouts etc. They probably pulled the trigger on trading him knowing that it might probably be a great thought of getting CP3 to be the floor general and Curry to focus more on scoring.  However, I still think trading Poole was too early. He played some good games, some bad games but it wasn't worth just trading him away. Maybe the organization thought the Big 3's time's running out and they don't want to wait for their young talent to mature?
That "trying not to try" quote were genious.
Bro sound like Yatchy😂😂😂😂
Why he steal lil boat voice?
Second on the team in scoring but leading the team in turnovers.  That is not a great ratio.
My issue with Poole is he has false confidence, or over confidence.  You see this when he takes a shot and looks at the opposing bench to mimick Steph but he misses the shot.  Dude don’t start doing crazy stuff until you show great shot making and p,any making for years.
Evan turner sounds like meat wad
Jordan Poole wasn’t t built to run his mouth he should’ve stuck to letting his game speak 😂😂😂he tried to play the 3rd most important man on the team! He thought he was someone he’s not
❤ANDRE GSW FOREVER
Justin Bieber to JP: 'My Steph don't like you but Steph likes everyone'
Well glad to know this was cap
Why Evan Turner's voice look like those glasses are mandatory
Iguodala oozes leadership.
Poole helped contribute to a championship that won him a ring and suddenly his ego got to his head, thinking he could bypass all the dues that the core 3 had given to the franchise. Him telling his mentor, Dray, that he was "one heavy backpack for 30" was out of line and you can tell from the video when nobody came over to stop the fight from happening. Him, Kuminga, Wiseman. All those boys who complained about not getting the green light like Klay and Steph had, not getting the minutes they THINK they deserve, and then go out and be completely garbage is what contributed to all the changes that happened in the offseason.
JP will be out of the NBA in less than 5 years. Attitude issue. Mark this comment
They just didn't like Jordan Poole because he is a great young player, he started outshining Steph and they couldn't control them or hold him back.  So, Poole was ready to rqther than live on the bench. He is too great a player to accept that!
Andre would be a great NBA Head Coach!
Love this podcast & specifically this episode…but buddy kinda sounds like Lil Yachty 😂
Jordan Poole averaged 20.4 PPG but gave up 25 PPG.  His defense was arguably the worst on the team in 2022-2023, especially in the playoffs.  He looked to me like he was purposely missing shots, missing free throws, turning the ball over repeatedly.  I don't care what he DID, I care about what he DO and he wrote his own exit ticket out of San Francisco with what appeared to be purposely tanking to this casual observer.  In addition, what we all don't know and what is equally important is what was he like in the locker room?  Was he loved and wanted or was he hated and "poison".  I think the latter is true.
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yatchy and I can’t unhear it for some reason. Could be just me….
Evan turner sound like lil yatchty
Poole toxic
Here's the reality: Jordan Poole benefited from playing with Steph/Klay/Draymond that he doesn't realize there's no way he gets those "second on the team in scoring" numbers if the other 3 aren't attracting the defense...
Poole thought he had arrived. And when you think you’re at the top? You’ve got nowhere to go but down. He may have put in the work but he didn’t mesh with the team. Draymond recently commented on last year’s chemistry being horseshit. He’s right of course. And Poole was the problem. The Dubs are now 5-1 and 4-0 on the road. Last year they lost their first 18 games on the road. Nuf said.
Hey jj your show is wack
I hate ET’s voice
Why does striped shirt dude sound like Lil Yachty lol
Nice channel- Good content- Also enjoy your game analysis...
I hate the way draymond sets pick n rolls
iggy pretty smart but still got Philly wrong... & yes i get the attempt @ humor
When was Andre Iguodala the best 76ers player in history
He was the third most important on that championship team easily
André hás been the key to the Warriors championship. He is the most underrated player, he is amazing, I put him right under Curry for most impactful player.
5:55 this is big facts applies to all aspects in life.
why he sound like lil yachty
Why doesn't anybody comment on Poole's cringey habit of vogueing to the crowd after buckets, scanning the stands for babes who could be checking him out?
@5:47   "Jordan, it looks like your trying not to try. Do you know how much energy it takes to try to not to try? It takes less energy to try!"   Wowww! Now that's wisdom that you can apply in life. I need this. Thanks Iggy!
Andre mcnabb😂😂
And people still wonder why Draymond punched Poole. Dude was probably acting like a punk, thinking nobody will do anything.
this turner dude has the most anoying voice ever
Why does Evan Turner sound just like lil yachty?
evan “lil yachty” turner
Turner talk like he got teeth behind his teeth
Bro sounds exactly like lil yachty😂
That dude sounds like a frog
remember when andre quit on a team?
The ones who try not to Try lol
CP can’t stay healthy
Ahhh... The former 76ers shooting guards podcast. Lovin' it 😂 Gotta get AI and Maxey on with these guys.
That punch prolly the boiling point for JP. He feels disrespected, overlooked, and for some cases not their best option.   That’s why in ‘22 - ‘23 szn instead of proving that he can take that next step, he’s emotion got the best of him and lose his focus and eventually got traded.   But hey JP now has the freedom that he wants it’s really up to him if he can take off this szn.
So the NBA is like High School. Why doesn't that surprise me?
Why lil boat on the show
IT SOUND LIKE IT WAS SUM REAL HATING INN THA LOCKER ROOM ONN POOLE
Why Iggy talking past Evan Turner like he didn’t play in the league too? Or I’m tripping?
Poole just hit 1-15. He is a great shooter but incosistent and therefore he might end up as a pumped and hyped Ricky Davis.
Evan turner sounds like lumpy space princess
…yeah he’s making since
we will see how much he slips/fall as a Wizards. But, Klay was quite disappointing as well
you need a bigger lense jj the camera switching is such a nuisance😭
Poole just dropped 40 IN THE FIRST HALF. GSW made a huge mistake keeping that fucker Draymond who can barely play ball instead of Poole
First time watching JJs podcast. This is more fun than watching First Take.
Evan Turner sound like Groot and Stitch from Lil and Stitch had a baby.
Hey, does anyone know what was the name of the little rascals that wore braids? I think his name was Farina
1:15 1:36 2:04
Poole is a good player but he messed up the chemistry a lot. He took a lot of shots and missed a lot of shots
wtf is evan turner talking about?
Bro sounds exactly like lil yatchty
Ride that bench talk boy
His take in poole is accurate. He helped them complete the mission which was win a chip. Then they ask him to dial it back. Its the business of basketball, but as a young dude its confusing. What draymond did was unexscusable. Why would I want to play with a dude like that? Hes a fake tough guy. Sneaky fouler with the intentions on seriously hurting people. After he fouled kawhii hard, kawhi let him know how things were going to go down, and draymond left him alone after that.  But, the organization makes money wirh their "big 3". Poole wasnt part of that and was never going to be.
Nah that merman voice is crazy
Evan sound like yachty
When I use to play 2k I always thought Andre and Evan Turner look alike.. now they on a podcast together
I understand the human emotions but the man started falling all over the court played no defense Jordan poole was a different man after that Championship win
JJ and Iggy should 100% have a podcast with the two of them. They have great chemistry.
Evan turner sounds like lil yachty
lmao is that even turner?
Bro it’s because he leaked the video. That’s why no one fucks with him. He leaked the video of the punch
Bro sound like yachty!!😂
What I will miss about JP is his surprising 😮creativity and fearlessness to shoot the winning shot or taking it to the rack… his confidence is his greatest asset… but just not for the Dubs… who grew impatient with him playing hero ball on O but zero ball on D.
Someone has to help liberate Evan Turners voice from his throat 😂
I swore lil yatchy was talking 😭🤣
Ayo Evan clear yo throat
Poole couldn't dial back his ego.  Early on when he would make a tough shot and be grandstanding by sticking his tongue out.....I knew there was an upcoming problem.  Something felt out of sync. Poole will become the entertainer he wants to be in DC......like Harden and the guy who left the Nets for Dallas.  Entertainers are not team players.
Evan sound like yachty 😅
If you got knocked out clean by a 6'6" 230 lb dude, you wouldn't be the same again either 🤷...
Jordan Poole did not fit the Warriors!
Poole did have a lot of floor time 😂
Jordan poole needed a team like the warriors to be the player he is. Now he is going to have to go big or go home on the wizards
homie wanted to be 2016 curry and not many people can be him at times and pool was never that
He was definitely talm bout jimmy lol
Worst story tellers ever. Can I have my 5 min back?
Jordan Poole overestimated his importance to the Warriors.  I bet no Warriors fan shed a tear when he left.
Andre, you da man!!  I love your perspective, and I am so happy you came back to the Warriors.  Love your insight!
Who is the other guy, Evan Turner?
Poole is a bucket...the problem is he is just a bucket. He is literally nothing else.  Not cerebral, no defense, no assist. If the game was just about scoring Poole would be with the best of them. But because he doesn't have the mind to go with it you can't trust him. In GS offense any person that can score easy is going to score a lot. Poole just didn't want to play his role. Now he about to see what life is like as the leading scorer on a subpar team. You want that title you gotta take everything that come along with it.
He’s Harrison Barnes at best, who thinks he’s James harden lol😂
who is this andre mcnabb?
Poole absolutely sucked last year. No team would welcome that complete lack of performance. He has/.had zero leverage while playing that badly.
Jordan Poole plays way too out of control and has an inability to take care of the rock. He’s a turnover machine. His scoring is OK sometimes, he’s great at free throws, but he’s just way too out of control and can’t finish at the rim. Warriors got instantly better when they traded him. Addition by subtraction.
That dude sounds like lil yachty
RIP JP. Go warrior,Here we coming.
The guy in the middle sounds just like Yachty
Y’all made 7 minutes feel like 3 that was a goated vid
Poole was selling the games especially with the most important games
I think they paid him too much too soon, hard to stay hungry when ur full
Evan turner is Yachty
Jordan pool count read the room his an idiot
I thought Evan was lil boat 🛥️
Chris Webber
I thought lil yachty was doing a voice over for Evan turner 😂
I can understand being frustrated with your role changing game to game. Then being the 2nd best at scoring but thats not all there is to a team. His ego wouldn't let him be the bigger person. News flash in any job there are favorites who get away with everything, and the role players who have to follow the rules. Sucks but thats life.
Lil yachty with the voiceover 😮
When Steph Curry, one of the chillest teammate that you could have on the entire NBA, is getting angry and frustrated at you, it is a big sign that there is indeed a problem.  I was also defending Jordan Poole at first, and was also mad at GSW for giving a light punishment for Draymond, but when I watched that game where Curry was reprimanding Poole and Poole just brushed it off, I immediately changed my mind. Thats just very disrespectful to your leader, especially since Curry treated JP very nicely. Its unfortunate that GSW didnt give a proper statement on the Poole vs Draymond incident, but I guess there is a legit reason why they only give a light punishment to Draymond. Looking back at the clip where DG sucker punched Poole, the teammates were really just IDGAF. Hell, Wiggins was the nearest player to them and still late to react. I think this is a telltale sign that JP really isn't innocent, and probably even instigated the whole event.
5:50 "do you know how much energy it takes to try not to try" I actually don't.
Warriors gota chill on the poole slander. I dont think he is as bad as we saw him last year. Warriors couldnt have got a ring without him 2 years ago. And i feel he threw his second season away after seeing the teams loyalty jump on draymonds side after the punch. Both sides have their truth but warriors too need to realize that ring wasnt won without poole that year. He was clutch for them.
Not gonna lie but even Turner voice makes me have to clear my throat
JP can ball
CURRY&THOMPSON worked extra hard 4those shots and dude just felt overly ____________ entitled & showed bad shoot selection
ETs definitely talking about my Portland Trailblazers.  😂
draymond green is NOT THAT GUY, thats all im gonna say..
Nice
Nice
good
Nice one
I love discussion
That boy sound more like lil boat than lil yachty does
Nice
1:48 this take on Jordan Poole 100% confirms everything I suspected when I watched him on the court. And ironic thing is that he is not smart enough to be a winner when he is given freedom. He didn’t recognize that he only did well before because he played within the system.   Smart defenders literally happy to go to Poole Island and bait him into doing the same mistakes.   Poole thinks that he is the 2nd leading scorer because he was 2nd best player, when the reality is that he was 2nd leading scorer because opponents picked him as their poison.
yo Evan Turner wilds out for real love this dude commentary
You lost me when Evan Turner spoke.
Evan turner has a weird voice
When Evan turner started speaking I had to check my phone I thought that was lil yachty
Why should I be the guy ?? Bro so we can continue to win championships 🤦🏿‍♂️
Nice
Very good
IS THAT MEATWAD TALKING????
This about poole or the sixers?
Evan Turner can u just say "lil boat" 😂😂😂
I don’t know anybody that can stay in front of lou Williams how can lou Williams not stay in front of nobody 😂😂😂😂
In the end, Poole’s ego was his undoing. He had to go!
Good
Jordan Poole was the only person that I know that would turn the ball over without the defense around him.   Like he has baby hands.
Let’s keep it real Draymond and Klay thompson could not deal with Jordan Poole becoming a major part of the story. They sabotaged him all last year
Didn’t know lil Yachty played in the nba
There should be NO PLACE for violence in workplace. But hey - lets just ignore it.
He wanted to be that guy so quickly
They forget Poole he’s star,only cause they one of the best dynasty in history with 4 rings,the forgets Poole gave them one ring so he has one ring but if helps u like that number in pts after Steph, that means a lot. They did dumb thing about trade him to old men, cp3 will have them 15pts when Poole gave them 21+, now Steph need to play harder. And y’all know if Poole was in every another team he always gonna start.
Nice
The trying not to part was my favorite quote in this 😂😅
The trying not to part was my favorite quote in this 😂😅
Bruh sound like meatwad
👍
Beautiful ❤❤
This profession is very important for success.
Hello dear friends how are not the last email to me and I am doing good and you are going
very nice
Harrison Barnes did it better
Shoulda traded Klay and kept Jordan Poole
Dude wit the glasses sound like meatwad😂😂😂
Why does Evan Turner sound like Yachty 😂
Poole was a lot more smooth and efficient before. He started playing as if he was the only player on the court. He would make five or six moves with no one guarding him.
Klay averaged more ppg 😂
Whenever I want to have a good laugh one of the things I do is go look at the list of stats of all fmvps in history iguodala 7/3/3  what happened 😂
is that evan turner  😂😂?
They talk about this like it isn’t predetermined
How u gon speak on Poole not wanting to play defense when Steph does it all da time...hell 80% of the league don't play defense
Good
Excellant this video i really respect you guys and your constributions to basketball  a good luck 👍
Jordan Poole has one more ring than Barkley and Stockton and Westbrook!
He is rough understanding what it takes to win makes you know what are the sacrifices needed to win
Nice
During the championship celebration, Poole was going on about getting his bag, so the punch didn't really surprise me as he probably deserved it. I think he's selfish and immature and I'll be surprised if he wins another ring. I'm glad he's gone.
Why Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty tho
Poole had the 4th most turnovers last season. If we compared his total minutes per turnover, to Trae Young, Edwards, and Westbrook who have higher turnovers. I think he would top the list. (him and westbrick are actually close in turnover per minute played. But Westbrook has higher apg, rpg, spg, and bpg than Poole.
Nice video 👍
😎😎😎
Evan Turner sound like Lil Yatchy when he talk
I'm keeping Jordan Poole and trading Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Those 2 guys are washed up. There's plenty of quality players around the league that can fill their roles.
1:46 dude came out of nowhere
👍
Evan turner sound like lil yachty😂😂
Its kind of sad cause if you look at klay he def sacrifices and curry took a back seat to KD so its part of that team culture so they wasnt telling poole wrong but it was the right thing to do if he wanted to shine more
Evan turner sounds like lil yachty lol
After being embarrassed and emasculated for the world 🌎 to see and the team supporting Draymond what did we expect? 🤷‍♂️  Right or wrong.
Steph is one of the worst defending point guards ever, how are they mentioning Poole? his defense can’t be much worse than Steph come on
Close you’re eyes and I swear it’s lil yachty sittin there with JJ and Andre.
Turner sound like a sophisticated frog
5:50 i don't fckin understand wym iggy ?!
Andre McNabb
Andre pretty much saying some  NBA dudes act like bitches.
"I could Have a JJ reddick in me" Was Wild ⏸️
the HOF to the guy on the bench just HAD to be KD to Swaggy P 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Supet i like❤❤❤
Even turner sounds like lil yachty!
a million views in 4 days. JJs pod is phenomenal
Philly was my first team I fucked wit and when iggy got traded I was done still watched them lil bit
Evan Turner def should talk less with that voice
The draymonds punch had a mental effect on jpoole but its not that much. Poole's performance on the championship run made coaches be aware of him. The lakers scouted him well and found out his court habits and tendencies and made him fumble the ball everytime.
When it comes to the freedom part of the conversation, do you think Poole's overall contribution to the team is a) deserved of said freedom he wants, and b)would him having that freedom play out as a positive or negative for the TEAM?
Father bros money él Hefeweizen fo
Poole came into camp with extra inflated head and was coming at the vets in disrespectful ways. That's what led to the punch. It's like a 18yo young man learning how to interact with grown men as men.
I can't wait for Klay Thompson to be washed for another year so they can regret this move. Klay is done, he's slumping, he's not the same guy and that Warriors core is definitely buddy ball.
You gotta punch back... even if it's a cheap shot a day later you can't let that go.
Why Evan Turner sounds like yachty
I was only listening and I was like damn lil boat knows about the Warriors
Evan turner got lil yatchy’s voice 😂🎉
Evan turner voice sound like eating saw dust and talking with your mouth open
Evan Turner = Big Yachty
Andre Mcnabb?????!?!
Three of you have a chemistry you should let ride out a few more episodes.
In all fairness McNabb was loved by Philly fans up until it became clear he couldn’t win a Super Bowl. Plus the beef with TO didn’t help bc TO played that SB with a broken leg while McNabb was throwing up in the huddle
Evan Turner high af
A takeaway I have from this podcast is when they're talking abt Poole after winning the ring, questioning "why don't I get freedom like that? I'm proven already." That's the issue there. Jordan balled out in the 2021-22 season, but I remember he even regressed a bit back then, when klay came back into the rotation. Like I said, he did ball out that season, he did come up big plenty of times in the playoffs, and earned his bag. I think him getting that bag probably meant to him, that he was now gonna get the same treatment as Steph. Once he seen that wasn't the case, the attitude showed.  Now I get Jordan's frustrations. He's young and hungry. Steph's spot on the gsw throne at that time had Jordan poole's name reserved to sit next on it. Had Jordan kept up the work ethic and been a key role player like he was in 2022, the dynasty run coulda continued, and Poole coulda slowly and respectfully nudge out one of the splash bros in the starting and closing spots.
This is a very unnecessary comment...  Evan Turner sounds like a matured Lil Yachty. ⛵😂
Nice
Nice
2:02 I didn’t know he was second in scoring😮
Why dude in the middle sounding like lil yachty 😂😂😂😂
jordan poole, got scouted, plain and simple  its whar separates greats from pretenders
Good
Good
Obviously jordan poole manipulated his way out of the Bay.🎉
I tried to watch almost every game last season and I did watch every single one in the playoffs. Poole's lack of effort and his attitude were palpable. That kind of mindset is toxic for a team. Punched by Draymond or not (and I would not be surprised if his attitude was the reason for the punch to begin with), I am glad he is gone DESPITE how incredible he was in the 21-22 playoffs.
warriors so fucked i love it
Good
Jordan Poole just wants to score and make highlights....that's all.  Maybe I've soured on him after last year...because I did have high, high hopes for his play the year before.  He was excellent.  This past year, he was hot garbage.  Sloppy dribbling and bad passes(when he attempted).  I don't get Evan Turners point of him constantly saying "he's 2nd in scoring"....like that's huge deal in the NBA.  There's lot of 20pt scorers in the league....given they're allowed to shoot freely as Poole was.  It was hard to for anyone else to score while Poole was playing.
Correct. 😂
How many years of legacy does each championship give you because everybody talks about the Warriors like they've been good forever
Much respect for Andre but, he tip toes around the elephant in the room. The affects of DG's punch and the lack of disciplinary action by the GSW towards DG set the wheels in motion for that team to underachieve, and JP's or Green's departure. GSW chose to keep the troublemaker. I hope JP lights them up when they play each other, so the GSW realizes they chose a bully over their future.
Yo Evan turner voice don't match him!!😂😂
Mine (best quote) was" he knows im his brother & love him" (b4 he starts a joke session on poole)..but he let his brother be suckerpunch to the floor & you did nothing..thats my best part its shows why Poole was f'd up. He kisses so much azz on that team he needs chap stick & and a lot for his big liying lipps.
why dude sound like lil yacty😂
Bro sound like lil boat
Oh shut up JJ 👎 As a lesser role-player your comments or opinions carry no weight 👎 Pat Beverley makes more sense than you 😂
Talking to one guy versus another. What is that? That sounds like some female stuff. That’s crazy. Play the game on both ends. This is a game that they love to play.
Andre is such a good basketball conversationalist.
I ain’t gonna lie I hate Evan Turners voice, dude sound like he can’t breathe thru his nose
Gilbert Arenas said it too and other players that after break you win a ring the young players start feeling themselves too much.   2nd year and 3rd year players the most
Ya I lost brain cells listening to Iggy
He wasn’t the second leading scorer that was klay
It sounds like Steph didn’t want him scoring too much and Klay was upset with Poole outshining him
Even Turners the grandson of Chewbacca
it’s safe to say J.Poole’s not winning anymore titles in his career lol 😂 😂
Evan turner sound like lil yatchy
Nah, not playing well because he got sucker punched by his trusted mentor is a bad excuse, Curry literally got the side eye on a lot of people, including coaches, gms, scouts and even fans, saying he won't cut it, he's too small, he won't make the big league etc etc, but look where he is now, through hard work and not letting those opinions about him get to him, JP is not like that, he lets those thoughts get to him, and he was tripping even before he got punched, tbat's a bad excuse, i've seen the Warriors games, and he makes more mistakes, and irrational plays and decision, he's a sometimes okay but sometimes frustrating player to watch, it's not only Draymond, but also Steph, Klay and even Kerr, who had something to say about him, that was the first time i've seen Steph get mad and got ejected, again man, what Draymond did was bad, but if JP was running his mouth, trying to make himself look big then he got what was coming too, thjng here is, if Dray and JP were normal people, y'all wouldn't make a big fuss about it, but since they NBA players, and popular, everybody be making a big deal out of it, fights always happens, and big fights usually make great relationship, the way JP handled it was his own decision, and ofc nobody believes Dray's apology just because he punched him, but oh well, good riddance I guess, I loved JP, especially with the light skinned rizz memes, but the amount of mistakes I have seen him do outweighs those memes, and it is definitely not pleasant, wish him all the best in Washington though
i forgot who evan turner was. he was really outside at one point
Evan turner sounds like lil' yachty
If you are not a professional in adversity then you are not a professional - Enjoy Washington. Go Dubs.
Bruh every time I look away frm the screen I keep thinkin..  Why is lil yachty talkin basketball wit hall of famers 🤣😂🤣😂
i’m sorry but cream sweater dude voice is annoying
Evan Turner sound like Lil yachty
turners voice sound like he under water
🐐🐐🐐
Old Man and the Sea painting, love it
Evan Turner is a real one. Is he a guest or is he co-hosting this podcast now?
Being to hard and critical  on a young player hes going to get you back soon
4:10 lol NBA HOF is a joke role player damn near everyone makes it know NFL HOF is dif
"J.J. Ridick in me"😬 PAUSE IGGY
PRAYING JP, has a GREAT (ALL STAR) caliber season 🙏   Warriors DO NOT WIN that last 🏆WITHOUT Poole Time🧏🏾‍♂️🎯
Evan Sound Like Lil Yachty 😂
Good
good
He was always falling
Andre has so much wisdom, that’s why he was so valuable to the warriors
Even Turner sound suspect
Wait didn’t Jordan Poole get molested by Eric Bledsoe ?
That’s crazy Evan Turner sounds EXACTLY like Lil Yatchy 😂😂😂
Lil yaughty?
Damn I ain’t know Evan turner sounded like a Sesame Street monster.
This is why this year is interesting. People think the warriors magically became bad on defense lol. I dont think the game will be called the same this year. They will he more organized on offense and defense.  I think the league fell asleep on the warriors.
a lot of the stories i hear from NBA players just consistently confirm to me that a lot of these dudes have just never really had to grow up lol
That’s the problem though when you a young man and you ballin you can’t really tell him nothing. People who have their ego in check would be able to recognize and play their position but there was no space for that on the warriors. I can’t really blame Jordan bc again he’s young , but me personally regardless of age I’ve always been able to play my position. All these niggas wanna be king and you have to check yourself at times if you want to thrive as a team
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!
Evan turner and lil yachty has the same voice
Evan turner sound like he talking with voice box
Idk ab anyone else but for me klay came back and immediately flopped the past two seasons he wasn’t the same and arguably you could say Poole should’ve started over him
This clip was all over the place
Man Andre saying a whole bunch of NOTHING 😂
🛸👽🕳️
wait, this is my first time listening to JJ. I thought you proclaimed Christ yet just a minute in you're cursing, dropping F-bombs??  come on, now.
They shoulda traded Klay for CP3 fr you’ll see
This 🥷 sound like Lil boat 😂😂😂
I really respect you guys and your contributions to basketball. I am not sure how JP will do in Washington without Klay and Steph spacing the floor. Regardless of the freedom that the Big 3 has, they were disciplined first or before the freedom. That freedom is slightly built off of that discipline or structure. I like JP but i felt that he was often out of control when he was frustrated resulting in TO's and poor decisions. At times I also felt that he was getting caught up in the hype / limelight resulting team breakdowns. I think he could be great, but I feel a lot will have to do with his maturity and growth from this point on. Also, he will not be at the Warriors organization which is going to be a different experience. It reminds me of Bynum leaving the Lakers. Bynum never played for another organization on the Laker's level.
Why is Evan Turner chiming in 😂😂😂
Y’all know Poole was done dirty ion even like the warriors but y’all know poole was like that and I think that was issue because he was doin sum things like Steph and Klay did and they know he had a case to do some things they did
There's always quote  You feeling your self  Means you feeling your self forget to humble and the team non existence.....
The other guy talks to much
Poole gonna be a problem this year watch
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty. I can’t unhear it.😂
Ask him about how he still has PTSD from THE block
LTMFB!!
Evan the team was shitty you was on because of you mostly stop it..
Evan turner lowkey sound like lil yachty
Keep going
Poole is going to average 23-26 P0G this season but not with much else on a 30-40 win wizards team. Likely all star but doesn't mean he can lead or be a winner.
Listen Jordan Poole is a JR Smith and a John Starks. The mf is the biggest finesser in history.
Let’s set the horrid defense Poole plays aside, offensively he’s a huge liability and an asset to the other team.  He dribbled around aimlessly hunting for his shot, and just gets into trouble, putting up garbage that misses.  He was given freedom offensively, and he abused it so badly they had to take it away
Well, only time can tell after Poole playing in Washington.
Steph wasn’t a good leader about that Draymond incident. He took a side and now that’s going to cost y’all. I wouldn’t have played hard for y’all after that either. Y’all showed y’all didn’t value Jordan at all. If your not apart of that original winning group they will isolate you . They not about to tell draymond he was wrong . Lol and that’s the bullshit. So now everyone is separated that’s cool . I hope Jordan has a chip on his shoulder and goes at all of y’all ALL YEAR. Because y’all weren’t acting like his teammates y’all were acting like OPPS.
Dude sound like “stitch” from Disney
After Jordan Poole got knocked out, the whole team sided with Draymond. His bad performance during the playoffs was done on purpose. He wanted to get traded.
My guy in the middle needs a bottle of mucinex
Evan sounds like he just got kicked in the nuts 24/7
We are here to hear the truth
jordan looked drunk at times, and the refs really had an axe to grind with the ball overs. smoke and fire, ppl in the nba  don't like the kid
No wonder Iggy has a high IQ. The guy is smart. On point. Fun to listen to. The veteran presence that every team needs.
Thank you, as usual, for standing up on this point. #podcast
Always nice to hear from Iggy.
Im listening to this while doing hw n i dead heard turner n thought "why tf lil yachty on this podcast"
Bro sounds like the koala from lilo and stitch
Draymond clearer is insecure with the young players gs have. He dont want to mentor them, he clearly wants to push them away to keep his job. Notice he dont have a relationship with kuminga cause if he teaches him the tricks gs might ship draymond and start kuminga in the future.
Why is Evan turner on this
Who invited Kermit the frog on the podcast 🐸
JJ, keep them both. Y'all's chemistry is crazy! And it's so informative!
Iggy is funny as hell yo
Bro i hate this dudes voice its weird 🤦🏾‍♂️
Has anyone said yet that Evan Turner sounds like a Simpsons character?…
I swear Andre voice been through a mandela effect or some sht. Didn’t he use to sound like he just did helium?😂
Evan turner has lil yachty speaking for him 😂
Evan Turner sounds like Stitch I can’t unhear it
ET talking that talk
Poole just needed to stick with the team game. He’s usually selfish.
Best thing to happen in warrior history is that Draymond Green does not trust his teammates on defense in clutch moments.
I was waiting for a point to be made then the video just ended… lmao
I hate this niggas voice.
hey man evan turner talkin like the truth bro!!! all good and humping but sometimes you gotta listen to the old dudes!!! that played it!!!! its like wtf
Evan Turner sounds like meatwad
This is the first time I've heard Iggy speak at length in this kind of setting and I gotta say, I love his personality.
For as much as you talk about philadelphia you would think you had more good things to say about the city .
Curry said that whoever doesn't want to play their roll and believe in the process to sit back.
Bro in the middle sound like MeatWad
I think looney is a core member as well
Is someone going to tell Iggy that Poole got traded, CP3 aint helping him 😂
Not basketball related at all, but why does Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty. HaHa.
Dude gotta have the most annoying voice ever
Draymond chased Durant out and then alienated the up and comers.  Kerr admitted he couldn’t control Dray, and failed to protect Poole, bring Kuminga along, and start facing the future. It’s downhill from here for the Dubs.
Poole was better as a rookie than JJ was at his prime...
Sea quien hable siempre van a disfrutar cuando dicen cosas malas y se van alegrar de todo lo malo que le pase a Jordan Poole si alguien sale de ahí nunca le van a desear que le vaya bien y Andre lo termino de sepultar
Not for nothing Andre Igoudala is and has been one of my favorite people in the nba. Aside from him being an underrated monster in his prime he’s incredibly humble, a great locker room guy/ leader (according to ppl that have played with him) then on top of that he’s very candid and objective when he’s on podcasts. Not many people can walk the fine line of a harsh and open criticism all while keeping it completely professional/ respectful and iggy is definitely one of the few. If he chooses so, he’s going to have a great sport media career
How many turnovers did donkey have
Wizards vs Warriors is circle on my calendar for sure.....
It's crazy how everyone wants poole to care when he was in a Toxic environment.The warriors have their cliques so He was an outsider on his own team.
JJ is like "was it that funny? Damn" 4:20
This guys S's are super prevalent. Super sharp and crisp. 😐
Evan Tuner sounds like Lil Yatchy 😭
poole, no defense. butterfingers, turnovers, slipping and sliding all over the fall. besides the defense which is effort, there was something mental going on because the previous year he won us some games. regressing to the mean?
Turner sounds like Stitch mixed with Lil Yatchty 😭💀
4:09 probably jimmy butler
Nah word to i never Hurd Evan Turner speak 😭😭
Bro voice is disgusting. Boy sound like a sesame Street character 😂 I bet females be mad when he tries to holla
Draymond did ko him tbf
So what we saw was is basically what most people especially the ones that actually play ball he was sabotaging the team because he thought he was Klay Steph status after one good season.
I always forget that Evan Turners voice is that ridiculous until I hear him speak. Sounds like a muppet.
2:45 he’s definitely talking about the blazers
Bet so its time Wizards Rise
His VOICE 😢😢
Evan turner sounds like Lil yachty
These dudes will check Jordan but scared too check draymond 😂😂😂
BLACKS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH
Why does Evan Turner sound like he was born with a cold 😂
JJ why have Evan Turner on the podcast??? He's clearly not smart nor on the same level with you and Iggy
I thought Yachty was on here at first.
Andre's eye roll says it all.
For sure it was Boogie who said "I'd beat your a**"
Well, now Poole has a chance to show us if he's really that good or did he benefit from the warriors system and playing with Steph.
We was cooked from the beginning I fear 😫
I was just listening n not looking, I thought lil yachty was on here
Y’all can’t tell me Evan Turner doesn’t sound like Lil Yachty or Meat Wad
05:48    straight facts!!
Evan turner sound like yachty
Andre looking at this dude like dude you have pearls on.
Draymond 2-0 at getting players outta GSW. KD now Poole
Evan Turner's voice always throws me.
Who is this lizard with iggy and jj
Why is Evan Turner on this podcast smh
Power Ranger episode https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1oodSbHb96E
Andre is trying his best not to bash Poole,go ahead just say the guy is talented, he belongs in the league but nobody likes him.
Jesus loves you all, repent and receive the kingdom of heaven 🙏
Evan turner sounds like what I imagine an alien would sound like😢😂
Andre McNabb 🔥🔥🔥
Wouldn't be suprised if Poole isn't in the league 5yrs from now...
Evan turner and lil yachty gotta be brothers by voice
even turner should never speak again. horrible voice
The man single handedly sank the Warriors. Idc what happened to you, it can’t affect your business. He stopped being professional. He played like dirt. And was arrogant on top of it all. Idek how he made it through that season w/o being traded. I’m just thankful that he’s someone else’s problem now  ✌🏾🏌🏾‍♂️🏌🏾‍♂️
Dang! I was really into the video and it seems like it ended too soon. This conversation was so good! 😄
Jordan Poole=Rondo to the celtics big 3 Draymond Green does NOT= Kevin Garnett
Evan turner voice is wild annoying
Jordan Poole has been better than Donkey Green for a long time. Donkey Draymond is the most over rated player in the NBA. He had more fouls than points or assists in a Finals game.
shoutout Lanphier High School
Just now realized Evan Turner sounds exactly like Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Bruh a thought lil boat was up here talking about some ball 😂
I’m glad Andre called out Jordan Poole defense cause I was watching games live yelling at the tv watching Jordan Poole play defense he literally was playing like he didn’t want to be on the warriors no more so ion understand why people feel bad for em
Tbh they gave him too much money to early they didn’t even do that for Steph and them that early in they career
Evan turner sounds like pat mahomes & lil yachty
What is Evan Turner doing on here? I step away for a few weeks and what's going? He doesn't have a podcast voice. Sounds like a turtle filter, no disrespect but you know what I mean? Is he co-host now?
Can’t help but wonder how much this mirrors Kawhi in San Antonio. I know there were differences over injury management, but did KL feel like he wasn’t getting fair treatment for lifting three future HOFers to their last chip? I don’t think the warriors miss out on championships with JP gone, but what about the Spurs without KL? Don’t mean to pull attention from this story, but it is easy to lose sleep when thinking about the ways that winning a championship can create an identity crisis for a team’s ‘core’ players
Do you Know how Much Energy it take to "Try Not to Try??" .....That ladies & gentlemen is Jordan Poole's last season in GSW in a Nutshell
Bottom line: to play with the warrior big 3 you have to take a role. Usually they get players on the downslope of their career who are willing and able to play their role. Poole just happened to be the one guy (so far) who was young and succeeded in a role. Problem was, he wasn’t on the downswing; he’s on an upward trajectory and grew beyond just a role. Sounds like warriors were promising him he’s be next but timing expectations were off … they wanted him to stay in his role and wait for things to progress with time and age …  he wanted to start the transition right away. We see which side won out.
I WANT IGUODALA 🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Dubs will regret letting Poole go. They should have traded Green, Curry and Thompson while they still have trade value and get pieces to build around Poole. Come to think of it, his First Name is Jordan. You don't just trade someone with a Jordan First Name, that is worth, like, 12 LeBrons. Man, the Dubs made a bad decision replacing Poole with Paul. Doesn't Paul loathe the Warriors? At least get a preseason video version of Ben Simmons for a generational talent like Poole.
he started to become corny afyer he became a champiin..ja morant is mad corny even with out winning a champuonship🤣
Even Turner beyond sounding like he has gills for lungs is always crying and never taking accountability for his own career. Pal YOU were the epitome of a losing player. YOU sucked on defense, YOU couldn't pass, YOU couldn't stretch the floor which would have extended your career or made you desirable to contenders. Hate listening to him speak always pointing the finger like he was so above the situations he was in and just smarter than everyone else.
Marlon Wayans lil bro in the middle got a damn turbocharged V8 in his throat 😂
So is tommy only on some episodes ?
Is lil yatchy doing a voice over or sum😅
Rocket league Better ong  https://youtu.be/uM09jxTIltM?si=RTuRE63BpSuvMM01
Pooles 285 turnover was enough
All the hate on Poole in the comments yes he was horrible in the playoffs this year but he helped them win a championship last against the Celtics a key factor in that Celtics series but he still does need improvement
Evan Turner voice is really something🧐😂💯
Lol who said Evan turner sound like lil yachty im weak
Andre said bingo fast af 😂 1:03
Evan Turner sound like Kermit the frog 😂😂
JP needed to wait his turn. He had next after the Steph era 😢
When people say “the Draymond punch affected Jordan Poole” what they they are missing is that it is effected him mentally, not psychologically. Like Draymond punched him and he passed out. And he woke up, he had lost IQ points. Like he was a slower person mentally, afterwards.
Iggy is a snake for coming on this podcast and trashing JP. Even if what he is saying is true there is no denying that Draymond punching Poole + the GSW org not doing anything about it + using JP as a scapegoat when they lost was not cool at all.   JP not the only one who should be getting the blame but that’s what’s been happening constantly…..
Evan turner have rat energy
Draymond has sabotaged the warriors in every championship run they had.
evan turner saying klay trying to be the leading scorer 😂😂😂
Evan Turner sounds like a lil yachty AI or something
LMFAOOOOO funniest 7 mins of this podcast ever
1 of these guys needs to come out of the closet, I’ll let you all guess who I’m referring to.
Why does this dude Evan turner sound Jar Jar binks
I think pool is a victim of just being disliked as a person, you know that one kid we never liked no matter what they did, they could bring cookies for the whole class and niggas just be hating😂😂,yeah thats Pool
Dude is lil yahchty?
I need mans to say “Poland too wok the took I” backwards right this instant
Evan with her mom's necklace
I'm new to this channel. Evan Turner sounds like a deeper Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
The thing about CP is that he’s a great leader and he makes plays when you really need a bucket.   I’d say he’s a better leader than Steph for certain and par with Draymond. You need that kind of dawg to make the clutch plays and the buckets down the stretch, no matter how fragile he maybe in the post season or all the questions about his defence. It’s the same chemistry as a Lebron and Rondo that bring together, having CP3 is basically having a coach playing in the game.
Evan Turner = Lil Yatchty 👀👀👀
Dang Lil Yachty over here third-wheeling the hell of out of that convo 😂😂
Good show but this is supposed be unfiltered.  Too much "this guy" "a team I played on" "this certain player" "someone I played with" etc. Need no secrets type pod.
nigga Evan Turner sound like lil yachty
Evan Turners voice is aggravating af sound like kermit the frog😂
What's up JJ, keep on keeping on 👋👍
Jj replaced the white guy😂
Was that Evan Turner ?
Nice take on the Javale McGee situation 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Iggy talking about Elton Brand
It’s Lance Stephenson’s son Evan Turner. It’s been a while since I heard about this dude
Yo why even turner sounds like lil yachty  😂😂😂😂, Great video. Also I don't know who needs this, but I'd like to bless anyone since you've blessed me. Jesus christ loves you and gave his life on the cross so we could live and have a relationship with god. All we have to do is recognize our sins and ask for forgiveness and believe in jesus christ his son.
GSW should have benched Klay since he struggles to play lots of quality minutes after his injury and trade Dray for some depth.
Effort is the one that got away from Poole. They let Draymond unpunished and you can see in the antics of Poole that he is a mess. He will be ok in Washington.
ahh the snake is on the podcast
In the Warrior organization's point of view, the main point is about "are you really the future of the team"?. J Poole has proven himself to be a valuable piece of the team but has he proven himself to be "the future of the team"? The clear answer is unfortunately no. The Warrior organization saw him as a no, and the players also saw him as a no.
Poole was worth $15 mill max yearly. The $125mill deal was almost as bad as the Gobert contract.
Tell Turner, his Marve the Martian sound can be fixed. It’s a tongue tension issue. I’m a basketball nerd gym rat but got my masters in voice. This cat is struggling producing strong vocal sounds because he’s squeezing the base of his tongue. It’s like fingernails on the chalkboard.
1 hit wonder regression
Evan turner voice bro.. got dam..
while it was frustrating to watch him play defense and I completely understand what iggy is saying I can’t blame jordan for completely checking out mentally. they did him dirty since the preseason and I hope he lights it up in DC.
evan turner is lil yachty
Never knew Evan Turner and Yachty shared voices til today
Yachty is Turner, Turner is Yachty.
I want iguodala - max
Evan sounds like he’s underwater. Luv the guy tho
Worries handled the 🤛🏾 really bad and it messed up JP psychology. End of story  Not that hard to understand
Jordan pool is trash and will never get a ring again
I keep getting distracted by Michael Myers in the painting 😅
Jordan Poole just play basketball recklessly 😮
Lol I think Andre was definitely talking about Melo in Denver
Steph Curry doesn't have a finals MVP without Jordan Poole.
Jordan poole soft if you talk crap be ready to fight 😂😂
Draymond trash not gonna lie
Evan turner sound just like lil yachty
Turner turned high pitch 😂
Honey I see you looking at me
Lil boat
Poole is gonna be able to do whatever he can do in DC now
Why would I care about the opinion of the guy that seemingly didn't even try against the Warriors in the playoffs just to join them immediately after? Dude was a bandwagon player before it was trendy
Anytime Evan Turner starts talking I just cringe.
Evans voice is horrible
Evan turner sounds like lil yatchy wtf lol
E.T talking about his time with the Blazers lol. I know it.
I think Jordan Poole got cocky. It’s probably the reason why Draymond punched him. Warriors paid him a bag to emulate the same performance during that championship run and he basically tried to step out that role and did whatever tf he wanted
https://youtu.be/GyqlIwJLML0?si=olANZviDj2naqGWe
lil Yachty
d. green sucks
Why does Evan Turner sound like Meatwad 😩
Had to stop watching once jabba the hut voice started
WHEN YOU ASK FOR SUCH ROLE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE  PLAY WELL IF NOT THEN YOU WILL BE A HINDRANCE FOR THE TEAM. HE WASNT GETTING A GOOD PERCENTAGE SHOTS PEOPLE WANTS TO PINPOINT STATS BUT DOESNT PINPOINT FGOAL PERCENTAGE ON HIS LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE. I DONT KNOW WHY THIS IS BEING BLIND EYE TO KEEP IT GOOD.  PPG ISNT WHAT SHOULD BE THE ONLY THING TO BE LOOK AT IN THE STAT SHEET.JUST SAYING
Why does Evan Turner sound like lil Yachty ??
That nigga sound like yachty
Poole and Kuzma are the Wizards best players, Last year it was Beal, Kuzma, and Porzingis and they were the 12th seed. Poole isn't even close to Beal, and they just straight lost Porzingis. They're fucked lol.
Klay was the second on team in scoring in 21-22 , 22-23
“It takes less energy to try”  😂😂😂
After the punching, I became a fan of JP. All star wizard Poole party ready💪 💪
Poole wasn't hunted enough in their championship run and thats why he looked great
Both poole and draymond are liabilities at some aspects of warriors game. Poole was just a bigger one imo
*cough *cough Klay Thompson
Happy to hear from you guys 🏀 such wisdom
The petulant child has moved on to his own team. I wish him well.
Evan Turner sounds like something is stuck lodged in his throat. he sounded congested too
Bro sounds like lil yachty
Evan turner just wanna be included
He sounds like lil yahtchy 😂💀💀💀💀
gah damn every time Evan talk i gotta make sure Yachty didn’t make a guest appearance
It takes less effort to try. That's damn true.
This was great.
I actually glad that JP traded to Wizards, last year JP in the situation that no matter how good he played, he still cannot start cause Kerr just going start Klay over him due to his past glory. Klay shot 3/19 but Kerr had no issue and still let him keep shooting. Draymond made dumb pass that cost the game, Kerr had no issue. This Warriors culture just not as good as people thought. Who else these vets going to blame if they still get out second round.🤔
Anyone got an Id on that hat iggy is rocking?
damn andre cunningham is how i think of you
So true about Lou lol this why Raptors didn't even blink twice to resign him in 15-16
I hate that I can't focus every time Evan Turner talks because he sounds like Kermit the frog, lmao
He was hard done by, but also brought some of it on himself.
The Poole trade will be the worst trade in history when we look back at it
The organization were the cause of JP downfall
why would you listen to these guys, janitors all
I've never watched a professional ball player slip as many times as JP, and I'm not even exaggerating. If you watched enough Warrior games, you'd know Jordan Poole slipping and losing the ball in a game is almost as certain as death and taxes.
LoL "How can no one stay in front of Williams but Williams can't stay in front of anybody".
Where is the co host
I need that shirt iggy
The guy with glasses sounded like Lil Yatchy
Evan Turner sound like Desiigner
I love discussions like this because these are players not very far removed from the league. Because I remember when JJ finally talked about his thoughts on tge Draymond punch to Poole, and JJ thought it looked like a young player who got paid and didn't want to put in the work and got checked for by a veteran. Right or wrong it's so interesting to hear these thoughts on players  from guys just out of the league.
The fact is Draymond knew his value because he connects well with Steph, where the latter depends on Dray to feed him. The dubs are definitely gonna choose Dray over anyone else just to keep Steph productive
Very interesting vantage points..... good stuff.  Makes Jordan more human and more difficult to judge him
Can’t get over the fact Evan Turner sounds like lil Yachty
The NBA is the only job in the world where you can knock a co worker out in front of everybody, still keep your job...just saying
The best player was Iverson bro. Who told him he was the best in Philly ever? Even Barkley has talks.
Does Evan Turner’s voice sound like lil Yatchy to y’all? 🤔
Get Evan off the mics for good
Good players have to go to trash teams. That's just how it is. In order for my man to become James Harden pt 2 he gotta go somewhere else.
Never heard Evan Turner’s voice before, I wasn’t expecting it
Evan Turner sounds like lil yachtys older brother lol
Dude sound like Earnie from Sesame Street 😂
Yo anyone think Evan turner sound like lil yachty
Why does Evan Turner sound like Lil Yatchy😂
Jordan Poole wanted to be a star not win games
My issue is jordan should of never thought he had any freedom that vets have. Regardless of what he was doing he came to a established championship franchise. 3:50
So you help a team win the finals and they get rid of you. There’s no excuse for this the organization should handle there players this is weak they can’t get grown men on the same page
Jordan would've been a better fit if he didn't do so many idiotic and stupid things. He was too immature and erratic. He lost the ball often... took very stupid shots. He though he was steph ad he doesn't compare.
Lil Yachty looks like Evan Turner 😂😂🧐
Now who y’all think those teammates were? 😂
Is that evan turner or lil yaghty lmaoooo wtf
😂 @ Evan Turner's voice
Best player in Philly history?? Whoa.. where did that come from?? 🍃
Evan Turner laugh always sends me
Poole got assaulted and EVERYBODY was cool with it and y'all are surprised that Jordan was in full "F y'all" mode for the rest of the season?
This is what happens when you have a dynasty situation. 2015 first ring 2022 latest ring. That was literally last year they won so things gotta make sense and unfortunately draymonds behavior makes sense for this team and pooles didnt.
Evan might have the most god awful voice god has ever given a man 😂
Evan Turner sounds like the bad guy in the movie 300.  Zercese
Wth Evan turner doing there?
I think Iggy was talking about Melo
Evan Turner may have one of the worst voices ever
The warriors are in denial. Blame all their problems on Pole to hide from the fact they are undersized and their star players are getting old.
jesus christ evan turner don’t talk got damn
this nigga turner voice is irritating
😂😂😂😂 I'll never get tired of hearing Turners voice sounding like meatball from AquaTeamHungerForce 😂😂😂😂
Guess I’ll go ahead and subscribe. every vid this man drop have interesting convos
Turner sounds like a robot.
Wow he was falling down not to play defense. Iggy probably should kept that one to himself.
IMO one of the worst signings in the history of the NBA.   Why would you pay a small guard who doesnt fit in the starting line up?  Dude doesnt play any def and it was clear from day one he doesnt fit next to curry!
Jordan Poole is a great 6th man. If he’s your 2nd or third option you’re not probably not getting out of the 1st round.
Jordan Poole did not win game 5 , it was Andrew Wiggins who won that. Jordan had 14 pts, Andrew had 26 points, 13 rebounds.
Poole can’t defend though
Evan turner sounds exactly like lil yahty 😭😭😭
Evan Turner sound like stitch.
Is it just me or does Evan Turner sound like “Kermit the frog”
Poole figured it worked with KD why I can’t be that 3rd killer but KD different 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
This nigga sound like meat ball from ATHF lolol
Iguodala is a rat.
Why Evan Turner sound like Yachty 😂
What 😮 I'm getting from this teammate was pretty much jealous of Jordan Poole performance , the warriors should be ashamed of themselves,😂 jealousy is a hell of a drug period 🏀🌟, that young man is a hooper,🏀they had Poole   covering for Steph Curry and he did a damn good job 👍 need i say more , and the Washington wizards are lucky to have got Jordan Poole big ups to them !!!!
That story making me think Jimmy Butler, but second thought he might be digging deep and going back to AI days.
Screw this dude. Gave up on the Nuggets.
Evan Turner sounds like lil yachty 😂🤣😂🤣
Draymond to Stephen: i'm a fool to do your dirty work oh yeah!
Klay was second leader in scoring 🙄
if JP really thinking like that as a young player, GSW made a right trade there, this guy has a very limited future.
The nigga in the glasses... I'd personally write lyrics for him just to hear him on a beat He'd body the delivery🔥🔥
Why is Evan turners voice like that 😭
Only reason Poole was the 2nd leading scorer is Klay was out 2+ yrs injured. JJ consistently ignores context and never pushes back on his guests because he's an espn shill. Poole was not only terrible on defense last season he was awful on offense. That playoff game vs the Lakers where he launches a 3 with 10 seconds left while Klay and Steph are on the court? Garbage decision making and shot selection. But just ignore it like it never happened.
Evan turners voice 🤬🤮
Evan Turners voice scared tf out of me
I hope every young player understands this really well. If you believe and bet on yourself. That why Jordan Poole got paid. It ok. They won't win without him.
“cp’s gon help ‘them’ more than they know”   soooo he’s officially retiring then right? or am i out the loop and that’s been confirmed already lol
This my first time hearing Evan Turner talk, he sound like he got 5 frogs in his throat 😂
Dre really a OG lol
He was second in scoring BUT. His volume went way up, and efficiency went way down. So, averaging 20.4ppg is subjective. He shot worse from 3 than Draymond.
Evan Turner sounds like lil yatchy
Evan turner talk like he got a frog or Spit in his throat the whole time 🤣🤣🤣
Click bait 🤮🤮🤮
No way Evan Turner sounds like lil Yachty
Iggy said 5-6 years ago he dealed with that locker room drama. Bet it was dray and cupcake durant
Evan Turner should consider a career in cartoon voice acting. He sounds like meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
This dude sounds like kawhi
Washington putting together a team of misfits similar to what the warriors did before the Curry era.
Bro sound like lil yachty
AI is trying so hard not to say Miami.
I think JJ Redick would’ve been a good pickup for Skip Bayless and Undisputed. He has too many football players commenting on basketball. Shannon was great but Sherman, Johnson, and Irving’s takes on NBA simply are not that interesting and not even based on analytics.
Did he say eagles at the end and not 76ers...?
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty
Why does Evan and lil yachty have the exact same voice 😂😂😂😂
Jordan Poole is overrated  This Steph curry, draymond and klay team. Thank god Poole got traded. His ego got to big . He gonna do nuthing in Washington
Dammit, now with CP3 the Warriors are probably gonna get a 5th ring. Nothing makes me feel sicker, but that's what I fear is coming... any thoughts??
“Man f them kids bro” all I hear after turner speaks 😂
Evan’s voice sounds like there’s a little man in that back of his throat talking to us.
Jordan Poole didn’t understand that he was scoring because of the system in Golden State… All the attention that Steph and Klay were getting…. Plus he had a lot of turn overs and was a defensive liability…. His time was coming but he wanted it too soon… Why you think they gave him the contract? They believed in him but he changed after the contract and it showed… That’s how him and Dray got into it cuz Dray was still at the end of his contract and Poole was over flexing…. He even spent a half a mill on some female rapper on one date which shows his immaturity…. He was one of ours and we hated losing him but he had to go and we will be fine…. Wish him nothing but the best!!!
Which hoodies is JJ wearing?
Being a JJ fan all my life till he opens his mouth about the kings
Poole looks like a homeless man in Washington. The baddies dont hit the same out east 😂
Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty
Damn, that's a terrible looking studio. Each guy has a different background and all of them are pretty whack
I'm listening to Kermit the frog here
the fact that players know poole was intentionally trying to avoid giving effort just makes me even madder. so much potential and he's just a damn clown on defense. some of these young entitled kids are their own worst enemies. steph klay and dray all sacrificed something for the team - and they won because of their defense and their intense commitment to getting better and coming together as a cohesive team. there's no room for selfishness or egos on this team. steph can come off the bench for poole in 2022 - but poole can't accept losing minutes when he is obviously playing like hot trash.
This man going to average 30 this year he has green light him and Kuzma going to tear things up
As usual. JJ "there's a lot to unpack" Redick
Reggie White probably the greatest Eagles player ever, Donovan Mcnabb isn’t even the best Eagles QB ever.
E be saying a bunch of nothing a lotta times
JJs sub count doesn’t make sense lmao. How does he get half a million views in 6 hours
Evan turners voice was unexpected
I feel we shouldn’t have traded Jp if anything we shoulda got rid of draymond
Evan Turner be talking like he got autotune in his voice😂
If Jordan Poole Brings. 🏆 to Washington faster than Beal and Wall then He Deserves a Statue outside 🤣💯🔥🏀
Lil yachty voice 😊
Jordan Poole is the Closest thing to Steph Curry we've ever seen...I guarantee he will turn DC all the way around 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🏀
bruh 5-6 years ago you mean on the same team in their dynasty phase LOL.
JP3 did understand his role is the issue... he was never the now starter, but he was getting starter player minutes on the floor.  He should have understood that he was the young players Steph Curry and should have focused on leading the bench and when time goes he would be the starter
Poole was never good there's two ends of the floor cp3 plays both ways
The problem with Jordan poole last postseason was he didn't try to incorporate the team. He was trying to pad his stats. He was playing selfish basketball. Look at anytime he took possession of the ball, in times he should have pasted the ball he would see the person open, try to become a highlight with a crossover and slip like water was on the court. He lost possession too many times of the ball because of carelessness and selfishness. They should have put kuminga on the court more, instead of him.
Dude with the glasses sound like Lil Yachty.
Andre is such a good basketball conversationalist.
Jordan Poole at his age was better than klay and Steph at that age. He just needed vets and a coaching staff to help him out.   He carried them in a few games the year they won.
Your vids/ pods are great man. Keep them comming!
Wish he couldve gone to the Lakers. He grinded while everyone else was down and out and become a bonafide superstar, then Klay comes back (below his best) and Poole gets dropped…. Sames gonna happen to Kumi and Mood I fear with CP zero here now.
That dude sound like lil yachty
Close your eyes and tell me even turner ain’t still lil yachty voice 🤣
Why Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty
Bro gotta get them tonsils out...smh
Why dude sound like Lol Yachty lol
I mean I understand his frustration but he doesn’t look happier with the wizards. To win you must sacrifice. If his mouth didn’t get him in trouble he really could of took over that franchise in 2-3 years easy. Tragic loss
Same people saying trade klay and draymond to keep Poole is the same people that would’ve been clowning them if they did that and gave up their defensive leader despite what they had going on behind the scenes doesn’t change the fact he underperformed poorly in the post season, and yes you can say klay did as well but it’s understandable because klay will never be the same he suffered a career ending injury, the only thing hurt about Poole was his EGO.
I started singing oooohhhh when I saw this pop up in my time line lmao
Jordan should've just waited ✋️ your turn .  Hope he made the right career choice.
Poor Jordan got SCREWED, 1st by that Woman Draymond Green Punching him and then getting kicked to the Curb, which is WACK!!!! It SHOULD HAVE been the Other Way Around!!! Green is OLD and will never be what he once was!!!!
I wish Poole good luck in Washington. Maybe the Wizards will make the 11th Seed this year 😇
Poole was a big problem, I’m so glad he’s gone. Incredibly poor decisions on offense, zero attempt to play defense, petulant child, playing 100% on emotion. He won a game in the finals, but he lost games too.  So glad Iguodala is acknowledging the problem. Everybody else is playing high road.
The warriors weakness is one person ,steve kerr ..... steve kerr is one of the worst coaches in the game , how can a normal coach neglect the importance of having atleast 2 big centers who can dominate the defense and offence .... if someone is a good coach he should see the Draymond green is not a good basketball player , how did this guy get into the NBA?? This guy can't even score if his life depended on it ..... the opposing team actually dont gaurd him ,they let him shoot .... in this day and age been a loud mouth cheerleader is not enough , just been a defensive player is not enough,you have to be an offensive threat ..... Draymond green is the second weakness after steve kerr .....  with the type of shooters the warriors have , they could have created a indestructible team , but no huge centers and pathetic green cemented their limitation.... pathetic
Jordan Poole was the reason they lost the playoffs
I had this on without looking and couldn't figure out why Lil Yachty was on here 😂
Poole took the punch and played the long game. Helped them get to the playoffs and laid an egg when he knew they would need him most. Then he got traded, which is what he wanted after the Warriors insulted and humiliated him. Good on him!
They are telling Jordan he was wrong in a diplomatic way .
Poole sucked
I dont see it , he not that good to me , he was a weat coast trey young alot of bad shot iq , no defense, poor attitude, and over confident, he doesnt pass at all, team figured him out and he did nothing to improve his game
Evan turner sound like lil yachty
why does evan turner sound like jar jar binks?
Evan Turner sound like Lil Yatchy
Never a dull moment hearing Iggy talk about the game of basketball
I wasn’t looking at the screen and thought that was Yahty talking
Long story short NBA players are hoes!!!
Evan Turner has a weird voice…I’m hearing an out of breath Vin Diesel
Golden State gonna have to get rid of Kerr once Curry Klay and Draymond is gone, Kerr can coach veterans that know and understand the game on the same level he see its, coaching team USA showed how hard he has it to work with the younger generation, Wiseman traded, Poole traded, kunmiga in trade talks, what young player has actually been developed under Kerr.. he cant develope players and name one player the Warriors drafted that developed under Kerr?
the Lou William bit was good .  LoL
EGO of Draymond Green who is CEO on Court! He didn't like Pool because he wasn't humble enough!
He got the bag. That changed him.
I’m happy for Jordan Poole, he has a fresh start. Warriors AREN’T winning a damn thing this year and foolishly kept Draymond, I can’t wait to see the excuses for the 2024 season when they get cooked..  Run been over, and teams are better in the West than they are
How are you giving game 5 to jordan -poole?  That's the Wiggins game.
Jordan Poole was Scapegoated point blank period basically replaced CP3 for Jordan Poole and CP3 might not even finish the season in SF
Poole going to the wizards is going to mature his game since he can play freely, we seen what he can do when the warriors was on there championship run. He gonna be great
Evan Turner and Lil Yachty are voice twins
FMVP
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty
I have been waiting for someone credible to put words to the JP situation with the team this way for months!! Thank you as always Andre for finally being the person to speak facts. So much of the media around this is so mind boggled on the relationship or loves to only focus on the punch and some awful feud. NAH. JP a sniper but he's no second fiddle. The man was hitting half court bank shots in the finals, he needs a loose leash. But when you got 3 stars that need the same leeway, that multiplies the magnitude of JP coming down the floor and hitting a double hesi and the ball flying straight into the stands. I think there should be no love lost as he is that dude, and in 3-5 years this could've been his team, but no hate on him not wanting to wait on that.
Poole is the epitome of someone who just wants to put up numbers. Like Love in Minnesota or Beal in Washington.. except he would be content with the L's as long as he has the numbers.
Turners voice sounds like a Sesame Street professor
I wasn’t looking and thought turner was lil yachty
Thought I heard lil Yachty say sumn 😂
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yatchy 😮
Bruh JPs early promotional with Wizards, you can see the hurt in his eyes 😂😂😂
Stop wit the Philly shots.. funny thing is combined all 3 of yall that would’ve been what we wanted.. unfortunate yall 3 different people
The video title is key fr. If yk yk
They could’ve made it work . Crazy how they just gave him away for peanuts
Point blank period they did JP dirty smmfh
What’s wrong with Evan’s voice? Sounds like Chef from the muppets
Was that Britney Griner ???? 😂
IGGY IS AWESOME BUT EVAN TURNER HAS THE WORST FOCKING VOICE IN NBA HISTORY AND THAT GOTDAM LAUGH IS EVEN WORSE IT IS LITERALLY HORRENDOUS ITS LIKE SOMEONE PUT AN EVIL SPELL ON HIS THROAT AND HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING INTERESTING ENOUGH TO WARRANT BEING HAUNTED BY THAT HORROR PLZ STOP PUTTING HIM ON MICROPHONES TIL HE GETS A VOCAL CHORD TRANSPLANT OMFG
Can someone tell me where iguodala got that shirt?
I'm a HUGE klay Thompson fan...but with the year he had Jordan Poole definitely should have been 2nd scoring option
Frog voice really got on pearls🤣
Tell me why Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty
Evan Turner sound like lil yatchy
End of the day he forgot that it wasn’t his team, he wanted it to happen faster than allowed. I had high hopes that he would be able to take over after Steph slowed down but Steph still playing like he’s the MVP so I think the best move was to trade cuz Poole is too good to just use him on the second squad.
Evan Turner sound like Lil Yachty
These three are a winning combo.   Have them on again!
Poole was affected by getting hit with all the carrying calls earlier in the year.
Evan Turner voice sounds like someone is choking him. 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Why Evan sound like Yatchy?
JJ clear your throat bro.
did this guy retire?
Evan turner sound like lil Yahty wit a voice changer
5:47 It reminds me of this Bart Simpson quote: "I can't promise I'll try, but I'll try to try." 🤣🤣
If I didn’t see fingertips on the edge of the image, I would have thought the 3 of you were in 3 completely different locations, then I see the full shot and I know…
Evan turner sounds like lil yachty
Not only can younger people better handle the toxicity of something like Tren, but also but they can bounce back easier if they decide they want to go off completely and not resign themselves to being addicted to synthetic androgens for the rest of their life
The obvious faking it by Poole turned people off. He spent most of his time pouting and throwing away possession. Now in Washington, he’ll get all the shots and attention he wants and miss the playoffs.
Every part of Jordan Poole analysis should start with him getting clocked  How can you talk about him taking responsibility in a team that backed a guy who sucker punched him? What is this bullshit I’m hearing
Also Poole did NOTHING to add to his bag in the off season after the championship win he rested on his laurels and teams made a HUGE scouting report on him come playoff time and he was exposed badly on offense and defense when you a up and coming player like he was and make great season for yourself and got clout etc etc ALWAYS come back better the next season than last
If you close your eyes and listen to Evan Turner, you can hear Lil Yachty talkin hoops
Poole is young and immature but very talented! He's very competitive and best curry in ft% but wasn't rewarded. I'm in interested to see what he's able to do with his own team now. Great trade for both teams in theory. They need a true point since Iggy and Livingston are gone... and somehow they couldn't replace them. Not loving the direction of the team resigning the core for 4 more years. They got beat down in the post season and on all their road games... it was time for a shake up.
Dam the second Turner started talking I turned off the podcast
dude sounds like Lil Yachty
You guys obviously love your Golden State heroes Draymond Green (Jealous) Klay Thompson and of course Curry Golden State has no tough guys (never have) who could have stopped Green from bullying Poole. The Kid was 21 yrs old how much  maturity did they want him to have? Instead of helping him they all dumped on him Especially that weak coach (Kerr) Poole had no one behind him including  Andre U! Disgusting!
Iggy cut from a different cloth, he played with the real A.I....🤔
Evan Turner is the NBA Humpty hump 😂
Dawg sound like lil boat
I don’t think Jordan Poole is gonna live up to the hype I feel if your that good the coach would give you free reign within the system now he has his own team it’s gonna be totally different. But, I think he needed to go off by himself cause people have to see if he can really perform.
This is so good 🍿 love this conversation
Evan turner voice is not made for podcasting but I get it
Poole got points when he did what they wanted , when he didn't, it was ugly
Turner zesty af
he did not show anything.
Why he sound gay 😂 what’s his name in the long sleeve
Evan turner hasn’t swallowed since 2012
Evan turner and Lil Yachty sound so much a like, its crazy
Evan looks like an alien and sounds like one too
He sounds corny cussin😂
Turners voice is so annoying (I'm sorry)
Turner sounds like he has pickles under his tongue
Jordan poole is a good athlete but hes still young a turn over machine and take wild shots in crucial moments!  I rather have a veteran Chris Paul all day that knows how to score, pass, play defense, and knows how to control the ball!
Not all points are created equal when it comes to Jordan Poole. His lack of efficiency and ability to make others better is the main reason his scoring is not valued as much for a team with Championship aspirations. As much as he won the GSW a game in the finals he was also unplayable for multiple rounds of the playoffs because of his lack of defense and efficiency. 🤷🏾‍♂️ go figure..
evan turner messed up the whole flow of this part of the interview
Cp3 Will play 20 games 😂
I’m over this GS core. It’s played out
#Iguodala and #ShaunLivingston leaving the team was the end for Golden State Warriors.
What happened to tommy?
Evan Turner sound like he’s being choked 😂
evan turner sounds like lil yachty, no? 😂
My first time hearing Evan Turner talk and cuz sound like he talking thru a box fan.
I really don’t like Evan turner any more after that Giannis statement
Love Evan Turner, but I swear Lil Yachty was talking..
Andre swears he's smart
To Poland
He was a huge part of why they won a chip… they couldn’t have done it without Poole
Jordan and Kuz are gonna score a shitload this upcoming season, but I think they're both gonna be trying hard to not try on D.
since when jordan is a second leading scorer ? klay is dead or something ?
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty
Why does Evan sound like that😂
JJ, when did you guys get lil yacthy on the pod? 😂
Have a JJ Redick in me is wild... pause!
Great video but I have to know. Why the hell is Evan Turner out here sounding like Lil Yachty? 😂
JJ will go down as one of the best analyzer/ broadcasters ever
Iguodala is ready for broadcasting. About to make the most money of his life like Chuck
1 mil before the year over?
It's a blessing and a curse to play for the warriros at times.
Evan Turner with the greatest Lil Yachty impression of all time.
We all saw Poole last season .. should’ve stayed humble
JJ has mastered the art of stfu and allowing guests to finish their thoughts
Brah Iguodala seem like a cool dude 😂
This the political stuff, if you making moves to help win a team why can’t you do that it’s a team sport not individual that’s why the pros be going through it mentally because you can’t do what you did to make it to the professional level
When lil yatchy get a small fro and glasses ?
Donovan?
This dude sounds like Lil Yachty
JJ got it spot on. GSW need another Shaun Livingston archetypal PG type player off the bench. The only issue is Klay isn't what he used to be so Wiggins or someone else has to step up scoring wise.
Imagine an NBA locker room where all the dudes were emotionally mature.  Is that possible?
There are points on both sides.  Poole might be right trying to want a bigger role...hell, he's got a small chance of winning the scoring title next year volume shooting empty points on the Wiz, but Iguodala is the living proof for why you're going to end up better off fitting in to a proven winner.    Iguodala won an MVP as the 4th option lol...he's going to make the Hall of Fame on the back of that MVP and those rings.  Tony Parker did the same thing, essentially playing to fit in with 2-3 different #1 option players over his time in SA, won a Finals MVP and still made the Hall of Fame.  No chance in the world Jordan Poole ends up in the hall of fame 15 years from now.
Bro Evan Turner sounds like Meatwad
It all boils down to this: NBA is now filled with a bunch of entitled brats who make a crap ton of money.
If you got punched by your teammate and the refs targeted you for violations at the start of the season really throws your confidence.  He needs to have his own team and being traded is a blessing for him.
I hope he’s an all star in the future!
I was watching this minimized and thought Lil Yachty was doing this interview.
Am I the only one that thinks Evan Turner has a weird voice?
Evan talking about the Blazers lol
It was time for Poole to leave, when he stopped trying to win in the Lakers series, Poole quite
Draymond made a big deal about talking some day about what really was said when he decked JP. So what's it gonna be. JP shipped to Washington, Dray got a new contract. What is he waiting for. Because I have a feeling, JP said something that is said on an NBA court or the locker room a hundred times a day and nobody is getting clocked.
@5:55 they all know exactly what he saying
So he wanted to be Top Boy and he wasn't. Got it
Lou Will 😂
turner voice sound like somebody holding his nose
Remember when poole faked fumbled the ball out of bounds in the playoffs
Meet ET in PBC. Really dope guy. 🔥🏀⛹🏾‍♂️ #BallisLife
Yo is this really Evan Turner’s voice??? Like his nose don’t work.
lmaoooo the lou williams comment 😂😂😂😂
yooooooooooooooo
easy to talk about another man once he’s no longer associated with your team and you don’t have to see him every day
and no one dare talk negative about curry becoz he is cash of the league. not even Bron dare😅
Bro sounds like yachty
Dude sound like lil yacht
He sounds like yachty with a stuffy nose
Bro calling McNabb the best player in eagles history is wild
Evan “lil boat” turner 😂😅
Idk why I thought Evan Turner was yachty when he started speaking😭
only thing Poole do wrong was trying getting the ball from curry hand😂
Once Poole got that big contract. The hunger was gone
Had no idea Evan Turner sounded like that
Evan Turner voice strange than a mf
What so many people ignore is the fact that he was awful offensively and defensively last season. Sure the numbers looked good but no matter what lineup he was in he was a hindrance in some way and the numbers reflect that. The attitude problems as well as the fact that he is one of the worst decision makers and primary ball handlers in the league makes it all even worse.
5-6 years ago is good cap iggy
Poole was clearly not trying. I'm glad he got traded.  Sure he helped us win a chip but like last season he was trash to put it nicely.
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty
Bro trippin for disrespecting all the greats to play here with that last statement
If you close your eyes and listen, youll hear Lil Yachty talking about basketball in this video.
Jordan has a low IQ and is a clown off the court. They overpaid him
dude in the glasses sounds like lil yachty lol
ET Sound like lil yachty
is it just me or Evan Turner sounds like JarJar Binks?
Evan Turner sounds exactly like Lil Yachty and that’s nuts
Bruh i’m listening at work and thought JJ reddick got Lil Yachty on with Iguodala
nice conversation between former Philly  players..hahahahaha
Evan Turner really sounds like Lil Yatchy!
Why he sound like Kermit the frog 😂
JJ you are the man.   Love your content and views on the game - You keep it real and do not bow down to goofballs not to name names but Steven A _ i sincerely hope to see a LOT more from you.
Evan Turner sounds like Kermit the Frog stuffed into a tube sock.
*i really need to hear Evan turner sing a lil yachty song*
Say what you want, but Sweet Lou Williams gave you buckets all day, dude was consistent. He didn't win 6 man of the year twice for nothing!! 💯
Andre one of the realest in the league.
JP is so overrated! He landed on a great team and he thinks he's Brad Pitt in the looks department.  JP on a bottom tier team would be so forgettable
Why turner sound like yachty
Iggy was talking about KD
4:20 as soon as he started talkin bout culture, I immediately knew he was talking about the heat lmfaooooo
Lou Williams took a healthy warriors with KD to 6 by himself !! He was giving them hell !!
Steph dont have 4 without jp
I wasn’t looking at my screen and the next thing I know I hear meatwad from aqua teen speaking to me 😂
Wow I didnt realize JP was second in scoring on the Warriors…I wonder if he’ll ever really talk about the warriors trading him and the Draymond drama in an interview or on one of these podcasts
So that’s why Draymond hit him 😂
😂😂 can’t get over Turner really sounds like Stitch 😂😂 great podcast tho!
Lil boat!!
I can't wait to see Poole in DC. I don't think he's going to be a superstar, but he will light it up. His defense will always be sus. But it was obvious he mentally checked out of Golden State after the Draymond punch.
Why this nigga Evan Turner talk like a Muppet?
Hard listen
Great insight
Lmao ET sounds like Elmo literally 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude voice in the glasses is crazy
Andre was 100% correct on that effort comment. Only guys that played sports at the high levels would understand. When you see guys faking it to get out of situations. Jordan was doing that all last year on defense 😂
Good player just horrible for his contract
Meh. Dude just taking punches, then dude gone.
Poole trade shows me warriors will never win another title
ET sounds like Lil Yachty 😭
Evan talks like lil yachty
Evan Turner has a very awkward  voice. Makes me real uncomfortable listening to him.
Lil yachty on this show now huh?
Evan Turner sounds like Princess Bubblegum
Evan Turner sounds like Princess Bubblegum
tbh im not any more clear and feel no more informed about the Pool situation than I was 7-8min ago... but DAMMIT WAS I ENTERTAINED!
ET sound like lil yachty 😂
bruh evan turner voice be fuckin my head up
Poole is a high school boy who only can play well when he sees baddie
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Iggy confirms what we suspected. JP got too ambitious too soon but didnt want to put in the work and it showed...he was lazy on the floor and was often slacking during practices as well...GSW made a big mistake with him...
Why that mf sound like meatwad from ATHF breh
Jordan Poole will figure out real quick why you don't build around him this year. He is turnover prone, bad shots and can't guard anyone!
Why he sound like lil yachty 😂
I WANT IGUODALA
Trying not to try makes perfect sense..get punched by a teammate and have it go viral and no accountability from the team? Yeah try to not try makes sense in that context...
4:23 😭
https://youtu.be/C1bnREyyHoU?si=n25ngfDAjYI-4feK
Turner sounds like lil yachty
The real problem player was another J - 🃏🔥
Warriors the most toxic work environment in the league 💯
What I couldnt stand the most about watching Poole play besides the turnovers was his reaction to losing especially when he was a big factor,  he didn't care , you see him on the bench smiling and joking while the majority of the team looked pissed!
Evan Turner can cook
just watching Poole this last season reminded me of out of control W. One move got em, but then to much. Poole did more splits than a ballerina.
Evan Turner sounds so much like Lil Yachty
Evans voice takes me out of it everytime lmao
This ain't Iggy's story to tell
I just find it so wild how similar Evan sounds like lil Yachty
I understand the Draymond punch affected him but he was more polished in the championship year than last year. He went from torching the Nuggets to slipping on invisible banana peels every possession
Evan turner sound more like lil yatchy  than lil yatchy 😳
Andre was my favorite player my whole life
Evan turner sound like a gay Darth vader.
Beyond him inexplicably just slipping/losing the ball constantly, what pissed me off the most was how after losing the ball, he would just throw his hands up/pout and not run back on defense. Meanwhile, his teammates would be hustling back and hes just standing there. That, beyond anything else, was my biggest issue with him.
https://youtu.be/C1bnREyyHoU?si=n25ngfDAjYI-4feK
Turners voice is annoying
I thought lil Yachty was on the podcast lol
never saw a guy like evan turner. dude is talking like he did anything in the nba  i dont know where his overconfidence here.  plus dude sound like a frog
why does evan turner sound like lil yachty
I can’t get over Evan sounding exactly like LIL YACHTY 😂
He did not win then game 5 tf. He was front running a stampede
Even Turner sounds like Lil Yachy 🤣
Evan turner sounds like he’s trynna gargle strawberries
Real conversation gotta love it
Thought I accidentally clicked on a Lil Yachty podcast😂😂😂
Why Evan Turner Sound Like Lil Yatchy
JP might be second in scoring with warriors but his efficiency was atrocious.
The more comments I read the more realize...... Yall dont watch basketball, you just skim through it.  Have we forgotten this is team ball and not just 5 iso players on the court?  As a GS fan, hate to see JP go but reality is he doesnt fit the role on the team. Consider: does he stay if Meyers stays? Dont know but clearly the luxury tax helped make that decision.  This is a business, stop being so sensitive. Players get traded all the time.
What the hell is wrong with his voice.
ET damn near sound like Doc Rivers 😂
Evan sound like lil yachty
Evan Turner still wrong for how he tried to do SpongeBob with them pickles…
Is it just me or does Evan Turner sound weird as hell when he talks
Andre & Evan got a show coming or something
Evan Turner got a weird voice 😂😂
evan turner sounds like lil yachty
Ole boy sound like the muppet babies
Let's be honest, this was 100% on Steve Kerr. Poole is a sparkplug who should never get big/consistent minutes (anywhere) Kerr LOVED Poole and ruined the Warriors last year
Jordan Poole averaged 13.2 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 6 games in the 2022 NBA Finals.
gotta get his tonsils out
Poole is the second best player on that team. Klay just felt too entitled when in reality he fell off to just another buddy heild. He doesn’t dribble or creat shots for anyone. Dray also punched pooole and literally nobody stuck up for him. If i was Poole i wouldn’t care bout this team either. Watch he put up 25+ a game now tho
Entitlement. Only an arrogant fool can think he should be treated equal to Steph Dray and Klay after one good season  Young and dumb. Dude was such a headache that he got punched by his teammates. Dray got handled for doing it and they STILL chose him over you, even though Dray is not the same guy he used to be and you are still yet to even play your best basketball  Culture > self
Piggy was one of my favorite players when he was in the court. Always showed up. Could easily change what’s taking place on court. Much respect.
I believe golden state will regret letting go of Poole & wiseman
Andre McNabb?
Why Evan turner sound like he can voice miss piggy and Kermit’s son if they had one?!?!  😂😂😂😂😂
Evan Turner sounds like lil Yatchy but congested
I love Jordan Poole game and he is a starter in this league. But let's settle down a bit. He will not avg 30 ppg next season. GSW system was a part of his success. He studied and learned how to move off ball like Klay and Curry does in that system. He won't get those same easy looks in WAS.
Evan Turner voice is so irritating🤣
What happened to Tommy? 😅
Q
They gonna miss pool cp3 old injured warriors got worse
Jordan is an inefficient shot chucker. All style no substance to his game
Bro need to be a Disney voice actor he in the wrong profession podcasting
Jordan Poole be crossing himself up more than defenders
I never knew bro sounded like yachty
Love hearing Iggy speak. What a legend
Getting off from Poole was the best decision they could make. Dude started out trash, worked hard and had a breakout season but was humble throughout, and then instantly thought he was Hollywood and was taking over the team from Steph. His D was abysmal and then his offense reverted back his lottery pick position, yet still kept acting like he had Steph clout. I will blame Kerr some though, he let Klay do whatever he’ll he wants even when he’s making really dumb decisions so of course Poole thinks he should be able to get away with the same things.
JJ keep going, ☺🤣
Bro the fact Draymond and some GS fan have successfully turned the situation around and made it seem like Poole is the reason for all of GSs struggles and he’s the one to blame is crazy. At this point you would think he threw the punch lmaooo. The main reason they lost was because Poole regressed after Draymond knocking him out, Klay was back to full health and was buns, Steph’s and Wiggins were out for a while, Draymond couldn’t hit a shot, and the biggest thing, they were small lmao. No size and small ball only took them so far
iggy chill af
So glad they got rid of JP...now they see how bad he sucks .....own a team  packed with championship talent
Evan seriously sounds like meatwad
Jordan Poole won what finals game??? 😂😂😂 cap
You guys are going to completely ignore what he did in that 2022 playoff run and what he did overall that season. He almost became the most improved player. One bad playoff run and that defines his entire career. The dude averaged 20+ a game last season. "he was a defensive liability," shut up that was never his specialty. The reason why he wasn't playing so well was that he moved back to the bench, playin in the starting lineup for most of the season and then transitioning back to the 6th man role trying to adjust to a role he was never comfortable with, especially when Steph was in-and-out for most of the regular season.
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Jesus didn’t come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 💯
nobody seems to wanna talk about how JP intentionally sunk the team in the playoffs this year
Is it just me or does Evan sound exactly like Lil Yachty lol
Did not know E.T. sounded like that
Poole is a good player taking good shots. But when he learns the difference between good shots and great shots, he’ll unlock into something else
et talking about portland!
Paul can not help. A no ring star like Wiggens helped. Paul proved he's a no ring star that can't help any team win a chip
Dude sound like yachty 💀💀
the dude in the striped sweater sound like a muppet & and he had the audacity to be longwinded
The reason why they lost in playoffs bc they played dray and klay too long they aren’t condition like a Steph , plus Poole never got the chance of consistent play like he did throughout the regular season
The reason why they lost in playoffs bc they played dray and klay too long they aren’t condition like a Steph , plus Poole never got the chance of consistent play like he did throughout the regular season
JJ “There’s A Lot To Unpack” Reddick
This is kinda disrespectful for everyone in this discussion to keep saying Poole was 2nd in scoring, when he was actually 3rd. For a player to come back after 2 years, no offseason training, only to then lead the league in 3 pointers, averaging 22ppg is crazy to me.
He should a been happy as a 6th man Iggy did it when he came ta Oakland
We will see what  Poole can do at Wash
Evan Turner talking about the Portland teams. No defense, no assists, but made it to WCF
Philly organization did. him dirty. Iggy is the man!
The warriors are old and small and wasted their young talent
Evan Turner sounds like a muppet.
Evan turner sound like lil yachty.
Draymond Green basically destroyed the confidence of all the talented young players Golden State drafted in order to secure one last bag. And the warriors allowed it. So they'll get what they deserve from that decision.
Draymond need to be traded.... dude trash. And idk what he does he's overrated. And I would've had him arrested if I was poole
new fan of show. keep it going
Ah, Poole... Good riddance.
Iguodala always my favorite.
Boy is lil yachty doing a voice over for even turner kuz wtf JJ 😂😂
B4 i see it i bet dat Poole was poolin n crackin on Draystomp about MSU vs Michigan n said something like u ain't even yo lil niece fave player n i could smash whatever she gets of age or u old cuz, im da new nia n Day Day had enough. Now im from Oakland so i lightweight kinda know but don't but i wanna hear Iggy. He got a nice book by tha way i read a couple yrs ago kool kat i saw him Downtown Oak n he kept it P.I.  I still liked Poole until he pulled dat sh*t n da playoffs but wish him da best
Don't forget thay jp played amazinggg before Draymond knocked him out
Bro why he got lil Yachty doin his voiceover 😂😂😂😂
The difference is clay, steph and dray if told 'pull back' listen.  pool didnt.  And it cost them.  Dude can play.  Got a bag.  Got a little lazy and wild.  Got the check.
The thing about Iggy is that he is saying stuff that I haven’t heard other players say. Gold!
Dude get hit and gets paid so it went well for Jordan Poole.
He was 3rd on the team in scoring.  Klay averaged 22 ppg
Jordan Poole is equal to Jordan Clarkson. They elite offensively with basketball and that’s it. All they bring is scoring
Jaylen Rose said the day of the punch that Poole and Green would never be the same again. MAYBE if the Warriors actually punished Green, that would have helped Poole.
Choose Draymond Green over Poole...and traded away Wiseman....but signed CP3? They will not be winning any more titles
Evan Turner sounds exactly like Lil Yachty
Jordan Poole looks like the type who listens to the song “Dupe x Skyloker - cash” , on the low 😊
When I heard Evan Turner's voice without looking at the video, I was like, "Why is Lil' Yachty on the show?!"
Jordan Poole don’t play no defense at all that was the problem
Evan Turner's vocals are erry. He has a demonic voice box.
Your tryin Not to try That's the perfect way to sum up Poole last year.
Frog in your throat ET?
evan turner sounds like an AI lil yaghty
C’mon !! Kerr is a push over !!  No proper discipline was given to Draymond Green after that cheap shot to Poole.. Yea Poole may hav a mouth on him and costed him along the way… Kerr may have the accolades and rings like his predecessor in Pop or Phil Jackson, but not the discipline part js
Im surprised that he felt that way, I fsfs thought he wouldn’t care if he got less touches. I feel if the punch never happened he would’ve loved to sacrifice for the team
Evan Turner sounds like a Sesame Street character mixed with Lil Yachty
JJ hit the nail on the head end of story
Help them this year. Ah sound like he just broke some news unintentionally lol
Lil Yachty was a great addiction with Iggy
Iguodala: "I'm going to level with you, I first saw him I thought one word: scrub. But then, Kylie Jenner was in the building and he went off for 50 points, full on Mamba mode"
“BINGO” 😂
Bro JP was a cocky boi lol cmon now. Of course, that's how he gets his confidence I get it, but I could tell he was kind of arrogant in my opinion
Evan turner sounds like meatwad and lil yachty combined that’s pretty dope
Bro, if am Kerr...im starting Paul at the PG, and have 2 SG with Klay and Steph just running around looking cor ahots...that shi is going to be scarey
My guess for the future HOFer that Iggy mentioned in his "buddy ball" story is Jermaine O'Neal
The thing with Poole and The Warriors is they wanted and needed him to be all things to the team. One minute he's the 6th man, the next they needed him to start in place of Steph and be the leading scorer! The next minute he's back on the bench and required to lead the 2nd unit which contained 2 two way players and two 2nd year players the coach didn't trust. No role consistency at all and a terrible roster and he was 23 years old with nowhere near the amount of experience the vets had. Washington will actually be good for him. The new player development coaches the Wizards have hired have developed 5 all star caliber players. Everyone from Kevin Durant and James Harden to Shai Gilegous-Alexander.  They'll be able to help him develop in ways the Warriors couldn't.
I was away from my phone in the bathroom with my AirPod in. I thought Lil’ Yachty was talking 🤣🤣🤣
If you listen and don’t watch it.. turner kinda sounds like a muppet lil yachty 😂
Is it me or does Evan turner sound like designer lol
Evan Turner sound like kermit the frog
Jorden Poole could always improve his handles. He could always improve his off-ball movement. He could always improve his shot selection/IQ. He wasn't. His discipline sucked. He was flapping his lips and not taking advantage of playing with HOF champions and listening.
Andre McNabb 🤣🤣🤣
What happen to the other guy that was on the show with jj?
I’m sorry man bur Evan turner got the worst voice of all time
Bet on Poole to be most improved next year
Jordan could have been heir apparent to steph 😂who knows maybe he'll be back after a year or two
He was his own enemy
Why this fool Turner sound like Lil Yachty 😂😂😂😂
I wanna hear Yachty and Evan turner have a convo😭
JJ's takes against past generations really annoys me as it usually comes off as disrespectful but in general the show and conversations are so enlightening, this show with Evan and Andre was great.
trying not to try thank you for addressing what dubs fans was seeing outside the scoring we just wanted bro to try on defense but to hear that from iggy a defensive master man that’s just crazy falling on purpose??
JJ u were my first favorite nba player as a kid I love to watch your podcasts ‼️
Without Poole warriors don't win the championship in 2022, period.
Glad jj was saying this in the beginning I haven watched the whole videocyet--, I use to tell ppl if Poole has 80pts I dnt care it wasn't a good game-he plays wild and out of control and Jack shots like he's steph I dnt kno if it was a fit in thing or what--I feel the same with harden he never won anything because of his style of play
Iggy...LOU WILLIAMS HAS THE BEST UNSUNG SHOES IN THE LEAGUE...PEAKS...SICK KICKS!!!
Wtf is Evan Turner talking about?
Klay was HORRIBLE in the postseason but no one wants to talk about it. He shot crazy from 3 all year and then went ghost. Sure JP could've played better but I expect more from the vet that's getting max dollars. Given the expectations I'd say Klay was an even bigger disappointment
love you andre
One guys voice sounds like he is part of a witness protection program
I thought that was lil Yachty
I wasn’t watching the video and I’m like why is lil yatchy on JJ podcast 😂
bro still that mean steph curry is trash as leader also green too (no heart feeling please) .... thanks for make this clear big respect
Jordan was a second leading scorer, as a third option, off the beach. That is very hard to do.
I thought that was Lil Yachty without looking at the screen
Y’all was bullying bro and he was still getting off just say that
I HATE Evan Turners voice
i love iggy bro. Wish he was still in Miami.
Evan Turner sound like a damn alien 😂
Klay Thompson was the 2nd leading scorer on the Warriors.
Real warriors fans know that Jordan only played good when he started. He was reckless with the ball and made too many turnovers. He was never able to get over the Draymond incident. Which is understandable, but in order to play well as a team. You have to have team chemistry. His bad attitude is why he was let go. Him and Draymond would never be able to get along, so one of them had to go for the betterment of the team💯
Does he have a frog in his throat?
Evans' voice annoys me. I see why he wasn't taken seriously. He's also extremely emotional
I’m tired of wanting to watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force clips after I watch content with Evan Turner on it… motherfucker sound like Meatwad and he needs to do something about it Lmfao 🤣 💀🤦🏾‍♂️
Bring Hedu Turk on the Podcast!!
Turners voice surprises me every time even though I know it’s coming.
Bro, listening to Evan turners voice is unbearable.
"I thought sometimes at times"😭
is ol boy in the middle wearing pearls?
there's something about Evan Turner that I just can't stand. He feels like a sore loser.
Even turner is like a jordan poole. Game and personality wise.
At the end of the day Poole was benched in the playoffs and a complete liability defensively. With Jordan Poole the biggest issue was his lack of effort on defense... and when he's having struggles on offense that issue is amplified 10x. Sucks that it played out the way it did but everyone won in the end... JP got paid and is now the #1 option on his team, Warriors got another championship.
Evan Turner sounds like lil Yatchy 😂
Didn't knew Kermit the frog balled as well
Lou catching strays 😂
Damn whos the guy from sesame street on the podcast? Guys voice is compressed
Evan Turner sounds like Lil Yachty x Meatwad
ET....the most under rated bust of all time 😂
I've always admired JJ's play, now I admire his take on a lot of subject matter regarding the nba
Am I tripping or does the other guy sound like lil Yachty
Hey Evan Turner, have you thought about working for Entertainment Tonight? You know all about who's sleeping with who lmao Evan is the REPORTER PRO STYLE.
The trying not to try part was my favorite quote in this 😂
This dude Evan always askin JJ if he is ok with what he said. Grow some nuts.
😂😂
Jordan is going to live out his potential as a barely above average nba player on a dogs hit team whose stats are higher than the actual skill of the player. I can't wait to never talk about him again lol
Iggy nail it, and warriors said do it somewhere else
I use to like jj, but then you turned into someone else. Devil got to you! I predicted that Jordan Poole purposefully made the Warrior's loose on purpose!! Why ask why, it's obvious. To get Draymond traded. To get himself paid. Jordan Poole, you talk the talk, then you push Draymond, of course he's going to defend himself and you disrespect him, I would knock your young a$$ out to!! Jordan Poole you are digging your own grave like Dame is. Egotistical fools. I'm sick of peoples ego's!! Until then, you'll Never Grow, facts. 😤. Even though I don't like jj, I still gave him a thumbs up! Learn Gratitude, Humility and Respect.
It feels like turner completly mismatches the vibe of Iggy and JJ
Green is mugger. Warriors are over.
Draymond Green is the most over rated player of my lifetime(38)...Think im crazy...look at his numbers side by side to Ben Simmons
Do Turner's two points relate to one another in any possible way?
When running your mouth goes wrong 😂😂😂. But hey he got 100 Million reason to not Gaf
Lou William's quote is great haha.
Why tf he sound like Lil Yatchy
He was the 2nd leading scorer bc klay was literally coming back from 2 near career ending injuries and didn't play til halfway through the season.
Two ways to look at. Poole should have played his role and he still got paid. They tried to put him starting and it never worked. Secondly, he probably was going to get traded anyways because they can't pay Steph, Klay, Dray, Wigs, looney and him what they are paying them without being taxed heavily because other owners can't beat them and don't reward the players that helps them win
CP is good only when he is healthy.  He is so injury prone that he is a seriously liability.
Draymond destroyed the locker room.  And they sacrificed Jordan Poole.  Jordan is the perfect back up/replacement for Klay.  I like Klay, but he is falling off fast.
Shoutout iggy for keeping it real. Need more of this
Watching Poole play was a better comedy stand up than Gringo Papi.
Love the show JJ glad to have ya back.
Evan turner sounds kinda like doc rivers lol
i clicked this madddd fast ... i need to know  why drsymond punched him ..
Let’s see how “real” he gets.  Jordan Poole was egotistical.  Dude would legitimately take Steph or Klays heat check from 35 feet for them as they just hit 3-4 shots in a row.  It looked like he wanted to be the star but wasn’t…… once he stopped playing his role they looked worse.  Now all that energy he had in GSW disappeared now that he’s in Washington.
I click on this so fast
Dude get knocked out and sent to Washington they did him dirty 😂😂😂
Pooles 285 turnover was enough 😆.
