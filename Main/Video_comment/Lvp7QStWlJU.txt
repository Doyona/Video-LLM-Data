If you can lil baby make this a song please I want a shoutout ⬇️  "Out the Mud"  (Intro) Yeah, it’s real, it’s that grind music I came from the bottom, man, I came from nothing, Now they see me shining, but they don’t know the struggle Real talk, yeah  (Verse 1) I came from the mud, they didn’t give me a hand, Had to get it myself, that’s the life of a man. I been through the pain, I been through the grind, Used to pray for a check, now it’s stacks all the time. I remember days I was broke, couldn’t eat, Now I’m stacking up, making moves every week. From the block to the stage, yeah, I’m climbing the peak, Used to dream about it, now it’s mine, no defeat.  I seen too many fall, they gave up too fast, But I stayed true, put my foot on the gas. It’s a marathon, no sprint, that’s the way that I move, I been through the struggle, so I’m never gonna lose. They told me I wouldn’t make it, said I’d never rise, But I flipped the script, look at the way I grind. Now I’m seeing the fruits, but it wasn’t overnight, It’s the hunger in my soul, I’ll be winning for life.  (Chorus) I came from the mud, I came from the dirt, Had to make it out, had to put in the work. Now they see me shine, but they don’t know the hurt, Came from the struggle, had to make it work. I’m all about the hustle, all about the grind, Put in the time, now I’m on my rise. Used to be down, now I’m up to the sky, Out the mud, I’m finna fly, I’m finna fly.  (Verse 2) I don’t play with my dreams, I turn 'em into reality, I made a way when it was nothing but casualties. Out the trenches, yeah, I moved with a strategy, Put my trust in my hustle, no time for fallacies. I know the pain, I know the struggle, I know the losses, But I came up, flipping dreams, no matter the cost. Used to pray for the money, now it’s stacking like trophies, Put my family on, now we living cozy.  Had the streets on my back, had the world on my shoulders, But I kept pushing, got stronger as I got older. I can’t let up, got too much on the line, I’m a different breed, put in the time, now I shine. They wanna see me down, but I’m breaking the chains, From the block to the riches, I’m rewriting the game. Used to dream of these nights when I was down on my luck, Now I’m up and it’s blessings, yeah, I’m running it up.  (Chorus) I came from the mud, I came from the dirt, Had to make it out, had to put in the work. Now they see me shine, but they don’t know the hurt, Came from the struggle, had to make it work. I’m all about the hustle, all about the grind, Put in the time, now I’m on my rise. Used to be down, now I’m up to the sky, Out the mud, I’m finna fly, I’m finna fly.  (Bridge) I used to wonder if I’d ever get the chance, Now I’m living dreams, I’m making real plans. Money, power, respect, but it’s more than the fame, It’s the legacy I’m building, remember my name. I came from nothing, now I’m stacking it tall, But I’m still the same, I’m still answering the call. It’s a long way up, but I’m made for the climb, I’ll be shining forever, and I’m taking my time.  (Verse 3) I’m a king in the making, ain’t no turning back, I’ll be standing tall while they crumble and crack. I’m solid, never fold, they can’t break my stride, I’ll be chasing dreams until the day I die. I been through hell, but I’m here to succeed, Came up from the struggle, now it’s all on me. I ain't scared of the grind, it’s a part of my soul, I turned pain into power, now I’m in control.  Got the world in my palms, it’s my time to flex, I’m taking what’s mine, no time to rest. From the city where the pain never seems to cease, I rose from the ashes, now I’m finally at peace. It ain’t about the money, it’s about the respect, I earned every dollar, I’m cashing the check. And I’ll be here forever, on top of the throne, Lil Baby, yeah, I’m finally home.  (Chorus) I came from the mud, I came from the dirt, Had to make it out, had to put in the work. Now they see me shine, but they don’t know the hurt, Came from the struggle, had to make it work. I’m all about the hustle, all about the grind, Put in the time, now I’m on my rise. Used to be down, now I’m up to the sky, Out the mud, I’m finna fly, I’m finna fly.  (Outro) Yeah, came from the mud, now I’m shining so bright, Put in the work, now it’s all in sight. From the block to the top, it’s a long road, But I made it through, yeah, I’m in control. Ain’t no turning back, I’m on a mission, Lil Baby in the building, it’s a transition. Out the mud, I’m finna fly, I’m finna fly.  What you think lil baby!
I speak English as my first language, and I can only understand about 50% of the words falling out of this dude's mouth.  No offense to this guy, but his music is awful.

Hi 😢😢😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
can you make a song for sonya massey, this how how she sadly got murdered while trying to take hot water off the stove.  family of Sonya Massey is calling for a probe into the hiring of a sheriff’s deputy charged with fatally shooting the 36-year-old Black woman in her Illinois home this month, citing their concerns over records showing he’d worked at six law enforcement agencies in four years and was charged with driving under the influence twice.  Sean Grayson, the 30-year-old Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy who has since been fired from the agency, was indicted by a grand jury on July 17 on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the July 6 shooting at Massey’s home near Springfield.

I like Lil Baby’s personality and he definitely has made some hits but I feel like a lot of his songs sound the same. I know he has HIS sound but the songs tend to sound similar with a similar flow. I wish he would switch it up or do something different. Fingers crossed tho!🤞🏽

You, Lil Pharma and Pfizer and others including the American Medical Association are insane to have frauded the world and collected $7.5 Billion a year and what paid medical doctors to look the other way, improperly treat, and kill 2.3 million innocent martyrs...and paid FBI and police to intimidate, arrest, and drug me for one as a person who said I know what this shit is when you targetted me with your murder weapon of covid.

https://youtu.be/okUTbKXnoBk?feature=shared
Ya you better than you daddy son yesterday I told you he was going to be number one
You forget those that supported you to get you to the top. You bit and chewed the fingers that fed you.  Your potential was 100M+ views almost reaching the 1B + 💔  Until you humble yourself and apologise, the world won’t love you the same again.  Take my advice! You don’t deserve to look like an “NLE CHOPPA”  You might as well cut your hair off if you don’t listen or care 💋💔
You need gunna brudda
Lil baby never disappoints

Your music keeps me going bro; crazy how much we think a lot alike. Hope living in fame is better than living in poverty for you. Ya know, besides all of the interviews and people throwing hate on your name. Truth is, they just don't understand because they choose not to. They'd rather see you fall than to rise. I hope you make it to the top and stay there bro

Man do rap and not mumble shit the vibe is killa but this mumble shot is a virus in us new school
Dominique, don't forget where you came from my friend, you are a humble person always have been, but for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. some people, eager for money, have wondered from faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. remember "idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring riches".
Yesssssirrrrrr..!!
Just got my approval... Lil baby go hard in anything he do...
Your sublime voice and your look make you the king 🤴 of rap!! Strong💪

Brothers and sisters, let's remember the grace of our Savior. Repentance is the path to His love and mercy. 🙏🏻 Turn to Him, for in Romans 10:9 it says, 'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.' May His peace guide your journey. 🕊️ #RepentAndBelieve #SeekChrist

ESPAÑOL LYRIC  Kanye está loco por eso, no voy a jugar con eso No soy una tía cuando hablo de este documento Tú Puedes jugar si quieres. Les dejo decir lo que quieran. Estoy listo para toda esta mierda. No importa lo difícil que pueda ser. Ese chico está en la parte superior de la lista. Levanté una pared y bloqueé todo esto. mierda Mantente en pie, no puedo caer ni un poquito Mataron a mi hombre, todos estábamos un poco enfermos Intenta llegar a un punto en el que todos podamos hacernos ricos Ve hasta el final, no hay forma de detener esta mierda Ellos Respétalo, por supuesto, pero todavía hay un poco de tensión (Espera) Todavía en el corte, solo oscurezco los tintes (Espera eso) Hay un trofeo en cada una de mis muñecas Cuida de cada una de mis perras . Joder, poner mi corazón en esta mierda, pero te agotaste. Joder, ¿parezco que te dejaré superar? Nunca hablo sobre la almohada. Obtienen una fianza, los rescatan. ¿ Cuántos cobras por enviar por correo? Tan pronto como aterricen, nos vamos a vender. Espero que los sellos de vacío mantengan el olor fuera. Snitch de la pandilla, eres un vendido . Traté de decirles que "se relajen". Supera todas las pruebas, puedes salir. Mantén esa mierda puesta cuando salgas Solo va en una dirección (a mi manera), siete millones en un día, sí (Flash) Ejecútalo e invierte en mierda. El corazón se rompió cuando lo enfermaron. No puedo encontrar tiempo para relaciones Van Cleef, pulseras Cartier Soy una estrella fugaz, puedes pedir un deseo ¿ Empiezas a sentir que fui hecho para esto? Si no lo hacen, yo lo haré, veo la vida tal como es. Intenta gastar un doblaje en una cuna. Hacer más tiempo para mi hijo. Todos con quienes estoy. Gastarlo cuando sea el momento de gastarlo. (Gastarlo). Enviar. Ellos cuando sea el momento de ser enviados (Envíalo) Uh, el bebé se abrió camino. Quieren crédito por cosas que no hicieron. Ella volvió afuera, estoy en el campo . Si te atrapo, sabes lo que es. Así es, ella se hace cargo del negocio (yo no juego) Sí, claro, tú estás en el medio (yo no juego) Te dejan ahí por cruzar la valla (estúpido) Estoy preparado para lo que sea que envíen
Bro gets more unreleased viewers than ur favorite rappers singles…….
Kanye crazy 'bout it, I ain't gon' play about it Not a broad when I'm talkin' 'bout this paper You can play if you want to I let 'em say what they want to, I'm ready for all of this shit No matter how hard it can get That boy on the top of the list I put up a wall and block all of this shit Stay on my feet, I can't fall a lil bit They killed my man, we was all a lil sick Tryna get to a point where we all can get rich Go all the way, ain't no stoppin' this shit They respect it of course, but it's still a lil' tension (Hold on) Still in the cut, I just darken the tints (Hold that) There's a trophy on every last one of my wrists Take care of every last one of my bitches I fuck around, put my heart in this shit, but you sold out Fuck I look like letting you get over? I never talk on the pillow They get a bond, they get bailed out How many you chargin' to mail out? Soon as they land, we gon' sell out Hope vacuum seals keep the smell out Snitch on the gang, you a sellout I tried to tell 'em to "Chill out" Beat all the trials, you can get out Keep that shit on when you step out It's only goin' one way (My way), seven mill' in one day, yeah (Flash) Run it up and invest in shit Heart broke when they made him sick Can't find time for relationships Van Cleef, Cartier bracelets I'm a shootin' star, you can make a wish Startin' to feel like I was made for this? If they don't, I will, I see life for what it is Tryna spend a dub on a crib Make some more time for my kid Everybody solid who I'm with Spend it when it's time to get spent (Spend it) Send 'em when it's time to get sent (Send it) Uh, Baby made a way for himself They want credit for shit they ain't did She back outside, I'm in the field If I catch you, you know what it is That's right, she get the biz' (I don't play) Yeah right, you in the middle (I don't play) You get left there for straddlin' the fence (Stupid) I'm prepared for whatever they send

Big hairy balls
Baby wack
We trust in lil baby

Don’t let this throwaway baby song distract you from the fact that Lil Baby is a peon used to promote degeneracy among the young. He brings children to clubs and humps with billionaires. For everyone to see, so you can’t disagree. Listen to who you want but baby is blacklisted to me. He stands with the industry not with the people
🔥🔥🔥
Faygo
Only 360k damn I remember baby was doing crazy numbers

Finishing a full song of this 2 year old baby mumble rapper is like dragging forks over a clean plate, it sounds like this whole song is a feature. Little infant needs to take inspiration from travis scott. This infant is the same child wants $200,000 just for an interview... clown

La razón por la que tiene éxito Lil  Baby es porque su música es auténtica. Construyó una base de fans leales basándose en la coherencia y sin tratar de sonar como todos los artistas. Rezo para que algún día mi música pueda llegar a masas como Lil Baby. ¡Él es mi mayor inspiración!
The money is making you soft.you’ve lost your magic we now listening you’ve established the lil baby’s name very well..GO HARDER .This ain’t the lil baby that we knew
It’s only going one way ☝️

Don’t let Up 🤞🏽

Lil Baby always delivering
Imma be real with you you're gonna have to change up your sound or style, experiment. Like if you need a reference  look at Tyler the creator, Kendrick Lamar, Cole, Kanye, Thug, Future, Carti, Uzi, etc. You need to change it up if you still want a long career in this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Baby it’s time to switch it up or you gon fall off. Seriously.
