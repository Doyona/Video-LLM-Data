i miss Carlo so much
The fact that we were 2nd in the league half way through the season and ended up being 10th
All thanks to Carlos_1uptrades on !G  for helping me to trade my $400 into Bitcoin and I was credited with the sum of $5400 after seven working days of my trade with him now I’m debt free I can settle my bills without even touching my paycheck I’m so happy with Bitcoin life is easy 😊..

It is clear, if Carlo manage to balance this version of the team (strong defence, quick contra attack)with the version of the first five games (possession and attacking football), Everton will become a real candidate to the title.
Everton💙💙💙 champion 🏆

Dominic calvert did not score the first goal or even touched the ball. Obviously by slow motion he did not change the direction of the ball . We can see that clearly from different side of the camera
1:57 I got no more stress with the help of, *e a s y j o b s o n l i n e .c l u b*
I swear to god I saw the word laughing at the title for a split second.. then gone
My village team would easily beat this shi**y Arsenal team😂😂
Give Ancelotti new player like Isco and Khedira
Jgn malu terlihat miskin, tapi malu lah jika kalian  menjadi fans Arsendal 🤣
Penontone udah bnyak

PERCAYA PROSES..!!          PROSES DEGRADASI WKWKWK
That cross from Iwobi was fantastic, at Arsenal Iwobi was constantly abused by fans and called names, fans even suggested he is not good enough to play for a GREAT CLUB  like Arsenal, look at him now. It is time Arsenal fans come to their senses because Arsenal may be average for a very long time  and you guys stop abusing players .
Kuch jastokkkk....
So far, 5 pastors killed in my village just for testing their mic 1-2   1-2.

These 'highlights' miss out the PENALTY and also Luis hitting the post when Pickford does his usual thing at the end. Huuuum....Honestly Everton, you'd be going places if you had a keeper.
Ozil mana ozil.😀😀😀😀
James es  como la mala suerte

Why do you insist on showing the scoreline in the description? At least allow us to watch the highlights without knowing thr result. I live in Australia and watch Sunday morning. You've spoilt so many games for us by doing this!
WE THE PEOPLE!
Goodjob arteta...!!!
Ancurancuran
sumpah bingung banget sama regulasi fifa, pas pemain bola masuk lapangan tidak ada jabatan tangan dan pemain cadangan di pisahkan jarak 3 M dgn alasan menghindari virus covid, terus pas udah tanding rebut bola nya saling seging. percuma ngentot gk guna
Carlo magnifico carlo fantanstico
Ozil very hppy
Uyeeeeaacchh victory
Ancelotti was a legend before he got to Goodson, but man he is just the real deal. Also, Ben Godfrey is looking a terrific signing, great game.
Arsenal is a joke
Why Arsenal?? worst history for the arsenal..
Arteta out,
Other than the RS, Arsenal is the team I'd most like to see relegated.
Arsenal kalah, auto click. Create peluang teroooos wkwkwk
congratulation team.
Arsenal lose I click
Too much of backing for Arteta, under Pep he was the best but don't know why he isn't able to manage arsenal, when u have a star striker like auba then u need to give excellent passes which Ozil can do, tell Ozil to shut about the world matters and let him play. Other than that I don't see a flaw and all the matches u guys played was on spot just that we were Outta luck.
Good job arteta...bring my club into the hell...
go arsenal
Arsenal making nice money this nice  gambling
I hope arsenal get relegation this season, so they can get a chance to win a trophies for championship next season 🙏
Inilah akibatnya pemirsa, demi bisnis rela menyingkirkan ozil yang sangat peduli saudaranya
Underrated last second save from picks
Ancellotti is Everton's best signing. Class
Bye2 arsenal.smaile ozile
how big the black guy from guachene doing those goals head
Ozil ozil

Joss ton
I stand together with don carlo
Di obok obok haha
Arteta kintil
"Permainannya arsenal sudah ada proggres, lumayan bisa created peluang juga para pemain sudah menunjukan etos kerja di bawah Arteta. Tapi ya football is football Everton ini lagi lucky aja ibarat lu shot atau headen asal juga bakal goal, apalagi pelatih asal Italia kaya Anceloti yg menghalalkan semua cara buat menang walau ugly win, tpi ya mereka nanti perlahan bakal kembali ke habitatnya sedangkan gw liat Arsenal pelan-pelan bisa naek ke atas ya at least 6 besar. ok segitu saja, thanks for waching"  -Kuch yang ga nge Kuch
I'm liverpool fans but when I see the news that ancelotti became everton manager, I believe that everton gonna be be lit and that's happening now.. Congrats for everton fans
Arsenal will keep suffer, as long as they dont apologize to Ozil, and play him.. Poor arsenal..
Everton is strong now and they have   a fantastic goalkeeper:  Pickford. Congrats. Hope they can be in the next Champions League session.
Yerry mina👏🏼👏🏼🎄
I hope Arsenal get relegated
Arsenal next season: Champions league ✖️ Championship ✔️  😂😂🤭
Arteta : Arsenal this season without ozil   Result : hahaha
Thankiyu for beating arsenal...
Ehe
But Y🙆
Merseyside is REDD !
Arsenal losing 😄 yeah
Lo bueno es que James no es fundamental en el planteamiento de este club, de hecho tienen 3 victorias de seguidas sin el en cancha.
7-0 nyimak
Championship menunggumu gunners...
Yerry Mina... I have enjoyed his goals back in 2015 with Independiente Santa Fe. He is still a beast in England!
Diobok obok
arsenal deserved this all along this seasons...because the way you treat your players..ozil curse..

Hahahaha jastok palkon😀
Arsenal about to leave the league real talk
GG dude..
Calvert is that project mate that does nothing but claims all the effort.
Arsenal fix down to championship of league
Apoyando desde México 🇲🇽🔵🔵
I knew when carlo took over there would be a Complete turn around.. Don carlo.. Best manager in the world, cv says so.. The school of science and the manager to go with it.. ETID.. NSNO..
Arsenal really want to add golden championship trophy in their cabinet 😭
Everyone banging balls in against Arsenal like they were in Pentonville.
Ancur ancuran.
💙💙
Barcelona was stupid selling this guy he didn't even get to play
It probably won't happen, but imagine if Tottenham win the league and Arsenal get relegated.
godfrey is actually a belter fullback
Ancelloti transformed these players man wow🔥🔥
Mr Arteta Ozil fait quoi sur le banc ...
Everton have 2 worldclass playmaker and best striker in premiership this season...
David Luiz hitting the post, shouldn’t that be in the highlights?
🇨🇴🇨🇴 thanks to yerry mina they won
Good Everton amazing
ggwp everton, arsenal fans right now....
Kasian arsenal dilatih arteta berantakan
I hope arsenal degradation
Why weren't james rodriguez in team list?? He is injury, where is a problem?
Says ozil: thanks everton🤣
Wkwk arsendallll
Great play from Everton..
Semogamusim ini arsenal degradasi.Aamiin
YERRY CHRISTMAS! VAMOS PANITA!! 🇨🇴🔵💙COYB💙🔵
See you on champions(hip) league
Go go Everton
ARTETA OUT
I’m telling you, it is Everton’s lucky era to even get Ancelotti to manage them. He is a proven winner. Everton must never sack him when they go through a bad spell in future.
Predicted that Arsenal will be in the relegation zone soon!!
Arsenal should just move to another league.
Hope arsenal is relegated this season, LOL
Let's pray for arsenal
Arsenal have forgotten how to win
Arsenal lagi ampas
They shall change the club name with Artrophy/Arwinner.
Alhamdulillah
The James effect  They have got a boost of confidence after signing him
Arsenal really need a miracle or they'll be playing in championship nxt season..... Thats when they will get back to winning ways
2 boring  team playing  boring  football
