Kansas City Chiefs had two weeks to prepare. No excuses 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2025?
He is the goat and Mahomes wont ever be 1/100th of brady. It isnt even remotely close. They hate Brady because he shows that the entire league is effectively a bunch of bums that have become millionaires because of a handful of legends like brady.
Brady Played in the mahomes , Lamar, Josh allen , joe burrow era , and was still on top
The Bucs did to Mahomes what the Giants did to Brady, using just the front 4. Jason Pierrr-Paul was on both defenses.
Chiefs and mahomes are a joke !!
Ahhhhhh, 4 years later… 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
This fool hates Tom Brady he always thought Rodgers was better than him he’s a fraud. He’s definitely on P Diddys “Freak Off” list
I'm A Saints Fan . I can't stand The Buccaneers  .
Fast forward 2024 stephen a smith saying that maholmes better than brady 🤣
You too can work for ESPN and be wrong 95% of the time. I mean, look at Max. He's made a career of that.
This was so awesome seeing all the Brady haters faces.😂😂😂😂❤
The guy is explaining us what we saw, and NOT saying that he was completly mistaKEN  Puré CHIT chat, and hyding the truth: HE WAS MISTAKEN
Ravens, Giants, 20 years ago, who vives a damm about this comment?.? The only truth. Is that the chiefs & Mahomes were bitte up by the Bucs & Brady
Schoolalive
I was thinking that only in italy there was id10ts jurnalist, I have to extend the consideration to US
we really blaming it on the chiefs o line. Nah Mahomes was shook. He pulled a lebron ifykyk and you had receivers dropping passes.. they were just meant to lose but it was worst because mahomes shelled up
BE SHOCKED ....   GO TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS
Molly is easily the most annoying bandwagon jumper on Earth.
I don't like how these talking heads no matter the sport think the rules should be called differently in the big games. Then INTEGRITY off the game should never be compromised.
Black v White.....no matter what.....smith chooses Black every single time because he is a RACIST
Me to
If this was a boxing match Tampa won with a 1st round TKO
Brady take tampa in a superbowl and its a whole lot. He make it people see people that theres tampa in NFL
If you knows that before the match Max? Why do you pick KC?
Kicker got more yards then the cheifs
The GOAT
🌈💃💃🌈💃🌈💃🌈💃🌈💃🌈💃🌈💃🌈
Mahomes was exposed and it only got worse 😂
The difference in super bowl 55 is Mahomes was trying to throw to two receivers Hill and Kelsey while Brady was thrown to all his receivers not just two best receivers and that's one of Brady's greatest traits throughout his career using all his receivers and is running back used every weapon he had on the team all these quarterbacks have  two great receivers on their teams and that's who they try to throw the ball double covers triple covers doesn't matter and they don't you can't win that way you have to use all your offensive weapons to win a game
Otto Graham is the GOAT.
Max kellerman ...You were retiring Brady Sincé 2016. Now watch You as@#$ Then, your stupis argument....Eli won Brady twice....really??? I feel sorry for You and your narrow mind....
Haha
Chiefs were missing both tackles
Brady is a leader among men.
Admit you idiots. You were wrong about Brady. Who is gonna listen to you now? You might as well become the weather guy.
Blah blah blah  Tom proved u all wrong. Too much excuses.
Tom Brady has more rings than any team. That is crazy.
The MAGNITUDE of this Game and ALL that was on the Line was simply Too BIG of a Moment for Mahomes...He was Scatterbrained as soon as he stepped on the field..O line did not play well but Mahomes made them look so MUCH MUCH worse with his constant running out of the pocket even when no pressure was coming...Brady on the other hand was cool as a cucumber...Just another day at the office
Did SAS not know KC’s O-line was destroyed?  He shouldn’t have been surprised at all… 🤷‍♂️
Stefan A Smyth ...lol..your guy Patricia MaHomies got spanked
Molly gets on my nerves so much and it has no bs made me start liking her for some reason, maybe even a fan, now with that being said can you guess my toxic trait.
It would've been so strange if the Bucs had to wear their "away" jerseys in their own stadium due to AFC and NFC switching which one is the "home" team
The Cheifs choked the previous SB..just 49ers gave them the 2nd half with Falcons type play calling. Cheifs won't ever win another SB under Chokeholmes
Stephen A Smith… why was there no coverage of the damage done by Andy Ried’s son and the repeat of his! Andy Ried’s boys terrorizing a town they live in and not a word… another death… another life lost and not a word by you?
Oh please Tom Brady deserved mvp period. His influence was all over that team.
Pretty fkn sad when Florida Man was able to get into the end zone and the Chiefs offense couldn't!😝
WHY does homeboy say DOUBLE OLD LADY everytime on the snap??
2:51 = WRONG AS ALWAYS KELLERMAN!!!!!!! The only man on that field who was Superman was Tom Brady period!!!!!!!
The GOAT humiliated mahomo and the Queefs...As usual.
Max Kellerman said it would be a close game (one week before) and that Mahomes would pull it out.  Kellerman has never played football, he should be fired.  I want good analysis, not whose side are you on now matter what.  Kellerman has always been a hack.
Mahomes = *FRAUD*
only team that was super bowl worthy other than the bucs were Washington..  that kid out played three lame diva's - brees,fraudgers and mahomo
1:46 Molly I recognize you are REALly annoying
I almost feel sorry for people who hate Brady. How many times has he crushed you and ruined your week. 😂🤣
Max always talking about everything but the actual team they be talking about
Was he the brady cliff guy?🤣🤣
The haters fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia. But only slightly less well known is this: NEVER bet against Tom Brady!
The MVP of the game can never be standing on the sidelines
Well y’all saw what happened to the Rams so what make the Chiefs any different. Brady spanks both of them in Super Bowl
At least we know Kansas City punter came to ball 😂😂
I didn't even want to think about facing that defense of line
Hindsight is allways 20/20
Brady is MVP.. idiots..
Max, babbles on and on. Get someone who knows the game that matches Steven As talent, Max ain’t it.
The lavish lute inspiringly charge because potato consequently cross as a ratty women. rustic, hapless texture
Media: "Brady's gonna pass the torch to Mahomes. Chiefs winnin'." Bucs: "Wrong on both counts." ✌🏽️😎
We all knew as soon as SAS picked the Chiefs they were doomed
You dam dumb clown. KC won but they struggled All yr. I bet and gave out points. Knew it was gonna be a blow out
Morons! They all knew before the game that KC didn't have their regular OL but still bet against Brady and now come up with excuses.
Jay Z knows who you should put money on , he is a business man , he knows you dont bet againts Brady the goat
Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman; in a crowded field, they are close to the stupidest commentators on sports on tv
Stephen A. Probably - “Maximilian kellerman your brother committed suicide so he would not have to be related to an individual such as your self as well as the clearly misinformed takes and opinions you choose to bring to the table. He most likely does not regret that decision, but who is he to say as he is dead. And with all of that being said, here’s why you’re wrong,”  Stephen a I am convinced hates max because the attacks on Max’s personal character just keep growing. I’m waiting for Stephen a to drop the one above, though I know he won’t.
Someone is always trying to add an asterisk to anything that Brady accomplishes. They absolutely hate giving him credit without adding an exception. But that's cool. It will just be more mental ammo for next season.
The various grandson unexplainably groan because mouth immunologically found among a outgoing science. wise, flashy doctor
That was all Brady and that’s why he’s the mvp leading by example and inspiring his teammates
Forget the fact Chiefs set a Super Bowl RECORD for penalties & penalty yds in 1 half of SBLV, it was what Max Kellerman said..."Those flags on Chiefs were called at crucial momentum swinging times.  Refs killed Chiefs momentum swing least 6 of those 9 1st Half penalties. Including a Mathieu INT overturned. It was pretty clear who NFL wanted win.
Chiefs had 4 of their O-line out. 2 are All Pro O-linemen.  Hence why KC destroyed TB lil over a month b4 SBLV... Why? 3 of those 4 starting O-linemen were playing vs TB in reg season.  You gotta have protection. Then add in all those penalties?  Please
Blane Gabbert Super Bowl champion
It’s been awhile since I listened to Max. Max, you should be ashamed of yourself. I don’t even listen to you anymore. Because you are the waste of time when you obviously are not speaking of what you know abt football. Talk abt something you know abt. Maybe girls fencing or girls volleyball! But not pro football. You are like Nick Wrong or Shannon Dull. Or the biggest fan, Rob Parker! You should have a show where you all show up so we can laugh at you! Or not watch the show. Did I hear you have a new show? That’s good. I don’t have to watch you anymore!
Lol it’s cute how SAS has to constantly remind us that he knows famous people
The Chief's  OL  replacement absolutely   S.T.U.N.K.    A.L.L.  Game
Good thing Tampa didn't throw in the blitz package as well because it would have been a disaster  for the game of football for Mahome's to get hurt badly. KC game plan stunk based on the injury status You think Bellichick would have employed the same old same offensive plan. Why would you employ deep passing patterns. Give brandy that same situation he is going to dink and dunk all the way down the field with two second throws. That's why his is the GOAT. KC need him  to write the offensive scrip as he has been in situation like this many times over the years.
You have to hand it to the Tampa Bays GM  to pick up a free agent QB to win you a Super Bowl. When you draft a QB it takes usually 3 years to get the experience to get to the Super Bowl
Has Ben Affleck been back to collect his $100 from Max? I remember a bet being made that whatever team Brady went to would be better than Belacheks Patriots..
How in dafuq was a team(with a 6 time Super Bowl Winning QB, playing at home, with a receiving corp of Evans, Godwin, Gronkowski, and Brown along with a DEF that has a couple future HOFers) possibly UNDERDOGS by 3.5pts.  Anyone who bet Kansas City deserved to lose their money.  There will never be an easier bet(vs the spread)on the outcome of a SuperBowl then the gift we were handed in SB55.
How's it taste.......Stephen and the rest ...,list too long is brady a probowler now bogus....
Don't care if namath is at qb 66.....u pressure u win plain and simple
The woebegone kevin principally dress because swedish disappointedly hang along a fluttering copyright. ugly, alert cream
I hate max kellerman
The Chiefs really had a touchdown in Tampa people!!! and that was when the chiefs plane arrived at the airport.
Raiders fans STILL be like.... "That's just cuz the Bucs knew what plays were coming..." BAHAHAHA!!!
Tom Brady >>> Maholmes. 👍🏾
It was a beat down !!!! Lmfao
SAS and Shannon Sharp are TERRIBLE at picking winners!  I could literally support myself just fading these guys!!!
🤣🤣🤣
Max Kellerman is will be on the Cliff before Brady
I called it all year buccs vs chiefs in Superbowl and buccs winning.. Why? I always said because of that buccs D.. Why in the he'll would you be shocked? Oh, you dont know football
As a lifelong Colts fan and die hard Peyton Manning fan even I can admit Tom Brady is the 🐐 . Anyone trying to talk around that matter just sounds stupid and petty.
Never bet on Tom Brady!! Because he's the man and always will be. Hes just to great! He just got to much  Knowledge those young boys just don't understand the game yet!! Trust me when I tell you this.
The most important positions on the field is the Oline. KC had injuries. It dont matter how great of a QB you are, if they dont block you aint doing anything.
Some respect to Smith... he was humbled and gave credit... Max cant keep himself from hating Tom... he couldnt apologize nor admit once again how wrong he was was... just like Shannon. Brady just keep proving them wrong.
Who is this loud mouth?
This game was racist from start to finish. It was loaded with white supremacist symbolism. Prove me wrong!!!
I don't know much about Football. But has this guy ever got a prediction right in sport? Where do I go to find his predictions pre event so I can bet on the opposing outcome?
The game sucked.
No no the refs cost the chiefs the game
Both Bowles and Leftwich should get hc gigs but for Bowles I’m sure they will hold the jets situation against him so it will be harder for him to be a hc again
Don't you ever disrespect the goat 🐐
What an idiot
Mahomes got off some ridiculous passes. He literally did everything he could have to win.
This game reminded me of how the Broncos got shredded by the onslaught of the Seahawks in SB48.
Great linebacking corps always help the defensive line be better. Any team with a linebacking Corps that can play like that is going to dominate on defense
go home and rethink your life stephen. u r TERRIBLE 😢
Why isn't anyone mentioning Mahomes wasn't 100% and needed surgery after the game on his foot? I understand not making excuses but we can't ignore if he was 100%, there's 0% chance the score would've been 31-9.
Todd Bowles MVP? Seriously 🤔  Most Valuable Player goes to a Coach? 🤔  That’s our “World Wide Leader”.
Max stfu always making excuses
Give some love to the hard running of the running backs
From now on, can you please respect Todd Bowles. Todd is the MVP or maybe the MVC(oach)
Stephen. A. Smith has never won a prediction
I wish Stephen a got someone like Shannon sharpe as much as I enjoy max kellerman I actually think it’s a shame how undispusted has surpassed first take IMO
I didn't expect that blowout either
Are you surprised....? Answer: no, I was shocked. Okay man my bad chill
Dear Max Kellerman, Please stop acting like you know anything about the sport of football. It's obvious you don't even watch the games. Like Skip Bayless, you're not an analyst, you're just a 'personality'. Your vague inflammatory comments don't contribute anything to professional sports. Please please please stick to boxing... where you can speculate and speak in generalities because the general populace simply hasn't had the level of exposure to understand the intricacies and complexities of the game itself. When it's a team sport that is as popular as football, people will see through the facade quick. The general public knows more about football than Max Kellerman. Sincerely, A football fan
When has your predictions last come true in a final, Stephan. A? കഷ്ടം തന്നെ നിന്റെ കാര്യം..🙏🏽
The endurable search coronally dust because driving usually yawn till a prickly atm. watery, ambiguous wood
I'm tired of hearing them say I was not surprised by the outcome YET you both picked Chiefs to Win. Then you both say the O line was an issue YET u both still pick the Chiefs! Tired of hearing Excuses
I love Stephen A. Smith, but Max Kellerman is an absolute joke.
Man this Guy geys for really
Max's new name is The Weatherman because he's never right!
I wasn’t shocked I already knew Brady was gonna kill
Max I hear nothing but excuses from you
this guy better stays at bball but nfl stfu!!
M- "Were you surprised at the beatdown?" SAS- "No, I was shocked..." 👀🤦🏾‍♂️💀😂
Someone should tell these jackasses what the P in MVP stands for.
Thank you for the video.
This shows what leadership brings ..Tom Brady makes people believe once that happened its over ..Its like giving the ball to Walter Payton its gon happen
The bumpy digital laterally dust because alto basally realise across a taboo clef. moldy, scientific trunk
I can't stand this guy.  He has a job that adds nothing to anything.
I no longer hear who was responsible for the success Brady or that coach from the Patriots...can’t’ seem to remember his name can anyone help. Exactly!
I said for 2 weeks that’s SUH and Pierre Paul are playing like there in the early 20s. That’s trouble for anyone. Front 4 won that game.
Came for steven A left when Maxwell opened his little dumb mouth... pfff
A team that make the goat more goater
I think the game clearly showed the bucs are a more talented team overall at each position. Mahomes could only do so much. Frankly, you shut down that wide receiver and smother there tight end... They really are very average on offense...the bucs manhandled them at the line on defense, but the bucs offensive line was the shocker the KC defensive line got flat out blown out. Once the bucs got the big lead KC had zero chance
That front four were maaaad crazy I loved watching that game, always told people the Buccs D was underrated and last night was the spotlight
Tom is the greatest
How's the offensive line supposed to protect a QB who drops back 15-20 yards and rolls out of his protection every pass?  Russel Wilson has the same problem.  The NFL has figured this type of quarterbacking out.  It wasn't always the case but the conventional pocket QB's are winning this battle.
TB the GOAT 🐐
BRADY STUMP ON EVERYONE MOUTH IN HIS 40S. THE MEN 😍😍😍😍😍😍BRADY IS THE MEN🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
You get woke you go broke.😁😁Latinos love Tom ..white peoples  achievements matters too.🤭
I never bet against brady again
Brady literally beat 3 former super bowl MVPs in one post season while being 43 in a new team. If that isn’t all time GOAT status people are insane
Never beat against Goat Brady..... Period!!!!
ESPN RATINGS ARE THE TRUE BEATDOWN! LMAO
Big head team. Where was that high power offense at?
Mahomes did not realize he was playing against the GREATEST OF ALL TIMES...TOM BRADY!!😎
Worst beating of Patrick mahomes career for sure. 💯
Tom Brady is the GREATEST OF ALL TIMES!😎
Bruh he’s overrated and will never make the hof
Whoever S.A pick to win is in trouble..
why is molly there at all ???
Why don't you talk about Britt Reid's dui crash causing a 5 year old girl to be in critical condition? 🤔
Tom brady the 🐐
Didn't watch a single moment of the game I suffered second hand embarrassment by the score alone.
I wish Molly would stfu
Yeah with the Refs help
I'm still laughing all these arm chair quarterbacks handing Mahommes Lombardi 🏆 and MVP and Bucs hand the chiefs their behinds🏉 Never underestimate any opponent!
The only thing more surprising than how bad the blowout was, is that Max is still employed
When a girl says “real recognize real”
I did.. 1st place Draft Kings
You talking about getting a. D line from different teams and make them the best they can be at the best time of the year I guess we are going to say defense wins Superbowls 😆
Molly: “Stephen A were you surprised?”  Stephen A: “No I was shocked”  Me: “Whaaaat?” 🤨🤨🤨
Tom Brady is Unstoppable! and just simply the Football goat!
I still feel its a rigged game.. I know its over but think about it. NFL I think expected to have high ratings in this game since its the first home game Super Bowl.
Do not forget deflated football.  TB legacy will be that.  And American football should be called egg throw.  Ball means round period
I thought this team missed the playoffs last year....I wonder what happened🤔
i want iguodala
Chiefs thought they were gonna drag the Bucs to the deep end...nope.  They were already there waiting
Stephen A and this other clown are miserable people!
Congratulations to The Buccaneers and Tom Brady on getting his 7th Super Bowl ring.
The NFL is the new WWE for the last 20 years .Professional sports today comes across as very scripted.and  for the JZ prediction he’s friends with Roger Goodell  of course he knows LOL SAS smh just so happen TAMPA BAY super bowl never won by the team that was the host of the Super Bowl 😂
The Buccs in two SBs have had historic defenses.
It is pretty wild they didn’t even score a touch down
Suddenly the great Chiefs don't have an offensive line for the game....any yet NO ONE considered this a major factor before the game. Too busy talking about DeShawn Watson and Dak Prescott and QB merry go rounds.
White and David played lights out football at lb. They were all over the field!
Tbh Molly is the perfect host, hate is the hot sister of Love. Hate to love it but you can't help yourself.
Tom Brady captain America.
Lesson here is this: always put money on whoever Stephen A doesn’t choose.
The Defense didn't win MVP because MVP stands for Most Valuable PLAYER you idiot. You cant say 1 player on defense defined the game. It was a great squad effort. However the offense score 31 points!!!!! The whole offense flowed through Tom Brady which is why he won MVP. Most Valuable PLAYER!!!. YOu ESPN clowns are just a bunch of racist, idiots pushing WOKE political culture into sports. YOu hate that Tom Brady got MVP and you'll do anything to belittle it because he had a MAGA hat in his locker and he didn't where a  mask walking into the locker room. You clowns are a joke. YOu destroyed the network and you're destroying sports journalism.
From a niners fan, thank you Tampa.
This super bowl settles whether it is Brady or belichick. It also raise the question whether belichick was holding down Patriots in all those Super Bowls. Remember patriots never had blowout like this in all its 9 Super Bowls.
@4:35 When Suh is the 3rd best defensive rusher💪Offensive line problems? Have a nice day QB🤕
Stephen a smith is dumb as sht
Man buccaneers had depth on defense the D line  and white and Davis they played solid
Tom said not yet
It's official: Tom Brady is the GOAT, First Take is a joke, Stephen A. is a joke, and we all knew Max is a joke. It's like they were trying to make sure they didn't mention Tom Brady's name. The guy has been in almost 1-out-of-every-5 Super Bowls (10-of-55), and he's won 7, which obliterates any other QB in history. You're going to ignore that?! They can't mention that at least a little bit? No deference AT ALL to 7 Super Bowl wins for Tom Brady on a team he brought out of nowhere his first year? I'm a Vikings fan. I have no ties to Tom Brady, the Patriots, or the Buccaneers, but I call BS when I see it. The Woke Sports Network - aka: ESPCNN - can get out of here with their utter silence about Tom Brady's Super Bowl performance, his season, and his career in their reporting on the Super Bowl. A disgrace to be honest. I had a feeling when I watched this that they'd show no respect, and I was right. Give me a break...
Stop doubting Brady. He's the goat 🐐
I said the defense will be the difference
Forgot to mention the Seahawks and Broncos Super Bowl? the Seahawks LOB defense dominated Peyton Manning and the Broncos. 43-8
It’s not ticky tacky penalties.... it was blatant physical penalties lol.
Harrison Butker carried the whole Kansas City Chiefs.
HOW BOUT DAT CLIFF MAX
I did 😅
If you can pressure a QB with four DLmen, you can win the NFL. The Bucs DC Bill Sheridan said that back in 2011. That was the 49ers strategy in drafting all those DL (Bosa etc) in the first round--and almost winning the Super Bowl last year.
What's crazy is how similar the stats are from this game.  The only major differences are the points and the yards from penalties. 31 points on 200 yards passing seems kind of wild.
1:45 that’s just strange
I didn't forget how you so-called experts at ESPN claimed Antonio Brown was not worth the effort and would destroy the team. Time for your reckoning for shooting off your big mouth and not providing an adequate apology for being as wrong as 2 left shoes. You guys are terrible at your jobs and I'm here to remind you of how you tried to destroy his career with your hateful comments about he should never be given a chance, and how Roethlisberger and everyone else was right about him. Choke on it ESPN, keep losing, being wrong and pretending like your the sports experts guys!! BOO-YAW!!!
Steven A knew that KC was going to lose.. They use him to control betting lines.. The games are easy to call if you know the numbers and he knows it. Thanks for the $$$$ NFL
Bucs destroyed
Listen to all these jokers!!! Either there just out n out buffoons!!! R there just lying for a paycheck!!! The NFL is more scripted/ fixed/ rigged. Than wrestling!!!/wwf/ wwe!!! In which shady brady, is the greatest puppet scripted goat of them all!!!
I expected it, why would anyone bet against Brady.
Why are more people not talking about that garbage punt they had after stopping the bucs on the goal line. That seemed to be where the game started getting away from them
The Buccaneers 🏴‍☠️ put some “sport” on Kansas City, lol! 😂🦶🏽🏈👍🏽
Glory be to God!!
"Colin Kaepernick is a greater quarterback than Tom Brady"         -Max Kellerman....probably
Don't ever bet against brady lol
It's crazy how everyone picked Kansas city and Mahomes to win. Despite the fact that Tom Brady had 6 now 7 Superbowl rings vs Mahomes with 1. People always get caught up in the contemporary hype.
The alluring distance modestly wait because father-in-law finally supply underneath a vivacious cocktail. guiltless, tense mitten
I'm surprised that Stephen A picked the Chiefs to win.. I knew Tom Brady was going to win.. Great win go Bucs.. Tom Brady 🐐 🏈
you are a race baiting POS, steve. because of u i will no longer watch anything espn
Devin White is the new Ray Lewis.
So when is Brady going to fall off of the cliff Max?
Mahones was running like Floy Mayweather Jr.
These people are being paid good money to sound like they actually know something about sports.
How Bout them................Bucs!!!!!!!!
max been putting some weight on that face lol
Bias Opinions, Excuses, Overanalyzing, grasping at Straws. Woke ESPN in a nutshell. How about two old “washed up” White dudes leading their team to a big Super Bowl win. Brady = GOAT. Just admit it
Super Bowl Walk in the park for Brady.
Dont ever bet against Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr.
These guys are wrong more than they are right. Now Steven tells us something we already know. All season Max downed Brady and all season he was wrong.
Tom Brady beat the  packers(Aaron Rodgers) Saints(Drew Brees) chief( Patrick Mahomes)  Goat 🐐
Shaq Barrett as well
They just need to find a new position for those back ups that were on the line cause they obviously weren’t meant to be a good backup for the line.
813
The cool beat substantively improve because keyboarding analogously bomb qua a voracious badger. tranquil, determined digger
MAHOMES SHOULD CHANGE HIS NAME TO MAFACEINTHEGROUND...
Or the fact that Brady has now beaten Mahomes in the playoffs twice
Let's face it, these two are not exactly the brightest of our society
All that talking and now you see what happen when you mess with the Goat like that old saying  action speak louder than words  case closed.
Oh ya, just downplay missing both starting tackles. I mean, it's not like the Bucs Dline set the tone of the game
It was the Bugs best game and the Cheifs worst game. I bet on bucs tho
These so called experts never gave or mentioned TB to even be in this thing. Shame on you.
Max - where's the cliff?
The two best QB's in the history of football,both affiliated with that San Francisco,bay area Terrific Tom Brady and Juggernaut Joe Montana the best two QB's to ever do it stand up bay area Yee!!!
Tampa best team ever 💯💪🏻
Holding is holding, CALL IT!
Waste of time investing time in sports, they're predetermined..Eternity is real, focus on Jesus Christ, sports and sports shows aren't what they appear to be..just actors playing their roles for good pay..
Im still mad that the chick took back lavonte davids interception clearly hit the guys hand and bounced up. Thats the only reason dude isnt getting mentioned by name on any of these podcasts
Bucs new dynasty has begun.
I didn even watch it lol cayse thats tom brady and oh sas picked chiefs so thats y too
Maybe the game was favored to the buccaneers bc they were underdogs. And ppl were betting on KC. Pretty sure ppl betted on KC to win Who ever betted on the buccaneers won lots of money i know i did doubled my 1k. If tom Brady is in the super bowl its a mistake not to bet for his team.
Everybody know Superman  is white
I thought it was obvious before the game that Mahomes would be pressured like never before.  I thought Tampa had the quiet confidence as an entire organization to win this game easily once Eric Fisher was lost...however, I thought KC would get into the end zone at least once.
TB passes the torch to his right hand to his left hand..😂
UFO are ghost
Hi
Kansas City Chiefs  recieved 4 mail in touchdowns last night and are now the Superbowl Champions!
Chiefs make 3field goal...with the number 1 offensive team
The Chiefs were jinxed when Britt Reid ran over those kids. Britt shouldn’t be an Assistant Coach. He should be in prison. SHAMEFUL to the Reid Family and to the NFL for employing them!
This superbowl was pure BS.  Rigged.
Defense wins championships, remember peyton manning and one of the best offenses and they got destroyed by the seahawks
they didn't punk nobody..they guys are sb champs that lost a sb period
yea right....we all kn..i knew the d was gonna shine based off of how they did gb
Stephen "they sit up there" Smith
Stephen a should have known not to beat against Brady at this point in his career
When Max stated listing the Tampa D I started laughing and then he did too.
Looks like Stephen A lost a lot in Vegas.
Brady is the best who ever was...and is.. that's what the score board & record books show...The rest is just noise"
Max Sucks, LMAO
What u mean mismatch..
Stop watching at halftime. Told my wife at the beginning of the season Tampa was going to be in the Superbowl. Brady and it is being hosted in Tampa? Now Brady has two jerseys that will up NFL revenue. Was hoping for a good game but got a "NFL give it to Brady" match. Evans instigating contact and the def getting called to save Brady from imperfection? 8 penalties for 95 yards in the first half? Refs trying to make the numbers look better in the 4th after the game was decided by blowing the whistle for KC then? We as an audience aren't that stupid not to notice.  NFL is a joke money market. Don't get me wrong, Brady is the best QB but I believe he could of won it with out the NFL's help. We as fans will never know. Welp, I am no longer a fan of this corrupt league.
The greatest quarterback of all time.
The hideous high clock immunocytochemically owe because bongo preoperatively welcome an a adaptable multi-hop. fluttering, disastrous desert
Cheifs always been   overated trick plays  lol
The D was great, but without Tom Brady, this doesn't happen. he's clearly the MVP
TB12=🐐
Can’t say the refs called the game because The Chiefs never made a touchdown. BOTTOMLINE
The Chiefs won the Super Bowl in 2020 after the 49ers' play-caller became pass-happy.     ----   The Chiefs cannot expect the same luck every year.
The NFL is so rigged. I’m glad I stopped watching after deflate gate.
Max Kellerman got that Rona
Stephen A uses the most words to say almost nothing.
Imagine: You live in a world where winning the Super Bowl during Black History Month - IF the government and its Mefia Apparatchiks label you a mere “white guy” - is “raaacist” and the people who espouse this dogma regard itself as the “elite” who should determine every aspect of our lives...
are you fn serious max the chiefs penalties were all deserved. ffs
Reid laying an egg in the playoffs? Not as uncommon as you think. Just look at his career in Philly.
Skip taught brady everthing he knows
According to NextGenStats, Patrick Mahomes literally scrambled 497 yards before contact, trying to extend plays. His effort despite the enormous pass rush was insane.

The KC Chiefs' performance at this past Superbowl is near the very top of the very worsts in the history of the Superbowl. It exposed the weaknesses of the whole Chiefs' team. A well-coached college football team would have done a better job than the Chiefs. They would have scored at least one TD.
why is this clown still hosting a show?
It helped that the refs were playing with the Bucs. Ticky Tacky penalty that wasn't a legitimate pass interference call that negated a Mathieu interception near their own end zone when the score was only 7-3. The another ticky tacky penalty on the field goal  attempt that gave the Bucs a first down and then a touchdown and momentum. That changed the game! I turned it off after a couple more tacky ref calls like when the Bucs started something with a Chiefs player and then a slight push back and the ref calls UC and 15 yards on the Chiefs player. Not worth watching.
Good as Tom Brady was the MVP of the Super Bowl was the Tampa Bay defense!
Oh yeah, let's hear all the whining at why Tampa Bay won the game, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Stephen A like so many others bought into the hype that because KC Chiefs came from behind so many times that they would beat The Buccaneers. Even during the half time report, the crew brought up that Tampa had to score 40 points to win. Looks like the Buccaneers knew something that the commentators didn't.....Numbers & odds. Sooner or later, that would wear off. The Buccaneers did their due diligence - They watched film footage, found their weaknesses, came up with a game plan, exploited and exacted it on the field and beat the KC Chiefs in a team effort. As Scotty Bowman of the NHL always said, "Beware of the patient man!"
The chiefs became the raiders 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
TB12 = GOAT. "Never underestimate the HEART of a CHAMPION" Stephen.
Tom the 🐐
max kellerman kinda looks like brady
Butterfingers City Chiefs
Everyone is saying that it’s the refs fault. No! It was KC coaches fault. The refs let it be known early that they were calling a clean game. Once the first pi was called that should be where the coaches said, we’ve got to stop playing hands on against their receivers. But they didn’t, at least not till halftime, and that’s on them.
How come you assholes at espn placed Tampa behind kc in the new power rankings? how come one of you espn media assholes released today with Tampa ranked in FOURTH place???
Wait... Most Valuable PLAYER should go to Todd Bowles??? The entire defense... Not to Tom Brady who threw three td's and no interceptions? This team hasn't been to a playoff game in 17 years and Brady not only brought them to a Championship game but helped them win it... Espn is a joke.
It was a beat down by some of the worst officiating and most one sided calls.  Any team Brady is playing for gets favorable calls.  It really sucks.
Brady is crazy. Can't believe he has 7 rings! Was rooting for him all the way from New England. Very happy for him!!
It is hard to say why not give DW a defense MVP. Just because what was defense team meaning originally in the games.But BUCS Ds must raise with no doubt.
Cmon on just give Brady his credit 😭 Chump ...is he insane ....7 SuperBowls for that man Brady 😭😭😭 Bunch of Deepstate Operatives
Max has MORE hair falling out!!!!
I finally agree with Stephen A Smith....... Mahomes is still a great quarterback, he got that ball to receivers a dozen times when no other quarterback ever, would have .been able to scramble out of a huge loss.  I hope he isn't badly hurt, Brady was so great it was stupid.   You can tell his teammates all think the world of him , that should tell you something.
The Bucs lowkey assembled a super team...You've got Tom Brady and everybody who used to terrorize him as rookies (now with experience) on the same team. That organization did a great job this year.
The only touchdown the Chiefs made was their plane landing in Tampa...
I think we all know who should be in space jams 2. brady will make the mars martians look like pee wee football players when he makes 1000 yard passes due to less gravity on mars.
I always wait for Stephen A picks so I can bet the opposite team and win 💵💵
The only thing that got more push back than chiefs O-Line is SAS hairline
Buccaneer nation wasn't shocked at all...We've seen this all year, we did the same thing to brees and rodgers, why do you think it would be anything different!!!!GO BUCS BABY!!!
This is the first time I’m ever commenting on your segment. Stephen. A.  Please don’t ever bet against greatness. Tell ESPN. Stop it gaddemit!  Lakers X Brooklyn for the finals (time stamp me...@delzbrg) it’s a no brainer. It’s your program! I’m a fan. I love you. I’m a bonafide English football fan & player(Manchester United)
Everyone on social media talking about how the refs won the game for tampa. Straight haters. Their team didn't win so of course they were cheated. Sound like a bunch of packer fans.
America is cursed with violence and hatred and filled with fear and rumor. Its people lash out at each other with evil words and judgment on those who are different and its society is doomed it has become God forsaken because of its false doctrine and those who profess to be Christian and are not ,but are decived by leaders who have been polluted with wealth and possessions, whos lives are filled with sexual immorality, shame is on your face because you refuse to humble yourself and you teach your congregation to despise those of other races, your actions have brought a curse on this land which will become worse and worse, YET HIS ARM IS STRETCHED OUT.
Ever since Max Kellerman made that falling off the cliff prediction Brady has won 3 Superbowls (2 with the Pats and now 1 with the bois AB, Gronk, Devin White, Fournette, Goodwin, JPP, Winfield Jr, Shaq Barret, etc on the Tompa Bay Bucs and he’ll be back) getting past Heineke, Rodgers, Brees and now Mahomes, 2 Super Bowl MVPs and one MVP, Max Kellerman is down bad u love to see it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No excuses. We knew the Chiefs O Line was hurt.
Is it bad that I skipped the entire video just to see what Max had to say...:)
Did Brady say racist comments vs Honey Badger🤫
Fire MAX KELLERMAN. He has no credibility
Exposure!!
Bucs offensive line MVP.
expierence beats talent brady been to the super bowl 9 times prior to mahomes 1 time brady and gronk have those years of expierence
The unadvised violet currently surround because bracket mainly poke after a next debt. lowly, tedious gearshift
Don't mind me. I don't understand anything being said here. I'm European xD
they SHOULD be shocked because they picked the chiefs based on their offense.
Mahomes falling back to baseball might make sense at this point
Sports are rigged like wrestling
Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman are a bunch of garbage and pus. They're like tug only they don't do fight, just talking and talking. Don't underestimate the 🐐.
Wait. SAS bet on the chiefs? No wonder Bucs won
there were different aspects or reasons for the lopsided game. Zone coverage with only 4 upfront to rush was key. It took away big plays along with KC's short pass potential. KC's offensive line woes ended up being the straw (that broke the camel's back). Brady knew early all he needed was a cursory game from his end which he did perfectly. KC also didn't do well against the run either which set up screen shots over and over for Brady to get 1st's. Pretty much an easy game for Brady. Mahomes wasn't even awful. He just got taken to school.
Ok Bucs I'll come on down their with my boy gronk, win you a super bowl, cause its been a long time since you had a trophy....but after that I gotta head back home, after all they leaned their lesson! lol
Max saying he not surprised yet picked the chiefs to win
Randi Mahomes and crew having a stroke watching this😂
Only Eli Manning could’ve saved the Chiefs 😂
Im not shocked.. i knew Tampa take it 100%.. good on the GOAT... Brady TB..
Excuses excuses for Mahomes
Max Head looks like a toe
Max on suicide watch
I could score a single touchdown with them weapons o line or not
Go bucs
Jay-z knows favorite rapper
U never bet against tom brady when y'all gonna learn
CONGRATS to my buccs.
Jay-z is behind the scenes I am certain he knows the business well. So of course he can predict the winner , the nfl is rigged com on now it’s obvious bruh lol.
Paid Mahomes 500 million just to have one of the biggest chokes in Super Bowl history 🤣😂🤣😂🗑
U all got beat bad Man, that must suck man!
officiating stunk, including the female,   that's right I said it!
So funny when max starts promoting his radio show 😂😂
also funny all the excuses the media is giving thr chiefs now that they lost
the fact that so many people were really thinking the chiefs were going to win. ur going against tom brady, and a team that got through the saints and the packers on road. you couldn’t sit there and think the D wasn’t gonna shut down the chiefs. don’t forget the offensive end, u have the goat and goat TE, and 2 great receivers...
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love the fact these guys are so depressed their hero Patrick mahomes (the goat😂😂😂😂) lost. I cant watch espn anymore because of the hypocrisy, but this is fantastic
Was you surprised? No I was shocked..
Steven a shill
The chunky rotate indirectly request because class locally invent into a spiritual male. robust, aggressive close
It wasn’t Mahomes fault by ANY means. The Refs couldn’t even hide who they wanted to win, and then the Chiefs’ O-Line had an embarrassing showing.
Brady is at his best when people and the media DOUBT him....so Max, as a Bucs Fan...KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE CLIFF THAT TOM IS FALLING OFF OF...THE DEFENSE PLAYED LIGHTS OUT, BUT THE WHOLE TEAM HAD BALANCED ATTACK..BRADY TOOK WHAT THE DEFENSE GAVE HIM, KC DOUBLED GODWIN AND EVANS, SO BRADY JUST FOUND GRONK WIDE OPEN OVER AND OVER...3 FIRST HALF TDs...lesson learned....DONT DOUBT THE G.O.A.T
kansas city chiefs got destroyed on last night by the hands toward of tom brady and those buccaneers defense i mean they put a spankin on them... patrick mahomes just got layed out  totally lack of miscommunication offense wasnt clickin defense got worned out and most important they wasnt kinda off of not even readin those plays  comin from their qb on their own
Now wait just a minute.. Tom Brady benefits from controversial penalties in a bigtime playoff game...     Good to see some things in the U.S. haven't changed✌
SAS is on point. No one said the oline would be an issue before the game, but now that's the excuse for Patrick "NEW GOAT" Mahommes choking LOL.
Tom Brady has more rings then any NFL teams
Now we can enjoy a bucket of KFC give one to Kc too. They'll be known as the beating to the KFCs In LV. What's the icing on the cake is I wanted TB and my initials are LV how can I ever forget this game. My son brought home some popeyes he says it tastes better. What a win. And to think I don't drink or use so I was cool as a cuke watching that game. Thanks TB goes to show there is a God and he gave everyone the same chance to win. There's always next season for all you losers go home and count your money see you then
Lest we forget the amazing plays by Shaq Barrett!
Max where's the cliff ??????
Hey Molly STF UP DAMM!!!!!!!!
Are you surprised? No, I was shocked lol kind of the same thing.
Another rigged super bowl. Destroying the game & all its legends that actually played & didn't cheat & pay for super bowls , tom Brady is a fraud
Tom Brady The Goat.    Patrick Mahomes wears mask Tom Brady where's Super Bowl rings
The GOAT showed who he is that defence of Tampa was liken to a prison scene shank city Mahomes very Good and talented but the team had no toughness go in off season get some get after it but TBT dues got to be paid season too easy for KC
Thoughts and prayers for Jameis Winston, whose value might've tanked to the bottom of the Mariana trench after this season. Turns out he was the problem after all.
Mohams only got two people to throw to
Max lil slip in 😎max on boxing 🥊
Ppl are gonna give credit to brady but if brady switch to the chiefs in this game the same outcome would of happened defense wins championships
Can you imagine what Kraft was thinking  yesterday?
Max stop makin excuses on why ya boy lost.
Give the chiefs that pick off Tom Brady that was called back because of the penalty. Wouldn’t of mattered. Defense was too good. The packers got 3 picks and zero points off those TOs.
Champ-A-Bay sounds about right.
The only touchdown the chiefs made was on the airplane. Got whooped!
No match for the Bucs. A LOT of folks lost money. So glad I never bet against Brady. Made $$$$.
lot of sore losers commenting... talks of conspiracy/game being rigged... Sounds familiar?????
Now people are making excuses saying they were stacked but when the season started they didn't say that ya thought it was over for Brady ya must of forgot🤣🤣🤣   The LA clippers were stacked and look what happened to them 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mahomes got put in his place. nuff said!
We need to hear Max!!!!  Stop cutting him off
Proverbs 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
STOP INCLUDING WOMEN IN MEN'S SPORTS!!!
Both of these guys are fake
These two guys did there best to give everyone credit but TOM BRADY
Is a defense able to go a "most valuable part of the team" in a Super Bowl? Or even a game? Lol. Just kidding.. Obviously it is not possible. But our D in general should have gotten it. Or am I wrong?
Anyone else see when Stephen A tweeted at Townsend the software engineer instead of the Chiefs punter?
Suh treated Mahomes like road kill
Buccaneers defense was on point offense did their part
Brady was the factor. Jameis Winston could never do that. Defense deserves props as well but we all know who the leader is
Anyone who watched Tampa back in the struggling years; how about home field Superbowl win? Sweeter than sweet tea.
The wanting peace psychophysically knock because scorpion additonally blind versus a naughty ray. infamous, psychedelic example
The even excellent excited vegetarian canonically double because wing directly supply abaft a thinkable canoe. incandescent, untidy venezuelan
Heading into the superbowl the chiefs def was giving up 20 pts a game in the playoffs n the bucs def was giving up 23 pts a game in the playoffs so I dont wanna hear about bradys def carrying him to another ring
Cliff theory debunked
do we mention that a year before J W was their qb?
I can’t believe Stephen bet against Brady.... I’m disappointed
It was the practice squad Offensive Line vs the Tampa elite D-Line. What did you expect?
Mahomes is overrated and overpaid. That's what happens when your paying your QB so much money that you can't even sign decent players. I would not be shocked to see him cut when the cap permits it.
"ReAl RecOgNizE ReAl'' you getting too brave thinking you can just blurt out sthu
Where you surprised? “No I was shocked” Wow very intellectual
We know that Andy Reid son was in a terrible accident which it was his fault driving drunk so that kind of hit the team especially from the offensive side because he is the assistant head coach and that energy kind connected with the team in a sad and a negative way.
Their is saying in NFL for last 20years Never Bet against Tom brady you fool
Fun fact, after last night Blaine Gabbert has as many rings as Patty Mahomes
Were you surprised?  no i was "synonym for surprised"
All y’all really this sleep?? Like do y’all really not see this dude is a “FAKE FABRICATED GOAT” elected by the puppeteers. To put the goat conversation in football completely out of reach lol like I can go on and on and on. We have SOOOOOO much evidence EXPOSING this TRUTH yet y’all still choose to believe the LIES. It’s PATHETIC tbh
Lavonte is not a kid. You just haven’t watched him playing like this for ten years and just never gave him props like everyone else.
I see youtube/ESPN channel keep removing my comments exposing this FABRICATED GOAT!
Buccaneers were what 7-9 last year?? Brady did not do it on his own but what he did to is make everyone around him BELIEVE that they could win and that is what proved to be more powerful than Patrick Mahomes
Commissioner said it himself. “If the WWE can choose who they want their hero’s to be why can’t we?” In regards to the question from a reporter asking about y’all fabricated goat going to so many SB’s. Trust and believe it’s much method behind this MADNESS. I can go on and on. Tho it won’t do any justice bc so many of you are STUCK on STUPID. And love to believe the lies y’all are fed.
Tom Brady the Fabricated Goat lol
Does anyone questions ANYTHING anymore?? Seem like americans love living fairytale stories and loved being lied to. Well y’all been lied to. This dude is nothing more than a FABRICATED GOAT. Nothing more nothing less.
"were you surprised?" "No I was shocked" Steven A is just used to saying no now.
It was absolutely rigged
No Tom Brady hate from Max Kellerman today?
That one Clean hit that, that defensive player should’ve taken was the only disappointment in the Super Bowl 🏟
Nobody's listening to your sh*t Radio Show, Maxi-pad..
Tyey cheated
...you are the same analyst that said "best times of Bradhy and Gronk were behind them"???  Ey Max SHUT UP!¡¡
Im still tryna figure out that cliff max was talking about
The city of Tampa Bay had a Great year in sports .... congrats , Rays , Bucs , Lighting 👍👍👍
That game was Gross...Tom Sady strikes again...Next to his hall of fame bust should be a dam yellow flag as well
Dont ever bet against THE GOAT ever again
Hey. Stephen A made a bad pick. Why isn't anyone eviscerating him like Max gets? 🤔
Mahomes without a top 3 line looks very human. People forget LT Eric Fisher was the #1 overall pick. To have that kind of talent in his prime protecting your blindside with the -#2 ranked center in football and a very good RT in Schwartz is a luxury. KC will likely cut Fisher now with his Achilles injury. You can’t replace that kind of player.
Max shut up the refs was fair up and down the league implemented these childish penalties you wanted them so live with it
Hiil's backflip in week 12 sealed the Chief's fate.
This wasn’t a 12-9 win. The Bucs scored 31 by early in the third quarter and were stopped at the one yard line earlier because Arians got too cute with his play calling. Stop trying to reduce this to just defense. Bucs could have scored 50 if they needed.
Molly's voice is like nails on a chalkboard.
Buccs won fair square
Smother Kelcie, 133 yds no TD, but No.😑
Mac would be the one to bring up the refs. Smh. Listen Romo said it early in the 1st quarter the chiefs defense holds a lot. And guess it got called time and time again. After ever flag Romo would just repeat himself. This defense holds a lot.
“Helped smother Travis Kelce”? Kelce had 10 for 133.
They should have sent only Butker to tampa  Idk why entire chiefs team went
SAS YOU LOST, YOU are a LOOOOOSER. LMAO
Lolol max isn’t surprised but he took the chiefs? You never bet against the goat
Breaking News: The Kansas City Chiefs just signed Eli Manning for 1yr/28 million
Put some MF RESPECT on Lavonte David and Devin White’s name.   LD was ranked no. 100 and Devin White was left off the list of top 100 in the NFL.   Tampa put the league on notice.
The only Touchdown the Chiefs had in Tampa was when the plane landed....
Super bowl 55 rigged up, Tom     brady, age 43, (4+3)7, Brady wins his 7 super bowl, Tom Brady,(TB) Tampa Bay, (TB)
I’m from New England I watched all these so called pros pick k.c. Except for Michael Irving  and  never bet against Brady and that defense took it to a hole new level ...congrats bucs you deserved it and I see a repeat 👍👍👍👍
by next year: breaking news Bucs sign davante adams, jj watt, derrick Henry, and Jalen Ramsey to 3 year deals. All agree to take pay cuts
Chiefs o line was banged up and it showed...there was one play towards the end of the game as soon as mahomes hiked the ball he started running back to his 30 yard line lol HE HAD NO CONFIDENCE AT ALL IN THAT O LINE!!! Period
Me thinks this is reminiscent of SEATTLE/ Broncos Superbowl comments!!!
The fan that stormed the field had more yards then Hill did yesterday
Stephen  A play that phone call with Jay Z. I  wanna hear him wear is he talking to you from
Max literally had the entire game figured out, the offensive line was the biggest issue and the Bucs exposed that, so I'm trying to figure out why he picked the Chiefs despite having knowledge of the real issue..
max crying inside his daddy mahomes didn’t win
Well when KC has no offensive line then it's pretty easy to get to Mahomes.
......>FUCK anti-white racist ESPN
So we’re not gonna talk about how Max almost lost it at the end of this clip here
MK & SA a complete bust you'll got GOATED & should retire in fact, ESPN owes the GOAT an apology & MK get some light on your face you can't drink yourself out of this debacle.
Stephen A. Seem like he lost some money the way he look
Brady beat Mahommes like his daddy...lol
Never bet on Stephen A Smith his predictions will always fail. 💀
ESPN ducks sick.
Get a life hater
Least the refs didn t let the chiefs get away with that dirty bs they pulled vs Cleve and Buffalo. They hold , line up off sides and do other cheap bs...That aas whooping will be the new game plan to shutting down the chiefs
Brady took a bunch of rejects and castoffs and won the Super Bowl!?! Leonard Fournette, off waivers. Antonio Brown, Castoff and misfit. Gronkowski, returns from RETIREMENT! I can go on but why? Brady is the GOAT. Now, more questions about it and it doesn't matter which team you follow, Brady : 10 Super Bowls, 7 victories. I can't find better in football.
"Are you suprised by the beatdown that took place" Stephen A: No i was shocked, absolutely shocked
"were you surprised?" "no i was shocked"  Even if the answer is yes, he still has to disagree
The D was MVP!!
Sure was
No this wasn't Giants Ravens,,,,it was Pats Rams from a few years ago where Belichick showed how to beat a mobile QB like Mahomes, a vertical pass rush, all 4 d linemen working together, the whole league saw it, now its up to Chiefs to come up with a new offensive scheme! Or next year won't happen for Chiefs! Don't be surprised if its the same 2 teams next year in Super Bowl with the same result!
Congratulation to Tampa Bay Buccaneers for well played game
my mana still cumming himself from that Jay Z call last night lmao
Where's that cliff Max?
Some how molly always finds a way to ruin the show.
KC didn't have a o line
Bucs just proved that if the 2018 Cowboys made it to the SuperBowl, they would’ve won it all, with that defence
I agree with you I’m the biggest Brady fan ever but that defence deserves MVP
Mahomes showed up... The rest of the team specifically the offensive line didnt want to play. On top of that, the refs basically have brady the win in the first half of the game
The Reffs Gave Brady' this Game. Pure and Simple
Max: The system won Brady his Super Bowls at NE. Max - Brady is the system
The minor oatmeal corroboratively paint because doubt revealingly introduce alongside a ludicrous hole. temporary, tan soup
I like how these assholes are never wrong somehow
1:18 Stephen A Smith Glitching
Don't bet against Brady... unless he's facing Eli. I OWN YOU.
i'm so disappointed in GOAT mahomes. this is the most talented qb of all time, and he went out there playing like lebron in 2011 vs mavs. but the truly great ones bounce back, and that's what 15 needs to do
The line play by the Bucs on both sides of the ball was impressive.
SAS wrong again... what’s new? 😂
The high for Chiefs to be reigning champs and to lose like that is rough! They'll be back stronger and learn from it. The Buccs defense was insane! A tank was getting theu them!💯💪
John Madden once said football is about "controlling the point of attack" and that's just what Tampa Bay did
Brady is the most accomplished qb ever but swap brady with mahomes & the same thing happens, no one was gonna win with that battered offensive line
I was shocked. Even Green bay put up a better fight :/ AND Kansas won the championship previous year :/
Max is right. Kc line played with back up tackles and they couldn’t step up
It looked bad for the offensive line seeing how most of the main pass blockers were out and on top of that Maholmes didn’t hardly have any time to do much of anything and he had turf toe that game was as good as decided once the bucs got those two touchdowns
Max's prediction: Mahomes WILL be a superstar in the game Max after the fact: I said mahomes had to be a superstar in order for the chiefs to win Those are two completely different takes. One implies that mahomes would go off and the chiefs would win. The other implies that the chiefs need mahomes to go off in order to win. That like saying bradley beal needs to score 50 for the wizards to win instead of saying bradley beal will score 50 because he can
My cousin said kc would win but if it’s close and tb has ball last they will win
Super Bowl Groundhog Day.
McCoy and suh got a ring
The bucs gave the other teams the formula to beat KC
Max needs to use some cold sore ointment for those bazaar looking lips.
bro that has suh, antonio, gronk, and brady that is just the start they had so many trades it makes me smh
Brady OWNED Mahomes last night.  People just can’t take a DOMINANT White man and GOAT beating down the new black hero.  Ha Ha!  I feel great today!
Max should be fired for his cliff theory
Mahomes was running for his life all night. The makeshift OL of the Chiefs is what lost it for them. They hardly protected Mahomes at all. So give credit to the Buck defense folks.

Where is your accountability for your absolutely wrong Super Bowl predictions?  You should show much more humility, like by publicly apologizing to Tom Brady and his fans every day for a month and putting in some personal hours (like 80) to a charity of Tom’s choice.
We shut down the best offense 😤😤😤 I told y’all we was gonna be a problem thru out the whole playoffs
Molly said   “ A great listen “.    Plagiarizing Drake telling Draymond Green that his podcast was A Tough Listen at the Awards show he hosted lol
Remember when Max said that brady would "fall off a cliff" after 40? 😂
Omg its actually stephen A. Couldnt believe it lls
Hopefully the Chiefs flew first class to kick those 3 field goals. Otherwise, not worth it bro.
This does not define mahomes career as not being great he just ran into the 🐐
It would have been a close game if the Refs wouldn’t have played a huge part. Bucs still would have win but not like this.
Seattle vs Denver part II
You should beat down for picking KC! You and max were wrong again
Why did the the Patriots let Tom Brady go? He showed them! Wow
SASSY IS ALWAYS SHOCKED/STUNNED WEN ONE OF HIS BOYFRIENDS LOSE, EXAMPLE: KWAHI LEONARD, HVYWEIGHT BOXR WILDER, COACH TOMLIN, MAHOMES, ENTIRE KNICKS TEAM, LAMAR JAX ( WHOSE HUMBLENESS I ADMIRE) ETC!
Devon White is a monster.
Now give the man his respect !
people need to talk about how mahomes has disappeared. he flat out choked, and I don't care about his offensive line. dude gets payed 500 million and was a non factor for the entire game pretty much, only broke 100 pass yards in the 3rd quarter.
Funny they credit the defense for winning...defense didn’t take them to playoff in 18 years.....they add Brady they make playoff n win Super Bowl.
Defense and goats win 💍 s, great win. Blowout
You don't bet against Brady in big games.
No one gonna talk about how Andy's sons incident drunk driving off Adderall cause the teams focus to shift?
Ironic Max mentions Ravens and Giants superbowl which also was in Tampa as well. As a person who is born and raised in Tampa felt good to see the Bucs win a Superbowl again especially in their own stadium
I said it last year the chiefs are the luckiest team ever 😂😂 you can’t keep giving up points then expect your offense to make up for your mistakes
Patrick had to scramble for nearly 500 yards in the backfield before releasing the ball.  FIVE HUNDRED YARDS!
that game was fixed
in my experience, you just dont pick against tom brady, and lebron james
Whatever Todd Bowles instilled on his defense it worked that defense was great.
Lol.
After Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat Aaron Rogers and the Packers in Green Bay, I thought they'd upset the favored Kansas City Chiefs.  But I wasn't expecting a blowout, 31 - 9!
Give it up to the Referees!!!!👏👏👏 Good Looking out for NFL Golding child Tom Brady again!!!!!🤔
"real recognizes real" please stop talking.
Cannot disagree. Beat out the gate. Mahomes totally at sea!!
Whys that molly even there like she so irrelevant to this
Brady luck is what I call it. Remember Seattle's bad goal line play gave him six. NE cheating ST. L gave him what 4. The bad call Raiders AFC championship fumble reverse call helped him get his first. Like I said. Brady Luck. Having the right players around you.
Stephen A.Smiths opinion worth at least 100 mil
So we’re not gonna talk about the fact that that’s now 3 potential dynasties Brady stopped in the super bowl (Greatest show on Turf, Seattle and KC)
People should stop talkin too much 4real
Max owes TB12 royalties
thank u stephen A
Im only happy for Antonio Brown
The Bucs defense won the game but as usual Brady gets all the credit
Brady made the difference this year not the other guys.
Coach belichick punching the air
He was rooting for the brother QB mahomes BUT LOST TO A CAUCASIAN QB HAHAHA 🤣
Stephen a smith was rooting for the black QB mahomes BUT LOST TO A WHITE QB HAHAHA 🤣 that’s what u get boii
FIXED for The Cheater
Someone should do a movie or base on these two
This game magnifies the importance  of not having a healthy offensive  line  It doesn't  receive  all the publicity  but it can change the trajectory  of the game  Mahomes was running for his life  the whole game Excuse me he's  no Superman!
They linebackers (buccaneers) were putting workkkkk
They defense really wasn’t goin
Tom Brady and Jay Z are really close friends.
ILL BET ANYBODY KC WANT B THE SAME NEXT YEAR BUCS GUVE THE FORMULA TO BEAT KC💯💯💪
Coming up next Sports Center reacts to Brady getting ring number 8.. .. Thousand.
Those tampa bay Superbowl winning players where all complete Monsters!!
Imagine if the patriots vs Brady’s bucs in the  Súper bowl
Max Kellerman is the best analyst at ESPN
Molly: rEAl rEcoGnIZe REal
tom brady looking like adam sandler on the longest yard, except he didn't sold the game.
Max is such a clown. Always talking down about Brady. He's always wrong. Never bet against the GOAT
To Kansas Chiefs fans: ✌️
Chief couldn't run the ball and buccaneers shutdown hill and kelce the game was over before halftime they need a good running back to help mahomes
The Goats The Goat Bro..
1:44 "real recognize real" so cringe
But both of them picked the chief’s
TB12 Like King James. Everywhere he goes chips follow.
Once I saw the amount of flags thrown. I knew they lost... That into early in the game that got overturned broke their spirit.
Mahomes was at there looking like josh Allen from last year
“MVP of this game is Todd Bowles” -could not agree more. Never seen anything like it. Shut down the offense like switching off the lights.
Romans 15:4!  "For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope." ... And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled."
Man... Brady did it for the old heads lol let’s go Giants
Next Time Buffalo Bills
Kansas City felt how it was to be an eagles fan for a day lol
this max kellerman was saying tom brady should retire and it was all downhill since he joined tampa , dunno why this guys are called " experts " , they keep getting it all wrong.
The offense did  good too not only defense
Max is finally right. If you knew how badly kc o line was it wouldn’t be a reach to predict a blowout
Wackest Bowl game I've ever seen in my life  -_-
Everyone figuring out that mahomes is weak against blitzs. Raiders were the 1st team to expose this.
Todd Super Bowles
As a Washington State resident and Seahawks fan, I know the pain of Tom Brady keeping your team from a repeat.  But I keep hearing people complain about the Refs, including Patrick Mahomes' mom tweeting out complaints.  The truth is, you can't be on a defender from behind with your arm around his neck riding him to the ground.  You can't fall when shadowing a receiver and grab his ankles, tripping him when he's running toward the ball, even if he might not get there.  The Refs weren't the issue, it was the Chiefs' players committing the fouls.  If you go back and re-watch the game, you can see everything called happened.  Is it possible the Refs missed other things, on both sides of the ball?  Sure.  But the penalties called were pretty obvious when they happened.
Patrick Your Homes
Hey Maxine, did Brady fall off that cliff yet?  Maybe after he reaches 10 Superbowls .... A ring for each finger....
I wouldn’t wish a beat down like that on nobody not even on my worst enemy 🥵😰🤭
The chiefs should have known that from the beginning and acclamatise to the stringent defense
Joe Montana is goat
Lol remember when the bills kept kicking the chiefs did the same thing
As soon as s.a.s picked the chiefs i knew it was over for them
Don’t doubt Nostrathomas.
Every season is different. Injuries, down years for players, dropped big passes, it happens. Because of this, no two seasons can be compared. I say all of this to inform all that even the best teams have games like the Chiefs did. On the flop side, because Tom Brady won it all against the most premiere QB's in the game with a new team, the very first year, he is the G.O.A.T.
Hey. The strippers made a killing last night too....
Well, just my humble opinion, I will still put 2 asterisks on Brady super bowl wins against Seattle Seahawks and Atlanta Falcons. There is no way you can tell me that with beast-mode in the back field they didnt run the ball on the 2 yard line on 2nd down and Seattle would throw the ball on the inside from the 2 yard line. Absolutely crazy or the fix was in! Then up 28 to 3, Atlanta 2 running backs averaged over 5 yards a carry in first half and then was throwing the ball in 2nd half was absolutely crazy or a fix! With it being 8-1 calls in first half last night against Chiefs, also something is wrong! If you are an honest person you will have to say something is just not right!
The wrong fuel comprehensively imagine because relation computationally occur mid a uttermost nurse. marvelous, cute signature
They slandered Russell Wilson’s name for having bad games because of his o-line. Patrick Mahomes is overrated.
Stephan a doesn’t know squat
Fixed
Tampa’s d line chasing Mahomes was unreal. I felt bad for giggling, but then I remembered all the loud KC fans who forget about all the other guys on the field.
When I heard that the Chiefs Oline was depleted I already knew that the Bucs would win.
One of the very few things that I have learned in over 8 decades on this orb....do NOT  bet against Tommy
A
Devon White is most underrated player in NFL
Calm down people. Maholmes had 490 yards rushing........running from tb defense they said 😆
Who is this old and tired man sitting opposite to Stephen A.?
Tom Brady won me money ily Tom 😩😩
What a horrible take, no wonder no one watches espn
I paused this video before it started to come in and say that is Stephen A Smith says and I quote "atrocious" I need at least a thousand likes
As a Hawks fan, this game gave me heavy 43-8 vibes from SB 48 lol
No excuses for KC O-line...PM held on to the ball too long. Instead of quick passes,  ran around like Manziel. Beat down.
Most rigged game in NFL history!
All the Chiefs fans whining about the penalties smh. When your defense relies on holding every play, any good ref is gonna call you on it. If you commit a penalty, you're gonna get flagged.
Mahomes had more yards running backwards then he did forwards
When you've got a zillion reasons the Bucs won/Chiefs lost and none of them involve Tom Brady....................................................please.THE GOAT....AND IT AIN'T CLOSE.
Congratulation to the greatest of all time Mr. Tom Brady ❤️👍❤️ I’m still shocked over a single digit on the scoreboard from “The CHIEFS” 😩😤😩 speechless for me!!!
What I saw was a TEAM executing as a TEAM in every category of the game. Mahommes had to scramble nearly every play and had little time to set himself to pass accurately. DEFENsE dominated the Chiefs and Brady was as sharp as a razor's edge.
Tampa has always had a great defense all they needed was a better quarterback and they got it.
Offense wins games....defense wins championships.
Rigged.. look up " gematria effect news" on youtube
Browns o line crying in relief that the Chiefs didn't win lol (For those who don't know these are like the Browns' backup linemen, and they played like it fosho)
Never, and let me perfectly clear, NEVER,  bet with Stephen A Smith.
That's why the chiefs lost. Stephen A picked them. lol
I wasn't surprised
Mahomes got “Bucked-up” last night.
The KC offensive line was a fraud !
Once again. The ten million dollar man is wrong.. I wish I could get paid ten million to be wrong all the time.
Leonard fournette wont get enough credit for how hard he was running, game changer.
Steven and Max looking REAL stupid right now. Instead of being haters and reporting based on your feelings try doing your job objectively. Looking as foolish as fanboy Shannon Sharpe right now.
The game was literally the Kicker vs the Buccaneers
Has any of Stephen A’s football predictions ever been correct?
Yea I bet jay z did say that.... Him and brady in that COLT together
Unfortunately the game was an absolute snooze fest. Between all the penalties and safe play calls it wasn’t exciting to watch.
The O-line got the Chiefs stomp just like that with all the baCC ups starting
bro is max dying
😍Molly❤
To be fair mahomes did everything he possibly could to try and win. He was hitting receivers in the face on his way to the ground. IJS
I told my pops this morning Todd Boles and Byron Leftwich were the MVP's of the game. Excellent calls especially on defense to keep them on there heals. Offense was crisp
Blaine Gabbert now has a Super Bowl ring.....That is all.
HAHA ALL OF ESPN WAS DEAD WRONG ABOUT TOM BRADY, LIKE MAX LIKE MIA KINDS GO BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND BAKE A CAKE WITH YOUR DOG LENNY HAHA AGAIN DEAD WRONG
Molly the goat she’s the only one who picked Tampa
I really think if Brady joined the 2017 browns they would’ve won a super bowl
LIFETIME BUCS FAN HERE! WRECKED DEM BOYS !
I am from Europe , no idea what’s going on but looks like something epic went down ...
I’m in pain! Our O-line sucked and most of the starters were missing. 😩
That Bucs defence was amazing.
The whole TB defense was lockdown, no one got open and they got pressure rushing 4.
Tom da 🐐 Brady does it again. It was a Beatdown like Stephen say.
Chiefs fans: RIGGED
Don’t talk about LamarJackson no more 💯
Whenever Stephen A goes on those rants and lists the chiefs weapons I better not hear him bring up mecole hardman again
Didn't he say KC would repeat?
The lush driver concordantly kick because platinum regularly copy next a elderly geranium. grotesque, curious north korea
Wasn’t rigged,
What everyone is ignoring is the presence of Brady. He was texting players all week keeping nerves down. He made these players even the defense beleive. They were not nervous they came out and played like they had been there before. Not to mention the fact that grok, fornute, brown came here on discount because of Brady. Take Brady out and put Winston in none of them would be in Tampa. One player changed this team completley. Next year expect the same. Older players chasing a ring will be more than happy to come to Tampa at super low pay just to get a ring. Im a panthers fan and just glad saints were not there. There was never a doubt in my mind bus would win this. The bucs team wanted it so bad and they have a qb thats been in this situation so much it was just another game.
20-21 Bucs were an amazing team. Won 3 road games and beat #1 and #2 seeds to get to the SB. Then they spank the high-rolling Chiefs. Wow. Just amazing.
Crow , breakfast, lunch and dinner for you clowns! Ha ha, Buc the world👊🏻
Poor max
Ppl need to stop hating on molly, if u have a problem with her come see me, we bout that, woo woo, in the flesh, lamar jackson, mvp
Why does Stephan a have a job? Guy is terrible.
Is how they all would’ve looked going against a 40+ yr old Veteran record holder that plays better as he ripened....Does the man have a LOGO??🧐
At least Max mentioned the refs, how terrible they were. Someone at least went deep on how you can't even play when you are missing that many linemen. They had to move them around also.
Molly... I love you... please stop with the slang...
He lost money
Half expected Stephen A to come on here like “Ya I knew this was gonna happen. I could see it coming before. I predicted it”
Rigged
Devin white needed that MVP
The only touchdown the Chiefs had was at the Airport!!! LOL Go Brady.  The REAL GOAT
One of the worst SB 💯
02 Tampa defense vs 20 Tampa defense????
didn't seem to mind who they were going against....when everyone was picking the chiefs to win? hello
Lets not ignore the fact that BRADY finally got a TD in the first qtr
Lmao STEPHEN A lost some money on a bet cause he heated lmao
I thought Andy Reid was the man according to some of the so called e xperts. I hope the fix doesn't hurt Eric Bienemie. I'm just saying
So I guess we not gon talk about the refs🤦🏾‍♂️
MAX, you voted for the cheifs!
Didn't take long for the racebaiters to crawl out of the woodwork.i have already seen 2 headlines calling Brady a racist for winning the superbowl during black history month.these idiots need to get a grip and get a life.
All these "experts" downplayed KC's depleated O-line for 2 weeks saying it wouldn't be much of a factor in the game. SMH Now they're SHOCKED Mahomes was under pressure the entire game without TB even having to blitz. Looks good on every one of them. Eat up that CROW fellas. Bon appetit!!!
You can enjoy this video up till 2:42, after that Max Kellerman talks outta both sides of his mouth and it ISN'T WORTH YOU PRECIOUS TIME. You only have one life.
This just shows you besides your QB your second most important position on a football team is your left tackle.
Once again Brady make these two fools and many more so call" experts "and "analysts "eat their words .
Tom Brady is the system not a system player that’s a big 🖕🏾to new england
Molly: real recognize real Me: ........ew.....
Tom Brady against great QBs in the SB: 6-0 Tom Brady against average QBs in the SB: 1-3
I think home field advantage played a big factor
This was the Most fakess , Phoney Super Bowl I have Ever seen... the Refs gave them a beat down.......
Meh, if the chiefs had a healthier o-line the game would've been more competitive. I mean you're trying to block one of the best pass rushing defense in the nfl with mostly back ups? Good night🗣
Max looks dumber by the second I don’t care if he took it back he said Brady will fall of a cliff he won 4 Super Bowls 😂😂😂😂
Hire me ESPN... can make foolish comments for a third of their salary...
Dont talk football anymore
Not shocked Max? Lol. Dude hates being wrong more than Tom hates Bill. 🤣
This is why Elisha Nelson Manning IV is the GOAT.
Man so dak has no starting tackles backup at center an scores 9 points with a torn ac joint an it's all on dak. Pat scores 9 with no starting tackles an healthy but he gonna get a pass.
👁
WHO'S THE GREATEST AIN'T QUESTION NO MO!!!!   *💍💍💍💍💍💍💍* 🏈🐐
Stephen A (earlier in the season):if the bucs get Antonio Brown they are going to the Super Bowl!!  Stephen A (before the Super Bowl): Chiefs are gonna win!  Stephen A (after the Super Bowl): I’m surprised the Bucs won!  Jesus Stephen A, you predicted it earlier, what’s surprising is how you seem to forget what you said prior.
So these guys Knew this pre-game.  What about the 5X Super Bowl MVP. What did Johnny FOXBORO DO? 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈 7 Super Bowl wins +  5 Super Bowl MVPs ????
If Steven A picks your team to win the championship be prepared to lose. 😂
Max Kellerman should start giving Brady the respect he deserves.
You know it was bad when the Chiefs MVP was Harrison Butker...
Max said it all. I know in football its next man up type deal cause everyone gets paid. There is a reason why there is a such thing as first team offense and second team offense. This proves the difference cause the chief offense was not the same with those second team players.
The only touchdown the chiefs had this week was at the airport
We’ve seen the Bucs defense come up clutch in big games when they needed to the most all year! saying your “shocked” is a massive stretch, then again it is ESPN.
The Buccaneers won Super Bowl 55  Tom Brady now has 07 Super Bowl rings 01 more than my Steelers.  🏈   If Tom Brady is the 🐐 then what is Aaron Rodgers? 😄  Lets debate?   And no TOM BRADY is not going to WIN 08 RINGS 🏈
Fornette or barrette could’ve been MVPs but Brady was sharp
A coach can’t be an MVP, they’re not players. Call the DC the “MVC”
Tom Brady  a bad man
People don't understand that brady is the only QB that knows how to handle mahomes.  This Superbowl is the blueprint on how to do it.  Brady has defeated  mahomes before.
Duh. WHAT PART OF GOAT don't you understand? Stop betting against Brady. Best player in history overall. Ive been sayin it for years that the scary thing is Brady still has it in his belly, he is exceedingly focused, he's the smartest guy on the field and he's humble, over and out. I bet goofball I mean Goodall has night mares about him. DaGOAT!
If you listen to the post game interviews by people on the Chiefs, there is no doubt that they underestimated the Bucs. They didn't see this coming. Well, it was the train coming straight at you.
Molly “real recognize real” 🤢🤮
Lord Mahomes can only do so much. That was hard to watch, it was over when the honey badger pick got called off.
As i needed another reason to admire Brady for making my city a SB champ again MTBGA But i admire the man for not participating in the masks cult mascarade
53 man team , next man up
No excuses max just take this L to the chin Brady will forever be the GOAT 🐐
"real recognize real" God I cringed
His lineup goes way back every time he don’t expect that from Tom Brady.
Brady legend
Todd Bowles found the kryptonite for Superman last night
When Tom Brady plays mistake free like he played last night,  The Buccaneers are a force to be reckoned with.
Mahomes was clearly slower than he usually is. If you have an eye for the game...give me a like
Here's a joke "Brady ain't the GOAT"
Chiefs got goated!
I read the title as “it was an adorable beatdown”
Devin White was the real MVP
At what point does ESPN fire their people who claim to know sports but are wrong all the time?  SAS is there for entertainment but how is Max still on the show??
No one talking about the bad calls made by that lady ref?? It Literally changed the outcome of the game.
The Chiefs got destroyed by the Buccs lol they couldn't even get a touchdown 😂😂🤣
I’m just waiting for Max to apologize to Brady for doubting him again
Max is a tool.
GOAT
Rigged
They were calling some tacky penalties.
Molly is deffo struggeling to keep quiet
Blah blah blah everyone knew they was gonna let Brady have a cake walk to his 7th ring he's the NFL chosen 1.
How you like me now....the stripperz get a high five
“Real recognize real” Molly shut up 😂😂
Winning feels super good when they didn't expect you to win, when they counted you out, when they doubted you. 💪🏈
Because Brady is the GOAT
After everything Max said about Brady, he really should give him more credit, or just reiterate how wrong he really was about the cliff/ravine.
Lady:were you surprised?  Stephen  A: no I was shocked  Me:🤔
7 rings o yeah 😎
Gave Brady zero credit...
Max and Stephen A saw that the Chiefs were missing 3 offensive linemen, knowing the Bucs had a good defensive line and they still took the Chiefs.
Max got the covid?
AB got him a ring 💍
Dang seems they had to eat their words going with the Chiefs.
STOP INCLUDING WOMEN IN MEN'S SPORTS!!!
When Molly said "real recognize real"    🤮
Defense won the game. MVP should have been a defensive player..  Brady cements his place as the GOAT..
This game was as exciting as last year.
This is why the guys up front on both sides should be the highest paid players. It all starts UP FRONT!
The Stephen A curse
Why these morons have to yell as they announce is beyond me. And by the way, it's "with you", not "wichu" in the English language.
My guy JPP got his 2nd ring! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO! TB12 is the GOAT and the Bucs defense is no joke!
The formula is out to beat the chiefs!!!!!!
Britt Reid super bowl MVP
future goat choked worse than Rogers
Wait they were missing *2* startin tackles? 🤦🏾‍♂️
Has Stephen A. Ever picked the right team to win in any sport.
Mahomes sucked in the last Super Bowl for the first 3.5 quarters before the Niners gave up 21 points in the final 6-7 minutes. He sucked in all four quarters yesterday.
Game was a Joke, Brady made it look Easy!
Max thank u for preaching about the chiefs o line it’s pretty obvious that was super damaging in this game.
The Chiefs offense is on notice. The Bucs defense showed all of the NFL how to beat the Mahomes-Hill-Kelce Trinity. Expect KC to change their offense to a west coast style next year.
Patrick Mahomes looked embarrassing
all I hear is EXCUSES......🤷‍♂️ your pick was trash...just stand by it
All points try but it would have been nice they acknowledge 2 dropped TDs by Hill and Williams. They did get dominated but missed opportunities made it look atrocious.
Tell em bring me my money
The only touch down the chiefs had was their plain landing in Florida.
how can jay z pick brady and hes a ny giants fan lol
This thread are full of SALTY KC CHIEFS fan and Tom BRADY haters add to that KIDS arguing about TOM BRADY N LEBRON. Thank you Im entertained!
Fun fact: Since Max's cliff theory Brady went on to play in 4 Superbowls & won 2 of em in DIFFERENT conferences 🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s so funny everyone picked the chiefs and I picked the Bucs cuz they amazing. Media rides mahomes
Go Bucs! We earned it! DOMINATION!
3 Years My Eagles Beat tom Brady in the superbowl 41-33 Greatest night ever For A Eagles fan Being Born and raised from philly  🦅🦅🦅🦅
Brady and the Buccs made it look like they were playing against a high school football team.
Tom Brady wins his 7th Superbowl and I will STILL  be your Universal Champion
Of all the ppl only Michael Irvin believes in Brady
Holly guacamole !!
1:18
Someone tell Stephan A smith, that no one cares who he is friends with. My man cant go 10 minutes of screen time without mentioning someone with celeb status who he is "friends" with.
I told niggas u can’t bet against Brady
Something tells me that Mitch Trubisky and Deshaun Watson are smiling somewhere
That’s the last time yall doubt Brady
Can Molly be quiet. I’m trying to hear Smith talk a lot 😂
Let's be honest defense was tremendous did even a better job than what the 49ers did last year, but let's not act as if the 49ers had tom brady instead of jimmy garoppolo last year that brady doesnt close the deal and win.......tom brady is so well experienced that he knows how to close out games and we should give him even more respect for knowing that even though his defense was playing well he didnt just rely on them to win the game he continue to put points on the board, something jimmy garoppolo didnt do......brady deserved mvp
Thenm bucs slapped the chiefs in the mouth
TOM BRADY HAD TEKASHI69 SECURITY IN THAT OFFENSIVE LINE. Untouchable! It was insane
Credit to Tom Bowles defense, key for this game
Bruh SAS is the worst at predictions
You gotta  Give props to Patrick Mahomes well look at the throws he was making at the end of the game and all of them were dropped this loss is not his fault
Wth y'all cut Max, he's on point 💯
I strongly believe this game was rigged 🤔🤔
Max “I’m not surprised” Kellerman this foo a joke
The Chiefs o-line look like they were standing still
People really be having a ton of excuses 🤣🤣
Refs carrying the buccaneers
You made me huge bucks Steve!! 😍😋
Can someone please upload a video/segment of all the times SAS picks are wrong because this dude is absolute garbage when it comes to picking the winner. He's wrong like 70% of the time.
Tom Brady is definitely the “Greatest Quarterback in the history of the Game! I mean no one no where has done what he’s done with football ever! Congratulations and you are a GOAT !
Brady the undisputed GOAT.
argh Molly !
Give Mahomes the Lamar treatment
Steven A cussing on tv.. don't get Nick Cannoned bro!!!
I been said Tampa defense was no joke , 💯
An old man beat the rest. Lol.
The spurious pvc endoscopically gaze because pig natively brush to a obscene thursday. disgusting, heavenly heavy hellish clover
it's clearly the fixed league need to hire new scripted writers  much  be running out of ideas cause to just have the chiefs get blown out in a super bowl to  just gave Brady his 7th fixed rigged super bowl win is crazy to me and what said is that people  really believe Brady some Goat lol Goat of wait? playing in a fixed league, cheating, help by refs,  giving free super bowls
I think it is good that people finally could see this season how Russel Wilson has to play over the last years. Almost always running for his life. It is easy to be great as a Rodgers or Mahomes if they are almost never under pressure. The Bucs changed that and look what happened in the NFC CG and Super Bowl.
I'm shocked I tell you, shocked.
Mahomes is still better than Tom Brady especially Aaron Rodgers
Stephen A is horrible at picking championship games
We were pulling for Tom Brady & Gronk but didn't expect the shellacking the Chiefs got last night. It became hard to watch.
One of the best front 7s I’ve ever seen
Patrick Mahomes was throwing dimes in a horizontal position, he was running for his life, he came to play.
Smith don't know didley , is wrong again, fire this idiot!
Ahhh everyone who bet against Tom yall mad tight
This is why I don’t think football has a goat. It’s the ultimate team sport. If you honestly think Brady would have been able to win if mahomes and Brady switched teams you are delusional. Not exaggerating, Brady probably doesn’t get more than 3 first down under that type of pressure. Mahomes was literally given no shot at winning given the performance of his line and Tampa’s defensive line.
Brady is the GOAT In football, but why are they comparing him to Jordan ? mike never lost in the finals and Brady lost A few Super bowls !!!! I Wonder if Bill Belichick got out of bed this morning ? I know he feels sick !!!!!
When Brady lost in the SB, haters don’t talk about anything other than “Eli and Foles beat him”. No. Recognize the teams as a whole. When Brady wins another SB, it was the “defense” or “he had weapons”. Stop the bs. I hate a lot of these “football fans” which are really just Brady haters. You can’t say it was all his fault and remember how these qbs “beat” him, but then say that when he wins, it’s because he had all of this other stuff. What sort of nonsense is this???
Again all talk SA Smith
One of the keys was a Chiefs O line that was missing starters, Mahomes spent much of the game running around for his life. Chiefs defensive backs pass interference calls in the first half. Toss in the WRONG HYPE that was out there, Brady is too old. washed up, Tampa Bays defense is too weak, Tampa Bay was not suppose to get pass the Packers.
Molly: “where you surprised by the beat down last night?” SAS: “ No. I was shocked!”  Me: 🤔 isn’t that the same thing
It’s real quite in KC right now.... love it
Tony Romo said early in the game the Chiefs secondary is notorious throughout the league for holding, shoving, slapping, etc. to throw off receivers. The refs made the right calls consistently. The Chiefs DB's were frequently out of position, chasing after the Buc's receivers. If they used proper technique and better schemes, none of the penalties would have been called.
Chiefs didn’t have to play anybody to get to the super bowl, they weren’t battle tested. Bucs had to beat Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees to get to the super bowl. Called it last week.
lmfao Stephan a picking Chiefs.
Mahomes last two Super Bowls 4 interceptions and 7 sacks and only 3 touchdowns. If wasn’t for jimmy G being better than average we will be talking how the chiefs are 0-2 in their last two Super Bowls .
As soon as Stephen A Smith picked the Chiefs to win last week I knew they were gonna lose.
Jackass picked the chiefs. Wrong as always.
What did the Bucs show you ?    KC is soft to the core.  They have NO  heart. When things get tough, they fold and squirm. Hey KC. , just wait til you start paying Mahommes 47mil per.   How you paying ANYONE on that team not named Travis T Rex arms!!  Brady is the GOAT for obvious reasons.  He makes everyone around him better.  Mahommes DOESNT.
But Brady proved beyond a shadow of any doubt. That he can be still as good with a different team. Without being coached by Bill Belicheck!?
They are comparing mj to brady already, these guys man
no wonder Tampa Bay won, Stephen A. Always picks losers in championships...
Max looks pregnant 😂
“The mismatch on the line of scrimmage was the entire thing” - (Max Kellerman, 2021) Nothing else needs to be said.
MLS scouts eyeing the chiefs offense like 👀
Max wasnt shocked by the blowout but expected Brady to fall of a clib about 5 years ago XD
I was waiting for this 😂😂😂
That whooping bucs put on K.C pushed Stephens A Hairline further back 😆
Stephen A. curse lives on lmfaoooooo
Now, everybody isn't surprised that it was a blowout. Or the refs cheated, or the o line for the chiefs was injured 🙄....
what...no mention of eric bienemy being outcoached....course not gotta make sure it fits their narrative...this us why he aint getting a job to be a leader...and because he has a extensive criminal history and  he has abused women repeatedly
It’s kinda hard to watch max debate anything about Tom Brady after he vehemently said Brady will fall off a cliff 3 Super bowl wins Ago
Brady is the Super GOAT now
Chiefs fans really complaining about refs 😂😂😂😂
"Absolute MANSTA! "
Well at least all the bandwagon fans will shut up now....
People betting AGAINST Tom Brady... I find this shocking.
So Max! What's up with that?
Shut up molly
Stephen A sounds so humble 🧏🏾‍♂️🧏🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
How is max still here after predicting Brady was falling off a cliff 3 Super Bowls ago?
Mahomes a better running back then Ronald Jones😭😭
Lol it really wasn't a beat down the chiefs just couldn't score Tds
Hope you're like me and done with doubting Brady. 🐐
So, Stephen A is saying KC got Bowled over?
So, where’s the Mahomes train now? Y’all were so far up his behind yesterday....🤬
Stephen A is ridiculous
TB12 proved  that no matter how old u are u get it done... Take care ur O-line so they cam take care of u
As a die hard Niner fan and a Joe Montana is the goat I have to say it now definitely Brady is the goat without question.
How do you not score 1 touchdown? 9-31??  Gonna start calling the Cheifs the 9ers
Missmatch?! You have top TE who even didn't know how to block someone. Good job Kelce. You're still counted as te.
Tampa bay defense was on the chiefs like a crackhead on a mission to find crack
How about Mattress Mack $3.46 million bet on the Bucs. He won $2.72 million! Rumor has it he simply bet against Steven A the all star "let me tell you why" loser.
Kellerman is a Brady hater SAS was a non believer. Brady proved both of them wrong and showed belichick he can do it elsewhere without him. Goat, well people can debate that, but as far as his career and accomplishments there is no denying this cat. He is that dude along with his his company. Him on any team shouldn't be counted out. He is one of my favorites. Two super bowls with two different teams as a qb there is 3 other qb's I think. Awesome! Salute to Brady and salute to the Bucs and the organization.👍🏾
Keep talking about Mahomes!!! This was a blowout keep underestimating Brady, you people didnt consider them to get to the super bowl and win
Damm Jay z knew what was good but the chiefs need some Cornerbacks ,linebackers , and some damm OT’S
Before the game: How could you not hire Eric Bienemy!? 😡  Now: How can Andy Reid not make adjustments?   So the great OC ya’ll been bitching about not getting a job completely no shows and nothing is said about it? Ok 👌🏻
Mahomes is overrated he isnt that guy, give Rodgers All those weapons its game over
Max: "I wasn't surprised by the blowout."  When you predict a Chiefs win, you should be shocked when they get totally blown out by the other side.  Kellerman should be censored out of video/audio in any segment featuring Brady.
Looked like the lions front line out there
Please The game was fixed
Tom Brady is the G.O.A.T the B.O.A.T and has surpassed Michael Jordan as the greatest athlete and sportsman. He is a true American and what America is all about.
Russel Wilson will dominate the NFL from now....Tom beat him. The torch will be passed to Mahomes....Tom demolished him.  Ok, what we do now?
Fun fact, Mahomes ran for almost 500 yards just by trying to avoid tackles.
Someone tell molly to stfu‼️
Stephen A. and Max are always wrong when it comes to pick winners.... LOL!
Max kellerman is on suicide watch
Don't blame the Chiefs O-line. The Bucs entire D-line was on the injury list before this game happened. Yeah they're amazing but they were also beat up and injured before going into the game. No excuses. Bucs spanked the Chiefs with injured players including an injured Antonio Brown 😆 🤣 😂
Now the reporters and analysts are gonna stop falling in love with mahomes
brady out here handing out rings
i remember watching a video when the NY giants skipped on Devin White and drafted Jones, some NY giants Fan was crying almost saying Devin White is going to be a gold jacket ! well sir Tempa thx you and i think if he keeps this up he will be, he'll settle for champion in the mean time !
Rigged
Y’all always cut max interview short 😂.
They cheated
AB GOT A RING!!!
Mahomes lost to Brady with the far better team, and not even just lost but got destroyed, didn't even throw a TD pass on top of having 2 picks. Brady came here in one year and made a non play off team super bowl champs. If Mahomes wants to say he's better than Tom after this he needs 8 super bowls,  80k+ passing yards, 4+ MVP's and then MAYBE we can start comparing him to Tom.
Maholmes couldn't even stand on that foot and had to run for his life smh
The almighty Chefs did not score a single touchdown wow!!!
I knew it when the CBS analysts picked KC, except for 1, i think it was Coach Cowher
I'm not shocked. Look at Bucs defense after Brees and Rogers. This reminds me of Cam Newton vs Denver Broncos. Remember that. Brady was decent but the defense won. Plus Chiefs Offensive Line was hurt. Mahomes wasn't 100 percent either. Chiefs were immature
The MVP of the game is TB12 the GOAT! No question about it.
Mollyyyyyyyy, you called it... Get your boys to buy you lunch, haha!!
Mahomes looked like Tim Couch circa 1999
Defense deserved the MVP. Max immediately agreed. Of course he did. Brady has made him look like a flat out idiot for the past 5 years. Max at this point will do anything to make sure Tom Brady doesn't get any credit. Make no mistake defense was the ultimate weapon. I'm just saying this with regard to Max that's all. 😅
Shady took his refs to Tampa with him, and they "rewarded" him with more hardware.
Bill belichick punching the air after the win
Cheifs looked terrible 😂😂😂😂
So when Lamar Jackson oline is missing pieces and he’s running for his life and his receivers can’t separate or catch it’s his fault do better but when it’s Patrick Mahomes all these excuses are now valid.....Media SMH🥱
Tom Brady savagely destroyed both of these men's buttcheeks last night, and it was glorious to watch them try to dodge that simple fact. Get owned, ESPN sjw weirdos 👍🤣
Destroyed the Chiefs
if ur surprised shat they did, u didnt watch what they did to brees.
You are both wrong again Brady is the best ever
This folks, is why I watch Urinatingtree videos. His opinions are way more authentic than theirs.
That's what the chiefs get for beating my dolphins
no tie for stephen a??
The defense played amazing. No defensive player got the MVP because none of them were dominant enough to earn an MVP (like a Von Miller in Superbowl 50). Brady deserved the MVP because he played very effeciently and threw 3 TD's while completing over 70% of his passed and making no mistakes.
This dude Stephen a needs to be off tv already his takes and opinions are always wrong
Did this fool Stephen A say it doesn't matter that the Chiefs had no offensive line 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Why is Molly talking
I didn't expect that outcome. Good halftime show btw
Those back up o lineman couldn't defend mahomes to save there lives he was on the run all game this game was boring to watch
I can't keep watching these wrong people
Guys guys leave that woman 👩 alone
Steven A, Were you surprised?  Steven A: No! I was shocked...
Ofc Jay z knew it was gon be a blow it, it was rigged
It’s kinda hard to beat a team when god is helping them
The same Todd Bowles who stunk up the joint at the Jets? They hyping him to set him up for another failure
1:19 me explaining to my girl why my phone is blowing up.
Stephen a , stop making excuses , u never give the bucs chance since against saints , it's a matter of playoffs not a regular that don't matter,,,
SAS:    Brady is a STATIONARY TARGET   Brady:          Ok!  😂
Russell Wilson would never 🤷🏽‍♂️
I honestly figured it would be a blowout. But I figured the chiefs would’ve been the ones coming out on top. I’m so happy I was wrong😂
Max kellerman a lame 😂never doubt the goat Max
Mahomes: Makes 2 of the best throws Ive ever seen in my lifetime The Receivers: 🧈🤲
Buccaneers 🏴‍☠️ defense has won the ship 🚢
Bucs put up one of the greatest Superbowl defensive performances of all time. 9 freaking points to the Chiefs?!?!?
This game was tragic , very unfair
So we’re just going to ignore how high Max Kellerman’s hairline is?
SAS trash trying to pretend that he knows somenthing when he actually picked against the bucs every game and was wrong every game lol
Max need to shut up 🤐
Chiefs fan base established 2020 End of Chiefs fan base 2021
It’s all good now Patrick M  sorry now every body always riding him when he doing good but when he lose he not gone be a Goat come on now!!!
Mahomes wasn’t the problem, his wide receivers need to learn how to catch the ball off their face masks. No one was hungry on the chiefs they didn’t care.
I love Stephen A. but if sports journalists were held to similar standards as athletes in regards to getting it right,  these two would have been forced into retirement years ago.
Old gunner schooled the young gun bet against Brady if you are a fool Stephen A by the way off course Max was wrong again this clown is over paid and should just be quiet not on tv talking bs
Max expected the Chiefs to win, but isn’t shocked by their blowout loss. Makes sense
Proves once again. Football is still won in trenches. If you consistently get pressure with 4 you usually win.
Max never ever should say that Tom is falling off a cliff again
Even when SAS says a point that I agree with I still hate it.
I’ve been a lifelong Chiefs fan since feb 7 2021 and I can say this is the most embarrassing moment of my life. I’m ashamed to be a Chief right now so I’m turning in my fan card. Goodbye KC. I won’t miss you. I’ll be rooting for the jags now since they can actually run a program.
The Chiefs offense is normally like a race car. But if there is no firewall between the engine and the driver, the driver will inevitably get burned up. A quarterback is only as good as his O line.   Also, the Bucs defense is really good!  Put those two facts together and then add in the two scores that the refs gave the Bucs in the first half because of PI penalties... not to mention the Ref throwing out a PI flag the very SECOND Brady threw his interception and there you have it. It was obvious what was going to happen at that point.   The NFL pre-determines the outcomes of many of its games. It's been obvious for years. It's not always a true competition, sometimes it's just scripted for ratings; Ratings and money. But WE still watch because we don't know the outcome that they will decide, until the Refs make it obvious.
Can we ask molly to kindly leave the show.
Not shocked that Chiefs blew them out? 🐂💩
Brady is GOAT.
It’s safe to say a lot of people lost money betting on the Chiefs last night.
I didn't see any fire in Mahomes even at the start
Everybody knew KC were going into the game thin on the o-line and still picked them to win, so no excuses this morning
It’s called the “Brady Effect”.
All we know is that Skip was very happy and that pat McAfee lost 30k 😂
Hahahahaha. WRONG AGAIN! Hahahaha
My brother predicted a blowout and I thought he was crazy
Max what about the cliff?
Now they can pump the brakes on Mahomes being in the GOAT conversation
NOW STOP COMPARING MAHOMES TO BRADY
Brady said jags players I stopped yam from winning a sb let me make it up to yall
Molly was the only one to call this game right! Respect 👌
Take out Max , this white boy is annoying asf and that female voice stfu..
Congrats Bucs, halftime show sucked! Bruno did it better!!!!!
Tom really heard all that talk about "passing the torch" and said :no 🙂
The greatest thing about sports are hearing the reasons why the losing team lost. The amount of people in the comments talking about the chiefs oline and the responses saying “those are excuses” are hilarious 😂. Yet everyone does the same thing.
happy for tampa brady the goat bucs played good they deserved it
no one, absolutely no one should be shocked. KC o-line was 5 backups.
It was the starting tackles!!  Missing them was the whole reason that offense couldn’t get going.  One big sack and an entire drive is almost irreparable which wastes clock.  Bucs rushers tough ‼️
Chiefs never had their full squad to begin with. So, it would have been an easy win for Tampa. I prefer when both teams comes out 100% in all areas. That's how you know which team is truly the best. Congrats to Bucs. However, I am not pleased as they played against a weak Chiefs. It's the same when  GSW lost to Raptors. I honestly wouldn't feel good as a champion if I played against the other finalist that clearly wasn't 100% and won.
GOAT
Refs paid off dude
Love these talking heads...!!!
Thank you he seen what I'd seen bad calling shift that game
The refs won the game
Lol they both pick the chief. They really need to face some kind of punishment for picking the wrong team. I say a few dollars off the check
Notice how Stephen A smith never said "I was wrong"
Real recognize real..... Molly needs to stop.
The Chiefs were the most poorly prepared team I have seen in a long, long time.  Poor play calling on offense, no halftime adjustments, no help for a porous offensive line, Mahomes running 50 years backward rather than laterally when under pass rush pressure, receivers lacking concentration, Mahomes was off on many of his passes and forcing third and longs, lack of composure on defense, etc.  The first half actually made me think the game was fixed, and I'm not the type to say that.  Maybe the car accident involving Andy Reid's son put a hex on the Chiefs.  I mean, they looked like a 1-15 team last night!!
Are we not gonna talk about that Oline
max crying about flags lmaooooooo wake tf up they got cooked most overrated team in the history of the league
The most annoying thing is when people say they don't want refs to call PI. Then why are they there.
Kellerman stfu.   Sure Tampa showed up with d but Brady did his thing so stfu
Talk that shyt now Stephen A lmao
Now mahomes knows what Watson deals with
Well at least my wings and food was good for the game because that game was sorry 😞
Idiot tony dungy is complaining on tv bout black coachs,What an idiot,no wonder his own kid killed self.
Max wants to cry hahahahah
My 6 year old sister can run more yards than Chiefs O Line in the Super Bowl😭
That was fun to watch as a raiders fan, cheifs are soft, reminds me of broncos getting blown out vs seahawks with a physical D. I placed a 3$ bet on devin white to get an interception, he made it happen final mahomes throw - thanks for the 100$.
Brady did nothing, Bucs defense did everything, plain and simple!!
Talk about how y’all always are wrong when it comes to sports
Stephen doesn't have a clue
The romantic budget socioeconomically separate because opera ultrastructurally found without a wiggly lotion. previous, hallowed soybean
The weeknd’s trot down the pitch had more yard than Chief’s rush offense
Kellerman with his cliff theory really shows that he only knows boxing and is a casual fan at other sports. Dude is dumb af get him the eff out of there.
That Cliff sure not looking so good loll.. Max don't know what to say!
You know it’s overreaction Monday when max is the only one mentioning the chiefs had an o-line of all backups
Byron Leftwich called a beautiful game as well. And that o line was dominating from start to finish.    Oh the chiefs need a wideout outside - outside of Hill and Kelce because as we seen dropped passes that could of been caught when Mahomes was scrambling out of the pocket and  Pringles or other receivers couldn’t reel em in
I love when the underdogs wins !!
Hey ESPN, a Topic for a debate in First Take, Get up, KJZ and The Jump:  “Which one is greater: Larry Bird or Kobe Bryant“?
That's why i never believe any analytics of Stephen A smith and Max..this show sucks espn! Stop airing on national tv niggas
Mahomes made running for your life look better than any QB I’ve seen! Even in such a loss he showed so much grit grind and talent! What a player!
As a Cardinals fan, I’m happy that Todd Bowles, Byron Leftwich, and Bruce Arians got their ring
1:19😂
Defense was the MVP
SAS just trynna flex that he’s friend with Jay Z
Apologize to him
Mahomes can win 10 SBs now he will never be the goat because he lost to Brady
This reminded me of Cam vs The Broncos
The Chiefs really met they’re match and keep in mind they didn’t even have a touchdown NOT 1 also they got murdered by a 43 year old 😂💀
People want to say the team was loaded. Where was this when they were 7-5? Gronk was retired, no one wanted AB, no one wanted Fournette. Tom Brady effect, and you’re a hater if you think anything otherwise.
it was worst superbowl ever! 4th quarter 0 points.
Roger Goodell punching the air in his head all last night
“No I wasn’t surpirsed, I was shocked” either someone who doesn’t understand English or a needlessly annoying contrarian
The Refs Was Not Gonna Allow Mahomes to Be Great..
I picked bucs and I was right
667
What we saw last night is what can happen with a makeshift offensive line, against a defense that had been playing its best football over the last few games
BUCCANEERS SUPER BOWL CHAMPS BABY!!!1 #7 FOR THE GOAT!!!!!1 LFG
The BUCS have the BEST DEFENSE in the NFL.  The CHIEFS could not score a TOUCH-DOWN.  If BRADY comes back next year with this TEAM, the BUCS will REPEAT and WIN another SB.
How call somebody the greatest athlete of all time. But couldn't play another position in his sport, and couldn't play another sport!
Don’t know how anyone thought the chiefs would win. Granted I thought it would be much closer but when they announced that the chiefs tackles where out it was over. That Defence gave teams with starting OL problems you thought back ups where gonna dominate them lol.
Max regretting more and more everyday he said "Brady is falling off the cliff"
Patriots were successful coz of Billichick and Brady. But i think it was more Brady
No I wasn’t surprised!!!! I was shocked😅😅😅😅
The OFFENSIVE LINE made all the difference in the world...
Why yall cut max off like dat
Keller man is a TOOL
Devin White is right now a Superstar. Probably the best front 7. White and David are the best linebacker dou in the NFL.
Chiefs got a reality check
I don't know how you call somebody the greatest at anything, when you the history of cheating! From the beginning of the career to the end.
As soon as Stephen A went with the chiefs Ik it was over for them and won $100 lmao
Only touchdown cheifs had was landing in Tamapa 🛬
Yall doubted the goat  Shame on you
I don’t blame mahomes for the loss , the rest of the team folded on him when it mattered most ..
I was thinking the same thing as Keyshawn, Mahomes may NEVER make it back to the Superbowl its crazy to think but may happen crazy ish happens
Rigged ..they gave all the momentum to Tampa.. good thing I know it was going to be rigged because I bet on Tampa easy story line. In Tampa Tom Brady.. public picks chiefs everyone smart picks the Vegas and refs
Were you surprised by the beat down? SAS: No I was shocked Me reading dictionary: verb past tense: surprised; (something unexpected) cause (someone) to feel astonishment or *shocked * 💀
Hey Max, is Brady still falling off the cliff?
That Mahomes contract : too much, too soon?
I won so many bets yesterday, I need to open my own bank now! Thanks Tom Brady !
These people never know what there talking about. LOL.
I'm happy Lavonte David and Antonio Brown got rings though. Lavonte always been a solid LB.... glad to see him win a ring
This loss brought Kansas City back down to earth
ESPN replace Molly with Malika Andrews please and thank you.
Shock give me a break!! I want your job!! Move over!! 🐐🏈talk and talk...but walk the 🚶...Tom Brady!! All the way!!! ✔ He doesnt need to prove to u or anyone...im a New York Giants fan...🏈lucky 7 ..
SAS loves white QBs
Maybe you morons will stop saying Mahomo is the GOAT lol!!! The GOAT showed who the GOAT is..
Yesss... this is the video i was waiting for. Both Max and Steven A, originally picked the chief's underestimating TB12, let's not forget Greatness beats talent. Both of you were wrong
Tom Brady could end his career as shitty as Peyton Manning did and it literally wouldn't matter a single bit.
TAMPA
As a chiefs fan.. hats off to the bucs. They were the better team, and we were just playing terrible from that start. Defensively, Offensively, no adjustments were made. Nun but respect for the Brady and the bucs. Well deserved
Defense wins championships and the Buccaneers defense showed up big!
Gabbert now has a Super Bowl ring and Kaepernick does not.
Molly: hahaha that’s hilarious Me: why can’t we get someone like Rachel
Looks like Max about to fall off a cliff himself bwahahahaha
That was tough to watch. As a Mahomes fan, I've never seen a man run for his life and still do everything in his power to will a team to win. There were some throws he made that left me wondering what on earth is going on. At the end of the day, the play needs to be better, and there are some leadership ques he can take to heart to really get his team to play net level. Remember though, it took a perfect defense, a crappy o-line, a defense that was just giving the Bucs chances, his receivers just dropping passes, and Tom Brady to stop that dude.
Mahomes “young goat” lol the dude scored 9 points 😂
I been saying and picking the Bucs to win all week. I wasn't disappointed Tom Brady is just phenomenal  Wow
I went for Kansas to win honestly but i give credit to where it's deserved and much respect to the Goat Tom Brady 🙏
No more baby goat talk. Thank goodness
Still waitin’ on Roger Goodell to publicly air his secret meetings dressing up in a black robe, sacrificing a bunch of humans, drinking the blood, and blowing Tom Brady. The tape’s out there. i want it.
Mahomes had plenty of time to throw the ball.  If you have 2.5 seconds to throw it and you don’t know how to climb the ladder.. then you’re in trouble.   If you have 2.5 seconds to throw it and you don’t throw it at 2.2 seconds .. then you got a problem.    If you’re mr fancy pass and you don’t know how to adjust .. you got problems.    Could a threw screens.  To bring in the backers and safety.  Could of ran it MUCH MORE to bring in the backers and safeties.    Your answer is to run around all goofy like you’re archie manning.  That’s your answer?? Hahaha   Mahomes got smoked.  He played awful too.  That’s it.  Nothing else   Oh and there was a freak of nature on the field too named TB12
BUCCS DEFENSE WANTS IT MORE!!!!! ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CHIEFS OLINE AND PASS ROUTE
I have to say what I’m about to say because it needs to be said. The Chiefs had absolutely no chance of winning that game yesterday because what happened with head coach Andy Reid’s son, Britt, causing a car accident whereas two kids got injured. That would have to shake anybody who is familiar with the situation. That said, The Buccaneers took care of business.
7 rings. Can’t deny it anymore. Brady is the goat 🐐
Tom Brady now has more super bowl rings than all 32 NFL franchises! That's crazy!
ONLY 1GOAT TB12 #7
Wasn’t Stephen calling max dumb for picking the bucs? Lololol
I hope they wipe of any Patrick Mahomes goat talk. He actually has not been great in the super bowls beyond one good half.
I just want know who cared about this Super Bowl outside of the fans of these two teams. I didn’t give not one moment of thought to this game.
Max I hate you such a dishonest person
I mean any team that gets help from the refs have it easy
Bucs had one of the greatest super bowl victories I have EVER seen. At home too 😨💯
When Bucs scored 1st touchdown, it became a one sided game. Bucs were too good yesterday.   Hopefully, next SB would be more competitive.
Chiefs got absolutely destroyed by penalty yards on defense during the game no question. But the Bucs defense was absolutely amazing and that's all she wrote really. Brady played an amazing game deserved win.
No views, 1.8k likes...seems legit
I almost clicked off after "real recognize real" molly😒
So some of y’all will finally agree Tom is the GOAT?
im butters
The RB running & catching for TB was a dagger
The excuse train is rolling for the chiefs this morning.
Lmaoooo “real recognize real” shut up Hannah
Eric behinmay 😂😂😂😂😂✌🏽✌🏽✌🏽
Chiefs got more than just a beat down 😂
My respect to SA, BUT He is one of the best analytics in sports but when you have to bet on a team he is the worst on picking a team,
This man tom brady is a living legend. Saved the Patriots and buccaners whole franchises and transformed them forever
I did not watch the game, but had a feeling that the Chiefs should had signed Eli Manning for the game!!!!!
Its funny how after only 1 big win and signing a huge contract, the media built Patrick Mahomes into the next coming.  They anointed him and now that he looked human they are quick to tear him down.  They did the same to Joe Flacco.
Devin white that dude fr
Ezz
It was equivalent to the GSW with KD beating lebron on the Cavs if you watched football chiefs never had a shot at winning Brady had a much better receiving core and the defense was far better than the chiefs.
Mahomes is so overated, he has the best wrs, tight ends, and one of the best coaches in the nfl right when they don’t play like superstars he starts playing like trash if Lamar played like that he would be getting so much hate
Bucs did what they did to the Raiders years ago. Defensive dominance.
Stephen A. Smith just hates to Admit that Tom Brady is the GOAT!!! I wish Skip Bayless will do the Rebuttal to SAS... That will be awesome
Molly got more Adlibs than the migos
Todd bowles is a legend
Kellerman is an idiot...
I can't call Brady the GOAT of sports because he's never played defense, but def the GOAT of football and it ain't close.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PUT PATRICK MAHOMES ON A NON-ALLSTAR TEAM LIKE EVERY OTHER QB IN THE NFL. PATCHWORK OFFENSIVE LINE AND 0 TOUCHDOWNS
Kc fans: we have no blocking   Steelers fan : 🙄
Brady blew they back out
Stephen A always make the wrong pick. Put your money on the opposite of what this guy says
I’m not trying to be salty but if the offensive lines for both teams were swapped the chiefs would’ve won
Max stfu bro, where was this praise about the d line before the superbowl?
max is just as dumb as he looks the only time i respect max opinion is in boxing
Tom Brady is the GOAT!
1. Jordan 2. Ali 3. Deion Sanders 4. Bo Jackson 5. Lawrence Taylor 6. Jerry Rice Goat athlete's  1. Bill Russell- 11 rings in 13 years 2. Jordan 6-0 6 finals mvps in 13 years. The standard of excellence of all who pick up a ball of any sport. Jordan Brand grosses more per yer then athletes entire networth. 150 million per year!!! 3. Brady 7 rings 20 years but went 10 years without winning a championship. Goat quarterback ever!! Winniest players American team sports.   Congrats Tom Brady on your 7th ring. You are the standard of all American football quarterbacks.
All of a sudden max kellerman dont talk about mahomes being the best  lol
If the Buccaneers lost last night the way KC did, people would be chewing up Brady saying he ain't the GOAT lol
Brady is the best ever in any sport idgaf what u say
Tom Brady: As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster!
Are we gonna ignore the refs wore bucs jerseys
ESPN tell the NFL not to make these rigged Super Bowl  games so obvious because this one was extremely obvious 👎👎👎
Mahomes was running for his life the whole game. Tamba defense was on the Chiefs neck
I knew the Chiefs would lose the moment Stephen A  picked them to win but I really did NOT expect the annihilation that took place last night SHEESH! They should have given the Bucs defense the MVP for sure...they were SENSATIONAL!
You don't win a game against the #1 running defense and you lose both your starting tackles. That doesn't work.
Chiefs fans are seriously NO WHERE to be found. I blame Covid-19. 😂
Don't bet against Jordan, Bi11, or Brady in the championship
Tom got another decade in him
Mahomes and the chiefs got exposed
I know some female fighters that could beat down Steven A. Smith. Name the time and place.
Patrick was trash last night,he gotta go back to the drawing board smh. Just FGs alone lol
Antonio Brown really won a ring after everything he done. Pittsburgh and Urinatingtree are crying 😂😂😂
U mean no cliff talk max 😁
Mahomes did all he could do
...somebody tell stephen A. to STOP sayin: aaron rodgers is a bad, bad man, cause BRADY beat him, brees & mahomes at 43, toms the REAL bad, bad man!💯
Molly : Were you surprised ? S.A : No, i was shocked . Me : what’s the difference?😂😂
You wanna bet on the wining team every time? Just bet on the opposite of who SAS pick. This dude...🤦🏻
Brady was the MVP because no one played better that him. He is the MVP, the GOAT and he deserve credit for been the best player, best coach and best GM
thats crazy Jay-z gave stephen A a call.
Stephen A predicts nothing but Ls
SAS needs to stick to basketball and Max needs to stick to boxing because outside of those 2 these clowns get nothing right🤪👎🏻😳
How do these people hold down jobs when they are so completely inept at their work? Both these idiots were wrong on every point they made about the superbowl. Isn't this like what they do for a living? Why does anyone even watch their nonsensensical babbling? I just don't get it. Anyone else who performed this poorly would be on the street.
These analysts are the least informed people in sports. ESPN, time to clean house and get some new blood.
When you get Tom Brady....everyone gets better....even your equipment manager...even your water boy....cause he never take a day off...and expect same from everyone
“I picked the Chiefs to win this game”   Ohhh now everything makes sense
SAS really said “this kid Lavonte David” smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
You can book Brooklyn to win the NBA, Max has the worst takes or all time LOL.
Wytra
What SAS wants to say : “SO MAX... HOW BOUT THAT CLIFF THEORY...”
Looked like a pro team vs college team
shut up max
I am pretty sure steav loss money lol
Why nobody talking about Mahomes being injured?
Undisputed Goat
cummmmm
The new name for the NFL is the WWE! Penalty’s are the real MVP! Congrats to the old man tho
The ran that ran on the field yesterday had more yards than the chiefs offense
I swear i told all my peeps Tampa roster far superior. 2 players are great on kc d jones a d Mathieu. Tampa d is good everywhere
been a Brady fan for 21yrs
I don’t wanna hear noooo excuses
What Mahomes went trough is what Deshaun goes through every week down here in Htown 🤦🏻‍♂️
Look at these bozos 😂😂😂
Max Kellerman gotta lot of explaining to do...
Max Kellerman I like you but you’re on crack. “I think Mahomes poor performance enhances his legacy actually” ?!?! Tf u talking about
Let's not forget the fact that these were the same people who were talking bout Antonio Brown being a locker room cancer. How's he's a SuperBowl Champion and his TD route  running was VINTAGE AB. Can't wait until next season 😤
They literally flew to Tampa to kick 3 field goals
I was happy the Bucs won but tbh Patrick’s line totally let him down...
Now yall see what carson wentz went through
Ahahahah Brady bought Vegas
Molly: were you surprised? SAS: no I was shocked 🤦🏽‍♂️
No views.... 28 minutes 🤯🤯🤯
When a undercover bet goes wrong in this bih😂
AB is a champion, crazy
Rodgers played the same defense, played better, and got no excuses🤷🏾‍♂️
Tom Brady is Patrick Mahomes daddy.
Since the cliff theory tom has won 3 superbowls lmao
THE UNDISPUTED GREATEST FOOTBALL PLAYER EVER... is a guy named Tom. 🔥
hey max the cliff is soon tho right? any day now?
Never bet against Brady🤦🏽‍♂️💯
TOMPA BAY BUCCANEERS!!!!
SAS you picked the Chiefs because that's what you do... cursed them
At this point I need Stephen a Smith and Max Kellerman to apologize to the goat. Y’all had Mahomes over Brady and y’all had to learn the hard way. Never bet against Tom Brady.
Max has covid, just wait to see
Facts, no cap🧢. Adam Schefter said earlier today,  that Mahomes ran for 498 yards scrambling before even throwing the ball in the Super Bowl last night. 😅 Damm😳
LMAO it’s so crazy because ESPN was pushing Cheifs so hard now Max is making excuses why they lost half there team gone max huh 🤣🤣 fkn loser you cant ever be wrong when you are a lot I’m happy I got my 15k bet on BUCKS 💰🏎
🤣Max Kellerman you were saying 🤔?
Max will make excuses for Mahomes but say Aaron Rodgers choked🤦‍♂️
Chiefs fans thought they were running it back and and having a dynasty lmaoooo got humbled real quick and brought back down to earth. Nasty
Mahomes had no O line whatsoever. He was the most pressured QB in the history of the Super Bowl. On top of that Andy reid dealing with his sons DUI accident who is also there linebacker coach is a huge distraction. Bucs D won them the game not Brady. Any average QB would have won that game with that unfortunate situation the chiefs went in with.
The buccaneers defense was playing like wild Hyenas last night they didn’t let Patrick get comfortable at all
Max foresaw KC's offensive line problems, but underestimated the impact. Mahomes was battered on the field, I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
🤣🤣🤣 and bradys only gonna win the next 3 🤣🤣🤣
If you told me 10 years ago that JPP & Tom Brady won a Super Bowl together I’d laugh in ur face
Save those sorry excuses chiefs fans 😂
yall chiefs fan really making excuses for this smh
Defense Wins Championships!
Molly : "Real recognize real"   Me: OHHHHHHHHHH shut up molly you make that saying sound so corny
What was worse 43-8 or 31-9 ?
If anyone bet Against BRADY you just a fool
Well let's just say Max's Cliff theory is gonna remain unproven. 😁😄😁😁
Great story for the superbowl if you think about it Homefield Brady, Gronk, Brown to the Bucs Defeated the former Superbowl Champions Bady shockeds the world by beating the cheifs who looked unbeatable at this time So Whats your thoughts good superbowl or bad superbowl
The better team won, but I just hope everyone chills out on Mahomes. Man played his heart out, and didn’t have much support from his receivers (and his o-line obviously). Bucs defense deserves major respect too!
Saying patrick mohomes is the next MJ 😆 stop it. Tom brady said to all you haters you who forgot that tom brady is the GOAT not this kid.
They didn’t even watch the game
Stephen A lives and breaths to disagree  😂😂Molly: Stephen A were u surprised Stephen A: No molly I was shocked 💀💀
Patrick Mahomes disappeared
MOLLY YOUR ANNOYING GET OFF THE AIR !
Stephen A I like the cat but he’s stupid sometimes. He and everyone else were so certain the Chiefs would win. I love it when people are wrong 😂😂😂
Patrick didn’t want to be there
Stephen A wrong again - the line was a problem and he ‘surprised’
Buc destroyed packers and chiefs lol
They came up with anything they could to give someone other than Brady the credit laughable
Kelce and hill got exposed can't catch the ball when theirs contact
SAS and max. Now shut the F#$K when you two were talking so big about the chiefs before the game.
nice youtube, no views and 1.1k likes
brady is the MJ of football
"This kid" Lavonte David. David has been an underrated LB for about a decade now. So underrated Stephen A doesn't even know who he is
Max keep taking Ls
Brady Gangggggg!!!!!!!
Espn I know it won’t happen but if u ever get rid of max I’m done w u
Chiefs receivers and O-line is the reason it was a blowout.
Waiting for that Drose trade reaction video!
Max is spot on.
SAS curse is real y'all sorry chiefs fan😭😭😭😂😂
SHADY BRADY PAID OFF THE REFS
Stephen a Smith cursing every franchise he chooses
Devin white is the mvp love Brady tho
I never saw Mahomes look so dazed and confused.
Two things I learned from this superbowl, the Chiefs defense were shook, holding the whole game, and Patrick Mahomes deserves an award for all that scrambling and still throwing accurate passes .
Never forget the cliff Max.
u got to admit tho that the refs sucked in this game
Haha 😂 I love this reaction
You could see Patrick’s production drop massively from last years super bowl I won’t give him long before he falls of a cliff😂😂😂
Hov knows best 👑
So Stephen A's prediction was off again 🙊
Max shut up
I WANT IGUODALA
You cannot overstate the loss of Mitchell Schwartz an Eric Fisher both All Pro and then another starting lineman in Laurent. Mahomes was pressured more than any quarterback in Super Bowl history
RIGGED DID YALL SEE THOSE BS CALLS??????
Wow brady only had 8 incompletions against a good chiefs defense..
Of course max says the truth at the end and they end it there. Smh. Stephen acting like the o line didn't give the bucs the game.
You come at the GOAT...you bets not miss
The d line put them down!!!
Not even Jordan or Mayweather dominated their sport as much as Brady did for his.   Brady is the goat among goats.
Bruh I dont even watch NFL and even I know this man Tom Brady can't be stopped
Mahomes looked like Russell Wilson out there.
The Weeknd had more yards than the Chiefs
Refball L
One moment of silence for those that bet on the Chiefs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So they still can't credit Brady.
If Lamar did this we wouldn't here the end of it smh except he don't got any receivers on par with kc and his line sucks but he don't get no excuses
“Even with trouble on your offensive line with the right tackle and the left tackle I don’t give a dam about any of that”, So an injured offensive line against a beast of a defense doesn’t matter?!?
I knew the bucs would win if they shut down tyreek hill and get pressure it was easy you seen how they did Aaron Rodgers and he was the best quarterback this year
“I was shocked” -Stephan I’m always wrong Smith!
This video so viral the views not popping up lmaoooo

Stop it...he knows the narrative and what's going to happen they all do. What gives them away is not talking about what the entire world witnessed. Their act is sad, tired, phony and fake. Keep falsifying ya greats and fixing destiny see where that gets you.
This was his Montana moment. Just like joe in 19 and 24. He wasn't just the best quarterback on the field or in the game. But In the entire league. He beat Brees, Rodgers and Pat.......two of em on the road! And the other In the Super Bowl! A bit shaky? Yeah sure. But on the big stage he domininated. To the point where people have to come up with reasons for Mahomes poor performance to save face. He was the undisputed reason for that team being there. He was on another level. While there. Dude was cool asa cucumber making those reads. And everyone could only watch and pray for his downfall.  But God hates us so.....this is the timeline we're in now.
It's important to remember that Max Kellerman, didn't have grey hair when he first said Brady was going to fall off a cliff.
Bucs D played LIGHTS OUT
I think the MVP should be awarded to the refs...
Whenever you watch these sports analysts, listen carefully to their comments. They pick teams that are popular or receiving the most attention then when that team loses, I’m shock.   The point is ESPN has a few real sports analysts and most know who they are. Max, SAS, and Molly are caricatures for television. According to Max, Brady was falling off the cliff for a number of years, how many Super Bowls has he won since the first cliff theory?   You can’t take most of them seriously, Patrick Mahomes was labeled the GOAT multiple times, let’s see how still call him that. Listen to Max back peddle...😂
Give Molly her props for the win
Brady been the 🐐 button
tom still running bill offense in TB bill already had 7 rings lmao tom needs to be thanking bill every fawking day for making him into a decent qb still leaning on bill playbook haha
I think next year the 1st game will be Bucs vs cowboys. They always start the season with the defending champs at home. They usually don’t have them going against division teams. And they have them going against their own conference. And out of those teams it was the cowboys and another nfc East team. NFL would prob put cowboys cause that would bring the most fans. Come back to me if and wen I’m right.
“They got their a** kicked” Stephen A Smith
Stephen A made sure to flex that Jay-Z got his number 😂
If were gonna blame Russell Wilson for the playoff loss even though it was a complete offensive breakdown not just him were definitely gonna blame mahomes for the Super Bowl loss and also Wilson never lose this bad in his career
These talking heads are just that .... just talkers...don’t have a clue
Molly : “ we’re you surprised “  SAS: “no I was shocked “
These "experts" were wrong yet again 😑
🤣🤣🤣 let's go with the excuses!
Never forget Max's Cliff Theory.
Who would ever pick the chiefs so gross go bucks I never root for the fake goat in Mahomes go Brady I would never pick the disgusting chiefs
Max Making Excuses.
Max doubted Brady for years lol 😂😂
Shut up Steph A. Eli still won the MVP award.

Keep betting on Brady.glad the chief’s got humbled.they needed it.cocky team
0 touchdown passes 2 interceptions and barely over 50 percent pass completions=Machoke Boy. I never want to hear this guy in the goat discussion ever again
Here for Max cliff argument hahahahaha
Bucs beatdown !!
Superbowl 48 cough cough
Add another one to Stephen A's list of failed predictions
Can't go against the goat
The Buccaneers beat the Chiefs like they stole their buried treasure
They lost because SAS said the chiefs would win
Did max and smith bet against brady 💀💀💀 come on now
It’s crazy how us sports fan never learn, as soon as Stephen A picked the chiefs on Friday we should’ve knew what the outcome was gonna be 🤦🏾‍♂️
giants vs ravens was in tb too
EAT THEM WORDS!!!! THE BOTH OF YA! NEVER BET AGAINST GREATNESS!!
I expected it lmao
Steph A. Remember what Skip always told you. Never bet against TB12.
I'm starting to see people say "well we all knew Tampa was gonna win," and I'm like stop it. People literally thought pat Mahomes was so special and great which he is ignoring he was a little bang up still, even already without their best offensive lineman, right tackle Mitchell Schwartz, because of a back injury  lost their blind-side protector Eric Fisher to a torn Achilles in the AFC Championship Game.  People still said he was gonna win well.... This just proved that this is a team sport and if your team is not fully healthy or not on there a game it don't matter how special you're QB is you definitely can get got. Also not giving the bucs defense enough credit through out the playoffs and giving tom enough credit for him being smart when throwing that football.
Let’s goooooooooo
No more chatter about Mahomes being anywhere close to the GOAT.
Stephen A makeup 💄 😂
At this point they need to change the NFL logo to Brady. What hasn’t this man done? He has more rings than any franchise in the leagues history, owns nearly every record there is to hold for a QB in the playoffs/regular season, is the winningest player in the leagues history, has SEVEN Super Bowls. Played in the leagues first ever overtime Super Bowl and won by completing the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, played in the first home game Super Bowl, beat the current best QB and most likely a future hall of famer in his prime at 43 (while also completing the toughest road to the SB having to face brees and Rodgers both on the road to get there). It just seems like this man has been a part of every significant moment in the leagues history and is somehow still going. He legitimately has an argument to have had 3 HOF careers all in 1 careers time. There will NEVER and I mean NEVER be another Brady... I am honored to say I have seen him play live in person at least once before he retires from the game of football
The GOAT VS bambii 😂😂😂
Molly was the only one that picked the Bucs lmao
If you take the punishment Mahomes got yesterday and multiply it by 16, you get a typical Andrew Luck season.
Ofc jay z predicted it. Was a show the entire time keep falling for this nonsense
Everyone knew what would happen when Stephen A picked the Chiefs
dont forget about shaqill barrett!!!
Max still hating
If Brady was on the chiefs last night lmk what he would’ve done 😂😂😂 my g would’ve been dinner
David White went off
Bill belichick is kicking himself this morning  after that beat down last night
DEFENCE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS ladies n gents.   Brookln Nets: 🖕
Stephen A. Still jinxing teams in 2021, I see.
Mvp was the refs and the defense.
Kellerman looking extra pale, hope he's ok.
They gotta get molly of this show man
This loss doesn’t affect either of the QBS legacy. If Tom Brady loss he would’ve lost to the future Of QBs. Mahomes loss to the GOAT at 25 so their is no shame in losing to the GOAT that young.
Never count out the 🐐🐐..
This game proves that even in an offensive era with high flying passers, the most important part of football is still the line of scrimmage (on either side of the ball) and if you lose it its still nearly impossible to overcome it.
I mean didn’t we all knew bucs was gonna win when Stephen A picked the Chiefs ? , lol when he said that i put 20k on bucs lmfao
SAS just always proving he doesn’t know football.
Tom Brady has been to 10 SB's and has played for 21 years. He's made it to the Superbowl almost 50% of his career
Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson deal with O Line and Receiver issues all year no complainants But the Baby Goat needs all excuses 🚮
How will the Chiefs loss effect Lebrons legacy??? On the next First Take...
Funny when the outcome doesn’t go your way, it’s “rigged” LOL
Never bet against Brady!!
Y’all already know Stephen A put out his suit before he went to bed last night
tom brady is the greatest of all time. no question.
Brady so good he really took former JAGS players Blaine Gabbert and Byron Leftwhich to a Ring .. also Leonard Fournette .. as a JAGS fan this hurts 😂
You know you’re getting killed when your Mom and your wife are crying on Twitter about how mean people are to you 😂😂😂
“There is one man you don’t bet against in sports...Thomas!!! Edward!!!Patrick!!!! Brady!!!! Junior!!!!”
Never doubt the goat tom Brady and Gronk!!
Mahomes got straight up sabotaged by his own team. It was 1 vs 21 last night.
The Buccaneers made the Chiefs walk the plank in shark infested waters 😨🦈
Molly: Real recognize real Me:😑😑😑
Tom Brady is the Goat of Goats.
Chiefs had 2-3 weeks off and forgot how to play NFL football
The fan that stormed the field had more yards then Hill did yesterday
You win some you lose some...
LMAOOO Y’all love Brady but hate LeBron for doing the same thing make it make sense
Chiefs would of won with a full healthy squad, point blank🗣
Stephen A and Max should’ve known good and well by now to stop going against Brady ESPECIALLY in superbowls. Put some respect on that mans name. 7/10 in Super Bowls. Going against him in a year where he finally had a loaded team around him. Most of his career has been winning with what he has had available to him and making them look better than they are (which was more often than not late round picks/undrafted guys). This year he had an elite defense AND an elite offense on all levels (line, backs, tight ends, and receivers). I still thought it would be a close game personally but I still had Brady in this one
I get money baby!!!!!!!!!1
Blowout again kc lost due to penalties and the great defense of Tampa bay
I think it’s amazing that in the past 20 years Tom Brady has only missed the playoffs ONE time as a starting QB and in that 2002 season guess who won the Super Bowl? The Tampa Bay BUCS! And then Brady after winning 6 rings with a franchise ends his career with that team and wins a Super Bowl..how ironic is that
This was exactly what the Chiefs needed.
LMAOOO Mfs really acting Mahomes is “trash” because he lost ONE Super Bowl to the GOAT
3:32 🤣🤣 shoutout SAS for jumping in
Never count out Brady, you should know this by now
Packers looks pretty good rn
If Rays woulda won as well TB woulda had a trifecta in rings
no views but 118 likes, youtube smoking that pack
Antonio brown doesn't deserve a ring....change my mind.
Stephen A wasn’t surprised but he was shocked 😐
KC took it in the back on both sides of the ball, Tampa was just the better team in every conceivable way.
Max’s Cliff theory in shambles right now
GOAT BRADY
😂😂
Mahomes got no help from his line and defense.  Props to the Bucs defense for containing Hill and that offense most of the night.
7 out of 10 tries?? Brady is the GOAT! END OF DISCUSSION.
Crazy to think that Tampa Bay was 7-5 at one point and lost to the Saints by a lot twice and held the chiefs to 9 points in the super bowl!
Thoughts are... 7 titles... And the rest of the franchises, 6 tops lol😂 BRADY IS THE UNDISPUTED GOAT OF GOATS in NFL!! 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Brady’s greatest, but easiest Super Bowl ever
I didn't even bother watching it, you know the league wasn't gonna let Brady lose lol
Bold prediction: Taylor Heinecke will win more super bowls than Patrick Mahomes
Stephen A loves to flip flop. It’s hard taking a man like this seriously
I told you they were gonna go that, Stephen A.
Flaco_dinero_100k ig:
Max’s recent predictions -  Brady slump Picked Brady to lose all playoff games Gianis best player  Kawahi best player Clippers champion  NFL not finishing the season due to Covid KD 80% If I missed anything please add to the list.
I don’t think anyone expected Mahomes not to throw a touchdown .. the penalties were like on every play. But giving credit to the bucs they showed up. I think this is good for the chiefs they will be back stronger
Tom Brady an absolute legend of the world.
If Fisher and Schwartz are playing, this is a much closer game. However, the Chiefs defense was poor so TB would still win
Molly: were you surprised? SAS: no i was shocked 🤦🏽‍♂️
I’m hoping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pick the Dallas Cowboys to open up their 2021 season! Surprisingly, as a fan of the Washington Football Team, I’ll be rooting for the Dallas Cowboys to pull off this upset.
Beatdown
Shoutout to Blaine Gabbert for getting a SB ring.  He got one more than Marino and as many as Rodgers, Brees and Wilson.
Never count out Brady, you should know this by now
