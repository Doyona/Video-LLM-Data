What movie is this cus it sounds familiar
I wish i could have gotten to meet Techno, but I'm glad I got to watch his videos, when I heard he passed It shattered my heart and I couldn't process it, I still cry whenever I think of him, but I laugh too whenever I think about all the dunny things he did, especially when it came to his reactions of protecting Phil from baby zombies, and than realizing I'm only 5 years and 4 days younger than Techno. He was after all born June 1st, 1999. Mine was June 5th, 2004. It was always funny knowledge for me that I was so close to him in age.
What was the adio from?
THE BROOKLYN 99 AUDIO AGG
What I'll always be reminded of when I see this video was that it was the last one I watched before his watching his so long nerds video 🥺 💗
How I see technoblade
B99 AAA 😭😭
So goddamn nostalgic bro
rip mr blade
Since when is Techno a minecraft hoglin
Terry’s voice fit techno for some reason
What’s the audio from?
“Do I even weigh anything to you?”  “No it’s like holding a couple of grapes 🍇 “  LMAOOO
Hi Lucler_Lucifer, I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me. Your videos showed me how beautiful animation could really be and I've been obsessed ever since. I start an animation course next month, wish me luck!
oh my god, I miss you techno.
i wish techno could see this :(
He would've liked this.
B99 AUDIO!
he so big 😍
Thats kinda hot
Just ship them! They’re actually cute!
... It's just a multiplayer server though.... I"m very confused.
"It's like carrying a couple of grapes."
The Real Secret Is The Friends We Made Along The Way
why is he hot
Nimona..¡¿IS A MEN!?
Uh…
Is it just me or is that animation of him kind of attractive?
Rest in peace Technoblade  Forever in our hearts
Rest In Peace Technoblade
Could use some more mouth movements
RIP tecno😊
"do i weigh anything to you?" "no. it's like holding a couple of grapes." 🤣🤣🤣
Now I understand morning the blood god in fact, iceman nights crying over it and lamenting about it only for it to come back when I saw the shorts that set the last few minutes of the video chat said he’s dead so that started all over again but you can’t grieve someone forever Not grieving them anymore doesn’t mean you don’t care
Damn why he kinda 🥵
Autobts roll out moment
you do not know just how much i love this version of techno
yoo did techno shape shit hell this would link so many animation togather
*get rid of tommy and put technoblades student retroblades*
Sense technoblades dead who will carrie on his legacy as the new king of Minecraft
I can't stop watching this, it scares me how many times I've watched it already
"No it's like holding a couple of grapes" 😂 #technobladeneverdies #bloodforthebloodgod #broklyn99
The drawing version of Technoblade makes him hotter.
dumb
Techno as a human pig hybrid makes sense
Oml i just realized you made this years after I watched it XD
Rest easy king 👑
Aaaaaa Brooklin nine nine reference 😭😭❤️
He kinda hot UwU
Hearing Jake and terry as them is making me laugh my butt of (original sound from Brooklyn nine nine, character Jake and terry
BL?
this is weirdly fitting
well that hot.
rip techno.
Oh I want him to pin me wtf-
Ngl... He looking fine 🤩✨
The little “yeah-“ is too cute ❤
Dear god i love how tommy looks like a kitten being held 😢❤ wait... TOMMYKITTY! 😢❤ oh god my heart-
I just love this animation, love the pig design, everything is neat!
Awesome.
BROOOKLYN 99 WON'T BE THE SAME ANYMORE AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH (Missed this video ig, lol)
I hope wherever he is, he's getting laid and having the most fun possible doing it.
hes a furry?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok, Techno being a shapeshifter that usually stays in his beast form is now my new head cannon.
RIP Techno :(
Why does the thumbnail slightly turn me on...
technoblade never dies!! ❤❤
you're my animation goal :3
tommy just wanted a apple give he one now *angry noises*
ah classic terry and jake scene, Brooklyn 99
I'm really, really, really sorry. But why??? You had to make techno blade so hot looking??!!?
I love this so much ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like this version of an orc
Jake Peralta as Tommy kinda works for his character.
Rip techno you will live on forever
That is cool.
Cool video!❤❤
I just realized that Technoblade turns into a hog. I honestly like seeing it. Not many human looking hog characters lately these years.
The big dude sounds like he has Avocato's voice actor.
O///O
Is that a Were pig? I’ve never seen that before….
sooooo techno was a wesen?
hear me out
Technoblade never dies 😔❤️
🤣😂😂🤣🫒😡🐗🐖
i still rememb him,rip technoblade
They need a mob update where everyone who named the pigs techno blade/ Alex to where they get a crown and a tiny red cape.    Change my mind. I dare you to try👇.
Now do it with carrots
Not a big fan of... well I don't actually know- is he a boar? Whatever, not usually a big fan of those! This guy though, phew. Hawt.
I like how techno can just switch forms
I’m assuming techno would have told Philza before tommy, but him telling tommy before Wilbur is interesting, since I would have expected him to not trust tommy with his secret
Rip Technoblade❤❤🕊️
Is this from a movie?
A fluidez da animação é tão satisfatória 😊
It feels so weird knowing that this was posted just a few days before techno died
techno being able to shapeshift into a pig form is such a good hc
Techno would actually say that lol
Coming back to watch this video makes me cry.
I always make sure to watch your videos atleast 5 times to catch every detail of the animation and incredible work!
Rip techno 😢❤
“It’s like holding a couple of grapes”   “Fuck you,bitch.”
,,A couple of grapes,,😂😂😆😆😂😂😆😆
now change it to "couple of orphans"
huh didnt know hes a werepig
R.I.P king 👑
Rip technoblade he was a great youtuber i will miss him and everyone else
OMG love technopig
Techno's voice sounds like Gorden Ramsey

Techno loves yoghurt
Tommy’s grunt actually sounded like him ????
Bro why did the like- voice sound like Tommy actually screaming   Edit: the voice when he got picked up.
I loved how you used Brooklyn nine nine😂😂

I like when Technoblade went from human to transforming to a giant pig
This is adorable 😂❤
BROOKLYN 99!
Long live the king…
My intrusive thoughts- PUNT THE CHILD!!!
Rest in peace techno😢😢
1yr later.. He's gone. :(
During Lara and ranboo's visit at the sbi's house for the hand in marriage of ranboo's adopted sister,then one day, Technoblade drags Tommy for a private conversation because he tells him to keep it a secret
I like this,
I like how tommy is just like "Selecting a gapple
No he said Ggs once
Bad thing that techno is dead😢
I love that Tommy tucks into the fetal position like a kitten or puppy like Techno's holding his scruff
0:05 0.0

All I need is techno saying couple of grapes, then I’m set for life!
im back here just to say that i need a fanfic about that XD

r34
Selling a couple of grapes for 4.99$
The classic Terry Jeffords audio 👌
Wow techno is strong but 😢 hes dead 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
We have no regrets lol
i literally was questioning  how he turned into a pig with ease
I love the animation
Where did his hair go?
THIS WAS AWESOME- OMG LMAO
Ummm (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)
It’s so accurate to what techno would say
🤣😂 oh my god he blushes!
I love the transformation and I think Techno would too, best of both worlds lol
Why is techno blade hot like why i just want him with me right now like how he is in the animation like i have fallen in love with him. He gives off daddy vibes and i love it 🥵😫😖
I think he got offended- 😂
I love it the animation is outstanding
What movie is this from, I forgot. I mean the voice lines btw
whats the movie?
😡stop milking Tecno blade death 😭
😊😊😊😊😊
rip Techno😢
Where this audio from??
Lol a couple of grapes
Omg I love the show Brooklyn Nine-Nine! This fits so well with them!
This was four days before
the end
This is so like my characters in transformation.
Where is this audio from q.q
THIS IS THE MOST AMASING ANIMATED THING EVER
I miss technoblade... we all do..
I love techno and Tommy’s designs
I don't know what I see in techno's face but Tommy really is weak and small(However managed to survive wars and such LMAO) and Techno MIGHT have regretted just doing that (just my therapy)
EXUSE ME WHERE IS HIS CROWN AND WHY IS TOMMY NOT SINGING JUMP IN THE CADILAC
Now go eat those apples boy
Whoa!!
99
♥️♥️♥️
THIS IS SO GOOD I HOPE TOMMY SEES IT!
It is from Brooklyn 99
Loving this idea.  Imagine, Techno honing that ability to become a beefier pig humanoid. And if he goes too far, he goes whole hog. XD
The concept he has both a human form and a more accurate form in this is a  cool idea
I NEED MORE DSMP+B99
*Technoblade trying to let Tommy keep the secret* Tommy: _G A P P L E_
Tommy just staring at the golden apples
99
This was posted 4 days before technoblade died
*"How many times did you watch this?"*  *"Yes."*
This line is from Brooklyn 99
Where is the audio,from
😮
Why is he so hostile 🥲
IS THAT THE CLIP FROM BROOKLYN 99 WITH PERALTA AND AND TERRY-
Techno in a dad shirt
How Wilbur+Tommy making promises: *Very quite*    How Techoblade+Tommy makes promises:
This kinda sounds like him lol And I miss him a lot :(
“No it’s like holding a couple of grapes” that is the most beautiful thing and the fact that techno said it. That was beautiful.
Technoblade never dies!
Is no one going to talk about how muscular Techno is?
Tommy: Damn Techno: Bruh Tommy: Phill hellpppp Phil: wtf???? Techno put Tommy down Techno: okay *grabs axe* Tommy: *just screaming* Phil: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!
techno: agressive towards tommy Tommy:do I weigh anything to you         like mf dont  care bout anything else
This was so good. Gg
I forget what music the background tape is from so aggravating 😡😡😡😢😢😢😢
I love Brooklyn 99
Wait of tommy weighs like grapes.... is he a grape????????
I love your techno design!!!!!
FROM BROOKLYN NINE-NINE AYOOOOO AHHHHHH
what happened to his hair?
Am I the only one thinking about the fact tommy looks very much like a kitten when he got picked up?
What movie or show is this?
Wait how does he know Tommy is like grapes cuz if he held grapes they would be considerably lighter than tommy. Or maybe even have no weight at all to him-
When you are a fan of Brooklyn99 and dsmp too
tommy is 6 foot 2
I actually had to watch it back to see the transformation
I LOVE UR ART STYLE SM
Love it
Never have I ever loved a techno design this much.
XDD oh gosh that is o good
I whatch this the day that I found out about technoblad deaf and I did not watch him for like I now I feel bad
SUS
Hehe, I watched Brooklyn nine nine with my parents and found all the meme audios
HAHAHAH YES THIS WAS GOOD OMG LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Youtube flipping hates me OF COURSE IT RECCOMENDS ME THIS WHILE IM CRYING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT Also, amazing animation, I love it and the concept. The emotions are great and so are the transitions =] (Please no "techno never dies" or stuff like that, it just makes me and many others feel worse)
How did the hair disappear
Techno when he says a couple of grapes deserves a reward :)
why is he so short tho-
Oooh Techno in a tank top with scars along his arms, so cool!
Good god that is so cool.
0:02 Without Pink Hair, tan Skin, Ponytail and Pointy Ears he kinda looks like Edward from Full Metal Alchemist
WHAF WAS THE SOUND FROM
I LOVE THE DSMP WITH B99 AUDIOS SM LMAOOO
I like this form of Techno. From the Elvenlike Halforc to the Werepig form... Nice... I have always like the Halforc form where he uses a mask for combat and such. But this feels, more... Its like. Yeah, this is my face, but when its time...
rip technoblade 😔
Brooklen 99 wooooo
wait a minute why does techno have hair in the first bit (till 0:02) but then doesn't later (0:05 onwards)?
Wtf
Pov:  techno had cancer and tommy nown and then techno dint want to tell anybody so they kept the secrer
Netherite: "Do I even way anything to you?" Steve: "No it's like holding a couple of grapes."
My mans just wanted an apple
Rip technoblade
HOW DO YOU MAKE THEESE!1😠😡🤬
Techno never die
“Ethan : DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!?! “  “Me: this got very physical very quickly” “Me: do I even weigh anything to you?” “Ethan: No, it’s like holding a couple of grapes” “Me: kicks around in the air* STOPpPpP ITTttT 😠😡”
Technoblade forever 😔👋💐

I was confused on why he said "couple of 🍇"  OwO is right okay PFFTTT🤣
Poor techno rip
How does he transform?
Techoblade died affter caner r.i.p
Brooklyn quote
I Am From The Future... R.I.P Technoblade
The potatoes look delicious
lmao I accidentally had Brooklyn nine-nine playing in the background on a scene with Jake and Terry so it really confused me for a second. great animation!
So I’m not in the Dream SMP fandom at all (my condolences to everyone who is though, with Techno, he seemed like a cool guy), but I just wanted to say that this entire animation is really satisfying to watch, same with your other works. It’s simple yet smooth and detailed, and I just wanted to pop in to say major props to you, dude, keep it up 👍
Rip technoblad
Tommy Just Wants A Apple
I love how Techno’s end expression is like “:{ sorry, tommy” But Tommy’s end expression is just “>:/“
Like holding a couple of grapes lol
“You’re so strong.” Lmao
Love your videos you need to make more often
Bruh os this voice from Brooklyn 99
0:09  techno's secret is Tommy weighs NOTHING, just NOTHING to him.
I miss him
techno died of gulping
whats the og audio?
Tommy: do I even weigh anything to you? Techno: no, it’s like holding a couple of grapes 🍇  Me: 😂😂😂😂
I hope you know Tommy watched this video you can see it in his stream when he was watching videos <3
BROOKLIN 99 voice
Technoblade would say this
Rip techno love you....
This is so awsome
I love this blended human/animal design (anthro) of Technoblade so much
Headcanon: People think the Human Techno and the pig hybrid Techno are too separate people. One is a farmer that just has hordes apon hordes of animals. The other is a terrifying immortal pig god.
Wow TECHNO is literally a mutant pig with 10000000 strength I'm not surprised he's also a legend in minecraft not take legend (real legend).
Tommy has seen your video!!
I can’t stop watching
Do YOU?!?
What they said is from Brooklyn nine nine
“no, it's like holding a couple of grapes.” is probably the nicest thing techno would say to Tommy lol
The talking is from Brooklyn nine nine
Like holding a coupel of grapes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
RIP MAN
Wait how did he know how heavy is a couple of grapes? If Tommy is already way more heavier than a couple of grapes. Wouldn't a grape for him be like a piece of paper or air to him?
What’s the secret is he a furry or he turns into a pig btw rip we miss you
"No it's like holding a couple of grapes " lolllll
Hahahaha
There is a mistake in your video when he was holding the person his hair was gone
R.I.p technoblade
a Loreis tic and canon in d smp
omg I will pay you money for art of these Techno designs to use for my Techno inspired DnD character. They're just... they're perfect. Take my money, I need this to live. I need this for my Welsh Beasthide Shifter that will be literally unkillable when he gets his Rune Knight subclass at level three. This is not a joke.
rip techno blade
rip techno s legend
That’s sound it’s from Brooklyn Nine Nine when Terry is talking to Jake Peralta I think
its funny and is technobade Terry crews?
Yh
Wait where is this from? I recognize it but can’t put my finger on it
Techno's dead😞
Rip techno 🥺
R.I.P techno 😭👌
I've heard that line before but drom where
Techno im sorry but my innards are telling me to simp. i am sorry everyone

Techno Never Dies!!
This is amazing and I love it!! Also the audio sounds familiar and I was trying very hard to figure out where I've heard this. Is this Final Space? Gary and Avocato?
"no its like holding a couple of grapes"

Little did this person know that four days after this video was posted…
Rip technoblade legends never die

Ok but Jake and terry really fit this as the audio
This audio is from Brooklyn 99 on Netflix
Chill technoblade  he just wanted and apple
I like how Tommy look mad when Techno said no 😂😂😂❤️👑
I had to rewatch it so many times I just love this animation!
Rip techno..

Such an amazing animation dude! And I like that you referenced one of my favourite shows (Brooklyn nine nine) Techno would have been proud of you if he watched it.... Rest in peace , Legend!
this gives me george (as tommy) and dream and dreamXD vibes lmao. overall, i love how smooth the lines are. Great job <3
Techno: Wow, I did not need to do this…
This is the best depiction of techno in casual wear I've ever seen

I heard the news. For the Technoblade fandom as well as DreamSMP fandom, I want to apologize to everybody for their loss. He died so young. I feel terrible and I really hope you all find happiness someday and somewhere, and find somebody who makes your days and nights 100% amazing and enjoyable just like the King you all loved.  If you can’t find someone like him, start a channel and use all of your creativity and inspiration from him and grow and become somebody as amazing and inspirational as he was. He loves you all <3
That form of Techno is very interesting, good job!  RIP TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES

buff techno is something I didn’t know I needed.
If you are planning on doing something (animation, art) in honor of Techno, may i suggest the song Game On from the movie pixels? Whenever i listen to it, i think of him
Welp FUCK CANCER, taking the life of one of the nicest person to exist,R.I.P technoblade,you can now kill the dead orphans and fight/destroy Satan   Rest in peace technoblade 🐷 🗡️👑
Rest well player, because you played well. You played with your heart and soul, and for that words can not express my gratitude.   Goodbye Techno

Rest in peace, techno
Rip Techno, a legend.
I watched this a few days ago before the news and know YouTube sent it my way again. this is heartbreaking. rest in peace Technoblade. you really inspired so many!
Rip 07
Absolutely excellent! I particularly like how Techno’s transformation is done off camera and how it zooms out to reveal the difference between them!  On a side note, I’m studying to get a career in animation myself and this perfectly lined up with a storyboard I’ve been doing with some of my characters!

Very smooth and quite funny ^^
Sadly techno isn’t here anymore …
This is a remake of something from Brooklyn 99
A lone, cloaked figure arrives at the Gates of Heaven. Saint Paul stared at him, his voice trembling, and asked:  "What is your purpose here?"  The figure glanced up at the Saint with a smirk. "I want a bell."  Saint Paul obliges, presenting a large golden bell to the cloaked individual, before running off as fast as his centuries-old attire would allow him. The figure leans back, winds up his fist, and punches the bell with all his might.  The sound echoed through the universe.  Another figure broke through the clouds. This one was wearing a green-and white striped bucket hat and had black wings. "Hey mate. Nice to see you again."  The unnamed individual grinned. "Hello, Philza. Did you bring the rest?"  Philza returned the smile. From behind him, two more emerged. One was a young adult wearing a yellow sweater, and was armed with a guitar. The other, clearly a child, had a red-and-white t-shirt and was equipped with an iconic pistol.  That wasn't all. Next to the child, there was another - this one with a green shirt, carrying a beehive.  Philza drew his bow, pre-nocked with 4 arrows. "Is this enough for you, Techno?"  Techno's response was as monotone as can be. "Where are the rest?"  One cue, a hole in the clouds appeared, filled with green light. A group of six appeared; each with a defining feature. One had goggles, another a headband. The third had horns and night-black skin. The fourth had claws and a tail, and the fifth had green skin and golden armour. The group was led by a man in a white mask.  Behind them, more emerged. A tall figure surrounded by purple wisps of smoke, a girl with pink hair, and a... guy in a sonic onesie? A girl with horns and a pirate outfit appeared, wielding a cutlass and riding a familiar, armoured horse. Techno grinned.  "Carl!" He nodded at the pirate. "Puffy."  Puffy waved, a confident smile on her face. Following her was a man in a blue top and beanie, a furry, a slimy guy with a punny shirt on, and a giant with glowing green eyes, a shark on his head.  Everyone Techno knew had heard the bell, and responded. A figure in a crown and a bi-coloured cape emerged, followed by an entire army of millions, chanting motivational war cries such as "Blood for the Blood God!", "Crab Rave!", "Late!" and "E!"  The figure in the crown whistled. A horde of wolves showed up, rallying to Techno's side. And of course...  "Steve!"  The polar bear roared in delight at seeing his old friend.  "Are we doing this or what?" The child asked.  "Tommy, shut up. You're ruining the atmosphere."  "I'M NOT RUINING THE ATMOSPHERE!" Tommy yelled. "If anything, YOU'RE ruining the atmosphere with that stupid haircut, and that face of yours, Wilbur, and-"  Philza sighed. "Just like old times, 'ey Techno?"  "Just like old times." Techno agreed. "Now... we've got a government to topple."  And he pushed open the Gates of Heaven.
:/
This makes me so sad every time I rewatch this, because of what happened. Cry.
Rest In Peace techno.

I just saw it again after the Viedeo and it hits different now...💔  O7 R.i.p 😭❤🕊
what the hell  did i just click on
I will fuck cancer up
Rest in peace
Warning in case of trigger: Mention of cancer    For a second I thought he was back, but we lost this legend to the battle of cancer.  It was so surreal to me, as id it was a joke for content, but then it set it. I couldn't and still can't believe, he passed away at the age of 23 and didn't even get to live to his fullest.  It was too sudden and too soon, but Techno will forever live in our hearts and all videos, clips, tweets, memes and animations of him will keep him alive.  He was a great content creator and always did his best to make us laugh or bring a smile to our faces. The joy of creating those videos gave us moments to remember and he will never be forgotten.  Technoblade never dies.
This hits pretty differently now..
I miss him rip techno
RIP Techno. A legend has died, but he will live on forever in our hearts.
I’m gonna miss the guy
Damn this hits different
I keep rewatching this

RIP Here lies the legacy of the greatest man ever to walk the code of Minecraft, abusing the loopholes and taking down the gods and demons one at a time. He was a great man. So young. If he was able to live this life without regret, we shall see him on the throne of God.

Dang, I miss him already.
Shit dude. I saw this animation the day after it came out, then techo dies a few days later.
...technoblade just died 💔 😭 Go watch the video technoblade's father just posted on his channel  Just a heads up 😞
Rest in peace Technoblade.
Techno blade has passed sadly, seeing this video made me sad 😭
:( watching this after technoblades death.. Rip. Thank u for making this. Makes me feel slightly better ab this loss.
I still can't believe he dead
Tbh this videos good but rip technoblade :((🕊🕊🕊
do i have some unfortunate news for you😞
this is so heartbreaking to see after he died 😭
I saw this and it made me excited for what you would do in the future, the future tommy and techno lore, and if Techno thought your unique take on human vs pig techno would be cool.  And 4 days later my sibling comes in bawling their eyes out saying he's gone.  And here we are, looking back on our metaphorical Skyblock world and all our experiences and memories together much sooner than we would have hoped.  Technoblade never dies in our hearts.
Keep his memory alive.
#riptechno
R.I.P techno we will miss you♥️
Absolutely beautiful! R.I.P Technoblade. You will be missed by all…
rest easy
This really makes me smile after the news, thank you
Rest peacefully techno :<

Rest in peace techno

Fly high king
well this now is, oh gosh  great animation, come by it a few times it's always as great and i replay it a few times because the talent is amazing
Rip Techno
fly high techno
Watching this after the most recent video is breaking my heart
rip technoo
I haven’t seen any animatic content at all recently and of course this is on my recommended right after techno dies
Is the secret that he's dead
rest in peace Techoblade ❤️❤️❤️
Watching this now hurts my heart. Most devastating news I have gotten in so long. Rest in peace techno : ( 💗
I feel like this was a sign that techno was going to upload soon, I just wasn’t ready for what that vid would have. RIP techno, hopefully he saw this, cuz this is amazing
Rip techno
He passed away. I'm shaking.
rip techno..we'll miss ya buddy
I love you techno. I miss you
that was oddly adorable
Techno sound like thor
My god why is it that I want to hug them both?
WHY DOES THIS FIT SO WELL!!
i just have to say, this audio fits perfectly. the show that this audio is from is so amazing too-
wereboar techno??
I love that your take on technoblade shifts between human and pig forms instead of being one or the other! Really cool stuff, wouldn't have ever thought of that honestly!
Tommy sounds like Jessey from Minecraft story mode
It's Amazing that the voice of Jake peralta and Terry Jeffers (Brooklyn 99) fit so well with Tommy and  Technoblade and I really want to hear the rest of the cast voices to be in dream smp characters.
ik that techno has said he prefers to be drawn as a pig instead of a human with pig attributes and i think the transformation power is epic
is this from the movie
Tell me if I’m wrong… but….       Terry likes grapes (Brooklyn 99)
THE WAY THIS IS A BROOKLYN NINE-NINE CLIP LMAO
Ryan renolds?
Hhh
So his secret is that he has a barrel full of golden apples?
I have watched this so ,any times I love it so much
This is sick
GAYYYY
The fact Techno lowered Tommy when he explained how light he is gave me some major mood-swing vibes,one minute he’s a hulking powerhouse,then he just calms down immediately.
What is this from
me for some reason immidiately being able to tell its from brooklyn 99
Great animation but like, there has to be a source for the joke but its not in the description. The B99 one is linked but not the vid for the og material
MK BUT GRAPES THO 🍇
Not once did I think Brooklyn 99 and the dream smp would be thing
I think the secret is his hair is fake. Since it's gon when he ran into tommy possibly dropping it
i guess technos a furry
What’s the audio from?
Unrelated but I like the use of a top tier Terry and Jake interaction.
That’s from Brooklyn nine nine lol
Hehe teco strok
Cringe
I love this.
When techno shut the door he has his hair but when he lift tommy it disapear🤣🤣😂😂
Hahahahhahah 69K nice
God I love this. It's do fricken funny
Lol I can see this happening
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
How I treat my brother when I know he bout to snitch
🤣🤣 In my mind the (secret) is that techno has a tail 🤣🤣
It’s cute the way Tommy say yeah to techno so quietly
omg i just wanted to say that I love all of your videos and your art is amazing <33
It actually took me three replays of this for me to realize he changes from a human into a pig halfway through.
Wait is the secret he can transform or???
Tommy:"do i even weigh anything to you?" Techno:"no its like holding a couple of grapes" This is me and my bff, like, SHE BE A PAPERS WEIGHT so i can basically spin her round cuz she like half my weight but shes older by about 6 months! But she my bff, so i say its cute in a FRIENDSHIP kinda way
Ayo? A version of technoblade (in fan-content) that shapeshifts?! Love that 💖
I seen this on tik tok
That's cool ^^ nice editing
THE TINIEST NOD THE LITTLE SMILE THIS I LOVE THIS SO SO MUCH
TALL TECHNOBLADE BEST TECHNOBLADE
Ааа, анімація супер
I love it
Voice
That void over is from Brooklyn nine nine the Netflix series
**wheezing intensifies**
I like the concept of Techno turning into a humanoid and intimidating Pig when he gets mad or he needs more power
BROOKLYN NINE NINE
Watching this,it makes me wonder if Techno grew a bit taller or if he was always that tall and just transformed into that powerhouse of a form.plus I also wonder that had he put Tommy down,how tall would he be completely.
Werepig!!
I don't know or care about the Dream SNP but this animation is gorgeous and fits great with the audio. Good job.
I love the idea that techno turns into a big pig instead of just strictly being either-or!
I like how techno had to be specific on how many grapes Tommy weighed to him
Tommy reaching out to grab the gapples was so accurate. When he moved in with him he just stole Technos gapples and I ate them as if they were nothing
Brooklyn 99
I could never get over how smooth your animations are
Cringe
This is so cool!
Is this line from brooklyn 99?
As a gay furry, let me tell you that techno in this is looking DAMN FINE 😳🥵
Okay is this from hunchback of Notre dame or from Brooklyn 99🤣 also absolutely amazing job
Sargeant Jeffords voice really suits technoblade
If Tommy is Jake Peralta, Techno is Terry Jeffords, then Philza Minecraft would be Captain Holt
Omfg I’m not the only one who has the idea of techno having a human and piglin form
"Holding a couple of grapes" Beautiful line
YES more people need to animate Brooklyn-Nine-Nine clips it’s always amazing
Gary from finale space work so well a tommy
I can’t stop watching this
Tecnoblade 🫣😳
IMAO
Hey yo so I was really inspired by your animation and your art style and I wanted to do some art practice, I usually post my practice on my instagram (I always give full credit to the artist’s tiktok and insta if I can find it) and its a drawing edit of one of the frames of the animation. I was wanting to you know if you were comfortable with me posting my practice? It’s totally fine if you’re not I just wanted to know beforehand (^v^ )
Perfect, loved it!
Cringe
Wat da hel
Lol I’m dying of laughter xD because I can just see this being supper accurate lol
how did i get to stupid dream smp animations, i was watching how to make bratwursts
I actually headcanon that Tommy was carried a lot by Techno during the time he spent with him for three reasons. 1: He got tired very very quickly in the cold. 2: Tommy has a lower then average body temp and Techno has a higher then average. Sitting on Techno's shoulder and holding onto him helped him get warm quicker. 3: Tommy would have random dizzy spells due to exile not getting enough food and nutrients. This made it so his vitamins and such were all very low so his strength was also low
Love story
Adding this to my favourites playlist Such smooth animation...must obtain skill..
<3
I love this show sm, it’s so nice when I see an animatic with it
brilliant animation
aaaa that transformation is such a cool idea i never thought of him shifting like that 😍 i love this audio and this art 🥰
I LOVE the idea of Techno being able to shapeshift! It’s such an interesting concept and I wish more people would use it.
*Chefs kiss* beautiful!
the crossover we never knew we needed
damn I love furry animations
Hey, I like this animation! I like your artsyle, too.
I know that she knows from Brooklyn Nine-Nine but Seeing it in Dsmp Style is better
grapes :)
Is this audio from Brooklyn 99? Because if it is, it's a crossover I never knew I needed.
love the Brooklyn nine-nine referance
*this is* The 14th time I’ve watched this  Edit: now it just makes me sad…
You're so talented.
Why's Techno hot  Cool animation btw
I love it so so much! 🥰
Brothers 🥰
Techno, The guy who can hold a boulder. Tommy, The guy who weigh's 2 pebble's.
I will never. Forgive myself. For this turning me on.
I wonder how many he can cary in a bag?
the concept of the diferent forms is real cool, Ive never seen that before
tommy’s “yeah” i will perish
Tommy's face after what Technoblade said to him: B*tch, wtf-  AHAHSJO i'm sorry, sometimes I go to the phase when I talk sh-t
I like that you put dark under Tommy's eyes because this is set at the end of the exile arc. Cool detail!
I re watched this 5-6 times ,you are so talented
Wait... IS THIS FROM BROOKLIN 99??
The secret/a hc of mine: Tommy found a barrel hidden under the house where Techno kept his poems.  Techno found out
ate
Ah Brooklyn 99
Can we just appreciate Techno’s design 😌👏🙏
I LOVE THESE ANIMATIONS! They are so smooth and beautifully colored. Keep up the amazing work! I look forward to your posts everyday!
The fact ,that Techno can turn into a Pigman ,is just hilarious.
golden apple
I love this! And seeing 2 Technoblade designs. Amazing.
OH THIS IS FANTASTIC
This...this is *Terribly awesome*  Edit: Im back and... its sad that Technoblade has died. I tried so hard to not cry. Anytime i see this vid i always tear up. It just reminds me of Techno.
Techno’s origin be like:                (I’m referring to the origin smp)
Terry Crewwsss!!!
Why techo look spicey huh 🤔 👀👀👀
Hello! I'm Techno pig and this is little brother Tommy and this is Dadza and i have no mama
Techno looks actually hot bro
lol
why is this Brooklyn 99 audio of Terry and Jake
I’m so blind that I had to watch the video 4 times to realise that techno changes from human form to piglin form 🤦‍♀️
This is so cool!!  Techno and Tommy's design is amazing!! They would act like that 😂🤣 I love this it's Incredible!!😆
me showing my secret food stash to my siblings:
lol
This is perfect ahahahha
Everytime you post a new video I get so happy. Seeing little shorts like these are something that helps me get rid of my anxieties. Thank you for doing this and please keep up the amazing work :D
I love this <3 XDDD
i like the idea of techno's character design as a wereboar u can tell when in the begaining he looks more normal then he suddenly has more hog like features
M
This is adorable and so well animated! Your animations provide a healthy dose of serotonin 🌺✨
zoan devil fruit
Man i wish i could be held like a couple of grapes
Hear me out ((NOT PIG TECHNO-- HUMAN TECHNO))
Your art style is everything 😭💛
I love it 😆I love it so much
i love your art sm!!
canon
I love the detail that he's scars stretched out when he got bigger! I would've never thought of that but it makes so much sense
His secret is that he likes morbius
Where did you find this sound?
is that the ROCK
tommy:grapes
THIS IS SO GOOD OH WOW 💕💕💕
I love how you did this, my favorite thing is how the audio works for the animatic instead of the other way around it’s really well done and the technique you used to switch the emotion from serious two casual was very fluid and works really well with the characters and the drawling style and color palette it’s a hard transition to do, and seeing the visual of the audio for this transition is amazing.
TERRY AND JAKE AUDIO
If Tommy spills the info about Techno having a human form, I feel like Techno would deny everything then sic withers on it all for good measure
I love the callback to Tommy always eating technos golden apples when given the chance lol
This is so good! I love Techno’s pig form!!!
Dudee this is soo good, could you make like an animation of how this hapoends, i think it would be rlly funny XDD
I thought it would be the other way around. Where tommy found techno in his piglib form
"just like holding a couple of grapes"
hggghhhhhhhrrrrrrrr your techno desiiiggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn- It is glorious. Beautifully done, creator!
this reminds me of a fic i was reading literally like two hours ago. very similar except it was wilbur
Saw this on Tik Tok earlier 🤣🤣
Dream SMP animatic... FUCKING CRINGE
M-Might I has this new head cannon now? Like he only shows his human form with people he really trusts, like literally only Phil.
I was just watching Brooklyn 99 no way
Love the Brooklyn 99 quote usage
Ohhhhh my god I love this 🥰
YOO B99 TO DSMP LES GOO
Ahhh XD I love Brooklyn 9-9, and I wasn’t expecting this lol. You did an amazing job!
Ugh I keep rewatching this as it keeps coming through my feed. I’m O B S E S S E D
aets lakēæ hæœldïng a caæplaäle æf græpes
“How many times did you watch this?” Me: yes.    I read the description and I think that is a pretty fucking creative idea! I would’ve never thought of that. KEEP BEING AWESOME🗣‼️‼️
Where is the audio from
love this!!
I love technos disine
Technoblade is now a werepig. *nice.*
Brooklyn 99
It's always so cool to see how your art and animation improves with each upload
Omg it took until my third watch through to even realize techno shifts forms hahahahah! Absolutely wonderful detail!!!
Your animations and colors always make wanna draw, also I love the size difference sm big boi techno
TECHNO PIGLIN SHIFT!!!! This is so cool I admire your animation style so much!
I just saw this on tiktok! :D
I like the idea of technoblade being able to transform it adds alot
I genuinely get so excited every time I see that you've posted something, you're my favorite artist on al the platforms I'm on :D
"It's like holding a couple of grapes"  I want to send that with no context to my friend.
Where did u get the audio? Is it from a movie?🍿🤩😍

TERRY IS GONNA DIE SAVING A PRESIDENT OR TERRY IS NEVER GONNA DIE!!
I really enjoy how he's "calm" and more human then angry more pig
Bro I love the animation- and your art style!! It all brings a certain FEELING that I love keep up the amazing work! You rock!💞💞
This was soo cool and funny good job also I love how you draw techno
DUE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, thats not technoblade. Thats a mutant. Technoblade is canonically 3 years old
Dam techno be going to the gym
I like how hard it is to notice that Techno went through a human-pig transformation. We're so familiar with various artists giving him some variation of each body type that both feel natural. Long, pink-haired anime protagonist? Techno! Enormous anthropomorphic pig? Techno! Just some guy with glasses and a brown jacket that isn't recognizable as Wilbur? Techno!
Since tommy was standing next to the basket of apples, we can compare that height to Techno's form and tommy would only reach his belly at most. Making Techno in that form almost twice his height, damn he's big.
I'm like imaging this scene after c!Dream's visit and c!Tommy was hiding from him on the SMP
I like the blue hue for Technoblade transformation
banger vid as always :D
tommy: what about ranboo techno: ..... *meh* timmy: I am    g r a p e
:]]
wait where is this adio from?
Why is technoblade drawn as a giant warthog
Tommy learns techno likes children
Techno 😳
Omg I love the idea that Techno can shift between a more human and more piglike form…it’s so clever! I always would draw it as a mask but that’s only Cus I’m bad at symmetry in faces 😂.
Love the designs
0:07 is like me and my friend! (techno would be my friend and tommy would be me)
I like this one good transition two because it’s funny
Yeet
I don’t watch the dream smp, but your art style and choice of audio is perfect
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!! SUCH SMOOTH ANIMATION AND GREAT COMPOSITION AND COLOURS AND EXPRESSIONS, JUST WOAH!!! :O
Geez techno pig form is that tall?
Imagine Techno Carrying everybody next-
LOVE THIS
this is immaculate ✨
The idea to merge anime techno and hog techno into one as a transformation is something that needs to be done more
I fucking love your techno design
Love your animations! Can we see more Ranboo?
This is perfect. I wish this was an actual thing that happened in Exile, it feels so in character. Also love how Tommy’s eyes look.
how many times did you watch this?  me: yes
It would be less than grapes lmao
his weeve came off
I just ✨LOVE ✨the way techno transformed into the pig/piglin form, I never thought about it that way but it’s so dang cool!!
I feel like I’ve never seen their full techno design, I love him
I like the detail of Tommy reaching for the apples lol
this is incredible
This is awesome
Love that Tommy curls his arms and legs up like a kitten being carried
i really like the movement! its somthing i apsolutly ador how you do in your animations
Love it
I just want to say I love your animations so much!
The little details like Tommy’s eyes darting back to the apples are just- AAA
This is absolutely beautiful. Every artist goes through a phase where they hate their art and even if you are going through that phase, you shouldn’t. The expressions, the coloring, everything is absolutely beautiful. It’s breathtaking seeing your work and I know this comment won’t be noticed but you really are a huge inspiration to me and others. You can see every emotion and it’s beautiful- I would love to see the Eggpire in your style! Because that’s more emotional pain than physical in terms of the SMP. I would love to see the designs and care being put into the videos
Tommy just wanted the shiny gapple XD
I’m embarrassed by how many times I have watched this— it’s so smooth!! Amazing video as always :D
The subtitles make it 10x better lol
𝕎𝕙𝕖𝕟 𝕕𝕚𝕕 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕘𝕖𝕥 𝕤𝕠 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍𝔀𝓸𝔀
ahh you're back!! :D
It's so beautiful!

THE TURN AROUND.... feels so three dimensional and REALLLL
SHAPE SHIFTER TECHNO SUPREMACY
YEAHH
oh my god these designs are awesome :D love the colours and the movement is so smooth
Can someone pls explain the lore of these characters I've been in the dark for so long I've gone blind
WOAH THIS IS SO CLEAN AND AMAZINGGGGGG
I broke the replay button already : (
Ghu
LMAOOOO THIS IS SO GREAT
this was so well done!
PLS HE LOOKS SO TINY NEXT TO TECHNO <3 💀
TALL PIGLIN TECHNOBLADE SUPREMACY YESSSS
I enjoy your animations so much!! So smooth and amazing!!! 🤩
Why the hell techno always looks so  hot
Tommy’s sudden wanting to grab the apples as techno ramps up is like him saying “ig it’s now or never” until techno grabs him
IT. IS. SO. _SMOOOOOOOOOTH_ I'm in love with the art style and the audio and the animation and just YES. YESSS.
This fits so good to two of my carackters
This is amazing and it explains the to different ways techno is shown in fan art!
I love techno blades look  tho even if he's in pig form but also ITS A SECRET TOMMY YOU GOTTA SHHHHH
Love your techno designs!
Tommy is being held by the scruff of the neck like a kitten... I can't get rid of this thought
YEEEES I love this so much 😩beautiful technoblade crumbs.
Dsmp lore vs reality be like:
*OMG YOUR TECHNO DESIGN IS AMAZING, I’VE ALWAYS LOVED THE IDEA OF HIM BEING A SHAPESHIFTER BECAUSE YOU GET THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!!!!!*  🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
the b99 audio is perfect, Tommy totally gives me jake peralta vibes
your animation is improving in leaps and bounds and it's amazing
lol turn on captions they’re pretty funny XD
I like the detail that when Techno is in human form the scars look normal cut ones but when he turns into his buff piglin form the scars look like they're stretched out slightly
I love how smooth the animation is! I also love how the audio is from Brooklyn 99 👀❤️
Cool techno design!
Already watched this three times in a row XD what a perfect animation!
<3 <3
From the thumbnail I thought this was gonna be serious and slightly scary, but now I've got a taste of my own medicine with that Double Life prank I did. Thank you for disciplining me.
Emejzing 🤩
Ok we all know that technoblade called an emergency family meeting after he realized that Tommy was starving and needed help
Their designs are so cool!
OMG TECHNOBLADE REALLY MORBED HOLY SHIT
What’s wrong with me why cant I stop watching this
Tommy = Couple of grapes.
Pov:Techno regretting going physical cuz tommy barely had any weight at all
40 MINS EARLY
This audio is perfect!! I love your design for techno!
Very very awesome what can I say I love your videos
tommy vs techno fits the vibe of jake vs terry so well except for the part where terry has never exterminated an entire third world country for calling him bald
That’s is awsome
I love it
I’ve watched this too many times! It’s so well made and smooth and i just love it oh god this is so cool
“Holding a couple of grapes”💀 lmao
Tbh, I love the idea of Techno shape shifting into human/animal form You’re the first animator whos done something like this, and it has me *hooked* >:DD Keep going with your amazing animations😁
That's adorable
i dont know if i see pity or realization, regret from techno's reaction-
I love this
This is really cute
Ooooo
OOOOOOOOO nice animation! also like techno's design there
Extra Nice ❤❤❤❤
Not me crying
You made him turn into a pig at will?! *furiously scribbles notes for wereboar fighter D&D character*
Eyo why human Techno be lookin like Edward Elric
I love how he transformed into a pig
Tommy: "Do...Do I weight anything to you?" Techno: "Nah, you're pretty light for a child" Tommy: "Rude..."
This brings me more joy than I can articulate
I love how you made him into a real pig. That's adorable. Poggers.
Early but there’s still 10k views what!!!
Hey I’m early
👏aplausos por otra obra de arte
Honestly wouldn’t mind being held like a couple of grapes
We love Brooklyn 9-9 sounds🙏🙏 bro but how you do that-
This is damn smooth man-
"How many times have you watched this" Me: "yes"
This looks awesome!
hey its 2 things i like Dreamsmp and Booklyn Nine-Nine
I love the subtle transformation of Techno’s pig form, the design is unique yet still recognizable as one character — I think you really nailed their dynamic in this <33
This is literally my headcanon!!!
OKAY 😟❤
later: *whispers* what is the secret Tommy? You can tell m- *dies*
Appl
Genuinely thought this was a continuation to 'Hey Techno, wanna hear a secret?" and wanted to hear Techno go all Santa doesn't exist to Tommy Edit: Rest in piece big man, we love you. I learnt about his passing from your replies, and I still can't keep myself together when I think of him, he impacted me and so many others,  I hope all of you are coping well, remember to stay hydrated, o7 ♥️
I KNEW it was from Brooklyn Nine-Nine!
This fits so well!
I love the techno designs!! And the audio fits very well lol
Oh my gosh, I love the little story here.  The animation is fantastic!
I like that Techno’s expression softens as he starts to put Tommy down, like upon acknowledging that Tommy barely even weighs anything to him he regrets having gotten physical.  Edit: I meant this as like, ‘Techno remembers that he’s much much stronger than Tommy and doesn’t actually want to hurt him’, not ‘Tommy is skinny and starving so Techno regrets telling him off’
I SAW THAT SOUNDS BUT WITH TUBBO ANF RANBOO😭, AWESOME VID
I really like this design from him but I imagine him a little bit more fluffy
XD
Accurate
Don’t care sorry
lmaoo mans just wanted an apple-
Tommy was scruffed like a kitten
First of all, the voices are just, chefs kiss, second of all, hoLY- never thought of seeing techno and Tommy’s size difference like this 😨
The way you draw techno is amazing 😭
I love your Techno design so much!! And isn’t Tommy like 6’3 holy-
I LOVE the idea that techno turns into a pig when he is angry!! Or maby  whenever he wants lol  But anyways I love this!!
Æ
Poor Tommy wants to be at LEAST a couple of rocks
your technoblade is adorable oh my gosh
Wow the Techno design looks great ✨ Lil tommy compared to Techno 😆
