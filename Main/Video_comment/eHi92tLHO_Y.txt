STEVIE G.O.D!!!
I'm an english student,my listening is more american than uk
I never hear a word he says....i just sit and look at him lol
We must win the Cup. Sod Celtic. Hahaha.
Steven gerrard has done really well at rangers I think he will be as good a manager as he was a player he is top class Lee Hambleton from Sheffield
💚💚💚🤍🤍🤍🤍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Our manager is absolutely class. We are the best team in Scotland. Never in doubt.
The man the legend
10 year deal then give him my job 🧐 Whenever Steven Gerrard Destroyer Of Celtic does go 🥺 He will go with EVERY BEARS thanks and gratitude for bringing out club BACK to where it belongs  55 and counting  No Surrender
Overhead kick at 36 💪🏻😎
Im so proud to call him our gaffer what a guy
Yeah, the best team in Scotland really taught us a lesson HAHAHAHAHA WATP 55, count them
Celtic - AC Sparta Prague 1:4, AC Sparta Prague - Celtic 4:1, SK Slavia Prague - Rangers Butchers 1:1, Rangers Butchers - SK Slavia Prague 0:2. Im so proud of our Czech clubs!!! You are not rivals for us.
Who's the best team in Scotland ?
Damn I really thought the best team in Scotland would win but by the first whistle they bottled it as usual  55 Fail Fail 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Just another win against the “best team” in Scotland 😂 made them look very average now let’s get the job done this year gers 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Easy
Steven Davis outstanding said it all season hes the key to our success gonnae be a sad day when he hangs up his boots some people fail to see just how good he is at times.
Rangers players are re-signing for the club and Celtic players are heading for the door. Says it all.
God
THE GAFFER !!!
Well done the Bear's after 15 minutes the result was never in doubt !! Wee are the best team in Scotland without a doubt

Shagger, You just don’t stop shagging 😃💙
🇬🇧
I can’t help but think that this could easily have been a treble winning season. Maybe next year ❤️🤍💙
They had a few lapses, but if they keep the intensity like today they’ll be lifting the cup
Well done Rangers and SG !
They  realy are good
Shota Arveladze from GEORGIA. Congratulations
Terrific performance and result today! Steve Clarke is off his rocker if he doesn't put Patterson in the Euros squad!!  Love this interview with our world class gaffer..always do love hearing him speak. WATP 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⚽️🏆
Our God of Glasgow has taken to where we wanted to be and now deserve to be for that Sir a big thank you from everyone of us, but just shows WE ARE THE PEOPLE AND HE IS NOW .
How much do we love the man in charge 💙
Stevie G gets the results as per usual 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Well done Rangers. Without question the best in Scotland. Great to see Rangers back where they belong 👍😁😁

Greasy hair
Celtics best player wouldn't even make our bench
Cup plz gaffer 👍🇬🇧
LEGEND
Patterson ran the show down the flank!
💙 *GE55ARD* 💙
Take a bow master Gerrard, ❤🤍💙
Superb result from the lads today, with two great goals and a Penalty save to keep a clean sheet.  A wee celebration now.....make mine a double 😃  55 🔴⚪🔵
Arfield was disappointing for me.  Kent was unplayable. Goldson looked a bit out of sorts. This is our season. Let’s get the double. Get a few strong players in over the summer and go for the treble 🔴⚪️💙
Best team in Scotland lost again hahaha
Better than all the rest 😁😁😁🇬🇧5️⃣5️⃣🇬🇧😁😁😁
English and a proud rangers supporter I'm in tears today
I absolutely LOVE THAT MAN for how he’s brought pride passion and belief back to not only us fans but our club. Stevie G your are a living legend in our eyes 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧

" trying to get them tied up" if theyve spent more than 2 years at the club in these times and still arent snatching that pen out your hand let them go and get max amount for them considering theyre " important" to the team and challenges ahead....?
Y do that keep saying that thay r the best team in Scotland when the troops a best in Britain it's not there foult that they r inter bread lol n s troops
So well spoken by our damn fine Manager.  Thanks Gentlemen at Rangers Football Club.
The gaffer ❤🤍💙🇬🇧🇬🇧
Tremendous performance, could easily have had more and defended brilliantly for most of the game. Another top result, now Rangers must look to use that mentality to take this into each game as we cannot afford to just throw it away, but I've every faith in the players achieving that. Tremendous result all thanks to our top manager!
Shagger
only one team in it today.
