Fivio Foreign 2 Slept on i sware my boy deserves his flowers 💐 while he here!
Definitely he has been going mad hard lately no lie he is one of my favorites that is alive
I think guy with the tea towel was a bit older
I fucks wit' FIVI!!! He has to be more aware of his features as he funny need them at all. A lot of my favorite songs are solo projects. My 5 year old says the letter "a" more than I did as a child but not as an adult. "Aye yo aye aye!!!
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷💪🏾

and some people say for me to be a rapeest why would somethings be said i say they set me up n the way they carry it - it makes sense every one is trying to remember what was said we wher 10 or 9 or 11
him before when he was not bio at the time he said yes it did then dude said this and that about him getting raped but he never told anyone that because it was imberringsing how did he kno that and more unless he was there and if he was there he is his cousin why didnt he help him
before i do it one dude says i raped him but he put me in him that is not what raped him i am not circumsized but when he got raped it was a circumsized one so he was smokeing and he past out woke up and one was in him i asked him did it not feel like it was in
niggas keep giving deatails about how they kno i am a rappest i tell everyone it is a act and they kno deatails to well everyone says that is how it comes off how could kno this and that if they was not there and how do they kno what i am going to do
aye for the record the only reason why i was stoping you from snitching on them dudes is because they are some of the ones that hypnotized me i am going to get them to un do it
O
This is a mf masterpiece 🔥🔥
Long Live TDot! 🕺🏾♥️🙏🏾

Ecclesiasticus 13:1 He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled therewith; and he that hath fellowship with a proud man shall be like unto him. Ecclesiasticus 13:2 Burden not thyself above thy power while thou livest; and have no fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than thyself: for how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? for if the one be smitten against the other, it shall be broken. Ecclesiasticus 13:3 The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also. Ecclesiasticus 13:4 If thou be for his profit, he will use thee: but if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee. Ecclesiasticus 13:5 If thou have any thing, he will live with thee: yea, he will make thee bare, and will not be sorry for it. Ecclesiasticus 13:6 If he have need of thee, he will deceive thee, and smile upon thee, and put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and say, What wantest thou? Ecclesiasticus 13:7 And he will shame thee by his meats, until he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at the last he will laugh thee to scorn afterward, when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee. Ecclesiasticus 13:8 Beware that thou be not deceived and brought down in thy jollity. Ecclesiasticus 13:9 If thou be invited of a mighty man, withdraw thyself, and so much the more will he invite thee. Ecclesiasticus 13:10 Press thou not upon him, lest thou be put back; stand not far off, lest thou be forgotten. Ecclesiasticus 13:11 Affect not to be made equal unto him in talk, and believe not his many words: for with much communication will he tempt thee, and smiling upon thee will get out thy secrets: Ecclesiasticus 13:12 But cruelly he will lay up thy words, and will not spare to do thee hurt, and to put thee in prison. Ecclesiasticus 13:13 Observe, and take good heed, for thou walkest in peril of thy overthrowing: when thou hearest these things, awake in thy sleep. Ecclesiasticus 13:14 Love the Lord all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation. Ecclesiasticus 13:15 Every beast loveth his like, and every man loveth his neighbor. Ecclesiasticus 13:16 All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man will cleave to his like. Ecclesiasticus 13:17 What fellowship hath the wolf with the lamb? so the sinner with the godly. Ecclesiasticus 13:18 What agreement is there between the hyena and a dog? and what peace between the rich and the poor? Ecclesiasticus 13:19 As the wild ass is the lion's prey in the wilderness: so the rich eat up the poor. Ecclesiasticus 13:20 As the proud hate humility: so doth the rich abhor the poor. Ecclesiasticus 13:21 A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down is thrust away by his friends. Ecclesiasticus 13:22 When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped, and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place. Ecclesiasticus 13:23 When a rich man speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he saith, they extol it to the clouds: but if the poor man speak, they say, What fellow is this? and if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him. Ecclesiasticus 13:24 Riches are good unto him that hath no sin, and poverty is evil in the mouth of the ungodly. Ecclesiasticus 13:25 The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil: and a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance. Ecclesiasticus 13:26 A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity; and the finding out of parables is a wearisome labour of the mind.

My best song on the album I love him ❤️❤️
I think he knows how pop smoke died that's why t dot woo died
this is my fav joint of the album, pure fivio essence
10/10 album fsfs, much love fivio 🖤💯
Fivio I Love your music ! You should collaborate with Ferre Gola one of the greatest African artist ! Watch this video clip if you love good music : https://youtu.be/_2bbuDU74H4
No.
Who else sub consciousnesses tells them Pop was set up.
bankroll buna (fat Nigga dancing) being going crazy in the videos 😂
Fivio is underrated🔥👀
King of NY❄️🗽💙
masterpiece
NY dudes are everything  lol.
Don't you sell your soul!!!
This album is a huge disappointment. Your mix tape shit 100x better than this industry garbage. You sold your soul and pop smoke smoke killed to put out this garbage? You need to go read your BIBLE not name your trash album after one
This shit is weak they all sound the same.  Pop was the real king
Please protect Fivio at all cost. May Allah watch over you King 🤲🏿.

Taliban Bandz - Ahh Ha https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k-RpIQsrIwA
Let it be known to ALL today. That JESUS CHRIST is the ONLY way to HEAVEN, to receive ETERNAL LIFE. Salvation is found in NO OTHER (Acts 4:12). That means Religion cannot save you, your "good deeds" cannot save you, your religious figures cannot save you, your idols, and charms cannot save you. JESUS made it clear, that HE is the only way to HEAVEN (John 14:6) Dont believe the lie that people tell you that JESUS was "just a man" "just a prophet" He was MUCH MORE. you tell me which "man" or "prophet" rose from the DEAD?? you will never. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN!!!!! (John 3:3 1 Peter 1:23 1 John 5:1). The Bible says in PHILIPPIANS 2:10-11 that at the NAME of JESUS CHRIST EVERY KNEE WILL BOW and EVERY TONGUE WILL CONFESS THAT HE is LORD.  Do NOT reject the FREE gift of GOD, which is Eternal life and salvation through His SON JESUS. There is a place GOD has prepared for those who choose to REJECT his SON. and that place is where the devil and his angels will be TORMENTED forever in The LAKE OF FIRE/HELL, because it was prepared for them (Matthew 25:41) (Revelation 20:10) GOD didn't make HELL for you, but if you REJECT JESUS you will end up there.  "If you CONFESS with your MOUTH the LORD JESUS, and BELIEVE in your HEART that GOD has RAISED HIM from the dead, YE SHALL BE SAVED. - Romans 10:9
