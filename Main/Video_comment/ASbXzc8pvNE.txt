Am I the only person who’s here in 2025?
miss this
27
God I miss Ray Hudson.
Ese ferran como falla eh
Cathy sucks🤘🏼
Fc Barcelona forever
This was the match that set Barcelona back in motion
Gavi tho
I want to go ahead and point out Suarez’s respect for his previous club. He still doesn’t celebrate even after scoring on us. He just went for the ball and went straight back to play.
Watching matches in English is so boring 😴
segui soñando simeone,   hijo nuestro siempre seras...!!
we just beat real madrid 4:0 today
This is  amazing and I hope to see them back in champions league and win it next year as well,  I will not be surprised by looking at this game !
Yall might not realize but ter stegen , has made the biggest leap. Xavi told him everything starts with him . kinda like pep , it always started with the GK. So ter stegen really had to step up as a leader. I feel like thats why he gets really frustrated when they score or he feels he doesnt play to a certain standard
In my opinion xavi has to put traore on matchups he knows traore will win. He is physically and faster than most rw in la liga.
Focus on Dani Alves at 4:21, the passion and leadership 🔥🔥🔥
Dani alves goal remind me of Messi against Real Madrid (3-2)
That commentator pisses me off. Ruins it for me
The merciful description cephalometrically hop because reminder acly point behind a sassy romania. curved, terrible leaf
Seriously, Barcelona need a new GK.  TS just bleeds goals every second
L commentators
Barcelona Really changed when xavi took over
Barca Barca ay ay ola ola ola ola ola
Vamos Barca! Now that's how we play. Visca Barca! 🔵🔴
Commentator is horrendous
Were back dogs
It’s like being in love all over again❤️
Im at a loss for words at Adama Trore’s speed 😬😬😬
Jordi Alba, Goal of the Game! How many time over the years have his supporting runs  up and down the flanks lead to  goals...  he is a truly exceptional footballer... and then there's Alves on the other side!!! Wow!!!!
MIS MATCH! Lmfao
Yo. Not gonna lie, if this team works hard on building chemistry, we might just see Barça come to life again.
am i the only one cringing at the commentary?
First time in a while I've seen Barca hold on and just stop any chance of a comeback. Great stuff
It's Alba's celebration  for me 🤣🤣🤣
These American commentators are just…not good lol
That De Jong tackle seems red
Barca played great, they won but Pique doesn’t deserve to be starting at this point in life . I’m Madrid fan but I’m sure barca fans agree with me in this.
🤡
alves is the man of the match!
bru what is this commentary 💀
100% lucky win lol and I'm not an Atleti fan btw
That 4th Barca goal was beautiful!
You can tell Luis Suarez goal hurt him 🥺
El Cholo. Llegó a jugar con un esquema. Que pensó iba a jugar contra un barcelona debil. Pero no se esperaba el gran cambio de ritmos que le dieron.  El barca del estilo de guardiola ya no se vera. Pero ahorita se viene el estilo de xavi y es buenísimo y sorpresivo.  Ese barca que metia 3 y 4 y 5 y6  Lo van a volver a ver
Barca have a great game after months of being mediocre. kids: *OMG! BARCA IS BACK!!!!!!* LMAOOO
Dani Alves made Barca so much better
Dest should get sometime to play so he can get use to the new squad.
Commentators are dead boring.
Last goal was my inspiration!! 🤩 Barcelona
Commentators so weak 💩💩🗑
All this team is missing is Suarez back lol
They need to fire whoever tf that commentator is and never let him speak again
Yall see what just a single good player does  to the team
I sad about Luis Suarez for makes his goal goal against his old team look at this
They played well enough to give you hope. 😂
5:00 why does this look like a fifa celebeation animation
Like time stopped with Barcelona second goal, what a volley !
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God..  Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him............................
Barca GOGOGO
Alba really pulling Gavi's head back 🤣
Que bien!!!!   Me alegro por los Cules.  Ojala sigan por esa senda, lleguen mas patrocinadores, mas inversion, salgan de esos problemas financieros y no cometan los errores que los llevaron a esa crisis
Xavi has just started not even his first full season and has already gotten us back to 4th place
4 2 but rams has the football i am this thunder storm of warning nosnow and moon
STOP SPOILING THE RESULTS!!!!!!  IMCLUDE THE INTRO WALKOUTS AND TEAM SHEETS DONT BE LAZY
Xavi Is something Else
Barca fans are gonna talk about  this game for a minute “we coming back”
BARCELONA IS BACK!!!!!!!!
ALVES AND TRAORE NEED BARCA FIFA CARDS ASAP 😂😂
Though I am a madrid fan, I am so happy seeing Barca play so well again.
Imagine messi with this team 😢
cant remember last time I watched a soccer match but wow so much changed Suarez on athletico Madrid now??
Did anyone die of a vaccine heart attack?
Yo I didn’t kno it was athletico Madrid I thought it was Bilbao
The potential this team has let’s goooo
robbery
The fact they got scored on first and came back 💯 with koemen they would’ve just kept their heads down and probably lost the match
Commentary is trahs 1 guy sounds dead
Chelsea Handler got all of the vaccines and boosters and had a heart attack!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣zznsod
dani played amazing but man they have to get a replacement for pique. He is just not it for this team no more.
Pique needs to retire
Madrid deserved this loss.
Who cares about Barcelona now? Messi is gone...
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who (REPENT).    Just ask  (for the BLOOD of JESUS for FORGIVE your SINS).   And then PRAISE the Name of GOD!  And then ASK God for what you need help with.  It REALLY WORKS.
Who else saw Joao felix swing his arm at the ball like a volleyball from the corner at 4:35
In all fairness Atletico has a history of bending over to Barca. Everyone watching Barca ,but Atleti been just as bad. And it's not just this season either.
Why are their sooo many ads on this channels video
4:30 anyone else notice felix trying to do a hand of god like Maradona did? 😂
Compared to the way Barca played under Koeman , this was refreshing.
Best performance of the season so far.
Can't belive this is 2nd trending
Lmao atlético had a chance to wreck Barca too 😂🤦🤦
Farming has become quite prevalent in Spain.
I still feel like Luke De Jong has more value than Ferran Torres up top lowkey. He really has shown up frequently to score for Barça
Dang i didnt even know how stacked Barça was rn. They got Auba Ferran AND Traore?!?!?
Atleticos lack of defensive communication and Barcelonas pressure up high stood out to me the most
so happy bout this win especially all the turmoil were getting out of
Glad Ray Hudson is gone. Don't miss the screaming and the creepy obsession with "the fantastic, unfairly treated" Riqui Puig.
Westhill high
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 …Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13-15 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Man this is a very stimulating victory...hopefully is what barca needed to comeback stronger than ever!
B
Ohh
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
most impressive performance i have seen from us for a long time,well done well done
Wow! So glad to see Barca finally win…
I love the new look Barca
*barca sucks*
Knowing that dembele posses 5 start weak foot I would put him on the front to toy with Pierre aby and Adam tarore. I think Barca can build something now. I wasn’t impressed by fernando Torres. But just pressure if first game. Will see what this team will bring.
Pique literally plays like a chicken without a head!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
oblack  LOL
I can not stand the second commentator. I don’t know why ESPN still let him cover games
Athletico Madrid don’t have great form since last year simeone have to go out in others for the team to progress
yuhhh 💯
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
5:00 Looks like a video game!
can't stand Ale man. he is always negetive.
DOGEcoin and Shiba Inu are breaking out to the MOOn! 🚀🚀🚀
Just here for Dani Alves
not even a barca fan but i wanna see this team thrive again
ESPN before the game: Alves is so old what are they doing ESPN after the game: How was Alves not called for the Europa League, they’re crazy. Comments in function of the results.  FOH!
I am unbelievably happy to see Dani Alves and Adama on the right flank. Gavi and Araujo proving they are key to this team's success (RENEW THEM BOTH ASAP). Future looks bright
Suarez deserves a better team man
Simone needs to get fired … not a Madrid fan but is been there to long … to defensive
This is the final generation before the return of Jesus Christ. If you're willing, come to Jesus Christ before time comes to an end. The rapture is about to happen. The children of God are about to vanish from the earth. They will be taken to heaven to spend eternity with Jesus Christ. Those left behind will suffer during the Great Tribulation.  If you desire eternal life, reject the Covid-19 vaccine and seek Jesus Christ. We must be found worthy to escape the judgments coming upon the earth. We must be Holy and Righteous. Jesus Christ transforms the willing into His own image. They are the sons of God.   Jesus Christ didn't die in vain. It's not God's will that anyone perish but all repent to recieve eternal life. I desire to see many of you transformed into the image of Christ and all for His Glory. I desire to spend eternity with many of you as my family in Christ. It's your choice.  These are the End Times. Everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled. If you're willing, now is the time to repent and prepare for the return of the King. Do not be left behind during the rapture. The Great Tribulation will be unbearable.
The commentating is just awful.
Dani Alves still has it ❤️❤️
An average game by his standards, but Pedri is a joy to watch, especially in tight spaces. Some great combo work in the attacking third with Traore on the wing. Barca's ability to maintain possession deteriorated noticeably after he was taken off.
Can’t remember the last time Barca won a match as big as this, great game
5:00 that doesn’t look real
This is the greatest Barça match we’ve ever seen in AGES VISCA BARÇA ❤️💙
Looks like Barcelona is reviving. I am glad that my favorite PL player came back to my favorite team. Let’s go Traore -Barcelona.
This commentator gotta go
Thanks guys for awaken my love 💓 again for fcb. Love these team 💙 forever 💙
God loves you!
Turn to Jesus Christ now!
Its amazing to see my barca winning again 😭😭😭
Alba is a clown!
Soccer
Nobody: Commentator after every goal: “PoOr DeFeNdInG”
Finally they start to get their stuff together and bring in good players. I was skeptical of Alves but he had a great performance and so did the rest of the new players.
It’s all for show just to give the fans something
Well done Barcelona teams wins the match.
Please don't put the score in the title.
xavi was always the only one who was going to  be able to bring us back from the dead visca barça ❤️💙❤️
Can’t remember last time barcelona score 4 goals, I didn’t see the game but God we needed this one ,  can someone explain to me why adama traore was playing for an English  club that didn’t know how to use him my God what a different he was in that first game for barcelona
Wow Barcelona 4 2 goals atletico Madrid
God help us to get back ✌️✌️✌️
Dani albes .... Wow
the only thing that needs to improve now is the color commentary
best win of the season.
Your consistency and quality of content never disappoints!!
Atletico never miss! they’re always on time with the annual tradition of becoming an inconsistent mess lmao
Alves is a beautiful thing, I wish him the best and he is the GOAT in RB position by miles.
How was it a yellow card foul- but it was inside the box- but atletico still get the free kick at the 25yard line instead??? Am I missing something??
This was different Barca was really focused like they was final Luis Suarez scored he’s own ex club Gavi header then jordi Alba insane goal from assist Dani alves
.
Solo fue un partido hala madrid
so weird seeing auba in a barca shirt. watch his get back into goal scoring form for them. hes gonna want to play for xavi.
Commentators are absolutely horrible 🤡
What a strike of Jordy Alba has
So happy for Adams T
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Though it's a great performance on attacking half. It was another lackluster performance in defensive half, hope we find quick replacements for Pique and Busi.
This commentator makes me not want to watch la liga. ffs
wow Xavi is the man!
Bro I hate ales commentary
OK if i didn't know any better I'd say we were playing EA SPORTS  FIFA 22. These cameras make it look like so!
Number 1 on trending crazy
Haven’t been this happy watching Barcelona in a really long time
Haven’t seen camp nou lit up like this in a while.
ADAMA!!!!
I wish Adama went to Chelsea
38 year old benching dest lol no wonder they want to get rid of him
Even with 4 goals, Barcelona defenses still suck!
#1 on trending wow
that celebration Alba absolutely..
#1 on trending VISCA BARCA
I was crying seeing Dani score.
De jong was playing for free, that was clearly a red.
Dani is a 🐐
Want to know a cool fact? Find out below 👇      Jesus Christ Loves You
Finally some great performance from Barca, I hope it's the beginning of the comeback!
🏈>⚽️
Why did Dani Alves ever leave Barcelona.  Looks like he is picking up right we're he left of.  Kinda unfair to Dest to bring a legend back like that
Bayern n Real Madrid like 👁👄👁👓🤏🏿
Everything seems like it's clicking for Barcelona, well done Xavi.
Worst commentator
Those 8k shot are amazing
How do Barça go from pennyless to Arab money in footballing minutes? I'd be feeling pretty insulted if I were Messi Co. roght now.
Uighur Lives Matter!!!
These commentators suck!!!!
Sketchy pattern: Madrid teams get 6 to 10 minutes of extra time when they’re losing 🤫
Letss GOOOOOOOOO🔥
Pike don't do anything  we need him out
The second season of xavi's al sadd usually won by 4, 5, 6, 7 goals
This league lmao, way too much flopping by both teams.
what a great game !! would've been legendary if anyone other than Ale Moreno was commentating, he made me cringe over everything he said imagine Ray Hudson commentating this game ??
we just need Messi back
I watched this highlights without volume..
"Torres!!!" Oooh I thought it was Fernando Torres
Barcas  right side is starting to get interesting 👀
Not even a Barca fan but seeing them regain that faith and winning spirit is nice to see.
Super Dani Alves!
Free Dan Bongino!!
What a game, Visça Barça
720p EH SACANAGEM
Visca Barca
you see the difference between dani alves and Dest lol and Alves is like 38 years old
Man the commentators trying to degrade the great goal of Alva ... that was a great goal and great hit , no shins , right where it suppose to with spin
Who were the commentators for this game?
WHY SPOILERS IN YOUR VIDEO TITLES
Dani alves is the hero of the game.
Wow 3 goals scored by defenders😳😳
disaster performance from athletico this might be a wrap for simone
I’m madridista but boy I forgot about those alves crosses to jordi like that. Sure dest and sergi Roberto cannot create that like Dani alves
Dani Alves is the literal personification of “form is temporary, class is permanent”
Bravo Xavi
The best part about this game for barca is that they came back from being down 1-0. normally after that they would crumble
As a real madrid fan I just have one thing to say: WOW
Hopefully Dest is learning from Dani Alves cause Barca couldn’t register him for Europa League.
The financial troubles at Barca has lead to such a cool collection of players here
I swear today the defenders put on a show
Dani still looking strong for his age... What abnintroduction for Adama!!!
Incredible that Dani Alves has become an impact player at this age, unreal
Great game!
ESPN highlights and commentators are the absolute worst
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES! JESUS CHRIST CAN HEAL  YOU IF YOU TURN TO HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART..........
Jordi should be a striker sheeeeeeesssssssssshhhhhhhh
Dani Alvez is the man of the match. This is the reason he's NOT at PSG. Barca was forced the acquire him to prevent him from joining Nemar and Messi..  What a nightmare PSG would be if he did..!
I hate when they post the score in the headlines or on the Thumbnail.
Enjoy watching shithouse Atletico Madrid lose
It took just 20 mins for Adama to shut up his doubters
How old is the commentator 17???😂that’s how i used to commentate when i was playing fifa on my own😂😂
This sucks for xavi, xavi will build up the team and then the owners will hand it over to some overrated coach like mourinho and they’ll slowly destroy it.
As a Real Madrid, I admired Jordi Albas goal. He’s been through a lot and bashed with criticism. You can tell how much that goal meant to him!
Dani, Dani, Dani …..what a legend!!!
Torres is a mid player lol, he won’t get another contract
All Atletico ever do is whine and cry for red cards. Pathetic.
The quality 😮‍💨 4:58
Love xavi reactions to every game u can so tell he loves the club ❤
That goal celebration at 5:00 had like a video game look to it for some reason.
This new squad has made me start using them on fifa online seasons consistently. Super subs with pace!
5:00 I love that camera
Pobre atletico
No one watches Barcelona anymore
Good for Barca good for the fans, great for Xavi. Keep going man. You can do this!!!
I hope Barcelona get humiliated soon
This announcer Moreno is so bad..
Espn pundits dumb quiet 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 all that adama slander
Traore is such an amazing player. saddened Barca managed to snag him
Laporta trying to seat Dembelé Xavi trying to seat Dembelé you know what bro 😎 Adama is here lol 😂
Piquè!!!! You are so bad! Leave bro! Does anyone have a new challenge for him? I feel like he is too rich to give a sh… about football
Adama was great in this game
What a game!!! Dani Alves is a GOAT!!!this is the Barca we want to see!!!!
Dani Albee still got it he’s insane
People said Dani Alvez wouldn’t start and he’s to old , yeah right
Opinión umilde ..aqui con el gol de Alba nos damos cuenta lo grande que es la portería o "los 3 palos y para meter goles es cuestión de técnica y saver pegarle ala # 5 ...lindo gol
Who is that Alli guy commentating lol. he sucks at commentating. Some guys are better at the studio.
Barcelona finding their place once again
MY TEAM IS BACKKKKK!!!!!! WAS WITH YOU< IS WITH YOU AND WILL BE WITH YOU! FOREVER BARCA!
Daniel Alves will bring world cup to brazil
Glad Barca played a good game, but AM missed some easy goals, which would have changed everything.  Barca's D is still very vulnerable on counters.  FINALLY started attacking and forward ball movement improved bc of Adama & Pedri.  Barca O smothered midfield and pressed well. Just need Busquets to learn to run forward to attack, instead of stopping for a back pass.
It's good to have Dani Alves back because dest is going to learn a lot from him we need a Dani Alves in the usa I have faith on dest
This is the type of football I wanted to see from Barcelona. Perfect crosses, perfect passes and great finishes. Even with this scoreline there is pllenty of room to improve, especially in terms of finishing tbh. I really enjoyed seeing Barcelona playing crosses finally idk why La Liga teams don’t play them as much as other leagues.
Is it me or football is becoming more lazy.
Actually made me smile watching
Hi not a soccer fan here. Why is this trending? Is this like a championship or something?
Dani alves has always had a good leg i knew he was gonna score that.
I feel bad for u guys! That u have this shitty commentator
Joao Felix needs to go back to Portugal
Who are these commentators for God's sake! 🤦‍♂️
Back at #1 trending
What happened with the foul on Busquets near the end? He got "chicken winged", as Ale would call it, by the Atletico defender. Atletico get the yellow card, but Barca didn't get even a freekick on the edge of the box, much less a Penalty??? So confused as to how Atletico got the card, AND the ball back. Please, someone enlighten me.
Congrats barca!!! It had been tough for the team.. glad they came out on top today!!!
Danieal Alves, Jordi Alba, Luis Suarez, and Xavi, man they still legends from the old dynasty!
These commentators are awful
horrible commentators
Moreno is so annoying Jfc stfu
Barça becoming our new favorite underdogs lol or dark horse at least
i dont even know anything about soccer
Best part is that we did it without dembele. Hopefully he feels out of place.
This ali guy is the worst commentator i have ever seen! 🤦🏻 The guy criticizes players so damm much for no reason! Smh
As funny as it is to watch Barcelona be terrible, it’s a nice flash from the past to watch them play this well, I still think they might need a better manager than xavi at least for now while he learns
Seeing Barcea fans so happy! Ok
Who told you that you have to put  the score in the tittle of the video....?..Who told you that ?..If you read the tittle,,thats no thrill....!!F I !!!
Dani Alves, man. Chills.
Best Barca game since Messi’s departure
This is really cool
Ferran Torres was the flop we needed.  Couldn’t finish but got himself in the right situations. Allowed for others to also be available
I miss Ray Hudson as LaLiga commentator 😭 Great game by Barca and good luck in the champions league Atlético
Aubomeyang’s defensive and hold up play was outstanding.
4:19 shows what Barca has been missing for years is the leadership that Dani is bringing.
Glad to see the opps back in form.  Hala madrid.
Simeone needs to put Lodi in the LB. Can't keep putting Hermoso as a improvised LB.
Adama instant impact
If Koeman was today as Atlético coach: this is what we got!🤣🤣🤣
Man this match really made me smile 😃
that new commentator's voice is very aggravating
This english commentary is awful thank God I know spanish
Barca just served notice to the Europa league …
these is the Barcelona we know and love great win
Vamossssssss Carajo
Xavi pls bring the tiki taka back and you will save the barca
Anyone else hate the first commentator just hate way he speaks on team and players
One day Gavi will be wearing that #10 jersey🤙🏽. One day.
Ali Moreno is painful to listen to
Bruh the commentary is so trash
Get rid of dembele and depay this what you get
Best RB of all time: Dani Alves!!! ❤️💙🤌
that guy from espn extra time is bad commentator bro, and he swears like his opinions and comments can never be wrong
Traore’s physical shape! Wow! I wish I had half of that muscle mass! 😯
So proud of barca🔴🔵🔴🔵
just need a better defense now
This season has been full of surprises, but I'm glad barca got the W today! Haven't been this happy in a while for this team! 😌
Que golazo
Breaks my heart to see Alves away for all those years. He is full of energy, quality and fire. Truly the best full back of all time.
Visca barca!!!
Change that commentator! 🤦🏿‍♂️
I will repeat it again..Ale Moreno is worst fkn commentator of all time
Adama has got such a lethal burst when he starts running like sheesh
I did not enjoy the commentating, I could have done a better job
Ahora si le veo futuro al Barcelona
The power of leadership! I am so greatly happy for Xavi!
Alex Moreno commentary was so annoying
As a Real Madrid fan this is nice to see again
Adama already making a cross connect? Deserves the RW position over Dembele for sure
alves has done more in 1 game than dest in his whole time at barca
I can’t get use to this commentator!!! I miss Phil so much , we need bein with la liga rights again !!!
Nice game I like all those new player but I still think that they go change the defense pique it’s just a rock on the field 🤦🏻‍♂️
I really don’t like the espn announcers at all. I miss Ray Hudson
I still can’t believe we managed to get aubameyang , I also have a good feeling he’s gonna do great
Dani Alves, what a fullback
xavi is doing great job.
Barcelona played phenomenal tonight. Great performances. Adama and Alves destroyed that right side. Although this was a poor side from Atletico. It was definitely an improvement from Barcelona overall. 3 points much needed and deserved
Visca Barca Visca Catalunya
3 goals on oblak was impossible for him to save but the volley he had a chance to save from Dani alves
Don't forget A. Traore  was playing without his baby oil  , can u imagine  traore after a baby oil bath 😱
Since when Ferran and Traore transfer?  What a show
Happy for Adama
Xavi doing good.  Brought them from like 9th or 10th place to 4th.  And kept the 4 3 3 formation.
Bro, Oblak was horrific today
Barcelona wins one good game and all of a sudden it’s “Barca back on top!” 😂😂😂 these are the same people that say “the Goat is back” after Messi scored today in UberEats league, meanwhile if Ronaldo scored 2 goals in 13 games in the PREMIER, it would be “Penaldo is washed” 😂 the double standards are amazing.
Replacing Ray Hudson with Alejandro Moreno is quite possibly the biggest downgrade in history. I can't bear to hear his voice. He always sounds like he has no idea what he's talking about and just gives the most basic commentary.
The type of foutbal I wish Manchester United were playing.
Not a Barca fan, but watching them have a beautiful game put a smile on my face
I remember when Davis was brought to Barca when the team had a crisis and that guy show the  team what is called heart… I’ve seen alces today and he is doing the same thing when this team now…
I love the commentary by Ali!
Good to see Barca competing with the Big Clubs!! 😂😂
Ale is by far my favorite commentator right now!!!  Does it come off the shin it doesn’t matter 😂😂
Aurajo could of slid and block that first goal
Two words: Dani Alves. He played so good today against Atleti. Defending, assists, even scoring. Although he did get a red card, he was so good for us. Also, props to Jordi Alba. I haven't seen him play this good in so many months. That goal though, just shocked me. The volley was so good. You have to be top-quality to put a type of volley like that into the back of the net, especially past on of the best GK's, Oblak. The whole Barca team played well. Congrats to Barca for the win.
Its a statement to prove they are coming back to their absolute best and winning trophies soon. Have to say Barca and Juve had the best winter transfer window, happy with the likes of Adama, Aubemeyang, Ferran.
that preformance by atleti is just unacceptable. we were out played, but that defending is just awful. we can hardly keep possession. hermoso and koke out
What was ferran doing?
VAMOOOS
I’m sorry but Ale Moreno’s commentary is horrid. Not entertaining, doesn’t educate, and half the time goes on about absolute non sense. One of the worst I’ve ever heard call a professional match.
adama is our savior, he knows what to do!
Erling Haaland this is the team for you!!
Barca started spending money left and right again I see. I thought they were almost broke. Is that the money they got for Messi that they are spending now?
Alba nd Dani doing what they always been doing when Messi was there .. thru ball, fake it nd let the ball go . Then (Messi)Dani comes nd makes a banger
Let’s go Barca, Xavi may save our season.
Barca weak AF..... Enjoy a victory here and there.... Y’all mid table for the rest yo lives ..... Shame on you for disguising  the release of Messi.... Worst board leadership in global club history....
Can we get anything from Ter Stegen anymore…. Thank God for our new additions and youth
Welcome to Barca Adama, great assist
ITS A GREAT DAY TO BE A BARCA FAN nd Messi fan
I was a Messi fan but dam I’m becoming a barca fan 😮‍💨 lil by lil 🤩
but how about eren in this new episode
There is undeniable new energy about this Barca team!
Rough game for fernan Torres I hope he can bounce back next week
This is Barca, !!! TIKI TAKA is BACK !!!!  vs who , athletico ? No problem 😌. 4-2 Next !!! Welcome to the XAVI ERA !!! Get used to it !!!!
Dani alves still at 38.better that all them young guys ok .plus he plays for free basically. Cuz the love he got for barca ok .messi will be back summer at barca .Madrid watch out ok we still got 6 month left and a good striker now .ok Bettis you're next ok
We won a game our my eyes playing with me 💀
YESSSSS VISCA BARCA💪🔴🔵❤️💙
These commentators are awful
It makes me feel like Barcelona in 2013 Let's go!!!!!!! Barca
One more time for dani alves.. what a legend. Tom brady vibes
Man these are the worst absolute commentator i have ever heard… this guy makes my ears bleed
what a game for barcelona its amazing todays performance
Im sorry but the second commentator is so annoying, that alba goal was perfect  It wasnt a miss hit
I feel bad for depay and dembele, now with auba and Adama cementing their spot in the starting 11, they won’t get any minutes😭
Please for the love of God, get someone other than Alejandro Moreno to comment on these games. The dude comes off as a complete douchey know-it-all
I liked that Suarez kept his celebration to himself
Just beautiful
Happy for barca so much for playing like that ❤️💙
Dani Alves well done man! he's a crack.
These commentators are so boring
U guys gotta remember Atletico barely made it outta da UCL group. so VARca winning is nothing to be proud of. Atleti hvnt been playing well
Suarez doesn't celebrate his goal 😔 what a classy player.
Happy for once in a while . This is a good feeling .
i missed dani alves & his crosses 🔥
What an assist from Ferran! 😂
Bro i despise this announcer w all my heart all he can say is poor defending
Golazzzzzzo
Keep up the great work Barcelona. Alves is # 1
This is the Barca we know and love.
missed the 2nd half but wow amazing from barça!!!! 💙❤️
I’m genuinely happy
AM has been effective, but i HATE their style. Glad the Xavi led team took it to them.
Moreno wanted to trash Barcelona so bad, but he got his mouth shut. Barcelona may not be at its best yet, but its not the trash Moreno wants it to be.
Imagine if Barca would of kept Dani Alves man o man 🔥👌🏼 beast
Dani alves has to go down if not the best one of the best rb to ever play the game. At his age, playing at the highest level and producing results ! I can only 👏
One of the commentators please change they guy is sooo annoying
7:37 alves lets him go??? Is that mf blind? Suarez clearly pushed alves.
People are blaming the couch of atlético de Madrid but thanks to that coach they started to win because they used to lose every match until that coach came and remember they were the champions last year and i think atletico plays pretty good but they start playing good until they are losing i watched the game live and they started doing so good when it was 4-2 and i think people is blaming the coach just because Suárez is out of control he just fights with everyone blame his teammates and insulted the coach maybe because of that everyone hates the coach because Suárez is so big but I'm not saying he's not good I'm just saying he used to be a lot better and he couldn't touch the ball the goal that he did was because of an assist but other than that he couldn't touch the ball and he did touch the ball but he didn't play that good also Jao felix he lost the ball everytime but when it was 4-2 atlético had most of the possession and started playing so good and i think they should play like that every minute not just when they are losing  Btw i love Barca and Barca is one of the best teams in the world but i am an atlético fan because they suffer a lot but when they win is so good  But good game it was an excellent game and congrats to the new member of Barca that did the assist i love Barca and atlético !
you know it's 2022 when people are surprised seeing Barca win like this
I came in to watch after 20 mins, and they were outstanding the first half.. first 10 mins of second were well. And afterwards very scary.. almost thinking barcelona were going to put their guard down.. but good game overall Visca barça!❤💙
Great win
Dani Alves , what a player !!!! Just like wine 🍷, getting old and getting better.
Adana debut is the best just perfect assist
Gavi at 5-5 going over everybody for the header was pure class.
3:25 “mismatch!” I love this commentator
Luck of the Champions 🍀🍀!! Let’s go Barca🔥🔥
If Traore can improve his passing and Torres can fix his vision, with the addition to auba in front🤌🏼
Dani Alves doing Dani Alves things. Great game!
What a brilliant display from Barca
Awesome game but poor commentary 😬😬😬
Fkkkk yall suck
The true face of Atletico Madrid, not worthy enough to be the last champion...but that's Simeone signature!!!🤭🤣🤣
I know this is only the tenth league game in charge for Xavi but I can't help but feel like this is his signature win  oh and we're only 2 points back from betis with a game in hand, also back in a top 4 spot which is nice
That first goal from Barcelona was so good 🤩
When Jordi Alba scored that goal I knew this game was going to be special.
Adama Traore is the key. He gives the team faster pace and makes it more dynamic. I really hope Xavi uses him wisely and his teammates can keep up with his speed. This is the first time I don't curse at the team in a long time
9:05 watch how De Jong makes contact but lets his leg come back towards his body… smart kid making sure to not cause an injury + red card.
Adama💪🏾❤
😍💙❤
the camera is so hd
Adama will be Barcelona’s underrated signing of the year. People downplay him because of his stats. He has unbelievable pace, dribbling, and strength.  Once he perfects his shooting like Vinicius JR, he would be world class.
Que borroso se mira estos vídeos
I always loved Adamas play style. Just pure strength and take ons🔥🔥🔥
What a match! Crazy to think 3/4 of our goals came from defenders
Dani alves this man is crazy 38 and still putting in performances like this bruh, I'm a Madrid fan but Dani alves is my favorite right back he is too good to nor respect and admire.
Just got chills from the dani alves to jordi alba gol
Inexcusable for Atletico!
This fills me with hope 💙❤️
Wow, Dani Alves showing his class
This commentator infuriates me.
Good W, defense still needs work.
Jordi alaba wit da volley 🤦🏽‍♂️🔥🔥
Watching Barca play like this feel so different, they looked really determined , focus and like they wanted to attack . Unlike the days when they would constantly pass back . Really amazing , can’t wait for fati to recover
The only bad thing about this game was ale morenos commentary
Barca’s best game so far and we have to listen to it with Ale Moreno commentating
Dani alves is amazing
With all these new signings by Barca, the teams gives off a totally new vibe and energy and you could see it in their performance. I am a Juventus fan and I'm glad things are looking good for Barca at the moment.
My Sunday got better....when Atleti got the first, for the first time in months, I was calm. Good stuff from all the players today. Visca Barca!!!
Adama traore is exactly what Barca needs. A winger that is brave enough to dribble past defenders, kind of like Neymar, someone who can create chances but isn’t afraid to do set of skills to dribble past defenders. Adama is exceptional really.  From the passed failed Barca transfers (dembele, coutinho, and griezmann) adama seems very promising. I don’t want to jinx it, but adama’s playing style is the best thing for Barca right now
Nice goal Alaba keep up Barcelona
Gavi is the future of futbol!
This commentators are just terrible how can you turn great game a in to such a boring experience
The commentators, they don’t rhyme
🥰😇🤍🖤😇🥰
Nobody talking about Alba’s goal
Atletico said we won the league last year so time to tank the next 20 years. They have been horrendous with their defense. Might be worse than Barca's defense and thats a shocker.
Xavi really made a huge difference, way to go!
Doesn’t matter if the goal was off his shin. That was an amazing goal by Jordi Alba. 🙇‍♂️ 🙇‍♂️ 🙇‍♂️
Going into this match I don’t know why but I just knew and felt we were gonna get the job done and in a beautiful way visca Barca ❤️💙❤️💙
Let’s go Barca but some of those goals were kinda lucky let’s be honest
Coming from a Real Madrid. I'm happy for Barcelona! Bring back good spanish soccer !
Barca won cause Atletico de madrid is trash right now.
Great game...😍
Bro imagine this Real Madrid Facing PSG as a local and All Barcelona fans still have Messi Shirt and coming to The Bernabeu like the old times and still knowing who Own the Beranbeu Messi
Why does the ref look like Oscar Isaac
Barcelona celebrating like they just won the league 😏
Alba’s Goal of the year nominee with that sexy spin and placement execution.
That’s why Spurs needed Adama
what a performance…adama
2:13 imagine Ray Hudson commentating this goal. This guy not it
Very little mistake from Ferran cost a goal
If you watched the game you’d realize Atleticos defense were scared of Adama.
Dani Alvarez ruined this game. That was so dirty and unnecessary.
Tiki taka 💙♥️
Dani Alves ballin at 38
I’ve always been crying tears of pain 😭 but this time I’m dropping tears 😭 of joy after a decade, the whole team made us Barcelona fans beyond happy… with that being said, Alba’s goal was out of this planet 💣 with an everlasting Daniel Alves… thank y’all for making us Barca fans proud again 😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰
Araujo scored and give a goal too
I always miss the good games :(
I like this new Barcelona ❤️💙🧡
This narrator is a Real Madrid.
What a performance from Barcelona, now just imagine how thrilling the game between Barcelona and Napoli will be, how amazing
Man idk Joao es really not doing much he’s not a game changing player
Barcelona needs defenders
I'm amazed at this win forca barca
Please stop silencing the crowd noise especially in Camp Nou. It ruins the atmosphere when all u can hear is the commentator
Torres , traore ,gavi is the perfect front line for both Barcelona at least until fati comes back fit . Auba  can be the impact sub
Farmers league
If they can keep winning...they might finish ahead of Madrid by the 38th matchday, Madrid started to crumble already...
💙❤️
I can't believe Xavi is really playing Dani Alves over Dest.
Bro I looked up the game Nd I saw 4-2 athletic got destroyed
Ale's commentary is abysmal. Watched the game in spanish even though I don't understand spanish. I miss Phil Schoen and Ray Hudson in these games.
@9:06. If Frenkie was BLACK, this is a straight red. It's way worse than Dani Alves's. We get reminded of these things everyday.
The best thing that has happened to Barca in recent times is that they got rid of the ‘white elephant ‘and his wages and the drama surrounding him,  second best thing was sacking that Dutch guy now slowly things will fall into place with  xavi at helm
Alves is 38 playing like he’s in his prime 😂 his body may not be the same but he’s smart and def adjusted his game to fit him
Dani alves is love dani alves is life
Alves Is in good good good physical shape. Yes he won’t be running down the wing like he did in his main years, but that man is a huge huge asset for barça
When I woke up, I genuinely thought there was a glitch, I couldn’t believe they were winning 3-1
Tan mal esta el atlético madrid a que juegan
All the goals came from missing the first touch and off rebounds, I call that all lucky goals... 😂🤣😷
Vamosssssssss
Letting Dani Alves go was the stupidest thing Barcelona ever did. He is the leader Messi NEVER was.
Oh man today’s match gave me goosebumps!!! Like so beautiful see a barca slowly forming into a monster again
Athletico Madrid is so terrible now, the same as Manchester united. That goal that Alba scored was 😘😘👌👌👌.
WHAT A GAME !!!!
I’m a Real Madrid fan but always loved  seeing Barca play beautiful fútbol
Efecto Javier 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Dani Alves the 🐐
Watch them Tie 0-0 next game lol
Can the second commenter shut up bruh. So annoying, giving a breakdown of what players should do like he played at that level
Show the starting lineups at the beginning.
I refuse to believe this is barca, overall tho much love from a roma fan
Before watching this highlight, Barca won the match After watching these highlights, Athletico didn't play well.
Don’t know if it’s just the coverage but the atmosphere sounded flat and lifeless. This is a huge win for Barca. Putting 4 past Oblak is no small feat. Visca Barca
Very poor game by Atletico!!!
I still hate not seeing suarez with barca
this commentator isn’t it 🥲
Dani alvez!!! Adama!!! This is looking good. More movement more confidence in the team.
Man what a banger from alba
Hope Barcelona plays every game like this!
They still suck without messi
This guy Ale Moreno is the worst announcer I have ever listened to in any sport
Great performance by Barca, especially the 1st half. Seemed to lose cohesion after Pedri was taken off.
felix needs to get out of madrid.
Viça Barca
Wow as a Madrid fan I’m really hoping this Barca squad finished top 3 j not the first
Dani Alves participó en los 4 goles
They s really won a big game I can’t believe this 😭
I’m a real Madrid fan but Barca played really good
Lucky win, still a long way to go.
Wouldn’t be a good game from Barca without Dani getting a red card lol
On paper, United should be robbing their hands against this weakened Athletico side......but🤦🏿‍♂️
alves is old as helk but plays good
Is it just me or did Suarez push Dani with 1 hand and then a score if he did that’s supposed to a foul but whatever this ref hated Barca there was also to supposed to a penalty for Barca
Prime Dani alves, Prime Marcelo...best full back duo of all time 👏🏾👏🏾
Man I'll never forget that 2-8 score for ever and ever. Eat that barsa fans 😆.
Yeah I'm thinking we're back!
Barca is back 🔥
2:12 Gosh I hate this commentator. Such a vibe killer.
Gotta love how ferran Torres just kicks the fall in celebration
Barca got their confidence back with their new signings, I'm glad.
So much respect for Dani Alves, coming from a RM fan. Glad to see him doing well
Best win of the season for us
What's the definition of a banger? Alba: Yes
defense is their weakness
I could not stand watching this full game with this commentator
Terrible commentary but hopefully this Is the start of something new for Barca
Ferran is phenomenal!
Simeone stile is outdated falling behind of modern football, attacking is the best Defence strategy sometimes.
My goodness! We haven't seen Barca play this good in years! The plays, the teamwork, just everything! Scoring 4 on Oblak is no easy task, 1-2 passes, Wing crosses, the use of RB Alves, I mean my god can we talk about Alves? Assist, crosses, defending, SCORING. The whole team just played AMAZING! Very exciting
Excited about Traore, not about Abumeyang. He’s gonna have to do a lot to satisfy. His career as of late has been quite lacking.
What a entertaining game 🔥🔥❤️
OMG WE BACK
Why is no one talkn about albas goal. That joint was nasty
Amazing performance from Adam 👏🏼
Hearing Ally on the highlights makes me grateful I litened to Diego Forlan and team on ESPN's Spanish language broadcast.
La Liga spectators most of them wearing masks but PL almost no one is wearing a mask.
Dani Alves crosses 🤩🤩 what a beast!!!
What a game xavi making an impact I can’t wait to see more of these new signings
4 shots on target and 4 goals…. Lol and ppls keep saying best keeper in the world
Traore doing what he does best. Outrunning defenders and then crossing
Koeman could never lmao and dembele is definitely not needed. I don't know why people acted as if he was mbappe level. We have a very talented and entertaining squad without him. His stats suck!
Dani ALVES u are a beast and gavi was amazing so was alba and now we got xavi is the coach this team will amazing. Traore was also great man I don’t know why he took him out
04:30 why was Felix putting his hand up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love You!!! Xavi great coach.
The best part of the game is the respect Simeone gave to Xavi, he didn’t just run to the lockers this time. I wish ATM had their key players like Griezmann, but great performance from Barcelona nonetheless 🤝
What a performance by alves 👏🏻 legend 🇧🇷
ESPN pleeeeeeeease get some better quality analysts
Amazing game, lot of new barca players
What Barcelona winning big again
Barcelona is back
I'm honestly surprised how badly atletico lost
Dani Alves is something else man. Hats off to him.
Adama proving the doubters wrong 👏
Dani alves is a beast
being real madrid fan i have really enjoyed barcalona losing but it looks like we may have a challenger for the up coming years. Lots of potential in this team.
Bisca Barca bisca cataluña ❤️💙❤️💙
I still feel like Xavi should have chosen Dani over Auba in the 3 player registered players for the Europa League.
This Barcelona team is actually very interesting to watch lol.
Lol pique is garbage why is he still at Barca
Finally!
The defense is more of an offensive threat than the strikers
Look at the Referee's History against Barcelona.. We gotta fix this already.  Referees are so dumb! We got cameras everywhere referee! We don't need y'all dumb mutha fuckas!!!!!!
7:19 the look he did 😔
The second commentator is so incredibly annoying
Moonknight is a referee?
Could have easily ended 4-4. Lol Barça fans are very delusional. 3 very lucky barça goals 😂 and a couple of atletico misfires.
Every barca player had a great game today but what a goal by Jordi Alba man
This is the way. I have faith in these players and I trust in Xavi. Visca El Barça!!! 💙❤️💙
Aubameyang came on wrong moments other wise he will score goal Barca mind was great today
feran torres is the weak link
Europe be scared, theyre coming back for their throne and everything that belongs to Barca
Traore can finally boost his stats from playing with players who can score
That Hispanic guy, is a terrible commentary 😂 🤣 💀. He sucked as a player as well. Please get him off 🙏
This Barca team was great  Xavi is building something dangerous 😳
Alba doesn't score much but when he does, it's a worldie.
Barca need a new keeper
WHAT A PERFORMANCE FROM BARCELONA RESPECT TO EL PISTOLERO AS WELL
I can’t be the only one to find Alex Moreno annoying. Lol  Other than that, great game by Barcelona!
Well done defenders. You'll really put up a show today. Dani, u keep on doing it my man. Barcelona Barcelona Barcelona ❤❤❤
It's the man with negative corazón
Dani Alves is an OG that ball to jordi….small plays like that make the big difference in games like these
ADAMA NEW MESSI?!?!
Thanks for the high lights espn !
4 goals on oblack
Adama played a great game, hopefully we finally see his full potential unlocked at Barca
Our first win vs a world class team since 2020
Adama brilliant debut! Auba came in when we had 11 and moments later 10. When he had the ball he was holding it and waiting for the team. Very smart play from Auba! Dani what a game very strong performance again! (Red can was fair he was late but still strong performance.) Torres still adapting but played a good Number 9 role and opened up and moved around which opened spaces for our midfield and defense to have bodies in the box. Excited for the rest of the season probably Barcelonas best game and Xavi’s also.
Vamooooooos, Visça Barça 🔴🔵
i'm a real madrid fan but i like how barca did this match because the clasico will be more interesting and all .
It’s only the beginning of a new era, this might be the turning point for Barca
Barcelona performance is getting better without pepsi
1:47 Dani .. Albeh ALBA
The Barca were used to seeing
Adama Traoré... welcome back!!!
The same commentator praising Dani was mocking him when he was signed. Thanks for the love Ali!
Dani Alves with a vintage goal!
Dany Alves y put that guy on top of this generation as Ronaldo and Messi he is been consistent great player for like 20 years almost 🙌
Adama on that right wing looks pretty amazing, if I were Xavi i would try in a match for 30 minutes a front 3 of Dembele, Auba, and Adama, talk about pace!
Alejandro Moreno should never call a game again
Ronaldo Aruajo, what a player. Clearly if he was English he would’ve been displayed as the best center back in the world.
Alejandro Moreno is a horrible commentator. The things he says are just cringe.
La coladera de pique. Que payaso ese defensa . Quieren segir mamandosela .
XAVI SEASON
Barca scoring 4 goals from set-pieces and crosses then park the bus after Dani's red card that just different and good for Barca
Never seen camp nou as happy as this
Incredible game ❤️💙
We're the adama haters at ?
Just what a game from Barca today am very proud of how there performance keeps improving
Xavi is doing an excellent job
Xavi is going to change this barca team you can already see the difference!!!
This is why when was my sister was studying in Toledo 2013, I asked for a Xavi jersey. IYKYK.
Once atletico madrid scored I thought it was over man. I thought they were going to park the bus but no I’m so glad Barca were able to score +3 goals against the champions of spain🔥❤️💙
alba take a bow
barca is back! a great game that had it all and an impressive performance from barca on the back of our new signings. you can really tell the work that xavi has done since he arrived. finally we have a great coach. and a few words on dani alves. at almost 39 years old this man was incredibly influential up until his unfortunate red card. truly one of the best right backs ever if not the best and still delivering like the player he always was. unbelievable stuff from dani alves our legend. now the team can only grow from this massive win and we go into the top four. our club is massive guys, just when it was looking like we were going down bad we’re already going back up. VISCA BARCA🔴🔵
Bueno barcelona
who else hates the espn commentators? they’re just awful
All Goals   0:59 0-1 Atleti GOAL  1:46 1-1 Barca GOAL 3:02 2-1 Barca GOAL 4:49 3-1 Barca GOAL 5:53 4-1 Barca GOAL  7:04 4-2 Atleti GOAL   Full time - barca 4-2 atleti
Adama must’ve given barca some of his baby oil today or sum, Barca produced magic today!
Wow what a performance from the Catalans  💙❤️💙❤️💙
FERRAN TORRES missed 3 clear opportunities, just wow, ADAMA is already far superior of an option for XAVI.
YESSS
To think people were saying Adama Traore was going flop. Power and speed will never flop in a lower and less athletic league like La Liga.
Great win for Barca visca Barcelona.💙❤️💙❤️😍😍
Now we see the difference between Alves, Dest and Semedo. Alves is almost 60 but plays way better than the 20 year old. Smh!!! Shame on Dest and Semedo lol.
UN DIA DE PARTIT ❤️💙
Dani alves is literally benching dest at the age of 38 what a legend.
Atletico played horrible, well deserved win for Barca! Araujo is a beast
What a game. Such a needed win and it was by a lot that we won. Adam played extremely good for his first game for Barcelona already. Hope he plays better.
If Messi stayed at Barca what would’ve the result of this Mach
Everyone was hating when we signed Traore but he got an assist after 30 mins
Oblack ☠☠☠
Horrible inglés
Sevilla fan, happy to see this club finding form again 🤙 very good match from Barca
No trophies this season its okay lets get back to the Top 💙❤️ViscaBarca🔥
Madrid still the best 😤
What a win for us barca fans, adama will be such a good asset for us ⚡️
Finally, a big game has been won! Xavi effect.
What a game!
Can’t remember the last time Barca won a match as big as this, great game
4 goles del Barça?? Estoy soñando verdad
Dani Alves showing his strong mentality again. 👏👏
Who’s this messi guy ? Is he a type of plant or something ?
Fc Barcelona never give up
Love this team man, so much potential it’s crazy.
Let's go barcelona vamos barcelona
Simeone need to do gegenpress
🤩 Dani Alba!
Dani Alves truly is the best fullback of all time
LOVE THIS TEAM ❤️💙
Wow 🤩 Dani Alba!
Lets go barcaa
Great transfers
Barca is coming back to it’s best
Don’t ever disrespect Adams Traore and say he is not a talent 😤😤
Koeman had Messi and many more and couldn’t produce this magic Xavi brought in just under a few months
Adama great game
I’m thrilled! Most entertaining win for us this season💙❤️
Let’s goooo
