You are lik milli boby brown
I can tell you my favorite color. My favorite color is navy blue.
The writing without clicking the pen when you’re about to get caught is so real
9:05 I was shocked by the loud pop. That sounded like it hurt.

❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think I have those same exact pens 🤣 4:50
"I'm too pretty for this" help I'm on the floor dieing of laughter rn
"Only the best for you dear" the best line in history
Nah the asmr is too good even youtube watched and commented on this video
the part were your like are you done with this class sounded like a add
4:51❤
hiii Jocie bonita! :)  creo que no te encanta usar bubble gum en tus videos, pero sigo regresando a este video en los minutitos que mascas bubble yum... they're glorious!  is it any chance that you might consider making a video for gum chewing lovers? 💕 big love from Mexico!
This video makes my heart happy bc I have not felt a part of something in so long. ❤🥲
1:27😂
I had a headache and was watching  this and writing my book, and this was a good alternative to music, it helped me relax, so thianknyou for this amazing asmr
Rainbow like me!
3:45🎉
Is she an elf?
Mind Ur business 😂😂😂 That how U know someone is nice they can't pretend to be mean
When she said " I just wanted to be mindful of that" all I could think about was VERY  DEMURE VERY MINDFUL
Where are the stickers from 😅
Who's here in November 2024??!

idk what i was doing🙃
Its called super scary but idk what that mean had me on the floor lol
What’s up with the star on ur face 😮
25
The side eye with the “Mind your business.” Killed me 💀💀
The side eye when she doesn’t want the “teacher” to see what she’s doing 😆 2:18
I love your hairstyle and make up and shirt and earrings and EVERYTHING in this video always pretty but prettier here❤

Collabe with Esme ASMR
レイトンミースターかと思った
Don't you all just hate it when you're trying to sleep and almost asleep then a loud a*s add pops up and you almost have a damn heart attack and throw your phone but it doesn't break but you clicked on a game after and your phones on full volume?
My fav part is 40:51
Can you do a video where you are a face painter and do close up painting and drawing on our face with drawing and painting sounds please? I liked and subscribed, post notifications are on!
now I'm not falling asleep I'm falling in love sorrry
You know what, you should do aversion where we get caught and do Asmr in detention!!!! 😮
I would get caught immediately- unless the teacher just doesn’t care bc my whispers are loud-
Comment if your to pretty for this
Just noticed you had elf ears on lol-
Why have I found no comments on that mischevious grins, she seriously is like- (>:3) I'm breaking all the rules! texting for notes, drawing on your face, just- she gives the best evil grins, I love it
“I guess I’m.. dying inside-“ Who isn’t
This who,s video is ngl just me- especially getting excited about the mushroom sticker and going like “😮” at every cute sticker I see
“I promise you my hands are clean.. don’t even worry about it” she says right after she spits her gum out in her hand
Girl boss vibe and Hi YouTube :)
I would enjoy friends like this.
7:34 loud is fine
“Cause I’ll be very entertained” ope!
I HAVE A SLUG LIKE THAT TOO, his name is Policarpio but he is not as colorful as yours, he is kinda emo 😔
“..I’m dying inside, such an old person already…”
I think half of the views on this video came from me. This video always helps me sleep. Thank you Jocie💞
Jocie not only holds a safe space, they role model kindness & host a socially healthy community in their comment threads. Amazing work!
The pimple patch box tapping sounded like those wooden fros of you know what I’m talking about. Anyone know what I’m talking about?
Give me back my slug. Those are mine.😄
I need to know where to find that little pimple patch case!!!!!
*jocie
This is my fav Jocje B ASMR vid its the best and sooo tingly!!!
44:12 was my fav part
As a people pleaser THANK YOU FOR BEING MINDFUL OF BOUNDARIES
i wouldnt be surprised if youre the whole school's bestie
12:23 I litterly pointed somewhere random and Jocie actually put the pimple patch there- WITHOUT GOING FORWARD OR KNOWING
Her voice souns a lot different now❤
I love the chewing sound😩😫❤️

fun fact about those gel ink pens... they don't wash away with soap and water! in my experience they've lasted on my skin for at least a few days
I love this. The best video of juicy

I fall asleep this every night
I saw all ur videos Today i found this one. I think this is the best on ur collection
Jesus loves you
I'm ToO PrETTy FOr ThIs
Hi😊❤😊
Suspension of disbelief broken. No one in their right mind would let a high schooler draw on their face. That's just asking for phallic symbols to be on the middle of your forehead lmao
There name is “CASSIEOPIA” that’s my favee😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love when she says that
Kids at the back of the class be like:
0:17 is relaxing
Why is she so beautiful 😭✨😍
16:52 her smile is so cute!!!
You’re sooooo pretty and I love your hair ❤ your voice is really relaxing 😌 ✨💕🌈
ok but the pens look sooooo nice
My boyfriend doesn't really give me much personal attention, and it's something I feel I'm missing out on a lot, so your videos really help
I wish we could be friends, you seem really nice.
I love the elf ears and the I’m too pretty for this got me bursting in joy keep doing what you do and do your best!
If someone as cute as Jocie wanted to draw all over my face I wouldn’t even give it a second thought☺️
I love the stickers and gum 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 pls give me some stickers pls iam a big fan i live in nepal
Hi
I LOVE YOUR STYLE😍😍
I have a question. Where you buy this stickers? (soory my english is not good)

The elf ears 😂❤
Is it just me, or when she talks to the camera i silently talk back? Just me? Ok-
You ruined whole video by chewing this gum
This video actually made me watch the whole video I have a 2 second attention spam- tysm for making this
Та самая я руская сматрю еë и мне очень нравится ❤😊
100% honestly... YEARS ago when I was in school... I would have been the friend she texted to get the notes from because I was a METICULOUS note taker....but the other girls always wanted to play with my hair during class... which I let them (hint... those are my favorite trigger videos lol)
People sometimes wear clothing that’s their favourite colour ^__^
"I am too pretty for this" Is my new mantra 🤭 Amazing video as always, and I love the sword earrings!!💖 Have a great sleep everyone!
Y’all where do I get those pimple patches I NEED them 🥺
Girl were 48seconds into class and you already wanna leave
POV: me and my friend every day in all our classes expect reading❤
aww you’re giving tinker bell vibes in this video 😭💕

16:53 THE SMILE IS SO CUTE IM DEAD 💀💀💀
I have the same fuzzy pen that's shown in the thumbnail

I love how caring she is towards her fans ❤
Me? I LOVE THIS!! you are such a vibe gurl you’re the best
I actually have those same pens sitting somewhere in my art supplies cubbie
Jocie: *pulls out gum* The whole freaking class: MINE GIMME
You should make a hot Cheetos girl version of this
This is calming to me to watch ❤
Would you be willing to do another one like this but without/less of the mouth sounds? I LOVED the face drawing ❤️ but I don’t care as much for the gum chewing sounds or the pencil/pen chewing…
The girl beside her : what are you two doing  Her: mind ur business 🙄
I love the cross earrings and theme of this vid! Sooo satisfying 😁
My actual classmates : *Twerking, Flirting with me, touching each other*
I love this video😗
♾
Please joice make one more like this
"Mind your business!" *Wink*
Those little star pimple patches are cutee. I havent really seen them a lot anywhere, does anyone know where you can find those?
It's the "I'm too pretty for this" and "mind your business" for me 😂
Green is my fav too,especially sage and also omg I love ur hair and fit I can tell u would be a nice person to be around loll </3
does anybody actually say 'psstt' tho?? i just go 'hey! hey! hey you!'
Not the Peter Pan fit

Why can’t real life be like asmr role play videos? Free tingles, everyone is calm, doctors,teachers, even snappy receptionists are so chill and relaxing. Positive vibes, compliments, and just fun times 🥲 no worries in the world
I’m allergic to bubble yum but that’s okay!!🤔
Mds eu super seria sua amiga na escola
Not jocie biting the gum before chewing it fyi no shade long time sub luv your content
The teacher: No fidget toys or Drawing on someone else’s face.   The kids in the back:
You are just so beyond adorable - inside and out ❤
Blank space!!                         Have a wonderful night! Don’t forget to eat!!
The fact that I have a pimple there surprised me😮

Hello I love your videos and ASMR
This literally felt like a normal day at the alternative school I went to. Like my friend did my makeup in class one time because why not and this video reminded of that tbh
This is a reminder for everyone:  Did you brush your teeth? Did you do your skincare routine?  Did you wash your face?  Did you take your makeup off?  Are you wearing Pajamas?  Did you say Goodnight or I love you to your loved ones?  Thank you Jocie for an amazing video! Goodnight Everyone! <3 sleep well

Ooo she got the good pens
THE HAIR ❤❤❤
Hi
jocie: "sshh, keep your voice down"  also jocie: **VIOLENT RUMMAGING THROUGH BAG**
Grl I have the same pimple patches as you!⭐️
The fact that if Jocie is an "elf" that means are we elfs?
Oh I sure have a lot if pimples if I need like five stars lol, but amazing video!
This fit/look for the vid reminded me of either shaggy, or peter pan and im living for it
Anybody else kinda miss the less main stream Jocie? Like she’s still the same lovable calm type but it’s just not the same for some reason.
Wanna know the best feeling on earth? After you’ve had a long day u come home , get comfy and watch one of Jocie’s videos ❤
1:35 ik it’s a rp but the “ Y’know what , I’m to pretty for this “ is the most relatable thing I’ve seen all week ❤❤😂
nah bruh she got 2 comments on YouTube
Yt randomly spawned in the comments 👈😀👉
this is the best video ever
THESE ARE THE BEST PENS i'm super jealous 💗💗
Notice how she only has 1 pimple patch but we have like 50
Pls do more of these ! This is my fav asmr video
I cannot physically possibly whisper , like its impossible for me

This is the same exact video as edafoxx asmr "the girl in the back of the class draws on your face" down to the wording in the beginning and reactions and laughing edafoxx's came out before jocie's so atleast give credit if you copy someone
I literally can't sleep till I listen to this video!
This feels like I’m actually here….I love it
I was nearly asleep, but then you pulled out the stickers and I got so excited to look at them that I forgot what I was trying to do lmao

18:14 (for me)
Awesome❤
You and Gibi are my favorite ASMR people
Love from India 🇮🇳dear 😚
Reminded me of the time back in elementary school when this kid I used to sit with would draw on my arm or my hand (depending on what place I was comfortable with) and we would swap stickers with each other and pretend they were earrings (this was 1-2 grade) it was really fun but now I’m stuck with finals in middle school 🙁
This is the friend no one asked for, but the friend we all NEED
GURL WHO EATS GUM LIKE THAT
L                                                                   L
The hair and ears give total frodo vibes and I'm living for it.

I wanted to watch this so bad but I couldn’t get past the gum sounds 😫 it may be fine for other people but one of my pet peeves is hearing people smack or chew so this was a no for meeeee but still so good from what bit I watched!

Jocie “I’m too pretty for this” Me: *cackles SO LOUD* Jocie “keep your voice down”  Me :”sorry my bad”
Every class I have is half this time but I still love every video she makes😂 😁
"you know what I'm to pretty for this" lol
Plot twist: we're in a teachers meeting, the other teachers never say anything because we're the student favorites and they cant afford for us to quit.
the amount of times Jocie said "whatever" in this video😂too cute💘
Ima walk out of class and be the most coolest and fashionable girl in school now 😌
Bro I just realized Jocie spent 20 minutes putting stickers on our face- that’s how you know she’s dedicated on anther level lol
Psst at my one more time 👺.            0:49
I adore you. I felt like we were literally best friends sitting in the back of the classroom. Such an authentic, believable presence you have. Thank you for existing in this world with me. ❤

SHE ALWAYS ASKS FOR CONSENNTTTTTT- 😍😍😍😍✨✨✨

ANYWAY if you got this far i hope you know how loved you are. this took me a rlly long time btw, byeeeeee💕

What happend to your hair Jocie ???? (I'm sorry if you had cancer)  :(   :(
I looove your new haircut so much 😭😭
Who's the idiot outside with the car. With the loudest dang engine.
It’s not “a gross green” it’s lovely and it’s called chartreuse.
This really give school kind of vibes! It's like the "Chaotic careless kid" in class vibe. It's really in character haha! Very great! I really love it. It makes my day :) ❤️. I love the fact that every asmr videos you make is always so in character.
Yessss girl you look absolutely  ✨STUNNING ✨ before and after
I mean this with all love 😂😂 and idk why but I get like secret low key mean girl vibes from this character like “stop paying attention to class to talk to me. I know, let me draw on your face 👀👀👀 I’m not saying you need it but I have pimple patches 😭😭😭” don’t get me wrong, I’m here for it but is this just me???
i actually got excited thinking I had a new friend who was right there but she isn’t right there she’s on the other side of the world
thankyou peter pan

One thing that’s very entertaining about this is the fact Jocie stuck with the role play looking at the teacher, talking about the notes, and all the triggers reminded me of school. I noticed the setup as well. This is so good! Jocie you’re amazing! You always help me fall asleep! 💕

Hello
Your haircut is so pretty, we've missed you and love all your videos
I love the new hair!! The whole look is giving me gender envy lol, and I also love the earing 💞💃✨
"I'm too pretty for this," is my general response to most things.
I haven’t seen any comments asking or addressing the elf ears… like stellar video but my brain keeps being like is… is she wearing elf ears? Why? Is this elf school!?? I’m on board with any option.
🥰 super cute! I just realized how much I love the word “stickers” 😂
Giving me Peter Pan vibes, the shorter hair, elf ears and shirt! This was a really fun video thank you Jocie for your content!
I felt like I was a kid in school again. Things seemed easier. Thanks Jocie!
Are u gay?
Why is this so accurate though
Hi Jocie! Love all of your videos 💕 where did you buy your pens??
Wait, I like my stickers stick- 😴
Cassiopia is a pretty magnificent name :0 (Cassyopia... kasiopia....? Whatever-)

The "mind your business" was my favorite part lol super cute. Great watch. Thank you for creating.
Your hair looks amazing! I wish I could pull that off! Also I have the same mark on my chin.
I was struggling to sleep, your video helped me a lot! Thank you! <3 Your hair look really pretty! :0 I'm a huge fan, but I don't comment often ^^"

👋 This was cool. I hate ASMR videos, however I like the personal feel of a Jr high locker room!  So much fun back then, good memories! 👍 you have good manners,  wild ideas and you're not afraid of COLOURS! So much fun today ☺️ I like you and your imagination! Keep on keeping on,  be you! Thanks so much for this video! ❤️  Best Wishes,  yep, I'm a boomer! (But young at heart) BTW, I dig yer ears! 😉
"you know what? i.. am too pretty for this" 😆 MOOD
Am I the only one who alway thought for like a whole year that she looks like Doja?
This video by Far felt like the most REAL experience I've ever had with you. Such a beautiful and genuine soul you have. ❤️ I would also like to note that it is abundantly clear that you took in the advice given in your viewers' feedback from the series of trigger tests that you did in a few videos back & you have grown even stronger as a content creator because of it, love Victoria ❤️
Can we have another one like this please!  Classroom asmr
This gives me fancy Peter Pan vibes. I love it. Btw, what are your pronouns? ;^; I thought that maybe along the new haircut, you found new pronouns that are more fitting for yourself. But it's just a possibility, not trying to insinuate anything. Just tryna be respectful, please do not get this wrong TvT ❤✨
I'm already 24, but this asmr brings me right back to grade school. It was a better time.
You are so beautiful and ur new hair style really suits u❤️❤️
Your curly girl method please🙏
I LIKE YOU'R HAIR BESTYYYY

There are so many crunchy, satisfying sounds in this video it is perfect for background study sounds! and the whispering is really soothing and not distracting at all :)
The time for judgement is here. Repent of your sins while you can. Soon it will be too late.. I have warned you time and time again. This time is the last..
Honestly I watched the first minute with my phone muted, your hair and face did nothing for me. I can't believe how bored and lonely random people on the internet are. 😐

I HAD TWO OF THOSE PENS I HAD A GREEN AND ORANGE ONE BUT THEY WERE KINDA GROSS CUZ I ATOLE THEM OFF THE SCHOOL FLOOR
AH I LOVE YOUR HAIR! I cut mine to a similar length around a month ago (I cut off eighteen inches and donated it) and I think it was one of the best choices I’ve made.   As always this is a wonderful video! You’re my favorite ASMR YouTuber and I love your videos. Keep up the amazing work💙
“you know what im too pretty for this” CACKLING ST THAT FOR SOME REASON
Idk y but this is like buddy the elf meets a lost boys style and I’m here for it 😂❤👏🔥
Doesn’t Jocie and Nancy wheeler look similar or is it just me?
I normally don’t like gum chewing but the way you did it made it seem more like mouth smacking noises and not chewing so it was nice. I love the hair cut I thought it was a hairstyle at first and I was so confused hahaha
Heres a blank screen sleep well my peeps                                                                         Good night love ya ♡~♡

With the best of love…you look like a character from my favorite Childhood movie. Rizzo from Grease. I really think you should do a 1960’s theme as her for Halloween 🎃 Just an idea!! The new haircut suits you well and gives me nostalgia of a time I can’t get back. Thank you for being a lifesaver on multiple accounts. I wouldn’t still be here today if your soft whispers didn’t lull me to sleep on the hardest of nights. I wish I could repay your kindness. With love 💕
i  want those earings.

Hiiii Jocie, I'm from Brazil and I'm such a fan of your channel and your community is so amazing! Could you please do a asmr with closed eyes, you know,  follow my instructions and that kind of stuff... Thank you so much for doing my life so much better❤
Ahhh a shoutout from my very first fave ASMRist (Jocie) to a newer fave (Edafoxx!) for some reason it makes me so happy that we watch the same kind of ASMR 😊
This one was so fun and creative! A little different from what we usually see on your channel but seriously just as amazing as all of your past videos.

I love to see more creators with short hair! (I mean like actually short, not like shoulder length) I have really short hair that I love, but I never see it in media since it's not like part of the beauty standard for women. You look amazing!
JOCIE I LOVE YOUR HAIR ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

JFEOIJEGOIFS OH MY GOD HAIR IS CUT CUT HER HAIR SHE'S SO PRETTY IT LOOKS SO GOOD AGHHHHHHHH
I adore your hair!
Absolutely love the new professional jocie! But today I saw very little glimpse of the old jocie with same haircut who started her journey some 4 years ago with her tiny little mic making the most goofy and cheerful video for fun and maybe trying to do make-up tutorial I really really miss her it's not that this jocie isn't good she is just more mature and professional now
She looks so much like Nancy from Stranger things.❤️

everyone's talking about Jocie's hair, but is not one going to talk about how cute her elf ears are? and also she made them blend in with her ears so well with those accessories and stuff that at first I didn't even know those were fake and thought she actually did surgery to make her ears pointy. but anyways cute ears!

Hi Jocie! I just want to say that the effort you put in to create an environment people feel safe and comfortable in is noticed and appreciated! the small things like asking for permission to do things is extremely special and a trademark of you.❣

Your hair and face. It’s giving Tinker bell and Millie Bobby Brown. This video is so relaxing! 💖⭐️🍃🌼  I usually don’t like gum chewing in ASMR. But, the way Jocie does it. It’s actually a nice sound to hear. I adore you Jocie!! <3  My top 3 fav ASMRTIST’S are  Jocie, of course  Edafoxx ASMR  Chynaunique asmr  And many more amazing asmrtist’s too. But, these are the three I listen to often. ＼（＾▽＾）／
