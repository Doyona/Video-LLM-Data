LYRICS: I wanna drink Wanna think Write a song about it I wanna smoke, Make a joke, Try to hide the damage,  I wanna drive this car Right over the edge Of every bad idea I didn’t have yet, I look at you Look at me Feeling kinda tragic, Dazed and confused, Hard to see, Where we lost the magic, I never meant to be hypocritical, This fucking crazy ride’s left me cynical,   just like that, I know there’s no turning back, We already made this bed, And I can’t even sleep in it,   Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast, And kill me slow, Try to forget you Gotta pretend to  Til I hit an all-time low, Once in a life time, Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you, Gotta pretend to, I Hope a heart only breaks this bad, Once in a Lifetime    I try to run Try to hide Just forget about it, I tell myself Every night I could live without it, I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness, But every time I do I make another mess,   just like that, I know there’s looking back, We already made this bed, And I can’t even sleep in it,   Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast, And kill me slow, Try to forget you Gotta pretend to  Til I hit an all-time low, Once in a life time, Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you, Gotta pretend to, I Hope a heart only breaks this bad, Once in a Lifetime

50 years old balding and still singing about teenage girls...
bro what album what this song on?
They are fucking spectacular ❤❤❤
2024
Nostalgia man
they sound sm diff now but i still love them n their new music
This is just bad! It’s like they want to look like Everclear but they suck!
db4d, that was the rock my kids babysitterwas lookinng for, id rather live in the house neest door. that place is good for clowns, brat, tax breaks....and music videos it would seem. good for you ATL
bravo!!!!
😞
They sound so different!  The emo band I loved wasn't an all time low, you can turn back!!! The 00's had the most amazing sounds. I won't forget you-- I'll never forget you. I'll still sleep in that bed.
These guys are killing it, Also living the Rock lifestyle it feels like you are the impact of being the most popular rock band in history  I wish I could see them on tour and live that rock lifestyle too I hope they would make more Rock songs, the fact is listening to All Time Low at any time. #RockHits #AllTimeLow #VEVORock #EverythingThatRocks
This sounds like 5 Seconds of Summer. I thought it would be a Talking Heads cover. Lol
1:47, ah yes finally they sing their band name HAHA 😂❤
thank you for hold and keeping ring=er
Bell how cum you didn't play and help walter from deep depression...he spread trying to reach i sis-stepper
this is not my beautiful house THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE
Omg I forgot about this song!!!!! I love this shit. I totes don't apologize to the neighbors that had to watch me sit in that car jamming out with volume up allllllll the way.
Great song! Heard this on slicethepie!!! LOVE THIS SONG!!
PARCE LOS MEJORESS !!!
bruh what is this silliness sharing a name with Talking Heads' classic?
This song and PMA should have been on Tell me I am live or once-in-a-lifetime should have Been the main song instead tell me I am alive.
best song never gets old❤
can we just appreciate the fact that their playing in a living room
Future heart is insane but  I love the nothing personal album ❤️
I love "Tell Me I'm Alive" just wonder why this song wasn't on the album  Maybe it didn't fit  LOVE ATL anyway
MISS THIS SO MUCH ! :'>>>
still an amazing band!!!  emo forever
Nice!
I guess it was not the same as it ever was
I love all time low but on this one their music definitely outshined the video,
i suppose if ya like it ya like it, and good on ya. Bores me senseless though, tbh. Clearly not for, or about, me.
I’m the only person ik at my age who loves all time low. IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE WHOS 17 AND LITERALLY LOVES THIS BAND AS MUCH AS I DO 🙏🙏🙏
Fuck yea boys! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
alex❤😊😍
me encanta esta musica
Thanks, Madison @siriusxm, for playing ATL often this Sunday. I discovered a new speaker workout with this one.
My dear sweet Chris💔
From 1 second in, to the last second I'm FUCKING PUMPED!!!!!
How has it been a year already?
Music videos be like. Look how excited this commoner is to be in a mansion.
I love this song
Ewww..
Dang can’t stop listening to this song. So good. Only 2 million Views is criminal.
I love the oh, sh¡t! At the end lol
Made in 2021, but sounds like 2003
THEY SAID IT THEY SAID IT
Abosolutely fantastic first time i listened to all the words and actully watched the video you guys are better than ever . 💎
This won’t be the last song for All Time Low for the ages with every bit of this album and I love it. 🤘🏾😛🤘🏾
Seriously?,only 2 million views?,this song deserve minimum 100 millions
Quebec Soon !!👍 Laval
Lyrics:  And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack And you may find yourself in another part of the world And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife And you may ask yourself, "Well... how did I get here?"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?" And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?" And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house" And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was  Water dissolving and water removing There is water at the bottom of the ocean Under the water, carry the water Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again, into the silent water Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  And you may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?" And you may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?" And you may ask yourself, "Am I right? Am I wrong?" And you may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again, into the silent water Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was and look where my hand was Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Letting the days go by, same as it ever was  Here a twister comes, here comes the twister Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM LIVE IN THE PHILLIPINES AGAIN AND TO PLAY THIS SONG FOR US
iloveyouuu 😭
🧡❤💜💙
If you want to know the girl in this video ,its sofie rovenstine
Unbelievable the fact you guys still make music, LOVE IT
When I saw y'all made a new song I ended up squealing and jumping up and down please continue to make music!! 💜💜💜💜
Anyone know the actors cause that guy pretty cute
I'm so proud of yall. Clear your names like yall are doing. I have been waiting a literal lifetime to come to a concert.
Takes me back to 2010
I LOVE YOU
I hope they do Crosseyed and Painless next!
Love this song
it sounds odd
They played this at Iheart radio Alter Ego 2022 just last weekend and I'm just blown away by their performance!!!
🖤💜
he said the thing!
I love that their music matured with them. It’s very hard to do that and they were able to keep the nostalgia while also making it fun and appealing to their audience that’s about 24-30 years old. I have the song on repeat 😭🔥❤️
Really Good 👍underrated Band.
Happy Birthday Alexander William Gaskarth!\m/❤🤘🎸🎤
Ntapp, mantapp mantapppp💯💯
Tantos años y aun siguen emocionandome cmo en el principio. La misma sensacion que en los años pasados y su esencia no cambia en lo absoluto! Son los mejores!!🥺.
Easily my 2021 anthem, can't stop playing it!!!
This is one if the best song i herd this year 😎
Here because of Humanoid farewell video
All Time Low couldn't make a shit song even if they tried. Making epic, good songs just comes naturally to them!!
🍀2021.11.29 필레이리스트🐰❤
lol..Im 60..and loving this...... still punky...but for me I like the matured sound and production...... just coz ya get old...... ya should still love to rock !!
Damn puberty hit him like a truck he sounds soo different now
Yellowcard Ocean Avenue - rip off...  Lame 😒 #posergeneration
Goosebump
cool
and then sometimes you will love someone with all you have , but that doesn't mean they have to love you back ...
Current kids "wow this band is dope"   People in their 30's: 😭😭😭
This song gives me life
I hope a Heisenberg breaks this bad once in a lifetime.
The first love high school feels come crawling back!
Bold of All Time Low to cover a Talking Heads song, but interesting take!
LETTING THE DAYS GO BYYY
久しぶりにATLを聴いたけど、この曲めっちゃ好きです アルバム聴いたらbasement noiseも良かった
Wait,this is not Talking Heads.
I can't stop listening... It's fitting the mood so right!
Whoops wrong once in a lifetime
This is not my beautiful house!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷
They should have called The song ‘All time low - All time low’  Get lost J Bellion! 😬
This song popped up on an Amazon music Playlist.  I couldn't believe that it was All Time Low.  I never cared for them, but this song is 🔥!
All time low still continuing their authentic punk vibe in their nowadays music makes me bawl in joyful tears i love them so much
Max really did a good job on this video.  This song is also insanely good!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The brunette looks like rachel bilson…..
I finally heard all time low on the radio since 2008 lol
I loved y’all until y’all talk shit on trace when all he did was help y’all
a mixture of the new angels and airwaves song "losing my mind" and simple creatures "one little lie" would be cool.
Cant wait to see these guys in oct.
This isn't the once in a lifetime I remember
Why’s nobody talking about how that’s not their house? I’ve watched this 30 times and I’m just realizing
Absolute banger for sure!
The lyrics: heartbreak and agony The video: lol hOuSe PaRtY
The Intern, Ben leaves a market and notices a flyer with a job proposition. He fulfills job requirements sends it to employer. First day in the office, when he goes for a job interview. It is full of computers, fashion, software developers work with other employees in a same shared area. Their computers screens is full with PHP HTML code and SQL queries.
Soft
Pretty wild I been a fan of these boys since I was 14.   I’m 30 now.
Great song but the video doesn’t match the flow of the song🙃.
Anyone know the name of the girl in this music video?
okay so lemme get this straight: this an old song that they might have drawn inspiration from for their band name hence the all time low lyric, and then they rerecorded it?
I feel like this video doesn't match the lyrics Alex is singing
This song makes me feel like it's early 2000. Not a bad thing at all lol you guys rock!
Alex is goin to be rapper 😥
I was hoping this would be a Talking Heads cover.  Oh well.  Back to the Talking Heads song
i thought this was gonna be a talking heads cover ☹️
Just saw these boys live. They were great. :)
I was sorely disappointed by the lack of G-man
I’m commenting on this every day until I’m over my break up
Terrible
The chorus sounds like So Wrong it’s Right
Something about Alex’s melodies reminds me of spearmint gum, and the color white, and candy
I made a comment 3 months ago about how this song hits too good to be a breakup song. Then,  July 1st, it became MY breakup song. So hey, thanks ATL, for getting me through the hardest shit my heart has ever felt. And all of the other stuff. For the last 15 years.
Letting the days go by! Let the water hold me down...  Oops wrong video sorry
I gotta say this is the worst Talking Heads cover I've ever heard. It's like you guys didn't even try to play the song.
Hey look it's my entire existence in a song
Jodidamente hermoso 😭❤️❤️
Def better than PMA
Damn that's some good music. Plugged into my home theater system, turned it up, and it made the hairs on my arm stand up (wearing a half cast on broken wrist though, so now it itches like hell) totally worth it
This isn’t David Byrne
and you may find yourself
Thanks you with all my heart! This song has taken me 10 years ago! Don’t change the style because this rocks!
Heard this on the radio.  Can’t get over it.
And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack And you may find yourself in another part of the world And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife And you may ask yourself, "Well... how did I get here?"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?" And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?" And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house" And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was  Water dissolving and water removing There is water at the bottom of the ocean Under the water, carry the water Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again, into the silent water Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  And you may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?" And you may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?" And you may ask yourself, "Am I right? Am I wrong?" And you may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"  Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again, into the silent water Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground  Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was and look where my hand was Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Letting the days go by, same as it ever was  Here a twister comes, here comes the twister Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by
So, did he know where the key was because he had done work in someone's house, invited a bunch of friends over and partied then left a mess behind? If so, not cool.
yet another amazing song that reminds me of where i want to be in life. cheers to yall!
These guys have been around since i was in highschool nice to see they are finally seeing mainstream success. Hard to believe their first radio hit was monsters. 2004 feels like a life time ago but good job guys. Keep making music.
I can't believe how good All Time Low has always been and continues to be. The songs they compose are just great bangers and are amazing to hear/see in concert! Love All Time Low 💛
THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL ONCE IN A LIFE TIME
Great band still making great music !!! Saw ATL twice...in 2009 at Six Flags in Massachusetts and in 2011 at Oakdale Theatre in Connecticut.
“ A heart only breaks this bad
I hope a heart only breaks this bad, once in a lifetime.
I’m proud to say my gym played one of  all time low songs
0:39 like the ranch owner's car in Shaun The Sheep
Once in a lifetime never the right Time Take it Fast and Kill Me Slow

Beware of guy with undies :D
26 years old and I’ve been a fan since 14!! This makes me feel young again!!!
Jon bullion would be proud that his song all time low is a band now.
4000 month!! For “Life” Sounds amazing  She’s manifesting!! Epic!!
Absolutely well crafted pop song awesome
This is not my Talking Heads music video!
this isnt talking heads
Best song you have done, I know that's personal preference, but it's been on a loop for days 🙂
Les recomiendo DAYGLOW MEDICINE❤🖤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The winning lotto tix stuck between him and her.... best symbolism I've seen
This used to be my favorite band    It still is :)
Pop punk is never dead
Has the sound of 15 years ago... good times, great song.
Even after all this time they still keep getting better and better thank you for this ❤️
Que banda ❤️🇧🇷
At my age this song is great. I dance around the house or in my car singing it!
I had plenty of pop-punk songs to get me through breakups as a teen. Going through a break up as an adult sucks worse BUT it does mean things song hits the spot even more 😂
good
Ll
When 2:24 dropped It brought me back to Nothing Personal.
I love All Time Low. Good band. Fucking great band
Letting the days go by...
Definitely Once in a lifetime ❤🔥🙌

💜 Yes.
yeah ok holy shit this is hitting me right in the chest how does their music always do this to me
Man saw them live when i was in highschool a decade ago. They still killing it wtf
💗💗💗💗💗
1 Peter 5:7 “Turn all your anxiety over to God because he cares for you.” Jesus loves you dont give up on him!❤! Jesus is coming back soon live4him🙏❤
Same as it ever was
I'm crying. Everytime I listen to a new ATL song, and I'm back to my teenage sitting in the corner of my room with just their music helping me steer my course. I've seen some very dark days and had Alex and gang reminding me of my place home. Love you guys!
Peter Griffin: he did it!
Man these guys use to be so good, now it just sounds like Disney original music
am I the only one who think that that curly guy kinda looks like younger version of machine gun kelly?
Ladies and gentlemen, rock is making a comeback! 🤘🎸
And you may ask yourself, "Wait, this isn't Talking Heads?"
bleached hair, catchy song, two white teen falling in love, algorithm says...yes.
The early 2000s called, they want their boy band back. ;)
I’m not digging it. But I’m not hating lol 😂
after 13 years  this song brings back memories
This song is 🔥 Makes me nostalgic for the emo life I never lived 😭
❤️❤️❤️
Damn, the fellas are killing it
"And you may find yourself-"  Wait this isn't talking heads
Punk’s not dead 🤘🎸⚡️
I LOVE THIS SONG 😭❤️ feels so nostalgic i'm cryin
GERALD ANDERSON lang malakas 🤣💪
Great summer vibe!
I Still Want 🤔... A Remembering Sunday Music Vid... If possible. Please been loving you all sense I was 13 and I'm 26 now. I know you get lots of comments but this is one of all of your fans favorites Please. 💞
Y’all kill it with the straight bangers🤟💯💯🔥❤️
I saw them live for their Future Hearts Album Tour, and this band is SO worth it. Their music is amazing and they are just as amazing if not MORE amazing live.
This is the most 2010 thing to ever come out this year
This Song Always Takes Me Back To My Childhood
This song is garbage. Please stop abusing my ears. So annoying and repetitious, vocals are grating,what little melody there is is cliche and uninspired. No hook at all and the lyrics are just lame af.
A lot of comments about the name drop, but none about the fun little "OH SH-" at the end when she wins on the lottery. 😂
Google...
Damn. ATL never disappoints. Killed it harder
Meh
❤️
Thanks for uploading. If you have a minute come check out our music videos - We're an independent rock band and think you may dig our tracks. Appreciate it.
ATL one of the few bands still making that pop punk music that we love after all these years.
Damn might🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, ITS NOT RELATED TO THE TOP TIER TALKING HEADS "ONCE IN A LIFETIME"
How did I not hear this until now!  that was amazing in every way, vocals and the lyrics, music, Alex's voice sounded wonderful. I think he's at the top of his vocals, he just gets better than with every new song.  Mention all time low in the song, the kind of things I like about them, little nuances. I would put on my reason for vacation, I think Myself deserving Off....a little time off.  nobody asked what was that about?
I love that guitar rift at the end. It’s so nostalgic.
I thought these guy cover Talking Head, but they just stole the name, disappointed
MAN THIS SONG IS SO GOOD THAT I TURN UP MY RADIO WHEN THIS SONG COMES ON!!!
All Time Low! Always killin it with every release so we don't just get great songs ONCE IN A LIFETIME :)
Shoutout to my government teacher for playing this in class
who is the girl in this video pls i need to know
This should be a Simple Creatures song..
Is it that difficult to write a song without an F word?
missing hanging out with my friends so bad.. hope pandemic is getting over soon
Beautifull girl... Name?
This has an early 2000s vibe and I’m here for it!
I really missed the sound of guitars in new music
Disliking a good perfect band is a “Once In A Lifetime!” 🤣
Those old time brothers! Brings me back to tears thank you!
kaway kaway sa mga pilipino
You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack and you may find yourself on the wrong youtube video
The ad for this song was "The Wrecks" I Want My Life Back Now and the algorithm did a good job putting that ad on here u guys should check it out.

I came from the felt emo again video lmao. So glad they’re still making music.
I'm 25 now and I've been listening to ATL since I was 15, and I pretty much watched every single MV's, Live Concerts, BTS's, Band Interviews of them. I feel old now.
🖤
Met Jack at Wits End in Deep Ellum in Dallas.. Badass guy. Good to see you guys are still kickin' it thru this bullshit pandemic.
till i hit an all-time-low roll credits...
i was 14 im 25 now
Amazing!
I hope this is a shift back to emo/punk music being a thing again.
Dude in the truck looks like Richard Ramirez a little bit lol
This vibes hard! Also All Time Low is one of my favorite Pop Punk bands of all time!
IMAGINE WHAT THIS SONG WILL BE LIKE LIVE. IMAGINE THE ENERGY AT 2:35 LIVE !!!
I miss you guys I am very glad that you guys are back.
That girl looks like from the emo guy video.
Amazing song! I heard you guys on the radio in Moscow
I’m 20 and have been listening to this band since I was 13-   God where did all the years go honestly-  Im still that angsty punk kid, that’s for sure lol.
"Til I hit an all-time low"  This band always make me days up! Since 2010. Now 2021, Indonesia.
Sweet!!!
Could not take a talking heads name, maybe
Her smile 😊
I don’t like how the video has absolutely nothing do to with the lyrics of the song. I was hoping to see something similar to how this song makes me feel.
Really good video and sound production really catchy all time low your sounding alot better! Had to grow older and gain character I see
THIS ISN'T DEAR MARIA.
This really gives me early 2000s vibes
More power
This makes me miss the HS life and the ultimate teen angst that I never had.
Tbh, no
It doesn't sound much like All time low.. :/
YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF,
what a great song
Love from Bangladesh <3
water flowing underground
🖤🖤🤘
Los amo pedazos de gatos ♥
Wait, this isn't my beautiful house! This isn't my beautiful wife!
Classic all time low
wait this isn't Talking Heads
including "all time low" in the lyrics makes me feel like I've heard this before lol
This is Dear Maria 3.0. I'm in love.
And here i am , study for a world that has a mask on with or without corona
This reminds me of high school in 03
SAME AS IT EVER WAS
This is not my beautiful house This is Not my beautiful wife!
Evet aşık olunası bir şarkıı
Böyle şeyler keşfettiğim için kendimle gurur duyuyorum🦋
😍😍😍
This band NEEDS more recognition
피3 노래듣다 여기까지 와버렸다...
HE DID IT! HE SAID THE THING!
Heard this song for the first time today. Had no idea how I’d be listening to it over and over again
Harry potter?
Great song!
This is catchy, makes me smile because of the tune but the lyrics break my heart all at the same time 💔
This isn't talking heads wtf
감스트보다 여기까지왔군
Damn rock is so trash now lol
love it, can't get this out my head :D
0:56 THE NAME DROPPPPPPPPPPP
So sad that this kind of genre of this songs are less nowadays.
this is painful I'm sorry but just keep whining
this band is so lit
You ever listen to a song for the first time and think its pretty banging, but you werent consuming the lyrics critically so you listen to it again  and then when you hear it. you burst into tears because it hits this button in your soul too hard and too fast and you spend the rest of the song sobbing?  yeah. that happened. thanks. it gave me feelings. <3
Just heard this on the radio today and I was really impressed. They've really reinvented themselves well
once in a life time, water flowing underground
You guys kill it been listening to your guys for long time be eve gonna stop listening yal definitely do get better and better.
Did you just rip off a motion city soundtrack song? "Son of a gun"
God this song hits too good to be a breakup song smh
I never knew how much I needed this in my life. But now I definitely know. Still listening #alwayslisteningtoalltimelow
How old do i feel realizing I’ve listened to All Time Low for 13 years..
THIS IS SO CATCHY OH MY GOD
Really hit me hard this, I've been struggling in my mid 20s. This song  has   brought me back that youthful spirit I once had, I need to move forward with positivity. Great song 👌
Same as it ever was
did a spotify radio of old songs like Check Yes Juliet and this randomly popped up and fell in love at the first listen... and found out it was released just 3 weeks ago. might have to listen to the album
It's so weird to listen to them after I haven't for a few years. I remember listening to Put Up or Shut Up on vinyl and boy oh boy have they changed.
I genuinely thought that was Ariel on the intro from the Emo's Not Dead videos lmao
My emo phase never left
You guys are timeless I hope you keep putting out music and I can't wait to see you live.
American Pie XXIIII theme song que now
BOP
I never forget what all time low is about 💓💓💓🥰👍 Love and respect 💓
New" song!!
No matt cutshall cameo?
I wish rock and punk rock back to mainstream:(
Terbaikk ATL 💪🏻
who the fuck is down voting this
oh shi..
damn we need more like this
Masterpiece
My favorite band since I was a kid
Great song
They're BACK!
Damn! the lyrics and the beat! EMO IS NOT DEAD! :D
Atl forever ❤️
This went to...  Hey, ed Novak,  The homeless guy who chose to live in my garage vs a guest room so he wouldn't cost me, is returning home, from Arizona, to Massachusetts, Sunday morning, to see his children; 2 sons and his grandchildren. I found him homeless in Bullhead City, Arizona's. Splash park. He is singularly unique and highly intelligent. I'd like to hear anyone who loves Philip Thompson, was waiting for him on the platform, when he arrived. Mr. Novak, how about getting your hands dirty? Can we not see my man, sponsored?  Lead by example. This is how winners play. Do not breakdown in my f'ing town because I will see you home safe. Let's put our backs into this, shall we?  We are supposed to love our neighbor. Tell me, who drew the lines? Anything for a loved one. Anything for a stranger. "You should never speak to stranger". Mr. Novak, this man is a human being and he is dear to me, as well as THE GUARDIAN FOUNDATION and CATHOLIC CHARITIES.   Regards,  Sparechange  RES# 1D2A91-15APR21 Philip Thompson  Invisible human being Outdoor institutionalized  It is learned behavior. I contend, it may be unlearned.
I like how this comes out and like I'm dealing with something lol
NEW ALBUM ??
Min 2:12 Alex melts me when he says : "Justttt likeeee thatttt" 😍♥️🤤
Is it just me that fell a Emarosa vibe?
Remembered all those emo days 😥😥🤘🤘
Remember seeing these cats open for FOB years ago. Just getting better and better.
My sister kept asking me over and over again if I had heard this song yet. Now that I have, I regret not listening to her earlier. This song is awesome.
this is shit
Yey! Another great song!

Another BANGER from ATL! 🤘🖤😯
This feels like when they say the movie title in the movie
I love how this is a friendship song💚 and not a romantic one, I was like oh no they are going to kiss and no, I was pleasantly surprised
They... They did the thing!!! :D
Love it!
And you may ask yourself, "Well... how did I get here?"
Reminds me of some early/mid-2000s alternative!  About damn time we got some kick ass music again!!
I’ve been listening to you guys for at least a decade and I’m so happy you guys are getting the recognition you deserve!!
Where tf is my beautiful house
Hits right in the feels and makes me remember when I was still a young idyllic kid. Thank you ATL for this nostalgic hit!
this song much show, i from brazil fan this band
I’m not gonna lie, I squealed like a fan boy when I heard the Name drop in this song for the first time!
Road to 1M!♥️
felt like this song was a reminisce of their past songs.
Watching the video to this song: :) Listening to the lyrics to this song: :(
Wait where's bill nye
Well, it’s cool to hear All Time Low singing all time low
I'll tell my future kids I was here before million views
I thought the album Wake Up Sunshine was too good to be true, then this drops. I'm ready for whatever is next.
No I want another so wrong it’s right album.
The model of this video is Ashley Graham`s  skinny version.
Thsi is a summer pop right here
😖🥺❤️❤️
This is not my beautiful Talking Heads song???
I love this so much but I can only listen to it when my grandma isn't home cause I'm not allowed to listen to any music I actually like anymore :(((
So damn good!!!!!
This is the first song of theirs I’ve heard and I’m already obsessed!
IT'S NOT A PHASE, MOM!
I need to find a friend group like them...
The chorus hits. 🤘 great lyrics too.
BLONDE ALEX IS SUPREMACY..
I heard this song last Saturday.  I love it.  Reminds me of an old lover.
is that hannah stocking?
Great song. Keep up the good work!
Ok. But you also may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
Yay all time low is back in business
let's talk about another thing than the name drop
Another brilliant song added to the list "what Louis Tomlinson probably likes and gonna cover it"
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
I already made this bed..... And I can't even sleep in it
😎🤘🇮🇩
This is gonna be a hit first time i listen and loving it
I mean its no dear maria 🤷‍♂️
Taking the most hardcore shit rn on the toilet bumping my head up and down..that's how good this is 😩🔥.
They said "All time low"  Roll the credits
oh my god okay it’s happening everybody stay calm what’s the procedure stay f**KING CALM EVERYBODY JUST CALM THE F**K DOWN
This is dank
Dude I discovered this band through Demi Lovato's Monster Remix and had to say thank god I did. This is dope
does anyone knows who the boy and the girl are?
Is that Voyboy?
Love this song but idk what they did to the vocals but it doesn't sound like Alex and he naturally has such a beautiful voice
His voice changed 😁
He looks exactly like Chase Hooper, UFC fighter
Does anyone know who the actors are
LOVE the "All time low" part
New Found Glory be like “ahhh you finally said it back”
Have to do in you music in listen speak on radio tv ,and real in indonesia.. And understane lenguage.. To visit my on kejobong real central ,java indonesia real.. Aku ,harap kamu jumpa saya di indonesia..
Girl: OH SHI-  Top 5 moments before disaster
You keep me alive with this song. I wonder if you sing  Runaround Sue by Dion if you have the time. If not, its fine.
The punk not die
Damn this knocks
yay
*oH SHI-*
I was so prepared for the big sad to come. I'm glad it didn't 😌
Stuck in my head FOR DAYS. 🤟
Cool(I’m sorry never mind you just ripped off a Talking heads song name and put some Shit lyrics to it that’s not what I thought it was)
I may or may not have had this song on repeat for the last few days...you can't prove anything. <3
I'm gassed you guys are back I was a emo in 2005-2010 tbh but I love you guys 💯💯💙💙🙈🙈🙉🙉🙊🙊

One of the most underrated bands.
I heard this on Alternative rock radio today
Please make more songs! Your'e the OG's of 90's kids in PH 🇵🇭🇵🇭
Yo this song slaps. Thanks All Time Low for releasing a true banger 🤘
263 people are fucking crazy.  Love you guys, never break up. I'll die.  Forever fan of 12 years ❤❤
God bless heal and save you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKkX8lleNdo
Man, I fucking love this & the sneaky 'all time low' STOP😭
I freaking love this song😭🥺😍
It's a shame so many people out there are sleeping on All Time Low. They are really missing out.
they back!!! cool!!!
awesome
Why does ATL singing 'til I hit an All Time Low feel so illegal-
me encanta la canciooon <3
Mantap I love this song
still my fave band up until now, so proud 🥺 much love from PH 🇵🇭
Another banger.  Production quality is top-notch-- well done.
Someone wanna be my friend? 🥺
same as it ever was
Great song but reminds me of one you would see on people’s MySpace pages hahaha
So good!
every time i listen to this and i hear him say "till i hit an all time low" i go full suicide squad. THEY SAID THE NAME THEY SAID THE NAME
Please tour this summmer!!! I can’t wait to hear the songs from Wake Up Sunshine live.
Amazing like always guys
Ah yes. This is my jam.
All Time Low on Jimmy Kimmel- April 5th. Mark your calendars!
I LOVE YOU
Só pq eu falei que fazia tempo que não via mais nada novo do ali time low ai está gosto muito dessa banda a anos mais parece que mudaram um a sonoridade, mais ainda continua foda
Love This!
Great fun
A song that will come once in a lifetime. When everyone seems to hit an all time low cause of the pandemic. It came, Just like that.. :D
LETTING THE DAYS GO BY
Smh this is not the real once in a lifetime
The nothing personal vibes in this make me so happy
2:24 I can see myself in a concert screaming this at the top of my lungs "TIL I HIT AN ALL TIME LOW"!!!!!
i love all time low
This makes me RIDICULOUSLY happy.  I get giddy when *books* do the thing where the name of the book turns up. The name of a BAND hardly ever turns up in one of their songs!! Thank you, lads, this made my Month! 🙀😻
unliked it just so that I could like it again
Well, I didn't expect this to slap like it did. Kudos to y'all! I miss all my older favorite bands. Y'all just keep goin' ham. <3
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down Letting the days go by, water flowing underground Into the blue again after the money's gone Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Been listening to ATL since 2010 wow
Who else is in the “I misclicked looking for David Byrne” gang
Emo's not Dead!!
This is no talking heads
No. No. Never.
This feels like the most 2000s music video
Ugh yes! Needed this! ❤️❤️
is the next album called stereo or smth, cuz that'd be an awesome title, or does it refer to the stereo sound and I'm digging too deep
Reminds me of my ex boyfriend ♥️
I miss this much!!!
I still like the song i guess, might just be crazy but the sound is missing the "rough around the edges feel" that always used to be there. the last album had a lot of songs that felt the same, still the same awesome band but then i guess in editing the songs get refined to a point where I just don't feel the kick or the rush in the points of the song i feel like i should expect too.
<3
this song has SO MUCH summer vibe
I delete all social media for two weeks and that’s when ATL decides to drop and new song and video🤦🏻‍♀️
Bringin back those middle school vibes ... sitting on AOL spittin hot fire all night long over the computer and not saying shit to her in school the next day 🔥
Letting the days go by
YOOO THIS SMACKS!!! IT'S TIME TO BRING BACK EMO AND PUNK!
I like like like
all time low is my favorite band and here's why:
Dont know what happened to ATL but just dont like this one, missing the roots of ATL im a fan but just dont like this shift in sounds
Make Indie Rock GREAT Again!
Is sad summer still on?
same as it ever was
This song si fucking great
EVERY SONG MAKES ME FALL IN LOVE WITH THE BAND EVEN MORE
Monsters FT Demi Lovato please
"All time low shoutout themselves in their own song"  *insert obama meme*
ATL's ability to modernize their style and vibe without actually compromising the brand they've developed over the years is actually amazing. This song is awesome
I feel like my heart is breaking all over again. The lyrics really be hittin so damn hard. Ahhhhh
This video takes me back to 2011
ga pernah mengecewakan All Time Low
Anyone know who the girl in the video is
2021 is getting better and better.
I miss seeing them in concert 😭😭😭 miss my boyssss
Yessss babyyyy
Amazing song and zack's hair

Didn't they do a music video of breaking into a house and the getting arrested . . . Or am I thinking of a different band? It has familiar vibes nonetheless, just can't place from where
This is not talking heads...
WHO is the boy acting in the music video?!?! Please
Yes they say "all time low" we get it.... Now who is this girl in the red jacket cuz damn.
Sounds terrific.
Was that Rob from don broco wtf 😂
Banger
I was never really a fan of All Time Low, but I gotta admit this is rly good and extremely catchy.
listening to these guys makes me feel like I’m a teenager again
Message on point 😏😏😏
Mildly disappointed this isn't a cover of Once In a Lifetime by Talking Heads
love
Welcome to 2021 with All Time Low, they rocked and are as stylish as ever 🧑🏼
Omg, this song sooo addicted, and bring me back to my 14 years old
Hope this means more to come
There is someone I really really like. It turns out she likes me too. She came to my life like a blessing. I was happy. And just like that, she decided to leave. Now I am stuck.  She lead me here. Now I am all alone. I really dont know where to begin. Now at the exact same time, this song was released and I am listening to it to cope up with tbe pain and loneliness.
why is my inner teenager so happy with this ??? it's really good!!

Was worried but banger yes
I audibly squealed at the name drop... but why NOW after 18 years 😭

Is it just me or has all time low left their pop punk routes and went full pop? I mean this is really the same band that wrote dear Maria? It's a hard sell

Instant Goosebumps man!! Nothing but love and support from Argentina!

Finally a song that is not political.
dude imagine if the album is self-titled too lmao
Just PLEASE give us a release date for the new album already! We waited long enough we NEED a new album!

Once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime  I wanna drink Wanna think Write a song about it I wanna smoke Make a joke Try to hide the damage I wanna drive this car Right over the edge Of every bad idea I didn't have yet  I look at you Look at me Feeling kinda tragic Dazed and confused Hard to see Where we lost the magic I never meant to be hypocritical This fucking crazy rides left me cynical  Just like that I know there's no turning back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it  Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast And kill me slow Try to forget you Gotta pretend to 'Til I hit an all-time low  Once in a lifetime Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you Gotta pretend to I hope a heart only breaks this bad Once in a lifetime  I try to run Try to hide Just forget about it I tell myself Every night I could live without it I wanna say good-bye to the loneliness But every time I do, I make another mess  Just like that I know there's no looking back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it  Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast And kill me slow Try to forget you Gotta pretend to 'Til I hit an all-time low  Once in a lifetime Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you Gotta pretend to I hope a heart only breaks this bad Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime  Just like that I know there's no turning back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it

LOVE YOU GUYS THANK YOU LOADS YOUR TIMING IS IMMACULATE WITH THIS
Fucking love this song!!
Damn this song is such a bop
remember me with the guitar
yo
This is great ;)
I love All Time Low but I guess I understand those who complain abt sounding the same after years. People complain abt Pmore when they change their sound but I guess that band change their sound successfully and as an All Time Low fan, I guess I should also get noisy to tell that this band should try new sound. I like "Young Renegade" era. Dirty Laundry and Take Cover sound so different and it sink to me now like Ive been addicted to it for the last couples of years, I think. So, that's the good thing in trying new things. People wouldn't get to it instantly but once they get to it, it is worth the confusion at first. I also like those songs in the last albums such as I Hate That For You, January Bloom, Favourite Place, Pretty Venom and everything because they sound a bit different. But, honestly, and don't get me wrong, this single just sounds typical All Time Low, which is not bad but I guess you guys should try new things, new sound, new wave. I love you guys pls don't get me wrong.
Getting Cartel vibes from this one
AMAZING - ALL TIME LOW is my ALL TIME HIGH
I take my hat off!
Holy s*it, this its goood!! Goosebumps everywhere
Awesome !
это все без слов, потому что трек бомба, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/Q4i2shVKwAo

Ahh  Obsessing 😍
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
I love All Time Low
Lyrics are just way too perfect. Just hit me on one love story I had and...I can relate on this, try to forget you gotta pretend to. Thank you. Your songs gave me life.
sounds good!
I feel like they're so comfortable with their sound now, I absolutely love this, what an amazing song
This song just brightened up my day!

Is it just me or like are there a lot of freaking references????
It is 2021 guys, what an unrealistic Music Video! Where are the Masks?

Y’all- I think I found my new fav band 😌
I missed these kinds of musics. Remember the times when everyone was listening to this kinds of music. Just ✨taste✨
Больше лайков и просмотров! Российские фанаты поддержат! :)

Once in a lifetime, I found my favorite band of all time. I am serious, this is it! Thank you, keep it Low (up) All Time Low.
If you’re a fan of ATL, type in “ VIRTUAL REALITY by ALPHA MARTIN “ you will NOT regret it
Es Radio Doble Nueve 99.1FM Lima, Perú!
pretty boisss
My new favorite song this is the forst new favorite since therapy
LOVe it!!
I'm 31 and just discovered All Time Low. Listening to them makes me feel like I'm back in junior high, falling in love for the first time and thinking everything will always be all right. I don't know why that is. But I like this feeling.
Feels Good 🖤
This gave me memories I don't have and I love it haha
all time low is the king of references
Fucking love it omg it’s amazing lol
YESSS THIS IS A BANGER!!!! Chuuya approved
Hang on. This isn’t talking heads
THIS IS SO GOOD
You should do more songs that are like dear Maria count me in that's the best song I've heard after monsters
капец уже как раз слушал его и очень прикольный трек, просто послушайте https://youtu.be/Q4i2shVKwAo
So good
parece um comercial da C&A
ЭТОТ пацан начал недавно виложуваты свои треки, Очень не обычно, просто сами послушайте https://youtu.be/Q4i2shVKwAo
This man's vocal  Actually range really Impressive
Ya mone
I’m obsessed 🤩 😍 with this song. I never get tired of listening to it.
All time low, you got mind goin today with this song
Sings "All Time Low". Also says "just like that" like they didn't just rip that straight from sleeping in 😂
yes now this feels like the right all time low ❤️❤️
Is this the music vid that mikey way was seen at???
From Dear Maria, Count Me In to THIS🔥🔥
may bago na namang kanta All Time Low, 'di ko pa rin nahahanap si Matthew Summers. HAHAHAHA
Never disappointed with this band
They Getting Old. .but the Spirit of Great Music still there. .LoveYouGuys
Silly fan theory: The last few singles have been working through the Kubler-Ross stages of grief following a break up.  In the "Sleeping In" video, we see the boys getting dumped by their respective girlfriends (Shock) then singing a happy song about being in love (Denial).  "Monsters" is Anger and Bargaining.  "Once in a Lifetime" is working through the Depression and moving towards Acceptance.
MY BOYFRIEND IS SOOO INLOVE WITH YOU GUYS AND THAT'S OKAY WITH ME.
É foda
😢😢😢😢😢😭
Ma'am I've been here since I was 10 and I do not regret any single year. Love this guys.
Alex Gaskarth would look so much better if he thinned his eyebrows. Seriously go through google images, it looks like someone took a black chisel marker to all his photos. The guy is extremely good looking otherwise.
Yang dari Indonesia mana aja nih 😋
BETTTTTTTTT
omg all time low
THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE REAL
lisTEN HERE SONNY BOY THIS SONG YOTE ME STRAIGHT BACK INTO MY EMO PHASE
i’m losing my mind this is so good 😩❤️

Haha you said all time low
*the chorus*  everyone: *Pointing Leonardo DiCaprio*
Same as it ever was
I thought this was going to be a cover of the talking heads song. I’m still not disappointed.
I from Indonesia ❤️ love for All time Low ❤️
Thank you boys this is such a bop already <3
i am OVER THE MOON for this new vibrant style of all time low. they keep reinventing summer in their music and keep it fresh <3

Terrible.. sounds like they put a song out just to put something new out.
This is hitting just right during a depressive episode and break up recover stage.
All time low it is a great rock group!!!
All time low: “all time low” Everyone: wait that’s illegal
Absolutely amazing!! Perfect song to hear first thing in the morning
when the movie says the title of the movie
Hope there is new album. Really love this song.
The “I hit an all time low” gives the same vibe as when they say a movie title in the movie
Eto yung tagalog comment na hinahanap mo 👍
BAND NAME : ALL TIME LOW SONG NAME :ALL TIME LOW ALBUM NAME : (SELF TITLED) ALL TIME LOW This would be nice lol
HOW ARE ALL THESE SONGS SO GOOD 😫✋ this is gonna be stuck in my head all day 😍

All time low deserves more love
Sofie Rovenstine，beautiful girl ！
I've missed you guys.
Suka banget deh
Not talking heads
Zack showin off more hair than he has since he was a teen.
OH SH—
Couldn't resist making a tiktok to this banger! I hope I did you proud! @jus10law10
BOIIII GRABEEEEE SIGE
Excelente aquí siempre apoyándolos  saludos desde Colombia 🔥🇨🇴❤️
Thank you for coming back again 🥺🥺💖
OMG BABIESSSSSS 🥺
❤️🔥
i hope a heart only breaks this band
Please never stop making music! Gosh every song ATL’s puts out is absolutely amazing!! 🤘🏻 it’s my goal to see y’all live someday (when it’s safe and when I’m financially able to 😅😂🥺💜)
Man he still sounds the same just... Better. This is what happens when you take care of yourself, I still remember when Dear Maria first dropped and it's been uphill ever since. Love this!
That little synth line at 2:35 totally takes me back to the whole neon pop punk scene from the late 2000’s / early 2010’s, and I can’t get enough of it! This song is a banger!
any indonesian fans? yes I’am!!!
I think All time low gonna back the nostalgia music they made year's ago
ALL TIME LOW PULLIN THROUGH ONCE AGAIN OMFG IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE U ON TOUR IN THE FUTURE :,D
Totally want to see another concert for old time sake, aged like fine wine All Time Low. 😘❤️
They keep aging like fine wine that I'm willing to be drunk by it <3
Who the heck dislike this video
lods 👍
So meta...and I love it.
My boys are back 💙💙
Wondering where are all his band batchmates #longliveATL
That "ALL TIME LOW" line gives me chills
45 disliked, how could you.
Before I hit play I thought “are they going to cover the great Talking Heads song?” These guys have grown up and it’s great to see them make new music.
YESYESYESYESYES
OKAY WOW THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVES FROM YALL
Still amazing since 2008!
Kings are back !
You never disappoint
All Time Low 2021. Damn.
It makes you feel like you're the main character
I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOO MUCH
I feel sooo nostalgic thank you for this 🤍
🇵🇭 fan from the Philippines 🇵🇭
Suportang tunay sa inyo  mga lods
Y’all still amaze me every time 😭😭 I love you guys. So proud of you guys. 🥺🥺❤️❤️
Man, it's like I'm 14 again listening to them in middle school doing homework in the library and dancing in the halls at lunch. All those references, new or old, are such nostalgia reelers. It's amazing tjat they can still have that kind of impact on my teenage years.😊
WHAT A WAY TO HAVE A GOOD DAYYYYY NDIXKSKSK WOKE UP WITH THISSSSS
How do you still manage to make good music❤❤❤
ALEX GASKARTH IS LIKE FINE WINE 🍷
All Time Low never fails ♥️
Leaving a comment so that I can look back at this as I age ♥️✨
Had to throw an "all time low" in there. Love you guys 🖤
I can't get enough of this song.
Missed this vibe. Sooo High school lol
i missed the once in a lifetime premier of once in a lifetime dangit
Absolutely beautiful
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IT'S SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They could only add the lyric "all time low" Once in their band's Lifetime :^)
I love it
Okay this is epic!
Iike the song but why you had to say your band name in your own song?  Isn't  That  the  one thing band should not do ?
For fuck sakes.  These guys keep it  youthful, n0 matter how old we are getting.
Woah this is surprisingly really good!!!!
"I wanna drink Wanna think Write a song about it I wanna smoke Make a joke Try to hide the damage" ♪♫
Beautiful.
2021 might be crazy but at least we still have All Time Low making absolute bangers!
Try to forget you Gotta pretend to ‘Til I hit an all-time low 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song gave me so good vibes from the last album they dropped, which I enjoyed it so much and I keep listening :)
🔥🔥🔥
Whoaaaa on the beat! damn
I don't understand why they are underrated. I mean, they always releases 🔥 songs. And they are in the scene for almost 15 years (I guess?). Is it bad marketing, bad record label? Idk, I just hope that more people can appreciate their newer works, not just DMCMI
murdered repeat button.
Ughh. I swear there isn't a single All Time Low song that I don't like.
another awesome song to be played early in the morning!!!!! *PLAYS THE MUSIC LOUDER IN MY ROOM* ONCE IN A LIFETIMMMEE
AYE YO NEW ALL TIME LOW SONG JUST DROPPED
bop
First 10 seconds, and it's already my favorite song
so like... was it their house? because if the bling ring taught me anything it's don't take pictures or invite friends when you break and enter.
IM FUCKING CRYING THIS SIS DSO GOOD OIDJSLKIWHDFEKJIOKLJWM
I'm 23 years old now but everytime I listen to a All Time Low song my teenage angst is crumbling
All Time Low with an actual "All Time Low" in the lyrics. my life is completed. also Zack's hair is fabulous.
Need to hear this live 😭❤️
💖💖💖
♥️😍😘
I miss the old ATL but still love them ♥️
lezgooooooooooooooooooooo❤❤❤❤
Day 1st. Nice.
Lead single to an upcoming album? Hope hope?
honestly this is my situation right now. thanks for dropping this. fave band really always there to save their fans
If you stream this till you can't even stream it anymore I'll love you forever.
zach and jack backing vocals zach and jack backing vocals zach and jack backi
solid fans here in Philippines....support my.channel bro #MyGie Cinco
Think it's for a new album?
Why is no one talking about Zack’s hair????
This is such a nice song, But I want "Future Hearts" vibe. Except for "Monsters", almost all the songs at RAMEN aren't my cup of tea. I miss you guys in the past!
the e guitar on the last chorus feels nostalgic ugh this song is a banger
All time low is life ❤️ thank you guys for your music. Makes my days better everyday.
My soul is alive again
the 35 people that disliked this are pissed that they didn’t think of the all time low lyric
i will love you guys till i hit an all time low
YOUR MUSIC STAYS ALIVE! thank you so much <3
Brasileiros que curte o som foda deles! Curte ai. Qu VIBE esse som o clip então 👏🏻🇧🇷
[Intro] Once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime  [Verse 1] I wanna drink Wanna think Write a song about it I wanna smoke Make a joke Try to hide the damage I wanna drive this car Right over the edge Of every bad idea I didn't have yet  I look at you Look at me Feeling kinda tragic Dazed and confused Hard to see Where we lost the magic I never meant to be hypocritical This fucking crazy rides left me cynical  [Pre-Chorus] Just like that I know there's no turning back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it  [Chorus] Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast And kill me slow Try to forget you Gotta pretend to 'Til I hit an all-time low  Once in a lifetime Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you Gotta pretend to I hope a heart only breaks this bad Once in a lifetime  [Verse 2] I try to run Try to hide Just forget about it I tell myself Every night I could live without it I wanna say good-bye to the loneliness But every time I do, I make another mess  [Pre-Chorus] Just like that I know there's no looking back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it  [Chorus] Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast And kill me slow Try to forget you Gotta pretend to 'Til I hit an all-time low  Once in a lifetime Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you Gotta pretend to I hope a heart only breaks this bad Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime  [Pre-Chorus] Just like that I know there's no turning back We already made this bed And I can't even sleep in it  [Chorus] Once in a lifetime Never the right time Take it fast And kill me slow Try to forget you Gotta pretend to 'Til I hit an all-time low  Once in a lifetime Never the right time To throw out everything we had Try to forget you Gotta pretend to I hope a heart only breaks this bad  Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad) Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Once In a lifetime... there is a band like this that lifts you up no matter what your going through and ways seems to relate. Once in a lifetime
me watching this with a headache: *the pain was worth it*

They stole the freaking house, cant have shit in detroit
Cade o video ft com @ ddlovato?
Better than ADTR's new stuff.
I'm so happy seeing All Time Low in my feed again. I discovered ATL when I was in junior high and now that I'm in my 20s they're still my comfort band; even though my music and life have drastically changed💙
that GUITAR AT THE END???? HOLY HECK!!!
Lyrics: "till i hit an all-time-low"  Me: shocked pikachu face
BRUH
The song reminds me of so predictable by set it off
Guess I'll just fucking LOVE anything you guys put out at this point.
pog
“Til I hit an ‘all time low” he said it!
You guys lost me with FH/LYR, but I'm all on board with all this new shit. WUS is 100% bangers and this is another. Best music of your careers 👏
honestly im not ready for a new album. i feel like WUS didn't get proper treatment bc of covid. don't get me wrong, i adore this song though. i just hope they can do some touring soon for WUS
👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
fell in love with the song; fell in love with the music video. you guys never fail to amaze me! can't wait to see this live ❤
I Love it. It's new but still has that All Time Low feel!
YESSIR
One more amazing song. I love it!
AAAAHHHHHHH
when the author says the name of the book in the book :)
ATL saying the words All Time Low in their own song? *ICONIC* Also, what a bop...as if you guys could come out with anything else.
oh yeah im obsessed with this one
Im still waiting for a monster music video
nobody:    Me liking the video before even watching
ATL ARE BACK BBY! <3 BANGER!
Lyrics are deep 🌠
A BANGER! AHHH
🤘💖
Probably my favorite song of 2021 yet!!!
THIS.... this is a chart topper!
Nice
Has it really taken this many years for all time low to use all time low in their lyrics?
Love the drums in the song!
This went so hard, well done guys it’s amazing!👏🏻👏🏻
I love you guys
this is particularly spicy, wow look at the boys go
this song is (other than a banger) a game of “how many other atl refs can you spot?”
Bro what is this shit you guys are making now. What happened to y’all
monsters outsold
This music video is giving me intense scrapbooking vibes and im ALL for it
oh how I've missed you
Just imagine how fucking good this is going to be live!
Um okay, boys yall ain't had to go off this hard, damn 😐🤚🏻
Good one boys!
This is my jam, absolutely LOVE it!! Sending so much love from Norway!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really needed this. I only have work friends and my bf is my only bestfriend now because our partner, (my best friend for 10 years broke up with my bf and I and left. ) this song is exactly how I'm feeling. this band always put out music I need to hear at the perfect times! ❤
AHHH
To much auto tune on their songs lately
My new favourite All Time Low song!
Crazy good song! Love it
Thx for this bday gift <3
They FINALLY included “all time low” in their lyrics!! 2021 is hope! 😂
QHHH YEAHHH ITS QMAZINF
incredible bop like always 🥺 missing you guys ❤️
I love atl's genre they've created. like it's taking their old sound and more pop-ier sounds to mix together. It's neat!
This is already miles better than the entire Wake Up Sunshine album.  Hopefully our boys will finally be back!!   Also THEY SAID IT, THEY SAID THEIR NAME!!!
Watching this made me so happy, I couldn't stop smiling! So proud of you guys, you really hit it out of the park with this one ❤️🔥
WERE SO SPOILED THIS IS SO GOOOD AHHH
NOT THE NAME DROP !!!!!!!1 <3
This is a good song song you killed it!!!!!!
LOVE.
✨❤️❤️❤️🙌🏻❤️❤️❤️✨
Have you guys ever heard of talking heads?
Did you see all the fun they were having together as friends! Gosh that's all i want :0
Bro, I love ATL so much that I literally set up an alarm at 5AM to catch the premiere asfdjksss going back to sleep now. ANOTHER GOOD MUSIC THAT WILL SAVE ME!
I love how All Time Low's music, ironically, always has such an optimistic tone. Really makes ya feel good!
It's still not a phase, it's a lifetime style.
TO THE 13 DISLIKES... Excuse me, but why are you even here?
Ustedes no tienen canciones malas o que?
As always great music great lyrics great video
Feels good to see everyone without masks on their face for a change.
Pop Punk’s not dead!! Still Rocking!! 🤟🇧🇷
Very good boys 😁
*GASP* they said their name
Did you see how happy they looked to be taking photos of each other! That was so cute and wholesome :)
Woke up 5am here in the Philippines for this premier hahaha worth it!
I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVE
3:04 oh sh-
This song gets sleeping in stuck in my head
Outrageous.
Love it boys 💖
Yet another hit! How has all time low not done a song with dj Khaled cuz Another ONE! MOM IT WAS NEVER A PHASE
lmao, stayed till the very end with my 80 people in the rewatch gang  Honestly, this has been the highlight of my week. I'm trying hard to live life to the fullest, to be a good friend and family member, to be a good employee, and a successful undergrad but I'm drowning. I skipped work to rest and have spent the morning doing homework and being there for two people who are going through hard times while also trying to plan some time for myself with other friends. Being an adult is hard, but one thing at a time.   I'll take chances and take the good days with the bad and I'll smile through the tears because I know I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Thank you, ATL, for inspiring me with your lyrics. I've got the Guts to charge head-on into this messy world thanks to you.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
!!!!!!! YES YES YES to this video and to this song!! I honestly lost my marbles when I heard the song this morning but the video makes me love the song even more!! I love the aesthetic of the video so so much omg thank you always ATL for always working so hard and putting out such amazing music!!
Oh my god!!! I love you guys so much You're all so talented 😭😭❤️
You are telling me that others have seen/heard this like yesterday... And for me it says posted 17 min ago 👀👀
LOVE IT, you guys are amazing ❤❤❤
i already love this so much
I feel like the group of friends in the video were listening to All Time Low while partying, and so the band playing in the same house can be viewed symbolically. Or maybe not but it's a fun theory
Ugh, the boys are back! I swear no song is ever a let down. Thank you for being such a genuine and pure band and individuals. I hope one day say this all to you guys in person when it's safe to do so. Much love guys! 🧡
SOOOO GOOOOOOD OMGGGGG
all time low finally putting the words all time low into a song=instant love of song
I love this so much. THEYRE SO GOOD. Always giving us bops
amazing as always!!! thank u guys 🖤🖤
again, a smashing bridge.. damn
Neat
THIS GOES ACTUALLY SO HARD
Absolutely love it 🤘🤘🤘This has made my week 🙌
I have the same feeling for 12 years when I listen to your music. Thank you! ~
My favorite part is when he said “once in a lifetime”
This is so fucking good!! I’m so fucking proud of you guys 🤘🏻🔥
idk but for some reason Alex singing "All Time Low" feels illegal lol
It's a damn banger and I love it so much
The girl in this video reminds me SO much of Micarah Tewers and now I need her to make a video wearing only these outfits for a week
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY SUNG ALL TIME LOW
Considering that Jack half-wrote this one I am surprised the title isn't a Home Alone reference
Pop punk is coming back baby!
THEY SAID IT, THEY SAID THE THING. ROLL CREDITS
Yooiiw
Я посмотрела это второй раз внимательнее и это реально восхитительно!
Br🇧🇷 ?
I love it. Good Job Job ❤
why are you guys so talented omg
I haven't listened to atl in a really long time, but their songs are still soooo good, and this one isn't an exception
All Time Low has done it again 🥺💗
Brb while I cry over this 🥺🥺🥺🧡🧡🧡😭😭😭

All time low never disappoints 🤙👍

That was awesome! Such a different vibe than the “normal” All Time Low stuff, but still perfectly them. I’m convinced at this point they can’t make a bad song!
when a band says their own name in a song & your head implodes. thanks for the banger, boys!
Perfect
Released on the same day myself and my partner exchanged on our 'family home' 😍 needed this happy stroke of fate after undoubtedly the hardest year of our lives - thank you boys 💕
I'M EXCITED TO HEAR THIS LIVE!! SUCH A BANGER!!   pretty sure everyone will go wild at the "all-time low" part and I'm looking forward to it!!!!!!!!!

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test:  1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)  2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)  3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)  4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.  5.Honor your father and mother.  6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).  7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).  8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).  9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).  10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)  James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.  If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  Pray something like this:  "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."
