Awsome ❤❤❤
Lots of Jews near the Palm Tree House
Just seeing this, sorry! I never got a notification. This is so cute though and I love the creativity!
guys, this is incredible!!
brilliant
wow
I really hope the energy psychic was a character, but I have do little faith.
All my relatives who were well loved have died inside their home (or their child's home). It's the most peaceful way to go.
Ngl “Damn, Jane ghosted us.” Got me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love that office wallpaper where theyre going over which house to go to though
I dont wanna know about my house lol
Was Jane scripted to sound like a lunatic or was she being serious?😂😂😂😂
no! wait! Rhett! Link! I smell something fishy! THAT HOUSE IS HAUNTED BY THE DOBRE BROTHERS
A sam and colby collab would be off the chain!!🥳
I love that they curse a little now. 😂
the scariest part of this video is the thermostat set at 77 degrees
link that low end theory hoodie is awesome
I want to believe the psychic lady was not an actor and is in fact real….. please let me believe someone lives with kind of confidence in their delusions 😂
27:13 can we talk about Link’s acting here????
That voicemail 😂
Omg I love this so much! ❤
"You killed it..." Is this going where I think it's going?
Psychics are psycho and useless and just…
They paid a grand for some women to point her finger at nothing and make noises with her mouth 😂 it’s actually crazy cause she’s legit a scam artist. Ghosts aren’t real and even if they were, that wouldn’t do anything.
Oh boy this lady is a fraud!
How  is 61 sparce?????
THEY MENTIONED “NATUFORDE” I REMEMBER THAT!!
After watching the D&D episode I feel like the theme here is “clinically insane people who own businesses in LA”
It's interesting he said spirits like cold places cause about half the time I've felt bad spirits was when I was hot. Looking back I say it actually felt like hell.. hot, no energy, mentally drained but can't rest. Literally felt like hell.
I think it's time to send her back to her padded cell.
By far the funniest voice mail ever.
10:28 😂
Schizophrenia in a nut shell
That womans reaction to "Dis-carne taco" made me love her immediately
now they will be doing those exact tasks for the rest of their time in that home lol
props to the writers who came up with that 'sheets and dishwasher' plant and payofff, so clever!
I need that wallpaper….
loved this fanfiction
links tribe called quest long sleeve is so fire
From a person who watched a lot of horror movies, but is now actively avoiding them I love how this scratched a certain itch, without all the drawbacks of a full-blown horror movie experience  😁
I know I’m super late but this is the best horror short film I ever seen!
liiiiink i want to see your houssssseeee
I might be in the wrong career after hearing wat Jane gets for scamming the heck outta these guys.
Do you ever get flack for any of your designs at pop-ups or otherwise? I'm specifically thinking of your Pride designs since you're in Iowa. As someone who also lives in the Midwest, I love seeing the designs from you!
Don’t let these guys near witches on etsy
It wouldve been cool if they went to two houses one hanuted one unhaunted and be able to see if they could guess which is which 😂
I'm always surprised when they support a con artist.
16:00 love the shout out to the 805. 🤣🤣🤙🏽
PLEASE make a full length horror movie!!! you guys absolutely have the acting down, the camera crew with an incredible set of skills, budget for editing, costuming, etc....cmon, give the people what they want!! :D
Link's Low End Theory sweater is so unbelievably cool. Haven't watched you guys at all in almost 8 years but just graduated uni and I'm so happy to see you guys again 💚
oh my goodness this was peak cinema, im actually blown away. the color grading, the script WOW
Actually Rhett and Link would make an unreal paranormal pair doing investigations! Please consider this.  These guys are amazingly entertaining 😂
i like to believe it was jane
Ok Link in the extermeownator costume is sending me 😂
This was incredible, should we be expecting a rhett and link movie one day??
we neeeeeed more of these!
I fell asleep and woke up right before they got in the hot tub. I was legitimately creeped out at the horror part. Im rewatching the whole thing because i dont scare easily. Most horror movies are cheesey. This, weirdly enough, didnt feel cheesey until they went back in to clean 😂😂😂
I thought "oh that's cool the watch is waterproof"..... nevermind 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where can I apply for a job like Jane's. I'm apparently in the wrong field! I love this video BTW. You guys are top notch.
I miss Nartu Fouty
Their willing to risk their lives to strip the sheets and load the dishwasher over $250! Hilarious!
The way link stepped in to save Rhett that is a true friend
With the who died in my house thing I wanna know but I also don’t wanna know
I’m sitting here laughing at how ridiculous this “psychic” or whatever is, then I realize she’s the one who made a quick $1000 and got to meet and work with Rhett and Link.
Rhett and Link should check out a haunted house with an exorcist!  I’d love to see what the spirits think 😂.
The scariest part of this video is that the thermostat was set to 77
Rhett was right this does make a terrible show
MY DREAMS CAME TRUE!!!!!! Posting on the main channel just like how I originally found them!! I know I'm so late but it's nice to see.
The old lady is bs 😂
i went to sleep with this playing, and woke up at 23:32 and i’m so confused as to why rhett is laying under a bench while link counts down ominously 😭?  edit: holy moly i just watched from the timestamp onwards and that was amazing
better than netflix..Hxx
Loved this!
Rhett and Link Play Hide And Seek in an AirBnB: THE MOVIE
this feels like an actual nightmare, love it
Noooooo😂
I'm watching this in 2025, and it's still gold. Still can't believe they made this masterpiece of a short film.
I really wanna believe that creepy ass cat and mouse game really was just what there was in an Airbnb
Got scammed out of $1000 😂😂
links shirt🙌🏼 we love the tribe
16:00 805!
Wouldn’t a church def be haunted by definition? Hmm kinda makes you think… take an e meter or whatever bet there’s just stinky farty seats
actually one of my favorite videos on the internet
that's a lot of steps to write off a mini vacation lmao
Everything about this video is amazing
3:44 I HAVE THE UPMOST RESPECT FOR THEM HAVING A UNCLE IROH FUNKO POP
Link wearing a tribe called quest shirt,,, always knew he was chill like that
The voicemail killed me 😂
can we PLEASE make ghost hunting a thing.
my house was built in 1911 imagine a few people died in my house
26:35 Rhett's hair is a paid actor
This give unus annus vibes
please go real ghost hunting with Sam and Colby
14:58 and that's just a WHAT
That voicemail lmaooooo
Rhett and Link consistently find people that I am unsure if they are acting or a real person.
I was really hoping the killer was the ghost lady
I loved the acting in this. So great! I am glad I discovered wonderland!!
Wait im so curious, are these fully scripted? I can never tell with these guys 😭
This is incredible! This channel leaves me speechless, just incredible❤
That's not a cape cod style house...  That's super contemporary compared to the houses around me
That lady if so full of crap 😂😂😂
RHETT AND LINK EXPLORE UNHAUNTED HOUSE AT 3 PM! *GONE RIGHT??* :O
Ha ha it was probably the ghost removal lady, that’s why she didn’t answer the phone!😂😂🤫😉
Rhett and link after they realized they paid 1k for a fingergun fireball is hilarious.😂😂 pew pew💀
THE BEST VIDEO YET!!!! This was incredible 100000 out of 10!! Loved it thanks Rhett and Link👏👏👏
10:12 awesome line
The thermostat being set to 77 is the true crime here
Bravo
She is the irl Reigen Arataka
The absurdity of the fact that I’ve never questioned why there would be multiple portals in one place 😂😂 what they using the extra ones for!? 😭😭😭
This episode has many genre of tv and straight up Halloween, serial cat-mask crimes
Wow this lady is nuts
You can’t convince me that psychics are real. Especially if they’re claiming to be able to “remotely” know.
you guys need to do an EP on you guy secretly getting jacked then do a 1v1 body builder contest
Scammed hard
Link was a savage to that psychic. "you don't look too exhausted, not sure how much work you did" 😂😂
I’ll clear you’re house for 800
not me watching this in October the day the Menedez brothers documentary came out.. 😳
Did Link just go on Zollow and look up houses with spa's?
27:12 can't believe we got rhett and link hurt/comfort before gta6 /j
the Menendez thing aged kind of poorly lol
I have an unclandestine meth lab
Rett gave it his all when he yelled for Link. shivering
This video should be called “Watch Rhett and Link get scammed”
What’s brilliant about this new style is you can’t quite tell when it’s banter and when it becomes scripted
the scariest thing about this is the thermostat being set to 77. Enjoy your terrarium lizards
why they die tho
now i need a full length rhett & link horror movie
11:07 aint no way they got scammed by a random grandma😭
I love how this video boiled down to hey we took a short vacation in a nice normal Airbnb 🤣
I feel like they could have gotten the same result with have a pastor or priest blessing the house and doing a cleanse for free😂
newer viewer here why has link died in two of the cinematic videos that ive watched so far
1k on an Un-Haunter, probably several hundred on ghost hunting equipment  Gotta make sure they don't get that 250 service charge though
Link's face at 10:27 LOL🤣
The real jumpscare was the fact that the thermostat was set to 77 😂
the start if the video feels like they are secretly tnarrowing down which house to buy
my favorite one so far , i love seeing them act in horror skits
This is what YouTube was created for…clever entertainment and not about making a buck. Something Rhett and link have stuck to since day one, minus their own merch announcements.
I genuinely dont know if these ghost people are frauds and are stealing money, or if theyre true and the untrained human eye can't comprehend these things.
Rhett's face when she said she have to Fireball the ghosts got me rolling! 🤣
I am struggling to figure out how many people actually die OUTSIDE of a house. A house is protective?
I'm not fully convinced the ghost expert lady isn’t schizophrenic
I love how Rhett’s laugh is so instant.
You heard it here, folks. Link says it's officially certified as unhaunted.
Please make a full-length horror movie at some point! I love the way that you mixed horror and comedy. Not completely to the level of spoofiness that most horror comedies do. It was so cool!
I'll bring this to my film professor so that the film students now and for future generations can study this cinematic masterpiece
I wanna see her reaction to the voicemail that was hilarious
Definitely Jane under that mask
the fact that they make better shorts than most people make movies makes me kind of sad
I thought there was a new episode of Wonderhole in the middle of the week lol
4:56 That would honestly be interesting
why do all these videos seem like skits but real vlogs at the same time
15:04 the homie NarToFodie
So we'll done on the horror department, keeping the comedy in tact as well.
Can't believe I never saw this, what a picture!
23:49 .... who... who made that?
that lady is a scam lol 997
$997 for the equivalent of Miss Cleo is nasty work.
Jane is insane.
Lololol ❤ stop firing radio at the plant it's going to kill it
you guys continue to be some of the best dudes on here. Been around my whole life, and ill continue to watch!
Sam and Colby + Rhett and Link? Maybe? 😳
This is such a great vid idk how it doesn’t have more views
RF = radio frequency
I think the most haunting thing in this whole video is that you left the house at 77 degrees
Rhett & I were born on the exact same day & year. So my one question:  why doesn’t he have any grey in his hair or beard??  lol
i dont usually comment but trying to help to algorithm! i really liked this episode and i see where wonderhole got its inspo! keep going at it boys!
I would 100% watch UnHaunted. 😂
This video is hilarious
the scariest part is that the thermostat was set to 77
scariest part of the video was finding out they keep the house at 77°
LOLLLLLLLLLLL😂
Wow! Love the surprise at the end ❤😂
lol dude that lady robbed ya
Nartu Fody mentioned
@20:25 I saw someone. Its a ghost that the camera caught!!
We totally need a full length Rhett and Link horror movie
I’m so not used to hearing Rhett and link drop the f bomb lol.
“An Oxnard!”
Link with the low end theory shirt okay I see you
More of this style content pleassee❤
Please do more of these. This was hilarious
Amazing video but wth kind of game was that😂
Ghosts are actually distorted radio signals xD
5:50 He's a thoughtful guy
That was hilarious, but also really cinematic 😂
They should have kept this until they were retiring from YouTube
“love you!” ….. “love … you?” “I don’t know man I got nervous!!!!”
I was not expecting to have such an amazing cinematic experience
I ABSOLUTELY love the voice mail you left her!🤣🤣 You guys are one of a kind.
They definitely just paid a lady $997 to play finger guns in a house
Wish they would have tried Ouija board.  I would never play this game in a house I haven’t been to😂.  Hiding in rooms I don’t know.
we got a free horror movie at the end 😭
This was fun!
they just got an air bnb
This is the best thing ever- Ives watched it 3x already. Not only is it hilarious but I genuinely got a little spooked at the end. I need more of this ASAP
Collab with Sam and Colby on a REAL haunted place... like an old abandoned asylum, hospital, or school.
:O I just realized Stuart is the killer ?! I enjoyed this style of content a lot; awesome how it changes style for the ending; great job! :D
I was so ready for the murderer to be the ghost psychic lady whatever she is
I enjoyed this so much <3
Wow! Well done!
bro the cinematic value in this is insane. I love it !
That was a masterpiece.
The fact that "mouse in the house" found a way to make people pay to play hide and seek is the epitomy of capitalism.🤭
jane is KILLING me. "i fireball it." "there were four portals to the underworld in that house." girl WHAT
Loved this video guys absolutely amazing
I’m late to the game finding these videos, but have been watching GMM for awhile…these videos were such a neat surprise to me, I love them. I hope you guys keep working on stuff like this.
This is my favorite Rhett and Link video ever.
Jane from geyser energy clearing services has her business model figured out. doesn't even need to leave her house to do readings
I thought an un-haunted house would be a house that was haunted but then an exorcism was performed and now its "fixed"
Lol y'all got bamboozled... Y'all spent $1000 on con-artists. 😂😂😂
😂!
What an amazing twist at the end lol
The hot tub bit was 1000
I love it thanx 😍
I NEED to know where that green foresty wallpaper comes from. Sleuths, any leads?
A SEQUEL BETTER COME SOON PLS!!
They need to make a sequel!
Man! Please do an unhaunted house series! The whole video was great. The ending was really something else, it’s really cool to see you guys go all out in a way you don’t tend to like that, but I would adore a series of videos in houses just like the majority of the video was. What a great premise.
What a minute that was AWESOMEA
Close enough, welcome sam and colby.
i'm obsessed with the green mushroom wallpaper at the beginning
That voicemail was almost worth the thousand dollars LMAO
Hey I can do this ghost google maps thing too but I only charge $447 so just saying if yall ever do a part 2
This was amazing!!
Great video, I love the vlog, documentary, cinema thriller thing going on but what I love the most is that dang wallpaper in the room they are planning where to stay. I have been searching for 3 hours on and off trying to find it. Can someone please please pretty please someone help me find this wallpaper ❤
I was like 'why is this video so annoyingly dim??' then I realized it's 4am and my phone's brightness is at 3% 🫠🫥
That was crazy
This is too underrated ❤perfect dinner time video 😂❤
11:03 Rhett’s face when he hears she has to fireball them lolol
I LOVED the horror movie part! And the hilarious comedic ending of going back in to avoid the extra cost😂
Until I feel drunk maybe 40percent
Hot damn, I need to get into the psychic business
STAY home,Dont go!    I was afraid! Yes I am old but it scared me!
So yall gonna be on sam and colby or .....
Greatest part of this video after rewatching , “nartu fordy” links everlasting memory 😂😂😂😭
This is an absolute cinematic masterpiece 😭
Attorneys must be a lot cheaper in LA then in Western Canada 😮
That ghostbuster sounds like she's desperately trying to save her laughter for her trip to the bank.
The scariest thing about the whole  house was the thermostat set to 77 degrees
Love the movie in the end! That was super creative <3 the end in Everything xD
Why was this so damn hilarious!!! I’m mad I’m just now seeing this. I could have needed this laugh 6 months ago!
Does this lady really believe her own thoughts?
The audacity to charge people if they don't do your work to clean the house they're PAYING to stay in. I'd do everything it said to do take pictures for proof then undue it all and dispute the charge with the photos.
18:28 damn. Jane ghosted us.
I loved the cinematic! You guys should do more horror stuff! ❤❤❤
😾🙀😸
we need an unhorror movie
They are being so respectful to the ghost lady 😭
the best voicemail of all time
228?!
What I have the feeling that she is bluffing 😬
Arch angel micheal himself is stronggggg
I need another episode of this!!
Actual nightmare scenario. Made me shiver. Well done boys!! 26:32
This is gold. Even though it’s great content it’s physically painful to listen to the psychic lady talk.
they really got scammed
That voicemail was the funniest thing I’ve ever witnessed lmfao
What even is this guy’s 😂😂😂😂love yall
Tom Selleck magazine 😂😂
Link "If you get this come on over" Rhett "No! you don't have to come; no, but if yo want to call us".
so essentially jane is a shinigami 😭
I like the video but I'm not big on platforming scam artists like that psychic lady.
That phone conversation had me rolling😂😂
Ya'll got scammed hard by that lady.
I love this video
Can we get a Rhett and Link/ Shane and Ryan ghost hunt?
I thought I had bad social skills
Okay this took me wayyyy back to the start of the channel
What?! Was waiting for Jane to take the cat mask off at the end.
Can you guys actually go to an actually haunted house
I thought that Jane cost 9.97 and I said to myself thats not a bad deal until I realized 997. Omg hahaha
I don’t know how to say this correctly but sometimes I don’t watch a video because the title sounds ehhh and this was one of them. I watched it because of the lack of GMM rn and it was incredible the title does not sue it justice although I think that was the point lol
This was a GREAT horror short but I kept laughing because all I could imagine was cotton candy randy being under the mask the entire time
Idk why but i like how Rhett and link can cuss on this channel 😂
LOVE
Now team up with Shane and Ryan
I love how all of Links dinky little blank and white photos make each and every one of his choice houses look TOTALLY HAUNTED! lol! 👻👻 I would love to see these guys spend a few nights in an actual haunted house though. I feel like that would be a laugh a minute!🤣🤣
This is so well done, I am so impressed yall. I was also like, I love how this was suppose to be about an unhaunted house and they made a short horror film that ends up making the house haunted lol
Can’t believe the thermostat was set to 77… that’s way too high
Lmao I lost it when the lady said she Fireballed the hell portals
Somebody please tell me where to buy that burnt orange shirt with the pocket that Link is wearing in the interviews.
I didn’t know I was getting a cinematic masterpiece
Play D&D
I would have shat myself then jumped for joy if the camera slowly steady-cam'd behind the cat at the top of the stairs, becoming a harrowingly suspenseful one-shot.
The geyser woman had a lot of either unsure/dishonest tells that were present when talking about how many of whatever she found. These tells weren't present when she was showcasing her knowledge of ghosts or expounding on her process.
This is cool! unpredicted ending 💯
The fact that I felt my heart racing before I knew what was going on is insane. It's like my body knew something was going to happen but I didn't
alternative title: two bros in an air bnb hot tub
Link do you have an uncle iroh funko pop on your desk?
This is movie worthy! Lol 😆
the font they used for the scary intro is better than most horror movies i’ve seen
Honestly, The ending of this video of them playing that game was so freaking great!! 😂 Honestly better than almost every short horror film I’ve seen on here.  My husband never understood what I’m ALWAYS laughing at so I showed him a few videos and he was like ‘ehhh.’ Then watching this today he said ‘omg, they really are so great!!’ Had no idea he was watching next to me. Lmao. Please, make more short films. 😂❤
5:44 my name is also Kitty
997$ that is INSANE
Board james anyone?
She just wanted to see them dilf daddys in their tight trunks in the hot tub and i don't blame her lmao
That woman is a genius.
I genuinely felt like I just watched a high quality written horror movie. This short looks better than most Blumhouse horror movies 😭😂
Sam and colby should have them on !!! 😂❤
"...I had to fireball them..."
Is this real
they should’ve done before and after her exorcising it
I am a medium as well so, I can also do what she does lol. It is pretty cool to be able to do this for sure. 😊
that genre shift tho
I don't know why but "Fire here, idiots" had me in tears.
that game was the real haunt
No way they paid some random woman $1000 to tell them that every house had “ghosts” in it and she had to “clear the energies” PLEASE🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jane is an idiot 😂
I was skeptical when you announced this sort of content but I'm in love keep it up guys
Question, is the ghost psychic real? I don't know what is the skit and what isnt LMAO
Link is responsible with his toner and I can appreciate that 😆
" I Fireball it, these energies Push!"
Ive been wondering, I know you both have your own lives outside of the youtube content, and if I may ask; how often do you guys hang out off camera just as friends instead of co-hosts?
THE PRODUCTION VALUE. THIS IS SO COOL.
Idk if you guys were going for Sam and Colby vibes but you perfectly nailed how bs that is.😂
the thermostat being set at 77 was the scariest thing about this
I cant believe you guys are real this is so IMPRESSIVE AND FUNNY
work of art!!!!
How did you not test it before AND after? Next time fly her in. i want to see the whole stinking process my dudes. scientific method. I want to see you freaking out hearing some crazy stuff.
You can get in the hot tub and I can check in. 😂
Oh, I like this >:3
I know this is all a bit of fun, but it should be criminal that person is taken a grand from people for a complete scam. Some people are so desperate to speak with their loved ones and she is just robbing them of their money.
get these guys an acting role
the short movie with the exterminator game reminded me of the winnie the pooh horror movie 😂
This is a completely insane thing that you did. Great job y'all
The voicemail was the best😂
What a great anti-parody!! You guys are awesome
I want to see them visit all those other houses
Can’t believe they died rip Rhett and link you’ll always be in our hearts
Just came here after watching your latest video. This is great!
This kind of makes those of us that have dedicated our lives to the paranormal look like a joke
I'm so happy that Rhett and Link, and their crew are having fun doing what they love to do. It's what matters most in life and they are doing it. The production was great and fun to watch. I'm glad I get to see content like this on youtube. They are an inspiration that doing what you love is the best approach to life.
I used to watch a series on YT called dirty rooms and this show gives so much of that homely backroom explorer energy that I’ve been missing ❤😂
Link using a Tribe called quest sweatshirt ❤
$997? and later online service? she is the biggest troll ever
I wasn’t expecting that twist since it was so funny at the beginning- which was epic!! The lighting and the shots were incredibly well done as well!!!!!   It made for such an amazing and spooky experience!
I don't know if it was the webcam that she was using, but the cleanser had a black orb show up on the right side of her head twice during their conversation.
Genuinely never heard some call a hot tub a spa... for a bit I thought Link meant there was a spa near by haha because there is no way a house has a full spa - unless it is frickin Saltburn or something.
But they didn't check diedinhouse for Walter White's house
I am a big fan but lost interest when you hired the ghost lady. Even for a bit, that's still giving money and exposure to a charlatan.
I’m so glad I stuck around to the end.
the cat and mouse horror movie needs to happen
A priest would’ve done a house blessing for free. The only charge would be a donation to their church.
The transition from doing stuff in an unhaunted house to a horror movie was unexpected, but funny
That was definitely not a train wreck of a voicemail. Totally not a train wreck at all. 😂
10/10
I love these documentary style videos so much! The comedy, cinematography, and production is just *chef's kiss*
my great grandpa died in the main bedroom in bed in my old house and I do believe it was haunted. we also make a joke that I have a ghost following me, haha
I like the look of this, idk if thays the camera or editing but i dig it
This is a great parody of those ghost hunter channels. Nothing really happens but the creepy sound effects punch it up to make it seem like something paranormal is happening. And when something “paranormal” does happen, it’s clearly just something staged for entertainment value.
This is art 🙌
Bro I would pay $50 a month for the Mythical Society to have a vlog series where Rhett and Link go to different haunted houses. They would never lie to us for views, or if they did it would be so blatant that its obviously comical like the end of this video. Please guys we need this!!
"We could watch some thing" "Yeah that would be great content 🙄"  10 minutes later 😸🐀😨
why is link just looking for a spa🤣🤣🤣
Looks like grandma ate a Fire Flower and shot some fire balls at some rugs
Is the goal to find an unknown haunted house
Finger shot fireballs "Whosh!" I can't even...
"Yeah, im talkin bout SsSstainssss" 🤣🤣🤣 link so funny
Why does Jane look like Anne Rice 😭
When she said she fireballed them I assumed she meant gave them a shot of fireball, that is how we appease the spooky murder doll that has been in our house for 100 years. He’s the only one in our house that drinks spirits.  Oh I get it now.
that ending was insane😭😭 the lighting was crazy
Eric Vanlier the goat 🔥
I love how Link's blood was so obviously ketchup even though everything else was the perfect touch of realism. The lighting, music, story flow, etc was on point. ❤
It's always a treat to watch the work of true creatives like Rhett and Link. Loved the video!
Are u joking…this is so amazing, suddenly I have no words. You’re my favorite youtubers and creators of all time❤️
no because why would you scare me like that. UNPROVOKED!
Weight the house that had three dead people in white, and they just do a real ghost hunt
They are incredible actors I wish they would make a horror movie they would slay
I would like to see more ghost hunting from them. Rhetts reactions are always so fun. And I would like to see Link gets scared.
Lmao this is funny af
Toner is expensive
the hide and seek bit felt like an actual movie 😭 i loved it
That lady is a quack
Love it!
I like that it went from a normal video to an epic short film. Amazing work!!! I need more! 👏👏🎬
Omg the ending so was unexpected 😂 I loved it
It would be nice if rhett and link explore haunted places with Ryan and Shane .
Can someone plz tell me where they got that wallpaper in their "office"??? Its beautiful!
Rhett and Link should make a full length ‘Scary Movie’ type horror comedy movie. I would PAY to watch that 👏🏻
Link looked like Patrick Bateman with that blue zip up on😂
The last few horror things you guys have done on this channel have been amazing! I want more, absolutely killing it
There IS a board game called Mouse in the House but it’s not nearly as cool as the box the mythical crew created
I thought these guys don’t curse, but there were a few times near the end of that movie
If Rhett and Link drop a horror movie someday, I'd pay a $1000 to watch it!
How do ghosts feel about meth? killed me
This special is Nartu Fody approved.
Wow this is probably the best thing y'all have ever made
i fireball them omg im dying right now
Bro that ending
Great
The game cabinet is just a weird cosplay hide-and-seek?
I too would risk my life over a $250 fee for not putting my sheets and dishes in the washer & dishwasher. Heck it was already $997 before hand. At least there was a hot tub.
pew pew lol
I dont really believe in that stuff, but if those things were real, it makes sense there could be 'ghost type energies' around a house no one has died in because they could be spirits from a thousand years ago before there ever even was a Los Angeles.
I like to think Jane was behind the murder
I think I found a new profession. $1000 to BS people????
The video is great! But that woman...OMG I've never heard such utter BS about this stuff. I firmly believe in ghosts and the like but that was just horrible. She is a scam artist.
Do "Will it Chapstick?"!
21:21 is the Mouse In The House part. 23:45 is when the game starts.
that voicemail had me cackling. thanks for that
omg rhett and link videos are always so unhinged. i love it
So as someone who has studied the paranormal for the past 14 years, and grew up in a house with a demon, I’d have to say this psychic doesn’t know what she’s talking about lol. Ghosts are attracted to water because it’s an energy source. And I’ve never heard of whatever meat sack she’s talking about 😂 I’ve read books from Ed and Lorran Warren and everything she said makes no sense
I love how they just went along with whatever the ghost woman said and then their belief made her spiral out of control. Like she started with “this house has the best energy” and then when they believed all that was like “so there were four portals but I fireballed them by going “pew” with the help of my angels Gabriel and John or whatever”
This is beautifully shot
Can they do a not unhaunted house too aka..haunted. Gotta put those Internet toys through their paces.
Forward to voicemail…she ghosted us. 😵
I actually know that the previous owner of my house died in the house and I’m curious if it would actually come up on that website.
20:01 LMAOOO _love you?_ ITS FRYING!
Love Links jumper (sweater) - A Tribe Called Quest - The Low End Theory. One of the greatest hip hop albums of all-time!
Pure GOLD.
incredible
Can someone please help us locate that wallpaper in the beginning? My wife is obsessed.
Yoooo that horror bit at the end was so well-done. Link’s pained groans went straight to my heart and the end joke made me burst out laughing. Thanks guys. ❤️
It's fitting how the view was 666k when it was recommended to me.
rhett and link full length horror when??
“They want them for like a self checkout” lmao, I love Link
The “cleansing” lady is either crazy or a con artist, and R&L clearly know that. If people would pay me $1000 to look at houses on google and allegedly shoot finger guns at dark blobs, I’d be set for life.
THIS VIDEO WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE
That twist was EVERYTHING! I did NOT see that coming. Bravo!
I hope they’re a remastered version of me listening to RRRrHgh YES I AM A NERD
Anyone else get really caught off guard when they curse?
This is genius.
How do I get Jane’s job!?!
THE VOICEMAIL HAHAHA IM CACKLING
AHAHA GOTEEM
Guys full movie now 😡
Even if that woman wasn't an actress, the $1000 was still worth it just for the laugh 😂
They also paid for diedinhouse
Hey I've got that same Uncle Iroh Funko Pop from the Diedinhouse portion of the video, So whosoever's desk that is we share a kinship
Wait a sec did i find a hidden ironic joke? Rhett was scared of the killer and link charged a dude with a knife?
Please I can’t imagine the lady’s face when she listened to the voice message they left for her 🤣🤣🤣
I was late to this one, but man every time they get me. These new videos are such amazing pieces of Rhett and Link's true creativity!
I actually got chills …. great job guys!!!
Oooooh No 😮😮Rhett and Link died 🐧🐧🐧🐧 absolutely awesome short horror story , Rhett and Links videos our , absolutely knocking it out of the park 👍👍👍👍👍
This was pure genius. Peak entertainment. This channel is the best thing that has ever happened to YouTube.
I was waiting on today's video so I watched this again. Love it, love it, love it! The whole Mythical team has such talent!
nice
dude these videos are so underrated, you guys are THE best to ever do it. Perfect combination of humor, friendship, silly jokes and comedy, film making skills, editing and intensity. This is perfection
bro the QUALITY is insaneeeee
grrr YES I AM A NERD
Just a couple guys staying in an air bnb and I watched it all 😂😂
is the vlog all scripted or is thatimprov
Cannot believe that they spent 1000 bucks for some crazy lady to tell Rhett and link that they casually sealed a literal portal to hell and waving her finger in the air to get rid of a bunch of ghosts at someone’s house.
you can tell they are like.. not believing much about it XD loved it!
we spent the night in an haunted house
Love this cause youtubers normaly do the opposite
The transition to horror movie was so well done, and then worrying about the $250. 😆  It was awesome.
I love watching GMM then this video comes out and cussing just doesn't sound right
Only way this would of been better if at the end they are haunting the house bitching about how they cant get near the hot tub 😂
I absolutely loved this and the evolution of comedy to horror....and then back to a little comedy. Rhett and Link (and their crew of course) are friggin' creative geniuses and I can't wait for more.
It's hilarious and also infuriating that they paid this lady that can 'sense ghosts' $997
Loved this episode - laughed a lot 😂
I would love to watch yall actually go ghost hunting with full transparency. Like trying to actually find out if ghosts are real and there. And if theres no ghodts then great. Itd still be entertaining and real
Pure gold :D
I love how they somehow made that mouse in the house game look like a real movie. Very impressed ❤
Next time: "We spend a night at Link's grandma's house, and she bakes us chocolate chip cookies while telling stories about Link as a kid."
The most perfect unhaunted house makes for the most perfect murder house scene. It’s like the Jordan Peele effect.
5:15 im just interested in uncle iroh 😭😭😭🫡🫡🫡
How is it that some of the best suspense and genuine spookiness I've seen from a YouTube video this year came from Rhett and Link? Well done.
Yall seen the Psychic episode of Southpark? *pew pew, nananananananana, wah-wah-wah* 😅😅😅😅
Love it
That 6 bed, 3 car Rhett pulled up is on South Padre Island in Texas I believe
That woman came and went after $997 she got you blocked most likely 😂😂😂
As I put off watching this because I’m not huge on ghost hunter stuff, but saw it today since my kids wanted to watch. I absolutely LOVED the show at the end 😂😂😂 The $250! THE $250!😂😂😂
It’s time to collab with Sam and Colby since you’re pros now🤣🤣💗
I cant belive nerd and geek became friends after these years
I would love to play mouse in the house
OMG! It took me a while to realize that this is Rhett and Link NOT Shane and Ryan. 😅😅😅 I really thought I am watching Watcher Ghost Files. 😂
this is perfect. These short films are the best things they have ever done
The punchline really got me laughing out loud. Thank you for posting videos to this channel, feels like the authentic Rhett n Link art!
THIS IS BY FAR MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL it reminds me of the old rhett and link content!
this video was incredible
Cant believe they paid almost 1k for a scam artist but refused to do 250 lmao
I just realized there’s an Uncle Iroh funko pop on the desk when they were searching the houses! That’s so sweet
Love these videos
997$ for a simple banishing. I know people also charge for their divination services but that much? 💀  I love the way you filmed this though. Great job
this is absolutely amazing
Iroh funko in the back
Im quite impressed . I have a movie that needs to be produced if you are interested hit me up. It a true story
24:30 this shot is beautiful
Awesome work
" How do ghosts feel about meth " - Rhett 2023
he is here becose of his rub some bacon on it song
I loved Link’s reaction to the things that lady said.
oh so y’all actors now? 💀💀
Aww RIP Rhett and Link. Now, is the fire pit fixed yet?
Just finally got to watching this and WOW. Can believe how quickly this went from a funny reality sketch to a short horror film that I was IMMEDIATELY into. SO amazing. Please keep this channel rolling Rhett and Link!
absolutely love these videos keep it up !!
i think you guys should team up with ryan and shane from ghost files
I would have died if the second extermeownator unmasked themselves as Jane from the energy clearing service 😂
27:14 he said the F word
I LOVED this so much!
The funniest thing too me is two men naked in the hot tub yet won’t share a bed with their buddies. Lolllll
I believe in ghosts. I do not believe in Jane.
I took a year break from this channel and came back to this masterpiece!! Bravo!! The ending gave me chills! I literally didn’t expect that film quality at all!
Imagine being the owners of that house finding out you had 29 ghosts and 4 portals to hell the entire time you lived there…. 😂
I can’t believe there are people who support themselves by “clearing” homes of ghosts over the internet…
Just when I think they could never outshine digging a medium size hole, they do something like this! Genius. "Unhaunted house", this is front page material.
Love the vids on the channel lately
I love that they just play hide and seek lmfao
This is hands down an absolute masterpiece of a video and the way those last few scenes were intense I just couldn’t stop laughing omg this is a masterpiece
The recent videos on this channel give me such Rhett and Link: Commercial King vibes and I couldn't be more into that if I tried!
If that’s a ecobee thermostat going to setting test mode and run it in cool because 77 is to damn hot and I know the owner is controlling it from his phone😂
Love that this turned into reality tv
Oh boy funny
The way Link looks at the camera after saying “Meth activity?” 3:52
Love love loved this video !! ❤
I came here from the Facebook song
That was so impressive i was expecting a silly little video
11:00 I'm sorry, SHE WHAT!? SHE CASTED FIREBALL!?!? How do i learn this spell???
These are just freaking awesome. I love you guys ❤
Finally able to watch this and it’s so great!
Jane is a joke in itself 😂
26:00 was a nice touch. Great call back to Halloween, and overall the extermeonater looked alot like Michael Myers
You guys are brilliant. I want to see you guy actually create a movie of any kind. I would pay top dollar to watch it!!!!!!!!
Holy shit my jaw was on the FLOOR for this one!!!!
that lady sent ghosts to heaven over wifi. interesting.
Why was the cinematic part with the mouse in the house game more scarry than the five nights at Freddy's movie haha.

Omg omg this was amazing top to bottom. When this shit took a turn for the dark I was like WHHHAAAAATTT
Fr tho I NEEDYOU TO ACTUALLY GHOST HUNT WITH SAM AND COLBY PLEASE!!
I would like to submit an application for literally anything R & L would like me to say I did for the low, discount fee of $900 even. I promise I will successfully say that I did the thing they want.
I think this is my favorite video ever made by you guys. I love everything about it - the way it starts with such a bizarre idea, the ridiculous consultation, the absurd rental terms, the hot tub call, and then the way the video morphs into something totally different from the beginning with the change of the aspect ratio…*chefs kiss* you guys are creative geniuses. Keep it up. I’ll be here for what ever you guys come up with.
Comedians make the best horror movies and this proves it. Yall should really consider a full length horror movie.
The return of Rhett and link has been legendary
so when is the movie coming out?
True brave warriors.
This is exactly what I needed, I have had a crappy week, and watching y’all has me cracking up 😂 thank you ❤
Oh the drama!!! Lol well produced!
You paid for her to want  to hot tub with you hahahaha😂
Highlarious!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 unhaunted 😂😂😂😂😂
That call with Jane (Ghost Lady) was hilarious!
Links glasses are way too foggy for this.
This must have been rhetts idea
THE VOICEMAIL LMFAOOOOOOO
Grave Encounters: Rhett & Link Edition
I want 1000$ to mentally pew pew at demon holes (over zoom)
👏👏👏👏👏greatness
WTF I LAUGHED SO MUCH LMAO I HAVEN'T LAUGH LIKE THAT IN A WHILE THIS WHOLE VIDEO IS A PERFECT COMEDY AND THE SKIT AT THE END IS THE PERFECT WAY TO END IT I THINK THIS IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE WORK OF YA'LL
Why does it feel like they are throwing shade at Ryan and Shane from Watcher? 😂😂💀💯
This was better than like half the Hollywood movies I’ve seen this year, I’m speechless
I would watch a series of Rhett and Link ghost hunting all day
daddy link
They should make a movie lol
The biggest crime is that it was 77 degrees in that house!
stop firing radio at the plant ur gonna kill it
I’ve actually seen a black blob… and she is right, they’re usually up on the ceiling or in a corner.
Why do all of their new videos end with being cinematic masterpieces!?!
I effing enjoyed this bunch of nothing
I want a Rhett and Link movie now 😂 You guys are awesome 😂
Well that was fckn awesome. The production quality is just amazing
i do not usually comment on videos, but this on this one i had to. this video was ABSOLUTELY hilarious! i haven't laughed to a youtube video for a long time but rhett, link, and the crew are genuises! kudos, all! keep up the good videos.
Loved. So well done, fr!
that lady watched ghost fighter
The fact that even casual GMM fans aren't watching these is sad they are amazing. 500k views is great but this should have at least 3M
Won’t use colored ink. Pays portal lady $997.
This was not ghost hunters, this was ghost hunted
Why on earth did he stick the watch back in the hot tub? 😂😂😂
The best voicemail ever
I like how ghosts wasn’t what you needed to be worried about 🤪
Should of just got Shane and Ryan to have a look at the houses
Rhett and Link need to start making full-length films. That horror sketch they made with the record played backwards and the creepy woman in the forest could have easily been made into a proper movie.
10/10 would watch the movie just from the trailer 🤣
God I love this channel
I was curious about that website so I typed in an address where my mom died horrifically to the point where carpets had to come out and walls replaced. The house was not listed so if you care about that sort of thing that webiste might not be reliable 😂
well at least now Rhett and Link's ghosts have the house to themselves!
Not as scary as their last spooky short, but this was so well done! The fact that they went back into the house for the sheets and dishes lmao
That lady is crazy........ xD
that ending was amazing!
Wasn’t Jane on an episode of GMM ? She looks awfully familiar 😂
This is like a better version of The Office.
THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECES OF ART ON THIS WEBSITE.
did she just invite them into the hot tub? 12:17
"and we can talk in the hottub" had me rolling
Guys this lady is a fraud!! I follow the Paranormal and I've never heard of any of the processes that she mentioned. She is not for real
a very good documentary on BS jobs xD
This is actually hilarious considering I'm always watching sam and colby, overnight, twin paranormal, the paranormal files, OmarGoshTv, and a few more. I'm always down for a haunted, unhaunted, unparanormal, paranormal investigation. 😂  25:23 this is actually really good what the hell 😳
I love every second of the new content on this channel! Watching you guys be truly creative truly brings joy! You guys are dope 💪🏼🥰
i loved this
Wait this video is amazing
Dude the voice mail and the watch frying has me crying 😭😂
literally spit my coffee out at 19:36 lmaooo
I cannot _stress_ how much I love this video
Absolutely loved this Rhett and Link, u deserve more credit!! To u and the team - THANK YOU
This deserves every view it gets.
Loved when they took a hot naked shower together
You guys are just “domestic partners”
Pffft
This was so entertaining it’s giving the office vibes I LOVE IT
This was perfect. I am very late to seeing the video, but it was perfection. Love watching you guys!
Rhett has some very pointy elbows
I live for the lighting of this. This is so high quality. Like an actual documentary.
Yesssss. We love a spooky video from gmm.
“I had to fireball em” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The real horror was the thermostat on 77 degrees Fahrenheit 🥵
Next time hire a second ghost getter and see what each says about the same house
This concept is genius 😂
How amazing! What a twist for the last few min. Loved it!!
The scariest part of this video was the thermostat set at 77°
dude why was this actually terrifying
Off camera they probably are dying of laughter that they paid 997 dollars for that joke 😂😂😂
I loved this, great jobs guys!
i don't think i've ever seen ghost hunting with the sun up lol
I like how I just casually turns into a horror movie
These have been awesome. The time and effort you are putting into the videos is amazing. The paying a thousand bucks for internet ghost purge but going back in to strip the sheets ans load the dishwasher was the cherry on top
Respect the ATCQ jumper
Love your horror shows, you must heel doing this! So creative and unique. I got scared!
Dear Rhett and Link, Please make a full length thriller movie. I will pay you in excessive amounts of photos of my adorable dogs. Or cats. I have both. Please please please I need it, A fan
the cinematic shots at the end were crazy
it would have been so sick if they got jane to play the killer. i was praying on my hands and knees for a shot of her taking the mask off and laughing maniacally
I saved this video to watch on Halloween and I'm so glad I did. This was awesome, y'all!
The horror section was expertly done. Bravo fellas what a fun watch
Tribe called quest shirt goes crazy
The transition from regular video to cinema was masterful!
Why does Link always without fail shine any flashlight in his possession straight into Rhett’s eyes 😂😂😂
“in oxnard!” “herblhurbl!!” and the voicemail 😭😭 10/10
Wow this lady is a dork no?
Even if these videos never achieve the types of views they get on GMM, I hope they recognize how truly iconic this is and how much we appreciate them. These short films aren't just peak R&L, this is peak all-time YouTube content that'll looked back upon decades from now with unanimous praise for its pure authenticity, ingenuity, and creativity. Award-worthy content.
I would love for you guys to collab with Sam and Colby and go to a ‘haunted’ location!!!!!
did anyone else notice the Uncle Iroh funko pop figure by their laptop?????
watching rhett an an link get scammed by a sweet old lady was hilarious!!!!
I’ve been watching gmm for years now but this is the first Rhett and Link video I’ve seen. This is absolutely amazing. New favourite channel
I hope they made their money back off that psychic.
So glad this channel is back! It has the same soul as before!
Masterpiece 😆
Lmao. Link. "Spiritual spackle" and his snark over paying almost $1000 to some crazy lady. 😂😂😂😂😂
Legit, I think you got visited by Michael Myers’ grandson…Meowchael Meowyers. (I’m sorry)
Ngl I’m anxiously looking forward to “Rhett and Link Visit 229 Sex Offenders”
I love how Rhetts hair swoops so beautifully... I'm going to call him Mr Revlon 😉
this was awesomeeee
Loved this
I went from dying laughing (pun intended) when they both put on the costumes to immediately on edge and looking away when the murder appeared. This was so good, but also the thermostat at 77?!? That was the scariest part.
i need more thought out voicemails like this
This was crazy good! The cinematography,the plot,the comedy 🤯 Bravo boys & team! 👏🏻🎬🎉
This was awesome. 😂 I was wondering if they'd mention the sheets and dishwasher. ❤
I loved this! This was the most Rhett and Link, Rhett and Link have ever been!   I think the last few videos came close. But this was it. They just perfected the construct of a R&L video I had in mind.
Need to see them collab with Sam and Colby
That’s gotta be the longest voice message in history 😂 lol  You guys crack me up lol 😂
The house may be unhaunted, but that game was cursed.
Wait, so the whole thing was scripted!? That was truly so good! Amazing writing!'
Genius!!!
Love it, great halloween vid
I was really hoping that you guys actually bought this house and had it as an Airbnb for the fans to come rent😂
I like how they come up with ideas no one else would ever come up with
The sound design in this alone is worth the price of admission! Great work, everyone!
I am so used to not hearing you guys curse, and every time it happens it feels weird even though it shouldn't because y'all are grown asf lol. But this was a fun video and i'm happy this was my introduction to this channel :)
I'm just waiting for the horror movie written by Rhett and Link! 🤞🤞
This was AMAZING!!!!
Chef’s Kiss boys😂❤
Jane is a Crack pot.   They got ripped off for sure.
Absolutely PERFECT covering all genres!!
uOFA
I seriously thought either the "killer" had already gotten to Link & switched places with him or he was going to turn on Rhett when he said "Let the hunt begin." at  23:45. His voice sounded so ominous.
truly nothing else like this out there right now - i am so in love with this seres of videos this year
That was incredible
i literally laughed out loud when link said "i can't see shit in this mask."
stayed at a b and b and one of the rules was "do not touch the boat"
this made me laugh and thankfully taught me how to ward off ghosts and also had me on the edge of my seat I love your videos!
the twists at these videos always make watching worthwhile so creative and entertaining!! so well written I luv it
I really didn't expect to see rhat movie like twist at the end! I was sitting thinking thag this would be another one of their funny skits where they would ahg around in a new house being Rhett & Link. But then, when the lights went off, boy did Rhett & Link show their tallent in the most entertaining way possible only by Rhett & Link! Love these guys! Good Mythical Morning and More have been my daily routing for years and these videos on this channel is such a welcome addition to the routine.
The owner’s room is opened at the end!
Let us know if you need a new watch. 🤣Super appreciate the surprise support!
This video was so good I am obsessed with it. Made me want to watch a horror movie. Super super super good.
So Link and Rhett go to the most unhaunted looking house you can possibly imagine😂
I don’t know about Jane…The whole fire ball thing just made me think of a scenario from a D&D campaign 😬 😂😂😂😂
That ghost lady is so full of 💩 😂
I love these Rhett&Link sketches. The writing, the acting, the directing, the creativity. They put so much work into what they do, even if it's just something on the side for them, it's inspiring. All these skit ideas are so original, they could be actually turned into movies. I don't know how they never run out of ideas. Everything that comes out of this channel is a masterpiece. I hope they never stop working on this channel because this is where their creativity actually shines.
Was not expecting this to be so good, don’t wanna say any specifics to spoil it for others but hollyyyyy
Yo the end of this was FIRE. Yall should make a movie, beautiful filming/editing and acting. Please do it
imagine this: rhett and link movie on the big screen
Would've been much more fun to go to an actual haunted house...
20:20 The way Rhett puts that actively short-circuiting watch back into the hot tub with them, like he's about to give the house two new ghosts to replace all the ones Jane got rid of, lol XD. I'm dying ;) hahaha
Best video ive watched on YouTube in years!❤😂 literally love Rhett and link and the entirety of this content, could watch it every day. Thanks for the time and effort put into this as it was super enjoyable to watch 🤙🏼💙
HAHAHAHA THAT WAS AWESOME!
need to share a bed for full experience.
Is that an Uncle Iroh funko pop on their desk? Omg do they like ATLA?
“They should’ve paid for part of it” 😂😂😂
I wasn't sure about this one but I know these guys mean business when it comes to entertainment. I have never had so much fun 😂
They should have called in the Watcher boys to help!
😂😂 you guys are ridiculous
I love y’all but you’re gonna be opening doorways man -_- beleiiiive me
Cinematic masterpiece truly
Why did the mouse game scene feel like a real horror movie😭 acting is on point!!
I got so close to giving up and the dumb little board game cabinet thing got me on board.  HA!  The shoe gag had me rolling and then the damn bnb fee at the end...   Perfect.  Bravo to the both of you.
Sam and Colby x Rhett and Link collab needs to happen
I need a collab like this with Ryan and Shane from watcher😭
"Wait!  We gotta load the dishwasher!" - LOL why does that seems like something Link would legitimately say in that situation. 🤣
That lady just stole 1k from yall 😂
Rhett and Link need to pair up with Sam and Colby to do some ghost hunting!
If I were them, I would've been trying so hard not to laugh during the psychic. lmao I don't, not believe in some level of psychic abilities but history points to some definite conclusions about Catholicism. The fact that they colonized and forceful converted people and stole a lot of their beliefs from pagans, Celtics, etc. Also, the fact that some of the most influential Catholics in history lied about being profits since its creation, in order to keep the men in power and also suppress women. And people like Ed and Lorrane warren were frauds and faked hauntings. In one instance they were paid to say that a man was possessed to get him off for murderer. (It didn't work).  So, to say you can connect to people that probably never existed or were probably just regular humans, is funny. But honestly as long as her intention is strong and her belief is strong, I see no reason that it wouldn't work just the same. But also 1,000 feels like a scam. lol
The uncle iroh figure was a great cameo
Long version should be sent to the Sundance film festival
This genuinely got my heart rate up
everyone: sees knife then sees Link  also everyone: *panics*
The best part of any day is watching these guys!
"Mrs Pacman has ghosts in it." 😆
You guys have outdone yourself with this one.  Excellent!
Zak Bagans is shaking in his big black boots.
A $1000?! I'ma have to pretend to be a ghost whisperer 😂😂
Lmk if you need me to clear houses for u
Rhett and Link manage to find the most useless/fake careers in these videos
The ghost psychic out here like “FIREBALL!!! FIREBALL!!! FIREBALL!!!” 😂😂😂😂
That.  Was.  BRILLIANT!
this was incredible
I love how spooky this is getting though
please make a video with Knj🥲
This was truly amazing 😂😂😂 really a great job all around.
I loved this! Even without all the laughing in the background you guys are still funny as hell! I cant imagine life n mornings without you guys! 😂😂😂❤
I used my finger like a gun an shot fireballs at it and made pew pew noises 😂
This was awesome ! Keep it up guys this is great work, hilarious  I can’t wait to see what’s next
It makes me so mad that Mr beast gets like 200x the amount of views as this, it's so well done my god
Jane should be in conjuring/the nun, she could have easily defeated valak and other ghosts and demons
They should invite Shane and Ryan
nooooo the acting was too good i got upset when link was stabbed
As an attorney, I can say with the utmost confident that a *really good* attorney will cost much more than $330/hour. 😂 And at least an attorney works in the realm of reality.
10:28 LINKS SLOW TURN AND LOOK AT THE CAMERA 😭
Yoooo okay for real tho, I was NOT expecting this to turn into like a scary movie. A very WELL DONE scary movie that actually scared me a bit 😂 Well done guys, as always ❤
They should sell that game idea
Yeah, send the guy who's bleeding to grab the sheets. That $250 is gone.
I think it's fairly obvious that Jane did it.
Rhett wearing a biosphere2 shirt is actually so cool
Yas
YESSSSS! This is the sketch comedy stuff of Youtube's golden age that I have been missing!!!
Man the end of this is Rhett&Link at their absolute best. Seriously should consider doing a legit horror video. We’ll wait however long it takes, take all my money!🤣
I was not expecting that game!!😂😂
“big ass game” made me LOL
4:01 broooo whose is the Uncle Iroh Funko Pop? Knowing one of them (or possibly both) not only like AtLA, but also like Iroh enough yo have a Funko of him is hella cool.
Why did the cinematic quality jump so high for that weird ass game of hide and seek? 😂 Tis the season, I guess
these guys need their own movie
This video was beautiful
That Michael Myers cat had me terrified! This was absolutely amazing! & That ending was perfect! ❤
Love this!!!😂❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Rhett and Link, you need to go to an actual haunted location.
Literally so good! This, paired with GMM shows how versatile Rhett and Link are, and I am here for it!
WHAT. I loved this but also wHAT. Lolol
SO DAMN GOOD!!!!!! and a damn good rhett f bomb too
The more concerning thing is how many sex offenders were within a 3 mile radius .I'd be more scared of that than ghosts lol
I love these new videos. They feel so you, while still being so different. I love that they let you guys play with form and genre in the ways only you guys can!
Awesome!  🤣
This was awesome ❤❤❤
@20:43 i swear it looks like rhett has no pants on 🤣
Rhett and Link are so talented and entertaining. I would watch any movie that they are in if they started in one
I've watched this a few times now and only just seen the guy close the door behind them lol!
this was soooo good! chefs kiss! now i need a full 2 hour sequel please
Haha damn this transition was flawless.
Cleanser lady I feel like was prepared to give you a ghost report no matter what she actually found at a house 😂 love the finger guns
The fireball 😂😂😂
Oh my gosh I just watched the episode with Nar2Fodie XD So fun to see it pop up again
Fun note: if you go frame by frame at 11:42 when she talks about "dark blobs", there's a dark blob that appears/disappears behind her head on the left side!
"Toner is expensive." Finds only expensive rental houses.
The cinematography at the end was actually top notch. Rhett and link never fail to entertain me
imagine just waking up & hearing that voicemail 😂
Havent watched these guys in years. They're one of the few og youtubers who just keep getting better.
How do these scam artist trick people for lots of money like that
This is basically what buzzfeed unsolved has become 😂
I loved this! that slow mo hair flip of Rhett's was majestic.
Going into a meth house would be spooky enough. 🎃
Can anyone PLEASE tell me where Link got his Tribe Called Quest shirt!!
i completely forgot about nartu fodey oh my god
Even for comedic purposes I’d honestly would love a movie like this😂 it has a good plot. You guys never disappoint🫶🏼🫶🏼
The worst part about these new videos is they end way too quick :(
That was just great Y'all for real!!
This video was absolutely incredible!! One of the best they’ve made.
Rhett and Link are making such incredible shit right now. It's so exciting
Every video thats come out on this channel has absolutely been amazing
Paid a lot of money to a woman to use her imagination to close hatches and play pretend with finger guns
i like that the game is just hide and seek
This was so good! I didn’t expect that at all! Best Rhett and Link channel video!
this is such a funny and creative video idea
27:48 the real horror is that the house is set to a sweltering 77F
I knew something was fishy when the hot tub had no bubbles
Well that took an unexpected turn
THE POPLE NEED A RHETT AND LINK SHORT HORROR CHANNEL AND THE PEOPLE WANT A RHETT AND LINK SHORT HORROR CHANNEL!!!!!! THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
Rhett throwing the watch in the water is something I would’ve expected from Link, not him lmao 😭😭
Bravo! This was awesome!
"that means I get to be the exterMEOWnator next" had me cackling lolll
I thought for sure the killer was going to take off the mask and be Jane the Ghost Lady who then disappears from view after typing the house update
Lol I love this except for when they paid a scammer $997 😂
Hazel was definitely a better “horror film” than this it actually scared me, but this was an appreciated foray into Horror Comedy, really good.
Man, i've been dying for something like the Tiktok series they did, and this one is great! So glad they revived this channel 🎉
I need “meth activity” *looks at camera* saved as a short LOL
I lost it when link asked if she used spiritual spackle to close the portals 💀
That woman is such a scammer. She spilled so much BS. I didnt believe anything she said. Im huge in the paranormal. Putting black blobs in buckets  No 😂 and working with angels... BS!
BEST video EVER!!! That was the most awkward voicemail you left the ghost lady 😉 The ending was awesome 🐱🤣👍👍
Damn rest in peace Rhett and Link...weird death announcement btw
self-checkout to the underworld is something i did not know i needed but i am so grateful for
This video is so good man, especially the production i dont normally comment but the production was soo good i had to say something. You guys are incredible
Phasmophobia be like:
the paranormal (ish) show i was waiting for
Hire Nathan Fielders ghost realtor. Real deal
Perfection!!
The ending of this was amazingly done. Holy cow
My dad died in our house. Honestly there's not alot of staining. He died in sleep. But I will tell you there's always some like feeling during Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's nice. I want to think it's dad still lovingly looking over us. Those were his favorite holidays.
Im bummed these dont get more views, but im loving these videos
This is SOOO awesome!! like a movie! I'd like to see a full horror movie from you guys
Links face at 10:29 is priceless
Please do some real ghost hunting... PLEASE!
Ugh
The only thing missing from this is Cotton Candy Randy
Jane did it
"if you've got Jesus, do you need his mom?" the question that led to the Lutheran separation from the Catholic church
The production quality is top notch!
Phasmophobia Much😂?
You should have sam and Colby for your upcoming Gmm video.. if anything you're both alike with childhood friends also like Ian and Anthony... please have them over
That psychic is intensely delusional but also running the greatest grift of all time.
How much was scripted is the crazy part guys? Like it puts the whole video into question lol i love this one and the end got so artistic and atmospheric props to the editors and cinemetographers on this one
This was excellent
The production value on the video. That is all.
it seems like every vid theyve been dropping here recently ive been saying 'ok this is my new favorite main channel video'...this is nov exception. i adore this
That was pretty epic🧡
This channel has become the peak of Rhett & Link’s career, every single video is pure creative genius
Love this! Was not expecting the end.
you paid $1000 for some crack pot that believe in some magical sky daddy lmao.  If you want someone to remove spirits, most will do it free of charge for you. As soon as you seen anything over $100/session you were being ripped off.
This is the perfect content for R&L main channel
I never would have guessed that Link would have better shoulders than Rhett 😅
A "dis-carne asada taco" would probably have ghost peppers, Link...
If you’re already going to have Jesus, do you really need his mom as well 🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Idk why it got me so good when Rhett said "fire happens here....idiots" LOL
It was Jane! 😂 She knew the boys would be there!
Well, that took an unexpected turn! Loved it! So happy that you guys are making such great videos <3 Been watching your content since you started!
The A24 movie at the end was genuinely so amazing. Fantastic work to everyone involved!
this was amazing
I think it was the ghost lady all along.  She knew they were mocking her and she wasn’t gonna stand for that
I’ve been watching Rhett and Link for years. It’s amazing how talented & funny they are & somehow find the time to do everything they do! ❤❤❤
The shot at 26:51 is actually a cinematic masterpiece.
This is quality content 😂.
It was Cotton Candy Randy.
It would have been even better for me (because it is so great already) if at the end it didn't cut to Link saying "Hey Rhett" and keep the camera at Rhett when he was crouching down and talking. Then, Rhett heard the line "Hey Rhett" from the other room (and then it cut to Link finishing the line or adds something like "where are you?"), effectively suspending the fact that the person in front of Rhett was a stranger the whole time until the very end.
Didn't we already learn from "Hazel", that these two should NEVER stay in a rented home, overnight, together? At least that was my takeaway 🤣
I love this
Extensive game cabinet.   Finds one game.  LOL
I love you?   I don’t know man I got nervous.   LMAO
Anyone else forget they werent actually watching a movie and get pissed when it ended 😂😂
This is so seriously unserious. I love it.
I LOVE all the content yall are putting out on this channel
RIP
ohhhh guys this was so cool
I love how this started out as being a believable actual 'hunt' until about half way through when you realize it's actually a short movie!
I freaking love it!! I know Rhett is a big horror fan and Link is not but I think that makes for a great writing combination for the genre. I loved this and Hazel!
Links face when she was talking about working with Jesus and angels made me laugh so hard
That whole voicemail 💀😂
This. Is. Amazing.
THERES NO WAY THE PHYSIC IS SERIOUS!😂😂
I hope they continue to post in this channel. I am literally in tears from laughing so hard. So we'll done! The content on this channel is elite.
When the close up of Rhett hiding with the nose happened I really thought he was going to break out into song and sing what does the fox say
does Rhett nap everyday now?
Legend has it, they were still charged the 250.
Come to my house i feel its haunted but people say it looks friendly
Is it just me or did anyone else see a sawblade machete on the bed when Rhett is trying to fight off the attacker. ( 27:02 ) lol  😍😂
Love the video but do feel some sort of way about this almost 1k for a women to take advantage of often grieving people.
I love how this transitions from normal vlog to horror short, I was actually hooked on this! I’ll never not love the work y’all do
This was brilliant!! Such a perfect mix of comedy and suspense
So cool of them to get scammed for our entertainment
Link has a tattoo on his arm?
I'm going absolutely crazy for this video! Everything you guys have made this past year has been, by far, my favorite genre of content on the Rhett & Link channel. This one is especially incredible. I spent the last 5 minutes wishing it was the start to a new horror movie! Very proud :3
the most horrific thing about this video was the fact y’all put the thermostat on 77
Moral of the story. You're safer in a haunted house. Dead spooks are less dangerous than living ones.
Man, you guys are wicked talented!! Been watching for years!!
WHO NEEDS THE REAL WORLD ... EPIC Cinematic experience!
The end movie was absolutely amazing!
liking the video only because of the Iroh figurine.
Wow this was so good! It went from documentary to horror before you even realize it!
I'm kinda liking this new look and format of buzfeed unsolved
Me at the beginning: I won’t get scared   Me at the end:🫣
Me at the beginning: I won’t get scared   Me at the end:🫣
Ya..links face says it all at 10:28    haha...Im going to start that as a job!
loveeee it
Imagine paying $1000 for someone to make finger guns
I know a lot of people have said it but i truly cannot get over how talented Rhett and Link are!! I love watching this channel so much!
This is amazing haha!
"a whole bunch of angels" made me laugh harder than i have in awhile lmaooo
This reads as a fanfic
it's giving old RuckaRucka and i'm here for it
They paid a lady $1000 to go eat cheesies and watch tv for three hours
i thought the killer was going to be the ghost lady and then it was going to show her updating diedinhouse lol
It’s a couple of days later and I’m still just blown away by how unique and well done this is 👏
Is it like an Unsweetened tea where they sweeten it, and then take it back out again? Like was a haunted house, but it's been unhaunted?
THIS WAS AMAZING! Such a smart idea, loved it.
A cinematic masterpiece. Chefs kiss boys. 👌🏻
I'm pretty sure you did the same bit years ago. Is this your Halloween tradition?
That lady ripped them off but tried to sell it like she did a lot of work. Shame on her.
AWESOME!!!!
You guys can not stop what you are doing on this channel. This type of innovation is so inspiring.
That was awesome! Great job. Happy Halloween!👻🎃
My theory is that the murderer was the psychic lady
This is the most amazing content ever. ❤❤❤❤
Uncle iroh 🖤
Fuckin spiritual spackle 🤣
Haha That was awesome!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
24:39 😂😂😂😂😂😂
wow, the videos on this channel continue to surprise me with how great and creative they are. this is so good y’all 🤩
Dang it! I want a part 2 to this thing. 😆
You guys are just the best! Applauding you!
Hearing them cuss randomly will never not be hilarious to me for some reason 😂
i’m gonna be the one to say since nobody else has, jane is a maniac. ok cool. done. bye
Loved it
I'm just mad this wasn't longer. I would have watched a full 90 minutes of this, it was so well made and the set up was so good.
😂😂😂😂😂
My fav duo in a satire; love it!!
The psychic part had me laughing my ass off
This video idea is so freakin funny to me! I haven't even watched the video yet and I'm already laughing just at the concept lmao Genius!
When Link said “I think one of em’s a self check out” that SENT ME
When the family gets home and realize you got rid of their Guardian Angel Grandpa, they’re gonna charge an exorbitant fee to allow him to re-haunt the family home.  Twist-The ghost psychic is the Extermeownator!
Loved this one!!
I laughed, i cried, i was spooked.  This is an artistic masterpiece with a lesson too.
This was so good oh my goodness!!! Silly comedy video turned terrifying home invasion short film in a matter of minutes!! Y'all are so talented, its amazing!!
that voicemail was PAINFUL
This is so unserious 😂 this woman is a scam artist
I love getting to hear Rhett and Link actually curse like normal adults , this is my first video I've watched on this channel of theirs and I'm into it <3
“We stayed home for a video” was the second title choice for this video
That’s fuckin incredible lol
They’re so chaotic and I love it 😭😭
This was great, guys! I'd love to see more content like this-- still shocked to hear ya'll curse and I'm totally here for it ❤
Damn, I am so impressed by this.
An alternative title for this video could be: "Rhett and Link give scammers money for 30 minutes"... I love it, do it again 😂 Edit: The cinematography at the end is amazing, this whole video is truly a masterpiece
The voice mail was everything! 😂 the Rhett and Link math of not paying $250 because of sheets but paying almost $1000 to a lady to clean the house by zoom. And then the Blue House feel movie right at the last minutes 300000/10 😂😂😂😂😂❤
THIS NEEDS A SEQUEL
THE SHORT FILM WAS AMAZING!!!
27:48 It's 77 degrees in that house?? AHHHH NOOOOOOoooo!
Plot twist... Jane owned the house.
lal
That was absolutely amazing to watch well done to the while team I was hooked ! I need a sequel!!
Awesome video. Well made and had me cracking up. Gotta say though, I really enjoy your clean brand of humor. Disappointing to hear the language throughout
This is literally an excuse to document and create their own vacations. You cannot tell me otherwise.
Janes process of getting rid of energy is ...watching netflix and calling back the saps she scammed out of 1000 bucks
I don’t know if it’s your editor or cinematographer or what, but your most recents videos have been GORGEOUSLY colored. So nicely lit!
This was rad! I genuinely got sucked in and burned my dinner bit paying attention to it.  😂
The biggest horror of this was that the temperature was set to 77
honestly, amazing video. although, i do have an issue with the house being 77 degrees inside
I enjoyed how Link couldn’t keep it together after Black blobs he reached his limit 😂
Color catridges are so expensive, I feel so validated by Link in this episode! If millionaire youtubers can't afford them, how are we normies supposed to!
The way this turned into a highbudget film at the end
the Uncle Iroh pop figure 🥹😍 3:39
Nice ending, kept waiting for something to happen was not disappointed.
the way i was giggling and then not giggling but shaking in fear….. i fucking loved that
F
This is truly one of the unhaunted houses of all time
Why is it impossible to breathe quietly when hiding lol
that voicemail was about the funniest thing I've seen all day lool
I always wonder if these psychic types really believe they have this power or if they're knowingly swindling people.
These shots when Rhett is hiding are gorgeous ❤
sooo... the owner did it.
1000$ ... I'm in the wrong industry.
Rhett reading the game instructions like they weren't just the directions on how to play hide and seek lololol
A MASTERPIECE!! Probably my favorite video they've made yet.
Their transition from vlogging to scripted is SO good. Like not me thinking that cat and mouse game was legit until the killer appeared… this was fantastic.
This is actually amazing bro, really did not expect like a full blown short horror film at the end of this but I loved it! I wonder how long it took to make it lol- Rhett and Link are truly special and unique and I love this!
gary gulka would be so proud.
I loved this so much; everything about it!   Here's to hoping both of you write and co-star in a full-length comedy horror movie! Happy Halloween fellas! 🎃👻🤩
to think some people Believe what the women says is true.....
The ability for Rhett and Link to both be themselves while also being mid-skit is what makes this unique balance between reality and creativity that sucks me in every time! This has been my favorite to date!
people usually die where meth's involved or cooked 😂
This video has to be my fav rhett and link video 😭😭
That ending was amazing! I can’t seem to shake the feeling that Jane was a scam though…
I was not expecting Link to have a botanical half sleeve
Came for the humor, stayed for the murder... What a great video!
Probably the best one yet! These videos are works of creative genius!
LOVE this lol
I didnt know they were such mocking people
Really incredible work, guys. This was amazing.
I loved it, thank you!!
This channel is rare uploads but I love all the content here!
loved the voicemail bit :)
The scariest thing in this entire video is the thermostat being set to 77° in California 🤢
It's wild I've been with this show since the NC days and they just keep getting better and better. Love what you guys do and I'm proud to be a mythical beast. Also, a little curious to see Rhett go back to short hair idk why bc I know what he looks like but a restart would be interesting.
Third time watching this is a gem Rhett and Link!
The hot tub is a safe haven. I never thought I would hear that. The last part was just a masterpiece :)
This is so much better than an actual horror movie
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸Please support the independence of Palestine for the people and children there:))
Free PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
That scared me so badly that when they went back into the house to strip the sheets and load the dishwasher, i yelled 'no!' so loud that i scared my fiance and my dog who were sleeping.
Y'all are way too good at making horror, this is AMAZING!!!
yall dont have to make a video just to have a sleepover
Lord Beerus is goinna get you.
My neighbor died in the apartment next to mine, and sad to say, his apartment has remained untouched for about 2 years, except for them boarding up his side. Its really really creepy and extremely sad. Not to mention, i am 'sensitive' to the paranormal.
The biggest horrors were the AirBnB rules and the cost of the psychic.
I LOVE MY FATHERS
I seriously wish I could click the like button on a video multiple times.
TABRAK TABRAK MASUKKKK
somebody get zak baggins in here
This is hilarious
You should rename the channel adventures with Rhett & link btw I love all of these eps
“Unhaunted” seems like one of those parody tv shows they’d show one of the characters watching on Gravity Falls
Didn't realise Link got so much ink 🥰
Ha, ha, spoiler, instead of a un-haunted, they ended up in a slasher-house instead.
But did the Etermeownator dink it and then sink it?
Brilliant!!!!!!!
Another great short film!!
What I learned from this video... It's easy to scam people out of $997...
i NEED more of this
jane quit her job right after this
Time to go on a ghost files episode with shane and
Bruhhhhh
loving the new content so much!! Definitely got to share with my friends
She is literally the doom slayer guy of the psychic world 🔥👻
Aint no team beating her support team
I'll give this a like. Look, they actually made a thing. Was it great? part of it. Was it Rhett and Link? Yep! I'm glad to see they are putting this channel to use by doing some unique content and they actually take their time between shoots to produce something unique. YT is pretty full of garbage and we accept low effort work way to easily.
The scariest thing in this short is it being 77° on a film set 😂
I was expecting the 2nd extermeownator to take their mask off and be Jane 😂
it’s criminal how well executed this whole thing was lol
Rhett and link are the one who can make the most boring concept into the greatest YouTube video ever
This type of content is artistically awesome. It’s like a vlog, scripted sketch comedy, but shot like a real movie or documentary. It’s a perfect mix of what makes Rhett and Link Internet pioneers.
Aw man y'all should have done this with Post Malone!
It's STILL weird hearing them swear, even if I am an adult!
this seemed like a fun episode....till they got to the ghost phychic lady.......i hope them paying her lika a grand was a joke, if it wasn't that just hurts my heart and taints my enjoyment of this. i might need to watch another of their videos to clear my mind
Oh my freaking goodness!!!! Loved it!!! This was awesome !!!!!! You guys really outdid yourselves !!!!! You guys are the best!!
Link was so mad that they dropped a grand on the spirit lady 😂 I need to run whatever scam that lady’s running 😂
I had to pause the video to laugh at the fact that Rhett bought a cheap little watch microphone and then the camera pans to their crew with the giant boom mic 😭😭
"Give our best to your staff; Jesus and Mary, Michael and the other one" I died 😂
Absolutely loved this!
Me over here turning the volume down on my phone when the game started and the lights went out. 😆😯😩👻
I don’t know how you two and everyone else involved keep outdoing yourselves with each one of the new og channel videos 🫶
Who was the killer chase ?
Damnit they got me completely! I should’ve known when it looked more like one of their old vlogs after they got off the phone in the hot tub. I could’ve watched a feature length movie of this! That was amazing guys!
Hiding in the comments? Couldn't be me. Amazing job.
Been a GMM fan since chia Lincoln and love that they have brought back this channel. These videos are amazing, funny and unexpected. Please keep them coming
I love how they can make staying in an unhaunted house creepy
Only recommendation is to change the Thumbnail to something that looks more like a “Documentary of an un-haunted house”
This is the best video you guys have ever made 🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Entertaining, fun, original, funny AND it felt like a MOVIE 🍿 Cannot believe how amazing this was
THIS. WAS. SO. GOOD. I literally want to watch a Rhett and Link full length horror movie 😭
The scariest part was the fact that the house was at 77°
Yall i fell asleep when link was counting down and woke up to link saying Rhett after getting hurt boy howdy was I in for a confused surprise
What if Stewart wanted those ghosts and portals to hell?
Whoever did the sound design / engineering needs a raise. This was awesome. So many cinematic elements.
The voicemail was hilarious 🤣 😂
Alternate title Rhett and link get scammed lol 😂
You guys are amazing. I've been watching every single one of these new videos, and I love them so much!!!
literally so perfect.
Awesome!!
The "board game" was just hide-and-seek in costumes
Y’all this was it … for real I was so pleasantly surprised by the turn of events and it was really entertaining!!
Well, there definitely weren't any ghosts in that house
Why are they so good at thiss??!!
I loved this one
I loved Jane's reaction to Link's discarne asada joke 8:00 😂
this is a prime example why you guys are my favorite creators
What if they wanted their house to be haunted and you messed it up
Nartu Fody Strikes again.
Where did this man get that tribe long sleeve I gotta have it
id watch a whole horror comedy movie from mythical
I'm too high for this
Very small detail but link wearing a A Tribe Called Quest crew neck made my whole day lol
You guys definitely need to team up with Shane and Ryan for a ghost hunt. Y'all would have a blast
IT WAS THE PSYCHIC!!
I literally died when Link said, "Wait, we have to strip the sheets and load the dishwasher."  Keep 'em comin' fellas!
I love you guys. Been subscribed to this account since way before GMM. Ive always preferred this account and I’m so happy you’re uploading here
Brilliant! Encore!
All the foreshadowing from the vlog portion was so well done
Where did they get that wallpaper? It's beautiful!
If there are that many ghost 'type energies' and that many portals to Hell in just one house then all i can say is that clearly that's fine then. Im pretty sure this lady is completely messing up the spiritual balance to the universe by interfering in something that must be simply the natural way of things - seen as it's caused no harm to anyone up to now.
Sarcastically ghost hunting??? Shane Madej would approve or sue for impeding on his IP not sure which
🤣🤣
That was a lot creepier than I expected it to be!!  Only they could make a cat mask scary.
Digging Links Tribe Called Quest shirt! Didn't expect him to be a fan of that group. TIL
Dude.. this is amazing! They created better tension that 80% of all the horror movies released now a days
well, now we know why the door was locked upstairs, the killer needed a place to hang out for a while
these videos are superb, I enjoy them so so much
I love how most of these videos are just them exposing absolutely ridiculous people from the LA area.
Does anyone else suddenly need another Watcher/R&L crossover where they ghost hunt together?
Genius. Fucking genius. I went from laughing to scared so fast.
Okay but WHYYYYY do I need a pt 2-48?!
Rhett at 24:55🥵😍🤯. You're welcome 😅
omg this is just like [redacted] which was Amy Nelson, Mark fischbach, and Ethan Nestors channel unfortunately it was deleted after 365 days. Now this is a new one that isn't gonna die and is going to make so many people happy. This will fill the hole of entertainment we all have since that fateful day. Thank you guys for being here and I've been a fan since 2013 ish. Rhett and Link have helped so many people in their dark times by being people we can laugh with. (Just don't give link a knife)
Rhetts "love you" While leaving a voice mail, got me.
I love this video it was perfect they are amizing actors and youtubers but i have to say that cat mask is creepy
Haha the Iroh pop sitting there, giving you all the wisdom and guidance.
I’m so glad you guys started making videos on this channel again. This is my favorite Rhett and link content
The part that was filmed through the mask was similar to Michael Myers in Halloween. Very creepy and well done.
11:20 comedic gold
I’d love to see them go to an actual haunted house.
i was waiting for someone to reveal that the video was a prank and the old lady was an actress because holy shit theres no way she believes what shes saying
Gives me some Donnie Darko vibes, but way better.
alternate title. "We get scammed by a weirdo over zoom"
wow thay lady was nuts
Cinema, absolute Cinema
Link rocking A Tribe Called Quest sweatshirt. 👌🏼
Well now you need to stay in an actually haunted house for comparison!
Link is wildin printing those little pictures with no color. Lmao
This is literally the best thing to ever exist on the Internet 🤣
more of this please.  pleeeeaseee say theres a part 2 comming making this a series
The way that killer ran off had serious David Hill energy 😂
The real crime in this video is that the thermostat was set to 77 degrees 🥵
This is a masterpiece
This was awesome!!
THE FACT THAT FOR ME IT AUTOPLAYED RHETT AND LINK’S FUNERAL AFTER THIS VIDEO! I AM DECEASED!
Incredibile. I loved every second.
This had great production value, but I still get uncomfortable every time I hear Rhett OR Link curse (even tho I do it all the time lol)
Amazing stuff !!
I freakin loooved this ❤ you guys 🥹🥹🥹
The best part was when they were talking to Jane. I kept laughing hysterically. This is the stuff I love that Rhett and Link do. I miss the vlogs.
It was so cool when it cut to that cinematic film style. We’ve been treated with a second Rhett & Link horror short film and I am very happy about it.
I'm loving that they brought back this channel! And I'm loving the videos with a paranormal vibe. I wish they'd do a "for real" ghost hunting video! I'd love to see Rhett and Link travel to a well-known haunted house and spend the night there!
Please tell me the killer mouse was Jane!! 😂
This was great to watch, but that lady was full of a bunch of hoopla 😂 $1k for that is insane
I would kill to tag team with the ghoul boys for an episode
I knew Rhett and Link have great horror chops since the whole Hazel Macon thing, so I can't say I wasn't expecting them to go all Jordan Peele by the end of this. Great job as always; instant classic!
well rip rhett and link, they followed through the rules and ended up as ghosts themselves
I can't believe I got to watch that for free... best scary movie I've seen all year
You 2 should defo go to an actual ghost house experience... even take the ggm crew
I don’t know if the scariest part was the thermostat set to 77 or them paying $1000 for nothing 😂
How long does a clearing take? Most full energy clearings take anywhere from two to three hours and are done remotely from my office in Bend, OR. It depends on the size of the space and surrounding property. My longest was around 12 hours for an 18,000 sq ft compound comprised of several houses and buildings. I’ve also spent about five hours clearing a large 3 story restaurant with 60 employees, some of whom I also cleared. From her site lol. She claims she works with other guides, but another site states she's the only employee. Why cater and support such a conman? This kind of disgusts me.
Part two please
I can’t tell if Rhett was being serious or if it was an accident/introvert thing when he went “love you”😂😂😂😂
Where is sam and Dean Winchester?
i know its a bit but how funny it would be if this was an actual haunted bed and breakfast that made their money being as such and now have a legitimate mulitmillion dollar case they can file against you for clensing their home?
I thought I left awkward voicemails 😂
So, when is Hollywood signing you guys?
This was genius 👏👏
This was awesome
Omg that short film should be made into  full length movie!
So glad that Rhett and Link get to be this creative!
Wow.  Another masterpiece.  I’m oddly proud of the work you guys continue to turn out… absolutely genius, and genuinely very scary!  The cinematography is incredible in this one 👏
The most horrifying part is the thermostat being at 77° 🥵
You guys should ghost hunt with the ghoul boys from Watcher!
Loved the turn of events! Was not expecting it at all! Rhett and Link are great actors and the editing of the scene where Rhett looks at the knife was awesome! Perfect effects, cuts, and edits! Love their short films and music videos!
Quackery.
You guys should really go ghost hunting with Shane and Ryan 😏
As a diehard "Halloween" fan, I really appreciated the shot through the eye holes near the end. I think this might be the best video on this channel. Brilliant!
Link makes the most brilliant comedic choices. Like, the way he dealt with sitting in the hot tub, the funniest possible choices.
I Lovveee these !! Excited to see some mythical movies 🎥
Never know what to expect. Love it!!😂😂
Holy shir wasn’t expecting a movie at the end!!! That was incredible! 😮
Why is it 77 degrees in that house?!?
Thanks to Melatonin and epilepsy medication, my dreams are super visually memorable. I watched this vid out of one eye while falling asleep the other night. Never finished it. Watching it wide awake this afternoon, I think the vague memories from this vid fed it. I ended up having a dream about Rhett and Link that was a ton of fun. You Guy's were hosting an escape room from a haunted house featuring a bunch of fan's. The escape from the room was pretty easy, but in order to win you had to make it from the room, across a southern style mud run, to the finish line before any of the other teams. I didn't win, the sexier team did, but because I was attempting to juggle throughout the entire mud run, I still got an honorable mention. I woke up before I saw what the prize was lol. Not gonna lie, I wish epilepsy gave me enough props for Make-A-Wish, cuz I'd love to meet you guys and do a random GMMore video with you lol.
You guys should be on ghost files with Ryan and Shane lol 😂
I did not at all expect that this would turn into a short horror film. Obsessed!! So glad this channel has been relaunched!!
Its the slow mp hair flip from Rhett for me
Spoiler Alert: The most terrifying moment is the thermostat at 77. 🫣😳😱🥵😵🪦
That is the BEST voicemail. I wish I had voicemails like that from my clients.
That ending was so hilarious 😂❤
Now you need to go stay in a haunted location!!
I swear these new videos are easily one of my favorite things. Along with everything Rhett and Link but still
is this a nod at sam and colby 😂
I always love these types of films of you :D Just something simple turned into something amazing... a piece of art. Like digging a hole, taking a nap etc. Love it!
2:12 ELABATORR
I wanna sequel. I want to find out who the killer is!!
People talking alot of trash in the comments about a psychic CHARGING for her services.... pretty sure if one of yall houses were severely haunted, like weird/unexplained creepy things happening ALL the time. Yeah you're either going to move. OR pay whatever priest, exorcist, shaman or psychic will charge. So cut the ignorant nonsense. Thanks.
The pure genius in this is that when you’ve stayed in an Air BnB you’re familiar w the rules and the game cabinet, but you still never see the game part coming..
obssesed with Link's "the low end theory" jumper,, amazing taste from him
I realize I went to college to be a registered nurse and could make 1000 bucks doing hooey phooey wow
I don’t think you needed the last shot of saying you died in the house but I laughed my ass off at everything else! Thank you for being you!
So original. This is the best thing I’ve seen on YouTube in a while.
That really took a turn I didn't expect, I love it. I never know what I'm in for when I get a notification for this channel, you guys keep me on my toes. I love what you've been doing here, these recent videos have been so unique, I haven't seen anything like them. The production value is so high too, I always love the cinematography so much. Keep up the amazing work guys, this is so cool!!
I need Rhett and link to guest star on an episode of watcher's ghost files
Years later Jessie and Christie come to the home where their respective husbands died in an attempt to communicate with them.
Homestly who builds a house with sky windows facing the front of the house  ?? Really??
You guys at Mythical are getting extremely good at making horror films, it's amazing.
They didn’t pay for the lady to read energies. They paid $997 to an actor. Cause there is NO WAY.
Also, that mouse hunt game. Incredible.
Wildly funny and highly entertaining as always
That voicemail was everything lol. I love this content. 😂❤
The fact y’all wasted a grand on some psychotic lady is insane 😭
Wish they didn't promote that one website. $12 per search and its not accurate, lol
The business man and the boy have done it again
The end part about not wanting to pay $250 and going back in to strip the sheets and load the dishwasher was gold😂
electrical device starts sizzling... Rhett's reaction: throw it into the water we are sitting in 🤣
I need more of these videos!!!
77 degrees I'm that house.... I'd be sweating my ass off.
This was incredible!
Kinda has unus annus vibes
Hahahahahaha
The next time you guys want to waste money just give it to me!
THE DRAMATIC HAIR FLIP @ 26:37 😂
I love how they successfully left an old lady the most awkward voice mail of all time 💀
This is just such a inspiring piece of art 😂
I really love that I never know how the video is going to end or what direction they’re going to go. This was great.
Yes yes yes! That was masterful
Man I wish you guys would do more of these!
I love these!
More like Jane scam lady
Was not expecting that!!... 😳
Dang RIP Rhett and Link :(
The fundamentally basic FACT..... that we are ALL eternal/powerful balls of energy aka souls, should be known by EVERY individual person. As basic common sense. Whether you are religious or not. It sincerely ANGERS me, that this is not the case yet. In this world.  On another note, in finally finishing the video they are hilarious as always 😂love you guys. 🙌👑👑
All the team working on the Rhett & Link channel are knocking it out of the park with this year’s reinvigoration. The videos are so much fun to watch, very creatively inspiring and I would imagine an absolute blast to make. I hope there are many more to come. 👏👏👏
Religion has messed these 2 up SO badly...... they have lost all touch with their spiritual side. That eternal energy/light that's in ALL of us & everything. That basic knowing/perception has been warped, and it's a shame. Since religion was always supposed to be just a TOOL for people to get in touch with their natural spirit-self (the self you are when you DREAM for example) & Source/Creator. Yet unfortunately, in this world for many people (like Rhett & Link) it has the opposite effect. Everything religion was SUPPOSED to be in this world, people have warped it or used it for negative agendas. This is why I TRULY believe it's important for everyone to be taught basic spiritual principals 1ST before even jumping into or deciding if they want to be religious. Because these things aren't synonymous & the fact something this basic has to even be explained..... shows how lost, confused & ignorant this world is.   HENCE so many lost/wandering souls after many people pass on. It's sad.
Looking forward to the Spinoff that comes out of this where a group of up and coming UnGhost Hunters go to this house to prove its not haunted and get spooked by the ghosts of Rhett and Link, or maybe the UnGhosts of Rhett and Link?
Biosphere 2 and tribe sweatshirt are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Youtube Gold
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this was GREAT
Well that was unexpected 😂
Two seconds in, hilarious.
We need a “full length” short film with you guys. Docu style is cool but really like to film style.
I was hoping the cat was Jane in the end
Oh DAMN, that ending! Man, you guys have really ramped up with your videos and I can't wait to see more for the Rhett and Link channel! I can't imagine work of this quality is by ANY MEANS quick and easy to do, especially balancing GMM!
I loved when it switched from standard vlog type filming to intense cinematic shots, brilliant 😄❤
The Nartu Forty reference was so nice lol
Jane is nuts...or is she just a conwoman? I'm never certain which is which.
The voicemail tho 😂😂😂
OMG definitely did not expect what would go down in this absolute masterpiece….YOU ARE GENIUSES
It was Chase
You two should book a night at The Real Conjuring House.
Liking and commenting to help you guys get that $1K back 😂 but honestly this is such a funny and original idea, Rhett and Link are great.
The whole video was hilarious and amazing, and the short film at the end was the cherry on top with the color, editing, and cinematography. 11/10 👻
This is the worst title of all time. I would have never clicked if it wasn't you two
What a cinematic masterpiece 👏
You guys just can't miss
Why do I feel like she went in the hot tub for a couple hours then went home
What a masterpiece!
The acting is INCREDIBLE. You can take the kids out of theater but can’t take theater out of the kids
Really well done
this is one of your best. love you both ❤️
dudes just film them self get scammed for USD1K. Mrs Beast got nothing on this duo
LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!
Is the Uncle Iro Funko pop Reht's or Link's?
The most implausible part? Link is bleeding and somehow remains not only conscious, but coherent and able to listen to directions.
Ok this was awesome. Probably my favorite Rhett and link channel video so far!!!
this was absolutely cinematic
This is the best video ever
Well I doubt I'm the only one that now wants to see a whole series of Rhett and Link stay in haunted houses.
I feel like that lady is either completely genuine or a total Bull shitter no in-between
Great story and well produced
you two remind me of the two guys from the insidious series 😂
These new short videos they have been making are amazing! What creative brains they have!
crazy how two og youtube POWERHOUSES can do horror lighting better than some actual horror nowadays !
omg I didn't know sam and dean winchester became youtubers?
love what you guys are doing with this channel. this is one of my favorites so far!!
My only critic : We wanted More, We want more.  My favorite episode after “Digging a Hole” episode.
Okay is that a real game tho?!?
Oh wow, the ending!
You guys need to go ghost hunting with Ryan and Shane.
I think it’s funny how somebody just sold hide and seek
They basically played Phasmophobia in real life
13:56 what even is link
We need more of these. Loved this, you guys have such a dynamic friendship. Keep making entertaining videos and possibly more movies. ❤
“Toner is expensive” so is glossy photo paper 😂
Link reading “meth activity” and looking straight at the camera 😭
the diss they did to people who watch stuff for content haha
That ghost psychic has missed her actual calling as a ttrpg writer.
Top tier vid boys loved it!
I'd love to watch her listen to that voicemail 😂
I like dungeons and dragons too. Fire ball!!😂
I loved all of this!
😂😂 I'm so confused, what is an UNhaunted house?
I wish Rhett and Link would call me, from the hot tub 😉
if the owners of that property think its worth 250 dollars to put the sheets in the washer and load the dishes, i wonder why they dont pay their maids that much.
This was a lot of fun and creepy! Well done!
Incredible vid, fun and innovative content as usual from the guys
Ok so the camera crew had to knew what was going on and didnt tell rhett.. wth 🙄
The cinematography is impressive.
Oh my god this was so scary!! I was viscerally reacting when Link got stabbed. Such good work guys!!
Hahaha… love it.
Guest starring Meowcael Meowyers
All great 👍👍 great shot of Rhett realising it’s not Link. But I wish their „casual” talk continued when they thought they were chased through the house. It started to feel like real movie. I don’t know how to explain it better. 😂 when they were escaping they could have continued with „what the hell was that dude, this supposed to be unhounted house” to give this continous feel that they do commentary not starring in horror movie. But I really loved it regardless, amazing production. hot tub scene, I thought something will happen there that they will hear voices coming from Rhett’s watch 😁
Think they might need some tips from The Ghoul Boys haha
What a masterpiece
This lady can’t be for real 🤣
Link!!! Let the spa (HOT TUB) thing Goooooooooo!😆
This is amazing. The transition from found footage documentary to cinematic horror movie, the $250 charge, great
$9.97 would've already been too much
I can't wait for when they release their movie.
The scariest part of this video is the scammy airbnb host
I thought the mystery killer was going to end up being Stevie.
Man gets stabbed on bed..wait go back and get the sheets to save $250 🤣
What I love about these new videos is that it showcases how much after all this time Rhett and Link are still truest best friends. There’s no question on if they’re playing it up for the camera because their livelihoods are based off of them being best friends. It’s so wholesome :)
They need to an IRL stream.
paying 997 for a scam lol
This video literally got better and better all the way to the end, loved it
I did admittedly try to look up the “mouse in the house” game to find that it didn’t actually exist but now that I’m further into the video I understand why
That was amazing I need more of this!!
I’m laughing so hard at the ghost cleanser 😂this is the funniest video ever
The moment that game showed up I was like there is no damn way that was is the house. They are planning something
Fun fact if someone dies in a home they don’t just mop it up they’ll remove any part of the house that was contaminated so they’ll rip out the floor boards and everything.    Also bonus info for anyone that believes in ghosts/spirits. Spirits just want attention and they don’t want to scared you so if you tell them to “please stop and go away you’re scaring me’ they’ll leave you alone for the time being because like I said their goal is for attention it to scared you. The less attention you give them the more likely they’ll just move along to get attention elsewhere
during no time in this video did I know what was gonna happen, great fucking vid!
guys what the hell that was literally scary
m-m-METH ACTIVITY?
I love how they think so out of the box
Insane to me that Nartu Fawty got a callback, that’s one of my top 10 GMM moments
Omg the voice mail I can’tttttt 😂
Link with the Tribe called quest shirt though
Just my type of dark humor😂😂😂❤❤❤
Jane did not close all four gates. That extermeownator is not of this earth.
The house being at 77 degrees was pretty scary
I cant see sh*t in this mask 😂😊😅
Link hates spending money so much 😂 “You don’t look exhausted, I don’t know how much work ya did”
People who believe in ghosts must be the dumbest people in the whole world.
Loved it!!!
WAIT I'm blown away! Make an actual horror movie please
Dunno what I expected, but it certainly wasn't _that_
Pure gold
They need to go to a REAL haunted house with Ryan & Shane!!
y'all are so silly
Man, you guys come up with the best, craziest stories for your videos. I don't know how you do it but I love it.
I’m glad I watched it through
👏🏻👏🏻😁 After you guys strip the sheets and load the dishwasher you need to make a feature film right away 🎥 🤘🏻
Whose is this jumper Link is wearing???IM IN LOVE
this was so clever, loving these types of videos
I think Link just wanted to go to a Spa 😂.
That $1000 ghost lady is running an amazing scam job
Between being tired and the wide establishing shot, at 12:42 thought Rhett was not wearing pants. 😅
Well done! . Very clever. You should go into horror movies with a twist.....
Best unexpected thriller movie on YouTube. 100/10 would recommend. Looking forward to more! Please 🥺
Ever since the Medium Sized Hole video, whenever I watch a Rhett and Link mockumentary video I always wait with bated breath for the budget to suddenly skyrocket for no reason whatsoever.
Someone need to arrest Jean😭
This is possibly my favorite title for a YouTube video of all time.
Please please please do a collaboration with shane and ryan from watcher on ghost files, watching this video made me realize how much i needed this, amazing video!
Just here to say that watching this while drunk as a skunk was a great idea: the ending absolutely threw me! Also, props to Link for taking a freaking knife for his buddy, I always pictured him as the braver (and dumber, but what is braveness without a hint of stupidty) one of the both of them!
Well that ending was a bummer. RIP😢
This would be scarier if they filmed it on their phones like Blair WITCH project.  The camera man ruins it.😅
Darth Vader hide and seek.
The switch from silly video to horror movie was incredible! Rhett's slow motion head turn when Link called his name gave me serious chills!
Wow wasn't expecting that twist. Hilarious.
I wonder if the property owner is going to reference this video to say that it is a confirmed UN-haunted house
👏👏👏 loved it. please do more
There are no ghosts 😁
Damn imagine paying a rack to still be haunted best believe in smoking that that demon
Well...I did not expect that at all. The was the perfect blend of you guys and creepy funny vibes. I have many emotions but one thing I know is that I need more of UnHaunted.
$1k for that whackadoo woman to play pretend for a few hours is insane.
That was the best Rhett and Link show ever
You shouldn't enable charlatans, let alone pay them extraordinary amounts of money.
ahhhhh, i love these vids😍😍
We Spent The Night In An Unhaunted House needs to be a series!
It went from a Rhett and Link vlog type video to a cinematic quality. That was unreal.
Brilliant
The shot of Rhett hiding behind the curtain was absolutely beautiful 💯❤
Major props to the directors/producers/editors of this video! This was truly shot in an amazing way
Absolutely excellent and hilarious as always!
She just stole the premise of yuyuhakisho lol
I genuinely can not get past Link’s tiny black and white photos
Ghostfacers!!
Plot twist it was Jane the whole time
This was a plot twist I didn’t know I needed. Spooky and funny and somehow wholesome🤍
Okay but the real horror is that thermostat being set at 77 degrees.  No thank you.
The fact that they were willing to spend $1000 to de-ghost the house but not have to pay the $250 while link is bleeding out.
Man and here we all thought they'd be doing the show long into their 70s. Bummer. Maybe Jack Black and Post Malone will pick up GMM and keep it going
I couldn’t tell where the funny comedy shifted into this horror film. I was genuinely scared when I saw Rhett realize the meowinator wasn’t Link. Great job guys!
This is a masterpiece 🙌👏
Damn guys, this was really something. I absolutely love it
Nobody’s talking about the verbal diarrhea they got when having to leave an unexpected voicemail. Ending with an I love you was the perfect ending to that call.
Yeah this was rad
Going from Ghost Files to this is  fabulous 😂😂
The VOICEMAIL 💀💀💀
Anyone else do a search for the "Mouse in the House" game? xD
this is actual fire!!!🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
this waas a movie! 😂
Paying $997 to a fraud. Nice.
I'd hang out with Jan. She was cool
You guys should do more of this. Seriously.
Absolutely brilliant.
That was amazing!
I wanna know what genius came up with that Mouse in the House game.  Could you imagine if that was real? You just charging people to play hide-and-go-seek 😂😂  "Would you like to play my new game, You Can't Catch Me I'm the Gingerbreadman? One person is the baker and wears a chef's hat. Everyone else is a Gingerbreadman who doesn't wear a hat. Then the baker has to catch one of them and when they do, they become the baker!" "So tag?" "Na, this is totally different. And only costs 99.99!" "For a hat?"
gotta love the anamorphic lens use
I know this is supposed to be entertaining but I just can’t get over the fact you paid $1,000 to have some crazy lady do finger guns in a random house you don’t own.
Please tell me this story continues. I was dying laughing when it cut to black. And also thoroughly entertained when it switched from vlog to spooky.
Ending is better made then most horror films loved this episode
Should have asked Sue the Ghost Realtor for some advice
This gaves me an idea, what shane and ryan did a cross over with Rhett and link?
these damn videos are genius. Just when you think they are done it takes an incredible turn.
I can’t wait for the Reddit threads asking “did that really happen to Rhett & Link?” and “Are R&L okay? They’re not dead right?!” 😂😂  But from someone who actually has a brain, well done lads!! 👏👏
I honestly can't believe you guys didn't get out of there after you heard "herbal herbal"
The second half though! Awesome.
The production value is amazing!
Okay I haven't watched the episode yet, but I sleep in the room someone died in in my house. It was my great-grandma's husband. Never seen a ghost. But considering how many people there are everywhere, you gotta assume that no matter where you are, someone died there at some point in history.
I love this whole video, gave similar vibes to Rhett And Links Night of Terror video. I hope to see more short horror films from this channel!
I hope you guys never stop making these great videos on this channel. I love these so much even if they aren’t as business effective as GMM stuff, love the content guys! ❤
Yall need to make a horror movie now
this was awesome! the ending was my favorite part!!!
I can’t stop laughing, this along with all their content is what I look forward to every morning!
Link’s A Tribe Called Quest shirt is my favorite thing ever
Their search for the perfect undaunted house was super similar to my actual search for a house this year 😄
The new Rhett&Link vids make me question every vlog now if it’s all planned… I do like it tho
this is actually TERRIFYINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Love it
The ending was actually terrifying it really drew me in I think Rhett and Link should actually create a full length horror movie they should make a 3-hour horror movie
$997 to practice GeoGuessr and hadouken some ghosts for 3 hours?  I’ve found my new career.
if i could like this twice i would
My favorite video from their latest collections was the haunted vinyl record.
"Whoa, how do ghosts feel about meth?"
I was hoping the killer would whisper “Hi Daddies” and be cotton candy randy.
Rhett I want you
Not Rhett being so rich he lives in the same neighborhood where the Menendez brothers lived (Beverly Hills)  😮
1000 dollars to make up a little story for your clients for a couple minutes is some of the best well payed grifts I have seen.
That went 0-100... real quick. Bravo.
I am speechless. This was AMAZING!
The ending!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏 funny, creepy, AND ties everything all in at the end. A+ writing and concept!!!!
The look on Rhett's face when Link yelled "hey Rhett."  Is there going to be a part 2?  I want to know what happens!!  LOL.
this was the best thing ive ever seen
phasmaphobia irl
Rhett's absolute, cinematic hair toss when he heard Link's voice was nothing short of magnificent! I was cackling the entire time 'cause that whole last sequence was so unexpected, but so, so awesome. They really pull of horror well and I love seeing them dip their toes into it! :D
The scariest part was the AC being set to 77
I'm very offended that they forgot the name of that ghost hunter whose name I also forgot. He's one of my favorite bits of mythical lore!
I was immersed with the performance you guys put on! Loved the style.
This is so cool !!!
INCREDIBLE! Bravo, I don’t wanna sound greedy but we want more of this video style! 😂❤
I came in thinking this would be like a gmm on the road boy did that go differently. What a great short movie. Legit editing great job team.
Top tier guys! Donny darko vibes and I loved it
I LOVE THIS!
I grew up in the neighboring community to the real EXORCIST house in St Louis.   I must have walked past it a dozen times and never even knew it.
Amazing work again by Rhett and Link and mythical crew! Love how it started out as a silly YouTube vlog but the tone shifted seamlessly into a horrifying short film. Can't wait till next video!
I LOVE when Rhett and Link videos like this get posted. I wait until myself and my friends are together to watch it. Your videos never disappoint, guys. Even after all these years ❤  Although I might have nightmares about that cat mask tonight....
i'm more afraid of link than a ghost.
Jane has voting rights…let that sink in.
What the crap! Well done. Seriously well done. You guys and the team just keep getting better and better. This one and the nap one are high on my list of having to share and rewatch.
please make a horror movie yall 😔🙏🏼
This was a masterpiece. I was so invested. Great job guys. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You have no idea how long I’ve waited for someone to do this. This is awesome
Omg. You guys are the best.
Now do a haunted one
I'm thinking it was Stewart in the second mask, and he's the one updating the house listing at the end. That would explain why he didn't want them to open the door upstairs, that's where he was hiding waiting to strike 😱
That voicemail killed me
Loved every second of this!
Caught me off guard 😂
Love it! definitely re-watching this one!
Yoo this little short film at the end is amazing
I’m gonna keep saying this but it’s insane the effort they put into this show it’s got tv show quality production
$1000 for that lmao
I love how they make scary things still funny sometimes
And the most terrifying part: this is literally how Rhett and Link would die at rhe hands of a serial killer.😂😮
So your telling me I can hire myself a looney toon for 997? I'm sold!
Link having a shoulder tatt is actually quite surprising
Y’all could make a cheesy “scary movie” And people would pay to watch it. Meaning me (at least), I would pay to see it.
I sometimes forget that they have professional cinematographers on their team
It was Jane!
That was incredible!
Please do more. I love this. We’ve been needing this, life complete
Link's shirt game though
love it! I keep thinking these cannot get any better and then they do. perfect mix of everything fun, goofy, scary and MYTHICAL
As a horror fan, this was AWESOME. Amazing work guys
the wildest intro to a horror short i've ever seen, lol
They need to make more unhaunted
they just keep getting better! I love it. They are cinematic gods!!! ❤
i did not expect that 😭😭😭
This. Was. Amazing. Had to rewatch a couple of times. Y'all are legends.
I would definitely pay money to see Rhett and Link do a real, proper ghost hunting show. With both their talents combined, it would be super entertaining
Link's face at 10:28 seems so real 😂he was not playing up anything there lol
I am loving the content on this channel! This was an amazing and unexpected skit. You think you know how the story will go, but nooooope!
I love when you do scary short videos!! I would love to see a full length horror movie with you guys in it!!
Beautiful creation
Got the notification, almost pooped myself cause I'd love to see them in a haunted house fr
i would love to see rhett and link do a video with sam and colby
This was amazing 😂 I hope they make a movie one day 🍿👀
That A Tribe Called Quest Sweater is sick.
😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
The end just kept getting better and better, we need more!
Fantastic!!
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE GENIUS AND CINEMATIC HIDE AND SEEK SKIT
its 11pm and im trying so hard not to wake my family from hysterical laughter when they recorded the voicemail (18:32)
I would watch a series of thrillers with you guys
Mehhh... 🙄
I really enjoy this era of YouTube
Nathan fielder set up unhaunted realestate
I told my mom about the died in house website and she yelled "DON'T YOU DARE LOOK UP OUR HOUSE!!" 😂
I think there was a ""mad dog lukus ' in the cat mask...
I have too say.. it is a real dumb idea for a movie.. but I liked it for some reason 😂,👍✌️
Something tells me that the "Ghost psychic" scammed them
I LOVE these Rhett and Link videos!! They are so creative and fun to watch. I hope you keep making them! I think they may be my favorite thing you produce at Mythical.
rewatching knowing how it ends 😮
It seems such a Link thing not to splurge for color toner.
Halloween 2024: KallMeKris visits the house with her ghost communicator and asks,  “Link, what are you doing?”  (beep) “Spreading.”  She then asks Rhett where he is. (beep) “Middle.”
yoooo that ending! so cool
No way they discovered the Urameshi spirit gun
Uncle Iroh Funko!
this is amazing
They did a colab with shane and ryan of the watchers before.. they shouldve went ghost hunting with them.. that wouldve been epic!! 😁😁😁
A self check out portal. I died.
Brilliant!
😂😂😂😂😂 that game was actually spooky! Great video❤
This was awesome 👏
This was a freaking awesome video!!!
These are great.  997 for the cleansing that shot fire balls, plus the sub for the website but didn't want to front the 250 for dishes and sheets.
Y’all have to get on Puppet history as well as the the ghost adventures with Ryan and Shane!
I am begging you to collaborate with Shane and Ryan of watcher
This made me realize that i need to see a horror comedy with rhett and link as the leads
0:23 Stevie
wow, this was a great video!
Jane trying to get a hot tub peek lol
These videos they've been making lately that blur the line between what seem like more candid "vlogging" and scripted wackiness have been great! Regardless of whether it's entirely planned in advance or not or if it all just unfolds like a fantastic game of improv between them as they figure out what they're doing as they go, I don't care. It's just a delight seeing something that plays with the illusion of reality that dips into the wonderful and surreal. I love it. (It kinda reminds me of Regular Show in that way. 😆)
Would be very excited to see short or even feature length films with rhett and link when cat and mouse started i felt like i was on netflix. Cinematography and acting was fantastic 👏 👌
I AM SPOOKED
ok but THIS was the video perfect to collab with Shane and Ryan
This was UNREAL - i love this format of a short film popping up out of a light hearted rhett and link vlog
WOW WHAT
Yes amazing yes.
Best one yet 😙🤌
That thermostat said it was 77 inside yall. Pretty toasty
Forget the Extermeownator. A thermostat set to 77 is my nightmare.
“We wanted to get paid for having a spa day and staying in an AirBnb”
This house reminds me of the house they were in in their horror movie from a few years ago. I loved that short film. They should do more.
I bet ghost lady is the kitty cat kiiler 😂
I wanna cry 😭. Wasn’t expecting legit scary with the boys in peril. Blood and everything. Did Rhett at least put his shoes back on?
I’m definitely in the wrong line of work. How does one become a “ghost psychic”? 😂
Geeking out over Rhett wearing a Biosphere 2 shirt! It’s in my hometown and my whole family has worked there at some point 💜
28 ghosts and 4 portals to hell now give me $1000 dollars lmao. Psychics are such con artists. Great video.
Give our best to your staff 😂😂😂😂😂 I can’t stop laughing 😂😂
It was definitely Jane right
fuckin phenomenal lads
yall paid $48 for the website ???
I for sure thought Jane was going to be the second mouse after they invited her over to the house
If Rhett & Link stopped doing GMM and only made these videos I would not be upset at all. I love the way they can make any topic entertaining ... even the ones that sound really dumb on paper.
The whole time they're on with the ghost cleaning service 😂😂  It has Christopher Guest vibes all the way through and I'm here for it
Bravo, guys.
Love this!  Thank you.
im loving these vids man!!!
I will end up watching this video 200 times just like the others 😂 keep up the great content!
That's insane, I love it
This was funny as hell! Rhett's panic waiting for link to find him😂
Loved every minute of this.👏
This is why I would never stay at Abnb,  why do I need to do chores
14:28 lmao I love them
OMG y'all!!! Another hit on the Rhett and Link channel! Been loving what y'all have been creating over here and AGAIN I was left with my jaw DROPPED by the end!
Yo spiritual or not you don’t play around with this type of stuff lol GREAT ending!
I forgot I was watching Rhett & Link lol
Yes!! A new episode of Ghost Files!!!…wait a minute, this isn’t Ryan and Shane
the cinematography and acting at the end was so unexpectedly intense and professional! your vlog just get better and better. i love it!
Amazing! Loved every bit of this! Well done!
Paying this woman $1000 for that garbage should be considered a  "gifticality"
Does anyone know if that crazy lady is an actor or if they really payed her 1,000 😭😭😭
Is it just me or does Rhett look different in this video
the timing of this dropping the day after Ryan & Shane investigated a modern house is immaculate
amazing
I miss when they used to make a bunch of fun music videos on this channel.
well done, gentlemen.
Didnt know link was a fan of A Tribe Called Quest
Can’t believe this 6 minute video was 30 minutes long
IM SO SCEEEEEEEEEEEERED!!!!!!!
That was amazing. Hopefully these will get the traction they deserve
This is by far the best thing the guys have ever made.
LINK GOT SHANKED 😂 NOOOO
Amazing! Well shot, written, lighted, and executed! In my opinion, I believe that the scene where Rhett initially sees the knife of the attacker could have been amplified if the knife became in focus for a split second before returning to the solo shot of Rhett. I’m no expert and it’s only my opinion.  Absolutely loved it, huge fan and eager to see what you guys come up with next, as always! ❤
I want more!! 😂
Only in f-ing California
That slow mo turn of Rhett when link called out was intense the realization in his face
Gosh these two are aging like fine wines
Hot Damn Boys! That was a good one!!
🫣🫨🫨 soo good!
This went from just being Rhett & Link being Rhett & Link to a cinematic horror masterpiece lol
The way I would watch a 10 season show of exactly this
Ok but can we discuss the thermostat being set to 77?! That could kill me alone.
Gold
That phone call in the hot tub was hysterical.
The "hey rhett" then flashlight up to the mask was cinema gold honestly. Silly creative chaps create beauty when they really want to
The real horror was the thermostat at 77 degrees!
This is amazing
This is one of the best YouTube videos of all time.
honestly y'all should direct a horror short! this was actually a blast to watch
This literally had me so hooked guys best work so far
lol what
You guys so comedy well! You do horror even better!  Macon brothers now this. Love it!
Okay I should've known! 😂👏👏👏
omg so funny, well done - the blair witch hand held cam was totally perfect!!
The videos on this channel lately have been my absolute favorite
i was actually so on edge at the end, the quality of this video is so good
Link, where did you get the low end theory sweatshirt
the production of this is insane!! love what you guys are doing lately, keep up the work :)
Great stuff! Keep it up 😁
Lmfao he really forgot he was wearing the watch😂😂
I can’t believe Nartu Foty was 2014… im so old… 😢
I’m just here to say Rhett and link deserve every damn penny they’ve made. They are flipping amazing artists and incredible business men. You go guys 🤯🥰
Excellent!
You guys nail the halloween content every year. I loved this!
That WALLPAPER is to die for!  I'd love to know the name of that gorgeous green wallpaper. Anyone?
This was incredible and so unexpected
When Rhett cusses it's almost like hearing your grandmother cuss or a small child, you just don't expect it.
whut she can cast fireball thats insane
Off topic but link on that tribe crewneck is everything I needed to see and I love it
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is soo much I could list about what I loved but I am going to high light the Uncle Iroh figure on the desk!
Liked this a lot!
I was not expecting that absolute masterpiece at the end. Much better than the majority of feature length movies nowadays. Crazy. 😮
Terrifying! 😂 This is excellent, 10/10 recommend
"that would be a horrible show"  ... "....isnt that what this video is though? " lmao lol .
PPEASE MAKE A MOVIE IDC WHAT GENRE YALL KNOW HOW TO DO IT
I thought I was watching a funny video until I got totally spooked 😩
That was legit scary! Well done, boys.
Normal Investigations the tv series...
The EMF detectors are useless in the presence of devices that emit EMFs...
LOVED THE ENDING so funny. Bravo
Praying to work for their future production company cause wow that was fantastic
So I need a Rhett & Link and Sam & Colby collab. I need this energy in some of those ghost hunts 😂
I wonder if she uses both hands to throw those fireballs like on Street Fighter...
oh, mythical can do cinnematic😮
This was amazing lol
😮😢🥶🥵😭
I could of done with another 10 mins of the scary stuff after the tonal shift but this was still fantastic! With this and Hazel, Rhett and Link (and team)  clearly have a  real talent for this kind of comedy/horror genre!
This was AWESOME
Shouldn't everywhere be haunted?
What a rollercoaster of emotions. I LOVED it! More please 😂
I nearly peed myself from the jump scare toward the end. 77 degrees in the house is way too hot
Wow!! This is such a well done piece!!! You guys! 🎉👏👏👏
RIP
Top tier content, make more of this!!! PLS
loading the dishwasher would be wayyyy easier to do with a stab wound
🎉🫰🫰🫰
THIS IS AWESOME
This! This is the type of content that shows how talented you two are! Great video!
I knew they would throw in a jump scare or something.  I did not know how dark it would actually get. 😂BRAVO
Cape cod style???
I love this so much. Please keep making videos like this. They have all been such a treat!!
A lot of spirits come from the land that was inhabited  many years ago. i have seen a ghost when i worked in a pub. My grand daughter and i see black shadow  shapes too.
Is this the end!
rhett and link need to make like a fully produced slasher but not at all market it as a horror movie but rather like a classic rhett and link comedy and like 30 minutes in all hell breaks loose and rhett, link, and the whole mythical crew are in a terrifying slasher
You guys need to make an actual scary movie! I would watch it on repeat every day!
You guys really Shama-laama ding dong'ed it
what i’ve learned about these rhett & link channel videos is, that everything about them is scripted. even the things that you don’t think are scripted, are scripted. sure there’s some improv in between, but overall it’s scripted.
They did all this just to have a cool short horror  movie LMAO XDD
You know… someone can just copy the link to find the info that you’re blurring out essentially doxxing yourself.
A grand for a crazy person I would of done the same for 500 😂 maybe go to an actual "haunted" series I bet you would get a lot of views
It was so cool to see the boys leave their first voicemail.
Amazing as always! The content on this channel is so different and refreshing!
They gotta do a collab with Sam and Colby!!!!!!!
So great
Once again the Rhett and Link channel top their last video, this is genuinely a great short film.
This was the exact content I didn't know I needed. Perfection!
“Did you send them to a convenience store” 😂
this would have made a great feature length movie!
Herbal herbal 😂
Well done! I didnt want it to end! 👏👏🔪💀
It's a real shame these videos (which are so well-produced and edited) don't get as many views as the average GMM episode.  This one was so good and my favorite of R&L's long-form videos they've released since resurrecting their channel (again).
Wait wait wait no comments I've seen are asking if there will be a part two?? It feels like there is going part 2, I hope so
That ending was so cinematic and cool, I love this so much
Another banger, love the content coming out of this channel
Guys!  Gotta say that I enjoy the stuff on this channel a lot more than Good Mythical Morning.  This was hilarious!  Please keep it up!
I would totally watch content like this from you guys every day and never miss it. This is excellent.
Rhett is wearing a Biosphere 2 shirt in their planning meeting! That’s the scariest unhaunted house/science project in Tucson, Arizona; neigh, the world.
Locked doors? Clogged toilets? Did you at least check the games for a ouija board? All the signs were there guys!!!
more content that look liken short movies please, this was amazing.
How have I never seen this channel.. ever 😂 I’m dying
great video!
Y'all just make a legit movie already..  these videos are literally too good for youtube
Canadian Ryan & Shane
there were 29 ghost type pokémon at the house
😂 I loved this
I....was not expecting that short movie ending... why was it so well done?? lol
Jane is definitely in on it!
This was great!!! We need more short movies
bro these videos on this channel are GOLD 😂😂😂 please keep them coming!!!
"Toner is expensive". Yes. I've had it with my printer. I don't want to deal with it right now.
Okay...guys...my fellow Mythical Beasts...Our boys need to be the lead roles in a horror film STAT.
this is one horror film for the ages
Rhett and Link talking about how great the list of rules for the house is  Me: Hearing not to attempt to open the locked doors "what is in those locked doors?" "why are they locked?" "are they hiding bodies?" "must be investigated"
Did not expect it to turn into a full blown movie at the end 😂 Big props to the editing and filming crews y’all did a hell of a job! This makes me ever more excited for some day if y’all ever get the cards lined up to do a mythical movie 🙌
We need a rhett and link scary movie ASAP... whoever is writing these amazing job better than most movies these days ❤
I love how the cinematography changed when the lights went out. It looked so good in 4K!
It’s so sad to see them go. I don’t know how I or the world will go on without you guys. Gone are the day where I would listen to Ear Biscuits to get a laugh while doing homework. GMM will not be the same and neither will I. You guys will be missed.❤😢
They are fantastic! Loved this.
"love you" "'Love you'?" "I don't know man, I panicked." 😂😂
omg i’m literally shaking in my boots
That room where they were researching looks so cool. Love the vibe
Rhett & Link directed horror movie when?? C'mon Hollywood!
This has been the funniest video on this channel in a long time 😂 brilliant
The irony of Link being the one who got stabbed when he's the one who faints at the sight of blood
I NEED to know what type of cameras their production team are using!!!
Nah this has to be a joke
I love these videos so much oh my goodness
Loved it!!
I would do anything for a feature length horror film by ya'll
"Give love to your staff, Jesus and Mary." 😂
Jeez.. what a terrifying, terrifying fee..
"I HAVE EXORCISED THE DEMONS... This house is clear"
bro i get so excited when they post on this channel. I love these vidssss
Real Ones know that this channel is where the best R&L content is. Excellent video, yet again, guys. You just did in a half hour what Blumhouse movies usually take three times as long to do.
This is was awesome!!!
Link inviting Jane into the hot tub is hilarious. And Rhett telling her he loved her killed me
Well that took a turn.
These videos are some of my most favorite videos on YouTube 🤣
Another great video from this channel!
is that chase? sounded like chase breathing...
omg i loved this!!! AH i would love to see a longer version of the skit or just a different skit altogether. i love rhett/links skits!! It would also be so fun to see rhett/link go into an actual haunted place with another youtuber who does that stuff like spookyboo or something!
The production was awesome!
They always have the best, most original ideas and the ending was so good! lol
That lady has ice kings eyes
The voicemail was incredible 😂
Please team up with Watcher. It's what the world needs
This lady is a wack! And i believe in all this but she... is a wack
Probably my favorite one of these projects so far!
Dang that was the longest voicemail I've ever heard
Man, who's gonna host GMM now??!!?!
Welp, that house is haunted NOW.  (I cackled a bit too loudly throughout this video. Well done!)
Do we have to wait until Monday to know if they are alright?!
I don't think you could pay Link any amount of money to go into a actual haunted house.
I got so excited about DiedInHouse, went to it expecting it to be a joke. It is real, but they charge a fee... bummer  Edit: anyone who unironically believes in what this crazy-ass woman is saying deserves to be separated from their $1k, good lord that was hard to sit through, my eyes rolled out of my head onto the floor when she slid the bomb cover over the energy "in her mind," gtfoh 😂
Dope
Guys. Y’all are KILLING IT with these videos! So damn good 🙌🏻
You guys are truly geniuses! 🤯☠️😺
Alternate Title: The Extermeownator by Rhett and Link
Actually had my stomach drop when Rhett understood after Link caled out.👏🏻
26:34 CHILLS
Loved it! So happy they are making content on this channel again as well
I love this new genre that Rhett and Link have created where impromptu comedy gradually turns into scripted short film and you never quite know where the separation is. Additional thought: it cracks me up that Link would go back into a killer's lair after being stabbed to clean in order to avoid paying 250 bucks when he's just shelled out almost 1k for a psychic to un-haunt the house... That's just the perfect touch of absurdity and Link's personality-based humor that keeps my funny bone tickled long after I've watched it.
So the Easter Egg...of the AirBnB owners watching their hidden security footage...and then erasing Link and Rhett's names off of their Gimp 2 Do Board....Classic
dammit guys, the switch to anamorphic at the end was genius👌🏻
One of the best on this channel so far, keep it uppp! Thanks guys!
the countdown of turning into the hairless cat killed me
The ranch house has an upstairs?    I'm out
I want that unhaunted orange leather couch. That was a pretty nice house even though it didn't have any goats.
"Two guys in hot tub..." Anyone else? 😂
More like Michael Meowers
Plot twist, the other cat person was Jane
You’re not Ryan and Shane you’re two washed up old men who sold their soul
I love the pivot back to humour at the end “we gotta strip the sheets and load the dishwasher”
Approve
This was brilliant.
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I need a full length movie next!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"self checkout" 🤣 just love the production quality on these - amazing!  👏👏👏
that ending was AMAZING
Watching them leave a voicemail was the cutest thing 😂 “Love you?” “I don’t know man, I got nervous” 😂
Great work on this.  Reminded me a little of the haunted vinyl tiktok video from a few years ago 😁🤙
Ryan and Shane from Watcher should've joined this one 🤣 I love when your channels collab. That's how I found your page!! 🤗
i love how cinematic these videos are
Rip😢
That was a journey!  I love this kind of video, especially when it is kinda scary or goofy.  Well played gentelmen, well played!
I usually don't care for ghost horror but this was so fresh and atmospheric I absolutely loved it!! I hope y'all continue to do these comedy/horror videos because I rarely see creators who can blend those two genres like you two. Multi-talented kings!!!
Links right. Toner IS expensive 😂
Omg I loved this 😂😂
i love how her fire balls are just straight up hellish rebukes
love it !
I love how this started from something like a funny vlog to a cinematic masterpiece
I love this channel so much
Link "Toner is expensive" pays $1000 on a ghost remote remover 🤭
I'm in the wrong line of work LOL! Jane has hit the Jackpot LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Head cannon is that the woman is the killer. Like the whole thing is a set up to get their location and "free their spirits." That's why she didn't answer the phone. 👻
They paid for each of those searches!?
Daaamnnn that ending was so sick haha
That hot tub phone call was fricken hysterical. 😅😅😅😅😅 this video is genius
Watchin with my pup and she falls asleep at the best of the best (cuz its all the best) part 😅😂 Fun Fact :: I posted this comment on a COMPLETELY different channel, thus video 😂😂 That's what I get for watching on TV and using my phone for comments 😂
i was so excited to watch this when you guys teased it on GMM! the concept seemed so funny. you guys know how to put us in the spooky spirit. the ending reminded me of your guys' horror project, Hazel. now i need to go rewatch that!
This is honestly one of the best R&L videos om the channel! I don't usually watch this channel, just gmm, but omg this was fantastic!
The voicemail they left the Ghost Lady while in the hot tub made me cry laughing 😂😂😂😂
77° on the thermostat?!
“It has a spa in it”  *Rhetts silent, unmoving reaction*  😂😂
This was very well done! Great job Rhett and Link.
The shark.... has been jumped... 🤣
The way it just seamlessly transitioned was chefs kiss! I won’t lie, I was kinda on edge and had to stop the video twice lol amazing work you guys!
Epic!
You guys gotta do this with shane and ryan from watcher
Whoever edited the mouse in the house bit, you deserve a raise
The shift from the usual parody style video to an truly terrifying movie sequence was incredible. The odd comment from the homeowner about the locked doors upstairs really added to the intrigue later in the scene! Fantastic work!
This is awesome guys!!!
Brava 👏 well done
nothing says Air BNB like a busted fire pit & a game cabinet with one weird game in it 😂😂😂
You guys never let me down! I love it!
Links the low end theory Long sleeve is fire
y'all, this was AMAZING content!!! I had so many different feelings through this whole thing.  I actually was nervous, and was NOT expecting it to change energy like that. BRAVO. This is so good.
That creepy lady was in on it!!
Rhett and Link have done it again...fantastic job you guys xD
Absolutely loved it, I think we're all now expecting the Rhett & link full fledged horror film
this is one of my favorite videos from this channel now!
SO GREAT - my favorite so far. Loved the change to horror film - it was done so excellently.
I miss u guys this is a brilliant idea. FUNNY!!😂
okay👀👀but the end, and how it all came together???👏👏👏❤😍😍😍 LOOOOVEDD ITTT
Not Got’eem! 🤣 26:17
I love how it's literally just hide & seek in a box
This was an amazing video!  Perfect Halloween vibes while also being fun. Hope to see more of these :)
Think Jane the ghostbuster and her crazy cost for spewing woo is the scariest part. 🤣
How DO ghosts feel about meth?
Pleased to meet you💞🎉😍
You have no idea how much I wanted Cotton Candy Randy to be behind the cat mask.
Jane…. Doing nothing for 997….😂😂 get me in on that business
LOVED THIS GUYS!!!
I prefer the term "De-haunted" myself...
Pretty fantastic guys
$1000 for pretty much a scam
Welll... that took a turn!! Loved it !
this type of content gives me the goofy video i want but with that well produced ending to it, these new videos have been great I'm glad the two of them are having fun and not eating food
This was so well made. Thankyou for posting this Rhett and Link. May the Holy Trinity Bless you you Rhett and Link and may the Holy Trinity Bless everything. It is up to the Lord Amen.
i think im in litteral pain from watching the part of that ghost lady who is friends with all the angels... Im fighting for my life to not skip that part 😮‍💨
Link is the king of comfort. In bed before 9 pm, takes naps at work, *must* have a spa in the house, and I bet he sleeps with one of those eye masks to reduce eye strain because he's all about it.
I did not expect that ending omg this was great!! I actually felt like I was watching a movie it looked really well done😊
Brilliant. I loved it.
YOU GUYS THIS WAS INCREDIBLE
Ok. I’m sorry but they got scammed out of almost a thousand dollars. Even if ghosts are real she did not and could not do anything to get rid of them.
Need ghost files and rhett and link to collab 😂
This was a weird ad...
11:00 "I have to fireball 'em" 🤣😂Wow. And there are people out there that actually buy what this lady is selling.
At the beginning, I heard the house rule of "don't try to open the locked room" and thought "damn this AirBnB is legit creepy" and then realized at the end what was up
I had to rewind and just listen to the voicemail segment as if I was receiving it as Jane and… 😂😂😂😂 I would save that voicemail forever
This is a masterpiece!!! I cannot believe how great this turned out. Went from a goofy YouTube video, to a full blown Netflix horror movie in a second!
that voicemail was so chaotic and im here for it all
Well, that took a turn.  😄
is there still a $250 fee if you bleed on the sheets and do you have to pay from the spirit realm?
i always thought an unhaunted house stay would be such a great idea lol this was so freakin fun perfect for halloween this channel genuinely is a gem
This channel comeback was the best thing you guys ever did
AMA! How have y’all been friends for so long without hating each other. Cause that seems to happen at some point during a friendship.
OMG! This was awesome. I can’t wait for more vids. Loved 🥰 it.
14:46 Link looking like he's never seen a flashlight before 😂😂😂
I was hoping the other extermeownator would be the psychic
Love the whole concept! It left we wanting more 🙌 good job!
This needed to be longer. I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!! I'm loving this channel so much.
Amazing project!
You guys should have stayed the night in a haunted house and film activity, then after, have Jane clear the house without having her know that you already filmed activity and then stay the night again to see if any activity happens
Each one of these R&L productions has been somehow more incredible than the last.
For me the scariest part was the thermostat being set to 77…
As ghosts they should hire her again to sabatoge the killers plans.
Wish i could give this 100 stars!!!  Great job everyone!!
I was fully expecting the mask to come off and it's Chase
Terrifying!   $1000? I’ve got chills.
that lady is laughing all the way to the bank.
The real question is where can I buy the game Mouse In The House??!?!
Love them but I feel like they are making fun of Sam and Colby no hate
Haunted house or Queer D ‘n B?
Bros got scammed 😂
This is the content I’m here for
Really enjoying u guys pushing your creativity!
i think when link was searching for houses he put "spa" as a filter
This is my favourite of the "New Era" R&L channel videos so far
Imagine the owners of the home have cameras installed - Seeing two dudes ratting it up in their house. LMAO
I can’t believe people like that exist. Are they just lying to everyone or just delusional? Or both?
I am waiting for yall to make a movie that everyone thinks is going to be a comedy but it turns in to the best horror film of the year. Great job again!
I can't explain how great this is
That was the most chaotic voicemail ever 🤣
i adore this channel
I tried that died in house site with two of my relatives and they didn’t have anything. Im guessing if it didn’t make the news they don’t know. Kind of a rip off.
...can we talk about how Link did NOT hesitate in saving Rhett!??  ....Boy came in that room (in the dark, no less), like a BEAST! (26:57) ...we knew he was a spitfire, but...WHEW......😍 ....
238 within 3 miles is basically all your neighbors! Lol
I love it!  This is great!!
I was so (pleasently) startled  when this started becoming a legit hollywood style film
I think it was a great idea with these to not make it clear what is scripted and what isn't. Keeps the audience on their yoes.
1k to imagine something is awesome. I want that job
The voicemail has me literally dead 😂
The EMF reader going off in front of Rhett’s Lock Screen of Jesse was so funny to me for some reason
Sp00ky
can’t believe they’re gone 😔
I thought they went with the Ranch Style? Aren't all Ranch Style houses all single floor?
Did You Know This Video Is Based On Hotel Trasylvania?
I love how they just let their creativity run wild with these videos. Anything goes, I love it!
when sniperwolf doxes your rental house.
Rhett and Link never fail to deliver
Anyone else notice the thermostat set to 77? That's way too warm! Btw, we love Rhett and Link without Stevie.
Absolutely brilliant!!!!!!! ❤
AMAZING!! WOW WOW WOW WOW!! 👏👏👏
The fact that this whole ending was just fabricated simply because they found this  weird ass game in the game cabinet..
That chick is full of shid 😂
This made my whole month😭😂🤍 I love Rhett and link
A channel i never new existed thx guys now i do your first episod came out 17 yesrs ago i was 21 then and dident even know about gmm and first now i found this channel :)
“If you have Jesus do you really need his mom too?” 😂
Plot Twist: Home owner came back early after he heard someone unhaunted his haunted house..
Elevators scream haunted IMO 😂
Awesome. This was a great video. I was hoping for something like this as a follow up to Hazel.
I would love to see more videos like this wildly entertaining
The real horror was the thermostat set to 77 degrees lol
I may not watch gmm as much as before but let me tell you how excited I get for these Rhett&Link channel videos
“Damn, Jane GHOSTED us” was a great unexpected moment. Link and his dad humor never fails.
She picked that ranch home because she wanted to stay there while she cleared it of discarneasada'd entities.
The hot tub scene. No words.
For anyone interested Jane's services are real. I had to Google the service to see if it was scripted. She's not an actress 😂
My favorite so far!
This was great.  Really really really great.  I didn't see anything coming.
I love that they commit to the dad grunting even when acting
Easiest 1000$ I’ve ever seen- even Mr. Beast has more of a challenge for people!
I love that they pay and are super serious when it comes to getting help for weird stuff no one else would believe.
broooooo this is awesome
Fantastic video!!!!
This was genuinely so well done wow I loved it!
Link knowing Nartu Fodie off the top of his head is great
No way Link would hesitate in the moment for real. He'd bull rush right in and not stop at all yelling WHAT WERE YOU THINKING🎉
This was so good. Excellent job! Actually surprised Rehtt said the f word! Thank you for the great video!
The scariest part was the thermostat set to 77 IN LA 😅😅😳😳
Would honestly love to see these guys do a ghost hunt with Ryan and Shane sometime
Any guessing on who played the killer mouse? My money is on David Hill.... Just the way he got up off the bed felt David Hill-ish... lol
Great production!!! 💫
I LOVE these kinds of videos! very well thought out and nicely put together
The ghost lady is clearly schizophrenic.
more like a documentary on uncovering a con artist
THIS WAS AMAZNG!! Did not expect that short film at the end. Beautifully filmed, and fantastic acting!! This says a lot about Rhett & Link, that after all these years, they keep upping their game so to speak, and make really unique stuff that we haven't really seen anywhere else on the internet.  So dope!
LOVED EVERY “BIT” of it 😂😂
I'd be interested to see a comparison. 29 ghosts and 4 underworld portals sounds like a lot, but how many are in the average home, or the house they were in for the conference call?
this is a masterpiece
whatdafuckjushappen
MORE OF THIS PLEASE
They could literally make a movie like full on...
Wooooow! Amazing video/short movie! :D
New Life goal get paid $1,000 to mine blast a bunch of ghosts
Every time they post a vid on this channel, it’s so great. Like so incredibly great. So grateful for them and all of their content
The whole angels and after life thing was a waste of 1k I can't believe that
So it was definitely Lucas in the second extermeownator suit, right?  Lucas is kinda scary all on his own.
Holy cow! Y'all are so creative!
This is amazing! I absolutely LOVE these videos, amazing! I really hope you can earn back those $997 with this video lmao
The Rhett and Link's pandemic Night of Horror, but from a different dimension.  Also, why separate beds? No! One bed, King size, 2 bros, CUDDLING!
Every single time, without fail, if Link gets a flashlight it WILL be pointed in Rhett’s eyes.
i cannot stress how much i have loved the recent videos on this channel
most couples: "we took a 2 day vacation to this nice resort"   Rhett and Link: "We Spent The Night In An UnHaunted House"
28:52  That was absolutely amazing every time these dudes are together and make something I'm more than happy to be there for it for so many years at least a decade these dudes have been such a great part of everyone's life we should be so thankful very awesome
If I charged people one thousand dollars at a time to clear ghosts from their houses, could I look myself in the mirror and live with myself?   Could YOU? 🫵
I am absolutely loving this whole high production value, chaotic, semi-scripted series of Rhett and Link exploring society through their own creativity. I know they're aiming to appear to a broader audience and I really think they're hitting their marks every time, and everyone who already knows Rhett and Link can delight in their what I can only call youthful whimsy.   And I know it's rather off-brand, but I would absolutely watch "Rhett and Link Visit 228 Offenders". Maybe a Mythical Society exclusive??
OKAY ACTORZZZZZ slayed
"Stop firing radio at the plant.. youre gonna kill it" another good link quote
🎉
Please, please make a horror movie! From a horror genre loving fan, to Rhett & Link, you killed that little bit at the end! I love it! Thank you so much.
She's clearly a scammer
Everyone knows Link would of passed out if he seen his own blood, lol. Rhett would had to of carried him out!😂
If it’s $250 for not changing the sheets, the fee for blood on the rugs must have been exorbitant
17:30  Is it hot?  Or is it h’awt?
Loved it! 👻👻👻
This was AMAZING. Love the scary vids you guys do, keep 'em coming!
I love Rhett and link.
I've been avoiding these R&L channel videos just bc the titles didn't convince me, but now I realize I've got to watch all of these rn😂😂❤
This lady is crazy "I fireball it" ok Liu Kang thanks for saving the world..
The scariest part was how Link didn't argue to let him do the dishwasher instead.
It's like watching Statler and Waldorf walking around IRL 😂
It's been like a year since I've seen these too and suddenly this popped up in my recommended. I absolutely love them so much more outside of gmm
The short movie was unexpected but throughly enjoyed!
I predict movie directors will be calling up Rhett and Link for comedy horror movie. 🤣
That voicemail was gold
I’ve been loving all these recent R&L uploads. I wouldn’t know where to start looking for more content like this because there’s nothing else that compares! Original, creative genius. So glad they have the resources and such a skilled team behind them to make passion projects like this. Can’t wait to see what’s next!!
I love that they flipped a typical Halloween vlog “we stayed in a haunted house” to UNhaunted, and then flipped the “breaking the 4th wall” concept by essentially UN-breaking the 4th wall by going from 2nd person vlog to 3rd person cinematic. Ugh. Brilliant
This episode made my weekend! The humor, suspense, horror, plot twists, 100% certified fresh!
This was hilarious. 😂 As a Pagan, I fully believe and respect the spiritual aspect of life (and death) and whatnot, but I got big time bullshit vibes from their "cleanser." Pointing your finger and making shooting noises does not a cleansing make. It seems like the guys had a blast with this, and it was super entertaining.
The yarn work in this completely underrated.  Probably the third best yarnwork I've seen this year.
More, MORE!!
I freaking love these creepy skits they do.  This one and the staying up all night in our creator house were so visually creative
The search for Nartu Fotey
More like this please !!!
The voicemail they left has me rolling 💀😂
Its about time they retire kind of a weird to do but ok
I will never be used to Rhett saying s*** lol
PRICELESS!!!!
Here I am sauntering into watching this video, thinking it would be a light hearted comedy about our boys being silly. But the moment I blinked it turned into a horror skit. Absolutely fantastic.
Paying 1k for a scam and not paying the 270 dollars omg T-T
can't believe youtube millionaires rhett & link died to avoid a $250 charge. rip 🪦🪦
The real scary part of this short film is that THE THERMOSTAT WAS SET GO 77!!!
Next video idea: Rhett and Link visit 228 sex offenders door to door……I’d watch it’s
i want to be inside that lady's mind so badly
I would watch this show every week lmao
Oo! Who was the Extermeowizer Killer??   Was it also a ExterMOOizer Killer? Hmm?🐮🎯💥
This was exquisite! 👏
the real fear is the thermostat being on 77
Kudos to Link for the Tribe Called Quest sweat shirt✌️❤️🇬🇧👍
This video was so funny😂
3:40 the lil iroh funko is so cute i luv the atla funko pop set
this was brilliant omg
Great voicemail you guys left there 😂
NOT THE SHEETS 😭
Fire happens here idiots.
this was amazing! perfect halloween vid!! i loved the funny and spooky, plus a nartu fody callback!! <3
Wait how did they die but still do the documentary style interviews taking place AFTER the whole thing? I NEED ANSWERS! Also is the owner of the house the killer?
Brilliant, a perfect scary movie.
PLEASEEE walk through one of those ones with the scare actors
"I use my mind to close the metal hatch and then I fireball it" $997 well spent
Where is Link’s ATCQ shirt from??!
This was great! I loved it so much it was really funny and the acting at the end was awesome! also loved the callback to other parts of the video, truly a movie!
NNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!😮
I want to see them play phasmaphobia in vr together.
i wish i had a bestfriend like u 2
Rhett and Link are mentally challenged if they truly believe that woman is the real deal. Does she actually believe that she is in contact with "Jesus", "Mary", and any so called arch angels? That woman is just crazy.
I have started every day for the last 5 years with you both.  More contant guys!!! This is great.
The scariest part of this video was that the thermostat was set to 77
You know it's a good day when you have a Rhett & Link channel video
Comedy horror is the best. You all did a really good job!
Why is Link's first response to turning on a flashlight is to shine it in other people's eyes?
The fact that they paid $997 for a ghost psychic, but weren't willing to pay $250 to leave the sheets and dishwasher was a perfect touch😂
Amazing! Great job as usual.
You know its about to get real when the aspect ratio changes
it was so well done
LMAO! Only Link would worry about $250 after he spent almost $1000 one getting the house “purged” 🤭🤭🤭
Why is it so dark? 🧐🔎
Fun! Although I knew what would happen when you brought the mouse in the house out, Rhetts tell is "what in the world" :D
I really like their horror stuff. Hazel from last time had me actually scared 😂
i did not have the mouse in the house short horror film on my bingo card for this seemingly normal video, but boy was i delighted as hell by it
I don't know how you guys came up with this but I'm so glad that you did!!! This was fantastic!!!😹😻
I got a lil scared. Rip rhett and link you'll be missed
Nothing scarier than the AirBnB fines
The end of this video was actually really spooky! Loved it!!
So glad we got more Rhett and Link horror content!! I loved Hazel so much
This is, as Ken would put it, sublime! Amazing content guys! Loved it from beginning to end
Y'all need to collab with the Ghost Adventures crew
That was pretty dang good ole boys
loved it
Love how link is the one that got stabbed with the knife and he wasnt even holding it lol
Love you boys
Please make this a series 👻 maybe collab with Shane's and Ryan for one?
This was so entertaining holy moly!
This was epic
this is really impressive. i want a series.
Rhett's hatred of cats really makes it that much better 😂
clever callbacks. had to leave a like :)
Did I just hear the F word?!😮 that’s a first I feel like I’m this channel without a sensor!😳😂
Top Tier!! 😂👏🏻👏🏻
Y’all never miss with your Halloween videos!!
I kinda feel like I owe them money for this,lol😮
que miedo
The spirits get the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to get them to the light
Love this video!!! You guys always make my day! Perfectly entertaining, as usual!
The most unhinged and entertaining voicemail 😂
All for $250 dollars😅
"Damn, Jane ghosted us."  🤦‍♂
wow that was amazing
Yall got strait up scammed by jane
my favourite part was when link shined the flashlight in rhett’s eye and he didn’t even say anything, just put up a hand and carried on what he was doing 😭 big brother and little brother energy
I was so intensely invested and as usual, they did not disappoint 😅 fkin love these 2 dudes ❤
omg the ending!! the sheets and the dishwasher!  I wasn't expecting that but that's great
This was fucking awesome!
Just finished watching the ghoul boys video that just came out to be able to watch this. Amazing
“I never print photos in color” is the most Dad thing Link has ever said
They should colab with  Sam and colby fs
I’ve wanted more ever since their thriller/horror mini series on Tik Tok, a year ago. Rhett and Link bringing it back!   (The mini series was different, but the same “stuck in a house a night” theme but it was more suspenseful.)
Man the Rhett and link channel is so freaking good. It never disappoints
Not Rhett and Link getting scammed
I love this!
The voice mail was amazing!
LINK IS ROCKIN THE FUCK OUT OF THAT SWEATER! I love a tribe called quest 🥹
This was amazing! 👏👏👏👏bravo!
Now I neeeeed a collab with Shane and Ryan for an actual investigation! 😂
The voicemail they left was the funniest thing I've seen all year 😂
Good TIMES!  Man, I love how they 100% embraced their optimal 14 year old selves. This was perfection.
Absurd, I love it
I really hope no one actually believes that woman. It's so so SO insane. There are no such thing as ghosts in the first place and for anyone to think this woman 'fireballs' spirits into their place is some outrageous garbage. Just because someone died in the house, that woman turned the house into Hell.  I'm sure she laughs about it all the way to the bank.
Incredible.
Not me being actually scared lol
I havent laughed like this in a very long time!! (Since yesterday's GMM)
I think who you rented it from needs to list it as unhaunted now as well.
This it’s so funny 😭 I liked how it turned into a funny movie.
Lady has seen too many Ghostbusters movies 😂 black blobs and shit lmaooo  Then, she wanted them to call her from the hot tub
I love gmm and I think the show is better than ever but I'm so glad they're using this channel to show how creative and funny they can be.
This is incredible!!! The comedic timing is great. Such a beautifully shot short horror film
This was great!
77 degrees in that house is crazyy
Did they just pay $1000 to have some random Airbnb be de-ghost-ified? The owners of that Airbnb should be paying some of that 😂
This is one of my favorite parodies of y’all’s! Production of the horror/thriller portion was especially exceptional and as a horror enthusiast, I absolutely loved this! 😂
I was so amazingly surprised by this! You guys are just full of great ideas, keep it coming!!
Un?
My level of disappointment when I discovered the Mouse in the House game isn't real. 😞😂
Wow, just wow!
I love this That It transform from Regular to a Short Movie or flim, I love it
the thermostat being set to 77 is wild
Pays 1000 bucks for house to be cleared   Invited spirits to talk in this poor man’s house 😂
Why do i feel like mad dog lucus was the big guy
28:03 they manage to slip a joke even in tense situation 😆
bros never fail at creating a cinematic masterpiece
When I was 5-years-old in 1962, we drove back from Boston the Newport Naval Base around midnight on Halloween and stopped at a house in Fall River and my mom's fiancé told us the story of Lizzie Borden. Best Halloween ever. I wrote about it in my blog. https://briankeithohara.blogspot.com/2019/05/lizzie-borden-took-ax-and-gave-her.html
GUYS TBH THIS IS GREAT LOVED IT
We’re witnessing something special here. While film + tv are on pause due to the strikes, Rhett, Link, and the mythical team are pioneering a way to reach audiences with fun and creative content. I can’t wait for more!!!
That lady is a Whole SCAM 😂😂😂😂😂
That voice note was solid gold 😂😂😂😂
alright. this gets a thumbs up
The love and admiration I have for you two and your ability to continue to thrive creatively can only be described with words my vocabulary isn't big enough for. It's neat you exist.
10:28 exactly how I felt after hearing about the support team 🤨🧐
Link: "Toner is expensive". Sir... you're a millionaire and a print that size is probably 10 cents if not less! 😂   me an art student in college: required to print in color for every assignment and hates/ is struggling to spend around $30 a week on art prints 😭
My favorite type of videos 😭❤️
26:56 I’ve never laughed harder I’m sorry 😂😂😂😂
Easily one of the best horror shorts on YouTube. Absolute genius, en par (or maybe even a bit better than) with Hazel.
I like the original Halloween Micheal Meyers feel. Nice touch gentlemen
What an unexpected ending. Thanks guys, I’d better see a part two or else. 😂😂
I love you guys and know that this video is a parody but you should spend the night in an alleged 'haunted' house. How many 'spirits' do you think actually haunt a modern home especially if no one has died in it? You guys are too scared to stay overnight in a 'haunted' house. Prove me wrong.
This was amazing like jaw on the floor the whole time!
I just know Jane kicks ass at the D&D table.
I can’t see shït in this mask but I will find youuuuuu 😂
omg this is AMAZING
I am so happy with this! I *loved* Hazel, and Bleak Creek, and seeing more of their creepy creativity is such a treat. They do it so well and I am so pleased by this newest enstallment of Rhett and Link's spooky content!
I was thinking that in the end the second Exter-meow-nator would be Linda, having revealed that she came over as they requested haha
watching this while getting ready was a bad idea bc the last 5 minutes i was absolutely glued to my phone and now i’m late
Gosh I love these kinda videos they make
Bump
I'm going to use spiritual spackle in my everyday conversations from now on.
Great video, you guys should actually go to a haunted house
Hahaha soo funny 😂😂😂
Only 10 minutes in but this is like Nathan Fielder without the "awkward" comedy. I think you guys should keep working on stuff like this. Might make something as funny as Fielder next time.
"Love you" "Love you?" "Idk man, I got nervous"  😂😂😂😂
amazing amazing content i wish people gave this channel a chance
37625
choosing death to avoid $250 fine  but paying a medium for $997 😂😂😂
Shane And Ryan look different dont you think? 🤭
Fantastic! You guys are phenomenal! I am loving all these new videos ❤
Wow!  Really nicely done!  Acting was lovely, too!
Right….  So clearly, I have been woefully underestimating the content that could come from this channel.   To be fair, I have only very recently heard of it, but I did not expect this level of creative excellence. This was by far one of the best Skits I have ever seen, particularly when it comes to subverting expectations. I simply did not see the hard left into horror/comedycomedy coming, and it was so freaking well done.  You two and your team are the best for a reason.
What camera's do you guys use!?!! 📸
Why was this the best scary movie I have seen in a long time!
Love these videos. Makes my weekend.  ❤
I realize you guys like to sing, but I think this was the best video yet! Loved the sudden switch to 'movie' style filming, it wasnt to abrupt, just right.
Holy shit. That's something.
Y'all are actually geniuses
This is so good. The dark humor of poking fun at Airbnb and VRBO house rules and fees is *chef's kiss* perfect.
Rhett throwing the watch back INTO the hot tub absolutely SENT ME
She's  literally a master scammer, hahaha 😂
incredible!
I can't see sh*t in this mask! 😂😂😂😂
This is the highlight of my weekend
This was so well done the switch to scary really snuck up on me!
I just want to say that I am so glad you guys have began embracing this side of your creativity again. I look forward to these Saturday videos so much.
One of your best short videos so far, if not the best, especially artistically / technically. To me it is as great as the very underrated Hazel.
Wait...a 2 hour movie about a serial killer that rents out a place and theres one game to play and it's this hide and seek and as soon as you start to play he comes out to find you😮..yes please
ghost files collab when
I thought the reveal was going to be that Jane actually came over 😂😂
Why are people acting like the woman MADE them pay? 🤣 If you don’t believe in the paranormal, just say that…
To all you folks liking comments, make sure to like the video too!   PS…This was awesome, felt nostalgic in a odd way. The camera work was superb too! 💪🏾
OK IM OBSESSED 🥺🤩
I absolutely loved this video ❤❤❤
❤
omg, $1000!?!?!?
*That Was AWESOME!*   I didn't want this to end .....Encore!
I guess the lesson here is that $250 bucks is not worth more than your life.
Damn that ending is really fire!!🤘
ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BRO!!!!!!!
my jaw was on the floor when this switched to a short horror film. I've loved anticipating the points at which these videos switch over into something absurd but this was the best one yet. holy canoly you guys are so talented.
Dang, if only they found someone who could shoot $2,000 fireballs. The $1,000 fireballs never close the portals to the underworld all the way.
that voicemail was CRAZY
This was such an amazing video 😍😍😍 loved how it turned so cinematic when the game began
MY KINGS 🤩
These videos you guys have been putting on here are movie quality and absolutely love them. Keep it up country boys!
So... ya left a cliff hanger... is there gonna be a part 2, before Halloween?!
Can we make this a series ?!?! Unhaunted the series 🫶👏🙏
This could become a mini series on its own
Definitely gave Hazel vibes.
That green wallpaper is everything. I need that.
The voicemail was so funny hahah. The "staff" 😂😂
My mom would exactly died because of this LMAO
Black mirror kings
Please, do more of these!! 😂😂👻🎃
🤗🎃👻🤗
omfg this is genius
I need to setup a charlatan business like that, damn. $333 an hour...
a cinematic masterpiece
I love how, when the video wrapped up, a video of them titled "We Took a Decent Nap" popped up. How fitting. 😂
R&L are on the top of the Sketch comedy game
Rhett and Link are mastering all forms of media and every single genre! 😱🙀
Where did y'all get that wallpaper?! 😍
Did anyone else genuinely feel bad for that lady and what her life must be haha
The absolutely random Uncle Iroh Funko pop what??
The voicemail with the medium was fantastic 😂
Phasmophobia gameplay looking mad different here
Oh, man, I didn't want this to end. Any chance of a sequel?
I love these videos you guys have been making! I love all the concepts for them!
I'm starting this video this morning, and I am hoping for a NAWTOOFOTY (IYKYK) mention!
You should have brought Nartu Fowty😂
Imagine if there was a Ned situation with Rhett or Link
i actually was getting spooked haha
I wonder how much of the narrative is just made the day of. I’m guessing most aside from a general approach to the concept. I do feel like they may have brought that game. Idk.
1000 dollars for her to make some silly stuff up? yeah, I'm changing fields
As soon as I started watching I thought what are they advertising or selling with this video.  Soon as I saw the "game" I knew immediately this piece of shit is the only reason this video was made.  I'm trying really hard to stay a fan but EVERYTHING they do now is nothing more than a commercial.
I just want to know why that thermastat was on 77...geez. 😂 fr awesome video!
Not me going to the mythical society for the BTS 👀
The voicemail in the hot tub was so funny it had me in tears
i love the rhett and link videos. always the most off-beat laughs
That was so much fun, and a great twist! The joke an the end really got me 🤣
Your best acting and scripted content yet! 👏👏👏
Rhett: 4 portals to the underworld! Why do you need 4!  Link: 1 of them is a check out! sighs... lolol.
This was AMAZING. well done boys.
What did I just watch??? I thought Hazel was scary, but this one... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  Part Ghost Files, part Wes Craven, part Edgar Wright! Rhett, Link, and everyone at Mythical went to a whole other level!!! Bravo 👏
What a cinematic masterpiece! Wow wow wow!
2 dudes in a house groundbreaking 🤣
Jane, in fact, did come on over.
THE TWIST ENDING
28 spirits? Now we know why.... The ExterMeowNator
It was all a ploy to market the house as haunted! That was hilarious!
No one else makes content the way you guys do! Been watching since I was 12, please keep creating!
Wow, $1000. It's absurd how many people out there will charge an arm and a leg to do NOTHING for you but superstitious crud. 😂
Link got that Tribe Called Quest sweater on🔥🔥🔥
I’m in the wrong business
yall will never fail to make an amzing short film, back when yall did the one about the vinyl being played backwards INSANLEY SCARY. this is terrifying and funny at the same time. yall are amazing.
The title alone is so Rhett and Link 😂❤❤  Love you guys and all that you do!
That lady should be in prison
This was great!! I want a part 2!! The ending with the door shutting definitely gave horror vibes!!
The homeowner murderer was in his “locked” room waiting for his opportunity.
1) this was one of the best things ive ever seen!  2) I totally thought Link would pull the cat mask off in the fight and it would be Jane underneath 🤣
Loved this. Definitely didn’t see the ending coming.
I woulda laughed so hard if Jane had shown up in her bathing suit holding a towel and then climbed into the hot tub!
wasn't expecting the complete tonal shift but my lord did i love it
Best Halloween video of 2023 👏
Diedinhouse charges you for the search. :(
now we need a full movie from you guys this was epic
that was so cool and EPIC!
I laughed so hard all the way thru. You 2 are hilarious 😅😂
Anyone else see the weird anomaly  behind the ladies head during the video call.....
So they paid a woman a thousand dollars to play dungeons and dragons on her own in a random house
I DIED at the "goteem" part 26:15
Bravo! this was sick!!!!!
This was so friggin good!!  I love when you guys turn these I to little movies or musical numbers.. this was so f'n entertaining. I think we can all agree that Rhett voted for link to get stabbed lmao
I just absolutely love you guys as always ENTERTAINING thanks 😊
This is great! I want these to escalate till it just becomes a hardcore horror film and just totally R rated horror that it doesn't even feel like Rhett and Link had anything to do with it, because there's a lack of wholesomeness.
i wish i could watch this for the first time again
This was amazing! Seriously I don’t watch much outside of YouTube and sports and this would be a streaming series I’d never miss an episode of. Hope it makes you guys so happy making it!
HELP THE WATCH
That was GREAT GUYS!!!!
LMAO THE VOICEMAIL TO JANE IS MAKING ME LAUGH SO HARD
Hilarious, loved it!
That lady is such a scam
Not me totally in it and loving the creepy tense vibes then noticing the thermostat at 77 degrees freaking out about that lol my east coast bones could never 😅
I wish I grew up in North Carolina super religious, maybe I’d meet someone who’s as great as them lol
😾 🔪  👓
I prefer the episodes where you don’t give charlatans a platform and your money.
This is ridiculous! This lady is a scam!
That ending was so cool
That was great!
13:20 we love insane airbnb rules, totally normal to do their job for them
Why do you need 4 portals to the under world?!  Well one's like a self checkout.  😂😂💀
This video is HDR asF.
I love Great Value Shane and Ryan so much :')
“Dark blobs”.   🤔 Respect!
YESSS ever since I watched Night of Terror I've been craving more horror from these two! Stunning as always!
That was INCREDIBLE
I both appreciate and am annoyed every time link is outraged by the budget. The ultimate Dad
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT HOLY SHIT
the scariest part of this video was the fact that the house was being kept at 77 degrees
Scariest part of the video might have been the thermostat at 77
I’m kind of sad they didn’t go to an actual haunted house.
I want more 🥳
The fact the radio said "in Oxnard" scared me, thats where I live!!!
Omg, great!!!
I watch it and I was SCARED AS HELL!!! BECAUSE I HAVE  SAMAHAINOPHOBIA!!!!!!
Reminds me a little of the thing they did on tiktok. I fully enjoyed watching this short!
That voicemail message… 😂
I wish so bad to have that voicemail left on my phone lmao
THIS IS GREAT
These videos are so damn good.
Scariest part was the thermostat reading 77!
The voicemail to Jane lmaooo
So glad they’re active on this channel. The content has been amazing
77 degrees!? Damn that’s hot
I believe you guys did your best to find an unhaunted house but you guys didn't consider a killer could show up and make ghosts! On the fly ghost making.
this was fucking incredible
big paranormal fan, big rhett and link fan! so excited rn
Top notch from start to finish.      It was Jane wasn’t it? 🔪
So a sleepover?
Awesome video!
i really hope you guys would do this for real in a real haunted house not as a joke but for real
The next video suggestion "We took a nap" 😂
"It's easy to find a haunted house. You've seen em. You've seen a lot of em."   I've actually NEVER seen a YouTube video of somebody staying at a haunted house. lol
How do religious or formerly very religious people believe in the fake ghost stuff? I believe ghosts are real but these kind of people are wack
This was amazing! I loved the ending of Link being himself and thinking of the $250 charge even while he is bleeding. So so good. There should be a sequel!
wow nice production quality
Uncle iroh pop
i need her job LOL
You guys should do a video using the ghost hunting equipment at the Good Mythical studio!! 😂 it’ll pick up Rhett’s mom and Link’s dad when they speak from “heaven” lol
Fwiw, $333 per hour won’t get you a top tier attorney, at least not one from a big law firm. (Not that that means they’re worth the money….)
pay me a grand and ill say a bunch of nonsense for a video just like the lady you paid
At a time i needed them the most the delivered big time I'm a proud third degree member of gmm
I love this channel so very much. It reminds me of FND Films. I would sell my soul for you guys to collab of a skit with Fronk and Dego.
Rhett and link are amazing truly youtube royalty
Best horror film all year
Loving this type of content y’all been pushing out lately!
that was so good!!!!! I was ready for a normal Rhett and Link video but this was insane!!!
👏👏👏    magnificent 🤌   👏👏👏
THAT WAS SO GOOD
Air BnB stock just plummeted 🤣
Well done boys!
These are truly pieces of art 😭🩷
You guys could have gone room to room with Palo Santo wood, open the doors and walk around the house burning the wood and cleared it out yourself. I'd have done it for free.🤣✌️
I love this channel!!!
Oh your helping us and then?They should help pay for this service then!
these go from 0 to 60 in a second and I'm never ready for it, but I always love it
*this was an absolute masterpiece*
The scariest part of that sequence was the fact that the house is set to 77° 🥵
🤯
I prefer this long form content
I already started cry-laughing at the title of this video omg
Who else spent $11.99 at diedinhouse? 😂 thankfully my house is unhaunted
best video
Loved it. Keep on keeping on men. Xoxoxo sending ❤️ light and blessings from Ontario Canada 🇨🇦 xoxoxo ❤️
ANOTHER GREAT VIDEO. Loved it
Yeah i dont like this scripted entertainment
Best one yet 😂
so jane did indeed visit them in the house...
Y’all flipped the script on this. Genius
"Toner is expensive" god link is the definition of money didn't change me
following Garet and u guys I love this
You're telling me I can make like $300/hr by making up some nonsense?!  What am I doing with my life?
I just wanna give big props to the editing team during the exterMEOWnator game segment. Top tier video folks
Love the scripted content! so good!
That was a deadly game of cat and mouse
That was awesome! What if the other Cat Killer revealed himself and it was Cotton Candy Randy 😂
Wow, this was a great video. What a twist!
I really thought you boys spent $1000 for a con artist to lie to you about ghosts and angels.
I can't believe that con-woman charged $1000 to spiderman some energy and fireball entities out of a house. 🤯
Didn’t realize it was 30 mins until it was over lol
Please visit pdf files next!❤❤
Most awkward voicemail ever! 🤣
10 out of 10 great video
I always forget these are scripted skits, until the end and the crazy stuff happens. They are good actors lol 😂
Wow this was so well done!! Loved it!
Had a big goofy smile on my face watching this. I love GMM, but kinda fell out of watching it. Wonderful to have something to watch Rhett and Link in again. So good! <3
Why Did This Turn Into a Horror Movie at The End 😭
Okay but y’all need to go with the Watcher guys and have your whole experience with them
Please collab with shane and ryan from buzzfeed unsolved
I wish I could be a nut and get $1000 a pop!
10 out of 10
rhett saying this would be a horrible tv show of figuring out if a house is unhaunted or not, and i'm just sitting here like no this actually very entertaining and the anticipation of knowing if jane's stuff worked or not LOL
Great content
This is perfect
this was sick, great job to all involved!
Wow
“Fire happens here…idiots” 🤣🤣🤣🔥
Superb !
I literally get SO excited for these videos
I was cracking up until 24:43 When Michael Meowers showed up
4:19 My uncle died in our house... He had a heart attack
I appreciate the Uncle Iroh Pop
This website is actually real... That's crazy.
I feel like they got scammed lol
this was perfect!!!
There are way to many sex offenders in cali
Links tribe called quest shirt is awesome
Can't wait to watch this, I love unspooky stuff! ❤
Aaaah the flawless ability to mix mockumentary and a spice of fiction. You're always giving guys!
This was way too short!! I need a feature film.
Man, I need to be a ghostbuster... $333/hr!? What the heck am I doing with my life!? 😂
Rhett & Link could undo anything.
My emotions through the video 🙂🙂🙂😦😱😱😱😅😅🤯
11:32 I have no idea why I find this so funny🤣🤣🤣
I’m gonna tell my kids this is John wick
Amazing work!!!
Damn that last part is freaking good! You guys should make a horror movie!
Lol pay me 500 and I'll stay in any of the airbnb the night before you want to stay and I'll make sure it's undaunted and everything works
Love this content!!
Damn I picked the wrong profession. How can I be an internet ghost buster?!?! 😂😂😂
You know when actors say that comedy acting is the hardest, and bc of that comedy actors usually are also great doing drama? well you can clearly see that here. Also, I'm not used to see them in worried or serious faces, so that impacted me a lot, like omg they stopped being funny something must go really wrong. I have no words for the video/audio quality, and whoever directed the takes did an amazing job. I been following the guys for 7/8 years now and this content is my favorite so far. Very original, well executed. Can't wait to see whats next.
this is right here is entertainment and we all got this for free! Rhett and Link are for real geniuses!
I love these videos. They are excellent. Keep them coming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was actually super unsettling once it got going and I was NOTTT prepared! Loved it as usual!
Bahahahaha so much better than catching a fish with grandpa hahaha 😂
One of the most calming, pleasant Rhett & Link videos ever! I’m so glad the house was unhaunted!
❤👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤
fuck I always enjoy these more than I expected, y'all keep upping the ante
I really wish they had some sort of trigger warning about how often they would mention sex offenders. I get it’s part of the joke but it can also trigger some folk. (Yes, I am some folk.) A trigger warning would have been nice/welcome.
I just love how these videos start out innocent and turn into actual horror lol
I shot finger gun fireballs at my boss, gave him a discount of $300 an hour for the service. Pay got denied… this woman might be on to something though.
Can u guys just do a horror movie and stop teasing us already?! I need more content on this channel!
You think the psychic lady actually believes her own crap or she's just another grifter?
whole time im just thinkin "i hope its haunted"
This was so awesome I really enjoyed this rhett and link are such good actors well done boys I am a fan of gmm aswell ❤
Parodying the ghoul boys, I see))))
❤ love their creativity! I was legitimately surprised how it ended- keep doing these. They are awesome!
Rhett and link for dbd
If I ever lose all my morals, I know my new career will be some psychic trade. Great racket
“You don’t look exhausted, I don’t know how much work you did”  LOL LINK NEAL!!!
we need a full length movie called The Extermeownator !!
OMG I was not expecting that 😳 that was soo good
Lmao this is just Halloween: Resurrection
rhett & link posting on a nonweekday bc i'm missing gmm >>>>>>
love u guys
I’m sad Shane and Ryan were not a part of this ☹️
Link just wanted a spa weekend with his work wife😂
This was so well-made!! Would love a part two of this!
I joke about internet historian, but youneveruploadtomainchannelanymoreeee
dang dude...they dead
Rhett & Link vs Shane & Ryan
And she does it all from the comfort of her living room, what a useful bargain of a deal. Not sure if its funny or sad....
Damn guys died in house charges a fee $11.99 for one time viewing no fing way
This was fabulous! I've been watching R&L for years and introduced my son a couple of years ago. He's 8. He got scared in the last bit of the video! It was such a great and smooth transition and awesome to see the fellas use their acting chops like this! Thanks for taking the time to write and create it!!!
Easy way to make money:  Be a fraud, claim ghosts, claim you can get rid of ghosts.   Win.
Thought this was just another silly video 😂 that horror stuff caught me off guard, well done
I LOVE THIS LINK IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL 😂😂😂❤
rhett was the ghost all along
funny this is exactly what happened in the last ghost files episode on watcher
Link has expensive taste(hot tub, elevator, spa), but needs to print black and white, all on one sheet of paper, and cut out, because it's cheaper. As my grandmother would say, "grey poupon taste, on a yellow mustard budget."
I’m in the wrong business… clearly I just need to be a ghost remover 🤦🏽‍♂️
This is pretty incredible. I was hooked from start to finiah, i love the mocumentary style that turns into a short horror film. Really good!
This was an absolutely wonderful little horror short there, reminds me positively of Night of Terror. Well done, boys
The perpetrator had to be mad dog, Lucas
their conversation where to place their legs in the hot tub reminded me of bathing in things on gmm 😅
The last bit 💀
I loved that..... surely part two?
And so they were to Ram Ranch 😂
Absolutely the best things you've ever done are on this channel now. I'm re-watching this one!
Ok but what is the website you are using to check all this info because we just baught a house and i want to know if somebody died here
I’m so glad I watched this. It’s been a while since I visited this channel. 😅
awesome work :D loved it.<3
Best Saturday morning ever!
that took a huge turn lmao
I Love these
i love when Rhett realized his expensive recording device was suddenly under water. hahahaha
That lady is running the scam of the century lol
This channel is so underrated xD
This was AMAZING! So creative, so talented, so well shot and recorded. This deserves an EMMY!
Interesting way to spend a grand
This video is a made is amazing!!!!!! And the complete tonal shift when the lights got turned off and they where  playing mouse in the house that was like perfect!!!!!
rhett's hair swirl was loriel worthy🎉
We underestimate the amount of work and money that goes into productions like these. We just take them for granted. Awesome work guys! applause!
but we knew that the camera crew was there... if it would be a vlog format this might be more realistic
My guess is the psychic is the one trying to kill them.
That ending was great. The cinematography was on point!
Best ever!
This was awesome!
cool! finally some scary shit!
Another banger episode!
link would make an awesome serial killer actor he plays it so well
this is brilliant❤
I would've laughed my ass off if the Extermeownator was Jane
This was awesome!  Would love to see more scary stuff like this. ❤❤❤
The scariest part was all the ghost-related scams
Did no one notice the Uncle Iroh funko pop
As soon as they mentioned Jane, my immediate thoughts were scammer, I was correct.
Calling Jane in the hot tub was ultimate comedy im crying
Finally!!! They are doing something different besides just eating food.
this is better than 50% of halloween movies which come out. great job you guys! absolutely loved it!!
awesome video! been watching 10+ years and am obsessed with you boyz
More horror short films please
Aw the Uncle Iroh Funko <3
I never print things in color.
People seriously pay almost 1k for holy finger guns and a pew pew...👁👄👁
I couldn't not laugh at Link's face when they read there are 228 sex offenders in 3 mile radios, it's such a shockingly larg number I couldn't not laugh 😂😂😂
WOW!!! 👏😨🙌
Doris Pringle Brule!!!
You killed the watch, now the house is haunted all over again 😮
The way im watching a woman say she called upon Mother Mary at 6am on my day off 😂😂
The 228 sex offenders in a 3 mile radius is crazy. Is there a freaking prison nearby? Jesus that's quite scary.
So not used to hearing Rhett and Link swear!😂
Omg ....please tell me Jane is a troll
This is great content!!
Love this. You guys are awesome!!
rhett and link looking for spirits ghosts etc now that I'd watch
I don't want to alarm anyone, but I grew up in an unhaunted house
Now we need Ryan and Shane playing the shuffleboard game!
If this lady legitimately has more than like one client a year then it honestly feels like it should be illegal.  I don't know if she is deluded or knowingly making all this up, but once you start taking money for it it stops being silly.
Fuckin loved this one again guys!! 👍🏻 ❤😝❤😂
ugh how lucky are we that the boys are posting R&L videos again; makes me feel like I'm back in middle school watching the OG sketches/MVs 😭 amazing combo of funny and a sprinkle of scary at the end. brilliant as always 👌🏼
yes another good spooky video
This was awesome
Y'all this is too scary
To think that people really pay a thousand dollars for such obvious scams is mindblowing
Nooo don't kill my dilfs!!!
The people they find to work with 😂
I thought this was going to be a real vid of you guys staying in a haunted house :(
"Spirits don't come near hottubs, they're too hot" Link apparently hasn't watched Paranormal Activity 2 😂
The game seems cool, but this video was  just click bait to add hype.
I love the spoooky Videos  like this!!
It would be the funniest thing on Earth to see Rhett and Link collab with Ryan and Shane from Ghost Files
This is the version of Supernatural I didn’t know I needed
This video had me cackling 😭 Like the phonecall and the thing with the watch in the hot tub lmaooo
imonly 2 minutes in and LOVING this so much
I need a weekly upload of this stuff!
I loved it! If you can write this, you can surley write the sequel to the lost causes of bleak creek, right?
link only printing tiny black and white houses 😅
This was great! Nicely done lads...
Holy smokes, didn't anticipate a full on cinema level horror trailer at the end! 😂
Either that lady is delusional or she's delusional
🐭🐁 🐈😺 that is the dumbest game EVER 😂😂😂😂
$1,000 ghost clearing lady really had me cringing...
The true haunting is airbnb fees
Love this spooky and hilarious content from you guys!
Why is hearing Rhett and Link cursing so unsettling?😭
Great production! The camera work with Rhett behind the curtains, the other cat whatever, and game.  The watch tho… 😭😭
I'm a big horror fan and this was so well made, funny and creepy
Some of my favorite 🌽 films start this way. In fact, I’m pretty sure I recognize that hot tub.  A different kind of geyser cleansing altogether might have been called for. And a blacklight.  Definitely going to be more haunted by what’s still alive. AirBnB in the Valley at your own risk, kids. ☔️
Always a huge fan of more skit content happening on the channel
This is the best so far!
I look forward to these episodes so much!  Makes my early Saturday workday better.
Calm down 😂 Ghostbusters 😂😂😂
All I can think is ghost files with Ryan and Shane 😂
Rhett’s face when he realized the person in the suit wasn’t Link was the best part
This was so good. Loving this content guys 👻
These videos are such a treat! Love it! I wish I had a friend to do silly things with. I guess my wife will have to do.
Very nice
This made me fart 😮
How do ghosts feel about meth? They Boo-f it
How can ya'll do all that with straight faces? haha
The hide and seek was a cinematic massterpiece! Spielberg eat your heart out.
Needs to be a show where the "medium" is taken to a house/location they have no clue about. That'll last one episode....and won't get aired. Just saying. Prove me wrong.
I think this works better as a pure narrative by not bringing in someone who actually thinks supernatural baby babble is real.
this is so reminiscent of that one gmm episode where they went to a water tank of some sort and came out of it in a weirdly calm state
That was amazing
That lady saw you coming. IMHO she's full of shite js
Links face when she’s talking about who she works with 🤣
The type of haunted content I'm down to watch - yet I've never seen anything like this. Keep it up with these videos! No one else produces with this vibe
I LOVED THIS! Amazing job. I hope to see more fun and creative stuff like this. I love GMM, but breaking the mold a bit to stretch your legs is always cool. Props to everyone involved.
rhett breaking a watch by accident must be the funniest thing lol
The Nartu Foti throwback made me very happy 🤣
i hope we see more videos like this ^^
I could easily watch this for two hours
Yes I finally got here in a reasonable time.
Lol that costs money to use?!
This just totally made my weekend!
I literally just started, and I’m just blown away by that gorgeous wallpaper 1:15
You can’t trust a camera crew to save you…great for content though!
That classic Rhett and Link finish. Loved it!!
Good god man, this is life transcended! ❤️‍🔥
Love these guys! ❤❤❤❤❤
Beautiful.
this was amazing lol
Bravo gentlemen
actually so cool and well done, love that they don't mind going for more vulgar content
Props to Jane the ghost lady for trying to get some hot tub action
Could someone link the part where they take their shirts off and kiss?
I LOVE this video!😊
every time, i think the next video can't be better than the one before they prove me so incredibly wrong. this was amazing. i hope we get to see more of stuff like this!
The little Rhett and link logo in the bottom of the video is very bright and distracting
the ending gave me THE CHILLS man!! definitely wasn't expecting that, awesome job guys!! ❤
I'm scared!!! My greatest fear is... a lack of ghosts!
Amazing!!! Well done to the team!!! This is how film making works Hollywood!!
its actually wild how fast this went from a funny parody video to an unironically great short movie. rhett and link truly are special
Y'all look sleepy what's up? BOO
What scares me is how stingy Link is These little black and white pictures will haunt me forever XD
I get that Link needs to live the brand, but c’mon man!  The hair needs a trim, it is going waaaay up! He looks goofy.
Boo
this was awesome
Poor Jane, having to listen to that voice mail
7:56 what is that, a skull behind her head?
love Link's ATCQ hoodie!
Why didn't they turn the lights back on when they had to load the dishwasher and change the sheets lmao 😂
I can't even express I much I loved this. xD
This is giving me Watcher vibes.  Ryan is Link and Shane is Rhett
Horrifying, yet hilarious! 😂
If only the Buffy the Vampire slayer knew about how to vanquish hellmouths.
Y'all sure know how to make a non scary situation scary
scary 🙏
Thank goodness the bois uploaded. 🎉
wish someone was  paying me 1k to write  lore for random houses
stop calling it haunted, they were people at some stage like us.
This video made me realize that millionaires still care about $250 :( RIP Rhett and Link
Voicemail to Jane ... love you 😂
That voicemail was so stressful to witness. We've all been there...
dude the Internet is a blessing
jane was real excited to see u girls in the hot tub
How do ghosts feel about meth, i hope that gets explored this episode.
Im so glad that they brought back this channel, these skits are amazing, every video is a different experience, and this one was legitimately scary!
The amount of people that will think this is real and not a skit is actually insane
LOVED this one. So intelligently done, with the callback to the AirBnb house-rules ending it. The tonal shift to the tense horror actually worked so well and it was genuinely creepy while being hilarious.
😂😂😂
Everyone knows in a scary movie…You NEVER go back in the house once you are out. 👻 🔪 🩸
I used to be a big fan of GMM and watched every single day and was a fan of the first hour. The music videos, commercials,...it was all so grand. With GMM, I felt that after a while the food content took over a bit too much and that kind of turned me off, but these videos are just incredible and I really love this type of content from you guys. The best kind of random yet also not random at all.
Spending a grand to clear the ghost-like entities is totally worth it! Now you should have hired another person to independently verify her work though. And maybe a third to just be really sure of it being cleared though.
I was expecting a cut to Rhett trying to pick up a dishwasher
glood video
Masterpiece 💯🤌🏼
no bc the ending horror movie was so cool
A Rhett and Link video has never scared me this much before
The visuals on the hide and seek are actually incredible!! wow! whens the movie coming out?
That lady is a scammer and delusional
It was Moochelle . Coming back for revenge
Now they gotta do a real HAUNTED house, just to compare the evidence. This is the only way we can make sure this house is UnHaunted! ;)
$997 for a lady to spew bullshit on a couple of video calls is a hell of a job. I could do that.
You guys just got fleeced out of 2k by a crazy person  .
Lol now this is some top tier content 👍🏻
ohhhhh MAN I’ve been waiting for this since..! Well since The snippet teaser the posted on instagram but GOLLY am I excited!
When they said how much they paid, like "Nine ninety seven" or something similar, I thought they meant $9.97 and was like, that's cheap. Didn't occur to me that they meant almost $1k 😂
Damn is this lady delusional
ive been hoping theyd do another video with narty fody
That ending, jsut brilliant
Much scarier than a haunted house
The exorcist lady was low key trying to get a steamy hot tub face time with 2 dad bods
"THERE'S A SPA" - Link Neal, 2023
"Hergle herble!"
the fact that this came out on the same day as a ghost files episode
😂 the lady seems like one of those “Internet Medium” types 🤣
Yall got hustled by that lady for 1000 bucks.
I'm half asleep and I can barely thinkk understand this
The way that they both side eye the camera when they think it BS is just fantastic. lol
THIS IS IT!
The contrast between the TINY Black and white print outs vs the glossy full colour is chef's kiss
its GMM-like lines, but TV-level camera moves. <3 lol
Rhett and link never fail to clap my cheeks
The opposite of Garrett’s new video
Why is Iroh there? I love that he's there
I do love them doing 'skits' that are 30 minuets long lol. I love their show, but a decent video outside of their desks is nice too. They should do one of these every other week, and like 4 episodes a week of the GMM - I wouldnt mind that. Balance out the projects, still end up with a video everyday or whatever
Bright daylight, modern house, now where. Are. These. Ghosts?
ryan and shane are shaking right now
LOVE YOU RHETT, NEW SINGLE IS AMAZING <3
hey. we needed their weird characters to investigate. The one where Rhetts' hair is everywhere, and Link with a weird accent XD lol. But this is fine too XD
Hi
