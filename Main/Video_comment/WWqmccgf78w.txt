how did we achieve "the discovery of dark energy" as you stated at 1:40 ?  We observed apparent expansion acceleration and then THEORIZED  dark energy as the cause.  Did we observe expansion rate in all areas of the universe ?  Did we compare expansion over 13.8 billion years to see if it was the same throughout time ?  At that moment of "discovery", did we understand the extreme clumpiness of matter in the universe ?  Pretty naive to declare "discovery" when we were missing so many fundamental factors.
I know that these animations are not proven fact, and are graphing the movement of ridiculous amounts of matter over ridiculous¹⁰ distances, but the fact that they do look like soap bubbles blows my mind the most, I think.
Ridiculously large local hole, relatable
This is exactly what is happening in spacetime! The Eminence gravitational pull is creating large Super Clusters while creating the Voids or expansion of the Universe! It acts like a positive & negative battery charge! Electromagnetism was discovered by James Clerk Maxwell & his equations lead to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity! The cosmic web is best described by Physicists as String Theory, Quantum Mechanics & Entanglement! The key to the Universe is right there in the center of the CMB! The Great Attractor is controlling the Universe itself while also being pulled by an even larger gravitational force! This could be a whitehole or the remnants of the birth of the Universe. The Universe is Recycling itself & has been doing so from the beginning of time!!!⏳⏳⏳
dang thats a good shirt with the lambda in it
Has dark energy really been discovered?  Or has it been postulated?
It would be easier to just rely on empirical data and observe nature: fractalized quantized space-time geometry. Because nature's composed of fractals. Space-time is not smooth, but exhibits self-similar structures at all scales, from quantum scale to the cosmic level. The cosmological constant as an emergent property of space-time structure,  eliminating the need for fine tuning. The emergent fractal space-time geometry can reinterpret dark matter and dark energy, therefore not need for exotic matter and energy. Inflation theory would be also a thing of the past, when the big bang theory happened everywhere, not as a singularity. The uniformity of the self repeating pattern would explain the isotropy of the CMB after the cool down.
All of the above is based on assumptions:  Matter is evenly distributed; Type 1B supernovae are all exactly the same;  The CMB is a reliable data set.  What could go wrong?  Ya know what they say about the word "assume"...
The local hole? Sounds like my ex wife!
It is clear that the cosmological controversy will not be resolved with this simple argument, because the dilemma is more serious and affects imperial authoritarianism, including the military lobby that supports continuous war to sustain the economy, that is, official science at the service of war.  Nothing will change until it is too late for humanity.  Official science as a whole has to change because it is absurdly wrong.
we're so back
This really reminds me of the Timescapes theory, where on top of voids expanding there's also a time dilation effect in the filaments which would be absent or at least less present in voids, which effectively means voids wouldn't just be expanding, their expansion would also seem to accelerate.
Is that the Elden Beast
Why Are The Giant Voids in Space, Round?  Why are the  giant voids in space round? Why are they shaped like a globe, sphere, or bubble.  Shouldn't  they have an abstract shape?   See drawing .  Voids are vast regions of space with few or no galaxies. For example the Bootes Void is  330 million light years in diameter.  But why do they have a spherical shape? Voids have the shape of a bubble caused from an explosion from within that pushes out in all directions, or a balloon being inflated. Or it's like a bubble formed out of boiling water. What force in the void is pushing out equally in all directions?  Galaxy clusters on the other hand are strung together like strands of hair formed around the voids. They do have random shapes.  We know that there is a mysterious force called dark energy that makes up 70% of the universe. Dark energy is expanding the universe from everywhere in the universe. Dark energy has enough force to push galaxies apart. This seems to be the most likely explanation for the force coming from the voids.  Dark energy acts like a reverse gravity force out of empty space that pushes matter away.  Common sense says that empty space should be filling in, not busting out!  It should have a random shape caused by the galaxy clusters around it, not a round shape that seems to push out from inside the emptiness of the void.  Something major is missing in our understanding of voids, galaxies, dark energy, gravity, and the structure of the universe.
I think we need a second parter. There's as of ~2025 start, we have another void paper, with a "Timescape". Also, I'm surprised it isn't mentioned: "the local lump" 4:45
The thumbnail made me think this was an elden ring video
Wow, an Australian astrophysicist does not even mention New Zealand Physicist David Wiltshire in this video on cosmic voids.  Wikipedia does at least mention Wiltshire.  Shameful PBS Spacetime!
Can we get an update on this topic in light of new paper - Supernovae evidence for foundational change to cosmological models?
It's weird (to me) that General Relativity isn't considered - since the amount of matter/gravity in an area affects the relative rate of time passage in that area, maybe consider that time is moving more quickly in voids and therefore space is expanding more quickly there relative to filaments? I don't know how much of an effect this has, I ain't doin' the math, but it must have some effect.
The distance ladder measurements of Ho from supernovae are well beyond the local void, which if not properly accounted for motion, would distort the value derived from even closer distances. Homogeneity scales and DE….these may be strongly correlated, or…not.
And people made fun of me for obsessing over “nothing”
one of your best videos!
I don't know what you mean by "a vacuum energy".  None of these concepts are very well defined at all.  Is it just a number you put in all of space to make the equations work?
The idea of dark energy is so annoying to me, so this void bubble explanation is very reliefing cause ain't no way there's something confusing with your calculations then interperet it into the physical stuff by slapping "dark" in front of it, and call it a day. Either the system is wrong, or there is another explanation.   No hate to the scientists tho, frying their brain to figure out this stuff must be very painful, but it just proves that science isn't patent and creativity is still needed in it.
The fundamental assumptions of an isotropic and uniform universe are starting to fall apart.
Can the cosmological crisis be resolved? No, not yet I'm afraid. We're doomed!
If Dark Forest Theory is true, the explanation of cosmic voids has a terrifying solution.

We need a Matt / Dr. Becky collab asap!
Matt loves Becky!! Matt loves Becky!!!
Comment responses will never return as Matt's postponing is being stretched by the expanding spacetime: scheduled comment response date is now beyond the affectable time-horizon.
I've wondered how or if the difference in the time dilation in voids vs dense regions would effect the observed expansion given that voids have had more time to expand than dense regions. Especially when, at least as far as I understand it, the universe expands exponentially.
All theoretical physics, what if we consider bodies that have gravitational pulls would have its own space time.What we observe with radio frequency or spectral wont account for other variables. Perhaps when space lab is built with micro gravity can be observed some answeres that will lead to more insight.
Please  simulate  positive and negative  matter (mass/energy) distribution - like +/- charge, but  like mass polarity attracts, opposite  repels.   Negative  mass cluster = positive mass void.  Voila!  :=)
Many thanks! A very important topic  for deep open global brainstorming. I recall Bertrand Russell's  philosophical thought: “What people really want is not knowledge, but confidence.” Complete uncertainty in the basics of knowledge: The "Big Bang"... the "singularity".. . "inflation"... "collapse"... "multiverse"... "dark matter"... "antimatter"... "dark energy"...."local hole"..."empty bubbles"... Fundamental science has "rested" on the understanding of space and matter (ontological structure), the nature of "laws of nature", the nature of "fundamental constants", the nature of phenomena of time, information, consciousness. It's time to realize that quantum theory and general relativity are phenomenological (parametric, operationalist. "effective") theories without ontological justification (ontological basification). John A. Wheeler, “unsung model of science”: "We are no longer satisfied with understanding only particles, force fields, geometry, or even time and space. Today we require physics to have some understanding of existence itself." To understand EXISTENCE itself means to "grasp" (understand) the nature of the primordial TENSION of the Cosmos, to understand the nature of space and time. And for this it is necessary to "grasp" the original generative structure of matter - "La Structure Mère" (ontological SuperStructure). That is, to build a model of the metaphysical triad "being-nothing/otherbeing-becoming". The paradigm of the Universe as an eternal holistic generating process ("PARADIGM OF UNDERSTANDING") gives a new look at matter. MATTER is that from which all meanings, forms and structures are born. Space is an ideal entity, an ideal limit for the states of matter. The ontological structure of space (absolute, ontological, existential) is rigidly connected with the absolute forms of the existence of matter (absolute states). And there are three and only three of these states: absolute rest (linear state, absolute Continuum,   ideal image, form - "cube", "Cartesian box") + absolute movement (vortex, cyclic, absolute Discretuum, ideal image, form - "sphere") and their synthesis - absolute becoming (wave, absolute wave, absolute Dis-Continuum, ideal image, form - "cylinder"). What is especially important: each absolute form of the existence of matter has its own ONTOLOGICAL PATH (bivector of the absolute state). Accordingly, SPACE (absolute, ontological, existential) has three ontological dimensions / 9 gnoseological dimensions. But we must "dig" deeper into ontology in order to “grasp” the MetaNoumenon — ONTOLOGICAL (structural, cosmic) MEMORY, “soul of matter”, its measure. Ontological (structural, cosmic) memory is that "NOTHING" that holds, preserves, develops and directs matter (enteleschia, nous, Aristotle's "mind-prime mover"). To understand SPACE and TIME we must move from the physicalist concept, the simple ideality of “SPACE-TIME” to the ontological concept of “SPACE-MATTER/MEMORY-TIME”. That is, to generating processes with memory. More than a quarter of a century ago, the mathematician and philosopher Vasily Nalimov set the super-task of building a "super-unified field theory that describes both physical and semantic manifestations of the World" - the creation of a model of the "Self" -Aware Universe" (V. Nalimov, 1996). In the same direction, the ideas of the Nobel laureate in physics Brian Josephson (which are not very noticed by mainstream science), set out in the essay "On the Fundamentality of Meaning" (2018). Brian Josephson: “Physicists' immersion in search of their 'theories of everything' has led them to an oversimplified picture of the natural world. To a picture that can work very well in situations used to test physical theories. But this picture is completely incapable of clarifying and helping to deal with such problems as observation, the meaning of the observed and the processes of thought.” Fundamental science requires a Big Ontological Revolution in the metaphysical / ontological basis. Physics must move from the stage "Phenomenological physics" to the stage "Ontological physics". The paradigm of the Universe as a WHOLE must come to the aid of the “part paradigm” that dominates science. The New Information Revolution is also pushing for this. J.A. Wheeler: "To my mind there must be, at the bottom of it all, not an equation, but an utterly simple idea. And to me that idea, when we discover it, will be so compelling, so inevitable, that we will say to one another, 'Oh, how beautiful.' How could it have been otherwise?'". Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: "The true physics is that which will, one day, achieve the inclusion of man in his wholeness in a coherent picture of the world." A.N. Whitehead: "A precise language must await a completed metaphysical knowledge."
How would one even study the voids? What can be observed of them other than CMB?
I love the idea of cosmic voids as bubbles.  Makes perfect sense
7:50 nice
Okay, imagine the universe is like a giant pizza. When it was fresh out of the oven (the Big Bang), it was small and smooth. As it cooled down (expanded), stuff started clumping together like the cheese and toppings. These clumps became galaxies and galaxy clusters.  Now, there are two big mysteries about this pizza-universe:      Dark Energy: Something is making the pizza expand faster and faster, like it's being stretched from the edges. We call this mysterious force "dark energy."      Hubble Tension: When we try to measure how fast the pizza is expanding, we get different answers depending on whether we look at the crust (early universe) or the toppings (modern universe). It's like the crust is expanding slower than the toppings, which is weird.  Here's where the "voids" come in. These are the empty spaces between the toppings, like the gaps between pepperoni slices. Some scientists think these voids might be playing a bigger role than we thought:      Local Hole: Our own galaxy sits in a giant void called the Local Hole. This void might be pulling on nearby galaxies, making them move away faster than expected. This could explain the Hubble Tension, but it's still not clear if the Local Hole is real or just a measurement error.      Void Bubbles: Some even wilder theories suggest that all these voids, acting like giant bubbles, could be the real cause of dark energy. Imagine the bubbles pushing the pizza apart as they expand. It's a cool idea, but needs more evidence.  The main point is, we used to think of the universe as a smooth pizza, but it's actually quite lumpy. These lumps, especially the voids, might be messing with our measurements and understanding of dark energy and the universe's expansion. It's like trying to figure out how fast the pizza is expanding by only looking at the pepperoni, without considering the empty spaces in between. So, scientists are now trying to map out these voids and see how they affect the bigger picture.
There is a good feeling to the cosmic voids expanding bubbles explanation for the Hubble Tension, indicating a Universe more complex in its interactions than assumed in the simpler past.
the camera was out focused during making this video
I remember reading maybe or hearing somewhere, I'm not exactly certain which... but the statement, "The only thing we know certain about Dark Matter.. isnthat we call it Dark Matter"  And that's such an entertaining point because, how ARE you supposed to test something, or for it in general.. if you don't have any idea on how to interact with it directly, or even indirectly.
Lumpy Space
AT LAST !Of course the voids are pushing! Strip Perlmutter of his awards!
It`s a brilliant idea, hope cosmic voids be proven to be true!
Sorry, I must go poop.
Thats funny, 'The Local Hole' is my nickname.
Sounds like more support for my speculative time force hypothesis. In short the our universal 3d fabric is the surface of an expanding hypersphere in 4d space away from a universal orgin point 0,0,0,0. Dark energy being the energetic pressue differential between inside the hypersphere when compare to outside the hypersphere caused by the "first cause" the big bang. The inertia of mass resists the expansion creating a surface topography described by GR where the voids would appear like growing mountains on the hypersphere's surface. Matters  intrinsic quest to find the path of least resistance falls to the valleys of the topology collecting like water/rivers resembling a cosmic web. These collection areas increase the overall inertia in those regions of 3d space creating a feedback loop which gives the illusion of the void pushing outward from their centers. In other words the rate of expansion with in the voids of the surface continue to outpace the  valleys due to less material resisting expansion therefore the velocity away from orgin point 0,0,0,0 is less within the valleys. The rate of acceleration in unencumbered space is Newtons Big G and the rate of expansion in encumbered space is Newton Big G less the resistive values of the inertia of matter creating a slope in the fabric of space we call gravity as Einstein suggest. The equations of GR discribe the surface of our 3d fabric like a sort of topological map key.   Speculation is the seed of innovation. Without the ability to speculate one would lack the ability to find deeper truths.
Realy I like this video so so much its interestyng
I'm always delighted when Dr. Becky explains something, I always learn a lot from her vids. I would be a heckin heap of a lot more delighted if she had an OnlyFans, but she doesn't. Believe me, I've looked.
Crisis in cosmology, the universe created in human brain.
Model is wrong.
Gimme more space
or maybe there is no dark matter at all, and voids are just a absence of space
If void bubbles were the case the rate of expansion should crest and slow down in half life.
People have stopped calling Matt Tyrion
I never thought I'd hear about lumpy space outside of adventure time, but here we are.
Hi is this theory correct, because if so it solves most problems in physics..:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxdCY2UPhTk
I'm firmly in camp bubble. Then again I also believe light can't escape a black hole because the high density prevents the passing of time.

so cool
Ah, more science fiction.
I read a paper a few years ago (or, I read an abstract and skimmed the paper) that suggested if our models more accurately modeled relativity, instead of relying on the Friedman equation, time/space dilation effects could explain away dark energy. Do any of you know what paper I'm referring to? I can't seem to find it. I'd like to see how many citations it has earned.
Dear whoever edits/does music for these,  PLEASE make the outro quieter! I love listening to these before bed and the last 15 seconds is so much louder than the enter episode. THANK YOU!   Sincerely, An overworked mom who just wants to peacefully learn and fall asleep to science
So please if anyone can correct me if I am wrong. so based on this results does that mean that the universe is static and there is no such thing called the expansion of the universe..? also if that's true what a bout inflation in the begaining of the universe..?
Imagine if you could be able to look at the universe from immensely far away, with time acceleratrd, without your obervation being limited by the speed of light, seeing galaxies move, voids form and clusters form.
Is an einstein ring the superposition of the star behind it?    Is it the wavefunction of that star? 😮    The uncertainty of it's definite position?
There are scales in our universe that are so immense, it's understandable if we can barely grasp them. Dynamic chaotic systems are hard for our simulations to comprehend. Especially vast systems. What if at those immense scales, we don't yet fully grasp how things fully work? Like density, friction, Electromagnetism, static charges, fluid dynamics, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, gravity, etc. *I think there is a lot left to learn about these behaviors on VAST scales throughout our cosmos? Especially when talking about scales of galactic filaments, multiple galaxies interacting, and many many more cosmic bodies & structures.  We are getting better & better at certain things but some things are just so vast that it's understandable if we don't fully grasp them yet. I'm curious to see where things go as we advance our ability to measure & comprehend these things. Not just on large scales but the extremely small scale as well. When it comes down to our simulations, the smallest changes in our measurements can change so much. I'm just hoping we learn certain things in my lifetime. I'm really curious where future discoveries will lead us.
thank you
Thank y'all for the enlightenment and open honest conversations that come from it  May y'all's Journey Only Be Better Blessed... 🫶, B🌞 B.R.A.T.😇 Bryan Robert August Thul👻 ONELOVE (The TRINITY) SOURCE.
"Bubbles" are (seem..) misleading;  ..'because they're unnecessarily confusing if simple expansionsion pressure exerts (albeit minute) sufficient pressures to oblige the same behavioral effect which "dark matter" would cause by attraction instead.  Regardless (perhaps, IDK) of initial early spontaneous collapses (or not) within 'voids', secondary collapses at (thence 'pressed') "filaments" ought 'leave any residual 'holes' along their lengths, too, now wrapping 'round residual galactic bars.., to supplement (complement) the same differential expansion pressure in later days? Thx.
Cosmic voids are terrifying to me. Thinking about a space that big with virtually nothing in it is unsettling to say the least.
I've played enough warframe to know to stay away from the void😂
You guys really need to update the models you operate under
Bonjour   🤔🤔 Nerdy Savant  PhD  Dude  , the Voids in the CMB MATRICES.... "Engage " .  Have a prosperous  Year of the Dragon 🐉 😎   Adieu
0:55 Mfffrt, George "Lematra" ?? :'D I love it, thank you Matt for this pronunciation pearl 😌🤌✨  (btw today's french tip : it's pronounced somewhere close to "Lemehtr", with the french "r")  Also awesome video, this is all so exciting !! :o The prospect of dark energy being the result of cosmic void bubbles acting like negative pressure is genius, it seems so perfect, I almost want this to be the answer :')  But until we get the solution to all this, I can't wait for us to learn more about this mystery and its implications, thank you for transmitting it to us like this ! 💚☄️
sure, i believe that, because the Voids are pure "unbend" spacetime, just sitting there "relaxed", at its natural volume, because there is no matter to take away its natural state of "flatness"!
Soooo...the Universe is fizzy? Bubbly?😊
Dark energy is a myth. It is only a rationalization of our incorrect early measurements. New measurements from JWST are showing that dark energy is not real.
The Hubble constant is wrong. jWST is slowly but surely proving it.
What if the cosmological constant varies over the history of the universe?
It is fully possible that matter is distributed evenly, while antimatter is not, and antimatter has the potential so possess negative mass in some cases, and space with negative mass expands, while places with positive mass contract. If this were true, it would make sense that we see so much empty space, and that galaxies spin at discrepancy with GR and SGR, without the addition of dark matter equations. It could simply be that negative mass expands while positive mass contracts and attracts itself.
Since I was about 20 and starting my study of cosmology and physics, i have always thought that  dark energy could be simply the sum effects of the voids in between galaxies and galaxy clusters. Im happy to see the idea given careful consideration.
What would be the implications of voids being the source of dark energy as far as long term expansion of the universe is concerned? Is heat death still inevitable?
OH no more flat Earth stuff
"Impossibly large" structures have been found many decades ago with Keck and other instrumentation. It seems folk are finally catching on.
I remember some hypothesis a long time ago claiming that they could explain the Hubble Tension away if C had a different value in the early universe, but I never heard anything else about that for a few decades.
137 inches to millimeters conversion. The 137 drop. Look it up! 137 13.7 billion years 137 fine structure consistentcy.....it's A  METRIC
Huh… that’s a wild cliff hanger. Tell us more about the bubble paper!  Oo I wonder if there is a suction effect going on too. Like a leaf after a truck blows past it. So the clustering galaxies into the filaments pulls the spacetime behind it to make the bubbles expand and that’s the part of space that’s really stretching
6:50 "The Local Hole" was my nickname in college /jk
Interesting the anology of bubbles. If true, wouldn't that mean that between bubbles the movement towards the ends could be at a a stop or start slowly and then go more quickly in momentum. Wouldn't that mean that some galaxies are moving slower in some areas and faster in others? Wouldn't that put hubble's constant in question?
"La Maitre" is pronounced "Lah MEH-truh"
Please delete the distracting background "music" from this wonderful source of information.
are you implying that the universe has a cosmological case of indigestion?
Can i borrow a graviton while interest rates are low?😂
Thank you  that was absolutely fascinating.  Really interesting to hear what the structure of matter in the universe can do to itself.  Also, I didn't know we were in a void bubble that's also really interesting!
Shout out to Dr. Becky who thinks Oppenheimer was the first to write a paper on black holes? 🤣
We are bubble stuff . Carlos Sagón
Good stuff, Matt, and very glad to see you're comparing notes with Dr Becky, the other absolute best cosmology commentator on YouTube!
To be fair, it takes a special type of person, who arrives fresh-faced and keen at university, with a burning desire to turn his telescope away from all the good stuff, and study the empty bits.
Eylül 2019’da ve 15 Temmuz 2020’de iki defa fikirlerime ve araştırdığım konulara ait bilgilerim (USB aygıtları içinde) iki ayrı ülkenin devletleri tarafından gasp edildi. İddiam deli saçması gibi görünüyor ama gerçektir ve uzun bir hikayedir. O yıllardan bu yana, ardı arkası gelmeyen bu tip makaleleri, sözde teori ve keşifleri yayınlayanlar, kendilerinin reklamını yapan böyle Youtube kanallarını beslediler. Bunlar aşağı yukarı trol kanallardır. Çalınan bilgilerimin içeriğinde asla bitirmediğim bir bilimkurgu romanı ve şu anda bir platformda kendi çapımda yayıladığım “Siyah Saf Işık” adlı kitabım ile, bu kitapların bin sayfayı aşan notları bulunuyordu. Bu devasa bilgi şebekesi dünya çapında her türlü medya araçlarına, film ve dizilere kadar kullanılacak bilgileri dağıtıyor ve seçili güçlü fikir ve unsurlar kullanılıyor. Alıntı ya da aslında hırsızlık yaptıkları kaynağı sanki hiç yokmuş gibi davranıyorlar. Yeni fikirler üretmiş ve keşifler yapmış gibi bu çalıntı bilgileri kendilerine malederek kullanıyorlar. Fakat geleneksel konseptlerine yama yapar gibi adapte etmeye çalıştıklarından değişik uyum sorunları ortaya çıkıyor ve ileri sürdükleri fikirler saçma, mantıksız görünüyor ya da içinde kullanıldığı üründe uyumsuz duruyor. Ama kazanma ve büyük işler başaran taraf olma derdinden muzdaripler bunlar, mutlaka kar elde etmeliler. Örneğin bu videoda işlenen konu açıkça 5 Aralıkta ve düzelterek 15 Aralık’ta iki defa yayınladığım kitapta işlenen konudan açıkça alıntı ya da çalıntı yapılarak sanki yakın zamanda keşfedilmiş gibi sunulan, büyük boşluk denilen yerler ile (Neredeler ve kaç taneler? Eminim gerçek bir fikirleri de yok.) karanlık enerji (uydurma yorumlara dayalı bir olgu) arasında ilişki kurmak. Şunu söylemeliyim: Sizin anlayışınıza göre (Bilimsel veriden çok, onun sınırlı versiyonundan üretilen inançtır bu) sözkonusu uzaysal delik tarzı bu büyük boşluklar nesnel unsurları üzerine çekmektedir. Bu boşlukların evrenin güya her yerinde var olan toplamlarının enerjisi nasıl evrenin genişlemesine yol açar? Tersine önce lokal çöküşlere, sonra da büyük çaplı kozmik kargaşa ve hatta felaketlere yol açmaları gerekir. Ne gözlemlediklerinizi ne de çaldığınız bilgiyi doğru dürüst yorumlayamıyorsunuz. Hoş gerçeklere ulaşmak için yorumdan çok gerçekten doğrulanmış veri gerekir. Fikir üretmek orijinal ve çalıntı olmadıkça iyidir ama gerçek bilgi başka bir şey. Sizin işiniz ise inanmak va SAÇMASAPAN yorumlamalar yapmaktan ileri gitmiyor. Ve keşke şu yorumlarınızı sadece “gerçekten kendinizin keşfettiğiniz bilgilerin desteğiyle” yapsanız.
I'm guessing that response to comments in the videos are gone for good at this point. The credits don't even mention when they will return now.
This thing at 8.40... using color to measure  distant is so false... this is not how the universe works...
7:53 you missed the perfect opportunity to call that constant 'nice'
I saw Dr. Susskind talking about quantum complexity, and how it could be used to explain the infinitely expanding interior of a black hole (his words) and potentially thwart heat death. It sounded a lot better coming from him, of course, but several other people mentioned this "complexity" (I believe there's even a law regarding it?). The basic concept is obvious, and I can vaguely comprehend its function in quantum mechanics, but it was only discussed briefly and I didn't fully understand what exactly they were suggesting. Is this a topic you could share some insight on?
Good thing I'm a Gemini
I have been watching SpaceTime since Power Metal Stance Mat was still around, every single video, usually on day 1.  I admit, I don't have notifications turned on, mainly cause I don't like being notified of every little thing that goes on, my email inbox is the stuff of nightmares.  But lately, despite my obvious and consistent interest in your channel, it doesn't show up in my feed, which is sad.  But I've enjoyed your content for so long, I'll go out of my way, and check for more content now and then.  Really, I just want to say that the youtube algorithm sucks, and does not reflect my interests very well, and I wish that the nonsense shorts that keep being pushed would stop.  Also, I miss Power Metal Stance Mat, and I wish he'd show up, just a quick cameo, now and then.
Time allows for iterations within the universe. Space allows for a place for iterations to occur. expanding space due to time should be related to entropy and enthalpy ratio shifts between macro and micro scales - movement, flow, revising the 'balance of [power]' until a dark freeze from expansion, but a true dark freeze would mean (in this scenario) time collapsed on itself (in essence) because there are no more iterations to go through. So the hyp is the collapse of time would lead to another big bang explosion. mechanism how isn't my department!
This was a nice dive, for a non-mathematician like me!             Thanx!!!
A new born profession.
This bubble idea is a winner
Since when did we "discover" dark energy? It's a theory, and one that fails in more than one scenario. Right?
I guess that if this is true, it would not only kill dark energy but also MOND.
I would suggest to watch recent lectures of Neil Turok in which he finds a more simple approach to dark matter and expansion based solely on the standard model and einsteins equasions in wich no inflation and other stuff like strings is neccesary to explain the cosmology. He also predicts from first priciples that dark matter is a right handed stable neutrino. Data from euclid might be able to prove this in coming years.
The last bit @ ~ 13:00 about the "back reaction" makes total sense in the way that we already proved that to be true on the "small" scale by using the gravity of other planets to launch our "deep" space satellites farther faster.  And can be articulated similarly to the string theory.
We need a Dr. Becky / Space Time collaboration! Maybe you guys can figure it all out by making a video :)
Bandage after bandage .. I feel like physics needs to start from scratch.
You gotta clean up the space-time outro sequence XD. its getting so long winded keep it TIGHT.
Not sure why Lamaitre and Co. Would assume that matter would be uniformly distributed.  That would be a low entropy state.  Mere gravity would dictate a lumpy universe.  In the same way that blowing up a paint can(remember the Mythbusters episode?) did not paint the walls like a spray can, but blobbed it up instead (not due to gravity, obviously, but viscosity), randomness tends to to clump naturally.
Do I see something inappropriate at 6:35? 😅
Well, so YES. I think that if you adopt the Infinite Universe Theory from Glenn Borchardt: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glenn-Borchardt/publication/325745882_Neomechanical_Gravitation_Theory/links/5b2164e7458515270fc6d703/Neomechanical-Gravitation-Theory.pdf?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19 you will easily see that gravity itself is coming from the cosmic voids! If we adopt the idea that there really is no empty space nor solid matter, we come back to the ether. If the ether microcosms are higher density away from baryonic matter, and low (aether) density around baryonic matter, we have a picture somewhat like a "Pizza Dough Ball" analogy, where the uniform flour dough is being expanded by gas bubbles: voids. Suddenly you can see how the Universe is just a giant Pizza. The high density ether particles exert a pressure on baryonic matter, resulting in "gravity". There is no force there, gravity is just the emergent property of all those aether particles pressing in on the baryonic matter. No dark energy, no dark matter, no big bang, no expansion. Just infinite matter and motion. Seems very satisfying to me! I mean, instead of all those free variables you now have just matter and motion, with the explanation being that Universe is infinite, macroscopically and microscopically, Its all just matter of various kinds: baryonic, aether particles, sub-aether particles, sub-sub-aether particles .....
What if the voids actually contain undetectable matter which generates mutually negative gravity with our matter? That model exists since the 70's, but no one is listening. #janus_model
The Big Bang model is a religious idea, the universe is eternal.
One problem with Copernicus principal is that people forget that it is an average not a set in stone law. We obviously exist in a somewhat special time and place that allows for life such as ours to exist as most of the universes history will be cold dark and incompatible with organic life so it should come as no surprise that the universe is somewhat lumpy on certain scales
Of course there's no dark matter.
Is the Hubble constant actually a constant?
At 7:54 I appreciated your restraint in not saying nice.
the universe is inside a planck relic, instead of a singularity there is a quantum sized field in black holes
So the Hubble constant might be around 69?  Nice.
Sixty Nine!  When the universe speaks it speaks!
Do you still need the expantion of space for this?  Can it be modeled?
Wow the 3d animation is on point guys! Loved the zooming down to the dirt from space.
This is the one that sounds promising.
wrr, no such thing as impx or other x thoughtx or thinkxor etc or sox notx sillyx or sillyx about x or rightx or etc, cepuxuaxj3wx, think, do, outx, can think, do, outx etc any nmw and any s perfx
I think there are two different kinds of dark energy that can’t be seen except when traveling at the speed of light when a space- time inversion occurs and everything turns inside out. Like in the movies.
Superno-“VEE”!
I would like an episode explaining why we are talking about three different matter components for neutrinos. Matter is matter, so ¿why there are three different ones?
@13:20 "global affect of gravity"? More like galactical affect of gravity!
The contents might be a bit too similar to this one to do right away, being about megastructures and the resulting validity of homogeneous matter distribution, but this has reminded me that I’m looking forward to y’all’s video about the Great Arc and Great Ring (really Great Corkscrew) 👍
@PBS Space Time   You look much more healthy today..
Didnt James Webb just find galaxies that are older than the big bang ? Thats not a problem thats a whole rewrite. The problem is that space acts differently in different areas. Therefore the ages of the universe cannot be meaausred. We have no idea how or what governs space time but it appears that space time is not the same very where.
"If you travel to the Andromeda galaxy at 99.999999999% the speed of light and back again, 100 years would have passed, but on planet Earth 5million years would have passed." -Professor Brian Cox  Due to Einsteins Theory of Relativity, everything is relative....  So what if the Universe itself or the medium in which we are travelling within the Universe beyond our current detectable range, is travelling at lightspeed, would that make time even real?
Whew! Thanks for this. I was beginning to worry that my plans for the next several billion years could get scuppered by the accelerating expansion of the universe. Now I can plan to avoid the voids and go my merry way!
ok, after having watched countless PBS Space Time episodes (and reading comment section), I finally have to ask: why do the producers think that the 'space' synth music in the background in any way enhances the presentation? I find it only distracting-- anyone else noticed the same?
Supernovae researching astronomers should focus on modelling and viceversa in order to find the error in those kind of measurments.. but as a im not an astronomer, i'd rather don't emmit an opinion 🤣  jokes apart, i could not avoid to see a similarity between those cosmic voids growing as universe matures and images of human brains a bones getting brittler as they get old
Basically, the expansion of the universe has to do with the shape of spacetime's 4D manifold?
Cosmology is on the wrong track since the 1990's imho: Ever more corrections, countercorrections and phantasy concepts keep popping up in order to consolidate the classical inflationary Big Bang Model, together with Dark Matter and Dark Energy as placeholders for badly understood underlying physics, so this journey seems to be going nowhere anymore.  After 40 years of enthusiasm about Cosmology, my interest has started to decline steadily. The Standard Model is doomed. 😕
Great video, thanks and congratulations ... This other video teaches new physics, show hidden variables to study gravity, with a rational demonstration of the non-existence of dark matter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TU-YJrMVE
6:39 Is it just me, or does that look a lot like a brain?
Shout out! https://youtu.be/WWqmccgf78w?si=VrGOJtatobM_eoTf&t=376
What if the local hole exists because it is an extreme statistical outlier, and we happen to observe ourselves inside it because it happens to strongly favor the formation of intellegent life capable of observing itself within it?
Wait...why can't it be both vacuum energy of space and the effects of voids? With one component constant and one changing as described? Might explain variation in measurements over time and perhaps over scale as well.
Long post sorry, but what does everyone think about this:    The Visible Universe (VU) we exist within was formed by a White Hole (WH). We participate WITHIN the associated expanding singularity of said WH which we currently understand as space time (ST). We have NOT YET crossed the event horizon.  When we consider that we are still within the WH and that ST is an expanding singularity, arguments against WH creation dissolve, while providing logic to other related problems…   Within a Black Hole (BH), space and time are reversed.  Within a WH, space and time exist as we currently observe them.    The VU appears to be not only expanding uniformly, but also has an edge.  Galaxies already out of view are still visible due to the time taken for their light to reach us - despite traveling faster than the speed of light away from us.  WH event horizon observation from inside the WH is valid here.  Dark Energy is also explained away (or, as per this video does exist as an actual vacuum within the singularity).  Gravity (G), however is where things really start to align.    - Gravity is not quantum, it is a consequence of other forces - You cannot quantize space time as there’s no means of measurement and the math is disastrous  - Ether theory is disproven  - Nothing is moving through space time at a quantum level when gravitational waves pass, it is a distortion of space time itself   Therefore - if space time is not an ether nor can it be quantized, what is it?   I propose that ST is the expanding WH singularity.  What we consider as nothing or “vacuum” is instead one thing, and everything that once was. It is a single item that exists throughout everything, as well as being everything and the only thing “sub-Planck”.   If everything we knew exists within “one thing”, there is suddenly a logic and sense to entanglement and its FTL information sharing capabilities.  All points in time and space are now connected. Without sounding too mystical, consciousness probably exists here too.   2nd Law Thermodynamics are often used to argue against WH creation, however a BH singularity surely reduces entropy.  I propose that at a certain critical mass, BH singularities break entropy laws therefore creating a scenario in which WH creation is mathematically acceptable.  This entropic release aligns with General Relativity Laws.   G is not a force, but a consequence of foreign matter existing within ST in the WH (aka within the WH singularity). As with biology, foreign objects are always rejected by their host.  When matter exists within the expanding singularity, ST attempts to return to the memory of itself at the point of BH entropic release.  It is a constant battle to force foreign matter out of itself which will only be achieved when all matter has passed beyond its event horizon.  Relatively, we experience this as G - which creates reasoning to why G is so much weaker than the 3 quantum forces.
Cosmic void is intuitively very good theory but the expansion rate measurment would be different every time we measure it since its affected directly ( created ) by the gravitional pull of nearby galaxies and the resultant negative pressure from it which wouldn't be the same everywhere but rather increasing vastly at some point and some others increasing by lower rate and even decreasing at some points
Wait, wouldnt that mean that all the red shift we observe is not because of the universe expanding, but the stuff on the far end getting more and more red shifted being dragged away close at the speed of light?   It would also mean since we estimate the universe being 13.8 billion something years old, the observable universe cannot be larger other than the 40 something billion years we expect now (due to space-expansion).  Sorry either I understand something fundamentally wrong, or everything we know is wrong, or that idea just doesnt add up.
Do any of these expansion papers take into account magnetism? ive always wondered why i dont see much about magnetism between galaxies being something that could cause the expansion
I clearly didn’t understand this episode. So if dark energy can be explained away, what (the heck) is driving the expansion of the universe?
This strikes me as potentially related: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpQ0T7rDWm0
“Can the crises of cosmology be solved with more vague beliefs and placeholders made of scientific ignorance?”
Could you cover the Dipole Repeller that was hypothetically discovered in 2017?
God is the original artist.
Use all our resources to find out what these massive galactic dynamos are. PLEASE forget all these exoplanets. It’s so adolescent and just plain useless. We can find out the actual mechanics of our universe if we use JWST and our newest expanse models.
Funnny, how Einstein was right, even when he thought he was wrong.
Imagine the number of atoms in your body alone, without even taking into account the atoms of the earth, the sun, the galaxy... And even given all that, the average density of the known universe is 2 atoms per cubic meter.   That is SPACE.
dr becky sucks!
Thanks for taking us through thought provoking journeys in such eloquently presented videos.
My feeble mind has exploded.
this is impossible to listen to without speeding up the playback speed...  I swear a large number of videos are published slowed down just to have more watch time.
In this cosmic bubble theory wouldn't we see a notable difference in the expansion rate of different bubbles? While in an expanding bubble everything is moving away from you, but if you look at another bubble the closer sides relative velocity to its farther side would be significant and towards you. Isn't this a simple experiment that could falsify or verify the bubble theory?
I understand that these are burning, fascinating questions, but "crisis"?
I’m perturbed that the lamda CDM estimate is so holy.  It depends on the assumption that the universe is uniform & isotopic, which is like the proverbial spherical cow.  We know the universe isn’t uniform, you’ve just discussed it.  Why not use the two expansion estimates as a measure of how non-uniform the universe is?
you really really stretched out the conclusion of the episode that we all expect when we can tell you are working your way up to saying the final words we all come here to learn about, spacetime.
What is the effect of gravity on empty space itself?  Thought experiment: a large sphere of empty space, surrounded by a homogeneous universe of sufficient density.  If you trace any geodesic that would otherwise be a chord of the sphere, shouldn’t it curve so as to exit the sphere early due to the effects of gravity?  If all geodesics curve outward (except for paths through the center) isn’t this the exact opposite geometry to a gravitational well?
“We’re clueless at this point and wildly speculating.” That’s the whole video.
I’ve been pondering this idea independently for awhile myself. I really think there is something in it.  Also in reference to your previous video about “negative mass”, I wondered if within these cosmic bubbles/voids, gravitational waves from retreating galaxies might sum to create virtual “negative mass” in its centres. Thereby expanding space further (for a while, not indefinitely).
I was right!
I love that you linked Dr Becky!  I have been following you both for years. Great to see cooperation not competition.
I just realized I don't understand why dark energy is actually necessary to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe. Namely, if mass were accelerated apart THROUGH space, then yes obviously you need energy to do that, but this is the space itself expanding. And I don't see why (a priori) I would need energy to do that, barring space itself having a net energy per unit volume, (vacuum energy) and I thought that wasn't proven (ie that's the same statement as assuming dark energy to begin with)?
If LCDM doesn't allow for such massive voids based on the CMBR measurements, but the local void is confirmed to exist nevertheless, would that issued be called "void where prohibited"?
Imo any theory that ends not in another big bang is false, just because its naive to think our universe was the first and last one. Its like saying when the sun rises, universe begins, and when it sets, universe ends. While in reality its a loop.  (ofcourse the sunrises stop eventually in my analogy, but the universe cant stop its loop, or we would not be here if it could. Its just so immensely improbable that the universe would be a one time thing)
in today's news  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV9BHDvBi-0
Everything "evolves", why would we not consider that the universe can evolve and change over time ?
Does this mean under the last model, dark energy disappears that gravity wins and it’s the heat death after all?
I've never understood why these early cosmologists all assumed it was a homogenous,  isotropic universe (4:00 in the video).  They were working at the same time  (~1915-1925) as the "Great Debate."  In this period, the disk shape of our galaxy was understood although their estimates for its size were off by a fair bit.   But, the consensus was that was that the universe was a disk.   Milky Way = Universe.   Any clear view of the night sky while the Milky Way is visible says not isotropic or homogenous.   At the time spiral nebula were believed to be similar to planetary nebula (supernova remnants) -- gas clouds within the galaxy, not distant galaxies. It wasn't until Hubble and others used the Cephieds to show that they were truly extra-galactic objects and that the Milky Way was recognized as just one of these many galaxies dispersed in all directions.   With that conventional wisdom, why did Schwarschild, Einstein,  Friedman,  Le Maitre, and so many others focus on the homogeneous,  isotropic case.   I assume it's because they had to simplify the problem enough to make it tractable. I get that ... frictionless plane,  etc.  GR is difficult.  Still, they didn't seem to just be accepting it as a compromise. They appear to be stating it as fact.  In their day,  the universe was seen as anything but homogeneous,  isotropic.  Why did no one talk about solutions in a flat disk? Done correctly, that should have also simplified the math quite a bit, eliminating one degree of freedom.   I'd love to hear if anyone had insight into this question.
I like this hypothesis a lot more than "there's a particle we haven't discovered".
Is there any evidence that constants we take for granted measured in our minuscule observational period could have been different during the age of the universe and sudden expansion and accelerated expansion?
Is it possible to calculate the total amount of energy in the universe? And is it beyond infinity?
Another view on dark energy:  I try to combine the cosmological constant and the Schrödinger solution on the Planck scale.   I used Planck units.  At the end I went back to SI units to compare with the measured vacuum energy density (0.63 10^-9 J/m^3.)  Combine:  1)     Einstein, cosmological constant 2)     Schrödinger solution (on cosmic scale?) 3)     Planck units    1)Einstein, cosmological constant  Λ = (8π 𝐺 ƐΛ)/(𝑐^4)  Planck units: G=1 c=1 Λ (6.1871424 10^34)^-2 = (8π ƐΛ [PlanckEnergy/PlanckVolume]  1.1056 10^-52 (6.1871424 10^34)^-2 = 8π ƐΛ  0.001149 10^-120 = ƐΛ  0.1149 10^-122/  ƐΛ = 1   2)Schrödinger solution, n=1  (ℎbar^2 𝑛^2 𝜋^2) / (2𝑚𝐿^2) = E  Planck units hbar=1 n=1 m= mPlanck =1 L= LPlanck=1 0.5 𝜋^2= E  1= E/0.5 𝜋^2    3)Einstein, Cosmological Constant = Schrödinger solution   0.1149 10^-122/  ƐΛ = 1 = E/0.5 𝜋^2  0.1149 10^-122  0.5 𝜋^2= ƐΛ EPlanck  EPlanck =1  0.1149 10^-122  0.5 𝜋^2= ƐΛ   0.567 10^-122 = ƐΛ  [PlanckEnergy/PlanckVolume]  0.567 10^-122    1.9561 10^9 /(1.61625502 10^-35)^3= ƐΛ  [J/m^3]  ƐΛ = 2.627 10^-9  [J/m^3]  Measured:  0.63 10^-9 [J/m^3]  I am looking forward to your response.
Isn't there far more important questions at the moment like huge questions
Is there a definable amount of "stuff" created at the start of the universe? And if it has a fixed number, kind of strange to imagine what could be so special about that number. Why the strange rules of the universe generated that specific amount of stuff/ energy at the start.
Here's a question do white holes lead to time travel??
Is the universe Expanding or are we just being able to observe for me it? Sorry for silly question. It just seems like persception plays a huge role. :S
Studying physics in the mid 80s, i came up with an idea based on questioning why we think mass causes gravity rather than the other way around. Gravity is warped space and we know warped space exist in areas without mass. Gravity waves for one. The idea us that space warps due to collisions of huge areas of energy. Where those collision reach significant percentages of SOL (speed of light), the motion has to change direction creating a 3d field of spinning energised space. Time slows and space contracts (relativity), resulting in "permanent" tiny areas of space that spins. We can only interact with specific points in those feilds, due to our own motion, whicg we refer to as "particles". Further, rather than a single universal expanding unit, there are infinite expansions (voids) that collide causing spacetime to warp causing what we refer to as mass.  Because of the characteristics of those spinning areas, they interact and form structures, atoms, elements, etc. This resolves many issues in QM and cosmology. I.e by unifying the standard model (all fundamental forces are versions of gravity), that expansion  is not universal and why mass forms. Gravity is actually relativity as applied to space itself. That's why space contracts and time dialates within gravity fields. Its what gravity actually is. Space contraction and time dilation. There's more to this, why we have leptons,  muons and quarks
What I'm wondering is whether time dilation in the presence of gravity could also have an impact on the rate of expansion: time would run slower in dense regions and faster in voids relative to us,, therefore increasing or decreasing the rate of expension as observed from Earth. At those distances, the assumption is that the effect would be negligible, but over billions of years, the cumulative effect might be detectable.
Dr. Becky-PBS Space Time collab when?
I can't speak to it's scientific validity, but I find the idea of cosmic voids eliminating dark energy entirely to be philosophically satisfying.
The crisis in cosmology comes from the fundamental  misunderstanding that the universe is electric.  The refusal of institutional astro physics to acknowledge this demands the creation of untestable, unobserved matter and energy.  The universe is a web of twisted plasma filaments (electrical currents)  this is the source of spin, it is the force that organizes the universe.  Every star is a node in a galactic circuit.  Electromagnetism  can not be seperated into magnetism without electric current.  If you see a magnetic field it must be associated with an electric current.   Learn about this and so much more at The Thunderbolt Project youtube channel.
Makes me wonder if there's an advantage to being in a void that may have helped encourage live to exist on Earth.
PBS space time with Matt (this channel) (dr.Becky), (astrum)and (SEA )Are the best astrophysics video and Becky is an astrophysicist!!
Starcraft II vibes right now
I see how the expanding bubbles can act like dark energy, but why are they(space) expanding in the first place without dark energy?
The Local Hole needs to be the name of a bar!
4:15 what if dark energy/dark matter is simply baryonic energy matter redistribution post supernovae.
This guy starts off talking and you can understand him then he descends into a very difficult to follow commentary. Very annoying and it's a shame because the content is worthy of a better effort to communicate the highlights
"cold dark matter" based on WHAT!?
7:51 nice, 69 in the local hole
Imagine space was not static, but flowing. Imagine voids are regions where space is flowing in - from wherever it came during the big bang, and flowing out through black holes. Combined with the effects of gravity you'd get a convection pattern like in a simmering fluid but in three dimensions that is very similar to the cosmic web. Imagine less space is flowing out that in and you'll get the expansion of the whole system.  Imagine space pulls the outer regions of galaxies with it as it "streams" toward the black holes. I think we do not understand space itself properly yet.
If a ball pushes a 'diaphragm' down, mustn't the diaphragm swell up around? Symmetry, to me hints that mass must equal anti-mass.  Upwellings mass slides away from, into foam edges to the bubbles.
lol are you getting your episode ideas from my online post history?
Can this be tested? Are the measurements of the cosmological constant exactly the same in all directions or have difference values if traversing many cosmic voids or many clumps of matter?
Push on the void for long, and the void starts pushing back on you.
Just theory upon theory,  no law because all it's fake
The images at 1:00 may be interpreted by science deniers that the Big Bang has been invented by a communist and a Jesuit  😆
Have any scientists ever compared these enormous cosmic structures to structures found in nature here on Earth? It might help if something similar is found here on earth. You know, like the Fibonacci sequence (spirals).
I prefer "space-bubbles" over "cosmic voids"
I'm a MattO'Dowdaphile 🌌👨‍🔬😍
7:52 nice
Finally, a way to explain outward expansion without a BELIEF in dark matter. By perceiving the vacuum of space as not having any spacetime properties and instead matter causes the existence of spacetime as a pathway to understanding why we do not find any evidence of dark energy/particles.  Think of it like stretching chewing gum where the 3D space vectors thin out and are easier to pull apart the more you stretch the gum. Mathematically could be seen as the outward pressure of void bubbles when in reality it is our limited perception of seeing XYZ axes as being constant as the problem. Is it possible that in reality, spatial vectors decay in the vacuum of space?
7:50 Nice.
Since gravity somewhat counterracts expansion, at least on the local galactic level, wouldn't voids expand faster by nature?
Lemaître= luh-meh-tr' (2 syllables)
PBS spacetime has gone downhill in recent months. The videos are scraping the bottom of the physics barrel. Bubbles and MOND?   B minus, must try harder.
I don't understand something :  - if the supercluster cause the overdense region to show a smaller value - if the supervoid cause the underdense region to show a higher value - and if we are in a supercluster but also in the middle of a supervoid => shouldn't both interact and make the measured value somewhere in the middle???
Check out the book Time Waves on the Shores of Forever. It explains this phenomenon
That makes alot of sence, i hope more research is done here
Really?  Crisis?  What would happen if a completely new concept emerged to explain how the universe operates?  Some overinflated brains would explode, but otherwise, the world would continue operating as it has forever.  Let's try and keep this in perspective.
The idea of the voids confounding our measures of the expansion has long being held by myself as a possibility, perhaps there is some confirmation bias here, but I am glad to hear others with the more knowledge than me suggesting this. I would think dark matter would also contribute to this effect. However I would think that we may be able to see a difference emerge if we can estimate the rate of expansion through a void (not our own if we are in its middle) and also through a super cluster. That is a degree of directionality. I have different lines of argument to support these ideas, however I wonder if anyone has tried to measure this difference? PS I am only an enthusiastic amateur.
Thank you for your content! If it is curious to think about the future of void bubble evaporation. Would they collapse when things begin to dissolve? What would be left in their wake? Or, how would that wake then affect the filaments/strings across its surface? Quite fascinating. I appreciate your channel for the wealth of info it provides us. Thanks again and be well!
The universe is a basin of soap bubbles. Good!
Imagine a waterbed, when you push it down in one place (matter), it bulges out in another (expanding voids).
2 shouts to Dr. Becky! <3
Dark energy is the thing you invented when your theory is wrong.
What does Graph Theory say about this?
I often fall asleep to these videos, why would you finish it with an alarm sound! I thought I had to go to work
What if the sun possessed only 1/10th of the mass we think it does?   What then?
True or not, there's something beautifully simple and elegant about this bubble model or cosmic voids.   I am also very interested in this description of the Dark energy decreasing and ultimately evaporating over the distant future of the universe. I'm curious to know how that changes the forecast for the heat death of the universe.
The key is trying to find actual physics to explain it vs some made-up  magic with no known physics.
Was it so hard to look up how Lemaitre is pronounced?
It turns out that my fascination with this channel is not completely independent of the aspergers spectrum. Just like science proves in our technological world, the more you know the more solutions you can find or learn to improve your situation. Keep going.
Me: yeah grats on 365 public videos I've playlisted all! Also me: Oh dang I missed 8 videos somewhere. Subsequently me: calculating the amount of taps it'll take me to find all 8 videos. ADHD me starts searching. Super Dad me decides to search later and get enough sleep now...
ahh, the universe: what's not there, matters ...
Is there the same amount of mass/energy in the universe as there was 13 billion years ago?
Void where prohibited by law.
I love the T-shirt graphic, but I don't like shirts with text. It would be cool if there was a version without text
does that intro and outro music have to be so damn loud?!
why not ask Stephan Hawking?
Huh?
The voids are in the center of the galaxies for fast travel
E=MC2 Energy equals mass converted twice
I was the actual Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla
I can’t help but feel that our technology lets us make observations we aren’t equipped to understand. Astronomy is amazing.
It's amazing to me too how often bubbles and foams keep appearing in physics!
5:54 - small correction, Leonardo Giani (not Giania :-). The "a" after the name is a university indicator :-)
I have a suggestion for your thumbnails: I've seen this video in my suggestions for a few days, but I didn't realize it was PBS Spacetime because the thumbnail wasn't recognizable as your channel at a glance, the "PBS" in the thumbnail is very small on a smartphone. What do you think about returning to a more reconizable thumbnail template?
If we can figure out the lumpiness of the universe, then why is it freaking impossible doing the same for making gravy?
Dibs on the band name “Cosmic Lumpiness”
Fantastic video, as always!
If the matter didn't have the "smoothness", how inflation enter in this equation?  I thought the inflation was a response to the matter be evenly spread in to the universe.
Wow. That animation depicting the voids and clusters of galaxies was beautiful! And if dark energy eventually disappears like speculated in this video, does that mean that over time gravity wins again and pulls everything in the universe back together?
Interesting as always but definitely was intrigued by the Iranian paper... since that paper made the vid, perhaps there should be a collective effort to upvote that team because they are working under some serious oppression and yet still came up with the goodness!   A few more wins for the Iranians and we'll be having the next astronomer's conference in Tehran...  but we are talking astronomers and so the alcohol forbiddance will be a problem!
Lol. "Final piece of the puzzle".
Thank you guys for another excellent video on the current research. The fact that we're even able to grapple with scales this large with reasonable plausibility is astounding. It's so hard to know things with certainty at such scales though too. Extraordinary stuff.  God be with you out there everybody. ✝️ :)
Is this a solution to the Fermi Paradox?.  Any sufficiently advanced civilization will recognize that the "big rip" doom awaits anyone that is imprisoned in a void, and the only thing to do it try to escape to the edge.
7:52 nice
If the void hypothesis is correct in explaining dark energy, are there implications for the ultimate fate of the universe? Would we still necessarily expect the universe to end with heat death?
Thanks, Dr Becky!
That’s a fascinating hypothesis. I hope JWST and friends can log some helpful data to prove or disprove the notion.
So, the Universe is acting like Spray foam. It has a finite amount of material, just like spray foam, so it might just slow down eventually. Those animations look just like what spray foam does too. Like an analog.   Weird to hear that the voids haven't really been thought about as being important that much.
here's my solution to the Fermi paradox we're so far out in the sticks aliens can metaphorically hear Banjo music and drive right by.
Trumpers say it is all caused by cow farts.
its funny i had a theory that i was tellin my friend about that is pretty much this about a week ago and he was telling me im dumb and wrong so i googled it and im like oh i guess they actually have the same idea and are currently testing it out. cant wait to through this video in his face lmao.
fyi You can verify me ranting that this was the solution is several prior posts. I even mention the tension characteristic of space. Not claiming credit, just lottery luck. ~ If you see the Iranians, please tell them they have a peasant fan.
H0=69 nice
There is a crisis in Cosmology??? My God, why didn't anyone tell me?!
if an observer were 4+ [universe lengths] away from the universe (paradox I know) - would they see a ball of light? now, 13billion ago?
So is it possible that said voids are formed by some kind of particles which exibit opposite gravitational effects to regular matter - i.e. space is curved outwards from such kind of particles? I would imagine theoretical "white hole" big enough would have similar effect and create reverse lensing effect on light travelling through neighbour area.
Well, the cosmic voids' negative pressure hypothesis seems to me much more attractive (pun intended) than the horrific MOND (a Monstrosity based ONly on the egos of some frustrated and Delusional people trying to show themselves better than Newton and Einstein).
A very interesting theory, totally new to me. I don't quite understand it, I'll try to think about it. Are we to understand that this theory implies proposes a mechanism for something pulling galaxies (that we can see) away from each other from the outside and not a force pushing them appart from between galaxies? Maybe I haven't followed a thing. I just love the idea of bubbles being able to explain the mysteries of the Universe.
Hang on - my understanding (being superficial) is that "lumpiness", mathematically and statistically indicates randomness....
So you saying we all live in a local hole😢
...😂 it's impossible for him to talk without constantly waving the hands.
Voids. Ugh...
Aliens warped into a void and dropped DNA off on a planet that no one would ever find or mess with and that's why we're here and see nobody
Really Neat!
*nods profusely* sixty-nine
If these Voids "are" Dark Energy, (and thus dark energy will go up and then down), what does this mean for the predicted end of the universe? Is it still Heat Death, as by that point most matter is already too far apart to ever join back, or are we going to end up with a Big Crunch as, far in the future, expansion drops off entirely and gravity wins again?
So, in other words, dark energy  avoids explanation.
lumpy space is a strange place
COULD ? is not science. Mathimatical Word Salad.
And can't we look at galaxies beyond the Local Hole? After all, we have seen galaxies over 10 billion light-years away from us.
Please make a long video about voids and dark matter. Those animations of the filaments are really and eye opener.
The scientists that assume that dark energy is due to the (super-)voids as part of the cosmic web structure are closer to truth (though they still mistakenly assume the existence of space expansion), but it's not quite it. The mechanism that creates the dark energy phenomenon is the cosmic web itself; it puts up an internal (positive) pressure between galaxies, and its architecture determines the directional expansion rates and growth of voids. In its filaments (namely as vast particle rivers going in both directions simultaneously, unhindered in overlapped super-position), galactic amounts of relativistic neutrinos are exchanged between galaxies, washing through and around the galaxies, and they apply an extended swing-by on them which pulls on them, but more importantly, a fraction of these relativistic neutrino (i.e. dark matter) particle rivers gets permanently hung up around stellar black holes of galaxies and their super-massive black holes, and by conservation of momentum pull on the black holes which by their gravity then pull on nearby stars. With this hypothesis, one can then explain several qualitatively different observations such as why spiral galaxies embedded in such filaments tend to be tilted towards them rather than orthogonal to them (due to an imbalance of stellar black hole distribution throughout their discs, and so over billions of years, the pressure exerted on the sides of the disc isn't equal), and since this mechanism's strength should significantly be determined by how many (pressure exerting) hot neutrinos are produced in the universe at a given age and how many and how large of black holes are existing (as the near sole neutrino wind shields capable of being subjected to the pressure unlike stars), this dynamical dark energy mechanism can explain the shape or the (inflation obsoleting) entire curve describing the expansion rate of the universe, namely with population III stars causing steep acceleration with their rapidly formed future super-massive black holes, then a flattening due to the end of the population III stars era and hence a delay - namely after millions, then billions of years until more and more normal stars collapse - in further black hole creation which leads to the final mild 2nd acceleration.
Please learn how to pronounce Lemaître.
Has entropy really been studied on the largest of scales? The void theory sounds plausible. Combined with entropy always increasing it could explain dark matter. Does not explain the light bending around these voids. Maybe the entire void is acting like a giant lens. Effectively a lens is difference in refractivity which loosely corresponds to density of the medium.
"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted." (Hebrews 2:14-18)  When my lifework is ended and I cross the swelling tide, When the bright and glorious morning I shall see, I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side, And His smile will be the first to welcome me. I shall know Him, I shall know Him. And redeemed by His side I shall stand, I shall know Him, I shall know Him By the print of the nails in His hand.
I have a theory that our Universe is one split into two halves separated by a surface or boundary layer. On one side all that exists is the quantum field(s), and the other our 4D spacetime consisting of matter and vacuum where time is not necessarily a dimension but caused by the fact that all matter is in motion. Random quantum field fluctuations fill the voids between galaxies causing an "antigravitational" effect and act very similar to the "void bubbles" discussed in the video. The "surface" or as an analogy the fabric of spacetime has the surface tension causing the expansion of the universe. This theory also would describe that at the boundaries at the edges of galaxies matter "precipitates" from the random fluctuations of the quantum field(s) that fill these bubbles. It is at this point that the superposition of particles of matter with their quantum counterparts happens these particles begin to clump together under the gravitational pull of the matter within the galaxy and the "antigravitational" push of the void. The interplay between the "antigravitational" push of the void and gravitational pull of matter and SMBH's at the center of galaxies creates a semi homeostatic equilibrium wherein matter can continue to exist and evolve and clump creating stars and other large bodies of matter. This is in contrast to the space within the void where the "antigravitational" push would cause even the heaviest of atoms to to be ripped apart. This theory would also explain observations made by JWST of very distant early galaxies in the following way. Cosmic inflation after the big bang was caused by the massive energy in the quantum field(s) after the big bang giving rise to great relative fluctuations of the "surface" or like I think of it as the "Universal Medium". These relatively large fluctuations gave rise to a multitude of singularities which provided the "gravitational gradient" required for matter to "precipitate" from the quantum field(s) into 4D spacetime. Because of the large gradient over a small amount of space the matter was immediately consumed by the black hole formed around the singularities but not before antiparticles were ejected. These antiparticles carried the information needed for new matter forming to clump into atoms first of H. This process would continue and as it did the gradient between the "antigravitational push" of the voids and the pull of the black holes created an ever growing region of "smooth" space between the voids and the black holes. It is in this region where the first stars are created in very quick succession before almost immediately being consumed by the black holes each one once consumed emitting antiparticles hawking radiation and gravitational waves. This would continue until the first supernovae begin to happen when the lifetime of the stars crossed a threshold where they survived long enough before being consumed to go supernova. This would happen at an accelerated rate to which we would perceived now due to the fact that the gradient was still quite large and condensed. This would continue with more of the periodic table first coming to exist in the aftermath of these early supernovae which once consumed would provide the information in antiparticles expelled from the event horizon along with Hawking radiation to allow matter to begin to condense into those atoms once again at the boundary at the edge of these infant galaxies. This cycle could explain the observations of early galaxies being far brighter and more dense that previously expected as what JWST is observing are these galaxies in their infancy seething with an ever growing number of massive supernovae. As galaxies continue to grow and the region surrounding their SMBHs continues to expand the lifetime of matter and stars begin to take the shape of galaxies observed more close to home which are more similar in age. This theory would have gravity being classical and not quantum and a completely fundamental to the nature of the universe. I believe this theory would align quite well with theories such as Orch OR. I think the theory leads to the conception of a spherical universe with great undulations on its surface spanning hundreds of thousands to hundreds of billions of light years. The true shape being hidden due to our position in the universe in a relatively flat equilibrium state where the surface has been made flat due to the stretching of the "Universal medium". I see galaxies being similar in nature to that of the coin donation funnels found in shopping malls where the voids create high potential and singularities/BHs create low potential.  I have further thoughts on the implications to quantum mechanics and particle physics specifically the mystery surrounding the collapse of the wave function, but that's for another time if my theory isn't shot down completely. I am not a trained theoretical physicist nor do I have the training in mathematics to even begin to put the mathematical legs of the theory together. I just wanted to get some of these ideas off my chest. Thank you.
1:50  I love hearing how even one of Einstein's 'blunders' is worthy of a Nobel Prize.
I really dug this video. They say that science starts wtih a desire for elegance and this suits me far more than the other 'dark energy' theories I've heard.
Modern cosmology has a crisis because the universe is a dream that scientists are erroneously interpreting as reality. What looks like expansion is increasingly abstract information being received from cosmological concepts. Forms seem farther away when we are receiving less detailed information from them.
his name is "lö mätre"
Excellent theory on cosmic void in terms with dark energy 👌🏻👌🏻🙌🏻
So, does this change the often stated contention that on large enough scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic?
So MUCH Hubble tension.  Cosmic Microwave Background and Cosmic Distance Ladder should just get a private room already.😍
I am always amazed when cosmologists and physicists talk about scale and justify isotropic nature. Never seemed a rational assumption to me.  How those small cmb fluctuations resulted in uneven distribution can possibly be solved,  modelled
7:51 Nice.
Do you ever get existential dread thinking about these topics? Such large scales making human existence so insignificant. I can't help but feel nauseous sometimes...
I just get so excited when I know Matt's wrapping up and he's about to say SPACETIME but he did a pump fake on me this time and it threw me off, he wasnt quite done. Brilliant stuff Matt. Keeping us on our toes
🤔So...into how many spatial dimensions is the universe expanding, exactly?
What if, at some point, space boubles start being too big or give out too much "pressure" or something and start "bursting". Will space fold in on it self and eventually create a new big bang when all the space bubles "burst"?  Or are those non-space boubles? What does this mean for gravity?
Since spacetime is one thing, if space expands, how do we know that time is also not expanding or contracting?
love your content, keep it up
A *Hubble value* of *69* in the *Local hole* is causing *Hubble tension*   Come on, how can anyone keep a straight face while saying this? 😂😂😂
6:50 Vishnu with his legs crossed. The Milky Way is the bearing heart in his chest.❤
Happy 2024 PBS Space Time, Science is always interesting
You frequently use the phrase "solved the einstein equations for..." What did that entail, exactly. Does this mean plugging in specific variables? Does this mean combining parts of the equations with other problems going on? Are there certain hurdles that had to he overcome for the equations to give a certain answer to a certain equation?
I desperately want to study astronomy and astrophysics in particular, but those programs aren't available where I live. They don't have anything astronomy related at my local community college, and I can't afford university. Can anyone point me in a direction that could help me get a job or find a way into school for this? Any advice?
The universe being foam on a large scale feels so elegant for some reason
From now on, the Milky Way galaxy will, in my mind, be exclusively referred to as the "local lump". Thanks Matt!
As always, the devil is in the details. I love this channel
All of this is starting to feel like the "climage change" of cosmology, in the sense that many seem more inclined to make the theories satisfy their bias rather than explore that somewhere along the way mistakes or wrong assumptions were made.
5:53 I cannot believe Matt would make this mistake, so I surmise that someone is preparing the script for him, and that someone is not acquainted with reading technical papers. The name is "Giani", the final 'a' being a footnote. No, I'm not being wise-ass! 🥸
so the universe is expanding faster today than it was 13 billion years ago; so why the fuss that observations tell us exactly that?
Wow! That was a good one! The animations were awesome. I love hearing about the latest theories!
My limited understanding of physics tells me that the presence or absence of matter affects the flow of time. Considering cosmic voids on average contain a tenth of the matter outside of the voids it seems to me that while it's unlikely to be the primary driver it is certainly a contributing factor to the expansion of the universe having time flow faster inside the voids which are expanding.
Imagine the universe going through a cosmic scale phase change? There's no evidence for it but there's no evidence against it either as our assumptions and equations break down when we probe those questions.
I think dark matter is repelled by typical matter while still attracted to itself (negative mass "dark fluid"), so I think it would form these huge bubbles of what appear to be voids. On a smaller scale I think that would solve the galaxy rotation curve problem, meaning dark matter isn't glue holding galaxies together when they should be flying apart, but more of an outside force pushing in / serving as a container
I love the bubble analogy for dark energy! It already sounds like a fun fact in some future textbook.
So how do you account for the time distortion between nearby and far away objects? What is several billion LYs away is no longer where we see it. Does there exist a model that shows where those objects are expected to be no? Nope, because we cannot calculate that n-body-problem.
All you need is more cgi pictures and pseudoscience my guy. 🙃
I figured out that buble thing pushing everything apart few years back, when I was really high, but couldnt form it into smart sounding words, finally some iranians did it.
Just allow for electricity in space and all the crisis will be over, but they wont do that because truth is not the goal of those in control.
These cosmic void bubbles could easily speed up expansion over time too. Like how the top of a chain quickly pulls the rest of the links off a table, the more that gets pulled the faster it goes.
Dark Energy ended up being a red herring just like string theory. At least that's one problem solved.
Abandon the ideas of Ed Witten, Brian Greene and Michio Kaku, you’ll be onto a great start.
7:52  nice
Questions/Video Topic Idea:  _ What if humans simply do not possess the brainpower to understand the true nature of the universe.  You cannot explain calculus to a cat. The human intelllect in this case is the cat and the nature and workings of the universe is calculus. _  AI Response:  _* If humans simply do not possess the brainpower to understand the true nature of the universe, it would mean that there are limitations to our cognitive abilities. This could be a humbling realization, as it would suggest that there are aspects of reality that are beyond our comprehension.  However, it could also lead to a greater appreciation for the mysteries of the universe and a recognition of the limits of human knowledge. It might inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity about the unknown, leading to a continued pursuit of understanding and exploration.  In this scenario, it would be important for humans to approach the universe with humility and open-mindedness, recognizing that there is much that we do not know and may never fully understand. It could also lead to a greater emphasis on collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches to unraveling the mysteries of the universe, as different perspectives and expertise may be needed to piece together a more complete understanding.  Ultimately, the recognition of our limitations in understanding the true nature of the universe could lead to a shift in perspective and a deeper respect for the complexity and vastness of the cosmos. *_
Questions??
NO but to admit they where wrong and start from scratch  !!!  if you take the integral of Newtons free fall you get E=mc² !!!!
69 DUDE !
Thanks, Matt.
This guy is lying through his teeth all day long.
Well I took one look at Bootes supervoid with its spherical shape and saw an object of the Superverse..... then came the Big Bang Kilonova Hypothesis
Time split experiment
Could you do an episode on Sciama's work on gravity, please?
So basically, matter tends to clump up due to gravity. This creates void pockets, which expand as the matter clumps up more and more.   Shouldn't this be common sense?
Happy new year to all the team
Your mum's the Local Hole
As long as nothing voids the results, I guess.
Congratulations on 3mils🎉
Wow my mind was just blown away by that theory. This could explain a lot. Those animations were great too.
Whatever you do, do NOT talk to it.  Even if you die
The study of the absence of things is so fascinating.
Hubble Constant 69 sounds like a nick from an early Darpa days ;)
But why does my anthropic bias prone mind see a brain? Wack.
Very good as always 😊...
There's a 3rd possibility, it's not a constant.
nice
Dark energy is equal to zero degrees Kelvin, let's get started with that.
2:02 ¹•__
Lambda-CDM - the amazing theory that relates the expansion pressure from Dark Energy (that we can’t even really posit what it is, yet alone detect it) to Dark Matter (that we also can’t posit or detect)…
I get confused at that scale of distance. 6:35 isn't it far in the past? I mean that kind of cosmic void can't be a construction in time rather in space? Or it isn't affect the conclusion?
I'm of the opinion that with something relatively early on we assumed a wrong explanation that accurately described the phenomena we saw at the time, and the crisis in cosmology is because of that error- but since it's so early and fundamental, nobody noticed since it might require a full on paradigm shift.
iThink uGot it & Possibly, could (2D)-string theory actually be (3D)-bubble theory?
Still think dark energy, dark matter, black holes, and the Big Bang are all connected through the same piece of physics we don't understand.   I think we are wrong about some things because we don't have that piece of physics figured out.
1:38 the discovery of dark energy?
👍👍👍
Nice.
I would honestly love for a flat earther to watch this and try to debunk it using their explanation of density
This video is from 11 hours ago.
Lol.. local hole
Stating that dark energy has been 'discovered' is akin to saying before 2012 that the Higgs Boson was also already 'discovered' ....
If that is the case, does it mean we do not have a cosmic horizon? Because space itself is not expanding. its just matter forming a bubble and the bubble is expanding which cannot cross the speed of light.
Okay but why is MOND even being considered here? Aren't the physics of local gravity overcoming dark energy at the threshold of those two forces already perfectly explained by ΛCDM? I remain confused.
Dr. Becky fan are you Matt? ;)
All the best wishes for a New Year for PBS Space Time Team! :D
For an intuitive explanation for why dark energy produces an expanding push: dark energy means vacuum has energy, and expansion of the universe produces more vacuum. Just like a rock "pushes" against your hand because it "wants" to gain kinetic energy (by falling down), vacuum pushes for expansion because it "wants" to gain more vacuum energy.
IMHO Universe is folding in itself. Hence (as mentioned) dark energy will decrease (with time). it will also explain the acceleration, as well as the red shift.
This void bubbles seem to be a very good explanation, it feels right to apply Ockham’s razor to dark energy; it’s not called “dark” because it feels natural.
Spicetoime
Maybe the universe is is expanding faster than expected because your mom isn't as heavy as earlier sources claimed.
Can you please make a video about the higgs mass heirachy problem
Maybe expansion of the universe is simply dynamic and sometimes it slows down and then accelarates again. Maybe in the past it was even contratcing and expanding rapidly which would explain the origins of size of an early galaxies.
Any plans to collab with dr. Becky?
> thing called “local hole” > its boundaries are literal billions of light years away from us
@1:50 - my physics professor told us about how Einstein considered adding a fudge factor to make his equations work his greatest mistake in his career and quipped "Even when Einstein was wrong, he is right".
This is more align with what I would think, occam's razor would say that gravity of space bubble tension is easier to explain then a made up force of dark energy that magically expands space
The new study is correct. Dark energy will fade as the gravity settles all the matter back to the original source and some of the material that is moving away too fast won’t come back as it’s not bound by gravity.
Explain how "dark energy" can repulse galaxies, galaxy clusters, super galaxy clusters and walls without radiating heat or light or any other fornicating observable processes. Whatever it is, if it's anything at all and not just inaccurate observations, it is NOT energy. Frankly what you profess to describe is better designated as "magic". Dark energy/anti-gravity contradicts everything. You have not one teeny tiny insignificant clue as to how the magic either macroly or quantumly, operates. Admit it cosmologists or should I designate you as cosmetologists, because neither of you knows how "dark energy", if it even exists, works.
That animation at 11:40 is so amazing. Just the idea of cosmic bubbles breaks my mind.
I think expansion is relative to the observer.
This is a very interesting hypothesis, and as someone over 50, I hope I live to see the crisis in cosmology resolved... and the Riemann Hypothesis proven. 🙂
The last paper naturally points to 4D fluid subspace or hyperfluid, the surface tension on which we experience as our universe.  With that, you get the effect of the Big Bang with the inflation period with low entropy if you assume that there is a preexisting 4D fluid bulk that experiences a super large disturbance to its surface, basically a big splash.  If the bulk fluid has a preexisting flow to it, then you get the dark energy and dark flow.  You also get the dark matter effect from the material properties of the fluid itself which is slightly non Newtonian.  The flow in this hyper fluid river would cause micro eddies that we experience as galaxies and the flows of Lanakeia are undercurrents.  I know this is really reaching but it works out if you let go of the constraints of size and duration and just apply what we already know about fluid dynamics but at cosmic scales.
This is hard to explain. Space itself has a default size of Planck's size ( lack of a number it close enough) Space itself pushes or always tries to get back collapse to this default. When space is at this default size no matter what, no movement, so no heat, it is like a supper conductor, energy itself used to fuel this collapse. Matter as we know it, is pushing out against this collapsing space. So our sun (a star) isn't pulling causing space to be smaller around it because of gravity, space itself is causing this gravity to form that pushes out against space because it collects all the matter back into pure energy which it can use to enlarge itself. ( I'm explaining this so poorly)   Physical gotten things backward it started over 100 years ago with, a photon (aka light) this mass particle (it only a particle IT CAN NOT BE A WAVE) gravity is the wave, when a photon is created a gravity wave is made due to change in mass that created said photon, which push out against space itself. Space itself isn't affected by photons, but it the gravitational wave causes the problem.  Someday, point ill try to write a complete paper starting with how a Photon is only a particle , hopefully, it help correct these error we made 100 years ago.
That bubble idea is actually genious.
Hang on, a universe where Dark energy is the result of surface tension of cosmic bubbles that starts off getting stronger and eventually weakens and evaporates is a universe where gravity forces the expansion to slow and eventually reverse leading to the dreaded Big Crunch, the earliest the Universe can end.
No one "discovered" dark energy if you just made it up to explain something.
I swear, I’ve imagined using the voids for this sort of explanation before, but had no way of articulating it, nor anyone that would understand to listen lol 😂 😭
The problem with cosmology is that it does not recognize the effect of electric energy in the universe. It follows outmoded notions dreamed up by Einstein. Modern cosmology is mere fantasy.
Gravity causes time dilation, so how much faster does time passes in the bigger emptier voids?
The Ai voice is terrible
At 11:40, the clumping together of the universe looks almost like grain growth of a material. Anyone know both of these maths? Are they similar?
Awesome vid!!
We are little worms with an obscure and tiny perspective of a thing that the human mind cannot, in its entirety, grasp. Plato's cave bigtime...
What a fascinating notion!
Again, our Universe is inside a "mother universe". The results are the pulling/expansion of our universe by the mother universe. Quantum particles that pop into and out of existence pass through to the mother universe and back again. Dark Matter or Energy is what we call it this universe. It is a higher dimension space.
Can you say "Inhomogenous Cosmology"? Describing the universe using a tinker toy model may not be answer.
Le Sage was right kinda!
Those Iranian scientists have a really interesting idea, I would love to learn more about them
Gotta love parsimonious explanations and theories
I’m down with cosmic lumpiness
Cosmologists learned their lesson well a century ago. "Hey, if we come across something that we have no idea what it is again, for heaven's sake, don't name it "luminiferous". Hence, we have the "dark" thingamabob. When this is proven nonexistant, the only name they can choose for the next pink elephant will be the "gray" thingamabob.  Assuming they don't call it the "pink" thingamabob.
Can you lower the volume on the outro? I love listening to these before bed and the outro always gives me a jump scare. 🤞🤞🤞
RemindMe! in Infinite years (and space) to see if this turned out to be true.
Can i ask an unintelligent question? Do these voids actually contain less matter? If so, would time be progressing faster relative to matter dense regions? Would that also alter the speed of expanding space in "voids?" Or is there enough gass and matter there to make such a difference like that negligible? Just spitting ignorant 🔥...
The earth is down by the galactic river
Hubble Constant being 69 would be pretty nice
1:08 recession of the galaxies? I think you Wordoed that one. AKA typoed but with speaking. Shouldnt it be Expansion not Recession? as those words mean opposite of each other.
Thank you so much for this channel. I wouldn't even hazard a guess out how much of this I actually understand. But, you still don't seem to dumb things down. Perfect!
It’s obvious, the FAA, like much of the federal administrative apparatus in this country is captured by the industries they are tasked to regulate also underfunded.
What I don't get is why the universe can’t be infinite, like why couldn’t there be multiple big bangs infinitely across space spread infinitely apart, with universes expanding infinitely.
So if space has energy then it must have mass. Where do that fit into the equations?
The great attractors pull apart space causing new space to be created between them.
Fingers crossed 🤞that the Hubble Constant is truly a number which, when rounded to an integer, is 69.
Isn't gravity a negative pressure? And wouldn't voids be a positive pressure (from lack of gravity)? Why do I feel like I have this backwards?
Nicely wrapped up with the signature "Space Time" ending
Amazing video
Matt has gotten lost inside your local hole due to its massive size, and will resume comment responses once/if he escapes.   - Spacetime Staff
Ok, that "surface tension" theory is cool as heck. And all you need is gravity to describe it which is cool... because we already have the math to solve for it. Very elegant!
For the last 35y at least we have tried to disprove Einstein again and again with no success. Now you are  going after Friedman and Lemaitre. Instead of writing a paper stating it is possible that they were wrong, we should focus on science...better telescopes, better particle accelerators, better experiments. I think its clear by now that thinking about the universe and then writing theories down will not improve science.. the last guy who did it was Einstein about 125y ago but the Earth's population is 10x higher since then.
I wish that awful picture of Einstein with his tongue out had never been taken.   (Yes, I know it was his own idea, but it was a bad one.)    The least anyone who respects the man can do is use a better image of him.
I’m so curious what the long term consequences of dark energy diminishing to zero over time. Would that happen before the predicted escape of every other galaxy over the cosmic horizon? And if so, would those galaxies now gravitationally attract each other and form one super galaxy?
*shakes fist* MOND?!!!!
How can you have an expansion of space without it having mass?
Like I always said, it is a foam. An inflating foam
Oooooo, no dark energy! Gotta say I'm rootin for it. There's just a little part of my heart that says "mmm, yes please!" to the idea of explanations that doesn't require extra unknowns.
It can't be easy to create a map considering you're also looking further back in time. It's interesting that dark energy might simply not be needed as telescopes and distance measurements get more precise.
🤫 One day in the distance future all those clusters are going to form 6 or 7 super, mega, gigantic, enormous, huge galaxies. Then, the void will be in a different place. 🫢 IBM♟️Black Project Department ✌️
"It's not silly to wonder about this stuff" should be the physicist's mantra.
As per usual, with PBS, we can use Betteridge's Law of Headlines to answer the question posed in the title: "NO!" Thanks for preventing me from wasting 15 minutes of my life, PBS! You guys are awesome the way you adhere strictly to Betteridge's Law! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines
"S I X T Y - N I N E ,   D U D E S !!! " {/billandted} You just know Matt included that to try to get the comments filled with "NICE!"
I have a problem with scientists trying to adapt the facts to fit the common theories, instead of admitting the acknowledged theories are incorrect.  The only thing we have ever proven, is that everything we thought was understood correctly, was not. The search continues.
What if the observable universe is itself in a cosmic void and the expansion we're seeing is the effect of the matter we can observe being absorbed by a super structure that we cannot observe.
Whether or not this specific hypothesis turns out to be accurate, the idea of unpredictable emergent phenomena showing up in seas of complexity is accepted by virtually 100% of people as true and inevitable. We see it in literally every kind of complex system across all disciplines.  So for physicists to treat the literal entire universe as just a homogeneous system somehow immune to these emergent phenomena is not only inaccurate, it’s totally ridiculous. There is a 100% chance that among the chaos and complexity of the universe, systems and dynamics have emerged that have a significant macroscopic effect on the overall structure and behavior that must be considered. And (imo) it is also quite possible that we are just too small to see beyond what could be the “local” dynamics of a massive complex system, the emergence of which would be impossible to predict from just the laws of physics
I can't believe we've been the ones living in Lumpy Space this whole time
both measurements are correct and the problem is with the GR model. The equivalence principle of acceleration and gravity is clearly false.
As a science daydreamer I always wondered about the baselines of Time and Space in a region devoid of galaxies and the clusters. I thought it must be fascinating how the Universe acts when its empty of everything apart from light and neutrinos.
Damn. Dr. Becky was so close to a hat trick. Better luck next time.
I study structural biology, and from learning biophysics, I really saw that just basic interactions between basic molecules can cause magical-seeming phenomena. However, we know that in the scale of biology, there's no magic and everything can be simulated by wavefunctions if one has enough computing power. In my field, if you ask why things are behaving strangely, I would say something like the water is a quantum identity that has complex behaviors, not protein dynamics needs a fudge factor or two. For the universe, I never liked those fudge factors like dark energy and dark matter - it's like saying our equations have accounted for everything but one, which is kind of insane considering the complexity of large systems.
Love this video. This theory feels like something. We've all had the sense of hearing something and it feels substantive. That is what this is. Dark energy, dark matter, multiverse, etc. They all feel like artifacts in equations simply to make them work until we know what is really going on. They have never felt like a glimpse at reality.
When entropy gets to 1.0 then matter will be smooth. We ain't there yet ;)
"JWebb Pictures Are Instant"...Maybe slightly delayed...Like 87 Supernova Light..Or "Gravitational Lensing"..Otherwise you are talking "Fairy Tale Universe"..Where The Universe could have all blown up 1 Million Years Ago..."Now We Are Watching The Casper The Friendly Ghost Show"...The Circuit Board of The Universe is E.P.R. Instant..The instant observation  medium that enables 2 particles to communicate @ great distances..We live in a "North Pole Instant Neutrino Ground Wire Universe"...87 Supernova = "Instant Ground Wire Detected Jolt"..(It was actually a simple hack)..Eve knew Bob was sending Alice a light message...Before Alice got to see it...Take Care...Bye..
Its all just bs, just made up rubbish, us here self aware the universe seeing itself thinking we can measure something we are a part of? Nonsense.
Did you mean we are in the center of the void or?
I want to know what the Great Attractor of Laniakea is
Wow that's very compelling on an intuitive level. The surface tension/negative pressure bit.
While it may still just be a developing hunch, I do appreciate the thought of modeling the universe sort of as a giant bubble bath. I wonder if all of the super clusters meet to form common angles across space as do bubbles on the micro scale on Earth?
Adding “cosmic lumpiness” to my galactic lexicon ❤
Its long past time that we throw out Lamda, we have know for a decade already that the accelerting expansion measurements themselves disapear when you look at different parts of the sky, which is stone cold proof that they were nothing more then local voids.  It's shamefull that such nonsense was allowed to even become orthodox without being verified across the whole sky first.
Impressive, every episode uncovers more ideas, more concepts.  Exciting times deciding the nature of REALITY. :)
Now your talking. I've always felt something was being overlooked - like empty space
Wow, the Laniakea supercluster at depicted at 6:30 reminds me of the human brain's limbic system. (FWIW, I was trained in that stuff once upon a time).
Yeah... the assumption of homogeneity of the universe has struck me as one of the dumbest ideas we've yet to relinquish. I'm not even a little surprised each time something comes along to challenge that assumption.
Sorry to be pointy about just that detail: Lemaître is pronounced "luh-meh-trr", fast. At least, it's the best approximation I can think of.
7:50 Nice
my idea
The biggest clue was JWST locating the cosmic plastic bubble blower.
The reason there are some unusual voids exist because some Type-3 civilizations become introverts & fed up & live peacefully by building huge dyson spheres😂
It would seem that whenever one finds discrepancies, that should be a clue that something is fishy.  As you mentioned, there are a lot of assumptions, estimates and simplifications used to explain what we observe. GIGO suggests that perhaps it is these logic chains could be the cause of all the trouble.  I am reminded of the problem of tolerance stacking from an engineering perspective; it is surprisingly easy to see near chaotic divergence from what's expected.
Amazing video
As I understand it time flows at different rates inside and outside of gravitational wells. Could this difference in the rate of time flow at different points in the universe have an effect on the calculations required for an expansion rate?
Trying to wrap my head around cosmic surface tension… 🧐
Matt and Dr. Becky😂
How can these sorts of questions hope to be answered without knowledge of what, if anything lies beyond the cosmic horizon?
I think it's important to always remember that the further out we look, the further into the past what we're seeing is. the actual structure of our local supercluster is probably unknowable, because we're seeing where the galaxies used to be, not where they are "now." It's useful information for most physics, sure, but it's hard to see how useful it can be to truly understand the local structure around us. Are the voids really there or are they an illusion caused by the distance the light has traveled to get to us and by our current limited perspective? 🤷
I think there  is pretty powerful consequences from the No big crunch theorem which shows the strong limitations of Friedmann Lemaître  Robertson Walker cosmology namely the incompatibility of any approximate FLRW universe with the supposed "cosmological principal as a means to "approximate" away distant objects which have ever been able to causally interact to any degree away as being "negligible". Namely this breaks the principal of uniqueness which solutions to systems of differential equations have particularly for those which are multivariate systems of partial differential equations.   It can and has been shown that for any sufficiently large universe the rate of change in volume can not ever change signs because there does not exist any nontrivial logically valid solution to the Einstein field equations which supports such a solution the consequence is that if the solutions are to be eternally self consistent and  information on the initial conditions is to be preserved, an important axiom we  must relax the forced symmetry constraint on the metric since the no big crunch theorem allows us to derive that any such constraint is invalid. In essence in the 2016 paper where this theorem was derived the authors showed the conditions which must be met simultaneously for any nontrivial metric with nonzero asymmetry or inhomogeneity can never be met without requiring two mutually incompatible conditions on the metric to both be simultaneously true. This means any initially expanding universe must always expand forever and vice versa for any initially contracting universe the sign of the rate of change in volume is eternally fixed however presents a problem in the context of information as    If we want to avoid this problem then the only way that such a condition can hold for a solution in the Einstein field equations to be valid in general for any and all possible initial conditions is for the metric to have irreducible nonzero asymmetry.  The implication from the perspective of an expanding light cone in an expanding universe is that the interaction between any two sources which have ever interacted must be nonzero because if inhomogeneous and anisotropic solutions are run the effect of the curvature of space on the rate which time passes for any expanding region of spacetime is dependent on the local time coordinate of that region.  Thus you can never drop more simplify a term away completely because there must be a nonzero minimum contribution representing those past interactions encoded into the metric else you are no longer solving the same differential equation.  This one tiny change of setting a nonzero minimum directionally dependent contribution of gravity between any two bodies naturally solves the observations attributed to "dark energy" without requiring any components be added to the Einstein field equations i.e. we can remove lambda entirely and get the same result as the observed acceleration is present with or without lambda which avoids the discrepancies in measured strength of vacuum energy that a cosmological constant would add but it also allows you to through limit analysis naturally derive MOND like behavior of gravity as a consequence of there now being a nonzero minimum contribution to gravity which will at some given distance dependent on the initial size and matter density of the universe and the mass of the galaxy and or galaxy cluster system you are looking at.  So we can in principal eliminate all these mysterious dark variables just by making sure the Einstein field equations now always obey the mathematical rules of differential systems (calculus) for all possible choices of initial conditions.  Observations looking to test the cosmological principal through a cosmological dipole test have shown that the existence of any such frame at which the universe can be simplified to be approximately consistent with FLRW cosmology has been ruled out to the degree that for the current observations to be consistent with a so called cosmological standard of rest existing would require our data to be erroneous to the degree of being a more than 1 and 2 million odds of a statistical fluke. In essence the best fit for our data and theory i.e. the unconstrained/"simplified" and irreducibly nonlinear Einstein field equations is that the Einstein field equations were exactly correct other than the assumption that the gravitational influence of a body can ever approach zero in the limit r goes to infinity.  I know this is a disappointing revelation as this means that no linearizable and valid nontrivial solutions to the Einstein field equations applicable to an actual universe exist but since isn't  about what we want but rather what best fits the observations and from Occam's razor as a principal the solution with the least added components is usually the best one.
Cosmology is happily making a geological turn, attending more to the actual contingent structure of our universe and moving away from early 20th century modeling that assumed explicitly smoothness, uniformity, “fixed stars”, and pure physics in imaginary metric spaces.
I speculated on this in a comment on an earlier episode of Space Time, calling for the observation across a void in comparison to along a cluster. But I didn't know we were smack dab in the middle of such a (relative, perhaps) void.
Why is there always a tone of surprise that our current understanding of the cosmos may be incomplete or wrong?  Makes me wonder just how many years have been wasted due to egos.  Or what the solution is going to be.
Bubbles of dark matter... Quantum foam... Matter behaving like it does... Darn it, I'm too layman to put anything viable together, but I get a feeling we're on the right track
I'd love an episode of Euclidian vs non-Euclidian Geometry and stuff like that.
Theres a surprising amount of unquestioned assumptions in these models that we're only just now tackling with modern techniques. Estimations and approximations that we can now answer more accurately.
I cannot believe how much time and expertise is requested to create videos like this, that are simultaneously simple and detailed. Just a huge thank, and congratulations.
“Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.”
Where are the comment replies? q.q
Nice try, Gravity!
It would be weird to conclude every being of sentient life would have this discussion of being in the middle of void expanding space during it's evolutionary journey. Or do we get to lean into the flex of novelty 🤯
Light entering your eye does spin   one-half  when it enters your visual cortex..  your eyes are 6 degrees apart.

Wow these two possibilities seem insightful. I cant wait to see how they resolve in the future. This was a very fun video!
Look, im no physicist but... hear me out... photons are not massless! They can push and be affected by gravity.  I imagine the number of photons present in the universe at any one time is rather large 🤪  So estimate the number of photons in a given area then divide  the mass discrepancy by that number... voila, the mass of a proton. 😂😅😊
Even when Einstein was wrong he was partially right.
Can you post links to those animations of galaxy dilaments?
Am I the only one who says "of Spacetime" along with Matt at the end of each episode?  There must be others out there...in the vastness...of Spacetime.
Why do people even keep using cosmological principle when it's proven wrong by observations such as Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall?
I love seeing new theories in the discrepancy of the expansion of the universe, it felt like what could be incorrect math or observations were being explained by outlandishly high values of dark matter and energy
someone said this already, "That's a pretty intuitive solution for dark matter. I'd love to learn more and see if we can test it further." @viralarchitect  100% agreed. It just makes sense to me, keep it simple stupid. Two competing forces pulling things away from each other, causing a faster "expansion"
Is the expansion of spacetime what counteracts in someway the gravitational clustering of galaxies?
It's the 6 degrees of seperation
Soap lowers the surface tension of water, leading to the formation of bubbles. When bubbles meet, they merge and share a common wall. The structures they form look a lot like these clusters and voids.
The fine structure constant is 1. not 1 over 137. It's metric😮  Not decibels 😅
the voids are just K3  civilizations that are hiding and cleansing.
7:51 Nice
Intuition: Dark energy is an apparent force AND Particle wavelength for dark matter is stars and solar systems sized.
This is exactly what you got you guys into this problem to begin. Making reality fit your data instead of your data fitting reality. Every hole you plug springs another two leaks that need patching.
Hi Dr. O'Dowd!
Huh. Dr. Becky is legit? Her videos pop up from time to time in my recommendations, but the video titles and formatting, as well as the images used, often struck me as another pseudoscience channel so I ignored them. I'll have to give her channel an actual look.
I've wondered for a long time if maybe, just maybe,  the observed red shift seen in all objects outside our solar system is not due to expansion, but maybe space is not perfectly transparent to the passage fo electromagnetic energy.   We seem to assume that EM energy (just going to call it light from now on)  gets to pass through "frictionless" space that doesn't extract an energy toll from it.   But if there were to be an energy toll against the passage of light through space, it would take that toll not in a reduction of the speed of light, but in a reduction in FREQUENCY, thus causing a red shift and it would be proportional to distance.   This could help to explain some of the discrepancies we are detecting.
The PBS Spacetime/Dr Becky cinematic universe is for sure the most meta cinematic universe. More crossover events!
i'm wondering about this re: metpaphysics.  if the earth is in an oddly spacious area, perhaps there's some reason for that.  and perhaps other civilizations would be located in other such bubbles.
The universe isn't expanding. We are accelerating toward the great attractor. Everything ahead of us is accelerating faster. Everything behind us is accelerating slower. From our perspective it appears that the universe is expanding but the truth is that we are screwed. (eventually)
Suggestion: It would be nice to have links in the description, to papers referenced in a video.
I've never been a fan of Dark Energy so this Cosmic Voids solution appeals to my gut instinct. I remember sometime back that a team was starting a new survey to eliminate a bias they believed gave the false impression of DE.
SPACE BUBBLES! I think this should end up in some merch.
Just amazing how much cool arse science you pack into 15 minutes....
Just call them Dark Voids see it’s solved.
There could be quadrillions of failed solar systems (Large planet that never became a sun) throughout the universe. on top of that there could be another quadrillion of black holes that have nothing left to feed on. Dark Energy might exist but i dont think its as much as they say now.
I'm honestly curious to hear a more knowledgable person's opinion of this; how many things is cosmology would make sense/stop making sense if we assumed that we exist on the interior of a universe sized black hole?
Ok so i dont want the Nobel prize for this but: If the furthest galaxies we se are severely red shifted, surely any further galaxies will only show up in "less energetic spectrums of light". Example: microwaves or radio waves. So when we observe CMBR: WHY DONT WE ASUME THIS IS JUST YET FURTHER DISTANT GALAXIES (LIGHT FROM THEM) AND CLUSTERS OF GALAXIES? : youre welcome. 11:11
Indians call it "femine energy"   In ancient greek it was referred to ass "chaos", or emptyness
This is the most plausible explanation of dark matter/energy I have ever heard. "In the beginning the world was formless, dessolate and VOID"
Another nice side effect of void-driven dark energy would be no cosmic horizon. Sort of.  Everything would end up in filaments such that even at less than the speed of light, with infinite time one could traverse the entire universe. No heat death either.
"empty" space is a low density plasma.
If the theory that matter density affects dark energy levels and by extension, the expansion/contraction of the universe, I think It would correlate with the pattern in nature for other systems to be self-balancing, such as electrical currents and fluid dispersal. as the universe expands under dark energy, matter gets less dense, causing the universe to collapse back towards itself, which would cause the density to increase, more expansion, and the cycle repeats.
What is all this talk about discoveries of dark energy? The last time I woke up it was just a theorethical concept made up together with dark matter to patch 70%+ hole in our undersstanding of gravitational interactions on cosmic scales.
I wonder when or if the hypothesis predicts gravity overtaking dark energy, and if its within a time frame that may affect hypothetical "end of the universe" events, as we currently predict.
This one’s not even funny
Was the universal seed spinning? Everything spins, thats a given! Would that have an effect on the distribution of the universe?
It's written "Dr. Beck" (without a y) for her first link in the description
Makes sense
Has anyone ever tried to calculate the inertial mass of all the light?
When looking at these massive structures in space, like the Laniakea Supercluster, is the speed at which gravity travels taken into account? How much of an effect does it have on a model's results?  Like, when a particular galaxy "sends out gravity waves" as it travels through space, it's nearby neighbors will be attracted to a particular location well before anything at the far side of the structure. Does this lag affect how the different parts of the supercluster move around?
What if dark energy and the quicker expanse of the universe, art being caused by another universe dragging on ours?
Is there a chance that dark “energy” is an illusion created by the void bubble phenomenon?
There is no gravity. There is only one force, the void. The void pushes matter together. This explains both energy and dark matter and the accelerating expansion of the universe.
This is so interesting. I believe the fact we are in such an empty region of universe really can explain how alone we feel. Our star is a very average and non-special star, in an average non-special galaxy in the middle of a huge void in space. We are trully isolated and that is both comforting and scary.
Aren't Femi Bubble expansions fairly much the same thing as Cosmic Void expansions, just on smaller scales for Fermi Bubbles? If so, then the two would surely be combining local and non-local forces to re-enforce the same type of overall Dark Energy like effect. I'm sure this has already been accounted for if there was a need to do so, thought I'd ask anyway. Thanks Matt.
Before i start: 00:06 two of mty favourite ppl = me and you obviously. 11:11
❓ Could phase-shifted matter/energy (expanded idea of cosmic foam) account for time-space curvature, dark matter/energy? Would that phase shifted ‘potential’ be materially influenced by its own higher gravity well and experience time dilation in its own phase shifted state?
So Hubble constant is 69? Nice
TLDR: Cosmic Economics. :P
everything we measure and how we measure it are only a supposition of our theories. So, most, if not all, of these arguments on how to make it better, when the actual individuals KNEW and made it clear these calculations are ALL approximations and guesses, these are all just guesses and approximations. ❤🎉😂
If eternity is a vacuum, then all/any *singular explosions* and *singular compressive forces* must be absolutely symmetrical. Detonate just about anything underwater = symmetrical. Also if it's a vacuum, when an asteroid hits the ocean it doesn't leave a hole in the water, it fills back up. In a vacuum if the universe is *exploding* outwards* every single microscopic bit and energy at it's leading edge is only ever going to be attracted like tsunami waves to one thing - the gravity at the start of it's explosion. And it's going to come in as fast and symmetrically as it went out, because there is no gravity at the outside of a vacuum *if* the universe had an explosive beginning at the center (of a vacuum).
‘Crisis in cosmology’? Bring it on! Expanding our knowledge means transforming paradigms like The Standard Model. Good science is always in some sort of ‘crisis’. The real crisis is failing to adapt.
This guy is boring

Fascinating!
Would love to see your take on unified electro gravity

7:50 Nice.
What about the effects of matter bending space-time and creating curvature around these clumps of material. The furthest reaches of these curvatures would be these voids. Where space-time could literally be being pulled apart thus creating the space expansion. It's a theory that I've had for some time but I'm not educated enough to prove or disprove it
I think all this stuff is a bit "getting lost in details". There's probably so much inaccuracy and stuff that we just don't see for mundane reasons that we should just accept that the prediction and measurement agree to an order of magnitude at least, and move on to more important questions 🤷‍♂️
Is anyone taking into consideration the change in the passage of time in these Voids due to a lack of matter?!?  I don't think so.
What happens when the bubbles pop? BOOM!
I don’t understand how negative pressure helps the explanation.  If we are at the center of a void, matter closer to the ridge should be accelerating away from us towards a the ridge (until they reach it). We have detected that other clumps are accelerating away from us. Are those clumps also in that void? Can we even measure the motion of clumps on the outer side of the ridge?  By the way, “Maitre” is pronounced “metr”.
It's often a good sign when you see same mechanics at different scales : like the link between blackhole and whirlpools. It might be the case also for bubbles of water and cosmic void, but to be believable it should really  be more thoroughly checked  Thanks for the amazing vid for new year!!
I find calling it Dark Matter is misleading because we don't know what it is.  It's a anomalous source of apparent gravitational effect. It may not be matter as we currently envision it. And calling it Dark Matter will inevitably trap people's frame of view into thinking about it as matter.  Surely we can call it something that doesn't elude to it being something we don't know it is..
I have zero education in physics or astronomy. Yet i had this exact idea for a decade now. If you are located IN one of these filaments of high density, you'd observe all the galaxies coming TOWARDS you (and predict a big crunch). If you are located in one of the VOIDS, you'd observe all galaxies moving AWAY from you (and predict a big rip). The problem is also that we're not thinking about the larger universe beyond the observable limit. We might be in an enormous mega-void, with unbelievable densities surrounding us, causing the apparent rushing of galaxies away from us (if we're in the relative center).  Furthermore, this also ties into assumptions about the age of the universe. It assumes that all observed motion vectors for other galaxies and stars was 1:1 reversed "if we turn back time". Leading them all to naturally coaless into one point, on our heads... Since we appear to be in the middle of it (yes, if space expansion is a thing then everywhere would appear to be the middle).  But here's the thing we ignore because we're not even close to being able to calculate it (so we ignore it). The motion vectors of all the galaxies and stars we see, COULDNT have been simply reversed in direction. Because they all change directions and vectors depending on each other, depending on mutual gravitational interactions. The Andromeda galaxy didnt ALWAYS move towards the Milky Way, at some point in the distant past, it might have been moving at 90 degrees to the direction our galaxy was moving, but over time, with gravitational influence, it shifted direction slowly and surely. So we cant assume every galaxy ALWAYS moved in the same direction (or in reverse).  If you observe a car going North on a straight highway, you might assume, if you reversed time, the car ought to be located 5 miles South directly behind its current vector. But that's not what happens, because the car takes turns and corners, as it travels, so at the actual time you're trying to backtrack to, the car was nowhere near 5 miles directly behind it, it might have been far to the East or West instead, if you account for the turns it took.
Genuine question here. If the universe is expanding, and that expansion is accelerating, then there must be stars that we have observed that are no longer observable using the original observation method. With that, how many stars that were once known have been lost to humanity?
Great video as always! Would modeling the fractal geometry of Laniakea help us refine our cosmic distance ladder models? (Like measuring the fractal dimension of Laniakea, for example.) I'm no astrophysicist, but I can't help but wonder how an approach where we model the "roughness" of the universe could change how we think about cosmology.
Holy macrel! To explain the early hyper inflation (10^78 times epansion in 10^-32 seconds) the rest of the un observed universe would have to be BLACK HOLE like filaments or foam! THATS TERRIFYING AND AWESOME!
The Hubble constant in the local hole is 69.
Nice
Me, 10 years ago - Why must there be an even distribution of matter, thats a dumb assumption. Them - No, its the way it works, physicists know what they're doing. 10 years later: Them - Why must there be an even distribution of matter, thats a dumb assumption.
The thumbnail reminds me of the Elden Beast.
a bubble with surface tension...oh no....were just a fart inside some being
I do not understand why this is called the "crisis in cosmology".  I think it is better called the "opportunity in cosmology".
The Milky Way is in a relative void. Relative to the higher matter densities elsewhere. And this should result in higher gravitational forces on our galaxy? So the void is not like a Faraday cage where all points inside the cage have zero electric field and hence no force. Would not the gravitational pull in all directions cancel out so the resultant gravitational pull on points inside the void reduce to zero?
What if the universe is like a cloud with alot of glitter in the cloud and the solid liquid gas construction of the cloud is like the universe and outside our universe is wind and the infinitive
Uh didn’t the second OMG particle come from a Void?
Inflation just caused by being in a cosmic void is fascinating but how does it explain the early hyper inflation?
Fascinating indeed!
If only there was some sort of princess of this lumpy space.

I don't think I've noticed the closing theme before. Though for a second there it was busting into a cover of canyon.mid
Dark energy is heat singularities outside of entanglement of mass released from stars as decay of mass. It's throughout space itself and thermaldynamics singularities collide with mass as propulsion of perpetual motion of force. Mass loses heat and absorbs heat. Mass is heat in quantum magnetic fields as elements. Magnetic fields synchronized bonding force of pressure known as weight is magnetic fields redirected trajectories of magnetic fields as grounding or bonding force of pressure known as weight. When  mass moves away from earth's magnetic field weight decreases towards the greater magnetic field. Dark energy is potentially dark matter. Perpetual motion of heat is cold repulsion to heat propulsion from cold repulsion. Magnetic fields are repulsion at both poles and redirected trajectories of thermaldynamics singularities is propulsion in magnetic fields. All mass is heat singularities as magnetic fields. Decay of stars as dark energy outside of entanglement of mass is potentially dark matter or renewable energy. When heat hits atmospheres as renewable energy exchanging singularities in chain reactions of mass the atmosphere acts as a filament to the sparks of electrons and lights the atmosphere as daylight. Same thing as a lightning strike. Mass occupies space as neutralized repulsion as outward force. Earth's magnetic field redirects quatum magnetic fields in synchronization towards earth's center force of flow as grounding electronic fields towards the greater magnetic field as bonding. Magnets show Perpetual motion as bonding thermaldynamics singularities. Repulsion is the flow redirected trajectories. Smaller magnetic fields spin their quatum magnetic fields towards the greater magnetic field of force. Weight is pulling force apart from the magnetic field. Lifting weights is pulling against earth's magnetic field of force. No gravity. Heat and cold don't mix. They don't touch as the event horizon. Bubbles of pure cold space is repulsion to thermaldynamics singularities outside of the bubble. The event horizon is repulsion to thermaldynamics singularities outside as propulsion.  An external magnetic field that circling vortex around these bubbles of pure fabric of cold space devoid of thermaldynamics singularities nucleus. They don't let thermaldynamics singularities in. They repel thermaldynamics singularities outward and the poles are pure resistance where thermaldynamics singularities are jetted into space. Magnetic fields are repulsion at both poles. Thermaldynamics singularities are the propulsion in magnetic field generators as mass. Hydrogen has the strongest magnetic field of the elements. As mass expands its magnetic field weakens. External magnetic fields are black holes. Stsrs have multiple external magnetic fields. The core of stars is a internal magnetic field. When the external magnetic fields weaken and the pressure outward reduces the internal magnetic field draws them in and heat expands the core and external magnetic fields outward force of expansion. Heat passes through all mass as perpetual motion of chain reactions until resistance is overcome by open space itself. Dark energy outside of entanglement is left behind. Magnetic fields can only hold a finite amount of paper clips. Try it. All mass is quatum magnetic fields of forced pressure cycling circulation patterns in resistance to cold space as we occupy space and outside of occupational space. Spheres are proof of repulsion to thermaldynamics singularities. Thermaldynamics singularities pass through mass as propulsion of forward momentum or reduction of forward momentum. Depending on the directional pressure of the thermaldynamics singularities hitting mass as force. Perpetual motion is constant cosmic speed limit in resistance in and out of entanglement of mass. Magnetic fields just reduce distance from cycling circulation patterns. Theoretically factual probability that works with quantum physics without gravity. Gravity doesn't exist. Mass is outward pressure of propulsion. It doesn't collapse. Pressure doesn't collapse. Heat can't touch cold. Mass expands. Cold is constant. Thermaldynamics singularities are the variable.  Heat is the universal force of everything. Cold occupational space is the gelatin that cools thermaldynamics singularities as mass. Disrupted magnetic fields lose force and fall into the greater external magnetic fields. Theoretically factual probability that works with quantum physics without gravity. Mass is repelled towards mass as the weakest point of resistance and the greater magnetic field grabs it if it has the strongest magnetic field. Theoretically factual probability that works with quantum physics without gravity.
Nice
What an interesting video! I love this idea, though I am confused about a few things from the end, and would love it if anyone has any answers!  If the negative pressure from these bubbles is enough to explain all of dark energy, doesn't that imply that they are solely responsible for the expansion of the universe? In which case, why would the universe expand before these bubbles are well established, as Matt seems to describe?  If dark energy/expansion is entirely explained by this bubble negative pressure, then does that mean that each bubble is individually expanding?  Finally, it's hard to say exactly, but in the (beautiful!) animation at 12:20, it looks as if each bubble has matter pressing out to the edges, but not necessarily that each bubble is expanding. Even if each bubble is expanding, it still looks as if it's doing so slowly enough that, if we were in the middle of a void, then most of the matter within our void would indeed be moving away from us, but a lot of galaxies in neighboring voids would in fact be moving towards us. I would have thought that this was contrary to our observations that essentially all distant galaxies are moving away from us. Are these others too far away to affect our observations? Am I misunderstanding the diagram/model?
Matt, you talked a lot about how local structures could bias the supernova based measurements. Is it possible that same structure could influence our CMB based measurements? The CMB light would have traveled through the local supercluster/void to get to us and been affected by that gravity or lack thereof.
Wait a minuite were talkin bout lumpy space!  Lumpy space princess might be real!
I swear this guy could sneak in a demon summoning to the math segments and id never know.
Burghard Heim
Lol, cosmic lumpyness. I may use that as a song title. AND , there's actually a person in real life named  Shanks?!
You mean the hypothesized Dark Matter which has many predictions shown to be wrong.  In about hundred years is it that Dark Matter still has  not be found.  Scientific dogman
What confuses me is, if these "bubbles" pushed matter apart, how did our galaxy end up in the middle of one?
Maybe the expansion is just caused by gravity. No matter what area you cordon off in space, there's an infinite amount of matter beyond it. "Inward pull" can't make sense, can it? There's no center.
I have heard the best solution to problems has the fewest assumption and ties to the unknown. What if dark energy is the thing we already know warps or stretches space, gravity. These clumps form because the matter falls into some gravitational depressions and are more likely to stick around than continue on the path they were going. They are strings because objects traveling in the direction the string points are more likely to get trapped than perpendicular objects. Billions of years of gravitation going to a background average of sag or lack or support causes the bubbles. The string will always exist and only are endangered by other maybe larger strings, the local gravitation of the matter is far greater than the background sag and will not cause anything to depart. The enlarging background bubbles and the global velocity of the whole string keep it in its current shape. Given enough time and a ring might clump in areas and break up a ring, and clumping may have already been going on. The strings 8 billion years ago may have been a lot less dense, doing the same thing at smaller scales.
The crisis has already been solved by the electric universe
Always love your content, great stuff.  So I have a question / thought for you.  I keep hearing that the latest observations from the JWT are showing that the very distant and early galaxies that are “too old” and so shouldn’t be as developed as they are, so close to when the big bang occurred.  I also look at the models for the expansion of the universe, and there is the period of rapid inflation of 10^(-34) seconds or so, followed by the more leisurely expansion when more regular physics seems to apply.  Realizing that dark energy is implicated in the expansion and that the whole process is more complicated than will fit into a video comment (or perhaps my brain), the result was the very brief and rapid expansion which then transitioned to ongoing expansion… with some uncertainty as to why it was so rapid initially and why it changed to regular expansion.  SO  … what if that early expansion was not so rapid and extreme as we consider, but more in line with the ongoing and current expansion.  Would that regular expansion rate provide for sufficient time between the big bang and the age of those distant but more developed galaxies, so that they were more in line with what would be expected with regular galaxy evolution?
To sum up dark energy is real [effect] but not real [constant]. Which is a great thing. If the dark energy is going up then down to zero, then it's not a constant, one less constants to "explain"/justify in fundamental theories. Which should be the goal, to get rid of them. If constant then not just accelerating universe but the acceleration expanding faster, but with dark energy not constant, and going to zero does that mean expansion will stop? Not sure if it will start to contract, or then forever. Also what about in the early universe, is inflation and even the big bang out because of this?
I am a Simpleton but I have a couple thoughts/questions:   1) IMO a lot of things would change if we gave consideration to  the expansion of the Universe having had a "Push" early on in existence, meaning that maybe space back then was "Thinner" having never reacted to light or anything solid before? reacting to these foreign substances may change space itself therefore changing the speed of expansion? this might change a lot of numbers;)  2)   Could light itself have different speeds (faster or slower) moving through different parts of our Universe such as the voids or the extreme borders of our universe as we know it (Ever pushing into the blackness of nothingness, making something out of nothing because it never existed), If light slowed down or sped up at different rates it would give us somethings new to ponder and figure:)
I've had some bad experiences with some local hole.
Savant Wizard Prosperous Year of the Dragon 🐉   The  voids
Galaxies are holding together not by DARK MATTER but by STORM FORCE. That isn’t a tiltawhirl ride flinging meat around a basketball. It’s a highly charged, forceful massive swirl of stars, cold condensates, and other masses (heated/entropy) swirling around a common center, dense, cold, dead time. They start up galaxies. The black hole is the reason we expand. If you think about it, storms on earth with far less dense, lower temperature matter cause tremendous force, enough so that a firepit fire will chase a thick stick even against forces like gravity and atmospheric pressure. So the stars and galaxy swirling around Sagittarius A STAR are locked in by thermodynamics. Energy is our missing DARK MATTER. And black hole cores lock out empty space that normally belongs inside a given volume of matter. Time stops and they act just like a cancer, a growth. When we began the Big Bang we were hot and dense. Now, we are much bigger, more spread out, but the compressed matter makes a lot of empty space go around it. Earth is much more sponge like. Allowing empty black space inside and between atoms. Now crush those atoms and see empty space LOCKED OUT. Expansion by displacement. Sink a beach ball in a pool and see why we expand. Matter makes space curve IE gravity equals expansion. In each case we could probably count each and every single plank length and each mass and I bet they’d add up. Perfectly. Because mass gives space no choice but to grow.” 😉💯☑️
Bubbles. Makes sense to me.
Many years ago I predicted the cosmological constant was not a constant at all but rather part of a broader function dependent on...time. Later this was kinda proven baded on the new crisis in cosmology...dark enery is Variable dependent on scale and proximity of galaxies in relation to one another. Then came time feild theory, its experement, and mathmatical consistencies with the fine structure constant general relativity and quantum mechanics....several more predictions are now on the table. Without a doubt, devising Time feild Thoery is the scariest thing i've ever done...not only because new evidence only seems to validate the thoery..but the implications contained therein...just yikes. I've lost sleep over the idea of...what if i'm right?
Commenting at the beginning of the video: I’ve posited for a few years now that spacetime as a “medium” is likely not consistently dense. The “trampoline” could be more or less elastic in different places, or have holes in it. I’m sure I’m not the first to consider this.
Matt, I was surprised that was so interesting, especially when you were talking about nothing (voids). André
Maybe the Local Hole exists to keep humans quarantined? :P
I can solve the expansion issue
A black domain. Like in 3 body. Shhhh, there listening.
Can't wait to see the next video on this topic!
Wow... just run Einsteins equations assuming a flat earth.  It explains all of this nonsense.
The Böotes Void, is the most relevant feature in the Universe.
Never question the almighty Lamba-CDM model. When your data doesn't fit, rejig the dark matter free variables to try and fit it. And in an emergency when that rarely doesn't work, then let's add mystery voids 😂. That's modern day cosmology science in academia.
69? Nice
literally the best science anything to come out of the US.
Astrophysicists might review the dynamics of recrystallization of metal alloys and the varying structures that are formed. We sometimes refer to these interaction as formation of solid foam like structures with microstructure grains of differing boundary energy levels; elements or combinations of elements that pin boundaries or result in complicated microstructures. Much on the macro scale is mirrored by what is seen on the micro scale. Patterns repeat throughout all of nature.
Great work Sir! Thanks for sharing even if my brain is struggling to absorb these concepts! 🙂😎🤓
Yeees finally i have another oh so soothing pbs space time video to fall asleep to
Cosmic bubbles are the remnants of cosmic inflation which happened at big bang (big grind); which then produced the cosmic energy webs. The cosmic bubbles do not expand now, other than due to expansion of the universe, because the ingredients have been used up ie monopoles. Entropy takes place (happen) at all scales; expansion of the universe is increasing entropy at the largest scale. This universal entropy, under micro iteration, creates apparent universal space and time as a mental construct. Detail is everything (taciturn).
In recent years, I've found science is wrong on many things, and has become ideological in some areas. A shame.
Hasnt Prof Sarkar been saying this for a very long time now and that that observational data is not yet large enough to make many of the determinations made to date ?
Tom Kibble in the 1970's worked on a theory of 1D Cosmic Strings, giant space-time defects with huge gravitational forces. That the universe at it's largest structure exhibits visible matter as forming giant strings like a Pearl String, I have often wondered about them but being a dumb bunny, I have no idea why no one mentions Kibble's admittedly strange speculation.
Hi, the little bit of movie at 11:45 got credited to Stuart MacLean, but it's actually mine! Still nice to see my adhesion model visualizations are going strong!
Isn't it the case with the giant wall e.g. there are NO scales where the universe is uniform density?
Voids are where light is faster with no mass or matter to slow it down.
Nothing will ever solve the greatest problem in Cosmology, because the problem is ourselves...Good luck...xxx
It's not a crisis. Science doesn't establish truth or even facts just principles and models with varying utility.
Two @DrBecky references in a single @spacetime episode is significant
my "accidental" computer model of cosmology says dark energy is just a residual information phase falling into a universe from the boundless external compactified information phase outside of universes. In fact it implied a simple phase transition in a seed of this residual information caused the initial  inflation, resulting in a dark matter relic when equilibrium with the outside and inside of the universe was reached. Curiously it also implies that the inside of black holes is the same information phase as the phase outside of a universe and that black holes can transform dark matter into dark energy, neither of which is quantum in nature. The Quantum information being  generated by  the interface dynamics  where dark energy residual information and a compactified information states meet, a place which curiously seems to have three layers/modes....
Unrelated to the episode but I just love hearing how the channel's catch-phrase gets worked into the end of each. Just brings a smile to my face. 😊
This is what I always saw as *the* source of gravity, an interaction between VOID and matter, not matter and matter; with matter being pulled together like tiny weights on a flexible surface. I know the video doesn't go that far in interpreting this hypothesis but it's just so much more elegant and logical than "matter to matter" gravity as it is understood now.
Leave out the distracting background music. Would you add it to a lecture ? What's the difference?
If what we are saying about bubbles is correct, then would we see different constant speeds of expansion depending on the size of the bubble we were measuring? A bigger bubble might have a slower expansion rate than a smaller bubble which could measure a faster rate of expansion, however there would be interesting to see if there was a comparison between a large void and a smaller void next to each other and see how they push or pull on each other. Although how you would test or measure that would be difficult. Also is there any rotations of the large voids once we have a bubble created, as this could also be a factor, as well as clockwise and anticlockwise spins, would they be a factor in diving deeper into this or would that be too much detail🤔
These first assumptions that matter and energy are strewn across the universe equally it's probably wrong Because if you cannot see The whole of an object how can you describe it accurately? You can look at the microscopic scale of a pumpkin surface or a watermelon surface and see that there's stoma floors and cell membranes and such Which recline and line to look like a galactic voids And the edges being where the galaxies are clustered. so if you can only see a micron of that how can you extrapolate that to be an example of the entire universe you don't know especially at the beginning where everything is so compressed. and when it's that compressed time dilates so slowly so time will pass incredibly slowly. has anybody taken that into account? She left there is an area of delineation For a Big Bang Center say on the surface of the soap bubble that is our universe It's possible that when you get closer to the center things move slower And that as you get towards as it expands things are going to speed up a little bit Because they're no longer compressed as closely as they were thus exerting less gravitational force or effect on the rest of the Mass. Unless you can see all of number one you can't work in fractions and decimal points Our computers have proven this if you're off by the correct decimal placement your calculations are all skewed. look at climate Prediction There have been many computer studies the further you go back for decimal places more dozen places you add And use without rounding up the more accurate your prediction is but if you're only limited to say 10 decimal places you can't use the 1000 that you need to be accurate or the million or the billion that you need to be accurate. this needs to be taken into account what if we had one supercomputer that could use a quintillion decimal place Then we might have some accuracy on the Hubble Constant. happy New Year to you
The cause of dark energy is not uniformly dispersed.  Various voids will throw off the rate in different directions and distances. I am glad to see that you guys are catching on to this fact.
Then what explains the rapid early expansion of the universe?
They're now thinking the universe is not uniform? Shocks
I wonder how much brighter our night sky would be if we weren't in a void.
nerd diss: yo momma got a cosmic void between'er legs! OH! 🤣👉
The Cosmological Constant always amuses me. Even when Einstein thought he was wrong, he was right.
If dark energy dissolves, would that allow the universe to collapse on itself, or would all the matter be too far apart b that time for it to happen
"Assume a spherical universe of uniform mass and density..." and suddenly this joke from old school years is incredibly relevant to our model of the universe!
Galactic superclusters are just the rims of cosmic void bubbles. Got it. Thanks for the mindscrew today.
Crisis in HEP, crisis is cosmology... Physics is a joke. There doesn't even seem to be the first hint of progress anywhere. Still, at least "it from qubit" will save us! 😩
Judaism and its voids.
What is outside of the stuff at the furthest extent of the Universe (past the stuff we can see) at the "Universe Horizon"?  Couldn't that, in effect, also look like a void?  Like the entire Universe is inside a bubble with "negative pressure?"  Like the 'lack of universe' is the definition of anti-gravity.   Just spit-balling...  Does anyone else shout "he said the thing!" when he says "Space Time" at the end?  Or am I the only one...
*_As a layman I have that naive idea that these Persian guys have a very good point with their bubble tension analogy…_* *AND SINCE I'VE NOTICED THAT BUBBLE TENSION RHYMES WITH HUBBLE TENSION WHILE WRITING THIS COMMENT* *_I'M EVEN MORE CONVINCED…!_* #HubbleTension #BubbleTension
For a uniform shell / bubble of matter, the objects inside the bubble would feel no force, as the integral of all forces around the shell cancel out. So would that not be equivalent to the case where the shell / bubble isn't there at all?
At many points in the video you seem to be conflating the expansion of space (hubble parameter) due to its content and the _acceleration_ of that expansion due to dark energy. Dark energy is not the cause of expansion in a FLRW universe. The smooth distribution of matter is. The hubble tension seems, is in this case, not related to dark energy. And using the FLRW metric to describe voids and galaxy clusters seems inherently doomed, as they simply do not fit the homogeneity and isotropy assumptions.
The biggest problem with the void hypothesis is that structures 2 billion years large are twice as big as should be possible using current models. The real solution is to understand that the universe is natural and doesn't depend on mathematics or statistics for its existence.  Just because it is highly improbable, in other words, doesn't mean that it can't be real.
We need a Dr Becky collaboration.
😱🤯
Speaking as a layman, this is the most sensible proposition I’ve seen to explain (away) dark energy yet. Really, really neat - I am looking forward to following the development of this hypothesis.
Patiently waiting for a new Hubble Bubble constant to be announced.
Never did nothing matter so much.
Special theory and general theory are WRONG they are counting negative... they need to count positive... you can't shorten 1 sec... time is constant... Special theory and general are shrinking the 1 sec of consistency... CONSTANT TIME... and light is relative... We actually can fly faster than the speed of light... Imagine a straight line of SpaceCurve... doesn't matter which you bend...it always ADDS time to space... If you stretch the SpaceCurve, you are cheating the consistency of time... and calculations go wrong...
Though I'm in the vacuum energy camp. If they provide a credible testable hypothesis. Then there is nothing wrong with looking into it.
Always find it fascinating how our little star system is in a little bubble of unusually empty space, off a minor arm filament, in a small galaxy cluster, part of a relatively small super cluster, in the centre of a massive void bubble.  We're really out in the boonies
Dang! Yinz guys are smart!
nice
I've heard that the average density in the Local Hole is 78% of the average density of the observable universe. So the underdensity hereabouts isn't all that bad.
Please, stop to propagate a lie. Schwarzschild's works were not on black holes. Read the english translation of his first letter to Einstein in 1916, then the english translation of his second letter. https://www.jp-petit.org/papers/cosmo/1916-Schwarzschild-exterior-en.pdf https://www.jp-petit.org/papers/cosmo/1916-Schwarzschild-interior-en.pdf
This also assumes that the nothingness the universe is expanding into doesn't exert its own pull
To get the Hubble constant from the Cosmic Microwave Background, how do they evolve the Hubble constant without assuming the age of the universe? And wouldn't that make it more difficult to come up with an observed "Age of the Universe" after determining the CMB Hubble Constant with that assumption?
Matter=surface area  Space =volume ?
It feels like you can always be roughly at the center of a void if you allow for going as far out as you need to to find the outer surface of that void, even if locally you seem to be on one of these filaments of structure. This makes this explanation of always seeing this outward pull/negative pressure no matter where you are, intuitive. But the Huble constant you observe would fluctuate depending on where you are in the universe
Now, I'm going to have nightmares of void bubbles popping and taking us all with it.
Yay I love every new space-time video
Happy New Year Matt! ;O)-
Maybe a dumb question from someone who has an understanding of the concepts, but not the dimension and scales: If we assume an universe that is still expanding from the big bang, but slowing down overall, wouldn't we see the same as we see in reality? Near us we would see a slower expanding universe in "real time", like some million years, but the further out we watch the farther into the past we see, with the expansion rate still higher. So we get the illusion the universe expands faster the further away we look.  What do i miss?
Space is literally expanding yet your rent is still rising.  WAKE 👏 UP 👏 SHEEPLE 👏
BTW, the aî "Lemaître" is pronounced like a short e, not a long a. The middle syllable sounds like "met." Think "crème fraîche."
You are describing thermodynamic flow. The expression of dark energy and how it allegedly affects the formation of the cosmic web. The graphics look like a nuclear explosion, boiling and roiling heated clouds billowing outwards, the whole episode reminded me of the old movies showing the trinity test.
This episode raises some interesting questions about how much can we really know about the distribution of matter in the universe, given multiple observational problems: (1) The Zone of Galactic Obscuration (We can't see parts of the universe due to gas and dust within the Milky Way, rendering some dim, distant objects undetectable); (2) Our methods of estimating distances get less reliable with distance--We ain't measuring, we're guessing, and the reliability of measures of distance, volume, and density becomes highly questionable beyond the Virgo Supercluster; (3) The limited value of CMB observations.  We're sometimes pretending that the CMB gives us a "picture" of the very early universe, but about all that we can glean from CMB observation is that the distribution of matter and the temperature of the universe was once highly uniform.
This was incredibly boring and tells us nothing about the nature of dark matter or dark energy
I was getting sad when you started your outro since i knew the space time phrase was comin and the episode would be over. NOOOOOO
Making the geometry of the universe self creating it's own expansion is way more convincing than inventing a new phantom energy. I would even argue that this works also for dark matter on smaller scales. The inward gravitational pull of a Galaxy creates void around it, which can me thought of as a bubble skin that holds it together. Sure dark matter has a few other ideas attached.
Love the iranian theory. My high ass believes it 100%
Thank you for pointing out several possible general biases in measurements. It is a very interesting topic in itself. One further example of such a possible bias is the interpretation of the universe's age. If one calculates the speed of a universe's expansion on its observable edges, it is near the speed of light. So we should not be able to observe anything farther from the past than what's considered to be the age of the universe, even if it were out there. So if we make our estimate about the age around what we observe on the edges, we might be wrong because we are simply unable to see anything older because it is moving away from us with its surrounding space at a pace faster than the speed of light.
Dark energy and Voids, it's so obvious
That pronunciation of Lemaître was seriously cringe

Fantastic video!!  Very helpful.
Few questions: Isn't the current assumption that the majority of the energy of the universe is dark energy? How could the relativly small amount of matter (or more specifically the attraction between it) cause such a discrepancy. To me it feels like; we calculated that there's an invisible ocean hiding somewhere. And then later going, we found it; the missing water was in that glass in kitchen. Second question: Don't we need dark energy for the initial inflation of the universe?
Dark matter is fake news. No such thing
Checked out the t-shirts, found that the shipping rate is more than 50% of the price of the item. Will think about it.
2D bubbles?
Can the negative pressure be associated with the non-zero value of the Higgs field?
Dark energy being a result of the universe being a foam of galaxies makes too much intuitive sense. I hope it holds water
Typical. I’m in a Local Hole.
Even before there was more talk of voids and supervoids, I started to feel that some values are slightly different on local scalse, that things are a bit different from one general region of space to another. As time goes on, and we get a better idea of the overall structure of the universe, I'm thinking we'll have a better idea of how gravity might behave a bit differntly from one region to another, etc. The universe doesn't feel as "universal" as it was once thought to be.
Nahhh man!! Im really lookin forward to watch more on this cosmological problem stuffs! This supercluster research might be a checkpoint for something even bigger
Another thing that seems to be “pulling” on our space-time models of the universe is the galaxies with very high red-shift seem to be too “old”, or in other words there was not enough time for them to evolve because they must be (according to our current cosmological ideas) too young. But the metaphor that we are given to imagine the expansion of the universe is a balloon with spots on it. As the balloon expands, from the perspective of each dot, all the other dots seem to be moving away. OK, it’s a good allegory, but in the case of the balloon, all the spots were created at the same time (before it got blown up). Surely, there is a 4D geometry (curvature) of space-time that could mirror this situation, AND resolve the “tension” between the various Hubble-constant estimations. Just saying…
I feel a void in my head
Great vid as always. However I thought that there was a big problem with the physics of accelerating inflation/dark energy being due to vacuum energy, as the actual energy density required is wildly discordant with the standard model for particles and quantum field theory?
I am curious about occams razor, and if it applies to the nature of the universe. Blackholes to photons, and back, rinse and repeat. I am in Roger Penroses camp...
Happy new year PBS Space Time
I like this cosmic void explanation. It makes sense. I think they're onto something.
Good one, good work
That's a pretty intuitive solution for dark matter. I'd love to learn more and see if we can test it further.
Wow, I knew Dr Becky was awesome, but this is a big endorsement! =D
Could the fact that our supercluster is in the middle of a void explain why it hasn't been harvested by advanced grabby aliens yet?
The hypothesis is that dark energy could just be a product of the voids is so amazing simple yet feels so obvious that I unironically want it to be true. It feels like the least outlandish or sci-fi solution, the Occam's razor.
The Hubble Tension is palpable 😬
It's always in the last place you look ..
I have a silly little question about the basics. When we are measuring the speed of distant galaxies, how do we compensate for the age of the light we are measuring? At large distance what we are seeing is not what is there, but what was there a long time in the past. So, isn't the redshift we see also a measure of the recession speed in the past, and how does it plot against what we expect the speed and position to be now?
The slightest error in judgement leads to a huge margin of error giving a totally false perspective of the Universe putting oneself in danger so to leave it unchecked is unacceptable, we cannot afford to become slaves forever to anyone!
After trying to absorb all this information, it feels like I've found a local void. Not in space, but between my ears
Is it just me, or does Karl Schwartschild have googly eyes?
What dark energy and negative mass are 1 in the same
I've come to believe we are living in a Great Void.
As I learn more and more about physics, I become more and more annoyed that so many of the "great mysteries physics" boil down to, "well, 3 people made a simplifying assumption 30-50 years ago and no one thought it had any effects"
Love the Dr. Becky shoutouts... she's awesome!

If reversing flow of time . Explain a few things
wow, a channel with 3 million+ subs that doesn't make me lose faith in humanity.
So basically, they want to swap out the simple fluid dynamics of FLRW with the dynamics of expanding open-cell foam? Seems legit since that's exactly what the large-scale maps and simulations look like.
Could it be that there is a static structure to the universe and matter flows through this static structure like blood through a vein? Instead of turtles on turtles on turtles its people on people on people.
All fun and games until the first bubble bursts.
Here's my equation for Hubbles constant.  It comes from an assertion that for every change there is an equal but opposite change.  Turning the energy of expansion into an electron's field ...  H =( (alpha ^^ 2 (mass of electron) c ) ^^2 )/hbar  In si units this is: about 2e-18/s  .... in standard astrophysical units its about 63  (km/s)/Mpc.  I calculated this in 1998 before dark energy was a thing.  It basically says that for there to be an expanding universe the electron must be an equal but opposite expansion.
I'd like to ask one thing. Do I correctly understand, that Hubble constant is rate of expansion of the universe? If yes, we know that this rate changed throughout the history of the universe. So what does that mean, that Hubble constant have such and such value?
yay new episode. keep it going!
have people considered not only bumpyness on larger scales, but also on smaller scales? could the discrepancy between the observed and calculated values for vacuum energy be explained by a sort of bumpiness of space at very small distances and the energy being distributed along fractal surfaces? iirc CDT and asymptotic safety (have we have videos of those already?) propose a fractal nature of spacetime.
I love this explanation, lets see if we can prove it! much better than some unexplained undetectable energy
Here's to a great '24 to all of you!
one thing that seems often overlooked is how our or any other solar system developed from the onset up thru planet development. my perception is that it is anything but a " constant " process. it seems to happen in phases imo. who the quarterback is idk. the star or the galaxy. but the ties are much deeper on a multiversal basis imo, and involve more than what is " physical " . cause and effect is a constant random situation imo. what makes the next person male or female is complex , no more than what causes the next brown or white dwarf star imo , and how they " behave " . the spiritual structure of  " any space " isnt being considered. looking right here within our star system and or earth and or underwater should be no different. what a plant " puts out " in roots [ analogy ] has a direct relation to the outcome of what is visible on top/ above the roots  , along with other factors within the mycological network and above ground. just like human investment. its not all about nutrition imo, and there is little way to circumvent the process expecting quality improvements . so i would say that " voids " are more complex multiversially than given credit for. observing safaris or aquatic  ecosystems,  one doesnt assume that all are family or friends, there are alot of wars and politics happening , like everywhere else visible in this universe, except for how we view galaxies and star systems. gas is obviously the bounty, but as well life isnt always about food or money , as it is self.
Just butting in to say that I _love_ that you are now citing Dr Becky's vids - she does really good stuff - always worth a watch, and splendidly accessible.  The bloopers normally seem to indicate how much caffeine Dr B had or had not taken :)
I guess that PBS Spacetime will not come back to comment responses anymore?
At last! Evidence for the existence of lumpy space! LSP will be vindicated..
The title has a question mark, so the answer is "probably no but we don't know" without even having to watch the video.
A video on the great attractor would be sweet 🎉
What if the   The big rip happens 💀
Another awesome episode!!
Do any of these take into account effects of magnetic fields? It seems as weak as gravity is that in some of these structures magnetic fields would have considerable effects.
Btw, I don't know if y'all switched microphones awhile back but your audio quality has taken a hit
Welcome back and Happy New Year!
Lumpy voidy dark energy, fascinating 😊
Aristotle: "Voids are Impossible"
nice
I love it when Dr. Becky gets a shout-out.
This is terrific! Thanks
yay another Dr Becky thing 😄👍
The only Cosmic Voids I know of are the ones in my life when PBS Space Time doesn't upload.
Does Scientific American know you lifted this out of the current issue?
Exciting times
Just make sure to avoid the cosmic noid.
Amazing video!!!!❤❤❤❤
Fermi paradox. Can neutron star collisions being the only reliable source of complex matter be supportive of the rare earth hyphotesis?
Yay!!! SpaceTime is back!!!
Surely people have realised by now that both dark energy and the expansion rate is the universe can be figured out by discovering where all those missing socks end up?
One object in space to another:  I don't feel like going anywhere.  The space between them:  LET'S GOOOO!
Notification gang!
Needed me some O'Dowd today
Perfect title to fill the Spacetime void experienced through the holidays!
FIRST!!!
👺
This is easily my favorite YouTube channel
Shplerp
I think dark energy changes over time  The ? Is is it getting stronger? So how far under  -1 does W equal??
Let’s goooooo new video
Woo hoo it’s space timeeeeeeeee
