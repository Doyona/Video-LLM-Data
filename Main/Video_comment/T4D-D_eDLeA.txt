That ending scene tho
Our favorite chaotic trio
Cant wait for joe Biden to join in season 11
7:50
Rewatching this series 🥰
This was amazing!!!! 😂😂❤❤❤
this just made me so happy :)
This is my favourite episode
“president biDEnh 😰😰”
I know this is an old video but it was incredibly sweet and I just had to comment on it. I even got a little choked up at the end. So cute.
19:54 “I’m like a little troll” should be a custom horn on s10 it’s so funny
The cinamatigraphy in this video itself is so beautiful
Someone put the season 9 map on the bedrock market place and I bought it and had to figure out how to fix your door
Mumbo: *establishes an effective entryway into his vault* Mumbo after a lunch break: *discovers his vault got broken into by an over-excited Grian*
that was actually so cute
7:40 is there a tutorial for the door?
Plz can I join hermitcraft
We were always given hot toddy’s when we were sick. We added ginger to ours
level 69
I know this is kinda late but you could've used the sculk sensor/shrieker to make an and gate, where the stairs would only pull back if the sensor noticed you running over to it.
When asked "When is Grian?" I would have said "UUUHHH... RIGHT BEHIND YOU !!!!!""
I looking forward to seeing bidens mega base next season
grian screaming "YOU'RE BACKK!! YAYYY" Was so wholesome for some reason😭
Just make it so when someone breaks a block, it will be replaced by a new one. ;-)
grian scream lmao
Bro this vid in the ad rn the name is craftman. The person make this as a ad....
8:04 Grian was so happy that you were back 😭
15:20 *looks at the 1.9M views currently on the video*
“Yes” “No”
Omg I cried so bad with that scene 19:20
Mumbo, can we get a tutorial on how to make your 3x3 flush door?
What about Iskall?
I- I fell to my knees in my kitchen banging my fist on the ground laughing the instant i saw scar miss
I mean.. you running towards each other and scar just dying is actually the most scar thing to happen
I love the twirly things...
I guess you can say the door got bamboozled
0:42 "And this looks good." "Or does it?" *Vsauce Music Plays*
this episode was just the cutest thing ever!!
I'm offended
its a pretty secure vault. i mean statistically, theres a ~0.25% chance of someone getting in  MATH WARNING!!!  (views/world population)*100=chance of entering (2,000,000/8,000,000,000)*100=0.25(%)
Mondo So -sculchers streaking in the background
13:58 was so funny though
94395366774345325733
I still can't believe mumbos exp stopped at 69
Tbh I'm a little surprised Mumbo didn't go with the "door that has all the redstone inside and the door outside" concept he did an entire video on XD
Grian: its how much i missed you! Mumbo: guess you didnt miss me that much
Yes it was a surprise. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
I really wanted mumbo to change to his shovel to repair it with the xp...
I know this was 4 months ago, but it’s so great to finally see the trio reunited. The sheer joy that Mumbo has his 2 best friends back is just so wholesome
I think the testy vines look great, Mumbo!
Mumbo and Grian: The world's absolute best power couple
Honestly Scar dying seems so perfectly in character that I wouldn't mind it being in the final cut.
I like the twirlys.
There is a horrendus  unremovable ad in the corner of the screen, that does it, time to get an adblocker
Level 69😂
silly buttercups
They are called banchees
It's really nice to see these guys being such good friends and just being happy to see each other.
ok but i would kill to see biden on hermitcraft
*@[**14:57**]:* It is good that you are trying to keep it secret, but silence about that in this video would probably be a better idea.    Not going to be pushy though.
Who else decided to edit the ending scene as a joke?
Mumbo should just get some wardens to protect the vault
Does anyone know what is up with the thing in the top right corner popping up and talking about the chat ?
Trick for Xisuma's game: Just answer potato (or some other random thing, like stick)
RiP the redstone door
nice
Augh sadly I am behind on the mumbo content but that final scene. The wide-angle shot, the bridge, 3 worlds coming together,  ah! it's just amazing.
why did he reverse the honey and slime blocks in the door
Stair huggers
“ YOUR BACK :D !”
Name a more iconic trio than mumbo, grian, and scar. I’ll wait.
4:26 why did i instinctually think "joe biden" only to then hear mumbo say "president biden" about a second later what the fuck
0:00 are you ready for a state of trance put your hands in the air <bass drop>
anyone else mad that he switched the honey and slime configuration for his door?
You should invite one if those ai president Chanel s to hermit craft
Biden on Hermitcraft would be hilarious! The bumbling idiot wouldn't know what's going on! Get Trump, Obama, and Bill Clinton too to make the AI presidents playing minecraft a reality!
No elytra, sword not enchanted. Lol
4:30 I would’ve said texas to all of these
4:30 I would’ve said texas to all of these
mumbo trying to lie broke me
I can’t stop smiling 10/10 perfect
grian and mumbo are a couple
Anti fall grabby grabbys
Immense joy and laughter!
17:20 the series up till now comes full circle
hmmmm nice right on funny number :3
I stopped watching hermitcraft for a while but then I just watched this episode feels like I missed a lot. So, I am also back.
I’ve missed as much of this season as Mumbo has and I’m trying very desperately to catch up
Mumbo Mumbo It the TWIRLY WIRLY ARKANSA MANERLY MISTER MUNCHER TWISTER SIDE STAIR RAIL
This video is used as , straight up the youtube ad for : 'Minecraft PVP | Craftsman: Building Craft'
What’s the song in the ending scene 😫???
The boys are back together 😂
Um the railings babe railings. At least that’s what I think it is from an American pov
The last scene is so heart warming
1:30 bornister
I was rewatching this video, and when grian sees mumbo again, reminded me just how I was like probably a few weeks before this video was posted. we lost touch with my friend a few years ago because something happened with her account, and this perfectly explained how I felt.
The honeyblocks 🤣🤣🤣
Scar pulld a cobra move like he is a jet
10:02 What you looking at there bro?
Grian reacting to Mumbo coming back was one of the most beautiful things I've seen in the server 🥹🥹
1:02 i feel like that was on purpose for some reason 😂😂
3:18 Lol Doc accidentally synced his message with Mumbo.
The Gumbo team has finally been reunited, all is good with the world. :D 7:45 <3
Ik this is gonna sound wierd but why do I ship mumbo x grain so nuch?
Exp stopping at 69. Nice.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  lol best episode yet
I just had a thought- You and scar can team up to do a hotguy cinematic universe sort of thing-
goodtimeswithgrumbo
i love how Grian yells "YOUR BACK!" like it should explain everything. But still, it made me happy.
was it tnt let me guess i have just clicked on it and it has to be tnt or that purple thing
I’d just say random words
10:25...  ah nice
Super wholesome content.
Level 69, nice!
"where is grian" "at his home I think" question correctly incorrect answered, he is somewhere in Vietnam
Why did ur exp has to stop by 69.....
4:57 well, we already have Joe…
Glad to see you back mumbo! I love your content even more now. You know what they say "absence makes the heart grow..." now it bursting out my chest. I might need to see a Dr
Hey Mumbo, I was wondering if you could make a tutorial on the piston door you used for your base, it looks really cool and I would love to use it in my base. :D
Wow StarGame22 really just used this video as an advertisement for "Minecraft PVP | Craftsman: Building Craft" the best of mobile games of course.
Well this is pants, why is this video being used to advertise a mobile game called "Minecraft PvP: Craftsman Building Craft"!?
Just answer... Like... A number to each question? They'll be wrong answers
that ending scene is gonna be my wallpaper
This is so wonderfully wholesome! I love it!
mumbo i think you should make a separate video on how to make the piston door because even tho you showed most of it, the point where it is fully functional, you just dont show what you changed
you two idiots got me smiling like an idiot as well. Love it
The Trinity 🎉
19:08 That maneuver is STUNNING!
I am begging for the cinematic rendition of the first attempt, death chaos and all
Xp ended on 69
69 level
3:19 Doc says the exact same thing as mumbo at the exact same time. It's almost like a caption.
Mumbo and Grian have such a heartwarming friendship and i love it.
Imagine the vault door with the calibrated skulk sensor
10:29 _nice_
The XP stopped at 69😂😂
THAT ENDING RULES!
I actually have all seasons up to eight that I can actually join cause when you guys finish a season it goes to Bedrock for bedrock players to join so I play it on my phone when I don't have access to my PC if I'm going out
A12360z
A!x^
Mumbo answering “president Biden” to one of x’s questions is even more perplexing considering they are both British
Mumbo at start: I will never show you how to get into the vault or the inside of the vault.  Mumbo now: shows exactly how to get into the vault and the inside
they are called the grian savers
This was incredibly heartwarming. It's good to have you back
The beautiful cinematic reunion was so good
Can’t wait for President Biden to join the Hermits. Let’s see if HE can fix the hermitcraft economy.
i think they're uhhh called baristas
Why is this video suggested to me as an ad for "Minecraft PVP | Craftsman: Building Craft"?
I’m trying to recreate your vault but I can’t really see the red stone door
12:45 Lvl 69 after taking a shower with Grian ;)
The boys uniting is the best thing I have ever seen
7:50
There's a Minecraft clone linking to this video as an add for their not Minecraft game
mumbo you could have made the vault door a flying machine . less redstone and satisfying
WOOOOOO BEST ENDING TO A VIDEO EVER.
Best ever ending 💜
The edge of the bridge is called the crust.
president Biden🤣
15:04 Mumbo, how could we be angry at you? He sounded like he was talking to a personal friend asking, "If I do it one more time, will you be angry at me?" Amazing ending!!!! 11/10! Bravo!! It was the most heartfelt cinematic reunion I have ever seen amongst friends!
1:14 Those are clearly cranberries.
The US President is joining Hermit Craft next? The server will be getting a bit hectic
couldnt you just keep saying "3" for the 45 seconds?
Femurs. You asked for a wrong answer.
Can we name the world eater Alduin?
𝕀 𝕘𝕠𝕥 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕠𝕟 𝕒 ℂ𝕣𝕒𝕗𝕥𝕤𝕞𝕒𝕟 𝕒𝕕
Mumbo and grian is the greatest thing ever
why is no one talking about the fact that the levels stopped at 69
Just “oh, well that’s weird, they’ve been in my inventory the whole time!” Lol
How beautiful is Minecraft man  especially with true friends
Mumbo flat World have more machines than we have on our planet 💀
Someone is using the thumbnail for this video to promote their Ad: Minecraft PVP | Craftsman: Building Craft  Didn't know where to mention this other than in the comments of this video, don't even know if Mumbo will see this but hopefully he'll get the Ad taken down
Not Mumbo, a British man, saying President Biden 😭😭
Dkdkskcjc
10:25 NICE
Litter box
the bridge scene was a chariots of fire moment lol
Love the cinematic shot
Mumbo use a keycard system instead of a button.
1:13 Those are legs, your base is a space bug now, get 6 legs each side and it might just run off and build a base of its own :')
Noice xp at 12:08
We need nametags for Xisuma and Mumbo because for a moment there i had no idea who was talking
Before Mumbo even mentioned the vines in his base I had just thought they made a nice contrast to the uniform structure of the build
1:15 wheel chair curbchecks
69 nice
I like the vines. Put string on top to pause the growth. Or maybe funky ‘shrooms or stuff
what is that song at 19:00?
At 10:22 in the video why was has level that number
Ballast
10:29 nice levels
Thanks to mumbo's obnoxious break he got to learn about cinematography and make  that amazing ending.
yeah theyre called stair crusts
The reunion scene with scar and grain couldn't have been any more of a perfect way to decribe the trio. Scar being late and crashing and Mumbo slipping off the edge afterwards.
how did i miss 2 seasons?
the fact that he was standing there slurping up all that xp while an almost-broken shovel just sat in his hotbar irks me to my core
Now waiting for iskall to return to hermitcraft
aaaahhhh the blue block palette is returning season 5 flashbacks
does anyone else want to free rome mumbos redstone testing world
Good to have you back
Did you seriously die and lose 67 levels?? 😭😭😭
69 nice🎉😎
1:10 theyre called handlebars
SO WHOLESOME❤❤❤❤
10:22 nice levels ;)
When you were building the entrance staircase I personally think that adding some warped logs would have looked good giving it more cozy vibe with what you have, because it would add a purple to the build where I feel there is too much of two different colors, where I think you could add more personality to the build in certain areas. This is just an opionion but if you don't understand what I'm trying to say, I think you should add some purple to the build and maybe a little magenta in darker areas.
Since you’re the richest hermit, wouldn’t it be cool if you had a bank and you could loan your diamonds or materials and charge interest when they repay it?
Idk
Mumbo in the future be like: Oh no, I only have 200 stacks of diamonds!!!
*Joe Biden Has Joined The Game*
7:43 :/ Hi! This only comes from the viewers from my channel to see the original before mine
the opera gx rgx thing completely destroys the video the ONLY video that gets destroyed by opera gx rgx is this mumbo jumbo video what an achivement
XP ending on 69
Where is the next episode?
I almost cried at the end
MUMBO!! MUMBOOOOOOOOOO! THIS IS HERMITCRAFT!
THE LEVELS STOPPED AT 69 💀
I like that the XP levels stopped at 69.
this entire episode is just so cute. grian being so happy that mumbo is back, the reuniting scene with the two of them and scar, just *chef's kiss* the gang's all here
Can we talk about how much more British mumbo and X sound when they are together, it's amazing
I know this is late but mumbo check one of your bases from the outside Jimmy has left you a sign
I know it’s supposed to be a secret entrance, but I think the shrieking crevasse should open the door
10:09 NICE!
Thought you should know, I saw this video, in its entirety, being used by YT to advertise an unrelated mobile game.
Jumbo mumbo
He lost 69 levels T_T
hes back! then we go two weeks without episodes.... hes not back boys. he never will be. hes got the money, his heart isnt in it anymore.
Mumbo you should put a mumbo statue on the top of your vault as a throwback to season 2
Biden on the server XD
You know what i just realized? We've been just sooo on point with mumbo being gone for so long. But then again, we kinda forgot about other hermits who are missing, such as, well, iskall. His last HC video was 8 months ago.
10:09 nice
I cried. It was so heart warming.
What if Minecraft would be Mechanical? That would be great Im Buiilding right now with Conquest Reforged the Victory Mod and the Engeneer Creative Mod. a Windmill and Waterwheel Medieval Industrie Zone in our Tudorstyle Medieval City.
I’m disappointed that Mumbo didn’t say “In my heart” when Xisuma asked where Grian is
Ugh what's X doing in this video?  He should be spending more time working for Microsoft directly.
ok but i just GOTTA see the replay mod recording of that first take
I'd love to see a hermitcraft season with mods like create
No one's gonna talk about how the exp stopped at 69 levels? 10:20
You three are sure really look cute
Level 69.  Giggity
love the reunion but i kinda miss iskall
All that was missing was them shouting each others names like in Madagascar.
Can't wait for president Biden in season 10!
Am troll now
It's the good time with the grain of the three mubosketeers
You're 1 of the hermits !?
7:50-18:45
can you make a secret base in a secret base in a secret base in a secret base with no mods no commands and no pistons.
You probably won't see this, but a Minecraft ripoff game is using this video as an advertisement.
For the next person to join You should have said Geneirkb as a nod to season 1, even though I'm full aware you joined in season 2
Never forget that Mumbo Jumbo is just an anagram for J'Mum Um Boob.  So glad you're back Mumbo, we missed you. ❤️
I think the second take was perfect. Just three friends with events that screams their character.
With the so I would leave and rejoin loads
Hey Mambo Jambo what free by free tour industrial not working You know why
Not sure how to break it to you Mumbo, but if you’re more often than not sounding like a talented builder, it’s probably because you’re a talented builder
8:05 "its been a year daddy"
now someone needs to make an ai voice thing for joe biden on the hermitcraft server
nAiCE
14:35 Mumbo really just used a button to get into his base surrounded by sculk sensors
Ah yes Biden is joining hermit craft
Hey nate do you remember grant?
Once upon a time, in the blocky world of Minecraft, two famous YouTubers roamed the land: Grian and Mumbo Jumbo. They had very different approaches to playing the game. Grian was a master of creativity, building intricate structures and creating stunning works of art. Mumbo Jumbo, on the other hand, was a technical wizard, specializing in redstone engineering and automation.  For a long time, the two of them had admired each other from afar, watching each other's videos and marveling at their unique talents. But whenever they tried to collaborate on a project, their different playstyles clashed, and they found it difficult to work together. Grian would get frustrated with Mumbo's focus on technical details, while Mumbo found Grian's artistic flourishes to be a distraction.  Despite these difficulties, Grian and Mumbo Jumbo continued to admire each other's work and found themselves drawn to each other. Over time, they began to realize that their differences were actually complementary. Grian's creativity could bring beauty and personality to Mumbo's technical projects, while Mumbo's precision could bring functionality and efficiency to Grian's designs.  One day, as they worked together on a massive build project, they found themselves in a heated argument over the best way to approach the project. But instead of getting angry and frustrated with each other, they took a step back and looked at what the other was doing. Grian saw the cleverness in Mumbo's redstone mechanisms, and Mumbo saw the beauty in Grian's decorative touches. They realized that by working together, they could create something truly amazing, something that neither of them could have accomplished on their own.  As they worked together, they found themselves growing closer and closer. They shared stories of their childhoods and their dreams for the future. They laughed at each other's jokes and stayed up late into the night building and tinkering.  Finally, one day, as they stood atop a towering skyscraper they had built together, they turned to each other and realized that they were in love. They confessed their feelings to each other, and their partnership blossomed into a full-blown romance.  From that day forward, Grian and Mumbo Jumbo worked together seamlessly, combining their unique talents to create amazing creations and build a life together in the blocky world of Minecraftia. They had learned that even though they had different ways of playing the game, they were stronger together than they ever could be alone.
I made a similar redstone door in my own mc server and man the struggle is real. "Is it this? No" "Is it this? ... no" "oh it's this"
president biden! 🤣
10:20 it ended on 69 lol
Let us see the inside
Hey Mumbo, I have a challenge/need some help with a fairly simple redstone idea.  I built a throne (4 blocks wide, 4 blocks tall, 2 blocks deep) that reaches from floor to ceiling. I later realized I wanted to have the center blocks be able to be moved out of the way to give access to a Nether portal behind it. I have the seat slabs being pulled into the floor and having the floor blocks being put back working perfectly. But now I'm stuck with pulling the back of the throne up into the theater.
Soo technically Grian could get any diamond in your vault. He beated the vault
"It's cute!" "You put my head on a spike."  🤣
still a better lovestory than twilight
I got here in season 6 and had to leave mid season 7 and am so damn glad I’m back on here
Look at Mumbo's xp level 😏
Imagine a huge impressive vault door that fills the inside with redstone, leaving only room for an enderchest.
when all the exp was being collected it ended at 69 lmao
Could you make us a 20 x X 10 y piston door for bedrock, it’ll be interesting to watch.
Episode 9, man is on a grind
so excited for president biden to join the server
That was beautiful. I genuinely clapped when you reunite, that's an awesome moment! And that ending cinematic is just perfect. Even perfect-er when you know Scar died milliseconds after the fade to black, such a natural thing.
When the XP finally stopped… nice!
10:16 nice
Mumbo Jumbo's minecraft skin + Ellegaard's armor = AWESOME
Mumbo stoped on level 69 😂😂😂
10:21 Nice
President Biden? Mumbo been watching too much TikTok 💀
dear mumbo could you hide the actually redstone-block things like pistons or such in upcoming redstone build videos ?
A mobile Minecraft ripoff just used this video as an ad
Always be yourself mumbo
the thing on the stairs are banisters . (right answer)
I feel like the 1st attempt at the ending was equally perfect grian and mumbo messing about and scarr dying
69 levels lol
Portal-sounding "player" 5:53
nice.
When I saw the redstone, my mind went "Uhh that's confusing but I want to try it"
There things there to make you commit die
The ending scene was so impeccable, my eyes were watering.
I was low key worried about hermitcraft since Mumbo left, but god bless I’m almost as happy as grian now
1:15 you meaning railings?
IDEA: To prevent Grian from getting in, when you get inside your vault, there still is one tiny room with an ender chest. In your ender chest, you have a code on a piece of paper. Then, you throw the piece of paper into a hopper. Then it gives the code back to you to put away, and the iron door opens. The code you use is the only code that should work. A random code will not work. I think this is a good idea to add because if Grian finds out where that button is, which he probably will, you still have  some security.
1:16 anti-fall off edge and die
nice mumbo, nice levels...
would it be possible for you to show how you built that vault door? I want to put it in my own world but can't figure it out
Trainiy rail hand bob yoyo
It's so good to have you back!!! And also. How much we've missed you three together
Mumbo I’m so glad you are back 😊 hermitcraft has not been the same without you
Please tell me it felt so good
da
the fact that mumbo's levels was at 69
it just warmed my heart to see Scar was invited.
Love how this is episode 9 for you and everyone else is on 30
how have you not heard otherside yet
Join 3rd life pls
Stair non faller offers
10:24 69 EXPERIENCE POGGERS
One word, EPIC!
Need you on limited life smp my friend
XP lvl 69 lol@
Who will be next to join hermit craft? *British fear intensifies* aeEhah PresIdenT BidEn??
Pls start uploading more hermitcraft ur only 9 episodes into it 😅
Hello
There isn't really a nice way of saying this, but putting skulk shriekers all around your base is a stupid idea xd
The side bits are called, joe Biden holding on for dear life after falling out of plane!
When the XP finally stopped you landed on a very NICE level
It's so evident that mumbo knows his movie magic stuff
For the game where you give the wrong answers, just keep saying pineapple and you’ll probably win
Mumbo did u hear because of u and train Minecraft son best game of the year in kids choice awards
0:01
President Biden 😂
Wow, it usually takes me about 50 minutes to answer all questions wrong on test...
Okay @ThatMumboJumbo, I have a redstone challenge for you. Build a machine that can stop time in the game without any mods.
The ending gave me chills! Wb
woah last time i watch you videos it was on season 6. now its season 9 time does move faster nowadays
*level ended at 69* Nice.
Ok I’m not gonna lie. The slow motion reunion was pretty epic. Scar has some serious skills for how often he doesn’t lol
What is the song playing at the end?
Actually, Mumbo’s cinematography is so beautiful
Haha reunion
6:31 this is why I subbed. May God bless you in Jesus’s name Mumbo!
The ending was so cute omg
Mumbo has definitely seen the biden ai playing minecraft tiktoks
Please please use the Grumbot content generator.
Mumbo you should ask Doc to show you around his redstone builds in the Perimeter
I'm hoping praying that artists out there drew this moment ☺️
That trailer at the end, I dub it “Fellowship of the Block”
They’re called stare rail things duh🙄
Omg Scar's absolute fail on the bridge was so very on point 😂
It’s Mumbai having 69 levels in the end for me
i half imagined a series 4 doctor and rose reuniting scene where mumbo and grian are running at each other in slow motion and then scar comes in and hawkeyes one of them
his xp at 69 the whole time. nice
That ending is so perfect. The smile on my face made my cheeks hurt. I love your guys friendship so much.
Okay now we need president biden to join hermitcraft
I want to see the vault open from affar
This is even better than when I found out MCR was getting back together 😭🖤😂 the boys are back in town!
There called anti fall guards
The only thing I can say is that was beautiful!! ❤❤❤
Video 164.5 of me bringing up the video “Can Mumbo Jumbo top this” by looneyloser until Mumbo notices it.
It stopped at 69 levels.... Nice.
Wasn't there an agreement if he broke in...
This made me soooo happy
They’re barristers 😂
So are we not gonna talk about how Grian gave a perfect 69 to Mumbo???? The xp lvls I mean
Is it just me or does mumbo sound more like a builder than he already is
All that free XP and at no point did Mumbo switch tools…. Pro move. 😅
15:30 mumbo woke up and chose to steal 5 honey blocks instead of 4
I like the plants growing into the sky
Months ago, thinking when I would see the trio together on Hermitcraft and seeing this moment just make me smile. Hope to see more episodes coming 🫰🏻
such a beautiful shot
The bromance is real
grian gave you 69 levels. nice
So, that's where all the xp bottles that were for sale went.
You need to see grumbot
I am now expecting your next video to be titled "Soooo I got president biden to play on hermitcraft"
Is poualtry man back?
The ending looks like the good ending of HermitCraft season 9
Okay that cinematic shot turned out amazingly though! I wish I could recreate that with some of my friends.
You're going to change that input won't you?  And your going to hook it up to a trap.  Otherwise you wouldn't have told us "not to" tell anyone, that that is the button which opens your door...
Holy, I'm Chaffed into bits. When Mumbo and Grain switched skills for a bit, Mumbo being a builder, then Grain as a Redstoner, Holy Bits
After the tik tok deep fakes I support getting a politician on hermit craft seems funny
Que Sweeney Todd voice: at last! My heart is complete agayn
XP stopping at 69: Nice...
Railings. Those banisters, are called railings… :D
10:09 Nice
You can't be a Troll; you don't live in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Those living in the UP are Yoopers as they live above the bridge and Trolls like me live below the bridge.
Btw, those things are called Bridge Crusts
Everything feels complete with Mumbo and Grian hanging out.
President Biden being added to Hermitcraft is the fastest way to halve the hermits' subscriber count😂
Mumbo I missed you and now I can do my math homework while I watch your videos again 🎉🎉🎉hope you got the time off that you very well deserved
That bridge scene was so beautifully Scarlike, but also perfectly portrayed their friendship in a few seconds
The sides of stairs are called peripherstrations. The peripherstrations you made here look quite chobblesome.
The oficial reunión shot was.... beautiful
President voice ai in hermitcraft?
I can’t breathe 😂😂 I can’t wait to see president Biden join hermitcraft (literally crying)
every time I see a Mumbo Jumbo vid I learn a new british word
why did i get emotional at the end scene :') glad you're back mumbo!
My face hurts from smiling so much. This was the best episode since the Grian, Ren, and Iskall voiceovers.
am i the only one who was hoping his xp would land on 69??
Watching you lvl up...   Nice
How did mumbo not know that the blocks he was using were called "skulk sensors"
Oh hell nah biden cant join hermitcraft he would  build kid sniffer island ☠️☠️☠️🤮
We need a tutorial to the first door in "A secure vault door in a secure vault door in a secure vault door..."
Exactly 69 levels. Nice
Please I just want to see more of Grian attempting to break into the vault
Scar falling to his death, Mumbo falling to his death, Grian hung up by his thumbs and burned alive, yes Hermitcraft truly is complete again.
Mumbo: I'm not a smart buildery pers— Me: Scar literally knighted you as an official builder a whole season ago, relax and believe in yourself!
The scariest thing is that my wrong answer for next Hermit was Trump.  Pretty sure that would be more entertaining than Former Vice President Vegetable.
I think Mumbo forgot grian pushes every button and leaver he sees
this is so friggin good
their called slides fyi
Loved the cinematic shot, made me tear up!
Love your videos!
Man mumbo had 69 levels and he fell, imma cry.
I love the twirly bits coming out of your trenches
I think the long twirly things inside the base look good! I like the height variation, so I would add some string to prevent them from all reaching the same height.
"Dont tell anyone that this is how you open the vault" *proceeds to upload a video of it to channel with almost 9M subscribers*
Can't wait for Mr President Joe Biden to join Hermitcraft!
Heard it yourself guys the president is joining hermit craft!
I really want to see a slow motion of that failed attempt where Scar died.
Perfect goofy smile type moment
during the reunion bit i was literally doing little feet stamp stim thingies cause ahhhh friendship
I was totally expecting Mumbo and Grian running towards each other in slow motion and then Scar "Hot-Guying" Grian off the bridge just before they reach each other.
Nice
Biden joins Hermitcraft, and starts harvesting sunflowers to make "chocolate chocolate chip" ice-cream.
that ending scene was unironically beautiful
Bro made me cry with the end
I think it would be super cool if the vault was filled with tunels instead of that staircase. Like a labyrinth of quartz tunnels with different redstone contraptions.
Welcome back Mumbo ❤
Mumbo you should make a steampunk castle with the create mod drawbridges and everything!
(wrong Answers only) No there not called Banisters - there called SYFFOTS or Stops you from falling of the sides (Pronounced Si F Ots)
Timestamp for Grian and Mumbo Reunited Scene: 7:50
Can we all just appreciate the hilarious yet pure relationship Mumbo and Grian have. I'm glad they've been reunited.
that cinematic scene was great! 😂
Aww, The classic trio reunite! My  heart is melting <3
The scientific name for the "banisters" is stair rail doohickeys
Back again! Aw, this was so much more wholesome than I was prepared for and I love it! The vault door is really cool btw
Slime block floor between gate and door
The Blue bridge spaghetti is the word your looking foor
10:22 nice
You heard it here first folks! President Biden will be the next member on Hermitcraft
imagine if all three stopped uploading after this? this would be the last memory of their meeting before their happy ever after xD
That's a rather *nice* number of levels you have there at 10:23
4:42 Go go gadget Biden voice AI
Mumbo actually got two questions right (or wrong I guess), Redstone is confirmed to be magic and not electricity which is why copper doesn't do anything for Redstone.
That actually brought a tear to my eye 🥲❤
Nah if the President (US) actually joined hermit craft I’d die
mumboooooooooooooooooooo
ur levels ended at 69......
His XP stopped at 69 lol
Reunited and it feels so good
I MISS THE ORIGINAL DRAGON BRO );
Nice
Mumbo + Grian = amazing
arm pit smell
1:30  They are the                         stepy walkway arms
I'm never going to be able to get the thought of Joe Biden on the Hermitcraft server out of my head now 😂🤣😭
I believe that those are called bumper guards
I mean so you like a good opening.
Grian got you up to level 69  nice
He mumbo jumbo I made something in Minecraft that I loan from your videos it might not be as good as your Redstone Creations but I think it's good
biden pullin up to hermicraft following his tour to ukraine while still skippin out on what’s goin on “Down in Ohio”
10:20 Nice...
change my mind
grian and mumbo are the best of friends
Those stairs along your entrance party are clearly edge-y bits
4:25 can't wait for the deepfake memes of this
Lvl 69, nice...
Biden for heritcraft 2023
Cinematic end scene--an emotional moment... With the goofiest flip side, as we'd all know and expect. Glad you're back, Mumbo.
🤤🩸🫀🩸👀😨
💰🤤💰grab a jab💰
B€TTÈR HÜRR¥ BĒFORE TH€ SÇÛLK $PR€@D$
Hermitcraft along with the other world will collide making the whole multiverse into sculk you NEED TO STOP IT NOW BEFORE THE RIFT GETS WORST SPREADING UNTIL THE WHOLE SERVER IS JUST SCULK
The button is a phony... a red herring if you will.
10:20 Nice
The EXP stopped at 69...  ...nice.
Excellent cinematic
10:19 "Nice."
This made me genuinely so effing happy hahaha!!
Lol the behind the scenes
the twirlies at the Vault look great!
That shot was actually so goooooood!!
That brought an actual tear to my eye.
First Tim I’m seeing you do red stone and I was just dumbfounded😂
now we just need iskall
And with that, Hermit Craft, season 9, Comes to a close.
I freking love thet  the enchantment  level literally stops  et level 69, I'mean  seriously whet are  the chances of  thet happening.
watch president biden be the next hermit
Grian breaking in and creating an XP rave is just so wholesome. He sounded so excited.
i can't wait for president biden to join hermitcraft
I personally really like the very tall swirly blue plants around the base, it's cool to have swirly organic not simetrical things to contrast the uncle scrooge cube
When he finished collecting all that XP when Grian supprised him check his level. Go to 10:25.              Noice
69 levels. Nice.
2:08 they protrude from the ground making it look like something is possessing the building
69 levels, nice
why does it feel like one of you is going to betray one another at the end, like this is the last moment before that betrayal
nobody gonna talk about the levels?!?
the arm stand 1:10
You deserved a like for making that door
Hey mumbo-jumbo  I'm a huge fan can you do a shout out it don't even have to be to me I want to impress my friends in  our smp so can you shout out Dynasty smp in one of your videos please
The fact that he stopped at 69 xp levels.
Those things on either side of the stairs are called the “ no fall walls. “
The fact that every time you squat to Otherside You're PRESSING SHIFT WITH YOUR THUMB is mildly infuriating to me.
Experience level 69 nice!
Mumbo and Grian are the greatest duo
So heartwarming. Glad you guys are all back together. Missed seeing this to say the least. Looking forward to many shenanigans
Dropped a tear at the end
at 10:42  nice
I miss Iskall85 so much ! ❤
Their freindship is so wholesome:3
Heart-warming
The fact that the amount of exp that you get from grian surprised stop at the perfect number lol
Man, I know it's a silly thing and all, but that ending got me really emotional <3 I'm glad we have you back Mumbo
I laughed waaaaay too much watching this while my girlfriend studied and was kicked out of the room ... Worth it, we missed you mumby
mini staircase growths
Beautiful
69 LEVELS LOL
Hi
Was expecting a HOT GUY! Mildly disappointed... WB though Mumbo!
I have to admit the thought of president Biden on hermit craft is hilarious. He would probably drowned in the 1st puddle he came across. Because he is a grandpa who has never played a video game in his whole life.😅
That reunion scene made me so happy
*level 69 noice*
Anyone else think the vault door looks like a guardian?
The deep dark sounds throughout the start were scaring the crap out of me.
This episode was all my hopes and dreams I love this trio so much
i am so happy you are posting again!
🥲
Sorry to say this but I was hoping against might that the xp would finish at level 69 and it did. 🤭
This come back was everything I hoped it would be 🥺🥰🥺🥰
Stopped at 69 levels. Nice
The friends are reunited:  Iskall: hold my iskallium, fellas. I'm coming.
Can you do a tutorial on how to build a door like that?
GRIAN'S. WELCOME. BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please don't put biden on hermitcraft 😂 the server would be a mess
Just 😮
4:27 Mumbo makes a sus sound.
Well yeah he had like 6 months to do it.
lets goo nice video mumbo :D
"President Biden" response killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
mumbo please I need you to remove the shrieking😭😭
love how the levels ended up at 69 10:20
The boyz are back! All they need now is iskall85.
💮💗🌟🌠💙👙🎄✨🌠✈💮✈🎋💮✈💮👙💙💙🌙👙       *Because of  love. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Three days later. Rose him  from the dead.*   *Now. By Jesus Christ alone.

That scene brought me to tears
1:15 Things that you don't slide down in fear for your butt and your life
Frodo, Samwise, and Legolas  - together again.  This! This kind of nonsense. This is why I watch Hermitcraft.   Two Brits and a Yank, not minding the gap. 😂  Mumbo might've been permeated with the smells of ancient dust and European exhaust, from his bike trip, but a surprise shower from Grian, the moment they were reunited was just rude! 🤣 At least let Pearl handle decontamination procedures on the server. I mean, Mumbo already nearly breaks his hand, crouching. What'll it do to him if he starts going around, sniffing his armpits all the time?  Actually, it was a really nice "Welcome home!" Mumbo will never forget his shower experience... I mean, experience shower.
the grian face u made worked u summoned grian
rocks
i love how mumbo just acted as if he has been constantly uploading and he hasn't been gone for 9 months lol
Welcoming Biden on Hermitcraft is a thing for the centuries! 💡🌚
And in next week’s episode:  Hermitcraft 10: Biden Joins the server
Why was I so frustrated to see mumbo NOT scrolling through his tools to repair them while all that XP collected....lol
1:11 They’re called “jangly-doodle-wonkers” just so you know.
I have a strategy for X's game...just answer a random number every time...
The fact that your lvls after the exp bottle shower got to 69......NICE!
69 levels - nice!
13:22 it was lag 100%
E
I know this may sound bad or sad, but, the next person on HC I said Techno.
Btw a tip Mumbo, those creeping vines will keep growing till buildheight, so once you decide they got too tall, place some string on top of them lile people would do with bamboo/sugarcane/…
1:17 They are the stairs for the higher class (Mumbo) that are above those of the lower class (Grian).
I was crying and the cinematic scene. o7
I can't wait for President Biden to join Hermitcraft and prove Mumbo wrong. 🤣🤣
For next one on Hermitcraft i would have answered Gronkh, just to make Xisuma thinking about proving me wrong. Reverse Psychology and such. :P
That slow-mo was perfect
Does anyone know what the music was that was playing in the ending sequence?
Needed chariots of fire song there.
PRESIDENT BIDEN
mumbo i heard the skulk sensors from ur build while mining i am not a happy chappy
10:18 asdfsfdssddaf its the funny number!
The last shot needed a uprising sun and a biiiiiiig heart :D
Mumbo's level after all that time was nice
Mumbo there are called “two straight lines,” no?
Banister shmanister. Those are called hinges
Can't wait to see Joe Biden join the Hermit craft server
Mumbo Jumbo can you please make a 7 by 7 letters to door so I can build it in my world
مافيش احلى من قرآن الكريم مين معايا
1:59 everybody expected something else
That ending scene tho💀
if you want to stop the twisted vines you can shear the top block
The 3 amigos back again.
I was grinning from ear to ear watching that last part. It was so sweet <3
missed opportunity to play chariots of fire at the end
Mumbo: don’t tell anyone Comments: GRIAN GRIANNNNNNN
Hi mumbo I haven’t watch many videos of you but I already love your videos and I’ve seen you in grian
this is just butifull
I really want too see the recording of scar and mumbo dieing.
It was so good to see a Mumbo Grian interaction! These always put a smile on my face.
The strips of wood next to your entrance staircase are called aglets. There was a whole Phineas and Ferb episode on them to bring awareness to it.
amazing entrance for the three of you. I'm entranced
I believe the sides of the staircase are called Bananasters. You’re welcome!
i searched up out of curiosity "how tall is mumbo jumbo" and it said 98 feet
Nice video bro 💯
Such a nostalgic ending
That staircase rim is called the  ballast, because it helps port you to the door!
The sides of the staircase are called the anti-child-self-remover
Love the cinematic ending! Great work!
Scar instantly dying in the reuniting clip is so scar of him
Mumbo videos make me beyond happy
Railings
10:24 69 levels
That reunion in the vault gave me Sahara meeting nostalgia. And then ending scene was pure friendship perfectly captured. Great to have the chaotic duo of Hermitcraft back together again!
13:57 Yes....No That was hilarious
Really glad to have you back!
Mumbo is just so rich he needed to give the other hermits months to catch up
During Xisuma's game, after he asked "how many questions can you answer incorrectly in 45 questions?" I said purple. I had assumed the game had started already.
This made my heart happy.
What a great video. Just flat out loved it. The 3 musketeers (or is it muskrats) back together again.....wahooo
Grian did red stone in Mumbo’s base before he did 😂
The fact that this is #8 on trending just shows the impact that Mumbo has had on us all. It's glad to have you back Mumbo, I'm glad you're doing better!
My 3 fav Hermitcraft homies are back together .. yep all is right in the world again 🎉
Has anyone animated tge question game yet?
hi mumbo i have a cool server you should give a shot
69 lvls of exp… NICE 🎉
supremely satisfied that u ended with 69 xp
Mumbo’s levels when the XP finally stops…. Nice
So nice to see Mumbo back on the Hermitcraft along with Grian.
if you want some different colors, orange complements cyan well; you could try acacia or unaged copper. or not, looks great as it is, just very blue
To be honest, Scar dying just made that scene more natural and consistant with everything the three of you have ever done together
That ending scene was beautiful. :) glad you got your groove back!
WE NEEDED THE CINEMATIC REUNION AND WE GOT IT :D
hey Mumbo. an idea for keeping grian  out of the vault is to put some kind of timed item code lock inside the entrance to the base, and to also use the bridge as some sort of pitfall trap. you've probably already thought of this, being the redstone master and all, but these are my ideas.
69 after the exp bomb… nice
I like the vine tree things :)
bro couldn't keep all those levels for a single episode
It’s not baliters it’s bumblebee
Why don’t the wardens spawn?
This made me so so happy, I'm glad you guys finally saw each other again (:
They’re called stair shields
Oh Mumbo~ I just saw Grian's video and he used Redstone~    *also he may or may not have extra dragon eggs he's willing to sell, don't tell the others*
Somebody please put Chariots of Fire over that slow motion clip lol.
President Biden!
There backkkk
When Mumbo mentioned he might be able to move the whole door. I want to see him use the create mod to move the door and have it open like a Fallout Vault
That was lovely
let's go Brandon
if you can get Biden as the next member of hermitcraft i will personally hand you 1000 usd
the fact that mumbo-jumbos levels stopped at 69 just adds to the insanity of the reunion tbh
Nice...
poor grian, you had run out of stuff he could steal
10:30 nice
President Biden for Hermitcraft 2023!
69 Nice
The last part was very cool
imagine after that super cool ending, just the sheer depression montage that could've been there of the previous failed attempt with plans of Scar slamming into the wall how funny it would've been. Glad to see you all reunited at last, really heartwarming for some reason :')
Mumbo's lvl when Grian's xp bomb finally stopped. Nice.
What could go wrong? We're just running towards each other!
I need the president AI when Biden tells trump he’s joining the hermit craft sever and trump get upset.
We all knew he would have to break in as soon as something was changed haha
Those things along the side of stairs are of course called ballistas
"UHHH PRESIDENT BIDEN!" [proceeds to watch the AI presidents play minecraft videos]
seemingly endless xp blobs: *stop on level 69*      nice.
Anyone noticed Mumbo's exp at the end of Grian's party?
How does that button work, it doesn't seem to be directly powering anything?
Top notch bromance
smashable
How long before Mumbo removes the shriekers?
Happy ever after was amazing
I think you should make a diamond beacon in the center of the vault, the beam in the middle will really help with the square vault and the tall vines. Also a vault should have a large pile of diamonds in it and you certainly have plenty to spare
you made a vault, right next to grian, that opens via button great idea  the ending scene was great though, and the fact that scar died to elytra the first try is so terribly on-brand
the cinematic made me cry actual tears
Ai Biden will be the next to join hermitcraft
That ending cinematic had me with the biggest grin on my face. Reunited at last! 😁
So happy to see you've got your mojo back and enjoying making the videos again! We've all missed you
I’m laughing so much ahha good to see the three back together at last
That ending was so cute 💜💜
I say short vines
They're called stairsy  side bars
Never thought I would hear the day that Mumbo jumbo would say president Biden
Their joy brings me joy 🥹💜
They're called boullions
somehow i knew his xp would stop at 69
1:15 I think that's called a Chobblesome?
cant wait to see president biden on hermitcraft
Grians xp rain stopped at the perfect level… nice
This is beautiful. Mumbo's break helped us all realize never to take them for granted. Grian's separation to have him back was something only a true friend could have. and Scar, well, Scar fell from a high place, and that was funny.
This has to be the most wholesome episode of Hermitcraft ever.
Jesus loves you and his coming back soon give you’re life to Jesus Christ don’t ignore everything you’ve seen in 2021/2022/2023 turn to him before time runs out.  The signs are there for all to see so don’t harden you’re heart and resist the holy sprit turn to God   Jesus payed and died for you’re sins so you could be justified and be made blameless before God and escape what we all deserve for our sins our spiritual crimes   Things are getting pretty crazy in the world and it’s gonna get a lot more crazier and worser so please don’t  run away from God   trust God and run to God and receive Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour   God bless

Hurts me that he didn’t mend his tools with all that xp lol 😅
A stair railling?
So good to have TreeMan back
next episode "Joe Biden has joined the game"
mumbos xp stops on 69 ... nice
Day 2 of asking Mumbo Jumbo do educate camman18 on redstone
😘👌
Yay, grain.. XD doing his normal grian things an stumbles in via touching every things
clouders is what they are called i think 🤔
Can’t wait for the Joe Biden and Mumbo colab
it's spaceship time wibbley timey wimmy
Wasn't there a deal or challenge for grian to break into the volt?
Mumbo the type of guy to imagine has moustache irl and invisibly twirl it while thinking
10:23 it ended at 69.... *nice*
I would change the blue banisters on the staircase to deepslae to make it math=ch the rest of your build
Mumbo: /builds/ Also mumbo: if m not a builder
Me in 10:25 when Mumbo ends at level 69:
I'll never get used to that font
Please help me, can't seem to figure out what the song is when they reunited, could you please tell me what it's called?
I swear if joe Biden shows up in the next season
I really want to see a replay mod edit of the first attempt at the cinemtic reunion, like a blooper reel. Also, I want to see Scar's slow motion flight into the reunion!
The interaction with Grian really made me smile its good to have the boys back 😁
I'm not mad at you for opening the door again. I'm disappointed with you for not doing it 5 more times
Hey Mambo I've been watching your channel for years now and I had seen this door design and I actually liked it so I had decided to take your base design and improve it if you'd like to know more information on it contact me
mumbo's experience finishing on 69 🤦‍♂
Please someone edit ceilings by Lizzy mcalpine over grian and Mumbo running towards each other
Aww what a sweet ending scene
How do you make that wall door thing? Because I saw that you made a double piston extender, but I’m trying to re-create it and I’m not doing so well…
xp stopped at 69, nice
69 levels from Grians greeting... Nice.
Welcome home, Mumbo!
1:13 - Wrong answers only? Bannisters. Definitely Bannisters and not Balustrades. Definitely. You know good and well Balustrades are the verticals and Bannisters are the horizontals Mumbo. Honestly, and you call yourself an educated man *tuts*
Beautiful absolute wholesomeness
Alternative scenario wrong answers only: "Where is Grian?" "Um... at his home?" "No... he's... RIGHT BEHIND YOU." *cue music, tears, laughter, hugging, random death*
I can’t wait for sleepy joe to join
Can't wait to see the Bidenator on Hermitcraft!
Lol, the server is so laggy. Those honey blocks just showed up in his inventory.
The ending cinematic shot literally made me cry. I'm glad to see you three back together again :)
I loved that end scene SO MUCH, it truly was a perfect ending. Edit: Mumbo should add more of those cinematic shots in his videos.
oh gosh, the entrance is so nice!
10:09 mhh... nice
Pesident Biden AI might join Hermit Craft HELL YEAH
That was beautiful, tear’d up with happiness
I'm so sad he is not in limited life
Mumbo! I just thought of something that I haven't seen anyone ever do with redstone! Take the self building nether portal video you made. Make it move into the distance until it impacts a cliff, then build the portal and light it. Copy this design and send them in different directions to set up your nether portal network around the world! I can't find anyone who has done this. Be the first! Before someone else reads this comment.
@Mumbo Jumbo you should make a contraption that releases xp and make it enough that it's around you for the whole episode and never runs out untill the ending of the episode 😂
"I'm entranced by entrances" said MumboJumbo.  Me with a dirty mind-😨
Hello. (Sorry if my English is not up to par. I just started learning it last week. Please forgive me and tell me if my greeting was not correct. I'm still having trouble with my grammar. I thank you again for your kindness and understanding.)
you should with ur exit from ur base make it so a little slime block comes from the ground so u dont take fall dmg
4:26 aaah president biden got me cracking up
the utter happiness beyond description in grian's voice when he reunites with mumbo is just the most wholesome thing.
12:48
But where’s ISKALL???
I comment to help statistics
Tears welled up on my eyes seeing the slow motion meet up. The world is complete again❤
Can a talented person please make an animation of Grian screaming at Mumbos upload
I feel bad for iskall getting left out always
They call bannister
These item's gliching into Mumbos inventory are getting out of hand.
Epic Vault! The slime block launcher was genius
These three bumbling idiots together again is what the world needed ❤
19:26 AMAZING AND SO WHOLESOME AND HEARTWARMING!! ❤❤❤ three hearts for 3 of them, 3 for 3!
Xp stoped at 69
they're called Lannisters
i missed you.
The emotion at the end, it’s getting me all excited for when I see my best friends again next month 🥲
I'm so excited for biden coming to hermitcraft
Time is so short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message and receive it  do not harden you’re heart and resist  As you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will ever go back to normal my friend the answer is plain and simple no   you may say well friend the Pandemic is over I would say did the trouble in the world stop there ? no we’ve had 2020/2021/2023 and it seems as though things are getting worser and worser and more intense  And right now we are currently on the verge of a full scale war breaking out Israel is about to go to war with Iran Russia Ukraine USA and china all these nations and more are all on the verge of war   We have famines predicted worldwide for 2023  the World Bank has even predicted a global recession for 2023  we have a hunger crisis predicted a fuel crisis predicted a price crisis predicted a everything crisis predicted at this rate   How much more does God have to do to get you’re attention when are you gonna realise that you my friend are living in the last days and in the last biblical generation before Jesus Christ returns ?  how long are you gonna keep covering you’re eyes and ears and ignoring reality and truth ? You need to wake up and see what’s going and understand what’s going on TikTok is not gonna save you YouTube is not gonna save you you’re money you’re Job none of that can save you only Jesus Christ but you have to humble yourself and seek him  God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much already that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me and this world ? Is God warning me and this world ? YES he most certainly is warning you because he loves you and God is about to finally bring judgement on this sinful generation that has perverted the truth and has rejected Jesus    My friend God is patient with you Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved that is the fathers will that is what God desires for you truly for you to be saved and to be in heaven during this time of judgement  Today and even now is the day for you’re salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour   God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you and paid for your sins you can either accept what Jesus did for you or pay for you’re sins yourself and the price for sin is death that’s eternal Separation from a holy and righteous and just God  God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God we’re all guilty before God but God loves us so so much that he made a way for us to be saved and justified before him and that’s through Jesus   Jesus is coming back to take his church out of this world you must you must ! be ready and pray to be counted worthy to escape all that’s about to come to pass and come upon this world   friend receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today God bless ❤️❤️❤️  John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Your break really did what it was supposed to do! I think i speak for everyone here but, we can tell you’re enjoying making videos again. Great to have you back!❤
the train tracks 1:10
The crazy duo back at it 😜
i like the long twirly things
somebody please make an audio AI Biden episode of Hermitcraft
69 levels exactly... nice
There called ender grian
Why did I almost start crying when Scar, Grian and Mumbo where running at each other
If you think Grian won’t push that button, you are a fool
And then they all died. Not the Steven Spielberg ending.
1:16 Shoes
I for one am excited to see another Joe debut on Hermitcraft.
I just had the biggest cheek cramping smile through this entire video. Welcome back, Mumbo.
1:10 the skateboard slides
8 seconds in and I'm already beaming.  Good to have you back mumbo
10:22 it ended at 69 lmao
Grian: you're back! Stand here while I bombard you with broken glass!
Mumbo: “AHH I don’t have an elytra”  *elytra immediately popping out of his inventory*
The xp lvl, lol
They are called Stair Sideburns.
”What do you normally do when I’m gone?” “Wait for you to get back” Grumbo reunited❤
#6 on trending! Congrats! 🎉
the are called rasgers
10:22 Nice!
The twirly things work bro, you’re good. 2:15
POV: me checking the comment section for Mumbo’s Lvl69
Did anyone else also say Biden when Mumbo did?
Old platformer style transition from grass to 'path' :D
yippee
nice level you ghot there 😏 min.10:40
Mumbo,grian and scar reuniting was the most wholesome thing I've watched this whole day ngl...... But I really miss iskall though
oh man HOW MUCH I MISSED MUMBOOOOOOO NOW ITS JUST ISKALL, I NEED MY BOYS BACK
can’t wait for biden to join hermitcraft
yes *silence* no
10:22 Nice
Banister? it's obvisouly a banneaire
I swear Grian is going to be a jumpscare in the fnaf movie.
Who all said Joe Biden when he asked about the next member of Hermitcraft. I find it odd Mumbo and I said the same thing!
I was so sad when you died and lost 70 xp levels
I think they are called the sides of the staircase
it would've been hilarious if scar went all Hot Guy and shot you 😂😂
The Three Braincells are back together. Brain startes to work again! yay!!!
Bowling alley bumpers :)
AWWW YOU CANT DO ME LIKE THAT, THAT END SEEN AAAAHHAHJ
Puts secret button in plain view of Grian’s base…
So so good <3 I loved this episode, it was so happy and cheerful. I've been watching you from 3 years and it made me tear up today to feel like I've grown with Hermitcraft season 6 to today🥹❤️
THAT WAS SO CUTE
I think that was the single most beautiful thing I've seen this year 😍
that last scene made me CRI 😭🥹🥺
:)
Grian and Mumbo summoning each other in turns was hilarious 😂😂😂
10:10 Nice
I really want to see the replay where scar dies
The exact second grian appeared I got a notification for his video😂
That action shot was OP.
this sucks
LOL this was the best epidose evr i love this
never thought id cry at a hermitcraft video but grians excitement was so sweet :(
14:30
10:22 The fact that it stopped at 69 is hilarious
Glad to see you back Mumbo
The honey blocks just lagged in your inventory dind’t they Mumbo
If you just say some random word as all the answers to the question it will probably fulfill the condition of being wrong
Leave 'em tall!
Mumbo I think the door whould be way cooler if you add the same system as your potato badman cave
Oh man is it good to have Mumbai Jumbo back. Missed you brother
Mumbo has been watching those deep fake videos of presidents playing MC xD
You know... it's almost that time of year again.... Is the Hermitcraft egg hunt going to be a thing again? Mumbo egg vault?
GO BACK TO BIKING
I now watch many hermits and have since season 7. Mumbo was the very first hermit I saw so it was odd not having him around. Glad you're back! (I think I commented something similar on your last episode, lol)
why screams in base
Loved the ending! I like the staircase design, but it doesn’t feel “heavy” enough in front of the rest of the vault. Maybe incorporate some dark/black elements in the staircase? Black stone walls or something?
i quite like "twirly things" they give more life to your base. But what would i know im not a buildery person
That was amazing! Just wondering, who else was looking at all that xp coming in, and then at the durability of the shovel?
i love when mumbo doesn't have oxidized cut copper then has in a millisecond
My cheeks hurt from smiling too much! I need to watch it again!
"on the topic of smart buildery stuff.... twirly things" Mumbo Jumbo 2023
the experience levels was planned 😊
Enchanting-shaming mumbo 😂
What a happy episode! It's so infectious!
How to win 45 second wrong answer game: keep saying dog until he says what's your favorite animal
XP stopped at 69...😳
I just LOVE IT! My favorite pranksters and my favorite smart idiots reunited!
Hey btw grian reuniting with mumbo kinda feels like when your best friend comes to school after being absent for two days
Oh i think they are called stair arms
It might sound very bad and stupid but I don't know why I just wanna see mumbo and grian kiss   I really don't know why I have this urge💀
8:10 PULL OUT UR SHOVEL
10:22 Nice
Eat your cereal
Headliners next to the staircase
Ok Mumbo. Time to remove the shrieker. For real
Can someone make a deep fake of Biden joining HC? Lol
No, because what was that new black screen font???!!
My cheeks hurt from grinning, the trip is back and reunited!!!
That whole video has me grinning!
10:20 Nice.
the xp was glorious to stop there
Is mumbo playing on his laptop? 'cause either he is using a very big chat size, or his screen is very small
Grian cheering for mumbo coming back to hermit was adorable as heck
You better get proven wrong about President Biden joining Hermitcraft in some way
Love that ending. Missed that trio so much😃
I think it's safe to assume there's going to be alot of chickens magically appearing in and around your base.
10:21 Nice XP Level ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I’m sure it was spoken about already, but, imagine HC with the create mod lol
i love the combination of film skill and minecraft here LOL !
time to get biden on hermitcraft
100% that button is already wired up to a trap by now
They are called stair slides
Grians excitement at you coming back is the best reaction <3   And those "guard rails" out front are called fishfins
the cinematic end actually making me tear up :') so happy fou you to be back Mumbo!
Grian should've played Pigstep
Can't wait for president biden to join the next season of hermitcraft then
the "movie magic" stuff at the end felt really special. you should do more stuff like that. vault looks great and the door is super cool
8.6million, Mumbo. Not 2million. 😮😢
I know its not the best episode to write this but the sculk sensor (this that detects u walking) can give out different redstone signal depending on what youre doing. Could be cool to make the entrance to the vault a bit more secured...
I really like the vinethingies
ONLY 3 SECCENDS IN AND HAVE A HEADHACE
I like the warped vines Mumbo
this was freaking beautiful
this is amazing
Hey mumbo I got an idea for the highways name, I think The Skywalker Slingshot pass that on to grian would you?
I Love mumbo’s on-the-stair-savers
I think they're called barristers.
Don't forget that Grian never paid you for failing the decoy vault a second time!
So it's great that you're all together again but can we talk about how you made a vault entrance that Grian would find almost everytime he crosses the bridge.
Honey and slime flying mashine door could maby work for the door?
coming up next: Mumbo the troll... :D  Also: It is kinda reassuring that the man himself has no plans whatsoever regarding his season 9 experience going onwards.
They’re called bodgeneers
Damn, didn't realise it was a whole 9 month break
The xp got mumbo to 69 levels. Nice
Ending was a 10/10
It's absolutely wonderful to see you all back together!
i love how grian sets off a whole celebration complete with music and scar is just Late. to be fair though he’s been here the whole time waiting on his friends to return
That ending scene. 🥰😭
Wait! Hot guy, Cute guy, and now handsome guy!!!
I love the tall plants, I think they frame the base really well. Adds a sense of mystery.
Mumbo and grian are giving me mcqueen and mater vibes
It's been said, but that ending scene tho
7:49. Mombo sweared and cut it out. Gotta check grian if it is on his side
They are not called borders, they are obviously trampolines! 🙄
10:00  Grian: “hopefully you missed me”  Mumbo: *zooms in on his crotch*
When xisuma asked least favourite nickname i said tree man aswel
8:00 that screem have given given me busted eardrums lmao
I left longer, to be fair.  Not because I stopped liking you or the other Hermits, but I lost interest in Minecraft.  You get full credit for bringing me back into Minecraft.
Sleepy Joe moving up in the world
the side things are called bumblebees
Can't wait for good ol Joe to start a war with Grian next season
Of course grian gives him 69 xp
looking forward to President Biden joining hermitcraft ;D
honestly you could just answer quesitons incorrectly by just repeating nonsense <:b i'd just keep repeating the number 2 until it's supposed to be 2, then i'd say 3, and then if it becomes numbers, i'd say E, and so on, it'd be boring and i'd be a spoilsport but its their fault for not being smart enough !!
hello
The end scene was honestly so wholesome. Glad to see everyone back, and I can't wait to see what shenanigans you and Grian get up to now that both of you are back! :DD
I love THEM TWIRLY BITS
That scene was soo gooood
Mumbo you can build a warped vine farm like a bamboo farm and you can also add a dispenser with bone meal to make it quicker. I think this is the only machine ive ever designed myself and it works great.
How the XP exactly stopped at 69 🤣
Are you joining limited life?
Mumbo, it’s a Vault.  With dark and creepy green bits and shriekers.   How do you not go gringotts train trolley?
Mumbo doesn't know but he's learning
Pranksters assembled!
Can't wait for president Biden to join hermitcraft!!
This is probably my favorite hermitcraft episode you’ve ever made it’s so sweet :)
Mumbo and Grian are like Beans and toast.
There called rice bowls
Grumbo ❤️
1:15 ravioli
One reason I find this funny is that's what you see people do... In romance movies
Its honestly a good thing that that scene wasn't at sunset because that's symbolism for an ending but this case is more of a new beginning.
i'm so happy they are so happy
If you are looking for things to do, Grumbot has a content generator
Mumbo, I think you should trim the stair case in black stone, that might fit better with the build. Idk, just a suggestion, love you tho.
mumbo get exactly level 69 with the random experience bubble that grian used. so its already giving a little sign
And then they kissed
Architechs are back together!
TREE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DON'T BREAK THE VINES THEY LOOK COOL
Idea: When opining the Vault Door from the inside, a despenser on the bridge temporarily ejects water for you to fall into so you aren't taking fall damage every time you drop down.
3:18 Doc transcribes Mumbo 😂
That game with Xisuma makes me want to create a POTUS skin and see if we can't get Biden on Hermitcraft just once :D
Mumbo's exp level stopping at 69 is poetry
I can't wait for someone to use the Biden voice AI just to make mumbo's answer right.
Check the amount of levels Mumbo was left With after  Grian surprised him🙃
4:52 all you had to say is "im sorry, i cant awnser that"
X: Who’s the next person to join hermitcraft  Mumbo: PRESIDENT BIDEN
I think Scarr slamming into something would have made it even more real lol
The ending scene is so wholesome and dramatic it made me jump in happiness and have the biggest smile.
It's great to see you're back in Hermitcraft!
when you are answering questions incorrectly just say 1 everytime
Listening to the wrong answers to the xisumas questions on repeat 😅😅
Can’t wait for president Biden’s mega base
69 xp mmm
At 3:17 doc said okay too 😅😂
Mumbo speak to Iskal he think you hate him :(
Day 1 of geting mombo to give me a shout out
Beautiful.. ♡   If we can just ignore grian pushing his reunited friend off the bridge at the end
I never thought a mincecraft slowmo would make me cry. Missed the chaos trio content mumbo. Glad youre back <3
&&*((::}{_+|||”:?>+___)
I forgot that you mastered redstone, I pause every time you explain the designs, I cant comprehend LOL
It’s so sweet and nice how they all miss each other so much!
Grian and Mumbo have the ultimate bromance
That episode is pure joy :) Gonna rewatch it when I need to cheer up
Oh my God scar dying on your reunions shot and then you dying right afterward it's just perfect
I'm so glad grian is back that break he took felt like ages
Bumbo Troll
The fact that mumbo is getting better at building while grian is getting better at redstone makes me satisfied
Mumbo it is killing me to know how you did that button to activate the stair boost could you show how to do it in the next video
I love how mumbo is trying to make a safe and secure base and grian just gets in and turns it into a lush jungle!
Mumbo, Grian and Scar reunited again. Summer must not be long because THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN (the boys are back in town)
Nice
the. best. ever.
Beautiful 😢😢😢
Love how the exp stopped at 69
Tall twisting vines must stay.
most wholesome hermitcraft episode
Mumbolio Mayonnaise Jumborino The Third.
This was extremely chobblesome
that ending scene was awesome but just to let you know mumbo, in replay mod you can move the sun around to where you want it
69 noice
Nice
Grian screaming "You're back! :D" was the most heart warming thing I've heard all week
the ending :')
Doc at 3:20 saying ok with you and X like he was there. Perfect hermit timing. 😂
Am I the only one that hates the fact that Iskall isn’t with them? That would’ve been so perfect.
10:09 nice
the way the xp stopped at 69 lvls 💀
Is poultry man makin a come back?🤔
Fades to black scar whispers.  Right guys I’m off for a few months now 😂😂😂
I would have answer all the questions with bananas.
Mumbo telling us not to tell anyone about his secret button Also mumbo: *shows it in his video*
omgosh new mumbo vid! me and friend always race to spam each other when your videos come out! just so excited!
the gang is back together whooooo
2 million? Mumbo, you got nearly 9 million subs XD
Mumbo's XP level after the reunion... *Nice!*
Yaaaaahhhb wooooooooo, so can grian still break into your vault? Like a t the beginning, cuase right not he might find it very easy, yet very pants
did any one else see the levels stopped at 69
Grian: "MUMBO!" Mumbo: "GRIAN!" Scar: "and me too!"
Finally, inner peace
theyre called stupid stoppers not banisters pff
You answered them incorrectly, which was correct according to the instructions.. so did you actually answer them incorrectly?
There is nothing more them than scar dying while they doing anything. That for me was the most genuine reunion.
The content you're producing now is worth the wait I'm glad you're back and feeling good again and I hope you don't ever fall in the same situation you did where you felt you needed to one up your videos everytime because for me personally the colabs with others are the best like my favorite moments of you this season is by far the first episode with scar dying and this bridge scene and that's just for the laughs you don't need to be good at red stone or building to have that style of content so to me you don't need to one up yourself just throw a bit of stuff like that in every now and then and I'll be very happy or just being a spoon is also great stuff but thanks for the great content
a tip from me (who is not a builder at all XD) : try to mix the oxidized copper with some almost oxidized copper to add a little more color
xp gathering ended at 69 NICE
You could just make the door open by using slime block and honey block flying machines
You should booby trap every single button that doesn't open the vault :)
Now that end scene was just adorable
EYYYYYY
Mumbo, why don’t you activate the door with sculk sensors?
Those things on either side of the staircase you were wondering about, well they were originally invented in Germany, they're called "fällenshtöpperz".
😀😀
I haven’t actually smiled that long and wide for a while. Very wholesome moment 10/10
As a builder who doesn't do redstone this video / base has given me heaps of ideas for  how i can make pretty builds but hide redstone inside of it!!!
8:20 this is the best moment in video and you can’t deny me otherwise
Biden would kill the server's economy in less than a week.
Perfect ending scene
Sus 10:22
Mumboat
Infront of fellow hermits you should click buttons in a specific order to make it look more complicated
10:26  69😂
If you want I can build the inside of the vault ( I specialize in interior design and architecture) I’m 13 but I’m not young!
10:29 it really stopped at 69 💀
Wow, that cinematic shot gave me goosebumps! So happy youre back on hermitcraft mumbo!
10:27 EXP=nice
18:45 IM CRYING 😭😭😭🤧🤧🤌🏻🤌🏻
8:05 Grian screaming sounds like a horror movie monster scream HAHA
off topic but stained glass half slabs would slap
His levels stopped at 69 lol
What Mumbo should have said for how does redstone work “It doesn’t”
that thing at the staircase is called a slide
🍇🍇🍇🍇🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆.
That ending was cringe
69 levels 10:40
its so wonderful how you managed to make a minecraft shot so silly yet emotional at the same time, I'm just so happy to see the squad reunited :,)
Confirmed Joe Biden is joining Hermitcraft
that ending was beautiful
17:15 looks like scars superhero theme "where is scar?" *scar majestically and menacingly flies towards the camera* *scar bumps into a wall and dies*
I’ve had such a big smile on my face during those last few minutes when you guys staged the reunion, the joy from all of you just shows so clearly, I love it and I’m super happy that you’re able to play together on the server again. ❤
Whos cutting onions? That scene woooah 19:00
Mumbo's Mustache Vines looks like his Vault is brimming with Mumbo's Mighty Mustache.  Btw Mumbo, if you want them to be stuck at a certain height, just put a string on the top.
10:20 nice. number of levels
I'm not crying, You're crying!   I also like the wiggly things, Mumbo, keep them
We say “Railings” in America
1:17 arm resters
I so wish mumbo is in limited life too
69 nice
That was a heartwarming welcome back action!!! <3
And now that's the kind of ending we were waiting for Its wholesome
And now that's we were talking about - Mumbo
I’m so happy Mumbo is back at hermitcraft!
I legitimately cried at the end there come onnn
3:51 what if you come up with a word that could never be the answer (for example: Zimba)
I don't know why... But Mumbo leaving reminded me so much of 'Banshees of Inisherin"
Grian and Mumbo are the greatest duo ever! Thats the kind of friendship people should aim for.
BIDEN LETS GO!!!! can wait what sort of law the president will implement
I love you guys sooo much!!  I'm so glad you're back mumbo!
The ending scene made me so happy, I've been catching up on all the hermitcraft goings on as well to celebrate your return and i'm so excited you're back <3   also the border banister things are actually called bollystoggers fyi xD
1:20 Those forsaken paths that we took as children. That's the name of the stairs' borders
It seems the easiest way to cheese that game is using the same type of answer to all of them, like "zero" and then just follow with random numbers.
Haven’t played Minecraft in a decade but I still enjoy watching people play it I’m glad I stumbled across this channel a year ago. (Context I’m 24)
President Biden next hermit confirmed
That was beautifully done boys.
The presidential bros join hermitcraft
HE'S BACK!!!
The world feels whole again when mumbo and grian are reunited!
Biden Gaming
putting string on the swirleys stops them from growing
finally after all this time grian returned, hes been gone too long l.
Did anyone notice his levels stopping at 69 haha that got me smiling
<3 them <3
algorithm
Woooooooooooooooooooooo🎉
19:25 I'm not crying you are 😭
10:29 Nice
I been watching horror movies my whole life. I've seen ghosts throughout my whole life and I seen one demon as a child. And the shreaker block is the one thing that actually scares me
I kindoff wished iskall to come from the other side and the camera pan was from the top
BANETER
I seriously thought Scar was supposed to smack someone out of the bridge when on his elytras 😭
Hermitcraft s9 is 1 year old
Not 2 but 7 million
Love how the xp rain comically ends at 69 levels
THE BOYZ ARE REUNITED :D
Couldn't stop smiling. The bois are back together again
Would deep stone blocks look cooler instead of the smooth stone blocks?
The XP stopped at lvl 69, JUST PERFECT
make a bounch pad for when you exit the base so you don't take damage
I guess biden collab is canceled
And in the next season President Joe Biden joins hermicraft
That was a fun episode lol. Also there is something slightly ominous seeing Doc in the chat with "I am in your storage room" lol.
that cinematic was so perfect, it's so good to have you all back together <3
8:05 Grian: YEAAAAAGGGHHHHHGGGS grian’s noises are gradually getting more chaotic lol
I actually did a fistpump when the xp stopped at 69
Those shreikers are gonna gwt annoying fast
Perfection Mumbo. This video is perfection
The Bromance between those 3 <3
<3
69 levels. Grian that was an on point gift. Mambo we missed you, glad that your back
My stomach hurts from laughing, this was great!
So his favourite nickname is Treeman? Got it
18:18 The subtitles call scar a police car
can you retroactively use shader in the replay mod? because imagine that with a really good shader
Petition to get president Biden in the server
I'm glad mumbo is enjoying himself again
I was wondering… couldn’t the launching mechanism be simplified by just avoiding the stairs going down with the slime block? Like wouldn’t an immovable block help with that??? To avoid the hassle and the piston noises (I haven’t really worked with sticky blocks though so I might be saying something dum)
That definitely should've had Chariots of Fire playing in the background
The band is back together, let the shennanigans begin😂🤭🤫🤗
Grian's joy when you arrived inside the vault was priceless :'D  Also I love that both of you forgot how grian lost ANOTHER TIME entering the vault while you were gone and still owes you like 6 diamonds blocks X))  Great video!
No, they're not banisters...  they're handslides😎
10:15 it's so satisfying that it stopped at 69
THE TRUE TRIO ARE BACK
Bruh i just got a mobile game ad for a fake Minecraft and they low-key just used your video for it
wait hang on, grian is getting eggs. i wonder if poultry  man is gonna mysteriously return?
For future reference, Tango has a honey farm next to his starter base in a little greenhouse. He won't even notice, since he has too much anyway and is stuck in a Decked out hole.
Plot twist: Mumbo wasn't showing the right entrance to fool us from telling Grian
Is no one gonna say “Nice” for 10:10? Allow me to be the first.
pp  utdgvjrdyveth
From now on, I will watch this episode everytime I feel down ! It's so good to see you back together on hermitcraft !
Best ending ever
Why am I getting emotional about the Grumbo reunion
Mumbo uhm please rethink your middle block so that the gutter minded people don't get a laugh everytime they think about your experience level lol
Is it weird to have goosebumps when watching three people cross a bridge? Cause I had goosebumps. Good editing :)
69 levels, NICE
ahhh grian and mumbo interaction. the serotonin
10:27  nice
Mumbo Is back!!!!!😭😭😭😭....
Staring at Mumbo's shovel while all that exp just goes straight to levels 😭, could be mending
Now this!... this puts a beaming smile on my face
They are called chairs
Sure, make a "secret button" to secure your vault from the man who compulsively presses all the buttons.
Technically, the "borders" or the side of the stair case you built are called stringers!
Now all we need is Iskall and Stress to get back from Vault Hunters and everything will be right with the world!
I miss @iskall85 in this video 😭
1:16  They are called Stairs
man I can't believe Joe Biden will be joining Hermitcraft
You made a BUTTON, the one thing that Grian can't get enough of pressing, your opening mechanism for your SUPER SECURE VAULT. MUMBO!
i like the tall twirly things tall too
I wish Trump would join hermitcraft
Yes I did make Minecraft
I never thought I'd cry watching a Hermitcrtaft episode. This was glorious
69 levels, nice
we have issues 4:43
For the love of god thank you for correctly saying resident biden will be the next hermit.
the amount of joy i had from the exp stopping at 69
Grian + Scar + Mumbo = GriScarBo Trio  Unless there's a better name when combining those 3 names
That kinda felt like clickbait, but still its so good to see them back togheter. The amout of shenanigans that they are gonna be now is just amazing.
10:15 landed perfectly on 69
if you waterlog the skulksensors, they don't make a noise at all.
(subscribe to Mumbo!)
Damn I've missed the guys!
When Mumbo was on the underside of the bridge his mind immediately went: *Troll*
1:17 they are clearly called "falling on the stairs stoppers"
Balanadabertsers
What happens if I play death metal over the reunion scene
I like how mumbo stopped his xp bar at a very tactical level.
Same
MFW GRIAN AND MUMBO 🥹🥹  IM NORMAL IM NORML IM NORMAL (<— lie)
So wholesome. So glad!
Grain and Mumbo back together, everything feels complete again. It just felt like something was missing, you know? ❤But I'm glad Mumbo got the break he needed; as much as I love his content, I'm sure it wouldn't feel right forcing yourself to do something you would ordinarily love.
This once Scene in the Bridge where you we're running towards each other has so much fanart potentioal
That was beautiful ❤
10:22  By the time the XP finally ran out Mumbo had 69 levels on him... *Nice*
Awesome Episode! Nice to see you reunite with your firends so vividly! Also very cool door :)
do they film these sober
Can't wait to see Joe Biden on Hermitcraft!
the fact his exp stopped at 69 is amazing
Can you make a video where you design a system to open that door in a test world. The whole thing, as small as possible. Sounds like an interesting video.
Okay but why is the cinematic show the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
And thats why Youtube contest creater are awesome. Think of all the smiles and happy faces this reunion of real friends in a Video game has caused.  Thanks mumbo
AI voice videos have convinced me that the solution to all of America's problems surrounding political division could be solved if Biden and Trump would play Minecraft together
I can't wait for Scar to hear Mumbo say the words "screeching crevice", LOL
grian engineered it so mumbo is 69 level
Happy. Happy. Happy
next please make tutorial! farm changer! so if you need a melon farm you press the melon button the melon farm will show up! and if you need a bamboo farm the melon farm will go into the ground and the bamboo farm will show up! (without the create mod)
i love how the xp stopped at level 69. Nice!
That cinematic ending was stunning.  So happy to see Grian, Scar and you back together.
Maybe make the entrance of the vault open by throwing a netherite ingot into a hidden pocket of lava. Only the rich can enter this vault
Still bugs the shit out of me the whole “idk where the diamonds came from” bs  lol ugh it has to be a joke!
HE IS BAAACKKKK!
I've been waiting for this episode for a while. Also, that episode where grian lost his stuff trying to break in, still gives me a hearty chuckle. He really didn't think that one through.
They are called walls
Why did you zoom into Grian’s crotch when you told him you missed him?! 🤔 😂
10:20 Nice
I'm so happy... like the ending WITH Scar !!!??? I umm was holding back tears
So awesome. Loved the warm ending. Glad your all back ❤️ together.
Put a slime block under carpet so you don't take full damage.
Where isn't Grian Right now? "working on the back of his base"
The ending of this video feels so surreal having friends be together once again after so long. It made my eyes get watery. What a terrible day for rain.
10:00 Grian: "Hopefully you missed me..?"  Mumbo: "Yea, No, I also did miss you as well" *zoom in on pants* "...obviously" *zoom back out again*
10:39 nice xp
WAFFLEDUO REUNION IS LITERALLY MY NEW FAVOURITE THING THEY BOTH SOUNDED SO EXCITED
Naaaaaah grian glazing frfr💀💀💀💀💀
The lvl 69 was prefectionnnnn 😭
biden for hermitcraft 2023
gives megamind ending vibes :)
3:18 doc becomes mumbos subtitles
What are the coincidence of mumbo's EX Level stopping on the number 69... weird
In episode 7 you afsked for our favorite moments but I forgot to write it, so I thought I would just do it now. Anyways, did anyone tell you about the generated content by Grombot, there ware some pretty funny moments with that, but I think it is better if you ask Grian. Btw it is great ti see you back!
69 Nice
Brings tears to my eyes😢
my strategy for that game: “twelve”
I hate that YouTube hasn't been showing you in my Subscriptions nor giving me notifications you've uploaded. I didn't even know a new season started!
So glad you're back mumbo, and that endig was so beautiful!
baristas
This is such a classic hermitcraft episode. Grian messing with Mumbo in a secret meeting room, Scar dying, Grian and Mumbo being awkward and messing up.  I really miss Iskall on hermitcraft as well, Iskall mumbo and grian were such a trio. if he comes back this could be a quad now with mumbo grian scar and iskall
Even hermitcraft is Now talking about politics
Oh gosh I love the cinematic XD
I don't know why the ending makes me cry but my god I am in tears <3
10:00 'well hopefully you missed me, too'  'I certainly missed you'  *zooms in on crotch*
The ending was so glorious!!!
The "President Biden" part just made me remember the AI made conversations between the presidents that happen in games in general
Could you imagine if Iskall logged in directly at the meeting point on the bridge? Now THAT would be an intense reunion
Lvl 69 omgggg
The “banisters” are actually stair sleeves
the soft smile on my face as you guys ran, is my everything.  welcome back mumbo jumbo
I didn't tear up, not at all 😭😭😭😭
grian literally screaming when he sees mumbo is so wholesome
That ending scene needs some iskall tho
look at his XP level at 11:03
Now we need to Summon iskall
You can limit the growth of vines and bamboo by placing string on top
I am awaiting the President to join Hermitcraft now
AYYY MUMBO CURRENTLY 2K VIDEOS IN TOTAL!!
So funny, loved that ending. The slow mo was to die for!
MY GUY… WHAT TOOK U SO LONG. Glad ur back. NOW UR NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE EVER AGAIN. Just kidding. I get it, it can be hard…
Level 69 nice
they are called bumfoffers
There a tear in my eye
YES LEVEL 69
I find it funnier that he decided to not swap the amount of slime and honey blocks considering how he had to acquire the honey blocks.
7:57 honestly this was so cute
So beautiful
Me:   Mumbo, Mumbo Mumbo!!!
missing @iskall85 );
Grian is so golden retriever and Mumbo is so Jumbo, and i love it
oh the fan animators are going to love the bridge scene
Bros back together,  you love to see it.
We neeeedd iskallll!
Mumbo: After a bit of bumbling around  My brain: Mumbo bumble
GET MUMBO INVOLVED IN ANVIL WARS
10:27 nice
Can't wait for President Biden to join Hermitcraft!
I don’t genuinely laugh out loud at YouTube or really anything electronic, but 17:25 I genuinely bust out laughing
You three always put a smile on my face
Couldn't you have just placed obsidian under the stairs do they didn't get grabbed?
I'm so bad with time, I didn't realize you where gone for that long.
The things on the side of the stairs are called balustrades
The power of editing. Just loved the last scene :P
Grian’s party for Mumbo was just the best 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should connect the vault door to a skulk sensor.
Best Edit Ever?
commenting so more people see this video
Yay! We have our 3 halves of a whole idiot finally back together again!
They are called beds mumbo those things on the sides are beds 1:13
Mumbo iso backo
69  Noice
4:30 i also said biden for some reason and i find that hilarious
Call ur vault kgoomr2
I actually really like the, um, the tall blue thingies? whatever the f*** they're called.
that was such a beautiful cinematic.
Now we just need iskall back!
I feel like the Bamboo aren't obstructive but using string  to limit their height at heights you feel best suit the build, that would be good. That way you can choose just how much of the bamboo you want to show in your build.
Uoy evah 96 level
I love the grian and mubo bromance
Bro become children
Mumbo, you reminded us all with that ending scene, just how much of an amazing Cinematographer you are!!!
That video title is sus... Not sustainable 😂
11 Hours Ago  *Terraria Celeste Slimerancher Man*
Scar being late and then dying is far more accurate tho lol
It looked like they would kiss here for a moment 😂 19:29
This is why  scars name is good times with scar
5:27 the one misplaced stair hurts me
Mumbo I hope you changed the door activation off camera.
You need to do the warped wood in your base but don’t strip it. The wood adds color and textures you might like
That ending was so wholesome 😭
The word you were looking for is "footguards"
10:40 The number of levels NICE!
that grian scream 🤣🤣
Now watch him swap the slime block launcher with a pitfall into lava.
"How does redstone work?" - It dosen't
2:11 I like it 2! You should keep it!
It was truely a cinematic scene at the end
That was the most amazing ending every. Brought tears to my eyes. Some happy tears, some from laughing because of course scar died on the bridge!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biden is not Mumbo's president, neither is he mine. We don't live in the US.
Mumbo!
Your reunions with Grian and Scar were so wholesome (ignoring or in addition to the scuffed moments, i can't decide)! It makes me so happy to see you all together on hermitcraft again
Truly a cinematic masterpiece
The fact that the enchantment points ended on 69
He said President Biden! THAT MEANS SKIZZ IS STILL IN THE RUNNING!!!
Now we just need iskallMAN
I hope your bidden prediction is right. I support the guy, but I think that would be funny.
At the end of the day the best part of Hermitcraft is the friendship!! Glad you guys are back!!
The entrance to Mambo's bases slightly off-center to grians bridge
I love the vines, I have the same around mine
I'm might be 19, but nothing is better than getting back from the gym with the bois and putting on hermitcraft. Reminds us of our childhood
I love the level mumbo landed on lol
Hi mumbo i love ur vids i have an idea of smth can do with the inside put like tons of readstone around you base with like glass tunnels with items being transported in
That was amazing too see you all back together especially you and grian and the added bonus of scar he really did miss you mumbo
That ending scene was surprisingly well done.
This was a MASTERPIECE🤣🤣
69 levels
Thank you for this, duration was perfect - gosh dang it got late quick :D
I’ve really missed grian scar and mumble
Reunited, and it feels so good!
Never did I think 2 Minecraft players running to each other, & 1 more flying in with an Elytra, could be so beautiful
Can’t wait to see Sleepy Joe on Hermicraft
Mumbai just turning his volt into a superhero cave with that entrance ❤🎉
So happy to see our chaotic trio officially reunited! That ending shot was beautiful. And seeing Mumbo’s base come together is so satisfying. Can’t wait to see what the future holds
Iskall in the Conner. 🥲
There stair blocks.😁
Now if we can just find out what happened to iskall.
Grian, Mumbo and Scar are Hermitcraft's Ross, Chandler and Joey
You were afk for a long time Mumbo im suprised no one stole your mustache
1:15 stair coat
The friendship between Mumbo and Grian is priceless!  Bromance at its best!
Wow, a cinematic masterpiece at the end there! I got emotional 🥺👏🏼
That ending!
Nice
I will never get sick of hearing mumbo say screeching crevice
10:23 nice
Hey am I only the one who saw him use the creative block picker in survival  this happened around 1 min into the video btw
Ah the bromance
Seeing Grian and Mumbo interacting for the first time in a long time was one of the most wholesome things that I have ever seen. Good to have you back Mumbo!
Those thing on staircase are known as bread
Scar dying and then Mumbo dying was classic.
Beautiful
This episode makes me so happy...but now I miss Iskall
Welcome back mumbo!!!!
Mumbo’s not the richest person until he gets 13 bamboo
I can tell that grian’s going to make a video soon! And I can tell what it’s about😂
mumbois the main character on hermitcraft
the lag is back
You should do a boys trip now in hermitcraft
What did I watch ???
Mumbo ending on 69 levels.. nice!
10:28 dmn tht xp rain was perfectly calculated to make mumbo at the perfect lvl lol
Mumbo great idea is every second stair put a sea lantern in the place o strip wood to give some light and some depth.
Level 69 nice
Mumbo-jumbo  I'm so happy you are making videos  again  you are the reason I play this game your videos taught me Redstone and made me love minecraft
The trio is back together :3
10:28
I was so ready for scar to shoot both of them, ruining the cinematic reunion
The lag is back!
Omg I love the ending scene and grian being so happy to see you is so amazing ❤️
honestly, you could cheese Xisuma's quiz thing by saying the most random words possible
I love the twisting vibes. If you like to look at something, and it gives you comfort, embrace it. Others will follow. It might take time, but others will embrace your joy.
xD, that look on mumbos face when not only did he find grian was in his base, but he had built a bunch of dispensers that just shot bottle after bottle of bottled xp causing it all to rain down on him, that was pure gold, then the aftermath of having a bonanza of level ups that went on and on, that was a nice touch XD, I have to say, grian outdid himself lol.
Ah, those are the bumbling stoppers of course!
i loved that ending so much more than i thought i would
i was so sure scar would just snipe you both
do the animation in 3rd person next episode pls
Welcome back Mumbo!!!
If you were grian in the questions...  and you were between grian and mumbos base... would the last question be correct or incorrect?
10:19 Nice! ;)
Grian says eggs The time has come  The time has come The time has come  The time has come  🥚 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚
I haven’t smiled this much in my life. This relationship is my favourite. 😂❤😊
I’m glad you’re having fun, Mumbo.   I hope you have a reunion with Iskall one day too. His absence has been looming over the server but somehow with you back it’s gotten even more palpable.  Anyway, do you plan to partake in TCG? Your rare card is super OP. It would be awesome to see you build a devastating Prankster deck (Grian and Stress are the other two Pranksters).
Mumbo mentioning how Minecraft characters do the splits when they walk had me laughing for a solid minute.
XP ended on 69 (nice)
if the create mod was in Minecraft somebody would totally have a full railway system.
love to see tree man back on hermitcraft
BUT WHY ARE THEY FLOATING 😂😂
9:23 the Xp stops at 69
Wow. What an ending! 😍😍
That ending was absolutely perfect, I honestly couldn't have imagined the three of you reuniting in any other way than by causing some form of chaos 💛 welcome back to the server Mumbo, you've been soarly missed.
This episode had me grinning from ear to ear!
Biden and trump are joining next season
Only if mumbo’d stumbled on for a bit longer in the questions then he would’ve succeeded, it was around 44 seconds when he failed
After the levels finished Mumbo ended at level 69 and 5 groups of 4 adding to 20
yo the end got me in tears
those are the slides on the sides of most staircases.
i was waiting for when grian realized the vault was complete and thus raidable
So glad mumbo is back
Biden confirmed to join Hermitcraft.
Mumbo jumbo we missed you but i have to tell you that you don't have jumbo on account so is it for story or not......  Read it like a song
i cant wait for biden to come to hermitcraft
Wrong answers only on the staircase thing? "Barristers," probably.
The reuniting was amazing, but just imagine how much more amazing it would be if Chariots of Fire was playing in the background while Grian and Mumbo were running towards each other!
"Who is the next Hermit on Hermitcraft?"  Me: yes Mumbo: President Biden
the ending is like the icing of a cake perfect
I'm not crying. You're crying. 🥲
They're not banisters, they're handrails
Round of applause, very well done, see you at the oscars
I think those are called Thingy Dingy Side Hoppers
"What is your superpower?" "Uh, armpit smell" I'm trying to not wake my family 😂😂😂
tbh i thought all the hermits would have a reaction similer to grian when mumbo came back.
i had graduated high school and gone into my second semester of college before mumbo started posting hermitcraft videos again
15:23 2 million people? Uh… i see 8.6 million people subscribed to you Mumbo…
level 69... Grian well done!
The ending was so good
lvl 69
I am "Chaft to bits".
Welcome back Mumbo! 🎉
What are the requirements required to join hermitcraft
Everyone left mumbo alone on hermitcraft 😥😣
Mumbo knows about President gaming
Grian should show mumbo his launcher
I'm so excited for when Biden joins hermitcraft
Everything is so wholesome I'm crying
Ok, but having the Geriatric-in-Chief on HermitCraft would actually be hilarious. You could just give him some food items and watch him wander around the landscape trying to sniff Villagers' heads while wishing they had hair. :D
Eggs
:D
A very nice amount of levels you got there, after taking a shower with Grian...
The ending made me smile so wide I looked like a madman
Biden for Hermitcraft!! I only say this in hope that Trump too will push to join Hermitcraft during his election campaign and we can see what type and design of glorious wall he builds
that ending scene tho!
HE RETURNS
Can't wait for Biden to be the first president on hermitcraft
I like the blue vines, could be bigger though
The vines look very silly mumbo
Hehehe… 69
That first attempt perfectly summed up their relationship
Very nice
...nice
That last part made my day.
Getting the Gang Back Together...
Absolutely glorious
I want the bloopers!!!
i feel like he has the shriekers there to just see how long until the entire audience turns against him for making them listen to the shriekers constantly
They are called basilors.
10:30 noice
I wanna see a mumbo and iskall end raid
I loved this!
AGHHH GRIANS SURPISEEEE 😭🛐 I'm actually emotional what
Mumbo, Grian and Scar reuniting had me in tears and with a warm feeling in my heart simultaneously. THIS is the most beautiful friendship <3
♥️♥️♥️  Love the friendship these 3 have
I was trying to play along with Xisuma's game, and when he asked "where is Grian?" I said "right behind you"
10:02 "I did miss you as well" **Zooms in on Grian's crotch**
between episodes switch the button that opens the vault, add more buttons to your base, adn add (non destructive) traps that activate when pressing the wrong button
Love the ending scene!
Mumbo if you need some ideas on what to do for videos go see Grumbot “Prime” Grian has turned him into a content generator.
WICKED ENTRANCE
Yaayyayayaay i was excited for the next episode
10:30  experience  nice
President Biden is actually a minecraft veteran so he would make a good new member of hermitcraft server
0:44 vsauce moment
honestly liked the scuffed version of the scripted scene it tracks so well scar crashes and dies mumbo falls off and also dies wish that had slo-mo as well xD
Can you do a joint video where you both help eachother with your bases with the style and redstone and another vid. Make each other a hell house they have to complete in a new world. Thx so much
President Biden. 😂😂😂
Is there nobody else notice that mumbo's level experience stop going up at exactly 69?
One of the best 😭
Those are the bridge's shoulders.
Railing
easily one of the top 5 best and most iconic trios of all time
The ENDD!!
The best ending ever! It just wasnt the same without you Mumbo. happy you are back!
I missed this. I'm glad you had time to refuel, but I'm so glad you are back and doing fu things with Grian.
the superior trio bsck again  !!!
Don’t fallie wallies (aka banisters)
they are called coke canisters, you put them on staircases
Loved this!!!
Grian and Mumbo are so wholesome
When he wanted the wrong answers you should have done 5 or bob for every answer... and you would have gotten them all right.
The name of the thing the side of the stairs are called uwu tacos no joke
the things on the sides of stairs that you run your hands down are called cheese graters
How fitting that the first thing he said to grian was basically “what is this what’s going on wtf”
For X's game I would say: Water Water Water Water Water Water Sand Water Water
Is it bad that the ending made me cry? Nah, I don’t think so. Glad to see the boys back together. Fork Knife and Spoon trio has never been better.
Not president biden ☠️
I like the swirly string things
I think the word you were looking for is bucket
I believe those are called anti-wibbly-Wobblies on stairs  Thank you very much
it feels so weird to be watching my first hirmt wid since sesion 6 and its the one you also come back on
That end made me teary eyed ngl
Guys... The Grian Shrine Worked
His xp number after the party😂
Half a million views in 8 hours...
The screeching crevice is both the best and the worst name he could have come up with
I'll write this comment as I watch through the video. 1: The things on the side of the stairs are called railings. 2. I think that the "twirly things" look good as long as their not higher than  the build. Maybe put a string on top. 3. The Grian heads on the spikes were freaking hilarious. 4. When exactly did Grian break in?
Mumbo you should start a server with the other content creators where the create mod is included!
those "twirly things" actually look really good when their tall
What a shot👏🔥
you should keep the garden look for the interior.
Finally the boys are back!
genuinely brought a tear to my eye to see the boys reunited again! I'm so happy to see you return man!!
Grian: Attachment Issues Scar: Attachment to Death issues Mumbo: detachment issues
I'm a very private person. Meaning I don't like or comment on ANYTHING but that reuniting slow mo at the end was truly delightful. Thanks Mumbo, you truly are a legend
Tbh, wd u back mumbo, i also got the enthu to restart Hermitcraft again
The wholesomeness of the moment when Grian and Mumbo finally met up again was so nice.
13:58 The Yes,No crack meup so hard i dunno why
10:23 yeeeees 69 levels of green bar, nice
Guys it’s confirmed joe Biden is joining hermitcraft
Mmmmuuuummmbbbooooooooo!
Now we just need iskall back!
I couldnt stop smiling the entire video ... welcome back mumbo !!!
“President Biden is the nest person to join hermit craft” I’ve very excited to see what the next video is about 😂
Nice😉
the xp is so perfect timing
The ending really got me thank you mumbo for making these amazing videos all those years.
cant wait for bidencraft to join the hermits
Just Hook the door up to a slime-and-honey Flying Machine! Duh!
GANG'S BACKKKJK
Someone is missing in that reunion.....
Thanks to deepfakes Biden is an avid player in the Minecraft community
Can't decide if its the Three Musketeers or the Three Stooges...
if you want this to look more intimidating. you may use soul fire
Stairs, they are called, stairs.
can't wait for bidenator in the next season, love his build style
"Who will be next to join Hermitcraft?" "Uhhh ... President Biden!" Lol, wrong country, Mumbo 😂😂😂  Also, the ending, sometimes I forget they are supposedly grown men😂 I love these three so much.
After Mumbo cuts down the vines and says "What an absolute dream", I want to say this from now on, but I know it wont be the same because I'm not British.
I like the tall twirly things
I dont understand how two of the stickies  blocks dont stick together
I derive great pleasure from watching the other hermits on Hermitcraft, but when it comes to the true essence of Hermitcraft, watching Mumbo is what does it for me. I can't quite put my finger on why, but that's just how it is. I must say, I'm really delighted to see Mumbo back on Hermitcraft. Welcome back, Mumbo! Watching your antics always adds an extra level of excitement and entertainment to the show. And speaking of friends reuniting, where is Iskall85?
Alright we milked the return enough. Now let's actually do something
How I imagined the bridge scene would play out: The camera cuts between mumbo and grian as they come closer together in slow motion, then when they're getting close to meeting up, the camera switches to scar who is standing perfectly in the middle of the 2, and Mumbo and Grian both kill scar together.  This would signify the reuniting of friends, as well as scar's tendency to die in the weirdest ways.
The Video Tittle should be: A wild grian broke in..
Yes - Grian made exactly the sounds I imagined him to do
So I guess that means that the grain/mumbo summoning circle actually works
Yo, the ai presidents all joining hermitcraft would lowkey go so hard
I was so happy when the XP stopped at level 69 lol
Seeing grian going wild when realizing mumbo exist in the hermitcraft after a crazy long time is just made me feel good.
Joe Biden watching this video: "aw man :("
That scene should be studied in Cinematic Universities
69 levels from xp, nice  @10:20
nice
Everybody: I’m so happy Mumbo is back! Me laughing at how his xp level was 69 11:32
Ah so the vault failed
I just got a transphobic ad bruh :(
Mumbai has become so much more of a builder thanks to last season, and it really shines through on this build.
beautiful.... just perfectly beautiful
The thing about those Twisted Vines is they act as ladders.  So whether or not you decide to keep them depends on whether or not you want people to have roof access to your vault.
just quit bro this os not good, i'm not a hater, quite the oposite, focus on what you want to do, this seems forced'... and it's not cool ro like it was before, rly just my opinion, I hope i am wrong but i dont think so
make a hypnotic door so everyone else can be entranced too
15:01 OMG THAT IS JUST, PERFECTLY SMOOTH
Mumbo, that was beautiful. Literal tears coming down from my eyes in slow motion as well ofc! Welcome home, our mustachioed man. ❤
Xiuma: “who will be the next to join hermit craft?” Mumbo: “PRESIDENT BIDEN” 😂😂😂😂
All reunited ...  yeay! Now, TCG when? :))
King ren failed, time for mayor mumbo, make grumbot proud so he stops ripping holes in time and space
I might seem greedy but we need a reunion of team sahara after this
So I just had a thought What if you made the screamers or whatever those blocks are at the bottom of your pit go so far down you barely hear them so that they aren’t annoying but are still noticeable.   Then make some kind of a red stone clock so that they are constantly screaming.   And your end result is a cool looking dark pit that’s endlessly screaming to add to that cool dark look.  Got this idea after hearing the scream in the beginning of the video
Nice
We now need Biden in hermitcraft
AAAAAAA I LOVR THIS SO MUCH:(((<33333333
Please take P. Biden maybe he can do minecraft. Hes screwing up the USA
I love your videos!
The ending was absolutley BEAUTIFUL!!!
I cried with this episode!!! Very touching
Its good to see you guys together.
Epsode 9.....
That was truly cinematic
the XP levels stopped going up at 69 lmao
Who made Minecraft? Peter.
My first thought when he said to give the wrong answer to all the questions was "Just say beryllium as an answer to all of them there's no way that will be correct."
That ending was so incredibly wholesome.
Why the xp stopped at 69 😂
This is Cinema! Mumbo Scorsese on that final scene.
Thank you for coming back
What about Iskall?
18:50 Oh my god this brought a tear to my eye XD 14:36 this whole bit of you pressing the button and going into your vault so smoothly and seamlessly just proved to me that I’ll never be able to do redstone…  At least I can see such amazing redstone builds from minecrafters like you <:3
Minecraft needs stair and slab variants of all the mineral blocks, including copper. And some kind of brick, stair, slab, and wall variants of concrete and terracotta.
10:28 nice
Grian's sheer joy at Mumbo being back is the greatest part.
this was the cutest thing ever
Dang after that shot I'm gonna have to say I watch for the cinematography
I hope this video gets 2 million views
Mumbo is at level 69.
the side of a staircase railing is called the sidehuggers
Stopped on level 69. Nice.
That was awesome
Bro why did the xp stop at 69 AHAHAHA
I really like how the blue twirly things look grown up around the base
The secret entrance is good and all but the access point..... One of your biggest friends and biggest rivals - Grian- can't ever stop himself from pressing random buttons. Whether this season or another... Thinks back to he was the cause of the whole Rift adventure. Jokes aside, glad your back and amazing reunion of friends at the end
They're called Ballerinas, Mumbo.
Can't wait for President Biden to join next season 🤩
Well I wasn’t expecting to cry today, but that cinematic reunion + the music stirred up some emotions 🥹 The gang is back together and I’m so happy for y’all! Thanks for bringing us such joy, Mumbo ❤
Such an amazing episode, thanks for deciding to come back to Hermitcraft Mumbo. I think I speak for everyone when I say I am happy and excited to see what shenanigans you will get up to, especially with the whole gang back!
yes.........nooooo 🤣
👍💞👍
so... all that scene was missing was a VERY confused Iskall standing in the middle of everyone, wondering how the choices he made in life lead him to be there!!!  Welcome back Mumbo!!!
YIPPEE 🎉
69 levels. Falls to his death looking at scars corpse.
So cool!
I was cheering like a redneck at a football game when mumbo was getting his xp.
Shops sold out because all the owners too busy playing card game XD
Mumbo: What could go wrong? We're just running towards each other!  10 seconds later: *Two of them are dead*
I'm chaffed to bits that you're back, Mumbo!
69
Great, I've been working for months to try and get Biden on the server and you're telling me it's not happening.
"Joe Biden"  I'm excited for season 10
Bro why am I crying at that scene
10:22 nice
Hermitcraft Dream Team is reunited and it feels so good!
Stops at 69
Can't wait for president biden to join hermitcraft
Where is Iskall?? :(((((((((
Scare dying. Mumbo falling. Grian being confused. Not the cinematic reunion one may have dreamed, but to be fair nothing could have been a more fitting reunion for that group if they had planned it.
That cinematic shot was great but the first one went pretty much exactly how I thought it would
Incredibly excited that Joe Biden is joing the server
After seeing Biden play Minecraft on TikTok I think it’s going to be interesting
😂
Next hermitcraft member is biden
Finally the mumbo got his jumbo back
GRIAN BROKE IN...        in a good way! :D
The moment we were all waiting for!
I've been known to say "entrances" like mumbo did when i see it in print
“Who will be next to join hermitcraft?”  “PRESIDENT BIDEN!”
Joe Biden is the next hermit craft member???🤨😮
13:24 surprised the devs haven't fixed this glitch yet, Everything is somehow glitching its way out of Grian's storage system.
17:11 why does this remind me of that scene in Madagascar where Marty and Alex are running towards each other xD
Probably could have done some slow falling potions and got a similar effect
that reuniting scene is everything I imagined LMAO omg i love it
I've been sick all day and this certainly brought a smile to my face! What a wonderful episode and the ending scene <3 reunions are important
Nah the xp really stopped at 69
why are my eyes sweaiting
The ending scene is so cutee
Mumbo, you can waterlog sculk sensors to shut them up.
Xisuma: where is Grian Me: I was hungry
grian welcoming back mumbo gave off younger brother vibes. love it :)
The only thing that would've made the reunion cinematic more perfect was if Chariots of Fire was playing in the background
Blister
14:56 I can’t wait to see what pressing the button really does 😂
That ending was truly sensational
I really like getting to see Mumbo's cinematographer side in Hermitcraft.
Can you open the vault in third person POV?
when Mumbo in panic, he could only think of Grian which mean they actual share two brain cells
Ah, the crew is back together! (Grian fans, read this:) I'm really glad, boys.
I would compare the amount of diamonds to doc, I don’t think you would be thinking about being the richest hermit anymore
the only thing missing was iskall
Can we get the ending scene with some shaders and at sunset? That would be amazing! Love the video, glad you’re back! ❤
ending got me screaming, crying, throwing up
Me hoping and praying Mumbo's xp stopped at 69.😅
grian and mumbo are just such good friends and im so jelly beans about that
Xisuma after the incorrect interview:  Dear President Biden…
Mumbo :') it's so good to have you back, I've missed you so much
Anyone else thought that scar will Hawkeye them both in the end 😂
What a brilliant scene!
Totally grinning ear to ear
instead of the staircase on the bridge what about a redstone escalator
Hehe the levels stopped at 69
Cant wait for president Biden to play hermitcraft
I might have to stop watching Hermitcraft if Biden joins it 😂
I like the twirly things but you should put string on top so they don’t grow to big
You should make a decoy keypad or something.  Something that looks like if you entered in the right sequence of buttons, it would open the door, but does nothing but light up some lamps.
trap idea: you could put a decoy button on the vault door that pulls the floor out from under you and drops you into a pit of some kind.
I missed you as well! *zooms in on crotch*
Heh heh heh... 69
Mumbo's XP finished at 69.
Note for Mumbo: the lining either side of a staircase is the stringer. The top surface of the stringer where you would stick the railing into is called the shoe.
This was so wholesome, I love it
If you like them keep them Edit: gratuitous mumscarian reference
That ending was truly cinematic XD
10:21 NICE.    It made me smile to hear grian greet the returned mumbo
That was vary wholesome
would love to see President Biden on Hermitcraft Season 10.
All-righty-then 😄 👌 👍
I loved grains screams of pure joy as he saw mumbo for the first time in months.
It's actually very easy to answer questions wrong. Just say something like 'Pineapple' over and over. Always listen to what is being asked so that Pinaplle isn't the actual correct answer
So wholesome to see Grian give Mumbo some 69.
I can't wait to see BidenGaming join this series in Season 10!
They are Called Handy Bits!
I did not expect grian to do that lol
So glad you're back
The stair things are called buffalo wings, because buffalos are absolutely massive, and they wanted to make a railing that would allow them to comfortably walk along large ramps or staircases without falling off
the grin on my face is unreal its truly good to see you back
You could have answered the word ‘you’ to every single question 😂
You missed an entire goddamn crossover
Mumbo has been back for a few episodes now but only now he trully is back
@17:03 pretty much sums up these three xD
day 1 of waiting for that biden mumbo collab
4:20 PRESIDENT BIDEN
As tradition, there is no actual plan 😂
That cinematic was beautiful
Pov grian viewer: "we will tell other hermit of that button"
1:17 President Joe Biden
Grian wasn't supposed to have an interaction with Mumbo for another 4 years, now the space-time continuum is doomed
Wait so you were cycling for ten months straight?!?!!??
Jumbo got 69 levels!!!😂
Grian missed the perfect opportunity to bring back hermit challenges
I really want one of those Biden gaming shorts on hermitcraft now
Mumbo you need to make a code pad and never show it to us
Grian calculating the exact amount of xp bottles to bring mumbo to 69 xp
The ending was AMAZING 😍🤩
13:53 yes🙂… no 🙁
It would be cool to incorporate the beacon in the base somehow
Incorrectly doesn't mean close to, but wrong. For example, you said president Biden is going to join the server next, but I think that a clock isn't going to join it either
am i the only 1 that like didnt put together in my brain that mumbo was his username. I always thought mumbojumbo
How do you join hermit craft ?
Beautiful scene
Man I've miss rhe redstone testing world
Mumbo eggs
Eggs
Hey are you gonna be in limited life?
I couldn't stop smiling during the entire xp ceremony.   So good to see all of you guys together again!
If you need the shrieker to shut up, try waterlogging it! It might not look as cool, though...
The xp landed on 69 what a legendary moment
Handy graby slippy stoppers.
So happy the gang is back together!  Definitely a cinematic moment :) :) :)
With that ending moment, there is a smile pasted on my face. I am so happy you are back together. I'm looking forward to seeing what things you build, what contraptions you create, and what mischief you get up to together.
@1:50 "that Made me sound much more like a builder than I actually am" said mumbo while standing in front of the coolest base ever 💀
That was GREAT Mumbo. I felt the sentiment and joy of friends reuniting! Welcome Back.
X:"where is grian?"  Mumbo :"in my basement... oh wait thats right"
Excited to see Biden playing with you!
Don't know why exactly, but seeing Mumbo Grian and Scar reunited made me genuinely cry. My 3 favorite smart idiots reunited at last!
After all the “presidents play video games” memes, Mumbo’s response is perfect.
9 months later, [title]
Mumbo you owe us around 30 episodes worth of content
69 10:42
We’re missing Pearl and Impulse in the running towards each other part. We need Boatem again… well I need Boatem again
The 3 stooges arr back together
No offense Mumbo but it would be more clickable and enticing if it said he DIDNT break in haha
Mumbo XP level… nice.
They're definitely called banquettes
Not sleepy joe
Can’t believe thy replaced inskal with scar
it is hilarious that mumbos XP stopped at 69
15:04 you really wired it up to a BUTTON to keep GRIAN out!!!????!!
This is just an idea I think you should have a piece of paper saying get a free Redstone build personally from Mambo jumbo at the end
The fact that the experience levels stopped at 69 made me laugh for an extra minute or two after Grian and Mumbo reunited
8:40 that's satisfactory song... I'm hearing it everywhere... EVERYWHERE!!! i like it
No film beats the pure joy of reunion of these fellas, that was great
is it me or is the GUI bigger?
That cinematic cave me chills well done 👏
I’m sure I’m not the only one crying at the end…
5:50 - I wasn't following the videos and now I'm very focused on reasoning about the fact he's ignoring so hard the skulk... did he didn't notice? is the sound on purpose? is he ignoring to troll us all? in any case, it's being very effective...
Grian's shout of pure joy upon reuniting with Mumbo put a huge smile on my face.
I'm sure I couldn't be the only one who teared up at that ending scene!
The ending was too cute
Perfect picture❤
if grian doesnt make a intro with the scene he described on the beach im gonna put legos on public stair cases
That ending was amazing
Anyone else see the levels end at 69… 😏🤣
4:29 wow a special special guest loo
Welcome back Mumbo.
This is why I love hermitcraft so much
This was a beautiful episode
5:22 just say nonsense answers like what color is the sky? NO.
69 levels, nice
I love you Mumbo, so glad to see you back, the most chaotic trio reunited indeed
For X's game... just answer a number untill a number is wanted and then you answer a word...
Who will be next to join Hermitcraft? Mumbo:President Biden
im super happy ur back mumbo :D but remember the deal you made so long ago? you owe Grian diamonds
Not me crying at the end.
69 xp levels, nice.
10:25 nice number ngl
This is everything I could have possibly wanted
At first I was screaming at Mumbo to use the XP to repair his tools, but then not doing so got him to level 69 and I was absolutely thrilled that he didn't
Nice
I just watched bush’s beat the dragon on his single player and get 69 levels and now mumbled gets 69. I’m almost 30, but nice.
Nice
Those are called beacons
1:17 lawsuit preventers! (Any/all)
Love the cinematic
Ahh the pressure of a spontaneous quiz...  My solution would've been... X:  What's --- Me: *Cuts him off* Donkey! X:  Who -- Me:  Donkey? X:  When -- Me:  Donkey.
Chefs kiss on this video Mumbo, top job.  Great energy and absolutely hilarious. I know you already came back but it feels more official now lol, Welcome back.
15:15 Do it 1 more time. Do it 1more time . DO IT 1 MORE TIME.
Grian being happy that mumbo is back was the best thing ever <3
no 69 level joke dislike unsuscribed and for now on im going to start an unberably amount of Ponzi schemes
FINALLY GRIAN AND MUMBO MEET AGAIN
Yes! The xp stopped at that number!
The bridge is to bright against the wall
That felt like a foreshadowing lore
This is brilliant
That was nice. Both the ending and the xp.
hud seems weirdly big
XP stops coming in,  Me: Nice
THE BEAMING smile on my face during the entirety of this episode :D :D :D :D :D
Who tf is cutting onions 🧅
Mumbo's level 69... Nice
grian screaming 'YOURE BACK!!' made me so incredibly happy
That slow mo brought me to tears ❤
I just woke up and Mumbo giving me both dopamine and serotonin! That cinematic at the end was both hilarious and adorable! Thank u Mumbo!
the Grian meeting warms the heart
I know the end scene is mostly a joke.. but you're REALLY good at cinematography and I'd love to see little mini scenes like that in other episodes in the future. It's not really something I've ever seen someone else do with Minecraft.
I absolutely lost it at Biden joining hermitcraft lmao
mumbo is a troll
1:15 They're NoFallOfferers
This episode is pure serotonin
This video makes it abundantly clear that those two do, in fact, share a brain cell.
Nice
I guess grians mumbo jumbo summoning worked
Mumbo seeing the 69 levels and flinching not to say nice to keep the content family friendly is the best:D
1:15 They are called extended armrests for standing on stairs.
All I can see from the last 5 minutes of this video is the Hermitcraft version of J.D. and Turk's reunion in Scrubs. So happy to see the boys back together!
Mumbo got 69 levels 🤣🤣🤣
I kinda miss the Sahara boys too. Sahara get together when?
I'm so glad you took my advice and came back to hermitcraft🤣
Would've been hilarious if you just answered 47 or something like that for each of Xisuma's questions
In Xisuma's game, you could've just said the same answer every time: "What's your name?" "47." "Who made Minecraft?" "47."
it seemed like the game told him "Correct!" with the lvl up sound at 9:13 lol
You gave him 2 weeks mumbo. Ggez
Mumbo! you should have a slime block launcher that launches you over the bridges as well!
haha the experience ended at 69 LOL
They’re called stair bumpys
69 Levels, Nice.
I am so happy you’re back
That whole ending bit had me cackling. Absolutely amazing. Loved every second of this episode
1/8 of us have hit the like button. Thats actually extremely high. Gj peeps.
That bridge run at the end had me smiling like an idiot :)
The ending scene was very well shot 👌
We missed you mumbo ❤❤
you and Grian should be even more mischievous around the server now to make up for the quiet time ;)
can you imagine if that lovely reunion shot was just the end of season 9
the madman finally did it
Grain worked hard for those bottles! Appreciate his work :/
I can't wait for the debut of President Biden in HermitCraft 10!
The arrow block Supposed to be Used for Practicing bows  Redstone Users, Such as mumbo:  :)
Now it’s time to roll the barrels, cause the gannnngs alllll here!!! WOO! Friends reunited at last! Also that door is really cool O.O, might need a more secure door knob though to keep grian out, he is a notorious button pusher.
Door improvement suggestion: a Lever to unlock the system then a pressure plate launch into the doorway
I can't wait for Joe Biden to join Hermitcraft!
That cinematic shot was awesome. I had seen the Twitter post, but damn watching it in slow-mo was even more entrancing(hehe).  And then the jump-cut to the actual footage🤣🤣🤣
I'm so sad mumbo isn't back at life series lmao
😭
Is it bad I expected scar to hotguy them
I love this so much
13:24 hmmm… seems to be a bit laggy today…
So beautiful. So glad mumbo is back. Loved Grians little surprise party  I think the vines overgrowing can be pretty cool, but the height of them can be set if you place a piece of string above it!
is it bad I’ve spent 4 hours sobbing over that clip of them running towards each other….?   Oh to have friends like that, that you can leave for a year and immediately fall right back into place the second you see each other again
There's something so oddly emotional about the last scene, although I knew mumbo was coming back for so long, it brings me so much joy seeing mumbo and grian both being genuinely happy to see each other.
We in America call those things on the side of the stairs Sean
Putting this timestamp cause I might make an animatic 7:56
Mumbo: ~flicks lever~ Vault door opens. Walks out. Takes fall damage then says "That felt incredible". lol 14:29
15:50  2 weeks after the last time he tried to break in, he is now ready to try again.
Amazing and heart warming! Welcome back Mumbo!!
The xp finishing at 69 lmao
Keep the vines imo
What a silly lovely little man
President Biden 😂
I would really be interested for president Biden to join hermitcraft.
I love how Xisuma’s fiat two questions were “what is your name” and “what is your favorite color” just like the guy in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. They are ever on a bridge.
5:00 easy tomatoes tomatoes tomatoes tomatoes tomatoes tomatoes
this made me laugh and cry, everything about this was perfect.
hi mumdo love your videos
GET RID OF THE CHESTS BLOCKING THE ENTRANCE ALREADY!
Amazing
I love Grian's enthusiasm, he's a nut.
Engagement
Its so nice to see 3 of the greatest trolls. I mean Hermits. Back together again.
Looking forward to President Joesph Biden's upcoming announcement of his joining of the Hermitcraft group.
Grian sure knows how to make an egg-xit.
Screw disney, dreamworks, pixar, and any other animation company, the ending to this video outshines all other cinema.
THAT ENDING
I missed you Mumbo! I'm glad you took time to look after yourself and I'm glad you're back! I hope you gained the perspective needed to know that we have fun when you have fun and that this realisation just means follow your bliss and do your best to show us it. Bliss > showing it. Because it's you having fun that we want to see. Your filmmaking skills help you show it, and boy do they show, but it's the fun that we're here for. Keep striving to be better, but remember that it isn't the reason we're here. I hope this makes sense and is helpful ❤
Those things next to the stairs are called bulizimases Mumbo, glad I could help
The levels stop at level 69. That is a funny number
ngl this was the gayest thing I’ve ever seen
Mumbo falls off the bridge and dies, losing his 69 levels: nice.
Marvel could never
did u guys notice mumbo exp bar was in 69 when it was  finished
I love that the XP stops going at lvl 69
Epic
That brought tears to my eyes lol. So sweet.
Speaking of next hermit I gotta say BeardStone looks like he could fit perfectly... just saying
5:35 "Even if I could make it open - _which I probably could"_  Mumbo casually flexing on us non-redstoners.
XD the fact the the XP stops on 69 😂🎉
“The screeching crevice strikes again” 😂😂😂
Hi mumbo,I am one of Grian’s fans,don’t go away anymore Grian really missed you😂
This video was the wholesomeness I have been waiting for since mumbo came back!! I love the friendship between grian and mumbo! 🩵
WELCOME HOME ODYSSEUS!
10:25 that stopped at 69. Nice
1:15 mumbo im afraid it's called a "Banishment"
17:10 getting madagascar vibes haha
For all the questions, just answer "Grian" over and over.
President Biden LOLOLOL
Love it
11:32 look at his level XD
lag on the hermitcraft server strikes again, this time with honey!
dont you owe grein dimonds
That ending scene made me smile more then I thought it would. Even if we got all the behind the scene stuff. Even though i knew what was going to happen. I'm so glad you are back together. Missed you guys shenanigans ☺️
beware of president biden the next hermitcraft member lol
Spoiler alert: he got the Biden question wrong.
Hi
Somehow grian did some math equations to make mumbo’s xp level to land exactly on number 69 😂
You have 69 xp after grian bombs you whith xp potions
My first instinct was to answer every one of Xisuma’s questions with “beans”
Ayo 69 levels lol
waitin for biden in season 10
i love the look of the things mary poppins slides on, on the staircase infront of your base also i feel like grian and mumbo have really different styles of building, grian has a more natural look while mumbo has a more industrial look to it.
I really was looking for a comment left by Joe Biden... What was I thinking lol
Xp on six nine lol
The summoning shrine worked... AGAIN
“I did miss you as well” *zooms into Grian’s crotch*
it's good to have you back mumbo
What is the proper name for the medium in-between 2 bridges "Jeffery"
Both have no plans. The most mumbo-grian thing ever.
Mumbo got to 69 levels after Grian first showed up just in case nobody else noticed, nice.
Beyond happy, thanks boss
13:56  Me finally completing a Redstone contraption for the first test run and it working perfectly  “Yes”  Then tries running the contraption again, the second time, and it completely fails  “No”
I would love to see President Biden on the hermitcraft server!
The best ever
: ')
Mumbo has become a cleptomaniac
WOOOO
this video is amazing
Grian, Mumbo, and GoodtimeswithScar, name a more iconic trio, I'll wait.
Would’ve been far better if the steps were synchronised…come on Mumbo..
"What is your name?" "Grian" "Where is Grian?" "I don't know"
cant wait to watch biden fumble around hermit craft
This is the Episode I have been waiting for! For so long! So glad the boys are back together!
for some reason my brain immediately supplied an incorrect answer for "what is your favourite colour" that i'm quite proud of thinking of:  Left.
At the end i imagined mumbo and grian running up to each other and scar just falling to his death in the middle
change the button that opens the vault off screen and never show ur self pressing it
You can't trust the comments Mumbo
You need to make another 100 second 100 doors
Hey mumbo. You should use a hidden key card reader for the vault door. Using a hopper minecart.   You just need a hopper Minecart on top of a detector rail on top of a hopper with a comparator to the rail. When it ticks to signal strength 2 you use a sticky piston to pull the rail out from under the minecart.  And the hopper Minecart can pickup through a block so you can have it so nothing shows outwardly that it's there.
If you want to stop the vines u can put string on top of them so they stop growing
I can't wait until President Biden joins Hermitcraft.
Mumbo, why you're not in limited life?
Grian's reunion: Lag & deafen. Mumbo's reunion: Terraria Bridge Moment. Scar's reunion: Miss the timing, crash, die, and have Mumbo follow.
The ending was beautiful. lol
SHOW US THE FAILED ATTEMPT IN SLO-MO  PLEASE  PLEASE MUMBO
for your information mumbo, those things in the sides of stairs are called   'side stair splat stoppers'
that was awesome
Did anyone else hear SpongeBob and Patrick at 12:15? “What do you normally do when I’m gone?” “Wait for you to get back” 🤣
that was beautiful  I expect that moment to receive some oscars
Palistrades. They’re called palistrades.
10:18 nice
Finally the gang reunited😭 That was the most beautiful friendship moment I've ever seen in my entire life
stopped at level 69. nice lol
I couldn’t stop grinning at the reunion, it was just so wholesome.  Edit: And the cinematic reunion was hilarious.
69 nice
mumbo, please. You need fabric loader with sodium. Your fps is so low :P
You should keep the decoy vault there somewhere and have it be where the treasure is actually kept.  Remember, Grian is still meant to try and break in
I'm surprised mumbo hasn't been HotGuyed yet
can't wait for biden's first episode
What an ending! 🥹😭😭🥹
that must have been the best ending to a hermitcraft episode ever
Im not crying, you are
1:15 they're called asses........   Totaly
literally the spoon at 9:48
Mumbos Xp ended at 69
What happend at 5:50?
You guys should make a skyship and become sky sailors, no wait wait wait wait be sky pirates!!!
mumbo's redstone smooth jazz in the testing world. Don't mind my mind going blank when bass goes thud thud thud
Brilliant Mumbo... Taken to a whole new level... Redstone and cinematic genius....
Would have been funny if one of Docs creepers followed Grian out across the bridge at the end.
♥
10:25 noice number :))
Mumbo: borders  Me: slides for the brave
Grian sound so happy welcoming Mumbo back. lol
69 levels nice
The access to get into the vault requires a button press. Grian can totally figure that out.
We need an AI voice of Biden joining hermit craft
love how when he finally stoped getting xp it stoped at 69 lvs XD
I lost it at the bridge scene, good job mumbo, scar and grian.
The ending scene has me literally smiling so hard it hurts. It’s good to have everyone back.
Mumbo and Grian duo are back! 🎉
Idea for a defense other than door, have a button on the other side that instead of using slime launcher it pulls blocks out from under and drops them into a chamber with sculk sensors and screechers to summon wardens, actually try a sculk sensors instead to drop them down
Imagine having the urge to duel someone everytime you leave your base
Your piston door is quite similar to a sculk bay door design I made a few months ago. Glad to see someone using a different opening style.
Surprised you didn't ask grian to introduce you to grumbot2
Those splits tho…
Scar crashes into bridge & dis Mumbo yes I'm going to jump off this bridge without an elytra then realise 5 seconds later I have none XD
Next we need a mumbo and iskall reuniting scene! 😂
Xisuma: WHO SHOULD JOIN THE HERMITCRAFT SERVER??? Mumbo: PRESIDENT BIDEN!  That got me way more than it should have XD
Hiya Mumbo! What a wonderful entrance for your vault. I just don't know how to get the redstone to work with the timing, and distance that lever is hidden to open the entrance. It's just genius work. Your choice of a cinematic reunion will forever be remembered by the millions of fans of Hermitcraft. Thank you for the video!!! <3 ~respect
I'm so glad that President Biden is back on the Hermitcraft server!!!
1:13 crusts.
I love how Grian brought you back with the shrine, and you brought Grian back with the shrine
Grians xp potions putting Mumbo to level 69 ... Nice
"Don't tell anyone I have a secret button"  Classical mumbo. I mean, mumbo is like "Don't tell anyone my secret password" Meanwhile mumbo's password: 1234
Mumbo: I feel like this can’t possibly go wrong  *40 seconds later* **you have died**
You use a button knowing Grian is a person who pushes and flips every thing that moves or clicks lol classic spoon move
The Friends Reunited scene gave me Lord of the Rings vibes 🤣
The king has returned!! So glad to have you back home!
treeman: 🥺
Now we just need to get Iskall back!
i was watching all the XP and was hoping "please, pleaseeee stop at 69"
69
That panicked, quiet, "President Biden?" made my day lol
7:19 door tutorial?
Nobody really talking about Biden joining Hermotcraft
Now I want to see AI Biden playing on the Hermitcraft server
69 levels... Nice
Love the door but I reckon it should fling you through right from where you press the button. Stand, press, wheeee through the door. 😂
Time for Mayor King Mumbo
Noooooooo!!! The diamonds!!!
The edge of a staircase is called a buttress
Petition to get Joe Biden on hermitcraft
did this not happen a year ago?
the sides of the stairs are called walls
I just realized watching this video that Xisumas skin is the classic Doom Guy
aww
Soooo good, the cinematic scene!
i could watch that vault door open for 10 hours straight and not get bored of it 🤩
Nice.
That cinematic was... well, cinematic!  Gotta love the camaraderie.
You should build everything underground, like in your seasons two and three bases. It would add more as a vault idea
I saw that in Korean variety shows, they play this game, but the answer has to be absolutely non-sensical: the answer MUST have NOTHING to do with the question. For example: "What's your favourite colour?" Wrong: any colour Right: "Is that a bird?"
The levels mumbo got from grians exp shower, nice
Create a red carpet entrance
i cant wait for the out of context videos to come from the question segement with X, "who will be next to join hermitcraft?" "president Biden" 😂
One of the most chaotic pair of friends on the server are finally reunited!
If you ever want to stop the twisting vines from growing, by the way, you can just right-click with shears on the top and they will stop. I don't know if you know this already, but its a helpful tip if you decide to shorten them and want to not put string everywhere. :)  10:21 Also, nice. :)
FROM THE 4TH HOUR
"Showing it to near on 2 million people." Mate, did you forget that you have eight million Subscribers?
The party reunion made me tear up! That was so sweet! Sadly Scar didn't HotGuy you! Missed moment! Welcome back the 3 Amigos!
@1 min 15.  Abutments.
hm, what nice number of levels grian gave to Munbo
4:25 I was playing along and I said Pres Obama right before he said Biden lmao
This episode had me so chuffed to bits that I clapped at the cinematic ending with my hands and my feet.
Mumbo: "I am not a builder!" Also Mumbo: (adds a neat railing to temporary stairs)
The cinematic scene is actually better if Scar pulls a hOtGuY on Mumbo, making the scene become funny out of the blue
You can find pretty much anything You need at either impulses giant shop or pearls trash shop ( the one with the giant bin and bird on it).
That stair case is looking quite pants. . . Lol ah good times
I click this so fast lol
can we see the behind the scenes of scar dying?
Grian was just like how you would be if you haven't seen your best friend in years
The little game with Xisuma was hilarious XD
You are reunited and it feels soooo goood 🥲
I mean... if you have nothing to do, you could always start building decks in Beefs Hermitcraft Trading Card Game!
Seeing Mumbo so pleased with his Door just made me happy.
I'm so happy you're back Mumbo, and it's so great to see you and Grian again, and Scar joining in as well. That cinematic scene really warmed my heart! Thank you for this <3
You know you could have just said one word again and again for xisuma's quiz Like 'cake' for each and every question because technically it would be not correct answer
“Reunited and it feels so good” Mumbo it was right there bro
what a beautiful ending
The phrase you’re looking for is fish sticks. You said wrong answers only. 😂😂😂
Who else here miss the redstone testing world?
That ending scene tho (but with Iskall)
"We are back." Three weeks later the series ends via another meteor.
I love the entrances mumbo has been doing
Just got to the Grien bit and this is so wholesome
Yay I bet it felt good to see them
beanutputter
All that we really needed was all of them to jump off of the bridge without their elytras at the end
I feel like the only strategy you need for answering as many questions wrong as possible is to just say random words.  Or even just not-words.  Like "grimbus".  What the heck is a grimbus?
I really like the way you made the vault door!
I'm reminded of third life with those bridge deaths
Go on Mumbo!
That was actually very cinematic and heart felt haha. Good job Mumbo !
Mumbo have you thought about playing create mod with tango scar bdubds and zedaf?
1:20 they're called "bannasters"
if you let biden on hermitcraft, I'll never watch another episode.  the man is the biggest crook and pervert.
"Who's going to be the next person invited to Hermitcraft?" "UHHHH-UHHHHH-UHHHHH-PRESIDENT BIDEN!!!"
They're actually called hanging Deadman
I was grinning ear to ear through this entire episode. It's so great to see you back on the server, and especially to see you happy to be back. Much as I've missed the content, the wait has been worth it. Great work and excited to see the future!
Now that I've shown it to near 2m of you  As of being up for 4hr it's at 8m likes alone
This was such a lovely episode welcome back mumbo and I personally love the warped wiggles on the base!
I c I klik
Lets Get 2k (Thousand) Likes On This Comment
Can't wait for president Biden to be joining ❤️
10:33 Look At The Levels!!  The Number Is 69 HEHHE
4:24 Now someone needs to deepfake Joe Biden into HermitCraft XD
69 levels?
Grian and Mumbo reuniting just remind we of a just wholesome family reunion  Funny, Wholesome, and a bit awkward 💙
I just realized that Sahara from s6 of hermitcraft was a play on Amazon 🤦‍♂️
Doesn't Grian still owe Mumbo 5 diamond blocks for the second failed vault break in, or did I just miss that?
LETSSS GOOO
Biden has played BrndersMC  can't wait to see biden in Hermitcraft 🔥🔥🔥
Kind Friend Greeting (Grian) 8:11
Couldn't you just put furnaces under the stairs to keep the slime black from moving them? Save yourself some redstone?
i think the plants coming out of your base makes it look a bit more ominous when its dark out. maybe not so much during the day though.
The twirly things are great! (warped vines)
With Mumbo’s return he has not vowed allegiance to king Ren. He has barricaded his vault with traps to survive the invasion of Ren’s subjects. In an attempt to stop the economic king from causing too much damage.(event idea)
I like the twirly things. It may hide your vault, and we all know that the best vaults are actually the ones that can’t be found. Yeah I’d recon yours is nearly invisible!
PERFECTION. And dang the tears that started with Grian's Welcome Back. Hearing the Sheer Joy in his speech. ♡ Glad you are back. Time to crack on. 😁
can't wait for the mumbo and biden crossover
10:31 69 LEVELS
That Finale gave me the chills <3
There is a little bit of perfection that Mumbo is at level 69 when he ran towards Grian on the Bridge lmfaooooo
The level😂 is 69
What a wholesome and funny episode, almost moved to tears with the cinematic scene!
HE SAID HOPEFULLY YOU MISSED ME!!!!! brb GONNA CRY MY EYES OUT!!!!
i love the twirly things growing out of the base!  they make it look even cooler !!
the honey lagged into your inventory  hu weird
Such a cute way to end an episode lol 😂
Those are ballasts
You made my Girlfriend cry with your cinematic reunion shot
It's all I could have wished for
Scar with his boots Mumbo with his carrot  And Grian, eyeing Scars cookie Perfect
Mumbo!!!!!! Vídeo ideia: Use chatgpt for redstone contraptions ideas?
That ending got me cackling! Just how the video ends right on, "I'm a bit of a troll". 😂🧌
*people dying*  This is the magic behind the scenes -Alec Baldwin
LVL 69 lets GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"its how much i missed you" "you put your head on a spike"
Twirly things are great!
This episode is just so wholesone, now waiting for Iskall
Watching Hermitcraft while I'm supposed to be sleeping is a dangerous game. I never know when I might burst out laughing.
instead of a button for the entrance maybe use the skulk sensors you have already to trigger it
Mambo singers'that's what it's called
Mumbo, you should join in on Beef’s TCG game, especially considering that your rare card is one of the strongest cards in the game.
Petition for mumbo to release the first take of the cinematic ending where scar dies.
This just goes to show that slow-mo makes everything look better
I think the warp vines around the outside are a nice accent, and really bring life to the base.
I will expect the sleepy joe in the next season of hermetcraft xD
The boys are back in town! Whooooo1
That cinematic shot <3
Yayyy the Grumbo bromance reunion that we were all waiting for!!!! XD
please keep the green vine thingies
10 months of season 9 *mumbo about to make his first working door
100k+ watchers if you stream TCG with etho
Ok, I think I'm going to call my office my "Redstone testing world".
Mumbo and his smooth stone slabs are back!
The Sid thing are called a gap because no thing is there
omg this episode is so cute-- both reunion scenes have my heart melting 😭🥺❤
Watching Mumbo not mend his shovel with all of those levels was killing me.
Hey love that door
Can't wait for Joe Biden to join Hermit Craft!
love seeing you back, Mumbo :)
how to win xiumas game who are you: potato whats your favourite colour: the colour of a potato whose the next to join hc: the intentor of potatoes. etc. etc.
Their legs never touched the ground in the ending yet they were jumping... did anybody notice that? I mean except when they were standing. How is that possible?!
"I did miss you" *zooms in on Grian's crotch* 10:04  Is there something you need to tell us mumbo
"The Screeching Crevice"    How did you know my wife's pet name?
I like the vines
The sides of stairs are called stringers. Then balusters or spindles between that and a hand rail.
No sound ☹️.
287,076th view Also those end things are called salron's
10:30 noice
Please make more cinematic shots!
Moved to tears.
Weirdly sweet. Just as you all intended and wanted, I'm sure. Happy for you all.
PRESIDENT BIDEN 💀
Yo fr that backflip was insane
“Im like a little troll”-Mumbo 2023
Fun fact: you can stop the vines growth using shears
The most wholesome video ending ever!
President Biden enters the chat. :P
Really like the Redstone design section, makes your hermit craft videos feel more like your other videos
The ending scene is just...      *_PERFECTION_*
mumbo spending the rest of the video with 69 exp after grian....
Can't wait to see Joe Biden's debut on the Hermitcraft server
10:09
so no one will talk about 10:24 where his exp stop in the best number possible
It's not hermitcraft without u mumbo
PRESIDENT BIDEN NEXT MEMBER YEAAAAAAAA
um actually i think you'll find they are called ballistas
Mumbo used the move “Borrow” it was super effective
Finally
I can't wait for President Biden to become a Hermit.
10:22 69 levels
i can only imagine the trouble of keeping grian from finding a way to hop on while he was away just because he saw mumbo on
You know that a reunion is wholesome when nobody is talking about the fact that President Biden is going to be the next hermitcraft member lmao
Honestly, love that Mumbo is incorporating his love for cinema into his hermitcraft videos.
could we justappreciate the EXP bar at 17:09
10:20 Nice
We're back on track, ladies gents and everything in between.  The timestream has been united
Do you think Grian missed you, Mumbo?
Those things at the sides of staircases are called grind rails. They’re there for skateboarding and parkour.
mumbo. PLEASE do more cinematography stuff!! we all love hearing you talk about things you love! even if we don't fully understand them!! do what makes YOU happy, and we'll enjoy it!
PLEASE! Fuse your love for film with MInecraft! I can tell making that scene made you so genuinely happy! Glad to see you back Mumbo. :D
Great episode Mumbo!
greate base open,ing
No, because, SAME MUMBO. WE ALL WANTED THE SAME RUNNING TOWARDS EACH OTHER SCENE. AAAAAAAAAAA
Heh grian got mumbo to 69 lvls
Everything about this video is so satisfying and scratches an itch in my brain; pretty greenery inside a dark vault, the redstone launching door, and of course, Mumbo, Scar, and Grian. WE MISSED U GUYS SOO MUCH OEMEKKEKDMFMF
Bumbos lvls after his talk with Grian...................Nice !
I understand how you can like the tendrils growing up from the base but personally I like to see the dark moat thing as another challenge to ware of people trying to break into the intimidating vault. So having them shorter more represent strange tendril tentacles emerging from the darkness ready to pull an intruders leg. However I totally get where ur coming from and looks cool either way.
Wrong answers only? okay Theyre called girders
10:20 yeeeees he got 69!
the guardrails on the sides of staircases are called goobles coined by Charles Gooble in 1934 after his brother Mark Gooble fell to his death by trying to ride the, at the time nonexistent, goobles down the stairs to show off at a party.
That was amazing 😍🤩, keep doing this shots guy's
the title scared me
The trio has been reunited at last!
Mumbo Iskall thinks you're mad at him. He said so on his stream.
Season plan idea (which probably would've been more adapted for docm77) : build 3x3 chunk farms linked to a storage system with rails or flying machines. Under the storage, make a shop so hermits can buy things in your storage. Every time the stock of a ressource isn't full, automatically activate a chunk loader farming that resource. Maybe also make it so it can automatically move you to mob farms while you AFK. But you might not have time for that idea in this season and Impulse made iBuy, a big shop that already should sell many things.
I feel like pulling back all three stairs, and possibly then pulling the middle one down when the slime block gets pushed up and vice versa, might be easier then pushing them back up once the slime block pulls them down. Also a mechanism to pull the stairs away to open up a secondary door might be convenient.  Edit: the timing on the Redstone signals could also be tuned in a bit so that the door is open while you're bouncing up to it and you spend a bit less time with your face pressed up against a wall or at least put a bit of glass looking in on something under the stairs there. That and the button could stand to be moved to one of the pebbles on the bridge or something just for aesthetics.
THE CINEMATIC SCENE MADE ME SO HAPPY 😭
There's only one way to celebrate this momentus moment: Start a war.
I like the twirlery things
Joe Biden confirmed for season 10
I get so excited when I see that mumbo has posted a new video. Watching his videos always makes my day. Keep going mumbo, we all love you! ❤ Most importantly, WELCOME BACK!!!
Mumbo the lil troll
Can we just appreciate the fact that the experience finished at 69 level...
Grian's loud primal scream of "YOU'RE BACK" easily tops the episode lmao
no the light grey doesnt fit in jumbomumbo
I was thinking the 3 by 3 vault door but scaled up with slime/honey rows. Like 9 sliding doors in one
Idk if he has mending on his shovel, but it really annoyed me that he didn't hold it for the XP, and I was yelling “3! HOLD 3!” Lmao
10:22 NICE
Absolutely loved it, the redstone door is incredibly cool and the cinematic reunion had me grinning so much XD.
Answer to the questions.  Purple  purple   purple   purple
Grians excited scream when he saw you gave me so much serotonin
Ok but now we gotta get President Biden on Hermitcraft We just have to
I spent 20 minutes giggling like a twitterpated fool, thank you Mumbo!
they are house arrest barriers
That was the most beautiful reuinon ever
Grian set up a little date for them for when Mumbo got back 🥺🥺
Can't wait to see President Biden's interactions with all the other hermits on the server!
Seeing Grian back again was eggcellent
It was touching and cringe at the same time, I love it. 🤣
it hasnt started unless scar dies
😮😮😮😮😮😮😊
Welcome back! <3
I miss when Iskall would be on and hangout with the boys Grian and Mumbo. Either way, great to see Grian and Mumbo hanging out again!!
This is why I sub to Scar, grian and Mumbo. The silly people.
i lgit thot and now we kill scar right as G punished him
Mumbo, your base is quite chubblesome!
yaaay!
Definitely not a reunion of you three without immanent death 🤣
1:15 Bridge + edge = Bredge
The way he ended on level 69 with grian 😂
Yay your back... and just in time for season ten!
Grian gave enough XP to Mumbo to get him to level 69. If that isn't a great welcome back present I don't know what is.
Nice to see we're getting back to peak Grian and Mumbo shenanigans right off the bat 😊
Wouldn’t be a reunion between these three without at least a couple people falling to their deaths or into the void
Oh my god can’t believe Sleepy Joe is coming to hermit craft. I wonder if we get the other presidential boys
The daft squad back together. The server has no chance of survival.
I feel the need to point out that the xp level ended on level 69
loved the ending, really happy to see scar doing better,  but most important thing for him to know is his health comes first before making videos and same for you mumbo, Hope your break helped you also.
Movie magic indeed :)
I am genuinely happy-crying I missed these three absolute idiots so much
i love how his exp bar stopped at 69
1:17 I think they’re called toaster
In the lore Mumbo could’ve been frozen in a time capsule, or something, and that’s why he’s been gone so long 😂
Welcome home, Mumbo. 😊
BidenPlays minecraft video confirmed?
President Biden is joining Minecraft!
Me answering Xisuma's questions: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1... got em all wrong
im glad you didnt make it too bittersweet as an ending by including the screaming after, I was gunna cry and i've done enough of that, really
im sure it's a coincidence that the actual door to your base is blocked from grian's view
The EXP stopped with Mumbo at 69 levels  nice
Best Minecraft YouTuber ever! Not the best redstoner. Not the best builder. No good at PvP. And not much better at parkour. But definitely, without doubt, the most enjoyable to watch.
I like how the xp stopped at lvl 69... nice
10:10 nice
10:25 nice
2:20 Who else thought he was going to say something else?
"oh there he is, YOU'RE BACK *YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA👹* " -G
Excited to see Biden on the server
for the getting stuff wrong quiz, couldn't you just say cheese a bunch?
Love the screeching crevis but it might need a new name, kinda sounds like the punchline to ripping one if you know what I mean 🤔
This video made me smile so much I love your guys’ friendship ❤
I love the cinematik shot
name a better trio i'll wait
i cant wait to see president biden join hermitcraft next season!
WHAT?! Go to 1:05 and look at his inventory (specifically his sword)!!!
hermit craft is probably a better place for biden than the oval office tbh.  PS good to see the boys back together again.
Biden is a hermit confirmed
i will forever call those stairs squished Squidward
Not bannisters. Scar proof bridge seatbelts
The XP stopped perfectly at 69, is Grian getting suggestive? :D
1. reading the title… I guess the ritual worked 2. 2:54 is funny how Minecraft have existed and moded for so much years that now every server can put addons without it being an explicit mod server 3. 7:53 top 10 most expected moments from anime 4. 9:07 the artist gets into the engineer room to re-decorate everything… in-character)?
What fun! I found it hilarious that you commented on all the ongoing XP bubbles, while having a shovel on your hot bar in dire need of repair, and not switching to it so it could mend. And yes, that ending scene, tho.
69 levels, nice
8:01 that YEAAAUHH was great 😂
GRIAN AND MAMBO ARE BAAAAAACK 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
69 levels lmao
And they lived happily ever after.  Scar died quite often, but he always respawned and found his stuff with a smile on his face.
YOU HEARD I HERE JOE BIDEN WILL JOIN HERMITCRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice
10:30 ahhh yea 69 levels
4:25 We all know where that came from lol  good job dude
I’ve been waiting a year for this. ❤❤❤
Now I’m wondering who will join Hermitcraft next?!?
That was beautiful.
Mumbo’s XP after his welcome back ceremony was truly nice
Welcome back, Mumbo.
Nice 10:26
the boys are back in town!!!
10:21 the EXP stopped at level 69 xDDDDD
Someone better edit the ending with the song 🎵 tonight the music seems so loud 🎵
I love that when Codina asked mumbo to name a super power he *didnt* have he was struggling to name one
Just by the title I can tell that this video is gonna be extremely entertaining
HIS XP AT 10:29j
Love the exp level their Mumbo 11:30
Biden would forget the server password, so he'd never actually play lol
I cried at the end
Wish Mumby was in the new Life series 😭
Love the door! And what a welcome back party!
nice xp level
So Wholesome :)
10:00 mumbo laughing as he says “i did miss you as well” and zooming into grian’s crotch is uhhhh… kinda sus.  also, nice exp
Reunited and it feels so good
Swear
That ending was so perfect i'm crying
that ending slo-mo was both the funniest thing I've ever seen but also the most wholesome
Love ya vids I'm so pumped
I have a suggestion: Replace the sculk with catalyst, they give off a very faint source of light and create a sort of deep water effect.
Make red stone chess in Minecraft where you can control it like from Harry Potter
Mumbo predicted the “presidents play minecraft” trend on tiktok
Welcome back.
Unironically nostalgic during that ending scene lol
you can manage the warped vines with sheers now if you want to but i think whatever you like the most is what is right
69 levels gone in an instant
Soo... How did Mumbo ever get out from under the bridge?
Beautiful.
also. Eggs
The trio is BACK and I’m SUPER HYPED
You can use the skull sensor for detect an especific action for enter the vault.
my heart
69 levels.... nice 😐
I cant believe mumbo leaked that president biden is going to be joining hermitcraft
BrunoDanUy should be the next youtuber to join Hermitcraft, he's the best
PRESIDENT BIDEN ON HERMICRAFT AI PREDICTED IT(?
-6:29-- did mumbo just forget non-pushable- -blocks exist?-
Can we have the first cinematic that Scar miss the bridge and dies please
I want someone to love me like mumbo and grain love each other. So wholesome 😂
I’m so excited for next season of hermitcraft when president Biden joins
So excited to see president Biden join next season of hermitcraft. I wonder if there are plans to get any more world leaders on the server?
im pretty sure that would be called a bridgemabob. I'm a bridge scientist so i know
I was half expecting in the cinematic shot for Grian and Mumbo to run towards each other in slow mo, and then Scar Hotguys both of them off of the bridge.
NOT MUMBO TALKING ABOUT THE MINECRAFT LEGS MOTION IM DYING I CANT BELIEVE IT LMAO
Why did ‘It’s been a long day’ by Wiz Khalifa start playing immediately in my head during Mumbo Grian’s and Scar’s reunion??? 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
EXP stopped PERFECTLY on 69
i love the happy grian noises
mumbo, i have an idea to elevate your entrance, add some chains going from the top corners of your cube to the door, made out of copper
Mumbo Wow-  I wasn't expecting that really profound and really cinematic and really wholesome moment from you at the end. You're a deeply gorgeous, creative, gentle, mature and profound human Mumbo and you brought tears and a smile to my face today.  I was introduced to minecraft youtube content with one of BdoubleO's first ever collabs on youtube with himself and  "GuudeBoulderfist" playing the Vechs super hostile map series and from there followed their channels, then Beef's, Doc, GenerikB, Etho and the B-team.  I learned from Generik and  Bdubs about  Hermit craft in the early days and first learned how to do redstone from Generik and then you-  so between GenericB and yourself formed the foundation of all the redstone I've ever done.  Today-  I've felt like sharing with anyone who reads this and yourself the  nostalgic and inspiring for the love, comradery,  beauty and  gratitude we've all shared and pulse of "many" and "more" and "together" and "new goldens" for the future.  Thank you earth internet communities, I love you. -Pyra of the Empress Variety
That ending scene was everything and the bit after was just perfect 😂
Not a banister it's called a lemon.
69 levels NICE
Yaaaaaaay
Troll Toll Booth!!!!!
...and just like that, all is right with the world again.
Poor iskall85
WOOOO REUNION!!!
Big old man hand hold wall handles of power
Glad you are back.
I know Mumbo has been watching the 3 presidents playing minecraft videos. He wants sleepy Joe to join.
Mumbo, Grian and Scar were the first Hermits I watched episodes of. So glad to see them back together. Can’t wait to see the mischief :D
what about iskall though?
Next time, on hermitcraft. Grian decides to ruin Mumbo's score by recruiting Biden to hermitcraft! Stay tuned
1:16 i think it might be called stairUserProtecter
You should make a Minecraft Movie
just answer each question with "four" youll be able to get the record then
1:16  its called stair borders
if you just say "ah" for every question, then you technically got every question wrong since "ah" isnt the right answer
The exp stopping at 69 was perfect
Mumbo, I think the vines look great when they are high, but I suppose maybe not TOO high, like 20 blocks above the base high, love Ur vids btw.
no one is talking about the *noice amount of levels he had 🤣🤣
Nice.
The reuniting was so wholesome
Bro you could have just used glass blocks to hold the side stairs up on the slime launcher
Stair-arms!
Lvl 69, nice
The Vinie blue stuff is cool imo
President Biden on Hermitcraft?!
hi
I want that Cinematic Reunion as a short so I can watch just that part again and again and again and...
This made me feel real happiness
His lvl ended on 69 after the xp bottles😳
This is a neurotic complaint, but the interior staircase of the vault has no blocks under it, and it looks a little floaty/unsturdy/should blend more into the shape of the room imo
That end scene was perfect
Absolutely hilarious.
the stair things are called barrystars
that little arrival party Grian set up was too sweet, and that ending just sealed the deal. Nearly shed tears
I'm looking forward to President Sleepy Joe Biden competing with Bdubs to see who sleeps first.
Grain was so happy! That’s how you know you have a great bff! XD
I love these three so much.
you guys are fucking nerds... and im totally here for it. cheers.
HOLY SHIT MUMBO JUMBO CONFIRMED IT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS COMING TO HERMITCRAFT
lvl 69 lol
Me: eh I think I'll be normal about mumbo and grian both being back  Mumbo: no???? You won't????????
12:35-12:42, I just replayed that little part for about 10 minutes on repeat because it was so funny and so relatable
i love the swirly bits and bobs
Those things on the side of staircases are called Lannisters, your welcom
It’s enough to make a grown man cry
Yay!! Seeing my kids excitement when they realized you were truly back was amazing. They were dancing and partying with you and Grian there at the end. Welcome back, Mumbo!
“bannisters? ¿.? Wrong answers only” *those are trail liners*
(Groan’s head on a pike) Grian: “It’s cute!”
bumbo
The sheer giddiness I felt seeing grian catching up with mumbo, it’s amazing :D
the xp bottles hitting lvl 69 lol
if i dont see any edits of that cinematic piece at the end i will RIOT
Seeing you three all happy together feels so wholesome <3
10:24 perfectly nice
Of course it stops at level 69...
That ending is actually making me tear up...
That bit with Grian inside the vault is the reason why Mumbo is the richest person in HermitCraft. Edit: And, of course, the ending.
Cannot wait for President Biden's entrance onto the hermitcraft server
This is so wholesome 🥰🥰
bro had the manual labor door
One week later, Hermitcraft was forced to close due to a rampant trio of hermits. It's great to them together again.
“President Biden” is joining hermit craft
I love how happy grian is that mumbo is back
Grian will definitely push the button
Grian throwing an xp party for Mumbo is the greatest thing ever
Perfect timing 3:14
15:00 All you need now for the door is for when you push the door, button to leave. Where you would normally Land outside has a cushion that appears for a couple of seconds free to Land on so you don't take damage and then it disappears again
I tear came out of my eye, incredible
Poultry man?
Gosh im glad mumbos back on hermicrayf.  I missd dis man, such a relatable approach to minecraft, but such advancedness
Grain hasn’t released his video. SPOILERS!
When the do ended at 69 levels
Now we need him back in limited life
It’s a work of art
How many likes for the replay footage of the first attempt??
just constructive feedback, please remove the faint background music in your videos🙏 love ya jumbo
gard rails
That cinematic scene was top notch
3:06 how did mumbo get that achievement there? That's breaking a diamond hoe...or is it netherite now? Either way what?
The reunion was so adorable, these two best friends haven't seen each other in months, and then are finally reunited. I love you guys
If you noticed mumbo had 69 levels   👇
10:00 Grian: "did you miss me?" Mumbo: *stares directly at grians crotch*
69 levels...nice
Vault hunters lore
your gonna have to put some string ontop of those twisted vines before a plane runs into them lol
the positive energy those 3 create is what i missed the most
This made me so happy! The reunion! Finally 🤣
That was everything I could have ever wanted, plus a bag of chips. It's so good to see you guys back together!!! 💙
Also Mumbo could of mended all his items and not just his pickaxe with the XP.
Is it too late to throw Mumbo into the Limited Life plane before it leaves the runway?
So what happens if Mumbo quit HermitCraft altogether? Would Grian lose his mind by building Mumbo faces everywhere?
FINALLY! I cant wait to see what grumbot prime does once you actually talk to him.
We need the first attempt of the ending made into a cinematic, it would be cool
Always the highlight of the day when mumbo uploads.
Grians happy scream was so happy!
I have the widest grin on my face after watching that ending scene
So much xp and that shovel didnt get repaired
Can’t wait for the special appearance of Sleepy Joe!
The post credit scene of this cinematic masterpiece is astounding!
😊😊😊👩‍👦‍👦
Proof that Grian and Mumbo are best friends ever
Will you be joining Grian's Limited Life series?
eggs.... ex... ex-ter-min-ate...? exterminate! (/ref) also, you've got 8 mil subs, not 2 mil, so you've shown the base to 8 mil people on the internet lol
Mumbo, I suggest you place a string above the vines, that would prevent it from growing too high.  Like if you agree 👍
Grian and mumbo run towards each other and scar shoots them both
The three brain cells are reunited at last 🎉🎉
OMG I MISS MUMBO AND GRIAN and also grian getting eggs? poultry man??
Such a good cinematic shot
nobody talked about how many lvls mumbo have after the ball pit party ?
That end was so perfect 🥹 I’m so glad all three of the boys are home together at last 💜💖
you only needed 4 honey blocks
I love how Grian was missing Mumbo Jumbo so much and how he was beaming when mumbo came back. Welcome back Mumbo!
Perfectly on 69 levels. Great job Grian
the edges of bridges are bridge edges
Im predicting he will have rigged the entrance button into a trapdoor for grian to fall for between episodes.
I’m not crying!  You’re crying!
19:25 where is iskall?
Just awnser cheeseburgers to awnser the questions wrong
ah yes, grian leveling mumbo to level 69
What about iskall?
4:27 why did i think the same thing
So I thought cjya shouted loud, welp Grian, you topped that.
the xp stopped at level 69
Clicked faster then you can say “vault”
this was my childhood
18:48 is the must beutiful moment  :)))))))))))
Anyone else mad that he didn’t use the XP to make all his tools max durability
Keep the spindly things, they look great!
The XP level matching bdubs right after his dragon fight an hour ago 🤨
4:28 why just why! 😂😂😂
I don't think that I'm alone when I say that I completely support President Biden joining Hermitcraft 😎
could you add the noChatReports mod to get rid of the little red mark next to messages and the warning pop up please
so when would you say President Biden is joining hermitcraft?
Anybody else just really miss the barge and everything else about season seven?
Only person missing is Iskall
We need the scene to be animated. Map makers get on it
now why did that cinematic make me want to cry a bit
Each time Grian tries to break in, change the location of the button to trick him
This Episode made me SO HAPPY! I haven't laughed this loud in a WHILE! Finally you guys are reunited! This is just Great! Thank you guys for being back!!!
Estos videos me dan años de vida, sobre todo el final  :)
A cinematic masterpiece🥲
Grian needs eggs 🥚 PM
I've watched 0:58 and instantly remember grian saying "It feels like mumbo's base may be getting a little too close to mine."
Mumbo I think the honey was a result of lag
wrong answers only you say...   its a snake
Grian's reaction to Mumbo's return reminded me of a certain streamer's reaction.
I cannot explain how hard I have tried to create a half-decent block pallet :/  You would think I was colourblind.  Imma just steal Mumbo's block pallets in the future...
It would’ve been so funny if Grian had killed you as as the XP had stopped!
Remember mumbo summoned him
Ok I will fully admit the shedding a happy tear at the reunion cut scene!!!! You and all the hermits bring such joy, fun and kindness into this world! 🥰🥰 wicked vault entrance !!!!
What was that glitched frame at 16:04? I can’t get it or pause at the right time?
The bit at the edge of the stair is the “stringer”.
Me just saying awnser duck to all of them
Grian's XP bottle confetti party was the most adorable thing I've seen all week
I've really missed the chaotic energy that is Mumbo, Grian and Scar. Let the chaos begin!
President biden? Hermitcraft? Presidents play on the hermitcraft server (ai voice meme) needs to be made!?
It’s called an itsy bitsy tiny blue banisterinys
That XP Though... Nice! (10:30)
The stairs handles are called a bascotti, and they are great with tea or hot cocoa
mumby gumby
Now we need to get Biden to join Hermitcraft.
The fact his lvl stopped at 69 makes it even better LMAO
The replay shot at the end was perfect, you should do more of those
That end scene was perfection
Love you guys!
lisp?
Boop
If Biden isn't on season 10 I swear I'm never watching another mumbo video again!!!   Okay I lied i will still watch every video he posts like I have since the begining..
more cinematic minecraft please
The last bit had me choking up 🥹 And just when i was about to cry Scar fell ….perfect timing…..and then Mumbo 😂 I can’t believe how happy that made me 💖 so so good. Welcome back Mumbo 🎉
I'm sorry but now we need president biden as a guest on the server
Y’all are so goddamn wholesome on HermitCraft it melts my heart
This brought tears to me eyes
Let the twirly things unapologetically reach build height.
Biden next hermit confirmed?
When I saw the title I thought it was about the agreement that Grian would try to break into his vault and Mumbo would make traps to earn diamonds from Grian’s failed attempts, I hope they still remember this and it continues later on
I think Iskall would be happy for a reunion too 🥺
The pure joy in Grian's voice at seeing you gave me so much serotonin that my crops were watered, my skin was cleared, and my depression was alleviated. I love how wholesome you two are!!
Ngl i was half expecting for Mumbo and Grian to dramatically meet at the bridge and Scar just flies in an knocks Grian off
Beautiful beautiful bravo bravo
10:10 nice
Ummm has anyone noticed the amount of ep mobmbo has?…..
mumbo, they're called petri dishes
I freaking Called it, that scar would end up dying in the cinematic shot!
Always a treat to have a video Mr. Mumbo
1:16 - I'm pretty sure they're called ornate Greek caryatids...
Can you teach me redstone
arrrgggggg been so long since mumbo was on hermitcrafttttt now the fun can continueeee!!
Those things by the staircase is called a bidet (Mumbo did say wrong answers only)
The Sculk Shrieker's are getting kinda annoying, you should change the in-game to a sound of grian
Answer is ball
So, Treeman is Mumbo favorite nickname right ?
1:13 I think they’re called barrels
This has made me so happy.  Thanks guys!  <3
I have a suggestion, have another little hanging brige inside and lava on the floor or maybe falling from the ceiling then the next wall straight ahead is door to the main area
1:16 old people safety borders
The ending scene is majestic
The end was basically “Avengers Assemble”
I WAS CHEERING FOR THE XP TO STOP AT 69 AND IT DID LETS GOO ‼️
Mumbo at 3:30 or something, Its called ballistic munitions armament
I almost cried when they ran at each other missed ya mumbo 😊
5:23 this is the feeling I get when trying to talk in a group. As soon as I say something, someone else has to talk/scream/shout over it :P :D  10:29 The XP stopping at 69 ... Noice!
I'm incredibly excited for President Biden is joining Hermitcraft!!!!!!!
I actually almost started to cry omg the trio is back!
THAT ENDING SCENE MADE ME CRY
They're called Bulks, Bruce Bannister's alter ego.
SMILING SO BIG AT THE END OF THE VIDEO 😭
that ending had me grinning from start to finish. its good to have you back mumbo :D
the sound of Mumbo and Grian laughing at the same time makes me laugh too 😆
lul
Can't wait for the deep fake TikToks with Biden and Mumbo on the Hermitcraft severer lol
Grian and Mumbo interacting gives me life it’s always more fun.
Mumbo deserves an Oscar or a BAFTA for that cinematic masterpiece.
Bro who is joking hermit craft next tho????
10:09 Nice.
Sheeshhh the cenimatic shot bro
This is one of the best videos I have seen in a while and definitly one of the top videos from Mumbo ever. Just so happy to see him with Grian and Scar again!
little troll
hearing mumbo and grians voices together is somewhat serene
Now THAT is a proper Hermitcraft greeting, it just isn’t Hermitcraft if Scar hasn’t direct-impacted something at Mach 7. 🤣
I am awaiting the animatic of that scene at the end
We are ALL tht happy you are back!
Grian played what I think of as "Soup Group song"
It ended at level 69 😶
I can't help but to notice the number of levels Mumbo was on after he was done leveling 🏃‍♀
the dynamic duo are back together again finally. it's nice seeing minecraft's favorite bromance reunited
10:10 - 17:38 Nice
Eggs?
That one stray exp orb at 11:10 🤣
I kinda think the squiggles distract from the base a little bit. Try placing string at a height you like so they stay there and don't get to big.
His levels stopped at 69
Mumbo's vault now contains the most priceless thing of all - friendship.
If you answer an answer incorrectly but you were told to answer it incorrectly does that mean you were actually correct
I just wanna say that I am so glad you took the time you needed to find that spark for creating Minecraft content again, and I'm even more glad that you're back at it giving us absolute GEMS of content like this! What a wholesome episode, a joy to watch from start to finish!
I can’t wait to see President Biden join the server 🦅🇺🇸 Mumbo is so patriotic
Although the cinematic ending was beautiful, I love all the character in the previous attempt.
xisuma's skull staff thingy looks like it would be called 'the punisher'
10:22 hehe
Was it just me who noticed grian gave mumbo a "69" exp with is making it rain?
Pretty sure those are Bandandisters
Green bits be too long, i'd let them grow to about half that of a max height (not all of them) and then add string to keep them there
I'm a simple man; I see a new mumbo upload, squeel in excitement, and watch with glee
The amount of happiness I got from seeing you three all together again it's immeasurable :)))))
So Mumbo's least favorite nickname isn't Tree Man. Noted
I think you need some deepslate in the staircase so its not so light and dreamy compared to your dark and solitary base. But I’m really loving your base so far
The bridge scene was epic!
How kindhearted of you all to invite Sleepy Joe to play Hermitcraft in season 10. I
The boarder or banister would best be called guard rails.... technically not ADA or building code [4' high] doubt hermitcraft has such restricting rules on creativity
They are called chafens it’s root chaf comes from the original Italian. The ending ens comes from the Latin word, bananas.
Spoliers for To Your Eternity     Mumbo comimg back but not getting to see Grian for a couple of episodes feels like March coming back and not getting to see Fushi for a couple of episodes. Except, fortunately, nether of them died at any point.
18:45 for the ending scene
Grian got you to level 69, xD
Reuniting with scar dying is probably the most accurate version of this.
Is just me or does Mumbo's vault door look like a guardian?
President Biden on HermitCraft: "Come on man, Corn Pop is on his way and I need to get kitted out with some netherra.. nethe.. northerite.. ya know the thing"
The ahot would have been better if they were just walking normally
Ngl, the way this would go with my friends. Me and my friend would run towards each other just for my third friend to dive down and blow up everyone with an end crystal.
I doubt any of us need to say anything grian was probably spying XD
The side rails of the stairs are called old-people-fail-safe-stair-mechanism i think
Biden is gonna play Hermitcraft? Cool!
I couldn't stop smiling for 20 minutes. This episode made me so happy. My face hurts because my grin is so big!
The ending truly made me cry of happiness, I've missed this trio so much and they are finally together again :')
The things on the side of the stairs are called railings. I'm honestly disappointed in you to an extent. 1:25
The things on the edge of a staircase is called a borister.
Now we need to get Biden on the hermitcraft server
Mumbo grian loves to press butttons, you need to change that 😂
I have this recurring dream where I have been invited to join hermitcraft and I'm in the discord and everything but it takes me months to get the courage to actually login and play. Then when I actually play everyone on the server is SO nice, and I'm sure it would be like that, this place is just so wholesome.
theyre walking up hill sides
The whole interaction reminds me of Dr. Ivo Robotnik after having left the mushroom planet and reuniting with his assistant. Though I suppose in this case, the feelings were mutual.
I hunk Grian saying “eggs” might be him saying he will fill your base with chickens…
Because I am a child, 10:10 is when he reaches 69 Xp
19:06 You should’ve asked Scar to shoot one of you with his bow
Aaaaah I'm so happy you're back and together with Grian and Scar
It's all coming together so nicely
They are the bridge’s Ear lobes
The twirly things growing high are great.  If you like them, keep them.  I would.  Good to see you having fun!
Now I want to see a presidential deepfake of Biden joining Hermitcraft
Stairsideways
14:54 how the hell did you connect the Redstone to the button 😳😳
amogusn't
man i cant wait for president biden to join hermitcraft
The ending scene made me so unnecessarily emotional 🥲
The video we all needed ❤
what cursor do u use mumbo
I think mumbo just created a political war between his viewers
um...someone must be cutting onions cuz uh my eyes are just flowing right now
I’m so happy to see you all back together, you have no clue how much it really warms my heart. I’m so happy that you’ve gotten the break you deserve and I am excited and awaiting the silliness to come!!!
WOOO the squad reunited! Time for sacrifice to gravity!! 😂
Just need Iskall now
I personall y like the twirling vines really tall.
You could use the shrieker to activate your door
its not banisters, ist an escalator frozen in time.
Eirly to watch
worth it...also you're all completely barmy, and we're here for it!
I hear grumbot might be available if you need a plan..
If you use shears on the top of the plant it'll not get any taller
10: 21 Requisite "Nice."
I'm glad you got a mental health break, but I'm so happy you are back on the Hermitcraft server!
8:57  Grian is basically Mumbo’s Minecraft girlfriend. 😂
For anyone that needs it This is the moment mumbo and grian see each other for the first time in months 7:50
I hope mumbo makes a hermitcraft docuseries.
I love how mumbo’s levels stopped at 69 😂
The way this put a smile on my face and a tear in my eye... The gang is back together again! 🎉🤩
YEEEESSS POULTRY MAN STRIKES AGAIN
Mumbo: It's so simple, I don't know how anything can go wrong! Murphy: 😈
That was absolutely beautiful I’m so thrilled you guys are back on together
The boys are back The boys are back And they're lookin for trouble!
Just shed a tear
So we're allowed the president Biden ai on?
Thanks for the emotions mumbo. 🙌🏾
The reunion gave Lord of the Rings vibes when all the Hobbits meet each other again and then the rest of the Fellowship comes in behind the door to greet Frodo.
the bois are back, this is one of the best hermitcraft episodes I've ever seen
that was the most emotional moment in the history of film.
Try to build more organic
glad the 2 of you are back together in hermitcraft!
I can’t express the Happiness I feel when I see three together.
I’ve seriously missed the Grian Mumbo collabs
Just think back to the time before they made it that you pick up XP orbs at your feet. You would've had your face absolutely covered.
sus xp levels u ended off there mumbo
See, now that was an awesome episode. Some building, some interaction, some tears and smiles. I wish all Hermits discover that "bigger and better" in the just good entertainment is more important than bigger builds
Ending made me cry!! ❤
i am
With a Redstone door and Grian surprises. This episode feels like the true return of my favorite hermit.
Wrong answers only for the correct word for banisters? Stair safteys.
Stair rail btw
The only way the ending could have been done better, is if scar "experienced kinetic energy" right as they made it to one another.
Glad you are back because I had given up on hermitcraft all together
What about iskall :(?
Welcome BACK!!!
There potato wedges
If only iskall was part of this...Still love his new series though
Yay! Finally, you guys meet again! This makes me so happy, but also, does it bug anyone else that Scar had boots on and Mumbo had carrots in his hand? Idk it makes me annoyed lol. FRIENDS REUNITED!
18:52 this should be in a movie! Beautiful shot there!
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but was that the first time you've tested a redstone build and it worked first time?
"we are back" "reunited" "i missed you so much" "such a long time" This is literally your second hermit episode before the break and you met everybody in their videos before your first return video. Why all this now?
Timestamp for anyone looking for the grumbo reunion scene :)   7:50
We missed you, Treeman. 🌳
I quite like the twirls. They give good perspective and lines
Is it just me or does his vault look like something from hollow knight?
place water on the skulk sensors to make them quiet
The boys are back together again let’s go
8:57  Grian is Mumbo’s Minecraft girlfriend. 😂
Why does Grian bridge look like it has eyebrows or a upside down moustache at 18:50.
Of course the xp stops at 69
69
i really like the twirly swirly blue stuff, jumbo of the mumbo
1:14 I think they are called "edge bit thingos"
Omg I was just thinking it would be so cool to launch the player with a slime block but I didn't think that was what he was actually going to do!
YOU LOST SO MUCH LEVELS D:<
I've never seen anything as wholesome as this video in my life.
I said it on X's short, but I'll say it again ;  "Where is Grain?"  Well funny you should ask that, because he's right OVER HERE!
Mumbo and Grian Cinematically running up and meeting in the middle of the bridge, only for scar to come in, miss the bridge and die instantly is fitting as hell   *It's good to be back huh mumbo?*
1:15 Footrails
BIDEN CONFIRMED FOR HERMITCRAFT!!!!!!
10:00" yeah I did miss you"  * looks straight at grians crotch"
For some reason I imagined someone walking in on mumbo and seeing him getting overly excited about a door
you know that working bank you made? you being the richest might need some protection and you could get richer if you charge for using the bank.. you see where im going here?
153,000th OH YEAH IN YORE FACE! Lol
0:40 actually he broke in once more while you were away. So he technically owes you diamond blocks.
Mumbo's XP stops at 69 Me: Nice!
Glad to have you back, Mumbo :D I *highly* recommend checking out the TCG shop in the Shopping District. It's the Quartz one with the white glass full of vending machines with names hovering over them! Trust me, you'll be happy to see what it's for :)
finally grian breaking in is back
grian is going to find the button
This was pretty damn adorable
Okay, what about Iskall? :D
The ending scene is adorable!!!!! I can't believe it worked out!!  I hope Mumbo plays out a bit more of his cinematography tricks on normal episodes!! I feel like I'd add a lot of charm!!
Oh man that cinematic gave me chills, so so good!
Best episode ever <3
Wished that Mumbo was back to the life series and in season 4 (Limited Life), but I'm still happy he's back in Hermitcraft with Grian!
they tried to do something epic only to immediately have two of them die comedically.... the Three Dumbigos are back, baby!!
If at any point you want to halt the growth of the blue vine things, you should be able to place string at the top. I haven’t played for a while. Might not work.
Please make for cinematic shots because omg im in love
10:18 nice
Someone tell mumbo you can silence skulks
The diamonds in your chest were from your diamond tower
Confirmed President Biden is the next hermit 😂😂😂😂
The last few minutes of this made me so happy I got a bit emotional.  Thanks Mubmo <3
The end scene was everything!!!!!!
Hermitcraft season 10:  Mumbo: "alright, it looks like we have our starter base finished. But I need some advice on the block palette..."  A voice is heard from the distance: "Hello"  "Joe Biden! What are you doing here!?"  "I got hairy legs... tha- tha- that turn blonde in the sun. Mumbo, I think that an assortment of green will work. You ever want to go to the store, but Iraqis are eating ice cream? That's why we celebrate Hanukkah on the 4th of July. God bless our troops!"  **JebBush6969 joined the game**  "You didn't clap for me when you had the chance. Now you will pay for your insolence!"  **every block turns into ender dragons"
You should add a slime bock that pops out when you are leaving your vault
Eggs? Reeks of poultry man...
10:35 funny xp number
beautiful
I got chills from that ending literal chills 🥶
The end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I imagine Mumbo watching Top gun maverick and saying goodness gracious great balls of fire in a video and nailing the accent
Welcome back, Treeman.
Cant wait to see president biden run for president of hermitcraft!
:')
Jumbo: I've missed you *while zooming into grians crotch* lmao
I can't wait for President Joe Biden to join Hermitcraft!
Biden in hermitcraft
8:57  Grian is basically Mumbo’s girlfriend. 😂
10:22 lmao the level stopped right at a certain nice number
The ending MAKES this!
Am I the only one who expected grian to rub against mumbo and purr during their reunion?
15:04 YES! Why only ONE MORE time?! ;)
lets be honest.... that was very in character for Scarwhen he flew in to the bridge  XD
That cinematic shot was beautiful
That ending was beautiful
am i the only one noticing the xp shower didn't want to ruin the nice level of mumbo ?
Well scar dieing to Kinetic energy pretty normal on a daily basis
13:55 made me laugh so hard
Fully worth waiting for. Everything I could have ever wanted.
look at the levels mumbo has after the xp rain😂
Vsauce Mumbo isn't real, he  can't  hurt you. Vsauce Mumbo: 0:40
I love the grown vines! They match your base well!
is it just me or is the UI really big
It’s hereeeeeeeeee
Bidencraft
Hermitcraft was the friends we made along the way
With the door so much in your face when you land i feel like you need to bump up the FOV
my favorite trio all back together
I think the trick for Xisuma's question is just to find one answer that is wrong for every question, no matter what he says. Just say something like "12" no matter the question, then you don't have to think about it
10:09 Nice
My favorite trio is finally back together!
7:50  Oh. You’re home early.
Mumbo is so humble, the richest hermit, but still dresses like he's the poorest
You should get the minecraft crocs
Is it just me or does that bridge look like something out of harry potter between 2 wizards about to fight to the death.
They're called Barristers
Omg THANKYOU for the Best group huge of all time!!!!!!
The edges of a bridge? They called ridges. Where DID you think the name bridge came from?
It's called a car..
Mumbos chat font size is the same as my nan’s iphone
Ello
10:21 Noice
Imagine if THE Joe Biden joined season 10 and mumbo was right
They are so silly /aff
17:36 "I don't have an Elytra!" *Elytra falls out of corpse*
So nice that the XP form the bottles stopped at 69
Am I the only one hoping it would stop at 69 xp and got the exact wish 🤪👍
It has been too long since they have interacted
Grian is like a labrador retriever, you get back from vacation and THAT is when they start breaking things, because they are excited.
smiling so wide
You should make a mini-biome around your base because the dark colors look kinda out of place like how about a sculk biome but because sculk was made to live in the dark its contained in a glass dome of tinted glass.
Hi Mumbo! If you want to avoid triggering the shrieker while building under the base in the future, you can create a wall of wool.
I legit had a tear come to my eye at that cinematic shot. It feels like Endgame or something. I couldn’t be more excited to see what you guys get up to next
10:21 Nice level.
Now if that's not a mumbo jumbo vault I don't know what is to be honest
Now were all wondering what it would be like to have Biden on Hermitcraft lol
Why not water log the skulk sensors?
Just wanted to point out the fact that he stopped leveling up at 69 levels 👀
We have confirmed President Biden will be in the next Hermitcraft.
It’s so beautiful, I love it
I really want you see amazing things with the Create mod
I just know someone's gonna make an edit where Biden joins Hermitcraft, it's inevitable at this point.
I feel like there is an opportunity with those sponsors at the entry to trigger something every time you walk in. Like fireworks. Or the word boobies. Or something.
1:17 the stair crust
Grain was so happy! Made me smile! Good to have you officially back to the hermit craft life
I’m not crying. You’re crying. :’)
That ending was amazing. The slow version made me so happy and the normal version made me laugh when grian punched you off. Really shows the true relationship lol.  So glad to have you back mumbo!
I can't express how happy I am
5:47 sounds like a great place to me
Don't forget about your deal with Grian and him breaking into your volt and keeping all your riches
Grian: You missed me? Mumbo: *zooms in on gri-oin*
Yah those things on the sides of the stares are called slides that go weee!!!
Grian's voice when Mumbo came back was wholesome and heartwarming😌
That was a NICE amount of exp Grian surprised Mumbo with.
the fact that the xp thing stopped at 69 levels is just the icing on the cake
Mumbo and Grian is the best combo 🫠
17:00 it's the perfect trio, Grain is really good at Building, Mumbo is really good at Redstone, and Scar is really good at Dying
*sniff* It's beautiful
You should use skulk sensors to open the vault door (to exit)
Treeman is the worst nickname?
I never realized how much I missed that giggle until I heard it again. Also, i couldn't stop smiling seeing them together again :)
i love that the xp levels stopped at 69 lol
I think mumbo found all the president deep fakes playing minecraft on tiktok
The boys are back in town
For the quiz you should have just kept saying incorrectly
I just noticed that Mumbo still has his waffle from S8. I hope it's permanent
Of course you ended up with 69 levels.
Mumbo shall henceforth be known as Treeman.
if you place string on plants, like bamboo or sugarcane it stops them from growing taller
Mumbo you do realise that showing the secret button that people are going blab to grain
It's the 69 levels for me
Mumbo. You should create a server wide bank with atms and stuff
Cool
This puts a smile on my face
I’ve never been more happy to see a youtube video, this is my favourite video of all time
19:00 Perfect cinematic :D
It's confirmed! Biden in hermit craft
Call it a hunch, but I think they were all happy to be back on the server playing together.
69!
69 xp
17:00 that seane could not have been any more scar then that
I love watching Mumbo while editing
The Boys Are Back In Town, well on Hermitcraft. Are you ready? Get ready.
I'm glad mumbo and grian are back together but man the only thing missing is Iskall
this should of been called the garden of grian lol
Grian fans will love that the xp went to 69.
Everything about this episode is perfect
I can't wait for President Biden to join Hermitcraft
**exp finally stops** Nice. (His levels)
Lmao the XP ended at 69 in the Grain scene
Lolz
crying
WOOOOOOO
Oh for goodness' sake...  That was EVERYTHING I could have ever wanted in life. <3
IT’s HAPPENinG THEY’rE REUNITINg AT LoNG LAsT
Soooo.... Did Grian get everything in the vault
10:27 nice
The things on the sides of stairs are called spandrels.
Biden Gaming
NGL that ending scene brought tears to my eyes. So glad you three were re-united
If you run towards each other on the bridge you have to play chariots of fire in the background
that friends reuniting scene was amazing, i had a smile in my face the entire time :D
Plz add create mod
That reunion scene is the most beautiful thing I have seen in Minecraft :)
10:30 Nice
Mumbo Casually pausing and then ignoring the screecher every time is hilarious.
just been grinning for the whole 20 minutes :D
I love these hermitcraft content and really entartains me so, THANK YOU!!!!!
It bothers me that you didn't take the xp shower as a chance to repair your tools 🤣
Grian : What's going on nowadays? Mumbo : Oh you know just being rich.
Can we get a how to build with that door
President Biden. I would love to see a video of Biden playing Minecraft, trying to  navigate stairs.
All I could think at the title was "Yeah, DUH! That's his job!!! Not to mention you DID summon him last episode!"
Mumbo, i don‘t watch a lot of YouTube Videos, but of i wanna watch something, i always Check your channel! It‘s good to see you back on hermitcraft ❤
4:57  alright boys, you know what to do.
Here at "posted 4 mins ago"
Pretty sure they’re called fun stoppers
The ending of the episode made me so incredibly happy, especially after the first season of hearmitcraft I ever watched was season eight. And I just adored the entire boatem crew. I was sad when Scar was constantly at the hospitals at that time and felt especially sad when season 8 ended so soon. Once season 9 started and I saw that the three of you were building near one another, I was happy to see you again, although I kinda miss the shenanigans with Pearl and Impulse. Still I was happy. But once you left, I felt like a toy that lost one of its core mechanisms. I still enjoyed Grian and Scar, and even though they weren't at that group, I also looked at Pearl and Impulse, but without your mustache face the server just didn't feel the same. But now I'm just glad to see you back.
Those dirt and cobble actually irritate me
Beautiful reunion followed by immediate death lol
You should've make a k.g.o.o.m.r
10:10  69 levels...     *N I C E*
I think they're called escalators.
Well time to make a fake announcement, about who’s next to join the hermits.
HE'S BACK
Episode 10: scar leaves for vacation
Yeah, there's nothing quite like seeing your friends again after a long time apart. I'm glad you're back Mumbo. :)
watching this video with world's largest smile on my face the entire time
I love it when you guys collectively share one brain cell
Can mumbo bring iskall back?! 😃
How many tries did it take you guys to pull that off perfectly?
mombu grain and scar are back together let the trolling beginn :D
14:54 He changed that as soon as the video went up, didn't he?
THE BOYS ARE BACK
Is Tommy Innit coming to HermitCraft season 10(fireworks look like a slong).
Where have your black screen ending cards been?
Grian is the kind of friend everyone needs. If my friends don’t react like that I don’t know what to do
Grian, when shouting, "YOU'RE BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!" sound too American to be a U.K. dialect.
Mumbo you should make a minecart track over the bridge and you can deliver things to each other
It worked grian back
The XP landed on the perfect level
17:15 that was exactly like scar to mess it up in its entirety. i hope you felt well and truly *back*
Grian still owes Mumbo 5 diamond blocks from the second vault
mumbo missed a perfect opportunity to make his cursed door that he made in a redstone video a few weeks ago
Can’t wait to president joe Biden on hermit craft next season!
at 10:28 mumbo has a nice number of xp
69 levels? Nice.
If Biden is joining they better hide all their oil on that server.
Who's waiting for a Mansa "Mumbo Jumbo" Musa arc? :D
That cinematic shot was something else!
A nice 69
they're called railings
Them being so happy makes me so happy 😭😭
Why did this make my tear up
The bois are back! Also grians xp rain gave mumbo a very nice amount of levels
15:05 of course no Mumbo!
mumbo turned into a troll and was last seen under the bridge
I hope Iskall Returns Now. 😢
it's called the wrong answer 1:12
Yep. All the things I find best in hermitcraft happened.
I like the vines around the base! It breaks up the blockines a bit
Fun fact i found a way to make the youtube icon have a pair of jumbo mustache
You should start the next episode by walking through the vault door…again. Except this time in F5 mode to get a better view of the jump and door. And maybe also swap out the button on the inside for a pressure plate to make it more clean
Every answer “7” or if he gets slick “17” xD
I can’t wait to see the shenanigans they get up too
the sheer difference in energy between the cinematic reunion shot and the filming is so funny.
You need to make a door museum for all of your favorite and most memorable doors.
this is honestly the cutest episode ever the amount of joy the trio of scar, grian and mumbo give me TwT<3
can't wait for Biden to start his hermitcraft series
Ending: a truly beautiful moment
nice vid
Whenever Scar, Mumbo and Grian are together I'm just dying of laughter, I'm so happy they're back :DD
4:27 endearing
9:18
Mambo I believe their called, the things you’re actually supposed to walk on.
Oh so the corridors of the staircase
nice
“Who will be next to join Hermitcraft?” “Uh, President Biden?”
I just want a series of mumbo scar and grain going on a journey
The film szene in the and actually gave goosebumps
i feel like the easiest way to awnser xisumas questiosn would be to jsut say cheese to every question because like yeah that would be an incorrect awnser to almost every question he oculd have prepared (would be very boring tho)
WHY DID THE END MAKE ME EMOTIONAL???
this episode made me so happy i absolutely love their frienship, this was so wholesome!!!!!!! 😭😭😭
I really like the extremely tall vines. Gives the whole base a bit of an otherworldly vibe; as if something alien is pushing its way into the overworld.
xp level stopped at 69, nice.
"I didn't miss you so much that I summoned the powers of cthulu or anything"  -grian 2023
19:00 never noticed that minecraft people don't actually touch the ground until that.
Can’t wait to see President Biden on Hermitcraft I think he’d bring some unique and fun ideas
There goes a little tear of happiness
I feel very silly for actually crying at the ending scene haha
10:20: nice
Your xp  level after the xp  disappears when grian surprised you was 69
Mumbo, those growing upward vines should be turned into those ocean mines from Finding Nemo 🙏🐟
I´m not crying... it´s just... some dost... XP dust in my eyes 😭
It's a get smart door opening
bo bunter bo bu, IDK?? Border? Maybe
Everyone: lives in peace together without any stealing.  Mumbo: Well this server seems to have some lag problems.
Thanks for posting again. I definitely missed your content. I'm glad you took me time though. You should always build the way you like it instead of worrying about others
The twisting vines are cool but do add string to the top so they don't grow that much.
Now try playing ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS, but one player show his hand first and you have ONE second to show your hand after. Your objective is TO LOSE.  Play it with someone else screaming JO KEN PO!... PO!
While I enjoy Mumbo and Grian on their own, I must say that their shenanigans is one of those 1+2=3 as in, the combination is somehow an improvement on the parts.
10:23 his level stops at 69...
I’m so glad your back Mumbo. But I’m even more glad that you’ve taken the time to take care of yourself.
69 xp 10:22
Just say 1 obscure word like say thy 400 times to answer all x’s questions
Uuuuum yeah grians lying. He missed you so much he tried to summon you.
14:55 HOW DOES THAT BUTTON ACTIVATE ANYTHING THERE IS SOLID BLOCKS AND IRON BARS AROUND IT IM SO CONFUSED
Extra early
put string on the blue twirly stuff to prevent from growing further
the cheering at the end made me smile :)
the goat is back!
Mumbo and grians relationship is the cutest thing ever
Was half expecting Mumbo and Grian to run towards each other then have Scar HotGuy one of them right before they meet
For some reason after listening that line i was like : what's entrances
The fact that Grian's xp bottles brought mumbo to lvl 69 haha, perfect and very NICE haha
THAT ENDING OMG
No way you ended up at 69 levels. Grian calculated that precisely.
I was having a bad day so this really cheered me up
How do I like a video more than once?
railings mumbo  they're railings
This made my day!
Nobody's gonna mention the fact that the xp stopped at 69 levels
So good to have you back. End scene left me grinning like an idiot.
iI  literally got tears in my eyes form that cinematic  masterpiece
Everybody gangsta till SleepyJoe69 logs onto hermitcraft
10:25 your xp ended on a very nice number
nice
Starting now: every comment I put on your videos will be random letters  Ece ger f tr fdgfrgyrfr
i like how when you had taken in all the XP, you were at level 69
Put a string on the vines and they will stop growing
Man, that slo-mo at the end made me smile❤
if you don't want Grian to be able to get in your vault, you can make Redstone questions that you have to answer to get in.
🎶 Reunited and it feels so good🎶
10:02 made me laugh. Very suggestive camera work there Mumbo...
I think it would look brilliant if you had some deepslate on the outside of the bridge 🤔 maybe some menacing-looking spikes or pillars ✨
Yay, new video and it‘s hermitcraft.
Even with all the messing around and not-so-perfect attempts prior that final ending scene was golden. Literal perfection! :3
Let's bring back Iskall as well :D!!!!
I am looking forward when President Biden joins Hermitcraft Season 10.
you can hear him kind of laughing at the end
AI is getting quite trendy, i was waiting for you to upload a video so i can ask you to make a minecraft video using some AI tool like chatGPT etc, idk i guess you can figure out something
It’s a splitting set up from years ago love that video one minute 10 minutes one hour vault doors 😂
This was beautiful
Long live that trio!
This reunion makes me so happy!!!!!
I'm so happy they're all back together. This made my day
Grians bamboo almost bamboozled him.
Best ending ever
I love this!
Mumbo has evolved up to a 2013 building style!
Grian's excitement just made my day :DD
Whenever the sculk shrieker goes off in front of your vault it makes me think you have trapped someone inside and they are screaming for help.
Honestly, I wouldn’t mind if president Biden joined the Hermitcraft server
69 levels though
Joe biden in hermitcraft
THE BOYSSSSS :') Omg you guys this made me SO HAPPY. I've had a super tough week and this completely cheered me up more than i thought was possible :') Thanks fellas!
10/10 End scene.
Now Mumbo is OFFICIALLY back
I'm very disappointed that Scar didn't HAWKEYE! them both lol
oh i loved the cinematic ending
Her: "He is probably out cheating on me."  Meanwhile Mumbo: (end scene)
It's amazing to see you together again! 🥺
hey mumbo, I have one very smal change Iwould make to your base. Since unwanted criticism sucks I'll make it hidden and you can reveal it if you want to.              I think the vine to the right of your entrance blends in to much with the door and makes it look really off-center. I think if you shifted it a few blocks to the front it would more balanced. love your videos, great to have you back <3
I may cry I am so happy
Can’t wait for President Biden to join hermitcraft!
Im overjoyed
Those things on the side of the stairs are toddler-paths.
i love how the shrieker triggers when you open the door its like you are in an ancient temple with booby traps and you pressed a button that you really shouldn't have  and then you enter and its a quaint pretty place with bamboo and flowers its genuinely so cool
What if you used a sculk sensor instead of a button? Seems like it would fit with your base
me: "ight imma head to bed, it's already past midnight" mumbo, uploading a new video: "no, i don't think so"
the fact that you said nothing about grian giving you enough experience to hit level 69 during your return celebration is such a missed opportunity
Scar diyng in his fyrst scene is so much like Scar.
Wow honey block magically appear on Mumbo's inventory 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone has released their video today!
That ending scene tho!!!!!!
10:32 69 levels nice
Can’t believe president Biden is coming to hermitcraft
Aww yes I am so glad they are back together!!! Let the shenanigans begin!!!!
remember if you want to stop the **warped vines** at a certain point then you can just put some string on top of it
I watch Mumbo Hermitcraft videos in 0.5x so they last longer
man I can't wait for the collab between mumbo and biden
10:08 nice
I love how Grians reunion party gave you exactly 69 levels lmao very nice to see you both back together! :D haha
I’m excited to see president Biden on hermit craft
Of course the XP particles fills up at  level 69.
Hm eggs you know what that means
The lag on the server is still terrible! Things just lagging around.
If you want to limit the height of those plants, place a single string on top
this was so wholesome....
Cracked up at reunited and It feels so good because I was thinking that to myself when Mumbo logged on an Grian was waiting. It's happened boys the legendary duo is back in town.
Reunited and it feels so goooood!
Scar didn’t hotguy Mumbo?
Those things on the side of the stairs are called the "stair bumpers". Lots of stair climbers had trouble knocking down the pins, and accidentally drifted into one of the gutters on either side of the staircase. So they added bumpers to let casual stair climbers have fun too.
The banisters on the sides of a bridge are actually called slides
1:16 Barristers I think it's the word you're looking for...
Scar dying and then mumbo dying while grian just watches is truly cinematic, now they’ve officially returned ❤
Hyped for President Biden to join Hermitcraft
Next quest: Mumbo gets his sword enchanted finally  Okay but this episode was extremely wholesome and everything Id hoped it’d be!! Mumbo falling and dying right after Scar just adds extra flavor
The things besides stairs? Bears, obviously. It rhymes.
Love your vids
Biden has been playing a lot of Minecraft recently…
Mumbo getting doused with XP bottles and not even rotating through his tools is just pants.
waheeeeyyyyy 69 levels! :L
Mischief: grian Merchant: scar Machinery: mumbo. The boys
:3 You guys being so happy always makes me smile
"President Bidens going to join Hermitcraft" someones been watching too much TikTok
Noice
Anyone who's been looking at memes in the past week knows exactly why mumbo said president biden
10:21 what an experience.
mumbo "not a builder" jumbo strikes again even though the vault looks absolutely amazing! one day he may realise...
final shot was absolutely perfect
The last word of the video: “I’m like a little troll!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Grian is a friend who is wanted in at least in 7 countries for making the Geneva conventions look like guidelines and suggestions, while Mumbo doesn't care and just deals with it as if it is just another Monday.
I find it baffling that mumbo doubts his building ability and completely refuses to accept the fact that he can build better than 80% of minecrafters.
14:04 Some would say you got bamboozled.
Am I the only one thats been staring at their youtube channels waiting for this? xD
a minecraft mod were instead of using your fist to brake dirt or wood......you use your head. and your helmet counts as a stronger tool for your head to brake stone or ore.
10:25 he ended on 69 levels as well...
Mumbo: "I missed you" *Zooms on Grian's crotch*
So great!   All the synergy that was there before Mumbo's hiatus is back!!!
Where is grian?  but that is the easiest one  the Correct and incorrect answer is HERE  it is both correct and incorrect.  Since he is not at your home, but he is still at hermitcraft
If he remembered to hold his shovel he could have got it repaired.
It's so sad that president binden won't join sone.
nice level mumbo, i'm chaffed to bits
i love the long vines
bruh
i love that in grian enconter mumbos xp was at 69 levels :D
I wonder if they'll continue that vault break-in thing they were doing before?
Mumbo is officially American 🇺🇸
I like the blue vines
Okay but why did I cry at the end 😭🫶🏻✨
Happy tears. All the happy tears. The duo back as a trio and what a beautiful cinematic ending. All is right with the world, hopefully more great stuff to come...oh and the fandom side of tumblr is probably on fire 😂😂
Someone is going to edit that sky to sunset, aren't they?
I could watch that door for TEN MONTHS
want u in limited live
Mumbo: "what do you do when I'm gone?" Grian: "...wait for you to get back 😢"
Mumbo’s getting so good at building, soon he’ll have the urge to use shaders.. then he’ll start landscaping his mind! Thank goodness for an awesome redstone vault door to hold the line
That cinematic reunion scene was actually quite touching.
THE XP BAR STOPPED AT 69.
Personally I love how the twisting vines look
grian tookover mumbos vault to spam him with exp
I can't help but feel that the "presidents play" meme influenced Mumbo's answer :-)
PURE JOY ❤️
Happy campers back together to cause Chaos again
I like the tall squiggly things 👍〰️
The cinematic reunion scene is beautiful! And Grian's party is so fun! I love Hermitcraft!! :D Also, I think the twisting vines overtaking your base look great, but if you do want to make them a little shorter or sparser at the top, you should be able to halt their growth at any height by right clicking on the very top of them with shears, there'll be a little snipping sound.
The gang is back together! ❤️
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
[1:14] Foot rest, that what they are.
I Don't know why, in the end scene, with the slow mo and everything, I thought they were gonna kiss
Beautiful ending
973rd to comment
I feel those stairs should've been mainly black. Similar style to the walls.
Now you also need to reunite with one other friend, that gave you a ticket for End Busting, if you even bust bro
the boys are BACK
3:43 maybe 3?  Let’s go…  Tony Stark Forest Green Al Gore Via Hex Coding Healing Factor ME High Lord Arthas Menethil BEHIND YOU GEM!!  How did I do Xisuma??  Lawlz  ====  Haha, so great to see team “MGS” back together.      Snake: “Metal Gear?!?!”
What's more nice?  What Grian did for Mumbo  Or  That Mumbos xp explosion ended at 69
XD I find it so funny that you said president Biden for the next HC member, and my brain for some reason thought Obama. XD Like neither me nor Mumbo are Americans, and yet for some reason first random definitely not a Hermitcraft person was ana American president.
Grian was so "chafed" to bits, good to see the pair back online together.  Also... President Biden, lol.
The best and most iconic trio in the world😄
10:02 "I did miss you as well" *zooms in weirdly*
my jaw is genuinely hurting for how much i laugh and smiled at grian and mumbo reencounter.
The quiz reminds me of a sketch-comedy group called Foil Arms and Hog, specifically their "Getting Past (country) immigration" videos.
That cinematic scene could’ve brought me to tears. The boys are back together, scar’s dying from fall damage, it’s perfect
i am the least suprised
Chills achieved, nice shot.
Grian’s “You’re Back!”   Instant serotonin
....can i join hermitcraft.....
My son asked me to do an obby with a slime block launcher. I'm about 4 hours into a 40x40x25 obby box with 5 courses, only done 1 course so far 😣 but I didnt have clue how to do the slime launcher, so glad you randomly did one in this video 👌. Your 1 of the only minecrafters both me and my son watch. Keep up the good work Mumbo.
Grian, Scar and Mumbo will forever be one of my favourite trios.
My super technical strategy for xiuma’s questions was- yes, no, sausage
This was the absolute most amazing, but I cannot WAIT I CANNOT until Mumbo meets Grumbot 2
Can your base be a giga plane in next season pls
"I'M ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BRIDGE, I'M LIKE A LITTLE TROLL" -Mumbo Jumbo, 2023
18:45 "This moment, this tiny part of my life, is happiness." 🥺
Next episode: season 9 ends :D
you made the reunion sceneee!!, oh i am just so delighted!
I preidcted how both deaths would happen and the cinematic part
Stopped at level 69. Which is very    Nice
i watched all if season 8 while waiting for this!!!
69 experience points
1:13 Silly Mumbo, those are called clocks!! /j
1:10 They're called sideburns
Oh no. The lag. The lag got the honey blocks. Hope nothing else lags.
Barristers.
"Im like a little troll" beautiful quote
I KNEW Scar would hit the bridge.
They're called "Staircase Handlebar Thingies", don't try to shorted. I tried and did not like the result
I love how his experience ended perfectly with the funny number
episode 9 💀
There is always something about the background music that makes the moment feel the way it needs to..
This was a treat to watch
10:30 nice
President biden coming to hermitcraft when?
Nice
[10:21] 69 levels.
Like your vault with wool so the screeches dont happen since wool blocks sounds.
Can’t wait to see President Biden join Hermitcraft next season. I think he’s got a lot of great things to bring to the series. 🤣
the greatest SMP trio has returned.
“Wait I don’t even have an elytra!” *drops an elytra*
I believe they're called...ballistics? Bansticks? Ball and stairs? Ballet Stares? Ballistas? Baristas? Honestly, I'm running out of incorrect answers. Balusters?
Keep em
* I love the build-up to the dramatic ending sequence. . .  * Only for the actual ending line to be "I'm like a little troll!!"
back together again <3
Of course grian goes full hyperactive for mumbo returning
The things on the side of the stairs are anti falling leash poles
Thats what we missed we dont care for big builds mumbo, grian and et al being silly is what makes a good episode.
I don't know whats funnier, the fact that Biden was the first thing to come to mind or the fact that a biritsh person is calling him President Biden
That Replay and video directing/commentary at the end was beautiful! chefs kiss!
Mumbo I really love your base but I swear the shriekers are going to drive me crazy! 😂
beatiful
4:28 omg sleepy joe joining hermitcraft
This is just amazing! Im so happy your back and I cant wait to see more of you, Grian, and Scar together! That ending scene was chefs kiss! Lol! Love you guys together so much!
Blue
What was with the Grian crotch shot when Mumbo said he missed him? 🤔
i cant wait to see the animations people make of grian waiting in mumbo's vault to great him
That was fantastic bro love seeing you guys come back together like that..
<3
10:25 nice
the twirly things look really good
i like being in the back of the galaxy s duos
The boys are back in town
How to Win xisumas quiz: answer e to everything
have you been on Grian's  speedy highway yet?
The not banisters are called future mannequin (armour stand) limbs
Didn't know Mumbo and Grian had a full blown bromance.
Side stalers
omg this was a awesome hermitcraft ep!!
Are you going to be in Limited life?
Bro is on eps 9 and everyone else is like eps 50 or 60 dk at his point
Banisters? Nope 👎🏻 I propose the excellence of my new term “stair curtains”. I will make an edict to correct all those who refuse to use this glorious new term.  Thank you for you support in my stair curtain movement.
That end scene was beautyful
can we just appreciate how his xp level was so nice
seeing grian and mumbo interact again put a smile on my face
Gotta admit loved the ending!!!
0:58 Why!! Mumbo WHY???!!? Why is the bridge from near the vault door, not identical?? Why on the other side it has 2 copper blocks and 3 cut copper blocks and on the vault side its 1 copper block and 4 cut coppers? Im i the only one who sees it?
That was a Nice amount of XP mumbo got there from Grian.
Dont have time to be depressed theres new mumbo content
The boys are back in town! 69 levels... Noice.
Balustrades
A new joe has joined the server
That ending shot actually got me so emotional 😂🥹
69 levels. Nice!
I’m not crying because of the last scene you  are
No but really, seriously - the ending scene was really really cool.
WHAHA why did I expect something like that from Grian haha
mumbo commented 2 minutes before it was uploaded
surprised he didn’t point out what grians xp gift got his levels to
Mumbo gonna look real foolish when Biden shows up in Season 10
10:20 ended on 69 what a gamer moment
The twirly things are great, please keep them.
Grumbot(what number is it now?) will be so happy
Can someone please make some wholesome fan art of these three friends. That would do amazing
On one of your vaults you should recreate the portal 2 vault door gag where the giant vault door opens to reveal a tiny door.
you alive again? YAYA
For the staircase, you could replace de wooden stairs from the side with deepslate one
Treeman :(
4:10 ahh yess there's the youtube short I've seen before
YOOOO THE BOYS ARE BACK
can't wait for biden to join in season 10
That's also exactly how I thought the reuniting would go :)
Grian building a welcome room for Mumbo, making it as chaotic as possible and screaming at a high pitch is exactly what I expected. >3
Now we just need someone to summon Iskall back to the server.
This whole episode made me smile.  And that finale, the boys are back in town!  Yes!  I had to comment on your remark about a giant door completely filling your base with redstone.  That would seem perfectly appropriate to me!  Wealth is value, and your redstone is certainly value.
that ending got me good , im happy to see them 3 again , united and ready to make us smile again
the name for the side of the staircases: Bingle Blombberners (pronounced: Bin-g-l  Blom-ber-ners)
Mumbo I dedicated my entire channel to you you are my inspiration keep being you Couse you is the best
mumbo... you spoon. Grian is gonna figure that out right away.
About the twisted vines i think that you should let them grow
lol his exp stopped exactly at 69
Couldn't you have answered everything with yes? and when a question comes up that could be answered with yes or no, say some random word. This is a full proof plan to get every question wrong.
At the end of the celebration, Mumbo had 69 levels…
1:15 this thing is called "rails".
the genuine joy in grians voice when he says 'youre BACKKKK!!!!!'
Eggs.
The ending made me tear up lol ♡♡
The boys are back!!! I’d be rather worried about the man who just set up a clever dispenser array in you base collecting eggs though….
Grian and mumbos friendship is adorable
I mean it took him 34 episodes, that's kinda succesful
Hey
My good sir, those things next to the staircase are known as finger slides.
Such a beautiful episode I had a smile on my face the whole time.
mumbo I'll be real I wanted to just slam my head on the keyboard to express my emotions but I'm sure youtube will not like this one so. I just wanted to say this video made me so happy its unbelievable, half way through I genuinly started crying and BEFORE YOU ALL CALL ME A SOFTUE HOLD ON!! I've had an awful day and not a less awful week I genuinly didn't belive anything can save it but this video.  man. it made me realise that even if my life doesn't get better, if I dont stop being anxious over uni and don't stop getting absolutely exhausted and destroyed on my horrendous job even if my trauma keeps keeping me up at night I can always rely on hermits. not to sound parasocial but really moments like this CAN save the day and promice to keep doing it in the future. the ending had me laughing crying and I felt just a tad better
1:09 is this calling out the Xisuma short "wrong answers only"? (guessed it) 2:20
i love that the british man said the american president's name.
President Biden!
You are a builder Mumbo! More than you realize.
The boys are back together again, a beautiful sight to see.
4:26 looks like Mumbo's been watching those ai voice videos of former us presidents playing video games.
Iskall should have been part of this too
Ok NOW it's official!
Remember last video? It looks it worked and if you make a player’s head in the ground they will come on the Hermitcraft server!
The side of the bridge is called the Mumbo Bumper
His childlike joy on entering the vault is great
I think the "super technical strategy" for that game would just be repeating answers. Pick something random and say it every time, you probably won't be right, and it'll be fast.
THE GANG'S BACK TOGETHER
Why does grian scream like a fnaf jumpscare
People on Tik Tok already know President Biden is playing Minecraft and doesn’t need to be on Hermitcraft
XP level= nice
Mumbo maybe your door should open portal 2 style and pull up/down to reveal a giant blank wall and a tiny normal door
such amazing energy, missed you!
10:20 nice
excited to see joe biden on hermitcraft!
I am joe Biden and I request to join hermitcarft
They’re called pupstoppers, mumbo. 1:10
please remove the skulk shrieker
Bravo 👏
That reuniting scene at the end was surprisingly beautiful. Good to see the three of you united again.
Have you thought of a data pack or something that makes shrieker sounds more bearable?
💛🎉🎉🎉IT STOPPED AT 69!!!!
why don't you guys make for maybe season 10 a modded season? like everyone can Add one mod then you all play XD
before 1 hour squad?
19:25 ‘and they were roommates’
I was kinda expecting the 3 heroes but this is also nice
“I’m like a little troll” -Mumbo jumbo, 2023
cool
that was one of the most cinematic things ive seen in minecraft, truly heart touching
Wow
Who wants Biden to join hermit craft just for his score to be disqualified/reduced
I hope President Biden is not the next hermit
Is it just me or is mumbos HUD massive
I like the squiggly vines
can't wait to see President Biden join Hermitcraft
Joe Biden is crying in the oval office hearing that he isn't joining hermitcraft
Mumbo casually getting his first netherite tool of the season from Xisuma
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A bridge leading to a vault maybe could possibly have a toll-taking troll. From his hut on the cliffside he pops up to tell travelers, "No. No. You must pay the toll. Or to the bottom you go." 🙃
69 levels. Nice.
Hello Mumbo :)
The sides of the stairs are railings.
wait a minute mumbo was not on during the great reset is that tax evasion??? btw love to have ya back
Bannisters? Way off. Those are phlorbymeeps
But where is Iskall?
Y’all honestly just made my day!!
Mumbo getting to level 69 with Grian's XP :   Perfection
We love you Mumbo! Your content is even better than it was before your break!
Aww what a lovely ending
I literally said Joe Biden was gonna join too 😂
OUR METICULOUS MUSTACHED MAFIOSO MAYOR IS BACK!!! ❤
Mumbo logging into Grian's shennanigans was so amazing omg
You messed up the wrong answers thing. You didn't have to answer with stuff that sounds like it could be an answer, so giving a random word as your answer every time would work.
69 gat him
I personally love the base and staircase. You may not think it, but you are very talented!
Mumbos red stone just keeps getting more satisfying
This is beautiful
it is infact called a slippey slidey funny wunny bumbling bimbling crimby crumby childrens slide and death machine
10:24 69 leves., nice
Cant wait to See Joe Biden in Hermitcraft! 😀
Mumbo is asking for someone to make that door…
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Epic door mechanism. The place is looking glorious
You should put wool under the bridge so the sensors don’t go off every time you make a noise
8.6mil
Early ish
Tbh mumbo should get some custom warped and deep slate tools like Xs’ to fit with his base
Beautiful. Steven Spielberg cried at the end
Mumbos name is not mumbo junbo
Mumbo's been watching the presidents play minecraft...
Grian calculated that xp gain he knew what he was doing when it went to 69.
"Who will be the next person to join hermitcraft" Mumbo: President Biden Me: Bob the Builder
Love how happy grian was seeing mumbo, also 69 levels 😎 nice
This was absolutely beautiful
mumbo plz heart this comment
I love how after the exp orb storm ended, Mumbo had a nice number of levels.
It's accually called: Stair side thingies
This is worth waiting several months for! That was wonderful.
Grain stop breaking.
Ngl, this was the best HermitCraft episode I've seen in so long
The ending was amazing! I'm so happy for you all.
The boy are back in town and ready to get back to haveing fund hijinks, and shenanigans
The slo mo ending is fantastic lol but I can't get over how smooth that bouncing piston door is
69 levels.. oof
They should try and contact Biden and get him on Hermitcraft that'd be amazing
Why is tears dripping from my face 😫
this! this kind of content makes me happy. The surprise by grian made me burst to laughter and the ending, to tears of happiness. We've miss u mumbo, but i'm sure Grian and Scar missed u more. Welcome back one again!!
Welcome to Hermitcraft, Mr. President!!
The ending scene was pure perfection I almost cried to see this trio back again together
10:25 Nice
This made me smile
"eggs" - grian - at 12:28 dose this mean poltry man is making a return? will he come from the rift like grumbot? will he be from a another relaitly? i need answers
man that was epic
actually, wow!
The reunion was the best thing ever
that was such a beautiful moment.
I just _knew_ scar would die in the bridge scene. It's the most Scar thing that could possibly have happened there.
69xp tho. Classic!
The level going up to 69 is very satisfying lmao
10:21 Nice!
Woooww, the xp thing with grian brought mumbo to lvl 69😮😮😮😂😂
The twirly blue lollipop sticks are good, just put some string on top of them so they don't get insanely tall, which would distract from the vault imo
Im glad the Grain is glad that mumbo is glad to see him again and to the most wholesome thing ive seen in a while.
YEAAAAAA
Can’t wait to see what Biden does for his base
Now all we need is Iskall
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS CONFIRMED COMING TO HERMITCRAFT WOOOOO
Ask Grian about the content generator.
Joe Biden joins Hermitcraft
I wish there was something more for like for this video.
8:02 Best moment XD
If I’m not mistaken you can use the shears on the tip of the vines to prevent them from growing past the height of your choosing.
This was beautiful 😭❤️
It’s really good to see da boys back at their shenanigans. Missed u Mumbo glad ur back
I still forget that he’s playing on a Mac lol
Can't wait to see Mumbo, Grian, and President Biden having fun together in Hermitcraft Season 10!
Biden's never gonna be on the server he'll be too busy making beats
joe bidens finally coming to hermitcraft
you should turn off your replay mod recording indicator, it's quite noticeable
I genuinely cheered out loud at that ending!!!
put string on top of them to stop growth where u want the blue twirly thingies. they are good but too tall is bad.
This is the MCU we need, mumbo cinematic universe
Mumbo your are super cool
Hi
I don't know how but I just randomly felt the need to pick up my phone and we'll now I'm here!
Joe Biden Hermitcraft confirmed???
grian scared me when he screamed lol
At 1:14 , they are called railings
mumbo being back feels surreal now.
wow..... yes  ... keep going mumbo ....i thinks he is back lol
trick for games like that: Answer everything with one thing. It wouldn’t be fun, but, if you wanted to WIN, then just answer like bookshelf for every single question.
'' Friends reunited '' the prophecy is fulfilled and the multiverse is at peace.
69
I loved that ending, filled me with such joy!
So chuffed to see you guys back together :D
Keeping with the trend of seasonal corporations (Sahara, Pacific, Boatem), Mumbo should create a company called "Richest" or "Richest co.," where he conducts sarcastically professional business with other hermits to generate revenue. This would be a great manifestation of his Season 9 goal of being the richest hermit, and also quite a bit of fun :)
At 10:28 *nice*
4:26 mumbo has been watching the videos of presidents playing minecraft
Can you make a moving bionical fish in minecraft?
That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen... almost cry. Happy to have you back!!!
I haven’t watched the video yet I better be super fun to watch
They are vack.
May not be the most interesting idea, also probably way less technical than catapulting yourself up. But what do you think about having alot of technical noises (some random pistons going off,  noteblock playing, some lamps going on. Just for a small door (like 2 block) sliding to the side
I just finished catching up! Amazing that a new video popped up just now
69 levels lost :(
MUMBO AND GRIAN ARE BACK!!!!!
I got here early
OMG that ending…chefs kiss 🤣
It is called a desperdiciaron.
i am definitely crying. wow. everything. having you back and the ending scene. i’m so emotional. i love this so much. thank you as always💕
create mod survival series when?
the coolest vault to reach pretty much worthless stuff sick ending scene
so beautiful  (I think that's how you spell it)
I was expecting a hotguy moment at the end but that works too
Hiiiiii
Such a goated mustached man ❤😂🎉
i like the twirly things
10:09 look at the exp level
What a glorious ending to a video !
Grians welcome back party was so cute and wholesome
I’m wondering what’s the music used in the ending cinematic scene?
lol love you mumbo <3
You know it's a cinematic masterpiece when it brings a little tear to your eye. *chefs kiss
0:43 Mumbo channeling his inner VSauce
Can't wait to see Biden join Hermitcraft
That was so beautiful
1:11  Yes Mumbo they’re called *B a n i s t e r s*
Mumbo having 69 levels after the XP shower was just incredibly funny to me for some reason!
Redstone hurts my head...   ... like magic.
thing works: yes! :) Thing breaks: no! :)  13:57
What a beautiful end scene. The 3 musketeers together at last
Dude … this is one of the sweetest things if even seen •w• you two are so adorable together ^w^
how many attempts did that scene at the end take?
that cinema was so beautiful!!!
Replace the furnaces at the floor of your door with blast furnaces
imagine joe biden joining hermitcraft
Mumbo: what do you normally do when I'm gone? Grian: WAIT FOR YOU TO COME BACK!
i just cannot believe i was watching your comeback episodes, then I watched some Grian one, as, and now you are both in the seame one. Also I  was just watching the most secure bunker video when I saw that you have uploaded a new video, i am happy you are back, take your time and pace to get back, huggs from Guatemala
The feeling when the level hit to 69, while seeing Mumbo and Grian along after a long time is just pure bliss 😍😍😍
i’m in tears from that ending scene
And now we wait for the animatics.
0:01 me flirting with my wife.
i love how the exp ends at lvl 69  (shut up ik)
that was so wholesome
I was crying at that ending, but then the stark contrast of the cheering and punching was hilarious
**Peter**  *The creator of Minecraft*
Of COURSE Scar died. LOL   The reunited shot was absolutely gorgeous. <3
Should let Grumbot generate the plans tbh
Mumbo Jumbo more like Mumbling Jumbo
That ending 😂 head hurts from laughing
its a long stick
10:20 you don't understand how hard I was praying for it to stop at 69
10:10 Nice
the gang is back!!
Cool. Thanks for the new video, Mumbo.
Cool
that cinematic scene was truly life changing and inspiring to me
That cinematic shot though
The ending was amazing
M U M B O
That'll be Bani-sir to you
Grian's scream upon seeing Mumbo though... i love that
it's so good to see grian and mumbo and scar all together again!!
How is everyone? Hope you all have an amazing morning/afternoon/evening/night wherever you are
the ending was maybe the best thing in minecraft since etho
Level 69 nice😂😂😂
Glad to hear President Joseph Robinette Biden is going to join Hermitcraft next season!
What if you made a target block to shoot while flying to open the vault when you are using elytra, for convenience and possibly Scar having a training arc
Can you go through your door a few more times maybe in third person
10:28 Noice
bro for me the video was relaised 2 minutes ago but  i see comments from 25minuts ago
"Stair Border Identifiers" "Ascention/Descention Drift Prohibiters" "Stabilizers" "Fall Prevention Units"
Shenanigan Hermits Reunite!!!
HE’S BACK!
LETS GOOOOOOO
The silly bois are back !!!!! Im crying this is so beautiful
You should totally make the bridge across the trench an extending bridge with honey and slime blocks
1:20 gnome steppes
❤❤❤
The ending is the best thing in the world :)
the next hermit crafter will be ME  jk im just dumb
the ending made me so happy, I am stimming so hard rn!!
Oh Mumbo we could never be angry with you.
I'm posting a comment of the funny number (369) to let you know Grian brought Mumbo to the funny number of levels. Hint?
Me binging Limited Life:  Mumbo Upload:
I love the tall blue swirlys please keep them!
Chills ❤️
Yup thats gonna be fun
Grian watched Mumbo's last episode and calculated exactly how many xp bottles were needed to leave Mumbo at 69 levels. Well played Grian
EEEE E EEEE E EEEE
That ending gave me the most legitimate smile.
the 69 levels kills me.
Can't wait for President Biden to join Season 10!
place string on top of the twirly whirlies to keep them from growing.
That was the greatest, most cinematic Minecraft video ending of ALL TIME
“It was perfect. Everything. Down to the last minute details”
Why did that end make me tear up
13:58 , Yes , No 😂😂😂
Reunited at last lmao
Reunion between 2 great chaps was wholesome
Now bring Iskal back
Yay! The gang is back! Welcome back mumbo and grown and scar! Time for more videos! Liked 3 or 4 a week lol
He ends the xp collection on level 69
I wish Grian the best of luck with his eggs.
69 levels.  nice.
They're calls "ban-a-stars"
The ending was incredibly wholesome
Grain yelling "Welcome back!" is the purest most adorable thing I've ever seen
Since Mumbo doesn't have any plans, he should ask Grumbot for some inspiration.
Absolutely delightful video. Welcome back Mumbo.   Although... I can't help but think it is only a matter of time before Grian remembers the deal, and watches you long enough to figure out that that button is the key. Maybe you should get a password on it?
Yoppee
Mumbo you should just answered blue to everything xisuma said
that ending was soo beautiful
a top tip! You can shear the tip of vines so they stop growing when they reach your desired lenght...
4:26 The TikTok’s don’t lie…
With the power of AI, president Biden can easily join hermitcraft.
<3
I hoped you were in the limited life series, maybe you can go on with 2 hours missing?
Grian certainly gave you a nice amount of XP didn't he mumbo?
mumbo's not back on hermitcraft, not until there's grian in his episode titles
You should make a sculk ritual lock - basically a sculc sensor you need to trigger with a specific order of actions, like jump - sneak on landing - walk - eat - button.
shenanigans are back!
Yay Mumbo back on Hermitcraft. Boo Mumbo not in this run of Limited Life, a subdivision of Last Life™
They’re reunited!!! :D wooooooooo!!
That shot was great but I liked the non edited version more
I think the word you were looking for is ballast! Hope this helps
Mumbo is back Jumbo
The excitement in Grians voice when he saw Mumbo tho
Someone make a compiilation of Grian screams, please
Don’t worry mumbo, i won’t tell anyone😈
The exp stopt on 69, nice
Can’t wait for Joe Biden to join Hermitcraft
Pretty sure those are called stair bumpers.
Xisuma: "I wanna tell you as little as possible" Mumbo: *chuckle* "Okay-" Doc in the chat with some telekinesis magic: "Ok, lol"  (3:13 for the conversation)
I think this was the most wholesome and adorable thing I have ever seen
I'm so happy you're back to Hermitcraft Mumbo!! We all missed you tons
Troll!
Nice
That was so unnecessary dramatic.  I love it.
Amazing😂
Mumbo's a troll now. 🤣
10:20 Nice
I'm not sure you should be screeching your crevice in public.
THE BOIS ARE BACK IN TOWN BABY
Balustrade, the handrail. Baluster, the Uprights. Banister is also the Uprights but is becoming more common to describe the combination of balustrade and baluster.
THE BOYS ARE BACK
You know it’s a good day when mumbo uploads
10:20 haha 69 noice
MY SEROTONIN
So glad your stair holders are put in place
Mumbo missed Grian so much that his head turning into a waffle.
The EXP var knows what it's doin 10:15  Nice
Im happy to see grian so happy, but I was annoyed seeing that much exp, and mumbos shovel
One sentence in and Ayo?
Best hermitcraft episode I've seen in a long time
So nobody's gonna talk about the 69 levels ? 10:50
Last episode in attempt to summoning Grian, Mumbo becoming waffle head instead
BEAUTIFUL CINEMATIC FRIENDSHIP REUNION 100/10 WOULD REPLAY AGAIN 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
You should have had mumbo and grian running toward eachother in slow mo and then scar comes from behind the camera shooting grian off the bridge and lands with mumbo to celebrate
So Treeman is your favourite nickname? Then why go by Mumbo?
They're called pillars.
At the end of the season when mumbo proves that he is the richest hermit i better not see “13” bamboo in a chest
:')
Better endings than Hollywood
Ready to see president Biden on hermitcraft! Great idea mumbo.
Hermitcraft 9: Episode 9 - its the same nr
Ending is so wholesome
This is everything
Wow those splits were extreme
YOOOO they are back :D
BRO
TYaY GrAiN
Create your own mod
How to answer questions incorrectly: just say banana. X didnt say the answers needed to be real answers just wrong once. So unless he starts asking about food/fruit banana will be the a wrong answer.
Mumbo Mumbo Mumbo.... please... they are called Barometers.
What’s your own mod in Minecraft
The ending scene was incredible
i saw this in xisuma's short, joe biden is just too funny
Just seeing Grain’s and Mumbo’s reaction to finally seeing each other made me smile :D in was inbreadable
The welcome back moment with Grian was so sweet. 🥰 And the ending was chef's kiss!
Did grian win this round of break into mumbo vault
Mumbo and Grian interactions are the best ever
Grian and mumbo are bak together again :)
just say a random word or number for every question, bound to be incorrect LOL
Welcome back Mumbo, we missed your stinky armpits.
When mumbo ended up at exp level 69😂 👌
Im soooooooooo glad your back
Imagine president Biden joining Hermitcraft 💀💀💀
I really hope for the new member of hermit craft is christdacow his building is crazy
why Grian
like
dang it Mumbo, switch your tools when you have that much xp coming. edit: don't tell me only his pick had mending, i'll die
Amazing vid!
Can't wait to see Biden joining Hermitcraft lol
The ending scene is the best thing I’ve ever seen
"president Biden is going to be the next member on hermitcraft."  *Make it so*
The Sahara boys are back together.  There is just one issue. We are missing Iskall. So no; they are not back together
Eggs... Eggs... eggs?....! Poultry Man!
I REALLY LIKE THE TWIRLY THINGS PLEASE DO NOT GET RID OF THEM PLEASE
President Biden is sobbing rn
Seriously? BUTTONS for vault entrance? Don’t you know someone called Grian who WILL PUSH all the buttons 🤷🏽‍♀️ 😄
Grian perfectly planning how to get mumbo to exactly 69 levels 😏
That one single piece of tinted glass to the right of his base entrance is starting to uh...drive me insane...
I was literally in tears when grian saw you. Such an epic reunion🤩
This reunion is so wholesome
answering those questions could have been as simple as saying yes
mumbo jumbo you are afk
Those things you were calling 'banisters' but couldn't remember the name of are actually just referred to as Scar-proofing, as without them he'd likely fall off the side of the stairs and somehow kill himself, and we wouldn't want that. We need to save the killings for *inside* the vault.
1st
Literally squealed when I saw the title!!   I'm so excited for Grian and Mumbo to be up to their normal shenanigans again!  edit: 10:55 the boys are back from highschool musical starts playing
I've been waiting for Grian to scream like that since the first episode back
Usually stuff lag into Grian's inventory, but today he managed to lag himself into the vault
Biden is the "Sniffer"
the staircase siding things are actually called balusters I only know this from watching The Owl House
Bro is this illegal I’m here 7 mins after it got posted?!?!
The exp stopping at 69 just made that scene be the best part of the entier video  i was sweating thinking it was gonna get to 70 and i was like Oh please dont !
bruh, 2 views
69….. Nice 😊
.I am so happy that you are back.If you right click on the top of the veine with a shear it will stop growing. A litlle fun fact.
Should've built a KGOOMR.
Bro you could have said "I adore doors"
their called stair arms XD
How to andser incorrectly What is your ... 2 Where is... 2 Ho... 2 2  2 2 2
Mumbo for mayor
banisters is what its called,     oh you said wrong answers only
seeing mumbo and grian back on hermit craft together makes me so happy!
bah
Excited for president biden to join hermitcraft
Price love and violence
oh wow I was the 3rd view lol
If you put string on top of the blue spinny things in your base they won’t grow ;)
On my screen it says 2 views lol
For those people wanting to see the “ answer as many Q’s you can wrong in 40 secs wrong “ 4:09
Copper golem infectation
KP 69 :l
Mumbo had 69 levels . Nice .
No way his levels went to 69 from grian 💀
YES YES YES
Grian missed you so much he gave you 69 levels of XP
Can’t wait until mumbo accidentally spawns a warden.
Weird that they haven't fixed the glitch where items lag into people's inventory, crazy
I really like the big swirly things, let them live😢
They're called bridge handles.
69 xp nice.
let SB737 Join hermitcraft please
U could put string on top of the vines if u chose to not have them so tall
I think Grian had gone off the deep end
13:57 that "no" is way too funny to me omg
Mumbo change the bridge please you where talking about how too much of the same color In your build is bad in the last episode right? Well please just change it up pleaseeeeeeeee
Do last life agein plz
I am kinda late but i hope you enjoyed  your break. It's great to have you back
69 levels.... nice.
I really like the twirly things. This whole episode was amazing, Mumbo! Some classic top-tier Mumbo content!
i wonder how 5 honey just lagged into mumbos inv. WEIRD???
Grian was experiencing mumbo withdrawal
legends tell that mumbo is still collecting xp orbs
F Game of Thrones season 8, *this* is the reunion we’ve all been waiting for. ❤
"I heard a pair of tests coming in"
10:22 nice levels
The xp level that it ends on is nice
hermitcraft season 10 y'all should use some mods like the create mod and ect
Heh. 69 levels
I think Grian was happy to see you
Grian broke in?! What!? Noooo! Nobody saw THAT coming! 😂
0:04 classic bri ish problem
Mumbo I'm sorry but Doc builds his Redstone contraptions with diamond ore 😭😭😭
This brought such a joy in my day! Thank you!!
1:16 it's a staircase for the homeless on the side so your fancy one doesn't get dirty
I can already see the AI presidents making Hermitcraft content right now
that ending WAS beautiful :')
Grian 4 Mumbo episodes ago literally be: "SMASH THAT VAULT BUTTON AND FACE-SCRIBE"
I missed Grian and your odd couple shenanigans.
Mumbo, show us your failed creations
Can't wait to see Biden join Hermitcraft :)
Yay! Everything is right in the world!
Perfect amount of xp
When X asked him where is Grian in my head i thought IN MY BASEMENT
Cheese
"How is the next to join Hermitcraft" Me think Tommyinit🤣 Because when grian and mumbo where together with tommy and jack tommy said he woukd join hermitcraft, but grian and mumbo had to turn him down.
Now just if iskall joins back it will be perfect
ball
69 ep
10:20 stopped on 69 lol
On the topic of the swirly things I suggest that you kind of let them grow to a certain height and then put string on top to stop them from growing and it would look really cool actually really like the way that they lock
69 levels.... nice.
I just want to point out, Grian's xp gift got mumbo up to level 69
This might be weird to say but I'm proud of you for taking the time off that you needed... and I'm also so glad to have you back 🎉🎉🎉
Welcome back :D
I would have said bob for every question
The railings?
i like the super tall twirly things
Scar dying there was probably the most appropriate thing and would be the only change i would have made to a scripted cinematic.
Can’t wait for Biden’s first episode!
the fact that the exp stopped at 69 shows that the rituals worked and the minecraft gods meant for this to happen
He's got 69 levels 👁👄👁
10:24 it really stopped on 69 💀
69 nice
I am already done with those sounds around your base
I almost didn't click thinking it said 11 months ago instead of 11 minutes. Almost can't believe he's back.
The xp rain finishing at Level 69 Nice
President Biden XD
Stair handrests
Yaay!   Who else us excited for these new mumbo videos on hermit craft!!!!
Biden in hermitcraft real!?!?!?
10:34 he hehe look at mumbos  XP
I love how mumbo's levels stopped at exactly 69
Those vertical rods on your stairs are called “Ballistics” They make a great Grian repellant too but it requires some additional redstone.
We missed you.
Wow 11 mins from posting and 308 comments…
Did not realize how much I missed this until it was gone and then came back!
We missed you
Petition for sb to Join hermit craft
5:45 "We are doing to make something a little bit more playful" **demonic screeching in the background**
Ah yes the staircase handles
keep the twirly things! put string on top if you want them to stay at the length they are currently
1:12 lines of calibration
So NICE all those lvls...😏
Its called a wonky half-wall
I believe those guard rail things on the side of stairs are called stairs for pro gamers
Peppercorns
69…. Noice 👌
Can't wait to see Biden on the server!!
I want to see the president of the United States; Joseph Biden, in Hermitcraft at some point. Make it happen.
16:00 thisisthe part with scar
Can’t wait for next season where president joe Biden joins hermicraft
4:25 I see someone has been watching some AI generated videos recently...
lol
someone needs to make a deepfake of biden joining hermitcraft
The boys are back together again!  Mumbo and Grian are a recipe for glorious entertaining chaos.  That ending was perfect!
There not bannisters there the Philippines.
It’s good to see you back Mumbo!
mumbo is getting better and better at building..  nice.
Grian was so excited to have Mumbo back that's so wholesome I'm gonna die
After all these months…  Finally, I have them all (Picks up Grian, Mumbo and Scar)
Well.. what comes fast goes fast I guess.  I hope you are not mad, boys
Hearing Mumbo answer X's question with "President Biden" in the most panicked way possible was definitely the highlight of this episode, not only because of the way he said it and how it came out of nowhere, but because he's British 🤣
I can't wait for President Biden to join the Hermitcraft server!
Who else loves the duo of mumbo and grian!
That ending scene tho
Can’t wait to see President Biden in Hermitcraft 10🔥
i had a shity day but this video made my day good
hermitcraft is not the same without mumbo.. somehow he enhance the whole hermitcraft experience
Honestly Mumbo, it's your build, and we as viewers enjoy watching what you create. If you make something you like, then keep going with it. We just like to watch what crazy things you come up with. As someone who enjoys art and building things like this, looking at it and keeping things you like is what makes your stuff so unique and separate from other peoples, and it's what differentiates your style of building from Grians or Scars.
I love how grain  is so excited that mumbo is back
Grian is so sweet!
1:17 the stairs you use to go down
Banisters? I think you mean curvy rat slides
10:27 when it finally ends, its _NICE_
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GRIAN MUMBO RE UNITE
Oh god chaos with Grian and Mumbo lol
I think loony should join maybe next season.
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16
7:59 for the mumbo Grian reunion 16:06 for the “boys”
1:17 those are the ballista’s, mumbo!
Xisuma's quiz was fantastic, one of my favorite hermitcraft bits in a while
Mumbos been watching too much  US president AI playing minecraft on tiktok
Grian's welcome back room is one of the best things I've ever seen
238th
So excited to see Joe Biden join Hermitcraft
Hello there
President Biden 😂
Loving all the new Hermitcarft videos! Keep up the great work 😃
Mumbo jumbo My favorite Minecraft music is other side
Just say “the bridge” or something similar to every question. You weren’t told you would lose or your time would end if you somehow answered correctly  Edit: This strategy could be combated by implementing a rule like “answering a question correctly ends your time” and questions like “what was your answer to the previous question?”
you can stop the blue plants from growing by using shears on top of them!
Hey love the vids I’ve been waiting every waking moment waiting for another hermitcraft episode
Day 7 of pineapple
Red stone
If you right click with shears at the heighest Vine, it will not grow any longer! So you can keep the twisted vines at a certain length!
The random “President Biden” caught me off guard 😂😂
I'm so excited that Joe Biden will be joining Hermitcraft.
Grian is such a goofy gopher!
Easiest way to get the questions wrong is by just answering cheese to every question
hiii
Now this is a Jumbo upload.
You should bring an Elder Guardian in once you finish. That way no one can mine through
X: “Who will be the next to join Hermitcraft?”  Mumbo: “ I ug- uh- PRESIDENT BIDEN!”    I CANT YALL 😭😭😂
I can’t wait for Biden to join hermitcraft! 😊
“If we take these blocks *breaks the block* well not physically”
Can't wait for President Biden to join season 10!
The sides of the stairs are called rims and applying them is doing a rim job.
mumbo unbreakable vault gets reversed broke in and by grian
Woooooo yeah baby that’s what I’m talking about
I have greatly missed Grian and Mumbo content.
Grin won’t make it in again

Looks like you need a new Grian proof vault…
I am literally SO HAPPY that my favourite YouTuber is Back!! 😊
I love how happy grian's voice was when mumbo came back 😌   Edit: Oh cool 1.8k likes, it's my first time with a top comment lol
anti-child death barriers.  1:10
Biden joins Hermitcraft
I really like them
VODKA
Now they need to get Biden on Hermitcraft
But string on the top of the green spindly things
HAHAHAHA ALLREADY
1:15 they are called pathways totally not borders for the actual one
My only concern with the vines is they could be a point of weakness for when grian is breaking in. ie: he could use them to climb onto the roof
my mood everytime mumbo posts📈📈📈
It's always a good day when mumbo uploads a video
I was wondering when Grian would next try to break in!
I think if you added some brighter highlights to the build it could make some cool effects.  Right now it’s mostly a cave aesthetic, with blues and greys so maybe add some reds and oranges kinda like lava? Idk anything about building but I do draw a lot
I'm so happy to see you back on and making videos but I'm even happier knowing you gave yourself a proper break that you needed!
The "banisters" are watch guards of the vault and when grian comes close he will have an irresistible urge to slide down them so grian will always be stuck going up and back down the front steps.
200 comments after 3 minutes of the video being posted
I love the twirly things around the base! I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it, but I’m not a builder and others might have different opinions. :)
Stairsideificators, of course.
