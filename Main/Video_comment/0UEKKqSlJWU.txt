Kiera is nice
dragonite is really fast mikey it flys at 1556mph😂😂
I just thought that Pecharunt was in PEACHYS
32:23
25:24 Gru
I’m gonna play this first, just so I can use chimchar as my starter.
Your Scottish accent inexplicably turns Russian every other word 😅😂 lmao that’s awesome
Jacq (on the phone): "It's a long trip...we can't send too many students." Briar: "You were all chosen for this trip by lottery." Michael (2 minutes later): "There are only four of us?  You have to have really good grades to get to go to Kitakami"
7:58 oh no Timmy sick Moxie 2-D reference
42:54 There's no way Mikey looked at Perrin's Growlithe and went "Oh, hey look at that, Hisuian Arcanine..- I mean Growlithe."  Like either of those are just normal to find in the modern day. 😂
Are any other people subscribed to all 3 of Michels Channels?
Actually he’s not special he is the protagonist different things
I thought it was called driplin
I think I came up with the head cannon that little bro had dysentery
So I've got the phone call for the teal mask DLC, and everything should be working, but when i go to Briar to head off to Kitakami, they only thing she says is "You'll be able to come back to Paldea whenever you want, so don't worry too much, OK?", but I can't go to Kitakami whatsoever. What's going on?
He is not Scottish he is Russian
What's the favorite type of pokémon here mine's flying fire and dragon
45:28 Fun fact: They sell for ₽550; meaning you can profit off of them.
making the old asian man scottish killed me man almost spit my coffee out
I will always Stan Jacq! Dude cane all the way to Kitakami for us!
Endgame reference 7:55
His voice for the caretaker sounded like groundskeeper willie
It is I grunty boy
I'm amazed to find he noticed the hisuian growlithe yet was too busy to see PERRIN literally 3 feet from it lol
17:40 was so funny 🤣🤣🤣
Vullpix  is not a dog it’s a fox 😂
I know this is a bit late, but doesn't Briar's hair kinda look like Brassius's? could just be a coincidence tho
His Scottish accent is Russian lol
Bro walked past the candy apple stand😂😂😂
I got Piplup
After watching him one shot, the whole last half of the main game I think it's good for him to lose!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 lmao
you got 300k subs on MandJTV Extra
2:00 yeah I used my team of full 100 and swept the dlc
The caretaker's dialogue with a scottish brogue, just....just makes so much sense.
It’s crazy how Kieran started as so shy he had a stutter to a bully
They should add a remaster for the unova games and you can go to naranja academy
Blubbery school
The egg is different because when I hatched mine I got a turtwig
How bro got a charzard and grininja💀
I got a shiny scatterbug 10 seconds after watching your video.
😃❤️
Blubbery
Detachable jaws are not standard for snakes. They have very elastic jaws, not detachable ones. 28:06
I like the sword and shield music more
Surup apple to evolve dipplin
Funfact. The malay word for we can either be kita or kami depending on how you use it. So kita kami is we we for malay
the caretaker must take care of the gorls (if you understand  this were friends now)
Whenever I play a pokemon game And I read the dialogue to myself, I can only imagine my family hearing me and thinking I'm schizophrenic 💀
Just to tell you Mickey it's not pronounced carmin it's pronounced carmaine
Oct 4th, 2024: The critical capture glitch still exists because I still experience it at this time
14:12 clearly  Scottish aint even that hard tbh
After watching this video, I ran randomly into a shiny applin in the kitakami apple orchards before going to loyalty plaza. I named him stripes, LOL 🤣🤣🤣
10:06 “I believe this was one of the few… THE PROUD THE MARINES that had yet to actually…” This hit way too hard. Why did he do the killbot voice? He’s so funny
Scottish to Irish to Russian to Icelantic accent 😂
As of making this comment   It's been 1 yesr since this dlc released
My dad's name is heath
11:52 Syrup! Apples!
Exactly why you DON'T change a Whole Pokemon Team at once.
Yes mr Mikey you are special so special you deserve these subscribers
Erm actually it’s DRIPPLIN 🤓☝️
My egg hatched into a piplup, do you think it’s random? Or was it because I play Violet? No idea.
Watching this well after figuring out where the apple was...I feel his pain and frustration...
Yo I love your content
Man, Game Freak played us hard thinking it was Unova. I’m not angry, I’m a Kalos baby
The caretaker sounded like gru
Man, some rando npc students. It would have been cooler with Nemona, Arven, and Penny. Merge old friends with new rivals.
Omg i also made the old man Scottish in my head
Me being a Scottish person and seeing him do the accent I was laughing rlly hard but Mikey did get a couple words correct so good try
Why is Jacq there? Because he wants to get into Briar's incredibly tight pants but realized once he was there that he has no social skills so he's been standing out in the field trying to work up the nerve to talk to her.
Alternate Title: Mikey screams about an apple for 46 minutes
14:03 DR DOOFENSHMIRTZ???
When mikey opened the egg, i thought he was gonna get a piplup like i did, but now that i look back at it, the egg must hatch into either piplup, chichar or turtwig.  Edit: i just found dipplin in a raid lel
Is Dracula Russian
Care taker voice  Haaa ima vampire
I beat it in one day
Disrespecting the shrine of the dead, classic scarlet and violet.
I got chimchar to😊
I got turtwig
Don't feel to bad, Mike, I needed to look up where you get the syrupy apple to evolve Applin to Dipplin, too.  And I got a Turtwig from the egg Jacq gave me.  I was so over the moon, Turtwig's my favorite of the Sinnoh starters.
how do you get them to a high level they started out as like low low levels when I played
40:12 OH MY EGG I FORGOT ABOUT MY EGG!!!
I got piplup from the egg
The caretaker sounds like gru
"Blubbery academy" Yes... that... totally makes sense for a grand battle school to be called "blubbery"
41:17 LUDA!!😂😅(Get the reference?)
It's not just evolution Mikey, you need to take time out to do vitamin training with them or they won't compete properly with many DLC trainers. That goes for indigo disk as well.(Aside from using my lvl 100 Quaquaval at this time, I learned this one the hard way.)
BLUBBERY ACADEMY?!?!?!?!?
The intro subtitles say "Go ratings Boogie Fans Michael here and"
I have a level 100 Applin
i name my breloom fuislline
Time to catch up on these now that ive actually played the dlc.. yes i know im late...
The caretaker sounds like Gru.😂
Or maby German?
love the endgame reference😂
10:54 Yeah, I figured that out earlier today. 35:31 I hate when this happens.
I can't wait for Team Sky to go to Kitikami!
the scottish accent is actually quite good
Worth noting: they did _not_ fix the crit capture visual glitch. It never had that issue when catching a Pokémon for the first time, only when capturing a Pokémon already registered to the Pokédex. And that is still the case after the release of the Pecharunt event.
At 12:11 he says Google it and my Google assistant keep opening up
"Hey would you like a sand-" Koraidon: *Neuron activation*
Michael: one shots all her pokemon Carmine: I guess you pass, barely
Can't wait until he does the new event
You were indeed special enough to earn a subscriber👍
He pulls off the accents way to good
It annoyed me that neither dlc featured anything in the northeastern portion of the map, which is obviously southwestern Kalos.
...Does anyone find it strange that you zoom in on the dusty old item in peachy's shop? In games, that normally means something is important about the item. But there's no way to actually buy the item.  That in and of itself, is a warning that it isn't what it seems. A mythic Pokemon hidden right in front of us? Maybe, but I think it's more likely just a legendary Pokemon.
Rooshie
micheal be like i wil trespass i don’t care for my dipping i’ll do anything simply put mikey is grunti boi
I got a prinplup
Caretaker = Dr. Doofenshmirtz
im late :(
40:17 I got a Piplup from the egg, not a Chimchar. Is it different depending in what starter you picked in base Scarlet and Violet?
I got Turtwig from the egg
it makes me sad to see how bad this game looks
Lol why did he give that guy a stereotypical Dracula accent
You got lucky with the chimchar  I got piplup ( i like empolion but infernape is one of my favorites)
Mikey should do a team sky play through of Kitakami and use mightyena.
he made the old mans accent german not scottish or irish
actually its reishi mikey
I'm watching this in the background and I have somehow never seen that egg picnic scene. I have no idea if I just miseed it or what!
fun fact about me: my fourth grade teacher was named Mr. Jaques (I forgot how to spell his name) and I, as with most kids in that class, hated him cause, he would always brag about his hair being better than ours
Why is the caretaker have a Russian accent lol
u prob know this now but for the quick balls it's when u have already captured a pokemon and u go to capture another one that is when if u don't see the crt capture u fail the catch u mentioned that back in a jmc season 2 video either u or john
Huh. Never thought I’d see the day Jessie runs a Pokémon center.
Ll be honest I think s&v rule over every game in DLC's
I love facing carmine with a legendary team. I immagine her thinking “ill teach this outsider who is boss” then you just prove to her your allied with literal deities.
I love your videos, keep up the good work
I love your videos, keep up the good work
I love your videos, keep up the good work
Who else loves to just watch Michael because you’re bored
Micky’s Scottish accent sounds German. Also mickey is spelled correctly
sum wer els
His face at 40:27 left me dead from laughing 😂😂😂😂😂
Maybe team sky can actually get a FLYING TYPE MIGHTYENA
I was building my team towards having chimchar as my fire type…and I get Turtwig. 😐 Should I use Shiftry or Torterra?
Kieran's "don't come into school tomorrow" energy is off the charts. I guess it makes sense seeing how close he looks to Kazutora from Tokyo Revengers
My name is Kieran well actually spelt Ciaran
I like michael said " peter nooooooo"
For Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 my brother
I got Turtwig for my egg
"I don't know why I made him Scottish...or irish?"  The caretaker being Scottish, German, and transylvanian at the same time
Is it me or does Michael sound like Gru from Despicable Me when he does the Caretaker's voice
Honestly I came to try have a open mind about it. But the graphics 🫣😫😫😫🫣. R just so bad it’s distracting
Turns out I forgot all about this DLC until today. Well, tomorrow's All Saint's Day so... time to play Pokemon again.
I have known Mikey to always know almost everything about Pokemon. He has shocked me with so many facts I never knew....and then he makes randomly weird mistakes like calling Vulpix a dog in the first fight with Carmine.
Poor mikey he an asin in to Scottish
so when well Team Sky takeover this new land
at some points you make the  old guy sound russien
I just realized how weird Mikey's choice  in false swiper's is, being breloom with a bst of like 450 when he has a pseudo on his team that can learn false swipe and would get the Pokemon down to 1hp much quicker
he used a technique i called "battle hopping" (using the fact the entering a battle moves your character to get to areas normally not possible to get to without kor/miraidon / their abilities)
As a Marine, I appreciated the sporadic plug! 😂
That was a perfect Russian accent
Mikey: *puts together a team with 4 Bug and/or Grass types*  Also Mikey: "OH NO! My team is poorly matched!"   🤣
I’m late but a name idea for yanma/yanmega. The yanman
Anyone else Fing terrified they're going to release Gen V remakes wayyyy too fast? Or get ILCA to make them again?
I have a shiny Gliscor
Not the crit capture had been fixed it’s just if you haven’t caught it before it has no chance to crit capture
Caretaker went from Scottish to Russian
Fun fact the sinnoh starter you get corasponds with what type of paldea starter you chose thats most affective against it e.g. Picking Quaquaval gets you infernape Picking skeledirge gets you torterra And picking meowscarada gets you empoleon
Even the best of games can get like that sometimes🙄. Well done, I say! I don’t blame you but for looking up the solution🙂👍
You have to go to the van on the bottom left the full bottle of to get a apple to evolve
The pokeball shake thing only applies to pokemon you've already caught. It's still true in the DLC
Look at the left at 2:38
8:00 I got that refrance 😂
"I will make him Scottish"  *Makes him Russian*
how do get so many xl candies its crazy
Yanma is huge? You saw it in Legends Arceus, silly. In fact, they're even bigger there sometimes.
Yeah idk why but Poochyena and Vulpix got redesigned. Can someone explain it to me as to why? I mean, they look cuter and better but im curious as to why they did that.
Carmine: “For your first experience, prepare to eat dirt!” Micheal: proceeds to wipe her team with a lvl 100 Breloom.
its so funny watching mikey frantically running around with his head off looking for an apple when i just accidentally stumbled on it when looking for polchagyst using the pokedex habitat feature
He says it's a Scottish or Irish accent...  I say it's a Gru accent 😉
No offense but that battle the second you equipped the new unevolved pokemon was embarassing
bloberry
Just to prove your point: No. The Sinnoh starter egg you(or everyone in some cases) is most likely be determined by your starter from Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Just for further proof, I got Turtwig from Mr. Jacq because I picked Turtwig in Pokemon Brilliant Diamond
You may have gotten this game 32 minutes before me but I finished it in 2 days compared to YOUR silly 7 days / 1 week
What if the new Pokémon legends game is in the unoca region and we make the scarlet or violet book
Nope I playing and I got a piplup it different
Michael I love you but your thumbnail spoiled this shiny for me and I wanted to cry
That mud is water and it is in a rice field
Briiiar is part dragon
Can't wait for team sky next adventure go team sky
3:00 My god, the Noibats are so laggy...
13:48 I love it when MandJTV does a angry Carmine voice. It’s so funny! ROTFL 😂😂😂
7:08 remember when we used to get cutscenes for riding a boat or plane. Now here it just cuts to a blank screen w the plane png on the bottom right (the exact issue applies to fast-travel flying taxis). We can hear the sound effect of a plane but can't see it taking off. "Ohhh but look, there's a Dragonite flying by that's cool & should count for smth right" Even SwSh had scenes occurring inside trains & not a fade to black the entire time.
Can someone explain this to me why is his early DLC Pokemon level 50 when mine are like level nine
I love the caretakers accent from the Russian side of Scotland I believe 😂
I sub to all chanls 😎 1+1=11
Love how they say my Nick name kiki
When playing this DLC, I couldn’t help but wish it was on a better console. The landscapes had breathtaking terrain, but the graphics of the game held it back.
the school in unova is blubbery academy because americans are fat right, lol
I, team hydropulse have a proposition for team sky.
I’m glad to know I’m not the only person who got swept by Kieran’s Yanma. 😂
Hi Michy
I do take some comfort in the fact that Mikey also lost to Kieran in the first battle. XD I did the same thing; tried to use the team I had just picked up locally and got *bodied* by yanma.
I got a shiny applin by breeding
That freakin' Yanma of Kiki's sure did me in, too. And, I actually had a Tera Steel Dipplin that I found just a half-hour earlier.
I haven’t finished my game but I caved in
Where koraidon and miraidon got their names: Ko- RIDE-ON and mi-RIDE-ON
I'm not one to comment on videos  ,but  Kieran  is really cute. I like shy people and I would be his friend.  : )   His sister scares me...
"LAGTREE THICKET" had me dying
Technically she has an I at the end of her name her name should be car-mine Instead of car-min
If you need someone to do a Scottish accent, then just hit me up as I was born in, live in and stay in Edinburgh Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Seems that every player will randomly hatch one of the three Sinnoh starters, cause I got Piplup instead of Chimchar or Turtwig.
Mikey is the m bison of this world. "I'll fight you on your level. " loses.
Look for a shed in the outsides
40:23 the look in his face was priceless.
Make a team sky video in the teal mask
Kitakami kinda reminds me of bali with the small towns,  lush scenery, and abundance of colture and mytholigy
‏‪9:14‬‏ just a note, no they didn't fix it, buy if you to catch a new pokemon you haven't registered yet, the bug doesn't apply
8:16 you know? That a very good question 😅😂
The Gulpin’s reaction to the egg was the sole reason why I got the dlc
wow
i LOVE the aesthetic of kitakami. it looks almost identical to a small japanese village in the countryside. the plethora of bug pokemon make so much sense, too. in quiet places like these, kids will often spend their time catching bugs (which is what inspired satoshi tajiri to create pokemon in the first place. it's also possibly why bug catchers haven't been NPCs since gen 5). the festival feels so authentic, too - candy apples, traditional japanese outfits, and a folk legend that the festival honors... they put a lot of work into this and it shows.
Team sky:POOCHYENA IS BACK WHY DIDN’T ANYONE TELL ME TIME TO CHANGE ITS TEARA TYPE Bonus: 30:49  koradion:WHO SUMMONED ME
kid
aa
Who needs type matches in the face of overwhelming power
Caretakers accent went from Irish to Russian quickly haha
Watching both Mikey and John’s playthroughs is so funny. They do a lot of things very differently but both read, “Ms. Briiiiiiar!” aloud in the exact same way 😂
Ngl u made the bald guy sound Russian
34:41 Walcc
BLUBERRY 🤣
Team sky kitakami run with mityena
Glad I wasn't the only one who got swept by Kieran's Yanma
the fact h at you walked right past the guy that updates your rotom phone apps
Welp when I get back from 5his holiday I’m 100% buying this and resetting until I get tortera for the egg  I forgot how to spell
I realised that I change depending on what starter you choose at the beginning of the main game
*Pokemon dialogue options be like:* Other Character: "Would you like to [insert literally anything here]? Your options: - Yes - Yes Other Character: "Really? Great choice!"
Omg the story is momotarou on the first sign board I think 😂
I got piplup from my egg, jealous of chimchar as it's my fave sinnoh starter
The voice acting he does for the caretakers sounds like the eng dub of Viktor from Yuri on Ice😂
Now Team Sky can finally have a flying Mightyena
Is it a Johtonian Whooper if it is like that EVERYWEHRE except Paldea?
Do you have to pay money to get the DLC The Teal Mask? Because I don’t have the DLC for Pokémon sword and shield because my friend said you have to pay money to get it.
Just realized their names are Ki-ride-on and Mi-ride-on  Ki in Japanese (google translate) seems to mean Air, and Mi seems to mean food/fruit/piece of meat(?)
Blueberry was in Unova... That I did not see coming. Wonder if Colress is one of teachers.
I got a Piplup from the egg.
10:06, what was that?
Okay but can we talk about how frejya darn cute is that spinarak with the poison tera hat??? It's ADORABLE
I got a female Turtwig with my egg! 🥰 One of my fave starters ever!! Her name is Clover and I love her!!
30:44  I love how Miraidon/Koraidon’s whole lore has just become “Dude really, REALLY loves sandwiches.”
That marvel reference was uncalled for
7:56 - I didn't even think of that when I played.  33:10 - Oh, so that's where he is. I never found him.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who made a Thanos joke when that student said "I'm not feeling so good."
28:04 as a snake lover just wanted to share some knowledge. Snakes don’t actually detach their jaw to swallow prey, their bottom jaw isn’t fused so they can open their mouths really wide and swallow their prey rather than detaching it.
So when I first saw the nickname for the breloom, I thought It was a dragon ball reference
Wow with Sean Connery as “The Caretaker!”
16:54 Assuming the students were chosen by lottery at Blueberry Academy too, how in the world did not one, but TWO students who are from the town get pulled? And not only are they both from the town, they are SIBLINGS! What are the odds? I sense shenanigans.
Seeing Mikey struggle to find the syrup apple in video, 😅 I found it in 30 mins because I wandered too far east while exploring
40:22 i got piplup from that egg
"Is it Chimchar for everyone?"  Mine was Piplup! ^_^
Someone should use the picture of micheal and kiki and the caption should be trying to convince an awkward child to subscribe
1:53 it’s still pretty easy, I went up the mountain and caught a level 80 Grass terastallized Lampent. And with charcoal almost nothing stood a chance. 10:59 #1 indeed. I got Turtwig from the egg.
Hey on the 19th of September at 5:50 can you battle me
''i dont know why i made him scottish... or irish'' - proceeds to do a vaguely russian accent. :)
sounds more Russian than Scottish now lol
why was he pronouncing blueberry like that 😂😂
Makes me feel bad - accidentally found the source of the syrupy apples before I even met the caretaker, I think.
30:30 poor guy carmine stop bullying you're brother sure i little bit is healthy but you're traumitizing him 30:50 I LOVE HIM
I did not know that mikey was a boy scout. It's nice to know that there are still boy scouts out there in the world, considering I'm also a boy scout.
In the bottom right of the map is a vending machine. Then buy the syrup apple
I just wanna know how long it took you to get the shiny applin. I’ve used two shiny sandwiches and still haven’t gotten one, but found a shiny noibat without a sandwich 😂
Now we have a reason why we don’t want a rotam to take over a vending machine
He did not get selected specifically, he just bought a ticket
I didint know it’s able to play now!
They didnt change crit captures, they’re just only for pokemon you’ve caught before
Mikey can have a flying tera typ Poochyena now
I think the reason it wouldnt let you ise koridon at first is because it wanted you to actually explore
Fun fact: Carmine will literally insult you if you use a not very effective move against her 😂😂
How did you already get the dlc??
I like how at the beginning he said the caretakers accet was Irish but it was Russian
I got Turtwig, which makes me think it’s based on the original starter you picked
Carmine: Actively threatens her own brother  Also Carmine: "aw look how shy he is!"
36:19 no one’s gonna talk about the poliwag knowing hydro pump
Theres a cabin you have to go to get the apple 🍎
Man I originally was not going to watch any YouTubers playing this before i played it but thennnn i broke my moms windshield before i could by it  and i am now in $700 dollars of debt
Thanks for the shoutout Mikey
No more school outfits only in Scarlet and Violet? Yay! 🙂
Theory, Kieran watches the galarian version of the premier league and likes allisters style so he chose that hairstyle
I thought you prenounced Mossui Town as Mossweed town!
MIGHTYENA CAN FLY!
Carmine is said Car-Mine. He is saying it like Car-Men or Car-Min.  It is ok because the name is super hard to say.
I can’t wait until I start the DLC lol I love watching Mikey play through these games
Can I eat the school?
I wonder how this would go if team sky played this
The caretaker kinda sounds like Gru from Despicable Me (lol)
I got the game today and got a shiny Yanma first Pokémon i saw and this video made my day
Infernape over Poliwrath??? Boo, lame.
Now I really want to get the dlc I'm so excited
I got piplup in my egg so I’m guessing it’s random?
Diplin signature move colour changes if it is shiny or not non shiny red shiny yellow/gold
I got a shiny applin while watching this “John luck”
Note: The trip to Kitakami was meant to take place after you set off for your treasure hunt. The dialogue doesn't change even after you beat the main game.
I was screaming USE MAX REVIVE 24:04
21:13 Micheal Uses Amnesia!
That caretaker was not Scottish… Slight Russian accent there
I should have seen the Unova twist for Blueberry academy sooner…, basically every Pokémon they have showed us in the indigo disk dlc’s Pokédex so far we’re a part of the black2 and white2 Pokédex, seeing as I am a die-hard Unova fan, I am disappointed in myself for not seeing this sooner
Yeah...that Yanma also wiped me the first time as well.
Weather ball bein back is huge!!! Lurantis needs it
40:22 Watching this at the same time as I'm playing my game. The second his egg hatched mine hatched into Piplup.
can you help a brother with the pokedexs
That electric tera arbok next to mossui town was the first shiny I found in the dlc. I was so excited. Named it 'goldengrin'. Later I found a shiny noibat named nightfang. So happy. Oh and the arbok was the first one I saw too.
Where did you find Mr Jacq? I didn't notice him anywhere.
My team was Kleavor lv 80, Mightyena Lv 60, Yanmega lv60, Crawdaunt lv60 when I got to the town of kitakami, I had a lot of Large candies.
Didn’t start watching this video till I finished the DLC, but I am glad that I wasn’t the only one to have such a hard time evolving Dipplin
Whatching this now after i finished the story. Got a piplup from the egg, does the starter you chose determan wich pokemon hatch from the egg?
32:02 what is this?? I love it😂😂😂😂😂😂
Seeing you get that Shiny Applin makes it easier for me to say the following:  I got the DLC just yesterday and caught a Shiny Wooper already.
I got a turtwig from my egg so they can be any of the three
His Yanma is strong💀
One of the characters has the same name as me
The caretaker went from Scottish to gru
Scottish pride baby🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  (I have Scottish blood but im classified as an Australian but still Scottish pride)
43:44 - 43:46 is that a JOJO REF!!!!!????
Forgor about the dlc and used my money on a different game ff
The way they treat us like we just started the game at the beginning of the DLC is probably because they designed it for as if we actually just got the game or as if we just bought them as a pair
Okay, so I know dipplin is supposed to be gold, but all I see is cheese and I don't know how I feel about that.
Ah yes, Carmine, aka, Nega Nemona
First thing I did when I got here was shiny hunt poochyena I love that little doggy hoenn was my first region it shall always be special to me
16:00 Ok correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t that look kinda like Jessie. So what if she finally became a nurse like she wanted to after team rocket broke up
I’m guessing that Teal Mask is like Isle of Armor where the levels are determined by how far in the game (lower pre-champion and higher posy champion) which is why the dialogue is more early game because you can access this area early game.
21:26 - 24:42 you should've kept your team mikey
That yanma was so scary oh my god
“WHAT???” -MandJTV Extra 40:21
@MandJTV I got a turtwig
why do you have like three different accounts to block?
“A BUCKET?!” -Michel?? MandJTV EXTRAS
you making the caretaker Irish just makes him an older version of caretaker willy from the Simpsons lol
I caught a shiny applin in a Tera raid in kitakami
34:43 furret walk!!!
Is it just me or does Kieran have a crush on our character
Accidentally ran into a shiny Spinarak while looking for Pokédex entries in the first area! Named it Silk, now an Ariados.
WHAT ITS OUT!,7.7/!/@!,>.   CNN djnskx
I found a shiny on day two of the dlc🎉🎉
For the Sinnoh starters, I think it’s the one weak to the starter you pick at the beginning of the main game, because, my first Pokémon was Fuecoco, and a Turtwig hatched from my egg
Chimchar is my favorite sinnoh starter, but i cant get the dlc. Its been months since it came out. Im very sad now
That’s Russian sorry bud 16:30
"By some stroke of luck, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti all happened to be there as well". How do you read that without bursting into a laughing fit? Okidogi for example is something one says when something is good, fine or ok for example. Munkidori sounds like monkey and Dori from  Finding Nemo. Fezandipiti sounds like some kind of magic spell.
Here’s the team   Incineroar (my favorite Pokémon)  Staraptor   Talonflame  Gyrados  Shiny Noivern   Pidgeot  (also have a ghost specialist who has a Gengar/Mimikyu fusion, and wants to assist Doctor Fuss)
Briar better have a Cyclizar
BTW, can I apply to be a Team Sky member
That first major battle was a little bit pretentious
I CAUGHT A SINHY
I clicked this faster then James Charles says hi sister
My favourite character is the Russian Caretaker😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think what you get might be random, I got turtwig unless it’s based on your base game scarlet as I chose sprigattio and got turtwig
how do you have so many rare candies???
The Sinnoh starters depend on your Paldea Starter
So he got a chimchar and I got a tertwig
Kieran is gay as hell and I support that child
I am late but still here
I have a theory about the sinnoh starter egg,   articles on google so far claim that the starter you get is random but i believe it is tied to your BDSP save file,   for example in SWSH there are people at a train station that will give you a gmax eevee or gmax pikachu if you have Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee  so I believe the egg will hatch into the starter you chose for BDSP like how Michael chose Chimchar for BDSP and received Chimchar in the egg, and how I chose Turtwig as my starter and received Turtwig as the egg I hope I am right if others got their starters from BDSP in Teal Mask
I just found your channel. I enjoy your personality and delivery of the dialogue. You give me the vibe of Jacksepticeye's little brother that grew up in the US, in the best way possible. Similar voice, similar personality but different.
the "scottish guy" started off irish then became welsh, then became russian.
Kieran is either gay or he just wants to be friends. There has to be a reason he doesn't want Carmine talking about Kieran and the player together
I'm pretty sure spinarak has gotten shadow sneak since HGSS. Also the struggle is hilarious, I got so distracted before the first photo catching everything, lost the stupid stalker kid and trying to find him stumbled over the vending machine
So I randomly was exploring and found the candy apple upgrade. 😅
Michael..... He doesn't feel so good
Apple is near timeless woods
Kieran looks gay. NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WEONG WITH THAT. like, come get sum.
"Michael, please run ahead and let them know a student is sick!" "Will do!" Not even 5 seconds later... "Ooh, a Poochyena!"
The funniest thing to me is "shush dummy" "don't call me dummy!" "aw man 😔"
Name the infernape Wukong, please
When I fought that first Kieran battle he was only level 12 and I was lvl46
Im sorry but is there a reason why they cant just make portable healing thingies for pokemon? Power? Perhaps it requires special material?
funny the idea of using new pokemon in DLCs, just to lose !
I just love count caretakula!
Why did he make that caretaker Russian and Scottish
32:56
Oh the chimchar is suprising! Also can anyone tell me if you can get a different starter instead of chimchar from the egg somehow? Because, big fan of empoleon here.
regardless of the circumstances leading up to it, but imagine getting swept by a Yanma while having like 10+ of pokemon behind you
43:02 are we going to ignore how casually Mikey pointed out hisuinan growleth? Yes? Okay… just thought a Pokémon of the past in the present would be… you know… a big deal. 😅 hahe 😅
For a Scott myself u are a horrible Scott
WAIT IT'S OUT? Damnit, I need to finish this freaking game!
Chimchar looks like a new born baby
Had a raid for flying terra mightyena and caught the good boy only to call it airbud
Nah I can't believe your team is much weaker than Kieran's in the first battle. I should recommend changing the team 😅
Spinarak is great
44:04 well that could've been said differently
Its not chimchar for everyone, i got a turtwig
14:03 You sounded almost like Scrooge McDuck
I hate to be THAT person, but snakes don’t dislocate their jaws.
The second someone says, sandwich hey, certain red lizard or  purple robot comes out of nowhere
I got so lucky that I just happened to run directly in the direction of the shack because I wasn't paying attention to where the game wanted me to go I just wanted to run. If I had had to follow these absolutely ridiculous instructions to find one I would've  been SO MAD
Mikey's voice for the Caretaker sounds like an in-between of Shrek and Gru. I love it.
YES FURRET IT CAN WALK
The teal mask can be started at the start of the game so them explaining the mechanics is kind of smart
i tried to the same thing in the beginning but i end up giving up bc it was so hard, so i just swept with quaquaval
The fact that Mike's SHOCKED about getting a Sinnoh Starter, THAT was shocking! But funny!
When "Scottish" sounds like Russian xD
U R OP
Team Sky can finally have the flying dog
Name the Cimchar Ludachrist2
When I hatched my egg I got piplup
12:42 I know how this line will be used in fan art I don't like it
i have background character luck TvT
Missed a golden opportunity towards the beginning for a "How do you do, fellow kids?" reference.
In regards to that quick ball problem you mentioned, I personally never had that problem, I would quite often get it not as a crit capture but still get the capture after 3 shakes before the dlc.. Maybe I was just lucky?
the biggest tragedy is that Jacq doesn't come with us
So it appears that this DLC is alot like the Isle of Armor, in that if you are playing a game file that hasn't beaten the final stage, everything is much lower level..which makes me wonder how early in a new game you could travel to the DLC. I know in sword and shield you could travel to the Isle of Armour before you beat the first gym.
Mossfell Confluence
YOU MISSED A SHINY AT THE BEGGINING AND THE TIME WAS 11:11 skip back to that time and you missed a shiny mike
An interesting feature is that after going to the cave with kiki (I don't know the kids name) the game will put the time stuck as dusk, and lycanrock can spawn in the teal mask meaning that dusk form lycanrock (and the dusk mark) becomes a lot easier to get which is great because shiny dusk form lycanrock has such a good dark blue
mikey: "politoed's gonna require someone else and it's 10:00 at night" me who caught politoed in a tera raid: B)
"OH. It's in the Unova region?, what a twist"  That's not the only twist lol
congrats on trending mikey!
?
How to get the starter egg
blubery?!
I got turtwig
I think the chimchar egg broke his brain .
I love how you beat the Champion(s) in the region and everyone is like, "wow you cute student, how are you so good at battling? How strange..."
I got a turtawig from the egg
UNOVA !!!???  oh please pokegods bless us with a unova remake on the switch 😊😂
Looks like a Legends Arces reference somehow when it evolved. Not sure if that's true or not it just felt different when you evolved the Chimchar. 😂
My egg was a Piplup I'm asumming the contents are a random Sinnoh Starter?
Why is it’s collision in post-DLC story 31:53
I got a turtwig!!
How did the care taker go from Scottish to Russian
Gamefreak gives us a month and a half to prepare, catch and enhance an unrivalled Mewtwo to absolutely demolish the DLC with.  This guy: “I shall catch the weakest Pokémon I can find and make them my entire team.”
I transferred my sinnoh starters from legends arceus to violet
That sounds like a German accent
The caretaker went from a broken Scottish/ Irish accent to Dracula with a hint of Russian 😂
I would call that Russian rather than Scottish or Irish
41:35 - no, I got a turtwig
My name is briar I was watching you video and my name came up  I just wanted to say that
And now we get to watch mikey get beaten up by a yanma
Barely 5 minutes into the game and I caught a shiney Poochyena lol
Been playing this myself and so far my only question is why the rotom phone, somthing that canonically floats, require a selfie stick?
Use a syrupy apple on a applin
hi happy u play pokemon
It was fun seeing Mikey go to the  Blubbery Academy with Ms. Bree-Ar
8:53 That was my exact reaction! Holy hell, it took SO LONG to fix that glitch!
Bruh
It’s not based on your first starter I chose quaxly and got tortara
I don't remember if you've officially said why, so I figured I'll ask. Why did you stop livestreaming pokemon? Will you ever stream pokemon games again?
No, they did not "fix" the crit capture thing.  Same as in the base game the 3 shake only appears for the first time you are catching a pokemon. All the following successful captures will be displayed as a critical capture to save time
Please do team sky
Interesting how they’re referencing real Japanese mythos in this, such as Oni, and using the Japanese word for monster, being “Kaiju” (Yes, I know they say ogre, but they do the same in digimon, with ogremon, which is actually an oni)
His reaction for the Chimchar was too funny!
Bruh this guy is funny
I lost faith in SV after the second patch, so I'm playing the DLC vicariously through you, Mikey. Thanks for the journey!!
Why is the caretaker german
I'm a boy scout too
Olay so I have to reset until getting Chimchar, lets go xD Cant wait to buy the dlc :D
the Scottish accent turning Russian at random times was a highlight
i love your videos they always put a smile on my face
Mikey spending all his TMs and candies to make a viable team meanwhile I'm catching all the fully Evolved versions with perfect IVs in Tera Raids😂
i do love how for michael the pokemon are level 60. for me when i started it on a new game they were leveled to mine who at the time were 17 ish
Its funny, I also got the Jacq phonecall in tagtree thicket! 😂
I wish I had seen this live I would have told you asap where it was
those eyes i said the same thing
Idk why but "hey there fellow children killed me"😂😂
14:03 I only heard scottish mikey for only a few seconds, and I already like him.
the crit captrue thing is only because you caught all the pokemon
Mine was Tirtwig
THEY ADDED MY BOY INFERNAPE 😁
13:20 are all you're pokemon dogs???? ME: WAKEY WAKEY MIKEY VULPIX IS A FOX
Team Sky must come here
40:15 WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW JEALOUS I AM!!!
I feel like these rivals are lowkey competitively trained
I don’t feel so good, fameus last words
Pokémon 10th Generation is Blueberry & Strawberry. You heard it here first.
I still find it interesting and suspicious that there are so many gen 2 and gen 5 pokemon in this dlc. . . I think it's a hint to some remakes, but I don't want to get my hopes up!
I got turtwig in my egg and my brother was the same. I guess there's a reason for the different eggs or something. But its cool to see the starters though.
Fun fact, shiny dipplin is covered in honey, one of the traditions of hebrew new year is to eat an apple in honey and hebrew new year is today when im writing this comment!
When you are an Indonesian/Malaysian person listening to “Kitakami” POV: Them, we???!!!
You should evolve applin!       /j I saw your tweet lol
4:58 she also has shoes that are too fancy! that is not a good combo!
How i evolve yanma
Caretaker went from Irish(??) to Russian(??) v fast 😂. But it’s fun!
Even though everyone through DLC already yes keep your team's when you do the DLC 2040 until you get close to the end massive level jump when you get close to the end of the story of the level jump
The way you almost sounded like Jacksepticeye at the beginning threw me off. I'm just passing through, trying to see if this DLC is worth it 🤣
24:03 for how much Pokemon you play you should know wild Pokemon with never be on par with trainer mons in terms of levels
You buy the apple
We need a new series, gruntyboi playz
I started playing the game today - started exploring and found a shiny Spinarak 10 minutes later 😆
Most relatable part of this video was seeing how easily it can be for your PC boxes to get full and in need of organising. Glad I’m not alone. 😅
i just got pokemon scarlet so im starting my playthrough of the normal mode while mikey s starting his journey on the DLC
Mikey get his cheeks clapped by a yanma.
At least you didn’t run into shiny Lotad
It dropped already?! Man, time flies.
That's not an Irish/Scottish accent... that's Eastern European
The egg is random as far as i know. That or it is depending on Your starter.
You need a syrupy apple
If Mikey you see this DO NOT COMPLETE THE DEX the reward is the gleaming charm which gives you more tera shards and literally nothing else
people really can't look for things themselves can they? not even a day old and he's already googling constantly
goddamn gamefreak, how hard is it to make objects have collision. you know, the most basic thing a AAA game company should know how to do
I have a strange Bug. I have a shiny Salazzle on my Team and it's in first spot. First Battle I had it appeared in battle without the stars and with normal colors, checked in menu after and it's definitly a shiny xD
Keiran  And Unova    HES BECOMING KYUREM
carmine: my BROTHER has been all googly-eyed'' mikey: oh, does SHE think i'm cool? how even
The egg is a random gen 4 starter. I got a piplup from it
''she just whipped that out with telekinesis'' would be fun if we actually saw that instead of a cut directly to you saying that. having no context whatsoever
I got piplup and I chose Sprigatito but in violet I chose Fuecoco for my second play through now I’m real curious what I’ll get in the egg
The Roto-stick is linda uh.... useless. Not mechanic wise but like, why use a stick when the phone can already float.
I love how the caretaker accent west from Scottish to doofenshmirtz
The egg is random as I got Piplup from my egg which is the one I love most!
So in what region is kitakami in ? It’s not in Paldea and blueberry Academy is in Unova but they didn’t say Kitakami is in Unova too.
34:13 the joke explains itself.
"She's like Nemona but… a sore loser" Oh, so, nothing like Nemona? I don't think I've ever encountered so gracious a loser as Nemona. That practically makes up 90% of her personality.
Need 3 Players to smash out the ogre oustin on normal and hard to quickly get the shiny munchlax. Ill post a code as soon as I get 3 more comments
I just ran around and explored and found the syrupy apple place by chance. I played the whole DLC blind. I also found 4 shinies while doing the story. A shiny Yanma almost immediately upon arriving, and the next day I found a shiny Spoink, Mimikyu and Magikarp. Good two days. :D I also got a Chimchar from Mr. Jacq's gift egg. Two days before the DLC released, I just made a new team and leveled them up to level 69 and used those. I chose a Quaquavel, Farigiraf, Clodsire, Ceruledge, Kilowattrel and Garganacl. All except the starter were ones I had either used briefly before boxing or just boxed immediately during my first 2 playthroughs of Scarlet. (first file I had Quaxly as my starter, second one with Sprigatito) But I guess bringing one Pokémon and then catching the rest in the new zone makes sense too. Maybe I will raise a third team lead by Skeledirge for the Indigo Disk coming in winter, and then see if level 69 is fine again or if I should use my now level 77 team. Coz my original team is also level 90-100 and too strong.
Unova the home of ZEBSTRIKA
ill not watch this video completley until i buy and complete the DLC
i want o see someone draw the idont feel so good kid and ms brier like in end game.
Thank you Mikey for spoiling shiny Dipplin
13:16 vulpix is not a flipping dog, it’s a fox
IS THE STORY JUST PEACH BOY
I see that GMFST shirt there 😏
I see that GMFST shirt there 😏
you can tell that mikey basically never goes to the paldea school because he didn't notice that the circle in the front yard had changed
I got turtwig
Not to brag but I found the syrupy apple all by myself
Making the caretaker Kitakami Sean Connery made me laugh so hard, its beautiful.
KORIADON DEEZ NUTS
Based
Watching this made me realize how stupid it was of me to not get a new team in the DLC, even tho I told myself
I got a pipeline
Micheal: Oh look hisuian arcanine, oh wait I mean growlithe.  Casually ignores the fact that hisuian growlithe was hundreds of years ago in sinnoh.
I didn't even notice jacq until closer to the end : /
Kieran is the best, hes great and thats why i hate carmine, she treats him like terribly and i hate her
32:49 I unfortunate didn’t find where to evolve it till after I completed the story. Fortunately I didn’t plan on using Dipplin!
The immediate crit capture is for already owned Pokémon
Bro made care taker Russian
I’m pretty the catching glitch is still in the game. To be clear you need the crit capture animation for a Pokémon you’ve already caught and are catching another one of. Pokémon you haven’t caught yet can still be caught without the animation.
He did not make him Irish. He made him a comrade
Shouldn’t they be under the unova region in Pokémon home? Seeing as they are found in the unova region
Can team sky go?
On the way into the town, I found a shiny regular wooper, lol.
It is now my theory that planes in the Pokemon world are accompanied by Dragonite to protect them.
Wait Mikey said he was a Boy Scout was he a eagle scout
Haven’t played in a few months til I downloaded the dlc today, really struggled finding shinies before even with sandwich boosts, then found a full odds shiny yanma within about 10 minutes of running around the new island. Literally before I made it to Mossui town. It made me feel like PM7
Are you gonna do the DLC as team sky?
Oh! I guess the starter egg is random, in my game I got Turtwig!
Thank you for giving us Voice Acting 🎭 that we miss out on keeps me laughing and entertained 🩵😂
U should do team sky for part two
I have begun building a new team from the DLC as well, though I’ve kept my Meowscarada around (he’s level 78). My new team so far is Politoed, Infernape, Clefable, and a shiny Vikavolt I hunted. My planned final member is Ursaluna.
14:04 yo is that shrek
was that egg random or guaranteed?
The caretaker is scrooge McDuck
I beat the game in one day
Team sky really needs to get the mightyena flying Tera since it is now in the game
I think he passed by a shiny pokemon
Well only the Sinnoh starters are here, but thanks Jacq   Edit:No the starters are random, of course you can save before talking with Jacq to reset the egg after hatching.
Ok I’ve been sitting on this for ages…. The crit capture animation will play no matter what if you have already registered the Pokémon in the Pokédex. Not meaning to sound mean but you and John (PM7) haven’t realised and it was staring to bug me
I'm much worse my boxes are all completely full of eggs and pokemon the game even says I can't catch anymore 😅 lmao! Idk how I'm catch all the new Pokemon? hatching 100 plus eggs later 😂😂😂😂🎉
So when I played the dlc, I also decided to make a new team to make things more challenging and it was more fun, my team consisted of: vikavolt, mamoswine, Komo-o, ogerpon(at the very end), sinistcha, and corveknight. It definitely made the dlc more fun
If Nemona is Goku, Carmine is Vegeta.
“They fixed the bug that only crit captures work” dude thats only if the pokemon is in your dex, is poocheyana in your dex? No. Also it wasn’t a bug that was purpose put addition
I’m sure he’s enjoying the DLC but in purchasing both it and the base game he’s encouraging Gamefreak’s bad behaviour when it comes to making games. As such I’ll be personally acquiring the game and DLC through *less conventional* methods. Heh heh.🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
How I imagine nemona was when she heard Mikey was leaving paldea without her:   "WHAT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T GO I DON'T CARE, GET ME ON THAT DAMN PLANE, MIKEY NEEDS ME"
I salute your dedication Mikey! O7 O7 O7   You earned that golden apple!
Fun Fact: I wanted to make a new team as well, so I came here with my False Swiping Gallade that knew False Swipe, Thunder Wave, Heal Pulse , and Psycho Cut, then proceeded to get walled by her Poochyena.
2:40 To quote the great Alpharad: "Yeah, she's already on R34."
The crit capture shake was only with mons you caught already but with wild mons it was always working normally
I think he sounds Russian
The egg must be random or something cuz i got turtwig from mine
Now if he did Team Sky in this DLC, Mikey could use the Poochena line.
Jacq and gulpin mad an egg
its not a bug hahaha The first time you catch a mon it always tries to do the 3 shakes after that, every time you catch a mon its either 1 shake or fail
I'm taking my Teal Mask journey very slow because I want to appreciate the 7 hours while I can, and I don't want any gameplay spoilers, so I have to watch this series so painfully slowly. I REALLY want to just watch the full video but I can't!
Mikey during that Kieran battle: “Haha, I’m in danger.”
13:04 HOP IS SPREADING TO MORE PEOPLE
Homegirl has the ORIGINAL Scarlet Book, and she's just walking around with it, and lets you see it just like that? Duh fuq?
Bro sounds like dracula...
Have you got bloodmoon ursalana
I love how the caretaker voice slowly turned more and more Gru
I got a Piplup from my egg!
He’s my absolute favorite and as soon as I saw a leak he was in the dlc I bought it
I got a turtwig. It’s not the same for everyone.
The egg is a random Sinnoh starter. I got Piplup (which is actually my favorite of the three).
13:16 vulpix is a fox that’s common knowledge
i finished the game and it was a 10/10
The new map must be Corsica.
Gliscor gets crab hammer at level 45
31:40  Mikey: a bucket? Me: Perry the Bucket!?
hey I got the same egg from Jacq and i got a turtwig. I thought it had something to do with starter you chose at the beginning of the game however it doesnt.
I'm Scottish, and that accent is nothing near any type of scots, sounds more eastern european.
Keiran is terrifying. He one shot my Yanma of equal level. Had to use hypnosis like 5 times to win that fight.
Did you pick Fuecoco as your starter in this save? If so I think it gives you a matching Sinnoh starter egg. I picked Sprigatito and got a Turtwig egg.
I am here for all the Unova references
Oh cool, you'll be using a new team. I assume you'll do the same for the Indigo Disk, so counting the two Team  Sky playthrough this year that means will have four teams to talk about at the end of the year video, maybe five if we count the team you caught during the John Micheal Cup to beat Nemona during a challenge.
I love how he started Scottish but got progressively Russian as it went on
How clickbait again
Michael: *sees vulpix* are all her pokemon dogs? Me: vulpix is a fox
I started playing a new Violet game because of the DLC, and went around catching a bunch of stuff in the early province. Among other things, I ended up catching several flying types. I didn't realize you could get a whole team of flyers this early. I wasn't planning to do a Team Sky playthrough, but if I did I guess I'd be starting with a Vivion, Oricorio, Flamigo, Wingull, Hoppip, and Fletchling. Some of which would surely last into the mid game.
"Oh wait it was Scottish" *Procceeds to the most Russian accent you've heard* 🤣
"I'm gonna have some real good fun with you"😏😏😏
Hallo hallo sie sprechen gutes Englisch
I got pickup instead of chimchar
Nice thumbnail spoiler
Carmine gives me huge abusive sibling vibes. I'd know...
I love that you can have a sinnoh starter without having to transfer it from BdSp or PLA
I personally believe kieran is in love with the player character
I hate that every one uses infernape its my least favorite pokemon because they for no reason made it "overpowerd" in the anime and its also has a terrible design and character
Are you going to make a sequel on Team Sky after you finish the DLC?
Fun fact: Carmine continually refers to Kieran as Kiki, however you are unable to nickname your pokemon as Kiki, due to it sounding similar to a swear word in Spanish
I picked quaxly as a starter but got turtwig
No for me it's Turtwig not everyone's getting chimchar if I'm not getting it lol
Lol Mikey can't pick an accent for this caretaker guy
As an Irish person, I  can confirm that your accent is waaaaaaayyy off 😢
Ah yes, Gru. My favorite Scottish person.
lol rip pm7
Wait the egg is a random Diamond, Pearl, Platinum starter? I saw someone else get a Piplup.
When catching a Pokémon that has already been registered in your dex results in only showing crit captire animation when it is a successful catch. It isn’t patched out. It is just your first Pokémon caught wasn’t in you dex.
42:55 He looks at a Hisuian pokémon in a modern day game and acts as if it was the most common thing in the world. I'm dying.
The caretaker sounds more Russian than Scotish or Irish lol
OMG BLUEBERRY IS MY NAME!!!
31:44 i tried replicating this for half an hour it never did it for me, so i have no idea how that happened.
Have to say, your Scottish accent sounds very Russian haha
I got Chimcar too. Don’t care.  Don’t like Chimchar
"It's 10pm, I don't got no one else" That's the most relatable thing about being in your late 20s I've ever heard
I love how your Caretaker accent started as an Irish type and became more Russian. Like Vladimir Rasputin sounding
I also made the caretaker Scottish
I hatched a shiny Applin for a Dipplin.  I evolved of rather quick.  Just had to explore a bit
Just letting you know your Scottish accent is very… Slavic
I’ll have to check and see which starter I’ll get. I wonder if it’s based on the starter you chose
Dragonite is fast enough to fly around the entire planet in just 16 HRS
I got the Grass starter from Sinnoh, so its probably different for others.
Just realized how cool it would be if we could meet Heath in a legends game in Unova
I wonder if he noticed when Kieran saw koriadon he said hes never seen "another" pokemon like this
I keep hearing "my Kitakami team" as Mikey-takami Team. XD
After a lot of years from Team Sky’s journey, THE AIR BUD IS BACK!
Give us a mikey with a Scottish accent please 🙏
The crit capture "glitch" is only something that occurs when your catching a Pokemon you've registered in the Dex already
Despite the 4x weakness to fire and flying, Sewaddle is a pretty great Pokémon. I used one on a Nuzlocke once (nicknamed Musashi) and he OHKO'd Ghetsis's Hydreigon with a crit X-Scissor. It was the sequel so I didn't have to worry about it packing fire blast tho.
I wish you couldve have my luck for finding the Syrupy Apple. I never planned on using Dipplin, but I accidentally found the stand within 30 minutes of casual running around and pokedex catching.
Talk to the woman with the hisuian growlithe then you will get some quality content
As much as I want to see team sky do the dlc now I feel like you should wait till dlc 2 (their next adventure should be through galar)
I might be wrong, but some 3D models do look different, like the pokemon are less idle and more on a battle stance, body down low (saw that on poochyena and vulpix up until now)
Mikey, if you catch too many pokemon there is an extra box for you.
41:31 i got piplup. My starter was kitty and yours was Duck so im guessing its the shinnoh starter weak to your Pladaen one
I got a Piplup from my egg. Very cool that it’s a random Gen 4 starter for everyone.
12:55 I didn’t know about this fight and walked in with a level 75 walking wake on one hp and sweeped her with it
I used my fully level 100 team and it was still easy but a lot more difficult than I thought it would be
I will now only refer to the blueberry academy as the bluberry academy as I laughed more than I’d expect to at that
“Scottish? Irish accent?” *proceeds to give him a Russian accent without realising*
Caught a shiny Sandslash while watching this video❤
What item is rooshi holding
basically 45+ minutes searching for apple candy..
You may have gotten one of the first shiny Dipplins
Don’t feel too bad to losing to Kieran at the start Micheal. The same thing happened to me with the same Pokémon
32:00 bro would be executed for that in Asia 💀💀
Who has a poochyena level 60?
6:55 you did, Arven’s Parent plus Director Clavel gave it.
I feel like the caretaker's accent changing each time he shows up should be a running gag. When he first showed up you did TV Irish/Scottish. Followed by TV Transilvanian when he returned, followed by TV Russian the next day. And I'm only up to 25:38.
im glad youre doing this lets play style. ive never liked streaming, it feels like too much focus is removed from the game and put into the chaos of chat. and every other poketuber seems to have done a stream.
8:20 Probably just to games feel less "linear" and make the player feel more in control. Though they fail terribly, lol.
But... why should a floating pokemon need a selfie stick?^^'
U should do a live stream of doing this
When team sky leader using flying tera type mightyena? GO TEAM SKYYYYYYYYYY!!!
Just need Pokédex
I beat the game already
Wtf I never got that picnic when I played through it
It's a ROTOM-phone. It can fly, why do you need a selfie stick?
As a Scottish fan, this video was extra funny for me 😂
For the egg, I got a Turtwig. So, (personally) I think it's randomized as to who got what starter.
Could have done without the dipplin shiny spoiler
急にポチエナびっくりした😆
AIR BUD CAN BE A FLYING TYPE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOO!!!!!!!
My egg from hatched into a Piplup. You get the Sinnoh starter that is strong against your Paldean starter.
literally this entire episode is a baby crying for an apple wanting to get braces back
Syrupy Apples can be purchased for 500 coins at a stand in the Mossfell Confluence, which is located on the bottom right of the Kitakami map
As far as I’m aware, Part 1 can be done at any point once you start the Treasure Hung while Part 2 is truly post-game.
I got piplup from the egg in my scarlet game!
I got a turtwig in my egg?
Thank goodness, I'm not the only one that resorted to the Applin printing tree for my shiny.
Idk if anyone in the comments pointed this out but if you look closely Briar's violet  jacket, it was the patterns for the Violet Book on the left side and the Scarlet Book on right side.
Still salty we didn;'t get Kalos.
People before teal mask: DLC IN KHALOS!!!,!,! The game: oh by the way it’s in unova
I did those first two battles with only a Spinirak
Your Scottish accent sounds like it has a little Russian.. 😂😂😂
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
Am i the only one that thinks that the carmine and kieran are really anoying
BRIAR? CASSEOPIA? POPPY? LP? NO!!!!!!! THE RIFT IS CALLING UPON ME! -Jan
4:57 for 1 sec on repeat 🤣
The way he pronounces yanma makes me violently uncomfortable
I love how Mikey's "Scottish" accent sounds like a Russian Sean Connery
Not the pure dark dog fang
Your "Scottish" sounds suspiciously like a combination of German and Russian accents :D
my egg was a piplup. I also got a full odd shiny Mightyena while doing the mini quest for the notice boards and I was so happy, it now sits lovingly in my pc 😂
Me waiting for Mikey to catch ursaluna bloodmoon beast with a very excited face
9:07 pokeballs crit capture to save time unless the pokemon your catching isn't in your pokedex. Nothing was changed.
Imagine using serebii for move sets when pokémon database is better
Finally mightyena can be a flying type
Mine hatched turwig
Also my egg hatched into turning
Syrupy apple is in mossfell confluence
The egg that Jaq gives you is different for everybody. I got a turtwig from me
Mikey’s hunt for a “candy apple” and no one could help find the “syrupy apple” was so funny. And the chimchar was insane
Before the dlc I hatched eggs to get shiny Applin and got it in 11 eggs
Kieran whooped my ass as well
Lets goooooooooo team sky can have air bud again GO TEAM SKY!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
he can now get mightyena cuase he thinks its a flying type (team sky)
Me after seeing Kieran: "Is that Alister's regional form??? Kitakami Alister?"
16:29 that's Scottish? I thought it was Russian! Only thing missing was you saying vodka or Sergei
Are the sinnoh starters random? I got a turtwig. Is it based on your paldean starter?
I plan to make a "corporate wants you to fin the difference" meme with the caretaker and Shrek. here I come, meme review!
Carmine giving every younger brother PTSD flashbacks at the start there lmao
I'm living for how the caretaker became Scottish mixed with irish and a hint of russian lol
After beating teal mask make team sky come back so we can see a sequel to team night sky
If you’ve still not got the Apple evolution item it’s to the bottom right of the map
As mikey was struggling with the syrupy apple I accidentslly found a Dipplin raid den
L
fun fact: Dipplin's move 'Syrup Bomb's color depends whether it's shiny or not. Meaning in a regular dipplin the animation of syrup bomb will be red but in shiny it would be yellowish-gold in color
Its not fixed with the catching new pokemon dont get that animation until its an actual crit cap which has another animation
I’m not ashamed to say I genuinely cried seeing Sewaddle in the dlc. He’s my absolute favorite and as soon as I saw a leak he was in the dlc I bought it
Thanks to this video I found out my favourite Pokémon (Infernape) was in a good switch game
Also... Mikey, don't do Scottish accents ever again, that was awful (it sounded Russian half the time 🤣)
They didn't fix the Crit catch thing, you can catch things that you don't have registered without it being a Crit capture.  Once you catch one of them, you're back to needing Crit captures
I am sure im not the only person who thiks like this: Carmine is THE MOST annoying person in the game. She has such annoying team with focus sash and something that paralyzes you. She also just pisses me off with her dialogue!!!
Kieran's got a cruhuuuuush
If you have watched of pm7 live you would have found where the apple is haha❤
After you finish it you should make a team sky video on it
michael did you know? that the land of KITAKAMI, actually the word kitakami is a restaurant of my homeland of indonesia (and i suppose i have to speak indonesian but you guys speak english) :)
Mandjtv still not figuring out how the crit catch feature worked is incredible, for those who did not know, if you are catching a Pokémon that is already in your pokedex, a critical catch is just a quick indication that you caught it, with no huss or fuss
I got a piplup in my egg
Chimchar in scarlet and turtwig in violet
46:13 Wait, does he not know you can roughly see the base stats ingame in the pokemon summary?! Or is that just not precise enough for him? But it should be enough for deciding on a nature, right?
Golden Candy Apple QUICK HIDE IT FROM STEVE
I got Turtwig, I think the egg hatches to whatever starter type you chose in Scarlet/Violet
The caretaker sounds more like Gru than a scottish person haha
nothing scarier then someone realising they have protagonist luck he's to dangerous to be left alive
NGL That mask looks a bit teal, call me crazy but I think so!
My kitakami team was just all of my favorite shiny hunts! Just used some candy and now I have a full team of lvl 70 shinies to play the dlc with when I get it
Wait. Blueberry is in Unova? And if nobody else noticed... BRIAR LOOKS SIMILAR TO GHETSIS...  Intersting...
I got a turtwig! So everyone's eggs are just random starters??
Fun fact: If you have nicknamed your ride Pokémon, it says ‘You can’t take <nickname> out yet!’
I assume he realises but the critical capture shake wasn’t something broken to be fixed, it’s for pokemon you’ve already registered in the dex
I remember I found a Fighting Tera Poliwhirl in one of the lakes around the left side of the town. Plus I found a Shiny Nosepass randomly in the mountain area in the North while I was Exploring for TMs within the first hour of play time.
Hahaha my first shiny in pokemon Violet wad a shiny Breloom named Onions
Why did you give the old Japanese man a Scottish accent
The crib capture thing wasn't a glitch, it only applied to mons u already caught
Go to the Syrup shack
woah someone actually having a n Ariados on their team
I will say, there is a mini battle challenge that has some tough fights. My level 100 team nearly lost the final battle.   Do not underestimate the ogre clan.  Edit:  they didn’t change anything with the pokeballs. If it’s your first time catching a given species you get the full animation. If it’s not your first you get the shortened Critical version.
I’m so happy, Sewaddle is back after not being available since it’s debut
I just hatched the egg its not always chitchat I think its either a roll for all the starters or based off which you chose I dont remember which starter I picked
I got a duplicate shiny luxio on the first 2 hours of exploration
i love that the toilets have pickachu tail for the diffrent genders
i love how he forgot that crit capture "glitch" works only if u catching the pokemon for the second time
I got a turtwig
Funny video ever specially when u said "freaking apple" lol. PS: PM7 caught a shiny dripplin. hahaha
I love that they brought Furret into the DLC...the best ground type is back! (IYKYK)
Kieran kinda is giving Keenan look vibes from Digimon Data Squad Idk its probably just me
at the start the subtitles say go ratings boogie fans micheal here e
I love that the Scottish accent became Irish and then Russian 😂
I didn’t know Gru was Scottish, or present in Pokémon games 😂
The grey-labled door in the community center on the left is actually a neutral restroom fir everyone regardless of gender :D  Probably, maybe, also for like disabled people abd such? Lik an all-in-one kinda deal?
Do you have to pay for the new update????
Does does he evolve?
I wish i watch it but I dont want spoilers for me
Wish I could play this game without facing the classic 15 fps gameplay
So, you can access the dlc before having done most of the story — I know cause I didn't need to finish it before it started xD That's why they don't make any references to you being champion etc., again. Also, the dlc actually scales with the player — I think with gym badges, not sure, but why only those badges again?! — But even more unexpected, the pokemon trainers pokemon change, too, Somewhat. For example, in my first fight with Carmine, she didn't use the poligheist (Definitely butchered that name), in fact, I'm pretty sure she only used the poochyanna (oh boy). I am, however, not sure yet if random trainer also change the pokemon they have (haven't gotten that far into the video yet xD). So it seems pretty similar to the isle of armor in this regard, as far as I can recall rn. — They don't seem to evolve pokemon though, atleast not that much, probably to stay consistent across the different possible states, cause the wild pokemon are not evolved and/or just to show all off. But I dunno.  Also, I wonder if the pokemon actually randomly change levels after beating a gym or two Inbetween — Definitely gonna check that out
good vid
Why does the nurse joy look like Jessie from the anime
Quick balls will only work if you haven’t registered it in your Pokédex  If you already have you require a crit capture to catch the Pokémon
The look he had when the egg hatches had me laughing so hard I got the hiccups
THIS IS #14 IN GAMING TRENDING CG MICHAEL 🎉🎉🎉
Unova remakes confirmed.
It’s definitely not Jim for everybody because I just got piplup
So is the egg random cause I got a Piplup from the egg.
name the infernape ace from one piece
I can not believe Mikey of all people spoiled the shiny dipplin for me. How could you?
Micheal : Greetings ! Pokefans Captions : go ratings boogie fans
All of the starters are already available if you transfer them from home😊🎉
😊😊
the dlc actully is hard a bit i watched someone play it and man a lvl 100 sableye and other pokemon CAN kill lvl 100
Why did you go with a Russian accent of all things for the caretaker? Its not like this is Sinnoh where that might make some sense. And it was definitely not a Scottish accent.
Jaqc does not give everyone the same egg. I got a turtwig, much to my surprise. I bet the egg will be any starter
Mikey unknowingly adding Kiren's team to his party
Fun fact: the egg is randomized and you can get chimchar, piplup and turtwig
9:05 no the glitch only effects pokemon that you have already caught. You haven’t caught Poochyena before so that means the glitch isn’t in effect
Gen 10s going to be insane
I like the Russian caretaker
The story of Momotaro, or so they'd like us to believe...
Jesus what is it with Poketubers bringing shit mons to Kitakami like ffs jesus whats happening
2:01 I beg to differ! I THINK ITS MORE FUN TO ABSOLUTELY DECIMATE EVERYONE WITH LEVEL 100 POKÉMON! “Funny thing really, get to a high enough level and you’re basically untouchable! My wounds heal faster than you can make them! We could do this all day, and you would not be any closer to beating me, not that it wouldn't be fun. But, I've got good news. You see, there's no need to wonder where your god is! 'Cause he's right here! And he's fresh out of mercy!”  23:55 this is why I like to use Level 100 Pokémon!
Name for Infernape should be Monkie Kid also fun fact i learned Dipplin can use Eviolite meaning it could evolve one more time!!!!!! 🤯 🤯 🤯 🤯 🤯 🤯 🤯
Michael accent sounds like Gru from Despicable Me LOL
Dipplin's signature move, Syrup Bomb changes color depending on whether your using a shiny dipplin or not
You didn't notice it but the grey room in the community center is a gender neutral bathroom which is really cool to see in the game
I got a shiny ralts during my play through of Teal Mask, female though
with Blueberry being in unova it makes Drayton more likeley to be related to Drayden
Little brother broke my switch hopefully watching your I can get my  fill of the dlc
The caretaker voice I feel is some how sounds more Russian to me but idk
Hi Mike
Name Infernape Sun Wukong
Am I going crazy but I thought raging bolt and iron crown were coming out with the dlc
i made the same "mistake" in the beginning and lost the first battle against Kieran and even lost 7300!! but when you win (later) you only get around 4k :<
As much as I like the fact that Blueberry Academy being in Unova hints towards a new Unova game, Unova is supposed to be the New York City region. But Blueberry Academy is clearly Japan inspired (Johto perhaps?). You've got some 'splanin' to do.  Unless Kitikami is a resting point (lore-wise) between Paldea and Blueberry Academy, Unova. That would mean that the school trip isn't just about reaching the destination, but also about the journey to the location.  That mole on the neck makes me think of a vampire bite mark.  The Loyal Three died, but I think they were (or will be) revived in the presence of the Teal Mask and it's nature of bringing life.
I got a Turtwig from the egg
Syrup bomb has a different color if your dipplin is a shiny
Caretaker is Scottish, Irish, Northern English, and sometimes Russian..?
Dipplin is 485 apparently.
I, for one, LOVE your Scott-ish? accent 😁
Spinarak has ALWAYS gotten Shadow Sneak, Mikey!
From what ive seen and from experience, the egg Jacq gives you will randomly hatch into any of the Sinnoh starters. Mine was Piplup so yeah, thats pretty cool honestly. Sinnoh starters are my personal favorite starters in the series.
The 'Scottish' accent slid straight into German/Russian so fast lmao
you only need to crit capture Pokemon you have caught before
slurply apple
Bro turned into Gru
I got Turtwig as my egg.
Not happy with Carmine. She has a bad attitude.
Did game freak give you the DLC early?
Want to talk about crazy raids, second den I found was a Poison Hakamo-o which had 31 IVs in HP, Atk, Def, and Sp Def. And I also found a 6 star Chandelure with everything but Attack maxed.
Watching this cuz I'm too broke to buy the DLC
Oh right it’s out now hell yeah
Michael's "Irish" voice sounds Russian
I’m so happy the Leavanny line is back. I grabbed a Sewaddle the moment I entered the dlc and Seamstress the Leavanny has been doing some work throughout the dlc so far. Plus the texturing on them and their poses and everything look amazing.
Watched so that I could tell my friend where to go to get Dipplin as she has a Switch with Scarlet while I don't and figured it would save her a bit of time looking for it.  I later restarted Ultra Moon to do an Incineroar run and was looking for a Pichu... full odds male shiny Buneary.  Shiny gods apparently shined down on me for helping my friend out XD
The egg was surprising. To answer your question @ 41:35 Mikey no I got piplup for my egg
EARINGS EARINGS EARINGS EARINGS EARINGS
The Egg is random for the sinnoh starter. I got Turtwig
I think it would’ve been funny if Carmine was racist towards foreigners. Like you wouldn’t expect it then she would call you a filthy foreigner then go on like nothing
Nemona is a Yandere  Carmine is a Tsundere
It's not just Chimchar, I got piplup and it's not dependent on starter, it's random, also only the Sinnoh starters were added, couldn't bring in Totadile
michael i have never had the issue of needing a crit capture to successfully catch a pokémon what r u talking about
My egg was a Turtwig, it may depend on what Paldean starter you picked.
When i did my egg i got turtwig
Jesus, that accent really comes and goes, doesn’t it? 🤣
I hope he doesnt forget to talk to the growlithe owner to get the side story with her. the end of that is a doozy
Did you know that Syrup bomb changes colors based on if it’s shiny or not, like for example regular Dipplins syrup bomb shoots out red while the shiny shoots out yellow, and that’s an interesting fact that I just learned.
So, The DLC part one is off the coast of the Kanto/Johto regions while being based off of Oni Island from the tale of Momoichi, And then we go to a school that is on a synthetic island just off the coast of New York?
I got turtwig
Kieren is basically convergent Allister, change my mind
Honestly, as a Scottish man, the accent isn't that bad
Air buds in the game!
Yes  He is using infernape (my fav Pokémon)
Who are you. Team sky intro plays well I'm the leader of team sky
In asian culture in real life, the colour blue is feminine, representing water and yin. While red (even pink) is masculine represents fire and yang.
Ok wth did I do wrong? I'm staring at an empty loyalty plaza, no signboard in sight. Did I miss something ? Edit; rebooted the game and it appeared. Super worth the wait for immediate glitches 😂
Bro sounds like Gru when he talks as the caretaker
Unless it was in a previous gen i thought Polywarth could learn mind reader or some other move which helped dynamic punch
Michael, you can get the dipplin evo item from a little unmanned shop at the south eastern most point of the map!
The most hilarious part of this video is how much he struggles to get the evolution of the Pokémon, and then ultimately says that they don’t care about any of the details regarding that Pokémon.
The reason it keeps giving you beginner stuff is because you can go there as soon as you start the treasure hunt, and I believe the levels only become that high in the post game
Wait does anyone know why mickey wears a hat in every of his video
You have to do Team Sky but in Bugsnax!
I watching this after playing to see if the sinnoh starter egg is based off the paldea starter and I think it is. I had the same genuinely surprised and bewildered reaction.
I think a few people dislike Carmine given how she treats her brother
Ok Mikey, there's a bit of a difference with Celtic accents, Irish for example is a bit lighter and kinda feminine though depends on the dialect, similarly a Scottish accent is a bit heavier think shrek for example
My husband and i both got Turtwig and so did PM7 so we really thought that was just it. Good to know it's any of the starters
"It's a dark and stormy night" Oh that's not that bad, I love the rain! "Deep in lag tree thicket" OH GOD THE HORRORS
OMG
I had the exact same problem with Kierans Yanma lol it swept my whole team except for my starter during the fight over trying to get the teal mask back from him. After that battle I spent like 45 minutes racking my brain for answers and ended up adding Mamoswine to my team but damn it feels like literally everything in this DLC is weak to Yanma lol
A woman talking about rich resources and she's from the Unova region. Yeah that's not sus at all
"Gotta fill out that pokedex!"  He's more right than he knows
Picnic tips:  Get all the tablecloths in paldea, and you can talk to a man outside Kitakami Hall by the picnic station and he will give you chairs to match every single tablecloth pattern you have!
The reason the you didn't get a Critical Capture is because it was the first time you caught the Pokemon. If you've never caught it a crit capture can work for some reason.
I was assuming kitakami was going to be in that area which was unclimbable
I’m curious why random characters get to go but the friends we made along the way can’t come- was that a writing decision
Blubbery Academy Also can we hear it for the Russian-Scottish Caretaker
My egg was a piplup! So I’m assuming everyone gets a different starter
Ah yes. My favorite fruit. A Blubbery.
I got piplup from my egg, I wonder if it’s random or different based on violet/Scarlett
I beat the dlc I hope meeting jacq isn’t too late
Hello! My son was looking for the Syrupy Apple as well and found it, thanks to you! He has a shiny Applin as well so he was stoked. Thank you for the help!
To Mikey: The egg Jacq gives you hatches into a random Sinnoh starter. So you could've ended up with Turtwig or Piplup
Kind of sad it seems everyone gets chimchar from that egg. I got in both violet and scarlet, and every YouTuber I’ve seen gets chimchar. I want my baby turtwig 😭
air bud coming back to team sky
The egg that Jacq gives you can be one of the three Sinnoh starters. I got a Turtwig.
Pokemon home also had an update
Why can't they say there is a trip but you can't attend cause you are bad at school? Or something like that
we got the greetings boggie fans LETS GOOOOO
I think Jacq gives a different starter to everyone. I got a turtwig from him and my boyfriend got piplup.
Number 17 on trending! Huge! Congratulations, Michael!
I love the fact Carmine seems so arrogant but deep down with her dialogue she's just looking out for her little brother as she wants him to be a good trainer but seems strict only because she cares behind her masking
14:27 Idk maybe a mixture of Russian and scottis
I really want to watch this… but I’ve had classes all day and I haven’t had a chance to play it myself yet >:(
Team Sky can have a flying Terra Mightyena now with Tera Shards!!!! Lol
name infernape Ludacris for nostalgia
great vid keep up the good work👍
While playing I caught 2 shiny cramorant in 5 minutes it was crazy
Thank you for letting me see possibly the first ever yanma sweep.
So many people are getting route one shinies, and mine was a swinub in a small cave under the mountain
why is the shiny dipplin spoiled in the thumbnail?? i haven't even seen it yet...thx
Y does his Scottish accent sound like gru?😂
Love the vid! As an FYI, I don't think they fixed the bug that showed the crit capture animation even if it's not a crit. It has always only applied to pokemon you haven't caught before. If you caught the Pokemon previously, it still shows only the crit animation.
Hi
Knowing that i may never be able to play this, it is really fun to watch others play this.
I got a piplup from the egg
The caretaker went from Scottish to Russian lol
I got a piplup from the egg so I think it's a random one of the gen four starters.
Carmine gives off tsundere vibes
I don't know why, but everytime Mikey speaks for the Caretaker, I hear Gru from Despicable Me
INFERNAPE IS IN THE GAME! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
With my egg, I ended up with a piplup! My original starter for Violet was the fire croc so maybe it has to do with your starter chosen in the main game?
I got Turtwig from that egg
Bro I did not know about chimchar  being in this game for free, I better find him
in the first 10 minutes of the dlc. i got a shiny applin
41:34 no it’s actually not JUST chimchar its any of the sinnoh starters
My egg was a piplup but I picked Sprigatitto as my starter. It’s probably the sinnoh starter that’s weak to your Paldaen starter.
the apple is in bottom right of map
32:02 ZOOPIDY DOOP is so funny
That is a Russian accent
just wait until u see operons backstory and face.
Yup first instinct catch all pokemon within immediate vicinity,  you hatched chimchar I hatched turtwig
30:53 Godzilla exist confirmed
YOOO THIS 18 ON TRENDING GOOD JOB MATE!
I enjoyed the DLC a lot, but it makes me CRAVE the final DLC to be released NOW lmao  I completed the story and the entire dex minus the trade evos in just about 3 hours as well
I hatched Turtwig. Wish it would’ve been one of the other two. As I already have 2 grass types on my team.
YOU NEED TO DO TEAM SKY DLC
And yanmega is very good also people said he suck but i beat a game with only 3 pokemon with it before
Michael! A Unovan teacher = Unova legends game??!!!
I already have Yanmega this game is insane
Giving a Japanese character a ??? European accent is crazy
The awkward ‘cool enough to.. get a subscriber?’ Made me chuckle and double check if I was subbed to this channel already 😂 (i was)
Can't wait to play this!
I ship jacq and briar
CONGRATS ON #21 ON TRENDING
All I can say to you is THANK YOU for notifying me of the existence of the sinnoh starters in the DLC
Oh, look at that. A Hisuian Arcanine... er, Growlithe I mean."- Mikey 2023  Take a close look at who's standing next to Hisuian Growlithe,  you might be surprised!
Oh that's cool I also caught a whole new team, but I kept Koraidon in battle mode until the newbies were up to speed just in case. Seems my concerns were warranted.
This is way more Eastern European now.
YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Team Sky?
Hopefully Infernape’s name is Ludicris the 3rd.
That russian-italian-scottish accent is just great, more please!! 😂😂😂
I full on cackled when Mikey brought out the random Scottish accent.
Is it just me or does dripplin kinda looks like Skibidi Toilet?
they fixed the crit capture shake for the quickball sometime ago
Can't you give them mints to adjust the speed lowering?
Or forest
Go to a woods
That second battle was not how I expected things to go 😂
Nemona is gonna be pissed when she sees you battling Carmine
For months... it was announced that all the starters would be within this DLC and would be easy to obtain... and here, you are confused... XD Well, it happens to anyone. :D
The pokemon u get from the egg is the sinnon starter that is weak to your starter . I picked the fire starter and got turtwig from the egg or I could be wrong and it was random.
So...the bug was when you use a quick ball or a repeat ball on a pokemox that is ALREADY REGISTERED in the pokedex the pokeball selected would fail if it didn't do the critical capture. (If it is a newly registered pokemon, it will work even without a critical capture.)
🍑🍱🍘🧋you:)
Did he...miss the hisuian Growlith? Ya he saw it but, did he thought of that?
To be honest, this DLC was boring af. It's basically just "go here, read dialogue, now go here, read dialogue." I know that's basically every Pokemon game, but this is DLC. 6/10 (although, since I got a shiny slugma, it's now 7/10)
I can't believe Mikey lost to Kieran lol
Mate the base stat total for dipplin is 485, yeah
I see the game still looks like shit 😢
You can get a blood moon
I need a blood moon Ursula In the teal mask
“I will eat you demon squirrel”
I made a mostly new team… Chuster from my team, Kubfu, Galar Slowpoke, and now Corphish, Cutiefly, and Swadloon
Kieran IS EVERYTHING 🥺
I love how Michael basically made the caretaker Shrek
I got piplup from my egg so its different
The egg is based on the starter you got. Water gets fire fire gets grass and grass gets water.
i would buy this but im saving for totk
Love the videos. I can't wait to see if you read any of the dex entry for the new and old pokemon.
oh hey he’s trending… 👍🏼
36:07 Wonderful for Mikeytikami Team
Played a bit too much today and got the new Ursaluna. Honestly wonder how many others names it Freddy😂😂
The crit capture fail is only for Pokemon you have already caught. With all the new Pokemon you haven't caught the first time won't crit cap.
I need shiny dipplin now
Name it Driplin
Man became god and teleport there
Your Scottish accent is phenomenal! 😊
I found a way to get the candy apple go to the bottom right of your map and find the house there they are selling candy apples
It's not chimchar for everyone, I got a stupid piplup
m o k e
Unova = U.S. Rice Paddies = Asia U.S. + Asia = American Phillipines *IMPERIALISM INTENSIFIES*
when i got to apple hill i was just exploring and grabbing the items and came across a full odds shiny poochyena
I skipped the book part because i forgot that most of that was greyed out.
Putting the shiny in the thumbnail, really bro?
Lol I played the entire thing it was great
21:40 his regrets.
Mikey it's Car-Mine not Carmen Carmine is pronounced how it's spelt.
My first shiny in the dlc was poochyena. I'm glad because it looks like my dog.
You only need the critical capture if you have already registered it to the dex.
Carmine definitely has a crush on the player
Btw the quick ball only has to crit capture if you already caught it
Dipplin’s exclusive move also changes also changes when its shiny. 😊
Syurpy apple is sold at a stand at a farm
When I hold back it’s like I’m not holding back as well I’m not holding back there in about two seconds remote and back it takes five so yeah most of my Pokémon to level 100 or above don’t know how are you can get over level 100 Pokémon in this game but somehow I managed to do it also In Minecraft you can get negative diamonds that’s right you can oh Minecraft diamonds you can be broke in Minecraft
Did anyone else think of gen 5 remakes when they said blueberry academy was in unova
Whenever you get 150 Pokemon in the teal mask dex you might want to go talk to the girl with the huisian growlithe as that will trigger a side quest that will reward you with a Pokemon I think you will like
I caught a poochyana and named it sky for team sky
Syrupy Apples can be purchased for 500 coins at a stand in the Mossfell Confluence, which is located on the bottom right of the Kitakami map
Mickey mouse's caretaker voice sounds like gru☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
The capture only look critical if you already have them registered
So nobody is gonna talk about how Kieran and Carmine just kinda vanished at 12:03
41:34 I actually came to watch this video for that purpose. I got a Piplup
Call the infernape ludachrisy. A throwback to your first nuzlocke. But it’s a girl so call it ludachrisy.
the crit capture isn’t a glitch it’s just that once you catch a pokémon if you catch it successfully it will crit to save time on the animation
12:20 OH BOY. ANOTHER NEMONA. >:C
I feel like this new region is near johto
Thanks for spoiling the Dipplin shiny in your thumbnail… 🤬
Can't wait for the next ep. I got the water starter from my egg
Nope the egg is random between the sinnoh starters
Love that Darkrai is now in SV after the release of Teal Mask 😁
guess i’m getting spoiled today
Funny moments: Told YoU tO HusH KIKI! THE Way Carmine speaks is hilarious If you're naughty.. Aw ma gawd I just need that... FReaKinG AppLE
Michael: Poochyena counted for 90?? Me: 89 of the paldean are carried over to Kitakami
Mikey: **tries to give the caretaker a "Scottish" accent** Every Russian: *..And I Took That Personally*
Lol 6.9 k likes remove the . guys
Is there an algorithm philosophy to why Michaels face is in the top left and not the top right?  I'm sure there is some sort of strategic reasoning. Please advise
DLC is level based I just started it with a new game
Crit capture only work for the one you have caught
Man I wish I had the dlc I’m crying but I love your videos keep up the work!
If you go to the southeast corner of the map there is a stand where you can buy syrup apples to evolve Applin to Dipplin. Also I love your content!
I got two shinies lotad and nosepass
I don’t think of Paldea the same anymore since the dlc dropped
I replied to Jacq, with "What is it?" for the giggles.
I love that scald is back
For Dipplin, you need to buy a syrup apple from a shop in the city.
Michael always goes all out on the acting and Precision so nice to just see him let loose & be himself
if I am correct for the first time EVER a Pokemon's move animation changes whether the Pokemon is shiny or not, diplin syrup bomb animation is nornaly red like diplins syrup color but shiny diplin has gold syrup and the move syrup bomb becomes GOLDEN!!!!! They really didn't have to do that at all but they did, I will always love Pokemon! 😁
I love how your irish/scottish accent slowly turned more russian😂. Great video!
OH MY GOSH!!!! Chimchar is my ALL TIME favourite starter!!!! I am SO happy i can get him in scarlet and violet!!❤❤ THANK YOU FOR BLESSING ME WITH THIS NEWS❤❤
Love how it went from Scottish to Russian
Keiran didn't startle Micheal, he startled me!,
Please do team sky on this and he’s after the legendary bird
oh so we will get unova remakes then, no reason blueberry academy is there otherwise
The starters must be random for everyone, cause I got a piplup from my egg.
In case anyone was curious that chingling "cake/salad" is actually a flower arrangement. I walked up to it and pressed A and it said it was made of flowers. It's not game breaking information but if anyone was curious, that's what it is.
Mikey, the next step once you finish this is to do a Team Sky playthrough of the DLC. In the violet episode you talked about wanting a flying type Mightyena, and now he can have one. Once you finish this DLC I cannot wait to see Team Sky turn Mightyena into, as team sky would say it, *ahem* “A CREATURE OF THE SKYYYYYY!!!”  Edit: since team night sky said he would return, make team night sky return too if yall like the idea like so he can see
I caught a grub in because I wanted to use a cola volt but the less than 5 minutes later I caught a shiny cutiefly so I don’t know what to use
Ghetto Nurse Joy is my fav
crit quick is for mons in your dex
I got Piplup from egg.
I'm sorry not trying to glote but I played a lot of this already and after just 20 mins I found a shiny yanma
My egg hatched into a Turtwig, which was a fun surprise! Not sure if it picks from all the starters or just the Sinnoh ones...
Go rating boogie fans
You've turned the caretaker into Gru HFJDJSGFJKDS
I’m not the greatest fan of scarlets and violets “art style” like for the most part, I had a great time with the base game I just don’t like how it looks   Edit: I should clarify, the models look good it’s the npc’s and overworld I think look weird
44:04 “I must get higher”                       -mickey 2023
7:55  That was uncalled for I just watched infinity war and now I’m sad again 😢
Yeah, that Yanma destroyed me to I only had Girafrig Klawf and Appline on my team, Luckily After a few max revives, Klawf tanked a Giga Drain
For the egg i got piplup
I love dripplin’s shiny form. I had also captured a shiny applin so I can get one. Their are two things I like about it’s shiny. The first is that because of its outer syrup being yellow you can see the red apple underneath. And the other is how the leaves on its tail turn red.
YES IT WAS WORTH IT CUTIEFLY
9:04 Actually, it's not a bug. If you catch a species of Pokémon you've already registered in your Dex, all future successful captures of that species will APPEAR as crit captures, not that they necessarily ARE crit captures. I guess they did that so you wouldn't have to wait the whole 3 shakes if you've already caught that Pokémon before. So since this was the first Poochyena you've caught, it displayed the standard 3-shake animation. So now anytime you catch Poochyena in the future, successful captures will be displayed as critical captures.
Shiny dipplin is amazing 😍 And the egg I got was a piplup 😮 I didn't realise you can get the others
shoulda used revives
When is team sky dlc
please call the Infernape after it's inspiration: Son-wukong
31:54 Bruh XD
weird coincidence i was also in the lag tree thicket whe i got the dlc
On Apple Hill second Apple Orchard on your on your right
Strangely enough when I got the egg from Jacq it hatched as a Piplup. One things to note and that is from BDSP, because you choice chimchar in that game and your egg hatch as a chimchar. For me I choice Piplup in that game and the same thing
I found a shiny Poochyena about 10 minutes into the DLC. No sandwich, no outbreak, just Shiny Charm odds.
The egg from jacq isn’t guaranteed to be a chimchar. I got piplup from it.
I already beat the teal mask and it was really good! Now I'm just trying to complete the dex
Blueberry academy in unova, legends unova or black and white remakes in general confirmed
I had a feeling it would be in unova but it was still cool to find out that it was
Please name your spinarak nab Nab also please play Garten of Bam Bam that's where the name is from
Can only assume the Sinnoh starter you get is based on your original starter
Can’t wait for the zebstrika and the flying Tera mightyena
I did the first few battles with my main team before finally making the decision to use a new one. Wish I made it before but it's better late than never
12:46 This is the only trainer Battle I did so far. One shot Poochyena with Close Combat with Kubfu three shot Vulpix with surf due to crit from Galarian Slowpoke, and one shot Poltchagiest with Thief from my Level 100 Pikachu
Purple gulpin
so about the critical capture animation from what I know, if you didn't register the pokemon in you dex then it will be like the older games, but if you have registered it it will have the critical capture animation if you have successfully captured it and regular shakes if you failed.
Thank you for releasing this in parts. I started playing the dlc but didnt get time to finish. I've been avoiding spoilers so this is perfect.  I was also shocked by the starter in the egg...though I didnt know they were random. I got a piplup and thought i'd just end up getting more eggs as the story progressed. Guess ill be doing some trading. Looking forward to the next part since I did get farther than this.
Not watching because of spoilers
Considering Dipplin's stats, i guess a "Quiet" nature would be better for it. As for it's moveset for a gameplay, i guess  - Dragon Pulse/Draco Meteor - Energy Ball/Giga Drain/Leaf Storm - Pollen Puff - Gyro Ball/Recover/Grassy Terrain "Syrup Bomb" is it's signature move, but it's weak at 60 BP and 85% Accuracy.
POOCHEYENA!!!!!!! TEAM SKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Lagtree Thicket" had me crying 😂
9:04 That might be because you haven’t CAUGHT it yet!
Oh i didnt know it released already lol
I love Mikey’s energy in this
He caught me off guard with the Marines Spotify ad
Mikey why is your Scottish accent just muffled Russian?
The fact that I did the same thing you did when trying to evolve applin into dipplin is so funny
All my quickball captures even in the start weren’t critical captures
Vulpix is a mythical fox not a dog. Foxes are neither dogs or cats
Will team sky go to Kitakami
U need a syrup apple
Bro was in lag-tree thicket too?
I’m pretty sure gliscor is in the dlc, saw Gligar in the trailer so…
I got a turtwig in my egg
Just started playing and caught a shiny poochyena as i was walking up to Mossui Town. I have nicknamed him AirBud in Team Sky's honor.
polchagist i so small i had to squint to see it
Bruh you spoiled the shiny in the thumbnail :/
is it just me or is the caretaker russian with that accent
13:08 if you use a less efective move she insults you
Michael was like the Sheldon meme of I do not need sleep, I need answers but more like:   "I do not need story, I need Syrupy Apples" Someone make that a meme for PMR.
I love the little Easter egg they give us. You see there’s a theory that Kitakami is actually Sinjo and that’s why there’s so many Pokémon in the Teal Mask that are from both Johto and Sinnoh/Hisui, and that’s also why the egg Jacq gives us hatches into one of Sinnoh starters.
Ahh yes a new unhinged nemona
Chimchar is my favorite Pokémon! Has it really been Chimchar for everyone?
My first ever shinies in Kitakami where Houndour and Stantler
John when he uses both polarity and swinub:
They didn’t fix it. The Crit capture shake on Quick Balls was only necessary on Pokémon you already own. Since you don’t own any of these Pokémon, you don’t need the Crit capture.
Mikeys "scottish" accent sounds more Norwegian tbh 😂
ITS OUT!!!
I can confirm, it's not Chimchar for everyone, I got Turtwig and Torterra is my favorite pokemon of all time so I'm happy and can confirm it's not just the fire monke.
I lost to the first kieran as well
Love the infinity war references this is why he’s the best poke tuber
Siuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
With Blueberry Academy being in Unova, my hopes are higher than ever that we’ll get something new about gen 5 remakes at the next Nintendo Direct
24:00 just...an unadulterated ass-whooping by a Yanma, never would've thunk it
PM7 god Turtwig not sure but i suspect it contains one of the Sinnoh starters at random
Team sky mikey should definately do this dlc
Do you plan to use vikavolt?
I thought that was a shiny
41:38 I got piplup from my egg, so i guess its random 🤷‍♂
Yay, now Mikey can have a Flying Mightyena!!!  Additionally, I suspect that the Egg Pokemon you get is related to your Paldean Starter.   Similar to how in Fire Red/Leaf Green the "Legendary Beast" Roaming is related to your starter.  Bulbasaur=Entei Charmander=Suicune Squirtle=Raikou
Mikey, the crit capture shake thing only applies to pokemon you have registered already  It's always been like that
Gen 5 remakes confirmed!!
Bro a was literally going to go get the syrupy apple and right as I got there, Mikey spoiled shiny dipplin
My subtitles said ‘Goo ratings Boogie fans’
The quick ball worked because without it having the Pokémon in your Pokédex it can catch without the crit catch
Gameplay starts at 26:55
Now pouchiana can now be with team sky
for dipplin i was just wandering away from the quests and found a little shack with a little apple orchard and there it was, a vending machine.
My friend already got a shiny johto wooper just before our school bell rang.
The level jumps for trainer battles is so weird lol
i literally got a shiny seedot and growlithe doing the main dlc storyline subbing to pm7 does bring you luck after all
I think ribombee evolves becaue there's a space between it and pikachu in the pokedex
so zebstrika is still stuck in unova
Don't go to easy on the AI. Kieran and carmine will mess you up. They are EV trained
13:16 No. Vulpix is a fox.
BLUEBERRY IS IN UNOVA!! HECK YES!
Take a lesson here at 23:55. Your need to have your Pokemon set at level 90 or above. These Pokemon are not weak. They are high level.
I like the color teal
I went into the DLC with just my starter, so that I could use a new team but still have an ace to pull out if things got dicey at the start. And things got dicey real fast 🤣  Nice to see that they give Kieran an actual win if you lose to him.
We got the starters i think based on the paldean starters. I chose sprigatito and got turtwig. So im guessing this save you have started with fuecoco since you got chimchar
Mossfell Confluence, look for a apple orchard on the other side of the river from the main town, there's an apple stand that sells it for 500
YT CC: “go ratings boogie fans!”
7:47 “Johtoan.” Some of the official adjectival forms of regions are dumb
Mine was a piplup!
nice
7:07 you gotta win a lottery, actually
6:27 no it’s not. Terápagos has pentagons. The Pokémon has hexagons.
40:22 That's interesting, because when my egg hatched, I got a Turtwig instead!
i got turtwig from the egg that jacq gives you
Hi, I’m looking for a HA Tatsugiri Curly Form if anyone has one for trade that would be awesome,really want one too use on my teal mask team Thanks
I read somewhere that we should take lv60ish with us since that was about the level scaling my new team was ceruledge, slither wing, kilowattrel, tinkaton, dipplin and mamoswine
Finally the dlc is here!I want a shiny diplin
I can tell by the thumbnail that this is gonna be a great first episode
If you have a *New* Pokémon you don’t crit capture
See kids, that’s why you shouldn’t replace your op level 100 Pokemon with level 50 unevolved bug types. Also, you should name the Infernape Ludicrous as a nod to your first nuzlocke!
BOY’S TEAM SKY HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH A POOCHYENA!
You can get Dipplin early. Just explore, it's something you find.
WE CAN FINALLY HAVE FLYING MIGHTYENA!
John 14:6"Jesus answered, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, no one goes to the Father except through me"
✝️WAIT STOP✝️it’s not to late to turn to God❤️Jesus died for us but the devil did nothing for us❤️God bless u all
FINNALY new play thru
I started this DLC with a lvl 55 shiny Jumpluff  😭 it was quite difficult. At least I had sleep powder infiltrator jumpluff but still.
yo watching now
did u know that dipplins signature move actually changes if u use the shiny
Not 5 Minutes into the DLC I caught a Shiny Poochyena. That was a good day.
14:37 that's more of a Russian accent
Vulpix is not a dog. it is a fox
that accent is closer to Russian than Scottish XD!!
GO TEAM SKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i think its level scaled
i purposely competitively built my shiny mareep to kill the terapagos after learning about its rock weakness. cant wait for blood on the little bois hands.
Briar is giving me an android vibe
18:26 there is now Gender neutral restroom now
So my only Pokemon going into kitakami was a lvl 50 shiny applin but cuz it has no moves i lost against carmine and her brother in the first 2 battles
How the hell did you edit this video so quickly
Yeah well...I'm pretty sure that I didn't saw those two or the teacher  around in Blueberry Academy, also I am 90% chance that the Academy is also in Paldea sooo...am I from an alternate world? Like in Back to the Future? 🤔😰  The remaining 10% is that the teacher got fired or retired, and those two kids got expelled:  one due to his votes (he is a shy boi and is terrible at speaking with people=interrogation anxiety),  the other because she has combat spirit...and caused trouble because of that🫤  The second option makes much more sense, but be what someone from Team NightSky said (not sure if you encountered the...beware), I am afraid of consequences because of those actions...😰
Drippplinnnn
I got a Turtwig from Jacq’s egg. I think it’s random for everyone.
it seems the Egg is the Sinnoh starter weak to your Paldean starter. mine was Turtwig because I chose Fuecoco
I miss my switch that my ableist father withholds from me. I can’t avoid spoilers forever.
on the bottom right corner of the map you can also find the item to.evolve it
Silly Mickey, calling it blubbery, CLEARLY it’s blueberry. Don’t worry Mickey, we forgive you! 😊
Dipplins basestats are: KP:80 Atk:80 Def:110 (EV +2) Sp-Atk:95 Sp-Def:80 Ini:40
you should call it Ludacris after the chitchat in your very first nuzlocke
What was that accent part Russian Irish and scottish...lol
Terastal Pokémon….ears?🤨
Blubbery academy
Hay pls get kommo-o
I got a turtwig from my egg 😂
It would be good if team sky camw to this region because he could get a yawnmega
pokemon
I love the Scottish-Russian Caretaker
Dragonite: flies as fast as a plane Jessie: stops him with a frying pan
Im going to head over to 🎶  Peachy's, Peachy's, Peachy's Peachy's Peachy's, to buy Po-ké Baaaaaalls 🎶
The crit capture shake is coded to always play if catching a Pokemon you've already caught, that isn't a bug.
2 thing's, us Scott's dont have that strong of an acsent, also THAT IS A RUSSIAN ACSENT NOT A SCOTTISH!!!!!
Well, now I have to find Jaque I wasn't expecting a starter to come out of that egg
I've been playing this DLC since earlier today, and it's been fun, but as I was exploring I stumbled upon a place called Wisteria Pond where tons of Orichorio Sensu Style hung out, and as I passed a group of them, I found a shiny. My first ever in Kitakami. And not only that, later on, I found a shiny Yanma. This place has been treating me well so far :D
You should name your Infernape Ludachris. That nuzlocke was really sad to see your starter die. Now, it's returned to your team to help you through your journey
I didn’t catch that Blueberry was in Unova. Interesting…
Chimchar i love chimchar
Yeah Mikey, turns out the Egg Jacq gives you in the Teal Mask contains a random Sinnoh Starter. And yes, I do mean random, it is not determined by your starter.
Love it❤❤❤
The caretaker sounds an awful lot like Gru at some points... I love it.
I can’t beleive how bad this DLC is, like really Gamefreak?
15:15 Editing mistake, I assume?
Fun fact fighting is good against dark because it is known as a superhero and there’s a villain
I  have a shiny applin, and I named her  Dani
My mystery egg was a Turtwig! so i think they are randomized! congrats on your chimchar!
Who else got harissfeild (yokai watch) vibes from the rice feilds outside of mosui town
this...is a bucket
I honestly thought diplin was a convergence evolution and not an evolution but boy was I wrong
No way Mikey got a shiny before John
You mentioned Irish and Scottish, but the voice you gave the Caretaker sounds more like a Russian accent to me.
It's pretty crazy how Infinity War came out 5 years ago and so many people still can't hear "I don't feel so good" without thinking of Peter. Me included
Bro got a free Infernape. Name it Dixie Kong since it's a girl
I got into the first area and immediately found a shiny poocheyna
SPINARAK BACK BABY WHOOOOO
Whats up with the people wearing gold in town? I swear they told me to meet them at the waterfall back in Paldea but I can't find them.
42:54 That lady with hisuian growlithe has quest for you Don't forget to pick it up
The Scottish turned to Russian
do a stream
I wanna watch this but i don't want spoilers 😕
Team sky can now use a mighteyena
I already played some of this I’ve watched another person’s video aswell
I caught a Mightyena and put tera flying type and named Go Team Sky😂😂
Blud went to America for a field trip💀💀
That egg contains one random sinnoh starter mine turned out to be piplup and that was the event that changed my team up at the last second
You evolve it by going to the apple shack in mossfell Confluence 🍎
He can have Tera flying mightiana now
I need to go back and find Jacq!
I got the game and instantly got a shiny yanma
lets goooo
When you think of it anyone who won’t or can’t buy the dlc hasn’t been chosen to go on the fieldtrip. So the trip still happens but you won’t have protagonist luck. This just made my brain explode.
Look, I like you, I'll watch and probably enjoy this video later, please for the love of GOD don't put spoilers in thumbnails. You spoiled nothing for me but people who don't yet have the money or time are gonna unsub from you if they can't trust you not to outright spoil any surprises in new content.
I honestly love the dlc so much! I should've done the same woth my team I went in a blew through it all. Thought didn't even cross my mind
Is this for violet
I was already considering getting Shiny Dipplin for this amd seeing this thumbnail made me want it more. It only took two sandwiches to find a shiny Applin. Now i hav ethe whole family shiny!
The caretaker went from Scottish to Dracula in record time lol
😂😂 Scottish/Irish accent....with a whole load of hidden Russian.
I like the dlc so far I wish I could have played it. I watched Herovoltsy play it. Also I love your shiny Dipplin.
Caretaker sound like gru.😂
He will regret after doing all that hardwork for dipplin...  It's stats are horrendous 😂
Bruh I found a shiny geodude and shiny aipom before even getting the third sign and I have no idea how
Also, you can transfer all sinnoh mythicals/starters to S/V
I was trying to play the DLC but it wouldn't work even though I bought the DLC
how could i i dont have notifications
43:45 the jojo crew like halfway through the episode(pretty sure, not absolutely)
They added whistling let’s gooooooo
I just realized gigantamax flappletun looks like dipplin Coincidence? I THINK NOT
Did they ever fix the save glitch?
40:23  so fun fact apparently everyone gets a different pokemon from the eggs cause I got a poplio😂
The egg depends on who you started with :)
wait what- WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN
Name infernape stone cold because he stunned you.
Mikeys accent honest sounds more Russian than Scottish ahaha
I went after my new planned team immediately after carmine’s first battle and all but two (technically three) ended up being changed due to certain circumstances
dipplins base stat total is 485
The egg Jacq gives you hatches into one of the 3 Sinnoh starters, so you had a 1/3 chance for Chimchar. I got a Turtwig.
So, we're not gonna mention Mikey blew by a HISUIAN growlithe in a modern era game with barely a thought? No? Fuck that, i stared at Perrin for a solid 10 seconds wondering HOW?!?!
I would personally name the Infernape "Sun Wukong" named after the Chinese myth of the monkey king
I have a hidden ability chimchar I’m thinking about using
Once you get the full Pokedex here you can get a special reward/quest in starting area from a lady with hisuian growthlit
I got a shiny in the first 10 minutes of playing the dlc
Wait it came out?!
Jacq give you Pokémon weak to your starter in the egg If you pick spigatitto you get piplup If you pick fuecoco you get turtig If you pick quaxly you get chimchar
He should have waited to do the team sky play through now
Other than my meowscarada I caught a new team as well and there was one unseen event that immediately changed my team and mad it so that I have a full team of six including grass, fire, water, rock flying and fighting with no filler Pokémon
Petition for a team sky dlc playthrough as poochyanais in the game. Raise your hand if you agree ✋️
I spend an hour during the night the dlc came out shiny hunting applin and got one 3 mins before my sandwich ran out and now I know how to evolve it
Please use sewaddle on your final team
In Southeast kitakami there is a stand where you can buy syrupy apples for 500
I got a Turtwig from my egg, so no, not everbody gets Chimchar
The egg is one of the Sinnoh starters chosen randomly. It won't always be Chimchar.
I just finished the teal mask story and I won’t spoil anything unlike I almost just did until I skipped ahead to see how much you progressed
I saw that Unova line and I froze for like a solid 10 seconds thinking of when Unova remakes will come out 😅
28:01 this is actually a common misconception! snake jaws aren't attached in the first place, their lower jaws are two separate entities that move independently of one another, controlled by muscle! that's how they swallow such large prey.
the egg is a random sinnoh starter. I saw it be turtwig for Vasko gaming, and in his own chat for the stream said they got a piplup and another confirmed it was random
Anyone else think Pokémon’s characters are getting even hotter or just me
I'm in class and watching this
I really wish the backstory for the mythicals was stretched out over the course of the dlc and not told to you like 30 minutes in if you just book it
I got Piplup from that egg.
After this play thru will u do a team sky again
Idk how your game looks so good. Mine still had lighting, framerate, and graphical issues. 😅
Am I the only one that REALLY dislikes Carmine? (To be fair, I’ve only seen her be rude to the player and her brother).
I haven’t checked if someone’s said this but I’m guessing you get a different Sinnoh starter from the egg, I got turtwig although I’m not sure
I snapped when Mikey said that and it went to an ad
Why is it not out for me yet😭
Ya know… his Scottish accent reminds me a lot of Gobber from HTTYD
In order to evolve Applin into Dipplin, you're going to need the Syrupy Apple. You can find them at the Syrupy Shack. The Syrupy Apple is a new item introduced in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet the Teal Mask. Much like the other two apple items that can evolve Applin, The Syrupy Apple is needed in order to get Dipplin. (I copied from google)
Does anyone else hear Drac  from Hotel Transylvania when micheal is saying the caretakers lines? lol
Looks like the egg can be any of the  sinnoh starters
ITS HERE??? i thought it was releasing later this month
Was that a shiny at 40:06?!
As a true scot I give 10 out of 10
Go to the right of the community center that you lost two pokemon at. Keep going right and you will find a small shed and a small tree patch. There is a guy who will sell you syrup apples for 500
The new ursaluna look so good
Mikey looses one battle: instantly maxes out his power available 😂  I never realized he really meant he hates loosing lol
I see a JMC Giveaway live stream happening in the near future!
You can actually get the sinnoh starters by transfering them from home, along with darkrai shaymin manaphy and phione.
What did everyone get for their Sinnoh starter? I got Turtwig!
At this point, Mike just gave the Caretaker of the Community Center a voice that sounds like Scrooge McDuck! XD Also, I THINK they pulled a Kalos Region Starters Part Deux on us! We got one Starter in the Paldea region with one type, and Jaq gave us an egg, containing the Sinnoh Starter with the type that's weaker than our first type! I chose Sprigattito and got a Piplup after hatching the egg! And Mike's got a Quaxly, while his Sinnoh Starter he hatched is a Chimchar!
Apparently the starter egg is random with which Shinnoh starter you get.
DARK
Female Chimchar? That’s so lucky. Unfortunately her Nature doesn’t seem to be great. Neutral or Adamant would be best.
About the egg that Jacq gives. It seems that it gives you a random Sinnoh starter because I got a Piplup from it
Just realised how perfect this is for team sky, I hope we see a team sky series on this soon
Literally the first Pokémon I encountered in the DLC was a shiny yanma
My egg was Piplup!
Vulpix is a fox.
Blubbery
Love you content keep this up❤
I swear if I see the words “Dipplin is Drippin’” I might just force a stick down someone’s throat
he needs to look at empoleon hidden ability since its changed
Cannot help feeling you should use some Paradoxes to show Briar, even if the NPC is not programmed to react to one.
Hyped for part II
sun won kong
I think dipplin should have been grass fairy because it’s based off of a candy apple and usually candy is associated with the fairy typing
Anyone else sleep in, forget to update the game for the DLC and is now watching this while their game is updating? Anyone? Just me? 😂
The best thing. . . THERE IS LEVEL SCALING depending on whether or not you finished the mainline story. No lie on my second playthrough of this dlc I hadn't gotten to the E4 yet and the levels are like 12 at the bus stop and the highest level I've seen of roaming Pokemon is 55. and the static tera Pokemon apply to this as well
Mikey... you made the caretaker sound Russian.... I LOVE IT!
They put scald back Michael
Im gonna come back after ive played it for myself byee
It’s my birthday 🎉🎉🎉
Good to see the long version of these videos
I love how shiny Dipplin is a caramel apple! Its my personal favorite between  the candy and caramel apples.
7:44 so the brown ones arnt “regular” 🤨📸
Mikey's accent for the community center guy sounds like if Doofenshmirtz was Russian.
Finished the game today myself. It wasn't bad. Now i get to watch everyone else play it.
Just the casual Lagtree Thicket
This mannis cringey as hell...Glad u support baf games. Congrats
My egg from teacher had turtwig
Mikey forgot you can do the dlc before beating the game
I feel like there would be a Team Sky adventure in this land all so that our Glorious Leader can be reunited with Air Bud who can finally become a Flying type.
4:39 I mean Jacq made the pokèdex thats used through all of Paldea, so I’m sure his name carries SOME weight
From what I've heard, the Egg can be either of the Sinnoh Region's Starters. So it could've been Turtwig :)
omg😂😂😂😂 move over david attenborough
Name a purple Pokemon. Purplecliffe : 34:13
The care taker isn’t really Scottish I think. Maybe Russian🇷🇺
Don't think anyone has noticed this,but If you pay close attention to Briar's eyes,the red highlight surrounding her pupil disappear sometimes. This makes her look even more *sus* . Could be a glitch,but i doubt it,since it happened with every YouTuber i've watched play through the beginning of the DLC.  If i had a nickel for every YouTuber i've watched where Briar's eyes were off,i'd have two nickels,which isn't much but it's weird it happened twice.  Also,at 25:19,i like to think that Kieran is all shy everytime but when it comes to reading the story out loud he turns into a jojo part 3 character
I finished the dlc story and it was cool and I liked the siblings! Now I have to wait to shiny hunt with my bestie!  Not to mention my friend and I both got Shinys in the first 5 minutes of playing the DLC! I got a Shiny Yanma and she got a Shiny Sewaddle!
It only auto does the crit capture if you catch the Pokémon before
Mikey:apple = orchard Nintendo:apple = vending machine
I opened the game for the first time in weeks and the first thing i see after Jacq's call is a shiny cufant-
I'm glad you're playing "costs as much as a pokemon game".  Means I'll know exactly if its worth it or not
I love watching this and realizing that the egg gives you a different sinnoh starter egg. I thought it was guaranteed piplup
30:48 as soon as he said sandwich 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i wish i could get the dlc...  😢
Within the first 10-15 minutes I found the area where you buy the syrupy apples and almost immediately found a full-odds shiny Applin! It’s been the star of my Kitakami team!
Only use normal pokeballs always work in teraraids
How did everyone know what shiny Dipplin would look like? Had I known I would've spent some time catching a shiny little apple dragon too
Maybe Team Sky explores Kitakami if not Unova next? He'll be happy to see more flying types and Mightyena
Hi Michael will you be completing the pokedex on camera
Ironic that you have a shiny Applin when a few days ago, John failed to find one. That's the punishment he gets for finding the shinies in the JMC.
The no crit capture = no catch only applies to pokemon you've already caught/registered in the dex. The first time you catch a Pokémon, not getting a crit capture doesn't automatically mean you failed the catch.
I love that the dex is so much easier to fill out since it adds in the entries from the main dex
The crit capture only is for Pokémon you’ve already caught.
What’s the item your Koraidon has? I don’t recognize it.
Team sky is gonna have a field day with car m ine
I forgot the Gangar is shorter then a human adult male
3:46 DOES THIS MEAN UNOVA REMAKE?!?!
I literally did the exact same thing as you did
This is amazing
Name infernape "Monke" PLEASE
Why am I in a Pokémon game (Kieran)
From Scottish to Russian lol
I love how Mikey beat John to a shiny
As far as I’m aware, Part 1 can be done at any point once you start the Treasure Hung while Part 2 is truly post-game.
U should use leavanny or yanmega on your team please
Lag tree thicket is crazy
This is so awesome I’m so sad I can’t the dlc
I was trying to stay in the dark but as soon as I open YouTube I get spoiled on shiny Dipplin 😅
14:03 I'm Scottish and am completely offended and laughing at the same time
as someone who is part Scottish, that Scottish impression is so inaccurate to the point where it is funny. Nice try though Michael!
I had the exact same team for the first fight against Kieran but I didn't even change the moves. I lost.. i got swept but it doesn't change the story. That kid still thinks we're awesome.
Was running around, looking for Ekans (Arbok is my fav Poison type), and found a Shiny Nuzleaf. Woot, day 1 Shiny, just like with Scarlet! (Nacli)
The Russian😂
Im so confused about the Egg, because I got Turtwig from mine so I thought "oh, its the sinnoh starter with the same type as your paldean one, like the isle of armour" but Mikey picked Quaxly and got Chimchar, so now im like "HEH????"
The critical capture thing was never a glitch – it is to save time, once a Pokémon is registered to your Pokédex. It will always show a quick catch up whenever you catch a new one.
Do a play through of tears of the kingdom
I wonder if we will get a team sky run of the DLC And he can be forced to use the Pokemon from the DLC as a joke
Just imagine a guy on a dinosaur sceaming "where is the vending machine I WILL GO THROUGH THEIR YARD AND TRESSPASS"
9:16 I think Mikey forgot in this moment that if your first time catch it won't do the critical shake for the catch.
Mikey, once you have the style card you can get a nice new bag with your channel colors in the bag store in cascarrafa!! Just thaught i’d mention it😊😊
Russian caretaker russian caretaker
When I get home, I am going to search to get a ludicolo, definitely spelled that wrong, I like never got to use them before even though I love their design and typing
Mikey your Scottish accent sounds Russian
Yes
What? I've never had that pokeball bug happen... I've had fails, crits, and just normal catches. Had the game since day one and I have had no where near the problems everyone else has lol. Worst I've had is stuck in the falling animation or koraidon just went invisible
Weird, the egg Jacq gave me ended up being Piplup. Don't get me wrong, Piplup best Sinnoh starter imo, but is the Sinnoh starter egg go off by the Paldean starter you chose, or is it random?
im working on a team sky vid for the dlc
I played all day. I got the Kitakami Pokedex filled and am through with the story. I got a shiny Spinarak right at the start :)
well I did use an infernape while battling him so it was easy
HOW DID I MISS THIS NOOO I WAS EATING
Seems everyone gets different sinnoh starter eggs cause I got piplup!
*Jaiden Animation Vietnam Flashback*   "ITS KNOWS GIGA DRAIN??!"
Yooo Mikey my egg was a turtwig
I am getting a feeling that Carmine will act as a tsundere for the male protoganist xD, probably not gonna happen though
Carmine irritated me with how mad she got for no reason. My 1st random wild shiny in the dlc was an hour into playing & it was a shiny houndour!!! 💙 I just realized he spots Perrin's Hisuian Growlithe while running around trying to evolve applin but he doesn't see Perrin! 😂
I was right! Kinda. I had a theory that the blueberry academy was in a region inspired by northeastern north America more specifically quebec. It was in Unova which is based on New York but upstate new York borders quebec.  If you would like to know more I could provide a link to a reddit post I made about it.
Scrussivanian is the accent 😂
So the egg Jacq gives you is random… cuz mine hatched into Turtwig
The crit capture is for already catch Pokémon.
I ate soup while watching this
You sound like a Russian person taking over the caretaker
If Nemona is Goku, Carmine is Vegeta.
The crit capture animation isn't a bug but intentional, if you have a mon registered in your dex, all successful captures display as crit, it's a way to save time
Her name is pronounced how it’s spelled- car-mine. It’s a crimson color, like Briar’s pants or your shirt lol I also caught a shiny Applin last night so I can have a shiny Dipplin. And I was walking around for like 10 minutes, about to catch a Yanma when I found a shiny one in the background. Hopefully a good sign going forward for shinies I didn’t know Jacq was there and gives an egg??? And the fact that Mikey got a female one is crazy Did he just…casually walk by Adaman’s descendant and was like “ooo a Hisuian Growlithe!” Like ???? 😂
lets go i got that dlc living dex
1 hour    Best YouTuber evr❤❤❤
So yea there's level scaling in this. Its based on your badge count AND I'M SO HAPPY
Yes! Been waiting for this❤
Airbud is possible...   *team sky has a returning member...*
god i can’t wait to get home from work today and play further through i only got like an hour to play last nighttt
Love the new dlc
Petition for Mickey to do a legends of Zelda tears of the kingdom play through
The sinnoh starter egg can be different. Mine had a Piplup.
Yeah i got a chimchar
I got a Turtwig.
Wait i got piplup from the egg, is that a violet thing or is it random?
Can't wait to play this on Friday I'll watch this part and then check out for not too many spoilers.
my strategy for making this dificult. use only unevolved pokemon. (untill you run out of pokemon that you need to evolve for the dex.) i lost both battles. i had three pokemon. for once these are not roadblocks. if it wasnt for the fact that most people wpuld not loose these battles then loosing them should have a greater impact.
useful tip if you select learn tm on the Pokemon summery screen it shows only the tms it can learn.
The Ogre Oustin minigame could be done for John Michael Cup season 3
Blueberry Academy is in Unova  Enamorus was added to the Djinn trio  Legends Arceus brought in Ingo  BDSP were the most recent remakes   I CALL THAT A UNOVA LEGENDS GAME WILL HAPPEN!!!!!
I genuinely forgot this was coming out today!
They missed the chance to put the blueberry school in kalos
Pokémon that were in the base game shouldn’t be in the dlc dex. 35 dollars for 15fps and 6 new Pokémon aren’t worth it.
Try to catching a shiny gligar-Gliscor
Its not Chimchar for everyone I got Piplup
Yay so excited!!!
What are everyone's thoughts on the long trip you had to take?  Because if you really think about it if you look at both Maps the place you go is in the top right if you line the maps correctly
Miltank sucks if you agree       👇
Ogerpon is smol and goes Bonk  Spoilers below!       She's adorable!
Hellll yeah 👍👍👍
How did Mikey make the old guy  simultaneously Russian and scottish
no its always random: it can be turtwig, chimchar or piplup
I don’t have the DLC yet. My parents and I are flying down to Colorado on September 22nd to visit my sister and celebrate her 30th birthday which is on September 23rd. We’ve been trying to save up money for extra things to do on the trip. Maybe I’ll be able to get it next month.
I see you did tree thing
can someone time stamp when he found the shiny
All this unova stuff is definitely foreshadowing
My game is not playable... loading times are crazy
The fact you can’t buy the dlc’s separately is so dumb
I didn’t get chimchar, I got a turtwig out of my egg.
This woman has the complete scarlet and violet book as you can see The book has both colors
You made the caretaker more russian than scottish 😂
The leaks were real......
I can already see the simps for Briar
Name the dipplin dots
Was the weather rainy for everyone who started this dlc?  Cause it was last night for me when this dropped.  So I was there when it initially dropped.
As a Scot, that accent really bugs me. Mainly because it's actually Romanian.
Ioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllllllllllllllllllllllll
What
Bro
i hunt shiny yanma
Wonder when Team Sky Mikey will land in Kitakami
Yooo dlc time baby let's go
So I don't know if you knew this, but shortly after you enter, you can find Jacq and he will give you with s Sinnoh Starter. It's level 5 btw.
You evolve Dipplin by going to the Mossfull confluence at the bottom right corner of the map. There will be a shack that sells syrup apples that will evolve applin to Dipplin
yanma
I shall watch this once I have finished the dlc on my own can't wait to watch this
Excited for this playtrough
1 hour gang
ive already got a shiney magcargo
Mikey I don’t feel so good 7:53
My switch chose the worst time to break, I dropped my switch and the sd card broke, ejected the sd card, and proceeded to delete all my games, I have no clue how to fix this or how to get the parts for it, now I have to watch everyone else have fun, while I fear that 5 years of save data are lost to time
Yay
If you could see my smile just I saw this... You would be terrified I looked like a monster
Wait its already out!?
Hold on hold on hold on! 😂 I've I ever win anything imma be like I have protagonist luck! 😂😂😂😂 I love it
I’m pretty sure that shiny dipplin has a unique color for candy syrup move.
I'm betting having Blueberry being Unova is a subtle hint that something with that region is coming soon.
rice patties she means doughnuts 👌🏿
0:16 hello? Hello hello? Uh I wanted to record a message to help you get settled in on your first night
Blubbery academy
1 hour gang    👇
Can't play so was waiting for your video ❤
It kind of makes sense for blueberry to be in unova because of iron leaves and iron crown. I think in violet the other academy must be in jhoto
I named my Corphish Corfeeish.
yeah I didn't trust her too the moment she mentioned Area Zero
Carmine is basically nemona and hop
The voice of the caretaker went from Scottish to Irish to Russian 😂
Mikey content 🎉
I love how Carmine is basically Nemona and Klara combined into one person.
NO its NOT good & I wish to die why?!? 16:26
WHY WAS THERE A MONKEY IN THE EGG???????
Blueberry Academy is in Unova?!? Black & White remakes confirmed???? (As a big fan of Unova this intrigues me)
She is no kin of mine
When the scottish/irish accent turned russian and then Scandinavian 😂
11:00 "YOU ARE AGGRESSIVE!" You should catch that Poochyena, and name it "Pizza".
I am kind of disappointed I have to buy to see the teal of mask part 1 :(
That caretaker guy sounds a little like Gru from Despicable Me
Keep up the awesome work and videos Mikey love the video
u should start calling it bluhberry now
I'm so excited these are the best other than Team  Sky! I know I'm going to 𝐞𝐧𝐣𝐨𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐞𝐧𝐣𝐨𝐲 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 videos. Bye huge fan❤❤❤💜💜🧡🧡
I like it
Hmmm I’m getting isle of armor feels I’m thinking this dlc so I’m thinking new games can come here instantly like isle of armor
I wish I could get it sooo much now 😢😢😢
So excited to see your playthrough of the Teal Mask!
I believe the pokeball crit thing is still a thing, but it only happens AFTER you register it in your Dex. So new entries can still wiggle, then they'll all be crits again
Pls do season 3 of th John Michael cup and I love your vids btw and u are amazing
Team Sky vs Team Nightsky Kitakami edition?
This was great and I hope team sky Mikey plays through it too on MandJTV Plays ❤
GODDAMNIT. I waited for this the whole day. Alas it's time to sleep and my parents would kill me if I don't
Blueberry Academy being in Unova...    Gen 5 remakes looking more likely
Love youre content but the egg is random I got turtwig
I wonder what our mother will be doing while on a trip edit "are all her Pokemon dogs" that's going to be a meme for a month or two
W VID 🔥🔥🔥
Love the video Mickey ❤️ unrelated but anyone who hasn’t heard my kind of women by mac demarco please go listen to it
I havent l played Pokémon  since platinum.... i grew up with red blue and yellow..... makes me want to buy a switch and get back into it
