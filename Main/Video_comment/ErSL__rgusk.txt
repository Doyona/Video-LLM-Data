This is literally my brain in a nutshell ❤❤ "i don't know what im doing at the mall😅"
Can we talk about how adorable Virgil is with the purple eyeshadow? Like seriously I'm obsessed I need more of it
O.g I loved that is much
I love prinxiety sooo much!!!
Hey Thomas, I know you probably wont see this but I first started watching you back in 2017 when I first found out im trans.....for almost a year ive been forcing myself to try and mask it and act cis. Today that all came crumbling and I came to rematch this video because it genuinely helped me.....thank you, for being a constant in my life that I can watch whenever I need anything. A laugh, a cry, a distraction from everything while still keeping it real.......thank you.
I don’t know why in my head this was a “sanders asides” instead of a main episode, when, although there was a relabeling of things and I can’t remember which videos were affected, the intro to this video calls it an important episode to the storyline. Edit: okay yeah it does say sanders asides in the thumbnail still so this was one of the ones that was switched
11:48 CAPTAIN BLUNDERPANTS? WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
19:57  w ship
Am I the only one who realized that Virgil made a reference from “I Miss You” by Blink-182
I can’t believe I missed that Radiohead reference for SO long 6:49 💀 Thomas you sly dog
You can’t tell me this isn’t secretly a ship video for Roman and Virgil.
Are you still planning on a live action version? :D
I am squealing and wiggling my toes right now. Oh my gods (PJO fan) this is so cute.
Bro, I don’t know if I’m crying because of Virgil and Roman or because of Thomas and Nico, point is I’m crying.
NOT GERARD GAY
AWWWW YAYYY broooo Virgil's purple eyeshadow when he's really excited is adorable!!! ASJDBWAH AND ROMAN AND VIRGE GETTING ALONG SO MUCH SDHWAHHYIIPPEEEEEE  Also I love how it's canon that Virgil makes Thomas stim!! It makes me so happy :DD  Edit: Aaaaand when Thomas' anxiety spikes, Virgil's voice doubles lmao- I just love seeing how different things change/affect Virgil :D
Yknow when I first saw the title like 4 years ago I had a deep hope this was somehow about the sides flirting with Ainxiety but this is..ok two
23:13 I saw a tumblr post about this monent where it saud that Logan wasnt even in this episode and Thomas still found a way to ignore him 😢
19:55
crazy how this episode is about janus when hes not even in it
Did he ever realse the irl version
4 years, this still hurts me, I seriously wish I had the confidence for things like this. Virgil's grip is.. a strong one lol
Oh look it’s me, crying at 2am. Great.
Am I the only one who’s curious on how Login, Paton, Janis, and Remus would look like I’m this art style?
Live action version when? 🥺
4:28 I AM LIVING FOR THIS TEAM UP 😂😂😂😂
My Prinxiety shipping heart nearly had a panic attack with how Virgil and Roman look at each other and speak to each other!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
I'D LOVE THIS LIVE!!!! IT'D BE SO COOL!!
Not only is it cute but so relatable
22:23 today I learned there’s an after credits sequence, I have never watched till the very end and I feel dumb now 😂
no bc prinxiety is coming THROUGH this ep its making me cry
notice in the end virgils eye shadow changes between purple and black when he gets excited
I can't believe this came out FOUR YEARS AGO.
I love that before we knew Nico's name the subtitles said "cute stranger"
This episode is just teaching me to put more buttons and stickers on my stuff if i want a cute gay introvert to (not) want to talk to me
It’s been 4 years since the last official SanderSides it’s just been mini episodes since. I didn’t realize it’s been this long
19:33 imagine Virgil screaming after roman "SHUT UUP!!"
I love how when Virgil is happy his eyeshadow turns a shiny purple!! 22:29
anyone else shipping roman and vergil
:)
Janus: I will admit that was adorable
I still really want that live action version 🥹
"Iohknow, plant." is singlehandedly the best Sanders Sides quote to ever be uttered.
I’ve never related to something so much… also I have really bad second hand embarrassment right now
I need more sander sides in my life
6:47  I've seen this vid so many times and only NOW am i noticing this was a radio head reference...
STOP THAT WAS SO CUTE :((( I'M GONNA CRY..
Episode: GAY PANIC!!!! Me: I LOVE IT!!!
So cute yup I’m subscribing like right now it was tooo cute ❤
the virgil x roman is strong in this one boys, side note just rewatching and still obsessed with sanders sides
whys no one talking about the blink 182 reference at 5:18
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that when Virgil got really happy and excited, it's eyeshadow was glimmery purple instead of his usual black? I love that little detail EDIT: As soon as I posted this, I found all of your comments pointing this out as well- whoops
i JUST noticed after my millionth rewatch that virgils demon voice is officially called tempest tongue, i love when creators adopt things from the fandom
8:22 communigaytion
16:09 HE FEARS THINGS TOO???????????
Im not crying you are!
The use of purple eyeshadow!!! The switching back and forth between purple and black!!!!! I love it I love it so much!!!!!!!!
Roman: “What are you doing?!”  Thomas: “...I don’t know... plant...?”   🤣
after 3 years, I’ve finally realized that Roman saying he’ll “add it to the list” is referring to when Janus said both he and Roman were familiar with mistakes, and that Roman must’ve thought about it for a while after.
TOPPA THE MORINNN TWO YA!!!!! 11:02
damn this is cute and had me dying of warmth ..... 😊❤🎉
I loves this soo much
This are making me stim uncontrollably make more.
IS THIS A TRUE STORY
20:47 WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE BOBBY WORST?!?!😂 It can’t just be me who thinks that right??
I love how dumb Roman gets when he’s in love. Man is not thinking clearly AT ALL
As a dime romantic, I have zero understanding of how someone could feel all those feelings for someone they've LITERALLY JUST LOOKED AT
Me and every other prinxiety shipper is dying rn
8:19 I love how Roman just starts shaking his head faster 😂
This is me when I get crushes in bookstores Except I never do anything successfully
YOO THERE CANNON
"join me, no thinking" LMAOOOOO
Hey, hey, guess what.  Booooooo!
I AM SCREAMING!!! THIS IS SO GOOD!
I love that Julian’s advice is realistic. You aren’t fixed but you’re on your way. Also it made me lol when Zach could only think of his fav porn star 🌟.
I was binge watching the sander sides as a new fan and i gotta admit that.... this had me screaming for hours because of he second hand embarrassment XD
my favourite thing is watching videos and finding comments i wrote when i was 15
Does animation bro have rizz???
I loved this episode so much, as a person probably with social anxiety I really felt seen!
VIRGIL JUST LOOKING AT ROMAN AND THEN PUSHING THOMAS FORWARD WAS SO CUTE!!  The stimming once he got back home the way Virgil’s eyeshadow was bright and sparkily the worries and planning dates in your head omg this pulled at my heartstrings in the best way possible I was giggling kicking my feet and stimming the whole time my little hopeless romantic heart was HURTING
Can we talk about the end with Virgil and roman? I swear I saw Virgil blushing! prinxiety anyone?
Waiting for this to be re-made in live action. PLS
I’m rewatching this like two years later and I just noticed the Radiohead reference I love that!
What’s goin on with Virgil’s eyeshadow, I love it 🥰
Virgil being in charge of Stims is so cool
I never noticed Virgils eye shadow turns purple when hes overly excited-
I love that Virgil has purpler/shinier eye bags when he's excited at the end. Might be a trick of the light, but if so it's really cool.
Heehee 💘
It's been 3 years Sanders! Where is the live action version! (This is a comment for comedy, a commet-dy if you will, I know that he has been very busy and people might not have wanted a live action version)
AHHHH PRINXIETY‼️‼️
6:50 Mr sanders….. was this….. a radiohead reference !!!?!?
Ive just realised ABDIllustrates a favorite artist and a favorite comedian technically collabed....Im now happy
virgils eyeshadow being purple when he was excited
I'm rewatching all of the sanders sides content, and OMG. VIRGILS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY N HELPING THOMAS????
They way Roman said “shut up emo” 😭 I thought they were gonna kiss or something
Thomas and Nico are so cute!
10:44  Roman: *what* are you doing??! Thomas: i dunno, plaent? -_-''
23:41 man the more and more I binge and watch the more I feel seen middle school me really had taste XD
This is basically just a meal for the prinxiety shippers... i love it
The purple eyeshadow tho :O
the ending of this is definitely my favorite sanders sides scene like  EVER
I LOVE VIRGIL SO MUCH HES THE CUTEST THING EVER!! ❤❤❤❤
I have never been this happy from an animation. LOVE IT.
Ahhh! Seeing this after watching the recent gift giving video! How cute!
Okay I just have to take the time to comment on how Virgil at the end when he’s excited is so accurate to how anxiety can portray itself in positive scenarios. I have a lot of anxiety, and this past year have been exposed to other ways that anxiety shows itself in day-to-day life, not just in extremely unhappy or negatively stressful situations. There are many relatively positive situations where anxiety is still at the forefront, often coming out as lots of extra movement or shaky hands or pacing or smiling and laughing excessively, which isn’t necessarily a negative experience but is still stemming from my anxiety. I just really love how Virgil, with the purple eyeshadow (which is an amazing touch that gives us some extra worldbuilding(?) about how emotions can affect how some sides express themselves) is showcasing those other ways that anxiety affects us. Lots of love for Thomas and the team for being so thoughtful in all of their work on Sanders Sides, and I’m sooo excited for the future (:
7:58 “Erm, actually-“ 🤓
14:34 hes so sad D:
This is my first time seeing these but this is hilarious and amazing 5 stars :D
"Emphasis on the old-"
this made me scream and cry literally fighting demons rn omg this is so perfect i am a different
Not Roman and Virgil fanboying together, that’s so adorable!!
I'm genuinely kinda confused. Why is Roman part of this one? Is it because of Thomas's feelings. I thought that Patton would. Sorry idk. If I'm being honest, Roman is kinda acting like Virgil as well
6:30 Anyone else notice they have three microphones like the ones they’re holding the ones that as on their headphones and the one in the middle-
THIS WAS SSOOOOOOOO CUUUUTTEEEEEEE  I might use this theme for later ideas on stories I make! Thank you!!!
11:14 Why does that sound like BBH???
Gerard gay lmao
That was so cute
6:00 Virgil's button system is so cute to me idk why lol
15:39 i love how this applies to both janus and nico!
Does this mean Thomas has a boyfriend 🥹
his eye shadow is changing.
"you're a creep, you're a weirdo, what the hell are we doing here?" how am i just getting into sanders sides today
I love Virgil just going “OH YOU’RE RIGHT!” after Roman corrects him about stalking, favorite joke in the episode
this episode means the world to me and I think about it all of the time
What I love about the end card to the video was how Virgil's eyeshadow changes from purple to black depending on how he's feeling at the moment as I think it's a cute trick, it must have taken a few takes to switch between purple eyeshadow to film those scenes and then scenes with black eyeshadow.  I would love to see a live action recreation of these video as that would be awesome especially seeing the bloopers
Roman, with all due respect, there's a reason Pinterest is a thing.
This was the first Sanders Sides I’ve ever watched. Very confusing, I had no idea what the concept was.  And now I’m hooked. Watching the whole playlist rn.
Take notes, Miraculous Ladybug. This is how you write an adorable romance between a clumsy overthinker and a friendly pretty boy.
VIRGIL HAPPY   VIRGIL IS LAUGHING AND IS HAPPY AND IS STIMMING AAAAAAAAAAA
forever my favorite sander asides video
Now I wanna know if they're working on a real life version.
Adorable!
I love it! The animation and story is so good! I can very much relate to the anxiety of Virgil and wishful thinking of Roman
8:09 I like how Virgil prefers nonverbal communication because in moving on that's what him and Logan do
When this video first came out and i watched it for the first time, I think I was way too young and way too in denial about who I was to understand that feeling of really liking someone but being way too anxious and socially awkward to tell them, but since then, I’ve grown a lot and as of April this year, I’m now in my first relationship with my former best friend of like 3 years (former cuz she’s now more than a friend lol), and while the circumstances are very different lol, anxiety being that final push that makes you tell your crush that you like them is so freaking accurate, at least for my case lol, because you’re scared that you won’t get that chance again, and I guess I just wanted to say that I really appreciate this video for representing that so well c:
22:25 screaming at the purple eyeshadow again 💜 😭
9:02 looks like Goob from Meet the robinsons! LMAO
17:09 THE WAY VIRGIL LOOKS AT ROMAN LIKE I MIGHT START SHIPPING THEM NOW THEY ARE SO FRICKING CUTE!!!!!!
16:56 Leaving this here for myself :)
This is my favourite Sander Sides episode. It’s the very first one I watched (having been directed to it from an ABDillustrates video), and since then I keep coming back to it. It’s just so quotable and I find myself smiling thought the whole thing every time. It’s been well over a year since I first saw this video and was introduced to Sander sides and the fandom, as well as Thomas and all the wonderful content he makes. The fact that this video was made with the help of that fandom makes it even more special. (And Thomas I realise that you’ll probably never see this and that you probably get comments like this every day but your content means so much to me; all it takes is watching one of your videos to make my day better. Please keep doing your thing and making people smile)
Virgil making Thomas shake his hands is such a mood
About the movie theater chapter, you should’ve seen the Barbie movie! I’ve seen it. It was awesome!
19:40 BAKLAAAAA!!!! HALAAA OMG 🤧🤧❤️❤️❤️
I would do anything to see this acted out, my heart is in shambles 😭💗
Virgil really said “go, be gay”
The fact that Virgil pushed Thomas towards his crush was the best proof of the fact that Virgil is definitely shy as well as he cares a lot and is definitely the definition of Gay panic UwU Oh, I love Virgil so much! HE’S SO CUTE LIKE THIS!! Virgil is the definition of Gay Panic and Roman is the definition of Love Struck.
“I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay…”  These gay jokes just don’t get old and they never run out when it comes to Roman 😂
The anxiety I felt from this video alone. I'M JUST A SOCIAL ANXIOUS LESBIAN, BUT I WANT A GIRLFRIEND
20:00 It Like It Is A Double Date(Nico and Thomas/Roman and Virgil) But None Of Them Are Dating(At This Point In Time) Also I Love This Scene It's Amazing(19:36 to 20:00)
(It's simply meant to be) "OH MY GOD" 😂😂😂 5:10
Its been 2yrs i dont think we'll get the live action one
❤❤
THIS IS SO SWEET? OH MY GODDD
I don't know why but for some reason when it comes to Roman and Virgil, I keep seeing references to Jack and Sally from a Nightmare Before Christmas in episodes they're the focus in and *I'm LOVING it!*
The way Virgil pushed Thomas after seeing how upset it made Roman to let the guy go, melts my heart! ^v^ Because it's true! Bravery is not having no fears at all. It's moving forward to face it despite your fears!
10:43 😂
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE END THERE THAT WHOLE BRING IT AROUND PRINXIETY MOMENT THAT WAS CUTE STOP ITT
12:48 adding this to my monolgue list lmfao
The way prinxiety looks at each other is literally adorable-- Also you can see virgil blush after roman says "bravery."
My personal theory/headcanon/thing: when virgil has a more purple eyeshadow moment its more adrenaline and black eyeshadow is anxiety. The gay panic is (from what i personally think) is the combo of roman and virgil. One brings the insane levels of gay and the other brings the insane levels of panic. When combined they form the gay panic
10:08 "I hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay" an mcr aND a theater reference? ohmygod this is my new favorite comeback I just cackled out loud holyshit lmao
7:24 YUGIOH PIN !!! a perfect opening to talk anime :D
His name is Nico. He's gay. A classic case of yellow car syndrome.
When the dog barked and anxiety yelled demon is... very very relatable. This video was adorable.
Virgil asking if using Deceit as a continuous means to an end feels like a step in the right direction, he may not like Deceit but he doesn't want Thomas to regularly lie either. Which is because of his fear of being a bad person of course, but i think also deep down he still cares for his old friend. On top of that, Thomas responding to Virgil's question with "He'd be better off without me" seems like Janus (or Remus) appearing, Janus is all about self preservation, he doesn’t want Thomas to get hurt even if it means hurting others by lying, but in that moment it seemed like he recognized that lying hurts Thomas more than he thought it did. (As for the theory of Remus appearing, a common intrusive thought many depressed people have is "soandso would be better off without me" and i think this line is Remus trying to convince Thomas that hes such a bad person that even the embodyment of lies would be better off without him.)
Theirs is so 🥺 cute I am ded!
A A A A A 19:40 GAY GAY PRINXIETY OMGGGGGGG AAAAAAAAA THEM>>>>>
im so confused... why is Remus now Janice? I thought his name was revealed in the first episode that he was introduced in.
Can you make anxiety and creativity,   tell their feelings in one video, they need to be together they're so cute please and I love your videos keep going you are so cool
"who stays alone at the mall all this time?" um excuse me virgil, but I DO
So are you dating nico
This made me happy! 😁 Happy Pride month!!
Logan: Trying to keep Thomas away from intrusive thoughts Patton: Learning about grey areas in the world Roman and Virgil: Calling Thomas out on being a liar
"I don't know p l a n t" This speaks to me on a spiritual level
Oh god this is so good I miss the fateted five they were my baby's (p′︵‵。)
i know Thomas and team are hard at work getting the huge season finale done at the moment, but i do wonder if we still may get a live action version of this someday. i really hope so, it is something my eyeballs must witness
Fun fact: I got pride pins bc of this video. It has helped me make friends when I got to college and meet people like me for the first time in my life.
Gross
As an animator, this made me smile!!! Aside (see what I did there?) from the animatic aspect, this whole episode made me so very happy!!!💖
LOVE the Disney Lego castle on table in the background ❤
Anyone notice that Virgil's eye shadow switches from purple to black in the ending?
this made my gay heart too happy help
this video is so gay and I'm living for it
That dog it’s 100% the homophobic dog ✋🏻😭
Just realized Virgil represents adrenaline in the endcard. It’s such a good detail! (Plus when Roman makes a callback to the person telling Thomas to relax) It might contribute to Virgil become a light side in the future. Hope we get to see more of him with sparkling eyeshadow! Love this series so much!! 🫶🫶
"Its like CYBER STALKING!-But in real life..-" "So..Stalking?" ..... "OH YOUR RIGHT-"
I use keychains on my backpack to talk without talking
I relate so much to this situation only not with anxiety but my autism instead. Every time I've had feelings for someone, I've always gone the long way round when trying to find out if they like women and/or are single as I get too nervous or worried to ask in case its seen as rude. This can go from small idea like looking at pins on bags like you did, to massive stupid ideas and plans which makes me look even more weirder then if I had just asked.   A perfect example of the latter was with a girl in college, who I only found out liked women and was single when I invited her over to mine and we watched 3 videos about childhood crushes so ( I kid you not) I could find out if she had any female crushes and if she liked them more then the male ones. Meaning, our first bonding interaction outside of college was literally us talking about our similar childhood crushes, all because I was too scared to just ask her if she liked woman... and even then I couldn't bring myself to ask her out till 4 weeks later 🤣😂😅.   It all worked out though somehow as she's my fiancee now, though I have no clue why 🤣😂
Virgil's purple eyeshadow turns black when he's upset or beginning to worry
Without Virgil, not only would Roman not be as strong as he is today, but he wouldn't be nearly as romantic. Without Virgil, there are no butterflies, or rush, without Virgil, there is no love, there is only kindness, and that wont get Thomas anywhere in life if he wants a long lasting relationship. Without Virgil, Roman is nothing.
THE LINE AT 5:20 VIRGIL SAYS IS 🤌🏻!!! BLINK-182 REFERENCE!!!!
The amount of times that I’ve watched this is unhealthy 😅
This kinda reminds me of the time I went to the store near my house to see a girl I liked worked that worked there but then I panicked when I realized it was weird to just go to the store and not buy anything so I just randomly grabbed a melon and bought it. I never even worked up the courage to talk to her 😭😭
11:57 the one time I tried sitting on a sink like Virgil did my butt got wet and it was embarrassing
I like in the end how Virgils eyeshadow changed depending on if he were anxious or exited.
The poor dude in the bathroom rfedwtsagyhuj Dayum. Anxiety and love is such an awkward thing.
Thomas, Virgil and Roman all screaming at the end of card like a bunch of girls at a sleepover when they find out who one of their crushes gives me life. Also Virgil's purple eyeshadow is my new favorite thing. It looks so pretty on him and it's so nice to see him happy!!
Is no one going to comment on Virgil's change in eyeshadow color from purple to black and then back to purple and back to black?! I'm not saying it's a mistake I think they did it on purpose
How many times are we going to learn about lying?
4:05 Roman with the lollipop!
3:30 Hard to relax when your creativity and anxiety are harassing you
2:51 I like Virgil glaring and holding the popcorn
19:56 my h e a r t
16:20 I've only felt this once, with a teacher from an other class, I couldn't get a full sentence and she seemed confused, and... Then I left. We spoke normally before and after this but I don't know, I just kind of liked her and didn't expect to see her that time and entered shock mode 🤷🏽‍♀️
Gay cuteness overload💖
The rizzler
10:24
22:42  - 22:46  And 23:40 - 23:43  Is nobody gonna talk about The Stimming ? Just me ? Okay-
PRINCEY USED THE GAY EYES ON VIRGIL!!
Thomas’s ELA teacher: “DID YPU JUST SAY ME AND THE TEAM?!”
Oh, nvm. Disappointed by a thumbnail once again
THEYRE CANON THEYRE CANONNNNN
ok, one: I love the animation and the plot it's amazing. two: don't know why the person who was wooed in the bathroom was touching toilet paper with their dirty hands. three: why when in and out of the bathroom was the talk too deep like the two characters have been in a relationship for over a year? again love it but am just confused.
How is it that the first time I watched this series I immediately got hooked on it. Btw this is the “first time”
This is a MASTERPICE you HAVE to make another one of these it is just BEUTIFUL
I hope he makes a live action version of this
When Thomas said," Top to the morning to ya..." he sounded like Markiplier! 😂
10:35  "if I'm making a mistake, I'll just add it to the list!" No one gonna ask why Roman has a list full of all the mistakes he's made? Like the guys putting it out there!!
This episode is so adorable I keep rewatching
THIS IS SO CUTEEEEE I CANT 😭
Sshehhdvdhebd I love queers, ahhhhh this is so cute
Watching this as an introvert with social anxiety was such a struggle. Lots of secondhand embarrassment involved.
Hello Thomas, Is it alright if I use a few peaces of this video to use as audio for a video I am making? I promise I will credit you in the description.
I love this 😫❤️
Guys it’s practically canon
"Shut up, emo" beautiful
Roman: You're going to have to speak from the heart.  Thomas: *deep sigh* Patton! We need you-!  Patton: Whatcha need kiddo?  Roman: That's- not what I meant..
*Uncontrollable gay screeching*
Excuse me how did I not know that you were gay 😭
I like how Virgil acts like the older who has seen and experienced a lot brother of Roman and Roman is the naive younger brother kinda like mikey from teenage mutant ninja turtles and sees the good in everything
17:19 Prinxeity moment!!
14:56 I always skip to after this cause the part where the stranger comes out always makes me feel awkward for Thomas therefore for me as well🤣😅
8:16 Virgil is gay yet doesn't know what gay eyes are? That's relatable 💖
This is Prinxiety video. Change my mind 😌 ✨
Adding to favorites 💖
AND YOU WILL _NOT_ TELL HIM HES A TEXTBOOK CUTIE PIE
THIS CAME OUT TWO YEARS AGO??? I REMEMBER BEING SO EXCITED OVER IT COMING OUT WTF
imagine thomas trying to film this in a real food court
Love u
I SWEAR TO GOD IF THIS ISNT A MOVIE ON NETFLIX THIS IS TOO GOOD AND REALLY CUTE 😭😭😭😭😭
So NO one is talking about how Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he gets excited?!?!
23:10 - 23:18   I just realized virgil's eyeshadow changes colours.
I like prinxity 😊 It’s cute
I just noticed there's a Blink-182 reference to the song "I Miss You" at 5:19 ☺️
My last name is Flores…
WHYY WAS THAT SOO GOOD I ALMOST CRIED!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope a side points out how his eye shadow changed whenever he's happy or excited.
Virgil's eyeshadow change is the flipping cutest thing everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
We insomnia
can someone explain what thomas was lying about?
This hits too close to home
I loved this format for sanders sides! More animatics would be awesome. As long as I hear Thomas’s voice I can imagine what facial expression the characters are making. This series could be a podcast and I’d love it the same :] But seriously this was awesome!
I like to see the real life version of this too
The amount of times stuff like this happens to me is crazy. It hella hit home seeing them tug him around like "I see a pretty but I don't want them to think I'm stupid awkward and weiiirdddd"
Even Thomas's inner self is gay
I live how so many people just ship this guy with himself
holy crap that was so sweet my heart is melting
19:28 For people that need to explode or scream.
I ship Virgil and princy
*I PROMISE I HAVEN’T WATCHED THIS 100 TIMES AND FREAKED OUT EVERY SINGLE TIME AT THE END-* *(ALSHALSJSISJSK JKJKJK <333)*
gerard gay
I love this so much omg TwT
My heart. ❤
2:24 22:20
Virgil and Roman are getting along better than they ever have before this episode, even sometimes effortlessly falling in sync.
. . . why did thomas hiding in the trash can remind me of the time my sister threw me in the trash after my mom told her to pick up the trash around the house. . .?
Bathroom guy deserves better 😂
I feel so bad for restroom guy
Awww I’m so happy for you Thomas 😊💕💕
10:59 JACKSEPTICEYEEEEEEE
This already came out 2 years ago???
GERARD GAY
I haven't seen more realetable think than this
I love this episode, I was literally dying
As a person with social anxiety and really strong second hand embarrassment, this was physically hard to watch. Great video tho!
god this is so relatable 😭
I literally had this issue yesterday.  Me: I wanna talk to her. . .  My anxiety, Luna: What will you say? You’ll make a fool out of yourself. Don’t even try.  My creativity, Sil: but what if she’s like you? You’ll make a friend!  Me: m mm . . . . . .m m m m m .. . . .  Luna: don’t.  Sil: my personal thoughts are do it so we can make a friend!  Me: :/
9:29     Heathers, anyone???             B l u e ?
Love how Virgil push Thomas
DID YOU GUYS SEE VIRGILS EYESHADOW WAS PURPLE FOR A BIT, LIKE WHEN HE WAS REALLY HAPPY?! its entirely possible that this was talked about before and im an idiot BUT STILL
Virgil = gay panic
ah yes internal conflict, i relate
BRO SINCE WHEN WAS THS 2 YEARS AGO ???? I
i remember when this came out when tf did it turn two years old
This is better than all of my bl WEBTOON stories- (no offense to the writers lol)
Lgbtq 4 life love all yall

It was so cuteeeww whyyyy Why can't I have thaattttttt
8:12 Gay eyes? *No.* *Gay Gaze / The Gay's Gaze...*
We want to see the person you fell in love with PLEASE!
"What are you doing here?!" "Idunoplant"
“you’re a creep, you’re a weirdo… what the hell are we doing here?”  I’m upset that people aren’t talking about this joke.
A year later and this is still amazing
Dog: **barks** Virgil: GAH, DEMON!
That was cute 😆
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen my heart! It’s melting!.. it’s t-to wholesome!
I love it!!!
If you know of MHA will understand... Logan: Tenya Ida Virgil: Shoto Todoroki or Earserhead Roman: Ayoma Patton: Mic or All might
I'm watching this while stuck at home with covid.
7:51 wait did i hear that right? Nico: you mind kinda telling me about them? Is he talking about roman and virgil? Can he see them? M A G I C ? ? ?
I just can't describe how many happy feelings i have i feel like i'm gonna explode
I love when Ro n V work together without fighting eachother too much ;D
Question: is the live action on Patreon yet?
this video is the definition of gay panic
Roman: “we don’t know if he’s NOT gay!” Thomas: “no. Stop. You’ve used that on me way too many times.”  I love this, because it implies that Thomas has assumed or at least hoped someone he likes is gay, when they might not be. Which is relatable. I’m honestly glad I’m not gay just because of how inconvenient it is. It’s difficult enough to find someone you like who likes you back in the same time and place, but NOW you have to find someone you like, to figure out if they are gay, be in the same time and place as them, and finesse yourself into their heart. It takes so much effort it should be an Olympic sport at this point. Hell. I would pay to see it.
I was so amazed with this beautiful thing and how accurate it was! Im not gay nor do I get many chances to go out since I cant drive myself to places but seeing the stress inducing secondhand embarrassment leading up to a satisfying conclusion really makes this masterpiece. Well done thomas you really outdone yourself again
I'm rewatching Sander sides videos and I totally forgot that Roman straight up said "what the hell was that thomas" that's the hardest I've laughed all week🤣
A lot of people find the Prinxiety ship weird because they are both Thomas but here’s why I think it makes sense: Anxiety falling in love with creativity and creativity falling in love with anxiety. Think about it. Creativity is the outlet Thomas uses to calm his anxiety. Roman can calm Virgil. Anxiety is what pushes you to be better and strive for perfection in you creativity. Virgil gives Roman purpose. Anxiety and creativity falling in love with each other makes perfect sense. I hope this makes sense to other people :)💙
Idk why but am I the only one you can se the “thing” with Roman and Virgil? a romance blossoming?
I would have a gay panic too
seeing Virgil all excited and smiling without any fear or hesitance makes me want to sOB
19:40 HERE COMES THE HERO ARC, FINALY
I loved that
Virgil having a popcorn bucket is extremely funny
This is definitely not my 8th time watching it and I’m definitely not sad it’s not going on forever <3.   They all did amazing work, especially urging such a difficult time. Love you Thomas, even though I know this is a late comment 😅.
19:03
Did Thomas ever decide to redo this video in person?
Roman:"gay eyes?"Thomas:"gay eyes."
I love the way the animation looks, oh man.. also me not being able to deal with 2nd hand embarrassment and pausing every 2 seconds during the *pushing* scene-  Edit: OH MY GOD THEIR TALKING I’M GONNA CRY.
I’m high right now and you got me crying man but this was awesome absolutely amazing work on all parts
I don't have anxiety, but the most relatable thing ever was Virgil demanding that Thomas walk around the room and shake his hands 😅Next time I'm excited I'm just gonna hear Virgil's voice in my head like "I'm gonna need you to shake your hands. You gotta do something with them, they're just hanging there."
13:56  Notice how Virgil’s reflection doesn’t really match up with his head-tilt
I want to watch this but I get too much second hand embarrassment
Episodes like these always feel like there should be more Sides present. We’re having a conflict of Thomas’ nervous habit of lying and a continuous use of the word lies, but we’re not gonna talk to Janus?
They need gay panic as one!
“no i wasn’t testing you. i was just panicking. THE UNIVERSE WAS TESTING YOU”  what an extra king 💀
"What are you doing?!" "I dunno- plant?"
Roman: shut up... Virgil: shut up...  Roman: SHUT UP!
This is just prinxity being cannon for 22 min
ll ll” you’re a creep your a weirdo what the hell are you doing here “ love the radio head reference
Comfort vid <3
please do the next episode of this
Damn relatable
Around14:45 just OMG XD
9:00
I love this video it’s so cute:)
watching this while making pins is SO FUNNY AHAHAHDHS
During that *exquisite* end portion, did anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow kept switching between black and sparkly purple? Idk what it means but I love it!!!   Also I will never stop replaying that end part (22:19 to 24:13 / end)
you were so... radiant, carefree, dreamy, Adrian, the fragrance
the prinxiety moment was Alex leaking into the video lol (and it was very cute)
I'd love to see a live-action version of this episode. Too bad I can't pledge to the Patreon 'cause I'm Argentine and I don't have dollars.
God this hits different
REWATCHING THIS I JUST NOTYICES VERGILS EYESHADOW TURNS FROM BVAL:CK TO PURPLE WHEN HES LIKE EXITED JFJIRKJH AND L:IKE OMG ISHJSJHKDXJ<BHES<HBHMB<SXSMBH<DBNMSBMNBMHESDBJKMBNSD THIS IS MY FAVORITE (mind my language) FLIPPING SHOW IVER EVER FUCKIGN WATCHED
"Huh..." "Delete it"
I finished Romans poem!  “Oh Beautius bard in the court of food You look so gorgeous  And I fell dude!” (This is prob why I’m single huh?)
sdkjhsjkghjh the happy ending- my heart-  _cries in queer_  also  _cries in hopeless romantic_  sdfhjhgkjhkfgh I lovee this episode so much!  The expressions-  the art- the emotions in the voice acting
I watch i want ABD illustrates, the person who animated this so great video
By The Hermetic Laws: “Whatever happens will be”.
what I wanna see is your doing that in real life XD
Aaaaaaaawwwww Gay love story in animation i love it 😊
On the one hand I hope we get more episodes where the Lads(tm) are following around Thomas during his every day life, but on the other hand I’m probably going to go even more crazy over the Sides interacting with each other/Thomas and trying to pick apart what it all means for c!thomas’ mental state. Sometimes I miss when I saw everyone as separate characters :,D
I’ve never seen Virgil more happy than in the end card, god it’s amazing we need more happy virgil please Thomas for the love of god
THE ADD ON THE SIDE OF THIS WAS HOW GAY ARE YOU... YAS QUEEN
Dude this is so cool, make more!!
I feel so bad for that guy in the barhroom
I just watched this for the second time. My heart hurts now(because of the ending of the story behind the animation). It was extremely adorable! And I loved it!^^
i just rewatched this are we not going talk about how virtue was blushing purple
"Shut up emo" LMAO
I need the live action one!!!
I love this ! The portrait of wanting to approach someone but freaking out and running away just to try again is so realistic!
MY HEARTTTTTTTTTT THIS WAS SO CUTEEEEEEEEE  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Anyone else notice vigils eyeshadow go from purple to grey after Thomas asked him out?
I loved Virgils purple eyeshadow i hope Thomas makes more videos with it
i haven’t heard anyone talk about “what if you’re making a mistake?” “i’ll add it to the list” OUCH especially after last episode  i also think it’s interesting that it’s only virgil and roman in this episode. last time virgil wasn’t involved at all, so roman would probably feel like he was one of the only ones who still liked roman - and didn’t choose janus over him. that is clear especially in this episode where thomas *lies* in order to avoid chasing something roman really wants. virgil asks, “will deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems”, continuing to be on roman’s ‘side’ rather than janus’. i think the choice of the word ‘deceit’ was very very deliberate

Virgil and Roman… working together?? We love to see it
hghh- iDk PlAnt… hh
16:29 'I think I *saw* a lot of wide vowels!' Welp, roman can see sounds now-
This happens to me every single day also I love this animation and its awesome
B- but princeiety
I can proudly say that I am a pintrovert, I may or may not have a bunch of Broadway, LGBTQ, and anime pins
1 year later, and now I’m watching this to hype myself up to admit I’m gay for someone
THE HEARTS WHEN ROMAN TELL V TO SHUT UP AHHHHHH
"i hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" THIS VIDEO IS KILLING ME
As soon as I saw this I knew this would be stupid and enjoyable.
im not crying your crying
His little laugh I love it
After 5 years this man is still funny...
4:14 wtf happened in the bathroom-
17:08 virgil saw how sad roman was and decided to push thomas for it, that's so sweet ahh
the art is so good!!
the end card where virgils eyeshadow went from light purple to black assault after roman said "if he's ready, you're ready" yummy anxiety kicking in again
Ah yes.....gay panic.
This art style gives me so much freaking gender euphoria TvT my little ftm heart can't take the beauty
Why is no one talking about this 10:07
gay panic! [at the disco]
I saw gay. so I said gay. it's not rude it's astute observation-
4:43 I literally have a sticker with the word gay on it from a label maker on the back of my chromebook-
I kept freaking out this entire episode, I've never seen any other and I'm very curious to see what else there is!
Awh this was so good I hope you can make it live that would be amazing! You are awesome and I hope you see this. Your vines helped me through some though time and it’s amazing to see your content grow so much! I hope you have a good day or night.
BRO THE GUY THAT THOMAS HAS A CRUSH ON HAS MY LAST NAME :O
18:38 roman screaming and crying in the background of thomas’ mins
you are very handsome
10:35 to 10:38 hit a little too close to home
Stop with the gayness Thomas for one’s
Virgil's makeup is sparkly when he's happy💜
OMG ABD ILLUSTRATES YESSSSSS
prinxiety really won with this one
OMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGG THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!
Sooooo… does this mean you have a boyfriend??
am i the only one who likes roman and virgil together .. like together together I KNOW THEYRE FEELINGS BUT THEY LOOK CUTE
I just noticed how Virgil’s eye shadow goes purple when he’s excited/happy and it goes to black when he’s anxious/annoyed. I *love* that detail
When you want to join his Patreon but you don't live in America so you literally do not have the dollars 😭😭😭😭😭😭
15:43 Janus: damn right I will
Woah! Cool detail! When Virgil is happy or excited, his eye shadow turns purple! But it’s black most of the time when he feels more self conscious or scared
Virgil is secretly a Gryffindor and I love it.
Let's have PRIDE Thomas! 🏳️‍🌈 Also, Prinxiety Bonding!!!
I relate to this so much I can’t talk to the guy I like for the life of me, also I think the sort of love hate frenemie relationship between Roman and Virgil is possibly forbidden romantic in a way call me crazy but I see it
This is more relatable than it should be
Anyone else catch the Radiohead reference?
Why does Neko sound like BadBoyHalo from DreamSMP?-
"are you ok" "yeah nothing but a bruised ego😳😊"  OMG i felt that
I HATE TO RAIN ON UR BLACK OARADE GERARD GAY
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGED
Same.
I really hope Neko is real and he is Thomas's boyfriend
Is he Gay or European??!!!     Roman: He’s Gay totally Gay
I love that its called flirt or fight because virgil in the end chose to FIGHT for the chance to take that step and even he was confused cause he normally choses flight
DAMNIT I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA GET A ROMAN X VIRGIL SCENE STUPID TOILET MAN
Where can you find the shop???
Perfume sample?  "Im not...stinky" "LIAR" that was hilarious
At the end me to Roman and Virgil: get married Roman: touches virgil’s shoulder Me: SCREAMS*
This Is My Life Everyday At My School: I’m Gay. I Go To An All Boys School. My Classmates Are Incredibly Attractive. *God Help Me.*
9:36  I just realized that this is in reference to Virgil saying “let’s put the ball in his court”
I’m still mad we didn’t get the line:  “Without doing anything to extreme… like talking” “Or murder” “What?” “I’m going to be honest I just tuned back in-“
Okay, so idl if I'm the only one that noticed but: THE BATHROOM SCENE  Roman and Virgil's reflections were so different. Roman's started out looking out, forward to Thomas maybe significying how he wants this so much for him AND for thomas  As to Virgil's reflection who started out normal, until the reflection turned its head to Thomas, WHICH MAY MEAN that he was also looking forward on the possible future; he may even be contemplating it, but then bathroom guy came out and snapped him out of it.  (I think this way because that scene felt sooo transcending, like, it's dreamy and somehow blurry? I can't think of another proper term)  IDK THAT'S JUST ME, WHATTABOUT YOU GUYS?
This video is basically just Prinxiety bullying Thomas while flirting with each other
YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THAT WAS SOOOWWWW CCEEEUUUWWWTTTT!!!!!!!
I love how Virgil’s eye shadow changes to purple when he is excited
THIS NEEDS A DISNEY SEQUEL! MICKEY MOUSE WE GOT MORe AUDITIONING FOR DISNEY PRINCES!
I love this kind of animation
I'm tearing up because of this cuteness
15:38  "Will deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems? Is that fair to him?"  Which..."him", Virge?
VIRGIL ACTUALLY BEING EXCITED *VIRGIL. ACTUALLY. BEING. EXCITED.*
I LOVE VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SO FUCKING MUCH
Why is this the cutest fucking thing? I’m way too invested in this story and I want. More. Wtf
Gay or gay
I watch it again... And I'M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE.  The best option is crying while watching your idol videos bescsue... You feel so happy. And maybe I shouldn't say that thing, but I'm so proud. I'm sorry.
THE GAY PANIC AT THE END  FELT THAT WAY TOO HARD
Thomas: Nothing but a bruised ego Roman: **grumpy faced** hmm
This was better than any show I've ever seen in my life
This is so cute 🥺
"Is he gay?"   *_"OR EUROPEAN?"_*
I cried
Bark back
This is the gayest video I’ve ever seen I keep coming back to it because it makes me really happy but feel really lonely at the same time😅
did we just get a flash back to how Thomas met Nico - OR - Is this someone new
the paramore joke got me 💀
Omg his eye shadowwww OMG Y IS VIRGIL SO CUTEEE (as a fan)
Anxiety : “The lies..” *Deceit's theme song starts playing*
Bruh, why is no one talking about how Virgil legit just PUSHED Thomas into talking to Nico when that was exactly the opposite of what he wanted to do? And how he did it once he saw Roman's hurt face? Those two are best friends and just refuse to admit it
4:25 "That's just Markiplier" ~Me just now
Is that boyfriend???, If so YESSSSSsSSSsSSsSsSssSsSsSs!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally you deserve love!!!!!. If not, okay good for you!
im so sad that this is an animation
I WANT TO SEE GAY EYES WITH ROMAN NOW THOMAS.
This entire video is so effing relatable, but Virge telling Thomas to pace, pee and do something with his hands is the most relatable thing ever, I can't even  LOVE the animation. Soooo good
4:14 I just love Roman's grumpy lil face it gives me a reason to live
I like how if you turn in captions the name of the guy is just “Cute Stranger”
GOOD FOOD.
That nay nay gay gay go hard
Why am I crying!!!!! 😭
THAT IS TGE MOST ADORABLE THING I HAVE WATCHED TODAY!!!!!!!
"Shut up emo" I loved this entire episode and it made me cry 😭😭
“No no no, gay no. Gay? Gay! He’s gay!!”  The way he said this was so cute to me and Idk why-
Love the detail of virgil his emo eyeshadow, purple and shiny when very jittery and cheerful and then dark and big when questioning life choices
No matter how long ago this was I always come back to watch it, it is like one of my favorite things to watch when I want lol
Miss your story time
I really wish this was real
Okay all of you asking for a remade live action version of this, we're still in a bit of a pandemic and the team is working on other projects such as the /4 part season finale/   It'll come out eventually but 1 you can't rush quality and 2 they need the time since they're already really busy people
I would watch any animatic of this series!! The fan ones are already so great!
Gay! Panic at the Disco  This is what adult animation should strive for.
Is anybody out there feeling little sad for not being a guy? 🥺🤭🙃
When you want Roman and Virgil to date each other even though they are Thomas’s personalities💀
Ok wait so im not the only one with a little crush on virgil right
Wth am I looking at
i feel so much better after watching it and yes I am gay (and trans)
Thomas…. You do this outside of the house to… I think Joan is conserend based on the selflessness vs selfishness episode
It’s been a year and I watch this whenever I’m upset or feel numb. Thank you for this masterpiece!!
Where's part 2 ??!! ❤❤
PLEASE REMAKE THSI!!!
I love it how much money do you need to make it in color and not stop motion? Because it feels worth it
I love the way how virgil is just getting seeing roman sad makes him push himself / force himself to push Thomas
i just noticed that when thomas says "are we ready for this?" in the end credit scene, virgils eyeshadow changes back to black (BACKINBLACK) showing he still has a LOT of fear and doubt
Who else sobbed by the end?
Are you really gay
I think this is by far, my favorite episode. How relatable it is, all the interactions, g a y, and the storyboards! Amazing
I want to see this in live action!!!!!!
It’s been TWO YEARS NOW THE POOR PEOPLE NEED MORE
Someone was flirting with Anxiety in this episode……and it certainly wasn’t Thomas.
OUR *deadly stare* Final Form
12:43 and play the letter Patton wrote to Valerie from 'alone on valentines day'
I'm kinda shocked Deceit didn't show up with all the lying he was doing😆
You should remake this live action
Thomas I have so much to catch up on please forgive me  (aside from my stupid jokes, this is really cute and funny, as well as a damn good representation of how it feels to simply EXIST with anxiety. I love this so much.)
12:25  That’s like cyberstalking…….. but in real life   So stalking?   OH YOUR RIGHT
I cried... beautiful!
I was screaming with them 😂😂
11:13 sounds like badboyhalo kind of
I love it 🥰
AHAHA I GOT A ROBLOX ADVERT AND IT WAS STUCK ON THE SCREEN
the cuteness, i can't yall
Roman’s and Virgil getting along gives me serotonin lol
If this makes me ship Roman and Virgil I’m gonna keel over and die
prinxiety shippers are quaking
Rewatching this after going through the same time for like the first 6 mins in, friends literally shoved me to say hi to a girl I found cute.  Later my friends said I looked cute, awkward, but mostly weird from where they were watching. I was eyeing them to save me, I know I looked like a foul and I needed backup, but they left me on my own. In the end, she was straight; I felt so embarrassed asking for her number.
OH MY GOD THIS SCRIPT???? THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE EPISODES IT GOT ME SO EXCITED AND SO MANY OTHER EMOTIONS. ALSO VIRGIL AND ROMAN TOGETHER ARE AMAZING
PRINCIETY!!!!
“You were so…radiant”  My brain: RADIANT, CAREFREE, DREAMY
I have to say thank you Thomas Sanders it is thanks to your Sanders sides videos that I create my own personalities to help me cope with my different emotions and feelings was also came to my age when I was doing something bad to myself so thank you for inspiring me to create minds
Huh,,, Virgils eyebags change color depending on if he's negative anxious or positive anxious
I want to see more of this kind of concept. The drama,the characters Even the Most romantic moment ever,it deserves a sequel
This is movie level comedy! Great job!
Wow that was really great!
I love how when Roman was sad that Thomas didn’t Talk to Nico Virgil gain the confidence to make Thomas talk to him just to make Roman and Thomas happy. If that makes sense
That was so cute, "shut up emo" 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This speaks to me on so many levels   "I-I don't know! Plant?"
AHHHHH- THIS IS ADORABLE I CAN’T—
how did i miss this????
Idk why but I ship Virgle and the red guy ( I already forgot his name )
The intense second hand embarrassment is so real and I can’t handle it
I love how Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing. It goes purple when he's excited and I need that more in my life, honestly.
it's so funny i had almost this exact same situation happen to me a few months ago
This was the first Tomas sanders video I ever watched. My friend told me to watch it.
“No I wasn’t testing you- I was just panicking.”   M O O D
I **REALLY** hope the Jasico shippers can't find this video.
love it
Just noticed in the end scene Virgil had purple eyeshadow when he was thinking about Nico and then it went back to black when he was thinking about regular anxiety stuff I LOVE IT
This series says one thing...PERFECTION
I feel like the other sides are just watching this go down and questioning their existence-
I may be late, but notice how there is no logic in this XD
OMG WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED THIS!!!!! HIS NAME IS NICOOOO
Why Roman and virgil TVT i am bouta to cry dude they are making thomas stressed
Virgil saying he fears things too is so hilarious to me😂
Oh! Virgil's eyeshadow is just amazing!! Love the purple!💜💫💜💫💜
Gay or nay I'm choosing nay
I just realized in the end card that when Virgil gets all happy and excited his eye shadow is like a sparkly purple But when he gets more anxious about the situation it’s black ?? Really cool detail :D
i came here to laugh not apply for a therapy session
I'm rewatching the whole series and I just now realized how relatable this particular episode is!
It just struck me that it's almost 2022. *It's almost 2022.* This video was posted in 2020, and it's almost 2022. Well, late 2020, but still. This was the first Sanders Sides video I've ever watched. That... feels surreal.
6:49 I see what you did there...
I love this video so much this is basically me trying to decide whether I can or will flirt with someone 😂
Love is the most important ingredient besides salt
As someone who is ace, it is so strange for me to imagine seeing someone and thinking "that is someone I want to try and flirt with/date" based on just looking at them. But Thomas' videos are always great at helping me understand his feelings.
Omg it just kept getting worse
this is just thomas having a gay panic  edit: anyone else realise that virgil had binoculars when looking at the laptop, so why didn't they use those again to look at his bag?  another edit: if i where patton in the beginning of the intro i would've said pattreon, wasted opportunity.
This is a complete masterpiece! I can't even put it into words... just story, and animation, the design! 🤩
I think this is one of my favorite sanders sides episodes💕!
Virgil telling Thomas to move around and shake his hands in the end card is such a good representation of what stimming while happy feels like
We need more of this in animation
The second I saw Alex was in this I screamed      Which doesn't help because I'm sick
7:12 whats that music playing in the background
Thomas: this is very important for the story  Me when this came out: uh huh sure I know it’s for prinxiety  Me now: uh huh sure I know it’s for Thomas to get a love interest..and prinxiety
I can't believe it took me this long to notice Virgil's eye shadow changing colors. That is an awesome detail!
19:52 Omg! It adorable!😭❤💜
22:00 the bonus ending 😂 💕
this was so cute 💕
Virgil and Roman are my fav duo they just work so well together I love it
MY HEAD IS FULL OF QUADRUPLE THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF GAY THOUGHTS AND I LOVE IT
The photo at 16:57 sums up Roman perfectly
Something about seeing Virgil absolutely beaming with joy in the end scene is just... It's so Good.
i love the romance story
WHEN ROMAN KEPT HIS HAND ON VIRGIL’S SHOULDER I ALMOST DIEDDDDD ohmygod Virgil I’m the end card was so cute—and then Roman started talking
My favorite part of this video was from 0:00 through 24:13
PLEASE DO A REMAKE IN REAL LIFE THAT WOULD BE SO COOL!!!
Did anyone else notice the eyeshadow under Virgals eyes or am I going crazy? If thats real, I am literally so happy!!!
Most realistic romance story ever.
oh my god, virgil was just amazing in that endcard! i mean, he hardly ever smiles in any of the videos, and now we get to see him acting excited!? this is just beautiful.
✨Gerard Gay✨
I cried. THIS IS SO CUTE 😭😭
did virgules make up just go from purple to black to purple and black again ?
Virgil isnt just Anxiety anymore he's Anxiety AND gay panic
Is the gay eyes thing real?
STOP PLAY WITH MY HEARTSTRINGS SANDERS!!!!!!!! I'm not crying, you're crying.....
Wait this videos a year old already? Geez that happened fast
I just noticed that Virgil's makeup is all colorful right at the end CAUSE THOMAS IS FEELING BUTTERFLIES AKA THE GOOD TYPE OF ANXIETY???? UGH THE DETAILS I LOVE IT
I love how Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he is exited!
Also the table hes sitting at it's the opposite of 69 it's 96 just saying
THEY BLUSHED THEY BLUSHED THEY BLUSHED ..... is Roman x Virgil a thing ?
23:27 What the- 🤣😂 Virgil, that comment was awesome
I love how Roman and Virgil have a topic they can agree upon. It's a little strange, them not bickering, but they've come a long way to work together to better Thomas.
Why am I smiling??????
OMG THIS MADE ME CRY SO MUCH I LOVED THIS.....
I saw this video more than a year after it was made. and my anxiety, perfectionism, and impostersyndrome has been stopping me from writing out a resume and applying for jobs. I don't think I deserve the opportunities I get given because I'm not good enough and won't live up to the expectations that I honestly just put on myself. But that push from Anxiety in the right direction that he gave you in the end? It was kind of similar to the one that mine gave me last Monday when I finally wrote out my resume and send it off to a company. That company called me back today, and I don't know if I get the job I applied for but they also showed me different options within the company for which I would maybe be a better fit if this doesn't work out.
“shut up emo” 💀💀
THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW!
‘SHUT UP EMO’ OMFG SHAKAVAJBAJWHSKS
i feel like this episode JUST came out and your telling me its been a YEAR?!?!  what the foy o-o
So we all ship Prinxiety after this episode? Cool, just wanted to check in
this is the millionth time I've watched this
Are you actually doing out with Nico????????   Because that is so cute ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎
Never been a regular watcher but have dabbled for many years and this popped up. It was beautiful and touched home for me. 😙🤌🏻💜
As someone with anxiety and is a dork, i would've opted to ask him out with a meme
i just noticed i was sobbing while Thomas was speaking from the heart in front of the mirror-
The cuteness of this is giving me heart palpitations
Thomas is gay im lesbian!?!?
I literally love this one. 😭
Does Virgil's eye shadow become purple shiny/sparkly when he is happy?
I literally JUST barely finished this and I want to watch it 100 more times!
I was screaming soooo much this is sooo awkward and cute and gay I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT
Okay but I can relate in the way that I knew my crush was gay because of a pride pin-
This was my fave
This is the literal definition of "gay panic" The answer to every single one of these is just "you coulda just asked"
14:20
I love the mcr reference oml
"A. Those jokes are old."  "You would know." GENUINELY burst out laughing at that it's so funny!
DUDE WHY DO PEOPLE SHIP THEM
I’m not gay but this struggle is so common with everyone when you like someone it’s so hard to talk them Because your afraid to be rejected and embarrassed this is relatable with people gay or not that’s why this works so well.
AHHHH I LOVE THIS EPISODE SO MUCHHHHH(ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
I love that Virgil's eye makeup keeps switching back and forth from Purple to black.
I finally have a name for myself! A PINTROVERT
This is the highlight of my night! Of my week! This is so cute and beautifully, the drawings, the voice acting, the storyline!!! Absolutely incredible job!
this was so beautiful
"Can we really have a relationship, if its built upon lies?" . . . tch'a- bu- you- WHAT!? Also WHAT LIES!? You were forcing Thomas to avoid the dude, not even lie! :'V You just wanted to be mean to Janice again.  (for real tho, can relate to the panic, but i want to seriously strangle both Roman and Virgil this time around)
Can belive i found dude from his old vines-
This was probably the most wholesome and scarily relatable things I’ve ever seen. WHY AM I JUST FINDING THIS NOW!
I WANT to WATCH THIS but it HUUUURRTS aaaaaaa please i can't handle even texting my friend without having a breakdown, being reminded of being gay irl IS TOO MUCH AAAAAA save me ;-;
"Nononononno...gay- GAY GAY HE'S GAY" man I loved that
Prinxiety
“I hate to rain on your black parade, GERARD GAY” HAHAHAHAHAHHA
Hi my name is also Nico lmao
Patton: in charge of morals and humor Logan: in charge of logic and dance moves Roman: in charge of hopes and dreams Virgil: in charge of keeping thomas safe  Janus: in charge of patreon
YOU CAN DO IT SIR THOMAS ! DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF BLISS , JOY, AND LOVE ! AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE WHO LIVED THIS EXCAT VIDEO WE  HAVE FAITH IN YOU MY FRIEND FROM ANOTHER BEND . LIVE YOU HEART AND YOU DREAMS
Virgo and Roman need to get together
It's weird of me to ship Virgil and Roman.                ....Unless?
Thomas: A), Those jokes are old. Roman: You would know.  Wait, did Roman secretly call Thomas a old joke?! Please tell me that I’m not the only one who noticed it.
Just noticed Virgils eyeshadow gets darker the more stressed he gets and man, the DETAIL in these gets me. It’s also a Major mood
This episode is amazing, I love the animations!
12:29 That's like cyber stalking... but real life Soo, stalking? OH! You're right!
Roman: Sorry to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay!  Me:😂🥰😂
Idk If this is intentional or not but it looks like virgils makeup around 23:49 has a purple hint to it & I like the idea of virgils eyeliner changing color or getting lighter when he’s happy or excited since it seems to get darker when he’s stressed
calling Virgil "Gerard Gay" is my favorite line
Virgil's eyeshadow changes from purple (excited) to black (anxious) in the end card.
Thank you Thomas for giving us this amazing series. And helping us with our stuff along the way.
❤🧡💛💚💙💜 so good. 😆 this brightened my day. Again
IT FEELS LIKE IM WATCHING A ACTUAL SHOW IT WAS SO GOOD BOTH THE PLOT AND ANIMATION , I COULDNT GET ENOUGH. I WANT MORE OF THESE LONG ANIMATIONS SO BAD 😩😩😩
So. Frickn. SWEET!!
Roman: what are you doing?! Thomas: i dont know….*plant*
I sheded a tear from the pure wholesomnes in this video. Sorry if I spelled something wrong
wait you’re gay? nice!
Sanders Sides would make an amazing cartoon
this is very gay ngl
OMG YES
Now I want a Lizzy Maguire style show where the sides are like angels on his shoulders
Thomas: "I just subtweeted about it" Virgil: "what did you say?" Thomas: "Had a good day today. Hee hee. Heart with an arrow in it." Virgil: *eyeshadow goes back to black* "huh. Delete it."  Wow. That one tweet killed his entire mood. Lol
Please this is my favourite sander side video
This is me with trying to say hi to someone.
Roman: dude that happens 30 times a day, PLS relax Virgil: DONT TELL ME TO RELAX i swear all the jokes and everything, this is my FAV episode 😭❤
Why do I feel like he should call it Pat-treon
wait ... thomas is gay? cool, good for u man
Would you please update, i miss the bois
This made me so happy for so many reasons
OMG VIRGIL X ROMAN
Me a bisexual reading the title at like 2:30 am with a bunch of suger: don't mind if I do
STOP WHY AM I CRYING
Oh my god I’ve been giving the same girl gay eyes for the past month and didn’t frickin realize
I love this animatic!! I would be especially ok if you kept it going
Gay panic if it was an mp4
I CAN'T AND WILL NEVER GET OVER THE END CARD!!!
I have related so much in my life
Roman: No you no! I hate to rain on your black parade Gerrard gay!  Favorite line just because there is a MCR Black Parade album reference
no nope nuh uh there is no way this is already a year old
Please do a little bit more of this
This is the gayest episode ever
Hey did anyone else have a flashback to the Legally Blonde musical song gay or european when the boy said his name was Nico?
There’s no way this was a year ago wtf
ok that was so cute! oh gosh.
16:55 to 20:00 (and the end card 22:21-24:13) was just **chefs kiss** AMAZING AND INCREDIBLY GAY I LOVED IT  Also social anxiety could be virgil and roman's ship name
been exactly a year! wow
Please make this live action whenever you can, that would be awesome.
ONE YEAR AGO! Just came up on my Snapchat memories ❤❤
15:40 idk if I’m just overanalysing but the ‘him’ could refer to deceit as well, considering the last episode. Knowing virgils character, that’s probably out on a limb, but I’m still really excited to see how the two interact after janus’s acceptance
Is no one gonna mention that Roman is now canonically taller than Virgil, cuz I will
will DECEIT continue to be the answer to all of your problems? Why wasn't Janus here?
I am not gay but I still think this is cool I don’t support being gay but I also I’m not telling people who don’t be gay I’m just like oh you’re gay OK back to the conversation
This video made me do a fangirl squeal at 3 in the morning
You should wach the video on YouTube tats name is Gay or European oh and best one is mha one
I watched this 300 times
16:29 is truly a work of art, best moment in this episode
VIRGILS EYESHADOW AT THE END I LOVE HIM
im sorry- BUT PRINXIETY- GOMGKRKDNKSBJKFDBC
XD i hope we get a few more Animaniacs in the future
10:54 NU!
Anybody notice but virglis  eyeshadow is purple when Hes exited
My cheeks are hurting now❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sooo cute
ITS TO CUTE! I CANT HANDLE IT!
I can't believe it's been 11 months since this came out I swear I just watched it for the first time 2 months ago
My enby friend and my genderfluid friend were complaining about how they didn’t know thomas was gay. I proceeded to stare at them with my mouth open.
This is just so cute
MY NAME IS NIKO OMG
Virgil’s eye shadow changing is so-  Awwwwww! And they all freaking out over a boy like high schoolers!
Great job on the art and the voice acting 10/10 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The fact this is about a year old makes me realise how old I am
I love the part where Virgil heard a dog barking and called the dog a demon 😂😂😂
Paramore you say? 😏
Anyone else notice that Virgil's eye shadow gets brighter when he's excited/ blushing?? Like a brighter purple??
Middle of junior high this came out and now I’m in highschool. I’m so happy rewatching these. Love you Thomas (still snacking on my crofters)
6:49 gives me “creep” from Radiohead vibes- I THINK THATS THE POINT-
6:50  "You're a creep, you're a weirdo. What the hell are we doing here?"  Was that?- was that intentional
I don't know why but this being an animatic made it better
This was so cute one of my favorite videos ever
I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT IN THE LIVE ACTION EVEN THOUGH IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE, I DID ENJOY IT SOOOO MUCH =))))))))
If I could, I would ask the sides what they think is after death, because what if after death, what if we just cease to exist? This creeps me out-
How much of this is just Thomas talking to himself in the middle of the mall?
Head Cannon, Virgil released how upset pincey was after the last sanders sides ep, and decided to help by letting them  go to the mall
this is so perfectttttttttttttttt
I love this
when roman said 'shut up emo' i saw hearts does this mean something or not
I’m rewatching this but... dANG the prinxiety shippers really won this episode💜❤️
Why do I feel like Thomas is trying to hint that he ships Roman and Virgil
I love how this video summed up is basically just “gay panic”
Virgil at the end is so energetic and I love it
IS VIRGIL BLUSHING AT ROMAN?!?!?! MY SHIPPPP
This is so cute I started crying
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGED COLOR! It went from a bright purple back to his usual black at the end of the video!
Ok 1 the animation was flawless and 2 that's the kinda stuff I'd do if I saw a cute guy😅
the animations are good
The thum nail remind me of that one meme that goes answer this question with a yah or a nay does thye mother know your gay
I watched this a while ago and Im still fangirling after watching it again
THIS IS SO GOOD!!
Shut up emo had me dyeing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The character in my profile pic is literally my creativity, her name is sunset and she is the Princess of the British angels.
its fucking Nico-De-Angelo
the table is #96 what do you get when you flip that round......
“Sorry to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay” is the best line ever and awesome fucking awesome
I’ve had a idea for a video for a long time “When Janet was still but hurt at Roman for making fun of his name so to get back at him he made all the other sides besides one of your choice and then a new side emerges Dr Picani as basically your inner therapist”
Omg! Janus take my money!
Let's address the real issue here. * WHATS GONNA BE THERE SHIP NAME *. Thomco our nimes
I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay literally had me shrieking 😂
Princexity(roman x virgil) shippers are freaking out right now 19:57
Me sizing up my crush in class like: *cue entire video*
SPOILERS: . . . . . . . just realized! the scene at the end ( 19:39 ) seems a lot like a prinxiety moment to me AND because they’re both facets of thomas that could, in a way, represent some form of self love or acceptance, which would make a lot of sense after the whole episode being about social anxiety and sometimes feeling bad about yourself because of it and just AAAAAGGGHH I LOVE THIS EPISODE SO MUCH <3
Omg yes I have see. This millions of times I love thissssssss
God even I awkward smiled at this
Virgal was wearing purple eyeshadow. PURPLE not black that is not normal
14:31 Janus inside Thomas's head: *chuckles sinisterly*
THE FACT THAT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE LITERALLY GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK AHHHHHHHH 🥺🥺🥰🥰💜💜
@Ashernotashley Gacha our OCS can meet up here
bruh ?
3:23 RFS Speed limit alarm
Virgil with excited purple eye shadow gives me life.
I have a headcanon where Virgil's eyeshadow turning to purple is representative of where your anxieties are washed away. The first time you have ever been happy without much doubt or second-thought, just basking in the afterglow of getting something you wanted without any reprecussions. I find it really cute imo :>
My life in a nutshell but expect the happy ending and find a boyfriend part😔😒
Thank you, Thomas, for this video. I’ve had social anxiety all my life and it’s hard to open up to people. Most of the time, I receive negative feedback. I worked at Taco Bell for a month or two and eventually I could tell some people were talking trash about me behind my back. This old lady told me “You need to talk to people. Are you stupid?” And that’s why I don’t open up. Just thinking about it makes me depressed. I feel like I’ll be hiding in the shadows forever. But your video gave me hope. Your story made me realize that maybe opening up isn’t so bad. So thank you, Thomas. You are my inspiration.
AWWWWWW OMG SO CUTEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEE
um idk if i should say it but are you gay
I KEEP RE WATCHING THIS HELP
Gay eyes to the world
I need more 😱😭
Where's Logan and Patton? Also, Cute Stranger is very cute.
I can't even tell you how adorable Virgil was in this. I loved it.
Tell me why I got so EXCITED over a story why am I only seeing this now
PRINXIETY IS CANON, PROVE ME WRONG
I love how virgil's eyeshadow goes from purple to black
Anxiety (I don’t remember his name-) reminds me of Micheal Afton in peoples Aus, just more……Emo……
What... what did Nico say at 16:23 ?????  WAS IT ANACONDA?
I cant believe I have been in this fandom for about 2 1/2 years, it's insane to me to think that time has flown that fast and just going back and watching these episodes is such nostalgia but in a good way :) love the content keep up the good work Mr.Sanders :)
I LOVE THAT HIS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE GETS EXCITED OR HAPPY
The amount of second hand embarrassment I got from this.  Good video, though, I love it
if this isn't by far the cutest thing ever
This might be the closest we will get to princy x Virgil
Shoutout to the purple metallic eyeshadow on Virgil this episode! Solid choice. I'm a big fan!
i this DID omg how did i not realize
Virgil's eyeshadow shifting is a lovely detail.
OMG, I NEED A NICO POV NOW
I love how when Virgil is happy his eyeshadow is purple and shiny
Does anyone laugh at the 16:30 part? Because Nevada and Anaconda have the same number of vowels
Dude I saw title and was like “ME TOO!!!”
"Clearly gay" why is no one using this God loving life-😂
VIRGIL IN PURPL3 EYESHADOW
Thank you so much, my cousin so came out as non-binary had trouble choosing their name, and after they saw this series they changed their name to Patton. You helped them get out of a deep dark hole, and that’s why I said thank you.
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYE SHADOW💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
That Blink-182 reference! I'm adding that to my 'Virgil' playlist right now!
So basically if I wanna boyfriend, I need to wear a gay pride button? Got it XD
this is so true how i feel
HAPPY VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW
Sir you do not understand how much I love your laugh
OMG!!! DO A PART TO I LOVED IT. I I’m not lesbian but I loved it 😍
17:17 Ok, but like, this scene with Virgil is super cute and Im in love. -Square
Okay, we all gotta be honest, Virgil is gay.
OH MY GOSH PRINXIEEEEEEEEEETYYYYYYYYYYY
I noticed three eyeshadow for virgil in the series. It would be applied lightly. Heavily then its purple. Fascinating
The ending made me cry this is so cute 😭
HOLD UP Roman didn’t say anything when Virgil’s eye shadow changed to purple which means that he’s seen it change before first hand and I find that adorable ❤️💜  Also plot twist: at the end Roman was planning a date for him and Virgil instead of Thomas and Nico and that’s why Virgil was trying to get Thomas to leave the room and why he was upset when Thomas didn’t have to pee     If you couldn’t tell I’m a huge prinxiety shipper ❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜
Janus' corridor of stored rewards My creativity: "chamber of secrets?" Me: oh shut up, no one asked
Awhhhhhh ♥️😍
Aw that was so FREAKING ADORABLE!!!
Would love to see this acted out!
8:50. This is wonderful absolutely wonderful
I hate to rain on your BLACK PARADE. Nice Mcr reference
I’m sure this is cute but me being aromatic made it rather difficult… normal people are weird
Boiled male carrots  Me: what my expression went from👁👄👁. ✨👄✨.  😶‍🌫️👍🏿
gerard gay
I'd like to imagine that this takes place after SvS redux and Roman and Virgil have teamed up because they're both pissed about Patton and Thomas accepting Janus.
i have very strong anxiety  some time im scared to go to sleep cuz these day i have a lot of anxiety because scool will start soon so i have a lot of nightmare and i live whit my anxiety and i cant control it some people just say you know that you look like tweek in south park and its true i panique at evryting
It was so cute! I watched like three times lol
Virgil asking Thomas to stim because he's so excited makes me happy
Ok... I'm sorry, but is it just me that is thinking that Roman and Virgil are putting so much emphasis on Deceit, and Deceit being absolutely evil, are being very contradictory, and blaming Thomas a lot... Like, I feel like they are the ones who made Thomas do a lot of the awkward things that ended up in him lying... Like they are really trying to put out there that Deceit/Janus having a spot at the table is a bad thing. I really feel like their prejudices against Janus and the other "Dark" sides are really shining through.  Like I love Roman and Virgil, but... chill, please... Not every little falsehood is intentional or even as bad as they are making it out to be.
WAIT EVERYONE SAYS VIRGIL USED TO BE A BAD SIDE WHICH MEANS HE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD SIDE OPPOSITE?!
Not gonna lie, i wish the guy from the bathroom finds love, a man patient enough to wait to flush so you can finish your monologue is a man who's worth it.
It made me smile thank u very much
2:25
I like the ending part. When Roman tells Virgil that he showed bravery by pushing Thomas, I like to headcanon that it wasn't actually bravery he exhibited. Instead, it was Virgil's fear of missing the opportunity to be happy that he subconsciously exaggerated by seeing both Thomas and Roman unhappy. This would also fit with Virgil's character bc he's the embodiment of Thomas's anxiety and bravery is part of Roman's character which is why he mistook Virgil's fear for bravery.  Tl;dr Virgil pushes for love in fear of being alone, but Roman mistakes that for bravery bc that's what he's used to.
Ok I knew this was going to be a trip but this video did the impossible and made me an emotional wreak barely half through the video! Such a roller coaster 🤯🤣🙈😭😳😍💘🤗🤩💕 <3
I wonder if he did or get a boyfriend I hope he did or will
"you can live like jack and sally if you want" "hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" THE EMO REFERENCES NSjbHBJnJzj
And people question why we ship Virgil and Roman-
"That's like cyberstalking but in real life" "So...stalking?" "🤨 OH YOU'RE RIGHT!"  This is it, my new favourite interaction between them
THE PRINXIETY
They should re create this irl
Nobody: not even Roman: literally not even Janus: Virgil: oh, no no no, I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking :) no, the UnIvErSe TeStEd YoU and you chose to be a LiAr
omg i jus got around to watching this ITS SO CUTEEEEEE-
Virgil: we can live like jack and Sally    Me: I see your blink 182 reference Virgil ☜ (↼_↼)
Working threw intrusive thoughts  The person name was Nico    This has a person name Nico as well   This it related to it    I Stan :3
Hold up hold up hold up. The trash can song idea ( 18:46 ) could be foreshadow for Thomas’s mental health in the series 😮
22:20 timestamp for myself
"Hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay." I quote T.S. Sides and MCR c o n s t a n t l y and now Gerard Gay is my nickname lol
Cute gay story time!  So I realized I caught feelings for a friend of mine, a realization that became especially obvious to me after he randomly texted me he was bi. After much gay panic, I tried to smoothly confessed by asking him why he chose to come out to me of all people. He said, and I quote, “I don’t know I guess I thought if I was the millionth person to come out to you I’d get a free toaster.”  Eventually, I ended up telling him I had feelings for him, fully expecting rejection. Instead, he replied with “so do I, since like freshman year.” I asked him if he wouldn’t mind having me as his first boyfriend, and he immediately said “I would like that yes.”  And then I told him “This is a hell of a lot better than a free toaster.”
THOMAS I NEED TO KNOW, ARE YOU ACTUALLY GAY??!!
BRUH WHY HAS TIME GONE SO FAST THIS YEAR,ITS ALREADY BEEN 9 MONTHS SINCE THIS WAS RELEASED-
I'm not really gay but to anyone whose ever been attracted to someone you've never met especially when you have social anxiety makes this whole animation very relatable. It made me realize that my life would have been different if I was brave enough to take that leap of faith and if I was just honest towards my feelings
I dont know why but nico’s voice reminds me of bbh from the dream smp
Virgil has become a lot nicer lol
Why hasn’t anyone pointed out “YOU CAN LIVE LIKE JACK AND SALLY IF YOU WANT” like hello????? Blink 182?????
I’m crying happy tears this is the greatest thing
“I dunno, plaant...” 🤣🤣🤣
Whoever did this art did such a brilliant, incredible job, I hope we get to see more!
Thomas, you’d be an incredible voice actor!
I need this in real life form SO BAD
This is, AMAZING
The Prinxiety feels, the story of Thomas and Nico, the art, everything about this. It’s so perfect 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
✨🏳️‍🌈G A Y🏳️‍🌈✨
"Uh idk... Plant....?"
Roman: All right, off to a bad start, completely wrong direction. …Ohhhh! …Ohhhhh…  Lol I love this part
22:33 is by far my favorite it's so happy and wholesome
lol roman and virgils little moment at the end was so cute
I’ve seen no one talk about the blink-182 reference. (We can play like Jack and Sally if we want)
What has he become ☹️
Sand isn't smooth, its coarse and rough and irritating and it get everywhere
He's like a more wholesome tomska
I love the detail of Virgil's eyeshadow/liner being all purple and shiny when he's happy and turning black when he gets more anxious
Me:sees them talking  GAY SQEELING ABHAJSKSKAIXKJXJSJD
19:53 this is killing me
Who's coming back to this episode after WTIT
I don’t cry a lot, and I am going through a lot rn, but I need this as like a gay movie. It’s so real I cried bro, literally how all introverted people “talk”
ANYONE BACK HERE AFTER THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS VID TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE SAME NICO??
stickers helping introverts communicate without speaking is completely accurate
Just subscribe 😁
“You can live like Jack and Sally, if you want… ;)” I adore the Blink-182 reference. Love you Thomas. <3 /p
This was so hard to watch as someone who experiences severe second-hand embarrassment but it was so WORTH IT! EMBARRASSMENT BE DAMNED! GO GET YOUR MAN THOMAS! Also I just love this animation and all the expressions and Roman and Virgil’s dynamic is amazing
So can this be like a Netflix of Disney series
Aw dude this made my entire week
When you're a guy, gall and non-binary pal : '¬'
Awww so cute
Wait why did I almost cry
I love how this video is nothing but gay panic and it's awesome so cute and endearing.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR BOIS
Virgil eye bags change to purple when happy and not worrying. He also keeps looking at Roman.
Jhehshhahsb I love this 🥰🏳‍🌈
Disgusting
NINE MONTHS LATER IM COMING BACK AND UGH THIS IS SO CUTE 😭😭😭
I've never seen anything as cute as this! Please show us more about him, are you really inlove with him? Are you with him now? Please tell us more!!!
Virgil: ahh demon
It's funny how he is talking to himself but yet it seems like there actually talking to each other. This is pure comedy while alo pretty adorable and sweet around the ending 👏
Virgil always try to do the right thing and I love him for it
Virgil is so precious 🥺
I relate to Thomas when I step outside, ever.
That dang dog Dude.  Nice use of alliteration there Thomas
Bruh I love the art tho
Every word is so steamy, I can't even.
Tbh I kinda wished Virgil and Roman kissed :|
I CRIED!!!!
Any PJO fans freak out upon hearing the name Nico? just me? *Sighs*
Hello there, the angel from my nightmares.
Did this actual happen that's my question
I literally almost started crying at the end it was so cuuuuute!!!!!😭🥰❤️
12:48
This is SUCH a mood right now
OMG TRUE LOVE
AWWW THIS IS SO SWEEET
too perfect. heart attack
Thomas I'm not sure if you read your comment section and I know that this is a little off topic but I think it's about time you were on the receiving end of a story time. Recently I had to take one of those medical survey things that you have to answer as honestly as possible (so Jannette (my Deceit) had to stay away from the passenger seat) and for the first time in my life (I'm almost 2o by the way) when I came to the question of "are you LGBTQ?" I circled "not sure" because I'm like 97% sure that I'm straight but the other 3% doesn't mind the idea of renting a house with like another woman and adopting a dog that sounds like a perfect life.
**jazz hands** *EVERYONE IS GAYYYYY!!!*
I WANT ANOTHER EPISODE IT HAS BEEN 9 MONTHS GIVE US ANOTHER EPISODE PLEASE I DON’T CARE IF ITS IN REAL LIFE AN ANIMATION OR A COMIC JUST MAKE ANOTHER EPISODE
"Shut up emo" my family and friends say this to me all the time.
11:02 is no one going to talk about that Jacksepticeye reference?   No? Just me? Okay then?
I love how Roman looks taller than Virgil because Virgil is slouching.
Virgil sitting on the sink  that is a surface that is not meant to be sat on.
This is actually just me before I had my friend confess for me to them 💀
Roman: Ugh, *pintroverts* WHEEEEEEEEEEZZZEEE
6:05
OMG THAT WAS SOO CUTEE
Oh my god it’s been 9 months already
Don't care what anyone says Virgil and Roman are cute together
I love this Sander Asides so much, I can't express
Wait Nico... isn't that the name of the gay man on the court in Legally Blonde Musical?
What's gonna happen next? How does that trip to France go for Thomas?
3:39 Is Roman giving Virgil a piggy back ride that’s adorable
Roman and Virgil are perfect match makers bc one is cautious the other is saying go do it and Virgil is the reason Gay panic exists
Is he gay? Or European?
Me when Thomas said "radiant" : ..Carefree..dreamy..Adrien..the fragrance
Roman: Thomas, you’re gonna have to speak from the heart.  Thomas: Okay. *deep breath* Well hey there, kiddos!
I cannot wait for the live adaptation
pls make more animations with slenders side ^-^
He’s not gay he’s obviously European
4:01 STAHP PLAYING WITH PEOPLE'S HEARTS, THOMAS
me, back again, binge watching 31 videos of an American guy talk about his emotions to deal with my own: 😌💅
I am a Straight person and I have Sanders Sides OCs based off of me and I'm a Princiety shipper and a Logicality shipper (I think I ship Janus and Remus too but they haven't had screen time together yet and I don't know what that ship is called) so I sometimes consider having my sides flirt with each other but that would make them gay and I'm not gay but then I think them flirting would just be me giving myself self love I don't know how this works at all someone please help me
I need to go rob a bank whose with me😆
What’s your name? Nico And your Boyfriends name? Carlos !!! No no I meant Carlos is my best friend HE‘S GAY AND EUROPEAN
I have to know Thomas do you have a boyfriend
THIS BRINGS SO MUCH JOY
R: What are you doing? T: I don’t know... *p L a N T*
VIRGIL’S HAPPY MAKEUP BLESSES MY SOUL IT TURNED MY BAD DAY INTO A GOOD DAY AND THIS WAS THE FIRST EPISODE I’VE EVER WATCHED OF YOURS AND I LOVE IT I’M SORRY I’M JUST FANBOYING RIGHT NOW MY GAY HEART HAPPY VIRGIL IS SO BLESSED-
“you can live like jack and sally if you want” I JUST UNDERSTOOD THIS
I love Virgil, yes please do this as a live a Temptation because I love seeing you perform, also would love to see all your old ones as animated videos that'd be awesome to so much work so little time hope you're taking time for yourself and love everything you put out thank you
OMG THIS WAS SO CUTE!!! I would totally do this if I saw someone I thought was cute. You're so relatable  and authentic.
Roman gay eyed Virgil…… think about it
19:57 my heart is melted- I can't tell if they even do feel the same but like- if they do it's so adorable-
I really wish sometime i could talk to my emotions like the sanders sides, there are times in my life that this moment right here happens but i never get the happy ending, and i waste all the opertunities i ever get in life and i over think things and always look at the bad side of life...i just wish i could look inside myself and talk about whats wrong but...yea sorry for rambling
I kinda love Virgil’s makeup like damn boi
Verge and Roman made me even gayer somehow
This is some of the most relatable art I've ever seen :'( So cute
I'm Nico too, but not Flores, btw.
I just told my mom I’m lesbian
I feel bad for the guy in the bathroom:(
I feel bad for the guy in the bathroom:(
I wish I could be as funny as roman ;-:
4:32 Everyone is gay on the inside
im sobbinggg
I love this! Soooooooo cuteeee!
Omg that was so cute
I now ship Prinxiety…aha.
Roman: Join me, no thinking *proceeds to plan a trip to France*
This video is me in a nutshell except I end up running away from the situation 😂
Y'all are sleeping on the confirmation that Virgil controls Thomas's stims. Just saying.
EMPHASES ON THE OLD!!!!! XD!! I CAN'T!!
when i saw the title i legit thought someone was flirting with Virgil
Happy pride! (Hey do I feel like ur bi please don’t take this as a offense-)
blushy/excited virgil is so adorable omg
LLORÉ DEMASIADOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love it so much!❤️❤️❤️
this will forever make my day
This is me when I try to talk to a cute girl 😭🤚
thomas definitely ships prinxiety
Is this a true story
i loved this so damn much
Thomas really be flirting with Micheal Mell
_no one else saw the hearts when Roman said "Shut up emo?!"_
Roman: I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay  My brain: Processing it  Me: Dying of laughter
I'm the b in lgbtq+
I love when Roman and Virgil are repeating "Shut up"  It's so wholesome and gay that meh heart sings!!
Ok wait this is adorable so so so so so cute I'm dieing its cute!!!!
Those hates are from people who like talking
Virgil: sees Roman being sad Virgil: f-my hubby sad- *proceeds to push Thomas*
My heart 😭😭😭🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
So…much….prinxiety…
Lmao the opening
Virgil- I don’t know what that was   Roman- Bravery  Me- Nah dude, that’s what you call a gay panic 😂  He be crushing hard over Roman tho 🥴😂
I love this to much it hurts
Oh my gosh the little details!! The lil motifs on the microphones❤️❤️ 6:28
"Idk plant"
⟟ cried so much.
Honestly I'm proud of you man
The real question is, is he gay, or European?
How did I go to happy, sad ,and then happy again
I HOPE I’m not the ONLY person who noticed how Virgil’s eyeshadow was purple towards the end and then went back to black as it cut out.
As a straight man, i absolutely love these animations. The fact you respect others so much that it causes you anxiety is beautiful.
I LOVE IT I CANT STOP WATCHING IT ❤❤❤🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
15:40 "Will _deceit_ continue to be the answer to all of your problems?"  I have,,, so many thoughts,,, jAnUs Also, I feel awfully called out, I'm going to be crying in the corner if you don't mind.
I searched up gay panic animatics and got this  I do not regret anything
Ok but I got butterflies in the stomach when I found out that he was gay and  wanted those two being cute it was amazing
When he said "let's not waste this one" I LITERALLY squeled out loud. Everyone in the room thought I was crazy. It was SOOO cute. I'm not gay, but I do support the pride community and this was the cutest thing ever I like, died watching it.
I just got this- Roman. Romance. Roman. Romance.
I actually died and went from watching peacefully on my bed to ALL OUT princiety MELTDOWN IN MY SHOWER 15 mins after it came out.
“I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay,” KILLED ME WHY IS THAT SO GOOD?!?!??!? I’m gonna call him Gerard Gay now holy $h!t!
Oh my god I'm gonna cry this is so cute I can't-
I dunno... plant
Thomas: don’t look at me!  Virgil: no do look at yourself Thomas because that was a test and YOU FAILED  Thomas: you were testing me?! Virgil: no I wasn’t testing you- I was panicking no THE UNIVERSE WAS TESTING YOU.
This made my day
I don't know if anyone in the comments knows what a dissociative system is, but as one, the sanders sides make me feel very comfy. thank you thomas
This felt like the shoulder devil and shoulder angel ngl
Yeah. Seems about right.
The Shippers are quaking
Me trying to figure out what I am: **thumbnail**
Awwwwwwwwwww
just watched this after confessing to my crush yey
*fangirls* OMGOMGOMGOMG
Aaah this is wholesome:3❤️❤️
oh my gosh this was so cute and real AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Thomas 🥺 (Also Prinxiety needs to be a thing)
Dang it! This got me in the feels.  *SNIFF Waaah....😭
This was needed
:)
You want to know How I found sander sides I think it was because I liked watching animatics around songs and in my recommended one day was spinelly’s song with Duke singing it as an animation and well next up was intrusive thoughts and that is when I realized who I was watching. The wholesome viner  who made me laugh from old vine compilations. And that is when I found this fandom and have been sucked in ever since and I am just so happy to watch another animatic with this but it is actually canon
I cannot tell whether the art or the story itself was more beautiful.
yo what the honk this was 8 months ago?  did it really take me this long to finally finish the episode? i don't even remember how it started but this is cute 🤍💕
Sooooooooo FUCKING! CUTEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
I never been here but seeing when the last video is , I miss you.
That was soooooo cute
I love how Virgil has a popcorn box.
I'd LOVE this as live action whenever COVID is done 🥺
When the subtitles said "_guy in bathroom_" for some strange, unknown reason, I thought it said "_Brandon_" so um, yeah. I guess that's his name to me nOW-
Roman: Thomas, you're going to have to try... speaking from the heart. Thomas: **sighs**  Ad: _What up my dude and dudettes-_
I really love this it reflects my life
How quickly Thomas can change/get into character astounds me, I- I just love him. So much.
It’s been 8 months? I simultaneously feel like this was only posted a week ago while also feeling like it was posted 8 years ago lol.
am i  eating in my room and thinking ooohhh
Virgil was more scared of NOT trying than he was of trying. That's a unique form of bravery only an anxious person can perform. He beat the system!
DUDE DUDE DUDE I HAD BUTTERFLIES THAT ENTIRE TIME WHY CANT THIS BE MEEE
"Let's not waste this one." SHUT UP SHUT UPPPPP
9:50 I have to pause the video and stop watching because this pains me
This was beautifully written and I loved it
AHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHH FUCKING PANIC
This popped up in my recommended feed and my fucking eyes almost popped out of my skull. 8 MONTHS?? ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS?? HOW? MY CONCEPT OF TIME MUST BE REALLY FUCKED UP 'CAUSE IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS AT THE MOST 4 MONTHS AGO. WHAT.
Is it just me or did the end with Virgil and Roman seem like Roman was flirting with Virgil
this is so cute
That was amazing! 🤩
This is so beautiful I might cry 🤩😭 oh my gosh ahhhhh this... This needs to be a movie it is so much better than any ANY Netflix show I've watched it's just so perfect *chefs kiss*
22:23 This is probably the happiest Virgil has ever been (Also this is kind of a small detail but it’s very cute anyway his eyeshadow changes from purple to black whenever he’s happy it’s purple and when he’s like regular it’s black)
Patton,Logan,Remus, and Janus: * Having a sleepover while this is happening *
Imagine how weird it would look to a bystander if they couldn’t see Roman or Virgil
who want bloopers of this episode CUZ I REALLY WANT BLOOPERS OF THIS EPISODE
okay but the art style??? Gimme a full cartoon in this style because this is beautiful, I keep going back and rewatching bits just to look at the drawings
Bruh this makes no sense anxiety is falling in love with creativity? Like wth these are emotions liking each other-
It’s been 8 months
I love this :))
Many things resonated here. Is this actually true for you? Can't be, right? How would you have so many friends with this kind of social anxiety?
Is no one gonna talk about that end card
7:45 the table he was at said 96
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH AAA
This is the most cutest and gayest thing I've ever seen😍
We need an animated series about the romance between thomas and nico!!! This is too cute!
This reminds me of Michael and Jeremy
Ok so at the end there where a whole bunch of romantic shut ups said and then Roman said, "Shut up emo," to Virgil. Am I the only one who thinks this means something?
Lol this is just gay panic
*Don’t lie, this isn’t your first time here*      And it won’t be your last
I (and probably all Prinxiety shippers) am totally down for seeing this in live action, this has got to be my favorite episode to date
I would like to thank you , I just found your channel and I am a little obsessed with it , but your are makeing me more comfortable with my own sexuality and depression and anxiety so keep going . Thank you xoxo
Sees stickers on laptop* Roman:pReEtY gAy
This episode was just Thomas wanting to show prinxiety.
Still now new episodes? Damn..I was hoping it would be updated :(
OMG I LOVE HAPPY VIRGIL HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW _P U R P L E   E Y E S H A D O W_ this is so perfect, pls, make him happy more often
thanks, now i ship prinxiety now im shipping basically the guy with himself im disappointed with me
i rewatched this because.... thomas but u know i cant get over virgils purple eyeshadowwwww!!!!
ROMAN X VIRGIL CONFIRMED??
Man after all the crazy stuff form the last few episodes, it nice to have a relaxing fun Virgil and Roman episode about a crush at the mall.
Can we have a creators commentary? I think that would be cool!
6:50 THAT RADIOHEAD REFERENCE AAAHAHHAAHSHHASHHSKND😭
I loved this video It was inspiring in a way And so danm relatable Also, i think now my family hates me for all my squeals at the Prinxiety
It's been 7 months?! And he was watching an R+ movie XD
Ion knouu..plannn...
Dude I just love seeing Virgil being so flippin happy man
I absolutely love that Roman’s immediate reaction to the trash crash was to hide inside the bin
Meanwhile Logan at home stuffing his face in crofters
RODJFKSJCKSJFKDBW I LOVED THISSSSS OMG IM CRYINGGGG
Wait has this happened before is that why it is a great story?
;;-;; <333333jiefiehuifwifryiyifuieahufgufk
so awesome i hate anxiety!!!11! >:(
The end credit it make me feel like they are like a girl sleepover or something
So cute
This in live action. Yes absolutely yes
That was adorable
3rd time watching this and I just noticed the visual storytelling with Virgil's eyeshadow.
We need a sign for this like winking or something!
Even tho im not gay,i have always found it hard to express myself, and say the right things, recently my crush and i expressed our feelings for eachother, yet i never know what to say anymore, and when i come up with a good idea, i wuss out, any pointers, ik follow thru is a answer, yet its not that easy.
THE STIMMING AT THE END- *I FEEL SO REPRESENTED*
5:34 awwwww Romans so cute the stupid himbo
Janus' corridor of stored rewards is amazing
This was SO.  CUTE!!!!
My best friend has social anxiety and is this on point guys
Is this bast off a true story???
I love ada illustrates! They did some fun sander sides speed paints
This is so fantastic
Awww this is so cute I love it!!!
It's canon prinxiety is canon
I think I started hyperventilating in the middle of that 😂
SHUT UP EMO that line still kills me
HIS SPEECH IN THE MIRROR IS MELTING MY FUCKING HEART RIGHT NOW
VIRGIL WITH THE EMO SONG REFERENCES IS FEEDING ME
☺☺☺☺☺
I just rewatched this rn and i forgot how much i loved the part where they were like Roman: what are you doing?? Thomas: i’unno, plant???
THAT WAS SO CUTE. Also kinda accurate for my life
This was so amazing I-
Thomas: Is that... John Malkovich?  Roman and Virgil: ... *Moving on-*
May I suggest that virgin and roman react to prinxitey incorrect quotes by Demon EI x ( if I do get mentioned in a video pls don't show my name)
What is everyone thinking when they hear this random dude talking to himself and jumping away from nothing
WE NEED THIS AS LIVE ACTION 21 OUT OF 10
"hush hush hoopla" is now my favorite way to describe secrets.
This is my first one of this guy’s videos. Is he a DID system? Not trying to be rude. Just curious.
Anyone else a little confused on the eyeshadow bit ?-? Like does it change when he gets happy? Does it change colors all the time now? Is this gonna be a thing? Does it just change colors when he gets fidgety? Isn’t he supposed to keep them grounded, cus right now he seems pretty hopeful! ..... yes I’m scared and I just drank 3 cups of coffee.
"For my next trick i will transform myself into a very old man"
5:41 this explains the entire video
Hey there Thomas I also have social anxiety, it’s a really hard thing for me because I’m in high school and there’s a lot of pressure in high school when it comes to interaction. Do u have any tips on trying to get out of your comfort zone? Btw I still watch your old vines!
but the guy in the bathroom was cute and sweet
Oh hey my name is Erin/Eireann Kelley lol
when thomas started to do the gay eyes it went to a dominos commercial 🤣
idk why but i ship virgil and roman
Honestly that A Prince’s Ransom tier on the Patreon looking awesome right now.
ok, but can we get a real version of Nico's song, because the whole trash metaphor is like my life.
Roman: *gay panic* Virgil: *gay panic* Thomas: help. Me.
this resonates with me so much. i actually started to cry at 12:50. growing up with social anxiety is hard as hell.
Every other time Virgil has smiled, it's been this awkward, half-choked smile. I always thought it was meant to mean how unused he was to smiling. This scene at the end, though - that was the freest and sweetest he's smiled. Heartmelting
You mad me cry
i feel like this was less flirting with social anxiety, and more flirting with Anxiety
You don’t understand how much i loVE this video omfgiuy4wgrciuy4v
Oh no I’ve done it again...invested in a fake love story...😭
10:46 me irl
I ship Roman and Virgil
2:24 start of the ep! <3 22:20 ending Continuation! <3
This is so cute it makes me wanna cry!
AHHHH I can’t my heart ❤️ it’s so CUTE
"I don't want me to be doing this either!" 7:07 Did Thomas just reference john mulaney??
Thomas: Great, he's Gay. . . Virgil: Great, indeed. . . Roman: Great INDEED!
10:35 Virgil: You're making a mistake! Roman: If I am, I'll add it to the list!
I love that roman keeps calling him verge! It's so cute!
IT'S BEEN SEVEN MONTHS I NEED A LIVE VERSION RIGHT NOW
Guys! Turn on the captions when Virgil and Roman are talking over each other! (16:13) Also, something really cool I noticed, they say some words and the exact same time- call, what(‘s), tell, text(book), and not!
WE GET IT UR GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s face it, this isn’t your first time here.
When Virgil us happy purple increases when he not happy black increases
Virgil gets a lot if anxiety attacks
I noticed that Virgil's eye shadow changed from purple to black when he started feeling doubtful. And back to purple when he felt hopeful.
How is walking up to someone and complimenting them on their pins to strike up a conversation stalkerish? They're displaying that information for all to see you're not a stalker for seeing it.
Alt title: roman and virgil make thomas confused for 24 minutes
This was so incredibly moving... Great job as always, Thomas!!
I was kinda hoping Janus would show up in the cartoon
“It’s like cyberstalking but in real life” “So.. stalking?” “OH YOUR RIGHT!”  “Nothing but a bruised ego” *narrowed eyes intensified* “Hm”
As someone with social anxiety I am in physical pain watching this and I’ve had to pause it for breaks multiple time but it’s also freakin hilarious
Sampler side .... how terribly punnerific fumble
Me: doesn't put stickers on my laptop because I have sticker anxiety and I don't want to stick them anywhere because what if it's the wrong place? And you can't take the sticker off in one piece and I'll never see those stickers again once that laptop is gone. So now that cute little Eevee sticker is gone forever!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
This video was so hard for me to watch because anytime something embarrassing happens I Felt the anxiety  and I hated it. But also good video
16:08 me when any attractive boy looks in my general direction. the gay panic-
I LOVE GAY STORIES THEY R SO CUTEEEEEEE
This was amazing
10:36  WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS I CANT ROMAN—
Roman: what are you doing??!  Thomas: I-I don’t know-!? Plant-  My favorite sander sides quote of all time.
Thomas: Only a bruised ego Me: Yea.
If I ever win the lottery, I am becoming a patreon. Maybe invest some of it in my future, or whatever, but mort importantly, patreon
"Let's not waste this one" Nico, I officially love you, PLEASE BE GOOD TO THOMAS😭😭😭  " *bravery* " Me: *convulses with delight*  "Shut up, emo" ohmyGODDJAOBSWLNSKWNZKSN😍😍😍😭💖
Ran and Virgil are Thomas' gay panic🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I saw you across the foodcourt, and you were so...  *r a d i a n t*" Me: *chills* holy heck, that was amazing 😍✨😭
"You're making a mistake" "if I am, I'll add it to the list" Oh my god, that was angstier than I thought ಥ_ಥ
"We don't know if he's *not* gay You have used that argument on me far too many times. " Me and my brain when we see a character that's pretty gay and/or bi on tv:🤣🤣🤣
me: *pauses 47 times by the time I get 15 minutes in 30 seconds later: *pauses AAAAA I CANT- THE FEELIES IS GETTIN TOO REALIES
I cant afford the patron so I'm kinda mad the bloops are pay only now :(
I WANT MORE OF THESES VIDEOES PLZZZZZZZZZZZ MAKE PARTSSSSSSSSSSSS >*<
"Will deceit continue to be the answer to your problems?"  Deceit: *showing up ten minutes late with Starbucks* I was summoned?
did anybody else realize that when Virgil gets scared his voice does a little echoey thing
I've seen this so many times that I've memorized the ENTIRE script
Love ur gay song🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
As soon as the animation started i had a ad ._.
Lol...THOMAS...
AHHHHHHH my princeixty heartttttt
The only thing keeping me going through this pandemic is the thought that this will be remade as live action ❤❤
I love your laugh ugh I can't.
This truly is my favourite episode of Sanders Sides to date, in part thanks tó the animation. They are vivid and gives great opportunities for interaction between Thomas and the Sides, like the pushing. So for me, this one does not need a live action remake. Just like the Disney classics, the animated one is a gem ❤️
omg that was adorable
What I don't understand is why is Roman making fun of Thomas's age when HE IS THE SAME AGE???
Did anyone notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing colour in the end card?
Happy birthday Thomas my favorite Taurus❤️
Ok but listen to my amazing idea- Kallmekris and her characters meet Sanders Sides. My creativity is on a roll.
Damn. This is deep.
11:00-11:05  Me- o God  Every JSE fan- o no you've awoken the Gaelic gladiator Jacksepticeye- who dares say my old intro All of us- *runs and yells* GOOD LUCK YOU’LL NEED IT!!!!
The best episode yet, jesus christ this man and his team is a true work of art
me trying to enjoy the amazing animatic:    a random ad: HelLo wOuLD yOu lIKe tO plAy rAiD SHadOw LegEndS????????????
If Virgil has this secret thing that happens once he’s one of the “good” sides (purple eyeshadow) does that mean Janus does too? Maybe Remus too but probably not.
Dog: Barks Virgil: *AUGh DEmON*  VIRGIL'S HAPPINESS AND PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END IS SO ADORABLE
I just realized the title is referring to Thomas flirting and not Roman flirting with Virgil
Why do I feel like at the end Virgil was holding back from telling Thomas not to pressure himself into a relationship
Animated Thomas is so gosh darn smoothly drawn
Please do this again with Logan and Patton!
This is beautiful🥺🤧
‘Pin-troverts’ XD!!!!!!!
Me:ohhhh finally!!!!They will be so cute couple!!!!  Roman touches Virgil’s shoulder   Me: * die in happiness *
Needed this 😊♥️
This is literally me... except only virgil... I'm virgil.... and dont talk with people.... oh God I'm going to be alone forever
Ah yes XXXexpeert
I swear...... THIS SERIES NEEDS TO BE ON NETFLIX OR SOMETHING 😁😁
Roman and Virgils reflections be looking at Thomas😭 13:48 13:57
Wish I could afford patreon 😭🥺❤️
12:40 Roman: your going to have to try and speak from the heart..   Patton in his cat onesie eating a cookie: huh?
Roman: I hate to rain on your black parade Me:... MCR???...
Vergil: 🎵 your a freak your a weirdo 🎵
"he has a basketball pin, it's gotta mean something," ".. that he likes *basketball*--"
How long is too long? 6 seconds  I have a feeling Virgil liked Vine
My internal cuteness overload scream got out and my sister from the other room asked if I'm okay
The sides got to be in a cartoon again!
*Dude comes up to him*  Mind: GAY PANIC GAY PANIC!!!! Thomas: Hi..?
Prinxiety shippers are writing..
"Huh... delete it." is what I am always thinking when on the internet
5
Did anyone notice how Virgil seemed like he wasn't ready at all and really anxious about it at the end when Roman said they were ready if "he" was ready or am I the only one who noticed that?
The one time word vomiting works out for someone.
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW THOUGHH, I LOVE THAT PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY
-1:19
Im shipping hard
never thought i'd see virgil and roman teaming up wth--
idk why but the '' I did *not* have to pee'' cracks me up so much  also 7:42, 16:25 and 23:25 are a absolute mood XD
Okay that. That was stupid cute. My heart..
19:56 I know the "shut up emo" wasn't directed like me but I feel like it was lmao
i am internally screaming and all i gotta say right now is say ah and im a simp edit: I shall go cry now
this person did this thing were they draw sander sides cahrectrers till you notice them. here is a link to were i found it: https://youtu.be/TOsTVDlsBXA?t=160
This gave me a gay panic
omg i love this style
I love the eye shadow switch at the end, but I don’t think it’s Virgil being “happy”. He’s been anxiety, fight or flight, so it makes sense that his function as “adrenaline” would kick in during excitement and stomach-butterflies. It may be a part that viewers missed, or misinterpreted, but I love how it rounds out the character and adds more brain bits in the mix :)
Animatic comes with love  But with Thomas’s it is nonsense with new twists  It is you what to know if some on is gay ba ba boi
I just thought about this... if Thomas gets a brain freeze does that mean that Logan will freeze?
Try to paint it🥺🥺🥺
I don’t think you know how many time I’ve watched this and wished I was alone so I could scream-
Awwww I couldn't stop smiling!!!🥰
I just realized that Virgil is literally Thomas’s a n x i e t y, meaning that he’s alsO HIS GAY PANIC-
2 things, that was the nicest way to silence someone and PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE!!! It's so cute and Virgil is growing and Romans gay eyes are just *dies from cute overload*
THAT WAS SO CUTE WHAT THE HECK
OMG I LOVED THIS OMG yEEEEEEEEE there Hass to be a part two or something👁👄👁
“Shut up Emo”  I think I may die from shipping
0:00 oh yeah
On patreon it all costs. So where is the free stuff then
I still have to pay to watch anything.
I feel this on a deep level.... I NEED MORE PINS
SOOOOOOOO CUUUUUTE!!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀
Virgils character development: Creepy anxiety---- friendlier anxiety who actually tries to help------ GAY PANIC VIRGIL
i just realised how long ive been watching you for- im pretty sure ive watched you since i was at least 8 years old- AND IM ALMOST IN HIGHSCHOOL-
I'm all for seeing a live action version of this but PLEASE keep the exact same inflection for "I dunno...PLANT" at 10:46, it is so cute oml
This whole video was just * Gay Panik *
14:20 the exact moment i paused the video, and stared at a wall knowing disaster had struck. f*ck.
“Your making a mistake!”  “If I am I’ll add it to the list!” ROMAN ADD ME TO THE LIST OR YOUR HETERO..or just stupid 😌
bois
Ok but why does the cute stranger look like mazz Im sorry, i just-
Wait.. i realized something like this kinda happened to me
So here’s what I think happened in the mind palace with Virgil and Roman after the last video: Virgil: hey sry I was playing just dance- Virgil: holy BLEEP what happened?? Roman: well... I-it’s a long story, but to shorten it... Deceits on our side and all that. Roman: or “Janus” now Virgil: oh crap... w-well, uh... Virgil: geez I’m terrible at this comforting stuff...  Virgil: w-what if we uh, go to the mall? You usually like that stuff, right? Roman: pf, like you would want to deal with all the people. Virgil: uh, yeah I wouldn’t but... Thomas probably needs to get out of the house at some point. To get his mind off the wedding and all that. Roman: oh... well, sure! Going to the mall sounds great!  Roman: ooo! Maybe he’ll find “the one”~ Virgil: whatever you wanna think, princey  Sorry, just had to get that out. I like to write and this thought just came into my head and wouldn’t be able to deal with myself if I didn’t get it out. :3
as a lesbian i find it amazing he even talked to the guy
6:24 this is literally me on a daily bases ;-;
are you and nico dating?!?!?!?!
This is when everyone knew this ship was cannon
O MY IREN IM CRYING 😭😭😭😭😭 #GAYPRIDE
THE HEARTS NEAR ROMANS FACE AT THE END WITH VIRGIL PPPPPRRRRRIIIIINNNNNNXXXXXXIIIIIEEEEEEEETTTTTTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Sorry to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay
6:50 I just realized this was a Radiohead’s “Creep” reference!!!
Alternate title: Roman and Virgil and actually working together just to bully Thomas
This made me want to confess to my crush
I wish I could become a patron but I can't, I really want to see the live version...
Yas a daily dose of gay 👌
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END YDJSJSBKSJWJVFKD
I hate That Roman said that Virgil likes bringing Thomas down cause, sure, in the beginning he was a token of Thomas’ anxiety, so he was a villain and all that. But now he’s the embodiment of his anxiety, like, it’s not that he was ya Thomas to feel down is just that he’s anxious and shares his thoughts, he is the anxious side of Thomas.
Everyone has to watch this with subtitles. In it the guy is named “Cute Stranger” and there are so many other things that are awesome. In fact, watch every episode of this series with subtitles. It makes it more fun.
So many peoples fan fics and animatics became partially cannon in this. (Especially VirgilXRoman ones)
THE WAY VIRGIL'S EYELINER GOES PURPLE W A CUTE HIGHLIGHT WHEN HE'S EXCITED OH MY GOSH-- Also Roman going "Yes, join me in no thinking!" like ok himbo
this is so great/
Who put salt in cake
Awesome I love it great work
The end was the cutest
I thought that Janis would be in the video
what a beautiful love story
I honestly love this :)
this is literally all the gay but none of the confidence
i ship it
Oh my god if I was there I would have just dragged him over to say hi   This is painful to watch
Just wanted to say that I love Nico so much! Please tell me he'll be a main character in future episodes and he'll have more cute moments w Thomas! <3 Love your videos, by the way! Take care!
Love that refrence in the first short to a vine he once did.
dark sides should be called slander sides
E
😤😤😤🌻😫
i love this so much
Roman: you're going to have to talk from the heart  Me: I hate myself.
Love it
So cute
Dear Thomas Sanders, I have this problem inside. It is a blessing sometimes. Anyway, lowkey I relate the picture in the clickable thumbnail in this video to the people inside myself as well. It is like an inside joke only we know about their problems. Thank you You have helped me very much Sincerely, Daniel
Please tell me that guy you met was real that was too cuteeeeeee :(
I wish this was real I want Thomas to have a happily ever after
I didn't realise until I rewatched this but does Vergil’s eyeshadow represent when he feels emotions stronger than his anxiety and that's why it kept switching?
"We dont know If he's gay"   " well,we don't know if he's NOT gay."   Me: wait A minute
I CANT GET OVER HOW CUTE THIS IS!! the amount of times i’ve rewatched this🥰🥰🥰
Join me!! No thinking!!
Nico be sounding a lot like Joan to me-
Roman: what are you doing? Thomas: I don’t know plant. I am dying🤣🤣🤣
I almost cried at the end. Thomas, that was amazing
ok but what if they did one of these videos in thomas’s dreams? maybe he’d been having nightmares and they wanted to find the reason behind them? idk why i think that’d just be cool.
DONT TELL ME TO RELAX me before literally every test
"lil' punk" I- the way he said it kills me everytime lol 24:04 "Ahh! DEMON-" y e s
Panic! At The Mall Food Court
I love the new eyeshadow Virge!
ALL OF THE PRINXIETY!!! At the end, just oh my gosh
I couldn't help but notice that at the end, it seemed that Virgil kept trying to get Thomas to leave him and Roman alone. Not to mention he kept looking over at him with happy expressions.
We need this on tv i love this so much!!!!!!
I thought he was the vine boy but no he’s just the creator of the most amazing thing wth
That was cute☺
Ayo Thomas you good? Bud are you okay
Me causally scrolling through the comments, finding one topic and cloudneal: 😳🕶️🤏
I loved "hurray, who's gay?- that guy"😂❤
That was so gay.......I LOVE ITTTTTT🥴🤪🤪🤪😎😎😎
My personality could be best described by mostly being Roman and Virgil. Like seriously. *bi panic* I make TikToks, oh no.
Do the sides have types? I see people shipping them and I am curious-
the end card too,, like this is the most upbeat we’ve seen virgil. EVER. he’s being loud, he’s excited, he’s feeling GOOD. hES HAPPY IN THE END CARD
“You can live like jack and sally if you want” ... I caught that reference
DID THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE IF IT DID- PLEASE SHOW ME THEM TOGETHER HEHEHEHEHEHEHE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
19:57 "Shut Up emo" MY HEART-
👍👍👌👌
Please make a real-life version of this storylines just too good not actually make a real thing please just do it I'm begging you
i just realized towards the end. when virgil is excited his eyeshadow is purple and shiny. but when he overthinks and gets anxious it turns back to black
disney needs to give this guy is own movie and/or show
this was cute👌🏻
🏳️‍🌈       But I’m straight.      Thomas I still support
Did this just confirm prinxiety or is it just me
Skip to 2:11 for the video not disrespect towards Thomas just if you are rewatching It is nice
PRINXIETY IS IN THIS EPISODE YESSSSSSSSSSSS
That was wonderful 😍😍 can u do it again in the next video 🥺🥺🥺
Did anyone notice that Virgil's eye shadow shifted, when more positive it was a shimmer purple and when more worried it was black? Or is that just my eyes playing tricks on me?
Things I love about this episode: "What lad is that which doth enrich the Mac on yonder slate?" "Huh?" "Ugh. Cutie at 12 o'clock" "I hate to rain on you black parade, Gerard Gay, but the only thing left to do is TALK TO THE GUY" "If I AM making a mistake, *I'LL ADD IT TO THE LIST"* "What are you doing?" "I dunno, plant-" "If you go in cold turkey, you might chicken out" Thomas' monologue in the bathroom The way Virgil and Roman look at each other during the monologue (I realize they're probably looking at Thomas but LET ME HAVE THIS) The dude in the stall crying about the monologue, thinking it was about him. Also, the way the guy looked so...hurt when Thomas said he was running lines "I so, so badly want this... I-I'm desperate for it, but... you can't have true love if the relationship isn't built on truth" Virgil and Roman panicking over each other when Nico came up to Thomas to give him his food Virgil pushing Thomas to Nico after seeing how sad Roman was Thomas confessing to Nico Thomas and Nico's basically first date even though it's not really a first date "In all honesty, I don't really know what that was..." "..bravery." "Shut up, emo. :)" "STOP, GET OUT! The episode's over!" (Roman ducks out, smirking) "Punk.... little punk.... anyways, about that Patreon! :D" VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT-- (Virgil contemplating...) (dog barks) "GAH, DEMON!" "Dude, that happens thirty times a day, please rela-" *"DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX"*    In conclusion, Prinxiety <3
*quietly tearing up at the gayness*
I have a feeling there's going to be another episode about relationships and commitment because of what happened in the credits... Also Virgil with purple eyeshadows,
Ok, I've been trying to word this right to make sense but it's not working so I'm just going to say it: pretty sure Logan was talking through Thomas at 23:14. It was just the way it was phrased really sounded like him. Idk, I could be reading to much into it tho. I mean, normally if I've noticed it, 10 other people in the comments have already mentioned it...
How do you make refuses deodorant i tried real one it tasted bad
I think it would have been best if you: (approached him looked at him and leave)
Ok, but can we just talk about how gorgeous Virgil looks with purple eyeshadow????
Amazing content it always cheers me up when I’m sad and I try to draw Virgil and am trying to get stuff to cosplay as him for fun
16:08
Just look at him and wink
VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE GLITTER EYESHADOW
This is beautiful
This felt like a Steven Universe episode and I love it.
Omg, loved it, it was so amazing! There were parts where is was like " ohhh no" and " AHHHHHHH!". I. LOVE.IT!❤🧡💛💚💙💜😁
Thomas is just teasing us at this point.
This is fantastic, I love how Virgil ends up being the one to push him (literally)
2:24 for those who just want to watch the beautifully done animatic. (thomas would like you to be a patreon btw)
Okay I returned to watch it again and this time yelled "HE ACCEPTED THE FOOD"
8:12 aka the entire I can’t dance song in high school musical
me want more sanders sides or even asides
I'm sorry but GERARD GAY AKHKAHGDKASH
I don't know if anyone commented on this or not but did anyone else notice that When ever Virgil was Excited his Eye shadow Got Brighter?
Wait he gay af
Are you gay 🥰💙😘😍😅🤩😚😫🌺🌺😻👌👍
It's no one gonna talk about how Virgil's eye shadow changed purple & Roman blushed at Virgil
13:57 Whoa the reflection-
I loved it it was cute I just can't wait to watch more
Love this new style! I would absolutely love a live action of this. Did anyone else notice the difference in Virgil's eye shadow at the end? Sometimes, it's purple and other times, it's his dark eye shadow? I wonder if there is a meaning behind that. :)
*slap* Top of the morning!
Did roman just call virgil gerard gay? 😂🤣😂🤣
This ALMOST made me cry. A-L-M-O-S-T.
I looooooooooooooooooooooooove the purple eye-shadow on Virgil! And the really happy excited face he makes whenever his eye-shadow is that sparkly purple is just the best!
i just rewatched this and a;sdlkfja;lksdjfa;lksdjf;alskdj so cute omg
Is he gay or european?
My favorite timestamps: a thread
Virgil may be anxiety and have social anxiety, but this shows he wants the best for Thomas, and the other sides. Virgil’s a real softy when you get to know him❤️
Not gonna lie I kind of needed this right now
Moral of the story: Always wear pride pins on your backpack
Can you do more of these?? This is adorable and amazing and amazingly adorable
Time out can’t Roman and Virgil just walk over and read the pins and stickers? Why do they force poor Thomas into these situations?
virgil has purple eyeshadow when he's happy/excited i'm-
"I'll add it to the list. " Fanfic writers (such as myself): * sniff sniff * I smell... A N G S T  P O T E N T I A L
@Thomas Sanders       You don't know me. I'm just another random person on the internet and I don't know if you read these but if you do I'd like to say thank you. Whenever I'm having a bad day and I just need a reason to smile, I know I can watch your videos and I'll immediately feel better. There's been a lot happening lately, both in the world and in my personal life (what with dysphoria, anxiety over coming out, depression, family issues, etc.), and it's all just been really overwhelming. There have been days where it's really hard to keep going. At one point I actually considered not continuing. Then I found your videos and all that around June last year and things started to get a little bit better. I had something to look forward to again.        It's not just about the actual content. I mean sure, that's a big part of it, but more than anything it's the way that you make me feel seen. Like I matter. And it's not just me, there are lots of people who appreciate that all-around kindness more than you might realize. It might not fix everything right away, but it is a really, REALLY big help.       Anyway, I realize that I'm rambling and if you ARE in fact reading this you're probably thinking "Man, this is a long comment," so I'll wrap it up now. I just wanted to say, from the bottom of my heart:  Thank you Thomas Sanders. You saved my life.
I love this ❤️
Okay, I’ma come straight with my opinion, even though I’m pan: this was the most amazing video ever and it had me positively beaming at the end at how adorable it was! I loved how real it felt, I loved the character design, I loved the heartfelt everything! It was, simply put, beautiful.
This made me cry 😢
This is the best thing I've ever seen, I've never related to something more in my life.
I feel so bad for the guy in bathroom
Can I say: I wish Janus made an appearance in the episode where they all sang about,”Lies lies lies liIiiIessss” ;-;, anddddd  Prinxiety is thriving!
this is relatable on entirely too many levels
captions: cute stranger
THAT DAMN DOG-
Wait, does Virgil's eyeshadow changing mean anything?
I watch this series to much when are y  ok going to add more T^T and even though there basically you I ship Virgil and Princeg so much ! I’m obsessed with shipping things in series movies and etc -_- ^^
aweeeee
The gay panic is just so real. 😂
Oof I thought u means “flirting with social anxiety(aka Virgil)
I’m gay too (hints the name) and that hit WAAAAYYYY to close to home
HOW AM I JIST NOTICING  when Virgil is happy his eye shadow goes purple 💜
Yep. 4 months later and I still cry. Even though I'm in a relationship now... Just call me Angelica cause I'll never be satisfied
I SHIP IT THIS IS SO CUTE I LOVE THIS I LOVE VIRGIL AND ROMANS DEVELOPMENT I LOVE THIS NIKOMAS IS MY OTP ALSO I NOW SHIP ROMAN X VIRGIL
Awwwww Cmon you have to see that there is some Princxiety happening there. 😂
tbh this kinda pushed me to wanna draw a bisexual flag on my door cause if i buy it i might get in trouble. hhhhhhhhhhhh. my parents aren't homophobic, their allies, but they think im having a identidy crisis. so HAHAHAAHAH, anyone? can i have help?
*slithers out of my cave* "Do I smell Prinxiety fuel????"
“walk around it helps somehow” “shake your hands i need you to do something” *only recently realized he has adhd*
THIS CAME OUT IN OCTOBER??? I THOUGHT IT CAME OUT IN JULY
I'm Bi so this hits me in the heart
SHUTUP EMO. THEYRE SO GAY FOR EACHOTHER SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GAY OMG HELP
Virgils purple eyeshadow💜💜💜💜
ok , sorry if anyone has already said this dont hate on meh :c but im too lazy to go through all the comments atm.. did anybody else see virgils eyeshadow change from black to purple and back-forth a few times-???????????
Is princey x Virgil canon now?
The way they switch from purple and black eyeshadow on Virgil is so good, I love the idea of his eyeshadow changing based on his mood.
This whole video gives me There Right There vibes (from Legally Blonde) and I’m not mad about it
I say this late, but this was a 14 day early b-day present! I love aniamatics, I love Sanders Sides, and I love the channel! Thank you. Edit: I just watches the whole thing. Dude- P R I N X I T Y-
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE.... GERARD *GAY*  YES
Prinxity is here... I can feel it
virgil is scary
Gerard Gay... I’m gone...
After watching it a few times (aka. a lot of times), i still am squeling line a mouse, because I am fangirling. I love your content and I hope that you and your crew are well during this time and thanks for doing videos ♡
Can someone help? I think I've seen all of them but I don't know who Janice is
As someone with pins on her backpack... You're not wrong
Im literally getting second hand akwardness from this. Ive been trying to watch it for ages but its just too strong!! (I am determined to watch it though as it is part of the main storyline)  Edit: I got far enough. not that akward anymore lol.
When Virgil is happy, his eyeshadow is positively purple!!        (Literally, look at that last scene.)
Awww!!  I come back for the shiny bright happy Virgil! The shiny purple when he's happy! :D 22:22
Omg you have a Patreon?? Take all my money!! 💸 💰
I asked out the person I’ve super been into for several months partially in thanks to this video. I thought for a second that I had missed my window of opportunity, but when the perfect moment came up I felt that little last push from anxiety (on top of the anxiety attack I was already having lol) and I just did it. He said no unfortunately, but in the kindest way possible. And I’m so so *so* proud of myself for doing it. I know I would have regretted it if I hadn’t, and I felt like a badass in spite of the not-super-ideal response. Thanks Thomas and crew for your help on this!
I love the fact that when Virgil is excited his under eyes are purple and then when he gets momentarily anxious to go to black
Omg this gave me second hand anxiety lmao And then I had a wheezing fit over Gerard Gay
Omg, I'm just now noticing the eyeshadow thing. That's so clever, how did I miss that before?
*WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW TURNS FUCKING PURPLE AND SHINY— I LOVE IT- ITS SO SMALL BUT SO GOOD-
I love the animatic style!!!!
sorry but virgil with purple eye shawdow
Can't wait for the next episode xxxx
I stumbled apon this randomly and OH MY GOD MORE I NEED MORE
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing colors in the end card?
roman and virgil are two halves of a whole idiot <3
Why can’t I look as cute as animated Thomas. This is unjust
Alternative title "man has gay panic for 24 minutes"
THIS IS ADORABLE AAAAA
AAAAAHHHH MAH HEART
GERARD GAY KILLED ME
Hey Thomas, I'm a huge fan. I love the video ❤️
This entire video is a prinxiety moment
Literally have never watched a single sander sides episode and didnt think i would butttttt Nows a good opportunity to watch it i guess-
19:52 PRINXIETY SHIPPERSSSS~ YO MOMENT!!!!!
PRINXIETY CANON WOOOOOOOO
7:20 Pfft I’m watching this for the nth time and just now cought that😂
I'M HERE FOR THEORIES ON VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW
"Liar."
that moment when virgil starts talking about lies, but janus doesn’t show up: [audable sadness, mixed with gratitude at the fact that this video exists.]
I would like all the prinxiety shippers to know:  *Roman probably wrote the title*
19:50 Ships have entered the chat
Thomas Sanders, you were a big part of my child hood, and you even helped me find out my sexuality. ( Which is Omnisexual ) Keep making videos, I believe in you! ❤️
...honestly, I saw the title, and the thumbnail, and my first thought was: “omfg prinxiety is canon”
GERARD GAY I CAN'T-
OOF this video was a little bit of an emotional journey 😭  this was far too relatable
So... is this a confirmation for prinxiety shippers? Or are you just mocking us nlw
omg I love this
Virgil shouting at the end “DONT TELL ME TO RELAX” and for some reason I immediately thought  “no one puts baby in the corner” for no reason at all
is thomas actually gay, and are gay eyes a thing.
I like the subtle Creep reference. Also Virgil with purple eye shadow is the best thing to ever happen on sanders sides
Part of me wants Virgil to transition to the purple eyeshadow permanently
I love this way more than I have any right to
Nico reminds me of Micheal Mell-
19:55 ACK that "shut up emo" was so cute!! and the little hearts 🥰 i feel like that confirms it, princiety is real😌
NICO DI ANGELO??
When Thomas said essential to the overall storyline I was like does Thomas have a boyfriend or is prinxiety a thing
I hate those 826 people who disliked this video.
who else saw vigils eye shadow change
This is awesome/hilarious
5:18 LMFAO I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS SUCH AN EMO REFERENCE WTF I LOVE IT
this is something I havent experienced but know is true because I might have done "the eyes" to somebody without noticing and just shook it off
why do i relate so damn much, i would love to see this as a life action vid
PURPLE EYESHADOW
Lol let the shippers rejoice also        When you gonna release a new dark side thomas 👁️👄👁️
WE ARE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH PRINXIETY THERE WAS AT THE END🥺🥺🥺🥺
All I heard was: GAY GAY GAY GAYER GAYEST
P.M SEMORE CALLED YOU A PRECIOUS FREAKING BEAN HE WILL PROTECT WITH HIS LIFE I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
This was such a sad story
The "is that fair to HIM?" line i was like is he talking about the cute stranger... ooooooor deceit?
19:29 *Priniexty fans have swarmed the chat*
I couldn’t stop smiling while watching this
I shed a tear ;v; that was so good. I love .... Well ... Love lol
about the patreon. this patreon is my metaphorical callback. its an oportunity i have to pass up for the sake of finantial stability but maaaaaaaaaaan i want the extra content ;____;
Omg this was so creative and amazing I love it ahhhh so cute. I can totally relate with the anxiety you fewl
"huh.. delete it."
If Thomas was speaking from the heart, does that mean all of that was Patton? AWWW WHSHSHSHIHGUYGYTFYGTFCYGVY
Virgil's eyeshadow changes throughout the rainbow depending on his emotions we already know black is anxious and purple is giddy/really happy but what about when be feels love
OK but can someone tell me is this is a true story or not
WANNA CRY THIS WAS SO HEARTWARMING
THAT WAS SO CUUUUUTE!!!!💜💜💜
thomas really went the gay or european vibe didn't he?
Okay, so that's me frecking out in a good when I hear a good thing, like a was so happy that in Jun if the this year we all gonna have a big party for my 60th birthday and all if the stuff we could't do because of COVID 19. I'm so excited!
This is amazing and I will squeal of joy
Virgil: GIVE A YEET!!!! *
I cannot pledge right now, but in three months, when I'll have finally paid off my car and am no longer dishing out $300 (and sometimes a bit more) a month, I will totally pledge to your patreon!
me still wondering if Nico was a real guy or not and if this was real and nerding out
its crazy to imagine one dude voice acting all of those 3 personalities
Roman: *“Bravery”* Sander sides theorists: OKAY GUYS THAT IS ACTUALLY THE ORANGE SIDE BECAUSE BLUE IS A CLOSE COLOUR TO PURPLE WHICH IS THE COLOUR VIRGIL IS REPRESENTED AS AND BLUE IS THE OPPOSITE OF ORANGE AND ANXIETY WHICH IS ALSO FEAR IS THE OPPOSITE BRAVERY AND OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS THAT ITS VIRGIL’S LONG LOST BROTHER WHO IS ACTUALLY TIED TO UNDERTALE BECAUSE THE ORANGE SOUL IS THE SOUL OF BRAVERY AND-
I’m crying the entire time he was talking to the mirror I just knew what was gonna happen and I had to prepare myself for the secondhand embarrassment
After watching this I think your gay
Why is nobody talking about the dude in the bathroom, he must have felt awful.
ok but the gay eyes works tho...
HE SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE JOAN because he is in the description TwT I’m soo stuupid
Nico Flores remember me of A.Ham, like.. so FREAKING much. I don't know why.
That was the most nerve racking video ever like the suspense
This is me but I never got pushed by my Virgil and I stayed alone lol
aaaaaaa abd illistrates - on a sanders side - yessssss
HOW DID I NOT NOTICE VIRG'S EYESHADOW BEING GLITTERY
I'm such a fan Thomas
OK THIS IS JUST PRINXIETY FAN SERVICE AT THIS POINT
8:41 questioning your life choices like 19:11 *Roman scoff*
i hope you are nay
i love the way the artist drew roman at 16:07 lol
Eventually I want to have one of Janus's schemes be totally interrupted by Remus and the serous effect ruined. 😆
This is great! I am loving it so much!!
shut up emo so cute
this video made me happy cry
THAT WAS NOT ONLY GAY AS THOMAS AND WHOEVER THAT GUY WAS BUT FOR THE STROM CLOUD  AND SIR SINGS A-LOT  IT WAS SO GAY OF THE HECK I LOVE THAT OH MY GOD AHH I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCHHHH
Ok so I am blasfemesly late to watching this, mostly becouse I took a temporary hiatus from my sences. Anyway I need to make a formal request that Thomas stops punching me so hard in the feelings, I just got them fixed man like be gentle with them.
Lmao, Roman and Virgil started from despising each other and not being able to agree to anything to criticizing Thomas for everything and agreeing with most things
why am i crying
i would love to donate to the patron but i cant
This is, without a single solitary doubt, 100% what happens. Right down to the enthusiasm you have when you reach home. Every. Single. Detail. Is. ACCURATE.
just finished re-watching and i can"t get over the ending. (Virgil said the dog was a demon) why is that one of my favorite parts.
Is Thomas trying to kill us with Prinxiety
I don't know how to do gay eyes.    I HAVE A BOYFRIEND HOW CAN'T I DO GAY EYES
me in a nutshell but instead of just gay its trans and pan. also SHIPP
I never get tired of watching this and catching the feels ahggggggg its the same...something non healthy i do is reject myself before even starting a relationship :,D
This was the best animations I’ve ever seen
Does anyone else know why Virgil eyeshadow was switching from purple the black
I love this
Is it just me or does it seem like Virgil and Patton (idk if I spelled those right) like each other even though they are basically the same person?
I have Prinxiety vibes from this clip 19:56 Edit: The ending is perfect
virgils eye shadow changing with each second tho  it means something, i just dont know what yet
“i hate to rain on your *black* parade *gerard gay* “IM SCREAMING
17:12 for all you people out there to watch this great ending 😻👍🏻
i have watched this video too many times lmao
Virgil: You did it again Thomas: Yeah, I gotta stop wooing people in the bathroom
Make more of these animatics
virgil sitting on the counter: *Every Homosexual Ever™*
This episode gave me gay panic attacks
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!
20:05 HAHAJD
19:53 HAAHAAAAGJF
19:30 AHAJDJJSJCDJJC FOR THE 2ND TIM
19:14 LOL 19:24 W o w ..🥺
19:03 🥺
18:06 IMAGINE THE LIEK- LIL ROMANS AND VIRGILS IN HIS HEAD-
17:05 17:12 He sees how sad he is AND DECIDED AHH
Me being a part of the LGTBQ+ (bisexual) I clicked on this In 2 seconds lol
I'm back. Prinxiety nation how we feeling?
VIRGIL BLUSHES AT ROMAN AT EXACTLY 19:55  *shipper noises *   AND THEN ROMAN HAS THE HEARTS FOR VIRGIL AT EXACTLY 19:59  BUT IF U WANT REAL CUTENESS WATCH 19:55 TO 20:00
" I-I was afraid you left.." Virgil: [screech]
*_This is pretty much just how me and my sister treat our mom when she's shopping-_*
e
THIS IS ADORABLE 🥺💖
Now i wonder sanders is gay
Thomas: nothing but a bruised ego  Roman: *visible annoyance* hmm!
God when it comes to Virgil and Roman my stomach goes like :z🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
i just noticed, this video is ESSENTIAL VIEWING FOR THE MAIN SERIES     what does this meeeeeaaannnnnnn
is or are he/you gay?
*Ok, but Virgil is so cute when hes happy my angel child, **_SATANBEGONE-_*
🥰🥰🥰
this was really cute. being part of the LGBTQ+ community, this made my heart happy.
This video needs to be made  I need to see live action Thomas gay panic
I like how a lot of this related to me. Not on the gay side of the story, or on the romantic side because, I mean, high school student, but on the anxiety side. Being so unsure of what to do, that you jerk around until, at least for me, I freeze. So the scenes like the standing up and sitting down scene, as well as the being pushed around the mall by your anxiety really related to me.
WAIT ABDILLUSTRATES IS-????? oh my god
prinxiety fans have entered the chat
GAY EYES
"Shut up emo" but lovingly
Re-watching because I need more gay and happiness in my life... so thanks again for that.
Virgil's Tempest Tongue!!!  24:05  turn on the captions, that's what its called. So cool that we finally have a name (other than demon voice)!!
*gerard gay*
virgil has "happy" under eye darkness that's sparkly. i can't i love it
old virgil: was against almost all of roman's wild ideas new virgil when roman suggests paris: I'm listening
Why is no one talking about the "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay-"?
Friendly reminder for you guys that it’s okay to ship the character of Nico with character Thomas, but please don’t ship the actual actor for Nico with “real life” Thomas, please and thank you.
favourite lines  cutie 12:00 pretty gay he’s gay! that was the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me you saw me knock over that trash can, didn’t you that was you!? list more in the reply part plz
the amount of times i watched this is scary     i love it
That was the cutest thing I ever see omg 😍💕
"He's got some stickers on his laptop" "Pretty gay" Lol I can see my friends having this conversation easily 😆💜🌈
I feel like theres some ship that has risen more towards the part when Roman said “ shut up emo”   I mean that sentence right there has..... something.... I don’t know what it is, but it doos
I didn't except it to be this good thank you
AWWW WHEN ROMAN SAID “shut up emo” I JUST- 🥰 ALSO NOTICE THE HEARTS BY ROMANS HEAD I JUST- I SHIP THEM SM
Its so cute im going to cry u was so cute i cant
Wow this is so cute!
“i duno plant“ is an amazing quote
You used to post sander sides videos every week what happen
I WANT AND NEED MORE OF THESE PLEASEEEE!!!!
Virgil is the definition of gay panic 👌
This was the cutest thing I have ever seen
my respect for u 📉📉📉📉
Never in a single YouTube video have I seen such a moving plot arc
Omg i love this 😂♥️♥️  Its CUTE and funny  and Everything!!   Love from Uruguay!! ♥️🇺🇾
Why am I shipping Roman and Virgil they are literally the same person...
wait so are u gay????
10:46  i dunno,,, plant,,,,,,,,,,
I want a Sander's Sides video about secrets and why we tend to wanna share them, how to keep a secret etc.
Tubbo_ whispers to you: *This is deffo flerting*
boiled male carrots, that's highly suggestive
idk plant
My first date with my ex boyfriend was watching this video, lol.
Patton janus Logan and remus are just eating popcorn silently
WAIT DID PRINCXIETY BECOME CANON HOLD UP-  *THE HEARTSSSSSS*
We don't know if he is not gay....
19:59  There are hearts next to Roman’s face after talking to Virgil  THERE ARE HEARTS NEXT TO ROMAN’S FACE AFTER TALKING TO VIRGIL   ima lose my $h!t
If there is something I’ve learned from watching these video its that you should never go into the comments before you’ve finished the episode
24:05 HOLY CRAP, Virgil had a different sound effect on his voice! It's the same effect that voiceactors put when Virgils mad!                   OK. I know that this comment is a bit late and that that little easter egg isn't important.
When Roman said "I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay" I fucking died
Why does Thomas give me Jim Carry vibes   I probably butchered that spelling omg-
Made me wanna hug you so much ❤️ was so cute honey 😍
Oh Thomas still this faboulos ❤️
this video never fails to make me smile excessively and or breathe heavily due to pure happiness
the change in Virgil's eyeshadow between black and purple depending on how he's feeling is so cool.
i love how virgil's eye shadow changes depending on his mood now!  its such a creative idea!
I LOVE IT :0 Edit: I really want to join but I really can't... I'm sorry
I am crying so bootiful
Is it just me or was there a Magnus archives Easter egg thrown in there? Gerard gay(key). Or I could just be seeing tma everywhere and have a problem 😂
Ahhh this gave me so much anxiety watching thisss ifjfkfkf But I loved ittttt
Why does the other dude that Thomas is talking to look like Henry Emily
Just say “hi, I like your pins. Where did you get them?” I have major social anxiety and even I can come up with that. It’s hard to say once you get there but once you say it it starts a conversation   Ok that was very wholesome
When i heard the word Deceit in this video i knew there was gonna be something about janus, also When rewatching old bloopers and stuff, i noticed that you kept calling joan by They/Them Pronouns, is Joan Nonbinary?
I'd love to see the live adaptation of this, but I can't Patreon...
LIVE ACTION LIVE ACTION LIVE ACTIONNNNNNNN
I love your vines soooooo much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜🧡💛💚🤎💙❤️🧡🤍💛
I loved this video so much that I almost started crying
Waiting for the going to France video
how do you join
It's embarrassing how relatable this is to me (as an introvert)
i love how you made it with his purple side and red side
"shut up emo" lmaoamakkskwksmms
Virgil totally has a crush on roman
Sorry sing
Make a Logan saying
SO DID THEY GO TO FRANCE FOR VALENTINES DAY-
Quick Question: Does Joan use they/them pronouns? I have heard Thomas refer to Joan as they/them. Sorry if this has been answered before
Anxiety sure makes you act out many things involuntary.
Me watching this video: *inhale* YYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS MY GAY FWEND MY PANSEXUALNESS IS HERE
Oh God Thomas is gay
I have watched this sooooo many times I love it
Ok I have one question does anyone else think an other q&a is needed I mean there are more sides now and so much character development has happened.
I am Virgil and he is me, you cannot convince me otherwise
Awwww so cute TT
Hi
I wanna make my emotions characters like you. You inspired me 😅
Theory: Logan and Virgil dont have bad sides like Roman has Remus and Patton Has Janus because Virgil was Logan's bad side overthinking/anixety BAM
This video gave me courage in a way to never let down your one and only opportunity to tell someone that you like them. Because you’ll never know if they’re the one.
When Virgil said Demon at the end of the episode when the dog barked I couldn't help but think of cerberous
Me watching this I 2021 wanting another episode and also having no money so I can't join patreon
*It's been four months and I still freak out about this*
Watching this again and just saying "me" every 5 seconds
I love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC54xe1S7o4
I can't be the only one who wants to know what the finished sentence in the intro was😅
I love this so much
I am not going to lie the gay eyes remind me of Luz and Amity
16:08 Gay Panic Be Like
Why Do I Love This So Much !!!??? This Is So Cute And I'm So Glad This Is A Thing, Thankyou Thomas Sanders !!
🤦🏻‍♀️
Hi, I just found this. Subscribed and became addicted when i heard,  "no, there are PINS and BUTTONS on his backpack" "*gaaasp* OOh more clues!"   Awwe- Its so cute! My heart ;w;
OH COME ON PLZZZZZZ TELL ME THAT VIRGIL AND ROMEN ARE A COPLE OR AT LEST LIKE EACH OTHER
Ok but is Thomas Sanders actually gay? Uhh... Asking... For a friend...?
Prinxiety must be cannon by now—
Can someone help me make gay eyes?
Thomas its been almost 4 months  Where's the next episode 😔
16:55
IF ANYBODY NEEDS A FRIEND, I AM RIGHT HERE!❤️💙💛💚💜
*sniffles* this.. is the most amazing story I've heard.. Thomas sanders, you made my day with this story
ive been watching anime all day and now im onto sanders sides and let me tell you the fangirling never ends with either of those things
*prinxiety shippers have entered the chat*
I really want to make a Patreon to subscribe to Thomas as a gift for a friend so we can share it. He loves Thomas and really needs the pick me up. Heck, I need it too.
So, first of all, this episode made me realize that I stim, which was a...very weird realization for me. Second of all, I litteraly cannot watch this video without melting to a puddle on the floor and screeching so loud the neighbours complain (yes I am a prinxiety shipper why do you ask? But like...the shoulder touch, Virgil pushing Thomas and defying his purpouse of existence just for Roman (and Thomas ofc, but mainly Roman)? If someone did that for me I would die, the boys make me soft). And third of all, have I mentioned that I kin Virgil? Seriously, he is my spirit animal and I love him. I litteraly got a whole new music taste because of him and just...Virgil, my boiii. Anyways, hope you guys (and fellow gays) have a good day, luv y'all, enjoy this masterpiece.  (If you wanna come and scream about Prinxiety with me, I have a Tumblr...@eeriefeelingsat3amuwu)
I love how at the end Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing depending on his mood!  Shimmer/lighter when he was happy/giddy and black for when he was anxious.  It was such a nice touch.
Dear Thomas Sanders,  I’m very happy to have found your YouTube channel. I absolutely love 💙💙💜❤️💛💚 everything you do with the Sanders Sides and I love 💗 your vines. Each of your sides brings a smile to my face and help me to discover more about myself. I absolutely love 💗 Roman, Virgil, Logan and Patton. Keep on making more amazing 🤩 videos!! You’re such an amazing person and a very creative person!!   Thank you so much for everything you’ve ever posted or done!, Jacqueline Banuelos
This is cute though honestly, and Thomas’ speech in the mirror was amazing
6:51 this is a reference to that song “creep” right?
SHUT UP EMO AKSVSKSVSDKSCK 🥺
Man I want to see this in real life
Thomas: this will be important for the story line Prinxiety shippers: *screaming as they all start drawing fan fiction about Virgil and Roman dating and theorizing if this is how Thomas is about to tell everyone that Roman is dating Virgil
This one THIS ONE is THE ONLY ONE OF THE SANDER SIDES THAT MAKES ME LAUGH NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I watch it
At the beginning: beep beep In the middle: Beep Beep Beep  at the end: BEEPBEEPBEEP!!!!
“I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay”    OMFG AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT THIS REFERENCE?!!!!????  Guys, this is the mcr fandom. My. Chemical. Romance.
Hello, been subscribed for a bit, but not very informed. Was this fully a skit or did Thomas actually get himself a man!? Someone please tell me!
Don't mind me I'm just dying from how adorable this is
Is it just me or when virgils happy or excited he has purple eyeshadow instead of black UwU Also the prinxietyyyyyyyy
This episode is the definition of gay panic🏳️‍🌈
*_23:15_**_ _**_24:00_**_- Did anyone else notice that when Virgil got a little anxious again his eye shadow went back to dark? He's all happy now, so he's a purple boyyy💜💜💜💜_*
I started crying halfway through... *_WHY CANT THIS HAPPEN TO MEEEEEEEE-IS THIS WHAT SOCIAL INTERACTION IS LIKE, WHY DOES IT WORK LIKE THAT, HOW CAN I MAKE THAT HAPPEN, I WANT ITTTTT-_*
the funny thing is Thomas is probably talking to him self  and everyone thinks he's crazy
Anyone noticed Logan and Patton's influence in the ending?  Logan speaking through Thomas, telling them all to be calm and realistic and not expect too much right away Patton speaking through Thomas, questioning if they're actually ready for this.
"You're a creep. You're a weirdo. What the hell are we doing here?" *Impeccable reference, Sanders.*
2 love stories in one
AWWWWWWWW
“I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay” 😂
OMG SO CUTE! I CANT!
that was literally the cutest gay animatic i have ever seen ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗💗💗💗will there be more OwO
Is anyone else slightly concerned about how lenient you are on yourself for lying? I don't see any problem with those types of lies. Like, you're not gonna tell a stranger that you were practicing to talk up a guy that you like, what if they're homophobic? and as for all the little lies about not wanting food, not seeing the text, that's just basic day to day lies. there are no actual ramifications for lying to strangers, and even *if* they find out you lied, so what? you're never gonna see them again!
I started crying towards the end...
i’ve never wanted to have money more than now so i could be a patron
What are the 820 f88king dislikes on this vid wtf
This episode gave me a free rollercoaster ticket to the emotional rollercoaster then pushed me on and buckled me in dang
the "SHUT UP"s are the most relatable thing i've seen in a year
IS THIS TRUE? IS THIS TRUE?
It's beautiful.
Ok....the thumbnail    I'm in the middle :)
Is there a bad side to logic?
I just noticed the Sides have different voices   edit: i din’t understand what Deceit has to do with this. If someone could explain, that would be great
Virgil's eyeshadow turned purple when he was happy. That's so cute
Thomas is always so energetic! I caaaaan'tttt
the prinxiety shippers: what to watch..... *GASP* i know **holds this video that they watch millions of times ** AHHHH THIS MASTERPIECE YES [this is me}
Ship has been spotted. I repeat, a ship has been spotted.
I love this video very cute alot of people can relate 😅 (me included )
I feel this video its like so ture   Also I love that princey said "pin"trovert   Also Roman and Virgils gay panic 😂😂(same)
"Shut up emo" true love right there :)
Uhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, i may be over thinking this but did you saw virgils face when roman said "if he's ready, we are ready" (23:58), that look of confusion and maybe...fear?. (24:00) yeah, he's anxiety he worrys about anything, but after waching it fot the third time i just wonder...  is Virgil ready?  but ignore me i'm just rambling pointless things over here
"You can live like Jack and Sally if you want." I get that song reference and that both excites and horrifies me. Mayhaps baby goth me was more emo than I like to admit. <_<  This entire animation was so freaking precious I love it to pieces!
Roman: You're going to have to try speaking from the heart Ad: I'm a big kid now!
Me: Mom I swear it's educational! My mom: Okay, what did you learn? Me: How to speak introvert
10:09  GERARD GAY PPPPFFFT-
Why are you not wearing a mask?
PRINXIETY HEHEHEHHE (This was super cute and wholesome great job!)
I see you you're walking cross the campus, cruel professor, studying romances- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PRETEND I NEVER WANNA SEE YOI AGAIN?- Ahem.  But I'm just like, SCREAMING because it's just, as soon as he saw Roman was sad Virgil was like "ohnoohno" and it just made me melt because it was like he didn't wanna let his own crush down so he did something to make him h a p p y and I- HUUUUU THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WITH THIS DAMNIT. I can't put my thoughts into the poetic words they are in my head so I just sound like I'm spazzing please tell me y'all understand   P. S- Low-key kept seeing them as Lance and Keith
I really think Thomas is secretly a repressed emo
Wonderful video! Okay, I CANNOT get over Vergil’s purple eye bags/eyeshadow at the end. I have been thinking about it for *literal days*. For some reason, it just resonates so much with me. The way it perfectly conveys That FeelingTM, being so high emotionally you feel nothing can go wrong, and also the way it so perfectly flickers slowly back to black as worry sets in. And the shade is so breathtaking!!! (I love purple). I was nervous in class today, but I just kept picturing Vergil’s purple eyeshadow I and I felt like I could do anything 💗
Why is this so cute
THIS IS ADORABLE> HOW AM I ONLY SEEING THIS NOW?????
Oh my god new eye shadow and I love it.
Why is this me when I see a cute boy or girl?
You know what this has alot of princxicty
I love this so much its so good. I want part 2
"Shut up emo"
Can I cry please? Imma cry because of how beautiful this is.
LGBTQ+ PRIDE
Did this actually happen
Me not even finished watching the video: pleeeaaaassseeee tell me they end up dating! 🥺 Edit: MY SHIPS. NOW MARRY YOUR SOULMATE THOMAS!!!
I think that virgil isnt actually anxiety
EEEEEEEEEEEE!
11:13 Joan?? 👀
is it just me or did anyone else cried😖
ITS SO CUTE OMIGOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Virgil: * sees Roman sad* Also Virgil: * gets gay panic then pushes Thomas* Me: *SnIfF* his love is more effective for Roman! Edit:whole heck where’d all u come from!
I'm watch this for the 2 time and i still almost cried it is so cute. Especially at the end that was adorable!!!!
I NEED MORE
* Sees Roman touching Virgil's shoulder*  *STARTS UNHOLY GAY SCREECHING*
Where is janus going to have a song? Like am I the only one
Dude like why is this me tho like ugh I fell you Thomas
R.i.p. to bathroom man ;-; U_U It's ok man you'll find that someone, whether that's in another bathroom stall or somewhere more hygienic I believe in you cutie 😌✊  Also I'm very proud of myself for re-watching this and this time around being able to keep my social anxiety down as well as possible and just ultimately happily arrive at the beautiful ending while enjoying the jokes UwU :'3 💕
"Shut up emo"
Omg I love this my ship sailed and I can’t s top SMIIIILLLLIIIIINNNNGGGGGGG
I have marathon all your videos and watched a few a few more times. I love your sense of humour. Just wanted to say I appreciate your art.
Making up lies on the spot when something akward happens doesnt make u a bad person lmao
First of all Virgil and Roman should date and second did he get with the guy?????
So I had to skip through alot of this because of some mental issues, but from what I was able to watch this video was amazing! Good job Thomas and others who worked to create this!
dear Thomas sanders,  i was wondering if the sides have any influence on the real world because in several episodes they have bin shown to be able to hang up clothing hand you a binder and conger live things like puppies and actors. also Remus eats deodorant which I think was real and i this episode Virgil pushes you proving that they can at lest move you.
"I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay" I LOST IT
HDKSHDJSJDHAKHX I JUST SAW THE END DUDE IM- YES, I SCREAMED
Roman: Gay eyes? Thomas: Gay eyes. Virgil: ... Virgil: What are gay eyes?
Dude I just realized In the valentines episode, Patton suggested speaking from the heart. Then in this episode, Roman suggested the same thing. Reference to past video???
6:51 DID HE LOOK UP AT THOMAS FOR A SECOND?!??!?!! EDIT: THEY FUCKING MADE EYE CONTACT IM
“You’re making a mistake!”  “If I am, I’ll add it to the list!”  THATS SO HEARTBREAKING ROMAN NO HOW DID I NOT NOTICE THIS
Isn't gay panic the best?
guys that guy could problably see out of the corner of his eye thomas haveing an argument with himself and then stareding at his laptop and continueing the conversation.
WHY does No one talk about how papoular Thomas is on Tumblr? I mean really . There are sooooooo many people on there who know who he is ITS CRAZY . WHY DOES NO ONE TALK ABOUT THIS
This video makes it so clear how MUCH Virgil and Roman hate Janus
This just made me ship them even more
Something I noticed is virgils eyeshadow is purple when he’s super exited and when he’s getting anxious it goes back to black
HAPPY GLITTER VIRGIL HAPPY GLITTER VIRGIL
*Prinxiety shipper screaming*
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Didn't you want to be a cartoon in an older video?
GOD I relate way too much to this entire episode lmaoooo
Who else can’t get over the fact that Thomas is in his 30’s!!!! He doesn’t seem 30 he still looks and acts like he is in his mid 20’s
"Good Point guys! I don't want me to be doing this either," is basically what I say to my brain everyday when I do something that just reminds everyone that I'm a natural blonde.
I think a video idea you should make is reality vs fantasy cause I’d love to see Roman and Virgil basically have a tag team on why fantasy is better while Patton and Logan say why reality is better. Cause for me I’m hating myself and how reality decides to treat me like complete trash and how no matter how hard I want to do things or start things they always get broken right in my face.it’s a pity that the people who try to do something get the crappy end of the stick. Can’t life just let me feel happy for once or do I only deserve to be a miserable loser that has to live with the thought that no matter what I do it will never go my way.
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
6:30 five microphones. Five.
Oh look...S A L T 🧂
I can't believe Thomas saw the love of his life at an undisclosed burger joint
yo whens the next sander sides vid..
"YEAH! join me, NO THINKING" literally nothing ever will top this quote
When Virgil is happy/positive he has purple eyeshadow !!
Am I the only shipping Virgil with Janus ? Please tell me I am not the only one ;-;
This is so cute and amazing. I love it so much.
legit squeed a few times during this video *has all the feels*
Wait..... am I the only one that realized that he spelled Sides with an A at the beginning? Asides?
:O/ what?
Virgils eyeshadow changing at the end signifying his character development and change in his anxiousness levels of anxiety embodiment
“Let’s not waste this one” Roman: “shut up” Virgil :”shut up” Me : *flustered* “SHUT UP”
My anxiety is so bad I got second hand embarrassment and now I’m hiding in the comment to avoid over projecting myself in that anxious state
Omg I screamed shut up with them at the end without noticed cuz I was so excited
“I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay” This had me laughing for a solid 5 minutes
I was on the verge of tears this is so adorable ^///^
ok side-rant, but anyone who saw the add for PuLl UpS nEw LeAf, it is just somethin' that adds like these promote the idea that **ahem** ...*these adds promote kids to hang out with bears!* like wth! also this vid was awesome! so cuuute!
7:58 this is my brain every time my friend goes “oh hey let’s talk to this person” Dog barks “AHH DEMON” Me when I’m around my dog (Cat mode activated) Jumps on top of the kitchen table XDXD
i havent watched thomas sanders since vine and hes gay now??
Oh ho! Do you hear that... it's the wild call of...       *The shippers* ...
Thomas stimming at the end though 🥰
HAS ANYONE NOTICED THE TITLE SAYS ‘SANDER ASIDES’ ?!
9:48 I have done this 👏SO 👏MANY 👏TIMES
Oh yes   A classic gay love story   (｀・ω・´)
How did I not see this video when it first came out? I LOVE the pre-romance!
I litteely just looked up Sanders name to see what he is up too and he is still funny as ever
Love your videos you help me feel more comfortable with my Sexuality and gender.
omg i was watching this and squealed like so loud and my parents were like what?
I know this comment is late, but I have watched this video many times on other accounts and each time it made me smile.
19:29 - *screams and bursts into tears* “iM SO gAy”
This is just “is he gay or European “in a diffrent font xD
GERARD GAY WHYYY
heh I watched this when it first came out and decided not to comment, look where we're at now. All I came back for was this: As a lesbian- *I felt that*
THE PURPLE GLITTER EYESHADOW OH.MY.GOD I LOVE YOU VIRGIL
Roman: 15:27 Roceit stans: :0
16:08  Me: BAAAAHHAHAHAHA 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Oh I just love this 💖💕🏳️‍🌈
MY ARMS HURT FROM HAND-FLAPPING SO MUCH
3:54 *That’s deceits music*
*clears throat* DIDEVERYONESEETHESHIPMOMENTS
You are special. You are loved.
Virgil x. Roman
Shut up emo I-
These drawings are just so amazing-
Virgil, a side who was treated as worthless and evil most of his existence, being so blatantly hateful against the other dark sides seems SO out of character. Maybe it's just me but it makes it hard to even watch lol
"Cutie at 12 o'clock"  *Pretty boy*
he is still the best
WAIT CAN THE GUY SEE THE SIDES? HE ASKED ABOUT "THEM!" OH MY GOD!
I love how expressive his voice is. I can tell exactly what each character is thinking  when he says things 💖
I love this video and I totally understand.
NOT THE BLACK PARADE 🤣
I CAN'T EVEN WITH THOMAS AND HIS FEELINGS I LOVE IT
Saykkuno and Tomas would be pretty good friends
The gay panic at the end tho
I'm crying
3:33
THAT WAS SO CUTE WTF YESS
Now all we need is a version of this with Patton and Logan about conflictive thoughts when his friend asks him to help him cheat 😱🤩 Ps: if I was writing the episode I would totally find a way to slip logicality into it
24:00 *me when my mom calls me downstairs*
This video is amazing but it sets off my anxiety :C
Doesn't niko kinda sound like Lee
ok but who saw the hints of prinxiety- Did everyone else see that or am i just a hopeless shipper???     A l s o - Thomas- I know ur prob not gon see dis but like- u changed my life so much 0_0
4:16
“This video is essential for the overall storyline.” Me: Wait, there’s an actual storyline?
Prinxiety in one video:
Then you need a kissing scene
The amount of pricxiety  moments
(16:21) OMG I WAS LIKE ‘OMG THATS SO AWKWARD’ SO MANY TIMES DURING THIS AND AAHHHHHHHHH  I love this tho
Flirting with social anxiety  Flirting with yourself like kissing urself
YOUR GAY
this is the best thing I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I see many great, great, amazing things, but this was the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Legend says that if you listen closely, you can still hear the Prinxiety shippers unholy screeching
I will never not love this episode
WAIT IMAGINE THE SIDES REALIZING THAT JANUS HELPS THOMAS ACT   ACTING IS LYING, BUT ROMAN TAKES CREDIT FOR THE ACTING   EVEN THOUGH ITS JANUS         AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Not gonna lie This made me cry T-T  Edit: I love this video is so cute....TUT
Super cute
Mcr reference gerard gay XD for all those ferard shippers yall get it uwu
imagnie fearing love while defying and lying about logic  (roman, virgil, patton, remus, deceit, logan if ya didn't get that)
10:07
"gerard gay" absolutely killed me
"HE FEARS THINGS TOO!?" Absolute mood, Virgil.
:D more Virgil!  Insomnia buddy'sssss
Can u do sander aside turn into kids?-
this is cute
I DONNO!! PLANTS!! 💀💀and yes all of this is very me 😩
Oh, so this is "Sander Sides"? more like Wholesome Sides.
Me:*makes wierdddddd noises* ankhsihd aksb sohdsnod
The last thing i did before turning 13 was watch a man in his 30’s rant in the bathroom trying to get another unsuspected victim to become his love interest
....IS Virgil ready though?
Hey Thomas, I don't know if it's going to be the same for you, but it gets easier to ask people out the more you do it. Please don't be sad bro, you did good.
I'm wondering if this is how it actually happened.
This was adorable
I only need to know one thing, why did Roman scream liar when they were in the bathroom stall? What was the lie on the toilet?!??!?
ISTG VIRGIL LIKES ROMAN
That was SOOOO CUTE!!
Sorry to ask- but does anyone know what app they used to animate this?
Me:starting to question if prinxitey is real
17:05  For all the Prinxiety shippers: Virgil pushed Thomas after he saw Roman was sad, here you go
Cute
Thomas stimming at the end is making me so happy
This made me anxious
Thomas I love your work so much and this episode is amazing. You have such an accepting, fun and loving personality that I cherish. I have a question but there’s no pressure to answer. Are any of the Sanders sides ships canon? I personally ship Prinxiety and Logicality and the end of this episode makes me wonder if Prinxiety is canon. At the start of the video, you mentioned that this was essential for the story line and I was wondering if that meant that Virgil was developing feelings for Roman vis versa or if it meant we would see more of the guy you were crushing on throughout the video. Finally, I saw a comment in regards to Virgils purple eyeshadow which hypothesised that when Virgil is anxious, his eyeshadow is black and when he’s feeling calm (or possibly gay panicking at Roman) his eyeshadow is purple. I love the purple eyeshadow and feel it suits Virgil. Sorry for the long comment, I know it’s late but if you see this (which I doubt you will) could you please say if there are any cannon ships? You don’t have to say which ones they are. I love you and your content so much, keep up the good work 😋
omfg the stimming at the end made me start happy flapping too i love this so much
I can relate to this episode so much because im bi
This is so cute I love it so much
I just realized that when we didn't know what Nico's name was in the subtitles "cute stranger"... I can feel the gay pouring out of me.
Aaaaahhhh I love this
Hey! You are the reason I am out of closet! (I'm non-binary and gay) (and on Monday I'm going to probably piss off one of my uncles because they're homophobic and I'm leaving my pride flag up)
ENEMIES TO LOVEEEERRRRS TROOOOOOPPPEEE 😲😲😲🥴🤪  (Roman+Virgil)
ABC if you came out LGBTQ+ just like Thomas
This is adorable! I can't wait until the real life version comes out!❤
One time I had a mental conversation with myself that went like My brain: Don’t leave that on the table, someone might steal it Me: Who. Who would steal it. My brain: Remember that article about porch pirates? Me: Porch pirates... inside the house. My brain: Yeah. Me: So... robbers then.  And I made it into an incorrect quote for Virgil so I’m glad to see that it was very accurate.
Am I the only one that: a) is extremely happy and excited to see Virgil being excited and happy at the end of the episode? Like... He was smiling and hopeful and excited. My heart. Just. Ah!!! b) To see this change in Virgil represented by the different color of his eyeshadow? Like, Virgil has now a light side that is represented by the purple eyeshadow?  How amazing is that????
Why am i so late- *flashbacks of trying to draw virgil x roman picture* thats why...
*Uggh Pintroverts*
Signing up for Roman's soon!
The confession? As someone who misjudges social ettiquete so much, my autistic posterior melted at that. I need a pin backpack.
5:35  Roman: more clues! (Saying that while being a happy bean)  (I just can’t with this he’s so adorable I love it)
I also didn’t know you still made these
I’m pretty sure all of the social anxiety is virgils fault
Let’s not forget that he does perfect makeup-
Why were only Virgil and Roman there? Shouldn't Patton have been around since this concerned matters of the heart? And maybe Deceit too, given how much V and Roman kept calling Thomas a liar.
GERAD GAY BAHAHAHA
That was pretty pog
nOoNe Is SpEaKiNg AbOuT tHe ZoOm iN oN vIrGiL aT tHe EnD 24:02
Anyone else notice that Virgil’s eyeshadow changed? Multiple times? Intriguing!
So looking forward to more videos  🌈
14:23 XD lmao
"Gerard Gay" thank you.
Roman was so unbelievably adorable in this XD
THIS DOESN'T HELP MY PRINCANXTIEY
I relate to Virgil on a personal level due to my friends calling me the living embodiment of anxiety 😂
6:36 This should happen more often
This fr how it feels to be gay and i 😭 man, couldn't have put it better tbh
I'm not crying ur crying
6:50 Nice reference
16:08 GAY PANIC GAY PANIC AAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAHHH
This shippers and his eyeshadow is not what's important nothing is important the entire episode except         Did he really watch the movie in the beginning of the episode???
Don't mind me. Just gonna go cry over there...
BRUH SHUT UP EMO IM GONNA CRY
jsdjhd i thought the title meant like.. someone flirting with virgil lmao
I’ve been meaning to watch this since it came out but I didn’t until now. I love it!
I’m just now realizing that everyone thought that the orange side would be introduced in this episode or something and Thomas was just like GAY TIME😂
Random but Patton isn’t gay he’s pan change my mind
This makes my heart so happy
am i high or does this dude look kinda like elon musk
i check this way to often to see when the next one will come out lol
I'm actually CrYIng right now...😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
6:50 the radio head reference. Nice touch
I rewatched this-
gay screaming 22:35
virgil just sitting on a sink like: o-o
'speaking from the heart' ok who has patton's number
Aw virgil's eyeshadow kept turning pink and shiny it was so cute.
Plss do more that one was to cute I almost cried
Mmmmmmmmm why nobody talking about how in the beginning people kept telling Thomas to “relax” when anxiety was kicking in and then at the end Virgil lashed out at Logan for telling him to relax too hehdhdhdh
16:20  Roman is literally the gay in me completely ignoring the straight in me-
WHY DID SANDERS SIDES STOP
MY HEART!! this makes me a little more ok with myself, thank you ur amazing!
Heh, funny, he thinks he’ll be able to go to France. Covid says no.
IM SCREAMING OMFG AAAAAAAH PRINXIETY OMG PLEASE THOMAS PLEASE MAKE THIS SHIP CANON US FANDERS ARE DYING!!! Also please tell me this happened irl?
Is he actually gay?
Hey Thomas Sanders would you like to explain why Logan is in my hero Academia as  tenya
Guys, pause at 21:32 - 21:33 *Janus' left hand is human* this is the joke I know it was behind the scenes
Why no Logan and patton?
He always knows steeven universe voice actors right well stevens voice actor is form just add magic actor Chuck  and mama p well fro  kung fu panda
Thomas are you gay
My heart!!!😍😍😍
20:22  THE WAY HE PUTS ON JANUS'S HAT- JAKDJKFJFJ
17:14  ... *Was he having a panic attack?* ;-;
If you wanna get..  *Ruff?*
I cry every time I watch this
Own, dramatic but owwwwn
Damn it Thomes now I'm crying! Thx so much!
They have finely released or ship
THIS. I don't think you understand....     Every time I watch an animated film I BEG that it's proud, funny, akward and relatable. You have no idea what you just did. Respect ✌.
My best friends gay dad has a crush on u
*Virgil has entered the arena* * Virgil has left the arena and went to die under a bridge*
10:46 idk.. plant 🌱         I feel this and it’s so cute 🥺❤️
What is the music called that was at 0:26?
Hey this is awesome         BuT DiD YoU KnOw ThAt  LiKe A gOoD nEiGhBoR StAtEfArMe iS ThErE
I swear- this series has given so many hints- I feel like Virgil and Roman will end up together! :D
gay eyes is the incorrect term Thomas... ITS COMUNIGAYTION
19:40 gae panic
THE  PANEL AT 16:57 IS SO HILARIOUSS GJKNHAKMJOi
This is way too accurate and I hate it, thanks for making this 🤣
This made me cry
Heh
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS HE LOOKS LIKE MATURE JOEY
Did anyone see virgil's eyeshadow just changes when he's excited
exCITED  VIRGIL IM GRINNING SO HARD IT HURTS
Wait, Thomas is gay? never knew that....
22:20 I'm loving his eyeshadow-
THIS IS THE CUTEST I CANT-
But wasn’t Roman sad/Smad (sad and angry) at Thomas last sander sides vid?
You should make them react to it
Why is this me with anxiety? WhY does this describe me exactly
I know this has nothing to do with the video, but can Talyn pleeeaaaase do a gothic style makeup tutorial? Their sense of style is amaaaaazing
Roman: what the heck was that?! Thomas: dont look at me! Virgil: no *do* look at yourself Thomas. Because that was a test *and you failed* Thomas: YOU WERE TESTING ME! Virgil: oh no, I wasn’t testing you. I was just panicking. No the *universe* tested you, and you chose to be a liar!        *I LOVED THAT*
*I HAVE SEEN FAR TO MANT ‘PRINXIETY’ COMMENTS. I FEEL LEFT OUT AND IDK WUT PRINXIETY IS D:*
Roman: introvert  Virgil: extrovert  Thomas: *is confusing*
this was so good i legit cried i— BYE DJKDIF FC
Please god let this true
This is so cute I'm actually crying like what-
What about Remus and Janus
When the intro said virgil I thought it said  virgin- so,, in conclusion virginity causes anxiety.
I hate how god damned relatable this video is. Noooo, it’s just all gay panic. This is why I always wear a pride bracelet
I was greatly disturbed when Virgil went into the room in the end card because I have never seen him with *light* eyeshadow and whenever it changed I was disturbed
Imagine this being uploaded on your birthday...
I'm never alone when I'm alone lol
Every time I watch this I start shaking, I love it so so so so so so much
Hey, I'm probably being stupid, but Nico Flores is a fictional character made for this storyline, correct?
Y'all I already know I commented 2 other times but YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT THOMAS AND THE DUDE IN THE BATHROOM DON'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD FIT 😑😑😑LIKE SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:12 they have 5 microphones???
WHEN DOES THE LIVE ACTION VERSION COME OUT?! I NEED IT!
idk plant...
I'm straight but this was me trying to tp get the attention of my crush. He found out quickly how awkward and weird I am. Now he likes me back 😂
Sooooooooooooooo everyone gonna ignore princey and virge finally got along?
Is it just me or did you guys see the HEART when Roman touched Virgil’s shoulder
ggtgt
I wonder if the Orange Side will be Shame and named Aidos? "... that doesn't end in an A N or O N" ~Patton Dark Sides so far end in U S, what if the other one ends in O S?
Me waiting for them to kiss:👁👄👁 Me after the video: WHY DIDN'T THEY KISS AGGFKGJVYLBFU
Has anyone noticed that Logan and iida (from bnha) are very similar... Just me okay
Cutie at 12 a clock
The most adorable thing ever
Virgil: He's got some stickers on his laptop Roman: That's pretty gay Me: *Subconsciously looks to the stickers on the top and just below the keyboard of my laptop* Just because I'm gay doesn't mean that's true, it's also introvert language Virgil: It's an introvert thing Me: Did you read my mind Virgil!?
Also "He's gay. Great." "Great indeed" "GREAT INDEED" "NEXT COSTUMER!!!!!!!!" "Oh uhhh I'll have the uhhhh. . . . . boiled mayo carrots. . . O GAWD!!!!!"
Why can't the creatiety ship be me and someone I REALLY like also the microphone part😂😂😂
Who else laughed when Roman said “easy tiger” to Virgil?
Was the voice of the stranger Jone
this is incredibly random, but what i would do to see remus sing ‘hard to be the bard’ is stupid
this is so amzingggg
Thomas you made me cry at 2 in the morning 😭(very cute tho)
Is Thomas a gay !!😑
I can still hear the shrieks of Prinxiety shippers two months later
Who else noticed that Thomas is watching a rated r+ movie called "Single"
Whoever disliked this is either homophobic or stupid UwU
ive had this open in a tab since it came out and rewatch it whenever i can, yes i have a problem mom but at least im not an alchoholic ok now shut up and let me watch the gay animatic
XD this video was amazing, 10/10 owo
Cute
We need my chemical romance in 2020-
I’m so sad I don’t have enough money for patreon 😭😭😭
Hmmm Virgil with black eyeshadow is anxiety but with purple eyeshadow he is in layman terms- "over excited" or a hyperarousal mental state that can be positive but is just as difficult to control as overwhelming anxiety and panic. I like this representation.
You know this is your favorite episode when you can’t stop watching over and over after like 2-3 months after it came out.
11 out of 10
This made me smile so much at the end, but of course the “shut up emo” was the best part.
I feel so bad for the guy in the bathroom.. LOL
10:34 Virgil: Your making a mistake! Roman: If I am, I'll add it to the list!  Don't know if someone already commented this, but can we talk about the words Roman says here? Like, Roman, buddy, this is more of something Virgil would say.
Well- this is gay lol
Roman: your just going to have to..... Speack from the heart.  Me: wait. Back from the early days. In the asking out episode, he thomas remembered that line. This is forshodowing at it's finest.   Also the character building of roman since then. Just, wow. He's more than just "prince" now. He felt anxious. Virgil noticed it. I noticed it. We all noticed it. This is why thomas is so good at world build
Roman: so you know what we do now? Virgil: go home and regret everything. Roman: how about I just regret asking you that question
I felt this deep in my soul 😂
plz make more pokemon pranks
Ar you gai
Omg the gay look- evrytime in the bus and I know it never works but still do it?!
Did Virgil have an anxiety attack?  17:16
Ahem I love the fact how it has some of ✨prinxciety✨ with a lil bit of Thomas sanders being ✨gay✨         E
Me just rewatching this for the 10th time because it’s adorable
this is recorded with a VR camera.  YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT HE ISN'T JUST CROPPING IT AT ANY GIVEN TIME
Yep hes a bottom
Video : Flirting with social anxiety  Other's people mind : Anxiety while flirting  Me : People flirting with virgil Also me seeing the end : *Indeed*
This makes me feel so much anxiety myself
Panic, I have this thing where I can feel others embarrassment.  Doesn't take it away from them tho.
ok I legit love virgils purple eyeshadow!
wow, 5 years ago I started watching your channel as a straight, now i am gay xd love you!!
19:53 This is the BEST THING EVER!!!!!
This was great
WOW 30's you look sooo young
Virgil: He fears things too !!! 😱  Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t know how to ask you this Tomas but do you have a boyfriend? Sorry I shouldn’t ask I’m just curious!
Honestly, I want to see someone like Patton try to hug Janus and him just being like, "What are you- don't touch me!'
I love how it’s not just Virgil that drives specifically Social Anxiety. You need Creativity to come up with all the terrible little things that could possibly happen.
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW THO 💜
That was so cute🥺
Pls tell me this happened and he is with them
Ahhhhhhhh so cute am dead
Roman: sigh, cutie at twelve o clock XD 😂
Soooooooo cute
MY GAY HEART- CALL AN AMBULANCE 😭🏳️‍🌈✨
Is thomas gay???
🥔
Thomas’s monologue in the bathroom is a declaration of love to rival kaworu and Simon.
I have anxiety right now or that’s just fear because my friend that I thought hated me because reasons just texted me and I’m freaking out!
You should be one if those rubber necklaces that you chew on for Virg.
19:51 Well now we know virgil might actually be able to fit into Gryffindor! 😂
When you realize Kentucky guy and Thomas Sanders are related.  " wait what now?!?!"
This is so cute!
Side note: I could not watch this the hour it was released because-well reasons of course. THREE MONTHS LATER I finally get to see this! It was awesome, funny and it had some touching parts. Well done :)
At last! the perfect label exists: Pintrovert. How exellent and accurate!!
Omg I understand this so well omg!!
4:25   HES  GAY WHY DIDNT POEOPlE TELL ME  okay i ship him with that dude😋
Yu-Gi-Oh!!!!!!!! 7:23 sorry I love Yu-Gi-Oh! Lol
*Sniff *Sniff* so buetiful
I know this isn't really important, but I just wanna say this. Sanders Sides actually helped me overcome internalized homophobia, which lead me to discover I was LGBTQ. I might not be the way I am today without it, so I'm so grateful to have this series <3
I really love the animation and the and makeup in the end especially the when Virgils eye shadow kept changing from purple to black I think I changes purple because he is either happy or excited and or a full light side compared to when he has the black eyeshadow which is more or less a hint of dark side left but IDK it’s just a hunch🤪
*sad cause i really wanna get on patreon but cant cause im super broke*
Wait I just returned and Thomas is gay or is it just a part of the bit?(I'm not a hater of gays and I fully support them)
Thomas should watch Ouran High School Host Club.. Tamaki and Roman would relate on a spiritual level.
The first 24 min long vid I fully watched without any regrets-(╥﹏╥)  *C U T E* _sniff sniff_
Thanks for all the fun and learning, I'm still severely mental health but now dad jokes don't scare me.
Virgil: HE FEARS THINGS TOO??  *yea mate, that’s kinda what happens...*
You’re singing voice is Beautiful
I just came out as bi and they accept me the only thing I am keeping secret is that I am dating a girl....(btw I am a girl)
19:50  *sniff sniff* I smell a ship.
Everyone's noticing the MCR reference but not the Blink one :'c
I had to stop for a minute because I couldn't get over the Paramore joke. "For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic," Gotta say, that song slaps, though.
I loved this!! Virgil and romen great job!!
My friend wanted me to watch  this and i did and i love this now
I especially missed Logan though. Where is he? I feel like he was getting the spot light less.. but it can be just me, I don't know. I don't know, I don't know I just miss everyone too much 🥰❤️😍
Thomas, I missed everyone. I missed you. This has been a tough week. This was amazing.
Thomas
Me being a awkward mess trying to talk to my crush be like:
AGGGGHBHHHH IM TWO MONTHS LATE BUT PRINXIETY IS MAKING ME SCREAMMM IS THIS INTENTIONAL THOMAS?!?!??!  AHHHHHHH AND THE HEARTS AT THE ENDDDD
When Roman actually cared for Virgil and told him to calm down I replayed it like 60 times
Thank you sm for this story my gay ass really needed this. The only flirting tactic I’ve mastered is not confronting the person I’m attracted to and hoping they come up to me. It has never worked. Literally. So this is a start.
"What are you doing?" "I dunno... plAant :(" Makes me laugh every time  Putting this here so I can listen to it again: 10:43
Anyone else sometimes imagine your own [Your last name here] Sides? I do occasionally when I'm bored lol
This makes my tiny gay Brian SO HAPPY! AHHHHH
virgil: *pushes Thomas* me, in my living room: *whispers* yay! fight or flight!
Wait wait wait... he said this was important to the story of Sanders Sides, DOES THIS MEAN HE FINALLY HAS A BOYFRIEND?!?!?! :OOOOOO  If so... YAY!!!!!
9:55 *"Yep, it's mah leaving time"* makes me laugh so hard- it's also like, it describes my life-
Ok, so I was out with my dad and I saw this REALLY cute girl. She looked about two or three years older than me, and I can't find her. She most likely lives in my neighborhood though.
ah, the struggle. "is he gay?" or she, if your me
THE HOGWARTS SET IN THE BACKGROUND THOOOO I WANT IT SO BAD
The new Virgil eyeshadow- I am shook😆😘
19:56 did i just see little hearts by princey? i believe i did! PRINXIETY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can’t wait for the next one
I feel like if anyone ever told me to play along, i would act like they were my best friend for years
Hehehehehehehe
I was saying (after I saw you did) it was cuz you didn’t have your coffee so you didn’t remember the cup
*PLEASE*   give more backstory to virgil! YOU LEFT WITH "Because I used to be one of them." In Intrusive Thoughts AND LEFT IT!
Remembers when you forgot your coffee cup for you coffee
Hey, Thomas I know you won't see this but, you make me feel comfortable with myself and proud to be me (I'm bisexual) you are a role model and whenever someone is being rude to me about who I am I think of what you would do, and to help people in every way possible.Thanks for being an amazing person Thomas
It’s all true
Did they not realize virgil’s eyeshadow changed?
The eyeshadow changes are adorable
HZAAJALKHAK THE END WHERE ROMAN CALLED VIRGIL A EMO MADE MY HEART GO LIKE SH:AKSLKDSAJDLAJLAJ
bro that one guy in the bathroom tho. "I-i didn't wanna ruin the moment" ... a fricking beautiful man
Damn this makes me wish I wasn't poor to support you or get merch smh
The idea of watching Roman do gay eyes live action is what I now live for
Me hears you can live like jack and sally if you wanna                hmm                                                also me " MY. Six Strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as i state I counted the webs from all the spiders come creeping on so haunting every time " aka I miss you song
Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that this might've really happened and Thomas might actually have a crush-
PRINXIETTYYYYY-
(23:11) Is it just me or is Virgil's eye shadow shiny?
Lol, just because they have a rainbow pin doesn't mean they are gay, just saying, I'm straight but I have a rainbow sticker on my computer because I support 💓💛💚💙💜
Thomas you should react to sanderside meme's
Who else wants a Virgil back story or just a Virgil episode
P r i n x i e t y  F O R.  L I F E
Thomas: Singer Nico: Songwriter   :^  Thomas: Likes flowers and lives in Florida (which means land of flowers) Nico: Last names is Flores, means flowers   :>  Thomas: Awkward bean Nico: Accepts the awkwardness and remains calm for him  *u*  Ship: Activated
You can't tell me that Thomas doesn't ship Prinxiety  The constant nicknames from Roman to Virgil was ok, but this, this Thomas, is a whole new level  You can't deny it anymore   I'm onto you
HIS EYESHADOW THO! I LOVE IT VIRGIEEEEEE
Thomas do you watch the owl house
I have seen working gay eyes. I swear to god, these people have such a good gaydar that it has texting.
Roman: I think I saw some wide vowels! Virgil: Ne-vah-da?? Roman: More than that!! Virgil: An-a-con-dah?? Roman: ANACONDA! Thomas! He's a Nicki Minaj fan!!  Me: Sounds about right-
Roman and Virgil using play on words and metaphors to argue with eachother is amazing
Wow good job at the beginning
I only just realised that Roman and Remus are probably based Romulus and Remus because in that story Romulus ends up killed Remus and this matches Roman and Remus’ relationship
Is he gay or european?
Title: Flirting with Social Anxiety Me who thought it meant flirting with Virgil: *what*
My friend showed me this at a sleepover (yes, we still have sleepovers in quarrentine.) I literally exploded into a screeching ball of pringxiety.
#Prixiety moment 😆😆😆 💜♥️
I just can't stop thinking about how adorable it is that near the end Virgil is in a pretty good mood; it just makes my day so much better I love him so mucchh
You inspired me to talk about my personality’s-
19:51 the gay shoulder
This is like the first cannon episode of prinxiety in the real series   I AM FANGIRLING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE PRINXIETY CANON YAY!!!!!💖💜❤💜❤💜❤💜  IS ANYONE ELSE FAN(insert pronoun) ABOUT PRINXIETY YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET 💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜
2:30
We love a classic disney gay love story... oh, wait.
11:54 What The—
Virgils eyeshadow: My eyebags: *you and i are not too different*
OMG VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW!!!
Has anyone realised that Logan's voice has dropped a  in comparison to the first SS vid?
Thomas... there will be so many fanfics about the ending... 😂
Why did it take me this long to subscribe? I love Thomas so much!
Well now we can actually tell Virgils emotions
Its 2 months later, and I'm still watching this. It's that good
I love this-
I would but i'm broke i'm sorryyyyyy
ARE YOU GAY YESSSSSS THE FANFICS CAN COME TRUE FOR US ALL BTW Gays RULE my GF is gay so this is so good
I am going to use this
Virgil: ok... ok.. Thomas.... you, you need to walk around the room because that that’s that... helps somehow 😂
This Is Awesome!
Virgil was ready to throw down with the next person who told him to "Relax" and I couldn't be more with it.
I love imagining that Janus takes care of the Patreon because he inmediatly found the rest of the Sides unable to handle it
“Is that fair to him?” Virgil was talking about Deceit, not the cute guy 🥺
LOVVVED THIS EPISODE
aww I feel so jealous
never have I seen a perfectly EMPTY bathroom at the mall
Roman seems to be fine after last SS episodes, better than ever actually
virgil blushing is gxtgdbgtjyrduserzwaeesdytrerwewe everything I need
I dont see this happening but i can't wait till tomas gets a boyfriend but the chances of it happening soon is slim you don't normally find love while looking for it
Did anyone notice Virgil's eyeshadow change
This video could've been gayer ahaaa
Did anyone else notice at 21:33 Janus is wearing Remus's belt!?!
OMG this made me cry (happy cry) (♡ω♡*)
i was explaining gay eyes to a friend, to which they replied with "Hey, isn't that literally eyefucking?" i stayed silent after that.
23:10 look at his eye shadow
Guys guys..... Will the new side be ego? Think about it.... Logan is facts, his replacement is Deceit.... Roman and Remus being both sides of creativity..... For Patton being the selfless side...Would his counterpart be Ego?....just saying
His eyeshadow turns PURPLE!!!!!
7:12 This is literally my friend and I trying to hook our friend up with someone! 😂
Make more >:3
I'm unbearably upset that I am so late but this is so cute im hyperventilating lmao!
anxiety can definitely also push you to do things along with holding you back from them. More duality than a kpop idol
Are you gonna post more
Now I think prinxiety is cannon and no offence, I'm SAD
Roman: HES A NICKY MENAJ FAN!!!!!!
Ay yo pat i dare you to look up adultery
the eyeshadow!!!!! THE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
What happened to the binoculars
Salt and cheese 😂
Pintroverts me I’m gonna need you to shake your hands you gotta do something with them  Edit: neither of those were coherent sentences
17:09 favorite part  virgil freaking out and just JFHJFHJF AHH
Why do I feel this so much
HAPPY BIRTHDAY VIRGIL!
Me: *sees Roman and virgil*       Also me at the end: *donald duck noises*
blink 182 aww
Oh my gosh I hope it was based on a true story
I didn't know before but I think I have social anxiety. Your videos are very inspiring thank u. I'm looking forward to solve the problem
WAAAAIT WAIT WAIT THE CREEP REFERENCE! I’ve watched this 4 times and I only just noticed it! That’s genius 😂
THOMAS DEFINETILY SHIPS PRINXIATY FOR SURRRREEEE YOU CAN NOT SAY HE JUST MADE VIRGIL GO FULL GAY PANIC WHEN ROMAN TOUCHED HIS SHOLDER AS A ACT OFNOTHINGGFGADCUwgefikuwcu
Question: It took five seconds for Thomas and Prinxiety to look at the pins—how did the food court line clear that fast? 😂😂😂 I need to go to that place—the lines here are atrociously long!
Prinxiety fans have entered the chat
19:44 Virgil: In all honesty... I really don't know what that was.  Me: IT WAS AMAZING THAT'S WHAT IT WAS!! THOMASJUSTWENTUPTOHIMAND- FJAKDVJSHSBIFUSNFUSKDGURISHDJH WHAT?! Roman: Bravery. Me: Uh, um... uh ya tha- that too...
Roman: BLANTLY STEALING HUH GRANDPA!? me: *falls out of chair laughing*
Part 2??? I loved this a lot.
I relate so much it hurts. I feel naked...
Hi
Virgil has used Gay Panic. It's SUPER EFFECTIVE
Do a pool party with the sides
part 2 plisssssssssssssssssssssssssssss >:D
23:18 He had no purple for like one clip rip
This video triggered second hand anxiety. 🥺😳
13:56 Virgil reflection also looks at Thomas like some sort of paranormal crap
I loved iiiiiiiitttttt❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me watching this the second time: *Still gay screeching because the gayness levels are too much, but it’s still beautiful because it just is*
Virgil is so adorable. When he felt bad bc roman was sad so he pushed thomas forward. The "THIS IS FINE EXEPT NOT BC IM TOTTALLY PANICKING". The way he looked when roman said "bravery" 😢😢
sir.... ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE US SHIP VIRGIL AND ROMAN-
“IT’S LIKE CYBER STALKING.... BUT REAL LIFE!”  “So.... stalking.” “OH YOUR RIGHT!!!!!”  That got me 😂
If you wanna get- Dog: " *Rough Rough* "
I just realized that Virgil has purple eye shadow
I've watched this too many times to be healthy...
I wouldn’t be surprised if someone made a princey/Virgil ship
*happy*
Wait they all refer to themselves as we this is just a theory but what if Thomas has D.I.D?
Are you going to do another Sanders Sides vidio for christmas please😄🙏
Roman was a little bit flirty with virgil, just saying, even though there like the same person
Wow 😮 i really enjoy it "you are what you want"😉
I loved it!!!
Hey Tomas have you seen this vid ?https://youtu.be/coklrfnrqMk Not hate I love your vids but I just wanted to know... it seems that something happened that upset the person? You didn’t know probably I’m just confused what actually happened.
2:45 so nobody gonna talk about that? 𝗮𝗹𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁
We wanna see the last side Thomasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssskkskskskskskskskskskskskks. Love Janus by the way. I want(need) more episodes with him
Who else misses Vine whenever you see Thomas Sanders
How do you feel about your sanders sides becoming a full proper internet fandom equal to fnaf and creepypasta
AHhhhhhhahhahahahwhhahHahahahahhwheshhzgsge.       ah......
How does Virgil NOT know about gay eyes before this episode? If he's an expert in antisocial etiquette, one would expect that he would already know something like this, right?
"shut up emo" Literally my life🤣🤣🤣
my heart hurts..
Are you related to Bernie Sanders
I’m smiling so much my hearts gonna explode
Roman and Virgil remind me of the devil and angel that sit on your shoulders in this
Hmmmmmm could be✨gayer✨
2:30 video starts here
virgil and roman during the video :talking   me : Are They DATING !!? I Need to KNOW I NEED ANSERS !!?
Bravery?? Huh it that a foreshadowing something
The trite mall scientifically guarantee because option particularly afford athwart a faithful air. statuesque, roasted opinion
Purple eye shadow...        Perfect!!!!!!
Is anyone else noticing the different eye shadow Virgil was wearing? sometimes it was black, other times it was purple, idk if that's an important detail but i haven't seen anyone else point it out so... thought that i might as well??
OOF the alarm ringing at the store!!! I've BEEN THERE an employee at a store forgot to take a plastic thing off a shirt that I bought so it tripped the alarm and I was shaking at the end of the ordeal because I knew that I didn't steal anything but I was terrified!!!!
I LOVE THIAFBFJNFFN okay i feel like Virgil and Roman would be at the front seat most of the time then Logan and Patton would be there when making decisions
If this was a real situation thomas would just  Imagine virgil and roman fighting and forget about the hot dude
I get second hand embarrassment so it is physically painful for me to watch. this every few minutes I just stand up And take a breather and then I can go back to the video I have paused like 5 times in this video
Bro I gotta meet a girl like this... it was so relatable 😆 Also I'm gonna put pride pins on everything now! 🌈 :)
Why did I smile and sound like a chipmunk while watching this? 🤣 Lmao 🐿️
Ahhh, so adorable!!! Lol so his name's Neo, aye? 😆😁
Plot Twist: Virgil is not anxiety he is Gay Panic
he still lives in that house tho
8:59
"we don't know if he's gay" Me being bisexual: OH SO YOU SAY THAT HUH!!! I GET REJECTED BY MEN AND WOMEN YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT A WEIRD BI FURRY HAHAHAHAHHA My family : there she goes
After watching this I'm starting to see a pattern of what gay people most likely have after realizing stickers and patches play a big role as I remember the amount of stickers and patches that my gay friends have.
Why did he go he is so funny
Who is this dude
I would, but I don't think I could pay every month :/ Btw, anyone else notice that Virgil's eye shadow keeps changing???
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT ROMAN HAVING A LOLLIPOP AT 4:06 ?!
Wait was this staged or did this actually happen because I can’t tell. But either way great job Thomas! You never fail to amaze me, what is this the 7th time I’ve re-watched this?
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW AT THE END
Covid-19 🦠 😷
*the return of the king*
17:18 Can social anxiety touch you?😅  The story was adorable, by the way😸~
PRINXIETY
For as much as I love the entire video, the secondhand embarrassment was a lot to handle. I can't imagine what it must be like to actually go through something like this.
not me watching this at 4am and hanging on to every detail like its a cinematic masterpiece like all of ur videos gghv
This make me cry of happiness and because I can relate so much
SO FRICKEN CUTE OML!!!!
❤️- It happens 30 times a day dude. Please rel- 💜- DONT TELL ME TO RELAX! *Virgil is a mood.*
Quick question Thomas. Are those of us who unfortunately can't become patrons still get blooper vids? I have to wait until I start working next year to pledge. I have been hoping to be a part of the membership, and now the patreon. Love you and all the work you do!
11:02 IS THAT A JACKSEPTICEYE REFERENCE I SEE?!?
Right after they talked about “gay eyes” I got a commercial for church of Christ...kinda awkward lol
THIS HURTS TO WATCH BC THIS IS SO ME.
Hi Thomas, so I know you will probably never see this but I'd like to ask a question if its okay... When you came out as gay were you scared? And did the people in your life accept you? I want to come out to my family, my friends already know, but their Christian and not super accepting of the lgbtq community so I dont really know what to do and I dont have anyone I can talk too so I hope you don't mind me asking.
17:09 In that moment, Virgil seemed like a little kid to me for some reason. He was just trying to figure out what happened and was confused and it was just so adorable.
19:39  You'll thank me later😊😊
Sanders are you actually gay!?
I have to imagine that it’s really hard to approach a guy when you are a guy. I mean it would be kind of awkward if he isn’t gay. And I guess the majority of guys are prob straight.
Hes not even in this video
Paten is like meat soft.
Am I the only one that thinks that his laugh and the way he panics is so cute!
This whole video reminds me of me sitting in the library @ university and staring at some guy and trying to decide whether his smile was an invite.
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Awwwwwwww
I would love to see this in live action! I love this sooooo much!!
Is this your way of telling us you got a date?
wait roman gave Virgil gay eyes to show him gay eyes and- I need to calm down and keep my shipping for Reddit
4:01 “STOP PLAYING WITH PEOPLE’S HEARTS, THOMAS!”  This is how I felt after the episode before this one.   And also this one, because it was so adorable and my heart exploded (figuratively) from the cuteness.
Roman: So.. stalking Virgil:.. Virgil: OH, YOURE RIGHT  Tell me why I laughed the most at this
Everybody shipping virgil x roman :  Me: aren't they like- brothers that hate each other-  Uh-
Virgil:*has purple eye shadow* me: *screams omg for eternity*
YAY YOU UPLOADED! (Please upload more often 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 ) I am lesbian and love this video XD please read this comment ! Can you respond to this comment if you did this would be my dream!!
yall should make more of theses there awesome!!
Does Virgil's eye makeup change?? 22:54 and 22:59
i want to know who disliked the video this should have zero dislikes huh
The change in Virgil eyeshadow from anxious black to glitter purple!!! The bad anxiety and the good anxiety!!!
"i hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay,"  also, who else was freaking out over the purple eyeshadow-?
Virgil's eye shadow changes with Virgil's mood. Look at the end when virgil was happy it's pink while when the dog barks it's black
Welp..... yey... the unnecessary " liar, liar, liar, LIAR!!!"
Why when he said his name was Nico did I think of Nico Di Angelo from Percy Jackson???
O M G   I can't stop watching the end of the animatic part and the SHOULDER TOUCHHHH REEEEE. As a Prinxiety shipper I am trying to stay calm.
Your videos are the only ones my snake watches sitting still.
Ik your superbusy and may not see this, but imma take the risk. if you ever do another sanders sides q+a, now that they have grown, and you could add Janus and the duke,  what do they and you think of they most common ships? (prinxiety, logicality, and dukceit?)
I saw a Yugioh button
😂😂😂😂😂
I love how Roman says this romantic sounding thing and then he has to dumb it down to “Cutie at 12 o’clock”
Roman: dude, it's okay, that happens 30 times a day, please rela-  Virgil: DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX!!!!!!
It’s been so many years and you still haven’t moved houses or apartments
Why is this me (I’m a Gemini)
PRINXIETY
Wait!? Does tom finally have a boyfriend!?
19:38 do I smell a bit of ship?
Did anyone notice virgil's eyeshadow get purple and colorful when he got happy then it went back to the black?
Why do i ship roman and virgil???
Virgil: AH DEMON 😂😂😂
"Courage isn't a matter of not being frightened, you know.  It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway." - 3rd Doctor
Anyone else looking forward for the next video where it shows Patton and Roman together? I really want to know how Roman will act like after seeing Patton again after he didn't stand up for him against Janus. Would he just act like he completely forgot about what happened? Or would he be a little off because, you know, it's Roman?
So are they going to be doing a live action for this? i need answers if they are i am going to scream for happiness
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE LITTLE HEARTS AT THE END WHEN RO LOOKED AT VIRGE?!?!-
Whait is Thomas actually gay
HOLY THE ENDING I LIVE IIITTT AND WHEN HE SAID SHUT UP EMO
Haha this is me everyday
This girl came up to me and told me she liked girl in red and is this one of those,‘I’m gay you are to aren’t you’ things or she just has really good (and gay) taste in music
This... may sound really  weird.... but I've kinda created my own versions of Roman, Virgil, Logan, and Patton and it's honestly been helpful for me when thinking about my emotions and my life and decisions.... thank you Thomas for all you do. You make my heart very smiley.
This is the cutest thing EVER!!!
Anybody who doesn't ship Roman and Virgil       Is an absolutely fine human being, I just don't agree with you
low-key thought they would be flirting with virgil hauisdafads
Good to see Virgil and prince getting along.
ANYONE GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW CHANGING?!?!!??
This is so cute
"O beauteous bard in the court of food, finally got a chance with this dude" There did it for you, Roman
This is an example of Princxiety
I literally only want to see the live action version of this to see who Nico will be-
Haven’t watched you in 3 years
Flirting with social anxiety that dont happen
I’m feeling anxious and embarrassed FOR him
Vrig is like *GAY Panic gay panic*
I'M HAVING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS
In /"Tempest Tongue"/? ( 24:05 if you put captions on) That is so freaking cool. Talent
Virgil: we can live like Jack and sally if you want~  Me: *blinks 182 times*   Also me: *dies*
i loved everything about this thomas perfectly displaying how akward people function around people their attracted too, virgil and romans contradicting advice the ENTIRE video, and i LOVE the art style/animation it was INCREADIBLE C:
I laughed way to hard at the “GASP! Disaster!” line  after the “gay eyes” fail. 😂
aaaawe we allmost cryd aaaaw this was so pure and lovely! ♡♡♡♡♡
This was cute
I cant stop laughing 😂😂😂
Ship?
Y.E.S
Not sure if you’ll see this Thomas, But a video talking about How to tell your parents your sexuality would be gr8.
Virgil with the purple eyeshadow looks like a fairy! 💛💛💛
I find it weird to see Virgil and Roman agreeing on things  Masterful episode Sir Thomas
I’m now calling Roman broman  Dude at the end literally a rogill moment
I haven't seen one comment about the fact Virgils eye shadow switched from black to a sprakly purple!!!!! It has to mean something!!
I've been trying not to scream and laugh so many times, it's like 2AM rn-
"You're a creep, you're a weirdo....." *Virgil noticed an opportunity* ".. What the hell are we doing here?"  For y'all that don't get the joke listen to Creep by Radiohead
This is Bringing out the fanboy out in me  lol
14:18 S I R     I JUST CHOKED ON MY SKITTLES
Virgil is do relatable lmao  (I have social anxiety disorder)
GAY EYES
I LOVE THE vines
THIS IS ME! But I would have my iPad
The comedy is everything 😊 and can’t forget about the relatable moments
i ship virgal and roman
that was cute thomas
I did this and the person I was talking to said she was straight then left. I WAS SO SURE SHE WAS GAY. she had purple and black hair and hing out with lgbtq friends that I knew.
This is the embodiment of Gay Panic
O  M  G  VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW IS SO FRICKIN' ADORABLE!!!!! (Seeing as he's portrayed by Thomas Sanders who is FRICKIN' ADORABLE!!!!!<3 ILYSM)
I love this better than the normal one this is my third time watching
JOAN!!!!!!!!!! HI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (If you guys don't know what I'm talking about... Joan was the Random Stranger)
*MY FAVORITE QUOTES* Thomas: "We don't even know if he's Gay..." Roman: "Ah, but you're missing 1 key thing, Thomas... We don't know if he's *not* Gay C;"  Thomas: "You have used that argument on me *far* to many times..."  Virgil: "You have 5 seconds max!"  Roman: "What? I'm-I'm not Max! I'm Prince Roman!"  Virgil: "No, man!" Roman: "Ugh, it's RO-man, with an R? Ugh, you're really struggling today..."  Virgil: "That's like cyber-stalking... But real life!" Roman: "So..... Stalking?....." Virgil: "......OH! YOU'RE RIGHT!"  XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD #Prinxiety <3
So... I print pictures and color them in from Brei Grace, so right before Thomas said Brei, even on my first time watching this, we both said 'Brei Grace' :D Brei, if you're offering art lessons........ I'd want some...
THIS CAME OUT 17 DAYS BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY!!!!! TYSM!!!!!! sorry :)
The ships are salling
I’m sry to ask but is Thomas gay I’m sry I just need to know
Who else saw a bit of virgil x Roman in the end of that because I sure did
Love the Radiohead references!
I personally relate to the song he was explaining
DAMN the bathroom scene! I CANT
Yes It's back yay
Okay I relate so much to Thomas and Virgil in this-
So what happened with Thomas and Niko? Are they together irl?
Why do people ship Princy and Virgil anyway??
I'm waiting for the dark side Insanity to come in soon
17:44
Me only listening to Roman talking: Hah, he’s gay—
10:43  Roman:what are you doing?  Thomas: i dunno.... plant
ive never related to anything so much in my life until now https://youtu.be/ErSL__rgusk?t=1037
When is the next one coming out
akyfhvmbjgfdrsfxbvhgf my hearttttt yeesss 🥺this was so cute
I recently texted a girl I've been crushing on for over a year now just to offer her friendship and the amount of anxiety... well it took over a year just to offer friendship so you can guess. Regardless we're kinda friends now I think and I'm proud of myself for talking to her
Its so beautiful it makes me wanna cry love the video
I- um- eh- ........ my life is a disaster
Okay so if by some miracle Thomas himself sees this, can you answer this:     are prinxiety, logicality, or demus canon? I can't find an answer ^^;;
I just wanted to tell you that because of this video I put a rainbow heart pin on my backpack. And now I have a girlfriend which makes me a happy gal
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE

What about bisexual eyes hmmmm (•̀ᴗ•́)و
"30 times a day" Huh..............
You look high                                Jokez
can you do them all like this
The levels of adorableness in this episode are unfairly high.   You might even say they’re....  *infinitesimal.*
Thomas I'm broke
I wanna be one of those bystanders at the mall watching this poor guy get pushed around by beings you can’t see
“Reasons you can guess” why did I immediately think JOAN IS DEAD!!!
7:15 my favorite scene
ME: FINALLY A NEW SANDERS SIDES VIDEO! WE HAVE NOT HAD ONE SINCE MAY
Did this actually happen? No seriously did it Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I’m fangirlinggggg 😖 Edit: and I just realized that Roman and Virgil blushed i dont know if Roman blushed because of Thomas thinking nico was cute so  But virgil blushed when Roman said “bravery” and looked like really sincere sooo eeeeeee! Prinxiety U-U
THE WAY IM A MONTH LATE- AHHHHH
I never understood the painting in the background
Okay, but I'm still not over how awkward and adorable Nico and C!Thomas are when they start taking 😭
Eh... could be gayer
I still can’t get over this video
Prinxiety is happening, *people who don't ship it: but its-* *STFU ITS CODE G A Y-*
Virgil's eye shadow changed I am pretty sure it could potentially show his sides? I know I am late I already saw the video I decided to watch it again because it is so good
You know what we need? A SANDERS SIDES MUSICAL PERFORMANCE. I WANNA BE JANUS IF IT HAPPENS. PLEASE MAKE SANDERS SIDES MUSICAL. PLEASE. A SANDERS SIDES PLAY/MUSICAL.
"Oh, no, I wasn't testing you. I was just panicking."  Felt that in my soul
Heterosexual romance: difficult  Homosexual romance: very difficult  Me: The only winning move is not to play!
Wait....DID HE ACTUALLY GET THE GUY?! I NEED TO KNOW!
Is no one really going to address the fact that Thomas made a Jacksepticeye reference.
I'M FANGIRLING SO HAAAARD
ROMAN x VIRGIL IS CANNON
how to communicate in 2020: *stickers*
I RELATE SO HARD TO HIM LOVING THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
Is that legos on the table
It's it just me or does Virgils drawing look ALOT  like Nico Di Angelo from Percy Jackson, he also acts like him. Or maybe I've been fangirling Solangelo too much
4:41          After that I put stickers on my laptop        18:51
just me or do the sides remind me of osomatsu sextuplets???
14:43 Why is nobody talking about that poor random guy ;u;?
Virgil:Is happy with Roman Me:IT'S SHIPPING TIME(demonic face)
Roman- “Thomas needs to rise to the occasion”  Me- “OF OUR NEW NATION!”
Love you work so much 😎
Omg I loved that
OMG this is soo CUTE 😁😁
I'm gonna put some stickers on my backpack... just in case.
Look at virgil at 5:13
After 3 times of watching this episode- I noticed the reference to the song "Creep" by Radiohead at 6:48-  "You're a creep. You're a weirdo. What the Hell are we doing here?"
´´I really don´t know what that was.´´         ´´Gayvery.´´
I AM FANGIRLING SO HARD RN
Ok this was the most amazing love story I've ever seen but I have one question WAS THIS REAL
LOL THE 96 ON THE TABLE
I love this video, it is amazing, and hilarious, and beutiful art, and it completes me, thank you Thomas and his friends. ^-^
I am a proud Pintrovet ^-^
Bravery
this made my night. I had had a bad day at work and this made me smile. I know I am late to the party for this video but this was cute as heck omg
I never thought that I'd cry watching this
Good job on the art ^^
Hey Thomas have you looked at the symptoms for DID (disositive identity disorder) you seem to show some of them for sure in your vines
i love these so so much! hope there is another one, if there is i cant wait!
Me:*really want’s Roman to have a emotional break down* Also Me:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I can’t join your I mean Janus’s patron T^T
evryone: *geeking over the new eyeshadow me: where is everyone else?
This literally confirms prinxiety if past videos did not. Like seriously
Thomas: Nothing but a bruised ego  Roman: *hmph*
Lol Virgil x Roman anyone
ok wow, this was really dang good holy cow!
Thomas is one of the only people who still look good even when they look like they haven't slapped sense 2013
Shut up. shut up Shut UP!!
The Title: Gay or Nay? me: Gay...Its gay, HE HAS TO BE GAY I DENY THE FACT IF HE IS NOT GAY
My hart 😍
Thomas: he's better off without me...  Me: omg I just wanna give you a hug!! you are amazing! never forget that!
OMG THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!
When I say I flew at the end-
Totally haven't binged these videos to catch up noooooooo what are you talking about
I love that ending!
"Huh... _Delete it_ "
I don't know how many times I've rewatched this, it just never gets old! I love this video so much, it gives me my daily dose of serotonin lol.
mY hEaRt MeLtEd ArGhHhHhH
Jeez, this fully represents me in terms of dating
We need a video where all the sides arw in it
is it weird for me to ship purple Thomas and red Thomas
I love then ending because of how happy Virgil is!
I feel like this guy was a major cause of gay no longer being an insult
omg I litterally started crying at the end.... this was perfect...
I started watching this when it first came out but I stopped because it made me really anxious and I'm trying to finish it now and my gosh NOTHINGS CHANGED I AM SO GLAD VIRGIL PUSHED HIM AT 10:42  also the animation is really really adorable and that's helping
19:51         *squealing like a high pitched dolphin while my mom thinks I'm crazy*
"Shut up emo" OMG THIS IS TO CUTE
22:40 HIS EYESHADOW GUSYNITS PURPLE
Idea that we would love to see and can be done in quarantine: The footage you took for Learning New Things About Ourselves before the puppets, with you acting it out instead
Okay so I got an idea, what if the next side is just the personification of Hormones. I mean people theorise that the next one is a “dark side”. And I don’t know about you guys but hormones are pretty annoying to me.
PLEASE TELL ME NIKO IS REAL!!!!!!
V: That’s like cyber-stalking...but in real life! R: ...So...stalking? V: GGAAAASSSSPPP
SHUT UP, EMO
Virgil:"Will deceit continue to be the answer to ALL of your problems?" Janus: Why are you putting ME into this!? I didn't even SAY anything!
V: But if you keep pulling at those heartstrings, the heart is gonna break. P: *Chuckles* I'm in danger.
Virgil at the end "your gonna need to shake your hands" Dude deadass said normalize stimming
Virgil holding that popcorn 🍿   when he leaves just eats that popcorn NOM   I’m so werid 👁👄👁  LAIR!   We don’t if he’s not gay   HE GAY BRO
GUYS IM SOBBING T TTHE FACT THAT VIRGIL REALLY DEFIED HIS WHOKE EXISTENCE AND PUSHED THOMAS BECAHSE HE SAW ROMAN UPSET IM SO ASBAHSHSHSHDSH edit: what the hell I'm rewatching sander sides n i decided to go into the comments n ???? OH MY GOD???? I HAVENT BEEN HERE IN A YEAR N I COME BACK TO THIS WHAT THE HELL TY??? THIS IS SO LATE IK 😭😭😭
This entire video is an accurate representation of gay panicking
"He's got some stickers on his laptop" "~That's pretty gay~" I can't be the only one who lives life thinking about how many gay stereotypes I prove right🤣
I dunno plant?
I love how you showed us about being brave to walk to someone and say “hi” to them and to them and possibly fall in love with them or fall in love with them when you see them and are trying to find the courage needed to talk to them, I absolutely love it because as you know a lot of us don’t have the courage to walk up to the people we fall in love with and it feels over bearing to just look at them and think of the countless possibilities of what your life would be like with them, and I’m absolutely happy that you brought it to light. And the art style is absolutely amazing the animation is amazing everything about this Sander Sides video is amazing and I’m also happy to hear that the Bravery and Fear of your Heart are working together outstandingly to help you on the way.
Is this considered Canon to Sanders Sides?
"Aagh! Demon!" "Don't tell me to relax"  😂😂😂
The bags under Virgil’s eyes are Gucci-
PLEASE make a live action version
19:30 hate to be that person but.... did Thomas and his crush switch sides at the table?
You can almost hear the prinxiety shippers screaming watching this episode
Can someone give me the time stamp for gay eyes?
Gerard gay has gotta be the best pun ive ever heard...
Virgil is a p*rnstar  confirmed
Me poor boi and can’t buy crap
Dude you are funny.  Me and my son love your content
I think I may have a fake friend. Someone I thought liked and cared about me but multiple other people I am also close with are saying that they don't like me. They said they don't like me because of my brother. What do I do? I am asking you people's because you know stuff. Confirmed I have a fake friend
Drugs? don' t need it. i have sander sides.
Thomas: “Mr.Sanders but you can call me Thomas.”  Me: *flashbacks to the Growing Up episode*
As a gay, I can confirm gay eyes are a thing.
Soon virgil will know gay eyes
19:56 I'm starting to suspect that Thomas ships them too
Thomas is my favorite content creator and this is my favorite series
Those two talking over each other while Thomas does nothing is a great way to put "internal panic"
HEY THIS IS UNRELATED TO THE VIDEO BUT IM TRYING TO FIND MY FRIEND !!!! THEIR NAME IS MATTIE OR SOEMTHING CLOSE TO THAT AND I MET THEM AT THE POOL AND THEY DIDNT FRIEND ME ON DISCORD YET ! THEY ARE BISEXUAL AND TOLD ME THEY LOVE SANDERS SIDES (PATTON AND LOGAN ARE THEIR FAVORITES) IF YOU ARE HERE PLEASE REPLY !!! WE BOTH LIVE IN OAHU ! BOOST THIS MESSAGE PLEASE I NEED TO FIND THEM
I can’t believe how insightful this is.
thomas sanders is the only man i love. been watching since the vine days. B)
this is just super fabulous. And Thomas, you are incredibly talented; if I hadn't had the background knowledge I have, and someone told me that Character Thomas, Roman, and Virgil were each voiced by a different person, I might've believed them! They're so distinct!
Seriously though when will you add insanity and fear
I completely forgot this guy existed
I fucking loved this
I love thissss
Janus’s theme is my favorite
Alternate ending: thomas misses his chance with nico and starts to have chemistry with the guy in the bathroom stall
Did this actually happen?
I was watching this at 4 am I was crying😭😭 this pulled my heartstrings and when the rambling starts, too relatable
sorry to ain on your black parade gerard gay lol
why is the “idontknow... plant🥺🥺” such a mood
I'm radiating second hand embarrassment
7:53  With an R- your really struggling today...  me who has almost always referred to him as princey... rrincey??
I'm squealing right now I loved this
2nd time watching this; the first time i watch this i was dying from second hand embarrassment but i find the video funny and inspiring the more i see it as someone with social anxiety, seeing Thomas over come his struggles with approaching people and Virgil .through out the video was just👌. Over coming my anxiety is something i'm very much trying to work on, and as someone who want to start animating and is exploring animatics this video is automatically one of my favorites.
Nico.... I feel that was a gay or European reference... I may be wrong
Okay but if Virgil was "once a dark side," does that mean "bravery" is his light side?
"There, I see him Sitting there across the court He don't got a lot to say  But there's something about him And I don't know why But I'm dying to try I need to.. Talk to him"
Thomas in the dark side of Disney: I HATE CARROTS Thomas in FWSA : *Buying things from KarrotKing*
It's official. It's RomanxVirgil  and nothing else.
so cute!
When Virgil gets excited his eyeshadow changes to purple I-
OH I FINALLY GOT IT! IF YOU WANNA GET _ROUGH—_
OH MAH GUAD MY HEART STRINGS
He wonders why thomas is anxious when anxiety is there
DOES THOMAS HAVE A BOYFRIEND
Virgil in good mood = purple shadow Virgil in less good mood = black shadow
OH MY GOD It is so cringy AND I LOVE IT and he is legit just like me... panic too much
omg i loved this video
"I'd hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay.."   YES!!!!! MY NEW FAVORITE THING TO SAY!!!!
Hi I'm Italian. I started following your YouTube channel thanks to fandom right away I started following you and for me you are very good😄   POV. I ship Virgil and roman😏🤫
The change of Virgil's eyeshadow from purple, showing the excitement and joy in him, to black is just..... AHH THE DETAILS, I LOVE IT!!!!
VIRGIL HAD PURPLE EYESHADOW
Me and moms friend were talking about Sanders sides and which Disney Character they would be and then looking at his Instagram of Patton and Logan in dresses for 2 hours!!!!😂😂😂
Prinxiety
I get it that its quarantine but this is just irritating
I too have a bad habit of accidentally wooing strangers in public restrooms
I found the perfect image. "5 microphones 1 braincell" https://ghosttb0y.tumblr.com/post/631869657509396481/5-microphones-1-brain-cell
I can hear the Prinxiety shippers screaming in the distance
Me at a meeting with my past present and future  Past: im here sorry guys   Present: welp I would be in bed   Future: I should have yeeted myself
I love the purple eyeshadow when Virge is happy!
“You did it again”  “Yeah, I’ve gotta stop wooing strangers in bathrooms” 15:00
8:34
so he is gay
I can't get over Roman's grin as he sinks away after calling Thomas old.
I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay.....  -Roman-  This is the end....  -Me-
Hey Virgil there’s a hot topic sale!!!!
Not me hyperventilating the entire time cause I felt it. WAIT WTF IM CRYING I-
The second hand embarrassment from this thoooo
Me: *see's a cute guy in public * I should talk to him........ Also me: BuT iS hE GaY?!
Wait is Thomas part of lbgtq
I actually have DID, and this reminds me of what happens in our mind.
:) I loved this story
*G A Y  E Y E S*
Roman: *Touches Virgil shoulder* Shippers: Now kiss
“After salt”  SO TRUE THO!! SALT BE DA BEST!!
I  love this 👬
I LOVE this it is tooo cute to handle!!!
so much panic. So much mood.
Who tf disliked this video?!
Way better love story than twilight light
Yes this came out a while ago. Yes I’m watching it because I have 1000 things to do and it’s 11pm yes I’m stressed and have a migraine incoming but still the happiness this gives me is just- 👌
22:33 VIRGIL the purple eyeshadow omg I love it how the heck did it take me this long to notice. Did others notice am I the only one that took this long to notice.
Lol, this is me almost every day.
The GOD FORSAKEN BOILED C A R R O T S
AGHHH THATS SO FRIGGEN CUTE I CANT
Cute story and all but you forgot the part when you check your hair and see your face and think you're way too ugly and then you just leave.
As soon as Thomas started his gay eyes there was an add for cat food that started with a cat exactly where Thomas was, amd it looked like the cat was using gay eyes too
MY SHIP IS SAILINNGGG
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS THE MOST ADORABLE THING EVER FRICJJKSFDJKGGR
This was amazing!!! I wouldn't be mad if another animation just happened to be on your channel😏
In The Dark Side Of Disney episode thomas says he despises carrots, so now him buying that steamed carrot meal and instantly regretting it is twice as funny to me
uhh hey i would like to ask Patton a question. I need emotional support when i tell my mum and dad  that i am lesbian. Any help?
The moment he say ”ahyeah super nosy!” * my soul shoots out my body from second hand embarrassment*
''shut up emo''     DJKHVJBFHSCVBHCNXVHBFAJ    I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Thomas Sanders my friend has a question for you... do the other sides know Virge is a dark side? or was?
VIRGIL'S EYEBAGS TURN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY I REPEAT VIRGIL'S EYEBAGS TURN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY THIS IS NOT A DRILL
I just binge watched ALL the episodes and I love the live action as much as this!  During these times, this format is VERY viable! Keep up the awesome work!
Light sides: RomAN, PattON, LogAN Dark sides: RemUS, JanUS And then there’s Virgil with the fabulous purple glitter eye shadow.
The end part is so goddamn adorable, I'm crying QwQ     VIRGIL IS ROCKING THE PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!! HE LOOKS SO ADORABLE IN IT!!!!! QWQ
Virgil: Thats like....cyber stalking but....in real life Roman: So....Stalking Virgil: ... Virgil: OH YOU'RE RIGHT!
PRINXIETY IS REAL
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IM BLUSHING AND FANGIRLING AT HOW ADORABLE THIS IS SEND HELP
i want this to happen to me one day
As someone who doesn’t really have social anxiety, I have to say the whole approach to talking to the attractive person really stressed me out. If people feel like that often I’m amazed they manage, really, also the amount of overthinking was just.. wow.
i live for ğ ặ ỹ
Thomas do you watch the owl house
I LOVE HOW VIRGIL IS WELL, VIRGIL SO MUCH. "Run around the block" "I think you need to pee." "Thomas I need you to shake your hands, they are just hanging, do something with them" definitely my anxiety.
YOU CANT TELL ME THAT PRINXIETY ISNT CANON NOWISIJSISISISJ
This is me every time I see any girl
Hey so i havnt been able to find many people who like sander sides but if u have discord and would like to join my server on sander sides if you could just reply to this also sorry if it seems like a me thing but i love sander sides and would love to meet new people
Love the animatic man! ❤️💜
Wait thomas is gay
It astounds me there are people in the word who can just go up to the person they like and tell them
Bizardvark
“Go home and regret everything.” Me: Mood
Tomas needs to make more animations
I really loved this episode, Virgil is my top favourite side and seeing him have a gay panic was the most adorable thing I've ever seen.  Also I've been meaning to ask, how would the sides react to spending the entire day and night with your sleep character (Remy)? Hope you and your friends are staying safe and still having fun during covid 19 💜💜😊 Ps: tell the sides I said hi 😁
Who else sees all the prinxiety in this one episode. Also if you have captions on Nico name is cute stranger until we find out his name and I love it.
That's so awkward, even for me. 😬😂
I like to think that Thomas is just walking around on his own and is randomly is just running around ever
So longe IVE WAITED SANDERS >:)
4:17
Wait he’s gay
Few words Virgil had a g a y panic
Eye Shadow Change with Emotions or just with different takes?
Woah artist (no sarcasm don’t worry!)
So cute!!!!
I LOVE VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW
this is really good
Legit me and my last two brain cells trynna talk to a Girl
Can u please make new try not to laugh
ALEX1 ok
“Oh I’m not uh stinky”  IM DYING AH!!!
Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing between black, purple, and a mix of both
14:11 I f^ckin knew that was gunna happen
.... I miss Remus
Roman: ♡︎v♡︎
Roman said "Thomas has to rise to the occasion" H A M I L T O N ?
Pls never stop this series.. Watching you talk to yourself is my major happy pill  *wipes a tear*
"Great, he's gay." "Great indeed." "GREAT INDEED!⭐️”
I felt this whole episode. My inability to talk to new people is always hindering me. Especially at past conventions...
Also, PRINCE X ANXIETY >:3 ÙWÚ
I Laughed so HARD at the bathroom scene, 🤣😂. One of the best ones I've seen so far, 👌 👏👏👏. Would love to see it in live action 😁.
8:16 My bf and I just call it the gay-dar
I love the art style so much! And Virgil is just such a cute bean while Roman is just... Beautiful Roman because he's sweet and Princey.
It’s so annoying that I have the notifications on for this but was never notified!
Just wondering if you’ve watched new girl? Bc calling Roman “little punk” gave me major Schmidt vibes
Me at 19:40 : shut up— Shut up-  SHUT UP AAAAAA!!!!
If you think eny one is to good for you are worng and don't let dect tell you eny thing els
Wow how creative sampler side
Yaaas my ship and I’m not talking about Thomas
I like how Virgil pushing Thomas forward works on multiple levels. From a character standpoint it was Virgil overcoming his fears because he saw how much Roman needed it, while looking at them as parts of Thomas it's that feeling when anxiety switches from a barrier to a last-ditch motivator- an opportunity is about to pass you by and you have that sudden jolt of, "If I don't act Right Now I'm going to regret it".
Thomas stimming at the end there makes me feel better about my own 💜💜  I do that a lot when I’m nervous or excited or both
I'm having a*gay panic*    Also Prinxiety is 🌠life🌠
Me: *sees the phrase "social anxiety"* Also me: My favourite phrase! *Clicks*
I figured out Virgil’s eyeshadow purple is gay panic and black is regular panic.
Aww virgil's eyeshadow was purple, that was just an adorable episode. Im dying they finally worked together  that was do cute
Is it just me or did I know someone was in the stall before it became a part of the script I haven't went to-
he kinda sounds like jerry from rick and morty-
I feel so bad for the guy in the bathroom... like he was so happy then sad and ah
The true gay struggle is not knowing if someone is flirting with you or if there just being nice. Like this girl I’m kinda into complimented me and my brain is like  Is she flirting with me?  Nooooo Maybeeeeee
21:33 I AM ASSUMING THIS IS FROM THE RECORDING OF A FUTURE EPISODE.  So, what do we know about the episode.   - There will be a part in Virgil's room. - Janus will be affected by the anxiety eyebags. - Valerie (And possibly other friends of Thomas) will be in the episode. - Janus will be on the episode. - There will possibly be a song in episode, since they're using a green screen and they used a green screen in Remus' song. - This will probably be a big episode. Big as in lore and relationships of the sides.   THEORY OF THE EPISODE.   Janus is now trying to help Thomas with his problem, probably hiding it from Remus. Virgil doesn't approve this and hides for the half of the episode. That is, until Janus asks about him. The gang say that he didn't accept this change very well. Janus goes to Virgil's room and looks for him. When Virgil finally shows up, there will be an argument against Virgil and Janus. With Virgil seeing that he isn't winning the argument, he creates a fake Valerie similar to the one in the valentines video. That will probably lead to Janus singing. That is all i have for now.
tOp Of ThE mOrNiNg To YoU?
Everyone: Fangirls over Virgils eyeshadow.  Me: that las part would be amazing as a meme...
Is it just me or is this an ideal way to meet someone you like? (Might just be me... Sorry...)
i think that was a very good you should make more
Omg I love this!!!!!
I got so much second hand anxiety from this ;-:.
As a pintrovert Virgil is a whole mood
I just stumbled upon your channel and this series and I’m obsessed. I think I just binge watched every episode! I just feel bad I can’t join your patron, money is kinda tight right now. Also I love Patton’s dad jokes and I think I have a PUNtastic one (pun intended and no that is not the joke)! The joke is: what do you call a deer with no eyes? I have no eye deer (as Patton would say: ah ah get it, it sounds like I said I have no idear). Of course then Logan would probably be confused because it was so illogical, Roman will probably say some sarcastic  remark, and Virgil will either chuckle/smile (and try to hide his joy... obviously) or cringe.
I loved this episode so much. I’m actually crying
Okay, so rewatching and I heard Nico say "you're not going to tell me about them?" Wh-what if he can see the Sides???
Thanks Thomas for your amazing series. Your series brought me closer to my mother of gaysTM aka this amazing human who was in two and a half plays with me at our Catholic school. Yes we did make a gay theatre kid cult at my Catholic school but that's not the point. The point is I'm very grateful for this series keep up the good work and stay gay!
I love how Virgils eye makeup changes with his emotions!!!
I LOVE THE PRINXIETY MOMENTS THIS EPISODE HAD!
That was so beautiful ❤️😭
I really like this type of storytime
THE PRINXIETY VIBE
i love you
"JOIN ME! No thinking!"  Great plan.
Is everyone just gonna ignore the Disney castle in the background of Thomas’s living room??
i am just thinking about thomas ranting about virgil's sparkly purple eyeshadow to his friends the next day and them being like are you okay? but i just can't get thatthought out of my mind so i had to comment it aaaaaaaa i loved this episode oh my lorddd
This video gave me theory fodder on how the Sides (the core four, at least) are affected when Thomas is in a new relationship: Roman is clearly running at full-tilt, cuz he’s the center of Thomas’s romance and daydreams. Patton’s all giggly and bouncy, cuz new love and he’s Thomas’s emotions. Virgil’s always either freaking out or super chill, cuz when it’s still fresh, you never know if you’re gonna say something wrong that ruins everything, but you also feel safe with them. Logan is the only one unhappy, cuz the earliest phase of a relationship, aka the “honeymoon phase”, affects one’s focus, which leads to affected work-ethic. Plus, we know Logan’s not *too* pleased with Thomas’s friends getting in the way of work. How do you think he’d feel about a BOYFRIEND?
I love this.....please do more.
So did Logan and Patton find out? 😁 And did anyone notice the change in Virgil’s eye makeup? 💜🖤💜🖤
Something about Roman and Virgil working together makes me happy
cant cry in class cant cry in class cant cry in class- ah i loved this!
WAIT WAIT WAIT, I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.  Now that Janus is getting accepted (which also took him a lot less time than it took for Virgil) Virgil might start to feel betrayed or unimportant in a way and maybe try to isolate himself again. Roman, not liking Janus being accepted into the group and already having problems with his sense of self-worth and not being that fond of Janus, might relate to Virgil’s feelings, at least to an extent. Virgil and Roman may grow closer as they both may start to slowly grow more and more distant with the rest of the group.
UR SO AWESOMEEEEEE AAAAAAAAA
VIRGIL X ROMAN - ITS SO CUTE 🤪💞
When he left.  *I felt that*   On a more serious note. I SHIP ROMAN AND VIRGALLLL lol

Is he real i must KNOW
Happy virgil = Purple eyeshadow 😳😤
Did anyone else notice that when Virgil was happy without being stressed/anxious about things, his eyeshadow was purple but as soon as he became stressed or worried again it went back to black? I literally could not! Our anxious little baby (sorry Patton I'm stealing your "nickname") has come so far since first being introduced.💜💜😭
What if your sides date the sides of you boyfriend?
Is no one going to mention that Virgil's eyeshadow was a bright purple because he was so excited? I love the details in this series
Watch Virgil's eyeshadow: 22:48, 22:59, and a couple other times in that scene IT SWITCHES BETWEEN BLACK AND SPARKLY PURPLE
The U.S. on Wednesday and Thursday: 16:30
*g a y d a r*
lol thomas you dont kow what you have done XDDDD now princxiety shiper are gonna use this  to make it clear why they should be togeter
It might sound kinda overused, but I'd never really seen the social struggles of approaching people when having anxiety and being LGBTQ+ depicted so well. Man, usually it's difficult for me to relate to the content I view (which may be a little weird, but eh), but the way this hit closer to home than anything else I've seen today is... Whew! Thank you for making such adorable content, it makes me feel hopeful for the future and also, want to do more for myself.  Much love to you and your friends, Thomas!
"Pintrovert" New word made by roman Edit: when he was in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror I was looking at the stall in the back, and I was right, someone WAS there
My shipppppppp
"That's like cyber-stalking... But real life..."
G A Y   P A N I C   A L E R T!   G A Y   P A N I C   A L E R T!
I love Virgils new eye makeup :0 :D
Why is this making me want to cry in happiness
I LOVE HOW ACCURATE THIS IS OML
YES I BELEIVE I JUST SAW A SIGN IF VIRGIL X ROMAN
Haven't seen this dude in so long and I don't know why I stopped watching him in the first place😅🤣
Virgil love the purple eyeshadow!
Oh lord, this is me every single day...Also, as a person who loves to draw, I LOVE this design and art style!! I hope we can see more of this, even after this pandemic is over!!! Super funny and comical too!! And I just know this is just fueling the Roman and Virgil ships.
"*what* are you doing?" "idk, plants?"
10:08 I got this reference
I still have one question. Is Nico real or is he a character invented for the episode?
16:08  WHY IS THE GAY PANIC SO RELATABLE?!!!!!!!!!!!!
bruh ngl i cried  a little towards the end
Sssssoooooooo much Prinxiety fodder...(I think that's the ship name...)  Also, VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING IS SOO ADORABLE!
BELOW ME GAY
BELOW GW GAY
20:02 HE LEFT HIS HAND ON VIRGILS SHOULDERRRRRR
I gapsed aloud when Thomas said it's an animatic. yeeeesssss  the roller coaster that I experienced through this video:  Roman, Virgil stooop! it's an accident! an accident!  hehe, pintroverts.  what? no, wait! stop! why boiled carrots?? ahhh, just say hi? okay, saying hiiii annnnd wait no, LOOK OUT!   crap.   aww, poor guy in the stall.  is Thomas gonna be able to say hi to him finally???  dangit Roman and Virgil!!!   y'all keep blaming Deceit but, you guys are the one freaking out.   awwww, he was writing a song.  yayyyyyy, this is adorable. yay!
Yoooo this explains me in a nut shell congrats on the great animation
How do you install mods on minecraft? I've been wondering that for years.
If you do make this live action would you put it on YouTube as well as pateron. I know a lot of people can’t join your pateron for various reasons. 😁
Did this happen
I ship Thomas and Nico. XD They’d be so cute together! :D
AWWW HIS EYESHADOW I-
I’m now just discovering Sanders Sides, and this is so cute I can’t wait to watch more
I want to die now bc now I want to know is he dating him  now??? AHHhhHhHhHH
WHO ELSE FEELS REALLY BAD FOR THE DUDE IN THE BATHROOM
What's janis' theme called?
The play along guy looks like tommyinnit
These comments are 90% pinxiety and 90% Virgil's eyeshadow
I AWAIT THE EPISODE OF THE SANDER SIDES DEALING WITH FULL ON GAY PANIC MODE VIRGIL Edit: Just imagine, everyone else trying to reel a brand new version of Virgil while Roman is enjoying encouraging GAY PANIC mode. Patton is unsure of what to do as he is swayed in both directions and Logan is just trying to make heads or tails of it all with low success
20:10 StAp
“I don’t know, plant”
I want you to do sander sides animals please do be so cool
I LITERALLY got up and jumped and laugh at the line exchange of "...you saw me knock over that trash can didn't you?" "THAT WAS YOU?!"
"Bruised Ego" *Pouty Princey*
I’m just an extrovert over here like, this is the life of an introvert? Damn I feel bad for y’all
6:29 whyyyyy do they have threeeeeeee micssssssssss????????
Nex video can yall react to gacha life about yall
"Ugh... Pintroverts.."  -Roman 2020
the ending 😂 "STOP GET OUT THE EPISODE IS OVER punk u little punk"😂😂
virgil's changing eyeshadow at the end there gets me
I can just imagine the guy would collect more Disney pins and all and then Roman would keep making song references
Roman had freaking love hearts next to his head when talking to virgil... Prinxiety is official
Ah, cant relate. I'm an extrovert. and Aromantic. I don't know if those things go together.       Why am I watching this then..... my life never makes sense.
i love this vid its the best to many ads do
15:59 he look like Patton when he is running, no?
12:44 this scene made me feel things I've never felt before
No ones talking about the end whenever Virgil was excited and his eye shadow was purple but after Roman said they were ready for this his eye shadow changed and he looked upset and I’m now scared of what’s wrong 😅
The best part "I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay"
I think the artists ship prinxiety a little bit-
This Video Make Me Die Of Laught ^^ i like all your video Thomas
I wanted to scream while watching this SO many times. But I'm at WORK!!😆😆😆😆😆😆
This is deep
I relate to that last moment so hard. The priority of anxiety changing from fear of screwing something up, to fear of losing the chance at what your afraid of screwing up.
wait why did this make me so emotional-
MY HEART!!! MY INTERNAL SCREAMING!!! THE SQUEING!!! EEEEEEE!! WHY ARE GAY COUPLES FALLING IN LOVE SO CUTE!!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Is Thomas gay because I think he is some times because the way he talks and acts
I RE WATCHED IT AND ITS JUST AS GOOD T-T AHH
I'm glad my favorite side is in the video aka roman
Me watching this for the second time 11:03 did i miss a Jacksepticeye reference the first time aroubd???!!! *shooketh*
I want this as a Disney short 😁
T: ..... T: you saw me knock over that trash can didn’t you? N: that was you?! Are you ok?? Me: *no*
"I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay!"  I smiled so hard
I just realized out of no where orange usually represents determination so does that mean the new side is determination
but like the PRINXIETY AHHHH
10:33 OF OUR NEW NATION!
Virg had light purple dark spots not black spots 😊😊
Idk if I'm just emotional because I haven't seen any of my friends in 6 months or what, but that ending made me cry happy tears :')
IS NO ONE GONNA RECOGNIZE VIRGILS EYESHADOW WHEN HES HAPPY???!
He has stickers on his laptop  Gay hahahahahah
THAT'SSO BEAUTIFUL I'M CRYING SO MUCH AAAAA I LOVE YOU THOMAS
Prinxiety moments is there too~~
17:09 is my favourite plus the part when the ultimate ship of Virgil x Roman like YESS VIRGIL
PRINCXIETY CHECK!
At the end, notice who Virgil looks at. He doesn't look at Thomas, he looks at Roman. He looks at Roman's face and realises how upset he was. Virgil was willing to take that risk for *Roman* . And how his face lights up when Roman touches his shoulder to say "Bravery". He was happy when Roman was happy. Virgil is literally the embodiment of anxiety, but he went against everything he stands for so Roman could be happy. Just let that sink in.   Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.
I would love to see more animatics in the future, this was so much fun to watch
Completely off topic, but on the subject of Janus, Did anybody else notice that the outfits they wore in Hamilton in the gun shot scene between Burr and Hamilton kinda looked like Janus' outfit? I just finished watching Hamilton for the first time and that was what passed through my head, so I wanted to share it with fellow Fanders to see if you guys agree. :T
I really enjoyed this .
20:11 I love Roman's expression after Thomas tells him to leave. He's such a cute lil' troll, lol!
When Thomas said his ego was bruised Roman should have like acted like he was in pain because in the video "My Negative Thinking" Roman said everything hurt because Thomas was feeling really insecure after the audition and said his ego was bruised
The end of the video with Roman and Virgil getting along and the purple eyeshadow makes me happy stim so much I just go back and watch this video when I need an extra boost I have no idea why it does this to me but just screeching
Will Janus and Remus be in the intro at some point?
PRINXITY
Virgil=gay panic
An XXX-pert.  Ummmm
I'm SQUEALLLLLIIIIIIING
Nobody gonna talk about the Blink-182 joke that he made! That was such a great setup!
Janus I swear if you ruin this relationship Roman and Virgil worked for I am going to get Patton and you won’t like it when he’s mad
The guy is scared he left uses the forgot your food distraction-THOMAS KISS HIM HE IS THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS JUST FLIPPING KISS HIM   This is while I’m paused  and at that moment
Im watching this right before waking my friend up by blasting the iphone alarms into her mic :)
Thomas: -does gay eyes- Youtube: SHAVING CREAM Me: But Thomas doesn't need to SHAVE!!!!!!!
i am gay to
The amount of gay energy pushes me off the bed
OMLLL PRINXIETY
ASDFGHJKLHSKSKSLSKSKKSKSKSKSKSKSKSK THIS IS SO CUTE
When I saw this thumbnail I didn’t know what to expect but as me wanting to be a future animator and writer, this was a VERY interesting, funny, and SUPER relatable for most of the people (I think) around the world! SUPER inspiring thank you for uploading this content, I’m sure some people that are watching this, they are being inspired to taking that extra step, for their future, in their personal life and career life, for sure. Continue your amazing work!                I hope you guys have a great night, afternoon, or morning, whenever and whoever is seeing and reading this comment😊
No one: At the end:Virgil, Roman,Thomas:”girls getting excited over someone”
Omg! This was amazing! I literally squealed at the wholesomeness at the end of the animation
I don’t know who I wanna hug more  The one who wants so much. But doesnt know what to want.  Or the one who wants to be ok with wanting something.
19:58 ROMAN THOSE HEARTS ARE NOT FOR PRIDE PIN DUDE I CAN TELL
Hello
How do I become a featured sanderside!
"shut up emo" lol i died
I dunno.....PLANT
I have a gay crush and I told my friend and I said, “I don’t know if she is gay tho” and they used the ‘We don’t know if their *not* gay’ argument on me.
Damn, anyone who doesnt have alter egos acting as their wing men are really missing out
HAH GAYYYYYYYY PRINCY AND VIRGIL
Roman: "Emphasis on the old." Thomas: "Stop! Get out! the episode over!"
Aww, Virgil cared about Roman.
Gay or Europin
i love how the animators made prinxiety so real- like the love hearts on romans face in the line "shut up, emo" alhgfwurghlwegrhulirhrilghelhur just food for me to feed off of
"We don't know if he's gay" "But we don't know if he's not gay"  THAT HIT DIFFERENT LMFAO
I had an asthma attack yesterday, and watching Thomas, Virgil and Roman freak out over Nico was worse for my lungs
Virgil's Eyeshadow changing to purple when he's giddy is a thing now and I love it.
Gonna go use the excuse of my birthday to join the Patreon
Virgil is like a woman  NEVER and I repeat NEVER tell them to relax.
PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END PURPLE EYESHADOW  VIRGY IS A HAPPY KIDDOOOOOO  AAAAAAAAAAAA
“If I’m making a mistake, I’ll aDD IT TO THE LIST” Why does that make me so so sad for Roman?
Yes, yes, please yes, live action yessssssss
Watched this with my girlfriend. This is almost exactly how I felt in the lead-up to me giving her a hand-written invitation to Pizza and a movie, as a date. (Neil Gaiman had that one right, it really is much easier to give writers a written invitation to let them know they're being asked out)
Does..Does Virgil know about last episode?
This honestly hit really close to home as a bisexual. I used to be a huge introvert (by my own volition because I was trying to be "emo" at that point) and back then I had plenty of people who fit my criteria to be "my type". Although, I could never talk with them because I kept overthinking everything I was going to say, just like in this episode. For example, I ended up with the perfect chance to talk with someone I liked and I ended up just blatantly answering the questions they had about their tech issues for a recording software we used in class. It was a rough start, but now I finally got myself figured out for once. This episode seriously made me reminiscent of back then, so I was laughing the whole way through. As always, amazing work, and I'm excited to see more really creative stuff like this in the future!
I left the video just before the live action scene the first time I watched it, SO I NEVER SAW VIRGIL'S MOTHER FREAKING PURPLE EYESHADOW, OH MY HOLY SHIFGHJZXVBBNM
iM nOt cRyInG sHaDdUp
I AM WATCHING THE BLACK LIST AND A CHEF JUST YELLED "OK GUYS GALS AND NON-BINARY PALS" !!! I CAN'T!
the words "Lair, Lies, Lie" are used like 30 times in this video and Deceit like once, Janus? WHERE ARE YOU!
I really like this
When it’s safe to go back to recording episodes instead of animating them, I want an episode where, instead of just popping up on screen, Vigil runs down the stairs.  For no real reason in particular, I just think it would be funny if Virgil ran down the stairs yelling, “NOPE, NOPE, NOT TODAY SATAN” At Janus or Remus  Edit: maybe he can even throw a shoe at them or something
All these comments bout the pintroverts and i just wanna know what nico asked thomas...
Did anyone else notice when Virgil was excited his eye shadow was purple but when he was anxious at 23:18 and 24:03 till the end of the video his eye shadow went back to black? Just me? Okay...
I love your videos and I respect all your choices in life.😊😃😀😁😄❤🧡💛💚💙💜
meanwhile flirting is the only thing I'm good at socially friends terrify me though
ITS A LOVE STORY BABY JUST SAY YES!!!!!!
Me: reading about the color changing eyeshadow of Virgil, getting confused, trying to see is but not finding where it does it* where did the others see it????
Maybe this is just me being dumb, but why at the beginning did it say Sanders A Sides?
gerard gay has deeply cut into my soul, this will scar me for the rest of my life.
Is this how my friend felt when I and my best friend spotted  cute guy for him to heck out
Rewatching this for the 1,000,000th time, I have a question. Why is Roman’s symbol a crown? I know he’s a prince but the crown isn’t his official symbol. Is he going to get a crown? Is it going to be like Patton’s cat hoodie, and someone gifts it to him? Am I reading to much into this?! Probably but this is going to be on my mind until the next episode comes out...
I loved this
You do not understand how many times I’ve re-watched this video.
The purple eyeshadow on Virgil is glitter and how it'll switch!! I love it!!
*Roman and vrgel having a gay panic*  Thomas :/
*Pure*       *PRINXIETYYYY*
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eye bags makeup change when he got happy
covid-19 ?
Virgil x Roman is now my otp
Dang it I miss the old you
I ship it so much omggg
BRO I WAS FAN GIRLING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭HIGH SQUEL
GERARD GAY
This had zero business being this frikin cute adjkdjk
I just started to like you and watching your oldest Vines!?
I have watched this quite a few times! It is Sanders sides and animation!! It takes two amazing things and puts them together into something godlike. And it is gay! Ahhhhhh!!! This is to good for my brain to comprehend
DO YOU STILL DO MAIL OPENINGS/RECIEVE FANMAIL? ID LIKE TO KNOW SO I CAN SEND STUFF
Yesss this was AMAZING life just hits hard :)
Also: "I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" like that was amazing I screamed😂
My heart!! How did this so quickly become my favorite episode?!?
I just realized that when Sander sides end, that means Thomas' dilemmas against himself ends as well. Meaning, he's gotten his life put together.  And when that day comes, we should be happy for the person Thomas has become 💕
Roman x Virgle
Is it just me or is it weird that Virgil and Roman, Anxiety and Creativity, are the ones complaining about Thomas lying instead of Patton, aka MORALITY?
VIRGIL. BLUSHED!!!! THE SHIP!!!! THE GAY!!!! Thomas you're amazing!!!
Did anyone notice at the end Virgil had purple eyeshadow, when he was panicking about the guy.
I'm a lesbian and I wish I had a girlfriend but most people in my area / school are  A: straight   B: hate me (I hath been labeled the weird kid)   C: having a relationship at my age is pointless because they don't know how to relationship
I love this ! <3
Dude the girl I like wanted me to watch this so I just binged watched the entire series and omg this is so good!!!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY!
Hi Thomas friend Jessica
Me: Ihave been laughing this entire time.   I have no regrets- Also me: *Pointing out every Prinxiety Moment to show my family who doesn’t care *  Also ALSO me: *Yelling to everyone in my house * PRINXIETY IS VERY MUCH CANON AND NOTHING IS CHANGING MY MIND
Anyone else crying. Just me. Okay. Imma go cry in a corner now ♥️
I took a kind of break from watching sanders sides for a while and BOY WHAT AN EPISODE TO COME BACK TO! it just keeps getting better and better
The only thing missing from this video is...  PATTON AND LOGAN SERIOUSLY WHERE ARE THEY?!?!!??!?!?!?  Srsly tho, LOVE Roman and Virgil's friendship here. It definitely made sense to focus on them because the heart and anxiety r 100% the two biggest factors in stuff like this but...  I can HEAR Patton making dad jokes whilst Thomas is building up the courage to make a move, and I can FEEL myself wanting to drag Logan away as he brings up all the statistics of why it's a bad idea, which just fuels Virgil's anxiety...
Is noticing someones pins and walking up to them to talk about their pins cause you like their pins really that weird?
So whenever Virgil's Happy or Excited, his eyebags becomes purple.
22:34 is me every time I watch this video...😂😂😂
Awwwwwwwwwwww 🥺
I was screaming from happiness and this cuteness 🥺😅
"youre missing the point."      we dont know if hes *not* gay
I got an ad with the name delion sanders and I just thought awww how cute it worked out!!!
I still wanna know what he asked him
I have a theory that the guy from the bathroom is gonna make a come back as the second lover
I don't get the intro joke, I don't get the correlation between Thomas' name and the verb and verb implication and it makes me sad
22:36 same
Rewatching the video and realizing the paralells between 0:00 and 18:30
As a Prinxiety shipper this had me full on gay panicking (especially 19:33 - 20:05 )
The eyeshadow changes!!! A shiny purple that switches back to normal black. AAAAHHHH!!!!!!! Also how much of this is scripted or is it based on real events in Thomas's life? Cause I'm not sure.
Asdfffndkshsgvsjdnd IM CRYING WTF????
Oh. My God. I love this too much😍 I now know what heaven feels like.
the second hand embarrassment causes me physical pain
Oh my gosh- he's name is N i c o * screaming in pjo  *
Is anyone noticing that Virgil’s eye bags shifts to purple when excited or black when he’s back to normal. I absolutely loooove that detail🖤
THIS IS SO CUTE I 😍✨🤣👀😌👀💗🦋💖😂💗😭✨💀😌👁😌😃✨💗👀😌😭💗😭💀💖✨💀💗❤️🦋😃💗😍👀😃💗💕😭🤣😂👁💖🌙✨🤠😂🦋😂😍😌👀🦋✨👑😂😃💗😃😃👀🤣😃❤️💗🤣✨👑
my entire life explained
THAT WAS ADORABLE
10:07 LMAO GERARD GAY--
did you end up with him ??????
Thomas is this your way of telling us you might have s boyfriend😊      Bye the way I love your videos
this is prinxiety fuel and i'm here for it
I love it! Really, this is one of the best episode you've ever done. The animation was sooo beautiful. You have amazing artists on your lines.
6:55 Y’know what they say! If your nervous EAT FOOD! I got that from a meme for the krew.
2:24 if you want to skip past the intro 🙃
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNED SHINY AND PURPLE WHEN HE WAS EXCITED AT THE END
Can I just point out how Virgil used his anxiety for good by making Thomas anxious to miss the opportunity instead of anxious to seize the opportunity?  All in all, this was adorable
"I so so badly want this, Im desperate for it. But you cant have true love if the relationship isn't built on truth. If this is the foot we start out on, what's it gotta be like down the road?"
16:30 Thomas knew what the future would hold!
I dunno why but this series is something IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIBBBBB<Csoreifhn ,x.wq['fr
"...what are gay eyes?" oh honey, it's how you and Roman looked each other up and down when your outfits changed.
Wait am I the only one who realized this, now this might be a stretch idk but at the end of the video when they come home and they were all excited I noticed that Virgil's eye shadow was purple and when he got scared by the dog and by the looks of it was second guessing if they're ready for a relationship his eye shadow turned back to black. So I'm thinking that purple eye shadow= excited type of anxiousness and black= neutral(?)/bad anxiousness. So like I'm wondering if I'm right how many times of Virgil having the black eye shadow was it for a negative reason and how much was it just a neutral just wearing it reason? Or like am I just overthinking this or does it mean smth else. idk just a random late at night thought I had
😭😭😭tears of joy, beautiful, fantastic 😄
Me watching the animatic:*on the verge of tears* Me after the animatic:*spamming the subscriber button because it was beautiful until it lets me because I have too many subscriptions*
💜: “That’s cyberstalking. But irl” ❤️:“Sooooo stalking?” Virgil is such a mood-
Mm, salt
CAN YOU DO A SANDERS SIDES REACT PLEAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watch Thomas be amazing at flirting in the beginning 🤣🤣🤣
I love watching you because I could tell my crush that I was gay and that I liked him without fear. You are such a good gay person idol in my opinion.
The fact I was nearly crying at one point
I would love to see you play this out Thomas! This is awesome! I loved seeing Virgil... I missed him!
IEJFNWENCEWF NWOCILOF 3QCE OIR CO IO I LOVE THIS
After a lot of depressed, music, self-hatred, self-homophobia, stress eating, confusion and YouTube, I have found a label that I am very comfortable with-        Pintrovert.
Idk if I’m the only one that ships Rogil
Oml my first thought from seeing the title was just     o h   n o
THOMAS YOU'RE A LEGEND
19:51-20.00  prinxiety shippers:*fangirls/boys*
Roman with heart eyes lives rent-free in my brain 🥺🙏
i think prinxiety is growing!!!
MADE. ME. CRY. :(
what a good day to be a prinxiety shipper
I LOVE IT !!!!!!
“Thomas I’m gonna need you to shake your hands, ya gotta do somethin’ with em” I felt that
Wheres logan or the other one?
This is unfortunately the most relatable thing I've ever seen
Beautiful just beautiful
WAIT HOLD ON HOW IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT EXCITED VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW  THIS MAN GETS BETTER AND BETTER LOOK AT HIM
Oh hey look it's the "I'm not partaking in group activities while Mr Snekky Snek is at the table" club!  _I fear the next episode oh Lord_
Ok but the way virgil blushed at romans compliment like their relationship is growing to be so pUREE
Roman: Gay eyes? Thomas: Gay eyes. Virgil: W-what are gay eyes? Me, a non intellectual: *screams* gay eyes gay eyes gay eyes-
I’m like Virgil :’D my definition is ~{aNxIeTy}~ :’3
*CORONAVIRUS.*
Was I the only one who noticed they said what the hell twice in this video
Love the animatic. Would also love another “Sanders asides“ whenever you’re up for it :-)
omg i love this!!!!
Totally didn't almost cry!!
Somtimes yea mostly I wish my name WASE’NT roman
Omg... not even nine seconds in and I'm laughing. My dog heard the barking and started barking out the window!!
I sincerely hope I signed up fast enough for the shirt. I'm sorry Thomas but once I get the shirt, I'm probably going to drop the donation down to like $10 or $15...... Maybe... We'll see if I remember
Did anyone else notice how Roman was kinda trying to also be Morality? Like some parts he just generally says something Patton would probably say  9:21 for example (I'll list more when I find more) The "try speaking from the heart" (Ik this is in a romance cenario and Roman is the romance guy but still)
The change of Virgil's eyeshadow at the end. That's so fricking cute
0:28 the music that starts here is feeling alright by gavin luke
I WANT TO BE A PINTROVERT 🥺
Dude.... When the guy came out of the bathroom stall I could've died. Oh my gosh...🤭😱
Imagine people seeing Thomas talk to himself because they can’t see Roman and Virgil-
the ship is coming together yay
ah yes, gay eyes.
I know Logan isnt in this, but its Nov.3rd. Happy B-Day Logan!!!!!
That was so cute
Are you dating someone ahhh
So happy
lovely :)
So um who else feels REALLY called out by this? lol
"YEAH! Join me! NO THINKING!" is my life's motto
*Me screaming like a monkey when they talked to each other* My mom: Who tf let a demon in the house
This was so cute
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOGAN 🎂🥳🎉🥳🎂
If only i had anxiety that would push me to talk to someone i like
Its about time 😊
Watching this because my crush turned out to be straight
Is this a reference to DID? Or just simply self conscious, anxiety, etc
Can we please see Logan’s room😁😁😁😁😁
I know I’m late but THAT WAS AMAZING (hint of prinxiety was in there)
OMG PARAMOREEEEEEEE and omg this made me cry
i love this its amazing your amazing thomas also i have a tiny question.... is purple eyeshadow the more optemestic Virgil?
Niko seeing Thomas standing up and sitting down like someone's pulling him: uuuuuuuuuuuuh
I love the animation in this vid.
The restroom scene made me cry. I'm so gay.   DUDE NOOO THE GUY THAT APPEARED ON THE BATHROOM 😂😂😂
"It's like cyber stalking buy irl" "... so stalking?"  "OH!! RIGTH!!"
THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL! AHH I LOVED IT! THIS NEEDS TO BE A MOVIE!
ROMAN AND VIRGIL ARE SO FUCKING CUTE TOGETHER
... god I'm gonna cry YOU DID AN ANIMATIC??!?!?!??! OMG OMG TAKE MY MONEY TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY IM GONNA CRY THIS IS SO GREAT god!!! The quantity of effort put into this AAAHHH IM FANGIRLING SO BAD
"Gay or nay" AH YES THE LGBTQ EXPERIENCE 😂😂😂😂😂
i think this makes more sense in an animatic. Like with animation/art you can do so much more than you'd normally be able to do irl. Like you'd probably have to rent a mall or film while it's open and it'd just cost a lot
My friend tells me I'm just like Roman.
This restores my faith in humanity.
I know I'm gonna sound dumb. But can you do a sanders sides episode on Among Us?
I need live adaptation please and thank you.
I just yelled the word “falsehood” at my dad when he said that he’s never been drunk.........I’ve been watching too much sanders sides
omg prinxity shippers made this episode an i love it srdfydvfygeywubfheuyv **other sounds of shipping**
Someone needs to show Virgil the Sanders Sides self-inflicted achromatic animation
"HE FEARS THINGS TOO??!?!?!?!" Bless Virgil
"An X X X - pert." "Easy, tiger." Ahj-eh- mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
19:38.... IT SMELLS LIKE A SHIP SAILING
I saw Virgil purple eyeshadow and I screamed like omg so cute like i was with my sister and we like screamed together like oh my God
Im barely at 14:03 and Im about to cry, so so beautiful
W-was Virgil's eye shadow purple or am i just seeing things
You should sell signed merch not just to like lucky people but in general and take some of the money and donate it to help frontline workers who are working and trying to help with Covid and stuff lol
I'm crying😭. That was beautiful.
I'm with Roman in the bathroom part. eww. wash your hands you animal
Что делать Русских субтитров нет
are we not talking about virgils eye shadow changing depending on his mood or-
Yay
Can someone explain why he said there was obvious reasons for the delay?
im watching from the playlist so im confused, is this the last episode on youtube? if it is ima cri-
why has he not have ben uploading for the past 2 months?
22:59 i LOVE how virgil's eyeshadow immediately turns black, im a sucker for detail so i love it
Loved this Sanders Asides video (all of them really), but could someone please explain to me what deceit Virgil and Roman were talking about in 15:35? What it looked like to me was that Thomas freaked out and did a bunch of ridiculous things, but it didn't look as if he was trying to deliberately trick anyone. But Virgil and Thomas said that all those things meant he was potentially basing the relationship on a lie ("Will deceit be the answer to all your problems?")? Or am I just misreading this, and Thomas in his anxiety is calling himself deceitful when he isn't? :P
"you're a creep, you're a weirdo, what the hell are we doing here?" it cant be that only I noticed that, right?
Yep. Anxiety is 100% the one who would do that.
Yoo is Mr. Flores a real person causeee Nvm its Joan but they cool toooo I hope Thomas finds a Mr. Flores irl too!
Ok but what would've happened if one of the stickers on the laptop was sanders sides merch
*idunno plant*
that was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
there's more to the fight or flight thing it's fight, flight, freeze, faint knowing this I think it would be funny if Thomas is put in a high-stress moment and Virgil just faints              idk if this is funny, just thought it would be.
“I dunno.. plant..”  Me. Literally me.
Ending left me in tears ;v;
Thomas then that technically means. Janus owns the entire Patreon. 😍
THIS MADE ME CRY! IM SOBBING RIGHT NOW! It’s so beautiful. I can die a happy pansexual now
I now identify as a PINTROVERT
I love how Virgil's eye shadow becomes bright purple and sparkly when he's excited. So cute!
I cant wait for yall to adress the fact that virgil was a dark side...
Yay another episode
OMG THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!
Virgil: “ exactly....no.”
I'm starting a religion where we worship Virgil Sanders.   We basically pick a time of day to say "We are too emotionally unstable for duty," and he accepts our statement.   Every day, we worship Virgil by quoting him at least once. And, instead of saying "thank God" we say "Thank Virgil's smirk and bangs!"  Oh, and instead of saying "amen" we say "aww we think you're hot."
THAT WAS ADORABLE and also very educational with flirting, there's a girl I like but idk if she likes girls, I just should make sure not to lie to her. Thanks, you're awesome.
FUNALLY YESH
As a Virgil kinnie.. this episode STRESSED me <3
Virgil: It's like Cyber stalking but real life  Roman: So... Stalking  Virgil: OHH YOU'RE RIGHT  Dead 😂😂😂
☹️
Hey thomas whut do you personaly ship between the sides i would really like to know i have bo ships for your sides i want them to be true
i literally died watching this because i want SOOOOO badly to meet someone and i  practically squealed when they started talking to each other!!!!
I loved I loved it I lovvvvvvvveeed iiiiiiiiit so much thank you and please do more
you *know* what you're doing sanders! you know shippers are watching!
My ship!!!!!!!!!
Has anyone noticed that when Virgil gets happy his eyeshadow under his eyes turns purple
I’ve never related more to anything before in my life
Thomas: *runs away from socializing “but... plant” Thomas (Virgil): Go home and regret everything   Me: I relate to these on a spiritual level, I am not joking
𝘐 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘰 𝘮𝘶𝘤𝘩 LMAO 😂
vines is the best
why is nobody talking about the last scene after the outro???  Virgil with the purple eyeshadow AAAAAAAAAAAAA
19:48 Me: **starts crying in shipper**
What are the odds that virgil is also impulse? Or like anxiety mixed with impulse? Idk or it could be the anxiety acting on it? I feel like there is a lot of stuff we see from him this so we tend not to get
Wait is he gay or bi or straight i can't tell
Virgil and roman looking at thomas: Roman:I RAISED THAT BOY.
Aww I really loved this!!! 💕🙏
Bravo. Thank u.
please give us more prinxiety! thankyou.
"YOU WERE TESTING ME?!!!" "No, *I* wasn't testing you, I was just *paniking* "
I randomly typed "Gay" into youtube search and this was the third result.
Who else noticed at the end of the video Virgil's eyeshadow was purple
"Flirting with Social Anxiety" <shows Virgil and Roman in the thumbnail>     *Jesus, I can already hear the Prinxiety shippers coming this way*
The ending scene literally explains my emotions throughout the entire animatic
Roman + Virgil Anyone????    I loves the "Shut up emo" At the end it was soooo cute
If I ever do cosplay, I am cosplaying as a girl version of virgil or Roman
You are so funny . You always make my day
*Panik* *Even more panik*
19:58   Just do it like just kiss DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT WOULD BE?! I’m sorry I am a proud prinxiety shipper and the title had me QUAKING so that scene killed me!
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA
iunno plant
Anyone else think The Good Place would good reference for these dilemmas?
Ya’ll have no idea how hard this video was to watch for me without randomly pausing during the really awkward parts cause it took me at least 30 mins to fully watch the video. The second hand awkwardness is real
Awwwww
I wanna see the sanders sides play among us- I can already see how it would go sondeowosjs  Patten would be the imposter that never kills and when someone ask him he would be like “well I- ya see- ITS ME ITS ME I KILLED HIM I WILL NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN” and just be the purest crewmate- I know his color would be cyan but he has such pink energy and you can’t tell me I’m wrong Virgil would be the silent crewmate who actively avoids everyone and would be to anxious to be imposter or honestly be a master at it and would kill Roman first but keep Patten alive lol  Logan would be the great detective crewmate and also an amazing imposter but he would be the type of imposter that flat out says “I’m imposter” and no one would believe him- Roman would be the one to start an entire fake romance with one of their fellow crewmates actively keeping watch for the imposter when their buddy is doing a task screaming “I shALL PROTECT THEEE” or something like that Janus would obviously be the best imposter as a master of tricks and lies, mastering the ability to slowly get the crewmates voted out and win the game, he would also be a master crewmate being able to point out the slightest sign of someone trying to *deceive*  Remus would probably be the memer that screams “red is sus” red being Roman:/ Idk why but that just fits in my mind
Nico?  *A man runs up* *YOU BASTARD!*
Getting mad Cecil and Carlos vibes from this lol
GAYyYyYyyYyYyYYyYyYyYyY BOIIiIiiI
OMG Thomas is so CUTE in this animatic!
At the end Virgil's eyeshadow goes from sparkling purple when he's happy to his usual dark eyeshadow when he's upset, and since we've seen that sides can change over time (i.e. Remus and Roman splitting into two), the same thing is going to happen to Virgil. Here's my theory:   We know Virgil started out as a dark side, (he was probably Paranoia because in the episode 'Intrusive Thoughts', Logan almost calls Virgil paranoid before correcting himself, this causes Virgil and Patton to become quiet) I think something happened to Thomas that made Virgil become Anxiety, (maybe Patton took Virgil in which caused Virgil to become more tame because he had someone positive in his life to teach him right from wrong. This would explain why he and Patton have a father-son relationship) But when he stopped being Paranoia, this caused him to enter the emo phase we see him in now.   Then the gang accepted him in the episode 'Is Anxiety Good?' and showed they weren't scared of him anymore in the Halloween episode, (and in the Halloween episode, Virgil says although he's gone through phases, those phases are a part of him, so him being an emo could be another phase he's going through, further proving that him being Anxiety is a phase he'll grow out of) and Virgil has been shown to be more mature and responsible than he was in the first couple of episodes, (Like when he makes Thomas rehearse before a performance or in this episode when he forced Thomas to talk to Nico)   So with all of that being said, I predict in the next episode Virgil will debate weather or not he's ready for this new relationship with Nico, battling with his past with being Paranoia and his present with being Anxiety. And in the end, he'll realize that he's ready and his journey from being a dark side to being a good side will become full-circle and he'll transform into...Excitement!   *Bonus theory: most sides have animals that represent them, Patton is a frog, Janus is a snake, and Remus is an octopus. Virgil's animal is a spider as seen from his room and because arachnophobia is a common fear, (his animal being a spider is probably left over from his time as Paranoia, so back then Virgil probably used spiders to scare Thomas) so I predict when he becomes Excitement, his animal will go from a spider to a butterfly! (Because y'know, "butterflies in your stomach". And because butterflies go through phases: larvae, caterpillar, and butterfly, mirroring Virgil going from Paranoia to Anxiety to Excitement! Which would be cute (◍•ᴗ•◍))*   Also, Remus will probably be in the next episode and will force Virgil to think about not being ready and his time as Paranoia, *(Because in Remus' first episode, he wanted to make Virgil become Paranoia again by causing Thomas to have intrusive thoughts. We see this when Remus becomes happy when Logan points out that Virgil was being the problem and Remus threatening Logan when he tried calming Virgil down by using logic.) This is Remus' master plan, undoing the gang's progress by making everyone become a dark side and as a result, making Thomas a deranged lunitic. The reason? Because he was abandoned by Thomas and wants revenge.* But coming back to Virgil, this causes Virgil to battle with his past or perhaps turn into a spider like how Patton turned into a frog in the Redux episode. Either way, the next episode is going to be _very_ interesting...
Oof ouch my heart- *Collapses*     In all seriousness though I loved that
prinxiety shippers: ITS HAPPENING!!! ITS HAPPENING!!!
This Man defines yolo
Why does this call me out so much?
As anybody notice Virgil's eye shadow was purple when he was in a good mood in the end, then it turned back to black when he was scared. That was pretty cool thomas, I liked that detail very much
gaaaaaaaaaaaaay heehenoice
Sorry if this is too personal, but is this based on a true story?
Who else wants to see a live action version but can't get the patreon TvT
I loved the entire video, but can we just talk about that so pretty purple shimmer under virgil's eyes at the end?!?! Its so pretty!!! What did you use???
Ok, I have a homophobic family, and because of that I was very self hating and had a bunch of build up internalized homophobia. After years of struggling, I finally came to terms with my sexuality about a year ago, and have finally accepted myself for who I am. So, since I'll probably never be able to come out to any of my family, and even if I did get the courage too, they wouldn't accept me and tell me to go through conversion, I decide to come out here. Sooooo Hia. My name is Mo. I'm bi and have girlfriend that I love very much. We are both very closeted, and I'm just happy that I can at least come out like this, even though I don't know any of you. It's just nice to know that not everyone is hateful.   so yeah. that's all :))
Not me crying
Hey Thomas, I have been watching your content for quite awhile. And my fiance has also watched your content. We have very much enjoyed yous SanderSides videos most. I see him as Logan because he looks at everything logically you can even ask him. He says I am Roman... Which I guess I can see. The reason I am writing this to you right now is because we are getting married later on today. Yes we are having a Halloween wedding. Yea that is just how we are. Thank you for all the content you make and keep up the hard work.
I friggen loved this!! It was so cute and omg I ship it EEEEEEEEE!! I love the story and voice acting and just ahghhghh everything is perfect!!
That ending was NOT ok.....you were just tauting everyong one with such a cute little princiety moment .....AHHHHH
Be pausing cuz i wanted to gag at the cringe but also cuz its so whole i didnt want to miss anything
Kinddaa love that but r.i.p the garbage can
Are we going to ignore the intro in which the dog barked every time Thomas was obviously going to say rough and a dog's bark is sometimes written as "ruff"
You need to make a live action version of this!
I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO CATCH FEELINGS FROM A THOMAS SANDERS VIDEO
Me- I can finally relate to the non-binary pals *sniff* I now have the bravery to be able to say, I will join you!
😥😩🏳️‍🌈so beautiful
I knew someone was in the restroom 😂😂
so ya that last part is a thing...yay.
sTOPP my emotionnnns- I was kinda sad (because empathy-) with the last episode, and now I'm full of fluffyness w h y I'm confused about this mood swing I had, and I'm even starting to ship Prinxiety- I- welp, since I'm in this fluffy mood and Patton wasn't in this episode, it is time for me to search Logicality fanfictions or even some other ships, still with only fluff-
People thought Thomas talking to himself in his living room...   Now Thomas in public talking to himself
I actually started to tear up a bit. Nice work :)
The prinxiety shipers are going to EAT THIS UPP lol
I loved this it was funny 🙄
Thomas: nothing but a brused ego  Roman: mmm.
Idk why but when i think of virgil i think of shadow the hedgehog ●~●
I had a big happy smile by the end. This video was amazing and my mouth hurts
THIS IS PRINXIETY
This video had me cringing but in a good way if that makes sense??? I loved the video, but I can easily put myself into other people's shoes so it felt as if I was the one bein in a gay panic kfnfjfdnjdjf- anyways! great video!!! ^^
Is no one going to talk about virgil's eyeshadow going purple to black after he gets kinda anxious after Thomas says "are we ready for this"
Waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait. I didnt know thomas was gay!!!! THIS IS FRICKING A. MAZ. ING!!!!!!!!!! Also this is frickin hilaroius!!!! He is such a good comedian!!! Also I probs should a picked up he was gay from the ships between the sides lol. I'm stoopid TwT
**cough cough** _better as an animatic_
Tell me I'm not the only one who saw that shiny purple eyeshadow for Virgil -w-
Nico: Mister Flores  My Brain: Mom! someone in my father´s family is in a video!  ... and yeah, this is really bad, sorry.
I understand Virgil eyeshadow when's he's happy it turns purple when he's more on the dark side of things he it turns back to black
wait, are we going to see fusion emotions next??, like Virgil and Roman turn into bravery? or disgust and deceit turn into revelations the compression of darkness and viewer of light? ( the reason for that last one is because of when Tomas said Janis the first time i swore he said Genesis).
Bruh this is me everyday lol
Virgil: it's like cyber stalking... But real life Roman: so.... stalking Virgil: OH YOUR RIGHT!!
Omg a happy ending!
I'm so happy virgil had courage to push you forward Thomas. GO GET YOUR MANS!
everyone is shipping roman and virgil and whatever but what if we shipped like roman with Nico's anxiety or like virgil with nico's creativity?
17:19 Is it just me, or was that LITERALLY an anxiety attack?
In which roman and virgil work together to tag team Thomas all day.
"YEAH YEAH ILL HAVE THE UHH...- BOILED MAYO CARROTS-" iM eVaPorAtiNg-
There just had to be a episode about love with Virgil and Roman only hUH 😭
*10:58**-**11:08* Oh! There I am! XD
This triggered my anxiety and I love it
This made me cry, i just realised....if thomas is gay so is his sides too, income the prinxiety shippers
Thomas throughout the whole thing was dying from gay panic
That poor dude in the stall tho
You can’t use information you snooped for, that’s like cyber stalking but real life! So... stalking? OH YOUR RIGHT!
Virgil: "Will deceit Be the Answer to all your Problems..?" Janus: HEY B*TCHES- Virgil: N O -  Janus: ಥ‿ಥ
GAY
Cute guy: well let’s no waste this one    Roman: shut uup  Virgil:shut up     Roman: shut uup
Virgil: Thats like cyberstalking...but in real life. Roman: So stalking..? Virgil: OH YOUR RIGHT!  (ThAt Was JuSt TO sWeEt I LoVe thIs so fRiCkINg MuCH!!!
I don’t have money tho😭
Wait are you becoming gay
F**king me
When you feel like Ro-man _with an R_ and Vergil were talking to you-
Is dating this hard? Damn
Oh my gay heart...
Um anyone else see the epic prinxity moment or what
I need more of this 😱
I wish i could join the patreon but i have no money being to young to have a job😳😑
What about that eyeshadow? Did you lost the pencil while filming or is it, like, an excited Virgil thing?
1. Thomas, did you get a boyfriend?and  2. I cant be the only one that saw Roman x Virgil at 17:05 when Thomas and Roman were upset  and 19:40 when Roman said thx to Virgil, am I the only one?
Don’t ask just look up the Roman legend of Romulus and Remus  If this is what he intended then I actually appreciate something from history class.
I love Virgils glittery eye makeup in the end bit
' Thats like cyber stalking, But in real life! '   ' So stalking '   Virgil : Deep thought   ' ... OH YOUR RIGHT- '
"hooray, who's gay?" *lifts hand like I'm in class*
I loved this so muchhhhh but the second hand jitters kept making me pause the video XD SO GOOD Y'ALL
holy cow is virgils eyeshadow going to change based on his mood. i love that
I loved it, I cried TvT
Are you still making videos on YouTube??? I can't afford Patreon membership lol don't have any money
Y'all don't seem to be talking about how Virgil was happier and calmed cause his eye-shadow went from black to purple, but every time something scared him or made him doubt what was happening it went back to black
i love this animation
At frame 19:54 why did you put that in your video? You're only encouraging the toxic shipping fandom in your community.
"What are you doing?"    Idunno...plant.. *He said, in a depressing voice*  Plant. That will be my reason for everything I do now.  *Plant.*
Im crying
10:44 "idk plants"
pls say yes
r u still posting ? :)))
I need the soundtrack for this-
Man I love it that wss a cute story
CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Is everyone else going to ignore the fact that Thomas has A LEGO DISNEY CASTLE!!?!!
Random cute guy: exists Roman: https://youtu.be/ukAYm8eybBg
Totally unrelated, but Thomas did you know that theres an atla fan musical? I’m currently obsessed with it and I know it by heart lol. It’s made by Katherine Lynn-Rose and some of her friends and you should check it out.   Playlist with all of the songs from it(plus one random atla song that’s not in it): https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnmJj_k-y-HqlZ4zvDUeDk3NHiz5pBHEe
Oh  My  God  I started crying while watching this video, the animation made me feel like I was watching a movie, just the feels!  I feel like giving you a digital hug.   OMG, this is so good!!! 😲😭😭😭💙💙💙💙
Teachneclly if any of the sides of sanders had a baby would that make narcissism?
_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA_
I have the exact same lego castle in the background lol
He did
oh my God Thomas
Me thinking the whole video: please tell me he got a boy friend XD but anyways good video stay safe and have a good day
This is something that I like to call gay panic lmao
Roman: "What are you doing" Thomas: "I dunno... plant"
AHHHHHHH VIRGIL HAS NEW EYESHADOW
Who would've thought that Roman would make a good anxiety as well
HIS EYE SHADOW IS PURPLE!!!!!!!
this was well done and don't worry thomas I'm 34 so you're not old.
Lowkey, the animation made this vid much more amazing. I like the dialogue and the animation that matched it well. I like the Sanders Sides when it is live action, but I also really like this too lol.
"I dunno, plant" -Thomas Sanders 2020
*When you said it was animation I was very very* _very_ *excited, this was great! My favourite part is when he crawled into the bin and when then guy came out thinking he was talking to him*
Can you do one on dating or going on a date? I really am lacking in the dating department.
im not crying... uh-Oh UhH Shut up
Hello
Me, an introvert, looking over the dozens of pins and stickers on everything around me: Oh no-
I really wanna meet you in person. So creative and cute
R u actually gay ?
I was not ready for the sheer amount of cute from Virgil in this.
Please tell me this is real life
Call a ambulance I think my heart actually just exploded
Oml I knew about Virgil’s mood changing eyeshadow in the animatic BUT I DIDN’T REALISE IT AT THE END!!
PRINXIETY PROUD OF THEIR BABBYYY
I have literally no idea why but Diem (one of my mediums) absolutely loved this video. He is normally like a dull dude and likes nothing 😂
Where is your vines
You should do this in real life when it is safe! I love it
Is it just me or is the Roman x Virgil ship sailing? :D
The way Virgil looked at Roman being sad and then shoving Thomas 🥺👉👈
How is Thomas 30 years old? He looks at most 20.
Why can't I be like this
I screaming right now szkdjnkcjsdnksdc
Awwww this is awkward and soo cute
thomas in the bathroom
question; where can i find virgils hoodie like what he wears in the videos?
*Pride Flag wave INTENSIFIES*
tumblr lied to me. i thought virgil and roman were gonna kiss smh
10:07 “i hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay” favorite quote thank you
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait....   thomas said this episode is important for the overall storyline... think it has something to do with Virgil at the end???
*Happy shipping sounds*
You should play D&D with your sides and have them each make a character and be in one party and try to have them actually complete one Quest I feel like Remus would try to murder everyone on site and I'm including the dark sides in this the dark and light sides must play together it would be amazing
Okay but are we not gonna talk about how Virgil’s eye shadow changed? Especially whenever it’s like good nervousness it’s purple and when it’s bad it’s black. jajdjejjrr I love that so much
I kid you not, I started crying at “well....let’s not waste this one.”
I think the animatics are better than live action
ITS TIME
5:18 . THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY I LOVE THAT SONGSKSJS
Can we take audio from your videos and make animation videos ourself?
Prinxiety all the way XD the end there is just- too perfect- like is it a cannon ship is it not? I want to be Eeeeeeee **fangirling intensifies**
I am crying tears of happiness.
Thomas should be like the disney princess who is controlled by her thoughts and say the darksides are the villains, and it could be the first LGBTQ+ disney movie-
roman and vigil at 20:00 : parent momtent  me: WOW THEY GAY THEY GAY THEY GAY AAAAAAAAA-
Omg love it so much!!! Almost cried!!! 💕💕💕
Virgil in this story is just the equivalent of ✨GAY PANIC✨
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH ROMAN AND VIRGIL
I wish for more!
my little gay prinxiety loving heart flipped out ;-;
Okay so I’m losing my mind like I can’t tell if this story is real, fake or WHATEVER you just need to tell me if it’s real or fake Thomas TELL ME NOW
This is sooo cool I want more anamatics like these 😁
19:50   A SHOULDER TOUCH I REPEAT WE HAVE A SHOULDER TOUCH
Nobody:   The guy he was afraid to talk to: I'm writing a song about me being a TrAsHbAg
Me: a social disaster  Cute girl: you should be just said hi  Me: (flips a table) I KNOW RIGHT?!?
PlAnTs
Me: (plans heartfelt speech)  Mind: pff check out this fool  Me, trying to do the speech in front of crush: Hi. Bye.
You're gonna have to speak from the heart.  My heart: OOOOH I DO I DO I DO I DOOOOO
Crush: what are you doing?  Me: I...Uh... *p  l  a  n  t*
The sheer *a c c u r a c y*
Ok but imagine you're just chilling in a mall and you see someone had left their food behind, so you went to find them.You do this, find out it's a cute gender you are attracted to, then that they also liked you. And THEN they were a famous youtuber. Bro I'd be losing my mind. This is amazing!
What sucks about seeing a hot girl in public is not knowing if they are straight or lesbian. The straight girls are dressing like some of the gays are are confusing my gaydar
Thank you for making this Thomas. This hit so close to my life and it's so nice to know that I'm not alone in the whole gay and socal anxiety aspect of life. It's so hard to put yourself out there like that but the content you make gives hope and confendence to people like me to people like us thank you so much. ❤
Oh my god this is so adorible I cried a bit 😭❤
I don’t know if he is gay or not but this video makes me think he may
If this gets any cuter my face is going to burst open and I’m smiling so much
This might be off topic, but I kinda want to see like an animated thing of them and what they would do in the zombie apocalypse.Something like their morals get put to the test like would they save someone else or themselves ,help one person out and put everyone else at risk,would they give food to someone or them you know.And all the sides and him talk about it,stuff like that! it all just ties into a lesson about making mistakes or being a leader or to handle stressful situations like that and realize that maybe it's ok to ask for help I'm not sure! I dont know If he did something like this, but I would really love to see it and sorry for grammar and all that stuff or if he did! I just thought it would be cool!🥰💖💖I really love his videos from what I've seen so far!!!
Beautiful video!
Is it just me or mr. Flores sounds like maaz
I NEED A PART TWOOO
-big inhale~     IS HE GAY, OR EUROPEAN?
Hey Thomas I don’t really know if this is like your way of coming out but I’m kinda still curious about if you are gay or not I can’t blame you for not wanting to answer this question as it might be a little to personal but I just wanted to let you know that we’re all okay with you being gay like I still confused about my own sexuality but I’m so proud of you for not caring at all and making vine and tick toks about your sexuality that’s all I wanted to say have a nice Halloween Thomas and everyone
does anyone else notice that the few moments when Virgil is happy, his eyeshadow is purple and sparkly, and when he's normal it's just black? I think thats sooo cute
xD ngl when I read the title I thought this was going to be a ship of Roman and Virgil-
THIS WAS TO FREAKING CUTE  *starts gibbering in gay*
Someone should ask if he ships Virgil and Roman in the next Q&A
10:45 (the iunno, plant? Scene)
This... this if accurate... so bad I hated the second hand embarrassment in this but its so true!! And my name is Niko and this gave me g a y  p a n i c  like I've never felt jesus-
Soooo..... stalking....  OH YOUR RIGHT
This is my first time watch me so correct me if im wrong, but....if there like your personalities....why do ppl ship them with each other..
This just screamed be more chill and the song left brain right brain
That was adorable! 💜 purple heart for Virgil ❤ red heart for Roman  ♡︎ white heart for every color in the world to Thomas
If someone looked at me during the end they would probably think I was having a stroke-
Let me win your toys for you
OH GOD I AM SEQUELING WHILE I AM WATCHING THIS AHHH
GAH DEMON
Is PRINXIETY real!?!?!?
Best thing I've watched
I- prinxiety is official ❤💜 I know it
ok ship
ok but the fact virgils eye shadow became spakly and lilac when he was ecited is so cute asdafdfs
can i just say that i absolutely loved the format of this episode? i mean the artists did a wonderful job, the amount of work and talent is just off the charts and we should all worship at their feet. but i would really love to see some more episodes in this style - it allowed for the Sides to interact more directly with each other and the enviroment, also he visual jokes were so cute (Princey and Virgil popping out of the clothing rack, the commentators, the perfume sellers etc.). i dunno, i just really loved this style. can't wait where the story goes next!
This gayness is so simp but I love it
When you realize the movie said rated R+
10:08
That's gotta be the best thing I've ever seen!!! I love it so much!!!
This art is so cute, idk if I want more of this or more live action or both
THAT WAS SO CUUUTE! 😭
So are we just going to ignore the fact that the dude is literally just Michael fucking Mell?
Why when I read the title for like a second I was like "flirting with Virgil?
This is so beautiful... I even cried myself vrying at the end
This was amazing!! I squealed out loud when Thomas sat down with the other guy💕
"We don't even know if he's gay" "Ah but your ignoring one key thing thomas;  *We don't know If he's not gay* " "You have used that argument on me far too many times"
*PRINXIETY LEVEL 1000*
I'm surprised I didnt hear a There! Right There! Quote from roman.  If he did and I missed it: type it here V
Wait r u gae?
This was sooo frickin adorable 😍. I need a live action version of this! ❤️
This is so relatable on so many levels.
Tomas,are you REALLY gay?
HOLY SHIZ I JUST HAD HAPPY HANDS-
God I wish this would happen with my crush
(:>)
just commenting my timestamp 11:28
Are we ready for this ....  uhhh definitely!
oh beauteous bard in the court of food thy essence of love I have imbued  (had to finish that couplet)
Virgil is like uhh shoot I'm bye and he push we a him ladys and Getlmen this is what we call a g a gay panic
Smol cringe, large adorbs.
I love this so much it's awesome
I was wondering where you've been.
Is it weird that I see them as different people instead of characters that one person plays. Like I can’t imagine Logan and Roman being played by the same person but it’s somehow true...(Thomas you always do a great job)
When Nico started talking about the song............I- I- I dunno, plant??
this hits way too close to my pride pin covered, anxiety-prone heart.
I THOUGHT VIRGIL AND PRINCEY WERE GONNA KISS AAAAA
I wonder if the theory that Virgil was apart of Patton then wouldn’t that mean that Patton was originally the opposite of Logan and Janus if you think about it the “dark sides” seem to be created by the light sides or just wanting the same as the light sides jus tin a “darker” way
You know why virgil pushed thomas to their crush-  CAUSE he doesn't want to see Roman being a sad prince- :'>
This is pure Roman x Virgil fuel right here
Nico, ey~
that was very gay I liked it a lot
14:32  We not gonna talk about the fact that Thomas HISSING when he said  "Scene..."? JANUS STOP MAKING HIM LIE TO PEOPLE-
Virgil- Eye shadow- Purple?! Aww! Virgil looks so amazing with it, I know it's probably not a permanent thing but I love it! Keep up the good work!💜
That was so wonderful. 😭
I love the lego Disney castle!!!!!!!!
So when Virgil is excited his eyeshadow is purple
No one: No one at all: Not even the dark sides NOT EVEN REMUS: Virgil: *SHOVE*
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Hey Thomas do you think you can make a lore video since some of the fandom has been wanting it
me mentally squealing at the fact that Roman and Virgil both got so excited about the Nightmare Before Christmas sticker.... i adore that-
"shut up emo" omg lol that was hilarious and the entire thing was so adorable!
I got a question. Have you watch the owl house?
Can we make this a movie. Please
AWWWW MY FACEEEEE THIS IS SO ADORABLE!!!!
More!!!!
I don't want to feel the full videos I don't know what's going to happen yet but please no one spoil it cuz I know some adult but this is good I like watches his vines on YouTube like they are so funny so funny that I wish Brian was the real Vine was really good it was a part of our life but now we have Tik Tok
He made Roman depresso
19:40 this is so sweet. im in tears
O l d g u y
That is me
I wish a can join
The tips of reading stickers to figure out if someone was gay made me realise my science teacher is gay. They have pride flag, multiple band stickers and Starbucks lol
The end of this video is amazing because I’m so proud of Virgil making Thomas get a little out of his boundaries and my ship with Roman and Virgil I’m sorry I’m fan girl if
Yessss$
No one is gonna hear Thomas talking to two people only he can see
Virgil and Roman sitting in a tree K.I.S.S.I.N.G First comes love then comes marriage then comes baby in a baby carriage
VIRGIL’S SHY SMILE AT RO? RO’S HEART EMOTES?!! *THE HAND ON THE S H O U L D E R ? ! ! ? ?*
when will next sanders sides video be uploaded out of curiosity
"shut up emo" ha oml
Why do I ship Prinxiety they are technically just other emotions Of Thomas. But they are so cute together (don’t mind me I’m just talking to myself here :’) )
This was so cute! Loved it:)
the entire episode was about LYING and janus wasn’t here onceeee nooooo
Watched this right before going on my first date with a girl. The gay panic is real
I love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYOpRa4OGD4 good old 2016 singing sanders
When is the next one?!?!?
My little queer heart can't take this!!!!!!🏳️‍🌈
That speech almost made me gay XD
That. was. SO. CUTE
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW!!!!EVERYONE STAY CALM!!!!
YEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!AGHHHHHHHH
Omg I love your videos and I have actually sent you some fan art I did on Instagram ❤️ (@BulletProof_ArtOfficial) 🥺
my freinds : what are you doing?!?! me : i dont know plant
This for some reason made me go into panic attack lol  I’m ok now
UGHHH IT WAS SO CUTEEEE OMGGGGGGGGG
Yes
YES, I FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITHOUT LETTING MY ADHD GET IN THE WAY AND DISTRACT ME FROM PAYING ATTENTION!! ... I guess there really is a reason my mom won’t allow me to go to public school anymore😅.
Love the mcr reference
Awesome video
Two things 1) They were literally shaming deceit/Janus the whole time 2) off topic, can Patton adopt me 3 as a bonus) also off topic, Remus would be my best friend if he actually existed :)
The eye shadow change with Virgil... And also is this real or...?
THE EYESHADOW 😱😱😱😱 It's CHANGING 😍
Roman: What are you doing?  Thomas: I dunno.. Plant Me: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺so cute Edit: The expressions Roman and Virgil make as animatics just hits different...
"I dunno, _plant_ "
Are we ready for this?  Virgil doesn't seem to think so.  Why does this worry me.
My broke ass scrolling through the pledges, crying my eyes out cause I can't be a patron to the greatest YouTuber in the world that has ACTUALLY made a long-term impact on my life😭😭😭😭
22:50 HAPPY VIRGIL MAKES ME HAPPY
OMG! I am in love ❤️ it was awesome ❤️
Oh my gosh, I LOVE
Does this mean Thomas is dating someone now?
This.....this was FAR to relatable ;-;
I-  I dont think I've ever been able to relate to anything more in my life XD
Did you ever make the betty the Beatle story line?
Hi. Virgil's my favorite character!  T^T
Hello, hope you are doing well and staying safe. I know this might be strange but I had a question as far as Sander's Sides. Since all of the sides are figments of Thomas's imagination, can Remus or Roman control the other sides reactions or feelings because they are the sides that reign over Creativity and imagination?
This made me so happy😊
🥺😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥰
DID I JUST NOTICE THAT VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PUPEL WHEN HES HAPPY? PLZ TELL        ME THIS IS NEW AND I HAVEN’T JUST MISSED IT!
This reminds me of old DanPlan
Also I’m glad about you coming out
Dude it got so emotional imagine seeing a guy randomly talking to a wall (no offense)
Mack plush
I just realized logic and the others are a split personality but also features if you agree you can like you don’t have to
IS PRINXITY OFFICIAL YET
3:37 Me: **Imagining Virgil sitting on Roman....**
“You’re ignoring one key thing Thomas” *We don’t know that he’s not gay*
so is it sanders sides or  Sanders Asides?
Is anyone else thing to figure out if this is based off a real situation that Thomas went through and that this handsome gay man is real? I hope so. Thomas deserves all the love!
Oh my gawd it's so goooddd
Man I remember you from vine wow
Virgil is me when I'm upset/had a 'nice' talk with my parents or if it's a Monday
wait did this really happen or is it just a story and you talked to yourself the whole time
This man makes me so happy
Me:I'm going to have to unsubscribe to Thomas he hasn't posted in 4 months *sees new video*Never mind I'm going to keep a subscription today
So this just happened, true story btw. So I'm being Remus for Halloween, i was telling my Mom about the characters then i said, "I really like the newest episode, it's called Gay or Nay." And she goes,"Did u say Gay?" And i was like yeah. Then she says,"that worries me." Then i said,"Thomas is gay, so me and my brother are being gay characters." Then she said something homophobic. I was just standing there like y r u homophobic. So yeah my Mom is a homophobe, and don't worry u lovely people i support u and so do others u don't need to prove anything to anyone. Have a nice day!
COME ON THOMAS!!
Bro it is so depressing how much I relate to literally everything in this video ESPECIALLY THE LOOKING FOR 6 SECONDS
ahhhhh this boosted so much ✨serotonin✨ for me, you don’t understand. I was ✨stimming✨ uncontrollably at the end just 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Can you make more vidssss
I think that the “play along” thing scene is so interesting  because I feel like women and other marginalized genders have an unspoken code that they always play along in case a predator is around or someone is being followed so I’m like “of COURSE I would play along you never know when someone is in danger and needs strength in numbers!” But this guy was so RUDE to Thomas  I’m like did he never learn the rules?? That’s so awful Do men not have that?
why... why do i ship two aspects of a fictional personality?????
DOOOO INTRULOGICAL PLEEEEAAAASSSSEEE!!!!! OR ANYTHING, JUST BOTTOM LOGAN PLEASSSE!!!!
This whole thing was just one large gay panic.
We’re going to ignore he was doing rwa- lol
I JUST NOTICED VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW KEEPS CHANGING!!!! ITS TURNING PURPLE!!! WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?! THOMAS I NEED ANSWERS!!!!
I AM CRYING. THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I AM IN LOVE
I can't get over that when Virgil is happy  he has shiny purple eyeshadow!  That's adorable.
Thomas:"Punk little punk"  Me: why does that sound familiar My sister talks smack about my oldest sister infront of her  Oldest sister: little punk Me:* suprised picachu face*
If Nico is real, I want to hear his song.
this gave me so much secondhand embarrassment shehshwhehwhgs
Hey I'm not sure if you take requests but, One of my friends is trying to hurt themselves and won't listen to me when I tell them not to What do I do?  (For the normal sides series)
hey sanders maybe you could do a video on asking for help because i just realized that i am a prideful individual who has trouble asking or even seeing when i need help
My anxiety felt this hard
Ok, Edgy McMy Chemical Romance
Comfort Episode <3
Omgomgomgomgomg does this mean you have a boyfriend now!?
no way am i hearing this correctly, Mr.Flores? Niko Flores? rebgwhsdbgawYICGQWYEGFOQ3YWEGFOQ3WEGBCYQWAEBCGIYLQ23G BROOOOOOOO... isnt that the character for that one musical thingy, the one were they sang Gay or European? cuz if yes then I FINALLY GOT A JOKE KJBVCXZHSTFHGJNHjedeuwevcu .. oh and im also haveing flashbacks to the musical. :-; anyways thank you for coming to my ted talk, or rant.. hehe... :P
I LOVE THAT!!!!
He only put me in one episode I still am wondering why.btw JEFFERY DAHMER
"buuuuuuut...  we still don't know if he's gay.." ah,  the struggle of the gay...  not knowing who is a fellow gay-
God, this is so relatable. In the before times, Gerard Gay sent me.
So, i just noticed that virgils eye shadow changes, when his was hopeful it was purple, but when thomas said "are we ready for this?" His eye shadow turnd black...oh oh.
Thomas can we have more animaticsssss plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I loved it
I'm not crying, you're crying
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 The dog in the backround
Please tell me we can make a new ship out of this-
I FEEL LIKE I WATCHED A WHOLE MOVIE THAT WAS FUCKING GREAT
idk.... *plant*
Wait, for real question if the sides can control Thomas then is that kind of like dissociative identity disorder?    dont mind me, i just wanted to know me and my friends were talking about it and now im curious
I appreciate everyone talking about the interactions between Roman and Virgil but, I barely see comments talking about how this is like everyone who’s experienced anxiety.   I had connected to this video on a emotional level and I had nostalgia from what this had to show.  It was quite a unique video and I love every single interaction with all my heart. It really makes me want to change my view and start making the opportunities I missed out on.  Sadly I can’t do anything right now cause I’m sick.
14:57  Except with my depressionXD
Thomas really teasing us with some prinxiety at the end omg  heart
I LOVE IT TOP MUCH MY NEW FAVORITE VIDEO It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen
Janus reminds me of bill from gravity falls
I LOVED THAT VIDEO WITH ALL OF MY SOUL
THIS IS ADORABLE 😭
You know, I love how Virgil went from being "You're going to fail. There's no pointing in trying, just give up now" to "He has fears too?! Shut up" He did a lot of development, and has really changed a lot, and I like it 😊
YOUR COOL! I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
“ he’s got some stickers on his laptop “ *” pretty gay “*
Did yall notice at 23:18 Virgil’s eyeshadow was black? That’s so cute lol it’s as if his old self returned for a moment
YOU BROUGHT UP THE ANXIETY HAND THING!!! When my anxiety is up, I get so much nervous energy, and for some reason it all goes straight into my hands.
im GONNA cry UGH I missed this DAMN YOU 2020
This is awesome I'm excited for the real episode but I love the animated version too! also I had no idea gay eyes were a thing, is that how I'm supposed to figure that kind of thing out? Lol
Omg this is amazing!
Yay, enjoyed it!
SHIP IT! I so ship it! THOMAS!
*Roman flirting with Virgil * Me:turns into couch
WAIT when virgil got angry at the end his eyeshadow turned back to black- is the eyeshadow like a gaydar but its virgils happy-dar
The prinxiety is strong in this one 🥺😳
i feel like at this point roman and virge could easily be dream daddy characters
Random thing but it would be adorable if patton called logan logie hoagie
Will never forget the time Thomas followed me on Instagram and then immediately unfollowed me, best day of my life ily thomas no hard feelings <3
M e s h i p t h i s c u t e s h i p 🌈✨😌✌️🧃🏳️‍🌈
11:02  Jack?
So basically, no sanders side is bad. Thomas just has to learn and accept each of them
‘top o’ the mornin’ to ya’ :D
Remus: oh shut up emo Roman: shut up emo
Just watching this gave me more anxiety i love it
purple eye-shadow.... PURPLE EYE-SHADOW!!!!
Sorry!! I couldn't help but watch the last scene 5 times and scream each time the fujoshi in me couldn't help it!! But I loved it I really am interested in how nico and Thomas's relationship progresses from now and I'd love to see more I'm sure all of us loved it, have an amazing day!! 🏳️‍🌈😊🏳️‍🌈 (couldn't find asexual flag so I put the homosexuality flag instead!! QwQ)
Me: “Push him Virgil. Push him. PUSH HIM DO IT DO IT!”  Virgil: **pushes Thomas**  Me: _”I KNEW IT! Y E S!!”_
"Yeah, join me! No thinking!"  I'm dead.
I DEAD FROM THIS EPISODE. THIS WAS SO CUTEEEEEEEE. And it slightly feed into Virgil and romans relationship as friends. IT WAS TOO CUTE TO HANDLE.
AWWWWWWW
That was so cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺
That  moment you forget Thomas is both roman and virgil
I love the eyeshadows of Virgil (my English is horrible 😔👌)
So it’s decided prinxiety is real
5:18 its officially time to scream
omg i recently been having bad days, yesterday being r e a l l y bad-- i finally got around to catching up on these videos and they made me laugh so hard!!! this really brightened my mood😺
This becoming a cartoon part 2, after like 3 years
Thomas: *Janus’* corridor of stored rewards! Virgil:I don’t think I like this very much.
Everything could be more gay                                            EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I LOOOOOOVE IT
Virgil isn’t even my anxiety and he makes me nervous
This has nothing to do with the actual point of the video, but I appreciate that you are so honest with how much work goes into these and how FUCKING HARD it is to make a production like this, how much time and money it takes. I see too many artists getting discouraged at the beginning when their final product looks lackluster to them, but you cant just start out with hd cameras and a crew unless you have rich parents. You just *cant*
Is no one going to talk about when Virgil said "You're making a mistake!" Roman's response was  "If I am... I'll add it to the list!" That line alone makes me sad. I might be looking too hard into it, but it gives me the impression that Roman knows he makes mistakes but focuses too hard on them, because he thinks he needs to be perfect for Thomas. I dunno, I'm probably wrong about this sorta assumption.
Absolutely love the purple eye shadow! <3 <3
i like how virgils eyeshadow changes from purple to black to purple to black to purple to black, lol
19:35 I fully expected him to say gay panic
Please make more vines😭🥺☹️
I love this.
Make it fully animated
Oh my god, Thomas I'm swelling up tears!!!  My heart when you let your heart out, I cried. Oh my god I feel so bad for Virgil and Roman.  They really want to be with that dude....it hurt.
Logan and Paton are missing out on some drama! ;)
I'M SCREAMNGNDJDKFN OGMGMDJDJDJSHJ YES THE " Gerard Gay " AND " Shut up emo. " HIT HOME OMH
I was just spealing at the end, this is so adorable!!
10:05 THE MCR REFERENCE KILLED ME
Me sat there: I ship it-  I SHIP IT ALLLLLLLLLLLL-
Seeing Virgil ACTUALLY EXCITED in the eplilouge was just....incredible?!?!?!? He's NEVER been so selflessly excited before!!!! But it's kinda the opposite of anxiety since his eyeshadow changes with his mood now?! He was acting and feeling confident and certain--the opposite of scared and anxious!!! My heart POSITIVELY MELTED seeing him like that!!
*laughs manically in being aromantic* but I am a good wingdeer tho :3 oh dear now im thinking of a liL FAWN WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS AAAWW
THIS IS SO GOOD AND VIRGIL'S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AHHHHHH😍😍😍😍😍😍 MY HEART HURTS 😭😭😭
So cute
Yo he should make this a virtual novel
Me and my sister is dressing up as 2 of the sides ( Virgil and Patton) I love Virgil's confidence in this episode and wish we could see more of it and love how Virgil is changing his appearance slowly and not so fast as the others did.
no one: nico: *exists* virgil: *gay panic*
"sorry to rain on your black parade gerard gay" I CAN'T
The other sides need to see Virgil's new eyeshadow as fast as possible like soon!
THIS WAS SO DAMN AND CUTE AND ALSO WAY TO RELATABLE HOW DARE YOU
So did you know that Animacs had a reboot on Hulu! 👁👄👁✨👌
I'm going to literally cry
AWWWWWW MY HEARRRTTTT
wait is this real
yo Tomas I'm a massive fan I've watched nearly every one of ur vines and I've just found out hav a YouTube channel and I'm so annoyed I've missed out on soo much soo ye now I'm subbed notified and ye hi
bruh this was hilarious XD yet so relatable >~<`
HELP I LOVE THIS SM IM SHHHHSHSHDJDHDJDH
Oh my God! That was so beautiful!!!! I love it! You guys did so well!!!! I’m so shook! (I think that’s the right context) can we please have more of this ❤️ Btw, I love your channel and I hope your life goes well!!!
Thats adorable
That's where sander sides come from I was soooo confused when I was watching gatcha
Thomas I LOVE your videos!!!!! 💜💙💚💜💙💚💜💙💚
I loved every part of this, My two favorite parts were where virgil went into a gay panic, and the second one being when thomas said "...You saw me knock over that trash can, didn't you?" and then Nico/Niko (Im sorry if I spelled that wrong) said "THAT WAS YOU!?!?" And they both started laughing because it was hilarious.
This was so cute, omg...
this is just 24 minutes of me fangirling/boying by how cute this is AHH this is the first time I watched Thomas Sides and I will glady watch more
...my laptop is secondhand and have stickers. Guess I should remove them (and replace them with stuff I like).
i kinda ship virgil x roman now
You can't tell me virgil doesn't go down stairs and start watching haikyuu on Netflix whilst eating chicken nuggets
This was so cool and adorable! I loved the scenario, and the art was lovely! 🥰🥴🙂
this is adorable
please please please do more episodes like this they're so amazing!
That was soooooo cute😍😍😍😍😍
Why is Virgil just the cutest little thing when he's happy😍
Now me: *.... sooo is prinxeity canon?....*
I'm crying, smiling  and screaming right now! I don't know why I just feel so related to the story but the difference is that instead of approaching the fear at the end... I just watch my fillings go bye like a sad ending on a movie... I know that I'm not supposed to expose my self like that but... I just want to put at least some weight out of my bag ... </3
Me: *how many times did roman say he was gay in this?..*
.....is it bad that THAT just made me ship Roman and Virgil a bit more than I used to?
omg- i love how Roman and Virgil worked together #prinxiety
IM LETRALY DEAD I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!
Its to beautiful I love the story
I didn’t get a notification
Virgil saying Blink 182 lines got me!
Anyone else start stimming along with virgil and thomas-
did anyone notice virg has new eyeshadow       tomas pleasepin this comment so people will go back and look tank you!
MURDER ME THAT WAS SO CUTE I CAN'T
I see that 96 on the table 😏 Also, my anxiety levels rose so much just watching this😂 Also, this is hella adorable
Me 2 weeks ago: Virgil: **squishes Roman’s face** Roman: **happy boi** Me: Roman is such a happy bean  Me now: Me right now: Roman is still a happy bean  Me 5 minutes later: Me: wait roman was sad in the last video wait did he pretend to be happy?
This is very cheery, and very true, I have trouble with flirting and I have social anxiety, this actually kinda helped me tbh :D
999,000 views huh.
*dies cuz too cute* ADORABLE BEANS
Lmao i came up with a ship name Nicomas
VIRGIL BEING AWKWARDLY CUTE AND MORE OUTGOING IS SO AMAZING!!!!! AND THE MAKEUP!
This was so funny and so wholesome at the end
I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!IF IT DID I AM SO HAPPY!!!!!!!! I WAS LEGIT ABOUT TO CRY WHEN HE STARTED WALKING AWAY!!!!! I AM LEGIT FREAKING OUT XDDD
Gay-treon anyone?
Do vines and only vines
OH MY GOD THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I'VE SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE
I also have sosile agziaty tho so
Thomas used flirt Thomas is confused Virgil used push Thomas used flirt crit success
*”AHH DEMON!”*
oof this was kind of relatable... no wonder why my friend told me to watch these
Huh he is still here
I would like to make a formal request for Thomas to sing 'toss a coin to your witcher'
This is officially my faviorite sander Sides thing
this really helps me so much for me to cope about me being gay :)  <3
When he said top of the morning I immediately thought of jack and I was like 😲 is that a jacksepticeye reference then I realized that I'm just dumb and it's probably not
I c a l l  k l a n c e
People say if you say the creators name they will pin your comment and reply  THOMAS SANDERS  THOMAS SANDERS  THOMAS SANDERS  More...
This was SO well drawn and acted and such a beautiful message and everything about it was amazing and wonderful <3
YESSSSSSS
gei
Crying
'
This video gave me so much second hand anxitey im fuckin sweating
HA GAAAaaaaaayyyyyyyuuuuvv,,,
This whole video was me screaming at my phone.
This is so amazing oml- As a fellow Lgbtq+ I LOVED THIS, Me and my friends would always watch your vines and we would jokingly say "He is def Gay",  BUT I showed them this and they all cheered saying "WE KNEW IT!" I have never been so happier to figure something out online than this, but like T h i s  w a s  a m a z i n g.
I hope this gets re created in real life
Hey Thomas, have you heard about this how called Escape The Night? I think you should check it out, maybe even be on it in one of the seasons. I think you will like it.
Gay Or European this answer could take weeks.
Omg I have felt this before
Yaaaaaaaaaaassss i loveeeeee ittt its so cuteeeeeeeeeeee(つ✧ω✧)つ I love gay stufffff┻━┻ミ＼(≧ﾛ≦＼)
6:27  Me: I'M DYING. THIS WHOLE SCENE IS SO PERFECT  Also, anyone else picking up some prinxiety in here? Like, specifically near the end, but also how they're like GETTING ALONG the whole time? But seriously, there ARE HEARTS next to Roman after he says "Shut up, Emo". TELL ME I'm not the only one who noticed them!   bc I'm literally dying for this ship to be canon T^T  XD
I’m am begging the gods that none misinterpreted that last part with Virgil and Roman
Wait thomas is gay
16:22 "you mind kinda telling me about that?" Oooooh he was smooth with it
“That’s like cyber stalking but real life” “So stalking?” “Oh right!” Ugh that’s just too cute
I’M NOT CRYING U ARE CJFNDN
"Huh. Delete it." -Virgil
"Ugh pintrverts" --Roman 2020--
Dude just go up to him and say u like his style😌😂🏳️‍🌈  Edit:Oh dear god how I cringed at the baby pan I was just a year ago😭 I rly thought I unlocked the secrets of the universe learning what that meant🫠
Wait wait wait hold up. Since when is trying to come up with something to say lying or am I misreading something here
Omfg!! I relate to this so much! I felt like the video was about me 😅  I feel so happy (and kind of proud) that Thomas was able to talk to that guy! (I haven't made that step yet... I mean, more than 'taking a step' for me is more like jumping out of the window 😅) I'm so happy and motivated rn!!
You can just hear all the prinxiety shippers are rejoicing XD
Prinxiety is REAL!
What the frick that was SO CUTE
I had a mini heart attack ahhhhhh it's so cute!!!
I loved thisss!!! Especially the end card
OH MY GOD A NEW EPISODE!!!   Also, did Virgil's make up change at 23:17???
I started my YouTube channel recently and I would really love some feedback.
Oh my favorite! Sanders Asides!!
Thomas I freaking loved this, I love you artists that helped and virgil just- AcK- My heart ;w;
This is just a sanders version of gay or European lol
Chemical ROMANCE  BLACK PARADE .
Is it just me or does Janus's theme sound like the Stranger Things sequence song?
This is very gay       I love it
OMG in the end i touth Virgil and Roman where About to kiss❤️
i been watching the fandom can someone tell me one is romen and virgile officaly canon and who is paranoiya. sorry bad spelling
I typed up Thomas's bathroom confession scene dialogue for anyone who wants it:   "Look, I know this is awkward, and maybe not the best place to strike up a conversation. I don't really know what to say to you, I honestly don't know what I'm doing at the mall today. I don't know what I was looking for. Hah, I guess that answers my question. The mall is where you go if you want something, but you don't know what it is, because the mall has everything, right? I don't know... Ugh, I don't know a lot about anything. Least of all myself. And I feel that the hardest when it comes to... knowing what I want.  But I know that... I want to take a chance, and talk to you. I have to, because... I don't know when I'm going to know what I want again... and I know... that if I don't act on these feelings right now, I'm going to regret it. I saw you, across the food court and... you were so... radiant. I saw you... and I just knew."
O-M-G I loved this, i coudn't stop looking what was happening.  I felt the same sometimes, i hope all of you keep with this.
What everybody else sees: A cool animated video What I see:            *4 guys being gay. 4 gays being guys.*
I remember when I first tried to watch this I almost couldn’t get through it because of the second hand embarrassment.
dog: **barks** Virgil: GAH, DEMON
Whenever thomas makes a video I feel at home I feel like anxiety is me please thomas if you see this make more sanders sides vids with everything I feel goid when I watch your video thanks 😊
I LOST IT WHEN THOMAS SAID TOP O THE MORNIN TO YA *DECEASED*
Guys, I haven't said it yet, but this is really cute and my gay heart is screaming, i love you all
"You see some buttons, you BUTTON IT."
WHY IS THIS SADDER AS AN ANIMATION?!!?!?!
The second-hand embarassment I just felt had me sobbing, I've never related to something so much.   It also might be because I'm stressed about school, i'm sleep deprived and it's 4 in the morning, so this might've been just the thing to push me over the edge.
Ah I got hit by airplane
I’ve never felt being called out so much in one setting. This is hurting me, why must you make me more self-aware than I already am.  Also that ending: MY HEART’S MELTING I’M CRYIMG OH MY SWEET SEA FAE MY BI HEART IS FRYING SLOWLY
I showed my cousin this, and now every time I say something that annoys her she says, “shut up Emo”  And now I keep telling her to, “shut the FU-“
“Gerard Gay” That was perfection-
Thomas has a date Thomas has a date Thomas has a date
This was so friggen cute ugh!!
Did anyone from the owl house fandom think otter with a dark side during the “gay eyes” by Roman?
the amount of secondary embarrassment this gave me ahHHHH
I am crying
PRINXIETY WAR SCREECHHHH
OMG THE CHARACTERS ARE ADORABLE LIKE THIS. Please do more animatics. I NEEEEED more chibi Roman face
Ello i am just sone gurl on the Internet who doesn’t know if she’s bi XDDD
We love a good prinxiety moment at the end
Week later, and I'm wondering if Thomas can ask Patton to uh... Make a video where he's singing a lullaby... asking for a friend, haha!
My heart-
I dunno...plant?
Hey it’s mr. vine man
Try to tell me that Roman font got a crush in Virgil.
"Its like cyber stalking but in real life" "So stalking?"  "...OH MY GOD YOURE RIGHT"
My heart!!!!!!
I- .... I'm crying... I'm actually crying... 🤧🤧🤧 *insert crying immensely*
So proud of you, Thomas. And everyone who helped make this video. Don’t know you personally, but you are a good soul and a good influencer amidst a sea of negative ones. So thank you so much for being a light amongst the darkness! 😊
My opinion on what all there sexuality's are  Virgil- Goth Bi Roman- Fashionista gay Patton- cute/adorable/adorkable gay Logan- Nerdy Pan Remus- Ace Decite- Demisexual Thomas- Obviously Gay
the ENDDDD HAPPYVIRGILHAPPYVIRGILHAPPYVIRGIL
I'm crying T^T
I mean The Last Airbender
You know my friend Gavin Young you've done tiktoks with him you guys were doing a tick tock about Aang the first Airbender
MY HEART
Great use of the eye shadow.
Can ya’ll do this again?  :3
I'm embarrassed for hi.
24:01 Virgil...... why did you look at Roman with that "I wanna tell you I love you" look?         OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
a d o r a b l e
Was Thomas alternating Virgil's eye shadow at the end to try out a different color? If so, I'm a fan of the purple!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH GAAAAAAYYYYYYYY
This video is so cute!!!!!!!!!! <3 ^_^ I also have social anxiety and I always freak out over every little decision I make. Its annoying = (
Legit "nico" made me think of nico di angelo
I sense princiety in the last scene
I kinda have a crush on Janus...
Not even lying this is the first Thomas Sanders vid I have watched and I love it
Oh pins and buttons yes that's me
I just had a big smile on my face at the end when they were sitting together.
this entire thing is just *gay panic*
Vine is coming back!!!!!! But in the form of an app called Byte it will have the same six second video format, but it will also have...an infinite scroll feed! And it has been worked on over the weekend. So pretty much what I’m saying is F*ck TikTok!!! Also Byte was created by by a Vine-co employee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was beyond ADORABLE!!!😊😊😊😊
Flirting with social anxiety  I THOUGHT IT WAS A VIDEO ABOUT ROMAN FLIRTING WITH VIRGIL BUT MY BRAIN TOOK A U TURN AND SAID NO THATS NOT IT. IT WAS LIKE REMUS AND LOGAN, REMUS WANTS CHAOS WHILE LOGAN WANTS ORDER AND I AM JUST SITTING HERE DIEING BECAUSE I THOUGHT ROMAN WAS GOING TO FLIRT WITH VIRGIL. M DED
Im loving the animatic formaaaat

This whole video was literally a Virgil x Roman video and I love it
“You don’t know if he’s *not* gayyyyy??” As a lesbian, I’m going to use that on myself for the rest of my life. Thank you Roman Edit: I said Patton instead of Roman at first...lmao it’s stupid but I’m hella embarrassed
This is giving me serious left brain right brain vibes and I absolutely love it lmao.
Omgod I loved this
" shut up emo" ;)    omg that was on purpose 110%
That was the best love story ever
Okay is no one gonna mention that Virgils eye makeup changed?
Oh ny god this was amazing. like tears literal tears
Not even a week ago I told one of my friends to ask a girl for her snapchat for me. I got it but now I dont know what to do
I just came out to my sister 2 weeks ago yay, I am finally able to, say I am gay
Roman x Virgil
Patton:that so cute  Logan:wow i didn't expect that from virgil  Janus:are we not gonna talk about virgils eyeshadow  Remus:SHIP
wAIT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE'S EXCITED OH MY GOD
Virgil is amazing "no I wasn't testing you I was just panicking"
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING COLOR OR?!?!  :>
Thomas was demonotized?
“Liar” Janus just appearing in the back just like heyyyyy
oh how I relate to this....
*GASP* DISASTER
Wait a minute.  I just realized that in the intro the aspects of the sides are in quations marks. (Patton "Morality", Virgil "Anxiety", Logan "Logic", Roman "Creativity")  Fanders, you know what that may mean....
Did this happen IRL
The ananation looks like My hero academia
I love the way Virgil's eyeshadow changes color, in the end, from purple to black, based on his feelings.
thomas you really be out here makin me ship your emotions a
I AGGRESSIVELY LIKE THAT VERY MUCH (Also ABDIllustration 🙌🏻) 🌈
It's the "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH" for me🤣😍
Bring back the funny vines and stry time videos
Who else has known Thomas since 2016
So i think when Virgil gets excited his eye shadow is purple! Its so cute!
This part made me want to scream and yell SHIP 19:38 (*ﾉωﾉ)
I like this as is. I’m an animation nut
Hey, you excited-scream just like me, cool ^^ also, YAY!!! Janus is being recognised or whatever the words are!! Yay! He's my favourite ^^ And virgil, I love the glittery purple eyeshadow ^^ it really brings out your eyes.
11:02, Love the JackSepticEye reference lad! The story is great too
Wait....are you gay or bi like......ndndkdndnsjs what. I haven't seen anything of your posts since middle school haha
I'm crying😭😍❤️❤️
NO YOU NO🤣  All jokes aside, I've been laughing and crying through this amazing, awesome video
I could not stop smiling. This entire video.
This was more relatable then I thought it would be
I started re watching old sander sides videos with CC on and when logan called patton *daddy* by accident it said in ( ) ship
VIRGIL TELLING THOMAS TO STIM!! Virgil BLUSHING
Imma CRY. Virgil..did that for ROMAN. I. Am having. A heart attack.
THE JANUS STUFF ALDJALDJSLJD
There were two couples in this video.
man dat made my heart sing
THE JOHN MULANEY REF
I HAVE AN IDEA THOMAS!!! YOU SHOULD MAKE SANDER SIDES ONESIES!!! That would be awesome!! Just an idea would be cooolllll just want to spread it
Who else couldn't help but wonder why the title is still spelled wrong?
Is this based on a true story?.. because this is *BEAUTIFUL* 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖
Hahaha thatk you
THE SHUT UP EMO AT THE END KAKSKDKKFJFJFKKSKS
See, this is why Thomas is my favorite YouTuber He Is Too Funny And I love it I wanna sub but YouTube wont let me ;w; I have subbed to you in my other account tho I love how Thomas is really realtble with this tho
That was so good
So... this was absolutely amazing.   I can't even...  BRAVO, DUDE!!!
i missed sander sides
I smell a double ship! 😏
I wonder what the people’s Perspectives in these...Considering they can’t see the other sides.
Im an EX EX EX EXPERT
am I just dumb or did I just notice Virgil's eye makeup is now a glittery purple?! Like I thought It was black!!!
The other guy looks like the mazzing
Virgil going "that's like cyber stalking...but in real life" And roman responding "so...staling" Has the same energy as me going "is there such thing as hypnogogic hallucinations but while you're awake" And my friend responding "yes....? They're called hallucinations?" XD oof
Yes- just- Y-E-s
I loved this s o much, I was so cute!
IM DYING OF HAPPINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍
Why is no one talking about that moment at 10:35?? Virgil: Roman, you're making a mistake! Roman: If I am, I'll just add it to the list!  !!! like omg more evidence that Roman is stewing on the past and will eventually hit a breaking point of regret/self-anger, I mean we already saw his hesitance to trust himself in this episode and the last few but I'm so scared/excited to see his arc continue in the same way Patton's did ahhhh
This made me literally so happy to see. Thomas is someone I guess I kinda put on a pedestal so seeing that he also has the gay struggle is just so relatable and really nice to see. One of my favorite creators, awesome person. Thank you so much for being someone people can look up to!!
I loved the video, it is very relate able to me and I love your channel, also and you other channel "Thomas Sanders & Friends."
Ok I used to wonder why people shipped Prinxiety, but after seeing this, it makes a little more sense, haha.
Gerald gay I’m-
I MISSED THE REVEAL OF DECIETS NAME!?!?
His eye makeup switching back and forth and the end there? Roman saying that he just showed bravery? Omg what if he becomes the side for both anxiety and bravery?
AHHHH- At the end when they all come home, Virgil's little scream is ADORABLE!!!!! And his eyeshadow is purple when he's not super anxious!! It's just- AHHHHHHH X)
I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay 😭 the amount of theatre and music references I keep spotting make me so happy
When are you going to post another video
me: *tries to talk to my crush* thomas: alright off to a bad start. completely wrong direction. also thomas: you're a creep, you're a weirdo what are we doing here??
That was great!!
Oh my gosh 😂 Was this a real encounter?
Omg soo cute
Please tell me I wasn’t the only one who was waiting for Remus to come out of no where
I love how this episode shows that Virgil also represents Thomas's excitement, cause being anxious and being excited can give you similar feelings. Like getting butterflies in your stomach.
Prinxitey moments are real
Bro why did this hit so close to home that it is home I feel I can relate to Thomas on behalf of social anziaty and what the guy said about the song he wanted to write someone's life piling up there emotions being trapped and piled up until they spill out that's what caused V to do that that was all those emotions turning into bravery I can relate to him of behalf of that and I respect Thomas deeply I feel he is that little light everyone needs..if you see this Thomas which you probably won't thank you for brightening everyone's world 🖤  (Sorry I can't spell qwq)
I loved the video good work to you and every one else
The first one really called me out tho
19:37 Sooo,, are we not gonna talk about how Roman is canonically taller than Virgil 𝙖𝙩 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙩 𝙗𝙮 𝙖 𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙗𝙞𝙩?
Can you do vins again
Hey Thomas! Another great video. Keep up the great content
Will the Janice tee be released later but patreon supporters get it first?
14:21 ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Can you do more of these?
im just gonna say i love virgils makeup
“You’re a creep, you’re a weirdo... what the hell are we doin here?” Creep Radiohead reference.
"What are you doing?!" "Idk, plant?"  "My name isn't max, it's Prince Roman!"  "He fears to?!"  And when Virgil pushed Thomas because roman was sad... my heart  And Virgil's sparkly eyeshadow
20:16 lil punk. lil lil punk. also i love the bit about Janus running the patreon lol ive seen it a million times
Thomas, I just watched your "Just keep breathing" cover and I think you should go on masked singer!
Do you hear that? It’s the prinxiety fans screaming
i dont know about the ship of virgil and roman but they can do what they want ( OK THATS A LIE. IM SHIPPIN THEM
This is my life in a nutshell when I see someone I like-
I've entered this fandom at the worst time with all these CLIFFHANGERS - Roman not "being the hero" - Janus coming over to the "light" - Virgil going purple eyeshadow and saying he used to be one of the others I NEED THESE THREADS TO CONTINUE! Also I would die for Virgil after watching two videos (watched them all now)
Gay eyes? ❤️G🧡A💛Y💚   💙E💜Y❤️E🧡S💛!💚  Me the whole time: just get Logan oh my god! *Just* *get* *LOGAN* !!
So this is why you neglected the Funny Shorts  So witch of the personalities is straight?  The pretentious prince and Anxiety sure love working together to mess with you   Wait Princy is part of you so how do you not know what he said about seeing an attractive guy, do you have split personality?
That bathroom hit different....
I've watched this animation so many timesssssss. It's so friggin cuteeeeeeeeeee. Virgil is literally me at this point XD
Join me, NO THINKING!
Janus is getting replaced by Logan he is a liar!
Me and the other shippers at the thumbnail: G A Y
19:30 leaving a timestamp for my serotonin
The art is AMAZING! Kudos to your artist friends, this is awesome! I think it fits the story really well!
It been so long I am so happy
Thomas are you gay? PLEASE ANWSER ME I KNOW YOUR ADRESS     The last part was fake BUT ANWER ME ME
did this actually happen though
Me: looks at release date: 1 week ago? Its been 5 years-
Was Patton pretending to be Roman at the begining?
Thomas is gay!? Then that means...YESSSSS!!!!! VIRGIL A GAY!!!!
These comments in a nutshell  10%: quotes and laughing 90%: pin👏trix👏y.👏 we👏 want👏 it👏
This was so cute and so adorable at the same time and when Virgil even though he was scared he pushed Tomas to talk to him so Roman and Tomas could be happy that was amazing I loved this probably my favorite sanders side episode that’s been made good job Tomas
I don't know why...but-   I think this animation made me realize my sexuality. Because knowing how I get attracted to my opposite gender or my similar gender well...its obviously bisexual of me- and I get scared thinking about it. I get scared that I wouldn't fit in anymore...that people would judge me for who I am, and I just get very insecure about it. But now...I wanna accept who I am, and I won't let others make me get away of being myself. *Sooo uh...thankyou?* ^^"
Why is this me 24/7
AwwwWww
its adorable watching Thomas be gay .  and they animated a look of admiration when Roman looked back at Thomas Virgil was looking at him with admiration/ love  # my ship
Asocial not anti-social.
the shippers are going insane
My cold gay heart❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈
The animation is SO nice and smooth WOW good job every vid should be like this also have a nice day
“Our final form” that was really funny
I like how as Virgil eyeshadow became more brighter as he smiles, the space he is in also brightens up. Vice versa when he goes back to black eyeshadow, the room darkens
I cant join 😓😓😓😓😥😥😥😥
EEEEEEKKKKKKKKK 😍😍💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️
so kawaiii-
Might be a bit too late to ask but, is there gonna be another QnA with the Sides? If there is i wish that Janus and Remus was in it. That would look chaotic :>
not me yearning and crying in gay single at 4am over this
is it just me or is the art style similar to the drawings in the story dork diaries?
I have never been so happy for someone when they met a cute boy. ALSO Virgil with purple eyeshadow aaaaaaaaaaaajnnjidnsfjnajnhiufhjA
Weird question: Sanders Sides character Thomas is still a Youtuber right? What videos does he make? The same ones we see? Or different ones?
I’m being honest. I still don’t believe Deceit’s name is Janus
THOMAS I LOVE YOUR VIDS
YOU HAVE OUTDONE YOURSELVES!!! The voice acting and the art and just EVERYTHING is so BEAUTIFUL!! And to top it off..   𝗚𝗔𝗬.
pls do this in real life
THAT LAST MOMENT, THAT MOMENT, THE “Shut up emo.” HFNSKDJSIDJEJC THAT WAS THEIR ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP PACKED INTO ONE SENTENCE
Am I proud that everyone is special to be who they are
That’s was super cute.....I related a lot only that I...that I then go home and cry  :)
yes plz do a live action one plz plz ??
i can relate to this on so many levels-
Every single time  something exciting happened I started screaming into my pillow. Any one else?
VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN HES HAPPY/FLUSTERED 💜
Why am I getting Inside Out feelings about this...
Our boys are back
As a Demisexual girl with social anxiety yet creative personality~ I can SORTA relate :3 ...And more importantly this is a PRINXIETY EPISODE!~
Thomas can you please reply and like this if you see it your amazing
1. I cannot believe this is free and I am amazed at how much dedication went into making this wonderful creation 2. I am so grateful that I stumbled upon this thoughtful, charismatic, every-positive-adjective-ever, complete masterpiece 3. Thank you to your amazing self and the amazing individuals you collabed with for sharing your gifts and hard work and putting all of this together, it is the most inspiring thing and it made my year  (My throat is sore from breaking my walls with laughter throughout and subduing sobs while he was speaking in the mirror but it was 110% worth it)
"You should've just said hi" why is that always the response lmao. I'm to anxious to walk up to someone and say hi
Me: **Sees le title** Me: “imagine being able to even  get close and walk near or even exist near my anxiety, sounds fake” Half of the human population: “Same”                        Also this is great I could never do this-
This put me on a full emotional roller coaster
I was not expecting an MCR reference, I was not prepared
I SHIP NICO FLORES WITH THOMAS SANDERS SAIL OTP SAIL
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA This was so cute!!! Omggggg its so wholesome! And that ending was so sweet.... Like AAAAAAA
Dude, I love your work, but I have to watch in, like, 30 second increments before the empathy gets too much and I gotta take a break.
We really get to see the princxiety here
I WAS SQUEALING WHEN ANXIETY PUSHED THOMAS TO NICO!!! AND WHEN THEY STARTED TALKING I STARTED FANGIRLING EVERYWHERE AND WHEN NICO SAID “let’s not waste this one” I JUMPED ON MY BED! OH THE SUSPENSE GETS TO MEeE!! THIS WAS GREAT!
I didnt know you had a channle
gay Prinexty my moments
Loved the John Mulaney reference. And "I hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay" killed me.
I have gay pins..... maybe one day...... IS THIS A SIGN?!?!?!?
This is why people ship Roman and Virgil😂
The sandersides are back!!! GOD IVE MISSED THEM ALL!!!!! ❤
Me quietly scweeling of the screen yelling at Roman and Virgil to kiss
Prinxiety forever.... I ship it
Never clicked on a video so fast
Thomas said, "So enjoy!" and I immediately got an ad for baking cookies. The first line of said ad was "Wanna learn how to share the love?"
Virgil making a blink-182 reference and Roman making an MCR reference in the same episode made my emo heart cry out with joy. Well, more like... made my emo lips smile slightly... but you get what I mean.
I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay  Me: *dies*
[this is so cute!]
When 2 of your personality aspects fall in love...
This made me so happy
4:44 5:28 introvert facts
wow love this video
Lol this situation is so farmiliar. I use the pins on my jacket and two of them have rainbows. I went into Subway, and there was a reeeeeaaaaaaaally cute girl. And she commented about them, asking what is said. I told her, and she was so cool. "oh, thought it was gay" and she smirked... 0\\\w\\\0. And I just blurted out "No! It is gay! Very gay! I'm gay! Very very very gay!"
the fact that literally everyone on Pinterest now has the profile picture of Virgil with purple eyeshadow and I love that. Virgil is literally amazing and he deserves love 💜
Virgil is a mood, I need a Roman in my life
THIS IS SO CUTE PLZ TELL ME THIS IS REAL PLZZ 🥺🥺
Wow that's so deep
Me inside: *GAY SCREAMING*
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW WAS PURPLE AND GLOWING SO PRETTY-
Virgils eyeshadow keeps turning black to purple and it's amazing cuz he's happy 🤗😊
Dog: * starts barking * Virgil: AHH, DEMON
Did you change Virgil's eyeshadows on purpose ???
I THOUGHT VIRGIL WAS BARKING AT THE END I-
“Join me, no thinking!” - Roman 2020
That was amazing and!!  I was wondering if you could react to the animatic Don’t Threaten Me With a Good Time made by  Leeningtowerofpizza?
15:40 holy crap man...
MY PRINXIETY HEART
DID ANYONE CATCH THE BLINK-182 REFERENCE AT 5:18 "We can live like Jack and Sally, if you want"
I WAS CRYING HOLY
Them screaming at the end 🥰
It's so cute and I'm so late 😭💜
EEEEE!!

I literally started crying 😭
Me exploding: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

This is so prinxiety to be honest
Hey, Tell me, do you have DID? Just asking because I have and it feels so accurate... All of it... Anyway!  Nice concept of this animatic video! Great work to all of you!
I love how V's eyeshadow turns purple and sparkly when hes exited :0
Gosh darn! I really cheered for them!! This is my weirdest ship ever
The last part was so adorable I was giggling the whole time🥺
Me fucking fangirling when Roman and Virgil were saying *SHUT UP!*
HE'S BACKK
‘5’ ‘no ‘4’ ‘no’ 3’ ‘gay’ 2 ‘no’ ’ ‘1’ ‘gay? *HES GAY*

AHHH I LOVE THISSSS!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH VIRGIL GIT NERVOUS BECAUSE HE MADE ROMAN SADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD (im sorry, im just a really really overly dramatic prinxiety fan ;w;)
Aaaah this hits me so hard! XD
This makes me have anxiety because this happens to me-
I love this so much, this has changed me
Nico/Thomas Love interest in this is 100% Michael Mell from BMC and shall be played by George Salazar when there’s a live action !!!
Oh no its too relatable. Never thought I had social anxiety, huh. Makes sense...
Dose this mean ugot a boyfriend
Getting back on the train of Sanders sides and i am so happy i did
THE WAY I SQUEALED AT 19:31 OH MY GOOOOOD!
This.... MADE ME SO HAPPY UGGHHH
I really want to talk to a cute guy in one of my classes but my anxiety says it’s a bad idea :(
Wow. Just wow
Have you guys seen Roman???? Have you seen him????? Roman????? LOOK AT HIM????? LOOK AT HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
The Prinxiety dynamic is so much more than any of us ever dreamed it would be and it’s SO BEAUTIFUL and I’m SO F-KING GAY
OMGGGGG this is soooooo epic/awesome
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Roman is so wonderful and positive and I’m just so happy he’s happy or at least in good spirits for this video and him and Virgil getting along is so fucking precious I love them so much how do I process this
Roman is so cute oH MY GOD
Prince X  anxiety yay. Also Tomas such a good person I love you (friendwise)
remember when he was making vines that was sad
I’m sorry but GERARD GAY!!
I wish anxiety would be nice in real life. Unfortunately my anxiety is just a straight up banana peel. It makes me slip/miss over good opportunities. This was too relatable :((( But that aside i did like this video very much and I thought it was really funny in a way.
I loved this!!!! The funniest part is that I would also run into a garbage can.
THIS WAS SO CUTE!! T^T
19:58 DID ANYONE SEE THE HEARTS AT ROMANS FACE???!!!!!  DOES THAT MEAN VIRGIL HAS A CRUSH ON ROMAN OMGGGGGG IM TOO GAY FOR THIS  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH MY HEARTTTTT❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯
Hmmmm, for a second virgil’s eyeshadow turned back to normal.... Could it be that his eyeshadow only turns purple when he’s excited?  I don’t know if I’m the last one to notice or what XD
9:08 me in a nutshell
Lying wouldn't make the relationship even better ,but telling the truth would. 😭😭Man this made me cried a little. I shall gig it a like and Subscribe!
Am I the only one who saw.......PRINXIETY AT 19:38?!  (Btw it’s the ship name for Roman x Virgil)
Sooo....no ones gonna talk about Virge and roman roman-ce?
Awwwwwwwwwww this so cute
I had this problem today I think a girl in my class is bi or gay and I can't ask her so I have no friken idea what to do help !!!!
Ah the joy of Sanders sides <3
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH IM SCREAMING now all I need is Virgil and Roman kiss
This is gay panic in a nutshell
NOTHING MAKES ME SMILE UNCONTROLLABLY but *THIS*
So cute <3 explains my life perfectly XD
I love it too much!!! I love it!!!!
This is so adorable and I relate a little too much to the being super awkward when being interested in someone
bruh that went from 'slice of life rom-com drama where no one knows hes gay' to 'sad but wholesome and heartwarming romantic themed anime' to 'romantic slice of life BL'   I love it here
WBFISJDIFB SHUT UP BRO THIS IS SO CUTE 💖💖
I love the purple virge, you are more like the purple guy everyday 😌
I’m smiling so hard right now
Did this episode make me start shipping Roman and Virgil???? Maybe it has👀
IM LOVING THIS
THIS IS SO CUTE
Loving the animation!
I love the video- iT wAs sO cUtE- I was paying half of my attention to Thomas- aNd tHe oThEr hALf iS dEdiCAtEd tO pRiNxIeTy- tHeY aRe sO cUtE tOgEtHeR!! ( My opinion. DO NOT HATE!! Please!  O w O )
" idk- plant. . " 👉👈💦
G A Y.   E Y E S
Virgil’s eye shadow changes! Oh my god, we’re seeing another side of him and his eye shadow is changing and just- Ohhh my god, what if we start seeing different colors with the other sides too? Black is a big theme around the more neutral/bad sides, what if we start seeing more color? Like Janus’ hat is full yellow when he’s super happy and Remus’ outfit turns more… green… Actually no scrap that idea brain’s shut down today folks the thought mill is over for tonight
My every day life :      Oh and I’m really excited for this episode I’ve been waiting it for a months now
Oh my god my heart just melt it in the minute 19:30, that was so freaking cute!
Shut up emo. Hahaha
I would like to have a virgil sometimes, because the number of times such a situation like the one depicted in this episode has happened to me is kind of large. My anxiety isn't a balanced person like good ol' virg, it's more like a mass of negative emotions that stands between me and the person I want to approach, making me unable to go talk to them. This shapeless mass is a mix of all the bad from all the sides, deceptive, mean-spirited, egocentric, overly pragmatic to a point of unrealism, cynical, ect. The main differences between me and Thomas are few but important, and they are: I have one side (the dark mass from before); I am straight; I am below 20; I am not from the states. Those differences make it so that I have less experience in life, I am less balanced, I am part of the "sexual norm" and I live in a different society. Just... just all the times this mass got me thinking "suicide is a viable option" makes me want an honest and protective figure like virgil, but all I have is the mass. If you read this, I thank you and I'm sorry for being so dramatic, depression (undiagnosed too) isn't easy to live with. If you ever find this comment Thomas, thanks for your videos, they keep me alive. Sincerely, an unwell internet user.
sorry, anyone's here shippa virgil x roman ? (sorry for bad english)
"I'unno, plant!"
PLOT TWIST Anxiety is now becoming bravery
THAT WAS SO GOOD OMG
I didnt watch the last episode due to me genuinely losing interest and not having the motivation to try watching it again so im glad to be here again.
This was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen it was so good thank you for this 💜
Ok I feel like Roman and Virgil are like Jason and Nico from pjo/ hoo? Also everything about this made me smile and this was just so wholesome 😊
Wait... WAIT.  Virgil's eyeshadow turns to beautiful purple glitter when he's really happy.  That's really freaking cute.
roman and virgil: *proud parents*
*shipping noises intensify*
I smell a little bit of princiety.. 😶😶😶
Virgil: No- I- Roman: Shut up Emo.
I’m not even interested in this anymore, yet I still watch, just to support.
And there you have it folks! An amazing episode with Thomas being an absolute mess and getting a cute guy! Happy ending for Thomas and Prinxiety shippers! (by the way, this was an amazing episode and REALLY good overall plot, script, and animation)  EDIT: I do NOT ship Prinxiety, but for each his own I guess.
Awwwwww this is so cuute
THOMAS CAN YOU PIN MY COMMENT FOR NO REASON
I asked my gf what she thought Gay eyes were and her reply was rainbow contacts
Cuando van a sacar los subtitulos españoles ;-;
I am lonely and gayyyyy
Amazing!!! ^_^
Roman took the title very seriously            flirting with anxiety
If the guy weren’t gay that would have been so embarrassing 😳
It took me 3 hours to watch this (WONDERFUL) episode
I DONT EVEN SHIP PRINXIETY BUT AHHHHHH THE ENDING
Yes, hello? To whoever wrote the captions Thanks for giving us a name for Virgil’s echo-y voice, and for those who missed it. It’s called: Tempest Tongue
I love this so much
That... was... beautiful. I’m crying. Think I needed that, thx.
THE GAY HAS MY HEART MELTING😍🥰🤪
okay i don’t know if i’m just blind or stupid but i can’t see the change in eye shadow. because i’ve looked and the only reason it changes slightly is because the animators change. please correct me if i’m wrong.
That story is cannon now.
Ahhh so cute!!! I loved the animation, it looked to good!
I LOVE THIS!!!
Omg This was so amazing, it made me tear up in joy
14:20 I died...
The sad thing is when the animatic started an add came on
Now I just need this with a girl 😞
4 years later snd hes still amazing keep it up!
This. was. so. CUTE!!!!!!
F i n a l   f o r m
Nothing but a bruised ego  Roman: *hmm* 😒
I have a girl in my choir class and I know she is pansexual but I can't bring myself to talk to her, baby gay issues. I don't radiate Pansexual energy ¶~¶.
LOVE YOU THOMAS!!!!!!
Is it just me or does the guy remind me of fandom Alexander Hamilton?
Why is this so true
"lil punk ¬^¬"
nightmare before christmas is in both this and in accepting anxiety part two.. did anyone else notice that?
This made me so stupidly happy I can’t explain it
19:39 - 20:05 princxiety shippers are gonna go nuts
Please tell me this is a true story!!
Can we get a gay eye tutorial
I don't often comment on YouTube videos, but with this one, I don't see how I couldn't.... Just... This video was just way too relatable. I often have to deal with the clash between my hopeful aspirations and my anxiety any time I talk to someone new, let alone someone I'm interested in. I'm a clumsy, socially awkward, actually autistic, hopelessly gay nonbinary trans girl, and I have massive anxiety regarding how I am perceived... but seeing videos like this, where I see someone dealing with issues like mine *and succeeding*? They give me hope. So... thank you. ^^
ok, i dont ship virgil and prince but im just gonna say that this video really made the ship stronger
20:46 no one gonna talk bout Remus' face. He looks like he's trying to do that old troll face.
i understand everyone screeching abt the eyeshadow now
"ROMAN YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!" "IF I AM, *I'LL ADD IT TO THE LIST!!"* Are... Are we just not gonna talk about this--?!
Me? Flirting?             I could *_never_* —
Can you react to this video, whether it be on camera or not. https://youtu.be/343W82jYarY The creator of the vid is really good, and it has some awesome tiktoks. Also, love your channel! The characters from Sander Sides are really relatable and your videos just make me so happy! Also my fav is Virgil. I love cosplaying as him!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCCd2HMp23U i found this when i went thru my home page watch it
guess what, this random kid put this youtube video in the google meet lmao
ThEorY:  Virgil says Thomas can only look at Nico for 6 seconds because that is how long Vines are. Thomas's brain immediately did 6 seconds because of Vines without him knowing it-   (if anyone wants to add to this feel free) edit: lol where did yall come from XD ty for da likes?? <3
I dont know why but it was super hilarious, so hilarious in fact I fell out of my chair laughing onto my dog who is fine dont worry I gave him extra ice cubes
i cant watch this without physically cringeing xD liiike this is too much like me i love it 😂👌🏻
i'm sorry but the levels of PRINCIEXTY??? my heartTTTtttttTtTt
I personally am not lgbtq+ in any way, but supportive of it. I loved this so much!!! <3 <3
I LOVE THIS WHHHH you should do more animated ones
There were a lot of feelings on this side of the screen. Thanks😁
HECK YEAH!!! SANDER SIDES!! 💙❤️💜💙💚💛
This made me feel so warm and fluffy inside
Aww I've missed these! Love the artwork!
This is so funny
This is fricking wholesome and I love it!!!
wait o-o your gay? kewl
Broo the trash can part was so funny!!!!
I would join your Pateron but I have no money..So now I'm sad..
I like your sanders sides intro but.... you should change it to include Janus and Remus
I have almost rolled over from my bed watching this!!! 😂 Gosh this is so cute!!!!  ❤️ Relate much :3
GUYS WHAT IF THIS IS THOMAS'S REAL BOYFRIEND AND THE REAL STORY ABOUT HOW THEY MET?! (Please correct me if I'm wrong)
Im lateeee
omg this was cute!
"I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking"  As usual, I've never related to Virgil more-
I've got to get some pins
Omg this is so cute dbsjsnsjjs
Itt was so cute, why am I crying?
This would be the best anime in existence ngl
What's wirh virg's eyeshadow? Do they change color with the emotion?
I wonder how they would have done this in live action
I'm just gonna--  Fffffffffffffffffffrikedy that's cute
I feel like thomas rn. Instead im a highschool and I wrote a note for them instead of talking to them
15:44 deceit says hello!
i thought he was going to call up patton when he was speaking from the heart
The dude in the bathroom tho.......he's going up on my favorite character's wall of fame now. Amazing btw!! I just love this and just put it in my favorite's playlist! >w<
Y Virgil’s eye shadow keep changing colour?
I'm gonna have to start watching this when I need to take a chance lmao
This is amazing. Personally I struggle with this too. I love your content
My favourites is Logan and Patton
I know you won't see this but I have a bit of hope. Can you adopt me?
Rewatching this over and over again, TwT
I game into this video in the middle of a major Panick Attack, and then i stopped crying, and shaking, and practically seizing, and then you almost made me cry tears of freaking cute joy for little animated Thomas (and i would have if my eyeballs weren't so dry). Thank you so much for making me smile in a dark moment <3.
Ummmmm.... Virgil’s eyeshadow! It changed based on his emotions, right?
most frustrating film to watch as an extrovert lol
y'all i got so happy that my name is in this q---p
I love how all three of them went all my god at Nightmare before Christmas sticker
Imma need a lesson on gay eyes, I need to use that lol
" That's like cyber stalking... But real life!" " So... Stalking" "... Oh your right" DEAD. Also, live the art style!!
I love your videos so much you do such a good job
Vigil in purple eyeshadow is adorable
I am highly empathetic and kategelophobic and this hurts
The end had me tearing up, I love this episode
But is he gay  Or European?
i think this would not be good in real life but great as a animaiom witch it is
tHiS iS mE!!!!!!!! sO mUcH mE!!!!!!!
My Beautiful Shippers Heart Has Been Blessed
Spanish subtitles? please? not? okay._.

VIRGILS EYESHADOW holy sh—  Theryre purple!
PURPLE VIRGIL!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
Me trying to give my friends advice
Covert Cobra  :D
Does anyone notice Virgil's Eye shadow was changing when he was happy or exctied  Could it be Virgil is slowly becoming a true light side?
did anyone notice the hearts next to roman as he was looking at virgle SHIP
After this video you can not say that virgel and Roman would not be an adorable couple Edit: Wow 18 likes so many😳😲😵
This whole video is just second hand embarrassment- I love it- It's so cheesey!!🧡 EDIT: This is so cute- I'm gonna cry-
6:13 pause it LOOK AT ROMAN 🥺
I was so engaged in the plot of this, all i want is to be gay and happy
THIS WAS SO WELL WRITTEN AND SO WELL ANIMATED
I have never seen a video and let me tell you, I love it! I have no idea who these people are, but I’m super invested!!! Are these characterizations of your inner thoughts and individual personality traits or multiple personalities? Cool either way!   On to the anxiety! The only problem... I get the courage to talk to them easy. I speak real fast for a minute. And I forget to get contact information. Or a name. And I regret not asking every time.
I need to find a gay friend so I can be emo and princey for them!
I- really. Loved this
Is that legos I see on the table?
I hope theres more of these cause they are sooo adorable plus I really wanna see Patton's and Logan animated
:)
*when i have kids I'm going to assume there gay until they come out to me as heterosexual.*
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
The demon dog...
PINtrovert
So Wholesome 🥺
I'm not crying you're crying
* Cries * I love this And the end of the animatic just made it better
Thanks Thomas you helped me get over some stuff so thanks
I got an ad for Thomas Sanders wile I’m watching a Thomas Sanders
My little gay heart!!!!
Yea, this is cute
Aw yes, the *gay* we've all been waiting for.
So the same thing has been happening to me.  There’s this gorgeous girl in school (she’s openly bi) which gives me the illusion that I have a chance.  I’m in a fight with my best and pretty much my only friend, (specifically about how I don’t know how to make friends and just rely on her all the time.). I’ve been trying to approach her but I’m a coward.  I’ve just been staring at her like a creep during Spanish.  I finally mustered up the courage to say:  “I uhh like your uuhhh hoodie? Yeah” then in band I finally said “okaysoImsorryforbeingsoweirdbutlikedoyouwannabemyfriend?” And then we had to leave and I didn’t hear her reply.  Then during lunch I sat at her table.  She asked me if I wanted to sit with her.  I was about to say yes, but then her friend called from mother table and she went to sit there.  Then today, I purposefully sat at her table again, and she sat there took!  But because of COVID, there are dividers up during lunch, and the way it’s set up is that you can’t see or hear the person sitting diagonally from you.  She was sitting diagonally from me.  I wanted to make a comic about it but now everyone’s gonna think I’m copying Thomas
Virgil smiling is ADORABLE
I love how virgils eye shadows changes why is this our first time seeing it!?!?
THIS WAS REALLY CUTE! The amount of gay panick was overwhelming 💕
This video is actually me when I see someone cute except I don't talk to them
I really like this animatic. Its so much less restricting with which locations you can be in and it allows for the sides to actually be able to touch thomas instead of just having a limb just push thomas. The scene where virgil actually pushed thomas is something I really liked cause it allows the sides to actually physically interact with thomas
Omg. "Gay eyes". Other people do this too???? Y'all for me it's just attempting prolonged eye contact and smiling and then looking away when it's too much for my anxious autistic ass. I didn't know it was a thing. :'D
Wow that hit close to home.  Well done, you made me cry.
Oh my.... This. Is. So. PERFECT 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Were da vines:(
When roman said “shut up emo” I had a gay panic that was such a cute exchange between the two!
:) don't look at this comment
This channel is amazing and you deserve to hit 10 mil you got this!
For some reason i am getting high-key Nico di Angelo vibes from Virgil in this and yes goddammit I’m crossing fandoms again😶
Can you imagine a person relating to this so much but they have never dated because they alwasy fail in social life?...... yeah thats me
*the amount of second-hand embarrassment and anxiety I got from this is unhealthy.* Not that I'm complaining. 🤭 🏳️‍🌈
GIVE JANUS RIGHTS VIRGIL GOD DARNIT
*ROMAN DID GAY EYES AT VIRGIL WHEN HE WAS SHOWING WHAT IT WAS I REPEAT ROMAN DID GAY EYES AT VIRGIL*
Will you post the vid recreated in real life on your channel not just the patrion
"LIVE LIKE JACK AND SALLY" YOOOOO
I love this animation ❤❤❤❤❤
Happy bday sanders sidea
A part of me was hoping it'd cut away to Nico battling with his own sides with having to go up and talk to Thomas to return the food 😂 also I can't wait to see this done live action!!! ❤️
...so ....cute
i’m so single i gotta go to the mall n find a cute girl
Could be gayer
Virgil and Roman had SUCH a cute moment at the end of the animated video!!!!!!! Who else ships them?!😍😍😍😍😍
Nobody:  Virgil: *GAY PANIC*
“Yeah, uh I’m not interested.”  “liar.” “liar.”
Is this a true story thomas?
Thomas don't be sad! :<
This video gives a whole new meaning to the song ‘gay of European’
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHGGHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY FREAKING SHIP
Had a good day today. Hehe! 💘      Huh. Delete it
WHERES PART TWO,,,,,,
PRINXIETY PRINXIETY OH MY GOODNESS MY HEART CANT HANDLE IT
Love dis
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HE'S IN LOVE AND BLUSHY!!!!!
I'm almost 99% sure everyone ships Roman and Virgil.          oh god someone stab me. I just thought of a ship name (someone probably thought of it before me but whatever), Virman. I want to slap myselffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
I felt every bit of the gay panic.
Wait..Thomas I was wondering if you were actually into guys or if it was all just jokes? ;w; If you are not comfortable telling then that is fine,do not stress about it.I am fine with it. :>  I am lesbian btw,and hello
I’m so hyped to see ABDIllustrations. I love their art
Is he gay ?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i love this <333333333
19:58 anyone else notice those hearts?! Prinxiety?! I mean a few episodes ago Princy (Roman) did say he makes fun of things he likes and he makes fun of Anxiety (Virge) ALL the time!!
Did Thomas get what I think he got-
AH! DEMON!
I got an ad by Janus, is this a sign?
Roman and Virgil having a heartfelt moment: *colgate ad pops up and is in spanish for some reason* me: 👁👄👁
i wanna get the patreon but im so broke- :(
Prinxiety is probably canon in this video
Flirt or fight  me a lesbian  BOTH  Nothing is more gay than slowly tilting your lovers chin up with a sword
This reflects my social anxiety and why I where headphones all the time in the offices and stores
oh my I loved this so much it felt like I was watching an anime :)
My heart broke when he was leaving and tHEN I JUST, HE TALKED TO HIM ANDODNGKSOGOEKGYES SO CUTE
"Gerard Gay" I'm dieing😂
Thomas is hot xD definitely power bottom vibes 🔥 🔥 🔥 😅
Me watching this while sobbing because i relate to it so much: wHYYYY- theendinghadmesobbingevenmore- whyamisuchasappynonbinarychild-
BRO I JUST GOT A AD OF JAN JAN .. that got me excited XD
I simply *cannot* stress on how much I relate to this
Thomas: Patreon! Me: Shut up n take my non existant money cuz im young n unemployed!
I have been wondering this for a year. Are you gay or not I am so confused
i NEED M O R E
I love the mcr puns
Agh, How dare you make me tear up with cute happy things 😂😅
ThE KING HAS RETURNED
Its so cuuuuuuttteeee🥺
I keep thinking about this theory so here it is: have a feeling that anxiety is logics dark side. The theory rn is that he used to be paranoia as dark sided so I’m thinking that a possible opposite of logic could be paranoia. Also they haven’t shown logics dark side yet(which could still happen)-idk I could be totally wrong but I’ve just got a feeling about this.
his eyeshadow ssssoooo cute
I just noticed. At 6:29  5 microphones, 1 braincell
why have I only clicked on this today this is so amazing xDdDDD ♥♥♥
You guys should make Virgil more happy I love his eyeshadow and this was to cute😍
I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. That was amazing y’all did such a good job this episode ( as always 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽) the ending team meeting.
Yikes.  I wish I couldn't relate😓
The Gerard Gay thing had me laughing harder than I should've
Ya know what Thomas this video made me want to go and confess to my crush! You will probably not see this comment but if you do thank you. And worse case scenario she says no and it will be ok and try to still be friends..... thank you again... 😊❤️
Pulling on my heartstrings!!!
I wanna join the patreon bUt I LiVe In ArGeNtInA
Sanders sides should be a disney show. Thomas is basicly a disney character.
i felt this entire episode in my soul except for the part when they started talking to eachother
I don't think Virgil has ever been this happy before! It makes me tear up! 😭
damn i don't wanna *relate* to someone with social anxiety i wanna forget i have it thomas
AAA I didn’t know you were still posting!!!
The title of the episode should be ”flirting with gay panic”
Hey I actually saw this through another YouTuber and it was so cool I would love to see it made in real life when it is safe though but Thomas stay your Gay self because you have my support all the way.
I cannot wait for the next video😂 the ending killed me.
Im sorry but i ship prinxiety
I LOVE Virgil, Im planning on cosplaying as him!
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
Why did this also feel like my last two brain cells trying to tell someone that I think they are pretty,cool, or just that I accidentally caught feels in like 20 seconds
Who is Gavin?
I felt so much metal stress in this video it is not even funny all to see a prinxiety moment?    It was totally worth it
I love that Thomas talks about his patron at the end and in the middle I got the add- ALSO PRINCY AND EMO I LOVE THEMMM
Sweetheart, you don't need love you need yourself. Love will let you down and you might get hartbroken from it.
Hold up did this actually happened cuz if it did I am so happy for you!!
I just realized that Virgil's eye shadow turns purple when he's happy and black when he's not happy
Me: *Wanting Virgil and Roman to kiss*  Thomas: and there you have it  Me: Nnnuuuu
OMFG VIRGIL IS SO ADORABLE IN THE END AHHHHHHHH
Ong this was so cute! I related so much I cried. Absolutely amazing!
My heart just melted
This is like inside out but actually INSIDE OUT
What I love most is captions don't say bark they say ruff and it makes me so happy
*t o p o f t h e m o r n i n’ t o y a*.           Also I’m crying-
I get so excited when I see virgil's eyeshadow purple EEK- HES TO PRECIOUS
Ogm I love it so much it made my heart smile and feel so warm 😊
You should do more of these I loved this
I saw myself in this so much that there were points I had to pause and take a breather because I was so embarrassed
Throughout this whole thing Roman has been a big mood. Periodt
Who else starts grinning at “what is up everybody?!” Every time?
we all know virgil, you love him
Awwwwwww you guys I'm crying it so cute and adorable like it cute I'm gonna die
This was amazing, your content always brings a smile to my face.
“I don’t want me to be doing this either.” Do I spot a John Mulaney reference?
THIS IS SO DANG ACCURATE AHAHAHHAHAHS
*sigh* cutie at 12 o’clock  AHAAAAA
Why          WHY IS THIS SO CUTE          LITERALLY ANYTHING ROMAN OR VIRGIL DO THAT IS TOUCH RELATED MAKES THE MOMENT FEEL LIKE PRINXIETY  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this so muchh
This was so cute and adorable. I Iove you Thomas and thanks to you and the other animators who created this. Love watching your videos.
I’m so proud of our resident emo!! 😭
Yay new episode :>
My respect for Thomas went ⏬⏬⏬⏬
This video dropping whilst I'm currently trying to figure out how to befriend and eventually woo my crush is too much of a coincidence.       Also this entire episode was a mood and I felt it in my soul
I wish I could animated the movements and expressions. P.s this is the 8th time I've watched this video
Ok first...   WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE ANIMATION IN THIS OMG ITS SO CUTE AND COOL AAAAAA >^< I LOVE THIS >^<    Secondly...  Shipping to the fullest *^* just aaaa my little bi heart is jumping twenty million miles an hour >^<   Just...this animation touched me in more ways than one just like of corse your other videos ...   So thank you thomas sanders.For just existing and giving us lauphter and hope with every video ;^;
10:35 ..... Roman noooooooo-
.... I might have to write a gay love story cause of the ending
The ending of this was SO CUTE AHHHHHH
I love how literally NO ONE is talking about the carrots🥕😂  Omg really cute story, Thomas! I squealed at the end😁🥰
THE BEGINNING WAS A PUN!!  You can call me Thomas if you wanna get--  *ruff*
I have mixed up feeling about this happy and excited then again sad because there  might not be a part 2 😭
Aww Thomas we try to help as much as we can even if it’s just Subscribing to the Channel or buying March we will try to help you and I love that sampler side 👌🏼

I was so overwhelmed by the cuteness at the end that my sister asked what I was doing
Oooooooo! This is probably the best Patreon content I’ve ever heard of. I’m so excited!! I hope I can be involved :)
HOW DID YOU NOT TALK ABOUT THE NEW EYESHADOW!!!
HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY
Ikr
Idk why but "search for treasure for good measure" had me wheezing
This actually got me a little emotional for some reason. Thank you for such amazing content!
Virgils eyeshadow!!!!
OMG this is to funny
THE BLINK 182 REFRENCE
Thomas: he'll be better off without me Me: *in tears* The ad that shows that moment: GET A BRAND NEW FREE AUDIO BOOK-
I love this
16:22 did he say “ mind telling me about..them?”
ok first i love the art style, second I LITERALLY LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS and i can relate talking to people with social anxiety
The wholesomeness of this video is to much to handle!!
5:34 AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THOUGHT THAT WAS CUTE?!
okay but like the purple eyeshadow when hes happy and the black when hes anxious is a nice touch. thomas really do be out here bringing us the details
HOW DID I ONLY JUST NOW FIND OUT THAT THOMAS IS OLDER THAN ME?! 😳
I'm not tearing up- you are
I actually cried....I-
Also everyone who isn’t already a Patreon and can afford it should just go do the $25 level. I just looked at the reward. Sticker. Think about it. Clandestine meetings of TS fans. What?! You thought your boss hated you and is plotting your downfall? Look! They’ve got a TS sticker! Gosh golly gee whiz, there *must* be something redeeming about them as they sure do have good taste! 😉
So when Anxiety’s happy his eye shadow changes colour?
this is the most prinxiety sanders sides video /p
If I see this in live action I might cry, I love this, favourite episode so far 🥰
HES BACK AGAIN
YAYYYYYYY GAYNESS >:)
Thomas ur gonna make me cry I swear
I’m sad, I’ve been busy and was barely able to watch this
Turn to God if you haven’t already! He loves us and sent His only son to die on the cross so we can be forgiven and be with God ❤️
Is Virgil an afton???? 🤔 plz tell meh ;-; I need to know! Am tired
AHHHHHHH THAT WAS SO FLIPPING CUTE 🥺💓
-wipes away single tear-
THOMAS SHIPS ANXIETY AND PRINCEEEEEE NO CAP
OMG that was so cute and sweet 😍🏳️‍🌈
oh no i almost cryed! thank you Thomas
"Is that fair to him?"  HIM as in DECEIT or HIM as in THE GUY?!?!?  Edit: I'm taking this as a double meaning until the day I die.
"I dunno....plant."  I felt this on a spiritual level
ok so inside out x sander sides virgil: fear patton: joy and sadness roman: disgust logan: anger
I've finally worked up the courage to watch this. Wish me luck y'all.
Can’t wait for the Halloween episode (if it gets made)
LLLLLOOOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEEE IIIIITTTTT
Am I the only one who thinks thomas was inspired by a simulator situation?
LUSH CHRISTMAS BATH BOMBS RULE!!! 🧼🛁🎄🎁🎈🎉
OKAY-  THIS EPISODE IS REALLY CUTE. oml-
Finally a new vid after 4 mounths TwT
me through this entire thing watching it and reading the comments: indescernible fangirl screeches and screams
OH YAY FINALLY ANOTHER UPLOAD AFTER A LONG TIME
That was so cute! My gosh- 🖤❤️
When you watch a youtube video and they mention a youtuber/artist that you know your all like waaaa they know each other... waaaaa
as someone with pretty bad social anxiety, i felt this on a spiritual level. really really really loved this!!
When you realize sanders sides was based off of inside out 🤔🤯
My favorite part out of the whole thing. 22:58
"Will deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems?" Janus: *pops up* you called?
WHY AM I CRYING?! OMG I'M NOT OK
Thomas!! The link to Erin's Instagram in the description is broken!! :(
This...is so...cute–!
This video IS gay panic. I’m on my moms phone.
ugghh i was so hopeful i thought this was a prinxiety episodee aahhhh    i still love this episode tho 💖💕
Happy Virgil equals lighter eyeshadow!
16:56 dat face doe
"Punk... Lil pUnK" -Thomas Lol . . Everytime they all freak out about that dude is the best XD
That was so cute
Can we all agree,seeing virgil excited and happy at the same time is one of the most cutest things ever OwO?
THAT WAS THE CUTEST THING I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE!!! That was so fun 💖😆💞 Oh my god thank you for that
They all have they own corner though, wow, value.
I'm internally screaming on how amazing this is!!!! And the art style i love it!!!! You guys did a wonderful job!!🌈
Am I the only one who had a gay panic attack just from watching it?
Oh my heart, I have fallen in love with a series!
The accurate title of this video: *gae*
DAWWWE
This episode is too pure for us to handle 🥺💜
Wow! Left me stunned. Bravo!
Ahhh I loveee itttt!!!!!! I’ll def want to watch a live action version.ahhhh I can’t wait. So adorable
Y is this like so me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this so much
Lol I saw the patreon add right before this
Does anyone else think that we should have Virgil and Roman react to Prinxiety, Logan and Patton react to Logicality? Or whatever ships you like. Idc honastly. I just think all the sides should react to the ships.         Please dont ask why I commented this on this particular video
The fact that I’m watching a thomas sanders video and a thomas sanders ad popped up- I’m speechless
so dat means you got a bf
GERARD GAY KRGJNDKJGB I- 💀💀
Never have I smiled at a video so much That was so adorable virgils eye shadow changing was really cool because it shows us just how much he has grown. Him and roman were working together and it just shows they they are becoming close as well virgil saw roman was upset and he did something that was really scary for him to do push Thomas to talk to Nico. and after they were all so happy Virgil smiled openly and didn't cover it up like he usually does. I really love his development though this series
I ship Virgil and the handsome prince guy
Nico is excellent I love him and I love LOVE Virgil being brave and I SUPER love this episode being an animatic and Thomas’s old jokes are just so funny  In addition Virgil instructing Thomas to fidget in excitement is so perfect lol
Virgil eye showed!!!! It kept changing does it mean something am freaking out!!!!
Is it just me, or is Virgil being much more of a doof in this episode?? Cause I love it! (Sorry I’ve been rewatching this too many times)
This was so cute!! I loved this!!
It is my theory that there are two sides left to be introduced, and I am in the form belief that they will be based on the modes of persuasion that haven't been used, ethos (ethan) and kairos (Kai), ethos being a light side. and kairos being a dark side
#prinxtiety
THE BATHROOM STALL ONE I FELT SO MUCH OMG
I really wanna become a patron I have the money but I'll feel guilty if I become his patron and not someone elses 😭
all of the jokes at the beginnings of your videos aren't made by roman but they're made by remus and I stick by that.
This is something I never thought I needed :')
This is my life in a nut shell, just remove the ending and it’s an exact replica lol
THIS EPISODE GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK AND THEN TEARS OF HAPPINESS   I don’t deserve you, Thomas, your productions are so incredible and have taught me so much about myself! I’m who I am today thanks to you!
Can we please make gay eyes a thing
Xxx pert   Hold up-
*PRINXIETY*
me in the beginning: oh no, Roman and Virgil are agreeing and working together, that cannot end well
I SAW HEARTS BETWEEN ROMAN AND VIRGIL OMG  ALSO VIRGILS NEW MAKEUP OMG!
"emphasis on the old"
I think I started crying 👁👄👁
Back again, and this is still so cute!
That was adorable.
aahhhhhh best ever❤️❤️
I clicked on this video and got a Thomas sanders ad lol
MY HEART- I LOVE THIS SO MUUCCCHHHHHHH
VIRGIL IS A GRYFFINDOR CHANGE MY MIND
Welp... I cried... Thomas I love this soooomuch!!!
Just now got to watch this... The tears won't stop 😭😭😍😍
Why is this so relatable lmao the animation is also so good!!!
This was absolutely lovely... like am I kind of crying yeah but it’s fine
THIS NEEDS TO BE AN ANIME OMG THAT WAS CUTE!!!!!!
VIRGILS EYES HIS EYES WHAT I AHHHHHH HE WAS HAPPY AND THE SHADOW WAS PURPLE
OMG THOMAS UR SO CUTE  loved the vid
THIS IS SO CUTE IM CRYING
i work at a movie theater and to avoid that awkward "you too" I just say "have a good one."
"idk PLANT"
its so wholesome how much the sides genuinely care about thomas and you have to respect it too since they're literally part of him and doing  amazing at their jobs <3
Was Virgil blushing at Roman at the end or was that just from embarrassment? And the hearts from Roman, were they for Virgil or for being happy and proud of Thomas? Im genuinely curious.
I can just imagine that Logan and Patton are just sitting in a corner, eating popcorn.
as an animator seeing this makes me so incredibly happy, even as an animatic it takes a lot of work!!! And I've always thought your acting was perfect for voice acting, and I don't know I think animation brings so many oportunities to a series like this, I love it!!!!!!!!
What happened to your Best Vines YouTube channel ? you never uploaded since 2 years ago also your other vines channel you haven't uploaded so what happened?
the epidose ive been waiting for-
Thomas being straight in old vines  (me) “falsehood”
Dude did anyone else get the Thomas Sanders ad
YALL IM CRYING THIS IS SO AMAZING AHAJHSKABANA
I loved the animated version so much. Please keep doing them!
It's so cute! my heart!
I'm not crying you are
Spittake that I threw at my friend: There is no forth emotion, there is Patton/Janus, Roman/Remus and the names bounce off each other with the 'on' and 'us' ending aside from Virgil, and instead there is Logan/Virgil (and logic does also clash with others including light side); but now Virgil is both Anxiety with a bit of bravery, Virgil is both dark and light side.
Dat shove tho
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD THIS WAS SOOOOOOOOO CUTEEEEEEE
i like how roman and virgil had their own cute gay moment at the end of the animation is tugged my heart strings Aaaghh—
My little prinxiety heart loved this video so much
With the Patreon that you pay 25$ how do you know if you were one of the first 1,000?
It’s bad that This happens to me all the time
WHY DID NO ONE MENTION THE PURPLE PURPLE EYES PURPLE EYES PURPLE EYES
the title made me think he was gonna flirt with virgil for a sec
Beautiful story, great art, but I think I'm just gonna stick with "Gay Eyes" for now😭❤
I was squealing  at the end **"PRINCXIETY"*
So this didn’t really happen if it didn’t I’m sad and if it did I’m happy for you
Most are talking about Virgil's eyeshadow but l never seen his eyeshadow in the whole video...
THE PRINXIETYYYYYYYYYYY 😳🥺😍
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD I’VE BEEN WATCHING U FLR YEARS NOW AND THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY♡´･ᴗ･`♡
i love this
Oh my gosh that was so cute!!! And the most accurate representation of gay panic I've ever seen...
I HATE BEING BROKE. I NEED THAT SHIRT.  Virgil: what if things are never gonna be the same again?  Me: THE WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
When Thomas asks if they're ready for this and Virgil's makeup got darker again... I felt that so hard
I think the lier guy is getting pretty annoyed
AAAAAAAA This Ep was su cuuuteee my heart kept Pumpinnnnnn I weirdly felt the nervousness and the feeeelsssss 🥺
Did anyone else notice virgil's eyeshadow kept changing
"What are you doing?" "I dunno....plant."
I keeped say "GO GET HIM BOYO YOU HAVE A CHANCE"
I have watched that endcard what must have been 20 times by now and I just now realized that Virgil’s voice echoes for a second when he yells “AH! DEMON!”
OMG VIRGIL BEING THAT HAPPY JUST ALMOST MADE ME CRY!! THE AMOUNT OF SEROTONIN RIGHT NOW 💜💜💜💜
Please let this be based on a true story
i was having a bad morning then i watched this- i squealed-
🥺🥺🥺🥺 The storyline is so precious. And so beautiful 🥺🥺🥺🥺
What? No. I’m not crying. You are.
OH GOD A CONFIRMED PRINXIETY SHIP!!!!!!!! OH FU**K
I'm late but this is beautiful! ❤️ I think I fall in love with Virgil everytime I see him. *Googles how to adopt my emo kid Virgil*
Thomas Sanders making me go through my gay panic all over again
This basically sums up me trying to talk to any of my crushes
Gerard GAY lololll
I love Virgil's classic Introverted thinking for like everything lol  also, keep it up, your all doing a great job!
I love every second of this, it's so cute.
Im telling you i literally got an add abt their patreon lol.
How come Virgil is so adorable on this one? He literally had a gay panic and even agreed with Roman a lot. That's so cute. And he knows everything about being an introvert.
In the end card... was Virgil's eyeshadow... GLITTERY?!
I’m so annoyed I stopped watching sander’s sides because I watched haikyuu and h x h again UGH I’m sorry 😭😭
That moment when you realize he’s basically stalking someone witch for me was 6:41
The end of the comic made me cry with the whole Virgil and Roman being super excited about a cute guy and then lowkey highkey flirting like 🥺
Why did that end card hit me SO MUCH HARDER THAN THE WHOLE VIDEO WHAT THE HECK MAN 😂
NICO OMG I'M SO HAPPY
I... i...  I havent watched you since vine was alive OML NOSTALGIA I REALIZED HOW MUCH IVE CHANGED uwaAAAAAHHHHH 😔😞😭
This is so beautiful I’m crying
Nicosanders is my favorite thing now!!!
Ghooooood the secondhand embarrassment started killing me halfway through the video, I will have to finish it later ><;;;
You should do a reaction video where the sides react to ships 😂
What are you doing??? ...I don’t know, plant?
I was having a bad day at the end of a bad week. I was alone in the house I live in, and because of increased lockdown in my area of the UK I had to ring my Dad and explain that I couldn't head down to the south coast to visit him. Aaaaand... he didn't take it well. I've never been the patron saint of sonhood in terms of staying in contact before Corona, and now I've been trying to make an effort I can't, and he understandably took it as me not WANTING to see him, which couldn't be further from the truth.  And then I saw this video, about being brave and facing things, even if you screw up and made mistakes in the past. And it made me smile, gave me hope and the courage to call my Dad and have a real conversation about things.  To summarise that convo; we're now on the same page, and I feel SO much better, as does he.  You did that Thomas, you helped me feel brave. Thank you.
Tbh I'm more of a roceit shipper but *this* …. this is kinda cute-
Myyy heeaarrrtt wad aching the whole time....
This was so adorable!!!
YEEEES
Omg this was so cute... I'm about to cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
is Thomas a prinxiety shipper 👁️👁️
I have watched this three times and it is still great
Great job to the animators and sound design! This video was really cute, and I think animation was the right way to go with this. It’s a creative way to have two sides on camera with you without any awkward cutting or editing. Plus animation allows for more exaggerated movement and expressions, which is great for an episode like this that is so dependent on your different emotions! Great job to everyone who worked on this, the hard work paid off :)
Excuse me sir Thomas but ill be needing more
What software did you use to animate Thomas Sanders?
"Shut up, Emo" AHHHHHHHH MY SHIPPING BRAIN WENT OOP- ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
WAIT! DO VIRGILS EYE BAGS CHANGE NOW DEPENDING ON HOW HE FEELS!?!? DID YOU SEE THAT EUFORIA GLITTER!!
I wish I had money :')
I actually cried I-
Its gay and I love it
That was fantastic 😊 realistic and well written
“Top of the morning to ya!” ;w;
As a bi oriented aro/ace who has social anxiety, I feel this on a personal level
Oooooooooooh MY GOD this was so darn adorable and I adore it so much! My broken bisexual heart can't take it!
I LOVE THIS ANIMATIC. Make more Sander Sides video
I noticed that at the end card, Virgil sometimes had purple eyeshadow beneath his eyes instead of black, and I honestly love it!
AAAWWWWWWWW I LOVE THE ANIMATIC AAAANNNDDDD i kinda wish i could join the patreon T^T
The amount of serotonin i got from this is incredible
Officially my favorite Sanders Sides video and I’m not even into romance
*wanting to join the patron* (Remembers im basically a child and I aight got the money)  Like yea teen but no me child
*eternally screaming* when I saw Roman and Virgil standing next to each other *SMILING* I was like oMg I know these are like Thomas's feelings but its so *CUTE* REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-
7:25   At long last , another yu-gi-oh fan ;w;
IT'S BEEN A WEEK. HOW DOES THIS NOT HAVE EVEN A MILLION VIEWS YET. THIS IS CRIMINAL
" shut up emo" *Smile* AHHHHHHHH OMGGGGGG 🥺🥺 why do i ship it they're like the same personnnnnn HELP
I JUST SAW A COMMERCIAL WITH DECIET AHHH
Love how the hands are drawn💓💓
I started watching this earlier and when i came back i got an ad for his patron
Thomas Sanders I was wondering at 8:00PM if you could play one game off among us with me and some others if I can round them up? (that's if your able to go)*My discord is in my about channel* /Discord:RoseC1490\
This animation, story line and script is the best thing I have watched in a while. Thank you for gracing us with this video!
Awe every time Virgil was happy/excited his under bags would turn ✨sparkly purple✨
I want a part 2 of the antimatic please.
THAT WAS SO CUTE AWHEEEE
You go Thomas you go get your man
i officially identify as a pintrovert and nothing else as of now
THE PARAMORE REFERNCE AHHHH
I love how ur ad comes up before I watch this
can you do another Q&A with the sander sides again but when everything clears up obviouslyyy xx
Virgil and Roman look like such proud dads at the end there
*Bathroom Scene*  Random guy: "No one ever said something like that to me before" My Brain: ...................... "FAKE A SEIZURE!!!"
Ngl that animation was adorable
That was soooo cuteeeeee
anyone else notice vigils eyeshadow changing at the end 👀 like switching from black to purple 22:50
Who felt that “you too ”
Does this mean thomas is GEI
you have outdone yourself and might I say this has brightened my emo side even if by the slightest  bravo you have done the imposible
Oh my god did you make prinxity slightly cannon?!
CAN'T STOP SMILING THROUGH THE WHOLE VIDEO! Great job to the artists and the voice acting this really made my day.
LoL @ Captin BlunderPants😂😂
okay was I the only one screaming at Virgil to run to the boy and then join Roman and virigil on the shut up  peice
Ok but a yugioh pin tho
Aw yes ik all the sander sides shippers are gettinga good happy moment right now
I was kind of hoping this was based off a true story
"Pff- shut up emo."  MY FAVORITE LINE EVER PLEASE GIVE US MORE SUGGESTIVE ROMAN X VIRGIL CONTENT
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay-"  Me: *G note plays* "(quietly) when I was a young boy-"
U sound like a weather man your voice goes up and down and up and middle and down
I kinda relate with this video just besides actually ending up talking to them so big oof
IDK WHAT BEAUTY I HAVE WHITTNESSED BUT IS THE SHIP VIRGL AND ROMAN CANNON?!  Edit: Probs not but imma act like it 😀
Just realized how much he looks like my theater teacher 😂
This entire episode was an absolute gift, but I can’t get over the fact that VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY.   (Also, can we please talk about “You were testing me???” *temporarily dropping the spooky aura and music* “Ah, no no no, I wasn’t testing you.” *tiny smile* “I was just panicking” *immediately goes right back to being spooky again* “No, the UNIVERSE tested you....”)
this is bloody cute aaahhhh
Your awesome Thomas!
THAT WAS SO GOOD,  thank you stay safe and have all my love,
I have social anxiety and honestly a lot of these are pretty accurate lol
The end card is such a mood that’s how I felt whenever I finally convinced myself to ask this cute girl(now my gf) for her number I literally couldn’t stop talking or moving I was so excited yet so nervous😂
Roman: You're going to have to speak from the heart. My phone: *Gets an add with deceit in it* Me: What...?????
WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY OR FLUSTERED HIS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE OMG THATS THE CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD
Can I just say... I love Virgil's eyeshadow at the end, it looks so spunky
This video was so cute and I loved the animation! Also, I love Virgil with the purple eyeshadow!!
Fun fact: My mom says she's been watching Thomas Sanders content since he was in high school.
I was smiling the whole video oh my god 😭🥺
O0o That is beutiful both the art and mostly the romance story ^3^
Ooooooh great, Prinxiety is getting more screen time. Entertaining that it's just here to please the Prinxiety people who still believe that "opposites attract" is real.
How dare you make me cry.
Anybody else notice the change in eyeshadow color for Virgil? I think character development is coming soon~
OMG THIS IS SO AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LIVE ACTION!!!
VIRGIL SAID DECIET LETS ROLL BOIS * every Janus cosplayer ever: pack us and leaves*
Me who's keep on watching because its so gae: *screeching silently* *the scene: I dunno what that was...* GAENESSSSSSSS ITS GAENESSS
This entire video is gay panic.
I loved the ending :)
THIS LITERALLY HAPPENED TO MEEEE
I really want to subscribe but my mom won’t let me but I really want to 😭
Virgil freaking out about a boy is all i needed today <3
Roman shut up jeez it's fine until you start spouting off everywhere
this was so precious oh my god
Jeez- that was adorable and social anxiety- that hit close to home o.o'  But that was amazing animation and voice acting <3  l l l l l v Prinxiety moment 19:39
This is just 24 minutes of Virgil and Roman being the best wingmen
Thomas is gay                     COOL
Princy:But we don't know if he's not gay Thomas: ;-;
Spilling the anxie-tea
Hey guys I think Virgil is my long lost brother cause we act the exact SAME
Omg to tell you I almost cried of happiness 🥺😭😭😭
Please make more sander sides videos
Ughhh this is really telling me to actually talk to that cute guy working at the video game store that I don't know if they're gay
Why does Virgil’s happy boy eyeshadow make me so excited? I love it so much
Nooo I have notifications on and I never got the notification for this video now it’s been 6 days
Virgil👏Is👏Baby👏Boy👏
I've watched this episode like 20 times and I just now realized the reference to Creep by Radiohead at 6:50. I cannot describe the inhuman screech that emerged from somewhere deep within my soul when I finally caught that.
AAAAAH I CANT BELIEVE THIS AMINATIC. ITS SO WHOLESOMEEEE
"shut up emo...." best line
YOUR BACK I MISSED WATCHING YOUUUUUUU 😋😃😁😱😭
No one:  Absolutely no one:  Me after seeing .2 seconds of the art style: THAT ARt sTyle wOuLd bE So cUte aS a lAms aniMatiC  (Any Hamilton fans here? 😂)
“I don’t know-plant” -Thomas Sanders
This video hits home for me.  I get flustered when I see someone i like in person.  I really can't flirt with them in person.  Give me an app and I'm fine, but first time in person I'm a hot mess
BRO MY HEART- THAT LINE- "WELL LETS NOT WASTE THIS ONE"!!! UUUGGGH
This video...omgosh this thing is amazing. I honestly didn't think anything of this video when I first saw the notification, but wow. This is so relatable and motivational. Thank you so much for lifting my tired spirit! <3
I cried a little- 😭 the animatic made it so much better
Me- Wait Sander sides is back? :OO Subbing! (bc i forgot to ;-; )
I HAVE AN IDEA. what if you made the ships reality  by 1, make an episode about self love (if that hasn't already been done) and them loving each other is YOU loving yourself! (sorry if this is a bad idea)  edit: just realized i never said "2" oops XD
Starts at 2:10 (for future reference) And then the end card at 22:20
I love abdillustrates!
ok so like, i few days ago i had a dream that i helped thomas with a video, but i dont have money soooooo sadz timez
I have similar problems lol im bi
That was SOOOOOOOO CUUUUTE! Virgil and Roman are the perfect ship! ❤️
The end killed me 😵😭👁👄👁
*fangirl screeeee*
“You’re really struggling today” “okay....”
claim you're here before 1 million views. Ticket here.
THE EYESHADOW!!!!!
Thomas: *Struggling to say hi to a cute guy*  Every gay/lesbian or straight introvert or extroverts in some cases watching this channel: I UNDERSTAND
wheres Paton and logan in this episode
The ending with Roman and Virgil was so damn cute!
Did Virgil get new eye makeup?
We know what shippers are having a field day today
VIRGIL HAS ON HIGHLIGHTER OMG OMG
The video went from speak from your heart to a tissue commercial. That was amazing
I cried
Where’s dad-
Ohw this is so cute I love the art
Why isn’t anyone talking about Virgil’s purple eye shadow when he’s not anxious It’s so goddamn beautiful 💜
I haven't squealed as much as I did today in this video 😂 It was amazing!!  Not gonna lie, when Roman touched Virgl's shoulder I died x.x
Princey: gasp* Shut up! Emo: Shut up! Me: Shut up!
22:35            23:17             23:22           24:01 His EYESHADOW!!  Virgil's eyeshadow is changing depending on his mood!!!
The whole time I was thinking *it's so cuuuuuuttteeeee*
Virgil has PURPLE EYESHADOW!! WHATTT!!!!
What an adorable whole heartly cute story Love it this kind of romance xD
Can someone call Netflix for Thomas
"LIL PUNK" I love it
ARE WE REALLY NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW CHANGES ACCORDING TO HIS MOOD?!??!??!  COME ON, PEOPLE!!!!
I wish I got the Virgil jacket but it’s gone now 😢
Was virgil have a panic attack when he looked at Roman or?   17:09
"We can live like jack and sally if we want"   i see u. The emos see u.
this made me so happy
You are my sisters  idle and she is getting married soon that doesnt mean anything in this comment but great work
Why is this the most relatable video ever
This should be called: The introverted gay, the proud gay, and Thomas try to get a boyfriend. ( Also I love sander sides and this is amazing) 😊
Did this actually happen?
Third time here, maybe😏
I am lesbian, but also poly. So I swear I wanna date every girl I come across but I am HORRIBLE at flirting...
I'm being Virgil for Halloween
i love breathi- *thomas saunders exists* me: stops
I don't have any money so I can't do much to help you financially sorry thomas
Thomas I was wondering do you sell Virgil's jumper because lately I've been trying to find one
I read some of these comments while Thomas was doing the intro and got even more excited about the video 🤣
The way he says “oh you know that’s probably because I was trying to see your backpack is fucking hilarious.
HOLD UP HOLD UP HOLD UP! DID HE JUST SAY HIS NAME WAS NICO? AND,DID VIRGIL DO SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE A G A I N FOR THOMAS AND ROMANS HAPPINESS?!?!
Two cute beans
Roman: You need to speak form the heart. Me: So we need Pat
Videos thumbnale: gay or nay Me: IM GAY
The switching between the black eyeshadow and the purple eyeshadow 👀
Wait!!!!!?????  Virgil and Roman are in a relationship?
19:39 - 20:00   Me: OMG YESS PRINXIETY!! *SCREECH*
AWE THIS IS SO CUTE OMFG
I can smell the gay panic in the air. This is beautiful, it's literally when I see someone cute...but I'm a coward ( still working on that).
Im not trying to be rude but honestly the Virgil t-shirt isnt as good as the janus one and im a tinny bit disappointed
This is Roman and Virgil torturing Virgil
My anxiety went 📈📉📈📈📉📈📈📈📈📈📈📉📉📉📉📈📉📉📉
“Ughhhh pinteovert”—Roman  At the end.... “Shut up emo”—Roman
MY SONS EYES WERE PORPLE
I SHIP ROMAN AND VIRGIL SO HARDDNDJSJSNDNENDJRJRJDJFNFJ
“NeVaDa?” “AnAcOnDaA”
honestly the dialogue in this is hella spot on like damn  AND THE MOMENT??? I SCREAMED
WAIT THE END. SHUT UP EMO. THE HEARTS. IS TAHT. GAY ?!?!??! GAYS TOGETHER ?!?!? WAIT A MINUTE
why is everyone so mean in this episode lol
Virgil changed his eyeshadow!!
I SMELL PRINXIETY
Thomas: I gotta stop wooing strangers in bathrooms.  You mean this has happened before!?
This both hurts me and amuses me on a relatable level, especially with the awkwardness lmao
I like that Virgil's eyeshadow goes glittery-purple when he's happy, that's what I call quality content
are we not gonna talk about the Radiohead reference orrrr
Virgils eyeshadow....🥺
Wait so nobody’s gonna talk about when Virgil gets excited his eyeshadow turns from black to a glittery purple? No- okay ._.
Why. Is. This. So. Wholesome. I. Love. It.💕✨💕✨💕 Keep it up Thomas!
The scream near the end was so cute! And virgil's eyeshadow changed when he got excited!
Roman: What are you doing!?!? Thomas: I DUNNO!?!?! PLANTS!!!! Lolllllllll
omg this was so cuteeeee to watch I ended up screaming and then my mom yelled at me.... but I was so happy I watched this video and you made it
Omg I love this channel  Edit: I don’t know if he explained this but is this the only thing they will be doing with the sides or are they doing the old sides stuff to? I can’t tell lol...
*I feel nervous for him*
"Shut up emo" hit me😂😂😂
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE END WITH VIRGIL AND ROMAN GETTING ALON! BFKSUFNDKDHELDNFJOSIE
"the consatusions a mess" "so it needs a mendment"  "it's full of CoNtRaDiCtIoN"  "so is independencewe have to start somewhere" "no, no way"  10:34
When he said "speak from the heart" I thought Patton was going to show up in the mirror--
Have you ever heard "Thank you, Anxiety " by Avenue Beat? It perfectly describes Thomas's relationship with Virgil in the first few Sanders Sides videos.
AAAAAAWWWWWWW~        FINALLY SOME PRINXIATY
YOU SHOULD HAVE  A PART 2
I was panicking for him the entire time
This makes me cry in the end, and I- I'm so happy. This is perfect, beautiful, it touches EVERYTHING, I love it so much. I need more pins on my bags. I love pins.
This was amazing!!!! And I’m so happy to see ABDIllustrates on it after his Sanders sides video!!!! Oh my god!
“If you don’t have anything nice to say... you’re a dirty liar” - Roman
Thomas, I really want to join the patreon, but I have no money. So when I do get money, I will join! And I also REAAALLY LOVED the video!!!! Also, did this happen in real life?? or is it just the script.
When Patton and Logan aren’t there.
Roman: *tells the embodiment of anxiety to relax*  Virgil: DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX
ROMAN X VIRGIL XTXUFUXF
Now.... See this episode knowing that only Thomas see virgil and Roman ;w;
this didnt even come in my sub box until the 16th omg
You know I wish we could buy a Virgil sweatshirt.
You know I wish we could buy a Virgil sweatshirt.
Bro you got me entrance in the story when the love interest was walking away I was on the edge of my seat saying go go try! But as someone who also suffers from social anxiety I get it big me to moment
AHHHHHHH THIS GAVE ME LITTLE BUTTERFLIESSS!!!!!!
Deadass whenever I see a new Sanders Sides episode I have to actually binge all of them cuz I completely lose the story lmao  But bruh this was so cute
THEYRE SO GAY ITS THE CUTEST FREAKING THING AHHHHHHHH MY GAY LITTLE HEART!!!!!!
i want this to be real life 🥺🥺🥺
I love how Virgils eyeshadow changes to purple every time he's excited
Does anybody else feel bad for bathroom guy?
me at the mall with my friend: spots a cute girl: :O friend: omg ask her out me: what!? we don’t even know if she likes enbys friend: but you’re ignoring the one key thing, apple, we don’t know is she DOESN’T like enbys
I have a video idea!   The most cases with me and maybe a lot of other people anxiety takes over what I do like my creativity wants I don't know. Maybe do something fun but my anxiety comes up with him in the excuses to do it  So if you haven't done this already could you maybe do it episode where overcoming some of your fears?
I.... really wanna make an animation of this with me and my boyfriend TT
Ok things that I haven't seen other people comment about 1. VIRGIL LOOKS SO CUTE WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! 2. MORE JANUS STUFF!!!! 3. Uh oh, Virgil at the end. FORESHADOWING!!!!!! Ok thats all I got. X3
i'm still tooo curious about Virgil's past dknfowjebfw
I didn't expect anything this beautiful from thumnail saying gay or nay
to the 594 people who disliked  ---- ----                                                        _______
Lol 5 days after u upload YouTube decides to let me know
How is an episode has a speech about lying, that even uses the word deceit, not have him in the episode?
For the love of God, please tell me SOMEONE noticed the little add-on at the end where Virgils “makeup” was a bright purple while he was happy, and turned back to black once his mood changed?  It’s a simple detail that was definitely added on purpose.
O my god I missed you thomas😭😭😭😭😭 Edit: I legit burst into tears when Roman and virgil started talking, I missed you guys so much😭😭😭😭😭 I'm gonna cry again😭 Edit:2  The prinxiety and gayness in this video just filled my fujoshi heart with euphoria and I want to s c r e a m💖🍉
OM GOSH THE LEGEND IS BACKK!
I see that blink-182 referance.
“Gay, Gay, HES GAY!” I loved that he sounded like he just won charades or something lmfaooo
AAAAWWWWW!
This was the cutest damn episode and my first episode. I love it!
😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is so cutee
22:34  me literally anytime i see one of these videos
Now that's  cannon all we need is Patton and login then we're set
UGGHGG WHY IS EVERYTHING SO EXPENSIVE I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD £4 A MONTH!!!
I don’t know if this was in the animated section but in the live action stinger at the end when Virgil is happy his eye shadow is a very reflective purple. It’s little touches like that that make this show so fun to watch.
Quisiera poner subtitulos o que alguien más pueda pero no aparece ninguna opción. Lloró
Okay but the purple eyeshadow is everything - and when he's all flustered over the cute guy I'm d e a d. God. This is stunning - wholey jeepers aaaaa
This made me realize I can analyze what I should do to just talk to someone at all only to end up in the same situation! QwQ I’ll never be ready when I fall for someone cuz I know I’m gonna fall hard!!!
“He’s better off without me” DEPRESSION TEST AD
Virgil has purple eyes at the end. Is he changing?
Thomas: **announces that he has patreon** Me: **cries in broke**
Dude virgil at the end was so accurate
AHHHHHH MY HEART!!! I CANT!!!!! but i wish Roman and Virgil got together too! BUT I LOVED IT!!!!!
14:42 that is the saddest "oh" i've ever heard
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL- I'M LITERALLY WATCHING THIS AT 1AM.
"You can live like Jack and Sally...like you want." -Virgil
I AM SO EXCITED THIS ANIMATION AHHHHHHH! 🏳️‍🌈😆
wHY AM I CRYING??? IM TOO SENSITIVE MAYBE???
16:09 -16:23  That is the definition of a gay panic ...I should know this happened when ever I see my friend .........yep :>
VIRGILS EYE SHADOW TURNED WHITE AND PURPLE..... I LOVE TTTTHHHHIIIISSSSS
My heart is melting! Omg that was the cutest thing I’ve seen in forever!!😳😳🥰🥰😳
The amount of serotonin this gives me should be ILLEGAL 💜💜💜
Something about the episode being drawn out in a animatic made it more emotional  I cried
Yooo the changing of the eyeshadow when Virgil got excited!! That’s such I cute detail💖
This series gives me so much happiness and it helps me through the though days thank you for making it
I loved this video!! It was so cuuute!!!
This was so cute!!!
this is so inspirational and yeah true love cant happen with lies
THAT WAS SO ADORABLE I loved it
The whole damn video gave me a heart attack! Like 'no don't talk to him!' 'ahh nooooo' 'talk to him now!' 'nevermind, don't!' 'aboard mission!!!' 'awwwwww' 'SHUT UP!' 'no wayyyyyyy' . I said more then this when watching the video but here you go 'which no one ask for 😅'  Also do you guys notice virgin eyeshadow at the end of the video? Whatever it's call.
I love this so muchhh
Virgil's makeup changes depending on whether he's excited or worried.
Gah my spirit was just punched so hard and I can't like not enjoy it. My whole being loved this and just ugh why did I have to get emotions on this
aaaaaa i shippp
wait.. was that a prinxiety moment at the end??! EHEHHEHEHEHEHHE
I started tearing up Virgil you cutie
This is literally just gay panic
This video is full of gay panic and I love it
Animated Thomas: starts to execute "gay eyes" YouTube: AD TIME!
This is adorable!!
Let's play a game! It's called "how many times did you have to pause the video because the second-hand embarrassment was to damn strong?"
This hit the feels, too relatable👍. Except for the part where he actually talked to a stranger, I haven't done that lol😅.
VIRGIL GETS PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN HE'S HAPPY OR LOVE SICK IT'S SO COOL!
thomas ? gay?
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
I really love this series so much but at the end omg virgils eyeshadow and just omg I just can’t 💕💕💕💕
Virgil is a representative for both light and dark 1-He use to be a dark and changed to light  2-As you see at the end of the video his eyeshadow went from black to a light purple 3-At the end of the video he was acting extremely Excited about what happened  4-He went past himself and push Thomas to do something even if he was worried about the outcome
The scene where the guy brings Tomas's food over is the DEFINITION  of a gay panic 😂😂😂
Okay, but this was SO CUTEEEE
Ahhh this was great! Reminds me a bit of In a Heartbeat!
MY HEARTTTT
who do you ship the sides with tho
VIRGILS EYESHADOW JFJHXHCHDHFHFBXYDYDHSH
Virgil happy and positive thinking: purple eyeshadow  Virgil negative thinking: black eyeshadow   🥺🥺
OMG THIS WAS BEUTIFUL, I LOVE IT 😻
I’d rather listen to anxiety and run away gawddddd ;-;
Is this based on a true story🤔😑
I cringed so hard bc animation u was just being so cringy with that mushy stuff
Props! I was laughing so hard 😂 and it was so wholesome☺ (not sure i wrote that correctly 😅)
This is so CUUUUUUTE, watch me be wrong
This episode had some major pricxitey vibes lol I can’t spell
I'm late noo and hi I love your vids so much
Thomas’s full speech I’m the restroom: “Look, I know this is awkward and maybe not the best place to strike up a conversation. I don’t really know what to say to you. I honestly don’t know what I’m doing it at the mall today. I don’t know what I was looking for. I guess that answers my question. The mall is where you go if you want something, which you don’t know what it is because the mall has everything, right? I don’t know. I don’t know a lot about anything. Least of all myself. And I feel that the hardest when it comes to knowing what I want. But I know that I want to take a chance and talk to you. I have to because I don’t know when I’m going to know know what I want again. And I know that if I don’t act on these feelings right now, I’m going to regret it. I saw you across the food court and you were so...radiant. I saw you, and I just knew.”
Is anyone else gonna talk about how Virgil's under eyeshadow changes?!?! It's purple when he is excited and happy and black when he is nervous or overthinking. That is such a cool touch on their part.
Okay can we talk about the second hand anxiety this radiates. Omg that's literally just me me! Up to the last second of the video! We stan. (and prinxiety omg baybees)
This made me laugh and cry and feel all the emotions. Thank you for this.
I saw literally every twist in here coming and still loved it.
AHHHHHH!!!!! AM FANGIRLING ;-;....but yas
*A cute guy talk to Thomas*  Thomas: *Gay Panic*
*that's rough buddy*
VIRGIL IS BACK I REAPEAT VIRGIL IS BACK
Roman has been spending time with Logan and you can tell.
i’m new to sanders sides/asides um
“Please relax.” WELL NOW IM GONNA RELAX EVEN LESS
“A lot of love was put into this episode.” Me, sobbing: WE CAN TELL.
THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS ART THIS AR-
The first thing i thought when i saw the title "wait Prinx-"
MY HEART.
This was so cute!!!
*explains the song*  “You .. saw me walk into that trash can didn’t you” “THAT WAS YOU”  ... I love that
Virgil is me trying to socialize with anyone
I relate to this part so much 6:35 I got embarrassed for myself cuz I had this happen to me 😭
I really like how virgils eye shadow turns purple when he's happy, I didn't catch that at first
"Thomas, you have to speak from the heart"  Ad plays  _time to step up prep up and protect from HIV_
The part where they were like "Yay he's gay!" Reminded me of 'Gay or European' from Legally Blonde... and I love that intentional or not
My inner Virgil has released all of his energy upon me since I can't get Patreon and I love Sanders Sides TwT
OH MY GOD HE POSTED *BRUH WHOLESOME*
Does this mean his anxiety is getting better?
This means people are going to ship virgil and Roman even more... GREAT
When I saw the thumbnail the first time, I thought: OOOOHHHHH ITS ABOUT TO GO DOWN PRINXIETY SHIPPERS!!
The end when they get along   Me: Is that a ship I smell
I got all misty-eyed, that was fantastic!
Wait a minute Thomas Sanders is gay is this true or false 🤔🤔🤔
I'm sorry but the end was literally me and my friends once of of us successfully flirts with someone
I thought the title said “ flirting with anxiety “ XD
THIS WAS SO CUTE!!!!! SMILES WERE SPREAD
Oooo Virgil's eye shadow
This video was so wholesome and cute. GREAT JOB TO EVERYONE WHO MADE THIS VIDEO!
Roman and Virgil shippers had this
PRINXEITY!!!!!!!
virgil with that shimmery eyeshadow<333
"Oh, I'm not, uh, stinky" BAHAHA
AGH I LOVE YOU😭
Rip to bathroom guy though
This.. this made my heart happy
"Don't tell me to relax!" I loved that!!😆 WHY IS THIS SO GOOD!!!😆
SOO CUTE
This was beautiful :O
DELAYING A SANDER SIDES VIDEO?!?!?! 2020 HAS TAKEN THIS TO FAR!! Also that was a really good episode! You can see virgls eyeshadow change when he’s feeling brave I think? This was the best episode yet!
OoOoOoooOoOOO the ending made me so happy😁😁😁
You need Sleep/Remy (I think thats the name) in a episode it would be amazing like WE NEED IT SISTER!! Like if you want him too!!!!
GERARD GAY IM SCREAMING
Love how Virgil's eyeshadow keeps changing at the end lol
It only just dawned on me that Virgil would be the fusion of Hitoshi Shinsou (from My hero academia) and Nico di Angelo (from Percy Jackson) And prinxiety is basically Shinkami
Dammit Susan didn't notify of your new video
EDG SDHD FJSGHjbb SO CUTE OMGHELP
The mcr reference djdnsndkd
Meco or neco but I love the name Meco
Am I the only one who was waiting for Roman x Virgil-
I absolutely LOVE sanders sides skits and I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. You broke all expectations and brought me to tears and laughter. Thank you.
WE NEED A LIVE ACTION ONEEEE!
“No man” “no it’s Roman” 😂😂😍
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Have the Prinxiety fans hit yet?? 😂
This video made me screech VERY loudly lol
Prinxiety
That was ADORABLE
“Gay eyes?” “Gay eyes” “Alright... What are Gay eyes?”  “ *screeches* HE WAS SCARED YOU LEFT”
Did anyone cry or is that just me?
"And i-i egh don't know hehe" i felt that i try to talk and that's all that happens... >-3->
this is just- YeS! Can we see more videos like this in the future?
Did anyone else notice that during the end (when theyre irl) when Thomas says he tweeted about Nico (and then proceeds to read the tweet aloud) Virgil's eyeshadow momentarily switches back to the dark black we're used to (22:58)? and it stays like that until 23:10
Me: wow I’m FINALLY out of my sander sides phas- Again me: .-.     Oop-   I truly am V.  I love my anxiety-
My heart aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh ❤🥰
OK so I get why anxiety is a prime candidate for going out of your house and seeing your cute guy, but Roman is supposed to be creativity, or is he more like passion in the spot, so then why was he visible even before Thomas saw the guy, what could Thomas have possibly been passionate about when he was going to the movies?
So is this based on a true event or what?
ily=I love you ilysm= I love you so much sue= shut up emo
so as someone new to the channel (i didn't realise the "vine guy" - as i knew him - had a youtube, but i love him).... are these scripted, fictional bits, or is it real, cause this was so unbearably cute and relatable and funny that if this is true i may die  also as a nonbinary, the outro was really nice to hear
Well I love all this GAYyyy
💉Poison them out of love 💉
Dude I just 😭 Thomas is so freaking precious, and this animation is so sweet, wkdjwijwkwjdiej I'm so thankful for this video. I hope it didn't stress the team out too much 🥺
am I the only one just waiting for roman to kiss virgil?
Can you try do monthly I might go insane
me at the end: *PRINXIETYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY* \ Roman x Virgin *Cough Cough*
This video came out at a great time because I recently got a boyfriend and this is very relatable *(especially the stalking part)* I love this video
anyone notice the eyeshadow's purple until he said delete it?
"I unno.. plant..?" Honestly same
THIS WAS SO CUTE AND AMAZING AND DRAWN SO WELL!!!!
I am not gay but I feel so bad for him that he can’t tell this man how are he feels it’s hard to express her emotions but again I don’t know if this is a skit or if this was a real thing that happened to Thomas so I can really go off of anything but I think that whole like sweet thing that was going on the bathroom before that weird dude showed up was pretty sweet
You should do another Q&A video with the sides again.
Aweeeee, so cute! I wanna see real life Florence! Or how the name now is spelled!  AND OMG VIRGIL'S MAKE-UP TURNED GLITTERY WHEN THINKING OF THE LOVE OF THOMAS LIFE
What I find most interesting about this episode was the ending. I noticed how Virgil's eye makeup changes based on how anxious he is. When he is super hyped and excited with everyone else, it's light purple, but when he gets really anxious, it goes completely black and reaches farther down his face. Awesome little character quirks.
ARE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE HEARTS ROMAN HAD AROUND HIS HEAD WHEN HE LOOKED AWAY FROM VIRGIL OMG
IS NICO REAL?!!! WAIT DOES THOMAS HAVE A BF NOW OR IS THIS JUST FOR THE SANDERS SIDES
Omg I literally crying so hard that was fucking beautiful AND YOU PUT A PRINCEY AND VIRGIL SHIP MOMENT IM DYING!!! Ok but I can’t be the only one who was shouting KISS HIM to princey when he was telling Virgil he was brave right? I probably was nvm.....
oh thats the guy form vine
so cute! when virgil gets excited his makeup glows purple.  (also: at one point while virgil was grilling thomas about all the deceit i was fully expecting janus to pop up and say hi and virgil to say 'NOT YOU')
4:25 OK 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏IT COULD BE A BIT GAYER THOUGJ 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was so cuteeee:3
We all miss Logan and Patton, but this freaking slapped
Virgil: * sees Roman sad* Also Virgil: * goes against everything he pretty much stands for* Me: *:D*
Love Virgil's eyeshadow changing in the end
You sander sample is a good name
So when virgil is exited his eyeshadow turns purple and when hes seriouse its black. Intresting
LOVE IT
STORYLINE?!?!? I MEAN IT MAKES SENSE BUT IT’S CONFIRMED
Yeah I had the ADVERTISEMENT FOR THAT PATREON BEFORE THE VIDEO EVEN PLAYED. *A very weird and indirect spoiler? Or just a foreshadowing.*
As soon as virgil pushed Thomas my phone fell
We need a live version. Stat.
My expierience from this video:  1. Atmosphere: -After SvSR Thomas lightend the mood a lot -Its confirmed that Thomas likes Prinxiety its just about like 80% canon -* inhale * VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS CHANGING IF HES IN A GOOD MOOD!!! AND ITS SO FREAKIN AWESOME! -Fanders are satisfied, shippers are satisfied, multishippers are satisfied and everybody is satisfied -Janus simps are even more happier becuse of the new site and referenses throughout the video -At the end Virgil is the calmest we've ever seen  2. Quotes: 2:50 "By the several severed heads of a Hydra, we're really here aren't we?" "Yup" 4:04 "Liar" compilation 4:18 "Oh! What lad is that which doth enrich the Mac on yonder slate?" "Huh?" "* sigh * cutie at 12 o'clock" 4:44 "That's a classic introverted method of talking about yourself without having to do anything too... extreme... *like talking!* " 5:00 "M'kay for a pessimist im pretty optimistic" 5:11 The triple "oh...my...god..." 5:28 "PINS" "-and needles, im on them too" "No you doofus, there are pins and buttons on his backpack" " * *happy clapping* * More clues!" 5:45 "Those jokes are old..." "You would know" 5:58 "That's completely disregarding the purpose of the sticker, button system. You see some buttons, you button it" "Ugh pintroverts... becuse they talk using pins..." 6:28 That whole comentary scene X'D 7:11 "Ok if we're gonna do this you gotta time how long you're looking otherwhise hes gonna think you're looking at hes backpack "How long is too long? "6 seconds" "Done" "You have 5 seconds max" "Wha' im not Max im prince Ro-" "Go!" Roman takes names as seriously as Logan took everything seriously in first few episodes and that so funny. 7:40 "What now?" "The only logical next step... *go home and regret everything* " "How about i just regret asking that question" 7:50 Again names: "No, man!" "Its Roman... with an R" 7:58 "I'm not an expert on a lot of things, but when it comes to anti'social etiquette i'm like a triple expert. An x x expert. "Easy tiger" 8:12 "Gay eyes?" "Gay eyes" 9:01 "No do look at yourself Thomas, 'cause that was a test *and you FAILED* " "You were testing me?!" "Oh no no no i wasn't testing you, i was just panicking... *no, the universe tested you and you chose to be a liar* " 10:08 "I hate to rain on your 'Black Parade' gerard gay but-" "Hmph..." Guess Virgil just simply can't complain about emo songs references. 12:00 "You were being a baby about the buttons and the pins and you're panicking" *Agreement silence "I guess..." 12:28 "Thats like cyber stalking... but real life!" "Soooo.... stalking" *Agreement silence again "Oh, you're right!" 16:00 - 16:48 That scene. Just that scene becuse im too lazy to do timestamps and quotes. 16:57 "Well... there he goes! One more chance at happiness, squandered..." *Virgil sees Thomas and Roman sad *Breathing intensifies 18:07 - 19:00 Heres the wholesome scene ❤ 19:13 "Nothing but a bruised ego..." "Hmph" 19:23 "I tend to waste a lot of opportunities in my life" "Well... lets not waste this one!" "Shut up" "Shut up" "Shut up!" 19:38 - 20:03 Heres sum prinxiety 💕 20:04 End scene 20:10 "Emphasis on the "old"" "StOp! Get out!" 20:18 And now a heal up for Janus simps 22:22 Continuation end scene 22:52 "I just sub tweet about him" "Thats my boy!" "What did you say!" ""Had a good day today hihi" a heart with an arrow in it..." "Huh? *Delete it* " 23:38 "Thomas im gonna need you to shake your hands, you gotta to do something with them, they're just.. hanging there..." Virgil just isn't used to being so calm. 24:02 *Virgil has some deep thinking process *dog barks *"GHAAAH, DEMON!"* 24:08 "Dude, its ok, that happens 30 times a day, please relax-" *"DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX!"*  This comment took me about 2 hours... oh boi im suprised my fingers don't hurt
i dUnnO p l a n T
Oh I love it!!!!!
gay panic in a nutshell  also is no one talking about how virgil's eyeshadow changes color when he's happy?! like baby boy?! baby?!
Your laugh gives me life❤️
The end part is honestly so relatable, like when I get home from my s/o house I just move my whole body, sometimes I even hop around my room
That was cute
I'm shooting forward I'm shooting straight even tho I'm gay
Can we talk about that fact that virgil's eye shadow is purple
Wow that WAS a little close to home :-D Sanders sides comes full circle... I think I actually started watched these through other people's animatics :-)
This video was made for my newly out of the closet and anxious as hell self
This story is so sweet 😢
This is so cute    Edit: I commented this almost a year before I got into Sander's Sides like this was the only video I had watched at this point so I didn't even get it and now I've binged almost the whole series and I ship Prinxiety for sure. Like I didn't even watch the beginning or stay around for the end card last time, now I'm rewinding in case I missed something or to relisten to line deliveries and stuff. I love this series and I'm watching it at the perfect time for me and my mental health I think.
Wait a d*mn minute did Roman and Virgil blush when Roman touched Virgil shoulder?
My am I cry this is so cute
Roman x Virgil Ship?
Thanks for laying down WHY you have a Patreon, instead of just saying "exclusive content only for those rEaL fans out there, thanks for keeping this channel alive, we love each and every one of our Patreon followers", like, bruh, I'm poor! I know they're showing support because they're excited to bypass the things you detailed, but it makes the dirt poor people like me feel like all they care about is the money, in a way. You always come off as chill and supportive of all your viewers, so you're a good noodle, Sanders!
The fact that virgil did something for roman- and the end of the animatic- My princiety heart is a c h i n g
.o. im shook in this episode
As a distressed socially anxious bisexual, I don’t think I’ve ever related to something so much before.
Thomas... 13:00  That's me every single day of my life-
Awwww it turns purple when Virgil is good anxiety.
Ive never seen virgil this happy omg
Tried to join the patrons... But I can't pay with Australian dollars 😭😭😭
The animatic “about to start”  Add plays “ it plays Thomas add” :/  Quinsidence I think NOT
this is very relatable because pins were how I started talking to the person who would eventually be my girlfriend. She had a pencil case out that was covered in them, I should have known she was gay faster.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW i love this<3<3<3<33
I hate 2020. But this, this makes it better.
What are you doing?? Uhh, Idk...plant?
Oml I got the comecial for the patron before the ep •_•
I’m not sure if it was just me but did anyone else get an add for Thomas’s patreon when Roman and Virgil were yelling “lie!”?  No just me? 😅
Omg I absolutely loved this. I'm crying
Purp- PURPLE?? WTF DOES PURPLE MEAN, VIRGIL??? IS MY EMO BABY GROWING UP??
i want the live action!!
I just got a  Sander sides ad when watching this dryvyvtcbyvyyctcudt
I just came up with two theories...  1: Virgil isn't actually a dark side or a light side but rather the border in the middle. His dark side is Anxiety while his light side is Bravery. He's what keeps Thomas' emotions in balance.  2: Thomas is gonna make Prinxiety canon DiD YoU sEe ThOsE hEaRtS????    Edit: Am I the only one who thinks Thomas and a certain British Mincraft youtuber with close to 4 mil subscribers would get along?      Thomas and George I want answers.
My virgil was going crazy throughout this hole video!!
"Enjoy your movie" "You too! Wait..." I felt that. Your grandmother felt that. The universe felt that.
purple eyeshadow!!!
I’m so proud of Virgil!!!!
Guy says he writes songs Me: I'm StAnDiNg On ThE borderline!
Omg I squealed I’m so happy for Thomas 🥺💕
I love the fact that with the animation the sides can physically interact with each other! It's so amazing and adorable!!
flirt with the boi thomas,flirt with him
flirt with the boi thomas,flirt with him
“ I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY BUT-“😂😂😂😂🙏👌
This is so funny and cute, and I'm having so many feels I'm gonna die 🥺
You too you’re both back yay
Dude, gay eyes is my 1 and only strategy and 10/10 can confirm it does not work 😂
This was pretty gay... 10/10
Bathroom guy needs some love
Well this just feels like a personal attack from the blatant reality lol
i like the new inside out movie hope there's more 😁😁
I'm noticing that in the live action scene at the end that Virgil's eye shadow changes between black and purple, I think that might mean something. He seems happy and excited when it's purple and when he's kind down it's black. Curious, Curious
Roman and Virgil ahhhh
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow changed??? 🤔😳😳😳😳😳 Like, it went from purple to black and then again purple and at the end, it was black, like- Doooode😳😳
Virgils eyeshadow changes to purple when he is happy THAT IS SO PRECIOUS
This hit so painfully close to home, but was so beautiful and amazing at the end. Wow! Fantastic everything man! I love it. I hope Mr. Thomas finds love with the guy!!!! <3
I'd say this video is a massive success.
MY SHIP UGH IT HURTS
It's time for the prinxiety shippers to rise **rises**
Did anyone else notice the purple in virgil’s undereye shadow when they got back to the apartment? Is that like his version of blushing?🥺
I got two adds for the patreon, during the video!! Which is honestly kinda funny!!
Anyone gonna talk Virgils eyeshadow is purple when he gets very excited about this and back to normal black when the mood is ruined?
I honestly cannot right now that was so cute I'm tearing up that was adorable!!! Also I scan people's backpack pins and stickers too, but instead of talking to them I scream at them that I like their stickers/pins and then run away lol (shirts/outfits too)
That was so funny and cute
Yesssss it’s been so longs
THIS WAS SO CUTE AAHHHHH-HH
They call me Sanders cause I move real smooth. But you can call me Thomas if you wanna get- *ruff* *ruff* -sudden realization-
Why is it so hard to watch this one      Most likely the second hand embarrassment and the repeatability of this
Gay eyes
Why did you release a story board instead of an animation? You could have at least colored it before release.
Ahhhh omggggg that was adorable no joke that made we tear up it was so cuteeee
19:34 Virgil and Roman:shut up shut up! me:screaming
Hi Thomas Sanders
i will cri for both thomas and nico. i will just bawl my eyes out dont mind me.
This is freaking adorable oh my God I'm gonna cry
And there I was, thinking I couldn't be more in love
JANUS AD JANUS AD JANUS AD
1. Awesome animatic! I want to make animatics myself, but I'm a sucky artist. So I watch other people do them because they're awesome at it! 2. I hope you're as sweet in real life as you are in your videos because your content always makes me smile. 3. Sending many cyber hugs your way because you are such a cool person, Thomas Sanders!
HAPPY STIM  HAPPY STIM  HAPPY STIM
Okay but when Virgil's eyeshadow is purple he's less anxious and when he gets worried it turns back to black
Aaaaaa i fan girled alot its cute owo
Thomas my God are you so handsome 😍😍❤️❤️
I love that when Virgil is overexcited with giddiness his eyeshadow turns purple and shiny,  but when he starts to worry again it goes back to black.
I WAS JUST FEELING CALLED OUT AND NOW I'M CRYING WHQT THE HECK THOMAS ❤
the seCOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT PLEASEJEHJDNDKSNS
This made me want to vomit 'cause I do all these things and it made me feel more anxious
I got an ad for your Patreon while watching this video Best coincidence I've ever seen
5:03 Paramore reference. Fantastic!!!
WAIT ARE VIRGIL AND ROMAN...ARE THEY FINALLY GOING TO BE SHIPPED OFFICIALLY?!?!
This was,,, weirdly wholesome and relatable because damnn that inner cONFLICT
CAN WE TALK ABOUT VIRGE’S EYESHADOW CHANGING COLORS WHEN HE WAS BEING OPTIMISTIC/EXCITED?!? AAAAAAHHHHHH—
"What are you doing" "I dont know - plaNt~"
Question...does Virgils Make Up Change like when he gets excited? I mean I am not the only one that saw that right RIGHT?!?!
I couldn't help but notice Virgil's make-up at the end, there. When Virgil was happy and optimistic, his eyeshadow/bags were purple - but when the ol' "anxiety" kicked in, they returned to his usual smoky black. Very interesting....
When the episode about anxiety gives you anxiety when watching it-
did this actually happen, you poor poor man.
This gives me life
Normal people: aw how sweet, 5hey put aside there differents to help Thomas  Princiety people: OMG HE TOUCH HIS SHOULDER!!!
Third  time watching this
Niko Flores! I think he's pinoy!
My dating advice do what I do    I want u to put your face on my face
This was so cute and I loved it so much
What if they're just European?
Virgil's eye shadow changes with he's mood in that end clip
Ok this is literally on my cute list!!! THIS NEEDS TO BE A BL PLEASE
DUUUUUUUDE I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING AN AWEEESOOOME ANIME LIKE HSJSBVGSIQLANSL THATWASSOOOOCOOOOL
So ur telling me, that when Virgil gets exited/emotional whatever his shaddows get purple? 🥺✨
I wanna subscribe to your patron but I'm already paying for yagami yato's 🥴👋
I FRCKN CRIED T-T
the Disliked are from people who liked it so much they misclicked the like button! this is so awesome, worth the wait!
Mack a tv show
Fellow Fujoshis and Fudanshis unite!
Can we talk about about Virgil’s changing eyeshadow in the end scene?
"shut up" "Shut Up" "SHUT UP!"
This is the first time I've seen this and I can't stop fangirling
This whole episode is just gay panic and i love it
WHY HAVE NONE OF YOU TALKED ABOUT WE CAN LIVE LIKE JACK AND SALLY IF YOU WANT
it would be great if Thomas make a video kind of Accepting Anxiety but this time with Logic.  I mean the film when other realised how is Logan important for Thmas and them.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH but my heart is bleeding when I see how they are ignoring him 0_0
We'll have Halloween at Christmas <3
Good story but whats the point being gay XD A boy and boy f then a hoy is pregnant you will die.
This tugged at my heartstrings!!! I loved it so much. 🥰
me: *sad cuz i don't patreon* not even 5 mins later: *happy to play roblox*
"Huh. delete it" ME AFTER SENDING AN I MISS YOU TO A FRIEND AND THEY DONT REPLY IN THE NEXT FIVE SECONDS
Is no one gonna talk about Virgils purple eyeshadow??
I absolutely loved this episode the art still was great and the story line jus...amazing 😁❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Hello! I know this from Gacha Life and this is my first time watching the Sander Sides Episodes (or something)
Anyone else noticed the millennium puzzle
WHY IS NOONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL BECOMING AN OFICIAL LIGHTSIDE?!?!?!  Just PLEASE look at his eye shadow in th end. A I over thimkimg or is it purple instead of black a couple times? Like, come on, HOW DID YOU ALL NOT NOTICE
That was SO FREAKING CUUUUTTTTEEEEE!!!!!!
Gay eyes? I suppose you can say they were ... Gayzing at eachother.
Oof
from 1:26- 1:32-
Is the shipping of two of sanders 'sides', an alagory of Thomas learning to love himself?
Can we talk about the symbolism in the end card? Virgils eye make up being separated into the purple and white when he was clearly excited about the new boy and black when he was nervous about it?  BB VIRGIL WAS HAPPY. 🥰
T^T my heart is so like- happy- T^T
I WAS COMING BACK TO RE WATCH THIS AND JANUS'S AD CAME UP
my heart cant take this, this is so cute omg
BRUH, this video is like 20 minutes and it damn near took me an hour to get through it because I was going through gay panic the whole fucking time. It was fun to listen to while I was drawing though lol. cant wait till the next one.
"Ugh, you're killing me Virgil" Logan watching all if this happen: "VIRGIL WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT"
This video is hella gay
Why can I imagine this: Plankton from SpongeBob:"HES EMO?!" Sponge bob:"yes plankton.its pretty obvious..." Virgil   *contemplating life choises* Thomas and Roman :    *confusion*
CHARACTER THOMAS FINALLY GOT A MAN
The fact that this straight up happened to me the other day makes this way too relatable XD
Did y’all see Virgils eyeshadow change too?!
Ever since last ep was so weird and serious I was worried for this one lol
HES GOT STICKERS ON HIS LAPTOP
Omg finnaly!!!
The i love you anxiety made me have to take a break with my boyfriend because i was terrified to say it back without "knowing if i really meant it". This video made me cry, it really hit way too close to home for me.
What everyone else sees: *thomas walking in random directions and talking to himself* -I mean hey I do it so-
YESSSSSSS I HAVENT WATCHED YOUR CHANNEL IN SO LONG AND IM NOT DISAPPOINTED BY MY RETURN VIDEO 😍😍😍
This was so cute, I really hope he makes more like this.
DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE HOW WHEN VIRGIL WAS WAS HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW TURNED PURPLE??? 23:11 22:54 23:48 And you KNOW it only happens when he’s happy because when Thomas says “ are we ready ” because Virgils eyeshadow goes right back to black and gets super dark  24:03
Did anyone else think this was to be a video of Roman and the gang trying to make Virgil blush? Or am I just that desperate to ship them 👉👈  Either way I loved this lil bit and I happy to see more! 💞✨
Totally gay man so damm gay
Virgil learning bravery is absolutely one of the cutest things I've seen in a while.
The fact that Virgil pushed Thomas to him just for Roman makes me think prinxiety is canon.
My heart hurts
"No man!" "It's Roman! With an R!"
so cute love it <3 you always make me laugh :)
I GOT A THOMAS SANDERS AD BEFORE THE VIDEO EVEN STARTED XD
"ahhh demon"
Anyone notice how in the end (In the live action part)when Anxiety first comes in all happy his eye shadow is lsparkily ight purple and then when his mood drops its back to black?! like THE DETAIL its SO CUTE!!!!!!!! AHHHH
That goddamn plant, glad I'm not the only one who's done that 😂
Yeah for me it goes *starts scene*  My trans boy self walking down the mall:  Cute boy sitting and looking at me:  Me not sure if I pass or if he is gay or not:  Me: *looks down fittles with fingers*  Anxiety side: no don't you dare  Me: *looks at friend then looks back at him*  Gay side: well just maybe try talking to him  Me: *rubs back of neck from gay panic*   Anxiety: if you mess this up I swear to god  Me: "soo how you doing today"  My anxiety side: NOOO YOU DUMBASS PLEASE SHUT UP  My gay side: you ruined it he is so straight  My trans side: you look like a girl he thinks your a girl sh*t  Cute boy: "I’m doing good how about you"   My trans self: tell him your a boy   My gay self: he’s so adorable omg ahhh  My anxiety: don’t you dare I swear to go...  Me: "umm I’m doing good now" *whispers sh*t under breathe*   Anxiety: *smacks face in embarrassment* I tried  Cute boy: I- *visibly confused*   Cute boy: *laughs and rubs the back of his neck*  Anxiety: look at what you have done  Me: "I'm so sorry I don't know where that came  from”  Him: "oh no problem so how old are you”  Me: oh I'm 18 *thinks take that anxiety*  Him: "that's cool I'm 18 too"  Me: "so what you doing at the mall at hot topic"   Him: "nothing much getting some pins"  Me: "that’s cool so what pins you getting" *fidgeting with my pride pan pin, rainbow pin and trans pin*  Him: "just the bi pin”  Me: "oh so your bi I'm part of the lgbt too I'm ftm, and pan mostly gay tho"  Him: "yeah me and my gf are both bi we are getting the same pin”  Anxiety: told you so  Gay side: plot twist oof that must have hurt  Me: *heart cracks* "oh that's cool I am just shopping with my friend we are just looking around you know" *puppy failed eyes, my friend, to help*   My friend: ”hey Keyl got what you like cause Im ready and we have to go soon"  Me: "oh ok well nice meeting you" *checks out with my friend and leaves to grab some vegan food and silently cries while stuffing themselves with skittles and other vegan junk food while mumbling and talking to my friend trying to cheer them up*  End scene: The story of my life lol
Thomas: *does a whole confession*  Nico: Oh mY GoD        You should have just said hi!  Me: *dies of cuteness overload*
THIS MADE MY GAY HEART SO HAPPY.
Dude this is me with any girls I have crushes on
That was so cute!!! Like I can't!!!! I actually was hoping up and down it was so cute!!! (Ngl tho the second hand embarrassment was real lol!) I absolutely hope you do this in Live action but the animatic style was amazing!!!!!! I' so glad I watched this when I did cause rn it's late at night and I'm trying to finish up painting this jacket I've been working on (It's day four of no sleep ;-;) and watching this has given me a second wind thank you for giving me a video to fangirl over!!!! IT WAS SO CUTE!
give me more, please
Me: *heart bursts with happieness for Thomas* Me: ^-^ i love being single and alone
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay," ICONIC
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW OMG!!!! That is absolutely the most adorable thing in the world
"Punk. Lil punk" is my fave line.
THAT WAS SO CUTE OMGGG
My heart!! That was so cute
I liked it because it showed how creativity branches you out but anxiety will close you up but the anxiety of not knowing what will happen is just as bad as thinking of what will happen
The little pink I love that
Thomas: I'm just overthinking things Roman: YEAH! Join me, no thinking.
Maybe I do ship prinxiety
That’s realllly cuteee
I don’t ever flirt I just act myself (dumb,weird,annoying) and somehow people have crush’s on me sometimes and I wonder how and I worry for them 😂
OMG YOU'RE THAT GUY WHO WAS ON VINE WHO WAS REALLY ANNOYING BUT IT WAS FUNNY!!! I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU!!!
Anyone notice that Virgil was trying to get Thomas or the room
Me with every girl  to me
Can we talk about how the eyeshadow alternated? Like, i absolutely loved the purple, but they used it to show Virgil was happy and excited (or at least i think they did) and i feel like that made it all even better
*i can smell the shippers*
This was the cutest thing I’ve seen all day and I live around 12 cats 😅
My happy stims rlly said 🌆🖐🤙🖐✨🙌👋👏☝👆💪🖖✊🖐✊👈✋
Virgil: Will decite be the continue to answer all you problems Is that fair for him  Virgil does care about decite
THOMAS I SWEAR TO THE SPAHGETTI MONSTER IN THE SKY PLEASE LET THIS STORY BE TRUE!! I WANT YOU TO HAVE A POETIC, COOL, AND FLIRTY BOYFRIEND!!! PLEEAASSEEEEE!!!!!! PLEASE LET THIS STORY BE SOMEWHAT TRUE IN THE FACT THAT YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND!!!!!!!!
I WOULD LOVE MORE. PLEASSSSEEE
The prinxiety moments.... I'm SCREAMING
☺this was warm
I literally cried after watching that. I wish that things could be like that in the real world. I am such a crybaby
That moment when this is giving me second hand embarrassment
I felt so much secondhand embarrassment-
ALERT WE HAVE SHIPPING, SHIPPING EVERYWHERE, HEARTS CAN NOT CONTAIN THIS KIND OF ROMANCE, RUN WHILE YOU CAN
This is unbearably cute
How did I NOT SEE THIS
I wish I had money and was older so I could to the partion and there is like 2 thing I want from it. The writing of a script and the annual call.   Tomas knows that his fans ship anxiety and creativity, so his making it happen.🙂 or hopefully he’s realized it
OMG OMG OMG OMG! I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING!
gUYS- WHY ARE WE N O T TALKING ABOUT VIRGLS PURPLE EYESHADOW IN THE END CARD????
thomas, ya probably wouldn't put salt in cakes-
THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THOMAS
anyone wondering who would play nico in real life? just sayin man. love the vid btw-
No in gods holy name no! Virgil and Roman can not get together just no
Omg I’m pretty sure I dyed of happiness not gonna lie ❤️ 😊
OMG!!!! THIS WAS SO CUTE AND GREAT. I LOVED IT!!!!
i haven’t watched Thomas in liek a year-
This is sooooo good ☺ my gay heart is happy
You rush to assign malice (lies!)  to the ambiguity and uncertainty of discovery a lot. Please be kinder to yourself during exploration.
For I thought John Milkovich was  mr clean
OMG this gave me the feelys and I started panicking!!  (づΩ▄Ω)づ
OH NO, NEXT EPISODE GONNA HIT SUPER HARD AND I CANT WAIT  the look in Virgils Eyes has me both concerned and excited for the next episode... I've been struggling to find out if i was truly ready for a relationship and i think the advice in the next episode (or at least the episode that goes over this concept/topic) is really gonna put things in perspective for me! Thank you always for the Amazing Content Thomas!
When the Thomas Sanders cartoon being storyboarded for a Thomas Sanders live action sketch is interrupted by a Thomas Sanders ad for the Thomas sanders Patreon.
This makes me want to go outside and meet someone new!!.. only if we could ever go outside again.
am I the only person that realized the "Makeup" under Virgil's eyes turned purple when he was existed and happy but is black when he's being well Virgil and being anxiety.
This was SO CUTE! I might have started crying, but shhh you don't need to know that,,,
Virgils reflection
I know a lot of people say the best part of this is mainly the funny moments, but I honestly think it was the scene after they get out of the bathroom. Talking about starting the relationship with truth, was both incredibly sweet and painfully real. As someone who has trouble talking to people, especially when feelings are involved, I can relate and also take a good life lesson from this.
My mind went blank after this-
This is exactly how i feel everytime seeing a i like or whtvr guy...
Was it normal to cry at the end because it reminds me of me? Gosh I'm a mess, anyways I absolutely loved this episode! It was nice and the animators did an amazing job.
Roman: "thomas your gonna have to try speaking from your heart!”   *add pops up*   Me: is this what he mean by speaking from the heart? Adds?
Oh
MY HEART THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE THING WAS LIEKE AAAABSHSJAHDHKSGAAJDG
Could be Gayer?
I teared up at the end, this really hit home for me. Showed exactly how I feel whenever I see a cute girl but dont know if shes bi or lesbian. I loved this all great work. ❤
im a child i cant get patron
DOES ANYONE ELSE VIRGIL’S EYES AT THE END??? LITERALLY NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE PURPLE EYES！！！
*do you know what I love you means to them Thomas?* no- *exactly*
Wait.    They guy is named "Nico"     *Wasnt the guy in the song "Gay Or Euoropian" also named Nico?*
Virgil's eyeshadow changing to match his gay levels tho-
2:26 When the beauty Starts uwu
AWWWWWWWWWWW
John 14:15 You can find hope and rest in Jesus
Nobody:   Thomas: *GAY PANIC*
That was so beautiful and cute
13:48 - Wait what?! both Roman and Virgil and their reflections looked at Thomas???
I AM FEELING SO CALLED OUT RIGHT NOW. I SAW A CUTE GUY IN HOT TOPIC THE OTHER DAY. BUMPED INTO HIM A FEW TIMES AND SAID NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
Great video, but could we see your gay eyes in live action next time? I bet they're really something!
Gay eyes me oooohhh he gonna us the gayze
WAIT he was at the mall and he didn't Manchin hot topic!!!!!
Do you think someone's sides can talk to somebody else's sides
22:23 the gay panic is strong with this one
So beautiful 🥺
“You can call me Nico” *NICO* even better
👏👏👏👏😂
I feel so attacked rn I love it🤣
This is beautiful oh my goodness
You have inspired me so much! I waist opportunitys like that all the time... So thank you :-)
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE "shut up emo" WITH HEART'S- EXCUSE ME OMGMGMMGMGGM MY SHIPPP 😭😭😭😭
we all knew he was gay.
This was so fun! I'm curious as to what was up with the self sabotage here though? Virgil keeps telling Thomas to do things, sometimes even shoving him in different directions, but then calls Thomas a liar for doing those things. Are Anxiety and Deceit more linked than Virgil would like to admit, and Virgil hates himself for that but blames Thomas? It's a little confusing.
Bro this mafe me cry😭itss soo gooodddd i lived ittt
I couldn't stop laughing and squealing during this. it's so corny and cute.
I'm about 4 minutes in and all I have to say is why is this me-
the 575 dislikes are homophobes. I on the other hand LOVE it.
*I got a sander sides ad, perfect.*
This is the most perfect way of how to describe me when I'm trying to flirt
🥺🥺🥺✨ that was sooo CUTE
This is the cutest animatic I’ve ever seen! This is so amazing! I love this so much! 💕✨  aaaaaaaaaahhhh!!! 😭💕✨
"We don't know if he's not gay" Me anytime I see a hot girl at a restaurant or something
Y'all doing awesome!!
I wasn't really looking forward to this episode at the start because animation takes away from all of the intricacies of the face, but wow this was funny!!
That was sweet :>
19:40 I SWEAR SHIP!!!!!!!!!!
Am I the only one who thought Nico could see the sides?...
Thomas has me thinking about my laptop stickers now 👁👄👁
YASSSSSSSS THOMAS FOUND TRUE LIFE!!!! NOT TO MENTION PRINXIETY!!!! IMMA DIE! YASSSSSS❤️❤️❤️ ILY SO MUCH THOMAS! ❤️ Honestly, meeting you would be such a blessing and watching your videos is a HONOR! ILY SO MUCH!
Even though that was animated that was so sweet and so true about me having social anxiety but I never do it
So u have a bf now.
Virgil, you did it... you're emoting.  God, I miss Brooklynn 99
That was so cute!!
So glad I’m not straight
He should react to the owl house
xdddd help
PRINCXIETYYYYYY
That was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
I just love how when they were in the restroom Virgil was once again sitting on a surface that isn’t meant to be sat on. Typical Virgil 😄
PRINXIETY!!!!!!
I love being a "non-binary pal." :D
This was absolutely amazing! I love that you and others where able to make such an amazing thing as this! The script was absolutely incredible and heart warming, and the animation clean and well done!
Thomas: Nothing but a bruised ego Me: * has flashbacks* Thomas: I think my ego is a little brusied Roman: MY EVERYTHING HURTS!!!
My bad day has turned around... glad they figured out a way to give us Sanders sides in quarantine :) stay safe everyone!
You came bace
I like how Virgil's happiness is expressed with glittery purple eyeliner
Why ya gotta make me wanna join your patrion so badly!! 😫 But alas, I am a smol freshman with a farm job with which I sadly cannot pay for a patrion rn. Love you tho Thomas ❤️❤️💜💙🤍💚💛 (those are the sides colors... you probably knew that 😅 i’m gonna stop talking now)
I loved everything about this
Ouch, this hit too close to home..
I NEED TO KNOW THAT NICO GUY IS!!!
“I hate to rain of your black parade Gerard Gay” this lines too good
Prinxiety anybody???
I got an ad deciet- **concern**
That was soooooo cute
How do you know if you gay, I want to know cause I can’t tell if I am or not. I think I am, but I think I’m not. I’ve haven’t fallen in love yet soooo I don’t know yet UGH
These videos never fail to make me happy
What, I’m not crying, what are you talking about
Me: *Laughs in aromanticism* Me: *Cries in anxiety*
Awe, the way that Virgil's eye shadow was brighter when he was happy is so cool! Every detail is so well thought out! Great job to the animators, too!
I wonder what all my like 100s of comments look like under all these videos like is the comment section just my icon and me being a simp over and over and over and over
I'M SOBBING
Virgil actually listening to Roman’s crazy ideas when he’s excited is so perfect and I love it
I loved it thomas!
I love Roman so much
I’m already a Nico simp this isn’t good help
Tell me why Niko was describing my life
Gerard gay. I’m using that
The way roman said “what the hell was that?” Killed me XD
i love this . the ending was so cute :)
This one was soooo good!!
GERARD GAY I C A N' T
This is why people ship prinxiety
“pLANt”  I’m gonna hide behind plants more
THE ROMAN AND VIRGIL SHIPPERS ARE FINNA GO INSANE
Lmao “shut up emo”😂❤️
Is this a true story?
that was so cute. 🥺🏳️‍🌈
Question are we gonna ignore the fact that emo and flirty where blushing at each other the whole time ..? Or where those just how they were drawed
that animatic was the cutest thing ive ever seen and I relate so hard
I love this video and I have a new ship! Thomas and Nico are adorable! also prinxiety!
AHHHHHHHHHHHH HE IS BACK
the ending was so cute i caannttt
A sander sides ad on the video
I GOT A TOMAS SANDERS ADD BEFORE WATCHING AN TOMAS SANDERS VIDEO
Wait what hes gay
This was the dorkiest cutest thing
This was so cute..- 🥺🏳️‍🌈
I got an add for Thomas’ patron and I didn’t get it last time I saw the video was what?
Thomas. You can’t make stuff like this and expect Prinxiety NOT to happen
While watching this video I got an ad for your patreon-
Thomas I think we need a 'The dark side of Disney' part 2. Would really love to see it.
Pintreverts is my new favourite word Also,this was so relatable it hurt
Why am I crying
THIS GAY MAN GOT THIS GAY GIRL LOWKEY BLUSHIN.
16:05  Thomas: ....     🎵 GAY PANIC🎵
Did you guys notice at the end of the video Virgil Dark circles change to black purple and green
Bro, why am I fanpersoning over Thomas and Niko- There adorable and I don't care what people say
I never thought you were gay now that I think it was kinda obvious
Roman is basically Thomas' sociality (have no idea if that's a word)...  Virgil is Anxiety...     *Realization*       *OH MY GOD THATS SOCIAL ANXIETY-*
Roman: "You're going to have speak drom the heart"  *gets a sprite way ad but reads it as sprint away *  Me: I don't like running but sure
✨Virgil with purple eyeshadow when he's happy✨ Gives✨me✨life✨
I'm crying! That was so cute!
Was- Was there a reference to Creep in this?
So pure 🥰😊!!!!!
OMG In the last part, when they're all giggling, Virgils eyeliner was PURPLE instead of black. You can see it change multiple times  !!  HFAOUD:IJK?NJOFHLJA ILOVE ALL OF THEM SO MUCH
THIS WAS AMAZING I LOVED IT OMGIJDKSLCDNLVNFINWJS LIVE ACTION LIVE ACTION WOULD BE AMAZING THIS WAS AMAZING I  I love this.
I love your channel I really want to meet you in real life
Also this works for anyone
So outside of the shop lifting part, where's the real danger?
Did anyone else get a Thomas Sanders Patereon ad before the video
Did anyone else notice Virgil's makeup!? The eye shadow was purple when he was happy or exited then changed back to black when he grew nervous! Also this was amazing!! I loved it so much!!😁🙃
19:31 prinxiety is that you?
I'm straight but is relatable for talking to people I'm awkward because I am quiet for most of the time and I need time to talk to people
well thAT TOOK A TWIST-
“Ugh. Pintroverts” THAT WAS SUCH A CUTE LINE
MEH HEART
Did anyone else notice that Virgil's eye makeup changed? After Thomas asked if he's ready for a relationship, Virgil's makeup went from purple with highlighter to black
GERARD GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Princixty😍
Thomas stop making me CRY  Okay but please don’t this was adorable
*Prinxity confirmed ?*
PRINXIETYYYYYYYY!!!?!??!??!?!??!?!??!?!?!!!!! ALSO DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW WAS ALL COLOURFUL AND GLOWY!!!!!!!!!
Anyone gonna talk about the end of the video where they all come home? So cute, Virgil’s eyeshadow was looking so good there, and what’s with that look that Virgil gave? Seriously, is no one gonna talk about this?!?!
I feel second hand embarrassment, anyone else?
The Sides in public give off a super strong Fairly Odd Parents vibe.
Oh my it’s been YEARS since I last watched Thomas/this series and it’s still so good! I’m glad Thomas is still doing well
this makes me so happy
NO NEED TO CALL ME OUT WITH THE STICKERS THERE BUD.
Why does YouTube show me this AFTER 4 DAYS!!!
there was an ad before this video of deceit advertising something. now how tf did youtube know to only show me that ad before THIS video. i've never seen that ad before.. 💀
i LOVE how at the end virgils eyeshadow changes with his mood oohhhh!!!! <3
POSITIVE VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOWWWWW
Yo, this reminded me of how I talk to my inner self.  I should go hang the hoodies, but then I should clean the bed, but if I clean the bed then the floor needs to be clean first so I have space to put stuff away. Oh I should put on music.  *Finishes cleaning*  Ahh, I'm so tired now   I'm rereading this before I comment it, and I sound really indecisive, I probably am, but most of the time I'm not. I just get all weird when I'm by myself.
❤️
I need tissues now😭🤧
UM, WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE NEW MAKEUP LOOK FOR VIRGIL?!?! ITS SO CUTE
Omg this animation was BEAUTIFUL! I cried at the end cause it was so amazing😂💕
I'm always going up to people and reading their buttons lol personal space what's that?
noone: not even a soul: not even jacksepticeye:    thomas:TOP ON THE MORNIN TO YA BUDDY!
MAKE VIRGIL’S HODDIE FOR MERCH like if you agree 👇🏻
“Shut up emo <3”
The guy in the stall 😂
No one: Me at the end of the video:holy God there was a PRINCXITY MOMENT
WAIT. VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY/EXCITED. OH MY GOD!
Why does Virgil’s eyeshadow make him look like Dabi from MHA?
This is precious
PLEASE do a LIVE -ACTION version of this (when it's safe) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was a gay mood
I honestly love this! Hoping to see more animated stuff!!
I just realized Roman said the same thing those other workers at the mall said
Amazing
SO YOU GUYS just had to cure my anxiety for my work THANK YOU SO MUCH
YAY he's back
Me: *Anxiety and creativity are the core parts of my personality-* Frend: LOOK AT THIS- *but we don't have enough time to go through the adverti-* Me: *F%CK IT WE WATCH AT DAWN, BOI-*
i hate how relatable this is. giving me ptsd of trying to approach people
Am I the only one hoping that this is how Thomas met a secret boyfriend cause I want that for him
This is perfect I love it
Basicly you're the improved gay version of me
Yay! New episode and I hope ur doing okay 👌🏻
*Prinxiety shippers are summoned*
💡 what if sander sides takes place in an alternate universe where people can summon physical representations of core personality traits
I almost cried during the scene in the bathroom- it was so beautiful! The whole thing was so cute and I loved it.
"I dont know what that was" Gay panic "Bravery" Nah, gay panic
That was    ADORABLE
6:28 virgils little nod i cant-
ive never shipped the sides but this episode... hm
Me clicking this for the 50th time: Janus add plays   Me : 😳🤯🥳
"We can live like Jack and Sally if we want"   Haha  Blink-182, Virgil's emo-  I get it  Ha.  Ahahaha  (but seriously I fully broke out into song after 5:19)
I duNo pLaNT
Yes
I just realized this format makes it so that the sides can touch each other which would never be possible with the normal form unless they got someone who was a god with greenscreen
That was so adorable
happy virgil with sparkly purple eyeshadow gave me sooooo much serotonin ✨✨✨
Does this mean thomas has a boyfriend-or crushhhh-
Ohhh hoho princxiety gonna go crazy
Aight it's official this is the cutest one yet
Hopefully you can do daily vlogging 💕
Why is this me!!

That Virgil x Roman at the end
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME I'M GOING TO CRY
19:56 everyone just ignoring the hearts? Im losing my m a r b l e s i love it so much
10:08 I LOVE THAT
I’ve had this happen to me so many times and I’ve honestly met some of the best people ever and it was so worth it.
I GOT A ADD FROM DECIET/Janeces right now at the end
could you search up gacha sanders sides because yes UwU
OOH VIRGIL’S HAPPY MAKEUP- HIS EYESHADOW CHANGES BASED ON HIS MOOD! THATS SO CLEVERRR
Ok that animation was adorable and all too relatable xx
I like to fight my social anxiety by immediately going and talking to a person that seems cool and then as soon as the encounter is over I die internally of embarrassment but 80% of the time I make a new friend
This is amazing omg my heart
With thomas lying so much in this video, im surprised deciet wasnt in this vid
19:40 istg my heart exploded
Gay~~~~
Don’t mind this, just timestamps  5:39 6:23 6:54 7:38 8:46 10:48
he aged so much
AHHHHHH THAT WAS SO CUTE AND RELATABLE AND JUST AHHHHH
rich brian
I for real got an ad for Thomas sanders while watching Thomas sanders  It’s beautiful-
Oh this episode made my cry and it made me soo happy eehh!
AWWW MY HEART!!! THIS IS SO ADORABLE!!!!!
Did he actually meet someone?!!?
HOLY I GOT AN AD ABOUT JANUS’S THING Anyway back to what I was gonna say, a dragon is a lizard with wings right? But before they were feathered serpents of just big snakes, therefor Janus could be the dragon witch
I LOVE the details with Virgil's eyeshadow! Keep up the good work!💐
Ahh that So cute <3!!!!
"Flirting with social anxiety"  Me: WAIT WAIT IS ROMAN(or any other side) GONNA HUG/DO SOMETHING NICE TO VIRGIL?
I love it so much 💖 beautiful
22:50 that smile Virgil you are my sweet emo baby and I love you 🖤
oh my god that was so CUTE
Top of the morning jelatties
Everyone: watches Thomas  Me: admires castle in back
I love this!! It's the sweetest thing! <3
Virgil: * looking like it's time to confess something* *dog barks* ahhhh demon.
I ship Virgil and Roman do i need to clear that Shippp
19:42-20:00 is prinxiety at its best!!
I hewrd gay eyes, but when insaw them i SOMEHOW  *K N E W*
Not even gonna lie right before the animatic started I got an ad for the exact patrion you were talking about lol
Does he have DID?
Oh my god, how cute!
What if Virgil's eyeshadow change colors to purple when he's really happy or excited my heart
Wait- thank you so much for including non-binary pals  I am enby and people always say I don’t exist....TYSM
19:05 this here gives me such a shera vibe!
HELLY YES -
No, no, I wasn't testing you; I was panicking.
19:38 - 20:03   AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH PRINXIETY 🥺🥺🥺
does this mean that the roman and virgil ship is real?
.Stickers are how intorvets talk about themselves without talking, I didn't relise how true that was until now lol. Also I loved this! Almost cried and I laughed a lot. This really helped.
I'm crying
This episode is the ship at its finest.
I just experienced a loss today, but this literally just made my day! i love the animatic style. it was so fluid and amazing! this is literally exactly how I would probably act around my crush if I saw them irl again. wishing you well during this crisis! ✨
I SQUEALED WAY TOO MUCH
It's like this whole mess, where you avoid talking to him, is more awkward, than if you just had started talking to him in the first place.
i got an ad with deciet in it before this started.
THIS REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF STEVEN UNIVERSE I'M DYING!!!!
I smell a side ship 😏(if you don’t know what I’m talking about emo and princy😏)
why am I never ready
I don't mean to be rude, i'm really just wondering, but does Thomas have DID?
I am literally tearing up rn, this is the sweetest thing everrrrrrr ❤️
I never shipped a real person except today 🥺🥺🥺🥺😳😳😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love the animatic.
you know this hits close to home whenever you have to pause the video on multiple occasions to mentally recover because you feel anxiety for all of thomas’ situations
AHHHH is us in happiness as- OMG SANDER SIDES IS     B A CK-
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  ROOOMMMMAAAAANNNNNNNN MY HEARTTT!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
“Just rela—  “DONT TELL ME TO RELAX”
Prinxety should shut up and kiss already
The ads were your patreon 🙃
I'm so glad I decided to watch this while I was alone because I was shouting and squealing and dancing.  Art? Amazing! Story? Wonderful! My heartstrings? Pulled (but in a good way, calm down Virgil) I like seeing people I enjoy happy so this was really nice, and I always enjoy seeing everyone in the Sanders Sides Stories. Daily dose of serotonin right here. 😊
The amount of times I just started to scream during this-
Oh gosh I can feel the panic from this video and this is so accurate to what I do sometimes qwq
I know this is animated, but I am cringing. SO HARD!!!
I think I’m going to cry. Just got an LGBTQ+ ad, 2 ads about joining Thomas’s patrons, and 2 ads with only black and Latino actors😌
THAT´S THE BEST MOVIE I´VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
hay 😬😥
Its a sanimatic
Thomas: P L A Y    AL O N G me: *_NOOOOO_*
THe pUrple EYeshaDOW!! also RUDE! IM POOR YET WANT THAT SHIRT!!!
yayyy :) now I can’t wait until the next sanders sides comes out in 2026 :)💞
Tell me how I was just watching this and I saw a sanders asides  Ad?
I really really REALLY want to know if this actually happened and if you're gonna get a boyfriend soon
Anyone else see the title and think "Oh god is Roman gonna make moves on Virgil, is that narcissism or incest"?
No body:  Bathroom scene:  Virgil likes to sit on a place that isn't meant to be sat on
I got 6 adds waching this and i was sad
Dude they act like little schoolgirls at the end lmfao
HELP IM GAY
OMG I am going to cry THe "shut up emo" was too cute uehduehdued AND VIRGIL'S HAPPY PRETTY PURPLE SPARKLY EYESHADOW DNEIUDNEUDKDEHD
THEY. ARE. SO. CUTE. OH. MY. GOD.
This was so adorable!! 🥰
I’m pretty sure my voice just reached a new pitch of squeaking
“You shoulda just said hi!” Hits so hard every time 😭😭😭
I just love how Roman is acting like a fanboy I really funny and cute as the same time !
“He fears things too?!” Is so brilliant I’m obsessed
Roman is so cool danggit I cANT
This is so fun!!! I love this!!! Its like the video game theme last vid but better!
I’m back watching this again and THEYRE SO CUTE OMG
I would love to support you on patreon. But unfortunately I just lost my job, so I don’t have any money to support you. I absolutely love this video! It was fantastic!
I like how virgil and Roman are the pair to deal with romance it makes perfect since and gives us more of the Virgil Roman content is shippers love.💕💕💕
PRINXIEY HAS BEEN SHIPPED
THIS IS TOO CUTE IM CRYING
SO CUTE OMAGASH AAAAAA
EXCUSE ME ARE YOU CONFIRMING PRISIETY BECAUSE OMG I SAW HEARTS NEAR ROMAN
I'm crying....
I haven’t related to something on such a monumental level      Until now
Where is the FloMas fan content we all need? And is this based off of a real experience? And how is this going to be "really important to the story"? SO MANY QUESTIONS
Virgil and Roman remind me of Sebastian and Elliot from Stardew Valley so much.
Gerard gay. Amazing
Someone’s probably already said this and honestly idk but like hear me out WHAT IF ANXIETY IS BECOMING BRAVERY AND WHEN HIS EYE SHADOWS COLOR CHANGES THATS HIM EXHIBITING SIGNS ?!?!?!?!?!?!
You know you made it when your own patreon add plays before your own video 😂
The amount of music quotes in this is amazing! ^^
I died when virgil kept shoving you and started crying when you fell over and hid in the trashcan 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thomas: Get all this amazing stuff that you definitely want because I know you really want it with Patreon. My broke ass: I'm in paaaaaaaaaain pain
No man  It’s Roman with an R
Roman: Shut up emo... My heart: ASJASHJSAHASJSHaHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Nice 👍👍
I cried when roman said shut up emo it was so cute and sweet anyone else? 😂😭😁
Sooooo cute
Man I loved this. I was smiling ear to ear
I want a book , a whole as book, can't be long enough. Or a musical , ohhh a book and a musical!
Whenever I'm sad imma remember Virgil in this video and imma be immediately happy, like, its not a joke, this makes me so happy u have no idea.
The amount of musical quotes. I don't know if they are intended or I am just imaginan them. XD both could be possible
Am I the only one who noticed the Disney LEGO castle in the back?
okaaaaaaay, u need to have more animated episodes. I LOVE THIS TOO MUCH ;_____;
This is the Gay or European musical Thomas edition
So like- I was watching with no sound because I’m in study hall and I don’t have headphones with me today- but from the beginning part after he gets the movie ticket it looks a lot like someone taking their gay son and his boyfriend to a movie date 👀 ima watch this after school with the volume actually on so don’t get mad at mE
Ooooooo lots of ships
Thomas, I will be pledging as soon as I possibly can. Your videos have helped me so much with coming to terms with certain things in my life. All the sides remind me of my alters in some way and it always helps when I watch your videos because it feels like there's someone out there that can actually help me cope with the loud headspace I have. You're amazing, please keep up the great work!!! 🥺🧡🧡🧡🧡
Question: what is Gay eyes?  I'm pan-romantic (i think that is the right word) and even i have no idea what "Gay eyes" are, yet I'm highly curious.
Thank GOD a new episode
2020 is _LOOKIN UP_
I relate so much I had to stop every few minutes cos like too awkward too scary.    But that was so cute 🥺💕💕
My came over to my house to give a suprise  Me*watching the video* My friend:*kick my bedroom door*  Me:*suprise and say the bad words* My friend saying that i'm to inoccent to say that
MY HEART THAT'S SO CUTE PLEASE TELL ME THOMAS GETS A BF I WOULD LOVE FOR TO THOMAS TO GET AFFECTION-
this has made my day so much I've been feeling down bc I've broke my arm
I love to see a happy Virgil. His eyeshadow turns purple with highlighter. I love love love it.
Petition to give random bathroom person a hug. Poor thing must've been so embarrassed on top of the let-down of the misunderstanding.
PRINXIETY IS COMING TO LIFE
OH MY GOSH, I WANTED TO SCREAM AT HOW CUTE AND AMAZING THIS WAS BUT EVERYONE'S SLEEPING, (m'alsosupposedtobesleepingbutshhhthatdon'tmatterrightnow) THE ART IS AMAZING AND THE VIDEO IS AMAZING AND GOSH, IM JUST SO HAPPY AND ENERGIZED RIGHT NOW!!  WOW!  i needed something happy and watching your videos always helps, and this really helped after the horrible panic i had last night. Thank you for somehow managing to ground me when i panic bc your content does wonders for me no matter what's going on. Hope ya'll are doing good and even tho i loved seeing an animatic video i do hope you can make irl videos safely again soon.  sorry for the word dumping but i've never been good at getting things across in a non clumpy jumbled way, and i hope to one day purchase some of your merch as well
I- . . . . . .      WAIT IS PRINXIETY CANON!??!?! 😲😲😲🤩🤩🤩
This story stole all my UwUs i'm so soft and i'll prolly won't come out to my crush anyway but thank you so much for this fluff ball 💙
Maybe the flip side of anxiety is excitement- I mean the two emotions are pretty similar- Virgil could encompass both a bit
I littraly screamed I'ma hopeless gay like omph I love romance it's just so delicious MM ahhhhhh
Virgil's smile at 22:50 is the downright cutest thing, I have such a soft spot for this character 🥺💜
I felt Second-hand Social anxiety XD I related to this so well I was also panicking  Also, WHEN THE GUY APPROACHED HIM, I STARTED FLIPPING OUT!!!!!!!!!
19:29 shut UP, that is the moment when all the love angst steamed out
the end card.. just the entire episode, i just love seeing this side of Virgle . and the entire thing is just amazing. i love it so much
Jeez, this hit way too close to home😂
How do u speak from the heart when ur heartless
I’ve never watched a video that I’ve related to on a level that I don’t completely like until now😅
confirmed! Thomas is gay! and Roman x Virgil!
AHHHH THIS WAS SO FUCKING CUTEEE
I got secondhand anxiety from this. Boy I can’t flirt at all.
Thomas, let me introduce you to a thing called second hand embarrassment! It's the reason I can't watch this video
10:44  "What are you doing!?" "I dunno p l a n t"
Omg can we have more of these please thus is so adorable omg I love it so much
Non-princy x virgl shippers at last bit of the animatic: aw they're best friends princey x Virgil shippers at the end of the animatic: oh the tension the romantic tension
HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS UPLOAD
Catch me out here screaming not just about Pintroverts/Karrot Kings/Flanders/every other iteration of Thomas/Nico, but also this episode reflecting the process of Janus being accepted as a valid side??? I may or may not be crying in the club rn  Like-- it reminds me of SvS pt.1 when Janus is talking about "taking off the blindfold" in order for Thomas to get the stuff he wants out of life. That speech has always been a double-edged sword for him as a character. On a superficial level, it can seem like he's advocating for obfuscating the truth in the short-term (the "Aunt Patty in the hospital excuse") to make it to the callback, ("Do you want the part or not?") but in my opinion, Janus has always cared less about what the truth was, and more about Thomas being honest with himself about what that truth is (i.e., who he is and what he wants out of his life). Virgil may not call Janus by his true name at 15:40, he still cares about Janus' well-being more than he has in past episodes ("Your face ruined my day," SvS part 1) asking if putting this pressure on Janus is "fair to him." (Note: I think Thomas and Joan are taking advantage of a double meaning in this line, using "him" to be Janus and Nico, because "him" in this case could be Nico, but grammatically, I'm pretty sure that's an antecedent for Janus so hhhhh -- )   After SvSR, with three of the key sides not present (Virgil, Logan, and Remus), and Roman leaving after exchanging harsh words with Janus, it was clear that accepting him as a side wasn't going to be as simple as accepting Virgil. Even including Virgil took another few episodes after the explicit choice made in AA part two, including another one dedicated to the topic, "Fitting In." Accounting for Janus' transitional period even in an aside (in an Asides video, no less :P) was just extremely satisfying, even though we might get another video in the main series to further cement Thomas' acceptance of Janus. BUT AASDLFSDFHKSHDAGD THIS EP WAS SO GOOD I HAVEN'T WRITTEN AN ESSAY COMMENT LIKE THIS IN AGES AND IT'S ABOUT LITERALLY ONE FREAKING LINE OF DIALOGUE
I kinda worried for Virgil he anxiety it switch from purple to black when ever he's worried...
Why do I ship Virgil and Roman so hard after this vid?!?! OMG
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL'S GLITTER EYE SHADOW???? HELLO??
Remember this           *He is talking to himself the whole time*
I got a TS ad for his patrion right as the video was gonna start  How coincidental
Wh- right before the thing started it was an ad- so i thought nothing of it and then- I saw fucking *Janus* . In my ad. Right before the thing. Coincidence? i think *NOT!*
FINALLY WE HAVE ANOTHER EPISODE THANK YOU THOMAS
this was too cute, I'm gonna cry 🥺
That was so cute
He still looks like a 50 year old trying to stay hip lol
WOHHHHH 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 YEAAA GO TOM!... US.... THOMAS. WOOOOH yea! Confidence!         Only one? Ok...
I love this episode qwq
So... does this mean Thomas has someone?
CAN I PLS SEE THE IRL NICO FLORES AND/OR PLAY HIMMMMMM
that def hit home XD
Pfft. Stickers on a laptop aren’t gay!! And which gays put pins on their bags???   (Me, a very gay, with infinite stickers on the outside and inside of my laptop and pride pins all over my rainbow unicorn backpack.....)
*Thomas says Alex's name* Me: *begins crying*
oh my god, a new sanders- wait why is  it "Sanders A- *sees intro* oh ok i get it a new sanders *A*sides! wait a minute *animation?*
Omg I cried
okay here are the things that go me this episode, Gerad Gay, the yugioh pin and the fact that the other guy looks like Dr Maruki from Persona 5 Royal
I like animation version better
oh my gosh. i am just trying to flirt through text, which i think is so difficult, and i get really anxious. and i’ve been asking people what to and no one helps me. i am really glad you made this video that you so much. you have literally read my mind. and especially in a sander sides?! now i’m gonna get help and have fun watching it. i actually clicked on youtube to watch something else and then i saw this and almost cried cause it’s exactly what i need. i haven’t even watched it yet because i just clicked on it right away and came here to thank you for this video. so once again, thank you so much
Virgil "What did you say?" Thomas "Had a good day today, hehe . Heart with an arrow in it" Virgil his eyeshadow turning back to black.  "huh?.....delete it."
I’ll say this right now my embarrassment and cringe peeked when he tried to walk up to the guy and when he rehearsed the whole speech while the guy was in the stall the whole time listening and I had this urge to skip so badly but really it’s scary to talk to someone you’ve been wanting to talk to for so long and you never built up that confidence I don’t have confidence so don’t catch me in a cafeteria actually don’t catch me outside lol
I have a question Tomas. What do you think about the “side ships”?
Also, oh god, this episode has the Prinxiety shippers s c r e a m i n g
This is the best animation I ever seen      ITS SO CUTE 🙃
Yassssssss my ship is coming true virgil × Roman   And the part where the guy is tell thomas about his idea for the song  Thomas was like:👁👄👁 you saw me fall into that trash can didn't you  Me laughing and choking on my spit:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I haven’t watched but I’m sure there is some prinxiety
12:30 Virgil is so adorable, awww. MY ASEXUAL AND AROMANTIC SELF PLATONICALLY LOVE HIM SO MUCH, AND ANIMATIC VERSION IS EVEN BETTER. JYGERUFAB
"I'm gonna need you to shake your hands" stimmy boi
I Honestly thought a normal Sander sides episode being in a animattion wouldnt be that good =^=' but this was amazing! I love the artstyle!
Virgils highlight though👌
"Huh...delete it"💀💀💀 IM DEAD
Hello I just found this channel I remember watching your vines and I love this video you made me so happy with your vines
This was beautiful <3
i love thissss  (also ik the uwu virg stans are gonna come for me but oh my god, i want to sock him. i have never wanted to knock someone’s teeth out more. even if they’re fictional. and a figment of thomas’s imagination.)
That was art. Also that art was a thing of beauty.
AGGHH THIS IS TOO CUTE STAWWPP MH HEART CAN’T TAKE IT 🥺🖤🖤
I'm probably gonna get some hate for this. But did anyone else feel a spark between roman and Virgil at the end or was that just me?😆😅 I'm probably gonna get some hate for this!😅
Omg!!! Fantastic work my guy love this!!!❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I've got second-hand anxiety from this situation because it's too much..
I've enjoyed your creativity ever since Vine (Yes, that OLD thing *Hee hee😜*) I just got to say it's been a blast watching your content evolve and grow. Thank you for sharing such relatable, heartwarming, (much needed) humorous and energy packed stories. Always looking forward to new and awesome creations. Stay safe. Stay healthy y'all.  "Peace out"👍
AWWWWW ✨I'm crying ✨
OMG Virgil's eyeshadow changing from black to purple when he's excited is my favourite thing EVER!!!!
Guys.  Did nobody see the hearts between princey and Virgil at the end there?!  Me thinks I see some prinxiety...
My heart...my gay heart TwT
omg wtf happens after the outtro... poor thomas 🥺     _...can’t wait to see what the angst fanfiction writers have to say about that_
AWWWW THAT WAS SO CUTE
roman: yEA, jOin mE!! roman: *no thinking!*
oml that was so good man my heart got fluffy sjvirgjosgxbjosetg
So much ship fuel
i love this so much it was so cute and the my chem reference made me so happy the whole video did
Ok ok we need Logan and Pat too cause just Roman and Virgil is not working
Raise your hand if you got secondhand anxiety ✋🏻   I love the purple eyeshadow so much
It’s R-oman  with an “R”
“I hate to rain on your Black Parade Gerard gay!” -Roman 2020   I cackled!
THIS IS SO CUTE!
GERARD GAY
EVERYBODY LISTEN.       BRAVERY.......... IS THE ORANGE SIDE.
Please please give us this in live action
I just wanted to thank you for this video. My grandmother pass away the same day it was uploaded and I've been rewaching it before I go to sleep so I have something not that sad in my mind before going to bed. I love your content, thank you ♥️
not gonna lie this made me really happy
Omgosh deceit in Thomas’s mind just *gay panic* 😆
Yay more sander sides
are you really gay????? no homo... i totally support you if you are
A bit of Roman x Virgil at the end so romantic. Also I hope you get the guy Thomas ^^
ok but Virgil's eye shadow!!!!!!!!
I want to join but I can't I'm so sorry! 😔
Roman X Virgil
My anxiety is rising-
Omg yessss I would love to see a person sides video so much
I miss thomas. This content makes my heart so happy.
I don’t think Virgil’s name is Virgil. I think this because the “Light sides” have specific ending syllables, LogAN RomAN PattOn but the 2 of the 3 known “dark sides” have different ending syllables, JanUS, RemUS. But Virgil’s name doesn’t follow that trend. What if Virgil is not his real name, and I know for a fact that there is 1 more dark side. On the thumbnail for the Selfishness vs Selflessness Redux video, the character selection menu is obviously separated into light and dark sides (Logan Patton and Roman being on the top and Virgil Remus and Janus being in the bottom) but there is one picture on the bottom left blank, with just a silhouette visible. So maybe Virgil is not his name, and maybe there is one more dark side. Let us know Thomas.
AJSJSHSBSBS WHY AM I CRYING????
Omg I new this was gonna be good but this was 100000090% Bette then I thought can u make more 😯
Prinxiety is my favorite ship
OMG WAIT VIRGILS MAKEUP TURNED PURPLE WHEN HE WAS HAPPY!!!!
19:39 That’s the right time
That moment of panic Virgil had, that heavy breathing before just jumping in blind, I love that. I'VE FELT THAT so many times. It was a nice detail, and tons of times I've felt stuck in that panic state without taking the jump.  I wonder if Virgil will become more comfortable with the idea of jumping forward into things a little more and trusting the other sides for what they also want.
I really needed to see that.
Wrong time
4:34 AHHH it was so cute sorry i just ship this ∩^ω^∩
All the music references I’m LIVING
the eyeshadow change THE EYESHADOW CHANGE
I Know art and animatics take a very long time but I really loved this format tbh id love to see more of it if possible
Im sorry but this video has so much panic its funny. (Not trying to offend anyone)
i AM SO EMOTIONAL
FINALLY
i so want this to happy and for you to be happy and i littaraly had a gay panic watching this. ok so i made a video mixing part of the animatic with strawberry blonde and i need your permission to post it because i feel uncomfortable posting stuff with out the creators permission thank you
Click here to skip the beginning 2:20
Love it love it love it 💘
unrelated but. that is a dope castle in the back
I love this so much
Is it just me or does it look like Thomas hasn't been getting much sleep, please get some sleep, now I dont really know what is going on in your life but sleep is needed so is food, please get some food and sleep.
This made me cry i relate to this also this reminds me of in a heartbeat <3 I love this
I know this isn’t real but omigosh I teared up
This gave me butterflies :(
I LOVE this as animation! It's such a cool new take on Sanders Sides!
i love it i almost cryed
Aww this was so cute! <3
Purple eyeshadow boi!!!!
I loved this-
I’m absolutely in love with the style of this video! While it would be cool to maybe see it in live action, the cartoon perspective is just amazing. Thomas is a talented actor, but I feel using cartoons allows a bit more freedom with acting choices that an actual person would be limited to. Ten out of ten, would recommend.
"dont tell me to relax!" I FELT THAT
17:09 AHHH HE CARES ABOUT ROMAN MY SHIP IS SAILING AHHHHH
Not gonna lie I legit got so excited (and may have cried) at the end. That was the most precious thing ever! Also I feel that anxiety high key.
I need the irl version of the "gay eyes" lol
Imagine the dude he saw at the shop just watching this-
Rise to the occasion, You’re making a mistake ummmmmm were those Hamilton references or I’m just crazy
Wait. Roman and Virgil are teaming up?! 19:34 you _do_ realise this is fuel for the ships ..... I don’t have a problem with that.
Okay, but is no one gonna talk about Virgil's eyeshadow at the end? I am liking the light purple
Two things 1: Virgils purple eyeshadow was perfect for him and I love how it was added when he was happy and fanboying  2: I also love how the whole video was pretty much prinxiety moments
List of best moments as I watch for first time: -The whole thing -4:10
Me: I want that shirt  Also Me: but I have no money
THUS IS SO EMO YES
The fact that if I was in a similar situation I would feel guilty for finding the girl pretty at all in the first place and would leave crying
I think this video is hinting at eventually accepting Janus because Virgil keeps getting mad a Thomas for little everyday lies.
You show make another Animatic
Hmmmmmm could be gayer
Janus tee.....? *Janus tea...?* *J A N U S    T E A!*
Okay the eyeshadow going from purple to black when he got anxious was so cool!!!!
The ending scene. I SCREAMED WITH JOY. PRIXINITY IS "MAYBE" REAL!!
The animatic was amazingly well done but gosh this is a story that would have been great to see in live action 😅
I loved this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqRn19aS5XY
This is deap I am so moved.
Virgil: that was a test and you failed Thomas: you were testing me?...:( Virgil: oh nah nah nah I was just panicking
MAN DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ME CRY?!
A patreon goal better be to have you dress up as frieza.
this video somehow made me more confident in myself
Okay that was enough confirmation Virgil and Roman are thing😁😁💞
I- isksaisjissndnsjskdoxidodkwjsnwksoxodpdkdk was this whole video just subtly prinxiety ?  Cuz it seemed like it
We don't know if he's NOT gay. Whenever I try to flirt with another girl as a biromantic, Also that was the cutest and most relatable thing ever. I cannot count how many times ive seen a cute emo girl in Hot Topic and thought (but I don't know if she likes girls) just... thank you, and I'm definitely going to watch more
Awwwwe this made me so happy
:O
WAIT IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VIRGIL’S HAPPY EYESHADOW??😭😭😭
i have a question where can you buy merch???
Anyone else have huge Prinxiety vibes from this video
Why is Roman giving off Natsu Dragneel energy and Virgil giving off Grey Fullbuster energy😃🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️
friendly reminder to everyone in the comment section that the term "gay panic" actually refers to a law that allows homophobes to attack gay people under the pretense that them being gay scared the homophobe into committing an act of violence against them so maybe dont use it as a funny thing
EeEEeEEeEeeEEeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
MY HEART AGGGHH
I love this!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕
Make Thomas a Disney prince already
I loved this!
Just me that noticed how virgils eye shadow changed based on his mindset lol
Ok, but why is this actually me flirting??
“I don’t know- plant...”   That is the most relatable thing I’ve heard-
Did NOT know he was gay. But good for you i saport. 🌈 🦄
I don't know if I belong here because this isn't gay but I need advice. I have a crush and she and I know each other but don't really talk much, I am going insane because I'm not talking to her but that's only because I haven't had a clear chance to, and I only see her during band for one hour.  What do I do? It would take more courage than I have to talk to her without a clear opportunity, and even when I talk to her what do I say, please help. Also I'm not looking to ask her out, I'm only a mid-early teen and she's a year older than me, I just want to spend time with her.
as a young simple gay: <3
This video was the perfect exaple of prinxiety and im soaking  it UP
the pRinXiEtY-
Omg i just realized that in the episode the dark side of Disney he says he hates carrots
This brings me so much confidence and encouragement to shoot my shot more often... maybe, just maybe, I'll go for it and not be so afraid. Fantastic work as usual Thomas and team!!
Its Thomco (Thomas + Nico)
I LOVE the changing eyeshadow on Virgil! Is he expressing bravery and happiness?! Omg amazing stuff!
Omg....this was precious
"Top of the morning to ya.." ladies?
You’re like that one kid who can’t find out who his theatre voice is gonna be
As a very small critique, the purple line work is really hard to distinguish from the black linework, possibly in the future add a solid colour somewhere on each of the sides to help differentiate each side? 😅
Why am I crying??? This is fucking adorable
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW
Who else thinks that virgil is a medium? Like between the light and dark? I feel like he was originally a dark side but he doesn't quite qualify himself a light side I dont think either... so sence anxiety can be a light and a dark thing I think hes a medium and at some point. He may become Bravery?? I dont know.. maybe hes two, two sides of himself for when hes able to convey something besides what he thinks he is. Bravery is litteraly almost, if not, the polar opposite of anxiety which is what he litteraly is... and if this is essential to the story... is.. he both bravery and anxiety? Orange and purple?
This was beautiful, I'm legit crying cuz I have really bad gay panics
I'm at 14:13 and he better still be there when he gets back Edit: YES! I LOVE IT
19:57 me awwww gay
I can't get over the Patreon "federal education budget" 😆
That was so cute, literally the cutest romance story I’ve watched so far 🥺♥️
Thomas TvT..... when I say you have saved me more times than I can count... I MEAN IT💕
OMG I SHIP IT XD  And wow the animation is beautiful!
This was so cute!!! I love it!! I was literally crying, no joke 🥺🥺😭😭
This was PHYSICALLY PAINFUL to watch but it was entirely worth it for everything Janus at the end. 😍
why is no one talking about the prinxiety moment at the end- like...... its- gy4frhekdlw
There was two love stories in this I believe :> but that’s up to you all ;v;
will you post more sander sides Thomas?🥺🥺🥺
Did anyone else thought when Nico said “ do you mind telling me about them?” He was referring to Roman and Virgil? Does he see them? Or just meant to understand what he was going through? Both could be consider personal
I LOVE IT it’s so cute
prinxiety shippers are screaming
me: thinking that thomas is hinting that he has a special someone.
AH I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS! ALSO.. OMG I LOVE Virgils purple make-up!!!!!
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k future
I love that when Virgil is feeling really excited his eyeshadow changes to purple and shiny
wow just wow
Happy Virgil with purple eyeshadow is a mood
Sanders A-sides? dont get it
Oh! My! God! The best love story ever!!!!! Omg that was amazing!!!
“ ieghhrrdunno p laAnt”
I FELT EVERY EMOTION WATCHING THIS I LOVE THIS EPISODE !!!!
Plz don’t stop releasing blooper videos!!! I would die for those but I don’t have money
I wanna watch an anime about this...
GOD DAMMIT MY GAY HEART AHHHHHGH
this whole video be like: *gay panic, gay panic aAaAhhH*
The fact that he mentioned Gerard Way... I squealed at that
19:53 this honestly makes me ship Roman x Virgil (whatever his name is QwQ)
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOWSIXSBZUJSHXKSNSN HES A BEAUTIFUL EGO BABY BOI ZIDONWHXUX
“STOP! Get out! The episode is over!”   That made me laugh really hard-
We don't know if he's NOT gay--what a mood, honestly my brain when I'm lurking in the corner telling myself that girl must be straight bc everyone is straight even though.... everyone I know is... not LMAO
Tomas x Nico (I ship it!)
when i glanced at the tittle and saw "flirt" and "Anxiety" i was like AWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEA BOISSS
AAAAA MY HEART!
This is pretend right he isn’t really gay
AA
I ship Roman and Virgil so much
I Relate to this too much
That was amazing
Video: Roman:-start speaking from the heart- Ad pops up: *HI IM MARKIPLIER!* Me: MOTHERF-- MY EARS!  I had the volume super low and then that AFK Arena ad pops up, it was soooo loud! My poor ears, I wasn't even wearing headphones!
I like that Virgils eyeshadow changes in the end
I LITERALLY SCREAMED WITH THEM AT THE END
prinxiety moment at 19:39   .........      yes
That was AMAZING I loved it!! I hope you create some more!!
Oh my GOSH I loved  T H I S!  IT WAS PERFECT!  I WISH I HAD MONEY TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR PATREON!!!!
*we gay*
Loved the animation. The whole story was so cute
I Dunno! PLaNt
I'm not the only one who ships Roman and Virgil. Right?
I didnt understand why they animated this one at first then I saw the trashcan scene XD
HE HAS SPARCKLY MAKUP FOR WHWNE HES HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!
thisissocutethisissocutethisissocute-
Poor Thomas, that's a bad case of homofomo
"So... Stalking? OH YOU'RE RIGHT"  😂😂😂
Omfg do I smell some prinxiety!! 😆😆😆😆😆
BLACK PARADE JOKES AND BLINK REFERENCES I LOVE THIS EPISODE
Roman’s ‘Shut up EMO’ got me somehow. Got me bad. IDK the delivery murdered me.
yay!!
kyaaaaaaaa ~ *fangirling*
If Roman and Virgil kissed at the end i would've burst into tears this video is SO BEAUTIFUL
This video was so adorable!
Usually when my anxiety pushes me, it’s AWAY from people.
Can we talk about how Virge's eyeshadow is purpleeeeeeee. Like a certain Duke whom I love lmao ;3
I just recently got diagnosed with social anxiety so these videos have new appreciation from me <3
Nico: *explaining his song idea* Thomas: ...you saw me knock over that trash can, didn’t you?  🤣🤣🤣🤣 Thats my favorite part!! 🤣  But, it’s a super cute video and I loved it!!
Wait, Thomas asked if he was ready and Anxiety wasn't stressed but Thomas was stressed so. Is Virgil getting better at hiding his fear
Virgil's eyeshadow change from black to purple when he's happy 🖤💜I saw that.
Externally screams in “end me end me end me, it’s too cute” and “I’m somehow seeing hidden Prinxiety in it”
BUT JANICE IS RUNNING IT
it it bad and/or weird i kinda want tosee some pinxiety stuff?
I'M FOUR DAYS LATE BUT PURIK IT, I LOVE IT! AND I'LL KEEP WATCHING IT!
Love how Virgil's eye makeup changes depending on his anxiety levels neat and subtle touch!
i've been watching you for as long as a can remember but I still cant figure out if you are apart of the LGBTQ+ or not
I've never in my life related to something more than "Thomas I'm gonna need you to shake your hands" LIKE
“shut up emo” i’m gunna CRY
This is my tenth time watching this and I have no regrets
10:57 MY social anxiety: **verbal equivalent of a keyboard smash**
"I'm just now realizing how thin my apartment walls are" *Proceeds to speak in a very loud voice for the video*
TOPPA THE MORNIN TO YA
This was absolutely adorable and amazing.    The thing that caught my attention is Virgil’s changing eyeshadow color in the end. It kept switching between purple and black.
This is how gay I need my life to be
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I'm freaking out bc  1 bc new ep 2 Thomas love story 3 plz don't be toxic I ship Prinxity Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I had to run around the room to
the second hand embarassment is so strong it's unreal
THAT WAS THE BEST THING I UAVE EVER SEEN EEEEEEEEE :oooo
SOOO CUTE!!💕😍💕😍
Holy shite i relate too hard to this
I never been more invested in anything than I was just now
MY HEART I CANT TAKE IT
I clicked for the gay panic and stayed for priniaty
Yay Thomas Sanders videos again!!! (I really want Pattan cosplay but I can't find any) 🥺
That made me so happy oh my goodness 🥺
OMG IM LATEEEEEE
Omg! That was so cute!!!!!
One problem I didn’t see my nerd boi!!!!!
This was the cutest episode, omg I love it. Congratulations to everyone involved, great work
Wait so do Virgi;'s dark circles turn shimmery purple when he's happy/excited?
TELL YOU THOMAS THAT HES GOTTA RISE UP RISE UP
Yeah live action would be cool but also ANIMATE THIS!!
I INSTANTLY TEARED UP AT THAT LAST LINE FROM NIKO
13:27 ouch...felt that  in my soul
10:29 is when the puns happen
There was so much gay panic and overall social awkwardness here, I could literally feel my anxiety screaming at me
OH MY GAWD. WHEN VIRGIL GETS EXCITED/HAPPY HIS EYE BAG/EYESHADOW TURNS FROM BLACK TO PURPLE
This is definitely the pick me up I needed this week. I can't tell you how many times I've rewatched this, I just love it so much
Am i the only one that thought "is he gay or European"?
Virgil found his prince and Thomas found his prince (if the story is true, which I hope it is)
8:18   When I tell you I screamed
*This entire thing is just gay panic.*
This was so heart warming and beautiful, not only in the sense that we got the guy (which, btw, OMYGOSH YAYYY!!) but the fact that a part of someone was able to break through their shell after missing so many chances and wishing so badly that they could seize love!! What a gorgeous message I LOVED THE ARTSTYLE TOO!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰💖💖✨✨
Imagine actually succeeding in the end...
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IT THAT A LEGO CASTEL
Virgil and Roman with the tag team
Ow. My heart
PLEASE TELLL ME THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE ADORABLE
I dunno...plant.... MOOD
Who remembers vine
That gay panic screaming at the end
That happens 30 times a day please calm down. You got to love a good call back.
Adjalshla this is adorable Also i was waiting for Logan and Patton to pop up like "what going, what happened, what wed miss?
19:34 to 20:00 *screams in prinxiety bc I'm just like that*
IS PRINXIETY CANON NOW?! JHSKJHSKJHS
look at virgils face at 15:39-
Is like no one gonna point out virgil's makeup like when he was being happy and not anxious it was a pretty shiny purple and then like it would go back to normal when he was acting like his usual self or just me(it might be because my art teacher is rubbing of on me and now I see a whole lot me things and is super observant now)
10:24 oh dear, poor Patton...  Roman: try, speaking from the heart... YouTube: *Rise and shine, it’s unskippable ad time!*
I love the subtle nod to Miss You by Blink-182
Dude I forgot what Deciets name was and spit water everywhereeeeeee
“Thomas I’m gonna need you to shake your hands? You gotta do something with them.” I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID THAT
13:14 who else's heart broke at the sight of Roman looking in the mirror...
My prinxiety heart ❤️
THIS WAS SO CUTE.... and hit really close to home, but let's not talk about that😂 This was extremely worth the wait. I was so excited for the next episode, and this is way better than I expected
I feel called out! hahahaha. Love this Thomas the video was great and really puts social anxiety in a light.
This is so beautiful ÚvÙ.
*Insert me fangirling for 3 days cause of this video*
The entire time I was just jumping around and going so cute at the end.  Before that I was holding my head and say "noooo!" 😂 i guess I was just in geek out mode.
Thomas: top of the morning to ye Me being irish: stop...
I AM STRAIGHT AS FRICK BUT THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
awwwwwwwwww adorkable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Virgil: No, you're making a mistake! Roman: if am, I'll add it to the list! Me: *cry*
IM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS EPISODE I CANNOT EVEEEEEENNN
I noticed a blink 182 reference :D
Thomas, I loveeeeeee ur videos, they make me smile and laugh every time. Thank you so much for doing what you are doing, I know you help a lot of people feel better with these videos, me included. This video was so funny and I can’t wait to see if you remake it in live-action!
I did not ship prinxety until 19:58
I FRICKIN LOVE THIS ITS SO CUTE AHHHH IM SQUEALIIING
r we gonna ignore the hearts around romans face when he said “shut up emo” guyz pls i’m going INSANE
I loved this so much. It actually gave me a bit of comfort when it comes to talking to new people.
if thomas had a discord i would so attempt a gay off
This had me straight up sweating cause I can feel others emotions and predict them by feeling them even if their fictional and this took a lot out of me 😂
Underappreciated moment, Roman: "Join me! No thinking!!" Real himbo hours big mood
This is my new favorite episode
this was posted on my birthday, best gift ever.  :')
19:29 i started crying from HAPPINESSSS
This is really great!
Thomas in the bathroom by himself...
I really love thuis video an the end was so cute🥺😅😊
Awww Virgil pushes Thomas because he noticed that Roman was upset 🥺🥺🥺🥺
All of the sander sides are such homiesexuals
Haha the bromance tho             (Virgil and Roman's bromance is the best in my opinion)
No one gonna note the great moment when Virgil says “He FeaRs ThINgS ToO!?”
I love this! The whole story and the animatic is just- *French Kiss* I  Love it!❤️✨👑🏳️‍🌈
I'm crying the end I'm softtttt
I forgot who Janas was and I feel bad for forgetting the snake boi.
THIS IS ADORABLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where are you? And I'm so sorry.  Smooth reference Virgil. 5:18
The eyeshadow.
the sheer amount of secondhand embarrassment this gave me
The second the animatic started, I got an ad for depression and anxiety... coincidence? Maybe
Am I the only one who noticed the change of eye shadow?   Like for example  every time Virgil got happy it changed to a light purple and when he got sad it changed back to black🧐🧐  Like or reply if you Noticed it to :D 👇🏻                         👇🏻
OMG THIS IS SO AMAZING i can't stop smiling
thomas: i tend to waist a lot of opportunities in life niko: well lets not waist this one Roman: shut up- Virgil: shut up- Roman: sHUt uP- Me: SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!! me one the inside: EEEEEKKKKKKKKK!!!!!
Payton and Logan need to be in the next episode.
I WANT THIS.
When I clicked on this video, I was 110% expecting to have a WHOLE bunch of prinxiety. . . .  WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
Why does Virgils eyeshadow keep changing?
get a discord
i ship it both nico x thomas aswell as roman x virgl
OML.... Thomas's monolog in the bathroom almost moved me to tears, if someone ever said that to me I probably would've cried ahdajdfjawoefawj it was so sweeet
HIS NAME IS NICO!!!!!!! Bruh that’s my nameeeeeeee

OMG I love everything! The story and the art and EVERYTHING! This made my day! Thanks!<3
I literally felt like I was about'a explode when I heard that this came out!!!!!!!
Woah wait Virgil get purple under eye makeup when he’s excited like the irl part at the very end it definitely means something
...i think I may 😢 😿...i came here for Vergle and found a cartoon...i hope this gets made real...I can't connect to animation
the way i screamed when i saw virgil’s shimmery purple eyeshadow it suits him so much!!! 🥺🥺🥺
Some people - Great video!  The other people- Prinxitiny (can't spell)
This episode described gay panic, and I can't get over it. This was a whole mood😌
I LOVE how Virgil’s under shadow changes color depending on how he feels.
Why am I just now finding out that Sanders is gay?
VIRGIL’S EYEBAGS TURN PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY/EXCITED/OPTIMISTIC OH MY GOD AHHHH THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING THOMAS
Wholesome 100
His little nervous laughs 😭😭
“we don’t know if he’s NOT gay” is my new life motto
Wow I got the chills at a few parts lmao
I'll definitely be watching this again! It feels so organic and honest.
This was brilliant!
*JANUS’ CORRIDOR OF STORED REWARDS*     _e_
Everyone be talkin about "rain on your black parade" but not "We can live like Jack and Sally if you want"
19:50 had to be the cutest thing EVERRRRRR
Ugh the blush I ship it prince go get ur mans 19:50 THE LITTLE HEARTS UGH I LOVE THAT Btw Thomas im so sorry the ships will be nonstop now and now you made it canon it might not be but we both know it is
*Claps*      *Sheds a tear*
I am sorry (idk if I should say sorry or not so I am just going to say sorry) but I actually really like the animated version better so far
I think I am going to ship this
ah yes, the all-consuming fear
Honestly think this is my new favorite episode
This was amazing, holy bananas, also Thomas being trademarked as a disaster gay is amazing (Don’t worry I’m a disaster bi) and this made me feel less self conscious about it
Omggg this was so cute I loved that so much!!
I just love when Thomas has a gay panic-
Anyone else notice how Virgil's eye shadow changed color when he was happy?  I love how the crew has such attention to detail!  (Edit:  Just re-watched this.  It was also nice to see Virgil so happy.  🙂)
While watching this I got two adds on Janus’s patreon ad’s
I LOVE HOW VIRGIL'S EYE MAKEUP WAS BRIGHT AND SPARKLY PURPLE WHEN HE WAS SO EXCITED
Im squealing soooo hard right now i was yelling through the screen omg i love you and your friend creativity thomas thanks for the smile on my face
CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE CUTE AHHHHH
I love it how I got a Thomas Sander's ad for his patreon in a Sander sides video
"Here, you go, enjoy your food/movie/etc."  "Thanks, you too."  🙃🙃
nononononononononono stop talking they are therrrrrrrreeeeeee they are gonna be there.
This is honestly so beautiful and true. Thank you for making this, it really made my day. The animation the story, AMAZING. It was the cutest thing ever.
OMG I couldnt stop smiling!!!!! I love this!  An artist myself I tried making an animatic too, this is more than i could have ever dreamed of. I would love to see a live action video of this toO!  Im just so happy to see sanders sides! Its my favorite

Prienxiety shipers assemble

My prinxiety shipping heart is screaming-  Also great video!❤️
This was an amazing video , I wish I could get patreon , I'll try but it was really good , I loved it
O.            M.             Gggggggggg!!!!!!! This is so cute so adorable what an animation and I can do relate as a bisexual me: cute girl  but is she gay.nooo. But what if.  Noooooo . Ok definitely no . Dang it she’s gone ohhhh cute bbboy and that is my life there
I love how funny he is, but I didn’t know that Thomas was gay. I’m sooo late.
24:05 and 24:12 are so perfect lmao
Umm does anyone see that only VIRGIL and ROMAN are the only ones there ....       #prinxiety Edit:giv me likezzzzzzzzz 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙃🙃🙃🙃 19:59 is just adorable
I only got patreon to listen to yagami yato hehehehe...he...he dont look it up
Does Virgil's makeup turn purple when he's happy??
I don’t know if it’s just me who’s new to seeing it but I just realized Virgil’s eye shadow changes color and shape (?) depending on how he’s feeling. It starts as purple and closer to his eyes but it grows outward and changes to black when he gets more anxious. Idk I just picked up on that and I thought it was a cool little thing. Like at 22:54 to 22:59 was where I saw it
It’s been so long since I got to see your Channel. I hope you’re doing good and I missed you and your content so much.
OMG THIS IS ACTUALLY CUTE, AND HELPFUL, AND AWESOME, AND INSPIRING AT THE SAME TIME I LOVE IT, I LOVE YOU, I LOVE EVERYTHING, THANK YOU *VITURAL HUGS* that's a bit of a weird way to say thank you so.. thank you :D
*I got a Deceit ad right after the first 2 minutes*
VIRGIL AND ROMAN ARE SO CUTE
Yay I’m not the only one that talks to himself randomly
the change in the eyeshow for virgil 🥺🥺🥺 ITS SO CUTE
Ok,but like why are virgle and roman act like sweet kinda clingy parents.🥺
Right about at the song park and when he said “let’s not waste this one “ I swore to got I was about to cry
"What are you doing?" "I dunno, plants(?" JSHJASHJASHASJHASASHAHASJH FELT THAT TO THE CORE
T_T
I LOVED THAT!!! It was really good keep it up everyone!
Omg that ship moment at the end is the best
Please do more soon
Did he really meet Niko?
I hate to *rain* on your *black parade* Gerard *Gay*   I've never felt so personally called out  in one single quote
Am I the only one that’s shocked that he is in his 30s just me okay 😳😳
AHHHHHH THIS IS TO CUTE FOR MY ONE BRAIN CELL TO HANDLE😍💕
This is amazing.
Honestly I'm not a fan of gay, but this is making my heart went *AJSHSJAKEHKSJDJSDHJSZ*
That was so gay I wanted to scream of happiness!!!!!!!
THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTE AND RELATABLE AND I LOVE IT
Awwwwwwwwwww❤😍🌈 Thats so freakin cute!

I feel like princeanxiety is canno now a little no? Just me ok.
96
Oooh, Virgil's eye make up changing is very interesting ~ Also I love the purple eyeshadow it looks so good and so does the black. You can really tell someone put a lot of time into it! 💜
I loved this so much!!! I'm really sad that I can't join the patreon. Alsooooo, don't think that I didn't see the purple under Virgil's eyes when he was super happy, Thomas!! x
Gay until proven straight ✨
I didn't cry, n-no i'm not crying- Y-YOU'RE CRYING!
I am late because I was on holiday with no WiFi or service but still good video I also liked virgils purple eyeshadow
i love how he’s watching “Single” and it’s rated R+
*while all of this is happening where is Patton and Logan?*  Logan: do u have any Kings?  Patton: there’s one in front of me :3  Logan: >//////< I GET IT UR ADORABLE!  Patton: sorry!...... go fish
BRO I- MY LAST NAME IS FLORES I SWEAR
Thomas really decided to tug on my heart strings in this video huh
OMG THE SWITCH BETWEN THE BLACK AND PURPLE GLITTER EYE SHADOW UNDER VIRGIL’S EYES WAS SUCH A CUTE DETAIL
The Blink-182 and MCR references gave me life!
Omg this was so cute and I haven't watched Sanders Sides in a while so this h i t 😭😭😭😭👌👌👌👌💞💞💞 I love iiitttt it's so cuuutttteee!!!!
OMG I GOT UR COMERCIAL ON THE VIDEO DECIET IS SO COOL
The title sounded gay and I never clicked faster in my life
NO I NEED MORE PLEASE GIVE ME MOOOOOOOOOORE
I would so love to be a voice actress because of this
Aw this was amazing
My little half-gay heart!! I love this!!
I love that you do these Thomas! Like how all 4 of y’all are I’m the same way with mine. Usually get called crazy but I don’t really care and when I first saw all of y’all I just couldn’t stop watching. Thank you Thomas. Thank you for making me not feel so...alone
Alternate title: Two gay dads help their gay son find a boyfriend while also making mean comments towards their son
I just discovered this show and i love it :)))
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
We need more sanders sides and the live action version
OH GOD THIS HIT SO CLOSE TO HOME I am such a gay disaster it took me literally 2 and a half years of hardcore crushing and adoring them from a far before telling my partner I like them. And coming up to them about it was like the button peek trashcan scene.
Hi Thomas, congratulations on the new video! I'd absolutely adore seeing this live action remade whenever that becomes a safe possibility.   I love the artstyle - it looks so sweet! The comedic timing is on point and you made me laugh out loud - hysterically - a ton! All of it was so cute, so sweet, so lovely!! I am so incredibly impressed. Also, the writing and storyboarding and character interactions are *chef's kiss*!  The subject of the video is something that has been bothering me more increasingly the past few months. I want a relationship with another person that is intimate and romantic. But when I see a cute person in public I don't even consider going up to them. Also, meeting new people give me a lot of anxiety. Especially the last part of the video hit me very hard, when you started talking about possibilities and regretting not going up to the guy afterwards. It confronted me with the things I refused to let myself think, because thinking about those possible futures makes me feel very very anxious.  And when Virgil  made Thomas go up to the guy - when those doubts and fears turned into courage - and talk to him in his own honest and awkward way, and it /went well/, it nailed the point home to me about what I was doing and I could be missing out on.   I think I've been so focused on the bad things that could happen, that any possible good thing would not be worth it.  "It's true. I do tend to waste a lot of opportunities in my life." You cut me while I was down, you smashed a brick of realization in my face and rubbed salt into the wounds.  It's good though. I think I needed to have that realization in order to process and move forward. I think I'll be able to look back at this and be glad it happened.  Now though? I'm crying and anxious about lost opportunities, old hurts and new hurts, the future and the past. I'll probably be struggling a lot with this for a while longer.  This realization sucks and it hurts, but because of your video I have learned more about myself than I did yesterday, and that is a good thing. Realization is the first step towards improvement and becoming a better person. Thank you for everything.  I've been scared to post this, but I'm just going to do it.
Wait hold on              So not only did Thomas get a love interest but PRIXITEY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED CANON I CANT
I recently got the one that said “has an ominous shadow ever steered you wrong before?” Immediately I thought of Bear in the Big Blue House lmao
My GOSH! That eyeshadow!!! Love it!
Just got an ad for Thomas’s Patreon while watching this video. 😂
I really loved this episode! Creative, funny, and quite honestly just adorable!! 🏳️‍🌈😊
This is fucking amazing
"You saw me fall in the trashcan, didn't you?"
SO GOOOOODDD!!!!!
THE HEARTS WHEN HE SAID SHUT UP EMO
this was so cute X3
I no joke started crying when Roman said, "Shut up, emo". And Virgil blushed and I have never been more happy in my entire lifeeeeeeeeeeeee
I'm so happy this was made. I love your videos and I love animation, so this beautifully honest animated video was really wonderful to watch and listen to. Thank you Thomas :')
I got an ad for Thomas’s Patreon and I’m ashamed to say it took me a good 9 seconds to realize that it wasn’t part of the video
I'm not crying you're crying
IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR A NEW SANDER SIDES EPISODE AND HERE IT IS EEEEEEE
WAIT THEORY TIME THEORY TIME!!!  I think Niko can see the sides!! when Roman and Virgil are talking over each other while Niko brings the food that C! Thomas left, he interrupts and (i think) says "You're not gonna tell me about that?" seemingly out of nowhere. BUT Roman and Virgil were arguing about phone numbers and calling him and such. I don't know if this is the kind of thing that would be canon, but it seems weird that Niko talks during them screaming while C! Thomas himself is silent and then never addressed again. Again, just a theory but it would be so interesting if this was the case!
THE EYE SHADOW 🥺😭💞💖💓💖✨! THIS WHOLE VIDEO!! THE HAND SHAKING AT THE END REALLY CALLED ME OUT!! ✨✨✨✨ I DIDN’T KNOW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THIS VIDEO TILL I SAW ITTTT
I SCREECHED WHEN I SAW ABD ILLUSTRATES But I was also screaming when the guy left AND when Virgil just yeeted Thomas Love love loved this, I can't wait to see moree
24:04 GAH DEMON- made me laugh so much :'>
Not me losing it when Roman makes a ,':3 face
"You gotta stop doing that."  "Wooing people in the bathroom?"
*Clap clap clap*
I’ve only seen the vines :|
If there was a bark does that mean if I call you Thomas then....... DO WE GET A FREE DOG!!??! 🤩
I-... it was so BEAUTIFUL I CRIED!!! (T^T)
Did I literally just get an ad BY Thomas before watching a THOMAS VIDEO
the prinxiety fandom is quaking
*No kidding, I got a add for his Patreon when I clicked on the video-*   Edit: I happened again XD
This is great! Please do more animations :D
GERARD GAY!!!!!!! I CHOKED ON MY SODA
This could've all been avoided if you just did what all of us gay guys usually do: Open up every dating/chatting/hookup app and frantically try to find him and if you can't just assume he's straight then go home and cry! Work 100% of like 20% of the time!
ohhh the gay panic just overtook my soul
I got a Sanders sides ad and I've never been happier
That is sooo cute I will die!!! Alone
Me: *Is straight* Also me: *Relates to this video on a biological level*
Is anyone else's anxiety being triggered by watching Thomas's anxiety. Just me? Okay
HES BACK YAY
I cant decide who this romance is about. Roman and Virgil or Thomas and writer guy😂
It was so beautiful and how i wish every moment in my life went But you know.   so cool i absolutely love it keep up the good work man!
Prinxiety shippers are quaking.
the amount of references to emo music in this oh my god
Lol. The "he's better off without me" is far too familiar.
* WHEEZE * i had a thomas sanders Ad....In had janus.... But apart from that the animation and all is amazing!
OMG THE PURPLE EYESHADOW ON VIRGILL
I CRIED OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!
Teco for a ship name? It sounds like taco and teacup...
The second hand embarrassment hurts
OMG THIS IS JUST ADORABLE!!! THOMASSSSSS OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!
also THE EYE SHADOW
i've never seen virgil so excited
I LOVE the purple eyeshadow. Plus Virgil reaction to Roman telling him to relax, “Don’t tell me to relax!” That was just perfect
PRICIEXTY IS CANON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should make a lazy one
i dont know if thats always been a thing, but Virgil’s eyeshadow changing from purple to black depending on mood was a really nice touch! I really like how you show that there is a positive type of anxiousness!
Roman: what are you doing? Thomas: idk? plant.
Looks like there's two ships in this episode Thomas x Nico & Roman x Virgil :3
IS. NICO. REAL!?
Anyone else get a Thomas Sanders add
The amount of moods I went through in this video is astonishing-  This was also most of my gay panic in a nutshell lmao
ITS SO IRONIC THAT A SANDER SIDES AD CAME ON HERE
*How do all of my favorite YouTubers know each other*
Holy crap this was so cute!!!!!!
Omg I literally went ahead and at 8:49 got a ad for Thomas’s Patreon I’m laughing and freaking out at the same time
I know I had already commented on your Instagram post about this but I decided to post this here as well for a better chance that you might see it. What If in a future episode something happened were you hit your head leading Logan to lose his memories and gets and forgets who he is and that he is logic. You and Him are not acting like yourselves and the other sides have to bring him back by rap battle or other silly shenanigans.
do you like the owl house?
Roman: That Was Bravery   Me : SHUT UP
OHMYLORDTHATWASTOOPRECIOUSICANTTAKETHISOHMYGODIMGONNADIEHOLYCARPS
It's too cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Getting an ad for the patreon 👌
Damn I want this to be a film now. Jesus Thomas why?
That was freaking adorable
Oh my gosh! The art, the story, the witty fandom references, all in all an amazing episode. One that actually hit really close to home. I’m so glad you guys were able to find a safe way to make this! ❤️❤️
Well that was an emotional rollercoaster ride-  _A fabulously gay emotional rollercoaster ride_
Hello
I love the romance it’s it awe 🥺🥺
The Creep referenceeee
Anyone else get constant ads for the patreon on this video? XD
OMG VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW. Yessssssssssss. So cute!!!!!
This was the cutest thing ever!! Also so relatable😂
This was too cute and gay for my Heart🌈
:D
I had a shipper attack during this video Also I really like this animation!
Oof as soon as I save up, I’m 100% signing up for Patreon.
Awwwwwwww *long inhale* awwwwww. That was super cute
'What are you doing??'   'Uh y-you know...plant!'  Lol. I loved this so much, it was so adorable. Great job to everyone involved, not everyone has or understands anxiety but this sums it up pretty well.
“shut up emo”   SCREAMING
Not even fully five minutes in and I swear to whatever gods exists Roman is one of my best friends trying to set me up with any guy remotely attractive and Virgil is his boyfriend trying to tell him to chill while also trying to set me up with them......
I love the art style! It reminds me of Harold and the Purple Crayon
Oh Thomas u disaster gay
Punk...lil punk 🤣🤣
This was so wonderful!!!!!!!! I really do hope to get a live action version!
This made me a lot more emotional than I expected
any sandersides shipper ever: "yep another one for the Roman x Virgil ship"
“Shut up emo”-Roman
Legit Thomas thought of this video and went: K I want Princiety and Gay Panic, go
This was SOOOOOO CUTE!!!
So I watched this video earlier today and now I'm rewatching and the first thing that pops up is an add for Thomas' patreon before the actual video that mentions the patreon-
Ok ok I’m sorry but this mirror fail kinda got me laughing ;w;  13:45
I think I finally understood what my mom said about talking to people. I'm someone who can easily walk up to a stranger and say hi, and I didn't understand why other people had so much trouble. Keep in mind, I relate heavily to Thomas with conversations since I have no clue how to start one, but saying 'hi' is easy for me. After seeing this, I understand how hard it can be for other people. Thanks, Thomas. ^^  EDIT: I just noticed that the eyeshadow was a light purple and nearly gone, then Roman said 'if he's ready, we're ready. Then the black eyeshadow was back in full. His eyeshadow has to be in his powers or something-
is Mr.flores a real person or script character? or like the flores a stick in for privacy reasons in case it's a real person? is this long past medium past or relatively close past? details people details gotta have em details to fill in context. will hopes rise or fall to the arrival of answer's call? patience is torture to the suspended soul as it holds breath asphyxiated till final day's rest.
I just watched an ad about your patrion in your video
I can feel the gay panic of this animatic   I hate that I can relate to it xD
No one: Absolutely no one:  me:THOMAS YOU ADORABLE LITTLE CRAP, STOP MAKING MY HEART MELT.
My little anxious bi heart can’t take it I’m like that a lot
alright so can i say i FRICKING LOVE THIS VIDEO LIKE WOOOOOT omg i love gay people so much i just- hsgkshg i adored virgil with puple eyeshadow and being SOOOO EXCITED (also not to be weird but the repeated "you sure u dont wanna pee" made me think of thomas being *excited* if u know what i mean and thats like ljghlfhlfhsljh so cute) overall i did love the animation the story and just everything was so cute keep up the good work guys i wish i could be a patreon but *broke artist noises* maybe if i was good enough with my art i could help you with future animations or something  (my instagram is https://www.instagram.com/art_tu_bruhtus/  if u wanna see my work i have done stickman stopmotion animation before so ldjhlfjhlu ) good job thomas proud of you
I really want to join the patreon, but I'm broke ;-;
"Cutie at 12 o'clock" Roman Sanders
I just watched this on my way to my ENT. My ear is swollen shut from an ear infection. This really brightened up my day. Thanks, Thomas. 🙂
YES THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING EVER, THE STORY LINE, THE ROMANCE, AND THE ART! I'm in love
We love getting an add for Thomas's channel during a thomas sanders video
I have a video idea the sides can react to there memes
I had so much secondhand awkwardness from this video that I actively tried to hide myself in the fridge. I love it.
the ad i got before the video was for janus’ patreon thing....the only ad i won’t skip🥰
Crying myself out because i know this won't happen to me ~-~
I loved this so much. Very funny and enjoyable, but also incredibly informative as I struggle with social interactions and anxiety as well. 💟
The eyeshadow under virgil's eye change to purple when he's like in love! But since he's anxiety i'mma say he's nervous for a happy future kinda way?? But when the anxiety gets to him it turns black again! Am i getting this right? This detail is so cute tho!! The purple sparkles are a REALLy nice touch uwu
This was so cute I died! I have definitely been in this exact situation so many times, although there wasn’t really a happy ending for me tbh 😅
I’m not crying you are
This is so beautiful I'd love to see a live action recreation in the future!!
YESSSSSSSSS also! When i get access to my own money I AM JOINING YOUR PATREON :D
Also is it the lighting or does Virgil’s eyeshadow go purple when he’s feeling braver?
I loved this! It was so gorgeous!🥰 and I swear since it looks like Prinxiety is happening I’m waiting for Logicality to.🙏🏻
I CANT EVEN VNVCJVNDFFNVDVNJDV IT WAS TOO CUTE
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD ABOUT ABDILLUSTRATES IN THE VIDEO. But in all seriousness, I'm really happy you guys collaborated with all these artists, it's so cool and I love it. Thanks Thomas for giving me such a positive start for the day 💜💜
It it just me or was that just a whole  episode of thomas geting a date and prinxiety
while waiting for the next video i always wonder why i let myself wait this long and then i watch them and i’m in love with all of it all o we again
This was so cute!!!! I'd love to see more
That speech... oh my god... beautiful💜
I love this <3
Wait so you’re fine with the ships? THIS IS WHY IM SCARED OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD! anddd did this happen in real life!? Because EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Ok I’m good 😅
Bro this deep
Is the purple under eye only when he (Virgil) is happy? Then the rest of the time it’s black ? I can’t be the first not one who noticed the eye shadow difference right ?
Dude i waited so long for this and logan literally ISNT HERE
I can feel Logan and Paton's presents in the first 6 minutes. Logan is probably saying "statistically, he's probably not attracted to men" paton was probably saying "admitting your mistake is the right thing to do"
I loved it so much 🥰🥰🥰
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!!!! PLEASE MAKE A LIVE VERSION!!
WAAHH THE STIMMING MAKDE ME SO HAPPY BC I WAS DOING THAT TOO
I knew it he’s making Prinxiety exist
You know even though I’m straight I relate to this on a personal level
As Safely As Possible ASAP
Woahhhh when Virgil is in a good mood he becomes ADHD OwO (With PURPLE SPARKLY EYESHADOW I LOVE IT)
I love this so much XD
💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤
The entire time I kept screaming “MY HEART OH MY GOD” out loud. This is amazing and ADORABLE
THIS WAS SO CUTE
I do miss your *Animated* and characterizing facial expressions, but the artistry does such an amazing job. Thank you and your ...staff? Friends? Wonderous people? For another glowing Sanders Sides. Until next time. :)
This is glorious
oh my god this is awesome XD
YESSSSS SANDERS ASIDES
I relate to this sosososososoooooo much      Please send help...
The prinxiety fans are going crazy. I can hear them already
They're two halves of a whole idiot
Ngl. I really wanted to see Roman and virgil hug. At the end. And like finally get along
This is so cute
Oh man i want the animation show noooow
I can’t believe how Thomas is actually 31 already, he doesn’t look it at all!
HIS EYESHADOW KEEPS CHANGING!!!!! If you notice, when Virgl is happier/ less stressed, his eyeshadow turns purple!!! (Originally, it's black)
Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing with how he was feeling I- 🥺💔
Thomas, you are really fuckin good at scripts, the entire scene had me cackling with the comedic timing and "5 secs, go, pin, not gay, pin gay! gay!"
I love the "wait how long is too long" and abruptly virgil comes up with "6 secs, so you only have 5."
"UGHHH, Pintroverts!" -*Roman Sanders, 2020*
Virgil is baby
I kinda cried here because I know what it's like to suffer social anxiety like this
"Dude, that happens 30 times a day. *Please relax-*" "*DONT TELL ME TO RELAX.*"
Dude, I never knew why I liked pins and stickers, like yeah! To show what I like but I had never gone to deep into it and now I'm like "man... That makes sense" Also, why is everyone ignoring that Creep reference
I honestly ship Roman and Virgil
gay.
Awwww!      This was so cute!
I stan Nico and Thomas
Wait who is Janus?
The "gay eyes" had me rolling🤣 I love this so much haha
"join me!  No thinking" honestly same also this was absolutely amazing, the animation was so freaking good!  And the story was so cute!  Also Virgil looking so happy and excited was so adorable, seeing him come out of his shell is so cool, especially seeing you coming out of your shell as well!!!!
No-one: Not a single soul:   Thomas: I don't know... P l a n t
I-i got an sander sides ad before I could even get into the video.? How did they???
No one going to read into the fact that Roman said if he's making a mistake he's adding it to the list no one just me ok
Me: sees title  Also me: idk what it’s about but I. SHIP. IT!  Me once again seeing the end of the video: YAAASSSSSS
Gay eyes the universal language that all gays around the word speak
The fact Virgil eyeshadow/bags turn purple when hes happy/excited is so cute and i love it
Or an explanation of the gay panic process in 20 minutes
Do I sense a ship?
I got goosebumps wtf
Virgil is a whole ass mood
Please tell me I'm not the only one with perxity?
"IDK plant" 2020 quote of the year
excuse me as i go and cry now :')
Aww, look at princey and Virgil kinda working together ❤️ I so ship them! I really hope they get together in a future episode! I just find it so sweet that it was Virgil was the one who pushed Thomas to talk to the guy in the end. And the purple eyeshadow is so cool 👍🏻 Also it’s a nice detail that it changes color when he’s extra happy or feeling a certain feeling!
Does this mean we will see Nico more now?   Oh god, I cannot wait to see Remus's reaction to Nico and all of his suggestions that Thomas and Nico can do.
THE BLINK-182 REFERENCE IS PERFECT
What are you doing?   Idk, plant?   😂love that
This would make a great kid show. I feel like i would have benefited more from this as a kid.
"I'd hate to rain on your Black Parade! Gerard Gay" My fav new quote
EXCUSE ME, BRAVERY HUH
The purple eyeshadow was so good. I love it.
dkaflksdjflkj I love this so much!!!  the art ahhhh
The eyeshadow colour keeps changing.... is this a hint????? To something??????? 👀👀👀
if this doesn't sum up gay panic I don't know what does
6:29 why do they have five microphones XD
my little gay heart!!!!! oh my goodness so cute awesome
Me: I'm not crying Conscious: liar  Me: shut up conscious
This was so beautiful. 😭❤️
From the title I legit thought that this was going to be a Prinxiety thing lol.
This is why you never go to the mall without friends to back you up. They could've just approached the person in question for you to help ^^
Thomas: Nothin but a bruised ego Roman, offended: hmm- Virge getting the reference: pfft- Also anyone else choke at the prinxiety moment?
Omg I want Thomas to find his Nico 😢❤
I... got an ad for Thomas sanders... during this video...
REED, STOP BEING SO FRICKIN POOR SO YOU CAN JOIN THE PATREON AHHHHH-
DUDE I WAS SCREAM THE WHOLE TIME WTF
OK SO I JUST NOTICED VIRGIL HAS SPARKLY  EYE SHADOW WHEN HES HAPPY BUT IT TURNS BACK TO THE NORMAL DARK KIND!!!!!!
this is just too cute and funny to even exist lmao XD
AHHHHH I FELT THIIS.  This is pretty much how I met my current girlfriend. We met at a Target and I was wearing a pride mask and she ended up saying she liked it and walked away and we both spent a good 30 minutes trying to work up courage to talk to one another until she asked me what face moisturizer I recommended.
Seeing Roman being happy after that bruised arguement and Virgil coming out of the bag for a video and turning it into an animatic really made me happy. I have already screamed many times because on how cute Thomas and Nico and Roman and Virgil are together!! Made me seperate a bit from my heartbreak. I have repeated this many times!! I'm glad this existed. UwU
Thomas found love. So did virgil and roman. MY SHIP IS RISING PRINXIETY  FOR LIFE!!!!👑💕💜
I thought this was a prinxiety animatic
Is this gay..  I love your videos
**crys in too broke for patron**
I clicked this before bed, now I'm amped up, & acting like Thomas at the end of the video! That. Was. Great!
be still my small gay shipping heart
Am I the only one saw how Virgil's eye shadow changes depending on his mood? like not the depth bu the color. If he is excited in some way and happy, its purple! otherwise its black :)
OMG VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGING I LOVE IT OMG THIS IS TOO CUTE AND RELATABLE IM FREAKING OOUUUUTTTT
Awww omg its so cute
Did anyone else notice that Virgil's eyeshadow at the end kept swapping between black and purple? Maybe when it's purple it's him thinking more positivly? Idk, but an interesting detail regardless.
FINALLY
Wow Sanders I can believe your still up. Nice to see you again ✌🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
salt is very essential
YAYAYAYAYAY ITS BACK!!
damn the gay panic is real. Also this video made quarantine worth it. I think an animatic every now and then could be really fun, and I would love to see more of them
YAAAS IVE BEEN WAITING
Wait wait I beg the question is the guy real? Did our relatable gay savior find the one!!?
AHHHHH I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!  I love how Virgil's eyeshadow was a light purple when he was excited like the darkness is linked to his stress!  AHHH I LOVE THEM SOO MUCH!!!
AHHHHHHHH I FELT THIS ENTIE VIDEO ON ALL LEVELS BUT PHYSICAL AHHHHHHH
This video really said: *gay panic* without actually saying it
Starts at 2:29
Wait so do you have a boyfriend????!?!!! Or no cause your a single Pringle
"An X X X pert"  "Easy there tiger"  Me: pfft  😂😂
Why did Virgil's eyeliner changed twice tho? Is this a sign for the theorists?
I WOULD FUCKING KILL TO SEE THIS SHOW ANIMATED
THIS IS SO PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: Virgil My best friend: Roman My other best friend: Thomas
Did anyone else notice how virgil's eyeshadow was switching between purple and black depending on how excited he was?
What happened to them
Where Logan and dad
I didn't know pins and buttons were a sign of gay but it makes so much sense
THIS SOLVES ALL MY LIFE PROBLEMS PRINXIETY FOREVA!
"Gay eyes?" "Gay eyes." "What are gay eyes???" I'm not even gay, (aroace) but I KNEW what gay eyes were.
I don’t think Roman realizes that if Thomas is old then so is the other sides including him
Why is roman  so damn  cute i love him😃❤🥰
This is so adorable, I'm only halfway through and I can't stop grinning at it asdfghjkl But, on another note... This was beautiful. Such a touching story with lovely visuals, I'm left in tears. And I really think not only gay/bi people can relate with this, it presents so well how your brain acts in those moments of interacting with people, even if, of course, made to be more fantastical than reality... I am really, really grateful for this, from the bottom of my heart.
eeek gayness fills the air yass
this gave me so much anxiety it's crazy bUT IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! OMG THE LOVE STORY MADE MY HEART SMILE
I saw this in a comment  gay panic  sums up this video perfectly
Was i the only one crying...       yes ok well imma go watch this over and over....  Love this!!
I feel like Nico is going to be an important character for Character Thomas since it’s mentioned that this episode is apparently essential to the overall storyline. Maybe we’ll actually get to see the Orange Side because of Nico
Thank you very much I have more proof the Prinxiety is canon!
WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPY HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW AND IT CHANGES TO BLACK WHEN HE’S ANXOUIS HE LOOKED SO HAPPY AAAAHH-
YAAAAAS ANOTHER SANDER SIDES VIDEO YAAAAAAASSSS
*gay panic*
Am I the only one who heard Virgil do the voice-multiplying thing at the end after the dog scared him? Or are my headphones just acting up lol
Deceit is working overtime on this episode
"dont tell me to relax!" that my frekin soul this was brilliant
I NOT CRYING YOU ARE
13:00 “I’m bad at flirting” “Try practicing in the mirror“  “How you doing?” *I’m not interested* “But wha-“ *Get out! GET OuT*
LOVELYY❤️🏳️‍🌈
En este cap me sentí tan identificada que me moría de vergüenza cada minuto jejjeje
Yey you made my day better!!!!!!!! , just got home from school and i hade math for 2 hours. 😂 So am serious
IS PRINXIETY GONA HAPPEN- PLEASE TELL ME IT IS OH LOOORD WE ALL SAW THE BLUSH RIGHT? R I G H T ? ?
Please tell me this is at least a semi true and that Thomas actually is dating someone who writes songs
WHEN VIRGIL IS EXCITED HIS EYESHADOW GO PURPLE!!!!!!!!
Virgil’s eyeshadow when he’s happy: :0 baby has purple eye shadow and it’s not as dark Virgil’s eyeshadow as soon as he’s anxious:  Dark and brooding just like every other moment   Conclusion.....draw Virgil with purple eyeshadow when he’s overwhelmingly happy
Virgils purple eyeshadow is so cute! It also means HES HAPPY! The emo is becoming a less stressed guy TwT
I’m gonna cry. This is too cute
Yaaass he’s back
Virgil hated to see Thomas /and/ Roman upset- awww- ......          ship
The whole video be like: Gay panic
I Hate to Rain your Black Parade, Gerard Gay   Me: puts on eyeliner
This gave me second hand anxiety
DID THIS HAPPEND
we need to know if this really happened because if so, BEST REAL LIFE LOVE STORY EVER TO EXIST ON THIS PLANET
ASDF HEARTSTRINGS BEING PULLED WITHOUT MY CONSENT MR SANDERS . . . I shall allow it >:(
I was smiling so much after this! I was feeling a bit down and I heard about people talking about how amazing this video is, so I decided to take a look. I was astonished by the amount of quality in this video, not only by the animatic, but by the story and how the little pieces and details just came together at the end. I felt myself relate quite a bit with some of the fumbling and anxious moments and it made me laugh so much. I’m so happy to have found this!
When they where talking about lying did they mean lying to himself?
Finally became a patreon!!
just watching this made my anxiety go up, but I really loved it, amazing job
Yeah so i started crying bc this was so sweet and also i really relate to this topic right now and then the end card happened now im just feeling really called out and even more lost lol and relationships are a lot but i wish you the best Thomas (whether this is just scripted or based off irl)
"We don't know if he's not gay" god why do i relate so much
"Shut up emo"         -Roman, 2020
Notice Virgil's eyeshadow in the end,  that's all I'm gonna saaaaaayyyy
You know you've reached peak awkwardness when you have to keep pausing the video because you're embarrassed FOR Thomas😂
6:48 *I see what you did there Sanders-*
I'm sorry- I rewinded the video after Thomas said "we thank you from the bottom of our hearts" and what I heard was "fk you from the bottom of our hearts" and I died 😂😂😂
I’m so happy to see ABDillustrates as a part of a Thomas sanders video ☺️
gay panic
Has Thomas got a boyfriend?
Anyone notice how Roman said Fibuary instead of Febuary? :<
So holy hell I loved every second of that I AM SO PROUD OF YOU I'd sign up for your patreon in a milisecond if I wasn't very broke 💜💜💜
So I work at a pumpkin patch, and one day I was placed at a little straw jump for kids to play... in straw. A group had walked over and there kids were playing in the straw. One of them was wearing a hoodie and the patch Virgil shirt. I was pretty sure it was a Virgil shirt, so I kinda shouted (she was a bit away from where I was stationed) “hey! I like your shirt” the group looked at each other confused and I pointed right at her and said “you!”. She also had pink hair and I took a picture of her when she was at another area a big distance away so I could show it to my friend. Absolute gay panic
It's like cyber stalking but....real life  -virgil
I love that you referenced, Paramore's song. They are my favorite band of all time!!!!!!
Talking about the pins was going to be a great start.   "Hey, I was just looking around as I was eating and I couldn't help but notice your pins. I happen to like a lot of the things you have on there."
AAHHH PRINXIETY IS FORMING
I'm definitely utilizing the stickers and pins from here on out. It's suitable for talking without talking....
VIRGIL WANTING ROMAN TO BE HAPPY IS ALL THE FOOD MY SOUL NEEDS TODAY
At 1:45 you say "final form", but are you like a Pokemon? 😅😂 (Sorry for this joke, it's clearly stupid)
Hey Thomas can you please do the old vines like you used to i would love that I love them im not saying I dont like you anymore but I would like you to bring them back
VIRGILS EYESHADOW COLOR CHANGES WHEN HE FEELS HAPPY OH MY FHDGHFHDGNZ
I didn't know i wanted animated Sanders Sides until this moment. And now i want it soooo bad.
THOMAS I WAS SO WORRIED WHERE HAVE YOUVE BEEN IM A HUGE FAN
Apart from all the meme's can we say how this was lovely made
Honestly I'm not very sure what to love the art or the romance-  Edit: I have seemingly fallen inlove- with both-
So prinxiety is cannon now?
Okay. First. Love the video. Second. I want to join the patreon. Third. I'm broke.  Ya see my problem?
Roman: I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay  Me: *screaming internally*
Ahh I would kill to be friends with thomas
Virgil: n-no i Romen: shut up emo                    *virgil smile's*  me; Omg Yessss
Yeyyyy more sander sides while I'm doing school
Does anyone else notice Virgils color of eyeshadow is changing? It’s going from black to purple..wait does it change when he’s excited or actually feeling emotion??? That would be so cool! Like if you agree and reply if you have more theories on this😊
Now that was cute
CUTE!
I SQUEALED--
YES MORE . MORE SANDRE SIDE . i adore this series
this was an awesome video
I’ve been a fan of Thomas since Vine was alive, and after Vine ended I stopped following his socials, but after finding him reposted on my friend’s Instagram, I decided to revisit his content. Me a year ago was a genius.
So Thomas *IS* gay?
Roman: I'd hate 2 rain on ur black parade, Gerard Gay Me: *puts on black eyeshadow* WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY-
I definitely didn’t cry a little because it definitely didn’t hit too close
THIS IS SO CUTE AW
I MISSED THIS!!!
Why cant Virgil and Roman also fall in love like that. Come on, Prixiety is so going to happen! Also if any one has Facebook, join the Sanders Sides Roleplay group, it's really fun
THIS SEETHES OF GAY PANIC I LOVE IT SO MUCH
23:42 wow I love Virgil
JAJSKSJDJD MY LITTLE GAY HEART
This video was honestly perfectly timed. I just moved to college and I know LITERALLY no one here and my social anxiety has pushed it so far that I've been here over a month and have only talked to 2 people (i.e. my RA and a potential boss that turned me down)... I know I need to step out and make friends but it can just be so intimidating, but maybe I can do like what Thomas did and just give myself that push of bravery to make at least 1 friend...
I like the fact I got a thomas sanders pateron ad before the video started-
I love the story but I prefer seeing you as the characters verse sketches
I have so much serotonin after this 🥺🥺
Happy tres
do more animations!
I was laughing soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo hard lol
1. Are these a) your thoughts or are you b) talking out loud. 2. Because if your answer is b i dont think he would date you anyway because you seem insane.
I’ll be honest, I don’t watch Thomas much, if at all, but I was just passing by to support Erin (I watch her sister, Colliscool 😅) but I for SURE stayed for all the references 😂😂 “Sorry to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay~” had me in pieces!
“What are you doing?” “Idk plant?” I JUST— IT IS BETTER THAN ANY EXCUSE I HAVE EVER MADE SO I CAN’T JUDGE BUT:/
I felt this on a personal level. I have a crush on this girl in class and we talk and joke sometimes but I just can't figure out if she's gay, so wish me luck folks. I'm probably gonna crawl in a trashcan while trying to figure out what sexuality she has like Thomas did.
THIS IS TOO CUTE I'M GOING TO DIE
I cried so fucking much its adorable
Annnnddd this is what we call a gay panic
I literally found my gay side fan-girling so hard towards the end and I am not sorry for almost squealing too
I just noticed when virgil is optimistic his eyeshadow will turn purple.
That moment when you have so much anxiety you have to hide in the comments when you feel like something embarrassing is going to happen😅 why am I this way? XD.
AHHHH THIS WAS SO CUTE!!! Also this will help my anxious gay ass
Also, are we not talking about Roman saying he’ll add it to the list when Virgil said he was making a mistake Poor babe;;;
Prinxiety!!!! Omg!!!!
Pintrovert is my new favorite kind of person
now this, THIS is good writing
i just got the deceit ad,,,, on a TS video
Okay more importantly what is their ship name? Tico? Nhomas? Food court sweethearts?
oh my god the eYESHADOW BECOMING PURPLE WITH A FORESHADOWY LINE
This whole video was adorable but the endcard scene was the CUTEST thing ahhh
THOMAS IS BACK ON MY RECOMMENDATIONS YAYYY
*vibrates intensely* oh my god they’re  in love ;0;
Pray- Jesus Christ I repent of my sins please come into my life and be my Lord and savior Amen! If you said this prayer I recommend that you get baptized 🛁🛀🛁🕊
*thomas unintentionally doing shadow work in a mall bathroom*  Literally everyone else in that bathroom: Wut?
Omg, I knew I knew the art style in the thumbnail. Omg!! Haha
Jacksepticye is rolling in his studio. “Top a the morning to ya- ignore that part”
HYPERVENTILATING
SOBBING
STARTS CRYING
This really hits close to home
GERARD GAY OH MY GODS🤣🤣🤣

Can u make a life action version
The purple eyeshadow 🥺
thomas making me angry at 14:38 LIKE BOI JUST GO WITH IT
its like a movie
Pwetty purple eye makeup!!! And I love the animatic, everybody did so well!
This is incredibly amazing
19:35 is that prinxiety!!!!!
Sangwoo?
the prinxiety- btw, this a video with bromance without a b- don't ask y, btw, Virgil is mah favorite character- edit: btw, its nice top see Princey and Virge getting along :)
Sorry to rain  Your black parade Gerard gay I have never had a sentence Sum up my middle school existence so completely
This was AMAZING! Absolutely gorgeous artwork, a really well paced story with so many funny and feels parts, and the romantic part was SO CUTE!
This video is so beautiful and i love it so much but like off topic but ur 30??! IDK WHY BUT I THOUGHT U WERE 25 NDHSKCRKJEYXKWCL I AM SO LATE
flirting with virgil? Yes please except he's gay and i'm in  relationship- iwefuhifuky tho prinxiety is yASSSSSS edit: i thought the sides were going to firt with virgil
HE FEAR THINGS TOO?! - Virgil yes honey we all fear something
I love the eyeshadow change when Virgil gets anxious!!
Oml did no one notice virgil's eyeshadow changes with his mood? Or is it just me?
I JUST FINISHED IT AND IM FUCKING CRYING  I WASN’T EXPECTING THIS TO BE SO CUTE
*I don’t know, plaant*
You should make a video of Patton really sad and have that the whole focus. Because if you think about it he is probably more sensitive than the other's, therefore, gets sad quicker.
ROMAN X VIRGIL
Gay staring!!!!!! 😅😂😂😂😂
Virgils eyeshadow is purple and shiny in the post credits thingo!!! What does that mean? Lol.  It’s switches during it too
QwQ omg I wuv dis!!!! ❤💜❤💜❤❤❤💜
Please, do make a comic-strip out of this! Anything! Just loved it 🥰😍😱
I have to say, that when I first saw the title and the thumbnail, I thought Thomas or (most likely) Roman was going to be flirting with a new side that represents Thomas' social anxiety aka Virgil.
You are not what you think. That's a lesson I always learn from Thomas' videos. His emotions affect him yes, but he isn't his emotions. He isn't what he thinks. That's something I tell myself when i'm feeling down.
Not what I was expecting but I still love it
omg i love it to much
So? is no one going to talk about virgil's eyeshadow????
Getting anxiety to relax is like telling a shark to go vegan. It clashes with their nature
Holy shoot I'm late but this made me cry like almost every video you make 🤧 I am a crybaby so it isn't a surprise I love your videos ❤️
THE SHIP IS SAILING! PRINXIETY IS SAILING AGAIN!
Ughhhh! finally! the whole video is like: just talked to him!! and now I'm so happy! I mean like I'm genuinely smiling hard😆
5:18 -where you can always find me and we'll have halloween on christmas
OMG THIS WAS AMAZING
War of the mind, the mind war of every introverted person
Why is nobody talking about how in the endcard scene Virgil's eyeshadow was bright purple when fangirling over the new guy and black when being anxious again? New character trait?
Can we just acknowledge that it is almost the sander sides series 4 year anniversary Edit: It's on Oct 19 to be exact
"LA Lakers and Balls"
Virgil's eye shadow changing at the end is just chef's kiss
That was so cute!!!
Claps alot* YAYYYY HAPPY STORY I CRINGE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT SO CUTE
wow my heart :'0 <3
Next video: Meet my boyfriend
Question for those who study Sanders Sides: Is there any significance to glittery purple vs smudgy black under Virgil's eyes? I just noticed lots of switching back and forth this episode that I haven't noticed before (I may have simply been oblivious to it) and details sometimes mean a lot so better to ask than miss out, right? Not saying a bad job was done if it was an accident (which seems unlikely), just curious!
“Gay or nay” Sounds like a gay dating show.
The gay stare to check if they gay or nay lmaooooooooooooo
Wow. it's an awesome animation. thanks for sharing it <3
GERARD GAY I *CANT*
wait is the eye shadow or undershadow xD for virgil new? or am i missing something? it was purple when he was happy
so your dating someone if so congrats
PRINXIETY IS REAL YES YES YES YES YES PLSSSSS MAKE A VID WHERE THEY CONFESS THEY LIKE EACH OTHER BECAUSE IM A HUGE SHIPPER EEEEEEEEEEEK
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME CRY LIKE THIS, DUDE
Virgil go; *panik* Thomas gO
V: You can live like Jack and Sally if yoh want.  Me: AND WE'LL HAVE HALLOWEEN ON CHRISTMAS, AND IN THE NIGHT WE'LL WISH THIS WILL NEVER END, WISH THIS WILL NEVER END. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON ME YOU'RE ALREADY THE VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD
'I dunno PLANTS'
"hes got stickers on his laptop"  "t h a t s  p r e t t y  g a y"
*AAAAAA* *YESSSSSSSS* *I LOVE ITTT*
I am crying. God this was so.. so enjoyable and beautiful and relatable and just.. Gosh I love Sander Sides so much and this whole thing is just perfect ❤
12:46 someone get patton he is thomases heart
Okay, the purple eyeshadow, the possible prinxiety moment, that may have also had hints of unsympathetic Roman and Virgil, the chances of the Orange Side popping up soon. The theories. They're endless.
Roman: No, it’s Roman. With an R? Geez, you really are struggling today  Virgil: *thinking* I won’t slap him in the face with a chair, I won’t slap him in the face with a chair...
for the first half i was like  '' omg i- ksnsbsksbsjsjshsj '' but then the second half came   and i was just like '' OMG I- KSNSBSKSBSJSJSHSJ♡♡♡ ''  this was so cute and made me feel alot of emotions cuz i can heavily relate to it. thankyou so much for this episode thomas^^♡  (edit: AHHHHHH THE END CARD OMGGG SAME!)
I like how in the end, when he was happy, his eyeshadow was purple with glitter, but when he was worried , he was black eyeshadowed. Seems very interesting.  Very interesting indeed.....
i love this
Is your Father’s name Adam?
prinxiety are working together
I've just really got to say I LOVED this video - maybe because it hit too close to home 😅 but it was amazing 👏 💖
Roman: SHSHDJ- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!  Thomas: I-I duNno,,,,pLanT..?
I only have one thing to say that, that was a good episode i loved it
I was getting second hand embarrassment and cringing. Not from the pin stalking. Not from the trash can. Not the stranger or the bathroom. But from Thomas walking up to the guy. Virgil pushing him away was a relief. I just cannot handle talking to a gay in the wild. Probably why all my relationships are from dating sites or work. Approaching a stranger in person, someone you'd have no gage of their interest in you..... I just cannot imagine doing anything even remotely like that. I'm so jealous of people that can just walk up and have conversations like that.
I'd just like to say I'm sorry that vine was deleted :(( but I love u anyway <3
and with is where the shipping on anxiety and roman begins.... ONLY IN MY HEART THOUGH SO SHUSH-
Okay but- VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYELINER AND EYE SHADDOW???? I stan
this needs to be a animated series!!!!!!!!! TTATT
mMMM I JUST- VIRGIL LOOKING BACK AT THOMAS AND ROMAN AND FEELING SAD JUST- AND GAINING COURAGE IS SO CUTE AND AMAZING AND THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
Thomas : simping over a cute guy  Also Thomash : He's probably better off without me  Cute guy : Approaches Thomas  Prince and Anxiety : *PANIC*
I NEED A LIVE ACTION!!!!
Did anyone else notice how when anxiety was happy his eye shadow was a sparkly purple, but when he got upset it went back to the normal black????
This was so cute and dorky omg-
I THREW MY PHONE AT 17:17 OMG VIRGIL PLZ I LOVE U
. . .This...is..so.......deep.
Yet another person to remind of the darkness that is my life and the fact of being in my 20s but being no where near where I want to be in my life. Broken and battered like a forgotten dream. like a kid with no imagination
Prinxiety!😍😍 oh I love this Video! It’s so gorgeous🥰
Virgil: No Roman: No you no!
I can’t believe I got an ad for thomas’ patreon AFTER the promo in the actual video. The ad is immaculate Thomas
I SENSED TENSION AND CAME AS FAST AS I COULD
"Pintroverts"
So your going to look at me and tell me princey X Emo nightmare  is canon
You're crying stfu
AND VIRGIL'S EXCITED PURPLE EYESHADOW GIVES ME LIFEEEEEEEE !!!!!
I love how at the end when Virgil gets excited/kinda happy the bags under his eyes are purple but then they go back to black again when he goes back to having anxiety. Nice touch there!
So some people ship Roman x Virgil... Should we call it... Self Love?
WE NEED A LIVE ACTION VERSION OF THISSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is my life when I’m trying to flirt🙈🙈🙈🙈
I'm sorry but how can you see the ending and not ship prinxiety?!
I'm not gay, but this could be gayer.
Straight person: what even is a 'gay panic'? I don't understand.  Me: *the whole video*  Straight person: Understandable, have a nice day
This makes me super happy
Thomas: "I to tend to waste a lot of opportunities in life" Niko: "Well.. Lets not waste this one" Roman: "shut up-" Virgil: "shut up-" Roman: "sHuT Up" Me: *freaking out because that scene was the best-* Also me: *rewatching this part on repeat cuz its SO CUTE*
Aw, Virgil´s doing everything for his friends...
The bloopers :(
I'm watching this after I *gay* panicked and asked someone out to a (virtual) picnic- this hitting a lil too close to home right now- i still cant breathe 😃 but its good cant breathe- i also dont exist now-  They said yes so :) gn
Never had I screamed at my screen more once the end of the animatic came around. Thanks to the artists, this was insanely good! 🖤
This was so cute!! Ahh!! Such a great job to the artist team and the writers! So cute!
"That dang dog!"   *As my dog is barking outside-*
I loved how happy virgil’s eyeshadow was purple. But I’m not sure how I feel about him become the opposite of anxiety. He is anxiety. At least with me my anxiety would keep me held back and I’d just cry about it later. Anxiety wouldn’t make me push myself to talk to someone. I feel like his opposite (bravery or confidence, sort of how like there’s Patton/Janus, and Roman/Remus) would have instead taken strength and pushed you instead of Virgil. Virgil is anxiety. Like instead of virgils arms pushing you, it’s like a similar jacket, but instead of the black/purple it’s..... ah... (trying to think of a colour you’re not using......) white/pink or something and those sleeves is all we see, next frame he’s gone. That’s it. Virgil’s momentarily lapse in anxious judgement gave his opposite the opportunity to react... Idk... i know it’s real life for you and OMG my heart! I’m so happy for you! I’m just thinking of the story front and character consistency. Anxiety doesn’t stop being anxiety just because you’re sad about a missed opportunity.   It could even work if Roman didn’t notice who pushed You and still thanks Virgil. Except now Virgils nervous because he knows the truth
somehow this video GAVE me anxiety
15:32 STOP ATTACKING ME I-
Me during the speech: CUTEEEEEEE After the guy comes out: awsss He needs love too
roman: shut up emo me: okay first of all ow, second... cOngrAtUlATe mY AkWArd clOsEtEd bI bEhInD I hAVe A gIRlfrIenD
yes prinxiety my favorite ship and Thomas finally a new ship for u and that dude wonderful even if it wasnt real!
The way this made me cry when he just talked about going to the mall and talking to a stranger BYE   Edit: The way this was happier than anything that happens to me. I would’ve deadass ended it with the person I liked walking away.
I- I haven’t even watch the video but it is inside anything that I’m familiar with it he’ll be gone before they even get a chance to talk to
I like how at the end, Virgil’s eyeshadow switched between sparkly purple (when he was excited) and black (after hearing Thomas’s subtweet, and after Thomas asked if he was ready)
I commented this on "Putting Others First" and it is the only idea about the show and its characters that I've really ever felt passionate about. I can't afford a Patreon right now, so I offer this idea to anyone that also loves it and can get it to the creators for me.   This is an exact copy and paste from my reply to Bright Eyes on their color theory of a possible orange side.  "Love your last theory about humanity. Honestly the one thing I noticed is that there is two blues (morality and logic). I'm a psychology student, and one of the interesting things that I loved about this video is the language. When we are children we develop a faulty logic, where be believe we have no choice when it comes to our well being and that somehow we can change the emotions of others. We learn that our actions have consequences and begin to develop foresight but not fully master it. This leads to a lot of language use like "I have to..." in regards to relationships, when actually our interactions are a choice. A child might think they have to get good grades to make their mother happy and that is their motivation, but an adult realizes that they choose to get good grades because it leaves themselves feeling more fulfilled and in the process makes their mother happy. Adults learn that they cannot control someone else's emotions through actions. Learning that all you can to is control how you respond is a hard life lesson.   What I would love to see is Patton evolving to Orange his color compliment as he learns that emotional intelligence isn't reliant on foresight and built in 'sharp' boxes of good or bad (logic, blue). Watching Patton tap into the passionate intensities of emotions (red, raw emotions) and finding confidence to be okay with the unknown reason for his decisions (yellow, intuition and empathy) would be so beautiful to me."   Thanks a million for reading. I love Sander's Sides and when I'm better off financially you better bet I will be a Gross Profit Member!
I cackled every TEN SECONDS  The way I understood EVERY JOKE
Honestly if this was an animated series I’d be living for ts
I loved this episode so much! The end was so wholesome! And cute! It really made my day! ☺️
Ok, but is anyone else crying with love over this video or is it just me???
You know I don't know if it's a joke or if it's true if Thomas is gay or not because he's making these jokes now we just made this entire video about it so it's 50/50
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww :DDDD
Is nobody gonna talk about the title saying sanders asides
COUGH •WISHING THIS WAS A TRUE STORY BE LIKE•
Awe I love the ending how they just look at Thomas with such pride and happiness😊😄
I just love the fact that there’s a miniature castle at the back and also I love this vid! It was amazing!!!
Even Thomas ships Prinxiety
I love how when virgil got enthusiastic his eyeshadow got brighter. Cool symbolism
*me panicking about the whole vid*
"The only logical next step, go home and regret everything" very valuable lesson learned
that was A R T
I lowkey cried....idk why but i did
3rd comment - Can we pls have a episode where the sides may turn to... Humans, and... Idk meet irl people and communicate.  Also, Virgil, Ily. Ur a good person for Thomas
I don’t know if you will see this but I think it will be funny if Deiceit ducked out and you say you have eaten all of Logan’s crofters 😅😂😂
I like how Emo's eye bags changing with his mood
Why was this so beautiful to me, the end made me so happy
17:06  ALSO DOES THIS MEAN THOMAS HAS A BOYFRIEND  👀👀👀👀
Nobody: Absaloutely nobody: The Prinxiety shippers: *squeal* Me: :) can they just get together now?!
I love???? Virgil’s makeup changing when he’s feeling a positive kind of anxiety??? I don’t know if the change between shimmery purple and all black was a goof or intentional but it seemed to me like the shimmery purple was to emphasize the adrenaline-like feeling after an exciting positive interaction and the all black was when more negative thoughts seemed to creep back in. I’d love to see that return if you do an episode on like, how anxiety/adrenaline can be useful to keep your energy high for something like auditions. Loved the episode, the concept was amazing and the art was adorable!
Omg i love this beyond compare
This was some damn wholesome goodness
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay" I'm scREAMING
Hello I’m back
*screams in gay* I LOVE U THOMAS! *looks at the sides* :) you guys too!
:0
“You’re going to have to try... speaking from the heart” Me: oh is Patton coming in? No? Okay
Duuuude. Thomas deserves an adorable romantic meeting like that. I hope you find your Prince charming if you haven't already
tHIs IS SO CUTE!!!! I wish I had as much courage to walk up to someone I like and talk to them ;^;
“I don’t want me to be doing this either.”   Me most of the time.
This is adorable and extremely relatable. 💕
Glad you are doing good Thomas keep up the good work
Who else wants to collaborate with Thomas but is ti young and lives far away-
Honestly.... Virgil and Roman going back and forth while Nico was first talking is what goes through my mind while talking to literally any guy who’s trying to make actual conversation with me....
Ahh this made me so happyyyy
hey that's pretty gay
*vid comes out* me: *fangirling and laughing at the smallest things*
Is anybody else wondering if this really happened?? 🤔💭❤
This "hit a little too close to home" lol
I love the Virgil is becoming more than just Anxiety. I feel like he's also excitement too. I can't wait to see more purple eyeshadow Virgil in the future!!
OMG THAT WAS SO CUTE IM CRYING 😭 I relate so much to that 😂
Thomas was being impersonated the whole time
🥺💕
Roman: shut up emo (heart's apear*) me: UM EXCUSES ME WHO WHERE THOSE INTENDED FOR?!?!? In my head: eather my ship is sailing or I'ma look real stupid on the internet.
For once, I don’t think this could have been gayer, I love it ;-;
Is Virgil secretly Courage? And has been manifesting as the lack thereof, making him Anxiety? So, as Thomas gets better at dealing with and overcoming his anxiety, Virgil can express Courage more often.... probably overthinking. Cool thought though, in my opinion!
Who else was literally sweating and felt this in their soul?
"Little PUNK"
THIS IS THE CUTEST AND BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNN
I am extremely attracted to this man
Hi, I'm sorry to ask this again, but can you please have a sander sides video talking about depression please?
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL’S CHANGING MAKEUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG IT’S SO PRETTY WTFFF WHATS HAPPENING?!?!?!?!?!?
Did anyone else notice Virgils eyeshadow changing at the end and was low key confused af
16:08 pffftttttt
I only have one thing to say about this...                            ...I ship it...
This animation hit me on such a deep and personal level, I was literally in tears by the end.
"I didn't want to ruin the moment.." "Ya..I gotta stop wooing strangers in the bathroom"
This hit so close to home for me. Good Job as always Sanders👍🏾
Tomas I swear he probably KNOWS who you are, man. Like bro he's GAY he's into DISNEY he is 100% probably a fan of yours
At the end, that change of color in the makeup under Virgil's eyes...I love that something so subtle can help highlight the changes in emotion
Awh the end almost made me cry Thomas seems like such a genuine human being, thank you for making this thomas, and all of the other sander sides. I think you provide really important information that had helped a lot of people out <3
i was in a call when i was watching this.....         the whole video i was smiling like an idiot
Finally a new one!
Oml this was adorable, wholesome, and such an accurate representation of gay panic 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
The only thing I want on patreon is the scripts, those would be so fun to do, hopefully I can do it soon
"I hate to rain on your Parade Gerard GAY" hahahahahahahaha
Omg I love this
...... Now I remember why I'm not the biggest princy fan
18:18 ohmygod I feel the gay panic rising in me.    19:40 AAaAAAAAAAAaaaaH
Is it just me...or did you guys see Virgil's eyes shadow change form either purple or black?
That was so adorable. X3
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
AW VIRGIL WANTED TO SEE ROMAN HAPPY SO HE PUSHED THOMAS FORWARD
Lol it’s just two sides the entire time ship those sides
This was so cute. I loved the story and how you told it
Omgomgomg. I'm getting a job soon. And you know what that means 😏😏. I CAN GET THOMAS MERCH AND SUCH🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳
You better not make me cry over this animatic :(((
anyone else notice our emo boys under eye shadow changing between black and shiny purple in the end? normally its light black and or dark grey but it was switching between super dark black and shiny light purple.
Two things. One, this seems like the origin story of Roman and Virgil’s feelings about Janus?? 🤔 Second: MY HEART CANNOT HANDLE ALL OF THIS PRINXIETY
My heart melted
Sampler side. I love it!
God i wish I had the money to join the patreon....
no one: not a single soul: thomas thinking to himself: hey yknow what’s a good idea? whole video, gay panic. go.  roman: perfect-
There are two types of people, people who love Sanders Sides,   And people who haven’t heard of it yet
LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT.
Yay! I love you Virgil
I love Virgil's purple and sparkly eyemakeup! That's so cute!
I missed this so much
Virgil had purple eyeshadow and was squealing like a girl when they talk to their crush!! Awwww!!! That's so cute. 💜💜
Roman: I hate to rain on your Black Parade Gerard Gay- Me:*slams fist against table* I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT-
THAT WAS ADORABLE OH MY GOSH THOMAS!!!!!!! I'm sending this to my best friend and making her watch this! This does hit really close to home though! I often have trouble speaking up and all I can manage is a small shy wave at a cute girl, I'm a mess and by the time I go to get a word out they're gone. Such a cute animation though!!!
“He’s in his thirties, he might as well be sixty” 🤣🤣🤣
the BL drama i needed
I loved this! It was amazing! I can't wait to see the finished product!
That hits way to close to home! I love that way to much!
I really need to work on not feeling second hand embarrassment as much. Literally I will pause a show and do smth else when smth embarrassing happened to a main character. This episode took me days.
IS PRINXIETY CANNON
6:48 Roman: now I am telling that you look like a freak  Thomas for the entire video: *talking with Virgil and Roman*
*The prinxiety is strong in this one*
Please tell me you have a boyfriend that would be so cute and Nico Aaaaaa the Percy Jackson Fandom is going crazy right now
Okay but the Prinxiety vibe is amazing.
Today I just realised your gay how did I not know that I am the biggest idiot in the world Wtf I have been watching your videos for years yet I’m like “he that’s pretend”      I AM SO STUPID SOMEONE KILL ME AND FORGIVE MY SINS
omg i just noticed this but at 22:54 and 23:00 Virgil’s eyes go from purple to black the little details is amazing
HOLD UP    Is Virgils makeup purple for a bit in some of the clips...?
Im still happy that we finally got Janice's name can someone please confirm that i spelled it right i know it was shown in the video i cant read curly/bubble/pretty writing
How proud Roman is at the end is so adorable!
‘It’s okay, it happens thirty times a day’ loved how that kept repeating throughout the episode!
i’m living for that blink-182 reference rn
At first I thought this was a fan thing but no. Thomas seriously said "let's flirt with Virgil"
There right there look at that tan well tended skin, look at the killer shape he’s in, look at that slightly stubbly chin oh please he’s gay totally gay!
Netflix anime whoo? But seriously shoot this idea to netflix
*loud inhale*  *CHRONIC CUTENESS SCREECHING*
that dude just needs to listen to burning pile 🙄✋🏻
I love these animations!! And some many lines from this video are a big MOOD!! I love at the end when we see Virgil's new eyeshadow! Also, when Virgil got startled by the dog and screams "Aaah! Demon!" I died of laughter!!
Our child virgil is back
YES THOMAS!!!
thomas are you ok those eye circles are intense
This is literally me, trying to make friends in college... 😂💕😂
Virgil smiling so much at the end!!!! 😁😁😁
This made me so happy I cried omg and also was WAY TOO RELATABLE
Me: ... Prinxiety shippers: OMG YESSSS!!!!  Also me: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!! YES YES AND YESSSSSSS!!!!!
shut up i justs finished watching this it’s so cute i’m gonna cry
✨GAY✨
AWW roman x Virgil is cannon
Omgggggg am I the only one bursting at the seams watching the gay panic
WHEJJEKENSNWJWKENENSJDKENJSSJE WHAT I LOVE THIS SO FREAKING MUCH
My own anxiety was through the roof. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT VIRGIL EYESHADOW!?
"A disny fan, oh ok i can see the love tonight!"
“Shut up emo”  That hit hard-
Nice he's back with more amazing shipping choses
(●__●)...  Y e s
EMO GAY PANIC YESSSSS
This is the longest animatic I’ve ever seen so far, and I love it.
I'm extremely sorry for all the negativity about sexuality, my parents, for example, are a bit weirded out by it, so if I ever came out as anything, I'd probably tell my friend first. So, I wish you the strength of every gay, lesbian, bi, etc person in the world. Whenever you have to deal with a jerk who is against your sexuality. I'm with you 100%
Did you ever think when you started out on Vine you would be where you are today?
i don’t know....plant :3
"Cutie at 12'o clock" is the best thing ever and I will now use this XD
I remind me as the host from the total drama island ಥ╭╮ಥ
Fave moments 4:33 5:35 6:27-6:53 7:42 9:00 9:17 10:43 12:29 12:47-14:17 15:27 16:08 17:15 19:31 19:38-20:00
Our final form ⁽⁽ଘ( ˊᵕˋ )ଓ⁾⁾
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC
I probably shouldn't watch this after I got my heart absolutely crushed today. It hits a little close.
I SAW A MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!!!
VIRGIL!
I've missed a lot, who's Janus?
Ok I absolutely love that subtle change with Virgil's eye makeup being dark when he's anxious and purple when he's excited
Did Virgil get new eyeliner and also it’s very weird seeing Virgil smile
I AM FEELING EMOTIONS! 😭😭😭😭
Hello lgbtq community
That was awsome
The eyeshadow change! The eyeshadow change! Where are the theories and replies for me to read for hours?( Also Virgil and Roman being happy together makes me  happy)
This video made me relly anxious for some reason 😂
as a socially awkward bi transguy I have these issues plus a pile of others.
I knew he was gay
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PRINCIEXITY
WAIT, THOMAS IS IN HIS 30s?! I THOUGHT HE WAS LIKE... 25?!?!
this is me like 99.99 percent
Omg this episode was amazing!
B o i l e d   C a r r o t s
AHH AHSBJSNSBDHSN I LOVE IT AHHHHH AHDBSBNSKDKDODBDHIEBDBHDD I'M HAVING SUCH A GAY MOMENT OML
YAY
I just choked when I saw my dnd go to artist in this vid and screamed. I went into fangirl mode I'm so sorry. Also, HOLY SH_T THAT'S OVER 20 MINUTES OF ANIMATE!
I’m dying of cuteness!!!!!
oh my god this is the cutest thing everrrrrrrrrr
You should have the sanders sides react to animation memes
You should post on for Nebula.
Is no one going to talk about Virgil's under eyeshadow changed from purple to black when his mood changed?
Anyone else think that prinxiety played a role today, that ending was very gay (it's 5.20 am I can't English rn)
So beautiful 🥺
THUS MADE ME SHIP THEM EVEN MORE!
OMG I LOVE THIS!!! Partially because of the happy ending, and partially because I can relate to the social anxiety kind of feeling, only I think I'm just really good at hiding mine...? Idk. Anyways, keep up the amazing work Thomas!
prinxiety at its finest
gatekeeping content. mmm, my favorite
I laughed way too hard at "NO MAN!" "It's RO-Man, with an R!"
Yaaaaay your still doing this
I just got an ad for Janus’s Corridor of Stored Rewards right before the bathroom speech, I was so thrown off
I think Virgil and Roman are the perfect example of foils I've ever seen.
I need this irl XD
omg omg omg OH. MY. GOD.      Is virgil representing gay panic? (also that purple eye shadow for when he's having a good time is amazing-)
ABD!!
Prinxiety shippers(like me) are having a field day.
*gay panic*
Omg so cute I’m ded
10:44 “I-I dunno.. plant.” Absolutely priceless
nice radiohead reference at 6:49!
"Speak from the heart" DUN DUN DUN!!!
“perfume sample?” “uhhhh no thanks i’m not- uh- stinky!”  “liar.”
Can I just say if this ever does get filmed live-action at all mall and Virgil DOESN'T comment on them being dressed funny at a mall I'm going to McLose it
Is no one gonna talk about Virgil’s light purple eyeshades? Just me?     ok, but ngl, it’s cute on him
AAAAAA I’M FANGIRLING ABOUT THE PART WHERE THOMAS TALKED TO THE OTHER!
This entire video is just watching gay panic
honestly this is just the absolute cutest oh my freaking god jesus i love it
Gay panic personified into a video.
V..Virgils eyeshadow gets brighter when he's excited?!?!?!?! That is so adorable!!!!
So, character development atm from my perspective. Thomas: Working on himself. Vergil: Learning to be brave and letting Thomas take scary opportunities. Logan: Feeling like none of the sides care about him and not liking that he feels at all. Roman: Feeling like no one listens to him as is frustrated about it. Patton: trying to be less strict on Thomas.  Janus: Getting accepted as a valid voice in Thomas's conflicts and maybe trying to be less evil? Remus: Living his best life by being a chaotic evil boi.
I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay  which one of you wrote that because that's genius
Ahh demon!!  😂😂😂
Roman- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Thomas- Uh donno....plant?  WHY DID THIS MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD?
Pls make an animatic where your different  types of sander sides reacting to their ships btw Thomas I love ur vids
I loved this it was cute
Did nobody see virgil's makeup change from black to purple
“Shut up emo” WHSJWJSJW I LOVE IT
AAAAAWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!
This would be amazing to see in live action
Dude this is hecking cute
LGBT youth here, I had no idea that this is what will be going into dating. I suppose I didn’t even think about the fact that the first question has to be “Are they also LGBT?” The video hit all the right notes story wise, but the idea that that is what will be happening is... thought provoking.
THAT WAS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN THE FEELS THE EMOTION I DON'T THINK I BLINKED ONCE AHHH That is all. Have a lovely day.
I love how they have THREE different microphones when Thomas is trying to get a closer look at the backpack
this is so cute omg
Omg this is beautifulllllll!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi, I'm crying
Seeing Virgil all happy was the most Wholesome Thing Ever I’m gonna CRY
Ok, two things: 1st, I would die for Nico. 2nd, I didn’t really like the Prinxiety ship to be honest, but it was small and well executed in this video. Honestly, I don’t think I mind it! Cute!
This may help me to talk to a guy I think is cute who I see every week but never talk to because there’s a big room with lots of people... he sits in front of me at church but I still don’t have the nerve to talk to him.. I literally stood next to him when talking with a few friends and still couldn’t have the nerve to strike up a conversation. Random stranger who listened to my problems, thanks :)
ugh, i want someone to approach me the way Thomas approached Nico-
C U T E S T thing EVER
*Cries in shipper* also this was awesome
Pintrovert
It hurts because it’s literally me
That’s gay🌝✨
Its the middle of the night si I have no sound but you had me at the title, I'm happy
Aghhaaoaossosj the second hand embarrassment
Finally!!!
Virgil's undereyeshadow was everything.  <3
Incoherent screaming*
Omg THIS IS SOOOO CUTE
Anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow at the end and how it changed to black for one scene and went back to the purple version???
BOLD OF YOU TO ASSUME I ONLY LIKE ONE GENDER  *tilts hat* *pulls out bi card*  Its time to d-d-duel
I’m so happy there is a new video!
Am i the only on seeing tension between virgil and Roman its obvious they like each other but,virgil tries to push him away if i was his sister i would beat the crap out of him but i lovvvvve virgil even though he is insecure we love you plzzz make a video about this comment i mean im not forcing you to but i would be so happy even though i am always happy watching your videos also tell every side but dont let virgl hear i said "if you break his heart i will make you never see the suns light again" Love you guys well thomas~
I'm going to go cry now. Thank you.
This is so wholesome
This is so cute. This made my day
okay but like- doing phonecalls with social anxiety is the ʷᵒʳˢᵗ
This is so friggin wholesome 😭🥺
When Virgil is me
i want those perks but i’m POOR
I cant, the cuteness, so beautiful!!!
WHAT are you doing? ... I dont know... pLaNt???
Roman: next step is we talk to him Virgil and me at the same time: Noooo
soooo cuteee!!! worth all the ads that interrupted it. Plus i know ads are good revenue, but still worth it
that Virgil eyeshadow at the end there tho
OKAY BUT THE EFFECT WITH VIRGILS EYESHADOW AT THE END?????? IT TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY/EXCITED???????
You should watch Kipo
YESSSSSSS!!!!!
AAHH!! I felt the gay paniccc!!! AAh! im  dying ahhhh 😨😨😨😨🥵🥵😱😰 im soo.. oml
g e r a r d  g a y
Man I’m a pin-trovert and I feel represented.
I'm subscribed and I had to search for it! WTF, YouTube?
“i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay”  HELP I LOVE IT
“Huh. Delete it.” Had me rolling
*"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay."* _- Roman Sanders, 2020_
This was amazing
13:57     what's going on with that reflection?
I'm definitely a pintrovert
“... BUT WE STILL DONT KNOW IF HE’S GAY!”   I felt this in my soul...  (Edit: Oh wow. Most likes ever. Should I be proud that it was about Gay Panic TM?)
This so cute 🥺🥺🥺
GO THOMAS GO GET THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE WHILE ROMAN AND I PLAN THE WEDDING!
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW IS BRIGHT PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY AND THATS SO CUTE
I love this! 😂😂😂😂 Thomas always brightens my day and honestly Virgil is my fav.
"Top of the morning to ya" Me: no it's TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA! MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE...
I can feel the anxiety leaking out of the screen and I can relate to these situations 😅
I really love this video. I always have a hard time talking to guys I have interest in. On top of that not knowing what to say after the first contact. Very touching and hits close to home. Keep up the good work.
I LOVE THE END OF TGE ANIMATIC
17:18 wow that push from Virgil really got me! The way he saw how the others were disappointed that they were too anxious to go and talk to the guy. He saw how his power over the others was hurting so that they couldn't go up and talk to the guy! Wow this episode made me feel so, stomach full of butterflies!!! Just heart warming. That's all I can say and if it's not enough then I'll have to watch this again so that I can convey my thoughts properly, maybe.. Goodnight and good day
This was so wholesome I cried 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
yo why has it been so long since ive seen you.  now im happier :)
Thomas really out done himself
Oh my good Lord, people, you will not understand the feeling that I had when Virgil freaking push Thomas to the guy. Unless you have jumped and hopped around your kitchen in excitement🤣  Edit: if you don’t hopped and jump around your kitchen in excitement with a mid-eaten bagel in your mouth
I can feel the awkwardness from here but I love it either way
this was to cute for my heart to handle ❤
SO CUTEEE OMG I CAN SOOOO RELATE <3
As someone who loves drawing and animations, this sent me to heaven ❤️❤️❤️
Omg who else is so happy right now!!!!
Do you guys remember when he used to do Vine     I remember when I was like 10 maybe and I would get on my moms laptop to watch his Vines through YouTube    Man time really does fly
Voice crack lol
RISE TO THE OCCASION IS THAT HAMILTON I SMELL
if you look right this whole entire feelings is a metaphor
THIS VIDEO IS THE EXACT REASON WHY PEOPLE SHIP ROMAN AND VIRGIL!!!!!!!
this is my first sanders sides ep but omg the animation is so cute.. might have to stan
This is wonderfully done but I am cringing oh so hard. I put myself into your shoes and ohhhhh nohohohohoho. Noooooo.
i h a v e t h e s a m e l a s t n a m e as the nico man
22:48 "The eyshadow looks nice Virgil. But its the hope that looks great on you <3"
Its been what, months? And the king comes back with a video called "gay or nay" ...  2020 is looking up boiz
PuNk
I felt that "love you" part so muuuch. Some of my friends say it a lot and I only started talking to them a while ago, so i don't know them extreeemly well. But they are loving and wonderful so they'll say it and I'll say it back. Sometimes I'll say it and I'm like "iS iT ToO EaRLy?? Am I using it too lightlyyyy???" AhHH 😂
HE'S BACK                                       YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If only Patton could see the GORGEOUS PURPLE GLITTERY EYESHADOW 😍😍💜💜
Virgil is my favorite, he's a little emo cinnamon roll
I forgot he was still doing Sanders side
Can't help but notice how Virgil's eyeshadow changes throughout the scene at the end based off whether he's excited and giddy or nervous and anxious again, really cool detail! Plus it just looks really good :D
I love this.    It’s literally the definition of gay panic
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER!!!!
hmmmmmmmm i could join the patreon and get that cool shirt orrrrrrr i could move out of my parents houseeee             ima get that shirt !
I love this video so much but it also confirms to me how much Virgil and Roman love eachother (Whether they wanna admit it or not or whether it's romantic or platonic)
you made my day!!!
omg this is awesome!!!
DID YOU GUYS SEE HOW HEARTBROKEN AND PANICKED VIRGIL LOOKED WHEN HE SAW HOW UPSET THOMAS AND (ESPECIALLY) ROMAN WERE  AND HOW HE JUST COULDN'T BARE IT, SO HE ACTED WITHOUT THINKING (EVEN THOUGH OVER THINKING IS BASICALLY HIS MAIN THING)  cause I did ❤️
Shut up emo 🙄🔪
Hes a cartoon again!!! eyyyyy
13:56 HOW DID HIS FACE DO THAT?? WHAT?????
Ok are we gonna ignore that at the end Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black.
Does this mean Thomas has a boyfriend now...?😱😱
Thomas I have a question.
Me: sees the title Also me: 😳
This is by far one of my favorite videos of your Thomas !! 💓
PRINCEY SUCCESFULLY FLUSTERED THE EMO
Omg so cute!!
For the record, the pins thing is accurate. I currently have a Tom nook, earthbender, moon, cat, cat, dog, meme, train wreck, cat cult, anxiety, pansexual cat, ghost cat, cat with book, and rainbow dog pins on my purse. Three people in the past month have started conversations with me because of the pins (one was even a cute theydy flirting!) Pins are great.
Dude I'm 16 and the pandemic is still on I don't think you can put your faith in me
YES I LOVEEE THISSS
I uhh AHHHHHHHHH 0/////0
19:34/19:35 is for all you crazy Prinxiety shippers.
PRINXIETY MOMENTS, IM SCREAMING!!! YOU KILLED ME THOMAS! AND THE PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! GOD IM DEAD!
Does this mean something... that story sounded like it really happened... does he have a boyfriend WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
And you say Prinxiety isn't a thing....Anyways, great job guys!
18:03 wait that worked
10:08 "Gerard Gay" had me DYING! 😆
THAT WAS THE CUTEST THING EVER!!!!
Thank your videos helped me to be more open with myself and to love every possible Nomater how grim thanks you are the best.                                                   -your biggest fan
Roman:just shut up emo  *gay shoulder pat*  Me:.....can I call princiety canon?
I read the title and thought it was gonna be Roman flirting with Virgil- I wasn't completely off, but I also wasn't correct-
That’s wholesome
Thomas don't do this to me I have no money 😭😭😭
Roman: "you're gonna have to speak from the heart." Me: *Patton?*
"Consider joining our Patreon!"  Me, completely broke: shut up and take my money!
❤️❤️❤️Who wants to hear a voice that relaxes his heart and ends his worries, open my channel💝💝💝.
The prinxiety is strong with this one. I approve. Also that purple eyeshadow is everything.
T: "I'm just overthinking things" R: "YEAH! Join me, no thinking!"
Anyone else noticed that most if not all of the lies Thomas was making was because of his Social Anxiety? Virgil's unwillingness to let Thomas go and properly communicate had been the major problem, so they had to get around that and it got him into those situations like the plant and the fake friend, then they call him out and berates him for it later. Like if anyone was 'two-faced' around here it was Virgil.  Also the artwork was so cute and adorable props to all three of the artist, and Thomas amazing job as always I relate to that feeling of Awkward like all the time its uncanny sometimes.
19:56 prINXIETY CONFREAKINGFIRMED I KNEW IT THIS IS AWESOME but watch them hate each other in the next episode :/ still tho my heart exploded in that scene
Roman: QUICK! HIDE! So he doesn't see you in all your shame!  Me: NO! NOT IN THE TRASH!-oh cmon.
AHAHAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW AWWWWWW
This is the cutest episode ever, and just might be my favorite one to date!!!
OMG. The "I dont know... Plants! 💕🥺"
This was too beautiful😊😊😊
I won't say anything other than...       y e s
That last bit... My heart. Princitity. I ship it
The “idk plaaant.?” was such a fucking mood
YOU CAN'T TELL ME PRINXIETY ISN'T CANON OMFDHTRRTJ
Wait he's over 30? Honestly thought he was in early to mid 20's! Hoo-raa for good genes
Uhm- why am i crying i cant tell if its sad boi hours
SO GOOD
Roman: *angry to Virgil* Virgil: *purp man mode activated* Me: ship it ✨w✨~,
This is the cutest art style I've ever seen in my entire life please you're killing me  Update: This is the cutest episode I've ever seen Roman and Virgil working together for once? Now you're just spoiling us
this video is just gay panic 101                 I love it
This literally made my little closeted lesbian heart cryyyyyy 💜💜💜
DOES THOMAS HAVE A LOVE INTREST?! sorry if that was nosy to ask i just really want to see him happy!! hes my idol and if i never found his content i wouldnt have figured out that im gender fluid! and that i like gals and non-bianry pals. and i would never of asked out my beautiful girlfriend. so seeing him happy would make me happier than anything in the world.
Me after watching this: Alexa where do I talk to and find cute guys?!
OH MAH GAWD IS PRINXITY CANON REEEEEEEE
"I don't know what that was" "Bravery" "Hah I guess" "Shut up emo"

5:18 blink182 reference 10:08 yes 5:00 💅✨
virgil and hoo nico have become one and the same-  (edit) and his name is nico fksdhj o.o
SCREAMING!
Logan and Patton: why do I suddenly feel gayer? And why is there screeching???
This was awesome ❤️❤️
AHHHHHHHH I LOVE THIS
I loved this so much
Hear me out, does this mean after the last vid pincy and emo bud got a lil closer? Since they both aprove the "lies", and after romans experiences roman would probably be worst than this, so I am assuming they did smth or helped echother???
am I the only one who noticed that the sides are all colors of the rainbow   roman (red) new character(orange) Jan(yellow) Remus(green) Patton(blue) Logan(indigo) Virgil(violet)    could be gayer
Princxiety is quaking!!!

PRINCIETY YESH YESH YESH YESH “Shut up emo” MAH GAWD YASS
I have never related to an animated character so much in my life. I hope that someday I will bump into somebody just like Mr. Flores🥺🥺🥰🥰
okay but like- this really does kinda sound like what goes down in my brain too lol.  Wheeze.
A Sanders Sides animated series. That's all I can think of atm. 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Fangirling like crazy over this video!
This reminds me of D I D
awwwwwwwwee this is too cute!!
Oh my god, I came back to see what the comments said and I saw one that said something like ‘omg when Virgil is super anxious his eyeshadow is black and when he’s super happy it’s purple!’ And like, I of course noticed the purple eyeshadow when I watched this for the first time, but when I saw that comment I thought it was just a cute head canon. But then I actually paid attention and... oh my god at 22:59 his eyeshadow actually DOES change wow good eye and this is absolutely groundbreaking lol
That ending was so adorable.
So cute! I'm not lesbian but I support the community and my friends that are lesbians or gay's. I liked the message I think it's , "don't doubt yourself and give it your best shot"
This is one of the best animations I've ever seen! I love it!
ANSJSJSJSJBD THE HEART THAT APPEARED WHEN ROMA WAS TOUCHING VIRILS SHOULDER MADE THE FAN GIRL IN ME AWAKEN
being straight and watching this be like:
Hiiii
Who is we
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen.😭🥰🥰😍😍😁😁
Me: *sees title* Also me: oh no the prinxiety shippers are gonna take this out of context...
Is it bad that I ship Virgil and Roman🤭👀🥰
If this didn’t actually happen as Thomas’s romance story I-
lovely cartoon
Wait does Thomas have D.I.D or us he putting on characters
That was so cute and nice
This is how everyone feels trying to talk to someone who you think is cool or you like them
Disney this reminds me of Disney that’s all I have to say actually one other thing DOES THOMAS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OTHER O MY GOOOOOSH GO THOMAS RIDE THE HORSE TO HAPPINESS
This why people ship virg and roman
VIRGIL STIMS!!! VIRGIL STIMS!!!!!!!!
Why does it now say asides?
People watching Thomas talk to himself: 👁️👄👁️    By the way this is amazing!!
Wow blushing Virgil is kinda cute
Wait- did this happened??🥺🥺 Bc that would be so adorable🥰🥰🥰
Wait does this mean Thomas has a boyfriend again or was that just a skit???
Imma need Virgil and Roman to get together cause this is killing me!!! But I love how cute they are. Also I love Virgil's eyeshadow color change!!! Can we get more of that pls?!
Anyone else wondering if Thomas stumbled upon the millions of ship videos for Sander Sides-
AHHHHH! Frilting!
OMGGG that was sooo cute 🥰🥺
So...I'm not a Prinxiety shipper but... this seemed extremely Prinxiety charged to me.  Also when he said, "You have to speak from the heart," I really thought Patton was gonna pop up.  Also also, I love how Virgil was making Thomas do all those little anxiety things. "You need to pee." "I'm gonna need you to shake your hands, Thomas." "Are you sure you don't need to pee?"  ALSO also also, I LOVE VIRGIL'S CHANGING PURPLE EYESHADOW
I said in my mind just let Patton handle it
OMG FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYY
YESSSSSSSSS
Virgil x roman is being ✨hinted✨
OH MY GAY DOES THIS MEANS THOMAS HAS A BIYFRIEND EEEEEEEEK PLEASE MEAN IT DOESSSSSSSSSSSS
This entire episode happend because Thomas had a gay panic. Also timestamp 17:08, Roman x Virgil Thomas please tell me you'll let this ship sail. Edit: I just finished the video and oh my lord that last part ws absolutely adorable! If I were there I would snap a picture of Roman and Virgil and keep it as my home screen! I'm literlly fangirling over that part!
Thomas, I'm beginning to get the vibe that you also ship Prinxiety. Also, the animation is so GOOD! The voice acting is great to, and I love the lesson behind it! Thank you for working so hard to make this content, and congrats on the Patreon! I hope you have an amazing rest of your day, and many more good days to come!
AHHHH SOOOO CUUUTE!

THE BLINK-182 REFERENCE!!!!!!
OMG THIS IS ADORABLE I LOVE IT SO MUCH
My bi heart is going to explode!
THIS EPISODE MADE ME SO SAD
whole-ass romcom in itself
Do a vid reacting to vines with the sides like the ones with them
I'm wondering if the animatic actually happened. That would've been super cuuute!!
i swear i don’t know what’ll happen if you move. BUT if you do you need a place that has stairs so Virgil can sit in the corner
I had so much anxiety watching this...that being said, I would absolutely love to see this made irl
OH MY GOSH, THIS WAS SO COOL! I literally freaked out when he actually talked to him, I was like "YEEEEEEEESSSSS!". Anyone else?😂 also I can relate to this but a straight version
This one made me cry!!!!😭😭😭 it was so good!!!
MY PRINXIETY HEART!!! AHHHHHH 💜❤💜❤❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤❤💜❤💜❤💜
I wish I was an adult so I could contribute
Virgil: "I don't know what that was." Roman: "Bravery."  Okay, thanks, yep I'm gonna go cry now.
Yes! I knew prinxeity was real!! I ship it soooo much!
how was this on my recommended after not uploading for 3 months
This has got be one of my favourite videos yet! My heart!
Its weird seeing Virgil happy
THEYRE BACK BOYS
Dog: **barks**  Virgil: AH DEMON
‘Our... *Final Form’* reminds me of a Voltron episode for some odd reason-
“What are you doing?”  “I dnno... plAnTs?”  I felt that
ANOTHER SANDERS SIDES VIDEO YES FINALLY I NEEDED THIS
I relate to this on so many levels and it hurts on so many levels as well, especially at 12:50
OH THAT WAS SO GOOD!!! thats excited freakout walk aroud the room thing is definitely something i can relate to!
If I am I'll add it to the list- RO RO NO
Haha
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OMG
Ooooh the after credits scene
OH GOOD GOD!
"So...stalking"    I CAN'T BREATHE
I loved this episode! You and your team are amazing and we're all grateful for the hard work and time you put into these videos! I loved the development in Roman and Virgil's relationship; considering they started off in a less friendly way. So thank you! You're all amazing!!
Gay or Nay? 😂
This made my day so much better
PRINXIETY CANNON!!!!!!!!!
Roman: "What are you doing???" Thomas: "...I dunno... plants..."  me too, Thomas, me too
I think my favourite quote from this is, "No no no no, *I* wasn't testing you, I was just panicking."
WOOOOOOO WE GOT THISSSS
go team sabotaging your own relationships because deep down you don't believe that you deserve love :))))
Thomas this relates to me so much xD.I have to go to THERAPY for my social anxiety! Btw amazing video
loved this love it love it love it
My god it has been so long since I've seen Thomas, I forgot how much he makes me smile-
Roman: What are you doing??? Thomas: Idk *plant*
Da end wef da doog gat me to 😄😆
This is prinxiety at its finest
11:00 lol did no one realize the he did Jack / Sean McLoughlin Voice of " Top Of the Morning to ya " 😂😂😂😂
THOMAS I LOVE THS SO MUCH JDJDHRHR
leanz into mic. hello prinxiety community
Lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loved this, only critic was virgil didn't have enough guy liner.
Does anyone else since the Prianxiaty
I can hear the Roman x Virgil shippers from here... amazing episode btw! The ending was really cute! ^w^
I hate myself for not knowing this came out...😭
Virgil is me 100%!!  Cute person: *talks to me* Me: AAH!!! *panics* 16:06
Did he not flush? Did you not flush?
THIS WAS SO CUTE OH MY GOD MY HEART IS FLOATING HIGH UP ABOVE INTO THE CLOUDS WHERE CUTENESS IS STORED!!!!!
My heart melted when I saw Roman And Virgil blush at each other I loved it and this art work and voice acting was amazing!!!! But I do have a question even if it’s weird do you ship Roman And Virgil even a little bit?
omg I got all fuzzy-love-cuddle-nuzzle feels now :3 <3
ever since Janus was first introduced the signs have been so concerned with Thomas telling the truth be it to himself or to others. Especially Roman. Even though deceit has since tried to make peace Roman and Virgil still seem concerned about it.
Roman and Virgil practically flirting at the end of the animation part me: JUST KISS ALREADY
Thomas, I know you’ll never see this, but thank you. I’ve liked so many girls before, waiting for the “right moment” to tell them, only to find out that they’re dating someone, or they’re straight, or just plain not interested in dating at the moment. I’ve considered the possibility before that I’m just too socially awkward to date. I found out recently that I yet again had a crush, and it’s made me nervous. Me and her are just starting to become good friends, you know? I don’t want to ruin that. But, watching this video made me realize that I really just need to tell her. So I’m going to! Tomorrow, actually. Socially distanced, of course. Thank you thomas. Thank you so much. Not just for this, but for all of your videos. You have helped so many people with them, not just me.
My prinxiety heart, it beats and burns with a fiery passion
THE END CARD OMG
Is Prinxeity cannon!? IS MAH SHIP CANNON?! XD

19:30 really thought he was reaching for Thomas’s hand for a minute 🤣 Nope just wanted some carrots :,)
"He fears things too?!"
I thought ‘not safe to watch’ meant chainsaws or sommin and then I remembered corona
AHHHHHH MY LIFE IS COMPLETE THIA MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD AND I LOVE IT
First of all... VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW :D  Second of all... The references- and the gay panic- and omg I love this!!
That was so cute ❤️
I relate to this so much it physically hurts to watch 😂
Thomas: talks to someone Us: OMG HONEY HE MADE A FRIEND Thomas: No
Thomas your amazing 😀 I would trust you with my life and you should believe in your self no matter what
I just realized... If Thomas actually did go to the callback, this episode may never have happened—
This nearly made me cry and I dont cry
17:15 His look be like *gasp* my boyfriend don't be sad  Same with you Thomas   Wait noo You can see him panicking
Virgil: a triple expert! An XXX-pert  Roman: 😶 easy tiger
THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA I SOOOO HAPPY JAVZGKANWAL🥺😻

I think I just found a Prinxiety moment at the end 👑🌩
Worth the wait as always Thomathy

This was so good! The idea with the animation was absolutely brilliant and the execution was so so so good! Kudos to the (voice) actors and artists, it was amazing! Thomas you surround yourself with so many talented people and are so so talented yourself!  Love you guys, this was awesome!

Roman: Id hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay  Me: YESSSS!     Edit: Almost 900 likes what the Hades? Excuse me this was not that funny.
OK but like if you don't think Virgil and Rroman ain't gay for each other after watching this then wtf?

Lemme sum up: 24 min of Thomas calling all of us, and himself, out.
OK you are definitely trying to get us to ship prixity
IS ROMAN AND VIRGIL CANNON?! TELL USSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
I- Prinxiety
Hey I ordered something from your shop a few weeks ago and one of the things never came and I tried to email but I just got an automated email back
I still don't know if Tomas ships Virgil and Roman or not, this video just made me even more confused :')
Ok purple eyeshadow is so wholesome, and the blush Virgil blushed at PRINCY
XD I couldn't breath when I saw the gay or nay? thing
🌸
I'm squirming *this is the cutest shootttttttt*
PRINXEITYYYYYYY Ive been waiting sooo long for this videooooo!!!!

Ok but the first time I cllicked to check out the patreon and I MiSsEd tHe EnTirE OuTro Virgil has a new look? Sometimes? What? Is he turning into bravery?
Wait is no one talking about this line.   “ I got to stop wooing people in the bathroom”
Your Patreon deals are amazing....SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!! XD I hope someday I can afford merch. Virgil is my spirit bean. XD
22:25
I AM ONLY 9:03 MINUTES IN AND I FLIPPING LIVE FOR IT I MEAN CMOOONNN THE GAY EYES.... HE LOOKS LIKE A FLIPPING PENGUIN!!!!
Rollercoaster of emotions but I'm very happy that I watched this!
I hate how people don’t like gay people I say let people be the way they want to be
What do you mean gay eyes don't work?
This video: hey :) Me: anxiety intensifies***
OMG. The tears.
If only I could join the patreon...
"I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" lmao I'm wheezing
Where are Logan and Patton in all of this? Did Thomas just leave his brain at home on accident??
SANDER SIDES IS FUCKIN BACK BABY
The prinxiety shippers right now are probably fan girling right now, plus with their new found ship.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg I loved this so much, so cute
Man just use a gaydar I got the newest model last week
THE END KILLED ME AAHAHSHRIFIFTF THIS WAS SO GOOD THOMAS!!!
i want this to be one of those short films at the beginning of a Disney movie!!
Did this interaction really happen or was it all role play ??
Virgles eye shadow turned purple in some and the usual black in others
I love how Virgil pushes Thomas forward after he lookes at optimistic Roman losing hope -  he knows this is important him and how he smiles when Roman says "shut up emo" - The hearts when he looks up at Roman I- 😭💕😭💕😭💕
Omg omg omg GO TALK TO HIM .... that was so cute
Wow. Virgil really just did that because Roman was sad I love this
Thomas you make my day when I'm sad so thank you for making me happy thank you for making me smile and laugh  thank you for making videos that we all love . Love you Thomas
I smell prinxity
Roman: I think I saw a lot of wide vowels  Virgil: ..Navada?  Roman: More than that!  Virgil: ..Anaconda?  Roman: Anaconda! Thomas, he's a Nicki Minaj fan!   I love these two idiots <3
This is the first one of Thomas's videos I've watched since realizing I was non binary. When he said Non binary pals, it made me smile and it felt so different from every other time I'd heard it before. Thanks Thomas for being inclusive
I asked a girl if she listens to girl in red, but I should've just asked gay or nay
I was just sitting here like "Tomas go get your mans!"
You know Thomas, you are making it really hard to not ship the sides.
Bathroom guy needs a hug
this is the second time watching this. I'll edit this comment almost every time I watch it again (edit: added "every") first watch edit: 3rd time!
Why havent ive seen someone talk about 19:39-  snkskskzjss
I loved that episode
"Gerard Gay" I CAN'T I'M WHEEZING RN
* Hot dude * Me: Is that logan???
This is sort of my introduction to the sanders sides fandom and the "guys gals and nonbinary pals" part had me like :0   Thanks for the representation lol
Omg loved this
Oh man. I'm a pintrovert. And a shirtrovert. If you see me wearing a graphic tee of some now obscure 90s cartoon or a podcast or some other nerdy pop culture thing, and you're also a fan, the WHOLE point is for you to be like "omg i love your xxxx" and then we can be best friends.
now im wondering is there going to be halloween special? Or not cause of obvious reasons
“I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY” NOO MY EMO HEART
I love all the details that are always around in Sanders Sides- I just got to watch this because I haven’t had connection dealing with Delta annnnnnd I’m so hApPy!
(Roman touches Virgils shoulder) Me: AaAaAaAaaAaAAAaAAAAaAaaAAaAaH sHiPpP
Omg this is the cutest thing I have ever seen, I LOVE IT!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel the whole anxiety moment on a deep soul level. Dear heaven's. Cute ending. Love itttt
THIS. IS. FRICKING. AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Okkkk, maybe I'm just a tiny bit too excited?  (me screaming in a pillow at 1 AM
I forgot how much I love virgil XD
Gotta love that Jacksepticeye reference xD
Pls make a better upload schedule
22:22 Le End Carrrrrrd!!!
WHY IS THIS SO FREAKING  INTENSE  AMAZING  CUTE BRILLIANT  AHHHHHH THIS IS SO COOL
Welp, I have a new fave episode-
Virgil:Your making a mistake!!  Roman:if I am I'll add it to the list!!!
Oh my gosh that was so adorable and I'm so happy now and oh my gosh.
PLEASE tell me that this didn't actually. i would litteraly walk out and just ✨l e a v e✨
Hey, this is the first video I see from you and I love it. I have to say that I completely find myself in this situation all the time and not only with people, with everything :). Thanks for the sensitivity and the laugh! :)
I need a Sander Side's full cartoon series. We all do!
I loved “Gerard Gay” for some reason
This is it, gay panic in a video I relate so hard 💀  THIS IS SO CUTE I CANT STOP SMILING OFMAKSNSKSKOSJS ALL THREE OF THEM SCREMAONF AND VIRGIL BEING SO NICE 🥺🥺🥺  "Thomas do you have to pee?" "Are you sure you don't have to pee?"
19:52 - 20:20 made my heart skip a beat  awww Prinxiety 😍 ❤️💜
“i dunno plant” yes yes plant
19:12 had me 😂
I'm gonna make 8:29 my background
I want to gay- IM MEAN CRY! TvT   This is great omfg
I CAN'T........*inhales* THAT WAS TO PRECIOUS.....*starts lilently crying*
Im SOBBING
PRINXIETY GO BRRRR
Alternative Title: The inner workings of a Gay Panic.   Edot: *W O W* OK, 240 LIKES IN 1 DAY, GREAT!! Seriously though, TYASM!!!!!!
Roman: I found a beautiful restaurant...  Virgil: Roman: It's in France... Virgil: I'm listening.
Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh. Its so cute I can't!
Awwwwwwww that's so amazing🥺
Roman said himbo rights
Virgil: you can live like Jack and Sally if you wanted to~ Me: *starts full on singing I miss you*
Congrats on a top 50 trending video 👍😁👍
*Petition for them to recreate this in real life so Thomas is forced to trip/knock over a trash can*
Is this the beginning of something 💖Gay💖
virgil when happy, his dark circles are sparkly
Guy: *talks to thomas the he walks away*   Thomas: *paralysed*   Me: *screaming at the screen* GO AFTER HIN YOU MORON!   Love you thomas, thanks for cheering me up💜
I'm speechless...   But in a positive way
New ship alert:     *Thomas x Random guy he met at the mall*
I feel like purple may mean excitement, but that's just a guess
Prinxiety shippers: “OMGGG PRINXIETY IS CANON”  Me: “Did... did Thomas just post Unsympathetic Virgil and Roman content?”  Edit: People are confused, so I’ll elaborate: Virgil and Roman go through the whole video pushing Thomas to do things he’s not comfortable with and then scolding him for following their directions. My definition of unsympathetic doesn’t necessarily mean evil, but it’s still negative. Roman and Virgil are acting like toxic best friends: going out of their way to make Thomas feel like some reprehensible person for absolutely no reason.
Tell me this is how u met ur boyfriend
*_I would think of something funny to comment but every cell in my body is squealing like a 2 year old._*
Omg that was the cutest thing ever
Omg that was so good!!!!!  I am a gay person myslef and I feel like this would be me
i missed virgil

I got teary eyed watching this!🤧💗
Oh my god        That was so cute 💗
WAIT DID HE FIND SOMEONE!!!!!!!!
That is so cute. I hope that we will get to see it live in the future
I have a question, is your character Virgil the anxiety person the dead brother Terrance for the Afton fam? I am concerned about that.
This video: *exists* The fandom: SCREAMING
I'm so frigin single I'm sad
Mico Florez? Wait... don't tell me. Is he- GAY AND EUROPEAN!
This is definitely my new fav episode!!!💗💗💗
IS THIS TELLING US THOMAS IS GETTING A BOYFRIENDDDDDD
At 19:38 i legit went “ ejdijs hiiiioo yaaaa”
I uh- when it has a prinxiety moment and you die inside
Is that Aki voicing the girl at the ticket booth?
Question: Is this like, a true real life event thing? Did this really happen? Did you find love at the mall?
Oof
Omg! Omgomgomggg!!! I literally had to pause the video 3 times so I can silently scream in joy! I also yelled “MY GAY BABY IS DOING IT!” Five times. Loved the video! Also, i noticed In the end card Virgil’s eyeshadow was purple  sometimes and black others. Kinda made me laugh! Love you Thomasss!
i won't believe your deep state lies. that's not a real dog barking
Gerard Gay *G E R A R D G A Y*
Bruh
Awe I wanna meet niko (if that’s how you spell it) that was such a cute story it has to continue
I’m reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
*Mk, time to try the "gay eyes".*
IM VERY ANGRY I DIDN'T GET THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS C'MON YOUTUBE
This is so cute!!! I was literally SQUEALINGG when the guy came overrr
and now every fiber of my being is squealing
I love how Thomas is giving us more prixiety content because he  knows that we want it like I was just like "LOOK AT THOSE GAY BABIES AHHHH" the whole time
you got me cryin over here thoams, this was amazing ;-; (Also that end clip of Roman and Virgil is so adorable)
Haha a third of me is freaking out at the Prinxiety, the other parts of me are focused on the neighbor's dog and thinking that the neighbors could have gotten it as revenge in a way for how loud Thomas is with his videos. 😂
I WISH IS COULD SIGN UP BUT IM BROKE DAMMIT
Thomas: ( speaking from the heart ) Me: Awwwww!!! Also, why do I get the feeling that that guy Thomas saw is in there with him? Random guy: ( teary eyed ) Noone’s ever said that to me before.... Me: ( loud wheezing ) 😂  16:13 - 16:24 these two panicking is the BIGGEST mood  Nico: well.... let’s not waste this one :3 Me: ( happy screaming ) that was frickin’ pure TwT
Don't go with the live action - it works so much better this way.
Punk little punk.....BUT ABOUT THAT PATREON ABOUT JANUS-
Hi Thomas! Im a big fan of your work and have been watching since the crofter's musical episode! I was wondering if I could make a series inspired off of this? I have DID and this channel makes our system happy and feel welcomed since we're LGBT+ as well, and you've been a huge inspiration! I know you're busy 24/7, but if you see this, we love you! ~TheDrowningFandom System
HOLY CRAP THIS IS AMAZING
This makes my shipping heart go doki doki!
Can anyone tell me why a show about some guy talking to literally himself has genuine character development?
I am actually literally dying Thomas I freaking love you ahggGggGgg
KISS ALREADY!!!          Sorry need to get that out.
wait SANDERS SIDES?????

17:15 AOAOSOAW
Nico's song be like:  Oh boyyyy~ He was innocently walking Definitely not stalking Meeee~  Then he tripped and fell It didn't go well In the trashcan, weeeee~  Then he sadly went away... Why couldn't he stay? I only saw two shoes he had left in the trashcaaaan... Oh, wait they're moving And out comes the trash-maaaan!  ...as gay.
Every minute I watched this animatic I would panicked as to how relatable it is since I'm quite lost right now with what I'm doing.
Is it bad I've already encountered cosplays of the love interest in this on tiktok
YAS omg the gay panic EVERYWHERE
16:06 ALLALSPEPDPDPFFP

I'm sad, I want to sign up, but my mum won't give me a bank account TwT. Also, at the end did anyone notice the Prinxiety, best ship ever!

this video was relatable on so many levels i appreciated it so much and wish there was more art like this out there
No one:   Not a soul:   Me: Do you have a boyfriend!?!!!??!!?!!
As someone with DID this is very fucking accurate.
I'm so sorry but a gay guy named Nico hmmm      Nico di angalo is quaking
1. My Anxiety is named Rider, my Logic is Morgana, my Creativity is Henri, My Heart is actually named Love, my Duke is Kira, and finally my deceit is named Farren.  2. I ship Virgil and Roman  3. Do you think Logan's opposite side  would be Stupidity?
OH MY GOD THE PURPLE EYESHADOW IM IN LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me talking to new people I end up liking a bit to much--*
I got SO much second-hand Roman syndrome from this video, the entire time I was screaming “TALK TO HIIIIMMMM!!!”, but at the same time whenever Thomas did everything I was also screaming “AAAAAH ABORT ABORT ABORT!!!!”
I WANTED TO CRY!!! AND I WILL!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢
Holy crud dude lol
DiD i JuSt SeE rOmAn X vIrGil
Woa I am more shook than more ice coffee logan can drink in a day. 👀😳😎💅💇💁👐
"What are you doing?" *Gay panic* "I don't know, plant?"
His name is Nico~~ Hmmm..  What a coincidence that his name is the same name of the first gay Disney prince~~
I'm sorry but i lost it at "Gay eyes"
Virgil is baby!!
"i also don't want me to doing what i'm doing" love the refrence
PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS REAL!
11:w6 I like to think Virgil grows just a tiny bit smaller when he’s intimidated- Then again he could just be 25/8 slouching here-
e-excuse me pRINXETY?
WHY DID I LOVE THIS SO MUCH IMMA CRY AGHHHHH THOMAS BETTER GET A BF LIKE THAT IM GOING TO SCREAMMMMMMM
This was cutest thing I ever saw!!!! Thomas don’t over think just go with the flow...
I was literally squealing the whole time... 😅
10:08 *snorts*
The end was A strong Virgil x Roman vibe xD
My bisexual trans heart cant take this
when Vergil looked a Roman being sad right before pushing Thomas to talk to Nico made me smile. Also, I hope to see more banter between princy and dark cloud.
8:06 Easyy
7:49 XD
Here have this beautiful stamp card of princxiety 19:40 - 20:05 :)
19:51 HE DID THE PAT HE DID THE GAY PAT
Oh....my....GOD!   THIS WAS TOO ADORABLE THIS WAS AMAZING! 🥺
how are my boys even cuter than normal here?!?!?<3<3<3<3<3<3 I LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!
Him completely avoiding his gay just has me snorting  Like total mood to just make like the incredibles and A B O R T  A B O R T
‘What?’ ‘Ugh. Cutie at 12 o’clock *turns Thomas’ head* ‘
aaAAAAAAAaaaaaAAaaaAah SUCH CUTE
AAAAAA OUR BEAUTIFUL PRINCE FOUND LOVE!
17:08-17:18 and 19:38-20:04 I smell a ship
Roman: “did he not flush?” Thomas: “did you not flush?”  Random guy: “I didn’t want to ruin the moment.”   Omg same!
Ok, complete honesty here. This video hit way close to home, there is a guy I like and either he's just really nice or likes me a little, and maybe I need to take a chance too! Maybe I need to just start a conversation with him and have fun! Maybe it will work out for the best! Honestly keep me in your thoughts, I want so badly to have a amazing committed relationship with someone, but I'm scared that my lack of experience will get in the way. Love it if you'd keep me in your thoughts and prayers. 😅
I LOVED THIS
Met someone on omegle who was doing some Side makeup and my dumb friend thought it was the flag of mexico. Though I didn't know what it was till they told me.
I love how you show struggle of the gays it so sad :,)
Low key been a while since i watches your videos. So i decided to watch them again. I totally forgot how funny it was T^T
Awww it was sooo cute 😍😍
Virgil excitement/panic squealing is something i never knew i needed.
Me: *THOMAS! The internet says you aren’t gay, how do ya feel!* Thomas; “.......”   *”CoUlD bE gAyEr.”*
God I've missed Sanders Sides, WAY too much.
I am SOBBING
HOLY CRAP YOU TEAMED WITH ABD ILLUSTRATES?!?!!?? HAVAJSBWJABBW
no one calls you sanders in your format
I love this so much, every moment is so precious ❤️❤️ 4:42 So true lol
Did Nico see Roman and Virgil?
Omgs “shut up emo” I’m gunna CRYYYYY THEYRE SO CUTE
I can't stop fangirling over this!
Lowkey would've preferred the bathroom guy...
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW BIG VIRGIL'S SMILINGGGG
So this confirms Prinxiety
i almost spit out my iced tea on multiple occasions
My heart just exploded eeeeehhhh
19:51 EVERYONE STAY CALM STAY CALM *OH MY GOD STAY CALM*
I dont usually comment twice, but I have to take notice, the art style, the voice acting, and the video quality in general are amazing
last year when i went to see detective pikachu the cashier gave me a ticket to an R18 movie  i was 15
Did anybody else notice the uncertainty in Virgils eyes at the end
Omg my heart 😍😍😍😍
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!! also this is a full mood and me 24/7 lol
All this has done is tell me that a fully animated official Sanders Sides series would be amazing. Your friends did amazing with the animatic, it was so fun to watch!
AAAAAA OUR BEAUTIFUL PRINCE HAS RETURNED!
And this Ladies, Gents, and Non-binary pals is what you call a gay panic!
I love how Virgil’s eyeshadow gets lighter when he’s happy and darker when he sad aka anxiety
Please make more parts to this I find this so Frickin Adorable!!!💕💕💕
10:46 “ Idon’tknow               plant 🌱 “
Roman, glancing over at Virgil though while looking back at Thomas when they're talking about if they're ready. His response makes it seem like he wasn't just saying it to calm Thomas but to, hopefully, cheer Virgil back up.  Because this may be the first time he has ever seen him that happy and is trying to keep him happy and in the moment and not panicking about the what-ifs and the future.
*11:02* Thomas: Top of the mornin to ya!...  Me: **screaming internally because im a hard-core fangirl**
This is too awkward I can’t keep watching.
Virgil was smiling!!!
This was so cute! I loved it
I love that we get to see the character development in action in this episode where Roman is the most dramatic and romantic we've ever seen him get to be, and Virgil is the most socially anxious we've ever gotten to see him get to be. Like, it's the epitome of their characters, but we also see Virgil making an effort to understand why he's holding Thomas back and even making an effort to be brave for his friends sakes, as well as seeing Roman reeling in his most fanciful ideas by trying to be realistic about the relationship being truthful  (though it goes a but too far the other way with him getting a bit self depreciating trying to say its probably for the best they didn't try with this guy, something that's an as yet unresolved issue with him)
This was so cute!
I love the changing eyeshadow with emotions! Very nice touch!
Why is Roman and Virgil my mind every time when I see a cute girl and guy mainly girl, I freak out and I tell my mom and then she just walks up to the person and says that I think they’re nice or cute and then they come up to me and we start talking but since I have social anxiety I get all weird and say things I don’t want to say so I just leave and never talk or see the person again because it was super weird and awkward (tbh idk how to spell it) and that’s how I act mainly at grocery stores so yea,ima leave now bye
the better version of Logan Paul
I ship Roman and Virgil so much
Me: *sees the title. Sees virgin and roman in the thumbnail* well now i cant miss this. Thomas you clever mother effer 19:57 Well now i only ship them more
I swear to god Virgil x Roman is gonna be canon
if there is one thing thomas has no chance against its when roman and virgil ACTUALLY work together/agree on something
My phone ended up dying at 17:54 and I literally screamed “NO!”
I SAY ITS BACKKK
If the reason this is important to the overall continuity is bc Nico will be a recurring character from now on, that means our first introduction to him is an animation XD Like, we don't even know what his hair colour is bc of the minimalist style, it's just funny to think about this being the first sighting of a character we will eventually know we'll XD
hmmmm..lol Virgil and Roman ship confirmed??? I think so 😁 hehehehehehe I'm sorry but when virgil and Roman go heart to heart to THOMAS. ITS JUST TO PERFECT ♥️💘💛💚💙❤️💜 Just make it happen. PLZ 16:59 when Virgil saw Roman being sad he painicked . He couldn't stand roman being hurt. If that ain't proof he cares about him I don't care I'm shipping them till I die.
he was trying to say a trip to the bahamas
Omg omg omg!!!!!!!!! I can die in peace now!!!!
boyfriend?????????????
100% weirder episode when my name is Nico lmaoo
OMG this was the most heart warming thing ever
Virgil is the Thomas Sanders version of the book character Nico di Angelo. Both emo, both gay, both amazing in every way :)
I wanna do this to help you sooo much but my wallet says NO   Also you are amazing
"If you wanna get-" *ruff*
" I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay" I absolutely loved that 😂😂
Thomas saying "final form" is a bit creepy
not me re watching the "BUT JANUS IS RUNNING IT" part because it makes me happy stim...what....20:28
Virgil at the end telling him to fidget is so freat.
Nico di Angelo ??? Someone ???
why is this me tho
17:16 the moment we saw virgil really care for Thomas and Roman. We also some something different in him
19:38 *all the virgil and roman snipers have entered the room*
This one punch me in the heart bone
I didn't get a notification😞
So many prinxiety moments ahhhh so cute especially at the end💕✨❤️
We just got a new aesthetic  Virgil with purple eyeshadow
I don’t know if anyone noticed or not but in the end card when Thomas asked if we’re ready and Roman was like “yassssss!”  The screen zoomed in on Virgil and he looked a little uneasy or confused maybe? His eyeshadow was black as well and I think that when it’s purple he’s excited or happy or smthn but when it’s black he anxious or smith like that. So like foreshadowing much? Something bad is probably about to happen I can feel it. But that’s just a theory a theory I came up with in five seconds c:
At 23:54 you can almost see Virgil's eyeshadow fading to black. It may be a trick of the light, but that trick was intentional.
Is anyone else noticing Virgil’s mascara alternating from place to purple every other scene at the end??  Or is that just the lighting??
I can't. This video was too cute. I can't.
This is so cute I squealed. I can’t
Ok I didn't expect to cry but ok..
You could feel the tense feeling in the air! This video almost made me squeal! And my family would've looked at me weird. :/
IM SMILING LIKE AN IDIOT AND CRYING A RIVER HELP HAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAA
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" LMAO I'M DYING
pintroverts
Virgil's eyeshadow keeps changing at the end, it's starting to make me think his eyeshadow changes between those two colors (purple gradient and beta black)
Omg. I LOVED IT!!!!! This was so good xxxx
"I don't know, plant?" oh, my precious gay child, Thomas you don't understand how adorable you are
Is this guy based on anyone in particular?
AH OH I SHIP NICO AND THOMAS AHHHHH I LOVE IT
I STARTED SOBBING AT THE END IM SO HAPPY
who am i kidding that was really good and i like it
Man watching this just gives me heightened anxiety. I'm stopping almost every ten seconds
virgils makeup changing 0hhhhhhhhh~ virgie becoming more and more comfortable
I loved this soo much!!!🤩 but now I'm wondering if he is going to do one with logan and patton ?🤔
that was nice and i join the channal
The Trio: *Flert*
Princxiety (idk how to spell it) much at the end? Hmmmmm....
4:44 Me who puts stickers and pins on my stuff: Ya don’t need to call me out like that-
yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyseyesyseyesyesyesyesyesyesyseyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyeysyesyesyeysyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyeseyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyyesyyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyseyesyesyesyesyeseyesyesyesyseyesyesyesyseyesyesyseyesyesyesyseyesyesyeyseysyeyeyesyyseyeyeysyesyseyysyesyyesyyesyseyesyseyesyeyeyesyyeseyyeeysyeyeyeyeyseysesyeseyseysyesyeysesyesyesyeyeyesyesyesyyseyesseyyesyseseyseyesyseyseyseyesyseyesyseyseyyeseysseyeyseyrs
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL’S NEW EYESHADOW
Are Virgil and Romano cheese finally starting to like each other?? I saw those hearts that princey had in front of his face after talking to emo nightmare..
Wow looks like we have a powerful duo here on isle two, imagine what these two can do.  Imagine if it was Logic and Morality, even dad's and brains have their own specialty  Now Janus and Remus, nightmares and lies on every side, looks like these two won't love the love ride.  Roman and Virgil, just the right touch, because they love Thomas so much
so are you dating some one
THAT WAS SO CUTE!!!!!!! MY HEART IS MELTING <3
HE GOT ABD ILLUSTRATES IM SO EXCITED
our ship has sailed!!!! (prinxietyyyy (sorry if i spelt that wrongGg)
That ending scene tho- I SAW THOSE SPARKS BISH
Seeing this after two days: aaahh!!!!! Finnaly!
Omg!!!!!!!!!! I am so excited for the Janus merch!!!!! I am so becoming a patron!!! I love my snake boi!!!!
t t t t the eyeshadow changing is so precious and I wanna cry.
thata mada mea crya
your in person is better
this honestly made me sob
1:20 Hehe Gay - treon
I love your channel! Keep up the hard work! P.s. virgil is my fav!
ITS OUT ITS OUT YAYAYAYAAYAY
I lust Thomas so much! <3
8:47
Everyone: *Quoting things from things from the video* Me:... Me: WHY ARE YOU FOCUSING ON THAT THERE WERE LITERAL HEARTS NEXT TO ROMAN ABOUT VIRGIL. Me: *takes a deep breath in* Me: EEEEEEKKKKKK Me: *continues fangirling*
*me who dont have a patreon*👁👄👁
HOW DID I MISS THIS TWO DAYS AGOOO!?       Prinxiety??????
My friend got very worried because I gasped when I saw the new episode
also OH GOSH THIS IS THE CUTEST THING
ABDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it bad to be watching this while I'm in my math class? And I'm trying to find a way to come out to my aunt can you help me?
"Cough cough" ❤Prinxiety💜
At the same time... Patton: Er- should we- do something?  Logan: There- there is no logical reason for them to act like this what are they doing?  Janus: Oh, I quite like how Thomas keeps avoiding...  Remus: * hiding behind something giggling like mad *
AAAAA STOP EVERY 5 SECONDS IM DYING I ALSO GAY PANIC
okay but how many strangers HAS Thomas wooed in the bathroom??
fed the prinxiety shippers
noice
This is one of my favourite videos ever!!! I literally started to cry
i’m having a break down because this is so cute
Sometimes you have to lie until it becomes the truth.
The princiety is strong in this one.
Aight... This is officially the best animatic I've ever seen in my entire life>w<
THE ENDING WAS SO RELIABLE THO I DO THAT SO MUCH
Dang that was deep
Just should’ve said hi
“You can live like jack and sally if you want”-Virgil      Movie reference, also song reference
YASSSS THOMAS YOU GO GURL!!!! also #price x anxiety
I definitely needed this today 😂 the secondhand embarrassment/relatability is real tho omg
crying face
Most of this video is a gay panic...                           *I love it*
I've literally watched this 5 times and I'm still crying of happiness every time I get to this part... 19:33   I also lowkey feel bad for the anti-prinxiety shippers-
can't believe I'm crying OMG no but really, all of this is just so accurate to me ha ha. The only different thing is that in the end I still don't get to talk to the person and then I regret it all my life overthinking till I die yey :)
Salvation is a free gift. When you believed you were sealed until the day of redemption  Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved
Thomas knew exactly what he was doing when he posted this video, us shippers are going crazy
This whole video is a mood whenever I talk to women 👩‍❤️‍👩 Edit: Attempt and fail to talk to women 💔
Dis be greatest episode thus far
Bro, i've never fangirled so much before.
Omg 😭😭😭😭💗
"BUT JANUS IS RUNNING IT" **Aggressively puts on top hat**
this video is the definition of gay panic
ROMANS LAMP IS ON
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW
I really loved this format!
Finally so excited for this! This was soooo worth the wait!
I feel attacked and understood at the same time X3
I love your videossss
Thomas..... this is amazing! I love it so much!
WHEN I SAW THAT ALEX WORKED ON THSI I SCREAMED YAS K I N G
virgil: **gay panic** roman: *lets talk to him* 😃
Virgils eyeshadow changing colors depending on how he's feeling, amazing
Ok but like can we just talk about how absolutely adorable Thomas and Niko are???!!?! Like omgosh imma get diabetes
OMG VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW!!!!!! 🥺💕💕💕💕💕💕💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA" Sean is quaking
i'm gonna send this to my girlfriend, she will love this
I had to pause the video, THREE TIME, due to second hand embarrassment. XD
ur back! yay
Aw why does Roman always pick on Virgil?
I'm i the only one who senses some prinxity
Me wondering why virgils eye shadow keeps changing is like when he exited it really emotional
Sooooooooooo MOAR animatics? yeah? yeah.
dude that’s so CUTE omg like i can’t that was so good! i just really loved it it was so sweet
The dog can see the sides.
Was the gay joke  a joke? .-. Or no. bc I always saw him as either bi or gay - w -
My dog started barking- 💀💀
omg BEUTIFUL
Me:**Sees this video 2 days late** When did this come out!? Also me: OMG! YESSSSS!
This is the most prinxiy filled expisod in a long time
Thomas and Nico give me Jeremy and Christine vibes from be more chill
I always procrastinate to watch your videos because I relate to them very much but I always watch them eventually and im never disappointed(i wish I could be a patron member also prince x anxiety low key)
23:39 stimming!!!!!!!! Hes happy stimming!!!!!!
"#31 on trending" Congrats Thomas!
Okay but I need to see what "gay eyes" would actually look like because I need to try it
We all saw Virgil blush when Roman called him brave right? Right?!
I-uh-no..... p l a n t s
At this point Thomas is teasing us with ships😂
Xd
Wow . I relate so hard to not knowing what I really want found this one very touching  💕
This made me tear up when he was ( rehearsing his lines) 🥺 Tomas everything will be okay we believe in you, also this video is so cute!
I'm sad that I cant contribute to the patreon Thomas but I am a child and my parents aren't that lenient and probably wont let me have any of these.🥺😔 I love your videos Thomas, you're such a role model for me being a young gay is hard for me, but your videos cheer me up and make me smile, thank you Thomas for all the help.🙂
MMMMMMMMM THIS IS SO CUTEEEEEEEE   Also at the end: nah it’s my patreon (but Janus is running it)  Me: *Chokes on soda* ThEyRe ReAl?!?!?
Virgil doesn't represent anxiety!! he represents gay panic itself       Gay Anxiety Boi       N O I C E
VIRGIL EYESHADOW WHEN HES HAPPY IS PURPLE AND ITS SO ADORABLE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
The amount of gay panic in this video-... I'm loving it. (And why is it so accurate :")
That's it I want a job so I can give him some money for making my anxiety better 🤗
I love this so much :'D it was worth the wait!
Me wish I had money 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is so good, this made me feel so many emotions, more interesting and creative than some films
Love the video Thomas
VIRGIL'S NEW MAKEUP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me:*looks at title* oh? *Does gay hand thing*
i've never had second hand embarrassment like this before aha i'm so embarrassed for him
I always grin so hard watching your videos x
omg i cheered so much for Thomas! i am crying. i love this so much. ^_^
Ahhhh, yes. Dopamine.
You just fueled the Roman Virgil shippers
Pleeeaaaaassseee do a live action after covid!! I loved this!!
Awe, that was so GOOD!
I actually love this
Virgil's eyeshadow getting all glittery purple when he's so excited and turning back to solid black when the anxiety kicks in and then turning back to purple glitter when he's all excited makes me SQUEEE SO HARD!!!!!!!
Thomas : gay eyes?  Roman :gay eyes  Me : **writing stuff down**
Thank god remus and deceit didn't show up. I understand deceit is good now but neither of them were meant for this situation!
Me who can't have Patreon: *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
19:36  AHHHHH YESYESYESYESYESYESYES
🔮
I really want to see this act out, but I can’t join the patreon!!!! If I could though, I would donate more money than I have in my savings😂
YESSSS WEVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG THANKYOU MILESSS
ANIMATIONS??? I AM VERY READY
New best ship: Thomas X Plastic Plant
That. Was. So. Cute.
the amount of seratonin I got from this episode 😂
the ending-
Princeiady
I loved the fact that he had said “We all know love is the best ingredient in all recipes. After salt.” That made me laugh.
Pshh me? Flirt? Nah I just silently admire from a distance until they catch me staring and quickly panic that they think I’m a weirdo creep and look at my black phone screen then get home and start feeling that awkward feeling when you look back on stupid stuff you did in your childhood and then quickly tell my friend that there’s a cute person I saw for the 100th time this month and question “are they tired of me yet?” Yeah.....I.... I don’t socialize much-
PARAMORE I ALREADY LOVE THIS VIDEO  5:02
▼・ᴥ・▼
Anyone else feels like Thomas would get along so well with Sykkuno? I want that friendship to happen...
https://youtu.be/DGYJMm6uFSU
Aghhh I turn 30 on Saturday. Will that make me basically 60?
I totally feel you, buddy.  I kinda get social anxiety when it comes to flirting with a girl.  I just keep it all in my head.
The Prinxiety is *strong* with this one.
ngl that was very cute in the end
Oh my God, that ending was comedy gold.
That was one of the best episodes so far. I’d love to see more animated episodes sometime in the future.
THOMAS'S LITTLE BATHROOM SPEECH WOULD BE A GREAT PROPOSAL THOUGH
Honestly this made me cry. I wish I could approach someone cute without being a baby for once. I actually have "sides" too. And people make fun of me for it. Thomas, I hope you see this. I want you to know that you're the best. And you've inspired me ever since I first saw your content. You've really make me smile when I feel down.
BRO WHEN VIRGIL WAS TALKING TO ROMAN IN THE END AND HE BLUSHED WHEN HE PATTED HIS SHOULDER... prinxiety???
I love you thomas
This sounds like my panic attacks
Thomas: Top of the morning to you, buddy Me: Is ThAt A jAcKsEpTiCeYe ReFeReNcE?!?!
Can you tell us where was virgil during svs redux
my HEART
Ahhhhhhhh! And is Virgil wearing purple eye shawdow!?
Virgil's eyeshadow changing to a sparkly purple eyeshadow when he's excited or happy is so cute 😭
Virgil gets anxious when Thomas is not moving around, so now I can just picture Virgil making Thomas go to the Gym. ps. Virgil is an official Griffindor!
My gay little heart after watching this video 22:35
I just got this in my recommended
ehehdjwbdnd when they finally talked it made /my/ anxiety go *whoosh*
Awwwwwwe!
"Ahh, there you are I was afraid you'd left!"  Vrgil: "AHH! WAIT HE FEARS THINGS TO!?"  My dark strange son why-
Respectfully, Wtf
I half expected him to be like “and that’s how I met my boyfriend” but still AMAZING!!!! 😭
Boiled carrots are delicious. Hmpf.
Oh...godddd!!!!      bring back conscription.
So interesting great job :)
I live for this
AAAAAAAAAAAAA THAT WAS SO WHOLESOME
My prinxiety heart is lovingly this episodeeeee
ITS SO CUTE IM CRYINH
16:13 - 16:21 most relatable thing I've eve seen
the animation was amazing well worth the wait. i love your content so much
DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING AT THE END?? LIKE BETWEEN THE PURPLE AND BLACK?? AND HOW MUCH HE HAD ON WHEN THOMAS ASKED IF HE WAS READY??
So do you have a boyfriend now?
*is nobody going to talk about how we waited so fricking long for this*
Hah gay. I love it
Is thomas ever going to ever get a boyfriend
"You saw me knock over that trash can, didn't you?" "That was you?!" Thomas.exe has shut down.
preesicialy we don't knoww there not gay
Roman: to top it all off he's a poet!! Virgil: *looks over* Me: Wait,...does Virgil like writing poetry like Logan does???? idk
That was pretty cute, awkward and very embarrassing.. Not that my opinion really matters in the end, mmm cynical life views..  I use to be that shy about people I liked, so it hit home seeing it all play out and end on a sweet tone.. Always brightens up my hurricane like sky to see others find happiness, though it's a temporary ray of light that's snuffed out by reality.. I probably shouldn't rant about myself, bothering those who actually read this, but....  Good video, your artists are very talented and lucky.. Have a good life, I guess..?
Patton died watching this.
Hi!!!!!!!!!! my sis woke up at 6:00 to watch this
Thomas: posts a cute animation Me: *SO DOES THOMAS HAVE A BOYFRIEND-*
While Roman and Virgil were calling Thomas a liar I though for sure Janus was going to apear like, laughing somewhere and was really desapointed cause he didnt
22:36
This was so good
Virgil: “Will Deceit continue to be the answer to all your problems?” Me: Yeah JaNuS
this video just further proves to me that Roman is just a darkside that is so passive aggressive that no one sees it.
How else hade a panic attack watching this episode 😅😅
this is why those two should be alone together: EDIT I take back everything  I said
The flappy hands at the end made me so happy because I do it all the time Also, I’m glad they found a solution to the cough cough virus issue
Aw I ship it!!!!
wait does this mean Thomas has a boyfriend? DOES THIS MEAN HE HAS A BOYFRIEND?!?! YAAAAY!!!!
Roman was like: gay eyes usually don’t work  We know he has used them on Virgil and Virgil completely denied him
Oh God this is going to be my future If I stop saying that am not ready for crush .....help
That was adorable!
Me at 19:50 (Picachu sUpRiSe face) All my prinxiety needs have been fulfilled UwU❤️💜
AAAAAAAAAA YES THIS IS PERFECT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
oRaNgE SiDe pLeAsE!!!!!  oh and PRINXIETY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!

Every prinxiety shipper: is.... is this real?????
Anyone know if u can tell if your late? For the Janus shirt ?
Probably could re title this "gay panic" 😂😂
Just watching this is giving me anxiety, ahhhh! I hate being in these situations, ugh.
OMG I SHIP THOMAS AND NICO NOW!-
Roman: thank you Virgil: y-your welcome? Me: Just what I needed
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with Virgil's eyeshadow changing?!
This hits so close to home for lmao XD I can never talk to guys in person like that lmfao I always end up meeting guy online im way to shy and chicken out lmfao
Happy and excited virgil= purple eye shadow!
the switch in Virgil's eyeshadow between being excited and scared
I really like it that when Virgil is genuinly hapy his eye make-up turns a beautifull purple. It really suits him
PRINXIETY !!! SO MUCH ! MMMmmm... Aaaaaaaah omg xD
aaand the shippers go wild y'all know what I'm talking about
THIS IS GIVING ME SECONDHAND ANXIETY OH MY GOD-
Who else felt bad for bathroom guy?
Who else thinks that Remus should have entered and tried to fight to Roman over partial control of Tomas. witch would revolve into a fight between Roman, Virgle and Remus
Prinxiety confirmed..?
*hmmm, yes.... gay panic personified for 20 minutes*
Virgil and Roman are just soo cute with each other too
Ah yes, the gay eyes
oh dear second-hand embarrassment is making my anxiety go “oh god what are you doing stop it right now”  Oh my god “Idunno- plant....” oh that’s so cute aaa
And then they said “You can’t ship romantically two aspects of a person’s personality”...
aweeeee man I’m cryin
I'm crying of joy aaaah 💕😭💕 Thank you so much for this serotonin dose Thomas I need it so much!!
I need "Pintrovert" to be on a shirt please 😁
I've been waiting for this video!!!!

Plant  10:46
N        I       C     O
i wonder what's Virgil's purple eyeshadow meant; it might be a stylistic choice or maybe something else (since it disappeared at around 22:59)
#support #ThomasSanders #gay (DON'T JUDGE ME OR THOMAS S)
Thomas this whole video: *gay panic*
I ship it with Virgil and Roman
You can live like jack and Sally if you want❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love Virgil's voice omgggg🤩🤩🤩
is he gay
"How long is too long?" - "Six seconds"  OOOH, THAT CALLBACK
not only is this cute and hilarious, i think it's also a nice visual to see what goes on in someone's head in these types of situations. I've never really had a lot of situations where this occurs, but i think it's nice to see something like this; nice for someone to understand you.
What about people who can't afford patreon
Thomas, Reprobate God calls the ones he gives up on in Romans 1:18-32 I'm no better than you. I turn to Christ Jesus for my salvation I Hope and Pray you do to.
This made my heart go BOOM.
🏳️‍🌈                                 Your still here? Bruh leave                                                                                                                                                         Bruh you can go now :>
Gay panic insues
What does nico say at 16:20? It sounds like "mind kinda telling me about them". Can he see the sides?? Or did I just hear that wrong
This is to CUTE!!!!!!!😍🤩😺
Virgil's new eye shadow changes a couple times and it's adorable when he's energetic and yet anxious with his purple eyeshadow awwweeeeee
That so cute!
Who else imagine black eyeshadow underneath virgil eyes?
this was the hardest video to sit through
mmm Virgil love the highlighter
I've never shipped prinxiety harder
Sander side shippers where you at!
This was so so cute omg
His speech made my bi heart flutter Edit:Thomas do you finally have a boyfriend
Hey Thomas. Do you want Gabbie as one of your staff members for the series?
Omg Virgil is now just gay anxiety

“What are you doing”  “Eh idk... plant” True Thomas
YES
I wonder why virgils eyeshadow is purple?🤔🤔
WORTH THE WAIT. AAAGGHGHGHGGG. SO GOOOOOOOOOOOD. I LOVE YOU.💔💕💞💓💗💖💝💘
No, no I am not about to start shipping Virgil and Roman... I AM NOT ABOUT TO START SHIPPING VIRGIL AND ROMAN! Aaaaaaannnnnddd I'm shipping it. Damn.
Did anybody else notice at the end that Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black?! Or was that just me?
The moment I saw that Virgil's eyeshadow were lighter I screamed no
so awsam i loved it
Oh my gwod so cute!!! In dead I'm dying omg!!!
Ok but did he get a bf or not?! I need to knowwwwwwwww!!!!!!
Was shipping Thomas with the guy from the bathroom for a second but Nico won me over XD
THAT WAS ADORABLEEEEEE
"I DUNNO PLANT" Whole mood right there
So when Virgil is excited and happy his eyeshadow is light purple and when there is some anxiety with some thoughts or words Thomas said his eyeshadow got dark and cloudy. *gasps* just like a storm cloud! Awwww!!!! That’s awesome!!!!
Thomas has a boyfriend!! If only 😭Thomas deserves to be happy damnit
Me at the end of the animation: *did prinxiety just happen....YAS*
Could be Gayer
The end part with Virgil and Roman almost make me cry- (just to explain a bit I kinda ship them)
I WAS FANGIRLING THE WHOLE TIME THIS WAS SO GOOD AND VIRGIL OMGGGGGGG Please make Virgil x Roman a thing! :>

Virgil had purple eye shadow  I repeat VIRGIL HAD PURPLE EYE SHADOW!!   Oh wait then it turned black again hm  Oh and purple  HIS EYE SHADOW IS CHANGING COLOR
I think we need to add the dark sides to the intro so we have all of them together  Like if you agree
It’s a shame this isn’t canon 😢
Do I smell a ship?
I hate this dude! 😃
That intro was smooth my dude ngl enough of my rambling how are u hopefully u doing good I cannot believe that IT'S BACK I've missed this so much and u are still as bubbly as ever   Thanks so much for lifting me up as well    Sincerely Cameron xxxx😁
YAY another episode!
I love Virgil’s purple eyeshadow! It fits him SOO well! Also I love your channel and your videos have been a big help to me during these troubled times. And don’t forget to be prideful!🏳️‍🌈 💜
19:51 **prinxiety shippers' screaming increases**
Who else is shipping Thomas and Neko p.s. ROMEN AND VRIGL AT THE END OF THE VIDEO I SHIP!!!!!
"You're making a mistake" "If I am, I'll add it to the list!!" Roman, bb, no...

OH MY GOSH IM SCREAMING A SQUIGGLING THAT IS SO CUTE DID THAT HAPPEN IN THE REAL LIFE????? THOMAS???
_When you realize that you're a pintrovert_
I just love seeing them so happy.       Have I rewatched the push scene like eight times now because the ART is just so PRETTY?!?   Yes. Yes I have.
"And we all know love is the best ingredient in any recipe, *After salt"*                                    -Thomas Sanders, 2020
Meerkat milk.
16:09 gay panic ensues
*109% gay*
God I feel this WAY too hard-
iM NOT CRYING YOU ARE AAAAAA
Isn’t this the guy who wrote a doordash delivery note to himself
MY GAY SELF IS SO HAPPY NOW!!!! AHHHHHHH❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💖💜💙
this video just reminded me of even though I have a boyfriend, i’m still forever alone because he’s cheating on me with 2 other people :D
I love how the end is just pure gay panic lmao 😂
This was a perfect example of second hand embarrassment, this had my heart racing.
Every time I watch his videos I just get a boost of serotonin
Oooo when virgil agreed with Roman he had sparkly eyeshadow...  Interesting..
Do you like my new look?
THE EYESHADOW CHANGES COLOR WITH VIRGIL'S EMOTIONS?!?!
😭😭😭😍😍😍
OMG OMG ITS A PRINXIETY MOMENT OMG IM SO HAPYYYYYYYYYYY
Princiety is definitely there in this video
NICE WITH THE MAKEUP THOMAS
This is so cute! I hope you do more animations with the sides x
SANDERS IM BROKE DONT DO THIS TO ME
*prinxiety intensifies*
I love how he's having all this internal struggle while just trying to talk to another gay he saw at the mall
Once I saw vigil again "Deep Breath" HE IS SO PRETTY!💜 P.S. I love Virgil's eye shadow, very pretty.
That was so f* cute (sorry for my language)😆😆😍😍
More important question DID HE GET THE GUY?
Who is voicing Nico?? Is it Joan? Is it obviously Joan and I'm just dumb?? Its driving me crazy! Someone please tell me!!
That was so cute and that help me a lot
No one:    Literally no one:    Not even Thomas:    Me watching this for the 42 time: :p
Oml I saw bts on one of the patreon things and now I'm screaming LMAO
I want more please!!!!!!!!????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sad I'm poor now T^T
My friend sent me this. I’ve never seen Sander’s Sides. I have SCHOOL. How am I supposed to focus with this kind of PERFECTION????
"Gerard Gay"
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
'Because love is one of the most important ingredients in a recipe, besides salt.' Beautiful.
PRINXIETY💜🖤🖤🖤❤️❤️❤️❤️💛💜💜💜💖💖💞💓💓❣️💕💗💝💝💘
When virgil panicked and pushed thomas I verbally went "awww go get em" someone help-
This made me laugh and cry cause this is literally me in real life
Wait a minute! Is Niko just you trying to tell us you’re getting into a serious relationship!!! *GASP* THE FORESHADOWING
omg another great vid
Thomas: i did not have to pee Virgil: are you sure about that
Virgil is me   Me all the time and 24/7   Thomas is my siblings all the way
I needed this vid,having social anxiety and being a lesbian trying to flirt is so hard 😭 love the animation though
love how Virgil is a mood ring
The question that I ALWAYS ask when I see a girl: IS SHE INTO GIRLS (Also Pintroverts are amazing)
Also I really like Virgil having purple eye shadow.
AAAAAA SO CUTE
It would be funny for Patton to give his dog to Janus for him to watch for a while, but Janus can't make it stop barking. So every time the dog barks, I can imagine that lol.
Roman and Virgil are not arguing for once! Yes!!!
I love this so much
I seriously love this animatic style of the sander sides. It’s so freakin cute!!!
I WANNA JOIN THE PATREON BUT I HAVE NO MONEYS ahhhhhhhhh 😢😣
No....I didn’t c-c-cry 😭😭😭
I told Thomas to eat him- I DIDNT MEAN IT THAT WAY!
PRINXIETY IS CANON OMG
Are u Brent revela uncle  (Sorry don’t know how to spell his fam name and I just heard it from my sis)
These are some phenominal artists, what an amazing animatic. Stuff like the last scene really drives home how talented of an actor Thomas is too, it legit became hard to remember that these 3 characters are all played by the SAME PERSON. The voice changes, the presentation. DAmn. What a talented team putting this whole thing together. Amazing.
Thomas: you were testing me?! Virgil: oh no no, I wasn't testing you.. I was just panicking Virgil: no, the Universe tested you and you chose to be a LiAR Me: *cracking up* lmao I think I'm dYING also me: I also like Virgil's new eyeshadow
This is me if I see a cute guy but my social anxiety never push me HAHAHAHAHA
I’d love to continue seeing more episodes like these to keep everyone safe and because it’s visually pleasing ✨😊
I like how the video seems to imply that both Roman and Virgil have not accepted Janus at all. Does this mean the next Sanders Sides will be those two resolving their issues with Janus?
I have school when all of my friends dont, so i was upset, but then i watched this video  and my bad mood is non existent , i squealed more then once XD. Thomas you are one of my biggest inspirations, i sadly cant join your patron at the moment, but as soon as i get the chance im doing it
Aww. 😭❤🌈
Okay, I cried at how much I related to this video. At one point when Thomas was trying to get, 'HIS ONE AND ONLY's attention, I started freaking out, and simply said, "NO! NO! THOMAS! Okay.. Shut up, sit down, and I will get him for you hun." And in my mind, something said, "Yeah, but we will just steal him." XD SORRY! Im so sorry Thomas, I love you, but imma steal yo man, I guess XD
"Idunno-plants..."  I'm almost offended by how accurate that is Ok scratch that-this whole video is too accurate
WAIT, i'm new here. Is he flirting with himself? 💀
Virgils eyeshadow when he wasn’t all anxious is gorgeous!!!!!!! :3
I died at 20:05
So cool
I can’t wait for a live version this was gold
“shut up emo” -all the boys at my school when a girl wears black
"you saw me know over that trash bin didn't you" "THAT WAS YOU" The fact that i've had that interaction before(i was the one who knocked over the trash can)
“You call it weird, I call it DESTINY”
I'm just imagining that the other sides were too overworked to show up and Virgil and Roman were the only ones with enough energy to show up.   Janus looks like he just ran a marathon (from all of Thomas's lying), Patton is screaming, Logan is really close to slamming his head in the wall, and Remus is telling his brother to save the ship. the mind is in chaos, the heart is in chaos, Roman and Virgil are the most stable sides for once
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA---
٠6٠ؤ
Virgil is a good guy, he just needs time to understand
That was beautiful 😭
Did someone notice that virgil eye shadow changes???
Me during the whole video: incoherent squealing- Anyone relate?~
I started watching this series years ago when it first started and holy crap I was not expecting it to still be helping me today. I've been spiralling again lately and this just gave me the motivation I needed so thank you
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is amazing, I love it-
I only just realised that when Virgil starts worrying again in the end card for a second his eyeshadow goes back to black 🥺😅 COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT!!!! 🤣
I think there is an issue ... with the lies ... but I'm not sure, it may be my imagination. Or maybe it's because neither Roman nor Virgil are very fond Jeanus, but again, it could be my imagination :)
the anxiety this gave me aaah but it was worth it
GAY eyes are those really a thing?
I love all the slides and I hope one day I can meet u Thomas I just need to work on my social anxiety 🥺😅
Love the reference to Radiohead!
PARAMORE
This is so cuteee 😍❤❤❤
“Will deceit continue to be the answer to all your problems?” *upset Janus noises*
i swear this man has 24 characters in him
The animators! Simply, *cheff's kiss* it looks amazing, thank you
“That’s like cyber- stalking but in real life...” “So... Stalking?” “*le gaspppp* You’re right!” SJSGSKDJDKKDJ
When Virgil is happy or not worrying about literally everything, his eyeshadow is purple. When he's being normal and anxious about everything and anything, it's black.
I thought more people would be talking about Virgil's purple eye shadow for when he's faithful/hopeful and/or happy. It turned black again when he was disappointed or upset. I didn't actually scroll down that much so there were probably more people but still
16:08 Thomas...,  that scream made my day (sobbing) t-thank you!  17:15 H-He cares! Oh my god... YASS THE PRINXIETY!!  I LOVED THE ANIMATED EPISODE!!!
THAT WAS GOSH DARN FREAKIN' CUTE!!! X3 Well done Thomas and crew on this video!
This is the cutest. I love this so much!
okay I have theories that anxiety is changing and becoming more of a ‘light side’ than he already is. the purple eyeshadow is what’s really tipping me off- when virgil’s being a little over-the-top with his anxious reactions as usual (like telling thomas to immediately delete the tweet), his eyeshadow was black, but when he’s nervous and excited about nico, his eyeshadow is shimmery and purple.
You just gave people more of a reason to ship Virgil and Roman. If you haven't heard about it look up on google Prinxtey
Anyone else notice Virgil's makeup kept changing from Black to Purple?
I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS I AM ASCENDING
I’m gay
YESYESYES
“I don’t know, plant!”
Ngl i was watching this during a zoom meet for school and accidentally left myself unmuted. I’m like 90% sure everyone thinks I’m gay now
THIS WHOLE VIDEO IS JUST THE BIGGEST MOOD I CANT STOP WHEEZING HELPPPPP
I LOVE HOW VIRGILS EYE MAKE UP GOES PURPLE WHEN HES EXCITED OMFGGFFFG
MY POOR LITTLE HEART CANNOT TAKE THIS PAIISISISINDNFHWIDHHDSIKSVXDJKSKSXHSJKXHXJKSKSBXJSKXNDJAKNCHDKKNDJSN I WANNA SCREAM BUT ITS MIDNIGHT
I swear  I think i felt emotions again
OMG, VIRGIL CHANGED HIS EYESHADOW COLOR
Omg is it me or Thomas also ship this...? It was just so cute!
ALSO I JUST REALIZED THIA BUT ROMAN STRAIGHT UP SAYS “IF VIRGIL IS READY THEN WE ARE READY” HE DIDN'T EVEN REFERENCE PATTON WHO HIS THE HEART!  *prinxiety is real and I’m having a heart attack because of it*
I hate you so much vine is OVER
Okay, I actually love this video and if you have to keep making animatics right now for the sake of safety during covid, personally I would not mind at all. I love animatics and think this video was great. Thanks for being willing to do something extra in order to have content for us Thomas. Also just wanted to say that I have been a fan of yours for years and I love you to pieces and think you are absolutely great.  :)
>:O THIS WAS SO GOOD  I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF THAT THIS WAS CANON AND NOT A FANMADE THING, IT WAS SO INDULGENT AND IM  LIV I N G Also? ARTISTS, I LOVE YOU THIS WAS GORGEOUSSSSS YOURE DOING GOD'S WORK OUT HERE
Me every day
I’m currently trying to persuade my dad to help me pay for patreon! Love ya Thomas and Fanders!
Oh my goodness. I'm so glad we got that last little bit,seeing virgil with purple eyeshadow that changed back to black when he thought sad things. Such a small detail but so impactful!
Virgil with purple eyeshadows: *appears* Literally 99.999% that watched this vid: *look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now*
Hey Thomas! You should do a video of trying to do your own Janus makeup while being instructed over zoom 🤣
This is only further motivation for me to get a job, please white castle, call me back
I'M THE SOFTEST THING ON THE ENTIRE EARTH--- DON'T TOUCH ME!! THOMAS I LOVE YOU JOAN I LOVE YOU EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS I LOVE YOU
that poor guy in the bathroom
uh, Thomas?      There's a little thing called secondhand embarrassment.      I now know what it is.               Anyway, great video!!   '     Virgil is ROCKING the new eyeshadow.                   Why is anyone still reading this                 weewooweewoo                 Snek               jeez.
Did nobody else notice that vigils eyeshadow turned PURPLE at the end?! It also switched between black and purple so I’m now curious.
CRYING THIS IS SO GOOD
All man all the “gross profit” and “ok now you’re making me feel guilty” are all sold out. I mean I couldn’t get them because my mom won’t aloud me but it still hurts—
Wait...does Thomas now have a boyfriend, or is he just playing it by ear
yo what was that makeup change for Virgil at the end???? Definitely intriguing, foreshadowing much?
" I don't know, plant! "
The bathroom scene was so cute and just ugh T-T made me sad
YESSSSSS
Let’s just appreciate the creativity and all the work 😭😭❤️
I was waiting for another Sanders Sides video and this video is amazing! Mom thought a was crazy, when I was practically screaming on the PC. Good job Thomas.
My h e a r t
This episode was so cute!!!! I love the animation and I came easily to see more capeside solutions
Y e s  Fooooooooooood
This is why I ship Roman x virgil
sanders asides
WAIT?! What? Is Virgil's eyeshadow a way to convey Virgil's emotion rather than Thomas'?

Is it me or does virgil look smaller than roman?
Gay Panic: The Episode
This literally made me cry, I related to this on another level and idk why but it made me cry at the end
😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Poor thomas has to spend the entire day listening to virgil and romantic call him a liar😂😂😂
Virgil: “But what if it is a mistake?” Roman: “Then i’ll add it to the list” Me : How much is on the list agian?  Jeez i really wanna sign the Patreon but gotta ask my mom = Life be hard out here.   Roman : Shut up emo Virgil : *blush*  Was it just me or did Virgils eyeliner keep changing purple when he got exited....
I’m dying this is just AAAA I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUTIT
How is NO ONE talking about the Paramore mention and pun
Oh my lord this is adorable. Also hilarious. And relatable (the anxiety in social situations part, I haven't actually gotten a crush at a random stranger). And the animatic is amazing! They're all so expressive!
I MISSED YOU THOMAS HOLY CRAP IM SO SO HAPPY YOURE BACK
Roman: Talk Virgil: no ❤️
OMG ROMEN PULLED A FLIRT MOVE ON VIRGIL EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK JDBDUSNSKSBDJDBDISBSHJDDIDBDIBDJDBDIDBDIDNDIDBDIBSDJBD IM HONNA DIEEEEEE
Thomas you suck at flirting XD
Cyber stalking   *but in real life*
Ah! I just died! The ending was so sweet and cute! I’m so excited to see this recreated!
Oh my god I’m gonna cry- yup I’m crying that was so cute ahhh😭💕
Howard from TBBT is back!
roman virgil THE FRICK U TWO
i'm a day late and i'm sad now
I swear I almost cried, I loved this story and yet again, Sanders sides made my day 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I can so see how Virgil cares so much about Thomas and Roman and everyone else from how he acts towards them.
Immm sooooo excited to watch this
Omg I love it 😍🥰
Roman: “how cute” Me: I- :0 Roman ur blushing
VIRGILSEYESHADOWISPURPLEOMGOMGOMFGOIJMJHHGNDFNXDNNFNTFNTGDFB
I was smiling. The entire time in the break room where I work. This was incredible and the art style was so cute! Everything just made my heart swell and to prevent myself from *screaming in front of my coworkers* I had to softly chuckle the excitement out. You are incredible, the artists who worked on this are stellar and   Prinxiety for the win. ❤💜
Joining Patreon at the start of next month! Can't wait.
I do love Virgil's song references, so subtle but so good! "You can live like Jack and Sally, if you want" "You're a creep, You're a weirdo, What the hell are we doing here"
OMG LOVED THIS EPISODE!!!!!!!!
16:21  Roman and Virgil sharing a single brain cell is my aesthetic.
top of the morning to ya...   top of the morning to ya...    JACKSCEPTICEYE REFERENCE
ROMAN I FEEL A SONG COMING ON
... you have the gay look, but have you seen a person blush a little things like talking about there love. Because that is me... I don't know where I was going with this
This was such a beautiful mixture of so painful to watch and so relieving at the same time. It felt like my heart was going to explode with frustration every couple lines. Glad everything turned out well in the end.
HOLY CRAP THIS IS SO GOOD
I ship so much roman x virgil sooooo much
For the patrons,  please enjoy the perks because I wanted to be one of the people who get to enjoy.. but I can't do it. Thank you!
The animation was sooooo cute❤💖 I love it😍🥰💖❤
SHUT UPPPPPP!!!!!!!! OUR BOY IS GETTING A BOYFRIEND
Happy virgel gives me Mount Everest loads of serotonin
Does anyone know the artist for this?
SJDOEJDJEJDJWJDWKDKEKDKWJDN I LOVE THIS SO MUCH ANDJE
Hey Thomas you're probably not going to see this but this episode really hit home because there a girl who I think is the one but am so afraid of rejection I haven't said anything to her.
I lowkey thought this was a prinxiety episode because of the title- aaaaand I sense some prinxiety in the end help Edit: 11:02 Jacksepticeye? Is no one gonna talk about that?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh😢😢😢😢😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
You should start a series where you make short videos where in between filming you have sides answer questions from the comments you maybe could even add sleep and picani
UGH my HeArT
Virgil: * calls Janus 'deceit' * Me: * forgets he wasnt in POF *  Isnt it *jAnUs nOt dEcEit*
Ya hes a fifi
It just hit me that this is Roman and Virgils equivalent of the second episode of the whole series, where "Dad" and "Teacher" were making Thomas indecisive over every little thing
When thomas said "Our final form"
I love how Roman and Virgil working together makes... More anxiety. Like for real, poor Thomas is worked to a disaster whether they're on the same page or opposite ones, this is why they're usually balanced out with 4 instead of 2
When the title said "Flirting With Social Anxiety" I actually read that as Flirting With Anxiety. ;-;
19.50-19.57       i died
oh i wish i could join the patron but I don't have money I'm sorry if this seems like a self sintered comment I just really like this idea and really bumed I cant join i hope you have a grate life and i hope you are staying safe. i really like your video's and enjoy   laughing to your  jokes. i hope you do post full episodes on YouTube but if you dont that is ok.  love a fan
THIS WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE OMG i felt this too hard
Im still kind of stuck on the intro... Is that a Gallavant reference?  "Without further d'dew" o.o
I can't watch this video it's giving me so much anxiety T_T  It's soooooo awkward I can't
Not me watching this over and over
Prinxiety shippers are quaking during this episode!!
I loved this. ! It was cute and fun, Absolutely heart wearming!
I wonder if Virgil and Roman réalisé he was lying because he was stressed out from them.
I do like the fact that they are all acknowledging Deceit's role and how much Thomas has been lying to himself with every day activities And if he wants to be happy then he needs to be honest. To himself and to others :)  The hard part is if Patton can be honest too
You mean he hasn't come out of the closet yet?
I really wanna know how you plan on doing this in real life, the costumes for the sides can’t be easy to put on and in so many public places it must be a pain to film
I just went back to the 'Taking on ANXIETY' episode, the episode where we first see Roman and Virgil interact. And comparing them from back then to now is just amazing. They would argue constantly, Roman was stuck on disliking anxiety and didn't plan on that changing and they would both make fun of eachother every episode. And look at them now. I love those two so much!
Nico: oh my gosh Me: holy crap holy crap hloy crap holy crap pls tell me he like thomas back Nico: You could have just said hi Me: why
The fact virgils eyeshadow is purple when he is excited I think it’s cool!
Virgil looks so gorgeous
thomas: “nothing but a bruised ego”  roman: angry villager noises
SO WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY/FLUSTERED HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW UNDER HIS EYES APSDIAPSODI THAT IS THE CUTEST THING-
subtitles!
Instead of going closer use the zoom function on your phone but look like you're taking a selfie/looking at yourself
ahhh this is sooo cute D':
My HeART-- Aghh its so GOod!
The purple and black eyeliner switching lol
I- I squealed so hard
ashfdjdkshfjsk I've loved it!
The amount of second hand embarrassment I had because I’ve definitely had this happen to me-   the flashbacks ✋️😔
Heaven OR hell
Am I the only one thinking"PRINXIETY(roman x Virgil)"
I love how people ship the different Sanders Sides even though that is technically narcissism.
IM SORRY WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT "Your making a mistake!" "If I am I'll add it to the list!" Like someone hug Roman please T-T
I think Thomas ships pinxiety.... Guys, write that down. NOW.
Is this real life?!
Oh feels! So good to see you again, ah it’s been a hot minute! Ah. Mmmmmmm
Did anyone noticed that roman's phone cover is swapped? In the q & a episode his phone was black and white and Logan was the one with the glitter and gold cover-
Virgil and Roman is so close to be Canon Canon
tbh this is my first experience with sanders side video .. or any thomas sanders video really ..  and Im glad I stumbled upon this beauty
*Thomas leaves the bathroom and there's a really sad scene but before he goes out through the exit sign you get an ad about Starbucks*
Yay! happy ending-
Don't tell me you never saw my comment.
i feel like i'm the only one who cried this was such an amazing animation and so beautiful i dont really know how to describe how amazing this video was
Virgil and roman are u-haul gays 😂
*Hate me if you will but the amount of prinxity in this episode though-*
https://youtu.be/w6b8lnYi0oM
I love virgils eyeshadow 💕
Nobody: Roman: what are you doing? Thomas: iDk pLanT
10:44 me too thomas
I got so happy when C!Thomas was stimming because just aaaaaaaaa    On one hand, I was dying from second-hand embarrassment for most of the episode, but on the other I was so extremely happy and just eeeeeee
THE STIMMING KHDKDKSJSBND I love this so much oh my god
19:51 IS THOMAS LOWKEY SHIPPING PRINXIETY?
“Tickets seem pretty cheap around February” OOOF 🤣😂😭
In short: THOMAS HAS A BOYFRIEND! owo
8:02  Virgil: I'm like an xxx-pert Roman: easy tiger Me: *shrieks a bit* I detect a bit of prinxiety foreshadowing
I've watched this video like 15 times and I can't get over it!!! I love it SO MUCH!!!!!
Who knew that Virgil and Roman are the best detective duo
This was such a prinxiety episoooodddeeeee aaaaahhhfkhawei;fh sklj
Thomas posted this on National Coming Out Day-                                   y e s
I relate to this ssoooossssooo much 🤯🤯🤯🤯☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😖😖😖😆😆😆😆
My princy x anxiety heart is screming
ROMAN HOLDING VIRGIL'S SHOULDER GOT MY SHIPPER ASS SCREAMING DBCHFDBFHCSKGH
This was amazing shhdbdhwhbdbdbehhehdhdbsbhshdbbdhshdbehhdbdbshshdb
D O N ' T  T E L L  M E  I T ' S  R E A L .
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT VIRGIL IS MAKING THOMAS MOVE AROUND, PEE, AND SHAKE HIS HANDS! THATS SO ACCURATE!!!
Nobody: Not a single soul: Not even my gay self:  Not even my Gay cat:    Thomas and Roman: GAY EYES!!
Purple eyeshadow equals happy and excited  Virgil and it’s perfect   Also Virgil snapping at Roman and saying “ Don’t tell me to relax “ just gave me moody wife vibes 😂
I smell shiiiiiiiiiiiip~~~~~^^
I only just got the notification :(
ok but anyone feel bad for the guy on the toilet that thought he was getting a love confession and was moved to tears?
His... his eyeshadow changes? That's a cute idea. Also Thomas! I wish I could send funds but as the fact that I don't have money... yeah. I'm super excited for you and hope you're doing well and staying safe. You're awesome and deserve all the happiness you can get. You got this! I believe in you!
That's gayyy <3
Okay, this is sweet and all-     But is no one going to talk about the fact that Thomas is sitting in a food court, completely alone, talking to two different people that no one else can see-
This one is my favorite so far!
IS NO ONE ELSE SOBINGHDJDBDFU
Virgil with the sparkly eye shadow omg!!!😍
Woooowwwwww   joylavita.com
My Prinxiety Ass: AAAAAAHHHH SO MUCH PRINXIETY- My Analogical and Lociet parts: Oi! Jade(me): S-sorry...
The purple-to-black eyeshadow must’ve been a pain to film
There's literally no way to describe the amazing vibes this filled me with sdfkhldskh
My heart hurts that I have no money
Bean
This whole video is a big mood and I love it! Also Virgil's new eyeshadow is bomb and to finally some up my thoughts on this episode as a whole.  "ehem* Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
I haven’t seen this guy since vine
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is the best thing this world has ever seen. This better happen more in the upcoming videos. Because it is just too darn pure, and cute, and amazing I’m gonna go lay in my bed and squeal of happiness. Don’t mind me! Bye, bye, now!    Edit:Eeeeeeekkk!!! How did I get so many likes!?! This is the most likes I ever gotten!! Thank you, all 642 people who liked my comment!!!
No one: Not a soul: Not even my cat: Or my snake: Roman: " Ive found a michelin star resturaunt.... its in *_France_* "
Love your videos
"Iono Plant" Is a major mood
Did anyone else had to pause, freak out over some parts just cause they were so adorable, or felt like they were calling you out, or giving you second-hand embarrassment? Cause I did xD
So much excitement!!!!   I come back & watch this series so much
Me:sees a new video  Also me: exited/happy stimming The whole episode
I am greatly enjoying the animatic stylizing it gives to it all. I can only imagine what Remus would do with the opportunity
This Hits hard
Did i nearly cry      Yes Did i love it     HELL YEAH
This was absolutely adorable! 😊 I love ABD Comics, so glad you guys collaborated! 💖 And now I have 2 other artists to follow!! Xxx
Yes abd
I gotta say, how WOULD have Thomas done this in real life.  The split shots would be SO MUCH WORK.
This was a freaking roller coaster from start to finish. My anxiety was kicking up a storm for most of it (social is absolutely a terror to my nerves) but it was SO worth watching. Seeing the progression and hearing it voiced in real time was amazing. Especially as we see Virgil trying so hard to break from his own habits for Roman and Thomas's best interests. And in turn Roman commending him for said efforts is just SO SWEET.  Also, I caught the eye shadow thing so fast and it made me ecstatic. I fan-cannoned about that for a fic I'm working on and to see it like, be legit made my freaking whole 2020 worth it.   Thank you and your team/friends/ect for all the hard work. I can't do much now, but I support you with all I have and always will!
Princxiety for life
Omg number ten on trending
Ever since my friends showed me your videos Tom, i can call you tom yeah? cool! i have been very confidence in my Sexuality and i'm BI btw and i love it so Thomas Sanders thank you for showing me your Sexuality and teaching me to love Gays even more! <3 love your videos keep it up and keep making more of the Sander Sides! Virgil and Patton are my fav!  PAtton is just a smol little innocent bean! Love you byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Aaaahhhhh!!!!!
Me: yasss  😤☕️ Roman shut up emo  Me again:😏 oOoOoOhhhh love ❤️  Virgiee: *smiles*
I just realised that this is probably set in 2019 so his trip to Paris would be ruined thanks to corna :(
AAAAAAAAAHHHH THE GAY!!!!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
Skdjsksksjsk Virgil and Roman precious moment dkdnkd omg wow wow wow wowowowowowowow
Who else saw this in recommended and just flipped out in excitement because I did and I am so happy oml this is adorable
I love Virgils eye shadow when hes excited is perfect!
I wasn't going to cry this time ;_;
aaaaaaa I love this video
Me close to the end:OMG NOOOOOO!
I extremely felt went Virgil was building up the courage to talk to that guy. I have literally had a mini hyperventilating session before talking to someone and i just appreciate how accurate the feeling was of watching him do that. Thank you Thomas so much, you've helped me in more ways than you could ever know and we all support you!💖💖💖
This video should be called "What gay panic looks like The Animation"
It is the time to rejoice  *B E H O L D*  THE SIDES HATH RETURNED
Awww this so good
I just love how virgil eyeshadow changes from black to purple
😳;-; me :cursing out YouTube because my notifications don’t work 💢
Prinxienty shippers have entered the chat*
Awe what in gay heaven this was a masterpiece.  🥰😍
I actually cried. I loved this!
10:45  "I dunno...plAnt"  I'm dieing, this whole thing was amazing
not gonna lie. I'd watch the SH*T outta this anime!
the main message of this video is . IT COULD BE GAYER
One word: P R I N X I E T Y -
I'm so glad you were able to safely find a way to get a Sanders Sides done! It's such a small detail but I love the coloured outline so you know which side is talking 🥰
Me wanting to make friends with strangers at the zing store but not.
OH MY GOSHHH IM SCREAMING THIS IS AMAZING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS THOMAS ONCE AGAIN YOU NAIL IT
OMG IT'S HAPPENING EVERYONE CALM DOWN STOP PANICKING DON'T PANICK DID YOU SEE THE WAY THE WAY VIRGIL AND ROMAN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER VTEVTJEEFYKCRBT
Just wanted to say...  1. I love this animatic. Everyone did great. It's very cute.💜 2. Your bathroom speech was sweet 3. Virgil's eyeshadow gives me life! 4. 23:40 😊 5. Have this cookie🍪 6. Here's a second cookie🍪
Sanders sides works so well in animatic/ animation medium ngl
Live Action Sanders Sides is ALWAYS amazing. But I hope you get the chance to use animation again because it suits this format so much!! Not only cause you can get the characters in the same frame, but the cartoonish style is perfect for the Sides' exuberant personalities. Also, amazing voice acting job!! You did it, you ARE a cartoon!!
I had to pause and scream in gay a few times watching this animatic, because this is painfully relatable.
Wait, is this really true or it's just an acting?
The ending is pure chaos and I love it
"What non verbal options do we have left?" "Gay eyes?" "Gay eyes!" "Gay eyes???" *"g a y  e y e s"*
Thomas. You make me happy
so we arnt talking about the tension between Roman and Virgil?
Great job on the animation!!! I do love the live action a bit more but you all do such an amazing job with the script that I still love watching every minute! 💜
Omfg this is so cute!!!
Im I weird for thinking that Roman was going to kiss Virgle when he said "Shut up emo." at the end of the vid
i felt every single aspect of this
anyone else crying... just me... okay :')
the excited kind of nervous is purple omg i could cry somebody help me
WHO ELSE GOT PRINXIETY VIBES AND SHIPPED THOMAS AND THAT NICO GUY SO MUCH CAUSE LIKE AHHHHHHHHH
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN VIRGIL THIS HYPED, IT'S SO GOOD
‘Shut up emo’ lmao
totally not them showing they love eachother using Thomas..totally not.
I have never felt so attacked but understood before
I felt this in my soul
This. Is. So. Damn. Cute.
R: If I am, ill add it to the list!   Is it just me or was that Roman being kinda depressed
This was so stressful to watch but 100% worth it
Is Thomas aware we ship the Sides?
bruh stop trying to make me cry
Me at the end "ITS A SHIP ITAS A SHIP F YEESSSS" im talking about prinxity
THIS IS SO 𝗖𝗨𝗧𝗘
Any other pintorverts here
6:20 to 6:23 is the complete mood in its self. Just saying.
"Required viewing" for the story, hmm? Possible plotful takeaways - Virgil becoming braver and willing to take chances Roman and Virgil working together Thomas having a boyfriend  All these are great though can we just take home all of them? Edit: I wrote this before watching the end card, and I have to add another possibility - "are we ready for this?"
Omg this was so worth watching this I was literally panicing and becoming flustered because I have once actually walk into the wrong store and bought a shirt for no reason WHY because I was trying to tell a girl she look cute😂😂😂
7:04 Did Thomas just quote John Mulaney?
gerard gay
THAT WAS SO FUCKIMG CUTE I CANT EVEN OMFG I LOVED IT!!!😆😍🥰❤️❤️
This is so cute
I haven't seen any other videos in this serious, but this seemed like a great place to jump on! I honestly loved the animatic format.
My dreams came True I AM SOOOOOOO HAPPY
i- wow. I didnt think id cry over this!! I was so happy watching this! Thomas, I do hope you find your happiness and wont "waste" it away with your anxiety! <3
At like 16:22 did he just Mention seeing Virgil and Roman?!?!??!  Edit: I JUSY READ THE SUBTITLES AND THE GUYS SAYS “you mind kinda telling me about them?” AND I AM FREEKING OUT
Dude I need animations from you!
Roman: sad  Virgil: na uh, nope, no, say no more
every time i saw something cute i legit said "Don't be shy, KISS." and I yelled that at flipping Roman And Virgil together bc I LOVED IT AUISGIUGWU IGAIU
I LITERALLY WAS SCREAMING OH MY GOD I CRIED THIS IS AMAZING.
that was soooooo cute!!!!! The beautiful,clumsy Thomas was just so relatable!
Finally yay  a knew sander side vid ^^
I feel this so much thoooo
Prinxiety is canon btw
SOOOOO COOL, this episode was The Best I ever wached
Please tell me this other guy is real I want you to have something so cute!
Yessssssssssssssss! Another sander sides video!
Wonder how the normal people see this
Love the extra thing you did with Virgil!  When  he's happier: purple shiney eyeshadow When he's more upset: black eyeshadow That's such a super fun touch to it!☺️💜
8:30 he completed the atsumu miya -> satori tendou transition
I loved this so much and needed this in my life. So thank you!!!
THOMAS. *flips table* WILL PRINXIETY EVER HAPPEN!!? BECAUSE WITH THIS YOU'RE  *FUELING* MY PRINXIETY!
Yay the purp man is back
Eeeeeeeee

I NEED MOREOF THESE!!!!!!! ITS AMAZING
MY LITTLE PINCEIXTY HEART AHHHHHHHHFMGDHGDHONHTHGLHO
Thomas:AAAAAHHHHH Roman:AAAAAAAAHHHH Virgil:AAAAAAAAHHHHHH Me:AAHHHHHAJAIAIIQHWHWISIEUHWHSHSJSUSI
When Roman told Thomas to look over because there was a cutie, he was looking at my other screen where my new bf was in vrchat and I said, "heck yeah there is." xDD  But in all seriousness, this video strikes a cord because I just took the pludge to ask one of my best friend of a year to go out and he said yes two days ago. ^_^ Keep up the good work Thomas. I love your content and it makes me smile every time. <3
my heart T~T this was so beautiful
virgil yelling demon at the dog is the most relatable struggle in this video
PATTON :c
Loved that video it was awesomeeeeee, definitely need
Is this what your doing now has it benn that long sents  vine
When i heard "I hate to rain on your black parade gerard GAY" I was like 😳
Virgil panicking more because Roman was sad
Well...     Let's not waste this one HUFF HUFF HUFF MY HEART IS EXPLODING IT'S TOO CUTE XJENSJFBNEBFBRXBAAAAAAAAA YESSSSSSSSS!!! 💘💖💝❤💝💟
cute but what did Patton have to say?
WAIT! Is the last side bravery/recklessness?! This has been rolling around in my head and I can't!!!!
He really is feeding the shippers huh.
I have social anxiety
This was so cute and I realized that I miss out on alot of opportunities because of my social anxiety but this showed me that you just gotta belive in yourself for once in your life
I clicked on this faster then Logan could say "FALSEHOOD"
https://youtu.be/1aXc3gcfX6w
THANK YOUU
shippers belike:eeeee PRINXIETY!!!!!!!!!!! 😍
Why is this the most relatable struggle ever?
finnaly some canonical prinxiety! (some what)
Don’t get mad but...Thomas Is gay??? I haven’t been a fan for that long so I don’t know can someone tell me
I hate not having a job because I'm a much broke and much minor but I really want to join the patreon :(((((
I'm sorry i didnt watch it yesterday-
I recently developed a crush on a guy and I’m scared to make a move. Is this a sign?
did..did Virgil just semi stand up for Janus?
The whole endcard is a MOOD! And every time Thomas talks about the plot of these sander sides I get so excited for what they have planned!
shut up :o
Me (a High Hopes Low Rolls fan) when I saw ABDIllustrates worked on this: *audible gasp*
*Thomas walking towards Nico* *Virgil shoves him the other way* Roman: "What are you doing?" Thomas: "I dunno, Plant!"  This hit way too close to home for me
This entire video is just gay panic
hello !!!!! :)
This is the most amazing, cute, hilarious, and heartwarming thing I've ever seen in my entire life! Excellent job on this! I wish this was an entire series, I know it already is technically is, but, it should be an official series. The work put into it and the passion shown is much more than enough given that proves it is deserving of just that.
I love this soo much
Omg this was amazing- I loved the end scene! I love how Virgil’s eye shadow changes depending on if he’s feeling a sort of positive stress or negative stress/worried! It’s so cute and that purple is sooooo pretty! Yay character development! Great job to Thomas and his friends/team! You guys are awesome! Keep up the amazing work! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
22:25 what is one that table?
Me at the end: WHY WHY THOMAS WHY THE CLIFFHANGER
YOURE DOING IT AGAIN YAY!! ^^
Virgil and Roman looking at Thomas in the mirror—the reflections are also looking at Thomas, like ghosts. 😆 Well done
This is utterly adorable!!! More please
That mirror jikoshokai was too heavy. The last thing you want to do is put the pressure of "my entire happiness is dependent on you reciprocating my attraction." Also, it puts a lot of pressure on yourself. Your entire happiness is not dependent on any one person.
I think this was my favourite Sanders sides video!!!! I love Roman and Virgil so much, and it was amazing! Keep up the good work!♥️
I think this was my favourite Sanders sides video!!!! I love Roman and Virgil so much, and it was amazing! Keep up the good work!♥️
"What are you doing?!" "I dunno- Plant-?"
AHAJHDKSVSKD IM LITERALLY CRYING STOP 😭😭😭
That moment when Thomas posts another Sanders Sides video and you realize it’s been so long that Remus was introduced a year ago
Me? No, I didn’t cry,not me. Wrong fan.
this is adorable- i'd love to see it in live action!
#freeblock13kakuma
V: "its like cyber-stalking...but in real life" R: "soooo stalking??" V: "OH YOU'RE RIGHT-"       ABFDHTYFDG I LOVE VIRGIL SM
ok but Roman's lil hearts and virgil watching roman be happy just- it got me.
I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, so that's fun.
Who else finds it cute that virgil's eyeshadow goes purple when he is exited !?💜🖤
I LOVE IT!!!!!!
Meanwhile: Patton: Awwweee..... Look, the children are getting along!!!  Logan (looking absolutely bedraggled) : *Who threw me out the window?!???!!*
I'm rewatching this for 2 reasons. 1: it's amazing and I love it  2: I'm trying really hard to prevent myself from cutting off all my hair in the middle of the night and this is a good distraction. Edit: I failed to prevent myself from cutting my hair. I definitely regret it.
Video: Has Virgil and Roman, called " Flirting with social anxiety " Me: *blink blink* Prinxiety?? 😃😃
WHERE IS MY HAPPY PAPPY PATTON
AWWWWWW THIS WAS SO ADORABLE!!!😭😭😭😖😖💕
I see a hint of princy x anxiety
The end eeeeeeeeeeeeee
Oh my GOOOOOOOD WOOOOOHHOOOOOO thank you I’ve been so paranoid about our boy virg he wasn’t in the last one thankkkkk yoooo
You see my problem is i can go up to a person and get a fun conversation going and make a friend but i cant go further than that like even if i think that person is cute i cant flirt or show intrest to save my life and when things get flirty and cutesy i freak out and i sometimes say weird things
Can we talk about the animatic body language between roman and virgil i mean like👀.........my ship seem like its not sinking
This is teaching me so much 😂 I should try this
This video had me in a constant gay panic
"It's like cyber-stalking, but real life." "So, stalking." .... "Oh, you're right!"
I relate to the entire moment with the trashcan. I have fallen in them many, many times. Every time is somehow worse. Still, not much beats knocking over the alter or getting my foot stuck in a toilet paper dispenser.   Yeah, I'm a klutz. Lol.
I’ve been screaming for days
7:41 I feel attacked
11/10 I LOVE THIS
THOMAS THIS WAS SO CUTE I AM MELTING INTO A PILE OF LOVE GOO EVERYONE MADE SUCH A GOOD JOB
This is just as good as fandom I love it
Virgil's gay excitement at the end... I FELT THAT
My mind basically the whole vid: *PRINXIETY*
Everyone: Loving the Virgil and Roman moments Me: * Is he Gay or European?*
GERARD GAY SFBDJNFSKJB,S
I'm not even a prinxiety but, that last part...
96 eheh
Nico: *sees a cute guy knock over a trash can and then crawl inside it* Nico: hey that’s a good idea for a song
I ship it
Virgil X Roman (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
‘it’s in France’ i’m actually dying
Why is this the most relatable thing I have every watched.
BROO I haven't watched you in so long! Nice to know you are doing well!!! God loves you so much so I wanted to say that ^^ Keep living with the spirit matr
Prinxiety moments!!! Make those to a couple please
the art ✨👁👁✨
This is so cute and cool
PRINCXIATY is real
How am I sobbing happy and sad tears at the same time? This vid was so flipping adorable man.
I got the lovie dovies
Gay? Socially anxious? Yes that's me.
OMG THIS WAS LITERALLY ME WHEN I MET MY NON BINARY CRUSHHH! Pins and all!
I hate how real this is and I love how simplified it seems Edit: I 1000% love this for SO MANY REASONS
JOIN ME NO THINKING!
Dang. I learn more life lessons from these videos than I do from my therapist.
Ok at first I was unsure but I really liked the ending and end up loving it . Still a fan of the live action. Keep safe Thomas and stay healthy. Thank you for your hard workz 😊🥰 Virgil Fan
OMG THIS IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE EVER THING I LOVE THIS WITH ALL OF MY HEART. I HAVE BEEN FANGIRLING FOR THE PAST TEN MINUTES I AM DYING THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS PERFECTION AND BEAUTIFUL I JUST HHHHHDAKKDJFJDSJAL
My anxious boy! I have missed you! And I'm glad you and Roman are working together And Thomas, my precious awkward boy! My precious anxious boys!!!!!!
Okay but that was tiny bit of a fan service with Roman and Virgil lets be real
This was so cute I loved it
"I don't want me to be doing this either"
Okay but come on every single one of Virgil’s coping things for excitement were dead on for me.  “Imma need you to walk around the whole house? Cardio.” “Do you need to pee? You need to pee” “Alright Thomas start shaking your hands they gotta do something there just hanging there” “Are you sure you don’t have to pee?”
Love the sparkly purple eyeshadow on happy Virgil, loved this episode given us some fuzzy moments that just fill you with the good feels loved this Aside episode!
Nico's romantic side: *shaking him vigorously* WRITE A POEM FOR HIM WRITE A POEM FOR HIM WRITE A POEM FOR HIM WR
I love this ❤️❤️
The aftermath gay panic is a whole mood, am I wrong?
I felt all the nervous fidgeting at the end
THOMAS YOU CAN NOT DO THIS TO ME IM SOBBING THIS IS ILLEGAL IM CRYING THIS IS NOT OKAY
God i love this agxhendhhd
PRINXETY IS HERE☺
Broooooo I’m crying
I LOVE THIS
I wish I could walk around a mall, find a cute girl with a pride pin, and start an awkward conversation that turns out to be really nice, and become friends and possibly more
Hey I’m dumb so like I can’t see where people are talking about virgils eye color changing? I just don’t pick up on it. Can someone maybe if you want to give me some time stamps for my small brain so I can actually find them? Also this is a great video and aside from Nikos voice actor link in description is Niko a real person?
So idk if anyone else noticed I'm pretty sure ya'll did. But when Roman called Virgil emo and it reminded me of when Remus called Virgil emo in that intrusive thoughts episode. Idk what this could be alluding to exactly. I mean I have some ideas. But yeah
Oh so this is what this guy been up since vine ... glad you survived man 👍🏼
I think im seeing him ship roman x virgil i think and that makes me sooooooooooo happy!              also is thomas actually in love with him (like is he a real person he loves?)
I want there to be a revenge character how awesome would that be?!?
dis is cute uwu
I’m shaking this is adorable
Why at the end was virgils eyeshadow changing from purple and black
THIS IS AMAZING
I love how this describes me perfectly
im really happy that this came out when it did, because since its coming out day, i decided to finally come out to my friend about my crush on her. this made me feel a lot better about it
awww, I'm gonna die alone
oooo that foreshadowing with virgil shshdhdh
Do you think you can react to the annoying pigeon meme sanders sides
congrats on trending thomas!
Was anyone else stressing for Thomas throughout the entire video
I honestly didn't know he still uploads...
💖💖✨✨THAT WAS SO GAY, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!✨✨ 💖💖
can we talk about how us fanders got thomas 14 on trending? we’re so powerful😌😌😌
Omgggggg yesssssss aaaaaaaaaa videoooooooo
I AM SO INTROVERTED, THIS SPOKE TO MY SOUL
This was so adorable and very relatable :') I loved this so much🏳️‍🌈❤️
You’re awesome.
This is cute 🏳️‍🌈
It’s really cool!
WHY DO ANIMATIONS ALWAYS MAKE ME SQUEAK?!?! HAAAAAA!- and my prinxiety shipping part of me is so excited rn- and the way Virgil's eyeshadow changes if hes too excited
The worst part of the episode...       Was when the episode ended...
I kinda ship roman and virgil
I love the gay panic between Roman and Virgil at 16:08
Can you be gay for yourself?🤔
Oooo
Ok I’m 15 and I don’t understand the intro joke
Virgil: **Happy Anxiety Boi with Purple Eyeshadow** Demon Dog: **Innocently Barks** Virgil: **Surprised Mad Boi with Black Eyeshadow** Me: N o i c e  Theoretically Speaking (Don't get mad at me Logan-) I think some smelly ship is going to happen-
Wow this is on number 9 of trending this is crazy proud of you Thomas
FINALLY
god i ship prinxiety so badly, this was way too much for my heart to handle
Okay I’m rewatching this and I can’t stop thinking about this: does anyone else think Nico kind of sounds like Carlos or another character from Welcome to Nightvale? I mean spooky man if it isn’t Carlos (I haven’t listened to it in a hot second!)
YES IVE BEEN WANTING A VIDEO LIKE THIS FOR SO LOOOONG-
That was gay in so many levels
I'm sorry, but I saw a HUGE amount of prinxiety in this! I think I saw Virgil blush multiple times and he went out of his comfort zone to make Roman happy! I might be overanalyzing, but I don't care!
Virgil:does something nice because he doesn't want to see roman sad.  Prinxiety shippers (myself included): ladies and gents this is the moment you've waited for Me:screams and fangirls at 11: 53 pm
weird and ebegging ,  feels2020YTman.    "PLEASE I'M OPPRESSED GIVE ME MONEY"   get lost dood.
*Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads*
ok so moral of the story virgil and Roman goes with thomas and Thomas simps over someone it is there fault he is in a HUGE GAY PANIC  nobody's elses fault  nice
*To whoever is reading this , I hope you are successful at whatever you do and stay safe 💓*
Virgil literally told Thomas to do  what I was doing watching this video!
17:05   *Can we just appreciate how panicked Virgil looked when Roman and Thomas were sad?* *that was adorable how much he cared about their feelings*  _especially Roman's feelings-_
The only thing that has managed to bring me more serotonin than Haikyuu being back has been this video
I'm surprised I haven't seen any comments on the fact that *_JANUS IS RUNNING THE PATREON-_* Edit: Wait, wait, wait... NOOOO WHY MUST I BE BROKE-
sana all
When he yelled patreon my anxiety went *Yeet!!!!* through the roof and I tensed. Yeesh Castiel (the name ive given him) calm down
1. “ToP oF tHE MoRNiN’ tO Ya!” 2. The bathroom guy do be looking like Hamilton  3. This is absolutely adorable 4. Roman used to be my least favorite but he’s grown on me so much these past episodes. I felt bad  for him last episode and I understand where he was coming from, (you crazy Roman stans in the replies) but he was still acting like a jerk and they need to have a better relationship. EDIT: I KNOW ITS JANUS I MADE A TYPO AND DIDN’T SEE IT TIL NOW! I KNOW MY MYTHOLOGY PEOPLE FUCKING HELL!
Who else is just gonna keep watching the end :) AHHHHHHhHH sO CuTe!!!!!!
Aight who is voice acting the guy.                                                                           I HAVE A NEW SHIP GUYS
thomas deserves a boyfriend so much
This was real and true that it was so fantastic, I loved the drawing designed of virigil,Roman, and Thomas.
Finally!!   I was early   Without watching it from 1 year ago
me, shaking my hands cuz PURPLE EYESHADOW: virgil: im gonna need you to like- shake your hands me:  :0
Boop
are we gonna just ignore the fact that princiety is VERY cannon in this video??
*Me* Ok Brain If We Fail This Test We Have To Take Math Over Again  *Brain* Ok Im Ready  *Me* Ok Whats The Awnser To Question 1  *Brain* Idk Plant
So my little black heart ached just now. I’m pretty sure I died a little from how wholesome this was
"I'm now realizing how thin my apartment walls are" when it's clear he lives in a house I'm confused
Heavens, that ending. "Are you sure you don't have to pee?" My anxiety to a "T."
I love what you did with Virgil's eyeshadow!!!! It looks really cool! Amazing job on the video!
Anyone else thinking that maybe Virgil might become a different sander side based on how he acts??? Yes? No? Barbecue sauce?
Why is NO ONE talking about how Roman basically made a bunch of dad jokes (or at least bad puns) in a row? Patton would be proud
wait does this mean thomas met someone if so congrats
Thomas, lying the first whole episode and getting CALLED OUT for lying the entire episode Deceit, nowhere to be found UGH, I loved this so much tho
THIS WAS SO ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!! If only things like these happened in real life- I bet they have just wish I could see one of them.  Oh and I was an old fan but left but I’m glad to be back. THIS IS HOME
Virgil: *looks at Roman* me: GAY THAT'S GAY
so........ we arent gonna talk about how thomas made a jackspeticeye refrence at   11:30
(My opinion please don't hate)  This whole video is why I think Roman and Virgil should be a couple. I mean, it's already kinda obvious that they like each other (that's what Thomas makes it seem like)
I love this to the bottom of my heart. The animation is so cute and I am losing my marbles over it!! I would honestly not be upset to see more animation in the sander sides series
This was so adorable!!! Keep it up thomas & crew!!!
Roman: speak from the heart Me: BuT hE iSnT hErE
i need a live action version just for the bath room scene alone
Man, I missed our bois! 🥰🌈
Don’t mind me just my Prinxiety heart going crazy.
This is really good, good job!!!👏👏👏
This is so good I almost cried
Roman: Bravery  Me: Has a seizure and falls off the bed
Thomas are you trying to tell us that you have a boy friend
I-I.. I relate to how much you overthink, get clumsy and panic over a crush... I've only ever really liked one person.. I spoke with her but I was just so awkward and clumsy and I'd nearly have a panic attack every time I saw her.. I still feel like I'm such a mess for not taking any chances cause of my anxiety. I wonder if it's something wrong with me because even after two years I think about her a lot.. Sorry for venting to a bunch of strangers like an idiot.
A flustered gay in their natural habitat
So... stalking. Oh, you’re right! That exchange made my heart so happy. This episode really said soft Prinxiety
MY NOTIFICATIONS BETRAYED ME FOR NOT GIVING ME THIS VIDEO IN MY INBOX!!!!!
this made my day omg so cute T.T
Priniety be like- hdhrfhfolcvdoidpueujjbisid
brobro my heart i love you but my heart melted your true love ahhhhh
Lmao the poor guy in the bathroom. I felt for him man I wanted to hug him he looked so upset.
Hey! Question! Do you like Legend of Zelda, Thomas? You don't have to respond, I just wanted to ask.
This episode hits home for me. Recently, I got my crush’s number but I’m so scared of making things awkward that I haven’t talked to him that much and I’m afraid he’ll hate me.  But this episode gave me a surge of courage, and I just wanna thank Thomas and the team for the amazing content, this episode especially was really great! Damn, really wish I wasn’t broke, I would’ve joined the Patreon in a heartbeat XD HOLY CRAP VIRGIL’S NEW EYESHADOW IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS DHFDJDHFKSHJ I LOVE HIM
*Ah, Prinxiety is strong with this one*
that ending was so cute I’m going to die oml
"shut up emo" that hit a little too close to home ngl
I barely coment but OMG this was soo cute! Also the animation was gorgeous! I wish I can support but im poor 😂  love your vids <3
It makes me sad that all your much is  in dollars so I can't get any hm unless I can and I'm just being stupid anyway love you byeeee
H a l p
Me when I find out Thomas uploaded a video: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥳🤩😁😆😁
Virgle is me
When we going to meet Time? Edit: I'm sorry if I'm pushing to hard it's just a theory I have, please don't hate on me.
I would like to donate but my parents won't allow me... soz...
The emo references in this video make me so happy Paramore "For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic" Blink-182 "You can live like Jack and Sally if you want" My Chemical Romance "I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay" Radiohead: "You're a creep, you're a weirdo" Also, this video is literally Prinxiety moments and I am so here for it!!
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen and I love it!!
A lesson to take from this episode: If you knock over a trash  can in public and you are humiliated simply crawl inside the trashcan and contemplate the decisions that lead to that moment.   😂😂 Sorry idk what that was
OMFDNRUHSHS
I dunno.... plant
I think its ironic that there was a Oreo LGBTQ support ad
VIRGE IS SO CUTE IM CRYIGN
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜   Can we just sit down and appreciate the hard work but into this animate? The artists deserve a lot of love along with everyone who put in SO MUCH effort into this. Thank you for bringing this smile and this laughter.     I’m kind of getting Prinxiety vibes at the end of the animatic. X3     I *LOVE* that Virgil’s eyeshadow changes when he’s happy. ^^
I nobody going to point out that Janus apparently runs the Patreon?
I'm new why does he say we
I almost cried around the end cuz it’s so beautiful
Virgil: GAH DEMON me: that scared me but demon? Little overreaction... Totally did not also yell out demon
Yesssss
Aww Virgil did pushed Thomas to be brave to make Roman happy! Excuse me while I go cry.
“huh... delete it.” Virgil and everyone’s anxiety 2020
Can I please get Roman as my wingman?? He’d get me to talk to so many cute people it’d be great
That's so sweet 🖤🖤
Ngl when Virgil said "Is Deceit gonna be the answer to all ypur problems?" I was like, "Where is Janus, anyways?"
Without Logan around there intelligence stat combined is about -7
Did anybody else think that the video would be about Roman flirting with Virgil?
Ok, but like, "I don't want me to be doing this either, and I will gladly sit back down now," has the same vibes as, "I don't like that I'm in that lane either, and I sure would like to get out of it."  You can NOT tell me that that line wasn't meant to be a John Mulaney reference 😂
I love how at the end Virgils eyeliner turned a purple whenever he was hopeful and happy, then black whenever he questioned himself/Thomas  VIRGIL IS SO FREAKING ADORABLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY!!!
One word....      THIS WAS PURE PRIXITEY I LOVE IT THANK YOU
ah ah ah, u see, Virgil says that they need a plan because he's part of the left side with Logan, and using a plan would be Logan's logic. Roman says for Thomas to listen to his heart, because he's part of the right side with Patton, and Patton's logic would be to speak from the heart (Patton also basically /is/ Thomas' heart.) I dunno I just figured this was interesting. :p
Hey,Thomas I'm a new fander and you prob won't see me again but I love your videos and everything you do! I can't join your pardon I'm so srry. But I will support you by enjoying your videos and I love you and Whoever sees this comment You are beautiful! (Ps tell forge and part I love them and decit SnAkE boi)
All of these scenes are adorable. *Ah dEmOn-* Best line in the whole episode
Is this based off a true story? Cuz this is really cute.
Yay! I love your videos! Keep up the amazing work!💕🥺
Usually I don’t watch those kind of videos, because I find them hard to follow. But I decided to watch this one, and I don’t regret a thing. I love it being animated, I can follow it waaay better!! This was so gay, I loved it. Please make more!!
This was so amazing!!
Excuse me, YouTube.     *Why was I not notified?*
Me noticing how dynamic Virgil and Roman are this video: *inhale* P R I N X I E T Y
Nobody: Not a soul: Not even my cats: Not even the people at my school: Virgil and Roman: LiAr
14:20 Top 10 anime plot twists
Ship lol
Sorry to say this but at the End did I see a Pricexiety Moment Eeeeeeeeee! I'm sorry but I had too okay I love gay Pleople there the best!!!
This inspired me to go outside and try talking to people again! Then I remember there's a plague and everything's on fire. So instead I played baby animal gifs.
Me: *sees title*  Also me: Prinxiety?? 👀😲
Can I just say that you, Thomas Sanders, influenced me to be who I am. You influenced me to come out to my girlfriend as Polyamoris and she doesn't care! I can now be myself without having to worry about it. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!
https://lnkfi.re/memorieskegeo
Not me thinking i was done w my prinxiety phase only for thomas to drag me back in with the longing glances, blushes, words of affirmation, & little drawn hearts ahh i love them😭
thomas: “nothing but a bruised ego” roman: 👁👄👁
I legit screamed when I saw there was a new video
When Virgil hyperventilated before pushing Thomas i felt that
This was awesome.
I feel this. This gave me so much anxiety, but it's so true. Sometimes I get so anxious about talking to strangers my anxiety kicks me to do it then i say the first ramble that comes to mind. 😭😫😂😖 Some of my friends think im so werid cuz my anxiety makes me both an introvert who does really random extrovert things.  When I do that it never goes so smoothly though, 😂😂😂😂
Okaayyyyy am I the only one getting Phil DeFranco vibes lol. No hate... Its just Saturday sooooo maybe Im just missing Philly D lol
Ahhhh I’m so happy!! I love Sander Sides videos!!! This was adorable!!
Aw so cute!    I also ship Roman and Vergil
*gay wholesome panic intensify*
AAAA GUYS THE EPISODE IS HEREEERE AHHGGGVDBBBRBSJJSFHDHDH YAY
R we not going to talk about the princixty moment at the end 😱🤩
alternate title: Thomas suffers gay panicᴛᴍ for almost 18 minutes
Virgil telling thomas to stim is giving me life
Is Janus a new personality that hasn't been shown on youtube yet?
*looking at the laptop with binoculars* *sees pins and buttons* Binoculars: Ight ima head out
alternate title: being awkward and gay
This
Did anyone else get an Oreo ad about gay flavors when they asked if he was gay (that’s pretty gayyy)
Why does this make my heart go “!!!!!!!!!!”
HHEEEEY BUDDY, MY FRIEND FROM KINDERGARTEN WHO HAS A WIFE.
It’s so cute I love how there getting alone but I’m a Prinxiety shipper (I didn’t remember how to spell it😅) and I was so glad when I saw Roman put his hand on his shoulder and talked calmly and sweetly to him. Also Thomas will there every be a new side because all of the sander sides have different colors and all you need left to make a rainbow is the orange side I was just wonder.
virgil has successfully claimed my heart once again. congratulations mr sanders sir
My second hand anxiety was really bad while watching this. Love it tho!
YOO THIS WAS DRAWN BY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER ABD ILLUSTRATES GO WATCH ALL HIS VIDEOS ALSO I THINK THIS WAS MY FAVORITE VIDEO SO FAR IT MADE ME HAPPY STIM
virgil with purple eye shadow i love it!
Did anyone notice how worried Virgil was at the very end before the dog?
Happy Virgil is so weird to see, but it's so pretty XD 😂😂😂😂
that was beautiful, all of it
Am I the only One word wrong if this is a true story?
i will be rewatching this video until the end of time
I love how Roman calls Thomas old a lot but he's also him so he's just making fun of himself without realizing it
How do you feel about people shipping the sides? Because this increased it
THIS WAS SO CUTE THE END HAS ME IN TEARS
“ i dunno , *plant* ..”
I loved this!!!😁♥️
OHMYGODOHMYGOD THAT WAS PRIXIETY AT ITS FINESNT QAT THE END OHMYGODOHMYGOOOOOOD!!!!!              ps i love you and all you have done thomas!!
OMG THE PURPLE EYESHADOW IS SO LOVELY!
I love it so much
Roman: "you need to speak from the heart."     Patton in the background: "EeEaAuUuuUHhhH!!"
Thomas  you are perfect and I love you thank you for what you do, from me and all my alters! Sam gets especially excited In the fact you acknowledge them as a non bianary, as its a very rare occurrence. You have also helped me work through many of my stress and anxiety over the years.
Tava com tanta saudade?! (I missed you so much?!)
NEW VIDEO OUT!! NEW FISHING YOUTUBER ! PLEASE IF YALL GOT TIME JUST CHECK IT OUT ! AND DROP A SUB!!! & SHOW SOME LOVE TO THE VIDEOS ! GOD BLESS🎣🎣💯u
Super cool to get out in public with the sides!
Oh my fricking god seeing my favorite art youtubers touch in these drawing is so cool!
"If I am, I'll add it to the list!" wow, the unintentional angst Roman always adds somehow makes me smile and cry every time
SO.  FLIPPIN.  RELATABLE.
"Top of the morning"  TOP OF THE MORNING TO YA LADDIES MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE!
I down right love this. Oh wow,l its amazing. AWSOME personalities you have.
Me just realizing thomas is just roasting him self about being old: 😲😂😂😂

I can’t even keep eye contact with cute boys on the street. I get so anxious that they’ll be mad that I’m looking at them. I know that is absurd because I’ve never felt that way, no one has ever actually gotten mad at me, and I’ve never seen anyone get annoyed at someone else for checking then out... yet I avoid eye contact anyways.
Thomas: "Yeah, I'm just overthinking things." Roman: "Yeah! Join me! No thinking!"   i just thought this part was underrated lol
2:52 Omg I love Virgil just looking like he's done with everything and eating popcorn. He is baby.  Edit: 5:13 When I saw Virgil's face, I just said out loud to myself, "Look at the baby!"
That was the cutest thing ever
That was so fluffy i love it
It look like this was supposed to take long than 6 mouths
One word           *:S H I P:*
But for real......  is true you really got a love interest?      If you do CONGRATULATIONS!!!
God made adam and eve not adam and steve. satan loves no one! Lord Jesus Christ is our true Savior 🙏🏼❤️🕊REPENT, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
But DO tell me, did that actually happen?-
Dose anyone remember when he was known as the vine guy
omg this is my favorite sander sides video yet
THE SHIFTING EYESHADOW AT THE END
Roman, dude, killing it with the dad jokes.  At Amazon*🎄🎄.. please stay safe https://tinyurl.com/y4wp79x3
I just wanna say: that this is an instant comfort video type, I love it so much, oh my god
Very princxiety loaded episode...             ThAnK yOu
THE DIFFERENT EYE MAKE UP WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
OMG MY PRINCEIXITY HEART!!!!! I was mad about the lack of everyone else but the cute gayness and princiexityness made it my facprite episodw
I just wish there were subtitles available! Its a little harder without the lip reading to understand the english lol
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IS SO CUTEEEEEEEEEE AGGGGGGGGG ESTOY LLORANDOOOOOOO ES DEMASIADO TIERNO
Everybody talking about virgils eyeshadow Me who’s color blind and can’t tell the difference 😢
“I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard gay” omg. I nearly choked
AHHHHHH!!!! HE POSTED!!!!!!!
Ohhh myyyy ggooooOOOOOOSSSHHH THIS IS SO CUUUUTE!!!!!!!
I'm learning so much
please please PLEASE film this once this covid stuff is over!!! This is immediately my favorite Sanders Sides video!!!
Does this Nico guy exist??? I really hope so!!!!!
Omg, let's just talk about how fucking relatable this video is. I'm newly bi and I have found myself doing the bathroom rehearsals more often than I ever did for boys. I can't say how happy I am for this video to finally come out. OMG, I want a live-action
THIS IS SO CUTE.  Thomas, I don't know if you'll ever see this (hopefully I can pledge and/or meet you some day) but if you do, I want you to know that showing these experiences and parsing out what makes people do what they do (especially teenage and young adult train wrecks) is so comforting and gives hope to so many people.  This is EXACTLY how I feel and react when I see a cute girl.  I like to think I'm a confident person, but when I see someone I want a relationship with I panic and my suave demeanor disintegrates without a trace.  I've had a girl come up to me and TELL ME SHE WAS GAY TOO after seeing my bracelet and I was so shocked that I didn't even realize that she was flirting with me until I HAD LEFT THE STORE.  I tried to go back and find her but she was gone and I still wonder where the pretty girl with brown curls is... Also the end of the video where you, Virgil, and Roman were freaking out, that is the most relatable thing I have ever seen.  Much love <3
STOP DJSNDBD MY PRINXIETY HEART IS SCREANINGSHDHHDD I'M ACTUALLY CRYINGGGG
Thomas: **has guy flirt with him** Roman: Shut up Virgil: Shut up Me: OMG SHUT UP!!! AAAAHHHHH!!!
That was adorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Neko is so freaking cute 🥺
Oh my god this episode is beautiful, i relate to it so much, i loved it
Thomas: *breathes*  Virgil & Roman: “YOU ARE LYING, NO RELATIONSHIP IS BASED ON DECEPTION!”  Me: “... he... what... he literally... nothing he did was anything resembling lying...”
I’m very happy with this Sander Sides episode 😀
*confused and happy screeching*
Anyone know other romance stuff similar to this??? This put my on a romance kick, and I don't want to watch this on repeat more than 5 times!!!
This was so amazing if you make another sander sides like this that amazing or if it’s like the others that’s cool too just stay safe and keep making great content please
Dudeeee that end was soooo cuteee❤️❤️❤️
Yo all he had to say was Patreon and I was clicking the link. I’ve wanting him to get a Patreon FOREVER!!! Literally I only support one other channel on Patreon. YAY!!!!
THE END THE VERY END LOOK AT VIRGIL'S FACE NOT ONLY DOES HIS EYESHADOW GO BACK TO BLACK BUT HE LOOKS DOUBTFUL AND LIKE HE REGRETS THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED OR SOMETHING AND I'M TOTALLY *NOT* GOING TO NOW ANALYZE THAT FRAME BY FRAME AND TRY TO GET AS MUCH INFO ABOUT IT AS POSSIBLE. NO TOTALLY NOT
This is the best thing ever! I loved the end bit!
Fair to deicit or what
IS IT JUST ME OR DID ANYONE SEE THE GAY EYES VIRGIL WAS GIVING ROMAN?!?!?! PLEASE THOMAS JUST SHIP THEM ALREADY I CANT TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did I just see some Virgil x Roman at the end!? YAAAASSS!!!
the gay panic is strong with this one
STOP MAKING ME CRY
I literally squealed when he said “well let’s not waste this one” I want something like that to happen to me
at the end though of the animation is prinxinety real
I love this episode!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
The shippers are gonna go crazy
...i ship it...
can we talk about Virgil's shadow
Unbridled truth yes ty.
Wait did they just, did they just draw this to hide who it is?! Or is it al fake 🤔
*quietly wonders if Thomas ships his sides as well, such at virgil and Roman, ect*  . . .
I’m just curious, is there gonna be more content on the Patreon or is the whole series gonna get moved?
WHAT THE HECK YOUTUBE WHY DID I NOT GET A NOTIFICATION FOR THIS?!
Seeing the Disney castle in the background sparks much joy ♪(๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑)♪
This was literally one of the cutest and most relatable things I’ve ever watched, thank you guys for making this despite everything going on!!!
Roman and Virgil-*making cute little gestures at each other* Me- GET TOGETHER ALREADY!   ALSO ARE HUFFLEPUFF DESERVES THE BESTTT.
This is amazing, i love the art.
WHY DO I GOT TO BE POOR I WANT JANUS STUFF MY BOI :'(
Me but it never goes well, I just think "Oh she's cute," and then go "She's not gay,"  and slightly cry when I pass by her.
Roman: talk form the heart.  Me: GET PATEN!!! 😭😭😭
Man, never expected the animatic episode. Though this is a pleasant surprise, like finding out your going out for Mexican Food at a Mexican restaurant
Can you please make more Vines please your the best vine maker!! :) I subscribed to you btw! :)
ok the purple eyeshadow KILLED MEEEE
I like- Words? Who’s she ?  How to describe feelings abt this video?  Tkogorlfogkftkykttkohoovbtkvkgjuhuhjihjjhjkyhkkuhkuhkuhbdvkrlkr  Ya know?
Oh my god I am crying I love anxiety and pricey also please keep the animeted thing
My god if Prin and Anxiety we're complaining like this I would just talk to the dude.
Ok this might be a very stupid question... but is Nico a real person? Or is he just some made up guy?
The dislikes are the workers who are annoyed with people being human
This was so nice! I loved this episode! Great job everyone who worked on this!
Omg this episode was so good >3<
Virgil' eye shadow when he is happy and it turns purple is ADORABLE, I cant even right now- this whole episode is amazing and cute.
In conclusion always remember: *gay panic*
I love this so much ❤️💜
It's been so long~ last I've sang this song..
I felt the second-hand gay panic
Flirting with Social Anxiety | Sanders Asides
This fills me with anxiety, so I can identify
Is- Is Princiety Cannon?!
I though for a second Roman was gonna say, "Tell him you like his buttons and a**"
Imagine this as a soap opera episode tho
The way virgil looks at roman at 13:53... ❤️💜❤️💜😳 My h e a r t.
Virg was gone last ep and now hes making up for lost time😂
My heart cannot take this
My heart was not expecting that but....I LOVED THAT!!! 💕
This is the gayest I have ever seen Virgil and Roman together 🥰💜❤️ #prinxiety
I love how Virgil 's eye shadow changes to light purple when he's so happy and keeps smiling and being optimistic!!! He's so pricking adorable!!!
Congrats on it being #9 on trending.
Does this mean thomas got himself a boyfriend?! Omg yes!!!! Nico x Thomas , Flores x Sanders
Thomas went "Gay eyes? Yeah they don't work," and single handedly called out the entire community in two sentences
Best episode ever
The animation style makes them look so precious 💜
“I dunno, plant”
this is,,, tHE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER WATCHED
EEEEEEEEEEEK IM SOOOOO HAPPPPYYYYYYY I LOVVVEEEE YOUR VIDEOS 🥺🥺😊
Yayyyy your Back! Love your videos Thomas
Wow this was really really good
Where are my jikook fans at "Jack and sally"
16:41 why Thomas why 😭
Yassssss so cute    At the end of the animation I started to tear up cuz it was so cute
*HOLY HELL Thomas, I swear- your just adding on to ALL THE PRINXIETY SHIPPERS*
Just ran into this issue earlier. Saw a girl, wasn’t sure if she was bi or gay. The bu struggle is real🤣
Well this just warms my heart!
This hit such a nerve, I'm like this whenever I see someone I like I get nerves and just oooooooh everything goes wrong.
THIS HITS DIFFERENT@!@!!!!
i could never
Did anyone else notice that in the thumbnail of the episode with the aftermath of wedding episode, where it says pick your side it shows Virgil, Remus, Janice and anither blank spot? That makes it as close as possible to cannon that there is in fact going to be another Sander side in future, and i have a hunch it's not going to be a positive one, as it was grouped with the traits Anxiety, Deciet and Negetive Creativity. If ot were a more positive one it might've been grouped with Logan, Pattan and Roman. Which also supports the theory that there might be an orange sander side!!!!! Which is very exciting to think about, when you imagine what other personality traits Thomas could have and what they would be like!!!!
Two moments that I absolutely FELT: 1) "No, he's better off without me." 2) "DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN!" I felt this vid so much, I love it!
I absolutely loved this episode so much😤✨💖
I’m gonna cry omgggggggggg I love it so much
Oh mi GOSh!! I LOVE THIS SM!!! The artist did such an incredible job! Keep it up :D
Thomas Sanders- keeping us sane through 2020.
Love, the message is cool, the thing about bravery, and being honest to your partner, but I do want to say: Love does not equal happiness. Not romantic love anyway.   My parents, my uncles, my aunts, and my grandparents, they all found themselves less happy with their partners than alone, and whenever they started working on themselves, the people they were with were a bonus, not a requirement.   Keep that in mind Thomas, and it's also advice for all guys, gals and non-binary pals.
Okay I’m not sure if it was a blush of embarrassment or what but did yall notice that tiny little Prinxiety moment at the end 😳
I’m- I’m going to say it. I really can’t stand Roman or Virgil in this one... There’s a few cute moments, but still....ugh
Is that a castle in the background? Neat!
12:50 me when I shift into Naruto to confess my love for Itachi
The last part was prixiaty
Like... Nico from Percy Jackson? 👀
I’m crying. I literally am crying. This was amazing. Also, #prinxiety shows in this episode.  🏳️‍🌈❤️💜
You really said to Roman “stop little honky ass” anyways this STUCK SOMETHING IN MY HEARTTT
The fact that they animated Virgil to look at how disappointed Roman was before he shoved Thomas at Nico made my heart go all warm. This whole episode has given me such happiness and yet made me so sad because my god if I don't do this in my everyday life.
"what are you doing?"   "i dunno... Plant?"
First, 19 on Trending 😀 this is amazing mate. Roman: "We don't know if he's not gay 😏" Thomas: "You have used that argument on me, far too many times 😑"  I can't lie, this was an amazingly relatable episode. Also                             *gay eyes* and *jarrad-gay*
THIS WAS SO CUTEEEE
Omg finally 😭😭😭 so worth it 💕💕💕🦋🦋🦋
Dog: Barks  Virgil: AH! DEMON!  Roman: Dude, relax. It happens thirty times a day-  Virgil: Don't Tell me to relax!!  That is the literal definition of me
AN ENTIRE EPISODE FOR PRINXIETY! THIS IS THE BEST!
This almost made me cry tears of joy, so beautiful loved the video! 😊
I wish I could join the patreon SO MUCH
Wow, I didn't know he was gay.
I really liked this
Me:*sees the new vid and says*. YES FINALY SOMETHING I LOVE WATCHING YES
This is waaay AWESOME!! :D
ALL OF MY FAVORITE ARTIST ARE HERE WTH
Reality never like this tho 💀
how did a 20 minute short make me cry????? what the hell??? I haven't watch a sanders side video since I was a kid in highschool and now the man has me in tears. Good lord I wish I'd never left.
Virgil be doing the gay eyes <: 19:42 - 19:55
We need to see a live action and I know I’m not the only one that wants it... am I?
the amount of deceit in this video without deceit actually showing up is 📈
22:23 - 24:13 never related to virgil more then this whole scene especially 24:03
My heart melted
Thomas your literally the cutest human being ever!!!! You inspire me so much and I love you so much for that!!!! Thank you 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
This as the most adorable thing I loved every second!!
It's sooo cuteeeee it even made my day! It's also my birthday. I loved it!

Thomas uploaded a new video and nobody told me.....I’m angry
Why is this me-
Virgil Is the new hulk. Virgil be strong
Congrats on being #9 trending!!! 🥳
Ahhhhh! I love ABDillustrates💛
"THAT WAS YOU? ...are you okay??"
“Feeling like a trash bin and the wastes keep piling up until it inevitably...spills out!”   Is this some kind of foreshadowing or just a summary of the whole Sander Sides plot
BRUH I LOVE ABD!!!!
So how did you come out
“Omg...you should’ve just said hi” I can’t-
Me: Ay are you social anxiety cause you make me nervous when im around u Social Anxiety: Yes
No one cares get off the internet
OK but like did you see how Virgil's under eyes changed colors cus I wanna know why that happens!!!!
to the 257 dislikes, YOU BETTER EXPLAIN YOURSELF
Loved this it was funny and beautifully done also congrats on the patreon and I'd be happy to support
“I don’t know plant” is my new favorite phrase
#9 on trending YES, THOMAS!!!!
I was doing the hand shaking thing throughout the entire episode! this was so gosh darn lovely and you are a lovely human being!
I was slightly uncomfortable watching this but im glad i stayed till the end
Is Sanders Asides a new series, plus I just noticed Karrot King, and Thomas hates carrots, was the orange side revealed as Wrath or Anger, possibly Insanity?
Oh my God that was so good!!! I was screaming in happiness at the end I was so excited!
22:30 I would repeat this scene over and over and over for the rest of my life It MaKeS mE fEeL sO eXcItEd I imitate them when they squeal and when they silence each other HAHAHA
It’s animated so obviously prinxiety will make it into it
Did any one else notice that virgils eye shadow is a sparkly purple when he gets exited?!?!
I want something like that qwq
I love this, at first I didn’t like it because I was expecting some Roman angst... but now I love it ❤️
This would be hilarious in live action
Aww did you see how happy roman was.
*YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I SQUEALED WATCHING THIS.*
“ this introvert really likes talking to themselves” 😂
I still haven’t seen a comment about prinxiety Which I was kind of anticipating
I found the ending bit (where Virgil has the purple eyeshadow,) very relatable for a reason other than what I feel was the intended meaning. It actually had the same/a similar feel to a manic episode. I have a Bipolar diagnosis and it really felt like hone to me. :D Anyone else with Bipolar or manic episodes feel this?

🥺🥺🥺
I just noticed Virgil's eyeshadow changing between shiny purple and black
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Seeing my son Virgil so uncharacteristically giddy and Thomas-like, blushing and flusteredly covering his face before excitedly shouting with Thomas and Roman........ I could f*cking CRY
so funny
Tfw you were waiting for an episode for three months, and that's everyone XD
Blehhh babies I love u, but like lies aren't always bad! It's O-K!!
What if there is an episode where deceit convinces everyone that Virgil wasn’t real and it was all just a lie Janus made up... spoopy
Wait so the bathroom thing has happened multiple times
I was supposed to go to sleep.... god dang it! I have a class at 11 and I need to do my morning self shaming routine where I weigh myself, work out for half an hour, and then weigh myself again expecting change Edit: fucking worth it! And prinxiety was all over that video and I loved it!!
"I hate to hate on your black parade Gerard Gay"  -Roman 2K20
OMG ITS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGJT I HAD TO.STOP MYSELF FROM SCEAMING
Who loves Virgil?  This person does!! ↓
this is SO well done!! from the story, the voice acting, and the whole ANIMATIC!!!! MAJORR props to the animators for this because WOW. it literally felt like i was watching a sanders sides cartoon/anime episode!! gosh everyone who worked on this did SO GOOD!!!
I can relate to this so much! :D
My heart is about to explode
*THANK YOU THOMAS!!! 😭😭😭 I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THIS*
This made me very happy and gave me the warm fuzzies! Thank you for continuing to make these videos! :)
Did anyone else notice Virgils eyeshadow jumping from black to purple in the end? Interesting.... very interesting in deed 👁👁
Did any one see a small glance of  a Virgal and Roman ship
Excited purple eye shadow Virgil being canon is literally serotonin for me.
This is hilarious! I can totally relate!
Theres thomas blushing...  AND THEN  VIRGIL AND ROMAN... IS THIS PRINXIETY I SEE?!?  But its very cut I like it😁
HEEY! I hope everyone is having a great day!😁 if anyone here supports LGBTQ you should checkout our channel🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
What is going on with Virgil's eyeshadow at the end
MY VIRGIY BOY!!! (Ok I’m sorry I’ll leave 😅)
I really love this omg
Not gonna lie, I started to tear up when Thomas and Nico started talking. 🥺
My prinxiety heart cant!!!
I’ve never heard “Shut up, Emo” said so affectionately. I love it!
To be honest, I like these animatics better.
Can they make it into a romcom movie, please? I would watch it and I am sure that I won't be the only one.
"WhAt are you doing?"  "Iuuoo- plaant"  same, b
"You're making a mistake!" "If I am, I'll add it to the list!"  ...  o  u  c  h
can we just talk about the princexity in the video?
I think I actually prefer this format! This is really cool
Dad, I love you, but I had to pause this and walk away for a moment So Many Times
Everyone's gonna make this as a virgin x roman thing, aren't theyb😑 Do love the vid tho 😊
Y'all why 14:27 look like Asahi for haikyuu
10:07 "I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE, GERARD GAY" is possibly the best line I've ever heard
GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK IN ACTION
This is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. 🥺
I loved this can't wait to see more <3
My heart melted when Roman said “shut up emo” lol
Can you pleaseeee have sneek boi/de and poor misunderstood child/rat man/remus interact with each other also IMA SLYTHERIN and I think Virgil is a hufflepuff because he is suck a bean
The shipping material in this is immeasurable. But I mean Prixiety not Nico and Thomas, but I do like that ship tho but the time when Virge was looking at Roman with THAT FACE 19:59
I just noticed something when Virgil is really happy his bags under his eyes turn into a light purple but when he’s anxious they turn into a dark almost black purple, I like that detail lol
Roman's smirk at 4:36 "You don't know if he's NOT gay" is the most perfect thing
i am crying right now omg,
THIS IS SO CUTE AHHHHH
I love ur videos plz do more 💗
I follow everyone who likes this comment, keep it up!!!!!!
virgil sitting on the sink gave me mad JD vibes
Commenting before I watch the vid to see if this was in any relatable to my experience with social anxiety. Will edit.  Edit: Yup. Reporting a very relatable video. This was great and as someone with social anxiety, the pin system is a real thing and is relevant. Same with computer stickers my god. I may not be an introvert but honestly this is still relatable. Thanks Thomas, you’re great as always!
Hold up Patton is kinda basically Thomas's emotions right? Does that mean he's also been panicking-
“He’s in his thirties he might as well be sixty” WHYYYYY DO I FEEL THIS SKSNSIDNDIDND
I think I know what the next sides will be about, and I kind of want it to be drawn for some reason
I am so happy
THOMAS I MISSED YOU AND THIS MADE MY DAY AND YOU ARE AMAZING
Virgil stims Virgil stims 🥺💜💜
could have been gayer... or could it
Wait.... IS THIS HIS WAY OF SAYING HE HAS A BOYFRIEND!
Remove the social in the title and you have a lovely video
Virgil's eye shadow changes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the stimming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ah! too cute! too perfect!
Thomas, this video gave me something i haven't had for a long time. Hope, it gave me hope that someday I'll find someone who is perfect for me and who i can connect with. Thank you, i didn't realize how much i'd missed it 💖💞🌟✨
The purple eyeshadow on Virgil at the end tho! 💖💖💖
Has any else noticed how Virgil's eyeshadow becomes this iridescent purple when he's optimistic? Thats SOO CUTE!!! 😻😻😻😻😻
Dude, Virgil's make up change, dude. I loved that detail! Tbh honest this is my favorite episode so far!
Was this just a video, of Thomas telling us, that he possibly has a boyfriend?
STOPPPP VIRGIL GETTING EXCITED AND HIS EYESHADOW TURNING SPARKLY PURPLE
Heyw
OMGGGGGGGGGG!!!! That’s AWSOME!!!! This was amazing!!! :D
"I hate to rain on your black parade gerrard gay" SLAUGHTERED. ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED. TORN. DOWN. ST E L L A R. Came back to finish watching & "shut up emo" was so *adorable*
NOOOOO I want to see the patreon things but I'm a minor and can't pay for them 😭

Omg "top of the morning to ya" the JACKSEPTICEYE reference
WHY CAN'T PRINXIETY BE CANON!?!?!?
ITS TRENDING CONGRATS !!!
Prinxiety is confirmed. You can't change my mind.
“You’re a creep, you’re a weirdo... what the hell are we doing here?” Ha! I just got it!
;-; ok rip the guy in the bathroom-
Roman And Virgil: *Constantly bossing him around at every single possible moment to do something*    Also Roman And Virgil: YOU CHOSE TO BE A LIAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This adoreable! I ship Virgil x Roman it is so adorable!!
wait a second... Virgil's eye shadow isnt black... wow, our edgy bean is slowly turning purple
Thomas answer me yes or no is virtual going to start opening up or is he forever close to the rest of the world because of the fact that he represents anxiety (your anxiety to be exact)
OKAY BUT LIKE WHAT DID NICO ASK THAT MADE HIM SAY HE’S NOSY
PRINXIETY
OMG I LOVE THIS. I WOULD TOTALLY WATCH THIS IF THIS WAS A TV SERIES 😭
How to be a heartbreaker? Become the inspiration of that person ❤️✨
"your making a mistake!" "Ill add it to the list-!" oh my... roman you okay buddy?
This is so amazing!!! Love to Thomas, the team, and all the talented artist❤️
THE HEARTS BY ROMAN AFTER HE SAYS SHUT UP EMO I SMELL A SHIP!
Am i seing this or VIRGIL WAS WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW?! Does that mean that he's slowly becoming an official "light side"? :00
Prinxiety shippers are screaming right now
This is comedy gold and I love it props to the artists and props to you Thomas for making you such comedy gold
amazing this might be my favourite now  but accepting anxiety is a close second
Okay that was literally the cutest thing ever!!!!
VIRGIL: Will Deceit will be the answer to all your problems? Is that fair to him?  I think that he meant both Nico and Janus...
Did Virgil’s eyeshadow chaNGE WHEN HE WAS EXITED-  OUR LITTLE EMO IS BECOMING A SHINING STARRRRRR!
I waiting for so Long you killed me! And made my day.
OMG JUST PLEASE  give EVERY ONE THAT KIss  FROM ANXIETY AND CRATIVITY
aaaaayYAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*Gerard Gay*
DOES ANYONE REALIZE THAT THIS MEANS THOMAS MIGHT HAVE MET SOMEONE?! AM I THE ONLY ONE GETTING THIS!??! AHHHHH THOMAS IF THIS IS TRUE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU EXCITED
THIS WAS SO CUTEEEEE I NEED THE NEXT EPISODE OR IM GONNA DIE THOMAS YOU AND JOAN ARE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AT MAKING US EMOTIONAL!!!! ❤💜 I love you both so much thank you for these videos!!!! Also did you notice that Virgil had way more eyeshadow today?     ALSO AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED HOW MUCH VIRGIL WAS SMILING AND LOOKING AT ROMAN ESPECIALLY AFTER ROMAN SAID IF HES READY THEN WE'RE READY?! SCREEEEEEEE
okay I know I commented three times now but know but this is absolutely amazing and I love it, very relatable, the ending is super cute, I love it so much, thank you, that's all...
I related to this so much, and this is so adorable!! I love it so much!!
i- purble
Man when Roman touched Virgils shoulder I was screaming prinxiety
Video starts at 2:15
YES. A NEW VIDEO!
I'm crying😔✨
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE PATREON: Sorry for yelling, but is it better to put my $5 a month here on YouTube, or to the new Patreon? Which way gets more cash to the crew?
The Eyeshadow is purple, it looks so good on him!
Ok let’s look at the facts; Thomas said this was essential to the plot, Virgil pushed Thomas instead of seeing Roman sad, annddd Roman said “shut up emo” in a loving way and Virgil didn’t object or fire back! * Prinxiety noises *
What’s ships do you approve of?
oh! virgils eyeshadow at the end :D
This is CUTE!
This is perfect! Thank you, Thomas!
Omgg the way that Virgil’s eyeshadow changes when he’s truly happy is a phenomenal detail! I love that!!
OK BUT IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE PIN
i just saw this, this is the first sander sides ive watched please someone tell me abt the fandom im liking this and their characters
Honestly this is probably one of my favorite Sander Sides. I really like the style and how you can show Virgil, Roman and Thomas in the same frame is so cool. I think you should do some more sprinkled in with the normal because it looks so cool!😄
Live action of this would be excellent, if you would pull it off that would be wonderful
Nico... As in... Nico diAngelo... As in... The first gay Disney prince? *Do we have another gay Disney prince in Thomas’s life?*
im so happy for them
All of the Prinxiety shippers are living for this video
OH MY GOD WHEN I TELL YOU I SPRINTED   Edit: I just- **cries** THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
THIS IS ON TRENDING WOW
i have no idea what this is or how i got here but i’m not complaining
I adore this😭😭❤️
THAT ENDING!!! Are they purposefully feeding the prinxiety shippers?!?!
AH AH SECOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT I CANT FINISH THIS VIDEO OH NOOOOOOOOO
I’m about to cry this was the most amazing and beautiful video I’ve ever seen keep up the good work Thomas 😁😍
This sounds like my life in a nutshell lmao. I can't go anywhere without seeing a cute guy or a cute girl anywhere and then go into hot topic and see someone who's hot and then see them looking at something that I'm into (Like Anime or Pin collecting) and then wanna ask them if they like it, but then chicken out 5 seconds later 😂❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW FOR VIRGILLLLLL OMGGGGGG
If you’ve never witnessed a gay panic at 22:20 there you’ll you shall witness one 😂😂
AWWWWWWWWW THOMMMAAASSSS THIS WAS SOOOOO CUUUTTTTEEE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺  Also I totally would become patreon but I don’t have enough money :c
dose Thomas have a boyfriend eeeeeeee
Me watching a full depth sad movie, hoping to cry: 😐😐 Me watching stuff like this on Youtube: 😭😭
IM SO HAPPY
I wonder what Patton and Logan’s reactions are? 🤔
*Oh my god my heart AAAAAAAHHHHHH*
I LOVE IT SO MUCH, IT'S SO CUTE SJSJJSJ
I cried
Trending has the good stuff
Omg Virgil’s eyeshadow is like a mood ring! Except the ring has two different colors: glittery purple when he’s happy, black when he’s scared or worried. I LOVE IT!!!
"I don't knOw, plant" OMG THAT WAS SO CUTEEEEEE
I’m crying this was so amazing. I’m grinning like an idiot.
I've probably watched this 3 times now and each time I wanna do the patreon more and more, the janus t-shirt looks amazing and I'd love to sign up but I'm not allowed so i gotta wait till I can but then I probably can't get the t
ive been waiting, I was so patient
its here yas
Prinxiety shippers:AAaAaAaa Me not a pro dirty shipper:wut- did I miss something'?
super cute. and if the way he's drawn is any indication the other boy is cute too
ok but im living for the purple sparkle under virge's eyes
*"I'm going to need you to do something with your hands, they're just dangling there."* THE FACT I RELATE SO MUCH TO THAT. My mom always asks me if I'm cold if I have my arms crossed. Sometimes yes.. other times, I just don't know what to do with them so I just cross them. It's not that I'm cold asjdlsujbod
This- I felt this
hello thomas sanders
As someone who still battles with social anxiety, and has been for most of my life, I continue to thoroughly enjoy this animatic. I’ve started to write a book about what it’s like to have it. Keep up the great work, Thomas and his talented friends!
i'm screaming! i loved everything about this video!! the wait was definitely worth it!!!!
Roman: you might just try... and speaking from the heart!       Me: PATTON COME HERE!
THAT WAS ADORABLE I CAN’TTTT 🥺❤️
VIRGILS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE
Prinxiety is true!!!
God if another guy came up to me and spoke to me the way Thomas spoke in the bathroom... god my gay ass would just get up and hug him, and then ask if he wanted me to buy him a drink (like a milkshake or something)
We didn’t see Patton, Logan, Janus, or Remus and they literally did nothing in this video. But I feel like them doing nothing speaks VOLUMES
Is this a true story or fake i just wanna know
I just want to say that the TIMING and the RELATABILITY of this video are AMAZING. The place where Nico takes the bag of carrots and tells Thomas not to waste this opportunity if you listen to the music it just times PERFECTLY. (You have no idea how many times I have been SO hecking angry when the timing of music was off.) And the relatability of all the thoughts and actions of Thomas is just SO relatable. THANK YOU. Social problems cause a lot of chaos in my life, so thank you a lot for this. :3 PS: THE VOICE ACTING IS THE BEST THING EVER.
Thomas: Nothing But a bruised ego Roman: Hm..  I FRICKING LOVED THIS SO MUCHHHH AND THE WAY VIRGIL LOOKED AT ROMAN AND HELPED HIM OUT AHHHHHH
Love the purple under eye look for virgil
People, Think about this...   What if this is Thomas’ Way to...   TELL US HOW HE MEET HIS NEW BOYFRIEND?       LIKE THINK ABOUT IT! This is just- yes. I hope this is “based on a true story”
Still his vines are probably some of the best vines out there
I love this series so much would it be possible to do another animation please?
I only just realised that Thomas really sounds like Ryan Reynolds sometimes
This made me indescribably happy
"You saw me knock over that trash can didn't you?" "THAT WAS YOU!"
PRINXIETY
Virgil had black eye-shadow in the ending meaning he was nervous or scared of something..
Thomas: uploads this everyone: haha prinxiety go brrr
excited Virgil is so cute with his sparkly purple eyeshadow!!! I just want to see my anxious boy happy
man they really have 5 microphones and 0 braincells lmao
THE PRINXIETY INSIDE OF THIS BUS IS ASTRONOMICAL I LOVE IT
I love it
Coming into this, I was expecting all the sides to flirt with Virgil for 20 minutes, and I was so excited
First time here and lovely thing
AWE CUTE
#9 on trending? Omg congrats Thomas!! You deserve it! Its amazing!! 🥺💕
*Happy Fangirl Noises*
Anybody else feel like this video further proves this series could be a cartoon/anime?
Thomas's speech in the bathroom had me ALL the way in my feelings 😭😍
problem is... that if thomas starts a relationship, then anxiety is going to be less active because been nervous all the time in a relationship is not healthy
OMG this is like SO cute <3 I really loved the drawing format
Awwwwh exited Virgil li so cute!
22:50 I love Virgil. The look of joy in and on his eyes is so pure. I'm so happy right now.
Virgil, got new eyeshadow!
please do more of these!! that was amazing!!!
bro virgil's eye shadow changing colors with his mood is so hecking CLEVER!!! I love the sparkly purple!!
Ok. so I know NOTHING about this fandom. All I know is that is THIS WAS SO WHOLESOME. I wanna say that this is so relatable, but I know nothing about seeing someone and having my mind just go nuts.
tesla model 3
BRO VIRLGIL ROMAN U NEED TO BE COUPLE Ur both so cute together!
me be like: ROMAN AND VIRGIL ARE WORKING TOGETHER!!!! AND THEY WERE GETTING ALONG!!! i loved that ending SO much!!! great job Thomas!!
Who HASN'T been through this- XD
In case no one told you today👀👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽:  You’re beautiful🙂.  You’re loved💕.  You’re needed🤗.  You're amazing😁.  You’re stronger than you think💪🏼.  Never give up on your dreams🙌!  Please show some love 💕to a small channel 👀👍🏼🙂

OMG did anyone else notice how at the end when virgil got back to the house his under eye shadow turned shiney!!!!!! That is the cutiest idea!
THIS WAS SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oh my gosh that was so cute!
This made me stim so hard I hurt my wrist
In case no one told you today👀👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽:  You’re beautiful🙂.  You’re loved💕.  You’re needed🤗.  You're amazing😁.  You’re stronger than you think💪🏼.  Never give up on your dreams🙌!  Please show some love 💕to a small channel 👀👍🏼🙂
Defo a couple of benders
How did i miss this
AAAAAHHHHHHH MY GAY SIGN IS TINGLING  and it's adorable
Can I please get a part 2, like, first date? <3
I relate to this way too much.
My anxiety was high throughout this whole video 😂
Oooo Virgil's eyeshadow changes to purple when he's really happy? I like that.  Also cuuuuUUUUTEEEE!!!
That soliloquy ending at 14:21...  I was confused about why Virgil chose after then to be the time to call out Thomas' lying and sneaking.  Why was Roman exactly as suspicious at the same time?   Is this how Janus got them to fall for him?  Or do I need to rest an overworked brain?
“Shut up Emo”
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW THO IS AMAAZING VIRGIL
*Me realizing that it'll probably be another 6 or more months until the live action-*
NO U NO!!
I love this more than life itself
aaaawww Virgil my boiiii 🥺🥺😭😭😭
The prinxiety shippers are goin crazy
The end... it seems like Virgil may be scarred from a toxic relationship Thomas may have been in.   Also, I love it how, when Virgil is happy and in a decent mood, he has PURPLE eyeshadow!!!!
‌
I love this. This is so adorable
10:57 I felt that. So much. Too much.
'Pintrovert' is now in my vocabulary and my life is forever changed.
Relatable.
What were the lies he was telling himself? the plant, the food, reference that Virgil was talking about. was there a moral i was supposed to figure out?
More ads then tv
Can we talk about how when Roman told Virgil to relax Virgil snaps- like I could be wrong but this is like this first time he's actually yelled-
I love seeing them all so happy. I know that some crap has been going on for the Sides, but they're doing okay, guys. I'm happy for Thomas, I hope Mico is real because I love him. Roman is excited, I've never seen Virgil so happy. This is good.
"Hate to rain on your black parade, GeRaRd GaY"
This was so cute! I loved it so so much!
Normal people watching the end of the animation: aw Thomas got with the guy and it’s good to know Roman and Virgil are FRIENDS     Prinxiety shippers: *heavy breathing*
Omg this is so cute, all of it, so cute.
Virgil at the end card telling Thomas to do all these things because he's nervous/excited is such a mood. "You need to take a walk, yeah thank you that helps" "do you have to pee, you sure?" "Flap your hands, just flap them they're hanging there doing nothing" Like honestly, I felt like doing the same. Sometimes if you're overwhelmed you just gotta MOVE and get it all out
OMG YOU'RE TRENDING IVE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD IM CRYINGGG <3
virgil making thomas so happy stims/whatever it may be- it’s so perfect- i love it- maybe virgil will slowly be in control of the anxiety and will grow to branch out into greater feelings!!
22:21 for the adorable endcard
Anyone else here because of ABDIllustrates?... because I am...
"well, let's not waste this one" are you kiDDING SO GOSH HECKIN CUTE
ABD-Illustrates!!!!! Ahhhh!!!
That are we ready for this at the end ahhhhh. This guy was flirting with me (idek if I'm attracted to guys at this point) and I really really am not ready for this sort of attention what am I supposed to d0
Wait...is Nico a real person???
ex x x pert.... heh.
this made my heart so warm i just watched it twiceee
wailers unformulated
I love this so much i got so excited my iner patton made me have a heart attack 😂 i love it soooo much omg
Thomas commented under my recent video 🔌
Uh, cool.  Anyway, check this out!  https://youtu.be/IgnVYOEYdfo
No one: Me to me: shut up emo
I come back from my Dad's to find this *and* the new Starkid project?? I'm in heaven! Edit: OMG THE PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END I'M LOSING MY MIND, HE'S SO HAPPY I CAN'T 😊
I like the detail on the changing eyeshadow.
H o w d a r e u c a l l m e o u t l i k e t h a t
Oh my stars I love all the puns! This is so cute!🤩
I'm surprised no ones talking about the new Eye shadow Virgil had at the end of the episode. It's purple and Sparkly but you also see him go back to the regular eye shadow at some moments as well
Um, so this is just me when I met my boyfriend- TvT god I’m gay- I had to look at his bag to see if he was gay—
Is he gay or European?
Alternative title: me and the prinxiety shippers squealing for 24 minutes and 13 seconds gay
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
This comment is a little all over the place so if it goes from topic to topic don't mind it. I watched the new episode yesterday and can I just say the Voice actors and the animators did such an amazing job. I saw the episode yesterday in my recommendations and started crying of excitement, along with the end where we got that little clip of you saying are we ready for this I started crying of happiness from all the development that had happened in the episode and would be happening soon. Just seeing this episode along with prinxiety which was the first ship I ever started shipping in the sander sides fandom and seeing how Roman and Virgil's relationship with each other has blossomed so much throughout the series made me fangirl a bit (okay a lot). Also can I just say, that purple eye shadow which I'm assuming stands for excitement when Virgil is happy is so good, It also made me fangirl a bit more. I had to pause every now and then just to calm down my excitement and think about all of this. This is getting so long so I'll stop here. Keep up the great work Thomas, Voice actors, and animators, and editors!
Cue me, grinning like an idiot rn
Thomas out here really fuelling the prinxiety shippers huh-
I WANNA HEAR MORE ABOUT NIKO
Why does this make me feel that Thomas actually ships prinxiety 🤣
IM CRYING!! this was amazing it brought me to tears :,) I love this so much!!!
Thomas: *Calls roman a punk*  MCU/Stucky fans: *Heavy breathing*
When Roman called Virgil emo  my heart just like exploded. But also gay love is so cute!!!
“Hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay” I-
This was amazing! The story line had brought tears to my eyes multiple times. Keep up the great work! ^^
IS IT CANON, IS ROMAN X VIRGIL CANON WTF
VIRGIL IS DOUBTING IF THOMAS IS ACTUALLY READY... AND THAT PLOTPOINT WILL STRIKE LIKE A HURRICANE EVERYTHING FOR THE NEXT EPISODE-
Is nobody going to talk about how Virgil's eye-shadow is purple when he's like overly excited please I think that's adorable
We need more Virgil fangirling over successful social interactions
Anyone notice at the very end Virgil’s eye shadow was bright shiny purple then it went back to normal
THOMAS I AM SOOOOO PROUD
This was really interesting. The animatic format allowed for things that couldn't be done in live action (multiple sides on the same screen, physical interaction, an environment outside of his home/mind-space, etc).
How dare you make an entire video about gay panicking and not make ONE IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN REFERENCE
Who else saw this and imedietly clicked on it❤❤❤I love this series so was so excited when saw it ❤❤❤
ahahahhaha imagine me having money to join the Patreon hahahaha...
reminds me of the gay minecraft youtubers UwU
AHHHHHHH HIS EYE FREAKING SHADOWWWWWW-
I'M SCREAMING THIS IS SO CUTE I LOVE THIS AAAAAAAA
I don’t generally like romance centered stories but this can be the one singular exception to that.
I'm so happy there is another sanders side video🤗
NOT ME WATCHING THIS FOR THE 5th TIME ALREADY
No one is talking about the eyeshadow ejskdksjd
Virgil: Shut up Roman: Shut up Me: SHUT UP
Happy Virgil= Purple shiny eyeshadow Super Anxious Virgil=Black eyeshadow 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ENDING WITH ROMAN AND VIRGIL WTFFFFFFFFFFFF AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I let out a squeal!! Good for you Thomas!! Also amazing production from the whole crew, as per usual 💕💕💕
This was a emotional rollercoaster and I loved it😂!And the animation was quality!👌🏽
MY HEART ♥️
I love what you did to Virgil!!how when he is anxious his eye shadow turns black but when he is happy or brave it goes purple!x
Prixiety confirmed 😍  Also it’s so adorable that when Virgil is excited his eyeshadow is purple
Have anyone noticed that Virgil's eyebrow is changing colors from purple to black?
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW!?!?!! What does this mean? When he gets excited it turns purple, is this a visual queue that he’s becoming more of a light side? Either way it’s freaking fabulous!
I SAW THE HEARTS ROMAN, I SAW THEM.
Yes ship
Does someones eye shadow change depending on how energized they feel? 👀👀👀
Prinxiety is now confirmed. OH MY GOD. I am literally shaking of just pure joy with how this video came out. like OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD. I also took the time to type out the words oh my god instead of omg and multiple times. That is how excited and overfilled with joy right not. Ok, I need to breathe. Ok, I'm gonna be ok and I just gotta breathe..... Ok, I think I'm good now.
BTW I really love the detail the used for virgil's eyeshadow I wasn't obiously expecting that but I really love it and maybe this means because Thomas is evolving as a character on being more mature and stuff this also affects virgil's character well it affects all the characters but I guess this is good thing
Knowing that the conflict of most Sanders Asides videos seem to be a metaphor for an internal conflict of a Side, the prinxIETY CHARTS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF-
Okay so is Thomas....ya know.....*hand flop*?
Omg this was so cuuuuuute!!!!
Who else thought this video was going to be of people flirting with anxiety? I read the title and was like "This is interesting". XD
N e v a d a  A n a c o n d a  *me who didnt know these have wide vowels* 👁👄👁
NOT ME CRYING AND REWATCHING THE END OVER AND OVER
Shakey hands stim!!!!!!!
THIS IS AMAZING
Roman: what are you doing??  Thomas: I don't know... plant  Roman: stop being fake with the plastic plant and start being real with him.  me: mood
Ok so- I love every single thing about this but- did anyone else notice how Virgil's eyeshadow changes with his emotions? Thomas if you ever see this, that's so freaking cool, and also kind of heartbreaking cause before this episode we've only ever seen Virgil's black eyeshadow, meaning he's never been excited or happy(?) Since we've met him. I also love that, this talking to this guy made him that happy, to the point that he forgot all of his worries until he was home, and then when he had a worry, he forgot it again as soon as they started talking about him again, that's freaking adorable. Plus, we love Roman and Virgil getting along and being friendly- by friendly I mean actually smiling at each other and being sweet (don't come at me Prinxiety shippers 😂) anyway, this was amazing and I just- 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
The gay panic is so real
I cried- THIS WAS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭
virgil: you could live like jack and sally if you want  my dumb ass: was that a blink-182 reference?
Roman: pats virgil's shoulder prinxiety shippers: write that down. *WRITE THAT DOWN.*  *holy cow I didn't think I'd get that many likes*
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG DHAHSYGWKWJ I LOVE THIS SOOOOOOO MUCH MY HEART I CAN'T EVEN- OK I'M GONNA GO RE-WATCH IT A THOUSAND TIMES MORE 💜💜💜
Why can’t this happen to me?? Also I really felt Virgils anxiousness...I want this so bad 😭❤️
EXCITED VIRGIL IS THE CUTEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IM KGFYKDJGFKHCKYROYFJLV
"I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" my emo self is SHAKING 😂😂
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? "Idk plant"
WATCHING THIS AGAIN AND SCREAMINGGFF AAAAAHHHHHHHH
This one was soooo uncomfy and sooooo precious at the same time!!!! (BEAUTIFUL artwork like OMG!!)
Roman touching virgils shoulder Me: *fan-human-ing to the best of my ability Thomas talking about the patreon  Me:*hitting my hands on my bed* I need it I need it I need it I need it I need it I need it I need 25 dollars
Virgil’s eye shadow at the end keeps changing! Whenever they point out something concerning it changes back to black, and when the mood lightens again it goes back to being the pretty iridescent purple! I would also like to point out that at approximately 9:34 in the video, Roman calls Virgil by his actual name.   No teasing or wacky nickname, just “Virgil” and I think that’s a wonderful little detail.   (Ro) MAN I loved this episode!!!
My YouTube betrayed me!!! I didn't get the notification! T~T  Well at least I can watch this now because recommendations knows me well... sometimes too well.
*wants to join patreon but doesn't have enough money to do so because my job doesn't pay well enough*
Ooo I love the purple eyeshadow
When virgil was happy at the beginning of the end card his eyeshadow was PURPLE??!?!?
My goodness I felt that gay panic.
I would just like to publicly document the fact that my cat likes watching sanders sides with me
It was fantastic
So...Janus now runs Thomas' patreon
I didn’t get any ads... the gay panic transcends all.
I want to join! But I’m broke! This video made me see the love that I’ve never really had for Princiety. I can’t wait for more of this
VERGILS EYESHADOWS COLOUR CHANGE IS MARVELOUS
So is Prinxiety canon yet? 👀
okay okay okay b u T-  my d.i.d probably talking here but am I the only one who does this to -
I thought I lost my ability to emote and feel anything in the past days.. Weeks.... Months? And yet watching Thomas struggle to talk to a cute guy at the food court and almost missing the opportunity- Somehow made me feel so alive.... Thank you. To the entire crew. I really do hope Nico sticks around.
"No I wasnt testing you, I was just paniking :)" ... "No THE UNIVERSE TESTED YOU!!"
... oml I loved this so much! It was really close to how I met one of my friends which makes me extremely happy to see it done like this!  ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 Remember, you guys only got one life so if you see someone you like, don't be afraid. The worst they could say is, "Sorry, I have to go." And it's not all that bad, be proud of yourself for talking to them. 💜💙💜💙
I have a question if you don't mind but could we possibly heave more information on virgil's backstory?.....            ....if possible?
I thought Thomas said gay ICE and I thought he was gonna buy Nico a rainbow snow cone.    Both interpretations (eyes and ice) are equally as funny to me-
22:35 I only now realized virgils eyeshadow was a metallic like purple then a few moments later back to black. Maybe excitment?
not me actually crying at "let's not waste this one."
"gay eyes", more like "gay"ze (gaze)  also i heard "trash bag" instead of "trash bin" when he was talking about his song & expected him to be like "feeling like a trash bag, drifting through the wind, wanting to start again"
Virgil and Roman beat up Thomas emotionally for a while.
this is perfect!! i loved it to pieces =)
This is epic!!!!!
You nearly brought a tear to my eye near the end there. 🙂
virgil has purple eyeshadow now and I want it to stay that way
virgil has purple eyeshadow now and I want it to stay that way
AWWWW- i love this so muchhhh, its so Cute!!🤧🤧😊😊😊👌👌👌😤😤😤✨
I wonder if Virgil is worried he's setting Roman up to fail after Thomas asks if they are ready for this in the end card...
The shaking hands and pacing!!!!!!
23:25 "Join me! No thinking"
The other sides while at the mall: Logan's at Barnes n Noble Patton's at Build a Bear Remus is at Victoria's Secret- (In my opinion) Remy is at Starbucks  If you see this please help me with where Janus and Emile go to-  Edit: Thanks for the likes guys, gals, and non-binary pals <3
Thomas you are a gift from God
WHY DO I NOT GET NOTIFIED ANYTIME ANYONE POST THIS IS SO CUTE!!!!
Prinxiety fans, are you all okay? Remember to breathe and not faint. WE ARE ALL YOU RIGHT NOW! Also....Virgil becoming brave changes his eye shadow?....I have a lot of questions
👀
esto pasaría muy bien como un corto animado lgntq+ sin problemas ❤️❤️❤️
this video: .... me: pRiNxIeTy (i don’t even think i spelled that right but we’re gonna ignore that)
Aight Thomas, when’s the next date...
Roman: *sad* Virgil: NOPE NOT TODAY *pushes Thomas forward*
My favourite nickname that Roman has ever used on Virgil is "Gerard Gay"
This video is just me everyday while seeing normal people
This is amazing!!!!!!
I think this is one of my favorite videos so far, I love seeing Virgil that happy <3
I’m sorry but- is no one talking about how when Virgil got all giddy and excited his eyeshadow turned purple and when he got worried or nervous it turned black at the end
That was so cute. I'm cryiiiing.
THIS IS 15 ON TRENDING LMAO-
OMG i loved this and can realte much👁👄👁✨💖
Thomas are you trying to give us heart attacks?!  FIRST PATTON IN A SKIRT ON INSTAGRAM  THEN THIS  AND INSIDE THIS THERES PRINXIETY  AND *VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW*
This introverted bi just now realized that she ABSOLUTELY uses the pins and stickers system. I feel both seen and called out! Also, this was so fun and adorable! I would definitely watch more animated asides if y'all ever want to do more of them, but I'd also love to see a classic live-action performance of this one as well when it's safe to do so! <333
I started to cry and felt so many feelings watching this. I also love seeing it as an animatic!!!!!
The whole episode reminds me of the song gay or European
Roman: (HAND ON VIRGILS SHOULDER) *gay eyes*  Virgil: * BLUSHED AT HIM ahahahahahaahah
This is Beautiful I’ve watch this for 10 hours now
16:00 GAY PANIC
This is just me trying to make friends in college 'cause I heard them talking about something I really like but then my anxiety being a coward and saying No <3
haven't heard that intro in a while
This is so cute 🥺
Can we also please talk about Virgil’s hard breathing before taking a chance at happiness, but when he sees Roman so sad he does it anyways.... like 😍😘🥺😖 THOMAS PLEASE REENACT THIS IN REAL LIFE WHEN YOU CAN! I beg of you 😫😣 ITS A MASTERPIECE full of gayness and princy x emo boi
Dodkksjeoskdnsj the old jokes-
*roman touches virgil's shoulder* Me: *heavily breathing and squealing*
Virgil: XXXPERT  Roman: Easy tiger  Me: *Inhales* _SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE_
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY-
I’m sorry, but that was the MOsT PRINCEANXITY video I’ve ever seen especially the last part of the animation also did we all notice the changing eyeshadow we he got anxious and then got excited instead like from dark black to glittery purple. IM IN LOVE! Thank you so much Thomas,  this is what I’ve been waiting for, also sorry I know it’s weird to basically ship him with himself, but you know... whatever 🏳️‍🌈PRINCY AND EMO 🖤💜+❤️
The amount of times I have screamed with excitement was literally majority of the video!!
I love this so friggin much
Its an amazing animatic but it looks like roman and virgil are trying to annoy thomas
VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW IS EVERYTHING
this is so wholesome, i love it
Does anyone else notice Virgil's eye shadow change back and forth between purple and black?
This has brought me unlimited joy
15:45 I keep thinking they’re talking about Janus here. Is it fair to Janus to make him deal with all of Thomas’s problems? He needs a break too.
the calm before the storm
The title and thumbnail had me thinking this was gonna be a vid about Roman flirting with Virgil 😅🤦‍♀️    ^^ But was I really wrong tho?
How was virgil ever a villain in this series he’s so fucking cuuuuutttte
it was at this moment 12:42 i came to realize that Virgil and Roman share half a brain cell and Logan and Patton have the rest of them.
Success tips:-“You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth.”
Let's see who is intelligent here.. What gets wetter the more it dries?
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG 17:09 VIRGIL DOESN’T WANT ROMAN TO FEEL SAD! OMG OMG OMG OMG I AM FANGIRLING SO HARD RIGHT NOW
Hm... could be gayer ;P
Oh man, perfect timing! I'm trying to get along with with this guy from work which, somehow, I might hav a crush on him after appraoching me a couple of times. It's exciting yet scary. I think this helps. Thank you, Thomas! Hope you'll be able to create more content soon! I know how hard it is, what with everything going on.   PS: Is t just me, or is this a mistake that Virgil's eye shadow keeps changing.
Only at the half way point but I already love this SO much. I would love if there were some more animated videos in the future (obvs I know that this takes very long to make, so no pressure)
Everyone’s all like “Awww this was awesome uwu so good” And it was I really love animation But   *Did Remus seriously smash a plate on his head XD i love it lol*
THIS IS SO CUTE, I LOVE ROMAN AND VIRGIL
Oh my god Virgil was giving Roman gay eyes at the end 😂😌
Did anybody notice that when Virgil worries his eyeshadow is black but when he’s excited it’s a pretty shade of purple? agreed!
I love how virgils eye shadow is purple when he is happy and black when he is normal
Omg Tomas has a new bf?? 👏👏👏👏
So we're not gonna talk about Virgil's panic attack when Roman and Thomas we're sad?
Nico's voice reminded me of Carlos from Welcome To Night Vale, he sounds like he has fantastic hair.
this better have happened in real life, or I am going to kill myself.
I think its always been clear that Virgil is fight or flight, so in this scenario, his bravery is "fight"
also what is happening with Virgil’s eyeshadow
I missed my dark strange son 🖤🖤
AAAAAAAAAA!!!
i related way too much to this video
Bruh this is very cute 🥺🥺 mah heart
Instead of patreon, how about pattreon and Patton runs it
Prinxiety is real
Top of the morning to ya   Me: jacksepticeye
Okie i'm happy everyone's getting along and BOI AM I HAPPY THOMAS FINALLY MET SOMEONE- But like- is virgil ok? He looked like he was having second thoughts about a relationship- Thank  you sooooooo much for giving us this blessed Series!!!
Abd draws A B D D R A W S
I’m watching this in Virgil cosplay
yusssss
Why is Virgil’s eyeshadow going from purple to it’s usual greyish-black each time he’s on the screen..?
The entire video: *gay panic*
oh...I didn't realize I am a pintrovert
:( I begged my dad to buy one of the things from your Patreon but he said no :(
please tell me I'm not the only one who is thinking that Virgil's eyeshadow changing between purple and black is an addictional thing to the theory that he his a neutral side while the other six (counting with the last that still haven't show up) are kind off oposittes  i don't know, I just thought about it and now I'm overthinking about it
i love abd illustrates im so glad he worked on this, he makes wonderful sandersides artworks!
This was so adorable that I started tearing up a little.
THOMAS IM BROKE DX
Virgil said ✨✨✨✨✨✨💜
Oh my gosh! An episode concept of Thomas talking to the Sides OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE!!!
PRINXIETY
Did anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow kept switching between purple and black?
19:55 I NEED THIS IN LIVE ACTION
Creep by radiohead reference!
I'm not the only one that's see hearts near Roman right 19:58 I see prinxiety XD
Does no one realize that when Virgil is happy his dark circles become purple omg so cute
“Idk plant”    I DIED
Virgel’s eye shadow is sparkly purple now!!!        Good upgrade my friend
Wait y didnt I get the notif for this? YouTube is homophobic 😔
Yes.
I have a bit of a theory kinda?  I think the reason that Roman doesn’t like the dark sides is because the stereotypes in movies and films. The normal stereotype is the hero gets the girl and the villain loses. When you watch a Disney princess movie, you know that the bad guy is always going to lose no matter what. In Roman’s case, the dark sides are the “bad guys” and the light sides are the “good guys”. The reason Roman is less open to them and hates them is because that’s what the good guys feel about the bad guys. When Virgil and Janus become a part of the group, both times Roman started off with a bad relationship. For Virgil, Roman kept making fun of him and the other light sides are okay with him. For Janus, the same thing, but this times they are separating kinda. The sort of separating that you and someone else with sides. But Roman doesn’t think that is supposed to happen and that all the good guys are supposed to work together and all the bad guys have to work together as well. I’m not sure if it’s a good theory or not but if you want to add on to it you can say it in the reply section if you like!
I absolutely love this💜
(๑•ᴗ•๑)♡
i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay, but-  is THE funniest thing I have ever heard
This is one of my absolute favorite videos, it made me laugh so much, it was super cute!!<3
Everyone is talking about Virgil and Roman but what about the guy in the bathroom The pore guy got so heart broken when he found out that Tomas was not taking to him  1like = some love
You cant convince me those moments between virgil and Roman WEREN'T gay. Also did he change the eyeshadow for virgil? I think he did.
This was perrrrrfect
I hope you can do a video for halloween!! That would be awesome!
Yess
prinxiety shippers: THE SHIP IS SALING  This was amazing and I love it
is this the michael to thomas’s jeremy?
if it was THAT easy to find a partner at the mall i wouldnt be single rn😭😭
I love how Virgil's makeup changes when he thinks about Nico!!!
I feel called out; I’m the stranger wooed in the bathroom 😂😂😂
please recreate just for the three thomases in a trash can please
Virgls eyeshadow at the end
Y'all ever heard of second-hand embarrassment? Lol
Cool episode, Thomas! May there be a happy future for you! ; )
QwQ amazing
Ngl, when Virgil pulled up his hood and said he was freaking out I screamed "NU MY BABY"
Virgil: no man  Roman: no it’s with an “r” Me: rnoman 👁👄👁
Thomas: nothing but a bruised ego. Roman: HmMMmM
Frick this is CUTE
screams in prinxiety
OMG it was lovely! :'D 💕✨
This episode has me crying ngl-
How did I miss this
Wait wait WAIT! when virge is happy does his eyeshadow go purple!?!? That's adorable.
Istg he just confirmed prinxiety 😂
Why is NO ONE talking about how Roman basically made a bunch of dad jokes (or at least bad puns) in a row? Patton would be proud Edit: Holy cow, 518 likes in less than a day. That's a new record that I was _not_ expecting at all. Thanks guys :> Edit #2: 900 and something likes?! Okay, thank you, really, but wHAT THE ACTUAL F-
I’VE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS SO MUCH RECENTLY I KEEP SEEING REALLY CUTE GIRLS AND I JUST /AAAAAAAAA/
Sooo adorable!!!!!
Mini heart attac just there I thought there was no more Thomas without paying for patreon
This has been my favorite video so far 💜💜💜
Hmm yes the gay panic is real in this one
JOAN ❤️
this is so cute
22:24 that's when purple eyeshadow virgil comes
interesting how virgil doesn’t call janus by the name janus and continues to call him deceit
I swear I was trying so hard to not scream the whole time that I barely breathed
I loved this video so much x Ligit made me so happy
Love this ❤️❤️❤️
I loved this video so much x Ligit made me so happy
I know I'm overthinking it and it's probably because he did it quickly and because of covid going on, but has anyone else noticed that Roman doesn't have his signature black shirt on under his princely overall. That couldn't have been comfortable for Thomas to wear without a shirt on underneath, surely all the seems would be irritating his skin. I am overthinking it aren't I.
Soooo cute and wholesale
10:07 oh my god
Me:*just learning there is a ship called prixiety*  Me: 'why isn't it called Verman?'
17:10 thank you! This part was amazing and so real! Like I can relate to anxiety pushing you to go ahead and do it. 🥰
wAIT IS THOMAS ACTUALLY DATING SOMEONE
That. Ending. Tho!!!!  This was great thomas! Keep up the amazing work and remember to stay safe!!
This makes me feel like this was a Pixar short film. So fancy.
Story time  Recently I've been trying to sort out my anxiety. So I started expressing my style more, now I'm getting more confident and then suddenly I saw a cute girl yesterday then I went up to her and straight up told her I thought that she was hot 🙃😅😅🖤🌸
Thomas got a date~~
live-action!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the fact that this is currently 12th in trending shows how much exited the fanders are about this
OMG this is SO SWEET I'll cry!!!
"Is he... Y'know-" 💅💅
Why am I laughing so hard- I love my precious bois (who are like twice my age or something-) The buttons scene though. "You have 5 seconds max." "Wha- I'm not Max! I'm Prince Ro-" " *_GO!_* " "Ah, no, no, no, gay, no, no- gay? *GAY!* "
Yay finally a new video 🙂🙂🙂🙂
I love the gay panick
Finalyyyyyyyyyyyyy and yes I wrote this before he said finally
AAAAAWWWW!
HIS EYESHADOQ IS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thomas have you seen all the gacha and other videos related to the Sides? I swear- I mean who wouldn't make videos on them? The Sides are *iconic*
Yes another sanders sides! I love you so much! Keep it up, you are very good at it.
I'm sorry but *_Virge's face when he says "Pins" though-_*
there's no lips to read and no subtitles yet someone help
If possible, I beg of the Sanders Sides crew to make another one of these animatic episodes with Logan and Patton. Maybe after a few dates and Thomas is considering a serious relationhip with Nico. *We need more*
This is probably one of the most sweetest and most considerate patreon advertisements I’ve ever heard, and I’m living for it.
Virgil:You gonna break the heart Roman! Me:OH SHOOT HE’S RIGHT IF THE GUY BREAKS THOMAS HEART PATTONS GONNA BE A MESS AGAIN-!  Also me:But—
I mean thats one way to put the panic in gay panic
V I R G I L  I MISSED Y O U
I'm about to confess to my crush tomorrow and this gave me the boost of courage I so desperately needed! Thank you so much!!! The art in this episode was absolutely lovely <3
I lost it at Gerard Gay! *applause* Props to all ya'll
THE ENDING MADE ME SQUEAL HOLY SH-   this was sooooooooo cute x3 (also lowkey relatable)
22:37 ...was virgil blushing purple?...thats adorable omg
I have a couple theories about why Virgil was being rude to Patton in the Sanders A Sides healthy distractions. I think since Patton was nice to Janus when he showed up Virgil was afraid that either Janus would hurt Patton and he was maybe trying to help prepare Patton for a let down. Or he was afraid that Patton would choose Janus over him and he was trying to push away Patton before he got hurt. Because of the events in SVS redux how Virgil sees it is that Patton has chosen Janus
When Virgil's eyeshadow turned back to black 🥺 he only had like 30 seconds of happiness
that was so freaking cute
Why is this so true to me, other than that DID VIRGIL CHANGE HIS EYESHADOW!!!
I  definitely a pintover 🤣
i feel personally attacked
WE GOT WHAT WE WANTED, THOMAS GAVE US WHAT WE WANTED, THE ART IS AMAZING, THE FRIGGIN PRINXIETY MOMENTS, THE HEARTOUCHING MOMENTS, THE GREAT VOICE ACTING, CUTE GAY MOMENTS, VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THOMAS GOT WHAT HE WANTED. HE SEEMS HAPPY. OMFG EVERYBODY SAY THANK YOU TO THOMAS FOR ALL THE FANGIRLING AND JOY. THOMAS, YOURE AND ANGEL. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS EVERYONE, HALLELUJAH, THANK YOU, AND GOOD NIGHT.
I just noticed at the end how Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing depending on his emotions. As always, the attention to detail is incredible. I love this series!🥰
I had to pause right after the pin-scan and I started thinking, what if he isn't gay and it's actually an Incan flag? And then I return and his name is Nick López!? Needless to say, I panicked.
I love the radiohead refrence at 6:49  Virgil: "you're a creep." Virgil: "you're a weirdo." Virgil: "what the hell are we doing here?
YOUR OTP COULD NEVER MATCH THIS
Priiiiiinnnxiiiiietyyyyyyy
I CAN'T TAKE IT- SO MUCH PRINXIETY- I LOVE IT AAAHHH
OH MY GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M A DAY LATE- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG AND KEPT CHECKING THOMAS' TWITTER POSTS AND I STILL MISSED IT-
YEAS
Did anyone notice how virgils eyeshadow changed because he was happy-
I can't tell if this story is purely fiction or if it's based on a real story, but dang I just want my boy Thomas to find his own Disney prince and be happy
Finallyyyyy I found a YouTuber that 1: I like 2: he’s gay like me U~U But I’m lesbian- Maybe bisexual- Idk yet Edit: ok I might be asexual-
I have missed a lot of Thomas. Deceit has a name? Asides? Out of touch for sure lol.
AHHHHH THIS WAS SO CUUTEEEEE 💜💜💜💜
The ending made me so happy holy hell I’m so giddy rn
I’m getting some MAJOR left brain, right brain vibes     And I LOVE IT!!!
i am SHAKING
Prinxiety shippers be squealing.
I still can’t get over the purple eyeshadow at the end— (annnnnnd now I’m happy crying- well crap-)
Virgil advising Thomas on what he can do to work off excess nerves???? Working TOGETHER to deal with it?? I love it so much
Roman is a certified himbo and im here for it
I ship Joan and thomas
I’m smiling like an idiot
The "liar" scene reminds me alot of the new years lies song from a while back lol
PURPLE EYESHADOW OMG
Hold up hold up hold up.  Roman said to speak from the *heart*        And then Thomas goes on an angst train Is Patton okay?
Oh my gosh this episode was amazing
22:20 here's the end card so you dont have to scroll through thw whole VID to find it
I relate to that last scene with Roman looking sad and Virgil pushing Thomas.  My anxiety sometimes pushes me to do things I might not.  Guilt often times pushes me to actually talk to the person I fought with, and that’s related to my anxiety.
ive never really seen a sanders sides before (i know of them and they seem the best!) but i love animatics and this is the best thing ive ever seen!! its so well done and adorable you can tell a bunch of work and love went into it
IM SO FRICKING HAPPY IM ABOUT TO CRY!!!💜❤
That was beautiful❣️  Omg wow i love the EVERYTHING 😂😂
The whole time I was watching this the social anxiety side was pulling on my heart strings lol
My second hand embarrassment can't-
Most beautiful script that I've ever stumbled upon! The emotions, were really real. It was heart-warming, sincere, filled with courage. I can't hold my tears on that. It was sooo beautiful! Thanks for the animation. It was perfect!😍😊❤️👌
"Shuttup Emo" lol I'm dead
when viergal optimistic his eyeliner turns purple? Or am reading too far into the eyeliner?
THOMAS! BE CAREFUL! YOU'RE FUELING THE SHIPPERS!
OMG THAT'S FREAKING ADORABLE
the prinxiety is strong in this one
I had no idea that’s how us gays are supposed to communicate. I need to pay more attention. First things first, I’m gonna buy myself some pride flag stationary and next... uhhh look for Disney related things? I need help with this 😬
Me: hmmmmm  I just wanna know have you seen are ships or is this just like a really good friendship I just gotta know  I personally ship roman X Virgil ... Pat X Jan ... Logi X remes ...  I mean I know there all parts of you but it's so cute.
OMG NEW VIDEO YESSS
Roman: You talk to him Virgil: No Man! Roman: Ah it Roman, with an R  This is like a very Roman act
i. im just. i have so much to say. but i dont know how. i hdhdbcbdhjd.
OH MY HEART
This is so incredible, Thomas! I doubt you’ll see this, but I came out to my dad as ace a little over a week ago and it actually went okay 😊 This completely depicts what goes on in my mind when I’m placed with the dilemma of not knowing if someone is expecting more than I’m comfortable with. I’m also extremely introverted and I never take risks, so I’ve always been afraid of being in a relationship (I’m only 15 and never even dated anyone), but I always think about the future and get really scared. You’ve helped me through so much the past few years, but also side notes, THE DETAIL WITH VIRGILS EYESHADOW AT THE END BEING DARK IN CERTAIN OVERLY ANXIOUS MOMENTS, BUT LIGHT PURPLE IN THE GOOD ANXIETY MOMENTS AHHHHHHHH
Oh my god I loved this sooo much!
Omg. I can't express how much I love that video.  It hits very close to home, because I tend to waste opportunities like this and regret it over and over again. 😅 I just love this so much. Keep up the good work and good luck with your patreon!
I never thought of the gay eyes thing till I caught myself doing that over the summer but none the less this video was amazing and adorable I love Thomas so much and seeing him and roman and virgil again made me happy
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING GIVES ME LIFE
Also THIS IS SO CUUUUUUUUTE
I had to re-watch this because it was so awesome. I loved it so much.
Hes here!!! Yay
4:14  My dirty mind made me fascinate a lot. Forgive my dirty mind🤭🤭🤭🤭

Virgil acting as Thomas‘ nervous system at the end had me rolling
Thank you Thomas for being an amazing creater who I go to, to relax and ur bids really help me with my problems ur the best! ❤️
I.... F****NG LOVE IT! It's so cute and sad and happy and everything at the same time! Boy... I feel it... I feel it so much... I'm actually crying right now it's hard to see what I'm writing so I can only hope it's correct.  I LOVE YOU! (platonically)
THAT WAS SO CUTE
Wait- does the purple eye shadow possibly mean Virgil's turning more and more into a light side?? If so, does that mean he won't be Anxiety anymore?? DOES THAT MEAN WE'LL LOSE OUR DARK STRANGE SON?!        You know when you think of a theory and then you immediately regret it?
Okay but like: -✨THE ANIMATIC✨💖💕 -The heartfelt moments! -The lines that made us laugh -🏳️‍🌈👁👄👁s -NICO FLORESSSSSS -Freaking Thomas flirting with social anxiety  -The DYNAMIC of Virgil and Roman -A heartfelt, happy, hilarious video that made us come out with joy instead of worry and uncertainty compared to the last Sander Sides video. Not saying that I dislike the last video I ADORED it! And I adore this video too! I’m just happy for the change of pace. It’s just Character!Thomas has gone through a lot in the main series and idk...I just want him to win at Christmas and he did at this!
i want patton.
ahhhhh <3
This reminded me of when I asked out my best friend over quarentine... I had no idea if she was staight or lesbian of pan or bi or anything so I just impulsively asked it was WORTH IT.
Oh man if I only wasn't broke
I love this video this was amazing thank you thomas for such an amazing video also i love virgils new eyesshadow under his eyes❤❤❤
Nico and Thomas are what I didn’t know I needed in my life
Is no one going to talk about how when he tails Thomas to delete the tweet his eyeshadow went black then it went purple again.
i love this
i cried way too fucking hard..
Nico saying "you should have just said hi!" Has my whole heart
Vurgils purple eye makeup is bitterly one of the best things ever. I love it so much.
I LOVE THIIIIISSSSS
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOWWWWW😍😍😍
Ahhh the endingg!!! My heart I-
9:21  10:07  16:11  19:05  19:30  19:56  20:08  22:34
CUUUUTE
I’ve watched this like 6 times. The end makes me smile so much. Virgil just AAAAAAAAAH!
This is way to relatable. Just flip the genders and it’s be on a Friday night
This makes me appreciate being Aromantic. Because you never have to be a romantic disaster. However I relate to this on a friendship level.
NO bOdy  Gonna notice romans little huff when Thomas said “ Nothing but a brused ego “  That may have made Roman a little uncomfortable considering what happend last episode    Just a theory :>
This is one step closer to prinxiety being canon so 😔👌
The gay panic/freak out at the end is so funny!!
waoeeee virgil with his purple eyeshadow—
Love the purple shadow for Virgil. Also this episode was adorable
Anyone else expected Patton to burst out of those stall doors when Roman said he had to 'speak from the heart'
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Virgil was so excited!!! Is no one gonna talk about the purple eyeshadow acting as a blush for him!!? Ahhh!! My dark strange son!!!
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK THE PURPLE EYESHADOW ON VIRGIL?!?!
Wait vigils eyeshadow change omg is he changing from a negative side to a positive one?
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SPARKLE AND GLITTER IN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY ! VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SPARKLE AND GLITTER IN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY! VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SPARKLE AND GLITTER IN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY! PLS!! Can other people see this or is it just me??!?!!
so this is just another reason to ship princexity also are people going to make Thomas x Nico art now because I'd like to see that
Thomas Sanders is our gay, socially anxious Mr. Rogers.
There such good friends now I love it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!
Omg this was amazing!! 😂😂
THIS HAS BOYF RIENDS ENERGY
I need more gay stories 👆
THE PURPLE EYESHADOOOOOOOOOOW I JUST ZCXTAUANDIDMSOSM
I'm so happy I finally watched it! After a long day of me focused on school I got to watch it!!! I really loved it and that ending with them screaming with joy warmed my heart!!!!💛💛💛
I constantly struggle with wanting to ship Virgil and Roman and this episode kinda gives me hope that it might be okay to ship the sides. Tho tbh the reason I hesitate to even make the tiniest fan art is because I don't wanna contribute into upsetting Thomas since he's a real person. HHhhhhhhhhh!!  I have never experience wanting to ship a real person before or in this case ummm....Fictional characters that represent said person. It's cause it's hard not to ship em when they are all each such interesting characters.  I am honestly hoping Thomas did at least mention it was okay and it wasn't weirding him out.   Anyway, this video was lovely and Virgil's eye shadow......Bluuuush? Was adorable! We love ya Thomas<3
THIS FEELS REALLY GAY AND I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT
WHY AM I CRYING, WHY AM I CRYING AAAAAH
Been a hot second since I watched this show [By that I mean 7 months] And in not sure how to feel
Love Virgil's make-up
THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL TT_TT
Or "Two peices of the disaster gays personality who are also disaster gays try to help disaster gay #1 get a boyfriend"  Could be gayer
15:41 Will _what_ be the answer to all our problems?
Theory: Virgil represents both anxiety and excitement, when he is anxious, he has black eyeshadow. when he is excited, he has purple eyeshadow. Also, nervousness and excitement are opposites but still have similarities. Hopefully, you guys understand this theory. Edit: I just have to edit this, Thomas explained that the purple eyeshadow meant "butterflies in my stomach" kinda thing. So I might be VERY wrong on this one but in other countries,  that saying meant being nervous and stuff. Here in the Philippines, that meant excitement + love. (There is no English word for it but the Filipino word is 'kilig') So I think the eyeshadow meant love?? (prinxiety reee-) that's my theory for now, and I would like to think I'm so wrong and I'm just overthinking it.
This was cool
The ship are rigth all along
This was such a realistic portrayal of the kind of anxiety that I deal with sometimes, and it made my heart so achey and warm.
I can’t join patron 😭😭. I’m not 18+ so I would have to ask my parents and they would say no right away. 😭😭
I kinda thought this was the reveal of the orange side but never mind this is better 😁🍿🥤
Ok, something that I feel some people are getting hooked up on is the fact that Virgil said something about leaning on deceit and if that's fair to him and thinking he is referring to Janus. I think that thinking is wrong, I think Virgil was talking about how it wouldn't be fair to build a relationship with Nico based on deceit, not necessarily in referencing Janus. I could be wrong, but that is just my interpretation of that scene.
me at the start: *exited squealing*  me at the other start: *what the heck Roman&Virgil*  me at the end: *YASSSSSSSSS* me realises what that end bit caused.  me: *NO WAIT NO THEY'RE COMING* the Prinxeity shippers: *DID SOMEONE SAY SHIPPPP* *me cries in corner from sad Roceit heart*
*Thomas making a fictional character that falls in love with him to stray from the fact that he's lonely*
Need to which https://youtu.be/esK7yoJUX6Q
Roman: What the HELL was that? Thomas: I dunno don't look at me! Me: *contemplating breaking the fourth wall*
Oh my gosh I've missed Virgil!
Was it just me, or did we just see a whole prinxiety moment like more then once 👀
THIS IS SO ADORABLE OMG GWHAHWBHSKFKFKDLK1IWUSHZH 💜💜💜💜💜💜
The whole Virgil's eyeshadow changing color is just amazing. Omg I loved this Sanders Asides.
I’d love to see this in live action !
so when Virgil gets anxious he goes multi voice, yet when he big hap, he has purple bags. I love it
does roman have a crush on virgil or?
Anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow change?
I have a theory. Roman and Virgil have been hanging out together for quite a while, which has caused Virgil's antagonistic views of Janas to brush off onto Roman, which is why Roman is so upset with Thomas accepting Janas as a part of himself. They both fear Janas is turning Thomas more and more into a liar, which is why Roman and Virgil call Thomas out on every little white lie he's done.
"And that, kids, is how I met your father."
I forgot how deep these get and I started crying-
C h a c h a r e a l s m o o t h
'Nico Flores' sound like Filipino to me~~ P.s I almost freaking cried, this is soo ep freaking beautiful ♥️
Roman and remus both say "shut up emo" and I love it
Virgil so nice! And this is so cute!
I have like 5 things to say right now  1. Virgil's eyeshadow I was purple when he was excited and black when he wasn't 2. My birthday was the  8th so this is like a birthday gift for me (I'm 14 now) 3. This was AMAZING 4. Im sad because I'm broke and can't join your Patreon 5. This video made my day so much better even to it only 9am
When u said gay eyes I could immediately pinpoint the points in my life when I've had gay eyes
Bathroom scene made me cry T_T its depressingly relatable lol
This vid made me so happy I’d cried I love u Thomas
Catch me crying the club
Better title: Thomas gay panicking for 20 minutes while PRINXITY happens in the background lmao, AMAZING work thomas your doing great!!!!💜💜💜💜💜
My ship is sailing🤩
so i hear "gay ice" so i was so confused with virgil
This was a rollercoaster I was not ready for
uh oh...virgil is quite the...virgil
I mean, we already knew *Roman* was a himbo, but as it turns out, Virgil and Thomas are himbos too.
*Roman touches Virgil* me:I am fking dead *on the floor* My mom:Ur not
IF THIS WAS IRL THIS WOULD BE EVEN MORE ADORABLE AHHH
Gosh dANG IT THOMAS I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE ROMAN FLIRTING WITH VIRGIL  "FLIRTING WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY"
that was so cute oml ♡♡♡♡
THE SHIP THE SHIP THE SHIP
oH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS   tHIS IS SO AMAZING I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THE PURPLE EYESHADOW, AND THE DRAWINGS WERE SOOOO PERFECT
I kinda hope Nico is a real dude cause yes.
OMG  OMG OMG OMG OMG PRINXIETY?!
What I got from this  Character Thomas has a potential boyfriend  Prinxiety is canon  Virgil’s new eyeshadow
“We don’t know if he’s not gay”  “You have used that argument on me far too many times”
The flustered and happy giggles I just did you wouldn’t believe
Yayayayauayay
THE EYESHADOW I CANT
my  storyboarder brain was admiring this on top of the thought of a official Sanders sides animatic great  video all together
Stunning video!
OH MY GOD VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE
I thought you were like a little cute before I saw this and now I'm like Omg he's like a little potato
This makes me ship Prinxiety anymore... I love it.
*LIVE ACTION LIVE ACTION LIVE ACTION*
The romance between Roman and Virgil
For those who didn’t watch through the end there is a end credit goodie past the Patron announcement        Is Virgils eyeshadow purple? Or is that just the light. Like when he’s happy and it looks purple then switches back to raccoon when he’s stressed.
HELP! IT'S BACK! MY PRINXIETY OBSESSION! NOOOOOOO- okay but seriously I love this
Does anybody else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow at the end kept changing from purple to black                Just me?  Ok
Panic attack 📈📈📈📈📈
Is nobody going to notice that when Virgil said that Roman was making a mistake, his response was” add it to the list”
Roman: *is talking to Virgil) Virgil: *is blushing like a strawberry* Me: *screaming in Princixty*
I HAD A GOOFY SMILE ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALSO GAY PANICINING IS A MOOD
Not only is this lovely storytelling, in the singular and episodic senses, both, but you also give the Fander-matic community such a legit nod?!?!  We stander.
Is that a lego Disney castle in the background
And you’re going to tell me that Roman and Vergil aren’t in love? Lol. This was amazingly cute. Please stay safe Thomas.
Ah yes the stampede of Prinxiety shippers and the echoes of the sobs of broke students are strong here
Pls make this when its safe in real life and on your yt channel
This is so adorable and so funny I bet it was hilarious talking to yourself in the studio
*literally squeals* so prinxiety is confirmed
I had NO idea you were in your 30's dude! I still thought you were below 24! You are gorgeous, my dude!
As someone who also struggles with social anxiety, the arguments I have in my head when I'm thinking about this kind of situation (and others) is, you never will know the answer unless you ask, and it's better to regret doing something than regret not doing something.
Oh my god, why is this the most wholesome thing I've ever seen?
I'm nervous sweating just watching this but oml this is too cute
I didn't know Tom was gay. I dig it. 👍      I feel like I should have known.
I was getting anxious watching this. I absolutely love this video. You should more.
This gave me all the feels in all teary eyed and so magical I love watching these all the time 🤩😍❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍💗
Prinxiety shippers are gonna love this video  Edit: I wanna see the orange side soon! When is the next Sanders Side video?
Idk about you but i squealed at 19:33 hahaha.... Hahaha.... Nice video, cool art style, I love it!
virgin: you're making a mistake roman: if I am I'm adding it to the list *angst??!*  Edit: Virgil* but somehow the mistake was funny so I'm keeping it
I wonder what logic is doing during this, i imagine ripping his hair out
I wanna join the patreon but I’m too poor! 😭
Okay but the emotion in Thomas' voice is just so real. I can feel what he's feeling tbh . I also really loved this video. It's cute and well done. I laughed, I cried. Beautiful.
I missed you so much Thomas!!!!! SO HAPPY TO HAVE SANDERS SIDES BAAACK!!!!!
Virgil: That's a classic introverted method of talking about yourself without doing anything too extreme ...like talking  How do you write such quotable lines?
I love me a jacksepticeye reference
Poor bathroom dude though :((
I died at 19:28 to 20:03 ITS SO CUTE AND PRECIOUS, and i love the interection between Virgil and Roman
Little emo boi has happy eye shadow
Virgil x Roman shines through this episode so much! plus Thomas x Nico for the win!
I've been waiting for this for so long- HOW HAVE I MISSED THIS?!
“Well... Let's not waste this one.” MY HEART OH MY GOD
Love how vigils eye shadow changes from black to light blush purple when he’s happy 😊
Anyone else here who ships Prinxiety??
Was the Creep by Radiohead reference in 6:51 intentional or am I reading too much into it???? Cause if it was intentional, N I C E 👌👌
Roman :bravery  Roman :pats vigils shoulder* Virgilxroman fans:AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YES YES ITS HAPPENING 😆 Me:yes Thomas got a boyfriend or some what a  chance 😆😊👍
OH MY GOD THAT WAS SO CUTEEEEEEE
This animation was so freaking adorable  ❤❤❤
I wanted Roman to tell Virgil he is gay panic
Awww......very scary but awwww
I want to cry so much!!! I am writing a story myself and now I have an idea on how to explain one of the character's feelings and thoughts. Thank you so much!
this was one of my favorite sandersides episodes that you’ve uploaded, good job Thomas and team!! :)
THIS IS SO SWEET IM NOT CRYING YOU’RE CRYING
Can we just talk about the absolute POWER MOVE that Virgil did-!
I’m gonna need to know if this was based of a real life experience.
Could be gayer?
So is this the pitch for a Sanders Sides animated tv show? Because at this point, I think we should just call Cartoon Network and tell them we found their next show. This is fantastic. I would watch the heck out of this
I love the thing with the eyeshadow on virgil that was awesome
WHY ARE THESE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT DON’T HAPPEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS OLD, PANSEXUAL, BELGIAN GIRLS????!!!!
*"P I N T R O V E R T"*
I got so many Prinxity vibes from this- but yEs this is amazing
This is literally my freaking mind -_- Annnnd that's why when I get anxious or something, I say  "Virgil, shut up" people may or may not think I'm weird... There is this one girl at school with a Virgil backpack (Honestly this was surprising because I go to a christian school) though so she doesn't think I'm weird! :) or does she...
I'm getting the patreon you watch and see Mr. Thomas Sanders. GRRR BARK BARK BARKITY
No one:  Thomas: tOp oF tHe mOrnIn tO Ya
Hi, this is amazing and sweet and very cute and makes me extremely happy thank you hope you are well as well.
Princey and Virgil working together?!   (Dream come true)
Prinxiety just happened right before my eyes
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:6  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
GERARD GAY!! I’m screaming!!
Ahh Thomas I missed youuuu, and this is such a perfect note to come back on, I can’t explain how much joy this made me feel haha
Roman is taking the saying “If you can’t beat them, join them.” A little to far
"Love is a key ingredient to many things"   Me: Yeah pain-
That was adorable!!! Omg the ending had me 🥺🥺🥺 can I just say I love you you’re adorable and me and my friends are making our own scripted series Because of you!!!
Everyone is talking about the art, but what I wanna know is this: Can People see the sides? Just imagine them going out in public and, say Virgil, makes Thomas mad. If Thomas yells at him, would people be like "who is he yelling at..?" Or "Why is he yelling at that poor emo boy?"
EKKKK.   Our boys are back!!!
that is so fucking adorable
omg I cried..  that was an amazing episode! * lets not waste this one * I loved it!  I also loved that little detail that the color of Virgil's eyeshadow changes to purple when he gets excited! And that you got to work together with Alex! I love his stuff! As always, I'm looking forward to the next episode! Have fun making it!
This is so well animated and amusing love it 😍  Also I’d just hide the fact I was interested into anyone being as I’ve no clue what romance is but this was super sweet 💕  This is me just wanting to make friends but I always feel like I mess that up at times
Liars: •Janus  •Kei’s brother •Kokichi Ouma 😼 •Me about my sexuality
Omg i need to see this in live Action, That was the sweetest thing ever😍😍
I wish Patton was in this episode he’s my favorite 😿😿😿
y o u  a r e g a y
When Virgil happy, Virgil makeup purple. OH MY GOD. HELP.  (Also that video was ADORABLE ! I loved the animations, it was so well done and I'm really excited for the next videos !! Props to the whole team, you guys are incredible :D)
Virgil sitting on a surface that's not meant to be sat on cuz he's stressed <3
you can live like.... both parts opf me went zinger!
Forth time I’m watching this in 20 hours
GERARD GAY S E N T  M E
So after a lot of excitement watching this I noticed that Virgils eyeshadow changes colors near the end like first it’s purple then it’s back to his regular black then purple again and I was like •-• wow
*cries in broke*
Universe: So, now that you’ve been committed to skipping a callback that could have been the answer to your wildest dreams, thrown Remus at you and put you and half the Sides through the angsty emotional mess that was the last episode, can you guess what’s next?  Character Thomas, fearing the worst: Uh.......what?  Universe: One cute guy and a heaping pile of romance comin up
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Okay after this 'Sander Asides' episode I now have a head-canon that after the latest 'Sander Sides' episode Virgil and Roman became closer to one another, or just became bros   Also, this episode has fulled my Prinxiety heart
I don't know why but Thomas looks like a teenage Timmy Turnner without the hat.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
A trash bin 💅
19:56 oh the Prinxiety shippers are going to have a fucking field day with this
O m l I’m to exited about this
oh boy i swear i got so hyped up towards the end i was crying, freaking out, and my hands were jittery but in a good way-
Nice Radiohead reference also . . . as a (also single) fander that's older than you, Thomas . . . *OUCH!!*
Anxiety being positive Getting anxiety because, you might not see the guy again
22:54 Happy Virgil: specks of purple eyeshadow Upset/anxious Virgil: *Amy Winehouse starts playing* Back to Black  Details... ❤️
(24:04) Virgil: *spacing out* Dog: *BARKBARKBARK* Virgil: AhHhH dEmOn
WHAT WAS THAT LOOK AT ROMAN AT THE END VIRGIL???? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT??????????
I SMELL PRIXIADY
The ending makes me *SCREAMMMM*
When Virgil and Roman are blushing at each other and you ship it: SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Virgil: *sees roman sad* Roman: *sad* Virgil: *panic attack & pushes thomas* Me: *GaSp* SHIP-  ALSO DOES VIRGIL HAVE PURPLE EYESHADOW NOW BDHDHHZHDGDHD ITS BEAUTIFULLLL
prinxiety shippers are THRIVING rn
I think we need to start count Deceit and Remus into openings. They are also Thomas' sides after all.
Aaaaaaaaaaa! My poor bi heart!
"You can live like Jack & Sally if you want."  *I miss you by Blink-182 starts playing*
i have a feeling the prinxiety shippers are gonna like this one
Gorgeous story but getting like seven mid-roll ads did interrupt the flow :(
I'm a simple person; I see a Sander sides video... I click  Also I saw social anxiety & for a minute thought "Oh, social introversion... Me."  Then I realized it was Social anxiety... & It's a video that is calling me out
I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS IN MY NOTIFICATIONS THAT I SPENT SO LONG PREPARING FOR THIS.
This is the tv series I’ve always wanted. ❤️
Roman: "We don't know if he's not gay." Thomas: "You have used that argument on me far too many times."  Absolutely hilarious.
I ABSOLUTELY LOV ABDILLUSTRATES!!!!! THEY ARE AWESOME!!!! I AM LITERALLY SCREAMING!!!!
did this happen in real life???
I’ve been waiting for a new video and I’m so glad it’s out 😊
I can relate to this by an emotional level. OmO
Ok,Frist of all. ThomNiko ship? Is Niko real? Second. Why is Janus still been treated like a bad guy?  Third. Where Patton and Logan and Janis?  Fourth.The bathroom guy desevers better. My guy was so nice to Thomas and he didn’t even thank him. (Who am I kidding,I still love you Thomas but plaese make it up to bathroom guy and learn his name)
i feel like i watched a mini movie  but i had a dream thomas made this and me commenting on it.. why is my dreams coming true?
Loved the art and the episode! Would love to see a live action when all this is over!! <3
This is the cutest episode yet
Happy Virgil: Purple eyeshadow  Panicked Virgil: Black eyeshadow
I see Virgil's under eye change when he's happy and to normal. Omygosh it's pretty and cute I LOVE IT!
Thomas reallly looked at his own personality and said 'could be gayer'
“QUICK! HIDE SO HE DOESNT SEE YOUR SHAME!” *jumps in trash can*
soo...stalking? OH YOURE RIGHT!
That story was so cute
All three of them screaming at the end was such a mood. I wanted to do that multiple times throughout this video 😂
DID ANY OF YOU REALISE VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW AT THE END ,from its light purple glimmering serenity it slowly faded into its coal coloured self as he grew more anxious...  i wonder if it turned that shimmering purple during his act of bravery
CAN WE GET MORE ANIMATICS PLEASE. Holy crap!!
Did you guys notice when virgil is happy or excited he has purple eye shadow but when he feels anxious, it goes back to black. Nice touch Thomas!
16:00 don't mind me just marking my favorite bit
It is wierd that Thomas and Roman did not notice Virgil's eyeshadow change
Best birthday gift everrr
I’m happy you will still do the normal content for people that don’t have money for patreon.
The changing of Virgil's eyeshadow aligning with his feelings 😍😍
ROMAN X VIRGIL FOR LIFE
Thumbs up if you have social anxiety and this perfectly represents what happens when one of us is brave enough to approach your crush, especially when god is not on your side.. :)
“It’s ok it’s ok! Except that it’s not, I’m fReAKiNg oUt!!”
No offense, but I felt like I was watching a fan animatic. :/
I didn't know that stickers could be used this way..      *Interesting*
Omg this episode is gonna make shippers loose their minds-
OMG. I'm feeling so many things! This was beautiful.
ITS HAPPENING OMG YES!!!!!!!!!! makes me wonder when they'll go full animation..
I can't believe this is a real episode- I love it so much
The blushing, the hearts, the shoulder touches, oh yes, it's all adding up
I'm not crying you are.
My notifications notified me of this 19 Hours Late I’ve already watched it but my notifications still notified me 19 hours late Also I love this video
Line repeat: 30 times a day 1st: 2:36 2nd 3:27 3rd 24:10 I can see why Virgil said don’t tell me to relax
This whole video is just Virge and Princey bullying Thomas and calling him a liar well making him try to flirt with a random guy
I got so fricking happy, I legit cried!!!
OKAY BUT MY THEORY FOR VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW THO-  i think whenever he gets overly excited??? we've all been there. the excitement to the point we feel our heart racing, stomach churning but still so happy??? THATS when his eyeshadow starts to glow and turn into this pretty purple and glittery shade!! but when he's back to his own reality again, it turns to his normal black. THE DETAILS.
OMG I VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW CHANGED FROM PURPLE TO BLACK MID SCENE!!! It was purple when he walked in and was all excited, so at first I thought it was just a change of character design, but then, after Thomas asked “are we ready for this?” It went back to black! Does that mean that when Thomas feels “good” anxiety (excitement, butterflies) Virgil’s eyeshadow is purple and when it’s regular anxiety it’s black?
I just noticed that Virgil's eye makeup changes to purple when he's happy, or optimistic. Oh wow.   I also noticed the missing character slot in the last Sanders Sides...waiting on the reveal of the next side
Can everybody please take a momet to admire an ecited Virgil? The sparkle purple eyeshadow dude.... u shine.... "bright like a diamond" (cit. Patton <3 )  P.S. The cutest trio ever!!!!!!!! LOVE U ALL
YES THIS IS AMAZING (btw do you think the sides will ever meet sleep?)
Thomas:*does anything*  Roman and Virgil:LIAR!!!!!
hjhjhjdhjkh the second hand embarrassment was killing me the entire time but it was worth it. that was so cute :)
"I hate to rain on your black parade  Gerard Gay!" Oooooohhhhhhh iiiiiiiiiiii-oooooooooooohhhhhh🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
Omg love this so much, can't wait to see if it turns into a live action. this would be a great live action
D-did..       *did the creator of a character just confirm a ship because if so imposter break into my room and call me sus because I am going TO KILL MY ROOM OF PRINCIETY MERCH AND BURN IT IN A CERAMONY OF THE HOLY EMO.*
There's so much salt in the way they say "Liar" 💀👀
this hit the feels, so wholesome ToT heart warming ❤️
Thomas:*pets dog*  Roman:*points at thomas* LIAR!!!  Virgil:*gives Thomas a disappointed face*  Thomas' pov:(what did I do? How am I a liar? El princede es el stupido...)  4:12
This will probably get lost in the sea of comments, but I want to say thank you so much for everything you do, Thomas.💜
Wait, did Roman just say after Virgil said "ur making a mistake" he'll "add it to the list" ... Roman are you ok? Do you need a hug and so Ice cream? Bcz we can do that!
wait this is recent
THE ART: AMAZING . THE STORY : AMAZING . THOMAS & NICO : AMAZING . ROMAN & VIRLGIL: GREAT BUT HORRIBLE WINGMEN
AWW! VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HE'S ANXIOUSLY FLUSTERED!! (the Roman goes and spoils it...BUT IT COMES BACK!) IT'S SO CUUUUTE
HE IS PERFECT
*Screams* Oh my god oh my god Virgil let Thomas talk to a cute boy!!!!
I just love how much hard work and love goes into these videos
Gah! My head has now gone into theory World Thomas! I'm so happy I needed this and know I have something to smile about. Also the patron has a great name I mean like 👏👏👏👏 props to you and the team! Stay safe you adorable bean!
„You have to shake your hands, they’re just hanging there“ yeah I feel that
Wow Roman was not kidding on that guy hehe 🌈🌈
THEEEE SHIPPPPPPPP OMGGGGG!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY
I have never related to something so much
The Answer: You Don't
virgil and roman bully thomas: the movie
why do I feel like  roman and Virgil bonded over hating januS
Aaahhh a new oneee
why this is like looking into a mirror? this happen to me all the time! my backpack is full of pride pin and pin in general for this reason. i love this episode with all my (anxious)  heart
The moment between them was so freaking cute 🥺
Stimming Virgil with the purple eyeshadow 😊💕💕💕💕💕
LEGIT IN TEARS OH MY GOD AHHHH
I never wished I had money more than now😂
random dog: *BARK*
Me and Thomas during this video: *happy stimming INTENSIFIES*
Youtube is getting too comfortable with these dubble nonskippable adds 6 timers per vid (love supporting through watching adds but hhh youtube is pushing it)
Anxiety eye shadow changed 🧐
omg the eye shadow tho idk if i like the black or purple omg did remus do his eyeshadow he has purple eyeshadow does that mean???? that is so cute and the fact there getting along so much better is adorable i love the vidoe so much
That was BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭😭
more of this and only this from now on please and thank you
I can't join
2:20
Anyone noticed how Virgil's glittery purple eyeshadow turns black when he's super duper anxious?
I saw that Yu-Gi-Oh reference- This love story was so adorable though
OH 👏 MY 👏 GOD 👏 THIS WAS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN DUIEHDIWOE OMG OMG EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO DIE FROM THE CUTENESS OVERLOAD HOLY HECK SJSIWOEND
This gave me heather vibes😭❤️💔
(Episode summary) *They:* liar  *Me:* deciet  *They:* yes and gay
Omg i love this
Thomas and the sides having the same hair shape but different bangs is my favorite part (detail wise...I mean XD)
“HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY” 🤣 OH MY GOD-
3 AM BRAIN TALKING I HAVE A THEORY!  Virgil wasn't always anxiety. I mean we kinda knew that but I think I figured out who Virgil was: EXCITEMENT. That's why Patton is always defending him, because joy and excitement go hand in hand. If you notice Virgil's room, its still things Thomas ENJOYS. Being scared and being excited in a young child are typically a similar emotion until the age of 4 or 5, and as we saw with Roman and Remus, Thomas has developed several sides over the course of his life. What's to stop a side from doing the same? The purple eye shadow is the key. That's old excitement coming out. And I'll be, excited (get it) if this is the big reveal later. Love your work Thomas, Joan, and the rest of these wonderful artists. Peace out!
19:12 "Are you okay?" "Oh? Yeah, nothing but a bruised ego" *Cuts to Roman*
Virgil and roman is the best ship in the world even tho they ain't real also if that dude is real I allow it 😉  also I love the purple eyeshadow
we want more
x dhb hkJSKJNXEAKSN ACKDANwa  The Prinxiety HAD to be intentional, right? Right? I'm not crazy, you're crazy- But seriously, I got lots of Prinxiety vibes. If they didn't do it on purpose, that's fine, I'm a multi-shipper I can survivr.
Bravery!! The opposite of anxiety!!! That's why Virgil's eyeshadow was purple when he was excited and he felt anxious it went back to his original black eyeshadow!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaand back to shipping prinxiety I go-
This video is basically "gay panic the movie"
2:10 - Roman 2:16 - patton 2:18 - patton and roman?
Man it’d sure be nice to have a Roman so I don’t just see things and have anxiety say “don’t do it” and me respond “haha yeah you right that’d be a disaster” and then never doing anything ever.
I REALLY HOPE THIS BECOMES A SHOW I-
This gave me SO MANY FEELINGS
I didn't even realize this came out on my birthday! Awesome birthday present!
The gay panic is real. I wish my local mall wasnt torn down years ago. Probably been over a decade tbh
this leggit one of my favorite eps for far wow
*sees the patreon*   *cries in broke student*
"yea im just overthinking things" "YEA join me, not thinking :D" Oh Roman😂
THAT WAS SO ROMANTIC-
Roman: One more chance at happiness, squandered.. **sighs disappointingly** it's probably for the best...  Virgil: **Looks at Roman with sympathy/worry**  Me while *screeching* like the fan-person I am: I sense some love happening!!
The amount of prinxiety this episode... It's too much
I swear to god hes giving us prinxiety moments on purpose now
FINALLYYYYYY YEEEESSS
prinxiety confirmed.
i swear to god... who the HELL would dislike this series  i swear people doesn’t have taste 😚✌️
Darn I bet another of people are now shipping prinxety now............I like analogic tho ;-;
whelp tried to become a patreon member and it said I couldn't "Oh no! It looks like you don't have permission to pledge to Thomas Sanders. The most common reasons for this are due to previous payment declines or suspicious activity. If you feel this block was in error, we suggest reaching out to Thomas Sanders on another platform." Thomas help!!! Sucks really wanted a chance at the tee.
my heart. this is SO SWEET IM DYING. MY HEART CANT HANDLE THIS🖐🏽💕
THE BLINK-182 REFERENCE  THE  B L I N K - 1 8 2  R E F E R E N C E
Every upload is such a banger i am literally the physical embodiment of :3 rn
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING A VIDEO!
CUTEEEE
I can't tell how much I love this
At 19:35 is when the Prinxety shippers start squealing and squabbling, just for a heads up.
Omggggg this was so good. Whaaaattttt
THAT WASN'T GOOD FOR MY HEART 😭 this was so amazing!! You and everyone who helped are so cool!
AAAAAAAAAAA THIS WAS SO CUTE THANK YOU
Okay but why- WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL’S HAPPY PURPLE EYESHADOW I-   BOIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I need a part 2 of this
are we just gonna ignore the fact that he talks to himself in public...in front of people
“Idk plant” same
"yeah I gotta stop move strangers in bathrooms" pfrrr 😂
Prinxietyyyyyyy 👏👏👏
Can someone tell me if Virgil know Deceit's name?  Also i love Virgil's purple eyeshadow
Does Virgil’s eyeshadow turn purple when he’s happy?? That’s so cuuuute!
The fact that it's animated allows more possibilities and creativity, giving this style of video some potential.
Oh beautest bard in the court of food His eyes so calm and he my heart understood His voice draw me closer from under the hood Oh! How can a guy be so good? Oh I fell for that dude!  Well that was fun
These two remind me of carlos and cecil from wtnv
Love it. This made me think, I'm kinda in a similar position, but I already got to know them. The thing is, I'm not sure if get the signals right .    I need help  Update: I met up with them yesterday and talked about us. We both got some clarity, but are both on a difficult path at the moment. We like eachother, but don't know how exactly (but it's definitely more than just friendship) but it's chill. We said let's keep it going like before and see where it leads. So yeah, thank you Thomas for giving me the strength with this video. I o u one
Is it dramatic if I said I lowkey cried-  Fav moments: - Virgil getting the courage to push Thomas to talk to Niko or Nico- HowEverYouWannaSpellIt - VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW - Virgil and Roman at the end alskdhj - Seeing Virgil again  - And Virgil sitting on the sink in the bathroom bc uh.. Yeah..
10:34  Virgil: You’re making a mistake! Roman: If I am, then I’ll add it to the LIST!  Why did that break my heart so much 😭 Someone please help the ego’s ego
Nico: "Are you okay?" Thomas: "Nothing but a bruised ego." Roman: 👁👄👁
Wait when Virgil is happy he has purple eyeshadow?    That is the coolest thing ever-
I heard if you say a Youtubers name 3 times you get pinned    Thomas Sanders  Thomas Sanders  Thomas Sanders
When you're at a mall and you can't find a store but you have social anxiety: Let me just aimlessly walk around in the hope of finding that store so I don't have to talk to people.
Holy COw- This episode was a hit, dude! I also made a theory about Virgil's face at the near by end of the episode before he screamed demon. It's possible he might have thought about the Moving On episode part 1 and 2, so he started to become worried but he was then distracted by the dog.
ALEX IS PART OF THIS OH MY GOD
U have no idea how happy this video has made me
OH MY HADES I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!
this hurt my heart 😂 i wish i could find my love 😂 but my anxiety doesn’t even let me talk to anyone
the gay panic was REAL in this and I felt it in my SOUL
😍😍😍😍😍😍
omg thank you so much for posting. you made my day <3<3<3  btw what's up with Virgils eyeshadows
AHHHHH A NEW VIDEO
MY FANGIRL SCREAMS WONT HELPPPPPP
Wait... 7:32 is that.... ETHAN?!
When do I get to buy a “pintrovert” button-
When Virgil is all exited and happy he has the purple eyeshadow when he is his anxious he has normal eyeshadow he’s being very active and we have no idea how much turmoil Roman and Virgil are in because of Deceit. May I say the shippers are practically screaming now tho! Thanks for this Thomas and see ya next time it was a wonderful video!
Dear All the Artists ,you did all amazing job
Aww my baby boy Virgil ❤️🥺
i haven't been able to stop thinking about the yu-gi-oh pin and then my brain decided Virgil sounded like Kaiba at 12:36?? help
So, uh... Did you add a psychic to your team cuz this is my exact situation...
Did anyone else love the eyeshadow change virgil had when he Got happy and excited!? I cried because he was so genuinly happy!!!💜💜💜
AAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS AMAZING! The similar thing happens to me every single time I’m out in public! Seeing clashing emotions personified so accurately and the everyday stress of approaching people with LGBT curiosity is very beautiful!!! Oh my gosh you guys are doing amazing work!! And I’m so glad to see this in animatic format. Dealing with anxiety and stuff is so difficult but these videos really help me figure out how to cope. Thank you so much! Love you guys!
FINALLLYYYY
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ahem. Right. So, the reasons for this: This video screams Prinxiety and I love it. (I don't even ship Prinxiety on its own that much, I ship all of them together, headcanon being that once two sides accept each other as valuable parts of Thomas they fall in love with one another) Then, the purple eyeshadow, need I say more? Then, the *very* **very** relatable feeling of walking in circles and shaking your hands when feeling excited, just... accurate. And, of course, THe BLoody AmAzInG ART!!!!
Yup I felt this 💜💜 (loved the detail of Virgil’s eye shadow!)
What in the fresh diggity darn heck is up with Virgils eyeshadow, does that only happen when he’s excited
"This Video is essential viewing for the overall storyline"  I'm not sure if that's exciting or scary-
Gaaahhhhh! That was so cute! I loved it!
*Mean while in the mind palace* Patton: I’m so proud ;3
Alternative title: prinxiety gay panicking at the mall for 20 minutes
😍❤️❤️ I love Love ❤️
Dude... The awkwardness. I can relate.
😍😍😍
I wasn't expecting an animatic but this is BEAUTIFUL (BTW I love Virgil's new purple eye shadow)
"I dont know plant.."
Thomas Sanders, the real life version of Bo Burnham's left brain right brain
Roman touching vigils shoulder with the eye contact at the end of the animated scene so cute
Okay, but Virgil having purple eye bags when he's happy brings me so much joy. That excited anxiety, and character growth!! We love that for him!
....since when did roman and virgal team up?
Wait did this actually happen? Did Thomas actually start talking to someone again? fjksnchco THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL AHAH
I feel like there is a bit of flirting between Virge and Roman. And I absolutely love this 🏳‍🌈
That was so cute. I can't wait for it to become a show
Bro that whole thing was so cute, I love that virgil and Roman are actually getting along and I was hoping that roman would hug virgil but I guess they still have a long way to go before that happens
11:02 Oh my god He turned into JackSepticEye
Seeing Virgil legitimately happy there for a moment almost makes up for not seeing my boy Patton in this episode.  I'm so excited to see where this story is going. It seems like Janus and Virgil will be heavily featured so that'll be fun.
My favorite parts of this episode? Well yes.   I loved it all. The new format looks amazing. Prinxiety is back and I love it. Virgil has purple eyeshadow now too. The romance in this was absolutely adorable. The hints of Prinxiety at the ending animatic part made my heart go boom. The socially awkward people scenarios were funny as heck and I felt that. The gay panic at the end was just- yes. And the fact that there's a new patreon is great!! Amazing job to you Thomas and every person who worked on this with you. This is amazing!!
i stg when he said his name was 'nico' i screeched !!! they're both literally *SOLANGELO*
aww Virgil's eyeshadow is purple when he's ecstatic
Hey, yeah this is awesome
My three braincells at any given moment 😂  I friking love you sm Thomas, I can't-
idk if anyone has noticed this yet, but the plot for this episode is almost similar to 'in a heartbeat'. its almost like an extended version of it.
First episode I've watched
Roman: maybe "shut up emo" will be our always
I’ve watched this ten times already and words cannot describe how much I love this.
THE ENDING- MY PRINXIETY HEART IS CRYING YESSS
I was happy stimming so much during this video you have no idea!!!!! The humor was so perfect and stupid and maybe it's just 2am but it was so funny to me. And also... Virgil and Roman BONDING and INSPIRING EACH OTHER (and very obviously having crushes on the other)!   okay but for real, you can't tell me that Virgil and Roman don't like each other. The shoulder touch, the banter, the nicknames, the sideways glances when Thomas isn't looking, in Roman had little hearts around him at the end ffs!  Also VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN HE'S HAPPY I'M LITERALLY ABOUT TO CRY IT'S SO CUTE AND SO ADORABLE AND WHOLESOME
That whole animation was so real and accurate it physically hurt because his voice acting is honestly SO good
Omg I actually love this so much 😂😁❤️
I love the changing of Virgil's eyeshadow colour
oh no, i havent even watched the video yet but these comments are making me think im gonna sink back into my sides shipping phase dear gods save me  Update: its too late my friends, i have fallen down the rabbit hole
Thomas made me smile 30 times in this video. I gotta relax.
It's been a while since I watched you're video's!!        I missed watching Some!
AAAAAA THIS IS SO CUTE AJSKNSJF
roman: *touches virgil’s shoulder*  prinxiety shippers: *heavy breathing*
Im sure people have already noticed this but the end clip shows Virgil's eye bags being a bright purple at the start, when he's excited. And getting darker again after telling Thomas to delete the tweet- Such a lovely detail! But makes me worried to see it all dark at the end there, buddy-
Happy excited Virgil has purple eye makeup!! I love that!
Finally!!!!!
23:17 virgil care to explain why your eyeshadow changed back to black only there?
PRINXIETY CANON?  XD
I SEE PRINXIETY
I LOOV THISSS
OMG cuteee
ROMAN’S HEARTS ROMAN’S HEARTS ROMAN’S HEARTS HE HAD LIL HEARTS OMGOMGOMG
I’ve been waiting for this it’s finally here thank you Thomas
The only problem about this episode is that Thomas and the sides guessed the dudes pronouns/gender but other than that... I LOVE IT!!!!😍❤️❤️❤️
20:10   missed ya real life roman
This is very good. Love the story and I love to see you again. I don't think you need to redo that in live. It reminded me of Jaiden Animation or The Odd Ones Out, but in your own style.   If you are set to have a "final" version, the coolest way to do it would be to fully animate it in this style.
I love that Virgil’s undereye makeup was sparkly purple bc he was excited!!!!
8:33 Romans face tho xD
I like to think that when Thomas goes outside hes only allowed 2 sides to go with him lol
I saw you...........across the foodcourt......
I just noticed that when Virgil is all into the lovey dovey cute stuff his eye shadow turns purple I- wtf it's so cute I love it holly carpppppppp.
Love the video, can't wait to see it in live action.
Thomas is KILLING me and my fellow prinxiety shippers
I noticed how Virgil's eyeshadow changed with the fluctuation of his mood/happiness/excitement.  When he got stressed/upset (or maybe the fear/anxiety was starting to peak again) his eyeshadow was black and was bigger.  When he was excited/happy (perhaps when the anxiety eased or lessened momentarily) his eyeshadow was more colorful, more purple, and was much smaller.
Wait Virgil and Roman at the end where totally hearting each other
How can Roman and Virgil be both the best and the worst wingmen at the same time? 😂😂
11:19 took me a second but, JOAN
This video really do be calling out all the pins on my backpack and stickers on my computer- i feel a lil attacked-
THIS WAS SO CUTE OMG OMG OMG
Also the changes to Virge's eye shadow to indicate his happiness and excitement just!!! 💚💚💚
A nice detail I noticed- Throughout the video Roman and Virgil are constantly hovering over Thomas, scolding him and making him second guess everything to the point of pushing and pulling him when he’s trying to get the courage to talk to Nico, but after that final push from Virgil they actually step back, going as far as into the background and you can see them watching a bit away from them and let Thomas take over to just talk and get to know Nico Just something I wanted to share, the hard work that went into this is mind blowing and this video is amazing!!
THOMAS. ARE WE READY FOR THIS??? ARE WE READY FOR THIS????? EXCUSE ME???? YOU'RE LEAVING THIS OFF LIKE THIS????????
🤩😍 When Virgil's happy his eye shadow turns purple! Oh I love it! Happy eyeshadow! 💜
23:17 virgils eyeshadow changes XD
... I cried at the part where Roman said "bravery".... REEEEEEEE
Okay but Virgil, Roman and Thomas are like those girls who just all get excited when something good happens to one of them. Gay hype squad right here.
It broke me when Anxiety was the one who finally pushed him aaaaaaaa 😭 Anxious about having regrets again. Anxious about having another missed opportunity.  T'is beautiful
These artist where able to draw a TWENTY FOUR MINUTE ANIMATIC now THIS is dedication
IM SOBBING THIS IS SO ADORABLE 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
Why did the scene where they finally start talking to each other make me cry just a little bbshshshahaha
Roman and Virgil have officially shown affection towards each other         Now we can see the ship is sailing  (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
This made my gay self so happy
God I relate to this too hard it hurts whyyou gotta call me out like this. Thus ATTACK IMMA CRY
the enthusiasm at the end is so cute and contagious :,) i'm smiling so much
now ya see, i solve this issue by not focusing on anybody, ever can't embarrass yourself by flirting or trying to look for a cute human if you dont try to begin with!
This is very cute. I love it.
The moment when the 'I love you' moment- happened to you. That day.   I cry my ducking eyes out.  Also. Roman's disapproving "hm".
THE DUDE IN THE TOILET KILLED ME, I WANNA HUG HIM AFTER HE FLUSHES AND WASHES HIS HANDS-
Prinxiaty shippers are screaming
Awww I loved this one!!!
next time we get a sanders side or sanders asides is probaly in ten years when corona is gone
16:23 kinda sounds like "You mind kinda tellin me about them?" And WHST?? BRO NICO DO YOU KNOW??? NICO???
Roman: Shut up, emo..  I literally cried Y-Y Tears of joy ofc
I love this entire thing! I'm such a huge fan of animatics!   But also......VIRGIL WITH THE BRIGHT PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!
24:04 omg I relate so much😂
Oh my goodness!!! That was so stinking cute!!!!!
Yessss!!
Everyone: It's okay, we don't need to ship the sides anymore, it's not a big deal  This video:  Us:... So, how's the prinxiety obsession from three years ago coming along   I loved this so much, especially the little happy stims, it made me just so... happy <3
Yeeeaaaah our favorite snek has got a patreon
his he actually gay
i screamed
Can I just say  I hecking L O V E Virgil’s new look
Yes
I’m so excited this was so good!!
i just notice virgil change their make up due to how's he's feeling
I LOVE THIS! THE ARTISTS ARE AMAZING, OMGGG
MY GAY 💜
This was so cool and cute😆😊
Sorry to rain on your black parade 🕺
*that's gay*
22:35 me throughout the duration of this episode
This made me so happy
Um...Is anyone going to comment on when Virgil get's excited, his eyeshadow is a shimmery purple? Anyone? Okay, just me...
Did Virgil just scream!?
I'm getting hints of prinxiety in this does anyone else.see.that omg is this gonna be cannon?????
Are we not gonna talk abt all the ADORABLE squealing at the end? Especially the ever-brooding Virgil??
Does anyone else want to see this all as an anime series. Like an Ouran high school host club type anime. No... just me?
16:07 the definition of "gay panic"
Did anyone else notice the eyeshadow changes
So adorably awesome! 😭
Virgil: You are making a mistake! Roman: If I am, I'll add it to the list!  THAT LINE SHOCKED ME, ROMAN ADMITS HE'S DONE MISTAKES AND BY THE LAST EPISODE HE SURE DOES REGRET A LOT OF HIS CHOICES AND WHO DOES HE TRUST...
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW AT YHE END OF THE VIDEO VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW KEEPS CHANGING FROM PURPLE TO BACK TO HIS NORMAL BLACK!?!? Am I the only one who pays attention?
This may be weird but Thomas here highkey reminded me of Jeremy Heere-
* *Prinxiety shipper has entered the chat* *
I'm new here and honestly excited to watch this entire thing.
I may or may not be so touched and about to cry because it was so beautiful
The prinxiety shippers are gonna have a good time with this one
Maybe Virgil’s eyeshadow change to purple when he’s good panicking
This was the cutest episode I've ever seeeeeennnnn

Congratulations on writing a script so accurate it was physically painful to sit though. Secondhand embarrassment 100
Damn it Virgil! We👏get👏it.👏You're 👏adorable.👏.
Virgil's undereye makeup switching between sparkly purple for happy excited butterflies in the stomach sort of anxiety to the classic black for the worry and low simmer panic anxiety
Anyone else notice how shimmery Virgils makeup is at the end
Ok I died, the drawings a freakin ADORABLE!!!!!!
Thomas : Patron Me : *cries in broke*
This one hit really close to home for me. I see girls almost every day who I really would love to talk to and who have CLEAR signs of being in LGBT, for example, a pride belt, a badge, or a sticker, something like that but I'll always be too shy to ask. After this though, I think, next time I see someone with a clear LGBT sign who I think is really cute. I'm gonna ask about it and hope to start a conversation. :) Also I was literally sobbing at the end of this bc I can relate so much XD
CAN WE TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S MAKEUP WHEN HE'S HAPPY?!?!
I love how they made Vergil’s eye shadow sparkly at the end! 😊 Shows how even he can be excited too!💜
Does this mean we get another Patton and Logan episode next? Please!!!
Why was Vergil's eye shadow changing from purple to black and back at the end?
Me watching this: ITS HAPPENING HAHAHA ITS GOING THE RIGHT WAY
Omg am I the only one who saw that virgils Make-up changed when he got exited??? :00
*GAY SCREAMING*
Even thought this isnt a proper episode, I'm counting it as one and it's now my favourite.
THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE OF MINE OH MY GOD. thank u for this, I really needed to hear it. Anxiety stops me from taking so many chances and I don't want it to control my life like that (especially when I see a cute person from across the food court)
OMG I LOVE IT!! EEEEEEE
So nobody is going to mention the little heart by Roman's head when roman and virgil look away from each other, did no one see that it is it just me.... anyways this is so flipping cute!
VIRGIL EXCITED PURPLE EYE MAKEUP!!!
Did someone notice virgil's eye shadow changing from black and purple in the end just before the endcard.
yknow what i LOVE about this? the fact that it’s an animatic. because the way that i am is i love voice acting and audio and for things like this audio is 𝒂𝒄𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅 by the art.  im obsessed with audio and if i think about it enough i’m pretty sure it’s a coping mechanism linked with 𝓶𝔂 𝓬𝓱𝓲𝓵𝓭𝓱𝓸𝓸𝓭.  i could probably write a very long comment just talking about voice acting and probably most likely will sometime in the future edit* grammer
I love it here
me: I SAW BLUSH ON VIRGIL'S AND ROMAN'S FACE
Honestly, this is how I feel dailey, and when it came to the crush.... It makes me remember a girl I had known... Also did I notice a new type of eyeshadow on Virgil? It seemed a bit more glossy and purple.
PRINCXIETY
The eyeshadow Virgil had when he was super happy was beautiful!! I hope we see more of it and happy Virgil
The way Virgil’s eye shadow changed depending if he felt positive or negatively. Also was really hard not to scream from joy this was literally so cute.
At the end!!! Virgil's eyeshadow alternates bettwen bright purple and black!!
WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY THE EYESHADOWS TURN INTO SPARKLY PURPLE
Roman has big Himbo Energy. exhibit A: "no, man!" "It's ROman. With an R? You're rally struggling today"
*New video*  My friends: Relax    Me: DONT TELL ME TO RELAX!
If I was the dude he came up to I would have SOOOOO played along
Oh this is adorable! I've never seen or heard of this before. It's so cute! So are those other guys in the different colors the main characters consciousness or something? If this is part of a series I guess I should start at the beginning lol. Although it looks great in animation!
19:30 *happy flappy arms activated*
The story is so beautiful, and is actually kinda funny in the fact of it being how I asked out my girlfriend at school and was almost exact to what happened
Please make them all animated my GOD was this good
Thomas: **is in his thirties** Me who adopted him and all the sides: *MY BABIES ARE HAPPY*
no one:  Virgil: that's cyberstalking in real life-  Roman: you mean stalking?..  Virgil: OH YOUR RIGHT-  🤣🤣🤣
Bro let's just take a moment to appreciate this beutiful art it's what I like to call a master peace hehehe  HEART WITH AN AROW IN IT
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT VIRGIL SAW ROMAN UPSET SO HE PUSHED THOMAS FORWARD- CFHBVVJGVNJERK3DFRVGBHYUT65R4FVGB NHJMKUJYUY4TRETF
VIRGILLLLL!!!!!!! I missed you so much!!!!😄  And Virgil and Roman's dynamic is literally what happens in my head everyday of my life with everything!
I cannot find the words to explain how fRICKING AMAZING THIS EPISODE IS HOLY SH!T
I hate being brokeeeeeeee
*They were just chillin in the bathroom*
This is amazing, I love it, but a live action would awesome
17:11 I got so friken happy when Virgil pushed him
it wont let me join the , corridor of stored reward , :(   :(   :(
Who else anyone noticed that Virgil's eye makeup got all purple and sparkly when he was excited, but then back to black when he was anxious again?
Roman: just speak from the heart Me: remembers that one episode when Roman told Thomas that his heart what calling for him, and Patton just makes this weird noise. Also me: dies from my laughing so hard that that memory that I fell out of my chair 😂😂😂  I love his video so much!!!!!! They make my days! The end was really awesome!
My anxiety would be to much for me to talk to ANYONE so i would just stay in the chair and start crying because my I guess my deceit would just spread lies in my ears say I don't deserve them
it has been waaayyyy too long i love this so much
Virgils happy anxiety : Purple undereyes  Virgils doubtful anxiety : dark undereyes  Love the little details! Well done Thomas and gang! Xxx
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGILS MAKEUP ITS AMAZING I LOVE THE PURPLE-

Virgils eyeshadow that keeps  changing from black to iridescent purple is so fun . ~٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶
Prinxiety is a terrible combination when they actually manage to work together.
I love the eyeshadow at the end!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

"let's not waste this one" I FUCKING SCREAMED
IM LIKE DYING WITH HOW MUCH PRINXIETY MATERIAL THERE IS IN THIS VIDEO
I HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME AS NICO IM LOSING ITKSNSJSSJNS
Virgil: “is deceit going to be the answer to everything. Is that fair to him?”  Me: “Who? Janus or the guy?”
2:11 Did Thomas make a Galavant reference or did he just say "to do" weird...
WHEN VIRGIL"S HAPPY HIS BAGS TURN PURPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY HEART!!!!!!
You get me every single time...I m crying again.

This was so cute I stg🥺💖 also Virgil with the purple eyeshadow seems to signify happiness and I love for it

Wait... Roman x Virgil going canon there? Or am I seeing things owo
Thomas: *just posted a new vid* Me: *about to watch* My modules: not today
So sad
YEAH NEW VIDEO!!!
i love how Virgil’s eye shadow changes between black and purple it makes him look super happy
My brain: NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE- My body: I'm still tired, please be quiet (I dun swear UnU) My brain:  NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE NEW EPISODE- Me: Just a little reminder: Janus says to take care of yourself, would you wanna dissapoint him? No, so wake up again at another time. My brain: Fiiiiiiine My body: Yeyyyy! -Minutes later- My body: Aaaaand.. Now you're feeling slightly out of breath. Me: ... Seriously?
NICOOOOOOOOOOOOMG THIS IS AMAZING JFC I LOVE THIS SOOOOO MUCH HOLY MOLY EVEN THE ANIMATIC IS ASTOUNDING
SO SO SO I NOTICED THAT WHEN VIRG GETS ALL GLOOMY HIS EYESHADOW TURNS BLACK BUT WHEN HE'S HAPPY IT TURNS SHINY PURPLE AND I CAN'T--
I screamed when i saw the title
So is anyone gonna talk abOUT VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW AT THE END OR-
roman’s a himbo send tweet
So..... I think I cried....? This video hits so close to home.   I'm here because of Alex and he's been talking about this.. series so much and I never really looked into it until now. And uh.. this reminds me of all the times I've took a leap and failed.   All the times where i pushed down my anxiety and just.. *went for it.* But always failed. And it makes me so happy that this.. this is a thing.   Like sometimes you can takes leaps and you cane fail. But there is always a possibility that you *won't* fail, and it'll be alright.   So I cried.   :D
Everyone who ships Roman X Anxiety are probably fangirling especially at the end
:0
I need this story to be real!!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY?!?!?!?!?!?! AAAAAAAAH! THAT IS THE CUTEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
While everyone is talking about eyeshadow, Janus patrion and new content for the shippers I just wanna  mention that I am so happy that my boy Roman is oK. I was so scared after the last episode he would do something stupid
Ok are we not gonna talk about how at the end where anxiety is wearing purple eyeshadow, the MOMENT Thomas started talking about his tweet, anxiety says “delete it now” and his eyeshadow is black!!   like the black eyeshadow gets intense when Thomas gets more anxious.   damn that attention to detail
Finally a new video, AHHHHHHHHHHH coudn't get any gayerrr!!! XD
I love this, I want more of this, NOOOOWWWWWWW
As a fellow socially anxious gay it was painful to empathize so much. Loved it.
Bruh, how do you manage to shove my whole personality into *one aspect* of your personality? Am I that basic of a person?😹  And yes, I do also assume every random noise I hear out of nowhere is a demon, thank you for asking
plot twist: *the guy actually liked thomas and was trying to find out if he was gay by watching him closely with out him noticing*    okay but virgils new makeup tho-
IM ACTUALLY CRYING THIS IS SO SWEET
how did i just realise jun sounds like the voice of kirito inthe SAO abridged  also, fully into the metalic pruple 'eye bags' of happy virgil
OMG OMG I LOOOVE!!!!!
FINALLY PRINXIETY IS HAPPENINGGG
okay but this whole video just made me say "Oh my god that's me" like at least 349 times.
Do an anime fake or real with beyblade
I love Sanders sides
did anyone see Virgil's eye shadow change from purple, black then purple again
Prinxiety 🥺
So who else noticed virgil's purple eye shadow when he's super happy and excited, and it went back to black when he's not? Anyone?
Omg if I didn’t have sleep issues I wouldn’t know that this was a thing!
Three seconds into the animatic, there's not even flirting yet and the anxiety and cringe are already too real. I can already tell this is going to be amazing (and not just because I already know one of the artists and am confident the other two are just as awesome).
I love virgils eyeshadow changes when he's in love
I got so much second hand anxiety just watching this-  but ahhh as always it was amazing <3
Oh my I have been waiting T~T
Roman: *head empty no thoughts*
I looked and remus ,and Virgil is sold out
Virgil switches eye shadow when he’s ether exited and anxious
I am SO INVESTED
Ship time
I CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANT i love how virgils eyeshadow gets all purple and sparkly when he’s happy im gonna draw so much happy virgil now im dyiiiing
omg virgil's purple eyeshadow when he's happy is just BEAUTIFUL
ohmygoodnessohmygoodnesssohmygoodness!  Virgil's eye shadow is purple when he's all excited and happy, but then shifts back to that thiccccc black when he's anxious. And I just-  Chef's kiss* Love that detail, I can't wait to see more of that! My heart! Wah!! I also really liked, how he kept having Thomas happy stim, when I get super excited, my body has to do something! Not sure what, but something, I pretty much just squiggle around, chewing my bottom lip, etc.  The details and every little thing added for people to notice is go good!   And highest praise to the artists!! I follow all of them and I could tell who did which section <33
Yes ending songs
fAKIN VERGILS MAKE UP CHANGES COLOUR FROM BLACK WHEN HES A SAD BOI TO PURPLE WHEN HES NOT A SAD BOI AND I HDKDOAOAIAUAH
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.       Other than the other Thomas sander videos
me, seeing a new Thomas Sanders video: it's been 84 years...
i fell in love with someone too...but then i started getting panic attacks...and they got worse...and i mean like severe crippling kind of panic attacks...the common denominator was...my partner...the person i loved so much...the relationship ended...but now i still have horrible anxiety...if i end up seeing the name or end up thinking about this person...it almost feels like some sort of PTSD episode...all of this to say...i now regret ever falling in love...
PRINCEXIETY!!!!
I just wanted to know more about the guy in the washroom who didn't flush...
aaaaaaaahhhh!!! So Cuuuuute!!!  aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 I LOVED IT!!!! <3 <3 <3  Wholesome af. I love it soo much. I have had moments like this at work lol, i never know what to say, what to ask, or anything, this hits me hard lol.  I especially love how Virgil's eyeshadow turns different colors! That's so cool and cute, he's my favorite!! <3
JUST MAKE PRINXIETY HAPPEN ALREADY FOR REALS
Uhh
Omg Virg!!!
Virgil's changing eye shadow color at the end...
Anyone notice Virgil’s eye shadow change from purple to black at the end. This must mean something?
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
My anxiety was all over the place with the social situations in this video and I’m just watching XD
Did anybody notice that when Virgil worries his eyeshadow is black but when he’s excited it’s a pretty shade of purple?
okay so my heart is like sobbing this was the cutest thing ever🥺💖💘💘💕💘💘💖
Ok so I haven't really seen many of these videos, yet I just watched this entire animatic and just seeing that physical manifestation of fear holding me back is just wild, and seeing that there's a chance for me to get past it is incredible. And I haven't been in a relationship before, and don't really know where to begin with getting into one, so it gives me confidence in that too. Anyways. Thank you for helping. <3
Honestly, after spotting the pride pin, the John Malkovitch sticker was the perfect lead for an ice breaker. "Hey, this has been driving me crazy, what is the deal with that John Malkovitch sticker?? Do you just like him or am I missing a great meme?"
Im sure that's not the saying
BAGHAHAHAHHENEKKDB- i hate awkward moments (14:20)
a new sanders sides? on my birthday? featuring my favorite side? yes please!
THIS WAS SO CUTE OMF I LOVE IT SO MUCH DX
people that ship princiaty virgil x roman are going c͟r͟a͟z͟y͟ at the end. Sorry for saying this ǝɔɐǝd f͜͡l͜͡i͜͡p͜͡ y͜͡o͜͡u͜͡r͜͡ p͜͡h͜͡o͜͡n͜͡e͜͡ u͜͡p͜͡ s͜͡i͜͡d͜͡e͜͡ d͜͡o͜͡w͜͡n͜͡
He's gay
ME (WHO WAS JUST LISTENING TO HAMILTON): "I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD"
I literally cant stop smiling my face hurts 😂
Is that logan and roman was the one who sow him and fell in love
All I have to say is 16:57
THE AMOUNT OF SQUEALING I DID WAS ✨ASTRONOMICAL✨
Also like a few things I ain't seeing ppl talk about..  WE JUST WONT TALK ABOUT HOW IN THE END VIRGIL PUSHES THOMAS TO TALK WITH HIM WHEN THAT IS OBVIOUSLY OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE?! AND THE PURPLE EYESHADOW MMMMMM
I love it
highlights: virgil called roman "doofus" and im evaporating *gay eyes* crying toliet guy "plant???" virgil showed concern for janus VIRGIL OVERCAME HIS FEAR AFTER SEEING THAT ROMAN WAS UPSET we've been given the gift of nico ROMAN AND VIRGIL BLUSHING AT EACH OTHER ROMAN PUT HIS HAND ON VIRGILS SHOULDER "Bravery." "shut up emo" thomas roman and virgil fangirling together *purple eyeshadow virgil* anxiety stims !! thomas and co, we thank you for the luxurious amounts of Prinxiety you've given us on this fine day.
Im late but finally
True
Oh
Did anyone else see a prinxiety moment??
Omg prinxiety
Hell yes
Ha
Yay
Anyone who overanalyses this wanna tell me why virgils eyeshadow kept changing colours. Tbh its low key annoying me
Roman: what are you doing. Thomas: I dunno, plant??  That killed me XD
Help i feel bad for the guy in the restroom help
GOD DANGIT IF THIS DOESNT GET REMADE IN LIVE ACTION IMMA THROWING MY SELF INTO A TRASH CAN I KNOCKED OVER WHILE WALKING OVER TO A CUTE GUY
Time to make a comment that will never be seen! I was squealing along with everyone at the end...  THOMAS, DID YOU GET YOURSELF A BOYFRIEND? YOU GO!  And even if you didn't... well, thank you for giving the fans some Prinxiety 😪💕  And this beautiful animatic, somehow I love you and the sides more than ever. (No hetero) oh! And the artists... those expressions. I love it.    I'm really hoping Thomas got a boyfriend... and then we could all try to guess who would be top- And ship them and make fanfics and fan art of them and harass them if they ever broke his heart accept not really becuase that's not what he would want and I'm just SO excited, this might be my favorite episode of Sanders Sides but it would be close-
I MISS THIS SOOOO MUCHHH😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Anyone else notice how Virgil’s eyeshadow changed back and forth
22:33   I think Virgil is blushing and the color  of his blush is purple I'm not sure but it's adorable but this video gives me TOO MUCH PRINXIETY MOMENTS I CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE IT  the video is relatable though and I love it
😭😭😭😍😍😍❤❤❤😁😁😁😏😏😏
This was amazing i really liked seeing him and his sides in new places, and that monologue i mean COME ON!!!! *chefs kiss* perfection would awesome to see more animatics. Great Job!!!
This made me cry 😢 i loved it so much-
I LOVE ITTT KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK THOMAS ❤ ❤
the alternating color of virgil’s eyeshadow is so creative and utterly nerve-wracking when it goes back to deep black-
Flirting with your.. *what.*
I knew roman and virgil getting along would be utter chaos. This is the best ❤   ALSO THEY'RE SUCH A MOOD literally the personification of gay panic
Also, "rain on your black parade Gerard gay" I mentally made a note that I shouldn't scream into my pillow because it's 1:55 AM. The other song references too, I'm sorry, I'm ranting in your comment section. (Btw, your awesome. Anyway bye!)
I loved this so much! A lot of my anxiety is social so I can really relate lol. Also, Virgil's purple eyeshadow is so pretty!
literally the last two minutes described me (at the time the video came out) after i went out with this girl. just a spurt of virgil and roman hand flapping and all lol
OH MY GODDDD! THIS WAS AMAZING AND HONESTLY I WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO SEE MORE! AND THE PURPLE EYESHADOW?! I LOVE ITT!!! I WISH I COULD JOIN THE PATRON BUT I CANT BUT AHHHHH LOVE THIS SO MUCH I WAS GEEKING OUT ALL THROUGHOUT IT! Loved it so much I'm probably gonna watch this another 1000000000 times But this was amazing and wonderful and I loved it so so so SOOO much! ❤️🔶💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈💓💗❣️💖💕💘💞💝💟
This was so good!!
my life summed up in quotes: my peers: " what are you doing" me: "iunno ... plant?"
PRINXIETY!!!!!
VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE, I LOVE IT!!!!
I like how Virgils eye bags get darker as he calms down at the end and brightens back up as he gets excited
Thomas has found himself another gay Disney prince. You deserve to be happy.
This was adorably cute!!!!
Please we need that in real action
7:58 That's actually me... That just sums up my life...........            Thank you, good day.
My friend sent me the link to this video. I didnt know what it was, all I saw was the name. The first thing I said was "is this the key to finally get a girlfriend?" XD
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay"
Virgil’s purple eyeshadow 🥺🥺🥺💜💜💜
Heckin adorable!!
I was expecting Janus to pop up during the lying part. Just for a second. He would have been like? what what stop lying please! And virgil would start yelling because he doesn't know Janus is good yet.
I have to say I LOVE the animatics! I think the animatics are a great way for the stories until its safe to film again.
Virgil is starting to become Dabi.
I was really over here screaming with you
Thomas: something eventful happens in his life  Also Thomas: *lets go make some videos*
I love the castle on the table
You can’t end it on “are we ready for this” STOP THAT
Not to be dramatic but I'd do anything for Nico
I didn't know it was possibly but Virgil somehow got cuter. In other words, PURPLE GLITTER EYESHADOW
One think I will say is feeling gets muddle between the sides, it good but it hard to pin point where they are, or what charater there from, sometimes it feels like a type is under two characters
*_What are you doing?_*  Idk plant 🥺
They're stupid i love them
thomas why are u calling me out TuT
AAAAAAAAA- I FEEL LIKE THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS SCREAMING PRINXIETY AT MY POOR HAPPY HEART, IT WAS A COSTANT SCREAMING IN MY HEAD FOR 24 MINUTES, AND VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SWITCHING COLORS I JUST HHHHHH THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL❤️💜
17:13 Godddddd this was my favourite moment
Did anyone else notice Virgil's like... Dark eyeshadow was purple???? And it switched from purple to black at the end????? :000
I love Thomas calling Roman a punk
Ahhhhh Roman and Virgil ❤️❤️❤️❤️
*HDSKVSNAGSJFBAG VIRGIL IS WEARING PURPLE SHINEY MAKEUP*
THE EYESHADOW CHANGES FOR VIRGIL!!!      i am in love with it
OH MY GOD that was the most relatable video I've ever watched. I really want to find someone to love one day but I have NO CLUE HOW and I suck at talking to people XD
Give a like if you just want thomas to find his true love and live the happiest gay life ever🥺🥺
OK BUT IS NOBODY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END LIKE LITERALLY IS NO ONE GOING TO MENTION IT edit: THE PRINXIETY MOMENTS ARE KILLING ME 😃
Btw a littles less goss on the shadow, however it look appropriate with the events
So, when Virgil is happy/excited the black under his eye turns purple? I am I getting that right? Cause I love that concept!  Also, the animatic was fantastic! Nicely drawn and the everyone looked so cute. 😊
the entire second half of the video, my brain was just going: AHHHHHHHHHHH yes absolutly yup AHHHHHHHHHHHH perfect YAAAAASSSSs *second hand embarrassment* ahhhhhhhhh
THOMAS IN ANIMATION !!!! AGHHHHHHH *explodes*
Thomas why you always gotta make me SAD
The animation and plot is so adorable and I love it I might cry it’s so cute
*The end* NO NO NO I think you started a ship war Also I don't care but I LOVE this series also my favorite (My sides, the ones I fell most like) Patton, Virgil, *with like a disgusted taste in my mouth* Janus
Om flipping gosh this was so cute I hope so very much Thomas has this happen in real life
19:55 *I CAN HEAR THIS SHIPS DAILING FROM THE EEEEAST~*
Virgil: okay.....What are gay eyes?
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW !!!!!!!!!!!
this is me is the story of my life    that voice crack tho  20:09
I felt it when he said gay eyes😔    Edit: omg Virgils glittery purple eyeshadow. AMSBEJS. I SQUEALED
Soo theory on vigils make up change.  When it’s straight black he enters and is normal anxiety and paranoia. Meaning he has worry’s/debuts about everything and anything like “why does no one text me? Don’t the like me?” BUT HIS VIOLET SPARKLES ARE DIFFERENT! He had normal words that are positive. So when he is happy he fills Thomas with happy worry’s like “what if things are never the same?” He smiled afterwards. It’s a happy  worry  that his world will shift and will be happy and safe. Like how he feels with Thomas’s friends.
I just sat here for 30 minutes crying because I want to show support and become a Patreon but I know I can't afford it.
mmmmmmm boiled mayo carrots
Ok but why doesn’t he just compliment him on his pins that’s a perfectly normal thing
my prinxiety heart- the endddd
Love it love it love it love it love it!!
This is at 69k likes rn............ It's great
I love how at the end Virgil's eye makeup keeps changing from bright purple to black depending on how anxious he's feeling
yay new video
Man, Thomas has truly mastered the art of depicting anxiety. This whole time I was just sitting here going "Yup, mhmm, definitely done that. Definitely said those exact words to myself many, many times."
okay first both the art and the romance story is adorable and amazing second gosh I can relate to this one   when I see a cute guy I am awkward af and get so conflicted to talk to the cute guy so I feel this and know exactly how it's like ,it's accurate af   wishing you luck on how this story goes Thomas! also virgil with the pretty purple eyeshadow and the prinxiety my gosh!
This is adorable
"Final form" already a good start.
This is just feeding the Prinxiety shippers. Oh my god-
Honestly I'm kinda sad because this episode has soooo much Prinxiety in it and (no offense) but I .... strongly disagree with that ship, I personally prefer Analogical. I hope the next episode is focused on Logan and Virgil because everyone else has had multiple episodes of them getting along better except Logan and Virgil, who have only had like one.
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eye shadow got purple when he was happy and dark when he was stressed
AHHHHHHHH did you see Roman and Virgil at the end of the animation oh my God the ship is starting to board Roman looks so in love with Virgil did you see the hearts and stuff and the face it's so cute I love it I just realized I just fangirled also Virgil's eyeshadow is now purple nice touch
The shut up emo moment at the end was just adorable
i love the fact that the happier/more excited virg is, the lighter and brighter his eyeshadow is
So effing good. Nothing on youtube can make me smile, react and relate as much as Sanders does 😢
Omg this episode made me wanna cry, I felt this so much. Thanks for this episode Thomas 💕
My fav moments:  Roman: ugh, pintroverts. Roman: easy tiger Thomas: gay eyes? Roman: gay eyes. Thomas:idk.. Plant? Virgil: ABORT. aBoRt!!!! Roman: ... Did you not flush.? Virgil: HE FEARS THINGS TO!? Thomas: you saw me knock over that trash can didnt you. Roman: shut up emo.. All: AHHH Virgil: thomas im gonna need you to walk around the room Virgil: thomas, i-im gomna need you to shake your hands. Theyre just hanging there. Virgil:are you sure you dont need to pee?? Virgil: AAHH DEMON thank you for coming to my ted talk.
Not that one of them will see this but I would like to see the sides play Among Us, though I don’t know how it would work
Heheheheh I saw that little wink when he said guys
12:37 so what are we going to say, patton and roman *Logan* : You two, do represent his passion and heart
I felt really upset before watching this and now I can't stop sMiLiNgGggGgg-  Thomas just forces happiness upon me. I freaked out towards the end and tried to cover my mouth (because everyone is asleep) and I hit my new nose ring so now I'm crying for two reasons.
The animation is so good ahhhh
I love virgil’s sparkly under eye shadow!
I wanna keep suporting u in all ways
:0
"It's like cyber stalking, but *real life*  "Sooo, stalking?"  "Oh, YOU'RE RIGHT"  My brain every. Single. Day
Okay but, the guy's named NICO FLORES! MY LATINAMERICAN HEART IS VIBING IN REPRESENTATION!
Better then any show on Netflix
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS
Is no one going to talk about how Virgil Hass to care about Roman at least a little bit, because Virgil was pretty much completely on board with Thomas leaving the food court and not talking to the guy, sure he had doubts but overall he probably want to Thomas to leave. End it would’ve made sense if what had caused Virgil to push Thomas towards the guy(Nico) with simply he looks at Thomas, he looks at Roman, he looks back at Thomas, looks at the floor, back to Thomas and then pushes Thomas to Nico. But instead he looked from Thomas to Roman Thomas to Roman, and then continue to look at Roman until he felt bad to the point of freaking himself out, hyperventilating, and then pushing Thomas to Nico. And then when Roman put his arm on Virgil for a moment Virgil was scared and then he was calm, did you notice?
THIS....WAS......BEAUTIFUL!!! MY LITTLE HEART!! IT CANT TAKE IN SO MUCH!!!
😭😭😭😭 cute ahhh
1. Tell me this is real 2. During the sides gay panic if I was there I would be screaming louder than how me and my friend did after her brothers found us and that was very loud
I love how beautifully funny this is.  *Masterpiece*
Nice job virgil bringing it home
"You should've just said hi!" My heart! Sometimes it's easier just to breathe and realize people really aren't that scary
This is so pure and helped me learn how to talk to my girlfriend (I'm female) halfway across the country but I LOVE THIS. This is so awesome and I love it also. janus!
*me trying to see if my girl bestie is gay- SHES PAN ITS EVEN BETTER nwn*
We love this being my entire life
Virgil's eyeshadow changed from glittery to plain black at Thomas' subtweet.  Eyeshadow color based off of happy/axious!
😷❤️  When you don’t know what to write in the comments
THAT MOMENT AT THE END OF THE ANIMATIC MADE MY HANDS ALL LIKE: ⬅️↗️↘️↘️↙️↪️↖️⤴️ AAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS WAS SO CUTE IT MADE MY ENTIRE DAY😭😭😭😭😭 TYSM TO YOU AND YOUR ARTIST FRIENDS FOR MAKING THIS
my adorable emo child is back and he is still so good at his good I missed Virgil
I love everything about this
THE HEARTS BY ROMAN AAAH
Ok but... why is Roman here? Like, I get why Virgil is saying all the self deprecating stuff, cuz he’s anxiety but.... why is Roman doing it too? Why is he also being self deprecating? IM SCARED HELP. IS ROMAN OK??????!
This is super adorable, but my theoretical brain noticed that, from what I gather when feeling extreme happiness (or something close anyway) Virgil's eyeshadow was purple(after coming back from the trip), but as soon as the conversation got serious again (Thomas mentioning if he was actually ready for this) it turned black/gray again. Now, I don't have enough information to say if its any happiness at all or just extreme happiness but either way perhaps this can turn into something more. At the very least it has some angst fanfic possibilities. There's also the chance I might be looking to hard at this, in that case, oops.
4:32 IS HE GAY OR ERUOPEN OR THERE RIGHT THERE  AND OMG YESSSS LOVE
Omg that prinxiety moment my heart  is melting❤️❤️
VIRGIL WITH SPARKILY PURPLE EYESHADOW
YAYYYYY
Omfg I can't this is so much prinxiety and the little puns and quotes omg and virgils eyeshadow im absolutely floored and loving this my 2 baby's are getting along and they're so happy omg 🥺🤧❤💜😌😊 oh no something is gonna happen that ending though 🤨
bro... virgil's eyeshadow was beautiful!!! but why was it changing back and forth? So confused
"What are you doing?!?" "i dunno.... plant!"    Literally ME in a house party
Aww, I love it when Roman and Virgil work together.  <3
🌺🌺🌺🌺 🌺🌼🌼🌼🌺 🌺🌼☀🌼🌺 🌺🌼🌼🌼🌺        🌺🌺🌺🌺           🌱           🌱🍃           🌱          .🌱        Here is a flower for being my idol!
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay" 😂🤣
The anxiety is too real ahhhhhhjhjhj
Ok I love Roman in this omfg but this video makes me uncomfortable because it highlights so many of the same insecurities that I have but I just can’t urge myself to be honest even when the stakes are so high.  Edit: also I love Roman calling him Gerard Gay omfg
“If I am then I’ll add it to the list!” Like! Roman! No! 😭
"You can join our. . ."  Me: Ohnoes.  "Patreon!"  Me: *cries in broke student*
Oh my god oh my god oh my god Virgil's eyeshadow changes when he's overwhelmed with GOOD FEELS
viRGILS EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HES BLUSHINGNDWIKSNSJOAKF ?!????!!?!
Ok but it seemed like Virgil was about to say something at the end but got distracted.. WHAT WAS HE THINKING???
Ahhhh I love that Alex did the animation!! He’s so talented
Is no one else noticing Virgil's PURPLE EYE SHADOW?!?!?!?! IT'S USUALLY BLACK PEOPLE!!! Then it turns BACK TO BLACK when something stressful happens, like the tweet or making plans or he starts worrying. Then the eye shadow is PURPLE when he's excited and asking about stiming. We already knew his eye shadow turns DARKER when he's more stressed, so what if it turns PURPLE when he's very happy/excited and there's barely any actual anxiety?  *fander soul leaves body*
so when virgil's jazzed his eyebags turn purple? i love
What
22:21 - End. My favorite part of this episode! (No hate on the Animatic or idea! I just couldn't personally follow the story in that format and ended up skipping sections.)  Thank you, Thomas and the entire Sanders Sides team!
I love love love this! Defiantly my favorite Episode!!! And I sense some Princxiety~
wait virgils eyeshadow changes colors
Two awkward nuggets being adorable for 24 minute
IS THOMAS TALKING TO SOMEONE?!? Awwwwwwww🥺🥺
Can we talk about Virgil's face at the end after Thomas said, "Are we ready for this?"  Like, what was that eluding to?
sums up my entire internal dialogue when I see a pretty girl and I go into full lesbian anxiety attack mode
Virgil's eyeshadow is so pretty!
Thomas: giving this speech in the bathroom Me: I'm waiting for that dude to be watching him           Looks like Thomas is making prinxiety happen
Happy Virgil is my new hyperfixation
*cries in lonely broke smol being*
10:07 my social anxiety anxiety is killing me
This video was 24 minutes of relatableness
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how fluid and flawless this animation is? It's so smooth that you almost forget that it's not a full animation!
is no one gonna talk about the eyeshadow
Finally yyy
For what ever reason, seeing virgil be brave made me cry. He's just grown so much as a person, as a side. It just makes me so happy.
OMG
I love Virgil’s coping mechanisms lol!  “Thomas I need you to walk around the room!”  Haha I laugh so hard at that! I do that all of the time!
Roman and Virgil having an enemies to lovers relationship
this is cute ^u^ plus snek I A SIMP FOR HIM
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!! I love the animation!!
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT SWEET LITTLE MOMENT WOTH VIRGIL AND PRINCEY AT THE END OF THE ANIMATIC-  these bois make mE SOFT
I loved this so much, I was so devastated when I thought Thomas had lost his chance and I legit cried when they started talking, this is definitely my favorite sander side so far
the blink-182 ref. i love it
Them: "GAY EYES" Me: "Could you repeat that?"
I didn't know Virgil watched Euphoria
This made me so freaking happy 😍 watching everything unfold. Honestly, the moment they started talking it was like I could breathe again 😂 this was really well done
17:17 This scene is great, but imagine this: Instead of a push, it was a drop kick
Is virgil's eyeshadow changing a hint at something in the future or are you guys just trying something new?
Omg 22:40 Lookit that purple shimmer!! Edit: Aw no. What? Bring the purp back!
This is beautiful 🥺 I felt so happy watching this...  sorry to the guy in the bathroom though.
Is this a prinxiety tease or what ? ⬇
This is so cute, omg-
OH MY GOD IT WORKED  YES  ITS ALL GREAT
why does virgils eye shadow change from black and purple?? 👀
“Hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay” I cant believe Roman called Virgil an angel  MY BOYS I was smiling like an idiot the whole time, the purple eyeshadow looked amazing
VIRGIL!!! The demon comment at the end😂💜
Nico: "mr. flores, very formal of you uhh, you can call me nico if you like"  me: wait......MY FRIEND IS NAMED NICO FLORES!!
Ohhh my gOD. Virgils eyeshadow changes based on if it’s happy anxiety or bad anxiety and I’m 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 THIS IS ALL I WILL THINK ABOUT FOREVER
Oml- Thomas posted this on #NationalComingOutDay. Twitter is full of it. Is this a coincidence or a well timed post??? XD
I'm your 69k like button ;)
Virgil's makeup keeps changing
VIRGIL SWITCHED EYEDSHADOW IM SCREAMING I LOVE IT
18:58 I had forgotten about the Trash incident so this was doubly funny for me. ^-^
Is no one noticing the Radiohead reference??? Roman:You're a creep, you're a weirdo- *Thomas jumps into the line* Virgil:What the hell are we doing here?
*happy gay noises*
WAIT WAIT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW FOR A SEC??? I think when Virgil’s happy his eye shadow goes from black to purple. I might be wrong BUT I LOVE THE EYE SHADOW AND HAPPY VIRGIL💖💖💖
I just cried after watching this video. Great content as always.<3 Love how you touch hearts with your videos and words.
I’m sorry but 270k views in 13 hours should not get on trending
Wow this made me tear up and realize that I’m a coward and very very alone😂😔
At the part where Virgil shoved thomas towards Niko it came to me that since Virgil is a fight or flight reflex he chooses flight almost all the time, and this is one of the moments where he chose fight
Love virgils new happy eye shadow
I was just waiting for patton to jump out and saying something like "Why didn't you just ask me?!"
This is so cute totally worth the wait
Omg if you get a boyfriend I'm supportive and I world latterly scram of joy
Thomas: It's true. I do tend to waste a lot of opportunities in my life. Nic/ko: Well, let's not waste this one Roman: Shut up. Virgil: Shut up. Roman: SHUT UP! me: SHUTUP!SHUTUP!SHUTUP!SHUTUP!OMG!OMG!OMG!OMG!!!!
Oh my god please tell me Virgil’s glittery eyeshadow is staying and him and Roman are going to become a canon duo!!!  Also are we not going to talk about Virgil being on board to plan a romantic trip to France with Roman?
My favorite part was when Virgil saw Roman upset and literally did whatever he could to make him happy.  Prinxiety shippers everywhere are dying with joy.
My mother: How do you know if you’re gay if you haven’t been with a guy yet?  My inner anxiety that boils over every time I see a guy I like: 👁👄👁
Thomas is the only YouTubed I will do patron for, cause he’s worth it
Wish that was true. Fully animated version maybe?!
Roman: "Shut up, emo" * *lingering shoulder touch* * Virgil: * *purple eyeshadow intensifies* *
Love this. I understand anxiety, it wants to keeps you save from being hurt but sometimes it becomes fearful of losing something that hasn’t happened yet that it pushes you in the right direction
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE VIDEO EVER OMGGHDHEHBEBBWVS I CANT WAIT TO SEE A LIVE ACTION VERSION HAHAHHJDBDBDBBE NICO IS THE CUTEST AND NICO REMINDS ME OF ME  OMHRHDHBDHEBBEBEBHEBEBRBBEBBRRBB
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGINGTO PURPLE WHEN HE IS EXCITED/HAPPY????????
I love this
WHY IS NOONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW FSKJDFSK-
oh my god- I was on a call with my friend while watching this, and when we figured out his name was nico, my friend said "nico nico nii!" so, as per usual, I said "kid, if you don't shut up I'll break your nico nico kneecaps"
i cant do gay eyes anymore bc of the stoopid rona >:(
AAAAAAAAAAAHHH OOOOMMMMGGGGG
12:43 Roman: Thomas, you’re gonna have to try... speaking from your heart- The ad that played: “O p e n  u p.”
Why do I think Thomas is Asexual ??? Virgil : No he's scared Thomas :No I am not  Virgil & Roman : then try not to think about $e×  Thomas : oh hell no  Me: Haha I knew it
THE HEARTS 19:59
The art is lovely!!
10:46 “what- what are you doing-?” “i dunno.. plant!😃”
I love this episode so much
I may just be wayy to obsessed with Sanders Sides but if this isn't a prinxiety ship confirmation or at least slightly, then I'm so confused, cause the looks they gave each other, like, ahhhh
Did anyone else notice the gay tension between Roman and Virgil at the end? Just me? Okay.
I love that virgils eyeshadow goes purple when hes positively anxious and return to black when hes negatively anxious. thats an adorable touch.
HES BACK! _happy noises_
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYE  SHADOW IS GORGEOUSSSSSS
THE PARAMORE REFERENCE HES
10:46 I don’t know plant
THAT MOMENT WITH VIRGIL AND ROMAN WAS SO CUTE IN GOING TO DIE FROM CUTENESS
theory  if his nervous or being who he is his eyeshadow go dark and when his confident or not being anxiety his eyeshadow is light purple with white under it,maybe virgil is being more as a light side, and as for janus we notice his also getting stronger bc thomas keeps lying now and ro and virge are nervous no one willtrust him anymore
ooohh i love virgil's under eye changing colors at the end based on the good anxiety vs. bad anxiety
I CANT EVEN TELL WHICH IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THE ART OR THIS ROMANCE STORY
Welp, imma just die with the interaction around 11:15
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OOOOOOHHHHHHH MMMMMMYYYYYYYY GGGGGGGOOOOOOOOODDDDD! *internal monologue*
THAT WAS SO FREAKING CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE I LOVED THAT SO FREAKING MUCH AND THAT HIT SUPER CLOSE TO HOME *whispers* I’ve fallen into a trash can to try to learn some stuff about my now known as boyfriend- but like yo I literally felt that I loved this I hope to see more like this soon!
This was the greatest thing ever I need the live action
AAAAAAA AAA A A A A I LOVE THIS SO BLOODY MUCH!!!!!! THANKYOU!!!!!! HOLY MOTHER OF H E C K THIS SPARKED SO MUCH JOY!!!!!!!!
“he’s better off without me” ...bruh he wouldn’t EXIST without out

20:41 Janus C👁️rrid👁️r Rewards of Stored
That was..SO MAGICAL.
ANXIETY GOT PURPLE GAY EYES
Animation begins at 2:24
Thomas says: Prinxiety shippers go brr
I love absolutely everything about this, the plot, the style it gives me so much hope for my future
Why did I think this would be people flirting with Virgil
Watched this three times today……  I’m not dying…… I’m just drowning in the gay. Don’t worry.
purple eyed happy anxiety!!!!!!!
Why was *I* getting second hand embarrassment?! AGSISBDISNWOQNSJDB
I belive this will look really really amazing in live actioun plus that touched me in the heart
22:55  “Huh... *delete it* “
SO FRICKING CUTE!!!
tHaT LiMiTeD JaNuS sHiRt IS BEAUTIFUL AND I REGRET TO SAY THAT I CAN’T HAVE IT BUT I WANT TO EXPRESS MY LOVE FOR IT ANYWAY; I LOVE THAT SHIRTTTTTT!!!! 💛💛 (it looks kinda like the Eye of Sauron lol)
where are the comments on virgils undereyes changing with mood?
more of this please omg<3 i was so nervous and excited for the whole vid
this entire video was just [cups hands over mouth] WE GET IT YOU'RE A THEATRE KID GO GET YOUR MANS
as soon as i saw ABDillustrates i knew this was going to be incredible XD
NOOOOO I DONT HAVE MONEY
The pure gay panic they had is amazing
This is so gay and i freaking love it...i mean...obviously but still...i love how romantic/adorable this is. As a pansexual awkward individual, this hit me hard. Almost as hard as I hit a street sign when trying to ask out my first gay crush...im dead serious. I was a mess. Long story short, this whole video may seem unrealistic or only for entertainment but it is very close to the experiences ive had. Its a chaotic ride, that love.
I love this video so much, it was really cute and funny as well ❤️ the animation!
19:54 *GAY PANIC*
This is so beautiful 😫❤🧡💛💚💙💜
19:53  Virgil: Are we about to kith 👁👁
Love how virgils dark eyesadow turns a light purple when blushing
BE STILL MY BEATING HEART!! <3
Stay safe Thomas and Friends!
Omg ship ship ship and also princey is falling for a little emo baby!!!!! 😭♥️♥️♥️
ummm can anybody help me and ask thomas to play Persona 5 Royal? 👀 (but if you guys don't want to, its okay!)
SO CUTE!! And new Virgil makeup! <3
So your gay???
Awwww I loved this video so much! I'd love to see more of these!!!🥰❤
Thomas I give you my love and support because I’m have a lot of love to give... and am broke. But I have a big heart!
THE SWITCH FROM THE PURPLE EYESHADOW TO THE BLACK WHEN VIRGIL STARTED TO SPIRAL OMG THE D E T A I L S
No one:  Me: MOM! ...  “CAN YOU GIVE ME 25 DOLLARS”
Vigil is soo happy that his eyeshadow is purple
Gay panic attacks
PURPLE EYESHADOW MEAN HAPPY VIRIL??
You know it's a good video when you pause to process emotions. Not that this wasn't chaotic enough with Roman and Virgil at odds, but where the heck was Logan?!?! I feel like he would have been a good mediator... no? Just me? Great.  I LOVE IT! Anxiety got so anxious he did the unthinkable opposite and was brave and it turned out beautifully!
Best video uploaded on my birthday ^w^
Purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyeshadow purple eyesha-
The boys are back
How can someone explain my life in a nutshell without knowing me.
AHHHHHHH!!!! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊he’s adorable~~~
I'm watching this again
I find your lack of Janus in this episode disturbing.  In all seriousness this was a super wholesome episode that expertly captures how social anxiety feels when it’s keeping you from doing something you desperately want to do. And seeing Janus be such a prevalent force in this episode despite not actually making an on screen appearance just makes me even more excited to see Thomas and the rest of the crew figure things out. I do have to say it’s interesting that Roman seems so... not upset in this episode? Like, the last we saw of Roman he seemed totally crushed and betrayed. Is the idea just that he’s lying to himself in this?
The whole video I was yelling at the screen like nooo! and then like yesss! Definitely want to see this live-action.
I can describe  this is to words *gay panic*  also thomas love this
Right in the end card after Thomas says “Are we ready for this?” And Roman says “If he’s ready we’re ready” the camera cuts to Virgil in dark eyeshadow thinking about something
Is Prinxiety cannon?
OMGGGG IIIII I LOVE
Virgil eyeshadow change make my hart sing 🥰 22:35
virgil: *has a panic attack and pushes thomas*   Roman: hUh?-
This entire video was just a representation of gay panic and you can't tell me toherwise
I'M JUST GONNA SCREAM
?????? Bravery Sanders? Perhaps so?*insert Janus' theme song*
Im so happy this came out ive been kinda bored and i told my mom im nonbinary and she said she still loves me and that i would always be her daughter and i have been listening for her to use they/them and i heard her use she today and when i told her i had an emotional breakdown 30 times a day that day and I managed to get away with blaming it on my allergies and i wouldve corrected her but it was in front of someone i don’t exactly consider close, my grandma, and a stranger. I managed to prevent emotional breakdown. But i loved this episode keep up the great work and whoever read all of this deserves some Crofters.
virgils eyeshadow going purple and sparkly ❤️
Roman is me in a nutshell  Roman: *gay panic* Me: *bi panic* Roman: *gay eyes* Me: *finger guns* Roman: *Disney* Me: *INTO THE UNKNOWNNNNN*
I was grinning like an idiot at the end.
the secondhand gay panic i had through this whole video
I avoided watching this for 12 hours because I thought I was going to be ripped to shreds when I’m already having a mental tough time, finally decided to watch it bc I wanna talk to my mutuals about the episode. Turns out, this is the first thing to make me smile besides Pattonin a skirt (and before that, probably like a month)
did you spy on me or do all gays with social anxiety live the same life
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING!!!!
Imma just ask cos imma do it probably stupid question. Is this a true story? Cos if so it's so cute.
This is just Thomas Gay panicking       Honestly mood
I actually loved this animatic episode its really cute and funny  you should make more of them as well of the regular but as long as it works with your schedule too
You are amazing this video was so cute
Me:*smells a double ship*               Me:WHO SUMMONED ME!!!!-
Fucking amazing makeup work on Virgil. The changing eye shadow when he's a good anxious vs bad anxious was a great touch.
This was a rollercoaster of emotions damn
I- MY HEART AHSVSNSBS
I’m dying form this amazing video Thomas I love your videos so much
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY SHIP PRINXIETY IS BECOMING REAL!!!!
So cute
I live for this ending and I love the thing where virgils makeup thingy is a shiny purple when he’s like super happy and it’s amazing and I’ve been waiting for another one of these for forever and Thomas is amazing and yeah I need to stop lol
Roman and Virgil were very unlikable in this episode.
This is *SO* like parts work with therapy!
I never knew anxiety was this bad
Virgil: I wasn’t testing you. I was just panicking.  Virgil: No. The UNIVERSE tested you. *And you chose to be a liar...*  Virgil is just as dramatic as Roman and I love it.
Yeyyyyy he's back
MY HEART-
im a lil disappointed that Logan didn’t show up with his vocab cards and just go “shoot your shot. as they say.” shdidjdh fr tho i love this sm
5:18 DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME I MEAN YOU’RE ALREADY THE VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD     Just a happy blink 182 fan here don’t mind me 😌
GOD DAMN IT IF THIS ISNT A REAL STORY
This was honestly the best thing I have seen, I love my dark strange sons character development 💜💜
Now I wanna know more about what’s happened with this guy ;v;
I want to join the Patreon so bad but im 13 and dont have money
My heart omg it hurts it’s so buful
I’M NOT INTO SANDERS SIDES BUT NOW I AM VERY INVESTED IN THIS VIRGIL GUY-
Ngl one of my favorite parts of this video was the bathroom scene, but specifically because of the man who cried, that's was adorable and hilarious. Tho as a somewhat artist I also really appreciated the effort put into the mirror reflections, those can be tough at times since the angle is weird
OMGOSHH this is sooo cute <3
So I guess this adds fuel to the ships for Virgil and Roman? I'm not complaining
"Idontknow... Plaaaaaant"
No one’s talking about Virgil’s eyeshadow!! Look at it!!
They keep saying 'Liar'-  They really don't like Janus huh?  Also- That was the most Prinxiety momment I have ever seen-
i feel like i just watched a fanfiction
THIS GAVE ME SO MUCH SOCIAL ANXIETY WHAT THE HECK
tbh i prefer this animatic style.
thank u for posting with on my birthday
It’s like cyber stalking but in real life Soooo...stalking YoU’RE RIGHT
Honestly these are the same issues I have as the only lesbian in my area
The Prinxiety energy radiating from this episode is /immaculate/! And I’m living for it!  Update: I’m currently sitting in my pantry, eating wheat thins, and contemplating my mental state. I have borderline compulsive lying disorder and rely a lot on my own Deceit. This has made me try and rethink a lot of things. It really helped.  Edit #2: On a happier note, Virgil and Roman gave each other the gay eyes, so *eeps in lgbtq+*
havent been this happy to see a new video is ages XD  i looked down and had to see the date O-O its sooo good :3 and welcome back thomas!!
OMG
There were places where I related a lot to,  had to pause the video several times, and felt a tad bit targeted.
IM HAPPY STIMMING SO HARD RN
The lack of Patton and Logan in this episode upsets me
I LOVE THAT WHEN VIRGIL GETS EXCITED HIS EYE SHADOW GOES PURPLE!!
Me wanting to try and support but can't afford it and can't do anything to support but watching and liking his videos: 👁👄👁
Ok but when Roman put his hand on virgils shoulder and said shut up emo I literally happy squealed and shook out of excitement!
Prinxiety is real!!!
Yes. That's it . That's the tweet
I'm LOVING the purple eyeshadow and all the band references 💫💕💜
lol what’s up with the constant eyeliner change at the end there?
Roman I thought of something to fill in your rhyme. Oh beauteous bard in the court of food, can’t wait to date this adorable dude. Huh? Huh? Nvm lol
THIS IS MORE MOVING THAN MOST MOVIES AND IM LIVING FOR IT!!! ITS FREAKING MIDNIGHT AND IM HOLDING BACK SCREECHES!!
I love the eye-shadow change tho... PRINXIETY IN ACTIONNNN. I am fangirling over all of thissss. Wonder what was going on either Patton and Logan... Can't wait for the next episode. And I soon agree with the mistake list... Thanks Thomas!
OMG I LOVE THIS
This is my new favorite Sander Asides! I would love to know more about the artists who did this because it was incredible! And I’m not sure but was saying “ you need to speak from the heart” a reference to Patton?
Virgil nooo- I want your cute eyeshadow back like damn that made me so happy
DUCK YEAH!
The dog was not agreeing with the intro
This Is Just JDBSKSVSJHDBSJDBSJDB
So i kind of misunderstood the title. I thought it was going to be Roman and Virgil flirting 👉👈 still happy though      Edit: THE PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!
Yessss the new episode
Could of been gayer
This is an amazing episode. Great job to Thomas and the rest of the team.
Wait...So the binoculars worked on the stickers but not the pins?
I have a question for everyone. Was it me or at  the end did virgils I nder shadow keep changing from purple to black and back?
I could call this cute i could call this perfection I could call this so any thing's and it still be an understatment.
Aaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aweee
....*cough*.......    *Why does Pinstranger look like Joan?*
6:49 RADIOHEAD REFERENCE!!!! IM A CREEP!!! IM A WIERDO!!!!
HIS EYESHADOW IS P U R P L E
What mic did u use to record ur voice acting?
Virgil is basically my gay panic every single time
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGILS EYE SHADOW OMG AAAAHHH
HESBACK
"He's in his 30, he might as well be 60".      -Roman 2020
Gerrard Gaayyyyyy
I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS OUT
I LOVE VIRGIL'S MAKEOVER!!!
This gave me gay panic through the screen
HIS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN EXCITED OR HAPPY AND IM LIVING FOR IT
🙂 This... is such a mood...🙃
Virgil is the cutest thing ever-
Guys!!!! When Virgil was happy, his eyeshadow changed to purple!! 😍
Hey Thomas  Just wanted to say thanks for all of the content. You are really great at helping us all be motivated, Learn about ourselves and have a laugh.  Just wanted to say thanks. You should be proud of yourself.
Virgil is babey
11:01 Ok Jacksepticeye  Also the ending Roman and Virgil is exactly how I reacted to this video. So good and always worth the wait. Sorry I cannot do Patreon, I’m a broke ass college student. The most I can give is finally subscribing. Thank you though, your videos always make me feel better and evaluate my mental health and goals so I can get better myself. Thank you
Janus
THOMAS.. I SWEAR I LOVE YOU SO FREAKING MUCH BUT IF YOU DON’T MAKE SURE VIRGIL AND ROMAN GET TOGETHER-
Thank you for the free serotonin, this whole video is going to be all I talk about for the next several months. (Virgil's eyeshadow? That "bravery" moment? The emotion that radiates from the mirror monologue? I'm DECEASED.)
Wait, Thomas has new bf or is that just an actor? Either way ill be happy for him. He's my gay son
I can NOT stop smiling. This video was so CUTE with the way it was animated and drawn and the lines and the EVERYTHING. I just LOVE THIS.   Also at the same time of being happy and the non stop smiling i got really hot, i think maybe because when i was watching i was imagining me in that situation also, and I get very anxious in those situations so..) anyone else feel that or just me?  BUT I LOVE THIS ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
That was too cute! I’m crying!
WHY DOES THE “Shut up Emo’ AT THE END MAKE ME FEEL SO SINGLE
I kind of want to join da patreon TwT
The amount of second hand embarrassment and anxiety 😂 it was worth it though
SQUEEEEEEEE
Me:Playing with my cousins Thomas:*Post a new sanders sides video* Me:*Yeets everything I'm doing out the window* The god has spoken!!! Still Me:*Watching before notices it has just Virgil and Roman* Prinxiety!!!! *One video later* me:*Laying on the floor while squeeling in gay loudly* I so ship it!!!
IS ANYONE ELSE GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW!!!!!
6:29 WHY DO THEY HAVE 5 MICROPHONES
Did anybody else notice that Vigil's eyeshadow was changing from purple to black? I feel like that means something.
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen! I hope this is a true story. If it is, good luck building something amazing with Nico!
i felt so much panic just watching this. it realy made me think,  maybe i shouldnt be so ready to give up on myself.  great vid, you guys did a great job
I'm so gay for this man guys I can't  Such a wholesome and SUUUUPER HARD HITTING video! I relate to having social anxiety and approaching cute people in public constantly and it feels like we're having an internal battle constantly. (Btw, we're a system of alters. It's also kind of why these Sander Sides videos hit so close to home as well.)
Coming from someone who is an extrovert this was increasingly painful to watch. I loved it
Im guessing this is like not related to the actual series-
That was some prinxiety fluff if I haven't heard of it...and possibly a little angst ¬w¬
It's like he glamorizes and tries to make being "awkward" his whole being and personality, jeezus christ it's going to be so sad to see him still like this at 40 which is not that far.
My prinxiety!!!! ❤❤❤❤
I love how much Virgil smiled at the end 😄
i didnt even get a notif-
"Are there any other NON-VERBAL methods?" Me: GAY HAND.. GAY. HAND!
Did anyone think at first this wasn't a canon episode and it was just prinxiety? Just me?
VIRGILS EYESHADOWNIS ADORSBLLEEEE
Thomas.....HOLY MOLY IDK WHY BUT MY COMFORT SHIP IS BACK          Not gonna lie, I literally jump off a bed and squeal with them for the Whole 24 minutes and 13 seconds....
Anyone else notice how virgils eyeshadow went from purple to black? In love to not?
OMG OMG Virgils eyeshadow changes depending on what mood he's in!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT
THE KING IS BACK
No one:  Not a single soul:  Not even Muscle Man's mom:  Not even- okay, just shut up:  Thomas: No think, only...    *Nico Florés*
me: EEEE I LOVE THIS- I RELATE TO IT SO MUCH! me: a little to much… me: wait a damn second-
ASDKLJFKASLJFKLDSJAFKL MY HANDS HAVEN'T FLAPPED LIKE THIS IN SO LONG OH MY GOD THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEROTONIN I NEEDEDFKJASJLDKAJFKDJAJKFJK
virgil in LNTAO: "but when you lo- CARE for someone, nothing hurts more than their scorn."  virigil in asides: got brave and pushes thomas after seeing roman
I AM SCREAMING
Prinxiety fans:   SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Everyone’s commenting about Gerard gay but is no one going to comment about how both Virgil and Roman blushed when they had their own moment and Roman had hearts around him????
Wait wait wait Virgil's new glitter look??? And then switching back to his Anxiety eyes when he got nervous??? Are we seeing Virgil begin to metamorphasis into a new aspect of Thomas? Is, as Thomas's life improves, Virgil's role changing enough that he's beginning to represent something entirely different? Could all the dark sides undergo something similar?
THIS IS SO CUTE AND GAY AND UGGGHHH <3333!!!!
OH MY GOD THIS IS MY FAVOURITE THING
Imagine if this was the prequel to getting over it.
Looks like jocat with a beard
YESSSS I NEEDED A HAPPY EP, THIS IS EVERYTHINGGGGG
all the artist in this fandom: im gonna draw an alternate scene were roman and virgil flirt and kiss
So if Thomas is Gay . Does that mean all the sides are gay 😃
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! A video! My day is complete.
I just noticed how Virgil’s eyeshadow turn from pastel purple into dark purple- like when he is really excited is light purple AHHHHHH That’s SO cUte
Do you ship any of the sides example PRINXIETY and the others ya know but mainly PRINXIETY😄😁
the whole episode i was just fangirling with them i cant even-
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OH MY SUJEZMFNAKXKS
Anyone else notice that when Virgil was happy his eyeshadow was purple? That’s so adorable!
An artist Youtuber that i watch (Alex/ABD Illustrates) and an acting YouTuber that i watch collabed this is wild.
“What are you doing...?”  “U-uh plant?”  Why is that me?
Funny story: I was scrolling through Instagram like the lovely loner I am when I stumbled-well....scrolled upon a post showing spoilers for a new episode. The moment I saw it I actually threw my phone and scrambled to get a tablet so I can actually see the video (why did I think it would be a great idea to stare at the sun again?), I was not expecting this but I'm not disappointed.
Omygod this is amazing!!!
This is probably my favorite episode to date this was So So Good oh my GOD
I love how Thomas said story line cause that makes it easier in my mind to handle all the angst in the Sander Sides videos causs it's a story, but basie's with really issues and stuff, and I just love it-  Side Note- Thomas, why you gotta throw a bunch of angst at us in the normal episodes? It hurts-but it's good to and *confused screaming*
10:36 poor Thomas 16:11 gay panic
Prinxiety moment?   im just saying this was way to wholesome and gay like- I love it- <3
:O did y'all notice virgil's eyeshadow changing from a pearly purple (when he's like, happy anxious) to coal black (when he's ANXIOUS anxious)?
MY HEART
Yaaaassssss a new Sanders sides vid!!!!!!!!
Virgil’s eyeshadow turns a glittery purple when he’s happy/excited?? ADORABLE
When are you gonna partnership with crofters again?
6 minutes in and I'm realising I'm a pintrovert. I adore pins!!! And have a whole collection from fave youtubers, books, and movies to simple things like a paw print and one that just says nerd TwT
Why is no one talking about the fact that his name is Nico?
WHEN VIRGIL'S HAPPY HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW?????? THAT'S THE COOLEST FRICKIN THING EVER!!!!!!!
Roman: STOP PLAYING WITH PEOPLE’S HEARTS TOMAS- Me: *chuckles* tell that to Janus-     nope no never mind I’m evil I’m cruel I should NOT have said that plz forgive me-
EYESHADOW
Virgil... has purple eyeshadow! When he’s happy! He had black eyeshadow a few times when he became more nervous/sadder, but it was otherwise purple sparkly! Wow!
VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES OMG IM DONE THIS IS AMAZING AND SO CUTE!
Cute
Thomas is back i have been waiting for a ling time and i miss this i am sad TvT
Im ded and that was awsome, not gonna lie at the end I didnt know if roman had little hearts because of the guy or because of virgil ;) Yes I ship that dont judge meh please😅😅😢😢
that...was fluffing adorable!!  omg mah heart! TwT
ARE WE SLEEPING ON THE PURPLE EYESHADOW
*me sees the title* me: prinxiety fans are gonna have a lot of fun with this one....
Any one else surprised thomas is in his 30s cause I thought he was in his early 20s
Wait,dose Thomas have a boyfriend now?
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S NEW EYE SHADOW  ITS ALL PURPLE AND GLITTERY IT"S PERFECT
So glad to see you posting another of these!
wow,,, this episode hit close to home. I've just started going to a new school and none of my old friends are here with me and it's been so hard to find new friends, I've seen people wearing hoodies or sweaters with shows on them that I like, people with pins similar to my interest and other stuff like that, but I just can't make up the courage to get up and talk to them...
AAAAAAHHH THIS SO CUTE X3
WHY IS VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW SWITCHING BETWEEN NORMAL AND PURPLE
Ok so my friend pulled me away from my phone all day so I didn't get to finish but this video gave me a feeling or perspective/theory  What if the reason V and Ro are fighting over this because they're having problems with their relationship. (Prinxiety angst ppl) And when Thomas speaks from the heart, that's when they act the way they do.  Keep I haven't finished the video yet, I'm only at 13:52
The ship is real

NOOOOO I WANT THAT SHIRT SO BADLY BUT I'M BROKE :(((

Happy Virgil is amazing!
Did anyone else notice Virgils eyeshadow change at the ending? It's purple when he is happy, and black otherwise.
Roman touched virgil and virgil blushed
if I could like this a hundred times I would!
Ah yes, the gay struggle

16:07- 16:41  My thoughts arguing and freaking out. 😂
PRINXIETY CONFIRMED MY DUDESSSSS
*I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS I CANT BELIEVE IM 11 HOURS LATE I FEEL REALLY SAD!!!!!!!!*
Reeee I’m leaving this comment for no reason
This videos been up for less than 12 hours and I've watched it 4 times already hhh I need help
This changed my life u have no clue what I go though
For some reason I totally ship Virgil and Roman
'Pintrovert'. My new favourite word, thanks to the power of Sanders Sides.
I can feel the gay panic-
ok but can we make putting stickers on your laptop the new lgbt code XD
I AM GOING TO CRY! I CANT JOIN PATREON AND I LOVE JANUS! I DONT WANT TO MISS ANYTHING! NOOOOOOOOooo
Hey let’s talk about Virgil new I shadow I like
So like--  Nico asked if he was gay.  Incase any of you guys were wondering.. You're welcome.
I've never purposefully flirted with anyone in my life but this video somehow perfectly described my internal monologue and actions when I'm around people. Complete with sneaking around trying to guess things about others because I'm too anxious to talk to them yet and second guessing literally everything I do. So 10/10 depiction of social anxiety.
So when Virgil is happy/excited anxious his eyeshadow is purple, but will switch to black once he goes back to normal anxious. This is amazing!!! Character development!!! We've never seen this side of Virgil!!!
I was fanboying this entire episode. Why? 1. Prinxiety! 2. Lego Castle in the Background! 3. Virgil's back! 4. Patreon! 5. New Virgil lore  Also, my anxiety also kicked in while sending this message, but I don't care!
All I have to say is... ADORABLE. That animation was so good and cuteee
Why the heck can I somewhat relate to this whole internal conflict
WE CAN LIVE LIKE JACK AND SALLY IF WE WANT!! (blink-182 reference that took me way to long to place)
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH VIRGIL HELPS THOMAS OUT!!!! I'm so excited to see the development from here!!!!
VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS GLITTERY-
I love everything about this 😁
just realized.. Roman says he's old for being in his 30s. Roman ya dumb goofball
Man if I had those two screaming in head, I would lose my mind. Like oh my god I can't with these boys.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES OMG YES YES YES YES YES
Man i wish I could get the patron but i would have to ask my mom because I am a teen  and can't afford it myself btw love your  videos  Thomas
found out this came out through a U!patton tumblr account and almost had a stroke i was so excited
"I don't want me to be doing this either" really want to know if the john mulaney quote was intentional or not
this was so freakin cuuuute
I love how Virgil was panicking because he was scared that he made them disappointed   And that shows that Virgil does care for the others
haha Virgil's makeup keeps changing at the end
"Shut up emo"-Roman 2020 (19:56)
Is it just me or does Virgil have purple eyeshadow in some scenes of the end card?
YES IT IS FINALLY HERE A NEW SANDERASIDES
Ahhhhhhhh I love the purple eyeshadow on Virgil it’s like he’s blushing y’know I just love Virgil in general like ahhhhhhhh omg Virgil he’s literally my favorite sides Logan is my second Roman is my fourth but I can just leave my baby Patton left out to be a fourth fifth sixth etc, because I’m just gonna say it I love all of the including Thomas omg I’m freaking out and I can’t breathe omg breathe serene breathe… ok I’m ok
✨G a y✨ ✨P a n i c✨
Oh my god, that was so cute!! I'm so proud that animated Thomas did it!!!!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺 YAY
SO THOMAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART (ROMAN IS HIS HEART) IS HIM SAYING HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HES DOING AND WHATS GOING ON AND HOW CONFUSED HE IS, MY BABY BOY
23:13 me: HE HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW!!! THAT IS SO AMAZING IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE BLUSH!!!
I love watching sanders sides bc its like himbo the show+ Logan, bc logan is big brain
*YES*
ANOTHER ONE ITS A PERFECT DAY 😭😭😭😭
OH MY GOD    I LOVE IT 🥺
Is this Thomas's subtle way of saying he's found.......the one......hint, nudge, wink....cos that was soooo pure!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH........okay im done.
PRINXIETY 🥺🥺 IM GONNA CRY
Why is it that when they ran into the room screaming and I saw Virgil with the purple under the eyes and not the black (nice touch btw, I love the relation to his anxiety lessening with the lighter colors) I also screamed into my pillow 😂💖😂
Omg Virgil with the purple eye shadow!! I’m in love!
YES
4:40- 4:52 Omg virgil why did you have to call me out like this.🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😁🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 omg its true though
Every time I see anything relating to the episode I get back into a rush goshdANGIT-
did anyone notice that virgils eyeshadow changed color? everytime it was purple he was not being his usual self and being a little bit more relaxed and happy.
HAHAHAHAHA oh MY GOD! I cannot express how much I loved and needed this new video
BEAUTIFUL! BRAVO, BRAVO! 👏👏👏
not me considering starting up my business again to support thomas's patreon-
I think this was easily the most Prinxiety filled episode ever and I LOVED it. Im glad we got to see this fluffy and adorable side (hAH) of the series, especially after SvsS and just... Remus... Lmao ♥️💜💚💙💙💛
OH MY GOODNESS MAKE IT LIVE ACTION, MAKE IT LIVE ACTION, MAKE IT LIVE ACTION. THIS MAKES MY GAY SELF SO HAPPY 😆😆😁😁😁
I am a simple person        I see Sanders sides      I click       And still a faithful Virgil kinnie      Edit: this is the best episode ever I love it and can relate to last sene of Virgil and Roman it’s was beautiful  Heuuhquyhajygwjygywubwiuhkquhiubsujbwiqjiuwhugyw Please make more
In the final live action scenes, Virgil’s eyeshadow changes back and forth from purple to black
I kept yelling at my phone lmao i was so excited for thomas and the new episode
noooo Virgil's eyeshadow was all purple and glittery and then went back to black when Thomas asked if they were ready for a relationship :((
The whole trying to find out if a guy is gay thing just by looking at him is so accurate it hurts 😂😂
Virgil: stuttering and rambling  Roman: shut up emo Me: *internally screaming* omg prinxiety eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
why is nobody talking about Virgil's eye shadow? i cried for thirty minutes after a several happy stims (this comment was so hard to write because I was still stimming)
I love this so much This made me so happy I related so much and the artists style was so fun and unique 🖤  AND VIRGALS MAKEUP I LOVE IT
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
tHE SPARKLY EYESHADOW MADE ME SO HAPPY
I just revisited sander sides. I have a L o t to catch up on as I see.
"no Thomas, you can't use info you snooped for. That's like cyberstalking...but real life" "Soo... Stalking?" "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT!"
I'm crying right now I want more it was amazing
This made me genuinely happy. I love seeing these kinds of things. It brings a real smile to my face.
18:02 *gay panic*
Did anyone notice how virgils eyeshadow changed colors when he was excited vs worrying?
Pardon me but...what is Nico (did I spell that right?) Say at 16:21?
🎶I want to be a patron but I have no money 🎶
This video was definitely worth the wait! And it was absolutely fantastic! But also different, but I liked that it was different (see what I did there😏), once and yet again, excellent job to everyone involved with this video!👏🏻🙌🏻👌🏻👍🏻
WAIT DID THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEN
*Edit: I didn't read the comments beforehand, and so many people already commented about this. but I spent a solid 7 minutes writing it so I'm just gonna leave it here;  anyone notice Virgil's eyeshadow turned purple and sparkly whenever he was exited?  and every break in the excitement it went back to a matte black? think that's intentional? I mean, it could be an error between days recording,  but it could be intentional  because I can't remember ever seeing sparkly purple eyeshadow,  nor Virgil THAT excited.  comment if you think it's on purpose or coincidence.
Im watching this for the third time.....prinxiety confirmed?👀
^-^
Did anyone else notice that Virgil's makeup became more intense right at the end when Thomas said "Are we ready for this?" It could have just been shot at a different time than the previous clips...ooorrrrr...we have a stressed side
This is making me blush so hard this is so cuteeeee 😭💞❤️
Oh my gosh they are so adorable!
I really hope they are able to make this is real life once this how pandemic is over !!😁
Oh that was adorable
I loved the purple/silver eyeshadow combo on Virgil, it looked absolutely fantastic! (I also noticed that it got darker when he became more anxious)
Do you think the sides have like final forms or like the best possible version of themselves, and Virgil’s is that excited butterfly feeling in your stomach, which is why his eyeshadow was changing? Or do you think I’m overthinking this? 😅
I thought the first few episodes with Virgil was good this was amazing and hit way too close to home, but I loved every second of it
As an extrovert, this is so frustrating to watch 😂 IS IT THAT HARD FOR YOU GUYS? I AM SO SORRY HOLY CRAP. Guysssssss we love you
If I'm honest, Janus and Patton should be in this, also, I smiled the whole time, and im crying...
props to the artists for mastering thomas' comedy and making him, roman, and virgil so fricking adorable the whole time
i miss you so much
Does this mean that Thomas has a boyfriend?!
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW BEING PURPLE NOW
DGAHHSSGAGAGGS VIRGILS EYESHADDOW GOINGG SPARKLY PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY IM DYING ITS SO CUTE AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
VIRGE WITH THE PURPLE UNDER EYE IS SO FLIPPIN CUTE
VIRGILS HAPPY EYESHADOW !!! I’m in love !
I kept having fangirl shipping moments and I kept giggling like an idiot at the adorablness
social anxiety is definetly something that has built up over this year but enough of this HALLOWEEN IS HERE sorry sanders but i think its better than christmas on other notes  Roman: rela- Virgil: DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX mood
Roman: "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" Me, dramatically clutching my chest: MY GAY EMO HEART
22:35 O! Is dat?! AAAAAAA! VIRGIL GOT PURP EYE SHADOW!!
As a gay man I related to this video so much, I started crying I love this
Bro!!!!!! No joke me and my last boyfriend met doing what you called “Gay eyes” in Target! That was the most awkward situation but the funniest thing that’s ever happened to me 😂
9:01  V:‘No do look at yourself Thomas, cuz that was a test and you failed’  T:’ YoU wErE tEsTiNg Me?!’ V:’no I was just panicking’. Me: Same
The second hand embarrassment is strong in this one
"Exactly. no" I resonate with that on an emotional level
Alternative title: Prinxiety and Gay Panic for 24 minutes
Virgil having purple eyeshadow when he's extremely excited is the cutest thing ever
I feel like the next episode we have is going to be very angsty because Roman feels like he makes a lot of mistakes and Virgil still calls Janus Deceit
Is Virgil's eyeshadow switching between purple and black just gonna be a thing now Like I'm not complaining
So funny
NEW VID YAYYYYYYYYYYYYY
14:43 - 14:56 I am living for disgusted Roman
YES IM SO ESTÁTIC ABOUT THIS
Ah yes prinxiety hanging out together post Janus acceptance
Anyone els really want to see this act out when COVID is over because I’d kill to see actual Virgil and Roman Glances
.
I loved this so much especially how virgils eyeshadow changes colors
Okay so I just got my emotions back today and this made me both fan(questioning gender) and cry at the same time
I didn't think I'd enjoy a 20 minute long animatic this much, but dang this was amazing-
VIRGIL!!! AHH! He was so cute in this episode.
Cute
This video made me feel so gay-
"oh! *delete it*" ODDHSHT
Prinxiety!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAA
Did in see princiety at the end there
17:10 to 17:20 is the most wholesome part of the entire thing. Virgil was scared and panicked by everyone's sad mood so he just push Thomas. The artist for this did literally beautifully on this, making it fun to watch, and also making you finish watching with a happy smile. In my opinion the frame at 17:18 was also the most frame, with Virgil facing all fears and pushing Thomas while Thomas is just there getting wholesomely (<--- Not a real word) shoved by Virgil and Roman just watching it all go down.
YESSS I MISSED MY BOYSSSS
I love how Virgil and Roman literally provide Thomas with binoculars to see the stickers and still proceed to make him walk closer to the guy to get a look at the backpack buttons-
How do I know if I got the shirt
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow switching from purple and normal !?
Lil punk, lol. Also, Virgil telling Thomas to walk around the condo and to shake his hands for no reason is the best thing/most accurate thing Virgil, as anxiety, has done.  Haha.
I am sCREAMING
Omg this was so adorable ahahahhahahhahahaha
OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD    (also ABD helped on this!!! it's so cool!!!)
The wholesome gayness in that video was ✨ASTRONOMICAL ✨
I never related to anything more then when Virgil said “Thomas you gotta do something with your hands.. they’re just hanging there.”
I dont even watch Thomas sanders anymore I just come back for sanders sides 🧍‍♀️
ITS SO GAY! I HECKING LOVE IT!!! Honestly I didn't really get *get* the whole "could be gayer" thing, but now I totally do, it's just so nice to see gay representation in media I love. God why does that sound so fake to type though? I guess I've just been "straight" for so long, it's weird to be super into this new side of myself....wait god damn it, that was not an intentional pun I swear 😂  In any case thank you so much Thomas, for being so open about your sexuality. It's just really lovely, even if that seems weird to say 😅
Is no one going to talk about the "Janus' Patreon" thing MY SNEK BOY HAS A PATREON
I was stiming so much while watching this why does this make me happy!,
crying
AHHHHHHH THIS WAS SO CUTE AND ADORABLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH I LEGIT STARTED CRYIIINNGGGG AWWWWWW
Me: *actively deciding not to ship any of the sides together* Me: *watches this video* Me: ...prinxiety
The biggest reveal about this is that Roman has legs
I’m sure like no one will see this but I wanted to thank you Thomas. I’m going through a really tough spot in my life with school and my family and this video has made me the happiest I’ve been in weeks, so thank you and keep up the amazing work.
oH mI gOsH i LoVe It So MuCh!!!! i am shook, that was so cute. but i can relate so hard to the GaY pAnIkK
I LOVED THIS EPISODE!!!!
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing colour?
🥺🥺🥺
Prinxiety shippers are probably having a heart attack while watching this Also I freaking love how Virgil's eye shadow turns bright purple when he's happy 🥺 and how they were all fangirling, this is the happiest Virgil ever been
Virgil needs to keep the purple eye shadow!!! Oh!!! I love this so much!!!!!
YESSSS I LOVE SANDER SIDES! Edit:SHHHHIIIIIIPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!
YESSSSS, SANDER SIDES!!!! IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG!! LOVE YA THOMAS!
This is adorable and I want it now 🥺
EYy, Animators they have gotten so far! Well done bros!
This honestly got me so hooked, I couldn't stop watching
THOMAS YOU CANT KEEP GIVING ME PRINXIETY ATTACKS—
Oh that was amazing!! 🌈😎
You said love weirdly....Is this a hint to a new side???
Aw Prinxiety at the very end
This...is so cute. I adore this so much.
I love this it's so cute.
This makes me really wanna go talk to the crush I have that lives right next door to me- that I have been terrified to talk to- ;w;
OMG!!!! I LOVED THAT!!!!!!!
We need some Fs in the chat for bathroom dude.
I smell Prinxiety 👀👀
This makes me think about when i met my gf-
Roman: "Shut up emo"   Tumblr: SHIP FUEL 👀
I- god I'm too gay for this.
Roman I'mma tell Patton that you said hell!
I love th
I saw this on tumblr and thought this was fake!!
I hate when people pressure creators into making content. This was SO worth the wait AAA! I also was half expecting Virgil and Roman to kiss at the end but that's sounds kinda strange coming from my mouth wait why am I posting this-
"No i wasnt testing you. I was just panicking"   Cackling but also it hurts how accurate that is
Soooooo cute~~
AAAAAAAA
a year later :D
Virgil, what was that there at the end? Before the demon.
ABD!!!
Oh my god I feel so called out 😂 Also I kinda feel bad for that guy in the bathroom who thought Thomas liked him 👀
I LOVED THIS
Okay I just have to say Virgil gay panicking and being brave. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
Thomas you don’t understand how much this helps me. I hate talking, and usually make my friend talk to people for me. Just...thank you for doing this. This was exactly what I needed
This is amazing
Omg Virgil with bright purple eyeshadow when hes excited is such a cute a super cool detail!
The beginning made me........ I--     KANDNDMNDNDNDMDKEKKWKAKAJSKSTheyre  THOMAS BEING GAY RN!!!!!!! JANSJSJDJJDDJKDKDKDKDK I AM LITERALLY SHIPPING SO HARD
WTF this is so cute???????
I love this episode where Virgil made a brave step   Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek
Love to the bone amazing art style!! Can't wait for more content!! You are amazing!!! And LOVE the creativity!!
I need to figure out how to experience a video for the first time over and over again... Because I'm absolutely in love with this video + I'm always a sucker for Thomas and ABDIllustrates 😆💜 Amazing vid!
*screams* I love this- AHHHH
4:41 "Is he Gay, or European?"
Why did this make me wanna cry seeing them so happy it’s so wholesome I love it
I miss you!
Thomas Virgil and Roman fanboying  Me: *Fangirling inside* AAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!
MY DAY HAS BEEN MADE MERCI
I NEED A SANDERSIDES CARTOON NOW SO BAD!!!!
Omfg is he actually going to pursue Prinxiety?!?!?!  I mean I know he's not but I like that he hints at it😂
This episode came at the perfect time in my life. I've been struggling to ask out someone in my class, but end up having a breakdown at the thought of communicating with him. The part where Virgil pushed Thomas really hit me hard. Thank you so much for this.
"Idk, *plant* "
Anyone else notice the change in Virgil's makeup. Like omg the purple eyeshadow really suits him, then back to black. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
I was soooo excited to see a new episode of Sanders sides! I recently binged all of the Sanders sides vids but the last one was a while ago so I was afraid they were gone! I got inspired by the one where you were talking about people dressing up in the sides cosplay for Halloween so I have been sewing my own dragon witch costume for this year!!! Oh and btw my fav of all time is Virgil!
Not gonna lie when Virgil said “Will Deceit continue to be the solution to all your problems? Is that fair to him?” For a second I thought Virgil was talking about whether it be fair to Deceit. Like fair to put THAT much pressure on one side/person.
ahhh!!! i love this
Me: this is fine My brain: very fine
7:45 the thing says 96...thomas is that a refrence👁️👄👁️
19:51 🎵🎶🌈 One touch is all it takes falling in love with me🎵🎶🌈
Still waiting for prinxiety to be canon
THERES A DISNEY CARSTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love so much is so cute 😆😆😆😆😆😭😭😭😭😭💜💜💜💜❤️❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙💙🖤🖤🖤🖤
The purple! I saw it and thought "no I'm just seeing things" but the purple eyeshadow! I love it! Can we see virgil happy and excited more often?
Roman really said: ✨no think✨
Does logan have a dark side? Patton’s is deceit, roman’s is remus, and virgil’s is paranoia, but who’s is Logan’s!!!!!!!!
I HAVE NEVER SQUEALED SO MICH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HELP- LIKE I DONT THINK ILL BE ABLE TO TALK FOR A FEW DAYS FROM LOOSING MY VOICE-
THIS IS SO ADORABLE AAAAA LSDIBVEIFUBVWPFOIV
Is Patton talking in the bathroom sence
“I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay”  *I am qUaKiNg in my band tee-*
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
This is so cute my heart is about to EXPLODE AHHHHHG I CRIED!!!!:3
Ight what I wanna know is...      DID U GET THE DUDE OR NOT
Thomas: I've gotta stop whooing strangers in the bathroom Me: this has happened before?
I LOVE THIS ❤️ Keep up the AWESOME work
Virgil being extremely excited for once literally just saved my day from how ADORABLE IT IS.
I sensed a LOT of prinxiety in the end >=}
Sooooo cute! I love your videos, but being an animatic lover make my heart squeeze during all the video! I felt like I was the protagonist 💖 I cried and laughed at the same time. Thank you so much for such a beautiful memory ❤️🙇❤️ I hope you make more videos like this. 😬👍
I’m super smiley right now!!! YEEEEEE!! :D
Prinxiety shippers are screaming rn! (Exposing myself here)
Can someone tell me the unsafe reasons im confused
Dang I want to join the patrion but I have to save to up for college :( love that shirt tho
The episode TOTALLY worked with animation! I can't imagine it any other way, good job guys! 😊
I love your videos Thomas your videos are amazing and I loved when virgil's eyeshadow went from black to purple I hope that you will post more sander sides and with all sides virgil, patton, Logan, Roman, janus, and remus.
V`s eyes im in love
I may just decide to find the courage to just talk to my crush for once!
That was an EXPERIENCE and I’m lovin it
The way he said "shut up emo" at the end omg I'm gonna cry. Does anyone else remember how they where at the beginning of this series, and look at how they are now! God I love these two. <3
This episode made me so happy and smiley!! It really made a crappy day sooo much better 😋
I've been waiting for this
I freaking loved it! It was so cute! I had " Your Name " flash backs. I'm just like go talk to him you fool! Lol
I'm sorry Virgil but is that purple eyeshadow yeah I love it keep it going
I adore how Thomas stims at the end and I love that Vergil is the one who directs him to. It a little detail that is very fun to see. Self-stimulatory behaviours (or stimming) are usually connected to autism however it is a common thing for anyone to do to help ease anxiety. It’s just something fun I noticed that I can relate to (being autistic myself I stim a lot). It’s nice not only to see it, but to also normalise it for people who are nurotypical. I think that’s cool.
Now we gotta Wait another 3 months    And Is everyone gonna ignore   What happened to Roman and janus  Situation    Yeah okay
Virgil, Thomas, and Roman freaking out in the end warmed my heeart!
😂 I love virge and ro
Thomas be completely honest we all know you ship prinxiety literally the last scene is literally them secretly making the gay stare.
I want to be in your patreon but Thomas I'm also poor so ya
Y E S T H O M A S I L O V E Y O U and every artist involved in this video, of course! 😗✌✨💅❤💞🌈
So uh- black eyeshadow expresses disstress while the purple eyeshadow's eustress??
THIS WAS THE SWEETEST MOST CHARMING THING EVERRRRRR I WAS SMILING THE WHOLE TIME I LOVED IT SO MUCH AHHHHHH
i'm gonna make a pin  that says "certified pintrovert"
I think I've lost count of how many times I had to pause this and resume playing it because of the second-hand anxiety xD
Roman; I hate to rain on you black parade- Me: TO JOIN THE BLACK PARADE!!!!!!!!
Screamed when I saw this. LOVED IT!
So how does patrion work? Is it a monthly thing or a one time payment? I'd like to take part
OML this is AMAZING
Wait...if they're you does that mean that Virgil,Logan,and Roman are gay O_o
Bro having any type anxiety, SUUUCKS!! You make these these things funny. Thank you so much!!!!
...just saying this but how does nobody see the resemblance-sorry not resembalance but similarities between virgil and nico di'angelo?
ok i’m kinda small brain but people are talking about virgil’s eyeshadow a lot, like white, purple, sparkly, rainbow- can someone give me some time stamps?
one of the best episodes yet
I feel the feelings, I think they're all happy! Virgil with the purple for excitement, Roman finally getting to do what he wants, THE ANIMATIC! all of the excitement! I am so happy! Also, it's really fun to see Alex's work featured!
Virgil is both anxiety and excitement   Because the best feeling is when your really anxious about something then the thing you where anxious about turn out to be the best thing you have every done and I love that feeling a lot it was the reason I started doing more things outside of my comfort zone! So he is both!!
Ahhhh is all I can say about this video
THANK YOUUU AHHH
#PRINXITY
This one struck a chord. (Cried like twice) You are amazing Thomas. I will forever be in awe of your honestly, humour, passion and perspective. You make my worst days into my favourite days 💕💕💕 you got a Thomas sanders fan till the end right here!!
virgil exists  my anxiety: ight imma head out
MY VERY LIFE PURPOSE HAS BEEN FULFILLED!!!
16:08 *GAY PANIC*
Did anyone else realise that they were smiling like a weirdo by the end of this video??      Just me? Okay...
I was watching this with my friend, they had paused it i asked why and they said "they is giving me anxiety". i- just yes
💖💖💖
Well, roman and Virgil are really trying to help Thomas! And now Thomas has to believe in himself!
Nobody is gonna talk about the happy stim Virgil: I’m gonna need you to move your hands, they’re just hanging there Me: oh yes, happy stims have been put into words
I thought from seeing the clickbait it was the meme "gay or european?" 😂
I love this animatic, but I really want to see this acted out in real life! I do however want to say that it's important to stay safe, so do what you have to in order to protect ourselves!
EXCITED VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE EYESHADOW AHHHHHH GOD I MISSED MY B O Y
This is both painfully accurate and totally adorable. Love the animatic!
Boi... just the level of relatability with the social anxiety..👀👀
I feel like this video is just Thomas letting us know how excited he is to get a date
Soooo he took Virgil with so hot topic and other of those stores and Roman for the Disney store he just took prinxity to the mall
OMG VIRGIL IS STIMMING AND MAKING THOMAS STIM!!!!!! Today is a blessed day 😖😆
I was feeling really upset and seeing that you uploaded Thomas really cheered me up thank you. It made it even better that it’s prinxiety
I clicked so fast
VERY glad this was an animatic, could not have been able to handle the secondhand embarrassment otherwise
This is overthinking on level 392848281828
Virgil at the end when he hears the dog bark: ah! Demon!  Me: 😂😂😂😂😂 Roman: you do this 8 time a day, relax.  Virgil: don't tell me to relax!  Me: 😂😂😂
I would love to join the Patreon but I can’t 😭 but I do love the work you do I love all the Santa sides my most favourite is probably Janice and Remus just because we don’t see them often but all the other characters are also amazing  I love what you do and I love to see everyone and you grow thank you for always being there from the start I just wanted to...... say thank you ❤️
JACKSEPTICEYE REFERENCE YES
Omg i love this episode
this is the most cutest thing i have ever seen in my life so far!!!!
I just have to wonder if this actually happened lol
14,022 one here and late

Thomas, Roman and Virgil super excited at the end of the video is so cute ❤  Also, Virgil with purple eyeshadow when he gets excited is so cool
Yas Thomas! Get that boy!
There is so much princxiety in this 🥺
This is such a mood.
Was that Virgil's "darkside" voice when he yelled "ah demon"?
Great to see a new video

Amazing as always
OMG I JUST REALIZED THIS WAS POSTED SOOOO EXCITED AHHHHHH
THIS WAS SO AMAZING
5:19 AAHHHHHH BLINK-182 REFERENCES I GEEK
The ENTIRE episode I was like  yes  *nodding* so true yep I hate it when I do that *more nodding* yeah
I am making a petition to rename the Virgil x Roman ship to ✨Gay Panic✨
IM NOT SIMPING YOU ARE SHUT UP!!
I almost cried T^T it just reminded me how social anxiety bothers me so much that I can't talk to people I like or talk to people at all but I really liked how it ended even though it wasn't real it was still so freaking cute and adorable
I DIDNT HAVE WIFI WHEN THIS CAME OUT SO IM SO SAD ALFKSKAJFHEAJFJEHAHD I WANNA CRY OMG IM SO HAPPY THANK U FOR MAKING THIS I LOVE U THOMAS AND CREW YOU ARE SUCH AN INSPIRATION I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Was that a bit of Roman x Virgil at the end?
Virgils back
This was genuinely so amazing! The art was fantastic, the script was wonderful, and the fact that Thomas can pull off the Sides' distinct voices like that so we know exactly who is talking is an incredible display of talent. This really is one of the best episodes y'all have ever done! I love that in this format not only can the setting change but the sides can freely interact with one another too. Great job guys your hard work really shows and absolutely paid off!!  ❤💜
I can't wait for Christmas so I can sign up for the Patreon lol
AHDHAHZJFHS
Virgil and Roman were so gay for each other at the end
THE EYESHADOW I AM SO CONFUSED AND HAPPY
“I’d hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay” MY FAV SANDER SIDES QUOTE SO FAR!
BOTH THE ANIMATIC AND THE CLOSING STATEMENTS MADE ME TEAR UP
I ship Roman and Virgil, this video killed me Bruce it's both awesome AND has those two in it. They are just my favorite characters too
"I don't know plant"  Thomas Sanders 2020
The comments: IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT—  Also the comments: *talking about all of these things*
I’VE BEEN WAIT FOR THIS FOR MONTHS!!!!  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
Thomas stimming!!!!!! I was literally shaking my hands when he did and I just *hand flapping intensifies*
this so freakin cute! i wanted to cry because of how frickin sweet it was!! they've grown so munch, and seeing the sides made my day. ya'll did amazing on this!
Is no one gonna talk about that adorable Prinxiety moment at the end-
This whole episode I have literally squealed like R2D2 I can’t help it-
Roman: What are you doing?! Tomas: Uh...I-I don't know. plants...  I felt that. Felt that in my soul.
I love it so much
Thomas! That was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen! I’m so happy for you!
I friggin'- I want to scream, but like, a good scream. The first half was like,,, so friggin awkward and painful to watch because DAMMIT WHY IS IT SO RELATABLE- But THE ENDCARD. HOOOO BOY THE ENDCARD. I SAW THE PURPLE INSTEAD OF THE BLACK EYESHADOW ON VIRGIL. Like, is that a hint on something or is it just filming difficulties, but then it switches back and forth between black and purple and I- NNNNNNGGGGGEEHHHH Sorry, my brain is going in five different directions at once with this, but this is AMAZING!! GAH, I LOVE YOUR CONTENT SO MUCH
“DONTTELLMETORELAX!”
In the theme song, the cracked crown in the bg looks different
Soon as I finished the video, I joined the patreon. I'm so happy rn I could cry and simultaneously squee. Love this so so so much!!!! This is the inspiration I needed for my art 😍 so proud of Virgil, and really loving how close Virgil and Roman are, my ship ❤😭

fjfjjdjf I'm sorry but  when virgil said "what are gay eyes" roman just said "oh cute" ISTG THIS EPISODE IS FILLED WITH PRINXIETY MATERIAL UDUHDF
Not bad
"he fears things too?!" yes Virg a lot of people have anxiety
Love Virgil’s purple eyeshadow!! 💜
This is the first time we saw virgil squeel òwó so cute and rare  Edit:just noticed when virgil gets excited his eyeshadow turns purple
I love everything about this.
My two favourite outros are well your and SquareOneCosplay which is “ Remember to be there and be square.”
D'awwwww!!!! ❤🖤 I hope for Thomas that this (or something like this) really happened.  No wonder this took so long to make, it's fully animated. Wow.😲 Big thanks to Thomas and to all the amazing artists behind this!  Hell yeah I wanna see an irl version! 😆  I didn't know how much I needed this video. Thanks again.
Does they gay for eachother??????? Who knows
This is my favorite video now and it looks like a Prinxiety video that I love!!!!!!!!!!!💜❤ this video made my day I'm so happy
Thomas posted, AND theres a new chapter of Lore Olympus!
I want to know the background music to the YouTube people
Thomas....... I am begging you........ please please please please please please please please make Prinxiety canon!
This animatic is beautiful. ^w^
This one hit close. Im so scared of talking to a potenchal person..... that im considering settling? If that is the right way to say it. With an old friend who has had a crush on me for years.... but i just dont feel that way about.... all because i dont feel like i can get/deserve better.... i have that low self asteem and such big anxity over it.....
I like sanders sides
ok but why is this me
I'M GOING TO CRY!! I was hyperventilating at the end! That was soooooo cute!  Also, Princiety anyone??  So awesome to hear from you again Thomas, thank you for always being here for us and giving us better life lessons than school.
I scrolled down and saw this, would be lying if I said I didnt audibly scream
I happy stimmed so much and so hard I hurt my wrist. I've been so excited about this and I've had such a good week so this was just the icing on top of the cake!!!!! This episode was sooooo cute and so relatable. I hope one day you do like, the live action version. I loved seeing Roman and Virgil at the end being so excited and Virgil's purple eyeshadow!! It's so cute and it made me so happy to see this side of Virgil!!
5:18 me: huh  Two hours later  Me: WHERE ARE YOU!?!? AND IM SO SORRY!
Thomas, I first discovered you through your amazing Vines 4 years ago and I stayed because of your amazing personality. I don't usually post this sort of thing (you probably won't see it) but thank you for this content, it helped me a lot when I was coming out and recognising things I need to work on. You and your crew are some of my favourite creators, nay, favourite people in the world. It makes me so proud to be part of this community - I can't wait to see what you have next!
I love these so much they bring me so much joy
virgil's  e y e s h a d o w  being  p u r p l e  and s h i m m e r y  i'm not crying you are
Yowwww the "Shut up emo" sparks the Prinxiety ship for me!😍
Yay a new one These guys are so cute
Everybody: VIRGILS EYESHADOW  Me: THAT JANUS SHIRT DO BE LOOKIN SNAZZY DOE 😳😳
I like how towards the end of the animatic, it kinda hinted at the whole Prinxiety ship. Which by the way, I totally agree with
Virgil: *push* ... Roman: WHat are you doing?  Thomas: I dunno ✨ _p l a n t_ ✨
Isn’t this the guy who put the note about himself on the doordash?
14:20 I FREAKED OUT AND FELT SO AWKWARD
YES FINALLY ^-^
“Thomas imma need u to walk around the room, like, just walk around the *entire* room in a frenzy...” “Thomas do u hafta pee? I think u need to pee..” “Im gonna need to you to flap your hands. U gotta do something with them... like they’re just hanging there....”  “Are u sure u don’t need to pee?”   Anxiety/excitement MOOOOOOOOOOOD
Ok the fact that Virgil’s eye shadow is purple is so cute-  I might die of cuteness overload he’s my babyyyyyy
I-           ....im not crying someones just chopping onions (flashback to jadiens pokemon ruby nuzlock-
He was afraid you left had me wheeezing

This was SO good thomas SO good
Eeeee
the funny thing is, is that Gerard Way is pansexual- so Gerard Gay made me laugh
This is...this is really cute 🥺👉👈
IM HAVING A HEART ATTACK, PRINXIETY IS CANON
Me when Roman said cute guy:  6  3 6
roman and virgil plan things like dream vacations and also gossip at midnight
I DIDNT GET THE NOTIF FOR THIS OH MY GOSH!!!

remembering "you are my hero" and seeing we're back to happy Roman,  I love that. and I can't afford those items but I'll eventually get there. --- _why do I think that the jacket's design was placed so that the black crossed over the orange and not just cause it looks good there?_
"What are you doing?-" "I dunno...pLaNt"  God I love this LMAO
24:04 Virgil does the layered voice thingie again
AHhhhhh. I'm just very excited, it's the 1st time I've been around for a Sanders Sides posting, or any Thomas posting. Like, subscribed to Thomas, since I did that at some point after SvSR, I suppose, not born, I've been born for a while. But ahhhhhhh the eyeshadow! And the art! It's just so good!
We will always love our Tomas even

Amazing
*The question is,* who voices Niko? 😉
10:45 jeez all the foreshadowing of Roman’s self worth degrading over the past few episodes is really coming full circle
19:45, that was Gay Panic
Is no one going to talk about Thomas  swimming In the end card! It makes me so happy!
“he was AFRAID you left? HE FEARS THINGS TOO!!!” LMAO
I could FEEL the gay panic from here
I flippin felt that!!! 😳 When Roman touched virgil 🤩 I felt the RomanxVirgil ship coursing through my veins
I love this episode! And just, Virgil realizing that Thomas DESERVES happiness, and working up the courage to go and get it I love it man!
Roman having a gay panic  for 24 minutes and 13 seconds
AWWWWWWWWWWWW
Love is a key ingredient in all the best recipes... after salt  😂
How is everyone sleeping on gay eyes????
Ik all ppl care abt is Virgil's eyeshadow, but the way Roman said February....... cringe
Nico about to leave  Me: High Gear This Ish Right Now Thomas. Virgil pushes Thomas in Me:😀 I wish I had someone to say this to me
Me an Asian who needs ₽250 to become a patreon: ( T —T)👍🏽
Thomas, I’ll say this now. You’re amazing. You always keep me entertained and I can never stop laughing at what you do, all the way back to when you started with Vine. And still today these Sanders Sides videos teach me lessons in the funniest way possible. You will always be one of my favorite role models! 💗
Virgil was like the ship much sell  *Push Thomas *
I'm so proud of you, I cried so hard from relatability and happiness ;3;
BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL BRAVE BOY VIRGIL

Is that a Hogwarts castle sitting on the table behind Thomas??
19:32 that’s my favorite scene cause it’s so flipping ✨ *gay* ✨  Virge is blushing and princy is being ✨GAY✨  Also Thomas where can I get Virgil’s jacket?
10:45 fills me with joy beyond measure        “I dunno...plant”
OKAY THE PURPLE EYESHADOW THOUGH OH MY GOD THAT'S SO CUTE!!!!!!! I literally had to speed up the video in the middle because I was getting so stressed at the situation but didn't want to miss anything lol BUT OMG I LOVED THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I had money because I want that Janus shirt so baaaaaddddd!!!!!!!!!!
The mulaney reference thooo
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? *Idk pLaNt*  mood
Alright well see ya'll in another 6 months
Me: Oh cool, an animatic! *Sees the list of people who helped draw the dang thing* Me: ABDILLUSTRATES?!?!
OH MY GOD WHAT PLS MY GAY LITTLE HEART FLIRT TIME GAAAH
ok but did anyone else catch 8:02 ??????? once my brain caught up i was laughing so hard i couldn't breathe omg. virgil: "i'm like a triple expert! an ex-ex-expert!" roman: "easy tiger" me, 10 seconds later: .... ohH MY *GODDDDDD* /smacks the pause button
THE PRINCXIETY FANS ARE THRIVING TODAY
VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW 😍
this is perfection!!! omg all the emo references and Nico being the cutest ever aaahhhh i was so happy for that happy ending cute cute cute
I love the end where virgil's eyeshadow changed for whatever he was feeling, I think it could have been happiness? idk tell me what yall think the eyeshadow meant but I love the symbolism
I have been really depressed tonight and this really cheered me up. Thank you Thomas Sanders and Alex and the other artists.
Is he Gay, or European?
They didn't say be depressing when they said talk from the heart. TALK ABOUT JOHN MALCHOVITCH
i hate having the name Gerard because every time I heard Gerard I think of Gerard Way or me, and Gerard Gay is basically who I am because my name is Gerard....and I'm gay
Wait why was that cute lol
I’m just sitting here like “please be a true story, please be a true story!...” I really want to believe this happened and now Thomas is seeing nico cause that’s adorable
The pee part was amazing. I havent laughed this hard in days
Lil emo 🖤💜
"Shut up, emo." *Le GaSp* PRINXIETY!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! YAY!!!!!! OH MY STARS VIRGIL SAW HOW DISAPPOINTED ROMAN WAS AND HELPED HIM OUT BECAUSE OF HIS PANIC HE'D SCREWED UP!!!! AND HOW VIRGILS MAKEUP EYESHADOW KEEPS CHANGING BASED ON HIS EMOTIONS AT THE END CARD!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!♡♡♡
When you realize the 50$ and up patrons are sold out: 👁💧👄💧👁
The guy is SPORTY LOGANNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!
“I don kno... plant” ah what a great hufflepuff
Virgil: trys to be braveish Roman: BLUSH INTENSIFIES  later Roman: Bravery Virgil: GAY PANIC   (7:05 19:39) (19:50)      Prinxiety
Next video idea: Patton and Logan react to the latest sanders asides 😂 just... think about it 🙏
If only i had money for patreon :(
This seems like a thomas version of wing it like witches from the owl house
Roman: TELL HIM HIW CUTE HE IS! A REAL TEXTBOOK CUTIE PIE Virgil: YOU WILL *NOT* TELL HIM HES A “TEXTBOOK CUTIE PIE”
my eye hurts from smiling
The Disney castle in the background!!
Is this true because if it is i will scream!!!!!!! This was so cute and ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I WISH I COULD GET ITTTT, AAAAAAAAAAAAH-
Yes.
WHY DID MY COMMENT DELETEEEE. I was here 7 minutes earlyyyy
Omg I cant believe that it’s out
Got that ruff joke. Welcome back Thomas! The video was great!
thomas i love u so please tell me this is really
"So... let's not waste this one" is something from a romcom I love it
I'm pretty sure Prixiety ship also sailed at the end of this one lol!❤❤
Jamus is fianlly canon! Prinxiety is finally canon!!! This video was beautifully written thomas you inspire me. Thank you
Is it okay if I started crying for how much I saw myself in everything?
3:59 "You made me say them" that happens to me all the darn time its actually sad
When Roman pulls The Shoulder Touch on Virge- I love it
22:23    This is it, This is my favorite part of this video...       *Roman, Thomas, AND Virgil freaking out about how Thomas made friends with a cute boy and EVEN VIRGIL HAVING HIS EYESHADOW TURN PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY JUST—*  🥺 KAKAKAKSNNSJDHDHSHDBHDJAJDHFHDJSHJAJAJAKAAAAAA   23:26 Roman really said *NO THOUGHT HEAD EMPTY GANG :D*
Bro I just saw princey and virge and the words “gay or nay” and I clicked in the speed of *GAY*
THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE IT🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
23:34 I'm willing to bet Remus was in the toilet or something and Thomas seeing him just got out as quickly as possible, probably slammed the door while he at it XD
Awkward silence Thomas: you saw knock over that trash can didn't you? Nico: that was you!
And that's how Mr. Sanders and Mr. Sanders meet uwu
just loved, OMG an sanders sides animation was the best thing ever!!!!
When you *Really* wanna do the patreon but your broke:👁👄👁
Omg the prinxiety- my heart is so happy  Ok but the only reason virgil pushed Thomas to the dazzling man was because he saw Roman unhappy. And he had a panic attack over it. But he still did it. For him. For Thomas too. But mainly for Roman <3
This should be an animated series 👀
I feel bad for the guy in the stall
prinxety!! yas just the moment is soo cute.
Virgil has purple eyeshadow!!! Eeekkk!! 🤩😍😆 sooo cute!!
Alex being in this makes me sooo excited for him I swearrr
anyone else experiencing the sanders side effect where each sanders side video comes out EXCLUSIVELY when you're having a dilemma and the topic of the episode is EXACTLY what you're having trouble with
2, 4, 6, 8! Your no longer straight!
.....i legit cried at the end OK COME ON
I love this🧡 although my anxiety got the best of me and had to pause a few times XP
“You can live like jack and sally if you want”
am i the only one who at the end of the video when Roman and Virgil had that little moment I was fangirling like crazy because of the fanfics yea ok
The next time you talk about Disney princesses have Virgil bring up what really happened in the books please?
I WANT TO PLEDGE BUT CAN'T I WANNA CRY
"I dunno, plant?"
AHHHHHHH I RECOGNIZED ALEX ART AND I WAS SO EXCITED. GOD ID LOVE TO SEE A LIVE ACTION VERSION OF THIS BUT THE ANIMATIC WAS +++++++A. ALSO VIRGIL EYE SHADOW GOING PURPLE WHWN HES HAPPY AHHHHHHHH AMAZING WELL WORTH THE WAIT
Ahhh!!!! So cuteee!! Well done you guys! This was so good!
I LOVE THIS SM
OOOOHH MY LESBI HEART FELT THE GAY PANIC THROUGH THE SCREEN!!!  ( * W * )  I, myself, can see why people ship Roman and Virgil (so darn cute ngl...)!! Also, Virgil's eye shadow switching from the cute purple shade to black and so forth was HELLA adorable!   And just to add, it's kinda sad that both Roman and Virgil still call Janus "Deceit" instead of his actual name  ( . _ . )  Though, it does make sense due to their lack of trust towards him(Janus).. As well (and though Remus wasn't shown), it felt like Remus was the one giving out the awkward verbal impulses when talking to the workers (though Virgil was mainly the one affected by it due to the instant "sorry(/ies)" and constant rambling trying to explain himself).   Altogether, LOVED this episode/video <3 <3 <3   P.s. Would love to get that new Janus t-shirt if able to (it looks so hella cool!!)
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE END WHEN ROMAN AND VIRGIL HAD A MOMENT TOGETHER AND IT WAS THE CUTEST THING EVERRRRRRRJGJFJFJJFDJVJJCDJJFF
Dude happy but sad also    Virgil is a mood when he said "its like cyber stalking but in real life" And the Roman was like "so stalking?...." Virgie "Oh You're right!"
"Oh, um, yes I-I'll have the-uhhh Boiled Mayo Carrots." "OH GOD"
I swear this is what we call Gay Panic in a nutshell lol.
Okay quick possibly weird theory/question, but like I don't think that is completely Virgil in the end? Like it might be that his eyeshadow changes when he is excited but it also the lines when he had the purple eyeshadow seemed a bit weird. So is it possible that it is either a second half to Virgil or the missing seventh side? We all know that Janus came in pretending to be Patton and Remus knocked out Roman to take his place, so could it be that this is another side slipping into the conversation (my bet being on doubt or over-thinking because those both counter Logic) or is it that Virgil, being the most neutral of the sides, is showing off that he has a dark side (Paranoia) and light side (Adrenaline)?
I freaking loved this soooooo much it was funny but also heartfelt amazing
HE- HE SHIPS PRINXIETYYYYYY
I saw this and I was LIKE Y E S
AAAAAAAAA THIS IS SO CUTE IS IT TRUE OMG
I am still confused can you tell me why Virgil has light purple eyeshadow and then it goes back to black and it goes back and forth any predictions?
OMG YAY PRINCIEXTY IS COMING UP
Omg aaaaahhhhhh Prinxiety! @///@
Me- sees this on my recommendation- AHHHHHH I NEED TO WATCH THIS EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Patton and Roman -EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Virgil and Logan- eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee why are we doing this? CROFTERS
how,,,, how did virgil and princey get gayer,,,, big prinxiety moment
thats LITERALLY me when trying to ask someone out. *WOW I AM ONE S T R A N G E   KID.*
Iij haven't even watched it yet and I can tell this is based on Roman and Virgil
I’m only about 2 minutes in and I’m just asking but what about the people who can or just don’t want to be a patron like younger kids or just people?
Can we just- I-     The amount of times I fangirled in this episode- I can't-
:0 my last name is Flores
I’m a bit confused. Unfortunately, I’m unable to show my support on patron, but I love the Sander Sides message and overall story and don’t want to miss anything story wise. Will I miss anything that is mandatory for the story or anything foreshadowy? I would hate to not understand something because I wasn’t able to be a Patron.
Roman:"If I'm making a mistake,I will add it to tHE LIST-*le push" Me:...u okay there buddy may i see the list so i may burn it myself-
the prinxiety shippers are screaming right now
YOU GUYS SAW ROMAN'S HEARTS WHEN HE SAID SHUT UP EMO RIGHT? EEEEEEEH
THIS HURTS SO HARD OH MY GOD YES
I love the purple eyes
I love this
19:56 my shipppppp❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜
Oh my god Virgils makeup EEEEEKK
Rocking in my seat cuz OMFG
“Gay eyes”  Yep. Have done them, have received them, I’ll never see that girl again but oh my god was her smile pretty—
"i dunno,,,,,, plaNT"
I had to hear about this from tumblr,TikTok and discord cause YouTube wouldn’t show me😤
This is approximately 90% of my interactions. Romantic or otherwise.
I got too excited/second-hand embarrassed during this episode and flung my head back and hit it on my bed post and now my head hurts very badly -3-
The prinxiety fans are probably freaking out so much
THOMAS SHUT UP I CANT STOP SMILING 😭😭😭😭😭💜💜💜💜💜💜
Prinxiety moments: 3:32 the stacking is just too adorable 5:11 oh my god 5:31 no doofus and the face push 6:25 that whole bit 7:18 TEAMWORK also the push 8:14 gay eyes. Roman has definitely been giving virge gay eyes and he just hasn’t been catching on 10:09 Gerard gay 12:15 Roman called him virge 🥺 13:46 they make eye contact while Thomas is monologuing 16:09 *gay panic* 16:49 this frame 17:05 THE PUSH 🥺 19:33 SHUT UP TO *BRAVERY* AND THE SHOULDER PAT 20:12 the nail biting looking at Virgil’s spot 22:24 Roman talking about how Awsome the push was + the entire end card but specifically 23:30 AND F*CKIN 23:56 THAT LOOK VIRGIL HAS WHAT THE HELL                   Thank you for your time
Excuse me fellow Thomas...  I did not come on to Oprah Winfrey's internet to be attacked like this.... I do not approve this draw my life x_x
That animated bit was hard to watch af, yet it was still so C U T E ☺️😆 That daring moment Virgil made last second was magnificent! Overall, all I can think about is Virgils eyeshadow, I guess it’s modified by emotion now?
HOLY.... That was quite possibly one of my very favorite animations ever! If not my favorite... Plus it's gay! And it's also one of my dreams. I absolutely loved this and I can't wait to see if Thomas makes more of these. Thank you so much Thomas for all your videos.
Virgil pushing Thomas to talk to Nico when he saw that Thomas and Roman were upset was the greatest thing ever. It was so cute and brave. Omg, it was sooo cute!!! Also... PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!
Virgil is Nico di Angelo and Roman is Will Solace. (F.I.G.H.T. M.E.)         I hope you get the reference🙃
7:23 Virgil: you have have seconds max Roman: wh- I’m not max I’m Prince Roman
I've never clicked on a video so fast
HOLY CRAP I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EARLY
Anyone knows anything about the castle on the table in the background (not animated)?
G E R A R D G A Y
22:32 omigod they're like teenage girls at a slumber party, I love em so much
the paramore and mcr references are awesome. thanks thomas
Loved this so much!!!!
I FRICKING LOVE THIS IM GONNA DIE
The end card had to be the funniest end card of them all
holy heck did my gay little heart need this video today :)
I loved this sooooooooo much!!!!! It’s so cute oml!
*Essential for the story line* Oh god what’s gonna happen!
the normalization of stimming,,, the lil flappy hands,,, idk what im really saying but as someone who stims and has been made to feel bad and ashamed of it, it feels nice to see it in such a casual and happy way.
My second hand embarrassment really shot through the roof with this one. Watching Thomas awkwardly try NOT to communicate made me want to curl up in a ball and die. But it’s also so extremely relatable gay panick be real though. Great job as always!!!!
is no-one going to talk about that moment at the end?  Dog: *starts barking* Virgil: AAH, DEMON Thomas: THAT DANG DOG Roman: dude, it's okay. that happens thirty times a day. please, relax- Virgil, cutting him off: DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX
OH SHOOT I'M SO HAPPY FOR ALEX🥺
BGCMVFCYTLJ PRINXIETY OMGOMGOMG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM S C R E A M I N G RIGHT NOW!!! I SAW THOSE HEARTS AROUND ROMANS HEAD!!!
me: AHHHHHHHHH ITS HERE! the neigjbors: SHUT THE FUG UP!

VIRGILS EYE SHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE IS EXCITED AMSLFMAMDMGMGLH
The shushing is so relatable
Okay the animation was the most amazing thing props to the animators, and Virgil giving you a push was the best thing ever.
Why isn't anyone talking about this???  10:34 Virgil: You're making a mistake! Roman: If I am, I'll add it to the list!  Keeping what happened in POF in mind, that's some major Roman angst right there.
YAY LIVE ACTION SIDES
At 19:31 That was smooth as butter🤣🤯
Why are the tier names so hilarious lol 😂😂😂
I’m so Thomas and my friend Keaghan she is Virgil and my other friend is Roman
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS EPISODE!!! SO CUTE!!  (I also love Virgil's new eyeshadow!!)
What it's the guy in the animation show this video? What would he think?( God I sound like Virgil)
*i'm getting second hand anxiety from this*
Thomas x joan and princy x anxiety Shipppppp
This is litterally the 4th time I’ve watched this... AND IM GONNA DO IT AGAIN!    It’s now 2am...     It’s now 5 months later...
VIRGILS MAKEUP AAAAAAAAAHHH   that’s the comment
Ugh when I get money I'm going to pour it into his patreon. This is a necessary investment. This and merch. This is a goal of mine.
That was really cool i love it!!!!!!!
God all of Thomas's things hit so close to home including this. That feeling of utter unworthyness is something I have a lot... Thanks Thomas for making my life a bit better.
WAIT- This actually happened?-
JANUUUUUSSSSSSSSS
VIRGIL MY BABY BOY YOU DID A BRAVE
It's the voice crack for me 😂😂😂 THOMAAAASSSSS YAY
Some interesting quotes that just spark my nasty sense of humor: Virgil: "Pins?" Roman: "pins and needles? I'm on them too..." ... *96 on the table.....almost nice* ... Virgil: "...BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ANTI-SOCIAL ETIQUETE... I'M A XXXPERT" Roman: "easy, tiger" ... Virgil: "Thomas! do you need to pee? i think you need to pee" Thomas: Ok! *goes to the bathroom and comes back* I DID NOT NEED TO PEE Virgil: Virgil: aRe yOu sUrE yOu dON't nEeD tOo pEe? (I really hope i'm wrong and this is not a boner joke) ....  vIRGIL: you need to do something with your hands, they're just hanging there omg …. Bonus: Virgil: "...we put the ball on his court" Roman: "UHG YOU'RE KILLING ME VIRGIL" (y'know what? me too roman)   i absolutely love this video
AHH THE PRINXIETY MOMENT AT THE END I CANT EVEN! AND DID YOU SEE THE LITTLE HEARTS THAT FORMED NEXT TO ROMANS FACE WHEN HE PUT HIS HAND ON VIRGILS SHOLDER!!! I AM DECEASED!
MY HEART- IT CRUMBLES-
15:47 Janus just sitting crosslegged on the couch "hes right but also mean?"
This is even more funny if u have social anxiety/ S.A.D.
I cannot believe how good that was, also, i actually felt anxious for you, but i would have done the exact same thing
I cried at the Prinxiety bit at the end of the animatic, it was so beautiful
Oh my god I talk through my pins and stickers all the time 😅
idk what to comment but I absolutely love this
This is me-
Oh Virgil, sweetie! 😍😍😍😍 It was so great to see him again after his absence in the last episode. Hopefully this episode will be live action someday, but kudos to you and the crew for managing to create content safely during these times. Keep it up!
I need more buttons.
Video starts at: 2:24 That’s all! I really enjoyed this episode, gosh. I applaud these artists
my favorite youtube artist (alex) and thomas working together is just yesss EDIT: aLSO THIS SO FREAKING CUTE AND GREAT AND I LOVE IT
Nico: yeah..I was trying to write a song... Me: THOMAS SINGS FORM A BAND Thomas: I like...songs... Me: *happy squeals*
Hello I have just watched this twice in a row  the moments I absolutely love are too many to list
The secondary embarrassment aaaaugh I want to watch this cause yes is a good thing to learn how to handle but aaaaaaah
I love how Patton was never in any of the conversations love that a lot
Is Nico a real dude or just a character?
I wanna boop animated thomas
Prinxiety fans at 19:40: it’s happening it’s happening everybody stay calm...STAY F*CKING CALM But honestly this is the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen in my life, the drawings were amazing(so cute and beautiful) and the whole way Roman and Virgil have grown is amazing, THIS WHOLE EPISODE IS AMAZING
10:45
BROOOOOO VIRGILS PURPLE HAPPY EYESHADOW WAS THE CUTEST THING EVER
I WANT THAT SHIRT! eeeeeeee! I'm fangirling to much. QwQ
This is giving me steven universe vibes and I don't know how to contain my happiness
hhh so I spent money (very well spent) on the 12$ one- YOUR SO PRECIOUS I CANT- AAAAAA
Honestly I want Virgil an roman to be together
That bathroom monologue made me feel feelings
I love this episode!!!!! I also love ABD Illustrates inclusion in this! Alex loves sander sides and I’m so happy with the results! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
YAY VIRGIL!!!!!
Basically romans UwU face is just funny to me
I was screaming internally this whole episode Thank you so much
“You don’t know that his not gay”  My life in 7 words
So is no one going to mention that Virgil’s eyeshadow changes depending on how anxious Thomas is?
Has anyone else notice that Virgil has GLITTER UNDER HIS EYES?!
I really like the shift in eye makeup for Virgil when he shifts between positive/negative anxiety (... if that's even a thing).
WAIT doesn't he despise carrots??? Why did he go to a carrot shop??? Lol
Why did i think this was gonna be an episode about Thomas flirting with Virgil
I related SO HARD to Virgil in the end of this video
VIRGILS EYESHADOW GOT LIGHTER!!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
“Are we ready for this” bruh I had a crisis like this a week ago that hit WAY too close to home. I’m super excited to see where this goes from here!!
they really gave us ALL the prinxiety content huh
NOT THE GUY IN THE BATHROOM OH MY GOSH
No one:   No one at all:   Not a single soul:   Virgil: *gay panic*
*devours the video with excitement*
Virgill: you did it again Thomas: yeah I really need to stop wooing people in bathrooms
YES FINALLY ANOTHER ONE
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT WAS ONE OF THE CUTEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!! VIRGIL!!!! AND ROMAN!!!!!! ANS THOMAS!!!!!!!!! I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE!!!!!!!??? 💖
today marks the day that all non prinxiety shippers die inside as they watch prinxiety come to life. congrats to you prinxiety shippers tho this ep was very cute and good fuel for your flame
👀👀👀🥺🥺
This whole video is me
When I tell you I nearly cried- I MEAN IT!
Me: just woke up cuz I live in Asia and just got in on insta My friend who (maybe) stayed up all night who already watched it  : *PRINCIETY IS REAL-*
I've been waiting all day to watch this, and I couldn't stop fangirling by the end. I can't calm myself down. Help!
I LOVE THIS
Roman and Virgil working together to torment Thomas makes my annoying shipper self SCREECH
this was so amazing broh. props to everyone you all did the best!
My heart at the end  THAT WAS SO CUTE
JOAN
This is logit me lmao.
This whole thing was too heckin cute
OMG VIRGIL IS SOOOOOOO CUTEEE AND HIS EYE SHADOW IS EVERYTHINK I COULD EVER DREAM
OMG, Virgil gets a purple shimmer under his eyes when he's excited!
Ok I would date that guy.  I will ignore the malcovich
Just imagine if he was talking to himself in public. That would be so funny. I’ve actually done it myself and all you get is strange looks. Nothing serious 😁
DEFINITELY need to see Thomas gay eyes irl
Is this based on true events because if it is that’s adorable and I’m happy for you and if it’s not I am so sorry
AWW THOMATHY GOT SOME ROMANCE
OH MY GOD!! Prinxiety!!💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️
I just hope bathroom guy gets the love he deserves.
I didnt get notified! Still glad I am finally to se this ;w;
Me, who would join the patreon but is broke af so just watches from the sidelines:  👁👄👁
So what are they gunna tell Patton? Is patton ready for love again?   This video was amazing, I love the eyeshadow at the end very nice. Also the attention to all the convos that go on in your head whilst forgetting your phsyical  body is very much still seen by everyone is totally a mood. I was surprised when roman said speak from the heart that Patton didn't pop up. However I believe Roman was referring to Patton when he said 'if he's ready we're ready'. And I think Virgil freaked out a little because he realised that they hadn't even considered asking Patton if he's ready or that Virgil believes Patton isn't ready and we're about to see an angry or upset Patton.
5:17 BLINK 182 REFERENCE AHHH
"Do you listen to boy in blue?" I'd the best thing to zY in these situations
Roman: * explaining the gay eye * It's sort of like Roman: *Gives Virgil the Gay Eye* Edit: Someone asked for a timestamp so 8:25
Omg I hope this is a real event because that’s so adorable!! Also I can feel the struggle through the intire video
Yasssssssssssss i love this also, I have social anxiety too I know how you feel.
The pacing and hand flapping especially at the end made me super happy to see anxiety specifically asking for, as someone that does those things when I'm super excited/stressed/anxious myself!!! It just puts a big smile on my face, it's really nice to see it :)
"You don't know if (s)he's not gay." Me telling myself that when I see my friend who says she straight
Why are "gay eyes" a real thing hahah. The amount of guys I've met that way is funny
(are we not gonna note that Virgil was quite literally on the verge of a panic attack when he pushed Thomas toward Nico but he did it for Roman's sake anyways I think he was very very courageous during that)
YAY
Hi Thomas, soooo you probably won’t see this, but I’m a writer, and having the opportunity to read your scripts (which are amazing) or to participate in writing them is an incredible opportunity ☺️
AAA YAY
I absolutely loved this video, i feel like i begin to learn more about myself and love and accept myself after watching each and every sanders sides episode
10:36 Roman had the chance to quote No good deed but he didn't, that's how you know something's really wrong
VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW OMG I LOVE IT he has it when he’s excited, that’s so awesome and such a cute detail!
Thomas having a boyfriend or future boyfriend confirmed???????????? 🤭🤭🤭
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW????? ITS SO BEAUTIFUL I HAVE BEEN BLESSED
ASHAHDKSHBENF
I’m in love! The only confusion I had was if it was real or just a cute fantasy?   Because Thomas TOTALLY deserves a boyfriend right now!!!!!! (Plus this video cannons Prinxiety!!!!! *eeeeeehhhhhhhh*
THIS GOT ME SCREAMING ON A PILLOW OALXKDMLSCLLSPFJDJWJSJGJNFBFBEJEJEIFODOSPSPOS
I really liked this animatic and kinda want more... not to say I don’t love the regular videos but this was so cute and different.
Here come the prinxiety shippers
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was so cute I'm crying
No one is talking about the end when Virgil's eyeshadow keeps changing. Starting out with a purple and then to his usual black!
this video mad me so HAPPY 🥺
IM SO HAPPY WE GOT TO SEE VIRGIL IN THIS EPISODE IT'S BEEN TOO LONG AND WHEN ROMAN SAID HE WAS BRAVE VIRGIL STARTED BLUSHING EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO CRY
17:18  SMOL BABEY SMOL BABEY-
I love those despite the fact that I shouldn't. Plz animate with cg
Awe their symbols on the microphones
Watching this for the second time today cause is so gewd and missed Thomas and pals.
That video was too freaking cute I just finished it and I’m having a breakdown and crying because I was so worried for Thomas and it was so so cute I loved it and I’m watching this video over and over again I’m still crying it was too cute
When thomas walked away from the Food Court my heart was like noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I’ve literally watched this 3 times already and I plan on watching it so many more
MY SHIPPER HEART!!! There is something about animation that lends so much whimsy to this. I absolutely LOVED this animatic.
Why is no one talking about the sparkling eyeshadow
I am officially a pintroverts guys
🤣 "rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay"!?!?! 🤣  I wasn't ready and now I can't stop laughing!
That was awesome for Thomas Sanders I love it I watch that video but it's really good people for you
Mate this was just 22 minutes of gay panic and I'm living for it  Also Virgils eyeshadow turns purple when he's excited 🥺🤧🥺🥺🥺 that's ADORABLE hdhdhdjsjfhhd💘💘💘
Wait Thomas saying”top of a morning to you” me:top of a morning coffee
Thomas, I’ve been feeling super down recently. Things have been tough with school and friends, and watching this made me feel so much better. You make me feel better. Thank you for doing what you do! You da bomb
You know that phrase "you need to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else" ? Yeah I think that's what's gonna happen here. Whether it's possibly the sides facing their feelings for eachother (specifically roman and virgil) if there even is any. Or just thomas learning to love himself. That end card solidified my theory. God I loved this so much
Ahhhhhh I LOVE ITTTTTT
I do be loving this sander aside 😂❤️✌️it’s adorable
"I don't know - plant" MEEEEEEEEEE XD XD
SHINY PURPLE VIRGIL HE BABEYYYY IM GONNA CRY
God the second hand embarrassment from this episode was just spooky
This👏is👏so👏wholesome
is NOBODY going to talk about the BATHROOM GUY
Their is going to be a video posted in February
ok but there is so many references in this video and i love every single one of them
We were like " Omg it's gonna be so sad and angsty"  Reality: them literally squealing and fangirling about a guy/ being the happiest they've been In a while
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" Roman sounds like my positive yet sarcastic friends getting mad at me for being my emo self
Yooo Roman  Legit just did the shoulder touch
Ahhh goshhh I LOVED THISSSS!! Of course I love your live action content, and this animatic episode was SO EXTRA AMAZING! It's like seeing a fan animatic of a show you love and feeling super excited and wishing it was real, but this was ACTUALLY REAL!!!! Great job everyone who worked on this, I adored thissssss!!! (It made me squeal with how cute it is!)
This episode was so goooood!!!!!! I’m so happy to see my good old worry wart again, it has been so long. After Putting Others First, I’m glad Roman got some love!!! It was just so good to watch an episode based around Roman and Virgil, I feel like that hasn’t happened in a while. I loved the animatics, it was so good, I loved it. My heart was just exploding at the end when they were all so happy!!! I don’t think I’ve ever seen Virgil THAT happy!!!! I really loved his purple eyeshadow, that was certainly new! I want to see more of it!!!! This episode was just so awesome!!!! Definitely worth the wait!!!! I can’t wait for the next episode!!!!
Did anyone else notice the color under Virgil's eyes change at the end?
Wait at the end where they blushing at the end, Roman and Virgil.
Yay, new sanders sides!!!! and more of  our bean bby tomas!
This is different I like it
Anxiety's glitter happy eyeshadow thing 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
“Top of the mornin to ya!” Me: hdhvjhvgvhbhHjbbugHhbhfGftghJb
purple eyeshadow virgil..... hrfmgmrm....
I love virgils new lighy eyeshadow
Guess who thought this episode was a filler prinxiety episode when I first saw it-
That was adorable oh my god
I NEED MORE VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! AND MOOD CHANGING EYESHADOW-wait, what if the others had mood color changing aspects? Roman-sash Patton-cardigan Logan-tie Virgil-eyeshadow Janus-gloves/hat/eye color Remus-mustache  Just think how cool that would be!!
Thomas you are so awesome. I was honestly so worried when you didn’t post in three months. I am glad you are okay
"You're making a mistake" "If I'm making one, I'll add it to the list" Guess who has a new motto
... is no one gonna talk about Virgils outburst at the very end there- and then the fact that his eyeshadow changed to black again?
Why do I think prinxiety is becoming more of a thing-
iS IT PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY AJFJKc
Virgil’s makeup changes when he’s happy!!! OMG!!!
I wonder if Virgil and Roman are going to team up to argue against Janus and Patton
I kinda wanted Roman to have like a Nico's creativity popping up and just watching them fall in love 😂🥺
Aaaaaaa Prinxiety!!
Virgil got me crying 😭😭😭😭 and the constant switch between purple and black eyeshadow oh my God yes!!!!!!!!!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE
Virgil got new makeup ◡̈⋆ⓎⒶⓎ! (*´∇`)ﾉ it is more light then before
Oh my gosh! When Virgil is excited, his eye shadow turns purple and sparkly! That's so precious <3
SS Fans: Prinxiety  Literally Thomas: *"Hippity hoppity your ship is now my property"*
Well, Roman sure was flirting with social anxiety 🙃
What. Has Virgil been promoted from Anxiety to bravery. Or is that just Instagram talkin?????
so. freaking. cUTE!! MY HEARTTTTTTTTTTT
“A relationship doesn’t depend on how long you’ve been together, but the amount of trust you put into it.” I heard that somewhere.		so many gay thoughts, i love it. 			and the EYESHADOW, glitteeeeeeeeerrrrr		this was once again, an amazing video
THIS! AHHHHH! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT GERARD GAY
the ending was so cute when Thomas finally got to the guy, I was like yay! finally
Thomas' thought process with this entire thing is the most astonishingly relatable sh*t i've had a taste of this week ilysm thomas!!!!!!!
PURPLE RACCOON
OH MY GOD I LOVE IT
"What are you doing?" Uh...I-I don't know plant."  Same Thomas, Same
No one gonna talk about the Virgil x Roman moment here?      I guess I will.
THIS EPISODE  YES
"I dunno.... plan t"
PRINXIETY AND THOMAS TALKING TO A CUTE GUY?! YESS
Ladies and gentlemen this is the moment we all waited for, NEW EPISODE
Bravery is just the fear of losing something, so it makes since that Roman and Virgil are so closely intertwined
Me freaking out cause the bags under Virgil’s eyes were purple 😆😆😆💜💜💜💜 Wait so does that mean when he is happy they go purple 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Virgel eyeshadow turns purple when he is happy ... 22:35 this moment is precious
I'm so excited skdjfj
*pintroverts* I died
My Prinxiety heart was literally SCREAMING this whole episode
I gasped so hard when I saw Abd illustrates uwu
ID TOTALLY WATCH A CARTOON SANDERS SIDES
Roman to Virge: "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" Me: * squeals of happy emo *  edit: why is this getting so many likes I don't deserve them
*Me, person who actually works in a movie theatre* Me: Ok, 1: The door person isn't going to care 2: Even if they did say something, nobody's going to get in trouble because 3: The theater doesn't really make any money off of ticket says, they make it off their hiked up concession prices, so even if you feel guilty just get a small popcorn and drink, maybe even get something that doesn't have caffeine in it or without sugar if possible, and you not only have a snack for your movie you also contributed far more to the theater than the small discount you got for a senior's ticket.
I saw this on recommend and I nearly broke my phone out of excitement! EEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Nico: There you are! I was afraid you left! Virgil: WHAT?! HE FEARS THINGS TOO?!  Virgil I love you so much.
Well i just died like 5 times watching this. BUT not in a bad way.
Thomas I really liked this animation. I have an IDEA for you. You could write a book or a comic with storyline about you and your sides going on an adventure.
Don't know if anyone else noticed this but there was new Virgil development at the end there, here's a clue, his eyeshadow.  If I had to guess, I would assume that it gets brighter like that when he is feeling good almost giddy about something, where as it gets darker when he feels more anxious, which is proven.
Man these videos really have me crying, huh... Seriously it could be a fun and light-hearted episode but I'll be tearing up. Whatever the reason might be, I love these and they bring so much joy into my life. They've also really helped me to cope with life. Thank you Thomas and everyone else behind these videos💞
Be honest, how many times did you squeal
Ahhh I love sander sides
this was adorable ☺ I want it in a movie
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
Alternate Title: Emo and Prince actually get along with each other for once
I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS EPISODE AND THEY'RE ALL POSITIVE
I'm not crying you are....
"I donno, plant."
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M-
My birthday is tomorrow this was like a birthday present for me
Virgil is me through this whole video lol
OH YES OH MY GOD. Its beautiful I feel this episode was actually improved by the animatic thing becase it allows for more slapstick style humor (the trash can bit) and I've always wanted an episode of sander sides where they got out of the house. Oh I wish I could support you on patron but I jist cant afford it
I like how Virgil's eyeshadow changes from bad anxiousness - Black to "happy" anxiousness - Purple. A good lil touch there =]
Why is this me but bisexual xD
OMGGGGGGG! I loved this! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
YES.
K but the eyeshadow changing from dark to glittery purple based on Virge’s emotions is such a cool detail💜✨
“I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay,” I’m using that one
Omg your awesome. Your my idol . It would be awesome to get a reply from you. You vids help me with my anxiety and have been a big help. With that being said Virgil is my fav. But my life would be nothing without the snake boi in it. I know you probably won’t reply. But a girl can wish 💜💜💜💜💜💜
I’m in love with Virgil’s eyeshadow omg 😆 OMG
This episode was amazing! So painfully relatable, but also adorable! I’ve definitely done the pin/sticker scope before, but I never actually took the step of actually telling the person I thought they were cute! This gives me hope! ☺️  Also I LOVE the eyeshadow detail! It means that Virgil isn’t just fear, or fight/flight/freeze. He’s also that nervous but happy anxious feeling when something amazing happens and you’re just filled with adrenaline and feel like you want to flail and dance and take on the world!   Virgil’s eyeshadow is iridescent purple when Thomas is feeling so incandescently happy and excited about something!!!  It makes me so happy!!!! 😄💜💜💜💜💜  ( you can tell the difference because his eyeshadow briefly goes back to black when he tells Thomas to delete the vague post. lol 😆)
By the Gods, the start of the episode has the feels, but the animators did so amazingly! Can not wait till to see this recreated
Thank you for this Thomas! I was having a rough day, but seeing this and connecting to it so much really helped me feel better!
Is no one gonna talk about wat Thomas said at the beginning of the video-
Oh my gosh Virgil's eyeshadow is purple when he's happy awwww
That was beautiful this vid made me cry
Does virgil's eye shadow colour change if he's like R e a l l y happy?
I recently discovered that I'm asexual. I was extremely worried with how my life was gonna play out. This video helped me calm down. Thanks.
HAPPY VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW
OH MY GOD! I loved this so much, this is literally my life, trying to tell if a person could be bi or gay or not
Did anyone notice how much Thomas lied in this? Any coincidence that the sides calling him out on this are the ones that have been hurt by Deceit?
I SHIP IT!!!!!!!! BOTH OF THEM!!!! 💜❤💜❤
Okay but Virgil being blissfully unaware of everything that went down last episode. It HURTS ME. Because we joke about what Virgil and Remus were doing during that, but it’s clear Virgil was working on his mental health. Enough for him to be SO HAPPY in the end card. And it just hurts because he’s doing so well and I just KNOW it’s ALL going to come crashing down when he finds out about everything. I’M H U R T
OMG, I fucking love it
I'm 14 minutes in and I have been dying this entire time aaaaa-
brb sobbing
I LOVE this format
Virgil's ENTIRE thing at the end. 'I gonna need you to walk around the room' 'Do you need to pee? You need to pee' 'I'm gonna need you to shake your hands' my son is back and he's just as me as ever.
I'm pretty sure prinxiety is canon-
okay but can we talk about how the circles under virgil's eyes fluctuate from second to second depending on how stressed he is
this is amazing when i saw you put out a new vid i went to watch it also this seems very prinxitey to me you and the people that helped are amazing
Two things   1. Loved Virgil’s eyeshadow 💜🖤💜🖤   2. PRINXEITY!💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜
This is amazing- it's so good and   *✨p r i n x e i t y✨*
I. LOVE. THIS. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
BLATANTLY STEALING NOW GRANDPA
I'm so happy right now!😍🙉😁
hold up, does virgil's darkened eyelids light up when he's happy!?!?
Ok, first off yes please for the live recreation! Second, VIRGIL'S EYE MAKEUP TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE GETS EXCITED! SO CUTE! Third, this is going to hard core reawaken the Prinxiety shippers and I'm here for it.
I have a date with a really cute girl and I’m panicking
VIRGIL'S CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WE LOVE TO SEE IT
This is awesome
I didn’t know how much I needed to hear this right now, thank you so much for all the things you do!
If Virgil starts having colored eyeshadow my own Anxiety OC will have problems...
I just noticed that Virgil's eyeshadow changes between purple and black. It's a nice touch.
This is the cutest thing ever
Woah Roman called Virgil VIRGIL!!!
I...chills. that ending gave me chills
"i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay"
Purple eyeshadow???
through the entire "speaking from the heart" scene I was near tears, and then 14:19 hit me like a truck
10:36 is no one going to talk this? Especially after what happened in the last episode? Just me? Okay.
This series also wrecks my brain, and I’m not sure if it’s cause of all the work and effort and thought that goes into everything, or all the different theories that make complete sense, or like both of them working together. Like I feel like I will never fully understand everything that goes into this, and how everything is connected. Maybe it’ll be clearer after the series is finished, but like it’s a lot of connecting and stuff. Good job Thomas and everyone else who works so hard on this!! 👏👏👏
Omg I cannot stop watching the ending scene Where Roman Says  Roman: *💕* Shut up emo
I’m surprised deceit didn’t make an actual experience with all the lieing
Virgil’s eyeshadow WHAT THE HECK
I felt that in my soul when he didn't hear what he said
14:31 well he did not lie, he was saying his lines for this episode
This gave me so much actual anxiety 😂
"What are you doing?" "I unno... plant?"
Did anyone see the purple eyeshadow like😱😱😱
WHO NOTICED VIRGILS EYESHADOW WAS PURPLE AND NOT BLACK
If i saw a girl or an enby in public and tried to figure if they were gay i would faint from having an anxiety overdose
Love this😍😍😍
The eye shadow is changing colors O.O
Me in the corner: *spits out coffee* VIRGILS EYE SHADOW CHANGED COLOR?!?! Everything about this episode was awesome and I loved it ❤️❤️❤️ you guys are awesome
OMG I LOVE THIS EPISODE-
"i don't know... plant?"
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THAT WAS SO CUTE
We all know what you thought when you read the title PRINXIETY SHIPPERS. We know.
RIP to the thousands of fanders who passed after gasping too hard at Virgil’s new eyeshadow. Edit: oh my god I juts realised it changes depending on what he’s doing. Screeching with excitement: white and purple “Huh. Delete it.”: old black and slightly purple Edit 2: thanks for the comment about his emotions reflecting it, that’s kinda what I meant but my wording skills are about -3 so you know
I need a job s o on.
I slightly freaked when they said Nico. "Hee hoo thats me" was my exact phrase as i jumped happily.
im sorry but the prinxiety moment with the thomas/nico ship paralleled in the background? that CAN'T be a coincidence.
I have never shouted yes so loudly in my whole life!!!
This hit so close to home you don’t even understand 😭 except it didn’t workout for me 😅😓 kinda why I spent the last 2 days sleeping and not talking to anyone 😂 but I’m happy to realize that I had courage☺️ I didn’t think I had that anymore 🙈 I think you’re the only YouTuber that I’d pledge to tbh but what I can when I can🙊 btw I got so emotionally invested in this video🙈🤍
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW CHANGING FROM PURPLE TO BLACK Y’ALL IM SOBBING
THAT WAS SO CUTE WTF AHSNSNXMSKDMM
Hai danders  :3                          I really don't what to say
Oh God, he's worse at walking up to people then me(and thats saying some because my parents are normal the ones that force to walk up to someone)
I'm gonna be honest, I misunderstood the title and thought Roman was flirting with Virgil 😂
We need more representation like this I love Thomas Sanders so damn much oh my god I’ve never smiled so much
I squealed when I heard it was “Janus’s Patreon”- Amazing Episode-
My heart 💓
Right first amazing!!! Second virgils eyeshadow getting all glittery when he’s happy is my fav thing like ever  Third the animation is amazing  And fourth THE EYE GLANCES BETWEEN VIRGIL AND ROMAN TO EACH OTHER WHEN THOMAS WAS DOING HIS SPEECH AS WELL AS THE “shut up emo” UGH THOMAS GIVING US THE PRINXIETY CONTENT WE NEED AFTER US NOT SEEING VIRGIL FOR LIKE A YWAR
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!!
The king has gifted us with a video, viewers are delighted
Cryyyyyying
“I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay” will be my senior quote  Also I didn’t know you liked Paramore, awesome!
How come no one is talking about how Virgil's eye shadow goes from purple to black depending on how anxious/happy he is feeling???? Like what??? That is the best thing ever????
Virgil: "GAH! DEMON!" That was so cute.
NOT ME CRYING WHEN ROMAN CALLED VIRGIL BRAVE
6:50 no ones points out the reference smh guys 😔
roman: a disney fan?? i can feel the love tonight.   virgil: p-paramore?!?
Oh my gosh virgils eyeshadow is purple when he’s excited and black when he’s more anxious, my heart
Who else thought that Roman and virgil were gonna kiss
and pls don't ship Roman and Virgil
Shut up, Emo. (Aka my friends talking to me at any given time)
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY! I love this...I love Roman, and Virgil...Virgil my favourite :3  So relatable
MY HEART- OMG THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SO SO ADORABLE! 🤗
Omfuckingg I have waited so damn long I am SO EXCITED
YAY! Another episode! I swear I’m always so impatient for these... these are really good though! Good job!
I had to keep pausing the video to jitter and stim because oH HOLY MOTHER OF CHEESE CRACKERS AND SECRET GAY SAUCE YOU GET THE FEELIES MOVING EVERY SINGLE TIME! EEEEEE!!
10:35 ROMAN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY HEART!!!!
19:39 7th grade me is SHAKING at the implications here
I read the title card and I thought someone was flirting with anxiety like "hey anxiety. Eye shadow looks nice tonight."(Smolders)
This is the best way to end my birthday 🤗 I love Virgil so much!💜
Nico's song: "Thomas in the trashcan, Thomas in the trashcan at the maaaall"

NEW MAKEUP

Virgil with purple eyeshadow-
This was very good
Virgil’s eyeshadow... I can’t be the only one! It changed right?! I’m not crazy right?!
AHHHHhHh
All of sanders sides (and asides) should be animatics from now on!  (Didn't do all caps because i forgot.)
“Love is the best ingredient....after salt.” - Thomas Bro that’s a mood.
I LOVE THIS.
the geeking at the end was just adorable-
OH MY GOSH ABDILLUSTRATES YAYYYYY
This video made prinxity shippers lose there coletive minds
This is relatable in so many ways
oh god when Patton finds out about this there's going to be no stopping him. I can imagine Logan's pain at the sheer amount of emotion happening
Title and Thumbnail: *exist*  Prinxiety shippers: *_HYPER NOISES_*
20:28
Why did I start crying...
Thomas im trying not to ship you with yourself but jeez man your making it real hard...
The 95 dislikes are either accidents or from homophobes,
Did anyone else see virgil’s eyeshadow at the end going  💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜💜💜
Virgil’s purple eyeshadow at the end was a nice  touch but I was getting second-hand embarrassment throughout this entire episode 😅 my own Anxiety was telling me to stop watching but I knew I’d regret it if I did so I finished, and I’m glad I did! Virgil is my favorite side, probably because he’s the most relatable
One time I was approached by a person at an event, and was like “i noticed you were eating alone, and nobody should have to do that,” or something along those lines. And I didn’t realize it was flirting until MONTHS LATER, so by all means. Be direct. Especially with me, cuz I am so oblivious.
THOMAS I'M BROKE HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME????  Update: I joined the Patreon.
The Prinxiety moment at the end bro 😂
oh AND CONGRATS THOMAS
YOOOO ABDILLUSTRATES!
This is was so cuteeeeeee. I loved it 💜💜
I love that Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple and sparkly when he's happy 😊💜
Virgil: "okay, thats okay, except its super nOT IM FREAKING OUT" *Thats a mood*
Virgil: "If the relationship is built on Deceit? Is that fair on him?"  Thomas: "You're right. He would be better off without me."  Me: spits out coffee like the cartoon character I am, "He whAT"
Roman x Virgil is very prominent in this and im living for it, also i think Thomas is just too precious xx
I SHIP
AAAAA THE FEELS :)  Also Virgils eyeshadow getting brighter!!! AAAA :)
Anyone else shipping prinxiety just straight up dying.   Like- *the gay though*
22:36 when we see that Virgil's eyeshadow is purple. But seriously this episode was amazing, this is now my new favorite episode. Also, Virgil when he pushed Thomas towards Nico, I was like, "YES! YOU GO VIRGIL!" The animation in this is so good btw, the people who made this animatic are so talented.
THAT WAS THE QUIKEST WAY OF CONFORMING PRINXIETY THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED
Is Virgils eyeliner at the end more purple than usual? I like it.
Why is everyone brushing over the "mistake" lines? Virgil: You're making a mistake. Roman: If I am, I'll add it to the list! That was lowkey sad.
if you agree with me wouldnt it have been cute if romen and  virgle kissed ate the end
Dude: *confronts Thomas and says that he was afraid if Thomas left* Roman and Virgil: *GAY PANIC* (Omg the ending of this video is so cute, i'm crying!)
I REALLY WANT TO PATREON BUT I CANT 😭😭😭
No one: Me through out this whole video: 🥺😁
Could be gayer
My heart ❤️ I love this 😁❤️
Roman x Virgil!!!!
AHHHHHHHH
I am now applying for a job at Dairy Queen, Hot topic, and Starbucks just so I can afford Patron. I’m fully aware I’m not getting any of the jobs.
Bloopers maybe?
I just realized virgil's eye shadow changes depending on his mood and I think that's so adorable
That's gay.
This video was adorable! The only thing I may have done differently was have deceit push Tomas towards the plant, bin, the food line and bathrooms. No lines. Just as another way to convey that Tomas was uncomfortable with speaking up. But that me being not picky and I still loved this. I am keen to see a live action one to be done
V: your making a big mistake R: if I am, then I add it to the list  I felt that on a high personal level.
I dunno, plAnt??
You had me laughing at the intro Thomas, good job.  *Lemme just say the ship material in this video between the sides is a m a z i n g thank you for coming to my TED talk*
As someone who stims (and is kind of made fun of for it by family)... seeing it portrayed in such a positive, casual, NORMAL light is amazing- especially by someone I idolize, and a major comfort character. Thank you, Thomas.
Theory:  Virgil's eyeshadow changes with his mood. For example, when he's really really happy it turns purple, when he's anxious it turns black...my question is...what about his other emotions...what color would it change to for sadness or anger?
THIS IS TOO CUTE OH MY GOD AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH YES!!!
Virgils eye shadow turning more purple the more excited he is, is such a good touch and i love it so so so so much
Virgil’s happy purple eyeshadow 🥺
I just want to point ou that Thomas said "This video is essential viewing for the overall storyline", so it something really important happens in this episode and I just have to know what it is! (Hopefully something related to prinxiety or that change of eyeshadow on Virgil's part)
I'm so proud of him that I started happy crying 😂😂 I'm a goofball
I know this is a personal  question  but my brother wants to know if your a bottom or a top I'm so sorry for this
I love this!!! This could have just been titled: *Gay panic* or: *Gay panic at the mall hihi💘*
Does thomas actually have boyfreind now?
Wholesomeness alert!! 🚨
wow with an ending like that... can't wait for a sides episode about all this self sabotage i'm doing, i mean, thomas is about to do.
omg notice how when virgils happy his eyeshadow is all sparkly and purples!!!
Is anybody else picturing anxiety as Zane and roman as garroth from aphmau series? Like their trying their hardest to be the wing man for their brother vylad lol.
ok can we just take a secondto apreciate VIRGILS EYESHADOWWW I mean Y E S
I am loving this
I LOVE THIS AHHHHHHHH FRICKKK YESSSSSSSSSSS
Me:* having rough and bad day* Thomas: here some prinxiety child Me:* happy* Hektor: dude i tried cheer you up whole day and it didnt work but this video cheer you up? Me: yEsH Hektor: i know you so well kid* pats my hair*
As much as I love this video, I had to pause SO MANY times because I had to let the second-hand gay panic subside. I did not wake up to get stressed by another person's attempt at flirting, but here we are! 😖  I finished the video YOUTUBE DAD YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY 😭😭😭
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH. MY HEAAAAAAAAAAAART. THIS IS SO ADORABLE
Really liked this format🤩🤩
VIRGILS PURPLE UNDER THE EYES IM TRYING
Mr.Flores *rolls r*  Me:A- my last name is flores A-
"Good point guys, I don't want me to be doing this either!" John Mulaney reference, is that you? 😂
This was the warmth my heart needed today
The speech in the bathroom, tho
18:58 Nico, did you mean:*sanders sides*
THIS IS THE MOST WHOLESOME THING IVE SEEN IN MY FRICKING LIFE
Absolutely LOVED the shiny purple eye shadow. I’ve never seen Virgil so excited <3
The ending of the animation seemed like prinxiety ÒwÓ
Too god. Thank you for making another one of these fantastic episodes
GAY EYES. We're going to get hecking Roman. Doing GAY EYES IN THE LIVE-ACTION I JUST CANNOT-
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW MADE ME SCREAM WITH UTTER DELIGHT
OMG VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPYY IM LOSING MY SHFGFGSHDGSAF MY HANDS A SHAKE-
hi thomas!!!!!!!!
AAA ABD worked on this I’m so proud of him!
Bro I relate so much with the love intrest
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW NOW YHIS IS NOT A DRILL
Oh god that was the CUTEST FUNNIEST MOST RELATABLE THING BE STILL MY LITTLE GAY HEART
MY HEART- GOSH DARNIT MY HEART IM CRYING IM CRYING IM SOBBING I HATE IT HERE YOU GUYS SUCK GOD ILY ALL I HATE IT HERE
My experience in flirting. Tips and tricks for modern day flirting. Option 1: Just go up to them. Compliment them and ask if they're single. It's a straight forward approach that would be hard for the other person to misinterpret.  Option 2: Ask their phone number to buy yourself more time to get to know them over the phone. If you are awkward and antisocial then have a friend get their number right before they leave.   (i suck at flirting and i've used both of these tactics so i know they usually work.)
Am I the only one that noticed Virgal blushing when Roman called him brave!?? Does Thomas ship Pincexity!!?!
Anybody else feel called out for hanging out at the mall alone and talking through a mess of a decorated backpack and laptop
Why is the romanx virgil ship not called social anxiety
Today is my birthday and this is the best present in the world! So thank you Thomas for making today amazing!
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!!!! Way to go thomas.
6:48 Ha! Radiohead reference!
When virgil is fleeing Flirty he has purple glittery eyeshadow, now that's cool and something I honestly love  Edit: I said flirty because I don't know what else/exactly to say  2ndedit: omg I just thought of a really good 1 flaterd/ flustered
The internal conversation that we all have when we see that person
Is that… PRINXIETY?!
Me at the end: internally screaming
I am gay and ive missed theese
*sniff*      *sniff* Do i smell a ship?
dude, i literally took one look at the thumbnail art and was like "is that abdillustrates?"
all im saying is that they stim and its canon now thanks bye
NICO!!!!
Just thank you so much Thomas, i loved this video !!! I felt really represented and it was so relatable and good and it made me so happy!!!! Just thank you and congratulations, you all worked so hard on this and it's great <3  Also i completely understand that you might want to start a patreon, and i think it's a great idea, but i'm just getting a bit sad cuz i want to be part of all these things sooo much, but i guess that's it i'll stick with youtube and social media :')
Ooooooooooo I noticed Virgil's eyeshadow became really bright when he's excitedddd. :DDD It's like an adrenaline rush. Ohhhhh I loved this episode, it was so cute and fluffy and a complete mood. 😊
All I can say is AWESOME. So love your vids, Thomas. You remind me so much of someone I went to high school with, way way back in the late 70s. Warms my heart. You are so talented and approach so many things in awesome ways. Keep up the good work!
THOMAS THIS PATREON SOUNDS AMAZING!!!  I HAVE NO MONEY!!!   I WISH THE BEST TO EVERYONE WHO IS ABLE TO JOIN!!!   ALSO I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS EPISODE!!!    T H E G L I T T E R Y P U R P L E E Y E S H A D O W ! ! ! 💜💜💜
4:17 is my favorite part
This is my new favorite gay romcom
If i babysit this weekend ill spend my money i was gonna use on Halloween for ur patreon bc its so worth it
Gerard Gay... laughing so hard I can't BREATHE
Gay eyes.
Okay, but the art style and animation is so good! The artists did an absolutely amazing job portraying these characters and their mannerisms! All the thanks in the world to them!
omg, loved the eyeshadow changes :0 XD
So does Virgil's eye shadow colour change to purple when he is super happy? Did anyone else notice it change at the end from purple to black repeatedly?
22:35 ??   ?????     ?? ?? ? ?? ? WHAT is THIS??💜💜💜
6 times I said “baby no”
**Slightly sad moment**  Dog: barks Virgil: *AH DEMON!!!*
"Thomas, I'm gonna need you to walk around the room. Thank you so much, that helps somehow"  "Thomas, do you need to pee? I think you need to pee"  "Are you sure you don't have to pee?"  Me: *dying*
My question with the eyeshadow is if it really changes when he’s happy or exited then why didn’t he have it in the end of excepting anxiety or in other moments that he was excited or happy?
er mah gersh yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Out of all of the sandersides episodes,THIS IS THE MOST RELATABLE.
“Yeah he is probably better of without me” NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I felt the little "I don't know plant..." In my soul 🥺
I really liked this genuinely bc it gives so much more creativity with an actual space they might not be able to film in. Like being in a mall, I mean it's not impossible but it would be a lot more challenging. It did feel like more of a fan made video but I kinda liked that. 10/10 I want more anamatics.
Yessss all hail prinxiety
DAWWWW SO WHOLESOME ♥️♥️ I LOVE IT
i really just wanna say thank you so much for this video. Recently ive fallin for this girl, and we've started talking more online. Ive found out she's lesbian but ive just been so stressed of messing stuff up i couldn't even look her in the eyes the other day, feelings are kinda complicated but i guess its just a step of faith and bravery. This has encouraged and inspired me to tell her, thanks!
19:48 ........ please someone tell me i am not the only one who had voltron flashbacks at that moment.... wow-  i need help...... please someone tell me i am not alone.....
Also have you heard of princexiety or Roman x Virgil
prinxety shippers are QUAKING
*S-sniffle..* I-I’M NOT CRYING YOU’RE CRYING!-
Also, seeing Virgil so happy gave me so much serotonin.  He is so relatable.
I don’t have this problem because I never go anywhere.
That was adorable 🥺🥺
To much real
OH MY GOOOODDDDDDD JFHDVSJXIDBDBCOHDVEODHRVFUBR Error404 Rowan.exe has stopped working
Have you seen all the nonsense about virgil being a Afton from FNAF
That moment when they r talking a lot about lies, And u know janus was totally secretly Roman that one episode. So u start thinkung that Roman is actually janus in disguise and now ur over thinking things for an hour. :')
The prinxiety shippers are going FERAL right now
Ok does anyone else wanna hear the song that Nico was talking about in the future cause I’m like In love with the idea he gave
Oh my god  1: the animation was amazing 2: oh my god I fangirled so much when he said "you should have just said hi"  3: prinxiety moment
ALEX AND THOMAS?¡??¡' IM DYING THIS IS AMAZING
THAT ENDING IS THE CUTEST EVERRRR!!! I LOVE ROMAN AND VIRGL!
I loved this so much. The art style and the episode itself. OH and the way Virgil's eyeshadow was purple when he was excited. Can't wait for the next episode.
Holy crap, that hit so close to home it hurts!
And they were roomates-
Omfg, this is beautiful
Soooo Virgil gets sparkly purple eyeshadow when he's optomistic and I LOVE HIM  Also, i sense impending emotional issues
Love you Thomas Sanders
How come I didnt get this notification?!?(I wish I saw this earlier)
I have had a similar interaction to this story with people in high school. I would always make sure that people who were out with their sexuality knew that if they needed someone I was there. Yes i started out exactly the same way as Tomas. Awkward, clumsy, and anxiety ridden but in the end it was fun to get to know people.
If Thomas is not a relatable person in public, I don't know who is. I laughed so much, because I could see myself doing the same thing. 😊😳💜
dead. i’m dead. u killed me. this is just what i needed after such a bad day at work thank you sm for the great videoooooo
I absolutely love the animatic style!! It's so cute to see Roman and Virgil yanking Thomas around  :D
AAAAAAAAH THIS WAS SO CUTE 🥰 and omg the purple eye shadow when Virgils happy I love this
This episode killed me
Am i delirious or is this the funniest video Thomas has ever made?
YAY SANDER SIDESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Roman's off hand comment about adding this mistake to the list, but also.... Virgil being brave for Roman and Thomas! And the development for Roman and Virgil's relationship! Be still my beating heart!
AWWW Cute pupper was finishing Thomas's line in the intro! ❤️❤️❤️  It said you can call him Thomas if you wanna get ro- WAIT WHAT THE
Just saying that bathroom guy reminded me of Asahi- if anyone knows who that is-
I want to screm of happines but were i live is 4Am and i dont want mom to be mad (0×O')
How CUTEEEE!!!!!
“join me! no thinking :)”
Virgil's eyeshadow goes purple when he's exited! Important character detail! <333333
Okay WHY is no one talking about the hints at prinxiety in this im SCREAMING
Alternative title “Thomas having a gay panic for 20 minutes straight”
Did any one see the purple eyeshadow on Virgil
Wow i love anxiety's eye shadow purple 💜💜💜💜
Oh gosh that pretending to leave part cringed me to death.
This video feels like a callout
I’m crying tears of joy, my heart can’t take this- I’m so fucking happy we got this episode, and fricking Virgil and Roman getting along and just ahhhhhhhhh (my prinxiety heart man, it’s so full of rainbows rn). Anyways gonna go watch this another 30 times😚
Two words to describe this video: Gay. Panic.
Ahh all the anxiety without getting to meet another gay
Me seeing episode: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  Me see patreon: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  Me seeing Virgil’s purple eyeshadow: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   me...... dying of happiness rn oh my gosh
His eyeshadow goes purple when hes excited!!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😁😁😁
mm i love me some blink 182, paramore and mcr references gerard gay XD
"Gay or nay" Me deciding daily
can we talk about virgil's eyeshadow???
I wish i had money to give to the best gay singer,actor, and creator
nobody: virgil at the end: "aH! DEMON-"
I AM IN LOVE OH MY GOD THOMAS, YOU GUYS, EVERYONE, THIS IS SO SO GOOD IM SO PROUD AND HAPPY AND I JUST AAAAA
Omg! I've been waiting for something like this from y'all and your amazing selves! Congrats on the great idea!
That was the gayest.... cutest thing I’ve ever seen. This makes me want to write a story... I’m trans and bi by the way, not there yet but you’re one of my favorite YouTubers!! I hope you see this, Thomas, you’re the best!!!
That was so cute!!! On a scale of 1-even I cant!
I see the Cinderella’s castle in the background thank you Thomas
VIRGIL WITH SPARKLY PURPLE EYESHADOW?!??!?1?1?1?1?1!?  also Roman side glancing Virgil with little hearts gave me strong feels👀
Did he just make his own sides gay with each other? Like, valid, love it, more please. I just wasn’t expecting it lol
Virgil: "It's like Cyber Stalking.......But in real life."  Roman: "So.............Stalking."  Virgil: "......OH YOU'RE RIGHT!"  That got me! XD
The struggle of being gay
5:18  did Virgil really just make a blink-182 reference?
HIT THE DECK THE SHIPPING FUEL IS OVERLOADING
This video was me screaming at my phone for twenty minutes while my sister questioned my sanity.
When Roman stimmed at 16:21, I felt that
“Thyat was bad."
Thomas you awkward been
I feel called out. Or seen. Can't decide which.
Is Virgil okay, he was kinda acting more like Roman than himself?
Wait did other people notice vigils eyes shadow was PURPLE!! Then it went back to black WHY!?
Have you brought me to tears through relatable circumstance once again?? Mayhaps😞. One of my favorite things about your content is how relatable your videos is that they always revolve around things Fanders, myself included, can relate to. The nostalgia videos hit close for me because they reminded me of this girl I used to talk to that I really liked. We met on Wattpad after I commented on her face reveal and we started messaging each other every day. She made me feel so happy and complete when we would talk, I felt on top of the world. We knew we had feelings for each other, we acknowledged them. She would always call me pet names and check on me. I always asked how her days were and how she was doing with her dancing and martial arts. But then we realized it had to end. Her dad didn’t know about her liking girls and she didn’t want him to find out about us and for me to dragged into her family drama and I didn’t want to complicate her life. So we promised each other we’d always be there if we needed each other and we parted ways. It hurt me to let her go, but I knew I had to. But sometimes I read back through our texts, fooling myself into thinking we could still be something. Your video helps me come to terms with how I feel about her, and for that I cannot thank you enough 💜💜💜.
No one:  Dog: *barks* Anxiety:GAHH DEMON!!!   I’m Anxiety around dogs
I LOVED IT SO MUCH GOSH DANGIT
yall this video make me so fucking happy
"When it's safe to make it, we might be putting up a live-action recreation for our PATRONS!"  My Broke Ass: -_- (All jokes aside, this might be one of my favorite episodes yet.)
We waited for this. What are you doing is the comments?
I am having a break down for Virgil
I can just feel the awkwardness through the video..... Is that..... Normal??? Eh whatever this is still an amazing video❤🌈
AAAAAH omg that was so cute!!!!! Idk why but that just reminded me of In a Heartbeat if anyone remembers that cute lil short
This episode was great! The artists did SUCH an amazing job and the story made me really happy ^_^
I ship itttttghfvhvvg
the bathroom scene gave me so much second hand embarrassment im hiding in the comments
This put such an amazing smile on my face... I love you, thank you💙
8:41 69 AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  im sorry ill stop now
I loved this chapter, even if it was all drawings (which doesn't mean I don't like drawings/comics/animations, I actually love them) it was sooooo cuuute!!!
MY PRINXIETY HEART CAN'T TAKE THISSSSSS
At the end, Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing depending on what he said...
Im litterly gonna cry Roman supporting Virgil is the cutes! 😖😢
PRINXIETY YESSS
Is nobody gonna talk about the little pricixety moment at the end there?! Also this episode was awesome, I loved it it was so fun to watch!!
I love the detail at the end where Virgil's dark circles are purple when he's happy but go black when he starts to panic <3 very nice visual detail
22:35 Oh I LOVE Virgil's purple eyeshadow with glitter!! Look at those sparkling eyes of our dark strange son - they made my day ☺️💜
Thomas: *sees nico* Roman and Virgil: *insert how dare you by Malinda*
16:22
Spoiler on the episode: (in case someone’s looking at the comments without having reached the end of the episode yet XD)         I like how Virgil’s eyeshadow changes on his mood turning all purple and glittery (which I think is roman’s influence on him) when he’s happy and all exited, but turns black again when he’s getting sad about something or get scared by the dog at the very end (it’s super clever and can say long about how he feel and I like it 💜)
VIRGILS SCARED OF DOGS OMG AWWWW BABYYYYY
I LOVE the difference in Virgils eye shadow to show excited anxious and anxious anxious very nice touch. such a cute and exciting video
I RAN TO YOUTUBE—
When Thomas started talking to himself and the animatic showed the stalls I immediately knew what was going to happen....oop-
This video came into my house and called me out on every single level
I love this thank you
Flappy hands!!!!!
VIRGILS EYESHADOW OH MY GOD
Soooo at first I really didn’t understand why Roman and Virgil kept getting on Thomas’ case as he was doing things. And then when Virgil was just like “You did it again”. It dawned on me that Virgil and Roman are both concerned with how much Thomas is lying. And like Roman and Janus (Deceit) didn’t really get along that well, and although we didn’t get to see Virgil and Janus together then,from previous videos (mainly Can Lying Be Good?) we can tell that there’s something there. And to me it honestly doesn’t look like it ended good or left off on a good point. Sooo likkkke that clicked and just like wanted to scream to be honest.
Yu-Gi-Oh!!! I saw you! YOU CANNOT TELL ME OTHERWISE—  ✨👁💧👄💧👁✨
Notice at the end when Virgil's kinda hyped his undereye make up shimmers purple, but when the anxiety flares up it's just matte black?  Whoever came up with that idea is genius <3
What is up with Virgil’s eyeshadow in the end card...?
Gods, this is amazing
I’m just in the intro and I’m scared
VIRGILS EYESHADOWWWW
I love it when virgil is being funny--  its cute and funny
thomas really said prinxiety rights in this episode
Thank you so much, Thomas. In all of this darkness, you and your videos always find a way to make me smile. When I got the notification that you posted a new video, you have no idea how excited I was. I was with my grandpa at the time, and he thought I had won the lottery, that's how excited I was. Your videos have quite literally saved my life, and I couldn't thank you enough for doing what you do. Have a wonderful weekend! I can't wait for the next video, because I know it will make me smile, no matter what it is.
how about we put this on netflix
Virgil's eyeshadow being purple instead of black when he's excited is the cutest thing I've ever seen, maybe I will cry
I will never be over how good Thomas is at changing his voice from character to character
I love the purple eyeliner Virge
9:00 I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING
I continue to be amazed and fall more in love with this series and it’s ability to show how a person learns and grows by two conflicting sides of themselves finding a consensus. How our wants, fears, morals, and safety/health clash and confuse us, and growing up is finding how to balance them all and find what works for you. I’ve been here since the begging (a bit of vine as well) and I congratulate these wonderful group of people for their brilliant minds, kind hearts, and genuinely. Keep up the good work!
Is nobody going to notice the fact that vrigil is wearing purple Isadeo
Thomas is disaster gay confirmed
I love this so much
Wait does virgils eyeshadow change according to the level of anxiety?
This is so adorable 😍 🥰😭
I HAVE 0 WORKS
anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black and back?
NO it finished ಥ╭╮ಥ
ITS HEREEEE
Just watching this made me want to click out of the video because of  all of the awkwardness, but I still watched all of it Bc it was amazing. (Still paused it multiple tho)
Can you make more videos like this? This was awesome!!!
If you fail or get hurt it’s not necessarily a waste of time as long as you learned something about yourself.
Can you feel the love tonight
This is so relatable as a lesbian girl who-- doesn't know how to approach girls-- Anyway:   "Gay eyes?" "GAY E YE S"  such a mood--
I am grinning SO MUCH right now
the happy purple eye shadow
Where's Patton in all of this isn't he mortality? Like your heart and love and joy!
This episode hit very close to home 😂😂
Broo.. The fucking anxiety along LIKE CMON GUYS
Did joan voice the pins dude?  And is this the way thomas is telling us that he has a boyfriend now?
Thomas: *AAAAAAAAA* Virgil: *AAAAAAAAA* Roman: *AAAAAAAAA*
I was so happy watching this video that I was doing all the happy stimming things and then the fact that you started doing so too just made it even more uncontrollable. Amazing video omg
When your broke but wanna join the patreon-
This is precious in every way
Janus in this video "......."
This video was so cute, I loved it!
AHHHHHH!!!!! That was so cute!!!!!!!!💙💙💙💙💙💙
OKAY BUT VIRGIL PUSHING THOMAS TO MAKE ROMAN FEEL BETTER ADJAJDJJASA IM DEAD BYE
YASSS MY PRINXIETY SENSES HAVE AWOKEN!! 🤣🤣🤣 I can't believe Roman agrees and worked with Virgil.. 😊😊😊 You did a great job once more Thomas Sanders 💖💖💖
Virgil: “that’s like cyber stalking but real life”  Roman: “sooo... stalking?”  Virgil: “Oh! You’re right!”  One of the best moments for me, I felt it deep in my soul.
This just made me so happy and I smiled through the entire thing. I was already filled with joy just seeing the video in my recommendations. This honestly is so great, amazing and absolutely fantastic.
as a button maker, this video really fcking called me out with “pintrovert” HDHFJFKKK
:)
"Will Deceit continue to be the answer to all your problems? Is that fair to him?" For a second I thought he was talking about Janus which I thought would be an excellent "When you see it" type moment.  Edit: I made this comment before I finished the episode but I want to talk about the end of the episode without making a new comment so I'm here to say AH MY GAY LITTLE HEART
Thomas I haven’t start the video, but right now I’m going to something super hard on the department of love and I really  lost here, I know here’s no answer, but hope your video brings me happiness ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Virgil at the end: looking around all shifty like Me: Virgil what the fu- *deep voice* what are you hiding?
My mom thought you were Ryan Reynolds.
"I dunno... Plant." Is some kind of mood
Yay! 😊😄
Wait does this mean Prinxiety is canon ... btw good for you Thomas
This is amazing
Let's be real folks, this is prime Prinxiety material right here. Both the bois being real gay dads.
I've screamed in public upon seeing the notification
Can't spell Romance without Roman (Patton would be proud of me)
does anyone know if the patron stuff comes with subtitles?
VIRGIL SMILED IN THE END CLIP. OMGGGG AAAAAAA
Flight or flight
Pinxiaty shipers enters the chat😂
I was crying of happiness I love this so much ;^; <3

How are the other sides gonna react to this lol
DOES ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES TO A LIGHTER PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY LIKE OMGGGGG💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I just wanna join!! But I'm in Philippines T^T
“TALK TO THE GUY” (or in my case girl) I didn’t want to be called out
MY LITTLE GAY HEART CANT TAKE THE CUTENESS
I love you so so much  I love you so so much  I love you so so much  I love you so so much
Very cool Thomas
Me at the end of the animated part: princxiety!!!!
Virgil with purple eyeshadow and smiling, "I don't have the vocabulary to describe what I'm feeling inside, but for me it's very unordinary". Am I the only one that gets some prinxiety vibes?
Omg did no one else notice that virgil’s eyeshadow turns purple at the end when he’s happy!
This is like an animated AND VOICED fanfiction and I love it xDD
But that moment when Virgil saw Roman looking so sad and then started panic breathing and yeeted Thomas forwards!! The fanfiction writers are gonna have a hayday with that-
OMG! IM FINALLY SOMEWHAT EARLY!!!!
Bro the way Thomas virge and Roman screamed at the end is exactly how I screamed
Virgil and Roman are me and my friends when we see a cute guy
I loved that please tell me that was real :o
Is it based on somthing that hapened? Who did nico voice?
Hey Virgil.... what’s going on with ur eyeshadow? I’m digging it, but I have a feeling... there’s something deeper.....
When I watched the intro i felt rllly happy I’ve missed sander sides
I’ve been subbed for 5 years and they finally made a video in years
❤️❤️❤️ Awwww❤️❤️❤️ Virgil is so excited it makes me so happy!!
....I just... like... CAN WE JUST AKNOWLEGE HOW WHOLESOME THIS EPISODE WAS????
my headcanon is that while Virgil is changing and coming out of his comfort zone, he's turning into a better Side. I present my headcanon: Virgil is no longer Anxiety, he is Adrenaline. edit: that's why his eyeshadow is lightening. it's showing that while he's still anxious, his anxiety can push Thomas to do more things instead of hiding in his shell.
IM 6 HOURS LATE WAIT WHAT IS THIS OH MY GOD
OH. MY. GOSH. THIS WAS MORE WORTH THE WAIT THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WAS WAITING FOR IT. <3
I love this vid because I have social anxiety about my sexuality and this vid helps me thank you Tomas Sanders
Virgil is the cutest thing im never getting over him!!!! Ahhhahhahahsgfkajdhgkkajahflgjajajkdjfj
Please tell me I wasn't the only one who screamed with them?! I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM!!!
I may or may have not cry while watching the struggle in the bathroom and now I'm I'm salty and crying xD  Hahahahaha I'm still crying and laughing and I don't know if I have a heart anymore
Personally I prefer animation over the live-action
So beautiful!! Nico is absolutely lovely 💕
MY HEARTTTTTTT DUDUDUEUDUDUEUUDUDUDUDUEUDUDE!!!!!
Im ab to freaaaak out
Me throughout the whole video : Smiling like an idiot Giggling like an idiot Crying like an idiot Giggling like an idiot Smiling like an idiot (why did I make this Comment Lmao)
Roman is precious in this animatic :D
when Roman put his hand on Virgil's shoulder-  My shipping reflexes: The fastest fanart in the west
Romen eyes whem he saw him are so pretty!
i'm not crying, your crying
this video hit So Close To Home my gods
Omg it's real! (You know if you know lol)
“This Sander Sides will be presented as a animatic!” Me: EEEEEEEE!!!
THE KING HAS UPLOADED!!!
Them walking back to their spots at the end before freaking out
I LOVED ITTTNJSKCJSJFJCJLCGKKDJVDKSDNJGJ
I CAN'T STOP GRINNING OMIGOSH THIS WAS SO CUTE AJDBSHBSBSDF
I WANT TO JOIN YOUR PATREON BUT IM SCARED CUZ I DON’T HAVE MONEY AND MY PARENTS WOULDN’T LIKE THAT-
Wow this is amazing! The expressions are so beautiful😍
These r so cute and make me cry 😂😂
THIS MAKES ME BELIEVE EVEN MORE IN A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROMAN AND VIRGIL  AAAAAAHHHHHH
WHEN I TELL YOU I SQUEALED WHEN HEARD HIS NAME WAS NICO. JUST like Nico Di’Angelo!!!
okokokokok, while I love this episode and love reading people's comments, I have to point out something. I might be wrong, but when Virgil says "Is that fair to him?" he isn't referring to how Thomas is overworking Janus with how many lies he's been making, he's referring that it isn't fair to Nico for Thomas to have started this relationship on a lie. Once again I might be wrong but I think this was the intention, but I also thought the exact same thing at first. That being said I adore this episode and am I the only one who feels bad for bathroom guy? Thomas made his day, just to burst his bubble. Poor guy.
Prinxiety Moments!
Omg I LOVE IT
Virgil with purple eyeshadow?  YES👏🏻QUEEN👏🏻
OMG HIS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE INSTEAD OF BLACK
I'll have the boiled mayo carrot-" Gay panic 100-100,000 real quit
I saw flirting and anxiety in the title and somethings in the episode that was too anxious for me to watch and nearly just left. But I am glad I didn’t. I loved it, it was amazing. Thank you. 😁
I hope bathroom stall guy is doin okay
Me stimming out of pure excitement  while watching this: Virgil telling thomas to do the same stim I’m doing:  My brain: *IlLuMiNaTi MuSiC iNtEnSiFiEs* (Also thanks for the Prinxiety man my happiness scale needed that)
Chicken nuggets
OMG ALEEEEEX I LOVE HIS ART
This is my new favorite, oh my god I love this so much Thomas thank you
THE PURPLE ON VIRGIL!!
As a bi girl with social anxiety this is painfully a mood
WAIT, please say that story was a true one
the prinxiety stans are S C R E E C H I N G  its me. im screeching.
Ok but that love story was absolutely beautiful. The art, the story, the voice acting, AND the character development was AWESOME!!
“i dunno. plant.”  i’ve never heard such wisdom😂
What a great episode! Nice job working around lockdown limitations in a really creative way.
Virgil's eye shadow change ( 22:37 - 23:05)
Dude, am I seeing hints to the possible of a growing romantic relationship between Virgil and Roman?
But Nico’s song could be a metaphor for Roman’s life
I’m shipping Virgil and Roman even more now 🤣
Okay but can we talk about Thomas’s monologue? That was so beautiful I teared up 🥺
I'm vibrating and squealing and just generally losing all composure I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!
My bf got this notification during set construction and I *screamed*  Edit: So this got me all happy-stimming
This had me squeezing for days.
This was honestly adorable. I was lucky enough to come home to the neighborhood cat waiting for me,  so I got to watch the entire episode with him napping in my lap. 🥰 I would love to see a live action remake,  but I did enjoy the humor and feeling that came from this style of animation. Great job!!
Prinxiety head canon: the two of them are just showing up in the middle of dates
I CANT JOIN , IM POOR THOMAS, UGH I WANT TO SO BAD
Literally my anxiety in a nutshell
I saw this and my brain went: ✨PANIK✨
The purple eyeshadow indicating virgils excitement is amazing i love it so much omg
“Shut up emo” 🥺🥺😂😂
Did anyone notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing from purple to Black throughout the video?
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW IS AMAZING OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH
IT’S A BLESSED DAY TO WITNESS THE ANIMATED GAY
THE ART IS WONDERFUL 😍 What awesome artists 😭 this is beautiful!! All of the details and the voice acting are magnificent!      And is it just me, or 14:34 thomas drags out the s sounds in his words when he lies to the guy or am I reading too much into it
Not thomas egging on prinxiety MY HEART💀❤️💜❤️💜🌈💕🌈💕😫😁🥰
Ah demon!
ARE WE IGNORING THE MOMENT WHEN ROMAN CALLED VIRGIL CUTE AT 8:18 ?????
Holy moly this episode is so amazing and filled me with so much joy :) I recently had that experience with my now girlfriend and can relate haha. Thankyou so much Thomas!💛💛💛
Finally a new one!!!! ... I’m supporting and loving everything in this. It’s at 69k likes..
So Virgil is basically adrenaline
Thomas, I got so sick this morning. Fever, runny nose, upset tummy, coughing. You name it and this made my day!
Um hello?? What was Virgil thinking about at the end right before the dog barked? The camera zoomed in all dramatically.
Noice
I love everything about this, this makes me very happy💜❤ And I'm so glad you worked with Alex! I love his artwork so much!
In his THIRTIES!?!? DOD GAMMIT YOU AGE LIKE WINE!!!!
I found out recently that when my fiance and I were first starting to get to know each other they were drawing an elaborate diagram of our chemistry classroom and paid a football player to stall traffic to the classroom so that they would have enough time to steal the seat that I sat in every day. They didn't know my name at the time so they just put "leather jacket chemistry girl" on their elaborate battle plan in their chemistry notebook. We had a chemistry professor that talked like Yoda, that's not relevant at all. Anyway, they were trying to get my attention...it worked.
Virgils purple eyeshadow
IM KIND OF EARLY LETS GO
Why does the eye shadow on Virgil keep changing from purple to black near the end. I seems to happen when he is happy.
Me seeing that Thomas uploaded: *violently shaking my hands in excitement*  Virgil: Ahh do something with your hands they're just hanging there *Me all of a sudden feeling called out*
OMG I WANNA BE A PART OF HIS PATREON BUT IM POOR
this episode make me ridiculously happy like the references, the writing, the animation, virge and ro's relationship + character development, virgil's eyeshadow and stimming -- this was perfect as always!  edit: i'm stimming so much rn- this made me so happy oh my gosh
Can we talk about how Virgil's eyeshadow is all bright purple and sparkly when he's the excited kind of anxious and immediately turns black when he's the actually anxious kind of anxious xD
*THE PRINCXIETY INTERACTION DFHASFHADFQJSJDFSK*
This animation had me wondering how it would've looked if this was a normal Sander Asides video.  I mean the trashcan scene would've been hilarious to see you do irl...
The triple gay panic at the end card is one of the best things I’ve ever seen!!! Also I adore seeing the escapades of cartoony Thomas, Virgil and Roman! The art style’s just wonderful!!
All of Virgil's nicknames ever given to him: 1. Dark stormy knight 2. Creepy cookie 3 .Brad pitiful 4. Worry wart 5. Friendo 6. Panic at the everywhere 7. Jack smellington 8. Incredible sulk 9. Charlie frown  10. Virge 11. Robert downer junior 12. Shadowy but angelic song bird 13. Kamlia the chicken 14. Vomity central 15. A mean one 16. Kylo friends 17. Bat winged cherob  18. One angry man over there 19. Perp man  20.Sunshine 21. Emo 22. Emo nightmare 23. Hot topic 24. Wet blanket 25. Chemically unbalanced romance 26. Negitave Nancy 27. Jason toddler 28. Jerky mcjerk face 29. Supreme dark overlord of negitave comers 30. Sirly temple  31. J Delightful 32. Dr gloom 33. Fairest of them all 34.Count woaloft 35.Marilyn Monrose 36. Sweet and sour misunderstood shadowling 37. Poor little anxious baby  38. Gerard gay 39: tiger 40. Bird brain  There's a lot😂 Also most of these are from Roman which I love😂
8:05 Roman, please.
YAS! this was so amazing! the animation was PERFECTION.
Everyone else: Talking about Virgil’s eyeshadow.   Me: Nico sounds similar to Rico from the last Sanders ASides.
We can live like Jack and Sally if you want         I MISS U I MISS U....
are they trying to tell us prinxiety is canon
THE END IM NOT CRYING
Tomas your super awesome and the life lesson stories you make are like super unique. Love ya.
Ack- the fact that Virgil was getting anxious and started to hyperventilate just like made it feel so real
Am I the only one wondering if Thomas has a boyfriend again now?!😂
Dear Thomas. You are amazing and so are the sides, and you are hilarious!❤
can't believe this guy has a yugioh pin, he's obviously the perfect man
“It’s like cyber stalking.... but in real life!”  “Sooo.... stalking.”  “OmG yOuRe RiGhT!”
Patton in a skirt, new asides, prinxiety Stan’s are going crazy on tumblr..........     This is a good weekend 🥰🥰🥰
AAHHHH
I'm living for Virgil's purple eye shadow!!!
Did anyone notice that virgil change eyeshadow
Virgil's eyeshadow was freaking amazing! OMG I wish i could do that 😍
Ooooh Thomaaaaaaaaaaas you wouldn't happen to have a boyfriend now, would yoooooooou?😏
Ah this is the most exited I’ve seen Virgil and his makeup variation eeeee🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
That fact the Virgils eyeshadow turns purple when he’s happy just made my day so much better! 🖤💜
"I wasnt testing you. I was just panicking" Mood
That was sooooo  coooool !!!
THE ARTISTS SHIP IT!
Roman: ....bravery Virgil: *blushes* Me: JSJSJDJSJSKIDIEJD PRINXIETY IS GOING TO BE CANON AAAAAAAAHHHH
Its awesome
THOMAS ARE YOU ACTUALLY GETTING A BOYFRIEND?!?!  THIS EPISODE HIT ME IN THE FEELS AND I LOVE IT
Roman: This introvert really likes talking about himself Me: *le gasp* it me
not me reading the title and thinking that all the sides would be flirting with anxiety to get him used to it but just embarassing him in the end
wait a minute please tell me there's someone here who listens to wtnv because I suddenly realized I'm getting lowkey cecilos vibes from the voices- 😳
When i saw the title i thought this episode would be about Thomas and the sides actually flirting with the concept of social anxiety and not about flirting while having social anxiety.
Ok this was STUNNING but also we just absolutely ignored all the roman angst from the last one and that is giving me whiplash
I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!! We need remi in this
When your too broke to be able to sign up for the patreon: im sorry thomas! :( i love your videos!
excuse me, the little hearts from roman at the end? prinxiet? hello?
😽😻😻AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GOOD FOR YOU 😻THOMAS
Thomas' monologue was going and I was like aw this is so sweet and then I remembered he was saying it to himself in a bathroom mirror
*IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRYIM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA CRY*
I cant I love it
Aight imma change the title to something wayyy more accurate   *"thomas sanders being a simp for 24minutes gay"*  (pls get the pun im begging u)
Oh my this gave me this BIGGEST SMILE EVER 💛💛💛 THOMAS THIS WAS AMAZING!!! Well done!
Why did toilet man remind me of Asahi
Ahhhhhhhhhh finally I have been waiting for a long time for this day to come and it has. I can tell why it took so long. Love you Thomas❤️
Omg !!! ❤️
CAN WE PLEASE APPRECIATE VIRGIL LOOKING AT ROMAN AND THEN INTO THE DISTANCE IJ THE ENDCARD BEFORE THE DEMON DOG?? PLEASE??
22:31              OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG   LOOK AT VIRGIL!!!!!!
the fact that roman and virgil are *slowly* becoming more comfortable with one another((‘:
Is it just me or does anyone else just adore the way they animated the hands??  Just me? Okay
The ending felt like a Pixar short, when did this small, silly little skit thing get so big and complex and amazing?  Also - prinxiety shippers rejoice!
No one: Absolutely no one: Roman's puns:        Also... Virgil's eye shadow in this episode is so pretty!! I love it!😍💜💖
These happy bois are giving me so much serotonin right now! This is amazing 😁
✨gerardgay✨
This is all so cute!!! Also Virgil's new eye shadow is awesome, it's purple and shiny but changes to black when he gets anxious and I just can't cope
“I’m not _Max,_ I’m prince Roman!”
This whole episode I kept saying "I love these boys" Or "I love them so much" This helped my mood so much!! I was about to have a panic attack but than I seen this was posted and I got so happy so quickly
I just died at the trashcan scene xD
bro this is such a mood, this is exactly what goes though my head           also there’s so much prinxiety my heart :)))
When the guy handed him the food I started panicking with Roman and Virgil I was like “As him for his number, no wait that’s too weird” and when the guy said something that they couldn’t hear I started panicking even more
I am considering this a birthday present. Thank you, Thomas!
I cant belive im 6 hours late TnT
Oooooh this is lovely but *ohhhh* my secondhand anxiety! 😂😅 (Also my extroverted bi self: Just say you like his pins! Just say you like his pins!)
I loved this episode so much! Also I hope to see Pat and Logan soon! ❤
I love everything about this video. Awesome job to everyone who worked on this. Simply amazing.
When you scream at the same pitch as Thomas because Virgil has happy eyeshadow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely amazing.  . . . Patton was there though he wasn't. Beautiful.
Wait wait wait you have a special someone??? A boyfriend omg omg ○•○
VIRGILS EYESHADOW AAAAAUGG!!!!   Edit: GRRR I FORGOT TO COMMENT ON VIRGILS LITTLE “you can live like jack and sally.... if you want....” UGH THE BLINK 182 REFRENCES! I LOVE THIS EPI!
I like the end, cause virgil is like : You touch me so i fall in love with you😂❤️
every piece of this video i- jshahdhshdgg *insert gay keyboard smash here*
omg i love this
This is the perfect representation of what it means to be  d i s a s t e r  g a y
Virgil's new eyeshadow tho aaaaaaaaaaaa
I. Adore. Prinxiety.
HOLY YES
Hold up, did anyone else notice how, when virge was super happy, his eye shadow turns purple??
I'm totally not rewatching this for the 3rd {4th?} time—
This entire video gave me anxiety
WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE???
I shouldnt relate this hard
Im quirming around my bed     Help
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Omg this better be a true story
"I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" I dont why that killed me so much!
“Its like cyberstalking but in real life!”  “You mean stalking...”  “....oH YOUR RIGHT”  Lol
for some reason i thought you were like,,, gonna flirt,, with social anxiety,, like as in the disorder? idk-
AHHHH WHY DIDNT I GET THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS!!! Nooooo im late  Edit: OML THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING IN EVERY WAYY AHHHHHH IM DYINGG THAT WAS SO CUTEEEE EEEEE
Has no noticed the purple eye-shadow on vigil
Virgils facial expressions throughout the animatic are priceless, and his eyeshadow changing color with his excitement proves to me even more that his eyeshadow is actually just markings and he denies it because he's self conscious-   i LoVe ThIs.
Tomorrow I have a date with a guy and I'm kind of nervous. I met him on tinder and was kind of scared because I'm non binary, but yesterday he said he just saw it on my profile and asked what my pronouns are. I'm now really happy. Tomorrow's go a be a good day. Wish me luck!
This was a interesting video I liked it
YAYYYYYYYYY
Hhhhh I just finished the whole video and excuse me while I scream because I loved absolutely everything about that I don't even know where to start and I think my brain short-circuited and is now bellowing "PURPLE EYE SHADOW" on repeat yeah I love this kbye. <3
VIRGILSEYEBAGSTURNPURPLEWHENHESHAPPY!!!!
This whole thing is Virgil X Roman and I love it and this is totally what happens in real life
ok 20 why is that person a bean(bean is something so cute and preshos that you dont know what to call them)
Roman if thomas is old so are you. You literally look exactly like him and have probably been around since he was a baby lmao
Anybody just saw this and silently screamed because you were in public
Virgil: you’re making a mistake! Roman: if I am, then I’ll add it to the list!   Oh...baby..🥺
AHHHH I LOVE THE WAY VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW KEPT CHANGING BETWEEN PURPLE AND BLACK!!  Okay okay so I'm pretty sure Virgil with black eyeshadow means anxious and Virgil with purple eyeshadow means happy/excited. At least I think that's what was implied, and ahhhhacfdsdadsfkdk YEAH ❤ I love Virgil and I want him to be happy too!!!!!!! Big appreciation towards the artists in this episode as well 😊❤❤❤❤
Thank you so much for the content you provide. <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 I'm so happy rn (^ ^)
I love how when Virgil is happy his eye shadow turns light purple
Video: plays  Me: AAAAHHHHH! OMG! AAAAAHHHHHH!
This was so good!
Content/excited virg makes me c r y
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL’S CHANGING EYESHADOW AT THE END
Oh wow, how did you find all this footage of me talking to the girl I had a crush on in middle school. Man, I can’t believe 12 year old me actually thought I just really wanted to be her friend.
That was too cute-
Aww, I like how the end showed how similar anxiety and excitement can be! Also stimming!
When Roman put his hand on Virgil’s shoulder I was just like, ✨Prinxiety✨
Virgil happy makes me so happy!!
its all down hill from here !!
So very fun story: Im with the color gaurd and at my school and we were stretching outside before a football game and my team they were looking at the opposing team football cause they thought they were cute (I didn’t care I’m not single) but they did and wanted their snaps but they had to get it at the end of the game we get there and half of team was on the busses and I volunteered to talk to one of the football boys and get theirs snaps so I ran and stopped one of the boys and asked for numbers 28 29 and 33 and the guy bangs on the window and gets one of the guys attentions and they come to the window I talk to them and end getting three girls the snap of three guys they thought were cute. Moral of the story it pays to have confidence sometimes or to have a confident fiends do stupid stuff for you
Every bit about the stickers and pins was too true. Loved the pintrovert bit!
Love the color change under virgil's eyes where when he was hopeful it was purple but when Thomas asked if they were ready for it the color changed to black. That's some nice detail I also love the animation and the storyline ❤❤❤
15:42 Virgil: Will deceit continue to be the answer to all your problems? This line stood out to me a lot when rewatching considering what happened last episode. And the amount of angst Roman had near the end almost killed me.
Me and Virgil would get along very well. I’m the embodiment of anxiety and creativity.
He's in his 30s he might as well be 60
VIRGIL IN PURPLE EYESHADOW GIVES ME SEROTONIN
THEY GON’ MAKE SWEET, SWEET LOVE! ... ... ... I approve.
FINALLY
✨this felt like a gay panic callout and I feel targeted✨
That ending: when Roman calls Virgil (if that’s how you spell it) brave and it kinda looks like Virgil is blushing Me: *S H I P*
hold on... “is that fair to him?” uh.. uh.. virge? .... uh
Virgil talking about how stickers and buttons are the introverts ways of talking about themselves  Me who has 15 buttons on my purse (probably and counting), as well as a pride one: *chuckles* I’m in danger! (Seriously though I feel hella called out. Loved the episode!)
I missed these
19:50 - 20:00      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  (My vocal cords hate me right now)
GERAD GAY I'M SCREAMING
I got an add after the part where Virgil and Roman watch Thomas and Nico sit and talk but the add didn't have the yellow bar or the other add stuff and the voice over sounded like Thomas's voice so I thought it was just a random joke for the video
Thomas: And if i dont act on these feelings now i know I’m going to regret it Virgil: *looks in romans direction* My prinxiety brain: i see i see *writes it down*
AND ILLUSTRATES YEEED
22:54 the HeeHee 🥺
I don’t know if it’s just my device I’m watching this on, but is no one gonna comment about Virgil’s sorta purple eye makeup! I freaked out when I saw that! Aside from that... OMG THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! I FREAKING LOVE SANDER SIDES!!!!! AMAZING JOB!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!!
I almost couldn't watch it because I have extreme empathy and had to pause like 20 times just so I could calm down 😣👨‍❤️‍👨❤️it was amazing though
Yessssssssssssssssss
Was it just me, or did anyone else notice that Virgil's eye shadow changed depending on Thomas's mood at that last part? Like Thomas is pumped up and really excited, its that GORGEOUS glittery purple. But when Thomas is overthinking things and starting to get worried... Its that black that we're used to from Virgil, maybe even darker. So now I'm wondering if Virgil is becoming like a Neutral side- He's both a Dark and Light cause he's showing signs of becoming that feeling you get when you're pumped full of adrenaline (basically becoming a walking Adrenaline Rush) or something of that nature... Theory cap is on, never  have put it on before but IT IS ON NOW
14:22 I can’t stop laughing at their faces, I freakin love this episode
I feel this episode so much it’s not even funny.
This is probably my favorite animatic ever
PURPLE EYESHADOW  PURPLE EYESHADOW   PURPLE EYESHADOW   PURPLE EYESHADOW   MY FACE IS RED AND I CAN BARLEY BREATHE I ACTUALLY NEED HELP
Did this really happen?
I feel seen by virgil telling thomas to like shake his hands and move around when he was excited like- stimming-
I doubt my sexuality at least once a day and after watching this, I don't have a doubt in my mind that I am very very aro, I couldn't relate to a single moment (okay, that sounds rude, I don't mean it like that, just...I feel at peace with myself and that's not something I feel often, thank you)
This felt like a whole book! I just wanted to keep reading! It's so dang perfect!! You, Joan, Erin, Alex, Brei, Quil, Manny, Davi, Leo, Dahlia, AJ, and Lev did SO WELL! I absolutely love it! Everything from the animation to the voice acting to the flow. It's so great! I know we're all a bit panicked at the current situation, but your videos help shed some light. I'm sure I can speak for all of us fanders, we love you.
OMGOMGOMGOMG PRINXIETY IS MY OTP like honestly this just made my heart explode
This episode is so amazing!  All the art is so beautiful, there are so many funny moments, the monologue is amazingly written, heck the whole episode is amazingly written!  Its definitely my favourite episode so far, everyone really outdid themselves on this epiode :) Have a nice day if you're actually reading this!
Virgil, NOOOOOO. Say Nevada right!
ive never related to a video more
Virgils eyeshadow
i'm sorry, his name is nico....like um...nico di angelo.? who's also gay...i'm sorry, i'm just....🏳️‍🌈
Virgil all throughout the bathroom scene “ I like to sit on surfaces that aren’t meant to be sat on”
This was so CUTE! ♥
Procrastinating my math homework to watch this ✊
hhhhhhhh
VIRGIL???? PURPLE EYESHADOW?????????
I was just so happy wile Watching this i loved it so mutch 💕💗
I got so happy when I saw this I was hyperventilating-
YEEEEEAAAAH
Does Virgil's eye shadow turn purple when he's excited?
Me at a store in line, with a goth girl like me in front of me: *trying to say something and communicate* Her passing me: I like your mask :)  Me: *wearing a danganronpa mask* I-u-uhM-eh- My mom: she likes your shoes! Me mentally: tysm mom-
Virgil: *pushes Thomas* nO SIR  Also Virgil: *see's heartbreak on Roman's face* yeS SIR
Hm, just noticed something.  When virgil is exited, his makeup turns a light purple, it's really freaking cute.
Oh my god you did it you became a cartoon again
im just gonna straight up cry i saw this was uploaded and i literally almost cried
Anyone else notice how at the end Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing? Like when he was super excited the eyeshadow was purple but when he was less excited the eyeshadow was black.
that was. so beautiful i’m—
I am crying omg THOMAS!!!!!! PLEASE FIND HAPPINESS MY CHILD!!!!
that animation is every gay panic i've ever had except I don't end up talking to the girl
Prinxiety is actually coming true!
This is me... this is my life  lol. Social anxiety is really difficult and my self defense is just saying stuff like," I like music." Or General convos cause I get nervous when I am alone or if there are too many people around. Relationship wise is pretty similar, I don't want to assume so I don't take a chance.
thomas: “i subtweeted about him” roman: “that’s my boy!” virgil: “what’d you say??” thomas: “had a good day today hehe 💘” virgil, suddenly with more black eye makeup: “huh 😃...delete it”
OMG I LOVE THIS EPISODE!!!!!!!
Am I the only one who noticed Virgil’s eyeshadow changed to purple when he was more confident?
I missed youuuu Thomas's, I love you videos
I don't even care if this wasn't live-action, I had way too much fun laughing at all of the interactions,,, and here I thought I was gonna be handed a plate full of angst-
Roman: “Thomas needs to rise to the occasion-“  Me: -OF OUR NEW NATION!!!!!! HERE COMES THE GENERAL!!!!!
YES!!!!! this made my days go from bad to great, I loved this video so much and I kept randomly screaming from excitement at some points in the video (^W^) and I think I annoyed my family With the excitement
did you just...make a video about one of the biggest problems in my life...? KING  edit: Literally today I saw a girl with a lot of patches on her jacket and I didn't see a lot of them but I saw a gay flag and I couldn't talk to her so....god damn it Thomas :)
This episode made me so happy, until the ending. Virgil’s bright purple mascara turned black when Thomas asked if he was ready for a relationship. I just want Roman to have someone to gush over—he loves to be in love.
Am i the only one wonder if this ever happened to anyone lmao
Imagine if Thomas's outline had turned yellow every time he lied
Yes yes Yes yes Yes yes Yes yes Yes yes
is it just me or did virgil's eyeshadow change from purple to black when he started judging thomas for the tweet?
Seeing Roman and Virgil team up is honestly exactly what I needed today
Everything was so happy! And then there was Virgil’s eyeshadow at the end and I cried.
wait a minute you are gay OMG i don't know, this is so cute :D
Ahhhhhh! I love this! I love it so much! Thank you, Thomas!
OK the ‘will deceit be the answer to all of our problems?’ Parts just make me not trust janus a lot more-

Did nobody see how Virgil blushed when Roman put his arm on his shoulder
A
I'm freaking out over Virgil's plot relevant eye shadow right now. Also the purple is absolutely beautiful.
The ~gay eyes~  One time I got an eyebrow slit compliment at a grocery store. I panicked and said thanks really loudly and then I ran away :')
At 22:35 who noticed virgils eyeshadow
Moves real smooth~~ XDD
Great vid 👌🏾
"umm.. plant?" Same tho This is like my entire flirting aesthetic... Or social interaction in general really
*Gay eyes*
“you’re a creep, you’re a weirdo...” me: *starts singing radiohead* “...what the hell are we doing here?” oh hELL YEAH THAT WAS A REFERENCE
YES VIRGIL!!! THE HOMEBOY IS BACK!!!
Thomas did this happen for you in real life? If so I'm soooooooooo happy for you     ;)

THAT WAS GREAT
THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I LOVED IT OMG
This is amazing!! I don't think I've ever related to Roman so much in my entire life
Dang, so much pressure on the future with this guy. My anxiety is more like what the hell are words!!
Also did anyone notice Virgil's eye shadow in the end went from purple to black?
It's cute but very dramatic

THIS WAS SO FRICKIN ADORABLE AND I CAN RELATE ON SO MANY LEVELS THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS
I cant stop Rewatching 19:28 bc that's honestly my favorite moment here until the panic that is the end card Nico: well, let's not waste this one Roman: *in disbelief* shut up Virgil: *shook* shut up Roman: *really happy* shut up! :D
DID VIRGIL HAVE PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END?!?! VIRGIL IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING
Oh my GOSH I LOVE abdillustrates! THIS IS SOOOO COOL
Virgil and Roman's relationsip has improved so so much since the first episodes and it literally hurts me how much i love it

VOLTRON VIBES: anxiety: Keith  Creativity: lance Morality: hunk Logic:pige
22:48 ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL EYESHADOW?!??
OMG!!! So awkward and cute. I teared up~ So wholesome. YwY
Did anyone notice Virgil's make up like dude 😯 it's so pretty 🤩
24:01 Virgil’s eyeshadow changes! I can’t be the only one who thinks this is to do with something.
Happiness videos. Yes.
Yo I had a dream about this episode and I’m shook
Baaaaw! When Virgil's happy his makeup gets bright and shiny! That's adorable.  Also... Like... WHY IS JANUS RUNNING THE PATREON!? I feel like I should be concerned.
I’m fangirling so much!!!! I loved the animation so much!!!
I love that here they acknowledge that, while they're all still like "DARK SIDES, AHH", they mention that Janus is involved in Thomas lying, and they don't wanna overwork him with Thomas lying so much.
If I had money I would so donate to your patreon.
Omfg! this is so cute!
May I ask is this is real the story I ship it
i'm sorry but is no one gonna mention how virgils eyeshadow changed w his emotions orrrrrrrr
anyone notice virgil's eyeshadow was purple at the end scene? :0
Yikes im 5 hours late
i love how roman knows how to use gay talk-
Virgil's eyeshadow change at the end when he feels!!! Nice touch ✨
*Karrot King*
I was crying
Loving Virgil's end card eyeshadow!! Work it boy
I love the fact that virgil's  eyeshadow changes from the normal black to purple

OMG!!!! Virgil excited/in love has sparkly purple eyeshadow!!! He’s soooo adorable🥺🥰our dark strange son is the bestest
I LOVE the purple eyeliner when Virgil gets excited!
Please tell me this is supposed to be pinxiety!!!! Btw this is amazing!
Alternatively Titled: Prinxiety the episode
them live commentating him spying was Great
OMGGGGG THIS IS AMAZING
Virgil's color changing eyeshadow at the end - I can't, it's too cute
“What now?” “The only logical next step: go home and regret everything”  THE BIGGEST MOOD
"And that's how I met your father kids, across the food court."
"I don't know what that was..." **places hand on shoulder** "Bravery..."  My Prinxiety Heart: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My Family: *o.O*
I love the detail in the end scene of Virgil's under eye shadow going from sparkly purple to black to purple to black depending on how anxious he was at any given moment
omg soo cute❤️!! and vrigils new eye shadow! and how it changes when he's happy/exited and when he's anxious!! great vid guys!!
This is so precious lol
I.  L O V E.  T H I S.  SOMUCHICANT-    Edit: ALSO WHY IS VIRGIL'S EYSHADOW SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH?????????????? I sense a change/tranformation is coming.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hxhixohdohfofhpcjpgupcj THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE EPISODE
This was literally the cutest thing I've ever seen oh my god ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Why are we not talking about Virgils purple eyeshadow???????????
I love the two parts of Thomas LITERALLY pulling him in different directions. Such an accurate representation of social anxiety.
IM LITERALLY CRYING OMG
This is GIVING me anxiety but its gay and art and I feed off it
If you remade this live it would be amazing!!!!!! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
I’m like— hours late to this and I’m salty, lmao! This was AMAZING tho!! I really enjoyed watching Virgil and Roman work together. When Thomas said that there would be someone who wasn’t in the last episode, I kept thinking about Virgil, Remus or a new side (theoretically the orange one; which people think it’s jealousy) and this was better than anything I ever imagined! There was some angst, which was kinda minor but it’s not like it can be avoided, and there was teamwork and love! It was amazing. Great work Thomas!! 💖
7:05 THOMAS IS THAT A JOHN MULANEY REFERENCE
imagine parts of your personality having a crush on other parts of your personality. couldn’t be me, too much self hate lmao
When I tell you I screamed from seeing this, *I screamed.*
I love Patton and this series
Thomas I would like you to know that this had a very Be More Chill vibe to it
Am I the only one who though Virgil’s eyeshadow looked purple...?    No..?  Just me..?   Ok..
AaaaaA yEeEES
The screaming at the end was absolute perfection
the purple eyeshadow to black eyeshadow-  does that mean post gay panic to just normal anxiety lol-
Virgil eyeshadow looks adorable!!! I love the purple it looks amazing on him!!
I have a few series 1st off why Virgil called Janus deceit One he doesn’t want to call him by his name or he doesn’t know the others know it yet second one why Virgils eyeshadow suddenly changed this is actually the first episode we’ve seen Virgil since he revealed he was a Darkside I think it’s the eyeshadow getting lighter is a representation of him slowly becoming more of a light side he just revealed he was a Darkside and now he’s turning into a full-fledged light side third one The reason why Janus didn’t show up when they kept shouting lies is because he’s with Patton He’s showing him around and stuff and he’s probably talking to Remus or the orange sideFourth one Roman and Virgil has started we hate Janus Club that’s why they call that his lies every time because they didn’t want him to appear
“We don’t even know if he’s gay” “You’re ignoring one key thing Thomas, we don’t know if he’s not gay.” Me with my straight (but mAyBe not) best friend
Virgil’s purple vs black makeup when he’s happy is so cool
“Oh I’m not...uh..stinky”     “LIaR”
Cant join patreon. Please dont stop on youtube
This is so cute and warm and soft. I need a live action version of this.. the interactions between virgil and roman is absolutely epic. Also the soft little "i dunno, plant?" Melted my heart
I LOVED THIS VIDEO!!
Virgil sitting on the bathroom counter is such a gay mood.
THIS WAS FUCKING CUTE
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
The reflections are sus- ;-;
THE HAPPY STIMMING  THE HAPPY STIMMING  THE HAPPY STIMMING  THE HAPPY STIMMING
Okay I don't know if I'm the only one who saw the end credit scene but I noticed Virgil's eye shadow turns bright purple when he's excited anxious and black when he's nervous anxious. Is that his more subtle way of showing his true feelings?!
Is no one gonna talk about how Virgil's eyeshadow changes when he's...less anxious? He shows more positive emotions and he's just being a pure boi.
Ok but Virgils eye shadow near the end kept changing depending on his mood. Was I the only one who noticed because i love it. Also the entire episode just made me so happy it was amazing. Great job!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This hit me on another level, especially with all the anxiety and stress that goes into talking to someone. Bravo

Can we please talk about the purple eyeshadow? Because I am LIVING for IT!! I  love happy Virgil
The MCR reference at 10:08 KILLED me--
I've never cried about an episode But this one 😭😭😭😭😭😭💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
The prinxiety stans are going wild
One thing that is in my mind after I saw this episode for the 4th time today:  VIRGIL. WITH DIFFERENT COLOR EYE BAGS. TURNED FROM A BLACK TO A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE. WHEN HE IS FREAKING HAPPY. AM I THE ONLY ONE? PLEASE TELL ME NOT, PLEASE
Omg omg omg omg
VIRGILS MAKEUP
_May I say, Virgil with the purple eyeshadow makes me so happy—_
OOOH THIS WAS SO GOOD I LOVED IT!!!!!
So cute 🥰
23:22 VIRGIL-
"What ARE You Doing?" "..Idk plant.."  *sobbing over cuteness and accuracy*
*sees nightmare before christmas*  *in unison* “Oh My  God”    I felt this on a personal level
Virgil’s purple eye shadow is everything!!
Are you two dating o w o
I definitely want to see the live action,  though the animatic was really neat.
Okay so.... ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW!!!

I'm socially awkward and i can relate this especially cuz i can't flirt to save my life
Whats this?! Two of my favorite youtubers colabing together?! This is a dream come true 😂
THE HAPPY STEMMING CAUSED MY HAPPY STEMMING IM DYING THIS WAS SO CUTE
Omg I literally screamed at the end well running through my living my room. My dog thinks I’m crazy now but GOD THAT WAS SO GOOD
OMG OMG HE’S BRAVE AHHHHHH also the purple eyeshadow is AMAZING does it have something to do if he’s feel positive or not?
These are always so well done, it's hard to remember this is the same person playing every character.
Absolutely loved this episode!!!
“We dont even know if he’s gay!” “But you are missing one key thing thomas! We dont know if he’s NOT gay!”   This is literally my multiple personalities arguing when we see a hot girl tbh
while he was doing the intro my screen froze and he was making this really awkward face
I low key want a pin that says pintrovert-
When your broke af 😭 but wanna help. But great video
love that Virgil's version of "starry-eyed" is iridescent eye shadow
I ship Roman x Virgil so hard!!!!
Did I spend a majority if this episode squealing in happiness? Maybe. But that's a secret I'll never tell !
Wait you get people to fall for ya in the bathroom.....
The eyeshadow! I Stan that
The artstyle is just ljkaskdfjajkdkmjkk
goooddddd i wish i had money for the patreon
Ok so reasons I need this in live action:  1. Roman and Virgil. 2. I NEED to see Thomas doing "gay eyes" cause the animation alone just make me scream. 3. How tf they all gonna fit in that trash can. 4. This speaks to my overwhelmingly to me socially anxious ass. 5. Virgil loves Thomas and Roman sooooo much 6.I'm crying!! 7. MORE VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW PLEASE!!!!! OMFG ... AND IT CHANGES COLOUR WITH HIS MINDSET!?! AAAAAAAAAA  Not to mention that the artists did just the most amazing job!!!!
I absolutely love every second of this video
i just finished watching and it’s safe to say that i’m crying so much...
This made me so happy!!!!!
THIS WAS SO ADORABLE I LOVE IT
This video was such an incredible reintroduction to the series! This just made me so happy and the artists are just SO talented!
Ok but petition to protect the guy in the bathroom. He was so adorable
OMG VIRGILS PURPLE EYE SHADOW IS SOMETHING I NEVER REALIZED I NEEDED IN LIFE!!!!!!
Like everyone I loved this episode and totally freaked out over the "entire shut up" lmao cause it was like so relatable in every way 😂😂😂 but whoever unliked this wholesome adorableness I say to you: WHAAAAT?!?!?!?!WHYYYY!?!?!?!?!?
Video: "Flirt or Flight" Advert: "ENTER THE WORLD OF HARRY POTTER"
First off: Kudos to the artists for drawing this, we fans thank you greatly. Secondly: Thank you Sanders and Co. for coming up with this brilliant episode (And yes I would love to see this in live-action!) Thirdly: I am forever using Pintrovert.  Fourthly: This was an amazing video. I am looking forward to more of the Sides, including Roman and Janus eventually talking about what happened at the end of Selfishness vs Selflessness Redux, where Roman made fun of Janus and all that happened after that.   Anyway, Love the new Deceit Shirt. *I shall be crying a bit while looking at my bank account.* I hope y'all have a great last few months of this year and a even better Year...well next year...sounded better in my head. Anyhoo, bye!
I loved this video so much! I reacted to it on my channel and it was amazing (here's my reaction btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA-TT2x1r78)
I didn't know pintrovert was a term.
This was such a cool episode. I wish I could help with the Patreon but I am very broke! lol
4:25 Dr. Maruki?
*plants to avoid talking to my crush*
OMG THERES NO ANGST?!!?!?! A LITTLE BUT NOT AS MUCH  THANK YOU JOAN AND THOMAS AND OTHER PEOPLE OR OTHER SIDES VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGED WITH HIS EMOTONS LIKEOMG  Imagine these people : '' Mommy why is this man talking to himself? " " SH KID its Thomas SANDERS!! " We have an answer for why Virgil wasnt in the earlier episode! Actually no
So anyways, who let you into half the worlds mental health?
Okay listen guys!!!!! I had a revelation. What if the last dark side is jealousy?!?!?! Huh???? HUH??????
I cant fucking breathe
Question- did you actually meet a guy or is this just what would happen in that situation?
This is just talking to my family and doing anything
I've never related to anything more
I love how in the end before shoving Thomas at Nico, Virgil isn't looking at Thomas. Instead, he's looking at Roman's expression and that's what ultimately caused him to make his decision
VIRGIL'S MAKEUP CHAGED WHEN HE WAS HAPPY OMG I LOVE IT
When I saw that this episode came out, I got so overexcited that I cried a little and almost passed out from hyperventilating.     It is now very very clear that I have an obsession. Help.      Also when I saw the thumbnail for this video I was just like  hahaha Prinxiety heart go *oop-*
*Out of all the food stands you creepily had to stalk from and be forced to pretend to order from...*  *it had to be carrots.*
OMG YES
The purple eyeshadow. Oh. My. Gosh. I loved and hated it.
“Thomas, I’m gonna need you to shake your hands. You gotta do *something* with ‘em. They’re just hanging there.”   FELT
I MISSED THIS
YAYYY YOU POSTED
this is so realistic to how flirting feels
You know how Roman said Janus’s name sounded like a librarian well......The Patreon name sounds like a super fancy library lol
This is what I needed today. This is the most relatable thing I've ever seen.
IM GONNA CRY OMFG
Virgil’s happy eyeshadow!
I can imagine all the cosplayers and all the emotes/gifs this video will have created  I will love every minute of it!!
Virgil: Thomas, I'm gonna need you to shake your hands.  Thomas: *stimming*  So, basically me throughout this whole episode XD
this is so cute
My dumb persona brain: Hey doesn't Nico look like Dr. Maruki?? Me: F*cK! Now I can't Unsee it!!!
NEW VIRGIL MAKEUP NEW VIRGIL MAKEUP NEW VIRGIL MAKEUP IM LOVE IM LOVE I AHHH
When Virgil was being slightly optimistic/ happy and that small detail with the purple glitter eyeliner 🥰 omg that was amazing  This episode was AMAZING!!!
wHy wAs tHiS sO hArD tO wAtCh? I fELt ThE aNxiEty tHrOuGh tHe gOdDaMn sCreEn.
I...LOVE...THIS
I bet the prinxiety shippers are going feral right now
Did you guys see virgils eyeshadow looked really purple in some parts of the video mainly when he was excited or happy you know like when Virgil is really anxious or they are in his room everyone got eyeshadow and then when he’s happy or Roman is in control  (cause he’s the romantic one) it goes purple
OKAY BUT THE GUY IN THE BATHROOM 🥺🥺🥺
At first it will be like roman just flirting with Virgil (as usual) but when u saw it I was like:he still flirting with him either way
Hi yes I would like to thank Virgil's sparkly purple eyeshadow for singlehandedly making my entire week
Wait what did he mean by sampler side?...im confused 👁️👄👁️
Nawww, my heart (and ooh, Patreon.... but I  poor... but I also wanna support him...)
I am living for the purple eyes shadow when Virgil goes full gay and I love it!
THE WAY VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW CHANGES WITH HIS MOOD KDJSJWIWOWBDJWJ
Yay
one time someone asked me for my number at the mall and this is really how it worked
Me currently crying over Roman and Virgil's character development also Thomas and Nico AHHH
Just wondering are there any Percy Jackson fans?      Because if u are, i squealed when that guy said his name was Nico because Nico
Am i the only person who noticed the eye shadow change back and forth from black to iridescent purple? (super cute idea)
I love the fact that Virgil’s makeup depending on his emotions gets brighter or darker either way purple
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VIRGILS MAKEUP. IT- IT WAS LIKE SHINY PURPLE-
Is it weird that the first thing that came to mind when I saw the title was literally flirting with the personification of social anxiety?
No1 talking about when virgil happy his eyeshadow goes purple
Seeing some of my favorite artists work with you was awesome 🥺
It looks like it
omg i was waiting for more stuff from you
I love Virgil’s happy eyeshadow! And his slight optimism!
Does Virgil have purple eye shadow on???
I’m so hung up on Virgil’s eyeshadow changing colour when he’s happy/excited it’s adorable!
Prinxiety supremacy? Prinxiety supremacy
THAT ZOOM IN ON VIRGIL AT THE END!!! MY HEART!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!    ...I'm fine, I promise.
Did anybody else notice when Virgil first walked in his eye shadow was purple but changed back to black!? But when he was upbeat it when back to purple
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE ROMAN HAPPY!
OMFG DOES THIS MEAN PRINXIETY IS REAL also i love how virgils eye shadow changes with his emotions just beautiful
Am I the only one that was thinking of prinxiety the whole time
Me: EeEeEhH My sis: whats wrong with you? Me: *PRINCXITIY* PANIC
Who else saw  when Virgil was happy his eyeshadow turned purple with glitter
Can we just talk about the fact that Thomas’ “friend” is voiced by Joan. Also I’m not sure but I think they also voiced Nico but I could be wrong.
I loved this video so much. I want to see it in love action so bad.
Theses videos make me really happy. And all of the other videos as well. I love ya'lls content.
So are we gonna ignore the fact that Thomas made himself animated again
“Wow, this introvert really likes talking about himself” -Roman
AWWWWW ITS SO SWEET
👏👏👏👏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That just made me happy
I just came home from a highschool placement test and saw this. Thanks Thomas keep up the great work!
I like how at the end Virgils eye makeup kept changing

Awww
Is no one going to talk about virgil's mood-ring makeup?!
Me: Everyone's gay until proven straight  My Creativity: UwU  My Anxiety: *Slaps me*
Soooooooooooo cute
This is such an accurate depiction of anxiety. Like, making a huge deal out of nothing. And having a crisis and questioning oneself over little things.
Hmmmmm I'm questioning virgils make up because when he's all happy his make up is purple but when he hated something or didn't like it, it will turn back to black
This very well might be my new favorite episode Thomas. This was absolutely incredible from start to finish and I'm honored to have joined your Patreon!! I can't wait to see how the story continues from here!!
When its just Virgil and Roman its amazing because it just bring out their similarities and differences. Its fun
“Mr. Flores” Me: *spits* MY MATH TEACHER?
SEEING VIRGIL HAPPY MAKES ME HAPPY
YEEEEEYYY NEW SANDERS SIDES VIDEO!!!!
As a pintrovert who wears merch to try to talk about myself without talking about myself/use as a conversation starter.....I feel called out 😅😂
VIRGIL WAS ACTUALLY SELFLESS AND ACTUALLY HELPFUL THIS TIME OMFG! THIS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!
I feel off my seat while watching this    I was that happy about this episode
Janus be so tired this episode and confused cause he just revealed his name  and he's already having a workout without intention😂😂😂 S E L F C A R E JANUS
I do NOT trust that angsty close up
That's so awesome that when Virgil is happy, his eyeshadow is sparkly purple. Also with the patreon, just take all my money. Though wouldn't it be cool if it was called Janus's Treasure Chamber?
I started crying
I'm seeing nothing on virgils under eyes. YALL IT TURNS  PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can see it change from black to purple a couple times as virgils mood and excitement changes.
As soon as I get a more favourable income, I’m joining your patreon - that’s for sure! But I’m currently spending every penny of my money on... you know... living... Or surviving to be more precise. But I will join you! ❤️❤️❤️ I really love your content, and I kid you not, my reactions to this video is the same kind of reactions I get when I see Hollywood movies. 😍 Totally immersed (is that correctly spelled?) in the story.
Why am I crying, this was SO GOOD!!! 😭👏🏼💕
19:40 is the most precious moment I’ve ever seen..           I’m not crying u are
I got a subway sandwich ad with Someone Sanders in it in the middle of the endcard  ;-; (I think it was Deion Sanders)
I started tearing up when the dude was walking awayyyyyyy ahhhhh i can barely see my screeeeeeeeennnnnnn so many typooossss that I had to fix while typing and waiting for the tears to recede ;-;  Edit: I have slapped my legs multiple times from secondhand embarrassment.  This is a good thing, it means it's relatable. XD
I found it cute when Roman put his hand on Virgil's shoulder and they looked at Thomas, like parents look at their child proudly.  Sorry if there are any mistakes.
Im so going to join the patreon once i get a job. I promise
No one's talking about Virgil with the purple eyeshadow at the end
this- this i probably my new favourite sander sides vid  •3•
I..... am so glad I sat down and watched this. It was so cute and funny, but even more than that it really strung some cords with a lot of stuff that’s been pertaining to my own life lately and I really really needed to hear and see these messages that this had to say. Beautiful little story Thomas
My smile did not leave my face once throughout this whole video. I needed this ❤❤
"You have used that argument on me far too many times."  I felt that.
I am obsessed with the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow keep changing according to when he is and is not anxious... THOMAS IS A GENIUS AND NO ONE CAN TELL OTHERWISE  •́  ‿ ,•̀
*I don’t know... plAnt?*
yo can somebody please explain this 5:06 part please? I'm confused lol
Don't mind me crying of joy
Prinxiety
"You're making a mistake" "If I am, I'll add it to the list" Roman bb noooo ;-;
Holy snacks, this is such an amazing work. Thank you very much to all the artists that participated in drawing this whole episode. Thank you writers for writing such an awesome episode. Thank you Thomas for bringing this kind of thing to us. This is so nice and cute I don't even know what to say anymore. Anyway, fascinating job. I'll try to look in opportunity to support you all on patreon.
PURPLE EYESHADOW VIRGIL!!!!! I LOVE IT💜🖤💜🖤  (every end. it changes purple and black.... i think(????))
also, Thomas, PLEASE show us that sweet little goggles boy, we need THE SHIPPPP-
Is Virgil’s eyeshadow changing from black to purple, is it just me?
This was so cute
when i saw the last part with roman and virgil i will like ":0 i have to watch this again again again and again I LOVE IT EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!"
Him: Nico Me" NICO D'ANGELO!?!??
Awwww Roman and Virgil I ship it so much sorry I just love it also the episode was amazing also I would have picked flight not flirt cause I can’t talk to people
I just started this, and wanted to make note of the fact I stopped another video to immediatley come here. Because any sort of Sanders upload not only demands but DESERVES my immdediate attention.
My otp My fricking OTP Prinxiety
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW IS FUCKING PURPLE INSTEAD OF BLACK?????? I LOVE THE TINY DETAILS
"But you can call me thomas if you wanna get ra-" *dont be shy, finish the sentence. dONT BE SHY--*

I watched this in the car with my family and I was fangirling and I think I scared them
I don’t know why but I cried to this. And it was beautiful
Aaaand my new favorite ship is Roman and Virgil
The pins are the perfect ice breaker tho! Just say you like them!
Is nobody gonna point out that Virgil had PURPLE EYE SHADOW
I was feeling attacked during this and then it went into a way I wish most of my encounters went at the end 😅.  This was just amazing, I hope we can get some more animatic stuff along side regular Sanders Sides
I screamed in agony way too many times during the whole video
When I saw Virgil's LIGHT PURPLE eyeshadow?!?!? SJSJSHSJSHSJSHHSHWJ- *I SCREECHED TOO MUCH AT 4AM IN THE MORNING-* lmaoo-
I died at 0:00
That eye shadowing swap
In your next Sander Sides can you do a rap battle with all the sides.  You don't have to if you don't want to.
thank each of you, guys, who worked on this, I love you, you made my day with this precious gay peace
I’m so happy!! This episode was amazing
Did he actually meet someone?
Okay okay okay Am I thinking to much or somethings going on important with virgils eyeshadow  It is was more purple when he was exiceted, I guess?? OR MAYBE ITS THE LİGHTİNG DONT MİND ME LOVES,, AMAZİNG VİDEO ONCE MORE!!! Im so happy my pins feels like that,, thats litearly why I have them,, Im an introvert so here is my interest list in a backpack pin form, please talk to me hehehehe
I’m writing this comment before watching: I am so happy!!!! I love Thomas SOOOOO MUCHH!
i made a hand sewn anxiety jacket with my birthday money but i my mom wont let me have social media so i cant post it
*SCREAMS IN GAY*
“If I am then I’ll add it to the list!” Not only bold, but also lowkey heartbreaking.
YOOOOOOOOOOO also I’m late :o(
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen

THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW
For a minute, I just want to send my appreciation to Thomas and Joan for producing this video even while there's the difficulty of a pandemic. Loved it, now please don't overwork yourself
*Nice*
Me " ha gayyy😏" Brother: "this is why moms gonna adopt you!"
I love how when Virgil was more happy sounding, he had purple eye shadow but when he was more anxious sounding he had black eye shadow In the end of the episode. I find it quite nice! ((idk if anyone commented on this yet I really don't wanna look through 11,000+ comments))
hold up... "i hate to rain on ur black parade, gerard gay" omfg roman u killed him

Theory: Virgil is also excitement side reason cuz excitement makes u move without thinking, and he made Thomas shake his hands like excitement also when ur excited it makes u want to walk it out and u think you need to see but you don't      Thomas if ur seeing this tell me if I'm right
GERARD GAY IM CRYING

I dont think I've ever aww-ed over a youtube video as hard as the "lets not waste this one" line made me. Rough day made instantly better by this video. Thank you Thomas and thank you to all the people that had a hand in making this.

Anyone else feel bad for bathroom guy? Esp if he saw Thomas and Nico, like, that would hurt
D-did Roman just make gay eyes at Virgil... an-and is Virgil’s excited eyeshadow sparkly purple??? I- imma cry. Such beautiful art from both Thomas and all the animators that made this possible
This was so cute and funny omg!!!! Amazing! The animation was so nice like, congraturations everyone!! And as usual i'm in awe of the writing, you put so much work into these videos and they're always funny and so, so clever. The dialogues just. Wow. Amazing job!!!!!!
This Whole thing is Just the explanation of  Gay Panic
They really needed Patton here
This is too cute.
PRINXIETY SHIPPERS, COME GET Y'ALL JUICE
So I've now watched the vid 2 times and this has been a emotional rollercoaster cried 5 times (happy AND sad) this was just breath taking jabsjabzkzbzjz  Edit: so third time (dont judge) I was so excited how did I miss all the music jokes I missed the blink lyrics I'm ashamed of my self I love my boy virg an emo mess a gerard gay (I didn't miss that one XD )
OH MY GODDDDDDDDD
The Purple Eyeshadow!!!!   And this just in  Thomas Sanders is the definition of a disaster gay
Omg virgils eyeshadow goes purple when he's happy! AGEND  YOU WHAJSTAK
15:41   Virgil never calls deceit Janus..... hmm.
I woke up to this?!! The purple eyeshadow?! The super cool castle on the table?! The fricking purple eyeshadow!!!!!!!
I had no idea about "ga eyes" ,but now that I know! I know!
Virgil: Its like cyberstalking.. but real life  Roman: so..... stalking..? Virgil: *Oh you're RIGHT-* -My last 2 braincells on a test in a  nutshell lmaoo-
I love the purple eyeshadow on Virgil. Nice switch up that kept appearing at the end
I'm only four minutes in and I can't stop laughing.
DID YOU SEE THAT DID YOU SEE THE HEARTS RIGHT THERE 19:58 AND THE BLUSH  I’m sorry the Princiety got to my head
PrinXiety MOMENT!!!!!
This is weirder if you think of how it plays in third person. Like the movement are the same but take out Roman and Virgil.
WHAT THE HELL THOMAS IM CRYING OVER FICTIONAL CHARACTERS!!!!!!! 🥺🥺🥺
WHEN VIRGIL IS REALLY HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE OH MY HEART
Did anyone notice that around the end Virgil’s eyeshadow was purple?
I can relate to this sketch so much! Flirting or even get to know new people with social anxiety is so freaking stressful!
Did anyone else see Virgil's eye shadow change. From purple to black. Purple when excited and black when put down or doubting himself?
That was awesome!!! Would love to see it irl!
That was adorable!!!
Prinxiety is strong in this one and I'm here for it.
This was so relatable, to the point of being physically painful.  WhY iS tHaT mY lIfE?!!!!!!!!
THOMAS PLEASE TELL ME YOU FINALLY HAVE A BOYFRIENDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT YASS
question: what would every sides Undertale soul trait. P.S. Hate is the black soul trait and it is added also i need canon answers.
Okay, not gonna lie. I saw the thumbnail and thought it was another comic or animatic of Sanders Sides from another channel. (Since I watch plenty of them, YouTube recommends them like hell.) I had to do a double take when I saw it was posted by Thomas, himself. XD
"I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" I want thus to be my senior quote
I just noticed that at the end Virgil's eyeshadow was changing color
Can't wait to see the live action one! Keep it up! 🥰😁
I suddenly want all the episodes to be animated 😿
This was such a sweet episode 💕
agahahahahaaaaaaa    C r y i n g    right now
THE END BIT WHERE VIRGIL AND ROMAN WERE KINDA SWEET N FLIRTY AND WOW PRINXIETY IS BIG SHIP
Wait... I'm I the only one who noticed Virgil's new eyeshadow.
All the love for the animators who did this video!! I love every aspect of it!! But... All the princxeity is crushing my Anxceit heart...
I NEED TO SEE GAY EYES IN REAL LIFE!!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
10:07 roman: no! i hate to rain your *black parade* gerard gay virgil: *grunts* roman: but the only thing left to do, is TALK TO THE GUY  roman stop attacking the emo's gdi
Because I cannot access patreon at this time of my life, I just want to tell you this Thomas, please make the live-action version of this when you can.
OMG THIS WAS PRECIOUS!!!! 💕
Wait, are we still going to get an episode after the pandemic addressing the last episode?
"What are you doing?" " *i dunno plant* "  I felt that deep in my soul  (10:45)
18:27  "You Can Call Me Nico If You'd Like!"  Me:...      NICO NICO NII-
The prinxiety fans are SCREAMING
Dude, Virgil's eyeshadow changes to purple when he gets excited! That is such an amazing and simple touch, I love it. :)
VIRGIL'S MAKEUP!!!!! AHHH IT'S SO GREAT!!!!!
Did anyone else notice that until Thomas came back down to Earth in the end bit Virgil's eye shadow was purple and sparkly?
Wait what if the orange side is one of Mekos sides??!?
Hey no sanders sides ships are going to work because as this new episode shows the sides crush on whoever Thomas crushes on
Cuute
I'm poor :(((
Theory: virgil’s eyeshadow is so bright bc he’s so happy and it’s like. Opposite anxiety. Excited. That’s the word I was looking for. And he’s stimming wjenenennenendnnensjsjsj
I SHIP IT! I SHIP IT!
the flipping eYESHADOW
I’ve been waiting forever for a new sanders sides video
I love how the more exited or happy Virgil gets the more purple and sparkly his eyeshadow gets.❤️
Virgils eyeshadow!!!!! Ahhhhhhh it’s so cute!
So the secret is to forget your food.....
Notice how Vigils eyeshadow was change constantly changing from black to purple.
Virgil: You're making a mistake!  Roman: If I am I'll add it to the list!   Fanders: Roman No!!
Okay idk what it was but Virgil's eyeshadow was purple at first and then switched to being black again, and then purple - was he blushing and so excited that it changed the color somehow? I mean he has shown to have other physical changes before, like getting a distorted and deeper voice when having an anxiety attack.
I'm bi
Did I just spend 25 to get a Janus shirt? Yes. Yes I did.
"Love is a key ingredient in all of the best recipes.... after salt" mOOD  edit: I thought the point of asides was that they weren't part of the main story???? Why is this one an aside if it is Necessary??  edit 2: so you namedropped deciet (15:47) but,,,, where is my snaky boi???? why hasn't he appeared???
I LOVE THIS ART HOLY CRAP-
Am I the only one that stans Thomas stimming? I mean, I know it's typically associated with neurodivergents, but it's cool to see neurptypical people do it too(seeing as it's a normal thing whether you're neurodivergent or not). It just makes me happy.
This made me cry at 4am.... I wish that'd happen to me too someday.. I'm not brave yet. But soon, I Could be. I've never focused on romance before during Highschool.  Only until college I had that longing for a significant other. I absolutely love this Thomas!! This made my heart swell so so much ❤️❤️❤️
I was just wanting this video for so long OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS :3
OH MY GODTHAT WAS THE CUTEST THING IVE EVER WATCHED (the same thing happened with me tryna talk to a girl lmao)
Haha never tell Virgil to relax. Only trick him to relax >:)
Happy Virgil has purple eye-shadow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HOW AM I LATE?! NOOO 😭😔
'I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay '  my new favourite line
I would like to formally apologize to my mum for the quiet screams and little squeals coming from my room.
19:39 I Know good and well Thomas did NOT just do that...  MY PRINXIETY HEARTTT😫
POV: you’re just a random person trying to shop in that mall while Thomas is diving into trash cans, being a gay disaster and talking to himself
10:58 damn that got me😭😭
You are old
I'm sorry but flirting with Social anxiety?   Virgils little freak out when he saw Roman looking sad???   This screams prinxiety    Also plz dont come at me for my ship, you guys can ship whatever you want!
SO CUTE I ADORE THIS SO MUCH!!
Wait first this and then an odd1sout vid (that I haven’t watched yet) yeah
I WANT TO SEE THE CONTEXT OF THE REMUS SMASHING THE PLATE ON HIS HEAD BTS SO BAD
When roman just kind of gave up i started cry so freaking hard and when virgle saw him and pushed Thomas I was screaming and crying all at once.
The artists deserve a award! Also also did you notice at the end that Virgil's eyes shadow changes between purple and black?
“He has stickers on his laptop..” *_”Pretty gay..”_*    *mood.*
My Patton is clapping 😊💖
thank you so much for this video, Thomas. I relate to it a lot, and its so nice to see anxiety represented in such a unique way.
Side note: Thomas is great at voice acting
19:38-19:58 my heart just melted i can't deal with this 🥺
Me : *sees Virgil's eyeshadow changing depending on his mood* My brain : *going crazy with possible theories for it* But also my brain : *too insecure to tell anyone about them*
This is so relatable! Thank you for this episode, the animation is the cuttest!
When Virgil isn't anxious his eye shadow turns PURPLE AND SPARKLY. I'm going to cry I love this series
Plot twist: *This is based off how Thomas met his new boyfriend*
Oh my gosh X3 Awwwww X3
AHHHG MY HEART
This made me so sooooo happy to watch, I was in the middle of binge watching the series in preparation to watch the new video when it came out then at beginning of “can lying be good?” I saw this in the recommended below and I got so ding dang darn excited!!  Edit: I just realized the dude in the bathroom stall heard Thomas talking to himself...
Who else misses his vines?
Yeah. Talking to guys I think are cute usually ends up with me making a straight guy friend or just stammering over my words and walking away redder than a tomato
SO. MUCH. JOY. omg i needed this
THREE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS, ONE OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS(who is also also an artist), ONE AMAZING ANIMATIC AND VIRGIL AND ROMAN BEING WHOLESOME???!!! THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER YEEEEEES
IM SORRY BUT WHY WAS THAT THE CUTEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
"You can't use info you found by snooping. That's like cyberstalking, but real life."  "So.... stalking."  *long pause* _"Oh you're RIGHT"_
Due I would contribute to the patreon if I could but I don't have a job and I'm a college student. 🙃 Someday. I promise!
Nothing but a bruised ego  ...hmm

This is so cute
Just joined the Patreon! I'm so excited for all the extras! Thomas, you're my first patreon membership.
Virgil's eyeshadow: 🦄🦇🦄🦄🦇🦄🦄🦄🦇🦇🦄🦇🦇🦇
Virgil’s new eyeshadow is STUNNING Edit: wait I just realized it changes to reflect his feelings it goes full black again when he starts getting more anxious that’s so cool.
Ooo, Thomas~ You've finally found a manz!!
Thomas: patreon(?)  Me: too bad i'm poor ;-;
Im only 8 minutes in and my anxiety has started up from this- yet im so curious about what happens next i keep turning my phone off taking a breath before comming back-
Yaaaasssss he's back the king is back
Was Virgil wearing sparkling purple eyeshadow when he was all flustered/happy.        cute :)
this is basically making prinxiety canon and I'M GONNA SCREAM YEEEEES!!
I needed this in my life, thank you !!!!❤❤😍😍
AAOAOOAO THOMAS OUT HERE GIVING US SOME AMAZING CONTENT <333
awww the end looked like prinxiety :3 i love the animation its cuteee
That was so AMAZING! I loved it! You did so well Thomas! Keep up the great work!
22:50 the _SMILE_ 🥺🥺🥺❤♥️💜💜❤💜♥️♥️💜💜❤💜♥️ This is all I've ever wanted in life I'm so serious
I like Vergils upgrade in eyeshadow   OK and then when he gets excited it turns back to purple until he gets anxious again?
This whole video was just the  “heh I DO THAT” vine
10:09  👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Virgils eyeshadow changes color based on his mood. When hes happy/excited/not anxious its purple-ish, but when he gets anxious it gets black
Omg it’s here
I want to cry so hard right now ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜😭😭
All I could say during this whole episode was  “DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN”
An amazing video as always🥰🥰
"try speaking from the heart" Me: hahha **silently starts to sob** n-nice one *R-RoMaN*
The art style is literally so adorable!!! 🥰
ITS BEAUTIFUL AND ILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING MORE WHOLESOME I SWEAR I THOUGHT VIRGIL AND ROMAN WERE GONNA HUG OR SOMETHING
" you are going to have to try speaking from the heart..." * Disney ad plays *
I AM CRYING THIS IS SO DARN CUTE, IM NOT EVEN JOKING IM ACTUALLY CRYING
GET U A MAN WHO LOOKS AT YOU THE WAY VIRGIL LOOKS AT ROMAN AT 19:56
One thing . Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
**gay panic**
17:18 Virgil Virgil Virgil Virgil I was just squealing the entire episode. This was amazing.
OML that was so sweet aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!! the art was so good tooo!! ;v;
His eye shadow keeps changing💖  It’s because of his emotions right?💕
This was so cute and the animation was great!
Awe, Virgil's eyeshadow is somehow connected to his emotions. Its kind of adorable.
Quick theory: virgils eyeshadow was a lighter purple colour as oppose to his normal black because he was feeling a positive emotion. So what if as he feels more positive emotions and has more and more of a positive influence on Thomas that he becomes more of a lightside, resulting in changes to his appearance and personality. This could also explain why is has become less sassy and snarky since being accepted, as that was the real beginning of him being a lightside
That was the cutest animation I've ever seen. I'm literally crying🥺😭
ive been reflecting about this message for 3 hours straight      I mean 3 hours gay
MY PRINXIETY SENSES WENT INSANE ON THIS ONE WEEEEEWOOOOO WEEEEEWOOOOOO
So... When Virgil is optimistic... His eyeshadow changes to a light purple...? Huh... Next we see Janus' scales turn into a disco ball when he's not lying
I’ve been waiting for this episode for so long and it was totally worth it! Props to the artists for drawing this entire thing! I know from experience how time consuming and hard it is to make an animatic and I’ve never made anything longer than ten minutes.
I didn't know "gay eyes" exist Probably since I'm an extreme introvert Edit: it's not a joke it's just sad tbh
Rated R+ Me: *InTeReStiNg* I love this episode- "Uh, I'm not hungry" "LiAR-" Mood- Wait, why is Roman pointing out every time he lie- *realization* HOLY HEPHAESTUS HE'S STILL MAD AT JANUS- "For a pessimist I'm pretty optimistic"  I stan Roman making old jokes throughout this video is my livelihood- "When it comes to anti-social etiquette, I'm like a triple expert"  That's a mood  GERARD GAY MY LIFE IS COMPLETE- Adding more mistakes to the list..? Roman, are you okay...?- THE STRANGER IS VOICED BY JOAN XDDDD "That's like cyber stalking, but in real life" "So.....stalking?" "..OH MY GOSH YOU'RE RIGHT-" I stan This got angsty really quick. Also, Virgil isn't calling Janus by his name, does he not know...? Prinxiety shippers are thriving- I WISH I HAD MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY- VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW???? I LOVE IT! I stan Virgil's purple eyeshadow, but I noticed when he started thinking negatively it turned back to black, has that been the case for the whole season...? I doubt it, but Virgil calling the dog a demon is funny-
This whole video started from a gay panic
This art style is literally the cutest thing ever
I loved this episode so much it is soo fun and heart wrenching. And the fact the Virgils eyeshadow changes colour when he’s like nervously excited/ happy is such an amazing detail I didn’t expect. Thomas, The animators, and everyone else involved did such an amazing job and can’t wait for what’s next to come. 😊😊😊🥰🥰🥰
"Did you not flush?" "I didnt want to ruin the moment"  Yo bathroom stranger guy is baby and I want to hear more about that guy
I aspire to be a pintrovert
AFOEWAUHVS VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW I AM DECEASED
I screeched when I saw this pop up! Love your vids. Gonna edit to add my reaction to the thing as a whole. Lolz.  Edit: I was probably convincing my family that I am insane because I squealed a LOT during this video. It was like, "FINALLY! SOMEONE GETS HOW IT FEELS!!" I have horrible horrible anxiety and these videos really help me tone it down. In fact it inspired me to finally get the help I need. So thanks Thomas!!
This is right brain, left brain all over again-
Whenever I saw Niko I thought Maruki from persona 5 royal
dr maruki???
Me after watching the episode:.....that was beautiful  My brain: Let's watch it again  Me: oh yeah definitely!
14:18 I’m waiting for someone to walk out of one of the stalls-  Edit: OMG IT JUST HAPPENED-  Edit 2: PRINXIETY IS SHINING RN Edit 3: THE EYESHADOW CHANGED :O
1. Prinxiety shippers are quaking 2. I DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR THAT GOSH DARN PATREON AND I'M ABOUT TO CRY
No man! No, its ROman. With an R.
Ok listen up THIS IS A WORK OF ART it's Beautiful !!!!!!
PRINXIETY IS SAILING!!!!!!!!
I love you and your videos thomas! You always make my day! Hope you stay safe and happy!
Omg! That was adorable!!!
This was amazing!!! Such an awsome job. Thank you!! I missed Virgil so much in the last episode...! I'm sqealing internally-  I have a question - will the live-action version only be released on Patreon, or are you planning to also at some point release it here on YouTube for those who can't afford to donate right now...?
HESFLFFKSKLNLK HIM P O R B L E  E Y E S
Best 24 minutes of my life
Oh my god, watching this felt like looking into a mirror. I love it, I'm so happy that this exists!
This is so beautiful holy shi-
It's my birthday today and when I saw this I was like "can this count as a birthday gift?"
O MA GAWD  THE PRINXIETY!!!!!        GAAAAAAAAAAH💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️
Roman and Virgil getting along with eachother is an analogy for thomas finally feeling content and not freaking out anymore. Thoughts?
WHATCH THE OWL HOUSE ITS COMING OWN ON Disney plus  ON THE 30TH
I feel as though if I can learn to imagine my emotions and feelings as characters, it could be easier to make decisions like this. The amount of people that I want to take a shot with or approach is so many and all I do is sit there in awe and then shut down my thoughts of them having interests in me
The level of anxiety this video gave me, far too much 😅😅😅😅
This entire video: squeaky feet
Anyone else notice that Roman becomes confused when other people use nicknames for him? He rarely uses anyone's name preferring nicknames but whenever someone else uses a nickname for him becomes confused. He accepts Roman or Princey but anything else... He also does this in Accepting Anxiety. Thomas says "you're the boss, hoss." He responds with "My name isn't hoss, it's Prince Roman." It's almost like how literal minded Logan is and I want to see them bond over this now.
OMG A NEW EPISODEBDJEJDUEO    Edit: I JUST FINISHED IT DJDJDJRUFUEKRJRHJEUDHRKOS
Nico: “and it just keeps pilling and pilling until it inevitably spills out”  Thomas:....you saw me knock over that trash can didn’t you  Nico: *THAT WAS YOU!?*
New... eye shadow? New eye shadow!  NEW EYE SHADOW!! IT'S PURPLE!!
I'm still amazed how Thomas can have the same voice for all the characters but have such a different voice....
Oh my god that was so cute I can’t. It was so relatable I wanna cryyyyyy
catch me crying at all of this, it is so beautiful
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH- The artists did such a good job!
EVERYONE TAKE COVER THEY'RE BACK.....          THE PRINXIETY SHIPPERS
I love that Virgil's eyeshadow changes shade depending on his level of anxiety. Muah, Chef's kiss
I loved that video ! It was cute, it was beautiful, pretty, wonderful, heartwarming. Made me tear a bit.
" we can live like Jack and Sally"!?!?! Did they just!?!?!? I DIED!!!!!
Guys...this is the first Sanders Sides where they really get to interact with each other, and I love it so much!!
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VIRGILS MAKE UP AND HOW IT CHANGES WITH HIS EMOTIONS?! BECAUSE THATS GENIUS, APPLAUSE TO THE TEAM FOR THAT!
Are we not gonna talk about the little hearts when Roman said shut up emo omggg
I love this so much! This actually made me cry at one point😭😭😭
This whole episode in a nutshell: *gay panic*
I'm screaming!
Can we talk about the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow changes depending on his mood!!! I love that so much and the purple is so good on him fhasfh
Virgil with purple eyeshadow now has my heart💜
WATCH THE OWL HOUSE
The gerard gay joke made wheeze so hard
Oh god how i have been waiting
2 funny parts I would like to say but one is adorable!  Roman:shut up! Virgil:Shut up? Roman: SHUT UP! Adorable love to see Virgil joining in.  Roman:Shut up emo. So cute! He's really getting ready for loads of theories isn't he? That's just a theory. A game theory. Prinxiety is starting to form and I love it!  Edit #1: Please bring back Virgils hoodie. I rlly want another hoodie for my collection and I don't have the skill and talent to make it like some other people. I love it way to much and it is just so flipping amazing!  Edit #2: OMG I have never had 36 likes before! Thank you for liking my humor and thoughts! This is more then I'll ever get on a Yt vid I make! Thank you all!
HAPPY FLAPS!!!!!!! I DO THAT!!!!!!!!!
I wish I could join😕😕😕😕
This is my favorite episode so far! The art! The story! The dialogue! *Virgil's eyeshadow changes color when he gets flustered/excited!*
If I have pins and stuff on my bag or whatever it is literally "HI I LIKE THESE THINGS IF YOU ALSO LIKE THESE THINGS PLEASE COME TALK TO ME ABOUT THESE THINGS!!!!!"
The Prinxiety in this episode though-
Vrigil:No Roman:NO YOU NO,I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay Me:*wheezing*
This video has made my day, missed the sander sides stories 😊
"Gerard Gay" is sending me, I audibly snorted
"I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking"  I mean-
OMG PURPLE GLITTERY EYESHADOW!? FOR VIRGIL WHEN HAPPY!? UUUUHHHH YEEEESSSS?
AHH OMG🥺
Was the stranger Thomas tried to say was his friend from kindergarten Joan?
The slow zoom on Virgil at the end: My heart!! Also: Get out demon!  xD
1. Virgil in purple eyeshadow 💝 💖💕 2. Roman: (puts hand on Virgil’s shoulder) ........’Shut up, emo.’ _It was at this moment that eardrums around the globe shattered due to the screeches of happiness that sounded from the world’s Prinxiety shippers_ Edit: Don’t mind me just gonna rewatch the end card for the literal 15th time
I want that Janus shirt so bad but I'm such a poor college student so...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Any chance it's going to be a normal product in the future?  EDIT: I just realized. This is the first legit time we've seen Virgil in almost a year....        Side note: It bugs me to no end that it says Janus' when it should be Janus's
Are you going to update the amount of pledges the 125 and 100 ones can have? I want to do those but they're sold out :/
I literally cried because I couldn't join patreon... I'm so sorry Thomas!
AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, SPECTACULAR, AWESOMEE!!
Aaah this is the cutest.thing ever!!
"he has some stickers on his laptop." "pretty gaaaay."  ROMAN. I DONT APPRECIATE THIS CALLOUT.
Not to take away from the discussion but is it weird that I'm a religious person who doesn't have a problem with homosexuality? I mean, I don't think it's weird but I like to see what people think. I just believe love is love and in the end God or whatever you believe in doesn't have a problem with it. Kinda nervous putting this out there lol but this is a great and tolerant community from what I've seen.
My serotonin levels seeing Thomas posted: ↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️
Nobody: Me when Thomas finally uploads again: *Y e s , i a m s p e e d !*
No one’s gonna talk about Roman and Virgil saying liar to Thomas?  Like the perfume and the bathroom?
VIRGIL TELLING THOMAS TO SHAKE HIS HANDS OMG THE SUBTLY TRANSITION VIRGIL IS HAVING AND THE WAY THOMAS IS DOING IT ajenfjsjbzBbsbwhdjJWBEHE
Ok ok, everyone talking about Roman and Virgil in the episode. But why is none talking about "Deceit" being indirectly there?
My last brain cell @ me: *Virgil voice* I'm gonna need you to shake your own and hands
Roman: I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay! Me: I CAN'T EVEN! *Hearing Joan reject Thomas* Me: YoU hAvE OfFiCiAlLy MaDe Me LoOsE mY mArBlEs!!!!!!
11:47 Did you guys know that Captain Blunderpants is an actual character in the series? He's the evil counterpart of CU from another dimension.
My face hurts from smiling holy crap this was such a cute video🥺
I love the art style, I love the plot, I love the jokes, I love everything about this episode
OMG this is amazing ! ❤
I just loved it <3
Man, Thomas is really just feeding the prinxiety fire without knowing now isn’t he smh 😔
This made me cry... why did this make me cry?!😭
I love this!!!
These videos make me so happy and now virgil's got purple eyeshadow the don't tell me too relax at the end is just yes i love the asides episodes
I've been waiting for ever!!!!!!!
I gotta day.... Gerard Gay got to me 😂
The first seven minutes I've just been screaming "Oh my god! You guys are making it worse! Just let him do his thing! You're like judgy helicopter parents!" My brain does this a lot with me too
I love when I can tell who is talking, I knew when John was talking😍😍😊😊  I'm actually crying, I felt it deep down.  THAT MAKE UP VIRGIL!!! HE WAS BLUSHING!!
So, Virgil has purple eyeshadow when he’s happy!!!!
Virgil has PURPLE EYESHADOW
Y'all can catch me crying in the club ;w; This was beautiful and the artists did an amazing job :>
WHAT. God this was so GOOD. I loved Nicos voice actor, he was so fun to listen to, and the delivery do some of Thomas' line felt like they were tailored specifically to smack me right upside the feels. And the ARTISTS did such a good job, especially with the EXPRESSIONS god I just couldnt get enough, I rewatched some scenes like 5 times in a row. Its not a true Sanders Sides episode unless it takes me twice as long as the runtime to watch it.
I will cry if there is not a live/non cartoon version of this someday. This was brilliant! Thank you for providing a dose of Good Feels today! 🤗🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤
My anxiety is super triggered, i am dying
Why did I just cry. Oh my gooddddd
IM LITERALLY CRYING STOP
Love the animation! So cute!
Virgil telling Thomas to literally get up and do something or like to just move his arms and hands to relieve nervous tension is so relatable. I do that wayyyy to often-
at least with this they can have the video take place in other locations besides his house(Not that there was anything wrong with the House)
I’m not even past the start but I already love it
ᵗʰᵃᵗ ʷᵃˢ AMAZING💕🏳️‍🌈
I follow ABDillustrates and love his work and personality!
Gonna be honest with you Thomas. I needed this video more than I can put into words. Things have been bleak and this video cut through the darkness like a blade made of sunlight.
VERGIL'S EYESHADOW GETS SPARKLY AND PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg-- I'm a multishipper and I perfer Logince but this episode brought the prinxiety shipper out of me
PRINXIETY IS REAL!
ahahahaha ohhh my gosh I'm cackling pffff Thomathy this is adorable
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH THOMAS
I've never seen Virgil so happy, and it makes me happy
*cries in seeing this late*
at 2:42 when Thomas is running away you can see tears forming in his eyes and that's relatable and very depressing-
I love this!! My heart ❤. Everyone who participated on this video did an amazing job, including the artists!!! Great video!
Ahhh this is amzing I love the art 😍😊
I can’t get over Virgil’s purple eye shadow that’s applied every time he’s happy. I’ve never seen him smile so much. This video is just the cutest thing ever and everyone who work on it is incredible!!!
So good!!!
Anyone else noticed that when Virgil is happy his eye shadow is shimmer purple and when he is normal it turns back to black
“Don’t tell me to relax” 😂 favorite line
Here's a question do you spell it as Nico or Niko cause I spell it as Niko is that ok
THE END WAS SO FLUFFING ADORABLE OMG :0
First of all last part of the animation was adorable second of all Virgil and Roman are better friends in this! And third of all Virgil got braver because Roman and Thomas were sad-
Roman and Virgil do that stuff at the end and how are we supposed to not think they are in love T^T
4th time watching this B)
VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!! OMG MY HEART 💜
Roman and virgil❤️😂
AHHHHHHHHH THIS IS SOOOO FLIPPING ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!
This is hitting to close I don’t like this
the animatics were gorgeous!! And the story was wonderful as always <3 It was nice seeing Virgil and Roman interact like that. I'm very curious to where the series will go next!! I wish I could be part of the patreon, but I am still a minor and I don't have my own money yet (also, an US dollar costs like 100 pesos, sadly) but I hope I can start contributing someday! Love you, guys! I love what you do!
Thomas is gay?! Epic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DUUUUUUUUDE DUDE DUDE DUDE
This episode just made me so happy. I love it 🥰
Believe it or not, I had either a dream or a vision about this kind of video, except there were some differences-  (Also, my mom wanted me to see a bag that another guy had because she thinks it can be added to her collection, so pretend to go get some another bag just to get a look. I know how you feel -w-)  And does anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow color keep changing?!
Anybody else get massive prinxiety vibes here
Didn't you mention in your "Dark Side of Disney" video that you despized carrots?
10:44  "What are you doing???" "Uhh, I dunno.... plant?????" LMAO WHY DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING I'D SAY-
some things in this episode that i will never get over: -thomas’s monologue -roman and virgils relationship -roman and virgils character development  -how amazing the animation is -how funny virgil was -how relatable thomas and roman are when seeing a cute guy -virgils eyeshadow -the demon dog -the nightmare before christmas references (with the sticker and blink 182)  all in all i freaking loved this episode. thank you to thomas and the team for making this amazing!
Instead of rona my first thought was depression naps.
I was gonna comment something then I realized that it would come off as rude so instead I'll comment something else. Loved the video! I really liked the art style too!
Aaaaaaaa okayokayokay. So like I'm curious what the purple eyeshadow means. If it means like excited nerves like a good kind of anxiety... Like I just... So many questions.
!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im so giddy wtfff aaahh
I loved this episode!! Also omg can someone explain the ending clip when Virgil looked at Roman when he said "of course we're ready." Was that indicating that he was also experiencing feelings for Roman?
Okay but- this is so wholesome-???🙈💕💕  And can I just say, Prinxiety was just THERE😭❤
I cried. I don't cry often. But I just did.          THE PRINXIETY SHIPPER WITHIN ME IS SCREAMIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!!!!!!
_sigh_ 😔 Much as I loved the episode, I find it sad to see another dose of classism in a previously safe space. "You're not rich enough to get the _bonus_ content, which we made some available for free before. You don't deserve to see it if you can't afford to throw monthly cash our way!" 😔 I'm sure they don't mean it that way, but that's how it feels these days. Guess I'll just enjoy the music from outside.
At the end when they were screaming i was so happy  This episode was so cute 🥺💕😁😁😁
DO I SENSE A LITTLE PRINXIETY!?!?!?  *screaming in fanboy* I am so sorry-  Also amazing animation and video!
do i smell vigrilX roman mabyeeee...
Thomas seriously ships prinxiety, there’s no convincing me otherwise
YES FINALLY
Oh, the Gay Panic™ in this episode gives me life.  ....mainly because I've been in this type of situation before and well, yeah you get the picture. 😅 Social anxiety ruins my life and I haaate it.
The fact I got so happy I started crying, I love this video sm. I'm soooo happy :)))
Awwwwe
That was so cute!!! 🥰😊🏳️‍🌈
17:16 Virgil wanted Roman to be happy he put his anxiety to the side (no pun intended) and pushed Thomas. This is so wholesome
I HATE YO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY
AAAAAA ITS OUTTTTT New Title: *Thomas in a cartoon being gay for 24 minutes-* Also why is this making me so sensitive- (the end prinxiety comes true- 🥺)
ooh my goodness ohh my goodness oohhhhh that was amazing!!
I'm not crying - you're crying! But seriously, I thought this wouldn't be fun but I was SO wrong. Laughed and had all the feels. No matter what medium you and your creative team use, it's always the Sanders Sides we love. Thank you!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (I have nothing else to say but I love everyone that made this and that this was amazing Thomas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Their so freaking happy it's adorable 🥺
After 3 years we finally have someone to ship Thomas with
Thomas: “And I know, that if I don’t act on these feelings right now, I’m going to regret it”  Virgil: Looks around surprised and cautiously in Romans direction  Me: *Hmmm, yes I see..*
Don’t worry all the dislikes were from people who were crying too much that they missed the like button
So CUTE!!!
alsjdkdisbdjdjs i never have notifications on so I’m late!!!!! kill me now- (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
It’s giving me anxiety to see we’re this goes and I’m only at 5:29–
virgil happy? shiny eyes?? ACTUALLY EXITED FOR THIS GUY?? OOHH MY HEAAAART
ADORABLE CARTOONS I LOVE IT WELL DONE
I am living for virgil with purple eyeshadow!💜💜💜
Aww so sweet
I'm totally Virgil in day-to-day situations.
Aww you two look like Michael and Jeremy from bmc
You trying to say something Thomas??👀👀👀👀👀👀 do you have a special someone? 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Y E S
I love seeing virgil so happy at the end ♡ also their like teenage girls talking about their crush and I love it XD
the amount of stress I felt through this thing is a s t r o n o m i c a l
I wanted to see Patton in a skirt this video XD I’m sorry lmaoooo, but I did love this. Especially Virgil, he’s trying mannnn. Also totally didn’t ship Princexeity- aHeM.
I am watching this video for an hour now, because I fangirl, scream, laugh and pause the video per 5 seconds 🤣
Petition to add Remus and Janus to the intro
I love Virgil explaining the introvert talking methods. Because I have a ton of pins and stickers on my laptop and favorite bag. Ahhh noo I just got to the part where Roman went ‘I’ll add it to the list’ for the mistake part. Also I love how this turned out all the artists did really well!
Honestly this gave me Welcome to Night Vale vibes with the tone of the romance and Nico's voice
“Uuuuhhhh I don’t know...plant”
Also another thing that needed is OWN comment, Virgil panicking and pushing Thomas at Nico I think his name was? I SCREAMED he took a step forward when we probably never thought he would! Our Emo boy is getting braver!!
Ok so does the end card confirm prinxiety???? I need info!
I took this title to mean Thomas flirting with the concept of social anxiety but I’m still not disappointed lmao
THE PRINXIETY IN THIS- HOLY _SCHIST_- I NEVER KNEW HOW MUCH I NEEDED THIS UNTIL NOW-
I laughed so hard at 14:25 The moment i saw the guy come out the bathroom stall, I just burst into laughter 😂
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard gay"  Oh my god! I'm dying  lol
This was so freaking adorable!!!! :)
Virgil had purple eyeshadow when he's happy/excited??????????? My HEART???????
"Did he not flush?" "Did you not flush?!"  ".....I didnt want to ruin the moment."
Oh my gosh, I can relate to the hand flapping at the end, I do that when I get nervous or excited or both, I do it as a stimmimg mechanism
Why else is rewatching this for the rest of the day?
What are you doing? *idk. plants.*
AAAAAAAAAAAAA I’m freaking out! I just love this!
Don’t worry we understand why and we hope that you stay safe.
Why is the comment section filled with romance-obsessed people. It's not that big of a deal! -One Aromantic.
✨SEROTONIN✨
No one can deny that this episode was full of prinxiety fuel. Platonic or not it's still full of prinxiety.
*cries in big broke*
This is beautiful 😍
“LIAR”  Hold on- JANUS?—  Seriously- I think Janus had to have helped with this video or something
THAT.WAS.AMAZING !!!!!!!
Omg! Virgil's purple eyeshadow!
THATS SO CUTE JSAJHAVAHAUSVAJAKLW
I LOVE TALKING ABOUT THE INTROVERTED METHOD OF TALKING THROUGH PINS AND STICKERS because I explain to people why I get fandom shirts and my computer is covered in stickers so that people know what I like and we can talk about it AND NO ONE GETS ME. But anyways, I'm also mega obsessed with this video because I love love love the animation style!!! It's so cute and matches Thomas so well honestly. It's also amazing and such a smart way to get the video done during a pandemic! For the actual content of the video, YES. Oh the panic from Virgil was so real, I FELT THAT. And the expressions were so perfect! I honestly think this worked extremely well as an animatic, especially with the part where they're spying on the guy (pin, basketball, gay, no--gay, wait GAY). The jokes and humor mixed with all the serious talk was excellent. Then end talk with ~Mr. Flores~ was so wholesome and cliche haha but THE ENDING I FELT PANIC WE DON'T QUESTION IF WE'RE READY THAT JUST LEADS TO PANIC AND ONLY PANIC. I'm all about this tho. I can't believe this was an Aside and not a Sides video?? It's such quality???  Thank you so much Thomas!! Heading to Patreon now :))
my brain: ehoh~zipituplark
Thomas, I really wish I could pay the 25. I'm nervous that it will sell out by the time I gain enough for the first payment.
When he was talking about Janus and said "is that fair to him?" IM SCREAMING, HE CARES ABOUT HIM  and can we talk about how virgils eyeshadow in the end changed colors according to whether he was neutral of more anxious than normal? And the neutral look was really shiny and vibrant, indicating that he was happy, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SO MUCH-
is... is this a true story?
that moment at the end of the animatic when roman and virgil had a moment. best part of the episode!!!
THIS EPUSODE IS SO GOOD
💙Yes, this was worth the wait. V's eye shadow was changing, it was just perfect.
THAT WAS SO CUtE aAaAAaAaaa
This video really said prinxiety rights, huh?
Ya i love you so much you are amazing!!!!!!!!
I came here from Alex's channel and i am now a fan of Sander Sides officially☺. I hope he has more animated content. Thank you Thomas
Me: Oh frick all the prinxiety shippers are screaming with joy *scremas of joy in the background* Me: SHUT UP
Tag yourself, I'm Thomas looking at the plants and saying, "I don't know, plants"
Am I the only one that desperately wants to see the gay eyes in non cartoon form? Like, I am so invested in how you make a >:3 face in real life
Does this mean Thomas has a boyfriend???
AW THIS IS ADORABLE
In the end- was it just me or was virgil’s eyeshadow changing colors?!
10:07
Cant wait for the closed captions!
I got really scared because so many people were saying that Princxiety had been confirmed cannon in this episode. The ship actually is a massive trigger for me, it reminds me of toxic relationships in the past and it’s honestly abusive in truth. The past their actions were not very nice to each other and it’s just not gonna work out. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but it’s really scary to see the behaviors that are subtly abusive if these two were “in love”.   Sorry for the pity parade, it’s just...... I’m scared.      Also Janus and Remus love please.
If i had these things in my head talking to me about things i should do i would just tell them to chill thr f*ck out and talk to me when they understand whos in charge of the body and learn to respect my choices or they can f*ck off
Today I Just turned 19, BTW Great Episode!! 😄😄 I totally liked it. 👍
oh my god the virgil and roman interactions are top notch this episode tysm for the gift thomas
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW CHANGING BACK TO BLACK WHEN VIRGE GETS MORE ANXIOUS KSKEJGODHSK BBBBBRRRUUUHHHH
A big thank you to the artists you brought this to life amazingly.  And the voice actors.  I would focus on the plot but that is wrong I want to focus on how hard you worked and how well you did.
OMGGGGG I LOVE THISSSSS FAVORITE EP
When it has 73 dislikes you know it’s good
Wait...did Virgil say "i can't believe we text each other now a days?"  T H E Y A R E B E S T F R I E N D S
*virgil and roman make eye contact*  when i tell you i RAN to get my sketchbook
*loving that purple eye shadow Virge*
*ive never related so much to something*
this episode is literally just gay panic.
The hearts from Roman at Virgil— did Prinxiety just become canon? Did that just happen? Oh my freaking goodness
OH MY GOSH! THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE EPISODE I'VE BEEN TRYING NOT TO JUST SCREAM- THIS EPISODE IS AMAZING, THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED WITH THIS ARE AMAZING, IT'S ALL JUST AMAZING- AAA-
Wait, He still uploads? OH MAMA, THE KING IS BACK IN MY RECOMMENDATIONS, WAHOOOOOO BABY
Did we just get a giant Prinxiety scene or am I imagining things.
ROMANNNNNNN
I felt both sides of this situation!! The animation was amazing!! And I'm so SO HAPPY THEY HELPED MAKE THE VIDEO POSSIBLE!! And I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! I love how Roman and Virgil relationship has grown!! And the detail with Virgil's eyeshadow going from purple then to black when doubting?! Love LOVE IT!!
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS IM LOSING IT
I'm not crying because I can't buy anything YOU'RE CRYING BECAUSE I-I...I MEAN YOU CAN'T BUY ANYTHING
Oh my goshhhh aaaa that was worth the wait!!!! (And I know everyone has already said it but eyeshadow???)
Putting others first:moceit  Flirting with social anxiety: prinxiety I am kind of terrified of the next episode ngl
15:28 "But you can't have true love if the relationship isn't built on truth." Wowww some really raw lines from Roman here
I DIDNT GET THE NOTIFICATION I AM SO MAD AT YOUTUBE AAA
PURPLE EYESHADOW I REPEAT PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!!
The fact Roman made an emo joke while making a theatre reference made me unnecessarily happy
This video was literally just me screaming at the tv while procrastinating on school work
I'm sorry but that "TOP A'TA MORNING TO YAH!" just made me so happy T^T
In the end the virgil makeup change from purple to black two times
I was fangirling the whole video, I'm gonna download this because I'm gonna watch this a thousand times
VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOWWWWWWW
i just realize virgil kinda almost sounds like deadpool
Princiety shippers are screeching
I just love how Virgil and Roman, who normally never agree on anything, worked together the whole episode long!
I loved this! Please do more animatics!
Did I already watch this earlier? Yes. Am I rewatching this? Yes.
Also MY BABEY IS *BACK*
ok but Virgil's eyeshadow changes with his levels of panic and I'm LIVING FOR IT
Tomas panicking for 15 minutes in an animatic is something I never knew I needed  AND I DEFINITELY NEEDED IT
Omg I love Virgil’s purple under eye shadow it’s sooooo cool and awesome I love it
Roman:bravery. Me:EEEEEEEEEH   I forgot about this comment 🧍‍♀️
the purple eyeshadow on virgil ITS SO CUTE 😭
Both of them hate lyingggg. 👀
OMFG!, the ending was a perfect prinxiety moment!!!
*SQUEALS IN CUTE OVERLOAD*
24:05 OH! so THAT'S why i freak out at sudden noises!
Princey and Virgil being on the same side and coaching Thomas is amazing, they came so far in their relationship!
10:34 roman... no 🥺
ahhh, This episode was so cuteeee. A nice little break from the  angst, totally worth the wait, I love your videos so much Thomas!!
I LOVE THOMAS SO MUCH AHHHH
.       .       .    Their relationship has *grown* soo much and I love it!   Aslo virge do be a whole ass mood tho<3  Edit: mm yes english is too good i cant even spell right(′▽`〃) *im not gonna change my mistake, why bc i don't feel like it ;>*
YAY!
*I fangirl screeched so hard when I saw Thomas uploaded that I think I have myself tonsillitis*
V: in all honesty, idk what that was. R: bravery. Me: holy sanders just make out already jeez
Honestly I'm so in love with this - I don't even need a live action remake, Disney gives us enough of those already!
AAAHHHH THIS MADE MY DAY also that entire video is a mood i see a pretty girl, i go into gay panic mode and can't talk to her
roman: SHUT UP virgil: shut. up. me: ShUt uP OHMAIGAD
Thomas: "Top of the morning to ya" Me: TOP OF THE MORNING YA LADIES MY NAMES JACKSEPTICEYE
This was so so beautiful to watch! Thank you so so much! ♡
Ship sailing
YO THOMAS!!! I HAVE WATCHED UR VINES FOR A LOOOOONG TIME AND THEIR SO DANG FUNNY! Sorry for yelling I was over excited😅  To patton: You're awesome! To logan: thanks for info! To virgil: I understand the dark and edginess dude I truly do To roman: I hope you find someone to love princy!
I just wanna know if thomas actually ket someone
“Well, let’s not waste this one” WHOA SMOOTH MY GAY ASS FELT THAT IN MY BONES.  Get u a person who says that to u
Loving the purple eye shadow alternating
Okay, but like, that Janus shirt is *amazing* and I understand it's a perk for the first 1,000 patrons and I'm too late, but I would love it if one day in the future it makes it to the official store.
THIS WAS SO CUTE!!! I didn’t even know a new Sanders Sides was coming out today but all the awkwardness and cuteness in this episode made my day!
Is it just me or is virgil wearing his old jacket in the thumbnail
The art was so beautiful!!! It would be awesome to see more stuff like this!!
I can already see myself rewatching this over and over for the next five years
Yesss!
10:08 "I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay—" LMAO
11:51 hi thanks for checking in I'm *still a peace of garbage*
Poor bathroom guy
I love this sm bro I'm actually cryin bruhh
Yeah this it’s pretty much what social anxiety feels like 😂😂
This is litterally a prinexity video
Theory: When Virgil isn't Anxious his eyeshadows turn purple and wen he's anxious they are black :3  Edit: Prinxiety  P D P
THIS IS ADORABLE!!!!
The gay eyes made me laugh 😂
i really want to join the patreon but i don't have a credit card :')
That was so... cute!!
Virgil: 'I really dont know what that was' Roman:'...Bravery.' Me: *Simply ✨passing away✨*
"Pintrovert" GOT REALLY CLOSE TO MY NAME OML
Virgil with purple eyeliner is that him becoming less anxious
Most of this video was gay panic
16:02 is the essence of gay panic. You can’t convince me otherwise
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!
The three of them in the trash bin was so good. What a rollercoaster of emotions! This whole episode had me at the edge of my seat! Communication is truly an amazing power that could probably solve most problems. But where's the fun in that?! Such a well made animatic, amazing expressions and adorable artstyle! I love this!
OH MY FROOKING GOOOODDDDDDDD THIS IS GOOD that last sentence and virgil and roman was like shut up shut up i stood up and had to take a second lke this is GOOD CONTENT
It is truly amazing how well Thomas can tell a story, how each and every character feels like their own person, with their own beliefs and personalities. This episode was a treat to watch, not only because of the hard work of the artists, but also because we got to see a new side (haha) of Virgil. One who let himself get excited, one who, for once, wasn’t afraid of something going wrong. I’m so proud of him and I can’t wait to see where the story goes from here. ❤️  (Also obligatory “the Prinxiety was strong with this one” comment!)
mY PRINXIETY HEART
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE!!
I love roman and virgil in this episode 😅😅😅😅
I actually screamed when I saw this. HOW DID I MISS THIS!!!
Me before video even starts: YESSS!!! HAPPY DANCE. 👏👏👏👏
okay but like, this whole video is just YES. also, if it were possible, a live-action version would be just as amazing
Abd illustrates shdhdhdndbcjbcbfhdjdbfjd, I love his art
IM SREAMINGGGGGGGGGG
FRICK YEA ITS BACK
The prinexity shippers are freaking out
15:26  Me @ Virgil and Roman: JUST START SINGING DEAD GAY SON ALREADY FOR THE LOVE OF PATTON
i would join to be a member but i’m broke :(
Amazing as usual , what else can I expect from tommis always super inspirational and a true saint and overall just an amazing and truly wonderful person to have as a friend or just someone to look up to , and I can’t believe there’s such an awesome and creative individual such as him
I saw this and I clicked on this because I thought it was prinxiety but I got something even better
Also I love art and animatics so this is super exciting!! Love the art and animation!
I'm gonna gosh darn cry darn it SANDERS
about the pins and buttons - I have tons of them on my backpack and I seriously get so happy when someone actively asks to see them. Happened two times, once a young lady, once an old grandma, and I was so happy to show them my pin collection:-)
Virgil throughout the whole video was me in a nutshell! Like small soft edgy boi. Yeh me who will even put myself out of the comfort zone for my friends happiness nd seeing virgil do that has a lot of impact on me. Thanks so much for this sander sides video☺️ and THE MAKEUP! IT'S AMAZING!!!!! I LOVE IT!  p.s.  Am I going to ask my significant other to cosplay sander sides with me... Yes🏳️‍🌈
awwwwww :D
Damn, Thomas said prinxiety rights, huh?
one sec-    AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH- Before I even watch the thing I know IS GOOD!! Edit: OH GOD VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! HOOOOOO BOI!! WAT!!?
do i smell prinxiety??? also the boiled carrots thing had me cryinggg
YEEESSSS FINALLYYY ANOTHER SANDERS SIDESSS
OMG I LOVED THIS SO MUCH THAT I CRIED AT THE END OMG IT WAS SO CUTEEEEE I LOVE THIS AHHHH OMG VIRGIL AND ROMANS RELATIONSHIP HAS GROWN SO MUCH
I started too get sad that I couldn't afford the patreon thing, but it was nice too hear that I won't miss too much 😁
Did- did he really just post today
Virgils eyeshadow was purple!!!!!
Thomas: I don't want me to be doing this either and I will gladly sit back down John Mulaney: I don't like that I'm in that lane either, and I sure would like to get out of it  SAME ENERGY
Enjoying when Virgil's eyeshadow becomes purple when anxiety is on the positive scale
i swear to god this is too cute
the fact that ABDIllustrates was apart of the contribution had me excited to see what was in store and the artists made an awesome animatic to today's episode x3 i wonder how the live action will work *ponders*  My favorite parts in all this? Virgil mustering up the courage to give Thomas that push to talk to the guy near the end of the animatic after seeing how upset Roman was. The end card, seeing Virgil's eyeshadow in purple when he's legit excited and that they actually change when his anxiety goes up I love that detail x3 I can't wat to see what the next episode will bring :3
my prinxiety is *quaking*
20:34 I screeched omg (i love janus, if you couldn't tell; i mean i literally did the makeup just to watch this--)
I love the little detail about Virgil’s eyeshadow changing with his mood, it makes my heart happy
Yesssss, I loved this, I’m also happy to see Virgil
I'm so happy to see this video! Everyone that put work into this video did amazing, and I loved the product. Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
YES!! ITS FINALLY HERE😊🥳
I can't form a real sentence irl but uh- OJABSNGIUBDGRNIQOAUERNJGOFISNWETGI YES!!! VIRGIL WAS ADORABLE AND ROMAN I LOVE YOU.
WAIT THE PURPLE EYESHADOW-
OMG OMG OMG OMG I LOVE IT❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Me staring at Thomas’ soul until he releases a sequel: 👁👄👁
*jerard gay is the pun of the millennium*
When ur 3 hrs to late to a video and ur birthday is in 9 days :<
Nico: Let's not waste this one. Roman: *heart eyes* shut up! Virgil: shut up. Roman (again): *still with the heart eyes* Shut up! Me: *in shock, gaping at screen* Shut up!
I love seeing the character development of the three of them.
I have a feeling that Virgil is finally changing into a light side. Don't get me wrong he was still apart of the light sides but he was always a little more of a dark side Soo i think that (especially with the new colorful male up) he is finally adapting to become a real light side. And i have a theory that because he is becoming a light, he is changing traits! Like- The way he pushed Thomas to talk to that guy and ignore his anxiety and be brave! I have a theory that Virgil is becoming bravery! I would love to see him be and make Thomas brave. But that is just a theory💅 *_btw great video as always <3_*
I think this is honestly better as an animatic? Idk man secondhand embarrassment is strong goshdangit EDIT: but that ENDCARD THOUGH AAAAAAAH
I absolutely  love the eyeshadow
if my friends don’t call me “Gerard *Gay*” i need new friends
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW IM GONNA DIE
I love their relationship. They started off as hating each other and now they fight like siblings. i should know i have a sister
tomas being gay for people is adorable
This episode is so goddamn wholesome and I just love it.
yass sanders sides is back :D
The beginning I cracked up inside!!!! 😂😂😂, I’m so happy that your safe and your not sick, hope y’all are safe 💙
So is Voman a canon ship?
My love for this video, and the amount of detail in it, and the art work, and the Virgil eyeshadow swap is...........the opposite of infinitesimal TwT-
But can we appreciate that when Thomas gay panics he makes the worst excuses? This is just Janus panicking and I think it’s hilarious
This was awesome! I loved it so much!
NFBJAJDJA VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY, I LEGIT SCREECHED HE'S SO DAMN CU T E-  *And I saw how Virgil looked at Roman in that last drawing, these two are meant to be, you can't deny it, there is nOTHING THAT ANYONE CAN DO TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND.*  Unless Thomas doesn't like it. In that case I shalt surrender
Love to see you collaborating with other artists!!
Omg! Virgil pushing Thomas towards nico to make Roman happy almost make me cry! Broooo! 🥺🥺🥺
I got to watch BTS' concert Starkid is going live later today and I got to see my darling Thomas in the cutest video possible today is a good day <3
do ppl with anxiety also happy stim???? That's cool idk that
Thomas you're killing me here I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!! ASDJBFKLJDSFBLJHDFBALJHDFBALJHBDFALJHDFBALJHBLAJKHBDF
This video is kinda like an early bday gift cuz my bday is on the 30th of October
IM LATE BUT IM HERE
!!!! This !!!!!!
This was so awesome!! I'm kinda glad I didn't get asked if I was ok by my siblings and parents since I squealed..  The dog thing at the end also reminds me of the fact that neighbour keeps hanging on the walls or thundering down their stairs, either way; Amazing as always
WE ALL SAW THOSE HEARTS AT THE END RIGHT?! JUST ME??
19:38 proud parents
AAAAAAAAAARGH!! SO WHOLESOMEEEE! Also I’m a little sad now because the ideas of a sander sides-esk animatic video has been taken and done better than I ever could....
“Stop being fake with a plastic plant and go on!” Does anyone see the irony of that line?
Eh...         *It could be gayer*
AAAH YES THIS IS AMAZING
I really want to see re Zero therapy session
I love this so much! 💜❤
I love ABDillustrates! I'm so glad he helped with this, his art style is awesome! Also, them fangirling together at the end might be one of my favorite moments in Sanders Sides history
Nice blink 182 references virgil
Are roman and virgil gay are the dad's today
i love how roman and virgil just squabble like a married couple
hahaha thomas old go brrr
Prixiety fans are going off the walls rn
OMGGGGG
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE PRIXIGHTY MOMENTS EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This is so amazing I would love to see it in live action when possible! Also I wish I could join the patreon but I can't because I don't have that much money. Edit: I didn't have enough money for sales taxes on my card so I asked my mom and she said I could use her card but sadly I wasn't one of the first thousand patreon donors so I won't be getting the shirt. :'(
The prinxiety in here will fuel me for years.
I think when Thomas was wondering if he's ready and he was anxious about it, it made me think. I don't know if we can truly ever be "ready" for something like this. So whether or not he's ready, I think he should still go out there and give it a try. If you don't try to be with someone until you feel perfectly "ready", will that day even come? Can we ever be ready to be in a relationship? Lmk what you guys think
OH MY GOD PRINXIETY!! :D I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! 💜💜💜
THOMAS DID YOU REALLY GET THAT GUY
Where can I get to the animation video??
Why do I relate to this so much flirting is hard ((even with my girlfriend))
When I don't try and flirt, smooth AF When my anxiety kicks in, awkward lesbian   Honestly too many straight girls up in the gay bar has just caused me to give up hope that I'll find a girlfriend
it's stupidly wholesomes!! XD love it soo bad!
YESS VIRGILS BACK
"Will deceit be the answer to all of your problems?"  Janus: *mischievous laughter*
WHEN HE STARTED TALKING TO THE GUY I STARTED PACING THE FUCKING FLOOR  IM NOT EVEN KIDDING I STOOD UP AND STARYED WALING AROUND MY HOUDE
As always, what an incredible video. Made my day! Amazing! Sooooooo flippen good!!!!!!
Roman starstruck: "shut up?!"  Virgil Confused someone likes him back for once: "shut up."  Roman excited cause someone likes him back for once: "SHUT UPP!!!" **hearts a flutter**  Edit:: 19:28
The end is literally me when I saw someone that might have been my crush in the Walmart parking-lot
Y- yall are out here expressing yourself via stickers??? Im to scared to do even that ;-;
God I wish I wasn't broke
😏😏😏
Why is Asides?
AAAAAAAA MY PRINXIETY HEART CANT HANDLE THISSSSSSS :’)
that scene with virgil and roman pushing him around was so realistic, exactly what anxiety is like
OMG THAT WAS SO CUTE
Does this mean no bloopers ;-; 🥺
Now that I finally had time to digest the episode, I want to say this was such a beautiful episode. Thank you so much for this! I can't imagine how much effort had been put into this. Also this was published on my birthday, so it was like receiving the best birthday gift possible! Thank you again for putting your time and effort to this masterpiece!! You and your friends were incredible as always ❤❤
Me dying in being single 👁️👄👁️
*Cue intense screeching from the prinxiety shippers*
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING  My anxiety:..but maybe you should’ve said it was BETTER
Ouch y’all really bein mean to Janus
Me who only ships Moxiety 👁️👄👁️
OMG THIS WHOLE EPISODE MADE ME HAPPY STIM! 😊 I absolutely love the art and this whole episode!
YESSSS
*Me seeing Alex helped with this episode:* LOOK AT MY BOY! I'M SO PROUD! ITS WHAT HE DESERVES!
This was about the sweetest and most relatable thing I've seen all quarantine
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FACT TAHT VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE
The episode starts at 2:24 (for anyone who needs it)
alright with the eye shadow thing i think it might be something along the lines of there being a different side of virgil, like curiosity or maybe courage..... yes, no, maybe, idk at this point
I love you more and more each time I see you.❤️
Detective prinxiety on the case 😎😎
Aghahhah...that's my response of excitement and overwhelming emotions
Me knowing I will never be able to see a live action version: **cries in poor**
Poor bathroom guy ;__;
I can feel the prinxiety shippers eating this up like it’s a fan fiction feast
I'm fangirling too much. I love this so much
... I feel called out...
prinxiety stans love this
I SCREAMED WATCHING THIS AAAHHHH
What this taught me: -I need to finally get my hands on some pins -I have to talk to someone next monday.... And if I can't find the courage (again) I'll probably hate myself later
Can we just talk about virgils eyeshadow detail
PRETTY GAYYYYYYYYYYY
That was so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Virgil getting all excited with Roman and Thomas about a cute dude was something I didn’t know I needed-
What if this turned into a gay disney cartoon
So so so so cooooool🙏🙏🙏
Yeah I’m not going to lie I sort of what this in a live action because I feel like it’s incomplete like how animated movies are they draw it all and then they add the animation so with it being a drawing it just sort of feels incomplete but it was great
Me a prinxeity fan: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEWEEEEE SO MUCH CONTENT TO USE IN FANFICSSS also anyone else noticed that eyeshadow changes between Virgil smiling and stuff 🧐
I love ittttt!!! 💞
That was amazing 😍
OMG I LOVED THIS VIDEO!! I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE IT. I did see virgil's eyeshadow was purple, I love that!  Glad to know some of the info in your life going well for you!! Stay safe!
Oh god I can hear fangirls just starting to write more fan fics about Roman and Virgil and I'll just sit there and say " Dudes Roman was just happy. Yes some of his statements got us to think that he loves Virgil but my dudes. THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON "
I have never wanted to support a creator on patreon more than I do now
IM GONNA CRY THIS IS SO AMAZING-
Sorry I could not watch this video, straight all the way through, I had to watch it gay all the way through.
I felt this to the depths of my little bi heart. I’ve literally done this before..... I thought I was the only one!   ......I still have to apologise to that girl.....
Everyone else at the restaurant watching him talk to himself 👁️👄👁️
WAIT THOMAS HAS A BOYFRIEND NOW???     *AHHHHHHH*
SO  MUCH HAPPY STIMMING! Aghhhhhh yes new Sanders side 😄😆🤗
"love is a key ingredient in all the best recipes" me: wha- n- that doesn't mak-  "after salt" me: oh you got me worried for a sec
Thomas, is this the announcement to you getting a BF!?
No one: Not even Remus:     Virgil: *P I N S*
i would love to join the patreon,but i am argentinian and the dolar is over the clouds ;-;
Aww ♥️
I replayed Roman calling Virgil by his name like three times LOL 9:33
OMG THOMAS THIS IS EVERYTHING!!!
Hi (say hi back please)
"... you saw me knock over that trash can didn't you" "THAT WAS YOU?!?"  THAT WAS SO CUTE AND SO FUNNY!!!! THIS STORY WAS  SO SWEET AND THE ARTSTYLE WAS ADORABLE I LOVED IT THOMAS AND FRIENDS BEAUTIFUL JOB!!!!!! Amazing omg my heart this was the perfect balance of comedy and realism
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO DAMN MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  also Virgil, do you know what bravory is? doesnt matter if you do or dont, im telling you anyway. its being scared to do something and doing it anyway. you were brave and regardless of all the scary stuff going on in your head making you think otherwise you are awesome i am proud of you and we all love you
THOMAS YOU CANNOT OFFER WRITING EPISODES BECAUSE IM A BROKE CHILD
MY PRINXIETY SOUL AAAAAAAA
Roman: Blatantly stealing now huh grandpa?!
its the "shut up emo" for me aidkfzigzgkd
Is nobody gonna mention that Virgil's Eyeshadow is now purple? Work it my anxious boi!!
The actual panic when you’re trying to find out if a cute person is gay or not is so real!
AAAAAAAAAAAA, ITS SO COOL!!! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH !!!
This entire video hurts me omfg
THIS WAS THE CUTEST GAY PANIC. AHHH.  also I love the name Gerard gay WAY too much--
this sanders asides is the embodiment of gay panic-
also VIRGIL'S EYESHADOOOOOOOOW
Maybe the purp eyeshadow mixed with white represents the good type of anxiety.
Omg that ENDING (not the end card) UGGHH MY PRINXIETY HEART CANT TAKE ITTTTT
Wait- is prinxiety like- cannon now or-........are we gonna pretend this didnt happen-
Omg!!!! YESSSSSSS
Ahhh hes back. The world needs him rn
When Roman said "Speak from the heart", I was like, " Where's Patton!?
Awwww honestly I loved this as an animatic! So wholesome and heartwarming!   Also Virgils's purple eyeshadow is just *chef's kiss*
I love this so much. so much. SO MUCH. this is so great i love the animation 💕
There’s just those small moments inside most videos, exchanged looks
I would like to but I don’t have any money sorry
Dog barks   Virgil: Demon!
So are we like...... Not gonna talk about the still non existent of the new sides
Virgil and Roman yes good job Prinxiety for the win
THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME!! I just went home cause it was to draining to be out with my parents anymore. So now im home but my sister's having a party so im just in my room needing something to take up my time.
Let’s appreciate how much effort goes into the Sanders sides videos
BRA👏🏼VO👏🏼 you guys are THEE best writers on YouTube, I swear!
RIP to the poor guy in the bathroom
Alright so.... Virgil Sanders..... His eyeshadow keeps changing. Like... Everytime he gets happy it turns purple when he gets happy-
Oh my god! I ship Prinxiety! ❤️
AHHHHH AKSNWHISJEBWBEBE
BROOO, I'M CRYNG!
thank you artists!!!!! I absolutely loved EVERY aspect of this video! you guys are truly talented!!!
SCREEEEE
Ship confirmed??????
“It’s like cyberstalking...but in real life” “So.......... stalking?” “<Ten minutes later>...OH YOURE RIGHT”   Why is this Virgil me constantly in all conversations Also thank you to the artists! Y’all did a truly amazing job! Especially the expressions!!!
*MY HEART* T^T
I love how Roman and Virgil who are usually rude to each other, are are being so sweet together
This is my favorite sander sides episode!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my FREAKING GOD Virgil's eyeshadow turns glittery and purple when he's happy I am so soft for this boi I swear to god
really nice callback, with Virgil sitting on the counter in the wash-room.
I loved this and at the end did I se Prinxiety like ahhh!!!!!!!!! And I can’t do the Patreon thing I’m not allowed sorry! But love you
“AH DEMON” lol I love Virgil
i can practically SMELL the fanfiction
Dont make me sad!
I love watching sanders sides videos and I love this one too... but... ITS JUST SO HARD TO WATCH! THE SECOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT! UGH.. I JUST... CANT!
The secondhand anxiety is real in this episode.
How do you turn on notifications?
Your videos are so cute!!!!!!!
It took me an hour to watch this video because I kept pausing to laugh, squeal, or feel second hand embarrassment for Thomas.
Logan stans are staring a riot Thomas what have you done-
What was a really well put together episode but cheezitz crust can Thomas make everything super awkward but I mean you can tell someone is gay if they also are a homophobe
The art is SO CUTE in this, props to all the artists they did amazing :,)
I love Virgil’s new eyeshadow design! Its really cool! We love ya Thomas! ❤️
I loved loved loved this video it was so cute! Also I love the new touch on Virgils eyeshadow! I love that when he’s happy and more relaxed it turns purple and when he’s anxious or angry it’s black
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW THAT WAS SO CUUUUUUUUTE!
My feelings TwT
THIS IS AMAZING WMWJWANBSSJSJSJ I can’t wait for the live action! You’re amazing Thomas!
I WAS NOT READY FOR THE EYESHADOW CHANGE!!!!
I almost cried!!! this is so cute thomasssssssss
Thomas. Do you know what you've done? The fandom is losing their minds right now, Tumblr has lost it already from what I've seen so far, and I have multiple people texting me in all caps ranting about this Asides episode.
sooooooooooooooo CUTE
When there in the bathroom it looks like something you would see girls doin,like giving there girl friends advice while doing make up
I honestly don't know what gay eyes are either, and I'm super gay......well more of a sheltered disaster gay😞
It’s been so long
I'm not crying, YOU are crying
I hate to rain on your Black Parade
* sees ABD Illustrates* -fangirl squeals 😄 -  After watching the video: This was an amazing job made by you and all the artists! Also, I do hope that it’ll be possible for a live version of this to be made during the right time. I hope you all continue to create amazing things! And please remember to stay safe! 😄   Btw, I think Virgil’s eyeshadow gets purple when he’s super happy, and when he starts to go back to his normal states, it goes back to black       Extra:  1. -also squeals in prinxiety 😆😆😆😆 - 2. 23:31 (anyone else thought of Probable Theorem at this part? Just wondering.)  Edit 3. 19:40 Ok it may be in a more familial way instead of prinxiety, but still I enjoy their interactions 4. 6:34 I just realized — why do they need five mics? 😂 5. 6:54 oh Roman has high boots
All of the Prinxiety fans had better day because of this new Sanders Asides ep
Virgils eyeshadow turns purple when he’s happy  How long has this been a thing?
19:38 GUYS VIRGIL IS SHORTER
When you finish watching and you can just FEEL the fanders and prinxiety shippers just, combusting out of sheer excitement? No? Just me?
i also love how even in the excitement at the end, you can see virgil begin to question if they’re ready for it/starting to stress out about it (also i’ve missed demon voice, loved how we got to hear it when he said “A DEMON”)
Oh yeah im getting that patreon also the romantic in me is absolutely vibing right now!!!
Thomas that was adorable chkfiglj ldklydiltsjtldioteshlltols * happy sheecing* hogifjjtxtjdnf
THIS IS SO CUTE
Seeing not only Thomas and Roman freaking out but also Virgil jointing them equally excited with them just makes me so happy❤️
IM GAY thank you for coming to my ted talk
What if you do the antimatics for when you go into the different areas of the Mind Palace
I'm gonna cry this was adorable
9:15   THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER
literally cried with frustration when the moment at the end was interrupted by a damnable voting ad. i mean, cute moment, though.
Did this actually happen?
What was Virgil thinking about before the dog started barking?
I can’t tell if Thomas is trying to encourage Prinxiety or not
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH <3 I was screaming most of the animation lol
This is me being early
Omg i will definintly buy like 5 different things or m0re- i lughed so hard during this amazing episode!
See this is why you need a super social Hufflepuff friend to go ask him out for you
Why did Virgil's eyeshadow keep changing?
Can we all agree that “Oh shut up Emo” was the best line 😳
VIRGIL! Just know we all care about you, and some dogs do scare us into yelling "Demon", but uh... Why did your voice echo? Just a question..
who actually watches you any more
Is no one going to talk about Virgil’s Blink-182 reference?  “You can live like Jack and Sally, if you want”  5:18
♥️
I littarly thought that Virgil and Roman were gonna kiss. I have a feeling that Virgil likes him I mean cmon Virgil were blushing and did anyone else see Virgils face before the dog/demon started barking. Loved this
The purple eyeshadow looks so good on Virgil!! I hope it stays throughout the next episodes
This brightened my day so much!!
I saw the 96 number on the table and my mind whispered "club 96"
No one:  Not a soul: All prinxiety shippers: *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
I've missed sander sides
Me : playing panic! At the disco . Me : sees virgil and roman . Me : EEEEEE I SHAL GIVE UP PANIC FOR THOMAS. Edit : i see the patreon my brain : lorelei you have no money . Me : SHUSH
I'm screeching on all the emo reference
Omg it’s amazing! I love this so much!!! Also love Virgil’s makeup at the end the purple is just 👌. I really wish I could join the patreon!
I really appreciate the attention to detail with the color of Virgil’s eyeshadow changing to match his mood at the end.
PRINCXIETY COMFIRMED?
When Virgil is happ, it makes me happ
PRINCEITY TAT
Oh my god... I LOVE VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW—
This is the first one I’ve watched in so long omgs and wow huge nostalgia I didn’t realize how much I missed these boys
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT FINALE SECNE WITH ROMAN AND VIRGIL LIKE OMG!!!!! It was so pure😭
Awwww 🥺 this was so adorable :3
Ok. I really love this script so much. The lines are so goodd
A
when the first half of the vid was saying Tomas is a liar but you don't see Janus  sad snake noise
6:50 “you’re a creep, a weirdo....what the hell are we doing here?”   Nice
Anyone else notice how excited Virgil is? It’s a bit frightening
This is the closest to Prinxiety canon that we’ve had so long. This is glorious and I love it. So pure!!
I’M ALREADY CRYING AT THE INTRO
IM CACKLING-  “did you not flush”  “i didnt want to ruin the moment🥺”
Just a note, the name Nico means victory
So I misinterpreted the "him" at 14:45 as referring to Janus and not the other guy and I was like, "Wow Virgil that's very interesting of you to be concerned about Janus' workload," and then I realized and I was disappointed.
I’ve only watched 3 minutes of this and Virgil is just amazing, I love my dark strange son
ABD!!! IVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM FOR YEARS! IM SO HAPPY TO SEE HIS ART IN A VIDEO QuQ
I am 3 HOURS late THIS IS AN EMBERASMENT
This whole video is a mood
This is cute 🥰😍!!!!!!
I know it may be a problematic request or unseen comment, but is it there any possibility that you will put your script in the pinned comment or in the description? Many of us who watch Sander (a)Sides do not speak English as a native language. So it would be so much easier to follow what you say if we were able to see the words. It could bring us the possibility to check unknown words too.  I know there is an option such us auto translating, but to be honest it doesn't always gives you the correct words and it can bring more confusion I hope you're going to see my comment and consider this solution
Anyone else see the eyeshadow?
I LOVED this ! I feel this will help a lot of people keep doing what you do Thomas your amazing yours and your entire team great job!
me: 'sees virgil's eye shadow purple, doesnt think much of it' also me: time for some new fan art
*Screams in gay*
God this episode was so relatable- I was just this awkward and anxious in my own way with my crush (who is now my lovely girlfriend). Glad to know anxiety is a normal (gay) thing lmao! XD
Woah. What happened to Virge's eyeshadow? I'm not complaining, but he's really selling the purple. You rock it sir!
A THOUSAND MOONS AGO boy who ran away I heard that Thomas 24:03
Honestly this animatic just made me sad. Because this has happened to me so many times, but it hasn’t turned out so great. You don’t see the pins and the rainbow flag. You trip on the ground and you run to the washroom. You can’t give yourself a pep talk because saying anything aloud makes you too anxious. And the guy never sees you again. He doesn’t bring you back your food and you never have the courage to talk to him. Sorry to be such a bummer, but god am I awful at being gay and eternally wanting a relationship.
Me at the beginning: >:3 Me at the end: UwU
VIRGIL BEING HAPPY IS LIKE GIVING A MAD DOG CUDDLES!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE- Idk that just came into my mind.
Can we just appreciate all the effort put into this video? They found a way to work around the challenges of covid-19 safely while still presenting to us such quality content. HUGE props to the artists I mean seriously, bringing this episode to life! And Thomas and Joan and everyone who worked on this to make it happen. ❤️❤️
i was already emotionally unstable today then glittery purple eyeshadow virgil happened and now i need to lie down and weep
Gerard Gay
I had to watch it a second time to notice the final ending 😂 Also, Roman with the rule of thirds "30 times a day" 😂😂😂
Roman and Virgil working together, that is gay panic XD edit: where is the heart button for videos? YouTube, please get on that!
I just... I'm wondering how I dont have a virgil fictive
Ok I absolutely love the purple eyeshadow for Virgil it fits him so well I hope we see that more in the future.🏳️‍🌈💜❤💙💛💙💚🏳️‍🌈
Remember that one episode where Thomas mention he hates carrots and that’s why in this episode he didn’t wanna eat the carrots
I love this so much!!! Oh my gosh everyone did 100000000/10 awesome!!! Dont mind me as I watch it all over again! It's so cute ❤🥰🌈😁😍😂🥰
I'm crying
I know so many people have commented about this BUT THE HAPPY PURPLE EYE BAGS!!!!!!!!!!!! That makes me so happy
You’re killing me, Smalls.   Is... Virgil small-
GUYS, THE AMAZINGNESS OF VIRGIL AND ROMAN'S RELATIONSHIP, THE DIFFERENT EYESHADOWS, THE ART STYLE, THE BATHROOM SCENE, LIKE ALL THE SCENES ACTUALLY, OH MY GOSH WHAT TO LOVE FIRST, I-
OMG THE MONOLOUGE IS BEAUTIFUL!!!! and then the end lmao "yea I was just practicing for a non-improvised monolouge...totally"
I want love and sweetness in my life :c it was so cool.
AHHHHHHHHHHH THE PRINXIETY IN THIS!!!! SJGHUSKGYIW
THE SHAKING THE HAND THING THE WALKING AROUND THE ROOM AT THE END AND THE HAPPY SCREAMS!! OMG IT MADE ME SO HAPPY TO SEE OTHERS WHO STIM LIKE THISS!!
ANYONE ELSE GOT PRINXIETY VIBS FORM   E V E R Y T H I N G?????
Oh lord. This is the most relatable thing I’ve ever seen
PRINCEXIETY!!!!!❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜❤
Thomas dealing with Prinxiety
Can we talk about Virgil getting Thomas to stim??? I mean thank you so much for including that Thomas seriously it made me so happy
I love the gays eyes part
The Roman x Virgil shippers at the end: -un holy screaming-
All the art and the entire animatic were cute. Story amazing. I'd love to see both a drawn and real life version to any story. 10/10
I am *exceedingly ecstatic* about the energy we have created in the studio today can we also talk about how incredible the animatic was??? AHHH I love it!!! Amazing work sanders sides team! <3
I been waiting for this one. Wooooooo finally      After months... GOD! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??
We still dont know is he's gay  Add break :attack adds
22:34 to 24:13 Is Virgil okay, his eye shadow kept changing to purple to black and he was freaking out a bit to much. I was actually freaking out when I saw that the new sanders asides was finally posted.
I'm so happy to be watching a new episode my sholders are clenched up like my body wants to hug itself to death. My inner Patton is showing itself 😄
WHEN VIRGIL IS EXCITED HIS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE
"Do you want this food because...I don't..."
im gonna scream cry
AHHHHHHHHHH FRICK PRINXIETY AHHHHHHH
Mama Kat is crying (and wishing she could afford Patreon she frantically shares this with everyone, their uncle and their uncle’s duck).
We NEED to check on Roman soon their just to much hints of angst in this episode. Also ROMAN X VIRGIL yesssssssssssss💜❤️
Wait does thomas actually have a boyfriend?I'm confused
The amount of second-hand embarrassment here. pancoqnxownxodn  i just finished watching everything else. and i relate so hard to this ;_;
If I am making a mistake I’ll add it to the list-
"That's like cyber stalking... but real life!" "So stalking." "...oH YOU'RE RIGHT."
Unrelated, but we NEED a "She-Ra Cartoon Therapy".
VIRGILS EYESHADOW COLORS?? IS THIS NEW??
I felt so called out dhdndnfndjd
OK SO I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT HAPPY VIRGIL WITH SPARKLY PURPLE EYESHADOW IS THE BEST FUCKING THING ON THIS PLANET RIGHT????
I wonder if Princey’s outfit in this animatic is actually canon... Leg reveal??? 6:53
The amount of times I had to pause because  secondhand embarrassment decided to kick me in the face was astounding Edit: stimmy sides canon!!!! STIMMY SIDES CANON!!! *STIMMY SIDES CANON!!!!!!!*
Ok I love how virgil is starting to show more and more of his light side with the purple eye shadow when he's happy
PURPLE!!!! EYSHADOW!!!! HAPPY!!!! VIRGIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh dear. You know your anxiety’s bad when you can’t even watch this video with out breaks 😓
okay im literally so soft this video was so cute i really loved it good job on this episode guys!!!
Am I the only one feeling kinda called out? Just me? Ok.
i love the change in Virgil's makeup when he"s excited. you guys are amazing
Roman and Virgil, the best duo to make you question your existance
Virgil: "I really don't know what that was" Roman: "Bravery" Me: *crying*
Alright i'll bite what is with the CONSTANT bringing up of thomas being a liar what does that mean ?? Janus took a vacation and now theyre picking up the slack ahdjsdjdkfjd??
Virgils eyeshadow changed when he was happy!!!!!!!! My baby boy!!!!!!
Roman x Virgil patton x Logan Dee x Remus ALL GAYY he is gay! YESH
22:21 I wish to watch this part over and over again
I WANT MONEY FOR THE THINGGGGGGGGG
Roman: you gotta try speaking from the heart  Me an intellectual: but Patton isn’t here    (I can also hear the fangirl screams from here)
Thomas: *makes Sanders Asides to have easier to make Sanders Sides content* Also Thomas: *makes a 24 minutes long ANIMATIC Sanders Asides episode*
DID NO ONE CATCH VIRGL'S "You're a creep, you're a werido-" AS IN REFRENCE TO THE SONG???
TOMAS!!!! OH MY GOSH!!! HELLO!!! ive been bindge watching your videos, and tiktoks....
This was a brilliant idea! I love the creativity that you all put in to this episode. I loved it!!
EEEEEEEE i love it
Nobody: Thomas: iuno, plant?
Ok but the way that virgil and Roman looked at eachother also the little hearts by Roman👀 idk seems a bit gay to me. I love the bond they have
“You’re a creep... you’re a weirdo... whaat the hell are we doing here.” Heh heh. I really hope that was on purpose. Also boy oh boy that whole thing was wholesome.
Thomas is literally me rn XD
V: Im like a triple expert, an Ex-Ex- Expert  R: Easy Tiger   Me: why... Thomathy? Why?
SOBS THAT WAS SO SWEET I LOVED IT
YASSSSS
AJDNEKGJ THE END??? MY PRINXIETY LOVING HEAT IS GOING 💓💖💝💗💕💗💓💗💝💖💕✨💝💗💗💗😆💗🥺😼💗😼💓
I just love it when Virgil and Roman when they actually have conversations without insulting eachother, overall loved this side episode!         P.s. I absolutely am loving Thomas and the Sander Sides character development.
**me trying to not ship because most people don’t appreciate being shipped and also because Roman and Virgil are both technically just Thomas**
Virgil's eye makeup when he's happy is the cutest thing on this earth.
That was the cutest thing I've seen in a long, long time!!! <3
Omg the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow changes colors when he's happy and excited it sO CUTE!!!!
Roman and Virgil: Liar!! Janus: you’ve summoned me. Edit: https://youtu.be/ggcX4r_GUP8
This was so adorable! I'm glad you are making Sander Sides again!
Uhoh-
I absolutely love animatics tho
22:22
Didn't think that Roman and Virgil would make such a great duo both when putting Thomas down and trying to get him to do something
Holy heck that was SOOOO GOOD and I didn't realize how much I missed Sanders Sides 😍 I would LIVE for a live version of this when it's safe to do so ong
Hold on, does Virgil's makeup change whenever he's happy??
And I'm being virgil for Halloween because I have more anitexy then creativity sorry roman
Also the lil bit of anxiety voice at the end with the "demon!"
Uuu am I the only one who noticed Virgil makeup turn black around  23.17, idk if its intentional or not xD
Wait...Virgils eyeshadow at the end..thats pretty smart! Our boi has purple eyeshadow when he is happy thats cute!
10:07 did Roman call Virgil gay? I could be reading into this too much but maybe he wants him to be gay? Ya I’m reading into this to much I’ll just see myself out
Also I''ve missed our gloomy gus!!!!!!
This was so cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 please make more animatics! pitch a cartoon!
OMG virgils eyeshadow changed Ahhhhhh purple is the best
In the end why does virgils eyeshadow change from purple to black and back? Does this depend on his emotional status?
Bravery, that’s right.  This was beautiful.  I love it.
KSNDKEBDDKXNSKDBXJEND I CAN'T EVEN- THIS IS SO CUTE DJDJXKX
The changing of Virgil's eyeshadow!?!?!?!? Um, YASSSSSSSSS
That castle do be vibin in the background doe
THE EXTRA PURPLE UNDER VIRGIL'S EYES IN THE SMALL LIVE ACTION PART AT THE END IS SO GOOD I LOVE THAT
THAT EYESHADOW THOUGH!!!! Is it tied to Virgil's emotions or something!?!!?
“Ughh Pintroverts.”  Me: alright, just call me out lmfao  Edit: Virgil: “Who hangs out at the mall alone for this long anyway?” Me, who has no friends but the mall fills my social battery while not depleting it too much: “...........”  Edit #2:  Roman: “Thomas..you’re going to have to try speaking from the heart.” Thomas: *shocked & kinda despairing face*  The Ad that plays right after: *silently shows a car driving far away from civilization*  Edit #3: Okay, so idk how you somehow described my entire life in 20ish minutes. 😂
Not me crying while watching this because I adore animation and seeing wholesome mlm content, especially in animated formats, is so rare. Not me. Wrong b*tch.
Virgil: It’s like cyber stalking... but real life Roman: So.. stalking? Vigil: OH RIGHT
" I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay" oh my gosh that was good
I love virgil's new eye shadow!!! It's amazing!! Also the art style was adorable!!!
10:12 STOP IM ALREADY EMO!!!
Nobody:  Absolutely nobody:  Me: Slams keyboard down as soon as i see the video  Edit: I actually broke it ;-;
So do you actually have a boyfriend now, or is this just for plot? I require answers
Awww that’s so cute, I might cry
It seems like virgils eyeshadow changes when he feels good or is excited OWO
Your back!
Ok not enough people are giving a standing ovation to the artists that made this episode possible, not only did they rise to the occasion to bring us all new sander sides content but they knocked it out of the park in every way imaginable, the animatic was phenomenal!
Virgil called Janus Deciet...Does he not know what happened in the last episode? Did no one tell him??
WAIT DID VIGIL'S EYE SHADOW CHANGE FROM BLACK TO PURPLE WHEN HE BECAME HAPPY HOLY SHEET I'M SMART
I'm crying i love this so much
i cannot describe how hard it was to watch this with my second hand anxiety
OMG Thomas i’m so happy for you!!! You and Nico are perfect for each other and i LOVE IT 😁   (anybody else think it was adorable how Virgil was freaking out at the end tho? i’ve never seen him like that before and his eyeshadow was purple too! definitely a good look on you Virge!)
This made me ugly cry happy tears. Go Thomas!!!
Ok but the purple eyeshadow!!!! And the change to black every time Virgil got regular/bad anxiety aaaaahhhh I love the symbolism. Keep it up guys!!!
I’m in this video and I don’t like it 😂 Also when Virgil said “without going to the extreme... like talking” I also said like talking at the same time 😂 #IAmVirgilConfirmed
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG AND THIS IS SO GOOD MY HEART 💗
P L A N T ✨
I love this, you are so amazing and everyone you work with!!! I’m excited for the future!!! 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Did anyone else notice virgil's makeup in the end scene?
Im so sad im late TnT i love this so much you are my favorite youtuber ever
This is honestly my daily life in a nutshell
THE PURPLE EYESHADOWW AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
this was so fun!
okay but like r o m a n you okay there buddy? towards the beginning you didn't seem to be doing too well
If I were you say this you look familiar have we met before
“Putting stickers on stuff...pretty gay.”  Phil Lester anyone?!
Omg virgil saw roman and just pushed Thomas and blushed omg oh my God the blushing the cuteness and dare I say the ship?
Um, we need to talk about the fact that Virgil’s eyeshadow is PURPLE!! At first I thought it was a filming error, but then I see a pattern. He’s happy and excited when it’s purple! New things that are important to the story line??? Thomas you sly dog...
Omg I missed you SO MUCH Thomas
THEY LOOK SO HAPPY AT THE END AAAAAAAHHHH VIRGIL WAS SMILING I LOVE HIM
And then I cried 😢😢💜💜
His eye shadow was purple and he screamed in excitement, VIRGIL HAS COME SO FAR. It's not physically possible to express how happy I am
Gerard gay
15:45 OKay when Virgil says "Is that fair to him?" Is he talking about Janus or the cute guy?? and what Thomas says afterward for crying out loud?
Umm wOw
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! I HAVEN’T FELT THIS ALIVE IN FIVE MONTHS!!!!
LIVE ACTION PLEASE!  This was awesome!!!
I ADORE the Emotive Eyeliner
"I hate to rain on your Black Parade Gerald Gay" okay that's the solid best nickname reference Roman has given Virgil ever
That hit home. So much. Thank you, your content gives hope.
This is me on a daily basis with just about everyone... 😅
My prinxiety soul : this is beautiful  Rociet : hello am here forgot me  Me : sorry but look at this 🥺  Logan x roman : hello heyyy am here   My unconditional love for roman: as long as roman is there
"Pintrovert."  I'll be using that from now on
CHARACTER THOMAS HAS A BOYFRIEND- I'm genuinely so happy for him right now
OML VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW IS SO CUTE
oh my god that was amaziny
Oh my gosh words cannot describe how much I enjoyed watching this. Great job to the artists and to Thomas and Crew! You all are amazing!   Also, Virgil’s eyeshadow during the end card. Nice touch.
So many respect and praise to the incredible artists this is soooo much work but it turned out amazing❤️
Tbh, the nonbinary pals part of the o UK tro hit so much different now that I know I'm a demiboy

Awwww that was adorable
Omg I love Virgils new eyeshadow!!!! 💗💗💗💗🤩🤩🤩
Wait does virgil's eyeshadow turn bright purple when he's like flustered or happy?
Was this episode meant to make me feel this uncomfortable?  Until it was cute.
This video made me die inside. But in a good way
So Deceit's name is Janus?
I supported through the $5 option for about two years and I'm gladly changing the option to the $25 😊💕
I'M NO CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!         ;-; I don't know why this hit so close to home and why it tugged on my heart strings.
This episode was so freaking cute im screaming
Okay but recently I was out and about and I saw this beautiful girl, I mean like the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. So I (SOMEHOW??? I LITTERALY STILL DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED???) went up to her and got her number!! And it's going really well!!! I AM GOING TO CRY!!!

my life depends on happy Virgil and the purple eyeshadow
Can we please talk about Virgil's eyeshadow?!?!
I am so ready to read all of the headcanons for purple eyeshadow
WE NEED TO SEE THIS IN LIVE ACTION!!! 🌈
i had to take a moment after "i hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay"
Nico is Thomas' perfect Carlos
This was so cute
the needing to do something with hands is very relatable I thought it was just me ahhaha
I cannot handle how cute that was. So much cute! Also a hella mood.
Did this actually happen or is it just a story. Either way it's adorable
I just lost my dad a few weeks ago. I’ve been feeling really numb and overwhelmed all the time, but I love sanders sides and rewatching them kinda made me feel better. Watching this new episode has me so giddy and it’s so freaking awesome!! Thanks for getting me through the day dude!
Did I just see princxiety??? Towards the end 🤔
I'd love to see more of these.
That was so cute!!! I’m so excited about the Patreon! Loved this so much
Pintroverts
Virgil got purple eyeshadow for a time!!!!
Sanders Sides Episode coming soon?
I feel bad for the guy in the bathroom. That’s my relationship status. Toilet paper.
Virgil: "I'm like a TRIPLE expert... An XXXpert." Ohhhh Virgil. You sweet innocent cinnamon bun, you. Edit: VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW GETS BRIGHT PURPLE WHEN HE'S EXCITED OMGGGG..
I wish I could've done the patreon thing but I'm poor af T^T
“I don’t know... plant” in love Thomas Sanders 2020
im smiling so wide right now
*Sees episode* gets jittery excited *finishes episode* the FANFIC I could write!!!! They’re so adorable.
Virgil’s eyeliner is wonderful- I wanna see it more often please and thank you. Wait wait wait when his eyeshadow kept changing at the end... which dark side was there-
24:00 did his eyeshadow turn back to black?? Is it just me or did it turn back to black?
That was really sweet and did anyone else notice Virgil's eye shadow!? it was purple! dos this mean it turns purple whe his exsided!?
g ah big mood
"He's in his 30s he might as well be 60" I felt that deeply
I want made an a fandub in spanish! omg I love It!
.....so does this mean that our King finally has met is prince?
AHHHH
22:49  I JUST NOTICED VIRGIL'S EYEBAG..ARE GONE! NOW THERE IS JUST LAVENDER EYESHADOW VIRGIL IS NOW A SIDE THAT IS A HAPPY BOI OMGOMGOMGOMG
I love the new detail in the makeup on Virgil where if he’s happy and relaxed beneath his eyes are purple and sparkly but when he’s more anxious it’s back to black. It feels cartoony💙
This thing seriously hit so close to home  W o a h
I loves this videos!!🥺🥺🏳️‍🌈🥰
All of them freaking out at the end and bonding over a cute guy and Virgil’s purple eyeshadow ahhh this episode is soooooo cute!!! good job Thomas and team and artists this this is super awesome!
Thankyou, thankyou for posting, i've had the most crappiest day ever, i've cried more than once and i am actually crying while typing this so thankyou, im so grateful that you posted today because this really lifts my spirits, im so sorry for this sad comment but i really needed to let you know just how amazing of a job your doing even with covid and all that's going on in the world, but you've made my day that little bit better I swear i most probably would have had a mental breakdown without this vid x❤️
no one: me when a thomas sanders video comes out: omg thank you for the free serotonin sir
I ship it
I'm actually crying-  I've always had bad feelings towards Virgil, but I think this has changed that- I'm just so happy to see he and Roman getting along, the new eyeshadow thing where its brighter when he's happier, also just all the gay panic. The artists for this episode did so amazing! (Also, did anyone see V and Ro blushing while looking at each other close to the end?????)
I cannot watch this. It gives me anxiety. No joke.
THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED
YES JUST YES THE GAYNESS THE VIRGIL THE EVERYTHING-
virgil telling thomas to stim to help manage anxiety!! stim stim stim!! is good!
I love this so much!!
*Anything flirty happens * Virgil: *gay panic intensifies*  CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW SHIFT WHEN HE'S EXCITED 😭💕 and then back to black lol😂
Huh :D        Delete it.
i loved this animatic format!!!
i seriously wish i could donate to the patroen like seriously i-
ARE WE NOT GOING TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT VIRG HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW INSTEAD OF THE USUAL BLACK???? I STAN MY BOI SO FREAKING HARD AHHHHH 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"liar" :D
Okay so 1) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 2) *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*  3) This was SUCH a good episode I love the recent focus on limited side combos, allows them to discuss certain topics more/prevent less chaos, it's so good. And while I'd love to see a live action version of this, my first instinct is to probably keep it as an animatic There's a lot of shots that would require Thomas in the same frame as himself and that can make editing a little awkward. But even then If this does become live action, I'm not totally against it. Everyone did such a great job on this, and I love the added detail with Virgil's eyeshadow at the end. This was just SO GOOD.
roman said 👉👈
"you're making a mistake" "IF I AM, I'LL ADD IT TO THE LIST"  aRE WE JUST GLOSSING OVER THE FACT THAT ROMAN HAS A LIST OF ALL HIS MISTAKES?
UGHHHH I WONT HAVE 25 DOLLAES TIL MONDAYYYYY HOW COULD U DO THIS TO ME THOMAS
I love this so much 🖤💖
IS HE GAAAAAAAAY (ofc he's gay!) OR EUROPEAN!!!!
ITS THE YEARNING FOR ME
Virgils purple eyeshadow *lenny face*
Okay so like- Is anyone else crying- I LITERALLY DON’T KNOW WHY I’M CRYING- THIS IS JUST SO MANY MOODS IN ONE AND ITS SO WHOLESOME BUT IT HAS SO MUCH SECOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT- 😭😂💖 This is amazing-
this would be the great beginning to a fluffy gay podcast<3
HIS EYESHADOW AT THE END!!! Wihksugneoshfvdkacudjwbtksishc
I fricken CRIED!
I have a MASSIVE crush on Thomas.  So handsome and cute, extremely talented, kind, caring and just so amazing
Wait Virgil eyeshadow changes when he happy?or excited or flustered SOOOO CUTE
when virgil looked at Roman then pushed thomas I literally cannot function
Hey um this is gonna get buried in the uhh 9k comments but this I uh This was important to me. In ways that will be oversharing if I delved into them. But the fear is so relatable that I assumed from the get-go that this will have the obvious bad end because it typically does. Not every Romeo carries a pride pin. Not every Prince Charming feels approachable. They just get piled along with the rest of the self-hating mess-ups you don't get to forget about late at night when you feel like your bed's too big; when you feel hollowed out and want someone there to spoon you. Someone to look at as they rest beside you. Someone that makes you feel wanted and loved in ways that your family just... couldn't do.  Quarantine makes meeting people Non-existent. So you don't get chances to try to be less alone. Less cocooned by... deafening nothing. Nothing and a lot of gay art on your Twitter tl.  Idk, I guess seeing a good script/outcome of a nightmarishly self-defeating situation meant a lot to me right now. ..thank you, from a tiny country that has a ways to go before I could stop someone on the street and compliment them. That will take time. But this might make the waiting period more bearable.  So yeah, thanks begaydoarson
he failed the test      he failed the vibe check
Okay but Virgil's eyeshadow changing from black to purple when he gets anxious or excited is such a nice detail
only a small part but ooooo virgils eyeshadow
HES BACK!
18:58 dude I think you just explained my life.
THE AMOUNT OF EMOTIONS I JUST WENT THROUGH IM- ME AND ROMAN WE'RE JUST SCREAMING TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME AND I REGRET NOTHING
"You're a creep... you're a weirdo... what the hell are we doing here?" I LOVED THAT
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH OMG I REALLY WANT THE REAL LIFE VERSIONN
I love how the comments section is basically a gaggle of gays freaking out and giving each other advice-
I can’t unsee micheal.... from be more chill... anyone else just see micheal?
UGH YES I NEEDED THAT SO MUCH RN AND YESYESYESYEYSEYES   VIRGIL IS SO PRECIOUS WHAT THE HECC
Hm yes
Did anyone notice that virgil’s eyeshadow changed in the end when he was exited?
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW VIRGIL BASICALLY TOLD HIM TO HAPPY STIM AT THE END 🥺
I had no motivation to wake up today but then my brain went "the Sanders sides video was supposed to be released this morning and it's noon" I fell out of my bed looking for my phone after that.
I didn’t get the notification 😭😭😭
Omg deceit has a patreon
PURPLE EYESHADOW I SEE OMG OMGOMHOMGGG IMMA TALK BOUT THIS FOR EVER I LOVE YOUUU ❤️❤️❤️
I wasn't going to do patreon but the janus I can't just not
It was so cute. I loved it.
This video was great!!  Having Roman and Virgil sort of teaming up sort of not in an animatic form was so cute and wholesome!
Honestly feels like a slow burn. But I love it. 💖💜💙
*when Virgil's eyeshadow reverts back at **23:00** and **24:00* Amazing make-up work guys!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNED PURPLE WHEN HE WAS EXCITED HOLY **** THAT WAS SO CUTE AND IT TURNED BACK WHEN REALITY HIT WHAT A NICE TOUCH OMG
This was so relatable it physically hurt.............
YOOOOOO POG
YASSSSSS
Does anyone else notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing around the end? My brother said they might be tied to his emotions which is a good idea.
I NEED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THIS! Did anyone else see that Virgils eyeliner was purple instead of black at the end! But turned black for a second when he was anxious/ Thomas was overthinking?!!!
DID SOMEONE NOTICE HOW VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGED?!?
why was this video uploaded exactly when i started thinking about this topic  *sanders are you psychic*
*”Well... let’s not waste this one.”*  I *SQUEALED*
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay" One of my favorite Roman quotes 😆
This is adorable I love this!!!
DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW HAS PURPLE HIGHLIGHTS?!!!! AND THEN WHEN HES BACK TO HIS ANXIOUS SELF ITS BACK TO BLACK?!!!! ANYONE???!!!
Anyone notice when Thomas is speaking from the heart(aka Patton), Virgil’s voice mixes in a bit?
wait why is it called sanders asides?
Does that mean we have to pay to see bloopers content now? That kinda sucks but I'm not gonna be mean cuz that would be rude, loved the video Thomas!!!!
The "DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX" at the end is such a mood to me- This is the first time I've been early to a Sanders Sides related video, and I will not shut up about it for the rest of the day. XD
@4:38 this whole skit reminds me of a certain Legally Blonde Musical song.  “THERE! RIGHT THERE!”👀
OMFG THE MAKE UP OMFG THE EVERYTHING OMFG, Thomas, if you did actually met a nice guy I am SO happy for you! <3
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!! <3
Does Thomas actually ship his sides!?  If so.....                  Roman x Virgil all the way
yo is this prinxiety
WHATE I SAW ROMAN AND VERGLE BLUSH IS PRINSITY CANNO!?!
Any one else notice that in the end card Virgil's eyeshadow kept switching between black and purple? Let the fan theories comence!
Virgils eyeshadow kept changing!? Anyone else catch that?
Omg this is cutee
👀 👄 woah
Yooooo
WAIT VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGING WITH HIS EMOTIONS
Yay!!! New Episode
In all honesty-- this is the best thing to have ever been released 3 days before my birthday. Its so cute im shaking-
AH FINALLY
This came at the perfect time for me and I don't like it.
Dude. This is my fav sanders sides so far. It was so sweet!!!
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay" Wow, that hurt my feelings. I can't tell you how much I relate to Virgil. This was adorable. Thanks Thomas, much love to you and hope you are well! <3
Lol loved it tho I was wondering when there will be more enamel pins I like to get the snakey boo and the trash duke
Hey!                                 I new shirt
Okey but this is just cute
The amount of second hand embarrassment I felt while watching was astronomical! Love the video! Never realized I also express myself via pins on my backpack as a a way to avoid expressing myself out loud till now. Never dated and also close to 30 years old so this hit pretty close to home.
This episode could have just been titled, "Gay Panic." Also Virgil's eyeshadow was having a time at the end
AHHHH THIS WAS AMAZING 😆😆❤
I really love the purple eyeshadow
"For a pessimist, I'm pretty optimistic" "Your schnoz, search for treasure for good measure"  Am I the only one who got a kick out of these lines? lol
Im only here for bby virgil               Also the new episode got me all exited
I’m ready to learn more about whatever this purple eyeshadow means!
The prinxiety stans:  MY TIME HAS COME      Me, who is tired of prinxiety flooding every fanfic I read: yay.
I love that ☺️
The shifting eyeshadow at the end is awesome 🙌🏻
10:07 WAS AMAZING!! I love MCR!!!! Plus the merch is super cute!!
My favorite episode was Accepting Anxiety 1/2, but this one stole first place without hesitation!
at 8:42 Roman rly said uwu but make it gayer
My friend sent this to me and I'm supposed to be doing overdue schoolwork, but screw it. This is more important. I have no regrets.
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW WAS *PURPLE* IN THE END CLIP??? IM SORRY WHAT???
YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
22:34 VIRGIL SWITCHED HIS EYE SHADOW!!!! : )
VIRGILS EYESHADOW GOES FROM PURPLE TO BLACK WAIY
This was so freaking cute omg
I’m confused is nico the ex from moving on or is he in the present storyline now and Thomas will bring him up in the next sanders sides?
So does this take place after POF...? Hmm.
"He's in his thirties, he might as well be sixty" As somebody who is the same age as Thomas (almost exactly), ouch man, that stings!
I'm in love with the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow depicts his feelings, and that more color is like a more positive light for him  I would also love to see this in live action, as well as more of these animatic pieces. I want both!!!
So um, As an emotional person, I started crying it was so adorable
Are we not going to talk about how virgil’s eyeshadow is bright and purple when he’s excited and talking about the guy they met?? Then it goes back to dark when he starts worrying!??
thomas litterally pulling my little gay lonely heart to the verge of tears TvT rainbow tears TAT
I just gotta say..... I FELT THIS MOOD H A R D
Awwwwwwww i loved it!!! was this based off a real live date?? The animatic worked so incredibly well and was super entertaining to watch!😍 also as someone with a lot of fandom shirts and a good few buttons : every piece of merch i wear is an invitation to talk about that fandom if you know it 😆
Thomas: Top of the morning to ya...  Me: Jacksepticeye reference maybe??
I filmed a reaction video and I swear every single time someone said "lie" I just screamed "Janus!?"
AHHHH THE MAKEUP CHNAGE WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY
I would love to pledge but I don't have any money sorry
10:08 “I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay-“ Lakoitksbdmn yessssss more band references OMGee
Could it be that Virgils eye Shadow becommes purple wen he is Happy because in the scenes were virgil looks Happy is eye Shadow is purple
I'm literally crying
this was the cutest thing i’ve seen
EYE SHADOW!!!! Also, Roman's more chill about Janus??? Not execively, but what? AND VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW GETS LIGTER/MORE VIBRANT WHEN HE'S HAPPIER/GAYER (both types of gay) SO GET OUT YOUR JOURNALS AND START THEORIZING! WOOOOO!
TOMAS ON A DATE????
SOO CUTEEE
virgil  + flirting  =  gay panic
Are we just going to ignore how when Virgil said your making a mistake and Romans response was I’ll add it to the list 😐 the heck Thomas 😢
7:24 THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE!!!! YUGIOH!!!
Can virgil be MY wingman cause I've had no luck in my 17 (soon to be 18) years of living 😀
So are we gonna ignore the fact that at the end Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black?
does Virgil's eyeshadow turn bright purple when he's happy?????
This just screams Roman x Virgil
THIS WAS SO PERFECT ESPECIALLY THE END I SWEAR IF THERES MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS TO COME I CANT WAIT ♥❤
19:58 THEY REALLY SAID-
Good luck on your journey of love , Thomas. I hope you find happiness. I actually kinda went though something like this . When I was trying to ask my friend out to see if she would want me as her gf. I did it in the most un- romantic way . ( But she said yes. ) But I was so scared she didn't like me back. ( I handed her a note that asked if she'd be my gf .) Or if she was lesbian.
Roman: you’re gonna have to speak from the heart, Thomas.   commercial break  Swiffer: it’s such a hassle!
Where is Logan and Patton
I'm sad because I can't get the Patreon.
_I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE, GERARD GAY_
The art style is ADORABLE
AAAAAAAAAAA I HAVE ZERO WORDS THIS VIDEO MADE MY WEEK
IM CRYING OVER THE FACT THAT VIRGIL PUSHED HIM FORWARDS SKAJSKAKSKJ THE FUCKING MOM OVERRIDE
PURPLE EYESHADOW VIRGIL
hey could i get a like Thomas? loving ur content, Stay Safe!!! <3
I need someone to freak out with me about Virgil's eyeshadow going bright and sparkly when he's happy oh my gosh I love him
🎶Is he gay or European?🎶
Theory: if the purple eyeshadow is happiness, and black eyeshadow is his regular state/anxiety, and we know that Virgil spends time putting his eyeshadow on and looks in a mirror to put it on, then the eyeshadow changes with his emotions, and he puts on black eyeshadow to hide it. he also switches to darker eyeshadow instead of eyeliner when he starts getting closer to the other sides, thus "at risk" of feeling a lil more than just anxiety
AAAAAAA THIS WAS ALL SO AWESOME AND YOURE ALL SO TALENTED AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE EYESHADOW CHANGING COLORS INSTEAD OF JUST DARKENING AND AAAAAAA
My heart has shipped prinxety again
THE EMO REFERENCES ARE KILLING ME SHDIDBDB xD
Is nobody going to talk about virgil's sparky, purple eyeshadow like??!?! That was the frickin cutest thing. 🥺😂
Anxiety is so cute !!🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
also can we talk about the eyeshadow change when Virgil was excited vs. anxious???
The Prinxiety fans are QUAKING
AHHH NO IM BROKE
I like how Virgil tells Thomas to shake his hands. Since Virgil is happy I think it becomes the idea of happy stims! I shake my hands when im either nervous or happy.
Ohm omg omg omg
Ahhhhh!  My little animator heart is jumping in excitement.  I absolutely adore this so much!!
his...the...EYES. EYESHADOW IHDFHJEGFUYEFG
*g a s p* Is this not only confirmed prinxiety but our king finding potential second king? :0
oh my STARS, RIOT! BABEY LETS GOOOO
Roman: speak from the heart       Patton: what kiddo?
My favorite viner as cartoon!? we'll sign me up my dude!
OKAY BUT VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW AT THE END- HOW IT CHANGED TO PURPLE AND THEN TO BLACK AND I- ORBOWDJOWKS So it’s more purple- like it has colour when he’s positive and black when he be feeling bad-   I love that so much!
My little gay heart was going nuts through this whole video. Gives my lil introvert self hope :')
I been waiting months for this
Okay I love this video, but I’m just sad bc best boi Logan wasn’t here
AHHH i love this so much and I'm glad we can get an ep even in quarantine. Honestly I love both versions but I would love to see more animatic stuff!! This was really cute, i love them drawn, aaaaaahhhhhh
Aweeeeeeeeee
I’m very surprised that deceit was mixing with Virgil,the anxious lies. Lie Lie Lies Lies Liies  Liiiiiiiieeeesssss
PRINXIETY CONFIREMED!!!!!
No one talking about how amazing the art work is like it's so cute
24:04 VIRGIL'S VOICE DID THE DEMON THING AAAAAAAAA
Yooooo 😳😳😳 this was so fucking cute, Thomas Im so proud of you!. Good on you for taking the chance. Rooting for you buddy!, plus the art! 10/10 everyone who worked on this did such an amazing job. I just 😤🙏😍.
SHUT UP, I'M NOT CRYING- YOU'RE CRYING!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW BEING GLITTERY WHEN HE'S EXCITED SO CUTEEEEE
Loved this animatic style! I’m a fan of ABDIllustrates so it was a pleasant surprise to see you collaborate with them!!
Omg yasss well done Thomas you got prinxiety now you just gotta do loficality and demus ahhhhh God I can't wait for them eeeeeeeeek!!!
22:20 for ME ME ME
Virgles eyeshadow is purple and shiny!! Why is no one talking about that!!??
19:58 I see those hearts-
THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE EPISODE
Virgil’s eye shadow is purple!!!! And seeing him exited 🥺🥺
"Pintroverts" Best pun ever!
THE PURP MAN HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW I REPEAT THE BOY HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW I AM T H R I V I N G
Just an idea but could you make a Sanders Sides video where Virgil has a panic attack all the way through, and he tries to hide it, but Logan knows (because considering intelligence, he would know), then have Logan try and hint to the others without outright telling everyone that Virgil’s panicking because he doesn’t want Virgil to think less of him or something? Then no one catches on, so Logan tries to calm Virgil down and eventually succeeds and then they look at each for, like, four seconds as in a “Thank you” and then just continue the episode?   Sorry if this is stupid.
The end with excited Virgil and the purple, I can't - bless <3
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*hears about all the awesome perks of being a patreon* Oh wow that looks awesome I wish I could be a patreon *cries in broke*
OH MY GOODNESS!!!! WHY AM I SO ANGRY AT BOTH ROMAN AND VIRGIL YET ALSO VERY HAPPY FOR THEM??? ALSO WHY WAS VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW PURPLE FOR A SECOND THERE??? I'M SO HAPPY???
AND NICO FLORES! THE HISPANIC REPRESENTATION, THE POETRY AND SONG WRITING! NICO IS ADORABLE
Did anybody else notice that Virgils eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black?
I can not get over the prinxiety fuel in this
ABD OMG IM SO PROUD THIS IS INCREDIBLEEEEEE
I almost choked on my food when I saw that Thomas uploaded, now my anxiety is currently kicking down my door as I'm trying to watch XD
I was smiling the entire time :3
Wow Thomas bold of you to post this right when I came back from a first date. Very bold.
Broooo Virgil's eyeshadow was purple! Heckin theory time!  I think that because Virgil was more relaxed and light hearted he lowkey became an official light side for a moment. Hence there being more purple than black. But after hearing the question "am I ready for this?" He went back to being somewhere between light and dark as he thought more on the question causing his eyeshadow to go back to black!  I might be wrong but I couldn't resist thinking about it, amazing hint to think about and more amazing episode! 👍  Update: I just now realized he was switching between so uh... oops?
Gay panic > calmly introducing yourself = Roman and Virgil
SHDJQJ I HAVE DIED
I just realized that when the fandom does the whole thing with the abbreviations, like PoF and that sort of thing, it's just GoN. Like Hunter x Hunter XD  Edit: lol I was wrong it's fwsa XD
OH MY GOSH THAT WAS SO CUTE
Im losing my mind about this eyeshadow thing
and y'all wonder why some fanders ship Roman and Virgil. I actually kind of see it now, it kind of works
I absolutely love virgil.
This is so bloody cute!
ok but the eyeshadow turning purple when virgil gets flustered??? i absolutely love that SO MUCH
My gay ass watching this and trying to give him advice when I literally can't talk to anyone I find interesting
Awww this made me so happy 😁😁😁😁
I know I probably shouldn't ship Virgil and Roman considering the fact they are imaginary but *I DON'T CARE THEY WERE SO CUTE THIS EPISODE*  i mean, Roman's heart eyes, Virgil's glittery eyeshadow,  the way these animators drew them so cutely
AHHHHHH!!
Virgil's eyeshadow was changing color!? Was I the only one that noticed that and whenever he was frowning it was black and whenever he was smiling it was the purple does eyeshadow like indicate mood now cuz I'm so I'm here for it!
OH MY GOOOOOD YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
I loved it!!!!!♥ it was sooooo cute uwu
prinxiety stans   how're  ya'll feeling
23:10 The little bit if purple sparkle under his eyes!
sHuT uP shut up *SHUT UP* *also can we talk about Virgil’s eyeshadow bro it’s great*
Everyone: talking about the episode   Me:Virgil eyeshadow is purple!
Watching this with my BFF/Crush and she said Thomas is a bean and I said he was the King Bean and she said he was a Queen Bean and I loved it! Thought everyone should know XD
I can’t get the patron 🥺. Rip my chance to get Janus merch and help with scripts
Am I the only one who noticed Virgils eyes changing
IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN
VIRGIL TELLING THOMAS TO HAPPY STIM HAS MY WHOLE HEART
Flirting with Social Anxiety, alternatively called; "How to use eye shadow to leave a cliff hanger."
PURPLE EYE SHADOW PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN VIRGIL'S EXCITED-
Virgil fangirling at the end is my spirit animal
I'm still not sure whether the title means that he has social anxiety and is flirting or that he is flirting WITH social anxiety
Virgil..... still.... called Janus.... Deceit.... Also. Giddy Roman? Giddy Virgil? Giddy Thomas? Yes please Edit: YO VIRGILS EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPYYYYYYY
A nice touch with the difference in Virgil's eye shadow. X3
The fact that Virgils eye shadow changes to purple when he’s excited/happy make me smile.
PURPLE EYESHADOW?! SO FRIKING CUTE! Whata hell does it means?? 7-7
once I saw this is called my friends and yelled " it's gay time peeps! "   ; - ; (( wait- Thomas did this actually happen in real life and yes I am talking about the video :> ))
His undereye shadow is PURPLE when he gets EXCITED!!!!!!!!!??????;?!??!??!
two word summary of this video: gay panic
idk if it was intentional or not, but i like tht virgil's eyeshadow is a nice purple when he got all excited about a potential relationship blooming for Thomas, then it turns his usual black and heavier application when asked if they are "ready for this" showing his anxiety building
Anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow changed color from purple to black then back to purple then black again?
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OKAY I REALLY WANT TO HELP BUT I HAVE NO MONEY UUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!
*spoilers if you're not done* VIRGIL PUSHING THOMAS TO DO IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN I ALMOST CRIED ALSO THE EYE SHADOW WAS SO AMAZING
OHHHHMMMYYYYGGGOOOODDDDD I frickin loved this so much!!!!!! Was this an actual interaction Thomas had tho???
Just saw the beginning, and I already love it.
YES HE POSTED AND ITS SANDER SIDES my heart jumped so bad when I say he posted
Oh my gosh... My heart was literally  racing the entire time
19:54 WAS THAT BLUSH I SAW PRINXIETY IS HAPPENING RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES
I’m sorry I feel like the only reason Virgil and Roman keep on harping not being a liar is because Janus has been accepted and they don’t feel like they can accept it due to the nature of Decit.
I have social anxiety and this was very relatable, even if I see someone I know in public I do the awkward walking around and walking past them thing because I’m too anxious to say hello.
aaaAAAAAAA virgil's eyeshadow changed colour in line with his emotions at the end,,,,,
I am in love with this episode!! I’ve replayed scenes from it multiple times and the animatic from people I love was an amazing surprises!!! Keep up the good work!!!
THOMAS!!!!! OH MY GOODNESS IM FREAKING OUT THIS WAS SO DARN ADORABLE!!!!
Adorable
did anybody else notice Virgil's eyeshadow changing from purple to black, at the ending when they're all freaking out? Any theories as to why that is?  was it intentional? or were some extra clips filmed to make up some time?
*I wish I had money so I could join the patron*
BUT VIRGIL'S EYESHDOW TURNING PURPLE AND GLITTERY WHEN HE'S SO FLUSTERED AND HAPPY IM SOBBING
"That's like Cyber stalking... But real life" "So... Stalking?" "oH YOU'RE RIGHT"  One of the best parts of this 😂
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
I don’t know how to feel, but I do know that gave me anxiety. But the good kind
Real prinxiety at the end ❤💜
This is so good I love it so much ❤
Wow making me cry
This was the cutest thing I've ever seen 😍
OMG MY BABY VIRGIL OSHAKDBSKVSMKD
Gay panic the video
Virgil is literally gay panic(! At The Disco)
Virgil's makeup shifting with his mood was very cute. But also sad when it shifted really dark at the end like the poor boi
Thomas, returns.  All : (Trying not to giggle)    All : (FANGIRLING)
OMG I LOVE NICO!!!
HIS EYESHADOW. YES. IT GETS LIGHTER WHEN HIS MOOD IS LIGHTER. YESSS. Also, Janus Corridor of Rewards? Yes. I really want to sign up, but I'm a young creator, so the chances are pretty low, and the fact that I'm in the UK hinders it too. But-- BUT - - I hope it goes well with you and your Prince Charming, Thomas. You deserve it!
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen 😆❤
I read the title and forgot breath. Edit: HINT. THOMAS SANDERS ARE YOU HINTING PRINXIETY RN.🤩🤩🤩 also why does virgil have light purple eye shadow ???
Virgil and Roman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AGH!!!! 💕
I cannot express how much I needed this in my life
"Nothing but a bruised ego"
This is my life any time I go anywhere I love this. Also Virgil at the end with all of the walk around! Do you new to pee? Shake your hands! Is my constant daily life
THAT WHAT SO SWEET! Deffinetly worth the wait ( well. All your videos are-) And it works so well as an animatic! Well done to all the artists who worked on this aswell, it was amazing!  ,,, i may have been way too close to squealing and was stimming through this alot-  ( iv also just noticed virgils eyeshadow is all glittery when hes happy and hopful thats so c u t e-)
my heart
VIR. GIL. WITH THE PUR. PLE. EYE. SHA. DOW.
Amazing episode but the title definitely gave the wrong idea of what this episode is going to be about lol haha
Yesssss
WHY IS THIS LITERALLY THE MOST WHOLESOME THING I'VE SEEN ALL WEEK?!?! Seriously, I needed this. Thank you, Thomas and everyone who worked on this amazing video!!
OMG PRINXIETY MOMENT! are you going to do some gay "ships" with the sides? please do!
This is sad...i cried...
............Nico di Angelo anyone? Okay I’ll just go
That was so freaking adorable!!!  💞 I had to share it with my friends. They'll love the animation and cute little story as well
I wish - hope it all goes amazingly well - thank you for sharing
...Could be gayer
Just, 22:36 is the definition of gay screaming-
Remember Thomas from vine-
5:00 Paramore, yes.  As a pop-punk kid I approve.  I also really like Virgil’s reaction.
I wanna do it but I can't buy anything °^° I really wanna see it
This was nice, I dunno what it is about it exactly, but this nice. úwù
VIRGIL HAS NEW EYESHADOW!!!!!!! ITS PURPLE!!!!! [1 second later] oh it’s black again…WAIT NEVER MIND ITS-! No nvm…WAIT!!!!!
WHY DOES NICO SOUND LIKE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS FROM THE TWO PRINCES
Sander sides has become fully animated Me: Inevitable
Please tell me this is a true story, but I also kind of hope this isn't a true story because I don't want you to have stuffed yourself in a trash can. But I also really want you to be happy and have a boyfriend.
AHHHHHHHH OMG aim fan-girling so   much!!!!!! PRINXIETY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh how I love this video!
Man, this just made this year 100% better I'm not even joking you.  This was beautifully made, and I love it. I've watched it at least four times now.  Thomas looked so happy at the end it made me want to cry.  Whenever I'm having a bad day I watch your content Thomas and it brightens my day.                             Ok I need to say this at some point: *"Punk...... Lil' punk............................. SO ABOUT THAT PATREON."*
Come💃on🕺shake💃your🕺body💃do🕺that💃conga🕺know💃you🕺cant💃control🕺yourself💃any🕺longer💃🕺💃🕺💃
I just came back from swimming and I-
SOO CUTE!!
"JOIN ME! No thinking." Me, on a daily basis
Did anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow change at the end? It might have just been a bts complication but I think that it’s a clue in to Virgil’s character, Im gonna need to analyze it more though
I LOOOOOOVE THIS IT LITERALLY MADE MY DAY.  (It's been a hard past couple weeks so this made my day)
“Your making a mistake!” “If I am then I’ll add it to the list!”                   *whoa*
Is it weird that I ship two sides of someone's personality?
24:00 Virgil hiss!! 😭🥺
Dude the ending was absolutely PERFECT!!!! I love Thomas Sanders!! 23:01 Also this!! "Oh beautiest bard in the court of food, we just met an amazing dude!!" :DD
OMG I CANNOT.  First of virgil and Roman getting along for the episode omg then the monologue in the bathroom and then the humour. I loved it so much like words cannot describe how much I love it. It tops the accepting anxiety videos in my list of favourites none of the other episodes have ever topped them. And at the end with virgils eyeshadow. It had me burst into tears like the eyeshadow had me sobbing. I loved it ❤💜❤💜❤❤💜💜
*me noticing that virgil's eyebags are purple, then change to black when he started doubting stuff* interesting
I think Roman is doing a little bit better thank goodness! He looked kinda sad in the mirror but after Virgil did that thing and then the whole scene out of animatic with the switching eyeshadow and them being really excited omgomgomg!!!! AAAHHHHH HELP ME I AM JUST SO FREAKING AMAZED AT THIS EPISODE! I especially loved the bit at the end of the animatic with the conversation between Roman and Virgil and Roman put his hand on Virgil's shoulder at the end omg AMAZING! 😊😊😊😊😊
👏
VIRGILS EYESHADOW
I can already see the Prinxiety shippers freaking out 😂
Anyone else notice Virgil’s eyeshadow?!?!?
Omg, Virgil blushing is so Damn CUTE. I LOVE SEEING MY EMO BOY BLUSH, GIVE HIM MORE.
I read Logie instead of Logic in the intro lmao
AAAAAAAA THATS SO CUTE
Not even a prinxiety shipper and here I am telling them to kiss
When the dog barked at the end and Virgil yelled: *”AH, DEMON!”* His voice went all ochoey and demonic 👀  Edit 9 months later: why did my dumbass think it was necessary to comment this and WHY DID I PUT EYEBALLS AT THE END Edit 1 month later: I’m still thinking the same thing from a month ago
THOMAS THIS WAS EPIC!  The exchange between Virgil and Roman at the end is absolutely adorable and wholesome- and Virgil with purple eye shadow?! YES--
I loved this so freaking much oh my god it was so cute and I really did love it as an animatic
THIS IS THE REASON I’M GOING AS VIRGIL FOR HALLOWEEN. THIS IS WHY I AM COMMITTED. YES.
CONGRATS TO ABDILLUSTRATES FOR BEING PART OF THIS AWESOME THING. Of course to the talented Erin Kelly and the sweetest Brei Grace for contributing AWESOMELY to this vid.  (To be honest I just heard Erin and Brei the moment I saw them on screen 0:55. I'm a huge fan for Alex, but I'm excited on what I'll find on their channel if what I saw here was that good)
WHY IS NO ONE COMMENTING ON THE FACT THAT VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS CANGING COLORS
So..I don't know why but at 23:36 the look Virgil give Thomas when he runs back saying he didn't have to pee gives me Jack Sparrow vibes...
Honestly! Virgil screaming is kinda the best thing I heard :,)
All of these song references are amazing
I cannot even begin to explain how much I need this Nico character to be played by Lin-Manuel Miranda when you re-do this video in live action. I just NEED it. So I'm starting a petition, anyone else agrees with me? 💙
I wish I had the money for pledging but I can barely keep myself afloat :) but I will keep watching videos to support that way
Patton x Logan Roman x Virgil
Okay but this entire video made my social anxiety screammm I’m sitting here in pain and fear hdhdgdh
Roman:JOIN ME NO THINKING Haha same
What’s that? Roman and Virgil giving each other meaningful glances??👀
the prinxiety inside of this bus is ASTRANOMICAL
Excited Virgil is my new favorite thing!
I love what you’ve done with Vergils eyeshadow. Specially with it changing colour depending on his mood.
*Prinxiety fans have entered the chat*  The only reason I found out a new episode came out was because of wattpad.
SHINEY PURPLE EYESHADOW!! ...Wait it turned black... VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES ACCORDING TO HOW HE FEELS AAAAAAAAAAAAA-
I SCREEAMMMEDDDD AHHHHH
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Roman: GeRaRd GaY Mcr fandom: Nothing new we knew that-
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH SO ADORABLE
*Roman and Virgil argue like a old married couple, and its adorable*
It could be lies lies lies lies lies, I like this guy... shoot what now
*stares*- GOLD FISH FLAVOUR BLAST IT
Did anyone notice the eyeshadow on Virgil being purple when he was happy?! I'm so happy I'm crying!
GUYS THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES AT 15:49 BROKE MY HEART
"Boiled male carrots" XD
Virgil: its like cyber stalking but in real life roman: soooo stalking? Virgil: *silent confusion* oooooh yea
:D
I'm so happy... Prinxitey confirmed!
Nobody: The Sanders Side's intro: weewakawelawekiwekayEahyEeaAah
19:34 prinxiety 🥺🥺🥺
I love love LOVE This!!! :0 OMG!!! 💕💕💕💕💕
Flirting with Social Anxiety, aka How to make me ship ThomasxNico in less than 20 minutes
😂 “you’re a creep, you’re a weirdo, what the hell are we doing here?”😂
Virgil and Roman are literally my only two moods
That’s it, this is my new favorite video!!
AHH
As I watched this when the cute guy calls Thomas, I was so excited until I accidentally pulled off my earphones and was struggling to plug it back on cuz my hands wouldn't stop shaking 🤣 It took me 7 seconds to put it back on and trust me I thought I was going to have a heart attack from the excitement and anticipation 😂🤣😆
When Roman called Virgil “Emo” it was always to make fun of him, but now he can say it sincerely without Virgil getting offended. Their relationship has grown so much.  Love the attention to detail!
i got social anxiety just WATCHING THIS well done well played imma rewatch it for the next week
Thomas has a boyfriend and Roman and Virgil's ship is sailing further. Amazing!
I had second hand embarrassment literally the entire time I was watching this and I’ve haven’t even tried to flirt with anyone yet.
the second hand embarrassment when that person walked out of the bathroom stall
hi babycakes we missed you    and sanders sides hehhe
MY HEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAARRRRRTTTTTTTTT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This amazing! Congratulations Thomas and everyone that worked on it! I loved it!
Virgil at the end🤣 "I need you to pace"
I love how they foreshadow Thomas thinking about getting a dog
bhdfvgbdfbvgfdhvbfdvbd virgel blushed when roman to touched his shouldeeeeeeer!
Are we just not gonna mention Virgil's makeup???
One of this week's highlights right here 😚👌✨
That moment you spot a cute person   Anxiety and Common Sense (it's really low self-esteem): You are wrong
Virgil having purple eyeshadow? Does that mean Thomas is feeling less anxiety?? Like, it's still there but not as extreme? Or something? Cause it is there it just seems... calmer? I'm sorry I'm trying to put something into words and I'm doing a crap job at it XD
this one really hit me in the feels <3<3<3
im only 6 minutes into the video and ive had to pause it like 20 times cause im laughing too much XD "i dunno plant"  Lol same
Aahhh personification of social anxiety and gay panic at the same time, new boyfriend, and the new eyeshadow look!!!! Amazingggggg
this artstyle kinda reminds me of toh
They're back!!!!!🔥🔥👉🏽👈🏽♥️♥️♥️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW JEHEHEHEGEHHW... ok so. i noticed that when Virgil is feeling happy and all lovey dovey, and not anxiety ridden. his eyeshadow turns more purple! and immediately when something anxious comes up it goes back to black! ugh the detail is immaculate. ❤️💜
I haven't watched the video jet!! But I literally scremed when I found out ABD illustrates was apart of this!🥺 I adore him very much I also screamed when I read the title- OH MY GOD THE EPISPDE WAS SOO GOOD THE PURPLE EYESHADOW YALL
ah that was so cute!! i’ve been having a pretty rough day and this made me smile :) thanks thomas!
thomas are  you gay in real life or in only your videos
I was just watching Prinxiety and decided to come watch some old episodes and found this gem 💎❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
*when the guy was in the bathroom stall*  Me: OH FRICK SOMEONE ACTUALLY HEARD-
ARe WE NoT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GLITTER EYESHADOW??  Positive anxiety =pretty purple. I friggin love it
The switch in Virgil’s eyeshadow from purple to black when he feels positive and negative anxiety is so subtlety perfect I hope it continues!!!
Thomas: posts a video Me: *Lesbian screeching* THE PROTECTOR HAS COME
"I hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay" 😂😂
WE NEED _MORE._ WE NEED MORE _GAYNESS._  WE NEED _KISSING._ WE NEED _EVERYTHING._  im sorry i am at the maximum fangirling
I LOVE VIRGILS NEW EYESHADOW
This is just what I needed. My life has taken a really bad turn lately and this video cheered me up so much. Thank you so much, Thomas <3 (also purple eyeshadow on Virgil??? LOVE IT!!)
Virgil's eyeshadow!!!! his eyeshadow!!! lol... This is my first time commenting on your vid Thomas, but... I didn't want to lose the opportunity to say thank you for all the hard work you and your AMAZING team build to make this vid! and thank you for being the best person you can ever be! ik it's hard with what's going on right now, but thank you, you and your friends really make us all happy! Thank you so so so much Thomas! I hope you have an amazing day! :') *inserts a million of hearts*
Bro what is with me and missing episodes- With PoF I was forced to watch our mom's belt ceremony And now I overslept by like 3 hours, making me not be able to watch it with my friends-
Virgil switching between black and purple eyeshadow!!!!! AHHHH
Virgil and Roman: lowkey flirting   Me: NOW KITH 😽
Awww!!
Last aside there was Rico, and in this one it’s Nico- thats gonna get confusing
Did anyone else notice Virgil's change in eye shadow around the end? Whenever he was exited/flustered it was a sparkling purple, but when he went back to his usual, more dull mood it was matte black. Idk I could be overthinking this but I thought it was a nice detail. 😁
I can't believe Thomas called me out for my laptop stickers
Did anyone else notice Virgil's eye shadow turning purple to black
Is Nico voiced by Joan or am i just stoopid?
Im in tears- this was pawesome and now pawssibly my favourite episode now you clawed your way to victory and met a nice snazzy cat or pupper
I spent that entire episode screaming "JUST TALK TO HIM!!! THE PINS ARE THE ICREBREAKER!!!" and that's how I know Roman is my favorite Side.
This made me cry
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii I CAN'T
HAPPY VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!
Virgil and Roman for most of the video: Liar
Omg the gay yearning the gay panic i'm crying so much
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT VIRGILS PURPLE MAKEUP?!?!?!?! HE LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!
Anyone else notice that Virgil's eyeshadow color changes to purple when he's excited or happy and it's the cutest thing oml!
Roman: Thomas- you're going to have to try..... speaking from the heart. Me: patton?
Nobody else noticed Virgil's eyeshadow were purple 22:54      But then did they turn black again  22:59?  :0
*large intake of air* (#1.) OMG THUS TOTALLY NEEDS A LIVE ACTION VERSION!!!! 😍😍😍😍  (#2.) 🎶Thomas in the bathroom!🎶😅  (#3.) VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜😍😍😍😍😍
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  I LOVE IT!!!!!
Roman: touches Virgil's shoulder Me: I SHIP IT   Me also: Thomas teach me how to flirt😅
My little gay heart is quaking
Welp, Thomas’s patreon is gonna be on my Christmas wishlist :3
I JUST DROPPED EVERYTHING, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING MY DAILY SEROTONIN
VIRGILS EYE SHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY!!!!! FANGIRL OVERLOAD I REPEAT FANGIRL OVERLOAD!!!!! ITS A CATAGORY NINE!!!!
I really ship Virgil and Roman. Virgil cares so much for him and Roman is always trying to help Virgil
Omg i love this video so much my heart cant take it ❤   Virgil at the end when he pushed Tomas into talking to him was cute  Then virgil and roman made flirty eyes at eachother when it worked out. Your content is amazing!
Sparkly Virgil makes me giggle
Gay Panic: The Video
alright-     what are gay eyes?
I LOVE THIS SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!
“Is that fair to him?” BRUH VIRGIL MY GUY ARE C O N C E R N E D ABOUT OUR BOY JANUS
Oh my goodness, this episode was everything. Thank you so much Thomas, the artists, and the team for this amazing work. I felt the energy radiating off of every line!!
Sander Sides fans when they see this finally out: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!
Did anyone else notice the fact the Virgil kept switching back and forth between purple and black eyeshadow??
This was so fricking cute i just wish i had a patreon and i cant wait for the live action episode, i also love the fact that when virgil gets really happy his eyeshadow takes a lighter color, but dang this was too cute
THAT’S.NICO.
The title had me thinking of a whole different scenario...
Hii, hello- another comment- because I'm like that and can't keep my mouth shut- THE. PURPLE. EYESHADOW. Yes, yes, and yes. Love it and I hope we see it more often 💜
me, aromantic, watching this and trying to figure out what theyre talking about: 👁👄👁
6:54 I don’t belong here!!!
I think Virgil probably also represents excitement, not just anxiety. If anxiety is negative stress, after all, then excitement is positive stress.
This entire episode is just Princexiety
Don't we all just love how this episode is pretty much just prinaxity at its finest
"Dude it's okay, that happens 30 times a day. Please relax." If this line isn't in the new merch, I will be extremely disappointed.
OH MY GOOOOOD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH  This might be my favorite Sander Sides so far!! And as a bonus one of my very favorite artists worked on it!! I AM LOSING MY GAY LITTLE MIND HERE
Am I the only one who heard the Hamilton reference?   *rISE TO THE OCCASION!*
omg the way that Virgil screamed at the end was amazing!!!!!!!!!!! i could see a little bit of sandership at the end all and all good work you guys you did a really good job!!!!!!
Me + faster = Impossible
Now we're all left wondering if that was something that actually happened          I'm sad but that was adorable
Finally it's here yaya!
The dog just wants to play 🙄
Roman's affectionate "Shut up emo," was just... just...  *Screaming in happy fanenby"
did i cry when they said to speak from the heart? yes. did i cry even harder when i realized that patton wasn't going to be in the episode. also yes. so then, dear thomas, where was your heart if not with you? was he, perhaps, being overshadowing by all the lies? (also, JOAN :D)
I love everything about this!
Is it just me or in the end card Virgil's eyeshadow turned purple?
You make this look easy. I dont even have enough strength to look at the man!!
Ahhhhhhhh the purple eye shadow!!!! Yas virgil! I love it this is amazing!!!!!@
Pov: your looking thru the comments not knowing what to type 😀
OMG I LOVED THIS SOOO MUCH!!!!!! As a broke college student I am DEVASTED that I can't afford the patreon, thank you so much for your wonderful content!!!
love how virgils eyeshadow keeps changing colours lmaoo
22:42 Do... Do Anxiety's eyeshadows turn sparkly purple when he is happy/excited...?
Virgil: I’m gonna need you to start waving your hands.   Me: *starts reflexively happy flapping*
Logan should’ve come in yelling “FALSEHOOD”
19:51  I SHIP IT I SHIP ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
My gay dad found another gay dad! 🏳️‍🌈 YAY This animatic must have taken forever cause I did my first animation and that took forever!
Anyone else see that the limited patrons are gone
Is no one gonna talk about when Virgil got excited the under eye shadow turned purple because I LOVE that!!!
At first i though that this episode will be flirthing whit virgil for some reson Lmao
Wow 😲 so many likes in 2 hours !
THERE IS NO BETTER FEELING THAN THOMAS UPLOADING
Prinxiety is real!!!!!!
So are we just going to ignore Virgil’s eyeshadow colors?!?!?!
Me after saying one word to someone in public: Go home and regret everything.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Y E SSSSSS YOU'RE BACK OWO
Virgil's eyeshadow went purple when he was happy! Awww
OMG, he stood in a line to a carrot stand! He hates carrots!
Two big theories of mine!! (Yes I took the time to write these out with time stamps)  The eyeshadow theory: At the very end of the episode when Thomas, Virgil, and Roman are freaking out because they talked to the guy at the mall Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing colors from Purple to Black and kept going back and forth. I believe this was because of Thomas’ emotions. When Thomas was happy and not anxious Virgil’s eyeshadow was purple, when Thomas was anxious and not very happy then Virgil’s eyeshadow was black. At 22:35, the very beginning of them freaking out where they are all covering their mouths, smiling a lot and hyperventilating Virgil’s eyeshadow is purple. Then at 22:59 after Thomas reads them the tweet the eyeshadow goes black as Thomas gets anxious because the tweet was.. not good. Then at 23:11 after Virgil smiled while Roman was doing “poetry” it goes Purple again as they get excited when Virgil states “what if things are never the same again”. Then at 23:53 Thomas states “are we ready for this?” The eyeshadow starts easing into black. Then by the next clip of Virgil at 24:01 it’s fully black as they all start getting anxious again   The first move theory: Okay so we all know Virgil made the first move but why? It was because Roman was upset. Virgil didn’t even look at Thomas. He was glancing at the ground and then looked up at Roman then without even liking at Thomas Virgil made the decision to push Thomas to the guy because it made Roman happy. Virgil made a decision that he himself wasn’t even ready for because it made Roman happy. At 17:09 Roman sighs making Virgil glance right from the ground over to him, he then looks at the guy walking away, NOT THOMAS, you can tell this because Thomas is out of focus. At 17:13 he then glanced back at Roman and sees him very upset at 17:19 he starts breathing heavily and then decides to push Thomas to the guy. At 19:40 when Roman says thank you Virgil tried to play it off like it was nothing then at 19:50 when Roman puts his hand on Virgil’s shoulder and tells him “bravery” Virgil gets all choked up until roman tells him to “shut up emo” and then Virgil smiles.
Was it just me, or did something about this episode seem a little deja-vu-y? There are certain lines that i swear I've heard before...
19:56 THE WAY ROMAN SAYS IT VIRGIL THOUGH AND VIRGIL BE BLUSHIN
1. I started to cry at the end❤ And 2. This video just makes me even more happy about future prinxity moments! 😢🏳️‍🌈
I love this so much, at the end with Virgil and Roman it's so wholesome, and I loved when he said "Shut up, emo"         BHUHDVGYUVFEBUHVFBIFVVGUFYUVW my heartttt <3
Did he finally get a boyf reind?
Roman is just- himbo. Full freaking himbo.
I love virgil's new eyeshadow
Tristeza q é em dólar :( Dólar, pq tão alto?!
Roman: **makes MCR joke and nickname**  All emo fans: **screeches in emo**
That was so beautiful I also thought roman was gonna kiss virgil QwQ
Roman “Gay Eyes” Sanders
I'm crying!!!!
Awwwww
16:08 Gay panics: WANNA SEE SOME REAL SPEED BI—
but thomas, is that a situation that actually happened? are you and nico still talking? because i stan
I NEED TO GET A JOB I WANNA SUPPORT YOU MY FIRST PAYCHECK IS GOING TO THE PATREON!!
i read the title at first as 'flirting *to* social anxiety' not 'flirting *along with* social anxiety' and thought it was going to be roman and virgil flirting with each other
"That's the most introverted way to talk about yourself without having to do something too extreme....like talking"😂 I feel called out😂😅❤
I bet u won't start a conversation with me >:)
I.....                                                        I've NEVER seen Virgil so very......happy before, I mean I've seen him happy before but not THIS happy, and does the purple eyeshadow mean that he's not being angsty or...something else....huh very interesting....
FINALLY A HAPPY ENDING  Thomas is getting what he deserves
This was an entire episode of prinxiety and I love it
AHHH YES 😂 I LOVE IT
This is adorable 🥺, I’ve been waiting for this for so long
Can we PLEASE talk about Virgil's eyeshadow in the end card? I love that it changes when he's happy, that's adorable!!
It’s so fantastic!! And I love Virgils eyeshadow!!! Also GAY EYES!!!
Virgil: SAY IT BACK! Also Virgil: Do you know what that word means to them Thomas!?
YES!!!!!! ABD!  😆
THAT WAS SO SWEET OH MY GOSH MY HEART
Ok ok ok theory time!!  So at the end Virgils eyeshadow was purple but switched to black but back to purple again, maybe it means Virgil is having feelings... whether it be love or just plain happiness, it then turned to black which maybe it was him going back to anxiety, but I am here for happy Virgil AND happy Roman
Genuinely happy/giddy Virgil gives me LIFE!
YESSSSSSSSS THANK YOU MY DAY JUST GOT SO MUCH BETTER!!!
I swear i couldn't stop squealing at the end, this was so relatable and cute!
Where’s my boy Patton
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I love this so much!!!!
Course sometimes it's like 'hey i like you' and they go 'really??? i like you too!' and then you both just sit there for a minute because you never had a plan for how to deal with that. (we do now of course, and that plan is to get married next year, but you know, all things in time)
T h E    e Y e    S h A d O w
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY
The gay couple energy from Roman and Virgil is strong with this episode.
okay but is no one going to talk about the title? thomas did us prinxiety shippers dirty-
YAY! A new sanders sides!!
PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!! <3<3<3
amazing video 😍😍 but is there anyone else who noticed Virgil's eye shadows turning from light purple to dark black after Thomas says "are we ready for this?" and he starts being...you know... paranoid??
OMGGGGGGG. Virgil’s happy eyeshadow is BEAUTIFUL. I love how his emotions are are expressed through that
My heart... I had to stop this vid several times to slap the table, yell at the screen, and laugh so hard I can't breathe.  And that Roman Virgil moments???? Absolutely priceless. Love it so fricken much!!!!  PS and that end card is life! The changeing eyeshadow is a wonderful addition to Virgil's character.  Pps Also good catch on the "animation works for social distancing" thing. I was wondering when someone was going to catch onto that. Been waiting for the uptick in animation since March, lol. It was super sweet!
Did anybody notice that Virgil’s eyeshadow was purple and sparkly when he was excited and turned back to black when he got anxious about the tweet?! It changes like that through the rest of the video!! The detail!! It reminds me of the mad hatter I alive in wonderland how his make up and hair changes based on his emotions.
THE SONG REFERENCES HAVE OFFICIALLY KILLED ME
Are we gonna talk about how Virgil’s eyeshadow kept changing from purple (I’m assuming when he was excited or thinking about Nico) and black (pretty much every time he was thinking about anything else)
Firstly, Thomas how long did it take you to build that Disney Castle in the back?  And Secondly....  VIRGIL WHY IS YOUR EYESHADOW CHANGING COLOR EVERY OTHER SCENCE AT THE END?!  IS THAT A NEW POWER THAT WHEN YOU ARE HAPPY IT TURNS PURPLE?!?!
IKAIEJKEIEJEKR PLEWSEE THIS WAS ADORABLE
HDKDHSKDH THE PURPLE EYESHADOW??????
So there will be no more memberships?
Thomas: this is a key episode to the storyline Everyone: LMAO WHO CARES I WANNA SEE PEOPLE KISS BC UWU SHIPS UWUWUWUWU AND IGNORE THE SHIP BEING SHOWN IN THIS BC UWU PRINXIETY UWUWUWU Edit: Well since I'm apparently famous now with the 245 likes I got ill use my very very big famous celebrity platform to tell yall that NICO NEEDS MORE LOVE SERIOUSLY PEOPLE STOP W THE PRINXIETY FOR A SECOND AND NOTE THAT THOMAS FINALLY GOT SOMEONE LIKE HIM IN HIS LIFE IT'S WHOLESOME WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT THIS ty for reading
I really expected Roman to you know like grab his shoulder then lean forward and kissed him but whatever
6:51 AAAAA THE RAIDOHEAD REFERENCE
Virgil is honestly just a mood lmao
This is causing me anxiety! references aside I KEEP HAVING TO PAUSE EVERY THREE SECONDS BECAUSE IT'S SO AWKWARD HGDJKBF not complaining though, this is  a r t
Omg when Virgil was happy his makeup changed! It looked so good! Hope to see it more often!
19:40 THIS SCENE IS CALLING PRINXIETY!!!!!
This is a true story While watching this,  I dont know what I was playing with, but I looked down I saw that I was covered in rainbow glitter  I dont know where it came from because none of my things have glitter on them but it is covering my entire top and the first thought instantly was  *could be gayer*
Question for Thomas: do you ship any of your character if you do who do you ship?
..possible forshadowing? Yea foreshadowing
I love this episode so much!! This was so worth the wait😁💜
LOVE THIS SO MUCH THOMAS
What is the janes theme name
Finally he upload a video
I cried while watching this. The end was so beautiful I can't
The second hand embarrassment I feel is overwhelming-
So is this you flirting with social anxiety or Roman a Virgil flirting...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT ROMAN SAYING  "Well if it is a mistake, ILL ADD IT TO THE LIST."
My anxiety side just died during this whole ordeal but this is so effing cute omg! I’m adopting Virgil and we will have platonic cuddles!
Did everyone notice that when Anxiety is happy the eyeshadow is a light purple but when he starts getting anxious it goes back to black it might be obvious but I thought it was a really neat detail and by the way I loved this so much it was so cute ❤️❤️
AHHHH I NEEDED THAT CUTENESS AHHHH SOOO ADORABLE AHHH THOMAS U PLAYIN WITH MY HEART AHHHHH
Roman and Virgil in this ep 😂
Aaaaaaahhhhh I love Sanders sides so much I'm so glad there is another episode
THOMAS I WEPT IN FRONT OF MY DOG. How dare you.... but also this made my entire week and you and the team did an amazing job :,)
I wish I could like a video more than once! I love this!!! 💜
Ok but I love that Virgil’s eyeshadow went purple when he was less anxious it’s like my favorite thing
When I say I mad some weird freaking noises watching this I mean that I made some weird freaking noises watching this This is so freaking cute
This video brought me the most joy I’ve felt in a while
Virgil is our gay panic at the everywhere and I simp for it
Oh this was so awkward to watch, but it was so funny.
Prinxiety Shippers are quaking 😂
DOES VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURN PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY?!?!?!?!?!?!
Heh My names nico   <:
thirsty for that new content and that serotonin
Okay but I've never been more sad that I don't have an income so I can pay for patreon :((((
Prinxiety shippers : dying of happiness and commenting  Me:  Virgil eye shadow when he is happy is amazing and I love it!
Love how Virgil’s bags are changing colors along with his mood 💜💜💜💜
I saw the video and yelled "Sanders Sides! Hell Yeah!" Then I saw the thumbnail and I knew the Prinxiety in this was gonna be awesome But can we talk about these comments? Like I LIVE for this stuff lol ~Laura of the Destined Children
23:40 ADHD VIRGIL ADHD VIRGIL
I JUST... This Is Too MucH for me to hAnDle and Im replaying this again and again for two hours and its 1:51am over here!!!!!! MY SEROTONIN AND DOPAMINE ARE JUST TOO HIGH RIGHT NOW
I was not expecting the purple eyeshadow, and once I saw how excited Virgil was I freaking died he’s just so cute and I love the purple eyeshadow, I hope you keep making videos like this and I also love how Virgil and Roman were trying to help Thomas talk to the guy, it was also funny when Virgil brought out the binoculars to look at the laptop and I especially loved when Roman put his hand on Virgil’s shoulder💜❤️ and I hope you keep making videos like this😍🥰
I just wanna say,I've been watching Thomas for 2 years and only now realised I'm not subscribed😔😔 Plus why is no one talking about Virgil's purpled up eye shadow?
HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT IN THE END VIRGILS EYESHADOW COLOR KEPT CHANGING FROM WHEN HE WAS HAPPY TO WHEN ZHE WAS ANXIOUS, LIKE AUDVDNDJUDEBBEVRMDUCI
Purple eye shadow!!!
Guys virgils eye shadow why was it changing is there a reason is it just cuts idk but AHHHHH
This  just supports prinxctey so much
I'm so proud of Virgil I can't even put my feelings into words. This was amazing Thomas xx
Thomas: we have worked to present this episode in the form of an animatic Me: HOLY FREAKIN HELL :D :D :D
Don’t tell me there’s no prinxiety after this episode
OMG DID U SEE VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW ITS SO CUTEEEEE
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how far Roman and Virgils relationship has come.They started out hating each other and now they are fan-girling over cute guys together.
Dear prinxiety shippers,   We’ve won
Is nobody gonna talk about the subtle character growth at the end where Virgil realizes he is ready for a relationship and ready to be accepted? Because *my heart*
HES A TRUE NEUTRAL SIDE HIS EYESHADOW IS BLACK WHEN HES CLOSER TO A DARK SIDE/MORE ANXIOUS AND ITS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY/LESS ANXIOUS JDJDKKFKSJGKZKBFKCGSHSFVY  SOMEOEN PLEAEE SAVE ME IM DIEING
Was that a Hamilton reference 👀
8:32 Imma just save this timestamp. That face lol
I'm CRYIINGGGG THIS IS AMAZING AND I LOVED ITTTTT
This vid is the definition of gay panic 🤣
Virgil with his purple eyeshadow when he’s optimistic/happy kills me 💜💜💜 also just this whole episode!!!
As a bi teen with anxiety, I’m gonna *need* to see a live action interpretation of gay eyes
I love it
THAt WAS AMAZIIIIIIIING!!!!!
I had to wait an hour to watch this thanks to my homophobic stepmom
'shut up emo' felt that..
My prinxiety heart litterally exploded.
Prinxiety tag teaming for a romantic persuit. Love it, and yeah, Being brave is about doing something despite being scared.
Also Virgil,love your new eyeshadow!
Um.. is Roman okay?..  Virgil: You're making a mistake!! Roman: "Then i'll just add it to the list!"
19:59 🥺
Sweet mother of ads! GET YOUR COIN THOMAS!!
Watching this made me so happy. Thank you to all people involved in the creation of this video.
I can smell the awkward
i love this sooooooo much!!!!!
Did- did he lay in the trash can?
The prinxiety is real🥺 Also Thomas is such a nervous gay bean and awwwwwwwwwww❤️
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING WITH HIS MOOD I CAN'T
Yo what's going on with virgils eyeshadow switching colours, is it based on his mood?
I loved this it was amazing
Are we just not gonna talk about Virgil's moment when he just started breathing super heavy then pushed Thomas forward?
Oof. My heart.
Virgil's eyeshadow!!!!
Wait... DECEIT IS CALLED JANIS EXCUSE ME
SHUT UP OMFG AHHHHHHHHHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH
VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!
Virgil's makeup changes when he's excited verses when he isn't!!! AHsndjekslwlwlw!!! Wow!!!!
So when will be the next episode? :))))))
“Okay theatre what is down the where to my what” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THE EYESHADOW ON VIRGIL WHEN HES FREAKIN HAPPY! QHdksbFkkFksbksnbgHkbFd
Also awesome video, it's amazing, I love the fact y'all drew it- the creativity/my creativity(Echo) is giggling with joy- we love it
8:33  Roman: =3c
Bro I literally got dumped by my boyfriend today and to see the new episode of Sanders Asides be about love is just something else. Good episode either way!!!!
the prinxiety fandom is so starved and desperate that we're freaking out over roman touching virgil's shoulder
can we talk about janus runing thomas's patreon and the potential that has ?
Ah I feel seen. I have such panic while talking to people and I completely over  think situations or my own actions. I have also missed so many opportunities because I just could not muster the courage to talk with people.
At the end when Virgil and Roman touch Me: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
AMAZING, GREAT, GAY, GREAT GAY! YES I LOVE THIS! YES!
PLEASE TELL ME HE HAS A REAL BOYFRIEND
The snake bashing was so real it hurts. ;-;
wait... guys can you hear that? it sounds like.... like distant screaming.... of joy.... oh wait it’s just the prinxiety shippers nvm carry on
OMG VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW NEARER THE END I LOVE IT
Thomas you wholesome angel!!!!          That was weird I'm sorry
This was awsomeeee!!!!!!! It reminds me of my social anxiety👏👏👏👏❤️
Why is no one talking about Virgil’s eye shadow?? Like not only is it so well done and pretty but the changes in color that coordinate with Virgil’s mood/demeanor!! The details are just *chef’s kiss* beautiful.
God filley he make other video I been waiting 8ye for he make other video.
VIRGILS MAKEUP TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY AND EXCITED OMGGGGGG
Congrats tomas for getting over that axienty! Also THE SHIP IS PURE THE SHIP IS PUUUURRRREEE
All I can say in response to this video is:      *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA* ONCE I GET A JOB IM DEFINITELY PAYING FOR A PATRON TIER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕
This is so me when I met a cute girl. But at the same time he could have just gone up to him and talk about one of the pins/stickers he liked
17:16 Breaking through that barrier of anxiety to embark further with confidence.
Hay thomas  Due to some problems in my fam i can't really support on patreon or youtube members or bye any merch but il try to support in any way i can   Love you and stay safe❤❤❤
I have two simple questions: 1: is this a real relationship? 2: is prinxiety real?!
OMG OMG OMG- IS THOMAS GETTING A BOYFRIEND! DUDE I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!! THAT'S SO COOL!
Omg I'm crying at gay eyes for how many times me and my friends have talked about the lesbian stare...
IM SCREAMINGNGGGG I LOVED THIS
Not me waiting for Patton to show up when he said to talk from the heart-
Wait... WHY IS THIS ME THOUGH? I feel attracted and exposed 😂🤣
I near cried when Roman said "Add it to the list" when Virgil was talking about Roman making a mistake. But I love this video so much
*how "Gay Eyes" is used in the situation *    Me: huh so that's the name for it. Guess I'll remember that when I go to work 💕💯
Did anyone notice at the end when anxiety was happy his eyeshadow was purple and when something anxiety inducing happened it turned black again ?
i love how Virgil eyeshadow was just changing from black to purple at the end-
"Will Deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems? Is that fair to him?" Woah. Is Virgil saying here that using Deceit to solve all of Thomas' problems isn't fair to Janus?
subtitles?
IM SO HAPPY
Awwww this really is 1 of my favourite or should I say more relatable Sanders Sides episodes! Also that Prinxiety moment 😻❤
Virgil and Roman are kind of an unstoppable force and ultimate comedic duo
God, my Prinxiety heart
Will "shut up emo" be their "always"??
I clicked on the video but I remembered I have to wait for my sister so we can watch together. Love you Thomas. I’ll see you later😥
........Why can you only pay with credit card or PayPal on patreon..........the extended videos😭 I wanna see them.......
I'M SCREAMING THIS WAS SO GOOD
We love a bit of gay
WAIT IS THIS REAL OR IS THIS FICTIONAL BECAUSE IF IT'S REAL, I SHIP YOU GUYS AND IF IT'S FAKE, I SHIP YOU GUYS
Virgil stims!!
7:47 thE CARROTS OH NOO XDD
I am so sorry for everyone in this house, I'm just a sucker for romance and I cant stop screeching and shaking my hands and bouncing and OMG my heart 🖤 I hope this happen(d/s) to the real Thomas as well
The purple eyeshadow instead of the usual black when Virgil is optimistic! And the way it switches back and forth when he does get anxious!!! Ahhhhhh!!!!!
I love you guys :)
I wasn’t expecting a Sanders Sides to be posted rn but OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH THOMAS AND EVERYONE ELSE I NEEDED THISSSS😍😍
Virgils eyeshadow kept changing
I am crying. This is soo amazing and cute and...I guess that hit close to home... But really, great work y'all! :)
Me: haha, I'm in shipping danger-
IM TOTALLY FANGIRLING!!!!! I WANNA SEEEEEE THIIIIIIISSSSSS!!!
:)💞
i cannot stop watching the end card oh my gosh
Oh my God this was so cute I'm going to combust. The fact that roman and virgil seem like such opposing forces to thomas and each other but in the end always want the best for him is a great clarification of their characters!
So now that one tiktoker can stop doing the suit & tie dance
Excited Virgil with purple under eyeshadow aaaaaa that's so cute!!
😭❤
OK I LOVE THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW
It's like they don't get along unless they're Ganging up on Thomas LOL 🤣😂
you make me cry thats amazing
4:20 this scene I feel personally called out with a specific dude at my school
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH My heart breaks
This was sooo cute, I love this!
So. FrEaKiNG. WHOLESOME.  And Roman calling Virgil "Gerard Gay" made my day for some reason. Heckers, this whole video made my day! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
When i saw that the episode was posted, I literally started screaming :)
The gayness gives me POWERRR
nothing has related to me more than "what are you doing!?" "ion know, plant"
I was ASLEEP how is it out already?!?!?!?!?!?!??
Love getting second hand anxiety from an animatic
WHEN VIRGIL GETS EXCITED IN THE REAL PART HIS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE AAAAA
"You're making a mistake" "If I am, I'll add it to the list" ... jesus christ, Roman, do you need to talk?
So cute qwq
Sorry I’m late, I’ve been sitting in the corner of my room wheezing after I read the title
Loved this so much! The art was cute, the story was great and the ending (both animated and in his apartment) was adorable. Keep up the great work! ❤
Okay, this is NOTHING like what I was expecting. It was so much more!! I'm so filled with euphoria right now. The entire episode had me smiling, freaking out, crying, just all the emotions. AND THE PRINXIETY? I'm screaming. I love this episode so much!
I love how Virgil's eyeshadow changes! It so cute!
“i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay”
I relate to this, also, this may have given me like, a lil anxiety while watching this, only because I saw ME doing this lol  Edit: IM CRYING THIS IS BEAUTIFUL AHHHHHHHH
omg this is so cute and funny...i want to know what happen next between thomas and nico lol
omg I've been waiting for too long for them to work togheter, I'm soooooooooooo happy!! I need to do someting with my hands now!!!
The Wattpad writes itself  Edit: IS ANYONE GOING TO POINT OUT VIRGIL'S makeup!! *chefs kiss*
Virgil’s eyeshadow? CHARACTER ARC???!?!!!!!?
*_THAT PRINXIETY HIT HARD ON THE HEART-_*
This is like a movie it cute 😖
YYAYAYYYAYAYAYAYAH HES IN LOVE!!!! SHIP!!!! I HOPE THIS ISNT A FICTIONAL WORK!!! SHIP! SHIP! SHIP!!!!!!!
The amount of emo puns here tho,  I AM THRIVING  "For a pessimist, I'm pretty optimistic" "We can live like Jack and Sally if we want" "I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard GAY"  *chefs kiss*
This whole video was gay panic
Ok but who else really wants to hear that song?
17:15
So wait when Virgil is happy does that turn his eyeshadow purple?
It´s just me or it looks like Virgil and Roman made a team to mess with Thomas? xdxd
OKAY SO Regular Anxiety has dark eyeshadow Bitchy Anxiety has eyeliner & THRILLED Anxiety has PURPLE eyeshadow SO cute
Omg this was the best video ever!!!!
“I’d hate to rain on your Black Parade,Gerard Gay” might be my new favorite quote and can it please be put on a t-shirt.
"No, I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking."
I love the new eyeshadow! It looks so good on Virgil
23:24 Roman: "JOIN ME! No thinking!" Logan:
Virgil: hide!!  Thomas: into the garbage!!!!  Me: mood.
"I don't know... plant"  That was cute
I dunno that's pretty gay if you ask me
I loved this you should make this into a Sanders Sides episode    I am going to watch this for the rest of my life
Um.... virgils makeup! Hello???
🥺🥺🥺
Virgil's eyeshadow when he's excited omg :D
NEW VIDEO NEW VIDEO NEW VIDEO NEW VIDEO AAAAAA
Roman: If he’s ready, we’re ready! Virgil: *going into angst* Dog: OH HELL NAH
Virgils eyeshadow!
Best sander sides video EVER!!
This episode made me cry because it just reminds me that to people you meet you would get the feeling if you’re gay he’ll feel it he felt love and happiness I tried to date someone but it hurts my heart to say this but just in excepting me for who I am I just wish that I was who is one of the presents to say something about suffering without them but didn’t listen to me I hope you respond to this Thomas because I really need someone to talk to you now because I can’t stop singing then your episodes would be happier that’s why if you get the chance to respond this can I have a rainbow hoodie because it’s almost my birthday and I don’t want to be rude or anything but I hope you answer this
Did I just see Virgil in purple eye shadow!!!!
“What are you doing?” “I don’t know....plant.”  THOMAS SOUNDS SO ADORABLE HERE AHHHH
My anxiety is thinking after watching this video “wow i wish we could be that happy“ TvT
My emotions 📈📈📈📈📈📈
Am I the only one?     Or, like, do you guys get anxious when other people are going to embarrass themselves? Like, I have this sinking feeling in my gut, and it just tells me to ABORT so I cant see it.
is that a bit of purple in virgil's eyeshadow?
sigh if only you were a lesbian then you could start playing girl in red just loud enough for the other person to hear
..............welp, Virgil is me. Everything Virgil did in this episode is me every time I find a cute girl. In all honesty, this series has helped me a lot in figuring out who I am. Helped me a lot with the struggles that I have in my life. So I just want to say, thank you Thomas and the sanders sides team. Thank you for, all that you have done.  P.S. Love the animation, wish I had money to support your patreon. Anyone noticed Virgil's purple eye-shadow?
"Will deceit continue to be the answer to your problems? is that fair to him?"  I JUST REALISED WHAT A SUBTLE HINT TO VIRGIL'S FEELINGS ABOUT JANUS’ ACCEPTANCE THIS IS
I feel the need to respond to the last question of the end credits to give some sort of reassurance to our baby virgil, is that you never know until you try.  I like to think there's is nothing in life you are truly prepared for. No one is truly ever ready for what life throws at us.  Be it, a new relationship or a new career, or even a newborn child.  We just have to brace ourselves for what's to come and learn to have faith in the journey.
i think Virgil literally turned into the embodiment of Gay Panic himself
*Almost everything said in this needs to be on T-shirts*
WAS ANYONE ELSE FAN GIRLING/BOYING WHEN A HINT OF PRINXIETY AT THE END OF THE ANIMATION?!!
This epsiode is the most relatable episode for me I've ever watched! xD It's me anytime I see a cute guy, a cool person with pins and or something I like like merch and what not and I wanna talk to them but I'm like "Nah I shouldn't" or "It'll be awkward afterwards" Yet I still try and grab their attention by revealing the merch I may be wearing or say something about something we may have in common. Does it ever work? NO! T-T xD
That was so cute!! 🤣(⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)
Omgogmogm sooo cute I loved all of this, now how do I overcome my social anxiety so I can talk to a cute girl lol
YOU DIDNT PULL AT THOMAS’S HEART STRINGS *sniffle*  YOU PULLED ON MINE, DUM DUMS😫😫😫😫
I have been waiting for this moment for so long!
Happy and less anxious virge
Can you PLEASE make a real life version of this?!
Virgil's new purple eyeshadow, amazing, yes PERFECT!!  We need that from new on.
This is the most perfect thing i have ever seen 😃😃
"Oh beauteous bard in the court of food, Yes I had a gay panic because of that dude"  Filled it in lol-
My prinxiety heart just exploded 💜❤️💜❤️
Me ThiNkiNg: *Lies - Deceit* *Heart - Patton*
I can't tell you how much I relate to this video. Great job as always guys! And it's great to see some of my fav channels get involved with this one!!!
I screamed and woke up my little sister, this episode was my happy of the day.
I'm getting anxiety just watching this, but I also think it's funny. I'm smiling and cringing at the same time......I'm Sminging.....Criling??
OH MY GOTH THE LINE, "HE FEARS THINGS TOO" KILLED ME  ALSO VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW IS JUST AMAZING
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS
Today is World Mental Health day     Just putting that out there          I feel bad for the guy in the bathroom
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.     YES.
Oh my gosh his eyeshadow!!!!!!
Okay but why did Roman said fib-uary
I watched ABD Illustrates video before this like a Trailer to a Movie.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.     YES.
This is a great and funny video. 😃
the song gay or European  is perfect for this episode
OMG HAPPY VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW IS ADORABLE! ❤❤
Too cute! I love the ending this was so worth the wait!
THIS IS AMAZING (as all of your videos are)
GAY GAY GAYYYYYYYYYY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MY HEAAAAAAAAART SCREAAMS HEEEELPP THIS IS TOO CUUUUUUTE

THOMAS. PLEASE. MAKE VIRGIL AND ROMAN A THING! THE- END- WHY DO YOU HURT ME LIKE THIS??
This is a m a z i n g
Me: **is in the middle of the episode** Also me: **knows the comments are filled with spoilers** Me: LeTs GeT tO tHe CoMmEnTs-
2:25
This is this is the best thing ever
Virgil's eyeshadow keeps going from black to purple when he's happy/excited!  And black when he’s anxious!
Roman: you’re gonna have to speak from the heart, Thomas.   *commercial break*  Swiffer: it’s such a hassle!
YAYYYYYYY!!!!
Tbh I'd love to see more animatics like this
I really hope that this actually happened
Im proud of mehhhhhh boy , meh emo-boy , my no-sleep pal  u headed one step ahead to happiness
Oh my goodness, Thomas! This was amazing! Iply. 💗💗💗💗
When I say how much I _cringed_ when that other guy popped out of the stall-
I absolutely loved this episode! It was such an amazing idea to turn this into an animated episode! I love how creative this was and how easy it was to relate...another beautiful masterpiece!!
HRG! EMOTIONS FEELINGS WHATEVER ELSE THERE IS OVERFLOWING
I ship Virgil and Roman so much!!!!!!  I hope you love to continue to make videos with them getting closer I hope you don’t mind!🥺🥰🤩
I really liked this! I'm not super akward around people, but the anxiety about talking to new people was something I really struggle with.
Anyone else notice the purple eyeshadow turn to black on Virgil?
This made me so happy!!
Is it significant that Roman's reflection is orange?
YaaaaasThe shipping is confirmed
VIRGILS EYESHADOW O MY GOD ITS PURPLE
Well this is just GREAT! PERFECT!!  ... Now I want a sander sides animated series
We all realize he's in his 30's right. j-just how
The end kinda set off my prinxiety fangirl off and I was squealing
Alright then Thomas and crew really said Prinxiety rights in this episode (also love that Virgil’s makeup turned pinkish/purple when he was super happy(almost like a blush -huh-) and then immediately turned black when Thomas said he tweeted about it)
~Prince x anxiety~ :D
Omg at the end I started crying when Roman put his hand on virgle like it’s meant to be
Idk why, but this just warms my princxiety heart...
I will say that wouldn’t a pride pin be PRETTY obvious? Lol
Gosh dangit I wish I had money so I could join your patreon 😭😭 that seems so cool 🤩
The prinxiety is strong here, i can s m e l l i t
The video is great and all but... Wth does Roman mean?! Does he have a list for all his mistakes?!!!!
DOES THIS TAKE PLACE *BEFORE* OR *AFTER* PUTTING OTHERS FIRST-
so uh- virgils purple eyeshadow- now i’m just saying-
That was brave of Virgil: Bravery is doing what you’re afraid to do
THE MIRROR SCENE HAS PRINXIETY SHIPPERS QUAKING
no one: Virgils eyeshadow at the end trying to figure out if it wants to be sparkly and purple or its usual black: cha cha real smooth
"Antisocial etiquette" ...mood
I'm dieing! My heart feels like it's throwing up cheese cause this to cheesy and my feels are everywhere! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I LOVE THIS TO FREAKING MUCH!!! 🤣🤣
I had a dream about this last night- me and Thomas were both crying for some reason-
Okay but like why is this the CUTEST thing ever 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
awwww! the change in Virgil's eyeshadow at 22:34!! gotta love the care and work that goes into every detail
"What happens when life gets a little to hard we panic" off in the distance "i chime in with the haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door"
ANXIETY HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW IF HE ISN'T WORRIED? I NEED TO KNOW PLEASE-
Virgil: Will deceit continue to be the answer to all your problems?      Janus: I mean-
I could FEEL the gay panic
THIS IS TOO ADORABLE MY GOOOOOOOOD
yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FIRST PATTON IN A SKIRT IS CANNON THEN VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!
Am I the only one who noticed that Virgil wasn’t antagonistic to Janus, saying if he built everything on deceit, would it be fair to him. Tell me I’m not the only one who noticed it
Discussion points: Roman and Virgil seemed to not beat around the bush like they usually do. I mean, it’s an Asides episode and all, but they seem... different. Thomas was also lying a lot, which wasn’t a bad thing since he was trying to get himself out of stress-inducing situations. That technically falls under Janus’s “self care” procedure he wants Thomas to keep, as an anxiety-ridden Thomas most likely won’t be taking good care of himself. The fact that Roman and Virgil go in so hard on these “lies” goes hand-in-hand with the fact that they’re both the most against Janus and the dark sides. This is also a chance to see the dynamic between the duo when “working”. It makes sense that Roman’s and Virgil’s “jobs” clash often, but what intrigues me the most is how Thomas reacts. They both show such, almost blatant, disregard for Thomas’s feelings in the moment. Thomas is obviously struggling in those awkward situations, as well as being almost bullied by Princey’s repeated “jokes”. I know they both most likely mean well, but honestly it seemed like they were kind of almost different people. This makes me think something - or someone - else is at play, at least in the beginning. They seemed to kind of snap out of it in the bathroom scene. Just a hint of speculation there... As for Virgil’s burst of bravery and the Prinxiety “moment” (since although it’s ship fodder, it could mean anything in the long run), I think the makeup switches at the end card could have implications along with that scene. Although Virgil stays with the light sides, he’s still not technically one of them. But with the makeup hints and this episode, I think something is truly stirring within Virgil and that he may be going through a change soon. All of the previous episodes have led up to this beginning of his metamorphosis into truly becoming a light side...  In the end, these are all just my opinions and speculations. This was so long awaited and I’m glad Thomas did it safely. Once I’m not broke, I’ll join the Patreon. Stay safe and thanks for coming to my Ted Talk XD
They keep calling him a liar, but I don't see Janus...  ok, yeah, no, they're actually kind of right this time, Janus should've popped up or something
Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black at the end scene there :v
The Prinxiety is *strong* with this one
I just realized ABD Illustrates made this animatic oh my goodness! I love their work, high hopes low roles and their drawings hh- Plus this is just. So relatable for me. I am very much an introvert and this describes what talking to cute girls feels like. Or any girl. Sigh.  But still. Amazing work, I love it!! Thank you!!
Hold up the eyeshadow was purple than black then purple then black. Could this be Virgil officially changing into a light side
I wanna cosplay as one of them, and its Virgil :D. Also love your content please keep doing what your doing, Thanks!
This episode must of taken soooo long to do, I love it though
This was beautiful.
Wooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m so glad you posted this. It made my day
This is so adorable
I have no words, only tears and excited screaming.
Roman saying he’ll add it to the list rlly made me uh 😺 SOB
PRINXIETY IS BECOMING OFFICIAL REEEEEE *fangirl noises*
Yeeee
My ship!! 🥺💕 Virgil x Roman!!!
Did anybody notice virgil eyeshadow change?
FINALLLLLLLYYYYYYY   I KNEW VIRGIL LIKED ROMAN AND ROMAN LIKE VIRGIL EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
Oh god, the Prinxiety shippers-
JAJAHAHJSNS AHHH NO THOUGHTS ONLY PURPLE EYESHADOW VIRGIL
I think that the most unrealistic thing about this right now is that they're in a mall
You made my bad day so much better love you Thomas ❤️❤️
HIS EYESHADOW CHANGES WHEN HE'S HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!1!!!!!!1!!!!!
I LOVED THIS VIDEO, It was so relatable. Also the ART WAS ADORABLE!!! Such a good job you guys!
Is this a dream?! WE GOT ANOTHER SANDER SIDES VIDEO!!!
So, does Thomas actually have a boyfriend now, or was it just for the series? I would be so happy if he has one now. Like, I would DIE
Ohhh my god Virgil’s eyeshadow! Why was it purple? What does this mean?! Does it turn purple when he’s super happy and/ or in love?! I need answers!!!   I love the animatic approach. There’s so much you can do with more cartoonish expressions and this just looks amazing!
Imagine they adopt a kid and the kid asks "how did you meet?"
the eye shadow. the eyeshadow
VIRGILS PURPLE EYE SHADOW. IM DYING
👁👄👁 so now the ship is real???? WOw
I. LOVE. THIS. EPISODE.
OMG VIRGILS EYESHADOW
REALLY THOMAS I'M OUT OF TOWN
This was so beautiful you just described exactly how it feels to have social anxiety im so glad you made this also sorry for not being able to do more
Virgil’s eyeshadow!!
To me this is classic sanders sides. Wholesome jokes, relatable humor and top tier character development. This made me ecstatic thank you Thomas for making my day once again 🤍🥰
Me, now with a credit card with a steady income ready to subscribe to the patron? I am going to do that now
I’m loving this! I would also love to see it reenacted live once covid19 is eradicated. Keep on creating wonderful content, Thomas and team! 💙
Did everyone watch until the end to see Virgil's eyeshadow???? The way it changes from purple when he's exited, and when it changes back to black when he's anxious??
Pintrovert
in the end virgils eyeshadow kept changing
Thomas has more confidence than me.     He actually made a move to get a boyfriend.      I’m just trying to get a friend.
#PRINXIETY  Virgil's Eyeshadow changed at moments and so did Roman's attitude
All the roxiety shippers are having a blast in the comment section, and I'm actually kinda here for it. But seriously, this episode hit hard and it was also super sweet to watch. Once again, Sanders and his sides are super relatable and, especially with Virgil, freaking precious. Just, bless the purple emo. X3
Thomas, this is sweet and hilarious! Thank you for this! Really lovely. I can't- I- OMG-
This whole video was filled with the most amazing quotes 😂. I laughed so hard at “ah Demon”. I fully can’t 😂
Woah I’m lucky a sander sides video on my birthday!
ITS HERE ITS HERE ITS HERE
Also the music as they finally strike up a conversation is just *chef's kiss*. It builds so beautifully, giving such a triumphant, hopeful feeling
No
Wait Janus is Running the Patreon shouldn’t Logan be running it. I feel like it makes the most Logical sense. I feel like Janus is trying to take Logan’s place. Ohh.
This was so cute
*the new episode came out*   Me:*starts to watch it*    My brother: what are you wa- Me:ssshhh!!!!! my show release a new episode  My brother:....... Me: *starts to cry because it's soo funny and cute* My brother:*leaves the room* Me from down the hall:OMG HE HAS A CRUSH REEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!            * end of the episode* Me: virgil's eyeshadow is purple how.  Me:its time to make a theory!!
I LOVE THIIIIISSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“AHH DEMON” virgil you’re gonna kill me
love you <3
These two.So cute! (Nice vid btw)
...Could be gayer
I forgot that Virgil is Thomas’ fight or flight reflexes, and this is the first time that he acted as the fight. I was afraid that they were going to try to full get rid of him being anxiety completely, but I think he is going to be both anxiety and bravery. So that’s probably what his eyeshadow represents?  But I also think it might a way for Virgil to show his emotions without talking about it (like the stickers and pins)? Since it’s black when he’s anxious/upset and purple when he’s brave/happy.
This is all my happiness
Virgil's Eyeshadow at the end changed from purple to black like a mood ring oh boy.
I DIDN’T MISS THE LITTLE HEART BESIDE ROMAN AT THE END 😤😤😤
I’ve never wanted sign up for a patreon more than I do right now
WAIT A MINUTE...WAIT A DANM MINUTE....VIRGILS EYE SHADOW
Virgils eye shadow gets purple when he is happy?!?!?!
Our King is back after three months ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this was incredible!!!
Why isn't anyone talking about 10:06 ? Where did all my fellow emos go?
i could see how roman rlly wanted this and virgil was too afraid to talk to him but at the end virgil did the push because he didnt want to see roman sad and i am gettin kinda prinxiety vibes from thsi video-   (EDIT: roman is a sad boi and virgil is comforting him-)
Their screams at the end lol I was screeching with them.
Is Virgil wearing purple eyeshadow?
Roman and Virgil have points
The whole video talking about stop lying Me- Janus? What are you doing with poor Thomas behind the scenes?
I‘m here from Alex‘ channel and I have to admit that I‘ve never seen one of these episodes yet, but this was the cutest thing I‘ve ever seen *~*
All the princxitey shippers be like nice Virgil you're  feeding the fire and it's is a forest fire
YOU GUYS! I'm living for the attention to detail on the fact that Virgil's eyeshadow was purple when he was freaking out. And when the anxiety kicked back in, it turned black. THOMAS, YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD! You made the filmmaker in my heart scream continuity for that little detail, THANK YOU!
That would be great if the other guy's anxiety and creativity would show up too-
MY GAY ASS WILL NEVER FORGET THIS
VIRGIL EYE SHADOW OMG THEY JUST MADE IT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN BEFORE!!! THEY ARE PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT INTO EVERY EPISODE AND EVERY LITTLE DETAIL  I LOVE THOMAS AND THE WHOLE TEAM SO MUCH
Thomas: I’m not even interested- Roman and Virgil: lie. Thomas: I don’t even know if he’s gay Roman: but you don’t know if he’s not gay! Thomas: you have used that argument on me far to many times.
"I wasn't testing you, I was panicking."  Same.
AHHH i'm so excited
*Virgil eyeshadow virgil eyeshadow virgil eyeshadow virgil eyeshadow*
Yes finally
I love how each character’s drawn and the amount of effort its probably taken and just djdjdjskkemem yes
when my mom talks about an episode of a show: Katie finally got with Jeremy. when i talk about an episode of a show: Thomas tried so hard to see if this random dude was gay, and when he found out he was, he panicked and started  being weird
AHHH DEMON
That... Was awesome!!!
Yay another asides video
My heart!!!!!!!! I loved this so much!!!!! So adorable!!!!!!😳❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I might just join Patreon....
This popped up at the perfect time
YES
me, a moxiety shipper, getting my life vest because this ship is going down: just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming
6:33 and here we have the gay in their natural habitat, circling its pray to try to find out if it is one of its own
Who else was squealing when Virgil pushed Thomas, too when Virgil and Roman had the moment that no Prinxiety shipper will forget.  Cause I sure as heck was squealing over it.
I love that when Virgil blushes his shadows become purple and silvery rather than pitch black
Second hand embarrassment is a thing... I felt that this whole time watching.
This is amazing omg  “oh I wasn’t testing you, I was just panicking” was the one that got me.
VIRGIL'S NEW EYE MAKEUP
Wait, guy guy guy? POSSIBLE FUTURE GUY!?
That mirror scene had me freaking CRYING— Thank you for everything you do, Thomas. Thank you for the seven-hour phone calls you and the team do to hash out ideas, thank you for showcasing such talented artists and creators, thank you for the time you spend writing scripts, thank you for every time you push record on that there camera, thank you for blessing your audience with songs, the Broadway-level voice, the phenomenal acting. Thank you for how inviting and comforting your content feels, for all the lives you save, for all the smiles you give, for being an advocate for so many important things. Thank you so very much for being who you are. And I speak for everyone when I say we love you and we don’t want you to feel pressured to do ANYTHING. Get lots of rest after this MASTERPIECE, Mr. Sanders! You deserve it~
Any one else get some strong prinxiety vibes
Hey so this is definitely me reading too deeply into it but, Thomas ordering his least favourite food without really thinking about it, could that be him subconsciously punishing himself for lying? Idk man, im not am expert, but i do think it's interesting that that's literally the first thing he could think to order
Him watching this video be like                 👁👄👁
96 hu? 🌚
I loved this so muchhhhhh  It was amazing and everyone who worked to put this together should be proud. I would love to know what the eyeshadow was about at the end there though
19:52 p r i n x i e t y
A NEW SUPERNATURAL EPISODE FOLLOWED BY A SANDERS SIDES EPISODE??? 2020 JUST GOT A 100 TIME BETTER
Top of the morning to ya!
i’m sorry but the Virgil’s MAKEUP AHHH
im glad to come back to this channel after like- a year  i regret being gone for that long
exited EEEEEEEEEEEEE
“Sayitback!”  Not even 5 seconds later “NOW you’ve DONE it”
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ENDING CLIP??? WITH VIRGILS CHANGING EYESHADOW??? WHAT IS WITH THAT???
No no no, I wasn't testing you *smile* I was just panicking.     Me.
VIRGIL BABY IM SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
I would love to be the guy across the foodcourt...
Me: *watches a ton of Thomas Sander's vine compilation* Me: I wonder what he's doing now? Also me: *gets notification*
cute
Omg yes, Alex! I discovered him last year when I first started to become a Dungeons and Dragons nerd and saw his D&D art!
Had a good day today hehe💘
No one gonna talk about the fact the Virgil’s eye shadow changes colors when he’s happy?? 🥺 it’s so cute!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING- This was great :')
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG THAT WAS AMAZING  Thomas getting home and all three of them being super excited it was the biggest mood in history
The moment this dropped I had such a hard time focusing on my DnD session But my gods the sheer amount of excitement this gave is giving me so much energy!! I literally ended up happy stimming, especially towards the end!!! Gods this was so good!!!! I did not expect it to be in animatic form, but dang if it the artists didn't do an amazing job!!!
UGH I LOVE ABD IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
this is a great day to be a prinxiety shipper
Ok, love the Virgil makeup shifts. But how dare you make my boy happy then rip the rug out from under him!
why is this literally a visual representation of what goes on in my head
Yayyyyyyyy!!!! New Sanders Sides
Oh my God, that was so freaking cute!
Wait a sec... Does this mean Thomas may have a new BF and this is how he is starting to introduce him?? And kinda saying how they met??? 0o0
virgil having thomas stim made me so freaking happy that i'm sitmming now thank you for showing that!!!!!
Logan: What cartoon are you watching THIS time?  Patton: *sobbing* THOMAS THE GAY
i started crying waching this SO ADORABLE
Thomas when you need to see someone’s buttons or stickers, whip out your phone, turn on your camera and zoom in! No one will think you’re looking at him and even so you can quickly slide to word crush, not that hard stop falling in trash cans Sanders
i want remus :(((
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE CHANGE IN EYE MAKEUP WHENEVER VIRGIL'S HAPPINESS FROM THE TALK WAS SLIGHTLY SMASHED????????????????
WHY DOES HIS EYESHADOW KEEP CHANGING COLOUR??
I WANT TO JOIN THE PATREON BUT I HAVE NO MONEY BECAUSE I AM A TEENAGER
According to Roman gay eyes = :3
AAAAHAHHAHAAAA OMG THAT WAS SOOO GOOOOOOODDDDDDD
AHHHH THIS WAS SOOO CUTE!!! 🥺 lmao and so accurately funny as well 🤣
Why was there an a in the intro
No one is talking about the "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay"!?!? No MCR fans?! Nothing?!?!
I love the gay panic at 16:07
I started crying at 19:56 awww soooo cute 💖       guess everyone deals with social anxiety-
I don't know what to comment because everything was too good aaaaaaaaah. It was so funny at the beginning then it got really emotional without transitions, I'm all wfihvbk<f (that's a feeling I swear). It was so so so good. That mix of humor and feelings and aaah having Vigil and Roman teaming up (almost) as well, I was so happy ! So many brilliant moments and also the A-NI-MA-TIONS HELLO !!! A whole ANIMATED EPISODE !!!! EVERYTHING WAS SO DARN CUTE !!!!!!!!! Omigosh I just can't, I'm- that was a lot to take in but basically I had missed Sanders Sides so much and this come back made me so happy and fuzzy and giddy and excited about this series again and I'm thankful for everyone who worked in this
19:12
This made me smile and now it in a very good mood, have a lovely day you wonderful humain being
I'm sorry, Internet, but how can you ship two personified representations of one person's consciousness? Isn't that, like, beyond incest? Also, how does a relationship between these two entities work? What repercussions would it have on Thomas' psyche???
??? Virgils eye shadow was changing at the end??? Oooooooo I smell CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
The stimming in the end card is so relatable
MY HEARTTTTTTTTTTTT
"shut up emo" .... I died!!! I'm sorry but i am one of the weirdos who thinks Emo and Princey would be adorable if they were a couple. I'm weird, please don't question me, my gay/bi-sexual (I'm still figuring it out) mind works in a LOT of different ways...
Did-did we just get prinxiety canon????
I saw the thumbnail and i was like "oh no there goes the fandom"
This episode Should just be re-named roman and Virgil adventures in teasing thomas
Prinxiety fans how we doing on this fine day?!?! 💜❤️
Thomas: i don't know when I'll know what i want again.  Me: i know what i want. I WANT IT THAT WAY
What means algorithm changes and video suppression and what it is too?
Virgil: what if it’s a mistake Roman: then I’ll add it to the list  Me: NO, no list
oh my god they are so cute, also was i the only one that was thinking that at the "speak from the heart" moment Patton would pop up? also also i really really love how Virgils eyeshadow changees. it's really really really cool
1 hour late... And there's already 8.1k comments...
Im crying because we can subscribe to the patreon 😢
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA II m fine
Awwwwww CUUUUUUTE!!!
I just noticed Virgil's eyeshadow changes with his mood that's a cool detail!
OMG IT FEELS LIKE FORVER
I think this is like my new favorite episode, it was so cute
Just take the word “Social” out of the title   *prinxiety fans have entered the chat*
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY AAAA JEJENEOENRIEIRI IM GONNA CRY THATS SO CUTE
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard Gay"  My new favorite roman quote
Why does he look like amazz so much
This is just me when I need to ask someone a question
prinxiety shippers after watching this: write it down WRITE DOWN and make it a comic  "DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX"  Prinxiety shippers: S A M E
Awww I wish I could join and PLZ TELL ME THIS HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE
This is just the cutest!! My little gay heart is so happy 😁
True story????????????
i love the electro swing music
Is Nico a real person?
It’s like 1am but we are FEASTING. FED. SERVED. OH MY GOD. SCREAMING.
why isn’t anyone talking about how his name is *NICO FLORES* 💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃 getting hispanic rep is the most incredible feeling on earth tysm :)
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW YOU POSTED-
Virgil: James Charles who-?       I low key love emo boy so much QwQ roman to so cute
That PRINXIETY tho. Virgil loves Princey.
I was watching memes when I saw this and this is something that we need. All we need to wait for is when they play 2 truth and 1 lie with Janus.
THOMAS, YOU CAN’T JUST SPRING THAT HAT ON PEOPLE
You see a cute boy at the mall and it turns into a fucking sage!!!
Sooooooo cuuuute! I was smiling the whole way through. Thank you 💕
*inhales* ITS WAY TO CUUUUUUTTTTTEEEEEE
That "shut up, emo" was so soft... brb Imma go cry in the corner
AASHHSHSHSJSJSJSSKSKDJDJWJSKDJDJDJSJSJSJSKS ROMAN IS SUCH BABEY IN THISSSSS DNNDJDJDJSJOQOSKEKQOALSKKEEEKEKDDJEJR
“i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay”  i love roman so much 😂
WHY IS LIKE N O B O D Y  TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW AT THE END LIKE, AHHHHHHH-
Hi Thomas!!
Imagine if the dog is Nico's XD

roman: *touches virgil’s shoulder* fanfiction writers: WRITE THAT DOWM WRITE THAT DOWN  edit: why does this have so many likes hello?????? i mean thanks but also Why
*Me waiting till the end of the video for Thomas to show Nico*
Your sander sides videos always makes my day!😁
At 10:09 my chemical romance refnce?
I can not express how much i relate to this. Being gay myself and finding someone cute or even just having to talk to someone, I panic and not say anything or really struggle because of my anxiety. This is such a good representation of how i feel and what its like. So thank you for this video it made me feel better knowing that this is how other people can feel (i said feel a lot... sorry)
Finally.. I've waited so long to see the sides again.. Please.. MORE SANDER SIDES!..
Soooo cute!!
Happy confident Virgil with purple eyeshadow is everything and made 2020 just a little bit brighter.
AAAAA THE PRINXIETY- I CAN'T- AAAAA
WHY AM I CRYING
Thomas- OUR PATREON Me being poor- ... I’m going to cry now
Thomas I'm not giving you my money I'm a teenager I need my money for radcon
This was just too cute. And other than actually getting the other guys' interest, I've been there. 😂
So is Virgil in the Imagination?
eeeeeeeeeee!!!!!! Thanks for a wonderful early birthday gift! <3
IN THE ENDING VIRGIL WAS SO HAPYYYYYY!!!!!!!
So are we just going to ignore the fact that this episode is essential to the story line!? Meaning this one can be a key detail in later episodes?!?!
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE VIRGIL BLUSH AFTER ROMAN SAID HE HAD BEEN BRAVE LIKE GNSDIBGSIBGJVISNOFOANIIFB UIQFWHU G
Hehe Virgils makeup
My prinxiety loving heart at the end of this episode: hyyrahujkjiykjcfhngdazbgjmhdc                                screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I love this, awesome job Thomas! I think it would be cool if the Sander Sides were animatics.
THE ENDING!!!VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! HES BECOMING SELF CARE *OMG!!!!!!!!!!*
MY HEART
„Shut up emo”
The boys seem ok, I am so glad they seem ok I- HFFBJSKLBGEL
That was the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life
When they're in the bathroom, Virgil is sitting on the sink, aka, a surface that is not meant to be sat on!!    I love continuity
Virgil being happy at the end.🥺🖤
The makeup in the very end suggests that Virgil is a light side now!! It's purple! Every time Virgil gets lighter, he adds purple to his outfit and now even his makeup has changed over!!
20:24   “I was Deceit all along!” “Thomas is asleep. This is a dream!”  Lol
Prinxiety at the max
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING WITH THIS THUMBNAIL   YOU KNEEEEWWWWW
This feels incredibly relatable ÚvÙ
Why- why do i ship Thomas and Nico now...
I think that Virgils eye shadow changes when he’s happy
My friend and I texted in all caps "NEW SANDERS SIDES AND IT'S GAYYYYY" and she was like "IT'S GAY?!" And now I'm watching it and freaking out
This is very helpful to me because I just just got a boyfriend last night lol
I like how virgil had a bag of popcorn. I loved that😂
oh my god i love the music and everything im an hour late but guys!! GUYSS SKDLFJDLS
Virgil is going through a change. The shadow under his eyes kept changing depending on how he was feeling between the gray/black to purple. Very excited to see more and this was definitely worth the wait.
ohhhhhhh!.....oooooohhhhhh.
This episode was awesome!
W a i t Virgils changing of eyeshadow-
God the pretty purple eye shadow 💜💜💜 And the boys are happy 💜💜💜
this was so sweet and made me very happy :]
I don't want me to be doing this either lmao
6:00 Virgil: that’s completely disregarding the *purpose* of the sticker button system. You see some buttons.... you button it. Some sound life advice thank you Virgil
I always cry with your content, you make me see a glimpse of light in the dark
I found out that I could do the stich voice from watching your old vines
VIRGILS EYESHADDOW WHEN HES HAPPY OHMYGOSHHH
*I'm screeching because I'm so excited-*
Roman and Virgil were BLUSHING AT THE END... AT EACH OTHER 😳😳😳😳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣YESSSSSS!🤩
Am I watching this for the second time even though this was posted today. Yes and?
“Oh no, I wasn’t testing you. I was just panicking.”  This is so painfully me.....
PRINXIETY!!! I CANT
*Is he gay or European*
Who voices Nico?
I just saw this on the suggestion page and I got SO EXCITED
VIRGILS MAKEUP IS SO GREAT
Calling Roman a punk for saying you're old just proves him right.  Which is... Probably the point...
I'm gonna watch this video everytime I go out to get confidence just in case I see someone cute
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW OH MY LORD
Don't forget the plant
I just noticed that when Virgil is happy his eyes shadows looks kinda glittery and when he's sad\anxious it changes to black again
VIRGIE BABY!!!!! EEK! HES IN LOVE!!! SEEING SO HAPPY MADE MY LIFE! Can I please adopt him???
This episode might be my favorite oh my god
What are you doing?! I don't know..... plant
YOUR AWSOME!!! Thats all I can give, sorry. Is he gay or European?
Virgil's eyeshadow changing!!!!!😍😍 and he said he didn't know what gay eyes were!!!!
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE PURPLE EYESHADOW ON VIRGIL AT THE END BAHDJAHDHJSJS I LOVE THE NEW LOOK
Amazing animation, I hope we get more!
I had no idea this came out an hour ago-
WHY WAS HIS EYESHADOW SWITCHING COLORS THOMAS
"I tend to waste a lot of opportunities in my life"  Hold on-      IS HE TALKING ABOUT THE CALLBACK?!?!?!?! THOMAS I-
Is nobody gonna talk about the "top of the morning to ya... No..."
O M G I love virgils new eyeshadow * . * Ohnits only purple when hes very happy :O
Shut up emo. I love it. Prinxiety
YES THANK YOU THOMAS WE LOVE YOUUUU
HIS EYESHADOW WAS PURPLE THEN IG TURNED TO BLACK WHEN HE GOT TOO ANXIOUSSSS
Also when Virgil says to shake his hands cuz they're just hanging there- honestly now; flippin relatable 😂    And Virgil smiling is so  precious - he's _myyy    preciousss!_  Oh and I wonder if he'll see Thomas's videos with the sides- what if he sees this video- ah now i want a reaction video so badly 😬😂
aaaand we didn't get a prinxiety kiss dammit
This describes me 24/7 like I cried after seeing the first one. Thomas, keep up the amazing work sorry I can' donate but I wish I could keep doing what you do man love your work - Graeme
Thank you so much for all the effort put on this episode! Thomas, I hope you know how much you can brighten someone’s day with videos like these. I absolutely love the collab with these amazing artists, and I’m glad you guys still find creative ways to keep posting even with everything that’s been happening in the world. Great job everyone!! 💖
This really called out my gay panic in stores🤣
yayayayayayay. giant woman -Steven universe- stuck in my head for no reason

Ok this is so f***ing cute Thomas I LOVE IT
Ah, yes...my two personalities giving me great advice when talking to girls
Virgil starting to breath hard made me lose it, I screamed so loud XD
Can I say I love Virgil’s makeup, the light glittery purple is amazing with the darker shade!!
*WHEN HE SAID HE DIDNT KNOW WHAT HE WANTED ROMAN LOOKED AT VIRGIL AAAAA*
this is so sweet
This is SO CUTE I- I LOVE IT
19:15 "the Hm of disbelief"
Thomas that was just perfect just perfect beautiful my favorite thing that I've ever I'm a huge fan but that's a beautiful thing I've ever seen so it almost made me cry
Oh my god! I loved the story and it made me cringe but also feel so much happier about finding love and happiness. And then I remembered how alone I am and how my social anxiety will likely always win. Now I'm depressed 😢
Omg I love this so much and was that a reference to jacksepticeye? "Top a the morning to ya… buddy?"
*Hears about Patreon, screams in sad broke fander*
*WHY THE FUQ IS THIS MAKING MY EYES SWEAT* *!* *?*
OMG VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYE SHADOW-
And now I want Sander (a)Sides to be a Disney Channel show!
Ok did anyone see the part where Roman said he'd add it to the list if he made a mistake?
VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES FROM BLACK TO PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY OMGGHSJAGSJD
FINNALY
I loved this!
IM SORRY WHAT
AWWWWWWWW
Is there a 1000 likes like button? CAUSE I LOVE THIS VIDEO SOOOOOO MUCH!!!
I’ve literally been staring at my phone waiting for my phone to ring me about the notification i’m so happy right now
So cute
DID I- DID THEY NAMED HIM NIKO TO MENTION THE 'GAY OR EUROPEAN' SONG OR IS HE A REAL PERSON I DON'T KNOW BUT IF IT IS THE SONG I'M LAUGHING SO HARD
Thomas: *makes gay eyes*  Youtube: *plays ad*
Lmao this episode is just fan service I swear-
OMG OMG OMG OMG HE'S BACK!
I love how Roman and Virgil kept popping up out kf no where
Nice touch changing Virgil’s eyeshadow between black and purple! 🖤💜
OH MY SANDERS- Am I the only one who really wants a ship to happen? (Personally Mine is Prinxiety)!!! Cant wait for the next episode
Ok but why is no one talking about how much he mentioned Patton I mean I thought he was gunna pop up in the bathroom
PUT THE PURPLE UNDEREYE BACK RIGHT NOW
Happy Virgil making Thomas happy stim 😍😍
Sander-tonin has been established!!!
Bro I can’t it’s too cute
OMG I AM SO HAPPY  Also I been a fan for a while now I love your videos and I also follow your Twitter but ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh I am so happpppy We all know that Virgil gave Roman gay eyes
I feel this all the time. I want to start finding someone for me but I feel like I’m a bother, I feel like I’m an annoyance, I feel like I’d be more of a burden to them then what they might be going through, and I don’t know how to talk to people. I really relate to this a lot.
sanders sides is like modern day mr rogers
**All prinxeity shippers simultaneously screaming**
Is nobody talking about Virgil's eyeshadow turning PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY???  💜🖤Thomas you mad genius I love you🖤💜
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS ON NARUTO'S BIRTHDAY YOU ARE NOW MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER!!!
I know this might be a dumb idea, but you should make a sanders sides podcast starring Thomas and one part his personality every episode.
Gosh I'm just here smiling like a goddamn fool. Theyre too cute 💜💜💜
That part in the bathroom hits right at home
Does any one ship    Virgil and Roman??
It was amazing to see you work with artists, it was because of one of them that I even discovered your channel. It was amazing to see him so excited because he got to work with you, continue what you're doing. Look at the people that love it, this is truly wholesome
My prinxiety senses to krrrr-
23:41 Happy stimming!! I do that!!
the art in this was freaking incredible, and I LOVED seeing Virgil and Roman lowkey kicking Thomas' ass together. SPOILERS     VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES COLOR WHEN HES HAPPY I FUCKING ADORE IT
I hate that I've gotten to the point in my depression that watching someone else who once made me happy with his cheerful aesthetic and personality just makes me feel bad about myself. I hardly have enough energy to get out of bed in the morning and this guy is doing these super energetic videos that are so fun and amazing to watch. I hate that watching this, which did give me a lot of joy, just ended with me breaking down because I couldnt stop thinking about how much I suck.
I relate to this
The ultimate prinxiety episode? That happens to do with flirting?
AHHHHHHHHHH VIRGIL YESSSSSS THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW THE HAPPY ANXIETY!!!!!!! Jsjsehdgdhshdhhdd
Virgils eyeshadow changing is🥺
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Prinxiety.
MY PRINXIETY HEART IS D Y I N G
I think it being animatic would let you go crazier with it, and also things that may be a bit cringe in real life are more acceptable in cartoons  anyway, loved this, was a lot of fun and sweetness!
I love how Thomas showed how much they hate Janus because they keep using lying as an insult. I love Janus but it’s a subtle thing I picked up on in this and it’s great
I'm not gay. But I have social anxiety. So I relate to this on👏such👏a👏personal👏level👏  I love this
P 🏳️‍🌈R🏳️‍🌈I🏳️‍🌈N🏳️‍🌈X🏳️‍🌈E🏳️‍🌈T🏳️‍🌈Y     Also did no one notice Virgil’s eyeshadow?
Thomas: “Nothing but a bruised ego..”  Roman: [Glare]
This radiates “In a heartbeat” vibes and I love it
I saw the ending Virgil u had to say it in that tone       I love this ep Thomas thank u so much for  being here  -Sissi Moonstar
“What if this is a mistake?” “I’ll add it to the list!!” Oh no Roman is still hurting 😔
i saw what you did with the eyeliner!! and i can't wait to find out what it means
I loved this so much!
10:08 YEEEEEEES
Virgil's makeup at the end keeps switching between purple and black and idk how to feel about it
Virgil!   Yay loved this!!   When Roman put his hand on Virgils shoulder I almost died
**Psychopathicly fangirling in background**
AJDHHSHSHJS PRINXIETY FOR THE WIN BABY IM RIDIN THIS SHIP FOREVER EVERYONE HOP ABOARD

*I’m going to start saving to pledge to the patreon*
Noo I'm so sad! I tried joining the Patreon (the 2nd tier) but for some reason it doesn't go through! I loved this episode btw 💜
Virgil's colour changing eyeshadow is giving me LIFE ❤❤
when is the part when virgil says “this is a mistake” and roman says “if it is i’ll add it to the list” i wanna watch that pert but i can’t find it
I'm in love with this video omg. Time to watch it thirty times
OMG!!!YESSS!✨💖
Oh my god!! I loved this so much, every part of it! This is totally what it feels like when you want to talk to someone, especially when they’re cute. I also LOVE how well Roman and Virgil got along today, it’s nice to see them like that. Also, what does the new eye-makeup mean 👀 I’m sure we’ll find out soon, but Virgil definitely looked a lot happier. I also loved that Roman called Virgil “Gerard Gay” that was awesome. And the animatic was so cute, I hope the crew knows how much we appreciate it. This episode was a 100/10 for me! Virgil is adorable. This is just aghhh it’s so good and so cute and so true and I love it
I feel this so much! I’m like “ her jeans are cuffed!!! She has to like girls!”
Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple and shimmery when he's happy, I'm literally going to combust with joy I can't believe this
prinxity shippers: hippity hoppity this video is now my property
ROMAN AND VIRGIL NEED TO CHILL THEY'RE STRESSING ME OUT-
Our little emo is rocking that cute purple eyeshadow!💜 Also Roman and Virgil make the best comedy duo, their arguments are so entertaining.  Great job Thomas and crew, you guys are amazing!!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING FROM BLACK TO PURPLE AEFBJSHBFJHSEB I LOVE IT HERE
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS PURPLE
Hsjdhr hi s eyeshad o w turns purple when he blushes andhdjffh m y hea r t dhdhfbfhhf
I love how Roman and Virgil kind of exchanged "roles" at the end: Roman became insecure and nervous about the whole thing, and Virgil became the final push Thomas needed to go find his own happiness! Beautiful!
I'm just imagining Thomas talking to himself in the mall
😱prinxiety😱it’s back😱
The "nonbinary pals" always makes me feel better becuase I'm not out to most people yet.
My social anxiety turns on and off. Yesterday I had to walk into a restaurant and all I had to say was, “I’m here to pick up an order for Matt.” I walked in the restaurant stood in line and when I finally got to the front of the line I forgot my line  and said, “I have order??”
Did anyone else notice that Nico said “ do you mind telling me about them”?  At 16:22? He was referring to Roman and Virgil. They’re imaginary, so maybe he can see them?!??!??!
Virgil is SMILINGGGGGG
The amount of times I just randomly smiled during the video was once       Because I started and didn't stop
How very, PINteresting
Did anyone else literally squeal at their phone in public... no... just me....
4:44 5:36 I feel VERY called out
OKAY BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE PURPLE EYESHADOW UNDER VIRGIL'S EYES? AND HOW HE WAS ALL GIDDY IN THE ENDCARD
I was legit crying at the end of this because I was so excited and happy! It was so good! I've missed this so much! <3
*PRINXETY ALART* *THE SHIPPERS ARE COMING* *I REPEAT* *PRINXETY ALART*
I can feel the pain
this is the gayest thing ive ever seen and i am not complaining
I think Thomas just made one of the biggest ships canon??? Or somewhat??
You see I would join patreon and give the hold highest, but my broke ass can’t
My Prinxiety heart is sobbing and so am I  because there was just so much wholesomeness and THANK YOU GUYS
The jokes got me every time x'D!
Lmao Virgil's eyeshadow colour changing with his mood XD
Another name for prinxiety: gay panic The basis of the entire video: gay panic This episode is basically just prinxiety and I am here for it! I love vee’s purple eyeshadow at the end and I love everything that you do Thomas.  P.S. near the end end of the animatic I had to remind myself that is was canon and made by the team, it seemed like a fan animatic because it felt like it wasn’t canon but it is and I’m freaking out oh gosh.
I'm loving the purple eyeshadows!!!
HE DID IT!!!! YES
I loved this episode!!🥺✨
Oh ho ho, 96 is...comfortably back to back...ish.
.O.M.G. DID I JUST SEE....ROMAN AND VIRGIL GETTING ALONG!?!?!?
👀
me the whole time to Roman and Virgil: KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS
Pintrovert LOL
OHHH MY GOOOOD THIS WAS SO SWEET  THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE ARTISTS THAT HELPED MAKE THIS EPISODE  Yo does Virgil have new eye shadow? Sweet
yes yes yes yes
Amazing job everyone! Loved the animatic! <3
Virgil is still calling Janus, Deceit. He doesn’t even know they know his name.  The guy said to call him nico. Like. Am I the only one who sees the connection?
*AUDIBLE SQUEEEEEE* THIUS WAS SO GOOD!!! Not one but THREE animators/artists i love collating, the script, the change of location in plot, the FRIGGIN’ PRINXIETY collating (as a treat) and OMG the gay disastering!!! Also, the makeup Quill did for Virgil at the end with the purple eyeshadow for when Virgil is happy/less anxious is SO COOL!!!!! SO worth the wait!!! Friggin’ fantastic job to everyone involved!!!!
okay this is nice but where is Logan, I want to know if he’s okay from the last episode

I’m CRYING!!! ❤️❤️❤️
This one seems to use public spaces so I'm excited to see how it changes in live action
I absolutely love the purple glitter eyeshadow on  virgil when he’s happy!
if someone came up to me with that monologue i’d marry them right then and there
Bro the final scene I was straight up screaming this is so cute oh my goodness gracious. Good for you Thomas!! I’m so proud of you!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
*Thomas:* I just saw it- *Virgil and Roman:* LIES!  *Janus:* for real y'all gonna call him out without me?
19:04 OMFG-
I'm so glad this showed up in my notifications today. I really needed it.
Oh my goodness, did.. did Virgil’s makeup just changed at the end as he constantly changed between anxiety and that happy emotion? :’D
I loooooveeeee it, you are incredible.
Awww. Virgil's eyeshadow goes purple when he's happy 💜
Prinxiety shippers express yourselves
"That's an introverted way of talking about yourself without doing anything too extreme. Like talking" is such a mood. Beautiful job  Also, YAY VIRGIL'S BACK! And the prinxiety in this one oh my gosh!
Thomas is such an awkward little bean-
6:50 Anyone else catch the refrence? No? Just me?
Virgil roman and thomas: SCREAMMING AHHHHH  the other sides: da heck is going on there
OH MY GOD!!! THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL <333 my baby Virgil is so brave... I'm proud of him uwu
Well if I didn’t ship prinxiety already I sure do now
so relatable when you have a crush gay crush.
The dog: BARK BARK!! Virgil: GAHH DEMON!!!  Me: *Chuckles in relatable*
PRINXIETYYYYYYYY OMG I LOVE THIS
All aboard the Virgil is opening up more train
AHHHHHHH
Game idea: take a shot each time they mention lies and make you think Janus is going to appear
Oh god my prinxiety brain,, Thank you Thomas
wait does this mean thomas might have a possible love interest omg ive been waiting for him to be this happy for years🥺
*the last 5 mins happen*  Me: *dies of purity* 🥺

19:38 PRINCEXIETY SHIPPERS GOME GET YALL FOOD
Black to purple back to black what is going on with your eyeshadow either way I love the fact is shifts so we can actually know when your actually feeling something other than anxious if the purple is anything to go by and it sparkles
Quote of the day "shut up emo"
The princexty fans are dying right now.

Hey thomas I was wonder I have anxiety and I get nervous  about what happens when my anxiety get out of control what do I do?...
"You saw me knock over the trashcan, didn't you?" "That was *YOU*" Priceless.  Also the lil hearts at the end... 2 sets of uncontrollable gay energy this episode and I love it!!
I’ve never clicked faster
This whole episode was the cutest thing (and the way Virgil’s eyeshadow turned purple when he was excited was amazing to see)
This was amazing!! I loved every bit of it!!!
Prinxiety shippers are ✨quaking✨      Read: I am ✨quaking✨
Roman: What are you doing?  Thomas: I don't know... Plant  Me: Same, Thomas. Same.
Me being a child who can't have many social media platforms and just being able to convince my dad to let me download discord is feeling left out about patrion
ooooohhhhh.... *OHHHHHHHH.......*
Yessassssss finally yeeeesss
16:10 .......  And this is what we call a gay panic.
SEEING VIRGIL ASK THOMAS TO HAPPY FLAP MADE ***ME*** HAPPY FLAP THIS EP IS SUCH A BOOST FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR THANK YOU THOMAS and sorry for the caps lock lol

Awwwwwwwww❤❤🌈
"I don't mean to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay-" I died 😂
Don't mind me, just gunna be sitting here screaming in Pan gibberish
Hello! The conversation in the bathroom ( 13:30 ish ) when Thomas started talking about not being sure what he really wanted in life- that’s Roman’s job! His hopes and dreams?! ....I think he feels like he’s failing Thomas at that moment. -❤️
Hey, I know you're probably not going to see this in this ocean of already posted comments (heck I'm not even sure I'm going to post this or not) but, this episode, it really hit me in the feels, not in like a romantic "I wanna be with you" kind of way, but a more relatable kind of way, I'm only 17 at the moment, me rehearsing what I'm going to say to someone in the mirror, or my anxiety stopping me from just going up to someone and telling them how I feel, or my many wasted opportunities, or just my luck in lesbian romance in general (I'm actually bi with a stronger attraction to girls if that makes any sense). But what I'm trying to say is that I look up to you, in a way that's difficult for me to describe. Like I said before I'm not even sure if you're going to even see this or if I'm even going to post this, my anxiety is pretty high at the moment, in shaking a little just typing this.   (Side note: I like how Roman and Virgil started getting along at the end despite their clear personality differences.)
I loved the old jokes
Virgil's eyeshadow turning purple when he's excited is so freakin' cute OMG
I want to join this Patreon but like I don't have money T-T
Me single and struggling to even talk with my classmates: WRITE IT DOWN WRITE IT DOWN
Shut up emo... AWEEEEEEE
FINALLY!! This was soo funny!! 😂😂
I wish I could join the Patreon, but I'm poor 😢. But I still love you guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This series is always amazing to watch!!!!!!!!!!!♥️♥️♥️
I ADORE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
OK BUT LIKE CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGED WITH HOW HE WAS FEELING?!?  WHEN THOMAS TOLD HIM NOT TO EXPECT TO MUCH HIS EYESHADOW WAS BLACK   AND WHEN ROMAN HYPED HIM BACK UP HIS EYESHADOW WAS PURPLE!!! NOT TO MENTION IRIDESCENT!!
My poor little anxious baby🥺💜🖤💜
THE FACT THAT THE OTHER GUYS VOICE IS JOAN AHAG
YAS FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
I'm BAWLING 😭😭💕💕💕💕💕💕
Awww this was a super cute video
This video,like all your others are so helpful. It's such a good way to teach others about themselves. Thank you (and all the other contributes) for finding a way to shed light on these types of aspects. It is very helpful and enjoyable.
AHHHHHH
My friend LOVES Sanders sides tysm for posting stuff
virgil and roman remind me of gay dads disappointed in their son
I got so excited when I saw Virgil with the purple eyeshadow! And he’s super excited in this episode AWWW IM SO HAPPY!!
THIS VIDEO GOT ME GOING TOFHENFUSNDJSNRJGNEIDBNWDJD
Oh... oh no. How dare you use nny love for janus to get me into patreon.
This is probably my favourite video!! 🥰💖🏳️‍🌈
Ok theory time: Some Spoilers! And angst            So we can infer that when Virgil is feeling less anxious and is more happy his eyeshadow starts becoming purple, but when that anxiety returns his eyeshadow becomes black again. However, this in turn implies that Virgil hasn't felt this amount of happiness throughout the entire series, as this is our first time seeing this happen. Even when Virgil has acted happy, it wasn't on this level. Roman also says to Virgil "if I am, I'll add it to the list!" In response to Virgil telling him he's making a mistake, which shows that Roman is almost keeping check of that he has made mistakes and a lot of them. If Roman meant this in a literal sense or not, because Roman would make a list of mistakes, like a actual lost that is a list of his mistakes, I'm not sure. I also believe that the way they write lines is supposed to symbolize something. Virgil and Roman constantly mention that Thomas shouldn't be living on lies and that deceit isn't always the awnser. I believe this is attempting to throw some light on why Virgil left the dark sides. The episode also says that Thomas shouldn't build the relationship on lies, or else what would happen in the future. They also mention that Thomas might not deserve him if he just lies to him. I believe that the situation might be a showing of what happened in the dark sides. Deceit was the awnser to them, in a figuritive and literal sense. Janus was a awnser to Virgil and Remus. Deceit was the awnser to Janus and in turn the others. But as they say, what will become of a  relationship that's built on lies(any relationship of that matter, platonic or romantic)? And we see Thomas questioning if he deserves this person. The obvious awnser might be Janus, but not now. I believe that Virgil might fit this stance. They even say Deceit isn't the awnser to everything (though I might be throwing at that point). But Virgil fits this. We see Virgil question his morals and says that they were better off without him when he ducked out. This is almost a direct mirror of what Thomas was thinking. Virgil even tried to leave the Light Sides by ducking out. I believe that Virgil tried leaving the Dark Sides because as he thought with the Light Sides, they were better off without him. Except that Virgil succeeded in leaving. I theorize that the episode is supposed to help shed light on the situation and on Virgil. They fail and leave the guy alone at first. But this time Virgil takes a leap and connects Thomas and the guy. And I believe and hope that it's supposed to be foreshadowing that Virgil wants to reconnect with the Dark Sides, he just needs to take a leap and speak from his heart.
yessssssssssssssssssssssss
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This gives me so much Prienxiety vibes and I love it!
PRINXIETY PRINXIETY PRINXIETY 😍😍😍😍😍
can we talk about the change up of virgil’s purple and black eyeshadow ???
What does the colour change in Virgils eye shadow in the end card mean? It’s pretty! I know it has meaning! Someone help me out?
am i the only one screaming in gay? lol  AHHHHH SOOO CUTEEEE OMGGGGG
vigil:*makes eyes at roman and a hart next to his face* you: those too are so close me:make THEM KISS ALL READY
I just love how Virgil’s eyeshadow changes from the emotions he is feeling
Is anyone going to mention virgil's eyeshadow switching to purple??? Whats THAT all about???
I'm glad I found this!!!! Its beautiful!!!!
All I can say is what just happened and Thomas what are you planning. Seriously like, I love the name for the extra perks, I hate that I'll never be able to get them, but awesome. Like is he trying to hint that Virgil likes Roman, because it would be sweet to see these two together, though I am a huge Roceit shipper. Like there were so many relatable things happening, I love the change in eye shadow, that was such a neat trick. Awesome one Thomas, it was worth the wait.
Janus in this episode be like: 💃
I loved this episode💖 My gosh I am also looking forward to the new ones! The story was really something else, it made my heart race and it made me smile!  Please keep up the great work Mr. Sanders and of course to everyone else who helped creating this beautiful work of art! I shall share this to my friends so that you guys could get more support💖💖💖
This all went oddly poorly, accuratly, and well all at once. XD! Adored every second.
OMG VIRGIL LOOKS SO CUTEEE!! I love the purple eyeshadow 🥺🥺🥺🥺💖💖💖
Awwwww I love this!!!!!!!
VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYE SHADOW
VIRGILS EYEBAGS GET SHINY WHEN HES HAPPY IM CRYINGGG
When Roman said you have to speak from the heart. A commercial came and started saying no LMAO 😂😂
Virgil going out do his comfort zone to make Thomas and Roman happy is my entire life now. Also I’m loving Roman and Virgil’s dynamic. They are the best duo ever
Do you have to pay to join the thinggg
how I felt throughout the whole video: *gay squeals* EEEEEEEEEEEE
I cringed and loved it at the same time.      Someone make that an emotion!
Virgil lighter eye shadow being purple, is beautiful
Virgil still being me irl...
Wait is Virgil bravery?
So um virgil's eye shadow kept changing in the last scene a i'm still crying i died
CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW!?  I have a theory, it could be that it turns purple when ever virgils excited bc it did go away for a second, or it could just be that they messed up a shot or it could also be that now that Virgil told Thomas he's a dark side it could be him becoming more of a light sight, yhe eyeshadow going from (dark) black to a (light) colourful purple
I was already flapping my hands and then Virgil said to move your hands and I just flapped into overdrive. Loved this format. I'd be happy even if it stayed in this animated form because it was so engaging. Loved it. Already signed up for Patreon. Looking forward to supporting the team further.
23:38 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID EXCITED SHAKY HANDS!
YOU SAW HOW VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES COLOR WHEN HE IS EXCITED?! I LOVE IT
Virgil: “You’re making a mistake!”  Roman:*”If I am, I’ll add it to the list!”*   Nuuuuu my baabbyy*YYYY*yyy
THIS IS SO GOOD I- I CANT!  But also the Roman angst  anyway (prolly everyone thought this but whatever) theory time: the first thing I noticed when they came to real life is ; Virgil's eyeshadow was more of a lavender color. But as soon as he started getting really anxious it was black again. So I'm guessing the eyeshadow responds to his anxiety level, so maybe that means; he's lighting up/going away? Of course he will always be there, but he may be becoming less present?
And it was at that moment I knew...I shipped Nico and Thomas.. I hall call this ship Tomico
Omg the hearts and blush at the end, my multishipper heart is screaming
*Cries in hates the ship Prinxiety*
*breath* GAY SCREAM!
That was so cool! I loved it!
prinxiety shippers are YELLING
I got here faster then logic can say falsehood. Love your videos Thomas!
This is so cute 🥺🥺🥺
I am obsessing over this art style.
_prinxiety shippers are _*_s c r e a m i n g_*
OK BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE GLITTERY PURPLE EYESHADOW AND VIRGIL'S *FIRST* GENUINE SMILE??
"join me! no thinking!!!" HIMBO ROMAN RIGHTS
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! I have to watch this on live action!
Dude some parts of this made me cringe so hard I hid my screen.  That was awesome acting Thomas.
I vote keep the Purple Eyeshadow, looks better than the black, and goes well with his hoodie.
Virgle wanting to please Roman so much that he literally pushes Thomas out of his comfort zone gives me LIFE    NICO!!!!!🤩🤩🤩    PRINXITY IS REAL!!!
OH MY GOD YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ok is it just me or do i feel like ROMAN HAS A THING FOR VIRGIL AT THE END MY HEART WAS LIKE EEEEEEK
he is alive!!
this entire episode is just full-on prinxiety and i adore it
I love this I'm laughing so hard I'm at "cute guy at 12:00" time 4:30
so i'm relating to this on a level i have never related to anything else before (only the beginning though lmao)
I mean this video kinda says so much about meeting someone you like I'm a bit inspired by this because it's hard to like someone you never talked to
That was so cuuuute. Omg thomasssss
Anyone notice the eyeshadow change at the end when Virgil becomes very nervous, its black, but when he's freaking out with Roman and Thomas, its light purple?! Like what?!?!
Anxiety at the mall is my brand lol
Hey has anyone noticed how Virgils eyeshadow changes to purple when he’s happy anxious for lack of a better phrase
No one: Virgil when a dog barks: Ah A dEmOn!!! Omg i love these two so much!
The Roman/Anxiety shippers are having a field day, I'm sure lol
Virgil and roman duo is the best thing ever,like they were really good in this video😂.My fav video so far.They work together so well.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! this video is SO FREKIN CUTE i love it <3
I love Virgils new eyeshadow
gay eyes? I you should see what happen when lesbians make eyes at you
Omg this is so cool. I missed your videos so much cant wait for more.
SO MUCH PRINXIENTY MATERIAL AAAAAA  *When you're broke but you love Janus and you wanna get everything related to him* dkhfjch
After watching I literally got a nose bleed from excitement and shipping
butiful
Absolutely funny video but also I physically can’t watch half of it bc of my social anxiety
This is the earliest I've ever been Edit: so that was the most beautiful thing I've ever watched-
"that defies the whole point of the pin and sticker system" in other words the pin and sticker system is sacred and you will not interrupt his introverting with this gay panic until you know he doesn't mind
I WANNA JOIN THE PATREON BUT IM bROKE
I have clinical social anxiety but that so hurt to watch 😣😖 noooooooo
OML I literally died at all the prinxiety moments!!!!  Also OmL I think purple eyeshadow is excitement and black is anxiety!!
This is so fuckin cute and hit so hard
i havent stopped stimming throughout this whole video
AHHH OMG THT PRINXIETY MOMENT AT THE END!!!  I WAS PRACTICALLY JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO KISS AND BE CANON😂😂
Gay eyes.... Gay eyes
I can see the gay panic coming from this😭
This is so sweet! Truly amazing!
Yo did anyone see the switch between Virgil's eyeshadow? That's a nice touch
Virgil with purple eyeshadow I REPEAT VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!! OMG AJWVWKABMQ IU V
As a Prinxiety shipper, I squeal cause they seem to care about each other even if there just teasing, like how virgil saw how upset roman got and push thomas and how roman thank him and said that was bravery
Guys! We have someone to ship Thomas with now!
Love how my social anxiety means that my second hand embarrassment meant that it took me double the length of the video to actually watch it bc I’d get so anxious for him jdhshsgshfjfkfkf wtf
This is amazing!
I love virgins new eye shadow colour... wait is that what happens when he actually is excited and not as anxious as his normal self? Is this what happens when the boy is actually expressing his emotions more than usual!!!! (I loved the video, great job like alwayse!)
EEEEE MY SHIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
New sander sides yay
9:05 Best scene ever
Thomas: we have a patreon  Me: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
This is the cutest episode! I love animatics. Was Virgil’s eyeshadow changing between black and purple? That’s really cool.
*sees patreon*  M A A A N MY TIME HAS FINALLY COME TO SUPPORT MY FAVORITE SERIESSSSS
19:58  I like to think that Roman can litterally just summon tiny hearts because he's Roman and not because it's the animator's way of expressing that he's being affectionate
AHHHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! I hate that I came late :(
Theyre SO GAY
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW! In the end part! AHHHHH!
This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen. I'm literally crying from it.
Deceit got a Break of being Called a Liar
What if we want the new shirt but cant join the patreon?
THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING & I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
I'm crying 😭 Also I'm almost 30 and feel old
All the princeity fans why didnt they kiss reeee
AHAHA SO MANY AWKWARD ROMAN SCREENSHOTTTTSSSS
When you realize the only reason Roman can touch Virgil is because they’re animated
So not to be weird but um Prinxiety maybe ummmmm
Any one else misinterpreted the title? As in Flirting with Social Anxiety, like Roman flirting with Virgil. And not what it actually is Thomas, someone with social anxiety, trying to flirt?
Okay, but he said this episode was important to the plot so does that mean that nico is a recurring person? Is thomas actually dating someone? Or is this a plotline??? I just want more happy virgil ahhh
GUYS ROMAN IS TALLER THAN VIRGIL AHHHHH
i dont think i stopped screaming this entire episode holy-
Who else thought that this video was about one of the sides flirting with Virgil
prinxiety shippers come get y’all’s juice
"What are you doing?!"  "I dunno... Plant..."
22:35 Wait a second is Virgil BLUSHING!??? BECAUSE HE'S USUALLY HAVING BLACK EYE SHADOW!  23:00 Around there he turns normal.
Appreciation comment for the artists who worked on this. They did an amazing job!
🥺
I’m not a sanders sides regular per-say, but this was very wholesome :)
YaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaAaAAaAaAaA- *gasp* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY IT'S HERE!!!!
FULL PRODUCTION LATER PLEASE
"...you saw me knock over that trash can, didn't you?" "that was you???"  hilarious 😂😂😂
At the end Virgil’s make up kept changing! It was more purple and iridescent when he was happy and then a dull black when his mood dipped the slightest bit!
Seeing Virgil care so much for Roman and Thomas that he went out of his comfort zone so they could be happy almost made me cry 🥺💕🥺💕
Roman: its in france Virgil: im listening I love these dumbasses
Had me bawlllling
All these puns, Patton must be so proud
so cute!!!
OMG Roman and Virgil in this video got me like 😍
Oh my god I can’t tell you how much this warmed my heart 🥺💞💞💞 this was so beautiful!! 💞
Is no one going to talk about VIRGIL'S NEW MAKEUP
“Shut up emo” 😂🤣😂🤣😂
I’m literally crying this was so cute!
I’ve been waiting for this for so long 😆 I’m excited   Edit : this is so cool and cute 🤩
"You're a creep, you're a weirdo."  "What the heck are we doing here?"  I see what you did there. Noice
his eyeshadow changes!!! purple when not as anxious, black when anxious!!!! he’s rly becoming a part of the light sides 🥺💜
I DO NOT CARE THAT IT'S 1 AM AND THAT I'M LATE, THIS IS AMAZING. THE DETAIL ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS ALSO AMAZING. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS INTENDED BUT THE AMOUNT OF PRINXIETY HERE IS SLOWLY TEARING ME APART FROM HAPPINESS OR SOMETHING I FORGOT THE WORD OF BECAUSE I'M TOO EXCITED- I have watched this more than two times now- Edit: Hold on, I think I just died for a second there- Nope, nope, I'm alive
CANNON Proof that sides can affect Thomas and can follow him outside!
just one point out near the end that virgil's eye shadow changes from black to purple like he's giving of some sort of happiness or joy that Patton would usually give him seeing that patton is Thomas's felings, or turning into more of a light side?idk just use this info of how you want to
I'm sad I can't join the patreon and I really want too but I can't I have been here since the start of Sander sides   I am sorry I can't join if I could i would

Did anyone else notice that Virgil’s eyeshadow changed from black to purple when he was happy??
“I HATE HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY” 🤣🤣🤣
They did it the boys did it
JFJSJSHSHAUAHA THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER OMG NEW FAVORITE
Ok so we found out something about Virgil, when he is "very happy" his eyeshadows are purple (so cute) but when he gets "anxious" his eyeshadows turns black. I really liked that  :3 I wonder what Patton and Logan would say about what happened
He said “patreon” and I paused the video to go join instantly.
Omg love it
16:17 happy stim-1 ft.R O M A N 18:51 That was so Remus's face don't even- 19:21 SHUT UP- 19:41 1)SCREAMINGGGGG 2) VIRGILS SMILE VIRGILS SMILE VIRGiLS SMILEEEEEEEEEEE 22:24 collective screaming 23:28 Stimming (happy or not just stimming in general)-2 ft. C H A R A C T E R ! T H O M A S 23:40 Virgil sounds so mad when he says, "They're just hanging there" 24:01 annalising  (I cant spell), Virgil's eyeshadow, in the part where it was zooming in on is face, was black, and not purple, yes it could've just been the fact that he was calm at the time (we look to much into things), but that means the realization that he had made was either something that sent him into a complete state of shock where you just practically stand there, but he didn't look that shocked, more like his mind brought something up to him, a he needed to take a sec to think about it, although he got interrupted by the dog, screaming, "Ah demon-!", either way he was caught off guard, but theres two ways this can go (that I can think of), one, he was scared by the loud noise that obviously isn't/wasn't human (and he was in his own state of mind forgetting whats real and whats not), or, the thing that Virgil was thinking about was something about a demon/someone that he knew, was seen as a demon to him (most likely Janus and/or Orange/Black/White), so when he was caught offguard by the dog, his mind was thinking about that person (that sounds like a ship, this isn't what this is rn-), so they were what came to Virgil's mind, and he was look, "Oh sh!t the demons here", idk i'm probably overthinking everything again- About the fact that this video contributes to the SandersSides series, Virgil in this is seeing Thomas as Janus almost the whole time, meaning he has a hate for Thomas in most of this episode, so when Thomas makes up another lie in the bathroom,  Virgil leaves, he was sick of it, he brings it up when Thomas leaves the bathroom (as we can see) and is p!ssed, so he's generally just mad at Thomas, Roman was starting to catch on to the fact that Virgil was mad, and had confirmed it to himself when Virgil 'confronted' Thomas, and he helped Virgil out by saying that lying isn't the right way to do things, because if you lie your way into a relationship, then you're gonna need to keep up those lies the whole time you're in a/the relationship, which is not a good thing, because the second you accidentally (or purposely) show what you're actually like, that's when they will most likely start to not like you, one because they liked the other you, because that's how they interpreted you the whole time that you two(/three/idk you do you) were together, so when they realize that your not actually like they way that they thought that you were like, they start to not like you, or because they don't like people lying to them/wished that you didn't, or both, either way, Virgil had snapped About the fact that this contributes to the SandersSides series, Roman is to caught up in his love for Nico to understand whats happening around him (besides when Thomas embarrasses himself because when that happens Virgil has more control over Thomas and makes him s c a r e d and anxious, making Roman also scared, making Roman break out of his state of love for Nico[I swear my Magnus self is SCREAMING]), Roman see's how mad Virgil is, and wants to try to help him calm down without anyone realizing what hes doing, so he does just that, yet Roman starts to think that Virgil is mad at Roman (for the need to go up to Nico), but Virgil isn't mad at Roman, hes just anxious, so Roman starts to slowly stop trying to help Virgil out, until he realizes why Virgil is acting mad when Roman and Thomas leave the bathroom (Virgil had left before them), Roman had realized that Virgil was seeing Thomas as Janus, and Virgil see's Janus as a villain, therefore seeing Thomas as a villain, and Virgil doesn't want to see Thomas as a villain, which is making him more anxious, and him not knowing how to process this all at once, making Virgil angry, because that's the emotion that most people show when theres to many emotions going on in their head(s),  so Roman decides to continue to help Virgil out, and the first thing that comes to his mind, is truth, so now Roman is also telling Thomas that lying is not the way to get through a relationship, and how badly it'll end About the fact that this video contributes to the SandersSides series, Nico might (probably will) be an important part of the SandersSides series, that's all I got for Nico, ill add stuff later if I think of it- About the fact that this video contributes to the SandersSides series, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN VIRGIL AND ROMAN JEEZ- When they get out of the bathroom, and Virgil (and Roman) talk to Thomas saying that lying isn't the way to go, when Thomas is walking away he says, "No he's better off without me," and like I said, walks away, you can tell that Virgil regrets what he just did, Virgil didn't mean for Thomas to give up on Nico (considering the fact that Virgil's also in love), and in that split second from when Thomas had said that, to when Nico came up to him, Virgil was full of regret, and misery Okayokay I just remembered what I was writing from yesterday, Virgil could've either been referring to Janus as 'deceit' because he doesn't know about the last SandersSides episode (which is what most of you seem to think), but it could mean that Virgil didn't wanna spill sh!t to Roman, because Virgil, Remus, and Janus used to spend a lot of time together (or still do who knows), and they probably knew each others names before hand, and Virgil thinks that Roman still doesn't know Janus' name, so Virgil doesn't say Janus, but deceit (Virgil being respectful uvu) VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGE COULD'VE ALSO BEEN HIS INNER LIGHT SIDE COMING OUT WHY AM I YELLING?
Boiled man carrots 😂😂😂😂😂
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYE SHADOW INSTEAD OF BLACK AND I LOVE IT!!!💜💜💜
Love how the strangers voice is actually Joan's voice XD
Virgil's not anxious for once and his eyeshadow turns PURPLE!? I'm totally gonna cosplay him!!
Well shi- im crying... But still having fan ship attack. My fander sense tingled while i was sleeping
I loved this episode!! It was too cute 🥺🥰 I loved the animation style too! Can’t wait for the next episode :D
Thomas: ah, can’t see what they are though, shoot  Roman: why? To forget your spectacles back at the retirement home? Go get a closer look!  Thomas: I can’t just go up to him and start silently reading his pins and buttons like it’s an exhibit at an art museum  Roman: well then just freaking go up to him. Tell him you like his buttons and ask him about them!  Virgil: that’s completely disregarding the purpose of the sticker button system. You see some buttons, you button it!  Roman: UGHHHH, pintroverts
THIS IS SO CUTE AND THIS IS THE HAPPIEST WE'VE SEEN VIRGIL DNDJJDKSKSKSUDHD
An upload!!!! 🥰
This is the cutest most amazing thing ever!!! The animatic was adorable and I'm so excited now!! ALSO! Virgil's eyeshadow kept switching between purple and black?? I love this so much!!! Ahhh! Virgil I'm so proud aww!! This was so cute!! <3
I think that with Detective Pikachu, the Sonic movie & now this Asides episode, it's fair to say that fanart is not such a waste of time as people say. It's giving creators a look good at their work in a different medium (whether it's giving the live-action treatment with Pokemon & Sonic or making the sides a cartoon) and it's giving artists more work that it can become a viable career for them just by drawing something they're passionate for. I not only commend Thomas & Crew for picking these icons in the fandom to work on this episode, but also to Kelly, Alex & Brei for doing an incredible job bringing these characters to life in animatic form. Starting as fans to becoming part of the team, incredible job to everyone for this amazing Asides episode!
Gay panic sucks. I hate it with a purple polkadotted passion.
THAT WAS SO CUTE WTF
I wanna read the comments but i'm not done the episode and i know the comments are full of spoilers lol
I love this.
I think we found the gayest video XD X3
How are you so amazing and wholesome I don't get it
_is this just a fanfic?_
this video alone saved 2020
you are the man thomas thx you finally a video
okokokok VIRGIL AT THE END FANGIRLING WHAT HAVE MY EYES BEEN BLESSED WITH?!
GERARD GAY
First, the last part (not post credit scene) was kinda princxanity, yes I can't spell shush Second, ORANGE IS BRAVERY! I'M CALLING IT!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
That moment when you spot a cute gay  Anxiety: I'm about to end this whole mans carrer
So basically....... Thomas oh so DESPERATELY needs a bf....... did I get it right?
YAY A NEW VIDEO!!!!!❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩
When you can’t join the Patreon because you literally only have a dollar because you spent all of your money at Hot Topic 💧👄💧
This video made my day
Deceit's name finally revealed!! XD i hope there's gonna be more episodes!
The actual lesson of this video was: ALWAYS FLUSH AFTER YOU’RE DONE WITH THE TOILET 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did Janus not pop up in that beginning scene
I am LIVING for the purple eyeshadow Virgil has going on at the end.
"If I'm wrong, just add it TO THE LIST!" Roman, why must you break me like this?
Am I the only one that screamed when Roman put his hand on Vrige's shoulder???
So we aren’t going to talk about Virgil’s raccoon eyes at all or...?
Oh Thomas, the fact that you uploaded today.......... We love an uplifting king!!!!!!
Who else lives in Australia and stayed up to 2:30am to watch it?
i feel so validated rn with the stims mention
But when he said you gotta do something with your hands I was like ME
YES!
You did just not- 6:48! ♡ And the whole episode itself melted my heart! We got to see how Roman and Virgil work together here and i live for it. (When Virgil saw Roman being sad so pushed Thomas to Nico to take a second chance, I barely could hold myself back from screaming!)
THE PRINXIETY IS RADIATING FROM THIS VIDEO
Ok this is awesome
just a small question was that a prinexiaty moment I saw at  19:39 ?
"...You saw me knock over that trashcan didn't you." "That was you?!" Loved that moment.
The prinxiety in this episode was immaculate
Yay new video!! 😊😊❤❤
OMG A VIDEO IM DYING OF HAPPINESS and I've been rewatching the whoke sanders sides series at least 7 times till i got a notification of the new episode
in the words of bill cipher:  “oh, it’s happening, it’s finally finally happening!”  i couldn’t watch it when it was released because i was at dance but oh well, i can watch it now!!  edit: the prinxiety hints in this episode has me SCREAMING. my brother asked me what was wrong and all i said was “prinxiety!!” and he started screaming with me, we were so excited
My little gay heart is on a sugar high with the gayness in this.
The eyeshadow changing color I'm LIVING
I haven't even watched the video yet and I'm already liking and sharing the video😅😂😆👍
Alternative title: Gay Panic ft. Virgil and Roman
Am I the only one crying, this like kinda hit home. The whole over thinking and being so awkward that you miss out on opportunities.
omg Virgil's eye shadow tho. o.o
“If you don’t have anything nice to say.... it’s because your a dirty liar” -Roman 2020
IM LATE NOOO
THE CUTEST THING A HAVE EVER WATCH!!!! and the smal VirgilxRoman at the end was great!

SO WHOLESOME SO WHOLESOME SO WHOLESOME!   Also, Virgil’s eyeshadow when he’s happy oh my gosh-
The attests are so talented! Love this. Also loves Virgil's sparkly eye-shadow when he's happy!
🎶"*No chance*, no way, I won't say it no, *no*."🎶
Wait so when Virgil is happy or like blushing his eyebags turn purple :o
I am so happy right now, because I can finally watch this. ✨
Happy Virgil with the light purple eyeshadow
My heart is malfunctioning aaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
Ahhh love it!!! Happy boys!!
"What are you doing?!"  "Idk plant"
"cutie at twelve ocklock"
"flirting with anxiety" had me thinking sir-sing-a-lot would be flirting with hot topic
I am sorry but I am freaking out at how Roman and Virgil might actually start being friends for once.       Sorry i mean        FINALLY
OMG OMG
Aww
FREE SEROTONIN!!! F R E E S E R O T O N I N!!!!!!!!
This was amazing xDDDD
I loved this so much!!!!!! NOT ONLY CAN I RELATE TO IT BUT ROMAN & VIRGIL'S FRIENDSHIP IS SO GOOD <333
7:21 Best part Edit: so is 19:30
His eye shadow! It went purple when he was excited and happy! Aaahhh
I miss sander sides so much
Isn't anyone gonna talk about virgils eye shadow going purple! Dose that mean when he's happy he's eye shadow changes couler.
Does anyone else picture Thomas dressing up as the sides to do the voiceovers so he can get into character?
omg. I saw this pop-up in my recommended and I thought I was really late. 😭 I’m not so.
AHHHHHHHH
Best birthday present ever thank you Thomas :)
OKAY WAIT IS IT BAD THAT I HAVE A SMALL THEORY THAT WHEN VIRGIL'S  EYESHADOW IS PURPLE ITS HIM BECOMING MORE OF A LIGHT SIDE AS HAPPINESS AND WHEN ITS BLACK HE IS MORE TO THE DARK SIDES AS ANXIETY AH I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS—
VIRGIIIIIIL!!! I missed him so muuuuuuch 😭😭😭😭😭😭💜💜💜💜 and I looove that when he's excited/happy his eyeshadows become purple 😍😍 this sanders aside was awesome, you guys! the animations were so cute!
Gay or European vibes...
20:01  **INTERNAL SCREAMING**
24:00 virgils deep voice OHAHAH DEMOND
I JUST FINISHED WATCHING AND IM FANBOYING AO MUCH AHHH I CANT
GERARD GAY AHAHAHAHSHSJSVA
Purple eye shaDOWWWW
Omg, why is this so relatable!? All the nervousness, second guessing, avoiding, rehearsing, etc. God, I know that feeling all too well, and I hate it. But sometimes you can't wait for someone else to notice that you're there, notice that you like them. You have to get the ball rolling yourself. And, its uncomfortable and nerve wracking, but it ends up being worth it in the long run. (Did that make any sense? I'm sorry if it didn't 😅)
My boyfriend and I stayed up till 2:30am to watch this and I fanboyed so much that I crushes his hand. I squealed and fanboyed so much, I love Roman and Virgil together cause they are a great dynamic and I can't function right now.
When virgil told Roman he was making a mistake....and Roman said I'll add it to the list😭😭😭😭😭 it's so sad
“You’re making a mistake!”-Virgil “If I am, I’ll add it to the list!”-Roman  I feel like this is 2020 summed up
can we all talk about how virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he's excited or happy?
happystimhourdskfmdksmgwmFWe,gmwmgf ALSO OH MY GOD THE END CARD WITH VIRGILS EYE SHADOW IS IT LIKE REPRESENTING THE TWO SIDES OF ADRENALINE LIKE HE ISNT JUST ANXIETY BUT LIKE IN CHARGE OF ADRENALINE AS A WHOLE SO WHEN THOMAS IS HAPPY HE BECOMES PURPLE BECAUSE HE IS SUPER EXCITED JCNSJHJSFNS ALSO OMG THE PRINXIETY VIBES AND I ALSO LOVE ALEX SO MUCH I JUST - AAAA THIS EPISODE MAKES ME SO HAPPY MAN :')!!
“i’m a triple expert- an ex-ex-expert” “easy tiger”  i-
I LOVE VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3<3<3
As a pintrovert, the whole reason we have pins is so someone can say "I like ur pin" and there's a built in conversation starter.
Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple ,that was an awesome touch
Im not crying nope not at all noppppe          Ok does anyone have a tissue?       Please?
Honestly now Thomas is just messing with the shippers
The art style was fantastic and the ending was spectacular!! This has been amazing!!! <3
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW THO-
WAIT AIT WAOT, VIRGIL HAS NEW EYESHADOW?!?!?!??   update: or nvm, ig it just changes when hes happy??
YO THE CHANGING OF THE EYESHADOW FOR VIRGIL WHEN HE WENT ALL ANXIOUS WAS POETRY I ADORE ALL OF ITTT
You can live like Jack and Sally if you want?? Yes - Blink 182!!
The people who disliked this were so busy doing the hand shake thingy that they misclicked
OMG IT’S HEEERRRREEEEEEEEE I haven’t even watched it whole yet lmaoo
I love this
Best episode yet, I loved happy virgil at the end! SHAKY HANDS ARE WHOLESOME
Awwwww I love this OwO
This perfectly describes what I have to live with. I also have also have social anxiety and dude it sucks. Me thinking I’m doing the right thing only to have my anxiety keep saying “WAIT!” Or “NEVERMIND!!!!” About everything. At work, at home, with my boyfriend. My life is a shadow of what it could be if I just didn’t have to go through social anxiety.
IM SORRY BUT THE WAY ROMAN LOOKED AFTER GLANCING AWAY FROM VIRGIL  HE'S SO IN LOVE WITH HIM  AND THE WAY VIRGIL LOOKED AT HIM IN THE ENDCARD SCENES THEY'RE SO IN LOVE
I used to watch these much more when I was younger but now it touches so close to home that it’s hard
WICKED!!!!!!!!!
Yessss! Virgil with purple eyeshadow and THEN IT FREAKING CHNAGED!!! . And he's soo adorable ^¬^
I am an XXXpert at failing universe tests
Oh my god. I know exactly how you feel Thomas. My heart fights the most with itself than anything, and it hurts so much but we need to find a moment that makes sense to talk to someone else.
Roman trying so hard to get *ONE* thing that he wants, since he lost the callback, Virgil working with and against him, and then Virgil pushing Thomas to get what he wants at the end because he saw Roman sad!!!!!! Gah!!!!! My heart! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💜🖤🖤🖤🖤💛💛💛💛💛💛

They got official purple eye shadow for Virgil now 💞💞💞
Roman: Just relax-  Virgil: *DONT TELL ME TO RELAX*
"So... like stalking?" "... oh you're RIGHT"  this is my favorite prinxiety dynamic i love this two idiots just playing volleyball with the braincell

*Prinxiety shippers are pleased*
OMG the amount of Virgil X Roman in this fejfebwfbdfbebfer
Omg this was adorable and flippen Prinxiety is true! Yaaaas! XD I’m so happy.  Edit: I’m happy that Virgil and Roman are getting along! Omg. Also this is adorable like omg. So ya! Hehe. I’m so excited for more Roman and Virgil videos!
MCR and Blink 182 references are making me understand why old men get that way about classic rock
Okay, so we were wrong about that gray piece of hair... but I'm not complaining-
so i've been theorizing on the new episode for 5 monthes and when it comes out it's just roman and virgil flirting     and i'm not mad
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!
Did I miss something or am I overthinking this cause Virgil had purple eyeshadow- and it kept going back and forth- Is that like excitement?- Isn't that Patton's thing?-  Or is the purple eyeshaodw Virgil becoming more and more apart of the light sides- apart of the group...  Also is the shaking and walking around Thomas had Virgil did happy stimming?-  I recognized it when Thomas was happy/excited and Virgil told his to wave his hands around cause they were 'just hanging there'-
*prinxiety shipper*: EEEEEEEEKKKKKKK
I could physically feel the awkwardness and it HURTS but boy Do I Love this
Virgil I missed you so much :D
The gayyy 🌈🌈🌈 This is way to relatable 😂
AHHH I am soooo excited!!!!   (Edit)(Aww Roman said if I am making a mistake I will add it to the list)(poor Roman) (Edit)(you can not tell me that this wasn’t a Virgilxroman video in disguise)  (Virgil’s EYESHADOW is amazing when he is optimistic!!!)
Virgil’s eyeshadow changing colors based on his mood is something I didn’t know I needed in my life!!
OOMGOSH THEY ARE CANAONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!! ALSO DOES TOMAS HAVE A BF NOW?!?! *ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*
*internal and external screeching*
This is keeping me sane during this crazy time
‘speaking from the heart’  *LAUGHS IN PATTON KINNIE*
g o d the second hand anxiety is KILLING me
VIRGILS EYESHADOW
I miss your vines I love this human
Was this supposed to make me cry?
Hi
I speak for my fellow Fanders when I say *VIRGIL*
.......Roman x virgil again uwu
Why is nobody talking about virgils a d o r a b l e purple makeup oh my god
Ok hear me out Virgil eyeshadow changes when he’s anxious or confident. Black for anxiety and purple for confidence. 😊💜🖤
Thomas forgot that as well as doing the gay eyes you do the gay wrist limp thing
I LOVE THE PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN VIRGIL IS EXCITED I LOVE IT
please tell me you're not the only one who noticed that when Virgil got super excited his eyeshadow turned from black to purple
Ooooh the bright pearlescent purple bags on Virgil's eyes when he is happy anxious and the deep matte black bags when he is bad anxious, it's such a cool touch!!!!
**starts getting pillows and blankets ready for the inevitable freak out of the Prinxiety fans**
“Janus’s patreon nah its mine      BUT JANUS IS RUNNING IT”
vIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYE SHADOW???? WHEN HES *HAPPY?* JAGSFLASGLSF
i did not think this was gonna be this deep when i opened the video
The olny thing that I can say is: ¡¡Wow!!
Most wholesome thing I've ever seen ❤ ❤
Casually wondering if this is a real story or not-
OH MY GOD VIRGILS EYESHADOW WENT PURPLE WHEN HE WAS EXCITED AND CHANGED BACK TO BLACK AT THE END AAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE ITTT SO MUCCCCHHHHHHH
P-p-p-p-p-PURPLE!!!!!!!!!! OMFG!!!!!!!!!! YES THE PURPLE EYESHADOW! OMGGGGGGGGGGG! And now i think people are going to take Princiety to a whole new level🤣.UGHHHHH i loved ittttttt!
SPOILER WARNING: WHEN ROMAN PUT HIS HANDS ON VIRGIL SHOULDER MY HEART!! 🥺💜❤️💜❤️💜
I'M EARLY FOR ONCE 😭👈🏻
VIRGIL VIRGIL I LOVE HIM  "WHAT ARE GAY EYES "  I AM CRYING ROMAN ROMAN I LOVE HIM  "IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY...YOUR A DIRTY LIAR" OMG OMG I LOVE THIS THOMAS YOU ARE THE BEST ALSO...JOAN I LOVE THAT  BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER!!!!!!!!!!
virgil's eye shadow seems to be purple when he gets excited or unusually positive
Sorry but 8:04    *virgil *x.x.x  Expert*   *roman*easy tiger*  Im sorry but I just died
Me: *reads title* Uh. Does that mean they're flirting with Virgil? What?     Me: *20 mins later, realizes* OH. It's flirting WHILE YOU HAVE Social Anxiety! OHHHHH! I have been reading too many fanfics lately XD
Prinxiety shippers will be all over this episode.
Omg tbe end card, virgil's eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black and im like holy heck thats what happens when virgil's overly happy
PRINCXIETY SHIPPERS ARE *QUAKING* RIGHT NOW
Just started the video and he looks really tired is he okay? I get really worried about people I like to watch/hang out with/whatever and He looks so tired- a
I'm Fangirling So BAD RIGHT NOW!!!😍😍😆😆
Is nobody gonna talk about the purple eyeshadow-
Notification gang
It's been a while!
And now we wait for....ze bloopers
Anxiety isn't just Anxiety. Anxiety knows how much Anxiety to put up and how much to let up. Even if He IS Anxiety... Virgil isn't just that. Just how Patton isn't just happy feelings. BUT STILL AWWWE THIS WAS SO AMAZING VIRGIL OUR DARK STRANGE SON 😭😭😭😭
"i tend to miss a lot of opportunities" "well let's not miss this one" i DIED that was SO SMOOTH
15:54 i literally yelled "D U D E" at my screen
We gotta love that the stranger  He told to go along with it was Joans voice
This is my new favorite episode so far, we finally get a explanation on how sides work in the outside world and the prinxiety moments were adorable.
i love that anyone screamed in gay, thomas you have a new boyfriend?
My gay panic attacking jut by me watching someone else's gay panic.. I feel too gay right now
*gay panic*
The slight Roman angst! Don’t think we didn’t catch those! Our precious Princey baby! (Also that anxiety impulse at the end. Thanks Virgil :) -❤️
AHHHHHHH
V I R G I L ' S  E Y E S H A D O W ?!?!??!?  IM DRAWING THATTTTT
HOLY CRAP MY HEARTTTTTTT!!!
The second hand embrassment was strong in this one- but it ended so cute!!
So if purple eyshadow means excitement, and black means anxiety... does this mean Virgil is in control of Thomas's perspective? Pessimism vs Optimism?
EXTREME SQUEE MODE ACTIVATED!
Me: **E p i c      f a n g i r l i n g**
omg i love this so much! Virgil with the eyeshadow  Roman over here like : could be gayer! Im kinda sad that Patton or Logan didn't come but i love the janus's stuff its awesome!  also i wanted to ask you if you could answer this question : what house do you think remus and janus would be in? i just thought of it when you were saying janus merch, and the behined the sence video's!
Did anyone else noticed that vergil’s eye makeup changed every time during the ending scene?
What's up with the eyeshadow?! Virgil's eyeshadow was purple whenever he got optimistic and it went dark when he was anxious, W H Y?!
Question for Thomas and gang: Should I stop my Membership sub for the Patreon, or should I keep both? Will you keep doing the YT membership stuff?
22:00 "oh beauty is sparred in the court of food      NO EFFIN WAY, DUDE!"
THIS WAS SO CUTE SJFJNSJSKDKD

VIRGIL CARES ABOUT ROMAN I CANT
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGILS EYESHADOW??? THE WAY IT TURNS A SHINEY PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY AND BLACK AGAIN WHEN HES ANXIOUS??? AAAA I LOVE HIM SMMMMM
Virgil's growth in this video was amazing- 🥺  Also, to everyone who worked on this animatic episode, you all did a wonderful job-- the artists and to the people who eho worked on other aspects too! This episode, even though shorter than the others, has definitely become a personal favorite of mine! 💕
This.  Was.  A M A Z I N G.
I'm dying after this episode 🥰🤩😍 Am I the only one that want to see  this like not a cartoon but in real
ah this is so adorable! i relate so hard. and i needed this after the angst in the last sanders sides episode
OMG YY FINALLY A NEW SANDER SIDES
I cant believe im a pin-trovert
I kind of NEED to see this filmed now
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW KEPT GOIBG FROM SPARKLY LIGHT AND DARK PURPLE TO BLACK!!! IT DOES THAT?!?!
This video really hit me like it really resonated with me and I decided to take the push and we've been together for 9 months and I feel like I made a really good choice and watching this really made feel like made the right choice
I’m sorry I’m late! I had to work and I wasn’t able to watch TwT I’m so excited
OMG IT'S OUT
This was truly a masterpiece 🥺
For once i actually dont think it could get gayer Nah it always could
It’s finally here!
OH MY GOD VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN HE'S EXCITED?? TODAY IS A _BLESSED_ DAY INDEED
AAAAAAAAHHH!!!! Fangurking because the cud is finally here!!
Roman and Virgil give me vibes of that typical duo from tv shows that was meant to be togheter since beginning of series,but they are still not
This video was an entire mood that described how badly I am with making friends or flirting 😂
Anyone going to talk about how Virgil’s eyeshadow changes to how he’s feeling or did I just see that and I’m crazy
The eyeshadow changing with Virgil's mood. I love it!! Also, I have heightened anxiety, and social anxiety is a big part of it. I used to think I was just shy, but when I noticed my Fight or Flight response was being triggered, I realized it was more than that. I'm working on it, but if today was any indication of my progress, it isn't much better than it was. I won't stop trying, though. Much love to the Sanders team and fam. Take it easy guys, gals and non-binary pals. ❤💛💚💙💜 Peace out!
Is Virgil's eyeshadow going to be purple from now on? Because that's awesome. Also, never thought I'd feel this much second-hand embarrassment from one video...
Me crashing and burning every time I try to flirt with... anyone. literally anyone. That is my love life in a nut shell.
Is Thomas really gay or is this one of his jokes
My Prinxiety heart is SCREAMING
I love the purple eyeshadow
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH           IT WAS SO CUTEEEE!          VIRGIL'S EYESHADOWWWWWW IT WAS ADORABLE!!!!! 💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤

Virgil: in all honesty I really don’t know what that was Roman: bravery That just made my day❤️

Please tell me this is sorta real? It's too cute
OMG I LOVE IT Roman+Virgil for life MAKE THEM A THING PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ❤️
When you watch ALL of the ads till the end because you want Thomas to get some semblance of compensation for how amazing a video this was

Virgil - "don't tell me to relax"
I absolutely LOVED this video!! The artists did such a good job on animating this!! Thomas and the Team did a fantastic job at this!   In love with the stimming that you guys added in. That part made me so happy. Also, Virgil's eyeshadow! Ahh! And Roman being the himbo he is. ❤ This video just made me so flipping happy. ^-^
2:24 this is when the animation starts :D     EYESHADOW ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS EYESHADOW
I enjoyed this so damn much, you guys all did such a good job!
i love this! i love this so much!!!!!!!
Awww Virgil's eye shadow goes purple when he's happy!!!<3
17:08 KEEP WATCHING AND YOU GET PRINXIETY MOMENT!!!!!! 19:38 SAME HERE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙌👏🙌👏🙌👏
*screams in Prinxiety*
Oh gods I wish we could like more than once
Tomas has a boyfriend now???
Why is no one talking about virgil's purple eyeshadow it's perfect!
Thomas:”Nothing but a bruised ego” Roman:”hm.” 19:13
I wish I could join the patreon so muchhhhh. But this video was amazing! As always 😀
roman  called virgil by his   name- that's a first
WAIT THOMAS SAID “YOU TOO” JUST LIKE ONE OF HIS OLD VINES
Thomas is talking to himself in public now? jesus Christ Thomas
Virgil's eyeshadow at the end: purple Me: ooooo it's purple.... Wait IT'S PURPLE (excited yet confused pterodactyl noises)
"what are you doing!" "I don't know... Plant?" Also this is so cute
My Voice has never been so high pitched..... I literally squealed when I saw the ending and my brother looked at me like I was crazy
*22:35* - Omg, hasn't anyone notice Virgil wears glitter under his eyes when he's excited!?!? Fuking adorable!
Oh heck yeah 😆💖
are we going to ignore virgil's eyeshadow changing colors when he's truly happy or-
Heck Yea!!!!!!!!
OMG AH HELP MY HEARTTTTTT
Asides
Friend:why are you on the ground? Me:you already know- Friend:you watch something ga- Me:I watchedsomethinggaythatilladorefortherestofmylife
“Tell him he’s a textbook cutie pie!” “You CANNOT tell him he’s a textbook cutie pie!” The arguments/conversations between Roman and Virgil are incredible in this one 😂
Okay- absolutely loved the little prinxiety in that episode,  and uhhhh- I kinda need to ask you something thomas for an assignment im doing-?  Uhm....how do you feel you learn best..?
UGH IM AN HOUR LATE WHYYY
PRINXIETY FANS WHERE ARE YOUUUUU???!?!!!??   IM GOING CRAZY!!!!!!
Prinxiety was so god damn close
AaAaA I've been waiting SO LONG for this video to come out. My prinxiety heart is ABOUT TO EXPLODE  Also can I just add that I love Virgil having purple eyeshadow when he's happy
I'm I the only waiting for roman and virgil to have a kissing scene but it never happened
I LOVE animatics! This was such a great idea!
Yall I noticed something. In the ending clip, when Thomas and the guys got back home whenever Virgil was excited, his undereye makeup was a sparkly purple, but when Thomas tweets that really cheesy tweet, his makeup goes back to black. when Thomas deletes it Virgil then has purple referencing his small bit of panic. I'm guessing his makeup reflects his feelings :) good job, Sanders Sides team on that little detail.   edit: in fact, its anytime Virgil has a mood swing in this scene.
This is so real, exactly my experience, and I loved the references thrown in the mix
Virgil: you're making a mistake!! Roman: *if i am, I'll add it to the list!*  That hit me... roman has a list... what do y'all think what's on that list
"You're making a MISTAKE!" "If I am, I'll add it to the LIST!!" ... Roman, honey, you good?
In a weird way this was comforting knowing that there is hope for my awkward butt too.... yknow if id go out sometimes lmao
Don't mind me, I'm just going to rewatch this 500 times
why is virgil not remembering/knowing the word stalking but knowing cyber stalking literally me
I AM HYPERVENTILATING WHAT WAS THAT THOMAS THAT WAS AWESOME VIRGIL WE MISSED HIM WHAT THE HECKKKK
This vide makes me so gosh darn happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
19:59 ITS HAPPENING EVERYBODY STAY CALM I SAID STAY F****** CALM
WAIT ITS GOING TO BE ANIMATED DKKVKEVKJDCJ Edit: i havent watched it yet btw lmao
I see myself in this post and i don't like it XD
As someone with social anxiety this speaks to me on a personal level
SANDERR SIDESS VIDEOOO IS OUTTT AND IVE BEEN SLEEPINGGG..
I’m fourteen (turning fifteen in six days) and the gay eyes... Thomas don’t stare at the people! You’re meant to show interest without looking like you’re desperate. (Also! I know I’m young! And I’ve never personally done it to anyone because I’ve never found anyone worth doing it to! I have had this done to me!)   Okay! Here’s what you do: *with a soft smile you watch them. (If it starts to feel like it’s taking a while, take some breaks from staring at the person until they look somewhere in your direction) Once they make eye contact with you you smile a bit wider to show you’re looking at them. (Thomas! He turned to make sure you were looking at him! Don’t break eye contact after that happens!) don’t let the eye contact linger! Once the eye contact is issued you look down their figure and back up to their eyes. Give a final smirk as you look away. (Have something to look at ready! Like your phone!) Here’s the hard bit! The energy you give off during this, will push the situation either way. Always! Attempt to do this with a friendly (/good intentions) energy!   Oml! People (especially my introverts) practice your smile in a mirror! Yea it can be a bit weird but it helps for when the day comes! (Good luck people!) -❤️
When ur broke 👁💧👄💧👁
NSJSNSINDIWMS
.... More roman x virgil stories and art are going to be coming out of this video
Virge: "Its like cyber stalking" Roman "soo.... stalking..?" Virge: "...." Virge: "OH YOUR RIGHT"  YES
Is it just me or did Virgil's eyeshadow change from purple in the beginning of the endcard to black at the end of it? I think I'm being overly attentive of details again halp-
HE HAD PURPLE SPARKLY EYESHADOW CAUSE HE WAS HAPPY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Roman : no thinking. Logan coming out of nowhere : *excuse me, what?*
PRINXIETYYYYY AAAAAAAAAAHHH MY SHIPPP
This is just an episode for all the prinxety shipers also did anyone else notice Virgil's eye shadow change i absolutely loved that
This was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life oh my goodness-
It didn’t take you a year to make another video yayyyy!!!!!!
yall seien virgils make-up change👁👁
Roman: What are you doing!?  Thomas: i dUnNo PLANT :”0????
19:55 okay did Thomas think we weren’t gonna see the prinxiety there- BECAUSE ROMAN AND VIRGIL WERE BLUSHING AND THERE WERE HEARTS
i love the eyeshadow bit but IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE GODDAMN HEARTS. THE HEARTSSSSSSS. IN THE ANIMATION BIT. MY PRINXIETY HEART. ALSO confirmed himbo
Me, working on English Essay, trying not to cry Me, sees new SS episode: "WHo needs good grades anyways...?" Me: *proceeds to watch new SS episode 3 times and panics with every akward moment because MOOD*
My throat hurts from hOW MUCH I HECKIN S C R E A M E D DURING THIS AAAAAAAAAA!!!!
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW LET ME S O B
Oh ho ho- virgils eyeshadow switching from black to purple is very interesting indeed
Who clicked on for princes and Virgil shipped
I just started watching this and it's beautiful
omg this just made me ship prinxiety harder omg i just can't
This doesnt relate at all to the video but i just wanted to say my budgies really like your intro music thing.
I love this!!!!!!!
Aww! Did anyone else see that Virgil's eye shadow switches from purple when he's excited to black when he gets anxious? Such a cute thundercloud!
Why do i literally relate to all that's happening here??
VIRGIL IM SO PROUD UHYDUBLNKVH
the amount of serotonin this video gave me ;u;
*I am scared by the lack of prinxiety comments-*
I'm worried Nico isn't real.
I would love to see this like a normal sander sides but this was amazing I loved it :D
so virgil's eye shadow changes colour based on how he's feeling? It was purple when he was feeling good, but when he started feeling anxious again it turned black
:0
Best end card ever omg <3
MY GAY BABIES ARE BACK
Can we just acknowledge Virgil's eyeshadow changing from black to purple please!
ok but i love that ending with virgil, roman, and thomas freaking out because my brain also just confusedly screams after going to a social event that was scary but also exciting
I SCREAMED VAUSE YOU POSTEFD BUT THEN I SCREAMED CAUSE THW TITLE THEN I SAW THE THUMNAIL THEN I-   EDIT: I FINISHED THE VIDEO I'M ENTERNALLY SCRREEEEEEECHING
yesssssss, i screamed when the notification popped up
awwwwww this episode was adorable
AAAAAA Single Pringle no longer. He's now a Taken Taki
I looked up “adorable” in the dictionary and got a link to this vid....I’m not complaining
OMG ERIN KELLY NO WAY
Wait is nobody noticing Virgil's eyeshadow?????
“You’re gonna have to try speaking from the heart”    I thought Patton was gonna pull up
I love Virgil’s Euphoria-esk eyeshadow when he’s happy! 💜🖤
Thomas: being my type BUT.. Is gay :>
HES BACK THOMAS HES BACK (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)
The $5 tier "The Federal Education Budget" XD XD XD That's one way to make statement.
I SCREAMED
WHOA HOLD ON END CARD VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW- WHATTTT
The fanders are screaming right now
22:35 OHHHHHHHH THAT LOOKS GREAT
Oh my gosh!!!! This was crazy good. I loved how Virgil's makeup kept changing at the end to show how mixed his emotions are when good things happen. And I love seeing Virgil with purple sparkly eyeshadow.
GERARD GAY OMG
The second hand embarrassment is real
I would like to say something: exactly one week ago, i had a dream where the next episode was animated and when i saw this at first, i was shocked. Did my dreams tell the future?
4:22 Poor Roman’s artistry isn’t appreciated in his time
why were yopu not posting??
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍😍😄😄😄😄😄😃😄😃😄😃😃😃😃😃😃
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ME LOVE THIS EEEEEEEEEK
OH MY GOD MY HEART THIS IS TOO DAMN PURE So this is Prinxiety being wholesome for 20 minutes
HHHHHH BAAAABIESSSS THAT WAS SO CUTE!!!!!!
The end "DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX!"
Finally it has returned!
We all saw the thumbnail                                                                                                  Princeixty shippers unite
Thomas if you’re saying Virgil’s eyeshadow turns purple when he’s excited I- IM LOSING MY MARBLES
VIRGIL PUSHING HIM BECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT ROMANHDHWUNSYSNSUSN
HE FINALLY UPLOADED
When the guy started walking away I kept saying “go after him! Tell him wait! You can still talk!!!!”
Ok my sibling in law Alex said that she cried over this and related to it and now I can see why, this was amazing and so frickin wholesome and emotional, I just can't rn!
He sounded like elidibus from ffxiv when he said final form!!!
IM LATE BC I WAS ASLEEP NOOO but anyways i already love it
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYY JOY!
ITE BEEN SO LONG FANDERS, SO LONG. HOW ARE YALL?
Omg Virgil’s purple eyeshadow 😍
Okay, hear me out. A Sanders Sides game. It could be digital or a board game, but a game! I’m not sure about game mechanics or anything, but yeah! Thomas, I hope you see this! I love your content✨✨
Be like Roman  *No thought, head empty*
Virgil's eyeshadow changes to reflect his mood. I noticed that when he questioned "what if things are never the same again?" he had the purple eyeshadow meaning he was genuinely excited for what would come next. We've never seen this meaning he's never been this happy (that we've seen.)
Thomas uploaded?!? This day just got 10 times better! 😁
This was amazing, beautiful, truly a masterpiece! Thomas, you managed to amaze me once again! And I just love the animations! They're perfect! You made my bad week have a little sunshine and I'm grateful for it! Thank you, Thomas and have a great day!
So our boyo has a crush now huh??
I love it
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW OMGGGGG
“If I am, I’ll add it to the list!” Oh roman
Omg I've just been smiling so hard for the last half hour! I absolutely love this and just MY HEART- This has made my day!!
OMG ITS HAPPENING
Virgils eyeshadowwwwwwwwww
Does this mean prinxcity is real
Poor baby bean , that is me anytime talking to anyone
I'm crying because he's growing so much.... his channel has gotten so much love and I'm so happy for him
Roman and Virgil call Thomas a liar a LOT during the opening of this video. Are they salty about Janus being accepted??
OH MY GOSH THE EYESHADOW-
OH MY GOSH! WAS THAT A HINT OF PRINXIETY?!?!?! IT BETTER BE CAUSE OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!   I love how at the end Virgil's eyeshadow changes from purple to black! I AM IN AWWWWEEEEE
Virgil's eyeshadow quickly switching from purple to black in sync with his emotions?? that is some thoughtful stuff, my dudes
I'm literally crying over the fact that Thomas has a patreon and I'm not allowed to join... I-I wanna be a part of the famILY...
Virgil's eyeshadow? AMAZING
His eye shadow changed to purple and black
bro you hear voices too
*screams*
virgil and roman are giving me such big gay vibes together-  ALSO DID THEY BLUSH WHEN ROMAN TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER OR AM I SEEING THINGS
imagine him seeing this video
4:00 16:00
Can we talk about how Virgil's under eye makeup is Purple when he is happy??
AS SOON AS I THOUGHT I WAS DONE WITH PRINXIETY THIS PULLLS ME BACK IN
Amazing!!!
Character Thomas is such a walking DISASTER
THIS WAS UPLOADED 1 HOUR AGO WHAT???
Hey guys, what's with the purple pink blush in the endcard on Virg? Is it just like blush cause he's actually happy and not panicking for once or smt else? Adhd is that you?
EVERYTIME THE PURPLE EYESHADOW CAME ON I GOT SO HAPPY! It’s like anxiety is...excitement! Gosh but he just looks so hopeful and I am loving this for him!!
11:10 oh god the secondhand embarrassment is kicking my ass lmao
This video was all I could ask for and MORE!! Erin, Alex and Brei are all incredible! I really can't describe how much I love this video...
That was painfully adorable
Me: notice that thomas has a *gay panic*
I love it when the potential partner says “I was afraid you left” and the two sides take it so differently like Roman’s thinking “He’s noticed you! He wanted to talk to you!” And Virgil’s like “HE’S AFRAID? YOU’RE AFRAID! WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON!!” 😂
🥺🥺🥺 YES SANDERS SIDE IS BACK!
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADPW WHEN HES HAPPY IM SCREAMING
12:17
When Virgil is happyyy his eyeshadow goes puuurpleeeee💜💜💜💜 we neeeed more happy virgil... P L E A S E
Does the eyeshadow color change because of virgil's mood.. ? (at the end and at 23.17 it's black again)
It was so good! Is Virgil’s eyeshadow changing a symbol of him switching types of anxiety?
WOW what a good day for prinxiety shippers :'))))
Minimal angst? Didn't know you had it in you, Sanders
Do my ears deceive me or when Roman was talking about tickets to France, did anyone else hear him say Fib-ruary? Or is that just how he said February?
I love that Virgil now has a shimmery purple eye shadow when he's feeling happy or non anxious and his regular black shadow when he's feeling anxiety
wish that was me rjrkrk
This story gave me more dopamine than anything else in the last half year. Like.... This isn't even my romance that I'm watching xD (and I'm currently on a steady way to getting a girlfriend so tf?)
"Feeling like a trash bin" **Strange giggling in Remus kinnie**
Ok guys- WHEN WAS THE EYE SHADOW? I DONT SEE IT
The way roman said "cutie at 12 o clock." Just FELT that.  Edit, GERARD GAY.
accurate... just accurate
Y'ALL I LITERALLY JUST WOKE UP AGGAEVS
HIS HAPPY SPARKLE EYELINERRRRRRRR AAAAA VIRGILLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
NICO What a great name!!!!
Orrrr u could use ⚡️✨❤️ *THE GAY HAND* ❤️✨⚡️
VIRGILSLMSHWHWJSBNDD
VIRGIL HAS COLOR CHANGING EYESHADOW VIRGIL HAS COLOR CHANGING EYESHADOW
CAN WE JUST APPRECIATE VIRGIL'S PURPLE SPARKLEING EYE SHADOW??!!?           He looks ADORABLE and BEAUTIFUL in that!!!!!
Roman: If he's ready (for a relationship), we're ready.  Virgil: *Longingly looks at Roman*  MY HEART  A C H E S
Me sees this:... Me: .............................RREEEEEEEEE FINNAAALLLLLYYYYUUUUYYT
I REALLY WANNA JOIN THE PATREON BUT IM BROKE AAAAAA
*gay happiness
This is my favorite episode to date. I love this so much and needed this after what 2020 has done! LOVE YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 😍😭❤️💜💖
well... i cried  loved this one! <3  Edit: also, that virgil make-up change?? daaamn
22:50 purple, 23:04 black... The Gay eyes.... I need to practice those!
glad to know I'm not the only one who does the hand wavey thing-
I mean, the beginning of this episode is basically just the Sanders Sides rendition of Gay or European.
"I do tend to waste a lot of opportunities in my life..."  "Well, let's not waste this one."  *Roman and Virgil proceed to fangirl*    I'M SMILING TOO MUCH SOMEONE HELP
IS MY BOY FINALLY GETTING A BOYFRIEND  AND IS ROMAN OK I NEED TO OF MY INSECURE CHILD IS OK
I’m dying I’m dying I’m dead. Oh my gosh I can’t I literally cannot deal with the cute and the prinxiety and the eyeshadow someone please hug meeeee!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈😍😍😍🥰🥰
Okay so... what I’m getting is that Virgil’s eyeshadow is a tell of Thomas’s Anxiety level, and what kind. Purple, sparkly, and bright is Love Anxiety, and Black (varying amounts) means just normal anxiety, so... that means that Thomas’s anxiety has been getting worse throughout the series....
my heart right now: 👁️💧👄💧👁️
me when i finished the episode: *sighs* time to rewatch it 20 more times
Virgils purple  eye shadow in the end card ❤❤❤❤ XD I LoVe It So MuCH
I’ve missed you Thomas!!
"I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" Omg Broadway and MCR? That quote is a prinxiety fusion
Me: *Sees the title of the video* Prinxiety has drop in everyone 💜❤️
Ah more fuel for the ship I see
Did anxiety always have purple eyeshadow? Also is this before or after putting others first redux?
I'm literally freaking the hell out! New sander sides time!
T-T i sadly cant join patreon but i love this video Thomas! Glad you and other youtubers have come together to make this! You guys have a bunch of talent. Tbh i sorta wish to be you 😅😅 you are one of my idles and i hope to be like you someday! have a good day everyone! wait who would dislike this masterpiece? Edit: Hey Thomas! I have a song that you might want to sing! I would love for you and the team to sing this: https://youtu.be/QeXUFKS-nYk Hope you see this!
This makes me ship Prinxiety 10 times more than I already do!😊

HI IM SOBBING THIS EPISODE MADE MY WHOLE MONTH AHHHHH
Thomas I beg of you if you see this make a princxity episode pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
NOW I'M SCREAMING
SO, frantic and exited Virgil has purple eye shadow meaning kinda like fluffy gotta move around anxiety, while the black eye shadow is more serious, and scared anxiety. This is amazing and i cannot what for this to be incorporated in cosplay and in the series!!!
Virgil has purple eyeshadow now
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING JFHDJS
ok but I REALLY WANT THE JANUS TEE SHIRT
5:32 Did Virgil do the stretchy arm or am I just seeing things?
virgil and roman: *breathes in sync*  prinxiety shippers: *OMG REEEEEE THEYRE SO CUTE TOGETHER THEY BREATHED OMGGGG*
I’d love to see this live wowowowow it would be so nice but the art style is pretty too
my cheap non-waterproof eyeliner is RUNNING I love this so much my heart is so full!! THANK YOU FOR THIS I'M GOING TO TRY TO STOP CRYING NOW!!!
ROMAN TOUCHED VIRGILS ARM WE FINALKY SEE THEM IN TGE SAME FRAM
thank you for free serotonin mr. sanders :')
The prinxiety moment at the end 💀✨
THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTE I AM DEAD AJJXNABXNS
the gay eyes part got me u dont understand how many times ive done this instead of actually interacting with a cute girl.
Why did Virgil's eyeshadow keep changing from black to purple in that end bit?
Okay 1. PRINXIETY 2.the fact that Virgil not knowing what gay eyes is lead me (a Prinxiety shipper if you're not, then insert your ship) to think that Roman been giving him gay eyes and Virgil just didn't know what it means. and 3. WE NEED SHIP NAME PEOPLE THOMAS AND NICO!! WOOOO!!!
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER. AND I HAVE A NEW CRUSH
Awwwwww, I loved it! Thomas, you and your crew did such an amazing job! Keep up the great work!
I just had to pause the video sometimes and just think to myself: "Thomas, you absolute ball of awkward sunshine and cute little rainbows....what are you doing?"  Edit: ....did anyone else notice that Virgil's eyeshadow changed depending on his mood?
i had to take a moment to physically pause just for the "sorry to rain on ur black parade, gerard gay" it was just so funny??
I WAS BROUGHT BY RANDOM FANDOMS THANK YOU RANDOM FANDOMS FOR BRINGING THIS MASTERPIECE TO ME!!!
That final scene in the animatic:  Me: Looks like Virgil knows what gay eyes are now.
The prinxiety radiates from this animatic
OKAY SO WAIT, WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY, HIS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE AHHHHHHHHHH THATS SO CUTE
DAAWWWWW HAPP VIRGIL IS THE CUTEST ONG
Virgil "Don't Tell Me To Relax" Sanders
Has anyone else realize that when Virgil starts to be doubtful or anxious or mad his eye shadow is now black but when he's excited / happy kinda mostly excited his eye shadow is purple I don't want to realize that
Roses are red good morning fellow fanders i came to say just like me ik your favroite YouTuber is Thomas sanders! Have a great day everyone❤.
I used to hate Prinxiety... this episode completely changed my view.
I love the  purple in Virgil`s eyeshadow and how it keeps changing :3
I love this! However my argument to myself is “he probably is gay and therefore I have no chance” but do the same steps that you do haha
*im trying to contain my happiness-* *it’s too cute*           edit: its my 5th time here- im obsessed-
VIRGIL PURPLE EYE SHADOW!   I saw it get darker when he got anxious. So does that mean purple eyeshadow is him being happy and te darker it gets the more anxious he is? OH THAT"S SO COOL
Nod to Janus!  Nod to Janus!  Nod to Janus!
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH THAT WAS AMAZING GUYS And you have a Patron now, that's awsome
"Stop raining on his black parade Gerard gay"
The way virgil's eyeshadow changed in the end credits, I think we are in for one hell of a sander sides episode. Not only did it go from purple to black, but it was Vigil's room black. Like.... I am not ready for my baby boy to get hurt just yet.
Awww, this was really cute and amazing! Everyone involved did a really good job and I cannot wait to see the other version (well...I’ll *have* to wait obviously but uh...you know what I meant.) It warmed my little lonely and socially anxious bisexual heart!
when he said "flirting with anxiety" my first thought was: "Roman did whAT nOw-"
"what are you doing"   "I dunno....   Plant?"
Oh my gosh, this was just to darn cute! I love this so much *^* I really do hope something similar to that will happen to you, or it already did. If it did be prepared to be shipped with him by me *^*
PRINXIETY STANS WE HAVE BEEN  F E D
At the end virgil eyeshadow kept changing but I kinda liked it.... im weird
At the end virgil eyeshadow kept changing but I kinda liked it.... im weird
I really like the art in this. Its lovely.
Omg that was the cutest thing I've ever watched 🥺
Can I just, like real quick. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! THIS WAS AN AMAZING EPPISODE
THIS WAS SI GOOOOD
Virgil: You see some buttons, you button it. Me: What does that have to do with finding out if he’s gay!?!🧐
Omg this was worth the wait. I literally sat next to my phone all day waiting for it mmmmmmmmm  Also the spying thing I always did to be nice. Like I would stare and find something I like then go up and talk to them about it or at least lay the comment out there
Another Sander Sides FINALLY
I just wanted to say this video really speaks out to me...talking to people...trying to fin love...I’m really happy you made this video cause it shows that I’m not alone!Also, when Virgil’s happy it turns to a shimmery light purple but when he’s himself it’s black!
"Stop, get out, the episode is over!" 😂
I skipped dinner for this episode and I will never ever regret that. Holy shiitaki mushrooms I think I have a new favourit episode💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💖💖💖💖💖💖💜💜💜💜💜❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Now I need my pillow so nobody can hear me screaming in it of happynes😆😆😆😆😆
“will deceit be the answer to ALL your problems?”  janus in the background like-  (• - •)
Awwh, so cuuuute, happy ending yay UwU 💕
The pure serotonin this gave me is 😩👌
This is the best prinxiety moment 19:38 it is so cute bruhh btw I love your vid Thomas awesome job :)
Stop giving me confidence to ask a girl out Thomas, that's not good, you're dangerous  (LOVED THIS VIDEO BTW I CAN RELATE SO HARD, THE GAY PANIC IS REAL)
Is no one going to talk about how happy Virgil was at the end?! We've never seen him like this before and now we've found out that, when Virgil is happy, his eyeshadow changes purple! Not to mention he had some major character development in this! It's also really nice to see Roman doing better since the last episode and after what happened.   Y'all done a fantastic job on this episode! We all understand why this episode took a while to come out, but it was certainly worth the wait!  Have a nice day/night/whatever time frame you are in right now! Bye!
I.....I. ...I LOVE IT!!!!!! THAT WAS ONE OF THE CUTEST THINGS I EVER FRIGGIN SEEN <3
THIS MADE ME SMILE AND FANGIRL SO HARD AM JUST SO SO HAPPY . THANK YOU THOMAS!
Wait so now that Thomas has patreon, what's happening with the membership subscribes?
VIRGILS BACK!!
... I'm fricking sorry but OMG Virgil is all over the place he had purple eyeshadow PURPLE. He was super happy then worried and oh my all over the place... I related way to much to this ;-;
I'm surprised that I didn't see Patton in this video... He is pretty much the heart
This entire vid is gay panick
PURPLE EYESHADOW
*I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY*
Yo what's going on with Virgil eyeshadow
I'm satisfied this made me smile and also made my day thank you Thomas 😊😊😊
Fanfiction writers: let's get writing bois-
Thomas: *to a random dude* "Top of the mornin  to ya" me: is that a jacksepticeye refinance? if it is then YES
Ok.... I'm rewatching the video  (because it is amazing) and I realized something. ROMAN CALLS VIRGIL CUTE!!!! ❤💜 When they talk about gay eyes. T: Gay eyes? R: Gay eyes V: Alright. What are gay eyes? R: oh oho. How cute  SEE!!! ❤💜❤💜
“I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay”   THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT I’VE EVER HEARD 😂😂😂😂
Did you all notice that at the end when Virgil was excited and happy his eyeshadow was purple And kept switching between black and purple according to his mood?
My favorite YouTuber posts and it’s in an animatic?! This is the best day ever. XD
So thomas says this is an important episode for the overall story, and i didn't get why until the end. It's something to do with Virgil's part in it all, his eyeshadow, the way he looks like he's having a realisation. Before the demon-   But yeah, i'm gonna start my theories now i know it, this is interesting though!
yo i felt this video my heart was literally trembling
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
I was being a third side in this ep-
The goddam boiled carrots
Has anyone notice Anxiety’s eyeshadow changed when he’s happy?!!!!
Virgil: *screaming of excitement*   Me: My wonderful cute shadowling is Happy!!!! Cuuuuute!!!!!     edit: Did anyone notice Virgil's eye shadow changed from light purple to black a couple times? So cool!
🥺😍❤️😍
Is this his way of letting us know he not so single anymoreeee...👀👀👀
Reminder for prinxiety shippers to tag their posts in their excitement! Have fun shipping guys
*laughing silently and nervously*
AWwWwW I just finished it this was so cute
Hold up- in the non-animated bit Virgil's eyeshadow kept going from an iridecent purple to just black.. I might be over thinking but the iridecent was there when Virgil was happy? Or excited.
OH YESSSSS JUSTT SAW THIS CAME OUT 😀
Is this real? Does that person exist? THOMAS ARE YOU GETTING A BOYFRIEND? Please be real
OPTIMISTIC VIRIGL WITH PURPLE GLITTERY EYESHADOW IS MY FAVORITE THING AND I LOVE HIM💜💜💜💜🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I LOVED THIS! VIRGILS CHANGING EYESHADOW, ROMAN CALLING VIRGIL EMO BUT NOT IN A MEAN WAY, VIRGIL HAD THOMAS DO THE FLAPPY ARM STIM, AND THOMAS LISTENS TO PARAMORE?!?!? ADGFHRDURSRJZJFXJDB
*Starts crying at the end when Thomas and Niko(if I hear right) started talking*
bruh roman and virgil were so cute at the end. like omg. this video made me so happy. oh my gosh!
I'm not lying when I clicked faster than janus lies. also virgils purple eye shadow!!!

Nobody: Me (And a lot of other people apparently): Virgil with happy purple eyeshadow and eyeliner make heart go brrrrrrr
i loves thissss thank you thomas
“Stop being fake with the plastic plant” LMAO I DIED XD 😂
THE CHANGE OF VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW MAN!!!!!
I love these boys and Thomas so much that I literally starting sobbing when I finally got to see them again. I missed them so much.
2020 has just been getting better holy crap Like MY PRINCEXITY HEART
Thomas is gay for someone and Virgil and Roman are gay for each other.
"You have five seconds max." "Wh- I'm not Max! I'm Prince Ro-" "No, man!" "Uh, it's RO-man... with an R? *sigh* you're really struggling today!" "But you don't know if he's NOT gay!" "Pintrovert" "Gay eyes" "I'm like a triple expert! An ex-ex-ex-pert!" "I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking" "Hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" "I dunno, plants?" "Captain blunderpants!" 12:13 - all the bird puns are wonderful "That's like cyberstalking... but in real life" "So,,, stalking?" "......OH you're right!" (Virgil spends too much time online lmao) "I gotta stop wooing strangers in bathrooms"  There are so many good lines in this episode!!! And in every other episode! Welp, all the more possible references for me to make! Please comment other good lines I missed- this is getting too long lol!
GOD THIS EPISODE WAS GREAT! ANAMATIC DEFINITELY ALLOWS MORE FREEDOM WITH CONTENT
I’m crying- 😫😫💖
OMG Virgils EYESHADOW CANGESSSSSSSSSSSSSRJDBVFJWJSCE IHFHFBFJFB THIS IS AMAZING
YAY!! SANDERS SIDES!!
Dog: barks  Virgil: gAH DEMON-
God this video gave me anxiety it was amazing but it gave me anxiety.

I loved this episode so much! I really wish I could support the patron.
omgggggg i love this so much! good job thomas and everyone this was so good!
I'M CRYING
I feel personally attacked
The shippers at it's fine :3 I love Virgil's new eyeshadow color
This was so amazing! <3 <3
Wait, if Virgil's eyeshadow changes when he's happy to purple and in distress/anxious to black, does that mean we've never seen Virgil happy until today?
sorry to rain on your black parade GERARD GAY I LOVE IT
Me watching this episode: *Gay screaming*
Do  I Smell     PRINXETY?!
lets all admit it once we see our friends or family upset any anxiety gets thrown out the window and anything and everything is done for them and now i can imagine remus seeing this and throwing virgil out the window and just just watching with disaproving look on his face
Gerard  GAY.,...that is yes
'I dunno..plant..?' Is something i would totally say
i am scREECHING RIGHT NOW AJKHFKKALWIEKSPWNZP
Oh my god this entire episode is just... *(chef's kiss)* I'm just glad to see the Roman is still ok. I was a little nervous after SvS Redux.
OH MY GOD VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW AT THE END AAAAAAHHHH THIS IS MY FAVOURITE EPISODE EVER
Now I have to decide if I should go to bed for 3-4 hours and wake up extremely tired or just stay awake since I'm not tired. It's 3:30am :P
Gerard GAY!!!!!!!!!!!!   Someone plz help, I am DYING!!!!!!!  *distant screams*
SHUT UP EMO 😭💕💖💗💓 OH GOSH THEIR SMILES JUST MADE MY DAY
This was the best thing I have seen all day <3
Virgil: "That's like, cyberstalking... but real life." Roman: "So... stalking." Virgil: "Oh, you're right!" That killed me XD
Silence Virgil : gAh! DeMoN-
welp I have a new favorite episode
..I love how Virgil's eyeshadow changes when he's excited. Especially towards the end, when he's faced with the possibilities and you can see it losing some of its vibrancy, before it changes to black when he gets scared. I honestly love those small details so much
Omg at the end card virgils eyeshadow keeps changing from black to purple!!!!
Virgil's eye shadow changes when he's happy.
I love this- it's so great- bruh I can feel the gay panic from here- also I love how when Virgils happy his eye shadow gets brighter! That's pretty smart to sneak in.
Virgils purple eye shadow I can’t it’s so cute
THE MAKEUP THE MAKEUP THE MAKEUP
All the prinxiety shippers be like: eeeeeeeekk😍 😂😂😂 Cool Video
What a minute Virgil is thinking about Janus's feeling eeeerrrr what
19:57 my ship is SAILING
:3
HOLY COW!!!!! THAT WAS INCREDIBLE :DDDDD
Calling me out when trying to find cute girls
Virgil: "No no I wasn't testing you, I was just panicking"  Yes I missed my emo bean   Edit: Also! I love that it seems when Virgil's really happy his eyeshadow is purple instead of black!!!
This was BEAUTIFUL-
I have never felt a video on such a personal level
Thomas at the beginning: “Love is the key ingredient in the best recipes...after salt.”  Ah so Roman and Virgil are the best ingredients
Omg!!!! Gay eyes😏🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok theory: Purple eyshadow is excitement, and black eyeshadow is anxiety
This makes me want to talk to more strangers or random people I don't know in my classes...
I’m so happy
Prinxiety is comfirmed canon
PRINXIETY STANS COME GET YALLS JUICE

FINALLY A NEW POST
Hooray, who's Gay Me: uhhh, not me Other Sides: Lies
Thomas: nothing but a bruised ego Roman: HM  AJZNSKANZNZ 😂💖💖 I LOVE THIS
The 42 dislikes are Janus on different accounts because of how much lying was in this video lol
THE SEROTONIN THIS GAVE ME
HE FEARS THINGS TOO is me anytime someone admits they were afraid
OK are we just going to ignore the fact that the dude said "are you ok! And thomas went "nothing but a bruised ego" and roman responded to that!!!
omg the roman and virgil duo is making me beyond happy
I felt that gay panic in my soul
AAAAHH!! This is soooooo cute🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
*_the king has uploaded_*
THE ENDING OF THE FREAKKSHWJVING ANIMATIC I AM SCREAMING I LITERALLY PUT MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH SKWHAKHAKA
Im gonna cry my eyeballs out because that was so gosh darn cute and it was just trying to figure out what happened and if that happened in real life that would be so cute and I mean nico seems perfect for you and if I had the money I would join the patreon but I dont and my heart wants to burst at all the cuteness!  Sorry about that. My uh romantic side kinda came out. But seriously. So cute and adorable
Prinxiety aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh
I love Thomas so much TwT
This legit gave me so much secondhand anxiety that I has to step away a few times. Lol.
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW ADORABLE VIRGIL IN PURPLE EYESHADOW IS??
I cried. Stop doing this to me Thomas (btw don't stop doing this, it's the best part of my YEAR) I love you so much, and well done to the artists
Virgils eyeshadow: beautiful  Episode: amazing Animation: love it Patreon: is going to join Hotel: trivago
OMG I love this and I want more Virgil with purple eyeshadow!!!!!!!              Roman and Virgil: LIAR        The other sides: * Holding Janus back *                Janus: IT'S MY TIME TO SHINE!!!! LET ME GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
TS: -heart with an arrow in it- R: ehhhhhh- V: huh- TS: uhhh- V: delete it o-o TS: okay!-
AAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS WAS AMAZING I AM STILL SCREAMING--
GAH DEMON
Shut up emo is my favourite line now
Roman has a list of his mistakes?
This entire episode needs to become a show! And I love Roman and Virgil's reactions they are priceless and this whole thing is a mood!
No one:  Not a soul:  Not even Logan:  Prinxiety fans: dO i SmElL sHiP
*the prinxiety is strong with this one.*
Yassss
Oh my life
I screamed when virgil fan girled and was smiling so much
dfsfregftr this was amazing
This animatic was so cute and overly relatable
oHoHoO this made me have JOY
W oO a h
I WAS ABSOLUTELY SQUEALING WHEN THOMAS STARTED TALKING TO NICO!! AAA THIS WAS SO GOOD!!
THIS IS SO AMAZING HOW DO YOU- is this amount of talent allowed?? (To both the animators and Thomas lol)
I was about to go to sleep!!! But this is worth it!!! It's like midnight here!!
I really wish I wasn't broke
The princeity in this is ✨strong✨
Roman: If he´s ready, we're ready. * Starts zooming into Virgil * Me: Is this the moment of realization? The moment where he finds out how much he loves Roman?  Virgil: GAH! Demon!  Thomas: Dang Dog! Me: WHY.
22:35 did anyone notice that when virgil is happy/excited the eyeshadow under his eyes turns purple,, and it looks kinda shiny too,,,,,
vigils eye shadow tho
I legit thought that this was a fan-made video and then I was like "wait that's new" I go back and relise that it isn't 😂😂
Me and my sister were literally both screeching when I saw this on my recommended. Not like “EEEEEE!” Like...spawn of Satan screeching. I think we need help.          Also Virgils eyeshadow✨✨✨
THE ANIMATION IS THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! I want to give Roman and Virgil the biggest hug
I LOVE THIS THIS IS MY FAVOURITE EPISODE IT SO CUTE AND I RELATE SO MUCH OMG THOMAS YOU GAY GENIUS
I love Virgil's new eyeshadow!!!
7:58 I really, really, REALLY wish people would stop saying “antisocial” when they mean “unsocial” like they forgot what “anti” means! Antisocial people have a personality disorder! Serial killers are antisocial! Introverts are unsocial! Please ... stop saying antisocial!
*still fangirling* Thomas I’m so happy that you found someone! 😁 I wish you two well!!
This was so good!! Omg! :D
This. THIS! The animatic was wonderful! And the pefect happy ending- I'm very happy right now.
OH MY GOOODDD YEESSSS
VIRGIL LOOKING AT THOMAS AND ROMAN, THEN HYPERVENTILATING AND THE PUSH JUST MADE ME 💕💘💓💞💖 AAAAAAAAA
Am I the only one who noticed Virgil's eye shodow changing colours when he is excited???
i get it. hes ROMANtic.
Was this just a skit or do you actually have a boyfriend now Thomas I need to know these things
okay so if roman is okay is janus and patt-
You know. I came prepared for angst..NOT THIS RUSHDHDHSH I AINT COMPLAINING THO
This was the good wholesome content I needed to see...;w;
You worked with Alex! Yay!
Well here’s my serotonin for the day-
This would be amazing as a  live action! Edit: social anxiety sucks and so dose  depression,  Does watching Thomas Sanders videos  make my day suck less   yes, yes thay do!  Virgil : that throws out  the whole point of the pin system , it is so you look at the  pins and then you butternut it. Roman : pin trivets because there introverts and they talk by using pins .  Edit 2: Roman and Virgil stop playing pong with Sanders as the  little weight Square.
"Lil punk-"
ahH WHEN VIRGIL PUSHED HIM AND THE ENDING AND THE PRINXIETY ITS ALL SO BEAUTIFUL AHDBEYFVYFVEFGRV
me during the whole episode: so when are they gonna kiss goddamit (I'm a helpless multi shipper)
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW WHEN HE IS HAPPY AHHHH IT'S SO CUTE I CAN'T AHHHHH IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL WHEN I GET EXCITED IT FEELS SO MUCH LKE ANXIETY THAT SOMETIMES I HAVE PANIC ATTACKS SO VIRGIL BEING LIKE YOU NEED TO MOVE AROUND THOMAS AHHHH I RELATEEEEEE
This is so cute omg
This video was the most adorable in the gods damn universe and I needed this light in my life.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
A new video on my birthday gosh I'm lucky
The animation is so cute!
OMG YES
Is Niko real?
I'm not going to lie, when I first saw this, I started screaming and freaking out in pure excitement for a good 5 minutes! Also not going to lie, I was doing that during most of the video. This episode was AMAZING!!! The fact that Virgil and Roman kept scorning him in the beginning for accidentally doing deceitful things I think is really in character after last episode. Also, I think this is the closest we've ever gotten to the sides (especially Virgil and Roman) not in some way getting into an argument with one  another while trying to help Thomas. Overall, AMAZING and I hope that this signals a turn for the better when it comes to Thomas' life in the story!
PRINXIETY CONFIRMED,THIS IS NOT A DRILL, *PRINXIETY CONFIRMED* IT'S GOTTA BE!!!~
Virgil refuses to let him use the most honest method, walk up say hi and tell him I think you’re cute, then tells Thomas that he’s just being a liar and using Deceit...Virgil what the hell man...
Ok but like the blushing when Virgil looked at Roman, and the hearts next to Roman...❤️ 19:58
Not sure why but I got 6 separate address 'breaks' over the duration of this video.  And most of them were multiple adds at one time. It really interrupted the flow of it all....
AHHHHHHH
The purple makeup when virgil is happy I'm. Anxiety coming off as excitement is a+++
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE HAND FLAPPING I GOT SO EXCITED
Virgil is a Gryffindor confirmed.
Aw man I was expecting Janus to appear somewhere djdjendnd
DOES THOMAS SHIP PRINXIETY?
I was waiting this >//3//<
God the social anxiety hits so close to home and god this is so well done. Thank you so much to everyone who came together to make this, I'm sure this was not easy with everything that's happened this year.
2:11 hihihi.. dodo   Was that Patton shining through here?
It was worth, the wait, i wanna scream so badly, but ny dad is at the other room, omg, thomas and sides, you've made me cry, once again.
I love the happy scream at the end🤣🤣
10:50 : i dunno, pLaNts
I know you probably won't see this, Thomas, but I just want to say, you've made me happier than I've been for a long while, and for that, thank you so, so much❤
How did I miss thisssss!?
Top of the mornin to ya
The end card IS THE HAPPIEST MOST WHOLESOME THING EVER 😁😁😁😁
Virgil blushing was everything!
OMGG THAT WAS SO GOOODDD Thomas thank you for helping out and showing off  artists! We all need and benefit from it!!!
When the cafe man says he was writing a song and there was pretty music in the background Me:Song??
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW VIRGIL REFERED TO ROMAN WITH HIS ACTUAL NAME INSTEAD OF 'PRINCEY' BECAUSE I--
ASDFGHJKLÑ!!! LOVE THIS!!! VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW!!!🖤 🖤 🖤 💜💜💜🖤🖤🖤 My multishipper heart was so happy with the Prinxiety here tbh. Everything is so cool!!!🖤 🖤 🖤 And the animation was  A M A Z I N G!🖤
i'm so happy you made another sander sides video
Anyone else notice that Virgils eyeshadow changes color when hes excited???
Roman actually being Thomas: calls Thomas old
Oh my gosh...my poor heart...just...wow. That was amazing.
Awwww this episode makes me so happy!!
I really liked the animation and how Roman and Virgil were there colors
I related to that end credit scene way to much
Gay baby QvQ love❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍
heh... Virgil has a way of showing emotions now... And he's scared of dogs XD...     Thomas definitely needs to pee
21:22 *a wild laughing snake appears*
This episode make my heart melted in love just such an amazing content and guys you two need try to talk to him with the ❤️ because you know if he have a Latino side he gonna love it
I had seconds hand embarrassment oh my gosh thank the lord the feelings spilled by the end! My sister immediately texted me when you uploaded lol
I am screaming, also WHAT'S GOING ON WITH VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW 💖💖💖💖✨⭐✨⭐✨
That was beautiful :)
What what does it mean when virgils makeup turns purple
Yo Thomas is this your way of telling us that you’re going on a date 😏😏
THIS IS SO CUTE IM GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK
I made the mistake of opening discord after this video was posted, 5 minutes later the bloops are still going
To be honest? The cartoon style is even better than the live action because the actions and expressions can be more exaggurated, and the scenery isn't limited by filming locations or budget. I kinda want more episodes in this cute cartoon style.
I love it when Virgil pushed Thomas to talk to the guy, he felt bad for Thomas and Roman and ahh this was amazing!
The scene when Thomas was talking in the bathroom,And it was so serious I was ready for another side to pop out and do something stupid 😂 the. The Dude came out of the stall that scene was everythinggg
God this is the cutest episode ever!! 😍
Who else wants a sander sides animated show now?
THE ENDING OMG MY HEART
G e r a r d   G a y
Oh my god, I've never been so happy for a content creator I follow and at the same time so sad that I live in a third world country (Venezuela) :c The best of lucks with your Patron!! I'm sure you guys will kill it with it and hopefully someday I'll be able to access it :3
Virgil!!!!!!!!! THAT PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love him!!!!
VIRGIL'S IN LOVE EYESHADOW AT THE END I CAN'T

I just woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. When I checked my phone I got this notification as soon as I woke up.  M y  b o d y  k n e w
I love how at the end Virgil's eyeshadow color changes to purple when he's excited
This gave me too much second hand anxiety, I need a minute
Ok I cant be the only one that noticed virgils eyeshadow turned from black to purple cause he was a happy boi after talking to roman and been like prinxiety confirmed.
When you're too broke to get patreon even tho you're desperate for everything
ROMAN X VIRGIL ROMAN X VIRGIL ROMAN X VIRGIL JUST HAPPENED BEFORE MY VERY EYES Roman: Shut up emo **looks back to Thomas smiling** Virgil: **smiles at Roman then looks to Thomas** ITS FINALLY HAPPINGING PEOPLE!!!! WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
PRINXETYYYYYYY
Virgil's eyeshadow switching back to black from Thomas's bad tweet is honestly peak comedy.
Wait, Its An Animatic?!?!? SIGN ME THE HECK UP
Janus's patron..... Me: AAAAAA WHERES TBEHE FUCKING LINLK!?
the end of the ep with all the stimmy things virgil has thomas do,, so relatable
*I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay* Edit: time stamp is 10:07
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN THE NEXT EPISODE WAS COMING OUT EARLIER AND THEN I SAW IT AND AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
“But what if it’s a mistake?”  “Then I’ll add it to the list!”  And this is when I started crying
This is literally my favourite episode ever omg ♡♡♡ worth the wait !
Nico Flores is the man of my dream
Some parts of this i just feel way too hard -_-

This is the first new sanders sides video I’ve seen since entering the fandom :,) But also-also, can we just thank Thomas for giving us sanders sides content during covid times? <3
VIRGILS EYESHADOW OH MY GOD AHSLFBDN
Omg! I looked so forward to this and I love it! I am soooo happy and will rewatch this episode 15 times Minimum. Like I did witch every episode xD  Just know how much happiness you've brought to me in the last months (I discovered the channel in may). Best wishes to you, joan, talyn and everyone else. I love this community and am excited for the future💙💚💛❤💜
Thomas: The next Sanders Asides isn’t going to be that long The next Sanders Asides: *longer than the last one*  The end card was full of gay panicking.
(clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap...)
Did anyone else notice when virgil was happy the eyeshadow was purple?!?!! That's so great, I love how much thomas puts into this and I'm so excited for more!!!!
part of me felt personnally attacked by the video but other part felt everything so cute so the offended part don't mind amazing work
Ok happy Virgil with purple eyeshadow is actually goals
Are we not going to talk about Virgil’s changing Eyeshadow when it kept switching from PURPLE to BLAK!!!!
I have never felt so seen but also attacked in my life thank you Thomas 😂
Aw. Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when hes not super nervous. That's so sweeeettttttt.   Also, Ahhhhhh. This whole thing reminds me of last year when I sat next to a really cute girl in my science class. I didn't know how to talk to her, so the entire year I just silently tried to figure out if she was bi or pan or something. I never talked to her the entire time I was next to her... And then at the end of it she came up to me with these little pride stickers. She handed me a nonbinary one that said you're enby-lievable and told me that she had been wanting to ask me out but didn't know how. I panicked and blurted out that she smelled really nice and now we're really good friends. I still like her, but I'm not ready for a relationship again.
I genuinely thought that this video was gonna be Roman flirting with Virgil
This is getting more and more relatable the further I go into the video
But imagine how weird Thomas looks because he's only one that can hear and see the sides, in public he looks like he's talking to himself 🤣❤💜
I love virgil's new eye new eye shadow 😀 (sorry if i spelled his name wrong)
REMEMBER GUYS ITS NOW CANNON THAT WHEN VIRGIL IS EXCIDED HIS EYE SHADOW GLOWS! (Ive watched tis video 3 times already)
The prinxiety shippers are quaking rn.......I'm quaking rn
AAAAAAAWWWWWW PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS REAL AHHH
Omfg
Virgil with purple eye shadow is beautiful-
yall were just annoying us prinxiety shippers werentt ya? AND VIRGILS PURPLE EYE SHADOW UGH I DIED
This is adorable and pretty much when ever a fellow gay falls in love with another gay they just met and haven't even talked to- also- gay eyes-
Anyone else notice that Virgils eye shadow was changing colors from black to purple
THE. PURPLE. EYESHADOW.
Am I the only one who realized that Virgil's makeup is a little different in the live action parts-?
I needed this.
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤩🤩🤩🤩
I felt gay panic the whole time
WHEN VIRGIL'S HAPPY HIS EYE SHADOW IS PURPLE AND WHEN HE'S ANXIOUS HIS EYE SHADOW IS BLACK OH MY GOSH I FREAKING CAN'TTTTTTT
10:45 Roman: "what are you doing? -.- " Thomas: "I don't know ... plaaants?" this entire thing is way too relatable xD
I am probably being stupid but when is the moment people are talking about when Virge amplifies his voice because of the dog?? I can't find it Edit: found it on my own literally seconds after posting. im big dum  24:04
No one gonna mention how Virgil has purple eyeshadow instead of black I love it btw😀
AWWW VIRGILS EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES FEELING POSITIVE/HAPPY
Me: aaaaaah another video, and is it just me or am I the only one that got distracted by the Cinderella castle while Thomas's frame was up
Why is nobody mentioning that Tomas was kicked around more than a football this episode?
YASS FINALY!!!
.......   Thomas has been reading the fanficts?!
When I saw this I clicked at the speed of gay
My birthday was on the 8th so this feels like a belated birthday present.💖😊💖
I LOVED the animation and the video ❤. That last part. XD
I literally started wheezing when a new journey of a new ship began not to mention that prinxiety moment tho- but honestly the animation, plot and literally this video was a masterpiece! ÚwÙ I actually had a ton of fun watching this more than I expected :>
I CLICKED SO FAST
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
this video just made my day
This is SO GREATLY AMAZGAY AND BEATUIFU! Absolutly one of the favorite episodes thus far in the entire series. The art was incredible and made the moments so emotional and great, the voice acting was awesome and added so much, the story was hilariously heart touching and it made my weekend.  It’s been a rough couple of weeks and this has made its so much better, thank you so much for all you do Thomas and Co. you all make such amazing stuff that makes so many happy :D
Anyone elses anxiety went haywire over the events that you over this and just immediately felt better at the end and VIRGILS EYES SHADOW!? I CANT IM JUST SNNDDJ YOU AND THE SIDES LOOKED SO HAPPY! I love it! I'm gonna go look into patreon now-
19:52-12:00 Prinexity moment?? (fr tho I actually started crying I ship them so much)
I can absolutely relate to the anxiety of talking to a stranger. Heck, I sometimes get anxious when I want to talk to people I know but they are busy talking to other people. You could be sitting in a room with someone having anxiety but you may never realize it because it's all happening in the person's head. Now that doesn't mean it's not real, it's just not as easily noticeable.  Also, I absolutely love purple eyeshadow on Virgil!!!!!! It's even like a metallic sparkly purple which I love!!!!!!!! Virgil is still my favorite side and I love him even more now!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wasn’t gonna watch this video until much later today but I woke up feeling really shitty this morning so I decided to watch it now and it helped me feel a lot better (I even laughed during the video which wasn’t the best idea because my stomach hurt but I’ll be fine). Thanks Thomas :)
“Oh shut up emo.” “You tickle me emo!” Thomas?-
I'm so proud and this video broke my  feels
OMG I AM IN HEAVEN BECAUSE IT WAS A SLIGHT PRINXIETY MOMENT, A VIDEO THAT HAS A LOT OF VIRGIL SO I CAN COPE WITH MY ANXIETY, AND A JANUS PATREON
damn am i glad i'm aromantic if this is what y'all allos deal with
Oh my gosh Virgils eye shadow at the end tho!!!!!! (Also, i love how it keeps going back and forth)
This should just be called Gay Panic: In depth
YASSSSS
i will talk to anyone  you need help i will help and jump in     I will also want to know this person you meet
Every comment: am I the ONLY ONE who saw Virgil's eyeshadow?!
was not ready for one of these today but i’m totally excited  edit: this was the cutest 🥺🥺🥺 and u basically gave princxiety shipper so much new material and i’m tots a lil jealous
Did I just hear Thomas make a Brooklyn 99 reference or...
The prinxiety is amazing, love it. The patreon is amazing, love it. The end card, lovvvveeee it
Hold up hold up since when did Roman and Virgil get along??? Becouse it's so adorable! I litelary cried of happines becouse it was so adorable the gay panick that Thomas had ✨ adorable ✨ whole Virgil's look ✨ adorable ✨ Roman trying to get Thomas a boyfriend ✨ adorable ✨ it just made me cry of happines bro I can't this whole video is adorable
-a little sampler... siide? That was terrible.  Me: Patton? Is that you?
Virgil going out of his comfort zone to make Roman happy 😭😭😭
Im curious what Virgil's eyeshadow switching between black and purple means.
Virgil screaming/squealing/fanboying is WHAT I NEED IN THIS LIFE
This is amazing I love how creative this is
HIS EYE SHADOW DID TURN PURPLE AHHHHHHH THATS SO CUTE
I'm sorry but I believe Virgil meant to say he is an expert on "asocial etiquette" not "antisocial etiquette." Antisocial personality disorder is kind of a different thing than not enjoying being social. I'm really sorry to be that guy but I just felt like I should say that.
THE ROMAN ANGST!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My Roman stan heart is exploding rn 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
That was so adorable I smiled through the whole thing and that doesn't happen often
Well, Janus is having a field day today.
the moment we have all been waiting for an animatic
thank you for posting ive been waiting so long thank youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW GOES TO GLITTERY PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY, THAT'S SO CUTE 🥺🥺🥺 ROMAN, ARE YOU OKAY?!, AND OML AHHHHH IM S O HAPPY
12:19- 12:37 i turned int a sound on tik tok
Mr flooress: call me nico My anime brain: neko neko neeee
10:13 - 10:something kinda reminds me of in a heatbeat.  Roman-Heart Virgil-the guy who owns the heart Thomas' s crush- the guy with black hair or brown I dont know who thomas is
Whelp, Prinxiety is official now. Ya happy, fandom?
Wait is the live action version paterion only?
Omg I love how they included that extra energy in the ending bit. Shaking your hands, pacing, jumping around a bit, I know it’s not the oddest thing for people to do, but I always feel self-conscious when I do things like that around people. So I just really liked seeing that in these videos.
COMMUNIGAYTION
I was so excited when I saw that it was posted that I forgot how to spell Thomas’s name and I threw my phone no joke almost broke it
Glad I got be around for an actual episode release (I was 3 weeks late for the SvS redux), and this. Was. SO FREAKING WORTH THE WAIT! IM SO HAPPY THAT YOU HAD AD WORK ON THIS!
When I say that I needed this in my life I meaN I REALLY NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE So many amazing lines and I just LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT aLSO VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY🥺🥺🥺
y'all's writing is so good!!! when I get a job I might donate to the patreon! I really appreciate you making this content! I've been in a really tough spot and Sanders sides really helps me out
That eye shadow change!!!! 🤩
Anyone else's screech reach glass shattering pitches when Roman touched Virgils shoulder? No? Just me? Ok, well, I've got some glass to clean up.  Also, can we talk about Virgils eye shadow at the end? Purple then black, then purple then black again?!
I'm this close to scream of joy and I don't know why I'm close to cry too, my heart is full of joy this video is so beautiful I love it, you all did an amazing job and I love Virgil and Roman screentime and action, I liked a lot the draw even if simple it was really beautiful, I will never stop to say how much I love this.
This was great, but where is Logan? We cant have a vid without my nerdy boi!!!
Omg it’s just like the song gay or European and the sides are the group of judges and it’s perfect cause is name is nico and I don’t what I’m saying but this song is so perfect for this episode because they can’t figure out if he is gay or not. 🤯  It probably dose make sense though  😅
* Towards the end I was like “When’s JJ(Janus) coming????” *
This was adorable!!
Virgils eyeshadow changed from purple to black when his feelings changed....I think Roman's getting virgil to loosen up before tell him what happened last episode. Idk I'm probably wrong
Virgil's new eye-shadow oh my goodness! It's bootiful!
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is majestic!!
“Uhh plant” - Thomas Sanders 2020
"And I also don't want me to be doing what I'm doing!"
19:51  this honestly made me cry.  Prinxiety shippers are joining-
Awww Virgil have on purple eyeshadow
I’ve been waiting for this
OMG! IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE HE POSTED. EEE
Seeing Virgil so excited for something makes me feel all warm and fuzzy
I just gotta say thank you, Thomas. Someone who went to my school died yesterday morning in a car crash.  I didn't know him, but according to just about everyone in my life, I'm very empathetic, so it was hard with my friend, who knew him from a class she was in, and my teacher, who knew him from some club she hosted, were both in bad shape.. I'm not gonna lie. This happy story made my week a bit better, So thank you..  But uh, side note- *please don't worry about me???* I just get numb and become more in tune with people's emotions and anxiety n stuff because of it- and uh.. I normally get numb around death-- But yeah, thank you.. <3
I can just say this video is a mood.
Anyone notice the purple eye shadow?
The end was getting cute, Virgil replaced his dark eyeshadow with bright purple and he was ecstatic... and then anxiety spike happened. Looking forward to next video tho ❤💙💜🔵(I know it's not heart but we don't have dark blue heart and our real heart isn't even shaped like that, use your logical side people, lol)
This is so chaotic.  I love it.
Yo- you didnt have to call me out like that,, earings and t-shirts are a good way like the pind but heres a thing on the pin,,,, BUT ALSO, heres my dilema about the pins,, if someone puts pins and stickers down then theyer putting their intereats on display wich is inviting a conversation,,, BUT ALSO it could be that they just put the pins and stickers on for their enjoyment and something for them, BUT they could-   Ok u see what im doing here this is- this is the problem i gotta not✨
"I hate to rain on your black parade Gerard gay" CAN I GET THAT ON A TSHIRT
PRINXIETY STANS ARISE
Virgil called Janus Deceit HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPEND
This was so fricking beautiful
Prinxiety 🏳️‍🌈👀
Anxiety’s happy eyeshadow is so beautiful!
*The gay panic in this is immeasurable
THIS MADE ME FEEL THINGS AND I LOVE IT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
That gave me so much serotonin
I didnt know I was gonna cry today 😭😂
VIRG IS SLOWLY TURNING INTO BRAVERY WICH IS AWWWSSOOOOMMMMMMME
God I wish I had money to join the patreon 😔
Question:  Do both Ro and Virgy like Coraline-?
I love how Virgil's eyeshadow changes! Also Virgil and Roman are so cute when they work together! I love this episode!
I have always wondered what is the reason for janus having the snake bit on his face
So my life😳
Virgil’s eyeshadow got me, it looks amazing when it switched.
PRINXIETY CONFIRMED
Im finally able to afford the Patron OGDJCXFFCADTJMASI
My Other Side is Showing ''gasp''
The idea of having pins and buttons to show that you’re part of lgbtq+ and so you have a way of talking without talking is genius.   ..... alright time to make so pins and buttons.
I love how Virgil's eyeshadow changes depending on his mood
happy virgil is all ive ever needed in life. thats it. the happy virgil at the end? all i've ever *ever* needed
Prinxiety fans come get y'all juice
WHAT A FREAKING AMAZING VIDEO!!!! ABD ILLUSTRATES I SEE U ❤❤❤
The prinxiety fans are gonna be like toddlers on sugar rush,
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE'S EXITED MY HANDS ARE SHAKING
Oh my lord I love this
I’m gonna cry this is so precious 🥺🥺
OMG finally! I missed this so much Oh and Roman is so me. Sad that he cant seem to change  Thomas's actions.😕
AHAHAHAH MY PRINXIETY HEART IS SCREAMING CURRENTLY I NEED A MINUTE-
VIRGIL IN FLASHY MAKEUP- I CANT
This is ADORABLE ❤💜❤💜
Also might be me just speculating but does Virgil's eyeshadow change with his emotions? Like when he's his usual self it's black, but when excitedly happy/emotional it goes purple? If not, still love it! If it is intentional, nice touch!!
Don't mind me constantly replaying probably the most wholesome scene I've ever seen 22:23   Virgil's eyeshadow changing because he's so ecstatic makes me so HAPPPPPYYYYYY SEEING MY BABY HAPPY FILLS ME WITH SO MUCH SEROTININ AND JOY
Okay but VIRGIL SMILING
Reaction Video is recorded...  Addition after numerous of rewatches: Is Virgil using this Voice™ again at the end? I mean not his last line but after the dog thing.
HAPPY VIRGIL HAPPY VIRGIL HAPPY VIRGIL SO MUCH FECKIN SEROTONINNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!
gelkjghiueskgrthiusrhgwe A new video I'm so excited omg .
"I'm gonna need to to walk around the entire space of the rue in like a frenzy. That helps somehow." just!!! so true!!!
Vigils eyeshadow switching from purple to black based on how he feels was pretty cool
How do I get virgils jacket
Honestly the most relatable thing in this video is Virgil wanting Thomas to do happy sims, it makes me less self conscious about my happy stims. Ug, its so wholesome!
virgil stims !!! that gives me !!! serotonin !!!
"You're making a mistake!" "If I am, I'll add it to the list!" Me-
Watching this had me screeching and yelling at the screen so many times, I love it so much. This whole thing was cute!! AND THEN VIRGIL AT THE END!! He was so happy!! And Roman-!! Don't get me started
Youre in your 30s??????
I saw this on Facebook
I’m so sad why won’t patreon take venmoooooooo
gods this is so relatable on SO many levels. I was falling out of my chair laughing throughout this video
IM SO HAPPY RN!
With the purple eyeshadow,Virgil looks like a magical girl.  he's the magic girl of anxiety—
Prinxiety shippers are freaking out
Never have I felt more called out but ty for showing that even if you have anxiety flirting with other people, it can still work out if you push yourself and have a little courage ❤️
Huh, who knew Virgil is a hopeless romantic
I think we all need to talk about how BRAVE Virgil is? While this episode is an outright example of when he pushed Thomas to go after Niko, I will throw in the theory about him leaving the "Dark" Sides. He's anxiety, he's the one who resents change the most and is the most in need of constants for Thomas in order to feel at ease. But if he left the Dark Sides, the only people he had some form for a relationship with to go off with Roman, Patton, and Logan because he realized that being in that environment wasn't conducive for Thomas' life, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SCARY THAT MUST'VE BEEN? Leaping in to a new environment with new people he didn't really know without knowing if they would even accept his presence, let alone even want to be friends with him. But look where he is now?  Yeah, still anxious and unsure of course, but he does seem happier. He seems more comfortable, all things considered. Of course this is all just speculation until we get more lore bits, but Virgil is so freaking brave, and it's so nice to see him and other people realize that. Also that EYESHADOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL ON HIM HE IS SO PERFECT!! I love that it's sparklyyy.
Omg this episode is such a mood, and HOLD UP VIRGIL GOT PURPLE EYE SHADOW?!?
Virgil's eye shadow changed back to black when Thomas had tweeted something that made him a bit more anxious, but beforehand, it was purple. I wonder if his eye shadow changes with the level of euphoria he feels-
Thomas: *Talking about Patreon and it’s perks* Me: crying cause I am a poor soul and can’t afford it, but I want to write out sander sides scripts too 😭, imagine the chaos I would totally make the first time of Remus and Janus on camera memorable. Something like  Janus: *appears* Remus: hey double dee Janus: *hisses in return, or says a snarky comment*
OMG VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW    IM BFJDUWKSBFWO
The Prinxiety shippers are losing their minds rn.
i’m obsessed with virgil’s changing eyeshadow in the last live action bit, it basically proves the theory that it’s controlled by his emotions. also “you’re making a mistake” “iLL ADD TO THE LIST” hit HOME roman are you ok
So are Roman and Virgil going to be an official thing? Can I just say VIRGIL IS HAPPY!  I am so freaking excited for the next episode!
Nope who else saw that clearly ship with Roman and Virgil?
Thank you so much for working so hard to gift us with this video!
VIRGIL’S BRIGHT PURPLE MAKEUP WHEN HE WAS EXCITED AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
is this thomas’s way of introducing a boyfriend?? no im the only one who thought that okay
Virgils makeup changing colour :0 uhhhhh
Serotonin levels went📈📈📈
This was amazing!  If you do this again here are some people who can help you:  A. Simon Tofield B. Rooster Teeth Animation C. Glitch Productions D. Cranbersher
Virgil aren't you the one who's making him lie?? Why are you berating him lol
"i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard Gay" I *YELLED*
Yesssssss
I loved this far too much
Sobbing 😭
Is it just me but did Virgils eye bags/Eye Shadow change colors.At first it was bright purple the changes to black then back to bright purple 👀
I laughed, I cried,  this heartfelt small adventure was the highlight of my week. thank you Thomas!
This was so cute and funny 😆 💖💞
I CRIED THE ENDD IM NOT GIVING SPOILERS BUT ASICJFN$VNDJEICC
not me crying at the end of the video
True definition of *Gay panic intensifies*
Wait... So after the outro, when Virgil, Roman, and Thomas were all really excited and talking Virgil's eyeshadow kept going from purple when he was like really excited to black when he was either less excited or anxious / nervous. That's The first time I've ever seen his eyeshadow change
Is it true that there is going to be a new side
Thomas: I saw you...and I just knew.... Me: 🥺 Random guy: bursts out of stall all teary Me: *HHHHHHJJJJHJHJHJHJB*
this was like super cute and made me feel like taking more changes.....idk..... hehehe you videos always put me in a deep thought😅
Me: I is ded! I cannot believe this is real! Virgil do you know Jan's name! Or do you hate him that much to not say his name?
happy virgil has different eyeshadow its so pretty!!!!!
the guy in the cubical must have been so quiet while being on the loo to not hear anything
Virgils Eyeshadow! What? I can not! I don't even know how to even! Holy flip, I lOVE IT! THe way it changes and the purple with the highlight? Relatable, whish I could have that in real life. AND YES! FInally something good for Character Thomas! HE DESERVES EVERYTHING AND HONEY YOU ARE READY!
10:08  Haha black parade haha mcr haha
Virgils happy makeup!!!
Oof, that second hand anxiety and embarrassment. Lovely video, even if I needed a few pauses to calm down. I'm always thrilled to see more Virgil and I really liked this new step for Thomas!
O my gods this was adora-ble!!!!
I need to see this live action just to see this scream 16:08 from Virgil.
Roman: *starts talking romantic princy like* Thomas: What? Roman: Cutie at 12 'o clock.  XD I can't with you, Roman-
Theory - Virgil is becoming a light side his new eye shadow is switching between black and purple maybe it’s a mix or it could be him trying to become a light side Theory 2 - Virgil caring for Janus/deciet since when and why he hasn’t really Ever cared for Janus on screen why my theory is Virgil pretends to dislike him because he believes that he would still be considered a dark side if he did (I’m really looking into this to much)
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I think Viril has been waiting all day to say “Don’t tell me to relax!”
At the beginning of the video I heard Thomas laugh.. that was the first time in months I heard his laugh and didn’t realize how much I’ve missed it... I literally started crying and cried throughout the whole video because I remembered how much I’ve missed sanders sides and I was just so happy to finally see there was a new video.
SHUT UP EMO
HOLY SMOKES VIRGILS EYE BAGS BECOME PURPLE AND SHINY WHEN HE'S HAPPY! AND AND AHHHHHHHH I CRYED, I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS EPISODE TO COME OUT TODAY THIS SERIES MAKES ME SO HAPPY ANDD AHHHHHHH
Is no one talking about how Virgil's eyeshadow changes based off of his emotions at 22:33 like when he is happy its a light purple and when he's back to being anxiety it's black/gray.
IT'S 12.20AM HERE BUT I SEE A NEW THOMAS SANDERS VIDEO I CLICK
I like the purple eyeshadow on virgil
Vee's eye shadow!! !Oh I can't wait to see the cosplays that come from that and it's SO PRETTYEEEEE!!!!  How on earth did I never think that it might change when he was happy! It seems so obvious. Ahhhh I LOVE IT!!!!  Amazing episode!! <3
I love EVERYTHING about this. The new patreon, the amazing artwork featured in the video, the storyline that was built, the amazing jokes and such in the dialogue... Ugh, so good! Then the pure validation I felt from this. I'm a walking bi disaster with ADHD. This whole video spoke to me on a whole new plane of existance.  Also the happy flappy hands! <3 I know a lot of other people do it too but I always feel embarrassed when I stim. Just seeing Thomas doing the happy flap makes me want to join with my own glee.  This video is amazing and will definitely be marked as another favorite of mine.
PRINCEXIETY
"Shut up emo" I know it's been said before...but I don't think it was ever said as sweetly as this. I'm totally loving Roman/Virgil right now, they're adorable in this.
MY PRINXIETY HEART!!!!!!!
Lol Sanders asides
“Feeling like a trash bin” *Laughs in Remus kin*
Anyone else see Virgil’s makeup change? When he was happy it was all purple and shiny 😊 I also have a small theory that the new side (if there is one) might be something along the lines of doubt or regret because when Thomas said “Are we ready for this?”, Virgil went very quiet and when the dog barked he shouted “DEMON!” in his demonic voice showing that he was scared that it was something else, possibly a dark side.
the only thing i can say is: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
49 MINUTES AGO HECK YEAH
OMGOMGOMG ROMANCE YESSSSSS-  ALSO VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW!!
So when we gonna get Sanders B-Sides?? lmaoo
15:46 Virgil: is that fair for him Me:....wait a damn minute   So technically Virgil still dosnt know his name is Janus?
This was totally worth the wait!!! Also Virgil's eyeshadow changing to purple is so pretty!!
OMG ABD ILLUSTRATES!!! I love both of your  channels so much 💖💖💖💖💖
I love the art and this episode
how come no one is talking about virgil's EYESHADOW. IT CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S  EXCITED!!
I am. Screaming.  I am so happy.  I have been fed a most wonderful meal. uwu
I'm not through yet but "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay" is beautiful.
Honestly, this is kind of how my boyfriend and I met. We were at a school event, separately, and both of our friends happened to ditch us.  He was standing near one of the tables in our college's Center Green, and I noticed that he has the same Pride lanyard that I had. I did almost the exact same thing as Thomas, kinda wandering my way over with anxiety fighting me, then I saw him starting to leave and my impulse just kind of took control and I walked over to him and said, not so eloquently, "HI! So, I, uh, noticed, erm, that you, uh, have the same lanyard as I do..." He looked down at his pocket and the Pride lanyard hanging out and saw the same from my pocket. He smiled and said, "Hey, yeah! Are you LGBT?"  My brain went "OH MY GOD" and answered "YeAh." He laughed slightly and smiled again before saying, "Hey, it looks like we're both headed back to the dorms, want to walk together?" So we started walking back and he glanced to the side. "I'm John, by the way." I smiled back and said, "I'm Dean. Nice to meet you." In the span of the five-minute walk from the Greens to our dorms, we found that we had so much in common, and in the main area of our dorms before we went our separate ways he asks me, "Hey, so, do you want to maybe get lunch together tomorrow?" I immediately said yes, and he held out his hand for a handshake. "Cool, I'll see you then. Goodnight, and... I'm really glad to have met you." When I got back to my room I had pretty much the same reaction as Thomas did when he got back.  Because I took that chance, John and I have been together for almost a full year now.
I love this video so so SO MUCH and the fact that VIRGIL ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT DECEIT- AND VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW---- AMAZING--
OMG this is the wholesome dose of ✨ SEROTONIN✨ I needed today! And that ending?!! Phenomenal!!! So happy to see your content again!
"I don't want me to be doing this either" Is that a john mulany reference thomas?

so basically whenever virgil is happy or excited his eyeshadow turns into purple so CUTE
"I love you"  Remus: I love me too
Okay, imma take a moment away from all  the joy. There were a lot in this episode that I think will play a part in the next. As thomas said at the start, this episode is essential to the story. (Also, I'm not gonna have time stamps sorry)  Anyways, im gonna manly focus 9n Virgil. At the end of the episode you can see him questioning whether or not thomas is ready for a relationship. I think this may lead up to the next episode. It could be a call back to moving on, where thomas was letting go of the partner.(also there seemed to be music blocking out everything, and his eyeshadow turned to black, meaning he was upset and lost in thought)  Anyways, next is Roman. There were numerous times in this episode. One being Virgil(I think) saying something about Roman screwing up. And Roman said I'll add it to the list. That cannot be good. And another time was when thomas said he had a bruised ego. It cut back to roman and he looked sad. But also, I feel like having a partner can help Roman in some way. Like he has someone to give him determination and someone to protect.  Anyways, this is just from watching it once, so I'm sure the more I watch this the more things and gestures I'll notice
okay but the purple eyeshadow for virgil at the end???? i’m loving the new look
That whole scene with Thomas’s speech in the bathroom- Prinxiety is wildin
_Are you teasing us with Prinxiety?_
OMG CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT VIRGILS EYESHADOW PLEASE?
Damn you guys really be punching us heavy with the hurt/comfort and angst
Thomas / Janus/ has patrion Me, a broke thomas fan who's fav character is Janus: I. NEED. IT!
Oh god
Best suprise to wake up to ❤️❤️❤️
Virgil is bravery but eeeeeeeeeeeeh my heart and my head. Also love Virgil and Roman(is that how you spell it I didn’t know and my anxious self wanted to get it right) anyway love you and your content
25 minutes of gay panic 😂😂😂 i feel that
Eye shadow was  switching between purple and black!?
Was that thing with Virgil in the end alluding to the orange side? the music seemed a bit different  either way the video was great! <3
It's So Cute I can't Handle this-
I WANNA PLEDGE BUT IM A MINOR AND GOT NO MONEY BUT JUST KNOW I WOULD (also this was a great video and made me smile a scary amount because gay)
Did you notice that when Virgil got more anxious about something in the end credit his eyeshadow was black. And then when he was excited it was purple
how come virge's eyeshadow kept changing at the end?
VIRGILS PURPLE EYE SHADOW OMGGGGG
Thomas: "Gay Eyes?" Roman: "Gay Eyes" Virgil: "What are gay eyes?" Me an intellectual: "Gay eyes~"
oh my goodness The EyE SHADOW!
I JUST WOKE UP OMG!!!
HDHFHFH I THINK ALL THE PRINXIETY SHIPPERS WERE FREAKING OUT TODAY OMG OMG THE SHUT UP EMO PART 🥺🥺🥺
I love you so much
Aaaaahhhhhh I love this 💖🧡💛💚💙💜
Ahhh this episode was amazing, props to everyone involved!
I'm so happy i've been waiting😄😄
HE APPROACHED OMG
Virgil's high voice at 16:08 and 16:11 gives me life  PS VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW
*OK but can we talk about how Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he's happy/blushing?!?!?!?!?!!*
THIS WAS TOO CUTE! Great video Thomas and the gang!
the prinxiety vibes is just😩👌❤💜
I really needed this 😊
let’s talk about virgil’s purple eyeshadow when he gets happy, thanks
With so much of them screaming liar, where is Janus?- The patreon being run by Janus though,he knows we love the slimey snake boy.
I literally had to stop the video when the man came out of the stall. I was going to cry then this man comes out and I start busting a guy, kill me!! 🤣🤣
1. The artists did a PHENOMENAL job 2. Virgil’s makeup at the end!!!!!
PRICEIETY IS HAPPENING
This makes me ship virgil and roman more tbh XD XD XD
did anyone notice when virgil said deceit instead of janus?? I DONT THINK HE KNOWS OMG
I have a theory I think the eyeshadow changes color for extreme positive emotions because he’s been happy before and passed Episodes but not as static as he was in this episode at the end card
OMG. But like, Virgil's eyeshadow at the end. 😙👌
RAIN ON THE BLACK PARADE I'M ADHFKDLASJAGAGDJSKJ
Virgil-the carrots Thomas- ugh
Why on earth is nobody mentioning "I unno... Plant.."
so there's hope for me as long as I keep my pride pins on display? and... go out in public, okay this is already harder than I thought
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH     YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS    LOVE IS LOVE     GET EM BOIIIII
Okay, okay, okay, this was totally worth the wait and ahhHh literally couldnt stop fidgeting the entire time that was so gooodddddddd!!!
this was so gay and so sweet and just so amazing, my heart :'''''''))))
VIRGIL's PURPLE MAKE UP OH MY GOD MY BOY!!!!!
Okay but like in the last bit when Virgil yelled "Don't tell me to relax" he sounded genuinely angry at Roman, I kept on replaying it to and each and every time he sounded some what angry? I'm guessing it means that he was stressed when Thomas said "But are we ready for this?" I'm not completely sure why he sounded angry but theorists do your thing and give us a theory-
This was actually one of the cutest things I’ve seen on so many levels. All the talent. All the heart.
Is Prince x Virgil canon now?
Exited virge has purple eyeshadow but when he’s anxious it’s black THATS SO DANG CUTE
PrinsAnxiety fans: REEEEEEEEEEEE
WHEN VIRGE IS HAPPY THE BAGS ARE PURP WHEN VIRGE IS HAPPY THE BAGS ARE PURP- A N D  THE  H AP P Y   S T I M This really was what I needed in the morning :)))))
VIRGLS UNDER EYE EYESHADOW CHANGING FROM PURPLE TO BLACK DEPENDING ON HOW HE WAS FEELING WAS JUST  AAAA GOODS
Virgils flitting eyeshadow from purple and black is amazing
*Insert Crying Over the amount of cute in this episode*
virgils new eyeshadow theme gives me LIFE💜✨💜✨ 💜the way it changes with his mood is fantastic!!
When Virgil is happy his eyeshadow turns purple.....AHHHHHHH!
Wow. That was amazing.  Also: when Virgil got happy his eye shadow changed. Yaaaaas!
the last part between Roman and Virgil made me tear up a little, love the sander sides videos, i missed them, im glad to see anew one, keep being awesome Thomas and Friends  😁❤
thomas really said prinxiety rights
I feel like prinxiety shipers went crazy at 17:12
Waittt... *DID ANYONE NOTICE HOW VIRGIL’S EYE BAGS SWITCHED FROM SHINEY SEMI-LIGHT PURPLE THEN BACK TO HIS USUAL BLACK!!!!* 😳 😲🥺
"Gerard Gay"
And Virgil and Roman need to let go of the grudge against Janus
VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW OMG!!! I have theory! In the end the eyeshadows purple when he’s happy but black when he’s anxious. So does the eyeshadow match Virgil’s emotions now?!? Omg I loved this episode! 💜💜💜💜💜
Stg my name is niko, and I had a MOMENT right here
Virgil lore Virgil lore Virgil lore Virgil lore Virg
.... Now I ship character Thomas with Bathroom lad.... Oh no
I'm dying!! Thomas why were you worried this is beautiful! It perfectly resembled social anxiety, virgil had sparkly purple eyeshadow, and the lines where virgil says "Thomas you have to go pee" and "go do something with your hands shake them or something" those made me laugh so hard and Eeeeeehhhh I cried and laughed and I love it!!
Prinxiety? Panicking? Me?      YES
MY HEART IS SCREAMING! AKSGSHQKSGA THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOD!
Virgil's purple eyeshadow💜
Poor guy must've been so confused
Vigils eye shadow kept changing colour at the end 0-0
congratulations to the artists! the animation looks so smooth and the character designs are adorable :)
*Second Hand Embarrassment: The Video*
17:05 19:38 Straight (gay) out of a fanfiction, but honestly these scenes were just adorable-
The king is back!
Prinxiety Prinxiety Prinxiety????
so... does this mean Virgil is a gryffindor did we finally solve the mystery of Virgil's hogwarts house-
alright about virgil's eyeshadow so i've noticed that he becomes happy when they go purple he tells thomas to walk around the room and shake his hands. this is what i do when im excited. but when his eye shadow goes black he goes back to the virgil we know. there's this one thing my therapist told me that when i feel anxious, i should try convincing myself that im actually excited because anxiete and excitement have the same effects on your body. so what if virgil is switching to excitement
This is so damn cute Also gay eyes, pins, stickers my inner pansexual is going off Same with my axitity
tbh i feel like the animated version was better... it just gives the characters more life and for once they werent just sitting in their own corner
♡
Roman: I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE, GERRARD GAY I wheezed and promptly started laughing and crying and making windows 10 noises
damn this ep really said Prinxiety rights ❤💜
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK VIRGE WITH CHANGING EYE SHADOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw flirting with social anxiety and thought it was roman x social anxiety. Now im sad.  Also that sides have monthly allowances🤣  ( sorry I didn't know how to spell anxiety's name and I still don't so again sorry )
When you can actually kinda relate to this video because you talk to yourself and feels like a part of you is trying to help you but you don’t know what to do in the process and your just there sitting awkwardly and then you regret everything you’ve done even though it doesn’t matter.
YAY HE’S BACK!
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW CHANGE TO BLACKKKKK IM LOVING THISSSS
This whole video gave me so much anxiety.

the second hand EMBARRASSMENT
I WAS WAITING FOR A VID LIKE THIS-
FOR PERSONAL REASONS, 22:50
“Join me in not thinking” #RomanTheHimbo
Roman: *looks at Virgil than away with hearts* Me: I SAW THAT! YOU CAN NOT LIE TO ME!  Can we just take a moment to see that Virgil not only acted brave BUT asked Thomas if it was fair for him to rely on Janus for everything! Like that clearly shows he still cares for him on some level and it adorable
virgil asking thomas to stim is such a mood  also "don't rain on my black parade gerard gay" ROMAN YOU'RE KILLING ME
YYAAAAAAAAAAASSSS FINALLY! WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Pin-troverts. . .cause they talk- using pins" - Roman P. Sanders 2020
Anyone else noticed Virgils eyeshadows changing colors from purple to black and back? Creepy, really cool and I love it.
Shout out to my alarm clock for letting me get up at, what for me, is 2:30am to watch this immediately
"Top of the morning to ya!" A man of culture I see
Virgil's eyeshadow eyebags!!!!!!!! the purple!!!!
FINNALLY YOUR BACK ;U;
Can we please appreciate and talk about how Virgil kept making Thomas move and fidget because that was a whole mood
Dont mind me imma just 22:20
OH MY GOD WHEN VIRGILS HAPPY HE HAS PURPLE GLITTERY EYE SHADOW I LOVE IT
Virgil: youre making a mistake Roman: If i am ill add it to the list  ROMAN HONEY T A L K T O U S-
i nEVER WANTED TO HAD A PATREON THIS BAD BEFORE-
AHHH MY HEART also the TITLE and Virgil's EYE SHADOW i love this so much YES
as a flaming homosexual I have never related to something more than examining pins to determine sexuality
roman and virgil, let’s get it
What i want to know has this happened before to Thomas
,, is that fair to him?"  ,,No. No, he's better off without me."  Yeah, that's how you do it, you don't even know them but you do know you don't deserve them. Mood
THIS MADE MY DAY OH MY GOD!! amazing video!!
Let’s be clear on this one: THIS ENDCARD was EVERYTHING Oh i can already hear the prinxiety shippers screaming
No joke, this is making me cry
This was my first time hearing guy gals and nonbinary pals since realizing I was nonbinary. I´m crying
Is Nico real I need to know-
I would love to join the patron, but I don't have money also that episodes me in a nutshell with trying to talk to anyone. 😅
We just gonna ignore the fact that virgles eyeshadow was changing between purple and black?
I'm in tears rn because this episode hit little close to home with me. I don't usually talk about stuff like this but I feel like I need to be brave. I am a very social awkward and introverted person, but i am also a pansexual and polyamorous female. i have an amazing partner that I love so much, but before the relationship I was in i was a bad relationship with my ex-girlfriend who was a toxic person.  After that relationship i became scared of talking to people i was crushing on and would often ignore my feelings with probably resulted in losing opportunities at a new relationship all because I was too scared to tell them or even talk to them normally. I wanted to follow my heart but fear just kept taking me over. But I follow became braver until I told someone that I liked them and they liked me back. I still live with those fears but I'm working through them. I'm sorry if this took away from your time, i didn't mean to bother you
Reading the title: dam so this is the beach episode in anime huh
I don't have more of a genuine reaction then AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OMG the stimming and the falppy hands and his eyeshadow was bright purple when he was relaxed and JWLWJDĞDMDÜDMDŞ ADORABLE the artist did an amazing job oh my gosh the gay panic, checking the pins and Hhhhhhhhhhhslrjdşdjfğfkgğglg amazing lovely fancy amazing just omg the bit about lying- JANUSES SECRET CORRIDOR OF REWARDS???????
I died from cuteness. ❤❤❤
Prinxiety is strong on this one
EMO BLUSHED AT PRINCY ALERT!!!   PRINXIETY BABY!!!
I LOVE HOW VIRGIL'S MAKEUP CHANGES DEPENDING ON LIKE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHTS AND HIS EXCITEMENT
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPIER W H A T
Also Virgil eyeshadow changed like from light to dark to light is that a good thing
I love all your vids thomas
Can we bring back the purple hair or something
I can already hear the prinxiety shippers screaming...

VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOWWWWWWWWW I LOVE ITTTTT
3 things  1. Roman. Called. Virgil. Brave. And. There. Were. LITERAL. H E A R T S. *Prinxiety Stan screaming* 2. I wonder what Logan and Patton are thinking. 3. VIRIGLS EYESHADOW CHANGES COLOR WHEN HES HAPPY- WE HAVENT SEEN THIS BEFORE- THAT MEANS HES NEVER BEEN HAPPY-
Roman I saw those hearts you ain’t slick
THE LIGHT EYESHADOW ON VIRGIL WHEN HES HAPPY
I’m sorry but I hate that you pronounce Janus The way you do I’m sorry that’s mean but it’s not pronounced that way and it scares me.
i am so happy that abd could help with this video since i discovered thomas's channel thanks to his fan art. this is like a circle closing
Roman:CoMunIcAtE!! Virgil*gay panic*nOoO Thomas:communicate in the bathroom and make a stranger listen to my sadness
Me: right I have a lot of stuff to do today and-  *new sanders sides video pops up* Me: I have nothing to do today but this.
When you want to enjoy Sanders (A)Sides but there's a political ad every fIVE MINUTES I ALREADY VOTED LEAVE ME ALOOOOOOONNNEEE
Omg Roman and Virgil being bros is something we need more of
“But what if it’s a mistake?”  “Then I’ll add it to the list!”  Roman stans come get your angst (this is a self call out)
I FEEL SO BAD FOR THE GUY IN THE BATHROOM!!! HE WAS SO EMOTIONAL AND IDBDISBDKDBSISNCOCBCB
Thomas you never cease to amaze, this is great and made me so happy, thank you!!!
GUYS THE EYESHADOW
I love this so much
MY BABIES GOT A PATREON HES FINALLY GETTING THE LOVE HE DESERVES..... *you can tell I fricking love Janus with all my heart—*

This was extremely relatable and I really need more pins. And really funny. And adorable. And stickers.
IM CALLING THIS THE PRINXIETY EPISODE

In a Heartbeat vibes
On a serious note, the artists did an absolutely stunning job!! Go give them a follow!!!     Also THOMAS!! The voice acting....How are you perfect at everything?!?
That was the cutest thing I've ever seen! Great work!♥️👏
the PRINXIETY in this episode is immaculate 👌
Flirting? Virgil? Huh
my favorite part of this episode is that the entire dilemma could’ve been avoided if Logan was there
" you're making a mistake! " " if i am, i'll add it to the *list!* "
Our god is back and we love it. This is another thing to add to my list of "Re-watch this over a million times because it's amazing"
This is the most gay panic I’ve ever seen in a episode of anything. ALSO VIRGILS MAKEUP IS AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGG.
Roman: “you’re killing me Virgil”  me: SINCE WHEN HAS ROMAN USED VIRGILS ACTUAL NAME TO REFER TO HIM ?!
SHUT UP IM CRYING DUDE
pRINXIETY STRIKES AGAIN I-
Alternate Title: “Gay Panic: The Mini-Sode”
Roman: *saying some romantic shiz * Thomas: hUh? Roman: Cutie at 12:00. ;-; 😂
Oh Thomas.....that pun was terrible but it was hilarious  and you made it work.
I'm surprised roman and Virgil work together in some of these scenes  Prinxiety fans: *exist*
"Roman you're making a mistake!" "If I am, I'll add it to the list!" Welp, my heart just broke
Ohgodphgodohgodhogod I can't even begin to explain how much I love every single thing about this thank you so much for all the effort you and everyone put into this it's perfect and you're all amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Also I am a little sad that I cant see the extra stuff because I can’t afford it ;-; I hope that this will help the channel but I can afford it ;-;
AAAAAAAA this is so gay Edit: I love it
"what are you doing?!" "I uh I dunno... *Gay panic*  plant?"   My favourite line. Ever.
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO VIRGIL'S EYEBAGS IN THE END THERE?????? VIRGIL SWEETIE YOUR OPTIMISM IS SHOWING?????????
Random comment at the start of the vid, will there be a new intro with all the sides once the last one is revealed and accepted?

Oh my goodness Thomas you've done it again sir. Seeing Virgil be brave was amazing and the new eyeshadow has me shook. It's amazing how it changes from purple to black depending on his mood. The monologue in the bathroom was so beautifully written it tugged at my heartstrings. Stay safe and take care of yourself ilysm ❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I literally love how Virgil pulled up his hoodie when the guy talked to Thomas  SSHSHDHJDDIJD
virgil cares so much about roman- let’s talk about the fact he went out of his confort zone please. thanks.
idk about any of you but I kinda ship prinxiety so I love this 😁 (I know it's not canon but still)
10:35   Wait-     Roman weren’t not just gonna pretend you didn’t just say what you just said.
24:05 Virgil I can’t 😂💖
“Flirting with social anxiety” also know as princxiety shippers free serotonin
Oh so he’s writing a song about Virgil then, so this is just yep
You had me at 'Janus' to get me become your Patreon... BUT that's not the only thing I remember from this episode, hehe *nervous laughter* It was so astonishing, I loved every part of it! Beautiful animations, great story, VIRGIL'S MAKE-UP!!! Can't wait to see more <3 It's always worth waiting, you never fail to amaze me <3
this episode was so cute and sweet and AH THE PRINXIETY❤️💜❤️💜
Oh yesss!! Another sandersides
This was amazing
WAIT WAIT WAIT- DOES ROMAN LIKE VIRGIL?!
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW
THE END HAS PRINCEITY! Why is no one talking about it?
I- dunno..? P l a n t
Any one gonna talk about how at 10:34 after virgl says "you're making a mistake" roman responds with "I'll add it to the list"
Thomas, thank you for still posting! You mean so much to all of us! During this pandemic, we need your happy, silly videos! Thank you again.  -Your fan,             Me
Ok holy smokes those last 2 minutes really hit different, plus they had me smiling like an idiot the whole time!! The changes in Virgil's eyeshadow were also PHENOMENAL
When Virgil gets happy, his bags under his eyes become brighter and more shimmery... as though he is showing true happiness. But when anxiety is needed, his bags turn back to normal. This means that Virgil is always needed, and doesn’t show true happiness like how we saw today, Which is normal, knowing that anxiety may block happiness. It’s just so cool how detailed they put the little things in... anyway, gejshsjvdjdj THIS HIT WAYYYY TO CLOSE TO HOME FOR ME LIKE- GDHGSJRHEK-
just checked out the patreon and the highest tier is sold out, oof
I can't get over the fact that the guy looks like a gay character from my favorite book series
Omg Virgil’s eyeshadow changing from black to purple when he’s not anxious is such a cute detail I love it!
i am THRIVING for the emo references omg
THE EYESHADOW!!! THE EYESHADOW!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Don't mind me just crying ✌😜
How roman doesn’t wanna make anymore mistakes hurts my heart
HHHHHHH VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE EYESHADOW IS MAKING ME HAPPY STIM!!!!!! I've never seen my boy this excited!!! Yes!!!!!!! Prinxiety fans are THRIVING right now, thanks Thomas, Joan, and all the other people that helped make this [I forgot their names I'm sorry D:]!!! ❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜
F i burary     I'll go-
Virgil with purple eye shadow is a go!
ROMAN BIT HIS THUMB AT THOMAS.....THEATRE NERD!!!!!
You cannot say prinxiety isn't real after watching this
Oh. My. Gosh!  This was so cute!  I was squealing on my couch!
8:12 Thomas: "Gay eyes?" Roman: "Gay eyes." Virgil: "Alright... What are gay eyes? " Roman: "oH- OhoH- oh how cute✨"  This has me: 😂 and 🥺💕 at the same time
This entire video is such a mood
Ohhh!! I really liked this :))!!
VIRGIL MY BOY IM SO SO PROUD

I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY

Am I the only one who noticed when Virgil gets happy his eyeshadow turns purple? I just think that's amazing and also cute!!
Omg I love Virgil's new eyeshadow!!!
Dang you youtube and not giving me notifications
5:20 was that a blink 182 reference?
O......M......G THAT WAS AMAZING! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LIVE ACTION VERSION if you can do it that is 😅.
You all know Prinxiety shippers went into overload and exploded. That's the only explanation as to why there aren't 1mil comments
vigils eyeshadow was purple....... VIRGILS EYESHA--AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
I've walked up to people and asked about their pins before lol its not that weird. they were super cute tho
Virgils new eyeshadow I love it!
I saw this and SQUEELED!!!!!!
THE EYESHADOWWWWWWWW OMG
OK google: how to buy a youtube series and put it on television?
I JUST POSTED A COMMEN ABOT PRINXIETY AND THEN I DELETED IT BECAUSE I THOUGT I HD THE WRONG ASPECT WHY DID I DELETE IT!!
Awwww this was so cute. I started  ball my eyes out because of the gayness. Ahhhhh Virgils eyeshadow changes when he shows emotion, it turned  purple  when was excited/happy. Then the black is when he's anxious. AHHHHHHHH I love this SOOO much. I'll watch  this over and over because of how cute it is.❤💜💖💕
"Not interested" "Liar!"
My power went out three days ago and we have no signal so I went outside and sat halfway down my driveway to watch this and it was 100% totally worth it and I’m so happy OH MY GOSHDVDHDJHF
As soon as I get a job I will join your patreon-
This is EXTREMELY relatable and I am also losing it at the constant blink-182 references
This was so cute!
Everyone: Is no one gonna talk about virgils purple eyeshadow???? Pretty much all of the comments: vIGILS EYESHADOW
Did Virgil get new eyeshadow?
THE EYESHADOW OMG VIRGIL
.... so lots of people are talking about the eyeshadow and how cute it is that its purple when he's happy. But that just made me think how if its now canon that when Virgil is really happy the eyeshadow is purple, we have never seen him happy before this video. And that hurt me
Am I the only one who was screaming in excitement along with them at the end?
At the end of the day              SCREW social anxiety.
Thomas you did an amazing job with this. You also gave me a new idea on how to talk to people do I might just do that. Let’s just hope it turns out as good as yours haha 😅
CAN WE APPRECIATE VIRGIL WITH LIGHT PURPLE EYESHADOW
Woaaah virgil's eyeshadow at the end! So cool love that little detail!
Don’t mind me I’m just jamming to the intro
Virgil was real PuShY this episode 😂🖤
Am I the only that noticed Virgil's eyeshadow changing back and forth between shiny purple and the regular black? I honestly think the shiny purple looks really good though.
Omg Virgil's eye shadow
I'm just listening to this and I'm laughing at how funny this is
YES YES YES YES MORE YES
If thomas is finally finding a guy this has just got to be canon in the story.. this man needs to be happy
I SWEAR VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNED PURPLE! I THINK THAT SHOWS WHEN HE’S HAPPY OR IN LOVE OR SOMETHING-
Purple eyeshadow = Virgil is becoming a light side ???
I'm crying  Stupid emotions.
I am LIVING for Virgil with purple eyeshadow!!! (Color changing black/purple was a nice touch)
This is a great birthday gift
Oh my god my heart!!!! I was eating Ramen and holding my little brother and OHOIbSKJB tHIS IS SO DANG CUTE!!!!
MY PRINXIETY HEARRRTTTTTT!!!!! 😭😭❤✨
PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!💜💜💜💜
5:20 Virgil made a Blink 182 reference!!! That’s fantastic!!!  Edit: the band puns and references are amazing!
WAIT! Is Virgil's makeup changing from dark to light purple because he thinks super excited??? Like srhwstheite we never seen that before he look so cuteeee!!!! I loved the whole thing it's so amazing!!! 🥺🥺🥺💖✨
VIRGIL DO IT
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT 14:20 - 14:53????
That video made me smile slot thank you Thomas for making me smile :)
Can I just mention how Virgil eyeshadow is purple 😯
☆ Huuh? ☆...  *delete it.*
"Love is a key ingredient in all the best recipes... after salt" -truer words never spoken
Bro why did I cry? XD
11:51 Why are Virgil and Roman hiding too? From what I remember (correct me if wrong) no one can see the Sides except Thomas.
*Dog borks*  Virgil- AH DEMON
*happy stim happy stim happy stim happy stim*
The practice in the mirror...I can relate so much it's so hard to talk and you just freeze. I love ur content and the animation factor was amazing
Anyone else shaking their hands when Virgil asked to?
Virgil's eyeshadow!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
How can there be dislikes? If you dont like the video, series, or creator, just get off the dang video.
When you realize that Virgils makeup is changing when he’s exited vs anxious 🥺🥺
The fact that this happened to me last night when I completely freaked because my server was gorgeous and so nice  that I flailed and knocked over a tub of pens. I have never related to Thomas more, but I do wish my anxiety had been a bit more brave like Virge.
You really gay?
My heart is so warm! I love it so much it hurts! The animations and editing and voice acting is sopure and great!!!!!!!
Thomas post's a sander side's vid Me :- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
Prinxiety viewers watching this: WE WERE R I G H T
This was so cute, too cute.. Thomas the Dank Engine is the best Thomas Rhymed It was timed And I don't know what oxymoron is have a PLUS ULTRA DAY OR NIGHT! 🍀 👌 😊 😁
Awwwwwwww Thomas gots a boyfriend?! Thats so cute! This made my day I relly need to get out there.
“Speaking from the heart” Me: PATTON?!?!?!?!
spoilers (edited for typos)   "Look, I, I know this is awkward, and, maybe not the best way to strike up a conversation.  I don't really know what to say to you, I honestly don't know what I'm doing at the mall today. I don't know what I was looking for. I guess that answers my question. The mall is where you go if you want something, but you don't know what it is, because the mall has everything, right?  er I don't know a lot about anything, least of all myself. and I feel that the hardest when it comes to knowing what I want.  But I know, that I want to take a chance, and talk to you. I have to, because I don't know, when I'm going to know, what I want, again.  And I know, that if I don't act on these feelings right now, I'm going to regret it. I saw you across the food court, and you were so, radiant. I saw you, and I just knew."
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW UNDER VIRGILS EYES😯😯😯
hmm.. detective Nova has been activated!! OKAY so... in the last clips, virgils eyeshadow (eye'bags'?) have been going from a shimmery purple to the normal black.. and they've been bigger then usual. Maybe Virgil has been feeling a little less anxiety about things? maybe he's been feeling a little better about himself!! but.. maybe it's getting worse, it could be that he's feeling down... hmm. but whatever it is, I'm HERE for it!!! and honestly I'm going to beg my mother to subscribe to the patreon, it's so amazing that thomas has started this!! :D p.s. honestly thomas has helped me so much throughout everything that I'm going through, he's so amazing and he's such an idol to me.. if I had the chance to meet ANYONE in the world it would IMMEDIATELY be thomas sanders, no thought about it! anyways if you stuck around till the end thank you hehe, and if you're going to a hard time and need someone to talk to, my Instagram is @pp_man._ (yes the name is weird lol) I'll always be here to listen! have an amazing day y'all!
I shouldn't have lost my crap so much when i saw this,thank you Thomas and the team for the happiness you give me :)
Oh my god those proud eyes of Rowan when he looked at Thomas from afar
i- is does virgils eyeshadow change colours with how he's feeling?! i love thatttt!!!
Anybody else notice that Virgil’s eyeshadow changed to light purple when he was really happy?! 🥺💖
Those 16 dislikes are all Karen's 😤😤
If this were an actual anime, I would totally watch it
22:34 - literally me during the whole video
SEROTONIN GO BRRRRR📈📈📈📈📈
I would love to see a live action rendition of this Thomas..  This was very beautifully written, as usual..  I rewatched it again with my eyes closed and I could distincly hear the difference between yourself, Roman, and Virgil.  It really is quite genius how you have given such distinctive voices and personalities to each of your characters..  keep up the good work my friend, can’t wait for the next Sanders Sides/Asides😊❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🌈🥰
Yep. I'm gonna need a live action remake of this ASAP! I need to see this in action! Please please please!!! Also, I have to point out, Virgil has purple under his eyes when he's giddy!!!! SO CUTE!!!!!!
It is a mood to try to get know someone whether for friend or partner.
I DID NOT EXPECT TO CRY THAT HARD ON A SATURADY AFTERNOON WHAT THE HECK
I loved this sooooo much! My best friend and I are total fangirls over all that Thomas does, we love how he makes us laugh
"First 1000 people are getting this t-shirt and-"  *LEAVES VIDEO TO GET NEW JANUS MERCH AND SUPPORT MY FAVORITE CREATOR*
THE EYE SHADOW HAS ME SHOOK!
I want to pledge so bad ,but I can't because my parent's, Thomas sanders if you ever read this....THANK YOU FOR BEING AMAZING!!! YOU ARE MY HERO!!! you saved me from alot.....and truly I thankyou.....So just Know I am forever loyal to your channel. Thank you for this amazing ep.
YES, I love Virgil's purple eyeshadow! This episode put me through so many emotions, honestly, I'm a full Virgil stan now. The hints of Roman angst really did hurt tho. This is one of my favorite episodes!
ok I'm kinda sad that I can't pay patreon because I started daydreaming about helping write this and hahsh the pain
Virgils eyeshadow changing is the most amazing thing, when he shows that he has no worries and hes happy his eyeshadow is purple, this opens so many opportunities as a cosplayer. I'll be right back, totally not getting into my Virgil cosplay rn
Omg! I love this!! Thomas this was so good!
THE TEAMWORK
This episode was well worth the wait.
HEY YALL PRINXIETY SHIPPERS! HERE'S THE TEA BOOOOOIS!(girls,non-binary and genderfluid peeps) Me:*downloading patreon just to see it * ... Virge's 'eyeshadow' changes colours!!!! ANOTHER DISCOVERY!!!! I was hoping that the next side will show up though-
Prinxiety???!!!   Also I FEAKING LOVE VIRGIL'S CHANGING EYESHADOW! !!!!!! That was an amazing detail!
WAIT so has Virgil's eyeshadow been confirmed to not be makeup, but a part of him??? :DDD (also THE PRINXIETYYYY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M SO HAPPY AND FULFILLED)
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is I think my new favourite thing also "gerard gay" might just be my new favourite line ever
THIS IS THE MOST RELATABLE THING IVE EVER SEEEEEN 😂💕💗💕💖 AAA I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! AND IT’S EVEN BETTER SINCE ROMAN AND VIRGIL ARE HERE!! Damn Thomas really knows how to make people’s days 😂❤️
Prinxiety strikes again! I love this video so much. I hope this was actually a real thing for Thomas, minus all the blunders 😅. I hope you're doing well Thomas, I hope your living your best life while you can in quarantine still. Also side note: I love the attention to Virge's eyeshadow changing and that I thought the title was, "Flirting WITH social anxiety" so i thought it was going to be roman and virgil flirting back and fourth with each other.
I'm sorry but from the lesson I could've learned from this I only payed attention to the fact that at the very end Virgil gave Roman a look that made me squeel
Omg that's so cuute!!! I've missed all of you so muuch!! I love this too much!!!
THAT MAKEUP
YES YES GES YES YES OH MY GOSH YES
That was so gay I love it 🥰  Edit virgils eyeshadow is purple at the end I love
I love the small references to the other sides!  Janus: the most obvious one, when he was lying Logan: We need to make a plan Patton: Speak from the heart
VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW- VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! I REPEAT- THIS IS NOT A DRILL! VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!!
WERE THOSE WAIFU FLOWERS
prinxiety stans come get y’all juice
EXCITED VIRGIL EXCUSE ME SIR IM 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"shut up emo" MY PRINXIETY HEART CANT TAKE THIS?? HELLO THOMAS WTH???
This is a good episode on knowing when to and how to dive into somethings and seeing your last chance. That shits hard, with actual generalized anxiety on toonof that its ROUGH!
This was soooo worth the wait I love this
I'M SCREAMING AND CRYING THIS IS AMAZING
Thomas: *uploads* Me: *rises from my blankets* PRINCEY X VIRGE TIME YAAAAYYYYYY
VIRGILS EYESHADOW SPARKLES WHEN HES HAPPY?? W H A T?? WHAT??
The prinxiety shippers are dying i can hear it... or maybe thats just me. Actually im pretty sure its all of us
"Shut up Emo." So adorable 😍 💖 Virgil this poor baby! You are so conflicted and scared, its okay! The road to life is paved with love and fear, sometimes you need to do the things that scare you the most.
Okay but did anyone notice when Virgil is happy the eyeshadow is purple but when he starts questioning himself it turns black and thicker
Roman's face at 14:55 : "dude..." 😂😂
food and thomas sanders, perfect day :)
As a social introvert this was hard to watch for me. Very heartwarming though
I’ M CRYING. IT’S SO GOOOOOD 😭
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY AAAAAA SO CUTE!!!!!
Heyyyy daniii!!!
😍VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW!Also the angst coming from Roman🥺.... this episode is just...  Relatable😭
Purple sparkling eyeshadow?
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW
Hey Dani
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! I loved this chapter, this hits a little close to home but BOI the animatic was amazing!! It was so nice watching Roman and Virgil working together, and THEY'RE SMILING. THEY'RE HAPPY!!! I needed this shot if serotonin, you truly are an angel, Thomas Sanders Edit: ALSO the "I'll add it to the list" part Roman is still not fine but he's BETTER and the fact we're not ignoring his problems anyone give me happiness
In just 38 minutes this video already has 60k views
VIRGIL'S UNDER EYES CHANGED FROM BLACK TO SPARKLEY PURPLE JWFOWJEB

Patton ;(
THE LIES OH MY GOSH YES
I love this! It was so cute I just ahhhhhh!!! I also love how Virgil's eyeshadow changed between purple and black in the last part. Whether it was a nudge towards how his warming up to others or feeling more like a light side, I thought it was cute.
*DEEEEEEEEP INHALE* I SMELL PRINXIETY
VIRGIL IS SOO CUTE AND SWEAT AND SOOOOOO ADORABLE
🥺🥺 SO CUTEE
Totally gonna spend my time today rewatching this masterpiece. Everything was beautiful the animation, the voiceovers, the embarrassment, the gay panic and to top it off DID ANYONE NOTICE AT THE END VIRGIL HAD PURPLE EYESHADOW AND NOT BLACK!? I. LOVED. THAT. 💜
Damn I’m only 45 minutes early
oh my gosh just *watching* this is making me anxious! Thanks Virgil and Roman, you two make an amazing team when it comes to stuff like this!
YOU GUYS VIRGILS EYESHADOW MY GODDDDDD
Virgils purple eyeshadow is so pretty!
I am living for the animation! This ep was so good! You all should be extremely proud of this one especially in the situation you were all out in! 🥺
prinxiety shippers are SHAKING in their boots rn omg
*g a y  e y e s*
VIRGIL HAS NEW EYESHADOW!!! HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW
I waited so long for this SANDER SIDES THANK YOU LORD The poor innocent baby 😍 Anxiety
You'd think his head would turn into Jacksepticeye's head during that "top of the morning". It IS in Thomas's perspective instead of reality after all
ONE: Did anyone notice Virgil's eye shadow? TWO: HIS FLIPPING SMILE❤️💜😆 THREE: We should call our selves Thomas Fanders
I screamed the entire time
Yess more
Virgil's bravery! Roman's self realization! Thomas being his usual anxious cute self! And the cherry on top, seeing Virgil be so animated and excited in the end! (Plus seeing them walk to their usual spots) So many details throughout the whole episode, love this! I really want to join your patreon, hopefully I can do that soon! 💙
"Idk..plant...." 😂
I've never seen a gay panic represented so perfectly
Yay new video!!!
Omg the eyeshadow in the end credits <3 <3 <3
No one:  Thomas: I don't know....plant
I LITERALLY SCREAMED WITH PURE JOY AT THIS OML 😭💖😭💖✨💗
This is very accurate- like... WAY too accurate.
Spoilers!             Omg omg omg VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYELINER....AAAAHHHHHH😳😍
OMG I LOVE THIS JAJEHEHEHEH
You're not dead— I mean you're alive. I mean welcome back huhu I miss you Thomas! AHHHH ^_^
This was one of the cutest episodes ever now has to be my favorite
My only words are ahhhhhhhhhnhjjjhhhhhhhhhhh
Roman calls Virgil Gerard Gay: me being an MCR fan, you didn't- And then how Virgil pushes Thomas at the end was so beautiful!!
This couldn’t be more beautifully perfectly the most  beautiful totally the perfectest very bestest!! ❤️❤️❤️  i love everything  about this 💋💋💋
Ahh I loved this
i am DEVASTATED that i don’t have enough money to contribute to the patreon 😭
I KNEW someone would come out of one of the stalls I KNEW it goddammit
Yes, I'd like to order a Virgil with glittery eyeshadow
VIRGELS EYE SHADOW!!!!!!!!
10:46 is now one of my new favorite quotes
THIS IS SO FLIPPING CUTE I CANT-
I went on tiktok and comment “when is your next sanders sides video” and 10 minutes later I get a notification of you updated a vid
Wonderful Video. Also am I the only on that notice that Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing?
WHEN VERGIL IS HAPPY HE HAS GLITTERY PURPLE EYESHADOW THATSSOCUTE
This was so wholesome! I loved it! Also can we PLEASE talk about Virgils eyeshadow??? Purple has to mean optimism or something because he was all happy and adorable and it was purple then when Thomas was worrying it was black again
iM nOt ReAdY!!!!!  Edit 1: VIRGIL!!!!! I mIsSeD yOu!!  Edit 2: i KeEp ScReAmInG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Edit 3: I. Can't. Stop. Panicking. And. It's. Been. Ten. Minutes.  Edit 4: iM pAnIcKiNg EvEn MoRe!!!!! JANUS, I MISSED YOUUUUUU
I have a lot of thoughts about this episode and most of them are **enthusiastic screaming**
That made me SO HAPPY. Thank you Thomas and everyone that worked on this 💕
Woohooo!!! NEW VIDEO

Can we just say that for once are little Virgil is HAPPY 😃 AND SMILING
Omg Virgil screaming "Don't tell me to relax" is literally my reaction when I'm trying to not get stresses but someone else says "shouldn't you hurry?"
I would love to watch a show like this
Y'ALL DID THAT
this was so cute 🥺. I almost started tearing up at the end of the animation.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaa ok I’m all happy now lol
12:44 this is. for personal use.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW ROMAN IS BASICALLY CONFIRMED A HIMBO JEJDHSMMSNSNSHDJDJJ
:0 does Virgil’s eyeshadow turn purple when he’s excited!?!? Or did I not see it correctly-
PRINXIETY IS CANON!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHOLESOME WHOLESOME WHOLESOME 🤩
That poor guy in the bathroom though, broke his heart.
20:31    Pff- Thomas has lashes  *le gasp* VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE AND BLACK!!DOES THIS CHANGE DEPENDING ON HOW HE FEELS??
OMG  my heart! I love the switching of the eyeshadow, the theories are running wild on discord
YAY!!!!! Go Virgil!!!! 💜💜 the last push man!! This turned out so well!! Nice job!
11:02 Jacksepticeye reference... Nice.
Virgil's eyeshadow looks amazing!!! and also it's nice to see Roman happy...               that probably won't last long tho...
I love virgils new makeup
Literally screaming at how awkard Thomas is and *AHHH*

THIS DAY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!! FIRST MY TEAM WON OUR SOCCER GAME!!! NOW ANOTHER SANDERS ASIDES!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Are we not gonna talk about  how Roman said if I am I'll add it to the list ( of mistakes) like ow my heart
So correct me if I'm wrong, but when Virgil is happy his eyeshadow is sparkly bright royal purple and when he's not it's deep dark gloomy black?
did anyone else notice that V's eyeshadow goes purple when he is happy or excited?
The way Virgil eyeshadow goes to purple when he is happy is such a good little detail that I love
23:18 is Virgils eyeshadow black? Then it goes back to purple?
I love Roman and Virgil's dynamic in this one.
Has Virgil alway had purple eyeshadow. If not YAS
Its official. Janus isn't a snake. Hes a dragon.
dude i love virgils eyeshadow
The only thing I have to say after watching is that I have so many emotions and I may make a reaction video upon my second watch through.
I'm crying im haodsonasinreoifbdiusdoghehaffdilghlfdiglfiufdligdfg Okay so let me give mu uneducated opinion on my favourite details: 1. Virgil pushing Thomas forward when he saw how dejected Roman was. 2. The old jokes. 3. Virgil' changing eyeshadow. 4. "It's in France." "I'm listening." 5. Everything about Janus' corridor of stored rewards.
KAHDIDHEUR EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS JUST- SUPER COOL AND SINCE IM ALSO AN ARTIST THIS IS LIKE- EVEN BETTER SKDDKDHKFKF
Can we please see this in real life... I want to see Thomas knocking over the bin. Also, why is nobody talking about Virgil shouting demon at the dog?!
IS THAT NEW UNDER EYE SHADOW FOR ANXIETY!!!
i love the intro
This is one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen
17:14 omg the desperate look on Virgil's face is literally saying "oh no the prince is sad! Just get the guts to make him AND Thomas happy for once!" Like... Omg so cute :3 than he be like "to be honest I don't know what that was..." It was the gayness for the prince ! Sooo now when Virgil is a happy boi he has pastel purple eyeshadow that's so freaking cuteeee
Oml yes I'm early-

VIRGIL'S EYE SHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HE'S HAPPY!!!!!!!!! 🥰🥰 That's like the cutest thing ever!!!!
That was so so so cute!!!! 😁
I was on the same anxiety roller coaster that T.S. was. With laughter thrown in. This was awesome.
But Virgil’s eyeshadow tho-
I think I squeeled the entire episode being all happy and laughing. My God, I haven't smiled like that in while. My face hurts.
It’s 3:00am, and I have work in a couple hours- but it was worth it. *so freaking worth it*
That Blink 182 reference though
Perfection, I can't, I just can't 😆😆😆
OMG THIS EPISODE IS SO ADORABLE AAAA THANK YOU YOU ANGELIC BEING FOR GIVING US THIS
This whole video is second hand embarrassment and I can not take it 😅
MISTER SANDERS YOU ARE PLAYING WITH KY HEART I CAN’T HANDLE ITTT
virgil’s eyeshadow changing is precious, but is nobody going to talk about how Virgil wanted Thomas to do the flappy hand stim???? it’s so wholesome...
me being too poor to pledge to thomas' patreon but really wanting to support him: *sad gay noises*
The monologue??    I was in tears-
It's amazing!!!!  Prinxeity it's really happening!!!! SHIP IT♡♡
Is the sneak peak for the next episode or for patreon??
Patron.. **cries in minor without a job or money**
19:20 just adding this to the list of things that makes me happy 💙
This video is utterly fantastic and it absolutely made my day! You guys are amazing and I love you!
*I see two gay couples*
This was SO good and adorable!!! Also, Virgil with purple eyeshadow?! That's so pretty!!! As always, fantastic work by the team!
This is awesome lol
VIRGIL HAD PURPLE EYE SHADOW ON THEN IT TURNED BLACK AT THE END WHAT DOES IT MEEEEEAAAANNNN
That was so good
Im literally freaking out iblove this so much like ahhhh.
PRINXIETY ANIMATIC EPISODE??? thank you so much thomas, regardless of the technical circumstance
11:03 im dying omg
I don't know what to say... Wow... Could be Gayer
VIRGIL'S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!! IS HE BECOMING BRAVERY OH MY GOD
No I wasn’t testing you, I was just panicking
I think this was my favorite episode yet. Even though it was an animatic (though I just adore the artists style! So cute!) it was so filled with emotion and heart. Teared up a bit at the end when Virgil just SHOVED him and it started to all click! The episodes are always worth waiting for!
Seeing Virgil and Roman genuinely happy at the same time just brings me so much joy!!!
THIS IS AMAZING AHHHHHHHHHH thank you so much Thomas to you, your friends and team for working so hard during these tough times to get this masterpiece out! Now if you don’t mind me, I’m just gonna rewatch this another 50 times 😆
"ToP oF tHe MoRnIn' To Ya"

I loved this episode's plot and seeing Virgil and Roman come together on this. Then the purple eyeshadow at the end was a fabulous touch, well done Quil. Congrats to everyone who worked on this episode. I absolutely adored it. My heart is so full. (That end card is the most wholesome thing ever too, oh my gosh. Those boys. <3 )

Thomas is in his 30s?
THE FLAPPY HANDS
I saw the title of the video for like half a second before I reflexively swiped the notification away.  All I saw was "Flirting with Anxiety"  Instead of the logical conclusion to come to which was "Flirting /with/ Anxiety" indicating flirting while dealing with social anxiety .  My mind immediately went to "Flirting with /Anxiety/" or flirting with Virgil.   My immediate response was : "Well that's definitely not what I was expecting."  Anyway this was awesome. Awesome job from the artists.
T: "Gay eyes?" R: "Gay eyes." V: "What are gay eyes?" Me, a straight: "Oh thank god that's not getting glossed over."
I was in the middle of making a parody video when this dropped I have never clicked so fast! Ahhh! Also I love the art style and Virgil's eyeshadow changing when he's excited and anxious omg I love this can't wait for the next episode
OMG, that was everything!!!!!!!! Please, I so wanna to see this in live-action!
Virgil at end end: Shake your hands, walk around a lot, do you have to pee? Me: *literally about to jump up from excitement and pace around after watching this* Ah, so you're the one who's doing this, Anxiety
"Will Deceit continue to be your answer down the road?  Is that fair to him?" I don't know why, but when I first heard that I didn't think "him" referred to the other person in the relationship, but instead to Deceit.  In the series we've seen what happens when Thomas listens too much to one side and the effects it has on that side.  If Deceit suddenly takes the lead, will he be effected like that too?  Does this mean that Virgil still cares for Janus?
THAT.WAS.SOOOOOO.CUUUUUTTTTTTE
THE EYE SHADOW IM CRYING
Haheuehjeuebehiwhevwnjehenieneiusbwkeube THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!
PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Ok but like after Virgil pushed Thomas it was just a truckload of Prinxiety and I love it. This whole episode was so frickin adorable lol

When Virgil started hyperventilating, I got so scared because I knew what could come next. But it didn’t happen, Virgil was brave. I wish I could be like that 💜🖤
Virgil called Janus Deceit 😭
I saw ABDIllustrates and lost it
BLOOPERS NOW!!!!!
I loved this Asides episode so much! The animatic format was so fun to watch, you have such great artist friends! And the story was heartfelt and funny and a wonderful way to start my day. Plus Virgil’s eyeshadow turning purple when he’s excited!!  All in all, amazing. Nico fan club, anyone? 💕
I saw those hearts thomas! You ship prinxiety too!
wow prinxiety shippers really getting fed today huh?

K not gon lie I woke up like two minutes ago I was scrolling through my notifications then I noticed the vid but at first I thought it was something but I looked closer and I realized it was this and now I am screaming inside!!
HE HE TURNED PURPLE CAUSE HE WAS HAPPY?!?! HE TURNED PURPLE WHEN HE WAS HAPPYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*GAY PRINXIETY SCREAMING* also can we talk about virgils makeup??????????
Guys i think if virgil has the purple eyeshadow he’s no longer a ‘bad’ thing maybe he is like idk...excitement?
It’s been so long since a Sanders Sides video has premiered! What a wonderful wonderful surprise! Thank you Thomas and friends!!!💜💜
*THOMAN THE DANK ENGINE AND FRIENDS ARE BACK*
The switching of eyeliner colors, I love it
Here before the Shippers
Hey Thomas! I really wanted to join your patreon (almost typed Patton-) but I don't know if is going to be possible,BUT, Imma still try, and then tell you if I can or not, also, imma replay this vídeo again, is too good to be true ❤️
I don’t know if i’ve ever cried this much at sanders sides but here we are
IM SO HAPPY THAT THIS IS FINALLY HERE this is an AMAZING piece of animated cinema
Ok ✨time to cosplay some virgil✨
Me: crying because final scenes hit close to home Patreon: joined The team: so wonderful and talented
I love the fact that even though Virgil and Roman constantly have their differences and fight, they always come together for Thomas, because they both remember that making Thomas happy is what they truly want.
And look at that, a dramatic zoom on Virgil. Guys I don't think he's ready for this
ohmygodthatwassocuteaaaaa
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE I MISSED YOU YAYYYY
Me everytime I see my crush:  oh, I’m not interested   My entire brain; lier
THIS EPISODE IS JUST *MWAH* My prinxiety heart! I’m also extremely happy that Thomas got to voice act a whole episode since he said he wanted to try doing some voice acting.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Virgil's eyeshadow is purple that's so cool
This is soooooo amazing!!!!!!!!!
Thanks to that eyeshadow detail Thomas is totally forgiven for not having Vergil appear at all in the last Sanders Sides vid
Thank you for making this.
The gay eyes.
This was so freaking adorable 😭🖤 I love this
After that Roman angst and Virgil not even being in last episode, I needed this
This is my favorite episode of Sanders Sides. And omg as a lesbian this is soooo relatable....... not the end the pins one hundred percent the pins and stickers
The change in eye shadow at the end was such a good detail to put in fricking *chef kiss*
Prinxiety shippers: *sees title* WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE!?
I've never been sadder to not have a credit card and or PayPal in my life
theory: Virgil is turning into a light side. as you see from 22:00 his eye shadow switches from a purple when he’s talking positively and a black when negatively. it’s change and development in his characteristics!!
This was so cute!!! I loved it!!!
Ok so Virgil’s eye shadow changes based on his emotions, bright purple when he is happy and black when he is sad or, well uh, anxious.
1. THIS IS AWESOME!  2. With all the lying, i’m surprised Janus didn’t make an appearance  3. Did i mention how awesome this is? 4. I love how Roman and Virgil go straight to they’re little spots at the end 5. I’ve never seen Virgil so happy
VIRGIL SMILING!!!!
I'm gonna take a screenshot 16:18 and use it as a meme or wallpaper. Lol.
alsolil theory but the purple eyehadow thing??? Might be when Virgil is.. "happy-panicking"?? idk but it's surely something like that sksjsks
I think this is the most relatable video you've ever made
23:38 SAAAAAME
If you need me I'll be here rewatching this fifty times over
Happy/Excited Virgil - Purple eyeshadow under his eyes. Normal/Highly Anxious Virgil - Black eyeshadow under his eyes. That is adorable. 🥺😍
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I NEEDED THIS RIGHT NOW
Seeing Roman happy was amazing!!!!
WHO DARE DISLIKE THE VIDEO! Why does it have 27 dislikes. You clicked major cuteness and gay content and you got it who disliked?! 😤
*Ok but that purple eye shadow Virgil was wearing....*   *SHUT UP* I WAS FANGIRLING SOOOOOOOO HARD  WHAT THE-
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen with my own two eyes
OMG THE   P O W E R  D U O
Everything about this is perfect
Wait, is this Thomas’s way of saying he has a boyfriend or a love interest??
23:39 *HAPPY STIM HAPPY STIM VERY HAPPY STIMMING MY ADHD HEART IS* **SCREAMING**
gay panic for 24 minutes
THE SUBTLE PRINXIETY AT THE END...
andhakdhsjdj i love it how virgils eyeshadow goes sparkly purple when he’s happy/exited!!!!! it’s such a cool detail!!!!!!
I'M DYING I'M DYING I'M DYING And I'm sad cause i can't subscribe to patrion(((((
I- hhhhhhhhhhhhhh the excitement I had while watching was just overwhelming There is so much to unpack but like- VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW?!? I’m dying like actually dying I’m going to watch this on repeat for the next three months until Thomas says he is starting to do more sanders sides stuff
Is no one talking about that cute purple eyeshadow when Virgil gets excited ??
Virgil's eyeshadow changes color when he's excited!!! And it sparkles!!!!!! I love it! So many ideas
It's interesting that, in the end-card, Virgil's eyeshadow seemed to change from black to purple when he was happy or excited.
OMG I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT SO MUCH EEEEEEEEE I LOVE IT
"We've gathered some of our artist friends to help us out"  Me: so sides may be in the same frame, like roman and virgil.. chaotic, i like it!  Me * sees roman and virgil in the same frame *: oHMYGOD ROMAN AND VIRGIL ARE IN THE SAME fRAME

I'm so happy this was here today
Well, I know what I will be watching all day...  This and every single react video I find
Omg!!!!!!!! I love this episode soooo much! I was fangirling soooo hard the whole entire episode :)
This is so good and I’m low-key crying-
This is good and sad at the same time I love it
HAHAHAHA!!!! 🤣🤣 I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! I feel this because I hear the same in my own mind.
Is it just me or I feel like our little Remus is left out he's the only dark side who hasn't been accepted yet
19:47  My heart: * *internal screeching* *

MY HEART IS SCREAMING PRINXIETY AT THE END OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
I know this will get lost in the comment section but, I just wanted to say thank you to Thomas and his friends, and everyone who made this series possible. It's the reason I'm proud of who I am, it gave me an amazing group of friends, it has done so much for me, and I'm sure so many people. Thank you so much.
Ok so new favourite episode. That was just mmmm amazing
This just reminds me of what it's like at my school when I see a gay guy
This made me cry God dammit Thomas!
Oh my god Roman and Virgil are the worst. I'm just waiting for Mr. Logic.
I can't get over Virgil pushing Thomas into talking to the guy just to help Roman feel better 😭❤
I've paused at "HoWs ThE wIfE?" and I need a moment.  Because I can't breathe
i just realized when Virgil is like happy and not really anxious his eyeshadow is purple but when he’s anxious it turns back to black
Anxiety’s eyeshadow OMG 🥰
Bro 😳 that's kinda gay
I HAVE MISSED THESE SO MUCH!!!!!
Virgil has purple eyeshadow ?? It keeps switching colors!!
Does anyone else just get a feeling Thomas is gonna upload soon and he does? Even more than that, he uploads topics that just so happen to be floating in my mind. He spooky.  Also this is adorable.
_The level of Virgil x Roman in this makes me so happy I-_
AHHH Virgil's eyeshadow in the end ahhhhhhh i llove it
I'm actually shrieking omg xdd
Did any one else notice Virgils eye shadow kept changing
Okay Virgil with purple eyeshadow..??? AND SMILING????  *bisexual panic*
Am I the only one that noticed that Virgil's eyeshadow was purple at some moments🤨🤨??? Something is changing! Whether it's good or bad I am definitely here for it!😁😁
SO MUCH PRINXIETY 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
First! I love how Virgils eyeshadow switches! I don’t know? Is because of his feelings? And god! Virgil and Roman was actually together about something! (Let the ship sail) This is one of my favorite vids you made Thomas! It’s amazing! Corona actually brought something good to the world! Thank you for lighting my day Thomas! Thank you so much!
Did anyone see Virgil’s eyeshadow change!? It was purple and then it changed to black! I’m so happy for my emo boy!💜
VIRGILS EYESHADOW OMG I LOVE IT
Oh my god happy Virgil with purple eyeshadow makes me so happy
I’m happily flapping my hands
Just finished the video not even a minute ago & I already have a new AU where Virgil & Roman are matchmakers and help people find love etc...
this is absolutely gonna be my new comfort episode !!!
Omg this was so sweet ❤️
Virgil's eye shadow kept changing at the end between a lightish purple and the nirmal black.
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW THO!!!
The confessing of the crush had me crying... 🖤
Omg I love how virgils- eye shadow keeps switching off from purple to black it's like he gets purple eyeshadow from being happily stressed a A
VIRGILS PURPLE EYESHADOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Did anybody else see how Virgil‘s eyeshadow was purple!!! It was purple when he was excited and happy!!! It made me excited and happy!!!! EEEEEEE!!!! It just made me happy!!! It made me happy to see Virgil so happy! And Roman especially after the last episode!!!! I would love to see this live action!! And this just made my day!
This was so cute!!!!!!💖💖💖💖❤️💜❤️💜
Yeeessssssssssssss love you
i knew that anxiety was going to push Thomas "being afraid of missing a fabulous opportunity" and MAN Virgil was saying exactly the same thing as my anxiety          oh and-LIAR😂
I loved the changes in virgils eyeshadow. how he got thomas to stim when he said "I'm gonna need you to do something with your hands, their just hangin there" made me really happy
THOMAS IM ONLY 15 AND WORKING ON GETTING A JOB SO I DON’T HAVE ANY MONEY BUT JUST KNOW THAT IF I DID I’D GIVE YOU ALL OF IT YOU AMAZING HUMANNNN!! Lol seriously you do more for me and my mental health for free then paying for therapy does so thank you and expect another patron once I get a job because you deserve it :)❤️❤️❤️
Love it
I totally misunderstood the title...
So I just finished this... and it hits just as hard as every time I watch a Sanders Sides episode. This was incredible! Oh and uh Prinxiety shippers (me) called, THEY WANT THEIR HEARTS BACK
*My Prinxiety senses are tingling*
this is the best thing ever happen OMG virgil and roman and thomas and a animation AMAZING I also would have gone in the trashcan and VIRGLS EYESHADOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
I think everyone noticed that when anxiety was happy his eye makeup (I don't know the name) went black to purple or dark to light.
the second hand embarrassment in this one was intense but so worth it <3
OMG TJAT WAS AMAXING DHHDJSJS YeS-
I love this so much!!! I absolutely love the animation style too!!!
We NEED more nico, he needs to be a reoccurring character, AND VIRGIL BLUSHING AHHHHH

VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW OMG
Gosh! This was A Great Episode! Lil Thomas looks like He's Learning More! And Having More Chances, too!   Plus, did anyone notice how His Voice Changed When he Turned Around And Said "DOGS."?-

I am crying because this is soooo adorable, relatable and awesome. I am going to watch this video again and again and again, I will never stop. I couldn’t have asked for a better sander sides video update! I am absolutely obsessed, and I have to say I loved the slight Prinxiety in the video 💘🥰
WOAHHH I LOVE THIS

Wait does that mean Prinxiety is cannon-
VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW 😱😱😱🤩🥳🤩🥳🤩🥳
VIRGILS EYESHADOW  OH MY GOD 🥺💜💜💜💜
anyways im ✨crying✨ THAT WAS SO CUTE 🥺🥺😭
Oh my gosh I loved that!  And I'm super excited about the Patreon!
Did anyone else notice that Virgil’s eyeshadow changed from the regular black to this glittery purple from time to time?      just me? ok
I DONT HAVE ANYTHING SMART TO SAY BUT OMFG YES I LIVE FOR THIS-
I loved this so !!!!
Okay, awesome video, but why is no one talking about Virgil’s eyeshadow turning purple when he’s excited and happy!!!!!! Awesome video as always Thomas
To, Virgil's eyeshadow change at the end. From a sparkly purple to his usual black as his mood changed was a nice touch.
The one part tho that was Prinxiety and no one can tell me otherwise
Virgils eyeshadow!!!! eeekkk
Did anyone else notice that in the endcard when Virgil was happy/excided that his eyeshadow turned purple and at the bottom white and when he wasn´t happy/Excited like right at the end that it turned black again?
VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY OR EXCITED OH MY I LOVE IT
VIRGIL IS SOOOOO HAPPY NOW OMG THIS MADE ME CRY A LOT UGHH I AM GOING TO REWATCH IT AGAIN I NEVER SEEN VIRGIL SO HAPPY IN MY LIFE!!!
Bro's! I am literally crying with tears of joy right now! I loved this so much!!! <3<3<3
i thought V said he's gonna find darker eye shadow........................why is it light violet OwO
Dog: *barking* Virgil: aAaH DEMON-
What’s with the eyeshadow? I feel theorys brewing
Omg, I love that Virgils eyeshadow turning purple when he is happy!
Omg the eyeshadow thing was soooooo perfect. Is this something that only happens when he's truly happy? Like how he has a demon voice when he's extremely anxious? I smell the fanfics brewing
Waitttttt Virgil with purple eyeshadowwwww Virgil with purple eyeshadow Virgil with purple eyeshadow!!!! Also does that mean he’s happy?!?!? Wait hang on I have so many questions but VIRGIL LOOKS SO GOOD WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW
This video really made my day! Thank you so much thomas and crew!!
Ok first. Kfhbisnbjfvjdshcbj. Second. Purple? Purple eye shadow? Is that a thing when he’s happy. I hope so because it’s cute. I thought it was a mistake at first cause of the first split second of black then I realized happy and anxious corresponded with the colors. Also since talyn normally does his make up, good on Thomas for doing good eye shadow!
You are meeeeeeee coming back after 3 months
My heart. It's full of appreciation of this art.
I'M SO PROUD OF VIRGILL AGHHHHHHHHHHHH THEY WAY HE PUSHED THOMAS TO TALK TO THE GUY
Yess! Thomas... why are all of these scenarios with Virgil and Roman just the worlds biggest mood ever? I feel called out by this whole video
Virgil had purple eyeshadow
THE FLAPPY HANDS OH MY GOD
also the ending??? with virgil’s eyeshadow? damn.
AAA
“The only logical next step, go home and regret everything.” Mood
I'm crying NEW THOMAS CONTENT
Was this based on a true story?
Well that was beautiful in every way- OMG THAT WAS AMAZING
10:44 “What are you doing?” “I dunno, plant”
purple eyeshadow virgil :)
Yay!!!
That was amazing! Great job to the artists and to you Thomas for making this possible during these tough times.        (Also that JackSepticEye reference was on point.)
I'm halfway through the video and I'm just gonna guess that Roman is the reason Thomas wants to lie? Or like the reason he pretends? Idk how to explain it. (This is about the scene after the bathroom, where Virgil talks about how Thomas is lying)        Edit: I was kinda right?-
YESSSSSSSSS
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES TO PURPLE WHEN HE'S INLOVE I THINK WHICH PROBABLY CONFIRMS THAT WHEN HE'S RELAXED DURING A PERIOD OF TIME, HIS EYESHADOW GETS LIGHTER AND IF HE'S MORE STRESSED THEN IT GETS DARKER AHH
oh my goodness my frickin heart (not even over thomas and the poet) virgil frickin did a thing and it was awesome bc hes an anxious boi but he wanted Roman and Thomas to be happy more than he feared embarrassment, and the frickin purple eyeshadow im frickin dead
But in all fairness they end card is my reaction everytime a new episode comes out
wow this makes me anxious
This made my day so much better  Thank you so much, Thomas!!
"Join me no think!" MOOD
VIRGIL ROCKIN THAT PURPLE EYESHADOW 💜💜
thomas, i know you were super nervous about how you had to go around COVID stuff. but this was so amazing. you and the team did an incredible job and this was so heartfelt and wonderful. thank you so much for this.
Gosh, as someone who doesn't have social anxiety this was a wild ride. I was constantly like, go up and say you saw his pins and wanted to check them out or noticed the stickers on his computer. Go say hi, sorry to bother you, but I'd like to know if you'd enjoy some company. Omg this was so hard to watch as an extravert!!! Love the art though! Amazing work and amazing talent here!!!
Im not gonna lie I was happy stimming that enttire timeeEEEEEE and now im shaking so my typing is very bad BUT I LOVE IT BHVYCFDGCFFGJVJCFXJVMHJVKGHGGH
OMG THE FACT THAT VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE WHEN HES EXCITED IS SO CUTE
there is SO MUCH im gonna keep thinking about for days but VIRGILS EYESHADOW AND THE P U R P god i love how much effort goes into styling the sides (also this episode was incredible, as always, much love to the whole crew!!)
SPOILERS       YALL VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGED BASED OFF OF HIS AFFECT ON THOMAS LIKE WHEN HES HAPPY ITS PUPRLE ANF SPARKLEYSKFHKASLS
Princey has officially made me cry-

Didn’t see anyone comment this but the fact that virgils eyeshadow is changing from purple to black is just amazing I love it.
This was amazing!!!!
my little gay heart is bursting i love this so much!!!!
12:30
I came here faster than the speed of gay and watched it through, this was so cute! Loved it. :D
wAiT vIrGIls EyeShaDOwS pURPle! Ahhhhhhhhh!
EKSIYEHKEUVEJSUGWNEISYVENDIBDKWUVCENWOYEVDJDIGWHOSUVEKDUGWJSIDHHWBEIYDBDKIGEBJDIHEBEJDUHWKSJ- I CAN'T  IT'S TOO CUTE
While I would love to watch this now the second hand embarrassment and anxiety is already killing me
YESSSSS TWO SHIPS IN ONE VIDEO!!
VIRGILS. PASTEL PURPLE. EYESHADOW.  I DIDNT THINK I COULD LOVE HIM MORE AND YET-  HERE WE ARE
This was one of my favorite sander sides episode, so good!! Props to the artists, this also LOOKS so good! 🥺
Thomas: *knocks over trashcan* Virgil: JWBAISKJSNWKAJDA Roman: !?!?!??!?!? INNNNNNNNNN!!???????!!!!!! Our lovely Thomas, in his infinite wisdom: !!!!! ⊙﹏⊙ *Hops in*
*excessive clapping* MORE CLUES  "An XXXpert" Me: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
23:11 23:18 23:22 VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGES AS HIS EMOTIONS CHANGE
I like how everyone here is picking at the jokes but left the serious part out because they know they gonna analyze everything he said if they just had the time!!        But like.... Same
OMG I love Virgil's purple eye shadow! It's so cute 😍
"Flirting with Anxiety" Thomas do you know you are killing your fans, one little heart attack at a time
Thomas: *talking to himself in the bathroom* Me: someone's gonna pop out, someone's gonna pop out, someone's gonna pop out, someone's gonna pop out, someone's gonna-
*VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW I CAN’T*
I really missed you🥺💗
Me at the and of the amimation: "JUST KISS ALREADY!"
WHEN HES EXCITED OR HAPPY HE HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW!!!!!!!!
I could definitely relate to the situation Thomas is in( in the Animatic). I've seen a person that I found attractive, but no knowing what to talk about, or even how to talk to him/her/them. Nowadays I've definitely have gotten better with social situations. Seeing this is like seeing myself, a younger version of myself. Despite the Awkward situation Thomas is in, Its kind of funny.
Why is nobody talking about how Virgil’s eyeshadow became purple when he was happy?
PRINXIETY
Love the happy eye shadow virgil
Did anyone else notice that virgil had purple eye shadow under his eyes then changed to black but the purple eyes shadow was adorable
IM IN LOVE WITH VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGING
do you hear that?      *that's the sound of prinxiety shippers' crying*
22:35 and 22:59 Anyone else nodice that virgil's eyeshadow was purple but then after Thomas read his tweet that he tweeted about his day it turned back into its normal color (black)?! Is this a bloop or does his eyeshadow change color depending on his mood?? Does it just change color??? (Also this eps gave off HUGE prinxiety vibes and I'm a prinxiety shipper so this might be my favorite episode yet)
gosh this was splendid
Roman, Thomas and Virgil: *sees nightmare before christmas sticker* OH MY GOD  I'm sorry but I love that LMAO
virgil's eyeshadow changing
I just about cried that was the best thing I ever seen
The entire video is basicly Thomas having a “gay panic” and I’m all for it 👌
SOMETIMES VIRGIL IS SPARKLY !!!!
I would love to join but i can't I also have a lot of writing ideas because I write poetry also your videos help me with my hard times aslo I feel like and outcast and I want to thank you for helping me with my feeling though your videos also I just did something out of my comfort zone to gain confidence and they're a lot of  stereotypes with the hairstyle I did but I just wanted to thank you again for helping me through your videos
VIRG’S MAKEUP
Ahh that was so cute I loved it!!! Roman and virgil is the best duo, I also love Virgil's eye shadow how it changed But the way Roman said "oh shut up emo" at the end ... I love it!!
my prinxiety heart is thriving (also Virgil has purple eyeshadow when he's super happy and I love that sm)
Virgil's eyeshadow was changing we know when he's excited nowwww!!
I love it! Thomas and the team outdid themselves, again Its amazing. It's art. It's the bets love story. Thank you for the serotonin
I really liked when Virgil's eye-shadow went back and forth from purple to black! It was a nice touch :D
Why is my broke self actually tempted to join Janus's patreon?!
you know who should play the friend at 11:10?  Jacksepticeye
When Roman placed his hand on v's shoulder I just said " pRiNxIeTy?!?! "
Me the whole time: *intense screaming*
Roman: "Yeah, join me, no thinking!!"  Roman really said himbo energy
Why is Virgil's eyeshadow,,, PURPLE??
VIRGILS EYESHADOW KEEKAAKDDKDKEJFJFKSKK
Ok is it just me or did anyone else notice Virgil’s eye shadow changing colors with his emotions?? Purple when he was excited and back to black when he was nervous
Omg I loved the way Virgil’s makeup changes at the end, with how whenever he got happy the makeup turned purple with a little bit of glitter, and whenever Thomas started to question stuff it turned back to solid black!! 🥰
Also-      Did anyone notice Virgil’s purple eyeshadow!?!! It’s so cute and I just ahhh!!! 💜💜💜
The detail of virgil's makeup is SO good
OH MY G O S H VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW HFJSHCJAJDJAJJFJSJFJAJJRJSJVJWJ
the animation was so good, it would be fucking amazing if there would be videos like this in the future, too!!
15:18  Janus depreciation gang
Thanks Thomathy, Joan, Quil and everyone else for making this 💛💛 It’s made my day
Did y’all notice virgils eyeshadow changed from like a lavender to a black?? Is that just me???
VIRGIL CAME BACK
Virgil with purple glittery eyeshadow is my religion
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW?!?! ok ok So im assuming its representative of how he feels, it only turned back to its original black when something worrying happened, otherwise it was purple and sparkly. Perhaps showing his true transition to being a light side? Mm? Who knows. If people wanna theorize with me under this comment that would be ✨great✨
Am I the only one that noticed Virgil's eyeshadow changing from purple to black whenever he got anxious again?! The new eyeshadow looks great btw😍😊💕
give me a second to scream about all the things. Thomas getting a boyfriend? LOVE IT!!! Virgil's eyeshadow? AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!! Just ALL the things!!!!!! I love it all!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
The king is back everyone.
The purple eyeshadow tho like omggg, I'm literally screaming
OH MY HECK
I love how like every ship in this fandom has its own moments (not including * gag* remron..)

⚠️SPOILERS⚠️ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW?!
I actually screeched with the Sanders Sides at the end. I guess I'm just happy that Thomas finally- I mean, this video melted my whole heart, I'm so, I feel so happy for him! It's amazing!
Virgil's makeup change when he is happy. When he is upset and it turns black but when he is happy it's bright purple. Love that.

OMG I LOVE THIS EPISODE SO MUCH! IT'S SO CUTE! PRINXIETY! OMG! I DIDN'T SHIP PRINXIETY BEFORE BUT I SHIP IT NOW I'M IN LOVE WITH THE ANIMATIC!       btw, I think its SO CUTE that Virgil's eye shadow changes depending on how he is feeling! It's so cuuuuuuuuute!
*cough* Anyway, brilliant episode! Great job all you artists who contributed!! It looks amazing! And Patreon is a good idea! I must confess I’m a little skeptical about fans contributing to the writing even myself, but I trust yall, so have at it :D  thank you for taking time to make this episode amazing :D
YEEEEEWEWEEEEEEEREEEEEEESSSS
Did anyone else notice at the end of the video virgil's eyeshadow was changing colors??!! Just me.... ok...
VIRGIL WITH THE PUPPLE EYESHADOW YES PLAESE AND TANK YOU
VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGED FROM PURPLE TO BLACK AS HE GOT MORE ANXIOUS OMG I'M CRYING!!!!!
thomas: “nothing but a bruised ego”  roman: *angry villager noises*
PURPLE???? PURPLE MAKEUP??!?!?!?!?!?!? AHHHHHHH
HE'S BACCCCCCCKKKKKK! 😁😁 AHGHGHHGGGG! I AM SQUEELING.
UHHHH CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WHEN VIRGIL GOT HAPPY HIS EYESHADOW CHANGED TO PURPLE!?!
OMG THAT WAS SO CUUTTTEEE MY HEEEAAARRRRRRRTTTTT
Another awesome video Thomas! Did anyone else notice that Virgil's eyeshadow kept changing from purple to black during the end card?? Idk why that interested me so much. Also! VIRGIL LOOKING HAPPY!!!😁😁😁He is a bean💜🖤
*ASKSJSVDGABLOJJSH*
Legit BOLTED to my room to grab my laptop to join the $25 tier :D
1.) This is a great episode 2.) Second hand embarrassment was real. This is too relatable
This is one of my favourite sanders sides videos! ❤❤❤ Also........ Is prinxiety canon? I need to know. And are there any other canon ships?
I love how they all acted all chill and once they get home... Fan girling
so if Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he's happy/excited- and that's never happened before- does that mean that he's literally never been happy/excited until this episode?? because I'm crying in the club rn at that
Okay, but did anyone notice how Virgil's eyeshadow near the end kept going from a purple to black? Might just be me but I'm curious if that was  intentional.
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa I LOVED IT!!!!!!!! thank you for continuing to make our lives better. The sanders sides series means so much to me. i don't think i would have become half the person i am if it wasn't for you and your friends' work. not to mention it led me down the road of realising im ace/aro. thank you so much for all the work you and your team put in!!!! 💖🧡💛💚💙💜💙💚💛🧡💖
Why is no one talking about how Virgils eyeshadow keeps CHANGING AHHHHHHH
VIRGILS EYESHADOW IS PORPLE WJEN HE GETS EXCITED REEEEEEEE
Hi Thomas I live your vids theyre good quality👌
oh my gosh peck! I loved this ep ;3
Virgils sparkly makeup turning black when Thomas did something embarrassing at the end is amazing.
that beginning montage of social blunders was so me it hurts
It's like cyberstalking, but in real life-Virgil So..stalking- Roman YOUR RIGHT!!- Virgil I'm wheezing
I WANT TO CRYYYYY THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!
WHAT IS UP WITH VIRGIL'S NEW MAKEUP?!?!?
Virgils eye makeup at the end tho!!
THE EYESHADOW CHANGES?!?!? WHEN HE’S EXCITED !!!!!!!
Why is no one talking about Virgil's purple eyeshadow?!!?!
WHY IS NO ONE BRINGING UP VIRGILS EYESHADOW  IT TURNS SPARKLY AND PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY OMGGGGGG IM CRYING
I needed this i mean it sanders if you dare not post for over a month again I will die
Also, did anyone else notice the Lowkey purple eyeshadow when Virgil got happy? I’m soft 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
VIRGILS MAKEUP IS PURPLE!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! SO CUTE!!!!
DUDE WHEN VIRGIL IS HAPPY AND/OR BLUSHING HIS EYESHADOW GLOWS PURPLE THATS THE CUTEST LITTLE DETAIL AHHHH
Anyone notice Virgil's eyeshadow was bright purple
16:39 *Thomas you gay sausage what're you doing*
HAHAHA GERALD GAY
Am I the only who realize Virgil under eye bag/shade changed? When the first came in the house it was purple with a hint of glow to it but after Thomas asked “if he ready for this “ and he said to think about it they turn back to his normal black. Also when yelled “demon” to the dog barking it did that echo thing it did when went to Patton room and everyone started to get caught in the pass...... yo theories part of the fandom check into this
VIRGIL HAS PURPLE EYESHADOW OMGGGG
it's intriguing how when Virgil is happy, his eye shadow goes purple...so many mysterious questions to have solved
nico x thomas otp
are yall seeing what im seeing rn
1. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 2. I joined the Sanders Sides fandom a week ago which was great timing on my part. 3. PRINXIETYYYY 4. I cried during this episode. 5. Virgil's eyeshadow was purple for a bit and it seemed to be purple when he was happy and black when he was anxious and I adore the detail in the entire series it's amazing. 6. Everyone's already noted it but the part with Roman saying that if he makes a mistake he'll add it to the list. It could either be Roman feeling guilty about making mistakes, or Roman feeling okay about making mistakes and acknowledging that the only lasting consequence is that he made a mistake. I dunno if that makes sense. Knowing Roman and what went down in the last episode, it's probably the former.  7. The bit about Deceit tied in so well with the last episode and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Edit:  8. "I hate to rain on your black parade, Gerard Gay."
Why is nobody talking about Virgils eyeshadow
Next project confirming prinxiety
NOOOOOOO IM BROOOOOOKKKKKEEEEEEE
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT 19:47 MY PRINXIETY HEART IS DIEING I CANTTT    my life is complete now
The Nicki Minaj fan moment made me laugh so hard I was NOT expecting that.
“Great going, Captain Blunderpants!” Did... Did you just reference what I think you just referenced, Thomas? 🤩
Not that I mind these two being on their own once in a while, but what happened to Patton and Logan? 😶🤨
I love this video ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
AHHHHHHHHH HIS EYEShADOW ChANGED WITH HIS MOOD!!!!! Is this showing that he's truly turning into a light side?????!!!?!?!?!?!?!
Okay but THE EYESHADOW. I may very well cry.
I just flipped out so much!!! But what was with the end? What was with this Roman and Virgil scene at the end? Did I saw hearts in the illustration? Can I hope for some ships? But anyway, what was with the light purple eye shadow?  Is this there every time Virgil experiences exiting/in-love moments? Because this looked so adorable, I wanna see more of it now!  Hope y'all keep up with the good ideas, cause this episode was adorable, exiting, emotionally killing me and I had to scream (in a good way of course and hopefully nobody heard it...)
WAIT IS VIRGIL'S OTHER ASPECT EXCITEMENT??????? BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHTENED EMOTIONS???? AND THE PURPLE EYE SHADOW??? AND THE NEEDING TO PEE???? EXACTLY VIRGIL EXACTLY U DESERVE THE WORLDDDDD
19:57 PRINXIETY ALERT EVERYONE.
So is no one going to talk about how Virgil's Eyeshadow by the end of the video??? IT'S PURPLE AND SPARKLING And then it changes time to time to purple and black :D

My clock just ticked over to midnight, so happy national coming out day! What an appropriate video for it! That's enough emotional rollercoastering for the evening though, and Virgil's alternating eyeshadow at the end was giving me whiplash (glad he has a happy colour though), so I'm going to bed.
AAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE THIS
"will deceit be the answers to all of your problems, is that fair to him?" Deceit:I already have to deal with remus I do not have the time.  Me:awhhhh virgil cares
I'm shook af😍
Is no one talking about the light purple eyeshadow underneath Virgil's eyes when he gets excited and then the black when he gets anxious again? Its so cute and I love it!
Wait, when Virgil is feeling confident, his EYESHADOW CHANGES COLOR!!!! Holy crap, so this is the first time he’s felt confident, and ROMAN INFLUENCED IT!
I WAS NOT READY FOR THE EYESHADOW HOLY CRAP

Are we not going to talk about how Virgil pushed Thomas because he saw how sad Roman was? They were on fire this episode
My own social anxiety spiked at this and I kept covering my own face like I’m the one in this scenario. I also knew that someone was totally gonna be in the bathroom, I always think of the word things.

I can just imagine Logan and Patton standing in the background like  Logan: Shall we assist with this dilemma? Patton: No let them handle this Logan: That is a preposterous idea, why are you proposing such an idea? Patton: the heart wants what it wants Logan: *sighs loudly*
Also pointing out that when Virgil was excited his eyeshadow turned purple!!!

YESSSSS :D
Am I the only one who read the title as “Flirting WITH Social Anxiety” 😂
I wish I could be a patreon but I don't have money🥲
Dude thank youuu I have been having a horrible week so YAYYYY!!
Aaaaaaahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
PURPLE EYESHADOW ON VIRGE???? YES
THIS WAS TOO CUTE I’M LITERALLY SQUEALING AHHHHHHHH
Virgil’s eyeshadow changed to purple because he was happy!! :D OUR CHILD  IS HAPPY SOUND THE ALARM PEOPLE
I love Virgil makeup
OHMYGODHISEYESHADOW
Everyone saw Virgil’s eyeshadow change right?!?
Anyone else notice the purple eyeshadow or was it just me?? I love it!  Edit: I just noticed that once he got anxious again, it went back to black!! When Thomas brought up the subtweet, Virgil got anxious again! The pure happiness went away and he gained some anxiety back. Thus, the colorful, happy purple eyeshadow went away. We’ve already established that it gets darker when he’s more anxious, DWIT, so maybe it goes away, or gets really light, when he’s not anxious. Maybe his eyeshadow is actually a really really dark purple. Not black. 🤔 Another edit: when he kept getting happy, or excited, the purple kept coming back! Our purple bean is happy!!
THE PURPLE EYESHADOW YES BABY VIRGIL DESERVES THE WORLDDDDD
IM SOBBING LITERALLY
Thoughts: Towards the beginning of the (actual) episode, you can see Roman acting a little like Virge with the whole yelling and accusing him for things that typically Virge would accuse him for. I think it's because hes been hanging out with Virge more and more because of Patton and Logan siding with Janus in the last video.
This was so gay it hurts. Im so proud if thomas
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO CUTE
THE EYESHADOW WITH THE EMOTIONS IM JUMPING SCREAMING

prinxiety shippers on their way to dominate the w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ video:           👑           😎   ✌     |     🏳️‍🌈        \   |   /             |           /  \         /      \        👠     👠
Oml. Virgil with the changing eyeshadow is just. YES. YES. YES.
A Roman and Virgil episode? YES PLEASE
As someone who is pan and experience social anxiety this hit really hard Thomas as always thanks for being there 🙂
The prinxiety THO IM SCREAMING
"AH!DEMON!" One of my favorite Virgil quotes.  Edit- also, who else noticed that Virgil's eye-shadow was more purple than black in the end?
Oh my gosh I- ahhhhhh!!!! Well I have a new favorite episode now. Also I related to this way too much, heh.
this. I needed this today. im so glad yall are able to keep making content. we missed you
Honestly virgil at the end💘 I love him, I loved the purple eye shadow, I love when he got scared by the dog and said "AH DEMON", and when he said "don't tell me to relax!", I FREAKING LOVE WHEN HE'S SO HAPPY IT'S SO ADORABLE AHHHHHH. And when virgil screemed when the live action version came on!! Omg my heart is melting I can't even think right now I have to watch this episode again!!!!
VIRGILS HAPPY EYESHADOW IS SO CUTE!!!💜💜💜
Can we give some appreciation to Virgil’s purple eyeshadow
Wait Virgil had purple Eyeshadow or are my eyes playing tricks on me? Then it changed back to the normal eyeshadow?
The "guys, gals, and nonbinary pals" hits different now that I'm actually nonbinary
IM SCREAMING
I feel like roman and virgil became closer because they are upset over janus.
THE PRINXIETY SHIPPERS AND WILDING
Roman x Virgil :o ship ship ship
i,,,i be crying and ahhhhh,,, virgil defending deciet,,, and ahhh i love the video
Thomas called me out in this video and I did not ask to be put on blast.
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is ahhhhhhh!
the prinxiety shippers are having a great day
Ommggggg!! Omgggg- this was awesome! Wait- dose this mean Thomas is seeing someone?  Wait- wait this is just gold-   *GOLD*
I'm dying right now at how good it is I can now tell why it took so long
I think I’m crying 😂     It was beautiful! I imagine Patton in the background squealing
I’m not crying you are!!
Virgil: you're making a mistake Me, quietly: goodnight. what are you waiting for? what do you-
Awe, I loved this             VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW TURNS PURPLE!!!!
I already left a comment but that was before i watched the video.. OMG THIS VIDEO WAS SO AMAZING! YESSSSSSS!  Also anyone notice Virgil’s eyeshadow change at the end? Like when he was excited and flustered and what not it was glittery purple then it change back to black. Just thought it was a cute detail!
I couldn't stop smiling at the end 🥺
Sanders Asides >.>
Wait so... who's Janus?
THIS EPISODE WAS SO CUTTEEEEE
Virgil's purple eyeshadow!!
As a movie theater employee who sells the tickets- let me assure you its not that dramatic
i love this fuy
Ay its backk!
the action at the end was just me the second i found out about the next episode, trying not to scream because I was so excited
Thomas: We, we don't even know if he's gay-  Roman: Ah but your ignoring one key thing Thomas. ...We dont know if hes not gay.~  Bro this cracked me up!! X'D
“What are you doing?!”  “I-I don’t know... plant-” 😂 10:44
I saw Alex' icon and immediately cheered for him
When Virgil is happy his eyeshadow turns light purple 🥺
This was so cute and good and really brought me the happiness I wanted wow
OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD! CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE PURPLE EYESHADOW AT THE END PLZ
Anyone notice that Virgil had purple eyeshadow?
EYESHADOW COLOR
Did anyone else notice how when Virgil was happy his eye shadow changed to purple? Or was that just me 😅
This is just 20 minutes of prinxiety
VIRGIL SMILING VIRGIL SMILING VIRGIL SMILING
I just realized Virgil’s under eyeshadow turned a light purple when he wasn’t having as much anxiety!!! That’s so cute and cool!
IM SCREAMING THIS WAS SO CUTE
Right does anyone else notice that Virgil is acting completely different towards the end. E.g has energy, less  of a darker eye shadow this is like a visual adaption of identity disorder it's probably just my ADHD paying to much attention to detail lol or paranoia and anixety were together ( kinda like the creativity twins lol) but instead of being separated they stayed together but both grew into different people. Also just noticed that his eye shadow goes from light to dark and as Virgil's behaviour/mood changes.
I love that Virgil's eyeshadow turns purple when he's blushing. I thought that was rlly cute; also this is prob the happiest I've seen Virgil oh my god
ITS PURPLE!!!!!!!!!
Dang, Thomas making me emotional on main
THIS IS AWESOME I LOVE IT AAAAAAAAA
I cried when Virgil pushed him I- hshakajwhajahahwjsgshiwqk
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
Wait, Virgil had new eyeshadow when he was happy.
*I can hear the Princxiety shippers going absolutely wild.*

OMG MY EMO ALSO this is so awesome I really love this also version with purple eyeshadow amazing also is it when he’s like really excited and actually not anxious holy- God
Virgil's eye shadows look...fabulous
I literally made a pterodactyl screech when I saw prinxiety at the end
So uhhh Roman's type is kinda nerdy... The glasses and the outfit... Also VIRGIL'S MAKEUP CHANGES WHEN THEYRE IN LOVE
“Shut up, emo”   I cried
Why does Nico's voice sound like kevin from wtnv
Y'know if this is important for the storyline  Then  That means the next episode  Will be about relationships Right?
Once I get a job I’m pledging
oh god I think this is my favourite episode of Sanders Sides that I’ve ever seen, my heart just left the fucking building!
My prinxitey heart💖
"shut up emo"  I CHOKEDDDDD!! im not even kidding i nearly choked on meh drink when i heard that.. that was so damn well timed..*cheffs kiss* plus i kinda felt it when he said that-
Virgil’s makeup In the end tho!!! Aaaaah I loved this!!!
This was awesome!
THE PRINXIETY MY HEART CANT TAKE THIS TwT✨
Did someone say PRINXITY
This. Is. Amazing.
I stopped in the middle of a show just to see this immediately.
OH MY GOD VIRGILS EYESHADOW
Virgil has new makeup it’s purple!!
AAAA THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE IT SO MUCH
This entire episode was full of puns and I’m so here for it
Is Virgil's eyeshadow switching between black and purple at the end or are my eyes just weird ?
"hate to rain on your parade, Gerard Gay" pshhhh yEs
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW
Virgil with purple eyeshadow is everything
THE PRINXIETY POWER DUO IS STRONG IN THIS ONE... STAN
i’ve been waiting for this episode for so long and it’s absolutely perfect
PRINXIETY FANS ARE SCREAMING
This was amazing, I’ve been buzzing all day waiting for it, so glad I did, Thomas you are one talented man, your whole personality is beautiful x amazing content as usual x I would be come a Patron but I’ve not got much money and a child on the way x love it all the same x this deffo made my day a million times better x loving the make up on anxiety xx his energy is so catchy x
“Shut up, emo.~”  Awwwwe... my heart!!!
VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW IS EVERYTHING  THE PRINXIETY IS *chefs kiss*  AAAAAAAAAAA
Prinxiety shippers just got a little more canon
Virgil: anaconda  Roman: ANACONDA. THOMAS HES A NIKI MINAJ FAN
I loved this episode so much Edit: i didnt see all of it and i just seen virgil with the purple eyeshadow.🤩
Prinxiety shippers: finally some good fucking food
My friend group and I are all watching this while on video chat.  "Ah, gay eyes" "PRINXIETYYYYYYY" "I connect with virgil on a spirtual level" "Social anxiety go brrrrr" "Mhm. I have wooed many a stranger in a bathroom, as well. I feel you." "YESS!!! YESSS YESS YESSS!!" "Daaayum" " *distant screaming* " "SHUT UP" "I need to use that one- *scribbling noises*"
omg omg that was so freaking good aaaaa
This confirms it. In a past episode where its mentioned that Roman was nervous, I thought that meant he had his own sides. But now I know! Roman, Virgil, Patton and Logan each have their own mini sides. Meaning there is an unlimited amount of "sides"!
Wait- does that mean Thomas got a boyfriend or did they just make this up?
Ahhhhhhhhh! This was too precious!!!!!!!!!!
I had a physical reaction to Joan being the voice of that guy at the start. I love it! Also the lying and Janus being there but not... AMAZING
When Virgil’s happy or not anxious his eyeshadow turns purple?????
They said lies so many times   Janus where are u
Awwww that’s awesome! Love ur work and artists work 💕😂😂😍
virgIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW
This video so far is giving my anxiety but its so worth itttttt
the brAVERY PART OH MY GOODNESS
OMG! This episode was awesome! So cute! Keep it up Thomas!
The gay panic at the end tho-
The one dislike is probably a mistake
THE END WAS SUCH A PRINXIETY MOMENT
Jeez Roman proves time and time again that he knows no old sayings Also agh VIRGILS EYESHADOW
I love Virgil’s eyeshadow change
I LOVED the little detail where Virgil's eyeshadow turned purple when he wasn't as panicked or nervous!
But are we going to talk about Virgil‘s new eyeshadow
HOW DIDNT I GET THE NOTIF??
PURPLE VERGE
I made an alarm to wake up an hour before this. My tablet that I was gonna watch it on froze so I went on my computer. My computer isn't emitting any sound so I had to watch this on my phone.   Now I'm finished with the episode   I'M CRYING OMFG ALL THE PRINXIETY SHIPPERS ARRIVED  FDDFVGBNGJRFDKMVBNGJFDKDMVNBGJFDCBN I CANT BREATHE    OMFG VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW CHANGING IS THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN  THAT LITTLE DETAIL IS MY EVERYTHING
WHATS GOING ON WITH VIRGIL'S EYESHADOW WAIT-??
My assignments can wait 😀✨✨

Do Virgil's undereye bags go bright purple when he's excited?
Virgils new makeup I love it
VIRGILS EYESHADOW OMG
Thomas talking about all the cool stuff on patreon:  Me, a broke kid: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil flustered Virgil
“shut up emo”  STOP IM SOBBING 😭
Interesting Point: Princey and Virgil are totally scared of Thomas lying, does that have anything to do with Janus?  ALSO: Virgil’s eyeshadow changes from purple to black depending on the anxiety he feels!
Roman, hon? Do you need a hug? "If I am [making a mistake] I'll add it to the list"
*Notification Thomas Sanders Posted a Video*       Me:    *YEET*
OMG THAT WAS SO FUN
Me at the end when Roman and Virgil were talking: gay, WAIT GAY, GAY!
*Prinxiety shippers have entered the chat*
I'm not crying you areeeeee
idk this video made me so happy :3
Calling Thomas a liar so much? Interesting, if you think about the last sanderssides video.. especially since it's Roman and Virgil~  Sorta attack Janus in this, aye? Lol
VIRGILS EYELINER AT THE END I LOVE IT
22:54-22:59 oml the eyeshadow change my son no-

OH GOD!! I'VE MISSED THIS !! 🤗💞
Purple Eyeshadow love it
Ahhhh this was posted on my birthday I'm so excited!!!!

I am screaming into my pillow. This is amazing! Also virgils fucking purple eyeshadow!!!!!!!!
Whenever Virgil is feeling gay or in love, he should have the gay eyeshadow-
This is so awkward I'm gonna die!! But I also love it so much!! Conflicting feelings!!! We love that!!! Haha... Anyway
"stop  being fake withe the plastic plans and start being real with him." -Roman Sanders 2020
19:58 THERE ARE LITTERALY HEARTS ANIMATED THEY ARE REALLY FEEDING THE SHIPPERS HUH OMG IM FREAKING OUT
Can you post more
All I wanna do is hug them so hard
VIRGIL HAD PURPLE EYESHADOW FOR A SEC WE ALL SAW THAT RIGHT
"Will deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems? Is that fair to him?" *sigh* "No. No, he's better off without me" Okay. So like, I know this is about the guy in the food court, but I've been watching SS long enough to know that when a side gets brought up by their description, it usually means something. So this has me pulling out my conspiracy board especially considering all the "liar!" Stuff at the beginning
THIS WAS AMAZING AS ALWAYS OH MY GOSH
Thomas: *puts on bowler hat* Me: omg it’s Deciet Thomas: *takes off hat* ya say something Pawton? Me: omg thomas Deciet was just here you missed him
I WANNA JOINN A HHHHHHHHHH BUTT AM. BROOKKEKKEEEE DDDDDDDD:
I can't wait to see the Animation, I love a lot the Animation of any kind especially if it's from someone that do everything without a big company to help them, I prefer similar animations or comics for a lot of reasons that I don't want to say because otherwise the comment lasts too long😂 Last thing I love the continuous presence of Roman and Virgil together. I need to add a little of things about this, I love all the Sides, but I especially love Virgil and Roman and see them working together and see them have a lot of screen time is so beautiful, I will watch this video without ever stopping.
THE PURPLE EYESHADOWWWWW
Omg so epic!!!
VIRGIL I SAW THAT BLUSH!! ////
YASSSSS HE LIVESSSS!! XD
"What are u doing" "Idk plants" That was funny to me for some reason.
Roman: *is sad* Virgil: nope, not letting that happen
This is just a lot of prinxiety
VIRGIL WITH THE OUTFIT CHANGE AND PURPLE EYESHADOW
The way Virgil looks at Roman at 19:59 is adorable and it melt my heart

T-this is beautiful  I cant 😭😭
Honestly, I thought I was seeing things when I got the notification-
This brings a smile on my face :)
Thomas you are amazing
I didn't plan on crying Thomas :"vv
This is so accurate and so perfect and thomas I love you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Prinxiety shippers having a field day with this one lol
"I hate to rain. On your black parade. Gerard Way." >:0000
i missed this
Name a better love story, I'll wait
20:00 the shippers are screaming, and so am I
I love this but I’m also simultaneously getting second hand embarrassment
Aww man I’m so pumped
OMG THAT END SCENE WAS JUST LOVE PRINXIETY FOREVER
I LOVE IT!! ITS SO GOOD!! I cant belive its finally here!!!
HE HAS ARISEN
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
I started crying 😅💜💜💜 This was too cute for my heart to handle
Ahhhhh!!!!! I love this. How can this not be proof of princxiety.
I love you so much 😁😁😁😁😁
I'LL ADD IT TO THE LIST??????
I can totally relate to this
This is the cutest video in the world
ajsvajabsjqbevea im crying-
This is the most adorable ep ever☺️
HOW DO I CRY WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE VIDEOS??
Did anyone noticed that virgil's eye shadow changed to purple when he gets happy?!
This looks like an animatic fan dub but it's made by the original creator and IM LIVING FOR IT
"I hate to rain on your Black Parade, Gerard Gay, but!"
"I've got to stop wooing strangers in the bathroom"  Do you though?
HIIII
I feel bad for saying I ship Thomas and Nico because I feel like Nico is based off a real person but they’re so awkward and cute in this little short LOL
Uy kieto
This video has so much prinxiety
THE PRINXIETY MOMENTS- I'm very into this ship 😂
so uhhhh y'all noticed that Virgil's makeup kept changing at the end right? because personally I'm gonna be overanalyzing that for hours
This is amazing and me. Lol love ya thomas
I came as soon as I heard
Virgil eye shadow at the end kept turning from purple to black based of how anxious he was
THAT WAS SO PRURE OH MY GODDDDDDD
When he said “speak from the heart” I was expecting Patton to pop up.   Also this sooo cute.   Also Virgil’s eyeshadow reflecting his mood.
THE PRINXIETY IS STRONG IN THIS ONE
AHHHHH VIRGIL AND ROMAN TEAMING UP WE LOVE IT
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EARLY
Now double that anxiety and you have me....  ....having a Bi panic💖💜💙 almost every single day!!!
Oh my goodness the art style is so cuteeeeee
WAIT VIRGILS EYESHADOW CHANGES WHEN HIS MOOD CHANGES WISHEIJEE
Update: Damn it dude. Back again with the wonderful monologue.
AAAHHHHHHHHHH IM GOING TO CRY 😭😭😭😭😭❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I’m surprised that Janus didn’t appear with how many times Virgil and Roman confronted him. 😅  Edit: great video, but what you always say, “could be gayer” either way an amazing video as usual! :3  Edit: here’s a weird thought I got from this video, when Virgil said, “Roman I know you love tugging the heart strings” does this technically mean he likes to manipulate Patton? Or did I just want to come up with a weird thought/theory...
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Y E S
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH RJFJEKDJDJGJDISJRJ THE GAY PANIC!
With a post like that, article writers think he's married?
VIRGIL STOOD UP FOR JANUS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. VIRGIL STOOD UP FOR JANUS.  "is that fair to him(deciet)"  Also Virgil doesn't know J's name
I LOVE THE PURPLE UNDER VIRGILS EYES OMG- THE WAY ITS SWITCHING FROM PURPLE TO BLACK OMG I LOVE IT 💛
When they started to talk after thr push I couldn't stop happy laughing
THE SECOND HAND ANXIETY I AM FEELING IS REAL. ALSO THIS IS ✨ADORABLE✨
I'M CRYING RN?????
OUR KING HAS RETURNED
* Prinxiety has entered the chat *
VIRGIL FOR THE WIN!!!
“Shut up emo” *cries in pinxiety fluff*
MY BABY CHILD IS IN LOVE!!!!
I really wish that this whole video is real because Thomas deserves all the happiness
I loved the video and the story behind it. Now I am just going to wish I can scrape up $25 cause I really want the shirt. It's so cool!
I feel like this video perfectly explains gay panic
This was amazing!I loved this!
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I freaking love his laugh, I love everything about him ahhhh >•< one of my two biggest idols in the world I love Thomas so muchhhhhh!!!!
POV: Prinxiety shippers have a field day

Hi
AN ANIMATIC:!&?&;$(@;$,!;!:?:);$;
*insert the office, it’s happening meme*
"top of the morning to ya." Oh gawd. Also, only patrons get to see the "live" video? Not fair!!!!!!
this is as fabulous as always! amazing job to everyone who worked on this! the expressions are amazing, both in the voice and the drawings. i love that virgil's eyeshadow changes with his mood. i love seeing him excited and all of them are just super euphoric and it makes me SO HAPPY!! i love this so much :).
I hate to rain on your black parade gerard gay I cant i actual choked. made me proud tomathy  wAIT- when Roman said shut up emo after virgil started to say he wasnt brave, he looked away all blushy with hearts so like...Roman just enjoying the veiw of Nico or is prinxiety finally sailing!?
Am I the only one who heard the fact virgil cared about Janus and how it's not fair Thomas results to him all the time (or am I dumb and he was talking 1bout the guy not Janus?)
All the prinxity stans are crying tears of joy with the ending
Virgil’s eye makeup!!!!!
Gay panic... Damn if that part isn't a whole mood
I dropped everything for this  And then my friend posted half way through the video and it hurt but I had to ignore the notification just for this  But this was important
There have been TikToks about gay eyes on my for you page. Lol
Thomas' hella awkwardness is such a mood oml-
Poor restroom guy 😪
Hey I may be annoying sometimes, but at least I'm not as annoying as the people that jump right on and dislike.
PINTROVERTS🤣🤣🤣

When Thomas said "top of the mornin to ya" I thought he was going to say "top of the mornin to ya Laddies my name is Thomas sanders/jacksepticeye"
Thomas wtf 😭😭😭😭
Hummm seems like more Prinxiety
10:45 “idk :(( plaaants..”

I'm kind of like Thomas when I see a cute guy my social anxiety goes through the roof
14:12 no you cannot make me cry like that

I Just Know That Patton Is Somewhere in There's being proud
The Return of the King
22:35 OMG! VIRGIL WITH THE PURPLE EYESHADOW(I kinda think he looks better with black, but that might be because I’m used to him wearing black eyeshadow)!
19:55 PRINXIETY RIGHT THERE
WOAHHHHH
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ex ex expert? At least he's still an expert
Got sent here by the artist.
FINALLY!!!!!
Hi so I have a music project where I review a song and I chose rhythm redox,  but we need a photo of the singer, and I wanna ask if I could use one of your pictures! Of course you don't have to say yes, also , have a good day!
.... this video is calling me out way to much while also making me laugh and I don't know how to feel
THIS WAS SO GODDAMN ADORABLE OH MY GOOOOD
I KNEW SOMEONE WAS IN THE BATHROOM OMG 🤣🤣
I haven't seen any comments pointing it out yet so I'll just say it but whenever Virgil's happy, his eyebags turn a lighter color! So cute!!  What a precious bean. 🧡
I have never related more to a sandersides video in a long time... i also fired up my anxiety so... thank you!
This is screaming Prinxiety
13:45 When Thomas finally resolves to talk but there’s still 10 more minutes left
GERARD GAY
So amazing! Wish I had money...... But it’s so cute that when Virgil was happy is purple was blooming! That was adorable
VIRGIL"S BLUSHING A LOT AND I AM LIVING FOR IT
15:00 "yeah i gotta stop wooing strangers in the bathroom" yeah same #relatable
OH NO
Prinxiety canon???
"Hes got some stickers on his laptop"  "Prettyyy gay"  Me, a bisexual with my laptop covered in stickers: 👁💋👁 ,,,,oh,,,,
Seeing the sander sides actually together and touching is omg dreams achieved *insert Roman's Disney vocal solo*
Finalmente, shoremos 🙏😍

AHH, ALEX, IM SO PROUD
okay,  i didn't expect this to be this cute.
“You’re making a mistake- if I am I’ll add it to the list” “Will deceit continue to be the answer” ahhhh Thomas why do you do these things! Seriously though this was amazing and I like how it subtly tied into the last episode
"Did he not flush?" -Roman and Thomas 2020
15:40. Are you talking about Janus, or the consept of deceit?
This has made my day
GERARD GAY. Omg
”5 seconds, Max!” ”What? I'm Prince Roman not-”  ”No, man, I-” ”It's Roman. With a R. Roman. Geez, Virgil, you're really bad today.”  I love this
That got emotional quickly
Prinxiety ship is sailing!!!!
I LOVE VIRGIL’S PURPLE EYESHADOW!!! 💜🖤💜
10:08 I haven't finished the vid yet but this is amazing
why are there so many ads this time???????
I stopped watching Glee to see this....and I'm not disappointed.............   But there is so. much. ANGST.  Also, Prinxiety shippers went 💗💗💗💗💗                               Also THE PURPLE EYESHADOW
I saw flirting with anxiety at fjrst-
The moments all fanders have been waiting for. This is like an early Christmas gift for all of us.
it looks like every single theory about this video was wrong sjdjjsjdjskkf
FINALLY, YES!!!! OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS STUFF SO MUCH!!
I never thought I would see Thomas having a gay panic-  Also I’m starting to ✨cry✨ because I love Thomas
Aaaaah  been waiting solong for this videoooo
this is the best birthday gift hell yeah
THIS IS ADORABLE NVM
We got some great quotes from this episode. "Don't want to rain on your black parade, gerard gay" was probably my favourite though lol
IS NIKO REAL?
Dang Janus is having a field day with this one
Virgil: You did it again.  Thomas: yeah I guess I gotta stop wooing strangers in the bathroom
Prinxiety shippers come get your juice 🥺❤️❤️
roman and virgil as a duo is AMAZING!!! i always knew they'd be chaotic in his best interest
Beautiful
7:25 I don't know why I was so happy to see he was a lakers fan.
*me watching the scene in the bathroom* he's going to come out of the stall behind Thomas isn't he.      *guy pops out of stall behind Thomas* yep.
*n i c e*
“Will deceit continue to be the answer to all of your problems?” I died
:O
MY PRINXIETY HEART    Also, I lived for the blink 182 reference     And I have never related to Virgil more
Gay panic the video
Loves it
I was minding my own business and this come up on my recommended super fast I'm so happy
THAT IS SO CUTE
I read the title in the wrong way. Like flirting to the anxiety.
This makes my lesbian heart very happy
VIRGIL AND ROMAN OMG
Ooh, more creative freedom
Yes I love this
lmao this man literally just said ‘idk...plAnt’
This makes my heart go boom ❤️
This gave me anxiety! XD, also Princiety (Can’t fricken spell) fans where you at!
This is Beautifully animated! It's things like this that inspire me to study animation 😍 great work
Omg I am crying 😫🥺🥺❤️❤️
Me: who has a social anxiety disorder.              "Yes..."
OMG OMG GAY NIKO IS THIS REAL???
This is so cute ! I can’t wait to see in live action !
UAGSHSBGWSHHW THIS IS SO GOOOD ✨✨✨✨✨  good job Thomas you always seem to make me smile 🥺
the prinxiety energy is immaculate
Omg I almost threw my phone like 20 times in this video
*me being extremely extroverted and not relating at all* hmm yes s t i c k e r s
Who else saw Patton in a skirt and was happy?
The end of the animatic was just beautiful
I'm getting secondhand embarrassement from this though i really like it haha!
This was hilarious but then the end just hit you with a wall of sadness. Then you start feeling happy again and this is adorable and great and also did no one notice virgil's eye shadow! It went from sparkling purple to dark black
Ahhhhh tomas this is amzeing
Ahhhhhhhhhh yesssss! I love you so much. You just made my whole existence!😁
WKDNHCNSNC YAS THOMAS
"you're making a mistake!" "if i am i'll add it to the list!"  roman nO-
If I have pins on my backpack, talk to me about them! I like the pins, I’m showing you that I like the pins, tell me you like them too and we can talk!! Also if you’re gay and into me, that’s even better :) we’ll both be awkward messes!
YES
AJAHAHDJXHSHFJEHDEHFHRHDH YES YES YES
I love you
I LOVE IT WHEN ANXIETY GETS ALL HAPPY AND MUSHY
Could be gayer
REEEEEEE
Wait so Thomas has a boyfriend now??
Roman: what are you doing? Thomas: *I uh plant?*
"Will deceit continue to be the answer?" Uhm, you mean Janus?
Hello kiddos I am not Patton but if you need a step in parent...hello! I am your new parent dinner is at 5:00 and if you kill someone or commit arson then go sit in the time out corner with Remus and you can come out in 5 mins and go drink some water love you kiddos!
I hit one of his videos that was suggested to me, but I didn’t realize it was made 16 minuets ago!! What the-
Thomas's social anxiety spoke to me on a spiritual level Also, YeS ThIs ViDeO WaS BeAuTiFuL  Edit: I'm aT ThE eNd Of tHe ViDeO AnD ViRgIlS EyEsHadOw!!!!!
I love the my chemical romance reference  “I hate to rain on your black parade,Gerald Gay”😂😂❤️❤️
The animators did a great job. Loving the animatic style. And I love seeing Roman and Virgil almost on the same page. At the same time poor Thomas being dragged back and forth between the two.  Pins and stickers being a way an introvert shows off their interests without talking. I feel called out 😂 Love this moment: Roman: **tries to be Shakespearean** Thomas: What? Roman: Cutie at 12 o’clock  I love the detail of Virgil's makeup turning purple as he gets excited. My anxiety is now hitting me so I feel like this comment is getting long so I apologize.
I missed the boys!!! I am so happy to see Virgil and Roman again, but I am still sad that Logan and Patton are not here.
This is way too dramatic and I love it 😂
I like how you can see Roman and Virgil in a real life setting outside the house. Xd
14:21 and I’m sobbing :)
Favorite line:   "I hate to rain on you're black parade, Gerad Gay but-"
I LOVE YOU NICO
YAYYYYY ITS OOOUTTTTTTT
Me coming from Alex’s channel: WOOOOO PROUD OF THE BOIIIIIII!!!
20:28  OMG JANUS!
Ok ✅
Me yelling at my iPad: NO! GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER! GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER!!!
omg virgil and roman look so cute!
MARRY HIM
This is uploaded, my bi heart is happy, and my anxiety is still thriving but not as much.
"What are you doing!?" "Idk, plant?" THATS A MOOD
I'm finally early to this.
"If you don't have anything nice to say, *you're a dirty liar*" is going to be my senior quote
Damn, just attacking deceit's livelihood
This gives me hard prinxiety vibes
omg virgil and roman look so cute!
My notifications: New sander sides video! Me: *ultimate happiness noises*
God this is far too relatable
RAIN ON YOUR BLACK PARADE GERARD GAY-
JESUS I LOVE THIS
"You're making a mistake!" "If I am,I'll add it to the list!" Aw,Roman,baby,noooo😭

Our dark strange son has returned
Omg 16 minutes ago!!! Earliest I've ever been  on his channel!
Can we talk about this, please??? Virgil: you're making a mistake Roman: if i am, i'll add it to the list
"You're making a mistake!" "Well if I am, I'll add it to the list!!" ......OUCH
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS of course
Thomas:Those jokes are old Roman: You would know  Me: *crying of laughter*
Prinxiety shippers had fun with this one
I'm sorry, but...Gerard Gay. 😂

YouTube didn't send me a notification :(
THE HAPPIEST I FEEL RIGHT NOW
Roman and Virgil every a while: Liar!  Janus: *offended sneK noises*
OooOoOoOooOoOoOooOo SHIPPPPP
HE'S BACKKKKK
Patton would be so proud of all the puns
16:00 And this children, is what we call, a gay panic
OMG this is amazing. That was so cool. Good job to Everyone Who participated to this
yo how are there already 8 dislikes?
Thomas is a bottom confirmed
so much new content of my BABIES
YAYYYY I NEEDED THIS TOMATHY
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT,  "If I'm making a mistake, I'll add it to the list!"  WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THAT QUOTE?? ROMAN?? ARE YOU ALRIGHT??
i was literally just talking about sanders sides with a friend then *_this_* shows up aaaaaaaa
"He's in his thirties, he might as well be sixty."  That hit close to home. I'm going to go lie on the floor.
Both Thomas and Odd1sout just uploaded - I’ve never been so pleased before for a YT vid.
Virgil’s eyeshadow it was light purple!!
The fact Roman and Virgil agree a few times the vedio is already amazing-  Im so proud ;w;
“I wasn’t testing you...I was panicking”  Mood Virge...mood...                                         *also my Prinxiety shipping heart got way too excited at the title...;-;*
I WOKE UP TO THIS AND I SCREAMED  I CAN ALREADY TELL THIS US GOING TO BE GREAT
"I dunno, plant" FKISJFJSKFKEK ME
i can hear the prinxiety shippers happily screaming because of the title and thumbnail
the only thing I've learned so far is I need to put some effing buttons and pins and stickers on my stuff so people can be aware of my gay-
Ah so that's where Roman + virgil ship comes from
Stimmy!!! Stimmystimmystimmy (sorry that made me start freaking out too lmao)
I felt second-hand anxiety throughout most of this-
VIRGILS EYE SHADOW CHANGES WHEN HES IN LOVE?! HHHHH
Oh my gosh Virgil with purple eyeshadow!
I love this!! It’s so great! Animations, voice acting, and me being called out throughout this video :)
Bonk
pity he isnt a lesbian you could just ask if he listens to girl in red...what’s the guy equivalent of this?
YAY NEW VIDBEO TNANO U THOMAS I CANT EVEN TUPE YAYAYAYA
This would be a great animated tv series
Yoooo this reminds me of the short film In a Heart Beat!
That...was so not worth the wait.
Is thomas actually gay?
WHY DID I JUST GOT THIS NOTIFICATION!?!?
4:15 6:26 end
Hewwo
Fhdndndn. Okay, I'm gonna be honest, this is probably my favorite episode ever.
WE CAN LIVE LIKE JACK AND SALLY IF WE WANTTTTTT
IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP

The prinxiety is strong with this one.
I get an oddonesout notification *and* a Thomas sanders notification! What is this? Christmas??
AAAHHHHHHHHHH
This is way too accurate for my love life
Roman and virgil gave me a married couple vibe certen parts of the vid
The second hand embarrassment I’m getting from this hurts-
Virgil: its like cyber stalking.... but in real life Roman: .....so just stalking? Virgil:... OH YOURE RIGHT-
Cyber stocking but in real life So stocking? OH YOURE RIGHT!
Wow so many likes in so little munits Thomas you got it going keep it up boiii
Roman and Virgil: "LIAR"
;;;
The PrinXiety is overflowing and I am not complaining
*Me casually crying because it wouldn’t let me watch the video for 3 minutes after it was released*
i love thomas but i am DYING over the fact that ABDIllustrates worked on this!!! im such a big fan of them and seeing them collabing with thomas sanders is just perfection!!!!!

When virgil said deciet, I expect janus to pop up
This aside episode is almost as long as the first 4 normal episodes together 😂 😂
Roman: "I hate to rain on your black parade."  Me: haha nice one buddy!
..."thats like Cyber stalker...but real life.."  "...sooo...stalking?.."  "OH YOU'RE RIGHT"
”soo... Stalking”  ”OH YOURE RIGHT!”  That's my favorite line in the series now
Virgil and Roman are two halves of a whole idiot
hell yeah BOOOIIII
These drawings are just- MWAH👌
Half way done with this and I'm getting cringe help
idk what it is about roman and virgil calling thomas variations of 'old' but i lost my whole gd mind about it lmao!! this was another great one, and the art is amazing!!
*14:13*  The flaming homosexual shines within you Thomas, you GOT THIS!
Roman: your gonna have to try speaking from the heart Patton: you rang?
Janus is my favorite side :D
Their Lies LoEs LIes lIES lIEeeEeeSssss!
The 9 dislikes are inhuman
This is so cute
Roman was doing the gay eyes!!,!  Uwu
virgil: it’s like cyberstalking but real life roman: so... stalking  virgil: 🤯 you’re right
THE ANIMATION IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT I LOVE IT
This is why if you use the pin system. You also bring your pins. You look back and forth between gay pins.
Called TF out. On all levels xD
Omg I love this. Want a live action too.
10:43 now thats comedy
Video: 'Flirting with social anxiety' Me: Pffft-     For those who don't get it, at first, I thought this video is gonna be Roman just flirting with Virgil😅😅😅.
virgil: you’re making a mistake  roman: if i am, i’ll add it to the list        *if that’s not me idk what is*  edit: IM A PRINXIETY FAN AND I AM SLEEPING WELL TONIGHT I REPEAT I WILL BE SLEEPING SO WELL TONIGHT edit 2: HAPPY VIRGIL AND VIRGIL WITH PURPLE EYESHADOW MAKES ME SO FUCKING HAPPY AHHHHHHHHHHH edit again cause i have too many emotions: this episode made me SO FUCKING HAPPY AHHHHHHHH I LOVE THOMAS I LOVE ROMAN I LOVE VIRGIL AND OH MY GOD I LOVE NICO

“What are you doing?” “I don’t know. Plant” -My brain everytime I get distracted by a plant
"What are you doing?"  "Iunno plant?" Thats a mood honestly 😂 plants are great

As an agoraphobic socially anxious lesbian it's like me but opposite gender
7:23 I spy with my little eye a fellow Yugioh fan. Yes boy!
Pov: You're getting too much second hand embarrassment so you decide to scroll through the comments.
WOO!
Damn this is the best thing to see after waking up.
When I saw the title I panicked I was like *ship or no*
Me waiting for the new sander side video for the whole day Refreshes new video 12 minutes ago Me: SCREAMS
Petition to make "Pintrovert" a thing
Why is the animation so satisfying omgggg
Hey Thomas! I know you probably might not see this but I just wanted to say thank you.   You guys obviously put so much work into each episode you do and the love that goes into each one really shines through. I know that 2020 has been a really rough year for everyone and that it's been pretty scary. Everyone's own Anxiety has probably been freaking out in their own Mind Palace more frequently than ever. However, this video and you are probably some of the biggest bright spots in such a gloomy year. So I figured I'd take the time and use my comment to just thank you and your team for all your hard work.  I hope only the best for you, your friends, and your family this year and hopefully, the rest of 2020 won't be so bad. So again, thank you and thank you for being you!
Finally thanks for making a vid
Somehow this is giving me social anxiety
“i hate to rain on your black parade, gerard gay” I SNORTED

Meu pai, me segura que o infarto vem!
Omg Virgil and Roman working together when it comes to romance equals absolute disaster
"I dont want me to be doing this either" is the biggest vibe
!!! ABDIllustrates was part of this!!
"you can live like Jack and Sally if you want" I see the 'I miss you' reference!

AAAAAH HES BACKKKKKKK
I was just about to go to sleep how very dare you peasant
Be me: ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING OUT BECAUSE SOME OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS WORKED ON THIS  EDIT: BE ME, SCREAMING BECAUSE THIS STORY AND ACTING ARE SOOOO GOOD  EDIT EDIT, VIRGIL’S EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HE’S HAPPY, I REPEAT, HIS EYESHADOW GOES PURPLE WHEN HES HAPPY I CANT OMG FJWKODCOAKDJJFEJJWJFKDDJDJWJDICJSKAKFKFJ AHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'm living for Roman's and Virgils friendship
This makes me ship prinxiety even more
GERARD GAY
During the scene at the end Virgil’s eyeshadow turned purple and he seemed     unusually positive, but then that proceeded to change. I’m wondering if this is the opposite of the other sides getting anxious, like when they were in Virgils room, and getting bags under there eyes like him. This could be what happens when Virgil is positive and if there’s nothing at the moment for Thomas to worry about. Random theory though.
Ok so I kinda thought one of the characters was gonna be flirting with anxiety instead of Thomas is flirting with the added challenge of social anxiety.... I’m terrible lmao
YESSSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER
This is pure *beauty* and I love it!
Here comes the prinxiety shippers 🙄
Im so excited!!!!! Thank you Thomas for making a bad day a lot better ❤️  Edit 1: I'm just screaming at 'jerard gay' 😂 Edit 2: there are so many puns in this
Me: *sees the notification of a new sander video* *clicks with the light of speed*

I can’t believe it’s animated!!! I’m not even done with the video, and it’s amazing!
"flirting with social anxiety" ITS HAPPENING OMG ITS HAPPENING
Me: helo everybody😀😌
Love this!!!! So much!!!!
Huh-?  Cutie at 12 o clock   This made me laugh
me: *thinks of typing a comment* my anxiety: what if- me again: got a idea! *types this comment* me: TwT
Alright, let's see what feels i feel today
I completely gave up on my edit for this and now my edit is um... Messed up but totally worth it
Omg just virge and roman is making me so happy I'm like patton with puppies
AHHH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSSS
This is amazing 😂
I feel like this is me with my social anxiety and how I want to tell the girl I like but can't cause I feel like she won't like me in the same way and also how I have a hard time talking to people.
THIS REALLY CAME OUT THE MOMENT I SAID “WOW IM GOING TO DO MY HOMEWORK” I AM SO UPSET /LH

Gonna flex that I'm early😌
VIRGIL BAAAACK!!!!
I’m already crying and I’m in the part where Thomas explains it
Thomas. Thomas. Thomas. Thomas. THOMAS! Hi!
oh here we go
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG IVE BEEN WAITING!          I need prinxiety T^T
Oh im so happy about the artists they had!! I love all of their styles and channels so it was exciting to see them in the video
That one moment when your Sander Sides phase came back the Previous day:
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Thomas, literally needs to just become a voice actor already! His voice is so rich and soothing! I could just SEE him becoming successful in that field. Not to mention being a voice actor allows you to do SO MANY OTHER THINGS with your time that he would absolutely be able to continue to do Sander Sides/Other YouTube things
A
i love the animation! it’s amazing!
After salt? Excuse me, after garlic.
tHIS IS THE EARLIEST IVE BEEN FOR A VIDEO I CANT WAIT FOR TUMBLR

THE ART STYLES ARE SO INCREDIBLY CUTE! I ALREADY LOVE THIS!
