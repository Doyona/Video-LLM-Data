Season 2 was boring and just unwatchable. Woke garbage.
"That's not lemonade!"
What is wrong with you people at Paramount that you have to destroy every last vestige of Star Trek. You are nothing but vandals piliging the names and faces but twisting them into an unrecognizable demented parody of way they were prior to your anti-Midasian treatment.
Let's see you live that long
It's Star Trek senior citizen
Matlock with VFX Trek She Wrote Diagnosis Trek Star Trek: The Former Generation   Sorry but after the dumb, dumb, dumb writing in P2, I'm not going to even bother.  This minute is all I'll give them.  At least the actors look pretty noble as seniors.
Wow i need to buy a tv now 😀😊☺
BEVERLY IS HERE!!! FINALLY!!!
Hope they don’t “Woke” it all up. But I’m sure they will.
The day we lose Sir Patrick Stewart will be the day many of us lose hope. Let us pray that day doesnt happen any time soon
Will the USS Enterprise E return?
I hope this is good. Season 2 was horrendously bad.
Did they seriously cut a trailer together of them posing for what’s clearly for their poster shots?
Can't wait to see the all new Enterprise Ship !!
STNG with my sons all time favorite show and I know he'll be watching it from heaven and sitting with me watching some of the old gang get back together and help the car get out of his pickle 😄
Killed off Data too soon, numbnuts.
Data?
Much of the season 1 & 2 cast won't be returning because the fandom demanded this reunion. Now they have it, I bet they'll 💩 all over this as well. Sigh 🙄
Deep since 9 is not enough. I've seen humans and aliens procreate on many forms of star trek. I wanna see two future black people procreate!
Now where is a black child shown born in the future of star trek. So if you really want to represent us in the future through your current shows. Then do it!! Now and not in the future.
If Wesley is not in this I will be sad
I would like to see a cameo by Susan Gibney..
Patrick Stewart is a criminal and should be apprehended if Paramount cares about its business. WASASA
I'm late to this party! Can't WAIT to see how they drag the rest of the TNG crew down the toilet! Would be ironic if they actually show someone ON a toilet in this season, since that's never been done in any Star Trek show!
I’m calling it now it’s Picard’s speech to the crew of the Enterprise F.
Wow. Together again.
TNG is still my favorite even though I know the earth is flat now.
Jeez, the years have not been kind to Worf. He looks totally different.
I hope there’s a scene where they’re all playing poker, including Picard.   Data: Would you like to deal, sir?  Picard: Oh, thank you, Mr. Data…You know I use to be quite the card player back in my youth……(looks around the table at his crew)…..I should of done this a long time ago.  Troi: You were always welcome.   Picard: Well then..five card stud..nothing wild…and the sky’s the limit.
There is one man yet missing from the cast. Or should I say, one android. Maybe that will be the plot. Picard III: The Search for Data.
I hope it doesn't have season 2 writers writing it. I quit on episode 4 when I seen how woke garbage it was.
I just hope they don't do what they did in Season 1.  Every episode they killed off someone we loved.  Hugh, Data, Icheb, Maddox, and in a way Picard himself.  It felt like the entire first season was just killing off the  characters from TNG and Voyager.  It made me sad.  It would be worse if in season three they start killing off the original main characters, "just to get them out of the way".
There's some Anonymous person who keeps deleting videos, clicking/unclicking for over 10 years on Google devices. Your videos has been one of them
Paramount needs to reconsider saving the series. Everything decent now a days is canceled or goes off air. This could easily go for 2 more seasons and the fans would love it. :)
I'm hoping for so much here...  I want more cameos.  And I really want Worf to be commanding the newest Enterprise.
Amazing! Star Trek never dies!
This looks awesome. Any chance we'll see some of the crew from DS9? Or is that going to be exclusive to Lower Decks?
Very happy that Klingons regained their warrior looks, and not like big bugs as in Discovery.
Where's Broccoli?
All I am thinking about right now is how Red Letter Media is going to perceive this lol.
Garbage. Why is Rafi in it? She's the worst character ever. And they ruined 7's character. What a waste....
Sorry to ask this. Is 7 of Nine the new Data. I miss Brent Spiner !
Regardless of if the final season is good or bad, I hope it will start off a bunch of new TV shows to go off of.  Some interesting ideas that may be new or already thought of (like I read about them somewhere):  * Worf chronicles- focused on Worf serving on a Klingon ship, shift in perspective from traditional Starfleet to Klingon * DS9 continuation- As nice as it would be to have Odo, Nog, and Sisko in the show, I think there's still potential for the other characters to tell what's happened with the prophets, the gamma quadrant, the mirror universe, etc. And incorporating VOY and TNG cast would be even better (plus Bashir's actor was already cast in PIC, as Picard's dad) * Foundation of the Romulan Republic. Of course it's only STO canon right now, but a revolutionary series about the struggles of the Romulan peoples who want to be independent of the Romulan Empire, reforming unity with Vulcans and newfound trust with the Remans, could be a good show (especially along the lines of the Halo show or the DIS style of plots) * Something that shows the flaws of Starfleet and the Federation, ideally right before the burn. It's said that Starfleet was quite extensive before all the ships blew up, well perhaps the Federation had expanded too much, gone into corruption, lost trust in some of its members, and Starfleet has to face the fallout of that, especially with Romulan, Klingon, Cardassian, and gamma and delta quadrant tensions * A miniseries or full show on Enterprise C. Based off Yesterday's Enterprise that ship had the hardest time of any Enterprise crew. Maybe a show showing the struggles of the lost Enterprise crew against cardassians and romulans could be cool
No cameo from Admiral Harry Kim? ;) This is gonna be TNG fans wet dream come true.
Star Trek has come fill circle in it greatness from the original series cast and now to the next generation cast seeing these wonderful and beautiful people play these beloved characters is truly a privilege.
I love the TNG series and crew. They opened up my curiosity about space when I was a kid and ushered me into the world of Star Trek.
Frakes looks like he's lost a lot of weight for this. He was a bit heavy in S1. Dorn, McFadden, and Burton all look great. I'm hoping it's interesting.
they canceled it?....3 seasons only? what a waste
Did y’all forget that they made Picard into an android? What a sick joke.
I guess I’ll have to watch season 2 now
I can’t wait for this show to ruin the rest of the TNG cast too!
And then Miles O'Brien walks out of the darkness and says: "A lightbulb burned out back there. I'll fix it."
A couple of them have had an alarming amount of work done
Remember when Picard died and they made Picard into a synthetic android?  And then androids became slaves and Picard could give two craps about?  It’s as if the writers never saw Measure of a Man.  🤦🏻‍♂️🤔
Is it weird that I want someone to disagree with Picard by telling him, to his face, "You sir, are no Captain Sisko"?
We're getting the band back together.
Is it just me or did it seem like the Black woman so wanted to say its so hard to be a black person in this universe? and then the Counselors line someone definately trying to make some points here
Shouldn't Star Fleet be getting that message from "Where no man has gone before?" by now?
Well looks like WORF got four pips on that collar...  He's going to be a helluva Captain today!
WORF!!!!
Wow ! All my favor characters in Star Treks are back !!! Yeah, I am a sucker for the Next Generation 🙂
Is Geordi an Admiral?  He didn't have Captain's pips but one single pip in a trapezoid?
You know how badly he did not want to do this he did not want to at all and hang out with the old cast
I love the cast.  And  I hope the writing will as amazing as they are.
I would love to see just a little bit of DS9 and Voyager characters in Picard.  Obviously main character like Kira Nerys and Harry Kim would be great, but they don't even need to be the main characters.  Perhaps Molly O'Brien or Naomi Wildman would be just as great.
You keep my hopes up, but I know you’ll let most of us Star Trek fans disappointed! Season one and Two disrespects the character you’re writing for. Stop it, I know for a fact I’m gonna hate it because it’s the same writers, they can’t follow canon, heck they don’t even follow there own canon!
RIP Nichelle Nichols aka Uhura.
This better not be a switch and bate were they are in a episode here or there and then they come in the last episode and help. It better be some real trek and not Pitard trek.
star trek, the elderly voyage
Can't wait!
I'm sure it will end with Picard dying for the final time very heroicly . It would be pretty cool if they could use this season to bring back Sisko and complete the DS9 arc which was a lot better show then TNG.
Season 2 was a disaster in so many ways.  Give me more Strange New Worlds and less Discovery and whatever this sort-of-like-a-Star-Trek series is trying to be.
I hope picard and crusher get together finally
Picard is written like a generic platitude-filled Andrew Yang speech.  Paramount and Viacom are about to completely s*** all over the rest of TNG...  Butterfly tears. All the feels. These show runners are trash
i have zero faith that paramount will honor and respect the TNG legacy characters. look what disney did to the star wars legacy characters. trashed and nerfed them.
As an Asian Jewish Redhead Klingon, I am appalled that this racist show doesn’t have more of my people.
YES WORF!
What!?!  No Wesley.  No Data.  Then no Trek!  LOL
These actors carried the original series further; not only in number of episodes but the first TV series to rerun episodes from the original air date to today and hopefully to enjoy by our grandchildren and great grandchildren. 💖🛸
I miss Data.
Hey! Where is Reginald Barclay!?
Give us Barclay!!!!
wow gates mcfadden is absolutely slaying
Wow my heroes got old.
nothing you showed makes me have to watch your show ... thats the dumbest trailer i ever seen
At least Q will not be there to mess it up.
You were tired of old Trek? So you create New dark Trek, because you want it different. Now you bring back as many old Trek characters as possible. Make up your minds. BTW:  ORVILLE >SNW>PIC+STD+LD+PROD
Without Data, unfortunately.
Welcome back, *T.N.G.* crew! This third and final season of *Star Trek: Picard* will be fantastic. Make it so! Engage! Tea, Earl Grey, decaf, piping hot.
Why is Brent spider not included in season 3
Red Alert! Red Alert!! There has been a major jail break at the Federation Old Folk's Home!!! Be on alert for a group of escaped, retired Has-Beens!!!! They may be coming to a TV screen near you!!!!
LOL they the entire successful cast to support "his" show   what  a joke
Captain Beverly Picard?
This is memberberries, Kurtzman can't write Trek. He actively hates Trek and the fans. He needs to go and someone who actually understands and respects Trek needs to take the helm.
Where’s admiral Janeway?
Good lord, Gates McFadden. Botox much?
Screaming like an 11 yr old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.  But Worf should only be middle aged, klingons live 200 years.  Kang, Kor, and Koloth did.
I really, really hope they stick the landing. The bar was set extremely high with “All Good Things” and in particular the series-ending scene with the poker game. The movies are their own deal, but as far as episodic TV, that’s where we are picking up from. Don’t tarnish it Kurtzman!
I know who I want to see. Those weird alternate dimension aliens who kept kidnapping Riker and who cut off and reattached his arm.
Dottering old fools playing second fiddle to newbies
I want to believe, but there is been to much bad trek in recent memory to watch. 🤦‍♂️
Looking forward to this.
The 90 year old crew will need naps in some of the scenes.
Yes please.  Not ashamed to admit I've got goosebumps.
Gates McFadden turned into Rogue and I fully support it!
Thank god this is the last season.
Pukehard, he's ruined, now they're gonna ruin the rest of the crew. NO thanks!
Seasons 1 & 2 were written just so badly. It was a huge disappointment for a show we WANT to love and enjoy.  Not releasing a full trailer doesn’t reassure the writers have learned from their mistakes from seasons 1 and 2.
Very cool it look like they are bringing back the Star Trek next generation cast in Picard can not wait to see it yes 😎👍
Did I see four pips on Worf!?!
Lol….This trailer looks as awful as season 2 of Picard.
Worf! Worf! Worf!
f p*rn hub .. this is the dirties an*l p*rn ever
THIS is what I have been waiting for, in these episodes!!!!  THIS!!!!
I just wish they could have written a show that didn't rely upon cameos to get people to watch it.  Cameos are more fun and meaningful when they're used sparingly (McCoy, Scotty, Spock in TNG, Sulu in VOY, etc.).  Unfortunately, these writers just seem incapable of coming up with a good story that doesn't rely heavily on fan service.
wow they are reuniting the crew one l;ast time please please put them on the enterprise
YES!!!!!
Star Trek Picard should have 7 seasons just like next generation did period.
Star Trek Picard shouldn’t end with third season. It should have 7 seasons just like next generation did period.
Picard: The Geritol Generation.
Is that Kamala "the Ugandan headhunter" at the 14 second mark?
I wondered, who was older, the original crew during Star Trek 6, or the Next Gen crew during season 3 of Picard?
This crew is my family. Forever.
no data you killed him off or the actor wanted out its not star trek if data isnt there
"Wherever you go, we go" I felt that.
Worf would fight his way through the gates Gre Thor for Picard
All it was missing was Will Wheaton showing up followed by everyone saying "Shut up, Wesley!".
these are the same creators behind season 2. yall just remember that
So sad Data won’t be there.
We need to get one last ride on the Enterprise.
Please stop ruining my childhood
So what character will Brent Spiner be playing this season?
Worf looks amazing
In that entire group only Raffi is a downer. Who created and added this character to Star Trek, seriously?! Get rid of her already!  Creating these kinds of characters should be counted as causing needless harm to this kind of show.
They just need to remember that Worf is the ambassador to Qo'nos for the federation.
Next series, please....  Star Trek: Seven  Yes, with Seven of Nine, but with six more lead cast, including at least three of our favorites. Tuvok? LaForge?  Worf? Kira? EMH? O'Brien? Barclay?
These are the characters who inspired me growing up. They taught me how to love, how to dream, and most importantly how to be a better human.  I cried watching this. STP has brought so much joy into my life, and I cannot wait for this ending to begin!  And can we talk about how amazing it is to see Gates McFadden back as Beverly Crusher?!? She looks so amazing!
So in a nut shell, TNG 2.0
I'm as GIDDY as a little guuuurl!!!
I expect to see Barkley
Why?
YES!!! YES!!! YES!!!
Looks good.
Poor Worf's forehead changed again!
This is going to be epic!
Let the bastardization of beloved characters commence. Good luck to everyone pumped over this new season. Hope it’s great for you.
[Turns to face camera] Yeah, this sure is something to tell me that something is coming, all right.
I experct Nog. Don't let me down.
And I’ve only seen 3 episodes of the first season 🥺
All I ask is a good story and a plot to steer it by.
can't wait
after how terrible the first 2 seasons were, i just don't care anymore.
Ugh, I will have to hate watch this season like the last two I guess.  I can't not know how bad they make this one. I don't fully trust others to completely convey the depths they're taking this series.
No one care.
Please fire Kurtzman and rehire Berman, Moore and Braga. Kurtzman is trashing Trek.
Final season?? NOOOOOOOOO  Hey at least Wesley Crusher was back even if it was towards the very end.   But would have been nice to see Miles O’Brien again!
I like the look of long haired Worf from the TNG finale more.
The only thing is, we will want more than this one season with the Next Generation crew.
RED ALERT!
I don't trust Alex Kurtzman, I wish someone else was in charge on Trek.
This is what Patrick Stewart did not want when he signed on for the series, but it will probably save his show.
I gotta admit...I gave up on this show early in season 2. It just wasn't for me. However, seeing all these actors coming back in their characters really has me excited. I'll give the show another shot.
I love seeing them all again but... the two seasons of Picard we've gotten have been absolute dreck and I do not want to get my hopes up here.
Why do they look so AGED? How many years after Nemesis/Voyager is this?
Now we just need a Star Trek: Sisko.
The other episodes were absolute trash I really hope this performs
I still don't like Rafi. She's is thoroughly unlikeable.
The "USS Dementia" explores the same new worlds that none of them can remember..........
Yes!!! They put the band back together again!!
And now I have a reason to watch the first 2 seasons
wish it was more than just nostalgia though
That is what you call a reunion.
Love Gates
Well, at least yall didn't redesign Worf into one of those dumb looking Klingons in JJ Abrams movies or Discovery. Keep Worf's Klingon style (AND history) across all Trek franchises. They are warriors, not mutated religious zealots flying insectoid style ships. Ugh.
Paramount supports Groomers. Why does Paramount support Child Groomers? Sickos.
I just turned  49  years old  I  was a  Teenager  when  Star  Trek  The  Next  Generation  came  out   on  Syndicated  Television  KBHK  Channel  44  in  the  Bay Area    ,I really  really  tried  not  liking   T N G  because  it  wasn't  the  Original  Cast  Members   ,but  by  the  start  of  Season  2  I  was  absolutely  hooked  b t w   T N G  Season  2  is  still  my  favorite  season  out  of  all  7  Season's  I  can't  wait  for Picard  Season  3  it  should  be  very  Interesting  they  can  Beem  Me  Up  now  I'm  💯  ready  the  return  of  My  favorite  character   W O R F Today  is  a  good  day  to  Die  !  !
Cue the sobbing at seeing the TNG gang back together one last time, looking as beautiful as ever. 😭❤
Since paramount decided to run 3 Star Trek's concurrently, they better make a triple time travel tribble crossover.
Paramount be like:  Hey remember these characters you loved?  Well here they are in short 20 second cameo's before well spend an entire season calling you a racist bigot and stuff
TNG on deck. Exciting stuff!
So excited for the TNG cast, but wish the cast of Picard season 1 and 2 weren't done away with, hope it wasn't dirty to the actors. Really hoping Rafi and Seven are more prominent, and there is more of an ensemble focused arc.
Okay I been waiting for this ,now time to watch this season
Nice! Jordy no visor?? Everyone looks good.
Old man Worf is my new favorite.
OMG! This made my week !
.. let's just hope kurtzman isn't as involved and no more "woke" political propaganda. And don't give me "trek has always been woke"! GR never pushed his ideas down our throats a "one-sided, your opinion doesn't matter and if you don't like what I'm saying I'll get angry or cry"! He allowed his audience to make up our own minds, to have us think, not told what to think. He never labeled us or tried to separate us. It was one ship, one crew no matter your raise or skin color or gender (oops, sorry can't say that word anymore)
I bet Sirtis was greedy AF too
They need to bring back the original writers too.
While never the biggest fan of STTNG (thanks to Berman and Taylor having a death grip on creativity, and constantly crapping on established canon),  has been nothing short of great, and though I look forward to this final season, I also don't want to see it end after only 3. (And, not that anyone else cares, re-watching TNG episodes over the past few years, it holds more appeal for me than it did, no thanks to B/T & Moore.) Yes, please bring in Miles. Hopefully he's advanced out of the enlisted ranks! :^)
Dark, dour, pedestrian dialogue written by greedy corporate shills. The vandalization of The Next Generation and Roddenberry’s vision is complete.
Why is Rafi still around?
Can we get Jeffrey Combs as himself?
So great to see Beverly again. She looks amazing!
Do better paramount, geez. Take notes form Lower Decks and Orville
SWEET!!!
I got chills wow,☺️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💥💥🔥💥🔥🔥🔥💥🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
KEEP KLUTZMAN AWAY FROM THIS SEASON.
Picard is nothing but woke modern day garbage it is so far from Gene Roddenberry’s original vision of the future. 😩👎🏼
more Red Letter Media re:View!
Why does Worf have white hair? Don't Klingons live to be 150 years old?
Let's just not destroy the entire cast in Season 3 like they've done to Picard in Seasons 1 & 2!!
Should have started with this you phking hacks.
I look forward to this final season of Picard.   I wish they would make more episodes per season though.   10 seems so little as complared to 26 in the past.   It's like you get into the story and it is over.  I felt that way with Strange New Worlds.   I wanted more.
The Final season?! You’ve gotta to be kidding me.
Kinda knew this was how they'd wrap up Picard.  First season was great. Second was a filler season while everyone else gets on the Disney Diet for the finale.  Can't wait to see who else they bring back. I want the Rock aka the Pendari Champion.
$100 says the series ends with them passing the Enterprise off to Captain John Harriman IV
For the love of God, remove "Crusher".
This should have been season 1... season 2 at the latest
If Spiner is done being Data for good I don't mind Seven stepping in to fill that void.
Wait where’s Data?
Leave. Leave and never come back.
Love Worf’s look! He’s always been a favorite of mine. I want a spin-off with him as Captain of a starship. It would be amazing if he personally selected the people who weren’t automatically the best but had great potential. He learned so much about himself and how to still be a Klingon in Starfleet through the course of TNG and DS9. It would make sense to see him teach and strengthen those who feel the are too temperamental, damaged or just out of place.
One last ride for TNG...
The real last season in tng
I forget… is Eleanor still dead, or what?
let me guess… Picard and Worf are in love.
Lets just hope that all the characters remain mature and consistent.
Please just stop. You’re ruining it
I can’t stop watching this!!!!
O’Brien and Barkley baby and the baddy turns out to be vger
can we please let this cast go and move forward in the timeline new younger people? Cobra Kai did it right because both get equal time but it doesn't look like the whole show is the old guys re-living their glory days, exactly the same as they were in the 80s/90s and it doesn't look like a retirement home
Too bad we have to wait…
Picard will spend the first three episodes apologizing to Geordi  for his white privilege and Worf will come out as trans.   The final season will be the crew of the Enterprise-D searching the universe for clues on how to define a woman.
High hopes for this. Season 2 was absolutley terrible but because Season 1 was phenomenal, I'm giving this show another shot.
It would be the absolute best if there was a clip of the Galaxy-X being captained by Riker like we saw in "all good thing's." Talk about coming full circle!
Another season to destroy the TNG legacy.
This is going to be absolute trash, just like every other dumpster fire Kurtzman and Co. have paited the Trek logo on these past few years.
Ohhh my god I think I just cheated on my wife…..
Needs more Wesley.
Where's Lt Barkley?  I want answers! Call Dwight Shultz immediately!
I can already hear Mike Stoklasa screaming in agony
"Commander Worfs head looks like a fanny"       -Picard
"A better father"! Please let this mean we get LaVar Burton's daughter, Mica, on the show. Even if it's a cameo, that would be awesome!
I wonder if Geordi ended up with Leah again.
Wesley Crusher please! *At least* a cameo if nothing else.
No Tasha Yar?
My hope is & I am optimistic that somehow the TNG gets their proper send off like the TOS folks got their proper send off 30 years ago.
where is wesley?
I understand why he isn’t there, but boy, do I miss seeing Data…
dear God no.... please don't ruin all of the old characters...
What’s Geordi’s rank?
Where's Janeway?
Worf looks awesome. Show is terrible though
Will I have to watch Season 2 to enjoy this? Heard season 2 was garbage compared to season 1.
So emotional to see these characters again & they have all aged beautifully!
turned ST into woke garbage
GOD THEY ARE SO OLD
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 let it die
Looks like an opening to a sci fi soap opera.
Gates and Jonathan’s quotes are the best.
Who still watches this trash?
🥰 can’t wait for the RLM episode on this!
AARP startrek
This show is so creatively bankrupt it makes Netflix Originals look original.
If Worf can be a part of two Star Trek families/crews then why not Seven? Welcome to the TNG family Seven of Nine!
Ugh, a desperate attempt to get more than a dozen viewers, and will ultimately disappoint.
I cant wait for this show to be over!
I'm so excited for my favorite crew to be back for one final adventure together
Trekkie overload right now!!🤯🤯🤯🖖🏾🖖🏾🖖🏾🖖🏾🖖🏾🖖🏾
WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF! WORF!  HE LOOKS SO GOOD WITH GRAY HAIR! WE LOVE YOU WORF!
Will wheaton
QAPLA'!
I have a bad feeling about this..
this won't mean anything if the season is as bad as season 2
Wish this show (and Paramount+) would act like DS9 & its characters exist...
Want to see Worf command the Enterprise.
They've nailed the look, now they need to get the story right. I'm not a Paramount+ Trek hater but Picard has been the weakest show by far. Please do this reunion justice. It means a lot to so many, myself included.
This is what they should have done in the first place. The only like-able character in this whole thing was Elnor. The legacy characters notwithstanding.
"You're only as good as those around you"? It's read as it's supposed to be inspirational, but that's denigrating and depressing. (remember group projects in school? sheesh!)
Get ready for more garbage.   Strange New World is where its at!!!
Horrible show. Hope its a commercial failure and you stop trying to revive Star Trek, just let it die this time.
I wonder who the female villain is?
Prediction: We see the E, Worf is the captain, but it gets destroyed in the final episode
Trash
Hopefully lieutenant Junior Jae is back as well heh
Lots of Bot-comments here cashing Paramount + paychecks it seems.  Shame, really.  "OMG BEST SHOW EVA"  riiiighht.
I am not expecting Star Trek TNG over again; but more of a fair well. However the Picard series is very lacking. They could had connected the garbage new universe with the prime universe. I don’t know, I view the Kelvin time line as horrendous and not Star Trek
Someone rosomething is causeing Picard to bring the old band back together?  This is going to be epic!!
Oh thank god....  The FINAL season. Hope Discovery ends as well.
Hey,remember them? Remember them?! That's the guy with the head problem! And that's the guy with the eyes problemssss! Remember!?
Everyone is saying no 4 pips on worf, but I see 4 pips lol
Oh Wow!!  Can't wait to see how Worf's life went.  I remember that he was the Federation's  ambassador to the Klingon Empire.
Beverly?!? I thought it was Cher.. Her facial changes will be a distraction when on camera.
Man, seeing this makes me want to see that Captain Worf tv show Michael Dorn kept trying to convince them to make. I bet it would have been awesome, way better than Picard.
Thank the GODs they changed Raffi's hair! Now if they can do something about her horrible character!
Excellent.  I'm looking foward to seeing it.  Bummer that we have to wait until 2023.
Sigh! They all look so adult and dynamic. And, as we saw, Wesley still looks like a goofy kid.
This will be very thrilling to see Seven of Nine be among the rest of the Next Generation cast.
delusional to think this will be anything more than mediocre
Why does it have to be the final season! I will watch every season if they made more! I guess that what Strange New Worlds is here for! Just curious, how does everyone like SNW?
Thank god Worf looks like a real Klingon
No Morn?
AWESOME! I love seeing them all! They look spectacular!
I don't know season 2 left me in a horrible deposition it felt like it was Discovery season 3 all over again. So I expect this to be to the TNG era as Dominion was to Jurassic World. Terrible and irredeemable.
So excited to see all of them back together
There is nothing they can do to undo the first 2 seasons of this ST destroying series.  Patrick should be ashamed of himself.  This is the formula to get people to watch.  Parade some cameos and then make an absolute travesty of a TV show that drives the final nails in the coffin of Star Trek.   Do I want to see Worf as he is in the trailer?  Of course I do and they know that.  They care nothing about the legacy of this once great franchise.  Their first priority is politics, so get ready to get disappointed.  That trailer will be the best episode.
Why does Paramount support molesting little kids?
Worf!
Dr. Crusher look'in like Rogue from X-MEN!.....lol
Old Man Worf ... that right there is worth the price of admission.
Considering how lack luster the stories of Picard seasons 1 & 2 we're and despite this nicely polished teaser, I'm not getting my hopes up for Picard season 3. The only good news is it's coming to a end. Now, give us new DS9 series already!!!
Everyone who is wishing for Worf to be captain of the Enterprise, it seems unlikely as he is wearing yellow instead of command red until the Enterprise has a different classification now.  Completely possible though since Geordi is also in yellow but appears to have the rank of Commodore.  The leather attire could be for away missions or exec level positions for persons not serving on field ships or just different uniforms like we saw between TNG, DS9 and VOY.  Can't wait for this.
I'm just happy Rick Berman is NOT involved. TNG is has Now had 3 farewells... All a good Things, Nemesis, and Now Picard season 3. Perhaps the third times the charm. Now, can we PLEASE next get a reunion/update DS9 series? So awesomeness much was left on the table!
Captain Word Series….PLEASE!
sad that it will be the final season especially since they have only been doing like 10-13 episodes per season instead of like 20-30 episodes that the old shows had for 5-7 seasons. however i have a feeling they might do a "picard" or TNG movie after this. at some point i would really like to see a movie or show based strictly on the borg done with a more horror style. i don't typically care for the horror genre but c'mon they gotta do it with the borg!
When it comes to Star Trek, it all boils down to your fellow shipmates.
Where's Tashia Yar?
Can't wait for this, and for God's sake, throw Wesley Crusher in there for a few minutes with the rest this time.
butterfly tears -RLM
Just stop please.
I can't wait to not watch this but listen to Red Letter Media's commentary on it later.
Yeah. OK. I cried. IDK why.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AWESOME!!! Cannot wait to see the TNG gang together again! My favorite Star Trek series, TNG!!!
Engage!
Nice, season two was a let down for me; hopefully Paramount gets it right this time 🤞
Please make it so that Q shows up  - tells Picard that the movies, the last two seasions - were all an alternate timeline, and none of that happened, rewind it to TNG - have our crew playnig cards, please bring back the way it was. The way it should be. When the writing was good. Oh please! Anyway ... well S2 wasn't as bad as s1 but still... IDK I'm not holding out much hope for this.
Engage!
Looks like poopoo. Used up all your goodwill on 4 awful seasons of discovery and 2 dumpster fire seasons of this show. Pass harder than kidney stones
I feel like this is the equivalent of getting married and she shows you (the preview), and says "I hope your ready, because in 10 months....."
This is like the intro to The Real Housewives of Orange County
No Barclay, no watch.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas, thank you......................nuff' said!
I hope everyone got paid at least.
Oh god, this is gross.
This is a perfect example of how cheap/lazy Hollywood has become. Even one of my folks who used to watch Star Trek all the time on tv & seen the films up to Nemesis in theatres who has stated that Patrick Stewart should just retire. The guys too old to be able to actually do anything other than sit & talk or walk slowly and talk.
Looks like hot garbage.
So glad Wil Wheaton isn’t here to ruin the promo.
I'm going to have to go back and rewatch the first two seasons.  I've already completely forgotten the storyline, at this point.
YESSSSSS!  Love ❤️ 💖 ❣️ this cast!   When does it start?!
Better bring back some real writers for this season as well.   The writing has been so bad!
Glad the visual reboot for the Klingons was backpedaled for Worf.
Looks like Riker is wearing Shatner's old corset.
💞
Why are they all dressed like X-Men? And how much overwrought violence and death will we get in this season? I’m sure you guys can do some reshoots, and add it in there. It makes for great filler, when you can’t otherwise fill the time with smart dialogue.
Season 1: The dumbest thing ever put to film. Season 2: The most boring thing ever put to film. Season 3: What else can you mess up?
What all the thumbs down?  Strange.
Please, please, please don't make it dystopian.  We are living dystopia.  We need hope.  We need something to aspire to.  I was so disappointed by the way the first and second seasons went dystopian.  TNG was one of the few utopian shows that gave us something to wish for and reach for.  Please, give us more of that.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🟥
So happy for this X-Men/Star Trek future crossover... they even have Rogue!! Seriously though, I'm happy about this. The cast looks great!
Well here’s to praying that this season is actually better than the disappointments of 1 and 2.
I'm crying i can't wait to see this
You've already violated Picard, Nu Trek. Guess now it's the rest of TNG's turn to suffer the same cruel fate. SMH
Let's do this!
Just because they brought back our favorite characters doesn't mean it's going to be good I mean look at the past two seasons with the story...... story better be good.
Oh My GAWWWDDDDDDDDD ITS A TNG REUNION OF SORTS
I hope they can also sneak in Data in some way.
I love seeing how Worf finally has the Captains Pins. One question: Why does he have so much grey? For a Klingon who is only 50-60 years old, shouldn't he only have a little grey as Klingons live to be much older than humans. Martok was def older in DS9 but hardly had any grey hair.
I had to watch it twice to recognize Marina Sirtis.
Yay!  More beloved characters for Kurtzman et al. to misunderstand and mangle!
Show still sucks.
Please be better than s2. Pleeeeease don't fumble this Paramount.
OMG…I can’t wait
I also hope they will be on the uss Enterprise NCC-1701-E the whole season if they do I will be happy to get a scription  😁👍👍👍👍
great to see them all, and seven in a starfleet uniform
I don't want to be reminded of season's 1 and 2. Having Raffi back (and maybe even 7of9) was not a good plan.
You mean they didn't make Worf look like a space orc? I'm shocked....
So I guess they're just going to film this thing on site at the nursing home?
If anyone thinks for a second that they're going to do your favorite characters justice, you are either a bot or sadly mistaken.
Yeeeeeeesssss!!  So much nostalgia!!!  So many memories.   I love this.   ❤️
Third times the charm?
I'm pleasantly surprised Worf still looks like a proper klingon
*Is making noises only audible to animal*
It would be amazing to see a de-aged data / B4 return to save everyone at the last minute, and then him take off as captain of the Enterprise-E.   But sadly this series has been nothing but junk from the beginning.. so I doubt that’ll happen.
They should have left Raffi (Ralfie?) behind in the 21st Century where she belongs.  Character sucks, and she doesn't belong on this mission.  I liked her (slightly) better in Season 2, but she's out of place in this reunion.  She'll just eat up valuable screen time for a story arc I don't care about.
Are they all going to be suicidal or addicts now to fit in?
Engage!
Except that’s not Picard. That’s a robot duplicate of Picard. The real Picard died in season 1….or are we supposed to just forget that.
Also Garak just give me a Garak show lol
They got Worf Right, Classic Warrior, a bit aged looking Awesome,!  Jordy a Commodore, Glad he wasn't killed in the Mars attack,.  Riker rocking the Leather as Captain,  Looking forward to this season 3. Rumor, and it,  if this season, hits high enough,  Watch out for a New Series,  With all of them. Even a new B4-Sinth, Datas positronic memory down loaded into a New Sinth Body looking a lot like B4.. Can you say Data Reborn..?
Soo...the final season is doing what the  first season should've done....
OH THANK THE GREAT BIRD OF THE GALAXY WORF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AND ORCLINGON!
Worf looks amazing.. The Leather uniform jacket style is cool!
Yeah, ruin it some more dipshits.
I liked how this show has been about the lives after and/or outside of Starfleet.  I hope Starfleet makes Seven happy, but I'd still like to see a Fenris Rangers show, or something else that's completely outside of Starfleet.  Definitely looking forward to season three, no matter what.
Season 2 was sssoo disappointing, boring, and focused way too much on Picard and his childhood trauma. 🤮  The writers should have focused a little more on Jurati's Borg Queen arrival in 20th century L.A than the 5 or 7 minutes of time.      Well, it's a fitting send-off.  The final voyage of Star Trek The Old Generation.  Don't worry Sir Patrick Stewart was great as Captain/Admiral Picard and looked like Professor Xavier. Don't disappoint like Hollywood normally does in the final season of a show.
Yes! Worf looks like Worf!  👍
TNG:S8 is looking good.   I mean, that’s basically what this is.
The theme came on... and I SMILED!
So Geordi is a father now? Did he end up with Leah Brahms,  or Captain Sonya Gomez of the Archimedes? So help me God,  if he ended up with Worf because men can get pregnant now,  I'm out.
The tingles of joy, reassurance, comfort at learning that Geordi not only became a father, but worked hard at becoming a better one. That's the power of Star Trek and of great storytelling on television.
Please fix season 2 with a great season 3. Season 2 looked good on paper but it was garbage. Total garbage
So who will Brent Spiner be and given that it can’t be Data anymore how will they make it meaningful to see whoever he plays along with the rest of the returning actors.
This looks like an ad for reverse mortgages.
0:44 - Oh God, for the briefest moment, the silhouette worried me that Picard was aging into Shinzon.
Thankfully, Worf not looking like one of those Discovery “Klingons”…
hopefully better than the last 2 seasons... strayed away from what was expected.
Well after the disaster of season 2 let's see if season 3 is worth a s***
Only three thousand likes? Not a good sign for this show.
no klingon redesign for worf? gee almost like the original decision was a mistake.
The teaser clearly shows Worf as a Captain.
But why does Worf look like a Klingon and not an Kling-Orc from Discovery? I thought the reimage of the Klingons was what all the fans liked? Surely Kurtzman couldn't be wrong?
I would love to see one more movie featuring Picard. We want 24th century Trek ❤️
Can't believe this butchering of the franchise still going on.
Still nothing from Discovery S5. Come on paramount plus, Discovery S4 finale aired in March. Picard S2 finale aired in May and we already have a teaser for S3?!? I’m excited for Picard but Discovery is my home. 😔
If the same people are running the show behind the scenes, keep those expectations bottom-of-the-barrel low. Picard has had some of the worst writing in modern sci-fi
Oh good, now they can ruin TNG entirely.
Great to see the band back together :D
aaannd....DATA YAY!!!!!
This gave me goosebumps
“You’re only as good as those around you.” Is Picard throwing shade at his new crew and blaming them for the awfulness of seasons 1 & 2?
Its great to see Worf again and not looking like a Kling-Orc from Lord of the Discovery and I think Michael Dorn may have lost a little weight since Nemesis.
omg Seven looks so incredible in the red command uniform!
Hope it's better than seasons 1 and 2
Too bad Patrick Stewart's voice is in shambles now. It detracts from his command presence.
TNG cast members look great but wow Gates McFadden and LeVar Burton are looking...🔥🔥🔥
Schit's gonna make me cry...
Thank God they didn’t make Worf look like those Klingons on Discovery
Please please please bring back Tracee Cocco as the officer in the background we all know and love… Lt. Jae. I’d make her Captain in a crowd shot somewhere!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 excited screams 😍😍😍😍😍😍 gasp.... more excited screams!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 excited screams 😍😍😍😍😍😍 gasp.... more excited screams!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
🙂👍🏽🖖🏽📽
After the last 2 terrible seasons there is no way you guys will do this right. You guys have ruined star trek.
No Brent Spiner?
When in 2023 is season 3 going to be released?????????? For the love of Rodger Rabbit WHEN ????????????????????????????????????????
This looks amazing!! I’m so happy they got Worf’s makeup right!! I can’t wait!!
Don't get your hopes up.  They are being brought back just to be torn down for woke purposes.
"You are never without hope" : )
In Worf's case, they could have make him look the same as 25 years ago.  It is all prosthetics.
Agreed; Engage!
Still wonder how they gonna pull off Brent Spiner as Data or some other form he says they got the technology to deage him to play Data
Brent!?
My smile grew when I saw Worf
Yes !!!
God please let this be a good season
Wow.  I can't wait.  Did I see Worf w/ 4 pips?  :)
The dialogue in this trailer indicates the writers hold themselves in extremely high regard.
Yay useless platitudes by CW-level writing!
Bringing back the original cast does not hide the violations that Alex Kurtzmann has committed to Star Trek.
I'm always without hope after last seasons garbage writing. As he said, your only as good as the people around you. In this case, only as good as the writers writing the scripts. Not holding my breath that this will be much better then last seasons hot garbage.
All I ask is that Worf mention Jadzia.
Hopefully bringing back the TNG cast redeems the show so far past two seasons been trash.
Why does Worf have white hair? Klingons live a long time and he's not really that old like by Klingon standards. Gray hair makes more sense.
All I want is a Sisko cameo.
So, is the Enterprise 1701-E still flying or is there a new Enterprise?
Mostly excited to see Worf out of the lineup
Not a chance Brent isn't involved
Let’s hope it’s better than season 2, which was by far the worst season of Star Trek since TNG season 1. I’m not holding my breath.
EPIC! Thank you for creating this.
Wow! Everyone looks great!
Oh. I forgot. Mr. Data died in Nemesis.😞
where is data or did i miss him ???
The updates to Worf's makeup are quite impressive - the nose is especially impressive  In DS9 and ESPECIALLY TNG it always looked like a prosthetic - but it looks a lot more textured and like it's REALLY part of his face
Season Two was such a train wreck, hoping Three delivers on the promise this trailer shows.
WE WANT BARCLAY!
The end of the first season and the entire second season were absolute garbage. So they try to bring us back with this? I'll admit that Strange New Worlds was more good than bad, but Picard has been so bad, it's starting to make me hate TNG.
Worf's black baldric is just awesome.
Last chance…
So it looks like Worf is a captain, and somehow Seven is a commander.  Couldn't tell about anyone else (we already know Riker is a captain).
No data?
Worf is as much Star Trek as Spock, IMO.  But rather than giving us nostalgia in moments, just give us what made Star Trek great in the first place.
Worf is looking pretty old for being 60. Koloth was like 150 years old.
It's kurtzman trek so I have no hope after s2 otherwise I'd be massively hyped
Beverly Crusher :)
EPIC.... just      E P I C!
all good things, must come to an end.
O'Brien, Pulaski, and Ro Laren are going to be in it too
It's funny, but after the horrible Klingon redesign in ST:D, I  was truly worried they were going to seriously alter Worf's appearance. I'm very relieved those worries are undone.  The cast looks great.  I watched TNG every week during its original airing & ST:P has fallen short of my expectations in many ways. Seeing these familiar faces is very encouraging.
I see Annika left the Rangers for Starfleet
Interesting....but sick of this version of Picard and Seven of Nine....Seven should not even be in this season...and of course, Data is gonna be CGI....I just hope they do him justice unlike season one....and Q should have been in this season, as well as Guinan. These writers are idiots.
Paramount Plus, just TAKE MY MONEY already!!!
BEVERLY! I hope her character is given the justice / love she deserves but didn't get in the TNG films!
Ooh! Can’t wait!!
Lore is still in a closet.
PICARD 3 GERIATRICS IN SEARCH OF ........WELL?     IT DEPENDS.
For the love of god let some DS9 characters be in this season please!
🖖 💯💯💯💯
It was established that Klingons age like Vulcans so Worf technically shouldn't have Steve Martin hair just yet(he'd only be in his early 60s by this point). However, this is in line with All Good Things so I'll let it slide. Maybe Worf spent much of the last 20 years on a desert world with two suns...
So this is TNG season 8
Yessss!!! This is amazing 👏
Second Star to the Right and Straight on Till Morning.
This will be brilliant... but makes me miss Data even more.  There will be an Android sized hole there :(
Is Worf Captain on the Enterprise E?
Still no Wesley Crusher, LoL 🤣😂
Let's go!!
Why is Worf grey? Hey shouldn't be going grey for another 50 years, at least.
Please be good. Please?
Concerns with how the story will play out aside...hearing and seeing everyone gives me chills!
No Brent Spiner. I hope they have stand in actor for DATA and deep fake Brent's face and voice so it can be a real ageless Android.
We ever going to explain Discovery Klingons? Lol
Did *NOT* expect to see Beverly or Worf.
Can’t wait for the red letter media review
This will do so good, they’ll continue with some sort of spin off. I hope, anyways.
Don't eff it up bro
I have the biggest smile and the warmest wave going through my body. Dude it's so good!
Anyone else already annoyed at the thought that if they end this with all the cast’s signatures coming-up on the screen there’ll be loads of people staying “They ripped that off from Avengers Endgame!” 🙄
This looks like it’ll be fantastic. I can’t wait
Everybody is returning!  Wait a flippin' minute!!!  How is Brent Spiner returning?? How are they going to work him into Season 3 of PICARD???? HMMMMM!
Letsssss gooooo lets boldly goooooooo
She was never my fav character, but I have to say Gates McFadden looks pretty darn good.
I hope there's an episode where they have to sneak into a party with kooky disguises.
Captain Worf!!!! I saw 4 pips!!!
Please don't mess this up like you messed up season 2.
Cool.  Maybe they won't make Picard a dottering fearful old man this season.  More confidence please.
Where's Lt. Broccoli I mean Barclay. Gangs not all back unless Reg is there
So Worf now carries a blade with him wherever he goes? Yeah!
WHEN? WHEN? WHEN? WHEN? WHEN?
Im going to be a crying mess.
Here's an interesting question. Why were most of them armed?
Finally!
I guess no Laris
Give us “Admiral Janeway” and “Worf, house of Mohg “
Yay, the final TNG 10 hour movie
THESE PEOPLE: Are only now understanding how much they are loved and looked up to. 🖖
Finally!  We've been waiting so long for Worf.
If they bring back the Enterprise it's the E. But if they decide to introduce a new one I hope she is just as imposing as her predecessors and not some kit bash abomination.
If there is a battle with a lot of Federation ships, I hope that they use that as an excuse for obvious cameos.    Jake Sisko maybe Captain of the U.S.S. Defiant (yes I know he chose not to enter Starfleet, but because of that what a surprise it would be.)  Harry Kim as Captain of U.S.S. Voyager (maybe with Naomi Wildman as first-officer.)  Also, just to have an excuse for a Galaxy-Class starship to be in the show, maybe Geordi's ship could be the U.S.S. Challenger like it was in the alternate-timeline in the episode 'Timeless' in *_Star Trek: Voyager._*
Lawd Jesus, please give them the send off they deserve!
I really do hope they got Colm Meaney on board and for more than just a cameo.   I get it that he was a recurring supporting role in TNG and don't expect a main role status here but some kind of contributing role in the story line would really make this complete.
No wesley
No Brent Spiner though….
Great. Where's Data?
PARAMOUNT! MAKE A KLINGON SERIES! IT WOULD BE THE SEQUAL TO DS9 WITH CHANSELOR MARTOK AND WARF AS HIS ADVISER AND REPRESENTITIVE IN THE FEDERATION! DO IT! YOU'LL MAKE ALL THE MONEY!
The cast looks good.
Since last season you erased the Borg do these people even have remotely the same relationships with each other?  Did Voyager ever get home or did the Borg come to the rescue and give them a friendly escort to the nearest trans warp tunnel?  Did the people that wrote season 3 watch TNG or will they be winging it too?
Where is Brent Spiner?
I remember when the teaser for season 2 came out. My first thought  is "well let's see how they manage to ruin what's left of TNG"
Senior Citizen Star Trek to go Boldly to Medicare
Most of the band is back together however you can't have the TNG crew complete with the  Enterprise
YES!!!!!!
I'm Down for this. We are Starfleet! Oh and the Jacket is Badass.
🤦‍♂️  please stop paramount
Whatever!
What cameos do we expect to see this season from TNG mainstays? My hopefuls:  -Alyssa Ogawa -Ro Laren -Reginald Barkley -JONES (who was literally in 88 episodes and TWO movies!) -JAE (who was in 41 episodes AND TWO MOVIES) -Nakamura -Robin Lefler
The beloved characters that showed us the people we could be, and the society we could have. I’m thrilled to see these old friends once more, but somehow my heart is in my throat.
lit lit lit epic
Barclay or we riot
Didn't Worf become the Klingon Ambassador at the end of DS9? Everyone kind of forgot about that. Maybe it'll come up again.
I had a health scare this past week which got me thinking about mortality - mine, and that of my loved ones - so this really strikes a chord with me. In all the universe, the people we care about are impossible to replace. I love that we'll get to see old friends return as a reminder of how infinitely precious relationships such as these are.  They've still got more adventures and missions in them, and so do I. It's a joy that we'll get to go on this ride together again.  I'm already engaged! ❤🖖
I am soo excited and will be in front of the tv watching Picard Season 3. I can't wait!!!
All I need now is the ship called Enterprise.
Sigh, can't do it.  This reminds me of the original cast working movies into their 70s.  Stale and old.
Fingers crossed for a Ro Laren cameo
TNG cast!!!!! Whoooohooooo!!!!
Won’t be the same without DATA
With Worf coming back...will we see Alexander as well?
I literally just screamed out loud!
But where is will Wheaton? Will Wheaton! Will Wheaton!!!!
I am down for this, I hope they get rid of that annyoing actress thats the new Borg Queen. Keep the Admiral that drop the F-Topedoes though. Still with how old they are shold be call Star Trek: The Last Generation.
LOVE IT!!!! MIke in LA, Calif
I was surprised to see Seven in a red uniform. I always pictured her as the science officer. But then again, so was Janeway before she became the captain of Voyager.
Michael Dorn, finally!!!!!! It sounded like he wasn't going to be in this series at all!
It would be great to see some DS9 and more VOY than just Seven!
They all look Awesome! I cannot wait!
Worf looks good, but after the travesty of the first 2 seasons I hope this will be much better.
🔥🔥🔥
Four pips on Worfs uniform.  Sevens pips are partially concealed, so I can't count them, but she's in a command division uniform.
I'm not crying. You're crying.
They’re keeping Seven and Raffie around? No one’s going to care about them.
You’re never without hope unless you’re Data trapped on a hard drive. Then go ahead and delete yourself instead of choosing to live again. I don’t trust this show when it speaks about hope. It seems deeply rooted in nihilism.
I hope Geordi ended up with Leah Brahms somehow, and I hope we get to see that here.
Very nice. I remain extremely skeptical however. Season 1 was bad. Season 2 was awful. Fingers crossed.
Worfs got the captains rank! ! !
This will make up for Season 2, which was garbage. What a waste of a story with Q...
Star Trek is life.
I hope Raffi doesn't ruin it
Why is there only 3 seasons of this? Sigh.
Klingons live a lot longer than Humans.  Worf's hair shouldn't be so gray already.
Another season of a show that should have never had a second season.  🤦‍♂️
It's a Next Generation reunion special!
Definitely would like to see Data and Wesley Crusher in some capacity.
I liked S2, but I felt a little let down in the end. Still good, but I guess just not what I expected or wanted (which is fine). This gets me excited again.
Awesome
Odd teaser... like something from Team America.  Just missing the hair flicking... and "Matt Damon."
I'm so excited to watch the remaining TNG characters be vandalized and destroyed!
Am I the only one that likes both Old Star Trek and new Star Trek?
I tried watching S1, but they should have used CG to de-age Brent Spiner.  An android wouldn't gain weight and develop wrinkles.  I love Patrick Stewart, but his voice sounds weak, after Picard got a new physical body, he shouldn't.   I'd rather he had his vineyard and people dropped in to visit him.
Where's data tho
Now put them on enterprise and give us what strange new worlds did to excellent effect.
Omg yes
The band is BACK BABY! 🖖🏾
I hope others drop in from TNG’s past before the end: Wesley, Kestrel, Alexander, among others.  I also hope a few from the first two seasons of Picard at least drop in for an appearance. I know that most of the cast will not be in the season proper, but let’s not rule out a potential guest spot or cameo (DMAs are always in place), if only to make that circle complete as well.  As Spock once said “There are always possibilities”. Who knows?
I excited for one last ride with TNG crew. Thank you for not using the Discovery klingon design for my man, Worf. Hopefully all the new live action klingons will follow suit.
Grandparents! Engage!!!
Haha lol word looks sick 🤣
I.... LOVE.... THIS.... CREW....  Seven in Starfleet uniform looks fantastic. Maybe we will get a Captain Kim cameo welcoming her to Starfleet
Looks like Seven does indeed stays as Stargazer's captain as she is wearing a starfleet uniform through it interesting that Raffi appears isn't for the teaser... could be something  Also Dorn looks great in is aged up Worf & now since he is still in uniform ...could we see him in command of ENT-E...would love to see the old girl even if it was a small cameo.  Lastly, I notice we don't see Spiner....so we still don't know if he going play flesh & blood Soong relative like Anton or an Android....my hope is that he is Lore and the season's big bad
I'm so excited
Now we can watch you ruin the entire cast! Too little effort for too much woke nonsense.
Am I correct, those are Captain's Pips on Seven's collar?  The "Field Commission" granted by Picard stuck?  I also count 4 pips on Riker's jacket and Worf's.  If all three are now commanding ships (Stargazer, Enterprise E or F and one other under Riker,) then Admiral Picard has a tidily little taskforce under his command.   Maybe even four if Commodore LaForge is commanding one since Starfleet Commodores can command single starships.
I rate this trailer a 7 of 9 🖖
At a fraction of the production cost, Yellowstone has done much better than all the other NuTrek shows combined, so they are desperate to try something new!
Thank god no Data. Got really sick of seeing him past, present, and future. Also what I don't understand is that Picard is dead. I don't care how you explain it, he is just another android with everything Picard had in him. But still dead. They should have either let him live, and find a cure for his disease, or let him die just like Data wanted & did.
Is Will Wheaton gonna be in this?
So awesome to see the crew return but scared what the writers are gonna do to their characters
I am glad that 7of 9 will be back with the Next Generation Cast. I know that 7's character is different than when she was on Voyager but her relationship with Picard is better than her relationship with Janeway.
I'm so glad they have Worf looking like a proper old warrior
Patrick looks like he never aged he looks the same since 1987
I'm not crying YOU'RE crying! <3
Oh my god perfection 💖😭
So very excited! This reminds me of my childhood...me and my brother watching the show together. :o)
Worf and the grey hair and his ridges looks different
Cool to see Worf in the make up
Seven in a Starfleet uniform! Yes!
They all look good, but Michael Dorn looks awesome as Worf.
I am yelling in my car!!!!!
This show is complete utter garbage. If you watched season 2, how could you be excited about this? That was not TNG, and neither will this be. If you want TNG, go watch Strange New Worlds.
I didn't see spot the cat!
I can't wait for the new season!
Where. Is. The. Enterprise?
Naw, the first two seasons can eat my a-s
Worf's makeup looks terrible. His nose is totally different, his beard looks very fake, and showing his ears is just wrong. Never once in TNG, the movies or DS9 did Worf have his ears exposed.
Nothing from season 1 or 2 makes me excited for season 3. Im expecting more failures and destruction of past characters we all loved. Please prove me wrong
I'm keen on seeing how they reintroduce Geordi, Worf and Beverly.
That smile from Sir Patrick at the end... like he's saying, "you asked for it... you got it."
Be HILARIOUS if Picard is mad at Worf because Worf and Beverly got together
Well, the writing can’t be any worse than season 2. Let’s hope they took notes from Strange New Worlds season 1 on how to actually write good episodes.
OMG can't wait. 😎
I don't think bringing back the TNG actors can save "Picard."
It makes me so happy to see most of the major TNG cast come back for Picard's final season. TNG has been my favorite sci-fi show since I was little.
I would freaking LOSE IT for a scene of Admiral Sisko! Admiral Picard welcome back to Deep Space Nine....Won't happen
Whoaaa.. Worf sounds more like Barrack Obama than Worf. It's been a long time, I imagine he's a little rusty
Wooooow
Just awesome
How do you hide everyone being old and overweight?  EVERYBODY GETS A JACKET.
To bad Data couldn't be there😢
Now we need a SISKO series
So hopeful
Mike and Rich, I pray for your souls. Only god can save you now
WOLF! it is a good day to die
OLD WORF! YASS! Give it to me now!
PERSONALLY I wanns see Worf happily married to a wpman who won't  DIE by the end of the season lol
I hope one very last character is it............the USS Enterprise!!   Hopefully the Enterprise-E.
Crusher looking good.
Almost sounds like Riker says, "No matter where you go, there you are." 😆
Be AWESOME if we see Admiral Benjamin Sisko
Hard to get excited due to track record of Picard (and Discovery). Good first episodes then the rest of the seasons are downhill.
Keeping with the LGBTQ based Agenda, Seven wills be Captain of the Enterprise with Raf as First Officer. Worf will be Captain at DS9 married to Ezri who dumped Dr Bashir lol
2 of them don't belong. both seasons were very very lackluster and the 3rd will be too..
Lets see....trailer brings the hype up. First few episides will bring up again and will be answered at the end of the series. Last few episodes will be a disapointing leaving the series in a bad review. Season 1 and 2 did that.
WOOOOOOORRRRRRRFFFFFFFFF
Watched that twice in a row... still got chills down to my freaking legs!!!!!!!!!  I know it's just a show, but TNG was with me from 5th grade to senior year... I really wish all the actors could know how much their performances helped me grow as an individual.
Getting vibes of Star Trek XII: So Very Tired
I wonder whether we’ll be on the Enterprise E (probably captained by Worf), the Enterprise F, or the Stargazer (captained by Seven)
Yoooooo almost the whole crew back!
Gandworf the White looks good! 😂👍
Aparently future fashion is aged leather
WOW, this was inspiring. Sounded like soul searching was in this, I think yall found the dream. Keep it ALIVE. Youre a BIG part of everyday activity TODAY, because the inspiration is truth.
I would love if Wil Wheaton was able to play Wesley in at least one episode.   His scene at the end of Season 2 showed how wonderful Wesley can be.    He is a part of The Next Generation family and deserves another chance to shine.
Worf was a commander since DS9. Why is his uniform yellow again. It should be red.
The original cast got a wonderful sendoff with Star Trek 6 The Undiscovered Country.  I’m still hopeful for a great sendoff for the TNG cast but this trailer strikes me as a little too smug and self referential.  We’ll see.
I thought last season was the final season. Maybe this is the final, final season?  Star Trek: The Orville is the ONLY Star Trek in production right now.
"Platitude, platitude, hope, platitude!"
Awesome! I love how the show feels like the next generation, can't wait to see Whorf. I wish we could get some of The Doctor "Joe" one day.
Star Trek: Picard AARP  😂
They better bring back Sisko
Don't let us down!
Seven in uniform!!
Worf needs to use some Just For Klingons.
Wow That looks Great.
Please have O'Brian I beg of you.
No one has the right to force a straight man to be homosexual or a Straight Woman to be Lesbian.
Literal goosebumps!
Miles O’Brien or we riot
The first thing I reacted to was oh....Worf has grey hair...lol
That's cool and all, but am I the only one legit freaking out over the jackets?! I want... No, I NEED one!
Sounds like Michael Dorn is putting a little bit of Obama into his Worf performance. I dig it.
RIKER has slim down he looks fantastic everyone does… I have a feelings some of the TNG will die to bring closer to their character…
It's just surreal to have Seven of Nine as a main cast member with the TNG crew.
WOOOOOOORFFF
I really really want this to be good, but the first two seasons give me no confidence.
Star trek : The geriatric frontier
Thank you Paramount! 🥰
Always go out on a high note. Next generation ended with an amazing episode. I hope they don't ruin their legacy. 2nd season of Picard was frankly not very good
Ooohh Yeah !!!!
Correct Worf
941 to 300  Not sure where the downvotes are coming from. I'm looking forward to everything everyone for one last story and hope they do it well.
That was the dopest trailer I've seen so far. I so cannot wait for the last season 😭😭😭
Ooo I dig Worfs look & that he's not purple & bald
The years have not been kind to Worf considering Klingons live longer than Humans. He looks like he's seen some things.
JUST WOOOOOW!!!!
This could be a perfect ending to this series.
Let’s see how long till they mess this one up like the last 2 seasons
It hurts not seeing Brent in there as Data. But we did get his closure in S1 as painful as it was! Can't wait to see all the rest though for S3!!!!   I'm still rooting for a Star Trek: Traveler series to get a green light on Paramount+ with Will Wheaton!
How am I supposed to wait until 2023??
I’m crying 😭❤️🖖
ahhhh I dont want it to end. I wish there were 6 seasons!
I LOVE this show. Every second of it.
They better have an "Enterprise", or some Starfleet ship that is impressive, at least. And go on some missions. And work well together in a story that makes sense.  All the disjointed nonsense that came before better not leak into season 3. I can't take the disappointment anymore. (Please, no "dark" plotlines of everyone hating each other, no plotlines of 5 or 6 episodes where everyone is separated and trying to find their way back to each other somehow, no "ideas" that are never turned into a story at all, and no profound sense that no one involved has ever watched an episode of Trek, ever. Please. Is that too much to ask?)
Going forward they should have a Picard origins story series called CADET PICARD in which we follow a young Jean-Luc Picard at the academy and see his transformation from a young & cocky Starfleet boy into a humble and confident captain of the Stargazer. Patrick Stewart would mostly sit in a sound studio recording narration but the parts of him seen present day giving either a lecture as a special guest or however makes the most sense will be filmed How I met your Mother style; filmed all at once in advance but shown here and there as needed but the majority just giving narration either at a studio or from home. I think with all due respect to Sir-Patrick Stewart he is too old to make these episodes and movies etc. and this would be a happy compromise for the fans imo
Worf gets a WOOF from me!
Star Trek  Sisko he's coming back.  💯💯💯💯💯
That was a lot of leather.
Uof9 and doctor still got it
Since Klingons age slower, shouldn't Worf be younger without the white hair?  Oh well, still gonna be awesome. Great to see everyone back together again.
is beverly no longer in starfleet??? what is that outfit she's wearing???
Trite, painfully cringe dialogue; this is clearly the very worst kind of nostalgia trap. Booooooo!
WORF!! And Beverly looks amazing with those silver streaks!
This looks amazing, and I hope it’s better than that terrible season 2!
The Geriatric Generation.
This looks good
Dont mess this up Alex Kurtzman!
God in heaven will the horror never end. We have to have antibiotics every time we watch STD & lets not even try to swallow Picard. Time to hang it up you have killed Trek
Who's that speaking at 0:08? Doesn't sound like LeVar
the picard series is terrible if i'm being honest, but i gotta say, old Worf looks very good.
Worf! Looking like his bad self.
omg seeing work gave me chills.
Bring back Lore.  Lore's redeption is the best thing you can do for Data now after the garbage from season 1.
Do they have new writers? The first 2 seasons are utter trash.
Omg omg Omg. Okay let’s break this down: Picard: Rank: Admiral Laforge: Admiral (!)  Riker: Captain Seven: Captain (🙌) Worf: (TNG style Klingon) Captain. Please Please be Captain of Enterprise-E or F! Crusher: Commander? Captain? Couldn’t tell. Troi: Commander (retired?) Raffi: Commander   The uniforms looked GREAT. Black leather with ranks. They look like variants or even away mission style uniforms.  Worf has a different Captain variant(?) uniform.  Raffi and Seven has TNG/Picard Era uniform.    Who is Laforge married too? Leah hopefully! He is also a father!! Woooo hoooo!  Overall: 10/10 for a teaser trailer. Hopefully season 3 can stick the landing.
Wow. Who would've guessed that the Klingon makeup style of 1979-2005 would still hold up on a modern show? I'm starting to think that the showrunners of Discovery ticked off the fans over nothing!
I know everybody else…but who is that at 0:20 ?
Also great look for Worf! Full mustache; yes please
Remember how by Star Trek V: The Final Frontier the cast so old as to defy credulity? TNG has now reached that point. This might as well be shown alongside The Golden Girls and Matlock.
Pretty sure I saw these guys all out riding on three wheelers on the weekend...
This warms my heart
What is Rogue doing in Star Trek?
star trek the next geriatric.
Where's the Enterprise? Either the E or a canonized F
Anyone wanna bet Geordi’s wife is Leah Brahms?
This feels less like a teaser and more like an apology to the fans for seasons 1 and 2.
This.  This is what Star Was never got....
Let's how they ruin it even more
Chills.
Why does Worf have grey hair? He should look the same as he did in the movies.
WORF!!!!!! That makes me so happy. I was Lt. Worf for Halloween when I was in kindergarten. Worf has been my favorite member of the Enterprise 1701-D (or DS-9)
nope
Hope the writing is better than season 2.
Got the crew back together!! I hope data and Wesley will be able to make a surprise appearance! Let’s go!!!
Omg. The emotions. 😭 Bring it on!!
The fact that Spiner is not here is really interesting since he's confirmed to return.  I smell a surprise.
Really Paramount, where are the captions...? I'm betting there are words here but, who can say...
Needs Pulaski.
Can we make Wesley Crusher the notorious villain behind it all!? Please!
Does LaForge have contacts? WHY? His natural eyes gained sight during ‘Insurrection’… seems unnecessary to give him blue eyes
I want a Worf series after this with DS9 cast.
PS1-5, PS2-1, PS3-? I can only pray it's at least compelling & coherent.🙏 STD, S1-4=3. SNW-9 for me! Great teaser for PS3!
😭😭😭
Let's Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why is Star Trek now nothing but embarrassingly bad melodramatic dialogue?
The reunion is happening Holy cow
Always great teasers. Great premieres for the seasons but it does surely fall off throughout the respective season. Hopefully this last season will be good. I can def say amazing on Worf's design.
They didn't change Worf's look. I'm happy.
I am so happy Seven of Nine and Raffi are still central to this story. I love TNG but Star Trek: Picard wouldn't be right without those two.
The greatest would be to see Seven in the command chair.....she has earned it a thousand times!!  DD
They got the band back together and they're ready to rock!  Hopefully they get the send off they deserve!
do you think Will Wheaton gets his own show in the future?  He did drop in on season 2 briefly as Wesley playing a time  "traveler"  I could easily the writers spinning off a show for him along those lines
I’ll be there, watching until the end. 💙
TEARS!!!!!
So what ship will they have?
Starring Patrick Stewart  Jonathan Frakes  LeVar Burton  Michael Dorn  Gates McFadden Marina Sirtis  Also Starring  Michelle Hurd Jeri Ryan  Colm Meaney And  Whoopi Goldberg
I really would like to be inspired to watch season 3, but season 2 broke my interest after episode 3. Just went downhill from there.
If the season mirrors EXACTLY what I just saw here, I might just give it a watch!
Right in the childhood in all the right ways.
All is lost.....All is lost. Abandon ship....abandon ship....Run Forest....Run......😔😔😔
Oh man, they are going to completely destroy these characters :(
PLEASE BE BETTER THAN SEASON TWO.
You really do fail up in hollywood.  Seriously let it die...
every one of these people has aged like fine wine. Can’t wait to see S3.
Worf’s makeup looks incredible.  Take note, Discovery. 🙌🏻🙏🏻😃
Engineering to Bridge- We're Losing Containment!
OMG admiral laforge and captain worf
Would have been better if they showed Brent spiner but great to see cast back
I am so ready!!
Final season? Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…..  😭
I have not watched this show.  But, Worf looks great.
Yess!!! Worf isn't a Discovery Klingon! Haha
These uniform redesigns are getting a little excessive.
Omg WORF!!!!!!
Everyone looks fantastic. Especially Worf.
Um chills......cannot wait
OMG! The first time I've seen a Klingon since Star Trek Enterprise/Star Trek Nemesis. All we have been getting is either Blingons (JJ movies) or Klingorcs (Discovery)!
Captain LaForge it is a pleasure
Ugh. Raffi? Seriously?
They're back! love their look.
Where’s Data?
This is it.  The TNG crew is coming back for one last ride to get their proper send off.  Looking forward to the final season. ^_^
Looking forward to this!
I'm not crying, it's allergies 🥲
The only thing that could possibly make this season better would be if Ro Laren makes an appearance.
This is the most PERFECT teaser! The cast looks FANTASTIC!!! This will become one helluva conclusion!
YES! They got Worf's design right.
Where's Wesley Crusher?
👍👌☝️😊
Not my favorite star trek but definately happy to see the OG crew back for one last time on screen. Cant wait for this actor panel for the show
I expect Miles O'brien. Don't let me down.
The band is back together! Can’t wait for season 3. 👏👏💕💕
So good this does.. Word looks great
Picard keeps getting better and better, shame this is going to be the last season
Profesor x is back.
Yowza and Woo-hoo!
Yes Geordi and Worf Troi Riker was to see too Westley last season season 3 will be awesome.
🤔
Worf looks like a certified badass in his old Klingon age. KA'PLAH!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The gang is back together. Cannot wait 😍💕❤️
Looks like we will see a Captain Worf. Perhaps Captain of the Enterprise?  Also, were those Admiral pips on Geordi?
At least they didn't redesign Worf to conform to the current Klingon appearance.
We loved them, we've bonded with them and now they are back for one last adventure.
Vague emotional dialogue with characters looking dramatic. Can we get a real trailer?
omg 7 in a uniform!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes! The TNG crew are here!
I wish they'd written well so far
This show is SOOOOO bad
