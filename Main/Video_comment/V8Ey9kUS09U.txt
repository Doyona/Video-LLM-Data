The final tip at 15:45 has been patched (kind of) in the latest update. But if you managed to have stuff equipped before the update you can still keep them in your inventory slots.
It sure the glider thing is a glitch the glider just takes your momentum into account you can replicate the speed by sliding down hills and jumping to then glide without the grapple gun altogether
I think the feed box needs some love with pals eating stuff that keeps them buffed or eating things with higher SAN or nutritional values when there’s a greater need
developers made you say di*k toys lol
For food box, you should instead change what can go inside to ONLY food. This way cooked food goes in there and the things like wheat and tomatoes will go to the cooler instead cause it CAN'T go into the food box.   Trading Pals can be done with a Guild Palbox. Set the Pal you want to give away as an active Pal "Working" the base. Then the other person can go and pick it up. At least that is what I've been able to do in my friend's private server.
You can change the settings of the feed box to not accept ingredients, and only accept cooked meals, preventing your Pals from eating SAN-less food and hurting your ability to make dishes.  On that end, Salad is relatively easy (Lettuce and Tomato), gives a good amount of Nutrition, gives a *hefty* amount of SAN, *and* gives a bonus to your Pals Work Speed.
Just a quick note on the grapling hook glider trick. You can use hangyu's gloves while having a hangyu in your team and it will give you a slight ascension during gliding. Doesn't sound like much but in my opinion it's a must if you want to maximize travel distance. Also as far as i know you don't have to cancel the grapling hook, you can just press your jump button and you will whip out your glider.   Edit: Forgot to mention to keep an eye on your stamina bar while high up in the air. If you run out of stamina mid-air you can try and graple hook onto something that is near you and it will help with the landing, it might save your life.
See I've turned off item weight and a lot of my problems went away
Do you need to have a dedicated ice pal working on the cooler for it to work?
Cool HQ Cosplay. Can you change the colour of your armour in game, or did you need a mod for that, please?
I'll tell you all another trick with the glider.  While gliding, each glider has its own behavior when it comes to how it moves.  Most will start off with a nearly horizontal glide but will start to lose altitude gradually faster the longer you glide.  However, this glide curve can be reset using a quick maneuver mid-glide.  If you retract your glider and then pull it back out, it will reset the glide curve just like if you had pulled it out for the first time after jumping.  Using this technique, you can make it glide over a longer distance than you would with a regular glide.  When combined with a 'fast glider' trick such as the one in this video, you could glide some crazy distances.  Just be careful when going over water or high elevations.  This trick only resets the curve, but it won't reset the stamina.
Omg, thank you for the amazing tips!!!
thx so much for quick stack omg :D 1 year later btw
I never saw the quick stack option. tysm
Tip for newcomers, theyve added easy bulk storage, which quick stacks to all nearby chests. Just press RT in your inventory
You can lock the feed box from the pals putting ingredients in that means uncooked berries, cotton candy, wheat etc etc and set your cooler to only accept ingredients… also you can have your pets transport your cooked food from fire pit or cooking pit if you hit the checkbox at the bottom right of the screen when it says “cook”. Just an fyi
I learned a lot ty
I totally missed the quick stack feature! I kept thinking I wish they had it though lol!
Yeah, this much later, I finally watched this video and quick stack...  Yeah, never read the tool tips at the bottom.....
Why do so many guys play as female characters?! I never understood why and always had the thought that guys either think other players will feel bad for them and give them free stuff ( that was a actual thing from online games in the early 2000s like RuneScape. Players were more likely to give free stuff to girls the guys so they a why I had that idea for many years ) or simply guys just get off on watching the female characters walk around. Stuff like hit boxes don’t change so that’s not the reason… please someone help me actually understand the reason instead of my just thinking most people are just weirdos getting off on video games or trying to pull the poor me I have no stuff help help me
5:06  Just give yourself a Chikipi Ranch... and feed ALLL the Pals at your base Fried Eggs...  It's cheap, it's effective, and it's funny to know that Chikipi's have no problem with infanticide cannibalism.  ALSO, you can just set the feed box to ONLY accept food, and reject ingredients.
Love the glider grapple trick, kind of like the Prawn in Subnautica. Or I think Just Cause games have a similar mechanic?
Food box tip helped me out the most here. Them eating the food from left to right. Learned about dropping pals too
Its crazy how big this game is considering its in fking beta
the most helpful tip was quick stack thank you
There's actually a button that when you're in your base, you can just open your inventory and quick stack into any chests that have the items nearby. So you dont even need to open any chests unless its a new item you need to put away! This has saved me so so much time especially when im carrying too much weight. Just always try to keep one of something in a chest so it can autosort it into the chests
I’m a long time hyper efficient player. Most of these tips are for absolute beginners. I don’t think anyone who got to level 40/50 even once needs any of these tips.
Did they patch the ability to purchase things from merchants you captured? I caught one of the traveling merchants and he’s in my box but when I bring him out I don’t have the option to speak with him. Playing on PS5 in 2025.
Didn't know about the quick stack, thanks!!
Beware guild members can destroy chests that are locked.
Always give them pizza 🍕
Level 30 here and just finding out about the quick stack..
FYI now you can just set the feeder to not allow ingredients
.... 17 hours in and I didn't realize there's quick stack
The stun baton = +2 catching power.  Using a high quality pickaxe like the Pal Metal pickaxe or greater demolishes ore deposits in seconds.
You can just pull the glider out without cancelling the grapple now
You might not fool an Architect  with that fake room trick or a Architecture engineering enthusiast. Edit: For san issues just put them in the palbox to regen before it runs to low.
I will continue to move items individually 'cuz inventory management is my tism.  Quickstack be damned!
Omg thank you for telling me about the quick stack button
I’m sure someone has said this but set your pal food container to not take ingredients
I don't know if its patched yet but when using the global pal box if you get a pal you havent caught yet, drop the pal and pick it up for the catch credit
Lol why cheat? You can just edit world settings to make the player nearly invincible, same with pals. You do you, I'm just saying devs patch these often, so it's much easier to use the slots for what they're made for and still have nearly infinite health. Have a good day!
I made an ore mining facility 2 and put 3 digtoise on it. Going on 23k ore in storage
How’d do you get the different color amor ?
didnt know about the R key for inventory stacking either. lol
Secret rooms aren't so secret after youtubers advertise how to get into them, so... thanks. 😂
Alright guys listen i bought the game nothing special but i ended up playing 12 hours day 1 after buying the game grinding idk what it is but i enjoy this game a lot
Question. If pals need to eat food that gives San. Does this make easymode harder? If you reduce the amount pals eat (frequency) then in theory they get less San and thereby will become sick...  Unless the hunger has a hidden stat do less hungry, less San used.
Just gonna say u can filter feed box like a chest just unchecked ingredients and pals will put stuff straight into cooler
Нда. как понимаю - читать сейчас люди не любят? Всё, что вы описали(ну, кроме реальных багов/глитчей) НАПИСАНО по мере прохождения в "обучении"! Это такие ОКОШКИ, в которых появляются СОВЕТЫ по мере постройки/прохождения. Плюс информация пишется в скилах палов!!
I never noticed the quickstack.. fuck I feel dumb
Change chest settings on feed box, make it food only, no ingredients. Let the ingredients go into guild chest so they don't spoil
Only problem with picking up a dropped pal- it won’t unlock their saddle unless you catch it yourself. Figured this out early trying to give newbies a flying mount
I thought the slide jump glide was good but never thought about the grapple hook😮
You had a Helzephyr instead of a Shadowbeak! Dude, I just bread a Shadowbeak with Astegon and Kitsun and replaced my Helzephyr! 😂
This is a good video but I think you should do do an updated video with the chest updates, changes in play, information on special pals and the power of the condenser and the partner skills
Pro tip, change you storage setting to either include or not, exactly what you want stored ie: no ingredients
I didn't know about the left to right thing with the food.
I WAS SOLD AT THAT QUICK STACK LIKE WTF HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT😭😭 subbed❤️
They don’t mine slow the mining skill gives you more ore than if you were to mine even though you break the node faster than them
cheats are for Weeklings iv done my best work under pressure! 💪😬
Or you just set your settings on your food box to not allow ingredients and they'll only put cooked food in there.
Glitch is patched 😢
S a n is an abbreviation of sanity it’s not s a n it’s san 😂
“Mental stability or San” why not say sanity what it’s short for 😂
Assuming they have fixed the that accessory glitch now
Also for the black market guy, I discovered by catching low level merchants early on, you can put your humans in the display boxes and then talk to the humans through the boxes so that you don't even have to have your humans in a slot on the farm and waste a working pal slot! 😁
8:03 you know you can fix the settings to your feed box so pals CAN'T put ingredients in right?  I would invest in making different foods too. Lots of foods offer boots when you eat it, such as better WORK SPEED, defense, attack, better SAN, etc. 😁
Woolipop gives cotton candy which has 5 sanity
Toggle to activae is great btw
Bro I’ve been playing since like the start of early access almost, and I didn’t know quick stack 😂
SANity.....
Really Glad I watched this today after playing this since update I was really wishing I could quick switch items to a chest looked all over for a mod but didn't find anything! Today you are the REAL MVP for this video! LOL Thank you!!!
I just found out about the RB quick stack at like lvl 30! 😢
A lot of these tips are actually exploits and will probably be patched.
The grapple hook trick works with glider pals too. So does sliding. Can get some serious speed and distance with the Galeclaw.
Something that is kind of funny that I don’t know if anybody has said yet- when I started playing about a week ago it took me three days to figure out There was a quick stack button  It’s sort of ironic because that means when you walk up to a chest  you hit FR   So when I told the other people that I’m playing with in discord , someone legit said “wait.. FR?” And I said “yes F then R”   It took them a second to get it.. but yea.. I’m not often funny but oh boi did I take the dad joke potential
Update on the feed box there is a setting to not allow ingredients so they will put the farm items in the fridge instead
Still using digtoise? Oh man, I remember not knowing how bad digtoise is.
I’m still mid game (lvl 40), but about the food, I can manage my pals with 2 farms of tomato and 2 of lettuce, without cooking. I’ve never had any pal sick, ever since
Did you know about being able to glide with a pal
How do i get to the oil rig? And when i get there, how tf do i survive?
hilarious, i keep the interactive map on my other screen too
SAN is short for sanity
I think they patched a lot of stuff like this now days ☹️
See, these are real tips. Everyone keeps posting just basic stuff 😅. Thank you dude! 😎
I was 150+ hours in before I accidentally deleted my save, but back then I didn’t know what the quick stack shortcut was for controller, and I’m a console player, so it’s not just you 😅
For the grappling hook trick: you can point at any surface that is same level as your feet(you can point lower, but higher doesn’t work) time the jump right before the hook ends and bam you take off
With a hot tub, I haven't had to feed them anything but regular berries.
Thanks for the quick stack, I didn't see that command there either.
Here because i successfully caught jetragon solo but just get one tapped by all the other legendarys. Saw the base method on another video and clicked on yours. I just found out i can quick stack. Lmao.
The cooler needs an ice pal assigned to it to be effective 😅
Im lvl 20 now, but my next journal/mission is to fight a boss named lily, she got 63.000hp….. how am i suppose to beat that
I use hot tubs for my pals to get there SAN up. Makes it way easier so you don’t have to pay as much attention to feed boxes.
I did not know bout quick stack so yes thank you much bud
I have almost 200 hours in Palworld, how in the ever loving crap did I not know about quick stacking?
Or, keep feeding your pals regular berries because the hot tubs and the pal beds get upgrades, and them sleeping and relaxing in the hot tub refills their SAN by a lot
That quick stack Tip was HUGE I didn't know either 😂😂
Jam filled buns 😊  😂😂😂
I didnt know about quick stack n i just got lvl50....also with the food tip you can make it so your pals dont put ingredients into the feed box so they just put the ingredients into the cooler box
Quick stack is an advanced tip? Do people not read button prompts?
So u need to buy all pals fron the seller and then it will appear new ones??
Just build a hot spring i only feed them red Barry's and the hot spring brings the san up 5:35
Owen Wilson voice is so smoothing
I'm just new to the game but I never have I ever got depressed pals. I simply put their feed box next to their bed. And then next to their bed is a bath thub. Regardless if you are just feeding them berries, the sanity will hold back 100% once they took the bath.
7:05 me staring at the expiring cake
I didn't know about the chest moving thing either...I have been right clicking on everything to move it over.
9:30 good tip but the percentage also went up because you're throwing the ball at the pal's rear, which also increases capture chance
yeah don't think quick stacking is an advanced tip my man lmao
NEXT YEAR WTF EVERYONE LIED THEY SAID P FALL FUCK YOU APPLE I JUST SWITCHED TO A SAMSUNG BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFO ON THE NEW SEASON
I did not know about the quick stacking until you showed it to me in this video. Thank you.  :)
The grapple cancel surprised me once. I accidentally launched myself out of my base, which was on a cliff.
Also sliding down hill then activating your glider has the same effect on the flying speed. The Gliders are momentum based. For those who are new!
That cotton candy feeder tip is so handy. 2 weeks in I noticed the food order issue. Makes sense now I know about it 😄
With the hidden room, chests and such can be accessed from outside of the room, they’re not as hidden as you’d think. The access buttons will appear through walls. My boyfriend tested this for days before we finally saw that it was useless 😭
Same here, didn't know about quick stack 😂. Thanks!
funny thing while i found the stack all option right away it took me forever to find the move this one stack over option. anytime I didn't want to use the quick stack I had been dragging items from one slot to the other box
Bro that quick stack was the greatest thing of all time how the bell did I not realize that
I would advise caution exploiting the game as Palworld has a massive cliff where it won't be fun anymore, so just get your moneys worth, and above all else; enjoy!
Several good tips. Thank you. I do wonder though- do merchants respawn where they were captured if you catch them? Or are they gone forever?  Also how close can you get to ore spawns without causing a problem with respawning?
Guess I need to find me a black marketeer And that glider trick...somebody's been playing Just Cause
Man that pal box next to boss spawn is possibly best tip I ever seen
I learned about quick stack from a friend and kept forgetting the hotkey. so i kept asking every session for like 4 sessions b4 I started to remember
thanks my guy
They need this map thing on Xbox
Thank you and that you are not the only one now I know that now I can do it for me I have issues of that too
I have almost 100 hours in palworld and I’m just now learning about the quick stack feature
Great tips, thanks. I didn't know any of those.
owh thank god u mentioned this one, I needed it cuz they always eat the raw one lol 6:37
6:22 no one's gonna talk about this? :(
2:15 I guess we would call those pals the Suicide Squad
You can quick stack?!?! My entire Palworld existence feels like a fever dream... So many seconds wasted on slowly moving items one-by-one... 💀
I never knew either I discovered that maybe 2 days ago on top I noticed there a menu tell you what saddles and essentials you have 😅
This video was made for your mom who never seen an xbox
3:28 imagine this gets patched and you can't get your supplies back and the only way to get it is by breaking your house 😂😂
Wonder if your poor digtoise digging is due to the last base visit rule on production?
thank you for your words about gatekeeping. I have less than 2 hours/ daily to play and I use WeMod so I won't need to farm and I choose only have fun with my pals. some of my friends thinks it's a lame thing to do. but I have so much responsabilities I just wanna have some fun with my scarce free time. thanks for the kind words, really.
Love it my man! did not know a few of these tips and they are awesome, this game is addictive. My 12 yr old and me play it together and need to keep up with him. Keep it up brother
Subscribed for the RB shortcut haahhaahahahah
How does your game look so much better than mine? I'm playing Xbox Series S and the textures CONSTANTLY pop out and freezes a lot in combat.
5:00 sounds like you never tried lego fortnite
Quickstacking thank you GODDDD
Thank you very much, very useful tips!
Great tips. Thanks.
This is the best Palworld tips I've seen, period.  (Most of the others aren't even worth looking at if you've played at least an hour of the game already.)
More please 🙏
I’m 4 tips in and my mind is blown. I’m lvl 49 and don’t know anything apparently. The quick stack is life changing. And the vendor in your base? Wow.
Quik stacc, Noted 👌🏿
cooked 44 berries 44k xp on pals mate u doing it sneaky with xp multiplication
Love that
How do I get unlimited coins
How do you clip stairs in the ground
Quick stack OMG!
Definitely never noticed the quick stacking until I watched this video, thank you for that - level 49 player cursing the time I wasted lol
Yea I definitely did not know about being able to quick move items into the chest like that 😂😅
Ohhh that makes sense. I had no idea why they kept putting the milk wheat honey and milk in the feed box instead of my chest. Although I didn’t mind since they were basically feeding themselves
my mine base is the same x) nice vid thnx
You are incorrect on the baked berries thing. I have spent my entire game just feeding my base Pals baked berries and only very rarely have them get sick or injured. All food above baked berries, cakes for breeding, and maybe salads are a complete waste of effort to produce, at least for base pals.  You are also wrong about Digtoise's mining. You're supposed to condense a digtoise and increase his attack stat. My max-condensed digtoise with legend, musclehead, lucky, and ferocious can mine an ore node on his own in about 7 seconds I think, without using his ability.
If guild members are stealing from you.. it’s a crappy guild.
Quick stack is great.   Click left thumbstick to pull everything from container to inventory.   Click right thumbstick in an inventory or container to auto sort  Cheers
I didnt know you could fast travel from the palboxes i thought you could only respawn and teleport to them lol
Quick stack is probably the most underrated tip in this whole video! Can't wait to not combine everything one by one :D
If you lure the one out of the mineshaft by kingpaca you can put campfires by his lantern you can log out and back in and catch him without doing anything cause he dies from the campfires
Just got palworld today and for the most part already knew a lot about the game but your quick stacking tip! Huge time saver man and the making sure food box is full tip, as well as the digtoise mining when i eventually get him thanks!
What's funny is a lot of people don't seem to pay attention to their HUD, in the bottom right of the chest menu, below the item box, there are the controls for the chest, and one such control option they show you there is "RB: Quick Stack" or "R: Quick stack" that is how I learned, I saw the controls list in the bottom right and tested it out
I was wondering what the quick stack did. Now I know I'm just retarded
If you put usable items in a locked chest, the guild can still use them without access to the box
Your feedbox tip is wrong. If you have a pal out that likes a specific food over the other they will eat it first regardless of its position in the feed box. I have seen them eat pancakes bread wheat all which were in a second or 3rd slot behind berries. So no they will eat what they prefer regardless of the slot.
I really hope that they keep all of the janky grappling hook movement in the game, so much fun.
People cheesing the hell out of everything then complaining the game is too easy
Gotta say I’m surprised how many people didn’t use the stack items button. It was one of the first things I realized when I was playing.
You are my savior i was doing the same stupid shit of moving one at a time omg me and my not reading habits thank you so much
I have 2 bases(1 for stone barebone fed berries no special beds normal hot spring) 2nd base (meta pals not alright rolls on them. They mostly all have large beds and fed salads for optimum productivity yet they are all depressed or weakened.) Idk if some are bugged or what?
omg i didn't know about the quick-stacking, that's game changing
Please only use the glider if you have to, other than that carry a galeclaw and get galeclaw gloves sm faster
I was literally saying to myself I wanted a quick stack button how did I not see that…
"If you're into breeding" is a sentence I never thought I'd ever hear in a game guide.
Really helpful vid. Thx bro. Keep up the good vids!
I got this game not just cause i was bored but glad it can be played single player, hate the grind and level capping where you deal only 1dmg to bosses your not up to deal with just says this game has no valid point to complain about players using cheats because this type of mechanic is not skilled based, it's grind, any noob can grind with time.
SAN Stands for sanity
One of the thing that I was hating on was the fact if you die you lose everything and also it was taking a long time to gather items and other stuff good thing I found the custom stuff that helped a lot
You just gained a subscriber my friend
Omg I didn’t realize you can quick stack in the chests either. You’re not alone. Thank you for the tip!!!
Love the video and layout of tips. There were actually a few I didn't even know of. :) Thanks for taking the time to create.
Played long enough for level 21 did not know you could quick move to chests
Please don’t beg for likes and subscribes. If your content is good enough people will do that anyway.
everything ok but the bug abusing...
"that's a trick to make secret rooms!"  ...which now is secret anymore.
That glitch is lame
You can use the grapple slingshot with gliding pals too, Galeclaw in particular lets you use weapons while gliding and is faster than gliders anys
Move all the same item was actually goated! Cheers man
When you say Pal I hear Owen Wilson saying Wow
The boss fighting base is such a good idea!
I recommend feeding Pals salad! It increases WORK SPEED and restores a good amount of sanity at the same time! Very easy to make with lettuce and tomatoes.
I love how the equipment swap glitch was patched right after you posted this.
No point in having a 2nd food in there. After they eat the jam buns they will start putting wheat in that slot and eat that mostly. If you want 2 foods then just don't have a freezer and keep all wheat/lettuce/etc in later slots so they are put there.
This video was impressive. Impressively terrible. "Advanced" and two of the things were using basic menu functions. Others were simply strictly poor suggestions like gliding showcase with 0 mention of the power of gliding pals.
I think my pals ate my cakes I hid in my bedroom chest. Those bastards. Or maybe I ate it. I don’t remember
There is a boost for capturing when you capture pal from the back 😊
Finished pal world on custom settings (made it very easy) just to get a hold of it since the game csn be very confusing so it might help
Quick stack tip was much needed thank you
In case no one knows, the Dodge roll/flip (by default, Ctrl on pc + wasd), has invincibility frames. I don't know the timing, how many frames you have with the animation, but as an uncle, who tried the Souls series, because of my nephews (you little punks don't remeber demons souls, huh? 😅), they are there. I soloed the first Boss tower with dodge rolls, and Bushi, the samuria pal near the ruined church, with my novice knowledge of inv frames, and a underleveled pal to distract them.
My pals are really quick to mine all of the ore, but sometimes they cant sense it on the ground and dont transport it to the chest. Still passively gets me a ton of ore
Digtoise is honestly a horrible miner. Breeding 3-5 anubus is way faster, and they will transport the ore when done. Also, they are manufacturing monsters, so the base can utilize the ore they mine
So many useful tips. Thank you so much.
nice the moving items into your storage box is deffs helpful thanks heaps
I have an important question that needs to be addressed for Pal World 😅 If you capture an npc place in your base. And someone not in your guild is looking for npc...  1) can they access your shop keeper you have captured? If they enter your base?  2) will these npc repawn?  3) will this be a repeat of all your sheep belong to us?
3:32 peak security!
11:00 May I ask the location of that mining site?
There is a fun thing about transporting that was a rude awakening for me - the level of transporting only matters for STACKS of items - but pals transport items from nodes and trees only one piece at the time - so don't get your hopes up about that sweet level 4 transporting on Wumpo Botan... Speed is the only thing that matters... So you have to measure which pal gets slowed down and how much by carried items - Anubis is good but easily distracted, Catress is fine, Lovanders are good if there are no low tier mining nodes and quarries around, Dazzi is not too shabby either, but some pals like Depresso or Flambelle get horribly slowed down.   As for meals... You don't really need anything beyond Baked Berries.  I haven't had any trouble with sanity once I started using them - they are also very efficient to produce. You can get Bristla, then Petalia and then Lyleen and any semi-decent watering pal and you have your farms settled. Lyleen, Gobfin and ANY kindling pal can feed a full 15 pal base with baked berries alone, and you will have ever-growing stack of them anyway.   Now... LATER on, once you unlock tomato and lettuce plantations, you might think of replacing berries with salad - it is a simple recipe, not too resource intensive AND salad provides a 30% work speed buff - meaning it may be a decent option for your production base.   As for mining - I find digtoise to be inefficient at mining.  Mining nodes seems to have capped speed - one "attack cycle" has damage capped to mining level of a pal - so Digtoise's spin will do the same total damage as say... Anubis's punch... BUT Digtoise takes longer time to execute the spin. Basically - when mining at your base - if you have nodes, get Anubis, seriously. And don't build a quarry, otherwise your mining pals will prioritise it over nodes.
you can repair all your gear with the r key at the repair station toast with berry jam is a step up from cooked berries you can jump ontop a to be captured sphere and get a rocket launch height boost, dont try withouta glider tho best way to mine is mammoerests stomp attack
I really wish that the hacker problem wasnt so bad otherwise the game is amusing.
Bro the food tips are CLUTCH
Quick stack needs to be mandatory  in games like this. Thanks for pointing it out!
Why do you sound like Lightning McQueen?
and boom... you cheated!!
I’m gonna try this food method today. My guild has two other based. But when I go to get on. They’re all just depressed and weakened. And I’m tired of buying medicine or crafting it lol. I told em I’m done fixing em man lol.
another thing that would have saved me a lot of time: the Jetragon saddle is unlocked at lvl 50. It´s no use to spend hours and hours trying to catch it underleveled with a 0.3 chance
Your quickstack tip earned you my like, thank you sir and have a good one!
The hidden storage chest would only be good for items that arent materials that can be drawn for creating items. So pal skills or armor etc would be fine.
Thanks for all the spoilers...jerk.
The boss thing just ruins the purpose of the game tbh
That storage tip tho lmao this definitely is me right now. Happy ass f I watched this lmao
Storing ingredients or items that can be used to craft things in a locked chest does NOT prevent those items from being pulled out by the crafter. The only things you can safely store are items that aren't used to craft, such as guns, ammo, blueprints, move fruits, etc.
Just in case any of yall haven’t ventured into the lava caves or ice mountain caves… when going through hallways watch the floor; there are several holes in the floor allowing you to slip under the map, this isn’t even utilizing any type of clipping method, you legit fall through a hole they forgot to put a piece of floor over, it’s very common, watch your step, if you’re quick enough you can glide and get your mount out, otherwise if you let your stamina drain it’s almost certain death in the icy ocean beneath the world lol
Thanks!
Lvl 50 here playing with a 4 year old and 6 year old so settings are about as easy as u can get. Still hella fun my children love it.
Are you the same swany caught cheating on COD?
Is the quick stack thing the same as right clicking on time?
Where's your base located?
So tip 3 I think with the base thing never knew very clever and the quick stack thing I feel so stupid not knowing I was doing the same thing one by one 🤦 this video was so eye opening in general aside from those specific tips I mentioned thank u so much🎉😊
the grimclaw gloves... way better than glider. Yeah, pal box at bosses I found when I built to close to Anubis for coal lol. Also u picked bad pals for mining, those spiked turtle guys are a scam and eat all ur food too lol.
Also a tip, if you want to level up super fast go into game settings and change the xp rate.
Obe issue with your secret storage room tip... You can hide your chest but the items are still in crafting XD
where is your base located and can you do a base building tutorial
QUICK WHAT? Just a single button press and all the items are moved over???
LOL this clown thinks READING is an advanced trick... of course he is a controller player.
When do you get to the advanced tricks?
Had no clue about right bumper till today. Thankyou
That base boss trick is the ultimate coward strategy
How to get saved and be right with God for eternal life, from the King James Bible.  10. "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” Romans 3: 10+23 (KJB)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." 12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:” Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)  9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10."For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." 13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)  1."Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2."By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)  27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" 28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.” Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)  "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.” Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)  “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6: 23 (KJB)  (Lastly here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins for eternal life.) “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.  I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins.  I trust in him alone to save me.  Nothing else.  Not my good works or anything else.  Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”
Loving the tips, especially the quick drop options that I was not aware off 🤦🏻‍♂️
Digtoise is bugged currently when in your base. They will only do 1 damage for some reason.
You can make capturing the Black Marketeer easier with a trap by the by
good guide, thx!
SANity
The armor glitch has been patched out of the game.
Tip I found in credit if u die in water and u can't get ur stuff u can just be above the area and will be able to get ur stuff back
I too, have not known this. I now wish to stare into the abyss of all the time i coulda saved
Who says "ESS AY ENN" instead of "Sanity"
Didn't know bout quick sort you've saved me
Regarding Cooking:  You don't need to cook for SAN. It helps but it is so not necessary. Just upgrade your pal beds to fine beds and make one or two hot springs and SAN should never be a problem.
This is a “little busted” he says, 1500hp later😂
The secret room doesn't really help much when crafting uses resources from every chest inside your base. Hopefully they change that
that armor stack glitch is most definetly patched I would say make use of your time catching as many tower bosses as you can im not catching 200 of them each but I will catch 4 then 16 so I can at least have all my tower bosses as 2 star level. the glitch to use the wanted level for a quick catch is still working as of today I done it 5 minutes ago
OMG, this was SO usefull! Thank you so much!
I never got how people constantly get sick pals when I've very much done the berry method and never had issues. Not sure what I'm doing differently. Maybe the 3 hot springs?  Also base-Digtoise suck. Singular hit pals like Tombat, Anubis and Reptyro tend to be a ton better. Team-Digtoise is amazing though. I highly recommend getting a Alpha-Digtoise because the size difference actually matters.
Playing about a week now.. just found the quick stash yesterday lol😂
QUICK STACKING?! ARE YOU KIDDKNG ME???  Now I feel dumb. Thanks for the tip man.
Largely a bunch of exploits and stuff that was known weeks ago. No one uses Digtoise in their mining bases, that has been discussed to death on all forums.
Thanks for the quick stack tip i didnt know either 😂
It's like Owen Wilson teaching us how to play Palworld. lol
Woah. Haven't heard of these before! Thank you so much! These are next level tips!
Only learn 1 thing and it’s the glitch tips so I learn nothing today damm I’m strong and late game haha
6:20 I cook up a crap ton of Berry buns for my pals. It restores a lot of their energy while replenishing a lot of their san
bro what i didn’t even know the quick stacking. thanks G helped at least me out 💪🏽
I feel like the quick stack was a stealth update.
Berries aren’t a problem. I have 25 beds for 20 pals 8 large the rest small and 4 high qual hot springs and man they’re happy perfect San all the time. It’s about making sure the don’t get stuck and they can always go relax
That stacking materials tip is great bud!
You can also use cotton candy in a feed box to keep ur pals sanity up without cooking. Just use a Woolipop or 2 in a ranch and a delivery pal to keep the stock up automatically
i did the boss thing for my first base, it was the fish guy at level 14 so we can just farm ancient items easily
If u have food that's going to expire u can drop it and pick it back up the timer restarts
THERE'S A QUICK STACK OPTION? 😭😭😭
bro got lvl 50 before realizing you can quick stack🤣🤣
I stopped watching for a bit after that Quick Stack tip 💀… 55h in the game
Where is the best mining base location? Ore coal etc
That Right Bumper tip made your video
5:03 i didn't know either 😢
12 glitches and things that'll be patched in the next month you didnt know about.
Glider/Grapple: Just Cause 😁
The only reason why your capture rate was higher was bc you were behind the pal
Quick tip, if you go out and capture multiples of the same pal, you can create a dystopian society where those with all the power control all the food, and those who grow the food starve while doing all the work!
Me who played Just Cause 3 and 4. Loved graple gliding.
Man the keeping a base for a boss battle tip is probably the best tip ive heard super smart I would have never thought of that 😅
Awesome guide friend. Super nice!
Oh my poor babies have been on a berry  diet since launch 😭😭😭
The main tip I can suggest is when playing with friends DO NOT JOIN EACH OTHERS GUILDS it is more of a hinderance then it is a benefit at the current state of the game you can still do dungeons and towers together when not in a guild and you are not using up each others resources and thus slowing down each others progress, sure you are limited on who gets what base location but the world is massive and you can find plenty of good locations and even share resources if you need them anyway
thanks for r
@swanyPlaysGames 11:30 You pal Don't mine nor cut tree when you're not in the base itself.
Having cooked food for you pals is also preferred over berries because it will fill their hunger meter a higher amount.  This gives your base pals a productivity boost due to reducing the number of times they have to stop working and travel to the feed box  I cook and put the salad (lettuce + tomato) in the feed box since it's supposed to give a work speed boost.  Build a cooking pot right next to each of your feed boxes and cook up a 30-50 count stack of the cooked food you are feeding them and then leave the food in the cooking station.  Cooked food doesn't start to spoil until you remove it from the cooking stations, so I always have a stack ready at the cooking station next to the feed box for when the food in the feed box starts to gets low.
Something people might not know is that if you want to use 3rd or 2nd base as a quick teleporation waypoint, then it's best to have it built anywhere prior to this. When you hover over your base on the map you can disasemble it and all the resourceswill go into your inventory allowing you to build it even if your inventory is empty. In fact if you ever want to teleport to the base it works the same. Disasemble, build, teleport, disasemble and place it elsewhere for future use. Works great if you explore too far and want to go back immediatelly.
That grapple hook trick is straight out of Just Cause
Cheese and exploits are bad "tips"
Can this game be played offline?
We have the same ore base location
Someone tell him SAN is sanity
With Digtoise Mining its not juat the Special Ability with the Headband built it increases ore mining efficiency passively for a digtoise thats in your party…… man i wish pal gear buffs transferred to pals in the base as well.
I did not know. Lol
I managed to do a glitch with the glider I have never been able to replicate. I managed to open it while climbing and got stuck in a weird climbing/gliding I basically had infinite height. Took myself to the tree to find out it's pointless. Don't go to the tree
As for the feedbox tip, I sat and watched the feedbox inventory for a bit as I was wondering if they ate from different slots myself.  In my game, they eat from every slot, not just the leftmost first.
The stacking armor thing has been fixed and no longer works
... My friends (4 people) and I have a collective 250ish hours in the game and none of us knew about quick stacking. In fact, two days ago I was literally complaining about this exact thing because I love the game, but I know it's an easy and required thing to implement. I feel stupid
GLITCHES ARE CHEATING. What do you mean? YEAH, if you want to cheat, GO AHEAD. But just know, you ARE cheating. BY D E F I N I T I O N
yeeeeeeea....100+ hours into the game...didnt know about the quickstack xD
Number 2 is cheesing it.  Nothing better than the satisfaction of catching a high level pal with your wit and luck.
I didnt know the stacking in chest tip too T...T
The people that don't want to use glitches and cheats are not the same people that gatekeep. It's perfectly reasonable to want something with training wheels, but you can't be surprised when others suggest making the game a challenge at the most normal level.
2:58 - be careful putting things that are crafting components in your locked chests. Even if locked, workstations in that base will still pull items out of your chest when someone crafts a recipe that uses them.  *This includes the statue.*  So things like souls, ancient parts, etc, are NOT safe in your locked chest.
I didn’t think I would ever see the day Owen Wilson did YouTube videos on Palworld.
Blaming cheaters = gatekeeping. What a joke.
Another good tip as far as perishable food goes is you can reset their timers any time you hit sort in storage or inventory. So you can make perishables last forever if you remember to maintain it that way. But any food you have on your characters feed bag slots need to be put into your actual inventory then hit sort for it to reset the timer. It's been a lifesaver for me on keeping food from rotting when my pals bug out and don't go to my coolers
You can quickly organize your inventory/boxs/palbox by selecting the "sort" option in the top right
The quick stack is crazy… I’ve been manually transferring the items since day 1 😭
Why are all ytuber doing the same video. Is this just a copy/paste clickbait bot mafia?
I can’t imagine the pain of not knowing about the quick stack button 😭
The Boss Base trick just blew mt friggin mind. Sharing this immediately in Discord..
Man, can anyone do a tips video without spoiling tons of cool stuff that shows up later in the game in the intro?
4:18 for me it's different lol I know about quick stacking at level 1, but didn't know i can just press y to put a item into a chest slot, and had to move my controller's cursor to the item and the chest slot i wanted to use XD
SAN is short for Sanity...
How are these advanced tips? Anubis is a way better miner than the digtoise
Dont use digtois use astegon they do way more damage
The final tip at 15:45 has been patched (kind of) in the latest update. But if you managed to have stuff equipped before the update you can still keep them in your inventory slots.
WHAT THE HELL THERES A QUICK STACK
was curious about the armor thing, its fixed on pc at least. also the item stack....level 37....wtf lol
Poison, fire, and frozen also help with capture rates. Poison crossbow does enough damage to poison pal's right away, and if you do it from the back of a mount that gives you fire or electric damage, you can easily apply 2 status effects to really boost your chance.
@SwanyPlaysGames the SAN points are Sanity
i didnt know about the quick item sorting either😅
yooo quick stacking realy got me there too!
Thanks for the video! As of 2-1-2024, the accessory glitch was fixed.
I’m level 23 and I didn’t know about the quick stack button lol
SAN = Sanity. So you can just say their sanity not their SAN
armor stack gone lol
Best tip video I’ve seen yet. Lots of great stuff here. Thanks for putting this together.
TIP : the best way to mine is to take Lily's Spear, hold attack and spam crouch to cancel attack animation and mine the ore in a few seconds only.
When you said press the subscribe button. The button gave me a lightning
Made 10k cooked eggs and every time I'm back at base I hit sort to refresh timers, also keep 75 in coolers doing the same, never have to worry about food bc I have so much and putting 50 -60 in feed box at a time is more than enough
Hit sort in your inventory and it'll refresh all the timers on perishable items 🤑
use a rushboar for mining, pimp him up to 3-4 stars, leveling him , any charge attack  mining a full Ore or Stone Vein
80 hours, didn't know about the auto stacking either 🤦‍♂️  Great tip on the feedbox, didn't realize they would fall back to cooler of it's full will make getting milk and eggs much easier
Is it a glitch or a happy occidental bullet jump?
Biggest help was learning wtf the quick stack button did.. I asked like 5 people and no one knew now I can spread the help to my friends thanks :)
feel better ive been playing s week just the same and didnt know xD
Since you threw a glitch in the last spot im surprised you didnt talk about pal sphere launching.  For those wondering, next time you catch a pal climb on top of the ball. You're gonna want a glider first...
Oh my god, WTF quickstacking! I never knew that was a thing. This will help so much!
Trey sliding down a hill and then jumping and gliding. Much faster and less jank than the grapple hook technique
I just found the quick stack 3 days ago you're not alone brother
Bro, you save lifes! You save lives!
pls for afk mining (not at the mining base) DONT use digtoise, the devs tried to fix them and buff them buuuuut they're still broken AF when not at the base. use lower lvl miner or otther lvl 3 miner. even any other lvl2 miner will prob be better. (Yes the buddy skill with headband is good af for mining but dont put them in ur base, they just steal ur food and do nothing at all)
Your secret room trick won't work. The security code doesn't prevent items from being pulled at work stations.
???????????????????????????????????????????  You guys do know there's mining picks in the game right? It just strikes me as odd because this si the second video to mention the digtoise mining issue - and Asmongold also uses the Digtoise to mine.  Use a fucking mining pick axe?????? I understanding having Sl*ves do everything for you is cool. Super cool. Why would I sit there for 15 minutes while an animal tries to mine a rock that I can do in 4 swings though?  It's literally like.. whack whack whack whack - done. mining pick axe >>>>> all mining pokemon. WTF are you guys doing?
could you please not spoil legendaries in the first 20 seconds? god damnit ...
I'm the same as you about that RB srack.lol😂😂😂😂
Quick stack
The glitch at the end was the icing on the cake thanks I had a good laugh too 😅
I just started playing a few days ago and didnt lnow any of these. 😂 Thank you so much!!
tks for making me save hours :p
I've heard digtoise are glitched right now, so I would recommend using a different mining pal, I have a bunch of bats and penkings at my mining base and I am getting 1000s when I log on
btw SAN stands for sanity, it's a stat seen in some games out there. It's easier to call it sanity instead of SAN I think
Pro tip: to catch a black marketeer, set a pal to attack aggressively then quickly open the marketeer interactionenu before your pal attacks and he won't aggro, but will just take damage from the pal until it's low health
WHAT QUICK STACK?! HOW DID I NOT NOTICE YOU JUST SAVED ME.
It's even faster to glide using a Galeclaw. You just need the glove for it.
Thanks for the advice
For the glider one same mechanic works if ur sliding down a slope and jump once collect enough momentum and toss glider sling shot short distances if u haven't unlocked grapple yet
Nice guide, pretty much sharing these videos with all my discord server cause basically everyone plays it... really appreciate the videos, helped me out alot
I love pokePalmonworld
11 seconds in and I already learned something. THEY ADDED A FIGHTER JET IN THE FORM OF A PAL!
Had to click off at 13:20. Wait until you have a wife and children. Then, this will just be stupid.
Just throwing from behind gives an advantage, so does remaining health.
Armor glitch has been fixed already
bruh that armor glitch allows you to wear whatever helmet you want and still get the stat bonus from a helmet if you so choose. God damn
15:17 Soo… initially i didnt know different areas were meant for different player levels so i wandered out of the 1-15 to the 20-30 when i was only like level 2 & got JUMPED by  the pokemon there… it took me an HOUR trying to stealth my way back & get all my stuff from my corpse drop 😅💀 & get back out of that area hahah
Biggest tip of your life. Download an extra base mod. Plop down a few extra bases. Delete the mod. And all the bases run perfect in game. You can bypass the hard limit of 3 and still turn off mods XD its great. I have about 5 bases to covered all the continents.
First useful video I’ve seen bout this game
quick stack 💀
The gliders in the game aren’t that good get a pal as your glider it’s better than any of them and it’s useful in combat get it with swift and it’s gonna go fast. I don’t know why nobody is talking about it?
Armor glitch just got patched today.
Quick stack bro. Thank you 😂
The quick stack button, is a revelation, thank you.
bruh should consider changuin the video name to 12 basic, cuz i swear theres no advanced tip here. gimme my time back 😭😭😭😭
My pals only eat berries and they are chilling. Only time they get messed up is when they get stuck.  Also you can reset your food timers by going into a box and "sorting" your inventory. It works as of right now on Xbox.
Yeah it took me watching a youtube video to learn about quick stack ngl
Once youre able to build the big comfy pal bed you dont need to feed them anything else than berries, they heal and never get depressed having those beds out. Have 3 bases, 15 pals and comfy beds, no depressed or injured pals
(For the secret room you can access chests through walls so you may want it in the middle and not right up against a wall.)
Lowkey didn’t even peep the quick stack button I’m not even gon lie to you 🤷🏾‍♂️
✨ Quick Stack
the second tip won't work. Even if you lock it the base WILL use the contents for crafting or upgrading.  Stun baton tip is also BS since I've had pals escape plenty of times even though the percentages were 70-95. Having a pal jump out of a hyper sphere at 93% makes you question life. Point is, just have enough spheres.  Mining tip is also pretty wack. Pals have enough trouble properly transporting stuff as is so more ore won't help unless you want to constantly mine every rock manually.
I got to level 40 before knowing you could quick stack items in chests... so thank you 😂
I figured out on the base loading and render issue topic *   If you happen to have a second console or computer , doesn’t have to be next gen . Load in to your game via invite code on the second unit , and leave him posted at the base you want the work / breeding to not be interrupted on , and it will stay rendered and avoid a lot of interruptions .
The best part about the last glitch is that swapping the glider with armor doesn't stop you from gliding. Instead, you just t-pose through the air. I used a broken cloth armor set on our multiplayer world so I wouldn't get a stat boost, but could still be their new god
moar!
Dropping your pal also resets your pals skill so if you use it up drop them and pick them up it’ll refresh the skill. Do what you will with that knowledge.
Don't worry, I didn't know about Quick Stack either!  Thank you!  And how did you get so many ancient civilization parts!?
Keep making palworld content I’ll stick around 👌🏾
Palpedia is straight up cheating
digtoise is a terrible miner. in base, pals attack the rocks and each attack does 'damage' to the rock based on mining lvl, (not related to actual damage numbers as far as i can tell) Digtoises attack animation is extremely long.  dumud, penglord, and especially anubis are far better. for mining by hand, Rushoar is better. condensing a bunch of rushoar makes their reckless charge attack kill rocks in only a few hits.
I have over 4 days of hours and never knew about quick stack
Don’t feel bad about 60 hours in I realized there was a “build consistently” button.
I haven't tried it with my captured Cawgnito, but I noticed after eliminating a thug base, a few of them came around and ate the corpses 😂. When I play tonight, I'll try it with my captured one if I get raided. Good way to get rid of corpses after a raid if it works.
Yeah, I didn't know about the quick stack either 😂 cool video
On the PC you just need to right click items to move them in stacks. You don't have to hit R =)
The climbing through stairs trick also works with slanted roof
imagine cheesing palworld LMAO
100+hrs into this game and I didn't know about Quick Stack either.... fml
There are pals that increase your weigth limit like Lunaris, Broncherry etc when in your party and it stacks additatively
the base outside the boss thing is so cheese, how to ruin the game 101, what a bad video of usless tips
15:50 Game has roll mechanic. Souls players "git gud" gatekeeping
It’s too bad the “hidden chest” in your guilds base still let others use any consumables stored. My buddy just demolishing ingot and gunpowder reserves just wondering where all those mats were coming from lol.
11:00 Digtoises are bugged rn, i swear 3 tombats are better than 3 digtoises for auto mining in your base!
the damn wheat...
4:25... I don't understand how so many people consider a UI element a tip let alone an "advanced tip", that is one control that is up on screen every single time you are in a box that holds items. A better tip there should have been to point out that quick stack does not  combine split stacks in the box while sort does combine them  and so if you use single items like coins to block inventory spots so that your pals always bring the same items to the same locations by having no free inventory sports if you need to have the box auto sort to be prepared to reblock to inventory slots so you don't end up with your ores or wood in 5 different boxes hard to find because the pals are lazy and just take items to the closest box regardless if there is a clear box meant for certain materials.
Your inventory tip is going to help me a LOT!
Sanity...it's sanity for SAN
if you have to create a secret room because you are in a guild etc.... you definitly need to leave that shit guild of people who cant be trusted....simple...
so one half is glitches and the other half spoilers and third party tools. not exactly what i would imagine when looking for tips if i was new to this game.
For some weird reason, pressing “sort” on your inventory or even the feed box inventory will refresh duration for the food spoilage. Food will last longer esp if you have a fridge
I’m only 7 minutes into the video and it’s very clear and good advice so far but one thing I’d like to add about how to correctly order your food is that when you’re in fights it’s hard to gain that health back as you need to enter your inventory at early stages to eat food and gain energy to replenish; what you can do is store the food in the first slot of your inventory leading you to only need to press your inventory button and spam use and eat as many as you need in a quick succession and get back into the fight; I usually create some distance using a rock between me and the boss or pal that is kicking my ass and using this as a simple way too get back into the fight knowing I’m gain some hp as I keep moving and evading attacks
That fast glide trick, better off using pals glider, theres on that glide as fast and almost horizontal. Looks cooler and just use one hand so the other hand is free to hold a machine gun.
Hidden room tip is abit suspicious when your guild mate sees you climbing through your walls 😂😂
You move a full stack of stuff on PC by right clicking the stack of items you wanna move or ctrl + left click. You dont press R and never have? Where did you get that lie from? :)
BTW these were the best tips so far I've seen online
I've been thoroughly enjoying this game
11:00 Digtoise is currently bugged and  thats why they dont mine well when assigned to a base. Good tip to get by until its fixed! And no I didn't know about the R key to auto stack items in storage boxes so you can feel better.
11:00 instead of using Digtoise for mining try using Rushboar's "Reckless Charge" it instantly mines any ore.
Trick #3 gets replaced with a PASSWORD CHEST. why take the extra step? XD
I've played for almost a week, I didnt know about quick stack.....
Just right click forehead, use r 😂
i knew about R lmao, but my 2 friends i play with, i assumed they knew so i never told them... and just last night they told me about it like it was some hot new thing lmao. i been doin it ever since the first day i been playing since i noticed the words down below xD was like, Wait you didnt know about that?¿? xDDD
Tbh most of these tips are just for lazy people. People these are to damm lazy with gaming. What the fun in gaming ive your not explore it yourself 🤷‍♂️
The stun/no stun image was more to do with back-attack bonus than stun. Stun does basically nothing since it usually does not last long enough to count.
Well, there was a lot new stuff for me… appreciate your video! Keep going my friend ❤❤❤
As if Owen Wilson plays Palworld. Wow.
In regards to that last glitch, it could also be used as a sort of bootleg layered/cosmetic armor. You'd still be getting higher stats than just 1 set of armor, but if you like the look of another set you could wear that in the primary slot. Cosmetic stuff like that is something I'm really hoping for in the future.
3:03 If you need to hide items from you frinds they probebly arent your frinds!
THANK YOU for the quick stack tip, damn that was a headache. I’m used to harvest moon / animal crossing level inconvenience so never even considered there would be an option. Also I can’t see any of the tiny ass directions on my tv
You can slide and then jump to get a slide boost too if your not near any edges or don’t have the grapple gun yet
Geeeez thanks ! The stairs and food tips
Is this Owen Wilson?
It's Not stability it's sanity
To be honest, why do people max lvl a game preview? Full release things are gonna get changed and the experience wouldn’t be as fun as the first time right?
i tried several official multiplayer servers, it's full of cheaters. sad and disappointment..
I'm level 20+ and never bought the shield. I thought it was for my base and didn't think I needed it. Just thought the battles were tough.
Equipment stacking has effectively made the health stat more useless than the attack stat.   I'm all for it for the time being. It's just REALLY busted, but a lot of this game is currently busted. The fact you can build a base on top of a scripted encounter area and 2 Mammorest can just suddenly bombard your entire base anytime you show up is hilarious and maddening.
12:00  you can just swing your refined metal pickaxe 7 times an finnish most stacks faster than digtoise.....so if your in that said bind for ore. its faster to just mine it yourself..... esp with a pal in your party that has a player mining buff by 20%
Instead of the stun baton, use posion/fire arrows.  Same deal, although you do have to worry a little about the pal dying to the DOT.  Thing is the arrows only require 1 shot to activate status, and you don't have to get off your mount or walk up to a hostile pal.  Just quickly switch, shoot, and then throw.
10:00  you can only do this if you have changed the player stamina in the settings. even with 20 points in stamina, you lose stam so fast gliding, youll fall and take dmg or even die if high enough, which isnt very high tbh. and running 20 stam points isnt advised. atleast this is my experience playing on hard.
I didn’t know about pressing the R key to transfer similar types. Hell, I played for about 20 hours before I noticed you can press C and dismantle stuff 😂
8:35 im about 120+ hrs in, ive never fed pals anything other than cooked berries. if they end up incapacitated, they go in the box for 10 mins.  not crafted or used a single medicine.
Oh my god the QUICK STACKKK!!!!
wow i dont have to add to freezer the pals will no way?!🤔
You’re character looks like darkness from konosuba :) nice vid champ
Thumbs up man! Most helpful, God bless! 🙏
RB helped me!
The 5x custom multiplier 🥲
I only watched about 2 minutes and idk I like what ya got going on. Thanks for not holding all the secrets. Subscribed
A safer way to trade pals or share them for the paldeck by putting them in your village and having them put it in their box.
lol why would u hide a chest if you can put a fucking password on it? Smfh
So it's pokemon Minecraft fortnite? Why would you even give your time to something so blatantly uninspired?
Hahahaha my actual first base is set up right next to king paca it has a ton of syone and is next to where the rare pal.guy spawns and im able to farm king paca 2hen i hatch new eggs which typically brings the newly hatched pal up to level 19 after two paca kills.....but be careful with campfires bc they set paca on fire and he will stroll thru your camp and set everything on fire 😂   Another thing to consider is building campfire traps for pals that are stronger then your team...build the fires near trees and then lure the pal into the trees they will get stuck and catch fore and then if you have a team of daedreams they will attack the overpowered pal while its stuck in the trap you lured them into
For anyone with younger kids trying out pal workd dor the 1st time go ahead and take about 30 minutes while theyre asleep and cut down trees and accumulate stone for them.....just build a box and fill it slap full of resources for them this will grant you nap time while theyre playing and orevent a million questions about why they cant build xyz😂
I didn't know about the quick stack option either until last night. When a friend on my server told me. So I decided to share with my guild mate tonight and he just said oh I thought you knew that alreadt
Better advice for you kill the black market dealer get paid 35,000 gold and get a couple gold keys as the 5 of them respawn quiet frequently now you can buy unlimited ammo up to assault rifle ammo and things like bones, or high quality pal oil from the red and green vendors (which you the one of each at you base) so instead of wasting mats on crafting ammo or farming specific pals for one item you can focus on filling you pal-deck catching all 10 of each pals for bonus exp and getting the right qualities to breed then star and stat up your strongest pals. Don't forget campfires and ice blocks increase the eggs speed timers depending on the type of egg in the incubator. - level 50 with all pals and legendaries including a 4 star jet dragon with muscle head (bc ferociousthe tier 3 onoy gives +20% while muscle head gives 30%), divine dragon, legend and lucky  for a whopping 60% to all attack and an extra 20% to dragon attack so my jet dragon has +80% attack power from passives alone not to mention condenser power up with pal souls
Also, nobody talks about this but if you are sprinting on an incline you can get some good speed if you crouch while sprinting, you'll slide like a madman! Also preserves momentum when jumping and hitting the glider. You can also attack and throw spheres while sliding, it's a game changer for me, doding stuff is easier etc.
I didn’t now that the was a stack thing lol
If you drop your pal then pick it up it resets your pal’s passive cooldown (for example infinite Teafant healing).
i learned pretty much thanks!but i wanna say the electrocute helps with capturing because status effects over all help with capturing also throwing the ball from behind the pal will help giving a better rate :)
6:21 WTF! 0.0
Useless to make a secret chest because items pull when crafted 💀💀💀
Thanks for the tip !! I didnt even know you could press R to quick store and Im level 40 😂
Thanks for the video
For that grapple glider glitch, you go probably 5x faster if you slide downhill and then glide instead of grapple
in your stun section, you show a before and after.  In the before you are attempting to capture from the front, and the after your capturing from behind.  There is a significant base bonus capturing from behind
I didn't know about the quick stack either. Thanks a lot.
Its pretty weird that the pals dont mine when you're not around, which is kind of the point of having a mining outpost. Hope they fix that.
Exploits you didn't know basically. What an awful way to play a game
*Advanced Tips:*  “Quick stacking, press 1 button”
I've been moving things 1 at a time for like 200 hours.... LB button. What.
Ragnahawk was a major boost. Dude made so many cakes for me
Oh my god thanks for this stacking storage Tip i also feel stupid Like a Rock i havent Seen this before 😄😄
Digtoise is bugged and doesnt work properly when hes assigned to a base, the rest of the miners work as intender
YOU CAN QUICKSTACK??????
Medicine? Lol I've been putting old Sally down😮😅
Oh man I love quickstacking! I've been dropping everything and letting pals deliver things for me.
That last armor glitch is legit and it does make you stupid. Tanky and I haven't even maximized the effect yet. Imagine if you did all legendary armors of the highest grade But at the very least, this glitch is a lovely way for you to go out and catch a bunch of s*** that shouldn't be a challenge, but with enough of them attacking you might kill you even though they shouldn't be able to kill you. This takes all of the effort out of that and you just walk in there like a tank and capture everything. I was even tanking level 45s
scrolled a bit and didnt see this mentioned, but the reason the mammorest catch% went up so much was due to you aiming at its butt after shocking it. The shocking did some to increase it but the bulk was from just aiming at its ass.. Pretty crazy how big of a difference it is between aiming at the front or side vs aiming at the back.
Digtoise is only good in party sadly as an active miner,as a passive auto miner he is trash.
another tech i discovered with the grappler is that it can be used even when over encombered so you dont have to make multiple trips back and forth
Also, if your food is about to expire in the cooler box or inventory, take everything out of the cooler box and put it in your inventory and then put it right back in the cooler box and it will be full time again.
Some useful tips in here!  I'll be doing some of this. As for Sanity, you can also just give your Pals better beds.
Lvl 40 here - the stack tab option is literally game changing. I, like you, have apparently kept reading over it without realizing what it does. I could hug you right now
I didnt know about the R key. 😅 Will make dropping off my stuff lots easier lol. Feel like a noob.  The glitches, not going to try but the tips were nice to hear ❤  Another glitch... sort the inventory and food expire time refreshes lol.  Wont work on feed bag, but u can move it to inventory, sort, move back and full timer again. I found out about it on accident.
Watching your vid is cool but just the idea of what you said about feeding made me mentally exhausted.  That's the same reason I quit Pokemon every step someone jumps out let's battle, you have to talk to every mpc. Now I have to feed all these pals. What have I got myself into? My head hurts😩
Jam filled buns :D
I just want a false swipe move!
These are exploits rather than tips. You'll ruin the game for yourself long term if you try and glitch your way to the endgame
Jam filled buns I have found to be the best food to make when it comes to cost to effect. Having a few wheat fields and berry fields is super easy to maintain.
Thank you for the quality of life storage I had no idea either
Never played a survival game in my life. I'm 40 yrs old and always played fps games. Palworld is Hella fun
Why not just put a lock...
Some interesting tips, but I think I would avoid about half of these for the sake of longevity and the feeling of earning things.
Glider super fast and a pal with glider extends the stamina
Thanks Owen Wilson
thank you so much for that info on food with San + on it.. not sure how i didn't notice that, my pals kept getting stressed, and i'm thinking they have hot tubs and nice beds,   stop stressing out..  (i even had one that it said was developing an eating disorder due to stress)  guess, berries, raw eggs and wheat is not good enough, so i'll cook up a stack of foods next time.  catching merchants is funny.. but i really don't think it's worth it, you can easily travel to them once you know where they are, there is multiple of them, so you could just check each of them to find the rarer pals to buy.   having them at your base means you need to switch out a pal,  put in the merchant shop, then put the pal back out..  IF you could catch them really early sure, but they level 40+,  easier to just travel to them. as for the glitch at the end..  you can just change the world settings to make "player damage"  super high, and "player damage received"  super low...   you can basically just tweak the settings to nearly god mode...  weaken pals,  strengthen your defense and attack,  double the catch rate,  more drops, greatly reduced (if not completely zero) stamina drain, hunger drain.. increase regen, etc..   honestly the amount you can change difficulty is way way overpowerd if you actually use it.    (and yes you can change the settings on an existing game from the load screen)
I don't know if they patched it already but if you press the "sort" button in any inventory, the spoil timers reset
I wish we could move our characters to different servers.
So... did you know you can press RS to sort your stuff?
"And then you gotta go and make a ton of medicine"  Not in my sweatshop. These MF already know aint no medical benefits or workman's comp in GumDrop Industries. Straight to the carpet you go... 🔪  Fyi there's a carpet in a certain room where I take "employees" to "release" them from their duties. Cuz only in death does our duty end.  Iykyk lol
The boss fight tip earned a like.  The quick stack blew my mind lol  They earned you the sub. Keep up the great work. Hope to see more from you in the future 🫡👍💯
Great video, definitely learned some things that I haven’t seen yet! Thanks for sharing. 😊
I feel so dumb for not noticing the Quick Move button. Thank you for showing us these tips
I cant imagine why people wouldnt want you to spread how to exploit a glitch, crazy. And teaching how to exploit a glitch isn't a tip, its just cheating...
I ran into thesame issue mining but notied my rock mine area was glitching and never got past 2 rock and kept resetting so i built a new one worked fine
Overwolf has a nice map integration that can be shown in-game or onto a second monitor. Just search Overwolf Palworld
that are infact good tipps
Love the Grapple technique. Batman Arkham games prepared me for that.
thank you owen wilson for the tips 🙌🏼
Great information 10/10
Also didn’t know about the quick stack till you said so 😂
You are over complicating things. Feed them all the berries you want just build a  hot spring 😂
Digtoise is bugged. They can't mine effectively when assigned to bases but do fine when in your party.
One tip I have that I came up with when I ran out of oil repeatedly and was always scavenging for the mammoths: Instead of killing the mammoths, capture them. You can breed or butcher them. If you butcher them, they'll give you twice the resources, once for capturing them and again when you butcher them. Have one base constantly breed the mammoths and when 5 or more hatch, exchange your party pals for the mammoths, get a cleaver and go to work. You'll get all the oil you want plus lots of high quality meat to cook for you and your base pals.
How did I not notice the quick stack
You can also use Rushoar's special ability to quickly mine nodes. Especially if you can line several nodes up at once. I accidently discovered this when I cleared out three nodes at once and had to drop half of it so I could move again :P
Never knew about the stack button 😞 but I did find trading pals through the pal box works as well. Assign the ones you want to trade to work and your buddy moves it from there.
not a fan of this video as some of these feel they will be patched out and aren't intended game design... maybe, idk, we'll see...
The food storage rotation and cooking tip is the best one
10:12 works with best gliders - pals? (calmari, eagle, hangyou)
Damn I remember watching your battlefront 2 vids back in the day
Yeah they’ll patch that capturing black market dealer lol 😂
Twas video excellent. I do like am very pleased.❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💯🐢
11:14 Its probably a bug so don't assign digtoise on ore base, use tombat(server) or dumud instead.
I also got a tip and trick. If you want to go up a huge mountain and your bird can't fly that high. Jump off and grab the side of the mountain for a few seconds then jump back on your bird. Your bird will have recovered sta and keep going .
You can also sprint and slide and it will not cost stamina instead of dodge rolling to go faster
I got 3 hyper shields, and pal armorer, heat pal armore and cold pal armor all equiped......i no longer get damaged ha sooo O.P but i love it
I have to thank u for Quickstack
RB?!?!😵 Thanks for letting me know! You taught be!
noice info thank you! also ive been using the palworld map too and when i mention it to one of my friend i play on multiplayer, he said im cheating lol. i told him, ''i work smort not hord'' 😊 👌
Great content, lowkey sound like owen wilson
Another funny bug is crouch sliding down hills, gives you huge amounts of momentum which then applies to gliding, may be a bug idk.
digtoise are bad at mining yea they might be bugged or whatever, but you need mine 3 for coal, however catbats are way better at mining ore and you can have a base of them they also carry and collect ore and everything. On pc pal drop does not unlock much, not event he mount item. For the volcano, there are lvl 50 pals that are impossible without also being level 50 so be careful
can someone tell me why it doesn’t let me create a multiplayer world on my xbox one s
Lowkey refined pick does more damage than digtoise. If youre gunna spend the time manually calling him out and then waiting to pick up ore, might as well just mine it urself in 6 swings and save the team slot.
also, pals can be captured easier if u throw the sphere at their back, stun baton + back sphere shot can give a big bonus
The secret room inwould put the box in the middle of the room so you can get the box menu
Thanks! I learned a lot, especially the quick stacking! 🤦🏻‍♂️
On day 30, excited to also use quick stack for the first time lmao
Just found out about the quick stack this morning before watching. Immediately pissed me off, but also a total relief lol
Apex players didn't need this grapple tip xD
another thing you can do to get crazy speed on the glider is to slide down an incline. if you dont know, if you crouch while sprinting, you will slide. its normally pretty useless, but you go really fast when sliding down a slope. if you jump while sliding, you keep that momentum, and same goes for gliding.
I made it to level 26 before realising I had 25 stat points to apply 😂 I was still rocking around with level 1 stats
Subscribed for the quick stack tip.  Rest assured, you're not alone.
Been seeing people lose their MIND when they find out you've put any points into Work Speed. Like straight up just "wow, have fun with your nerfed ass character" "you really handicapped yourself stupid" like... bro, I play with the lowest stamina usage setting. I don't need to put points into Stamina at all with that.
Just had a chicken farming  Eggs mixed with berries job done
Arent hot springs to improve sanity? I only feed my pals berrys ans they never get sick since they have a hot spring.
when i heard quick stack👀👀
I just found out that I'm an idiot stash too.😢 (Updating) be careful not to drop your ammo you are using into the stash
10:35 is this possible with elkydeer. Who’s upper cut is like a dash. I know you can fire grapple hook while mounted. So maybe the dash + grapple speed can give you lots of speed. Might be very mechanical tho
5:04 biggest tip!
Am I the only person that gets triggered by streamers ignoring the "armor is damaged" message
Digtoise is the worst miner for bases. The most efficient way of mining is getting a team full of Mining Foreman and using a pickaxe yourself. with 5 Pals and refined pickaxe you do around 500 dmg to ores per swing. astegon does around 60 I think.
for the feeding bin and cooler, we ran into an issue that the pals were not making more wheat if the food bin was full.  They would not place it in the cooler.  Can you triple confirm that they will carry to the cooler instead of the food bins?  As soon as we made space in the food bins again, wheat production started.  Dunno if its a glitch or not
The game just came out
10:00 I discovered the same thing in the starter area when sliding downhill and then jumping up and starting to glide also gives you crazy momentum.
The best SAN food item is cotton candy, since you dont need to cook it. And a Pal can produce it for free at all times
Reptyro better than digtoise
I paused the video, just to thank you for the quick stacking tip. Nothing is ever a pointless tip! I learned after a week of playing that you can rename Pals ... and i take all tips seriously, nonetheless thanks for all the tips!!!
Dont think its a good idea to listen to a guy about tips that didnt even know about a quick stack button that is said right there on the screen
Quick stack 😅 I just found out with ur video ty
does armor lose durability in accessory slot? may just use it for that alone if it doesn't. they break in like 1 hit. Probably can use it for cosmetic reasons too?
if you run and slide on a hill and use the glider you get a really nice flying boost as well.
I like the game for it's natural effect. Personally I'd like to find all the locations myself for myself. Think it would be a fun experience
question the pal fluid, I need like 10 for the hot tub thing, I had five, now I have 9.  What is the source of the blue liquid in the bottle, please?
R sounds nice, but on the PC I've been using right-click to transfer a stack and if it exists in the chest it stacks it.  Now I don't know how you get 10 stacks of things that stack but I have had many eggs in my backpack not stacked so I will try and recall 'R'.  I just hit level 15 and need to go get my first flying mount, till now I have just been using the glider-type Pal.  I also wish stamina went up way faster because I have very limited range using the glider.  Also, my parachute what a waste of effort, since I never used it since I always have the glider moth, well maybe soon that will change :)
Abusing glitches and exploits is a form of cheating and calling someone a cheater for cheating isn’t gatekeeping lmao.
Clicked off when seeing the first tip, everyone knows you can catch the black market guy and it's a waste to sell your pals, distill them and make op ones
So a tip for base mining use Anubis's they deal about 40 per hit and with about 4/5 in a base they will be able to destroy the entire node set and store it all
Just use palbox for fast travel, bring the mats needed at all times. In the middle of the desert far from a fast travel? Drop a palbox fast travel away and back then destroy it
the chest moving is huuuge
I LOVE PALWORLD BUT DAMN, WAY TOO MANY BUGS ON XBOX VERSION!!??
Honestly, after playing the game over the weekend, Palworld is a lot better then the recent Pokemon games. You don't really have to play through a story that anyone can finish in a few hours to have fun
Honestly, after playing the game over the weekend, Palworld is a lot better then the recent Pokemon games. You don't really have to play through a story that anyone can finish in a few hours to have fun
Whaa I never knew that's what it was for. Quick Stacking from here on out! Thanks for adding that part in
Any tips on when you fall thru the ground?
Your commentary is always so entertaining and informative. Keep up the great work!
I found quick stacking after maybe 20 hours.  The feed box/cooler tips are a game changer for me thank you
I just watched this after watching MortDog's video about how this game is a rip off and wow, this game has a TON of unique mechanics. It's absolutely NOT a ripoff.
I play xbox and this is the first time ive seen the quick move.  Liked and subscribed!!
You had me shook with that quick stacking. I’ve been wasting so much time 😂 Like deserved
For maintaining sanity just make baked berries or cotton candy in mass and when you see someone is upset just bring them into your party and force feed force till there above 90 i.e. one of my miners was upset(40 San) so I grabbed 10 cotton candies from the ranch added them to my party to feed them from the menu(which is a lot easier and faster than having to stock San foods)
its almost completely useless using digtoise in the base, i personally use a bunch of Anubis as they have high mining and transporting
i never paid any attention to the SAN on food but I will now. thanks for the tip
Made a base next to jet dragon at lvl 45 and he wiped my whole team and all of my reserves with 4k hp left...
Yup also didn't know about quick stacking
Brooooo, quick stack is like the first thing I seeeeek! Glad ya found it 😂
tips video consisting of 50% showing off glitches. hot garbage
The higher quality hot springs recovers SAN points fast and having multiple ensures that when multiple pals at your base need more SAN they all have a spring available. I don't feed the special food and I only feed eggs and berries to my pals with no need for medicine.
Quick stack was a really helpful information 😂🎉
just got the game last night, started playing today
I have not known like a single thing you have said! Lol thank you so much!
Dude, the quick stacking.....thank you!
5:00 aaaaahhh I hate myself for being blind too
The Digtoise one doesn't make sense as you'd think the base Digtoise would mine more efficiently instead of grinding out 1 dmg per hit. I've seen lower mining lvl Pals deal more dmg to the rocks. Must be a bug that needs fixing.
Wow quick slot... who would have thought 😭😭😭😭 so much time waisted
Thought this was Owen Wilson’s YouTube channel😂
The Game kinda Boring its just not Pokemon
Digtoise is good at mining rock but worthless for ore
Holy shit the quick stacking... those options don't even appear on my screen, but I've been doing them one stack at a time too... fuck me.
I didn't know about the Black Marketeer's resetting like that, pretty nice tip. I have a handful of merchants to buy medicine, buy food ingredients for quick meals (lettuce takes way too long to harvest), buy ammo, and to sell/pay pals.   For gliding, I have been sliding down a slope then gliding for speed but the grapple method might be more applicable.  In regards to mining ore, I like to think Digtoise assigned at base are bugged and deal 1 damage a tick causing them to be much slower. Anubis (breed Relaxasaurus + Celeray) are pretty good end goal miners as they can mine it more efficiently, eat a lot less than Digtoise, have a high handiwork skill, and have the transporting skill.
Been playing for days (world day 150ish) and you get a like just for the quick stacking... I also didn't know it existed  Cotton candy is what I've found is easiest to farm, increases san, and never expires 😁
Digtoise is bugged when he's assigned to base where he deals one dmge per tick instead of normal domage, until they patch that it's better to not use digtoise in a "Base".
Here’s a tip for mining, dedicate an hour or two to manually doing it. I use rushoar because it’s way faster than digtoise. If you have a free base slot use that as a portable fast travel spot and wherever you have spots with ore that you like, build a chest and store your items while farming. Then when you have enough of what you want just head back to each spot, throw down the pal box, load up and fast travel to your main base. This helps a lot when on a private server and the pals don’t work unless you’re online
Yeah, Digtoise seems bugged when assigned to your base.  It's better to stack your base slots with Anubis instead.  You can still keep Digtoise in your Party and throw it at a clump of ore to have it mine at full speed when you're present. Nice trick with the Grapple and Glider; most other vids just mention the downhill sliding technique with the Glider.
The game was released TEN days ago and people are already making "advanced tips" videos. 😂😂😂Ridiculous.
Oh my god there’s a quick stack button
it's so cringe how these gamer content creators always seem to make a female character. It's just so creepy how prevalent it is
Be careful dropping pals, people can buy dropped pals from the black market dealer.
Implementing pvp is going to be tough when there’s glitches like your armor stacking tip.
The Feed Box mechanic was one that I had been wondering about for a couple days, but never got around to testing.  Thanks a ton for doing the legwork and putting the info out there.
I didnt know about quick stacking to chest either as a level 35 until i read it on reddit yesterday at 3 am 😃
Don’t forget about the Digtoise head band
can i get the location  at this timestamp 11:16
130 hours in and didn’t realize I could quick move items in my inventory. Don’t feel bad.
I didn't realize I could push Y I was scrolling over Drop items in chests.
Damn, literally every single tip was really helpful, that's the first palworld video, where that happened. Thank you!
Not the first time I didn't know about an option that was plainly and obviously on the screen, so don't feel bad
Love the tips but has anyone told you, you kinda sound like lightning McQueen 😂
Finaly, some real advanced stuff and tips,  thank you! But fast stack - lmao =)
Lol after 150 hrs in palworld i did not know about quick stacking 😂
So helpful, definitely helped me with my feed box, all my pal were getting sick and honestly I don’t know how to use medicine on them.
Does anyone know how to put the pal base computer on foundations? I wanted to build a giant factory with it inside but I can’t seem to find a way to put it on foundation
See theres glitches that ruin a game and then there glitches that can make the game more fun for people. The armor glitch is one that makes it more fun. Unless you came across this by accident and not by trying to do this. If you tried, i argue that means the average player wont accidentally find it meaning it is a choice to do it or not.
I play on single player hard mode and never heal pals. Just put them in the Pal box for awhile and it will fix them good as new. No need for medicine. Great video and I feel equally slow for not noticing the stack option 😆 TY
You can also use your spear or sword to mine ores and chop trees
me : there is a quick stack button?????????????????
I really wish they'd give an additional base or two for single guilds of 12-15 people. Instead of gating to 3. Or having to split the guild because of lack of materials.
OMG RB the whole time to move my items?? THANK YOU
Thank you for all the support on this video! This is officially my fastest growing video EVER on YouTube. I wasn't expecting so many of you to have missed the Quick Stacking like I did lol Thanks for watching <3
I know a quick level up glitch where you can fly to the lvl 50 grunts areas. Let them spot you, have a bird type pal and fly super high, make sure to have some kind of bomb blast attack and attack them while they spawn behind you, and theyll die from fall damage and boom, easy leveling up. Just make sure not to be so low so they dont one shot you
Commenting for the quick stack tip! 🤯
Cooking berries by the thousands gave me levels of exp. Always cook until the last of the you won't need any other food and will passively net you mountains of exp
Not sure if it's just me or a wide known glitch but I've realized by hitting the sort button, any perishable foods in my inventory refreshes. Same thing for any food stored in containers.
I didn't know that you can just stack all good to know thank you 😁
I had no idea about the quick stack ugh!!!! Thank you!
Everything this funny Pal telling and explaining, I find out by myself. I think it's because I am not stupid. So this video shows nothing new and there are also no "secret tricks". If you're not totally stupid (like the funny Pal) you will find out everything by yourself. The intention of videos like these are not to help you, it's all about the clicks and the attention by making BIG Science out of things which are no science at all. Funfact: I've found a real secret and really no one has found that out. And I will not telling you :) Cheers.
So, something about the cooler box that I didn't see mentioned in the video. The description in the tech menu does say that the cooler keeps food from spoiling too quickly, but it does require a pal with a cooling ability to keep it cold to increase the spoil timers of the food. So make sure if you have pals delivering food to the cooler that you have a pal assigned to it to actually make it work.  As for the digtoise issue, yeah, don't use digtoise for regular ore deposits passively in your base. It's great for personal use, but in your base use a different pal like reptyro for base mining. Made a big difference for my ore and coal mining bases so now when I go to the base after a while they will already have a bunch of ore or coal on the ground for me to collect.   But definitely take a personal digtoise with you when you go mining by yourself instead of using a pickaxe. And make sure you condense them to at least level 3 partner skill. They will chew through mining deposits in seconds.
A san hottub and berries  work fine 4 my pals
Wait but that quick stack tip is a serious game changer that's so much better haha
One niche tip I've learned is use the sorting button in the inventory to reset food timers. It'll likely be patched but it's saved me some of my higher tier food until I could use it.
You really don't want to use the graple glider trick into trees, bonking into them and ricochet off to the side loses like 70% of your momentum if not more.
Shook Im just finding out about quick stacking
Super Advanced Tip!  SAN is sanity. Not Es-Ay-En. SANity.
And he's passing the knowledge on to YOOOOUUUUUU
Facepalming myself while watching this because i didnt know about the quick stack and I sorted the base today
...almost 100 hours...and I just learned about "r" quick stacking from the video. So -- thank you, you were not alone.
bruv sounds like owen wilson
or right click on mouse  for the moving item thing
Once you get it down your gonna come back and thank me later. Dude im thanking you NOW lmfaoooo😂😂😂 thank youuuuu❤ its tulins ability from totk in palworld😂
I didn't know about the quick stack either and I'm lv46 on mine and 49 on my friends! I appreciate the tip!
Another tip for faster gliding is to slide down a hill, jump and immediately pull your glider. you’ll go way farther
Great vid! Def deserves a sub!
Too bad most of these are based off RL animals which means obviously it's going to make sense why there are similar ideas. Also the colors matching wouldn't be much of a shock, plants / grass types being green... wow wonder why anyone would think that. On another note this NEVER would have been an issue if Nintendo didn't always pretend we the players don't know what we want. People have been begging for an MMO style pokemon etc and instead we get the same copy paste games with maybe a spin on a previous mechanic like... megas...gmax...terrastrial. You are a multi billion dollar company but instead of being brave and taking the plunge, you want to continue pushing out the same game since 1996 with just better graphics. Even the pokemon are beginning to become copies of themselves. You have nearly 1k mons you could do WONDERS with if you opened up to an actual MMORPG that included all regions etc, but let's be real, Nintendo will never put the money towards being brave anymore. Creativity feels like it has died for them and they are always just releasing the next carbon copy franchise they have had since the 80-90s. Indie games are going to end up what dominate the market because their creativity into delving into what AAA companies won't do, and they even love getting feedback and improving their games.
Thank you for the quick stack tip. Y button needs a break 😂
How'd I not know about quick stack? Thank you!!
Woah. I did not know about Quick stacking! 😱 That’s so helpful! Thank you!
I was doing the same thing with my inventory storage 😂😂 saved my life man, thank you!
That’s kinda weird I recently moved base to a beach and I haven’t gotten raided and my pals have not gotten sick at all besides get upset
make salads guys, tomatoes and lettuce don't have any other utility
The quick stack was very helpful
The turtles seem to be broken for mining afk, i switched them with level 2 miners who do one hit at the time and I started getting way more ore the turtles, the turtles only hit the ore for like 15 dmg when you add up all the 1s and the other pals can go from 20 - 40 in one hit which seems to do all the difference.
Probably going to regret sharing this but.... If you play dedicated servers and another guild has a starving pal and is losing health, throw a sphere at it and you capture it 😂
I've been feeding my pals berries from the start and have never once had them get sick/injured/depressed. I haven't changed any world settings and I'm on normal. Anyone have any idea why my pals are just vibin all the time? I'm not complaining, since having to make medicine for them would get annoying quickly.
I can understand why people don't like the exploits though. The game is already multiplayer, and PvP is coming
Bro I had no idea about the quick-stack button option on the inventory screen. You just made my life a million times easier!
Utilizing sliding is nice too
great video. thank you for all the helpful info <3
Digtoise is bugged. Doing 32 nods a day, vs a normal 3 mining that does 100+
anyone else hearing dicktoise? lol
This game would be fun, if they didn’t continuously wipe the official servers. I’ll play the game when they both fix the servers and at least tell their player base when the wipes will be.
the digtoise are just bugged atm
Nice
You can also assign a pal to a base for your friend to take it from there
So all pals eat the same food. None are like herbivores or carnivores?
Thank you for the time stamps!
Or you can build a hot spring, and not do the cooler.
More like exploits, not tips
- For glider glitch: you can use Galeclaw, it glide faster than a glider could. - For mining ore : you can use Mamorest ( if you can ) for a wider range of "mining". - Trading Pals with friend: just tell them to release that pal into base then you can get it from base instead of dropping it on the ground.
I definitely didn't know about the quick stack transfer and I'm level 29 lol.  A tip for mining ore I use often; the Desolate Church spawn point has at least 7 ore deposits in the back.  I mine each ore, and whenever I am encumbered I hop on Direhowl and use it's dash attack to get to the next ore rock.  Repeat until I've mined all ores, which is about 10 minutes, and then ride Direhowl back to the teleporter.  I get 320 ore in 8 minutes every time
Wait so we’re calling pressing the quick stack button advanced tips lol. Everything else was pretty valuable info tho
😂 better off having a pw protected room in a "guild hall" than try and have a secret room, still fun to make though
i have the issue that fire pals dont work in my base. any tips?
The fact  that both of your tips and tricks videos put a bug in  the "tips" is astonishing.  When did people lose integrity? A bug or glitch in the game shouldnt be consider a trick. Its not intended and just because its there doesn't mean use it. Just shows you cut corners when you can.
Yam. Actually good tips in a tip video, this is unheard of.
I've been having problems with mining too. The turtles should clear the area in minutes but end up doing nothing but eating. Also, I can't figure out if there's a way to get pals to prioritize ore and coal over the stone quarry.
Safer way to gift pals to buddies is putting that pal to work and let your buddy take it from the worker group
that glider trick 👌👌👌.  F*k yes, palpedia is a game changer.
IDK WTF they were thinking when making the guild system. Until they make the pal box have tabs and options so guild can see and take use pals playing with the wife has no real point. Would like to work /play with her not just have her on the server. The pal box is already a nightmare to find anything fast if have more then 5 or so of the same pal, yes can rename but would be better if could add little icons to their icons so you know right away out of the 20 of this pals i have of this one type This is the one i want. They really have knocked what they have so far out the park can't wait to see what they do in next year or two.
Is this Owen Wilson?
Try using more Anubis’s when making a mining farm, they will break it all and then put it in box’s
....damnit...gotta like and sub for the inventory information. Good job and thanks for including it.
Feel better about yourself because i had 0 idea about that. Im so pissed. Also how do you get the shirts?
Berries work just fiine, i have 6k berries in my feed box and i think i have only had a pal get sick 1 time, you just need an upgraded hot spring
I'm sure that's not how you say 'Digtoise'
If you dont want to spend a quintillion years crafting: craft every item once an then use cheat engine to multiply, its realy easy to do and in my opinion takes nothing away from the gameplay.
Thanks a lot of these are like oh duh. Made my game much better
Oh my god, that quick stack tip literally blew my mind. I feel like an idiot for moving everything one by one this entire time. Thanks for the video man
Don't forget when you slide down a hill  you gain super speed and then use the glider while sliding  you will go so far out . Maybe you didnt know that. Cheers!
Mind blownnnnnnn on the quick slot items
you can also use the extra pal box as a portable fast travel station
The grapple gun couple with the crafted critter glider is even faster! Stun baton works great to tame! When grenades are unlocked, the "Shock" grenades also increase taming!
Omg, i didnt even know quick stacking was a thing, my life has been changed
Thanks for finding the "transfer all" button
quick stacking!!!! tysm that is a big help how did i not see that
The stun baton doesnt work on xbox. Its just a weaker club
Ive "lost" all my coin a few times with the quick stack, some pals put random coins on random boxes and i didnt realize id quick stack everything all coins go into box without me realizing till i go to a merchat and have no coin lmao then its mini heart attack as i search through every box
You don’t need to use dogtoise special ability if you have his headband
Thanks for the tips man. I'm definitely using them today!!!!
Haha i was doing the palbox teleporter method the minute i got 2 pal boxes but now i set up seperate farming base and seperare mining base
Salads 🥗 are the best give great San an it gives them a work speed buff and it’s cheap to make
Here is something people havent said. YOU CAN CLIMB TREES. Its the small things. 😂
Dang I'm glad to see the inventory transfer tip lol
Can we get a build video of your ore base? I really like what I can see of the setup from this video
Quick stash!!! Wow.. never noticed this..
Once I get to lvl 27 I keep getting a World Save Error every 45 seconds. this keeps happening.
I like'd the video cus of the quick stack... i feel dumb 2 now hahaha
That quick stack tip…… oh my god you just saved me soooo much sanity! Don’t feel dumb at all, cuz I’m right there with you!
IMO the quick stack tip was godly 😂😂😭
Rushhog can mine alot quicker while riding if your riding and charge at the ore
The quick stack command is new to me thank you for this video.
lolol ooooor you know. you could just hit v on your doors and lock the stuff haha.
My clan and I decided berries were the best thing for our pals. No wonder they're always depressed and have ulcers 😂. Cooking up some berries now.
if I stack cold and hot Armour can I go to both places without getting cold or hot
Just play the game the way it was intended. That's not gatekeeping just not being a piece of garbage. Have whatever settings you want but don't use cheats and exploits
Great video thank you
Thank u for the tips! I didnt know about the black market merchant trick (tip no 1) ! I hope they will add option to expand ur inventory in the future
Seeing my Mozzarinas drinking their own milk was a traumatic experience for me 😂
found an issue with the stack glitch ( havent seen it talked about in the comments or im just blind).  one of my accessories has the full weight of all armors stacked, and you cannot remove it from your inventory, if you try to sort, your game crashes.  Just a heads up.
Build pickaxe and helmet at mining base. Makes them so efficient
Stun Baton is absolute garbage, doesn't even give more than 2% bonus to harder to catch Pals and takes a dozen hits to electrocute. It's not worth the equipment slot let alone the materials.
Man, if you had learned about the quick stack option sooner, you might be level 60 by now. Lol
8:06 of you tale stuff out of the cooler and back in it resets the timer. Works at food boxes as well
While i agree, play how you want. Bugs like this should be reported and not shared (unless to get more attention/priority from the devs). In solo play, you're only ruining the accomplishment for yourself, so i guess you do you. But in multi, it has clear abuse from advantages (no pvp yet ikik but people find any reason/ way to grief).
I couldn't figure out my problem with san thanks
Got a question about sharing pals with a friend.  If i put a pal in the palbox and station him at the base and my friend takes it out and adds to their party. Do they still get the credit for capture or do u have to use this drop mechanic?
I think it’s really funny that cotton candy, something that melts into colorful sludge within about an hour or two irl, is nonperishable in palworld
Quickstack... I'm so stupid
man none of these videos really help me bc i play on xbox and its a completely different game over there i feel like
The dude casually skips over the fact that he got 67k gold from capturing that black market dealer
Having a locked chest, but in a guild that is in the boundaries of the base circle, they can still use those items from the lock chest.
Yay!!! The R button
Lol quick stack, good to know. I was also moving things one over at a time with the Y button like a sucker 😂
Quick stack clutch
Question will you get hot or cold when u stack the armor ?  Thank you so much my coal and ore farm has been horrible I've be doing it manually with Anubis
I did not know about quick stack until now 😂😂
100% did not know about the fast transfer!! This is amazing and ty!
That Palbox near the boss move is such a big brain play
I've just been using the unlimited sphere glitch I've come across 😂😂😂
The boss fight method is SO HELPFUL 🔥
O juat pit a Pin code lock on my lwrsonal storage
I wouldnt call the grapple glider a glitch its more a trick and honestly doing something that could feasibly work in a world where momentum is conserved
im disappointed with digtoise doing such low damage on its own as well. overall not bad for passive farming while you do other things. i have no reason to mas produce anything and have an ever increasing amount of ingots that i cant seem to use fast enough.
15:44 i tested this glitch like 10 seconds after i watched it and... if you replace your glider with anything you will still be able to glide and it will be like 10 times further than with glider XD   ...oh and your character is doing a t-pose
Feel like that's a waste of a pal box as there's a teleport place right next to every boss 🤔 another tip when your animals stop eating because the game is glitched just put down more feed boxes  spread out in different spits and it will fix them not eating
@8:22 subliminal advertising for kohler
The triple shield life 🤣🤣
Move all at once! Holy you just helped me so much ! Subscribed with no doubt !!!
Tip for pals! Craft and feed your pals salad. Its cheap n easy to make and gives alot of san and nutrition.
Great video! 50 hours in and half of these were still new to me. Thank you!
That chest stacking is an underrated tip! Thank you! I hated moving it over.
Another tip for base building! Beds just need to exist within the parameters of your base in order to count towards your Pal’s SAN. Which means.. you can place the medium beds inside walls or between the ceiling and roof. In fact, it’s more efficient for your Pals to not be able to access their beds as they will just sleep wherever they are when it becomes night and instantly resume come morning. It saves you space and time!
11:02 - Digtoise is, currently, one of the worst in-base miners. This problem is not a general problem, it's specificially a digtoise problem. The devs may consider it bugged and fix it later, or they may not, but for the time being, Digtoise In Base = Bad. Even level 2 miners are better than him.
I love the game.  But you said youve been playing it non stop since it came out.. out of interest.. what do you do for a living? Do you make enough from making Youtube vids to live from? I work 9-5 all week in a hospital and would love to jack it all in and play games all day - but I've no idea how - so genuine curiosity here (not a critism of trying to be an ass lol)
I don't like the fact that you can buy pals.  I honestly feel like it takes away from the whole premise of the game, which is to go explore and catch pals.
Comment for algoritm : )
Is this Owen Wilson?
Oh my freaking god I didn't about the Quick Stack button! Omg thank you!
For the armor glitch I would only want that so I can equip heat and cold armor so I’m not swapping armor when I go to the tundra or desert
i dont think the grapple thing is a glitch i believe its inspired from just cuase games
Thank you for mentioning that people play in different ways that no one way is "better" than any other, and that it's about fun.  This is something that far too many gamers forget...my girlfriend has received death threats from people that continued on for weeks after she beat them in Fortnite, for example.  Goodness, people...whatever happened to fun?
That armor glitch will be the first thing they patch out.
3:40 Crafting ingridient will get accessed through the Chest Code... so if youre hiding crafting materials DO NOT do it in the Crafting base
The pal of next to the boss battle is a great tip! Genius
I found the armour stacking glitch on accident I was exploring the game and my witch hat was breaking so I took it off and put it on my armour and boom I was a floating head
owen wilson is that you
15:45 Wow that armour equip glitch is OP.
I had no idea either you could put them in the chest like that from your inventory.
the quick stack and armor shield stack glitches are goated
the quick stack is good but I wish I could lock some item in my inventory. Like arrows or balls.
Am i the only one who thinks he sounds like lightning mcqueen
Quick stack !!! Best tip ever
The quickstack tip insane...so much wasted time lmao
Digtoise is awsome for Individual nodes, but mamorest absolutely destoys large groups of nodes when you ride it.
Bruh that quick stack is amazing
The chest stacking shortcut.... Im an idiot. Thank you for sharing this, holy crap.
I didn’t see the sort button until two days ago so 😭😭😭
8:10 I cannot force my pals to put anything harvested berries / wheat in my mini fridge. The freezeer I have is not electric, which i think yours is. I need a cold pal to freeze it 24/7. I have only a few chests and they are all full of other mats, so my pals get confused and then just drop the food on the floor after they realise there is no open slots in any storage areas. Has anyone had success with that fridge/freezer (the one powered by a freezing pal)? Should unlock electric fridge in a few day i guess so hopefully it works on that one.
the best tip was the quick stack one, how did I not notice that option before?
To keep sanity high without cooking food, Get some Woolipops, condense them, and use the cotton candy for sanity. It has 1 satiety so it won't keep anyone fed, but each one gives 4 SAN.  In other news my goddamn farm is struggling even with a couple Broncheries for seeding, Azurlobes for watering and Robinquills for farming, a  Mozzarina and 2 Chikipis. STILL can't produce much more food than they eat. Even after I built Watering Fountain, Silo, etc. I'm just about to snap, demolish the whole base and move it somewhere else cause it's probably the pathing that messes everything up..
I wish I hadn't seen the armor stack glitch, and I hope it gets fixed sooner than later.
wish you could drop stuff without auto picking it back up, am i missing something
I knew it this game had a quick stack. Finally now I can speed up the process!! Thanks so much!
idk how ppl didnt know about quick stack when its clearly stated in the game😅
Dude, the first 3 "tips" were so exploity...
Wow I had no idea about that quick stack button
I learned 2 things, so I made sure to press the like button twice.
nah the base boss fight is actually funny and i never would have thought of it
In terms of the mounts (ground, flying, gliders) No one ever seems to talk about the pets who you use as a glider. I dont know if you get even better ones, but so far I have Galeclaw and he's wayyyy faster than the mega glider. This would work really well with your shield glitch and grappling gun technique!
Stacking armors and shields blew my mind.
Digtoise's ability is nuts from my experience. Mining takes so much less time, even compared to a full mining base setup. It speeds up progression drastically. On my second playthrough I b-lined to unlocking his ability.    The next unlock that was a complete game changer for me is the Vanwyrm mount (second flier you can unlock). I skipped the Nitewing sadle as it is really slow and compared to Vanwyrm not much earlier to get.
12:20 pal display box allows you to freely exchange many pals with your guildmates straight outta palbox, dont even need them in your party
11:00 I had the same problem, but after slotting 3-4 Anubis Pals into my mining base it became super efficent suddenly
About food - Mushroom stew is GREAT and easy/cheap to make.  Im using it on vanilla settings no problems, and to make it you just need berries and mushroom. This boost work speed of your pals and dont eat as often as just berries. You can find few mushroom spots on the red colour mountain (where penking is), just mark them on the map and you can do 1-2min runs on your mount, that clear all the spots and give you food for entire day or two.
The devs really need to make the Cooler the default place for food items... or, the feed box needs to move items already in it, to the left, when the first slot item is used up.  I can;t stand having good food in there, and then constantly having to come back and take out the uncooked red berries or wheat after my mushroom soup is used up, but theres jam filled bread in there too (that will never be eaten without manual moving it after the mushroom soup is gone) its really my biggest gripe.
I also played since launch and my brother found the "RB" transfer trick. It made me actually disgusted that its been available this whole time. I didnt know 😂😂
Ok quick stack tip is insane 24 hours in and I had no clue
Now these are good tips that are not just recycled tips found in every other video! Well done.  Subbed!
"SAN"  as sanity points, right.   Then Pal Mental Stability, but they didnt use its Acronym (PMS) 😂😂😂
You can also give ur pals cotton candy which is farmed from one of the pals so u can even just do that n still not cook. I rather keep eggs, flour etc for cakes to breed. They also need to get rid of timer on food its annoying if anything and sure u can put stuff in a cooler box with some pal freezing it or feed box if its farmed to reset the timers but if a pal glitches out then rip your 10 or hundreds of that food. They have these things so u don’t need to check but u still need to anyway cuz pals are buggy.
Wait... you can quick stack by pressing R on pc ?! It was such a chore to do it 1 by 1. Thanks a lot for the tip, this should be known to every player.
I never know the quick stack I even captured the Jetragon boss twice
Now the secret room is not longer a secret room :D
i had no clue about the quickstack lol your not alone
🤓☝
I'm sure they patch the armor stacking very soon
Well the secret room isn't so secret anymore. 😂
ABOUT STAKING ARMOR IMAGINE STACKING FULL ALL SLOT WITH WEAPONS
Dude sounds like owen wilson
san can get recoverd with a hot tub(forgot name)
Hmm pals spent all their time sucking you say? Is it possible to visit this base of yours? (Im asking for a friend).
Another end game tips i would pitch in. Is that rocket launcher, is the best mining tools in the game, not only it deals tons of damage (e.g: mine deals 4390 dmg to ore node) it deals in large AoE as well. So you probably only need about 4-10 rocket ammo in an ore cluster site to clear them ore out.
Great vid thanks ❤
Digtoise are glitched and you can breed Anubis early game highly recommend Anubis over digtoise
Right there with ya on the quick stack thing
In the best way possible doesnt this guy sound like kermit the frog?
i have dupes of my farming pals so when their san drops below 75, I rotate them into the workflow
50 hours in and I also missed the Quick Stack!!!!
They even have the subnautica prawn grapple technique 😂
or instead of using digtoise use your refined pickaxe its much faster
12 Advanced Tips You Didn't Know About PALWORLD.... yea sure buddy
who the f... are the peopel who does this kind of site with so much informations, the game is 10 days old.
Did not know about quick stack
not gonna lie a lot of this tips feel like "just wiki it/just use external apps" to me, there was some nice tips tho
The church is the best spot for natural ore mining to put a base. There are 12 huge mounds in the surrounding radius. You can convert the church into a factory
The tip for hiding your items from your teammates only works if you dont have materials there. Items work fine but any crafting material will be used if someone is crafting in the base regardless of the storage is locked with a password.
Downvoting alk Tutorial that use 100% capture rate or any easyer settings and then making videos on the Game  And if you need a pal box and 15 pals to defeat a boss thats just so sad
My pals only eat berries and I've never had them get sick or depressed
Tip# 13 When the fan girl raid happens put all pals in storage and t-pose and let them rush you…   10/10 would recommend
Call it 'gatekeeping' if you like, but looking down on and mocking people that exploit and glitch to cheat is ok.
9:45 why are you using that glider? The Pal Gliders go about 10-20 times further and faster then the made gliders.   The Arms one sends you flying super high and far, and the Galeclaw is crazy fast. Its actually faster then you even using the hook, and doubly fast if combined.  Edit: Not to mention that you can shoot from the Galeclaw
I do find it rather hilarious that you can use a pal box offensively, or just as a way to have a fast travel point anywhere. Take one with you to mine locations, mine an area, instant port back and put all the goodies away. No need to carry it around! :D   I wonder if they will do an update and changes this function a bit, because it does feel rather broken that one of the best use for the main base building, is to not use it for base building.
All great tips... until you started teaching ppl how to cheat. Bruh, what is wrong with you? This game already comes with a difficulty slider. How much of a numbnut are you that you gotta resort to cheating in an easy game like this? So fukking lame.
Advanced tip number 4 LOOK AT YOUR UI
Is there a way to place items in a chest at base but not have them be used by other players crafting?
lvl 40 and just found out the quick stack :/
Not going to lie I was saying yesterday why isn’t there a quick stack option like ark and now I know hahaah
The hyper shield tip is actually very useful for endgame boss fights. Thanks!
That quick stack tip saves so much time thank you😂
digtoise is just generally a bad base miner because he only does 1 damage any other pal is better and if you need t3 for coal you can use reptyro I think is the name
Omg I didn't know about quick stack holy fk I was wishing for this tysm
Awesome tips! If anyone playing solo feel free to join me
haha how could u not know about quick stacking?!?! i for sure knew.........i didnt know i have 60 hours in palworld LOL. great guides
wow the quick stacking help me a lot, thanks
The hiding your stuff doesnt really work tho, because if you have a building at a base, which if you dont want to deal with repair kits you probably will, meaning anything in the chest is put into a pool for anyone in the base to use, so only works for houses outside of base areas
The situation with the turtoises happens with me too, is better to have lvl 2 mining pals in the base, or finding others lvl 3 mining pals, but they are pretty high lvl in my experience.
If you pal's SAN is low you can force bath them, until their SAN is full
I didn't know that you could quickstack thank you for that tip
It’s really a lot more fun to discover things normally instead of using a map that just tells you where everything is. You should try it.
Autodislike
Quick stacking, oh shit thank god
This was realy helpful! I like that Map. Thank you very much!
gonna be completly honest i didn't know about ffast stacking xD
O dang now that's a busted glitch lol. Although I do like the premise of it to maybe have a more unique character set up. Playing as a team with unique character inventory would be nice.
If your pals have an issue with Sanity (SAN), build a hotspring or two they help MASSIVELY but what do I know I've only played for the last 20 hours
To capture black market trader anubis and a shotgun work a treat I always capture and then butcher them you make around 50k a time and 4 gold keys also at my mining base I don’t use digtoise they eat more and get stuck a lot . Instead use Anubis I’ve got 20 anubis running my ore base they mine quick especially combined they also carry and store and if you do need to craft there quick all around best setup I’ve had so far
Game looks boring and like a phone game lol
I’ve actually never seen my pal being depressed or sick, and I kept wondering why the hell the game gives me medicine that doesn’t heal me and takes a lot of space lol, is sickness a hard mode thing tho
Broooo the quick stack... Why didn't i see this sooner 🥲
I did not know about pressing the r button to quick stack. You can feel better lol.
With the San tip i just switch them out regularly and they seem to get beeter in the pal box the viewing cage heals instant to
Oh no I’m like you , who thinks of pressing r
I wonder if poison and stun baton stacks.
I always put a starter stack in the box I want my pals to deliver to. They tend to stick to that box unless full fars as I can tell.
How did i miss that restack button 😮
If you right click using mouse (unsure of controller) on food it lets you choose to either feed it to yourself or one of your pals in roatation (after you unlock feed bag doesn't matter) however if you use it on items in menu's chest or pal box it auto moves them so you don't have to do it slowly you only have to move from box to party manually however moving from party to box right click on mouse from box to base also a right click instant moves them without needing to manually drag them i'm sure theres other uses then aiming as well but thats all i've found so far
When a pal is weak or depressed I just swap them out with one without any ailments. They only get berries. 😂
Thank you for Quikstacking.......i had no idea XD
How are able to build and put things on top of the stone platform at 8:13?!  Every time I try to the game says you can’t place anything on a structure?
Here's a tip: Keep a backup of your heat and cold resistant clothing, in case you die in said region, and if you need to get back, as soon as you get in the environment start taking damage before you can get to your dropped gear.
holy f I hadn't seen the quick stack, thank you have a like
You can continue to use berries, make high quality beds and make sure your pals never get stuck on things preventing them from eating and you're good. I have 4 bases with 17 pals each atm and I only get the occasional ulcer or sick indication (every 10 days on one pal maybe even longer).
I didn’t realize this until endgame but if you have a slow pal in a boss fight you can just recall them before the bosses big attack hits and send them back out for no damage
I do the same thing with the feed box- but don't worry about getting a non perishable for the empty slots. Just have your stacks of wheat/berries/eggs/tomatoes in the final 2 or 3 slots of the bin then place your cooked berries and whatever else in the first two. I just use what he showed in the video for the most part- Jam toast and cooked berries. The eggs are great too- if you upgrade your Artisan Chickens with a condenser you'll be good. Same with the berry cows... if you upgrade them you wont need a berry farm.
not to sure with the pal san levels as i have the cheapest beds only raw berry's and there san never goes under 80
Ive been experimenting with the viewing cell for pals. since the game only gives you 480 pal slots in your 16 boxes, and I want to rank up a bunch to 4 stars just for fun, I'm gonna need a big storage complex to house hundreds of junk pets.   You can build the Cells halfway off your boundary line and it won't lose hp or despawn. This is because if the center of the object exist in your territory, you keep it. This means my 9 cells in the backyard are only taking up 4 1/2 as much space because the other half is resting out of bounds. Also you aren't even allowed to build out of bounds with these cells so there is zero risk of being off.  I also figured out that you can put them on the roof and build your base under them but never above. they have a ridiculously high hit box, Not sure where it ends but its more than 6 stories high so my dream of having a massive prison that goes vertically upwards for a mile is crushed.   Seeing as you can drop pals on the ground, they likely don't despawn, especially if dropped in base. You could create 137 individual rooms and just slowly move them from your pal box into your party, 5 at a time and "drop" them into their proper room.  I would work a system of organization based on pal number so i can find the correct pile for when I need it.   This is for the sweaty players that want to breed EVERY pal into perfect stats and get them 4 stars.  Hopefully the devs just let us build another palbox computer system that acts as external storage for junk pals we plan on turning into ranks later.
I love that levels dont scale as you do. So that you can run into those huge mega pals that you know will be a super challenge once you get to it. Reminds me of how botw did scaling, really well done imo.
Great vid 👍
Bro I’ve been playing this game for a week now & been watching YouTube vids on everything PalWorld.. but you Sir have shown me a few things I’ve never seen anyone talk about.. thanks! I’m off to try the armour & shield glitch 👍🏼
In regards to that secret room trick. Any chest in the base can have the resources pulled from it when building and crafting. Even ones you put a password on.
This could mention by another. But for guaranteed locked chest from guild mates. You must build the chest outside the barrier of the blue circle. Must be in building to avoid it taking damage over time. If not your usable materials to build can still be access without them opening it. Eggs, armor, ammo etc will stay secure
I see the quickstack function after 40 hours...
Didn’t know about the quick stack option 😂 thank you
Thanks for the quick stack tip. I was looking fot this feature but couldn‘t find it 🙈
I know them all. Try again 😎
Yo for the grapple hook thing. It's better if you aim really high above you and grab something and sling upward. And it doesn't matter when you as long as it's before you hit whatever you grappled
Quick Stack?? OMG!!!
Finally! Some actual helpful tips. Thanks 👍
Holy.  I am so far into the game and I didn't realize there was quick stack either. Thanks brother.
If someone needs an early game base where the NPCs and wild pal's can't attack - just build a base at the beach area near the starting area (south of the Plateau of Beginnings) . I built my first base there and every time there is an attack the enemies get stuck to the castle ruins and can't never reach your base. 😅 But the enemy AI may get improvements in the future updates. But the area sucks because there is not much resources for your pals to collect. But at least no no need to worry that some raiders will destroy your base.
Yes, I agree the inv to chest was super useful... (Just started almost wanted to give up lol... Encumbered lul character doesn't even move...)
Big props for the last tip. You got a new sub for that one my dude!
5:06 I actually tried to at least cook all the berries I had, but I feel like this is something that needs to be added to the game. A way to automate cooking food specifically for the Pal box (as well as just better auto sorting in general). I have a stack of pancakes in the feeder, just in case the need arises (since they they say they lower SAN loss), but I really want a way to automate cooking them. Something else that helps is a Wollipop ranch, since cotten candy doesn't spoil, and gives a bit of SAN (but it's so slow to produce, with basically no nutrition).
Did you also know you can crouch slide down hills then glide to get faster glider momentum as well.
20 hours until you tell me the r key
I mean are u actually hiding stuff cuz the inventory of the chest  is shared in the base o.o
This game will have pvp devs said
😂 the quick stack got me also. I'll join the idiot club.
Mammoth boss pal has an AoE stomp that clears multiple ore deposits in 2-3 casts. You need to ride it tho. It might or might not damage your base, so it's better used in ore farming bases i.e. near the church or on autumn planes base spot. Another downside - trees get cut too, but tbh any type of inconvenience for DAMN AOE
9:56 BOTW glitches making their way into Palworld now? Now that's hilarious.
We use the "pals at base " section for gifting/trading pals
wow thank you i never know about quick stack!!!! thank you ^_^
🤩👍👍👍
dude that last trick im playing the Renamon mod and with that trick i  can swap the armor and accessory slot and not have the armor show up on the char which clipped with the mod. you could use this with a nude mod as well and run around with no cloths but get the benefit if you wanted. mega helpful.
I knew that you could quick stack things from your chest into your inventory. But I didn't know you could do it the other way around. I don't know how many times I accidentally took everything out of my inventory
Hitting pals from behind with the sphere will have a higher capture chance than in front.
WTF 90 Hours of gameplay and had to be told about quick stacking...🤦‍♂️
your pals gets fucked up because the AI breaks when theres no one around them (that includes you going explore away from the base). They end up just standing in one spot and do absolutely nothing, get depressed, starve to death and even injure themselves badly. When you go offline a server, just put back all your pals into the palbox so that doesnt happen, they do absolutely nothing when aint there anyway.  Ive been feeding berries to my pal since day 1 and they are just fine, its not the food its the pals being stupid when you are not around.
Just make jam filled toast once you unlock wheat farm. Then the salad once you unlock lettuce and tomato plantation
This shit is crazy lmao
That cotton candy tip earned you a follow!!
IMO just use a galeclaw with gloves is very underrated.  Can only imagine stacking that with the glide trick.
Just use hot tubs and fluffy beds for SAN.  Then raw berry away.
Torch can help to it lights pals on fire. lol
Make sure you keep palsouls on you aswell. They weigh nothing. When a guildmate upgrades pets and u have palsouls in yer password box, they still get used
Digtoise is good at mining at the stone pit. When it comes to mining resource nodes though the pal’s attack damage is actually the biggest factor, not their mining level. Mining level does matter depending on what node you want to mine I believe it goes:  Lvl 1: Stone Lvl 2: Metal Lvl 3: Coal, Sulfur, Quartz  Each level builds on the rest of course, ie. lvl 3 can farm metal and stone in addition to the rest. That said the best pals for farming nodes will be whichever ones you have with the highest attack value that can mine the node you want.
Luckily for me i noticed early on the quick stack was a thing. Still had to suffer through the slow sorting at first though thx for the tips.
Is anyone having issues on the map screen where there controller will just go sharp left or right or really any direction and it makes it impossible to use the map consistently? And if so do you know how to fix it
Trust me mate you're not on your own if you didn't show me about quick stacking in this video I would have probably never found out about
Something I haven't seen anywhere and doesn't seem to be on the ui anywhere is that you can hit r to repair all your stuff at the same time.
You got my like for the quick stack tip ! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
loved the video ..thanks a lot .. much help.
In terms of mining ore, i find Rushour's Reckless Charge mine waay faster as per charge, I can do 1.7k to 1.8k damage to the ore. To maximise efficiency, when slightly above halfway fully charging for the skill, I unmount so that the moment the skill deals damage, I get off Rushour and end the animation. Sometimes, certain places or other type of ore doesn't stop the animation despite unmounting, so I'll just store my pal back and resummon to use Reckless Charge again.
Good stuff. Thanks. Been wondering how Pals eat...
for the glider, literally just slide down the slope and deploy the glider. Works best with Hangyu.
Digtoise is currently bugged.  So I've been using Tombats in the mean time until Ican get some Anubis.
Tombat > Digtoise for ore
I have 70+ hrs and didnt know about the 'R' sort button thank you!
plug on the quick stack tip
Get an alpha digtoise usually hits more then one rock at a time pretty clutch
bro that quick stacking tip is such a life saver lmao
No way! No way I can just press R and it moves them all specifically the ones that are already in the box. Oh my god that’s such a good solution too! Not many games think that far in.
Digtoise is not good for your mining, Anubis and Astegon are way better than Digtoise when it comes to mining.
Not secret anymore 😢
Bro making 10 pals fight a boss is cheaty 😂😂
I don't even carry pickaxe anymore, digtoise is just the best grinder there is. No need to unlock the skills and I play on vanilla settings, just throw him next to an ore and he will blender that thing to bits in seconds... Unless your digtoise went on it then that's gonna be a janky floaty grinding session 🤣🤣🤣 beyblade powaaaaaaaa!!!
I have 44 hrs of palworld and I didn't notice quick stack either...
The food storage rotation  and cooking tip is the best one
If you are in a chest, feed box, cooler. There is a sort function. On xbox itnis clicking the right thunbstick. When clicking this with the cursor is in your inventory, it resets the food timers of your inventory. Then move cursor to storage box then click it the food timers in the storage box will reset. It also works moving food in and out of inventory
I just smashed the RB button about a dozen times. Works sooo much better. Thanks for that.
I have 119 hours in the game and i did not realize that you can press R to quick stack items. The amount of time i’ve lost….
I think digtoise is bugged, but level 2 mining pals can mine iron, I use the big mudkip and he's great
The only tips o learned from this vid is also embarrassingly the quick stack options lol
Great tips here, there was like only one or two I already knew (aside from the quick stack). While using the base as a mobile Carrier is both hilarious and ingenious, it’s hard for me not to immediately put my bases down as soon as I earn them (I pre-plan the spots as im exploring), I just feel like im losing out on so many resources
the campfire can do a passive cooking, you can make like 10 of it, and just leave the berries and mushrooms on them as you leave and explore
I don't agree 100% with the food tip, I never have an issue, and all I do is add some extra hot springs. I've only ever had a single Pal have an issue, and it was in a base that didn't have much to keep them sane. Berries are the only food I generally have in the Food Box, though I do toss random food drops from pals in, on occasion. If you want to take the time to cook food, go for it, but so far I haven't seen it as a significant issue. Fluffy beds and hot springs are more than enough, generally.
YES! I have been playing for a week and level 42 and I just learned on console that you don’t have to take Y on the item to move it to storage but RB And it stacks all like items, so fast now!! Game changer tip imo! Good video and content!
one of the viewers that doesn't know about Quick Stack, sunk in 100 hours too, you can buy medicines though instead of crafting and they are not too pricey late game considered that money come in abundance
My Pal's SAN is always nearly maxed out at my bases, I think it is cause I never care to overwork them and I have hot baths for them to always relax in with comfortable beds.
I wasn’t aware of the quick stack either 💀
that quickstack tip.....  bruh....
Lol. Yet another YouTuber that has to cheat to succeed. Oh, I know, it's not cheating, it's an "Exploit", that's every cheaters favorite line. It's not cheating if it's in the game. Pathetic.
I just use cotton candy so my woolipops just feed all my pals so I don't need to think about feeding any of them. And it's working perfect 👍
oh my god. quick stack is the greatest thing ever and i'm so glad you taught me it.
That gattling caught me by surprise lol
Even bigger tip for mining, hop on a rushoars back. Three charging slams will break an ore, and if you hit that one spot near the Chillet, you can break 7 ores in 2 minutes every other day.
Gatekeeping is so dumb :)
5:00 I didn't know - thank you so much.
this video went on for 20 minutes what was an at best 10 minute video..... please learn or implement content that actually gets to the point
Love you man but, “mental stability”? SAN points are sanity points it’s the pals Sanity level
hey can i know where you found the grapple glide glitch? coz i haven't seen any other videos other than my own about it and was wondering if someone else knew about it before me
Moving stuff over 1 item at a time was a pain... thanks for the tip, was looking for something saying it was in the game.
Where did you find this stuff I wonder🤔
You can do the glider trick with sliding down hills using Hangyu lets you glide at an incline as well, so it's my go-to early speedy flying mount
Thank you for the quick stack, that I never saw 😂😂🤯🤯🤯
Overwolf has a program called Palworld Interactive Map, and well, the name says for itself, but it is completely FREE, unlike mapgenie which has a cap of 100 for marking found stuff.
You can also jump on a sphere as you catch a pal and when it hits 100% you’ll spring up in the air just make sure you have a glider. I use it to see in the distance when I do it.
9:45 so it's a Just Cause 3
"advanced tips" -> proceeds to show the quick stack feature which literally is labelled and tells you what button to press. Lmao
one thing I wonder do all these creator only have youtube because I started palworl the 2nd day it was out and I'm not even near the end of the game
Is this a big ducks alt channel? You sound almost exacly like him.
I HAVE BEEN SAYING THERE SHOULD BE A QUICKSTACK FEATURE SINCE I STARTED PLAYING. Why am i dumb:( thank you for that tip lol
Why did you show everyone the climbing through stairs trick? Now my guild members will see this and find all the stuff I stole from them:(
I’m not used to playing survival games. Been mostly a shooter but this game has been hella fun! Your tip with the stacking was literally the best tip imagined. I didn’t know it until you said something. Appreciate it for real!
Has anyone had issues getting on flyers? I'm level 34 and it says my stats are abnormal and won't let me fly. I haven't flown once yet someone hep
CTRL, or Dodge button is what cancel the grappling hook
i dont ever have problems with pals getting sick or upset as long as you give them better beds and a hot spring berries work just fine :D
Thumbs up regardless of any new knowledge. All the hardworking is deserving of it
Didn’t know about quick stacking.
That last tip is insane I think ill use it to stack the elemental protections and that’s it
You can also get fast glider by sprinting down a hill, jumping then holding B so you go into a slide, then jumping again and going into a glider. This seems a little easier to pck up than the grapple shot, and has the added bonus of not requiring you to make and carry the grapple if you dont want to.
For faster gliding you should have galeclaw in your team and galeclaw gloves, makes you glide super fast 9:45
I didn't see the quick stack either this is amazing ty ty lmao
Secret room is only good for non crafting mats...otherwise they can just pull the mats from ur box while crafting even if u lock it too
Early exploration tip I'm surprised nobody covers that goes along with your second tip.  There are a number of respawn points close to fast travel points. Take a moment at the start of the game to respawn in each area to unlock easy fast travel.   When you unlock the second base explore at your leisure and drop the second base any time you want to teleport back home.  Secondary addition is that poison and freeze also make pals easier to catch along with electricity.  Not sure about fire...
Hats off to you for that last tip. Some ppl just wanna have fun and not be too hardcore about it lol
I also didn't know about quick stacking and I've been playing since launch as well. Thanks for that!
Thank you i knew their had to be some kind of quick stack but i swear i hit every button ill try this later
nice vid you earned my sub
Been having a good time but I’m at a point where I need to start getting better gear/maximizing my resource collection. These vids def help a lot. And  I always thought the SAN stood for sanity lol
I never understood gate-keeping for survival games especially when I don't think this game has pvp (could be wrong). It's always fun to find some way to make the game easier that the Devs didn't think of.
Very Helpful Video thank you :)
