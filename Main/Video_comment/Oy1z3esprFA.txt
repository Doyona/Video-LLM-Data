Lies  lies
Time 4 reaping ❤🎉
Let the people pick a winner. We chose Justin Baldoni not you bullies.
Hugh and Ryan go together like Coffee and Gin. 😂
0:21-0:30, That part has to be scripted. There is no way the bridge between has sunk to depts of the sea.
Whose here in 2024 😅😂
Hugh jackman the most beautiful man ever.❤❤
forgiveness IS more than saying sorry!
Nah nah nah Hugh you have to do something nice to Ryan because you said mean things to him
You want forgiveness  Get religion!
Well this aged well
*They are so good at pretending they despised each other I did try to find out how the "feud" started.*
0:11 Catchphrase free guy
hahaha , why havent I seen these until now. Lol love yah guys mmmwha
Now they’re best friends
Watching this after Deadpool & Wolverine❤️💛
This was the best marketing ever, hyping this cameo for a long time for their movie
Two words.    *HONDA  ODYSSEY*
I'm gonna have to go with the kids
I love how they just have a bunch of advertisements that are disguised as a war that seems like something between kindergartners just more playful. Best advertisement method ever
I will definitely forgive Ryan Reynolds’s, for sure I am on his side a 100 percent
Capitalism make sick childreen
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry (I'm sorry)
Forgiven.  All I'm going to say is for the White Culture to look out for yourself. As an Asian, I do notice that the White Culture is being bullied by the Black Culture way..... too much. There's a tendency for the Black Culture to victimize themselves and using the Race Card to take advantage over the White Culture. What I noticed in the advertisement realm is this: Black people only, And Black People & White People. And more black culture advertisement shoving down on other viewers throat everytime I watch TV. I'm sorry to say this, but the world 🌎 doesn't revolve around Black People, the world 🌎 revolves around for ALL ETHNICITIES. ........If we truly want to be fair ⚖️ and allocentric, why not make the advertisement realm consist of: Whites, Asians, Hispanics, Blacks, Middle-Easterns, and Native Americans?  That's the true definition of being ALLOCENTRIC.
😂😂 Love those two.
"....the canned cranberry sauce of humanity." The worst insult ever.
Great movies coming out this year, BUT HEY GUYS I'm only waiting for DeadPool 3, the rest are fillers
Forgive only after punishment
Sounds like Deadpool 3 will be about Wolverine vs Deadpool
0:11 "Nicholas Cage, is that you?"
Rey rye nold i think huge packman can help u with your Daily menstruation problems yeppp
Got the plot for deadpool 3, thanks ryan 😉
oh that’s so sweet 🥹
i wish there was reiavlry like this in bollywood it like ryan and hugh ,,,kevin hart and dwayne johnson  and tom holland and anthony mackie   john cena and dwayne johnson ...like i would love that kinda friendship
Wake up sheeple. Obvious feud made for profit margins. Anyone who thinks this is real needs to stop watching everything because you're a moron. Seriously, have some dignity in humanity and stop looking up to these actors using you to just make money for themselves and others. Shame on both actors for thinking this is funny when they should be trying to best represent their peers and customers. Don't cancel them, first ammendment, just shame them, first ammendment.
so they were working on Deadpool 3  way before the announcement
Wow
LOVE THEM
Wow
How Wolverine and Deadpool would be in real life.🤣🤣🤣
Tell it to the military not on my watch are criminals taking over the united states'
Me Realising It Was Planed You Told Us A Year Ago But Indirectly #Deadpool3
They gave Ryan a better candidation on purpose to help make him win for him to feel better about himself. Kudos and props. Big ups, yo.
Holidays can be emotional brawls with family members.
Seeing this now....
I'm your little fan- robert
Deadpool 3 !!!!
Dam lost all that Canadian politeness, Australian real toned down in rough housing …..no maple syrup koala bears huh
01:10
Thank you
All I can imagine are Wolverine and Deadpool.
You evils🤩🤩🥲
You both need Jesus!
The canned cranberry sauce of human beings.
woo woo =D
You want forgiveness? Get religion.
I pic Ryan
Whisky + Coffee = Irish Coffee Aviation Gin + Laughing Man Coffee = Marvel Crossover Coffee?
Walmart (Sam's Club) is evil.
Best nemesis ever
DeadPool & Wolverine, great characters of Marvel, thx 4 all.
"The canned cranberry sauce of human beings"...LMAO
They speak of hate, but all I feel is love. 🥰 Happy Holidays!
Photographs of yourself blue tacked on plates
Two brilliant, and kindhearted men!
Who won?!
Ryan i love you  I hope you see this comment Im your biggest fan .Anyway, I love you very much. You are my only favorite actor.i love you love you 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍I wish I could see you, but I do not think it will happen because I live in Iran and I do not know when we are going to emigrate, but if one day we emigrate, one of my biggest wishes is to be surprised by you and be able to see you.♥️♥️♥️Please please please if you see this comment reply to me   You do not know how happy I am to respond to my message
I’m sorry Hugh but I choose Ryan
GO LOOK AT MARINA ABRAMOVIC EVENT BODY IN A TUB AND JACKMANS LINK TO CLINTON FOUNDATION
1 min ad with Hugh and Ryan.   FORGET SKIP, REWIND GOES BRRRRR
Meu actor preferido como é possível morrer eu amava tanto Fica paz.todos vamos triste todos dias cantor actor sinto muito ..🙏🙏😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wonder if Hugh Jackman realizes that Ryan Reynolds is a fictional character played by Wade Wilson. Great cosplay by the way.
Forgiveness is for the weak   Go Walmart !🐢 P.S. Ry , the hair , , fabulous !
Forgiveness  is more than saying sorry to forgive is devine so let’s have a glass of wine and have make up sex until the and of time time time time  TiMeeeeeebfhjwifnsj time.
Super
Both
The Samsclub I work at had life size posters of both of these gentlemen. I have the life size poster of Ryan Reynolds in my closet now and I have never been more proud in my life.
Nah, Ryan. You make everything awkward
Wow it's been a year agooo
Hugh: Ryan is THE cranberry source of human beings... Me: ...I like cranberries.
I still want a Wolverine/Deadpool Movie
Wade : Forgive me for turning against you Logan : Forgive me for chopping your goddamn head
Oh you two gorgeous sexy men…. this Cougar is going to let you know that I like cranberry AND mistletoe for the Holidays… No need to fight LOL!😉❤️
I'm ready to see them hug.
Are you guys doing this again for 2021? Cause that would be awesome 👌 👏
Is hard because revenge feels so much better.
You can side with me who’s a cameo here sometimes, or the guy you’re subscribed to
Wait... is there some sort of rivalry here?
WHY TF ARE YOU MAKING ME CHOOSE? I LOVE BOTH EQUALLY!!!!!!!!!!
We really wanted a Wolverine vs Deadpool Sequence.... Guess that's happening in another Multiverse.
Wow, i would never imagine that Wolverine and Deadpool could be really great friends lol
Liking those leather arm chairs.
The Sick Kids Foundation? That's fucking horrible. Why can't it be The Healthy Kids Foundation?
Hahagaha funny I have a saying ut aint Christmas till someone cries hahahaga you two are truly funny guys
Man, Hugh Reynolds and Ryan Jackman are so funny
Don't make me choose between you two.
I would love to watch a movie with these two playing themselves
But... I love canned cranberry sauce. I dont think I've actually ever had cranberry sauce that wasn't canned. This is too confusing, seriously... im feeling like my Thanksgiving and Christmas's... not so much Easter, because the Easter bunny is a twat(c word, im not allowed to say the c word).. but those holidays, based on cranberry sauce, are all lies!
Wow, Wolverine and Deadpool in real life.
Who do I side with to help abused animals? I mean somebody has to go to BJs, right?
I root for ryan!!!
Is Hugh Jackman even Aussie anymore? Wtf is cranberry sauce?
But mutants have to stick together. 🥺
These guys are great :D
WHy am I know seeing this???
Ohhh I just I just cannot lose😄😅😅😆😇  This message is Lion of Judah approved
....it's more than saying sorry
are there any outakes out there of ryan and hugh?😂
*"Want forgiveness, get relegion"*
jesus, i am laughing my ass off to every ad ryan does. Great work omfg!
"You want forgiveness? Get religion." - Spider-man
Pretty...🤪
Being the "canned cranberry sauce of [a] human being" is the opposite of one engaging in maximum effort.
ryan is the only person worthy to do ads
Hugh won in case anyone was wondering.  And since Canada has 1.5 times the population of Australia, that means potential national bias was overcome by quite a lot and that the world decided definitively, overwhelmingly, in favor of Mr Jackman.  Fair in humanity restored.  Or possibly they voted in favor of Coffee over Children. Which is possibly more likely. Faith in humanity remains about the same
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry
I love canned Cranberry sauce. So jokes on you.
coffee farming community are the same as the cartel families that make that other white powder. Huge fail there.
I wuv both
I choose ryan
TEAM RYAN
If I have to choose, I choose Bulbasaur.
Canada forever!
They say hate and love are sides on the same coin
who is sam?
If ads would typically be like this, I’d never skip them🤣
ryan is beter
Damn
I love the whole thing with these two. I just wish we could've got Deadpool a bit earlier so we could've had something with both him and Wolverine together
Why are they at war in the first place???
I bet they chocked on each other's tongue after the cut the cameras!
please make a movie together...like deadpool 3
Hugh won that round at the end of the day 😂😂😂
Both are my favourites
Merry Christmas people ✌🏻❤️🌍
MT1015406. Here's the short of it.  Regardless of your return policy, please process my refund for $136.50 due to your coverage and service not being what it promised to be.  I kept my part of the agreement and paid for the service which I never received.  I contacted your office about this issue, well within the 7 days, and explained what was happening and my concerns with the up-coming holiday weekend.  I had my service transferred back to my previous carrier as soon as was possible.  This is getting to a point where I will not be recommending your service to anyone.
Who would win deadpool or wolverine
Bully Maguire : you want forgiveness get the religion
Hugh Jackman "Ryan is the canned cranberry sauce of human beings" 😆 🤣
Is this a sequel to Truce?
This is what happens when Deadpool and Wolverine decides to be BEST FRIENDS FOREVER ...
Best Frienemies advertising ever! :-D
Forgiveness,  Is more than saying sorry. To forgive is divine,  So lets have a glass of wine,  And have make up sex, Until the end of time time time time time *Time*
They should make a Deadpool vs Wolverine movie
"Get religious"
I like how Ryan put this kind of thing into Deadpool and Wolverine relationships in Deadpool movies.
you guys  i wanna see wolverine and deadpool talking like you guys
Ryan def wins
I know I am a bit late to this party... but~ Deadpool 3 with Wolfy/Hughy or riot!    Oh and don't forget NSYNC! Or we gonna haunt you. Yours truly fans~ :D
Me: never even watched a ryan reynolds video/movie in my life Youtube: I know just what to recommend
Did we...did we just intentionally watch an ad for SAM'S CLUB??
The title of this video made me think this was going to be about the Just Friends movie
I…I like canned cranberry sauce… 🤷🏻‍♂️
I with Ryan
So much love Hugh
Forgiveness is not given to those who committed treason, or those who spoke on behalf of the democrats
Love yall both lol
I mean just look at this.❤  https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/f4e15f44471627.58136426db535.jpg  After watching the video.
It's all fun and games until the coffee farmers start hiring hitmen to off the sick kids to get more donations...
We need a real steel 2
i don't know who to choose, THIS IS SO UNFAIR
I love both you guys I love the good things that you guys achieve with your supposed rivalry I love the volunteer work that you're both known for doing with adults and children the good natured back and forth the two of you have and the incredible good you do with it I just wish you guys all the luck and power going forward carry on gentleman you're awesome.
The furry furtive acoustic functionally scream because taiwan lily launch towards a dynamic violin. juicy, abounding stage
They should have wore the Deadpool and Wolverine costume for the video. At least in the end.
Wolverine Disguised As Hugh Jackman: *Forgiveness*  You'll be *Forgiven* when You're in *Deadpool III*
So who won anyways?
lol
Sorry Ryan....
Me with only enough money to donate to 1 foundation:- *Make up u peeps!*
Ryan is the only person that can make me want to watch an ad
Reynolds has so much feminine energy, maybe growing up in Canada that made him like that
0:20 😂
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry. To forgive is divine, so let's have a glass of wine, and have make-up sex until the end of time, time, time, time, tiiiiiiiime... time.
How can you forgiveness if you didn’t do anything wrong and you got blamed also got hurts from the people said who loves God .... How can you forgiveness if you never get respected and betrayed for a big lie ?
Please make a movie with these two and Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.   PLEASE!!!
"Forgiveness is more than sayin' sorry".
Hugh Jackman : Casually mentions Ryan reynolds    Ryan reynolds: Whomst has summoned the almighty one?
I thought for a minute there Hugh was going to say, "Do you ever shut up, pal?"
Life is about experiences, and if it weren't for mistletoe and some vodka and cranberry juice I would never have had my only experience kissing another man. Hey,, I didn't say they were all good, but it actually led to a woman getting involved and we all shared a wonderful evening together. From what I remember of it.
The torpid euphonium antenatally man because treatment intuitively itch to a efficient lipstick. amusing, worried lip
Would I be able to support both, I like both Laughing Man coffee and Aviation Gin
aww this is beautiful, so much love for eachother, you two should really consider starting a family together
With enemies like this, you don’t need friends!
this seems cute until you actually think about what's happening.
Ryan is so damn funny
Show us Wolverine & Deadpool in a movie, with hints of fued, teamwork, comedy, etc...
Jajaja
omg i hate this
Huh...I can only find the gin in my area. Guess I know who won.
wow deadpool and wolverine ♥️
To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.
1k dislikes are from people who actually like canned cranberry sauce.
Canada vs Australia
I would love to see wolverine and deadpool the movie
MORTAL KOMBAT: WOLVERINE AND DEADPOOL, FIGHT !!!!!
Picture perfect
The name Hugh can be confusing sometimes, because you can never tell whether someone says 'you' or 'Hugh'
If only Hugh kept his chin-balls, he would have won years ago.
Rip Ryan Reynolds        PP
Friendship and open heart are the way to fight lonelyness and worried. Oke i wanna see you two dancing together
perfect frienemies
Who to choose... If we're going to be honest, coffee is our future.
These Two Are Like The Stallone And Schwarzenegger Of The 21st Century
Man. I really wish I had known about this so I could viciously watch lost-liter(aka free) movies from both of you while donating large-to-me sums for health-span research instead.  Ha!
2 anti hero guys who save the world from stan lee
We need a frenemy buddy cop movie with these two. As the best detectives in the department that hate each other but are partnered up.
The SickKids foundation. Making Kids Sick all around the world <3
one more reminder that we'll never see a wolverine & deadpool movie.
Hugh: we're gonna help coffee farmers  Ryan: we're helping sick kids  Me: Shut up and take my money!!
I wish I had seen this at Christmas; I would have been Switzerland, and sided with both of you, so I could have contributed to both of your worthy causes. Sigh...
"Two people in room can get a lot more done that a hundred."                                     - T'Challa?
can you guys just do a fucking wolverine/ deadpool movie already....worlds taking a shit kicking and i think it needs it....just saying
I love this epic battle but I've gotta go with Ryan not cause he's Canadian (i'm Canadian) but because of sick kids (I was a sick kid) who sort of matured into a sick adult. #TrueStory
I love how Hugh won lmao
I think Ryan owes us all an apology for Green Lantern.
Wolverine yeeer
Oh FFS, get a room you two and get it over and done with 😂😂😂. I vote Hugh BTW
One of the best bromances since Kakashi/Guy and Naruto/Sasuke
Jimmy & Hugh vs Ryan & Matt One episode
It's so appropriate seeing Wolverine and Deadpool going back and forth at each other. LOL
Lets just say brawling brings people together and your both right so your both welcome 😉😂
They are literally Wolverine and Deadpool EVEN in their personal relationship lmao
Bjezez... Theres a reason i bought everyone yogurt for xmas... Way to prove me right
They have a strong bond of friendship not like others
gee learning from politicians lol.
That’s cooool
Also hated ones😂aint that the damn truth
I had no clue you were canadian
Hugh a monster... 🤔. Well... Hugh was on Epstein Island... Was Ryan?
And to think this all started because Deadpool and Wolverine are so closely intertwined in the comics.
Please make a comedy movie together or any movie it's perfect pair
I love those leather chairs!
They say If your gay I would disown you a lot in my family. I'm not gay, but god I do not wish to be own, and could use a holiday like that, But how to I fake the gay?
After he herd I graduated, My Father went and got his GED. I'm going to say cause of Grandma, or his mother.No excuses if your own son can do it.
My Father, I forgive you. You are a Smart man. You needed only to pass one test to prove it, and it was not a GED. It was a Parturnity Test. Never let them say your Stupid.
The chemistry between these two is so awesome and it’s tragic that they both starred in one of the biggest film franchises ever and only got to be together once.
Frenemies is what they are
Will you two just sleep together already ?
This is the exact relationship Deadpool and wolverine hav... wait
Who won????
Holidays are about emotional brawl. Sweet joy to see these two together. Go Sam’s Club 😉
Begs the question. Why couldn't two multi-millionaires get in a room together for charity??? P.S. Ryan, loved you in Sabrina. xxx
* TOGETHER FOR  ANOTHER ..... 💗 !!!!! * A PARTNERSHIP AND STRENGTH TOWARDS WELLBEING  . LETS HELP A SICK CHILD FEEL MUCH BETTER KNOWING THAT WE CAN ALL SATISFYINGLY SMILE ,  TOWARDS GETTING BETER WE'LL SOON.*
I forgive You Ryan Reynolds Not you Hugh Jackman because I don't like when you mean a lot
They need to make a movie together,with Ryan as the director!!
JUST BE WOLVERINE AND MAKE THE FUCKING MOVIE ALREADY
So basically we are watching Wolverine and  Deadpool in a you tube channel and with out
“Also uhh hated ones!” 😂😂
❤
Hugh in his mind: "Will someone finally find a way to shut him up"
All i see is Wolverine vs Deadpool

x men beef cakes
If these two ever stop arguing, it's probably the end of the world. Brace for the Apocalypse!
You guys made me cry.  In a good way.  Shop Sam's - do some good.
😀😀😀😀
If they actually hated each other they wouldn't be in the same room with each other.  These two are the best of friends.
I pick Hugh Jackman sorry I just LOVE HIM SOOOOOOO much, but you are good too
Wolvering: does he ever shut up Deadpool: f*CK
I love canned cranberries. One of my boys is named after you Ryan.
Legendary
I love how the commercial cuts off hugh Jackman when he says the fue-........
They are the Sir Patrick & Sir Ian of this generation.
omg i am so glad i found this  subscribed
Ryan I'll side with you since you seem like your willing to go balls deep on poleverine
My guys hurry up and make a movie together already, we’re all waiting for the heals love and backstabs. As it is for all BFFs where u want to dunk them in Toffee then lick them down to there tightly Whiteys. Coming this 2021 Huge & Ryan come together to kiss an make up in a new movie.😜
What was Hugh doing at that spirit cooking with Lady Gaga and the rest??
Who's the Canadian with the funny (stupid) accent?
When can we see a movie with these two playing together? I wanna live THAT long.
Love Laughing man !! Best coffee out there right now I think :) If I drank I am sure Aviation Gin would be the best too!! Happy New Year to the both of you! :)
Oh a sly way of making a commercial Boys.    If you want to help the ill or impoverished.  Do it personally and do it without expecting a thankyou .
If you play the video at half speed, they both look and sound like they are drunk, lol
Can't believe I just voluntarily clicked on and watched an entire ad without skipping.
Okay Youtube, I get it. You are seeking forgiveness for all those impetuous Political Ads you forced me to watch. This one was funny and while way off topic, it made me laugh like a little kid. Thanks for this weird algorithm of suggested videos now. I still don't forgive you yet, but you're on a roll!
forgiveness is more than saying sorry.
Rycrowe vs. Ryman  make it happen
love them booth
Friendship is Not start here becouse both actor has knifes in hend lol
This is the closest live action crossover well get between wolverine and Deadpool
"Can of Cranberry Of Humans" 😂😭😭😭
haha
Ryan's vidios SUCK
I watch this and it makes me smile
I like canned cranberry sauce
I am just waiting my million times salive enzime sperm processed cologne
Holidays, all about forgiveness, as in for giving away free stuff to people!
both of them have a sense of a ''homicidal'' humor which is pretty unique because you dont know if they are gonna make fun of each other , or lunge at each other with built-in claws or Sharp saumrai swords !
Im one of the ppl - you both trash.
Pick a side? But they're both awesome 😍
https://youtu.be/7npI-HaZmsU happy new year not from Ryan Reynolds 👍🏻🙏
I love this feud.  Sick kids in Toronto benefits. It’s one of the best children’s hospitals in the world.
IS THERE ANY CHANCE that there is a way to get a copy of the prop music box from "DP2?"  "I'mm all out of love..."
The winner was announced! https://youtu.be/ctOf_oUeRyw
I built the dog pound gym that hugh work out at and have met him once or twice and he was very civil.  BTW Hugh, I was taking video of the gym for my portfolio And you got in my way but, I'll forgive you. Never met Ryan but I'm sure he's a massive dick....Just look at that arrogant smirk! ...Love you both keep up the good work!
Canned cranberry sauce is my favorite thing about the holidays!  Which probably says more about me, than it does my support of Ryan or Hugh or Sam Walton and his club. :-/
I thought Ryan is talking to Satan but instead it's Hugh Jackman. 😁
Wolverine v Deadpool when?
.....I like canned cranberry sauce
Ryan wins because at least he’s still Deadpool
well time for Wolverine VS deadpool animated voiced by those 2
Any "Forgiveness" video with Ryan Reynolds isn't complete without Anna Faris' song from "Just Friends".
I thought they were going apologize for Van Helsing and Van Wilder respectively.
thє fírѕt thíng thσught whєn ѕαw thє títlє wαѕ "fσrgívєnєѕѕ íѕ mσrє thαn ѕαчíng ѕσrrч guч"
Well, wolverine chopped that x-man’s head off, so....
i love this well done
Ryan’s side all the way
Yes daddy
You want forgiveness? Get religion.
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry. Forgiveness, means accepting people's flaws. To forgive is devine, so let's have a glass of wine...
hmmm, sick kids, or more coffee for coffee shop tool bags?
The Wolverine vs Deadpool "issue". Truly, the fight of the century? ;)
Hugh Jackman is awesome. A fantastic actor and man of true quality and wit. That Ryan Reynolds is far, far, far, superior in every regard, is nothing at all to be ashamed of.
You want forgiveness? Get religion.
he`s wolverine.. he wins.
I can’t choose lol
And before the black nano cloud killed everyone at the real world they torttured all living for years, before eating them out. POSE NOW AS REAL HUMANS, HOW COULD IT END?
Did Hugh Jackman go back about 30 years? He looks so young
Just absolute top 2 bros,keep shittin on each other.love it
Oh I'm not picking I love you both, but got to say I love my man Jackman damn it.
Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon, better watch out!
The irony in this video is of the f**king charts!
Me realizing that we will never got to see these 2 as Logan and Wade Wilson really  make me hate this year even more
uhh your 80% subscriber watch this
I love these two
they really take the wolverine vs deadpool thing to the next lvl
you want forgiveness , get religon
Will Jimmy Kimmel & Matt Damon make a similar forgiveness video one day?
ALL MY HOMIES LIKE RYAN REYNOLDS
Deadpool x Wolverine
Finally some celebrities doing something funny and worthwhile instead of cringey and selfish.
haha i love when these two role play like this , gives me joy 😂😊
Imagine a Wolverine and Deadpool movie
I’m with Ryan
The virgin Jimmy Kimmel vs Matt Damon feud vs  The Chad Ryan Reynolds  and Hugh Jackman rivalry
They could of got in costume for the video for a cheeky crossover 😎
Forgivenessssss is more than saying sorry.... 🎶
Beef and Porridge Pie
i thought hugh was rick astley
Who the hell is the guy on the left
promoting forgiveness by not forgiving.    i love this world.
I've only watched Mr Ryan Reynolds for 2 minutes and 2 videos but I already love him.
The distinct boundary appropriately drop because cause emotionally signal about a third faucet. wiggly, helpless hubcap
Wolverine and deadpool
They both look like they’re trying really hard not to bust out their claws and katanas, respectively.
Obviously I’m gonna team with Ryan
Im on Ryan Reynolds team.
So One guys helping everybody drink coffee while the other is helping sick kids this is a pretty hard choice
Hey Ry, I know your brother, Jeff. Awesome guy. He's smart, handsome, a good friend and talented... You guys couldn't be more different!!
What a hoot
I can never forgive green lantern.
This channel is what the internet was made for two people having dick measuring contests
wolvie and poolie just being themselves
How have these guys not made a movie together?
Wade is that you 😂
i always have hugh at home... phillips hue...
Hugh Jackman >>>> Ryan Reynolds
these both
I took pictures with their cardboard cut outs
Forgiveness...it’s more then saying sorry!
This differences started with Deadpool and Wolverine or it's beyond that?...
I love these two. They just keep getting better.
that description tho
Merry Holidays
None of us are good. We have all sinned. We’ve lied, stolen, cheated, used God’s name in vain, etc. We are guilty of breaking God’s commandments. The payment for that is Hell because God is a Holy Judge who must punish sin according to His Holiness. The good news is Jesus died for our sins and can set us free from our punishment IF we repent from our sinful ways and believe that He died on the cross, was buried, and rose the third day, and follow Him for the rest of our lives. We can either accept Jesus’s payment for our sins and go free, OR… we will have to pay for our sins on our own in Hell. Either way, someone has to pay because nothing is free. The choice is ours. We must be perfect to go to heaven. So because none of us are perfect, we must rely on Jesus’s perfection to get us there. He never sinned, and because of that He is our only way to Heaven, no one else can get us there. Our good deeds cannot get us there because they will never be good enough.  What to pray: Dear God, I am a sinner and need forgiveness. I believe that Jesus Christ shed His precious blood and died for my sin. I am willing to turn from sin. I now invite Christ to come into my heart and life as my personal Saviour.  Read the King James Bible, get baptized and fellowship with Born Again Christians who are serious about the faith.  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10)  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; (Romans 3:23)  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16)
I still say gin in my coffee makes sure everyone wins. 😊
Deadpool revive wolvorine.
:3
Dude the moment where Ryan says, friends, loved ones, and also hated ones. Genius whoever wrote this is a genius.
‘4
I am so not taking a side... First of all.... I could not choose.... Second... and because of that, let the feud continue for a while ;)
Can this joke just die already? It’s obvious these two love each other have been married for years and have 3 beautiful children together. End the charade men. It’s madness!
All of a sudden, this satanist is on every other TV ad. First, I'm not weak minded, so I don't follow celebs, hanging on their every word. Second, they could care less about children. They're Satanists. They do these ads to look good. No thanks!
This is just a long running joke thats budget is too high
...where's jake?
Great actors
Ok so we gonna get wolverine vs Deadpool
Vera maari these guys!!! Awesome
Is it too much to ask for both
but shut love,  no , we stand ep, strong, that ever shit, wont define us
I love how Hugh wants us to support coffee while Ryan wants us to support sick kids in need. Those 2 things just don't seem that even to me.
This guy did not allow me to skip add😭😭
I like canned cranberry sauce.
For hating each other they spent hell of a lot time together.
Hugh wins. jk.(please dont kick down my door)
#Bromance
0:22 We all know it man he is a wolf like The Wolverine
Hugh Jackman 🙋🏻‍♀️ He plays a far cooler superhero.
Reminds me of my 2 cats
forgiveness is more than saying sorry
I don’t wanna pick they are amazing
F@#K Logan. this is what we should have gotten in the 3rd Wolverine movie
Or you can fist fight and I don't have to get a Sams Club membership.
This is ingenious! Regardless of who you pick, Sam's Club wins either way! It's a win-win!
Come on fellas your both terrible.
Ryan...You and Hugh should repent now!! We know of your plans...JESUS CHRIST IS KING...YOU WILL NOT WIN THE WAR YOU WANT....
Crap I voted for Hugh, and the vote counted for Ryan.😄
Sickening.  For those who don’t know...Sam’s Club is named after Sam Walton and is Walmart’s answer to Costco (who actually treat their employees well).  That these usually decent people would shill for an outfit like this is a disgrace.  No one should care a whit about what kind of “charity “ Sams Club is tied to when Walmart keeps their employees at starvation level wages and is the biggest corporate welfare Queen in U.S. history.  Shame on the two of you for engaging with this monstrous outfit.
But....I like canned cranberry sauce !
NO ONE WINS WHEN WOLVERINE AND DEADPOOL GET TOGETHER....at least in theory ..maybe try this out in movie to be sure?
love to see you both in a same movie
Wolverine and Deadpool together again😍
I side with Ryan, I don’t drink coffee.
Deadpool v/s wolverine
It is like “Sophie’s choice “.  which charity to choose ?
Odd Couple; La Cage a Fal
Lol loved that this is a fight between WOLVERINE and DEADPOOL
this is the way to make an add
I'd support Hugh AND Sickkids if I could.
Love this! I need more.. lol Reminds me of my all time favorite bro- lovehates... Blake Shelton and Jimmy Fallon. 😁
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry
Your mom gay
No one should ever go to Sams club or walmart... :)
It will be the end of the world when Deadpool and Wolverine start to fight to death. We need Chuck Norris to stop them.
Wolverine + Deadpool movie please!!!
Sandwich!!!!! but if I was held at gunpoint...Ryan Reynolds every  time!!!!!
someone give this guys a movie
Ryan you are just the best.
Jeez, get a room you two.
You guys are hilarious and I love the level of friendship that allows you guys to do this.
I have decided who the winner is in this feud. It is me, the viewer, who is, for the first time in history, looking forward to more commercials with these two wonderful actors
This is what we need in a Deadpool x Wolverine movie
I love you Hugh  And you too Reynolds  Please forgive me 😁🥰😋
I like how at the end the commercial cuts Mr. Jackman off mid sentence. It's the little touches that make all the difference.
Canadian gang
I just hope one day, for the last time, I see Hugh as Logan and Deadpool picking on him.
the moment you realise deadpool's biceps are bigger than wolverine
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry!
So what about picking both of these Frienamies? I mean *Shrugs*
🕯️😎✌️
They need to do a buddy comedy together. That would be gold!
awww... I love them both sooo much. Donate to both charities. Love both Hugh and Ryan. Great people with such great talent and humor. Man love at its best. Hugh for PM Australia and Ryan for PM of Canada......just a thought. USA...sorry its to late....your to long gone. You have trump.....for now... sorry....
I feel like the is heavily in Ryan’s favor, he’s donating to sick kids and Hugh is helping coffee workers
Nooooooo, their video description was gonna be my comment.   "They're too dangerous to be left alive".
Who ever replies to me I’ll side with
I hope they have huge jackman in Deadpool 3 somehow after watching a few of their ads together
Too hot men
Is Ryan and Jack gay? Are they together .....? Is this a love-hate relationship? I wish they would be gay......they could have such beautiful babies together.
Love ❤️
only one word: Wolverine
I will pay a trillion billion dollars, to see a hugh, ryan and norm skit.  Check is already signed Ryan.  The Green Lantern lets me know I have ur attention. <3
how can you ever choose between the two. wtf!!
Sorry Ryan, I love you too,but I’m supporting the farmers. (I already support my local kids)
I only clicked on this because I saw Reynolds and the word forgiveness. I thought this was a Hamilton thing. I actually thought for a second that Maria Reynolds' husband's name was Ryan.
You Want Forgiveness Get Religion      -Bully Maguire
This comes from an Australian and Hugh you started the war when you sealed deadpools mouth in origins.  This is on you mate. You started this barny.
I wonder how many outtakes this took?
With enemies like this, who needs friends!
Hugh is still so young and after watching him in ' The Wolverine ' I thaught he would have been in his 40s
I like how he can make such an emotional subject fumny but important, ur a godsent ryan
Well can't make up my mind so I'll be helping the sick farmers this time
Sick kids or coffee farmers. How about get the sick kids to farm coffee and can be just one charity.
i am the gatekeeper, are you the key master?
Sí disappointed you didn’t sing Forgiveness 😔💔
I love you Hugh but....coffee farmers....or kids with cancer and such.....jeeeeeeze that's not a hard call there buddy.
i side with Ryan
If ryan reynolds do all commercial in youtube then I’ll never skip the advertisement.
eu amo demais esse homem!!!
It's all because Hugh didn't want to be Wolverine once more. Lol.
Canned cranberry sauce - canberry sauce - is the correct way to eat the confection. >_>
Hugh don't take this too personally okay but Australia should be set on fire California style with the amount of spiders none of you seem bothered by. And Ryan...well I just don't really like Canada. JK best love to both of you.
I like how they're 6 feet apart
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorrrry!
🤣
Why did they give them such short chairs? their shin bones were taller than the chairs.
Wait... do people not love canned cranberry sauce?
How long before they make Wolverine & Deadpool movie.
What this guys are doing, and the way they found out to do it...is awesome...
I hate to sound like a total classic mom, but I can't decide. You both freaking win
there'll be no peace—between Wolverine and Deadpool.
I love this so much i didnt even realize this is a sams club ad
Bud I like both missletoe and canned cranberry sauce... ;_;  =p
HUGE JACKEDMAN
Ryan's channel is nothing but ads but its great
Would be funny if Ryan said  “And if you vote for me. We’ll make deadpool 3.”
We REALLY need him to play Wolverine one more time, but this time in a Deadpool movie
In this day and age, I need comedy relief. Jackman and Reynolds deliver, thanks guys.
I desperately need some onscreen Wolverine/Deadpool action.
Team Wolverine 4-ever :-D
Can i do both
"The Canned Cranberry of human beings" hahahaha.
These commercials are AWESOM.
1 million views for but mumble rappers on the other hand......I no longer have faith in society anymore. Let them burn.
Where tf is the Deadpool X Wolverine movie
Well some people will pick a side, assholes won't and beautiful people will chose both.
So wolverine vs. deadpool?
Their rivalry is like that of Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel I love it
Literally my brother basically disowned my mom on Thanksgiving. Thanks for a bother and mother that hate eachother.
Wow.
The real life wolverine and the real life Deadpool perfect their relationship is wolverine and Deadpool
The sexual tension these to have with each other
this friendship is EVERYTHING
This is much harder than the jacob or edward dispute.
Hugh must be hard up for friends.  How could anyone call Ryan a friend .. contributed to the blm/antifa bail fund .. no money for the families and businesses who suffered from the riots
They love each other more than their wives love them
Hey Reynolds....you beautiful little girl. I love how you gave that initial aura that you were anti estab until the cas came in and now you're ...buying soccer teams or something. You're more fake than a fleshlight.
I thought they were gonna apologize for that one awful Wolverine Origins movie.
I paid for a 3 month plan and I have received nothing for my 81.87you would think a big shot like this guy would at least send his people to some kind of school with the money they refused to send back so just remember your giving your money away when you get a mint mobile plan here's a few that i have had no pleasure talking to,ileen,johoco,eddy,lorenand now this was on the 16th here it is the30th and we have edd ,freddy and Miguel  and big suprise not data no money even offered ,mint sucks
Why not both? dan dannn dDAN DaNdAN!!!!
Hugh has very long shins. How do you feel about your shins, Ryan?
Jimmy Kimmel vs Matt Damon > Hugh Jackman vs Ryan Reynolds
Man this is going to be tough, I think the only wise decision to win my vote and for me to choose which one is my overall favorite I think we are to do Deadpool 3 and Hugh you need to put the clause back on and play wolverine at least one more time if you can do that you will most likely get my vote. What do you say? And I’m not talking some stupid little three second cameo with wolverine no I’m talking about the dynamic duo getting together and stomp some ass. come on, what do you got to lose except millions of dollars for not doing it. you have no idea how many fans would be ecstatic, And with all the crap that’s been going on the world lately, if you guys could just come together and do Deadpool three with wolverine, you would give so many of us joy in these dark times. Sorry I couldn’t resist throwing a pity party
Canned Cranberry sauce is the best-- fight me Jackman.  Mistletoe does make things awkward.   #TeamRyan
Ryan Can You send me 50$ so i could make my father's Birthday Memorable! ( due to covid i have o job.)
Deadpool and Wolverine :)
*friendship goal*
Sorry, just not sure what to think of Hugh with clothes on. I mean,..I get it, he’s an actor, but how do we know when he’s telling the truth?
But I like canned cranberry sauce
Where is Jake Gyllenhaal?
I vote for Hugh Jackman!!!!!!!!
get a movie already, or three at least !!
I love dying kids and I love coffee so it’s a win win
you are equale
And how has this not proven that there needs to be a Deadpool and wolverine movie with these two
Also hated ones....
"You want forgiveness? Get religion"
I have one rule
Thanks for all the laughs guys.  Please keep them coming, there’s an entire month left in this “year of horrors”, so we can use all the laughs we can get!  😎
Go Ryan Reynolds
I wonder if their greeting is a punch to the face by one of them, followed by a sucker punch to the gut by the other, an awkward loathing stare, and then a laugh as a finish their Aviation American Gin. Please make this a movie.
I think I have to go with the sick kids, I hate coffee.
they hate fuck.
I dont do Sams cause walmart ...but renolds, all day, every day
0:11
Plot twist, they weren't in the same room - they're green screened from opposite sides of the world 😂
Thats cool, I have had sick kids be so excited to remember. Mr.Jackman's excited face turned to his 👨 🤔 father.
I'm absolutely in, we need more sick kids!
Not I feel the Holidays are here
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
“Canned Cranberry sauce of human beings.” 🤣
I can’t choose! Please don’t make me choose!
the best thing celebrities gave us all year 😭
Wolverine vs Deadpool classic
❤️Hugh❤️
What can men do against such reckless hate?
Ryan u da best
You guys are the best
How can you two argue you both have death scenes in different movies with the same song.
Omg your mouth Deadpool ❤️✈️ fan of your mouth
How is Ryan falling behind you guys?
Well im Canadian so i will vote for Reynolds, like they said ''buy locally'' even if Jackman is a better actor 😛... lets see if Ryan respond aboat that ouhhh !! Still weird my profil picture here is with the signer and the guitarist of Parkway Drive 2 Australian guys i mean like Jackman
Que bonita amistad viva CANADÁ y sus especímenes 💕🤣😆👍na los amo alos dos maravillosas personas 🇲🇽❤️😌
I love this feud! It is absolutely the best!!!!
_forgiveness... can you imagine?_
For goodness sake stop it the pair of you
are these guys supposed to be funny
just a reminder... Jackman killed off (indirectly and possibly unknowingly) "Beetlejuice the Musical" on Broadway this year...
I love the rivalry bits you both do. It's fun. You guys make a good duo. Even if either of you can't be in a Marvel film together, you both need to make original action comedy. OMG, a buddy cop film would rock. Ok, I have to go watch Lethal Weapon again for the millionth time.
Ryan is backing a colorado company !
Ryan Reynolds can F off. Jackman FTW.
Awesome Video!!!!Awesome Creation!!!!
So Noone is going to talk about the thicc coffee farmer we just saw 🤤🤤
Love these two their Friendship comes through constantly
love both of them in entertainment, however even more because they are working to change a world that has has so many problems. we need people like you in the world.
I love cranberry sauce!
Love these guys
cant get more Canadian than that....
How they can't crack up doing this... We need out takes.
Love y'all but now I'm definitely not shopping at Sam's Club... Holidays shouldn't be about buying more stuff
Hugh Jackman is a demon Ryan Reynolds is a sexy sexy angel
I love Deadpool
You 2 are excellent together. As for chosing: Ryan, youre funny, but Hugh is funny AND makes my ovaries boil. I dont care about the children. Id choose Hugh anyday, anyhow...
Put the relevant links in the comments!
♥
You both need to get together and do remake of PAINT YOUR WAGON  mentioned to Hugh and he loved idea
Nice... but plz its Christmas
great, where once i loved you both, now I hate you both.... thanks a lot you jack-arses! 👍 'd    #Paxus Rating: ☆☆☆  ½
sick kids foundation.. not a good name
We want this crossover but in marvel. I hope deadpool 3 has a a cameo from Hugh jackman as himself kicking dead pools ass. 😂
These two remind me of the rivalry between platypus Perry and Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz !
This would be a tough choice and I love you both, but I've been sober for almost 2 years now so I'm gonna have to support Laughing Man Coffee. Sorry Ryan. Maybe you could start an exotic juice mix company and I could support both haha
Canned Cranberry Sauce is awesome, Hugh....
They should have an argument where they start fighting each other, then Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel drop by and they start fighting against these :P
I hate to love you.  P.S. Ryan Jackman and Hugh Reynolds
Y'know, I was having a hard time deciding until Hugh referred to canned cranberry sauce in a derogatory manner, when it is clearly the superior option.  Congratulations, Ryan "Canned Cranberry Sauce" Reynolds!
Sorry Hugh, but Ryan is helping sick children :'(
They need a movie with Logan/Wolverine & Deadpool ASAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP  Deadpool vs Wolverine? Or a “Hobbs vs Shaw“ type movie? Idc, either way, Deadpool x Wolvy would stomp all over Hobbs vs Shaw.
just to be clear no ones actually picking a side because we of course love them both
wish i could give money, but me having epilepsy, i''m not allowed a job, and the government doesn't even pay me... I'm living off my mums money :/ so sorry xxxxx
I love the fact that their relationship is exactly like wolverine and deadpool’s
The fact we will never see these 2 play wolverine and deadpool in the same movie is a tragedy
I think most people do not know that this channel exists, otherwise it would have had more subscribers.  like me
All this just because someone decided to pair these two together in X-Men Origins
Can we just get a legit arm wrestle going between them?
Love these guys
I'm not forgiving either of you for becoming corporate shills for Walmart....
Hi look here a dying person give me money and we dont even see the money being used to help
You two are great together..,.if only there was a movie we could cast you  both in....
The Frenemies we deserve.
I feel as if Reynolds and Jackman will one day have to play in a movie akin to "Grumpier/Grumpy Old Men"
Ryan renalds is the best after ever
i pick ryan
"Forgive this, asshole!" *throat punch*
As much as I want to help sick farmers and whatnot, how does one donate money to the Bring Jackman for Deadpool Foundation (BJDP Foundation, not to be confused with the Blow Jobs and Deep Penetration Foundation)
And then they f@cked.
*Ryan and Rob McElhenny talk about their new ownership of Wrexham AFC* - https://youtu.be/OhGatNZx0t8  Hugh Jackman is currently in talks to buy rivals Chester City FC
Wow so either I choose sick children or coffee plantation workers
i live ryan but im a aussie so im legally obligated to go hugh
Love is in a AIR❤
Cmon guys..wolverine and deadpool movie... think about it?
Can we get a deadpool or wolverine plushies? All proceeds manfucatured by the hands of little children
Can we get Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel next?
You guys are awesome funny
God I want to see a deadpool and wolverine movie..........
Why didn't you sing forgiveness is about never saying sorry
lol What is with all of these hilariously adorable ads?  Is this a thing to donate to the most charities or?
I like canned cranberries@ Ryan/Deadpool I love you
these guys are great:-)
I only realised afterwards that this truly did put a smile on my face.
Dueling charities, I like it.
why not both? lol
Hmm so those charitable donations at Sam's Club I would assume works as a tax write off for the corporation? Donate directly to the charity if you want to help.
We need to see wolverine vs Deadpool
See the problem is some people can’t get gin and most people can get coffee
If this is as close as these two asshats can get to doing a Wolverine/Deadpool movie then I gues I'll take the small win... For now.  @Dresden.H. paitently waits for the greatest movie of all time to be made...  On some distant sunny day... Honestly i just want to see if Wolverine's salty sack grows back after Deadpool chops them off... I mean... Deadpool has made referrence to Wolerine's "lil bag-of-horrors" in the past so logic would dictate that Deadpool will most definatly attemp to claim a prized Austrailian treasure.
😅🤣
Hugh wins sorry Ryan
Love u huge Jackman❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😁
Why can't we all get along?
I have a feeling these bisexual kings have crushes on each other.
I always loved watching these with my twin brother. He always loved to  laugh at the humor in anything Ryan Reynolds ever did. Sadly though he  has passed away on November 11, 2020. Thank you for every video you post  and thank you for letting me post this.
What a weird feud. Third world coffee growers vs sick children, FIGHT!
https://youtu.be/DpjeRTMPvJo  Nightwing. I hate you... .. . Jaxx is the focus. . Get me out of this life
"The canned cranberry sauce of people"  Im dead.

But I love you both! How could I ever choose!?!
Am I the only one who thought they would be singing “forgiveness” from the just friends movie?! It’s funny cause Canadians hate no one
I most say, this was epic. Well done Sam's Club!
I CANT CHOOSE AAAAAAAAAA I love them both
I'm playing both sides so I always come out on top
Im not sure my heart can take such amazing content...
Now i need to get a sams club membership. You know what? Im not even mad
sam please beat me with your club
Ryan, you're either looking a bit jaundice or putting on too much fake tan. Best wishes, either way.
I immediately thought of "Forgiveness" from the movie Just Friends which ryan reynolds is in  https://youtu.be/13mUFEXnB54
What if you have a Costco membership?
"An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's Club... and only one got out?
I love that they're trying to help others while being very funny!   Thanks guys!!
Feel like Ryan is gonna win, mainly cause he's had bigger movies lately and his charity is sick kids... vs coffee farmers. This might just be a landslide.
Americas two favourite Canadians just in time for the holiday 🇨🇦🙃🎅🏿🤶
Feels like they are trying to work out a chemistry between them for a wolverine/deadpool movie
This is how marketing should be done
You know that Ryan knew that there would be all the "Just Friends" references when he titled this posting...
I feel like my parents got divorced and they are making me pick which parent I have to live with. It's a hard choice  because dad has no money after paying for moms house for her and her new boyfriend. On the other moms boyfriend has a pencil thin mustache and is always asking if you need help with your bath time.  I'M 15 CHET! Sorry just trying to say I love you both.
Ryan is half Boomer half Zoomer
Wolwerine is dead
This guy does acting, wholesale and even cellphone carrier
ohh, they love each other
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry- Samantha
Hugh and I share a birthday so sorry Ryan ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
While I do not shop Sams Club, I do love your videos!
Dear Marvel, please....PLEASE....just give us one Jackman/Wolverine Deadpool movie. Just one. It's all we ask. PLEASE!!!
Sorry Hugh, you are amazing but... Ryan is also amazing! Alright so.. if I have to choose one.. I gotta pick Matthew McConaughey, alright? Alright.
Hugh Ryan Reynolds has been annoying my voicemails https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQPLGakv2e1Kf85VZ3j3JfHnJ_h2lkKI coffee?
Lol I like canned cranberry sauce
Lol I like canned cranberry sauce
someone needs to cast these two in a comedy film together, as hollywood loves remakes i think lethal weapon we be a good fit.
Wales is awesomely, I wondered if you and your better half, her films are awesome........just watched simple favour...awesome
Oh for fucks sake, will y'all just get a room already!? 😂
i want to send sick kids to pick coffee
Love these guys ❤️ 🤘
Wow these guys are just amazing people & hilarious. Just giving & giving.
these 2 are the best together
And here I was thinking this was another Aviator Gin commercial!
We got the Wolverine/Deadpool rivalry, just not in the way we expected
I whole heartedly Love you both!!
I love canned cranberry sauce
If you have enemies like this you don't need friends
Awwh dang... I shop Costco. But tis the season and I shall give.
...is more than sayin sorry...sorry ha ha!
Love
Both fantastic charities. Sick kids saved my life so Im a bit biased lol
Clearly, a lot of effort went into writing the description.
these two are genius at marketing
I always want to ask god， how can these two love birds not married with each other？！
Ryan for days
I like canned cranberry sauce
Except, Sam's Club/WalMart has horrible employment practices. So, no.
I’ve NEVER seen any A list actor who allow themselves to be silly.  It’s refreshing. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ryan
i like canned cranberry sauce
He looks so weird without a beard
Hugh: were gonna help coffee farmers  Ryan: were helping sick kids  Me: why would you twist my arm like this?
😅😅😅😅😅
I. CAN’T. CHOOSE.
I See Wolverine And Deadpool.
There was a second I thought they tried to kill each.…....ohhhh NVm.....
Hahaha they're forgiving each other because of Sam's Club after all
Hated ones lol
Or Walmart/Sam's Club can just send the $ themselves from the Billions they've made off the backs of the factory workers and the underpaying their own employees.
Sorry Ryan, I'm Team Hugh.
You can confirm that Ryan is the canned cranberry sauce of human beings Like mistletoe, Hugh makes everything awkward  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I prefer ryan but i like coffee more than i like children
I wouldn't mind having people who hated me around me. If they were Hugh and Ryan, ofcourse.
Lets just give these guys a moment and commend them for how awesome this whole feud is between them :)
WE NEED A MOVIE WITH THESE 2
Cant choose
I gotta go with Ryan, HOW dare you diss cranberries...😱 Good day sir.  I said GOOD DAY!
Now this is how you do a clickable ad
I like Ryan.....but I like coffee more.
I'm going to side with Wolverine, he's a badass Canadian
Deadpools Dream: can we take a shit on the MCU? for some mildly r rated post credit humor? 🤣
Just make the Wolverine and Deadpool Movie already! Its the only way you two will become friends again and properly I dont want a repeat of Origins!
Ryan Reynolds is a national treasure
These two.....  Parson me while I go out and enroll as a Sam's Club member.
Sick kids or coffee farmers.  Both have a special place in my heart.  Seriously though, if you guys can't just support both, maybe both of you suck?
Not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed that Ryan didn’t say that mistletoe is a toxic parasite...
I'd drink a beer with both of them.
Gotta Love the bromance
I'm Team Reynolds All the way, but I don't have a Sam's Member (I know, it 2020, how it even possible?)   But In Keeping of Team Sick Kids Foundation, I have already Donated to Dell Children's Hospital
you know what the funny thing is, on the website to vote it says you have to pick a state in america to live i but neither of them ae american
Me: Sees title of the video and Ryan Reynolds on the thumbnail. Also Me: Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry. (I'm so sorry.) To forgive is divine, so let's have a glass of wine and have make up s*x until the end of time (x5) time!
Do a team-up movie. You're welcome....ps, this makes me an exec now btw.
awwwwwww Just make a Wolverine & Deadpool movie already!! 😂
Ahhh <3
Oh you two 😂😂
A movie with them will be incredible
Holiday season? Did you mean Ryan/Hugh ‘feud’ update season?
I was expecting forgiveness from just friends
Hatred is beautiful, these guys are proof :)
Awesome
You can tell these guys are besties
Its more than just saying sorry
This relationship unneseserly open to public
The canned cranberry sauce of human beings! Lol 😆 🤣 😂
Wolverine meets Deadpool 😀😂
Ryan you are gay, you were good in van wilder tho 👍
That really looked improvised haha 😆
that is the superior bromance
Wondering how many people would tune in to see a 'KSI vs Logan Paul' kind of 'match up' between these two, but they 'fight' by drinking their own beverages...WHO WILL WIN?!? Coffeeman or the Ginnernator? Last man standing, one who jitters so much he can vibrate through time and the other with liver damage...
I like wolverine better but if were talking about actors Ryan Reynolds
It began with X-Men.  Then it was a long chain of memes of entertainment.  Then the Ryan-Hugh rivalry felt similar to Tom Holland and Anthony Mackie's rivalry...  *_We're gonna need a movie with Ryan and Hugh Jackman being together..._*
Wolverine and Deadpool as an X-men team besides Hugh says (I guess Stryker found a way to make Wade shut up)
OHH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST WEAR THE DAMN SUPER SUITS, AND START TEARING EACH OTHER APART ALREADY!!!!!
LOL love you guys both. If I cant get deadpool vs wolverine. This is my next best thing. Thanks for the laughs guys, keep them coming :)
Social distancing: made for Hugh and Ryan.  Also, I'm team Hugh.
Thus entire story line is better than green lantern
Ryan😍
🤣🤣i was just scrolling random YouTube VIDEO, got this recommend, n found out this two dudes r jus having their GOOD times LOL 😂🤣😹. Such a good friend.
Who in the shit is downvoting this?!
Ah the holidays, a great time to be passive aggressive
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry. Forgiveness, means accepting people's flaws. To forgive is devine, so let's have a glass of wine. And have make up sex, until the end of time (time, time, time)  -SAMANTHA JAMES
So 2 rich white guys want us poor people to donate our cash?  How much are they donating?
0:12 when you realize you weren’t subscribed to Ryan Reynalds on YouTube...
You guys are the best showing the world humor laughter friendship and forgiveness with love and joy matter first in life thank you thank you thank you happy holidays guys love you both
I wait till the whole video to complete, even after logo too. Just to make sure I didn't missed any of the rayn😂

It takes two awesome actors to have so much fun acting like jerks
#Hughjackmanasjamsebond
I have a movie idea I believe you would be perfect for not only to star in but also Direct
Forgiveness. It's more than saying sorry.
Did anyone else come here expecting/hoping this to be a cover song from the movie Just Friends?
I wanna be in the Timeline where they made a GOOD Wolverine movie with Deadpool 😭
You're asking women to choose between Deadpool or Wolverine? Are y'all TRYING to cause millions of women to have emotional breakdowns? 😳
I know these two are actors and they're just pretending to hate each other, but dear God these two are hilarious when they're "arguing".
Hey everyone! I just got into watching the Deadpool/X-Men movies, after slaming them for forever,  and just wanted to say that i love them all!  Anyway I side with Deadpool.
All I thought when I saw the title was Anna Faris’ song from Just Friends.
It’s not even thanksgiving
Canned cranberry sauce of human beings 😂
Are these marketing ideas his or someone elses ... I mean they/he  created a channel full of ads yet I love most of them... Yeah you read it right . Some of them you know
i love it
1:00- 1:09, And a time to capitalize on the emotional state that the holidays puts people in. I swear every year I think my heart comes closer to being 3 sizes too small because of holiday advertising shoving giant candy canes up my ass the day after Halloween.
I hate to admit, but this time the australian wins. Kind of...   Love your attitude guys. :)
give us a wolverine and deadpool movie nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

I feel like this is all a ploy by Reynolds to guilt Hugh into playing Wolverine again.  Better be.
Forgiveness...   Is more than saying sorry...   To forgive is divine,  So let's have a glass of wine, And some make up sex, 'Till the end of time time time time time   (time) :)
Team jackman all the way.
ahhhh i love it how you hate each other keep it up
Team Hugh
Coffee communities vs sick kids.   Not really equal footing.
you guys are awesome
Hugh jack man looks like he is about to scream like wolverine and jump at me whenever he talks i dont knw i get that feeling
Closest Deadpool vs Wolverine Crossover we will get
Siding with Ryan
I kinda like how they are doing this instead of preparing to ask forgiveness from God alot of real shits about to hit soon
My favorite celebrity couple
......can I choose Patrick Stewart?
Anyone else thought that this was a Just Friends reference.
But I'm a Costco guy
Kinda disappointed not to hear "Samantha James' Forgiveness" in the background, ha-ha.  BTW, "Just Friends" is the BEST Christmas movie ever!
I’m a straight man but I would pay any amount to see these guys hate bang
Maximum effort, bubs.
I mean I’ve been buying Aviation Gin for about a year and a half now. What’s the other thing? Laughing? La-Laughing Man’s? Coffee?
Dude..... y'all guys look great together 😂😌😌😌
Enemies today, lovers tomorrow. Just sayin....
I like Australians more than I do Canadians. Hugh it is.
Even though they hate each other , they are able to set aside theirs differences for charity. Respect
The Ryan and Hugh's friendship is absolutely incredible and the level of irony and humor is truly unbelievable!
Love ya mates Scott Western Australia
It's so hard to remember that this is a bit sometimes because their acting is fucking insane.
Those two need couples therapy...well...Ryan has needed some kind of therapy for quite a while now but...:)
It’s really hard to choose one of them as your favorite
Awww. You can just feel the love to hate each other thru the screen. 😍 these two man who love to be charitable have toward each other. Just like most holiday awarkward moments. 🥰🎄🎁😡💢😡
bahahahaha
This is just remind me PC vs Mac ad
Best fake-frenemies real-friends in the world. Merry Christmas 🎄
Just a very concerned citizen passing by your comment section. Please check out Cagayan, Philippines. We really need your help due to the typhoon Ulysses. Please help me pray for them 🙏🙏🙏
You guys would make excellent ambassadors for CANZUK.
Those two aren't friends. No, these are what you call best friends.
Imagine wolverine and deadpool movie 😍
Can I get one for Christmas 🎄
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry 🎶🎶
Jake Gyllenhaal: so,  anyone's up for the ugly sweater party this year?
I’d choose the coffee I dislike gin but I’d have the coffee with Ryan lol
wish i had a friend
two charming people shit idk who to pick
Seeing Awkward Hugh and Miserable Ryan today just makes my day. A gentle reminder that no matter how hot your wife is you're still gonna remain miserable.   Thanks Ryan
"You want forgiveness? Get religion."  -Bully Maguire
😆😆 Why not both? 🤷
I'm siding with whatever Ryan says cause i like his every single movie i watched
Why isn't hugh wearing 'only RMWs'? X)
I like canned cranberry sauce.
Ryan technique of success just add hugh Jackman in every thumbnail
Two great blokes....
Ah yes. Talking about Christmas when it's not even Thanksgiving yet.
lol
If you look correctly Ryan Reynolds can ruin anyone any time its more like he worked so much on it👍👍
In a parallel universe -  Wolverines vs Deadpool on big screen  🔥
two very awesome people
Cute!
Thanks guys 🍾🖕🏽🍆👍🏽✌🏽
Don't ever let this "feud" die
Y'all are too stinking cute with ya rivalry an all. 😉😉😉 keep up the good work!!!!
We get it guys. Just put Wolverine and Deadpool in a movie together.
So, who's gonna win? Wolverine or Deadpool?
ill take all ya stocks
These two are immortal, and so is throat their living meme.
Isn't friendship beautiful? 😂😂😂
Hugh Jackman will always be favourite actor/ human being of all time!
#Stopthesteal
Am I the only who thought that they would have maximized the donations by tongue kissing in this video?  I'm contributing to both worthty causes, but if the kiss had happened I would have auctioned all my kids and given the whole proceeds!
🤟🏻😻🤟🏻😻HUGHJACKMA
"Or Ryan, the canned-craberry sauce of human beings" YOU WIN HUGH!
i want this kind of friendship in my life lmao these guys are awesome
Deadpool deadpool deadpool deadpool
😁😀❤🌍
Ok.... but holy obvious marketing, Batman.
Cant you two just get a room so we can all move on?
Every time I get the notification that you uploaded I know it's going to be an advertisement but I still watch and still enjoy. If you two don't found the greatest marketing company the world has seen I'ma stop liking your videos. You have until your next upload to comply or I'm thumbs downing it and no one can stop me.
I shop at Costco, so y'all gonna have to sort this out on your own.
These two are legends 🔥
This is what all ads shld be like
Their friendship is legendary
Don't mess with Wolverine, bro.
You both suck and are awesome! Like that bizarre casserole, your aunt that no one talks to brings to a holiday dinner and yet you find it delicious. 8)
Why must wolverine and deadpool fight? They have so much in common.
When will Wolverine and Deadpool just give it up and just hug?
I wish I had a friendship like you two have
But I love them both I can't choose!! XD
Ryan is gonna win by a landslide given the charity that he's backing.
Hugh's couch is struggling to contain his greatness while Ryan's is chillin...
I'm sorry Hugh but canned cranberry sauce is the far superior version.
Can Ryan dance and sing? I know Hugh can. If Ryan doesn't - I'm team Hugh Jackman.
“U want forgiveness get religion”
These two are hands down the best at this ever, lmao every time...
✨💖✨Choose?  You want me to CHOOSE?   Holy moly!  Sure!  Put it on us to feed your feud.  No more Mr. Nice Guys.  Sheesh.  Seriously, though, thank you on so many levels.  The charity work you do warms my heart.  (Almost as much as the __Maximum Jackman__ video.)  And I wasn’t aware that Sam’s Club did mail orders.  Even without the pandemic, I live in a remote area and rely on online shopping.  Without it, I’d be running through the woods naked.  And at my age, that would be a very scary thing.  We also had over a foot of snow in the past few days.  Brrrr.  (Note to other viewers: I know Mr. Jackman and Mr Reynolds  couldn’t possibly read all these comments, but I just had to put my love and admiration out there.)  ✨💖✨
Never forgive Ryan, stay at emotional immaturity forever 😂
Now do a dead pool and Wolverine movie please
We REALLY need a Deadpool v Wolverine movie
Easily the best fake frenemies bromance ever.
I love these. 👍
Hugh and Ryan: hey we are from country known for there relaxed casual nature, let pretend we are evil bastards to each other cause it’s bloody funny.  Everyone: GENIUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love those two guys so much!!! I wish they were my friends 😔 😢
Ryan purposely putting out ads we do wanna watch, evil genius.
Didn't even know they had beef with each other!
I vote Ryan Reynolds.
من هنا عربي
Why choose when I can have it all???? 😂😂🤷🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Hugh just acts like an Aussie dealing with an American. And Ryan is just savagely creative, They are just both brilliant.
Wolverine always!!!
deadpool and wolverine
PLEASE BRING DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE AWESOME ADVENTURES TO LIFE! Then I'll contribute...
What kind of sick monstrous psychopath dislike this video...
they should make out
That we never got to see Hugh's wolverine vs Ryan's (real) deadpool is a cinematic travesty
Why are over a million people subscribed to a channel that is JUST commercials. These are JUST COMMERCIALS.
😂
There is no more iconic duo than these 2. They’re the best friends I’ve ever seen
Huge just makes things awkward 😂
Ryan Reynolds is the best, his hair is the same color as my teeth.
please make a movie together! ...exactly about THAT!
too bad Canadians cant vote
do people actually care about this 'feud'? i know its a joke and they dont actually hate eachother but like are people so invested in their personal lives that they care about this bit or whatever it is?
FRAK OF GUYS IM CHOOSING BOTH 😂🤣👍
Can I put Ryan's vodka into Hugh's coffee?
I can't not love this. Or anything that comes out of this channel, really. Honestly. This is... this is just amazing.  Oh... and Ryan always wins.
I could not keep my eyes off those chairs, where can I find one?
yea but didn’t wolverine beat deadpool in X-Men: Origins
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just realized how close together Ryan Reynolds' eyes are.
Anyone else start singing the song Forgiveness from the movie just friends before clicking on this video?
I'll always watch a video with wolverine and deadpool
Im not forgiving Ryan Reynolds for tricking me into seeing underground 6, still waiting for an apology.
Can we get those two chained together?  I think that would be great to watch.
Wolverine all the way👍👍
Forgiveness.... is more than sayin' sorry.... SORRY
Liking for Grace and her family. I still think about her often and I can tell Ryan must too. Sick kids is a really great hospital and a worthy cause to support.
Just so we’re clear, I’d gladly catch Covid from either of you.
Wolverine vs. Deadpool has got to happen.
Bring Logan and Deadpool together😭😭
Did not realize there is literally a charity called "sick kids"
I like to pretend that Ryan and Hugh are creative enough to come up with this stuff on their own, but who am I kidding.  <insert evil laugh here>   I am kidding BTW, you guys are great.  Keep up the good work.
I'm with Hugh Jackman.
"The canned cranberry sauce of human beings."
I see what you did there ...
Unpopular opinion but I think Real Steel is a better Hugh Jackman movie then the X-Men movies. I'm sorry I'm sorry
These 2 need to do a comedy together
"Hugh, forgive me, for exposing you for the mONSTER THAT YOU REALLY ARE" I CAN'T BREATH
Just let Wolverine appear in the next Deadpool already!!!!
Wolverine & Deadpool Meet Again...
do those coffee pickers get 15 dollar per hour? or more like 15 dollar a month ? :P making money making money making money :P
I love these guys
Is more than saying sorrrryy
Wolverine vs Deadpool movie please
I know this is a RADICAL thought, but since it's charitable donations anyhow, why not make two, one for Hugh to support coffee growing communities and one for Ryan to support sick children (you just give MORE to the one you really want to support, but shhhh, don't tell them that)!!!
Where the fuck is my wolverine and Deadpool movie?
Sick kids vs coffee farms that ruin the climate by chopping down rainforests. Not realy a choice is it
Sams club advert? cmon dude you're better than this. You and I know damn well that money isn't going to sick kids.
This holiday season vote wether you support farmers or dying kids more.
Wolverine and Deadpool never seem to get along.
ask hugh to do an aviation gin ad
Sounds like me and my friends. "Hey, dumbass, stfu and hold this." God forbid we're ever nice or polite. That's how you know something is really wrong.  What were those charities again?
*A portion of proceeds from Laughing Man Coffee support coffee farmers and their families through the relationship between Laughing Man Coffee and the Laughing Man Foundation? Thanks for letting us know how much if any goes directly to them and not get lost in the ether.  Plus, how is coffee families in foreign countries the high priority listing for charities when all you have to do is look around the corner in LA to see maybe we should prioritize that first. At least the SickKids Foundation appears to help a group that would be in a situation far outside of their control. Ryan Reynolds wins this one.
Happy Diwali ❤️
Can we please have a DEADPOOL VS. WOLVERINE movie please???
I love you Ryan but how dare you! Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. I'm with him till the end.
The should be the stars of Tarinteino's Star Trek.
I`m happy to see you two finally got a room toghether!  ;)
I wonder how long the feud will last. Maybe generations?
Love the small print ♥️
am i about to go get a Sam's club membership 🤔🤔🤔
Damn Ryan pulling out the sick kid card, gotta go that route rather than the coffee damn.
😂
i want a movie, which collab of wolverine & deadpool.
Haha love you guys.
You guys are playing with our emotions! You know we want to see wolverine and Deadpool together in a movie and your playing on our emotions!!! 😭😭😭😭
now all you 2 need to do is your own cover of bosom buddies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD_stjC-qYA
Plot Twist: Costco wins.
If Ryan sucessful brings back Huge for even 1 wolverine movie, i will watch all of Ryan's future movies no matter how shitty they are.
Plot twist. They keep the money🤑🤑🤑
that guy on the left looks like robert angier
I want that kind of friend.
I thought they were gonna sing Forgiveness from Just Friends 😂
It’s just allergies... only allergies. Remember something Ryan without Wolverine there can be no Deadpool.
i donnoooo... is there a coffeee-ginshot option ? Like a best of both worlds ?  Might not taste good at all, but perhaps it's simply not the brew the world wants, but the brew the world needs...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13mUFEXnB54 Don't think I didn't remember the forgiveness song Monsieur Reynolds! You're amazing Sir! I thank thee for bringing a smile upon my face this morning!
And now an option for non-USA you Canadian and Australian guys...
It's almost a shame that these guys are not full blown gays 😁
Only these two could pull off an advert such as this! LOL!
Can you imaaaaagine
like the great  bully mugaire sayed  "you want forgivenes get relgoin"
HAHAHAHA CRANBERRY SAUCE OF HUMAN BEINGS
if this is the future of advertisements, i'm ready to watch an hour long ad
So now that we have them both on set at the same time....can we please start shooting DeadPool/Wolverine?
I still don't understand this rivalry, but I love it.
It’s a damn shame these two never did a movie together. Wolverine & Deadpool.
If this were Yu Gi Oh  Hugh: I play my under valued poor farmers card in attack mode! It's over Ryan!  Ryan: I believe in the heart of the Gin!   I PLAY BLUE EYED SICK CHILDREN AND ATTACK!  Hugh: No its not possible!
Ryan is indeed the canned cranberry sauce of humans.... Because canned cranberry sauce iS THE BEST!  😍
My fellow thespians,  one a fellow Canadian. I would love it if you both make a video for me when I hit 49 next month.
It’s not even thanksgiving tho. What’s with the whole Christmas thing.
Forgiveness...... is more than saying sorry......sorry haha!
jake gyllenhaal is feeling left out
That really doesn't seem fair.. on the one side the charity is "impoverished (luxury item, not necessity) business people" and the other is "dying children"
I love this series
Don't shop at Sam's Club. It is owned by Walmart. Don't buy into their bullshit of trying to "help" people. They have done and continue to do a lot of damage. Shame on these hack celebrities for endorsing such a company.
When are these two going to do a movie together?
Coffee VS Kids  This is a dirty fight.
MAKE A MOVIE TOGETHER ALREADY DAMMIT!!!
I love this love/pretend hate relationship. The world needs more pretend hate and less real hate.
wait a minute - if not both of you win that you guys will not donate ? Guess its a lose lose situation to choose between A or B if both need help
I can't choose LOL  I love them both!
With the feud sponsored by Sam's Club, the next logical step is pay-per-view.       Their in-ring debut is coming.
Canada vs Australia, my vote goes to Canada (and this is not a biased opinion because this is his channel or the fact that I am from Canada, it's mainly because Australia has so many things that can kill me) #TeamCanada #MapleSyrup
Christmas came early this year.
With such enemies you don’t need friends
Sorry but Ryan wins this one, coffee is good and all, but Human life comes first.
So they are  talking the 'keep you're enemy closer' to whole new level I guess😂
How did Hugh's chair make him look tall?
Both of you are evil!
Just kiss already
How do you even understand each other talking with your dialects? Crocodile Dundee vs Dudley De Right
Hugh Jackman is Australian😐
awwwwwww its so wholesomeeeee
Don't you just love this duo?
Ryan lost that one
It would be could having hugh Jackman return as wolverine to kick Deadpool's ass
If all ads were like every single Ryan Reynold's videos the world would be a better place.
just hurry up and stab each other 😏
Just in case anyone is wondering the votes on 13 Nov are...  Team Hugh - 5,698 Team Ryan - 6,992  Go team Ryan!
searching #jovianstar lands me here
Hey! If you guys are lucky.. maybe Trump will donate one of his portraits? From Charity to Charity...
Sick kids better then coffee but Hugh better then Ryan hard choice
"Also hated ones..." 😅
Forgiveness, it's more then saying sorry. To forgive is divine.............
I almost thought Anna Faris would show up singing the Song "Forgiveness" from their Movie Just Friends...
I'm torn between my love of ryan reynolds and coffee
Like mistletoe, Hugh just makes things awkward...hmmm. Definitely a bitter undertone there... Was Ryan rejected under the mistletoe once too often? 🥂
Deadpool or wolverine hard choice
WHY DO I HAVE TO PICK! YOU'RE BOTH AWESOME AND SO ARE YOUR CHARITIES!
Fish Dio has appeared
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE KIND OF TANGO AND CASH ACTION MOVIE WITH THESE GUYS! THAT COULD BE A REALLY GREAT AND FUNNY MOVIE. JUST SEE THE ENERGY BETWEEN THEM.  SO GUYS. WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVIE? :D
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hugh must be PhD holders in marketing.🔥
Lolz, love these 2 !
I’m super glad Ryan and Hugh became really good friends after doing one fairly shitty movie together 😄
"Omg I love you, girl so beautiful" - female friendship last a month "You suck" -  male friendship lasts forever.
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry.
No Ryan, we can't forgive the abomination that was The Green Lantern.
Hope their feud will never end
Frenemies
Oh man...Sam's Club...feels like you're selling out guys. Please don't let that be the case.
Wolverine vs deadpool
Regardless of politics, these two dudes never fail to make my day🤣🤣
Oh god, Just kiss and makeup already!!!!!!
Everytime I hear Ryan say forgiveness.. I hear "forgiveness.. is more then saying sorry.." Just Friends LOLL
hahaha im more of coffee guy hhaha
Hope to see this 2 Guys one time in a movie!
I'm Canadian but I'm siding with Hugh so ha
Both. Both is good
And consumerism guys!  Dont forget about mindless consumerism...
I thought if we sided with Ryan that he would send gin out to the needy of the world.
Lets go logan
Dear Ryan Reynolds... I LIKE canned cranberry sauce, but I don't like mistletoe or huge jackass. heck, I bought a bottle of Aviation Gin while you still owned the company, not just while you are the spokesperson for it... and I don't even like gin.
I want them to have a snowball fight.
Sick Kids saved my life on multiple occasions. Great choice Ryan!
Can we please get Hugh Jackman to cosplay in the actual Wolverine suit?
"Forgiveness it’s more than saying sorry”
No matter who you vote for, Sam's Club wins.
After 9 years, where is Real Steel 2?
Matt and Jimmy  Ryan and Hugh  The best feuds ever 👏👏
0:51 you don't help Tripy R...you don't help
thanksgiving is almost here
How do we know you are sitting in the room at the same time?🤔
they have to do wolverine deadpool now.
BEst insult ever "canned Cranberry sauce of human beings"
Why can't we just get an official Wolverine/Deadpool movie 😩
Cocaine. mmhhhhhhh
What the fuck is a Sam's club?
Wolverine... but Deadpool. Australia... but Canada.  I say screw both of you for putting us in this position. No doubt in 150 years wars will be fought over this.
I am Ryan side
Yeah, I don’t have membership there, so I have little say what happens in this contest!
神社が始まるかと思ったゾ
Why "Sick" Kids?  What a shitty, negative sounding name for a charity.  It's like if someone started up a foundation to help sexually exploited women with drug addictions and called it Crack Hoes.
No can DO... I side with Costco's.
Cranberry sauce is good!
I will be Deadpool 3
Or you can side with me that the NYPD is a criminal terrorist organization working with the Chinese communist party and watch My latest music video Only a minute and a half long
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I freakin' love you guys!? :) XX  (I mean hate you guys, whatever, you'd know what I mean if it was ever yous who read this)
Glad to see both here for a good cause.   Now that being said you both can get together for a bunch of videos give us Deadpool/Wolverine!!!!
as if rich folk have better things to do!
Mmm hate and love are the same emotion. As long as they're not indifferent.
wolverine and deadpool at it again
I have a better idea Ryan and Hugh, APPEAR AS WOLVERINE IN DEADPOOL HUGH JACKMAN. You all know we want to see you bear your claws again, and be along side the merc with the mouth, so come on mate.  To quote Shia LaBeouf, "Just Do It!"
I love you two. This rivalry is just golden
So, looks like the holidays(according to my immediate family)are now about hate, blame and grudges. Well I'm going to continue to make it about Jesus, love, hope and charity, so I'll be completely alone this year, but hey,my dad's still alive and that's all I need. And giving to this great charity, even though there's no Sams Club around here. LOVE YOU RYAN AND HUGH !
Why in hell would I shop at Sam's Club? The Waltons have enough money.
Huh?
I swear they are this universe's version of Deadpool and Wolverine
Wait.... An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's Club? Australia and Canada don't have Sam's Club. Love the fact that Ryan is pushing people to donate to a Canadian Charity. =D
I love you guys. Your brawl is what makes the world a better place.
Even if we didn't got the Wolverine vs deadpool fight. At least we got this.
there's no link you dufus
Forgiveness, it’s more than saying sorry.... “Just Friends” anyone?
😉😉😉😉😉😉
No
....I like canned cranberry sauce
Did anyone else get this song immediately stuck in their head from the video title: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13mUFEXnB54 ? 😂
What happens if we dont like either of them...
Seeing as how I kind of like canned cranberry sauce (sliced, at that), I'm going to have to side with Ryan.
I want a movie with you both guys !!! or maybe Hugh could join the MCU ???:D
even youtube knew this wasnt about forgiveness https://puu.sh/GMVfI/e03438f7b7.png
An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's Club...and had gay sex together.
Much love Ryan love every film your in. My favorite is the Pokemon Detective I think it's called as well as Deadpool & R.I.P.D Your so funny and I would choose you. ha little reference there or is it   It is
I have a question, Do you guys actually hate each other.
First
no need to side, get both
When they say keep your enemies closer  hahah
I like Costco.
With friends like  this, who needs enemas!!
Really need a Deadpool / Wolverine movie, these two guys have chemistry
Ah the Walton family stores, where full time employees make so little, they qualify for federal assistance...
Ryan knows the forgiveness song   https://youtu.be/13mUFEXnB54
Anyone else still do a double-take when they hear Hugh's natural Australian accent?
I’ll just have to pretend this is the Wolverine/Deadpool movie we all want. A really short, one minute and 17 second Wolverine/Deadpool movie...
Ahhhhh I can’t decide!!! 😭
God, I hope that Dr. Strange 2 Multiverse with Deadpool and Wolverine cameo is true, because we need to see Hugh and Ryan on screen in character together.
that´s THE QUOTE for every joke i´ll tell from now one....
❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋
Okay I'm okay with this commercials lmao
Get da bag
Every ad created by ryan I was not regret by watching it.
i love canned cranberry sauce.  you take back that insult!
Both beautiful humans.
Ah yes this is the definition of FRIENDSHIP!!!!
Sam's Club? Dude that was so 10 years ago
Sam’s Club is no dummy... 🤩
They can keep trying but they have many years to go if they plan on catching up to Kimmel and Damon.
Whose the older brother here
Ryan Reynolds, Sr. : Where can I find Ryan Reynolds?  Wasted Guy : In the Guinness Book of World-f**king-Records, man... under "Raddest F**king Dude Alive"!
these two really just need to sleep together (again) and get it over with
Ahh i love those two :D  Well done btw
Right Arm, Ryan!  'J' says that forgiveness remains the fastest path to Home.  See ACIM - Original Edition.
He was perfect for the role of Deadpool, everything he does has a little of Deadpool in it and he is always trying to help sick children he is a all around good person
Is one of you suppposed to be Trump in this?
Forgive, live and let die.
Coffee wins
Please do a movie together where both of you are competing in everything from getting a promotion to getting the girl it would be a hilarious romantic comedy where both fall flat on their faces
They weren't in the same room
I love these!
I want these two in ERB
Damn I want to shop at sams club now just to play into this.  This is amazing marketing!
I just saw the trailer Freeguy.  The movie seems to be one of those stupid "one person inspires everyone to believe"  stories.  If you want the movie to succeed, then edit out all the sappy crap. Unless, you found a way to create a new Santa Claus type figure which i doubt is the case.  I highly doubt this Freeguy character will rise to the ranks of Santa, an archetype that does indeed "inspire everyone to believe"
If the both of these guys were to make a new Deadpool/Wolverine movie I would forgive them..
IS MORE THAN SAYING SORRY!!!
A time to be joyful and a time to feud
i can tell you who my favorite child is but I how am I supposed to pick between you two lovable bastards 2020 just got real bad
Coffee vs sick kids  Hmm... Definitely a hard choice. But I choose coffee.
Canned cranberry sauce is pretty good though..
Marketing their friendship is the best shill I have ever seen. Damn I wish I was that good.
The canned cranberry sauce of human beings. 😂😂😂
Yt search: "Quantum Policing"
So they gey paid to use their names to promote Sams club a multi bilion dollar company asking for charity something is off here
What  nothing for Costco shoppers? Well you both lose then.
The real winners are us for getting to enjoy this rivalry for all these years.
Wolverine and Deadpool doing great things, thanks for inspiring
Thanks for the levity during these stressful times. You guys are the best!
Ryan is just naturally Deadpool.
Aww that's cute! Like two assholes on a first holiday date. ;D
i just threw away my sams club card ....fuck them profit elsewhere, i wont spend a dime with you to give these two a charity tax break
Love this! Thank you for raising awareness for these amazing foundations.
They need to just bone and get it over worth. Id watch that. No homo tho
I'm aussie and I hate alcahol but I am siding with renolds
deadpool vs wolverine
It's a Sam's commercial.
ryan looked at hugh when saying "loved ones" and away when saying "hated ones" so, there it is. body language
So as a straight male, can we all agree ryan reynolds is sexy af?
“Ask the former generation and find out what their ancestors learned,  for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.  Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?  Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?  While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.  Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.  What they trust in is fragile ; what they rely on is a spider’s web.  They lean on the web, but it gives way; they cling to it, but it does not hold.  They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;  it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.  But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’  Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.  “Surely God does not reject one who is blameless or strengthen the hands of evildoers.  He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.  Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more.” Job 8:8‭-‬22 NIV https://bible.com/bible/111/job.8.8-22.NIV
Deadpool and wolverine crossover now
I will side with both of you terrible gentleman.  Because it's only fair to spread the love/hate around.
Then you realize that like in so many animes/comics, mortal enemies make the best friends. Without each other, what is the point?
I would pay good money to hear these two plotting these stunts together.  They are obviously in cahoots & two of the biggest characters in movies.  Pretty sure a lot of funny ideas get floated before they settle on what's next.
With enemies like these two, you really don't need friends.  LMAO  I love these guys.
This is fun, I feel like the more they fight the more they love each other.
They look like a pretty great cast for wolverine and deadpool imo
Deadpool is Ryan Reynolds! no doubt, rest assured.
....is more than saying sorry :3
RYAN GANG
This is the most wholesome friendship in the world
I love you both.  Like brothers, you are the best sort of chums that have brighten my smile each time I have seen you.  Keep up the great work both.
I'm just waiting for their sex tape to "leak."
They get along better than most friends probably lol
I love everything I just watched
Love those two lol
If Deadpool can't have Wolverine, I am sure glad Ryan can have Hugh. MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!
I like canned cranberry sauce
These are the only ads I fine with watching.
Chris Pine!
Their reactions are so genuine, I love the idea of them just sitting down and improving about their "feud".
Ok
HAhahahaha ffs you to :D
But I LIKE canned cranberry sauce!
After watching this, my personality has fractured into two. Depending on which one is dominant at the time, I guess I'll be voting for both of these fine gentlemen.
I ship you guys.  I ship you Hard!
you 2 are weirdly funny...
😹😹😹
Asking me to decide between Hugh Jackman or Ryan Reynolds is like asking me to choose between Nutella or the off brand Nutella. Both are enjoyable and bring me joy. But one is more expensive than the other.
Grace is never once
Idk why tf this is trending like hashtag 27 lol

Come on Ryan. 🎶 Forgiveness. It’s more than saying sorry.  To forgive is divine, so let’s have a cup of wine and have makeup sex til the end of time time time time time 🎶   And you damn right I did that from memory!!
Ugh, Walmart company. NOPE
Forgiveness, can you imagine? Hugh and Ryan: NOPE!
We swapped one for the other. In my circle of Canadian high school friends we evened things out. John moved to Australia shortly after high school, married a local girl and established himself, including quickly picking up an Aussie accent. A few years later, a girl from our high school met and married an Australian and they've remained in Canada. He's retained his Aussie accent. Fair trade.
Team hugh! lets gooooo ^_^ haha
they’re best friends
I’ll never forgive Deadpool being massacred no matter how good Ryan’s movie was lol
HAHAHAHA!!! These guys, I just cannot get enough of their banter. Love this.
Why isnt there a Deadpool/Wolerine movie yet of these guys going back and forth  ?
Waiting for these two to do a remake of this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH4DnrqvZJ8
Wanna save yourself some money on Christmas ?  Protip: talk politics during Thanksgiving.
Dear Ryan and Hugh, I write this because I am hearing buzzing of Disney potentially casting a new actor as Wolverine. While I'm sure that whomever they cast will do a marvelous job, I'll admit that I would be truly dismayed to not see a portrayal of both of your resplendent performances in your iconic roles as Deadpool and Wolverine. The chemistry you share as accomplished thespians and virtuous gentlemen would truly translate to a cinematic experience of momentous proportion and everlasting significance. If I may be so bold as to propose perhaps a new film titled Deadpool X Not Wovlerine or perhaps Deadpool feat. Canadian Claw Hands or perhaps Deadpool: an officer and a Jackman. I truly believe this could be a truly mythical adventure, but alas I am but a simple commoner and perhaps I should not think things above my station.  I thank you for you time to allow me to wax lyrical. Graciously yours, Everybody
Oh man!!! Can’t I just choose you both!?!
But cranberry sauce is the best part of the meal...
Is not the" Hollydays" is Christmas.
Advertising is getting weird.
Stop girls, you both pretty
In the feud between Hugh and Ryan; who is the winner?    We, the viewers. Thank you Hugh and Ryan.
sam's club? walmart? how disgusting. thumbs down for that.
I am ready to forgive my enemies. As a token of my forgiveness I bring flowers on their graves. Once a year.
I just love how these guys take advantage of that "funny dispute" they have with each other to actually  promote some decent acts of kindness. Keep it up guys, you're inspiring!
I am expecting an aviation gin thingy
Brilliant!!
Lol that was a strong coffee and sick child association
This is Brillian!!!
Ryan Reynolds love’s hughJackman
Hey y’all go pick up some Rocket stock today wayyyy undervalued and housing platform for the future
I hope do a movie
This is the most brilliant marketing strategy in the world. I love it
Please.... Stop, u guys r tearin me apart! (tommy spidey train scene flashback!)
They’re both dope lmao
The people are trying to pick a winner. Hollyweird seems to have a problem with that.
You know what would of been awesome Anna faris singing the forgiveness song during this clip 😂🤣
When you confront your passive aggression...with more passive aggression.👍
Random people who like this will become millionaire someday
Dying kids vs. coffee - hmmm let’s see, which to chose, which to chose....
This feud helps both projects. I mean why cant we have more feuds like them?
Obviously Ryan has got to be the winner of this.
"Hugh plz forgive me for exposing the monster you truly are"  well he is wolverine so....
Whoever is reading this: You skin isn't paper so don't cut it Your body isn't a book so don't judge it  Your heart isn't a door so don't lock it Your life isn't a movie so don't end it  Be you....stay safe   (Btw small youtuber looking for your support)  I didn't create this quote  Just wanna spread positivity Stay safe my friends
Can’t I just do both?
For food lovers https://youtu.be/LdulvCHjsdc
“Loved ones... also hated ones” My family leans towards the latter 😆
its so wierd looking at Ryan looks so much like my brother
You're asking me to choose?? I'm not sure I can forgive either of you for that ... ;)
Oh god I’m team Ryan but I’m also team COFFEE 😭
Only the smart ones realised this is cgi and they didn't make the shots together...
Wolverine and Deadpool finally getting along, for now
I know this is funny and all but...How much money do these guys need?  I think it is a hard Pass!
Hugh's arms looks so long. Wth
Mhmm
That was funny.
So you gonna make wolverine pool or what?
Amazing project! I'd love to help by donating, I highly encourage this.
I think they have romantic relationship
Excuse me...where is the enemy..? 🤓
Love these 2 so much  ❤️
Love these guys
Reason Ryan will win, number 3000 https://youtu.be/dV3bnx-47Qo?t=2592
Perhaps I’m not the target demographic, but after 4 years of this language, I’m ready for something different.
I think these two should just get a hotel room & make things right. Haha!!! You know deep down, there're best of friends.
Two millionaires talking bs to deceived nation and getting paid
This is genius
So we have to decide between supporting poor farmers or helping sick kids...what kind of twisted game is this?  No supporting both options?
You have no chance Hugh. Ryan got the sick kids foundation man.  No one is going to choose better job security for coffee farmers over kids with cancer.
*sees title*  me: CAN YOU IMAAAAAGINE
I wish I could forgive people for the inconveniences they cause in my life...only time tells the truth about what I experienced.. hopefully no one else has to suffer due to other people's hatred and jealousy
There are life sized cardboard cutouts of these guys in my Sam's club.
Forgiveness, it's more than saying sorry...
Just waiting for that deadpool 3 with hugh jackman
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)
it sucks that u can only vote if y'oure an american in Belgium we want to vote to!
I forgive both of you for doing this Christmas stuff before Thanksgiving.
Can we vote for CGI Colossus instead?
Forgiveness, it's more than saying sorry, to forgive is divine, so lets have a glass of wine and makeup sex, til the end of time time time time time
My new dream Eiffel Tower situation
Entonces yo soy lo que tú piensas. Eso seré
Pregunta cuánta gente a muerto por. Lo que dicen ha en o hablan pregúntale tú si es que puedes a YHWH.
Would you two kiss already? Sure make a lot of women (and some guys) happy.
Well that makes sense.  I love canned cranberry sauce.
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k things to come
All i can say is " AUSTRALIAAAAAA" YEAH MATE
So all this was a promotional campaign for Sam's Club. Here's a thought upper elite of the world. How about Ryan and Reynolds and Hue Jackman take their cumulative 10s of millions of dollars and help the less fortunate, which is almost everyone, all the freaking time. And why doesn't the Walmart Corportion take their 10s of BILLIONS made THIS YEAR donate. No commercial. No fucking games. Don't tell anyone. Don't market. Just. Do it.
The Hitmans Bromance... the super stylish elite bodyguard has to once again put aside his hatred of another experienced hitman, until their shared love of fast cars, travel, murder, gin, coffee and playing dress-up, actually brings them together, in an explosive way that makes them the target of every other hitman on the planet. A delightful mix of Brokeback Mountain & Mr & Mrs Smith but with more passion and less horse. Also staring Jake Gyllenhaal as the guy stuck in the middle, and Samuel L Jackson to gaurantee an R rating.
Forgiveness  Is more than saying SoRrY 🎶
Why cant the wolverine and deadpool just have a cage match?
They say true things.
Why there are people disliking this video??
They have Christmas in Canada and Australia?!
Why aren't these commercials on actual TV? Oh, wait, they would probably offend "someone".
All jokes aside but what did he do?
expensive walmart
I'm proud of these two for using their own businesses and fame to help make a positive difference in places
😂 😂 😂 Guys, you always are hilarious when you are together in one room 😆
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry
hahahahahaha oh stars lads such ass & sass at start, just tell us straight k? whens the wedding & are we all invited to come along? 😂 xxx
fEELS LIKE AN APRIL FOOLS PRANK VIDEO!!
Imma do both. Both's good right? I believe both's good
Although I am an Australian I choose Ryan's side. Sorry Jacko.
By all means, let's keep the Walton family income rolling in.
They actually came up with a new ad you can laugh at.
I like caned cranberries sauce..........
Cool, cool, coolcoolcool... so what's a Sam's Club? Some sort of sandwich I'm guessing...?
the distance between their seats xD
I love this!
1 got coffee and one got sick kids this ain't fair lol
❤️👍
I really respect and connect with this kind of friendship
The only ads on YouTube that we don't skip
Ryan you and hugh just need to do a Deadpool wolverine team up movie it would be epic for all us fans. Deadpool 3 with wolvies claws on the cover.
With such enemies, you don't need friends.
Can't we just agree that you're both god aweful...kidding - as always mad props for doing what you do and the way you make it entertaining and fun.
Thank you gentlemen. I hope you friendship lasts longer than the stars!
I love these commercials, but you know what would be great? A WOLVERINE/DEADPOOL MOVIE!!!! But thanks for doing good things & making us laugh too!
What kind of holidays are you talking about. Christmas? Sorry, European here...
Absolute travesty we didn't get Wolverine and Deadpool in the same movie
Ryan Reynolds 😉😂
The laughing man? Sweet jeebus that not-Ryan Reynolds man is collaborating with the biggest GITS terrorist hacker?
Hugh Jackman all the way!!!
A epic relationship
I really needed this today 😂 xx
Coffee or kids with cancer I wonder which one is more important🤔
Haha
Can you imagine Hugh (as Wolverine) and Ryan (as Deadpool) in the MCU just going at it....I can die happy :)
Do a grumpy middle aged guys movie together please.
Give us a Deadpool Logan movie already!!!
¿Por qué no los dos?

It's not over , they agreed on a truce for a while
Why noone is making a movie with this duo!😭

I miss DamonVKimmel feud....
Your both idiots GROWUP U DUMPASSES 🙄 love u guys 🤗
Lol
haha that's kinda funny
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is have faith in what Christ has done for us.  End Time's Checklist https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI  Satan's Technology https://youtu.be/4IyPCGKFa0k  (He also has Spanish versions.)
The war of the morons. Who is more immature? 🤔🤣😂
My gosh
I dont know who to piiiccckkkk 😩
Wolverine and deadpool crossover??
*Does anyone know whose side we should pick ?*
*Does anyone know whose side we should pick ?*
Not asof asif
*And thus the feud continuous.....*
*And thus the feud continuous.....*
Your name and my name is same Ryan Reynolds my name is ASOF KARIM RYAN
*And thus the feud continuous.....*
When are you going to get the _BRAWNDO_ sponsorship though?
You want forgiveness, get religion
Yes forgive.        Now FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
I thought they going to sing “Forgiveness is than saying sorry...”
I haven’t changed my clothes in a week
Kiss already
I just love these two!!! Bloody champions
I don't want to pick a side because you two are both awesome and I love all your movies (sorry to say this but I also liked green lantern) but if I was going to pick a side I would say hugh, because I grew up watching his movies.
but will customers forgive unliminted for poor service?
forgiveness is more than saying sorry 😂😂😂
They're so spaced out on those chairs I don't think they were even in the same room.... interesting
is this budget robert downey jr on the left
Forgiveness....is more than saying sorry.
Help me guys! I no longer know if their hate is a joke or they actually do hate each other and are just joking ABOUT it. Hahaha!   Love you both! Awesome commercial as always!
I am not looking for forgiveness            -steve
So I have to pick sick kids, or coffee farmers..... not going to say one sounds a lot more impactful than the other but....
What. The. Actually. Hell. I'm. Trying. Not . To. Die.
New unus annus
Forgiveness... Is more than saying sorry.
ONe funny boy and a huge jacked man tell you to shop at Sams club this Christmas.
Gonna have to side with Hugh, he’s just better.
Wolverine V Deadpool I smell a series lol. Great guys for two great causes  Well Done lads 👍
“Forgiveness - is more than saying sorry...” 🎼
No Excuses Motivation video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrN439O3MHY&feature=share
Canned cranberry sauce is the shit fyi. #teamreynolds
coffee farmers or dying disease ridden children🤔🤔?🤔?
What’s Sam’s club? I’m a Brit. Forgive me?
Does your wife like the adrenochrome
SAY NO TO FISH BOWLS!!!!!
Ryan def wins
People call me wolverine but Ryan’s too funny and has a good foundation, I’m going with Deadpool/Ryan
Wolverine and Deadpool
Ryan is dead pool in real life 😆
FOR MISHA:  With such friends,  you don't need enemas.
I got Wolverine over deadpool!  What about yall?
Holidays: An emotional brawl between friends, loved ones, and hated ones.
"like mistletoe hugh just makes things awkward"  aw their faces after they give each other these beautiful compliments! friendship goals
https://youtu.be/KUvOQlkLNhE
Forgiveness is more then saying sorry it’s more then compromising. I think you should have bono sing backup all bonoy you know
I'd have a cup of LM coffee with Ryan.
Good
LMAO the different ways they sit are so funny to me for some reason
Are we ever getting the Deadpool Wolverine movie?
You can't do that... You don't put such choices and ask people to pick
🤔Okay, okay wait. Serious thought here.. What if you're the kind of person that supports both?☝😁(which i think there's quite a bit of us)  then how are we going to figure out who won??.. I say Deadpool and Wolverine fight to the death!! Oooor until someone admits that the other is better and clearly the winner👊🏽👍🏼
This is next level. Neither one of them has reached their final form.
I'm picking Hugh because Reynolds is just not funny no matter how hard he tries
The fact that these guys played the roles they played and they're rivals in real life too is the greatest Christmas gift ever
I don't have a Sam's Club in my area. So how about this - I suggest that Ryan recreates the video Hugh recently made for R M Williams and then the public can decide on who wore it better - Hugh or Ryan. I mean, who doesn't want to see Ryan rubbing his *ss on a chair? :)
I say Ryan
If you want to be saved and have everlasting life, repent from your sins, believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and that He died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
So help sick kids or coffee growers... tough choice that.
*Jackman2021*
Shameful ad
Are they the same age?
Why does this feel like an Unus Annus video without the clock?
Their friendship level is somethign else
In another reality they are married with two kids
The only true evil is Walmart...
They are the modern jack lemon and Walter Matthau.
My Gosh I needed something to diffuse the tension and stress! Thanks Deadpool for making us laugh again! Oops, I mean, Ryan =)
You guys ain't foolin' me... I mean, yer actors... :-)
I want to see the blooper reels for these things so bad
Wolverine & Deadpool?
My favorite celebrity feud, hope it doesn't end. Only time I think everyone are rooting for a sore loser to keep it continuing.
Oh man these 2 should just make movies together
🔥🔥🔥💓👍🌞🎇🎇🌟🌟💥💥🤗🤗🎉🎉💝💝🎆🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
These two crack me up soooooo bad. I love this fake rivalry.  Good work guys!
But I like canned cranberry sauce...
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.   “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.   And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.   For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.   But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”                      John 3  :16
Who else’s YouTube crashed while trying to watch ???
Who is here before a million views?
Would love to watch the video but since youtube just nope everyone to watch anything ill just wait
I love that they’re clearly best friends but they pretend they they want to kill each other, it’s fucking friendship goals

How in the shit are you so good at making an ad-hater seek out your damn ads?
Exodus 15:2 🌟  The Lord is my strength and my song; he has given me victory. He is my God and I will praise him--my father's God and I will exalt him.   God bless and happy Veterans Day!✌🏼✝️
Sorry Hugh.... Picking Ryan... LOL
Repent, and You will be saved!.
.......... I have no idea whats going on Update: I have some idea of whats going on
Hugh Jackman’s legs come up higher than where he was sitting good lord
Love the Hugh-mour 🤣
This is fricken weird why would we have to pick a side?
What a bunch of tsundere
Why is everyone celebrating Christmas early? Is the world ending in December or something?
Ryan , did you do any takes without a boner ?
When the video ends and you are still reading the comments.... 😆
Best add on god
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry. Forgiveness, means accepting people's flaws. To forgive is devine, so let's have a glass of wine. And have make up sex, until the end of time (time, time, time) Forgiveness, does not mean compromising. Lets forgive and forget and solve this african bet. just like the Chesher cat, who says, "Rarw! you're running on a dime! (dime, dime, dime, dime) Foregiveness Foregiveness Foregiveness Foregiveness "Where are you?"
Can't wait to see what Asian girls will do to you both!! #yaoifanart
Insults upon insults hurled, which makes it funny. But since both gentlemen are friends, it is wonderful that they are raising awareness for their respective charities. God bless! Stay safe and healthy!
The best Frienemies.
You know Ryan’s Canadian when he makes a Christmas themed video in November.
I would like to see the Feats of Strength between you two for this Festivus season. But please, let's not do it on the top of a cooling tower this time.
It's not Christmas at all.
I think the children need coffee?
Do they not get older? I guess a good rivalry is quite healthy. Also, can I get them for Christmas?
Even tho my gf said she’d ride your face to shut you up, you’re quickly becoming my hero. Thank you, Ryan
What?? No forgiveness song?? I was expecting them to sing “forgiveness...is more than saying sorry...” Ryan ought to know that one!
That montage at the beginning 😂😂
When u have YouTube premium but still had to watch a 1:17 minute ad from sams club 💀
Forgive me for caring! CURE FOR COVID-19   DON’T INGEST IF ALLERGIC TO ANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS:) 2 large chunks lemon with rind and seeds (no fake lemon squirts), 2 chunks garlic with skin, 1 small chunk ginger with skin, 1 thick skin of large onion (preferably shallot or cooking), 1 fist full of parsley, 3 tablespoons cinnamon and 3 tablespoons honey
Do I choose the good-looking one or the hilarious one? Tough choice!
Man oh man. Just Hugh of the two I’m I gonna side with? Hugh guessed it: neither
_Can you imagine?~_
Looks like wolverine be Deadpool will be a thing in the mcu... testing the waters right now
I love when Wolverine and Deadpool get passive aggressive with each other. The sexual tension is at an all time high.

Oh dear, lol. Boys really you're both pretty. 😄
I like the bro-mance.  Don't let Huge cut off your Ryan.
Deadpool v Wolverine IRL
ONTARIO/CDA IS NOT ON THE LIST OF STATES THEREBY ELIMINATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ONTARIANS ( AND I ASSUME OTHER CANDIANS ) TO VOTE.  NOT NICE  !!!!!!!!   SORRY RYAN YOU LOSE OUT ON ROUGHLY 38 MILLION VOTES...  IN KEEPING WITH THE TIMES I DECLARE THIS CONTEST IS RIGGED. SINCE IT IS POSTED WORLWIDE I THINK IT SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL OF RYANS SUPPORTERS.  Merry Christmas you two.... I eagerly wait for the truce to end.
Hugh really is NOTHING like Logan. He's warm, relaxed and happy.
https://youtu.be/V-CpzdfvfjM
Oh, C'mon, cut the crap and just kiss ... XD
This is the most wholesome way to do a dickish thing to effect a beautiful result.  You guys truly have the most amazing mutually-sustained hateboner in the world.
Marvel fans: is he coming back Me: shit he better
I really like this video. Also I watched Deadpool for the first time.  It so good.
Deadpool and wolverine COME ON
Please just one film guys

Why does this Feud look like it’s leading to DeadPool and Wolverine in the MCU?!!!
With such enemies you dont need friends
Hmm coffee or children...     c o f f e e      ;-;
This is the “Edward or Jacob” of  mediocre, web-based Walmart commercials.   FINALLY.
Canned cranberry sauce of human beings? Is that supposed to be an insult? Canned cranberry sauce is delicious....I’d eat it out of the can with a spoon 🤷🏻‍♀️
OHH...HI MARK
This is as close as a Deadpool Vs. Wolverine movie as we are going to get.
Well I could support neither. Earth is overwhelming overpopulated
Two secretly gay men
Dude make real steel 2
why couldn't there be a proper dead pool vs wolviren movie
Oop
Oh my god I love this it’s so funny
Sell out and FULL commercial, Ry Guy!
"Ryan, is the canned cranberry sauce of human beings"-Wolverine  0:37  Deadpool vs. Wolverine I love it!
Why do I feel like they’re teasing a Deadpool Wolverine movie?
Guys I honestly can't decide please stop this is worse then edward and jacob
Matthew 4:17 - Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
guys I’m hungry. Imma go make a sandwich. brb
This is the closest we will get to a Wolverine vs Deadpool movie. 😂
What if you combined Ryan’s gin and Hugh’s coffee into one drink aye
Forgiveness.. is more than saying sorry
Are we getting a movie with these two yet?  Come one!
Hugh and Ryan’s rivalry continues  ...so we getting Wolverine in Deadpool 3 or what?
Fuckin love you guys, this running meme is the best
They have the most chaotic friendship ever and I love it
Gut reaction: I'm #TeamRyan BUT omg Hugh I love you please don't cry I do I do I do
You two just need to get a room!
I won't forgive you if you don't make Deadpool 3 😜😂
I forget Ryan Reynolds is Canadian, so, umm.... shouldn't he be nicer? Is he defective, or like a shiny Canadian?
We NEED a Deadpool and wolverine movie
Hugh Jackman should teach Ryan cricket
Wait... So Hugh Jackman isn't really Canadian?
Both legend
Sams club? Keeping the minimum wage low. Go back to your Hollywood Heaven made of plastic.
They really need to do a disfunctional buddy cop movie.
I’ll join both the clubs.
Im with Ryan
I’m going with Ryan Reynolds because he’s helping children!❤️
😂
I'd totally be on board if the Waltons weren't involved
I’ll sign with both I’m not choosing sides
Hugh Jackman looks so.. nice.
Idk why but I love when certain celebrities from movies or tv shows are actually friends in real life
I would still pay INSANE money to see a DeadpoolxWolverine movie.....just putting that out there for the millionth time.
You are my favorite actor deadpool
You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,” declares the Lord! Use your ❤ to find God we all have one for a reason...  When something happens you don't have to apologize to me for thinking I'm crazy.  I forgive you 💯 just do your part & spread the messege...trust me on this ok guys...TRY & DON'T GIVE UP!!! Download The Holy Bible 🙏
Hi
They should undone this dressed as Deadpool and wolverine. Lol . I neeeeeed that movie lol
Forgiveness...is more than saying sorry.
Nah... just do a pay per view fight (maybe to the death gladiator style) then donate all of that money to a charity... or would be far more entertaining. Also... #Costco4Life #SamsMakesMeSadInside
This war is better than the story of the new assassins creed games
This two have the relationship like Deadpool and Wolverine..
I vote against...both of you.
MERRY CHRISTMAS! ❄️⛄️🎄🎁🎅🏻🍪
It’s genius! Yeah you’re given an obvious option but all of the sudden the option to just say nah isn’t even on your mind, generally they will get more donations this way. I’m sure they have a deal to even split regardless or some shit
LOL "The canned cranberry sauce of human beings"
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ:*
These two are hilarious
Better feud than Kimmel and Damon.
i choice wolverine
Ryan, you totally were a suck up with playing the sick children's card. And then Hugh is saying to pick him cause of COFFEE!?! Only people really obsessed with coffee would pick Hugh. Poor, poor Hugh...and Laughing Man...
America needs to see Deadpool vs. Wolverine!
Sorry guys.  I like you both, but Sam's is part of Walmart and I can't support the Walton family.  "An Analysis of Walmart and Walton Family Political Spending" is worth a read.
🎶Forgivnesss.... Is more than saying sorry🎶
Why did I know Ryan was gonna donate to sick kids foundation
Come to my channel and show you.
Does anyone else think Top Gear’s Richard Hammond and Hugh Jackson look alike?
Let's do both
DEAD POOL AND THE WOLVERINE >:]
Was a link in the description too much to ask? Apparently so. Which is why Hugh gets my vote. Because the man who played a computer hacker against John Travolta, the man who taught robots to box after drawing on his experience sparring against mutant 'blobs', wouldn't make such a rookie mistake. Oh and - https://samsclub.promo.eprize.com/thefeud/
they've been stretching that deadpool vs wolverine movie hype for ages. what is marvel been thinking??
What's Sam's club
Gee, you almost have me ready to renew my expired Sam's club account. If I ever get to leave this house again, that is…
look at deadpool and wolverine changing the world 😭
The chemistry is hilarious!
You're not bad at this acting lark, but your wife is both beautiful and super talented! She was outstanding in "the shallows!" This is in my all time favourite top ten films! Stay safe. x
0:04 Like that one portayal of Deadpool that we don’t talk about
i begin to believe these two hate each other for real
Ryan Hugh can't you just be kind and loving like everybody else around the holiday season?LOL
Is it possible to be free of the me, which produces all this chaos outwardly and inwardly? Can thought end so thought has no future? That which ends then has a totally different beginning not the beginning of the me, ending and picking up later.

A scene from Deadpool 3?
For fuck's sake put these two in another film together already! 😆😜
All I want for Christmas is more Wolverine dailies featured in movies

You want forgiveness? Get religion
yes
4 or 5 moments! You are heroes guys! 3 or 4 to go. Use them wisely.
2 fun guys! But is it really fair? Support coffee growers or sick children......Hmm, doesn't seem even. Need more videos to help me decide! Yes PLEASE
You said forgiveness? FORGIVENESS IS DIVINE! https://youtu.be/euiOOXgkFdo
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorry To forgive is divine, so let's have a glass of wine and have make up sex until the end of, time time time time tiiiiimeeeee
When are we gonna get a movie with them starring opposite each other?
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry
I thought it was an ad, skipped forward. Then I realised it was Ryan Reynold's ad, so I restarted from the top.
Got me
I love these guys🖤. Yeah. Who wasn’t.!🖤🤷🏻‍♂️🙏🏻
Gitmo
Sooo... deadpool vs wolverine?  This is straight out the comic books
Wolverine Deadpool movie please
If you can't make a deadpool/wolverine movie together. Might aswell do these vids on youtube and just be deadpool and wolverine in these small clips or do multiple of them advertising or just random shit. Would love to see it
How i saw this video " Wolverine & Deapool " all together........
STOP. GOD IS REAL. JESUS IS REAL. VERY, VERY, VERY REAL. SEXUAL SINS ARE HIGH SINS. TURN AWAY NOW !  WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND IS TRUE.

PLEASEHEED THiS.
These two are going to be the death of me, I swear 😂😂
How to vote?
https://youtu.be/NWVtcdy2vu4    😲😲😲😲😗
That was hilarious 😭
A movie like grumpy old men or the odd couple with Hugh & Ryan please lol
People who like these actors don't really care about Sam's
Who is Deadpool and who is Ryan lmao can’t tell
Helping Coffee Farmers vs. Sick Children..... hmm real tough one here
I love that they use their hatred for good. Very generous of you both lol
💖💖
Of course they'd bury the hatchet. When a mouse beats you down....
Didn't Sam's Club go bankrupt in Canada?
I wish I had a Hugh Jackman in my life.
Dead pool wolverine ASAP!!!!!!!
I want both of them in the family Christmas dinner.... *few hours later* MAYHEM 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Upgrade your account to Plus to support Hugh Jackman. Sign up for the private-label credit card to support Ryan Reynolds. It's a good card!
ryan would love dr cox.
I vote for Huge Ackman. Sorry Ryan **mwooooo hah hah haaaaaaah**
its like both my dads going through a divorce and telling me to pick a side. CANT YOU SEE YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT?! IM JUST YOUR CHILD DAMMIT
His "hated ones" comment was just a typical tsundere denial. Those guys are in love and they know it.
I actually worked at Sam clubs and it sucked
I'll pick hugh reynolds.... Or ryan jackman..
Why not both?
Brilliant!
Auto Comment to Specific Accounts for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
And right after that, they went to have a beer together
To help farmers that lift the economy and help humanity every morning by giving them the coffee they need so they can feel energetic for the terrible day at work they will face or help sick children that will probably be sick for the rest of their lives and be burden for humanity..... Bad example's ? I guess so.
Again. Really. Again.
ROFL. 😂 Hillarious. This made my morning. And it happens to serve a greater purpose and important cause. Love them both! ❤️
Cop pulls me over for jogging over speed limit smh https://youtu.be/817n6l5mrkM
Keep your friends close and your... “closer” friends closer. Like, so close that he may need stitching over his mouth or so close that he may need a CGI green suit.
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO, TO GET A MOVIE WITH THESE TWO?!?!
Hugh please come back as wolverine
Lovely
Help sick Children or put money in Hugh's pocket. NICE TRY SATAN!
you can't go past Hugh's award winning smile or Ryan's cold... dead eyes

We could have more space to grow ?
They just stealing ur money !!!
once... JUST ONCE i need them to sincerely tell me they don'T actually hate each other to the core. i NEED to hear that.
Wolverine and Deadpool :D
Settle the feud with a 1v1 in black ops 2
Reading the title "Forgiveness" made "It's Quiet Uptown" start playing in my head.
Let's make it simple Ryan's wine vs Hugh's coffee
Honestly,I can't choose.Can't I pick both of them,for different reasons? Both causes are good.Much needed work and a better life on one hand,compassionate care for kids on the other.I mean,c'mon,Jackman actually made muttonchops look good.Reynolds? How can you not love the snark?
You’d think he’d link the website but okay
DUDE! I want my one minute & 17 seconds back right now!  You are NOT forgiven, Mr. Reynolds! I thought this video was a remake of the classic "Forgiveness":  https://youtu.be/13mUFEXnB54
Exactly! Let the people choose a winner.....TRUMP 2020✌️🇺🇸 Count all legal votes! 😋
Nah, Costco rocks.
Needs more snikt!
I'd create  videos with my enemies too if they're as cool as these two.
just found out that hugh jackman is an australian and i feel stupid
FORGET ELECTION CONSUME PRODUCT
It's not going to be the same seeing Deadpool with some other Wolverine.
Will you two just get married already? lol
omg.the holidays.motal eminies to the end.
You want forgiveness? Get religion.
Please make a Ryan and Hugh review fanart of you two and give people notice to submit some hilarious stuff. We'll see who gets drawn as a bottom ;)
You work fast, Ryan Reynolds. It was just yesterday I dropped a toot in the memory of my Sam's Club membership and today a benefit concert for the keeds. ilu sugar bear
Plis for the last movie i just want to watch is wolverine v deadpool
An Australian and a Canadian walk into sams club.... Well that video description sums up everything....
But canned cranberry sauce is the best...
One Australian and one Canadian advertising for something which is only available in USA! What is happening??
Plot twist: they actually do hate each other's guts but they have to make it look like a joke to keep their reputation
an Australian and a Canadian working together on a site which states you need a state to complete registration, not a province or whatever the fuck they have in the down under... also no link... so that was fun.   also I choose Robert Downey jr or Alexander Skarsgard. so now my opinion is null and void.
Just do it and get the movie over with already I can’t take anymore of this!!!
Please comeback Logan
?
Was this shot separately??
I didn't recognize Hugh Jackman 🤣
We clearly have a winner, Hugh jacked the man
Oh, I’m sorry... canned cranberry sauce is the best.  Canned cranberry sauce is the only kind that matters, and you were too tall to play Wolverine.  So there.
Wonder how much checks did SAMS CLUB have to write to get these onboard..
Why do you need to donate when they could? Both the shit actors and the corporations. I'm not trying to give my money for them to save tax dollars chill TF out wolverine and memepool I ain't buying into it
Ryan and Hugh, Jimmy and Matt....what the hell is happening?   Still, cant have enough of these enemies.
Hugh: “Support farmers around the community.” Ryan: “Support children who are fighting illnesses.”  Miguel and Tulio: “Both? Both. Both is good.
Well I could side with my fellow Aussie... but nah, I will side with someone of my maturity level
It's crazy they still look like their still in there 30's
I still don't know if they are friendly friends or real life Frenemies.
- My eyes: Reynolds and Jackman - My brain: Deadpool and Wolverine     Merry Christmas everyone🎄
But I love canned cranberry sauce.
Well, we know who’s gonna win...
For the love of God put Wolverine in Deadpool 3
A wise man once said  " Forgiveness is divine but never pay full price for late pizza. "
Dumb
Forgiveness is ok but don’t forget https://youtu.be/ZNUmeo-sCKM
Deadpool and Wolverine.. The rivalry has been going on for ages
Somehow in all videos, there are people who put a thumbs down. Always. I wish i don't encounter any person who puts a thumbs down in all the videos he/she sees.
💖💖💖
i hope this friendly rivalry never ends
still a better love story than Twilight
Directly donate to organizations. Big companies like to push for tax breaks around this time of year so they won’t have to pay any, come tax season. Do good for the organizations you support, and your economic situation (:
Yeet
Please guys, all we simple folks need is Deadpool 3 feat. Wolverine!!! 👏👏👏  Love y'all
Σταρ ελιφ
Wait, when did they start getting gray hair? I’m feeling old now...
Sucks when you have to be American to vote!!!
Gotta make a movies with these guys, even if not Deadpool, anything!
Both of you find a way to get wolverine into the Deadpool movie series you crazy handsome fucks
2 Mutants
gaud just make a movie together all ready!!!
You know ryan and Hugh BFF's are
475,362nd view
Forgiveness...is more than saying sorry
I thought Hugh was going to forgive Ryan for Green Lantern.
Xmas sweater time
Then they made out
The perfect  video title doesn't exis-
Why can't Joe Biden and Donald Trump be like that ever?
THE DESCRIPTION!!!
Ryan wants to save children’s lives while the other guy wants coffee
It's ok Ryan, I love all cranberry sauce.
There friendship is so uniqueA❤🥺❤🥺
Good Commercial
Deadpool or Wolverine tough call I pick Deadpool I love them both but I love Deadpool more sorry Hugh Jackman I side with Ryan Reynolds
canned cranberries are surprisingly better than even the ones grandma made.
I’m siding with Deadpool. Nuff said.
I love Christmas season ❤🎄🎅🏻
People are starting to learn Ryan is the best marketer 😂😂👏🏻
Ryan, please bring back Wolverine. One last time...
WOW is that wolverine vs deadpool teaser???
Forgiveness of sins
Hope you are all staying safe out there! Btw I'm a small YouTuber.
love the shitposting, keep em coming
The “canned cranberry sauce of human beings” had me dying 😂🤣😂
Wed to see you together again in a movie
I don't like being cynical, but advertisements like this are partly why I am.  Sam's Club shouldn't get feel-good points for using a charity (and celebrities) to boost name recognition and sales.
I would believe this except Hugh Jackman looks like he's having so much fun lol
ya ill go with ryan
Too far.
Don't ever stop the feud,  it's way too entertaining
nice to see they are practicing social distancing!
So when's Deadpool with Wolverine coming?.......
Forgiveness is letting these two go about their day even though they're too perfect for life xD
Hello Everyone, I’m a new singer and i just started my channel! I promise you won’t regret listening to my voice! Please give me a chance and just go watch a few of my videos! If you like them, give me a thumbs up and subscribe ❤️ Thank you! Hope we all succeed!
This is what alternative X Men universe where Wade and Logan becomes Xavier's school professor. Wade found the cure for the avocado face and Logan finally visit a therapist and join the aa meeting. Both secretly want to kill each other.
I'm just so sad that we'll never get to see the two on the big screen as Wolv and DP
Is Ryan gay
Random Fact:  If you look at how long the Earth has been here, we're living in the blink of an eye. So, whatever it is you want to do, you go out and do it. -Jamie Foxx  (good things do's of course 😉)  -Olastic Views channel ✨  Thanks for sharing! This has just inspired me to go do something I’ve been putting off! Will upload it on my channel soon - stay  tuned fam 🥰
*I almost forgot what the Holidays where about. Thanks guys!*
Canned Cranberry Sauce!
Great as always!
This is better than green lantern
Good green screen
Why haven't we gotten a movie with these two staring in it? I don't know what it will be about, but just these two doing their thing
With such enemies, you don't need friends.
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17  nkjv ❤️
This just cracks me up so much. It is also hard to choose Ryan side in promoting support for the kids or Hugh's side that brings heartwhelming feelings.
You have to make a movie together. Two superhero against each other
Unfortunately Sam's Club is a Walmart branch to compete with Costco, and I don't support Walmart.
they forgotten the link  https://samsclub.promo.eprize.com/thefeud?xid=hpg_shelf_5_1
Ryan Reynolds hitting bellow the belt going with the kids on this one
I will have to go out of state but I am doing it!
WHERES DA WOLVERINE DEADPOOL MOVIE MOTHAFUKKAS
No it’s not! The feud must continue!!! 😂😂
Managing to hold a grudge for charity is the most petty and generous thing I've heard in the last 25 years. Even a fabricated one. I love it
Also this was nice
No offense but, since when did November become the start of Christmas themed things?
*This will not end well.*
Ryan or Huge, I was urged for both
what the fuck is a sams club
After watching this, I'm off to google wolverine vs deadpool
I volunteer to bring you two together to hug it out. In the spirit of Canadian/Australian cooperation and understanding.
I like canned cranberry sauce.  Getting it to come of the can intact, preserving the grooves of the can....it's a freaking art. team Ryan.  I'm rooting for more sick kids. wait...
LOGAN ,  DEADPOOL   And Forgiveness 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 IMPOSSIBLE
I love it.  Something funny, and a spoof that actually provokes a smile.  Go get him Ryan.  Damn Australians.
A friendship comparable to Jack Benny and Fred Allen! Ok, let the searching begin.
These two are just incredible.
Lol. I got the mistletoe one. But . . . what does being "the canned cranberry of human beings" mean?
For all you people trying to quote "Just Friends", here's the goddamned clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13mUFEXnB54
this is charming, but F WalMart and F Sam's Club.
WHY IS EVERYTHING YOU POST A COMMERCIAL
Woo
How’d all this start?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
I just remembered that scene from "Just friends"  "Forgiveness is more than saying sorry,  to forgive is divine,  and to have a glass of wine,  and have make up sex  until the end of time time time tiiiiiimmmmmeeeeeee time. lmao
no one can replace them as the characters Deadpool and Wolverine 🔥🔥
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.
Ryan is already 602 votes ahead. I think this was over before this started
How could Ryan lose? Donate to help Coffee or Sick kids? Please for the love of God help the sick kids. How is this even a thing lol..
Oh stop it you two, you make me adore you more every time I see you together
"Forgiveness... is never saying sorry" - Samantha James
Can you do a dead pool Christmas video just a idea
Why actors teaching stuff? Camera whores
Okay I love Ryan Rynolads
No...  THIS is "Forgiveness": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13mUFEXnB54
let’s remind everyone who they are: one was naked. one runs a phone line company.
Hugh absolutely won this clip
Its like a real life wolverine and deadpool relationship
0:38 Sorry Hugh, it's not truely the holidays without cranberry sauce in the shape of a can. It's as God intended.
I like canned cranberry sauce.
Damn it. Choose??? Love both.  Age and Beauty, before Beauty I guess.
Ya know. Deadpool and Wolverine should just give the people what they really want... 2 Action packed hours of unadulterated violence, swear words and lover like treatment.
Please make a Action Comedy Movie, Together ❤️ that would be awesome
ROFLMAO  You Fellers Rock.
who's that guy on the left?
So donate to Coffee slaves or sick kids? Combine the two and you got yourself a deal :-)
Will kids happiness and wellbeing should be our priority so I'll choose Hugh , they can be happily ever after in HEAVEN
Ryan Reynolds' Videos: Advertisements that you love watching.

forgiveness only works when done...lol
Dammit. I can't decide. I guess I'll just donate to both.
sams club cashing in on the tax break
On one hand I can pick Hugh Jackman, on other hand I can pick gin...damn, tough choices
Can you imagine!
Ah family is great and hate. Perfect! Thanks for another great one.
Holidays: An emotional brawl between friends, loved ones, and hated ones.
WOLVERIIIIIIINE
You both are great movie stars forgive and forget all right
Everyone make my comment famous so Ryan can like the comment
too bad, now my donation is splitting up
Idk bout y’all, All I see is Wolverine and Deadpool talking.
I'm still here guys 👍👍💓💓
What if you combined Ryan's gin and Hugh's coffee into one drink
They should make a movie together sometime....
“ FORGIVENESS! IS LIKE NEVER SAYIN SORRY!”
Too soon. 😔
I'm surprised that the very last second of the commercial didn't feature Ryan saying "fuck you"
... but I like canned cranberry sauce.
These two need to just screw and get it over with.
https://youtu.be/WUoja4TvW-o PS5 update
OMG WHY IS THIS NOT TAYLOR SWIFT AND SALENA GOMEZ
Wait, why cant i support both?
IF YOU START READING MAKE SURE YOU FINISH THIS IS A SIGN FROM GOD FOR YOU!!: GUYS IM BEING DEAD SERIOUS JESUS PUT IT ON MY HEART TO WRITE THIS AND SAID IT WOULD SPEAK TO SOMEONE REALLY!! Please don’t think I’m playing cuz I would never lie on His name like that 💯  God says He sees you & notices you for your true beauty. He said that there are times where you’ve struggled to find peace & happiness but those times you looked haven’t been ignored by Him. He said that He sees and notices all the hurt you’ve been through & all the times you stayed up overthinking. He says He has been there with you everyday even if it didn’t feel like you feel Him. He said that He loves you for who you are & understands you more than you sometimes understand yourself. He wants you to know nothing you do can make Him love you any less. He says that He’s seen your hurt and how people have said words that hurt you more than they know. He says He has compassion for what you went through and He wants you to know you’re never too far from Him. He said He will lift your spirit up & refresh you & will show you where you need to go in life. He said that He sees your family & cares for them so much & that they will be protected by Him wherever they go. He says He has seen your tears and the tears that you held in & you didn’t see it but He was there with you crying next to you. He feels hurt every time you felt hurt. He says He sees you as His precious beloved, He calls you His beloved. He sees you for who you really are, and it’s hard for others to understand but He understands you completely. He wants to give you His love into your heart & fill you with peace like you’ve never felt before. He wants to be your friend, He wants a relationship with you. He’s asking you to invite Him into your life. He’s at the door right now and wants to give you his blessings and unconditional love and peace. He’s asking if your willing to invite Him into your life?   IF YOU WANT TO ACCEPT HIM INTO YOUR LIFE JUST SAY THIS PRAYER OUT LOUD, NOT JUST IN YOUR HEAD, JUST SAY IT IT TAKES 1 MIN BUT MAKES YOUR SOUL 100% GO TO HEAVEN AND GIVES GOD ACCESS TO WORK IN YOUR LIFE, DONT HISITATE!!! MEAN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, & BELIEVE HE HEARD YOU BECAUSE HE DID!! ITS THAT EASY IM BEING SO SERIOUS SAY THESE WORDS AND MEAN IT & YOULL GO TO HEAVEN!!!   "Heavenly Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. I now renounce any connection, attachments, and leverage I have given willingly or unwillingly to the devil. I acknowledge him as an enemy and accused against me and also against you and I will not support anything he plans on doing in my life. I declare his assignments in my life broken and destroyed in Jesus name. I declare that I trust you are much much more stronger than him and I declare that I as a new believer have been given power and authority over and against him in Jesus name. You are my defense and my stronghold, my heart will trust in you. In Jesus name, I declare that my thoughts, actions, and behaviors are free from the devils doing and I know and have faith you are fighting for me. Anytime I feel weird or off or feel something trying to attack my spirit, I will realize that is not you but from the devil and I will say out loud ‘In Jesus name, I am free and on fire for God, anything near or around me will feel the scorching fire of the Holy God and the fire will not leave them in Jesus name’! (Literally say you are pouring fire on the demons around you whenever you feel off or just mad at the demons for being evil lol but you HAVE to say in Jesus name you are doing this) Lord thank you for hearing me and I trust and believe your ears are always listening to my prayer and even if I don’t see it with my eyes, my life is not changed in Jesus name. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen."  HES FOREVER IN YOUR LIFE AFTER YOU SAID THAT PRAYER NOW EVEN IF YOU DONT FEEL HIM JUST KNOW HE IS WATCHING OVER YOU! NOW ITS YOUR TURN TO GROW YOUR FRIENDSHIP W HIM! YOURE ALREADY ON YT SEARCH UP HOW TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!! THATS HOW YOU START HEARING HIM AND SEEING HIM AS A FRIEND!! DONT BE MAD AT GOD FOR NOT TALKING TO YOU IF YOU NEVER GET TO KNOW HIM AND TALK TO HIM. THATS HOW YOU BUILD A FRIENDSHIP!!!!11111hhhggghhjtgg  WATCH THIS VIDEO HOW TO GET CLOSER TO GOD: https://youtu.be/ljsbz6ngkSw  Hhfvftd hats  htre hy
Dead or Alive your coming with me
I love this Aussie vs Canadian please don't stop its like the only 2 country left that can have a joke and take the piss.
I’m only voting for huge if he agrees to Deadpool 3 as wolverine !
Ryan is just mad he has to play the second most famous Canadian comic book character... while an australian plays Wolverine ;)
Brilliant campaign.
Imagine, picking a fight with someone 1inch taller and 8 years older and also pretty jacked up. You must have some balls.
No way I thought Logan died 😳
Is Ryan's charity, Sick Kids in Toronto? If so, I know where my vote is going.
lol me pick ryan
These two must make a comedy together 🙏😂🤣😅💯 Call it "FRENEMIES"🙏🙌
Forgiveness.... is more than saying sorry! 😂
A social distancing very Canadian and Aussie disagreement! I love it! But comparing Reynolds to canned cranberries was hilarious because we love canned cranberries!! Lol 😂
IT DOESNT WORK....YOU BOTH NEED TO SELL THE SAME ITEMS FOR A COMPARISON. I don't drink so of course I'll choose the coffee over the gin
I die for 5 minutes and everyone changes their name to the dumbest things ever. They went from James Howlett, and Wade Wilson to *huGh jAcKmaN, and rYan reNolDs* seriously guys... 😐
Not gonna lie.. Would have really looked forward to seeing a Deadpool and Logan interaction in the MCU.
Can we do both!?
Forgiveness is more than saying sorry. To forgive is divine, so let’s have a glass of wine, and have makeup sex, until the end of time, time, time, time, tiiiiimmmeeee....time.
the elf music is getting to me
A wise, and talented, woman once said, “Forgiveness... is more than saying sorry.” Words I live by...
Wolverine and Deadpool movie needs to happen.
Both. Both is good.
The only adds I watch are the Ryan Reynolds ones, oh okay except for the tear jerking Christmas store adds, but thats all I swear. :)
Bro how old is he. Iast seen a pic of him he looked like a old fart. Now hes like 30yrs younger again
Huh
Hilarious!
Wait... He's Australian.
I forgive the Democrats for scheming to mail-in thousands of fraudulent votes for Joe Biden. No, I don't. TRUMP 2020!!!
When I saw this in my thumbnail I thought Ryan was the next person targeted for being cancelled. Thank dog he's not. 👍
We need them together in a movie just bad mouthing each other
Gostaria muito de entender mas infelizmente não tem legendas em português 😢
I am assuming we can donate to both
I'd vote for Huge Jackman.     Ryan is funny on screen and annoying in person like Jim Carry.   I know you love him Ryan but I'm pretty sure he's not intrested in you.     Stop following him around like a lost puppie and move on.  Lol.
Forgiveness  Is more than saying sorry ForgIvenessss  Just Friends- staring Ryan Reynolds
Everyone is broke and unemployed why don't you two donate your own money which you will never notice  and let Americans keep there own hard earned money. How much have you two made off of marvel movies again? Gezzz
He says it like cranberry sauce is bad
With such enemy, you don't need friends
I watched some reporters/journalist interviewed Jackman about some deep stuff that most of us asking and searching for the answers! like is there a God ? Who are we ? Where did we come from and so on .. Jackman seems like a very open minded person and great human being . These two guys are great human beings that are more than just actors but really compassionate and kind people ..
This guy is a fucking genius. His uploads are almost exclusively advertisements, yet we still watch them. I wonder what his take is on these deals.
Ryan let’s see you and the PrimeMinister Justin Trudeau on the next video . Talk about the cold winter 🥶 in Winnipeg 🔜 Eh 🙂
Forgiving? Those two never forgive anyone 😂😂😂
Forgiveness.... is more than saying sorry
I shipped Ryan and Hugh and came out with 2020
Team Ryan
Me and my friends after an among us round be like:
No one:       Hugh Jackmon - YOU’RE FORGIVEN
You guys are right..... The Oreo ad was complete BS. Orange Cat BAD!
These two give Hollywood a good name.
Can we just have a special with them two?
What a brilliant way to push people to donate to people in need!
does anyone know what happened to jake gyllenhaal in this friendship?? 😭
How do you choose?  I mean, Ryan has that sardonic British humor & Hugh has that debonair British humor. Or wait-- the other way around? Or wait-- neither of them are British?  I choose Mr. Reynolds because I prefer canned cranberry sauce. That stuff with the weird lumps in it is gross. Gimme that smooth gelatin with the indents from the can, baby.
I choose Rick Moranis because you are both weak compared to him.
Forgiveness.... Is more than being sorry.....
But....what if you buy both?
Are we starting to get daily uploads?!?
Monetizing hatred for charity: for christmas.
Fvck, that brightened my day. LMAO
Mix 'em both and see what happens...
might want to link it in the description
But I like canned cranberry sauce.
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures    1 Corinthians 15 3
OR Sam's Club and it's parent company could make the donations
Forgiveness no, getting even yes
WOW, those CHAIRS... me want!
friendemies
Fa la la la la la la
Hugh can do no wrong he's wolverine
They're so damn awesome
❤❤❤❤❤❤
.....is more than saying sorry.   Like if you remember this
They're both so adorable
you can tell this to mr depp
I’m going to cut my balls if these gusy don’t make a Wolverine-Deadpool crossover movie.
When do we get to see Wolverine vs Deadpool?
Jeez! This better than Harry Potter sequels.
Canadian and Australian both have the same strange sense on humour g2li 😉😁🤣
Maybe they should just wrestle it out.. they need a reff.. I volunteer as tribute!!
Just went to sam's club today and got me a pizza pretzel
Forgiveness can you imagine~
A way, WAY better love story than Twilight.
So the 2 choice I have are a Charity for coffee growers + that wolverine guy, what was him name, Huge Jakman? whatever. *OR* a Charity for sick kids + *RYAN REYNOLDS!!* Wow this is a real tuff one, ok I am going to need a minute here.
We need jack man to come back as wolverine and get these two on screen together
Ryan we have the same birthday!! Also when did Deadpool get his skin better
I have a costco membership. sorry not sorry
Forgivenessss, is more than saying sorry
I don't want you.  You are a liar.
ummm it's 10th of november
From Jimmy&Matt to DJ&Kevin to Hugh&Ryan to Trump&Biden. @@
Wolverine Vs Deadpool !!!! Love
"An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's Club..."  Not without a paid membership, you don't...
Well. I know where I’m shopping.
Someone wise once said that forgiveness is more than saying sorry.
"Hyyye Jackman heee'a"
Let me get this straight, you want me to buy stuff from the owners of Walmart?  Why wouldn't I just donate directly to these organizations instead of supporting supporting an unethical company?  Pardon me while I cut out the middle finger man.
arrr, two gay men at christmas, enjoying each others company.
A part of me wishes they hated each other in real life.
did he get canceled
Thought this was gonna be a music video for  “Forgiveness” by Samantha James.
anybody else not even know what sams club is?
Forgive me; but can I have like..a thousand dollars? Times be hard for un-rich people.
Can y'all  make a prequel for Grumpy Old Men.   Pleeeeeease!!!
im sorry but Ryan has a better cause, seeing as how his character was afflicted with cancer in the first place its seems pretty fitting he should want to help kids with the same illness
Me: *Reads description*  My Brain: Wolverine and Deadpool walk into sam’s club...
Just when I think we have seen the cutest thing you two can do, more shenanigans arrive and we are all better for it.
I feel like there is a wolverine side bet  so I pick ryan just in case.
is there a reason why these 2 future mcu heroes are in the same commercial ?
Forgiveness... can you imagine?
I spent money on both!  Now if they would just bicker naked!
I'm shocked that Ryan or Hugh, are not talking about the Mr. Jonathan Hickman's X-Men... Hmm I wonder why... 😏😏😏
Hugh, when are you going to star in that Bill Bixby biopic? C'mon!
be kind
DEFINITELY AWKWARD!!!
I side with Hugh Jackman.
Forgiveness... is more than saying sorry Hit the like thumbs if you got that Ryan Reynolds reference
no
Sorry guys but I will be donating to both of you, though I have an idea. If Ryan wants to help sick kids and Hugh wants to help coffee farmers, then why not combine and help coffee farmers sick kids, in really poor countries where the coffee isn't fair trade but is drunk by millions around the world?
How much where y'all paid for this? it was a creative genius, and helps people!
You want forgiveness? Get religion.
when i saw the title all i thought about was Anna Faris’ song “Forgiveness” in the movie Just Friends 😂😂
An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's Club...its the start of a bad joke....the side swipes and underhanded vitriol is palpable. Cant you just be friends?? let the hate be put away.....think of the children damn you 😭   🤣Love both you guys, thanks for the memories you have given through your movies (yes, all of them), and the philanthropic endeavours. Cheers
Ryan and Jack would make great for Top gun’s program in the movie.
Dead pool. And wolverine got to forgive.
I will never forgive Hugh for portraying the monster P.T Barnum in a heroic way.
Oh. No. I LOVE canned cranberry sauce.  Sorry Hugh.
“Forgiveness... is more than saying sorry, ₛₒᵣᵣᵧ “
I heard that Harrison Ford & Ryan Gosling were doing the same thing through JC Penney until 5 minutes in when Harrison got sick of Gosling and punched him in the throat (killing him instantly).
I love when wolverine and Deadpool argue
This is awesome, also screw Sams Club.  Was Target not available?
Ryan: "You know they say the holidays are a time for forgiveness." Hugh: "And if we're being honest, the two of us have a lot to be sorry for."  Yeah, no.  You don't get a pass for X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  Sorry, not sorry.
Are you #TeamReynolds or #TeamJackman?
If they made a movie together it will be top box office hit
Brilliant.💯🤍
best video ever love the wolfman
Or you multimillionaires can give y’all’s money away and help those sick kids for real besides asking for money from us po folks but hey who am I
Who do I support, Deadpool or the man who refuses to be Wolverine because he hates humanity and murders orphan bunnies in his free time.
dude canned cranberry sauce is awesome, the superior cranberry sauce
OMG it's my two favorite X-Men Deadpool and wolverine
Merry Christmass.
We will forgive you both if you give us a movie have Wolverine and Deadpool playing together
I think the winner is all of us as we get to watch this bromance war.   Honestly, one of the best things in the world.
Can't WAIT for these two mortal enemies to take a holiday greetings card photo together with both of them wearing ugly Christmas sweaters!
Whoa-I don't know that it's true Ryan is like canned cranberry sauce, you mean that cheap stuff that people put out but know one touches then if anyone does eat it they are filled with instant regret....you know what, that checks out.
Forgiveness...  can you imaaaaaginnnne
That feeling when their animosity is still better than any friendship you've had.
Absolutely love it when my Movie Star Superheroes do stuff like this!! Donating!!
Ryan is way better than hugh
Why is Wolverine and Deadpool on my trending?
Ryan wins, no question! Three reasons: 1. He has alliteration in his name like a comic book character. 2. Hugh Jackman is Australian and he just said this holidays, we call it the silly season down under not the holidays! C. Ryan Reynolds is just a more likeable guy.
You’re both monsters for making us choose!!!
I want to pick both of them  What good sports
I'm not gay, but these two men made a porn, I'd watch the shit out it.
Voting only open to Americans?  What's the point of that????
I want to see more of Hugh's adorable Frenchie!!
I didn't read the comments, but I understand why the easy one is directed at Mr Jackson.
Wolverine and Deadpool talking about forgiveness.
Want forgiveness, get religion
https://youtu.be/GLzRotujxIw🥶
So it's either support coffee...or sick kids?  Kinda screwed yourself there Hugh.
lol "hated ones"
*Reparations.*
Ryan ILYSM you and Hugh are amazing❤
As always the holidays are about money. Giving money...and taking it. *evil laugh*
So they need to do a damb Laurel and Hardy buddy horror comedy movie already.
But can we do both...?
"Ryan is the canned cranberry sauce of human beings"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 - why do i find this so incredibly funny?
This is actually beautiful
Hmmm coffee farmers in central American or sick children...  Tough call.  RIP Logan
I love how they pick at each other. 😂
Who are you
enough with all this foreplay just put it in ... to the movie you know we want.  Jeees would you just take all are money already
They social distanced.  Good job
racǝd
So basically pick Deadpool or wolverine
One the best bromances ever.
https://youtu.be/pj2eQZ3NrCY
I thought this was gonna be some kind of ploy to forget about the fraud joe Biden committed to try and win the election that he has yet to win even though the media says he did
just two canadians
"Is more than saying sorry" 🎶 - Samantha James
Cool
I like these short videos i always watch them :)
Ryan Reynolds vs. Hugh Jackman in the 2024 Presidential Election
The kings of commercials. Now I need to visit Sam's club. Oh darn I currently live in South Korea. I guess I'll have to settle for costco.
I pick Ryan
Deadpools back baby!
Imagine if someone put jake gyllenhaal btwn them
I appreciate the charities, but working with the Walton's? I can see why you can't forgive each other. 😂
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" Jn 3:16
I don’t know what’s funnier: the “rivalry” between these two or the “rivalry” between Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon.
so sad to know hugh and ryan wont make a Wolverine/deadpool movie together..
Ryan definitely because Deadpool funnier than polverin
Its IRL deadpool and wolverine
God please never stop these jabs at one another. Please!
You guys are truly the best good man 👍
Forgiveness, its more then saying sorry.
I like canned cranberry sauce!
Canada and Australia keeps on producing strange creatures, which we sometimes highly admire.
I'll be honest, the "canned cranberry sauce of human beings" line might put it over the edge for me.
We need a Wolverine vs Deadpool movie. Like literally need.
🤣😂😂 love you two together! Also, I actually like to canned cranberries....of course I like anything to do with Ryan Reynolds. Come on.... Canada's thee most friendly country!
but can I choose both?
Every company that is smart enough to have you make a commercial for them, they don't know how lucky they are. The only thing I didn't like was when you tried to *promote the widespread use of Cancer beams* , Oh, I mean 5G.. I hope the money was good..
This went from a rivalry to a wholesome friendship giving each other Christmas compliments. This has been a rollercoaster, just like the year 2020. And to see it end like this is perfect
ok now where's jacksepticeye
Still the best frenemies ever. You both have the best hair.
https://youtu.be/GLzRotujxIw🥶🥶
I understand that Youtube has to have rabbit holes to keep people engaged. Conspiracy theories, vtubers, Twitch streamers with awkward clothing choices, I get all that. But why the hell is their a Ryan Reynolds / Hugh Jackman rabbit hole?
Coffee vs Kids
We just get it all. Batman vs superman Captain America vs iron man Hugh jackman vs Ryan Reynolds  It all sums up
If those two weren't Wolverine and Deadpool, people should LOVE them. But turns out THEY ARE. So people should WORSHIP them. Those guys are beyond awesome.
(Matthew 5:43,44) "You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you,"  Jesus said that, and he had real mutant powers like walking on water, controlling the weather, feeding thousands with little, and even bringing people back to life. ❤
Whomever wins the battle. The loser must co-star in the Winners greatest film franchise. So sorry Ryan! I love Hugh. He has a better “body” of work on Broadway and Theater.  So Hugh. You must lose and come back as Wolverine in a Deadpool movie.  It can’t be a cameo. We need to see “The Wolverine” style character.  We know you’ll not disappoint the fans.  After all, Deadpool is the Weak and Flabby one. Wolverine claws were always more erect and stronger than Wade limp wang.  Wade. Shhhh. You know we love you too!
I love these two together. I laugh every time. Thanks guys!
Nope...sams club is horrible, should have gone with Costco
Ryan, easily
Hugh and fucking Ryan, love this duo
You guys are amazing 😀😀😀
this is awesome
why is it all the clebs only seem to help people around the world but not in their own countries.
"Forgiveness, is more than sayin sorry."
Ryan always wins
justice for depp.
Please pour your guests some egg nog
I'm subscribed to Ryan but my vote is for Hugh...
You guys are tricking people into contributing twice, aren't you? I mean, come on, I can't pick and choose. I love Wolverine and Deadpool. 😍
Well, i don't drink coffee, neither alcohol. So hmmmmm
Lovely!
Put the link in the description, efficient!
How do you choose between two angles?? :-)
The closest we're ever going to get to Wolverine and Deadpool and there shenanigans
They should do a movie together...wait
Can I do both?
Who votes down on these guys?
Just love love love these two 😂🤣😂
TEAM RYAN HES WAY BETTER
And we still want a Deadpool vs Wolverine comedy movie. Let this be done Disney Over Lords!
*OR* have a gin and coffee topped with whipped cream and cinnamon dust... hmmmmm
Awwwwwww
I love how their friendship and "rivalry" was born out of them portraying iconic Marvel Comics characters Wolverine and Deadpool. And to my knowledge they've only ever been in one movie together lol
Didn’t know Chris Nolan made a sequel to The Prestige
Ryan: You want forgiveness, get religion
YOU’RE TEARING ME APART LISA!!
Cardinal Canadian sin Reynolds.....no holiday talk before November 11th....you know this.
If my cranberry sauce isnt cylindrical and ribbed for my pleasure then I dont want it.
Somebody's got to grow the beans that the cocaine  Is packed in 🤷‍♂️
Having a bad 2020? Just watch a Ryan Reynolds and high Jackman video. Bam.... Instant uplifter
Still waiting Deadpool and wolverine together big screen
I wait till the very last second just to make sure I dont miss any banter
Damn u rascals, love u both
i really want to see them playing Wolverine & Deadpool in the MCU soon!
You are you and k pop stars so mature?
Hey Ryan can I seriously analyse your channel in my master's dissertation in communication and marketing? Dude seriously it's, like, everything I freaking love it. Keep doing it by the way 😍😍❤
Wow u both look really old now
A movie of this 2 guys will be awesome
This is probably all Ryan, but he's one HELL of a good marketer!!
What if we just side with both of you and demand you forgive each other? ',:3
They are the modern era version of the Odd Couple.
Sorry hugh kids first....
Now?! Now?! Little Jimmy,Jimmy, i mean Hugher Ackman?! Thus! its, Darker Times Right Now & its! the time for some, Ho🎅Ho🤶Ho🎅Ho with some Snow🌨Snow 'chase, if Not? i will run my Hands right through your wifes beard, Meg Reynolds?! if it was like ,Dr Evils🙀Now?! Hohoho,it off with a👊🍸☕Mixd2Get!
Ryan and Hugh should start Unus Annus 2.0
Marketing Department: You have to advertise for Sam’s Club and you have to pick which foundation to donate. So which is it?  Ryan and Hugh: Yes  Marketing Department: 0:54
GO SICK KIDS. Ryan has me on his side. I run extra life yearly for sick kids.
I think Ryan should run for president next
Sorry I’m an American. What is sams club? Canadian store? Australian store?
ahhh... it is friendships like these that make the world go around. That pure essence of underlying bitterness quietly simmering behind the sweetest fake frosting of smiles. All for the sake of the children and a good coffee. Way to go guys! :)
X'D
FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS            RYAN COME BACK TO BEING DEADPOOL
Hihiii you two boys  💗
You guys are just too awesome
It's November
❤❤❤❤
Name a more romantic duo. Ill wait
these two dudes are like ..camberra being the capital of canada , and ottawa being capital of australia.
Stop trying to making me choose between my two children. You're both equally evil, which is why you're both equally my favorite.
who is ryan reynolds
Is no one gonna bring up that a multi-billion dollar company is making us choose to make charitable donations in THEIR name? A company that's so known for underpaying it's employees. Just because you can pay likeable actors and disguise this a a fun charity race doesn't negate the fact that Sam's Club and Wal-Mart are evil corporations and are trying to manipulate you into thinking they arent.  P.S. I love you Ryan Reynolds, you adorable freaking foul mouthed marshmallow of a man.
You 2 are absolutely the best guys in the world 😁😁
Sorry Hugh. I'm siding with the good avenger on this one. Mint Mobile all the way!!!
Ryan is just.. Wade Wilson XD
hey  Ryan & Hugh . . . figure out billing for 2024 and i want Jackman / Reynolds 2024 :)
Sick kids always get my vote. Nobody better mess with kids
I thought you're gonna sing "forgiveness" from the movie "Just Friends" lmao, just think about ryan naked with a guitar in front of Hugh, XD
are u on weed or some shit dud
Lets make it perfectly balanced to help everyone, please.
I think both
They are related because deadpool got his powers from Logan, and there both marvel
ITS NOVEMBER OML
well I was gonna vote but apparently Canadians aren't allowed..
This is like making me choosing to suckle on a left or a right boob. Luckily Motor-boating is a wonderful thing. I choose both. Happy holidays you beautiful peas of a pod.
Ryan won,you're my favourite actor btw and I'm your number one fan
Hey Deadpool..bring back Logan!
I don't understand how someone can dis like this video, Can someone tell me plz.
Forgiveness...... is moreee than sayinggg sorry XD  Who remembers drop a like XD
"The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for." Bob Marley

ok . .. . . but can you show us the claws again ?
These videos are what I look forward to in life
If Ryan Reynolds-Senpai says to forgive someone then we better damn well do it ... wait, why does he need Hugh Jackman's forgiveness? I loved you in Greatest Showman dude but don't make me choose 😅😅😅  Always a Fan Mr Reynolds 💙🐱💙
I thought he was gonna sing that song from Just Friends that Anna Faris sings. 😂
I might go get a Sam's club membership now. I never shop there, but this gives me a reason to.
Never end it....neva!
"Christmas isn't about forgiveness, it's an emotional brawl"  Someone please make this a slogan
What do you get when you mix Wolverine with Dead Pool? A beautiful blood red very thorny rose. Or a bucket of puke. Let's just say: A beautiful blood red very thorny rose in a bucket of puke.
What camera do you shoot your YouTube videos on?
This feud never gets old.
I love Ryan, but I want Wolverine's mutton chops, sorry Ryan :(((((
Not sure how you do things in Canada or Australia, but seeing those Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving are triggering my Yankee brain.
Ryan knows we can´t resist to click with that puppy face of Hugh!
Ryan and Hugh both in the same movie with good writers this time would be epic
I was on the fence, but I love canned cranberry sauce so now I have to side with Ryan.
Is more than sayin' sorry.
This makes me laugh, because it's all about using their "rivalry" to raise money for two *drastically* different charities.
I adore these two.
The stakes: Loser donates to the winners charity. Winner donates to the losers charity.
I wanna see Chris Pratt come out of nowhere and end this battle
this is too wholesome.
I actually like canned cranberry sauce....  so that insult didn't have much impact.
These guys are so perfect at acting like they can't stand each other. When in fact it's also so clear they are such good friends. I want in!
Both of you are perfect
Jesus Christ, Ryan just can't make a bad ad
*giggles*
Sorry Ryan, but Hugh won this one with the "canned cranberry sauce of human beings" line. That's just gold.
Wow it’s huge jack man and almost buff funny man
Those two should make a brokeback mountain musical, it would be an instant classic.
😅😅...Dog poop💩 on Deadpool/Ryan's face/#Deadpoop..😅😅😅
Two national treasures...
Anyone else think of Just Friends when looking at the title???
awww, you guys!  ;)
I like canned cranberry sauce!
Pretty sure I just watched a commercial....
This friendship will go down in history as one of the greatest.  Then it will slowly be forgotten until it becomes the stuff of myths and legends.  Together they spread joy like it's some kind of Gallagher show and we are sitting in the front row
And yet they still haven't had these two onscreen together as Deadpool and Wolverine.  You want forgiveness, Marvel? Get religion.
Team Pool baby!
These two can joke, fight and promote all at the same time and I needed two minutes to write this comment properly.
I have a feeling this "feud" will continue even after one of them dies.
The bromance is real, people.
Haha hated ones
the canned cranberry sauce of human beings XD
Let’s all be honest...all we want for Xmas is a Logan/Deadpool (hard R) movie! The scene would open Logan sitting in his limo waiting for his patron and guess who gets in...this could go in so many wonderful, hilarious directions 😜
Just make a Deadpool vs Wolverine Moive already the Hatred is already there and in addition to that ahem..... how sweet of them to do this
i thought hugh jackman died
So the only way to be a truly good person is to buy from both?
Thought we were going to have to forgive him for Green Lantern
You 2 are the best and no matter what you guys say, I know that deep down in your hearts, you truly love each other. But don't ever stop the feud it's hilarious. And what you 2 do for the community is absolutely a blessing to all who are affected. Love the both of you and I could never truly pick a side.
Can Jake Gyllenhaal get in on this? At this point in the rivalry I want celebrity guests😂
They should've play that Forgiveness song from the movie Just Friends lol
The Feud started today and I work at Sam's Club so it has already drawn a line between us employees... This is going be fun stirring up trouble.
Can i just donate to both. I would feel a lot better
I can't take this feud serious. You can clearly tell that they love each other XD
Choosing between coffee and sick kids? Well there is obviously only one true answer here as these two are obviously both monsters. Choose Sabertooth, what charity is Liev Schreiber supporting this year?
I love wolverine and Deadpool (can’t forget detective Pikachu).
Can you stop teasing us and just make a Deadpool Wolverine movie already.
I don't even shop at Sam's Club...but now I want to
Sick kids or... flippin poop juice? I'mma need a min to think about that one. NOT. (Love you Hugh :>. But go make Les Mis 2: More Mis). 😎
Wow Great
What to do, what. to. do. Do I support the one that brings warmth, happiness and joy each and every day. Or children. What. to. do....
How about a charity fight between Deadpool and Wolverines 😏 lol
20ml Aviation gin 15ml Coffee liqueur 15ml Orange liqueur 50ml Cream  Add ice and stir, thank me later. :/
Wolverine over Deadpool.
and after that ball shaking, what did you two do?😂 👍👍
How they filmed this during the virus?
I love your guys tension since the whole Deadpool and Wolverine debacle. Lmfao!
I was thrown off when I saw the Sam's club logo in the beginning and thought it was an ad and was waiting for the skip button to appear
“Its more than saying sorry”
Sorry Ryan... I go with Hugh Jackman any day
Just start an Ad Agency already.
I pick ryan
Oh Hugh, you've opened yourself open to a slaughtering here fella.
Why am I intentionally watching ads?
As far as commercials go...this ain't half bad. Other than it's Sams Club I could *almost* be swayed....lol
can y'all just kiss and make up already tf. it's 2020 ain't nobody got time for beef w the homies.
The most passive aggressive charity add ever. XD
Ryan Reynolds has such tiny eyes
You know what, forgiveness SUCKS. -RYAN REYNOLDS
We'll never get a Wolverine Deadpool movie, but they should still do a movie together.
Oh no it's a competition between sick kids or coffee farmers so I guess the sick kids are going to win because more people are for life then for other people in Third World countries that are picking stuff for coffee so we'll see who wins the NBA battle of the biggest douche bag Award for helping the poor or helping the sick kids of the world or just the United States but I love how it's forgiven supposed to be forgiveness but it's also competition
you guys... are GREAT, but for once sh@t it and listen... lets help each other... lets both vote for each other and support all those who need our help (thats after all the meaning of forgiveness) after all THEY NEED US.  so... a beverage that is gin and coffee or coffee and gin (oooohhh whatever) would be a good choice for a start...
Did anyone else notice how far apart their chairs are? 😂
THIS! This is the Deadpool 3 we all deserve! Well... To be fair, we don't exactly deserve it. Hell! We barely deserve a Green Lantern 2! But we really, really want it, so...
That wolverine and Deadpool movie i would kill for
Emotional brawl...  I felt that.
Wolverine VS Deadpool... fight! (and no laser eyes... that's cheating) But the real question is, would Hugh be willing to lose his memory like a certain character did if the upside was he forgot who Ryan was? Deep thoughts.
It's like a Twix commercial.
"Forgiveness... Is more than saying sorry...  To forgive is to divine, so let's have a glass of wine, and have make up sex till the end of time, time, time, tiiiiiiiiiiiiiime..."   Samantha James, 2005
Ahh reminds me of holidays with my family.  You two are the best of friends no matter how much you bicker.
You're Bestttt!!!
hugh jackman adamdır
Do I really have to choose? can't I have both?
Both Winners
I'm glad they are alive. I excepted forgiveness video for their families because one of them was killed or at least injured.
Is more than saying sorry
Hugh Jackman isn't the one who makes people WANT to watch commercials. Just sayin'...okay, maybe he *helps* a little. But still...
You boys are true friends.
I won’t buy either lol
A feel like a child watching my parents going through a divorce frigging love these two
Were they in the same room I don’t think they were
Don't you just love Hugh's accent ? Awww... dreamy.
MORTAL FORGIVENESS!!!
I dunno I like Ryan’s sense of humor but I def have a huge Crush and Hugh 🥰
I fucking love those boys
God i love those two guys, i am not gay but a threesome?
Noice
Merc with a mouth, or weapon X... Very interesting
"Forgiveness Sucks" 😂 Sometimes you ain't wrong Ryan
Are you friends or foe, I really don't get it. But I am big fan of Ryan today I watch 'THE PROPOSAL ' AND 'BRING THE COW ' MOVE AND I LOVED IT . love from India ❤🙏
I don't why, but when I saw forgiveness, I immediately thought this was going to be about politics, but then when it was Hugh and Ryan I changed my mind instantly.
Forgiveness... Is more than saying sorry
I wonder what Ryan’s and Hugh’s wife think of their feud?
Perfection every time. Keep it up. Also, if you buy my husband and I a house in Kitsilano, your mom will be well cared for and fed
Can you two just get it over with and make the Deadpool / Wolverine movie that NEEDS to happen?
Is that edible?
a choise between 2 hot guys how do I choose
I vote Hugh, sorry Ryan.
the trade was that I will blow up the house of one of you so who won?
Nah I'm good.
I thought he might apologize for Green Lantern
Screw you Costco you Kirkland castoff! These two beautiful humans show you why you should shop at Sam's Club! :) Happy Holidays!
we all gonna ignore that we're funding Walmart's tax deductible charitable donations while they refuse to pay their workers a living wage while being unbelievably anti-union??
Can you imagine
The best romantic couple of the century .
Damn these two playing wolverine and deadpool onscreen together would have amazing rip logan
Oh these two
Festivus!!!!!
Forgiveness.     It’s more than saying sorry.
With such ennemies you don't need friends.
these two!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
shit, i love canned cranberry sauce
One of the most goofiest celebrity rivalry that ever exist...
I LOVE you guys!
I just love you both.. how can one choose.. from one aussie to another.... or aussie with a definite weird sense of humour and alittle immature n laughs so much over ryan.... sorry no can do..
I am siding with Jake gyllnhaal
Love to see Hugh looking well!
You keep teasing us with your awesome bromance! But you know we want the Deadpool/wolverine crossover
DEADPOOL VS WOLVERINE! DO IT, YOU COWARD!   sorry, that was too mean.
Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman: the silver lining of English Colonialism.
You both are a trip...I Love you both...cant decide on that..haha
When Hollywood can't give you Deadpool and Wolverine together for more that 10 secs, Ryan Yt channel does
Christmas stuff already..? I am highly offended.
Next video:   *"Me and Hugh take over the world..."*
DAWWWWW...
I'll side with Hugh if he comes back as Wolverine.
we need to get me in these
Time of watching. 26 thousand thumbs up & only 84 thumbs down. Says it all really.
Forgiveness... I thought it was about the epic song from just friends. (my favorite movie)
Love the interactions betwixt the two of you, brings joy to my heart that humanity still has a fighting chance against the snowball society we gathered on our journey. Best of wishes and keep the world smiling.
Please never stop this, ever
Team Reynolds ?
i feel like this is foreplay   DEADPOOL 3 NEEDS WOLVERINE!!!!!!!
i feel like this is foreplay   DEADPOOL 3 needs WOLVERINE!!!!!!!
Their entire friendship is a meme
I saw the title and I though...  OH NO
Hey guy who makes a lot of money post the link to sams club in description
ryan reynolds is the ultimate marketing scheme
This is an act.
Hugh Jackman > Ryan Reynolds
Awwwwwwwww 🥰
The only time I ever willingly watch a commercial 🥂
Waait so sick kids or coffee...hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm such a hard choice
i did not get to see wolverine and dead pool interact but is just as good and i am happy we have this.
I love them both
What the feck did I just watch?
Plz upload dayly
Ryan, did you sit in the 'small chair' on purpose?
"So I guess the holidays aren't about forgivness after all"  "Nooo..... they are about money"
I thought they were going to apologise about the movies. But I’m glad this is not actually ending the rivalry
Guys, like I could pick a winner! I choose you both👍
"Its an emotional brawl between friends, loved ones and also hated ones." This statement is the most realest thing i have heard about the holiday happy holidays everyone
I hate it when mommy and daddy fight.
Sorry, Hugh; goin' with the sick kids. Wait. I'm a member at Costco. Never mind!
I love this 😂😂😂 the torture to pick between Volverine and Deadpool is real. But between Hugh and Ryan. I pick Ryan.
When celebrities do YouTube I forget they were ever celebrities.
Marvel and fox just missed the great opportunity to Collab with movie Deadpool vs Wolverine
They act a bit like brothers
I love you both. You make me laugh and cry.
But I like canned cranberry sauce
And the winner is.... All of us.
I chose Deadpool
the feud that keeps on giving
Wdym? Canned cranberry sauce is great
I will have a cup of Hughs coffee with a shot of aviation in honor of forgiveness
I love how Wolverine and Deadpool are such good friends in real life.
I would love to see Deadpool and Wolverine fight it out on the big screen or work together to fight a version of Thanos as the Terminator
Joke's on you, Hugh. I happen to like canned cranberry sauce. Team Ryan all the way.
okay, but canned cranberry sauce is the best cranberry sauce (only the jellied one though)
I love this channel.
Yo Ryan stop sitting like a lady Men sit like they have Ballz lol .
I love the friendship between these two  #poolverine
The description 😂
Ryan has come a long way since a house ate him in the Outer Limits.... Please stand by.
So where’s the comedy friendship rivalry movie with these two that doesn’t involve superpowers
It brings me so much joy seeing how bored you two are and how you've put it to good use.  Ryan's not playing fair, though. He brought sick kids to a local coffee producer fight. Not cool, Berg. Not cool.  Good luck with the numbers, people.
Bro team Ryan ALLLL The FRICKEN way😎
Me- wondering if I will survive Ryan and Huge- setting differences aside (they made for marketing)  and making Christmas ads
Why are Hugh's legs so long???
✨forgiveness can you imagine ✨
@Ryan Reynolds, this is awesome!  I saw on the news what you did for those kids up north by providing them coats, boots etc, and I tell you how my heart swelled up with joy and happiness when I saw the look on the kids faces.  You sir, are an amazing individual and proud you help represent the Canadian spirit!
… you two … /ᐠ｡❣️｡ᐟ\
Best friend group pick: Ryan Reynolds and Hugh jackman                               Or         The rock and Kevin hart
i love canned cranberry sauce though...xD Ryan wins hands down. Come on Sailor you think your beating the green lantern?!
'Like mistletoe, Hugh just makes things awkward' LMAO
Can i choose both
I chose Jake Gyllenhaal
Please make Wolverine+Deadpool movie with you two casting❤
Jokes on you, Hugh, I prefer canned cranberry sauce.
PAHAHAHA!!!!
Forgiveness... It's more than saying sorry... - Samantha James
Oh c'mon already and just fight, Wolverine and Deadpool...
How is it right that these two won't be running mates in the 2024 US election? Because after 2020, we need something positive to look forward to.  Like Free Guy. Or.. uh.. that Hugh Jackman movie about having to re-live 2020 over and over.
Will Wolverine ever fight Deadpool?
Forgiveness, because their gonna be in docter strange 2.
No forgiveness  fight each other😡😡😡😡😡
Why....why are these 2 so great at being wholesome enemies and seemingly excellent people at the same time.....welp, I don’t like Gin (whiskey, neat). But I love coffee and I want to support both of these causes so off to Sam’s I go.
Ryan wins
Sorry Hugh I´m on Ryan´s side.
I guess deadpool discovered a way to be friends with wolvorine
Oh my god are you guys pregnant?
It’s more than saying sorry
Somehow a better love story than Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen.   Also Twilight
Who tf wouldn't vote Ryan Reynolds? Who Jackman?
when is Free Man again?
When I saw the beginning with the sam's club logo i thought it was an ad like the normal ones and was trynna find the skip button. Then realized this WAS an ad and That It had Hugh Jackman and Ryan Renolds. Suddenly My urge to find the skip button disappeared
🟤🟡🟣🔴🟡🟡🟣🟢
0:40 but i love canned cranberry sauce
Ryan Reynolds is the king of marketing/advertisements! I think he played a small part in some movie too but who cares.
Oh this aught to be good also sorry jack I’m with Ryan
Why does Ryan look like he’s sitting at the kiddie table? 😳
Looks like these two will have no problem social distancing from one another.
Pure chemistry
I was really expecting Ryan's voice in the end
In a time of strife and uncertainty, it is comforting to know that some things will never change.
So we have to fight between 2 charities.... Well as long as people are helped.
Hugh and Ryan. The gift of friendship that keeps on giving.
I hope this "fight" never stops
Love it!!!
Man i just love you guys two amazing actors and great foundation support..much love from Iowa!!
Oh for goodness sake Jackman is getting ripped again and he only needs to do it one more time, Disney can then scan him in and have a buff young Wolverine forever, and Jackman can play him into his doddering old age. Same with Reynolds and Deadpool. We could have decades of Wolverine v Deadpool whilst Jackman and Reynolds turn into real life Statler and Waldorf.
We could just go with both 😂
link in the video : https://samsclub.promo.eprize.com/thefeud/
These guys have discovered the perfect formula for advertisement.
Hugh vs Ryan is the new Jimmy vs Matt <3
Hugh: "You're the canned cranberry sauce of human beings"  Ryan: **processes**
mom dad please dont make me choose i love you both   Forgiveness  Is more than saying sorry Forgiveness Means accepting people's flaws  To forgive is devine So let's have a glass of wine And have make up sex        yes i mean sex as well
Watches this   *.02 seconds later*  Buys everything at my local sams club
Friends & Families are really just really close enemies
*sighs*  *slaps nut sack across screen*
I SUPPORT RYAN JACKMAN !!!!!!!!
Frenemies :)
Still my favourite on screen couple
When they you dont shop at Sam's club 👁👄👁
I remember I met Hugh at Ant & Dec’s Saturday night takeaway. He was one of the nicest people I’ve ever met :)
Guys, thanks giving hasn't even started
One thing that never change is u two fighting
Come on do a movie together.Not that superhero shit.A good comedy.
Steve Gleason is still waiting for his interview with Ryan Reynolds. #TeamGleason #SoulToSoul
You two. So adorable.
well if you look it up christmas has always been about sex, drinks and party really, it used to be and old roman celebration that was re-branded by the Church so having Mr.Reynolds and Mr.Jackman trying to fuck each other during christmas it's the most acuarte way to clelebrate it. i think
Oh u two...get a room already!!
Its like I have to pick between my two hot divorced dads
I was having a shitty day but now I'm good:)
Hugh & Ryan: your friendship is a cure for sadness
And I can not forgive you for doing a Christmas themed video this early.   I love this fued.
Love you guys for how you help children!
👌🤪💚
Anytime I see a video with them two, it just makes me want a Wolverine and Deadpool movie even more.
Wolverine and deadpool?
Makes the best of the Horrorday's   I mean Holiday's
Sorry guys dont want to support Walmart, I go Costco who takes care of their employees and offers better products. They donate to eyes for the needy and others. https://www.costco.com/sustainability-communities.html
awww
It is impossible for me to choose between them....  LOVE THEM BOTH A LOT!!!~
I just watched his movie "R.I.P.D".❤️
Fuck it I'm getting both
Best duo ever
give a like if you love canned cranberry sauce
Whatupwitdat?
This friendship is legendary
The holiday is an emotional brawl- so true!
Deadpool V Wolverine!
I love these two.
You guys are the best! :)
They have the real life version of the Deadpool/Wolverine friendship
What do you call each other then?..
God this fued never ends i love this duo very much
0:15 i thought that was Spider-Man for a sec
Still waiting on a Deadpool Wolverine movie. Dont care if its a ret con or a flash back, its just something that needs to happen one day xD. I know Hugh hung up the claws its just a damn shame it was after Logan when they finally got it right.
I love these frenemy skits. Hahahahaha. I love you both!! Don’t make me choose.
A Canadian and an Aussie.  They need a South African so that there is at least one guy that knows how to play rugby. Queue Sharlto Copley...
Love from india 🙂🙂😀 🙏 i want huge Jackman  back as Logan please 🙏🙏🙏
I did my job fore you forty years and I've not been paid one penny yet and that is why I told them to send me my money. They were hired to do a job and they've never done it. I put my money in their pockets and told them to give it back. I was already owed enough money for to long and I needed to know which ones needed to die. Anyone who thinks they are going to keep my 67 trillion dollars is going to have to die first to get away with it. It's already my money. That's how I had control of myself enough to put it in all of your pockets in the first place. You can't keep it from me. I have the bulk. You just got the receipts.  And I'm going to keep rubbing it in your face that you are traitors and guilty of high treason and on record already well documented . You murdered all my children and I have proven it. I had the worst life I could ever imagine. You perverts hide from me on my world . In my galaxy.? Not possible. If you can read this than you can be sure that I can kill you. I can tell you the truth. I own all money on earth. Legally I own it. I wish I didnt. I wish someone else had been forced to do the workload I did. I had the choice to do it or die. On my third birthday I had that choice. When I was four years old I was signed up to work as the most enslaved man that I could possibly be when I learned that I was the only one left who could handle the work load. The emperor had died . And I was the motherfucking head of the american mafia and would be till the day I was dead.
I know, you're not from the US, but this was the most British brawl ever!
I'll sign w both if I can.
I literally aspire to have a friendship like theirs.
Hold the f***ing phone a moment! So, now not only do I have to choose between Hugh and Ryan but now I also have to pick between coffee growers or sick kids!? WTF is wrong with you both!? Going to have to make a donation to both charities now so I don't feel guilt! Merry f***ing xmas to you both!!
They’re like 2 brothers of  a big family who had a lot of rage but can’t hit each other anymore so they announce a fight on YouTube because they are rich and influential                   we just enjoy the chaos
I'm siding with whoever didn't put up those Christmas decorations when it's not even half way through november
Isn't laughing man coffee owned by Hugh Jackman? Deadpool wins.
I'm going to Sam's Club and voting for Ryan. :)
Damnit! Sorry Ryan, but I must side with Huge Ackman, on this one. Screw kids, I'm a coffee junkie.
I feel sad for Jake 💔
Star Wars
Great video!
Epic videos Ryan
Super para aktorów Kocham Was 😁😁😁 Hi From Poland 🤗🤗🤗
Upload the "Arguing" version, I think is funnier, please 😂
Too bad all the Sam's Clubs in Alaska got shut down.
Hey man when is deadpool 3 comming please dont make it to family friendly
Have I been doing the holidays wrong for all these years? *Wow!*
Never change boys, never change. Your shenanigans bring everyone endless joy and laughter.
Turn on Dwight Schrute mode : 0:10 Ryan started the fiyaa !
S a m ' s C l u b <>
Man Christmas in November and it brought to you by Sams? Awesome
Ryan wins
Get a room already😂
I would choose both of you or none of you. I'd hate it if this rivelry stopped.
Oh my gosh Hughs accent
👍🏻👍🏻
I love this so much
This channel became advertisement
Did you find the Easter Egg ?
Ryan is it normal that I get high when I drink laughing man coffee
Can’t we have a Hugh and Ryan movie? Like full comedy and action?
This is the best celebrity feud since Martin & Lewis.
Frenemies    There’s the answer   (Btw I just like Hugh a bit more than Ryan, sorry dude)
Wolverine and Deadpool always be like yall Ryan and hugh but skill always be a d*ck to each others and help out like bros an my words are true in comic book speech.
Will I go to sam’s club? Uhhh hmmm “Definitely, maybe”.
So how far away from youtube slap fight are we at this point?  Maybe use sockum boppers?
No, this is an ad. The holidays are about the rich encouraging the poor to spend and make them richer. BTW, if you don't think you're poor, you're poor.
I mean if Ryan's celebrating Christmas this early then why not do the same?
Jenever or gin (because -enever apparently was difficult to pronounce for the english) + coffee  has been a thing in Belgium for a while.  https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasseltse_koffie  Then again we used to mix it with everything at some point :-)
No
Don't you love it when it only works in the US? My favourite...
they're both great actors but even they are unable to properly pretend to be anything else than absolutely lovely human beings who are BFFs.
Love these videos. I wish Ryan would start doing some vlogs or something in the future too or just some goofs or anything
Friends are great and all, But do you have a Nemesis?, cause their always there for you.
I like canned cranberry sauce.
It's like when you meet your best friend in the world, make one funny video about hating each other. The world loves it so you have to keep hating each other while slowly dying inside from loneliness. I think that's what's really going on between these two
Can't you guys just love each other?  Physically?  On camera?  For all?  I'd like that.
Yes after they kill themselves I'll forgive them. Over got a big heart.
Sorry Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds takes the cake!
me searching where is the nearest sams club
Just can’t support walmart
I really want Hugh Jackman to come back as Logan for Deadpool 3.
🎄 🎅🏼🍁🍂☃️❄️🥧🌰 The Holidays, an emotional brawl. Ryan Reynolds. Perfect description for a lot of people
more entertainment in one minute than an entire series of many modern tv shows
Yeah, Ryan has to be sorry for green lantern and Deadpool in X-Men origins Wolverine.
I am with both Hugh jackman's and Ryan. Renolds sides
I wish they had sit come we’re their neighbors and are rivals comedy gold
still want a deadpool / wolverine team up movie.
I loved canned cranberry sauce. How is that an insult? Looks like I'm Team Ryan...
wow, Ryan really just is a real life deadpool
Like- both Comment- none
Christmas? Michael Bublé's christmas album is not even played on my local mall yet
Where's the Kimmel vs Damon one haha
Even though they fight each other they are the. Best friends like  two teddy bears hugging each other , Like ying and yang
These two need to do more movies together!
I can't pick sides 🥺
This is awesome
👍
The French Bulldog doing his "Business" on Ryan's picture! Classic
"*Is this is what recreational drugs feel like*" - Ryan
I legit saw this upload and went like... oh they are at it again... 😐 😂
Be Sure To Drink Your Ovaltine. A crummy commercial?
We need a Tango and Cash remake with these two in it!!
I would donate to both of ur foundations
i mean i see Hugh i click
Ok this is just ridiculous. Hugh or Ryan? Piss off Wolvy! Then ok let’s decide between coffee or sick children?! Gtfo! Coffee for the win!!!
Gotta love that YouTube drama. The only thing missing of for Ryan to drag Pewdiepie into this. Now that would generate some web traffic 😆
BRAVO👏😂 I'm going with Ryan, sorry Hugh, strictly bc of  the charity. Coffee is a stimulant. Also, Ryan has a seriously twisted sense of humor, I can't get enough of in this life🤦🏼‍♀️🤣🔥🔥
Closest thing we've got to Deadpool x Wolverine on live action.
Love you guys!!
bro you're an Aussie!?!?! WTF!!!?
Lol this is great thanks
🥺
I love their bromance. 💙💙
I'm so confused on what is for real and what is a joke about these videos 😶
I still ship you too....you cant change my mind XD.
Bruh, that chair is too low for Jackman...
This was glorious and made my day
Ok i forgive you
Am i allowed to side with both?
Make it Irish and mix some drinks. Get wasted first thing
This is one of the best Friendships I have ever seen! I love then Both.
We need them together in a movie
This is adorable. <3
So much truth, finally!
Just do a deadpool and wolverine movie already :)
I swear these two need their own sitcom
Now if Wolverine and Deadpool could get along like this anything's possible LOL😂😂😂
Deadpool and wolverine are so cute together
Such hard times and your video reminded me of someone I used to be with just like this
ROFL!!!!!!
These two should run for president.
*BEST. BROMANCE. EVER.*
Are they really enemies?
Peace was never an option
But I like canned cranberry sauce!
i dont speak inglish  puedes poner subtitulo en español por favor
Insert Wolverine and Deadpool jokes here.
You Two know me I'm the Demolition Man aka The Punisher aka Maverick aka Rogue One former member of Seal Team 6 Delta Force TWA 847 1985
OMG! So much win! 🤣🤣🤣
Uh, or we can side with both of them & continue to wait on "Deadpool 3" in the MCU.
Perfection!
Question. Is Ryan Reynolds a better actor or a better salesmen?
Rarely is selling out so entertaining
Just one to say that I love you both and canned cranberry sauce.  Gotta go with Ryan on this one!  🤗🤗🤗
Stark and Cap meet again
Isn't Christmas December not November i'm pretty sure your about one month off. was it Hugh that thought it was December?
The bromance is alive!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Funny stuff
Can you please just be friends with Hugh cos you two are the funniest comedic duo and I'd love to see a Hugh's Wolverine and your Deadpool
Love the sarcasm Ryan Reynolds creates and because of that Poor Hugh Jackman gets frustrated. 😘😂
I always love to watch Ryan Reynolds YouTube channel always so funny! 😀. Ryan Reynolds has a lot of talant, he's always so awesome.
Team Deadpool  All the way
samsclub.com/thefeud/  as there wasn't a link in the descrription
if this is true then I am very sad I don't get shop at Sams Club...either way I loved every moment of this video thank you Ryan.
😭This is so great! I hope this continues forever! ❤
This rivalry will go to the history books
What happens when Deadpool and Wolverine work together:
I swear if we don’t get a Deadpool and Wolverine I’m the same movie for at least a few minutes...the possibilities!
How old are those chairs?
lol
You sorry sons a .......
Guys, you should make some buddy movie together, something like Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon. I wanna see that! :D
It seems Canada and Australia starting a war is a thing that can be real.... A war of awkward forced  hugs
Ah yes... another dose of Ryan’s and Hugh’s colab
Ryan: Hugh forgive me...for exposing you for the monster that you truly are (this is why I love him)
Mr. Reynolds, Hope you are well.  Just thought this would have been so hilarious if you busted out the acoustic guitar and sang the Anna Farris song from  "Just Friends" 'Forgiveness.'  I would have died.  Take care.
When Canadians and Australians fight......♥️
"You are the canned cranberry sauce of human beings." is my new favorite insult
We don't have a Sam's club close to us.....I may have to go find one!!
#teamdeadpool
Hugh seems younger      Well he is Logan so...
Sign up is US only, which is a shame.
I feel so dirty now.
They hate each other so much they made a video together.
Love Hugh jackman fantastic actor and Ryan reynolds as well
Does there have to be a winner? Can we just declare a draw or no contest?
Marketing Guinness he is !!! 👍❤️
I am fan of logan and deadpool  pls sir comment
There will be only one of us bragging at the end of this.
Support Ryan Reynolds, Just do it
Their "Feud" has a better story than the Sequel Trilogy.
Who is going to help coffee farms over god damn sick children man
🤣🤣🤣
these frenemies need another movie together
Now all these two need is for Jimmy Kimmel and Matt Damon pick sides.
I can’t choose between Ryan Jackman and Hugh Reynolds or Aviation Australian Coffee and Laughing Man American Gin. They had to make this difficult! And they are both immortal so I’m gonna be thinking about this literally forever!
How about siding with both of you and for this shit messed up year just do some good
I love that these two have made entire careers out of a non-existant rivalry.
Man i cant choose between my 2 favorite actors
two of them are the best
Can we get a reality show of Hugh and Ryan living in a house together for a week and just see what happens
Can we just get a wolverine dead pool movie please. It's just gotta happen at this point.
Hugh and Ryan make the best combo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB2Rw-p2tI8&t=2s
Wolverine and deadpool is needed...
I want Ryan...so goddamn bad...
The perfect cast for the Two Guys and a Girl reboot.
It looks like Hugh is getting devoured by the chair
Turtle,
green lantern
You gentlemen crack me the eff up. I love it :-)
those are great. i love when they make 'em. Origins Wolverine created something good at least. well the videogame and this feud.
Ryan Reynolds found out the perfect algorithm to bypass adblock.
They say they hate each other, but it's obvious they love each other.
I side with ryan
What if I get both?
I feel like they’re gonna hug on christmas
just make a movie already
God I love these guys!
well at least someone is getting something out of this
Who else came here waiting for Anna Ferris to come out and sing Forgiveness from Just Friends
Bruh
Can we please get a Wolverine vs Deadpool movie?
So is Ryan Reynolds a full on YouTuber now
The Jackman/Reynolds bromance is something truly special
You can just feel the love in this video.  #Deadpool3 😁
I hate it when the Daddys fight       But I also love it!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't cchose between u guys =_=
Deadpool and wolverine crossover!!! wooah!!!
<3 deadpool
Well. Ryan is buying Wrexham football club...so you kind of have to question his judgement.
I love canned cranberry sauce.
Damn can’t even vote because I’m English 😭😭
Deadpool Logan crossover confirmed
I think channel name should be changed Ryan & Hugh
My sity ❤️
“The canned cranberry sauce of human beings” oh my god that’s going on the list
Delicious
I need a Romeo and Juliet movie starring their children
This channel is like the longest meme ever
Forgiveness...... ....... ......... Is more than saying SORREEEYYY
ok
Can we get Shane Black to write these guys a buddy cop comedy movie already?!
Good job guys for doing this... giving your time... supporting two loable foundations.
YES I am herd in New Zealand and i am on Team Ryan
You know the holidays are approaching when your two dads start trying to fight each other for your love.
You guys somehow manage to do commercials in a way that both makes me want to watch them, and also share them... and I HATE ads :P lol
😅🤙🏾
Please have a link in the description
A noble rivalry with a noble cause
That a hell of a way to make money off of a pseudo-feud!
I just hope Disney will make a Wolverine and Deadpool movie. It doesnt have to be part of any universe. Just it's own thing...
And that was the last time sams club has ever been used
Well. I guess I'm shopping at Sam's club this year.
Avengers: Civil War
Is not even thanksgiving yet
We would be forgiven if you play among us
The memes are the best
thanks for the chuckle
This is my favorite youtube channel😄
Forgiveness is more than just saying sorry
It's no nut November not Christmas
Is this actually the biggest marketing trick ever ?
2020 just got better, but still don't know how?
Forgiveness...is more than saying sorry. Forgiveness...means accepting people's flaws 🎵🎶  Catchy Tune 😛
Keep your enemies close, and your nemesis even closer.
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG            ITS DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE!
Awesome
Wolverine and Deadpool need to get along! Professor X Mas is just around the corner and I must side with my fellow Vancourite for the sick kids over morning refreshMINT liquids ;)
Ryan and Hugh: People really love seeing us talk shit about eacther, they really eat that shit up  *dozens of successful commercials and ads, a succesful whiskey company and a succesful coffee company later*  Alright lets give these fuckers one charity ad, we've made enough money
You both should have your own tv series!
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
I thought my listening skill was not that bad. Now, can't wait for the subtitle
THE FEUD!
I forgive you for green lantern reynolds...green lantern Reynolds green lantern.🤬
Who else is Canadian? 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
BET it was recorded on different days on two different sets made to look identical!
With enemies like these, who needs friends?
I love this channel, its literally a meme
I love both of these men. There's no way I could choose a side here.
"Wolverine x Deadpool"MCU MOVIE🔥🔥🔥🔥🤩
What a unique bromance  :)
So what you are saying that I can't have a Laughing Man Coffee flavored Aviator Gin?
🤣🤣
Duel of the Fates
They seem to be friends from the beginning of their life on Earth.
Support a corporation that fleeces small towns of their businesses, refuses to take responsibility when they've wronged or harmed one of their customers, and generally treats their own employees like dirt... for your charity.  Yep, that's what I'll go right down to my nearest Sam's club and do!
Mockery is fun isn`t it? :)
this channel is a blessing, no doubt. loving them both since forever!
F U N N Y !!!
I love their friendship, they need to make a podcast together
These 2 are ❤️
Laughation gincoffee @Ireland Crabtree
Come on Ryan its barely November
Man this must have been how Sophie felt.
#friendshipgoals
🎶Forgiveness is better than say sorry🎶
Well played, Sam's club. Well played.
I have always legit loved canned cranberry sauce.
Ryan, we need to have a talk. Canadians have no place on your website to place their vote and spend their money. I am utterly disappointed. Please amend this, it is your maple anointed duty.
How you’d settle this Ryan and Hugh?  Answer: A Liqueur Coffee.  Coffee with Gin. Best Coffee + Best Gin = Best Friends.
Lmao, I love this!
Ryan Reynolds is like super man had bat man wings with deadpool katanas 😂 lol this sentence makes No sense
Ad companies should take notes from you. If these ads are in YouTube i bet most ppl wont use the skip option :D
I wonder if Ryan will bring the sweater back again! Lol!
"The canned cranberry sauce of human beings" lmfao
We want Deadpool corpse vs wolverine.
I love these two. The way they work together despite their obvious distain for each other, just beautiful.
These two butting heads always makes me laugh!😂
Christmas is time to spread love. Oh, wait....🤣
Brilliant 😅
Hey it's the RM William's guy and the Aviation Gin guy
Just watched the gin ads. So funny
The world NEEDS you two right now❤️❤️
We should get a wolverine vs deadpool short film
Waited for this!!!
america's two chief campaign strategist in 2024 (if only cause neither can hold the office themself)
At 1100 today, it's Ryan up at 137, Hugh is at 99. I voted for Ryan.
I want to see Hugh Jackman come to the MCU as himself, in a Deadpool movie. I want Deadpool to drag Hugh Jackman around the film expecting him to actually be Wolverine, as Hugh Jackman gets progressively more shot up and injured as the film goes on, confused as to why this nutter in a red suit thinks he is this Logan guy.
Summary: This is War Forgiveness This is Warrrrrr
I can't choose  😍
I want such enemies in life
To be honest Deadpool always was a better character than wolverine especially when it came to the healing factor
The most entertaining  fake feud
I agree with the cranberry sauce comparison. Like canned cranberry sauce, Ryan Reynolds is the best part of the holiday season.
No no no
Never have related more to a video
My favourite two men in the same video, loving each other as always... 😍😄
This doesn't make up for "X-Men Origins: Wolverine."  But it's a start. 😁
Oo God they have such evil choices, I am gonna choose both😅😅
00:12 That Face tho..!!
"I ship it" :>)
Fore five ness
Aviation Gin + Laughin mans coffee =a very subtle way to reinvent Red bull, boosts your energy, with the downside of hungover
The claw with a mouth
I was hoping for an epic ugly Christmas sweater rematch...
Can I pick the third option? Make a third Deadpool movie starring Hugh Jackman as Wolverine 👍
it's 10th of november and you are talking about christmas holidays...
I like sam’s club pizza.
I love this channel cos it’s just a meme
Lovely
You don't get here unless you're true friends.
We are All WINNERS while being entertained by this awesome friendship... I mean feud...
I love you can tell ryan improv his part.
Forgiveness, is more than saying sorryyyyyyyyyy Forgiveness, means accepting people's flaws. To forgive is devine, so let's have a glass of wine. And have make up sex, until the end of time ....time....time..... time...
I'm very fond of canned cranberry sauce actually.
Ryan Reynolds won’t pin this haha poo poo head
Well, I like Hugh better, but I like Ryan's charity more, so.......... Pick both, I guess ^_^
Surely these pair can push through Deadpool vs Wolverine! Please make it happen 🙏
Either way we all win!
Yall like 2 internet trolls whom meet each other irl
I'm surprised there are only 200 votes on the site right now
Bully Mcguire : you want forgiveness get religion
Australia Had Sex With Canada While  married to the UK and Canada engaged to the US. They're twins unknowingly.
I love these guys man.
All I see is two clowns or should I say entertainers.
I would pay for a movie ticket to watch in theaters a movie about Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman argue about Unicorns and Cotton Candy... If theaters are still a thing after this Pandemic I hope.
I love these two, even if if one is an Aussie and one is a Canadian.
jackman wins
Still like them both. Hilarious 🤣😂👍
Finally.....God damn
Well, they are social distancing
hate 🥰😁❤️😁🥰
Can you imagine
Can you two remake, My Two Dads?
Wolverine and Deadpool: just the buddy comedy pep talk we need in 2020.
I need to see  Hugh as wolverine fight Ryan as Deadpool in a r rated movie!
The thumbnail looked like the guy who played the vampire Angel from Buffy the vampire slayer.
It would be nice if you showed the full Sam Club Link in the Video AND have the Link in the Description.  BIG Fail.  AND You're welcome.  I would post it here, but YouTube would flag it as spam.
Ah the colonies are having a spat. How nice.
Wolverine and deadpool movie now 😝
My only wish is to one day get a Deadpool/Wolverine movie
can i do the both???
These 2...I swear. What would happen, if these 2 starred in a movie together? Too much star appeal? Too much goodness? Too big a Box Office $uccess?
Canada versus Australia: whoever loses, we all win.
hugh jackman & ryan reynolds will be 90 years ols and still be going on about how much they hate each other
I love canned cranberry sauce!  Whole berry or jelly.  Like Ryan, it is sure to bring a smile!  (I do enhance with orange zest, but that’s another story . . . )
They are like that 2 kids who always fight but when they seperated, they miss each other
What about those that belong to Costco...? Darn! Now, I will have to get a membership to Sams Club too!
<3
Spettacolare 💪
Meh
The closest we’ll ever see live action interaction between Wolverine and Deadpool
I am beginning to thing they are actually buddies.
Everytime Ryan uploads I'm just like, "Ooh, advertising!"
“Forgiveness, is more then saying sorry” -Samantha James
This is hilarious 🤣 I love these two. They make me laugh every time the get together.
Holidays: An emotional brawl between friends, loved ones, and hated ones.
Wait hold on what just happened?😂
Deadpool can hardly hide his disdain for wolverine.
oh my god guys it's wolverine with deadpool!
This isn’t about forgiveness, it’s for giveness .
Support Ryan: Provide care for sick kids.  Support Hugh: Coffee or some shit.  Gee, *I WONDER WHO I SHOULD SUPPORT...*
Who needs wolverine in a Deadpool movie?  we're already seeing them together for a really long time .........
I'm not sure which fake feud I love more. Ryan Reynolds v Hugh Jackman or Jimmy Kimmel v Matt Damon.
Its the Holiday's that I really feel for Blake. Given that their yearly charity video with Hugh is about as close as she'll get to anyone who's gone down unda this year.
to anyone wondering sams club is only serving americans.....the rest of the world loves you both, but mainly Ryan
It’s like they both r a born pair. Made to live forever. Never gets old seeing them together
I just feel sorry for Sam; having to work with these two LOL
With such friends you don't need enemies.
1:07 Just say, "lovers".
This is one war I can support 100%
i'm offended. the title says forgiveness but still i don't see no one asking it for green lantern.
I have an idea, Love/hate not buddy movie.
Why does deadpool looks like Ryan  😅😁😁
Epic Rab Battles of history is the only way you 2 will ever decide a winner
Bro .. no way in hell I could pick one of these two
Where's their buddy cop movie?
12 sorry ass ppl have no joy in their life's, I dont forgive you
I like cranberry sauce though
Ohh shit wats this a tease of wolverine vs Deadpool lol 😂
Jaja no entendí ni verga pero adoro a los actores 😎👌
i need it international. Hello from Europe :D I tried to enter but i am from a Republic not a State
can somebody PLEASE MAKE THIS A MEME
"...loved ones ALSO HATED ONES--"  Nice save Ryan. Seamless.
This rivalry is more entertaining and engaging than any political debate in recent years
I get the feeling this will end as a draw.
its funny because i unironically fucking love canned cranberry suace
I don’t think I’ll ever get sick of watching these two.
Hey Jackman you should have bought a Citizens watch https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQPLGakv2e1F2NJBLaqDPCcu9OWXAbWAmatte black
Sorry Mr. Huge Jackson but, I don't drink coffee so I'm going to help the sick children.
These are the best ads ever... I seriously might go out of my way to Sam's Club now
Hugh Jackman is like if someone pissed into a rundown gas station sink then tried to clean it with the blue sponge in the urinals.
If your both reading this I think you both need to shut up and hug it out and finally make a movie together it doesn’t even have to be about deadpool and wolverine you guys got range you can both do musical for crying out loud (Ryan we’ve all seen the masked singer so you know what I mean) just hurry up and bro it out already.
Sam's Club nice score
please Logan Deadpool movie
So wolverine and Logan team up to bring happiness to everyone this christmas. That sounds awesome! Why can't that be the plot for Deadpool 3? Put Hugh Jackman in a x-mas themed Wolverine suit and it's perfect!
Sadly I'm just slightly too young to be able to donate 😅 but I absolutely love this friendly feud!!!
Those are the true frenemies.
Jokes on Hugh. I like canned cranberry sauce
im from to iraq baghdad Flow
That's a true sequel to *Truce* .
How is every video in this channel so great?
Just do a Wolverine and Deadpool movie....🙏🙏🙏
our Deadpool and Wolvarine together
They should just kiss and make up already!
A friendship such as them few people share around the world.
Can someone please drive dump trucks full of cash to their houses to get them to do a DP/Logan film before it’s too late?  Or a season of “The Feud” on NF, we deserve something good to come out of 2020.
couple of the decade lol
These two are pure gold together 🤓💛
Well, I guess I'll do both in the spirit of unity.
Why these two do not make a movie of this is beyond me.
Ryan should make Hugh an honorary Canadian 🇨🇦
They would be the only reason I would shop at Sam’s club
Just kiss and make up 😉
Deadpool and Wolverine 😂
Lol
Oh, Ryan were is the holiday spirit?
You guys need to add link in the video description
I'm not big on coffee soooo......
Who else got this in their recommended?  Forgiveness *recommended for you*
I find it so fitting that Deadpools actor and Wolverines actor behave this way
Oh
0.45  Maradona is that you?😂
Ryan Jackman is the best combination you can have in your life
I’m going to get a sams club membership just for this
Sup
Well... I like canned cranberry sauce... so...
Wow christmas came early this year
love these two  no better bromance then this
Come on Hugh... one more go with Wolverine and be in Deadpool 4
Ryan wins instantly no discussion
So we’re getting a Deadpool vs wolverine soon in phrase 4
These two define male friendship🤣🤣
i choose Ryan he wins i'm a bigger fan of Ryan Reynolds than Hugh Jackman. LOL
ryan i am a huge fan i loved you in deadpool and the proposal
Does any one else feel like that Reynolds and Hugh Hackman are my gay fathers?
An Australian and a Canadian walk into Sam's club.. Sam says "Oi, y'Aussie knuckletrucker.  Ye can't bring that roo in heya." *Deadpool strolls in on mooseback* "Did I hear unclefucker?"
page not found
Wait wait wait do i die? Just i see 2 handsome Angels 🤤🤤🤤 OMG i'll see this video each morning 😍💕
Ahhhh... that's nice. Using your powers for good.
Two diabolical humans who I love love
Ryan Reynolds! One glorious day, we'll meet!
I want to see a boxing match.
first
Mix of coffee and gin..Huh Definitely something only Deadpool and Wolverine would survive after drinking. 🙃
"ryan is the canned cranberry sauce of human beings" "like mistletoe hugh just makes things awkward"  aw their faces after they give each other these beautiful compliments! friendship goals
This is like choosing the blue or red pill.
Hello warm from me. I admire you a lot. My daughters are young. Thank you
Forgiveness Excepted
Ryan and Hugh are the power couple of the world
Wolverine / Deadpool buddy comedy when?
You both are awesome.
*_Perfect video about rivalry doesn't exist-_*
Can you imagine?
As much as I love  Ryan I'll have to say I'm on Hugh's side of this feud. We used to go to laughing man in New York so.... I have to side with Hugh. My Mom met him.
It's never about forgiveness, _it's about sending a message_
You guys are Great! Love 💘 you both and the Causes you support. Thank you both for all you do!
ID RATHER HAVE GIN YOU CANT STOP MEEEEE!!!
Am I going to have to get a Sam's Club membership just to participate in this?? Costco, why didn't you get in on this!?!
please make a god damn movie together
Ryan: post a video   All of trying to comment the first 😂
*Forgived*
I vote Ryan for president of the world
This whole relationship is a advertising goldmine and I'm not even upset. Good on both of you to make the best of the attention on you!
This channel is just a meme.
JUST DO THE FXCKING MOVIE WE ALL WANT!!! AND YOU WANT TO DO IT TO!!! GAD DANG IT!!!!  #whereisapaperbag...?
Hugh I love you but Deadpool and sick kids beat Wolverine and coffee farmers 😂🤷‍♂️ Good luck sir.
This legend duo should make a movie
I guess the WOLVERINE really does come out of him at times.
And it continues....this is great
... and the Canadian buys a kitchen knife and the Australian goes thats not a knife and pulls out his knife and says now thats a knife.
Do you accept mail-in ballot?
I think I'll go ahead and contribute to both since you're both disgusting human beings, equally. 😂😉
Rayan gin makes you drunk and increases the possibility of committing a crime. Huge coffee wake you up and makes you see the world for what it is and helps you make your miserable life look a bit more clear. Huge is the good guy here wake up people!.
Haha! Jokes on the both of you suckers. I bought one of each!
hugh: i help coffee farmers  ryan: i help kids not die, but _heeey..._ coffee's pretty neat too!
Ryan Reynolds
Celebrity friendship, done right
Just do a fucking deadpool and wolverine movie together!
Always love seeing these two ❤️
Im sorry but I love Hugh Jackman more than you.
canned cranberry
Who do I choose, one sexy man or the other sexy man? 🤔
Awesome video guys!
Rise rise aviation gin !!!
Seems the two of you just have a blast
You know what?       I think you do
Yes
I love a feud that helps charity
Trump won USA
I vote Ryan Reynolds
I still believe Logan and Deadpool will properly meet on the big screen
I Love you Ryan you have been making me laugh since van wilder man you are an amazing actor and also an awesome person.
I hate sams club it’s a knockoff Costco but I guess I’ll have to buy something to support Ryan
Sams Club?
So when is the motion picture of Wolverine Vs Deadpool?
🌸🌸
Awww you guy's are hilarious..Love you both! 💕🙏💯we all know you love each other 💖
I'm thinking there's a bunch of kids that could use some coffee.... somewhere.
Gin just brings back bad memories of grape Kool-Aid and 15 year old me with zero tolerance for liquor.  Coffee is life.
Get a room u 2
Hugh forgive me (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
at this point              Im Interested in this Channel
I want to see these two in a movie
Ryan Reynolds all the way! 💞💞
When this pandemic is over, I hope Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds gives us a Wolverine and Deadpool short film that the fans deserve. (I said short film because Hugh is done playing Wolverine on the big screen.)
Hi
I'm loving this bromance way too much. We all need a relationship like this in our lives 😆
f*ck it reynolds im early
Всем привет!
Two of the nicest guys being dicks to each other.   Now that's acting. 👍
Dont make me choose which dad.
Lau-gin man coffee. You'll get h-y-an caffeine.
Всем привет!
u the best actor
Yo what up Ryan Reynolds
Let me put some dirt in your eye
Its either Hugh or Ryan, deadpool or wolverine i just can't decide because their both my favorite actors/characters
Damn, Hugh really got the butt end of the stick this time. Sick kids or grapes, like wtf do you think I’m gonna choose?    Grapes for the win
*Love almost as passionate as between Sherlock and Mycroft...*
😂
Forgive me,  but it's  really hard to choose between the two. So I guess I'll sign up for both)
315
This would be so different if they weren't both mutantt
Nose ingles y siempre veo los videos xD
that when you are ryan reynolds
These 2 should do a therapy session for couples
😂🙏🙏
Hi Ryan
The best duo ever !
Ryan Rosling and Huge Hackman
I like both Ryan and Hugh, Awwww, but the kids. How can I not side with the kids?
You both really need to do an outakes reel....it would be hysterical
It’s a shame we never had wolverine and Deadpool in a proper movie together
Ryan and Hugh are the best bromance out there.😂
I god-fucking wish they would star in a movie together. I mean. Such a thing NEVER happened, right? RIGHT?!!
A little it of Joy when we need it the most - Thank you Gentlemen
Ryan
Now kiss.
It's for the greater good.
Whenever I see Ryan Ronald and hughe Jackman I see Deadpool and wolverine chatting about hero and side kick🤣🤣🤣😘
just make a damn movie together!
I truly do not know how you both can do this commercial without extreme bouts of laughing or can even do it with a straight face.   I just look at the two if you and start laughing with anticipation as to what is going to come out of your mouth....thank you both for putting some laughter an happiness back into our days!!!
where's jake 😭😭😭
Вы хорошая парочка 😂 ✊
the only ads i enjoy
Even when they hating they look cute.
i love watching ads
OMG In love this fucking legend
Honest to god these two are the embodiments of the character they play.  Deadpool and Wolverine.  Damn near act like them irl too!
Forgivenesssssssssss, is more than saying sorryyyy
I legitimately thought that while Hugh was gonna plug his coffe foundation to help people, Ryan was gonna plug his gin!
Good try at forgiveness though
I just love how much they hate each other, I mean don't like each other, I mean don't trust each other, I mean ...
Cuties
"I forgive you for being the horrible monster you are" HAHAHAHA! He says that like its nothing. Just so casual like he's been wanting to say that 😂
I was listening to wings of apocalypse with this and it fits so well
So, are these guys bangin or what?
two children fighting over the remote controller and i love it
This is how I know deadpool is gonna fight Logan in the next movie if Logan comes back to life
Okay so now i can't care about coffee workers and sick kids at the same time. Oh Lord forgive me!
The battle of sick kids vs coffee farmers. Who will win
A world of haters 🙃
I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends
I Want the Gift Pullover back
After reading the title I couldn't get that song out of my head from "just friends" lol
HAHAHAHAHA, loved the bit about mistletoe.
I've never clicked something so fast before

EARLY GANG WHERE YOU AT!!!!
hi
🤣🤣 the feud we never wanted to be end ....
You know they snuggled after this...
Keep bringing the filthy Ryan and Hugh
wow
my favorite actor upload once again
I side with Ryan Reynolds
1000:1 dislike ratio
Love to both of you, just more love to Ryan Reynolds:)
The sexiest and funniest feud ever!!!
many questions so few answers
I just wanted he to play Wolverine again just to cut Deapool in millions of pieces for 2 weeks
The best frenemies.
Deadpool wolverine movie when?
I can feel the strong and true friendship between them 🥰
The best duo we could have asked for.
Amazinng
Marvel should just do a one-off film totally outside of any X-men/Deadpool timeline [not like they haven't done it before!] and just let these two have their movie already!  It's not like Disney couldn't use the money...
Well, I know who I am voting for
"Forgiveness is more than saying sorry."
Oh you kids and your silly Sam's Club.
If these 2 with their love/hate bromance were any cuter, puppies would be jealous.
Hiii
If I wasn’t living in Germany, I would be renewing my Sam’s Club membership to support both of you.
in literally less than one minute 2.5k views

Now, if only I used Sam’s Club...  Them: For The Feud! Me: ...%#>$

God I hope there’s a movie at some point where they play a couple.
That's one way to promote the holiday spirit.  Can I chose both? Coz both causes are very good
Hey ryan ... Big fan man
DANG IT! Why can't we just love you both!?
Ryan don’t lie he’s like a brother to you
Reconciliation is impossible
This is wholesome but I also don't wanna take this seriously. Frienemies
I love these two
