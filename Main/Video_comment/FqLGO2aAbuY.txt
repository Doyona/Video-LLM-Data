i  can easily draw hands with online refrences
I hide hands and drawing and sculpting never do hands they drive me nuts
I like the line out but the coloring is not what i expected
I had homework for Art class in school which was to draw my hand, and then draw my hand holding something.  So I drew my hand curled up, and holding playing cards, so I didn't have to draw all my fingers etc.  I actually got a B for that, because everyone else just drew round their hands.
I suck AT “HANDS MY ARCH NEMESIS
I am a wizard I can draw hands easily lol 😂
Rae: "drawing everything I'm bad at"  *turns out perfect
This necromancer has far too much flesh
Drawing hands can be a lot easier if you start Drawing a stick figure hand circling the joints then Sketching the palm into a square type shape and use rectangular blocks for the fingers. You can adjust the proportions at this point then round your sketch off. It's a great way to practice.
I have that exact same lightbox
Me a character design artist who started drawing to make my own characters:*hears she struggles to make original characters* “I’m so proud…”
I do this fine lining style sketches every day behind my math notebook 🤣😅
Everything you said you suck at, YOU SPANKED RAW in under a day! I've said it on a lot of your videos but, JUST WOW!   I wish Girl, lemme tell ya, there are a lot of artists or creatives out there like me who GENUINELY ARE bad at things. Lol I thought I was about to feel comforted, nope my azz got checked lmao   S'all good.
She lying
Hands are actually one of the easiest things to draw for me- TvT
I’m a wizard
my sugles are of cores hand and feet , colouring  ,realism and Anatomy I like cartoon dawing
What is the name of that music you draw too
OMG this video not only spoke to my heart, it also solved a huge problem I am currently having! Thank youuuuu
I have the same exact light box!!!
This a so random but I hate when people are like ( no hate to u Rae), for you watching at home, but what if I'm at the airport waiting to board the plane. In a whole different country while watching the video-
Function of beauty made my hair fall out though. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤔
Your hair looked like ariana grande 😅
6:11 A widows peak is a Dominant trait. If you know anything about DNA~~~~~
Strange- I do have a problem w/hands. I drew a Jonas in the whales mouth--stuck on hands.  I still have the drawing: waiting for me.
I’m a wizard harry
"I'm concentrating so hard I forgot to breathe." That's a whole mood. And also I was concentrating too so that actually reminded me to breathe as well lmao.
The shampo is 1,342 baht :’(
I always find it so interesting when folks with shaky hands hate fine lining cause, i have very shaky hands and it's one of my favorite things to do lmao
Shaky hands high five 😅
I don't really have that much trouble with drawing hands anymore bc I started drawing hands a lot to get good at it bc before I was so bad at it
OMG thank you so much for the app!
What mechanical pencil are you using?
The one thing I can't draw rn: boys
The people who make anime: I'm a wizard ig 🤷
Yellow and purple are complementary colors so good job on that, plus purple and blue go well together so it ties the piece well.
U not suck
Good
Not true ur a hood drawer
I can't believe it took me this long to realize you are left handed.
Rae:I’m bad at drawing foreshortened people Also Rae : create a masterpiece
fine lining is my fav.😆
14:29
Dog version of function of beauty function of boey
7:46 you sure that was not for hiding the face? 😃😃
ok i didn’t know the style i commonly drew in was comic book lol. now i know
i can draw hands super well and u do too!
Im sure you know but I really appreciate you showing this. I'm still new so it gives me hope.
Gives me klaus vibes
also Rae you did an amazing job finelining
i have a shaky hand and i always mess up finelining (going outside the pencil lines etc.) but i still do it bc i suck at realism
It’s so cool and pretty!
Rae thinks her art is bad then what is my art… trash.?
Your character looks like ember from danny phantom
This turned out really good Rae 👍🏽
Ur been da always out a smile an my face
i do a lot of drawings but if i draw something i suck at i always end up making something bad.Once i tried drawing masaru bakuguo from my hero academia but i just couldnt get his eyes right and....In the end when everything was great his eyes were those of a chicken
I love u art
Hey
More comics style drawing please ^^
I didnt realize she posted this on my Birthday - lmao
You should color neon yellow her eyes, too
i love how the dog was sitting (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
At 13:20  in the video she stuck up the midle finger at the paper! 😭😩🤣
What is intro music?
Sorry but I’m not for masks
I've seen all the videos of this series and realized that   Everything Rae is not good at, I'm amazing in and everything I absolutely suck at, Rae is amazing
Let me draw things I’m bad at me YOUR 100% LYING YOU ARE NOT BAD AT THIS!.
7:44 aaaand I’m done with your channel.
3:00 after the sponsored add when she’s actually about to draw.
IT has never *Been* Bowie... we are still waiting the day..
The Magic Poser is exactly the app I’ve been looking for for a long time. Thank you for sharing it!
lmao i love darling hands it sounds weird but i really love doing drawings that involves hands and tbh not to toot my one horn but im really good at them
I have that same light box 😃 it is really cool!
You should do : drawing things that I'm bad at with the art supplies that I hate
I wish that I could draw like you
Not me watching this at 1 am. Rae is literally an inspiration
I REALATE TO U 👏👏👏👏👏👏 ON THE FIRST AND SECOND ONES and kinda the third
You’re lying.
The character reminds me of Ember from Danny Phantom.
Isn’t the kneckromancer from the hobbit
i cant draw chocolate
Someone count how many times she said “HaNDs”
I have a widows peak. I feel eh about it
I honestly love drawing original characters. I mostly like drawing witches.
Literally ever artist struggles with realistic hands. I tend to just draw cartoony hands and it gets the job done.
you flipped me off
4:40 I only draw animals so if you find a animal thing like that                                                                                        *Plz recommend me to it. Plz*
An app I can also recommend for drawing poses is pose it. It does have ads if wanted just to use for free
how can she not fell pain from the spiral of the book she is immortal
yay i am a wizerd
I think that having the ghosts be red would be a better fit for the drawing, but that's just my opinion.
Hands are soooooooooooooooooo hard
when practicing with what you struggle at, i highly recommend doing some studying instead of trial and error, its a lot less frustration. idk if deviantart still has a tutorial section but i did a LOT of growth there!   books are also helpful, but unless its by a master of a *medium,* i dont recommend most books on art *styles* unless its by someone in that specific styles profession, and one whos style and taste is one you like. particularly if youre at a craft and art store, most of those are a lot more misses than hits, with the author commissioning artists for the book or trying to teach outside of what they know for money
She's badass!
Just be confident about yourself
I suck at life🙃
Oh so you want me to draw everything on earth???
3:16 ye I suck at hands specially because I mostly sketch small things I never draw something big I always accidentally draw something to small
i can do hands alright now, but you know what i actually struggle with? feet.
OMGGGG GIRRRRL YASSS
i can draw hands but i need a photo of an hand........
Love it 😊if you don't want to draw the lips and nose you can add a mask and if you don't wanna add the eyes pupils you can make em white lol love you tho no offense just a joke
GMOs are good!!
If I had to draw everything I’m bad at, my title would be drawing everything you possibly can draw. I’m bad at it but I like to see other people do it
Your terrible my dream

Things I’m bad at drawing - drawing

I suck at hands to XD And for shortening I bad at drawing original characters Im okay at fantasy I draw comic-ish like the ones that dont have color and theres a lot of grey and stuff Im really bad at backgrounds SO BAD that I don’t even make a background
Are you kidding me your art is amazing! Keep it up!
Something weird, my middle name is Rae
She's actually not that bad at drawing the things in this video, learning to do that stuff  could take some people years, but you're actually pretty good already 😃
And tho ur not the only one I also have a very shaky hand
Even I struggle at drawing Hands🧤
If you have an art style it's very easy to create hands in that style by yourself- lol  protip: use your hands to draw 😀
"Because when they use there userpower there eyes go white" Me:you sure thats not a excuse to not draw them 🤨 (Jk,jk 🤣)
"You know what I mean..? " 👁👄👁  Calm down rae we get you!!!

In the intro your dog is in the back LOL
As a kid, I didn't have access to a light box. I didn't even know they existed! When I needed to transfer one of my drawings, I would tape my drawing and the new paper to the window. My mom would give me weird looks, but at the same time called it clever. XD
That hand is better than mine
but....i’m good at drawing hands....somehow
Your bad is my UNIMAGINABLE good
Rae :has a whole bag of pens  Me: Only three pens yeah i have so much pens
Ibyudv pUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUERA HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHE

Please please please do another drawing in this style. I LOVE this piece!!🙌🏽
RAE THINKS MY HAIRLINE IS COOL! I’ve always hated my hairline
If I did this I would need to literally draw everything in this world.
You talk with your hands.

Hands are SOOOOOOO HARD to draw
Thank u for getting me into art
I would do this challenge if i didnt need to draw every single thing in existence
i literily have the same tracing table.
As a cartoonist/comic artist, this video made me say really a lot. Because She had a hard time with stuff I am used to doing all the time
Rae : I suck at drawing hands and if you can draw them well, your a wizard. Me : Hmm.... So the creator of my hero academia, Kōhei Horikoshi must be a wizard with the love of drawing hands and is well at doing it ;-;
Oh your bad at drawing them? What about me I can’t draw a human body but I can draw Fnaf charters but I can’t draw bodies...makes no sense
wait did she just... put a mask on it i-
👏S👏A👏M👏E👏! Just also struggeling with tourette's
Moriah Elizabeth will be happy to see this because she has a widows peak hairline and she calls it her “weird hairline” but i find it cute lol 😆

3:07 Aw thank you 😍  Ment as a joke, hope I don't offend anyone
Drawing starts on 2:55
“I love when the ladies have tendrils” 😂 out of context this statement is iconic😂😭😂😂
Me: OK SHES BEEN FINGER PAINTING WITH NEON YELLOW.
Was it just my pre-school or  did we, as littlies, use the window as a lightbox to trace instead of an actual lightbox?
My dad is an artist and me a bit but my dad always mes up when he draw a hand
8:04 why not aang (or any other avatar for that reason)?
Drawing everything I’m bad at. Me: I can’t do that- I need 3456 millon books.Because I’m bad at drawing everything
Her: I’m not good at it Me: waittttt that’s bad what!? Brain: teach me your WAYS
im kinda good at hands tbh
girl you did it all perfectly wtf
I tried to draw all of them and it took a long time and she did it perfectly!
Question in the Art world:  Artists, is it possible for you to dislike having to draw?   Rae: foreshortening & hands Me: *touched crying* *YES!  I AM. NOT ALONE!!!!!!*
I like fantasy,           *so I'm interested.*
Me, a nonbinary person when Rae says “ladies and gentlemen”:  👁👄👁
widows peak.....you mean mcdonalds hairline
Things I’m bad at drawing:  Realism  Hands Charcoal  Character interaction  Like if you agree.
I just realized we're both left handed! So thats cool i guess
*hands.*
Every time I wach you drawing I feel like drawing
If I made this video, it would outlive Queen Elizabeth.
I'd love to have this as a sticker or print 😍
" I've never created an OC "  me am OC artist: wait that's possible?
I n e e d that pencil rn
Anybody think this girl‘s like moriah Elizabeth?
I suck at drawing realistic stuff so i cant draw realistic hands but i can draw cartoon like hands and im happy with that !!

2:50 here use this as ur replay button
A great drawing, but also accidentally Ember McClain fan art lol
Tbh it looks terrible the anatomy is wonky the angle looks very off and uncomfortable it just looks weird ngl
I can draw cartoon hands well.
Draw a dinosaur :D
Thanks TO FuNCtIOn Of BueTY FoR SponCerIng mE    Me when I got it:AHHHH MT HEAD IF FUCKING BURNING HELP
The fact that I'm left-handed and never noticed that you are too makes me feel very stupid for some reason.
When she said “widow peaks are cool” I have one so I got so happy because will get made fun of about in class
Let not lie no one can do hand and be happy with it
*gasp* hey Tal! she like's your hairline XD
I love this she is so good at this she should draw people more and sometimes even anime🤭
2:50 is where she starts like after the sponsor stuff..
gurl- I just noticed Rae is a lefty ;-;
When her "terrible" drawing is better than you can ever draw
I can draw anything really easy I can draw hands really easy and animals and people especially horses
OMG YOU SHOULD OF COLORED THE EYES THE YELLOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COOL!!! Just an idea!
Her “bad drawing” looks better then my drawings
If I made this video, the video would be way to long
2:50
I skipped 3 mins and the vid just started              But im sure it'll be entertaining
Suck a drawing hands too...
She draws everything she sucks at  Me:drawes everything
i LOVE this series  It’s always so inspiring
Your nails are 'wowwww'
my friend be like: is there anything special she sucks at drawing? She sucks at drawing everything me: Shut up, you can't even draw a smiley face that looks good
Besides PRACTICES something I find making new drawings especially with angles are using graph paper and like if with a person draw them straight facing u and ur u want to draw thier hand angle differently count how many blocks it normally takes of so u know how many blocks u need to manipulate in the angled position!!
6:53 looks like a genie rn
U have the same key bored as me yayayay
Idk man I love your hair in this vid
You: I'm bad at drawing at drawing hands Me: I can draw hands easily not to brag
Its so good
That looked amazing and I subscribed to your channel a few days ago and turn ed on my notifications
Love your nails!
“Draw something your bad at!”  *draws normally*
Im a young anime artist ehehe,and i always struggle with arms and legs HAHAHAHA,i love to draw eyes though
something about the hand just bothers me. i don’t know what it is but the hand gives me flat....ish vibes or just lifelessness vibes either way it bothers me 😅. sorry tho.
I got a dove shampoo and conditioner ad in the middle of the sponsor lol
Thanks a bunch for the app Rae...really helped. Amazing video too.
Those nails are so perfect for your skin tone!!
It's really expensive. Too small for my money bag/purse
I have a widows peak, I’ve always been insecure about it as I was bullied because ‘I was balding’ according to people at school. Thank you for including one on your character, it really boosted my feelings towards myself and hearing you say that they are cool helped a lot. Thank you! ❤️
I guess I’m a wizard 🧙🏼‍♂️
Fin lining and hands im so BAD at like i dont draw hands fin linging i use that sometimes bruh.
I suck at fine-lining to but I am a perfectionist so I end up with like a million tries all with like half a drawing yet all with a small flaw  that really annoys me
Rae: today I am going to draw everything I suck at. Also Rae: *Draws a masterpiece* Me, who has been training in drawing these kinds of things for the past 5 years but still no improvement : 👁👄👁
That looks like an undead warlock (from World of Warcraft).. Your art is fantastic!  It makes me wish that they had a long ponytail customization option.
i`m a fine lining master but simple shapes and body proportions I can't do
I have a widows peek and always draw one just bv’s I have one this is so funny😂😂
Wait wait wait....... Let’s talk about how she is left handed
Ok i went right onto it and it’s a pretty cool questions and I’m planning on getting all you can also do lotion and body wash!
to learn how to draw hands where a glove and draw shapes on the glove that make a hand then pose ur hand and then draw the shapes on a sheet of  paper and then u can start like this for practice then u can draw a hand and itll be like its an everyday doodle! i hope this  helps!
I'm horrbile at drawing hands i make it look like a two-year-old did it
I can draw hands
S
It's a shame you didn't mention Vegeta with the widows peak
Me: turning my fan on: beep boo- Rae:I’m gonna give her tendrils! I love it when the ladies have tendrils! Me, whipping around, dumbfounded: um wh- oh bangs, she’s giving her bangs....
I love that you’re stepping out of your comfort zone, and this  drawing turned out awesome!
So pretty
Rae are you good at fractions?
She said that she's bad at it but she's actually good at it
I love drawing. But im BAD at drawing:(.I love drawing a cat:)

Welp gotta draw everything
Hands and feet are sooo hard

Plz make next part tooo...

LATE: your more gooder then me
just wanna say to all of you ppl being self depricating about your own art skill in the comments,, this isn't really gonna help you improve anything- You can look up to Rae and compliment her but it's really not a compliment if you're constantly being hard on yourself :(
ig i am a wizard bc uhhhhh i love drawing hands lmao
I don’t have $50 to spend on hair stuff or else I would. My hair is pretty short and has no real damage so it would be a waste mostly. Maybe one day.
Hands are really easy once you've got the hang of it though-
Oh no
hands are easy HEHEHEHE
How are you an artist and still manage to look good🤷
I fucking love drawing hands xDDD
Hands.........            They scare me...
When you said hands I almost screamed in anger-
I like drawing but I'm just bad at it 😂
The final drawing is so dope😘
OMG! So glad they do NZ! Honestly not many websites i've been to ship to NZ~ Or come with subscriptions to NZ so... THX SO MUCHC RAE!
She says she sucks, I CAN’T EVEN DRAW A LINE!!!
Hands get easier the larger you draw them (hence why all my character have giant hands >w<)
ME : sees nudes        also me : *digging a grave for when i die looking at this*
You did great!
3D Magic Poser

You could start by tracing your hand and adding  details that's how  I started
Honestly drawing hands is easy but no bragging rae dont worry I got tips on other vids of yours
I’m now a wizard    The sad thing I know how to draw hands
*WHO SAID BOWWI ISNT FUNCTION OF BEAUTY?!*

God bless!  Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and died on a cross for our sins so we may live again in Heaven where there is no pain or suffering!  God is our Father and Creator and raised His Son Jesus from the dead!  Confess and repent of your sins and trust in God even when it’s tough!  Live for Him as He died for you! 💕
I'm bad at drawing everything except cats. They're not realistic but they look good.
i expected this video to have nothing in it
how is it that you're perfect at everything you do?
Hello! I love your channel, but I’m wondering,  what brand of markers are the ones you were using for her clothes? I want some lol  Nvm I found them
The long and orbit hand also reminds me of star fire.
To anyone who needs to hear this leave a like so more people who need this can see it     I am the opposite of Rae I can't draw from reference and I can't draw realistic art I only draw very animated drawings without shading or colour or sketched out lines in the beginning or anything I just draw doodles from my imagination but I'm still one of the best artists at my school so that just proves to you you don't have to be good at fancy realistic drawings because everyone has there own style of art and it can be amazing  Edit: anyone reading this comment down below what you are good at and what you are bad at
i have a widdeos peek and people make fun of me and call me ronel micdonnle  sorry im bad at spelling
suppereadizzle level at drawing 5,000,000,000,000,009 me 200
How can she be so good at making her oc while mine is-- nevermind.  I SMELL TALENT 😤
I’m ok at drawing hands
I have an amazing imagination and am really good at improvisation and stories but my art skills are trash  Your imagination for characters suck like u said but you are absolutely amazing at art
why does that look like lady gagas vma performance costume. you predicted the future
ZHC is proud of you
Things I am terrible at drawing, animals, humans, everything but horses. I can only draw horses
5:45 Guess its not normal having 41 original characters and 4 anime characters with alternated personality from both canon and fanon living inside your head   Not to talk about the fact that I thought it was normal for people who create characters to have at least one fantasy oc, while only three of my characters are normal living beings O.o
Woah omg I haven’t been here in like two years and your hair changed! It looks so good omg
I can kinda draw hands easily... I'm getting there anyway... Kind of... Also foreshortening is a bench (shout out the all the good place watchers lol)
Hands are actually my favorite thing to draw, I feel like they look so perfect in my style. I had to learn fast when I made a four armed character lol
1 day ago 1 month ago
Love this! ❤ I literally CANNOT draw. I'm decent at coloring, but I need to learn more about adding shadows and highlights. I just recently got into coloring with alcohol markers and I really like that a lot, especially adding some colored pencil and gel pens in. 😆
Wow thats so good, i love her.
can u please be my art teacher at school!!!!!!!!!
i think i have a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy small widows peak hairline or something something-
What’s the name of the background music in the beginning
1:43 welcome to Australia mate. (I am Aussie don’t come @ me)
This was where she shows us that she is actually not back at drawing anything
Rae: I think it's normal for people to struggle with this.  Me: HANDS, DEFINITELY HANDS!!
The gourds hair tho- xd lol so bootiful also did u know wat u were were doing the whole time??
The worlds shakiest hand more like the worlds steadiness hand xd lol 😆
Wdym bad at drawing ur lie the best ever !!
HEH
I really dont get why other artists say drawing hands is hard. Its nothing. Most of the fingers are the exact shame shape too. Hands are the kind of thing I draw when I dont want to think too much. Oh wait....I dont hate it because i love measuring. Other artists don't really seem to like dealing with measuring and symmetry.
I see that she loves dem painted fingers ❤️❤️❤️ gurll I love them too😍
Is it just me or does it look like shes filming on a wall
Rae:i suck at hands Me:i suck at cyrcles and keeping the drawing even
Omg i have   the same lightbox as rae
Bob Ross: Paints fast as hell without holding his breath Every freaking artist’s gravestone: “here lies ____. They died of suffocation, because they decided to be an artist.”
“Drawing things I’m bad at”   **DRAWS LITERAL MASTERPIECE**
Funny on how what u draw “terribly” (which is actually hella decent). I can draw it easily
Pff
The be like *Ariana grande who?*
I can’t draw everything i’m the world doe...
Girl! Your not bad your perfect! You and my sister are amazing artists!!!  (My sis can draw turtles!) 🐢🐢
She said she is so bad at fineling and later her fine lining shows perfection-...I seriously dont understand...
Nobody: Me&Rae: Hands shake terribly while fineling...
When she kept the kim possible reference i freakwd out cause a lot of people dont know abot that show
I can't even draw a straight line with a ruler 😭😳
My stupid self just realized you’re left handed
That moment when she says that people who can just draw hands no problem are magical wizards:    Me: pulls out a pen and draws a hand on a sheet of paper...   I paint portraits a lot so I dont usually put hands in them and a friend brought up how it was the perfect way to hide the inability to draw hands and I felt kinda offended cus I can make hands.       Why is it wierd??   I have some tips?   Uhh I find that people when drawing from the wrist to up the pinky make it completely flat when it isnt, look at your own hand and it is actually slightly curved like this --> (      I hope I was helpful?
your dog is very cute
"I keep forgetting to breathe BC I'm so concentrated" SIS MY FRIENDS NOTICED THIS SHIT WITH ME IN GRADE TWO AND YOU'RE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO'S SAID IT ALOUD
hands are so easy to draw its the second eye thats the problem
"Drawing things im terrible at"   Me : **draws everything in the world**
Wow omg it's so beautiful
Her nails be poppin!!
CA IS IN US
I play Diablo too     I play the third game
I use the demon hunter! My brother also loves the necromancer.
Does anyone else just like taking those beauty quizzes even tho you know you’ll never buy any of it you just do it for fun
Yes comic books
the comment under me is beautiful  *keep this going ;d*
When i know that drawing is harder with left hand : 👁👄👁🤧🤧
Love the pic!!
Rae: anyone who can draw a hand, without a problem, is a wizard  What I Heard: Your a Wizard, Caylee.
Oh damn that ponytail is THICC
Rae: If u can draw hands easily then you are a wizard.  Me:*being a potterhead* On it   😂😂😂#WiseRavenclaw
07:11 she kind of looks like Sindel from Mortal Combat
I want to see a really good artist to draw Skyler Gisondo! Will you? I just think he would be an interesting person to draw
Cool
:| it took me 2 hours to draw six bodies that were foreshortened. dunno if i'm good or rushing
I think u can't make lines bc uri a lefty
Can you do my art homework 😭
I always draw widows peaks. I hardly ever draw without a widows peak. It’s just my style lol
don’t use ovals while drawing. i see you struggle a lot especially when drawing hands. unless you are an animator, use rectangles (bad english sorry)
You should do this, but, the MOST Difficult medium are you work in, like maybe digital.
Hellow from phillipines here I’m your number 1 fan i like arts to your so good at painting drawing and all in arts my mom says wow she’s so very good at that
Every artist sucks at drawing:  The other EYE

It’s so crazy that Rae is super good at everything I suck at and now I’m convinced that I’m mostly good at what she’s not! 😂💕✨
Your nails have some nice billie eilish vibes :D
A commercial interrupted  her commercial message. YouTube is really sucking.

Anybody else want her to make this but I’m a more realistic style?
you should draw more original characters! They look so good!!

I like that her characters wearing a mask like shes in quarantine 😂
Cartoon hands aren't hard, I'm too lazy to do all the details in a realistic hand tho 👁👄👁
My tip is to create a full name first

We both are so different you are bad at it I am good at it you are good at it I am bad at it😂
*pee*
I love these videos! And I’m always glad to watch them because you seem like you’re practicing but also being very creative. 💜 I notice you’ve been doing a lot of gimmick-y videos lately (which is great! I love fun stuff!) but I just wanted to remind you that lots of people will enjoy the occasional more simply edited video of you working on something you enjoy,  just as much, so if you need a break to just art, I hope you will. 💚 Loved the final product on this one!
I just realized that she’s left handed
If this were my series this would last forever
" You're a wizard Harry! "  I am a wizard!
I have not seen you on t YouTube in suoch a long time
Rae: "today I'm going to draw everything I'm bad at" Me watching the video about half way in:  " that's better than what I could do times 5!!"😯👍😍
Amazing ❤️
Amazing
Video idea: Use the” IKEA ART SUPPLIES “ /REVIEW
I heard if you get a hair straightener and straighten your paper it will be blank
Wow that’s an awesome drawing! Nice job Rae!!! Love you!! BLM!!
Mario theme?  Yes love it
Rae your art is always amazing and ik your trying hard,I apologise for any hate you have revived :(
MY HAIRLINE AND BITS IN FRONT FINALLY SOMEONE HAS DRAWN IN YES
Ok but I only came here to see her drawings not about a beauty product
Rae: “ I am bad at drawing these things”  Rae: *draws the thing she is bad at*  Me: I can’t even draw those things as perfect as you draw them compared to how you draw.  Me: *draws and anime looking dog*  Me: oml, the only thing I can draw right now is female humans, horses, trees, foxes, and that is about it.  Edit: I think Rae can draw more stuff than I can. Tomorrow, I am going to draw things I am bad at to get out of my comfort zone.    If you have made it to the end, congrats on reading the whole thing. I will give you nothing.  *gives nothing*  Now you have it.
she said what she said she suck at drawing these things ( that is so good what the heck)
PFFFFT YOU SAY YOUR BAD AT DRAWING HANDS??!!?!?? YOU NEED TO SEE ME
I just spent 4 hours drawing a picture and i cant finish it because i dont have color pencils so i watch this

Rae = It's not bowie.. It's never been bowie  Bowie = *dang* 😒
Umm hey Rae remember when u said u would make a vid on how to turn printer paper into watercolour? Ya I’m still waiting. (No hate btw)
If this is a "terrible" drawing then how dare you insult my stick people like that-
This was totally just a ploy to get us to watch her draw her fantasy OC. lol
Omg
FEET are my bane D:
When she says she’s terrible about drawing these things yet it still looks amazing
I love how you added a mask😂
She started out as starfire and transformed into something else
Gosh why do hands seem so simple but are so DIFFICULT to draw aaagh
Me : draws everything in existence
Yoooo the drawing is sooo good

Rae: I'm going to draw things that I suck at Also Rae: draws it perfectly Me: I can't even draw the simplest image I've found on Google
So in other words u need help drawing poses bc u suck at that
I can watch your Chanel for hours.
You should change your style to that
Looks like starfire from Teen Titans
To every artists who never struggled to draw hands (if there is any) you have all my respect

Me: ha! she cant draw the things she suks at.  Rae: hAhA mY pEnCiLs gO zOoM zOoM.

Hi rae my name is Sophia and I am 9 years old I just want to say you inspire me so much to do art you are my favorite YouTube artist!!
Have you ever played D&D?
It's really interesting seeing other artists struggle with something I don't usually struggle with. Like, I have little to no problem with the things you tried here but I can't do portraits/realism for shite. XD
Ariana grande ponytail
Me being good at drawing hands:WhAt?
alternate title: drawing everything, i am terrible at drawing
Oof, I guess I'm a wizard. Drawing the hands is my favourite part of art, I also love drawing hands in complex poses and I'm pretty good at it.  But not realistic hands.
She talks about her sponsor for the first two minutes and 50 seconds for anyone who wants to skip 😊
Could you please do a review on the prismacolor scholar colored pencils!
Can you do reaview on camlin brush pens ???, they are the best.
Her dog has beautiful eyes<3
I named her Vexannah
U don’t suck tour drawings are WAYYY better than mine and love your mum she so sweet
When you said necromancer all I could think of was the anime  “is this a zombie”
“drawing everything im bad at” Im honestly jealous and feel personally attacked these drawings are so freaking perfect i cant even draw a stickman
0:26 I have that exact pencil 🤣
Girl dye that hair right back cause it does NOT work
can u do art with u bare hands  P.S. it might ruin your beautiful nails
Scissors
THE DRAWING CAME OUT SO GOOD WTH KDJDIXBDISHSOSLBDDPWBVDJD
My mom coincidently uses function of beauty but it just made her hair more greasy than having to wash it once a day she had to wash it way longer just to get some of the grease out I use it now and it’s ok I just wish it made my hair more fluffy 😕 still a rather good shampoo and conditioner
This one time I was drawing James Charles in his Coachella photo from 2 years ago and his hand was limp at his side and I gave up so hard that I decided to take pictures of my self with my hand wrapped around to my front to use as a reference for how his arm would look. I went to the farthest extent to avoid it!
i draw my characters with a widows peak
HOW how do people make masterpiece when they haven't it before... 1-like = you know how I feel.
Honestly when you just had the sketch ut reminded me so much of Starfire and idk why
beside shego how about starfire
apparently I am a wizard.
Can you do a collab with zhc ???
THE DRAWING IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m a lefty and I can’t draw a perfect line please help😭
wait how are hands so hard
i saw that you used ohuhu markers to color this drawing, and i recently got got some ohuhu brush markers myself. so do you have any tips on how to use brush markers?
wdym there would be nothing to draw THIS IS A LIE! <3
Anyone know that feeling when you watch a art tutorial video, go to follow it, and then immediately forget what the video said?
How  r u bad at those they look fantastic
I like your nails
What’s your OC’s name?
Thank god the soap is vegan! I cant wait to get my hands on some cause I'm starving!
is it just me or does she look really similar to Ember Mclain from danny phantom 🤭  like... 👀
Are your nails real
8:43 Rae:  * fiercely shakes opened fine liner over drawing * Me: *ANXIETY LEVEL 1,000,000*
the fact you always choose the necromancer is a huge compliment
oh, I could fill 67 sketchbooks with things I'm bad at drawing. Examples:         *everything*
Girl you nailed it 😍😍
I'm not the best at hands, but I *can* draw them
I think u really have to make a video trying GRAFFITI
IM A WIZARD
So when are you drawing manga ? 😂❤️
Me: **slaps hand on paper** Me: **traces hand** Me: :3
Her nails be brighter than my future
To be honest rae draws everything so perfectly and pretty no matter what💗
I find it so cool that the artistic style that I tend to go for is starkly contrasting with her usually realistic so I REALLY appreciate videos like this where artists tackle a style that they've never tried before or don't generally use. I feel like I learned so much about color schemes and shading characters from this video because she literally listed out what she was doing step-by-step and why she was doing it. It's stuff like this that makes her one of my favorite art Youtubers.
i mean this in the least selfish way possible... i am SUPER encouraged that you also have trouble with fine-lining lol.. its ROUGH
With the hands challenge thingy, I'm over here with an OC made out of hands and actually likes drawing hands to bring more detail....so I guess i'm a wizard. "You're a wizard Steven"
Draw something without bending your arm
I have the same mechanical pencils, am shook
Black pink is the raevoultion
Hi,Rae.I have some extreme bad crayons .I bought them for 0.20$,just for fun. I did a video on my yt channel,and I have some other videos about drawing like a tour on my sketchbook ,my doodles etc.Can you watch my vids please🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻.If you watch them can you feedback me on this comment.pleaseeeee I’m an young artist ,only 13 years old .
fettywap
A little advice when doing pastel colors instead of useing a black fine liner use neon pink or blues so if you make any mistakes its not as noticible.
It's good to challenge yourself. I loved it.
this has nothing to do with the video but I'm traumatized. I just witnessed my mom getting her cheeks clapped in the living room.  I almost cried, that man is like 20 years younger than her.
i can draw hands pretty easily
I have fiction buety
Rae: I have a really shaky hand Also Rae: Uses her left hand to draw
I HAVE A FRICKEN BUTT HAIR LINE I WOULD CHANGE IT TO A WIDOWS PEAK TY
...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Same.
Só fucking cool

I feel ya... I can barely make a human
... the best thing I draw are hands and i cant draw anime or a people
Im super good at hands and im 11
Rae, I have the world's shakieest hands too, due to my thyroid condition, it makes drawing smooth lines very difficult. Drawing or taking pictures even in general. Pop sockets make it possible to take a good picture on my phone.
I have a widows peek
Congrats for 200 videos!!!
Tip bout hands: if you have one hand doing your position it makes it so easier to do your sketch and get the base layer down, aswell as the details. So yer there ya go❤ Btw love your nails
im great at drawing hands..... i thaught it was easy.... check out my channle to see em
Please make an art video with u doing art with everyday garbage if u choose this please shout out sankavi
Reminds me of Ermac on mortal kombat😅
Ya, thanks for telling how bad I am at drawing.

Anyone else realize she’s using a 5 bellow mechanical pencil? Or just me
W o w

What you mean it look like your a artist 😲

I am so glad she did the comic-book style. I love the drawing.
I mean sorry if there is auto correct in there
So I’m sorry if there’s any auto correct in there
I don’t know how you’re not good at drawing that stuff because the outlook to mazing and it looks as good as all your heart and if you think that is trash and you think I’m insulting all your heart do not think that because I think your art is amazing and I think that is amazing I think you should stop saying such trash things but yourself because you are amazing artist and I always hope to be like you one day
Her nails are so good

If someone painted my hands accurately they'd look like the wonkiest hack hands you've ever seen 😂 They're just all kinds of odd if you look closely. Tiny, tiny, pinky, index as long as my middle one, etc etc. So you know, life is art 😂
At least you draw hands better than me XD
Funny how we both suck at almost the same stuff

THATS SOOO COOL!!!!
I am OBSESSED with drawings hands
That art was awesome Rae. Truly. I loved it!
Rae's nails are so freaking pretty!!! Im also jealous of her talent, but I still love her art.
NerdyCrafter, aka Jackie, recommended the amazon basics drawing set for u. I would also like to see what you can do with it in a future vid.
her struggle with hands voices every stylized artist (anime, cartoons, etc etc)
*when the art Rae sucks at is better than your own*
Drawing things we suck at Me: Sucks, as expected  Rae: Does it amazingly   I feel put in check.
Rea:I can never make a perfect line without messing up .me :no one can
Hands are easy for me but foreshortening is hard. Idk, I’ve always had a good thing with hands.
Omg I think this is reas first sponsored video
Rae can u plss say hi to me plsss 😢
Can never draw the things we suck at enough, might get sick of drawing them but still good practice 😃
Nobody's gonna talk about the fact that she looks gorgeous 😱😱😱

How to draw hands correctly: Put ur hand at the paper and trace around it 🤣🤣😅
left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed left handed. me too🥰
its beautiful
Oh my god it looks sickening🥵🥵
Ur not bad at drawing anythingggg!! I love u and u inspire me every single day
She deffo filmed this in more than take 😭😭😭
for fine lining, I've found you can do sort of what you do with sketching, in that you do little bits of the line at a time and just being sure to start from the end of the line you already did. I have really shaky hands too, and it's honestly one of the things I find most annoying about myself, but "sketching" my lineart has improved things tremendously.
Now seriously Rae and Moriah Elizabeth have to do a video together
Me as an 11 year old also agree that drawing hands are diffucult lol
I knew the colors would be these haha
Im surprise zach has not comment
I understand almost all of these struggles save for character designs because thats what I do best.
Omg!rea palm just looks like mine not even lieing 😶😶😶
But u said u suck at it.👁️👄👁️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i cant draw!! i think...
This series is begging to be sponsored by Skillshare. In fact I'd LOVE to see you re-do this series after taking corresponding  Skillshare classes.
This is actually a "Drawing everything I am extremely good at drawing, but I haven't tried yet" video! I love your work!😍
damn rae that looked sick
do realistic drawing of art supplies you're using  lol
WAIT IS SHE A LEFT HANDER
That nail color though  😍😍💚💚💚
*I have been inspired, ONCE AGAIN*
I still think your good at drawing
These days when I see glowing hands and energy blasts, no matter which show it is, I think Dragon Ball.
But dem nails doe ❤👀
Dude this is so cool!! I love the colors and shadows, it looks amazing!
You just mad because your hair crusty
It's funny because I predicted the white eyes the blue hair and the glowing orb on her hand 😂😌🦸🏼‍♀️🦹
rae i have question for you. Why is the Gray paper you Use?🅾👄🅾
I  love your  vids😍🥰😘❤️
Hey rae wassup i think it would be awsome if you did more art challenges like the three marker challenge or another one color challenge. Thanks love you tour awsome
Shw looks like she's breaking out of a grave ahh I love necromancers soo cool
This video was uploaded on my Birthday!
I admire you so much for going outside your comfort zone, Rae. I was just thinking today about how when I was a kid I'd just sit down and go for what I wanted to draw. Somehow along the way, I've gotten so timid about "messing up" that all I'm doing is coloring... and even then, obsessing about messing up. Thank you for being such an inspiration.   We're going to have to agree to disagree about Prismacolors and Crayola colored pencils, though. I found some old Crayolas, and decided to give them a whirl, only to discover they were practically unsharpenable due to all the knots in the wood casing. I have to concede that the color cores are good for the price, but what good is that if you keep breaking the cores trying to sharpen them? (Sorry for OT rant; I'm just really passionate about wood quality!)   ;-D
That’s actually really good !!
You're a really good artist
How about drawing something you hate? Not something your bad at, but something your not really coomfortable drawing
this is absolutely amazing!!! and for you to say you can’t do half the things you just did; that’s inCREDIBLE!!!!! i’m so proud of you, keep up the good work! 👑👑
Don't play Rae, you killed this.
I have widows peaks and Im insecure abt it cause i feel like my 4head is weird
Anyone else getting Nico Di Angelo vibes? No?.....just me?.....ok
I dont understand how you did this so well. It cannot be your first go. Shes so pretty
Rae making me feel less insecure abt my widows peak 🙈
All of it is so relatable
AHH I LOVE 🤩🤩🤩
"if you can draw hands your wizard"                       IM A WIZARD
so are we just gonna ignore what she did to her hair? 😳    honestly it looks like she dyed it blindfolded in the dark wth
Rae:I cant draw hands Also Rae:*draws a perfect hand*
if you're bad at lineart then what does that make me
i went to the function of beauty website and did the quiz it ended u being $45 so I sady did not buy it but i really did cuz of color and the personal name i put on it >^<
She looks like starfire and raven Combined
I have the exact same art box and I love it
Who else is confused about rae's blond part of hair
OMG WE HAVE THE SAME HEADPHONES😲😲😲🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍
This is why I don't like the art community. Every time someone shows a drawing there is comments like: He/She could have done this, could have done that... -_- Shut the F up already JEEZ SOOO ANNOYING
good at everything but the hair
super super right ma'am!!! hands are like the most hard thing to do!!!
I remember when I was in high school, I went to a vocational that taught about printing on a press, graphic design, t-shirt printing, and etc. There was one time where I needed to cut something (like a piece of paper or vinyl with an box cutter. My hand was the most shakiest hand out of everyone there and I was the more artistic kid of the group. My teacher would jokingly tease with me as I tried cutting the vinyl in a straight line EVEN with a ruler. And I would still make a crocked line. I feel yah Rae! We are the shaky hand people!!
...how
she make you feel sorry for here, wanting your praze
I live how you draw everything you suck at and then it looks amazing
Me who does only comic styles and cartoon styles: o_O also I SUCK realisism ok
I love it when you make these videos Rae! It’s so much fun to see!
When somebody says  "I am terrible at this"  And then draws it perfectly 😂😂😂 (Ps nudge to rae😂😂)
Krazy Art crayon drawings
RAE dizzle.. can you draw someone from BTS... Plssssss💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Amazing job I love it light pad are great handling tool for art
I suck at drawing noses and eyelashes, I used to not have a hard time with noses at all.
I love your OC!
My friend and I with our incredibly shaky hands also going art 👁👄👁, our lines: —~_|\~——
great video ! but it would be nice to credit / link the music creators or songs that you use, such as which song is at 9:09 ?
I really liked how you framed this video as well as the OC you created. I created a “current situation” OC back a few months ago and had a tiny background story that I put to it. I think our characters could totally be members of the same dimension or storyline. If you are ever bored I’d love it if you checked it out. Anyway thank you for another entertaining and educational video. ❤️
But COULD the sponsor be Bowie?!
Can u draw v from bts?
Omg your in trending woohoo🥰🥰❤
Did anybody noticed all females in this series have blue hair
K GURL YOU DONT SUCK AT DRAWING ................... i suck more at drawing :)        'pure support' :)

This was fun ❤️😮
Rae you are awsome in drawing I love your drawings 😚😚🙂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 you are the best artist
Omg! So cool! Rae, you are really talented.
Function of beauty RUINED MY HAIR! It dried it, irritated  my scalp (which after 6 months is still irritated), gave me frizz which a NEVER get. Gave me a headache and made my hair FALL OUT!
I just wanted to let y’all know that I got small bald patches around my hairline after using Function of Beauty, while specifying in my formula that I wanted something promoting hair growth.  Of course it could be a coincidence, but I’ve seen more people with this issue after doing some digging and nothing changed for me stress or medical wise.   So please do some of your own research and use your own best judgement!
When will forensic fridays commence
“I’m concentrating so hard I just forgot to breathe” why is that such a mood
As I’m watching this I’m getting ideas for a drawing I don’t get how she is so good at things she’s bad at 😂 her art is always so beautiful and I hope to draw like her one day
The fact that I fell on love on drawing hands now, but I still S U C K
The drawing she did has hammon from jojo bizzare adventure
Your neon nails complement that blue table 🙌
Gah I love these videos
Sooo good drawing awesome❤❤
I REALLY LOVE THIS RAE! kickass
How distracting are her nails?
When Rae says: I suckk at this  and makes 1000 times better than you thought 😶😶😶
The woman looks like she came from a tv or something
You forget to breathe? I forget to eat and drink on a Dailey basis. Sometimes I forgot to eat/drink entirely.
everything she says-- draws 2 things
No hate she kinda looks like wonder woman but different powers and colors
Is functionofbeauty for men
I'm loving this new hair.
I’m good at hands when they’re not on people... if I’m drawing them without a person it’s way easier
This is really good😊😊😊
She looked like korra from avatar the legends of korra
U r making her live in present time
for the first one, I literally guessed hands
2:50 haha skip the sponsor if you want
When the things she sucks at are better than the things u r good at🤦😂

That is actually really good. I think Jazza would be proud of you.
Is it bad that the first think that I thought of was Nico Di Angelo
my sketchbook is filled with hands i loveee drawing hands
Rae you didn't bleach the daylight out of your hair you bleached the daylight INTO your hair!
I don't know why but her dog is so adorable 😍😍😍😍 I love her drawings also but her dog uhhhhhh 😘
Where's my medication?!!
this should be called drawing the thing she "thinks" she sucks at        its literally notbd🤧🥺
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MY FINE LINER. A tip: you may need to do short strokes when lining if your hands are shaky
...I think everyone has struggled with hands
Finelining tip that works for me: Make quick motions in small sections. This makes my lines much smoother, but you have to get comfortable with being able to stick closely to your sketch and being able to connect your lines together without leaving ink blobs and such.
what i struggle at drawing  -HANDS -on paper (cuz my hand shaky) -realistic -weird angles  What i usually draw -animeish artstyle -hybrids (cat+human) -on my phone -cell shading -blush
I love drawing hands! I used to draw them instead of my assignments because my teacher wanted me to draw my face all the time and I hated it so I ended up getting really good at hands. Now it's one of the main things I focus on teaching, that and faces.
I literally always draw a widows peak or something alluding to one, because I think flat hairlines are kinda ugly in art (my style at least, but I’m gonna work at that)
That's why in high school I went through a hardcore drawing hands phase so at least I'm good at one thing.
I kinda just bust out hands in scribbles and work from there and they work perfectly fine😂😂
The character looks like Starfire and the pink girl from power puff girls+ in Ravens style from teen titans go
I would love for Bowie to sponsor my    Videos lol
I loved function of beauty, but I'm allergic to it :(
yellow over cyan, love it
i love functuon
I might have the same fine liner pack that you used
rae, did you also switch to chrome since the google app keeps crashing?
OMG I HAVE THE SAME LED PENCILES AS YOU I got mine at five enbelow and there so cute that's very cool that we have the same pencils love ya❤️
These are literally all the things I suck at drawing!😭😂
What's the song in the background?
🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️🤍🤍❤️🥺🥺🌹
I fond a way to draw hands Easily
Can I just say....Rae’s headphones are so pretty I know this is random
Title: drawing thing’s I’m bad at  Rae: *nailing everything she drawing*
She lowkey reminds me of ember from Danny phantom lol
I dont think there are any lefties who can draw a straight line
I’m SO stupid I edited a comment that Rae liked and the like disappeared I’m CRYING 😭
Can i get it as a tattoo?
Your hands look better than when I drew mine in art I'm not artistic I wish I was unless you consider writing books artistic
WOAH girl you have a better hand then me i starts drawing and i mess up like right there and then. Then I get super mad cause i forgot i had a light broad...
At 14:14 what this song called and the artist name please and thanks for being a great person:) btw I love your channel:)
8:34  I can relate to the a lot 🤪
I don’t know how you do it Rae but you somehow manage to create something amazing I bet even if you tried to create something bad it would turn out amazing 🖌
I can draw h a n d s
With the fine liner, loosen your grip a bit and hold it a little farther back on the barrel of the pen. It will force your hand to relax a bit :) will feel uncomfortable at first:)
I changed literally 3/4 of an inch on my painting today (making a background curve straighter) and it fixed 90% of the whole piece's issues.  I was ... amazed.
omg as soon as i saw your hand i realised that my right hand has the same print then yours
Yes
has anyone told you that you look exactly like @taylorfeltmusic
I can draw hands on their own. Everyone to seen my hands drawint are jelly of me 🤣😅
its an awesome drawing, i am really bad at stepping out of my comfort zone. So seeing u do it is really cool.
I hated drawing hands foor years but I eventually wanted to learn so I followed a YouTube video by Anne castro aand it was so amazing I am now so comftorable drawing hands I really suggest watching her video!! Loved the video rae!!
"Bad at" suuuuuure, lolz😂
Well Rae, I find you to be a very brave individual and amazing artist! I wish all of my learning experiences had been as successful as yours appear to be in this video! I think it’s an amazing job and I think you should do more like this, this style seems to suit you quite well.  I look forward to watching more of your art journey. Please take care and be safe!
Learning about what I'm bad at always help to improve it to the best.   VERY GOOD SHARE RAE😘
I have a widows peek
Hey, Rae!  3 weeks ago on your 2nd channel you did a Five Below art haul, and I looked on the website, and there was oil paint, and oil paint is your gig, sooooooo..... What I’m trying to say is, can you do a paint and review of it on your main channel? Thanks!
I like the switch!
Am a wizard! Yay Ravenclaw am coming
me seeing the first thing you suck at:and this is why I never draw humans
I love drawing hands, their easy for me 0_0 but I don't think I'm a wizard... If so where my Hogwarts letter
I’d like to say i am pretty good at drawing hands..
function of beauty is garbage ♥
Sorry I’m late Rae!
Foreshortening is so hard for me lol I cant think of a 2d piece as 3d naturally. My brain naturally tries to 3D pen kt and pull it off the paper 😭
I must be a wizard as my art teacher said that my hands were some of the best drawn he had ever seen a student do and i am terrible at realism so that is something I guess I should be proud of
Oooo I'm digging the new blue table☺
nice job rae!!!
100% vegan        Ima eat it im vegan
...I’m really good at drawing hands  But proportions are freaking ANNOYING
I swear that u and chloe rose art gets the same sponsors
am i the only whone or am i noticing that rae is left handen 🤔🤷‍♂️
Hey you should do some Halloween comic painting👁👄👁
" i keep forgetting to breath" - Rae 2020
Ah yes, it's time to make fanart of Rae's OC!!
You had to put and in her eyes this perfect light yellow! Btw i loved this drawing!!!!
Hands, pshh, feet or shoes are hard
That 3 mins promo :D
Love the blue desk! 🦋💙💤
I have lots of characters with widdows peaks
I also love creating characters and designing them
I like drawing hands
Gurl you should do more OC stuff cause that looks so good not many ppl don fantasy stuff so you would be a great person too change that
"I forget to breathe" -Rae, August/12/2020
I literally rewatched the previous ones 3 times and today is the third then this came out
The ending song made me think of Michelle’s intro. (My thoughts will probably offend you)
Your nails are looking bomb
Ok Those little green thingies give me Dark Mark vibes
Well... I could use a spa massage right now, over 6 months in the home office...
That's our Rae. Always forgetting the outro. Lol great job btw.
That blonde in your hair looks so good and your hair be looking so shiny and smooth!
rae: "I think it's more normal for people to struggle with this than not struggle with this"  me: *glances at the wooden hand model I just bought*  rae: "hands."
you should do drawing with your non dominant hand
is it me, or does the drawing look like a mix between styles of zhc and Jazza?
I can't even draw a straight line
You really can't draw.
This comment is may silly but can you make a animal crossing video?!
She forgot the collar bones.
Me with an widows peak: every human I draw had a widows peak. Lol
Why would you take on a hair care sponsor when you're an art channel? It makes you seem hungry for money when you recommend a product to your loyal followers something that you're not qualified to recommend. You'd be more trustworthy if you accepted sponsors that are specifically for artists.
WE STAN AN IMPROVING QUEEN 👏👏👏
Said here first: I am a wizard 🧙🏻🖐
Wow LOVE the blue desk Rae!
I share the same strugle
My name is Dua and I love your videos your the one who inspired me to do art and I love it  so much thank you 😘😘😘💕💕
Ok can we just mention her AMAZING hairrr💕💕💕💕
early! kinda.....not really lol
Its so weird she was sponsored by function of beauty and Cloe was sponsored by function of beauty and they both posted today??😕😮
Youre so right rae!!!!💞💞💞💞     You cant draw.
I through She said things that she is bad at. GIRL  that was the best draw I have ever seen in my entire life ! 🤩
Yall need to watch Jess Karp She drew 100 hands
Omg your hair looks amazing!
i hope there's a horse in there thrown in for good measure
This was awesome, a couple of tips that may help... 1. If you are using a light box secure the base and top papers to it using washi tape, it will hold your art in place and avoid the dreaded slip. 2. There's a site called croquis cafe. Com  (you want the model index) that has a huge mass of models of different shapes and sizes in different poses, please note its for life drawing so they are in their birthday's units for the most part) it's awesome for seeing how the body looks in different angles and isn't as generic as some apps can be, they also do live drawing sessions with times poses on vinmo. It's all free unless you fancy supporting them with a donation. I highly recommend them. (you can find some of their images on Instagram but they are censored). My final tip is 3. Look on secondhand book shops for artist reference books or  photography and fashion books. I use awesomebooks. Com which ships worldwide, you can find some really good references for practicing and if you own the book you can use it to trace onto a scrap piece of copy paper your starting shapes. If you own a tablet and spot a image you want to use personally or adapt into your artwork screenshot it then load it into a drawing app and trace the shapes using that. This will give you a bit more confidence when it comes to drawing your figure. I recommend old books as they cost approx £3 each approx $4. And are delivered straight to your door for a tiny fee. (awesomebooks delivers free in the uk and very low rate to other countries). I have built up a huge reference from animals, plants, fashion, shoes, antiques, architecture. Yoga poses (which are great for pushing your anatomy drawing!) .. For not a lot of money I hope these may help someone, the most important thing is though that if your drawing outside of your comfort zone is never to be harsh on yourself, if its not looking right look closer where its good and isolate the mistakes and be proud of your achievements so far, by doing this you can narrow down your weaknesses and work on them. Never see your art as a failure only as a step forwards to creating something amazing.  Rae should you read this thank you for being your truly fabulous self, and for sharing your art and passion with us, keep safe and well x
Sooo. About that shaky hand... Same
9:22 Rae discovers my secret to good drawings by tracing
Knowing that Rae can't draw stuff I'm sorry Rae this isn't hate but honestly it's motivation in itself cause she's like an art gawd
I love both channels you make me improve on my art
OUT OF 1 YEAR OF WATCHING HER I JUST REALIZED THAT SHE IS LEFT HANDED
Bro rae u should make this girl a sticker it looks mad cool-
the character looks so cool! I'm looking forward for you to make more comic style characters
"inhales" ARTBLOCK
Rae's tombstone :  Cause of death: forgot to breathe
Oh hey, I have those fineliners! They were half-off at Hobby Lobby
Rae I drew u on tiktok @thechicken_queen
I love how Rae and Chloe have the same sponsorships and have the same personality and have the same brilliant content 😃
I love these videos! They inspire me to draw the things I'm bad at. Also, part 2 of this video is what made me find your channel :)
It really irks me that you just plonk a small drawing in the middle of a massive piece of paper, could do so many drawing, i love you tho!
Sadly I have a widows peak. And when combing your hair down. Everything is not symmetrical!
11:35 OMGGG SHEGO!!!! SHE WAS MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER!! (Yes i know - my fave character was a villan - but I still loved her)
You say your not that good at them even tho I disagree YOUR AMAZING 😍🤩
I am so mind blown by how seamlessly Rae conquered the things she believes she’s bad at but she draws them so well that it’s not even close to being bad
I  took the quiz for function of beauty, but im too brokw to buy it .w.
It looks good!
Hands are pretty easy for me sometimes
Anyone else plays gw2 ??
Rae I think your drawing was soooooooooooooooooooooooooo beautiful and amazing and wonderful and I don't know how you are suck at these things as your drawing turned to be amazing at the end
Bruh she drew the pose almost perfect! I've been practicing poses for like a year now and I could never get it good!! Rae you're an art goddess!!!
Hi
To whoever wants to be the next to comment "oh my god this is so much better than me I'm the worst" esque comments, please stop putting yourselves down :(
Rae you need to see this https://youtu.be/yPUsWB3x2A0
Notice how when Rae goes out her comfort zone the drawing or illustration look amazing
We're literally the same im horrible at all of em i tried so hard ro things like those, but yet again i fail
Things I’m bad at/but I’m really awesome at
Ive never struggled with hands 😂
Ma'am I like this video 😍😍😍 Love you Ma'am from India ❤❤❤
So uh I just saw a random video on insta about someone painting with candle wax....that would be an interesting video considering Rae always had a candle burning
I want to do something like this in my channel but I think I'd have way to many things to draw. 😂😂
Do a sketchbook tour, please
Rae: trying to improve her art Me: drawing Spongebob memes
Good job 👍👏
Your nails are always so pretty!!
👌
I cant draw realism
I just found your channel and by seeing the things that "you can't draw", I am definitely subscribing to see the things that YOU CAN draw!
Everything that rea is drawing zhc does it like comic book art , own character everything ... And the drawing that she did is amazing.!!!!💗 Lysm 💗
“I think widow’s peaks are so cool.”  *thank you*
Hiiiiiiiii
Ahh nothing to lower my self esteem more than rae drawing something she's "terrible" at and it being the most beautiful thing ever 🥰😔
I recommend you practise and study the things you are not good at, just drawing them once will get you nowhere^^"
Before she coloured, the character looked like a love child of Starfire and Artemis of Bana-Mighdall
Hands were the first thing at got right, it’s as easy as eyes for me
Your left handed ayyyyyy left handed people !!!!! 💕
Rae: she’s like, raising the dead in a sports bra Movies: yes she is  P.s. Thanks for making a muscular, badass lady
Ok but is the artwork in the back hwasa or Rae?
Early??
You have to do giveaways!!! I love giveaways from good channels!
Is it just me or has Rae changed? She has one of my favorite art YouTube's for years but I feel like her videos aren't the same as they used to be, but not in a good way. I know people change, but Idk if I'm gonna keep watching her...
You have to believe me! First I saw your videos and liked your channel....later I subscribed to it.....and finally after 4 days I turned the Bell notifications on! What a channel!
Pin this comment for no reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Binod
But its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
WOWO🤩
i can decently draw hands
She reminds me of the og starfire
The middle finger tho i cant😂
4:30 I'M GOING TO INSTALL THIS RIGHT THIS INSTANT TYSM RAE
I thought this was part 2
Rae: I don't see widow's peaks often! They're so awesome! Vegeta: What are you looking at?
Lol I use 3D magic poser’,  you can also kinda foreshorten stuff by changing perspective their too
Lol, she spends 3mins talking about function of beauty
It me 2 years to master drawing hands from mind
Rae, I gotta say: I'm proud of you! I can see you tried really hard and it turned out great!! I would love to see more of this!
You can tell Rae has been putting in work! I see you girl improving soooooo much! Im so happy and proud to see you grow as an artist
Rae we love you ❤️
#have no subscribers so far :(
Rae is just amazing ❤️
If I did this I would be drawing everything 👁👄👁✌️
Rae, we STANNNNNN
It turned out so cute, I love her :DD
Amazing 😍🤩 pls do make some more characters and make there realisum drawings. Love your hard word 👍
Living for the Wii music
Her drawing looks like herself U know like that Insta pic where she is in a ponytail And a t shirt  So cuttee
You made it really beautiful... I don't think you really suck at all the things you mention because it came out so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️💕💕  You are best at all these things you have mentioned ❤️❤️
She's looking like an original she-ra villain
Does anybody just click on Rae’s channel, waiting for a new video to pop up? ❤️
Rae : I have a couple of things I 'suck' at drawing soo let's do it   me : I don't have enough time in my hands to draw everything that exists...
the character Rae drew must b real so the Karens will wear their masks
I’ve been wanting to order that shampoo for so long. So thank you :)❤️
When Rae drawing everything she "sucks" at is still better than your own "good" drawing: 👁💧👄💧👁
I am 10 and I have 7 OC ,you should Also make more OC ,I dont know how about i strugle really unoften with the hands
Omg, her nails are on fleek
The things she's bad at are the things that I can't even do
My boyfriend has a cute little widows peak ♥️ although it can be hard to see under his big floof of curly hair.
Inspiring me to start drawing again
That shampoo would be perfect, if it wouldn't bee in a plastic container.
Who just noticed she is left handed!
Love your hair looks like Noyas! ❤️
Raeee what magic do you have on your hands
She kinda reminds me of raven bc of the colors of her clothes
That should be a TickTock song
Your so good at drawing! 😲 Also I have a widows peek and I hate it but I'm glad u think it's cool!
I luv how her hair looks soo crazy cool
You seem sadder
its so cool to see this for me, bc these are the things im GOOD at, but in contrast im super terrible at the things you normally do :D
Am I the only one thinking  I'd totally wear that on a shirt
Literally, my shaky hand is becoming part of my style
Your nails are so pretty
She never gets boring👌🏻
Is it just me or does the video look different from her others idk why
13:21 she may have accidentally flipped us off 😂 it’s ok I did on my birthday photo sometimes it just happens when you are pointing or holding something 😝
Imagine Rae saying instead of subscribe she said... SUBSCRIBBLE LOL I think I’m going crazy!! (Btw I really love your channel Rae :) )
Would you mind if I drew her? (With proper credit of course) she looks so good 💖💖💖 you've improved so much since the first part of this series keep up the great work! Ilysm❤
Lol i have funtion
I love drawing hands and legs ^^  It's my favorite part to draw in my piece other than clothes.
I always draw my non-fringed characters with widows peaks because i have one and always used myself as a reference. Lol I find it awkward trying to draw someone without. Also, I'm gonna need function of beauty to come back with the black formula again. IT'S SPOOKY SEASON SOON AND I NEED SPOOKY SHAMPOO
You should make that a sticker
_Me:sees video_ _Also Me:Thinks it is an old video_              1 hour later *Me:goes through subscription* *Also Me:REALISES IT'S PART THREE*  And that is how I am 1 hour late😊
Yessssss. I need more OC scenes
the music that she used when she was colouring her OC, it gave me Moriah Elizabeth vibes
Video idea-You can make a Bullet journal book .(I am being dying to see it) Chloe has also done it
Rae: *posts* Me: drops everything and clicks
I'm waiting for Chloe to comment she has the same sponsor lol 💅
Rae: DRAWING EVERYTHING I SUCK AT Me: what shud I draw?.... cats...
The thing I am bad in art is doing a baseline andCOLORING, that is blended and you uploaded a video on my B-Day thx
Plot twist: she isn’t bad at drawing anything ( this is confusing me- )
I'm very impressed with your first OC, because last time I checked making your very first OC is usually like uhhhhhhh *war flashbacks to horrific character designs I made as a child*
Love your vids
Your not bad at drawing anything!! I can barely draw an eye!!
I'm pretty good at hands I guess but drawing the other eye is a major problem for me
Rae's bad drawings are not even my good drawings lol 😂   ***btw I am a very small YouTube***
I suck at everything as she does exept fine lining
Those type of game characters usually have purple or black / red power
I clicked so fast because I couldn’t understand how rae couldn’t be good at drawing something
This is my favorite so far
Widow's peek I just called them McDonald's hair line
Here before her character becomes famous
this is sick!!! ...... you should draw a full team of characters for the raevolution x
Ur great at drawing everything 😂😂
The stuff is expensive though I did everything and it was £30.12 only for the conditioner and shampoo
T~T
Now I reallyyyyy want to draw        because when you draw I love to draw 🙂🙂     I love watching your videos and draw while drinking green tea 🍵 I love you sooooo much , girl 😽😽
duuuude, i loooove her hair and her nails so freaking much!!
THAT WAS SO GOOD omgg rae legendary
Me: not wearing ponytails cuz I have a widows peak Her: let’s give her a widows peak and a ponytail
Rae : I never ever make original characters  *Me looking at my intense pile of OCs* Yeah me too-
Tips on how to draw hands: do basic shapes instead of maming a big block do basic shapes  For example: created a a square for the palm and rectangles for the fingers Before you do the lines of the hands do the out line for the hand and then add the lines and then the shadow
Rae: I'm struggling right now.. I can't make this.. Me: 🤯 I can't even draw that which u can't make!!
Rae: you know when they have their eyes glow up?  Me: soooo, Avatar state
I can't even draw like you........... You're just perfect👌👌
:0
Rae: I have the worlds shakiest hands          Me: I feel you...
If you see this hi
I have never missed a Rae video everr and I can't say that for any other youtuber.
Pls make a tutorial pls I beg uuuu
Hands can be easy to do when you practice enough. You don’t even have to do a sketch of it and just go straight to lineart when you’ve ‘mastered’ hands. You can use references, tips and tricks, etc. It takes months or years to ‘master’ hands. You can learn the fundamentals first and then go to the icing on the cake! For any artists out there who ‘suck’ at drawings hands, you can do it!
You have the exact same light pad as I do except it's bigger.
Rae: drawing everything I am bad at      Me: ahh how can't she draw that     Also me: can't draw anything
Your thumbnail looked like a 5 minute craft video lol 🤣
I ave been waiting for this video for ages
I love u so much rae You are so creative  Please reply 🙏
That looks so badass
I really focusing on her nails than the drawings😀
Is it just me or at the time stamps 5:17 I thought Karen running up to somebody telling them to stop?
Seriously I think you and me have a different definition of being terrible at something 🤣
RAE :let’s get this party started Just then my iPad died 😫😩
Woooooow you told you suck ate it but you did amaaaazing
Damn that is freaking good holy shit that is amazing
Hands are the only thing I can draw lol
Love how she says she is terrible at these things when I can barely draw a stick man
Hi Mortal kombat Ember Mclain :) You can't unsee it but you can dislike this comment.
Honestly you can tell how much Rae has improved since the last video in her series!! It’s amazing. I adore the choices you made , and where i’d have said to go back and blend in a little more with the yellow, you’ve grown a lot, Rae !! Even if you never draw it.  Also hope to see this character more often. She reminds me of an 80’s super hero/villain
Hey I am not a wizard 🧙‍♂️ and I am a girl 😐🥺
‘I’m concentrating so hard I just forgot to breathe’. That is definitely me
I love this style. You should make more of this
Superraedizzle Weird side of Rae Superraedizzle Weird side of Rae Superraedizzle Weird side of Rae
Woof moo ribbit
One of the first to view this is the best
I still don't get why it's hard to draw hands for people because I have no problem
Hey
Like if you’re a hand wizard
Oooooooooo rae got a new chairrr!!
Jazza has a nice tutorial on hands! :D
Bro Rae it looks greaaaaat!!😤💕💕💕
Yo, I haven't seen any comments about this yet but that piece of art SLAPS!!! Well done Rae!
When i see thumbnail i thought it was drawingwiffwaffles video
It’s funny that you can’t draw original faces, because I can’t draw (and also loathe drawing) real ones
I 5ink hands are easy to draw (and fun!) but I can’t draw feet.
We want a video where you paint a landscape with *acrylic paint*
Wow your hair looks so good! It looks like hair from a Pantene commercial. 💇🏻‍♀️
Yesss I’m early! Love you Rae 😍
you did amazing! good job! I noticed you were holding the markers like a paintbrush~ this is interesting way of doing that~
Her matte nails are so beautiful 😍! How pretty, they look so yellow and matte that it’s satisfying.
😍😍😍
I love your videos you are so amazing and you inspire me every single day
I've actually never struggled to draw hands.  I struggle to draw my own damn foot. Feet are in my opinion harder to draw than hands.
I love how Rae says she’s about to draw things she’s “terrible” at drawing and then draws them perfectly
I see your hands and I raise you to... feet
My grandpa was a wizard he drew the best hands I’ve ever seennnnnnnnnnnnnn
This look sooo cool 🥺❤️
Guys...like this comment cuz....IM ONE HOUR LATEE :((((((
RAE THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE THIS!
Like this kind of drawing style :-)
finelining is hard but thats my favorite part .....it makes the drawing complete
that looks so good!!
Your so good don’t say drawing things I’m bad at
Oh god, I'm sooo early, hey Rae if u r seeing this i really like ur videos soo much u have been inspiring me for so long! ❤❤😊
Oh my god I love this. Ive been havin artblock and you just gave me motivation to draw. I love your work. Great job.
Your nails 😍
I'm very proud of people who can do hands and foreshortening. Its so super hard. I tried it my self and I cancel it everytime. 💔
notice meh 😂🤣😅
I’m really bad at drawing people, I’m working on face details right now, and I’m hoping that I improve with it!
Damn
It is such a rae thing to forget to film an outro !😂
Omg u look so beautiful
Did anyone else notice that rae is using the pencils from her 5-below video. (I've subscribed)
You have successfully created a wonderful and cool oc... I'd like to see more of her please 😂😂😂😂
When i saw this vid i thought it was one of your old vids but then i saw ur second channel and i clicked in under 1 sec LOL
👀 Sindel, is that you? She reminds me so much of Sindel from Mortal Kambat on Nintendo 64 😅 it's mostly the hair, though.
i luv u and your channel :):) (sry i  cant put emoji in this laptop)
I’ve never been so proud
Hands the thorn in every artists existence no matter what you will fail at hands at least one time
1:41  Bowie looks surprised at us

Tips for hand drawing- draw a box a fries and round everything to look like hands
I use magic poser to!
b l u e
That looks awsome
(0% chance of rae seeing this)  I have a witch character with a widows peak!
I was casually browsing on YouTube while doing homework and when I saw u r new video I told my parents I was done with my work as an excuse to watch ur video!
This is your first time!!! I mean its SO GOOD
Hey Rae. Where’s the link to the foreshortening app? I tried looking for it on the app store but none of them looked like this one, and they were very low rated.
What's her name??
Don’t worry, I can’t even draw an Apple
You are seriously my favorite artist on YouTube I always look forward to your videos ❤️
You make my day even better and don't worry I suck at that too.
drawing hands are difficult.. i always used to find sneaky ways to crop out the hands...but during the quarantine i followed some tutorials..and practiced for a month ...and trust me all my painings look like indian goddessed(most of them have more than 2hands ...but not in a creepy way)...🤣drawing hands are addictive af
You are good at drawing everything Rae!!!!!
Love ur vids such an inspiration
17K VIEWS IN 56 MINS JESUS CHRIST

KAGWIE its amazing 😳😳
Hi
That came out so cool
Rae has such great video ideas!
Rae: Drawing things which I terribly draw...  Me: Rae cannot be terrible at anything, specially drawing.. 💖
Make   A video about your dog
Me: drawing a man sitting on a car pointing at any animal 😅
How did she do that the hands
I think the looks good
Rae's background for filming looks so aesthetic!
Early
YAy I am early
When her worse drawing is freaking good next to your good drawing _huf huf_
How thoughtful of you to add a face mask 💜
Ok so nobody's gonna talk about her BOOTFIFUL BRIGHT NEON GREEN NAILS, u can pull of any nail colour dude
What's wong with the table
I know noone will see this but Super rae dizzle has the best ideas i swear          I am tryna each 500 you dont have to care tho have a great day!!!
I have been waiting SO long for another one of these videos ❤️
Omg this artwork turned out soooo good! And this is like everything you think your bad at, like I don't rellay believe you when I see this artwork 😍😍😍😍
I STAN with you girl I love this type of stuff seeing you pushing yourself because it inspires me SO much.
I clicked the vid even tho I was studying 🤣
Rae wont like cos I'm late
Early :D (kinda 😅)
Hands are soooo. Eaaaaaaasssyyyyyyy
YOU'RE BED IS LAVA!! 1 2 3 4 like if you didn't do anything.
Rae, your hair is so pretty!! <3
I want this to be turned into a comic series
im late :( hi rae
I can draw hands (kind of) but that’s because I use and iPad -3-
Soo we have everything here such as  Crayons  Colour pencils  Books  Wohh I have something to eat tho such as  Pizza  Burger  Sandwiches  Wedges  We have drinks too  Each costs one like 😁😜 ⬇️👍
If I did this video, it would be like 100 hours long because I would have to draw EVERYTHING 😳😂
Love you Rae! You really inspire me to chase my dream and thank you so much
U are  best at everything Rae!!!!!!!!!!( like if you agree) :)
I love art because the thought of people making a masterpiece from nothing is just beautiful
She - I suck at drawing hands  Me - me too  She - draws a  beautiful hand ✋ Me - 😑
I am so glad you’re sponsored get that coin girll✨💅😌
The stuff Rae considers 'bad' is the art I take pride and joy in 😭
Like that word you use DARN IT
What I'm good at drawing :                                       *Nothing....*
Id love for James raiz or an expert marvel illustrator to draw this interesting character
Does the queen like? 😌❤✌👸🏽
OMG YOUR DRAWING IS SO GOOD
Fun video, would be cool to see that character more
wowzers
I literally just woke up 😂😂
I would give up art if it weren’t for you
For a style you’re not used to this came out really awesome! I would love to see you experiment and come out of your comfort zone a little more. 😁
The one thing I would like to know is if Function of Beauty makes shampoo AND conditioner that deals with dandruff. I used Head and shoulders a lot but they stopped selling the dandruff conditioners, . I'm doing somewhat ok with just the shampoo, but I wouldn't mind a brand that can help with dandruff
I LOVE your nails!!!
YOUR HAIR LOOKS GORGEOUS
Honestly, I'm a very beginner at drawing and I find hands to be quite easy to draw. It's like the only thing I can draw right now. Faces though...I think anyone who can draw faces and facial features correctly and proptionally are fucking wizards.
If this was my vudeo it would prob be abt 0939392827262727272819193eowoeiwei|  hours long
Rae your so amazing
I love rae both channels its really good and she should do a colas with chloe rose art and imagine 9f she liked my comment
Out of topic ,but I love your hair Rae❤️ also Bowie is sooooooo cute 🐶
I LOVE bold skunky highlights on dark hair, you look incredible.  I'm also living for challenging yourself like this. You're doing amazing Rae. ❤
I believe that you may struggle with that kind of stuff, but you definitely don't suck at it lol you need to take more time, because is not something that you usually draw, but you don´t start at the bottom like most of us, maybe for previous studies or practice (in other kinds of drawings, but it reflects in everything else), I really looove your drawing <3
girl these 3d apps are not great 😭 use reference photos, they work so much better, and you should think about quantity rather than quality when you are practicing! sketch A LOT and don't think too much about making it perfect, you will improve so much really quickly!♡
THANK YOUUUU
This turned out so good?!!!
It's kinda hard to think Rae is terrible at drawing something
Me when rea posts heckk yassss sleep you can wait
This would be a great trading card!
I really love this concept and how you put it together. I like that you have improved in your drawings too! I am getting back into drawing as its a hobby that I miss doing! Keep it up!
A tip for the lightbox, dont use fineliner immediately, just transfer using a pencil and keep it light handed. Take the linework in small sections and connect them later, give yourself some breathing room
I'm soo early OMG I hope u someday reply to my comment Rae❤️
Sometimes I forget that not everyone has a ton of original characters. 😅
Bro uv never made an oc how do u live bro😳
Awesome !
I also suck at drawing hands 😒😒
I love all your art one of these videos   is what got to subscribe
Your oc really reminded me if stripperella at first for some reason
But I love Bowie!!! :( She's such a cutie and a sweetheart! A fat and lazy one, but still!
youre character is so good
I mean,the drawing was PRETTY good.🤩😉                                          Love ur videos!💓Ur the best!💓
Clicked so fast 😌💅💅💅
Rae i have a video idea for you can you paint mommay dizzle as mona Lisa plss i love your vids.💕
Can u please draw Billie Eilish in your next vid Rae
When you flipped through the comic books, was that John Romita Jr.’s art?
i love this seris but honestly  you may think you suck and had to have many attemps but i honestly think your amazing at least better than me
There was 666 comments before I commented 🙀😳
Yo I suck at hands to😭
Love the vibrancy amazing so very vibrant.... I'm getting very very very excited just for no reason
Just wondering wat fineliner did u use? Xx hope your well and staying safe
Rae :"its my first fantasy drawing" its amazing  Me: has drawn thousands  and they suck...
Rae posts  Everyone going straight to the comments
28 mins ago :O
this sponsor may actually be something I use -- I have very thick, very oily hair (thank my Sicilian roots for that) -- but also have part that is color treated since I have this pomf of dyed hair.  Its always a toss up between drying up everything, or making everything a lot slicker and heavier.   Thanks Rae!
i love u Rae!!!
You are my third favourite youtuber 2 . ZHC❤ 1. Moriah Elisabeth ❤
Rae:Comic book style! *anime game ad plays*
Half of the comments say "First"
U drew Ariana Grande lol
Wait what is her name???
HEY YOUTUBE SAID 26 SECONDS NOT MINUTES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😤😤😭😭😭😤😤😤😤😤😤😡😡😡😡😡
Ahh hands, the one thing that haunts every artist in the world
Sketchbook tours?
Omg girl you are so so talented i think you are the 👍best artist🎨🎭🙋 youtuber i have ever saw 🥰🤩🥳
i have a god damn obsession with drawing hands even though they're not perfect all the time, it's just like amazing
Rae:- Drawing stuff I'm terrible at...   Also her:- Draws a masterpiece :)   Meanwhile me:- Why was terrible there ?
Me : l am earl-  621 people  having ehrhvir cjv super duper WiFi : First check
My tips for drawing hands! Start out with a tapered box and then draw a oval where the thumb is. Normally I freehand this but roughly blocking in the fingers helps a whole bunch, then you can start slowly chipping away at it, also remember that the less detail in the hand the better
Any one else watching this on a lunch brake
she still looks like she's wearing a sports bra tho
Omg omg you watch Kim posibile yay
Posted 24 minutes ago Me: oh yay! I be one of the first people to like!   1.5k  Me:oop-
I'm ok at hands (can always improve, of course) - but I struggle with feet (and shoes).  Great work! Your character is great. =)
Wow looks awesome! Also I too play as necromancer lol. I made a D&D character as one too 😊
Fabulous Rae. I genuinely look forward to your videos.
Noone      Ray: always forget to film an outro
That annoying looks so good!!!! I could never!!
Even the things you say you're bad at you're still better at them than me
Yayyyyy!!!! I am so early 😄😄
Early ig
Is it just me or is there drugs in that shampoo and conditioner because she keeps sniffing it
How convenient I’m practicing anatomy, poses, feet, hands, and muscles and I suck at that but I gotta do it if I want to be a manga artist
its beautiful
I loveeeee the thumbnail 🤩
This is an amazing artist right here
I'm doing a piece with five hands that are HUGE, they are literally the size of my own hand because I have to use the most of my 24x30 inch canvas (its my first commission piece:))
You sure your bad at anything?
Do speed drawings with colour pencil
I can draw hands that theyAren’t the best
Nice video
You are the best 🌞😻
22 minutes lateee☹️
Hiiii Rae
Don't start sketch with face rather start ur sketch journey with hand sketch. And become master at hand sketch, surely the person who can draw hand, can draw anything. Hope everyone will get my small well advice. 😇
Dude I clicked so fast I dropped my phone when I was walking down my stairs-Lol love you Rae I’m a big fan 💕
Rae: drawing things I suck at drawing  Also Rae: drawing an apsolute master piece 🤯🤯  Me in the corner: you like my stick man 😟
Finally new video 😭😍😍
I dont really struggle with hands Well anime hands atleast
20 minutes. 581 comments.  Yayyyyy!!! You're the best!  To strangers: What? You are early? It's easy. I challenge you to be the...      ... *L A S T*
I can draw hands. Who else can draw hands
Hey! Sorry to bother you, but Function of Beauty can cause Hair Loss. There have been multiple people who tried it and it caused them to loose a lot of their hair. Just wanted to let you know!   I also really liked how you did on all the stuff! It's literally so pretty even though you "SUCK" at it.
Oop hello
This is how many people were here before the link was added 👇
This is how many people were here before the link was added 👇
Wow just wow and you say your BAD at this stuff psh A- jus- age-old whaaat???
Hiiiiiii
*me watching my mind* : boi that not hard but the hands tho yes  also whats that song you played by the end?
I'm 5 minutes in and I'm already jealous at her foreshortening drawing, It's so good TT~TT
I was kinda ranting or being salty in the last videos in terms of you not doing artwork, but that's why, even in thing you don't normally draw, you amaze and inspire me, please, continue with the good job.
The lightbox trick is SO SMART if you have trouble with lineart!
This is always so relatable
Hi Rae, are you going to make more episodes of this type? I find the idea is really interesting I'd love to see more
Video: things I'm terrible at  Also video: bad at hands  Me: *taKe a LoOk aT mY hAnd drAwINg*  (Jk Rae you have awesome videos!)
Rae I love you so much. you are amazing artist and this video inspired me the most I've seen all of your vids I love you!!!
Hahaha me tooo
I love this videos 😃
I filmed the exact same thing, but accidentally deleted the video, I- ;(
Wow I'm early!
i like how she says that she is bad at hands but she draws a hand in like 10 seconds i struggle with hands
You are sooo good at drawing I love it and I hope that someday I will be able to draw like you😁
if you enjoy playing video games or have a friend that does - I *highly* recommend using/borrowing them to help make an oc, for example - i had an idea for a kinda more western character for ages, and when i started rdo the other day the customisation stuff let me actually give him an appearance that i'm very fond of. skyrim, aion, and i feel like most rpg games can have some damn good customisation options, and certainly helps with designing characters - at least for me  like i said tho - use games you either already own or borrow them from a friend, don't just waste 70 bucks on a game to make an oc or two unless you reckon you'll actually enjoy playing the game lmao  there's also the more obvious choices like taking inspiration from music, places, etc. - but i like using games the most since you can build up your characters looks, personality traits, and the like super easy, and also i like playing video games so i can use character making as an excuse to play more of them
How just how's      Ur so cool
I think that all artists hate to draw hands 😪
You're so talented Rae! This artwork is stunning!! So creative!! ❤❤
Hi Rae!! I love ur videos so much! Ur videos inspired me so much to get into art! Love u so much💜
Fun fact: I actually got my function of beauty package today. I'm from Denmark, and usually there can be a lot of extra money that gets added to your order bc of shipping. There was absolutely no extra money added. I just paid for the order and the shipping. Very cool!!
Hi I Love you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH

EARLY!!! well, kind of.... Anyway rae you are amazing!
Rae:I'm going to draw everything I suck at drawing Her art:Way better than how my art would ever be Me:👁️👄👁️
I have those freaking struggles too. I even messed up with my original character I made for a network that our President shutdown, ABS-CBN. I need a referrence to make his pose. I have to repeatedly earse thwn draw the hands.
When I first watched the video 9 comments. When I refreshed it 500 COMMENTS!!!

Hi👋
🤩🤗🤩 amazing
Dear NOTIFICATIONS Why do you always notify me after 5 minutes
Hello Rae I am the biggest fan of yours I clicked this video as fast as I could
Rae: Drawing erverything I suck at Me: What do you suck at tho?
Hi Rae. I really like these types of videos where you draw things your not good at to get out of your comfort zone and improve. If you ever need a VIDEO SUGGESTION, maybe you could do good hand(left hand) vs bad hand(right hand art). You draw or paint a picture and you do two copies. One with left and one with right and see the difference.
I fricking Love your channel! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Rae! Can you do a video where you tell just what to practice?! Like everybody says practice to be better at drawing but what do we practice even? Where do we start?
it's the aggressive side part for me
Hi
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Love the nails!!❤
I would happily take rae's nail color in a highlighter
Never clicked too early
I really don't know if I would be able to face myself if I did this ! Superraedizzle thumbs up

Rae: I can not draw hands Also rae: draws a good hand
Uh Rae, you ahve a typo in the title. It should be '' Drawing everything Im awesome at drawing, because I can draw everything beautifully''
I like to buy products from Bowie tho..😶  Like hugs and kisses hehe UwU
I HATE drawing hands. One of the fingers always ends up fatter/thinner than the others.
So excited!😆❤
This series inspires me to get out of my comfort zone and draw stuff I’m afraid to or bad at drawing. Thank you Rae for making this series!

My finger said skrrt and I dont blame you. When I have to draw hands I draw the sleeve oversized. Or just add it in a pocket or something. ( I'm also watching and typing ) I've never done foreshortening soooo yeah. MAKING MY OWN CHARACTER YES. Fantasy Oc. I've also done sooo owo. I too am not good at fine lining that's why I got erasable pens XD
