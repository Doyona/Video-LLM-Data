3:00 you and mirabel having the same exact reaction is killing me😂😂😂
0:59 every pharmaceutical commercial when the “side effects include death” starts
I didn't know it was possible for me to appreciate this song even more, but somehow you made me with your explanations of what exactly the singer is doing
I LOVE this movie, I'm just seeing this. Thank you❤
*gasp* What happened to Bruno?   WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BRUNO! NO NO NO...
Do you now the mening of the movie dude i men the real mening Watch the movie and just try to see the press every one is under buddy you will cry Get angry and scared  well the clock is 23:27 and i wish you a goood nigth
Please react to epic the musical
There are no raccoons in this movie. Those are coati mundis.
Fun fact: Stephanie Beatriz, who voiced Mirabel, was initially considered to voice Luisa based on her deep-voiced Rose Diaz from Brooklyn-99 - until they found that her natural voice is way higher and lighter. Could you imaging this song sung by her?
This song hits so close to home for me, as an eldest sister wanting to protect my younger sisters when my mom went berserk and the divorce was a shit show.
oooh, thanks for surfacing the live performance, I didn't know that existed
Oh, No she doesn't stay in a range!  Low, controlled, high, soft, low and controlled.  Gives me goosebumps.  (and Okay, I'm the Big Sister)  I's appropriate the MOOD changes periodically.   And the dancing donkeys kill me. 👀👀👀👀 Bruno?  Oh, we don't talk about Bruno!!!!!  (next song)
Um, did anybody else notice the donkey's dancing and playing the violin?
"She's not gonna sing-" ":D" God the look of pure JOY on your face at that alone! Not only does she sing, but she has one of the BEST songs in the ENTIRE movie! For real her voice actress was phenomenal, we NEED more characters like Luisa! The casting in this movie was top-notch, and Jessica Darrow is the pinnacle. Truly, such an incredible performance!
the line about "under the surface, the ship doesn't serve as it heard how big the iceburg is" is my favorite line. not necessarily because of the lyrics themselves but the visuals as well. and that "under the surface" the iceburg is MUCH bigger than what is shown above the water. to the ship it looks small and if it was that small then the ship could just ram it and keep going but no one who is relying on that "unsinkable ship" has no idea that the problem is much bigger than even the ship knows.
I wonder what Luisa would think if she knew how much lesbians just love her. It’s like the dad from Inside Out.
Jessica Darrow is a national treasure and should be protected at all costs
I love how you included enough backstory to understand the song.  I wish you spent a bit more time on the lyrics but I learned a lot about the vocals.  Searching now for your Bruno take
Why does she dance so well?   Tío Félix isn't going to let any of his niece's dance badly. The second they could stand, he was on it like a bonnet.
She dances so well because they are showing how is Colombian people!
9:13 "Why does she dance so well?" BRO THATS AN ANIMATION
4:00 What happened dude T-T
9:15 “What the fuck?!” 😂😂😂😂 is killing me
"why does she dance so well?" Cuz shes Latina????? 😂😂😂
I also notice at the part where her and mirabel were on the clouds, about to be dropped by boulders which Luisa caught it.  You could hear the word "Pressure" getting repeated in the background, and increasing the volume until the boulder fell on Luisa. This indicates the pressure building up, not giving her anytime to rest or calm down, it'll just drop on her in an instant.
i cant keep focus you keep taking off and putting on your earbud every 10 seconds
My sister and I are so close and we had a grateful moment when we listened to this song together for the first time and every time I hear this song I wanna cry and I’m trying not to while I’m at work 😂😂😂
Low key, the donkeys were the real stars of the song
The hell is a twank
"Give it to your sister, your sisters stronger, see if she can hang on a little longer" bro 🥲  Fun fact, when she says "line up the dominoes, a light wind blows" there's a literal tornado coming towards her. She sees that as light wind because of how much she deals with on a regular basis
They did a live version and the singer sings exactly the same as the movie . Soo good
I love your videos you're my favorite vocal teacher
Fuck...you just say this song is fantastic over and over...like wtf, we already know it's good, you don't have to repeat it so many times☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️💩💩💩💩💩💩
Luisa givin' Mirabel that main quest for moving the storyline along smoothly.
"Big and Full and Thicc." - Tristan 2022
what bothers me so much and no one has mentioned is in the first chorus when she says "who am I if". when she says "I" it sounds really weird. like, badly layered or badly autotuned
Now you can watch her sing it on YouTube. Encanto under pressure at the Hollywood bowl
"This song is amazing! Dafuq?!  Gold comment right there
She's stuck in her childhood  room because her door disappeared...
sounds like a young male kid
She can sing! and the strong lady is named luisa she's voiced by jessica darrow surface pressure is sung by jessica darrow too.
"Why does she dance so well?" She is Colombian! Shakira? Hahaha  You should listen to it in Spanish. This song isn't as good in Spanish but all of the other songs really work well.
The singer/voice actor for this song is crazy talented. If the beginning hadn't been like a rap in conversation timing for the movie it would just be a straight bop if it was just a song. Almost the gifted kid anthem if it could've just been a song. Musicals do be like that sometimes
amazing
"Give it to your sister and never wonder, if the same pressure would've pulled you under"  Beautiful line.
you should react to some tangled the series songs!
Trauma is a bitch. I can't even watch this song without bawling my eyes out because I relate to it so much.
This was actually the only song in the movie that I liked. The others weren't bad but they were still mediocre and had no "re-listen" value imo (unpopular I know but that includes We Don't Talk About Bruno) where as this was sooooo deep, relatable, and impressive vocally and also very well placed in the movie. It just stood out more than the others and I have been listening to this song over and over again for hourss
5:56 “This song is amazing” Right!? I’m obsessed 😆
obsessed with how everyone says "donkey" in this movie
One if my favorite songs to sings because of the differences in the voice
Bro, you look like Antonthy Padilla WTF
Despite her iffy transition between the character voice and singing voice I still think this song is incredible
7:25 the "Am I" sounds kinda too much pitch shifted/tuned Is it just me? Anyway it is a Disney song so it is supposed to be perfect.
Ok I know you did this 6 months ago but I absolutely LOVE this video sooo much
@Tristan Paredes   watch this cover bro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOR2wqisJqQ&ab_channel=OurLastNight
She said a tornado was an light wind
After all of the supernatural stuff in the video you draw the line at her being a good dancer?
yeah!!!!!!!!!!!
Amanda Palmer's cover is amazing. This song actually sounds like it was written for her.
when I watched Encanto the first time I yelped "that was amazing!" at the end of this performance. I love this video because it's great to watch somebody else have the same excitement I had the first time I saw/heard it! I am now yelping at your video "YES THANK YOU" lol
I love how this vocalist uses the breaks in her voice and the transitions necessary for the notes to show character vulnerability. It's so good for the character, and it makes what you point out as very necessary vocal tricks seem like intentional character choices.
This is absolutely the most relatable Disney song ever. I freaking love this movie and I’m so happy my kids do too so I can listen to the music all the time 😂
thats where they stay until they get their powers and cuz she did not get a door she had to stay in there. did you not listen when she was talking to the little boy in that room????
don't swear
This song has a very kpop vibe to me. Both in the song and the dance. I love it!
So you really watch movies like that with your mouth open? Hamming it up for the camera is a bit ridiculous.  Reaction videos are so over done and low bar content especially for so called vocal coaches without credentials.
This is by far the best of these "vocal coach" videos. All the others I've seen just state the obvious "sing low, but now high!" whereas Tristan here actually comments about technique and the intricacies needed to pull this off
Go watch her sing it on YouTube with just a bass player. It’s all her. Her voice is amazing for this song.
I truly love this song, it’s brings tears to my eyes 🥺
Isnt this song amazing?!?
BTW.. We don’t talk about Bruno!
i can sing that song i am only 7
Despite the range I'm gonna sing a little lighter  I'm gonna own it and go a little higher
Unpopular opinion alert! I did not like this movie what so ever but Surface Pressure is an amazing song!
ok but on a side note the donkeys add so much excitement 🤣
Please do a review from American idol we don’t talk about Bruno
"just because you can life heavy rocks doesnt mean you can sing gurl" *looks shocked not 5 seconds later*
I really like your face looks like Mirabel Lmao at 3:00🤣🤣❣
When her body got big at the end and you were "What?!?!"   Are you too young to remember 90's Disney?  Almost all songs were these outrageous "other world" locations like that. Where size was all over the place.
Me who don't understand what he is saying about vocal runs
To hell with not taking about John Leguizamo, this is the star of the show.  Well....this and the one about the catapillers
Can you react to Just Sing from the Trolls: World Tour movie?
“Why does she dance so well” - answer, she’s Colombiana 🤣🤣🤣
Jessica Darrow is a boss. That’s all.
She sounds pitched down to me too, first thing I noticed
“Why does she dance so well?” Idk maybe cuz… they have a good animator??
Anyone else notice how he forgot to censor  the curze word at 9:16
my personal favorite Encanto song, for me this song is NOT metaphorical but literal as I do have anxiety myself and feel that I am worthless if I'm showing myself as 'worthy' or 'smart'
I honestly think this is one of the best Disney songs ever.
I haven't been able to find an answer to the same question, "I wonder of they're pitch-shifting her at the bottom," came here to find it. 😭
I love watching people getting impressed by this song
I haven’t heard a song with such great vocal transition since Jack’s lament. I’m no singer but i can tell this singer is such a pro
there is not a single god damn rat or racoon in the god damn jungle sir.
I don’t know anyone that doesn’t absolutely love this song
“Enchanto strong lady”
En lo profundo ♫ I really like this song in the English version
Tio Bruno, means “Uncle Bruno” in Spanish, their uncle had a vision
I really like how even in the lower range, with her throat more open, she still pushes out that *raw emotion* of the character and the singing is still *amazing* even with that tonal "setback." what should be a hinderance does absolutely nothing to stop Jessica and she not only pushes through and keep the voice (even in the high notes" reminiscent of the actual character's voice, but still makes sure that the sheer power behind each word is heard and felt.
I like his reaction when he growled😂😂😂
I would love to hear you react to Woodkid’s Guns for Hire from Arcane. It’s one of my favorite songs from the series. Actually, the whole series has the best playlist. I can’t wait to see what the second season brings. 💜💜
May God bless you and your family and help you Give your life to Jesus Christ and repent. I pray this in the mighty name of Jesus Christ I pray Amen.Jesus Christ loves you. Give your life to Jesus Christ and repent. He’s coming soon. Please pray and repent.
Her name is Jessica Darrow. That jazz version she does is incredible. She's also done a punk version (which I haven't heard yet).
You should listen to greek version .its amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Love seeing you react to this movie in real time, Tristan. It's so amazing. I love Surface Pressure. Jessica Darrow sings with such a tapestry of vocal colors in this song.  She is so talented.  My kids and I listen to this over and over. It's our favorite song from this movie.
I believe she had the best song. :)
at 3:00 tristan did the same reaction as mirabel hahahaha
Why does  encanto have the best songs ever
3:00
4:67
Mirabel's room is the nursery. When you look at it in the light, it has letters and things. It's meant to be temporary.  I think everyone started in the nursery (which is why everything is so old), and when they got their gift at age 5, they got their own room. Mirabel didn't get a gift, so she didn't end up leaving the nursery.
It's not fine her room is a damn nursery Lol
This song and Isabella's song are the best in Encanto in my opinion. The Bruno song is super fun to dance to.
Micky Mouse standing right outside of frame with a bat. 🤣
Surface Pressure is one of my favourites. I love it. I also hate that Mirabel not only didn't get a gift but didn't even get a room. Like come on Casita, you could have at least given her a room even if you had a reason to not give her a gift. What, now she has to keep sharing the nursery with each new generation that comes along?? Listening to other people's babies cry in the night? No way, man.
the strong girl natrually has a deep voice and plaed in other movie with singing she got the role to be mirabel shes so famous
9:14 got me deadd 😂😂😂
anyone else nodice that her voice gets more gental as she reveils herself and isabells voice gets stronger as she reveils herself
React to we don't talk about Bruno and when camilo transforms into Bruno you can see him how he looks but he's not 7 fot frame 😅
Personally I hate surface pressure. I love the lyrics just not the singer. It sounds like a girl trying to be a boy or a boy tryna sound like a girl. She just doesn't sound good to me.
I love the fact that the ice berg is Luis as pressure there's A little pressure on top but alot deep down
Sir...did I just hear...profanity.????
"This song is amazing, the f*ck." How I feel when someone hasn't heard it yet.
you're just repeating your words "this song is fantastic" you even know that...too many stops the video..can you watch it first, after the video runs out then you comment
she's the strong one, she's very nervous
Mirabel didn't get a magic room, so she stayed in the Nursery. If you look at the walls, it even has a cutesy alphabet along the walls, among other things.
One thing that’s interesting about this song is that you can break it up into four different sections – intro, verse, chorus, and bridge — each of which takes place in a totally different, mostly non-overlapping pitch range, and both the pitch ranges themselves and the tone that Jessica Darrow’s voice takes based on those ranges reinforces the meaning of each section.
I've listened to several covers of surface pressure, and nobody has been able to match the original, and I think it's mostly because of the emotion, and the vulnerability Luisa's VA was able to portray here.
3:07....are we going to forget Gaston song and this SONG IS SO GOOD
Its such a good song. Way better than bruno’s.
he missed the emotions
You can also see in the song, whenever Luisa notices Mirabel looking frightened, she shifts to a less scary theme (dancing with donkeys, etc).  She's always trying to protect her, even emotionally.
This is my favorite song in the entire movie, I like it more than I like We Don’t Talk About Bruno
I lost it at the "drip drip drip" part too lol when I first saw this movie I was like "this is a banger!!" I really love Luisa and this song! I actually felt really bad for her.
3:00 Thumbnail
My name is Tristan to haha
You know ever since i watched encanto for the first time i ended up repeatedly replaying their songs and this was the song that i've heard most
Her : no mistakes   Him : uooo mistakes  🤣
Did he purposely time his hand gesture with the bell?  😲😲
You’re awesome!
Oh my gosh I love encanto so much
I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is I move mountains, I move churches And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is I don't ask how hard the work is Got a rough indestructible surface Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanding But Under the surface I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus Under the surface Was Hercules ever like "Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"? Under the surface I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service A flaw or a crack The straw in the stack That breaks the camel's back What breaks the camel's back it's Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'till you just go pop, whoa Give it to your sister, your sister's older Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder Who am I if I can't run with the ball? If I fall to Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go, whoa Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger See if she can hang on a little longer Who am I if I can't carry it all? If I falter Under the surface I hide my nerves, and it worsens, I worry something is gonna hurt us Under the surface The ship doesn't swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is Under the surface I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this? Line up the dominoes A light wind blows You try to stop it tumbling But on and on it goes But wait If I could shake the crushing weight of expectations Would that free some room up for joy Or relaxation, or simple pleasure? Instead we measure this growing pressure Keeps growing, keep going 'Cause all we know is Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt And see if she can handle every family burden Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks No mistakes just Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go, whoa Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa Give it to your sister and never wonder If the same pressure would've pulled you under Who am I if I don't have what it takes? No cracks, no breaks No mistakes, no pressure
Are we all just going to ignore all the donkey's in the background? xD
Oh now we’re saying deep voices female voices can’t sing? 🙄
1:50 Her "room" is actually the nursery. When new family members are born, they live in the nursery until they're old enough to earn their miracle, at which point they get their own room. As I'm sure you know by now, Mirabel doesn't have her own miracle, therefore she didn't age out of the nursery and must live in there. That's why she knew where Antonio was because he was hiding in "their" room, the nursery.
@ REACT!!!!!!!
Wow!! 6:52
3:43 felt like you were about to hit the chorus of Still Don't Know My Name 😅
Plz watch the full  me
I subscribed to you because you googled her and I wanted to!
can you react to this fan song made by OR30 Called: Turn it down
Bruno at the background when you showed the encanto picture
Those aren't raccoons! :)  They're my favorite animal in the world!  COATI! COATIMUNDI!
You pointed out everything I wasn't a fan of with this otherwise amazing song. The voice was all over the place. I'm not a fan of singing in "Hurr Hurrrrrr," and the jump around to different voices was very jarring to me.
“Oh god please don’t” 😂😂😂 I’m subscribing just for that line alone
Love that you analyzed Louisa's voice more deeply than "she sounds tough" like most people do..... definitely gonna binge the rest of your reactions.
I don’t know why but for some reason you look like Chris Pérez to me, maybe it’s the hair hahah
6:58 kinda sissy noice
9:16 Best Part Of The Vid XD
Are you a doctor
They’re not raccoons, they’re coatimundis…..one of the great things about this movie is that all the animals are Colombian creatures….a Jaguar, coatimundis, toucans and tapirs. Oh and quit baggin on low voices…..twang is overrated……every singer has an upper and lower range. Prejudging her before she’s even one verse in is very unfair. And no she doesn’t sound like two different people at all, she sounds like one person singing her upper and lower register.
It'd be cool to see you react to some Steven Universe songs!
She actually talks that deep
Omg the face you made after the run, iconic 😂
I like the message but I just don’t like the voice 🤷🏻‍♀️
Whenever I watch ur videos I can't stop laughing, and u make me a non-stop laugher when u try to act like Mirabel 🤣🤣🤣
If you are the eldest of your siblings this somg will really get to you. The lyrics just hits different cause you can resonate with Luisa and how much shes depended on by her family.
9:16 Wtf🤣🤣
the voice actor is so attractive 😭
This poured the film into my heart.  I was enjoying it but I was connected fully here.  I relate.  I’m sure many do.
9:15 his "wtf" made me laugh so hard, relatable reaction to that bicep juggling
10:27 know that we don't talk about him
What happened to Bruno was everyone saw the worst in him and his family saw the worst In him and he moved in the walls to protect mirabel(don't ask why idk)
is it real that almost every singer use autotune that's why it's different on live or stage performance
To busy partying with the damn rats and racoons, 🤣
Me being 31 this song is so sad
Please react to Japanese ver of surface pressure!!
"Objectively we know, for us to sing our throats have to be closed"  *so I proceeded to choke myself*
It sounds like it’s layered. Like they patch together her voice. I’m glad I heard your assessment. I just thought it was so weird when she’s hanging off the cliff there’s a weird shift in her voice and it sounds like her regular singing voice. Then when she gets out of the water the “Luisa” voice comes back in 😂 I thought it was so weird when I heard it.
😂😂😂 Basically 99.9% of the video is him fiddling with his earplugs😂😂😂
why did u say the F word it a swear word
Tristan   you    are     talking    so    much
I think they autotuned the unicorn section.
when he said "what happened to Bruno?" I imiedietly started sing we don't talk about bruno
I didn't expect to react to this song quite like it seemed some people in the comments did. But damn... yeah this weirdly got my choked up about the character. I hadn't watched the movie yet but man now I feel like I have to!
Lisa looks like Tristan
I love how he searched “encanto strong lady” just got me laughing🤣🤣🤣
I have no idea how I got myself watching your video but I have to say you are a cool dude.
I know abuela is all about dat miracle candle but she also love her gaslighting!
Uncle Bruno
“Why does she dance do well?”  Cuz she’s Colombian 😂
This is the difference between hiring actual voice actors instead of a list celebrities. They can do these amazing things that only vocal professionals can pull off.
The crust is pretty tough if think about it hard enoughf
I think this is my favorite vocal performance in the movie, one of my favorite in a Disney movie I think ever
Congrats on 1M views! You deserve it!
When he said “WhY iS sHe DanCInG sO wElL” I started laughing to the point of tears! My mom was like “wth is wrong with you?”
9:15 Because Luisa is Best Character.
" just because you can lift heavy rocks doesnt mean you can song gurl"     Ayo tht got me dying
*i fucking love this song*
Why do u look like that guy from Smosh
XD 9:11 9:21 9:14 9:18 9:19 9:21 9:26 9:27
I love the donkeycorns in this song 💕
You should've watched the movie with headphones, if you did, you could hear the sounds moving around.
My favorite song. I love when said "this song is amazing the fuck?"
I'll never understand why disney didn't do a brief visual gag/reference to THEIR OWN IP (Disney's Hercules) when the name is mentioned in the song. missed opportunity there. Renaissance Disney wouldn't've hesitated, smh  also bro ty for doing technical analysis on the vocals here, it's so interesting and like just listening to it makes my throat hurt lol
2:58 NOTHINGS WRONG!!!!!
I never enjoyed comemntary like this. But you hit the nail on the head. My wife loves this song and your break down was excellent.
This song is amazing the F-quack   like lol in gonna die ur funy
please stop you are not reacting to the video you are doing a commentary.
You're such a good vocal coach
Are you happy 😁???
This song is so underrated!
I just watched the movie, and now I'm sitting here pissing myself to your reaction😂. "Why does she dance so well?.. What The Fuck?" 🤣😭
you got me there 8:50 haha
9:16 I love when he says what the fuck when he is literally shaking Mirabel on her muscle
6:51 tho
Honestly one of the best Disney songs in a long time!
Sorry to comment on another artists react video (I don't how else to ask :l)  but can you react to Tvxq Max Changmin Devil or Fever or  Maniac
9:17 got me dead asfff
No ur right I’d be PISSEDD if I had the mf before room that everyone gets/got before they got their powers
Luisa Madrigal= has pro tixtoker chakra.
Finally someone blind reacting to the song while watching the movie. So they understand what's happening
I love this guy
Luisa: “And I glow cuz I know what my worth is” … Also Luisa: “ I’m pretty sure I’m worthless if I can’t be of service” What a toxic way to view yourself🥺  I blame the abuela for telling them “ Your gift will be as special as you” … if you reverse that it’s like saying you’re only as special as you gift and without one, you’re not😬
You should listen to songs from Sing 2 or 1
ISTG At 2:58 when Luisa yells, Mirabel and Tristan have the same reaction omgggg
Tristan: Who's Bruno? Me: Have you been living under a rock for the past four months?
I like her voice in her actual register, I just can't stand the character voice singing. Wish they just let her actually sing the whole time or not give her an almost pitch shifted voice from the get go, because the song is so well written I just can't get past her spoken tone.
“With the rats and raccoons”😭😂💀💀
yOuR gOnNa MaKe Me DrOp A dOnKeY😒
Best song in the movie. I mean all of the songs are some of the best Disney songs ever but Surface Pressure takes my first place.
7:42 under the SURF-ace. God the amount of details they put into it, every 2 seconds something different
its Tristan's "nO mIStaKes" with the growl for me
THE ENTIRE VIDEO I WAS WAITING FOR THE LITTLE SCREAM AT 7:53
OMG OMG OMG TRISTAN IF YOUR SEEING THIS I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT IVE BEEN A SINGER  SINCE I WAS YOUNGER AND YOU LITTERALLY INSPIRE ME SO MUCH
SHUTUP HE LIKED MY COMMENT
the "AND TRIST FAM" makes me smile everytime
Ummm did Tristan swear
In spanish please
you look like rifty
This song is such a vibe but holy it delivers a strong message about mental health and how not one person can do it all
" I bet she doesn't sing "   Luisa: HOLD MY DONKEY
I wish this guy made a video on Anastasia. I always thought she sings with 2 voices. One light and feminine, other rather heavy.
3:00  Boss: "Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures." Me: *They're the same picture.*
Jessica Darrow, the voice actress, songs it.
HELP MY MOM JUST SAID YOU LOOK CUTE AND SHE WANTS ME TO SEND A VIDEO OF YOU
6:57
React to johnys craig’s voice!!!
Dancing donkeys
8:25 sounds sooo sad to me
Gurl turned from bodybuilder to a tik tok dancer
Discount bruno
1:44 we dont talk about him 10:27 someone we dont talk about
Homies facial expressions are so confusing 😂I can’t tell if he’s loving it or hating it at some points lmaoo
“‘Opening the throat' is defined as a technique whereby pharyngeal space is increased and/or the ventricular (false) vocal folds are retracted in order to maximize the resonating space in the vocal tract. Opening the throat involves raising the soft palate (velum), lowering the larynx and assuming ideal positions of the articulators (the jaw, lips and tongue), as well as shaping of the mouth and use of facial muscles.”  I had to kind of debunk what you were saying about open throat because I’m a voice major at UNT, a world-renowned music school. “Open throat” is lowering your larynx and lifting your soft palate to create a more open, resonant sound. What you were doing was tightening your throat, in a way that I believe wasn’t allowing your vocal folds to come together properly. Real open throat is typically more used in classical singing, however, it can be helpful in pop singing as well. Open throat is GOOD for singing. Anyway. No disrespect intended, I’m sure you’re great at what you do. I just wanted to talk about this
This is the best vocal explanation of this song I've seen. Super informative. Being ignorant of any vocal training myself I didn't even notice how it DOES sound completely different in the higher registers but my brain doesn't even compute that it isn't just as strong and full of a sound as the lower ones.
A mi tambien me encantó 😔  Loved your reactions.   *Fangirling
The donkeys. 💀😭
You just made me understand why my voice disappears when I try to do low notes
mowy   can be the strong one boy friend
This is my favorite song hands down. As soon as I heard it, I was OBSESSED.
4:01 ✨JuSt BeCaUsE yOu CaN LiFt HeAvY RoCkS DoSeN’t MeAn yOu cAn sInG giRl✨
Wow
oHAH
Wait are you... Cisco Ramon?!?!
Quite possibly my favorite Disney song ever created. It's so masterful on every level.
I seen this movie so many time  But it’s never enough  Love it
Tristan: what happened to bruno?!  my brain: WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BRUNO NO NO NO
THIS MOVIE IS TOO DAMN GOOD I CANT
FUN FACT: There was a guy in the background which might be "Bruno"
By twang do you mean vibrato?
Who am I if I can't run with the ball.... This is a Hercules/ Altas reference.  620-590 B.C. In gratitude, Prometheus told Hercules the secret to getting the apples. He would have to send Atlas after them, instead of going himself. Atlas hated holding up the sky and the earth so much that he would agree to the task of fetching the apples, in order to pass his burden over to Hercules.
This movie has the greates inclusion of race, gender, bodies, and just everything, but what we are missing is some LGBTQ representation, I know this isn't the place to say it, but it almost covered all bases of diversity
this song makes me kind of cry
4:35 this statement where she is like "was hercules ever like yo i dont wanna fight surebrus" has that kind of sarcasm in her voice that makes her seem very confident of what she can do with her powers this also happens in 7:38
She’s fabulous!
Ya know what dolores used to be my fav now it luisa
Please react to the songs in the animated movie vivo
Can we get a reaction to Andrew Garfield in tick tick boom!!
Isabela: *scoffs* 🙄
I've been listening to this song all night it is amazing and hits so hard love nothing but love ❤️
Luisa’s song makes me want to cry so badly
Encanto is inspired by the clothes, the food, the fauna and landscapes in Colombia South Amerika and the magical culture of Colombia.  I really liked your reaction
Amanda Palmer would have been great singing this song.
Why are some of the clips being cut out?
Growling is literally my favorite part of singing in general 😭
"she's gonna rap?" got me.
9:15 that wtf reaction cracked me up lol
Thematically the change in her vocals is meant to show when she's being strong and when she's allowing herself to feel and be herself.
There was a really interesting article where Jessica explains that this song allowed her to sing in a way that was natural to her! She had said that in the past in musical theatre she had to train herself not to sing in her normal tone because it wasn't something wanted. She would strain her voice a lot to sing in a more acceptable/marketable range. She had to break out of this tiny box she had put herself in to be able to sing this song!
Me be like want to sing but 🙂

Press you like a drip drip drip that will never stop pressure like a drip drip drip down never stop oh oh give it to your sisters your sisters stronger see if she can hang on a little longer waa oh oh
Her performance was fantastic I thought. It blew me away when I watched the movie. She hit out of the park.
Unpopular opinion, this song is better than We Don't Talk About Bruno. This is my favorite song from the movie. I thought her vocals were interesting because of the deeper, manly voice of the character. It reminds me of when Mulan is pretending to be a boy, but she sings she sounds normal.
Why does she dance so well 👁👄👁 I’m weak 😂😂😂
6:56 ayooooo
I have watch this moved before😮😃💕💕🤗
I don't like this guy, the way his criticism on the song is pointless when he can't even sing himself
Not raccoons, coati.
I see so many vocal coaches just laughing and saying it's great but not actually telling me anything technical about it. Love seeing Tristan actually tell us new information, because that's what I'm coming for.
When I was first watching this movie (a couple hours ago) I genuinely hated Luisa's voice.  Sounded fake, like Elizabeth Holmes' "public voice".  And then this song happened and... woah.  I'm going to need to let this marinate for a little bit, but at least for the moment, this might just be my favorite song in any Disney movie.  It's definitely going to be in the top tier no matter what.  Huge props to Jessica for this incredible performance, and Lin for the incredible songwriting.  Even if the song was in Simlish you could know exactly what it's about just from the voice.  You nailed it by saying it's like two characters.  Forget the technical vocal range stuff, this is internal conflict.  Who she wants to be vs who she is expected to be.  The lower voice sounds an affectation, because it IS!  So good!
you should react to "who needs a boy" from big mouth!, i would be so happy!!
2:43 hell yeah it is!
The persons name who sang it Jessica Darrow btw
When he said "This song is amazing, tf"..I felt that
When you asked “who’s bruno?” Immediately my Mind went “we don’t talk about bruno”
The voice actors voice is naturally deeper so it wouldn’t be too difficult to sing<33
Tristan: It's gonna be hard for this character to sing. Luisa:
this is low alto power.
*10 donkeys dancing around luisa. Tristan: "Why does she dance so well?" o_o is that what concerns you????
I didn't know Cisco sings
The BEST one I think! :)
anyone else scream “ & TrisFAM” ???? just me ?? LOL
I love people cause
Her room looks the way it does because she is still in the nursery. She never came into her powers so she was kept in the nursery with her little cousin. The special rooms come in when the powers come in. I think its a bit f_cked up that she didnt get her own bedroom though, even if there was no power involved.
"what happened to Bruno?"  We don't talk about Bruno 😂😂
The fact that Mirabel still lives in the nursery of her house is awful and physically hurts me
When Lucia’s voice changes it always has to do with what she’s saying or what we see in the song. Strong Lucia has a deep “open voice” but scared Lucia is softer, whereas the “day-dream” Lucia is soft and fairy like. I haven’t finished the video yet but I thought that was interesting and I haven’t noticed that before
I say all the time that this song is SO MUCH more impressive than We Don't Talk About Bruno. That song is a wonderful ensemble. THIS song is an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING solo with changes in tone and overall mood by just ONE singer!
To be fair the best quote we got out of this movie is a response. Rando: "Who is Bruno?" Fandom: "We don't talk about Bruno." Me: "we don't talk about him, we sing  about him 🤣."
Kinda annoyed how this guy underestimated Luisa like the same people putting pressure on her in the movie.
I grew to love this song cuz of my 3rd graders lol. They love to listen to this song
Absolutely the BEST SONG in "Encanto." I know everyone is losing their mind over "We Don't Talk About Bruno" (which is a spectacular, more traditionally staged broadway showtune) but for my money this is the superior track. Just spectacular!!
Tristan: Who is bruno? Me:we dont talk about bruno no no noo🤣
So its uncle
Man every single time I just listen to this song with the clip I cry. IT'S SO GOOD. 🥹
Real men watch Disney :)
it is so nice seeing alto representation in a disney movie. first time i watched this movie i got full on goosebumps during this song.
"Preassure and it drip drip drip" "HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS"
Mirabel does not have magic so she did not get a magic room.
Me: loving the the song him: swears when Luisa uses her muscles as a wave. Me: turns my volume down lol
Me: loving the the song him: swears when Luisa uses her muscles as a wave. Me: turns my volume down lol
i love the lyrics so much
9:17 I'm dead same reaction I had
9:15     "What the ****"     Its soo funny!! AAHH, i cant stop replaying it!
I guess what they say is true: Those that can't, teach. Cause this "Vocal coach" (which I highly doubt he is) has a nightmare invoking voice. Also need to wash and comb his hair.
the genuine fear of "Oh god please don't" to the thought of being sued by disney
Is he bruno
me when luisa says the grown ups:  girl!! you're like 19, you ARE a grown up.
Love this and love your videos ♥️
This is my favorite song of the movie, though “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is amazing, the message of this one is so relatable on top of also being absolutely stunning and fun to listen to!
I love your breakdown off this song gives so much insight into the technicallity of the song.
He needs to just watch the movie lol
NOTHING'S WRONG!!!! 👁_👁
No one is talking about how Disney is literally animateing a camera man in this song, if you don't pay attention to the beautiful lyrics and the beautiful visuals then you will notice that the way the camera moves makes it seem like there is a human behind the camera even though there is nothing  That's takes A LOT of talent to animate something this smoothly
when man said "what happened to bruno?" i was like "we dont talk bout bruno no no no"
Could you react to Carlos vives mi encanto. It's short in the movie but it's such a bright and beautiful song
You can literally hear the auto-tuning made to deepen the lower parts of her voice where the voice actor does not sound like that naturally in those parts 🤨
The "what the fuck" at 9:15 always kills me 😭
I’m a 42 year old carpenter who listens to dream theater.   I couldn’t get this song out of my head when I first heard it.
THE ENVIRONMENT IN THAT MOVIE IS ALMOST REAL, THE COFFEE ZONE IN COLOMBIA IT'S LIKE THAT. IT'SINSPIRED IN COCORA'S VALLEY, RIGHT THERE IN COLOMBIA, A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND MAGICAL PLACE
You kinda look like Anthony Padilla from an angle
Luisa knows how to do everything she’s a material girl💅🏻😜
KATY PERRY "NEVER REALLY OVER" SNL PERFORMANCE AND HER NEW SONG 'WHEN I'M GONE" ? PLEASEEE THANK YOU
The canal was breaking don’t you get it god you watch the show
6:51 Tristan was so proud of that run and I’m so here for it- I was smiling along with him😅😅
"Who's bruno?" Me:👁👄👁
This song is sooo insanely good. not only the music and the singing. the lyrics.. just tugs at the hearstrings so damn hard!
You made me appreciate this song even more. The actress did such an awesome job.
My question is why would Disney wanna sue you for posting reactions to their videos and movies when they're making 1000x what you make In a second
This was so fun to watch! I LOVE this song and it was so enjoyable to see you experience it for the first time!
she lives in the nursery bro, she aint got no room cuz she aint got no powers 😭😭😭
You: What happened to Bruno?  Me: Well, you see, we don’t talk about it.
I like how she goes into that higher voice when she talks about her insecurities and has the tougher bigger voice when she is talking about her strength
'why does she dance so good? What the fuck??' 😂😂😂
PLEASE react to Wish by Trippie Redd by audiomack with the live orchestra in the background. I think that would be a great vocal track to react to
When l was watching the movie l could not help but to repeat this song so many times it's that good .I  mean this is one of the best Disney songs ever followed by We don't talk about Bruno . Disney did an amazing job on this cartoon and we appreciate the vocal singers and actors ♥️. like wow this is amazing !!!!!! I can sing how amazing encanto is everyday. Am l the only who is obsessed with Encanto ?🤩
It's sad the grandmother didn't get her mirabel power is the house its self because she is the only one who can communicate with the house
Nice to know that vocal coaches and I both get excited about the gravelly parts in songs
i love this song so much and the character. I have not understand the bruno song when this exist! omg.. <3 cant wait for brunos song tho
4:13 👀
I'm sorry but the critique in this video was really shitty could've been nicer it seemed and came off really cocky and rude
The laugh 😂😂
I love this song and your analysis is just as great as the song.
Can you do all for us by labyrinth and Zendaya from euphoria
I swear this song had literal CRACK put into it
Bruno he has the specialest power of all
I know that Luisa is the middle child (I’m the oldest in my family) I feel like she really relates to me
4:01 Remember when Tristan was like , “just because you can lift heavy rock doesn’t mean you can sing girl” 😂😂😂 literally a couple minutes later 5:56
Okay something I think is so fascinating that the character depicted is that a common problem with body builders and people with really muscular frames are a lack of flexibility and mobility so it’s interesting how she started the song really rigid almost and then by the climax of it when Tristan comments on her dancing it’s suddenly much more fluid and mobile as in dancing could even be something Luisa enjoyed doing but never had the time or flexibility to practice that and once she finally let’s go she literally is so fluid
How do people actually like this song?
can you react RBD live in Rio Este Corazon
can you react RBD live in Rio Este Corazon
When your like du du du then I really laughed
Never seen the movie but heard the song on tictok. Saw your reaction video clip there too. Came to watch the whole video. A+ content! Probably not gonna watch the movie but as a girl with a “deeper” voice and no Disney princess waistline😒 I appreciate this character and relate to the song. Also it’s pretty catchy
"Who's Bruno?!" we dont talk about bruno...
Keep strong. Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love.  Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world's previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don't think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God's perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says "the soul that sins shall die" - if we break one in thought/word/deed it's as if we're guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans   . The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God's perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn't and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom.   If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It's about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it's impossible without depending on His power and instruction).   He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ's death as our own in our place.   He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.   He doesn't want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can't. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way.   Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace. In the world you have tribulation and distress and suffering, but be courageous [be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy]; I have overcome the world.” [My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.] -  (AMPLIFIED version)   NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you've done or what you're going through you CAN make it through Jesus.   If you have any questions let me know x
Please react to yebbas tiny desk!!🙏🏼
She does go into a higher register but she does a great job at keeping those lower growly bits throughout. I appreciate this song because I naturally have a deeper voice and vocal range and this is one of the few Disney songs I can sing along to without switching octaves. Thank God I work from home so I can sing along without judgment 😂
5:20 Luisa ❎ Strong Lady✅  Not hate but this got me 🤣🤣
I love this song as much as We don't talk about bruno
luisa: is having a mental breakdown. also luisa: *tiktok dancing*
Your reaction is so amazing!!!
So her song switches from the deep almost gutteral voice to the lighter “twangier”😂 version has multiple purposes and is honestly so genius. It’s  to represent the fight for Luisa between her facade of being strong and impenetrable to her reality of the fears of not being enough or somebody hurting her family due to her shortcomings. Then it goes on the the lightest part of the song being used to show her desires to be more carefree.  I loved learning that it also had a utility purpose for switching her tones as well! Great video!
I love Isabella for her muscles she is such a comforting personality that women dont have to fit in the norm body shapes set for women the hour glass shape. And she also resembles the symbolic image og how we carry ourselves when we are given alot of pressure from family dramas basically getting thicker skin and stronger muscles because of being to hard on ourselves
The donkeys dancing near the end is fucking killing me. I can't take this song seriously with that part.
Can we talk about tue donkeys dance moves to
all the things you are critiquing is LITERALLY the point of her character she has a lot of pressure to be strong she cant just be a girl/ relax
Lol idk if this is weird but this song made me cry haha
Why is no one talking about her voice at 7:30 ?! It’s my favorite part, it’s like a third voice ( between the singing and talking voice I feel) and I absolutely love how she sounds at that part. Is it growl? What is it that makes that part sound so amazing???
Watching Tristan try to understand why he is so deeply attacked to Luisa... we know man... we know. The entire world is confused now.
There are various theories on Mirabel and her relationship to the Casita and the Miracle, none of which change the fact that she was left in the nursery for 10 years like the proverbial butterfly stuck in a cocoon. To me, it is another way that the creators show the unhealthy relationship the family has developed with the Miracle. No one seemed to ask "what now" for Mirabel. Not even her parents, who are loving and supportive. Was she supposed to spend the remainder of her life living in the nursery? Everyone just accepted that if the Miracle didn't give Mirabel a Gift related room, she didn't get a room at all (even a normal one). Abuela was shown directing the house several times. The family helped to build the village. Between them all, they could have created a place for Mirabel (both in the house and the family). The fact that they didn't reinforces the idea that there are issues in the family.
I find it ironic how in the songs where the sisters express how they feel, they hit unexpected notes, like Luisa starts hitting higher notes, Isabella gets less airy and goes a little deeper at times, and Mirabel shows off her expansive range
tristan: what happened to bruno?" me: we don't talk about bruno-no-no-no
Encanto strong lady 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I also like that the segments where Luísa has to tighten her voice to hit the higher pitch are when she's also most strained in the song, handling some ridiculous threat.
The vocals are fantastic, but the lyrics are in another level entirely.  Listening to it you really  start to understand her issues beyond just being the physically strong character.  She's required to be emotionally strong and shoulder everything anyone throws at her regardless of what it is.  This character is extremely relatable.
2:58 LMAO you and mirabel made the same exact face XD. I'm dying laughing rn
I love this so much!
When you asked “what happened to Bruno?” We don’t talk about Bruno 🤣
By far Luisa is my favorite character and this is my favorite song!  Glad you enjoyed!
OMG I looooved this reaction! Tristan you ALWAYS get deep into the technique of who is singing and I LOVE IT
This song DESERVES a Grammy...or a nomination at the very least.
You should listen to the german version of it! ^-^
6:56 im dying hahahahaha
9:15 RIGHT?! LUISA HAS NO REASON TO HAVE SUCH SMOOVE MOVES LIKE THAT! 🤩😍🥰
React Anitta, BOYS DON'T CRY... perfect song, beautiful clip, you're going tomorrow...
React Anitta, BOYS DON'T CRY... perfect song, beautiful clip, you're going tomorrow...
Someone said Luisa's room might just be a home made gym and I'm very conflicted
4:01 💀
Jessica Darrow plays Lucisa her voice is very deep and nice, and the song is amazinggg
I love surface pressure
You should react to the Spanish versions, they are very good
This song literally makes me tear up every time. No matter how hard I fight it "pressure like a drip drip drip" grabs me so hard. Loved your reaction!
Bruno’s the uncle
i’ve been avoiding the newer disney movies but this one i might actually watch cause of the message and i love this song lol
Mirabel does not get a gift btw if you did not know
I love the shift between the fabricated, performative "toughness" and her raw, climatic vulnerability. Building such a fantastic character using only one solo is absolutely not something I expected from Disney. They struck gold with Lin.
OMG. You're a guy?! I thought different from your thumbnail. 🤣 Great video, though.
The melody is so catchy. The lyrics is on point. And, the video adds up everything to it. But the whole song, top 3? Still debatable.
I have a crush on Luisa
9:13 - 9:17 Why does she dance so well? What the fu-
this part in the movie always makes me feel like i wanna cry man
Not sure if you have heard this before but you look like Cisco's long lost brother from flash
okay, luisa literally YEETING those rocks into the 20th dimension with HIP STRENGTH ALONE will always be amazing mo matter how many times i see it.
In the bridge she reminds me of the singer of The Fight song.
I just heard this song now. It's good. Is it just me,? or does the girl sound like Hailey Green from the Voice , you know... from Blake's team?
"Why does she dance so well"  The obvious answer is because it's a musical, but  Dance requires a lot of muscle strength to support the actions being... acted upon so it isn't far out that she has good muscle control  It's how did she get that ~technique~ that should be questioned lol
Tristán Said: why she dances so well? SHE IS LATINA !!!
you need a reaction to jessica Darrow singing lol its her real voice!!
I am a metalhead through and through. I have never really cared for many disney songs before, but when i took my kids to see this movie, and this song came on, I was like...whoawtf this is AMAZING
There's a theory, mirabel does have a room. . . But it's occupied by abuela.
Him: What happened to Bruno? Every fan ever: WE DONT TALK ABOUT BRUNO :)
His face when Louisa said nothing wrong 🤣
Part of the "strength" I heard in her voice the first time I listened to this song was how hard and flat she pronounced her r's. It fascinated me.
I love how the singer used the growl to fit with carrying so much weight.
I’m not really a fan of the song, but the singer sounded great.
Fun fact : Luisa started to dance after house fell on her because she saw how scared Mirabel started to be for her
"Why does she dance so well?" same thought lol
Just saying but this is my favorite song in Encanto ✨
please react to boys don't cry by anitta, u won't regret it
Fyi. The singing artist is also the voice actor. You questioned if it was two different people and they are not. Also. May I ask why you take your headphones off so much when the video gets paused?
7:00 the boys when i somehow get the ball:
loving this series!
Him: Who is Bruno? Answer: We don't talk about Bruno. 😂😂😂
TRY REACTING TO ASTN'S COVER OF HAPPIER THAN EVER FROM TIKTOK

I love what else can I do
Can't wait for you to get to Dos Oruguitas.
omg please react to jessica darrow(luisa's VA) doing jazz cover of this song
Keep going! Please do 'What else can I do?', 'Dos Oruguitas' and 'All of you'!
Hola solo quería recordarles que Dios los ama mucho
I’ve been talking with my sister about the similarities between some encanto songs and hamilton songs. I mean it’s obvious right, because they were both lin’s work.   But this song in specific reminds me so much to non stop and hurricane.  Also i saw somewhere that hoping for a miracle is also really similar to burn.   The guns and ships mashup with the family madrigal.   I find it amazing the work put into this but i would love to see these comparisons done because i couldn’t shake the feeling of familiarity with the whole encanto soundtrack. It has in the heights, and hamilton references and a little easter egg of rent in it, i can’t.
Why does she dance so well?… cuz she has the Latin rhythm! Meow!
You look like Cisco from flash
Not me waiting for Tristan to React to the donkeys dancing XD
When he said it was going to be hard for her to hit the high notes and I’m just sitting there waiting for him to hear the rest 👀
Louisa: “NOTHING’S WRONG” Mirabel: 👁👄👁 Tristan: 👁👄👁
React to Distance by Ruel
Can you please react at "what else can i do" song from encanto
The actress/singer actually has such a low voice too
I really like this song because of the lyrics meaning
Mirabel's room isn't great because she lives in the nursery because she didn't get a room.
Maybe the lighter vocal part represents the soft version of Luisa, which others thinks she ain't showing
Mirabel has a sh*t room because each room is supposed to be their “gift” and she doesn’t have one
It kinda sound d like dip Brando instead of bruno
React to jinger pisces !!!
So to understand more what mirabel the girl with green glasses and Luisa the one who is singing the song you have to watch encanto cause that's the name of the movie it has all the songs in it so I would prefer watching the movie to understand what there talking about
What's whith the donkeys
That face on him when Luisa was like "NOTHING'S WRONG" like he was like....😳😳😳😬😦😮😯😲😦😧😨 damn bitch
We can all tell this is probably his fav song so far
"Why does she dance so well?"  Ahm actually, she has a tiktok account. When she's so stressed with the pressure she let's her emotions out there hehe lol
I learn so much things from you than school 😅
uhhh, been 4 days and he was posting this daily, does anyone know where he went?
I love you. You do the BEST music reviews EVER. I love you. Carry on.
These facial expressions are great
You shooud also listen to Dos Oruguitas ❤️
Wow how amazing to be watching this movie for the first time 🥰 I'm about at the 100 mark.
Tristan: "You here that Disney, I'm not uploading your video in full, can't sue me, Hehe" Me: *instantly subscribes
Can you listen to Bohemian Rhapsody...?
Thank you for putting into words the weirdness I noticed about how her voice changed sometimes during the song but couldn't figure out how to express!
Tristan you should react to JenerationDiy’s new music video “clean up in aisle 4”
Best alto/tenor tbh

Sir this is a kids movie so you cannot cuss while reacting to have a splendid day sir
Her voice is like Duke’s Mayonnaise : It’s got twaaaaaaang~!
your hair
I was unpleasantly surprised the first time I heard most of the Encanto songs. It sounds like they didn’t use any professional singers. I can hear now that there’s some method to that madness, but I grew up with traditional Disney songs and it was a grating shock to hear Luisa sing the first time. Especially since Lin Manuel’s casting for Hamilton has been enormously talented.  She’s demonstrative and it’s a blast to listen to. I guess that’s all that matters.
Hahaha I want to be friends with you
4:01 I was just about to say "yass queen💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾"  right here 😂😂
Please react to Claire Crosby singing this song
Hi!!! Can I ask for a favor. I'd be glad and be delighted if you'll do a reaction to SB19's song What and Bazinga. Thank youu!! More powerr!!

This song is so Katty Perryish that is even on the verge of plagiarism.
She kinda sound's like Garnet from Steven Universe
Yeah all of encanto is just Awesome disney truly outdid themselves on this one
I love this so much. I laughed so hard at your comments and watching these breakdown videos makes me LOVE this song even more!!
Are you going to react to "what else can I do?" Next?
pls also react to the jazz cover!!
Luisa and Luisa's voice actor are GORGEOUS
“Their to busy partying with the goddam rats and raccoons” 💀
Jessica Marrow (voice of Luisa) also did an alternate version of Surface Pressure and its amazing 😻 😻 😻 so different and still so awesome.
One thing I found interesting is that the low/high difficulty seems to have been taken into account as she mostly goes into higher notes when her anxiety is starting to get uncontrollable (including when she gives in to wanting to relax). Her low notes are for her bravado, trying to keep up to her role.
I've seen this movie before it's good but sad
You should react to the sing 2 music!!
I'm thinking it should be noted that this song is aso awesome because if you pay attention, when she sings about the pressure she feels its in a higher..more "vulnerable" but when she sings about how tough she has to be its in a deeper voice
Is it just me or is his voice not traditionally appealing? It’s odd that he criticizes more than the technical aspects of the songs and also his little cartoon looks nothing like him. His perception is off to me. Just a thought
I love how you and luisa are staring at each other 😂😂😂😂
Please stop giving Disney credit for these songs. Disney didn’t write these songs. These songs were written by Lin Manuel Miranda! Giving him credit for the genius musical compositions of these songs.
that was exactly my reaction when I saw this the first time. WtF! lol
so far this video just...hurts. i loved to see luisa on screen and singing, her voice is low like mine and a lot of other peoples'. we can still sing, just because we have a different voice than the usual "high and whiny" doesn't mean we can't. edit: watched it through, still pretty hurt from this and definitely part of why i never took vocal jazz like i wanted to. we get made fun of our voices all the time and ngl probably one of the reasons y'all are always lacking singers and performers with naturally deeper registers 🤷 that's just how i feel though.
The donkeys actually match Luisa's expression when she says NOTHINGS WRONG.  even calming down like woah sorry, that just came out.
We don't talk about Bruno
In another video you mentioned that the songs sound more like musical theater, the songs were pretty much composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda so that’s probably why 😂
React to tick tick boom come to senses
React to Let somebody go Coldplay and Selena Gomez please
Hopefully Mirabel gets her own room cause what happens if she gets married? It'd be awkward as hell to be "creating more kids with powers" in the NURSERY😭😂 And I'd assume her siblings or cousins would have kids by that time so she'd have no privacy with her partner 💀😂
I cannot wait for you to get to Dos Orugitas!! 🦋 truly a masterpiece
Also you should check out the spanish version. Also an incredible singer
Please please please react to ‘never enough’ by Loren Allred live !!!!!!
Bro you need to watch the movie lol
I want to see you reacting to Dos Oruguitas already😭🥺
We didn't get enough Luisa in this movie.
YESSSS I love Surface Pressure SO much! <3 Luisa ♥

React to we don't talk about bruno in spanish!!!!!!! PLEAAASEEE IS SO GOOD
Luisa is baby
"ill bet she doesnt sing' hes in for a treat haha
You should react to the songs it the movie sing 2!! They are really good and underrated

I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DONT LISTEN TO ISABELLA SONG IM GONNA FORCE YOU TO LISTEN TO IT
omg you're so beautiful that I can't focus on video
will you be finishing ADELE one night only?
1:44 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BRUNO 😂
"this song is fantastic"-   * INSTEAD WE MEASURE-*
There’s a meme/joke that Luisa would have every K-Pop or other boy band songs and choreography down to a tee
Can you react to the belle movie songs?
Please u have to react to 'jigsaw' by conan gray Its a masterpiece 😍😍 Btw your videos are really entertaining, I watch them all
Can you react to Runaway by Aurora live ?
The real question isn’t how to she dance so well but how do the donkey-corns dance so well. 😂
PLEASE DO SET ME FREE BY JOSHUA BASSET IVE BEEN WAITING😩
Its disney logic ;-;
Sir, just watch the movie!!!
1:45
i wonder if you're gona upload we don;t talk abotu bruno again, this time with understaning the context!
Probably my favorite song from the movie! 🥰
I think it's clever how she uses the higher parts with twang to show a bit more weakness. When she 1st sings the chorus she sings it with the open throat, but the last time she sings it softer with twang. The balance of when she does what is really cool, she has so much control! Didn't even notice this till you pointed it out, so I like how in your reaction you are actually analyzing the song, not just an emotional reaction.
Boys that is going to be surface
Please react to The Weeknds new album.  Please please please
You NEED TO react to Conan Gray's new songs "Jigsaw" and "People watching"
One thing I feel is a big take away is the pressure like a drip drip drip, that’ll never stop. meaning it never stops it only builds, she feels no escape.  I imagine a bucket above her with water just dripping into it filling crushing her slowly  And I wonder if she almost feels like an experiment, give it to your sister, see if she can hang on a little longer… I just picture everyone in a room above her watching her like a project and she Carrie’s everything thrown at her.   And my favorite verse that no one seems to catch is, give it to your sister and never wonder, if that same pressure would pull you under. That’s huge…   Also here is your bonus… the donkeys does this represent her being the family pack mule?
U should react to Miley and Noah Cyrus singing "Jolene"
Waiting your reaction to "Dos Oruguitas" from Sebastriian Yatra
I just learned, or gained the ability, to growl and it’s sooooo empowering! I feel the struggle of trying to do so beforehand!
I am new to this channel and he Said SOME BAD WOREDS SO I WILL NEVER WATCH AGAIN sorry no hard feelings
It feels realistic that Louisa can sing like that, and that's really impressive. To go out of a character's vocal range but still sound like it's them singing.
React to “I cant stop me” by Twice
"This song is amazing, the fuck??" - Me. Literally me.
she didnt get a room, that's the point🤣
Listen to tick tick boom!! You need to hear Andrew!
I kinda like to think that the deeper more strong voice Luisa sings with in the beginning is more like a bravado or persona of her strength she constantly has to put on but as she lets go and becomes more vulnerable she starts to sings at a higher pitch with is closer to how she talks normally
This is my favorita song ❤️
I think the duality in her voice adds to her character of being strong and sensitive at the same time
React to light switch pls!
hello tristan! i dont know if u take requests or not but i hope you could react to tick tick boom too. it's a very good musical movie!
The lyricism is LUSH in this song. The rhymes. The alliteration. Every sentence carried meaning. Fantastic.
did you can reacts sing 2
me sitting here waiting for the "what else can i do" reaction 👀
Now next we need what else can I do
Can you react to doughnut by twice?
Now do the what else i can do song🤟😔
Now do the what else i can do song🤟😔
Ohmygodd I finally found you again Tristan,,,, Ever since this movie came out I’ve been looking for your channel but I couldnt remember the name 😭😭
This character is very relatable. I mean I'm sure everyone here has gone through something like this! But wow her voice is so strong at points, to just slow down to a point were she can relax. But then again getting piled with all this (Surface Pressure) makes her feel like shes gonna crack! This song has such a strong message that so many people really can relate to, and I'm so excited to see whats next for future Disney movies! Also damn girl those growls!!
Mate you need to react to "What else can I do".... Like its good asf.
3:07 is the song reaction
This is the only song I actually liked from the movie.
This is the only song I actually liked from the movie.
This is the only song I actually liked from the movie.
This is the only song I actually liked from the movie.
please. watch this movie tristan
The lyric hit hard when you it to so much😭
There's a real character beat at the end of the song, after the donkeycorns when the red light is on.  She's still in that light voice of relaxed Luisa, still Luisa without the shell.  Then as the weight piles on and we get to "never breaks, no mistakes" and there's this snap into full-on growling.  The shell is back on with a vengeance and everything else is shoved behind this mask of toughness.  I love how they capture that with a momentary vocal technique.
Can you react to Belle Song Medly?
you turned into my music teacher
Yees, for me this is the best one of the Songs.. Such a great vocalist, strong charackter , relatable and fragile.Songwriting is just incredible in this one. I love the transition from strong verse to the chorus so much.and that "c-part" Is just awesome. Grateful for lin Manuel Miranda.. My reaction was basically the same.
You should react to lost in paradise its such a bop song and I think you will like it
8:27 wow  goose bumps
Can you please react to "What else can I do?" next?
Love this song! I agree I think there was some kind of producer trickery going on with her voice to get that lower register, but the song itself is so damn good I don't even care
I think Your My Fav Youtuber😭✨
Fun fact for those who didn’t know. Jessica has a pretty low speaking voice so the low notes come pretty naturally for her.
We need every single song.
I personally i dont like this song because i am VERRYY aware of how different her voice sounds. Its very noticeable to ME and it kinda ruins it for me
When did Anthony Padilla learn how to sing?
I think that she goes into more of a singing voice vs her strong voice cause the parts where she finally lets Mirabel see “under the surface” she stops pretending to be strong and becomes herself. As if that strong voice isn’t her voice and it’s just her pretending. Her voice is actually the singing voice.
so the next song is what else can I do pls it's isabelas song in encanto
Jessica Darrow singing this LIVE.  U should definitely watch that
You should react to dos oruguitas that’s my absolute favorite song from enchanto!!!
The thing is I don’t think he knew that the voice actor literally doesn’t have to make a voice because she sounds like it talking normally kind of
@4:35 was my reaction to the song lol when I first heard it
Can you please react to Nemahsis
0:58 “They too busy partying with the gawd damn rats and raccoons” idk why but that one got me good 😂😂😂😭😭😭
react some Encanto songs in another langagues
when tristan said "it'll be hard for her to sing if she doesn't add the twang" i waited for the bridge, i knew he'll say something about it.
Okay but Antonio was breaking them moves 💃🏻🕺🏻
9:15 I'm dead 😂😂😂
this song gives me gay panic
You should react to what else can I do from Encanto.
9:14 has me dying
Please react to chloexhalle. Halle is going be our next Ariel.
DO WHAT ELSE CAN I DO, COLUMBIA MI ENCANTO, AND ALL OF YOU
I am obsessed with your videos 🤩
"DRIP DRIP DRIP DRIP HuH" BAAHA
i cant get over the fact that his face always looks hilarious in the thumbnails
REACT TO HAMILTON!
Jessica darrow (the voice actor and singer) actually has a some bts of her singing the song on her Instagram.
I love that her voice is big, full and strong when she’s talking about her strength. Then it is more fragile when she talks about her weakness and fear.
Hiii can you please react to ROSÉ's "Gone" live on sea of hope??
Tristan, are you transitioning to a woman?
yes
This song honestly is so heavy, and has a very deep meaning. But sseriously is a bop. 💜
I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing you compaire isabella in "what else can I do" against her moments in "we don't talk about bruno"
3:19 I'M VERY BIG VERY STRONG... ₕᵢₕᵢ
My God, Lin Manuel really knows what the f he's doing! He's amazing and picks amazing songs, perfect for these actors to perform, making them shine and even realize their potential.
This was my favorite video!! I love Tristan soo much! Upload them all please!! Who else wants the raw 2 hour video of him watching it?!🤣👍🏽
UR SO FUNNY XDDD

Please please please react to Claire Crosby singing this song!! Sooo good for such a young girl!
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
The room is the nursery that the children stay in until they get their powers (which comes with a room),so Mirabel never got her own room, which is also why Casita can still interact with her in her bedroom.
AND TRISFAMMMMMM !!! WHAT’S UP
Can you react to Mac Ayres?? There’s this song called Easy…
WE LEARNED WHO BRUNO WAS IN "The Family Madrigal"!! TOT He's the UNCLE of Mirabel
“this song is amazing tha fawk” lmaoo im subbing to you now

Tristan: "what happened to Bruno." Me: "im here bitch, im a stan."   lmao
Yeahhhhhh so glad you finally did this one it’s by far the best song on the track!!
I'm so obsessed with this song
Please react to Dos Oruguitas! Not sure if there’s a clip of Sebastian singing it but it’s my favorite!
As someone who is tone deaf, it's interesting to hear you describe things I can't hear. Your facial expressions when talking about it were very helpful.
I love this song. Many people can relate to this Surface Pressure. The best song in the whole movie.
The room is the nursery that the children stay in until they get their powers (which comes with a room),so Mirabel never got her own room, which is also why Casita can still interact with her in her bedroom.
Him- Who's Bruno Us- We don't talk about Bruno 🎶
React on Charlie puth new single 'Light Switch '
heyyyyy you should react to 'step back' by GOT the beat. THERE ARE SO MANY VOCAL HIGHLIGHTS IN THAT SONG. btw it's a kpop song by a new gg that consists of top tier artists !
“Why does she dance so well?” Because she’s fucking awesome, that’s why. I don’t believe they weren’t prepared with the merch. They pretty much made her a super hero and Isabella is a spoiled jerk for 95% of the movie.
You should react to 'Michael in the Bathroom' from the musical Be More Chill!!!!
yay finally
i like your video but i physically hurt when your sing please
The way you squeal like a five year old girl 🤣🤣🤣
Ugh I love you
Please react to "Lend Me Your Voice" and "Gales of Song" the English versions by Kylie McNeill from the animated movie Belle. She has such a beautiful voice and the songs are amazing. Please 🙏 🙏 🙏 you won't be disappointed

Best Disney song! It actually makes me cry a little the journey you are taken on not only with the lyrics, but the voice, and the music - I wish I new all the words and could sing like that! Even the visuals in the movie are some of the best storytelling Disney has created.
Can you react to a Mexican band named RBD, they are great

YEEEES
Luisa look like Ninja Turtle
LOVE THIS SONG
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus

When I watched this the first time, I squealed when she growled. Tristan you made my day with this video!
its amazing to watch someone react to this masterpiece of a song for the first time lol
Can you please react too angelina jordan
Quiero un Burricornio
im still waiting for him to react to dawn fm
Be curious to see you react to Peter Collins sometime. Very unique singer.
Dawn FM review pleaseeee
Me over here bothered he didnt comment on the unidonkeys
This song and bruno's are my favorites, but Tristan,  they say who bruno is in the beginning. He is one of the 3 triplets (the babies from the beginning the orginal kids) he was the uncle that could see the future and he disappeared suddenly one day. Thats why he is talked about alot through the start even tho "we dont talk about bruno "
Voice actors singing 'in character' has always fascinated me honestly, it's beyond impressive
Just watched the movie in theaters today.  We definitely won't be getting any movies this decent in a long time lol.
Do. Every. Single. SONG!
Tristan: Breaks down the song Me: *Being Educated* Also Tristan: Doesn't mention the dancing donkeys Also me: .....😢
I’m sorry when i first watch this i couldn’t take the entire thing seriously because of THE FUCKING DONKEYS DANCING LMFAO I WAS CRACKING UP THE ENTIRE TIME
Would you please react to Filipino Boy Group (PPop) SB19, they are the first Filipino and Southeast Asian act that nominated in Billboard Social, including Ariana Grande, BTS, Blackpink and Seventeen. And this day, they dominate the Billboard Hot Trending Songs, they make an history because their song Bazinga is now in the top for about 7th week. You can choose any of their songs  , their vocals is lit to hear.  Thank you I hope you can read this, btw new subscriber here
You never failed to have the best reactions ever😂
So because it took me a couple times watching it with Kiddo to catch it - Mirabel Still Sleeps in the Nursery!!! (with Antonio, but he gets his own room and she's still there).
look up Stephanie Beatraiz’s Rosa Diaz!!!!
The actress is so dang beautiful too
TRISTAN, please can you react to Light Switch by Charlie Puth? 😁💡
You should react to liamani sings on yt she’s so good
Lmao I’m enjoying his reaction to the movie more than the songs
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You should totally react this same style to Tick Tick Boom on Netflix. It was Andrew Garfield as the male lead singer and he does amazing. Also, as I'm writing this, the comments are at 666.....I'm frightened.....😱
Personally i think the way she goes lighter and softer on the "drip drip drip" parts shows vulnerability, she's scared and she sounds smaller and younger as she admits that the pressure is eating away at her. In fact the emotion all the way through is stunning. She gets deep when she's focusing on what she needs to do, like vocally gritting her teeth in preparation and you can actually hear her relax when she wonders what relaxing would be like.
She didn't get a room she is living in the nursery
In reference to the room, they don't get a room until they've got their powers... no powers. No room. It's sort of a bitch move by the house, lol.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO REVIEW THIS SONG SINCE I WATCHED ENCANTO
React to “dos oruguitas” from Encanto pleeeaaaseeeeeee
You should react to Diana Ankudinova. She's another woman with a great dark voice that really shakes you.
Seven foot frame rats along his back when he calls ur name it all fades to black yeah he sees ur dreams and feasts on ur screams ( HEY ) we don’t talk about bruno no, no, we don’t talk about bruno! ( meanwhile just bruno listening in the walls of how much his family hates him ) sad life 😔✋
Wow you actually thought she wasn't going to sing because of her voice.
its actually funny that you say that about her voice because when i first listened to the song in the movie i kid you not, i thought the beginning was a joke. lol but fortunately it did grow on me and is now my favorite song
Pls pls pls I really need you to do a reaction to Lawrence’s don’t lose sight
ENJOYING this so much 💟🤩
I HAVE BEEN EXCITEDLY WAITING FOR YOU TO GET TO THIS SONG!
I’m over here waiting for you to react more Encanto song’s. I’ve been watching you’re reactions back to back. This movie is honestly so so good! I’ll be here waiting (:
Pleease watch "2021 em uma música" by Lucas Inutilismo and if can also whatch de previous one "2020 em uma músic", you won't regret it
Don't worry about pausing. If we wanted to just hear the song we would check the official version. The whole point of reactions is that you add to it
I'm nodding while listening to you explaining techniques as if I understand a little bit of bit lol.
This is what I’ve been waiting for
this song is so beautiful. Luisa's character too. its so great to see a strong woman character. oh how times are changing and we love to see it ! :)
Fun fact!  6:02 is a reference to Big Hero 6!
Please _please_ react to Sebastian Krenz -Still loving you  (Scorpions) from The voice of Germany blinds!!!!
Please react and talk about more songs from animation movies
I'm so glad you finally reacted to this I love this song so fckn much
Are you going to react to any of the tracks on Dawn FM? I would be really interested in your opinion.
REACT TO SING 2
I really appreciate the fact her voice sounds like two different people but her character is literally 2 different people. 1 is who everyone expects her to be. The other is who she truly is and who she truly wants to be
It's my favorite in Encanto
are u gonna react to watercolor eyes?
9:16 an instant swear
Please react to Tick Tick boom
I have been waiting for this! Saw this song before I saw the movie and I ugly cried.  Still get watery every time I hear it 🥺 Great reaction, especially when the beat drops 😉
You’re funny I really enjoy watching your videos lol
This is my absolute favorite song from this movie!!!
I think a lot of people like We Don't Talk About Bruno but I think Surface Pressure is the better song and the best one in the movie.
Surface Pressure is one of my favourite songs!!!!😍😍😍
I love your videos!!!
This is literally the best song Disney has made since mulan. The music in this movie is SOOO good and honestly one of the best films they have released in a while
Luisa’s song is so amazing and it makes me emotional every time. You can also see how motherly she is when she adjusts Mirabel’s glasses
I never realised he said “This Song is amazing, The Fuck” I can’t tell if he actually said it or not-
react to Elis Regina!! She was one of me most amazing brazilian singers EVERRRR you're gonna love her
What else  can i do next pls
your little screams of shock when she starts tik tok dancing give me life lol
you should react to the songs in spanish too, they're basically the same but the actors are amazing too
"gonna be difficult for her to sing" lol she's on Broadway, guy. "Is she just gonna rap?" Got me mad lol Just because a woman speaks or sings comfortably in a bass or alto tone does not mean she's not going to be able to sing well. Closed minded af
react to yuju play please!
9:15 litteraly the same reaction AHAHAHHAHAHA
Her voice kinda reminds me of Katy Perry's
My favourite song from Encanto
Can you please react to STEP BACK BY GIRLS ON TOP, it's full of Vocals!

Do What else Can I do inspirational
Definitely my favorite moment in the movie! 😍
Sick yells Tristan.

i know this is very irrelevent but im a big fan of the show 'supernatural' and just wondered if u had heard Jensen Ackles sing??!
:)
Actually, after listening to this, I think I find the German version by Jennifer Kae (Druck) a bit cooler. The lyrics as well as the voice. ^-^
Can't believe you didn't react to the unicorn/donkeys!! 😱
Listen “Fernando Daniel- Muito mais além” from Frozen 2
I mean, Luisa's VA is alto !! 💗💗💗 SO THINKING ABOUT IT AND APPRECIATING, DISNEY GIVING US AN ALTO SOLO FROM A MOVIE??? DAMMNNN 💕💕🌟🌟💅💅✨✨😩😩😩
I just love peoples face at the “drip drip drip” part it’s SO satisfying
Loved your Encanto reactions!   If you have time please react to Belle (2021) osts next, would love to hear your comments about it. There are 2 versions of each song - Japan & English. Japan are sung by Kaho Nakamura and the English ver are sung by Kylie McNeill but wonderfully both artists sound so similar (at least in my ears).  Plus the movie is so amazing it even got 14 mins standing ovation at Cannes Film Festival. Hope you read this, thank you Tristan!
the transition of lighter sounds also transitions with what Luisa wanted to say, she is pressured and just wanted to relax even for a little. that is why the voice painting sounds good too.
You’re awesome!
the songs of this movie is ✨👌
tristan can you react to (what else can i do) from encanto?
Can you react to love poem cover by mayfly they do some amazing vocals in.
For some reason Darrow's voice reminded me of Ashleigh Ball when she had to transition from having characterization to singing.  And darrow seems like she has a huskiness to her voice? 🤔
Cant wait to see his reaction to we don't talk about Bruno and dos oruguitas
You should do what else can I do next 🌺❤️
stop asking about Bruno, we don't talk about Bruno!
why havent u reacted to billieeilish yet whqt a shame
Why does she dance so well: a second later: What the Fu
I wish he wasn't  milking this as much as he is. Would have been easier to watch all his reaction in one video and not be annoyed at having to go back and forth between videos and getting ad after ad after ad.
GOD I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU REACT TO THE NEXT SONGS Especially dos oruguitas
This is my favorite song in the whole movie. Listen to this song everyday at least 3 times 😅🤣. Also she’s doing tiktok dances at the ends lmao
Enchanto, is the best movie that Disney have ever made.. is full with kinda secret messages, and is simply amazing
At the beginning the animators were keeping her as she was but by the end they jad a steoke or something
Tristan: What happened to Bruno?  Me instantly: WR DONT TALK ABOUT BRUNO NO NO NO NO!!!😂😂
Tristan: what happened to Bruno? Me: we don't talk about bruno no no no
My fav song in Encanto..but my favorite scene would be where Mira went to see Isa to 'embrace' her... from the start all the way till the song ended. Hehe. Love Encanto !
I'm excited to see you upload We don't talk about bruno reaction
love that at the start u were like "shes probably not gonna sing, she doesnt have the voice for it", and then a bit over halfway through u exclaimed "OHHH she's a FANTASTIC vocalist"
every song is really good u should react 😭😭 i think isabela's what else can i do should come up next
6:51 sir excuse me? that was so good??
i love when u get sidetracked in ur reaction vids. those "wait pause i gotta look this VA up" mid song moments are golden
I really hope you react to "dos orguitas" its the one song no one actually physically sings but it's so beautiful. One of the most emotional songs.

Super love the movie and I hope you love it too Tristan!. After you’re done with Encanto, can you react to Andrew Garfield singing 30/90?
Omg the next song is Spoiler ;)
Tristan: what happened to Bruno?  Me, in moments: 🎶wE dOnT tAlK aBoUt BrUnO🎶
Favourite Disney song
I love Jess Darrow she's great on tik tok
I need the full movie reaction 🥺
Moreeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think this is the only song Mirabel doesn't feature on
You always have to watch Tristan's videos twice because you are guaranteed to hear something the second go around that you didn't hear the first time. Especially when he drops a lot of technical knowledge.  Not sure how I missed it the first go around but when I played it on the TV in the family room we all fell out laughing when Tristan said  "They're too busy partying with the goddamn rats and raccoons"  DEAD.
omg I've been waiting for this one !!!
I absolutely looveee this song 💞my girls can’t stop listening “Encanto soundtrack” all day , Please review “two oruguitas” it’s my second favorite 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
DOS ORUGUITAS NEXT PLEASE
you should react to "what else can I Do
10:25 sorry we dont talk about him
I know you already did “we don’t talk about bruno” but I’d love for you to talk about how camilo does the rasp/grit in his voice
REACT TO “ESPRESSO” BY TWICE PLSSSSS. THE VOCALS IN THAT SONG R JUST 🤌✨**Chefs kiss**
Have you heard the actress' natural speaking voice? It's kind of deep w/a richer tone, so I can imagine singing those notes isn't too difficult
In the song. We don’t talk about Bruno he is dancing at the top in between Dolores and mirabelle
Please DO NOT react to 'Dos Oruguitas' or 'All of You' until you see the full movie. They are the last songs for a good reason. They have MAJOR spoilers for the end of the film. If you want an authentic first view of the movie you can record your reaction to 'Dos Oruguitas' and 'All of You' while you watch the whole movie. Believe me, it is worth the wait!😄
Jessica gave her whole bu$$y performing this song this was incredible
JAJAJAJA. I love your reaction to everything: dance moves, movie context, singing techniques, and so on. Los grititos de sorpresa que haces gave meeee life. 😂😂😂
You should react to sing 2 too :( , scene when meena and alfonso sing "i say a little prayer" please
2:00 Tristan maybe you forgot but that isn't her room she didn't get a room that mean she doesn't have a miracle because the door disappear  And that's the nursery
I have been waiting for your reaction to this song!!
Please react to Sofia Carson - Loud.
I REALLY WANT HIM TO DO WHATELSE CAN I DO
Can you please react to Toxic by boywithuke
UHH doesn't work😌
React to tik tik boom
"What happened to bruno???"   Me: We DoNt TaLk AbOuT  bRuNo!
Tristan: bruno! whos bruno?  me: WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BRUNO!
Can I just say I've watched u for years now and though I was subscribed... Cus I get notifications💀😭 wtf is my ut broken or what 😂
Anybody else laugh when Luisa bear hugs Luisa? They just went over the top with the spine cracking lol. It was hilarious out of nowhere.
I love his hoa ?! Reaction when the first pressure like a tic tic part came 😂
I love how Luisa turns into “strong lady”
I've been waiting for this😍☺️
I love this song the most
You should react to dos oruguitas next
Please do the sing “What else can I do” Its a great song within the movie also!
You should react to jimmy fallon rita ora 🔥
It's my favourite soundtrack from the whole movie hehe
Yay! So good! 🥰🥰🥰 Also something to keep in mind along with the INCREDIBLY talented vocalists is that all the music is directed by Lin Manuel Miranda. Love hearing your take on everything!
Mirabel doesn't have her own room. She still sleeps in the family's Nursery, because the casita never gave her a room / the door disappeared when she was supposed to receive powers.
"This song is so good!" "Wow she's dance very well." "Wtf is happening?"
you should react to light switch by charlie puth, juss a good recommendation
Please react to The Weeknd’s new album!!!
wait how many rocks was she lifting?
please react to claire crosby's cover of this. Mind. Blowingly. Amazing
I love her voice so much gonna need her to sing me to sleep for real, yep I said it
I'm just waiting for the BRUNO reaction
YES I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO REACT TO THIS ONE 😁
He might not upload every song? Why? At least get to, "What Else Can I Do?" That’s my fav!
It's Jessica darrow it is her normal voice
FINALLYYYYYY
You should watch tick tick boom and react to Andrew Garfield sing!!
How about Abuela making Maribel think she was crazy for seeing the cracks and She knew about them all along. Forget saving the miracle, Abuela acted like Maribel made that up.🤦🏾‍♀
I don't care what anyone says about the other songs, they are great , but this one made me FEEL things. It then wraps up all the feelings you have with an absolute bop to jam with. I love this song.
This was my favorite song from Encanto, it was definitely the most catchy and most relatable.
Can you please react to Loyal Brave True from Mulan? Anyway I love this video especially Luisa's part is amazing
I can't stop laughing at 4:01 🤣🤣
Those have to be the monsters inc doors !
10:27 "We Don't Talk About Bruno..."
The "what the fuck" made me laugh SO HARD
The only thing I can seem to focus on is the background nosies they add it’s so interesting I’ve never really noticed anything like it in other Disney songs
ive heard that voice actress real voice and its just like that .. its her real tone
My new favorite disney movie encanto
Yayyy I’m so happy when alll the songs are in the playlist!!!
“I bet she doesn’t sing” …starts singing 😂
4:02 Just cuz you can lift heavy rocks doesn't mean you can sing girl  LOL
This makes me excited for the next song since you've already done We Don't Talk about Bruno! But it would be cool to know what you think about it having seen the movie that comes before the song.
'Somewhere in italy: silenzio bruno'     Quoted
Love love love these!!!!!!!
Please upload every song reaction from the movie!
React to Selena q. day 5 disco melody
1:56 Nah that’s a good point I’d ask casita to give me another floor if I was Mirabel
I love how you were extremely critical and sceptical about this song and the character and her voice actress singing... and then you fell for it just like everyone else. Love this song!
I really hope you'll post all of the songs honestly 🤣 I'm excited for Isabela's!!!
Love this! You should do some videos on sing and sing2!
the lyrics of this song have got to be my fav part, "give it to your sister and never wonder if the same pressure would've pulled you under" and "give it to your sister it doesn't hurt and see if she can handle every family burden, watch as she fumbles and bends but never breaks" those 2 lines just break me
Been waiting for this since the first reaction
This is in my top three songs of the movie and I love how you really go into the pitch and background into what makes her sound so interesting for this character. But is no one going to talk about that jazz cover the voice actress did? Tristan you NEED to make a video reacting to it!
5:20 eNcAnTo StRoNg LaDy, btw Tristan you're a really good singer nice run there also
@Tristan Paredes,  I think the difference in voice because Luisa is putting up an act.  The pressure IS getting to her, but she's doing her best to give off a "everything is fine vibe."    Everyone in the family is lying, and that's the problem that needs to be unmasked.  Until everyone realizes this, and deals with it, the home is in trouble.
So what else can I do!
WE DONT TALK ABOUT BRUNO ! ....DONT ASK WHO HE IS! ...lol this song and brunos song is my faaave 🥲🥰🥰
Why did you say the F word that’s a bad word I’m just going to dislike video
2:57 can we appreciate that they both had the same reaction and even blinked at the same time
When I try to sing the lyrics “it doesn’t hurt and see if she can handle every family burden” I tear up every time. Such a powerful song
please please please listen to the english version of dos oruguitas and compare the two! I love both and I really wanna hear from you if the different words change the vibe for you at all?
Please please do a video with “What else can I do?” ❤️❤️❤️ I think it’s being under-appreciated and it’s so insanely beautiful. Described by Lin as a Latino rock ballad from the 90s 😍
The spanish version is so much better! You should listen it too
I’ve been so excited for this one
I would watch you react and analyze the Jessica Darrow jazz cover ❤️ im intrigued
Hey! You should react to the Spanish version. It is as good as this one. If not better...
It's jessica's natural voice range though
“Why does she dance so well”. Umm are we not gonna talk about the donkeys? They’re literally getting it. 😂😂 can’t wait to you react to what else can I do
Not only is this song a stylistic masterpiece that tickles my every onomatopoeia need, it does a phenomenal job at representing all the older sisters of latina households. I can't help but cry each time I hear it... "give it your sister your sister's stronger... see if she can handle every family burden." Like damn, Disney didn't have to come for our deep rooted trauma like that lol.
I think the reason why Mirabel saw the house breaking is because she at this point in time felt broken apart from the family which became even stronger
DO WHAT ELSE CAN I DO PLS
JuSt CaUsE yOu CaN LiFt ROcKs DosN’t mEaN YOu CAn SinG GurL
aaaaaa loved your reaction
yes... finally i can be at peace
actually tristan's reactions are better than the movie 🤣🤣 tristan : AHHHHHHH BRUNO  me : IKRRRRRRRR 🤣🤣
I can’t wait to see his reaction to ‘what else can I do’
I had this song on loop everyday:))) so addicting
you should react to andrew garfields singing in "tick, tick... boom!" on netflix!!
I was wanting for this one
I love how Louisa spends the entire song protecting her sister. Also that the moment Mirabel started to look genuinely worried for Louisa, she changed her tone, started dancing and seemed to be trying to reassure Mirabel that she could handle it.
Him: who's brouno?  Me who hasn't even seen the movie: we don't talk about bruno!
Can we please get some Mariah Carey reactions from the past two years please!!!!
im so happy you got to hear the song!!! loved the reaction so much
I love you calling out that she uses her voice in a way to make it sound almost like 2 different characters. She is portraying that in the song that she's strong but also she's almost crippled by this pressure. Very cool!
So glad you liked this one, i knew you would freak when you heard her deep ass voice contrasted with her voice when she sings drip drip drip tip tip tip grip grip and even more so with the shake this crushing weight of expectations lyric. She's super talented.
Oh please EVERY song! please do every song!!
Can you do “Dos Oruguitas” from ENCANTO Too 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😭
This is my fave song from the movie and also cos I relate to it haha
Me and my friend we’re joking while we we’re watching this movie in class and he literally screamed, “MOANA! and Maui” and everyone just bursted out laughing and he got detention lmao
We dont talk about bruno next!!! my fave song
DOS ORUGUITAS PLEASEEEE
omg early
Please do What Else Can I Do
Tristan: Who's Bruno Everybody: We don't talk about Bruno!
When are you doing All of you ?
I have been waiting for this!!! amazing!
Bruno is her uncle! I thibk that tio means uncle in Spanish (pls correct me of I am wrong.) They don't talk about Bruno beacuse they think he brings bad luck. But they do like to sing about Bruno
Lol you had such little faith in this song from the beginning and now it's your favorite
Tristan: What happened to Bruno!!!??  Me: WE DONT TALK ABOUT BRUNO NO NO NO!!!!!!🤫
Wow.Jessica Darrow is excellent and talented. Very interesting.:-O;-):-D
The Spanish voices are better at singing. Sue me
Movie: says that bruno is an uncle and brother Tristan: who's bruno
You should do a full video reaction of Jessica Darrow  jazz cover version
“Who’s Bruno?”  WE DONT TALK ABOUT BRUNO!
...and to think, Jessica Darrow is 5'-5" and maybe 100lbs soaking wet! So talented!
We want everything, every single song xD. I speak for everyone here I assume there's no objections?
I may have some unresolved family issues because I can’t listen to this song without actually crying 🥲😅
You didnt react to the "The magic is S T RO N G"
i miss your reactions to camila. she’s done a lot of performances lately you should check her out again ! maybe her tiny desk or good 4 u cover
This is the best song from the whole movie.
When I have a bad hair day I just watch Tristan and see his messy hair to make me feel better 🥲
i watched your "i had a little bit of a run there" ten times and laughed so hard lol
i haven't historically been a massive Claire Crosby fan, but she sung this song and it's actually amazing, would love to hear your reaction to it.
💙
this is one of my favorite, not only because of the singers absolute annihilation, but because of the lyrics. lin manuel miranda really put his whole linussy into this song.
Me, yelling at the video when Tristan said her room is janky : SHE DIDN'T GET A ROOM!
I woke up being blessed by Tristan
I LOVEEE ENCANTOO 💞❤✨😻
I’m only a little bit upset that you skipped the part we’re Camilo is Dolores- only a little bit :,)
I was waiting on this video. I love this song. It is my favorite song from the film.
You should react to Clare Crosby's cover of this song! 9 years old and she can do the whole range!
Her room is the “nursery”… she would have gotten her own room if her door didn’t disappear
i found this channel yesterday and yesss im here for it
Tristans comedy is the literal reason I subscribed 😩
Not encanto related but PLEASE REACT TO JOEY BATEY IN THE WITCHER - specifically ‘Burn Butcher burn’ , something tells me you’d really like his voice !!
Yes, I’m loving this series!
Now I know why this is my favorite song, because it’s the most technically dynamic out of all the single voices. Also I high key relate lol
Day 267 of requesting a Billy Raffoul song (for example: You Be Love (acoustic), I’m Not a Saint (acoustic), The Ballad of James Howlett, Hell or High Water, etc...) he has a very unique voice and I think u would like it.
Love this song! It was stuck in my head for weeks! I had to make a lesson for my students analyzing the song and looking for figurative language lol
Stop pausing
I'm your biggest fan
This is my personal favorite song!! Couldn't wait to see you react to it, I love when it gets to that little slow dreamy part of the song
eeek I love this reaction!
As a person with the same talking and singing range of Luisa, I wouldn’t say it’s hard. You just need to keep practicing transitions and it’s fine. It’s not like a put on voice many alto or low female voices have that kind of range
loving these!
She is amazing 🤗
id love to see your reaction meeting bruno🤣
I'd love it if you could upload a second reaction to we don't talk about Bruno. I'm interested to hear what you think now that you have all the context for the story and know the characters and their powers a little bit better. I'm also interested to see if you caught any easter eggs listening to/watching it a second time ;)
This is my favorite song in the whole movie. I love all the others as well but its so beautiful
The way she sings in the song makes it so much more relatable.
Yasss I love this song, been waiting for you to react to it!
She doesn’t have a room because she was never given a door, so she lives in the nursery which is where Antonio was until he got his door
I just found out about you through your reaction to Bruno and was looking for you to react to this song before you posted it lol.
My favorite from the movie💗
MORE MORE MORE MORE!!!
We don’t talk about Bruno no no no no
This song gives me chills, especially the line, "Give it to your sister it doesn't hurt and/ See if she can handle every family burden!" This movie may have rushed the plot, but the songs CARRIED this movie
Dang bro you added the we don’t talk about Bruno so out of context like it doesn’t match the rest of your videos cause you’re so confuse
LMFAO 9:16
FUCKING FINALLY!!! Every vocal coach I’ve seen talk about this song NEVER dive into the technicality of her tone! I just wanted ONE person to analyze it in a way that goes beyond, “this sounds cool, she sounds tough”. Thank you for being the one to do that while providing fantastic facial expressions.
Lowkey this song is better than we don't talk about Bruno - I'm sorry but the singer's talent PLUS the amazing lyrics, melody and MEANING - literally perfecto!
YES SOMEONE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE JAZZ COVER I've seen like no one talking about that video and it blows my mind because she sounds absolutely fantastic and everyone loves Luisa and Surface Pressure
Def upload ur reaction to Isabelas song!
your videos are so entertaining lmaoo
The worst fkn song ever released bydisney
I’ve listened to this song at least 50 times already. And I am obsessed with Luisa
“This song is amazing… da fuq😀”
U listen this anime movie called Belle the song very good both English and Japanese
So excited with every post!! Thanks for doing these Encanto songs!
You should definitely react to annapantsu if you are willing, she has an amazing voice and her range is admirable. I personally really like heart of stone but that may be a bit too chill so the classic annapantsu suggestion would be hell fire (The original she did when she was 16 but has done a more updated version in 2019)
Marabel was chosen by Casita ie the house. Also.. Louisa is a boss bitch and i die on this cross
Yeah about that "can't sing with an open throat" thing? Some do and it sounds amazing if done right. Diana Ankudinova immediately comes to mind, and if you want to check her out her Wicked Game was when she was 14/15 and is hauntingly good imo (there's more, of course, but that's a good starter. Her latest is Personal Jesus if you want to jump to recent stuff for the views)
The next video is gonna be we dont talk about bruno aarrgghhhh i'm so excited 😆
Yes, i'm happy you realized a video about this song, my fav among all
Omg 😂 3:00. Same exact expression, right down to blinking at the same time, I can’t 💀
Tristan: NO mistakes. Also Tristan: POV: Ohh I am very satisfied with myself rn Tristan again: I am usually not good at growl Still Tristan: yeah imma do it again cause I’m awesome  Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t wait for Isabella’s song
tristan: what happened to bruno? me: we don't talk about bruno no no nooo
I’ve already watched the movie 12 times but I’m still watching for your reaction 😭
Love hearing alto voices in Disney movies!
I think it has to do with the fact that she's literally breaking and becoming weak for all the weight the family and expectations are putting on her. So she's trying to be strong (the deep voice) and when she talks about it being too much and she's breaking (the lighter voice comes in plays).  Vocally and metaphorically is very well displayed. It gives me shivers!
Just wait for we don't talk about Bruno
I was waiting for this reaction 💀
Surface pressure is one of my favorite disney aongs
WHY DOES SHE DANCE SO WELL BC SHES A TIKTOK DANCER
Yeeeessss was waiting for this one!
I'm so happy to see this reaction....I adore this song!
Was looking forward to this one!
Who's Bruno? We don't talk about Bruno.. Nono
Heu will u please check out brittany morris singing on youtube and tik tok, she practices continuously singing but she never had any training, she needs ur help! Shes my gf and shes pretty good!
This is the one I was waiting for!!! ❤️❤️❤️
this song always makes me cry lmao
My two year old son is obsessed with this song. I love that he has strong positive female examples.
Is it just me or it sounds a bit similar to the songs in Hamilton
Not gonna lie, she should be a TikTok dancer
We Don't Talk About Bruno is obviously the big fan favorite and it's a great song, but Surface Pressure definitely takes the spot for my personal favorite song in this movie.
Patiently waiting for Dos Oruguitas 🤗
Welcome to the FIRE that is ENCANTO!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've been WAITING for this one
When she says whata wha-wha-what!? It’s so funny 😂 and when it gets to the chorus of 8:24 it’s so sad 😭 the little light in her eye and the sadness it really shows how much she struggles.
I was waiting for this since he reacted to we dont talk about bruno
Watching e canto the first time o loved it didn’t really like the songs but after watching it a couple times I got OBSESSED and I would like to say thank you for feeding my new obsession.
Dos Oruguitas? 🐛 🐛
React to Dos oruguitas from Encanto pls♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️
can u react to hamilton
tristan, im begging you to react to claire crosby's cover of this song! shes 9 years old and incredible! youll love it!
You should also react to "Dos Oruguitas" by Sebastián Yatra which is the song that plays when Abuela is explaining her story to Mirabel   Something about that song combined with the scenes that play from Abuela's Backstory just tugs at your heart and I love it
Jessica Darrow effing RAWKS. And this may be what kicks her from a solid performer to a big time celebrity. :D
Yay finally!
Now do “what else can i do”
Will you re-react to We Don't Talk About Bruno?
I felt like it was interesting that she tends to use her upper range, or more feminine singing voice, when she’s saying something vulnerable in the song. So even though she’s switching from the “character” voice, it’s still telling you something about the character. It’s her softer side coming out.
So im not the only one who thought this was weird.... 9:15
“They’re too busy partying with the god damn rats and raccoons” who hurt you? You sound so short tempered and angry.   And she didn’t get a room so she sleeps in the nursery.
I sing a little like her but i'm bad at it. I woudl like to know what type of singer I am someday.
can you react to 30/90 by the tick tick boom movie?
We don't talk about Bruno!!! (Currently #1 in the UK singles chart!!)
Pleeaaase do dos orugitas</3
❤️
FINALLYYYY
I really can't wait for him to see Isa's song, it's one of my favorites too
Yay this is the one encanto reaction I was interested in.
I LOVE this reactions so much 🥰
I’ve been waiting for this moment
Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We don't talk about Bruno bro.
The video I’ve been waiting for
Sorry for ask again but PLEASE REACT TO BELLA TAYLOR SMITH ON "THE VOICE AUSTRALIA" , at least her blind audition and duet with her coach. She is amazing!!!!!!
Please react to Katy Perry’s new edm/dance single „When I’m Gone”! There is also a music video!
9:39 same here lol... And like omg finally 😍 I've been waiting for your reaction to Surface Pressure 😊💯
Definitely the song I relate the most to! <3
I know you already uploaded a reaction to “We don’t talk about Bruno” but I’d love to see your reaction now that you’ve seen some of the movie
surface pressure is the best song in encanto im my opinion
You should react “in the heights” it’s by Lin Manuel Miranda and it has the voice actor for Mirabel as well
I can't wait for you to get to the song "We don't talk about Bruno"
I actually like this song more than 'We Don't Talk About Bruno' just because of the message. The Bruno song is really amazing in how it was made, but the lyrics of this song and the look on Luisa's face gives me chills and almost makes me cry every single time
I'm sorry, it's so amazing that you have reacted to this fantastic addictive song, which I can't stop listening and singing to but your growl sounds lowkey like a burp, that made me laugh. Great content 😋😂
I toldddddd youuuuuu Tristan!! Best song of the movie hands down!
THANK YOU!   You've just defined my problem, and so well. I've got a naturally deep voice, and well....it's not always the best for conveying inflection and tone. Intimidating? Sure. It's my greatest weapon. Seduction? People's minds go to the gutter when I say hello.   My social anxiety disorder loves the attention. Really.   So to sound normal...ish...I might have, sort of, totally ripped off a friend's higher vocal patterns? Because, obviously, that's a normal thing to do.  But it worked!   Kind of.  It confuses a lot of people. Who has two voices?   I had no idea why I still do it, until just now, when you broke it down. o.o  Subscribed.
10:26 he wouldn’t know who Bruno is because they don’t talk about Bruno 😂
Why does this song make me tear up everytime? It's not even that sad...lol
Please, react to "la reina"! Its Christina's new Spanish song and the vocals are amazing!!
I need to see your reaction to Bruno 😂
Literally my favorite song in Encanto. I relate so much to Luisa when it comes to family burdens. Love this!!
I love this song so much!!!!
After Encanto, you should do a Tick Tick Boom reaction
Tristan you need to react to "Dos Oruguitas" its so sad
Please do dos oroguitas!! It’s my favourite song 😭
Tristan should rate the songs after or give his opinions about them 😆
“Tío Bruno” means uncle Bruno :) he is their uncle
Why did you didn’t react to Dawn fm !!!😩
first 4 sings - best 4 songs PREIODT fight me
Its so relatable when I first saw/heard this scene I cried
Watching you react to encanto is my new favorite thing!! Can't wait for the next one 💕
"This song is amazing the fuck'' 🖐🏻😭
Yes yes this is my favorite song from the movie
YES THIS SONG IS AMAZING  Finally you listen and agree hahaha
I love this song so much! Almost a little bit more than “We don’t talk about Bruno” just because it has such a deep meaning.
i was gonna go to sleep but i needed to watch this masterpiece first. 😫💅
IT'S THE BEST SONG IN THE WHOLE MOVIE!!!!!
:)
I started crying as you were reacting to this song because I wanted you to like it so bad. 🥺 and I’m glad you did. ❤️❤️❤️
4:49 I loove to see people reacting to this part of the song is always so relatable hahaha, what a bop
I love your videos sooo much!!
My favorite song from this movie ! 🥰😍
Luisa says "I'm as tough as the crust of the earth". The crust is the thinnest outermost layer meaning it is just a facade she puts on.
man I loved these!
I'm from Colombia
Fun fact: Mirabel sounds a lot like Miracle and Madrigal sounds a lot like magical ;D the Madrigal family = the Magical family
I love this. The song is great.Also Tristan being upset about Mirabel's room is just priceless 🤣
You only got like 3 more songs and you allready reviewed we don’t talk about bruno so you good haha
Isn’t this song such a great, unexpected surprise?! Thanks for reacting to it.😉
love how much this song allows her vocal range to build and expand. I thought I wasn't gonna be too crazy about this song when it started with the rapping and less variation, but I think the build up to the more powerful belts and strong vocals played into the style really well. also provided a great parallel to the building pressure she's discussing and really showed off her character. it's my favorite song from the movie
Can't wait for Tristan to see the ending song, it heals my broken heart from this movie
Hey Tristan, once you finish with your Encanto reactions, you should react to Katy Perry's "When I'm Gone"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should react to Claire Crosby she is 9yrs old and such a good singer!
Jessica Darrow made a jazz version of this song. You can check it out.
Please react to dos oruguitas!!
react to vivo pls
She has a Jazz Version
Why do they all have to sing?
your musical opinion is the only one that matter. and queen cat of course
My husband said this song is superior in the film and I personally agree although all the songs are fantastic!
You've no clue how glad I am to see this video up. xD I was searching for it an hour ago and nada. But now! Buahaha. Nice. Thanks!
8:15 this part hits different
So excited!!  It's kinda sad that my fav song is the last one but still excited
I’ve been waiting for this one! As a vocalist and voice teacher, I watched this and was like ‘hmm! I wonder what Tristan would say about this!’ Lol
Did you just ask "Who's Bruno?"?!?...........shhhhhh, we don't talk about Bruno! 🤐😆
I think there's something about how much the singer changes up the vocals in this particular song's message. It's about the pressure if you can't always be one thing and we're multi-faceted humans who all deal with vulnerable emotions, even the most strong, resilient people.
Yes!!!!!
Well now you have to react to We Dont Talk About Bruno if you wanna know who he is
i'm so sad i didn't get to see his reaction to Luisa saying " so I've been picking up all the donkeys " because in my opinion that was one of the funniest bits.
Can't wait for u to react to what else can i do
Every time Tristan said 'oh this is good' I kept thinking...oh just you wait! Best song.
I love this song
This is the best song in the movie IMO. I love this one ❤️
im one of those people who cries every time I listen to this song, the lyrics just break me :(
The fact you commented on why she dances so well makes me laugh because that was my initial reaction too 😂😂😂
Lin Manuel Miranda is an absolute genius ! Best Disney movie to date.
PLEASE REACT TO WHAT ELSE CAN I DO :')
I've been waiting for this one!!! It's so amazing seeing a strong female character that kids can look up to
just because u can lift heavy rocks those not mean u can sing girl🤣🤣🤣 lol
1st you absolutely MUST watch the movie and 2nd you should do Dos Oruguitas from this movie it's amazing
It would be great if you reacted to the Spanish versions as well
Can’t wait for you to listen to ‘What else can I do’
React to Aespa please
If it makes your day better, my service pup (the one in my profile picture) reacted nearly identical to you in near parallel to you reacting to the growl in the middle of this one. That was hard to write clearly. Lol.  As soon as you popped with excitement to the singer's growl in the middle, my pup popped up tail wagging up to the TV with similar joyus prosper.
This is the one I have been looking forward too
React to Athletic Girl by Hi-Key
React to Eleven by IVE
React to Wa Da Da by Kep1er
This is my fav song of the movie :)
React to more kpop
Patiently waiting for What Else Can I Do
i'm so happy you are watching this movie , i absolutely adore this entire film.
I'm pretty sure she talks like that Naturally.... Rightt??
I knew Encanto was going to be one of my favorite when I saw the trailer and it said “from the studio that brought you Moana”.   Seriously everyone in this movie is so talented! And glad some of them (most?) are Colombian.
Man, why nobody's talking about your posture? I'm bent like a pretzel here and you always sit so straight it gives me SHAME, well kudos to you, Trist
10:26 ... we don't talk about Bruno ! 😬😬
i am living for these reactions to encanto
Wait I'm Axiently early!
Luv ur stuff bro I subbed
React to it again. The second time it hits you different!!!!!!!!!
I love Surface Pressure so much. As the oldest of 7 siblings I relate so much to what Luisa is singing about. Feeling like you have to be strong for others 😫
Full Encanto movie playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAbUq4-ByhQ47aLyZVe3MO4pfHeBRQQfh
just hit top 10 on the hot 100!!
she actually talk like that
Yessss been waiting for this one! Can't stop listening to it.
"Just because you can lift heavy rocks doesn't mean you can sing girl" 😂 Love this vid
you can hear it with all songs, but especially this one that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it 😅
Why did the character remind me of Toff from Avatar the Last Airbender and then a Super Saiyan when she broke out of the yellow box and started running 😂
I have been waiting for this video. Thank you for making this
3:22 THIS KILLED ME
React to Tick Tick Boom!!!
The lyrics hit hard when you relate to it so much 😭
I love how you’ve gotten addicted to encanto! Don’t worry I’m addicted too 😂🤣
REACT TO “WHAT ELSE CAN I DO” from encanto
I so relate to this song being an older sister myself 😪
Yesss! I’ve been waiting for your reaction to this song!
Legit just was looking for this reaction and boom there it is, this song exceeded my expectations. The 'drip drip drip' sounds so pop like and I love the modern style disney chose for this movie.
I love watching reactions to Encanto songs!!! ♥️♥️♥️
Ok dude i rlly don't wanna be offencive here but- Are you small or is that sofa extreamly tall-
I always think this song sounds SO much like an Escape The Fate song idk what it is.. LOVE this movie way too much 🥲
EARLY BAE
AYYYYY
Mirabel power is to understand people feelings creating soul back into the house. She may not have gift but her gift is to help everyone .
BEEN WAITING ON THIS SONG
Never watched encanto but I’m here for Tristan watching the song reactions, he’s iconic💕💕
I’ve been waiting for you to review this one! It’s my favourite 🤩
FINALLY i have been waiting for this one
Ahh yes please react to Jessica’s Cover 😭👏
BEST SONG
My fav tbh
React to dos orugitas
3:00 you and mirabel having the same exact reaction is killing me😂😂😂
Hello, I am Colombian and I would really like you to also react to some songs in Spanish. i love your channel❤
When you haven’t watched the movie but know the movie 😭 :
Yesss I was waiting for you to react
:D
Tristan asking "whos bruno" like he doesn't know that we don't talk about him
Best song in the whole movie!
Tristan if there is something i could do other then subscribe watch like bell share and patreon i would because i love these Encanto vids
My favourite one is “What else can I do” cause it’s just so beautiful!!
i’m so in love with luisa, it’s not even funny
The more you listen to Surface Pressure, the better it gets! I have it on loop daily and I still get goosebumps every single time!
This song is fr in my top 3 favorites 😂
Please do dos oruguitas
What a masterpiece!
It’s crazy to think that the girl who voices her is Rosa from Brooklyn 99
Watch dos oracaos and what else can I do
Here for the growls!
i'm so obsessed with this song, it always makes me cry for how much i can relate to it
Lin Manuel Miranda truly seved last year :)
Something about this song makes me so dang emotional!! I can’t help but cry!
ANOTHER ONE YESSS
I can’t wait until he reacts to dos oruguitas
The best song of the whole movie!!!! She does so good!!!
Watching people watch Encanto for the first time is a literal joy
I can't even growl to save my own life and this singer seems to do it so easily, it's veeeeery satisfying
“JuSt BeCaUsE yOu CaN lIfT hEaVy RoCkS doEsNt MeAn YoU cAn SiNg GuRl” is probably my new favorite quote ever
Wow iam finally early 🤧👏
Never clicked so fast before 😂
Early gang 💯🔥
Early
Bye im going to watch to movie🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
Can you please react to dos orugitas
She doesn’t have a super cool big room because she didn’t get her door. She had to stay in the nursery because her Magic didn’t awaken and give her her own room.
Ngl I don't like Abuela even though they make her nicer in the end I still don't like Abuela
6:55 lmaooooo tristan you’re feeling yourself this episode (as you shouldddd)
The room is the nursery that the children stay in until they get their powers (which comes with a room),so Mirabel never got her own room, which is also why Casita can still interact with her in her bedroom.
Will you do a reaction to We Don’t Talk About Bruno with context of what’s happening
Hi, please can you react to Como Nossos Pais by Elis Regina, I’m a Brazilian fan and it would be super cool if you did a video listening to a Brazilian singer. ❤️❤️❤️
This is laterally the best songgg
Early again, this is one of my fave songs in Encanto, next to What Else Can I do❤️
I legit listen to this song at least once a day! This is a masterpiece of a song, the best one besides “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” in my opinion. Disney did a phenomenal job with Encanto.
Hello 👋🏼
