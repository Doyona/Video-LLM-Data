Nahh cuz why did I get a mc add before this
Then you just like the shuker shoot you up
Bruh him waiting hours for a wandering trader to spawn even though they despawn after like 15 minutes no matter what 😂
I'm already subscribed!
Couldn't you make a staircase from the void base to above eorld by stacking many minecarts? Like one line with i.e. 100 minecarts, another one with 99, etc, you can just press minecart to go higher, until you're above ground, right?
you copyed mysticat😒
Most dump person in Minecraft 17:07
So that's missing 11:17 good talking
Bruh that looks like anything but a Base
Was that a glow squid? 16:13

3:13 what sound is that it sounds nostalgic :,) and i just can’t remember from where i heard it
Soy el único q no habla inglés aquí?

Bro your voice has changed so much
I hate that everyone keeps screaming clickbait over a single fucking villager
El audio en español era horrible, no sabía que era automático 😢, y pensar que por eso me negaba a ver los video de este youtuber

I thought that my red stone base was cool 😢
how can a person be so smart
IT DOES NOT HAVE A BED SO ITS NOT A BASE

You should not use your arrow to get out of your base because if u fall in the void u cant tp back
What the f@ck
Que buen video, no me imagino la tortura que fue hacer eso xD
Happy Ghast

Champivaca
sorry  to say guys but this guy's a fraud, even though i love his videos... look at 11:03, we see a quick image when he's in creative
Como
Who’s in 2026
He could've built a staircase up with boats, or a stack of minecarts to spam right click
4:42 what is this joke my friend ??? my heart has fallen😂
Copiou o tonigon
When u want a wandering trader I doesn't  come but when u don't need him he comes😂with 😂😂😂
Bed?
9:27  I thought you put the mine carts in the void with nothing at the bottom
throwing the elytra to void really got me
VOID 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
At this point it surpries me that this man havent done a wood making farm I have seen all his videos and in almost evry vidio he is choping entire forest for his builds
Alguien más se dio cuenta de que tiene voz como de Mi villano favorito
8:28 have yo heard of boat with chest
🇧🇷
7:55 they don't   Moo ve
(Its a wandering trader)
I found one close to my base
Just generate your world in an old version before they added the deep dark and update, then you have an area below the world that's buildable, like you can on the nether roof.  I'm sure that has no downsides that I haven't thought of at all.
i love your videos even if they are 5 years ago
Se le olvido ponerle nombre a los shulkers pues despawnearan
1:57 2:14
Me gustaría que me dieras clases me llamó Diego y vivi en Sevilla
E
0:15 "shelkers"
Come on bro, you made it the best base
y no era mejor 1 cubeta de agua y estar por debajo y ir tirando bloque desde arriba ya que vuela como quien dice con el agua y ba bajanado o construyendo
es una champivaca
I just wonder one thing after place box cant you just drop the sand /gravel?
En realidad se llaman Champivaca y es Elytra no Elaytra a un se dice experiencia no XP significa lo mismo pero los jugadores de Minecraft le dicen experiencia
it's in survival liar NOT IN HARCODE :l
Was that lose control at 9:46?
U did not upload in 1 month.
Hey literally u don’t have a bed. So no base! I mean like idk
8:51 ¿Y las mulas?
0:50😂
Why Minecraft a boat a lot better I hate you
"im gonna need a lot of wood for the boat" You really only need 3 stacks And i know you atleast have some automatic wood farm Its kinda useless to show the timelapse when you can just build an automatic wood farm not to mention you also may have a lot of wood from previous projects so Whats the point of the forest timelapse?
Who keeps on joining his world?
The ocd of him dropping the elytra is wild😅😅
Did bro get rid of his elytra when it took me hours to get one😭😭
Why can I listen to this guy for hours…😂😂
im here because of tiktok
He is constantly switching between saying shulkers and shelkers
Don't be surprised if the wandering trader despawns because it is an unobtainable mob and therefore will despawn even if you put a name tag on it or put it in a boat or minecart :(. Same goes for the trader llamas
5:41 Just use a riptide trident + ender pearl
yo comi caca
Your my fav youtuber
Podrias usar plangas trepadoras para subir y bajar como escaleras de mano

Hi is cool
Tus videos son muy buenos x Carvs😁😁
Ender pearls don’t work!!!!
Oh no 🙈
Ignore the people saying you need a bed to make a base. A base is a base is a base is a base, and not everyone sleeps, or sets spawn.
15:13 Wandering villager ??
ShElKeRs and chests
0:10 queeeeeeeeeeeee
8:00 its cuz they are shouldnt be there... (i think) 10:35 no cuz there's no bed
13:00 /location😊
13:51 pig trickshot 💀💀💀
What?
Love this guy 😂
bro has every type of base
Villagers need bed to start the raid.
bro did it in survival
bros wandering trader despawned and he just acted like it didnt (wandering traders cant be made to not despawn)
8:38 i love how much space llamas have 😂😂
It’s not a base cause it doesn’t have walls or a roof
0:15  the “oh my gosh” is really funny if u play it at 0.25 speed
Dá até vontade de voltar a jogar Mine só vendo os vídeos desse cara ^^
Tambien se puede hacer un mundi plano en la 1.17 y pasarlo a la 1.18 para poder construir debajo
ahem, bed?
Bro said llamas had 3 slots and then called the donkey a llama 😂🤣
11:03  I thought this was real, but he has been in creative, this one frame snitched on him lol
you only have 25 vids 😢😢😢😢😢
here on 2025 his voice sounds so different
Alternative title: minecraft base but i can only use entities
Bro is Sentry 😅
I don’t understand why he couldn’t just shift click build a layer on top of the shulker boxes??
1:57 A Loser Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid
Soy el único que habla español😮😮
Que void el video👀👀👀👀
Does sand help instead of boats?
2:28 - instantly subscribed for this, omg.

I feel Scammed, where is the bed ?
5:40  Five Minecraft years later that enderpear teleports him to the ðŵăžþß dimension
Ñy7
14:47
Bro is building a zoo in the void not a base😂😂😂
uy que void esa casa 👀👀👀👀
would have been faster to just make a single hole, put a bed nearby a box with a bunch of trash blocks to place and then jump in the hole while looking up and pillar your way down, build the platform off of that, remove the pillar then voila! instant void base and you can build it out and add on to it.
Bro pensé que sería como la miniatura.. me siento estafado
Damn someone took this "FULL VIDEO" and upload it on Facebook reel without credit. Luckily i watched almost full video just to know you make it and damn this video is kinda old🗿
Click bait.
😢alguien de México 😢😢😢   🇲🇽

With the villagers down there to trade, theyll never restock without their job blocks :( also wandering trader will despawn after 2 days
8:42 you called the donkey a llama
Y yo creyendo que sabía de minecraft 💀
is using creative 11:03
Bro has 100 accuracy
Not him walking past the wandering trader like 3 times in a row 😂
Eres genial bro ❤🎉
how did you survive the ender pearl dropping into the void?
For a raid you need a villager and a bed that’s why it didn’t work
(8:37) He called a donkey a llama
Es apto para sensibles👀👀👀

Void 👀
Just swear.
Not sure if this is meant to be satirical or it’s just misleading
Holaaa
You could have used the shulkers to get back up(I’m halfway through the video)
2:14 stupid stupid 😂😂
Is it crazy that 1:01 sounds like the ooh iee ahh meme
17:12 Are you sure about that?
Why not use boats for the vertical movement inside the base
How do people even do this
how are you going to sleep in the void
Yo me pongo creativo y cojo 100k diamante rompiebel record🗿
So many ads very smart man
No bed no base
8:00 mobs can only walk to a tagert bl9ck.. in the void there is no blocks so yeah
before 5M↓↓↓
If you had just waited 2 years this whole thing could've been a lot easier
6:23 diamond
Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Turn to Him and repent before it's too late.
Llama? 8:43
Ooooh my gi ash
8:41 "llama"
nvm
couldn't you just put the shulkers in the outline of the floor and not the full floor?
I subscribed and liked and turned all notifications on on your YouTube channel
Why not just use water?
get a gf loser
9:22 I appreciate that the dirt breaking was in sync with the music 😭
Ok wild question. If you placed chest carts first then hopper carts would they funnel into the chests?
I love how it matches with the music 9:21
its because of the fact that the chickens are holding up the boats, cows werent designed to stand on mobs (ofc) so they didnt make movement on that block.
Why do you keep saying Shelker instead of Shulker 😅
There no bed
What if he accidentally  pushes a stack of chest carts off and loses all his stuff
cool
This is might be the prologue of parkour civilisation
14:46 an unemployed guy😂

But do you use the bases that you built?😊😊
nivel de al pedizmo  3mil
I wonder if you could, irrespective of if fast or slow, use flying machines to push blocks down so you don't need to worry about accidentally breaking a boat, or something along those lines, among other possible things?
Water?
mejor me void👀
Anyone here in 2025?
I was thinking the way you're speaking is so forced it's funny, but then I realised it was dubbed LOL
Aute sí pudo

MOOSHROOM
Cow: WHAT DID I DO 9:55
After he’s done does he just leave the base forever
Hm
I am your biggest fan plz give some robux

I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME -PHILIPPIANS 4:13 <3
8:31 Those are *six* slots, and you kept making the same mistake through the video.
You didn't have to add a ender pearl stasis chamber you could have just stacked up boats and get into them over and over and over
Carvs cuando bas a mostrar tu cara real
Cómo APIXELADOS
can't he build down from anoter block that will start from above the void and extend it into the void and later just open the now closed passaga again? btw I don't play minecraft and have rudamentary knowleage of building stuff.

13:50 XD
Waos
First, remove the shulkers ability to shoot you. Then, debate on methods of how to get back up.  *Shulkers in the background trying to levitate you except they can't cos you blocked them*
If you can't get up then why would you throw your extra and firework?
11:03 bro is in creative for a split second
Estuve desde el inicio??
Где смотреть видео Carvs на русском?  Where can I watch Carvs videos in Russian?
Since you built so many bases, do you give them to other players in exchange for materials or ores?
What's the version
Wow😂
Eso debería ser ilegal en Minecraft
0:34 what is that sound from

Honest question: wouldn't be easier to "glue" a block to the ceiling of the cave, then keep placing block downwards to create a column, and then use that column to spread a floor just above the layer where the skulks and boats are floating? Or am I missing something, as in the void instantly breaking any block or something?
So... No bed, no farm, no enchanting table, just clickbait :I
Coolest survival base in minecraft ever
What if you don’t have your bow?
soy calba
MUY VOID👀👀 EL VIDEO

You liturgy don't have a ferns crafting tabe
為什麼下不去
Por medio segundo, en el 11:03 podés ver que está en creativo
Wait wait wait, you took hours and hours to find the wandering traveler ? Every single time in my worlds, it take me 1H only, and that's for the longest time without it. The smallest for me, is 10 minutes after finding a village and 5 minutes after placing à bed   I must say, you're "Lucky" in a way  Édit : You're "Lucky" because none of them were spawning without stopping !! Yes, i hate that
0:15 shelkers 😂

bases in 2b2t

Can't you just place sand?

4:50 you could just break a boat and let a shulker hit you or couple of
minecraft needs hostile void native mobs
Hey Carvs, I know this is an old video but I'm only seeing it now and I notice something. Why are you playing Minecraft on hardmode and attempting to do this stunts? (No disrespect here asking kindly as I'm really just curious) Because if you die on hardmode we all know we lose our world so why take the risk?
Bro rlly called a Donkey a Llama and said a Llama had 3 slots instead of 6
No you have a 11
Go to end of the vids and see ban me
Bro why you build a village house for
bro got a wandering trader just for him to despawn a few mins later...
just use a bucket of water to go up and down
U are sukkkk!!!!
Hey!!😉😉😁😄
No crafting table no base
2:19 bro's platform finna look like a new ed sheeran album cover
9:20 bro match the song       oh wait minecart-chest
Bro
Can't you put some sand over your boats ?
why does the health bar changes in 0:40 to 0:53
[]:
I remember the first world I ever opened up I spawned right in the mooshroom biome and I never knew it was that rare until now
I know this comment to be late but I'm from the beginning
Bra man to less videos man😅😊 pls upload more man😂
Only OGs can like this
More like a base made out entirely of entities
Fr
This guy deserves an award!
Look at the chat at 11:45 is he faking his vids?
Ok
8:43 so a donkey is a llama now?
I thought of a way it might not work but build piston thingy and make a base on top of it and somehow make it so the base is connected to the piston and make it on there if you want it easier to make a farm for wood 🪵 put a dirt block in there somehow and get lots of umm those plant growing thingys
do kendra sunderland sara jay taylor wane luna star
This base can build on 2B2T???
11:03 he clearly used creative in there. (put in in slow motion where he corrected him "*farmer*") you guys are just defending bc you dont accept it. and i know you are trying to run away from it carvs!! if you delete this comment it will prove it.
bro he can use sand
I've always been thinking this is a possible 2b2t strat already
where does bro get the shulkers from???
8:40 He said llama not donkey :D
MOJANG IS GONNA CALL YOUU☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
The only minecraft youtuber who cares about chickens.
Anyone in 2024?
JESSE WE NEED TO BUILD (v2)
Atleast tell us u would use abit of help with creative at 11:03
4:50
Dude you set the bar to the fucking ceiling😂 you put more than needed in a base. A mob farm, villagers, and shit😂 I don’t even do that to my regular bases
I would say "get a life" but you gotta admit, this is pretty dang cool
Shinji house (yokoso sakasama no sekai)
16:04
ok but, to make the way back from there, just use the boats.
you can drop sand on top of the shulkers so they will stop hurting you
12:07 you literaly bring animals down there 🥶
1:57 stupid stupid 🤣🤣🤣
did u got crazy that night?
See  8 :15 his heart his heart become normal  See 11 :03 he is in creative
yeah but... Why
Cards to two mil 🎉
11:26 you can see the mod tab
ooh diamonds: proceeds to blow it up. Aww dang it, it blew up
Funfact you can actually make a world in version 1.17 or older and then convert the world into 1.18 or later versions and you can build a proper base just on the old chunks
Play in a flat A world with no village and no stronghold and beat the and the dragon
Mmm m m mmmmm mm mm m mmmmm mmmm m mm m mmm
Shulkers❌ Shelkers/shelters✅
Bro. The video was good, but because of your click bait I’m extremely disappointed.

2:20 bro literaly made =x=                                          x=x
Clickbait. Wasted my time with this idiot
“…only 3 inventory slots” Well…multiplied by 2, I guess…
Who’s watching in 2024
Bro is literally saying in every video,, oh my gyatt’’💀
Wandering traders despawn no matter what
15:00 😮😂
I have replicated this setup in survival but the shulker sees me through the boats, gets in one of them when it opens to attack since it sees me, and breaks everything. Did testing in creative and same result every time, any ideas?
14:24 C o l l e c t i o n   T i m e

Remove wandering trader
So all I gotta do to stop wandering Traders from spawning is to want them to spawn, jesus
who LOVES carvs vids?  👇
Carvs: oh my God I'm so duuumb 😣 Me: bro you are the smartest Minecraft youtuber I've ever met
Bro @ht11 lives there 💀
Bro at 4:48 he dropped his elytra and fireworks
7:25 Nice Bandrud cosplay)
I must of taken you so long that you’re fingers died :D
Em cũng có Minecraft giống anh nữa ❤
fun fact wandering traders will be spawned for 20 minutes at a time so it's useless if you give wandering traders a name tag
I miss old carvs
u could do for the way out u can just use boats and stack them and use the boats to get up
The part when he threw the ender pearl and it fell into the void gave me a cool idea. What if there was a mod that made it so if you threw an ender pearl into the void, you would get teleported to a void dimension? I guess you could just make it the end or the nether, but it would be more interesting if it was some crazy new place.
Everything’s possible. I respect you for making who we think we are possible. You’re doing it … 0:00
"Shulkers can still see me" you still got armor on buddy
8:40 a lama?
plp who saw bed rock
Oh my gyaat
Couldn't you build a minecart elevator?
This got me nervous because of the way you could die on mistake
Bro said lama 𝟸 𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚜𝚒nstead of saying donkey 😂
don't forget your bow
500k club!
at 13:11 ish, when he opens the chat and there's a respawn point set message
When i saw him saying he cant get chests or shulkers down there i first thought of Minecarts with chests.
Carvs vs sb737 👇
0:24 "Makes a little plaform" *Shulker HITS the player* "OH! Oh no. Stop it. Stop. STO-"
Carving love from India Why you are not making wood farm

I love ur voice
Bro you are literally like a scientist of minecraft
Base in the void is actually insane
Mans using creative.
0:10 oh my gyat
Just Nether portal
You can just use piston😅
11:02
For a split-second at 11:03, you can clearly see he is in creative.
13:15 we can get mushroom cow by lightning a normal cow 😊
bro got 1 mil subs in 1 year 💀 that's amazing
Step one: download this mod
That's a lot of insane suffering to go through lol, true motivation
Hope  Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to justify us to God and to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
1.49 mil sub
0:06 “oh my gyatt”
:o
14:00 That base needs walls, and a roof, you can try to use the boats to make a column and spread it step by step to cover it
*crys*
9:04”a lmama has more slots” bro showed us a donkey
Where is bad?
To get out of the void why not use minecart's stacked on top of each other
How did bro get 1m5 subs with 20 vids
0:08 I thought he said gyat 😂😂😂😂
Other: Man this is too hard I'll hop on creative  Carv:
why not push things down with pistons ?
i swear you used creative
You are so crazy ... 😂😂😂😂
at 8:42  he called the donkey a llama
um, wenzo also built a void base so it is not the last one
Aaaaand now I have to binge watch the whole channel. (I've actually found you with the base build) Get my subscription, good sir.
The Witch King in Zwillingstürme im Herbst be like:
Я от русского переводчика
Creative why bro why
SOOOO no one talking about the creative on 11:03?
The reason why the shulkers levitate  is beacause the death layer of the void is under the void start(like the event horisen of a black hole) is acted like a block and shulkers stand on the sides of blocks
1 minute of silence for all the chickens he used😢
USE MINECRAFT  MOD
11:03 I had a feeling you playing on creative and you just exposed yourself. Unsubbed.
00:08 ohhh my gyatt 💀
lol we are in creative at 11:03
You cam get out without the elytra just let the shulkers hit you
8:30 - 8:45 your English
Why you blow the diamond
“Crys” 💀
Why you didn’t make ladder from minecarts
Void base nah entity base yeah
Cringe🗿

How you get infinite bad omen
You need a bed for Villagers to make bad omen to work
Ayoo: BRO MADE TOO Much Õ_o  4:09
Нахер смотреть у тебя в тг, если можно посмотреть оригинал в ютубе?
U soo smart!!🎉
Nice job, but terrible clickbait.
There's no way to stop wandering traders from despawning though lol. They ALWAYS despawn even with name tags, boats.
Like my comment if you were the first subscriber to Carvs
Video took forever just hop in creative
From killing stacked players with powdered snow, to building a house in the void.
Best video EVERRR!!! ❤🔥👏🏻
This won’t last long so never delete this world
This video might seems just 17minutes, but the actual time to make this .. ughh can't imagine the effort , GG
11:07 its not gonna work becouse you need more than 1 villager to set the village
He has handy dandy villagers  🤣😂
The void raid didn't work because for a raid to happen, you need a villager, a bed, and a work station. Because two of those things are blocks, it is impossible to start a void raid.
17:15 cats... oh, i mean doggies don't taking any falling damage
4:04 🤫🧏‍♂️
I wjbxt7’5😊😊😊😊
what
Just insane
crys
my last world was almost entirely shrooms biome, at the beginning i was happy with that cause i knew it was rare and full of resoursces but then when i realized i cannot find anithing else but shrooms everywhere it becomes a little annoing, don't know what the heck is happened with that seed xD
marry me
Pov: you're too op for Minecraft   Like I'm sorry I breathe your air 😭😭😭

I wish you wouldn't lie for clout
😅ñDear [Friend's Name],  I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. Recently, I immersed myself in the captivating chapter, "A Homage to Our Brave Soldiers," and the narratives about the National War Memorial have left an indelible mark on my emotions.  **I) National War Memorial:** The National War Memorial stands as a poignant testament to the valor and sacrifice of Indian fallen heroes. Nestled in the heart of the nation, it is a sacred space that meticulously honors and immortalizes those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The intricate design and solemnity of the memorial create an atmosphere of reflection, inviting all to remember and honor the brave souls who defended our freedom.  In its essence, the National War Memorial serves as a collective memory, ensuring that the stories of our heroes are not lost to time. It symbolizes a nation's gratitude, respect, and perpetual remembrance for the sacrifices that have shaped our history.  **II) Importance for a Nation:** The importance of the National War Memorial for our nation cannot be overstated. It goes beyond being a physical structure; it is a reservoir of our collective memory and a symbol of national unity. By acknowledging and preserving the sacrifices of our heroes, the memorial fosters a profound sense of patriotism and instills a shared responsibility among citizens to uphold the values for which these brave souls fought.  In times of reflection, the memorial serves as a silent educator, imparting the lessons of courage, sacrifice, and resilience to future generations. It stands as a testament to the cost of freedom and the unwavering spirit that defines our nation.  **III) Indian Fallen Heroes and Their Sacrifices:** The chapter vividly brought to life the stories of Indian fallen heroes, each narrative a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made on the battlefield. From the icy heights of the Himalayas to the vast deserts, these brave souls, hailing from diverse backgrounds, stood united in their commitment to defend our sovereignty.  Their sacrifices encompass not only the physical toll on the battlefield but also the emotional burden carried by their families. The chapter eloquently portrays the multifaceted nature of sacrifice, emphasizing the selflessness and dedication embedded in the ethos of our armed forces.  **IV) Why is it Important to Pay Homage:** Paying homage to our fallen heroes is a solemn duty that transcends generations. It is a gesture of gratitude, a tangible expression of our collective acknowledgment of the debt we owe to those who secured our freedom. By honoring their memory, we ensure that their sacrifices are never in vain, and their spirit lives on as a guiding light for our nation.  Homage is not just a ritual; it is a perpetual commitment to upholding the principles and values for which our heroes laid down their lives. It fosters a sense of continuity, linking the past, present, and future in a seamless thread of remembrance and appreciation.  **V) A Story of Fallen Hero - Captain Vikram Batra:** Among the narratives that resonated deeply was the story of Captain Vikram Batra, a hero of the Kargil War. His courage and unwavering determination in the face of adversity embody the very spirit that the National War Memorial stands to honor. Captain Batra's supreme sacrifice, known for his poignant words "Yeh Dil Maange More!" (This heart asks for more), serves as an eternal inspiration for all those who strive for excellence and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for a greater cause.  In the echoes of Captain Vikram Batra's story, we find not only a tale of bravery but a reminder that true heroes are those who selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.  In conclusion, the chapter has deepened my appreciation for the significance of the National War Memorial and the sacrifices of our fallen heroes. It has ignited a flame of gratitude in my heart, and I carry forward a renewed sense of pride in being part of a nation with such a rich tapestry of valor.  Wishing you strength and reflection,  [Your Name]

PLS DAY 2 OF ASKING YOU TO DO 100 DAYS IN THE SMALLEST BASE
11:03
We need walls for base
minecraft yters are wasting their lives. this shit isn't even fun we'd all have preferred you to have done this in creative, all this work is just painful to watch considering the life span wasted on it
Bro I found the mushroom island like ten times

I feel like I’m so bad at minecraft😊
I know you worked hard but your fricking clickbaited me you fricking wasted my whole fricking time!!! 😠  Dislike!!! 😠

I guess you could in theory do this without an elytra and hitting endgame and what not but it would take a loooong time
pretty sure mobs don’t move bc there’s no blocks for them to pathfind to
It doesn't even have a bed
500k
2:08 this is awesome :D

You don't think they will do something you do in order at that moment to do something with that kind or whatever and not make your honey or something you can get to. for them as long and you're a used one or not the person you're talking in about and
😮😮😮
I knew he was cheating. He was in creative in 11:03 and in survival in 0:48 lol
Caught in creative😂😂
hi
Get a goods nights rest carvs, make sure to sleep or else the trauma of a nether roof base is coming for you..
11:03 nice creative
No bed :(((
0:11 bro really thought he could hide that “ohhh my gyashhh”💀
i do like him but shulker can shoot me😢
I had a dream a few years back that I built a minecraft house upside down, and I got really disappointed when I couldn’t build anything underneath.
Honestly why keep watching after the first 30 seconds. That just kinda answers the video title.
BRAEAKING DIRT IN THE MUSIC? BY SON
I did some mining off camera
But you Name it
I've been here since 1.3 mil 😁
Build stairs using those chests…
They see you with invisible potion when you wear or hold something, including elytra
In the thumnnail ur inventory have netherite pickaxe and the rectangle shows ur holding rockets and ur hand show enchanted diamond pickaxe wth.
What !
Theres like a very small frame at 11:03 where hes in creative
How many bases do you have? 😂
How do people even come up with this stuff
☪️? ✝️?🔯
8:27 or you can use boat chests
The man just walked past a trader 15:19
How dare you blow up a diamond?😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am calling police u r doing illegal stuff 😮
Please make a redstone video about how you do your machines plsss
Yes place water

8:42 use a boat chest
I can't believe he takes so long and does it for us ❤
Gokil L
whats the name of the background music you use?
Damn, those cows really don't "moove"
You should have the ender pearl stasis chamber on a timer, like 5 minutes, so that if you run out if arrows you’ll still get back
what if that ender pearl makes it there
1:31 becouse you’re touching them
e
nice work
nice work
Thee.  Editing.  Though.  🏆🏆🏆  Incredible content  Videos of Excellence are abundant on this channel     Thank you Good Sir 🎩
11:03 🧐🧐🧐
Clickbait.
How many times have you died in this world?
u called the donkey a llama lmao  great video
bro u disrespected diamond so hard
13:19 you just missed the ancient debris lol
Why you don’t just build directly on the shulkers to stop them seeing you and going strait to boats and didn’t give an explanation on why you went strait to boats instead of blocks is beyond me
gdzie jest lozko? mialo byc lozko
Why is this funny 9:36
Give a fox a shulker box for storage 9:27 9:28
GO GET THOOSE DİEAMONDS QUİCK THE BOATS DESPAWN AFTER 3 HOURS💀
Erm actchually they aren't called mooshroom cows they are just called mooshrooms
"Haha stupehd stupehd stupehd" 😂
click bait but cool vi
Thanks for the click bait 👎
Major clickbait dawg, once again Carvs never fails to dissapoint >:(
Willingly blowing up diamonds is a huge flex 😂
base looks lame, cool concept though
8:42 saying llama instead of donkey 😞😞
It would be cool if minecarts and boats could be stacked in a way to look like a house.
what about the bed
The fact that you used creative  in 11:03 is so lame...
POR FAVOR VINICCIUS 13 NAO VEJA ESSE VIDEO!
That musical editing at 9:20. Perfecto
The villagers can't restock, that's gonna be an issue
Bro is boring in his life so he do this
Bro crafted sticky pistons but forgot to craft a water buket
kill one more donkey or llama and i will unsubscribe
im in the 500k club lets go
She knows everything just like acookie god
Забавно, я не зная английского понимаю его
No your smart
He speeds everything up and makes it so easy but then says ITS NOT😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Can make more videos
I love your videos
If your cheating, at least do it professionally
Lamba seotuna e cozi crande ce lo trovo in tutti i miei mondi
a llama can have up to 15 slots of chest space depending on its strength value btw
@baww build
Is he cheating ?
11:04 Creative
Correction: 8:40 „Instead of a Donkey“ (you said: „Instead of a Lama“)
Chestboat😂
2:33  That sentence shouldn't even exist
Is there anything you can't get automatically?
11:03 🤨
11:03
last video you say you're not good at redstone
bro literally he is in creative 11:04
11:02 He's in creatice
Loved the part where he was in creative byt forgot to edit it out at 11:02. What a total faker
the 10k dislikes is everyone who saw him use creative at 11:03
11:02 why do you have no health and no hunger in this frame.
Impressive, but disliked for the clickbait.
Roblox is better but still subbed
You can just play on a version that allows you to build under the void
no offense but bros quote is : OH MY GYAAD!!
He's going to be so sad when he realises that there is no way to keep a Wandering Trader spawned fir more than like 15 minutes. Not even a name tag. You can actually see that it despawned at the end of the video
Why you didn’t just simply bridge downwards like “mudflaps”
let’s see what’s the next video
Let’s see what’s the next video
Nobody going to notice he got infinite bad omen? Its supposed to give you 100 minutes meaning it was through commands
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
instead of using shulkers what if u used shulker boxes
hi
were is the bed
this guy is legendary
Bro can't count. ''a lAMa hAs 3 SLotS''
I feel bad for that one pig that got nailed by an arrow when he tried shooting at the target
you set your respawn point using commands during the wandering trader timelapse
pretty sure if u put a carpet on the shulkers they cant see u or i might be wrong idk
I hope u aren't going crazy
12:20
What kind of clickbait garbage video is this bro. It’s not even a base it’s just a bunch of floating boats
13:28 чел чел чел
"Land down slowly,land down slowly ah. Atleast we go one" 😂
The FBI agent me FBI
Theres more comments than likes.
u cant di a raid unless your villiage has 13 villagers and cats randomly spawn
bro cheated lmao hes in creative at 11:03 see closely... reduce the speed of the video and then see
Bro dont just enderpearl just stack Minecarts
USE SAND
12:27 bro only just found out💀
Oh my gyashhh
And if you use a piston to push down a block as far as possible ?
L
I spawned on a mushroom island once
this man can count 8:31
the fact that you have 11 videos and 1 million subs 🤨🤨
This might be the most dangerous video he made because falling in the void will kill you even with totem of undying
5:40 RIP Mr Enderpearl🪦🕊😔
If Napoleon had his dedication, we're doom
احبك استمر يا اسطوره
Its amazing
This base looks so fire. The fact it was a functioning base with 0 blocks involved is sick
He said lama instead of donkey
I liked the video then immediately unliked when he said mushroom cow.
dang too late im not in 500k club
Наконец-то хоть кто-то решил отважиться построить базу в Ижевске
15:14 you can clearly see the llamas from the wandering trader
❤❤
cant you push blocks down there with pistons ?
I lose more of my soul every time he says shulker like “shelker”
10:56 14:38
Fun fact: If you replay the video at 15:54, Your subscribe button will do something strange .3.
"shelker"
Bro whys my man in Creative at 11:03 💀

The thumb makes it look like a tiny house
Hi

8:40 lmao thats not a lama
wandering trader on 15:14
1:39 "After experimenting for hours"... Bro just put a pumpkin on your head, they'll think ur a mob
why cant you just firework up there like you do insted of using the ender pearal machiene
Mobs don’t move because the path finding is broken  They path find to blocks, and blocks cannot exist in the void
bruh this and the fastest way to travle are the best vidios EAVER
more vills to make a raid                                                                                                                                     b
Please laugh out loud every single day you make great videos And you are the GOAT!😃🤗
15:14 wandaring trader bro he missed it
If you had merch I would buy it :D
I have 42 shorts and 11 vids  But I have 49 subs :(
How did you get 1 mil with 14 vids and no shorts?!?!?!?!  BbBrRrRUuuUuUuuUHhHHHHhHh
The video was so interesting, i forgot to speed up the video
bro no way that real bro your a freaking hacker if it don't work
Can't we drop sand or gravel on the shulkers?
Nice clickbait
Or WATER
The logic in minecraft from the falling cows is that the most time the entity is in the air, the most damage it will get
I accually found giant mushrooms that was NOT on the mushroom island is that even possible
you have unlocked the power of the boatem hole!
This man is a PSYCHOPATH
I’m so confused how you can know so much about Minecraft and not understand that NPCs and chorus fruit don’t work unless there’s solid blocks, but GO OFF 🔥
The wandering trader was pointless you can't stop them from despawning. The mobs don't move because there are no blocks for them to move to. Mobs will walk off of boats. Normally dropping a boat onto a shulker will cause it to teleport, but they had no nearby blocks to teleport to. You can do this in the sky too doesn't have to be in the void. It is not "mooshroom cow" it is just "mooshroom" Furnace minecart is not a furnace it is an engine, serves no purpose.(I suspect you figured that out but it was still there in the end so I thought I'd mention it for other viewers)
I wanted to see a ghast there as you said ¬_¬
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊
The ultimate base for pvp/ faction servers
14:58 this made me cry
8:00 there is no pathing maps for them to use so the stay still
So much effort, for a base you will NEVER use...  F...
ive been subscribed since 1260 😔😔😔
VOID???
bro my fucking adhd could NEVVVERRRRR
Why didnt u just put water and build on the roof bro
"stupid stupid stupid" im dying bro how are you sane and funny after all that work 😭
All this science Minecraft talk is hurting my brain 😵‍💫
Alternatively. Throw water down...
What episode this is? cause how you got dat already 😐
Been a while since i played, can you piston push into the void?
Bro’s brain is out of this world 🤯🤯
Shitty clickbait peel a se become better than this
what would you do if you wernt rec? ANYWAYS back to my comment   i watched this already and i forgot so im watching again u EARNED a new SUB!    Edit : ooos im already subed- THE I MAKE BELL BLACK lol

i swear people would do anything for some views😭🧑🏻‍🦯
Meshing in minecraft
I don't even play Minecraft but I watched the  whole video and just have appreciate the effort
clickbait
WATER: "Am i a joke to you?"
HELL NOOOOOO THIS VIDEO IS ANXIETY
but why you didn't used a shulker to shoot you up to exit your base ? you put it somewhere he can only detect you under your mob farm so he won't bother you in the rest of your base and you can still exit your base without ender pearl
I assume its also impossible to use a flying machine to put blocks down there? Would be cool to try to make a small structure by sending blocks down one by one essentially
O my good
Ok
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idlHzXQoFo4
Congratulations for 1 million subs! Love your videos
why not drop sand
I wish i had this kind of creativity in Minecraft lmao xD
Carvs: what did u expect me to do?  Me:go to creative

You are mr Beast in Minecraft bro 😂👍👍
I didnt even know there was a void, until yhis man showed up with this video. Fucking legend
Good luck trading with those villagers lmao
This house is the most budget looking thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂

Actual garbage teir clickbait content
i wish to not be dumb
No bed :(
Me sweating in my dirt block main base
You are masichist
Did he not sleep at the whole night 😳  if he not sleeps he's eyes and brain will hurt
11:03 creative
this dude seems too dumb to not die 1000 times in void in the proceeds download and reload the world
Not even The pillager want to Be welcome in the void
I have 2 bases and you're fire😘B-) ⛪🏡🏠🏘
11:24 Bro why do is there a area full of diamond blocks in the left
where is your wandering merchant? :C cant see him 17:34
The void is calling to me and I must respond
Should've built a boat elevator, would be cool
Are u saying me stupid 😅? 8:06
8:36 No way he just called a donkey a Llama
Face rveal
you can breed llamas to have more inventory slots
8:39
Genius guy
“Before I hit 500k” me watching him with 1.02m
The trader dissappeared.
Very young chanel
This base should be put up as best Minecraft base
This guy is creative
A base without an auto-smelter?
😺 meow 🐈
Bruh
Did you try lava and water?
А теперь вопрос: Haxyя?
Put your bow in your house
Aight we all know u cheated but its cool
I accidentally found a mushroom island when I was playing(I’m a noob)
I’ve been subscribed since your first video
To escape the void just let a shulker shoot you and give you levitation.
‏‪7:17‬‏  did he really clutched ☠️🗿
Wait thats illegal
plot, if ender pearl 5:43 teleported you to void📉📉📉
4:09 sorting algorithm sound
gotta be the best survival minecraft youtuber
16:39 i saw that hole in the base
couldn't he just have used water to float in the void and build a platform?
Bro cooked the shulker 😂1:56
I can tell he was tired and sleepy the entire time he made that video
Yes, you are that dum
ĺeadíng a heárd of cowṣ ìnto ţhe vòíd.
U deserve the  million views for the hard work man
Wandering traders respawn even if you name them so there’s no way u can keep him
12:49 for perspective on this percentage, the map of the biomes around the mosh room island would be a 42x42 square. Each block represents a biome and in the map there is one single block that’s a mooshroom biome.   42x42 = 1764 blocks  1/1764 = 0.00057 0.00057 = 0.057%, as the stat said.
Now do this in 2b2t
This guy’s “Aha!” Is the best 😆
TNT or a break so like good night daughter does the time but right now I want telling us who have fallen short on Powerball is one minute till is it disappear from one form zero minutes OK OK OK OK?

What do you like your top comments? I’m on my dad. Kind of how my dad account but I’m on my iPad. OK, pesola saying well. Believe me because I won’t be on team a white teams I wanna order anything for you are we on the planet? I am Anna I am a big fan of you. I wanna love every single video on videos.
Why
For the invis problem: normally shulkers p - or any mob - shouldn’t be able to see you when you are invisible. However there is a limit to that. If you get too close any mob will see you. I believe the minimum distance is 2 or 3 blocks
Are you crazy 😠 you bloo up daimons 😢
Why is he givving Skeppy vibes.. Perhaps.. the same person?!
👌👌👌😏
Hhhhhhiiiiii
what is the name of that background music
It's kinda crazy that you spent like 5 hours trying to find a wandering trader, when they can't be trapped and despawn after 40 minutes
This is why he barely uploads
14:57 imagine just being soo rich you don't gaf about diamonds ☠️☠️
Wow
So funny
2:14
I have 300 v bukx
...still it doesn't work in multi since entities gets cleaned periodically :|
That bow ender this is GENIUS
the entire base was just entities so if you do /kill @e you would destroy the entire base
14:55 bro you should have donated those diamonds to the poor
1M🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩
why r u not dyeing
u are crazy
He is literally banking on the shulkers NOT despawning all the while naming the trader to avoid that very thing.
The risk this man made respect❤
The rare is tat you crate new world and joind and you spam in smahmoorm iland it’s the rares in all time i saw just in one youtober tat spawn on mashroom iland
good vid, i but i couldn't stand how you say shulkers, s h a u k e r s
You're holding totems so they can see you
996K worth it
Wow
Yo get back up you could have just let one of the shulkers shoot you and then leverage up
How weird dose it sound when he says shulkers
"gotta escape the void, theres no other choice, yeah"
The beginning and idea was fully stolen. Mysticat made this some time ago.
bed you forgot the bed but its ok Igues
HE IS CLEARLY USING /Gamemode creative WICH MEANS HE IS PROBABLY USING CREATIVE ASWELL. WATCH 8:16 FOR EXAMPLE. BUT HE USES IT ALL THE TIME
oHh myYy gYaTt
/kill @e
The dark surrounds you. Ah, peace.

WHY IS IT THAT YOUTUBERS THAT ONLY HAVE LESS THAN TEN VIDEOS GET SO MUCH LOVE BUT MY XHANNEL HAS BEEN ON FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND OVER 84 VIDEOS AND I HAVE LASS THAN 40
Hello
Impressive base, could use a bed though. But there's a mob farm too, no one is stupid to build a mob farm in the void, a insanely creative idea! Love it, Subscribing right now!

Carvs

No way you’re not related to cantina.
You forgot a bed

that was grian and mumbo's  season 7 base
Bro just can make a house out of anything and everywhere 💀💀💀
In a snapshot (I forgot which) you can build in the void
bro u could've just made another teleportation device on the other platform or just pearl or just use an elytra. but overal good video
Bro he never used a ghast
Wel i fince det you ar coole
this vid is so bad sorry
in a 1.18 glitch you could build in the void
the wierd stuff is a ghast an im only 9 mins in
“Pretty simple and easy mob farm” *me who can’t build a fraction of that*
That’s crazy I get a wondering villager every 30 min 😆.  *on a fresh world where I was just building on a mountain*
8:37 *same thing as a llama you can put a chest on it. Instead of only having 3 slots a “llama” has way more* 😂 forgot he was on a donkey
3:37 *crys* - cries**
This is exactly what I imagined trying to build any sort of colony outside Earth: dark, everything wants to kill you, requires a mind-numbing amount of resources, and yet out of the stubbornness of man bears  something beautiful yet dreadful
i sub at 100k
I absolutely love your videos, keep going!
Bro void base
Looks at 6 inventory slots  Yep that's 3
900k subs in 13 videos congrats 🎉
Hey dude my brother called you stupid

Love from India ❤
What if you forget arrows and elytra
clickbait
a world of mine once had 6 or 7 mushroom biomes right next to one another
Bro, you do really good videos, thanks from Ukraine
4:44 nah bruv did bro just drop that elytra???
how to make them not attack /gamemode creative
They should add a dimension which uses the portal in the ancient city, which is like 100 millennia into the future of the nether. The netherrack is pale grey and cold, the nether fortresses are crumbling, all biomes are dead and wiped away, but a new species has conquered the nether using a new rare ore found extremely deep underground which is able to produce heat and be crafted into extremely powerful weapons that doesn’t require fire aspect to burn stuff and can last a very very long time but is too hot for enchantments and will burn them off  lol idk just a really cool idea
Pizza
Your mom eats too many Butterfingers and smell like Butterfingers but but but but but but but but but cheeks with marinara sauce on them and inhale laugh laugh laugh laugh REEEEEEEEE
Ur mom
@minecraft
easy way back up : stacked boats/minecarts
you trict me
Then the package
A long time to think we could build under the void
Ya Shiller is idiot
DAM I DONT EVEN HAVE A BASE. JUST A HOUSE IN A CAVE OR A TREE
"Because you cant place Shelkers"
bro sent HIMSELF to the shadow realm
He said "shelker" when talking about storage
Early access
14:59 that was brutal 😂😂
The reason the mobs cant move in the void is because (im guessing) its out of the games NAV bounds, which is what allows events to happen in a certain area (the entire map) including mobs moving.
Broo blod up dimonds
You need at least a workstation to start a raid.
literal clickbait image
Cvh
Bro really thought that we did not see that dick
When you don’t want a wandering trader Wandering trader : * spawns * When you want a wandering trader Wandering trader : * dosen’t spawn *
how about a bed
Bro doesn’t know that each lama has a different storage amount lol
Shoot the target with my bow Shoot the target with my bow SHOOT THE TARGET WITH M-
the raid did not spawn beacuse villagers need acces to the working stations to count as a village and start a raid
Dude this is gorgeous it should be viral

1:54 "for some reason it makes the shulker not be able to see". Maybe because the BOAT IS ON ITS DAMN HEAD
You wasted your time 👎
at 15 16 he walks by a wandering trader
i just realised those villagers will never be able to refill their stock of supplies
That is the best base I have ever seen 😍😍😍😍😁😁😁😁🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
in 11:02 of the video, you can see how he is in creative, you are a dirty cheater carves...
10:53 they need some block space, bed and working place, so it wont work

Now that its 1.20 use the shards to make designs on armor

Basically, reverse Skyblock

The holes in between the boats gives me fear.
Egg

Nice base for 2b2t
Watching this process alone makes me nauseous. This is the pinnacle of anxiety, period.

8:20  S H E L K E R   B O X
Can you do a face reveal
When you said wandering trader, I almost didn't know what you're saying. Because those are just free leads to me.
Couldn’t you have just used a piston and sand to push the REAL blocks down as far as possible?
8:04 “Because they can’t moooo-ve”
What is ur face
Does any of this work on Java?
The fact that u have 12 videos is so cool u have so many subscribers and i have over 20 videos and i don't even have 10 subscribers so if u want to be my 7th  subscriber u r more then welcome  ❤️

Couldn't you just connect a block to a shulker?
Bro actually threw one of his elytra's in the void.
The thmbnail bruh, u baited us
the shulker saw you because you were holding totems
I hAve in idea what about carvus makes a sky base
Just A Tip: There is a Ender Pearl Launcher that u can make, it makes the average ender pearl go around 5 times faster i think... Theres many tutorials in YouTube... Just saying...
I think you are a noob
boat stairs simple
The raid no work cause there is no bed
Minecraft hacked mojang😂😂
your vid is cool
is not a base without a bed :/ lol just kidding, amazing video
Can you not just build a pillar downward and build off of that? Or does placing get completely turned off before a certain level?

Him: Just wait until the end to see the finished base  Me who is watching a pre recorded video and can just skip to the end:

He is soo cool and crazy and funny 😂😂

I love you Việt Nam
Damn his insulting the poor shulkers Lol
good video
I think it can see you the boat just makes it so it can’t open. EDIT: that coral reef looks like the ones over here in Australia.
The void is literally one of the scariest places in any videogame. 😂 I did built a giant spaceship in it once but it felt so uneasy.
4:58 very rare you say eh how funny every time I load up a world to start a new survival or creative I always spawn there hm I guess I'm built different😎😎
I’m in the 600k club

A lama has more space got me XD
10,54 THE VILIGER NEEDS A BED
Hi
Dont worry, i am subcrided
The reason mobs cant move is because their pathfinding dorsbt see any blocks so imagine putting them on 1 block in the middle of the air the wouldnt walk off and the reason they dont kive at all is because you putting them on an entity (boat) which isnt in there pathfinding so they dont know where to move.
You my frind are the man fo my childhood ft. I am a kid 13:44
Bro forgot the bed
Bros ending lowkey gave me old smosh vibes💀💀
fun fact, mobs don't move on the void base because technically there are no blocks for them to path to
What the hell  you just started u be pro brooo
Bro forgot water
O no
8:15 WHY YOU IN SURV???
4:45 efficize on that
HAHA STUPID STUPID STUPID lol

bro just wasted an elytra lol
11 naman
SOMEBODY TELL ME WHY THAT A MOOSHROOMCOW IS A COW PAWN SAY IT MOO-SHROOMCOW😂😂
Here’s a reason it didn’t work The reason is because we need a bell and a bed but since it’s the void we can’t place blocks. 10:34
cool
This was the best hideout for me in my smp thx every single player hunts me down because i am the top thief in the smp lulz but for real in this smp no mods exist were all free not under control

HOW
Bro really called shulkers shelkers at 8:19
Please, can you put a translation into Arabic, we will enjoy more 😊😊❤
This is cool, but don't boats despawn?
How about building a base in farlands?
you need the shulkers to shoot you so when you run out of fire works shulkers will be like No problom
10:56 I bet we all were screaming at our screens saying 5 VILLAGERS NOT 1
1:58   "haha loser stupid stupid stupi-" proceeds to talk normally 2:14 "haha stupid stupid stupid 💀
Your dedication to this video definitely deserves a sub like and comment!💯🔥
Op
https://youtu.be/Cd-s88lUzzc
What would happen if you pushed the chests?
10:53 you need a bed, bell and a door to start a raid. Using this trick, u can even start a rad in the nether EDIT: in the FRICKIN END TOO!!
7:32 i alredy knew and thought about that
8:30 ah yes 3
5:43 how did he survive the teleportation void death
Legends say that the ender peerless was still falling through the void
12:47 speaking of mushroom boimes when i had and xbox 360 at 10 yrs old i had a world i spawned in a mushroom boime and never knew it was rare

The shulkers saw you with invis because you had stuff in your hand. That's how it works, having things in your hands is the same as still wearing armor
500k!!!!!!!!!!!
give me the prize or i will unsubscribe i just started watching you so please give me the prize
Just use a water bucket...
The raid didn't work because there was no bell and no job site block there
Remember me when your famus

Imagine Minecraft crashes, and then when he logs back on he’s dead in the void

You're a god
Pistons?
Bro could make the base close to stronghold
Shelker
Man you threw an elytra in the void?!? Why, just for 10 seconds of video wth
what if you had no arrows because you missed so much and you were in the void
10:50 for a raid to start it needs a bed and a villager at least
Can't you drop sand on the shulkers to get a better floor?

Bro i hardly get one ore of iron and he is just blowing up diamonds  Bruhhh ;-;
The reason why the raid never started is because the villager wasn’t linked to a bed. Amazing video tho, really interesting how expansive you can be.
Rare? I Leaterly found a mushroom island connected to an ice island connected to a dark oak forest with that gray villager thing the big one and what i did? Yeah i i lost the world😅  Oh and next to it was a island with a terracotta thing idk what its called
Where was the house in the thumbnail clickbaiter

Wait... dont boats despawn?
this looks so stupid lol this is to cursed
Not hi
Members of 500k subs😎 👇
Wait, if you're so good at redstone, why would you even build a base manually, with all those shulkers and stuff? Just build a platform and lower it into the hole using automated moving system.
After this video ,mojang don't talk to fans anymore😄 cool video
Just thinking of putting in the hours to do this makes my eyes hurt lol
this is literally the only vid of yours i've watched (so far) and i just couldn't help but sub. your dedication is insane bro i'd literally pay you for this if i could lol. love the vid man. keep it up:) <33

OH NO THE POOR DONKEY 😭
super rad video, just wondering but do you mainly voiceover or is it a combination of live commentary as well.
i in 500k club now YIPPEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Or... hear me out... to get back to the surface, CRAZY idea that can help for ender pearls or something else... How about making an open Shulker in the distance that can help you float up a bit... ORRRR add a timed lining of shulkers that will hit you while floating up... but i suppose it will be hard to figure out a whole line upwards.
I love how he says he has to think outside the box to build this base when he is literally outside the box

Why would you edit a thumbnail to look like a screenshot  for this and not use an actual screenshot of your game? Anyone else notice the thumbnail shows him holding a diamond pick but the hotbar has fireworks selected an no diamond pick in it. Seems counterintuitive

8:30  "the only problem is, it only has 3 inventory spots" *shows 6* "next up is a donkey, instead of having 3 spots (6) a *llama* has alot more" how many times will you mess up
mushroom islands aren't that rare. in my last 3 worlds, 2 of them had mushroom islands near the spawn (near is less than 3 km)

Gotta love the among us task complete sound every time you complete a task
so it's just some boats. clickbait thumbnail much?
U have time7 vids
Next time, drop ceiling mounted shulkers. They face upside down so you get a walkable bottom and they can't shoot you.

thats so amazing but it also gave me anxiety for some reason
The raid didn’t even have a chance to spawn since 1 nose cunt doesn’t count as a base. You need more nose cunts, beds, and station blocks.

This man's crazy why the fuck he needs a base in void what's the reason for this he can't even log out
I'm watching from India
re:  how to get back up:  Bro, you just had to stack increasing heights of minecart chests to build a stairway back up.  Which... may have required breaking yet more area but I mean you do that later in the video anyway.
Ngl i was here since 100k and bro istg this guy legit did the impossible and was suffering irl :_: but congratulations on successing you very likely have gotten a new world record!??!?!?

Super good video but also bro says LiBARian. Still tho W vid

The dedication he pus in his videos!
Pls ip of awaken smp

15:13 i saw two trader lamas
Bed?
yayyy b4 500k
500k club!
I got a wondering trader
An easier way to get back up: You could just stack boats on top of each other and then spam right click while looking up, then youll be able to get up quicker!
Not big on minecraft but i did hear you could befriend shulkers by holding that fruit you get from the ender world (the one that teleports you idk its name and im too lazy to check) anyway i heard it makes shulkers not attack you as long as it's in your hand
his girlfriend: *leaves* this guy: My girlfriend left so i’m gonna make an automatic girlfriend maker
The reason why the shulkers saw through your invis pot is because mobs can see you in 2 conditions: if you're wearing more than 1 piece of armour or if you bump into them. So walking on top was sadly not an option
mans just casually building farms to fix any problem, and braking the laws of Minecraft physics
Great video! i subscribed and i'm now part of the first 500k club!
Bro, you can just use moss block, I think
Bucket of lava, after bucket of water - Noooo So more shulcker's and boat - Yeeeeessss
bro may I ask how many storage did you got for this video honestly I'm kinda curious
Where's bed tho?
The video is sooo cool. But I am thinking since we can stack boats, can we make a stair with them to get back to the surface?
The clickbait, so funny lying with the thumbnail.
so dont be dumb
create an entire biome now.
when new vids :(
Wouldnt it have been easier to drop concrete Powder onto water? Aaves the whole boat hassle
what a brilliant way to waste your life
Revoked Donkey privileges.
Raids need at least 1 villager and at least 1 bed to start
This reminds me of that scene from the matrix. “Rules cannot be broken, but they can be bent”
Clockbait, tf u put a real house on the thumbnail just to build this ugly base
How could you use Minecart but not think of boats. Boat is life I make sure I have enough boats to crash the game per base
a
How in the heck is a wandering trader so hard to find most times im really far away from a village and they spawn like 5-10 minutes after I start playing

what's the song that starts at 2:01 ? and the one at 00:55? so dope !
The bad omen didnt work because if something has to count as a village it needs atleast one villager and a workbench for then

This guy has the Area 51 of Minecraft
No one dares to tell him that villagers can't refill their stock this way, so the trades are limited unless the villagers are changed every now and then

I really liked the video, but the dumb clickbait is just anoying, its not just putting BIG WORDS and trying to get attention, is literally putting images and things that are not in the video, just lame...

For those of you who loved this concept and want to see it done *as much justice as possible* go check out Can You Beat Minecraft From the Void by Mud Flaps. He starts from the void with only a starter chest and doesn't leave until he has Full Diamond Armor. Don't know how he could do that from the void? Go check out the video to find out.
now im part of the 500k subs please remebmer
why couldnt you just place one shulker and then build out of stone or something
This must be one of those dudes on his 7th ever channel. The content, thumbnail, editing and just overall creativity is just too professional. 8 videos? I doubt he has only made 8 videos.  Good stuff!

Bro took hidden base to another level
Subscribed
base made entirely out of entities
It is a base but is it a home?
Doesn't the fact that they don't have workstations mean that the villagers will never restock?
Cap it took u only 18 minutes
You have 144k subs! And I subbed!
I loved when he say "Haha stupid stupid stupid" lol it's funny to me
you are a legend bro
This video made me giggle
Can’t wait to show this world to my friends:
9:22 the digging goes along with the beat of the music! XD
It is so cool when people figure out the impossible like this. They should make the void accessible just to reward the community. Edit: yea I regret making this comment after learning the truth.
What seems strange to me is the base floor, I think as if you could fall there
At the donky part i know its annoying but just mute your Minecraft animal sound its simple!
Couldve used a minecart elevator or a boat elevator
Only in Ohio💀☠️

Am shocked how you have the patience to do all this. The time consuming parts look painful
15:00 no matter how cool the base is this right here is a crime that is unforgiveable you should be ashamed of doing this
Llamas actually have random inventory either 6, 9, or 12 slots, but donkeys always have 15.

Where is a bed?
Bro scared the shit pita me when he dropped the elytra and rockets 😂
Literally subscribed before the ad even started I could just tell it was gunna be good
A raid din’t spawn because there wasn’t a bed
You could technically make a mine cart stair case all the way up
Just a subtle engineering genius over there, "that's gonna take time, SO I JUST BUILT A CONVOLUTED MACHINE TO DO IT FASTER" he's like a cartoon genius like Dexter, Double d, Jimmy neutron, just doing the impossible and somehow being able to explain doing it nonchalantly
10 seconds in: LIKE
How do you break into the void anyway?
Amazing best video ever
10:46 you have to do more than have one villager it needs a bunch of villagers and I do believe a bell and the place need to be considered a village to spawn the raid
most impressive part of this whole thing is the fact that in the thumbnail, his slot has fireworks but he's holding a pickaxe.
it kinda annoys me how dumb he is with most of this shit
3:44 JAJAJAJAJ me at 3:33 am😂
it´s missing the bed
I love your content I suck at Minecraft 😅
What is world record for diamonds now?
I was kinda expecting there to actually be a house, I was unfortunately disappointed :/

6:55 no cows were harmed during the making of this video.
syouki no Saturday night
Ayooo im in the 500k club!
Ey
It's not a base. It's a lame-ass boat glitch
I dont watch or play minecraft no more but this was fun to see
you could of just used ONE sand block and skip all of this..
The reason they saw you in invis is because you were holding the totems
15:12 wandering trader
The raid didn’t spawn because of the requirements for a village werent met
Bro I liked this video until I clicked it and heard you talking. Bro I'm just being real, I stopped watching when I unmuted.

1:21 iirc, invis only reduces the distance a mob can see you from, if you get too close it can still detect you :0
Respect on the effort o7
Did not know this was possible, great video, man!
you did 2 kinda dumb things   1 - villagers wont restock without a job block, but you cant bring one down, so once you buy sth from them, they'll never restock  2 - wandering traders despawn anyways after 1 ingame day (unpreventable)
500ktem
He should of used the 1.18 glitch

How this guy only have a few videos and 400k subs already what
Try in the End
....I don't think those villagers can restock
Man i love your videos you should make them more often
I was here since the beginning!!!
I would be too lazy to do this in creative 💀
500 k gang
I think i know why it didnt start a raid I heard that 3 villagers are considered a village, but you only had one So it didnt start a raid Thats my guess, idk if the 3 villagers thing is true tho
You only have like 6 videos and the music and editing is amazing and the video content is awesome and I barely know minecraft anymore
new to the channel and i actually really like this
The tumb nail hass aweard on the pickaxe
I was here before 500k😊
500k club!!!!!!!!!
I think that you will be a successful YouTuber
Wear no armor, carry nothing in your hand, and no shield or anything in that spot, Invisible works perfectly.   Shulkers can sense you, but no idea where to shoot.   Can also place blocks and not be accosted
You can use scaffolding. just remove the boats and let it land on a shulker instead of the boats🤦
texture pack and minecraft version pls
✝️Repent from your sins🙏, turn to God before it’s to late⏰, for tomorrow is not promised ❤️
pretty sure you can use pistons to move blocks down lmao
This dude is actually growing pretty fast. He deserves it though because this is great quality and a lot of effort was put into the editing and the content. I'm impressed
Gotta love how on the thumbnail he is holding a pickaxe, but has rockets equipped. might wanna double check you photoshop next time lol
Just put totems in the cows' mouths and push them off the edge
Disappointed , there’s no beds.   P.S, this is just a joke, don’t take it to seriously the build was actually really really good and impressive.
The raid didn't start, because there was no bed. No bad = no village = no raid
Can't wait to log into 2b2t and fall through the void because everyone tries this
THE SCENE WITH THE COWS AHAHAHAHAHA
Would water and lava clashing make an actual platform at the bottom?
I feel sorry for TPS

why not use pistons to push blocks down and when the max block limit is reached for that 1 piston, jump down and repeat
Make a darkness mob trap and have villagers at the bottom for flint for arrows. Put the loot drops into a water drop system to fall from above nether to the boats for pickup...best to always have arrows and repairs
Use shulkers to shoot you back up??
How do you only have six videos but I did subscribe and like❤
I actually have a crush on him, just watching this. People playing Minecraft are just... appealing to me
don't wanna be that guy but.... Try to craft something.
Happy to say I’m in the 500k club, subbed at 429 😎
Mobs don‘t moo-ve down there 🐮
To be able to start a raid, you need at least one villager and a bed. And because you can’t bring the bed to the void you can’t start a raid(but I wonder what would happen in the nether?).
I have the ticket
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
oo diamonds proceeds to blow it up
funny how diamonds are like nothing now
The shulkers were able to see you because you touched them, this happens with other mobs while your invisible as well.

Bro and the mod you used? Where is it?
Minecraft Mr.beast
In the latest version, the thing where mobs take a bunch of built up fall damage on leads was fixed, so you don’t need slow falling for them.
you would you would need a whole village to start a raid
hi
This is so cool :0✨✨
Couldn't you have just dropped a layer of sand on the shulkers? To not get shot and have a secure standing area?
I have a creative world from 1.18 and because of the 1.19 update I can now build in the void.

Hey I got clickbaited yet im not mad its a good base
500k club fr ⁉️
I was actually expecting you to drop sand or use pistons to push blocks down, since if sand despawns at a certain depth like scaffolding, then you could push stone with a pile of sand on top, and all the sand will despawn, leaving only the stone at the bottom. No idea if pistons fail to push into the void though. Never tried it.
I panicked a little bit when he dropped that elytra and the rockets
1:55 Shulker was just doing its job.
Dude you made a debug room
2.6 MILL for a rip-off video NICE Y’all!

Is glavel or sand work? Instead using boat?
Make more videos I love your stuff
So how are the villagers going to restock
“It might not seem like it but this video took forever” bro this video seems like it would have taken a decade to make - it’s so well thought out and also edited in an engaging way!  Great video dude!
The fact that this is one of his first few videos is crazy. The video quality is like hes been in the game for years
Came here from TikTok, it's a shame videos like these with little credit get millions of views
This video has given me more anxiety than a final exam.
really cool video
Congratulations you played yourself 😐
I don’t believe you did this.

i sub at 424k
i think u misspoke srry 8:40
I have joined the 500K club
I think that dude never closes his minecraft
9:35 why did that made me laugh xD
Dude’s editing is so clean
I just thought that void in minecraft is like a cosmic space in real-life. Feels good to see you exploring it. Just like it was intended but... not 'that' level of 'intended' where it's so easy for everyone and guaranteed to be possible, it's a real challenge.
The amount of time of playing and editing all this is ridiculous 🤯
Wow
I subscribed
Your potential is amazing

Wow
You sound like Neil the Jew from family guy
IM IN
Good video
i subcribed
I SUBSCRIBEDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Bro you could've just made a mob farm then added water so that it can come down to the void but anyways great video!
You earn a sub, I usually don't subscribe to Minecraft youtuber, I can count to 1 hand how many minecraft youtubers I subscribe too, like Mumbo, and Grian
putting gravel blocks would not have been enough on the shulkers box? And to lower the animals, put them in the boats and then bring the boat down with it, a cow for example, wouldn't that have been easier? Or impossible because of the boats already present? 🤷 I didn't really understand what happened next when he didn't move, but the problem must be related to the question I asked, I imagine. So sorry if the answers to my questions are in the video, I suck at English when it's not in writing, and still not even writing I use Google translation... ^^
500K club
Yo! I'm part of the 500k Club!
I don't think the animals move in the void because their AI isn't meant to move down there. (I think)
now im part of the before 500k people yay
great work but of you have to remember to have your bow wouldnt be easier to just remember to have your elytra on?
NOOO DAM YOU, I have to choose a new minecraft skin 😭😭
Dude, this is freaking insane! The amount of dedication and quality that goes into your vids is insane. I can easily see you as one of the next top Minecraft Creators and if anyone says otherwise, they're blind. Another thing, how do you manage to do all of this when you still go to school?! Like WHAT?
no cows were harmed in the filming of this
You should’ve used the crossbow instead, it shoots farther!
Bro sounds like the nerd emoji 🤓🤓🤓
I’m apart of the 500k sub club!
You can use sand to make it fall
Before 500k
No bed tho
well, now no one will find my base on 2b2t xDD
This is the definition of I have too much free time and I have no life HAHAHAHA
Joke is on you I built a void base under the end on Xbox 360 in the end back in 2013 and mine was way better and bigger because you can actually build there with any block but water
2019: I built my house in the void 😀 2022: Now I'm going to update the game to the new cave update! 😀 (💀)
And this is one of your FIRST videos?!
Space Valkria 3, to my knowledge, didn’t have a mob farm…

I don’t even play minecraft and this video was so enjoyable

The problem with the mushroom cow is that the bowl you use disappears after one use so you would need infinite wood
I didn't think half of those things would be posible but wait, weren't you supposed to take damage in the void?

Bad omen did not work because you need to be in a village to trigger it.  A village is 1 villager and 1 bed.

You could argue the thumbnail is clickbait, but this is the rare time the actual video is COOLER than the thumbnail lmao
THE DIAMONDS, YOU MONSTER!!!  Still subscribed tho  :D
I just watched 18minutes just to see that you clickbaited me with your thumbnail??
you should have put the cows in boats
u forgot a bed
This might be one of the most impressive Minecraft grinds I’ve ever seen
What is that new black stone?
click bait
AH HA CHINESE WACKY!
10:50 in java a player with bad omen can only start a raid by entering a chunk with at least one villager and claimed bed or bell. since there was no bed i'm assuming that's why it didn't work, but maybe its just the void cause i'm not familiar with how raid mechanics work under those conditions :D
500k club LET'S GOOOOOO

6:45 he sounds like PewDiePie :D
i remember watching some vid about how to make medieval homes back in 1.8, its insane how players evolve and push minecraft to the absolute limit

Props to you man you only have like 5 videos each with an insane amount of views and you have half a million subs well-done bro.
I was here
Bro used potion of invisibility but forgot to remove items from hands. That's the reason he got hited by shulkers. Bruh...
Since the scaffolding breaks slightly above the ground of the base, what if you piled on more boats on top of each other until you reach the level where blocks don't break?
Bro how you go that many subs from 7 video can anyone explain me
Hopefully Ph1lza finds this video.
Bro he blows up the dimons and wen he was not recording he was crying

At 8:47 he said llama instead of donkey by mistake
i was in the 100k club!
Proud 500k club member
I WILL BE HERE HILL 500K WOOOOO
Who else thought that he could have placed one shulker, dropped some sand down and then placed something on top, making it so that he could build infinitely without needing all the shulkers and hassle
I need to remind myself that minecraft players exist whenever I'm doing anything psychotic adjacent
O LETS GO IM PART OF THE BEFORE 500K PARTY!
Love voice
llama has more ? donkey y  u mean im kidding we all mess up
Seems like a base to... a void.

I can't believe you're a beginner, your contents so fun! I like youtubers who compact absurd amounts of gameplay into small videos
Ohio?
It's crazy
omg u are legend
What if your pc crashes while you're in the void base? You're dead right?

U can put like 4 chests on sniffer provided uh the sniffing adds a little excitement cuz it sounds like warden.
Yo in thumbnail you show a diamond pic but you were holding firework in inventory and there is a netherite pic in your inventory
im in the 500k club (:
You could drop water and build platform more ez
So uh how do the villagers restock  Same reason why they didn't spawn a raod: they need a workstation
Cool
Bruh the fact that he did not see the Wondering trailer
here before 500k  swag
No entendí ni mierda :v
so esperando o viniccius 13 fazer tbm kkk
Ok, eu assisti todo esse vídeo entendendo poucas palavras
Bro used fucking creatures for a platform💀
Fun fact: every time the community discovers something fun the devs "fix" it. Yes I am still bitter about the removal of redstone dust to obsidian conversion.
Do you just have 6 videos???????????????
Did you know you are crazy
immpossible
lets appreciate the fact he timed the music with the blocks breaking 9:20 9:26

I claim my before 500k ticket
Dec 16, 2022 10 48 pm At 3:04 I paused so I can grab some marshmallows to enjoy the rest of this video
Would the shulkers despawn or not
Him: a lama only has three slots, me: sees six… who’s stoopid now😂
hella respect your editing 💯! very impressive
Bro is legit an engineer and a maniac at the same time
bro was holding a diamond pickaxe that he didnt have lol
the fact that this guy managed to make it big with 7 Minecraft videos makes my mind blow. I wonder if he'd have any tips for me.
part of the 500k early club
A Lama can have the Same storage capacity as a donkey but it’s super rare to find them
the reason the raid didnt spawn is bc there wernt 2 villagers and beds
is saying "shelkers" like an inside joke or something
I just watched a video made by your enemy
Wait
you lied about the ghast at the end
insane w
Good video
This makes me realise how lacking my base actually is
This video is the definition of underrated.
The lamas actually have either 3,6,9,12 or 15 slots, which is random (not sure if inheritable) and the more the rarer
Why build your base with blocks when you can get entities to do it for you.
This man knew exactly what he was doing when he made this channel and started uploading. He’s going to be fucking huge
Am I trippin but why does he have grass blocks? 10:12
10:57 I heard: "I want two Liberians for books."
the reason u cant start a raid in the void u need a bell plus u cant put one
500k club
When you said you only had 6 videos before this one. I was like, oh man the Minecraft meta is insane for the YouTube algorithm
this is wild
I was here when you were 240k subs bro I hope you get 10 mil because you are a great youtuber
the way you say shulker annoys me sm
Wait, is this really 6th video of this guy and he started from 0?
You have great energy and skills I'm subbing keep doing this
@Sonder
Now do this is 2b2t 💀
Why is he so funny
U earned my respect for the Hardwork and a new Subscriber....❤️

"In order to get back up, i just need to bring my elytra and frieworks. But what If i forget them? *Builds some redstone* Now i just need to bring my bow and arrows" 🤯😂😌
Yeahhhh, our legend is back
Holy shit, you are insane man. Good job editing, very fun video.
lammas can actually contain the same inventory as a donkey, however it requires lots of selective breeding to work, basically, if 2 of the same inv space lamas breed, there is a small chance the offspring will have more slots then their parents, breed 2 different ones and its a 50/50, so basically lots of breeding = small chance of max lamma  thank you for coming to my ted talk
Subbed before 500k
4:43 You do not understand the stress that gave me.
Im here since the beggining

Reminded me of Grians Tea Party in the void video

You crazy lad, i once dreamed like making a spiral staircase in the void
So you can't get a crafting table in the void?
500k gang
I’m in the 500k club I guess
Why didn’t you just place normal block on side of shulker or waterfall down so no suffer
Why do you have normal health at 0:38?  Are you cheating?
this video has a gurren lagann vibe, doing the impossible (a base in the void) and the obligatory 14:45 (who the hell do you think i am?)

Welp hello everyone who is part of 500 k!!!
Guess I'm part of the 500K club now, feels good
The Shulker don't attack your when there is a boat on it because the make stop the shulker from opening itself to shoot you
Fun fact wandering traders will always despawn unless you use a command to modify their nbt data
11:55 why are those commands on screen 🤨
Your dog is not a dog this is a cat
No enchanting table? No crafting table? No BED?!
This guy needs to be an engineer

Not hating just wanna ask why you in survival at the start the content is still fun to watch so I don't mind if it's fakr
The fact that it literally takes 1 minecraft update for the whole base to breack down
You have done a lot of hardwork ..
How does he only have 7 videos but has 400k subs?

Been here since 300k 😤
Nice
some one stole ur vid posting on facebook
Nice approach, but you over complicated the process a lot) you can go building downwards using trapdoors) Can give you a link if you wish.
Can you show how you build the Red Szene breaker
All of his videos have over a million views

You need to start a crazy craft series

I'm kinda mad he didn't use the shulkers, the one thing that was so annoying, to get back up. If he made a shulker elevator where he would consistantly get hit by shulkers, it would be much easier
I like this guy more than MrBeast not really but yeah I like them
yo actually cool idea

500K gang
500k gang 👇
Some time ago, I  used to play on a random server with quite alot of people, I was the most op one,  like nobody had diamond armor, or netherite except me and he admin. So, I went hella far to mine diamonds with silktouch and place them everywhere so people would find them ,mannually built a few caves with spawners( no mob spawner but only loot chests) and other ores. Made 1×1 copy of a temple so people would find and loot it, and replacing the looted chests and rebuilding everything. Put better loot în village chests, level up the villagers so they had more trades. Also build 2 blacksmiths,  ruined portals with the needed amount of obsidian to rebuild them. I did build other small structures and replanted trees everywhere. I also put a few diamonds , totems and rarely a netherite ingot în peoples chests, nobody ever found out who was doing all thaf cause  I only was online at 4 or 3 am, cause dobody was online at that time. Stopped doing it Last week because some hackers destroyed the server.
4:43  Did he just drop his ENCHANTED elytra în the damn void💀
what about sand and grawel

hey bro, some guy named sirswagulhuis or something is stealing your content and putting it on ticktok, if he isnt asking for permission then you should probably get intact with him. also like the vid 😀
500k club💪
This base is better than my actual one..
Watch end so bruh :)))
Lol what's 😄😄😄😄
10:30 you need beds to start raid as without bed, minecraft donot consider it as a village 😅
Something about this feels disingenuous
You did in survival what mysticat did with commandblocks
The fact that his game didn't crash at all during recording WHILE running mods is amazing
17:48
I got a mooshroom island in my survival world like 1000 blocks from spawn and it was so small it had one mushroom and one cow LMFAO
17.48
bro grande
Oh my God I am one I am so good that is I am so good at this just liking your videos every day but guess what this was only 13 days ago
the fact you literaly did the same thumbnail mysticat and mysticat did this earlier
The pillagers didn’t spawn because the villagers don’t have a bed
Im here before 500k
WOW  HAHAHAHA It's Insine !
What a good job. I subscribe
Can you try to make 100 days in the void base?
invis decreases aggro range. wearing armour makes you visible. You aren't truly invis
His voice and how he speak kinda cute
Perfecto
dayum
Bro i love your content and you need do upload more sussy vids heh
You could just get cows in to boats and to start raid you need to have "village", min. 3 villagers with beds
Nice

Hi
so i og???
“The llama only has three chest slots” *um according to my calculations that is six*

Was the thumbnail stolen from mysticat?
I can’t stop 😂 every time he said stupid
I find it funny that he used Hermitcraft bases for his 'greatest bases'
500k> Gang
STOLEN FROM MYSTICAT?
Didn't mysticat already do this?
2 wandering trader came to my house
I got a mushroom island with a jungle next together spawn
the villagers will run out because they cant restock items so they will become useless aftet some use
I'm confused why did he keep spaces between the shulkerboxes and didn't make a platform?
calling it now, you’re the next big thing
This will blew up Take your og december 4th ticket here
I have no idea how he’s not popular his videos are so good
Mobs have a pathfinding ai which goes to a full block. Since there are no full blocks in the void, they do not move to a full block and just stay still.
Eu simplesmente adoro assistir isso, mesmo sem entender nada
8:18 but because you cant place shelkers or chests down there
He sounds similar to boosfer
How are you not taking damage in the void?????!!!
How is that even possible lol what
but you now taht you can not even trade with them twice?  (they need to have acces to ther working station)
How doesn't he die
It's fucking ugly
nice video man!

Yo I’ll sub to u if u tell me what editing software u use and whether it is free or not. Thanks, great vid btw
Not only you put a lot of effort into this but your also risking it and your stuff, because well if the shulker floating in the void is fixed it's all done for. But still Great Work! I am impressed

The raid didn’t happen because the villagers don’t have workstations, so the void base doesn’t count as a village

Damn man, I thought you were a very popular YouTuber until you point out the fact you only had 5 videos. You’ll definitely get popular very soon.
I have watched all of your videos and thougth that they were of differents youtubers until now
500K fav lets go
First video I've ever seen from you and I already cannot stop watching...
Im fairly certain that raids only start near villages, not just villagers
Very nice videos! Continue uploading!
Good video
Minecart rails also block mob detection...
Thank you for pointing that arrow to you at  00:27 otherwise I wouldn’t see you
gg
Pls make walls with minecarts
Your villagers can't restock though, because they have no workstations lol. Very funny "base" though
You can put chests on boats...
Carvs: ah... yes, if I'm invisible they can't see me. Also Carvs: 'holding items in both hands'
12:40 and the Czech people right now: těžit nekonečně houbové polívky🤣

The anxiety during this video was amazingly high.
Did you try using gravel or sand instead of boats ?

That worth a like im so fucking sure
I love how in the thumbnail, he has a diamond pickaxe in his hand, but in his hot bar in the thumbnail, he has an enchanted netherite pickaxe and sword… hmmm… 🧐 I think he was really going crazy at 4am during this process… Also, the fact that the “pet dog” is a cat had me cracking up.
I do not kill pigs dod
Imagine he forgot a second elytra💀

You are very smart!
hilarious video to watch, incredibly well done sir <3
Since the beginning!

10:53 raids only happen in villages. one villager in the void is not a village
8:31 untrue. a llamas inventory is dependent on its strength level. you can breed llamas to get better ones and the max is equal to a donkey
Just use a auto flyer to get the blocks down?
Are you serious are you kidding Me this video is perfect
You're insane bro, ur cutting is so good as well, 300k gang 😁
He's really lucky because a lot of mushroom islands don't spawn mooshrooms
no offence you are stupid it is MUTCH rarer to not have a mooshroom island
u kinda give me beppo vibes lol, just the way you talk and the editing style
You need more subscribers for what you have.
I been at YouTube for 2 years and I have posted 20 videos but I only have 47 subs

Why the clickbait base in the thumbnail?
I love how this dude casually does the most insane thing ever IN SURVIVAL and just excuses it as the most normal process ever
unfortunately, unless you have some sort of mod your wandering tader is gonna despawn even if nametaged, in other words you wasted 6 hours for nothing
The void is the most unsettling part of Minecraft for me, I hate empty dark places, feels like a giant hand could grab me at any time lol.

Great interesting video but clickbait
How did you get so many subscribers only 7 videos
Here sense the beginning
Bro why did you blow up the diamonds
Genuine question, if you're still in school, how do you have time to record and edit videos (tips/tricks?)
Witchcraft
instead of using your bow to get out use the minecart elevator it works
I think the reason why the shulker can’t see you is because of the weight the boat keeps the box shit
Keep up on the good videos!

I liked the video and everything on it, but i have a little and useless question. How in the void he doesn't have any damage falling into the void??
Just one thing missing, a crafting table
I wish the platform was blocks

Could you build a flying machine/elevator that pushes blocks down into the void and have an actual floor? Maybe even a decent house?

Llama storage varies and some can have as many as 15 storage slots. And you can breed two of those together and their baby llama will also have 15 storage slots.
Pretty sure the shulkers could still see you because you still had the totem in your hand.

Wandering traders are useful. It's how I get to the nether in Skyblock.
The wandering trader spawned in before you noticed him. Watch back the footage if you don’t believe me

epic base
Can't believe you didn't know the basic stuff like mobs floating on the lead accumulate fall damage. Also a villager without a job site block doesn't count as a village, so no raid's spawning. And the wandering trader despawns no matter what, nametag does nothing. Aside from that good job!
i subbed
i love it when he says *stuped!*
You definitely deserve tons of likes and subscribers
Then you realize the villagers cant reset their trades…

You can also potentially use a shulker's levitation effect to go back up
I hope Mojang can do a void update, maybe creating an island and some mods there
You can make a boat staircase to get up instead of using an enderpearl stasis chamber. Or some sort of boat ladder

Hey carvs, two things! One, you cannot restock those villagers trades without their work station so they're kinda useless, and two, you should look into making a minecart elevator to get in and out of your base! I'm not sure if it would work but it's worth a shot!

Name tags and boats do not prevent wandering traders from despawning.
this is wonderful.
8:41 a llama has way more
Mushroom Islands arnt actually that rare, it just seems rare because it only can spawn in ocans and has a visually low chance but when you have 20,000,000 x 20,000,000 blocks to check you can find one pretty quick.

Here to collect the <500k ticket 😎 (your vids are genuinely great tho im definitely subbing)
Correction on the Llama thing: Llamas don't *only* have 3 storage space, they instead have an invisible stat (The name of which I forget) which can be any number between 1 and 5. The stat's value is the number of rows of 3 items they can hold, so, a Llama with a stat of 1 can hold 3 items, stat of 2 is 6 items, and so on, until 15 item slots at 5 (Still worse than Donkeys though because I'm pretty sure Donkeys have 5 by default)
The amount of Dedotated wam in this video was amazing, so much dedotachon
u should have just stacked minecarts to get up

But instead of 3 slots the lhama has a lot more XD
below 500k gang! love seeing you grow man. love ya!
ive been here since 10k and you improved so much man
The fact that he wasted an elytra just for us.
A base without a bed isn't a base for me ... disliking + unsub
this base looks better then mine HOW DID YOU GET EVERY THING I DID NOT HAVE IN MY BASE
imagine you had to feed your shulkers or they'd die ... and ur base would fall
make a cat
INSANE
It’s a mooshroom… not a mooshroom cow…
You should have made the mooshrooms brown for suspicious stew
348ksubscriber is me
And part of the 500k🍪
lol i have wath mintx and he iss tellig dat you is a smart minecraft player😎😎
who are the stupid 705 people that didn't like this video

i really appreciate your videos you put a lot of effort into them
Idea:shulker boat stairs
I was here
500k gang less go
I’m here 500k club
why u dont put on armour stand elitra and in the minecaarts rockets
He really tricked me wen he threw his elytra and rockets
Fun fact: breaking the fall of a mob will not reduce the fall damage it will just stack up even more
i subscribed
the hotbar item and the hand item are different
Imagine if he actually made one wrong step there, imao.
yayayayay!!!111!!! im apart of the 500k club!!!!1111!!!!!111
Never thought watching some1 build a base would be fun until this
Ок
nice one
I subbed at 347k!!
Your stuff is insane
how do u hav 300k subs with only 7 videos?!
The reason the raid thing didn’t work is because for it to work you need a villager AND a bed
u got chestt with boats u dumb
subscribed:D
what i this in 8:16
The sholker saw you cuz you're holding something
Crazy dedication
I like the video, it's fun but it goes so fast and seems so unnatural its hard to enjoy aside from the initial wow factor that quickly dies and wanting to see the end result, definitely could be better
Imagine he accidentally delete this video before uploading the sufferness is unimaginable
Here before 500k
Dude, stop using notification sounds whenever you accomplish something. Mostly forget the idiot teams notification sound!!!! Video is interesting, but these are frikin annoying. I’ll block your channel the next vid I hear them.
lol
,:100🤭🤔👏😅
the reason as to why mobs don't move when they're in the void, it's because they can't pathfind into full blocks
500k clubb
Every inch of this video had me splitting my house in half by laughing

Getting a mushroom biome is that rare? I swear that every other world I've been in had one a short journey from spawn.
Bro the amount of suffering.. I'm subbing
This video is amazing! New sub
The villagers need their workstation to restock. So it's useless
Probably a dumb question.. but can sand land on top of the shulker boxes?

Well, that earned you a new subscriber. :-) I wonder what the goat thinks about this though.
500k club
New subscriber I hope you get 500k!! When I got recommended this video I clicked on it because it’s something different (don’t really watch MC YouTube but I play it) I finished the video and was really expecting you to have at least a million subs. Keep up the good work and you’ll be there in no time. The level of content, dedication, and editing is up there with all the other YouTubers (millions of subs) with similar videos as you
Woowoo
RESPECT
lkadwmlmkawdlkmadwkmakmwdlkmlwawadwdawawddwaadwdaw
Build this in 2b2t
You said Shuckers instead of shockers is this your nickname for that block 8:19
10:53 1 villager isn't a village you need beds and profession blocks to make it a village
9:16 they don't look better
To get down you should have just placed lava and once it flows down you could put water and make cobblestone and made a way  to place ladders xD😂😂😂😂 (I tried it in a test world)
This guys made 6 videos and has managed to get 342k subs. Well deserved tho
you got it late in the game when i one time got it at spawn
You are insane
pre 342k gang
I just subbed! When you said you had 6 videos I just realised how cool it is that your making videos of this quality already!
I think he watched Mysticat to make this video
Actually fun fact. Llamas can have up to 15 slots but each llama spawn has different odds of inventory slots!
The villagers won’t be able to restock and the wandering trader will despawn
"Just some simple Redstone" yea ok
Nice.
Comment
Wait until he finds out that the wandering trader despawns no matter whether or not it is nametagged or in a boat
Now do this in 2B2T and recruit your subscribers to make the biggest army in the world.  Edit: Honestly a joke. It’s not possible to do that much in a pvp survival. Most likely the base will get griefed. I can’t even do redstone lol.
From which game is that short alert sound? I knoow it, but cant remember from which game :X Pleeasee help me :D EDIT: is it Enter the gungeon? It is,...isnt it?!
He only has 7 vids in one year lol
6 Videos!

I just think it's really sad when people like you are so lazy and don't want to put the work in 😉
Carvs u could just use chest boat

Very nice video
500k club!
Wow, epic video!
The cows can’t moove

To get up just drop more boats and make a staircase
Subbing and excited to see you grow!
They need a claimed bed and a workstation for a raid to start.
Keep going bro your going places
he didnt want to use boats to drop the cows, he wanted to justify the slow fall xd
nice
You work so hard on your base becarful?
❤❤❤❤ I like your channel keep making videos!!!❤❤❤❤❤😊
17:35 where is the entertainment?

0:38 Harcore HUH?
ur dedication is incredible!
amazing vid. keep it up
Make a hole and wait for the rain to use the tridents riptide
Can we not use lava and water to reach the void as water will convert lava into cobblestone?             (Please reply)
hii love the videos
can you please tell me the sfx at 0:34 and 0:33
I’m sorry but the wondering trader disappears after like 40 min.
Remember to get the diamonds back when you leave the base.
I am one of the 500k's
Not only are you impressive but your hilarious, too, you deserve this sub bro!😂👍🏻
I was here before he got to 1 million subs.
13:26 to 13:35 is the stress machine
It feels lonely making base in void

Carvs should do hypixel skyblock
Me: instead of just using shoulkers for the whole entire floor just put on sand then put on grass and then make the whole entire Island simple.
Bro I know u this is not one of your first videos u privated them all
Before 400k
Check your wandering trader because it disappears even with a name tag after 30 minutes lol it’s the only mob as well as you didn’t even notice it was gone you cant beat the WANDERING trader lol 😂
Carvs doesn’t upload often but when he uploads it’s always a banger.

pog
Be dumb don't subscribe
Bro has infinity IQ
Very nice videos
So interesting! I wonder how long it actually took to finish the void base
It’s probably because shulkers are different from other mobs because they also act as a block that you can stand on but idk why
8:58 1.19 boats
The thumbnail seems familiar... *Caught * *Mysticat * *Cought *
Well done!!🖤😻
yes
Your videos are really cool😋👍

You impressed me

I subscribed :D
10:59 the raid didn’t work for 2 reasons. 1, there was not enough villagers, you need 3. 2, you had no beds for the villagers.
Finally a YouTuber that works hard
8:43 you mean a donkey has way more?
How are animals not entering the boats…?
Hey can you give me a shout out in your next vid cuz I’m also a YouTuber. I’m Cain Playz

When ou frist started to get cows down I thought of the idea for slow fall
I like yours vid

Dude how do you have so many subs tho only have 6 vids
333k Gang Where Yall At
legit every house in ohio
Real original thumbnail 👍🏻
i subed before 500k
the reason a raid didn't spawn was because it wasn't a "village" a villager needs to have a certain amount of villagers around it to spawn iron golems and raids.
A LAMA HAS 3 MORE LMAO 8:39
500k club
Holy crap. Subbed just because I have always wanted this to be a thing, you're the first one to have done it on a satisfying scale

You can place a mob in the boat with a chest and not be with risk because you wont need to shift
8:30 6 slots "is... it only has [3] inventory slots." 8:39 it's a donkey "chest on it. But instead of only having 3 slots, a [Llama] has waaay more." 12:29 just a Mooshroom. No mooshroom COWS. "because apparently, they're actually called Mooshroom [cow]?"
I’m here and subbed
i hate you. donky abuse.

Day 1 Of Trying To Get Pinned.
2:25 Be careful I think you can fall in between the boats.
Before 500k
i think you need 2 villagers and 1 iron golem to be considered a village to spawn a raid
its just mooshroom not mooshroom cow
500k club
500k gang!
330k sub
or you can break a boat and let the shulckers (how the hell do you even spell that) float your way to the top
to start a raid the villager has to have a bed nearby. also there has to be multiple villagers for it to be considered a village.
why did you not place the animals in the boats and why did you not use boat with chest to walk on and use
cool
I’m part of 500k club!!!!!!!!
500k gang
Bro base in the void 💀
Bro deserve one more subscriber!
You can use chess boats instead of minecarts!!!😂😂😂😂
#before500k gang Now heart my comment dummy

FYI, it’s not mooshroom cow, it’s just mooshroom
let's make a thing  to remeber us as the first ones like commenting somthing to show we were here at the bigining
me am are beta subber
The villager didnt have a bed so the raid system didnt recognize it as a village.
He uploaded lets go I’m from the beginning
That’s impressive
500k club yey
13:00 That’s what she said
Is it just me, or couldn't of you just sent an ender man holding a grass block down there... he would eventually drop it.
sus
He saw the walking trailer at 15 minutes and 14 seconds in
I have a idea  for youYou can just put a bow in your storage and name it escape
he should use boats instead of slowfalling
Why did you remove all your old smp content from your channel?
YOU FORGOT MINECARTS

Villagers need beds to start a raid. (1 bed and 1 villager will count as a village)
can you shout me out plsss i want a youtube rank in Hypixel
Man once my brother builded a castle and I was thinking it was cool but my man the monstrosity of build you made is next level.RESPECT
Gg
Only OGS know this is a re-upload
The reason the void raid didn't start is because for it to be considered a village it needs a bed and villager and since beds can't be placed in the void it's impossible Also very entertaining, amazing video keep up the great work
Copied thumbnail from mysticat but legit
It's Just Mooshroom not Mooshroom cow
Lol you gave cat slowly  falling can't  do not take fall damage XD
Noice you survived 4am lol

Still a great youtuber
Now we wait for 10 years for one video

Raids doesn't only need villager to trigger. It needs atleast one villager claiming the bed. If all the conditions are meet then Raid will trigger
Congratulations it’s been 5:40 pm Wednesday 23 November how much time did you take that🎉🎉🎉
Chunk corruption could allow you to build below the void if you updated, but great job anyways man!
i have been subscribed to him on his first video i think it was a powder snow video

Hi
Here before 500K 👇
I subscribed at 325K subscribers
ok i know u had a spare elytra but u should prob keep it, but its too late know
I think we should respect this dude a lot because he puts so much effort into his vids
Sheeeeeeeeesh jit krazy
for storage use boat  with chest
Subbed!
What if you miss the bow and kill the mobs like the wandering trader
8:05 "they can't MOOve"
I hear by the start
Keep up the great work Carvs!!!!!!!!
Villagers won’t work bc they don’t have workstations
Your so under rated bro… your him!!!!!
⬇️500K Club Ticket
OG FAN TICKET
THIS IS EPIC
The one time you actually want wandering traders they hide
This is crazy
You could try hanging boats with leads then using them like a boat ladder or stairs
I you  Videos
Man said that llamas have not much but on the donkey  he said llama lol
Lesss go I’m in the 300k gang CLAIMED!!
4:47 well if he rly didnt have elytra and rockets, he can break the boat and let the shulker hit him all the way up although idk if the shulker reach is far enough.
what do you use to edit and make your videos @Carvs ?
I am subed
"oo diamonds"  *blows it up 2 seconds later*
Why would u throw a Sierra into the void
Im here before 10 videos ticket, also here before 500k, also before 400k also before 8 videos
Claim ur here before 500K mega Chad collectible ticket
Im wondering if you can get out of the void using stacked boats or minecarts
I think I have be sub for 5 months
The fact that his void base is better than my actual base is kinda crazy
500K CLUB!!!!!!!!!
YOU STOLE FROM MYSTICAT
"The first ever void farm and probably the last, because no one would be stupid enough to do this except me" too late
I shoot minecraft memes, but no one is watching ((((([
What happens if you ran out of arrows and bows? 6:28
8:41 donkey not llama
I'm in the 500k club...
325k club
2:00😂😂
bro with tis you should do surviving 100 Days in a void Base only. To make it more intresting you could copy the base into another world and a a modd that adds things to the vois.  great vid by the way!!!
Super cool video
bro only has 6 vids and alredy got 20 mil vidws
He forgot the bed
The fact he threw a elytra in the void for that 1 scene is just mad
i might do this with shelkers
Bro has 6 videos but 300k subs
500k gang were u at
8:20 what is a shelker?
9:40 me in a nutshell
i have to Sub after that
the impossible has been donne
The villager had no bed No bed No raid
insert text here
Raids require villages, which require villagers _with workstations!!!!!!!!_
Bro can’t count it has 6 not 3
The Void Base is so cool!
I’m part of the 500k club lets go
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BUT YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A PLANE
Geek city.
Crazy!
8:33 bro killed the rarest form of those chest Llama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWncGUb-dGc
OOOOO DIAMONDS *puts tnt like its nothing*
Ye
pls give metipsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
6:00 or just use the shulker to levitate
He calls a shulker a shelker lol
ive seen that thumbnail before.....
Hii before 500K
Hi therealcarvs
nice how you steal @mysticat's thumbnail and claim it as your own
Good job on building your base in the void
in the 500k club
Its been a while since ive seen a new idea as innovative as this in the Minecraft youtube realm lol - this is such a cool concept, loved the video!
whats the song at the end?
im from before 300k im at the VERY beginning
Bro does ho ho ho better than santa
322k
7.33 he realised
and I am part of the 500k club LOL
You should have done the scaffolding on top of the shulker instead of on top of the boat
322k
Bruh why do you think you have a animal farm 12:03
Wood ??
so good I subbed
Hi
Hi
You're mentally unstable  Anyway i subscribed
U CROUCH WITH 4!!!
Sb's also did that a year ago.
I'm Japanese and I don't understand foreign languages, but I found this video very interesting.
Lol
15:13  There is clearly a wandering trader
I just found out about this channel, pretty insane work.  One suggestion would be to add a chunk reload detection system with a frost walker armor stand to the ender pearl stasis chamber, that way even if you log out at the base you get teleported back up when you relog (of course might be worth testing first).
Why’d you blow up the diamonds
Who's waiting for Mysticat to slide here
I like how he built a trading hall when he can’t place jobsites
I am your big fan can u promote my channel plssss??
...
The quality is really good for a youtube with only 5 vids I subbed
Reply to this comment with things that took you an embarrassing amount of time to figure out.  Me: "desert" and "dessert" aren't spelled the same way Carvs: mushroom cows are actually called mooshroom
I literally just subbed so does that mean i am in? ???
Hello
If you put more chests you can actually make a wall for your void base
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂 You. R.  funny
Shoot the target block with my bow
If you didnt name the chickens they will despawn
i like how was like oo diamonds aw dangit🤣 it blew up
I know this is his 6th video but gosh damm I love this guy!
deja vu
My man is back online
Wooow thats so amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I
I subscribed 5 months ago
him: oooo diamonds *explodes it* got me died💀
You couldnt get a raid in the void becausebyou need a couple villagers to start one insted of just one
Claim your " before 1 day ticket here
Yay
I am so, so proud of you for not trapping your enemies.
You could have a snowman in the base to mine snowballs to shoot the target, that way you wouldn't need to worry about arrows  Or, more effort, a mob spawner above the base
I like how much time you pur into ur videos keep up the good work
do a tutorial please
I JOIN THE 500 K CLUB!!
you could you minecarts as stair cases
The outline of the base looks like a hammer
Good video (: keep it up
The lama can have more slots actually
There is another way, if u first use newer versions, then build above the new void height, then turned into an older version, your base might be in the void
dude, you’re totally underrated, this is awesome!!
at 4:06 you can see a diamond
So I'll be an og later in later
Wow
Yes, mushroom cows are in fact called mooshrooms.
Im watching ppl have the luxury of minecraft java edition while i dont even have enough money to buy it😭 Also i love it🤌
This is crazy
I just subscribed love your content and love your videos! Very funny!
Plz upload videos 1 week plz
One /kill @e and its completely gone
"just like a llama you can put a chest on it, but instead of only having three spots a llama has way more" thats uhh... a really uhh.. odd looking llama (8:36)
I am an og now.
OMG
Your videos are cool!
Dada dadadadadada dada dadadadadada
CJL wanna be
👍
loll love how he just made a communita meme of the horn xDDD
mysticat be like
Wow finally 😊
For the way to get up and down, you could’ve broken the boats on one shulker and dropped scaffolding on there. I’m pretty sure the scaffolding only broke because it wasn’t on a full block
New sub here
*in a nerdy voice* actually the mooshroom cow is not called a mooshroom cow it is actually just called mooshroom
Am I the only one who subbed at 30k 😅
Im in 500k club *flex*
I remember when you had only 2 vids  I subscribed cuz I knew there was boing to be more quality and I don’t regret at all
I mean he stole a thumbnail from mysticat, but I'm down to watch this
I was watching your chalale sence your frust video
10:14 WHY DIDNT YOU DO THAT FOR THE COWS!
Yeah I'm part of the 500K club
Minecraft Deja vu
Mysticat did this first but in creative
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Mew subscriber
You have 7 video not six
Btw I subbed
But maybe since u said if u logged of or something uh will die so maybe that's why🤔
Hmm you said everything's done what about the fking bed?
I’m a before 500 k gang
Banger carvs video as always
Expenation for all this is the entire base uses entity’s which only get hurt in the void below y -128 and -64 in pre 1.18 this also is why the cows don’t move all non flying mobs look for blocks to move to but because the boats and shulkers are entities not blocks they don’t see anything to move to so they just don’t. That is why the scaffolding didn’t work. Great video! :)
Before 500k ticket lets go
500k TICKET AQUIRED

Misty moment
cool and good video, one small problem.....                                                    "Fat Man" (also known as Mark III) is the codename for the type of nuclear bomb that was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki by the United States on 9 August 1945. It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site, and it was dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar piloted by Major Charles Sweeney.  The name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape. Fat Man was an implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the Trinity nuclear test less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.
I love ur videos I was at school throw sorry
You can start a raid in the void, you need to let the villager pick and assign to a bed, then drop the villager in the void. If you then start the raid with bad omen, the raid instantly ends in a victory!
Bro... how?

Really cool stuff! Too bad you couldn't start a raid on those villagers (they need at least one bed i think) the result could have been pretty hilarious
you Literally scare me when you throw those two items to the void
Long time no see carvs
if this video get famous dont forget me ok :)
Are you dumb you can put the block under the bedrock if you drop a shulker to the void
i was here bro
The Fletcher in Whiplash?!

Carvs never disappoints to find a new obscure way to build a house.

What's if you are logged off if you are stand inside a bot, please try it maybe Thant then you are logging back you don't fell into the void...? (Maybe)

I like how he walked right by a wondering trader while making the mob farm
Don't be surprised but i got 4 mushroom bioam
Suiiiiiiiiiiiii
I've been here from the beginning from your first video
You need bed and villager to start a raid
