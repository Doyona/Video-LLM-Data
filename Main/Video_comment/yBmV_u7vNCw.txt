Looking forward to a 2025 version! Happy Thanksgiving Chris
I love Christmas. I’m getting a lot of gifts 2025
Coop MVP!! Lmao 🐕
That's not the only one that's tight 😅😂😂😂😂😂🎉
Thank you and your videos.   You are very popular.
These tools might be from 2022, but my car still thinks it's brand new!
just turned 16 and got an old xg falcon ute and I came across your channel must say your videos and advice are much better than my dads😅
Where do you buy your ratchet set
never have i liked a video on youtube so fast until i saw chrisfix in a santa costume
YOU ARE AMAZING!!
how or where do u create urr own books and branding for your own toools, ur racing helmet even lolo, shirts are cool too
BEST!
The Milwaukee m18 tire inflator is the best brand on the market
10:00 steam vacuums are just extractor vacuums on steroids
Xmas 2024? 🙏🥺
We need your 2024 version
17:19 this dude is too funny 😂
whats the point of getting the extractor vac if you can just use the attachment?
It's... August... And I'm looking at Christmas gift ideas... Also this guy is really cool he's like a father figure
I love this guy! So wholesome and straightforward.
The hose on the tire inflator can get hot as you inflate your tire
My Ridgid tire inflator takes 4 minutes to fully inflate a tire from 10-35 psi and the noise level is 80db and my battery will go down 25%
My name is Ibrahim
Chris, with the reverse brake bleeder, how do you get the old brake fluid out? I love your videos and they have taught me to be more willing to work on my Jeep, thank you!
@22:34:  That's an awl.
Where is the Christmas gift ideas video for 2023????
I sent this video to my mom and my grandmother last year when they asked me what i wanted for Christmas. They bought me the Hoover extractor vacuum and the Bissel Steam Shot. They were 100% my favorite gifts of the year and i still use them nearly every day to clean mine and my mom's cars as well as things around the house. Definitely great gifts in this video!
Did anyone remember the derecho
I bought my girlfriend the spray wax ... she was soooo happy.  Until she tried to do a brazilian with it.
Used to get a Harbor Freight breaker bar with a socket in my, and my kid's cars for flats. Got the Breaker bar/Lug wrench. torque wrench for my car. Seems like good quality and is better than just a breaker bar. Thanks, Chris.
omg the face reveal at 1:33 in the book
Chris what power tool brand do you mainly use
I have to sell 4000 books and all these dumb ass tools to break even. Does anyone remember when this guy actually thought us shit?
5:21 that is exacly what this is
Love the book!
Came here for this year’s video ——>
But will there be an 8th year Christmas list? :D
Chrirstas is again coming
Love your content!!! I just bought your book for my nephew’s kids!
Can’t wait to see what’s in store for the 2023 version!!!
Can't wait for this years video
You could make a video on removing and replacing that hunk of rust otherwise known as  brake caliper, shown at 7:19 in the video.
Thanks so very much can you please give us some more Xmas Ideas on what to get for my dad for Christmas please 🎅🏻🧑🏻‍🎄
2023 list coming soon?
The ryobi sounds like it’s rattling a lot and it just sounds somewhat cheaply made. The M18 Milwaukee sounds very well made and no detectable rattling sounds.
So happy to be able to support your channel, been viewing since hs and learned so much, will alsp be getting that book for my kiddos🥲🥲
💥💥💥
Cooper nice dog
Some mechanic on the tube is calling you out saying you scam people and tell them to buy "cheap chinese" tools...
You have a cute assistant
Me waiting for the 2023 edition 🗿
I'm excited for this years video!
Even if I didn’t have an interest in cars, I’d still love this channel. You’re an incredible presenter. Just… thank you for the great content. Sincerely.
Can we just take a second to appreciate how Chris went all out for this video ❤❤
Will you do the 2023 review? Please :)
EXCELLENT 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🦖🐍🐜🦋🕸🦎🦌🦘🦓🦭🐊🐖🥀🌜🌛🌙⭐️🌏☄️✨🌦
Show your face coward 😂
1:16 TIL that one should lift cars by the rocker panels
That children's book is so darn cute, if its still being sold by the time I have a reading kid, ill definitely buy it!  "Out with the old, and in with the new!" -Chris
Im gonna infiltrate the intake w borescope
Im sure normally you’d js get one of the nut and bolt gauges but if u ever wanted to learn u could js write it on
Cooper has been trained very good
Please release the Christmas episode before November this year to give me enough time to drop hints to my partner PLEASE :)
That Ryobi can be had for cheap on direct tools outlet, i got mine for about 35, helpful if youre buying more tools at the same time as they have flat trate shipping, but still ends up being cheaper than retail.  I have a slow leak i need to address but in the meantime it makes topping up ez.
Will there be a Christmas video for 2023?
11:10 would love to see how many times you would have to do this procedure until the collection tank gets clean water
End of summer and I end up here :D Time to think about presents ;)
WHERE IS TURBO DEL SOL!!
Is there a chrisfish channel
Wonderful Ideas!! Your videos are the best ❤
Why is everyone ignoring that you went to culinary school? Awesome video
To be honest…. I would buy even a shitty tool as long as there’s your name on it ahahahahh. This is even better, the tools are great and i tested all of them!!!!
Just got my set, thx you Cris ,,,,
2023 and you are still bringing out gifts and tools in imperial!! get with it, METRIC mm is the standard measurement the world over.
COOOPER
I wich if he posted the prices as well
awsosme   job    chris
Hi there just want to know if there is a link to download your children's book on pdf? Thank you!
Hi Chris keep on introducing quality tools. am interested on the torx lug nuts in one Would you please share the name snd where to find.
The book is too expensive
20:35 pov when I bought it Me: plays it like a butterfly knife
Very Nice Bro! Get Good People!
Don't like how his 3 piece ratchet set has 1 star review tho.
Milwaukee torque wrench
All Stores Please lower the price of all Military and Local for all brands of Tool Products and Accessories and Production Cost Now That's too much $$ The Whole World Now Pray
I like the lug torque wrench tool but is the torque accurate?
When a mechanic ask santa for something 😂😂
My name is Chris. This channel is dope
Why is your car so dirty
Thanks
heyy chris, my otherhalf really loves your videos and products so much. I was wondering if you have a merch and tool site we can order from? i would love to get him a bunch of your stuff ❤ and yes he did subscribe to your channel on both of our accounts so i hope i could get a response in return!❤ thank you so much!
Kid book?? I need that myself because I know nothing about cars  😅
if i want to make Snap On richer ill buy SnapOn.  i would rather buy Chris' set knowing it helps him grow and make more videos for us.
8:16 Cooper opening the present just to see a reverse brake bleeder  Also cooper: “Chris. What the actual f*ck. I asked for a milk bone”
I hate to think about what came to mind here 29:07
Hey bro explain this bro someone out here is calling you out on your tools your selling
Chris’s vids are so good that he uses his old vids in his new vids😂
Soapy wooder throws me off everytime
You can get that ratchet set for 20 dollars instead of 80$ scam
Bằng cách nào tôi có thể mua máy hút thảm cám ơn bạn
You had me a the book for kids. It's great to see people invested in teaching the next generation. One day I will buy this book for my kids.
I do not have hose clamp pliers I definitely need them
Gift idea: 3 jaw puller. Useful for more than just car repairs. (And the whole autozone tool rental catalog)
Sounds like you farted when going after the caliper bolt 😂😂
i will have to get the book how to change a tire for my kids they are in their 20s LOL but i actually already did teach them.
Damn I need to get that book for my little brother!  Bit late because Christmas was like 6 months ago but 🤷
How good is the Bissell water extractor, since I cant buy the Hoover in my country?
another great idea is a multimeter
You are beautiful and need to be protected
Bro, there a waitlist for your Rachets? Hahahahahahahaha WoW , thats so cool, good for you Bro.  Ill pay the deposit to wait. Woooo hoooo xmas before xmas
Dude , who is your momma and pop?  Seriously,  what breed you?  Make a cool video of your fam bro. Helmets included of course. (Or what ever represents them, to cover there face, not necessarily a helmet)  Your freaking Awesome Bro!!! Your k8d book got me
Please dont use the knife sharpener on your nice kitchen knives, use sharpening wetstones instead.
Chris do you have any videos on how to repair torn vinyl on car doors 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hey guys! could you tell me if theres any cordless extractor vacuum ? and maybe a steam cleaner running cordless on batteries? i was searching but couldn't find any
What brand was that lug torque wrench
That kids book is such a great idea. My siblings are lost when it comes to changing a tyre. My sister called out RAC for a flat when she was at work. She waited 4 hours rather than spending 10-15 minutes changing it
That coating wax is brilliant stuff. My grandpa used to take cans of it home when he was a civilian army engineer. Any metal left outside would get some of that on it. I've had a sliding lock on my shed for 10 years, no rust. The one before that was identical, rusted after 5 years to the point it was unusable cuz it didn't have the coating
please dont wish the jews happy hannukah on christmas!! thanks!
Chris can u do a video detailing how to get rid of smoke smell inside a car. Bought a car from a heavy smoker and I have cleaned it pretty well, but the smell just wont go. P.S. love the channel bro keep at it.
This man just busted his cavity nut wax inside the car and filmed it like nothing 😮
Great video. Bought the extractor vacuum and steam shot after watching. Thanks! :) Do you have a more detailed video on how to change the brake fluid with just the reverse brake bleeder? I assume you would start with the caliper furthest from the ABS unit and work your way closer? And would you need to suck fluid out of the brake fluid reservoir to stop it from over flowing/remove the old fluid being pumped up? How do you know when to stop pumping on a given caliper?
5:19 That's exactly what they are, though.  Why would anyone buy these from you when they could go to Harbor Freight, get the exact same set for way cheaper, and have a warranty on top of that?
You should make your own medium strength thread locker
Anyone know what plier set that is?
Hey Chris any tips for new and upcoming YouTubers ? Starting to take my car review channel seriously!
I can't wait to show my kids your book in 5-10 years
"Im not like that". Renamed the cheapest tool you can buy from China.
You made a book for kids wow a true here of our generation, bless you Chris you are awesome and such a positive role model! Keep it up Fam
Ok dude, what a cute and clever; thoughtful thing to do! That books will be a hit! I want to get it for my boy 😊
7
19:15 there are some better tools for knifes 😅
@chrisfix what is the sequence of this reverse brake bleeder? Which wheel do u start at?
😊
Bro really threw in his Ali Babba ratchet set and overpriced paper back book 😂
Everyone calling your ratchet set a knockoff clearly didn't watch the video and believes everything on the internet. You showed us that your set has less play and no loose parts which is enough of a reason why it's not just some garbage
When I don't wanna work on my car I turn on Chris fix and that charisma gets me hyped to do it
I'd die for Cooper
are these post international
Stop selling trash tools to people who dont know any better. Trash behavior
Lol this dude is such a crook. "Not a junky rebrand" that's exactly what it is. Dude's charging over 100 for a 20 dollar set. Generally any tool with a "special" name on it is always a rebrand.
Purchased the book for my 2 yr old girl. She has known how to say tire since she was about 11 months. She is always pointing out the tires on her wagon and our cars. She was so excited to read this book with me. She ask for me to read it again and again. Awesome book! Maybe make some more?
Stop watching this kid. He became the thing all youtubers promise not to be. Scammers.
DONT BUY HIS CRAP TOOLS. CHEAP CHINESE JUNK
Helmet boy  💀
Helmet Boys Been Called Out!
Helmet boy 😂😂
Chris some guy is calling you horse shit helmet man
Hi, I like the book idea !
Definitely lost some credibility by slapping your name on some cheap tools and overcharging for them
It’s not too late to watch the Christmas special, is it? Nick from JDTco sent me.
You're charging more for wrenches just by putting your name on things already on the market sounds like a repeat of snap-on
Reverse bleeder would be a great idea
i don't know if my dentist would approve of the cavity wax
Horseshit helmet wearing 😂
Very cool ideas ! 😅 I might give them to myself lol, i think you nailed it with the book i might get it and the ratchet set for my kid
Hey Chris which one would u recommend bissel green proheat clean or hoover spot cleaner ? And would you also able to make a video of comparison of extractor vaccum  and also provide their prices. Thank you 😊 @chrisfix
Why everyone crying for that ratchest set, its still high quality and wisely chosen.
Why are your tools just shitty chinese tools with your name on them
I love how genuine and exited Chris is about everything. I just found him today and can't wait to watch more. Keep it up Chris.
Bro you’re a legend
Great job bro. Uplifting channel
Me, who only owns a socket set: Something I don't already have in my toolbox?! No way!
Abit late to the party but that book idea is really really cool! Very good work
The book is number 1 kids are the future
Ima buy that book rn
Soapy wudder
6:40 the switch on the ratchet was on the opposite side, silly Chris.
ok chris, the whole book idea just won me over, I subbed and bought your book
Chris, where can I get that digital tire deflator that you used?
I love your elf cooper
I’ll like to buy and own all the products you have
Duuuude i never seen a dog get excited to open a Christmas present ❤
You are cool.
For the lug wrench I just kinda thought that I don’t really care about the factory specs I just use the ugga dugga gun
We don’t deserve this man he’s too good for us
Put a drill with your name on it
Chris fix one of these days do you think you can make a book on how to change the oil
Yes finally my favorite youtuber for 3 years is backkk!
Thank you
Love from Karachi Pakistan Your video's are very helpful to me Nice work keep it up 👍👍👍👍👍
I know you feel you have to say car girls but please don’t go woke on us Chris. What is the real percentage of females that actually work on cars? Maybe 1 percent of the entire population?
16:30 wait a minute. What kinda Christmas/YouTube magic was that!? A 30" gift wrapped package 🎁 just came out of a 12" stocking.... something ain't right. I wanna see Santa🎅, Mrs Clauss 🤶, and Rudolph in my office before lunch today.   ... gonna get to the bottom of THIS!
Santa with protective  gloves :-)
Such a sad day that my phone's built in security system physically won't let me open the link for the extendable ratchet because it is "potentially harmful"
honey, that dude in the next house is dressed as Santa again!!
We get happy with just a hot wheels 🤐
Chris is the best...learned so much from this guy
I don’t hate Chris but I gotta say this , the other extendable ratchet looks very old but Chris’s ratchet are new (I’m just pointing it out)
ive never heard "  the proof is in the pudding" but i like it
29:07 Bro nutted in his car
Went to order the extendable ratchets...out of stock 😢
Hey Chris could I get your opinion on something , my car yesterday was going a little over the halfway mark on my engine cooling system when I’d drive over 60mph , than earlier today I turned my car on drove off and my engine turned off and my steering wheel locked , engine wasn’t over heated tho , I have oil I just put sum ; what could be the issue
When is the new video coming out i need a new video 😢😢😢😢
The video styles are still the exact same as they were when I watched on my big brothers account 6 years ago
Love the content your my favorite YouTuber love from Norway 🇳🇴
Can you please do a video of a 2002 Toyota Corolla starter change I need to change mine but it's hard to kno how to take mine out
Sir can you make a video how to remove and replace lash adjusters/lifters without removing timing cover and timing chain for i20 1.2 p 2011?
I love u Man
Chris fix got lazy it’s been 3 months 😢
New content when?
brother i love your videos they helped me more than once, it's a pity that they are so rare :(
CHRISFIX IS THE BEST YOUTUBE CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE, POINT-BLANK-PERIODT  Seriously though, thanks for the awesome vids, Chris. You inspire lots of people to work on their own cars and I think that's awesome. 😎
yo chris when are you going to post a video again?
He still hasn’t posted the video that he promised us 💀
its been a year daddy
I know you said your book is for, “For 8-10 year olds”. But can I give it to my doctoral candidate 27 year old daughter? Despite all my time in the garage, apparently I failed to pass on certain life skills….
Hey Chris, What Day you going to Fix your Red Mustang GT put  Super Charger motor
Thats a good dog
14:42
He said new vid yesterday!!!  Damnnnn dudeeeeee
Only issue with the knife sharpener near the end is some. knives have a "Secondary" bevel which is primarily seen in Utility and hunting knives, Like boker or Cold steel, and for good reason so try not to use those sort of knives on that sharpener otherwise great video, Keep up the great work mate.
When the new vid coming ??😅
You almost at 10 million, YouTube will be here soon
When you hit 10 million can you do a face review
Along with that book, I'd like to see a "what to do in case of an accident" and a basic maintenance one too.   I learned as a kid but most people I know in real life know squat about the cars they drive every day. I know a smart adult man who has no idea what his mileage is, not even ballpark. I know another smart adult woman who drives a '20 or '21 wrx and won't go out when her tire pressure warning light is on, because she doesn't know how to fill or check psi, so you know, when it's cold out hahah  It doesn't occur to non car people
when youre gonna put the turbo kit on the del sol
Hey @chrisfix how do u get an airbag light off an bmw e36

Hello mr chrisfix supporter here😊 can make a video about toyota corolla 2e engine about the idle cause when I turn on the ac the idle goes low but when I turn it off the idle goes High.  I hope you'll notice 😊♥️
Hey Chris I have a question 🙋🏾‍♂️ whenever I park my car it smells like gas sometimes also sometimes when I’m driving it does do you know what that could be? Also sorry but another question when I’m driving sometimes my car turns off and I have to park it and turn the key again do you have any idea what that is??
Guys am late  Is is still Christmas still

Hey Chris, can you give me some pointers I have Toyota AE86, and i wanna turn it into a street racer. What are some tips you can give me?
H2 Hummer update, exhaust wont be in for another month, will get it installed then. Fixed battery issue, think the Hummer wouldn’t start because terminal connection, i cleaned up the terminal. Its nice and snug now. Also found the draw on battery removed the one fuse. Its .056ma now. Pretty sure there is a loose cord to the rear dvd that is causing the .045 on the radio fuse. H2 been killer driving, if you live on east coast I would do a Hummer run with you. Let me know cheers
REPENT AND FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST BEFORE ITS TOO LATE 🔴.

[21] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also..

Where are you Chris
hey Chris, new guy here I'm currently working on buying tools for my car. I just bought new bc coilovers. I was wondering if you could possibly do a vid on basic tips and stuff with changing parts out, for example you use thread lock a decent bit but idk much about it other than there's red and blue. idk I feel like I sound ignorant again new guy, jus sum light tips i did watch your tools vid i struggled a little bit but it did help in finding out what I need basically but like idk if I should be looking for 1/2 in drive or 3/4 inch I understand its jus a difference in size but does it matter again I'm sorry if I just am not paying enough attention
So whens the supercharged driftstang video coming
chris can you do a video on an engine swap 😅 Love the content man keep it up
Good video

Your so close to 10m ❤🎉
How do you fix teslas
More videos...  You have such a large subscriber base, yet content creation has been slow.   Stop letting your base down!
Hello Chris, i read that you read people's comments for up to 4 hours a day so i was hoping you'd read mine. I recently bought a citroen c4 and a huge flaw with the design is that the rubber below the front windshield glass detaches and lets water fall into the engine bay. Do you have any advice on how to fill in that gap? The rubber part is deformed and it's impossible to find a replacement part. I'm a huge fan and you're one of the reasons i started loving cars for which i'll always be thankful.
I just read a comment from you where you said you take almost 4 hours everyday to read and respond to comments... Thank you for being such a dedicated person, and thank you for so much saved money by DIYing, truly a people's person
Chris pls make some videos I was waiting for a long time
can you fix a ram 1500
I wish we had more repair videos from Chrisfix..

Hey Chris when will you resume your project driftstang start?Ive haven’t seen those videos in a while.
Hey Chris, I just saw your first podcast and was amazed on how you put so much time and effort into your research, outline, and provide examples for the videos. Especially, giving us the courage to follow our passion and to take or seek any opportunity that comes our way!!!
That tire inflator would’ve saved me so much time I’m a delivery driver and so many people trash their driveways I plug my tires on shift and stop at a gas station to add air but it gets risky finding one fast

Hey Chris my 2003 mustang gt radiator drain plug broke because it’s plastic and I tightened it to much and it’s apart of the radiator so I can’t just get a new plug I’d have to get a new radiator and I can’t afford that. Do you think I can plastic weld it close shut permanently until I get a new radiator?
Post video plz
Please make a video on “how to check rebuild vehicle before buying” please😬😬🙂🙂

Chris fix they saw your face when you where with saabkyle04
Love everything you do man, I've always wondered how you learned everything you know about cars, just started looking into cars myself and your vids help alot!
HEY BROTHER CHECK INSTAGRAM!!!! MADE YOU A BANNER HOPE YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO!!!!
This has nothing to do with the video but I’ve been learning to start a 36 year old Toyota ae86 and there’s so much I don’t know. I know what parts to get but don’t know what they all do or how I should go about it. Really hoping you could give some advice or some help. Thank you for all the helpful videos. I got the spark to finally fix the 86 because you made the process of starting a sitting car sound a lot more simple than my brain was letting me think
Hi,we have car jump starters for Youtube sponsored video, paid cooperation, pls reply, thank you.
The devil shivers everytime he hears "Hey guys, ChrisFix here!".

Hey Chris, question, when do you think you will fit a supercharger into your DriftStang? I'm wondering if anything happened to it or you scrapped the idea since it's been quite a while now. No rush though your videos are already as enjoyable as is :D
Great gift Ideas!
Beautifully done.  Thanks for the tips. 👍
When is the next vid coming?
Hello! Will there be a video i february? :)
٢٠٢٣🎉
هههههههههههههه😂
I have the M12 Inflator and it's quite good. I went 2 months of daily inflating a tire. Toward the end of that 2nd month it became a twice daily inflate. The 2ah battery is enough to fill that 1 tire once (the tire was down to 7psi at some points), with some charge left over. it's a good inflator for topping off 4 tires.
“Book is for 8-10 year olds”… *people over 22 reading the book*😂😂
Im sorry but that book is more for like 6 year olds and under.
Hey guys ChrisFix here and today I'm gonna show you how to change the colour of the sun from yellow to blue.
Can u make a rubber cushion suspension review video before and after plz
Excellent ideas! I wonder if you or anyone knows how long the Cavity Wax is purported to last?
Chris you should do a series of buying your first sport motorcycle, working on it and taking it to the track. Just a new idea and would love to see you use it.
Chrisfix I need help changing sun valve lifters but I can’t find a good video that explains well is there any way you could help me?

Hi guys i need some help.While driving i hear clicking noise and its coming from rear/middle of car. Noise is constant, it gets faster with  higher speed. Car: peugeot  206 2.0 hdi.
Mr fix... I tried doing the paint correction wet sanding. Bout gave myself a panic attack 😑 the first couple steps make the paint look sooooooo bad. It's not perfect but I managed to get it pretty good. The main goal was to fix a couple little spots where I tried a paint pen for the first time. My next car wash I'm going to try again to fix the micro scratches and really get the paint looking clean.
W mans

Hey Chris so my friends dad gave him his 2005 mustang that's been sitting for two years and it has a new battery and I tested the alternator for power and it has power but when I try to start it the engine doesn't turn over and doesn't do anything other than the lights come on what should I do because I have no idea what to do next

What ever happened to the Del Sol project?
Am from Kenya and I love to watch your videos
Hi Chris, how can one get to buy one of your extendable ratchet sets outside the US? Thanks
I love this series
Came here after seeing your story about that bad review… I agree that you should make more videos. You’re one of the only good diy YouTubers out there and there’s a lot more to learn. The way you put detail into your instructions really makes is seem so simple compared to the thousands of diy repair videos. However what he said about the book is messed up. Your intentions are good and that was a very clever way to educate the younger people out there. But again the videos man we all miss them. For some reason all of my favorite YouTubers are bad at posting new content (Cory).
Wait until they find out that the flare nut wrench set is $180 💀
I agree, i had to replace my mastercilinder on my 1979 Isuzu KB and i had to make my own flarenut wrench by cutting a slit into the box end of an 10 mm wrench just to get it loose without stripping it. I definitifly agree 100% that it is a good idea to have a set like this, thanks for all your helpful videos.
Could u do a video in oil pumps?
Can you do more drift videos? pls
Still waiting for that drum to caliper conversion video
Hey Chris!  I saw a picture of an old Ford falcon that had leaf springs that were mounted under the axle rather than on top.  I researched a little, and I was wondering if you ever dealt with this type of leaf spring, and if you ever work on old, classic cars.  Thanks!
Chris is the man. 💪
When are you making another video😇
Been waiting for the turbo honda video man
Can u make more videos
what hapend to the drift stang
Chrisfix please give a garage tour
Hey @ChrisFix - Any bright ideas on how to buff out some surface scratches across the side of my car...but in the dead of winter with no access to a garage? We're talking -10-20C temperatures around here. I'd obviously aim for a milder day since I'm not too keen on freezing my uhh..."lug nuts" off any more than I have to but I'm still stuck with the cold for at least another two months.  And shoutout to whoever decided to slam their grocery cart against my car without so much as leaving a note since you're the MAP - "Most Awful Person".
You should face reveal at 10mil
Can you put turbo on the mustang
I want to know about the drift stang plz post about it
No more new videos?
Please do more videos of the driftstang
What about the bur on the knife
Great video!! You should do a video where you replace the ignition components in a car! I’m about to do the ignition in my moms car because when she turns the key it gets stuck and doesn’t always let her get the key turned all the way. You’re the best Chris, I’m buying your book!
Chris, how do I fix my driving and my rear end accident? lol
Please write a book about how to do oil change 4Runner and Honda van and how to super clean the interior.
Please start doing car flipping it would be so good
Hey Tmartn.

I think you should repair a car using tools from wish/ Ali express and rating them
Hello ChrisFix, I disconnected my negative battery terminal and when I reconnected it, my steering power telescope does not push the steering full length in and out direction but works perfect in up/down position. When I let the car rest for awhile the telescope moves longer distance both in and out and as I continue to play around with the telescope knob, the distance gets smaller and smaller till it stops to move the steering completely in the in/out position. Even when it stops to move the steering in/out direction i can still hear the knob button clicking sound. What might be the issue please? This is the first time it has happened, Toyota Crown Athlete 2012 GRS200, no issue with up/down movement
What is the full name of the camera
Hey Chris! No more videos for you until you upload the status of the DriftStang! I miss it.🥺Plssss
Update of the lemons btw est. the endurance race pls.
Hello Chris pls I saw a used 335i 2008 with less than 120k miles. Pls what do you advice I check while inspecting the car . I’m going for the inspection soon
How can I get a signed book? I will buy the book and pay for shipping.
My favorite gadget is my new pressure washer and mjjc pro 2.0 foam cannon. That thing is soooo much fun to use. I've never had so much fun washing a car before. I can't wait till it gets dirty so I can do it again 🤣
car/ windshield heater please :D
The first time you see the same thing
Got dang I want to ratchet some flare nuts now. This guy isn’t a salesman. He just literally shows 99% of the world how to do things the right way and the practical application. There’s other channels like this where they show you how to do car stuff but they have 50k in tools. Someone who talks in this tone and doesn’t show his face(to me anyways) shows you he is happy and feels good doing this and doesn’t want to be famous. Maybe you could Google his face. Whatever. You can find anyone these days. I know basic basic knowledge about cars and repairs  but experienced in detailing. Nonetheless, I learn something in every video I watch and him doing it with his tone of voice and awareness really makes me more comfortable trying new things on my car. This is what YouTube is about. The people who do their thing and care. No crypto “ChrisFixCoins”.. no “Buy 2.5 sq ft of land in Ireland and be a king”.. just literally information presented in a welcoming tone. I’ll watch this channel and have to hold back my new found confidence 😂 I’m out here trying to tell people to bleed their brakes and how to leave enzomatthermoshield on the inside of the tires when they clean them but protect them from o zone & dry rot by applying a protective gel. Chris is the man. I’d hurt if he ever quit. Chris, we love you dog. Please never stop
Hey chris love your videos, i have a question over my truck. It won’t turn on unless i have a source of charge on the battery but then it’ll start right up. Once i get back from the drive or turn it on it won’t start up. I had put a new alternator and battery recently. What do you think it is?
Bro we're is the how to install turbo video
@ChrisFix the ratchest are perfect👌 i bought one set for my dad
me being 15 not having a car watched who watched the whole video:😲😮
Chris where do you advertise to repair cars?  I have a 2008 ford expedition el with multiple issues I’ve attempted based on your videos but could use some help. Youtube has many videos about same topic with all different fixes… hmmm already 1k in.   You could use it for many different videos
Nice Yokohama MT  I have run these for years.

Petition to bring back the drift stang ❤
I don’t know but whenever I see Chris fix video he makes my day
I wish i was the neighbour, and see this out my window like "Tf is my man Chris doin'?"
I am sorry to whoever may read this, but Chrisfix fixes cars so good, he won't have anything to fix.
Make a "How to change your Brakes" Book. with the amount of vids you made covering this I think it'd be a great fit
Chrisfix, I am trying to fix up a 1995 firebird, the issue with it is that it has a leaking rear main seal, my question is there any video you’d recommend for this tutorial, or could you possibly do a tutorial on this? I know it’s a bit of a more complicated fix, but if you have any advice I’d love some. I’m not mechanically inclined but I really want this car to come back to life. Thanks for all you do, I’ve been watching your videos for a couple years now and you’re a huge help to me and my friends and family 💕
2023
good selection!🎉
I wish Chris would make videos like every day or atleast every week
Hey I’ve got a 1998 Land Rover Discovery that’s got a blown head gasket, but it wants to overheat immediately after it gets up to temperature, will any of these bottles still work? I read you have to run the vehicle for 60 minutes on the one I bought, that’s too much time I think.

Crowfoots are extremely helpful especially for removing drive shaft bolts that you can’t fit sockets on and there is barely any room to swing a wrench
Idk if you were stuck as a lube tech for a while but I was wondering after I put my time in how do i prepare to become a big dog like you? I already have a senior master technician taking me under their wing. I feel like I’m ready but how do I prepare how do I make sure I have the knowledge so I don’t mess anything up?
Hey Chris! So my trucks computer is going crazy so I have to get a new one, any chance you could make a video on replacing the ECM? I love your videos and can’t find any useful ones anywhere, I also can’t afford a mechanic
Almost to ten million subscribers 👏 Let's help him get to ten million  before June!
Hi Chris, Do you think it is safe to use a reverse bleeder in car with ABS? A friend warned me not to buy it, it will push all the old fluid into the ABS cube which can damage it! I make on Europian cars. Thanks for the reply I'm thinking of buying! 🤝🙂
0:21 "theres stuff here that you dont already have in your toolbox" *well  thats because i dont have a  toolbox*  lol
Chris are you OK? You haven't posted anything for a while

Thanks for making home car repair less intimidating and more accessible. ❤

The Waffle House has found its new host.
Hey chrisfix I seen your post on the honda del sol and currently am facing a similar problem. My 1999 honda civics interior has mold and a lot of water puddled in the carpet and I was hoping to be able to clean it without replacing it. Any tips or could we get a video on cleaning the del sol? @chrisfix hello?

Hey chris! Just wondering, do you have any interest on make video about repairing/fixing motorcycle??
Would love to see him build a classic car or truck
Ok, I found this channel by accident... I don't think I'd try most of these all by myself, but Chris' energy makes this a few seasons of happy series :) Appreciate it :)
How come the video frequency has dropped so much on this channel? With that many subscribers, I can't help thinking that it's a wasted opportunity not to upload at least once a week.
we want u in more races
Love your reviews videos
Hi Chris .. can you make a video explaining how to clean a car air conditioner evaporator? please
Love all the tools!!!
Brother can you show how to install aftermarket headers at home
I dunno if you'll ever see this. But I'm buying my first car today. I'm 19, and I've been watching your videos for years. I have the used car checklist printed off and ready to go, and if all goes well:  This $2,750 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis LS will be mine.  Thank you for almost a decade of helping car people, old and new alike, for learning so much about how to fix and maintain their vehicles on decent budgets.  How can I pay that gratitude back?
I've been fan of your channel since late 2014.  Also Chris, I have a question.  My dad's 97 Mercedes S420L (W140) (4.2L V8), that when we opened the coolant reservoir cap, The coolant look like light chocolate or milkshake looking. In fact my dad says he did replace the coolant several hours ago. I'm currently waiting your answer for any clues or symptoms? Thanks.
I put muddy water on my carpets... they're dirty
Those ratchets need to have a locking flex head edition  As for the multi tool, you really need to test the Goat multi tool. Let me know how do you like on IG
Chris the goat an for the kids🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
I haven’t watched this yet I just wanted to say I’m so excited to see what these are and I hope I find something that I’ll like so I can go out and get one myself thank you for this video!!
Hey Chris i have a problem with my car. Im 15 years old guy today i bought my first multimetar and i asked my dad if i can check battery and alternator he said yes so i checked after 1 hour he came said that both rear dors wont open he said that i 100% made short circuit and thats why it wont open so im asking you did i make short circuit and do you know how cen i open dors. Sorry if i have made some mistakes in writting bc i am from Serbia. Its Fiat Stilo 1.6 petrol gas
Sad to see downfall of this channel. It was about cool and easy repairs but now it's meaningless and unrelated car videos.
These are some great tools I like them all. But the one to clean your Car’s looks amazing👀❤️
Hey Guys Chris Miss Here
MerryChristmas Chris.   Im putting a digital tachometer ( dash)  how can i run the wires  in what location 1967 firebird
Hi ! Chris, Can you make a video on how to install a breaks pad in a electrical emergency brake , like 2020Toyota Rav4.
As a 14 year old kid I have been trying to learn about cars and the tools I need for the job and so far ChrisFix is the best car YouTuber
Are the Chris Fix ratchets made in the USA? If not, why not?
hey chris plzz do a video on rebuilding totalled cal plzz chris.
My favorite intro was drift-decorating the Christmas tree with the Driftstang
Great video. Each gadgets use nicely demonstrated and explained. Well done.
I love watching your videos when I have time I watch your videos 🙂☺️
Hey Chris, its been 2 years, what happened to the driftstang?
i missed the driftstang
Chris, is there a way to clean the rust screws and bolts in the engine? Right now I'm seeing my Honda civic 2006 battery has rusty screws and the negative (ground) has green rust (dust). I'm wonder if these can be cleaned or if I have to replace my car battery and the engine screws/bolts as well.
Hey Chris love your videos brother. But is there a reason you don’t show yourself to your followers just wondering piece.
Petition for Chris to say "Hey guys! Christopher Fixtopher here," in the next video
I do not recommend the Bissell little green extractor vacuum. It doesn’t work well. Get a little more expensive one. You will appreciate it more.
Do you sell tools in millimetre sizes instead of inch sizes
I was headed to the comments to say those look like rebranded harbor freight extendable rachets.  Then you displayed how little play there was.  Thank you for not rebranding bad tools.
R.I.P Chris...
ive seen the extractor vaccume ill get it. can u do a detailed vidoe on leather seats like with a steamer to do it fast really good and safe please and thank you i havent seen a video about leather seats
Wow everything on here was useful. I’m going to get all of it if is still available
You are awesome bro
Hi chris I really appreciate your hard working man and could you help me with any theory book that's could help me to be a good mechanic like you man...
How about a extendible extension bar set for 3 drive sizes?

Happy for Chris
About a year and a half ago I asked when you would do a turbo kit install video and you said at 10 million subs. We’re almost there and I hope you keep your word.
Chris this is totally off topic but I have a question about reverse camera that is standard from factory. Mine is a 17 plate focus and it has what looks to be condensation on the left n right side but the middle is clear . Is this something that's easy to fix ? I think it's something that can't be helped but it's annoying , I'm in UK btw .
Hi Chris i wana make you my mentor for starting my own youtube channel and i need your help pliz
Can you use the reverse bleeder for bleeding a clutch 🧐
It’s a rebranded Pittsburg extending ratchet set. Let’s not pretend.
Hey Chris! I hope your doing well man, I wanted to ask what part of Nj you are in because I need some help with my car but no mechanic is able to tell me exactly what problem I have, I have some general knowledge but I’d like to know more as I love cars, I’m actually studying to become an engineer, but I need help with this problem as it’s been bothering me for months, let me know if we can work something out cause I wanna fix the problem without a mechanic giving me more if not charging me more money for stuff I don’t need
Where is the DriftStang ?
Give us gift maan 🤣 joke ✌️ full support from Philippines.

Could you do a video or a short on how to bleed the coolant system on the e46?
Hey Chis! I watched this channel a lot when you still did drifting, can you bring the driftstang back and make a video with some drifting? just wondering, you don't have to.
no way you did an book, its awesome! i like the idea of a simple but fun quick guide on how to swap out an flat tire, its also kinda collectible so yeah, absolutely amazing!
Wow! How many book did you sell?
Chrisfix where is another lemon race
When there is gonna be a drift project again like the mustang make it pls
Great list! Defnitely saved some of these for next christmas! How about a list that includes some stuff for older people that work on their cars (like creepers, stools, etc).
I use a Michelin manual foot pump to inflate my tyres, is accurate, silent and lasted me for years and still have it and still works . It didn't cost much either and you don't have to worry about the batteries
Hey Chris, huge fan here. I was wondering what you suggest I do. My 2016 sonata se spark plug coil bolt keeps spinning. Any suggestions on how to take it off?
Santa opening his one gifts, and showing how awesome they are 😂
Dear Mr.Fix,  I'm writing to you in hopes that you have some knowledge pertaining to and issue I've been battling with my 2003 Ford Ranger 3.0. I've followed you for quite some time, and used many of your videos as a guide to flawless repairs, modifications.. For example; proper detailing, disc and drum brakes, suspension, kill switch, bed lighting, and many more. Now to the point: Several months ago my heater/AC quit working, zero air whatsoever. I chose the wrong path and replaced the Blower Motor, and the Blower Motor Resistor, nothing. Later a nice gentleman at the grocery store informed me that my Reverse Lights were not functioning. Time passes, I finally have some time to start looking into it.. I discover that Fuse #2 is blown. ((Daytime Running Lights (DRL), Back-up Lamps, Transmission, Passenger Air Bag Deactivation Switch, Blower Motor Relay)). I replace the Fuse while sitting in the O'reily parking lot and bam, I've got AC and Heat, all levels blowing perfect. Then the second I go to put it in gear, I cross Reverse, and the fuse blows. I came home to research more and found a bunch of complaints about this exact situation, the majority solution seemed to be the OVERDRIVE/on/off button having chaffed wires. I took the dash apart, checked the wire, didn't notice anything bad, so I followed the wire to it's connector and disconnected it from the larger wiring harness. I popped in a new fuse, and again, the second the shifter hit reverse, the fuse blew. All other fuses are fine, any added electronics are on their own separate fused lines.  Other things that have been occurring; I switched the dash lights out for LEDS when a couple were going bad, instantly some of those began failing, the remaining ones flicker a lot unless I turn the dimmer to absolute low (this includes the interior dome light, half the time it doesn't work unless you punch it). The last code I've received off my OBDII was B1318. I'm out on my wits right now, I suppose tomorrow I'll go ahead and start checking with the reverse wires and under the truck.  Long shot, but what do you think? ever encountered anything like that with your Mazda?? -Thank you so much for all you've done to help the common car owner save so much money. You are much appreciated.
What size wheels and tires do you run on your b3000 I have a ranger just like that and I love the look of yours. Thanks Chris love your videos and keep up the good work!
Chris fix, with Christmas fix for us,always on time.
Support comment from Thailand.
Hey Chris. On my 97 cobra I went to take the key out of the door and the whole lock cylinder came out with it . A piece also fell inside the door. What should I do?
Hay Chris can you help me fix my moms car, It would help a lot if you would talk a look at some pictures sometime soon and give me some feed back???
Anyone know of a good dent puller? I've got a pretty decent sized ding in a truck I bought, it's about 3-4 inches wide and 2-3 inches tall. Pretty big dent, was wondering the easiest way to get it out
Chrisfix can u plz give me advice my mom's Nissan 4 door car engine won't turn on what can cause the issue? Is it fixable do u have a repair shop near California?
When is the next vid
You're killing me chris. Will you stock up on the ratchet set?
Can u show us how to replace speakers in doors nd trunk idk what I’m doin nd ppl don’t really cover the steps like u be doin it
Kudos for the book brochacho. 👍🏽
Great Video! Love these annual gift idea videos! Can't afford it now, but when I can def gonna get a set of the ChrisFix Extendable Ratchet Set!!! SUGGESTION:      hey Chris as for the books, great idea, I just want to suggest that for next books maybe do car battery check and change. Since everything is going electric now, when kids grow up they might be living in a world that is mostly EVs, so the books makes more sense to head towards that direction.
Hey man I'm glad I found your channel cos it's all I need at the moment  Can yuh please make a video on how to identify a converted steering wheel?
Hey Chris! Probably a fat chance you'll respond, but I'm wondering if you have recommendations for light surface rust on the body frame of a car. How much is too much? How do I repair it? Should I not worry about it if it's just surface level? Maybe it would be a good video!
we need a drift stang vidio its benn 2 years
i am a fan of Chrisfix's videos because i am an mechanical engineer when i grow up because i am still a kid and this is my grandma's account on a tablet
I'm your Day fan for 7 years
Chris I think you should twin turbo the driftstang
Chrisfix I want to let you know if you actually hit 10 million subs you get the diamond play button.
Usually these kind of "gift ideas" videos from other creators suck but there's so much stuff here that I would be very happy to get
I know you just uploaded but when will more driftstang videos be coming out, im really looking foward to it
Thank you for doing this video my dad changed his cars spark plug because you did this and gave us this wonderful video
Chris fix I have a truck does 2h still use a transfer case or is the transfer case just for fwd part of it
PLEASE READ MY COMMENT show us how to super clean headlights cause my headlights are expensive to replace. i love you so much for saving me money just by cleaning myself cause i bought new lights and i still have trouble seeing on the road and that’s important bro please respond
I'll love to tryout the extractor head for cleaniing my seats and rugs in my cars and trucks.
Are those extendable ratchets going to be around again? Tried to get some and Amazon said they are not in stock and no ETA.
Where do you get the lug pork ranch it's awesome
Congrats on the book Chris!!
Still waiting for the driftstang to make a comback
cooper a good boy
Dang extendable ratchets are sold out already
Chris please I need the turbo install. 😭 I’ve had 3 children and 6 divorces in the time I’ve been waiting for this video
Dam you Chriisfix always giving me project ideas. 😅😂❤
Chris got me wanting to get these christmas gifts for myself
Cavity Wax... New term. I like it
Chris can you please make a home made trailer pls.
That was such a great video & some of these items are definitely awesome. Will look to get them soon. Please make a video about WD40, Silicon Sprays & Grease uses as they are very confusing to me. Like someone says that I should use Grease on car instead of wd 40 & others says silicon sprays are better deal. It'll be so nice if an expert like you can guide us to use these items properly otherwise they'll do more harm than good.
I hope he sells a million copies tbh
when will you do more vids of the drifstand ;[
Pretty great products ! I love it all .
happy  Hanukkah
Chris when will you do the video where you instal the supercharger to the driftstang?
"Turbo del sol coming soon!" 13 year old me was so excited to see it happen.... almost 4 years later I got my own del sol B series thinking I'm gonna turbo before Chris does 😂
Boss! How can I prevent the dash of  my lexus from being sticky? Please HELP.
hey chrisfix what'd you do with the exhaust with cutouts that you showed us in the rain drifting video
God i love this channel
Man i just wana buy all of these for myself ✨
Hey, you most likely won't see this but your channel is definitely one of my favorite channels I've come across when learning about cars. Just really fun stuff!
I really like that lug torque wrench, looks awesome
This is by far the best tool gift idea video on YouTube. Most videos have junk almost all the stuff on here I would love to have lol.
or it could help me with my oil filter on mt 1997 4runner
does the reverse brake bleeder also work on bikes, im assuming it does?
Okay but where is the turbo kit video?
My 2009 Honda Accord Stalled 5 years ago After I Drove Through High Waters But After A Few Tries It Started Again But With The Engine Light 5 Years Ago And Was Told The Catalytic Converter Is Bad, That’s The Code That Comes Up. As I’m Driving Sometimes Exhaust Smells Permeate The Interior Which Smell Like Rotten Eggs. Also Somehow I’ve Managed To Pass DMV Inspection 4 Years Straight With A Check Engine Light & Bad Catalytic Converter.  What’s crazy is that this year I failed the DMV EMISSION TEST 4x and then I went to a shop and asked them to clear the codes and prayed and when they checked again at the DMV it passed 😂. This year they were strict but prior years they weren’t even checking! The dealership says I have Low Compression On The Number 4 Cylinder & P0420 & P0304. They say the engine was at 60psi. They performed the diagnostic in July.  I heard Cataclean cleans the catalytic converter. I saw it on Amazon. What do you think? Is That Bad Catalytic Converter Endangering My Life?
Where is the driftstang
No video about wheel alignment 😢…I’ve been waiting for this…hope to see it in near future
That brake bleeder is probably the best thing ever featured on this segment. I’ll have to get one😅
I. am. A.  Big. Fan
I  have a  shap  por
Hello chrisfix, one question, what happened to the driftstang? Did I miss something?
you are the reasons i love cars, even though i dont have one. Thanks for your help and it feels good to see you succeed.
Next video how to remove a check engine light (Car)
Culinary school? So hmm ChrisFix ChrisFish is there a ChrisFood I don’t know about. He can fix your car, Catch dinner and cook it
Please tell me I still get those ratchet tools I need them
Question. Wat would cause my bmw 325ci not going into gear manual 5 speed 2001. I've read check fluids if that doesn't work bleed to clutch then just replace the whole clutch
love cooper :)
this man is a national treasure, protect him at all cost
next episode idea: garage make over
I had ordered your book for my nephew originally but he's only 2 years old so I gave it to my niece instead. She's an 8 year old tomboy,and has the coolest uncle who can't wait to turn wrenches with her when she gets a 4 wheeler or scooter.  Her dad is hopeless around anything with an engine, at least now she can change a tire so he doesn't call a road service 😂
I love your videos and always feel like I need more and more. Something caught my eye. At 6:40 when you use a rachet to loose the lug nuts, you had the rachet set to tighten them. I don't know if it was intentional or not.
God bless you brother
I waited whole year to see video
How do you fix an oil leak?
Can you possibly help me eith something by replying to this comment?. My car window keeps going off track, the first time it did I tried fixing it but I couldn't get the window out because it had fallen all the way down to the bottom of the door, my sisters friend ended up helping and getting it out, but I'm not sure how. The second time this happened, which was today, the car window didn't fall all the way down so I was able to grab the window and get it out and fix it from there. But what I'm wondering is how can I get the window out of the door if it falls to the bottom again? And also how can I stop this from happening. My car is a 2003 Vw golf. I don't know much about cars but have always been interested in them and have been slowly starting to learn how to work on them.
Hey , i am looking for a perfect additive for fueling my car . What do you recommend that don’t make any problem with my car
when are you going to put a supercharger on the Mustang, I'm waiting for that video. And good job Chris
Thank you for using Christmas in your title. Many of us appreciate it. Merry Christmas

Top notch editing and clear speech. This is how professionals make entertaining  YT videos!!!
To bad the flare nut ratchet only comes with ft pounds. We use metric Nm in the Netherlands
I want to make a car but I don’t know what tools I can use
Amazing Video! Always look forward for this every Xmas. Can you do a Top 5 Christmas Gift ideas fan’s edition?
Awesome I need most of those!!
Is the Mustang okay?
Perfect. I’ve been wanting to check my wife’s car brakes. Bought it THANK YOU FROM ALASKA!!!
Chris Fix has joined Harbor Freight to offer you the best tools China can fabricate and unlike Snap-on you will not be getting a lifetime warranty!
Wow  I   love  it😍
These are actually good products... Great video
From Toronto, very useful YouTube man.
Is there any tools to fix a broken marriage?
Merry Christmas Chris!!! Thank you for your years of dedication in helping and sharing. Congratulations on your new book. May you sell tens of thousands at a bare minimum. I look forward to the end of the year recommendations because it's where I get gadgets for friends, family and myself.   May GOD continue to Bless you abundantly.
I need new tools, so I definitely need them!
Love the book idea.
Socket wrenches are not available... bummer.
Dude you're awesome as hell with these videos
How much are you asking on those ratchets? I'm trying to buy some but can't at the moment because of stock issues it says, but I'm definitely going to buy some
is that a engine in the back?
Next on the @projectFarm Channel: ¿Which extensible rachet is best? !Lets Find out! Including @Chisfix 's extensible rachet set...
I'm buying all Chris fixes stuff
I'm in Belize,merry Xmas chrisfix .from Belize central America.
hi
December 2022, 9.31 Million Subscribers! Really good at working on stuff. Goal: December 2023, 15 Million Subscribers! Contain the current amount of amazing skill that Chris already has.❤
Any idea if the ratchets will be available again? I left them in my cart for a (ahem) Christmas gift and somebody didn't get the hint, so I lost out on them.
I love Christmas
Great kid with huge talent and a big heart. Merry Christmas Chris, awesome work!
Chris! How your Driftstang project is going?
Hey Chris! Just have a doubt. I have bought a car wax from 3M, like 5 years back. I haven't opened it yet still. Does the car wax stay good for long? or should I dispose it?
It's awesome that you have your own merchandise. I've been following you for years since your first "how to" video on brakes, and I learned a lot about vehicles.
Thanks Chris, now instead of having a cart of $500 now it’s around $800 because I found yours and more tools I need 💀
I really liked the reverse brake bleeder! 👍🏾👍🏾
Nice video Chris, I'm from Jamaica and really love working on my own car's.. thanks for tools info
Merry Christmas! 🎄🎅☃️ I wanted to spend my Amazon gift card on your rachet set! None in stock 😭... When will there be a restock? Thanks for the great tool ideas! Love tool gadgetry 😁
Get a supra and get a 2jz
Where is the mustang Chris
Great video Chris, keep it up 👍
I just got my extendable ratchet set for Christmas and I absolutely love them!! The quality of them is outstanding however my only complaint is the play in my ratchet’s. I don’t know if I just got a bad batch but it’s a little more play then I was expecting. All in all though they are still fantastic and I can’t wait to use them!!
Merry Christmas 🎄
I kinda wish this was dropped in November so I could have taken note on some of these…. Especially the extended ratchet set
Merry ChrisFix everyone
My multi tool is the most handy and used item I own! I don’t understand how people survive without them lol. MERRY CHRISTMAS CHRIS!
About the tire deflaiting things, in my new car i got one inside the car, is this the same or ?
There unique, No my frend, you`re unique <3 merry cristmas buddy
Even im not christian and i like for the tools
You're the reason I started my channel. I love the book idea. You're awesome
Never knew a Hummer was a "car"
I read your children's book to my 5 yr old the other day. I told him the next time I read it to him, we're going to read it step by step outside with my car so he can actually see how to change a tire.  Thank you so much for all you do and happy holidays
Great video as always! Merry Christmas
merry christmas chrisfix
Happy HanukKAMEHAMEHA!!!!!!!!
Yo chris i think ya should show us how to make a car higher or lower if u can
I got my father the oil udder this year because we changed the oil on our mini van and was mad because of the placement of the filter and how it always makes a mess😁 can't wait for Christmas to give it to him
Can this get posted sooner in December next year? That way my wife can see it to order presents sooner lol 😅
Amazing content on your channel. I have a dodge daytona that I might restore in the coming years, definetly will follow your tips and tricks.
I need your vacuum our car has sand
I want Christmas 🎄 book tooo:(
You are the best
I have that same Wrapping paper.   I'm pretty much Chrisfix
How do I install or make a roof rack???
29:33 Inside the truck a little surprise 😳
Add distilled water to your steamer, tap water just leaves deposits that’ll clog it over time.
I was trying to get the ratchets and they are unavailable 🙁
Coop said forget the presents, just give me the wrapping paper dammit... 😂🤣😂🤣
Bro the book took me out that is so cute😭😭😭
CHRIS! I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION! I have a column shift f350 auto but would like to put a full range gear selector in it since I pull a lot, but don't want a full Manual conversion. Is it possible?  Maybe even a clutch-less manual. I just need to be able to select what gear the truck is in.
How many of the rachets have the first edition eched in? Mine just arrived in the mail today, very excited
Can I mix baby shampoo and water to make soapy water to clean interior and under hood of my truck
I don't know if you'll see this comment. But is there any chance for a video explaining how you clean your tools? Do you use the same funnel for oil and brake fluid for instance?
@chrisfix video request on the best car scanners.
🎄🤓🎄
How much does ChrisFix Extendable Ratchets costs ? Can you ship it to Greece
28:39 Pull out game weak 🤣 all jokes aside Merry Christmas Chris, thank you for all you have taught us throughout the years
Your dog's Christmas spirit is undeniable!
will you ever do a face reveal? possibly at 10 million subs?
1:42 @chrisfix Ok, usually don’t buy other YouTuber’s Merch, but this BOOK and the drawings and style is just so good, ordered 1 for my nieces. Think they’ll like, along w/ my sister….think she’ll get a kick out of the book, and the QR code w/ you reading was an awesome idea, btw. Thx and cheers✌🏻
0:20 @Chrisfix OMG, Chris, I actually have that same wrapping paper and used it this year for gifts, LOL! All but the green Santa paper,that is. That’s so funny, and a coincidence 🤔😂😂
whats the price of the extendable ratchets?
The book is good
A Chrisfix Amazon store link with all your favorite and recommended gear would be awesome!
hi
Hey Chris, what happened to the #Driftstang
Your videos are incredible! Any chance of making a video showing how you make your videos?
7 years before: im gonna put a supercharger in the next video 7 years later: nope christmas gift ideas
When u installing ur super charger and turbo???
I always carry a multitool with me on my side no matter where I go. I get obsessed over having the right tools to be prepared for anything that could go wrong.
Ryobi and Ridgid also both have other tire inflators
You’re bad Chrisfix! Now I have to wait for the next Christmas to justify buying these new toys (tools) 😅
Hahaha...awesome vid as always. My wife just wished it would have pop-up sooner so that she had time to get your extending wrenches.....food-for-thought for next yr?
Merry Christmas Chris! Your videos are awesome! I think you are making the car community a better place by making it easier for people who have never worked on there own cars before feel like these tasks aren't so intimidating. You're awesome!
What power washer do you use?
I really want to like that brake bleeder, but after reading the reviews, I want to know how to make my own. Also, I don't know how you would check for bubbles in the reservoir when you're by the back wheels.
I think another tool you could do would be a socket set to go along with the ratchets. I just went out to get a socket set today, and it was really difficult finding a complete set of just sockets. I don't need the pliers or screwdriver or whatever else, and many sets don't have 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 inch drive sockets. I think a no nonsense socket set with a foam insert or other type of toolbox storage would be awesome.
Pls make more videos on the driftstang pls i relly love it
Wassup PEEPS.. merry Christmas
Congrats on the book!! Great idea!!
To be honest Harbor Freight has a nice tire inflator for $40 that beat all the ones listed in a test. For tires under 100lbs.
I found this box about certain cars and I just think it is cool “comments”
i'm 14, learning about cars in my auto tech class, and even though there isn't anything that i've needed to apply in there, something that i will apply out in the real world is 2 of your videos that will help me restore my (hopefully) soon to be 2000 ford ranger with a bad head gasket and bad fuel pump, along with a 2018 chevy trax (she had 150k miles on her). i honestly cannot wait!!!  honestly, the book is something that's wholesome, since if you're a kid who likes cars (like me lol) they can apply that knowledge to the real world and change the tire and be on their way. i've also been here a long while since like '13?(idk, it was a while ago lol) and have sticked here for a long while since then. thanks so much!!!
in chris we trust
I love the fact you made a book, thats awesome. Ill be buying for my daughter
I remember when this channel hit 1 million subscribers. You've truly been an inspiration for everyone. I'm so proud of everything you've accomplished so far. Can't wait to see your channel hit 10 million. Happy holidays!
I need the book for my wife... lol
Where is the driftstang??
beem wondering do ypu still have the Honda del sol
Can you replace all the brake fluid with the reverse bleeder?
Do you know the physics that are taking place with the extendable ratchets that is super cool!
Anyone notice the old drive way to new drive way change around the tire inflator?
Not sure about that reverse bleeder, it may remove trapped air but i'm not too sure it would replace the old fluid
I WANT EVERYTHING!!!!!
I'm a week late seeing this video. I go to try to purchase the extendable ratchets and its sold out. Dang!
This video is definitely an annual favorite, and the amount of time and effort it takes to put together is greatly appreciated.
Cozy video
All I want for Christmas is more drift stang videos, I miss the project.
Cavity wax is crazy expensive. Chris Fix should buy and give everyone a can to try for the price of $60 a can. How can anyone justify buying it?
waiting for the ChrisFix dog sweater!! Cooper will be the model lol
Guys a good joke to pull on your girlfriends or wives is if you detail their car or at the very least use one of those extractors, once you're done tell her and be like, yo babe I sucked so many more farts out of the driver's seat than I did the passenger seat or if you detailed your vehicle and she always sits in the passenger seat once you're done tell her, yeah I cleaned my car and extracted the seats and when I did I sucked so many more farts up out of the passenger seat and I did the driver seat, gets them every time LOL
Does anyone else think he looks like the Grinch stealing people's presents considering he's in the Santa costume LOL
Whens the face reveal?
I’ve been waiting for a year trust me it’s worth the wait  Very helpful… your ratchet set is sold i want to buy some so will like to know when they will come back on Amazon
Your videos have helped me so much over the years with my cars I ordered your book to help support you keep up the great videos ChrisFix
👌 👏  you are doing a great job.  Hubs is getting a few 🎁 after Christmas that I (we) need.!! Thanks for all the helpful information you give. Merry Christmas to you ❤️.  Hope you have an Awesome New Years.
Sadly the ratchets are unavailable
Can confirm the teslong borescopes are fantastic. I got the 80 dollar one of Amazon years ago and use it at my job fairly regularly, and it's still going strong.
A bit of feedback Chris. Great video but there were far too many adverts
MENGA MINT!!!!
Man, every year.  Chrisfix is always 110% awesome.
What do you not want to make a music video for a girl don't hear about girls
OSU Mania download a song where is it and
Lotta respect for you bro. It’s become a tradition to watch your gift series while wrapping and drinking cocoa every year
I think you should send your ratchets to Project Farm as he loves to test tools. :)
Really!!... What a load of amateur BS I just use a rattle gun to undo or tighten nuts n bolts, bleeding brake well I use my Autel or Thinktooll pro to activate the ABS pump!... Chris Fix junk!
You publishing that book was a huge move much respect 💪🏼 love your content
new duramax motor for the hummer
Hello! just want to say you might want to blur the qr code in the book because someone can basically get it for free
Bro if you could come out with a foam tool chest in the future I’d give my left leg for it and pay full price of course. I love these videos. I’m the kinda person that gets motivation if I have the tools to do the job or atleast some good tools. And I’m due for a tool retooling.
10:22 It was at this very moment I realized Chris is from *Philly.*    Immediately smashed the "like" button.  Cheers!
Happy Xmas Cooper!  Best part of the video.
He called them 'lopers'??!!  Does he mean loppers?
Hey Chris you probably not gonna see this. But what breed is  Cooper beautiful dog nice Christmas 🎄 gift keep it up  but cooper stole the show
Considering I have to pull apart and build a brake system from scratch....those flare nut ratchets I think are going on the "must have" list.
If I ever got a leather man in my stocking, I would scream with joy😂
Let’s all purchase the book so Chris fix can get 9million in profit, just got mine
I’ve been watching these since the first one and I’m 19 now!!
Hey Chris perfect!! Want them all!!!
Are you going to sell the soapy wooder stickers?    Would love put one on my soapy water spray bottle I use for clay barring
Nice tahnks chris
Make a car  rechargeable baterie next video  because last time we had lights on all night. We couldn't  start a car I sure do videos get, likes and comments.
How does this work with UK measurements
Totally ordered the book! Can’t wait to read. My 6yr old is learning to read and this I hope is the first book she reads on her own.
I know a load of adults that could do with reading that book 🤣
As someone who owns both Milwaukee tire inflators, here is some advice. The M12 is a great unit but there is 1 issue with it. It says it will go to 120 psi, but it would never get to 80 psi for my truck. I went and bought the M18 and it will fill all 4 of my truck tires from 15 to 65/80 with 1 6ah battery and have power to spare.
Hey chirs could u give us an update on the driftstang please hasnt seen it in a while
The book is useful for millennials too.  😂
Idk why or how I ended up on this video but I’ll tell you what, what you did with the book is awesome man!! I like that a lot.. you got yourself a new subscriber and imma go buy some books for my kids man.. thanks!!
Ordered ur book and ratchets..
idk why i want all of this stuff i don't even own a car yet lol
27:19 so this stuff is Rusteez irl😯
I am also a heavy leatherman user, although I prefer the wave
@ChrisFix Why did you include gifts that you already bought?
Bro could sell me my own house
Thx chris thx man  I need all that free
We need a restock on your ratchet asap pleaseeeee
I think it would be funny if he played car mechanic simulator and struggled
You should make a video going over what things a person should have in a roadside survival kit
That steam cleaner is so tiny and doesn't have any tools.
That’s so awesome Chris!! Love the children’s book idea, god bless and Merry Christmas ❤️💪🏼
Extended ratchets unavailable?????
He he...Good boy Cooper !
I have a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, can the “power off and on” at stop lights feature be disabled?
Great video. Look forward to your videos. Great job.
Are more ratchet sets coming to Amazon? They are unavailable.
I'm buying that damn book and I don't even have a kid lol
WHERE IS THE DRIFT STANG!!!!!
14.99 people would buy it
I haven’t seen Chris put out a “bad” video yet but the Christmas gifts video are definitely my favorite.  I bought the extendable ratchets, the M18 inflator and of course the book for my younger girls. I already have my teenage daughters doing brake jobs, oil changes, tire rotations, etc.
Ratchet set sold out:(
Cooper is a paid actor
So good 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
You should do a video on TPMs  replacing
Hey honey that guy is outside in a santa suit and helmet again talking to himself!
Great vid! once again proving the only fix the future generations need is, ChrisFix. I grew up on your vids thanks for being so consistent!
such a cute dog
I need that camera to find and extract all my 10mm sockets from my engine bay 🤣
Could we get a project farm review of the ratchet? I'll have to leave a comment for him to see too
wow this was an amazing video!
I just ordered the book for my 5 year old.  He loves books every night and he loves watching me work on the car!  I usually hand him a crescent wrench so he can "help" with me.  Thanks for all you do, my friend.   Merry Christmas!
For the cheap money, the ryobi tire inflator is definitely worth it. I use it for my race car tires when I’m at the track and I’ve definitely gotten my money’s worth and then some.
bought a book for my nephew!
Where's the link for Cooper?
I'm going to get that book 📖 for my son
Where the links to everything?
Loved your dog helping unwrap the presents, Too cute!
Love the kid book, nice to be able to instill basic information like this in a fun book. Also not everyone takes the time to teach their kids this info so maybe this book will help our younger generation.
Next book " how to rebuild an Ls engine" please 🙏
The ChrisFix Extendable Ratchet set is sold out on Amazon. I've had the Harbor Freight version since I first started working on cars. It got stuck in one extended position after like 6 years, but they exchanged it for me pretty easily. I'd never buy another ratchet again. The added leverage is invaluable. I tell people I almost gave up working on cars when I was 16 and had the cheapest socket set you could find, and snapped a socket trying to take a brake caliper bolt off. I thought I did something wrong. My dad knew nothing about cars, always paid someone to fix his. He's surprised I know so much now. And if I don't, I can just go on youtube and someone like Chrisfix will show me how to do it. Thanks and happy holidays.
I set myself on the waitung list for the Extendable Ratchets. It will make things way easier for me. Can`t wait to buy them XD. By the way how much are they going to cost. I can`t find a price tag :D. Till then, have a nice christmas ^^
“With this ratchet, you know it won’t come loose….” WT*?!😂
Awesome ideas!
A Happy Christmas Chris from the Netherlands!!
Jack of all trades! Chef Chris! I’d totally watch a cooking channel! Thanks for the vid, great as always.
What brush did you use when showing off the vacuum extractor attachment?
Congratulations again with the book!
Love it!
You always want a sanitized rubber. 😃👍
I love how hes acutely aware that people will go straight to him when ppl need help 😆😆
This was an awesome video! Thanks Chris!
I wonder what the neighbors thought when he filmed this lol
Where are Extendable Ratchets made at?

It’s better to use distilled water in your steamer , regular water will bust it
hey i have a question i have a vw golf mk2 and my lowbeams sucks. i changed bulbs and i tried both whiter and stronger but it dont help they`re really weak and shine like 2m in front on it do u have any ChrisFix tips?
I love Christie with all my heart. When he stopped posting I was devastated. And he is back! I love this guy. Thank you chrisfix.   (I loved the comeback vid)
Whats that gient engine in the back is that a turbo on it ? 🤔
all i see is the stigs helmet on chris ._.
Honestly the milkwaukee m12 tire inflator is such a godsend. I’ve had mine for about 2-3 years now and it’s great for smaller tires like my daily driver. Not super great for trucks/off-roading tires cause it drains pretty quick.
you are my most favourite youtuber and you also act like my friend who is very kind and nice to us and teach us new things and things that are practical in life...., i saw th way you wrote the story in your book, and it was awesome for small kids who are growing up, anyways!, MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
Just as a safety tip, most likely you already know this - 6:55 don't break loose the wheel bolts by lifting, instead break them loos by pressing down - your back and spine will thank you a bunch! Cheers!
Mfer said 3 years lol man you really are a good salesman
Bruh you just showed a book for a 5 year old kid lmfao.  My 8yo daughter has read multiple Harry Potter books.  You might want to re brand that sht
FVTJK-XVHYT-24KJJ-KP4HD-996VZ  GAME PASS ULTIMATE CODE, NEW GAME PASS USERS ONLY
Love the book, well done
Your Videos are great! I just wished you would post your" Best Christmas Ideas" like a month earlier . By the time I see your great ideals for a gift, it's to late to order and get in in time. Or I could just  off my lazy ass and go to a brick and mortar store to get one?? LOL.
Those first edition ratchets sold out fast! Really wish I could’ve gotten my hands on a set! Keep up the great work Chris! Your videos are always a treat to watch. even as an experienced mechanic, I always find myself learning something new every time I watch
This guy would be the best dad ever
That was fun. Wheel wrench neat.
Hi Crisfix  Do you have any video in RUST COVERTERS? Or best video that you would recomend? I saw you have the rust prevention gift  Awesome videos…!!!
Thanks for not putting out bad products
Great idea with the book  I just ordered 3 as gifts
Update on driftstang ??
Since your making those small hand books You should make a small and quick hand book that is portable and work for different occasions that can happen to your car Now we need a name, comment for a name I guess
Those extendable ratchets sold out so quick! Wow! 🔥
😆Like
Oooh my God Chris, I just hope more and more people like you Chris n less "woke"..... n this world would more sense.....
I only watched this to watch cooper unwrap gifts
A log cabin. 🤣🤣🤣
Yaay a new video!
return of the clause
The old school lug wrench does not have deep enough sockets to properly remove today's lug nuts.  I gave mine away.
Chris do you have any advice i’m 18 years old and i’ve just finished high school but i’m honestly not sure what to study in college and what degree to get… Do you have any suggestions?
When removing lug nuts, push the ratchet or breaker bar, not pull.  I pulled my arm out of my shoulder socket by pulling on a breaker bar.
Thanks Chris, you have been teaching me lots of unique things and inspired me to start fixing my car! :)
i actually found an item I want on this list. that torque wrench 4 way. It might take a few months to get one but its a good price point for something with a case and will tighten lug nuts to factory specs
Wassup Chris. I have a serious question.  I recently took my 2005 buick century to the shop to get a thermostat put in my car. The shop messed up my fuel rail. They put a new one in and said I needed a new intake gasket. They put that in . Now my car is having a hard time starting. And when it does start it shuts off while I am driving. Do you know why that would happen? If so what can I do to fix that issue?
Congrats on the book! I just had a children's book published also, and it's been a big adventure.
Great video
But why
❤
An instant "LIKE" just for the children's book right at the beginning!👍
Serious question, why wouldn't someone want to use Cavity Wax on a new car? Is it pointless if there is no rust?
Bought the m12 inflator years ago. It's awesome! Use it on my tacoma when I go off roading. Deflate to ~20 psi and then back up to 33-35 when I'm done. One 4.0 amp battery does all 4 tires. I keep 2 spare batteries and a charger with me in the truck as well.
Man YouTube didn't tell me you had a new video, I just happened to come across it. Another great video and some really cool tools. Congrats on the extendable ratchet set and the book. I remember watching videos of you showing us how to de-dandelion your yard lol
The dog is trained so well
7:00...  I have the Pittsburgh ratchet identical to this half inch extendable ratchet it is the 1st ratchet that I ever bought and I still have it.. the thing is a BEAST... that was 15 years ago... I have upgraded my tools significantly since then but I have hung on to this ratchet it has never failed me
I immediately bought your book for my Grandson who just turned 3 months old 😍!! thank you for all you do, and Cheers from Alberta Canada 🇨🇦
Imma get those extendable ratchets just because they have chrisfix on them 💪💪💪
It's been a long while since you had a video. Awesome sh@t Chris. Keep it coming
Ordering a book for the nephews! 🥳
Hey I have that same kitchen knife. It's from a different brand but it looks 100% identical. Picked it up for $20 online a couple years ago and it makes a huge difference. I use it 90% of the time and so long as you sharpen it every so often it works great.
How much is your ratchet set? :) it’s sold out currently (congrats!) but looking to buy a set when they’re back in stock.
A weather proof battery. Maybe use super caps or LTO cells? Or solid state batteries for hot climates?
Damn he has his own brand of tools.  😎👍
That's so cool that you have your own tools and books now!! As a 16 Y/O your videos make fixing my mom's car, and eventually my own car so much easier!! Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas man!!
brilliant love this might buy some of these
I saw that little lever on the rachet the other way when trying to take bolts off. But still good job on the new stuff.
I know what I’m getting myself for Christmas…. The chris fix ratchet set
WHERES THE DRIFTSTANG?????
What happened to the drifstang
Kinda wish I was notified when your video got uploaded to get one of the extended ratchet sets
I got one of the last ratchets, super excited!
The book is awesome! I will definitely be getting my son that!
Kids book is such a dope idea! You have done such a great job over the years. Let’s keep the younger generations appreciating how cool cars are!
What does the knife have to do with cars?
Damn that reverse bleeder I want!
This dude just casually says for when he is shark fishing
His neighbors looking out and seeing him 👁👄👁
The ratchets are sold out 😢
Hey everyone I will just pass on a valuable tip! If you buy that lug torque wrench whenever you use it ALWAYS back off the torque setting as low as possible when you store the tool!  Otherwise it will lose its calibration.
Happy holidays from your Air Force fan here in FL. I just bought your book for my 4 yr old and i know he'll love it. Now I'm off to look for some kid swag for 3 kings lol. Keep Rockin!
the ChrisFix ratchet set is sold out. will there be more in stock soon?
Immediately bought my son the book! Gonna be a good birthday present.
Am I lucky to get tools from Chris this year? I need the useful tools replacing my strut. Frustrated with the rusty bolts.😩
The worksharp precision adjust is also great for a more narrow list if needs. Better for knives in general
Ratchets sold out already?
I love that you wrote a book!  So cool. My kids will be getting one!
Some great ideas for Christmas 🎄 thanks and merry Christmas 🎅
I love this series, I always send these to my mom when she says “give me some more ideas”
Just in time for the delivery eta .....
NEVER i mean NEVER EVER use one of those sharpeners on knifes you care about
Meanwhile my ratchets with no additional leverage. Krruunch...
The kid's book is so cute, Mr. Fix. Out with the old, in with the new year💯
Hey Chris! Thanks for the great Christmas gift ideas. You gave me many interesting recommendations for my car and Alfa Romeo of my brother. About your book I wish you to have a big success; I'm sure you'll help to learn a lot of things to the children (maybe future ChrisFIxs Ahah) and that makes me happy personally! Hope to find any child to gift this book and support you for a good cause. Greetings from Italy and Have a nice Christmas Holiday!
I always watch these videos to buy stuff for my self lol
Chris went from a super subtle chill guy making how to videos about cars to a hard right wing conservative to please his elders. Bummer. I only knew of him YouTube until I started to his comments on other social media. I loved this guy, not it’s hard to watch his videos and not remember his comments on other threads. Don’t call yourself a patriot when you’re really a nationalist.
Chrisfix, what happened to the driftstang?
Should do a birthday series aswell
I am SO offended that this video is only for car guys and girls!! Can't us self-identifying NA Miatas have any love?!?!?
The SAE and the METRIC bolt gouges is the items I need to get chrisfix
I'll buy the book for my kid, yes. Defenetley for my kid that I totally have and isn't made up.
Can’t wait until @projectfarm puts @chrisfix branded tool to the test! Even without the test, I’m getting a set to help support @chrisfix for all the help you’ve provided us over the years! Thanks Chris!
Well, it's Santa with helmet.. 👍😂😂
I absolutely love the children's book! My son is a toddler right now but I've already placed an order for a copy. My grandfather was a master mechanic for over 40 years and my dad is a weekend warrior mechanic for all his friends. They both passed on their love of cars to me, and I'll be doing the same for my son. I can't wait to show him how to do basic maintenance and teach him how to approach problems. Keep doing you, man!
Great vids, loose the helmet. Either be out there, or don't. The helmet is a silly ruse and goofy...
I’m bout to go bankrupt if he keeps showing me more awesome tools.😂
I think I have the generic set of the Chris fix Extendo reach ratchet as exact one and blue just doesn’t have your name on it. Got it like two years ago that’s awesome.
Love this list keep it up. Thank you so much for all you do.
8 thousand to break even danggg😬
Where are the drift car vids
Hey, with the bore scope and the cavity wax, you've got yourself a DIY colonoscopy kit!
Might have to cop the Rachet set
Waited  on this for a year
I had a flat at the track and someone loaned me their ryobi tool to air it back up. I ordered one just a couple minutes later, pretty good product for the price. I'd like the m18 milwaukee one but so steeply priced
Realy cool stuff, mery christmas.
Chris my guy, these vids should be out the week of black friday.
we bought a book for my girlfriends nephew!...wait wait wait you went to culinary school????
POV: you buy all these things for yourself lmao
just ordered the Ratchets. hope they are a first edition
There is actually a few things I plan on buying this time
Hey @ChrisFix I would love to see the mustang on the channel for Christmas 😊
👍👍
Cooper taking off with the wrapping paper😂😂
You gotta start releasing these like in the beginning of December big dawg.
Excellent content as usual, Chris!  Pick with a hole is a leather punch/needle.
I bought that carpet cleaner because you recommended it, but it was weak and didn't hold much.  I had been using a spray bottle and $50 shop vacuum. You also suggest a vacuum attachment and admit it works better?! Just get that! You could buy a shop vac and attachment for less than the carpet cleaner!
Were can you get theirs things for me dad for Christmas
Can you get this book in a store and kind of store
Purchased the book immediately for my 2 year old. nice job!
When you showed me Avlon King in one of your Christmas gift videos that changed my life. I have coated every car me and my family owns. It is also the best for the windshield.
Loving that little easter egg engine in the back. Is that gonna be for the hummer?
I always love watching your Christmas edition video and that book you made looks awesome I need to get my hands on one!
Loved seeing you wearing the Asics brand of shoes. They're good shoes.
gas cap light stuck on any suggestions. gas cap replaced,smoke test done, new fuel pump and fuel filter done still on and also my 03 ses Taurus revs high at low speeds at 10mph reaches 2,000rpm keeps going and scratches  have to slow down for the rpm to drop at that low of a speed! It has 79k miles help!!?
Merry Christmas to you.   Those were great gift ideas.
Great work man, I ordered a copy of your book!  My kids love "helping" me with car stuff.
got a sneaky early presy from mum this year,kingcrome spanner set is the best gift evaaaaaaa.(they're siny)😊
Lol dude who's ripping you off?!?!?!? 1 dollar a book per 10? Na sorry but this is one time I don't believe you. To make it, probably 2 or 3 bucks and to sell somewhere around that too I bet. It's nothing high profile either. Idk, I feel you should be getting 3bucks minimum.  And doing it yourself I bet. Idk it's all fishy. But I do kind of want it for my niece.
Thanks to Chris I got the confidence to start working on cars, thank you so much!
Nice! Love everything
Is it just me or do u wanna buy the book regardless of ur age. I'm 19 lol and I need it
New subcriber here, i been watching your very helpful video, im not a mechanic but i want to learn all about engine and cars.
Maannnnnnn i love you Chris! You got my like within the first 5 min with that little book! Congratulations on publishing a book seriously! I’ve been watching your videos since the beginning and I watch every single one you release. Thanks for all the effort you put into your videos and all the great content you put out :) merry Christmas!!
Good stuff Chris, and I really like your custom ratchets! Merry Christmas :)
You should make your own tools like you did with the ratchets
Why not make the book in to pdf version aswell
28:27 😏😏😏 ur welcome
That nut and bolt tester isn’t a stocking stuffer when it’s coming in at 150+ dollars man 😂
11:20 - Hey! That's a gnarly looking driveway. You should do something about that. 😁
Sweet idea, a knife sharper for my daily car knife.
That book is adorable. Mini Chris is so cute! Such a good idea
Been waiting for you to come out with tools
315$ canadian for the nut and Bolt gauge... what a joke
**Watching for things to gift to myself**
Love the idea of the book. There are so many practical things that we are not taught in school. Congrats!
Respect from Georgia 🇬🇪
Got the book for my nephew. He just turned 1, so he's still a bit young, but he's already walking short distances by himself, so he might get to reading a bit sooner than we anticipated. Thanks, Chris.
Christmas is a ultra pagane believe
Extractor vacuums are amazing
I’m sorry but I think Cooper was the main star of this video
Chris went to culinary school? Very surprised lol. Anyways, excellent video, very well thought out gifts.
Love these videos every year I just wish it was dropped earlier…..
Give me some of that gift man. Support from the Philippineeees 😅
you should make a children's book on how to change a light bulb in a head light or taillight. Two other good ideas are replacing a fuse or find was causes to fuse to pop and repairing a tear in a seat.
Who else wanna see Chris fishing ? 😅
question what is your favorite color
Well, I’ve officially come to the realization that I have way too much shit lol
That children’s book would be gold for me as a kid
I have the Ryobi inflated.  Love it!!!!   Saves major headaches to keep motorcycle tires full.
You really wanted to make it a point that is mechanic Santa. You even got them gloves on.😂😂😂 Marry Christmas and Happy New Year. Thank you for all your helping videos and knowledge.🎉🎉🎉🙏🙏🙏🤗🤗👍👍👍
The leaterman is a good idea. I prefer the wave but the free is good also.
It’s amazing how how far Chris has come. this guy started out just making videos, Now he does this full time and he is the best YouTube mechanic I’ve ever seen  Love you Chris love your videos keep it up brother 🤜🤛
Battery inflator is cool, but I rather leave a 12v dc  one in my car in case of emergency 😁
Where is del sol build?
Great gifts for DIYers ?
I have the ryobi inflator its awesome
another great video chris!!! thank you!
I think I saw this book advertised on Amazon. That's awesome!!!
That book!!! Dude, best idea ever. I'm picking a copy up for my nephew. He's obsessed with cars and always wants to be around when I'm working on my good ol' E46. It's perfect for him. Happy Holidays!
Nice video we want a video how to prepare your car when it starts snowing
That book is amazing. Thank you for teaching the young. You’re awesome Chris
Very cool products🛠️🧰
Hows going with drift stang
chris just letting you know you shown the qr code some people might be able to use that
Are those flared nut wrenches available in Metric? I've not had a car with imperial fasters since 1993.
My dad got me letherman original (not the new "original") 10years ago and i still love it because the quality is good+sharp saw and knife is always needed and the file is probably best file that i own
keep going im a big fan from the old videos even if i don't have a car...😅😅
A week before Christmas? Come on man that’s way too late to start shopping. What’s the holdup ?? Just kidding Thank you for the hard work and great content
You were in culinary school?!?  Please tell us more!
9:45 I'm already saving to buy this next year, love this gadget since I watched your deep cleaning video 👌🏼
So cool to see a book of yourself and only wanting to help the future generations ❤️
Your Hummer doesn't have inboard mounted brakes?!?! Is that something you changed, or is that just a difference between the civilian and the military models?
I'm buying the book just for the transparency
Chrisfix you are my favorite YouTuber
Been watching for years love your content.congrats on the book.keep it up!
when del sol turbo?
If you have some rust inside the frame tube wouldnt spraying inside trap in the moisture without cleaning first?
All these tools & gadgets we’ll leave me bank rupt
we need sone chrisFix fishing videos!
7 years? Damn
Great video thank you for showing the reverse bleeder kit I never knew there was one
Ok all of these are amazing gifts—but where do we get ourselves a Cooper?
Awesome job man you knocked it out! I don't think there is one thing on there I don't want or need!
Happy holidays, Chris! May the best of 2022 be the worst of 2023!
I need all of this.. i bought myself a mekita dtw300z formyself, so im sett on an impact wrench.
I wait for this all year long
Paused the video, ordered the book resumed the video.
And now i want to go spend money i dont have on almost all of these gadgets. 🥲
I could have used a flex head ratcheting flare nut set yesterday.  If you've ever changed the fuel filter on an 87 S10 2.8, you'll understand
Alex from legitstreecars needs that camera
this man is a genius selling a kids book
Do you have a video on servicing a cvt?
Those ChrisFix comfort grip ratchets are sick!
I dont have a car yet. But YOU BET im buying these!
You should blure the QR  code
Where can we get those product?
Touch screen radio with a ps5 :v
If the kid is wearing a helmet doesn’t it get in the way to change a tire?
A quick question. Since you did the Christmas gift video, can you do an additional video on your picks for snow chains? I'm curious to see what your recommendations are :)
I'm definitely buying the book
we need more drift cars
So what you gonna give me for Christmas from the list 🤔
Just bought the book for my 3 year old daughter. Hopefully she will follow in my footsteps, and learn how to be a good person
Why so many ads 🤷‍♂️
Nice
Can you please do a dfp cleaning video
Yeah. I'm a mechanic. What I've done to my car myself you ask? I put on the license plates, replaced the rear wiper blade and and filled up the washer fluid.
1/4 of the video is an ad, but still decent. Thanks!
This video makes car guys and car girls got more ideas for their automotive works and it changed the game🥳💚❤️
Hi chrisfix I have a problem
Ah yes, one of my most awaited videos of the year.
Wait, ChrisFix is ChrisChef!?! Come on man!!! Let's see some cooking videos!
Hey are you able to make a detailed guide on how to pull an engine out of a car its fine if not or if you need to wait till one of the car has a bad engine whilst your not doing the lemons race or something
Class video mate, have a great Christmas!
Chris what happened with the mustang
Finally !!! I was waiting for this video for an year!
No flashlights this year? Was hoping the new Milwaukee pen lights would have made it. Super handy as an EDC!!
good job bro
I'm 11 and I like your chanel
The brake fluid pusher looked like cheap garbage
Comment algorithm compliance
Definitely gonna order a set of the extendo mag ratcheting wrenches😂 gonna improve the cleanliness and organization of my US General box
Very good video 📹 👍
This is perfect my brother in law is really into cars and I really wanted an idea of what to get him. Thanks for the help! 😅
When are we gonna see the new supercharger and installation tutorial on your mustang, I have an sn95 myself and definitely want to do the same!
The only bad thing about this video is that all these amazing tools I discover each year don't usualy ship to my country ... :'(
5:40 what about the ones in the middle bro? They look exactly like the ones on the left? Except they don’t have the Chrisfix logo
Wow, Chris you’ve come along way 😅 tools and book nice man
Take the cover off
Will Project Farm test your ratcheting set?
Low key not a children’s book we all are thinking of that one sibling who drives but don’t know how to change a flat tire.😂😂 But never fails to impress me with your videos.
I literally went back and saw your car detailing video about a week ago and really thought about getting a vacuum extractor and steamer then I see the top gadgets of 2022 video. Oh yeah it’s a sign! Lol getting them both! 🤣🤟🏼
We’ve all waited a year for this😎
Almost thought you weren’t going to make it this year! @chrisfix
Awesome video Chris keep up the great content👍
13:57 berry hot
Love your videos men 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Can we honestly all say that we've been waiting all year for this video?
Another amazing  Christmas gift video !!  Do you have a video of fixing a steering wheel not being straight. I have a 2003 mustang
9+ million subscribers. Holy smokes. Well deserved too. Goes to show that being a good man and building credibility over the years pays off.
I've been waiting for this video for about 364 days
Not going to lie, I paused the video just to go buy the book. Good Job man. My sons will love this. Love your channel. Merry Christmas Chris!!!
I thought using a torque wrench is bad when loosening lug nuts? ChrisFix is doing just that?
Chrisfix is the most hard working man on YouTube here since 2018
im convinced i had the ratcheting flare nut idea in my head a couple years ago XD told myself whoever creates it is gonna be very successful lol
I hate Christmas.
D u d e.    👍 😎 👍
Here's my Leatherman endorsement, for what it's worth.  My buddy and I were hired as summer relief broadcast engineering technicians in summer 2010 for a local TV and radio station.  He already had a decent Leatherman and another cheaper model. I used the cheaper one for a little bit after we got hired and out of my first paycheque, I went to Canadian Tire and bought the Leatherman Wave.  I used it very regularly in that role and have had other technical jobs (computers, networking, broadcast, etc.) since where it has come in handy.  I currently work as a teacher, but I still use the Leatherman (the same one I bought 12 years ago) on at least a weekly basis and I don't do any technical work without it on my side.  Without a question the best $100 I have ever spent on a tool. You'd be an idiot to be a Do-It-Yourselfer and not own one.
Cooper is such a good dog!
The book would also be awesome as a gag gift for someone that don't know how to change a flat tire
Awe yeah that time a year again
Very happy with my Oil Udder from Last year!!!
Can’t believe I used to get so excited for toys but now it’s tools
Hoping for a decent breaker bar this Christmas....for these rusty a** seized up nuts and bolts
I love that book great job I need a kid
The first one is brilliant if you have a toddler
Hands down using a reverse brake bleeder should be the STANDARD method for bleeding brake systems!
Hi Chris. Did you take a lot of inspiration for the extending ratchets from the ones you reviewed in your 2018 Christmas gift ideas?
Need to cop me a Chris fix tool set
Me buying a kids box to support chrisfix
this is a good idea thank you for posting this video
When are you going to supercharge or turbocharge the diftstang?
I never buy anything, but I love watching these Christmas gift ideas videos every year!
The stick
What is that big turbo engine in the back of the truck at 29:33??? Is it a leak for future videos? :))) btw really enjoying the content, you are cool man :))
Cant wait for 2023 ver
Very informative, Thanks Ctris
With the tire pumps the ryobi and Milwaukee are the exact same Chinese company
Bought the book for my son as soon as I learned it existed
Chris fixs book more useful then most schools for kids
Holy crap 240 bucks for ratchets ? To rich for my broke ass lol
One day ill work on my own car, one day...
Could you use the reverse brake bleeder to bleed a clutch slave cyclinder?
Thx Chris!
Cool stuff this year
Merry Christmas, Chris!
A video would be such an awesome visual supplemental addition to the book!  As a mother, especially of teenage girls, it is terrifying this day and time knowing there's a chance they could have a flat on the road and be stranded there waiting for help and a car full of bad people with cruel intentions pull up behind them. With no fatherly figure around to teach them, a short tutorial video would help millions of clueless girls and boys alike! Yes, there are thousands of vids on YouTube but your reputation and name alone perks up the ears of our youth and draws them to you. A simple video by ChristFix could save the lives of thousands. Wow. Just an idea my friend. Love you!  Kéep doing your thing!
You need to release this a little earliernin yhe month so theres more time to get them
❤
Cooper is soo awesome 😎
Hi chris i need some help with my own daily where i swapped engine (exactly same engine as before the swap) The problem with it is that when engine is cold it takes a while to start it up but it starts run smooth etc. But the real problem becomes when temperature gets up to like 80°C operating temperature and i ahut off the car an try start it up i wont start i have replaced all the temp sensors and starter motor in car but it didnt change anything and my car is 2007 skoda octavia mk2 combi with 2.0TDI PD and engine code is BKD
Hey Google never recommend this channel again
Chris Fix is awesome always up with automotive technology updates in all areas of the spectrum outside of automotive this guy is the absolute best, everyone have an awesome Christmas and New Year.
Chris is #48 trending?! CONGRATS DUDE! You've earned it.
Most helpful video ! Thanks for the ideas Chris !
As soon as I saw the book, I showed it to my parents as a gift for my little siblings.
Chris fix you aren’t the hero the internet wanted. You’re the hero the internet needed.
"And then a few ChrisFix videos later with everything all fixed"  Love when creators are both entertaining, informative, and funny!
Chris is the man, love these videos almost as much as his April Fool’s videos. For a tire inflator I always prefer the 12v. No need to worry about batteries. It’s saved me several times.
I’m relatively new to this channel so I’ve never seen a Christmas video by Chrisfix, so I was pretty surprised when I saw him jump in front of the camera wearing a Santa suit😅 Thanks for another awesome video man!
Liked before watching cause you already know
this list was FIRE
Don't forget that decibels are logarithmic so a 10 decibel difference is actually quite a lot in perceived loudness.
Does anybody REALLY LIKE working on their car or is it just a necessity for broke boys and girls
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 keep it up
I've been wating for this video to
What’s up Chris! You’ve helped me a lot over the years as a DIY guy.
I don’t work on cars as much as I used to, but I’ll always come back for Chris fix’s Christmas gift ideas
I love the book!!!!
bro
Lovely dog That cavity wax is nice
Happy Holidays everyone!
The book idea is awesome. Just ordered for my kids.
Congratulations on the book and tools
okay but what kind of soap does ChrisFix use in his SoapyWooder? I need to know
You have some stuff that I'd love to get for xmes and I plan on asking for it next year, I feel like 10 days before Christmas is kinda short notice for gifts since my family usually gets lists and starts shopping in the beginning of december, so I'd definitely recommend you put out this video a day or two before december just to give people more time (also you should get more tools with your name on it cause thats fricken awesome!)
You went to culinary school!? You love boats… Same here! 😂
Man you are such a gift to viewers. I've watched so many of your videos and learned so much thanks to you and your content. Thank you very much Chris! Happy Holidays :)
Hello, ChrisFix. Thank you for your always enjoyable videos. I really liked the Extendable Ratchet Set you introduced in this video. I was able to order it from Japan to Amazon in the U.S. and am very much looking forward to its arrival. Thank you very much.
Please test cataclean.
Hey Chris,  Great video as always.  Please release this type of video earlier next year, need time to be able to get these under the tree by Christmas morning.
Bonus on the Leatherman Free: all tools can be opened one-handed. Useful for when your hand is stuck holding something in place, and you just need a tool quick
That book is a great idea for kids. I know plenty of adults that can't change a tire. Always look forward to your videos.
I’m just waiting for this guy to post a video revealing his brand new house!! That’s my prediction at least!
I have not purchased the "Chris Fix" branded tools, however I do own the same type of tools shown in this video, and need to say a few words about them. I am 42yrs old, and have been working on my own vehicles, as well as the vehicles of family and friends for 25yrs now. The ratcheting open ended wrenches, and the extendable ratchet drivers shown in this video are absolutely a must have for someone like me that has needed these specific tools over the years, and if you know a "car person", or have one in your family that doesn't already own these tools, I highly suggest them as great gifts. They will get used and these are the types of tools that are essential when put in a position where they are needed such as tight spaces ( which  become more common in vehicles every year), and where leverage is needed. I have used the classic "cheater bar" on wrenches many times,  and my extendable driver is infinitely more valuable, as a set length cheater bar cannot be used in certain areas that an extendable driver where you choose the length can be used (like working underneath a vehicle when it is parked on the ground). Try getting a turn of a wrench or driver with a long cheater bar when there is only 18" of clearance between the vehicle and the ground. ( you often can't, do it with a leverage bar, but you can when you have an extendable socket driver that allows you to extend only far enough to get the leverage you need to break a nut or bolt free). If anyone watching this video questions whether or not these tools would be used by a "do it yourself" person, I can assure you they will get much use. In addition I have had tire inflator's over the years, and have used them countless times, not just on vehicle tires that are low or flat, but also to inflate toy's, ball's, and air mattresses.  I also own 3 inspection cameras, one like the one shown towards the end of this video here, and though I haven't yet used it on my vehicle's,  I have used it in my home several times. ( looking inside walls for dead rodents, and inside vent ducts to find torn ducting). They are all valuable to be.
:O I'm going to ask my dad right now
I saw the ratchets in the video…didn’t even get to the end of the video before buying them.
Me sitting in my bed sending it to my mom so I can get it for Christmas be like 😊😊😊
@chrisfix race vs drift video which is mustang vs bmw? I was still wondering if you plan on it if so just put my name in the video or not, thx for all of the help and information, influence also positively you bring. Have a Merry Christmas hope to see more videos!!!!❤️‍🔥💯
Wonder if Torque Test Channel would test your new extendable ratchets and do a price to power comparison like with other hand tools.   Huh, would you ever make a video on that reverse bleeder? Guessing with it you'd need to pump out the brake reservoir since you're pumping fluid from the opposite direction.
Just bought the rachets. Have been a diesel mechanic for 8 months now and still look forward to these videos. So helpful on my personal vehicles.
Where is the “Honey, the neighbor is dressed like Santa Claus again this year” comment😂?
I’ve used all those inflators, but the best is the handheld Rigid. It is also the most compact, less than half the cost of the Milwaukee, and a lifetime warranty. You can’t beat it, and I’m a Milwaukee fan.
the best gift from chris would be a face reveal
ChrisFix is hands down the BEST car YouTuber. Nobody like him
I love your Chanel. Did many stuff what you showed and i am no mechanic 😅. Keep up the good job. Greetings from Poland and Merry Christmas Chris 😇😇
With the reverse brake bleeder, do you have to pull out some of the brake fluid before use the bleeder and put more fluid in the lines? If so, do you pull it from the cylinder or the bleeder valve? Lastly, do you still go in order from farthest line from the cylinder to the closest when using this?
It's weird that the Milwaukee M12 costs more than the M18.
Can u give us a update on the driftstang plz
I literally bought your extendable ratchets as soon as you opened them up. Cannot wait till they get here 👍
Ratcheting flare nut looked awsome
Awesome!!
As a mom and grandma, you make me the cool gifting Boomer! Thanks for that! Merry Christmas!
Can't wait to get them all
Hey Chris, love the video, I think it would be great if you tried for next year to have no Chinese products on the list!
As much as I like my extendable ratchets, I don't need it as much as I use anti-seize on anything that doesn't require loctite.
Cooper is adorable man love cooper
I've learned a lot from this channel and day by day I'm getting more interested in working on cars though I'm not an expert 😁😁
There is no video in the world that can beat one of these videos , we very much thank you Chris, merry Christmas 🫶🥹🍾
That book is awesome! You truly are an awesome man Chris
My sons are 4y/o and 9 months, guess who’s kids are getting books about changing tires?! 😁
I just love to bing watch your videos…i repeat them…i learn and feel entertained…love cooper the dog, good little buddy
Been watching this man for years and the last thing I thought would come out of his mouth was “When I went to culinary school” 😂😂 Love that ChefChris!
Just fyi on the multi tool. The pick with a hole is a speed awl. Useful for leather working, fixing a tent, poking a hole in something, saving your knife tip, etc.
Car guys and car girls?. Did you assume my gender?. How dare you??. 😂😂
That kid's book is both helpful and adorable..
Did we ever get the supercharger video?
Ordered 2 copies of your book! Looks like you did a great job with it. Excited to see it. It will make a great gift for a friend of mine and his kid as well as for my little girl❤ thanks Chris!
will the Chrisfix Ratchet come to Canada ?
Hey ChrisFix if you publish this some days ago, 9:24 i could save a "tons" of USD importing an american "regular brake fluid purge"... thanks guy... Is not yout problem, but i save a "tons" of USD for buying the old one that "sometimes dosnt work"
Wow, I commented the Ryobi Inflator on your Instagram post about a month ago and you picked it! I’m so glad you shared this amazing tool. Keep up the great vids Chris. We all love watching them❤❤
Gotta get me a cordless tire inflator. Another good xmas video. Ive been following since before you had a million subs. Now its 9.3! Good for you Chris. Merry Xmas everyone.
Hey Chrisfix, do you reccomend the Milwuakee M12 as a tire inflator to keep in your car just incase you get into a flat? Thanks!
Why don’t you just show your face already??????  I know a lot of people know who you are already.
I like when Chris does this !
i dont care that im 24 i need that book!
I like the Line Wrench Crows Foot tools on a ratchet and extension.
this one time I will do something nice for myself and buy a Chris fix picture book
Chrisfix when is there gonna be a drift video or putting a turbo on that honda i wanna hear the stututu on that honda
Bro made a 20 min ad 😢
You need to put these videos out in November
I bought the reverse brake bleeder and I love IT!!
I bought the book.  Never supported a patreon or anything. But I bought this one. Thank you for all the help.  I have employer access to diagnostic software now. But in the beginning a lot it was you. Thanks.
Leatherman or Victorinox better?
Fagg
I really disliked the way you are selling your branded product as a christmas gifts. At least keep your stuff separate. None of that stuff is actually useful for home mechanic.
Chris I clicked on your extendable ratchet link and it says they're unavailable. Am I doing something wrong? Btw I'm in Quebec, Canada don't know if that's an issue but I'd really like to buy them
This video is just wow wow wow!! ❤❤❤ congrats on your own line of tools and book!!!!!!
Funny I watched a video of yours talking about extendable socket wrenches, and I was like I need a set of them. And here you came out with your own set. I took it as a sign and bought your set. But love your videos. Super helpful and informative.
I. Love the reverse brake bleeder. Very important
Hey Chris! I'd recommend checking out the ridgid tire inflator at home depot. Thats the one i got and its quicker than my friend's milwaukee one!
My life getting easier and easier every year.
Thanks Chris for the time you take to help others. Have a Great Christmas!
What would cause you steering wheel to be hard to turn to the right but not to the left on a 97 Chevy 1500 four-wheel drive
911? Yeah, My neighbors holding a camera and talking to Christmas presents again...
I send this to my wife year after year and still get pots and pans. Maybe lead with, a woman posing in clothes and call it best damn shirt ever. Lol
Great video 👌🏽
Wait what? You went to culinary school? I want to see you do a cooking video now
Great vid
I just bought some of your rachets. Can't wait to try them out, great video.
Happy to support your Brand and you tube Channel Mr Fix. Your videos have saved me thousands of dollars over the years. I look forward to using the new extending ratchets.
Chit is one of the most positive people out there
Love these vids chris!!  Congrats on the book!!!!
Watching Chris fix so happy make me happy myself
I wonder🤔
Massive thanks for the tip on carressing insulation of the car doors with grease or whatever + the door locks! -91 volvo
You are almost at 10 million!
Hi  Chris i vbeen on this channel for a Very Long time 10 years to be exact and its the one and only channel that never changed even with fame ! i am really proud of u Chris and we are the same Age ! i really really wish u the best
Merry Christmas Chris fix
I'll buy my first Chrisfix tool after it survives a project farm beat down
You should register the chrisfix logo. Then you get to use (r) instead of tm. I know it is a hassle but looks cooler.
You have outdone yourself once again! Good job! Keep it up!
I’m 11
You’re recording this lengthy video in a below-freezing temperature? RESPECT!!! Love from San Diego
Sub to crhisfix i want crishfix to get 10mil
Have to get the Chris fix set for myself!!
Your hummer looks sooo freaking cool! 👍👌✊💯
Have a 10 year old Leatherman Blast. Love it
When you say "OK Cooper" at 8:13 it activates my Google assistant
I love the list like always but personally prefer fluid film for my rust protection.
A christmas present I would want is to see your face
Not a fan of his voice or the intros so ill pass but thanks for the thumbnail
crhisfix do you remember when you renovated your driveway
I got one of those extractor vacuums this late spring and ended up deep cleaning my parents volvo wagon. The thing was like new! It went from being kinda junky with stains on the seats and muddy carpets to basically immaculate. It did take a few days to do everything from a exterior wash to vacuuming out doghair to cleaning all the plastics windows and finally the wet vac on all the carpet and upholstery. But definitely worth it, highly recommend it
Love your videos, a lot, there is just one tool I don't like, pushing oil into the brake system, sometimes, and specially on newer kinky abs systems and master cilinders, it may dislodge the seals on the master cylinder, I usually vacuum the oil off the bleeder valve, so new oil can come down to the caliper and no oil flows backwards. I've already had trouble pushing oil back on a merc and had the master cylinder rebuilt which was a dirty pain :) When working the brakes I even lock the flex oil line with a caliper made specially for it with rubber jaws :)
Can u continue drifting with driftstand i mostly love that videos
28:38 "did you pull out" "mmhmm yup"
I am buying your Ratchet! When I had my car broken down your videos help me and saved me and my family a lot of money. I only had 1 car now I own 3 cars and they run perfect my neighbors think I am a mechanic. I am just a guy watches YouTube with homedepo tools. It supports you and is a tool!
Hi pls shout me in next vid I wish for Christmas is a shout-out
I look forward every year for ideas to buy for myself. I will buy your book bro!
I own a junky car and you help me make it a speed machine
I love you, Chris you are so down-to-earth and genuine that it warms my heart. I will be buying  the children's book and spreading the word.
Your the best hope the soapy water racers win next race
nice engine on top of your mazda!!!
I cannot afford to pay the man enough to show my appreciation for his content, but since I learnt that YT pays according to ad views, I have found that the best way I can show my appreciation is to like and never skip an ad on any of his videos. Never forgetting to share his videos whenever I get the chance. He is such a genuine guy and I wish nothing but the best for him. I can't wait for the channel to hit 10M subs, it deserves it. Cheers to many more years of much more informative, exciting and educative content.
My fav part of every year 🎉
Cooper!
Creative Hint for those like me in cold climates such as Central Wisconsin. Purchase a USB powered warm pad(s) and use them around any spray can if outdoors to help keep not just pressurisation but atomization of the products you use when applying them in cold conditions. 😉
In the future i will give the book too my kids
I was really impressed with the multitool, it has everything that I use the most. I couldn't find any but now I've found.  But honestly dude you are a life saver, now I'm 15 and I know how to change oils and stuff
Nice!!!!sending my wife this extendable ratches link for my Christmas gift. Ha.. goodjob buddy
Cooper stole the show
My son is almost 2 and has shown a huge interest in cars on his own (I'm a car guy but I never pushed the car thing on him) he's a little young yet but I'm definitely gonna buy that book. Looking foreward to more, we will collect them all!
I like how you used the Griswold Station Wagon in your book.
I've the m12 inflator and it's absolutely fantastic. Would recommend
I love my Pressure washer and portable Bissell carpet cleaner for pet and automotive use. Not easy getting rid of a 15 year old smell in a vehicle but with those items it's doable.
As a person that sharpens my own knives, that test was absolutely trash. It didn't prove that the knife was properly deburred, or that it was actually sharp, it just shown that it was somewhat sharp. Good thing for sharpening garage knives. Kitchen knifes, multittols, daily knives etcetera - Stay away from them.
Chris I freaking love you man
Great. Just when I already gave my Christmas list. Because my birthday is the 25th I gotta wait another year! If I don’t laugh I’ll cry. 😂 But anyway Merry Christmas to all!
Lmao
Epic as always! 🔥
Chris published a children's book?! Oh man!
Love the ideas but has to be the most expensive year.
Santa, I want everything ChrisFix showed Us, and I mean every thing !!!!!!!!!!!
JEREMIAH 10;3-5
28:34 oh 😳
Every year I look forward to this! Thanks again for all the awesome suggestions. Def picked up the ratchet set :)
I just bought the book for my nephew. He's 6 and loves cars and basketball.
That book idea is amazing
I might not be a kid but I’m buying that book
THOSE RATCHING CROW FOOT ARE THE BEST
Why do you never show your face in your videos?  Greetings from Bulgaria!
For my extended families present exchange this year I bought my cousin 10 10mm sockets and called it good
That lug torque wrench is suspicious. If you add leverage the tq value increases. Not sure how you’d get an accurate torque reading if the leverage is variable
Chris a advice when your parking your car on any road first put the gears on N and then lift the hand brake then turn off the car the put the can in park this will prevent damage to the transmission
I wish i had some money this christmass:( to buy sm for my familly
Pretty awesome about your first book man!  Great idea. And the extendable ratchets look sweet too.  I think I'm going to get a set of those ratcheting flare nut wrenches.  You're a good salesman!
They havnt made a good leather man in 10 years
Merry Xmas ChrisFix!
a
My favorite childhood YouTuber for 7 years has grown up so much! I always rewatch your videos for fun. Much love to you and your family! Happy holidays!
I really wish these would come out start of December/ end of November so I can actually ask for these at Christmas
Finaly!
I'm 15 and I'd buy that book
Yes I finally
i wouldn't use the reverse brake bleeding in a car since it's going to get all the "crap" back in to the ABS system. but I can definitely use it for bike disc brake bleeding since it was designed for reserve bleeding.
Cooper is adorable. Merry Christmas, Chris!
The book is awesome! but for a german kid (3 years old) just a little bit to hard ^^
Just in time!  Was looking for something for a kid… that book is clutch!
OK Ya, I have a simple, kinda Dorky question to ask but please guide me. We all know the Clear plastic covering the instruments and the radio, is very soft and easy to scratch. Even with many so-called Lens Cleaner Cloth made for the most expensive of cameras. Yet, this clear plastic will get scratched Real Quick. Please, share with us How you do it. (I have a New vehicle with a Ton of dust stuck right in my line of sight, waiting to be removed)(I don't dare spray anything that can Melt or Scratch this flimsy plastic) Please Advise.
i just purchased your book from amazon before you even finished talking about it. Good idea!
I definitely want the torque lug wrench and it’s 45% off too.
Bro! The kids book is so brilliant! Wow.
Chris,  i don't remember if i ever said this to you but i respect you very much,  the effort you put in for example this video is nothing short of stunning!  And above that you are genuine and pure.  Keep up the good work and have a amazing christmas.
Hey Chris fix does that reverse brake bleeder also help bleed your master cylinder better too??
Awesome ideas - Thanks, Chris!
I love the Santa Chris 🎄 🎅
Great video! Quick question I remember your video from last year with the race ramps for low profile cars, they are not currently available. Are there any other ramps you would recommend?
Merry Christmas Chris and comment section !
Should do breaker bar
Plz Chris I am here for TURBO KIT HONDA DELSOLO , plzz plzzz!!!!
I'll be purchasing a couple of your books for my little cousins who enjoy machines too! As well I like how you do a short demo on the tools! Great content as always
WTH dude, now I NEED all this stuff.  :)
I got a video idea how to take apart different power connectors on vehicles
Cooper understood the assignment
Book on how to use your turn signal please!
I love this so much chrisfix has made me very near cars now and I have everything that I know beacuase u and my my dad I love chrisfix:)
Chris I've waited years for the driftstang where is the update man
Great viedo  love all the tool gadgets  glad to see you have  your own  tool line up 😀
Best gift is moneh (fr)
Happy hanukkah from israel
Wow i dont need those wratchets but i want them If i do get them ill be buying that book and reversed brake bleeder You have help me alot with your videos and i think its time for us to help you out with purchasing that cool book thanks chris fix P.s. i need that book hand sign
10 out of 10 even though you don't need many of the tools its still very useful to see great products that maybe one day you'll need. Also the extendable ratchets 👍👌🤌
Hope you are doing well Mr.Fix
Book is a great idea, definitely going to pick one up for my son.
Bro literally wrote the book on changing a tire
When is theface revel
Just when I think you can't  get any better! You are soooo pure. I love your channel. I will definitely be buying your book. It will make an amazing birthday present for my son, he is 10 and has Aspergers. He will love this because he really loves cars! ❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊🤩🤩🤩
I love your videos 😊
Driftstangs been real quiet for a while  hmmm
Merry Christmas ChrisFix, Cooper and fellow YouTubers. That was EXCELLENT in every way! Kinda want it all...
The extendable ratchet set is unavailable
I'm buying several of those "Children's" book to give out to people. Some of which might just be in their 20's or 30's.
I am so sad I am bad luck
I might try those ratcheting flare nut wrench set, they look a far bit easier to use than the crowfoot flare nut wrench set that I normally use in those situations.
That book is great.  I'm going to gift it to a few friends (if Amazon lets me).  That aside, could you do a video on self-sealing tires?  It sounds like a can of Fix-A-Flat but better.  I went electric and my Bolt didn't include a spare tire, only a compressor and instructions.  I'd love to know more about what the heck I'm dealing with.  (Worst case, other Bolt owners tell me I can get a Cruze spare tire and stick that in the wheel well in place of the compressor, tow hook, and charger compartment.)
Hope you have a merry Christmas man!   Since I started watching you in 2020, you’ve saved me a buncha money and helped me enjoy fixing up my car!   Thanks for the tips, and keep up your amazing quality in your videos!
hohoho merry christmas
Drifting
Love your videos, I don't know if you've featured this before but I do have 1 addition I would make. Magnetic sockets, so under-rated but there are some situations where they are an absolute life saver! Especially with how tight the tolerances are getting in modern engine bays.
Where'd the Drift Stang go??
Loved the vid so many useful tools to buy!
His mom would be mad watching him tear the gift wraps
You (1/4 inch) 4:49 vs the guy she tells you not to worry about (1/2 inch) 4:38
Sir.why do you not making video about your 💚hummer ev💚 making reels in your insta only please make a video and review your experience in your youtube
man you forgot the "7th year: that's this year lol"
9.3m guys we are getting close to face reveal
Chris, I have been waiting for this video for so long. I wish youd do it earlier so people have time to get the gifts. But, I know youre busy.  Question, can I just use the reverse brake bleeder for bleeding brakes in general. Or must I bleed the brakes normally then use the reverse brake bleeder
whats with that helmet? always on !!!
🎥🐐🐐🇺🇸🚀🚀🦍🦍💎💎🙌🙌🙌💎💎💎🦍🚀🚀🇺🇸🇺🇸🐐🎥🎥🐐🇺🇸🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍💎💎🙌🙌
"its not about the money, it's about getting the younger generation into cars"  The realest quote.
I need to see that engine you posted on tiktok
Cooper is really great at unwrapping.
10 $  one book
I was literally gonna comment yesterday where is the 2022 video lol
Can't even hope to use the flare nut ratchet on my brakes lines. No room to fit the wrench head so huge.
1m 20 and I am buying this book it looks cool
Is that an engine on the back of the truck??🤔
Need more chrisfish after watching the knife sharpener segment
What a creative, funny, informative and very nice delivery. Cooper is a fantastic peer!!! I like and I need your tools. Thanks
None of this will arriveby Christmas, Chris.
I have the handheld Ryobi inflator and it's perfect for filling up my personal cars when I need it.
Does the camera work for colonoscopys?
This video is useful, fun, heart-warming, entertaining and  relaxing, all wrapped up in a ChrisFix unique type bow. Thanks, Chris ! Best wishes to you and your family!
I happened to buy a borescope camera and little did I know 1 month later I was moving cables around in my roof and I couldn’t find a cable and then I used the camera to help find it. Well worth the money!
Can't wait for international! I want to have those children books for my kids (If i manage to graduate and marry my gf in 3-5 years) later on
a bit late Chris...i already spent all the money :))
chris you r j an angle
I want ALL of this stuff!......evil Chris! I am trying NOT to spend money ;)
Your transparency and desire to give back to the next generation is an admirable quality. Merry Christmas, Chris 🫶
I can’t order on amazon 😢 gonna have to wait until on eBay 😂
You might wanna do these videos a little sooner so people have time to get the gifts lol
you forgot Hilti
Hi
This is one of your best Xmas vids.
Bruh chris be on fire
Chris…Fixmas
Cooper better get all the treats!
Just bought the book for my little one! Super excited for it.  Something creative, not like other channels.  Props to you Chris!
I can agree that the knife and tool sharpener works i have one myself and my pocket knives have never been sharper
Can you use a reverse brake bleeder to change the brake fluid? Just suck out resevoir, pump in, repeat? Start furthest away and work towards? Would make it a lot easier of a one person job.
Big fan, ordered your wonderful book immediately for my son who has 2 young boys❤ I’m converting a Sprinter into a  camper with solar and water. Always checking your channel to learm more! Thanks you for the knowledge!
This is not “gift ideas” these are necessary for me right now. Thanks chris
9.3+ Million Subscribers!!! WOW - I can remember when you had 2M when I used one of your videos to address an issue
Love these vids, I've been watching for a while. New account though. I appreciate it!
im getting the ratchets next check.. not even going to use them. going to put them up for display as a memory of a what a great person/mechanic you are!🙌🏻
new chris fix lore just dropped - he went to culinary school
Lowe’s also has a really good tire inflator, it’s compact and comes with a compartment for the included other attachments
Remember the time when Cooper just stole a stocking stuffer in 2020 or 2019 or something like that?
Chris can I get a sample of tools???
I’ve been waiting for this
Cool. Ty
Let’s goooooo
Chris, what happened to the Ford Crown Vic ( Project Police Intercepter)?
Chris I think you should try to make a drag car that actually make all the car people that like my cars parking lots really happy because I like cars and drag cars
I built the die that makes Leatherman multi-tools.
Amazing gifts ❤️
Lovely tools very useful
I have the Ryobi inflator.  That thing has paid for itself several times over.  It goes with me on all road trips now.  And it beats trying to find quarters at the gas station for their compressor that may or may not work.
Shouldve been santafix but nice
a turbo kit....  😢
I have the life one 9:52
You should blur the qr code
That Santa wink 😉 🎅🏻
That dog  got me laughing cute as ever
I love the ratchets, must get 1 set ASAP
Chris is one of the most consistent and hardworking YouTubers on the platform. He keeps it accessible for anyone of all skill levels and no matter what tools you have. Always positive, keep up the awesome work! I hope your book is very successful!
7th year of ChrisFix Xmas gift Ideas already? It feels like just yesterday it was the 1st. Keep up the great work, I still love every new video like the older ones
I waited for this for such a long time. Thanks for uploading for us Chris!
You will get first place with the soapy water racers
Where is the drift car with supercharger
At my house, there's a massive air compressor built into the foundation. I can hook up pneumatic tools in any room
SUPERCHARGE MUSTANG
Are you still alive Del Sol? Hope you get a turbo in 2023.
all of These are amazing tools for cars, but I've seen better, if not, the best tool. but there are some gifts here where it's already the best feature.
What's that Red Toyota?🤨
If I could give multiple likes, I absolutely would. Great video Chris.
Excellent and appropriate marketing and consumer education, Chris! It's good to see you leading your followers faithfully and within the area of your expertise . . . not trying to take advantage of your popularity with 9.5 million viewers.  All the best.
do you have a boat?
You can also just get a George (from the Henry Hoover lineup) it’s a shop vac with a wet vac built in, very powerful and under 300€
That book is awesome! You're amazing for trying to help kids get into the scene! Save the manuals!
GET THIS MAN BREAK-EVEN!!!!
At 24:45 I was like "TESLA? NO WAY!!!😲😲😲" then pops out as Teshlong I mean Teslong 😂🤣 Chris what you just did there 😅. I love the Ratcheting Flare Wrench, all this ratcheting wrench of modern days are amazing 😁👌.
another amazing video as usual and congrats on the book what an awesome idea !
all i want 😭cant buy
Hell my siblings don’t know how to change a tire and neither do some of my classmates the book should be targeted towards adults
Dude what your doing with that book is really good...we need more youtubers like you
You kinda gave away the qr code bro
Chris I hav a suggestion if you hit 10 mil subs pls male a face reveal video plssssss🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hey Chris! Fan from the other side of the Atlantic ocean here! Hope you soon include international shipping on the ratchets.
Great tools an ideas. However the reverse brake bleeder has a serious downside imo. When the brake bleed valve is higher up than the brakline connector, like in your example, the air will stay in the caliper. The brakefluid flows around the air but the air stays in place. I made a tool ike this myself for a motorcycle and i ran in this exact problem. The only way to get the air out is unbolt the caliper and hold it around with the brake line connection at the highest position which offcourse is a bit counterproductive. The tool is usable but keep in mind where the air could be trapped.
Huh. ChrisFix has the same kitchen knives I do. Neat.
You are a saint. Like honestly your videos and attitude give me confidence and motivation to work on my vehicles when I’m feeling lazy
coop's a goodboy, helping Papa Santa is just too cute
That lug wrench is actually sick.
CHRIStmas Fix here
💘💘💘💘👏👏👏👏
For anyone wondering if those telescopic ratchets are worth it, they definitely are. I have used and abused one for 4-5 years, but really, abusing it. I have undone crankshaft bolts with it, they are not designed for it, as it is better to get even more leverage (breaker bar), but they last a lot. Also have use it to torque cylinder heads. The brand is not really important, as it seems the manufacturer is the same taiwanese one, so as long as it looks like the one in the video, all good. They could come in satin or polished finish, but they are the same.
Yo Chris Fix I Have A Question Hopefully You Can Get Back To Me . I Have A Air Lift Suspension System In My 2003 bmw 330 ci . And i want to take it out and put the regular shocks or whatever in . What parts do i need for this ?
Chris - in your book, the first page you opened, there is an illustration showing to put your hand up, on the wheel. This is actually dangerous, never ever grab a wheel on car on top/bottom, always on sides. My friends father lost 3 fingers because he did exactly this, then the car jack failed and the car fell down, cutting his fingers because the wheel he was holding was loose.
God Jul och Gott Nytt År!☃🎅
I love the video!!
Thanks for the sterling content as always, Chris! Have a wonderful Christmas break!
Did he just creampied his jeep on the last one?
chrisfix please do a video on how to turbo charge a car
Love this Chris. Happy holidays to you and your family and think you for all the great vids and information over the year. Your the best man 👍👍🤗
I love you
Just got the book, even before watching the rest of the video. Really happy it is easily available on Amazon UK!
to show you that chrisfix is great i dont even celebrate christmas and i love these kinds of videos
Made in the F*** communist China???
Coopers the man.
That torque rench is so cool I’ve never seen that before
I love these videos because there are some tools/car accessories that I never knew existed! Can’t wait to buy these tools in the future so I could use these tools you recommended me!
Hope you have a happy holiday Chris
Chris that book is also handy to some adults that don't know how to change a tire
Love this always look forward to it every year, and hopefully more years to come 🙏
Always love these a Chris it’s always the point I get into the Christmas vibe. Thank you man ❤🎉🎉
God I love this. I look forward to this more than xmas itself! ;)
Reverse Brake Bleeder!! Maybe Cavity Wax for MR. 2
the best video every year :)
I totally have to get your book for my little one. Congratulations on being a published author.
Be me 25 ; getting the book to support how I can
9:50 nobody should ever buy these cheap shit portable shampoo contraptions. They use a shitty weak vacuum motor, and the extraction portion of the process is by far the most important. I own a detailing business, what I and every other professional worth a shit uses, is a small high power wet/dry vac. specifically i use the Rigid 4gal 5HP vac and it is absolutely amazing. You  get one of those hand pump weed sprayers to dispense water and put your shampoo in a spray bottle and then use a very stiff bristle brush either by hand or on a drill. There is no carpet shampoo appliance on the planet that can perform comparably
Congratulations on your book Chris it turned out well
Book idea: How to supercharge a 98 Mustang GT :D
Hey Chris have you made video on how to change rear drum brakes to disc brakes. Also happy holidays
LegitStreeCars could do with the small extendable ratchet everytime they fly out to buy a car and can't take any tools over a certain size.
I was scared, that this year there wouldn't be Christmas gift ideas, but i was wrong! Thank you, Chris!
Best gifts ever!! Thanks 🥳👍
NGL I cheated a little bit by using a screenshot of the book and scanned the qr code from that.
Anyone else wondering why theres a massive turbo motor in the back of this truck?
Love it when you release this one for the holidays🤙🏽
Cooper really is the MVP 😁😁
Chris when you gonna be uploading on chrisfish again 😢
Hey chris what's the bg music called?
Your alive??????
a gift to myself is a gift none the less, thanks papa chris
Ridgid also makes a pretty good tire inflator
Still rocking Teng tools and cart?
watching Santa work on a car is funny to me
ChrisFix you are a God .Thank you so much for all the content you produce for us and happy hanukkah
Will the reverse brake bleeder damage the seals in the master cylinder by pusbing back?
Do car reviews once you reach 10 m subs
Awesome Chris! Thanks, I've been waiting for this video. Maybe next year we can get a new video one week in advance. This one is cutting it close to Christmas
Chris, can’t remember if it’s been used in a previous year or not, but a small box survival kit could be an a awesome gift. I got one with all sorts of stuff like a blade, compass, fire starter, etc. Haven’t used it a lot but when I have it was super useful.
What I learned from this is that Chris sells high quality head
honestly at this point his neighbors probably didn't even bat an eyelid at him out in his driveway in a full santa costume.
So these wrenches are the LinusTechTips screwdriver of wrenches. Nice! I'm scared to ask whet these cost shipped to Europe :D
the torque lug wrench is a pretty cool idea; that said, I instead ordered ratchet sets both for my kid and for me :)
Oooooh yeah!!
Culinary school?? Where’s ChrisCooks?
Turbo driftstang!!!!
It’s a little last minute with this video. Ordering now it would be after Christmas
happy new year chrisfix! :)
The best tool is a cup of tea or a few beers.  Thanks for the vid!
im getting impatient for a video on the viper
Cooper is so cool 😎
cool tools! i have a ratchet that you spin the handle and spins 4 times the speed
a gift you can give to us is a supercharger mustang video
Who was waiting for this,I was
“So one of the first things I learned in culinary school is-“  Hold the hell on. You’re telling me that this dude is a chef, marine biologist AND a mechanic? Bruh how tf?
Really been waiting all year for this !
“If you’re using an lug wrench like this, it might be time to upgrade.” I did. That’s why I’ve got a 1/2 impact 😂    I’ve never been a fan of extendable ratchets for the reasons you stated. I just don’t trust em. That’s cool that you got your brand for sale. I just might pick up that kids book. They like helping me do work. Since you’ve already got changing oil coming up, I would recommend maybe changing disc brakes since they’re more common now and would be easier to write a kids book on. Hope your book does well, but I’m pretty confident you’ll be able to get the sales you need.
HI Chris Thank you for making funny videos every video I watch You will make me happy ❤
thanks you is not enough
Chriz, it's so sad 😭 to say that your products like extendable ratchets are not available in our country ‘India’.....🥺🥺.....can you try to make available in our country......
Ohhh boy!!
Hey Chris, have you still got the del sol? if so will you ever install the turbo kit you had from ebay for it? Thanks
He went to culinary school? Dream man
I have a similar multitool knife, file  knife, saw lockpick etc. But mine is has much lower quality lol  And tbf, its a dollarstore knife.
Can’t wait to get the m18 inflator, thanks for giving me some confidence that small thing can pump up a massive tire quickly. I just hate waiting in line at the gas station outside of the drag strip to air up before driving home😂
I've been waiting for this since January 1 2022 Anyone else??
Hej how are you  Why you download video wvery dag
Flex head version of the ratchets...?
10:19
Now how do I convince my partner my 2 year old needs that book 😂
I like to wax my ladies' frame rail at least three times a week. 😆 In all seriousness. It's good that you let folks know about this stuff. I do a ton of anymore electronics work for folks, so I know exactly what you see and deal with. Thank you for bettering society. Happy holidays. 🤙🏾
The book idea is so thoughtful because like you said it's not about the money and this book could really make a lot if kids Christmas great
as someone who is 18 and still learning about cars I like that you demonstrate what each tool or gadget does and the different prices for anyone's budget rather than other youtubers who would normally just use more expensive items that most people cant afford.   The book was also a wholesome thing to do cause like its something that would be useful and any kid that likes cars would be proud to learn something and tell there parents so its something educational and interesting for a kid to read since it has pictures and a story to it and then when they get older they could thank you for teaching you about cars.
Amazing 😍
I wonder how many ppl would have gone bankrupt if Chris was a salesman irl 😮‍💨
I want a Chrisfix jersey for Christmas next year
Chris is just Stig American Mechanic Cousin
I need one of everything
Driftstang
Best part of christmas
Honestly if you came out with a whole line of tools that would be very helpful. I would feel confident in any tool that you put out because I would know that you tested it thoroughly before you put your name on it. I do so much searching and review reading before buying tools and I wouldn't have to do that with your tools.
Basically this video is a video of these stuff's wish coming true
Going to be purchasing the extendable  ratchets! I really need some!!!! Perfect timing 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
For a split sec I was asking myself "Why is The Stig on a ChrisFix video?".
That random page put the biggest smile on my face. Proud of you chrisfix. I wish you all the success in the world.
Wish I knew about that cavity wax years ago. Living in Canada my 2010 is rusty as all heck, with regular cleaning/ paint protection during the year.
Hey Chris Fix I wanted to buy the Chrisfix extendable ratchet but seems it's unavailable. Will you have more coming soon. Please let me know as I really want to buy it 🙏
You are a real go-getter and so ambitious for a young guy Chris.  Your parents must be very proud of you.
Dude that book is so legit
Ordered the book! Great video! Always look forward to seeing the new gadgets you recommend!
I thought the tire iron torque wrench was a little goofy but everything else is decent
One of new favorite Christmas traditions!
Any other knife guys cringe 😖 when they saw that knife shredder?
30 minutes? it will go like 10 minutes
Yeoooooooo that's such a smart idea to sell your own tools....your own brand. I want it!
Chris, what's the engine for?
i was so surprised to hear you went to culinary school, you truly are a jack of all trades
"Slowly pullout, so ya can see how it sprays" lol
the gift is so cool! I will give it to myself
You the best. That's a great idea having a qr code that is a link to a video of you reading it.
i want a face reveal for christmas
Extremely very super common Chrisfix W
I did have a question on the extendable rachets. Don't your old ones got high mileage on them or did they have all that free play from day 1?
That book may be made for children, but it’s looks really good and I want it.
every christmas video i hope that chris does a face reveal as one of the presents… been 5 years….
I like all your product.
Did anyone notice the engine in the bed of his truck? Lol
Would you recommend using rust converter first before using cavity wax -- if we have no tools/skills to remove the actual rust?
happy holidays guys keep it up. more blessing to come ChrisFix
Oh no. Chris fix filled his truck up with presents to talk to them holding a camera
I got the Ryobi inflator and anyone wondering what the hose was on the left - its for air mattresses and the like. Also has bits for inflatng sports balls and so on. Goes on sale for like $20 often and a must if you have other Ryobi tools/batteries
Whats on the hummer
What's your next video
Hmmmm I was trained to never push old brake fluid back up the system as you could clog the ABS accumulator.
The only problem I have with extractor vacuum is that the one I have can’t quite get all the water out of the carpet after it’s sprayed and so I’m worried the moisture will sit and end up creating mold
Not all superheroes wear capes , some wear racing helmets !
Nice video! One question, have you stopped using Vegas Pro Editor? Or you still continue to use that one?
I’m just wait for a new driftstang video 😢
So it seems that the mysterious Chris Fix is actually the Stig from the TV show Top Gear!😎
Hi
Wow it’s been 6 years?!?! Time flies
Hi Mr Chris, thanks for the great video. Can you make a video showing why car brakes is squeaking and how to repair it? Thanks Mr Chrisfix
You can make the extending ratchets better by having a swivel head on them.
JUST as you said "You might be wondering how to get the ratchet flare wrench off" I was watching and thinking it.... Perfect timing LOL
You could have posted this A week ago so that I got To change my wishlist on my Christmas Party 😭😭😭
fuuuuuuuu i wish i had known about the cavity wax when i got my power rack for weightlifting in the back yard, it's covered but the inside of the frames are getting rust and i simply didn't know how to deal with it effectively
This is No a hate question just curious Why is he still hiding his face? There have been multiple times where his face is visible. But anyways happy early Christmas to everyone.
Bro next video on nos cylinder and turbo charger installation pls
Would cavity wax work well for a rotting-out rocker panel? Awesome vid
رائع جدا كم كنت أنتظر هذا بارك الله فيك
7:07 yeah yeah we know
I just ordered your book for my son.
Hi Santa Claus Chrisfix 🧑‍🎄 🎅
What 8-10 year olds can't read?
ChrisFix is really the realest for the kids book and the ratchets
Hey Chrisfix, it's only you that got me into a car mechanic career and I couldn't be happier so thank you Chris I'm glad that you got recommended in the past years
I'm sorry, CULINARY SCHOOL? 😯
I need those extendable ratchets. For next year I would like to see a video regarding the ignition coils. When to change them? How to know they're going bad
Hello,Christfix : first of all I want to say merry Christmas to you and your family .Second, I ask you to provide a video clip about Toyota Camry2006 brakes why does not work its brake frimly and why it does not move fast at trafic light when you press acceliter. Thanks
These tools are doing wonders for my mid-life crisis.
Not a sponsored video then processes to show his own product.
Question for 2023:  Does Chrisfix fear Project Farm?
ChrisFix will soon be more larger than the harry potter book franchise:Dd
I love that Senta wear helmet and working gloves. 🤣
Face reveal petition.
Damn man I cant appreciate enough all the hard work Chris puts in💯💯
My guy you gotta drop these vids sooner
"None of these items are sponsored" *sponsors self* well played sir.
I've been waiting for this video for an entire year 😅  Advance Merry Christmas and Advanced Happy New Year Chris! 🎄❤️
I love coopers chaotic energy
I'm 13 with a mind on cars and fixing them thanks Chris for teaching me how to do a lot of things so I can fix my dream car up.
I almost thought we weren't going to get this year's video. I'm always looking forward to this one. Thank you Chris. Keep up the good work you do in life & stay blessed brother 💯 Have a Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year with your loved ones!
I love my Makita tire inflator
Chris don't forget to put out how to change your muffler bearings and how to add blinker fluid to your book lineup. I'm sure the kids will get a good laugh.
From a quality engineering standpoint, the ratchet was made beautifuly.
Bro was like let's give people 9 days to buy presents. Video should have been released at least a week ago
Cooper is such a good dog
Chrisfix never disappoints! I already got the book, most likely going to snatch that ratchet set! 😉
Always look forward to these videos. Release it a couple weeks earlier to allow time for it to arrive before Christmas if ordering online. We know these things will go out of stock all because of this video.🤣
The m18 is cheaper than the smaller m12 tire inflator lol
The fact you made a children's book is honestly wholesome, It's very thoughtful for you to make something like this for the kids. I think I will buy this for my nephew when I have the money, I think he would love it. :) He's really little, but he loves cars, and I think this would be a great thing for him to learn about. When he grows up, this book might kick start something for him!
Chrisfix, will your stuff be available even after the Christmas?  I don’t have the money for the extension ratchet quite yet
Book is out of stock already, wow congrats bro. I'll wait for the next batch to get one.
Cooper is a great addition to the video!
The reverse bleader looks neat. As with the torque lug nuter...
That book is a genius idea Chris.. I'll definitely be picking that up for my son this Christmas. Keep up the great work I've loved each video you've uploaded since day one.. I believe you're the number one reason I'm so into vehicles today. It's insane how far you've come the past couple years I've been watching you.
Great video!
yay! affiliate links!
This man took the time to go through each tool and not just talk about them. You're an honorable man, Chris. Have a great holiday.
Just out of curiosity, as I'm in school right now, we were informed never to bleed brakes from the caliper to ensure we dont damage the ABS. just wondering if this is a problem?
I’ve been waiting!!!!!
Holy cow those wrenches are expensive
Need to get me some new toys 🤩
hi chris merry christmas i want to knw if you could work on a 1999 suzuki swift since you take care of so many cars so please find one on autotempest
I don’t know he went to culinary school
we need a parts of a car book it would be so good
I got that reverse bleeder….man, it is a game changer. 100#
أنا أشاهدك من سورية لك كل الاحترام وشكرا
Chrisfix ratchets already unavailable!  That was fast.
I've been here since the first one of these Christmas videos 7 years ago, it's crazy it's been that long. My first car was an SN95 mustang, because of your driftstang videos, they helped me so much in figuring out how to fix it  I'm working as a mechanic in a dealership currently, you inspired me to pursue that as a career, and I bought your ratchets to use, so I'll be torture testing thems for you, and I'll be interested to see how they do.
Not sure how I feel about the reverse brake bleeder....you say it works great but it doesnt make sense to me.  You're working against gravity, and trying to bleed the air out by pushing fluid from the top of the caliper.  It seems to me like you're never going to get all of the air out of the caliper that way, and in trying to, you're potentially pushing air into the lines.
I will probably end up getting the extendable ratchets this holiday season, always just want a reliable product and I believe yours is
The book idea was fuckin awesome bub
use a forever sharp
Yo Chris how you been?
Book idea how to do a LS swap
Homie is rocking the ASICS. That’s how you know he’s true to his words
Immediately ordered your book for my son and a suggestion would be how to change your spark plugs.
good job Cooper!
You can bet your ass I got a book for my son!
I really been watching you for 6 years now 😮
Great ideas. Love this video every tool you showed I need and i dint know I needed before watching. 👍
Culinary school????
Anxiously awaited this video!!! Checked everyday and was thrilled when it came up
Chris you said you will be releasing a how to turbo charge your car video???
What a toilet man
I can personally attest to the vacuum extractor. The Bissell green machine is awesome!  Same thing for the Work knife sharpener. Works great and very versatile.
As someone who has the set of ratchets (Chris already knows) I can confirm they are very amazing quality and 100% worth the money
Can you do a preventive measure / maintenance video like using cavity wax for expensive cars like range rovers (latest models)?
Awesome as always. Thanks for “showing us”!
96,007th!
All jokes aside I want a Chris fix certified technician diploma to frame on my wall. I’d be so fucking proud
I have two daughters, 19 & 14, and as a mom it'll make me feel more at ease knowing that they can change a tire!  I just ordered two books lol. Thank you Chris for your knowledge, helpful tips, and warm heart! Merry Christmas to you! 🎅🎄⛄
Can't believe you didn't go with "chrisfixmas"
11:56 do you recommend Spotless over Bissell? You more so focused the camera on it and pointed at it more than the Bissell.
I mean it's all in Yank. Wtf is 19/32 in a measurement system not designed by neanderthals?
Loved your podcast and showing your passion into cars. Looking for 2023 anticipated videos Chris! Stay safe and healthy.
An idea for a book is how to change the brakes since you have the how to change a flat tire
Cooper had a great day! Haha he enjoyed this more than anyone else I bet
Yesterday... My dad asked me what I want for christmas... I had no idea. Your Christmas ideas saved me man! I gave him 10 items I want hahaha
Where are the videos on the drift stang
Dude. Christmas is like 10 days away... you sure didn't give us much time to buy these things in time for the big day
28:38    I should call her
Just picked up the Milwaukee inflator today – before I saw this video
Ur book looks great!
Just bought three copies! One for my boy, another for a cousin and a third to donate. Hope to see more high quality tools as well to possibly purchase in the future.
Honestly I think a lot of mechanics would use (3:26) a crow foot wrench set rather than open ended wrenches of any type.  It's only slightly better though.
you're one of the best car youtubers out there. you actually show step by step how to do things with cars. I love your videos Thank you.
Best birthday gift ever!!! Thank you ChrisFix
I'm gonna order a couple of your books.  Is Amazon the only option?  Is there another way to buy it that sends a little more money your way?
Gotta do a Cooper video cuz he damn cute. Pets make for good content and brings in more subs
I’m waaaaay over 9 and I will buy your book Chris!  Thank you for a fun video as always!!
chrisFix my respect towards you man, so unique and cheerful. I could always tell your so passionate towards your career and us the audients. we don't know how much it takes you to get those camera angels but you always on point never waste time and entertaining asf something that is hard to achieve. your the man bro
Next book for ages 15-18; LS Swapping for dummies
This video just explained why my carpet cleaner has a small nozzle attachment. Will definitely use it after winter. Thanks Chris
Kobalt tire pump is $45
Great video but same as last year i think the most underrrated item you are missing is a mini battery jump box, too many people still use jumper cables! Most are $90-160 and charge devices, have a flashlight ect, and jumpstart the car.
Mom!!!! The neighbor is talking alone in the yad again and is dresses as Santa!!!  Get back in son, don't go near him.
I love the Free P4! You can flick it open and I love the one handed use on them. Great video Chris!
Wait all year for this video. Thanks so much for everything you do. May you and yours have a Merry Christmas and an amazing 2023 !
YOO I LOVE IT!!!
Jesus loves you’
I have two children (now adults) and started teaching them how drive when they were 13 / 14 on back / logging roads.  I simply wanted them to learn the basic functions of operating a vehicle.  I also included teaching them in an empty parking lot on Sundays how to drive in snow.  Both have remained great drivers (sans one of them driving 90+ on a back road and getting stopped by the state police).  Gave that child advice on “throwing themselves on the mercy of the court” in person ... they chose not to ... a year later they went and bought a high performance car, THEN checked out insurance ... they ended up paying a huge premium because of the reckless driving citation.  Lessons NOT learned from their parent!!! 😝😝😝
Looking forward to the next fishing  season with your cousin ChrisFish
I can't believe one video made me so happy!!   I've been waiting for this the whole year!  Thank you Chris!
Love that you wrote a book my man!
Love to imagine his neighbors watching a Santa run around a festive driveway
Chrisfix is one of the few channels where I always like the videos
when will poor Cooper get its toy? thanks for the videos and happy holidays!
Bro I guess you are the first person in the world without any hate .
Ironically I actually bought the EXACT steam cleaner and a step down from the extractor vaccume this year 😂  HIGHLY recommend both
I'm gonna save up 100%  for a Carpet extractor for my sister she needs it :)
Your ratchet idea is so awesome. I love that it’s quality and not some rebranded turd.
you are so professional, your videos are clear, straight to the point, and have some really nice information, before knowing your channel I got scammed by the local mechanic, you gave me courage to work on my 2007 VW Jetta, and it's running better than ever and I feel so accomplished working on it, Merry Xmas and great gift ideas!!.   Thanks for putting so much effort into your videos.
Just ordered the kids book ! Can’t wait to read it with the kiddos!
Thanks Chris!
Can that toque wrench be used for things other than wheels?
Let's get Chris fix to 10 million subscribers 🙂😀
I believe that "pick with a hole in it" on the Leatherman is called an "awl", and it's meant for leather work.
Bruh, changing a tire is so EZ
Hey guys, thankful for Chris fix this year. How about you!
I hope I can get those gadget when I get older
I want a full video on your tool box tour. Plz cover all of your tools. Fan from India 🇮🇳.
The only Santa's lap I'd want to sit on 😎
Amazing job as always, super helpful and informative. We appreciate you ChrisFix.
Nice work congrats on your book and great tool ideas (anyone else wonder what the engine in his truck goes in?)
I've been watching all your videos since day one keep up the videos
Ever care to do nurburgring? By the way thanks for replying to everyone. We appreciate you chris
Everyone go buy the book
Can't believe it's time already!
You forgot about the 18V cordless hammer and the electric garden hose extension cord! LOL
Guess ill be gettin my daughter the chris fix book
When are u doing that video of u supercharging your mustang
Yooooooo Chris buddy, another awesome video
Extended ratchets are worth. Definitely going to get a set!
so am i the only one who caught this casual drop of going to culinary school?  So my man  Fixes cars Races cars Fixes boats published author launches own tool line marine biologist and now chef?
The second you said you had a book I went and bought it! I cannot wait and I only have a 10 month old 🤘🏼
We know what you look like.  You don't have to dress up like The Stig.
Is DaT a TuBoR😳
Ordered the book for my 8 year old, he will love it.  Was that a little inline diesel in your truck?
Would appreciate pricing in video.::
Straight from the children’s book to commenting.  Dude. This is what sets you apart from others. Such sincerity my friend. Thank you.
The best gift you could ever give to someone is a bottle of soapy wooder
8:11 I was hoping for Cooper to steal it😅. The hours and wrapping you took takes alot of time even when editing a simple video.
U don’t think I could build a log cabin with a multi tool saw Chris? Is that a challenge?
I love speed bleeders!  So easy and work awesome.  One person brake bleeding.
Im on vacation so i can't really watch
Your leverage example is junk.
if you have to inflate multiple tires to high pressures you want the milwaukee m18 inflator over the milwaukee m12 as it can get too hot and stop working.
We need a Christmas in July too gadgets next year
“Honey, he’s talking the presents again”
Chris fix was the person who inspired me I’m going to start my own mechanic service and make it be like two times cheaper than normal but yes not true it’s not about the money it’s about teaching people how to fix their cars with common handles in the driveway and anyone can do it you just have to try hard and if you put your mind into it and you can make it work out Kristen inspired me and I’m only eight years old 27:36
Dude it's awesome that you have your own tools now and a freaking kids book! How cool. Love these gift videos and always come away with a few new purchases. Thanks for doing what you do and happy holidays!
Most of the stuff on here is like £100 an up thats mad
You fix and maintain vehicles, published a children's book, and attended culinary school (nice knife handling technique).  How I wish you were my neighbor.     Merry Christmas, Chris!!🌲
Chris, you NEVER fail to impress! Even for seasoned mechanics, these are great! Surprised you didn’t do a head flashlight, but very innovative ideas!
Awesome bro!
So my 2011 Ford Ranger is showing signs of a bad spark plug or more. The gas mileage is pretty bad (2.3 L 4 cyl). Also, some days it has a little bit of trouble cranking. It’ll turn over for a few seconds before it cranks. Idle is a little rough as well.   My issue is that the wires for the plugs are jammed between the oil cap and the top of the engine. I can’t seem to get them to pull off the spark plugs. I’m wondering if I’m not doing something right. Should they just pull off or do I need to twist them? I don’t want to damage anything
Nice video as always Chris 👍 Love the tools !
700k away from 10Mil subscribers!! Amazing work 👏 🙌
I say when you hit 10 million subs we see the legend the myth.
best video of the whole year fr
That intro was awesome.  I always enjoy your enthusiasm and energy in the content.  The neighbors probably heard you recording that and thought "oh its that time of year again!"
1:40 dude you just too good of a guy mann
"how cold it is outside" meanwhile there is green grass in the background.....YUP SO COLD! +10c is REALLY COLD
Merry Christmass Chris!
Well, looks like I know what I'm getting myself for Christmas!  I've always appreciated your content, and if you're putting your name on tools I trust it! I don't have any extendable ratchets yet, but now they're on order. Thanks for the video ChrisFix!
Wow, I really like the reverse brake bleeder!
Hey ChrisFix, since you always tell us to wash down our surfaces you should do a review on a pressure washer foam attachment that shoots out soapy water.
Love Your Videos Chris, you've really taught me a lot about auto repair through your videos and I'm definitely gonna be ordering The Extendable Ratchet Set. And The Lug Torque Wrench. Keep up the hard work and Merry Christmas And Happy New Year
The book is gonna break the bank when the little dweebs start asking for their helmets.
7 years??  Say it isn't so. Seems like it can't be more than 2.
Ma dood, when we saw the children's book, both my fiance and I both agreed that is such an awesome thing to do, and even though they are for children, we will be buying one for the shelf for sure! The QR code idea really warmed our hearts, and you never cease to amaze us! Keep up the great content Chris! I look forward to more work on that Del Sol!
Is there anything this man can’t do? Culinary school? Shark hunting? Mechanics? UPHOLSTERY?!
I wonder if Linus Sebastian would consider selling the extendable ratchets on lttstore. he already sells the Jerryrig Everything knife there.
Good job Chris
Bro!!! The kids book is an amazingly awesome idea!!! I’m definitely going to get it for my kids!! That’s so cool man!
30:10 Leatherman Free P4
Just ordered the book for my 4 year old son who is obsessed with tools and cars.
Cooper is a paid actor. Such a good boy 🐕!
Merry Christmas Chris
Amazing video like always Chris. I love how you put a lot of effort into your videos. Especially when technology wasn’t on your side this past days. 😊
We gonna ignore the engine?
I received my new Chris Fix extendable ratchet set last week and they are perfect. They look fantastic and work perfectly as Chis has demonstrated. I am so happy that I bought a set. Awesome  tools thank you Chris fix
Also how old is cooper
17:51 i think i speak for a lot of people when i say i began fixing my own cars because of the sound of a torque wrench. so damn satisfying 😍
The way Chris uses his hand gestures is oddly satisfying  also any tools with your name on it is a fosho deal. no need to try to convince us.
Is Cooper a stocking stuffer 😅
What is the accuracy of the inflators as I’ve heard they are inaccurate
Stocking stuffers??? I’m shopping for myself. 😂
Why I am not 8 to 10 years old 😭
If I ever do have kids, I’ll make sure to give them the book.
Havent even finished watching this one yet and already excited for the next one😂 waiting the whole year for these! love you chris!
Merry Christmas Chris🎉
Great gifts
Chris, you are amazing. Happy holidays my friend!
852nd
Can't only be me which wants a Chris fix book, even so I'm an adult 🤣🤣.
Finally! the 2022 Christmas gift idea!!!!!
THE BOOK! not even just for kids i need it too lmao idk how to change a tire 😂
The jacks on that body…. 😭😭😭
SANTA CHRISSSSSS i needed this now lmao
Just ordered your book man, my wife and I are expecting even though it’ll be a while, that’ll be one of the first books I read to my little boy or girl. At $10, that’s least we can do for All the time and effort you put into content for us, so than you Chris!
7TH YEAR ?!?! I Remember the first one back in High School
Heck yeah, been waiting since last year!!! Also, can I buy 2 books and get one signed? The other will go in my Little Free Library 😅😂
This list is extremely well thought out! All extremely useful tools, even for people who have been wrenching for a long time and have a large collection already. That bolt gauge is awesome!
I’m 15and ngl I’d read your Book and day
I have the older model of the ryobi tire inflator. Ive had it for 5 years and the s.o.b still works great. Fast. And the battery last quite a while. Its saved myself and others in the side of the road many times. And ive used to to pump up sleeping pads. Bikes. Balls. Etc
Waiting for this video has become a Christmas tradition 😂
I’m a big fan Chris fix! I won’t to be like you when I get older!
Love the new tools!! We should come up with a ChrisFix ShinePro 2 in 1 😁😃
Not sponsored? You're selling things with your own name and logo on😂
i dont gave kids but the book is awesome dude i love to see the younger generations not afraid to to put there hands on and this is a great influence
Thats the power of editing
Really love that Lug torque wrench. The extendable ratchet drivers are a great idea too. And the reversible brake bleeder. Going to share this vid w/all friends & family. Thanks Chris Fix!
AMAZING VIDEO!!! YOU MADE MY DAY!
Chris really thinks he can slide by without us catching the fact he went to culinary school in addition to being an amazing car mechanic!
I always wonder what the neighbours think, or if their thoughts have changed over the last decade 🤣
Love it...
Great video!
Hi Chris, this video needs to come out about six weeks earlier, I already got all my gifts under the tree
I'm 35 and I'll still buy that book since it's a Chrisfix special item.
1:29 I can’t help but scan the code right away, and luckily ChrisFix didn’t put a Rickroll out there lol
28:38 I should call her...
Great tools and great video Thanks
The book idea is a really great innovative decision you’ve made. Well done man!
wI'd say craftsman tire inflator due to it runs on 120V, 12V and 18V tool battery. It will take forever and is off by about 2 PSI.
Thanks for this! I'm definitely looking for an carpet cleaner/extractor, which is the one you recommend?
Your the man
I have $30,000 worth of tools and I still watch this every year 😂😂
My kids will be reading that book in 10 years
@ChrisFix I watched the entire video and I’m amazed at how far you’ve come and that we’ve been following you for seven years! Here’s to another seven years ChrisFix! Keep doing what you’re doing. Congratulations on your first book for kids too!
Children's book? Sold.
20:25 or hear me out u could use it as a belt sander
Watching this while changing my oil pan gasket
Can't wait for the Supercharged Mustang and especially the Turbo Del Sol Vids!
That reverse brake bleeder is THE SHIT!
Some wicked things on that list, I’m in uk so hopefully able to find like for like items, have a great Christmas mate, thanks for all your content over the years on everything from coolant flush to super clean engine bay etc, been a subscriber for Atleast 5 years now your a legend in my eyes mate! Thankyou again from the United Kingdom x
"Hey Guyyys!" And the day is ten times better! :D
Hate to say it sir but you can scan the qr code and watch the video from this video. Not sure if you want to blur it or not. Books has been ordered though
Aw Chris the audio 📖 nice how to change a tire
Me
The best Christmas gift you can give us is to show us your face. You did give us  almost everything except that!  Who agrees with me?
ChrisFix: "You're not gonna build a log cabin with it" TA Outdoors: *i beg your pardon*
Love the video!!!
Reaction to the first gift? Holy shit were coming out swinging today
I LOVE that you did a children’s book.  I love what you do, keep it up!!
🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬,
How to jump start a dead battery, how to change your oil, replace wiper blades, replace fuses,  etc the list could go on and on, but I think alot of adults need these books not just kids.😀
I was supposed to shop for my wife and son, but I'm gonna have to buy a couple of these for myself.
Ready for April 1st now 😂
Men I wish I have some of these tools but I don’t have the money bc of college
Dad Chris we need a fishing video! Merry Christmas!
I’m buying the book just because I support what you do 🎉
I was wondering when this was coming
Love the vid! BTW are we just gonna ignore that massive crate engine with a fat turbo in the bed of his mazda?😂
CHRISMAS FINALLY CAMEE LETS GOO
Highly do not recommend reverse bleeding brakes. If you have any amount of contaminants in your fluid, forcing back up past the ABS and the master cylinder is a fast way to destroy seals and valves
The ChrisFix Christmas special has turned into one of my favourite things about this time of year.
I have the Ridgid inflator and it's great, super compact. I keep it in my car with me.
I wanna know if the chrisfix extendable ratchet set is made in America or made in China??  Also: CULINARY SCHOOL!? You gotta tell us that story, please!
Worder is just the best.
I recommend SOG B63N-CP PowerLock EOD Multitool. Turn your man or woman into an EOD 😅  Mission-Ready😘😎😋🤤 Purpose-Built
Awesome gift ideas. I need that bore scope to find the socket I dropped somewhere on my truck. lol Thanks for the video and Merry Christmas
Cool stuff Chris, I always enjoy this annual video!
That multi tool is an amazing gift but unfortunately it’s like almost $200 I’m not made of money here
Hey Chrisfix! Nice of you for trying to get younger generations into cars. Thank you for your hard work to make us all happy for holidays! Hope you have a great Christmas, and a Happy New year!
Nice vid!
Shoutout to chrisfix for starting his own products 🙏
Well, I don't know if you know,  but here in Puerto Rico we celebrate Christmas ( December 25) and 3 kings day(Dia de Los tres relles magos) (7 of January)  so, I'm going to ask for some of those gift that you show 🤣🤣
All of these gifts are ridiculously expensive…
Soapy woodor
You're a good dude Chris. Makes me happy to see good people be successful.
Such a legend Chris. We all really love these Christmas vids of yours - so many great gifts and for us! Congrats on the book mate, what an excellent thing to do. And I love the little ChrisFix in the illustrations. Merry Christmas mate, cheers.
I've been waiting for this video, so excited to see it!!! I love all of these ideas! The rachet set is so cool, I really want to get those! I hope they will be available for a long time! Have a very merry Christmas, my favorite Youtuber, and a happy New Year!!!
Everything he showed is literally ALL made in china.
But I'm poor 🤨
Very useful. Would love to know country of origin of manufacture.
Was disappointed to find that the extendable ratchet set can not be shipped to Finland!
That brake beeder will help a lot, getting it 100%
Thank you and Merry CHRIStmas!! See what I did there with your name? 🤣🎄🌲🎁
Cooper Is a cute dog
We had a sewer backup at the house and raw sewage got to a carpeted room. We used an extractor vacuum (a few times) but after a day or so the smell was gone.
Happy Festivus. For the rest of us.
It only been 2 hours and the ratchets are sold out…. I Need em 😭
Cooper is the second fixer 😃
For the steamer, if you live in an area that has hard water, either city or from a your own well, then using distilled water will extend the steamer's service life.
We wish you a Merry Chrisfixmas, we wish you a Merry Christfixmas so here's some sweet new gear!
Are we just going to ignore Chris saying "one of the first things I learned in culinary school"?
The ryobi one also works for inflating mattresses during the holidays when family comes over. It is loud though so use it before anyone falls asleep
Awesome list, now I have more stuff to add to my wishlist, haha. That leathermen is a no brainer, I have a Free P2 myself and I use it almost everyday. From using it in residential electrical like installing outlets and circuit breakers to getting lawn equipment and some car work done in a pinch, it has saved my butt many times. Would defintely upgrade to the Free P4 if I had the money to blow in a hearbeat, I was in a situation today where that wood saw would've been real handy.
I love these. Keep it up Chris!
top 3 favorite car related channels   LOVED the lemons run take 2   merry christmas and ty for your content, you're a household name to us
This year was cool but I feel like it could be better.
Merry Chris-mas 🚘
I know certain people who would keep Chris's book in their car in case if they get a flat tire.
I buying now Chris could you please sign it for me if they are shipped from you? It will be this name under the order. I can give you my Amazon order number if you would like or somehow another way to show you where it's coming and who ordered it
Always one of my favorite videos! I have a suggestion though Chris… for next year, you should try to release this video sooner. Dont get me wrong, ur videos are ALWAYS top notch! But releasing the video more than a week before christmas might make it even more helpful!
Been here since the early Chris days where he didn’t have no where near the enthusiasm in his voice but the videos where always pumped full of useful information. Awesome to see this channel and him grow. Merry Christmas Chris and everyone else!!
I have the DEWALT 20V (DCC020IB)
But I’m in china so I can’t buy it😢
Hi
Hey Chrisfix I like the rims on your truck can you tell me what brand they are? Kind want those for my truck 😏
Great video! I was wondering. In one of your videos (can't remember which) you showed you were planning on a turbo kit install on the Honda Del Dol, is that idea still up? Would love to see you install a turbo, especially after I learned it's much more complicated than just throwing it in the engine bay...
Merry CHRISTmas!
Amazing video as always! Thank you for all the hard work you put into every single video you make. I might not have a car, but I'm learning a lot of things I'll have to know when I do get one and I think it's great that I'm able to watch your videos and get that knowledge (since 2016!). Happy holidays!
Finally. Couldn't wait for this. The GOAT.
Bought your book Chris! 🇨🇦
I honestly like the bore scope cameras that connect to phones. Easy and cheaper.
i need chris fish videos in my life
Future chrisfix branded product ideas: Torque Wrench, Small toolbox, screwdriver or set of them, padded gloves, socket set, work light, magnetic tray, magnetic pickup tool, racing helmet sock
this is an infomercial but so much better and actually fun to watch  10/10
What it's a coarse or fine ?
The Makita 18V inflator is amazing and very very quiet. Get that one.
I'm gonna buy that book, cause when i grow up i want to be a Mechanic just like you!
Does wax resist water,  and what about rust converter?
I just turned 27 this year. And I can't wait to get my book
Just out of curiosity, do your neighbors look at you like a weirdo? Always recording in your driveway, yknow how some folks be.
Helped a lot Chris thanks
Funny I was also in culinary school and now I go to Brookdale taking automotive 😂
Chris, maybe I've gone completely, but I remember that you did a face reveal at least 2 years ago. Did you do it or am I losing my mind?
OMFG, that children's book is too frigging cute!! Great video, Chris. Happy holidays to you!!
Here I am 22 years old wanting to buy that book for myself
With no doubt this is the most iconic series
I never would’ve guessed you went to culinary school!
Hi
Who else is gonna buy this book even though they’re an adult? 😂😂
This video is a christmas gift in itself, great work Chris, keep on fixing!
you posted the qr code for everyone 🙄
Yo you got to bler out that QR code you can scan it through the video
If I can make a recommendation, when you use a extractor vacuum on the carpet of your car or car mats, use a drill brush and a separate container of your soap and only put water in the vacuum. You’re going to get results like you just brought it home from a professional detailer. That’s what I do for my customers and it’s never failed me, even down to stains that have remained there for years.
I have been watching for 3 years now and i really enjoy fixing my car!😊 please give me a shout out
Congratulations on your extendable ratchets. Next up.... ratcheting wrenches or even a socket set lol
I dont even have kids and i’m going to get the book
Im going that reverse brake bleeder for my self
Dude the book was such a big brain idea! Been watching for years man you've taught me a lot. And i've been waiting for this video in particular because my parents keep asking me what I want for Christmas and I have no idea what to tell them 🤷‍♂
I hope you sell 100,000 books and buy a cool new car to wrench on
As a ratchet collector I’m super excited to get my favorite YouTubers branded ratchets 😆
Anyone else make their partner watch Chris to see if they’re the one? Forget Netflix and chill, I’m trynna Chris fix and and build😎
im new to this channel , did chris ever showed his face?
Ratchet is out of stock already😢
I love that u made a book
Not impressed with how much self promotion there is in this video. You selling out so you can build more shitty racecars?
23:34. Mine has one big box of many different bolts and nuts💀 I definitely need this one so they are all sorted. And to be honest, I hate searching a bolt or nut for so long just to replace a missing bolt or nut to the car. Especially if I don't know the exact size.
GOD I LOVE CHRISFIX
Happy Holidays ChrisFix! Whenever folks ask me what I want for Christmas or my birthday I don't normally know what I want or I forget it. This definitely helps with seeing what I could use. Lookin forward to another year of awesome ChrisFix and ChrisFish content. Your one of my motivators that keep me workin on my project vehicle. Have a Merry Christmas Y'all!
If you don’t want to get some like this always plan ahead and get summer air and winter.
1:45 I’m already into cars
2 sec ago saw your short with you working on new video. Open your channel and see this video posted 1 hour ago. Cool!
Regarding the decible levels for the tire inflators, keep in mind that 10db is actually a percieved DOUBLING of volume because it is a logarithmic scale!
You should’ve had seat covers in there
Those thread gauges pair really well with a tap and die set, in case you have to clean up the threads a bit.
Merry almost christmas
it may be the brand or whatever, but it looks like when you were attempting to break the lug nut loose, the first one had the lever in the up position which would mean you were tightening it, but the second, using yours, it was in the down position and removed easily..   Difference in brand and switch mechanism?
bruh maybe dont show the qr code
Is there any chance in getting the ratchets separately?
need a book on how to remove a transmission 😂
Hey Chris i was changing the breaks on my truck and someone was playing around in my truck hit the breaks and the break piston came out the caliper is it possible to get that back in without draining the break fluid
I ALWAYS thought Chris did post commentary. Never new it was live. That audio quality is insane
That book is adorable! I think you should do one on how the engine works and very basic electricity.
I use the m18 Milwaukee inflator for my track days. Really is a great tool and the quietness is impressive. I also feel like it has a less annoying sound than the others even though its technically louder.
That reverse brake bleederis awesome.  Also that Bissell spot clean pro is cool, A pro car detailer I watch on YouTube Used one for years.  He finally got a pro unit just because it had a bigger collection tank. A❤ would be awesome
Where can I buy Cooper though?
Oh my God I need that reverse brake bleeder
Me🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Omg finally Chrisfix uploaded thanks for video im so grateful you helped me a lot thanks again
It thought it was a tesla at 24:53😂
Love it. Love the book, hope you sell millions of copies.
Chris Fix is the best!
I do like my M12 tire inflator The knife sharpener works really well  I would recommend a Articulating Borescope.
benn waiting for this video for so long, great ideas
What a great idea with the book. If I had kids I'd buy it!
You've come a long way bro. Congrats on you're other ventures.
Yeah, Christmas comes with Chrisfix again 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
MERRY CHRISTMAS SIR 🤓🇺🇸👍
What kind of dog is cooper? I need to know!
Always a treat when you upload a video.
You’re a good salesman, I’d buy a rock if you were presenting it to me!
you should make a channel called chrisfish
I like the price of ratchets  thought they would be higher priced I will ask    Santa for those this year
Yes!!! I’ve been waiting for this!!!!!
YES IT'S FINALLY HERE! Now it feels like Christmas! Thanks for this tradition!!!
You got a ChrisFish 2nd channel?
Wonder what his neighbors think when they see a guy in a Santa costume working on cars
He doesn't show his face in the book either!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!  😂👌🏾
Hey Chrisfix I’m a major fan of your videos, I think an additional video you should do is how to hook up an extractor vacuum to your car, I’ve been carrying mine in my trunk because I’ve gone through multiple power inverters that can’t power it
You are an amazing person❤
Just a heads up, by showing the QR code you are opening up the unlisted video to anyone who is willing to take the time to decode it.
Merry Christmas Chris and family cannot wait for more videos!!!
Love the book idea starting my son off early so the code to see visual noise you read is awesome
Rock on Chris 🤘
I love the Santa wink please make that also a tradition 😉🎅🏽 definitely getting the book YOU'RE THE GOAT
YESSSS WE MADE IT
Lift with the knees even when undoing bolts 👍
Yay my favourite youtuber posted!
I don’t know when this man will lose all of his gloves
How to change a tyre, for 8 to 10 year olds... Or a 36 year old wife 🤣
Take that ugly ah helmet off, good video tho
My kid might enjoy the book
Me very well knowing that I will never get any of these gifts but still waiting. 🤝🏼
Love the book idea!
Never knew u had a book published my gift to u Chris a a purchase of the book merry Xmas  Chris
Thinking about buying the book just because of the transparency he showed about the money he makes.
i like my little m12 tire inflator. m18 wasnt out when i got mine though
I have several snap on straight and angled ratchets of different lengths, but by far my favorite ratchet is my mastercraft telescoping ratchet. Someone gift me that set :')
waiting for the supercharges driftstang. and ebay turboed del sol. still love this one
Thanks Chris - nice to have you back on YouTube. Merry Christmas. PJW
Hey Chris,  I hope you will read this, but thanks for the hard work, I recently saw the podcast of you.  I know how hard it is and you are dedicated to get the maximum out of your videos to entertain us as much as possible, but most importantly, you teach us as much as possible and with every experience.    I really appericiate your effort in videos and now that you got your own branding is amazing. Not for marketing or for the money. But for quality tools and books for maximum information and to help out as much as possible. And I really seen you grow from a "meh" ish sounding guy to an really excited guy about even the smallest bolt. That shows that even through hard times you try to stay positive to get the best outcome and result. Like what u said in the podcast. You are there to help out  as much as possible to solve any kind of problem anyone can encounter with their vehicle.  We all appericiate that even with the almost 10 million subscriber, you care about everyone. And you haven't changed your personality just because you are "famous"  I know how much time it takes to get a video edited how you want it. I had it with my projects, 3 min what took me over 5 months because it wasnt good.   Not just your hard work, but also your attitude. Like in the last videk Walking up the stairs, to donate $5000. Shows how wonderful you are. Your goal of having views is great, and your personality does not change. Alot of youtubers Youtubers change as person just because they know they make a dime.  Thank you Chris. You just don't teach people, and help people. But for all the effort you want to put in your videos just to keep us informed and entertained :)  Now I will sit down and enjoy watching this video.
17:04 My leg works just fine
This book is awesome!
This is more of a stuff in gonna buy for myself list then a gift idea list tbh
Your are the absolute car king, what is the best website to buy car parts from in your opinion Chris?
I didn't even finish the video and already purchased the ratchets. Love what you do Chris! Thank you for all your help and keep up the good work!
Now I know what to get😂
You are a blessing to the human race. God bless you brother
Book Idea:  Red Light, Yellow Light, Green Light! (can talk about red: no nos, yellow: so so, green: good to go or whatever) in terms of how to change small things that can help prolong the vehicles. What to do, what not to do,  or however it works.
You record this before the new pavement of the entrance whaat
DAYUUUM!❤️
@chrisfix I need your opinion on what is the best brand for tools like house hold tools. also love watching all your videos and was waiting all year for this video hope you have a great holiday season merry christmas
Water injection vacuums are great, but the Bissell one is not good quality. Mine has a shitty nozzle and the air leaks out of the little  removable plastic cover they have on the nozzle, therefore the suction is not that good.
Wtf you’re a mechanic a marine biologist and a professionally trained chef
Chris Fix = 🎅
i  own that knife sharpener i love it makes pocket knives never been sharper
Excuse me....Culinary school?  Edit: Excuse me....Shark fishing??
Can't wait for my blinker fluids this year
THE PICK WITH THE HOLE IS ACTUALLY A LEATHER TOOL FOR STITCHING LEATHER. I ONLY KNOW THIS BECAUSE I WAS A BOY SCOUT.
Most epik vid of 2022
Can we just appreciate that he unbled his brakes and wrapped presents just for this video.
I’m obsessed with this video. Already ordered the book!!
I ordered your book!  Can't wait to read it with my 6 year-old son.
Merry Christmas Chris!
I’ve been needing this video for a while now
ChrisFix'Mas! You missed out on it!
Dang! Can't believe I have been watching your videos for over seven years now! Thanks for all the tips over the years. Wishing you and your family a happy holiday!
Definitely gonna get some for my friend ☺️
Video Idea  How to install a dash cam in your car (front and back )
Why hide your face when your old video on window tinting shows your face
Hey guys ChrisMas here.
I love your videos (and I am just 7!)
Chris, you should take all the money from the affiliate code usage for these gifts and donate it to a local food bank.
I like the teddy Santa blinking his eye when zooming in before the unwrapping
Great stuff, thanks Chris
👍🏼100% your the best
Wow, i was just thinking about getting a extractor. and here you saying i should get one
I heard his voice echo. His neighbors definitely know who they live next too. "HEY GUYS CHRIS FIX HERE!!!"
Hey Chris how long will the extendable ratchets be on amazon for?
This is awesome. Chris Fix has always been there for us!
you've been doing these for so long. glad you have a book and your own branded tools to sell for some more profit for you.
i'm a bit disappointed to see that chris doesn't wear the helmet when fishing
Is there a discount if I buy everything? 😆
Do they sell those ratcheting flare nut wrenches individually by size? A 7/16 would get used everyday doing cable work.
So nice! But anyway 8 days before xmas is still a bit short. But good tips for next year. 👍🏻💪🏻
Already bought the book for my daughter. Merry Christmas and thank you for all the awesome videos
Yo it's so awesome to see that you put out a book for the kids man, what an accomplishment. Your a real as it gets man way to go Chris. Merry Christmas to you and your family man. God bless
The biggest thing I think of when YouTubers launch a product that are as worthy as you are is; if this turns out to be completely crap it's gonna reflect onto the YouTuber themseleve for creating/endorsing it.
When is the driftstang coming back...,m
Face reveal at 10 million
Not you wearing the Santa suit the whole video 😂
*Project Farms has entered the chat
Thanks for the video ❤
didnt know i wanted a chris fiz tool till now that i see he released a extendable ratcheting wrench set
LETS GOO 😄🤩
cool bro !!
I like to pretend that all the videos are 100% voiceover and that the neighbors are just looking at chris in a santa costume waving his hands around silently
Is nobody gona talk about then engine in the backround???
Not even done watching your video. But I want to say: you help me learn and understand how cars work and how ik can fix them. I don't even have my own driving licence but I'm still working on my friends cars (I'm 28) Thanks for learning me and grzz from the Netherlands
After spending all my money for all the shit we have at home, I'm still wishing my wife gives me a breaker bar and a set of socket wrenches 😮‍💨
i just bought my little siblings gifts and your book sounds too great of a pass off, damn it chris if only you posted the video yesterday 😩😭
Thanks for the video
Been waiting on this one! Thanks Chris 🤘🏽🤘🏽
More vids 2023 please. Your content rocks and is super helpful.
Merry Christmas Chris!!!  I love that you wrote a Children’s book.  It’s already in my cart for purchase.  Can’t wait to get it.
Woow amazing tools 😍
I never was into cars but after chris fix and the donut channel changed me
Next episode: Chris Fix shows his helmet  collection
When you said cordless for the air compressors, my mind immediately thought about the tube to hook the compressor to the tire and so i was like, bluetooth air?
Culinary school? Chriscooks???
This was very intriguing ❤
Hey Chris are you still supercharging your mustang?
Happy to see videos from you and always great ideas, keep it up always great content and a great person with such a good way to get to all of us to learn and wrench greetings from Colombia!
PLEEEAASE DO A "ALL ABOUT CARS" TYPE VIDEO I grew up watching them show small usefull things like to change a tire but it was a TV show
I just looked at the pinned comment and it's a great thing that you encourage kids to like cars!
loved this video, the illistration on the book is amazing!  I never managed to get that project car running lol it would have been too much, but i did end up fixing up a 2007 cobalt that is now my daily thanks for your vids
Feels later than usual this year but nevertheless I’m happy it’s here
How about promoting reading too!
Ooo I really like your ratchet set, just ordered a set!
I am a 13 year old boy who loves cars and back in may my dad wanted my help and I helped him tighten his lug nuts on his Mercedes e55 and I put 4 new winter wheels on my dads c class on my own
Love the video as always! Grest job on the kids book. Nice to see someone out there take the time to want to educate kids and get them interested in cars. Also before I even watched the video I hit the Like because seeing the fact you had perfectly wrapped those tools and took the time, Much respect. I always enjoy your vids. You seem very sincere and not out there for  fame Just enjoying your self and doing what you love while educating us.Merry Christmas to you and your family
14:54  I have the small milwaukee M12 inflator and it is the best compact inflator that I've used. Set your pressure, let it do its thing and it shuts off after it reaches the target temperature. Also has attachments to pump other everyday items, and all stores nicely behind the unit.  I suggest a Milwaukee M12 XC4.0 to go with the M12 Inflator so you have the capacity and power.
This was an expensive video 😅  Grabbed the book, torque wrench, and steam cleaner. And the extending ratchets and bolt checker are on my wishlist for later.
Love your vids, but this's kinda l8 man :(
All good!
What about the blinker fluid and piston return springs?
i NEED that lug torque wrench lmao
Book alone got you a like! Thanks Chis!!!!
Hell ya, it's here!!!!
Realizing it's been a whole year and I still haven't gotten to the last 3 year's versions of this video
I respect your honesty and transparency, just ordered a book for my son and hopefully some support for your hard work and dedication over the years.
I saw the tire inflator in one of your shorts earlier this year and I already asked for one for christmas!
love this video, was waiting for it.
YEESSS YEEEES YEEEEEEEES THX CHRIS at my place its currently 00.15 am i don't care tomorow i have school i cannot let this video slide without watching it now.
That shop vac attachment is what I have been looking for my whole life.
Chris, you are so awesome. Buying multiple copies of the children's book. Amazing.
Can’t go wrong with a Chrisfix holiday YouTube video
I recommend using distilled water in the steam cleaner. Over time tap water will begin to clog the lines inside of the steamer and cause premature failure
22:56 -- Damn that's a BIG bass! 😂😂😂  Time to start a new channel... "ChrisFish"
getting the book!
😂👌🏻
Santa came early this year!
Really cool tools ,love it 👌🏼
Chris well done i love your videos:)
Love the book! Congrats!
Haha cooper is super cute! He's as cheeky as my dog.
Chris is one of the most unique Santas I've seen, fantastic vibe, this video is like a Christmas gift
That book is so cute. It’d be really cool if they were sold in book stores.
When he said 7th annual my heart dropped.. 7+ years ive been watching and wow.
18:51 is that knife sharpener approved by Gordon Ramsey? 🧐🧐🧐
For the extractor I’d go with the SpotClean Pro (Little Green Pro) over the standard Little Green. Bigger tank and stronger suction. 10:00
this guy just always makes such entertaining contant he never trys to show off or like that without him we would never know anything about cars he just keeps things very budget friendly and super simple you always show what hard work looks like hope you get to 10 million subs soon  :)
These are all cool ideas to get!  Also can you recommend an entry level one scanner?
i love these videos, its interesting
When you said "ok cooper" it set off the Google assistant on my phone haha
been waiting all month for this😎
Time is soooo fast and another Christmas gift ideas
8-12 year Olds? I'm a "boomer" and I won't one. The next book should be "How to find a charging station".
just in time for next Christmas.. lol
These videos are helpful for finding the perfect tools you’re missing! Great work
I had a good laugh seeing the cavity wax in action and hearing you describe it. Another great video, Chris. I hope you have a Merry Christmas
Chris fix a legend
just bought a BMW, you know i need every single one of these.
that reverse brake bleeder is a game changer
Love them Ty ChrisFix
the pup is always a highlight
that book looks cool im going to go ask my mom to get me that and also have a merry Christmas ChrisFix  and have a great day your the best
who noticed the toyota in the background…
This is great
I’m having my first kid this upcoming June I’m about to order the book to put with the other books we bought but I told my wife I’m reading that book first so I can be able to say my kids first book was by ChrisFix 😂😎💯 merry Christmas bro can’t wait to see all your 2023 videos
Cooper out there living his best Christmas life 🤘🏻
The flair set is a game changer I love it
Good man CF thanks again for the quality content over the years 👍🏽  much love from the Bay area!
That’s awesome that you wrote a whole book
🎅
hi chris fix a fan of your work i really like how you fix cars but first is there a giveaways or no second please buy another junk car and fix it like a lambo there's alot "in dubai"
Let’s simply dedicate a minute to congratulate how much hours and work she placed in these clips!! 😀
💯❕❕❕❕
I need those ratchets especually for work plz make them available
I have a very similar version of the Bissell extractor. It is awesome. I just bought an old ranger and sucked about a liter of black water with skin cells and body oils out of the seat
14:50 I'll admit it. I have myself a Bauer tire inflator that I got for Christmas a few years ago. Served me well for multiple years, and it's either 12 volt or battery powered, and it's not only usable to inflate tires, I use it for pool inflatables, air mattresses while camping, and many more.
8:57 Hoping the artichoke hearts come with my bleeder kit, haha. And I remember the water injection vaccum cleaning your car good as new, good times. Stay safe, thanks Chris.
I thought the crate engine was one of them hahahaha
I'm sending this to all I know.  Hopefully they get the hint and I don't get another cat calendar this year.
Let’s goooooooo Waited for a new video
I wonder if the steam cleaner would safely work in an engine bay
I am buying those ratchets no question
It's fucking time again!!!!!
I own all your merch you are the best
Babe wake up! New ChrisFix dropped!
I love you man make more videos plzz
Cool 😀
I got a boroscope and I absolutely love it. It paid for itself the first time I used it cleaning out my gas tank on my truck
Just superb, great entertainment ChrisFix the most down to Earth and professional YouTuber out there 👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧
Once I saw the Chrisfix ratchets I had to buy them 😅. Those bad boys will be getting some good use.
Pause video. Ordered book. Watch video again!
Looking foward to buying these for my dad who loves this kind of stuff maybe my grandpa to since he owns his own shop! Better not give him a heart attack 😂😂😂
Just think passing by, and just watching this guy récord this
Second video asking, for a drag race series Love the video by the way ❤
Khris ficks
When will you do a face reveal
Funnily enough, my mum bought the same Bissell that you've got here in the video on Black Friday. Yesterday and Wednesday, I spent my time shampooing and cleaning the seats and the carpet and used your video as the guide for it :)))
Boom book is bought!
This is better than your average christmas
Lovely
YESSSS cant wait to buy them, just in time my man
Volim te fikse krise❤
The only thing I’m a bit iffy with is the reverse brake bleeder, since the master cylinder has a primary and secondary seal, not to mention the metering and proportioning valves. The primary and secondary seals are notorious for leaking. So idk if forcing air/old brake fluid in the opposite direction would cause damage to the seals.
I’m glad you wore a helmet, I don’t think I’m physically ready to see your face
that jeep had me so confused cause i thought it was a humvee for a second LMAOOOO
OK so I pauses straight away because I always watch it with him on the weekends I am so exited for this new vid
A knife sharpener is perfect for my car.
Ohhhh shittt!!!!!!!!!
Chrisfix a hummer h1 is my dream car to and you are my favorite youtuber
Yay
guys what's the music playing in 12:15 called  and i want the exact version please
[0:59] 🔞 • *PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT CONTENT!* • 🔞          ❄️ *"Let is snow, let it snow, let it snow!"* ❄️      🎵 (blares *"Let It Snow"* by *Twisted Sister* on stereo) 🎵
Love these, only wish they came out in November
Hi chrisfix I'm a big fan
Excellent idea on the book
Hello Chris, and happy holidays, hope you're well. I really enjoy your films. I know you are a crazy busy guy but I said to myself why not shoot my shot at it. I recently got myself my first car in high school being a 1993 keep Cherokee. Being quite old but a beauty. She has her issues and there's a lot I'd like to do. My point is I'd love to be able to meet you, along side work on it and even you able to make some YouTube films out of it. Otherwise enjoy your films and keep up the work. Thanks
Can you do a video of installing a nice speaker system in to a car
I love your videos Chris! You always have some really cool tools every year!!
Honey, the guy across the road is dressed as santa talking to his presents again! Leave him alone, he's a good man! You sure.. idk Yea, send the kids over for a picture
Why do you have gloves on when not working on vehicles
Can you do a motorcycle series?
The new video I've been waiting for the new supercar, suggestion for 2023 buy a classic car to bring to the channel
CHRISSSS YESSIR
best damn Santa I ever seen in my life
Might want to do this a bit earlier next year. Everyone's on strike in the UK so we had to get stuff early
I'm a mechanic and I buy one of these tools Chris recommends every year. Never regret it!
12:52 it helps even better if you spray it let it sit for a minute or two then use a drill brush attachment agitate and lift that dirt up and then vacuum it or if you don't have a drill use a hand scrubber for like a bathroom
Neighbor: oh no not this again...
Totally worth staying up late for this!
You're awesome Chris good idea with the book
Happy Holidays to you Chris! Another great year, your videos are always of use to me. Keep up the great work!
Hey my grandad love cars and when his car is bad he take it to the shop
Wtf is a Christmas
I was thinking about this video on the bus when I going home.  Edit: The fact that this guy also made a children’s book is awesome. When my little brother grows up. I gonna teach him about cars, how to fix them. And the book can be helpful. 👏😄
This video and your commentary highlights the qualities you have and your positive attitude, genuine interest in the things you do and congratulations on the book that is going to be a great introduction to whoever is lucky to have a copy!!! Merry Christmas and Happy new years 🎅
Finally here
I was waiting for this video 👍
I live in Turkey and I have been following you very fondly for a long time. I want to participate in this lottery, but even if I win, how can you send me. Wishing the new year to bring happiness, dear people from I live in Turkey and I have been following you very fondly for a long time. I want to participate in this lottery, but even if I win, how can you send me. Wishing the new year to bring happiness from Turkey, love 😊
Nice list man.
Heck yeah!!!
You look like motor-santa Get It? No..? Anyway, cool video!
Can’t believe it’s been 7 years since the first!
It's time for the Christmas tradition of the ChrisFix Holiday Special!
The book is awesome Chris.
I watched all the other 6 like 2 hours ago lmao I love the new book!  Btw I am the guy that contacted you on IG abt personal info that you leaked.
The book lol
Can you review the LTT (LinusTechTips) screwdriver?
Where is the supercharger on the drift stang????
Chris came in clutch with another awesome list 😮‍💨
I love that your dog helps to unwrap the gifts😃👍🇺🇸
Hi chris fix Thank you so much for all the videos this year keep up the fantastic work thank you again
Hi Chris
thanks for the quality videos!
A great present form Chris is a new DRIFTSTANG VIDEO
Chris I love the kids book, my little brother will love it
I was literally waiting for this video to come out, and the classic song you would use in every one of these.
I’ve had that exact Bissell extractor vacuum for about six months now And I have to say it does wonders
Mom, he's doing it again.  That guy is outside dressed as Santa talking to a camera while opening other people's presents!
Yoooo, that book literally warmed my heart.
Genuinely shocked soapy water didn’t make the list. 😭
ChrisFix 🤴
always coming in clutch (pun intended)
So Chris makes a book and have his own product line, Mf is going places
Christmas for making this video and also we will always carry your support and also I love learning about cars with you
Awsome gifts 🎁 👍
Alright, loved the video Chris but maybe post this a month or so before Christmas so people can see it, and order it so it will arrive for Christmas. Just some constructive criticism for you.
I've never seen such transparency in a YouTuber selling products since Linus Tech Tips! It's refreshing to see you actually selling quality merchandise and not some scummy rebranded Chinese junk. Much love and appreciation ChrisFix!
Love that you have a book published! It’s so nice seeing a big youtuber giving back and not letting clout and fame get to them. You haven’t changed at all over the past 4 years that I’ve been watching you, your video quality is always spot on, you are always realistic, you don’t buy fancy sports cars that the average person can’t afford. You show gratitude to your family, and overall you’re just a great guy! Hope you and your family have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Happy Holidays Chris....Awe Cooper.  He is so cute.
I got a video idea how to replace your transfer case
Chris Fix is really that kid on The Fabelman's.
sending this video to my gf rn
Been waiting for this!👏🏽👏🏽
Sent this to my gf right when I saw this thanks Chris 🙃
I’m 13 but I still want that book
amazing idea with the book, keep up the good work💪💪
When are you gonna meet up with the Hoonigan team to go racing?
A little late don’t ya think?
W chrisfix
I wish I had experience like you with cars but I’m 16 and my mom doesn’t want me to break anything on the car😅
Sooooo STOKED!
Honestly my favorite video of the year
lego
love the videos big fan for a long time. Congrats on your success and the book!
Keep up the work chris! Was waiting for this video.
You a real one for that book sir super great idea love it 🙏🏾
Chris is probably the most transparent and down-to-earth YouTuber with 10 million subs
Thumbs up given before the video began!!  🖖🇺🇦🙏
Who else is doing a nostalgia run from the very beginning 7 years ago
Only Chris video is worth watching.
These are my favorite videos

Always a good day to see ChrisFix upload! Also did you're new monitor arrive? Saw that your old one been giving you trouble.

Couldn't wait for this to come out, thank you!
Haven't killed a single ryobi too yet, although I've seen like 6 M18 batteries die for no reason
I did not expect a children’s book about changing a tire, well done
Ohhh yahh
How do I send this to her without sending it to her
Honestly can't wait to see his reaction 3 years from now when it's been a whole decade
