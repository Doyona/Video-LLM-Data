And the fun fact is this is true 🔥✅✅
Another cinderella story
But they did get Kubrick  🤔
2:05 1971 Chevelle in 1969 movie
Truth in plain sight. They know how far peoples perceptions have been manipulated. Truth in movies and lies on news.
When you can’t convince people otherwise resort to parody!
Ahhh Good ol karmic retribution 😅😅😅 tell after doing them 😂😂😂

Columbia Pictures And Apple Original Films Present
I finally got a chance to watch this, and thought it was great!  feel like the PR team let this film down, because there is more nuance than the previews reveal.  They really did capture a lot of the wonder and tension surrounding this mission - some timely commentary as well.

United Statians trying too hard to attempt against our intelligence…
Natasha roamoff. this is Tyler Gage.
This is actually a documentary on how they faked the moon landing.
What in the name of Playstation 2 graphics is happening at 1:23? :D
The earth is flat and the moon is a reflection of the earth on the firmament
done old fashioned
We 1000% faked the moon landing. Most experts take this position today.  All of you waiting for Wikipedia to update the 'Moon Landing' page are lazy, uninformed & wrong.

DJ JACQUIE -THIENG STAR-TO THE MOON-CHAINZ
THIS IS THE REAL STORY OF HUMAN LANDING ON THE MOON
How many people in the comments are science majors? I’ll wait…
Just watched it and it was bad. It's boring and not funny. It is way too long for this kind of basic and ridiculous storyline.
Looks lame.
No. Humans didn’t go to the moon. Pure fiction.
Just wish Scarlett's hair didnt look so wig like. 😮😅
F this movie, TRASH
Great movie. Just morons believe we put a man in the moon
Channing Tatum is such a horrible, boring actor.
Oh my god I need to watch this
Too bad Scarlett is a total witch with a B!

NOW they want to admit the Truth...🙄  The US government corporation makes me sick to my stomach...
Remember Nasa has a star in Hollywood just like other famous entertainers. Its a fact. The Movie Fly Me To The Moon basically played in your face also.
Found this film boring. Maybe because I went into it expecting a comedy? And it's more about the moon landing.  There was a couple of funny moment's, but other than that it was boring.. didn't help with it being a longer film too.
stanley kubrick " the shining " and nasa sp237  " what ( the key ) made apollo a success ? "   shy , (R)idicule , overlook ?
This was very good. I was pleasantly surprised. I never was a fan of Scarletts but she had some actng chops in this film. Greg is a good director, has a nice style of filming. The rocket launching shots were fabulous!
Who let dean direct a movie again
Scarlett is absolute perfection in this movie. Such a beautiful woman. Love the look of the 60s style of dress.
Should we take it as a sheepish tacit admission before DOGE releases all.

Based on a true story (obvious joke)
TV programming at its best . I believe we never went to the moon and movies like this just prove that point

Just watched it, good movie
You know it’s a lie because there are no Nazis in the movie…. If it wasn’t for debus (which has an award named after him now, oh and hall at nasa….oh don’t forget von braun. You wouldn’t have even left the planet. They should have planted 2 flags up there. Seem to forget the death they caused and yer making slapstick movies which are insults…..  And I’d post the pic of Kennedy sitting with them if I could. In NASA. Your old pres sitting next to war criminals….in America’s space agency….

making a film of a film of the moon landing😅
Loved this film. Very well done. Highly enjoyed it. Thank you so much magical cast!
After people find out and talk more and more about the truth, Americans come out to say; ok we made a film, that’s true, but we also land on the moon, how pathetic! Every thing for the pride of being American. If people didn’t talk about this, would they come out to say that they made a fake movie? Ps. Truth always come out!
I love them both! I can't wait to see it tonight .( Finally !)
Oh no... The conspiracies 😂 looks good though

Do you think Colin Jost (Scarlett's husband) has noticed that Tatum looks a bit like him? If he was put through the Super Soldier program. I give Che permission to steal that one.
what hollywood won't do to give overpaid stars like Scarlett Johansson and Woody Harrelson screen time and multi-million dollar paychecks. Apollo 11 funding was not in jeopardy as the movie portrays, a lot of what is shown is laughable to anyone in the profession. Not to mention that they've got the spotlight on some journalist as the main protagonist instead of the people who were actually flying to the moon
I had to come an find this I should have heard about this

1967 Camaro with a rear spoiler. The spoiler didn't come out until 1968.
This is an excellent movie, splendid in fact, watched 3 times and love it even more!
Movie is absolutely brilliant! Just watched it and it was very good.
PROOF THE MOON LANDING WAS FAKE
This was such a great film the trailer did it no justice
woke bs. First scene: boss babe, humiliating and emasculating men. No, thank you.
i have just seen this movie. and i believe nasa really sent a man on the moon. but the clear photos released by nasa are no doubt shot on a stage. it so clear considering that the camera mounted on the astronauts are poor quality camera.
FLY ME TO THE MOON mistake? In the movie, they called today's Russia "Russia". But in 1969, during the Cold War era and space race, the correct geopolitical term for today's "Russia" is the "Soviet Union" or "USSR." People and media of that era often referred to the citizens of the USSR as "Soviets" when discussing state actions or international competition, especially in the context of the space race or military conflicts.  Even during the Soviet era, "Russian" was still used to describe the ethnic Russians within the Soviet Union, as Russia was the largest and most dominant republic of the USSR. However, calling all citizens of the USSR "Russians" was inaccurate, as the USSR encompassed many nationalities and ethnic groups, such as Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, and others.  The term "Russian" was never completely replaced during the Soviet era. For example, in less formal settings or in countries less familiar with Soviet political terminology, "Russian" might have been used as a general catch-all term, even if it wasn’t entirely precise.  Artistic Choices in Movies: In the case of "Fly Me to the Moon," the writers might have chosen "Russians" for the sake of simplicity and audience recognition. Modern audiences may associate the term "Russians" more readily with the geopolitical rival of the United States, regardless of the historical distinction. While this could be seen as a mistake in historical accuracy, it’s also a deliberate choice to prioritize accessibility over precision.  In 1969, "Soviets" would have been the more accurate term for referring to the USSR and its people in the context of the space race or state actions. If the movie writers referred to them as "Russians" without distinguishing the historical context, it could be considered a simplification or an oversight. However, given the dual usage of "Russian" both pre-1917 and informally during the Soviet period, it’s not entirely wrong, just less precise.
What a fictional piece of garbage.
FINALLY a truthful film out of Hollywood..

The stupidest 💩 I've ever seen
i can't believe hollywood is actually admitting that the moon landing was fake !!!  yes it was . wake up people!
Yiheeee ❤ did they fake it? 💯
CRY SO MUCH ON THIS I KNOW ASTRONAUT STORY OF THIS HERO! HE SO MUCH LOVE STORY. ITS NOT MAKE UP STORY I KNOW IN REAL PERSON ON THIS ON 1996 THIS WAS COUPLE ON MOON LOVE STORY I WAS THERE I LOVE ALL MEMORIES ON MOON SENTIMENT EXCEPT SECRET I DONT TELL HERE
Yikes, this movie was so bad I felt motivated to post this comment.
Tge mission costed 25 billions at list how can they pretend not to have money 😂
I love good movies... This... This is a good movie!
this movie is decent with a great soundtrack and witty stuff i love the black cat
Oh cool!  Love the actors, love the music, love the plot and the chemistry and the dialogue.  Music goes with the plot and yup…somehow, I feel like I am going to be laughing on this one.
I just saw this. I have to say, I’m very pleasantly surprised. The casting is perfect. Tatum was born for that era. He encapsulates the look and mannerisms of the day. And Scarlett’s character is smart, witty and charming. She’s like a Doris Day and young Kathryn Hepburn mix. I always love watching Woody in small and leading roles. He lights up the screen. It’s light hearted fun without being cheesy.
Cheesy boring movie.  If you are American you will definitely love it as it makes you proud of past success of the country. Past.
It's a lightweight comedy. So light that I wonder why these actors agreed to do it. It's rather mundane actually. It's pleasant enough but uninspired.

very fine film after a while.
@LesJakk Thanks  for your question. All of the worlds top esoteric leaders know this information,  and they keep the prevalence of this lie from the time that you are in the cradle to the grave. Please keep in mind,  that at one time,  i didn't know any of this. They start this brai washing in kindergarten,  with that globe of our world in the class, and they tell the kids, " this is where you live". And now that you can't leave your house and walk 10 feet without seeing someone holding a phone,  they have NASA employees,  hired to keep this lie alive, posting stories about some space mission, China,  India, sending a probe into outer space, etc. And we get a quick subliminal of these stories, because we are alway on the internet when we are walking around with our phones tethered to our hands. And these stories have a. Pictures of Mars, Saturn,  or some distant galaxy a trillion light years away, but its alway an artist rendition,  never an actual picture,  that they claim our super telescope captured. There are too many people on this planet that know that the earth is flat,  people from too many varied backgrounds that arent connected,  for this to be a falsehood.  You don't think that yiur world governments would lie to you like this because they are good decent, god loving folks,right? Some of the people that you and I know are looking kids that they love,  in the eyes, and telling them that someone named Santa Claus will be bringing them toys. They love these kids, they believe that they are telling them this for their own good. Why is our government telling us that the earth is a globe, and the moon and sun is real? By the way, did you know that the word planet means "Plan-et"?​@LesJakk
CIA/NASA shill funded anti moon hoax gaslighting shit show . An insult to anyone with a brain
I believe that it takes up to 8 hours for a rocket to dock in ISS with all the latest sensors and electronics. The hardest part in the moon 'landing' should have been the redocking with the mothership in orbit. That is not even mentioned in the movie. They don't want people to even know about this critical step and start raising questions.
Best documentary of 2024
There were NO black men in that NASA control room. NONE.

So they DID faked it?
I haven't watched the movie, but when I saw it included validating the conspiracy theory of faking the moon landing, I decided not to.  It seems now far too many question reality -and movies that show the extreme lengths government or corporations will go to cover up a conspiracy isn't helping.  I'll reject it in the free market way of not paying to watch it.
If NASA is fake and moon missions is fake then where's all the real space stuff like UFOs at . Antarctica ?

They already done a FAKE MARS LANDING movie some 4 decades ago....Better late then ever?

So is this movie just lying some more and saying, thet did go to the moon, but they made this fake ba kup just incase the moon mission failed? Because noone has been to the moon because there is no moon, thats a hologram! I dare the reader to research this, instead of taking the easy way out and calling me names. Every the United States Government has been,  they have bases and businesses there. If there was a moon,  there'd be a godamn Walmart and McDonald's up there by now.
Ein super Film :)
That's not going to help conspiracy theorists embrace reality... Oh well. They might as well have featured Stanley Kubrick's character rather than simply evoking him. If you're going to reassure all fans of the fake moon landing theory, you might as well go all the way, right?   But seriously... can they use Mr Kubrick's image? Do they have the right?
Are the costume people not aware women wore beige stockings back then?

I’m sorry, but I still stand by the fact that the moon landing does not exist. You’re telling me that NASA cannot find the documents of one of the biggest moments of space history lol really come on.
I honestly thought the poster was fake and it was for a joke in a movie... still doesn't look real.
Next thing coming out of Hollywood starring Tom Cruise, FLERF The Movie! You won't believe what the governments been hiding!

I guess it didn't help the moon landing conspiracy stuff
Just cause my dash cam footage was recorded over and my GPS data is missing, doesn't mean I didn't make the greatest journey of all mankind! Even though I constantly get caught lying you can believe me this time! I swear! 🤣
How about Faking the mission moon
La película no está mal pero el actor Tatum no pega para nada en el papel que hace.
The nassholes are finally admitting to stealing billions of dollars and lying about everything to do with so called "outer space" travel.  And still, the majority of mankind remains stupid and gullible.
Great
They're trying to ease it into the minds of the sheep in the world and when they tell them it was fake they say oh yeah I saw the movie not holy crap they lied to us for 60 years... It's all deception look up NASA in hebrew. It means to deceive...
I would love to go back in those days in every time that something went wrong with NASA I would just tell them that the commies have made their way to the moon and the US would start freaking out 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Wait Is this based on a true story?
Refreshing the lie every year 😁👍🏻
I think this is ‘fly me to the moon’ released summer this year.
Imagine the US showing a faked moon landing film to the people of earth - because what they actually found there was far too terrifying.

I love that this movie bombed hard! Shows just how MANY people are tired of seeing these bull crap Moon conspiracy theories.

This is what happens when you let a dean of a community college direct a movie.
So why is no one talking about the jokes about alien pods at the bottom of the ocean and the fact that one of the last key moments in the movie is scarlet asking woody about aliens and him weirdly saying that they walk among us.

One must wonder if during the filming of every Channing Tatum movie, the women on the Set get together one evening and watch Magic Mike...
is there Aliens out there? yeah its walk Amongst us 🫵
So when is this documentary coming out?
🤔 huh…I’ll be.

...and just like that - TRUTH, in plain sight.
At least one young Belgianman and his pals went to and on the Moon, namely Tintin and Professor Triphon Tournesol with Captain Haddock.

Oh look a movie designed to fool people into believing that we had the ability to send people to the moon. Now go watch the actual footage of the apollo 17 liftoff and come back and tell me why you're so stupid. We didn't have the fuel, knowledge or technology to get men on the moon and back to Earth. We might've been able to send their dead bodies to the moon because they would've been radiated to death a day before making it half way to the moon by the Van Allen Radiation Belt which wasn't discovered at the time. They would never have the fuel or technology to land in a specific spot on the moon back then and wouldn't have had the ability to shoot off the surface with enough force to somehow miraculously reconnect with the CSM that is orbiting the moon, at which point it would also lose signal when being completeley behind the moon. It amazes me that people still believe this shit.

Amazing , Channings playing Kamala and Scarletts playing trump !
Gambit & black widow
That fake southern accent was trash, just like the dog Harris and her bath soaked greens
I knew the moon landing was all staged and fake.

The elites make the movie for you so that when someone says something they will say that this one saw it in such a movie and they don't believe the truth... they laugh at us.
They never went to the moon!

Now the US went to the moon because a cat proved that US went to the moon. Lol
Pretty soon, this movie will disappear because of the Mandela Effect. In this movie, there will be a conspiracy theory
That's the reality..
A Real movie about a fake landing
NASA failed to bring back Sunita Williams shows that moon landing was fake .

i thought this was about Frank Sinatra for a hot minute
The new mutants - Official Trailer (HD).
Loved this movie 💜
True movie
I like the fact that they're saying that it's both real and a conspiracy and also the Kubrick references lol.  Chris Evans was supposed to be Cole, but I'll take Channing Tatum anytime!
Welp seems like we got our answer it was all CAP on the moon mission 😂  Now bring on the aliens 👽 and disappearing of humans for a peace treaty
Watched/Purchased the movie on AppleTV.  Showing a conspiracy topic in a funny way. It’s more of an entertainment movie.  Thank you @AppleTV @Apple  My review rating: 6.5/10
they gonna use this ultra fictional film as a bait to flat earthers, and flat earthers will think this is history, furthermore adding to their delusion and humiliation for my amusement.
is that the dean?

Seems kinda HIDDEN FIGURES (2016)
Lies are first rebuked, then overlooked, then tolerated and finally accepted.... Some have already reached the accepted part. Such a pity.
And now they admitted that and got away with it
a limited hangout?
Kubrick lol
That is what they actually did 😂😂
Woke movie. Don't watch. They don't like men. They don't like you
I can't watch this after hidden figures...

Scarlett and Channing should feel shame to act this movie...from Iraq
This film is so boring. Why was it even made? What audience is it trying to target?
They did hail ceaser together now fly to the moon
I got to see two hotties "fake" kiss. But Apollo 13 is still the better movie.
More realistic
Strongly suggest "Capricorn one" movie!

This was a great movie!!
Channing doesn't match any intellectual roles. Ppl just need to admit that he is not a versatile actor. He just doesn't have the look and the accents. Scarlett did good in this movie though👍 she's a bonafide actor.
I loved see Walter Cronkite in this movie.  Great movie enjoyed it very much

Also the earth is flat
If we went to the more or not is like sex . We really dont care if they faked it .
Pass
So it's like Wag the Dog. Woody Harrison was in that movie as well.
they went ahead and made a movie about them faking the moon landing, they are constantly mocking you, and you are all eating it up
Great movie!!!! Must watch!!!!!
So we are gonna use Channing Tatum to soft sell America that we faked the moon mission !  Sweet 😂😂
Say we didn't land on the moon without saying we didn't land on the moon
The flat earther and moon landing hoax morons are out in numbers in these comments. Jesus...at least I'm no longer surprised by the average stupidity/insanity levels possible. I just wish we'd re-open the asylums. Sooo many people need help and aren't getting any.
so did the gambit finally marry black widow in the end?
Wakey wakey.
another crap from yanks        100% the entire mission was bs
We need the next "jump street" again pls
“Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth” and know one does it better than the US government.
Funny comedy indeed, especially when they made it appear they actually landed there.
black widow and gambit.. damn..
I was right its was never real lol
Trash
Hhhhhh.... they was flight to nevada or algeria!
Black widow and the gambit
This literally a documentary with a twisted end right?
And thats how they did it😂😂😂😂
Why are we even making movie about this???? What a waste!
F**king NaSA lie us lol
You mean to fake it. Damn they are spitting truth right in the open knowing people wont pick it up.
Making a movie about a movie :))))
what a mess of a movie is this
How many years will I need to wait until there is a movie worth watching again?
No need to see the movie anymore. Trailer told us everything 😂
Ninja Please!
god this song and movie is total horseshit because of the famous rat pack people frank fuckin sinatra. i don't like listening to this song ever again except my way is a murder song in the philipines
Hilarious how they always show any alcoholic drink as being inflammable.
Perez Michelle Davis Donald Harris Kimberly
For years I have been saying it they never went to the moon y'all never listened.
why do they always expose the conspiracy theories later in movies??
So its a documentary ?
They are now accepting that they never Landed on the moon.😂😂😂 Fake
The biggest liar in the wold😂 American
wait i thought this was gonna be a frank sinatra biopic but thinking tatum aint look nothing like him
Seems about right. actually would explain a lot
How big were the Beatles really ..............on the level of Michael Jackson?😆
What happened to scarlet boobies?
Kubrick's last interview revealed that the moon landing was his greatest achievement. The whole thing was a fake.
Goin to watch this for scarlet
This movie would do exactly what it was purposed to do,  annnd Ilove it.

Base on true story
The fact is this is a true story.
Whenever I see him, I hear "My name Jeff" in my head..
The reality is that moon landing was faked and that is today a proven fact.
Another moon movie?
How the hell did they not choose frank sinatras song for this trailer. They had one job bro 💀

Whether you believe the moon landing was a hoax or not, this movie is interesting..   A lot of people don't know this, but we haven't been "back into space" since the early '70s.
Looks like Marc Bolan’s estate sold his song . Tsk tsk
Aren't they toooooooooo old for Romantic movies
I believe this version to be the truth 😂
this is not a trailer this is a spoiler
The way i see it the producers nowadays are getting more lazier by each day.  Produce whole movie with AI .  No original storyline  No action  Casting is excellent but the story is very stale  People doesn't want kevin hart anymore. They need crime and war stories.   We need John wick or Nobody or Noryang deadly sea.
Conspiracy Theorist rn : tolddd yaaa
Sooooo should we wait for a movie about how 911 was an inside job? Cant wait for that one
As a space nerd, this movie looks painful to watch.
For that kind of movies ,is Kubrick joke to make them in 5min when was at life
i knew it
Soo they now for real saying nasa is HOLYWOOD ah thats good cause it is
Base on a true story
My two favs❤️
Actually the fake one was the truth . But the fact that u made it real at the end is the real bulshit
Americans are so obsessed with the Russians almost every Movie about war or has to do with NASA they always compete against the Russians....lol im beginning to think that the Russians are not bad as the Americans portrays them to be
Black widow X gambit 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Gambit and Black Widow the Multiverse is real
havent watched yet. but might gonna like it
He's gonna make his name himself here
needed more diverse characters
So this is a documentary?
I just watched this and I love it. I hope to watch Scarlet and Channing team up again next time.
"My name is jeff"
Is this a documentary?
"fly me to the moon"
Btw who had setup the camera on the moon outside the space craft!! Camera was there to film them stepping on the moon surface in wide angle before they were even outside the space craft? So they have the brains to land on the moon but lack common sense! 1969 common sense of nasa!☠☠😂😂
Black Widow & Gambit
So apple is now proven to be flat earthers 🤣
Ohhhh no🙄.   Their brains are already broken !   …now this is foing to make them think their insane beliefs are real !   Omg 🤦‍♂️
BUZZ WOULD LOVE THIS
... Just a backup Film so that we don't lose face with the Russians? Idk how to respond to that one! It's a Fresh Look at it.
Killer lunar laser eliminator sir.😂😂😂
Is this why I've been seeing this old joke pop up again? The joke works cause historically. They were in fact planning to fake it if the mission failed. A lot of the evidence people use about the moon landing being fake is from unsealed documents of them in fact planning to fake it lol. It's why it's so hard to convince them otherwise and why the joke started.
The moon = trash
this movie make me feel ( SHY ) and  ( RIDICULE ) to speak something about ( plan B )  and ( apollo 11 press conference )
Romance? I thought it was "Mr. & Mrs. Smith". lol
Dude this movies underrated asf!
This is how they are grooming you to eventually admitting they never went to the moon.
T H E  O U T F I T S  are horrendously magnificent especially the colors  in the 70’s my parents had their 60/70’s clothes hanging in their closets  I’m a graduate of ‘77 Modesto California  I was a lowrider esse type style guy  I wore my dads like zoot suite style casual clothes to formal gatherings  scarlet’s wardrobe here is lovely pastel         forget the movie  I’m only for great movies  which is rare🙏🏽🇬🇺
See I told you
this movie make me feel ( SHY ) and  ( RIDICULE ) to speak something about ( plan B )
remember challenger luch in the 80s ....they are manipulating minds thats it
Anyone know the name of the song playing?
Got to the part where Johansson enters the board meeting and turned it off  Yeah I see the propergander angle at work here.  Big bad men being put in their place by strong independent woman   BUT IN THE PAST 🥱   YAWN Holywood. Serious YAWN !!!   Crazy how we’re being brainwashed into believing that women are tough today when they cant even define what a woman is, have their own public toilets or compete in sports  consisting of only women  Crazy innit??
They even make a movie about a the creation of fake landing moon movie, but in this movie, they really land on moon and say they only create a backup fake moon landing movie in case something goes wrong, omg America will do everything just to cover their precious fake moon landing history
LOL neil amstrong
I don't Channin was the best option for this role, and pairing him with Johanson, a really power star. Well, I guest we'll see.
Another movie that warns us clearly about Aliens but no one seem to get it, they are preparing us for the big reveal!
With all the things the U.S has committed regime change, multiple wars probably the moon landing was fake too. We are in the year 2024 with all the latest technologies none have landed a human in the moon. So was it possible in the 1970s
"back up" aka what really happened....
I can't believe we got 'channing tatum x scarlet jhohanson fake moon landing conspiracy the movie' before GTA VI
Scarlett is fine AF in this movie wow
Is this a documentary?
This should go down in history but they said it happened sooo🤷🏽‍♂️😅😂
the is actually the fact, since they've already controlled the world, its time to indoctrinate this into our mind so that when it exposed, we accepted it easily
At last, they admitted it. The only real thing in America is Trump 😁
I'll watch anything with Woody Harrelson
Gambit ❤ Black Widow
I don’t doubt that we landed on the moon. I question the footage. Did you see the documentary Room 237?  I was in the last class at UCLA film school to use film. Did they bring a fill light and did an astronaut load a camera magazine? How did they did the flag to look like that?
Name of the song at 1:49???
The story of how Migo and Ash met
good like "kubrick" inside joke there
The Apollo Mission was NOT supported by the public???  Like the rest of this film…TOTAL LIE!! Fact: 95% of Americans were “Gung Ho” on going to the 🌕 moon.  In ‘69 I was 18 and very aware of what was going on in the USA.  Kubrick’s own daughter said the fake moon film idea was stupid.
That introduction is fire
QAnon is making movies now?
It's Gambit and Black Widow.
America u fake asses never went to the moon it's true and I believe it
The evidence of faking the moon landing has become too obvious. Thanks for attempting to blur the lines with this great movie.
So entire world an all long this time we have been lied by nasa?😂
Wish Stanley Kubrick directed the fake moon landing instead of 2001-A space odyssey.
The new mutants it’s a fun movie from 10 years fox pictures and marvel.
It better have the fly me to the moon song by frank sinatra in it!
We saw it today at the theater.  We really enjoyed it.  It was a light-hearted comedy.  Scarlett Johanssen does a great job and good supporting cast and good plot.  It was a nice diversion to go back in time to the 60s space program and have some laughs and remember parts of American history.
Outstanding very creative and whole theatre was laughing thank you!!!! And rocket scenes were incredible. Hats off to wardrobe changes and makeup
"My name's Jeff"
Great movie! Enjoyed it very much!
Black widow and the gambit 😂
Gee Whitakers, 1969 was a long time ago. Our grandparents could fly 240,000 miles one way and we are still trying to go 400 miles up!
A SINATRA SONG 🔥
What a boring film, total crap
Kubrick knew. But he was not directing. NASA film the simulation sites. Not in hollywood studio. They have life size models and mockups and even moon craters was as precise as can possible be. You not need such level of size and precision unless you not going to fake it. However in Area 51 the dark government have the tech to go to the moon for real. George Lucas knew that very well. He hired top engineer from the secret projects for his spaceships. He simply use real spaceship designs and was portrait as fiction while apollo claimed to real as hell but is bogus fiction. Real spaceship will look just like star wars sci fi. It will be much more like airplane than rocket. You cant use airplanes in cosmos... right? Wrong! But jet engines will not work in 1 bilion times less dense area.. yes unless its not bilion times stronger and more efficient jet engine; just like 1,44 Mb floppy disk and 1 Tb microsd card analogy. Million falcon simply has better engine. Hyperdrive is simply hyper jet engine. Thats it. Ship has mass of your car but thrust levels of bilion saturn 5 rockets combined.
They are literally telling us everything in films and we are still blind to it, calling it “entertainment.” No… it’s a confession.
Just another moon movie. Why not a uranus movie? With blackholes n all?
They should make a sequel where the earth is actually flat!
We told you so.
💩
This is based upon the fac that no one ever landed on the Moon, and, never will!
Parts of it were laugh out loud hilarious. But it needed more edits to keep it snappy. It did lag and play up an unsellable sentimentality. Should have made every scene focus on the brilliant hilarity, from the central idea (wonder where they got that), to Scarlett's kickass character along with her fun sidekicks, and not stray, ever.
Scarlett killed her role for sure. Man she was just good.
Charming, funny movie. Bit sad that it flopped so badly.
Thought that I heard cigarettes and alcohol there
Just letting us know if Artemis gets man on the moon it will be the first time but artemis is going badly because NASA don't have the  technology any more.
GROWN!!! 😒😒😒😒
Now I do believe that Apollo 11 landed on the moon however the film that was broadcasted to the world 🌎 was not the real deal. The motive behind this was to hide the extraterrestrial presence that was waiting on the moon. Just remember that when Apollo 11 returned home Neil Armstrong wasn't the same person he completely became a private person. I would argue that Americans weren't the first to land on the moon, that title belongs to Nazi Germany.
I knew it! I'm going to tell all my friends I told them so!
I can't wait to see this movie, tomorrow.
Someone make it make sense...If we "supposedly" been to the moon before...then why haven't we been back with all the technology we have now a days??
The sheer, idea of this would get you laughed out of NASA. And it is an insult to think anyone working on that project would agree to this
Bang a gong ,get it on. T Rex 1971.
Only me who hears that song as 'get on everything'? The song by the way is Big Bird by Eddie Floyd.
This may be the only second romcom I ever watch in over 40 years. Looks decent.
Mega boring film. The usual Hollywood twist, taking the truth and reversing it. Flopped.
I loved "Capricorn One."  This looks like the same premise, but as a comedy.  I can only hope it is as good.  🙂
Very good, scarlet plays an amazing part. A all round great film for a mild conspiracy theorist and entertaining enough to keep your partner entertained. 5☆
Frank would be proud…
Interesting story. A film About *staging a world event* and completely *fabricating the news* ....  This could _never_ *happen in real life* ?  Only in Hollywood :)
Fictitious story about a fictitious story. Somehow i suspect hollywood is not in on the joke.
... and the Beatles were created by the Russians to brainwash American youth.  Yes, REALLY.  It was in the boxes Trump home.
The fudge is it a documentery  a frank sinatra movie or a something else I cant tell
I love this movie. It was heartwarming and entertaining ❤️🩷💕 The soundtrack was so good. I sang along to the songs on a Sunday afternoon in the movie theater 💕🩷❤️
😂 that will success
Every line in this movie is so much FUN.
the roofs were sloped so, no sniper teams.
LMAO at the dust hanging in the lunar atmosphere. You should have dug up Kubrick for your movie.
Just one word: Mephisto !
Its physically impossible to go to the moon. Nothing or know one can get through the firmament that God created in which the sun and moon are set in place. Its called indoctrination.
News = lies Movies = truth
❤
This is much better than expected. I was expecting conspiracy theories laden with a strong girl boss protagonist with awoke agenda. Nope, my expectations were subverted in a good way.
❤❤
Nice Hollywood propaganda to land the conspiracy theory into a fact.
Now they are mocking us.
❤
❤❤❤❤ I love movie
❤
❤
A funny way to explain a top secret security fake achievement from the masters of Marketing
Don't you just love how they put truth in films and bs on television
I was surprised, it was a really good movie, light, enjoyable, funny, and acting was great and the theme of the Apollo mission and NASA was full entertainment.  The characters it had a great story from start to finish and woody was awesome and the director was funny.  Just a fun movie for the whole family or a great date night movie. Tatum and Johansen was perfect fit for this movie. ❤
❤
Is that   Ray Romano?
❤
❤
"Based on a true story."
Honestly, they show everything to people in movies, music videos etc and yet people still do not believe. I know, I know "It's just a movie", but actually you may find the most truth in movies than you will ever see on TV/mass media.
I saw this film recently (July 2024) and it qualifies as a five star romantic comedy for sure. Casting is amazing….only changes I’d make are Phyllis Smith (The Office) for ‘Ella’ and for ‘Stu’ my vision sees Michael B. Jordan in this role…really well performed. Thanks.
It’s amusing that even though in the movie, they show that the real landing is the one being televised, people here are still claiming it’s a conspiracy. Love it when people deny all evidence and fact and continue to make their own silly judgments.
Soft disclosure, in a time in which more and more evidence proving it was fake, is so sorely needed, and this Masterpiece of Negative Priming proves even more, they never happened.   People believe it JUST because it was on TV. Period and that's not up to debate.  To the paid Shills: shame on you. If you're even humans and not AI bots.
❤️
Uhm no Dean comment? Come on!
Channing has a lazy modern tone of voice so hard to believe him in another era of time but still looks decent
Love both cool actors , a revamp of Capricorn 1 with James Brolin , Elliott Gould and Telly Savalas, I hope the now generation love this movie  in 2024 all these " conspiracy theorists" comments give me the 💩give it a rest who cares ??? Enjoy the movie ,☯️🦋🦋🦋🦋you should know by now the. 🌎 doesn't revolve around you hold on feel a conspiracy coming on🤔!! 😂😂
looks like steaming trash on a hot summer day
I'm so disappointed 🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
I worked rescue and recovery for the Space Shuttle for 21 years.  The space program is VERY real.  Hey YouTube quit deleting everything.
❤
❤
Operation Avalanche much?? 🤔
Best movie I have seen in years
1:23 What's with the jarringly bad fake CGI guy here ( Nikita Khrushchev)? I mean that is just atrociously bad... snaps me right out of "watching movie" and into "what am I watching?" mode.
Low earth orbit is as far as man has been. How come NASA says in 2024 that they can't go to the moon because they lost the technology?
Who knows what the song is at the end of the movie, please?
This movie was a huge disappointment.  Wish I could get my money back.  Weak dialogue.  Overacting.  Empty story.  Don't bother.
Everyone is shocked that we haven't been there.👀🤷🏻‍♂️
"We're all living in America, Amerika ist wunderbar..."
Todays theory everything is fake we all just sit and watch we won’t know if anything is real or fake unless we go do it ourselves blame the internet/government for that one. Tv is suppose to be the devils work we watch it for years and years our whole lives get sucked into fake. Think outside the box, we are in it.
❤
❤
My two favorite actors
black widow from marvel and Jenko from Jump street By Fly me to the Moon Bravo 😎😎😎👏👏👏
Pass.
Cole Davis is, I think, based on Deke Slayton.
Excellent REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY movie 😜 😜 😜
Fly me to the moon. Let me play AMONG US
❤
The documentary about the movie...nice
❤
Watched the movie today it was really good🇮🇳. The dialogues- no lag screenplay & scarlett - channing tatum chemistry❤ everyone in the theatre really seemed to enjoy it too cause they were reacting heartily to all the subtle jokes
Omega found out their Speedmaster has been  selected as official watch - by watching footage from space. Not before.
x
before i watch this do they actually go to the moon in the movie
This is not my Armstrong 😂
It was easier to believe a conspiracy that we never went when no one else was going .... Now is its  different story of course  Japan China russia and india have all had close videos and photos of Apollo missions landing sites  China i recall particularly on there 2nd mission to close orbit of moon to do some mapping made sure they held the cameras on" sea of tranquility" the first landing site hoping that nothing was there so they could say " see usa is lying"  They went very quiet however as the lunar lander base the rover and its  tracks and several bags of rubbish all very visible  Russia and india also have their archives of apollo Landings videos and photos .... I dont think theres anyone who truly believes we didnt go today. It's attention seeking these days  .
I guess Scarlet needs to get paid more money again. Always complaining she’s a girl for some reason. 😅
Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts.
Watched it today with a friend. Smth that promised to be just another cheesy comedy turned out to be a very nice family movie. Really liked it and left with a pleasant aftertaste. Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous and fun as always :) Also loved that it gives an option to both conspiracy theory lovers and true loyalists - pretty much for you to decide. Very nice movie.
Any smoking in movie as in real live ❤?
2 hours and 14 minutes? What
Love how after "3,2,1..." we don't know if it's "Lift-off" or "Action!"
It's not just moon touching that is fake news. Lie-ruses, aliens, gayplagues, atom splitting, nooks, 4th dimension, photons, quarks, space-time, god, godparticles, witches, yetis, supernatural, paranormal.
Rockets are real, Apollo is real.....  all the low orbit stuff is real, unmanned stuff is real but no country has EVER 1) left the biome 2) touched the moon. IE: gone beyond the Outer Limits of the biome, aka going more than 300 Miles out. I'm 85, they announced the "landing" after 3 hours, but IRL it would have taken 3 days to arrive. Leaving the earth's Biome and staying alive is not a thing, it is on the list of Scientifically Impossible. Kubrik filmed the so-called landings using new camera tech. Interviews with Astronauts on return have been analysed by Intelligence Community and deemed fake, they speak as though reciting a paragraph from a text book rather than speaking from personal experience, "the moon's garvity blah blah..." instead of "oh my!! when we thudded down, when i opened the hatch, when my foot was on the ladder, my heart was pounding" etc.
so glad i watched the trailer first.  aparently its a movie about that movie when they pretended to go to the moon
Song name?
Should've used the song somehow too 🤣🤣
Did they film fake footage for the Apollo missions?
When you have a political reason not a scientific one to do things, you start to do crazy shit.   They sent two astronaut to the space station and still can't get them back!!
❤
Just watched it. Found it very entertaining and sweet. Just loved Scarletts character!
I would subscribe just to see this. I would give a Moon Landing denier a free subscription to see this...but, then, he'd just say it was faked...
My name is jeff
this actually looks funny
❤
Usually I don't find western movies funny apart from few laughs here and there, but this was really a clever and funny movie. Really liked every bit of it!
and May The Power of DiCaprio Memes.... Begin.
It's very good movie.
I was waiting for the song😔
How in the hell did this cost $100 million? Its going to one of the biggest bombs of all time.
Love this movie, Scarlett never let us down.💗
Just saw this movie and we LOVED it. So much fun, great writing , great acting, great characters, quotable lines. Killer soundtrack.
So NASA, a government ran organization with several thousand employees, apparently not only faked Apollo 11, but Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 too? Did they also “fake” the “successful failure” of Apollo 13 as well? What was the point of doing that? I believe that we haven’t been told the truth about many things, including 9/11, and the JFK assassination, and I’m up for almost every “conspiracy theory”, but we’re giving the federal government too much credit when it’s claimed that they could pull off something as massive as all those moon landings.
When I saw the title I honestly thought it was a biopic about Frank Sinatra not a movie about a conspiracy theory.
I just saw this today. I loved it. Pretty predictable in some ways. But quite enjoyable. Nice clean movie. Family friendly.
Celebrating the romance of space 🌌🚀... Once again!  Till they killed it with GPS and precision guidance strikes!
The teacher on Interstellar was right, not!
Question  Why has there been no moon landings since then ? Trying to pass the Van Alan Belt for a start
are we just gonna ignore that was directed by the creator of the Arrowverse
Hey, look!   It's a new movie with WHITE actors in the lead roles.  A rarity in the woke diversity crappiness of 2024.
Saw this today. Channing Tatum wears two shirts the entire film and they're both short sleeve mock neck shirts, while all his subordinates are wearing ties with collared shirts. WHAT?
This stinks of, feminist hollywood wo3 saying look at me Im at Nasa doing Nasa important stuff during Nasa moon time. Dumb wo3😂
Extrem guter Film 🍿 würde ich empfehlen
DEAN?
They are finally telling us
THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY, ALSO IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR NUTCASES TO TEACH KIDS LIES, SHAME ON HOLLYWOOD MAKING THIS FARCE 😡😤😡😤😡😤😡😤😡😤😡😤😡 WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
I still believe fake landing on the moon😮i just watched the movie
I want to see that movie it’s a good one
Looks very White to me!
Great movie 🍿 highly recommend ❤ summer of ‘69 🎉
😮
Why do you all comment on things? Please answer.
Only space movie in last 10 years I am gonna watch...guess why
❤
❤
Love the comments of the people who seriously think mankind went to the moon lol. They do this in hollywood ALL THE TIME. Show us truths and play em off so jack asses like most in here can act superior to others.
This movie has already been made. It’s called moonwalkers you’re welcome.
How’s this not a rip off of  moonwalkers
❤
Finally the truth comes out
Awful. Walked out. Save your damn money!
Absolutely great film. Very enjoyable to watch
❤
Paging all you alex Jones fans.
Yawn.
How ridiculous.
adorei
Put like who loved the film. Write and share why if willing to ❤❤❤
To the conspiracy theorists please keep in mind that this movie is loosely based on real events. This is a rom-com afterall,,,
What a stupid film
😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Few weeks ago I saw Channing in She's the Man 😂😂😂
And now they are confessing through movies
A masterpiece.
just watched this tonight and when i got home there was a black cat in my yard that ran away when i saw them lol (makes sense after you watch the movie)
💥 Kubrick 💥
I like this movie - worth seeing.
flat earthers waiting for the movie
Just watched it! 10/10 sooo good!
In real life; This movie is a comedy. In the life of flat Earthers; This is a documentary, lol.
Dropped from a C5 when the capsule "returned" to the pickup spot near an aircraft carrier.
So they admitting it was fake....without admitting it was fake.

"When I'm done, these men will be bigger than the Beatles."  Yeah, John Lennon said he was bigger than Jesus, and he got shot in the face.
Ppl actually believe the men have been to the moon?
This certainly doesn’t make the “fake” moon landing conspiracy theorists sound crazy after all.
Such a creative story line - loved this movie ... great casting. Definitely a must-see!
Loved this fun and funny movie. Saw it twice!
Impossible to land on something that isn't solid and impossible to exit the dome. They brainwashed humanity for a whole century. That's just 1% of all the lies they hide, welcome to the real! If you want to be free , research AdamicHope and Stergios
Capricorn One remake
No way Channing can get away with playing someone in the 60s. He has the face of someone who knows what an iPhone is.
Fly Me to the Moon is unlike any movie I’ve seen before. This film is well directed, with moments of slow burn and action, and has a strong backstory. It pays homage to a very memorable historical event whilst being heart-warming and suspenseful. Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!😊
Now why would someone have the idea to make a movie like this hmmmmm
Guy A: Dude, the moon landing was real. Guy B: Dude, it was a friggin' cover up. Sony Pictures: Dudes, what if BOTH were true?
We still want Russia to lose... 😂
I was an extra in this.. awesome project to be on!! Crazy to see myself in the trailer. Cant wait to watch it this weekend!!!!
Looks entertaining going to see it today
Like if you've had enough of these cookie cutter trailers. Pause at the end, someone falls down, snarky comment from the star of the movie.  Outtro music. Every. Single. Time.
GOOD MOVIE 😇🤌🔮
Watch the documentary ‘Astronauts Gone Wild’ if you wanna see the profanity laced defensive reactions and bizarre behavior of freemasonic astronauts with guilty consciences.
Has anyone actually seen this , I've watched several crap movies in a row and not sure I can be bothering to go see it 🤔
Great !! I can't! wait to see this ! A camp film every summer is a cultural must . Long live camp films !!
Reminds me of the movie Capricorn 1.
Song name ?
0:38 Why does it sound like his words were cut together.  Actually most of Woody's lines sound like that.
Seems like Apple does not understand that you don;t get clouds of suspended dust, smoke when on the Moon in a vacuum...if that't the best they got...then not worth watching///|\\\\
My only question is, if the moon landing was fake, then why did the Soviets just accepted it? It was their biggest loss whatsoever. By that time they have been involved in cold war and space war with US for decades. Why would the Soviets just accept it if it was fake? because they would be the first one to know.
Y’all 💩ed all over the original song  🤦🏻‍♂️
NASA the great deceiver
I’d love to read the excuses…IF we honestly put men on the moon, WHY haven’t we done it again, “at all”, these past 50 + years? Was it just a one & done? If they were so successful to do it in 1969, technology advancements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years later and “still” no men landing on moon. If anyone believes it happened in 69’ I have some oceanfront mineral rich organic farm land with wild unicorns for sale.
My name is jeff 😂
Hollyweird trying to cash in on what almost everyone already believes. They'll mess it up just like they always do. Hollyweird is finished and jumping on board with the very popular conspiracy culture won't save them. And no doubt it will somehow serve as some kind of propaganda at some point and time. Woody Harrelson makes it a bit interesting but  it will still be a hard pass for me.
Earth is flat and no 1 has been to the moon
This will Bomb.
They are finally admitting it in a backhanded way
I am invited to that movie and I hate it
Now make a movie about Flat Earth while you're at it 🤷🏻‍♂️
UGG, Apple keeps on making these bad subpar made for TV movies and then putting them out in theaters and they’re so bad… I know Apple has a lot of money but this is a really good way to kill his studio to keep on making shitty lifetime equivalent movies and then trying to put them out in movie theaters…doesn’t matter how many stars you hire, bad writing is bad writing and Apple has messed up so badly on so many shows and movies already…the movie seemed interesting. Too bad the quality will be Apple quality, so very sub-par.
Kinda pathetic they have to add a Token guy so it won't be an all White cast.
Scarlett*checks box* nice Channing . . . . . .   Look, I'm not saying hes bad or anything, he's great in The Eagle  but I can't say I'd see a film because he's in it. Scarlett on the other hand . . . . . .
(((Hollywood))) trying to destroy the greateat acheivement of Europeans and call it a hoax.
Man i would loved to of been a fly on the wall when the gave this the green light😂😂
‘Moonwalkwalkers’ 2015 was the same premise about Kubrick but still worth a watch 👍🏻
NASA would never fly three 6'7" - 375 lb astronaut,s they would waste millions and millions of gallons of fuel.  More belivable, three 5' 7" 135 lb astronauts, but Scarlett Johansson would never give them the time of day. lol
Maybe this will keep the Nastards away.
this "conspiracy theory" was written for 5 year olds. the only realistic part about it is Woody Harrelson. Let's see a 25 year old TODAY with the technology TODAY send any kind of video live from the moon. is this really the best Langley could come up with? I guess they have the data and determined they're not insulting their audience's intelligence. and Scarlett Johansson has the audacity to claim she doesn't believe in any conspiracy theories after portraying an advertising director. this film was far from ballsy, Wuthering Heights is more edgy.
I was in this movie. I bit off my own hand. Tasted like carrot
they should make a movie about how theyre going to have to fake it again in a few years too..
I'm watching this movie for ANNA GARCIA.
I went to the Kennedy space Centre in Florida and got to meet one of the astronauts and went on a tour. So it’s cool seeing the building and everything that they have in the movie.
Back up plan just in case?
These type of films are very dangerous to make even as a comedy.  The facts are well known and documented.  Even making fun of those who risked their lives, we actually list three in case anyone forgot, is a disgrace.
Have the people who made this film EVER SEEEN "Capricorn One"??!!!
Thats what happened...maybe
We went to the moon ppl, the hard part is getting off earth, we do that all the time, in space, let’s say you your floating in space and you got a ball next to you, if you push that ball at 1mph away from you that ball will move at 1mph forever through space until it hits something, and that works with anything, so once that rocket is in space it doesn’t need fuel to move, it will just not stop moving, until you need to change trajectory fuel is not needed, so it’s like throwing something in the air hard enough to where it can escape earths gravity and aiming it to where the moon will meet it at a point, it’s something we did, now if we can make nuclear bombs and power I know we can make it to the moon cause nuclear is more impossible to me than making it to the moon. And we did that too.
Not the Russians, the soviets
Hhhhh now they're using Hollywood to say to the world we've been to the moon but we made a video of it to make you believe our big lie ?? ...which niel  Armstrong who landed on the moon ..hhhhh
Looks crap
Now all you moon landing truthers can shut up lol y'all got your validation
Let the OLD debate BEGIN.
A variation of Capricorn one
HAHAHA watch the 1969 video of the going back of the moonlander attaching back to the "ship" then you can tell if its fake or not.   Spoiler. Sudden stops in the void of the space, explain that.
Moon landing didn’t happen.  This is based on a true story..
Reminds me of Wag the Dog.
This looks fun! Also, happy Scarlett is getting some top billing after her stint at Marvel. She’s wonderful.
Sorry hollywood vampires, but making a movie about what actually happened and trying to pass it off as being something cool and admirable just doesn't quite cut the mustard. You bastards realize that you can't fool anyone any longer, so now you're trying to just make a movie to try to make it seem like it was the "right thing to do" to fake the entire moon landings but the least thing you could have done to honor the dead was to show how the CIA and NASA murdered Gus Grissom and the other two Mercury astronauts because they were going to go public with the absurdity of trying to go to the moon in 1969.    There is nothing "cool" at all about this movie, it is just a shameful pandering to try to subliminally propagandize and brainwash people into thinking that faking the moon landings was the right thing to do and pretty cool and admirable that they got away with it and fooled most of the world.... it was a sick and disgusting misuse of power and just goes to show how far the government and the people controlling it will stoop to using our own tax dollars to carry out their chicanery and murdering national heroes at the same time it's not so much the actors but the producers behind all of this these people are ghouls of the lowest order and serve a different master then the rest of us or at least most of us. The irony of all this is it did not even fool the primary target of this scam which was the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Brezhnev and his clan found out fairly quickly it was all a fraud and used it as extortion to get the grain deal out of Nixon because their people were going hungry at that time due to severe droughts.  Forward 50 more years still do a movie about 9/11 and how the CIA and the Mossad wired the buildings for demolition brought them down to terrorize all of us Americans into thinking we were attacked by Muslims thereby justifying the pentagon's planned invasion of several Middle Eastern countries to take control of the oil supply which they were losing their grip on because all those leaders no longer wanted to sell oil utilizing the petrodollar... well, it's going to be really hard for them to make it seem like it was the right thing to do and a really cool thing cremating alive 3,000 americans. Yeah, that's when they're going to have to really work hard to come up with something to justify that atrocity but give them some time they're good at these things that's why they still have gotten away with it 25 years later, but hopefully not for too much longer. The sad thing is most of the guys responsible for that will be dead pretty soon most of them already passed; Rumsfeld, Bush and all the CIA and Mossad operatives ("dancing Israelis", ect...) and many of the planners of the "operation" are pushing up daisies unfortunately, so they will only see Justice on the other side...
I like astronaut Buzz Aldrins response to a conspiracy nut that was harassing him several years ago. He punched him in the mouth.
Looks like a bomb!
The put shit lik this out nd its still hard for some to believe
I love the fake walk!
This looks like a movie that really didn't need to be made. I bet it bombs.
Dónde están los terraplanistas??
WISCONSIN FOR TRUMP24..... WATCH THE BALLOT BOXES
Trailer Song?
If this isn’t true, then why haven’t we gone back to the moon ever since?
As funny as this movie could be, the whole concept is dragged down knowing that there are far too many stupid people who will think that this is some kind of secret conspiratorial admission of guilt. Guess what, we did go to the moon a bunch of times. Every major space agency on earth has publicly available images showing the current state of the apollo landing sites. But the conspiracy theorists will never be convinced.
Moonwalkers already did this. Great movie!
I hate it when they use a 1972 song to illustrate 1968 or something
How much are the sycophants in the comments being paid?
The timing of this movie is such a comically desperate attempt to silence skeptics. Nobody cares about what comes out of Hollywood anymore.
If the Americans had landed on the moon the Russians would’ve also done it by now and planted a bigger flag next to theirs. Wake up.
Loved it .. well put together and the right amount of humour and sorrow
It's the "Capricorn One" for the twenties generation!. Talk about "in yer face"...this looks like it could be a blast this movie!.
02:10 Rubbish effects  You do not get clouds of smoke snd dust on the Moon...No atmosphere ..no billowing !
"Movies Based on a True Story"
Whoa. Did they just admit that the moon landing was fake?
I remember when they filmed the scenes at KSC under the title Project Artemis. A bunch of props like 1960's vehicles were staged outside the VAB. It took them a few days to complete the photography there. I am only learning about the release now. So much for the marketing campaign...
This isn't helping!     Fuel for nut jobs.
🌊👁️🗣️🫵🏽🪡
To all conspiracy theorists:  did we fake the other 5 successful moon landings also? Adjust your tinfoil.
Conspiracy theories comes from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcissists are cynical, paranoid, and delusional, and cannot imagine any other way of thinking but their own, so they project their dysfunction onto everybody else and falsely accuse others of being like them. Narcissists are fake and entirely focused on superficial image. They don't care about being the real deal. All they care about is giving the impression of being the real deal to convince themselves and everybody else that they are the grandiose image they fabricate of themselves in their minds to compensate for the crippling insecurity that they are worthless and inadequate. They are actors and liars. And they believe everybody else is faking like they do and nobody is genuine. They can't understand real accomplishment. So when they accuse NASA of being so obsessed with image that they would sooner lie about making it to the moon than admit if they had failed, it is a projection of what they would do in such a situation out of their complete failure of character. Narcissism is the truest definition of insanity, they are the worst people in the world and the source of a vast majority of our personal and societal problems, like normalizing their insanity as they do with major motion pictures presenting their toxic ideas as truth.
why do they shove woody harrelson in everything?
Remember the real truth is always hidden in plain sight but masked with hollywood deception no one have went to the moon NASA is tje biggest Freemasonic Sun Worshiping Cult fraud no one can get through the firmament above the waters above where the sun the moon and constellations are(in water) no one leaves the earth alive in their physical body
I dunno if they are mocking us; or mocking our mocking of us; or mocking of our mocking of our mockery. All I know is: Scarlett's last line at the end of this trailer has made me LOL more than anything for years. Each time I see it, it does it to me again. I daresay the film will be a let-down, but at least we'll all have that last two seconds FOREVER xx
Just  watched the  film      makes  you  think  was it real?
The anachronistic dialogue got on my nerves.
"We should've gotten Kubrick!" 😄😄👍
This looks awful.  Was this made for conspiracy theorists?
So they made Capricorn One into a ron-com....
Woman were so ugly back then, perfe t part for Scarlett 😂😂
I worked on this set, cleaning toilets, scarlet kept hitting on me, so I had to quit... they told me I was supposed to wait until the said actress was done using the toilet,
The Earth is flat, stationery and the firmament is impenetrable... Genesis
Moonwalkers with Rupert grunt did this already and is 100xs better than this slop 😂😂
Amazing movie-----I am going to go watch it again. Thank you, Cinemark, for playing an advanced screening last night.
Google is the new film based on fact of even google can't get it right loosely based😂😂😂
I'm hoping they have ella  Fitzgerald Song fly me to the moon.And let me sing upon a  star  .Let's me wot life is like on  jupiter ands mars ..please be true ..... Another website I love you❤😂😂😂😂🎉
tell the truth after 55 yr
Just saw an early release, was pretty damn good. History was spot on.
Finally, an honest movie.
So is Matt Walsh and Daily Wire gonna lead a boycott campaign against this movie? LOL.............
cool..the truth in film or..: why they (NASA) stop the moonflights in 1972 ?
Love it: "Wag the Dog" meets the Moon. Perfect for our current upside down world🙃
Some conspiracy theorist came up with this bull.
3, 2, 1, we have liftoff! Somethings fishy here.. I smell moon rocks, and they're not the meteor type that I'd like in my stomach.
*HEY!* How come YT did not recommend this ?  Ah the *hard* thing to do: faking in movies.  Moondoggle: The Forgotten Opposition to the Apollo Program  For most of our lunar adventure, a majority of Americans did not support going to the moon. On the 50th anniversary of JFK’s “We choose to go the moon” speech, we excavate this forgotten opposition. By Alexis C. Madrigal
Im gonna join yhe bandwagon here and  say "I was an 'extra' in this film" 😂 seems like i see this comment more often than not in the comment section of movie trailers here on YouTube.. even on music videos! 😂
Loo😂
Fitting time in history to have this movie pop up. Try’s to be on the fence. “Capricorn One” will always be better than this. R.E.M’s “Man on the moon” is another favourite.
They missed the part where it goes based on a true story, lol.
Will Kubrick perform in CGI?
A trailer should make you want to see the movie: it just looks like a confused mess. I'll stick with Hidden Figures, Capricorn 1 and Apollo 13. Shame: I hoped it would be worth a trip to the cinema.
This is a documentary.
We all know the moon landing was faked. This movie is just lol’s
does anyone know what song was used at 1:49?
Heart Racing!
We didn't go to the moon people. Just look into it. The only way i could see them doing it was with some drone, and they didn't have that technology then. Nasa astronaught Dom Petit "We would go to the moon in a nano second, but we destroyed that technology and its a painful process to build it back" 🙃 Nasa is a massive corporation that makes a ton of money on CGI images whilst lauching there rockets into the bermuda triangle. Im not mad tbh, its funny to me that people haven't figured this out yet. I think most of the people that still believe are the same ones that "trust the science"😂
"We should've gotten kubrick"........you did! 😂
The 'white man who couldn't jump' will be in on faking one giant leap for mankind.
THANK YOU❤
The harsh reality is man is a greedy possessive creature and if he ever made it to the moon he would have never stopped going just like anywhere else man has successfully traveled. Stop and think about that 🤔.
I know we went to da moon i saw it on tv
If anyone wants to visit the real moon landing site its in Nevada.
Thought this was going to be good but it's shit
I watched this early and gotta say, its a wonderful movie.
I hope go to moon in the future
The moon landing is the most obvious deception in modern history. Youre legitimately overdosing on boomer brain if you still blindly believe we landed on the moon once the first try 60 years ago and then never went back again and lost all the telemetry data. Youre dumb. If you believe it youre dumb.
Nixon actually had a back up speech if the Astronauts failed to be able to leave the moon after landing.  In it he would call them hero's whose lasting grave would be the moon.  Fortunately, they managed to blast off after landing on the moon and made it back to Earth.
The Year of the Columbia Comeback
Based on a true story
I think they may very well have had a backup plan if they couldn't get everything to work. This makes more sense than it was faked. 😊
I saw Buzz Aldrin speak for an hour here in NZ🇳🇿 in 2010 about his experience ON the Moon and in space.. Neil Armstrong said it would be harder to fake than to succeed... the Moon Hoax is nonsense🚀
Little known fact:  no one went to the moon.
Where’s the black lady from the other movie
First Don't look up, now Fly me to the moon, there is a portion of the population that has no idea its being openly mocked, and that makes it even funnier. Can't wait for the flat earth movie.
I’m assuming the movie is going for a lighthearted “what if” take on the conspiracy theory of the moon landing being faked…the problem is that this movie is just going to validate all the tinfoil hat loons who actually believe in that BS.
Hollywood is grifting the flat earth conspiracy loons, and i love it!!
Are any of these comments about the movie itself or about tbe moon? Focus people
REMEMBER: The Department of Defense (DoD) has the final say on which films, related to any government agency of interest, are approved for wide release in theaters. They "let" this one get through. What does that say?
WTF Scarlett Johansson should not be playing some old lady from the 60s and Channing Tatum is not believable as an astronaut... horrible casting 🤢🤮
These two are going to end up cheating with each other.
This looks like NASA meets Madmen.
Big bird 🤘
is cinema finally back ?
just like media and government for over 4 years said Bidens fine, sharp as a tack and a genius president. 4 years later : uhhh Biden seems to have cognitive issues. BUT will make a great president for 2nd term. the moon land was faked. just like this movie is fake. a movie about it being fake is their way of admitting while gaslighting.
Okay, this looks okay… the title mislead me though, I thought maybe we were finally getting a frank Sinatra bio pic…you can’t tell me with his mob connections, all the famous women, the music, etc that his bio pic wouldn’t be one of the best.
If you really believe we went to the moon in the 60s and haven't been back then you're either a dumbass or a dumbass that believes in the US Gov't
Just watch Capricorn one !
Make movie on boeing
All the best sir and mam❤❤❤❤
This is a horrible fucking idea for a movie because enough people think the landing was faked because they're stupid. Fml.  Go watch Apollo 11: First Steps Edition (2019) instead. It's absolutely stunning.
This kind of movie shouldn't be encouraged tbh, in my country those ppl who saw this trailer in the cinema said "Oh so this movie is about how they faked the moon landing!"
The comment section make me an  Einstein xd flat earthers, space deniers, moon landing deniers xDD its so funny to read (and sad at the same time :( )
How the hell is categorizes the romance movie?
Saw it tonight. Much better than I thought it was gonna be. The audience laughed a lot. Should do well
Damn it I thought it would be a musical
Just saw this. Loved it. Hilarious.
Not them telling us they actually faked moon landing.  LOL 😆
Making the director a flamer is more forced acceptance.  If this guy showed up in 1969 he would have been beaten like a piñata
If people had a basic it literacy they'd know the impossibilty of faking moon physichs with the vfx tehnology of that day. No other arguement is needed. Then this movie would be fun. But with all the idiots out there I'm kind of mad they are doing this
So glad to see the Dean continued his director career
Im treating this as a soft confession.
Too bad she is a far leftwing P. O. S  liberal.  We dont go to movies with Trump hating liberals in them anymore.  Plus she dies at the end.
What a slap in the face to American history, how dare y'all call Neil Armstrong a liar, you need a tin foil hat to watch this movie, my ancestors watched the rocket go up and you're calling them a liar too, what a terrible movie
Why in the end the russian flag?  White Blu Red, 😂
True story.
It's a red pill 😂 ;)
Look boring lol
WHO TF thought this was a good idea 🤔 hmmm let me guess 👁️ ... divide & conquer
What will they think of next.
yikes
THIS is how its released we never went there and they blame it on fool the russians? FREEMASONS WILL BE LIAR FREEMASONS ALWAYS
o homem nunc foi a lua, e agora querem fazer um sistema reverso sei. Man never went to the moon, and now they want to create a reverse system.
As an amateur astronomer, and a fan of everything space related, this a movie I WILL DO NOT going to see (despite the good production and good actors on it)... This a derision, and a lack of respect to the efforts of thousands who worked (and still work) to enlighten the frontiers for humanity, through science and space. And above all, a huge lack of respect to those who died and risked their lives, in the effort of going to the moon. Well done Apple, keep going looking for money, no matter what. I'm a little ashamed to be a user of your products since 1985.
...Yeah, cuz everyone was a clown in the 60s too.
The truth wiil come out soon!!!! Jk lol
Capricorn One
This movie is unfortunate... Of course America went to the Moon.  It was all made possible by 3M. 3M Scotch Tape was used to haphazardly affix the faux gold foil to the Lunar Lander.   When 3M decided to focus on Endocrine Disruptor Forever Chemicals, their highly specialized Scotch Tape was in short supply.   NASA simply could not go back.
I never believed in the moon landing being a hoax until I talked to a guy who currently works at nasa who told me neither he, nor any of his colleagues believed we went to the moon. I thought that was pretty strange. Super smart guy. He said flat out "there's no way we went to the moon". He's apart of their new push to actually go to the moon, apparently.
2016 no war: "black women invented rockets boy sit down be humble" 2024 war coming: "white men did it, remember how great the 60s were? You can have it too if you die for israel" It's programming.
Looks like absolute shite
1:24 this is going to be good popcorn ready
On the same lines as the movie OPERATION AVALANCHE
If you believe ... rem..rhcp ..made in a hollywood basement...etc etc.  its all fake.
so is this considered a true story, or its still a conspiracy theory
So the filmmakers DO think the landing was faked, but are too chicken sh**t to say so outright.
Holy shit.  This looks great.
All you people who want to be in an echo chamber and think this is the truth, how much truth do you get out of hollywood? Just sit on that
Yes, everyone and his dog knows CBS filmed it in a studio incase they never made it. Yes they also actually landed on the moon. Yes they also signed waivers to pass through the van allen belt quickly. This is just Hollywood directors taking the piss out of the general public and laughing at people who pay to watch it!! I'm sure my comment will be deleted. They tend to do that lol.
I told my friends about the fake-landing and they laughed at me. Well... who has the last laugh now? LOL
Wasn't there a movie made in the 70s similar to this?? Faking the moon landing rings a bell...I just thought of it actually, Capricorn One in 1977...
This is blatantly telling us how they never went the moon a long with all the other lies throughout history.. wake up people Jesus is returning 🙏🏼
Capricorn II? 🤣😂
This finna be crazy 😂
Oh yay, im so excited to see this stupid conspiracy plastred ALL over the internet... again.... for the 100th time. Can hollywood really not think of anything better than shitty reboots or trying to appeal to REALLY dumb and played out discourse. Of course not because apparently, no one would watch it otherwise.
Why hasn't anyone gone "back" to the moon in the last 55 years?
Apple TV is for the Woke
And I’m sure that China paid for this movie
Truth drop
I accept this as a disclosure !
Ahhhh Hollywood and the US government slowly getting the general public ready for the big announcement. Is it art imitating life or the other way around...either way I see you!
The movie Moonwalkers did it first and better. This is just lazy story telling
Yup, it's official.  Hollywood has run out of ideas.
This movie already exists it's called operation avalanche
Love how Scarlett delivers the Kubrick line 😂.
is it really a good time to put out this sort of movie? lol
Finally ...por fin ..
Make it joke now before it becomes a reality
Predictive programming
which one? :)
Since people are waking up to the fake moon landing they also have to cover up the fact that Russia and the United States and all the other Elite countries in the world are operating together to reduce their burdensome human population numbers resulting from their massive parasitic economic boom and bust creating economic system that wants collapsed they are unable to support their populations in our Force to reduce them with war and soft strategies..... this is just another ploy to conceal the nature of the relationship between all the elites of the world..... because I guarantee you Russia was also in on this fake moon landing because Van Allen met with Russian scientists and they agreed there's no way they can get through the radiation belt without getting fried to a crisp.... it was only later when Nassau told them to reverse their findings did they do that but we're not able to support their own initial claim which is backed by all the science..... they merely just stated yes we can go to the Moon LMAO too bad most of you don't read enough to understand most of your reality is one big giant lie or maybe you're just comfortable with that reality because coming to terms with the fact that reality has all been engineered has a terrible effect on the human psyche the one main thing that comes to mind is an immediate identity crisis and nobody wants to go through that LMAO it's just easy to dye your hair and or to get a convertible red Corvette..... isn't that folks?? Most people don't have the cojones to face reality
I thought this was a horror movie. I'm disappointed...
finally - real history
This will definitely be a good one...
How else could they tell us? It's not like they can just come out and admit it.
why couldn’t they stick with chris evan’s being the lead😭😭
Graet;  give the loonies more ammo.  Even if there are a bunch of goofs in the trailer.
nice to see channing tatum in movies again 😄
W
Mining the spirit of Doris Day and one of many movie beaus. Looks like fun, certainly bonkers.
And just like that the faked moon landing goes from nutty conspiracy theory to taken for granted.
It is official now they will need to supress this movie as Conspiracy Theory. Fun Fact: one of the biggest spreaders of real Disinformation campaigns: the Pentagon and the intelligence services like the CIA, but also the FBI as they now are in fact an intelligence gathering agency. j
Wtf I thought this was a Frank Sinatra movie
Наконец-то документалочка подъехала.
I give them credit...I only saw one black person in mission control. I figured they'd have a lot more
There's a great mockumentary about faking the moon landing called "Operation Avalanche.' Definitely worth a watch if this interests you.
It was actually Elvis in the space suit
What a lot of crap!! The same histories all the time ... nothing new!! ... Dear Scarlett Johansson you are a movie star don't go for the low and easy... Love you!
What in the he'll are you guys doing. The fact that you are even hinting at the moon landing being faked is travesty and disrespectful.
Ahh yes, placing a man on the moon. Humanities's greatest achievement that can only be pulled off with 1960's technology and never again.
At this point the elites are just playing with us
I'm so happy and excited about this movie, my husband is invested in the moonlanding. He saw it on TV, you know!  HAHAHAHAHA!
Too many DEI alarms going off for me to be interested.
Not such a great idea to make into a movie, this is only going to feed the moon landing conspiracy theorists even more
Channing Tatum face cannot express any emotion in this trailer
God damn it Hollywood, you're going to be hyping up the psuedoscience charlatans now and give them ideas for more shit starting fictions because you named the damn fictional moon landing hoax Artemis! What the hell are they thinking?   That's it, I may not like you but get on it Elon, every single freaking one of us needs to go up there until ALL of us KNOW beyond the absolute shadow of a doubt.
It was easier to get to the moon than it would have been to fake it back then. Lmao
Is Dustin Hoffman and Deniro in this one too?
Based on a true story.
Anti American horse shit disguised as “comedy”.
The goal is so you don't know what to believe about pretty much anything.  Division-Chaos-Confusion
There goes American pride. Shame on Sony even helping make this. Happen to be a family member here to one of the astronauts. I know most family members have passed away so it’s safe to make fun of the astronauts who gave pride to USA. During that time they where hero’s not a clown like this movie makes them to be. If anyone has a negative opinion about what I said you’re not an American.
What is the song being played here?
This is not cool to make up a story about NASA making a fake moon landing to the moon.Its making fun of the real moon landing and a real Hero Neil Armstrong a family member of mine. Making fun of a dangerous event not cool.
I liked this movie when it was called Capricorn One.
THE DEAN
Operation Avalanche?
what is the name of the song that you can hear in the background at 1:35
60 years ago: eight years from Kennedy’s speech to landing a man on the moon. Today: after decades of effort, NASA is still at least a decade away from landing a man on the moon. The moon missions were faked.
The fact that NASA is still at least a decade away from repeating what they supposedly easily accomplished multiple times almost 60 years ago should convince anyone the moon missions were faked.
Don’t need Hollywood to convince me the moon landing was fake as shit
Channing Tatum playing someone that works for NASA is hilarious, it’s not supposed to be but it is lol
They is just to ease us into the ole…….. Well we faked it to boost national moral.
Ah I see they're finally making the documentary about the moon landing.   Far more realistic than NASA apparently being too stupid and accidentally setting fire to all their moon rocket technology and they were also apparently too stupid to ever make back up files. Then apparently they're even more stupid and can't replicate the technology despite the technology back then was so outdated, it can't even power up a playstation 1, let alone modern technology.
There are two circular objects in the sky. One during the day and one at night. The rest is just hearsay.
This movie is in line with the book “Apollo 11 - The Real Story”.
I worked rescue and recovery for the space shuttle for 21 years as a PJ with USAF Pararescue teams for over 30 launches and landings.  It’s VERY possible to get people back from space.
make a film about SpaceX and Elon next
I don't care what anyone says the moon landings were not staged in some back lot or sound stage in Hollywood or in Nasa
Use me as a "Dislike button", since YouTube hides the dislike form regular users.  Sony/Apple/ColumbiaPictures surfing on the Q-Anon conspiracy gives them visibility that they should never have. Shame on them.
0:50 - The omega speedmaster is a popular watch because it went to the moon. As the moon landing was a hoax, is it hinting that it was a marketing ploy that omega played on it customers and tricked them into buying the expensive watch? The watch never went to the moon.
So this movie will make conspiracy theorists feel validated and at the same time tear apart everything we rooted for since 1967, as well as objectify the very people who had movies and biographies written about them and their experiences with being involved with nasa from the contractors to the femal calculators. I guess Hollywood won't be happy until they've turned everything upside down and inside out.
Well well well, what do we have here.
This movie will have lips moving for years to come. It won't argue for or against the "moon landings". That will be for the audience to decide. I see a sh*t storm coming. 🤣🤣🤣
More BS about  a BS dream!
Revisionist history by Gen Zero. Also, disses on the real astronauts.
“We need to fake it” 😂 That’s what he said.  Oh honey you just telling on yourselves now., When we knew. You put it out there Hollywood in 007 movie of how the moon landing was backstage movie lot and the Land Rover was not even on Mars 😂 and this movie had Sean Connery as the star 007 trying to get Specter. did you forget the 70’s movies you made? Guess so. Diamonds 💎 are Forever. 😉
Fundies are going to enjoy this
Yeah, we really didn't need this movie.  The 2 digit IQ types already need institutionalization...
this friggen movie is gonna be a lightning rod to all the flat earthers and fake moon landing conspiracy theorists thinking this is a documentary
Finally, they make a movie documentary about what really happened
Comms for comms aware people. Basically the usual.
Song - T REX - Get it on. 1971
What was the working title, "Magic Mike travels to the Moon."?! lol.. ( Imagine if Pony started to play in the background as he meets Scarlett the 2nd time in the trailer..) fyi: All leading astronauts have to become Masons to get on a mission.. go figure.
Soft disclosure.
see.
Waiting the AREA 51 is real movie probably in like 2 years with all this alien stuff coming out?
For those that don't get it, this is buttering you up for the inevitable admission by NASA that they didn't go.
insane - so insulting 😪  (some funny moments though)
This is like OJ’s book "i didnt do it but if i did, this is how i’d do it"
Is this film is releasing on India ?????
Trying to cover the tracks…. We know that the moon landing was fake.
Finally a movies that was based on theory now being made.  Feels bad for NASA but atleast they did what it takes to stop the War.
God, juat we needed, a hoaxer's wet dream. Looks funny but man, this should've come out in like 2011.
Glad that Hollywood finally made a documentary about the moon landings.
Shame on you for promoting conspiracy theories, all involved. really. just a big F U to all of you.
It would be nice if the lady were Jessica Chastain
OMG He flew 52 missions in Korea 🇰🇷  0:20   👨‍🚀👩‍🚀🧑‍🚀 Fly me to the 🌚
Seriously
Anybody seen the 1997 film "Wag The Dog" well.that was because of the conspuracy theories in regards to Kosovo being a Fake War to Distract from Moniica Lewinsky and the byllshit attempted impeachment of Bill Clinton. This is  like that only using the moon landing conspiracies
This is the most unpatriotic anti-American film I've ever seen in my life. Those were American Heros, all the hard work of scientists and diversity to prove we are the finest dynamic land of people in the world. There was an African American woman that received a medal for her mathematics without those calculations the landing wasn't possible. Astronauts actually died trying to prove this was possible. Wow...
Capricorn One anybody ?
Van Allen strikes again
Well there you go boys. We got the best confirmation on the "fake landing" theory so far  Covering it up with humor ain't gonna trivialize it 😆
Year of Aquarius ♒️ is amongst us
You actually are losing to the Russians that's why you are making so many propaganda movies.
I KNEW IT!!!!!!!!!! THEY CALLED ME CRAZY FOR 50 YEARS! I KNEW IT!!!!!!
I'm korean and the song in this trailer is so cool. I want to know the name of this Music. Anyone know this song name? 😢😢😢
Jesus that seems criminally harmless.
NASA recently wanted to “borrow” LUNAR ROCK SAMPLES from China!! Now we know WHY…..
Conspiracy Theorist PROVEN RIGHT ALL ALONG!! 🎉
crazy commenters... GO!!!
anna garcia????
So now everybody that's said it didn't happen.It's gonna come out.And say see I told you so
스칼렛 요한슨 너무 예쁘다...완전 사랑함...ㅎㅎ
Dark to Light
Seee I know it's flat 😂
Cuando llegara el dia en que hagan una película sobre EEUU secuestrando 4 aviones para obtener petróleo
A new film pushing the idiotic moon hoax "theory"? Seriously? Do we really want to be dumbing down today's youth further? What's next?: a movie that "teaches" the Holocaust was just a hoax?😮‍💨
Anna
Van Allen Belt... Mic 🎤 Drop
The moon landing was absolutely fake just look at it omg a blind person can see that it was faked.
Check out the fake Stanley Kubrick interview about the faked moon landing on @alieninfoo
Look up karma for karmic retribution
Very, VERY bad idea! Thanks Hollyweird for feeding the crazies with your crap. I'll go back to my science study. -_-
They always fake the fake to delude the truth. And this is a confirmation that Earth is great and flat. ,please  like my comment if you agree.
EARTH IS LEVEL....A LEVEL PLANE OF INERTIA...FE RULES..❤
I was one of the core engineers and I made the trailer! Can’t wait for it to come out
this film is gonna feed the crazies for yearsssss
cheakyyy
This is hollywoods subtle way of telling us the truth 😂 we’ve all known it was shit! The year after A Space Odyssey comes out. The most advanced space movie of its time. And we just happened to “land on the moon” a year later 💀 I think the fvck not…
Truth in plain sight.
I know it’s just a film but that’s the STUPIDEST PREMISE in terms of historical fiction I’ve ever seen. It was past impossible to fake the Moon landing. The serious acting is what made it terrifying than funny.
I can always remove my tinfoil hat anytime. But u cant remove those spike protein. 😂 Fake moon landing check Dangerous vak check Dude... you still believe your govt ? Its 2024.
Awesome another "jewvie" to distract you from the moon landing as actually being faked.  WHICH IT WAS!
Why? It's an insult! Film!
As it has been over 50 years, they are getting everyone acclimated with the fact that we never went. And in a few years, whether it be 1, 10 or 20, they will acknowledge the fact that they never went. You can watch the official press conference of Apollo 11 on the return of their trip. It is clear to see by the reactions and mannerisms of the astronauts that they did not go to the moon. Kubrick did r&d with 2001, and then the lackluster performance of the 69 mission. Which when scrutinized, it is easy to see the abnormalities with the original video and picture of the moon landing. This is why NASA had to destroy all of the original footage of said project.   Check out Capricorn one and room 237 the documentary as well as even toy story.
Completely missed an opportunity to use Sinatra's song. Goddamnit.
The moon landing conspiracy freaks always crack me up.  Putting the facts aside . . . arguably, there is a rationale for faking it -- once.  But why would they risk the discovery of the "hoax" six more times?    More on point, the movie looks like a good one.
Надпись в названи в цвет флага России. Ахах, это как с самолётами во Франции или так и было задумано?😂
NASA is scam
Looks interesting
And the Russians go ‘YES’!
I’ll pass on this one!
Name song?
Can't wail ?   Watch Capricorn One 1977  ...  Sure, we went to the Moon  ...  just not to Mars.   Good flick.
Not to be that kind of person but I kinda hope they change the title. Fly me to the moon is such a beautiful song and I just don’t see it fitting with this movie :/
So the moon landing was a hoax afterall well done Hollywood
Doing this movie is a terrible idea, it will give the ridiculous conspiracy theorist something to latch unto, even if its made stupidly obvious that it is a joke
I know they went to the moon. A few times.  I recall we were told it was made out of cheese.  As I recall 6 teams landed, searched.  No evidence of cheese was found.  We have never gone back.   Behold the POWER of Cheese!
Finally a fake landing!!!!
Movie comes out in July, 55 years after they did it the first time.
What is the song for this trailer?
I've heard people say Nasa faked the moon landing but this is ridiculous
When they say, "don't feed the trolls" they mean don't feed the trolls.  At least make a movie about Flat Earther's going to antarctica and being shot by bazooka penguins and sharks with "lazerbeams"
Movie: Is called "Fly Me To The Moon" Also movie: Doesn't use Frank Sinatra song  "My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
Well, it appears to be a comedy. Just like the Moon Landing conspiracy theory!
I know it! this is proof that moon landing is a fake!  Thank you Apple
The fact that they making this movie proves all rumors could be true
Sooner or later we can hope for a film that reveals the truth about the twin towers, Enrico Mattei, Moro, Falcone and Borsellino and all that the deepstate have hidden from us by foisting on us all the opposite of what actually happened etc etc etc etc
I'm soo excited for da new release but.. Chris evans was supposed to be in da film but.. Sadly he wasn't cut out for da part soo yea
Lamest comments ever.  Let the kids have fun.  I visited the set of 2001 in England and yes, shook Mr. Kubrick's hand.  Haven't washed it since.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - lol
Cold blooded
A lie need ten lies to patch up, and ten lies need one hundred lies to patch up.  It will get harder and harder to patch up.
HAHA now they are letting us know about this expensive fake moon landing SCAM!
Well Americans are very good at revisionist history.
Is Hollywood helping a damage control? We will have an answer if the Chinese land there in 2030 as planned.😅
Good😊
I'd only watch this movie because Jim Rash is directing the moon landing scene.
dont typecast, he is talented and i think it will be great, thats like looking at your boobs and freckles from a few yrs ago before we knew how brilliant you are.. I mean with much respect <3
NASA and Hollywood the marriage that has lasted a generation. 😂
This will be a blockbuster for the conspirationists and will skyrocketing in views as well... After this movie, every conspirationist will use the sentence " I told you so "....🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another flop for Apple
🙄
Can I talk to Scarlett Johansson if she's busy because talk about questions
I missed Channing
The most unrealilistic thing about this movie is Channing Tatum working for NASA.
Yet, the only watch that survived was a personal watch made by Bulova. All the other Omegas broke instantly.
This looks cute..
Just like the first moon landing movie, I’ll pass.
Hiding in Plain Sight, it's great to see the exposure of the fake moon landings. They never happened folks.
They are trying to MAKE IT OKAY that they have lied to us all these years and spent almost a TRILLION $ because it was the "space race" and we needed to beat the Russians. Misinformation at its finest.
I am appalled that the makers of this film decided to give credence to the moon landing hoax conspiracy theory.  Many viewers will assume this movie is the truth.  Is "truth" a word that you know?  Why on earth would you do this?  Needless to say, I will NEVER see this film.
Are they gonna smash in the movie?
Super down
They are just lucky there was a Corvette in the trailer because if there were no Corvettes in this movie I wasn’t gonna go and see it.
This looks tragic haha
Imagine making this movie and not having someone play Kubrick as the director. One shitty throwaway joke is not enough to sell me on this, this movie missed out hard.
A old man in my neighborhood swore they were faked years ago🤯🤯🤯
Finally we get to see a real documentary about the so called "moon landing"
This is about as believable as a movie about politicians destroying another country based on imaginary weapons of mass destruction, or fighting a 20 year war against a nation where the people dont even have shoes, in order to capture someone that wasn't even living there. Or better yet a global pandemic that lost effectiveness when it became politically convenient. These things could never happen, we are too smart for that...
A film by Abed Nadir
Dean waiting for a movie like this all my life.
Geez so many still BELIEVE we went to the Moon and yet can’t get there today hhhmmmm I wonder why Artemis & Orion can’t get off the ground and to the Moon that both projects have been scrapped again & again. Maaayybe cuz space and the Moon are impossible to reach and that the sun moon & stars are fixed in within the FIRMAMENT/DOME and move around us as we stand still here on the ground (just as we OBSERVE). Oh but that can’t be true it’s all just a “CONSPIRACY” 😜🤪
I just finished the JRE podcast about the moon landing being false and now I’m like kinda confused. Is it that obvious we never went to the moon??? I feel like it’s being put right in our faces. Forget about all the conspiratorial stuff and look at the big picture. One word, humiliation.
WHY OH WHY is be gripping a CONTROL YOKE in a P51?
Hollyweird showing yall the truth
Anyone here because of a meme?
NASA - Never A Straight Answer
Check out Moonwalkers from 2015 with Rupert Grint for something similar.
Oh, the Dean's in this?
Gaslighting to the extreme
Is that Stanley Tucci in an uncredited role??
Was staged
What a fu cking stupid concept for a movie. F uck you Hollywood!
Give the people what they want to see...
Sony not try to ruin every single aspect challenge : impossible
😂😂😂😂😂 OH AMERICA LAND OF THE FAKE😂😂😂😂
You know what I love? How Channing went from pretty dancing boy to legit powerhouse acting in more and more fine movies.
this b itch is SO OVERRATED,,,--hollyturd U WILL LOSE MORE $$$-,,HAHA
Yeah this is a great idea. Let’s make a fictional story about the moon landing but market it as a historical drama/romcom and give the conspiracy theorists something to latch onto to increase their delusion. And let’s throw in a Kubrick joke at the end for good measure. Sorry, but pass.
My best friend  is in this trailer. 😎😎
And then they say Hollywierd isn't a propaganda machine... Good luck trying to convince anyone with common sense that you could land on the Moon 10 times in the 60's with a 100% success rate and with rovers and even film it all with a huge presence of artificial light.
that Leo meme
I just know every conspiracy theorist is gonna take this as proof lmao
Okay ...what?!  This looks pretty good, try to heave back in those who said Hollywood is running out of ideas!
Americans staining american accomplishments to the trashcan
This movie happened after Google showed to Putin their new tech to analyze images, where they can detect if they are fake or not. Putin asked to submit the moon landing, and google AI gave the answer: it was fake, after that, they release a statement that, yes it was because they lost the footage. And now it's a movie about how the USA has some "arguments" about he lying. FK decadence is showing in every aspect.
can't believe they let this guy direct the moon lanDEAN
They made a movie with this exact premise in 2014 starring Ron Pearlman and Rupert Grint. Kinda wild nobody noticed. Even I don't remember that film's name.
I love how Americans randomly drop a national secret like; "What you gonna do about it?"
For anyone who has questions, I suggest watching ‘A funny thing happened on the way to the moon’, ‘American Moon’ or reading Bill Kaysing’s book. I also used to think only stupid people believed it was a hoax, but it is quite obvious once you look at the evidence yourself.
'Fly me to the Moon' was released in 2008 and super and unforgettable movie with nice music ( from Andhrapradesh)
Moon landing by NASA is truth ( from Andhrapradesh)
ask yourself how did they get that full size car the Moon rover!!! on the moon?? to drive around??? big wheels and all??? not to metion the Phone call from the PreZ to the astronouts  we have land lines that long???from the white house???? go look that silly sh*&%^% up!!! come on man enough of the bull!!! you know what killed the missions,??? playing golf on the moon!!! that did it!
was this movie not already made wit ron pearlman? lol
Capricorn One!
They admitted 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought it was TONIKAWA's live action😅
scarlett :)
Check out the movie called American Moon.  It kind of looks in that film that the Russians did not even want to attempt to go to the moon.
I know every moves off black woodo so i am not interested on you
Good movie..to bad it's only 2.5 minutes
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!
What’s the song in the trailer
So they filmed a movie, about a movie they filmed back in 1969
Biggest tax fraud, psychological operation, scientific hoax of all of human history. And it main organisation happens to be the hebrew word for decieve or lie.   Im tired of staying silent, these days i speak my mind regardless of blind ridicule.
The moon's a lie people. We all know its a piece of cheese
The “you’re on fire” gag needs to be retired from all film, forever
I’m going to tell my kids that this is a documentary.
I’m going to tell my kids that this is a documentary.
They had to do this eventually, it's been 55 years, every year it gets harder to believe in 69 someone walked in the moon
1:12, haha.
Conspiracy theorists 35-0
How many diferent versions of this topic will you gonna make
This is ridiculous...
So in the 60s NASA can deceive the world about going to the moon, and in the 2020s they can reveal how they deceived us. Which tells us we can't trust anything the media and the government tell us.
She looks like Taylor Swift. And Taylor is sending the soldiers into their planned graves, just like Marlene Dietrich did. Yes, it's so easy. She only has to wear a bathing suit, spreading her legs, and sing a little song. Remember, our leaders play with our minds. (And will always repeat themselves)
written and directed by Joe Rogan
Its literally been proven that it would have been more expensive to fake the moon landing than actually going to the moon, let alone the fact the technology required to do so didn't even exist back then! Why do people still promote this shit like its the gospel truth?
Could never get my head around Nixon calling the moon in 1969 from a landline in the White House office, with hardly any delay and no interference. I can’t get a good reception on my iPhone even with a cell tower at the bottom of my street! 😂
I think the movie title should be *“Space may be the Final Frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood Basement”.*
Fun fact; there was only ever a space race with Russia bc American communists, within Washington DC, sold Russia our secrets. Sound familiar, Hillary?
OH THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE BASED ON THAT BAYONETTA SONG! ❤
OJ Simpson would have loved to have been an extra in this!
About time they tell people that the moon landing was fake. It is too late everyone knows it's fake already sorry.
Another? Really?
I thought Channing tatum was Dustin Poirier in the thumbnail 😂
Cartels supplied the moon dust  :0)
Channing as an astronaut... I'll pass
Why is there so much contain with the title "Fly me to the moon"? I've watched an anime read a manga of this same title.
Cuándo va a salir angry bird 3 😢
DEAN!!!!
Thank God the good movies are back goodbye Marvel
Mah neym ih Jeff  -C. Tatum
Ngl I thought it was Poirier the moment I saw the thumbnail
I have had a feeling in the pit of my stomach for a long time that they faked it. Every time someone sends something to the moon and NASA makes sure they  stay away from the original landing sites because of their historical significance.  I really hope its real.
Okay does anyone know the name of the song that is playing in the background? It has been stuck in my head and I can’t find the name of it. 😭
Jeff and Black Widow??
Changing & Scarlett in one frame. This movie gonna be a blast💣
Its Wag The Dog for the moon landing. AWESOME
FENTON!
We all know Apollo mission was a fake
the dean back in the director chair i see
I never bought Apollo 11´s story.
Looks fun…basically a space version of Wag the Dog.
Scartlett never disappoints
Next movie will be about flat earth 😂
More propaganda
My name is jeff
Scarlett steals the Show ❤
I bet they used the same set too
Woke film
James Bond tried to tell us in the 1971 movie Diamonds are Forever when he stumbles upon the moon landing hoax movie set.
Now they’re shoving it in your face . Of course we never went to the Moon. Never got past the Van Allen radiation belt. NASA even did that lost the technology that took us there lol. Tin foil and toilet paper holders . 😅
Bang A Gong didn't come out until 1971.
Obviously none of this is real.
wich is the music playing background  0:20?
Nosotros todos chicos reentusiasmados mirando por TV y nuestro padre nos decía no sean crédulos "eso es todo puro biógrafo"si viviera nos diría "vieron,se los dije"🤭
Did I see Jim Rash? Sign me up.
Meh
1:41 - "This better not awaken anything in me..."   Only real ones would know
bwahaha "space"
Sad to see people still believe in the moon landing 😂
Planes are fake.
Dean!
booooooooo
The Earth is flat people, I can't wait for that movie 😅
I was hoping it would be a Sinatra biopic…sigh
I’m not reading all of the comments, but I’m assuming some of you have seen Capricorn one I think it’s free on YouTube. In that movie they fake a Mars Landing. That movie is actually good suspenseful and thought-provoking. I’m not going to spoil it anymore. This looks like a parody of Capricorn one. And it doesn’t even look funny. Ha ha.
I brought a deli tray to the set for this movie. Cant wait to see it!
Space may be the Frontier but it’s made in a Hollywood basement😂👍🏻
Its wouldve been harder to fake the moon landing than to just do it. Facts
This movie looks good ! Can’t wait to see it.
The moon light can light up the night sky and man can walk on the moon with that light. Nope. We never went to the moon folks
I wonder if you gave this fake moon landing footage in the film to AI if it would detect tampering like it did with the real “moon landing footage”.
Brilliant move by the controllers! Now when you research the real Fake Moon Landing you will only get information about this film. Walt Disney had his head frozen, but when you search “Disney Frozen” you get information about the film.
Did they shoot the fake moon landing in the film at Cannon AFB just like they did in real life?
Did Stanley Kubrick wear colorful vests? 😂
One day they will tell us what happen 911 and CO*ID too .. Media is not telling you truth now but later maybe...
Oh get over it... US people and their ego with the moon landing, real or fake, who f*cking cares!
*based off true story
This and Civil War!!!! 2024 is gonna be lit😂😂😂
am just gonna sit here for the mayhem now
the Earth is Flat, motherfuckers...

страхолюдина йохансон опять в качестве роковухи
This looks way more believable than the first time they faked it. Cgi is way better today.
I must watch the movie, how they fake the histori..... So no one have been go to the moon?
Scarlett Johansson = yes Im going to see this movie.
nasa= hollywood= scientology...  all fiction
Looks like Hollywood can only afford B rated movies now!   😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😏🤣😂🤣
We aren't going anywhere.
Not A Space Agency
Too many people are on to it now, so this is damage control with reverse psychology. Can't wait to watch it.
Some of ya'll seriously cannot be helped. A few of you think this movie supports the conspiracy theory that the first Moon landing was faked. This movie clearly shows the story of the back up plan to make a film of a "landing" to show the global public (and the USSR) that the US did land on the Moon but it was unnecessary because the Moon landing actually happened. It's right there in the trailer.
Alright bro!
So Channing Tatum still acts?
Why wouldn't they wait an extra week to release this so the movie would come out on the day the moon landing allegedly occurred?
This look soooo good!
Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson in the same film? This is the collabo we needed all along.
Actually nobody went to the moon….  The USA government went to the SUN… at night.  NASA( Not All Suckers Pray) 🌚
Всем ЗДРАВИЯ! Если честно, снято красиво, но полнейшая ЧУШЬ и ГАЛИМАТЬЯ! ! !
Imagine having a movie named Fly Me to the Moon and not using the song in the trailer lol.
Can’t help but compare it for all mankind
Scarlett is about to become the darling of yet another lunatic fringe.  MCU being  the first.❤ 😅
There are so many excellent actors  out there today,  but Scarlett is a genuine  Movie Star. If she's in it I go see it.
Looks like this is the funny big budget version of Operation Avalanche lol I also find it interesting that Scarlett Johanson is doing two moon landing movies; this one and Project Artemis.
Two of my favourite artists ❤
Scarlett is on fire. 🔥😂
Propaganda, pure propaganda.  LIES and deceptions galore.
Fake moon landing ? Okay i gonna watch it
TRUTH is right in your face people! But Americans are so blind & programmed.   WE HAVE NEVER GONE TO THE MOON! It’s all a script! A fake.
Hahah they aren’t even trying to hide it anymore folks…wake up it’s an actual fact
You absolutely cannot leave the firmament!
Are they gonna go in the robot?
It's kinds like if we did fake the moon missions this is how it would a  went.
Anna Garcia!!!
People who BELIEVE we been to the moon are going to have a fucking field day with this one, they think this is their "Gotcha" moment 😂
Beautiful actors together 👏👏👏💯 love 🤩 gorgeous Chan 👏👏🥰 love you ❤
except you didnt land there
Why does this trailer seem to be missing the “based on true events” line??
I am soo tired of being right.
This is a conspiracy to say it was a conspiracy.   Those damn Illuminati they ruin *EVERY*thing
What’s the 2nd song in this trailer?
As great of a movie as this looks, ngl I was kind of disappointed after seeing the title that this wasn't a origin story of Frank Sinatra
A real life documentary
I knew it!
I just find it funny that people still believe we went to the moon lmfaooo   You are telling me that the we are able to transmit a video footage from the moon back down to earth in real time in 1969 but yet till this very day our cell phones barely work and if you have direct tv you barely get a connection  lmao but yet we broadcasted the moon landing on everyone’s tv GTFOOH 😂
Fake moon landing as a BACKUP PLAN to avoid Humiliation is what cracks me up.. 🤣
Lmao 😂To the people that thought we really went to the moon..... Hears the facts you all been waiting for. Your welcome lol
They ain’t ready 🍾 🤣
They are just trolling at this point now lol.
Thank God we had a back up…
"They" now want to earn millions extra from us from this new film, because what “they” have stolen over the decades is not enough for them?!!!   …SERIOUSLY?!!!    ...but ...but, why are "they" telling about it now?!!!  Is it because “they” know that "they" have been defeated?!!!  Trillions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted, blown away for decades, and landing in privet pockets.  Today "they" humorously talk about it in this film as if nothing had actually happened so that we can more easily swallow "their" crimes against our humanity?!!
the only real moon landing i know is the one between jay and cam
People will watch it and say "it's a joke". 😂 can't wait for the Titanic documentary 😂😂😂.
This is hilarious. So obviously a stab at conspiracy theorists while those same conspiracy theorists will say "SEE THAT'S PROGRAMMING THEY ARE PREPARING US FOR WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUT!!!!|
I was expecting at least a few seconds they will play the song 😂
I can't believe so many of you are caught up in conspiracy denial! 😂
Finally they confessed
I think any denier who could see a launch in person would probably break down. The hole they could never fill would be evaporated.
True story?
Wag the **** dog Kubrick wag the **** dog Ron D Moore all mankind **** up in this **** lol
Eu acho que isso tem um pouco de verdade,Por que eles nunca mais voltaram pra lua
Parece ser Bom,tomara que vocês não errem
i thought this was snl 😂
Androgynous actors are so talented!
Nasa is propaganda, nothing else.
Used to wonder why they never took people back to the moon 😂😂
Dostum bu filmi seveceğimden %100 eminim
where is Colombo
This is just a remake of the movie made in the 70s with OJ Simpson and others. The real rocket explodes on take off. The actors all look at each other and say we're all dead. I think only OJ survived.
Scarlett and Channing❤❤❤
Latin: Sci enti fic = English: Know that it is fiction, according to Google translate 😂
I believe we went to the moon but this trailer did make me think that it would be an interesting theory if they DID have a back up plan incase the real mission went south
omg scarlett
Looks really good
I dunno with the atomic age / 1960s / space race era, but the aesthetics is just 🔥
Nice :)
Only Hollywood could put the truth out in such a manner as to make it obvious. Free Masonry Witchcraft. Simples !! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
interesting
Looking for Chris Evans 😢
Channing ❤️
That dude that bet his friend a million dollars the moon landing was fake ten years ago is now sitting in his jacuzzi laughing and realizing he was right all along
Something about the trailer makes u want to watch is again and again.
My name's Jeff...
Plz sony aka idios, don't screw up Spider-Man 4, let marvel do their thing
This seems interesting
I CANNOT FREAKING WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
For anyone who doubts the moon missions, I challenge you to read or listen to the “air to ground” radio transcripts recorded from these flights. Apollo 17’s, for example, is 2,461 pages, or 302 hours, of pure, unscripted and non-directed (for you Kubrick nuts) audio, from launch to splashdown. Should be a good weekend read. If, at that point, you still believe in the hoax, then there’s nothing anyone can do to help you 🤷‍♂️
Wasn't there an animated movie from 2008 with the same name as this?  Except that one was about flies going to the moon!  Although tbf, nobody's ever watched it... and stayed sane. lol
Told you so
I have the inkling they are portraying the set up moon expedition but its definitely the other way around 😊
They did history a disservice by changing the Director from *Stanley Kubrick,* _who actually filmed the original "Moon Landings."_
No sé si la película será buena...  pero este trailer es excelente!
We never went to the moon and the earth is flat! I'll watch this fantasy of a movie like all other movies. I can appreciate good writing.
Kelly Jones and Cole lmao
Ahhh the programming in this is laughable 😊
But what do you mean?the moon landing was fake?hhh.
Sarina Hilario
*Best part “I think, we should have gotten Kubrick” 🤣🤣🤣*
Just fess up and admit it! You asses never effing made it to the moon!!!!
My favorite actor, Channing Tatum
0:07 Stop, drop,and roll” had not been introduced yet by the NFPA. The Learn not to burn curriculum was introduced in the early ‘70s.
💀
Lol is Nasa finally confessing with this new movie..
The way my dumbass thought this was an adaptation from the game to the moon
So it was fake?
No offense, but this looks like a TV movie
Dean Pelton? I'm sold!
Scarlett is looking beautiful in this one!
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon.
Predictive programming.  Nothing new here.  Anyone with an ounce of common sense knows no man has ever set foot on the moon.   It was always a lie.   Looks like a lame movie. I won’t be wasting my time.  😊
big LOL
Finally some real ahh story
Calling it now. The plot twist will be that Johansson's character is a russian spy turning double agent.
Billy Bat plot but comedy
They are rubbing it in your face, basically admitting they never went to the moon 😂
The fakest thing in this film is the idea that a guy like Tatum would be smart enough to be an astronaut.
Mükemmel video çok beğendim süper
Film Cox beyendim super ela
Can't wait to watch/hear Joe Rogan on his podcast about this.  This is like an indirect admission that nope we did not go to the moon?
they sure do make tatum stand out from every other person in every scene. that guy has a different coloted shirt from everyone else every time..weird for a movie about a guy who doesmt know how to market, advertise, or stand out
Anyone knows the name of song playing in the background?
R33333t4444rd3333d
Whaatt....nooo....nooooooooo
See i told you they faked it!
this is EXCITING!!! JOHANSSON and TATUM❤❤❤
They tell us that truth is stranger than fiction.  That being the case, this movie just went full tilt.  Houston, we have a problem!  😳
Sell the moon landing. And that's exactly what they did!
But no Nasa and Tsukasa.
Jo Hanson got you
Well I told you kids has a new meaning now lol
Waiting hindi version
My name is jeff
It might look as a comedy movie but I believe that the MOON WALK never happened. Look at the movie GRAVITY 🤔 it was TOTALLY made in a STUDIO FOR 200 million dollars ( if I’m not wrong ) and NASA gets BILLIONS of $$$$ 🥶 and HOLLYWOOD was a cheap thing to fool people.
The fake moonwalk can only be told through the medium of film. And then they said it! Opinion formation also takes place through film production and the time is now, it has to be out, to save their asses.
Remember when stars could bring the audience to the cinema with just their name? Haha good times.
Movie version of For Mankind.
1:06  Scarlett J and Channing T reminds me of Kirk and Carol Marcus in Star Trek Into The Darkness due to the color of their outfits. 😂
this looks like such a fun movie cant wait to see it
who else clicked on this thinking that it's gonna be frank sinatra's biopic
We've all seen the Dean direct before, why do we think it's gonna go any better this time?
Who actually has apple tv to even watch this
It feels unusual to see Scarlett in such indie films even though she came in Asteroid City. "I think we should've gotten Kubrick" with Scarlett's voice and face was funny. And **cues **_fly me to the moon_** (Neon Genesis Evanglion ending)** 2:50am 15.4.2024
Poor scriptwriting. It’s impossible she would not notice the fire, and he wouldn’t have said she was on fire.
They are preparing the people for the lie obviously
More nonsense for the masses of asses. They keep pushing back so hard the more people continue to wakey, wakey, from dream world! Little too late, dudes, go watch Capricorn One, it's the original and much better.
CIA Propaganda!!!! Drop a movie gaslighting the idea that the moon landing was fake, but have it be a message saying its silly to believe its fake. Nice try Hollywierd
If you believe the official story of the moon landing then I don't know what to tell you .All I have to say is how did they make it past the Van Allen Belt?
See, I told you so!!!
In reality there _was_ actually “fake footage” filmed… except not by NASA.  Some of the TV news stations filmed a bunch of stuff with puppets in order to have something visual to broadcast in case the live feed didn’t work.
?
They hide it in play sight. They function by a universal law where they have to disclose what they are doing for silent consent and good karma.
This is during the 1960s.... the song is from 1970 to 71'
Damage control.
Super
Horrible
Very good film
Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication *Space may be the final frontier, but it was made in a Hollywood basement*

Ohh F*ck... about time!!
Moon landing was real. Do you think for a second the government would ever lie to you?
Is this the remake of the first movie??.. gonna watch it for real
Fiction or non fiction?
Kingsman in MCU confirmed 😅
The movie "Operation Avalanche" from 2016 shows how they would fake the moon landing... the things made so much sense that I was like "dammmm" during the whole movie! Highly recommend!
It’s comedic how more people are willing to believe we didn’t land on the moon based on a 2 minute trailer of a fictional romcom than of the thousands of pages of radio communications, spacecraft telemetry, videos, photos, science and technology of the real missions. If that doesn’t make you sad for humanity, I don’t know what does!
Channing’s Oscar is overdue
Disclosure to dump jobs program 😂
All you “normies” get ready for a peek at the truth, cuz it’s coming! 😎
OH MY GOOODNESSS!!!!!! 😍😍😍 one of my fave songs and two of my fave actors!!
Flop
Now this will feed every moon conspiracy.
Sounds like OJ Simpsons ," if I did it then here is how "
Something I didn't know I needed!! 😂😂
This looks pretty bad. I will wait for reviews for sure
Dean!!
Yes!!!!!!
WOW!!! THE MOCKING IS REAL!!!
This is unique - you have both perspectives of someone who is planning the moon landing and someone who wants to fake it for help in publicity and marketing. Usually, in movies, it's either one or the other.
Ooo this seems fun
Public disclosure. We never went to the moon.
What a film. Can't wait.
Hollywood has no idea how to make a good movie anymore....
Ok, im suprised ....suprised that hollywood actually put out a movie that i want to see , streaming of course
Im waiting for people so say: i told you so😂😂😂
scarlet johansson, yeah thats enough of a reason to watch this
Don't do me like this US Government
Mission Mangal ❤
This looks terrible.
It has a fun feel, similar to Catch Me If You Can.
nice!
Conspiracy theorists are about to have a field day. This movie is about to break bank.
Came here for Sinatra, stayed for Kubrick
I thought it was a musical movie...
Nice... show the truth in plain sight.  Nice Hollywood showmanship!
Was she drinking gasoline?
They cast chaning Tatum as an astronaut.
we got a movie about fake moon landing before GTA 6!!!!!
space is fake
Ya la quiero ver 😊
Excellent cover up.
Space is fake and ghey. Wake up folks
Apple Tv is really fascinated with the Moon, are they cooking something there??
Finally something looks good
Only scarlett
I really hope people doesnt misconcept this, it all comedy but for sure would end up in wrong perspective
I hope everyone understands why Hollywood is so adamant about making shows about the Apollo missions being faked. They were the crowning scientific achievement of the United States and the narrative that it was a giant conspiracy is part of the continuing attempt to undermine our democracy. Everyone who had anything to do with this should be ashamed.
Only Physics fiction theories can send you to the moon and bring you back. I never believed this joke ever . And people who made up the "theory of conspiracy" are the same doing it
Finally the truth is coming out 😂
Who in this putrefaction world may still believe into the bullshits US movies ? This is just an industrial media making programs to make people stupid... remember the sequence into "Mecanic orange" of Kubrick showing the principal actor sticked in an armchair in front of a serie of bizard pictures full of violence... It is exactly what the cine makes to the human brain !
Holly shi channing tatum and scarlet johanson less fucking gooo
"Lie Me To The Moon"
That's a pretty funny premise.  I do not, however, envy the small army of NASA officials that will have to repeat the phrase, "Fly Me To The Moon is not based on real events" a few hundred times when this comes out.
Y el desnudo de Scarlett?
I spy... a new space movie with Apollo related content! c: Ok, just watching the scenery and visuals they have of the Apollo program they got my attention. I’m really interested to see this, and also an interesting story for it.
Looks so very white.
If this doesn't actully play the song in the movie I'm rioting on the street
Truth is America never reached the moon chapwa
Tell me the moon landing was faked & now a movie's being made about it w/o telling me.
They tell us the truth finally! 😂
I think the point is that a backup was filmed just in case, but never used due to the successful moon landing? Looks like a brilliant premise- I’m in!
For some reason i always see scarlet carrying some files 😂
Faking a moon landing would have been more expensive than actually flying to the moon.
Some people do not begrudge the USA the success of sending the first men to the moon.
This looks hilarious😅😂🤣
And you indeed lost to the Russians lol
What song is it in the beginning ?
Finnebassen
Wait, are you telling me Channing Tatum is playing Frank Sinatra?! I know he's a dope dancer, but can he sing? 😮   Edit: Ok, I've watched the trailer. 😅
Nope
now this is the space movie i'm interested in watching!!!
A haha 🤣 this is spectacular 🤣🤣🤣
Still no mention of anti gravity or the trb3 astro? Not even the outside help who took us there in the 1930's? Public is too trusting.
inverts in space...can't wait
This movie should have been released after the upcoming cancellation of the Artemis program. So bad we lost 60's technologies
Its like….. “In your face.” Lol 2:31
`So when do they make a movie about China that created the virus in 2019?
Now this , I’m excited for
😂🤣😂
Ohhh god. The crazies are gonna LOVE this conspiracy garbage. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Lol. KUBRICK was the guy who shot the fake moon landing....
Channing tatum and Sandra bullock had awesome chemistry I'm so excited to see how the chemistry with scarlett johansson and channing tatum will be be❤❤❤😊
Is this predictive programming?
revelation of the method
They both look so good together 😍🔥 they should Get married!!!
The only thing that makes me skeptical at times is how they did a live feed of the moon back then. And today when we go to the moon our live feed has problems and can't work.
1:36 One small step for dean, one giant step for deankind.
Wow ❤
With all the current technology and all the budget and they have not been able to go to the moon, there are still people who believe fifty years ago they landed on the moon.
Pour la version comique : on ne peut pas retourner sur la lune, on a perdu la technologie 🤡
booooo
I hope this movie is a giant bomb - they lost me at the faking of the moon landing.
Capricorn One
True ❤ Black Widow
I bet they make it to the moon so they don't have to "fake it."
I always knew that Americans didn't land on the moon... that's the proof 😂😂
I just know Dean is gonna re shoot everything a 100 times and go over budget and then Luis Guzman is gonna come and give him a pep talk and Abed is gonna finish the shoot 😂
In other words, this is a documentary. 😐
No way they made movie about "america biggest lie"
Black Widow and Gambit
Bad casting. Great script.
And that's how they confuse people 😂
Song name @ “0:37”?
Flat earther having orgasm right now
Clever way to get us to believe that the fake was fake.  Hmmmmm
I m a simple man, i c channing tatum and scarlett , i click
Wake up people ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Red Hot Chili Peppers… Californication
NASA is making Chutiya of Everyone we Need Russian and China to Tame West and Europe.
This is so awesome!! I am so excited for this movie!
Reminds us of Capricorn 1. 😊
Looks great
Being an Indian, I always envy the liberty they got in Hollywood to write, shoot and release a movie without any chaos. No matter who they're plotting it against or what the conspiracy is!
Check - Operation Avalanche C.I.A - Matthew Johnson 1967  it was nothing but post-war propaganda, pre-war propaganda, it's just a well-made joke that caught on with the limited mind, the united states is the biggest liar on planet earth, they started all the wars in the world, they didn't allow any freedom and they only sell illusions!
Still some people believe that americans apollo mission was real... Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fascinating.
Ey good to see the Dean from community 😂 ❤
😍😍🥰🥰🤩🤩
Dean Pelton's directorial debut
So it is true....we never went to the moon. A whole new level of fake it till you make it
I think we should have gotten Kubrick 😂😂😂
Trillions and Trillions of our own Tax dollors for God know how long they been stealing from the American People these low life liers!
Interestingly, this is the 2nd film about Apollo 11 with this title. Fly Me to the Moon is a 2008 animated science fiction comedy film about three flies who stowaway aboard Apollo 11 and travel to the Moon.
great job on not editing out the flag and nasa meatball on the VAB.
I wonder if they put this movie out to just let everybody know they did fake it
"we should have got kubrick" sold me
Flat earthers going to love this movie..
DON'T FAKE THE MISSION SCARLETT!!!
“Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement.” Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication
Apple really loves space/the moon lol
Nice to see a normal film with no message or meaning.. good cast. Looks enjoyable.
The people are easily fooled. Who can telephone the moon on a landline?
There’s something about scarlet voice that’s so soothing , and theatrical
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
They did! 😂They did get Kubrick 😂😂!!!
Deny. Deny. Deny. Of course.  Predictable.
Our mind are the battlefield. Psychology not trying to understand and cure but instead manipulation at high level.
Flat earthers will call this a documentary😆
When the conspiracy theory becomes loud and clear, but new generation must accept it from Hollywood, that try this comedy. Try something about Israel. Lol. The Jesuit mafia rules the world.
Limited hangout?
Is the music in the first part of the video - the rolling stones?
Flat earthers are gonna eat this up and I would know…. Flat mother fuckin power!!!
This is set in '68 or '69, I assume? Yet the first usage of the phrase "stop, drop, and roll" for putting out a fire didn't occur until 1973.
What a strong independent woman!
Space may be the final frontier but it’s made in a Hollywood basement
This is offensive.
Kubrick... 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂 you all think this is fake 😂😂 they are telling you to your face and your sitting back laughing…it’s like OJ, “If I did it….THIS is how”
🤣
It's time to be a Astronaut
When will you release the venom 3 trailer??
Looks spectacular ! 😀💖🤗
Bro I’m soooo tired of the divisive methods. A spark in FE vs Globe debate again while mocking us 🙄
Just a little history refresher: USSR first Satellite in space 1957 Animal in space 1957 Man in space 1961 Woman in space 1963 Spacewalk 1965 Lunar landing 1966 First human lunar landing 1969,…USA Which started their space program a decade after the USSR. So “Yes”, it seems so plausible that we were the first (& ONLY) country to put humans on the surface of the moon! Hahaha
A big step for lies and money spent in spades and no step for a large part of humanity who are dying of hunger and thirst and don't care if Man plants his damn flag on the Moon or Mars! The Great Step for Humanity is on Earth, we are still waiting for it.
Ooooonooo😂

Capricorn One: Part Two?
Globe sheep going crazy in the comment section , notice the nasa agents all over! The masses are not worthy of fighting for …. I bet within two years they will all be chipped like cattle .
Ayyyyy Ray's here!  Ah-ha-hahhhhh! ✊🏻✊🏻
This is a very well-done trailer! It will bring back the old discussion about humans going to the moon. The fact that we have not been able to go back 50 years after the first landing with all the technology that we have now is confronting. NASA lost crucial information as well as the original film of the landing: this is also embarrassing. I still want to believe it was real, though, but it becomes harder as time goes by.
Fake moonlanding propaganda for helioasexuals.
Damn. And it won't be banned by government. Wow.
We are mot going to the moon
Scarlet JoDisney
July can’t come fast enough for me! Ray Romano is such a heart throb ❤
Sony i think its time to release the venom 3 trailer i cant wait any longer🍿
This movie seems to be simply a mockery. Do you believe? Lol question is.... what do you believe? ( rhetorical)
just MORE mud in the water...space doesn't exist the way we're told, so the "did we go" question is irrelevant, the firmament will attest to that !!!
Ohhhh ok 😆😆😆🙄🐑🐑
“See?! Why would they make a movie about it if it wasn’t true!!”  (Loosely) Based on actual conversations about events that (more than likely probably didn’t) actually happen
After I saw all the footage of the “Actornots” in the ISS and how NASA uses harnesses, wires, green screens and computer animation to deceive the masses that they are in space, I completely understood why no one has ever been on the moon 🌙🤙🏼
Californication
It's easier to keep someone fooled than it is for them to admit that they have been fooled 🎑
"Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement" ~ Red Hot Chili Peppers, 1999. We know we've never been to the moon, and now Hollywood is even trolling us.
American rocket/space nerds are gonna get p!ssed about this🤣...LOL I can't wait for this
RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS NASA IS IN THE BASEMENT
We said it!!!!!!!
So it was faked?? Damn.
They had me at, “I think we should’ve gotten Kubrick”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stanley Kubrick is that you?????
Guess we can safely say the moon landing is un-dean-lievable.
How is it horribly edited in just the first 6 seconds already?!
Incoming fake moon landing conspiracists “…More proof they faked it! They’re mocking those who say it’s fake!”
bro this movie mean that they will release the bio weapon that you probably inject in your body aint no way they tell you the truth like that
Real quick: How many here actually think this is a secret documentary or a NASA confession?
wtf is that😅
interesting
Interesting.
We knew, now they're recognizing it...
Song name?
Finally they are doing a sequel to Capricorn One
1:37 Dean Dean everyone
scarlett jewhansson
When will we get the release date of spider man beyond the spider verse?
Scarlett Johansson 🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol this is just Operation Avalanche...
I have zero doubt this happened
Four times in this movie trailer things are shown on fire. Are they making a joke out of the Apollo 1 tragedy?
as someone who loves space and exploration i can say i have no problem with a spoof movie it looks great also how well written
This movie is your full disclosure - > we never actually went to the moon. Yes, normies, it was really faked back in the 60s.
I was an extra in this!!! The set was awesome and meeting Scarlett and Channing was totally amazing. Looking forward to it!!!
Wow I cant believe the scene I was in as an extra made it to the trailer!!! Cant wait to see the finished film!!!
people don't like to think they just repeat what they saw on the internet   we know nasa lied to us or hide  many truth but the real question is did they really go to the moon?   short answer, we don't know...and we shouldn't care, you know why because all of you who wake up every day and play the world stage game, you keep feeding it every single day    eating junk food, watching sport, watching this dumb movie for exemple and many more   and the worst of the worst is feeding this agenda   ALL THE ANSWER ARE WITHIN YOU
This is smart 🤠 actually to give us an insider movie of the moon landing and how they faked it because the true mission failed (fact)
Next year they'll release "fly me back to the moon". Supposed to take place in 2025's. And still a vaporproject.
I believe they went and faked it. So hard to say though because of that little radiation belt around the planet that we can’t pass through without dying. Even with current technology that we have. Well, so they say.
I wish people knew how to act. Every movie trailer these days is full of stupid dialog delivered like a pile of wet cement. This is not frothy or fun. It's dumb. So disappointing!  P.S. the costumes are really yuck.  I don't enjoy feeling like I am being sold nostalgia on the cheap.  Figure it out, Hollywood! You are spending way too much money on dreck like this!!!
Looks amazing ❤❤❤❤❤
Nasa is just a big fat hoax don’t wanna believe that’s fine keep being a mental slave to them 👏🏻
Anyone who thinks we've been to the moon is an idiot. Read your Bibles people
Soft disclosure? Damage control?
Was that Dean Pelton?!
The fact that … they did HAVE Stanley Kubrick but he died because of his admission to filming and faking the moon landing and exposing the the secret society of Hollywood is wild for « Hollywood » movie to make a joke about him.
Love it! Finally some truth about the fake moon landings 😎 I’ll 100% be going to see this 🔥
It doesn't matter if they tell you the truth through myth or fiction, if they show it and you still don't believe it - that's on you.   Wait until you guys find out what they've been programming the populace with.
WOKISM: just how BADLY will you F--K this one up too... -
Scvarlet, the first 'man' on the moon...
SCARJO!!!!
Now that's a trailer
im down whenever i see jeff in a movies😂
A similar premise was used in a movie called "Capricorn One".  But that was a action thriller.  Underrated.  Worth a watch.
Finally, the conspiracy community get their story told
Any movie that does a fake conspiracy angle to the moon landing is a no for me.
1:32 Lady teacher in Interstellar was right ....
FINALLY THE TRUTH
This looks aggressively stupid - high profile actors being dreadfully miscast. A concept that seems like it's AI-generated. The whole shtick is washed out. Willing to bet the only interesting part of this film will be Jim Rash
They don't make historical fiction/non-fiction like they used to... sigh*
i don't like how they're going to shoehorn a romance into what would be an exellent drama/comedy on it's own; but, it looks ok. the only movie i ever really like johansson in  was "ghostworld"..........and i STILL think thora birch was the better actress.
"If you believed they put a man on the moon Man on the moon"  - REM
I thought it was a Frank Sinatra movie
Already watched this ... in reality...  For more watch AMERICAN MOON by Massimo Mazzucco. Freely available here on youtube...
The whole moon landing thing is BS and everyone with common sense knows it. No way we went from sending people to the moon 60 years ago to people in 2024 needing safe spaces and gender-confused rehabilitation.
Scarlett is back ❤ looks a fun movie can’t wait!
Was that Stanley Kubrick?
Conspiracy confirmed
no thanks apple sucks
"I know lot more about moon than I know about you!" Ladies 😇
As someone who loved the Moonwalkers movie I'm Definitely interested in seeing there take on it 😁👍
malantaw gid ko sa cine yaaa! hays i miss you scarlett
Well judging by the wooden acting and the fact that i didn't make it through the trailer, I'll give this one a miss.
i want to go to the moon. travel to the space is like saying im travelling to a place that is out of this world.
That double take from Channing was such poor acting.
oppenheimer for women
They earned me with the fake moon landing part 😂 I was not expecting that.
The truth right in front of y’all faces again but y’all still believe we went to the moon 😂😂😂
matt johnson wants royalties
Peace be upon you. Believe in ALLAH (GOD) and the judgement day and do good deeds. Don't show non well covered women that will be better for you in this life and the heaerafter. Ladies cover your bodies that will be better for you in this life and the heaerafter.
Every conspiracy theorist just blew in their pants. Including the women.
this is amazing
If you want a (likely) better version of this movie, check out Operation Avalanche!
This looks like a proper satire
Is this a "what if" film???
I believe that no human has ever been to no damn moon liars!
ANNA GARCIAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
There is NO WAY we landed on a rock in the sky. CIA cold war smoke...
From the director of “Life as We Know It” & “Love, Simon”  The producer of “Aziz Ansari Live At Madison Square Garden” & “Beyonce: Lemonade”  The executive producer of “A Dog’s Way Home”, “Uncharted” & “Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile”
All the technology we have now compared to back then yeah we didn’t go to the moon lol
What's the music title
👍👍
If they don't use the song in the movie, it'll be painful.
Hah told you
Hope that is real moon landing, 🛬, not from fake one 😂😂😂
It’s about time
Scarlett looks are too bad in the film😢😢😢
My Evangelion brain just turned to orange soda and told me congratulations. I just wanted to hear the song, this is almost as bad as Halo not using the Halo music in the first trailer.
Who played neil armstrong
If we went To the moon in the 60’s, how come we never went back?
Scarlett is so fkn great at this type of comedic savagery. And there's no one more entertaining to watch take that beating than Channing Tatum. + Scarlett's hair is AWESOME 🔥💕
A TRUE HISTORY DOCUMENTARY
Scarlett looks good.
I’m not a moon landing denier, but this looks fun.😆
ANNA GARCIA!!!!!
They filmed parts of this where I work at actual NASA. You can almost see my office in some shots in the trailer
Jesus, stop giving the conspiracy nuts ammo.
THE DEAN IS BACK
People in 2024 still believe in 1960s Moon spacemen....?!?! Hahahahaha 😂
It's not a very original idea considering the movie Moonwalkers.
I wanna see a flat earth movie
What's the name of the song that appears in the trailer?
So it was a hoax all along 😮
As someone who is not 100% convinced by the Moon Landing footage being real, i'm super interested in watching this, plus i love ScarJo!
Watch Operation Avalanche instead
What's happened to Channing Tatum's face?
Black widow looking different these days
What are they trying to achieve with this movie? I don't get it. What's the point of showing that they're trying to fake it?
oof the conspiracy theorists are gonna have a field day with this one
"fly me to the moon" I heard of this before....
F' this piece of trite garbage. All eye's rolled on the floor at that Kubrick line🙄 Rose Gilroy should be ashamed to perpetuate these falsehoods that conspiracy nuts hold onto (fact or fiction, take a stance!). Byproduct of the Q' era. Sad. 👎
Love the last line 😂 long live Stanley Kubrick!
Let's gooo!!!🚬
Small thing i would have liked, have channing tatum's actor-double be john cena.
FASCINANT  trailer, bright Scarlett Johansson actor
It's sad and pathetic that the government has to lie about the moon landings and even sadder and more pathetic that they have to leave the comments below to try to support it. It's the Tom Cruise Reacher scene of making it "messier" to prevent any "messes" in the future but the reality is it is still a mess lol. No one can truly lie. So why? Are White people so weak and scared they have to do this? There is characteristic with a special name where Whites short-communicate since they have so much stolen wealth that any slight is interpreted as 6X more than reality -- a sort of pre-emptive strike. With their blond hair and white skin they stick out. Those who know this does not work are the good ones. So will this end? Never because we are all clones. But good always wins MORE because more than half of all people know to unplug.
Who else saw the title and thought Nasa and Tsukasa
1:39 who cares  let them shoot me.
Scarlett Johansson is reclaiming her Hollywood's queen status with this and the next Jurassic film.
They were surprised how Japan flew to the moon😂, while NASA are actors, astraounts 😂
Hahahahaha, do you think they landed on the moon - Jeff Kennedy remaking.
Sad to see chris getting replaced
اخيرا هذا الفلم انتظره من سنة و سكارليت هي الي تمثل 😍
We should have got Kubrick 🤣
Finally, the real truth.  The moon missions were cold war propaganda.  We have never been out of Earth orbit.
And the Beatles name is used again…KINGS 0:56
The number of moon landing believers is probably close to the number of believers in Jesus C. walking on the water and other miracles. No one could actually see it, only been told some stories and now Stories can be told through the movies, distributed through television. But, hey, we all like magic and flying broomsticks. Tell people otherwise, they'll kill you over their belief. I can't wait for this movie release date.
finally a true story, which actually tells you the reality.
So Scarlett will play Christopher Nolan filming the moon landing?
After Community series I can't take Jim Rash seriously 😂
Can't wait! Being an extra in this was awesome :)
Hmmmm… right in our faces
I wonder who was cast for Stanley Kubrick
Not even going to watch the trailer. Not a superhero/sci-fi film or a sequel or based on an existing well-known IP, and from a major Film Production Company? Yes, I’m in.
E Tão bom ver a scarlett johansson novamente
How come after all those years they have never gone back to the moon..😂😂 Can't wait to see this one. HERE WE GO
For anybody wondering what the song towards the end was its "eddie floyd - big bird"
There’s no way they are actually making a movie about the moon landing being fake?! 😨
0:57  There were no astronauts' faces on Rice Krispies boxes.  This is an homage to the faces on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes from the early Seventies.  My father created that campaign at Leo Burnett in Chicago, just a couple of years before he died of cancer.  I did the voiceover for an actor in a Rice Krispies commercial around that time.  The actor was Moosie Drier, who you might remember as the kid on Laugh-In.
It's great to see Dean Pelton embracing his?her?their?thor? directorial talents
Looks interesting but I'm confused what it's about is she a actor agent?
Oh the Dean is in this? Looks like he Britta'd things.
Haha I knew it
Is it a movie for conspiracy theorists? Oh no!!
Hope it flops...
holy moly shooting of fake landing
Seems like a channing Tatum comeback
Okay make a movie on Malaysia airways now.
I think it's great America no longer thinks she went to the Moon. If we can keep spreading these lies, I bet we could convince them that they are still part of the British Empire. King Charles II would be most pleased.
Que the idiots who think this is a true story.
i still think usa never went to moon
Missed the chance to use Frank Sinatra's Fly me to the moon. But heyy..🙌
… and this, ...is why you don't trust the government, … any questions???
so i was fucked from the beginning then.
Have you ever heard David Manning, Sony's Fake Film Critic who manipulated viewers' option on their movie....
Ah shoot…here we go again…
Woody Harrelson wasn't even officially cast in this - he just walked on set and figured this was the moon landing conspiracy treasure trove.
Exciting
Sony: Hey can we please make this true story?   NASA: I don't know...  'Sony shows millions of dollars in a check.'   Sony: We can allow you to make this movie. Just promise us they you won't say this is based on a true story.
Why does Tatum got to wear colourful tees in room full of white shirts ?
Hopefully it tells balanced fact without any manipulation from CIA and Mccarthyist agenda
Bloody fake America, never been to the moon ever. They can't in any century.
Far Left Factory Apple is replacing Soviet with Russian to fuel russophobia.
Its not a comedy
Conspiracy theorists gold mine 😂
Would love to see the 'Pitch Meeting' for this movie...Wow wow wow...did we land or not ??
0:17 Ouch...
Thought it's another Evangelion music video
ржачно, Татум всё ещё красавчик, ну и мы не можем пропустить русских, а давайте включим халливуууд))
They have to stop to cast that guy... there is so many great actors right there...But Tatum is definitely not a good one.
I saw Woody Harrelson and am in!!
I like Apple's taste in producing movies.
What's the song playing in the second half of the trailer
i love woody
I thought it's about that song
Channing Tatum might be the only buff actor that isn't going overboard. In fact, is he smaller?
Sony pictures multi dubbed this movie please 🥺
So excited to watch this
Looks good!! I wanna watch
So they're hiring a lady to fake the moon landing, when she can't even see that the book she's reading is on fire??? Give me a frigging break.
Finally!! It reveals
I mean... they like to "tell the truth" in movies... as they say... but then again there has been admittance of things lied about for 60 years recently and no one cares because the content is old... maybe it will be revealed that the landings were faked one day, and no one will care... might even admit the towers one day - who knows...
NASA when you fake the moon lading 😲
Bet they used the same sets from for all mankind lol this looks fun tho
Finally. A movie we really needed...
The only difference in cost between sending men to the moon and not sending them is the catering.
Me at 1:28 "Gentleman, you had my curiosity. But now you have my attention."
Why is Neil Armstrong driving a ~1967 Chevrolet Camaro? Where's his Corvette?
So reverse psychology huh? 😂
Wait.. so did this really happen? They made a back up just in case the real thing went to sh*t?
seems nice hope im right =d came from Apple website
I see two beautiful people I click!
Not even one black guy, i now have faith in this movie, where are the DEi cry mobs against this movie, this is sacriligious to to them.
american rubbish, pass
What a joke
Ray Romano Stans gather here!!!
So....they DID fake the moon mission......🙃
I love Channing Tatum so much
At Last Real Comedy and Scarlett Johansson is so Sexy and Wicked !
Plot twist: everyone realises that the landing is impossible to fake convincingly, and they go for real at the end of the movie.  Edit: Given how Scarlett Johansson appeared on the OFFICIAL NASA eclipse broadcast yesterday to promote the film, I think this is a definite possibility 😅
Hail Caesar And First Man Came Together.
It's bad enough that we have a Kids Next Door episode saying that the Moon Landing was faked, now we got a movie telling us this?
It's amazing to think of the technology used for the Apollo mission. Yet, after so many decades and much more advanced technologies that we possess, still no real progress in sending humans to the moon. Wonder where that technology went.
God channing is so miscast
I liked the part where they inserted a girl boss in a movie about the moon landing.
Hateful, lying bullshit that will just inflame the nuts.  Not funny and I will urge intelligent people not to pay money to see it.
Anyone else used to eat at Wolfie's in Miami?
Scarlett also looks good in the clothes of the 60s.
So is it based on a true story? LOL!
So they are saying " yeah there's a tape, but because we needed a backup?" What a bunch of liars.
Wag The Dog vibes.
Why does Hollywood keep selling us Channing Tatum. Terrible actor. Scarlet Johansson always great.
Capricorn One did it better. And that TRex song came out in '71.. womp womp
2:21 love this😂
I love this film already, but damn how stupid people can be to think that humans visiting moon is staged. There are about 3,000+ employees worked in the Moon landing operation and every single one of them needs to be "in on it" without a single leak that all of these is a sham. Even GTA V has more leaks than the moon landing controversy lmao
So you consolidated the conspiracy theory even the Kubrik joke
Can we say... "Limited Hangout?"🤔🙄
Hype for another SJ film
My aunt told my mom and dad that the so called moon landing was a hoax way back in the 1970 or so...SHE HAD AND STILL HAS DISCERNMENT🙏.
Sooo.. NASA admitted that they actually attempted to fly to the moon and also made a fake one?
They should really market this as “based on true events” because in a way, that’s true. 😉
This is an easy acting job for Scarlett. Easy money. She’s a dumb twit in real life too.
Dean dean dean
see I KNEW IT!!!
Scarlett and Channing. Yeah I will watch

.
Is this really set in 1960s?
Do you realize what you are about to do us... as a society.... I c'mon....
Truth in plain sight
I like the part where she goes “It’s mooning time” and proceeds to— okay I can’t 😂
Even a science mission needed marketing. The world is watching and learning a lot for America. And yes they will get better at whatever they are doing :)
I’ve been a fan of Channing since 21 Jump Street!
Outstanding news... Christ's blood, his death on the cross, releases us from the guilt of sin, accepting us as righteous in God's sight Colossians1:20 The cross shows the seriousness of our sin, it also shows God's immeasurable love. There's hope and salvation to all who put their trust in Jesus. Please think about it.
Sure they faked it 😂😂😂
Scarlett 🧡
Hey, conspiracy deniers, we didn't go to the moon, get over it.
Wow I might actually see this on the big screen
The dislike is from Tsukasa.
operation avalanche
I absolutely hate this!
Wtf is this.
I haven't seen this guy in a WHILE
So they made this movie to tell us that they didn’t go to the moon and we film it all here in the US smh…. These people are dumb!
At least they put that Kubrick joke in the end. I hope they give credit to the real director behind the moon landing shooting.
Another whole movie seen in a 2min trailer
She's so cute 🥰
Is that supposed to be Nikita Khrushchev at 1:24?? I’m Terrible with faces and I can’t even seem to google the correct answer. I don’t think he’s just supposed to be some generic Russian as it looks like they used computers to deepfake a face, but who is it supposed to be? There’s no mention online at all, as though he apparently wasn’t played by any actor and isn’t representing anyone specific. he’s just an AI face I guess and not even mentioned in the IMDb credits. Anyone better with history care to help me out? He sorta looks like Khrushchev, but not enough for me to be certain. Thanks if anyone is willing to fill me in
ANNA GARCIAAAAAAA
Saw it the FIRST time, when it was called, "Capricorn One."
Slanderous seditious treasonous propaganda so the United States should sue such filmmakers for financial compensation to pay off the national debt.
this looks dumb as hell
That  girl from smosh at the end lol
I see my guy channing and scarlet j😩 Instant watch lol
Alternate Title: "Girl Boss saves NASA"   I'm sure it'll make a mint, because ya know we don't have enough Girl Boss movies
"No one can ever know what we're doing." "I can not accept that." "They WILL shoot you." "What is my budget?"  LMFAO.
I’m convinced they’re trying to dumb our population down and turn each other on the other. This and “Civil War” are PATHETIC. Why even attempt to cause a stir. Garbage.
hmmm the 2nd film to propose a fake landing  Are they trying to tell us something?
Lmaoo the slow disclosure
🥰🥰🥰🥰
So this an entirely made up story about the Apollo missions… why?? Why not just tell a new angle on the actual story?  Or is it just not compelling if Scarjo isn’t in charge??
Channing is not a good actor, I don’t get how he still gets booked
while I believe the moon landings were real, this movie looks great!
I'M SO SICK OF THIS EVERY SINGLE GOOD MOVIE IS POSTING TRAILERS AND AT THE END IT SAYS in theatres May/June/July LIKE OMFG ARE GOOD MOVIES NOT ALLOWED TO COME OUT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THR HEAR OMFG LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE TRAILER STARTS SO GOOD AND THEN BOOM LIKE A THROAT PUNCH
Love a good non-fiction movie.
Dean Pelton is making his movie!
I'm waiting for scarlet and Chris to reunite, missed them both on the screens, though Channing looks handsome here🙂🙃
Stupid movies like this are doing nothing more but further spreading the moon landing conspiracies
So did they ACTUALLY go to the moon or was it really faked orrr…? I guess there’s no way to really know for sure is there.
Best documentary the world will ever see. This will open so many eyes.
Nice
It's "Lie Me To The Moon" with an added "F".
They actually did it! They made the moon hoax into a movie! I'm so watching this!
Soooo is this a true story or whaaaaa?!!!!!!!!🤔👀👀👀👀
Jim Rash!  Can't wait to see The Dean in this!!
They should call Nolan...his moon landings are craaaaazzzzzyyy!!!
Finally a mainstream media that's gonna expose and reveal the truth. This is definitely gonna be a controversial movie. Excited for this one. 😄👏🏻
0:21 No SONY ding before the torch lady?
So, this means we didn`t land in the moon.
Making this fictitious story to point more positively in the direction of the freaks who can't conceive of us actually going to the Moon is just fucked up.
So excited to see Anna Garcia getting a huge role in this!!!
Finally a movie based on the real event of “the moon landing”
This looks so fun
Just watch Operation Avalanche instead of this trash
Interesting day to release the trailer.
Please don't give conspiracy theories anymore ideas
Now that this is in the public domain, there will never be any convincing of the public that the moon landing happened
When did Darren Till become an actor
This is like a old classic
Wait what?. I thought this was is a Frank Sinatra Biopic.
Channing and Scarlett ❤
It's giving Hail, Caesar! And I'm for it!
Matt Johnson did it better.
well this isnt based on the anime
Fuckin garbage. You don't need to make up shit about NASA to make it interesting. NASA is TITS all on it's own.
Hey, I just got that as an ad! This Tarantino at it again? Same as _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ ? A dramatized version of the story that is untrue and never happened? A brief search revealed Tarantino IS NOT involved in this. So no guts in space, huh? Also are they presenting the "Moon landing is fake" as a fact? I mean I get it, with what came out about the US government and its agencies this past year, killing JFK, spying on citizens even more than anticipated... it wouldn't be out of the question, especially during the Cold War. But that is highly improbable. At least it will bump this movie's numbers, if anything.  xDDD
Every single conspiracy theorist is nutting their pants right now.
Love how this was posted the day of the eclipse!
This is a disgrace to everyone who was involved in the actual landing. It just gives deniers more ammunition, even if it is funny.
This is already a good movie called Moonwalkers with Rupert Grint and Ron Perlman. This could still be quite good, but I recommend people check that out too.
Oh its on apple. Ill see it in two to three years when its no longer on that platform. 😎
Oh look, The EVA song has gotten a movie adaptation-duck DHMIS
If Frank Sinatra's song is not in this movie I riot!
"let's take the greatest achievement of humanity which deserves the highest respect and make it into a tone-deaf rom com"
Worst idea for a good movie. Now technology wony be made and we will be set back almost 50 years from flat earthers and moon conspirators using this film saying Hollywood exposed the truth.
Present 8 Hours
I will watch it
Why do these streaming movies always seem a bit cheap even with huge stars?
we need graham hancock & randall carlson experiences on these 💪😉
TE AMO SCARLETT JOHANSSON
More PR for Omega, way to go
Releasing this on the day of a solar eclipse was clever.
Ya extrañaba a Scarlett actuar ❤🙌🏻✨️
My name is Jeff..
This isn’t going to help dispel any moon landing conspiracy theorists 😑
Love seeing Jim Rash in anything, the dude's criminally underrated
Of course they make a movie about this now. To cover up the cover up. Genius.
Apple = woke, not awake. I suspect the goal is to tamper and ridicule fake-moon-landing theories. But all their attempts these days of controlling the narrative are blowing up big time. Wouldn't be surprised if this also blows up big time.
the movie Moonwalkers did a weird version of this
Where's Tom Hanks & Ron Howard?
Repe the first amendment
My sister is an extra in this movie
That's a movie i want to watch
FOIS 🚀
THERE PUTTING IT RIGHT IN OUR FACES, WAKE UP!!!.. Nah im just kidding 😂 but fr tho i dont know if we truly went to the moon but i hope so
Black Widow and Duke still got it!!!
Fake it till you make it ~ JFK
Will Scarlett host Saturday Night Live?                                                                               ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Gambit with Black Widow 😏
This is what they call "revelation of the method"
😂😂😂Sugarlet honey❤❤❤❤
Yo wtf is that Otho??? 😂
I thought this was a Frank Sinatra film😭
quiet part out loud just like they cloned tyrone
Disgraceful
Love the idea
Can't wait to watch this movie.
Operation Avalanche
I want a whole bunch of satirical comedies based on inane conspiracy theories
ok I'm sold, this movie looks great 😍
This could be interesting
Is this why we have not returned to the. Moon or did we ever land there?  😮
People who thought this was gonna be a Frank Sinatra bio film 👇
another apple movie about selling something.
Columbia Pictures!!!!! 100 Years shining screens
At last there's a movie 😂😂
Kubrick jokes are so funny 🤣
Magic Mike goes to space?!😊 Jokes aside, this is a good cast.
Considering the general media distrust environment of the moment, why even put more misinformation energy out there?
Director Dean
“Let me play among the stars”….           Finish the lyrics please
Great. More fuel for the nutters.
Umm, given the current state of political mistrust and hatred in this country, is this really the right time for this movie?
When I heard about this I thought it was gonna be a frank sinatra movie, kinda like bohemian rhapsody, lmfao 😂.
The part where he gets blown up i hear Billy from double toasted laughing his @$$ off
Kubrick insisted on accuracy, so he had it filmed on the moon.
Then we had to fake it 17 times?
aha! So we didn't end up going to the moon.
Please don’t be woke, please don’t be woke, please don’t be woke
Fake landing
LOL, So this is like an alternate universe scenario to the world of "for All Mankind" , or is this the story of why the Soviets won the space race?"
What’s the song for this trailer??
Capricorn One, but whimsical.
so good 👌
Wag the Dog II
Migo meets Ash!
who would have thought BLACK WIDOW and CARNAGE in the same movie🤣🤣😂
Clever to release this trailer the day of the solar eclipse👌 the algorithm will be showing this to everyone
Soo.. a comedic moon-oriented version of Capricorn One? I'm in.
Should have gotten Kubrick, ha!
llooooll
I look forward to screen shoots from this movie on twitter/X as “proof” the moon landing was faked.
is it a- "Based on an actual events movie"?
1:22   The key sentence, explaining why the US faked the moon landing..😂
Civil War and now this man America hatred has never been higher really.
NASA serves no purpose and is just a government slush fund.
This year the Truth is coming
To muito ansiosa
The moon landing conspiracy theorists are shaking with excitement while exclaiming, “I told you so! I told you so!”  I can just hear it
Channing tautum can be good fit for Randy Ortan biopic he looks same
It should've said from director Greg berlanti, producer of free guy.
Interesting to see a movie on how NASA marketed its moon race programme.
And here I thought it would be a Frank Sinatra movie 😅
When did every Hollywood movie start looking like an unconvincing expensive game of dress up & play pretend?
where is louis armstrong???
"everything we will have sacrificed will have been for nothing!" - there are things called script doctors you know?
Yeah channing tatum works for NASA, thats about as believable as Chris Farley working as Abrocrombie and Fitch
Channing Tatum Never failed Impres us
Looks like the titanic coverup movie. Propaganda doesn’t need to change
😲🧑‍🚀
True story?
A missed opportunity to use  frank Sinatra
So how did this great American empire fall? Who destroyed them? Well... nobody..just themselves..like this
I lived then and know we went to the Moon! The stars are great. The story line is BS. Not likely I'll...
You make reality.... Fictional....so it's not questionable anymore!!  Nicely done!     👌
I hope this movie really ‘takes off’.
This movie is more like a drama thing.. So I don't know.. 🤷
Boooooriiiiiiing
If Scarlett is in it, it has to be good. She knows how to choose movies.
I always knew the footage was fake but the mission was real
Great, now I REALLY want a Speedmaster
Its fiction right? cant be real?
Only took them a few decades to think of a cover story...
Them losing weight since she left Barcelona
Vwaiting on the truth finally here wahooooo
Pretty much telling us in plain sight that the moon landing was fake 🤣👍
A movie about faking the moon landing? Are they bloody serious?
Why haven't anyone else went to the moon? It was fake 😂
finally😂
I knew it !!! .. They did Fake It !!!
DEAN DEAN DEAN DEAN DEAN DEAN DEAN DEAN
I definitely have to see this. ❤
They post this tralier on the day of Solar Ecplise
Smallant better be featured on the title track
I'll only watch this is tatum says.   My name is JEEFFF
Scarlett yesssss 😍😍😍😍
I Legit thought this was a Frank Sinatra Biopic
Another bomb for Apple ?
Ou, Lord, the moon landing hoax given new life. The people who made this have no idea what really happened, and disrespects the three men who died on Apollo 1.
...What about the CCP's Han Chinese? I suppose they're ok. They're not Russian. They're cultural. Down for the struggle...session. And they were around in the 1960's too dontchaknow. I can almost see the Chicoms out my front window here like it's a 1984 Red Dawn surveillance balloon. But I'm sure Hollywood's version of 2020s has it all under controls. Why didn't we ever do a big drama around the 1968 Moonshot? Call it: "Read Genesis, For Real Z's." Starring: the Institute For Creation Research.
"I think we should've gotten Kubrick!" LOL!"
I swear down if they don’t use the frank sinatra “fly me to the moon” I will be very pissed
They really trying to push the "We really landed on the moon and took off again" when they are currently struggling to even get on get rockets into space 😂
Woww. I knew it. We definitely didn't land on the moon. PHUCK YEAHHHH🎉
Scarlet and Channing together... Count me in. This movie is gonna make some conspiracy fans so happy. And some others will be pretty pissed too😅
Moonwalkers but boring
Great. Just what we needed. More confusion
Scarlett Johansson was amazing in The Prestige
Hello from The Netherlands  🙋‍♂
The Kubrick line was absolute gold 😂
Sorry, _Fly Me To The Moon_ will forever be linked with Tommy Lee Jones and Space Cowboys....
uhh...what?is this based on true story? or there are some truth in this? or...based on true events?
Channing just doing "WHAT!?" like he's Lil Jon.
Oh, look at that, humanity's latest attempt to package their own crap and sell it back to themselves.
this looks terrible and is it a joke?
I literally cannot think of a worse time in human history to make a movie with this premise
I’m ngl, I saw the title and thought it was another movie about a famous singer, this one being Frank Sinatra. I kinda wish it was lol
That’s great work!
Ia this like an era of bad romance movies like wtf where all these weird romance movies coming from
The first scene of the trailer had me worried, because it was lit like a bad YouTube video, but the rest of it looks pretty good.
This movie is a test to see if gambit an black widow work good together on screen before doing it in the mcu.
This is counterproductive
Buzz Aldrin is gonna be pi55ed……..
My name is jeff
This honestly looks really good. How did I not know about this before today?
this looks fun as heck
Boycott. Scarlett is an outspoken supporter of genocidal Israel
With all the many lies the Government has pushed on us in the last 4 years I'd now be willing to believe this conspiracy and movie. New JFK movie in 3...2...1...
I was hating everything until Woody Harrelson appeared; now I can´t wait.
Cool
Capricorn one, remake?
Oh crap.  Every flat Earther conspiracy theorist is gonna watch this and think it's one of those "based on a true story" bio pic documentaries.
"I think we should've gotten Kubrick." LMAO
Fun fact: This is a historical film based on real life and everything in this film are true. 💀
Looks terrible, beginning with that cliche meeting in the diner, to the ridiculous theory that Nassau shot "an alternative ending" - bad acting even in the clips, the characters look totally unbelievable, silly scenarios  - it's a pass for me....
Channing Tatum does NOT fit in here what the heck.
why do we need another movie about women saving nasa from ignorant men????? even if its a stupid hetero love story
scarlett is hot even when she is not trying fly me to scarlett lord
Channing Tatum and Scarlet Johansson pairing up for a rom-com/drama film was not on my 2024 bingo card
nice way to mock NASA 🤣🤣
..and its a true story.
Momma Scarlett is back 😭😭😭
The conspiracy theorists out there are going crazy right now
😂😂
Operation Avalanche did it better
Looks fun
Are they actually gonna admit it?😂
So black widow and gambit are planning to go and conquer the moon 🌕? 🫤
Free Palestine 🇵🇸❤
This is quite random. But ayy, I'm in!!!
This movie looks fire
Faking the moon landing? Now I know this movie is taking some major liberties.
Jeff and Wanda finna be popping off
Now that's a movie 😂 End of controversies..🎉❤
Scarlett's hair looks bad to me. Is it just me??
Another part of the fantasy is that a black engineer was front and center the whole time.
So this will be seen a documentary by way too many people...looks fun if you can realize its just a movie and quit your crazy ideas as being a reality.
I'm in
A must watch. Apple TV has been on a roll this year. Truly the new HBO.
I WANNA SPEAK TO SAMSON.
All the crazies are here to say they are right.  Sorry Channing Taintman and Scarho are playing pretend
Is this shot in 240p ?
Moon landing conspiracy theorist are going to use this movie as evidence.
That’s one small dean for dean one giant dean for deankind.
60 years old story again…
Yeah definitely not watching this, remove from the broadcast.
Well 2:31 of Trailer reveals entire plot so now we don't need to go see it. Did you enjoy the Movie?
I KNEW IT SUCKERS! I TOLD Y'ALL!
Eight Legged Freaks..
So this isn’t just moonwalkers?
"i told you so"
Funny and sweet. Count me in.
It's time to Fake the Moon-Landing haha
Let me play among the stars
So its true , the moon landing is fake😉
This looks very veryy fun!
Black Widow meets For All Mankind, meets Wag The Dog.   Three of the coolest productions ever.   This can't miss.
That`s what really comes out, if you mix "Oppenheimer" with "Barbie".
nothing can surpass the firmament
Now that's a trailer!
Movie is about fake American moon landing that America shot in a Hollywood studio 😆😆😆.fake America fake hollywood
This movie will be the source of truth for every conspiracy theories.
They made Kubrick hilarious I’m so in. Most anticipated so far 24’
Black widow has grown soft
Love you Scarlett 😍❤
no way they will feed this crazy teory!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There are certain artistic decisions that shouldn't happen. When you make a product that inspires the dumbest of us, you are a bad person. The Civil War movie is that and so is this picture.
Some nice propaganda for NASA and the government. We never went to the moon. We couldn’t even find the directions to build and craft and get back to the moon cause it was all fake.
the catch is the trailer making you believe they are going to fake it but channing tatum's character is going to prove its possible for space travel....clever strategy
This is like a different For All Mankind
This looks fun haha I’m in
It says “Fly me to the Moon” but how come I don’t hear the song in the trailer?
Props to Channing Tatum,  Always the same voice, the same accent, the same mediocre acting approach and he still gets these roles.
Lovely to see Scarlett Johansson again.
I am all the way in for this
no thanks I’m good
I know this is just a fun film but in light of all the “flat-earther”, “fake moon people”, this doesn’t help answer the disninformation.
Scarlett Johansson is gonna own the movie and I'm here for it🛐
Oh no Apple Original Films oof that's not a good sign
Here is The Savior  HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”  YaH is The Heavenly Father  YaH arrives via the TENT OF MEETING YaH was Who they Crucified for our sins YaH was Crucified on an Almond TREE  — Ancient Semitic Cuneiform of Moshe (Moses) — Isa Scroll (The Original Isaiah)  Isaiah 42:8 "I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.”  Isaiah 43:11 “I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.”  Isaiah 45:5 “I am YaH, and there is none else.”
releasing this on a solar eclipse would've been intentional...right?
Ugh
Lol can't wait
looks fun
I have confidence in Channing Tatum's new(?) era?
Finally, the truth.
I wanna see an actor playing Stanley Kubrick! 😂
Mad Men meets First Man. 😎
At last!!! The truth about the moon missions!
So NASA lies?
Tttrrraaassshhhhhhhh
Absolutely love the trailer, this movie seems very promising. I hope to see the movie when it hits the theatre!
SmallAnt will love this movie
Well this looks like trash, thanks.
I’m not supporting this conspiracy.
Smallant better have a cameo in this.
this movie looks good ahahah
*SPECTACULAR!!! 100/100!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩*
Don’t forget to Tatum your Channing
Three cheers for Michael Gross! Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room!
-____-
To The Moon Baby
Oh how I missed my girl, ScarJo!!
THE SMALLANT MOVIE!!!
so we've got Superman ( from the lego movie ) , Black Widow and Carnage. 🥵
I am in this movie as a featured extra!! 🎉
Who else was dissapointed cause they thought it was a sinatra movie
The Dean is the Deanrector of the fake moon landing!?
looks terrible
I am one of those people that absolutely refuse to believe that the moon landing was faked. However, I do find this fascinating about what if they actually did fake it.
wait is this movie supposed to be like a comedy?
Marvel and dc actors in the movie!
just no
I swear, if they actually end up using this movie to say that we never went to the moon, imma be pissed
Okay cool cast but the screenwriter has ZERO experience and the director sub-par so idk what the hell this will turn out like
Yikes...looks pretty unfunny from the trailer, for a comedy that's not what you're aiming for
looks cool. wait, Directed by Greg Berlanti? holy shit!
Moon Landing Deniers are about to have a fucking field day with this one. God Damn!
A movie about fake moon landing. Well I am in😅
so was the moon landing fake or not?
Watch For All Mankind instead...
In case anyone is curious no the moon landing was not actually fake, everything from the angle of the shadow to the technology suggested in that theory not being available yet debunks that conspiracy, it’s just movie here
This movie is a shamefull joke to the greatest human achivement in the twentieth century.
I WILL NOT be seeing this movie !!!
Weak!!!!!
The moon landing was a hoax.   Discuss.    😉
So let me get this straight.  This is inspired by the fake moon landing???
Not me thinking it was a Frank Sinatra bio pic 🥲🥲
A conspiracy theorist’s treasure trove has just been fed courtesy of Hollywood.
😮Magic Mike and black widow?
Black widow?
I was a bit scared that this movie was going to be a biopic of Frank Sinatra but this is MUCH better
👏✌️👍
Dude, I thought we were getting a Frank Sinatra biopic
WOW! Scarlet Johanson looks so damn close to Marilyn Monroe in the classic 50s-60s era get up.
Finally   Evangelion
They are telling us something here folks. They really faked the moon landing. No one has ever left earth.
❤
This looks fun
Can’t wait for all the conspiracy theorists to use this as evidence lmao
definately a movie to watch.
Channing Tatum as an astrophysicist.... yeahhhhhh right 🤣🤣🤣
Looks awesome!!!!
Looks good
This is going to be good.
The moon on fire bebe🌛
My name's Jeff
This Evangelion reboot looks really weird.  Not sure if I'm vibing with all the changes.
Hey that's the Dean of my local community college!!
Here’s the problem with the fake moon landing, those lights they’re using didn’t exist back then making those shots impossible.
This looks awesome. I'm not a conspiracy theorist but the moon landing one is probably my favourite of them all.
wait, what?!
Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum are like gender equivalent parallels
Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum this is gonna be good
Looks lowkey good
Gordo?
I love the Wag the Dog vibes!!!!!!
Scarjo!!❤️ Im really gonna watch this movie...
Channing might be miscast here but damn that looks amazingly conspiraciously funtasticaly super 😂
Has a very heavy "Wag The Dog" feel too it.
Anna Garcia's in a major studio film ...that's dope
Song name?
Kiana kaslana the movie😂
Miss.
Was that the Dean of Greendale Community College?
Remember the time when scarlet play charades with jimmy about Fly me to the Moon.
The moon landing was faked .......
so is this a comical take on a true story?
Aren't these guys like really old already, its high time they stop making movies and let the riding stars take the mantle
❤❤🎉🎉
1:16 huh?!?!?!
I guess he passed AP chemistry
I was hoping for a Frank Sinatra biopic but ok
🫵🕶️👍
the fact they didn't actually play the song that is the title of the movie is CRIMINAL
Lmaooooooooooooooo they are leaning into the fake moon landing conspiracy 😂
AHH I LOVE SCARLETT AND CHANNING TATUM
So they did fake it
I knew that the moon landing is just one giant hoax.
Jim Rash was inDEAN perfect for this part!
Should’ve been Chris evans
Wow, BLACK WIDOW and GAMBIT  💀🔥  Marvel × FOX  😂
Yes
Since when did apple start making a movie?
Countdown to complaints about like of Diversity in 3...2....1
Why are they at the exact same diner as Madame Web?
i'm definitely interested in this than i thought i'd be
yay yay yay
That moon landing set plot-point is so tinfoil-coded, what were the filmmakers thinking?! At first, this looked like Hidden Figures for WASPs, but now I’m too disturbed to check this out 😵
the queen, my wife, is BACK AGAIN 😭 🔥
Looks fun but some people will think it's true 🫣
This discourse around this movie will hilarious will def have people believing that moon landing was faked 😂
Another entry in the “mission to the moon” cinematic universe, along with hidden figures, first man, and the right stuff
Literally Like The title
I was waiting for the "Based on a true story" part.
Magic Mike and Black Widow?! Sign me up 🎉
Black Widow and Lego Superman are in this!? AWESOME!!!
Directed by Greg Berlanti. That CW's Arrow & The Flash Greg Berlanti??
Frank F*cking Sinatra.
IM NOT OKAYYY
Why Tf is The song not in The trailer????
This looks bad 😂
Woooooo.. what did i just see, did I just witnessed, The biggest conspiracy theory being made into motion picture ?? or I am still a boomer here ??
What are we doing here? Do we really need this rn? Really?
Cool!
"I think we should have gotten kubrick" MADE MY DAY!! hahahaah, I'm actually so looking forward to this!!
Sony Pictures Entertainment, You're awesome! Let's be friends, okay?
I thought this was a remake of the animated one with actual flys
I taught this was a movie about frank sinatra
The movie and casting looks great.. but the trailer... the almost gave the whole plot..
Awesome
THEY SHOULD PLAY FLY ME TO THE MOON BY FRANK SINATRA AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
So they decided to remake Hidden Figures but without Black people??
Scarlett Johansson & Channing Tatum chemistry is on fire & is so very romantic in Fly Me To The Moon!
Def thought it was about frank
SCARLETT JOHANSSON IS BACK 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
A quality Dean-rector.
This Explains alot
Wooow
This looks nothing like Evangelion.
In Fly Me To The Moon in 3D the 3 Fly boys Named Scooter, Nat & I.Q. Back in 2008 remember?
That's also the name of the 2008 animated movie.
GOTTA LOVE SCARLETT JOHANSSON ❤
Wait, so the moon landing was fake??
I really like this
I like Channing Tatum, but he's miscast in this.
THIS LOOKS FUN! CAN'T WAIT! ;;
All set to make a Kubrick joke at the end.  And there WAS a Kubrick joke at the end!  Can't wait to see this.
Finally Top Secret lunch.
This movie might be good. I hope Sony could have a deal with Apple Originals films soon.
Bayonetta ost?
And every moon landing conspiracy theorist just sat up & said, "see, I told you so!"
I’m
Black Widow from the MCU, Jenko from 21 and 22 Jumo Street and G.I. Joe, Manny from Ice Age, Tallahassee from Zombieland and Carnage from Venom Let there Be Carnage is the best cast choice of this movie!!!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Did they actually film a fake version? Also, is that Dean Pelton?
the conspiracist are gonna have a great time with this one
odd they didn't include Frank Sinatra's Fly Me to the Moon song
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy.....
Accordingly to the theories, it wasn't Kubrick who shot this?? Why not use a similar guy to play him?
this movie is gonna be great i bet!
Fly me to the moon Let me play among the stars Let me see what spring is like On a-Jupiter and Mars  In other words: hold my hand In other words: baby, kiss me  Fill my heart with song And let me sing for ever more You are all I long for All I worship and adore  In other words: please, be true In other words: I love you
I never thought I would see Channing and Scarlett together! They should make an awesome star pairing
The truth is finally coming out lol.
Guys my ex I've been with her for 3 months , the title of this vid was a song she loved it always and was her fav
Great Editing in the Trailer.
Must watch!
MOMMY SORRY MOMMY SORRY MOMMY SORRY
😂 congratulations on the employment, so glad I was not picked😂❤
This looks Great.
Awesome🐍
i really hope this move highlights how stupid it is when people say the moon landing was faked. Im worried it will only make people believe that it indeed was possible to fake such a thing and therefore must have been what they did.
And here finally is the much awaited trailer 😍 love from india scarjo❤️ really looking forward to this 🙌🏻
I thought it would be about frank sinatra😢
Channing Tatum is not a good actor. Yes 21 jump street was funny but mainly because of Jonah Hil but Tatum sounds exactly the same guy in every film and no guy back in the 60’s sounded like this it’s not believable at all. HARD PASS
So when the men went to the moon it was fake?
Didn't we already get this movie with Rupert Grint and Ron Perlman?
Who first thought of frank sintra
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT ❤❤❤
FRANK???
Great Trailer
بنظر میاد فیلم خوبی بشه
smacznej KAWUSI życzę każdej osobie, która to czyta ;)
Wow
Fly me to the moon~~~ 🌑🌑🌑
Я русский ❤
Sadly not frank sinatra
ye
Hi
Tonikaku Kawaii
Yesssssss

THIS BETTER BE AN ANIMATED MOVIE FROM SONY PICTURES ANIMATION
A romcom that takes place in the 1960s.
期待🤩
I can only think of Evangelion by that title
Waiting.
Beyond the spiderverse? 🔎

Julie London ?

SCARLETTTTT
Frank Sinatra biopic?
Ikko
Is it a Frank Sinatra biopic or a Sci-Fi action that is about 2 astronauts flying to the moon??
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy....
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy...
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy..
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy.
Time for new tobey maguire spiderman trilogy
Evangelion live action confirmed?!?!?     Jk
Let me play among us
Scarlett Jo, Let's Go!!!
SONY commit illegal acts for their own benefit, conceal them, apologize if exposed, and hope everyone will forget. This cycle continues to repeat itself. Fraud, bribery, embezzlement, fake movie critics and forgery of medical equipment inspection- Is there anything illegal they haven't committed yet?
I'm 100% sure that I'm gonna love this movie
So very excited for Fly Me To The Moon!
SCARLETT!!!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜
I’M SEATED
When is it coming to Netflix?
Apple Original Films?
Let me see, sia song, fly me to the moon will be used in the trailer 😅
SCRLETTTT!!!
So is Apple now going to own Sony?
What is this about?
I hope there will be an Angry Birds Movie 3
Evangelion?😊
I Believe In Scarlett Johansson This Year
frank sinatra
I Hope It's From Sony Pictures Animation
nunca olvidare que esta película seria con chris evans
me tocará ver el trailer en el colegio
AL FIN UNA NUEVA PELÍCULA CON SCARLETT!!!
Talking To The Moon??? When
SCARLETT JOHANSSONNNNN O MUNDO TE AMA
Scarlett Johansson from the MCU, and Ray Romano from Ice Age, you won't let this movie down!
Been a Scarlett Johansson fan since Home Alone 3😭😭😭
I'm absolutely so excited and happy about this. Can't wait to see my favorite actors together. Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum about to eat so hard 😂❤
Nice One 🤭
OMGGG
