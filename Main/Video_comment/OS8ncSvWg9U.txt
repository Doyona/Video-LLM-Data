Whats that stick for?
Great rack 😊
Just enough Clock work Orange there. Thank you two for these beautiful videos. Next time no tape?
F*c*,love your T*** ,toyah
Robert can make any song into a prog rock psychodelia masterpiece.
Drunken karaoke night at the pub vibes. Dreadful,  just dreadful...
Loved the Bonus Footage
Seeing Robert Fripp laugh is the most wholesome thing ever. Never thought I'd see it.
We Love Britney Spears ❤️
I'd like to hear that with a full band.
Toyah's channeling Alex...
Took me second to realize what she was actually holding....
Ooh err. Blimey. Cripes!  Oh dear. Ah hem, sorry, I mean thank you. Phew. Think I’ll watch it again.
бабушка может )
PURE GARBAGE
Sunday brunch on dem juicy melons
How incredible is Mr. Fripp any music, any sound... from planet you come from Master ? love you
WARIATY !!!😀💪
King crimson with a touch of clockwork orange
Love the outfits.   Toyah
I love this video, it is fresh and vibrant. Love the piece in the NYT, you guys rock!
NO .. it really is shit 😒 and a bit swingery. Bet she shoves that up his arse
😋😋
Famous well respected outsider guitarist/composer chooses to spend his remaining years Embarrassing himself producing Sub standard entertainment with his hack entertainer wife.   Don’t know what else you’d call this.
The crac must be 90
ВОТ КРАСАВЦЫ!ОСОБЕННО ТОЯ!ТАКАЯ СЕКСИ!🤪🥰
I'm not gay, but Toyah has a nice pair of...eyes.
Beautiful singing... better than Britney's.
Where has that truncheon been
maybe the best thing on the internet in 2021!
This is fucking stupid.
More please
Normal people: Watching Toyah. We Guitarists: Watching Robert. The whole time.
cool riff
#freebritney
Love it
I love them so much
thank you two so much   great to see a little humor now and then.
BRILLIANT ❤
Bra less and Bible Black...
Toxic is actually an pretty interesting song for the pop world. Thanks robert for a fantastic conversion to badassery.
I'm going to send them some Duck Tape
Mad as a box of frogs
This is painful .
It's a mystery how she kept all that under wraps all these years.
You guys are great
Toyah is the gaffa
Just found out the name of the owner of Toyahs local Chinese restaurant it’s a Mr wee 🤣🤣🤣
Is that a kitchen tool she's holding?🤔
Vomit
The tape ruins it
Total u dress see though
I guess Robert got distracted I’d have been drooling all over the guitar if I were him Toyah you are one sexy woman
Buy a metronome for the guitarist!
Well done. You are what makes Britain great, at times like these, take a bow!
🥰❤🥰
What a load of pappa stuli
"There was me and this is Robert, the supreme droog. Happy Korova Lunch."
Это что за дичь???🤦‍♂️🤣
nice guitar playing
Toyah can you do a cover of The Great Deceiver?
What a pity that Toyah is such a crap singer.
Io mi inchino di fronte a tanto distillato di genio puro. Perché il vero genio non è solo nella creatività, nella lucida visione di ciò che puoi creare, ma è anche nella semplicità, nella pura passione in ciò che fai. Io adoro queste due persone. Sono la dimostrazione inattaccabile dell'amore nella sua accezione più alta. Un abbraccio con il cuore 💓💓💓💓💓
I wonder why this 1 got lots of view's. I can't believe she got away with this 1 at all.  Young people most have seen it
Can You both be any more cool??? A super Big hug from Mar del Plata Argentina. You inspire me a lot!! 💓
Nice Malcom get up from A Clockwork Orange
Ever since I watched one of these Youtube is convinced I want to see videos of barely clothed middle age women(i.e. my age). Not so much long f they do not have Robert Fripp in them
I know 20 year olds that don't have a body like hers
Can I pull off the tape?
Pasties, leveling the playing field, walking that grey area.
Is that electrical tape. Not Gorilla tape I hope.
Hello great video music
I've just realised she's used duct tape.
I LOVE the way they love each other. You can feel it!!StaySafe&Blessings🦋
Sorry for this
You guys are incredibly entertaining! 🤣🤣🤣
Toxic guitar riff is tasty.
LINDA!!!
Something tells me that all this is leading up to something involving Toya brandishing a turkey baster ...... Brace y'self Robert!
Looks like so much fun that it's fun to watch
Thanks for all the beautiful music
🔥🔥🔥
Titney Beers
I needed this in my life lol!
I want the tab of this
Text book definition of the word milf!!
loves you two more
Very entertaining ❤️
She can’t sing but she doesn’t need to.
well done guys, really entertaining.cheers
This has the exact same energy as that vine of the three girls playing Toxic in a school hallway and I love that.
Screw #freebritney how about #freebritain?
Not convinced about the thruppnies.
this was the best one yet!!!
You were an icon of the punk/new wave era, you were an art in your time. Love you Toyah!
My love for you is blah, blah, blah! EEEE, whey I never, shu got some talent that lass! X, Geordieland.
I love Brritney too, but but only in the next life! Whatever that is? Oh, baby, baby blah, blah, blah!
As if!
WoooooooooooooW
A true GILF. You look amazing.
You gotta give props to some firm puppies!
Oh I just adore you two, such fun!
What’s for supper?
We love you...
So how do I get my free Britney?
The tape ruined it
This is bizzaro.
Hearing Robert laugh at the end of the videos warms my heart, I would go to King Crimson concerts back in the olden days and I don’t remember Robert ever smiling, stoic and stone faced the whole time, fully fixated on the music
Be great to see an iron maiden cover!
I keep wondering if those are real. They couldn't be that firm at her age.
love you in quadrophenia toyah keep rocking  both of you
Ffs Toyah put it away . Made me laugh . Crazy shite
Attention seeking and sold her soul to Satan
britney spears !  la pire !!! enfin .... THE WORST   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i am fond of you !!! truly !!!! alors pas besoin de scotch sur le bout des seins !!!!!! faut y aller franchement 💖💖💖💖💖💖
A nicely formed set
This is the finest line up of King Crimson since Jamie Muir left in '73
Thats what PVC insulation tape is for !!!!
Brilliant
Man! Peeling the tape off after this must have bought a tear to the eye!
wowww.....sexy toyah.....
a lot of people don't know who they are..especially the dude at the left..the dude at the left was said by no other than jimi hendrix that he had the best band in the world.. yes.. hendrix..
Crazy. Fripp digging in the smelly stuff.
What a waste of electrical tape
In my next life I want to come back as Toyah's sticky tape.
Wow, she looks great but sounds crap!
Raking the bottom of the barrel pathetic
To.bad 1% of women age that well
What’s with the nipple tape?  That’s the only reason l watch.
Great performance but I was also distracted😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
i love how he watches her every move
King Crimson were the perfect back up band to the Stones In The Park. They were very good but not if you hadn’t heard them before.
Two parts of Toyah defy gravity and time.
#FreeBritney
great to see you guys having fun...whatever floats your boat haha...I smile more watching you two than I do listening to Court of the Crimson King 🤴. keep on rockin
What a set of BANGERS.
This is awful!!
I still don't think she realizes that people just want to see their tits.... She could do a lip sync of a song with no lyrics or no music as long as she had her shirt off she's probably going to get more views than she does for the ones where she's just singing with one on LMFAO
i think i just watched this 100 times on mute lol
Are you talking about Britney Spears the Husky dog on Sixty Formula?
Is that electrical tape?
That is chronic 😭
Guitar playing is damn awesome there
Damn! I guess they're just reminding Brittany that they're always watching!
I am here for the soft porn....
Please, perform "Venus" (Shoking Blue)! It would be perfect!
WTF???🤨
Jesus how have I ended up watching this i need to get my head seen too.
🔥🔥🔥
What is 44Teeth?
I've learned 2 thing with this channel: only Toyah makes Robert laugh and only Toyah gets Robert distracted! 😅
I always have to join in with Roberts laugh at the end, good on ya Toyah and Robert
Please sign the petition to band blackb electrical tape.
This woman is a bit of a roll on butter !!!
44 teeth 🙂👌
Only the Frippmeister could make that track sound prog!
Goodmorning 🌞 happy #weekend 🤗🎶
Lockdowns are fucking asinine  you stupid fools.
Horrable
Honoring necessity and sufficiency, one Sunday at a time.  Who knew this is how to get a country and the world through a pandemic?
You two are amazing!! Thank you!! XO
love the clock work ...
WOW.... gorgeous
We want a covers album out of this
well, well, well, as your humble narrator is getting a tingly feeling all through his guttywuts...
You know, there is a Russian piquant joke : one night a little boy wanted to "pay back the debts to nature" and went to the "sanitary room" for this. Passing by the room of his parents, he heard some strange sounds, could not resist and looked in the half-open door. He gazed long, attentively, and with horror at the scene before his casual eyes, after which, with emotion, indignation, and a tremor in his voice, he exclaimed in a strangled voice: "Oh, good God ! And after all this, these people FORBID ME TO PICK MY NOSE WITH MY FINGER !!!"
Better than Britney :-)
Cover up thoses titles grandma. And dude tune your guitar non of you have talent lol wtf did i just watch
Keeping us going , thanks xx
How about a ‘Woody Dan’ cover ?😉
Bizarre!
Can only hope so. Always been my favourite. Great shape eh.
44 teeth say hi lol They are the ones that told me about you x
Excuse me, please, but wouldn't it be better for you to think about how to most efficiently save and multiply your money earned by honest work !? (Just not in the way that it happened to the most genius and brilliant poor devils of Pink Floyd, I think, in 1976). The incredible and deeply felt vocals of the magnificent Sir Roger Waters in the album "Animals" (1977), it seems, was the result of the serious financial losses incurred by him (and other members of this ultra-phenomenal group) as a result of their very risky investment of their cash in some dubious shares. It's hardly my business, though. Especially since Sir Robert probably has some very competent business consultants - maybe even at the level of the Ministry of Finance of the United Kingdom. Why not !? )))
You won't think that you're too old for that?
Weird
"Каждый мнит себя стратегом, видя бой со стороны".
Robert is one lucky fella
lol  - makes me belly laugh ;-)
looking sexy toyah xxx
Hi Toyah and Robert the boys from 44 teeth sent me over brilliant stuff thanks
climb the latter ladder...god's munkee!!
Wtf did I just watch !!! 😂😂😂😂
This couple are absolutely adorable!!!! SO down to earth, love ya's!!!
look the puppies are are out again and toyah and rob😏🌝😚👍
“Oh it was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh. The trombones crunched redgold under my bed, and behind my gulliver the trumpets three-wise silverflamed, and there by the door the timps rolling through my guts and out again crunched like candy thunder. Oh, it was wonder of wonders. And then, a bird of like rarest spun heavenmetal, or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now, came the violin solo above all the other strings, and those strings were like a cage of silk round my bed. Then flute and oboe bored, like worms of like platinum, into the thick thick toffee gold and silver. I was in such bliss, my brothers.”
I'm here because of the lads at the 44 teeth channel
They have to do a 'Lock Down Lunch' album...
Oh my god ....Is seems like all my wet dreams have finally come true .... My fantasy from the age of 18 .... The most sexiest woman in the world xxx
we knew she was a domina...
Sheep farming in Barnet..... I love Toyah and Robert being  Fripp. Xx
Do you even know the concept of hitting note or singing in key. Obviously anyone who thinks this good has no idea or taste in music and is just a creeper in for a perv on an old nanna who really needs to cover up and take up knitting. My ears can only bleed so much, please stop.
Brilliant
Ok 44th sent me here but I was a young fan in the early 80’s and still listening at 52 so thanks for all the good times and memories _ now reach out to the 44 guys
You guys always look as if your having so much fun.  Love it and you pair.
sO BrITISH,  I like it...
Great Brits
Lovely silly people, thank you!
44 teeth sent me here!
WELL WHAT A LOVELY KITCHEN SPICES RICES AN WHATS FOR TEA MAY ONE ASK PLEASE ENJOY YOUR DINNER
Great fun
Robert plays to effortlessly
Oh, fuck off you over-rich, pampered, exhibitionist twats.  Stick some tape over your gob, Toyah.
Such a gorgeous lady, simply stunning body... Toyah, keep up looking great 👏🏻
You may beat you you want  Reina
Will they continue after covid maybe in public unmasked one day?
Hey Toyah, the boys at 44 Teeth are asking for you👍
Robert finally gets sidetracked??? I have to watch each episode at least 6 times before I can take my eyes off Toyah to see anything else! WOW you’re a lucky man Robert.
funny as always
Need to redeem the Fripp!
Awesome
I say this as a compliment:  If you took this act to Vegas for a series of lounge shows with a full band, I would fly out to see it.
вы мои любимые ))))
Omg Toyah? I’m almost disappointed it’s not an air hostess outfit. Almost.
Though this video is already excellent, as are T & R's others; it could still be improved somewhat if someone were to Photoshop Robert's guitar out...😂
Bosshoss version sent me here
Production crew???
lol, I do enjoy a fine wine..
You know hell has frozen over when you see Robert Fripp laughing.
I wonder what Tony and Stan would have thought
fripp playing a britney spears song work surprisingly well
Ooop..they're back !
yes,,well?? who needs an arena or night club when you can get these looks and sound out of a kitchen.=== keep it up please,.
Love you Toyah, always have.......but apparently those 44 Teeth boys love you even more.......so get in touch with them !
Toyah is simply brilliant!
Very nice young Harold!  I’m not sexist but bloody hell!
That Better 👌🏿
The lads at 44 teeth sent me over... I'm sure they wanted to see your growler or maybe get your rat out 🤷🏻‍♂️
Don't knock em, the most best promo's ever, what a way to promote your next tour...if i had the same body..i would do it myself, well done Toyah and Bob  xx
44teeth says hello.
Wasn't she in Clockwork Orange?
jesus thats good enough to eat!,always new you had fab curves xxx
Been following along throughout this Covid crap. Fabulous distraction!! Not read all the comments so at the risk of repeating others, I can imagine Toyahs girls singing 'We wanna be free' ........
Hi Toyah, we love your videos they are full of energy. The boys from 44 teeth sent me over - we need you over there !  All the best and keep the energy levels high !
She must love Alice Cooper!
44 Teeth guys said to check your channel. Glad I did. Thanks 44 Teeth!
Breast episode yet 👌
Getting boring now
Mwah! <3
SMASH!!!!!
Robert! Steel strings on your Ukulele are SOOOO wrong!!!
Pair of fruit Loops
Great stuff. Give the 44 Teeth boys a hand, job for life if you want it.😉
Just to let you guys know there’s a Toyah page on Instagram you might be interested in .... looks spoof !! privateatoyah
I don't mind her totally naked singing. She's hot Robert. Love the see through tops.
Great guitar playing Robert  . Thats a hot woman you have there ,I think this is the best one so far.
I remember Toyah once saying on the TV something along the lines of "maybe I'm being naive but there's no such thing as casual sex?"... Really? All her years in the music biz and now this...?
What is the brand of this vibrator?
Maybe if Fripp did this acousticly with aggression/ ala MTV unplugged it would have sounded better...........however SHE IS TOTALLY ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When the music sucks, bring on the tits.
Bizarrely that truncheon is probably regarded as an offensive weapon in the UK. 😂
She looks absolutely gorgeous
I,m starting to to get addicted to all of this. 👍🤘
#FREEBRITNEY ! I love you guys! <3
My god fucking awful
Eeeemmmmm no.
What a beauty! All of this!
You were created by God to be eternal mates
A great couple of swingers!
Chris and Al from 44Teeth sent me here 😁 The guys would love for you to get in touch 👍 #44teeth
I’m enjoying the recent emphasis on Toyah’s breasts. Just being honest.
Very nice! Brought here by the boys from 44 Teeth and wonder if we'll see some kind of collab in the future.
Toyah, give the lads at 44 teeth a shout! Muchos grassyarse
You two are so happy nutso😅👍🇦🇺
so sexy nice teets
Mad as a box of frogs and I love it!
I used to think that Robert fripp was just like "progressive rock" cool. But now I know that he's really "cool" cool..
What a lovely pair of "tits"........the one on the left looks like he can play the guitar, whilst the one on the right looks like an extra from Stanley Kubricks "Clockwork Orange" trying to sing?........(Don't give up your day job love!)
Toyah is sexy as hell and has a incredible body. Perfect.
Haha love it
you guys are awesome!!!  Thank you!!!
I don't get it.
Great!  The guitar work is awesome, and the singing too.
The bonus footage should have been you applying the tape.
I absolutely love watching the four of them...
That truncheon 😀😂😂 Has Robert had hold of it? 😉
...can’t help but think a full length shot of T would have helped this film along?
Somebody's flaunting it.
Thanks for the mammorys... #freebrittany
🤣
Love it! Killer playing on that gold top as well!!
You guys know this is public, right?
Clockwork orange cabaret. Looking and sounding great!
Simply stunning xx
I'm here for two reasons... And as usual... neither are for Robert's playing.
I've heard great things in the 44 teeth  weekly news about your channel
Here from 44 teeth!
The kitchen makes the whole thing look a bit weird and creepy very unsettling.
I remember seeing Toyah perform in Trafford Tanzi and she looks even hotter now.
Toyah 44 Teeth sent us here, we all love you
So happy that 44 Teeth brought me here. You. Are. Epic.
44 teeth sent me.
Nice to see her jamming with her dad......bless
Este fascista habla de libertad y acá en chile en sus conciertos nunca dejo tomar una foto, si tomabas una foto te apuntaban con lásers y te exponían al resto.
Hey Toyah, love the show. Please show my mates Statham and Perkins from #44T 44teeth some love.
What is next to come
What guitar?!?! 😲😲😲
Poor old Robert, he's looking a bit apprehensive...with that thing in her hands....its gonna be a night....
I've gone cross eyed again 😛😛
dressed for ultraviolence
Free the Toyah two !
OMG !!!!!!
Can't believe the tour with Hazel been cancelled yet again gutted xx
"Oh, put your fake tits away you dizzy mare." my girlfriend told me to write that. Less nipple tape for me please x
Did anyone actually listen to the song.......too much distraction 🥵
Ya!
Nive bits....................................................ok Tits
Gorgeous lady!
Hi Toyah; i'm here as an ambassador for the two fine chaps from 44Teeth; please show them some love in your next upload.  And if you mention my name to them; they may wing a new set of bike leathers my way
WOW!
My wife is the SPITTING IMAGE of Toya. Sorry to be smug but I's a lucky boy !!!  My wife said to me " But I don't have Toya's boobs" I said "Don't worry - nor does she !!!"
Toyah... still defying the ageing process... must've had 1st pick in the gene pool tuckshop :-)
44 teeth sent me here
Great fun loving it.  Big thanks to 44 Teeth to sending me in this direction. Replay it loads . Trying to learn the guitar piece
I hope that's not Gorilla tape she used........??
One hell of a body x
Toyahs voice is so good that she can dress like this and not distract too much from the song.   I recently ordered a video message for myself from Toyah. It wasn't a special occasion or anything, I just thought it would be great to see and hear her talk to me. Definitely worth the money. Honestly it made my day, my year even.
This is one of the breast videos ..
nice rack !
these guys remind me of the 'Jane Barnes Band ' but the other way around Jane keeps looking at Jimmy
Nice Blouse
Boys from @44teeth sent me here, love the vid
Is this the lady that was in in the nut house throwing  soap powder around all those years a go
#Free Britney ,# free the girls.
I like the clock work orange look
Toyah is like fine champagne and Robert is a very lucky guy
44 teeth sent me here, good work!
This is about as cringe as you can get, embarrassing.
Toyah, loving the vids. You need to get on 44 teeth With the boys! 💙
Think I need to move back to pershore
Fine Filly  !!
Not only is Toyah channeling her Clockwork Orange  She is promoting the KC Vroom logo as well
Absolut! Thx!!!
They are awesome and hilarious! Love you two!
Very good!! Bravo!
What looser gives thumbs down? Thumbs up all the way.
Can't tell in this video if the thermostat is on or off
Bazongas are cool.
https://youtu.be/73O8XrkKqpU  get with simething actual. these twats suck.
but would you cover a 916 in gaffa tape ?
Great 👏👏👏
Excellent, thank u!
What's with all of these spammers posting about 44Teeth, whatever the fuck that is?
se antoja una shugar momy como Toyah
Not sure what the heck this is....but it's not a music video cause she can't sing.....but who's looking at that....oops, I mean who's listening?
And I thought 'Enter Sandman' was an eyeful 🧐
Ok....I think she's doing it on purpose now.
Extraordinario!
Poor Robert. Condolences bro.
Starkers and Bible Black...
Hi Toyah. Love the song. Get yourself on 44 teeth they will be forever grateful to you. Maybe you could sing a lock down news theme tune 👍🎶
44 teeth promoted me to check this out 🤩🤩
I do love watching you two...I love seeing Robert too.

44Teeth sent me here as well they are big fans
44 teeth say hi.
He absolutely has a go after these videos 😂 who wouldn't 🤷‍♂️
If one good thing is to come out of lockdown it's keeping these two weirdos indoors. I don't know what's worse, toyah TRYING to be famous or that weird husband gawping.
bullshit
Is "c" on your poster in russian ?  In russian it means "with"..
How can anybody not love this?  It's playtime.
Ha ha brilliant - & Robert hass the best laugh!  Bless you both. Free Britney is a disability rights issue - many many many others are in conservatorships who should not be - it's a system that needs to change, as with disability rights in the UK. #EndAbleism
Shiny.., Golden 🎶 Entertain.,   🤨  YusSSs
44 teeth love your videos, and I believe would like you to present their news section.
Hi Toyah. The boys from 44teeth say hi

Raving, just what we need in this crazy world.....more please.
Just as well Robert had a roll of insulation tape handy...
Robert get a grip, man!
These just keep getting better and better !
Sorry Toyah , coming across as a bit desperate.?..
Hi Toyah - We come in peace, courtesy of the fine gentlemen at 44teeth!
I'm like a rabbit caught in the headlights!
B'Zooms!
Damn it by the end of lockdown she's gonna be completely naked at this rate. aye
Mr Fripp playing Spears..... my God ........... please stop them ........... that's ridiculous ............. sometimes , it's better to do nothing.......
when i see Toyah in this clip, is she inspired by A Clockwork Orange?
44teeth send us
The bonus footage is hilarious 😆  Thank you Toyah and Robert.  Please tell me you will tour together after lockdown?! 🥰
Makes me want surgery 😞men just like boobs, i am flat and alone at 37.
Just subscribed for more SHOW!
I've been a huge fan of Toyah since the 80's...Do you think that's a good enough reason to be invited to come for Sunday lunch? ... PLEASE!! :)
Freakin awful and embarassing
Still objectifying and sexualizing herself. It's getting desperate.
Well done you two. If possible. Could you give a shout out to Chris & Al. They run youtube channel 44 teeth.  Many thanks.
please check out 44teeth they are big fans of yours,good work sweet
The ending..... more bloopers.... please.
🍅
His eye contact is unparalleled

44teeth says Hi ;)
Brilliant stuff 👏👏👍💪
Lol love her she's great ,she could make a comeback anytime
Ha ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant thanks for the delightful giggles, I will be sweeter all week,
What a set of bangers !! 💣💣🏍🏍🏍🎵🎶🎵🎶 44teeth says hi !
Can we stop with the whole, free britney thing? She is bipolar and unstable. There is no conspiracy, just a family trying to take care of their own.
School is hard..
Please Robert ..... Ditch the partner and go solo 😜
These videos will be the death of me. I mean, I'll go out smiling and sweating but they will definitely kill me
That wont bother her anything for money poor Robert!
Definitely milking time
This old hag is making me sick, should she not be in a care home
When you don't visit pornhub, pornhub visits you and brings electric guitar along.
@44teeth would like you to show them your growler, massive fans!!
🎵...You Can Leave Your Hat On!...🎵
That was great! Not only did that look like fun but they both have wonderful, natural laughs!
Hi Toyah, 44 teeth told us to come and take a look.
We all know where that truncheon's been.
Free the nipple
You don't have to stare at the camera all the time.
Also: Great musical performance!
Such a lovely little chic x
Hi, just saying hello from a 44 teeth viewer, we love u 😍
Absolutely brilliant, as usual !!!! Rock on !!!
That man is a freakin' genius.....
44 Teeth sent me over. I'm here for good now.
👀
Mid life crisis
Came for the tits....stayed for the tits
Quite worrying really
Somewhere there's and exposed wire.
It's like an updated scene from A Clockwork Orange.
On Ya Robert she's a hard life lol
https://youtu.be/qY-AKK_zSTA
https://youtu.be/qY-AKK_zSTA
Bless you two! Wonderful performances.
Those puppies look well treated.

Lovely as usual.

44teeth collaboration!!
Reminder to self: Tape this one! ;)
1:52 Fart?
I think you and your amazing husband Have just confirmed what an amazing icons you are, all the costumes you wear are so revealing and riskey for your Sunday lunch, you are in such amazing condition for your age I think you deserve for all your efforts to be on the cover of playboy or a centrefold amazing body,??? You could make thousands for charity and good causes, and also get something back for the way you and your husband have performed every weekend for the good off the nation. Quality makes me so proud to be British, please keep entertaining us god bless you both.!!!!
You are a pisser lol ..
Brilliant ....X marks the spots xxx
What do the initials GNU stand for on the drying rack that hangs on the ceiling?
I love these videos! They always give me a smile. The love between you shines and is inspirational. You both rock as musicians and human beings. Cheers from Seattle!
At this point i really don't know what the fuck is going to happen next...

How did he get Britney Spears for this clip?
Time for Robert to show his bits!
Toya.......😍😍😍😍😋🥰
Sending love from @44teeth
We love Fripp music but you really should stop making fools of yourselves. So cringeworthy singing like Ethel Merman.
Please please can you contact the 44teeth lads and do an intro for them... im sure they will appreciate it 😂... ps keep up the great uploads.. keeps me smiling !
TOYAH!! I’m here from 44Teeth!
I keep seeing this pop up and finally checked it out expecting it to be "cool". Suuuuper cringy. Wow. Some folks should know when it's time to throw in the towel.
FUCKING NUTZ 😁
Hi Toyah, 44Teeth sent me here -- yeah, I'm easily led.    :)
where,s britney in gitmo with madona ?
Glad Toyah thinks I’m in the Top Six!!
Hey Toyah! The boys from 44teeth sent me here! Great job the two of you!
Boy o boy..every time I listen to Elephant Talk, The Sheltering Sky, Frame by Frame, etc. I now picture Fripp running around in a ridiculous dinosaur costume..so sad
44Teeth sent me here as they love what you do.
#FREEJULIANASSANG
Doesn't the guy from Toyah & Robert's Sunday Lunch have a band or something?
LOL
Resistance is futile. X
44 teeth sent me here

Sales of black insulation tape have just shot up!
Hi Toyah 44teeth sent me here!! Love your content as much I love 44teeth content... please colab!!!
Toyah - look up the chaps at 44teeth.com. They're huge fans & sending their viewers here to check you & Robert out. They're desperate for you to record a little intro for them 😁
who the hell would give  a thumbs down  ??
Toyah could you give the lads 44 Teeth on You Tube a shout please they have requested we all come across and have a look at your channel. Thanks and keep up the enthusiasm. David.
Crikey.
Never any washing hanging up to dry! Must be on the radiators..
Also here from 44 Teeth
I’m here because of 44 teeth 👍🏻
Dumplings with the stew tonight then ?
Wow!!!! Mad as a box of frogs.Love it.
Yes ...
Good golly, Miss Molly...
I'm titillated & love these videos
How does Youtube continue to let this get posted 😂
I love both of these artists’ work and fully support any craziness they can conjure up.
These people are having too much fun. As they should be.
Great performance by those Two
Bruh the guitar is so King Crimson wtf. Robert Fripp is such a master of his sound and I stan him
..and once more, no camels were hurt during the making of this video.... unfortunately!
Surely that's gotta sting when you peel it off?  (I'll be standing by with the lotion!)
👍👍
Holey Moley!!!!!!
super reprise  un jour il faudrait faire le morceau bomber de mothoread  merci
Now, will I fear easter eggs or christmas bells?
did not realise toyah had such a fit body.
Loose the black tape!
get a life
Voice as flat as the fake fun bags....
There are many uses for black tape but this use is the best I have ever seen.
If she started bouncing around in a braless jumper, that would cross the line of naughtiness.
And the trutcheon goes where?
I’m a  old fan. Also....Toyah is a beautiful woman
I do look forward to Sunday's
What. A. Rack.
Yummmm.....I mean Arrrrrr
Absolutely love these two krazy kids ♡♡♡♡
damn
Creepy weird
I get distracted and I like it :o
Love it
I only have two points of note to make.  . . Oh fu@k it whats the point. We love these guys! 😁
Sorry, but ROBERT FRIPP.......playing Britney Spears!!!!!! Wrong on EVERY level!
Mastermind bbc2 will be interesting tonight as someone is answering questions on King Crimson as their chosen subject.
Omg!
I'm only 45 ,but I think she is quite sexy I must say.
He could always play the guitar, she could never sing.  Good to see that some things don’t change.
Btw I can appreciate how good and not exactly easy to do this tune is.
Release the body guards 🥰💞❤️
I got into the MILF channel by mistake?
Cheap, tacky and tragic
still edible breasts 😊  congratulations 👍👍👍     --- even if it was the intention ----
That tape is doing a great job of holding things together, unlike Robert at the end! :P
WOW still a stunning lady, love the see through top.
Lol , so this has now hit the Daily Mail , I predict a few new subscribers !
What is she going to do with that truntion. Robert keep your arse to the wall.
Hey how's about putting a montage of outakes? That will be just as fun👍
'Ahh, Mr Cope. Still looking for a job, are we?' 'Well, we aren't, but I am. What have you got?' 'It doesn't pay much, but Toyah Willcox wants someone to help her get dressed and undressed for her YouTube videos. There may be some application of... ahem... 'tit tape' and it's consequent removal.' 'Wow, sounds great, sign me up.' 'You'll be interviewed personally by Ms Willcox at her home in Worcestershire. Here's the address you need to go to.' 'But this address is in London.' 'Yes, that's where the queue starts.'
Hope it didn't hurt when you removed that tape Toyah!
Damn Toyah, you never looked like that when I used to bump into you in Tesco in Pershore. I'm looking forward to the tour with Hazel. Keep up the good work x
Go on girl. I’d be round in a flash/ luvly- simply luvly 😆👍
You're off ya fucking head mate!
Are you serious!....who in there right mind wants to see some old as hell granny with her t!ts out 🤮🤮🤮🤮
#freethetwins
That was FCUKED RITE UP!!
As ever top marks, Toyah gets sexier evrry time you do a video. Robert you, are so lucky.
Crazy girl 🤣🤣🤣
Aguante Tito!!!!
Qué grande Roberto!!
This is extremely bad, Robert, while I know your "calling card" is Jimi saying your band is, was the "Best band in the World." This is painful. Is it too late to quit this one eyed club you are taking direction from. And return from where you came? Thank you, Christopher Robin Yes, that one.
What an amazing bust
Robert managed to improve this track on his Guitar: the original recording is very boring, now i can finally hear and enjoy 😌
You know narcissism is a mental illness and then all people well it shows on the outside
What a lovely couple. I had to refrain from using “pair.”
ENOUGH TOYAH!!
I never, ever thought I'd rather be Robert Fripp and not Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, <insert pretty anyone here>.  Boy done struck gold and he is having a damn good time.  God bless you two.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
⏰🍊...talk about the right conjunction of Angels of merci and something tight...😁God bless
If only she could sing!
Don’t we all want a great partner like this. Great fun, and what a beautiful frontage Toyah
Is it just me, or are these two idiots useless !
That guitar work tho
Why is this on my recommended?
https://youtu.be/JU2hrwaggpY
What a great pair of swingers. put the Toyah knockers where they belong. Support Toyah
No !...Droogie....Dont Crash Here !
Fantastic I’ve watched 9 times
Bob how can you look at your face? I’ve had difficulties for my eyes have wondered elsewhere. Your a dedicated partner Robert....
So fucking delicious, mami!!!
Toyah is not the Messiah - or even his wife - she's just a very naughty girl. More please.  I sense a bit of a homage to "A Clockwork Orange" as well.  And Robert almost fluffed his chords (NOT a euphemism) too. I wonder why!!!
#FreeBritney ❤️
I never get tired of looking at that pair 😉
Whenever I have seen Robert with King Crimson he has always looked so serious and po-faced. Toyah must bring out the fun side of his personality
Fuckin horrendous
Where do the batteries go in that thing ?
Wow Robert gets sidetracked for once 😂😂😂
sorry but this is a pile of wank
Crap crap crap 👋👋💊
I didn't know this man could smile
nice shirt....!!!!!!
Although, as an amateur, I record digitally for cost reasons, in professional music I've always said "keep the tape there!" Weirdly, don't feel that way today.  Anyway, splendid as ever, and #freebritney: abso-bloomin'-lutley.
You a lucky man Bob 😜
I'd love to see her sing 21st Century Schizoid Man  (or Woman ! )
whats the song where Cher's on a boat in a little black G string.. ?    See you next week.
Love these two...........who says “mature” peeps have look old or behave old? 😂😜👍
Nice VIBE
Damn, she's a babe!
Bit of a Wendy O. Williams tribute as well!! Love these
Larks' tongue in toxic
What a lovely couple ..........
OK. Who was the key inspiration for the eye makeup: Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange or Alice Cooper c.1973?
Robert Fripp is and always was an amazing guitar player, but what the feck is Toyah like ? Oh dear, she has lost ye olde plot and looks desperate for attention. Poor Robert looks terrified, I am sure they had a great laugh doing this, but I find it creepy.
why i do not look at fripps guitar?
furiously planting pampas grass to lure these two round...
Someones getting pegged
I hope you two realise just how much joy you bring. Your laughter, love and the amazing generosity with which you share your talent is helping to save our sanity. You light up life in the most delightful way. Thank you.
Terrific - so much fun alongside the serious message: #FreeBritney
Toyah your better than this put those two bob bits away
No Roberts were harmed in the making of this video, afterwards maybe but not during! TFS, GB :)
Wow....oh yes the singing was also excellent.
Fascinating.
Waiting for a Billie Eilish cover now!
What a Joke you two are becoming.  #Freebritney, really? Bwahahah hahaha hahaha, indeed Robert.
wtf   bat shit crazy.
Awful,  please stop.
Crazy kids!
Dear Toyah  you are wonderfull. But  your  gothic  style  is  a little bit too extravagant.
LMAO....
G I L F
Careful with that truncheon Toyah !!
A little less tape next time perchance?
Once again, I am thoroughly entertained. Thank you Ms. Wilcox and Mr. Fripp. Keeping us sane during insane times.
" i see what is right and approve , but i do what is wrong "
I bet Robert is no stranger to that truncheon.
. . went into B&Q and they were out of black electrical insulation tape . .
That's the first time I realised there was a guy behind the camera as well. Toyah, you're looking wonderful. ❤️
she would get it big time
Fantastic shirt Roberts wearing. Nice to see Toyah made an effort as well.
I'm 25 and I am not as hot lol
Robert 's uniform
The song that comes into my head whenever I think of Meghan Markle   ...and Alice Cooper's Poison too !
Sunday luncheon truncheon munchin. So funny when he loses it!
Toyah & Robert: I love you both to bits! You are an amazing couple. 💖
Why are we talking about her she is so done with.I mean Britney
He should play '"Lucky Man" by ELP  :)
Be afraid Robert, very afraid !
Love you both!
Happy international womens day !! Bend over Robert !! Love you guys ❤
Call me an old fashioned hetrosexual, sexist misogyinst if you will, and no doubt an ugly femiNazi will,  but I DEFINITELY would!!!
ooh that tapes gonna hurt
Toyah you must have the world's glammest dressing up box.   For someone who hates her boobs your doing a fine job honouring them.   I'm jealous.  🤗😘
you can understand why kids get embarrassed by their parents, but hey ho exactly what's needed in these Ground Hog Day times; thank you.
I taped my drums and amps like your woman bumps.
No Miss,  please don't beat me,  pretty please no,  haha,  great work guys
Blimey Toyah, you minx 😳
Roberts a lucky guy ! 🍆
When this is over,  would love to see them doing  a  Evening with Toyah  &  Robert  Tour . Brilliant
These vids are so tiresome now, be quiet, put some clothes on Toyah and FFS stop trying to sing, you are both just embarrasing yourself.
Thank you, thank you, thank you
I am not a Britney fan but this is a very nice gesture!
Brilliant cover and absolute joy.
Please stop doing this - stop it immediately
Love it, as always 👍🏻😁
On International Women's day I'd like to say how disappointing this is.
My father in law has drier like the one in the top left of the frame.
Brilliant,  so original. Very skilful.
You two are just like whisky, you just get better with age and Toyah you are rocking that look🥰
Нормально 👍
What terrific guys! Always bring a smile, who would have thought!
She sounds like shit but who needs music.
Lovely  well done you two I have always loved Roberts music and Toya you are brilliant ❤️❤️❤️
Wait, so ... there's been a third person there this whole time?!
Shes SMOKING!!!
Can we only appreciate Robert's guitar skills as he managed to arrange a pop song in the guitar?
This is great 👏🏻
love + energy  -  perfect !!
Toyah's assets are a national treasure🎖
Living Toyah and Roberts lifestyle is a goal
Poor robert looks like her dementia ridden grandad.
❤️
Nice pasties!
Can't survive without being in the limelight give it a rest
...😄whaaah, cool & sexeejjjj!! ...🙄🎸&👩🏻‍🎤...
shouldn't that be a bowler hat?
I knew there was a reason I needed to keep watching this delightful couple ... wow 🤩
Live... from The Lingerie Luncheonette.... Maybe do Oops I Did iIt Again... but the Louis Armstrong version.  ( yes it's that old )
They make me so happy. 🥰
im liking these less and less
Toyah's a bit ready for the old ultra-violence!
I have too admit that my first thought was.   That is Robert going to do now when he needs insulating tape to repair some electric or guitar cable?
Jesus Christ, she makes me a believer.
What the .....
Best madness ever ...spontaneous, harmless and original.. What more can we say.. Brilliant...👍👍 Thumbs up from Simon in Spain...
Robert is doing better than Toyah? 🤔
Love it!
Love these on a boring week day, please keep it up!! P. S. What size batteries does that trungen take??  😜😂
They are still pretty damn talented though
Britney should be very proud of you both, and I am being UTTERLY sincere when I say this, oh...and Robert and Toyah too!!!
I Need the tabs
...like a fine wine with bipolar notes.
well.... this is something.  if you had told me more than 20 years ago that robert fripp would do a cover of britney spears song.  either i'd be laughing my ass off or be telling you "you're full of shit."  this is an incredible cover and someone show this to britney.  honestly, this was better than i expected and in the past few years.  i've actually grown to enjoy some of britney's music.  she's got some good pop songs.  a collaboration between britney spears and robert fripp i think would destroy everyone.
lol <3
Wonderful, thank you for another great Sunday Lunch but please next time save the tape, use a lot less black tape. #Free The Hooters
Aw yesssss!! Love this so much 💎💎 #FreeBritney 🐺🐺🐺
Jakko may be a poor Toyah but I will be cross if this isn't adopted into Crim repertoire whenever touring resumes
Are you interested in another Washing Pulley X
sellotape not insulation tape please ..
That's Robert Fripp. Progressive guitar God. Playing Britney Spears.
I think Robert's fingers were still a little sticky from putting that tape on earlier and that distracted him lol.
Who's the cameraman?
Robert gets distracted, classic.
Toyah and Robert, from Florida with Love!! Thank you for great entertainment!!
Living in hope, is so much better than perpetual nope!
Oh come on, Toyah, now you’re just doing it on purpose
Fun stuff!  Thanks Robert and Toyah!
She is looking and sounding great! I also suspect that they are both having a lot of fun, perhaps more than they should!
Robert IS human after all.
Somebody hide the damn black tape! Lol
Total, you are gorgeous and inspiring. Love you!
Alternate Title: Two Plastic Puppies Fight for Air in a Mesh Shirt
Robert's laugh at the end was just a bit maniacal, wasn't it?
Thank you, Toyah and Robert, especially for the bonus footage! You two are both adorable and brilliant! :)
Cher called and wanted to know if you’re done with her gaff gape.😅
sticky black tape should be illegal
Pretty good looking women for her age.
Love it!
Love the shirt 😆
The crossover I never expected!
Free Brittany 😆😆👍Love theses guy!!
I love it when Robert performs different kinds of guitar styles!!
Has britney replied ? Love 2 hear from original artists .
So funny , i mean this in the nicest way.they are not right.lol
Is there a guy in the clip ?
Ive never noticed how cool the guitar line in toxic is ?
Nothing i can say that wont be deleted or get me banned.ill say nothing.
Mr. Fripp is proving just how talented and well rounded of a guitarist he is.
Were you referencing "Clockwork Orange" as well?
Toyah's plastic surgeon is a genius!
Don’t watch this while eating, as you can’t mix the residue in with gravy.... it still stands out,no matter how much you say you’ve put mayonnaise in 😍❤️👌
Seriously, what bollock brains are downvoting these?
They are such a lovely pair..
What is going on, yesterday the recommendation engine gives me a live concert that Adrian Belew did in 2019 with only 4000 views, and today I get this. YouTube knows me way too well.
This was adorable, love it! #freebritney!
Thumbs up for a 2022 Toyah nude calendar! 😜😜
Great set ot tits
THANK YOU 🙏!!!!
If lockdown ends, so might this beautiful lunacy. Hmm, I think I'm going to cough on everyone in Tesco to get numbers up again. With that and the schools going back, we could keep enjoying these two (and Robert, of course) until Christmas. Kerching!
Absolutely fabulous  !!!!!!!     you make my day
Stroke it Robert, stroke it.
"We love you, Britney!" - followed by the laughter the kind of which ends "Easy MOney"... ;-) :-D
Good she brought the twins.
Fuck me. I guess they say sex sells.  This kinda proves.it.  The little guy was funny lookin.  In what way. I dunno he was just funny lookin’. Can you be any more specific. I can’t really say; he wasn’t circumcised. Was he funny lookin’ apart from that? Ya.  Is there anything else you can tell me about him.  No, like I say, he was funny lookin’.
BOnKERs,love yas
Toyah is next appearing in The Life of Mother Teresa at the Shaftesbury. I am hoping lockdown will never end.🐈
You are both musically immensely talented, but you should also continue to improve your skills as comedians. You are great!  👏👍
La naranja mecánica.
Outrageous it's Great
It is funny, I watch this for Robert Fripp.  Gorgeous playing, immaculately dressed gent.. and to see which ludicrous outfit Toyah has on this week.  Though some of us remember Toyah when she was a punk rocker.. and yes she had the most ludicrous outfits then as well.  Plus the sheer look she is sporting is to ape Britney, though in a good way.
😜👍 bonkers the pair of you
Robert, if all goes as planned, I will be one of the 5 females at you show June 28, 2021, in Lewiston, NY.  What should I wear so you know it is me?  I will know who you are by the bee costume you will be wearing on stage.  We love watching you.  You both are true entertainers.  Laura, Fairport, NY
@1:02 - Robert's face is pretty much the same as most viewers... o_O
Britney is radged as a c**t. She aint dead her father has done a great job with what can only  be described  as a fruit loop or whatever the Yanks call breakfast cereals. Just saying 😂😂😂
Uhhhh
Wow
Alan Baxter speaks for the nation. Boris, you're out mate.
If  I promise to believe in reincarnation, can I come back as sticky tape?
All jokes aside. I am loving Robert's playing of the string line from the song!
Blimey, how many batteries does that truncheon take?
Hate to say it but one or two of their videos were cool but not anymore sorry
I just love it !
I hope you’re not going to use that rhythm stick on Robert.  Ouch!!!
See Robert flinch. Priceless!
Awesomeness
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under With a taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you!
I would
Who are the 128 sad folks? Let's all be very positive and help them out.
2:10
I wouldn’t mind a couple of pasties for lunch, watching this has made me hungry.
A Clockwork Crimson Orange
After all these years 😳still sexy as hell
Great! Much credit to Toyah for keeping herself in great shape and looking more sexy than most 18 yr olds. Lucky Robert! You dirty old man! Lol Good guitar chops,  Nice arrangements! Robert!
Always love to see the Twins!
🙌🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️ (luved bonus 😂👍🏻)
They’re real and they’re spectacular.
I thought they had religion in there lives, I could be wrong but wow that looks good.
Insulation tape ..is kool
Absolutely brilliant! Certainly brightens Sundays,  more  please roll on next Sunday
Subversive .... or what? ..... wonderful !
Oh so clever, and brilliantly entertaining. What a wonderful couple you are. And that outtake is comedy gold 🤣 I think you are going to end up with millions of subscribers
and now the ball is on Britney's side
You pair really warm our hearts up ! Thanks so much.
Ha, Ha.... I love how Robert keeps one eye on that billy club!!  LOL!!
Fantastic    Keep up the lockdown  🤩 FUN 🕺🏽
Alrighty then...they're both slowly losing their minds.
Brilliant.. 🤪😂
SHIT..... just noticed.....ROBERT FRIPP on guitar!!!  wow..  Looks quite pleased with himself.
LMAO The end of the vid is so funny
These get crazier and crazier.......god bless the two of them.😀
Jesus Toyah you can't sing to save your life but  you do look good trying so thumbs up from me.
The mischief is strong in these two.
Bless you two. On most Sundays, it looks as if they've had as many martinis as I have. Toyah's a trip.
Pertinent Clockwork Orange reference.
It just isn’t fair...
Referencing clockwork orange and the plasmatics?🤔 #oldschool
😎
Brilliant! Love the clockwork orange reference 😁👊😎
Too much sticky tape, stop teasing us. Let’s see what your made of😝
Toyah you are beautiful thank you for everything
Thank Christ Robert's sitting down  not sure where that truncheon might end up......
I have some wires to splice.... Where did that tape go?
She could have someone’s eye out with those
never thought toyah would give us a taped performance ;) where's the patreon page for the untaped version.
This was my 59th birthday weekend and this video was the cherry on the cake thank you Toyah and Robert
Fantastic, love you both!!
Brilliant. As always! Especially the bonus footage.  Is that a touch of Clockwork Orange there, Toyah?
He must be one happy man !!!  sutch a hot lady
Thanks for perking up my day Robert and Toyah!
One of my weekend highlights...please keep me on the distribution list. This is too much fun to pass up.
These videos really make me smile toyah you are the best
That was Funny x
Barmy, the pair of ya 😁
I volunteer to remove the tape.
Make, I, larf! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,..... Haaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!
I LOVE YOU GUYS FOREVER AND EVER!  From Victor (Rodan)!  Do you want me to play violin with you?
Love it! Love the Clockwork Orange theme and the outtake too!
Reminiscent of Wendy O. Williams’ nipple obscuring modesty tape😏
Simply Lovely
She's no Britney but still ... wow.
HELLO NURSE!
I swore I wasn't going to stare at Toya's toys...but.... Oops I Did It Again.
Don’t know whether it’s an age thing or what ,  but  just love it , rock on
Absolute total love for you two.
i love toyah
This is brilliant! Great fun every Sunday! Please keep going!!
Hells bells, that's brightened up a dull day 😍
Another FUN Sunday Lunch, God Bless you two.
Who else is there ??  I think Robert is ever so cute and sneakily naughty ☺️☺️☺️
My weekend wouldn't be complete without an eye full of those Bristols...
Fripps n Nipps at their finest
BRAVO!! I'm a 61 year old guitarist and singer who "got a real job" 23 years ago. It's heartwarming to see and hear you two having so much fun and still performing. there's something almost satirical about your performances, but your high levels of ability and professionalism  are obviously legit. Thanks for what you do.
Please stop
I hate electrical tape..
Tapeless
Must be implants! Can’t be that firm at her age. Not complaining mind 😉
Toyah ,you make me laugh and laugh .Daft I call it
Love the Clockwork Orange look.
I love you guys,,,,,,  need tour dates🤩😋😍🥰😃😃😃😃
Sunday is not Sunday without Toyah and Robert!
love per tons to the old seriuos british gentleman i heard a century ago in argentina, toya love both of you
I didn't blink once Toyah , all 50 times I watched it !
Toyah look so beautiful
After a shitty football Sunday a little Ray of sunshine. These 2 are awesome!!!
Get down and get with it, by Slade.....please Toya!!!
They were both brilliant. Robert did his part as well.
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love.
I think Robert may just be the luckiest man over the age of 70.
Alice Cooper never did it like this. . .
Great Cathy Dennis song.. Local H also do a wonderful heavy cover of Toxic :)
I know I’d be totally distracted..😍
Robert, Toyah and the girls never cease to bring joy. We’re not worthy.
These 2 wonderful humans just keep on giving.
Anyone else here just waiting for three buzzers? BZZZZZ.   BZZZZZZ BZZZZZ sorry, it’s a no from me 🤡
Hit me with your Rhythmstick
Effing Brilliant
Bravo Robert & Toya...I c you! Viva México!
Insulation tape tiddies 👍
Can we rewind the tapes?
Marvellous.
Great duo 👌👌
Is that a tide mark on the truncheon?
You two literally make my Sundays lately! All the best to both of you! :)
How desperate are you?
Love you both, bravo!
Damn I love your videos......... much sunday lunch fun .......... keep em coming...................
Nice nod to Wendy-O.
Shame Toyah didn't use sellotape!
I just love watching you 2
Another belter. Loving it. Thanks Mr. Fripp. I have taken up guitar playing at 60. Wish I'd done it 40 years ago. Tab1961.
That booth of the get maker is the only Sting I asi of god
Thank you Robert and Toyah for bringing a smile to our faces.
When your weekend begins with “Robert, get the electrical tape!”
Your both looking well!!!.......... AND Robert 😉
Gotta love Toyah and Robert 😁
OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING!!! This video made my day!!! Fripp is one of my favorite guitarists and I never knew he was married yet alone to such a bad ass woman!
Yup! Brilliant!!!
Crikey! The Clockwork Orange/Wendy O'Williams/Britney mash up certainly adds value to the lunch on a Sunday!!!
Just love you two.😎
At least something good out of lockdown
Gotta just love these two, up for some light entertainment thank you both. Xx
Clockwork orange anybody.
Love the guitar tone!
Any left overs for the poor cook.
There is usually too much red tape but now, it’s too much black tape.
Would've been better without the black electricians tape....
Fantastic!!!
Free Titney!
ive got blisters:)
Oh my god
What the fuck is happening here lately??
I believe they will not play I talk to the wind...
What a tremendous pair! Toyah and Robert
Well! what can one say? quite a lot actually...................
great googly mooglies, Robert looks hot in this
That sexy lady is a real tease
BRAVO....!!!!!
She can't sing worth a hoot but looks good trying!
I love you guys. Keep it up.
oops you guys did it again!
Rob *chugging that low C* in his wacky tuning
About a 2 years a go I was at the seer to tell me the future. He told me he see the plague. It sounded scary so I wanted more details. After a moment of silence and concentration he told he see King Crimson playing Britney Spears song in the kitchen. I thought he was a fraud so I didn't pay him. Now I know.
And you know, I love you Toyah.
Seeing a little Clockwork Orange vibe in this video.
That booth of the get maker is the only thing  i asi of god
Absolute shite
Mad as a box of frogs ! Love it 😍
Что они курят?)))
Clockwork orange style. 🧐 Love it
Wonder what Robert had for lunch? Lucky man 😘😁
😛😛😛🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's Hard to comment

I assumed it was just the two of you there but I heard a third voice.
Toyahs always been stunning
Адский треш и угар, тащемта например
the tape is unnecessary!!!!!!   NO TAPE NEXT TIME PLEASE!!!!!!!
Free brit

I don't care what anyone says, he can't be doing her any justice!!! I would.................................
Rough! Only way to get attention, most people except that you’re lime light fades - not a narcissist! Cover up!
Love it love it love it love it!!!!!!!
Strange but captivating.  That dame is fit for any age let alone hers
It’s getting the insulation tape off...that’s going to be the problem?.....ouch!!!
Wow Toyah, I’m in love
Liked this one! Great guitar part.
Stunning and still a very sexy woman x

JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJ EL FINAL, LA RISAAA
Free Britney ❤️
Love Toyahs clockwork orange look .. amoungst 2 other things 🤣🤣 Keep up the great work Toyah and Robert .. brilliant 👍
The bonus at the end is the best part! Robert, always the serious one, lost it.🤣
Toyah and that truncheon! The mind boggles 🤣🤣🤣😳
Ye know where that truncheon is going next Robert?
Electric tape vs silver dollars......👀
The best of corona
Please do a cannibal corpse song
Tremendous!!
Missed you earlier ⭐
Never mind free britney, free the Mitchell brothers
Thank you, Brilliant cover of my fave Britney song. Robert well played. Toyah well sung. Love the Clockwork Orange homage. Bravo! Encore! At last Robert gets distracted.  LOL!!!! Robert your laughter is infectious. I love the both of you - keep rocking!
Toyah, wow! You look fantastic! What’s your secret?
You are great, Thank you!!🤗😎🇦🇹
Oh is it a  clock work orange reference, I only just realised..
My PC has no speakers and I've viewed this eight times........👀
Lucky man , god bless 😓
Love the outtakes more please
Never disappoint do they.
Do i detect a touch of "A Clockwork Orange" in this vid!? 🤔
Dropped by just to stay abreast of things...
this is too sexy
That was fierce, my mind went.... Full on art!
Un bloody believable. Common as muck.
Круто!
I wonder what's for lunch.
I'm not managing to see-through to chords Robert's playing this week?
Frickin amazing. On point. Period.
For an instant I thought I'd walked in on part of Clockwork Orange. :p
When I stumbled across these I was familiar with Robert from Crimson but less so with Toyah. What can I say,  now I'm smitten with the both of you! Thanks so much for the Sunday afternoon fun during these times. Can't wait to get back to traveling and seeing shows again but until its safe I will make  sure to stop in and see what you kids are up to! Cheers!
They are a lovely pair. Robert and Toyah are great.
Top Girl! Oh, and Robert!
Nice!  I literally released my metal cover of this song yesterday on my channel. I'm dressed a little different though, ha.
Hope they carry on after lockdown.we are loving this.
I love cabaret , well done 👏
Guys, you two are really the best!!!!
King crimson at its best!!! YES
Thank you kids for another inspiring video!🙂❤️☃️..I also agree to free Britney! She deserves to have more control of her life! She has worked hard to get what she has and she should have the right to make her own decisions now.🐸❤️🕊🐅🦄🌻🐝🤘🦋
You both have so much fun together i look forward to your videos
Do the Plasmatics have a new vocalist?
Did I just see this?  *watches again*  Yes. That happened. Love it.
I think we all know where that batons going  😨
No wonder Robert looks a little tired from time to time. Can you imagine??? Geezus. She's 100x hotter than any of the talentless, test tube bimbettes singing today.
:D
best so far !!!!
Complimenti alla signora Fripp! Gode ottima salute!
Rob and Queenie I predict this will be most popular!  Thank you for sharing so much of yourselves with us.  Don't forget the heart meds tonight fripatonic master of the long stretch!
Robert is looking at Toyah in fear ! If he says anything he's gonna get a beat down......
Robert I love your laugh !!! ....but ......just to be clear, I love much more your wife shirts !!!   ahahahahah 🤣😁😃
Made my weekend.  Robert is too funny and Toyah is great.  A wonderful couple.
Another great video you two!  Love the fun positivity!! Much appreciated... Thanks!
I think she looks fantastic
dayıoğlu naptın yav
Yeah baby
Amazing as usually 😘
Toyah way did you think every time i see your videos this lyrics come to my mine YOU SEE, I LIKE CUTE GIRLS WHO GOT BIG TITS(  ●  Y ●   )😙 THE BOLLOCK BROTHERS. Oh and Roberts looks like Mr. Magoo he need only the hat 😀😁😂😂😂😂happy Sunday for both! ✌😎 imagen
These videos never get old! Somehow, I’m getting a vision of how a pop song like Toxic can make for a great prog cover
That looks pretty hard to play.
You should expand your operation and move to Pronhub.
They 're both hot😂. And funny! Great couple
Solihull,s top girl , still turning the world inside out
Shame about the tape quantity you should never use more than required ! Thank you Wonderful Fun
There lost the plot🤔🤣
My favourite pair :) absolutely wonderful :)
I love Roberts laughing, he reminds me of Fozie Bear 🐻 from the Mupets. Thanks for spreading the happiness every Sunday 🤘💛
Please come to the good ol USA please. We deserve a spanking
What a sexy lady!!!!!
Homemade pasties... works for me...
Seriously, does anyone click on this for the music?
Two of a perfect pair! Great family
Sex toys in public...whatever next Toyah!!!
...too much tape Toyah 🥰🥰
its a fair cop, but please Toyah, put Robert's truncheon down
I imagine Robert is a bit concerned about what she will do with that truncheon later
Mesmerising performance!
Nice blouse! 🍺😎👍
Great on the Eyelash reference to " A Clockwork Orange" Congrats Guys!!
M'attizza la porcona!
I was sure that was not so easy, right on Robert !
I watch these for the cringe now
love it
I think they need to stop
Such a novel use of gaffer tape!
The boobs of Dorian Grey
The best couple ever! Kisses from Brasil.
She is so Funny and still sexy too!!!!
Reminds me of Alec from Clockwork Orange
The Brits are the Best.....the invasion is wellcomed....come any time....they got the message right.
Two national treasures ... ahem...
Every "Stacy's Mom" fantasy come true 😈 Robert has to be the happiest guy around.
Sunday' s Clockwork Orange
Geweldig. Ik kijk elke week uit naar dat geinig lachje van Robert.
You know I didn't even know Robert Fripp knew how to laugh.
She is my MASTER!!!!
And my weekend is now complete - I have tears of joy and absolutely hilarity rolling down my face. LOVE LOVE LOVE

Why does Robert ever go on tour?
I love these two, they look so genuinely happy, it’s a pleasure to see!   All the best, guys & Toyah, you look amazing!!!!
Looking great Toyah, wish I could rock the outfit! 🤣
Hahaha, love it! Can I come live with you too, always looks like you having a great time
Toyah and Robert, lease do a Plasmatics or Wendy O cover complete with (in)appropriate costumes and props. Thanks in advance.
You guys are the light of lockdown! <3
Abstract burlesque..bravo
God I hate black tape!!!
Such a lovely pair of stars to look at.
He said lets sing kiss, she said lets sing brit     so it came to this
Nice bonus legs.!
They're solid
She never  ould si g bt hell how cares 😜
Thanks y'all. See you again next week.
Instantly I thought of clockwork melons sorry I mean orange Never toxic always a tonic see you soon for Sunday lunch Toyo and Roberto
Truncon or vibrator ?
This must be the longest-lasting lineup of any of Robert's musical ventures…. Mind you, wonder if any of Toyah's costumes would fit Tony Levin?
I’d love to hear Robert Fripp play on Britney’s comeback !
Amazing and talentous couple! Love u so much
Bravissimo
Omg,! You two amazing artists are just brilliant! I could watch you both watching paint dry and I would be fascinated! I love you both so dearly.  Cheers! Don in Oregon.  #WeLoveBrittany
That reminds me, I need to get some electrical tape
Will ever get out of LOCKDOWN 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Another naughty. One from toyah
What’s she going to do with that truncheon
I love it 😻
One Sunday I'm gonna tune in and completely lose my sh1t when I see a no holes barred rendition of Butcher Baby, by Wendy O Williams and the Plasmatics.  Ooohh yeah!! Toyah, they're gonna put you, away!!!
Jajajaja great tribute, Britney was a crush from my youth. 💟 😋
How desperate at another stab at noteriety can anyone get, she was awful 40 years ago
Bet they went to bed afterwards and took the truncheon with them as a toy!!!!!
Yet another broad smile.
Please please Hit me Baby one more time 👍👍👍
Robert Fripp, you're a lucky man.........
I could never *_not_* be distracted
Lucky Bugger that Fripp
You guys are pathetic shame on you
First, this needs to become a regular part of the KC set list. Second, of course these two have a truncheon in their "tool" kit.
Robert is a lucky man to have such a hottie 60yr old wife
This has gotta be your greatest sunday lunch ever.....🙈😍
Never worry about keeping it together because I loved that. I think I prefer this to open hearts can unite The Yoga teacher.
Brilliant
I wonder where that truncheon has been hiding
Thank you so much making my Sundays start off so enjoyable! What a great couple!  And so much talent!
Is this a joke?
How sweet. Thank u for speaking up
When I first looked at Touah, the first thing that came to mind was "A Clockwork Orange".
Grandiosi!❤️❤️❤️🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹❤️❤️❤️
Foooooking hell.
😂🤣😁Absolutely brilliant.
Blimey!!!!! , so that where my roll of black tape went 🤔 👍
Art.
Toyah is a beauty, however, the musician in me keeps getting distracted by Robert Fripps playing. I sometimes need to watch a video 2 or 3 times to take it all in. Well done T & R...
...I got distracted too
Fantastic 😂
excellent choice and performance, thanks for your advocacy!
Your its are gorgeous T.
Making our Sundays great...what a pair!!!!xxx
Thanks for another great Sunday Lunch.
The couple at the bar are in to you. She really hot.
They both should go on tour they would get a lot of people coming to there concerts. 😘
Another use for Gaffer tape, brilliant stuff? or is it a spare piece of SM911 from one of Roberts Revox decks!!
There oughta be a law against too much electrical tape!!
Thank you, God.
Another mesmerising performance I see ....... utterly provocative and classy at the same time.
Those two are amazing . And the guy on guitar is okay too.
Yummy
You don't have to be naked. It is so refreshing to see and hear You both. It is every weekend a highlight for me. Sometime YT send good advertices.
Wow! What a super surprise. Robert Fripp playing a beautiful interpretation of a Britney Spears tune and Toyah hitting those imposible notes with her wonderful voice! Not to mention a tip of the hat for those responsible for costume control!!😲 The best thing ever first thing Sunday morning! Thank you!!!😘
Oh toyah & Robert your both great xx
...Casi un Tango!...
I could of think a couple places I would like to put that truncheon
I just love the solid relationship between these two. Toyah and Rob are also amazing.  :)
Welly, welly, well...how about some of the old in and out my lovely
Fantastic stuff as always. Love the out take - thank you both for brightening up our Sundays.
;D
Apparently Robert Fripp was in that video somewhere!?!🧐🤷‍♂️
Gorgeous as always Toyah
Free Britney!!
Even after lockdown, please continue.👏
just what you need on a sunday afternoon...brilliant!
Well, there ya go. Happy Sunday. 😁🎶🎸
Awesome video  Censors are getting stricter. Wendy O Willams could get away with only two strips of electrical tape.
Nice!🇬🇧🇺🇸✌🏻️
Awful rendition but ur body is banging x
I bet Robert buys blue pills in bulk.😂😂
Poor old Robert..he has to sit there and get poked in the eyes or get abused with Toyah's big black trunchen........go for it Toyah and make him eat his Meat and Two Veg....
You guys make me smile everytime 🤣😅🤣😅🤣😁😁😁👍👍👍👍
"OMG Robert all my bras are in the wash!!!" LOL I love these Lockdown vids, you guys are crazeeee!!!
Dear Toyah, I'd tell you off for your mischievous and salacious shenanigans but I fear that would only encourage you. Love to Robert.
Off with the tape 😎
gaffa tape ..one million uses....one too many !
I love you both❣️
1002 uses for insulation tape,what a great product it is👍
These are a delightful pair.
Mad as a hatter. Love it
Thank you once again for Sunday lunch. Always a good tonic 😉
I hope a lot more new people will discover the amazing catalogue of work Robert has done, as a result of these vignettes.  Although it's not the same as coming from that direction, I'd love to hear "Sartori in Tangier" again for the very first time...
Im just here for toyah's shirts.
You make Sunday so much fun. Thanks for doing these👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
there's a hipocrisy! you can show the b00bs but no one can say the word b00bs in coments and who say will be censored?
You two have been such a spirit lifter during Lockdown 3, 4 or 5, I've lost count!! Thank you for being you.
Robert keep your hands off that bloody electrical tape ! spoilt the song  ;)
Es necesario que esa señora salga siempre mostrando las tetas?
Getting that tape off is most definitely going to be a two-man job!! 🤙
You look more gorgeous each week 😘
Toyah - please can you just writhe around a pole in silence every week in skimpy outfits. Robert can shower you in twenty’s.
😶
Poor Robert; he’s only 26!
Free Britney indeed!
just love you crazy dynamic sunday crazy crew :-)xx
Wowza!!!!
Yes yes just brilliant keep it going guys we love you
Just blows me away that some people get obsessed by the human body. The music is great the singing is great the performance is great.... but yet I see all these comments about some skin or body parts. Just something I keep noticing. Great show as always ...I love you both thank you !!! Keep them coming please 100% positive vibrations!!!
🤩❤🤩❤🤩❤🤩❤
Real Horrowshow.   🗡 🕑 🍊
As a guitar afficianado... it would be cool to see other guitars in Robert's collection.
I’ve always liked Toyah. I mean she has a knockers but I’m a fan.
Haha... I think Robert may be a little sarcastic in freeing Brittany
Master class guitar love Fripp. Waiting for more. Thank you 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
#freetoyahstwins!!!!
Free thruppenny bits
Great times ...great body x..saw you in panto stevenage loved it...
I am so in love with Toya sorry Robert
WOWWWWWWW    10/10    merci      from Montreal Qc ,
@0:56, Robert almost loses concentration, but like a boss, continues to play on, without missing a beat. 😉
Not sure why they have an old truncheon around the house but my guess is Robert's gonna get pegged at some point!
Well he probably did pay for them!
It's Alex from Clockwork Orange all dressed up for a night on the town.  Viddy well.
brings all the boys to the yard..
I love you both. Toyah, I NEED that shirt! 🙏🏼💜🕊
Saw Toyah in "Tales Of The Unexpected" last week - she was a great "Blue Marigold" Girl!
You folks sure don't live a boring life!!! That dude from King Crimson playing some Britney Spears!! Hahaha kudos for your sense of humor!!!
Good Job Robert!!  Cheeras!;-)!!
Brilliant just Brilliant, best part of any Sunday.! And my god your a lucky man Mr Fripp.... Alex.
Oh you tease you. 😊
so sexy . wow.
Hey Toyah did i smart pulling off the insulating tape 😣xx
must have been sore taking of that tape ooft
Brilliant 😁
Amazing thank you 😊
I wonder why they have that truncheon in the house, must be to scare off burglars ;)
YEP,IM IN 👍
Love you guys, thanks so much :-)
Viddy well!
Am I alone in not appreciating the new initiative to get more subscribers?
Turned this into a Crimson tune All theatrics aside, very creative on Robert' part!
I love you both very much!
That totally melted me
Jeez. Nice tune lol.
Thank You
You lied you can not be over 50. Hope this does not stop after the lockdown.
You two have so much fun together.   Carry on!  💞
I'm looking forward my chicken breasts tonight!!
What pandemic? What lockdown? What isolation?
Excellent Guys  well done thank you 👍
LOVE YOU FROM ARGENTINA LOOOOVE
See those two.....
I got to say it - I love Robert's deadpan look while playing amazingly. and well, then, there's Toyah!
This would have been on my list of songs that wouldn't work on guitar, but he mostly pulls it off.
Love the outtake keeping it real and marvellous. 🌟🌟🌟
And the sparky Robert hired to light up the garden shed is still looking for his lost roll of tape.
True..... that would distract any man... we understand Robert....
You tow are a delight!  Thank you so much. Keep'm coming. (Hope that tape wasn't too sticky 😬)
She projects more innocent sexiness than all female performers one third her age. Bravo.
Delighted to see you both having so much fun! Thanks!
Best.  Super.
Two beautiful talented performers. Thanks to you both for entertainment value far beyond the utter rubbish the TV stations are offering at the moment. Young people should look to these artists for guidance and not the manufactured clap trap a certain Simon churns out.
Lose the gaffa tape.
Need more nudity :-)
Brits definitely have some different humor. Lol
So it takes a 15 inch truncheon to get Roberts attention. We've been watching long enough to have suspected that by now anyway :)
See You next week 😀🤚👍
Robert you certainly have your hands full my good sir!
Happy afternoon T&R
cant get enough of this....simple fun
shmee150s mum
Brilliant. Always makes me smile.  :)
Gotta luv FRIPP'S laugh at the end 😛👍🏻
Pasties really why bummer.
Brilliant
Thank for the bonus 😂😂
Both as mad as a fish🤣
corr look at them
Bloody insulation tape 😩
Robert Fripp has no weaknesses, expect seeing his wife wearing a see through.
❤
Takes me all the way back to the 80's
<3
Hugs love you two. Thanks for my smile today.
Love the included outtake. 😄
I’m just wondering what amp Robert is using.
Is Britney the left or the right one ? ;-)
Robert I am still having trouble paying attention to your playing! Lol..
Why do I watch these ? It’s a mystery !
We all know where that truncheons been don't we... a policeman's saddle bag.
🎵💎🎸
👏👏👏👏
Always bring cheer to the old sailor across the pond. Lots of love to you both, and be safe
Off there trolleys I love em
Roberts looking at that truncheon saying " HELL NO "
I bet there was quite a pucker factor pulling that tape off!
Wow!
Love you 2 wished you had tv show 😊😊😘
Just as it should be... R&T having fun with life and spreading love
Loved the stylish top today and the hat set it off perfectly. Shame about the tape, though.  Noticed the less energetic dance routine today. I wonder why. Careful with that truncheon, Toya. You'll make Robert's eyes water.  %- )
Proves that sex sells..
Yes that's what I'm talking about!
How nice to see Robert get distracted for once. In fact it's the first time I have noticed him.......
"A Crimson Orange"
So how many batteries does that take ?  Because I could feel your vibe over here .!
Sunday Sultans of Swing .... Keep on swinging
You guys are adorable, thanks for the smiles!
Just getting better and better,did wonder what you had in your hand though! But distracted away to that lovely blouse!
Admiration for both of you 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
I love Fripp and this is entertaining but man its also he freaking sexiness she is a very sexy woman.
Torah you look fabulous , and Robert can’t ,take his eyes off you , neither can I lol keep up the good work , love you both ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍😎😎😎🎸🎸🎸
Toyah & Robert definitely have MUCH more fun at Sunday brunch than most of us care to admit we have, I think!
Roberts face!! LOL
💙👊😎
2:00 jJajajajajajaja
Lucky bastard
They make me😁
As usual brilliant. 👍😁👍
Must be Sunday because Toyah's got her baps out again. Eyes front Robert, eyes front.
Happy lockdown Sunday lunch to you Robert and Toyah
Careful Robert, she's wielding a truncheon!
Give the people what they want. Fripp and boobies.
Best Britney cover I have heard since Oops I Did It Again by Children of Bodom - rest in peace Alexi
Brilliant...
Magnificent 😉
what a HOOT(er)!!
I love these sketches!  🤣 Thank you!
..."ooooo what a Lucky Man he was" :)
Toyah, you looked (see-through top) stunningly beautiful. Love the Movie link, fitted well.
Watch Roberts hands. There aren’t many guitarists worldwide that could play that.
Some people do not age.
Indeed: how can't anyone be distracted in that place?🤓
Spy the surfer jets toxic cover
Wonderful!  Love the bonus footage!  Thank you for all the smiles and laughter you've brought to our lockdown.  The world needs more people like you.
Excellent as always. Do yourself a favor folks, listen to Dweezil Zappa's version of Hit Me Baby One More Time!
I love you guys  thank you so very much
I bet that truncheon has seen some action
So good to see these two again.  Oh and Toyah and Robert also.
I would love to be - a fly on the wall - when you remove the electrical tape, Bwahaha. Toyah and Robert, you two are amazingly entertaining. Please keep on keeping on.
WTF
Yet another genius slice of joy! 🤗❤️
Oh god, bedroom tools!  Cover the nipples with electrical insulation tape, hahahaha!
better than a spoonful of sugar ,  thanks Robert and Toyah for the laughs and giggles
Thank you !
Interesting how Robert can stay composed  .. 😎
Cheers for cheering me up and having a good laugh   🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Who’s Brittney?
Thank you.❤
Horrible song....fantastic boobahs
I want to see the THIRD take:)
I would just like to say thank you,I now have something to look forward to every week and never been disappointed in both of you
I hate this tapes!
Are these guys on onlyfans?
THIS IS SAD
ahhhhhh sunday lunch
Pitty toyah used black electrical tape, what was wrong with good old sellotape ?
GREAT! Now I’ve got a boner while driving to work. What the hell am I going to do with this thing NOW?! 🤦🏼‍♂️
Is there an opening for a tape removers position?
Homage to Clockwork Orange?
I"ll have some of what there on please.
Absolutely brilliant!!!!
Acoustics could be better✌️
Isn't that the Red Hot Chili Peppers logo?
That truncheon looks very shiny.
Mr.Fripp is keeping an eye on that truncheon, wouldn’t want his fretboard damaged! Mind you Toyah has some tape he could use should he need it lol
Such a beautiful woman hottie I would merry her on heart beat
... still don't know if this is supposed to be the round up of the week or the start into the next ... ;-)
KINDA OF CREEPY
Mr Fripp must loves a lot his wife...
Errrr ,,, WOW 😁👍
Absolutely brilliant as ever !!!! Makes my Sunday !!!
White T shirt must be in the wash ......
Toyah and Robert ,what a pair mmm
Did they have the baton just lying around at home? 🤨
Every week you guys give more fun and energy to us, Toyah is positively blooming!
What love those two exude , a joy to watch .
So, who gets to remove the tape?  And who will it hurt most?
Hello Droogies.
My day is good now, yep the sun starts shining, a Big Thx
truncheon luncheon, yikes!
Bopping Bobby is a one man ‘Wrecking Crew’
I would love for them to do a song by RUSH,,
That's,, even pathetic is an understatement. It's not a hateful comment, and don't get me wrong, Robert us a good strummer  and his riffs are solid. But man what's wrong with you guys.. for the views you r just throwing your boobs in our faces like this? I shake my fist against this lool. Well most of pervs are doing so. So umm congrats for keeping there hands busy. Whats your next step? Porn hub?  Good guitar performance, bad experience for me to watch...
Possibly the most difficult “Where’s Robert?” to date.
What's in her hand ?
Wow toyah is incredible
Totally ace,,, Happy Sunday Lunch,,, Lunchers
Hi...Robert and Toyah.....first of all, thanks for your wonderfull videos.....I have a request......."Sweet Virginia" by the Stones but, very important, it would be nice if both of You sang the refrain. Many thanks again and Best Regards, Bertoni Massimo (Italy)
Chris almighty........
Good to hear something a bit longer and also Toyah's range. The Surfrajettes do it infinitely better though.
Toyah and Biker Stuff - The two breast things on the youtubes
It almost sounded like larks Tongues in toxic, part ii.   😁
Hey this up there with the exercise bike! 😳
I was looking for my gaffer tape the other day and just remembered where it is now. Thanks .
Brilliant!! Great headlamps too
Both of you are a credit to humanity in terms of your looks you look very healthy and a life enjoyed
If you've got it, flaunt it, and boy has she got it 😛
Stop fucking about and cut to the chase Toyah!
I wonder at which point it was during the lockdown that they first went bonkers
“Well well well my little ‘druggies’ , it’ s a Frippin ‘taped’ show!”
Brilliant as usual x
From Bad to Perverse!
Toyah has a great rack.
See talent can buy you everything Mr Fripp 🤣🤣  Best part of the entire lockdown .
Damn I hope she put some Vaseline under that tape
If you can't duck it, f```it.
You're just gorgeous, I love you!
Ay Carumba!
Oooooh Toyah.

The best Sunday Lockdown Lunch ever!!!
It’s great that you can be so free and open! I miss those days.
These Sunday lunches just get better and better
Whoah Whoah very nice I like 👍
Wonderful - you guys continue to bring light into the darkness (ps: if you need a hand removing the tape... :) )
Time to tune that guitar...strings a bit loose.
Good stuff! 🥰😁🤣👍
Never used to like her ,but I now look forward to these two on sundays
Why did she taped .......
BRAVO
Pa cuando el onlyfans
Quite sad really that an artist of her calibre has succumbed to flashing flesh for views
i love your great sense of  humour !!!! love you two
( . )( . ) 👅👅👅👅👅👅😁
When I subscribed to Toyah at the start of the lockdown I was like the 6,000th subscriber, something changed in the last few months, I wonder what ...
I just LOVE these two, they brighten my day.  Thanks, Toyah and Robert.
Hahaha! N1:-D
Damn black tape
That tapes gonna hurt when Robert rips it off with his teeth!
What is she going to do with that club?
un petit coté " orange mécanique " je vous adore !! good save the queen ...
フリップ先生の爆笑！こっちも笑っちゃいました！(笑)
Gilf
great to see the girls back, way too much tape!
Nice to see the four of you.
Made me belly laugh ...these two I tell ya...got to love what they have...absolutely WendyFul ...I’d say a tad bit excessive with electrical tape.
Robert was distracted, hell I was distracted. I had tunnel vision. What was this weeks video about.
Reinterprets the term "The Milk Of Human Kindness".
Thanks for cheering me up today. Made me laugh! I love the fact that you two are clearly so in love.
Best thing ever ! Had covid jab and feeling a bit wonky. Robert is a very lucky man ! 🖤
She's got it taped.
Hey guys.  Just woke up in California Sunday morning. Love you two.  I’m 52 however you two make me feel young again.
That was just bostin in the take-off, Toyah!  Robert’s response, followed by yours, was so comical.  😂
Good to see they are holding up well during the lockdown🤣💙✌
Dident see that comming 🤘😁
I so look forward to each Sunday, such fun 😉
Toya "Rob i found an old roll of gaffer tape and a truncheon, what shall we do with it?"😳
I love Toyah!!!
Can’t tell you what I thought she was holding
I watched an old episode of Tales of the unexpected with Toyah in it the other day
Is there a threesome going on then guys ! 😕
Just happened to have a billy club handy.
Love it :)
Like your version Toyah I would buy that
Mr F would have just about got away with that one  if Mrs F hadn't corpsed :-)
Wtf
Welcome all to ...ROBERT & TOYAH'S  FLYING CIRCUS
Isn't it about time you went the full monty Toyah ! 😵😰🍌😱
Mr. Fripp playing Toxic by Britney Spears is more than my heart can take, and more surreal than the oddest Dali piece! I never thought I would live so long.
Well Toyah!! .... I sincerely HOPE you're NOT!! trying to see poor Robert OFF!! .... (How's his Ticker?) .... Must be in pretty good shape I reckon ;-)
もやはこれを見ないと週末を終えられない体になってしまったのかもしれない。これ以上に刺激的なモノなんて存在しない気がする
You two are such fun...thanks Toyah n Robert.
That looks a dodgy instrument in your hand Toyah ! Like the top though !
Spoil sport 😉
Toyah, time for auto tune. Maybe some echo luv. No dis, love the fun.
Once again great guitar work from Fripp !!
#FreeBritney yo
My gode !
Well, he had a good reason to be distracted.
I just found out about these videos and Toyah is my newest favorite human.
Roll on June.... Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini......😁😁
Be careful when removing that tape!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Funny, I used to abhor Sundays...
This couple is just too much fun, wish they were our neighbors.
Sexy as fooff 😃
What a riot.
I'm assuming a hint of Alexander de Large  in that outfit? (clockwork orange) I think sellotape would have gone better though ? 👀
Best Sunday Lunch :-)
At this rate these wonderful sunday shows will need a new home soon A++
Brilliant
Robert's face!😂
Wow
Free Britney. And what ever the other one is named, too.
Who is the threesome man?
I’ll take a free Britney, it will go nicely with my free Nelson Mandela.
When you need to get ya tits out for likes ffs.
she likes the weapons few weeks ago it was a swordstick what will it be next week a meat cutlass lol
Oh toyah I really hope gettin that tape off didn't hurt to much...did u get Robert to pull it off??....he's a lucky bugger ..luv ya both...x
You two are priceless! Very enjoyable
My only wish was no tape , what a sexy lady x
good choice! waiting for Geri Halliwell's "Look At Me" ASAP! :D
Toyah certainly keeps you entertained. Maybe the next one can be stockings and suspenders!! A rocky horror themed song,  Just as a suggestion.
Listened to Britney when I was in school. Listened to King Crimson when I was in college. Now it's all come together.
Words fail me
phil has is eye on you sister :)
You both are so awesome!  Happy Sunday. ♥
OOh Ahh Just a little bit........More more more.....How do you like it???
Ol Robert looks petrified looking at that truncheon. He's thinking I AINT TURNING MY BACK ON ER TONIGHT WEN WEEERE IN BED
Good Morning... Free Britteny.
Toyah and Robert a match made in heaven 😻😻
A play on words with cockney rhyming slang: #free those Britney Bits. Sorry Toyah +Robert you can delete.
I predict this one's going to get a lot of views!
Classic Toyah and Robert. If The Queen and Phil decide to retire then I think you two guys should take over is out greatest National Institution.😂😂😂💝💝💝
Have a nice Sunday. Ciao. ;)
What a fantastic pair they are ..
I love those guitar arrangements!!! That song wins a lot as a Power Rock song for me :-)
jesus murphy
Robert's a lucky man.
Guys, we love you!!! Thank you from Thailand XXXXXX
Love You Two ! Peace and all good and wonderful things ! x
Another great performance. Toyah & Robert, please know how much I look forward to your online appearances. Thank you. You appear to be such a fun couple.
Amazing
Oops... You did it again;-) Thank you Robert and Toyah for the fun lunch you prepare for us every Sunday!! It seems you even have a sous chef for menial chores ;-)
I always thought this song was out of character for Brit & Co. It actually is a great song with a very interesting melody that a Rock or metal band should cover?
She's gunna kill him...what a way to go ...more outakes..that shows he don't need blue pills😉😎she's an😇
Just brilliant watching the two of you having fun. Made my morning! 🤘🏻
Love it, you're nuts you pair :)) ~ I've a couple of photos somewhere of you Toyah when we interviewed you rehearsing for Midsommer's Night's Dream in Regent's Park, sitting on a moon prop I think. x
Ooops, Rob&Toyah did it again.
mad as a box of frogs lol
Please don t stop your vidéos  Bring ' s so much joy ,hapiness  💯💯💯💥💥💥💫💫💫🥰🥰🥰
Who two sure put a smile on my face with your antics. Thank you thank you thank you.
Loving the eye make up Toyah and i think more out takes needed me thinks! Marc in Bletchley Towers xx
This works quite well as a rock song!
The tape has to go
She’s smashing female stereotypes.😂
Britney Fripp and Toyah Spears. Toxic!
Toyah!!!
Anyone else dismayed that they have a dishwasher but still use a rack for drying on the worktop?
Nice one
Love you two..  sunday fun 💞💖💞
Love ya', Toyah, but you're better than this, my lovely.  The fun and the singing is all we really need.
I hope when she pulls that tape off there's something left for next week
Brilliant guys made me smile x
Brilliant as always, you wonderful folks make my Sundays worth getting up in the "morning" (0230.)
Toyah gave a brilliant performance in 'The Tempest'!
Lovely as always Toyah👍👍👍
Executed with precise  professionalism... Toyah's  baton scared me a bit 😨
Bon appetite luvvies xxx
Fucking tape
Good afternoon people.. Hahaha 😂 haha.... Get on my love... Err me dear... That's alot of black carpet tape.. Hahaha... I think Robert has finally lost it... And. Both your cheeses have slipped off your crackers.... Hahaha 😂.... Toyah.. My god.. Your getting better with age.. Not like you bloody have aged.. But soo funny.. In fact.. It's better then.. Britney... Glad to see your human and  still. Making me laugh.. Let alone everyone else.. Anyway love you all.. Now go and have your lunch.. Hahaha 😂.. Take care.. Many thanks Devon pirate Paul stuck in Jersey Channel Islands. Hahaha mental
I think we all know where that 'truncheon' is going this afternoon.
incredibly hot; so hot
ahh yes! the b00bs! we come for the b#$bs! congrats from Brazil Toya!
Groodi :)
Ha ha. The bloopers are hilarious!!! Watch to the end. Bonus footage.
Clockwork Orange but Toyah is the Milk bar. 👀
When you have been married to Toyah for 35 years it takes a lot to distract you from playing...but it's still possible
Mmmm a nice pair of hold ups, with a mini skirt and no sticky tape for lunch next week please 😂👍 The perfect funny medicine to get rid of these lockdown blues. Well done you two 👍
Toyah, I'm just recalling your Oscar winning performance in "blue marigold" tales of the unexpected.....awesome
Don't Stop.  Love U Guys!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha bloody brilliant, made my day, that has. Stay safe folks 🙏❤
Pointless
Keep rocking guys!
Who’s Britney ?
Well done guys. Made my Sunday too.
LOVE the eye - too much tape..........
Amazing Homage you two!❤️👍❤️😁 Needed that outtake!!! Just in case Britney needs anymore reminders! ❤️🙏❤️😉
Well... I heard someone playing guitar
There are two reasons I love these videos.
how long did it take you to realise Toyah is wearing a hat
Again a delight, full of joy and talent. I don’t know if Robert finds it harder to not break up or to play....my bets are on the former!
The founding member of King Crimson doing a Britney Spears song....how much time is left in the world🤔
Fun!
I hope you guy's have as much doing this as much I have watching!!! Have a great Sunday Lunch!!!!! Love you!!!!
Sweet Jesus,Toyah!!!!
Robert`a laughter is PRICELESS !
No wonder people don't want lockdown to end
Brilliant x
They finally finish and ..... Toyah "Right just going to nip down to the corner store. Back in a bit." Nieghbour mows cat.
Tickles me everytime his laugh,, gota be the trademark for the videos
Sicuramente più sexy di brit
Brilliant! More outtakes please! 😻
Brilliant 😂 Cheers 👏🏻👏🏻
That  reminds me  need  some  more  insulation  tape😃
You guys are just the best 😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
they finally broke robert
Maravilloso
Ahhh come on Toyah...!!!
Very very funny 😀
👍🤟👏🙂♥️ greetings from Italy 🇮🇹
Robert was sidetracked? I didn't see anyone else but Toyah.
Amazing how Toyah managed to hold that damp slippery truncheon all the way through without dropping it
Happy😆
No, no, no, no, no, Toyah, please don't do that anymore! Again, instead of listening closely and watching Robert's chords I was distracted by those two of a perfect pair ;-)))
Robert Fripp:  Guitar God, Musical Aesthete, dirty old man.  (Let’s see Steve Howe do it???)
I have got a truncheon like that😁😁😁
I bet that truncheon would have an interesting tale or two!
Personally I think black sticky tape is over rated!
Coming up. Robert Fripp's tape removal service.
UTTER Respect to you both for doing this!!!!
i want to watch the sequel with the truncheon
Someone thumbed it down before it even played. They must have some real issues in their life. Please send them good thoughts (prayers) of healing and joy. That's all that Toyah and Robert's doing, just sending out a little joy and happiness out to a world that needs it. Thank you Toyah and Robert.
My guess is someone misunderstood when someone said, 'we should tape this!'  Thanks for completing my weekend. Again!
Bloody love you 2 xxxx
brilliant!
After this Toyah is heading to the Milko bar. Then off for a bit of the old Ultra Violence.
Britney definitely needs our prayers....
@Toyah and Robert - good on you for supporting Brtiney - her life has been stolen from her. 🥰​❤
WOW....
Absolutely gorgeous.
Now that’s a different kind of Mask you’re wearing Toyah 🤣🤣🤣🤣 #freebritney 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Don't click away too fast. There's bonus footage, after the credits!
Robert sidetracked I wonder why  Evening all
This is absolutely glorious. God bless you!
I want a patreon tier where I can see all the outtakes.
Ha
It all seems rather pointless. So why do I come back every week after week, after weak :-)
awww...no thumbnail?? I wanna know if there's bangers for lunch 😋
I really look forward to these   Fripcox  moments !
This is going to be epic indeed!
Can't Wait
