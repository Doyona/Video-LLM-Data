My 2nd pregnancy I was to term/overdue through the summer and my favourite things were frozen grapes/berries to snack on, lots of ice water and cold flannels on my neck. I also lived in birkenstocks and maxi dresses lol. You look amazing Zoe, and I totally missed the feeling of my babies in my tummy when my pregnancy was over. I have 3 ages 8, 6 and 5 and I still miss it.
I always used a steampod and I hated it. My hair was so damaged and broke off because of the steampod. Since a couple of years I’m using GHD and its a game changer! I wil never use an other styler again. My hair grew zo much and is so much healthier now.
Hi Zoe, I’d love to put French subtitles on your videos to help my fellow frenchies out there to learn English ✌🏻Drop me a dm on Instagram if you’re interested @lorine_osaure
Gey a bedroom fan it will keep you cool xxx
Planning to start trying for a baby next year and I am loving watching your journey! It’s making me so excited!
Try and put ice cubes in the cold water! Then the Air is even colder
Braiding my hair all the way when it’s hot outside but I do love a good straightener or leaving u natural curls
I bet she’s going to look just like Zoe 💖💖💖
You still get phantom kicks after you’ve given birth that can last up to a year after birth xx
In the summer of 1997- i was pregnant in the hottest summer we have had in Denmark for years... I used the limestone graves we have over here, that are full of ICE cold water, to cool of in - let me tell you it was soooo nice..😂🤣🇩🇰🇩🇰
I'm calling it now she going to look like Alfie
I’m 36 weeks of our first baby, also a girl. We live in Portugal and we got a 4D scan at our normal scan. Not needed to book and pay for separate scans, thankfully. On the first one she was having her hand and arm over half her face 😂 The 2nd one was better and today we have another one. Can’t wait!
I was pregnant with my daughter during summer too and being Australian that summer was up to 40 degrees I melted non stop. My final month I spent in sundresses without bras or in the pool to keep cool and feel lighter…  Good luck
I love you guys and you are my favorite YouTubes couples and you are very very cute adorable beautiful couples
Keep dipping your feet in the pool 😊
Actually I think more pople use Celsius than Fahrenheit, also 35 yesterday but I love hot weather. It would be better if I didn't get sunburns
Going by the 4D scan image you showed us, I  think that your little love is going to look a lot like her beautiful Aunty Poppy!
It's weird how you feel about the movement pp. Once they're born it's hard to remember how it felt. My LG is 2 now and I remember loving it when I was pregnant but I honestly can't remember how it felt now. Bit sad really  xx
Definitely the spitting image of Zoe imo, just based on the scan with her little button nose and defined cupids bow. Sooo cute!
i still don’t feel like this is real, my childhood dream🥺🥺🥺
love the vlog cant want to see another one and if you like strawberries try strawberries sour cream and brown sugar out them together  it is soooooooo goood it will change your life
In Australia 28°c is nothing when I think hot or heat wave, I think 35-45°c. Most people have air-conditioning here. I bought one for my bedroom otherwise I'd die during the day when sleeping for night shifts in summer.
Zoe was always beautiful but she is now next level beautiful and glowing!! They say Pregnancy suits people and Zoe is the epitome of that. Loved this Vlog. I'm 36 and people keeps asking "when are you both gonna have a baby" the pressure is unreal. We do want one or 2 and are trying but people need tk leave us be!! I'm enjoying this learning curve vicariously through Zoe and Alfie haha x
I had my first in Summer, I lived in either aircon or the pool and I ate so many icey poles!!
I miss poppy and Sean in the vlogs. Can’t wait till everything comes back to normal again and we can do stuff
I can’t wait to see your beautiful girl! This is so exciting I’ve watched you guys since the beginning of your relationship and its been such an adventure ❤️ ; also I feel like the baby had Zoe’s nose
I see both of you in the photo but she is cute.
You guys are the sweetest.
I am 26 weeks pregnant this is my second child. My baby does not move around as much as I’ve just seen your baby moving. They say my baby is very laid back 😄
You will miss the feeling of her inside your tummy. Enjoy every moment of her now and once she is born.
nala looks so cute in the back of the car🥰
The Teddy Bear is super soothing for bub when she is out in the world. My sister in-law swore by hers to help but my nephew to sleep :)
Nala was in the car on the way to the scan. I wonder where they left her ?
Only 2 places in the world use Fahrenheit
Your daughter looks like she has Alfie’s nose 🥺
Thank you for sharing this with us Zoe! I cant wait to be a mom and experience pregnancy so I love watching videos like this and learning pregnancy things!
Baby looks like Poppy!
Awwww so cute! She looks more like alfie Rn🥺
I can't express the joy I feel for you both and your baby! God bless your little family🤍
these vlogs make me so happy cause you two seem so happy going through your pregnancy. only love to you guys and your baby <3
Are we going to have a nursery update soon?
Hydration and many naps was crucial. I had a fan straight on me which also helped. Went swimming now and then. Summer babies are a challenge, but our son always had birthday swim parties🌴
It actually good to have your little  sound  cause it soothes the baby to sleep after they are born
She looks like Alfie!!
OMG guys, Zoe,  I think she has your nose,  lips and chin , and the little smile so cute ... not long now though guys x❤
I miss that feeling. ❤️
There is a company that is making a product similar to that where u can have an ultrasound of sorts on ur phone or iPad!!! It’s based in the Silicon Valley!
She looks like Poppy.
Just get an airconditioner for the bedroom like Lydia and Ali got put in theirs. Well worth the money.
Subhan Allah .. you're having a beautiful baby🥺🥺🥺🥺... I could not be any more happier 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I love watching your pregnancy because it reminds me, 18 years ago, how mine was and remembering what all it was like! It’s so cool. ❤️
Living in New Zealand, I finally understand why we don’t have air-con now 😂😭. It’s because of the British influence. Gah! Gets pretty cold and we definitely moan about it here!
I NEED TO SEE A PLANT TOUR!!!! you've got so many!!
I'm so excited for you guys!! All this baby content is melting my heart!
We miss Zoella’s monthly favourites!
Why is having central air conditioning not normal in the UK? So curious!
What a beautiful little baby guys!❤️🤍💙🇺🇸
Baby looks like Poppy
The majority of the world uses celsius
After I had my Daughter, for months after I had these phantom pregnancy kicks ! It felt like she was still in there. And for a moment I was comforted by that feeling, then I realized oh I’m not pregnant anymore lol. It’s quite common! So you may get some After you have delivered! 💕✨
Australian without AC, which is surprisingly common here. Sleeping in summer is hell 🙃
I think she's going to be a beautiful baby! I mean you're both gorgeous!
She is really cute!!
Mother mother has always said “I can say whatever I like about my children but God help anyone else who does”.
I had a 3d and it looks like shiiit compared to nowadays
Ah she's so cute and Alfie is spot on! The idea of ultrasounds being on your phone might not be too far in the distance! Some doctors have ultrasound probes that plug into their phone and they can do bedside ultrasounds! Also ultrasounds aren't harmful to babies at all so definitely could be a reality.
I would love a quarantine favourites video! xx
Congrats 😍😍😍
Are you guys gonna do a birth vlog?
I think she's going to be so small and look exactly like Zoe
My sister was VERYY pregnant in the summer. She got four box fans and sat on the floor in the middle of them. It sounded like a tornado.😂
You should do a video where you react to your viewers baby name guesses/suggestions. I saw that you posted your long list of baby names on Instagram and I got a feel for your style and I have a couple guesses! I would love to hear others and see you reacting!
It's so exciting to get a tiny glimpse at your guys' new addition to the family! Thanks for much for sharing this part of your journey with us! It's so beautiful to see the evolution of both you and Alfie as individuals, but also as a couple! ❤️Love you all 👩‍❤️‍👨🤰🐶
It’s so crazy that 80 degrees (f) is hot for UK. That’s the perfect weather . Once it gets 90 and so-fourth it’s HOT
Does anyone know the exact air conditioner she is talking about?
I know that is isn't hot so much in the UK but I think/know you can offered to get AC installed in your home. It will be be so helpful for the baby and youselves. Climate change is a reality. I think you will find AC more and more useful.
Whenever your really hot, run cold water (or even rub an ice cube) on the inside of your wrists where you would typically spray perfume. Also, try the good old cold cloth on the forehead or back of the neck method ❤️ The pool will for sure be a lifesaver🍉🦩🌊
I had my daughter in August and I was sooooo uncomfortable throughout the summer. Lots of ice water, lots of pool time, and lots of cool washcloths on the forehead!! I also wore a lot of light summery dresses!
Luckily for me the major heat wave didn't happen until after she was born. It was not fun because we didn't have AC. It was better being not pregnant though. My husband worked for an appliance company so we were able to get a window unit that we put in the babies room. We had another, older child that would not sleep in anything but her own bed. It was a long hot summer. People were dying of heat exposure in Chicago. We live in Michigan just around the lake from there.
She looks like she has Zoe's nose! ❤️🙈
I also just straighten it in the summer
get a bigger AC or a window AC. I use a window AC and my room is 60 F right now. I would not have made it through my 3rd trimester if it was too hot. I was also sick the entire pregnancy. You will miss her not being there it will always be a special thing that only you can have!!! Can't wait to see her!!!!
So y’all don’t have AC in your home?  I didn’t know that😱
Don't most of the world use Celsius and only Americans use Fahrenheit? I may be wrong tho but I feel like that's what I remember haha.
It was 35*C when I came home from the hospital with my son, and we don't have A/C (Seattle). It's hard to want to cuddle a baby when you're already sweating buckets! We have window A/C units now which I would have given anything for when I first came home. I highly recommend having them when you're home from the hospital feeling tired, hot, and in pain, and trying to breastfeed when you're melting from heat. Worth every pound. (:
I know she’ll change a lot, but so far she looks like such a Sugg baby to me! She looks like Zoe <3 Also, yes, my grandma never had ultrasounds. She told me one of these days that you’d find out about the gender until the baby was born, so you always had to have 2 names picked out 😆
Just get an AC window unit for your bedroom😉
Two french braids during hotter weather always for me, keeps it off my face and no fuss.  Btw I'm 40 and it is a timeless summer style😉
There was a thing where some company only played the same 4D scans to a ton of people, but they ended up in legal trouble I believe.
I can not wait for the mom vlogs!!! This will be a whole new level of Zoeys vlogs!!!
I compared my daughter’s kicks and movements to like getting hit in the gut by a kickball, but on the inside! It was the best I could do. 😂 Giving birth was like trying to pass the biggest poo but from my vagina.
Where is your phone case from! ☺️
My air conditioner is broken and it’s 51.4 Celsius here 😭
i think she looks just like Zoe! im calling it
The baby looks like Poppy 😍
I was pregnant in summer last year. I just had fan on all time and had cold teatowels on my head n worne cool clothes
This should go in the pregnancy and baby playlist.
I’ve been watching Zoe from the very beginning and feel like everything has just come full circle. So seeing the scan of the baby made me completely break out in tears 😭 I am genuinely so happy for y’all 🤍
I can’t wait for her name reveal! For some reason I’m feeling an L name
Alfie’s lips Zoe’s nose. She is a cutie
I’m 30 weeks and 3 days! My little girl has been as active as yours as well! She sticks out so much. Also, your 4D scan is just so cute 😭
Amazing video ☺️ I'm so happy for you ☺️
I always love Zoe’s vlogs but lemme tell you…I have been LOVING these vlogsssss!
you and Alfie are such amazing people and have helped so many people during their toughest times including me and my closest friend. You came and met me be decorated cupcakes with me after me going through the hardest time with my cancer journey, and I’m so grateful for that. Your baby is already so lucky to be your daughter. 💜💜💜
i love you so much omg omg i’m still so happy for you to be a parent :) thank you for raising me
I never knew that in the UK they didn’t have central air and heat, Are y’all not able to be able to get window units? I was pregnant in the summer but where I live it’s very hot most of the year like on Christmas I think it was 90° I had my baby in November the way I survived being heavily pregnant in the summer was Popsicles, cold wet washcloths and when I was home pretty much had no clothes on And my AC was cranked to the max😅😅
I look heavily pregnant just existing. You look like you just had a nice meal. Not fair haha! Wishing the best for you and the girl!
I wonder if she’ll have alfies 🍫 eyes or Zoe’s 🌊 eyes??!! Beautiful no matter what 💕
You can get a statue type scan, it’s especially for the blind so they can feel their babies.
What do I do with my hair when it’s hot? Put it up in a messy bun. So basically through the entirety of summer my hair is up.
To me all the babies lookalike, they seem all the same, but this must be because I haven’t been mother yet 😂 anyway congratulations again to you both, I’m so glad to watch you that exited and happy!
Try putting sheet face masks in the fridge for a little bit before using them. It felt lovely. And ice packs on the inside of your wrists to cool down. Apart from that I drank Hydrolyte to keep my body hydrated. I was in my 3rd trimester in an Australian summer - 40c and higher 😄
Although it's hard to imagine their little face now, after my boy was born I could see how accurate the 4d scan was and gave me a look exactly what he looks like! Big cheeks and pouty lips (he's 7 weeks now) 🥰 so excited for you guys having got that scan done! Getting close now  Also my last trimester was fully icy pops, aircon blasting all night, and cold showers
what are all the books Zoe has written and in what order?? also i cannot imagine how excited you guys are YAYYY
I had phantom baby movements from when I was pregnant years ago! It was crazy!
She’s beautiful, can’t wait for her to be here🥺💛
Please ask GHD for a coupon code!!!
Everyones having babies I SWEAR.  I have two nieces coming, one in Nov & one in January a nephew in January as well. So many brand new babies 💗💙
I’ve had 2 kiddos (girls) and I still now and then feel phantom pregnancy kicks! My youngest is 6yo!! It’s so lovely 🥰
You should invest in a portable air condition unit for your bedroom that way you’re able to sleep in a cool room in the heat
There were times one side of my stomach would be totally flat while my baby was smooshed on the other side.
you don't understand the amount of happiness and joy your pregnancy content brings me, my long term boyfriend and i are planning on trying next year and i geniunely can't wait to rewatch all of these once i'm pregnant too, hopefully!!
A good suggestion for a hot summer day style for long hair is two French braids into a ballet bun. It looks nice and put together. I’ve even worn my hair like that to weddings. But it keeps it out of your face and off your neck and the French braids help prevent little baby hairs from coming out and sticking to your face. And if you do the bun high enough and use a silk pillowcase or a bonnet you can get 2+ days out of it. So the second day you don’t even have to mess with your hair.
I gave birth end of August and an AC was a must. Also fans. Lots of them. Banana popsicles were my fav cold snack. Lemonade with tons of ice. You’re absolutely glowing and radiant! ❤️
😩 So cute, She looks like zoe, I think.
My first baby was born almost 8 months ago now and I wish I'd been able to have a 4D ultrasound! We were pregnant throughout the thick of the pandemic so sadly we were limited to just the absolutely necessary scans. But this is so fun! You guys are going to be such fun parents. :)
When she is 18 years old you will be 50
Tip how to handle the heat: put your pillow in the freezer about an hour before bedtime. Best thing to hug while falling asleep!
Great video.  My oldest was a “ Footballer in my tummy “😂. Youngest was the most quiet baby. He moved but nothing like his oldest brother . Yes i was in the heat of the summer , not nice so happy once September came 😂  I only had 20 wk scan. Never did 3 d didn’t think we had 4 back when  then. Could be wrong , but i know it was expensive  So many didn’t opt for it .  But technology has sure changed ,as the way babys are brought up .  The teddy sounds so cute 🥰
Hello! I had a 4d scan with my son in early 2009 at 30 weeks that was the first couple of years they were offering them in certain places. It was amazing!
My daughter is 42 now and when I was pregnant with her they didn"t even do ultrasound scans ever . . . insurance didn't pay for them. At one point they thought I might be pregnant with twins and still didn't do a scan. I was 2 weeks overdue and still no scan. They did schedule me for a fetal stress test and luckily I went into labor 3 hours before the fetal stress test was supposed to happen and 14 days after her due date. I never knew if she was a boy or girl until she was born.
Names  Rosie  May Garcia  Tilly  Adella  Kimberley  Margaret  Eilazbeth  Eileen
She looks more like Alfie to me at this point!
To help stay cool we would go to the beach and float on the waves and then my husband would dig a hole for my tummy so that I could lay on my tummy on the beach to dry and stay cool!
she has gorgeous lips
I think those lovely lips look like her auntie Poppy’s. xxx
Aw, She's a cutie! I wish 4D was around when my kids were born.
Soooo excited to meet your little bubba!!
I suffered really badly with the heat, migraines and sickness all throughout pregnancy. I gave birth in December, so summer I used a cold wet flannel/wash cloth, and placed on the back of my neck to cool the blood going to my head. This was advised to me by a neurosurgeon in 2013 when I had a bleed on the brain (AVM) to keep my head cool and body feeling cooler and helped with headaches, migraines and just feeling too hot in general. Trust me it works.   And yes, I miss the feeling of my baby kicking which I thought I'd find odd as I'm squeamish at certain things. But you will get butterfly kicks. It's very odd but I get them now and my son is 3.5 years old. Enjoy it and baby hiccups are just adorable too xx
I'm so happy i'm able to watch Zoe and Alfie journey to being parents! Who would've thought when I first started watching Zoe that this would happennnn, it's been more than 8 years already. So proud of you all! Love you!
OMG the teddy bear with the heart beat it's so cute!!
Honestly, in Kuwait 28 degrees is cold. During the day the temperature is about 45-50 degrees. So hearing you say it’s really hot at 28 is actually funny to me.
I had my anatomy scan during this pregnancy at 18 weeks they measured everything Brain heart and fingers and toes along with all the other stuff. Baby girl number 2 looks and is completely healthy and normal looking and they could 0 issues that shows and signs of deformities. I also did a couple of blood genetic tests and they found nothing in me or baby that could say that baby has anything🥰
I think most babies aren't pretty, lol! They change sooooooo much the first few weeks, for the better! My son came out with his face all mushed from the birthcanal. His poor nose got pushed up, but it changed to normal within 2 days.
Just finished watching Alfie’s vlog, saw the notification for yours and came straight here lol 🙂
She’s so cute ❤️
It’s kinda weird that most brits don’t have air conditioner. You should consider getting for the rooms you stay in the most. Why keep having to deal with the hot temperatures every summer
I remember my midwife saying after my second baby. Wow you have good looking babies 😍😍
The bear with their daughters heartbeat  is cute!🥰
good vlogs
she looks beautiful Alfie!!! don't worry!! haha she's cuuuuuuute :)
omggggg her face she looks so cute already!!!!
Watching this almost 40 weeks pregnant in 110 degree heat 😭
Is it just me or does baby look like Poppy???
It’s going to be so nice for her to grow up and watch all of these moments you’ve filmed of her moving in your tum tum, I wish I could see myself in my mums tummy but those days are long gone! 😂
I'm  watching  Zoe and Colleen  journeys  with pregnancy  ever time  they both uploaded  videos 🙂
Omg I feel like the little one looks like Joe? 😅
When are you due
Does Alfie has ever shown his tattos?
On my 1st there was a heat wave and I lived on cold drinks ice lollys and had the fan on all the time 🌞
Aww her face is so cuuuuuuuuuuuuute 👶🏻
I just kept sitting in a bath 🛀 of cold water to get me through my hot pregnancies xx
🤍🤍🤍🤍
What was you drinking . Where was your dress from
Can’t wait to watch this and eat my Sunday roast😍😍
I had my daughter in 40c heat in Thailand. I spent the last 2 weeks on a tiled floor with a damp cotton sheet over me 😂 eating shaved ice 🍧
Yes Zoe you will definately miss that movement when she is born.  I missed it so much with both of mine. xx
maybe a bed cooler. or a bed attachment for air conditioner.
i cant believe still zoe ❤❤😭😭😭 been a fan since 2016. Bro 😢😭 i feel so weird and old
Hi Zoe your beautiful 😘😘😘😍❤❤❤
i think you’ve convinced me to buy the straightener hahaha😭
So happy for you I can’t wait
