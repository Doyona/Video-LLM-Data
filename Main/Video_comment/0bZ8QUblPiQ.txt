NEW SOFTBALL VIDEOS EVERY SATURDAY AT 10 AM EASTERN!
Red hat looks like rocoo
my nebw broken he leg he was. playing
I'm not trying to be weird but why do you always put Art on your team? He's not bad but has trouble making the occasional routine play.
They did team benny before team Bobby on this one
First for worst best for last so does Andy Sucks 😂
Nice job red hat
Gabe needs to field a ball, he’s on the high school baseball team, he should be making highlight plays, but still he’s doing great
I love you guys
Bro I haven’t watched them for 6 years and I still love them. Actually goats.
Natalie has like zero ambition out there.
Watching Gabe, Lil Kersh, Uncle Slam, and Dallas grow up is pretty cool
bro gabe made like 5 errors in 1 inning
3:12 ayoo sweater
1. Gabe SS 2. Benny 1B 3. Red Hat CF 4. Soup P 5. Sweater LF 6. Red Shorts 3B 7. Rudy RF 8. Spidey C 9 Javi 2B -Uncle Sam DH/Rover
Andy should be rushen
So do I
is  that wwe belts
lol as much as they play it's crazy how bad some of them still are on defense. It's almost like they do it on purpose because some of the errors are hilarious   Bobby not getting frustrated is incredible lol  Love watching, though! And I'd be 100x worse myself
Am I the only person who remembers Bradley Cooper I miss him so much and that how when he got picked everyone cheered
Andy’ has the most perfect teeth I’ve ever seen! They’re literally glistening!
I laughed so hard when sisco dropped the ball
1 time u should say who’s gonna lose to the opposite team
the errors
I want to see more normal Andy or American Andy
Rip coop
Why do you have the big guy in the of?
Man i wish coop was there🕊
What kind of balls are you guys using to keep the game save(i see you use composite bats) low compresion balls?
But where is lil kersh?!?!?!?
The lighter team won
You should play tackle football
You should play tackle football
You should play tackle football
Remember when Javi was one of the best
How do I sign up to get in on one of these games?
Andy should be "Karen Andy"
Captain America and Gabe and Austin are my favorite
Too bad I’m not there if I was in your team would be winning or whatever team I’m on will be winning because I would be heading home runs all the time the score be like 20 does nothing probably if I was that just me I’m not good to bad I got injured before I could go pro
When are they going to do more football videos
No offense but everyone is not as good as they were 3 years ago
Quick question why don’t you make anymore basketball games or football games
Bobby I would love to see you field more since your guys are on a bigger field
Bobby was coming for everyone 😭😂
Why do you
wow andy and gave look so different now
Love the vids stay well! Btw is football coming back?
where is grassketball
hey mr dodgerfilms can i please play in a game please thank you
Gabe is so big now
That almost triple was admirable
Some should make your whole softball team on the show
Gabe is a grown man lmao
Gage with the destroying shorts
I have always wanted to come play with you guys and have fun but you guys don’t live anywhere near me which makes me sad 😢
You should do soccer
Art only does bad when he's on bobbies team!! SMH
Gabe gotta stay in the outfield lmao
Lol omg how did you get stuck with all the insanely obese people and most of the girls?
Nice rob
you can feel the frustration in bobbys voice
Andy is by far my favorite 😂😂
Ay how do i fly out to play
Can we see fireballs glove
I seen red shorts perform better lol
I've been following DodgerFilms for some time since the cooper era. I love how you bring others to enjoy the game of baseball :D
Gave us to good
Fire ball is so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂 and andy

Crazy how gabe was just trynna hit his first hr lol no it’s nothing to him
Infield fly rule he's already dead! 🤣

Bobby that so funny u said that cuse captain American got u beat on that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂👏 that was great can't stop laughing
You should do slip and slide kickball in the summer
Gabe needs a bigger glove.
Can you pls make a wiffle ball series.
gabe can't catch, he can hit though!!
Where’s Lil Kersh?
I would like to play softball with you guys please I live in Indianapolis Indiana

We need a Cisco vs Cap sumo wrestling match...
I remember when Jeff was a mvp now he’s not good sad
i just find it cool how gabe played for upland and im from there
One day there will be a game where Benny doesn’t forget his brush
YAY!
Omg watching cap play literally kills me inside being a first basemen
Who remembers little Dalles now he is like a teen
the look Gabe gave Bobby when he said “I’m not that fat” while picking lineups had me rolling🤣
Papa Cap has lost his home run power
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Where are yall from
Keleb
You guys should try volleyball
What is with the championships
This video was on my birthday April 16
I need to have 4 year old Andy back
Who is algo? You said algo 11
It’s my bday today April 17th!
I swear i saw gabe on deestroying video
MAN, I havent watched in ages!! Gabe and Uncle Sam are all grown up now!
I haven’t watched in a while and I noticed that Benny has lost a lot of weight, good job Benny keep it up!
Batting averages after this game:  Gabe: 1.000 Sweater: 1.000 Red Hat: .778 Rudy: .778 Andy: .750 Cap: .750 Dallas: .750 Fernando: .750 Benny: .727 Spidey: .700 Geo: .667 Lumpy: .600 Soup: .600 T-Mobo: .600 Fireball: .556 Uncle Slam: .556 Shortie: .545 Art: .500 Javi: .500 Mobo: .500 Fred: .400 Nataly: .400 Shop: .333 Bobby: .286 Regina: .286 Alondra: .250 Chartrusse: .222 Cisco: .000 Jasmine: .000 Jeff: .000 Papa Cap: .000  (Note that in some cases I had to decide if a play was a hit or an error, so you might not agree with every single one of these) Also, idk how to spell some of these names so sorry if I mispelled some, lmk in comments if I did.
Uncle Slam is underrated. He has legit power and is smart at 2nd. Art is underrated too. He’s really good in the field.
Bobby! I haven’t seen your videos in years, but your name came up in a recent conversation (well, the other Bobby Crosby) and it reminded me of your fun softball games. Keep it up, very cool!
it's crazy watching these videos it's like living my childhood again I'm 18 seriously tho eveytime I go on YouTube I always watch 1 video at least keep up that good work out there thank you for the memories really 🖤
I’m extremely happy to see Soup back. I missed him in this series
Gabe is so grown up 🥺
Hey just a little question I was wondering if you have ever consider a tripod or get like 4 GoPros and do different camera angles and just buy a microphone for your self that way you can still commentate and play
Captain America is safe bobby
Get gabe to dodger stadium and see how many dingers he can hit
I practice with the feeder team for st Francis there
I lost it when sisco dropped the ball trying to throw it 😂
Man it is great to see gave getting better and better I’ve been watching as long as I can remember and how Gabe was one of the last players picked and now he is hitting like Frank Thomad
Subscribe
Is that fireball or John Cena?!?
I love the new field
It feels like you have the Yankees coaching stuff on softball crew with players injured.
I love it how much fun y'all have win or lose😂

Bobby puts a curse on his players 😂

Who are all of these try hards ,  the old videos were more fun.
I love wwe I like how spidey had like 5 wwe belts
“Get on your horse”
I wonder what happened to lil kersh
We need a fireball mvp run
I love the games from the commentary, to the players and obviously bombs that you guys hit every game keep up the great games can’t wait to see more games PLAY BALL!!!!
Everyone needs to tag destroying so we can get gabe hooked up with some free 11 merchandise.
Wwe

Next game when you announce the lineup you should say Regina1 it would be hilarious to see Andy’s face!
Wow cowboy Jeff was last pick 😳
Dude gabe sounds like lil yahty

Yes Gabe is good but prime Javi
Its crazy the progress gabes made over the years of playing with you guys!
He picks the same people and keeps losing lmao
Im so glad yall are back. Ive missed watching yall
Bobby- "Is it fair?"  Ball *hits center field fence*
How can I play
I think turtle will win
Every time I watch a game, I’m so ready for the next
Bobby is lowkey a bully
Lol I love Andy he is hilarious 😂 but good videos keep up the work
Gabe to good
It is so sad for Bradley cooper
RUDY! RUDY! RUDY! What a womb broom
What does the glitch in the game mean?
Are you playing on this field to reduce the number of home runs? I’m just wondering.
Hey Benny or Bobby can I join your guys is squad I’m 12 years I LOVE your guys content so can I please be in all of your videos that you guys are going to post

I miss the short feild a lot less higgh scoring games
Gabe’s wearing destroying shorts

Hi
You should do the On-Off season softball league again.
Fire ball gives me green goblin vibes 😂
Cisco kinda reminds me of Pablo Sandoval
Let’s go new video!
lets gooo
Gabe is wearing the 11 shorts
it would be funny  if they made gabe the last pick next game
Bobby , you will never see this but I've have been wanting to play with the crew at least once , I live in the LA area
Since when has these games become defense optional? Gabe is a good hitter but a sub par defensive player
Gabe is a Miguel Sanó guy.
YAYYY
Glad to see gio and mr latin power back 💪🏼🇲🇽
