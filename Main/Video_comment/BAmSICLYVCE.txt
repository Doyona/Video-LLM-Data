Your opininn
Messy meg way out of her league. Even her kids seem. SLOW
Oprah should have known better. Meghan is a trouble maker.
I guess Oprah didnt know that Megan had a toxic personality then. She interpreted things based on her toxicity..She thought she could go control or manipulate them as she did with Harry. Feel sorry for Harry !
Old news, why do we want to read all this again.
You forgive the devil with the smile and attack the abused
Harry and Meghan are liars
The palace is hosting party's for the tabloids  The UK institution is rasist
Love prince William ❤
William ❤❤
Harry n Megan seems treated badly
Bs. Why would Harry and Meghan lie? They didn't even defend Meghan from all the racism, bigotry and xenophobia thrown at her.
She's white, he's white, what's the issue?
I really don't care about the colonizing inbreed royal family.
Please check ancient royal families facts. Having a smart, active and just younger prince like Harry can be deadly. Harry moving out is a better decision. Many prince's have done it in the past.
Hummm.....racial inclination are evident in the British family and their employees. Having a smart loving and just younger prince in any Royal family can be deadly. Just check ancient historical facts in different Kingdoms and Empires. So, William may be not innocent as we think.
Oof…when you here “not yet, but we will be.” I have a feeling Prince William probably was going to reprimand Harry for his unprofessionalism.
Yeah right
It’s so clear to see the equivalent behaviors of Meghan and Amber Heard. She lies and doesn’t care that she will eventually be found out! as long as she gets attention when she wants it. Oprah should be ashamed that she fell for it, all for ridiculous ratings.
Ppl lie all the time.
Many people speculate on who a baby will look like. Eye colour, hair colour. Why is it racist to speculate on skin colour too?
When love leads 2 astray, failure on some level is almost always imminent
I betcha it was his dad who said that..I saw a quick video of Charles standing at his desk a crumb of a cookie was on top of his desk..instead of picking it up and throwing it away in the little trash can beside the desk..Charles had a survent from across the room to come do it... Someone that treats people like he owns them bothers me...So my guess is...Charles made that shocking comment
"we are not racist" proceeds to keep the jewel they stole from Africa
I prince William and Kate I support him and I was happy for family Tiana Marie Rodriguez
Oprah overacting. Megan sounding fake. Harry looking like a victim. Poor things- give them more attention and money
Ridiculous 😷😷
Media is Trash ! Its full of dummies
Ive yet to see more diversity in their ranks even work force tho
William is such a coward
The colonizer family is not a racist family? Sure.
So sad for the Royal family that they have this division just because of one actress that no one ever heard of until she rose to fame by trashing the Royal family. Harry is no better for betraying and trashing his own flesh and blood.
Is Prince William going to do anything with that awful looking bald head?! It is so creepy!! Shave it all of or get hair transplant!! It’s not a way a Prince especially should look!!
this was the moment I thought harry and meghan were stooping so low. boo.
Dude look at the transcript, it's not even close to the actual subtitles
DAMN YOU ARE...
Even Oprah should be ashamed of that interview. I never thought she would sink so low, but she did.
That interview just confirmed how low of a person Meghan is. I wish she had unalived herself. She's a horrible person. The royal family has never been racist and everyone knows this. That's why Harry won't say who bc no one did!
Harry and Megan are disgraceful! Playing that RACE CARD was a diversion, knowing Oprah would on her GLORY! Hope King  Charles rids their titles & any future money
YES THEY ARE
Harry and his wife did their family bad. What a shame.
Hypocrites !!!!!!!!
The royal family are racist. They were against the anti discrimination laws in the uk and don't employ ethnic minorities. I love how they have the token black women all of a sudden. Such a pr move.
Meghan is a drama queen.  Henry will understand this reality but it’ll be too late… poor Henry, you have a gossiper wife (just talking bad about royal family everywhere) and have no country and no family… you made a huge mistake, Henry!..
https://youtu.be/inprXHU-5RU
I’m even impressed that he responded with respect lol 😅  Such a class act! Watch how This all thing made people love and respect Will and Kate even more
One thing for sure is one holds more power in silence lol cause the rest of us will always be wondering how they really feel and what they say to each other in private. For the ones who go publicly you give power to the public to decide whether or not to believe you
Then why don't they give  title for their baby....before they left he born right....
Harry & his boss are a disgrace. They are traitorous and should stay in the USA . They are not welcome in the UK .
Remember the Queen approved them. The remark didn’t come from the Queen.
Every Institution or Home has a set of rules.   The new comers should abide, this is also same in offices.  No new entrant can change rules in   any office or home.
Very sad this marriage   though well accepted  is not  reciprocated by the couple  there seems to be no joy. Two different  races  two different  continents, two different  life styles  bound to be simply troublesome
No  duty  No Job but want to live on tax payers money is that possible ? Dole is not allowed. Very unfair.
The new lady entering the family has definitely chances of breaking  the family, it's not unusual.
Baba ako Jana ktk video inaonyesha kakataa kumpa mkono mtu mweusi ,how comes you are saying it is not racist family?
I love the way Prince William responded to the question that was asked.
Ugh I just can't pass that Megan and her Hollywood ways.
The royals are crazy they just are appearance and hypocrites.. well look how Diana ends..
But you are a creepy one.
A family that enslaved thousands of Africans not racist? I believe they are racist but they aren't going to show that in this day and age. I'm no fan of Meghan and Harry or any of rhe royals.
English Closed caption is all mess up
The royal family would have not agreed with the marriage at all if they were so concerned with what the offsprings color will be.
Stop the Meghan hate .. I bet if the people was in her shoes experiencing extreme racism you would want to speak out..... If William was as such as what others saying why he not saying why can't we both be kings!! Break this tradition.... But ppl mind is clouded .. & i bet half these commentors are from Eruope..... Americans we don't judge cuz we not behind the scenes!!! We not there physically so we CAN'T speak on it..

How harry could sit there and participate in trashing his whole family is beyond me. He is a disgrace along with narcissistic wife of his, I don’t even know how she has the nerve to show her face at our beloved queens funeral
Harry married the ugliest woman in the world
Maybe Meagan is helping him become stronger for him self ... we all have family issues you can't always blame the girlfriend  if he's been feeling a certain way ... Everyone in the royal family fronts who they really are ... I give Harry respect right or wrong for speaking his truth
royal and gracious
Who would ever admit being racist 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The colonial history is in stark contrast to his statement.
Train wreck all away around, from going “outside” family dynamics to getting an ambulance chaser to blow up issue, for her clicks, to “the firm” which demands to Control Everything, media, relationships, lives.  The “firm” business is 50 years ago and known to Hide Everything of a family that has Lots To Hide over years.
It’s off topic and I’m not Megan Markle fan but after all these controversies I admire Harry more because he stood up for the person he loves despite of everyone’s badmouthing and gossiping about her. I think he is very loyal and good person.
William never liked Megan and he wasn't welcoming her into the family
John 3.16 kjv 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
isn’t it always amazing that it’s entitled, white men, who want to say there’s no racism. How would he know? He’s not the one racism would be pointed towards. All he could ever say is, “yes there’s racism in our family. Or, I don’t know if there’s racism in our family.“ If he’s never been someone of color, he would never know if racism exist towards that person. All white men, need to shit up when it comes to racism, because they will never know what it’s like. Just like they will never know what it’s like to be the target of sexism. Hey work lite Willie, Shut the Frick up. Hello
A family known leading a nation to colonize and in slave people, a family that has stolen and refuses to return artifacts to several nations and ethnic groups, and your telling me their not racist...
Meghan is not even dark skinned
My heart breaks for the Queen & William especially. Harry has deeply hurt so many who love him.
I didn't expect him to say anything differently than what he said. Given his position, he has a script to adhere to because of the image of the monarchy where image is on the throne and truth is on the scaffold.
Princess Smollett 🤥 needs to apologize.
The Royal Family are totally racist and discriminatory. Disgusting 🤮 ppl. Good for Harry and Megan to leave that toxic ppl 👏👏👏👏
Every racist people in America said they are not racist.
You've never seen a royal that is black I'm sure all your cleaning people and kitchen people are probably a minority. So answer that question for us? And that doesn't mean you're racist but it just means the monarchy is set in its way. I love history and I love all the movies or I've watched so many movies in the library of the just love to see the brothers back together again.
Of course they are racist
Now they release another Meghan Markle scandal (bullying investigstion report) to cover up-- Prince Charles receiving 3 million USD cash from the Middle East Royal to earn british citizenship. I predicted this.
Offcourse these people must be done that racist those other country people facing this
Thank you Meghan Markle for all your lies!! the whole world knows your true colors and horrible intentions witch.  You just made the royals more loved and famous than ever!! And you are just a bitter liar that nobody can stand 😂🤣
It was probably an innocent comment , you’d be intrigued what the baby would come out like as he’s ginger and she’s mixed race
Harry and Meghan didn't say the Royal family was Racist.....someone in the family had concerns about SkIN COLOR!
👏👏👏👏👏
If they were racist they wouldn’t have agreed to Harry marrying u know who in the first place!
just as the wise man once said "give a women a bag of gold and she will complain how heavy it is".  Meghan literally married into the royal family of england and still complain and lies about this and that. Hoooly.
damn harry why you let an amber heard supporter into the royal family
If the royal family were racist they would NEVER have allowed that wedding to take place!!!  They would have let Harry and Megan carry on for a bit and then breakup under personal reasons.  Do you think the RF would have let her into the family into such intimate conversations and events if they were racist?   Megan has the audacity to talk about how bad she was treated when she broke it to her ex husband that she wanted a divorce through a text message.  Narcissist!! And Harry has proven he’s just an idiot. Sorry but he is.  Going on national tv to bring down your own family… the same family that provided you with a life of living standards that billions can only dream about.  Perfect example of someone whose self worth is beyond egotistical due to his entitlement…
I also dnt think the true Royals are racist  its the workers the subjects who appoints themself sometime as mistresses of the Royal Men and wish their daughters could be the king concubines like the Great King David in the bible
the entire world knows the royal family is NOT racist.  shame on oprah gor not saying so
He wasn’t actually supposed to be there with Catherine she was supposed to have a solo engagement but he knew she was going to be attacked and hounded by the press so he joined her at the last minute he is very very protective of his wife and children and he will not let anybody mess with them he’s known to have a very vivacious temper I mean it’s scary to the point where Charles is afraid of him and I believe his uncle Andrew and his brother are also terrified of his power his temperament
Racism comes in many forms, blatant or otherwise. Most of time it comes from an ignorant place. I 100% believe Meghan, this family has 0 black people in it, of course there’s racist undertones. They may not even realize what they're doing is racist due to lack of exposure to black ppl.  Stop bullying this girl.
The Baby Archie  is not dark skin !
Like he would say, Yes, yes, we are racist.  There's racism in the royal family. But we don't know who exactly. Just the way, there'll be classism also.
Masked Muppets
LMAO the entire monarchy throughout history and to this day has been built on colonisation and racism but sure keep telling yourself otherwise. Or just say you’re racist get it over with.
I’m pretty sure that racist comment came from one of the elders in the family not his brother
Harry is so wrong to talk about his family. He should just leave the royal family alone
I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR WILLIAM OR KATE. THEY NEW WHAT MEGAN WAS GOING THROUGH. BECAUSE THEY WERE A PART OF IT. WE IN THE SUSSEX QUARD NEW THAT IT WAS BAD BUT UNTIL THE INTERVIEW. WE LEARNED IT WAS WORSE THEN WE THOUGH. THE WORLD. WAS.  TOLD JUST HOW BAD IT WAS. NOW THEY HAVE STARTED WITH THE SMEAR AGAINST THEM. ITS NOT WORKING. HARRY AND MEGAN TOLD THE TRUTH. AND WHY THEY LEFT. THE PUBLIC. NEEDS TO KNOW. I AM GLADE. THEY TOLD US. IT MAKES SENSE. NOW. BECAUSE OF BEING JEALOUS. AND MAKING THE RF LOOK BAD THEY WERE JUST WORKING. HELP OTHERS AND HAPPY WHILE DOING IT. MEGAN LOVES WORKING. AND LOVES PEOPLE. ITS SAD THE RF AND THE FIRM. DIDN'T. UNDERSTAND THIS.
She claimed that she could never do anything that would bring harm to her child…but then notice how she contradicts herself by saying that she was constantly suicidal while pregnant with Archie... 🥺she used “suicide” as a ploy to garner sympathy from the public and (along with her false claims of being racially discriminated against) to manipulate Harry. Not to mention the stunt she pulled in Texas- another shocking, desperate display of how far (and how low) she will go to satisfy her voracious, internal hunger for public adulation/attention.
MEGHAN MARKLE = ENVIOUS PATHOLOGICAL LIAR!!
Well of course they said that because the queen has tremendous power and people don't make problems with people like her. After all the queen makes those decisions  she is the one who is in charge.  It's probably her that made those comments.
Sending Love ❤
Megg should play Anna Sorokin, the fake German heiress who moved to the USA (not Britain) is being run in Netflix’s “Inventing Anna”, she remains in Immigration and Enforcement custody. This real life person is the image of Megg and irony Netflix is running the same plot
I don’t think William and his wife are racist but I am not sure about his dad, uncle, aunt or grandmother. After all they are the older generation.
I never did like Meghan in the first place.  I had a feeling that woman would cause trouble to the family. How can a woman be that evil to tear a strong brother bond just so she can be “Cinderella” in this Royal Family. Your Highness please dump her and take Archie back with you.  You don’t need that waste of space Family Breaker.
Since when do ppl openly say they’re racist? Him saying there not is enough? Nice try!
Id love to hear their claim from their lips, not this commentator :)
This family is racist
Prince William is a brother who behaves like an only child!!! He, of course, was the only child that mattered in that family!!! His bullying attitude towards Meghan from the start was, without a doubt, Williams accurate prediction that The RF would and could never accept Meghan. How messy would that be for poor, sad and misunderstood William and Kate to have to handle??? Boo Hoo..go cry to someone who actually trusts your "wolf in sheep" clothing!!! Americans trusted that The RF would treat our sister with respect and dignity!!! We have learned that William and The RF had no intention of showing honor to Americans!!!!
I believe the media are playing favourites since the beginning of Harry and Meghans relationship to causes friction. I don't think William and Kate or the Queen are racist. But i do think the English newspaper were painting a picture of Meghan as a Villian before her and Harry got married. The English newspaper papers do have some credibility issues. Look at the wire phone tapping scandal Im looking at this from an outsider viewing this from another country. Also i don't like to judge people's  opinions just what the English news media are saying after all there in a business of making Big news headlines who's to say their not the ones creating the problems. They harrassed Harry and Williams Mother that you English started believing and trashing then later forgave. Couldn't they be doing the same to discredit Meghan before they even found out her and Harry fell in love to try and keep them apart. How do we know that the baby colour issue wasn't true will never know we weren't there.All the media was pushing was Meghan was this she was that.
Day after the interview palace sets them up with, not just a black woman, but a dark-skinned one with ethnic braids and an African blouse. Yeah...they said it. You have to be stupid to not see the pathetic damage control from the palace
Ugh meghan.... Its all about you
Well from how much I know princes Beatrice and Eugene have to pay for their own security they have to work jobs they don’t get any payment from monarchy and they granddaughters of the queen
And about racism? White people don’t yet know the boundaries of racism. Why? It keeps changing. My 73 year old black father “isn’t transphobic” but the moment I mentioned not gendering my sisters unborn baby he said “don’t say things like that” as if I had insulted her. We are an ever developing population. Are they racist, the royal family? Yes. Do they know it? No. Megan had a teaching role and she backed out at the first confrontation with her race, bc in America? She might as well be white
And have you seen the List of rules Kate turned into a lived experience? It’s just par for the course. The obligation to one’s country should supersede individuality; people need it. We can’t govern ourselves, psychology is top down, Megan is so American, the moment she couldn’t have an IG account she melted down.
I love these two. “It was discussed how black my baby would be!!” - Harry. WHEN MIXED PEOPLE HAVE BABIES ITS OFTEN DISCUSSED. my sister looks white. I look black. My mother had to prepare her racist ass family for *me* and she comes from a town of 200 with one stop light, which only recently replaced the stop sign. Megan is ridiculous and harry suffers from arrested development
Meghan is the best actor  She knows how to be a drama qween  even the  royal spoke after her
Megatron sure has broken the royal family apart. We tried to warn english folk she was bad news, and unfortunately now they truly understand. She's manipulative and Harry does what he is told
Do you really think their going to tell the people, their racist. It's not the first time, Charles has been acused several times.
When you have to tell someone that you're not racist you actually sound more racist.
17 lies. The Sussexes are liars and get caught for plagiarism and lying in court. They should of been charged with perjury. They are celebrities not royalty. They are about fame and money. Their charity is not going well. I wonder why? Lol
Who knows the truth Megan and Harry might be telling the truth after all racism does exist
I believe William but I don believe Kate. Just her reaction like an wolf.
Neither Meghan nor Harry made any comment about the Royals being racist. Meghan told of an incident where a family member ask about Archie's skin tone. It just shows you how the media and tabloids twist things.
Harry needs to wake up before it's too late.
Prince William never said anything against his brother Prince Harry....😄
She is probably regrets giving her consent to that marriage
I bet they are glad SHE is gone! Poor Harry! I am glad she is gone! Have fun in California Meghan!😘
All because of Meghan Markle! 🤮🤮🤮
I see the relationship between William and Harry similar to this between the Queen and Margaret
Love William and Kate
All this is cooked up and served by Woke Mainstream Media, Not happy that they caused riots and Murder all over the world last year.
Meghan just brain wash of harry she used flirtin harry and she wants harry so bad and when she done got what she wanted she broke his family relationship she dont want to follow the rules and they just leave the monarch after what harry has done for the palace he joins the palace militery because that girl,this really sad when harry not allowed to be a future king because i love Harry personality than Will's he much more spread kindness and he lovely person like his mom, he is fit to be a king's monarch and i hope Harry comeback to palace again
Harry and Meghan dont want to do the royal duties but wants royal family to pay for their security. Talk about 40yr old free loaders
Good for you William, Harry and Rachel are a nasty pair.
Meghan made Kate & princess Charlote and palace staffs cry. She is a bully
William and Kate no worth to comment ..  the death of monarchy.. UK liberating from centuries of oppression and racism.
This couple had no other choice the queen continue to ignore him refused to meet with him while has wife was suffering. What Harry did was noble...saving his wife because they indeed killed his mother.
They made sure they put their token Black person up front as they walked
No one said they WERE racist. What was said were questions about the skin color of her child(ren). The perception was "whoever" asked those things may not have OR very well may have known those questions ARE practices mired in RACISM. How do we move forward from there? We try.
I do believe Willam would except who ever his brother loves, they are too close.
Even Toph Beifong can see he's a liar 😐
Poor Haz, he married next level Amber Heard, just more psychologically than physical.
Go William Go!
Oh but yes you are Will, you are.
😂😂😂 sure that's why Diana and doudy were murdered Because he was egyptian and Muslim....... Lol so get off
Well done! Kate and William.
Just curious, why they never did anything about the media always bullied meghan and harry? Even before they leave the monarchy? I mean at least that part was evidently true.
Lies lies lies , 1)Meghan literally blames those people whom she even met before marriage.. When she was invited for coffee with Queen Elizabeth II she literally got herself prepared on dinning manners from some expertise in China...  2)She always wished to be like princess which she herself wrote in her blog ...She wore Harry's mother Diana's perfume on their 1st blind date and tells she didn't know who was prince Harry before she met him and never goggled about the Royal Family before... While her friend shares a picture of Meghan and her friend posing out of the Royal Palace...  3)Literally after the marriage worth of 56billion... Meghan and Harry are like we struggled??? Simply trying to use these words like Racism, mental health and all to make people believe that they were tortured which isn't the case...  Wait what 🙄🙄🙄 She's narcissist trying to now earn from her victim card trying to make Harry and everyone feel that history is repeating type.. She's been facing same situation like Diana.. Which isn't true and then controlling /blackmailing Harry now through his 2 kids...  Harry feel into trap of this narcissist 😐😐😐
so this jackass is behind this
Different types of slavery !!??
William only the Truth sets a person free otherwise  you're a slave
Are the Royal family a racist family? "Well... historically I suppose it's self evident. Crusades and all that, not to mention the notion of superior blood lines. But every one was racist back then, init. As a family we try to be pretty woke these days..."
It’s sad how people idolize and worship a family of strangers to the point they stand up for them and speak of their behalf. Pretty pathetic
If there is a possibility for Harry to become future king Megan would have played the game differently... so demonic🤦‍♂️
William and Kate Middleton 🤢🤮 hypocrite
Meghan is a narcissist.
Without even thinking if thats what Meghan really said, she never said william or the royals is racist but the “firm” so stupid. Stupid question stupid answer
They're a religious family; not a racist family. The queen is the head of the churrch if Harry's wife happened to forget
Harry is a sell-out. He didn’t need to be , but bound by marriage to a sell-out, he barely has a choice.
Prince William and Kate are true royals, the true future King and his lady such class ! Their focus is always on serving people .. unlike like the attention seeking clowns ... wow such an unexpected fall for Prince Harry ..
Lol why would anyone think they are racist , that’s the funniest thing I’ve heard in a long time , they do not care about color 😂. That’s an insane accusation and just low down to accuse them of that they care about everyone equally .
I wonder if the new baby will be white or black or red haired
My dice would roll on Camilla being the one to say something so random and insensitive. Apparently she's known for being brash...
They're not racist, they don't like her because she was abusive & rude towards them
Megan racist she didnt want nothing to with black people why she force harry to move to USA  except this him and archie's here illegally and should be deported back uk like Mexican and other countries.
Yes lets go pay visit at schools have our picture taken while spending some time with a few black children 😂
British empire ?what they did all over the world during their rule..........they answer better
Well, there is a level of racism within everyone in here, depending on experience and perseptions.
I feel so bad for them
Nothing wrong with worrying about skin colour. The paler it is, the more prone to skin cancer it is. So, I'd love my kids to be at least a little darker. In view of global warming and many sunny decades or centuries ahead, getting darker skin is an asset.
I just hate meghna she dont deserve to be in that family , dude one of the greatest royalfamily in the world she never know the values
Megan is straight up lier, the whole thing is lie her body language shows it all
But let's be real ...wondering about the colour of the skin of a baby from a white and a black person is not  necessarily racism is it ?you just wonder for f sake ...I I am a bit darker then my wife but both Romanians and we asked ourselves questions about how will the baby skin tone will be ...
Typical Me gan... Play the Race card..
How can they be racist when they have black / coloured people right across the world. Do the rest of the commonwealth believe this is correct. One person speaks out and expects the world to follow suit, not even giving the other side a chance to speak on it's own behalf

Everyone should just let them what go around comes around
Would have been nice if Harry would have taken his time in choosing a bride like William, did with Kate, If Meghan was humble and grounded and learned what it was to be a Royal she would have been excellent to the Royal family, I am soo disappointed she didn't give it more time, communicated more with her new family than walking away and proclaim how unhappy she was, there is a price a Royal will pay when they marry men or woman who did not have Royal knowledge. All I wanted to see was her give it more time to make it, kate did and is excelling as a Royal..
If they were actually racist, why would they even allow Harry married her and let her enter the RF at all??
What a stupid question to ask someone from the royal family are you racist
Clearly can see who has class and who doesn't...
Of course he's going to hit back so what does that mean nothing.
Meghan doesn't know wat she got nd how fool she looks while doing all time nd media nd people are enjoying his foolishness I really don't understand why Harry join in this nd how he get attracted to this ugly game of this fool women
To be honest, I am an Asian and i live in Asia. I'm not really following the news about the Royal Family, but The Great Britain Royal Family with no doubt is the most popular Royal Family in here. Everyone recognize them, and love them. And to be very honest, after watching the interview with Harry & Meghan, surprisingly me and my family have more respect towards the Royal Family especially William & Kate. They are really fit for the throne, cause they just never priotize themselves and know their duty well. Its sad to see an outsider, came in and acted like she can broke and control one of the longest monarchy in the world! Harry ? Why are you selling your own family ?
Long live the Prince...long live ☕ and  🧁....long live 🐠 and chips.
Planted
In megan's case I wish the royal family at least acted racist then this separation at least wouldn't have been there.-could hv had a one who had a royal blood ! never liked her anyway from the start.!
So so glad that Prince William responded instead of just smiling and walking away.
It's just sad how William and Harry's relationship became cold with just one interview.
What I saw here , Meghan ruined Harry 😔
She should have said as dark as mine...she feeling inferior about her skin tone is not the royals fault.
If i were to choose i wpuld love and want MEGHAN MARKLE TO BE THE FUTURE QUEEN THAN KATE MIDDLETON
William and Kate😍😍😍
Like he will admit it. They have conquer BLACK COUNTRIES AND ARE COLONIZERS
Actually meghan is fair skinned without a single black feature and Harry is whiter then the marshmellow man. How dark their kid could come out?
What a dumb question
Harry, for your information, Prince Charles and Prince William don't want to leave. They love their country, and love their duty, unlike you, who left. Please, don't speak on behalf of your father and brother. The British Monarchy is solid.🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧❤❤❤
She's crazy.  My ex did the same thing. Alienating me from my family and control freak from hell.  Wonder if she has started the physical and emotional abuse that comes with these abusive psychos?  She's more trouble than she's worth.  Poor Prince Harry!!
yes they are in a different path,PRINCE WILLIAMS WILL NEVER ABANDONED HIS PEOPLES,PRINCE WILLIAM ALWAYS THINK WHAT IS GOOD FOR HIS PEOPLE😍💖💞💕
Megan did not say William said it yall over reaching geeh
Meghan is cold and calculating. Perfect gold digger and put up some great audience attention with those “ suicidal thought” and acting skills . Meghan uses people ..... just a matter of time for Harry. The kids will be used as the blackmail and bargaining tool. She is a wicked person.
i have watched so many videos on MM and all of them shows she is such a mean, greedy and self obsessed lady who constantly needs attention and skips no moment for being in limelight,  And Harry is clearly either very innocent or he is very stupid for not being able to figure that out, I feel so sorry for Harry, God give him strength and keep him happy.
Harry has always been one of my favs, he in the middle, of his family and wife, I feel for him,  william is the big brother and he only has one brother.
Lies upon lie upon mistruths and fantasy.  There's been between 17 & 20 out and out verifiable lies that they both claimed.  The more than Harry and his wife continue with their petty selfish lies for their own SELFISH attention seeking reasons the more people are NOT going to like them.
Meghan Markel is reincarnation of Wallis Warfield Simpson?? And possibly will make use of Royal Family status for personal gain purpose like Fergie - I would not be surprised (if she is just some actress, she would not have multi millions deals from podcast and Netflix).
Disagree no one should be a racist  I learnt I treat people the way they teart me treat me bad get bad back treat me right ill treat you right
No matter what country all people in power are hiding that's why they earn the big bucks for doing nothing
Ask princess Diana are they racist
Queen Charlotte was mixed race
They won't show it.. They try to be perfect. Not they aren't. I am not interest William and Kate. They don't have no respectful to Meghan and Harry. They know they are racist. They won't show it.  Nice try
Meghan wants attention and Harry won’t check her.
William and Kate will be the King and Queen..  They relationship like the Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip
The royal family has black lineage in their family and they never acknowledge it . If they wasn’t racist then why Meghan has negative emotional experiences involving the royals💯
The reality here is the press when they see just a tiny bit of shit they stick a firecraker into it, the explosive kind and light it up so that tiny shit is all over the room.
Prince William and Kate😍💗💗💗
Meghan was treated like an outsider. She might have been mentally tortured and only after going through hell,  both Harry and she decided to quit the royal thing.  They don't want to carry foolish rules and wants identity of their own.  Good.  They have desired not to have any right on public fund of which they are not earning.  Salute to them.  Racism can be felt if not be seen through actions.
If they had problem with her race they would have never let him marry her. Please stop playing race card everywhere.
Harry is jealous of Prince William and Prince Charles.... he fuelled his jealousy through the narcissistic vengeful Meghan. The Royals have to be cautious with these two as they are trapped in Meghans spiteful plan, so many lies... from calling the Royals racist.... to have been deprived of cycle rides with his father, when we clearly know how Charles took William &Harry on bike rides so many times....never knew Harry was such manipulative  liar as well.
Based on the amount of Whites as opposed to the amount of Blacks at Meghan's wedding, seems she's racist.
Generalizing that the royal family is racist is totally wrong. Not all of them are racist. Generalizing is a bad habit.
Who gives a shit.   I could care less about. Harry and Meghan.   Especially. Meghan.
I dont get it asking a family that is known for colonization of most of those commonwealth countries whether they are racist!!!!🤔
Yes! They are on different paths. William is a true Prince! Harry a whining and spoiled little brat!
Harry is Diana's Original son
Meghan is a vindictive, manipulative, gold-digging, attention seeker.  If there is a racist it is is she.
Prince William and Kate look very strained and aged. There body language is different. They don't look happy with each other anymore.meghan and Harry are smitten, they love each other no matter what, meghan is the next princess Diana..but u can tell some kind of hate happened in the family, queen lost her glue and now the glue is no longer there, god knows if this family will fall apart now
Prince Harry did not say that his brother was racist.
If you married with the 3th class people this is what you get look at the Kate Middleton how good she is
You noticed the step out with a black woman, tactical move by every racist person. The I have a black friend line
I'm feel bad for British people need to accept a person like Meghan..  She should be where she belongs.  That is my opinion.. She seem trying to much to get att like lady D does but Meghan is more like in drama and play victim. I'm so sorry to see this family need to stick with poisonous person like her.  That is not good for an image of Royal family.  I've just be in royal family for 4 years now, I'm trying to adapt with my husbnd's family and not trying to betray them and put them behind me.  I do respect all of the rules and regulations, religion and etc.
This question is not a crime. It’s like Megan’s mother asked her “How redhead my grandson could be potentially?” I’m really sorry for royal family.
Congrats Harry, u let this women insults ur own family
Anyone else looking for Harry's response after Prince Philip death
Racist word is a new Swag or what.
Oh really why Megan is the only black woman in the family 🤔 i cant see any other black members
ไล่ แบบไม่มีอะไร เลย
I got recommended this after searching for William Friedken interviews about the Exorcist.
So sad prince phillip has died shame his grandson had dirtied the Royal family just before this. Very shameful on harry and megan.
My partner is biracial and we talked about the same thing out curiosity how dark our daughter would be
May His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Rest In Peace😭🙏
I believe they will divorce in a year or two after this second child is born
Harry, get back home and get on with your duties! Your grandfather died today and the family, especially The Queen, and the country need you!
Meagan is up for publicity.
William Please..and the token black woman walking beside you??🤥 goh
Teacher in the #UnitedKingdom 🇬🇧 to Class:  “Class,  What do you call a person who judges another based on #HowDarkTheirSkinIs? Class Answer:  A #Racist? Teacher:   No.....’A concerned member of the #RoyalFamily
Its disgraceful Meghan is apart of this family... and shes egging harry on due to his situation that i feel he’s creating an issue.. These ppl are my distant relatives and i don’t think anyone is understanding whats going on and why this is happening.   Harry is feeling distant and pushed away and its all over that 👑 !   Let me help you understand.  When her Majesty passes away ..the crown will go to prince Charles who will then be king... if he should pass away the crown drops to the oldest sibling of Charles witch is prince William ... following me so far?   Now!.. if William should happen to pass away the crown doesn’t go to Harry and heres why and how Harry is feeling this is Fucked up and he will never see that crown placed on him as king.  The 👑 will go to king Williams son then down the line of Williams kids and prince Williams keeps having more kids.. so you see now why the brothers are spatting... The media and the Royals are not gonna come out and explain by detail of what the problem is but that’s exactly what the problem is and then you got Meghan Merkel egging the shit on thats causing more brother and family distance.   I cannot be certain but I’m pretty damn sure that’s what all this is about it makes too much clear sense.   Harry is flat out feeling ... damn I’m stuck in a spot of just being a prince and the fact his family’s tragedy’s.   I feel for ya cous!
Good luck Harry... they should be cut off from all privileges and money..
Meagain asked Harry to 'have a word' with the Queen about living at Windsor. Just to get one over on lovely Kate. Meghan is utterly vile. End of

They're doing what they're told . They continue to help hide the truth and secrets after a member blows them out of the water.
On ne pouvais  pas s'attendre à ce que cette famille royale👑 confirme les propos de Meghan et son mari.  Ils ne peuvent que démentir. Williams n'a pas de choix, il sait qu'il va accéder au trône dès que sa grande mère, la Queen meurt. Et miss la Queen pourrait peut être prendre le micro et démentir. 😏😜😜😜 Lady Diana  qui est parti très tôt, sait que c'est malheureusement la vérité qui est sortie de la bouche de ce couple.

I believe it smh
I cant understand what happen between Megan and the Ryal family but one is reall: this is that the Royal family not rasicism!!!! Megan chill!!!!!
Kate and William are good people and the people here in the comment sectipn should do some research about Meghan and everything she has said in that video there’s proof out here on YouTube and she’s Definition of a narcissist
again. Stop it "People". I will literally report this channel for using "people" and asking questions we never asked and we don't want to know the answer 😂 We are not interested 😂
It’s Kate I bet! She appears to be shallow and jealous of Megan’s natural beauty. She can’t even hide it.
"my family is not racist, we just made our money from slavery and human traffic from colonization,"
You are a thug, Wee Willie Winkie. Examine yourself. Dont use bluster and denial.
Is the Royal family a racist family Sir? Yes, yes we are. We hate people of colour.... What in the actual Eff I'd that reporter doing asking such a bloody asinine question? What did he expect William to say??  It's very easy to throw out the race card nowadays and it does little to further the cause of people who are actually experiencing it. MeAgain has done more harm than good with her insinuations.
Megan needs to grow up!! What a whiner!!!
Anyone who thinks the Royal Family are Racist are IGNORANT!  Megan is a liar....
It's obvious Harry is controlled like a little boy.
Is not about her colour the way black people behave and don’t adapt!!!!
Don’t blame the royal family look at her background and values. Come on be real
If I were the RF I would never have a conversation with those two gold diggers again, totally strip them of their titles and let them live in Cali & stay away.  They are bullies and untrustworthy.
this can be a storm created, since there is a serious accusation of pedophilia within the royal family. Period.
No one dared asked the royals questions years ago now the world is changing. (No one gives a daam)
Meghan markle and harry : we dont want to involve in royal duty but we want a protection and use taxpayer money
I know a lot of people who are just simply curious when someone on the family is in a relationship with someone from another race and out of curiosity wants to know what the baby will look like. It's not racist. My brother is married to a Japanese girl. I'm curious if it will be an Asian baby or a Nordic baby. That doesn't make me racist. It's just curiosity. People need to stop taking everything to a racist place now. Not everything is racist. Bunch of snowflakes

Harry is a chump for allowing his gold-digger wife to slander his family like that for attention
The more you know the Cambridges the more you'll love them. Meghan just wants, intends to take attention that she sorely gets.
Reminder don"t be slaves to evil the Wicked Will be wiped out togther with everyone what not is credit in exstenci of our creator read psalm 37:9, 11, read zephniah 2:2, 3, read in your holy bible 1 Corinthians 6:9, a10, Awake Awake.
Princess Anne is the Person who made the Racisist Remark.
Oh for heavens sake.. Megan must get the hell over herself. If the Royal Family were racist, she would not have been able to marry Prince Harry... The Queen stopped her own sister marrying the man she loved, admittedly back in the day when divorce was frowned upon. What makes you think that she would not have the power to tell Harry to either end his relationship or get out of the family if HRH and the rest of the establishment really were racist!! Megan.. You are pathetic! Build a bridge and get over it!!
You're not a racist family, but that's why they so casually had 'colonisers and natives' themed parties as if it were nothing.
I LOVE PRINCE HARRY  HE'S DONE NO WRONG IN MY EYES  💞
i do not know anymore who's telling the truth...
Megan, homewrecker!
Prince William and Princess Kate is the epitome of style and grace! Meghan needs to sit down
I CAN'T BELIEVE RACHEL'S  SUSSEX SQUAD REALLY HARASSED PRINCE WILLIAM AND HIS FAMILY..THIS IS INSANE
It was Harry that first brought up skin color because he was quoted as saying " maybe now I can get rid of the ginger hair ,freckles and pasty white skin genes " . Sounds racist to me
I love how the Duke and Duchess and Cambridge would just do their jobs without any problems nor complaints in public! They are great examples!
Meaghan wouldn't tell the truth to save Harry's life
Meghan is just a family wrecker
I'm not even a journalist and caught 3 different lies that came out of meghans mouth in that interview.
*Harry must have known the people Meghan Markle was going to meet and socialise with were out of her league especially after she was caught with a camera photographing the interior of Kensington Palace and thereafter was forbidden to walk around similar properties unescorted. Looking ahead:  'It appears the view formed was: "That if a future marriage rift occurred she would -be in possession of private photographs and information that foreseeably could be sold-on to supermarket tabloids and tv stations. The Oprah W "I was there and this is what I noticed Meghan show" is proof positive that these initial Palace officials suspicions were correct-meaning she had traitorous thought no True Brit or member of the Royal Family would ever entertain and which incidentally prove Piers Morgan nailed her correctly and he deserves all our thanks and praise. Harry was a fool to go along with her scheming and not to put a stop to it, appearing on the show with her was a huge mistake on his part for which he will never be forgiven*
The Royal family embraced Meghan and accepted her into the family, it is not their fault that Meghan did not fit in. I think it is abhorrent how she betrayed and embarrassed the royals. First she wrecked havoc in her own family with her dad and now she separated Harry from his family by airing her dirty laundry publicity.  It appears the drama queen just can't get enough of the drama.
The red head is not part of the family
I may not like royals but megan and harry lied on a lot of things in that interview. Things that contradict themselves!! I respected them before but seems like all this was just for their book & Netflix publicity 💔
Such a rediculous and fake couple! They are like 2 dolls who walk around doing nothing! And of course not only he is a racist like all of them, but a liar also!
Wrong question. Ask him “Which of your family members is racist?”
They already split from royals now backbiting..
Well a family bond has been broken all thanks to her
Harry must be really dumb
I am mixed asian-european and gay, and used to have white skin. Now, I love the Sun and to expose my skin to it. I eat loads of fruits and now my skin is somewhat colorful. I love colors. And I gotta say: when one person injects ethnic hate in someone else's ear, one can diffuse this negative energy and then this energy will be transferred to the whole institution. I have experienced that, as I got a part time job as a timp in the brazilian bank Banco do Brasil, located in Belém, North Brasil, 1998. When one supposed Regional director of that branch, who surely looked like portuguese, injected ethnic hate in me. He did it slowly (till the third day of harresment. He whispered in my right ear, by getting close to me, as I was getting my boss her coffee), in front of the whole staff to whom I belonged and felt good with. But, as I was not energetically prepared for that awful experience, I ended up believing that the whole Institution was the reason why I was disrespected. Its been 23 years since that happened and for 6, I follow a VEGAN life style. I am now fully aware I was dominated by that low frequency energy and now I feel 100% ready to face those kind of people and digest it, by transforming hate into self love. Because now I know and feel truly empowered, to never believe, not for even a second in low frequency energy. We are all humans, naturally vegan. Unfortunetly, at that time I was addicted to animal based diet and mentally confused and weak. But now, not only I witnessed a physical regeneration on my body, but also, now I feel my energy so expanded. I truly wish that the beautiful royal couple who now live in the US turn Vegan too. That will help them digest that awful energy that still hang on to them and turn it to dust. The Queen and Prince Phillip deserve to see their so loved grandson and wife feeling Love again. They need to witness their prince charming transformed into a truly kind and grown man (vegan). Although all of us, the people, are sufferring finantial instability, we must be aware that Love always prevails. May intuition rise into their minds. May love begin in their plates, because they need to heal. Because the firm also needs to heal. Because this WHOLE planet needs to heal. Because we have an Eternal Source of Light 🌈 longing for us to provide the right source of life (vegetable of course).
Harry is in the Gossiping Path;   Harry & Meghan  Here is Wisdom:  GET A JOB  like every other family  in America and  don't  air  the family affairs in public,   leave your  Father,  Grand Mother  &  Grandfather in Peace.
Gustu nyang sumikat
Ugh when will that horrible woman just go away
Of course they are , they're Brits and they're the one who colonised countries and Made *white* superior . Smh
There is a catalogue of inconsistencies, from Meghan saying that she had a cosy little wedding in her garden 3 days prior to the main ceremony, to lying about when she last saw her sister Samantha. As for the ALLEGED skin tone remark,  Meghan says it was made to Harry, then why doesn't Harry lead the narrative? Why does Harry let the woman of colour air his dirty laundry for him? Can't he speak for himself? No, Harry is much more comfortable to let the woman of colour do the dirty work for him.
MM is just an actress 😤 a trouble maker!
It's not a racist thing  It's an attitude thing
So far,William and Kate is my fav
Im not racist i hate everyone the same
Why would anyone think a bunch of colonizers that profited from the slave trade are racist? They just made their fortune having people kidnapped from Africa and selling them in the Caribbean like livestock.
Pray over the family,
Black vs white
We can all pray for this marriage
Meghan knew what she was getting herself into    I don’t feel petty or sympathy for her any psychologist can read her personality   And making a comment public of skin color can react to a big controversy we are going thru harsh time already with racism and I believe this matter of comment should of have been discussed inside the royalty family instead of making it publicity   Harry only responded because he is very well educated and he couldn’t go against his wife publicly like that so he had to play along to not make her look stupid  Someone well established educated does not make those comments publicly...
We love Will and Kate as always ❤️❤️
Meghan is too defensive about skin color. Actually she is the one who find it difficult to accept it just like she wanted her hair to be straight forever🤭. If she had her way, she wouldn't like her kids to have a dark skin.
This is 'most' unfortunate ALL THE WAY AROUND.  What's worse is that many people are taking 'cultural' and 'racial' sides, without really 'knowing' exactly what happened on the 'inside' of these family issues.  Of course I feel bad for Meghan, Harry, their children 'and' their extended families, and I 'sincerely' hope the best for them.  However, as long as WE THE PEOPLE 'outside' of this family; argue, debate and comment ourselves into 'oblivion' on these matters......NOTHING will get done about 'racism' and its 'ill' and 'evil' effects on millions around the globe!  For goodness sake, wish the people more fortunate than others the best in their time of anguish and family crisis, and let's TRY to 'actually' tackle the serious issues of RACISM that is more 'within' our control!
Not buying Meghan’s BS story, nor do I care.   She’s pushing her alleged victimhood on everyone.   Hard to be a victim when you are rich and entitled.  Guess shopping and vacationing in st barts isn’t doing it for her anymore.
Harry is the black sheep of the family. He is to blame for his immaturity.
Awww how i hate Megan
Like most families, I imagine this will be a forgive and move on within the royal family. It was a conversation between family that hurt feelings. Feelings always get hurt when truthful discussions take place by someone. It does not mean that Harry will be disowned by his family. It’s simply a private matter, that has gotten way out of hand.
That what all racist say, I am not a racist. Because they are.
And they were sure to have black people in all their shots
God loves you, Trust Him and pour all your cares upon Him. Talk to Him, you can lean and depend on Him. We all need Him, call on Him, accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior ( Romans 10:9) repent all your sins and ask Jesus to come into your life. Pray daily, read your bible and get even closer to the Lord. Forgive those who trespass against us, let love flow in your heart. Each day God allow us is a blessing,  be thankful unto Him❤
When i saw this post i remembered the advice my grandfather gave me at my uncle's wedding while we were sitting close to each other next to the music band. The music was so loud i couldn't hear what he said..
Hello  mem  help me  hellooo 😫
William is Diana's son.  They had a tough period when they were young as well as after their  mother's death.  This narcissistic Megan woman who is an opportunist too trying to make a huge rift between Diana's two sons. Megan is not black.  She is of Jewish community because her father is Jewish.  She is very vindictive and her drama show is now for money and she is as forecast previously now playing the victim part well to suit her plan.
That's what racists say bye boo
I have nothing against the royal family but Harry wants to realise he's a royal and should act a certain way and as for he says he wants it out of media's eyes what's happening he's the one all over tv
They're sooOoOOOo racist ... Yup 😊 I clicked all the way here to type this 😱
BREAKING NEWS : William the cheater. Waity Katie Middleton was upset and made Meghan Markle cry because she discovered that William was cheating on her with ROSE HANBURY who is Waity Katie's ex best friend. British Tabloids The Sun, The Daily Mail, Piers Morgan, Royal Family, they all were aware of that and actually they are trying to hide the romance between Willy Leak and ROSE HANBURY.
so we have piers morgan and sarah everard
“We are not a racist family!” . . . Only but when minorities marry into OUR blue-blood family!
Meghan is a lier all she want is to get more famous. Why she's doing that. Denigrate the image of the family if there were problems, why it didn't talk and tried to solve it. She simply limited himself to exposing the family by speaking in a way that puts everyone as racists.
contemplating  the characteristics of a baby before it's born with two very different parents goes back a long time in human history. why is everyone surprised?
All you haters should try & put yourself in Harry and Meghan shoes and see how it feels!!..no one should have to go through what both of them have been enduring!! First they kill his mum, then dislike him for marrying for love!! Trashy royal family then welcome the homebreaker mistress into the family!!🤮
Why wouldn't Elizabeth be racist?  Her father was responsible for the slave trade during British Colonialism and killed millions of black and brown people after they stole our land? I don't blame her, that's the way she was raised.
like hell ur not
Just mentioning the words „dark skin“ doesn’t  automatically make you a racist. „I wondered what the baby will look like, if it will have dark skin“ sounds pretty innocent to me. But some people put their own thoughts in other people’s minds. What you feel guilty about is what you accuse others of.
the interviewof megan and harry are rubbish shame of them
my daughter is in a mixed marriage- I  woundered what her babies skin tone would be -dark or light - but thats not racist thas soeculation
William and Kate are so beautiful and classy. Shame on Meghan for ruined the relationship of 2 brothers!
Yeah he's still in the path for kissing a butt and you said I don't got to
Yeah right they real concerned now stop it
You know the people that seen your family
Just because they didn't treat you like that don't be there and treat her like
Megan life full drama  She want money but she dont want wrok 😅
“We are not a racist family,” says the face of colonialism and exploitation all over the world lmao 😂
No matter how beautiful with all make up and expensive clothes and jewlery...... TRASH IS TRASH....nothing can hide it.
Yaaas they r racist Harry confirm period:
Kate and William will not be defined by Me-Again. Let's not forget about her "yacht girl" days! 🙄
I like MEGHAN ad HARRY' so much. But some of the things MEGHAN said was FALSE. Cuz she talked abut her passport being sieze by the Royals ad we asking dear MEGHAN   how ad when,  Because how did she get to canada  was it  by road or with    nigerian passport. Meghan as much as we  love u. U really owe the ROYALS AD APOLOGY
Meghan is NOT a Princess material even the way she dress up too far from Princess Kate!
👍👍👍👏👏👏
I don't bother watching the video. The comments here tell more drama than the video does
Please he is just embrassed  about what came out.
None of you people watching the Royal family or U tuber commentators ,or UK'S citizens knew what is going on in the family but people that lives there ,but one thing is certain No large family like this royal or billionaire family can ever ever be perfect secondly marriage is different from single life two brother's now married will definitely go against each other that's the trials of marriage not wedding
We love you Harry and Meghan, continue to stand your grown, I'm not shocked at all! Of course there's a problem
Cancel Harry & Me-Can , the 🌎 world would be fine and a lot better without harry, megan, & archie since I'm sure when he grows up he will be just as much of a "Victim" as his Privaleged Mom
Lol
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Megan markle is a toxic in the royal family so sad but true
They put that black woman in this shot to show they aren’t racist 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Go to hell. Y’all racist and spoke on whether or not the baby would b dark as if it would tarnish their reputation. Why didn’t the baby get security ? Why didn’t the baby get to be part of their throne? Like wtf! How much more obvious does it get!
UK welcomed more refugess than US.. who is racist now??
Very decent couple fit to be a queen and king
Whatever.
He's only defending his family, because of his status. Let him do it. After all, he is the son of Diana. Because, if he was the 100th person in line for the thrown....he would break rules, and not care what people thought. Also, if Harry has the courage to tell it like it is, let him be. He did the right thing by leaving the Royal family.  He knew, his mother Diana was killed intentionally....and he wasn't about to let that happen with his wife. If History has taught us something is that, anyone who goes against the family, is a target. Let them be. People need to mind their own business.....they are humans. Just like any human. They are not special. Being a royal, doesn't make you special. Just makes you a target for life. Harry and Megan did the right thing. William is only defending his family for his status, just let them all be. God in His mercy is keeping the grandmother alive, and healthy. Otherwise there would be war for the crown. Cruella Camilla Devile will silentely murder William,  and anyone else who gets in the way of her husbands crown.
Oprah wanted to make some more money and decided to do an interesting interview to make a come back.
I don't care about fake Royal Life style families issue i think they just ordinary human like all but must look perfect on front of public... wtf 😫,, iam more courios with your comment on here guy's!! 🤭😂😂😂
now here's a pair of class act royals
🇬🇧🎏🎏🍏🍎🇧🇭🥰
I'm racist
I felt for Meghan during this interview.  But I cried when harry came out.  Ultimately he had to choose the family he made...when he spoke about his mom it was sad.  I pray that they continue to thrive
I don’t think that question is racist at all, we ask questions about the color of hair and eyes all the time so why not be curious and excited about the skin tone too.
ALL THE ROYALS MADE THEIR WEALTH OFF the colonialism
Very much is telling..
What if Megan was a pure black woman?
Si harry nyari cuan gini amat
Cant stand Harry and Megan ! I don’t care what the hell she says ! She could have left him before she wanted to get married . Ofcourse she wouldn’t be able to survive in the royal family because she’s uncultured  and classless when it comes to the monarchy . It is an institution that gives people hope !  She spouts rubbish about them without any proof but you know it’s Oprah so it must be true 🤣 they were never meant to be together and she was beneath the Monarchy and she couldn’t take it so she insulted the monarchy instead  . It’s typical of idiots to believe her but who are we kidding most of the world have become snowflakes now !  No one in this world can say that I’m wrong because the monarchy lasted for more than a thousand years . Now miss no one arrives and ruins they’re reputation ! It is a vendetta against white people! Plain and simple !
Meagan need to act  real its not serving any point though. This is family.... He who find a wife has find a good thing. Do not put families in different path please.
How surprising that seasoned professional journalists are so nieve and gullible to repeat unsubstantiated heresay and questionable far fetched stories of little mermaid, and rapunzel being lockup in a palace. Without keys or phone and wallet. By mythical men in grey suits. And how claims of racism have been made by someone of dubious character and is being accused of bully her staff while she was in the palace. This all smells of an disgruntled ex employee with a grudge. And a chip on her shoulder. As for Harry he is just an just as disgruntled. A sad pair losers trying to exact revenge using the race card and hate speech by using the media's gullible nieve unethical journalists to do it.
Do MORE talk less
I'll wager that: a) this marriage won't last, and b) Harry is likely an alcoholic and c) Megan/Oprah have depth of mud puddle.
The african queen and her nubian princess are 'coming' for the Monarchy. How entirely classless.
I think we have to have sympathy for everyone in this situation. We have no idea what goes on behind closed doors, and we will never truly know. I am just glad that no one is attacking anyone else; Meghan and Harry talked about how they were disappointed and wished things could have happened differently but weren't blaming anyone. Likewise with other members of the royal family.
Never believe what the royals say they all have so many skeletons in their closests anything public is just a front
Omg all you guys stop gossiping and get along your brother is stay always from u guys cause y guys suck right now your wife started this  now you guys you guys are fighting stop alreDy
I'm Black. I donot believe that they are racist at all. Harry and William was close, I have been following this family since I was in elementary school, I am a year younger then Harry. William and Harry was extremely close for what I saw.  I don't think the Harry and Meghan interview should never have happened in my opinion.
no, you are
i cant believe that Harry let his wife destroy his own  family who always supporting him. He doesn't become a better man after marriage.  He should be wise and not exposing his family affair to a public since Royal family is not an celebrity.  This story is one side story and if the royal family is racist they  would not let him marry Meghan.
This was handled very poorly. If Megan and Harry had issues. It should’ve been addressed privately with family members at the time. But now it just seems like it’s a publicity, celebrity, Performance.  It’s a shame that Harry walked away from his country, his family had his duty! I hope he doesn’t live to regret it! To me Megan it’s just another celebrity looking for the limelight, and promote more income producing performances!
These couples are serving the service while the another are just...very dissappointing
Just only because of the dark skin Meghan step out from the royal family.. Meghan..the Bible said the dark was beautiful, why don't you just agree with the Bible then! No need to feel bad about why the man said about your son but u must excited about wht God  saying about your son!
The two have been right to speak out on the reasons they left the royal family. Speaking out, leaving brings change only if people understand why? Why answers bring change as they enlighten people. Yes they are 2 sides but listening to all sides brings enlightenment. I mean we didnt know thr pain meghan had nor does she know the pain the royals felt having an American as an inlaw and specially an African America. Can we help this family resolve?
To be honest , ,,, silence is the best policy , dont say a word ,  just smile sweetly and carry on ,,,,,   👍😊
He is really his father's son...
Meghan split the two brothers sigh
Mental health is a real concern so i hope she is feeling more herself she clearly felt left out as a person of colour it happens a lot to all of us.  Racism is real and diversity needs to occur much more in all areas.
I feel bad for Willliam.    Even after he and Kate married, he and his brother were close.   Then Meghan came along and something changed.  Even Harry changed.   He isn't as jovial as he used to be.     And for Harry to go on Oprah and just lay out family secrets, it would be a knife to the heart
why did Meghan constantly say, “right,” ? Ex: “I was sad right”
So what we all Wil wonder if we have mixed marriage
Kate and William are really so sophisticated.
The queen is not God, she will  soon meet her maker.
Omg..Meghan came into their lives....and RUINED.
Oprah, is doing nothing but causing trouble, and needs to bugger off. She is too full of self importance for her own good. And I seriously doubt anything was said. Archie will never be a prince because he isnt in line for kingship, and he will have his father's title after Harry dies, so he is not been looked down on. The biggest problem was that Meaghan assumed that she was important enough ti change an institution that is centuries old. That was very rude of her, she really should have paid attention to what Kate did.
William and his wife both are MAN‼️
Mehhhgan is a snake
William class act....this man cheated on his wife just like his dad cheated on Diana...class act all of you say..I guess its ok to be a cheater...
Harry and Meghan are absolutely horrible in their destructive behavior.
They do not belong to this family anymore. They put themselves out of the path. Kind of Edward and Wallis new beginning
Mm
I think it’s very clear that she involves grace to get peoples attention , this is pure seeking sympathy/attention
Megan Markle was clearly out of her league. This is one of the richest most powerful dynasties on the planet. Did she really expect that she would have been  greeted with open arms because she was a black American second tier actress ? The Royal family acquired their wealth by manipulating and conquering several different nations of people for generations on a global scale. Did she actually think she speak to a family who almost ruled the world into changing their ways. Common !!!! Stop the madness. This family is a monarchy for crying out loud which would mean they consider themselves superior to most people period. Think about that for a second. Not just being white but being superior than everyone who are not a part of that monarchy or equals in stature or wealth. Make no mistake I’m no fan of this family for so many reasons however, if you ever find yourself in love with one these people in a monarchy regardless which one and decide to marry into this sort of family you better know what your getting yourself into.
How funny. The family that practically and historically thrives from exploitation of Africa, is claiming they aren't racist🤣..... This family is like the drivers of whiteness and like all Englishmen, they are subtle in their racist deeds. Bollocks!!!! You all are racist
Prince William: The Royal Family is not a Racist Family, we will be hiring Dark Skinned Beefeaters ASAP. A Royal Decree has been issued. Thanks
The media pumps up all this racism stuff.....l wish l could imagine living on earth without it. I experienced it mostly in the military and, my grandkids are beautiful and have a Mexican father...if you ask them what race they are....they will say MEXICAN....the rule was your race is whateva your father is. Her father is white and l am sure on paper she will check the white box.
Shes having problems with her own family ofcus she will start something like this for william
Royal bullocks
They had to make it a race thing that is the only way they can get people to watch this is to say they are racist sad that oprah is the one that is all the time bring racist stuff in to her Interviewer so people will listen and it's sad !! They are both white so why would there baby be black dont make any sense!!
Lol what if it was a cousin
I don't know about racism but I'm pretty sure that some of what Harry and Meghan said was true. There are rumors and other interviews about the behavior of the "Royals" behind closed doors. Since the Europeans are the only ones who keep titles, it is very rare that a royal won't marry someone who's titled. That's why both couples shocked me. Their ancestors were all about "keeping it in the family."
Everything put aside, you can’t deny the type of class that Kate has and Meghan just lacks..
Kate wore a toned down OOTD ? Maybe for obvious reason ?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 dark skin where ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 This woman is NOT  Jamaican or African . She's a caucasian woman, there are many caucasians that lives inna Jamaica. Who gives a shit a bout the British Royal Family who are Actually Germans. So its German family has been ruling Britain for  over 200 years now.
I really don’t like Harry he both of them should never be called royals
To go against own family is not easy, royal or not. I truly hope Harry has very clear reason(s) for it. When He did the interview, he burned all the bridges. He made that first move. He should have a talk with the royal family members about whatever problems concerning him and his own family. Whatever it is, They ARE his family. He has one and only brother there, they've been thru so much together, dont tell me they can't have a heart to heart conversation between them.
Asking if a racist of he racist is a stupid thing.. Of course the so called Royal family looted the world and killed millions in India, Africa and other countries to collect all the treasure and if someone wants to marry a half black woman from other race what do you think will the Royal Family members feel....
If they were racist, Megan wouldnt be married to Harry. Shes alienating him from his family and heritage. How selfish is that
They both have been disrespectful if they want their own way just stop all rights let them become commoners
She is an actress played her part well
With all that money he could easily get a hair treatment to fix that bald spot.
They are good family. But she M is the trouble maker
Stupid video. Just repeating what we already saw on tv.
I get what meghan is saying princess Diana went through the same. Ppl saying "she knew was she was getting her self into she married a prince"  uhh noooo  Yes she married a prince but how the hell will you know how cold the royal family can be. Now this also came with princess diana interview awhile back. Everyone is like omg fck prince charles poor princess diana she didn't deserve it poor princess diana. But then when it comes to meghan everyone turns against her.. why? No one gave her any manual when she arrived she goes through the same as princess diana she was alone .. lonely. Why do ppl turn on her.. ?
This Royal Family works and supports ALL NATIONS IN THE COMMONWEALTH!!  Look at the Nations!! all different cultures....They are not racists.!!!...
Yes he is. He wants to get rid of some of the population in Africa. 😡
I think the reason Harry left the family is that he doesn't want the same thing to happen to Meghan that happened to Diana. And the hostility that Meghan gets from the British public. He chose her to be his wife. Right or wrong, he still deserves all the support that the public can give him. And if the marriage doesn't last, you know the saying, "You live and learn."
THE MOST HIGH BLESSINGS: PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA 2030. LIVE PEACEFUL FROM WITHIN.
Any rasist would say they are not rasist.
They have Netflix. and they don't want publicity 😂
Harry's a very angry individual because he's not number one, and looks to blame others for his mother's death. Immature and irresponsible. Wonder if he will ever grow up.
Why the Quen she never travelled to holly land Israel ?
William : We are not a racist family Me: What about with British Empire LOL 😂
Wanting to know what someone's kids will look like isn't racist. It's just her ATTEMPT at coming up with something bad to say. Congrats my dear, you have successfully alienated a man from his entire family just bc they wouldn't shower you with money.
I do think that although the immediate royal family might not be racist they most certainly tolerate racism. Harry himself has a racist past (I wish this was also addressed in the oprah interview) so it isn’t surprising to hear the allegations meghan’s made. Princess Michael of Kent  purposely wore a racist broach on her way to meet meghan for the first time. This isn’t the first time she’s said something racist to black people yet the immediate or higher royal members said nothing. The very family that has colonized and looted the world and people are doubting that there is racism involved??? The whole empire was built off of racism.
Harry and Meghan brought on all this theirselve
dont they look stupid wearing useless masks... Oh and dont get a vaccine, its made to kill off your Natural Immune system, with out it you will die.
Prince William needs to forget about Harry Windsor ! Sadly Harry is not very bright!
I have dated a black guy which I wanted to marry and I was myself curious how our kids will look like and both families were too. I don't think that makes us rasists. I don't think the person intended to insult them.
Its sad to see them become the cringey gingey & his whingey wife but that seems to be all they are good for.
Married a wrong woman is a disaster! So manipulative & harry just act like a small kid. And majority people know who's the one who wear pants 🤦🏻‍♀️
William should be there for his brother and speak up for his mother! He wants to live off the tax payers money!! He’s like Charles!! Heartless!
Of course they have an African woman walk with them for photos now🙄
got  no  time  for  markle    but   believe  there  is  some  truth  in  what  she  says   .      firstly  the  royals  look  down  on  everybody   as   the  pampered  ,  spoilt    lives   they've    lived   instills    in  them   a  sense  of  superiority  and  destain  for  the  little  people   or  plebs  as  they  probably  call  us  working  class  uneducated    little  people.                                                      secondly  markle  although  another  spoilt  rich  type  could  never  hope  to  fit  into  their  insular  little  family  clique  or  firm  as  they  call  it  as  she's foreign   ,  mixed   race  and  out  spoken .  sorry  to  upset  you  pro  monarchist  types   but  l'm  glad  she  spoke  out  and  rattled  the  house  of  windsor's  foundations  .
God bless  Will and Kate
Shes not even dark, what a baby
Sorry but meghan is suspicious woman
Markle is manipulating Harry
Meghan racist she only respect her black mother but disown her whote father not only that Meghan bullying staff of Royal family and she fired two staff when she was living in UK as a Royal member's
Yes, immadurity,
Your wife kate pusch our beatifull Meghan to cry, what did you say about it? You are racist!!!
You people can try to tell what you want,  but the truth is : you are racist!!!
I don't think it was William. I hope this will not ruin the brothers bond.
The 2018 wedding was multicultural and international, certainly not the work of a racist family or institution. La-La Land meets Ma"am Ma'am Land and fur is bound to fly. Hell hath no fur-ry.
William your brother is a simp and his wife is so oppressed with all the millions they were left.
Anyone who believes this one-sided story is open to just about anything the media tells them to believe.
Where is the hitting?
Been through hell together!?...hahaha
We missed a universal opportunity to learn a corrected way of creating a bridge within a family after insults and intrigue in order to preserve the value of the family and not give up the pleasure of always sitting at one table.  Not wise on her part that she violated protocols and knew in advance where she was going. We missed an opportunity to teach the world how a woman should respect her husband's family and not cut him off from his brother and father. Even though she did so in front of her father and sister.  What will they say to their unfortunate children who are left without a family?  Her narcissism and manipulativeness put her husband, who lacks a spine, in a negative light.
Megh is a Big Snake🐍
Everybody is ignoring  the fact that little Archie who has been completely isolated from almost all of his family. I feel for all the people hurt deeply by this selfish decision these 2 made.  Megan's dad and sister have been devastated.  I'm sure the royals feel the same.
I don't why but I think that everyday Meghan and Harry sings, 'Our love is God' and then start the day.
Not a racist family? Okay.. why doesn’t Archie have a title? That’s all I want to know
of course they will say lies too cause i'm sure the queen told them to shut up and not open their mouth
Ok lemme tell you something. I know its 2021 and no one really  cares about race religion and shit but how will you expect a ruling  family of a marvelous history to accept a daughter in law from another country, without having the United Kingdom ethnicity, of multiple race? Having multiple boyfriends in the past. Tbh, if she had stayed there for couple more years, she would have died like how princess diana died.  Even princess diana had multiple boyfriends that ultimately lead to downgrading the family name and their pride.  And if she was much concerned for privacy,  why is she even attending and interview and crying out about her life in the Royal Family?  There are much more problems in the world. Stop with this bs
Man Harry better hope and pray Meghan don't divorce him then he will be fucked. Is it me or is it a weird coincidence that Meghan doesn't talk to half her own immediate family and now her and Harry aren't speaking to his family 🤔I guess everybody is in the wrong except Meghan wow
I think they are flat out lying about the skin color conversation. It is a shameless bid for sympathy.  If it were true, they would name the  person.  Marrying M-M-M-Meghan was the worst move Harry could have done.
95% of families have at least one member who is racist.  That doesn’t make them a racist family.   The degrees of racism differs but I guarantee you if there is an elder in that family they have been, or are racist.    When I was a kid they still had black and white water fountains in buildings that hadn’t been taken out (or the signs hadn’t been taken down).  It’s not that long ago.  Healing takes time and I’d rather people in higher places be honest than to pretend it doesn’t exist.  Unfortunately there are extremists who think extremism is bad.  Yep...
Like getting a thick sister  to walk by him is going to help out with that bullshit 🤣🤣
¿To Meghan & Harry Interview? donald j trump, sexenio AMLO pan prd pri ¿edward elric? pokemon kousaka riko covid-19 jeringas
What I found eye-rolling embarrassing for Meghan was the complaints about who pays for security for her child.  I mean, seriously.  How much are Meghan and Harry worth?!?  They cannot afford their own security for their child.  The entire interview was ridiculous.  She is ridiculous.  Harry needs to grow up.
Much respect to Prince William and Princess Kate.  I think Prince William's statement was accurate, and I'm glad he didn't take that crap!  Harry and Meghan  have serious character flaws.  They are an embarrassment to the Queen; they couldn't even get their stories straight before doing the Oprah interview.  Sad situation. Meghan's brand will never be that like the Queen's, nor Diana's, no matter how much she attempts to mirror Diana.  I don't wish Meghan ill-will, but she is not good.
I had a feeling this was going to come up.....I knew it....
Queenies best friend was the very beautiful, wise & black, Queen of Tonga. Queen Salote. Who, on more than one occasion, frequented London to visit Elizabeth. MEGAN would have known this upon meeting her grandson in Tonga. 🙄
Every  biracial couple or people close to them always will be wondering what color their kids will be. That’s normal: it’s not racist. I speak for my self an Hispanic who’s married a white guy
Wish you all a good day and take care
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Race is not the issue with Markle, it is her attitude. It doesn't matter what a person's colour is but how one behaves in dealing with others. She just wants to join the racism bandwagon. The interview was full of inconcistencies or shall we say lies?
Not understanding why racism was as issue when they accepted MM in the royal family already. Accepting her alone is not racist in my opinion.
I was working for a white man living in his friend house who was also white. It was part of the agreement before I took the job. ( to offer me a reasonable standard of accommodation) another staff member was staying on the compound too she was white.  We all got along , very friendly very shearing very polite. But my boss friend had an energy I couldn't put my finger on ( the way he looked at me from time to time) I just sum it up to be he really didn't want us here but he too was polite and friendly.  Then one day he came on the property and saw cigarettes butt and beer cap in the pool. He blame me for it and told my boss he want me off the compound. I said I never used the pool and ask the girl about it she use it all the time. She admitted to it. The funny thing was he did not advocate to have her off the property. Is he racist 🤔 the girl then told me its because I'm black that's why he moved so with me.  The point I'm making racism is a gray line , that logic could explain away. But deep in your heart you know it has more to the Person action.
Just a thought..... Megan Markle is making all these claims against the royals yet.......has no problem spending Princess Diana's MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Asian community in the UK 🇬🇧  has always held the Royal Family in great esteem and respect, being the on the third generation, we always seen a very supportive Royal Family within its roles within society one thing that has never been forthright is race.it’s shame certain matters to arise within all families but going on media platform is not the best answer unfortunately Megan has not lost anything it Harry’s family unfortunately she not seriously considered his true position who he is.
Megan is awful
Beware the media news that brainwahed you. Never listen to 1 side story.
Harry is messed up and always has been.
Oh Hell !!! Get It To Together Meghan
Nobody: Journalist expecting a normal question: are you a stupid journalist? Journalist replies: I'm very much not a stupid journalist
They're not racist. They hate poor white people just as much as they hate poor blacks!
I will always see Megan Markle as a manipulative social climbing drama queen who’s only claim to fame was being successful at latching herself to the royal family. I bet next time she’ll be complaining about being abused by Harry so she could maintain playing her victim card.
Meghan brainwashed Harry big time!!
One member of the family may or may not have made an inappropriate comment.  Sounds like the next day recap after every family dinner I was ever a part of.  Families are imperfect & say all sorts of things.  But coming forward with it because after your very privileged life you had to take your place as a duchess instead of a princess NOT because of your race but because your husband is no longer second in line to the throne because of William's family is just sickening..  People are dying of Covid, MM.  Grow up.  Spoiled brat.
There’s a breakdown video saying that she’s telling the truth? https://youtu.be/ukuHjYrA1XU pretty sure it’s because only she believes it but good breakdown regardless
Meghan doesn't care at all..no respect about ROYAL tradition...she thinks "oh im a hollywood actress"...They should look up into me...not me look up into them...🤪 and no one can stop me even Harry...I will do whatever I wanna do... I will say whatever I wanna say... Meghan marriage is not a movie that needs acting...look at KATE..and she is an example of good vibes... soon to be a QUEEN.  I'm 100% sure your marriage will end up in divorce...👌
Look indian have taught before the birth of new child but the difference is that they are dark too. That what British left in subcontinent after colonial rule
Can't wait for the next season of the crown!
All fake and set up. They all actors. And trying to push an agenda of divide, racism and fake virus. They are the virus 🐍
Meghan’s track record speaks for itself! I’m truly saddened as those 2 selfish brats! With Meghan!’s heritage she could have used it for the good instead she is playing the racism card! I don’t believe they are racists! For that innocent incident of what color is the baby going to be?  I call that “curiosity/human nature! I would be curious too! Those 2 narcissists are not welcomed on my TV! They turned something good and magical into the trashy modern culture of today!
i'm not we means one or few of the member the royal family 🤣✌🏼
I hope William and Kate do an interview with Piers Morgan now that would be worth watching...
That was in poor taste, and in front of a black woman as well. I have mixed children. My husband’s family was similarly curious. I didn’t see it as racist.
Racist royal family bloody cheaper
Oooh lord too much BS on the internet 💆🏾‍♂️
The truth shouldn't stun those disgusting royals.  They are only stunned that Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan didn't keep their dirty secret!!!
No William you may not be but someone in that family is. 🙄
Actions speak louder than words
These are billionaires and the can't buy a decent face mask????? Roflol
That's the problem of getting married to an "keeping up with appearances" nagging wife who knows no respect for other people say ethos and values. What do you expect from anyone who doesent show empathy to her own unwell dad lying in the hospital.
Ha ha ha can Megan really damage the royal family? Please. That is the funniest thing of 2021.
Even if they are, they aren’t going to say that. Lol
Two peoples who were damaged inside come together. It reinforces the problem. They make a wall around their selves against everybody else. I thought, that is not healthy relationship.
Let us think:  If they were racist, they would have stopped Harry from marrying Meghan.  They have the power.  Come on let us be real.
Let me make one thing clear. Prince Harry and Sussex Megan never said that the British royal family are racist.  I wonder why William is so over reacting instead of trying to protect his own brother.  Is this what princess Diana really would want his oldest son to do to his own brother? Very sad!
Does anybody believe prince harry is prince Charles son...I think not.
Poor Harry, he didn't know he was unhappy until Meghan entered his life and told him.  Harry and William were on the same path until Meghan.... They are brothers and love one another.  It's a shame if they have to sever their relationship because of _____________ .
Harry was born from an affair. He has no royal lineage
William and his wife Kate are as fake as they come #Classless
It’s so easy to take on the queen when sitting in your mansion and zero worries about next months rent. Why aren’t they complaining about China, some Islamic nations and African nations where they treat women like cattle?
Kate is the normal one from all of them 😂😂
Meghan has no class. It's a good thing she is gone, she is not princess material.
Megyn is a Gold Digger,without Harry she'd  be very poor,hustling g for work.
Let me guess, it was Camilla who questioned about the baby?
Prince William wasn’t “hitting back”, he simply responded to a question he was asked.
UK is built on colonialism and racism. It's obvious that Willy Leak and Waity Lazy Katy are racist
Why do I feel more sorry for Harry. He has no voice.
Why the black woman is left behind. Willy Leak is not gallant at all. Hey William, repeat after me : "I WON'T STAND FOR RACISM"
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, both class acts ❤️
Please explain me why UK has still a monarchy?..are we in 2021 right????....
She never deserved to keep her Title. That is a working Title. It is a paid job with expectations and responsibilities just like any other. Daddy always said never look a gift horse in the mouth. You broke the heart of a nation and got your spoiled pampered demands 100%. And now after all this time you want to come back and rub salt in the wound. There are people in the world facing health, money, real family , real struggles. And you have the gall to try to destroy a monarchy because you didn't live happily ever after. That's called LIFE. The REAL WORLD. How embarrassing for you. Mikey Out. Oooohhhh Yeah!!!!!
HA..........
Prince William  answered too quick. Because they been told it will be sorted out privately.
Click bait !!!
Well, how would they know racism? They live in a bubble.  Harry and Meghan did nothing to deserve their tabloid terror. Harry was perhaps the most popular of the royals because of his ability to relate to people like his late mother, Diana. To my knowledge, unlike his father, he did not break vows, break up families, or cause embarrassment after he married Meghan. Like many people, Harry had all of his scandals during his youth. His party boy behavior stopped once he settled down to raise a family.   All of the royals have had lies printed in the tabloids. However, tabloids generally do not use blatant bigotry and character attacks against them. The exception being the target did something putting themselves in a position for exploitation.  What did Harry and Meghan do to deserve persistent tabloid terror headlines?  Antagonistic bigoted headlines are on a different scale, especially if it is relentless. The royals thought it a grand idea for Harry and Meghan to fall on their swords? Perhaps the negative tabloid headlines diverted attention from the criminal acts of Prince Andrew? Didn't Andrew appear on television to air his dirty and illegal laundry to save his reputation? Why are Meghan and Harry not allowed similar opportunities?  How does the royal family square the actions of Charles, Camilla, and Prince Andrew (Jeffrey Epstein) as being on par with Harry and Meghan, therefore, business as usual?
Not racist???????????????????? - go back and watch the wedding. That bunch of UK people looked so uncomfortable it was ridiculous. I was uncomfortable watching them. They need to get up to date. It's 2021 - HELLO
My grandparents are not racist.  Did you hear gran and gramps, it is said on world wide television, so dont take me out of your will !!!!
Of course they are not racist they are superior to EVERYONE inclusivly.  Asking what her unborn child would look like was just a way of implying there would be something wrong with a child by her.  Americans are so obsessed with "racism" they can't see how rude it is to treat a pregnant woman like that of any colour?  She was far from home isolated from her friends and hormonal and vulnerable and someone wanted to pick on her.
Meghan has been laying out a base for a long time for a profitable divorce and exit. She learned from the best. Harry , this poor clueless man has fallen victim to the Black Widow. I predicted this quit a while back. It's coming
MM knew exactly what she was getting into. She's an attention seeker. Until she married Harry, she didn't talk about being biracial or being the target of racism. They did the interview to run down the Brits. She'll take Harry for everything sooner or later. I'm not a fan of the monarchy and I'm an American. But pretending this is anything other a 'poor me' stunt is ridiculous.
When you ask if he is racist and he responds in that accent it just hits different
Prince Harry : "We'Ve BeEn ThRoUgH HeLL tOgEtHeR"   Viewers: 👁👄👁
Before someone came to the Royal family it never been an issue and the outsider who is bitter and ungrateful trying to destroy the royal family.
I don't believe black women
Meghan making sure she cashes in on royalty with the two babies now
he should have said nothing.
0:13 Gosh! Sweet Prince William! 💕
Lol they got evicted from the castle.. fraud royalty
‘My family? The one built on colonialism? racist? Nah’
That’s exactly what a racist family would say....
@0:10 *Where did this random Black lady come from and with a Motherland design at that?*
I like how he has a black person in every shot..ha! What a joke.. just another photo opportunity to make it look like you actually hang out with black people when you don't that's pretty sad
#GODSAVEDUTCHESSMEGHANANDPRINCEARCHIEFROMRACISTROYALS!!!       AMEN.
I've always liked Prince Harry
They are not racist. Imagine how many races are citizens of England now acknowledged them as Britons. We are not British, we are Asians but we admire the monarchy. This meghan markles BIG MOUTH, JEALOUSY AND EVIL PLAN after knowing that she could not be a real princess and a queen to be she always opted to the mirror of THE WITCH. Why do the journalists always make interview with these two  stupid people are they blind and deaf of what they have done similarly to their own family. Let these be known. IN THESE LATTER DAYS THE GOOD WILL DO MORE GOOD AND THE BAD WILL DO MORE EVIL. JUDGEMENT DAY IS NIGH ITS NEARLY AT THE DOOR ! ! ! !
Explains alot happnd to lady Diana....
Why are people so shocked about the Royal’s racist allegations? Europe invented the hate, bigotry, prejudice that’s alive in this country today. Look what they did when they came over here. They tried to wipe-out the original owners of this country and enslaved others to work the land, while sitting on their asses like Royalty. The descendants of Europeans are the very same people in the United States, that wear’s hoods and red caps and stormed the capitol. There’s only one reason they hate Meghan and that’s the color of her skin.
Of course, they are racists. What are they talking sh*t about.
My beloved Harry and Meghan, be of good courage and don't be afraid. Jesus loves you very very much. He is your Rock, your Strength, your Shield, your Refuge, your Defense, and Protection. You have an army of angels surrounding you. Don't  be afraid!  Stand still, be at peace. Put your trust in God, and let Him fight your battles for you. God knows how to fight wars for those who cry out to Him.   "No weapon formed against you shall prosper, And every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their righteousness is from Me,” Says the LORD," ( Isaiah 54:17).     " The LORD is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall. Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident. One thing I ask from the LORD, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the LORD..." (Psalms 27 :1-4).
I have been pregnant before in my life and l never had questions of how dark or light my baby would be, when babies are born and everyone comes to see them that's when comments come that oh the baby is light like the father or oh they took their father s skin tone or vise versa discussing it while someone is pregnant ND even implying darkness because one parent belongs to a different race it's Rasist finish and clary, now my question to the royal fammily how dark are our minerals have you ever thought of that, that you already contaminated either way
Well yeah they are the first biracial marriage in the royal family
what about the four people that said they were bullied by megan, we dom't here anything about that
This is not the correct answer. Yes they are saddened from the outcome and the Royal Family will look into this.
Apparently the Duke of Edinburgh told Harry before he married Meghan "One 'steps out' with actresses, one doesn't marry them". And we all know what happened the last time a senior royal married an American divorcee - Edward viii in 1936!!
I believe him.
Notice megan dont speak up until harry get cut off fund from palace
*C L I C K B A I T **#CLICKBAIT*
Oprah: You were marrying a 1200 yr old institition, you're marrying the monarchy, what did you think it was going to be like?  Meghan: Well, I didn't do any research on it. I had no idea. 😳  LIE! No one can be this clueless about the royal family and what their tradition involves 😑 Me-gain married for all the wrong reasons.
The Oprah interview was a preamble for a BOOK DEAL people. Me-gain and Hairy want yo mooney $$$ 🤑🤑 'Free' interview = pure PR America's new Moneyarchy - queen Oprah and Me-gain The Princess ..
Sooooo royal family is racist .....wats new in it.....thy colonize n slaved millions.....come on megan u want to be in limelight tell something new ....
Meghan is like Serena just another drama queen  big time
This been going on the kilt Dianna and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't kill the most beautifully one of the royal family in that plain and let's not forget how the other wife over came everything they hit her with
This harry guy is learning to be a victim. Financially cut? Lmao u left it u dumbass. Its like i dont want to be identified to this family,i only want them to finance me
Someone here is saying that queen Elizabeth is Queen of South Africa. Please don't believe this person. They dumb. Queen Elizabeth II is also the Sovereign of 15 countries in the Commonwealth of Nations: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.  Not South Africa. Correct me if I'm wrong
I don't buy that for a second.
This is utter  immaturity!!!  Royal family  should  have shown the royalty by discussing   family  matters indoors, this looks like a blame game and an excuse to leave the royal family .No regards  and respect being a prince
These content creators that just repeats what allegedly has been said without generating real new content is very irritating. The headlines are misleading.
They are rasist Harry and Meghan won't lie about this I believe them
Ok. He said it. They are not racists.  What a load of royal crap😂
Meghan is a grifter, a passive-aggressive manipulator
$8M for this garbage? Sick!
Oh, the poor Royals!!!  Diana would be doing actions around Yemen. War is great there and every minute a baby dies of starvation.
I'm sure they were ALL very much aware on the treatment of Megan since she wasn't a royal but a commoner and a mixed race. She never had a chance....
A very good actress
Its funny but very sad how this  situation reminds me of Macbeth by Shakespeare where Macbeth for YEARS already struggled with learning to be grateful for where he is in his life, having very close friendship with the king, and being a very powerful and well- respected man himself in the kingdom. one day These 3 witches appeared and poisoned His mind to think that something is wrong with his life as a Scottish general, the 3 witches used his sadness of wanting to be king to their advantage. Macbeth listen to them  and was EXTREMELY convinced. Later on in the story he killed the king and stole the position of becoming king, and THEN he killed his best friend when he felt threaten by his friend’s  “ questions” of how he became king. At the end of the play Macbeth was killed by his OWN PEOPLE, the 3 witches failed to tell him that while They help him kills and burn bridges with people he thinks is a threat to him and his happiness, they will also help him die a brutal death in the end. All Macbeth needed to do was be grateful for what he had and who he is,  and this would have NEVER HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! This connects to Megan and Harry because Megan was the “ 3 witches” in the story and Harry was “ Macbeth” in REAL LIFE.  Harry also already struggled to find contentment and gratefulness about being a prince in the royal family. When Meghan came into his life she caused him to believe that something was wrong with his life, and used his sadness to Desire to be independent from his family to her advantage.  He listen and watched her, and he is convinced.  Later on Harry kills his family in the form of heartache with his rebellious actions, and start to slowly but forceful become “ independent” and THEN he attacks the public and rejects his former friend’s advice and warning  when he felt threaten by the  his friend’s and the public’s “questions” on who is influencing him, besides himself. In the end of 3 1/2  years Harry Lost great respect from MANY of his OWN PEOPLE  that respected him very much. Meghan( 3 witches) failed to tell Harry that  while she helps him  create heartache and burn bridges with people= relationships he thinks is a threat to him and his happiness, she will also help him lose respect and relationships from people that TRULY MATTERED!!!.                               THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT!
? Meghan never said those "how dark will the skin be" comments came from a Family member. She said it was basically powers that be in the institution. She even made a point to differentiate them.
Meghan is out to divide and finish the monarch. Remember she is an actress.
Every family had their issues... but that doesn't mean I will go in public and media to scandal the secret for royal family just to get an intention.. but if harry had a problem with father and grandmother what's had to do with Willem.. they are brothers and nothing in the world deserve to destroy the brotherhood relation to any women.. in this way harry lost his brother love forever that's really break my heart
Very smart 😂 they put a black woman walking on their side so they won’t say they are racist
Prince HARRY -> Fils indigne -> fais beaucoup de tort à sa famille. Un homme, un vrai ne doit pas laisser sa femme salir sa famille.
Well done YRH ! Thankfully  you are a mentally composed,  descent and honest man. The Monarchy is in good hands
She should have stayed inside the family and worked from with in to fight whoever is illtreating her. She is too immature.
They went and took over lands and colonised them, taking what they wanted and leaving lots of countries poverty-strickened most of these countries have coloured people. They are racists and have always been that way.
when you join the Royal Family, you change to THEIR character. they don't change to yours. the Royal Family traces its history back to King David's Throne in ancient Israel. she just pulled a Prince from it. "Here Adam, eat the apple." - Eve
No they're not racists, because who leaves their Ivory Towers to see the color of the minions they have bled  dry for almost 2 Millennials; not one Anglo-Saxon to Windsor Royal has cared about how they gained a throne, nor conquested blood wealth. Meghan is only Black when convenient-how nice it has to be living her life as a Million dollar Royal victim-so over her fake tears 2021.
Mrs and Mr Meghan Markle. Harry is being led by the nose. What a weak simp he is. Well done to the starlet; she's turned Harry against his own flesh and blood. She's climbed to the top and is now busy destroying the family that pulled her up to the top out of the anonymity where she belongs. When your family has a toxic addition, conflict inevitably follows.
we all get an opinion. what strikes me most is how powerful meg is. she is cold as ice. cunning and calculating. look at her eyes and facial expressions. she is a actress. even if she is telling the truth she is hard to believe because we can tell she's acting. this is a very powerful self centered individual who is doing more harm than good to her families. second in line do not get their child called prince. ever. to say this is racist is nonsense, and just playing the race card for sympathy is what it is. oprah feeds her and him leading questions which didn't help the kids be able to answer in a fair way. didn't look good on any of them. pretty low class all in all. the queen has more class in her little toe than beggin' meghan has in her little black heart. harharhar. have fun
“ We are very much not a racist family.” “We stay away from all peasants.”
Hogwash
nope you are 100% racist but of course you are going to deny it
Black people are racists with themselves. The whole world knows that. The fact is she wasn’t born to be a princess, she doesn’t look like a princess,  she is fucking boring, she is an activist and she is a fucking Hollywood actress nothing but that.
are we ignore the fact that how British crown had enslaved the blacks and the Indians (asians) for centuries just cause of our colours?
How can these royals wear such stupid masks?
William is a class act. Just like his mum, just like his Grandmother. God save the queen.🇬🇧
I watched a little of the interview with Oprah and Harry and Megan and Oprah really made him look stupid! She wanted to know how a prince living his type of life could be trapped and he said he didn’t know he was trapped until Megan came along and explained it to him! Huh? What? Oprah almost couldn’t keep a straight face and she tried too. lol
I’d be more worried about it being ginger
Yeah we are racist bro . Thanks for asking . Lmfao . Stupid so called journalist .
"We are not a racist family" is exactly what a racist family member would say lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
An not only that they agreed to raise archy .the Queen &family.
Megan is a bad influence to Harry .
I don't believe the allegations tbh
It's all a tempest in a teapot.They'll kiss and make up.
They are aging like spoiled milk
If I was william I get the jet an fly to were they are an get harry an archy back to england.than let it happen
They are not a racist family.  That is NOT what Harry and Meghan are alleging. There was one member who was concerned about the skin color.  No one should be surprised who that was: I bet it was Princess Michael of Kent.  She has a history of bigotry and snobbism. In re the need of support: no doubt Meghan is 100% right on.  The "firm" is too concerned about appearances to have allowed her go see someone. The British royal family are desperately afraid of the media.  They are prisoners of this fear. Without skillfully managing the media, support for the monarchy could collapse. Again, Harry and Meghan are right about this.
Kath better run when wards are said between them two.its war now
Megan is white lmao. Those people are white folk playing racism card on each other
Kate going to run to day an grandmom when them too go at it.willliam an harry.william will face him head on.i guess army dident teach harry anything at all.neather did England
Harry needs to go to a breast with archy an stay their for a week an pray
I am surprised harry agreed with meganx.she trying to shame I he whole family of harry's it sad real sad
🔥🔥🔥
She Doesn’t wanna do volunteer work Megan she wants to be Hollywood this job that they do the Royals is a lot of giving and volunteering she wants to be Hollywood can’t you see who the people are just around with Look where she lives just saying
I don’t Believe Megan I believe Kate William
Very Sad for them!
As long as they are masked they will remain irrelevant. Abolish the monarchy.
I believe Megan did tell a few lies,like not knowing who they are but I don't think she lying about them being racist knowing their history
Diana found help for her mental health issues outside the palace, Prince Harry, did the same. Couldn't he guide his wife to do  that  or did they use this as an excuse to leave the royal family and pursue a hollywood life style with multimillion deals.Of course , in order to manage this, they went on to defame HIS family,via their interview. Pathetic man, who confuses his wife with his mother, a problem he might pay dearly, in the near future. As for his wife, she will never take Diana's place but she will find a place among the american elite, something she could never achieve without his status. If she thrives and leave him behind, she will not  care to look behind for him.
We all know prince diana had a hard time as well
There’s nothing meghan can do to look classier than kate middleton who can only speak highly of the royals. I’m sure kate may have had a few shares of experience, royals are people too they aren’t perfect but kate middleton will always focus on being grateful. She didn’t react when she was told she can’t have the title of a princess nor a queen, she’s ok with that as long as she’s married to the man of her life. kate and william has true love while meghan markle is self-absorbed. Kate middleton gracefully accepts every royal duty that’s been william’s world she loves william, she doesn’t care about being given the title or not, she’s still grateful enough
Yikes. People saying they are not racist makes me uncomfortable. Non-racist people never had people question their potential racism. Duh
My condolences to Harry....
#Team Cambridge #Team William.
Oh Dear, god help us.... people commenting have the IQ of a plant. You don’t know these people personally except from what’s broadcasted! Please reflect on how pathetic you sound when you talk about them as if they were your friends. They are not, what you read/watched  in TV /Mass Media is what they want you to see. If you guys suffer from developmental issues you shouldn’t be making pathetic comments.
The royals are a racist family, they and the British bankers financed the transatlantic slave trade and these are facts!!!
There's been drama in the palace since 1936
White people are in denial
I don't want oppression or whatsoever, but before you even get into something, esp the Royal family, aren't you really not aware that there will be major restrictions?! I am a simple human-being, but I know the heck of responsibilities and lots of do's and dont's when I marry a prince. I mean, common. I have a picture. You guys because of your connections have more than a picture. You marry someone that you know bound to so many rules, then when you're inside you'll whine and complain? You chose that girl. Whatever it is, the institution or the firm. You are all the more fuelling fights and misunderstandings amongst family members who have been long broken because of Diana's death.  You should have helped them heal and unite as a family, moreso, it is an already confused state because of Brexit. They live off the tax payers money, so ofcourse, parting ways would mean cutting off allowances. What would the people feel if after you leave your Royal responsibilities, you expect your father to shout it out loud that he's 100% for it and would still financially support you? Isn't that unfair for your family, knowing that they would be scrutinized financially for supporting someone who left his royal duties?  You don't want a lot of press like Diana, but you got the most prominent press in town to interview you. You girl created an even bigger issue about the royals than what happened to Diana, yet you don't want the press to sensationalize your life. I don't get it. I think this is why most royals would want to marry fellow royals because they understand the language. No need to waste time on this circus. Not against common people, but this is what happens.  Seriously more on go girl power? Where is the logic? You are the one who attract things, get into things then show total resistance inside,  shout out loud girl power!   Think girl. This is the real power. Think first before you get into something. It has been the firm and the family long before you appeared in the picture, and you want everyone to adjust for you.   When someone uses the word girl power all the time... when you create more chaos inside a family that has been broken for a long time instead of helping them unite amidst all the other issues surrounding them  is not bringing light but division. While it is common to have family misunderstandings, wow common be interviewed by Winfrey like showbiz personalities?  Too sad for the queen and William.   It's like taking more than what you can chew then complain about why it's a bigger bite. Why the hell you chose to bite bigger in the first place. Duh?  You are not a hypocrite to not want the fame and the title that goes along with marrying a prince for sure, but you want it all, at the expense of all the family members. I wonder why Kate has carried on silently  like a real queen. Love for Kate.
It was expected... Till date intercaste love marraiges are not accepted in Indian households... No matter what caste you are, upper lower according to their criteria whatever, if you are not from their own they won't accept 'mostly.'. This is the case of common Indian Household. Imagine that's an ancient royal family, they brought a biracial divorcee according to them, when they thought about her being a biracial divorcee that moment itself in their minds racism started.   I knew it was coming and something like this would happen.  I don't know how much of everyone's statement is true. Only thing I feel in all this chaos is, Meghan should be careful. Remember how princess Diana was scrutinized after her open interview about Prince Charles cheating and how royal household wanted her to be blind eyed about it.  Paparazzi constant scrutiny. She died in car crash. Everything seemed like planned.
William carrying out his duties... Harkle carrying out a smear fest. 👎🏿
Meghan responds yes the Royal Family is racist because Oprah told me they have white privilege therefore they are racist. Here in the US my Black privilege trumps all White privilege.
THE ROYAL FAMILY IS POINTLESS AND IRRELEVANT -- WHY IS THIS NEWS?!
Megan doesn't know anything about the traditions of the royal family and titles (Harry could tell) and all she could say is it's all about the color of the skin.  And they, apparently, expected to lead an idle life, without bearing any responsibility, as long as they were sponsored for nothing.
YOU MEAN THE SAME FAMILY THAT MADE THE BULK OF THEIR WEALTH OFF OF SLAVERY AND COLONIZING THE PLANET?!?! OK LOL
She was.talked about racism  and playing victim , smart acting!!!
Meghan forgot where she came.from!!!! On her wedding  just one family member.' Who hold her hand and walker her????
All fake and contrived stories. Just to push racism,  make people distrust and hate each other
Those two idiots are true Democrats. They live on other people's money,  but complain. If you disagree with them (God forbid), they call you  "racist".
And how do you know you are not racist. Is so easy to say I am not racist when you don’t even know the full extent of racism. Your welcome.
To the bunch of idiots in the comment section: This is not a Meghan and Harry vs his family. These are a few of the challenges that were faced, and with the media being so toxic, is it any wonder why? And is it any surprise that a member of the family might be racist? Depends on how important the snob feels, because we all know who would've said it.   They're a family, and nothing is going to split them. I do love how it's always failed to be mentioned that Meghan said that the queen and her husband have always been good to her.
2 millionaires complaining to a billionaire how hard it is to be a royal & how they have ONLY the 15 million his mum left him ...DURING A PANDEMIC that has left many jobless & homeless. Shameful & disgusting how them & the media are treating this as news.
Creates a lot of distraction away from Prince Andrews relations with Epstein.
Oprah might have staged the interview .
I give him a lot of credit.
Meghan is just jealous cuz she will never be  Queen ;)
It's the affected party that would complain, and if one cannot understand what is happening around them they cannot solve the problem! Wake up and read the letters on the wall!
What about prince Andrew and Jeff Epstein? Cover that story.
What a load of bullshit. Prince William didn’t “hit back“ he was just walking past. You media are like vultures who need your own lives instead of commenting on other people‘s.
Meghan stipulated on her social media profile she is Caucasian, and complains that the RF are racist? When she toured Africa she referred to herself as 'a sister' meaning she is black by heart. This woman is  actually one enormous joke!!
Been through hell together... really? Oh do tell!! 🍿
Harry is a spoiled child.  And now that he's off daddy's "payroll".  Meghan is calling the royals "racist" because they made a statement about the color of the child's skin and that she has no support system from them.  Plus, no security?  Also, when her son was born no "Royal" title.  Didn't Harry and his grandmother and the father explain to Meghan the workings and the dynamics of the Royal family???  There is something definitely not adding up properly, and you don't need to be an accountant to figure it out!  Harry only gave brief answers to Oprah's questions meanwhile, Meghan was the one who spoke 99.99% of the time.  The scales are unbalanced!  Sounds like she's got a "gripe" about not being treated differently from the rest because of the color of her skin.  Oh! C'mon.  Recently, she has been given support for using her "racist" trump card to place blame on the Royals.  She knew ahead of time while dating him that life wasn't going to be one big fairytale.  The Royal family works for the citizen's of England!  It's a difficult and complicated life they lead and it's not for everyone!  For example, when Grace Kelly married the Prince of Monaco she gave up her acting career and stayed in Monaco with her husband and accepted the new way of life.  Sounds to me that Meghan Markle still wants her "Hollyweird" lifestyle and is using Harry and the family to get it her way.
She just wants attention to her! Boring.....
If hispanic people are racist, ..(almost all hispanic person have a mixed culture), what we have to expect about thr royal family like them..hellooooo???
Kate I love you ❤️😘💕 meghan🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Kate I love you 💕❤️ meghan🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Lmao of course they are
Queen Elizabeth can not be racist. I don't believe it.
I'm brown, and I think Princess Meghan is stretching a dot to be a line. It's not about being black or white or brown or yellow or whatever.
Willam is a gentleman ; how professional he addressed the reporter !
When are we goimg to change the subject? You are all busy now to prove that Meghan is a liar....and so WHAT?
I wonder how this marrage will end for the breakaways. I suppose it's all about holly-jollywood, with a puppet on a string.
ONE SIDED STORY.
I think Megan is petrified of the royal family and that's why she wanted out. She's just not comfortable with them. After all they are from different worlds. Harry should have known better what kind of wife is suitable for the palace life.
Harry was fine till he met Megan. Ye he had a bad boy party side to him. But him and his brother were kind and caring. Diana wud be so proud of her son's. Non of them are racist ffs
Come on people ur not pleased ur brother married a part black woman uall just don't want to show it BUT REMINDER MEGHAN WASENT THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN THE ROYAL FAMILY SEARCH HISTORY KATE NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING SHE IS A WOMAN JUST LIKE MEGHAN I DON'T CARE ABOUT COLOR.
Yeahhhh 🙏🙏🙏 god I love Harry and Meghan ❤️❤️❤️ finally someone had the bulls to get out of those horror
The Cabal push misdirection on it's people and so many just follow along in step...do a little research  https://www.bitchute.com/video/kHHFp5320B0J/ sit back and relax with an open minded review... anyone wonder why Oprah is sporting an ankle bracelet... just asking.
what did he answer? i didn’t hear it.
Why didn't Meghan speak to the Royal Physician about her mental health? Never has any of them ever divulged info unless directed to for public information.
I could be wrong but Prince William and Prince Harry seem like they have different Fathers they look alike somewhat but just a little different
omg !!! she is 40 years old, she is divorced, she has acted in series with sexy scenes, she has rejected her family apart from her mother, how can she not be grateful  to marry a young prince in a powerful empire?  she is considerably enriched, she has contacts of the nobility, of showbiz thanks to harry and the Queen .. above all, she has a loving husband who has leave everything for her, his family, his prestige and who supports her tottally ..  what is she looking for? she has everything !!  she has an incredible chance to express tolerance at a high level and promote anti-racism associations and leagues. no, she prefers to denigrate those who have elevated her to the rank of duchess! she thought she deserved more? What kind of heart she has to not let her own father meet archi and Harry ??  Even if she said some truth , she dont have to forget the great chance to be accepted on the monarchy despite her past  and origine ..
These fake ass kings queens dukes duchess and they live on stolen money from Africa and the that fake queen is not the Bloodline of Judah nor Egypt
It’s challenging because she wasn’t raised royal! It’s impossible to understand that lifestyle if you weren’t brought up that way. I knew this would be a huge disaster for the royal family. I want to further understand the race issue here because what Harry and Megan said in the interview they later clarified. So media and OWN producers edited to make it seem worse? I want the full god Damon story.
William is a good man. Meghan Markle is garbage
Prince Andrew is racist! Can we dwell on this ****
When Meghan was still scheming to get into the Royal Family they interviewed her friends, remember her friends and people who had known her for years saying how Meghan had only ever been for Meghan. She was always only about herself she uses, manipulates and bullies people, mistreats and abuses those she believes are 'lower' than her be they black or white (!!). Suprised Oprah fell for Meghan's terrible acting though, lost respect for her now. Poor brainwashed, lapdog Harry :'(
Meghan is more of a lady than Camilla will ever be!
Team Queen 🇬🇧 No Surrender. 🌈  Peculiar isn't it the Queen who's reigned for 70 years and had 13 prime ministers, multiple different heads of state, other royal families and dignitaries and retains good to cordial relations with all suddenly has a problem with a minor television "star" who is on a second marriage, sorry third marriage,  doesn't speak with her father and other siblings, has had numerous fall outs with friends and peers and shows all the traits of being a sociopath, complains of having difficulties with the royal family. Tough call to decide who the problem is here... 🇬🇧  Firstly was she that naive that she did not know the protocol within the royal family. Also do you Believe she had to learn everything herself. Talk about being the victim.   Next ask yourself why did Meghan invite Oprah Winfrey to her wedding when she hardly knew her. Funny how they both. Live in Santa Barbara.   Poor Harry getting cut off by his father and relying on the 10 million mothers inheritance. The fact that when there are royals who are not in succession as others won’t get the title Archie won’t but as William gets to be king he will. Surely had the parents still been in post the parents security would be the children’s security.   Finally Meghan was careful with her words but she defiantly played the race card without any full explanation which leaves anyone to accuse any in the royal family.  She described herself as having thoughts of taking her life not suicidal. But saying there was no support when she has money to pay for treatment or counselling. Even a B lister could afford the daily visit to a psychiatric professional.   My view this is all calculating just look at her history.  Reckon she wanted to cash in and have the cake and eat it. But it’s either be a royal or complete freedom and not both.
"Some recollections may vary" means Meghan is full of crap.
I don't believe a word from megan markle. The royal family is right to stay silence. Megan was suicidal? Well she is rolling in dollars now. She knew y she pulled d race card!! Kate is a lady till d end. I don't buy anything megan says.
Bring down the racist Queen!!!!
I see lies sell well! Especially in American  fake show culture. Keep your lies on your continent! As of Harry, go find a job and earn your own money instead of expecting money from the family you rejected and lie about. Family matters no matter how bad should be discussed in the family. Instead Megan decided to cash in on these lies.
Well maybe not you but people lie so can you...I dont believe them at all..
Prince William îs such a True English Gentleman! He reminds me of His mum's respect and politeness towards media workers!
Stop leave Megan and her family alone
Duchess Kate looks good in a ponytail
Mr not me,  Meghan CANNOT pass as white,i can see the drops in her all over,and I could probably see the drops in you.!!! Do not get it twisted!!! It is what it is Black ppl have been mixed for centuries,stemming from slavery,and the white master,some kids Today you can't EVEN tell they are mixed or have one white parent..It is NOTHING NEW,AND PPL OF TODAY THAT HAVE A WHITE PARENT ,AND ONE BLACK PARENT,THEY really do not look any different from a second and third generation mix black person who descends from the mix..
And are on different paths facially by the looks of things. William is as bald as my granddad's car tyres and Harry still has his hair
Where was Harry while Meghan was telling "her truths" why wasn't harry sitting beside her saying "well darling I've explained all this to you, you know why Archie won't be getting the prince title? oh, darling you know it wasn't a wedding three days before the actual wedding, oh darling we wouldn't have been able to have thirteen lavish holidays if they had taken your passport from you" just where was Harry?
Welcome to real world, this is where most of us get discriminated, treated badly, judged wrongly, etc. We try our best to deal with this shit everyday. Some are able to survive through, some give up. You are out of "royal" family. What do you expect ppl to do for you? Treat you like a 2nd royal family? Or something? What's the point of this interview and explaining what you've been through.  Live like a normal person and face the cruelty of this world. There are ppl out there working ass off, getting no recognition, no respect. And here they come with "mental health".
I feel for William, Kate and the Royal family. It is very easy to accuse someone of being racist, but it is a lot more difficult to prove you are not. People who want and desperately need attention will often tell lies or half truths to instigate drama. They can't live without drama. (Even when they say they want privacy ... ). Best is not to react to them, like in the saying "Don't wrestle with a pig, because the pig likes it and you will get dirty.". But if the whole world is pulled into the drama by the dramaqueens (in this case by giving this world wide sold billian dollar interview) then ... whatever the targeted people (Royal Family in this case) say or don't say will be used by the dramaqueens and their followers to stirr up more drama. A drama with lots of sequels. Meghan and Harry have given a lot of junk food to the tabloid press to chew on for a long time.  What Meghan an Harry did is pretty low. Extremely low. It shows there is not a lot of intelligence or wisdom present there ... .  But since not Everybody is blindly following their victimgame, it may backfire very hard. To the point they get suicidal again. And who's going to be blamed for that then ?  Meanwhile the so called 'racists' have to deal with all the accusations and go on with their life, jobs, responsibilities.
Stop the cap
It is sad for POC that Meghan was the one that could’ve changed things. She had the opportunity of a lifetime to stand up for POC and to show just how wonderful they are. Instead, sadly, we got a woman who has absolutely no loyalty when it comes to family, someone who wants to be seen as a victim and run when the going gets tough claiming the race card. She should have been a better representative for POC and Americans!  She should’ve shown class and taken her own classes to learn how to act when in front of royalty, hell, the public for that matter. She is in her 40’s for God’s sake and she didn’t set up a class for herself?  Instead she’s going to cry nobody taught me?  One of her first times to represent she comes out of the church, all eyes on the new girlfriend that the queen actually changed things just for her allowing her to attend things Kate had to wait for until they were married. So what does Meghan do?  She comes out of the church and sticks her tongue out at the crowd!!  It’s all about her and if it isn’t, OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!  Harry could have married better!  POC were counting on her and she is trash!
Million-dollar crybabies..
Ok if ur family's didn't racist how's talking about color about dark skin.
If the royal family were truly racist they would not have allowed Harry to marry Meghan (who I had no idea was black when she first came on the scene) and she would not have had such a beautiful wedding with almost the entire country cheering her on. I think it's a disgrace that Harry had to paint his entire family as racist. He trashed his own family on TV. That was unnecessary and looked suspiciously vindictive to me. Revenge is never the answer. Meghan is now happy she lives in LA back to her Hollywood life and that all of America now love and know who she is. She got what she wanted. FYI I am not British or American or from the Commonwealth.
So glad Megan and Harry left, this royalty is very shady starting from how Princes Diana passed away and not to forget Andrew epstein relations!
I thought Harry and Megan want some P R I V A C Y that's why they left the Palace. But here they are exposing the dirt of their/William's Family. Needing the media's attention again. And here's Megan worried and hurt that her son won't get any title. So P R I V A C Y and P E A C E FU L L I F E    it is they really wanted.
I think Kate said it
Is prince Harry a racist.?  The whole family is being accused of such, does that include him/ or gets a past for marrying a biracial woman?
The very idea of a 'royal' family is racist. There is nothing royal about them. They are evil.
Imma be honest, I don't understand a single thing thats happening but my god its getting heated af over in the UK!
You can see the exact second when Oprah craps her pants.
By all accounts his great-grandmother was!
Meghan Markle is a bad actress and  Liar! Trouble maker 🤣embarrassment for the royal family!
We are very much not a racist family. And we are very much not amused.
Isn’t he the one who cheated on Kate?
People that have saying Megan is lieing . Nobody wasn't in their shoes.Remember how they treated Princess Diana .So people stop being bias and hypocrite.So ,because the Queen and his family have money.Alot of people with money does behaviour so hostile. Honestly.
She has never dated or married a man of colour yet has the audacity to call US racist??
The way the Royals treated Diana, did Meghan actually thought she was going to get treated better?  They are making it into a race issue it’s what the commies like Meghan do best.
William is just jealous harry has hair!🤣
How can the royals be racist and spend so much money on Harry and Meghan's wedding? Life with contentment is great gain.  William is not racist,  so is his family.
Harry u married a wrong women... y suddenly after black lives matter thing this women is being interviewed and she is speaking now...now uk is being targeted
Prince Harry says he lives off his mother's money and he's complaining about not receiving money from his father?? For God's sake! He's a 36-year-old-man! He should earn and support his own family himself!
I wonder if the firm will use the Queen's biracial great grandmother Charlotte as an excuse.
Thank you for your time and insight! 👍👍👏👏 Well i will also say this here, the fact that covid 19 has been a bit though for us all there is still much advantages when it comes to investing and trading bitcoin and making profitable trades. Bitcoin is currently my most favorite asset and i completely love the technology behind it, so far its been so much profitable for me despite the asset has been unstable for sometime now but the good thing is that its been able to find a good support at 40,000 region against the US dollars.   If said thing is to happen, it will be very unwise for you not to know how to Increase your Bitcoin instead of Just Hodlin. I got this tips first hand from  Leon Joseph.  He is always one step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Leon it was more easier to understand, Here are his details on Tel- gr>m  ( @leon_joseph_fx) for his assistance on strictly crypto related concerns.
Click bait picture
Meghan markle is a lying narcissistic person!! Look at her own relationship with her father and step siblings !! Now she went and destroyed Harry’s close relationship with William !! Meghan never wanted to play second fiddle to Kate that’s why she created this rift !!! She can never be Queen so she spat the dummy !!!! Of course she knows the palace will never publically speak about private matters that’s why she gets away with all her lies !!!!  Harry has lost his marbles totally manipulated by Meghan !!!
You know the person in your Facebook feed that is airing their dirty laundry, don't you judge them? I judge them hard. That's how I see these two privileged whiny rich kids. This is like jumping on FB to make sure everyone knows your side of the story and to try to make the other person look as bad as possible.  Honestly, Harry is worst than her, because he knows the expectations.  He also knows the royal family can't just fire back at him.  He is sitting here crying about being cut off financially after leaving the Royal family. He didn't want to do any of the work, but wanted to keep receiving funds. Dude you are in your 30s, get a job!  I think he is a jealous little brat. To throw his family under the bus like that, especially when his grandfather is near death, what audacity.  I don't think I would ever forgive him if I were William. It's like he is a child upset that he isn't going to be on the thrown, so he is trying to keep his brother from being able to.  You know she said several times she didn't hear the person wondering about her future children's skin tone. I almost wonder if Harry made that up.
Well, what else is he supposed to say? Lol
This meghun is devil she creates lies to get sympathy and attention using the racism card she is liar and prince wiliam is not obliged to explain or apologize for athing he didnt do or behave i m from middle east support him and his wife against that selfish woman
Portraying like Diana, but Meghan could be another Camilla in the family‼️
Of course you are... Sir.....Does  he even know what racism means?
I always knew Markle was going to be trouble
Only white family... Enough said!!!
Do you know what she was paid $7 million to do that an interview what was her second of all this country is in a crisis we got people flooding our borders and we’re worried about her feelings being hurt really strives to push the race card but I don’t see it and then she goes to Oprah who’s the most racist person I have ever met talking against white people that is racism to case anybody hasn’t caught that racism goes to Waze
Her father and sister were right about her that Meghan is not as innocent as she seems ... She is ruining the lives of others .... The respectable wife does not speak badly about her husband’s family after leaving ... she has an inferiority feeling no one has nothing to do with , She is the most ungrateful person in the world .. she is street girl destroyed a prince's life
Brazil Monarquia Parlamentarista !
They should thank Meghan for taking the heat from Prince Andrew!
So sad who ever  is right  or wrong FAMILY  should  be  Forever
Oh, so British royal family who colonized millions and treated them like shit because of their skin colour being racist is a shock to the world??? Shocking!
THEY RAN FOR THERE LIFE FROM THIS CULT. Call it for what it is people stop trying to sugar coted. This girls smart for running away from that whole "Institution " seriously ppl that whole families existence is to been a prop for there country There whole life is that of slaves controlled and 0 actual Freedom. Not feeling sorry for anyone but this should be changed. Seriously no more monarchy
William and Kate have a lovely family and I’m absolutely disgusted with Meghan Markle. You could see this all happening from the very beginning. Disgusting human.
Yea,ok they are on differents paths but they should never had stop talking to each other. This is what happends when people get married n allow they wifes to  change things n rules, feelings, etc, around. When about to married put the cards on the table, n say this is the way it is take it or live it. I said it for experience,  I have 2 sons, we were very close knit they hot married  n they're wifes change everything the way we were. I do not know my son's anymore. I really feel for Harry , the  way  things have started  theyre future is very  rocky.  But one thing tough, they should not lie about things just to get  back at them.
Racism is not a feeling or an opinion but well-refined construct on which this entire monarchy was built
72 UK lawmakers acknowledged all the crap meghan got from media. And royal family did NOTHING to protect them  https://youtu.be/9Cc1RW4VK_o
For god sake just live your lives and stop poking problems out . That interview was not a wise thing to do . Royal family are not racist FULL STOP
I am sure you are.
THANKS GOD MEGHAN AND THE PRINCE HARRY RUN AWAY FROM THE GOLDEN CAGE. 😊 OTHERWISE, MEGHAN WOULD HAVE ENDED UP LIKE HER LATE MOTHER-IN-LAW, LADY DI... DEAD/KILLED IN A TUNNEL... WITHOUT WITNESSES... BECAUSE SHE DID NOT FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE “GOLDEN CAGE FIRM”… WHAT A NICE “ROYAL” FAMILY…☹
Look at the maths...patterns .... Megan has a thread of destruction... inconsistencies here....you work it out? PS I’m not a Royalist per se but am in the Commonwealth .
Megan Markle has a photo in the Buckingham Palace when she was in her teens and in Oprah's show she says that she didn't know who was Harry's Prince?? 😂 come on, she is a great actress! but at the same time she wasn't at all!! She couldn't be bigger as she wants acting, but she knew what she wants: Being a princess and married with a prince but she didn't want any kind of responsibilities, that's why she took him away from his family, country and  his world, she still manipulates him until trying to convince him to destroy his own family in Oprah's show. So why she didn't go to Ellen's show? I think she  is very narcissist,  arrogant, and resentful. We cannot forget how she fired employees from the palace who were working there for over 20 years. I don't think people don't like her because of her skin color, I think is because her arrogance. Even her Dad would be agreed with me!! She wants to destroy even Kate's image and reputation, and I don't think Kate will said anything at all because she will be the future queen of UK so she knows how to reacts in this situation.  Megan is a poor resentful! I don't like that gold digger of Megan! A great manipulator!! She destroy the brotherhood between Harry and William!!!
I want Oprah to interview CHARLES 😏
The way most american reacted, like meghan a true warrior for not following the monarchy protocols and have a say about the rules and regulations..like...british people and their royals are not even care.
Now don’t go find a innocence black person for a photo opt. It make your family look guilty!!!
Leave Prince William out of the Meghan brew.  Meghan is a jealous witch and envies Kate.
Apparently leaving the Royal family has caused them to miss the elitist protection he was used to and the attention from the media he was used to. Now they live here in the USA. Great.....Would you nice British folks mind explaining what these two people ever did for the world that they think their opinions and comments are important. Seriously, I just don’t get it. So, they have tiny little complaints about situations and comments from years ago. Wow...Get a job and support your family or sthu and thank your family for supporting you.
They clearly not stated if it was the institution of the member of the family.
Oh common Megan go to Africa if you feel  black women  and find there a bantu black man  to husbund   ,not a white man with  blue blood, you become a rich women with this  wedding  and now   say that you feel black??   But it was good when everybody was talk about you  that o maaaayyy  good an other  princes and all magazins  was talk about you..You become a stupid celeb with this interview!! I dont like you sorry  👎👎👎you are not a good wife  in yor husband just an agitator
William : We are not a racist family, but we got our wealth from slavery. 😎
Imagine going on social media and shaming your own family... I mean that kinda... maybe have a family meeting and solve out each other issue??
Was it his dad are brother made that remark about her baby.
Always got the African-American as a photo prop no other time have you seen the African-American women walking with him and his wife no other time what a waste
Their raciest you know it's true everyone can see it
I don't understand you cnn who defiles the British king and accuses racism!  At the same time, there is no American where black would take his family white or Asian and Latino!  you don't because afro doesn't tolerate them, because of their races and their colors.  it is a completely eye-catching publication of how the British royal is insulted, shamed and accused of racism, while blacks attack every race.  show a million Afro families living in the white, asian and latino races.
Millions of people around the world are now enlightened. 😆 One evidence is the YouTube video that is circulating now with millions of views and thousands of supportive comments for H&M. The title of the video is We Proved Royal Experts Lied About Harry & Meghan. BOOM! Never will read nor believe British Press anymore (except a few that are neutral or no bashing or character assassination type of articles).
I’m a foreigner who’s living in Britain for over 20 years. Brits are naturally nice people they are no racist I don’t know what Megan is on about? As our children grown up already they have they’re own job now, we all work hard and live a very very very happy and quiet life in the U.K. Of course you do get to meet assholes every now and then but that’s a water under the bridge, it will be the same wherever you go if not, they could be even worst!
If the Grandmother and Grandfather didn't say it, what does it matter? Sounds like a family issue not one for the public. Leave these matters to the dining table.
I like that pink, Kate has on.
Until they name someone I assume she’s lying....
Ur wife has made u weak
Couple of the year!!!! Not them two, but Megan, and Harry. Racism in Europe and Britain I'm sure it goes way back. It's time to set the record straight. God bless yahhs new family.
Will and Kate shine by themselves. Mr Markle and Wallis 102 are and always will be a pathetic shadow.
Washing dirty linen in public so unroyal 😏  BTW Every family has their share of problems but who goes on TV and proclaims them! Sad
The world  need to make a law to media tv and radio 📻  Internet shit. Or else  this  will bring disaster and distracce.
Why  are they  bothered  about baby 👶  colour doesn't  matter 🤔 that's  a racism  thought. We all know  that white man with mix race woman will make a white golden baby 👶 so why  think sort negative thought. Hope you all understand  now.
He look just as his dad
The comments are laughable. As if you all know these people personally. At the end of the day, what it comes down to is they are a family, just like any other with their disputes and skeletons in the cupboard. The fact that they are royalty is beside the point here : the interview is in very bad taste, if it were done by the next door neighbours no one would be interested. The so-called racist comment, which the Queen herself has said will be investigated, was probably some stupid gaffe, Meghan didn't even hear it, her husband told her about, (which just goes to show how much he gas-lighted his own wife !)  Discretion seems to be highly underrated these days....
Well they just admitted that they were the ones to ask about the baby color when they said their not racist. Megan and old boy said they would never share who had that conversation.
in the philippines.. prince harry has been "nagayuma" by meghan.. bewitched
It’s normal in UK. Any half Anglo-Saxon , called half-cut!
Charades
If Prince William's mother died along side a Muslim Arab, then how could her kids whom she loved and raised right, be racists?  The same monarchy that has every color of every race as their citizens,  The same royal family that welcomed the opportunistic witch into their family, how can they be racist, explain?  Don't be fooled by the girl who cried wolf.
William 🤡🤡🤡
Meghan a home wrecker
I don't believe megan is a black woman I beg to differ....I'm not blind skin almost as pale as mine-signed elizabeth
Harry hids behind his wannabe white wife.  Wm needs to live his life and enjoy his wife & children and Harry should do the same.  I will tell them as well as you that according to the Bible " A lie will not stand".
A modern, educated person or family is one which can anticipate the  issues that a new family member of mixed race could potentially face, talk and behave sensitively and stand steadfastly behind her every step of the way. And that's precisely why the institution has proved that they r obsolete and incapable of progress or refinement. A wasted opportunity indeed.
Well said Prince William
Have this couple heard of “genetics”, “Mendel’s law”?  I don’t think there’s any racism about the question of skin color.   No matter what color, the baby will be beautiful in its own right.   He would still be loved.  So, what’s the big deal?
Harry change after  he met Meghan .He looked unhappy ang she  looked  in control  over him  , poor Harry.
I love Kate and Wills. Meghan proves once again how trashy she is. She is no Princess Diana and never will be.
What he's saying is that he doesn't think their behaviour was racist. I think few racists actually believe their behaviour is. They are just entitled people conditioned, ill informed or ignorant about the potentially harmful impact their behaviour can have on others. That's why we call it structural. It is ingrained. It has become a way of life
🌺This video is done the day after the Harry & Meghan interview to underhandedly portray a passive message: 🌺“Hey look world... we’re in East London inner City where a lot of blacks live....we’re not racist!” “Look I’m walking & talking with a black teacher”😳  🌺Ask William & Kate what is the Monarch doing for the education system & pay rate for teachers & poor conditions of the schools in this area??...in East, South or West London while Kate&William kids goes to private school.  🌺Don’t just “USE” the school for “PROPS” in front of the Media to score points in a Royal Family Dilemma!!
WATCHING #MhelsWorld
I think it was Camila...
They are lying , Meghan is not victim ! Look at their interview , Meghan hold Harry hand ,she made him do that ,she controlled  Harry. What 's a shame !
You are not a racist family? Joke of the millenia
There are not a racists family. I very much believe that they are not.
Why are your fingers so tight? Harry was sad but very at ease with himself in the interview with Oprah. You have not treated your brother well, very simple, you didn't realize he had grown up. ', he that is down need fear no fall.
Oprah, you're gonna look like a fool girl! Has it dawn on you to ask how come Meghan took so many trips abroad without her passport. You three made it sound like she was a hostage! You ppl were on a stupid mission! Appalling, vicious and out of touch!
Here comes the damage control....🙄
I only trust people that own their racism. We all got it and we all have to work on it.
William and Harry are sons of Diana. Does anyone really think that William is racist? I think MM convinced Harry that the whole UK was racist because how would he know different? Out of any 1st world country the UK is not one I would ever call racist. Facts are that the staff have been coming out before this and some have even been in therapy due to MM being wretched to them. She even went so far as throwing hot tea on a server. We can't get Katherine's side can we. MM was banking on that when it came to the making her cry thing. Funny thinking of MM searching Buckingham Palace for her confiscated passport and lisence. 🙄 She managed to make it to Serena's tennis match where her actions were anything but ladylike while talking (flirting) with Serena's husband...as I see it. Infact she jetted around quite a bit. What a bunch of absolute b.s. Her and Harry contradicted themselves over and over. There are pictures of MM with a prince Harry doll years before she met him. She was all about the BRF so there's another lie to chalk up. Do the research. This one is a bad to the bone.
I would wonder too cause dark beautiful skin is much preferred to than pastel white....it may have been intended to be a huge compliment......CALM DOWN PEOPLE!! God made us all a beautiful garden of such wonderful variety....do we complain or won’t eat an orange because it’s not red like an apple???? NO we ENJOY BOTH!!!!!
A couple goes to Oprah to whinge, the other one goes to a kids school to represent their institution and the connection with the people. 🤔 hard choice
So, who wants to ask them... what happens on those tours to Africa are they just a show with no real changes to wages, housing, education, how are folks in the Common Wealth really doing ? AND doesn't the history of the Monarch comes to mind at all
What would oprah know about the royals or monarchy or European traditions... stick to your tribal background
Megan cant stand the fact that she is the not liked one...booohooo
Kings and Queens, Prince and Princess, your highness........ Bahahahaha  Screw England
Now they going to be hanging with color people everywhere and shows the respect they don’t show Megan and his son
Now they going to be hang with color people every where they go soon going to have dinner with them too just to show the respect they haven’t with Megan at the moment hypocrites
Meghan just an attention seeker, she loves spotlight 🙄
How is it that White males are always saying that Black people aren't feeling racism when racist treatment is documented by many? It seems that White men are the defenders and deniers of the century. Racism in everybody's face - yet they deny it.
I guess harry is not lying.
There's a picture of Wallis Simpson that has the same hair duo & clothing as MM.
.MM is a very bad actress.  Wm & Harry are on different paths and that's good.
Markle and Harry are disgusting
Meghan thought she is a "princess" until she met the real princesses.  That woman is a narcissist
Wow! So Meghan wants public sympathy because she revealed  about " skin color" etc... she plays a victim, obviously.. and the way she says she doesn't have any idea how it is if she become a family member... they are not ordinary people.. girl!  Wake up!  I can only guess two things.. it's either you are dumb or you're playing dumb. And Prince Harry, what happened to you, you never brief her! I was surprised with the interview about curtsy....
What an inappropriate question William doesn't deserve that he is a class act that was really disgusting
People worry about a title during a pandemic.  🙄. I’m sure the family love the kids and probably don’t want anything to do with the parents, they’re too much drama.
Is it just me who noticed that William is suddenly seen with a black lady?!! 😂
It becouse ur family rich but one day u beung die without nothing...be humble ang happy life not a plastic drama as always
Terrible putting him on the spot for a shady thing his brother said
have they forgotten how Phillip treated the black king....disgusting.....and what about William saying Harry should not Megan they demonstrate their racism almost every time they are will people who are not of the "upper class" Did you watch their faces during the wedding when the black minister was talking?    give me a break William and Kate are part of the machine and they benefit from the news each time.
I don't like that Kate Middleton. I think she's jealous of Meghan.
Asking a member of the royal family, “is the royal family a racist family ?” ... What kind of stupidity is that ? Royal stupidity?
America wake up and ignore this pathetic family. They are cashing in while people are dying and struggling all over the world.  A millionaire that wanted financial independence complaining that his Dad cut off his allowance?
Diania was murder plan
Didn't meghan blame her unaccomplished hollywood career to her race as well? I saw that interview and it's on wikipedia I Can name many successful mixed race and african american actresses in hollywood though :) I guess meghan just had to use the race card coz she knows it sells
So called Prince has delegitimized his own brothers experience and his familial circumstances. Harry clearly expressed the hostile, racial outlook that is at the core of a warped, old English decision. A primal outlook and basis for who gets to be, so called, “Royalty” in England.  Euro-Nobility, in more advanced monarchs, is and has been about humility, love and Christian traits that shine and honor God.  Not some eugenic, behind closed doors proclamations of what COLOR a child comes out of the womb. The nobles actually await the exit in momentous decision making? “White” as a coding system, like LatinX to “White” as a standard even in the USA! Coding and categorizing of such is a potential for a diseased system.
I am so sick of hearing about all these damn royale people why don’t Harry and Megan go back over there I love British culture but in recent years no Poor poor old prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth
Me gain is evil
The Queen agreed to the marriage so why would there be questions about the child or children?
It may not be you Prince william, but there may be some members or a member of your family who is/are racist.
Harry looks so miserable
Entertaining to read the comments.  Amazing how Markle first caused dissension in her family, then Harry’s Royal family, Social media, UK and America, broadcasters, etc. Save your energy and keep your positivity, the monarchy will live on!! The Queen can fix this, give her time.
They are... they are!!!!!!
I don't believe the family is racism at all because the accepted the relationship, they got married and they knew that kids will come out of their love. Their must have been a conversation where someone did broth up the color of the future baby skin. They just got married and now they announce they are having a baby. The public and the media bullied Meghan just a few months into the royal family, whom ever talk about the skin tone might have concern of how the public would us that against the newly couple that have been going through hell with the media and their privacy. We all are human and in certain conversation we must understood what was trying to be said and having so much negative impact already I believe that it was the last straw for Harry even if it was coming from a good place. Harry should a prepare Meghan better than how he did for example he taught her last minute how to greet his grandmother. Coming into a high profile family that carries along historical monument for their country and the commonwelt you need to prepare anyone you are really considering to marry. Not just prepare them as you go forward cause it is alot to take in. I have not seeing the full interview and I would love to. But everyone as apart to play and their should not be finger pointing. Serious family matter should be resolve amongst family and not doing it publicly. But if you have an awareness that affect you and you want to shed light on it go for it. If you want to clear miss consumption about you go for it. But don't bring your personal matter out like that.
Prince William ❤
Am sure going public with all of this is going to be great for her mental health.  If they wanted to get away they stayed away and build that family life they wanted showing their issues at this points seems more like a way to stay relevant so is hard to take them seriously. If anything is sad.he won't consider the damage their comments will make against his grandmother she maybe a queen but am sure she deserves better than her house being brought down by her grandson's family.
With regard to the brooch incident - because people thought it was racist they didn’t look into the history of Blackamoors - “Moors”.   They were kings and aristocracy and Artisans the brooch depicts a Moorish Venetian prince and indeed revered in literature. Like Othello. This is frustrating as whilst slavery is an crucial part of understanding history it is never highlighted that we were and are Aristocracy, Artisans and skilled scholars. In Italy the cult of St. Maurice was widespread. He was a black Roman commander who originally came from Egypt and became a martyr. He was depicted in art as a very distinuished black man, and the Venetians were also influenced by this.  That’s history I would love everyone to know. Others quickly co-opting and using the term racism are cleverly hiding our history as no-one researchers further ☕️ 💕
“ Hitting Back “ ?  Guess you’ve never seen a Tyson fight . 😏
Walking and playing with people with colored skin is so different with how you deal with them!
The propaganda war begins..
The royal Family  is not  racist. The  one  who is  RACIST here  is  Oprah. Everyone  knows  she is one of the  biggest  racist in the  US and  she  promotes racism. Don't  believe  just  listen to that  interview. She orchestrated this  whole  interview  around racism.
One Word:  LIAR!!!  What do you call treating her like trash all these years!  Disgusting!
If they are not racist y didn't they protect them all along? They took everything away from them. Even tried to take away their freedom of speech. Y didn't they come forward all along and say something. Smh. I wouldn't even trust them with a dam dog
Why didn't they talk about it back in England instead of doing dirty laundry with Oprah
Child abuse in Brits Royal Family... Worst man
Prince William & Duchess Kate gracious & a class act .
Megan is like a pineapple Pizza.
Harry should be ashamed to bring this stress onto his grandmother
Megan is like serving Cabbage at an Italian Restaurant.
Not poking fun but its funny thier walking with a black person
It’s NOT the family it’s the institution!
GIVE THEM TITLE HARRY AND MEGHAN DRAMA QUEEN AND DRAMA PRINCE
Harry-get a real job; Megan-SHUT UP!
royals want to break free.
If they were racist the wedding wouldn't haven taken place ( 32 mil £ was the cost). What about the expensive jewelry she received from the royal family, a big budget for her expensive designer clothes, bags and shoes, the trips abroad. Did you see her recycle any of them? Not to mention that they both received a beatiful home. They didn't pay for anything while living in the UK. What else do you want? You are both grown-ups... work for your money...You can't expect your family to pay for you when you are 36 years old!!!  It's not your fathers or grandmothers duty to provide for you, your wife and child... IT'S YOURS!!! Get a fucking job! Provide for your wife and child, be a MAN!!! You don't want to be a part of the royal family, but you want the titles, the benefits that come with the titles, money... and what do you do?? the answer is nothing!! you just leave the country and trash your family that made you who you are! At the beggining you left because of the media, now is not the media it's racisism. For somebody who didn't want to be in the media, you and Megan Markle sure went a long way to have media attention. It's all just crap! I don't believe a word!
I just want to say, I think it's a good thing that they're out of the royal family. I mean who would want a feeble minded, victim seeking minded and cry baby queen as a sovereign? It was a test, she and he failed epic time. It was almost good to see a first generation mixed race royal family in my lifetime, but I was not meant to be, cuz she selfish and stupid!
I stands for The queen and the Cambridge fams
Why did Kate make Meghan cry? Is she jealous of Meghan???
Race card, women’s card, children card...it’s too much for me. Family matters!
MEGHAN IS THE RACIST!  She estranged herself from ALL her white relatives.  Prior to her lavish wedding, she was aware that her offspring could NOT be in line for throne due her prior marriage, NOT HER RACE.  Entitled BULLY!  The interview was about positioning themselves for $$$.  ** SHAME on OPRAH's drama over UNSUBSTANTIATED accusations.
Yup, just like Bill Clinton didn't have sexual relations with a certain woman.
Media have a nerve to ask those questions.  They know what he is going to say. Totally sc.. b... the paparazzi are.
Harriett the Poodle, arrogant and so jealous of his gorgeous brother Prince William who will be the future King.  Travelys is under investigation and the sick pair knows too well end of March major changes will be announced.
Good of Prince Wiiliam to comment back.
Harry made the right decision!!
Love Kate’s coat !
The entire Foundation  of the monarchy  is buit on isms mostly racism. They built their wealth and power on the foundation of  those that are darker are nothing or less then. The monarchy is an antiquated idea and just a standing symbol of being stuck in the past.  They also no longer have the power  they used to. As for people saying they should  not be speaking  out. They have every right to publicly  tell their side  of the story. The media has spend over a year  lying  about them and making them out to be the bad guys and the family  has done nothing  to correct it.
You know it is true when "do not complain, do not explain" is now being ignored by the Duke of Cambridges himself. 😂 He should've been a brother and stood up for his sister-in-law being abused by British press and none of this should have happened if he did.🤷
This is why u need to be aware of the women you marries, she can came in your life and destroy your family, the man will always fight for his family, Harry is ready to step down , from the royal title for her, but never in your life u will see her or any women step down on something that she appreciate, it can be a job,promotion, any, women are not got people
I think Will is ashamed of what he said to Harry and he noticed everybody allready guessed it was him who made the comments, this is why he's ignoring the Reporters and not making Eyecontact.  The futur King is a racist. Wow 🤯
The Royal family bloodline can never be broken. It's not about racism.
Meaghan is home where she belongs. She and Harry can raise their children the way they want. All the people in the Royal family may not be racist but the ‘ firm’ and the British tabloids most certainly are.
Harry and Megan have the right to feel hurt etc. But was it necessary to go on national TV and tell everyone what was going on? They couldn't take care of this matter in private?. I guess you do whatever it takes to heal old wounds.
meghan said in the interview, it’s not about the family, but the institution. they’re probably not racist, but the lack of support against the racist media was troubling
how about markle taking a polygraph test,and as for harry he is a disgrace
I believe everything Meghan Markle says - NOT!!!
Princess Diana demonstrated to the world that she was a loving, noble peaceful, caring woman and gave birth to 2 hansom loving boys, hopefully Meghan is not going to tear their relationship apart.
If the royal family has receipts, I'm hoping they let them go under the table and let tabloids publish them. Harry let Meghan cut ties with all his family as she did herself with hers, she's clearly the problem.
The first question was "who's the daddy" 😁
Lady Diana would be ashamed of  Willam
“Family ugliness must not be aired” is one of China’s most familiar  sayings, reflecting a code of silence that demands: don’t talk about bad  things happening at home. 😂
i don't buy it
I think most people wonder what a baby will look like, white, olive skinned, brown or features etc.
I cant believe that they aired their family biz for all to see. Dirty, disrespectful and 100% shows the content of their characters
Megan Markle is a traitor to the throne of England and should be brought up on charges for false claims against the throne. Bring her back in irons!
meghan is a snake
The favored son speaks. And people wonder what he would say????
Here's a question. Presumably Meghan is seeing a professional for treatment now? Correct? If the suicidal thoughts are real? Great.  But what professional would ever let a suicidal patient go before an audience of millions to talk about what they are dealing with? And be interviewed by a non professional, in public?  This does not make any sense.
Not at all shocked by the treatment that the British and the British media give to this. All of us foreigners know that the royal family only reflects its own people.
I mean I don't think anyone thought will and Kate were racist but what was he going to say as the Future King of England no me and my wife and children aren't racist but only some members of my family may perhaps be racists..
Yeah, Sure Didn't You See Their Black Tag Alongside Them...
Harry said he would never share that conversation, but they did,  didn’t they.
They didn’t like it when Meghan father gave interviews yet they did the same to the royals. No different from what her father did. They knew they wanted to cause hurt
prince william is is a liar, he knows very well. who harry, is talking about
I bet the skin color of Archie is William.
God bless William and Kate and their beautiful children.
The queen of England is also the queen of Africa
Everything is unecessary....they decided to leave good!!! Why damage the rest of the family? They just want attention... Mehgan read books related to the life of Lady Di, she knew!!! I am sorry but not buying it!!!!
Time for a change on how the Monarchy progresses.  If the firm is run like a company then they need to have polices in place to address these issues.  Unfortunately it is duty before family.  They said it themselves!
Megan remainds me of my sister in law never wanted to get a job instead turned into a trouble maker.
So sick of racist this racist that I’m becoming racist!
GO GO William!! She’s dying for attention again!! BEST ACTRESS🏆
They really want to be kings and queens and don’t care for Harry
The best is to tell us in our faces that we do not belong to your color oyaaa we should pass
William is happy his brother and wife left. Things went exactly how he intended. Muscled and bully them into fleeing. How sad 😥
Maybe his the one you said those offensive words.If not, why comenting when not even the queen did it
Harry betrayed his family.  Britain is the highest civilization of human rights in the world. No death penalty there. How you could bring racism issue against them? Even Britain open and accept refugees no matter what colour of your skin, hair and your religion.
I don't think anyone seriously believes the royal family is racist.  Look at Harry and Meghan's wedding, for God's sake!  The Queen welcomed all the African Americans with open arms which was wonderful and totally unprecedented.  I also think it sucks that the Queen spent $30 million on Harry and Meghan's wedding and they then trash the royal family to an international audience.  This entire interview stinks of revenge.  They wanted to "step down from royal duties" but keep the privileges that come with that.  Cake and eat it too??
Live and let live. These monarchies  must change over time.
So you think they were  going to admit it 😂😂😂 let  me laugh
Of course they are a racist family 🙄 #History
Something most of us have known already.
That’s not hitting back, he’s in denial. He should pick up the phone and call his brother.
the Queen referred to the  sussex's as harry and megan, and NOT as the Duke and Duches, to me, that speaks  volumes
Harry and Meghan listen to Little Archie " Drive 🚗 safe"....
Oh there we go. They are on a mission to defame Prince William so that they can take the crown. Sad.
That’s what every racist says!
No one cares
Why did I feel like something like this would happen ✋🏻the tea and the fact they chose to move to America I...
🌺Yes! This was “STAGED”!!!...ABSOLUTELY! I’ve NEVER seen a BLACK person with them NEVER!!!... especially in public appearances 😲NEVER! The black woman in this clip is being used as a “PAWN” and a “PROP”. Using this woman is very sick. It’s like saying:”We have black friends” or “we have a black nanny”😳
Remember Harry: the Man who conquers himself' has conquered the 🌎. He will not be bullied' nor bow to anyone or thing. He bows to the creator of the universe' who formed all things, sees all things, believes all things are possible for him & his family. Seek it for wisdom and guidance.
Doesn't everyone have that one relative who you love but is very clearly racist or sexist or whatever? Just because one person in the family is, doesn't mean the whole family is.
I dont believe him
If the royals were racist why did they come and celebrate M and H wedding??? Doesn’t make sense! I wonder how much money M and H got from Oprah interview?
Family drama like every other family.  Seems like Harry is angry with his father and brother over them not being head over heels in love with his wife like he is.  This interview insinuating the family is racist without naming names is reckless.  What was the point?
Harry you are the definition of Royalty. Title's don't define you' your Spirit does!
As for Harry; I'm so proud of you becoming the Man your mom raised you to be. I know your mom is smiling, when she looks down on you and your family! You know she understands what you're going through. She's happy that you have the courage to stand up for ypur wife & family. She's so proud of the Man you've become! You have truly grow up! Its a pleasure to watch you and your family live life on your own terms, though it hard something's. You can do it. I pray for you and family to enjoy life filled with love, peace, healing health and wealth abundantly! Amen
If Diana, Princess of Wales was alive today...seeing them not talking. In my opinion, she would have gave them a very stern conservation. 😞
Haven’t spoken to your brother.... wtf.
Sadly, without any harm intended, all i know is that  i definetly don't  want  to end up as a  gaslighted and confused victim by his wife like harry; who clearly can't think for himself or who can’t even distinguish between what's real or not!.
LOL!!!!! The placement of the black woman (in an african print top... to make sure we see her!) in the winter and then the black boy in the next shot with Kate...try hard much? That's the most pathetic amateur PR move I have seen in a long time. Must be a shortage of good staff due to them being "bullied"out by Meghan? Again so laughable and predictable. It must be so frustrating to Wills, Kate & the rest ,that no matter what they do they get outplayed every single time , while  digging themselves in deeper and deeper. This has been badly handled by the RF on every front, their snobbery, non- inclusiveness and petty jealousy plain to see. If this is how they behave towards their own family, how can they possibly have any place or relevance in todays world and especially in The Commonwealth?
Interesting to have blacks in the photo ops all of a sudden.  This is so sad
querendo mostrar que não são racismo imagina ,essa rainha tem cara de ser uma peste
I think it was William. But we don't know the context.
"I Meghan Markle deeply apologize for forcing myself upon a people whose biology is unique and took hundreds of thousands of years to develop.My acttions were a combination of my own ignorance, selfishness, and the American culture from which I am a product of. In America, we are systematicallly taught that it is necessary to bully people of European ancestry into including other biologies for the purpose of what is the opinion of social advancement and also spite. I have grown to see the errors of my ways and I respect a unique people's wishes to develop their own biology independent of wishing to include people who evolved for hundreds of thousands of years in a completely different environment." Something that non Cau----ns will NEVER realize.
And ofcourse the prince had a african woman next to him.. LMAO
William your mother would not be pleased with this behavior. Nor did she teach you this. I admired you and was happy that you mom taught you to love everyone equally. Don't let other Spirits pull you away from that. Come back to the beauty you were raised with by your mom' and make her smile again.
Harry is a disgrace. How dare he!! What a pathetic excuse of a prince. They should strip his title. He got conned by an actress and ruined his life.
So proud of Prince William, thankfully he will be King. Although his wife and all his family have been covered with insults, speculations, and lies, he is as usual an example of elegance and intelligence.
The  Picture of Meghan Markle from her worlds and her actions: All parents in the world and all relatives ask themselves who the baby is going to look like, even If the parents are both white. All asks themselves If the child will have blue eyes like mother or dark eyes like father, or If the child will have nose like father or like mother, mouth like father or like mother,  and so on...  If the family and the relatives and the nations ask themselves what color of skin the baby will have this is not racial issue but just a natural and human issue.  The Big Problems are with Meghan Markle. MM has serious problems on herself and this interview just confirm that, and not only this but all her life! She is the one who have problems and she put them on the Back of others.  She is the Saint and Eternal Naive, as she proclaimed in the interview,  on her 36 -40 years with many men relations and very experienced woman playing Naive like a Virgin (as Diana - who MM is imitate - really was)  but all around her are guilty!  She is proclaming herself in the interview as eternal " Naive" despite her age and experienced life of wich she said she is proud, without any embarrassment of contradiction!   Even Oprah said that : " Everybody who get married knows that You are marrying the family too and You should have a conversation with yourself and your friends" but she lies that she was "Naive" and not interested altough she was the one who fixed with her girlfriend the First Blind meeting with Prince Harry! Also she said  " she was lucky that she were very experienced woman " and  than said that " she is very Naive" ! This contradictions show She is Demonic : her soul and her mind are posesed as Bible says. She is mental sick because of her Big and Millions Sins unrefined. Everybody has sins but to put your sins on Back of others is demonic!  She is the Eternal Naive Victim!  There must be big problems with her inside and Meghan Markle's conscience, she must pray to God to help her. She really needs help, like all the people have, in fact. God is the only Salvation!  More, the Biblie shows that all people who wants to suicide are posesed by Devils like Iuda was. Only God can save peope in this moments, not other people, because only God can clean their messy life and messy soul because of their past life and MM was an adultery and messy sexual life witch is big Sin for God and that must be paid as Biblie says!  She really needs mercy because she is posesd like Iuda was. She is blind about herself! Everey body is in fault but not her! Everybody: sister, father, her ex men and ex husband, the royal people, the media, etc. She is a Poor Naive Saint!  She is abusing poor Orphan Harry  by playing the Eternal Victim Card! Harry is confusing her with his mother, Diana,  because this is happen with Orphans that why they are easy Victims and that why God directly protect Orphans, as Biblie says !  Harry is mental abbused by Meghan Markel he is terrified and pshycological tortured every day by MM playing Victim Card and he is her puppy because he is terrified his wife not die like his mother Diana. This torture paralyses an Orphan mind and his reactions!  People must Save Harry  from MM by praying because of mental abuse and  terrible and atrocious on him! This is why he accept a 3 years older woman, he needed subconcious a mother,  but She is a  tortious on Harry. He is not aware because he is in her diabolic trap.  She lies that She don t reasearch on internet who was Prince Harry before meeting the Prince but in the same time She said that they met trough a Blind Meeting arrannged by her friend (of course on her command) and also she said to her father " I met a Prince".  She lies too much, Pierce is right that she lies every word, and She is the one who abuse Harry, in mental problems, as he said. She speculate an Orphan's menthal issues. So She get her hand on him!  But Bible says that God will Revange Orphans from those who abuse them !  She says that the wedding was for whole world because of Prince Harry, not for her. But, of course, she felt the most important person and fatal woman because she hunted an Orphan Helpless Prince.   Than imediately she contradict herself pretending that She was Most importantant woman in the world  because "people go crazy for her personal life " saying subversive that She is the Most importat woman in the world . She is sick narcist visible posesed by demons, in all her elementary contradictions, exactly the way Bible says.    In fact She said in other interview that She is the Most trolled woman in the world, and so to amaze subversive that She is Most important woman in the world and fatal woman! No woman is like her! She is not fatal woman as She thinks she is just because She was recruiting a Confused Orphan Prince by diabolically methods!    Not Harry court her like a man does but she clinged him: she is the man in this relation but only with rights not with obligations! In obligations she transform herself,  like that woman of White Snow Story, in Fatal Woman of the World and Prince must be her Valet!  This opinions are made only on her words and actings!  If a woman is happy with her husband she never give such a public interview! And If a man is happy with his wife he never give such a public interview! They are not happy with each other! Time will prove the truth!  Untill now , she is destroying Harry and herself! Only God is Salvation for both of them !
Meghan should have kept that comment about her unborn baby’s skin color to herself. Obviously that was a private conversation between Harry and someone. I would guess William. Families talk about all sorts of things not meant for others’ ears. It’s natural. Some conversations are meant to stay in the family. Meghan did damage by telling the world.
Both trash....Next
I thought William told Harry, not to marry Meghan. I would like to know, "his reason why?  I wonder, did he tell his brother to, "sow his wild oats, but don't marry her?  What's wrong with you people, and that light skin? (you people) are the one's that's guilty, of all that I'm saying".  I've seen all of you suffer and die, the same way, everyone else does, so what's your gift, for being White? Do any of you realize, putting yourself, over your brethren, based on the color of your skin, "isn't pleasing in God sight?  I would wish to be White, but I can't see the gift in it. White privilege. God don't approve of. Thinking that you're better than anyone. God don't approve of. Abuse of any kind. God don't approve of it. Hating someone, because of the way God made them, is hating your brethren, without a cause. God don't approve of that either. That's the same spirit, that killed Jesus. All that's good, gold, and paradise that's given, because of the color of one's skin. God's not for it, but against it. He said; if a man don't work, he don't eat. He was letting us know, "all men has to have a job". Blacks were over worked, under paid, or not paid at all. But the Whites, just only had to be White. They would get the jobs, as well as the assistance they needed first, why? Just being White, is one sick reason. If God don't agree with it, it shouldn't have been done. Look at how long, a portion of God's greatest creation have suffered, because His choice of making some skin dark, wasn't excepted. I really feel sorry for all who or whom profited from this wickedness. Harry can't speak for everyone, only himself. He can say,  "He haven't heard anyone, in my family, speak of any form of discrimination yet.  😎But he can't say, it's definitely isn't  there. If it wasn't there. They would've defended Meghan, from all of that negative headlines, that caused her, to want to commit suicide. Meghan, don't ever give up. Just tie another knot, at the end of that rope, and hold on tighter. In Jesus name sake, Amen!!! There are more that love you, than hate you.
Racism doesn’t exist  Whatsoever! its just trending
Perfect response, future King William.
The queen and the family is full of crap they are racists.
Oprah , you have hit the bottom of the barrel now 🥱you must be really desperate!!!! A very boring interview and full of lies 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 they disgust me and I am not racist but you three surely are 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
This gives me I’m not racist, I have a black staff member and look she’s wearing traditional African attire vibes
We walk next to a black person, we are not racist lol
actress magaling magkunyari, maybe gusto nya makuha ang trono ni hipag , tupperware
And Harry being ridiculous and weak: we want to escape from the awful racist institution, BUT they want the money, the titles, and some privileges.  AND they talk about climate change, environment, travelling in a private Jet.
Wow! Master Manipulator Meghan, with Oprah's help, made the world revolve around her. She had to play the race card to do it. Wonder what she has planned for her Second Act in this fake drama. How long in before Meghan burns Oprah? She has burned so many bridges already in her social climb.  The royal drama is always entertaining.
Like they are going to admit that they are racists.. 🤮 Going to coloured people’s countries and touching kids.. all for the camera! I am sure William is as bad as his dad. Although he has everything, he was very jealous of his brother’s popularity. Just like Charles used to be jealous of Princess Diana!
Meghan berself has never dated or seen around a Black Man.
Meghan is a narcissist. If she really cared about her new family, she would resolve the problem then and there are wouldn't resort to communicating via media. She's a home-wrecker. She's privileged. She's playing  the race card. Let's be honest, we all felt that something like this would happen.
Prince William is in denial about racism in the Royal Family.  The whole family needs to get educated on what racism is.
Its behind closed doors u hear the little whisper,about black people and the royal family is no different.
You are either racist or not...that color of skin comment, straight racist, no way around it. That's like telling a black or brown person that your race comment was not meant to offend, BS
My grandmother- in- law said that I am such a nice person but a little dark. It is the truth so what is so bad about it. Please ! all these are excuses to cause problems. Sometimes I tell my hubby his skin is like paper so white. Is there something wrong with this statement ? Am I a racist when it is the truth. When you can't accept the truth then stop living. Time to depart from this world.
Meghan and Harry are completely telling the truth.  They had to get away from a toxic family.
Someone discussed to Harry about the color of Archie's skin and of course William will denied racism, he should speak for himself because he know there are royals that are racist, you think he' s going to say " yes" we are racist .. Whether the UK want to deny "some" or all the royals as being racist are in denial and naive.  The word racist doesn't sound good and no one like to address being a racist and hide behind the truth.   Walking with a black woman doesn't mean a person isn't racist.  A racist person cannot hide being racist, what's in your heart will come out of your mouth.   They all need to heal from this and all could gave been avoided if they embrace Meghan from the get go, and address concerns.  Harry had problems with William while dating Meghan.  Whomever said it to Harry  know whom they are.  At least Harry and Meghan did not reveal whom it was and that alone is integrity and it hurt Harry could see it on his face.    One thing black people can identify a racist, they lived through it.hat you will reap what you sow for sure.
William respond  what the hell. someone ask William how it feel to be a uncle  William said I am a uncle already. . Katie is a snake.  Kate is the one that make Meghan cry. Kate let Meghan take  the beat down  never said a word.   God be  the glory.🙏🙏
Lol they have a little black child in the shot.  Wonder how hard it was to find him?
I dont agree that the White are racist because there are black that are racist too
He wants to call his family rasict when his son's name is Master archie... Slap in the face huh
I think karma is hitting back
The Royal family had been racist for centuries.  It is ridiculous to think that this is a single incident.  William- your Family and Country's "History" ... in Europe and Africa...begs to differ.  England and its Royal Family have desecrated Africa and Blacks for centuries!
Not about the color of skin, but only about the content of character.
What are they going to say yes we are,what did they do when the princess Michael of Kent showed up with that evil pin to her chest,that was the time to stand up and be counted. Am sure they all had a big smile on their faces
Harry.. Buyer beware. She dropped her dad in a phone call, took down your whole crew in an interview....
Why don't they look like brothers though? It's always been strange to me.
these people live in the 7th century - there is no earthly king - more nonsense by this type living off other people money
I think the movie “LION KING” is real!!! Scar is mean. Keep George away from danger.
Harry is a disgrace to his family.  I know it's harsh,  but don't turn your back on your family.  And yes,  he has a new family now but shaming his own family in public is not necessary.  Is being right so important?
The British Royals have always been racist.  When Prince Philip complains that there is too many humans on the planet, we all know too well that what he really means is : "there is too much "colored people".  Remember the British Eugenics Society.  They represent the exact opposite of our dear Canadians values.  It is about time we proud Canadians stop kissing those Royal B**T and become a Proud, Sovereign, Independent, Prosperous Nation.
can you just let me know if the royal family is a racist family sir?  what a smart question.. what answer did the reporter expect!!
Both Charles and William decided to have black people around them for their outings 😆 🤣 😂.  Totally PR to maintain the image. I believe Harry and Meghan 100%.
What a big surprise!!!!!
If there is anyone racist it's Harty
WELL LETS HOPE IT DONT COME OUT WHO HARRY REAL DADDY IS PMSL
I'm with the royal family 100 % thay have nothing to be ashamed of not like Harry and meg
'They' instructed 'the one who said it' to put out the statement the royal family isn't racist.
William and Kate should not respond to this divisive drama.
Should’ve been handled in private. She chose to leave the monarchy before trying to know them better, putting the Queen in another situation. The worlds in turmoil, She could be doing much more good if stayed with the firm.  Its not all about blk & wh. What I see she’s using as awareness. As well as works on ppl sympathy. How Trudeau manipulates. I liked them both in beginning. What a wonderful opportunity they both had if kept titles. Instead of this  Selfish! Why should canada pay for there security?  They have plenty of money. They left to warmer Calif. When found out Canada isn’t.
Everything and everyone is racist.
@be yourself yes it was PRincess Michael of Kent.there is video of her wearing the racist broach this is the first time she had met meghan..
Didn't a family member wear a blackamoor brooch... Yeah, that's normal, she wasn't a child, she was a full blown adult...
He did say they are gonna speak very soon we shall see !
I wouldn’t call the royal family racist, but I do believe they are ignorant as are most White people of goodwill. I have three biracial grandkids, several biracial cousins, and several White family members. They have often spoken of how they have had these aw-haw moments realizing just how different it is navigating this world as a Black person. And my biracial cousins talk about the “in betweenness “ of being biracial. I am not sure how it is with biracial people like Mexican/Italian for instance. But, we are ALL the same on the inside. God did not create one color to have dominion over another color skin. That’s OUR sin.
👏🏼👏🏼❤️!!
HALF BROTHER.
LONDON BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN , MY 'FAIR' LADY
Lmao where was this energy to speak to the media when all Those horrible accusations against Meghan and Harry... 🤷🏽‍♀️ huh... these people literally are the forefathers of racism this institution brought slavery and racist ideologies all over the globe and were all acting brand new ?!? Hahaha of course this family is racist they’re built on racism ...
Family drama is hard enough not to speak of a public feud...
Hmm the babys mother is mixed race father ginger equals pail red headed child to me 3/4 white 1/4 afro american and boys take after their grandfathers whi are both white it was a racist comment some real ignorant ish
Just because the family is not racist does not mean that there is not an individual in the family who is racist. Also, sometimes people say racist things without even realizing that they are saying them until someone points it out to them. I do not think the overall family is racist but I do believe it is possible that someone in the family could be or could have said things that could come across as racist.
HE HASN'T PHONE HIS BROTHER YET ??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A BROTHER!
I believe him if anyone is racist it will be Harry with his evident dark past
I believe him i truly do.....God bless you all
Correct. The Queen welcomed the egotistic divorcee Meeghone before she got married ,the royals welcomed her yogotistic mom to the royal family and you say Meeghone that the royals are racist?get a grip of reality .it’s normal for people to ask how an unborn child will look like coming from a mixed raced.if Asian will the child be brown or yellow or otherwise black or white.if the unborn child will have blue or brown eyes ?will the unborn child look like a member of the family ? Duh be real Meeghone .there are more important issues than tour own .the whole royal family welcomed you into their own and you have to adapt and make a Positive impact and go for more positive growth.now that you’re a half baked royal prove to them that you deserve to be a part of the royal family and not destroy the two brothers .is it because of the money ? Well money will run out but family will always be there through thick and thin .your name has already been muddled because the public which you use to enhance your bank account is more realistic to more relevant and important issues like putting food on the table and getting a decent job and not marrying a rich boy whom to have domesticated to your own like a Puppet.
Just remind people of Princess Michael of Kent wearing a racist brooch to lunch with Meghan Markle the first time they met in 2017. The palace sent out a statement to stop the rumor Kate getting Baby Botox, Double Standard: for them that was more important than dirty news about Meghan the tabloids attacked her?
Nice Photo OP!
