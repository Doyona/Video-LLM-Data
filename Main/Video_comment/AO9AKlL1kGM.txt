I’ve enjoyed watching your videos, I decided being on the road got too difficult with the balance of work and life so managed to convert to aircraft refuelling. I still get my fix of driving Artics as we are bowser refuelling but it’s nice to see a company not take the mick out of there employees and overworking them. Thanks for your hard work Tim.
Really do enjoy what you do !  Never change haha
Hi tim love your videos

You’re too happy , try spending a week tramping and you’ll not be as cheerful

Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Why do you take your boots off when you get in the cab
Been watching the tiktoks for ages and only just found the YouTube and I’m loving it! Question though. When you say boots off in the lorry are you actually driving in socks or you got shoes you wear in the lorry? Can’t think about driving in just socks 😂
Nice one mate I should video my trucking journeys lol
really entertaining tim
Hi Tim I find your trucking blogs really good and it makes me realise but you truckers really do deserve the money you get
Ive just got a new truck with all the london buzzers and cameras, the buzzer doesnt shut up, youll love it :) Keep it up, cant wait for the next one!
Can you show us how you mount your sat nav down there without the windscreen sucker. Just started the vlog and interested in this
Enjoyed. Thanks
Well done Tim, should be sleeping for an early start, but got hooked on your videos. Keep up the good work, even if it's in a hook loader.
I would love to be a truck driver as I love driving. What’s the best way to become one? Also my partner doesn’t like it as it’s “dangerous”
Applied for my provisional HGV today, I've been a bus driver for the last 7 years but I'm gonna go in a new direction, think I might have a head start with my PCV license driving large vehicles, loving the vids 😁
Only just found your channel Tim, great content mate, not a trucker myself but loving the videos. Keep up the great work 😃
Great video I love your TikTok’s, I’d love to see more angles of the lorry and maybe a green screen like the isle of the man trucker does, I think would look great keep up the great work 👍
"{Indeed, Allah disdains not to set forth an example - that of somewhat [like] a gnat or what is above it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the disobedient, (26) Who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers. (27) How could you disbelieve in Allah when you were dead and He brought you to life; then He causes you to die, then He brings you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned. (28) [Surah: 2 - Al-Baqarah - Verses: 26-28] And within this verse lies the sign of torment through the war of the minutest soldiers of Allaah in order to manifest the global caliph of Allaah Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani Perhaps one of the questioners would like to say: "O Nasser Mohammed, we understood that Allaah guides with it many thereby, but what is the secret that Allaah intends in His Word: { He misleads many thereby}? Then, Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to the questioners and say: These are the arrogant ones who if they see the way of right guidance they do not adopt it as way, so they have acted arrogantly towards the Caller to Allaah and His caliph after the way of guidance to their Lord had been cleared to them and were too proud to take this path. And when they went astray, Allaah left their hearts to stray because of their without-right-pride; thus they will never follow the caller to the truth from their Lord and because of their arrogance Allaah has blinded their insight in line with the Word of Allaah the Exalted { سَأَصْرِفُ عَنْ آيَاتِيَ الَّذِينَ يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَإِن يَرَوْا كُلَّ آيَةٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُوا بِهَا وَإِن يَرَوْا سَبِيلَ الرُّشْدِ لَا يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا وَإِن يَرَوْا سَبِيلَ الْغَيِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُوا عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ ‎﴿١٤٦﴾ }‏  {I will keep distracted from My signs those who behave arrogantly on Earth without any right, and who, even if they see every sign, will not believe in them; they will not take the way of right guidance if they see it but will take the way of error if they see that. This is because they denied Our signs and paid them no heed} 7:146 And this is not because they are astray but they know with knowledge of certainty that Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is the promise of Allaah to raise His caliph on the whole world who is Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, to perfect His light with him (Imam) even to the dismay of wicked ones and I swear by Lord of the earth and heavens that Allaah will perfect His light with His servant however much the guilty might dislike his manifestation Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds Allaah's caliph and servant Al-Mahdi (Arabic: the Guided One); Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani" Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani 02-Sha'ban-1443AH 05-March-2022AD 07:56 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) ________________ 📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement's title): "Urgent: News of a Great Global Calamity" 6 #فيروس_شنغهاي_ذو_عذاب_شديد Lionel Bla

WHAT A JOKE UR LIKE AKID IN A CANDY SHOP😅😂😴
I drive a Scania 770,out of Ireland doing Spain and Portugal. Believe me mate the power is unbelievable.
Watched this with my friend kye proper belta
Did you get your toins
Well done!!
When are you coming to Edinburgh
Great vid as aways Tim. I ll tell you exactly what the door wind noise is,is the top of the door is slightly pulled out from flush. Wait until it rains,water sits ontop the rubber seal,you open the door and get a free shower! I had a 64 plate one,if your brave enough,drop the window. Open the door and deom inside the cab,put your knee against the internal door pull. Grab hold of the top of the door and hold the door against your knee and gently pull the top towards you. Might take a couple of toys,but it should cure the wind noise. Stay safe and keep on truckin'
Another great video Tim keep up the great work 👍
46th haha love ya
20:08 Hook loader Tim
Love the videos Tim, you energy makes them. Keep smashing it 💪
Be careful with blue lights Tim Vosa might not be impressed. The problem is people  get confused with emergency services
