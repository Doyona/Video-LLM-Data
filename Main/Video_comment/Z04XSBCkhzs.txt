Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine 💖
The people who have moved to Florida in the past year and never have experience this, will have a rude awakening! And I bet some of them weren’t thinking or didn’t even plan that hurricanes are a threat to Florida! So you better get ready!
Were are the good ole days when people cared and acted civilized, all the nasty comments were whispered in each other’s ears
Here it is Sept. 24 and We Have Only Seen ONE Hurricane Hit Florida for Next Week and it will Only Be a Catagorie 1 or 2 .  According the The Global Warming People Like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders That we Are Going To See More Powerfull Hurricanes AND More Frequently , if its Sept. 24 With ONLY ONE Hurricane that will Be a Catagorie 1 or 2 , Then WHERE ARE ALL The More Powerfull and Frequent Hurricanes ???  The Opposite is Showing itself to be True... The Global Warming Hoax ,,, is a LIE ... Don't Buy into the BIG LIE  !!!
H.A.A.R.P. Program cooked up storm. Elites mad at Florida Governor.
Most likely it will be a category 5 monster by the time it hits Tampa….
Florida is going to send that storm to marthas vineyard. Dont worry about it.
I better not hear the words CLIMATE CHANGE on these weather channels. It's called Mother Nature!! Period. Stop pushing ridiculous climate change crap!!
trump happy right now
It will be practically  nothing just like 2017  storm..They hype you all up for nothing.
I few days ago i came home from florida it was 20sept And we where on our flight back And they declared the flight due to hurricane so we waited a couple hours In the airplane it was the scariest experience in my life I remember being so nervous in the airplane but after some time we where allowed to fly and yeah
It’s okay I got my parachute ready 🪂 🌪
This hurricane.will reach NYC
The chances of it going where they say it will this far out are NILL.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO DISNEY PARKS 😭😭
Tampa always gets nailed
It’s going across the warm gulf and it’ll down turn to a cat 2? Who does these calculations? Anyways stay safe and prep! This could be nasty!!
For the safety of all undocumented asylum seekers in Florida, it is strongly suggested you seek refuge in a sanctuary city. Hypocrical democrats from around the country are willing to help, as long as its not in they're backyards. Good luck, and Viva La Breakfast Taco.
I already predicted this I told everyone on Instagram “Florida gets flooded don’t look at me you’ll see what’s coming”
this dont show up on my radar
Was in direct path of irma in 2017 never experienced anything like it. If it's not close to that then I don't care too much.
Ga ga goo goo
Cuban mountains will determine how strong it gets… slower = 4 or 5, and faster is a 3.  The weather folks will not tell the multi-millions in FL it may be a 4 or 5 because they are more worried about panic than telling people what they need to hear.
Hello everyone this is for the comment below 👇  as far as boiling water because you couldn't get any. If you're with out power and you don't have a water filter system in your home or a water filter on your sink than you might want to get a adaptable water filter and attach it to your sink.or you can Get a water filter jug and just simply put water from sink into The water filter jug and it will be drinkable just trying to help out have a good day ✌️.
Been thru hurricane since 1960 this one is hype don't waste your money such bullshit
I love a good storm it blows away old things but everyone be safe I've lived in Florida for 24 yrs and been through 2004 and 2005 so this is nothing for Floridians
Red line to Sarasota,  but we have protection from the ancient Indians. 😉
Cat 2 at best..
It's bidens fault that this is coming...FJB...
EVERYONE ALL TOGETHER..'RAIN RAIN GO AWAY..COME BACK ANOTHER DAY'....
Thought i would get through a storm season down here in the Gunshine State without the 24 hour news coverage of you guess it, a storm. But like the 1/6 Show Trial that never ends, this too will gone on well into Nov.
Who cares? Nothing is going to happen!
What about Lakeland in Polk County
Hello everyone if no one couldn't get water because it's all sold out. You can boil your water when you water comes to a boil let it stay boiling for At least 3 to 5 Minutes Than the water will be drinkable. When putting water in to containers please do it safely with caution because the water Will be very hot. This suggestion is mainly for people who live where their water is not safe to drink like in south Florida and other areas stay safe everyone have an amazing wonderful day ✌️ ❤️ 😊 M 🦂.
So it’s pretty much 100% Tampa is what I’m getting from every projection. Storm of the century for Tampa? Cool
This Storm is Karma for Electing DeSantis
I know I shouldn't be complacent, yet it's the same old story. Media pushes a big bad storm, everything gets purchased food, gas, etc.. Storm moves in as a few days of hard rain, and you've just spent a bunch of money you didn't have to.
she reporting from her moms basement?
not to worry, DeSantas will ban the storm and all will be good. Stay safe.
Sea surface temperatures are favorable and wind shear is low, so we could be looking at a Category 4 by landfall. Anyone in Florida please stay safe
We’re screwed
Well I’m dead
I live In boynton. I am most defintrly screwed. i might as well move in at a friend or cousin house. Not gonna suffer again living in a hot house, unsheltered, nonfood. My mom abanonded us when it happen not gonna let that happen again.
I love hurricanes!! Hurricane party woottt!!!
i want cone !😖🍦👈 here!
It’s gonna be a much stronger hurricane than a weak cat 3. I’m thinking a cat 4 or 5 by landfall. The waters are way too warm. It’s gonna blow up and get very strong
Is this going to hit South Carolina to?
Should I worry if I live in Tallahassee? It seems like Tallahassee is on the edge of its path.
it won't surprise me if its a 5 when it hits fla. especially if it barely hits cuba . this sucks
Well is not comming to miamidade  but feel bad for Tampa no one wants a hurricane
Ian? I thought it was Hermine?
I think it’ll be a four. Wind sheer low and sea temperatures is good
That means 3-4 range at impact...not good.
Will Southern Riverview have severe impacts?  I live 15-20 mins from the bay.
Why does it go from a 3 in open waters to a 2?
I took my Saint Cyprian Book of Witchcraft from the shelf to conjure a spell so Ian TS spares the Caribbean and hits Palm Beach Resort like the finger of Satan with its utmost wrath muaaahhh😈🙏😂 Join me, my Witch and Warlock bretheren!!!💪✌️
