"We don't have to actually put it in the movie"   That is the motto this movie lived by
"Sounds like false advertising." "Yeah let's do some of that, that sounds great!"
With such dialed in insight, you shouldn’t write and direct a bunch of movies. 😆
I am still waiting for you to pick me up bro.
Ok, I've literally been waiting here for years, are you showing up or not? I never heard a honk.
What kind of bats you lookin at?
Tronning time anyone?
So I never saw Morbious because of obviously, but they don't actually say that like in the movie "you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" surely not right
Every night before I go to bed, I thank myself for never watching this movie.
I still like this movie more than most.  But that obviously does not mean that I am calling it a good movie.  Still never figured out the black smoke tendril thing though?
Even my 5 years old hated it and got excited for spiderman. He felt betrayed
nors mythology is cannon, egyptian mythology is cannon(?), we got doctor strange and countless other magic-users, their powers are straight up magic, there is no sciatific bulcarp trying to explain it... but an actual, honest to god, folktale vempair is too far for the mcu and we need all of those nomsense with vempair-bats to justify it? what are you scared of?! just commit, you coward!
I heard CocaineBear has a SuperPowered upward turned nose....😅
jared leto need to stay away from super hero movies lol
1:29 😂
What kind of bats have you been looking at?????😂😂😂😂
"That's not what bats are known for, but I'm glad you're excited!"
We said no to this before they made it, we never went to see it and now we hate everything Sony does and are boycoting every product they make. We hate Sony nearly as much as assrael and they are hated world wide for the evil they commit.
I forgot where the "forget" button is located.  Is that okay?
Ryan lied to me  It's been 3 years and he never came to pick me up like he said 😞
0:20 I absolutely love this 😂  And the false advertising bit: "yeah let's do some of that 😄" 😂😂😂😂
Leto is definitely one of the actors in Hollywood right now.
Thots nd praiers 4ore coma girl plz liek. one liek = one Praiers
"What kind of bats you been looking at?"   Furries: B a t *runs away* 😂
Sounds like a bad vampire and superhero movie 😂. The first thing you think about vampires is obviously the super generic internal struggle. So let's make a movie about that, but with superhe..*cough villain in it. From another universe. With a supersuit...and a vampire girlfriend... im out of ideas 😂
I'm still waiting to be picked up...
Who knew making movies with a bunch of Z- list characters was gonna Tank? We all did.😊
You know, like a Bat
could you Please do a WICKED pitch
How dare you. Morbius was the movie ever made!
"... those are synonyms" 😂😂😂
"You wouldnt like me when Im hungry" was said by Ed Norton in his Hulk movie because hes not speaking English and then doubts his word choices. It is my favorite scene in any marvel movie.
First pitch meeting I ever watched.
3:16 "'cause they're both attractive" ehhhhh
I'm Venom! Who?
What turned me off the most about this movie was Matt Smith hamming it up like it was an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
FOUR DAYS WITHOUT A NEW COMMENT?!?!?? 😱😱😱😱
"What kinda bats you been looking at, though?"  Mostly hand-drawn internet bats on some site about there being 30 rules or something like that.
The league of extraordinary gentlemen please
Like a bat 01:14 01:22
Hab für alle Teile irgendwie ein Herz. Aber Valhalla ist auch für mich klar der schlechteste Teil der Reihe
3 am or pm and what year?  I'm still waiting for my ride.🥶
So cow blood was never an option?
The PG-13 rating joke at 1:30 made laugh loudly!
I like to see a pitch meeting for Event Horizon and him having to explain that hell scene
Come on! They couldn’t get Ving Rhames to play Agent Bubbles?! That’s who voiced him in the original movie and basically looked just like him! What the hell?!
I actually think Jared Leto was a good choice for Morbius
Why were there mercenaries in the boat in the first place? Did they really need to go on such a big ship? Doc could just have rented a big yacht, drive it himself or hire one person to drive and they can still do experiments in international waters. In fact, WHY do they even need to go in international waters. They're doing this to avoid the legal ramifications of human experimentation, but since they are not publicly disclosing the events as they are happening they could have easily done the experiment back at the base and claim it was done in international waters afterwards.
I went in theater, slept in the middle of the movie, woke up and the lab scene was going on, slept again woke up in the final fight even that was boring Wtf was this movie
1:27 kinda make sense if the bat hes been seeing is batman though
Was a dick move I thought I was gonna see Tobey Maguire
This is Kirk Langstrom in the alternate DC Universe. Justice League: Gods and Monsters
Spiderman vs. a Vampire would have been cool though.
_It’s morbin’ time!_ - *Morbius*
It really says something about the rest of the movie when a B-list spiderman villain being mentioned somehow caught more of my attention
Why are they skipping the characters villain phase as well as Spider-Man
If I were a vampire I would make the world a better place by feeding on the evil people of this world, TALK ABOUT A HUGE SUPPLY SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE GLORIFY EVIL!😊😊😊
The bats that have a 6 pack he has been looking at are different Batmans, like Val Kilmer Batman and the others.
You forgot when he says “it’s morbing time!”  Best part of the movie!
I like these Pitch Meeting videos.  There are a lot of movies that I'm curious about, but know that I won't enjoy watching them, and these videos give me the ability to get a summary of the plot while confirming ever suspicion I had about the movie.
If you’re picking me up, text when you get here, don’t honk or the neighbors might throw things at your car.
This was one of those cases where less is Morbius
It's been 2 years     Where are you? You said you'd be here by 3
1:25 morbius writer is a furry confirmed ☠️
I've always thought "Morbius" came from "morpions" (french for the kind of crabs that suck blood and you don't want to be too much intimate with)
IMmO the morbin didn't morb enough morbin in his morb... an TmW!
God damn that last part with Vulture actually happened. Tf was Sony thinking?
Nailed it
The executive producer guy writing the finicially motivated parts makes perfect sense !!
Just came here to remind everyone that Jared Leto has an Oscar. That's... yeah
The idea of morbius was cool but the plot made no sense.
these videos are the like drugs, cant tell how often i rewatched these things
A Dragonball Z reference.. man you're really killing it.
was this matt smith? THE DOCTOR <3
come on Jared Leto.  you can do it!  look at Ryan Reynolds, totally tanked with green lantern but killed it as Deadpool on his second time playing the role.  we're still rooting for you.  no one's saying you're just a himbo!
I still have to wonder if that Vulture line was supposed to be a clue as them trying to turn Vulture into a good guy. Why would he say "do some good" and Morbius is supposed to be a good guy like the interaction makes zero sense even for the Morbius movie
This might be how Sony pitch meetings go
Hey I saw this morbius guy in Suicide Squad. Which character did he play there?
he looks like a Calvin Klein model , you know like a bat ? -- ok cool but " what kind of bat  you been looking at ? "
And then he says "its morbin time" "Wowowow"
Bat six pack. Bat pack  Bat man has a bat pack As do vampires  Bat pack
I have seen this pitch meeting ten thousand times and I will pause it for a laugh break every time he says “like a bat”; Ryan George pointing out the hilarious amount of muscles bats have is tight! Love the videos
You know, half of Marvel movies would be resolved in ten minutes if the protagonists weren't such stingy dicks about sharing their inevitably safe and lifesaving superpowers with their dying childhood friends.
"what kind of bats have you been looking at anyway?"
I think that these stories are so terribly disjointed because they are created with a story board and are not actually written.
"You want me to spruce up any of that dialogue?" "No, not even worth the effort!" -said almost every Hollywood screenwriter of the past decade.
Two things; Morbius was a good movie and Leto was great at that character. I hope we see him in the new Blade movie.
THIRTEEN HOURS WITHOUT A NEW COMMENT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
You defied my expectations when the executive became the pitcher! A+++++++!!!!!
4:09 Those are Synonyms 😂😂🤣
Depressing state of affairs that this channel has basically infinite content to work with.  AND YET.  The amount of actual, original, funny writing in each of these is legitimately tight.  Even as they cleave to their own highly specific formula each time AS WELL.
Ryan’s gonna pick me up at 3! How exciting.
i literally heard more BS (morbius) when he mentioned the movie name 😂
HAHAHA love
Loveee
Great job.
Ooooh, right. This was back when Marvel Studios was a money printing machine. Not a money furnace.
like a bat xDDDD
Its morbin time
"Spoilers ahead" I'm not sure it's possible for you to spoil this movie anymore than it already has been.
turned himself into a "living vampire" you forgot the "living" part.
In defense of the Spider Man references, the only reason I am aware of Morbius is because he had a cameo in the old Spider Man cartoon.
Poor Matt Smith.
movies are made by idiots for dumb people. All of its screams ADHD/ADD pandering to the tic tok generation with their short attention spans
Loved the "true blood" accent on "Vampiiiiiiiiiiireeee"
I am still waiting for the comeback of morbius and vulture
Morbius is without question the most movie I have ever.
I'm surprised there were no "Morbin' time" references in this 😹
Why does everybody forget the eight people he killed on the boat??? He's a murderer. He kills more people than Milo
I.. what? Listening the plot of the movie hurt my brain… 🫠
People love to hate this movie spoiler alert it’s not that bad…venoms movies are
"Like a Cavin Klien underwear model." That's it! I have been trying to figure out what look Hollywood actors are going for in their body upgrades because they never really look...functional. Now, all I want to know is why actors transitioning to the underwear model form always have to mention they eat boiled chicken breasts but never mention Steroids and HGH.
I loved the part when he said "It's Morbing time"
Too bad because in the cartoon, Morbius was a pretty intriguing character and it sucks that Sony butchered it so badly.  This had a lot of potential, and it was squandered.
The girls that did Madam Web thought they were in a Marvel studio production.
"how did he get up there so fast?"  "Wasn't easy" - Egg Shen, FBI
Jacked like a bat!
This is one of my favourites 😂😂😂
"Calvin Klein models", "What bats are you looking at?"🤣🤣
Evil Matt Smith is tight!
The fact this has a higher Rotten Tomatoes audience score than Shrek 2 is a crime vs humanity. Shows how powerful memes can be and if it's not because of that then people are insane.
Watching this reminded me just how completely insane and nonsensical the Sony superhero movies are.
My favorite part was when morbus yelled “It’s morning time” and morbid all over the place
hollywood needs to stop hiring middle school kids to write movie scripts.
Oh man some of those lines in Morbius are so cringe i have a headache
I'm confused, isn't Morbius a DC character?  At the very least I thought he had nothing to do with Spiderman.
watching this movies was mostly just saying WTF the whole time
Literally died when Ryan said "Its Morbing Tight"
I was wondering how police got to the top of the building so fast for five minutes
Morb
It's a good movie, I own it.
After watching this I realized I didn't finish watching the movie.
interestingly enough, they got Jared Leto because vampire bats are a kind of predator, and Jared Leto is a kind of sexual predator. So it’s kind of like method acting in reverse
I like how Ryan split each scene up to be different chapters in the video to further sell the joke of each scene never referencing each other
The "you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" isn't only like the line from "the other thing" actually is a line from it. In the Edward Norton Hulk adaptation he's hiding in Brazil and says "you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" line before the factory fight because he gets the Portuguese wrong.
"OH and we hired the doctor to play the bad guy also Morbs bestie and he's somehow sexier than Morbius. Also a better actor.
"He looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model, just like a bat"  "... what kinds of bats are you looking at?"
This pitch meeting is better than the movie.
If only the average shitizen knew.
I wonder if these screenwriters were on strike… for this…
I like how the video start with "SPOILERS AHEAD" disclaimer as if anyone is going to watch the movie.
I had something to say but I didn't put it in my comment.
Bats are kind of shredded. https://acflory.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bat-muscles.jpg
Please do a pitch for "chopper" mate. It's a great Australian movie
Best channel
This giving a thumbs up is barely an inconvenience
I like that the Producer constantly recognises stupid things but then turns around and suggests stupider things.
It's just been remorbed
lol
Pitch meeting or plot holes meeting 😅😅😅😂
The only way i would have ever watched this amazing *Film*
I literally fell asleep while watching the movie 😂
I'm assuming you check old videos? please pitch the move Genie - 2023
him saying he would kill himself to save humanity then not killing himself to save humanity always bothered me but now that I know every scene is a clean slate, I can let it go. THANKS PITCH MEETING.
"What kind of bat you been looking at"  "Batman of course"
It’s morbin time
I would love to see a pitch meeting for Hereditary.
"What kind of bats you been looking at?" Batman. Duh.
I didn't completely hate it, but the whole thing was predictable from the very beginning.
The folks at Sony pictures should watch the 90s Spider-Man Saturday Morning Cartoon and see how to use the villains and you know... Spider-Man.
This guy shredd even Nat Geo if you let him 😂😂😂, my hero!
Im sorry but I hate this guys voice
Watching the movies you're like "oh wow this is so awesome" but then watching pitch meetings and hearing them talk about it and you're like "oh my God, why did I think that was so awesome, this movie sucks."
You never said “It’s Morbin’ Time.” 😔
I finally got around to watching Morbius not that it is on D+. Now I can finally watch the Pitch Meeting.
As soon as you said I'll just honk when I'm outside...someone honked outside.
I feel like this is the ONE Pitch Meeting that didn't need the Spoilers Ahead warning at the start of the video just because of how terrible this movie was.
I'm not gonna lie I actually had a lot of fun with this movie.
"Those are synonyms" floored me for some reason
4:43 there it is!
Oh I was waiting for "it's Morbin time"...😮
I actually physically laughed in the theater when I first saw the trailer
And then Madame Web happens...😂😂😂
2:51 “Why is he an evil vampire?” Because ‘good’ vampires are boring, and Matt Smith isn’t boring.
Why do studios keep thinking casting Jared Letto is a good idea??
Dracula movies worked for years keeping him the undisputed villain, why was this hard..?
Morbs should have simultaneously peed every time he drank blood, like a vampire bat. DNA y'know.
A great compliment to a screenwriter is NOT getting one of these.
Anyone watching this after the Madame Web Pitch Meeting?
It's been many 3s for over a year now, I'm still waiting!
Let’s be honest, Morbius wasn’t that bad in the grand scheme of things. I’d love to see him again as a support or even in a sequel.
"those are synonyms" 😂😂😂
I waited for THREE HOURS!!
6:09 my man sounds like john mulaney

The site's critics consensus reads: "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania mostly lacks the spark of fun that elevated earlier adventures, but Jonathan Majors' Kang is a thrilling villain poised to alter the course of the MCU."  Closest to Inhumans- Secret Invasion- The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 53%, with an average score of 6.1/10, based on 197 reviews. The site's critic's consensus states: "A well-deserved showcase for Samuel L. Jackson, Secret Invasion steadies itself after a somewhat slow start by taking the MCU in a darker, more mature direction."   The Marvel Razzies-1-Morbius-On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 283 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Cursed with uninspired effects, rote performances, and a borderline nonsensical story, this dreary mess is a vein [sic] attempt to make Morbius happen."[112] It ranks as the 16th worst-reviewed superhero movie on the site.  2-Daredevil film-On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes 43% of critics gave the film positive feedback, based on 228 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The critical consensus reads, "While Ben Affleck fits the role and the story is sporadically interesting, Daredevil is ultimately a dull, brooding origin story that fails to bring anything new to the genre."  3-Howard The Duck-Howard the Duck received mainly negative reviews from critics.

It's not even an interesting train wreck. It's just a boring, lifeless slog easily shooting to the top of the list of the worst things the MCU has produced in its near-decade of existence."   The DC Razzies- Catwoman-On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 3.2/10.

The website's critical consensus reads: "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice smothers a potentially powerful story – and some of America's most iconic superheroes – in a grim whirlwind of effects-driven action."
Writer: None of that really makes sense at all. Producer: Doesn't matter!!  And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is Hollywood from tv to silver screen
"Pretty much every scene is a clean slate"... That sums up pretty much every movie that's coming out these days
James and the Giant Peach Mrs Doubtfire
"That's kind of like the line from the other thing!"
lol I love watching pitch meetings when I’m high, he jacked like a vampire.
He might lose his bat 6 pack..  a bat pack if you might
You would double your views aka your money if you did pitch meetings for more black movies
"That was in the bus scene..." "Every scene is a clean slate..." Pitch Meetings are priceless.
I feel like vultures main concern should be getting back to his universe to his family which was his entire reason for doing crime in the first place.  Also he only went into crime for money there wasnt any other reason for him doing stuff. So why would he want to do good when all the reasons are opposite to his personality.  I know that like this is funny haha pitch meeting and is a year old but like i just thought of it now. So yall who see this can have my mad ramblings on a bad movie
I love how even Ryan wasn't able to touch on all the crazy/stupid things that happen in this movie.
I liked the part where Ryan said "it's pitchin' time" and then pitched all over the producer.
I kinda like the idea, but the storytelling and all the PG13 with vampires, is ridiculous.
I watched Morbius and it was really great. The special effects and Milo having a great time being free, fast and strong.  My only issue is how he didn't inject himself after killing Milo. Other than that, it was super fun.
Milo was Morbius' first victim in comics
*to be fair* bats got to have great upper body strength in order to, y'know, fly, and they have evolved some "tricks" to make their muscles work harder than in other mammals.  Side effects includebut are not limited to: being full of diseases
My favourite part was when he said:It’s Morbin time and morbed all over the place
Ever pitch and morb until you morbed and pitched all over the place when it’s pitchin morbin time
It was the best decision i made to follow this channel 😂😂😂
Came back after I watched this very forgettable movie!
I thought it was a pretty good movie
All hail to lord morbius
Want me to sprouse up any of that dialogue?
Patiently waiting for Kraven and Madame web pitches
They're basically part of the MCU. Did you know that?
I particularly enjoyed the moment when Jared Leto yelled out "WE'RE BELABORING AN INCREDIBLY TIRED FORMULA."   And then that exact concept became a meme in and of itself, which was then also unapologetically trundled out ad nauseum to rapidly diminishing returns as well as handily functioning as a microcosmic representation for an entire era of entertainment that's demonstrably in its death throes, especially as evidenced by the fact that this seven minute, sarcastic plot synopsis video has more memorable moments and convincing acting than a film Sony spent close to one hundred million dollars to produce.
I had to check because it's so unbelievable. Yes, the Vulture scene dialogue is EXACTLY that.
Damn this movie was such a try hard
Of all your pitch meetings, this was definitely one of them
Wait. So pitch meetings are now on their own channel that I’m on?
Isn't that the actor from one of the vampire movies? He was in lord of war at any rate.
"He looks like a Calvin Klein model" "What kind of bats have you been looking at?" "Bat...man."
Worst Actor and Worst Supporting Actress at 43rd Raspberry Awards- The Sole Marvel Razzie of 2023 -Morbius  A new Marvel Razzie Arrives Its Razzieing time
Screenwriter guy down bad for Silverwing.
After the Hulk's and Morbius' catchphrases, I'm now terrified of the superhero who says, "You wouldn't like me when I'm HORNY!"
“Those are synonyms.” 😂🤣😂🤣
'More BS' was the working title.
Make screenrant write a Lawrence of Arabia article, we need a pitch meeting soon
Still waiting for that honk
There is actually one movie I REALLY wanted to see the pitch for, even more than this movie: Lawrence of Arabia
The best part of Morbius was the Internet all working together to convince Sony they would watch it ironically so they'd rerelease it and then it flopped twice.
Wait did yall really not mention the FBI agents cybernetic arm that the movie also didn't mention?
Having unclear things in movies is tight!
Wudnt Toomes be in distraught for not having his wife and daughter in this world.... Intriguing!...
MCU: iron man I'm guessing Comics: Thanos Crazy we have to differentiate
I've been waiting for you Ryan.  Which 3 did you mean?  I really need a ride and a Titanic Pitch meeting.
SEBAI
6:23 producer's eye didn't twitch when he says "were part of marvel now" which means he's not really with Sony, which means he's a secret Disney agent sabotaging this movie
producer often fails to point out to writer "i don't know" isn't an acceptable answer since he wrote the damn script!
I liked the movie.
It's  morbin time
Picturing a jacked bat with six pack, if totally messed up.
This is my favorite pitch 😅
It's not that terrible of a movie.  I think if they didn't go full CGI fights and had more grounded action it would have helped a lot.  It's better than Thor 4, Ant-Man 3, The Eternals, and Shang Chi (though, that's not a very high bar to clear).  Not a good movie at all, but people were acting like it was the worst comic book movie ever when it's not even the worst Marvel film in the past 3 years.
"What kinda bats you've been looking at, though?" "Batman"
All of the hype about working multiple aspects of the Universe into this movie is tight!
I totally forgot this movie was ever made! Wow.
wait... producer guy usually says he will see me next time, at the end of the video when he talks to me... can he see me? how often is he watching?
Somebody answer that phone
One thing I don't understand. when does he say: It's morbin' time
Who ever thought the "singer/whiner" of 30 second from arse is a good actor should be fired.
"Its morbing tiiime"
Definitely an unpopular opinion, but I enjoyed Morbius.
The edit they did with his face is arguably more scary than the actual face in the movie
I keep Morbin back to this video.
The movie was ok but could have been phenomenal if they made it R rated and left out all the fucking stupid one liners from other marvel characters.
"You know, like a bat"
Morbius is easily defeated by the words "abracadabra", "hocus pocus", and "Walla Walla, Washington".
They....they didnt say the thing......
I'm actually quite sad that there's no Man Bat jokes in here
You're my lingonberry
Still better than Twilight Batman
This is the only pitch meeting that somehow helps me sleep better than weed does.
Super morbius barely a morbing time
This is a different scene so that scene doesn't matter anymore...brilliant...😂
I still can't believe that people let this movie bomb, then gaslit Jared Leto and the studio over the Internet into believing the movie was somehow wildly popular enough to re-release it, then let it bomb again. What an absolute madhouse Hollywood has become.
I'll just honk when I'm outside 😂
They should do a sort ot Pitch Meeting about rereleasing Morbius and how that went
The main problems with this movie was the badguy, the script, and the PG13 rating
Just honking when you're outside is TIGHT!
There's a forget button? Why wasn't I aware of this?! I wonder if it works 🤔
I was outside at 3, Ryan.  It's been a year now, and you're still not here. I'm beginning to suspect you weren't sincere.
"Sir, that's from a previous scene. You keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie... you don't have to do that. Pretty much every scene is a clean slate!"  Modern movie writing in a nutshell.
Super barely. Easily inconvenienced
Oh man. I only found out about the fact that the “It’s Morbin Time” line isn’t real
Transcript (formatted):  PRODUCER So, you have a movie for me?  SCREENWRITER Yes, sir, I do. So, I was thinking we keep making our way down the list of Marvel characters Sony can still use.  PRODUCER Oh hell yeah! We're basically in the MCU now, did you know?  SCREENWRITER Yeah, I mean everybody in this building keeps telling me that with big smiles on their faces, but with one eye twitching for some reason.  PRODUCER We're pretty much a part of Marvel Studios, did you know that?  SCREENWRITER Yeah, alright, sir. So, I was thinking we make a movie about Morbius.  PRODUCER I love it! Hey, let's get some Spider-Man involved in here.  SCREENWRITER Actually, he doesn't have much to do with the script I've written here.  PRODUCER But we're allowed to do it, so let's do it. Let's put, like, a Spider-Man poster in the background or something. People are gonna go nuts.  SCREENWRITER Okay.  PRODUCER And then we put that in the trailer.  SCREENWRITER But it's not gonna make sense in the movie.  PRODUCER Well, that's o- We don't have to put it in the movie. As long as it's in the trailer, that's what matters.   SCREENWRITER Kinda feels like false advertising.   PRODUCER Yeah, let's do some of that. That sounds great.  SCREENWRITER Well, okay then. So, this guy, Dr. Michael Morbius, has this rare blood disorder and he's gonna die, probably.  PRODUCER Uh-oh.   SCREENWRITER But then he develops a potential cure by combining human DNA and vampire bat DNA.   PRODUCER Oh. Sounds super power-origin-y.  SCREENWRITER It is! But then he tests this thing on himself on a ship in international waters and turns himself into a vampire.  PRODUCER Ohh.  SCREENWRITER Yeah! So now, instead of being all sick and thin, he's jacked and muscular. You know, like a bat.  PRODUCER That's not really what bats are known for, but I'm glad you're excited.   SCREENWRITER Dude's freaking shredded now. He's got, like, a six-pack. Looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model, you know, like a bat.  PRODUCER Okay, cool. What kind of bats have you been looking at, though?  SCREENWRITER So, when Morbius turns into a vampire, he's going to kill a bunch of mercenaries on this boat, just tear them to shreds. There's going to be blood everywhere.   PRODUCER PG-13.  SCREENWRITER There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere.   PRODUCER Nice.  SCREENWRITER So then, Morbius starts to figure out his powers. He's got, like, bat sonar. He's very strong. His nose goes upwards.   PRODUCER Oh, super-powered upward noses are tight.  SCREENWRITER But he's got to drink blood every six hours or he's gonna get sick again and lose his bat six-pack.  PRODUCER Oh no! So he's gotta keep killing people?  SCREENWRITER No, because we want Morbius to be a good guy. So, he's drinking this synthetic blood he developed.  PRODUCER Oh, okay. Great.  SCREENWRITER But he can feel that that's not gonna sustain him forever. Sooner or later, he's going to need the real thing. He's going to be like, "You won't like me when I'm hungry."   PRODUCER That's kind of like the line from the other thing.  SCREENWRITER It sure is, sir, kinda.  PRODUCER Wow, wow, wow. Wow.  SCREENWRITER So anyway, Morbius also has this childhood friend, Milo, who has the same blood disorder, and he wants to take the cure too.  PRODUCER Oh yeah, understandable.   SCREENWRITER But Morbius is like, "No, this is a curse. So, you die and I'll figure this out. Okay?"  PRODUCER Kinda rude.  SCREENWRITER Kinda. And also, there's this sick little girl that Morbius is taking care of. At a certain point, he's gonna have to put her into a coma.  PRODUCER  Oh no! Is she gonna be okay?  SCREENWRITER I don't know.   PRODUCER You don't?  SCREENWRITER No. We ju- He puts her in a coma and we never come back to that storyline.  PRODUCER Oh, okay. Well, I hope she pulls through.  SCREENWRITER  Me too. So eventually, Milo does take the injection thing, and then he frames Morbius for a vampire murder of a nurse.  PRODUCER Oh, why is he an evil vampire?  SCREENWRITER Because the movie needs a bad guy now.  PRODUCER That makes sense.  SCREENWRITER So, Morbius gets chased by the police and these FBI guys, and he flies up on top of a roof.   PRODUCER Very exciting.   SCREENWRITER And then, once he's up there, one of the FBI guys pulls a gun and is like, "Enough!"   PRODUCER How did the FBI guy get up there so fast?  SCREENWRITER Unclear.   PRODUCER Oh, okay.   SCREENWRITER So, Morbius ends up breaking out of jail, and now he's on the run.   PRODUCER Thrilling.   SCREENWRITER Yeah, and at a certain point, his assistant/love interest, 'cause they're both attractive, is being followed by the FBI.   PRODUCER Uh-oh.   SCREENWRITER And she manages to lose them and gets on a bus, and Morbius is already on that bus.   PRODUCER How did he know she was gonna get on that bus and get on it before her?  SCREENWRITER I don't know.   PRODUCER Fair enough.   SCREENWRITER But he's got no choice but to talk to her all secret-like, you know, he's a wanted man.   PRODUCER Of course.   SCREENWRITER So anyway, they go sit in a coffee shop and have a little chat.  PRODUCER But I thought you just said they needed to be, like, incognito.  SCREENWRITER Oh yeah, sir. That was in the bus scene. This is a different scene now, so that doesn't matter anymore.  PRODUCER Oh, okay.   SCREENWRITER And then, Morbius overhears some bad guys talking about this lab they run. So he goes and hijacks it from them.  PRODUCER Oh, you know what? He should scare one of the guys and be like, "I'm Venom.".  SCREENWRITER Right, okay, that doesn't really make sense.  PRODUCER But we're allowed to do that. We should do that.  SCREENWRITER  It's just even if this is in the same universe, we've never made it seem like the average citizen knows the name Venom.   PRODUCER But that's an interconnected thing that we can do, and it'll be good in the trailer.  SCREENWRITER Alright, anyway. So then, Morbius uses this lab to create a new injection, and he's like, "To bats, this is lethal. To humans, it's deadly."   PRODUCER Those are synonyms.  SCREENWRITER  Yeah. And so his plan is to kill Milo and then himself.  PRODUCER Oh, himself?   SCREENWRITER Yeah, he thinks it's his responsibility because he's turning into a vampire. You know, he's gonna have to kill people eventually.  PRODUCER Wow, very selfless. You know, that's a good- that's a good sacrifice.  SCREENWRITER So then there's going to be this big fight between Milo and Morbius.   PRODUCER And then what's going to happen?  SCREENWRITER A whole bunch of stuff. I'm almost sure of it. It's going to be pretty impossible to see. But they're going to start on a roof and end up in a sewer.  PRODUCER Oh, nice.  SCREENWRITER And now Morbius has to find a way to kill this guy.  PRODUCER Is that gonna be hard to do?  SCREENWRITER Actually, it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.  PRODUCER Oh really?  SCREENWRITER Yeah. See, he does, like, a Dragon Ball Z move and shoots a bunch of bats at Milo, and then injects him with the thing.  PRODUCER He can do that?  SCREENWRITER Yeah, because, see, because of the gene slicing bat-human DNA injection, the bats see Morbius as a brother.   PRODUCER Didn't Milo inject himself with the same thing?  SCREENWRITER He did.  PRODUCER Okay.  SCREENWRITER So yeah, that worked out great.   PRODUCER And so then, Morbius injects himself?  SCRENWRITER What? Why would he inject himself? That would kill him.  PRODUCER Well, because of that thing where he said it's his responsibility 'cause he's gonna drink human blood.  SCREENWRITER Oh yeah, no, sir. That's from a previous scene. You keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie. You don't have to do that.  PRODUCER Oh, my bad.   SCREENWRITER Yeah, pretty much every scene is a clean slate here. Oh, also, his assistant - she's a vampire now because why not?  PRODUCER Yeah, why not?  SCREENWRITER And, so that's about it. What do you think?  PRODUCER Well, it sounds like a good time, but needs more Spider-Man references, for sure.  SCREENWRITER Well, okay. Uh...  PRODUCER I'll tell you what. We can use that Doctor Strange spell from "No Way Home" as an excuse to get Vulture in this thing.  SCREENWRITER Vulture?  PRODUCER Yeah, we could just have him kind of pop up in a jail cell and be like, "Hmm, I hope the food's better in this joint."   SCREENWRITER That's not really how Doctor Strange's spell works.  PRODUCER Then they could just let him out of jail because he hasn't done anything wrong in this universe, technically.  SCREENWRITER Right.  PRODUCER So then he can fly in with his Vulture suit and meet up with Morbius.  SCREENWRITER How does he have a Vulture suit in this universe?  PRODUCER And he can be like, "Not sure how I got here. Has something to do with Spider-Man, I think."  SCREENWRITER It's just, I think that suit was made with alien tech from the first Avengers movie, so he doesn't have access.  PRODUCER Then he could be like, "I'm still figuring this place out, but I think a bunch of guys like us should team up and do some good."   SCREENWRITER Ah!  PRODUCER And then Morbius can be like, "Intriguing."  SCREENWRITER That's- Okay, none of that really makes sense at all.  PRODUCER Doesn't matter. Now we can put Vulture in the trailer. It's all connected. We're part of Marvel Studios.  SCREENWRITER Do you want me to spruce up any of that dialogue?  PRODUCER No, not even worth the effort.   SCREENWRITER Alright.  PRODUCER Amazing.   SCREENWRITER So, who should we get to play Morbius?  PRODUCER Well, tell you what, I hear Jared Leto's looking for a new superhero project to kind of redeem himself after Suicide Squad.   PRODUCER Oh, well this sounds like the perfect project for that.  [Smash cut to ScreenRant article: "Why Morbius' Reviews Are So Bad" - After several delays, Morbius finally introduces Jared Leto as the living vampire of Sony's Spider-Man Universe. However, his debut is met negatively.]
Just out of curiosity, blood drinking bats can sustain themselves with blood of pretty much any animal… Has Morbius at any time in this movie even tried animal blood?
Just revisiting this pitch meeting for the morb of it
Like a bat 😂😂
For Anyone Who's Still Considering Watching This Movie To See If It's As Bad As It Is.............. It Is........ So You Know Don't See It.
This was a horrendously shit movie, and I even went into the cinema with the intention to like it....
I heard it was the morbious of movies
I literally forgot this movie was even a thing
This movie had an amazing begining of about 1 hour, then they forgot the middle, and cut to the end with a shit climax that felt like the movie was rushed
Every scene here is a clean slate 😂😂
'this isn't about morbi me or morbi you ; it's about morbi us !' I cried real tears
"Each scene is a clean slate."
it's morbin time, oldie but a goodie
Isn't the dark knight jacked  I mean they could've been more original or new but whatever
I think it's about time for another re-release of this movie!
Yes sir I do!
You know, it's been about a year now. I'm starting to think you're not actually coming...
Morbius was utterly terrible..
I love when ryan says "It's Pitchin' Time" & he starts pitching all over everything
I can imagine a crossover with Blade. Hope this is where they are going.  Gonna check now if Morbius/Blade comics exist
Morbius doesn't deserve the memes it gets
I love that he used the EXACT dialog from the after credits scene and it sounds like something a producer would say lmao.
Just encountered this character in a video game (Midnight Suns) and HE'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING AND FUN! How studio movies butcher these characters is crazy, they didn't even talk about the "living vampire" stuff and that's the whole schtick! This was just a bad vampire movie, nothing to do with actual Morbius lol.
This is actually better than the movie
I wonder if Ryan will eventually end up doing Ed Wood movies. Argyle sweaters and heavy drinking is tight!
--Me, excitedly starting to watch Morbius: "I wonder why this movie is so hated..." --Me, 15 minutes into the movie: Oh, I get it now."
False advertising is tight!
Cool
1:15  what about the bat from DC
Jerid Leto: *Tries to be original joker* Fails Jerid Leto: *Tries to be a by the numbers character* Fails  The fails regardless of what he does, its kinda sad 😐
Lol! So good. Sony really didn’t know what they were trying to do with this film. Especially that post credit scene. The dialogue did not feel like the Vulture/Adrian Tombs we met in Homecoming.
I wanna see this movie, so I can judge for myself even tho I know the film has bad reputation!
toight toight like a tyga
Ryan didn't have to put a spoiler alert at the start of this, because let's be honest, no one cares about being spoiled about bad movies.
I only just now noticed the eye twitching 😂😂😂😂
This makes perfect sense 😂
Actually it's going to be easy, Barely an inconvenience 😂😂😂😂
as a writer i wish i had a guy to say of course to me like that xD
That's false advertising sir Let's do some of that! Laugh at that every time
"Not even worth the effort " sums up hiw ibfeel about movies latley
RIP deleted user Manhog Sonic
"He puts her into a coma and then we never come back to that story line" I feel that says a lot about the film and the amount of care put into it 😅
Missed a chance for: "Putting people into a coma is tight"
you missed one thing at the end.... when Dr Strange reversed the spell, Vulture was supposed to go back to his universe just like other Spider-men, villains and even Venom.
If you think about it, these plot holes got by everyone from everyone from the actors to the editors lol
They did some false advertising alright. They advertised to me that this was going to be a good movie.
"Kinda sounds like false advertising..." Yeah! Let's do some of that! That sounds great!  omg lol
I thought morbious was a matrix movie....
Milo's real name is Lucien.
Why can't Morbius drink donated blood from the hospital?
finally saw the movie and its at least better than suicide squad, which isn't a high bar but yk, more coherent than aquaman
You want me to spruce up any of that dialogue? Producer: no not even worth the effort😂😂😂😂
I am always looking forward to a new one of these. They never get old and always make me laugh. Thanks again for another good laugh.
Would have been fun if he mentioned the second flop
What kind of bats you been lookin' at, though?
MORBIUS SWEEP!
Just saw the movie, and honestly don't understand why the internet hates this movie. It's a decent movie, nothing exceptional, but still decent. And most people seem to love Spiderman no way home, even though that's a terrible movie that seems like it was written by an 8-year old. People have no taste
Those are synonyms
I honestly enjoyed Morbius more than Ant man Quantimania.
"Those are synonyms"
This movie was garbage.
🤡 *IT'S MORBIN' TIME* 🤡
your my favourite twin boy band.
Jared Leto should quit acting.
Uh...  what?  And what?
“ You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry”  Yep
To be honest, until the last second I've belive batman will show up...    Well he did... 😐
hijacking other people's lab's is tight
This movie already sounds absolutely ridiculous as it is, and they didn't even mention Matt Smith's super weird dancing routine out of nowhere.
Bat powers granting super strength = stupid  Spider powers granting super strength = duh Also spider senses. But no venom.
Bro, it's 4:51, where are you?
"PG-13"
"Ekse. Poop my pants my hands. Poop my pants my pants poop my tent my tent. Poop my spenda spend. Have sex." ~Milo Morbius, 2022
I was 100% convinced Ryan had just adlibbed the Vulture bits...
I've watched Batman and can confirm that bats are jacked and muscular
Go go power Morbers...
You should do the lost boys movies
How about we collectively stop watching these garbage movies?
"what kind of bats have you been looking at?" Lmao
IT'S MORBIN' TIME!
I am avoiding so many movies these days.
I was one of the first people who ever saw the Morbius trailer, and it looked amazing, but then I constantly heard about it getting delayed and then after it came out I only heard people memeing about how bad it was. I have not seen the movie and I have no desire to because I don’t think I could handle my disappointment after the bar was set so incredibly high.
it would be funny if you did a Made in Abyss pitch meeting
Still waiting Ryan, no honks yet I'm hungry
I am supremely disappointed that you didn't say "It's morbin time" even once.
Morbin meeting
I watch literally all of these and never get tired of them.
I can't even say if this is a real movie re-telling or they just made this all up, since i didn't watch the movie
"Kinda feel's like false advertising." "Yeah let's do some of that, that sounds great!"
Im ok with spoilers this time lol
Bro, I have been waiting here and I haven't heard any honking since 3:00.. you know like 10 months ago.
My favorite part was when Vulture was like "It's Morbin time!" and Taco Bell was like "THAT IS NOT YOUR SLOGAN BITCH!"
the worse the movie, the better the pitch meeting
“Those are synonymous” I don’t think I’ve laughed so hard
Didn't watch Morbius. After hearing about Vulture, I decided to check that after credit. I literally wrote "morb" and Youtube recommended me "morbius vulture" xD
This movie was nothing but false advertising lol most of the trailers didn't happen in the movie
So actually Michael morbius had combined the dna with that of spidermans with an experimental ray acquired from doctor conners
Should have told them "We are Venom." Cause we all know that was Venom's thing.
there needs to be a Goosebumps Pitch meeting... lol RL stine just casually creates life with a magic type writer and creates a whole daughter after killing the first one, and then just lights the book on fire at the end..
Morbius has become such a meme that when he said the characters name is Dr. Michael Morbius I just burst into laughter.
I liked it morbius was like " It's time to MORB!"
It’s morbi- uh… pitchin time
„So he‘s all jacked up like a bat!“ „What kinda bats have you been looking at?“ Honestly the best joke ive heard all day.
Still not watched Morbius
ryan stood me up :( he didn’t come at 3
I was wondering why i was getting so bored of the movie I kept stopping it. Thanks for sparing me from having to watch anymore of that crap.
I forgot to forget the forget button and now I forget which one is the forget button.
He was always "jacked" (he really isn't though) probably because of his background. Most male friends that had severe childhood diseases for a long stretch that they overcame are genuinely extremely fit and jacked now as adults like they are compensating and making up for lost time or insecure or something. It is pretty common in my experience. Doesn't seem strange. He had to have felt a certain kind of vulnerable at some point that he doesn't like and fits with the character.
I wish I could stay home, get baked, and watch Pitch Meetings all day.
They forgot to talk about the aftermath meeting: "Wow look at all the memes ! We should totally re-release it !"
"it will be good in the trailer"
I'm a huge fan of vampire movies.  Most of them are not great, but I enjoy them.  Months back I was visiting a friend.  He had Netflix and asked if I wanted to watch Morbius.  I'd heard nothing but terrible things about it, but I agreed to watch it because hate-watching bad movies is fun.  I can see why people were disappointed if they went in expecting a comic book movie.  But honestly as a fan of vampire movies this was firmly average.  I mean seriously go watch Underworld and see how it stacks up.  Plus Matt Smith was just so much fun to watch.
They got SO much dirt on Jared
Please do a pitch meeting on: #1 - The Room #2 - Birdemic: Shock and Terror #3 - Battlefield Earth
The biggest 'wtf' moment for me in Morbius was when Morbs needed a quick fix for blood. He got super lucky though as he was walking down the streets. A couple of paramedics were on scene at an apartment, and they were carrying blood with them (which I'm pretty sure paramedics would rarely ever just happen to have on them?) And even more fortunately, they enter the home while leaving the blood super conveniently outside on the front steps. They very easily could have continued carrying the cooler into the building with them, but they decided to leave packets of blood completely unattended like a Mark Rober glitter-bomb package.  It's also weird, because this is framed as a 'morally good' way for Morbs to get his fix, as he can just swipe the blood, not having to murder anyone. ....But I suspect that in taking that blood, he probably just killed whoever it was intended for.
Hah
My favorite part is when the writer says, "It's pitching time!"
YouTube and shown a rent option of "the dark tight" under this video... I wonder...
When the pitch meeting is better than the movie 😂😂😂
Vulture: "Something about Spiderman I think" Morbius: " I don't know who that is"
This earned a like as soon as he said "oh, they're synonyms"
Dudes freakin shredded😂
I have a terrible suspicion Sony’s going to make “The Amazing Spider-Man 3” and put Morbius and Venom in the movie and then advertise it like it’s a Sony avengers movie
This is exactly the mindset Sony has right now!
"What kind of bats you've been looking into?" This was very funny!
Saw the movie. Very neutral on it. This pitch was fantastic though lmao
Have you ever dissected a bat? They're like 90% pecs.
I'm not sure what my favorite lines are from this series beyond the obvious. I think it's "I don't know" said with a smile. "Unclear!" is a close second. This is marvelous--the worse the movie, the better the pitch meetings!
The waffle house has found its new host
No “whoopsie” 😢
I like Calvin Klein's bats 🤣
6:18 someone make this a meme
5291to comment
He's jacked and muscular.. y'know.. like a bat.
Wanna see the meme but don’t actually care about the movie. Here is the video for you, diet Morbius
False advertising. Yeah. Lets do that.  I crack up.
The movie wasn't really that bad. Only a little below a typical MCU film at worst. Different tone, for sure, but solid if you like that type of film.
"I'll just pick you up at 3" while rubbing his eye is the most realistic joke in this video lol
"That's from a previous scene...pretty much every scene is a clean slate". About the level of editing, continuity and referential integrity we've come to expect from 99% of the movies these days... _sigh_
Calling Adria Arjona just 'attractive' ... wow wow, wow wow wow, wow...
i feel like more people saw this video than Morbius.
Me looking at the watch at 4:30 and looking out the window still waiting for Ryan to arrive: :|
it's morbintime all the time!
Producer: “…what kind of bats you been looking at, though?”
the only reason Jared Leto is still allowed to act in movies is so that these pitch meetings can happen
You're making me realize I'm way too good at the whole "temporary suspension of disbelief" thing 😂
We need a Pitch Meeting for a How It Should Have Ended (HISHE) video
Glad someone made fun of vulture's involvement
I like the movie tbh
Banner actually says “You won’t like me when I’m hungry” In hulk 2008
You completely forgot to pitch about the part where morbius said: "it's morbing time" and morbed all over the place
I like how this whole video is basically why Morbius is a shit movie. Don't mind it at all.
To be fair bats have to be pretty jacked to be able to fly. As a mammal it lacks many of the adaptations birds have that make them great at flight like feathers or hollow bones. Bats rely on just flapping like mother fuckers.
Leto has turned into a weirdo and it’s not to far fetched to imagine that he actually does drink blood
Help! I forgot to forget the forget button!
I love how each PM character takes turns being the voice of reason at random intervals.
bats have super-strength?
That was really one of the first things I thought about Morbius' new look: "Oh look he got abs, he got... strong like... a bat"
Oh please, they just need to release it for the third time. It sure will collect morbillion dollars now.
It was truly a morbin morbed morb
Hearing "Me too" from the one with the script- (2:40)
Watching this actually was a inconvenience 😂
1:22
Wait.. didn't they use the "you won't like me when I'm hungry" line as a translation error joke in the Hulk movie with Ed Norton??
My favorite part of Pitch Meeting is when he said "it's pitching time" and pitched all over the place. Truly one of the meetings of all time.
i managed to completely miss both morbius releases and still didn't miss out on anything
It's Morbin' Time!
Well... I hope she pulls through.  😆😂😆😂😆😂😂😆🤣🤣😂  I love how this channel points out the story lines that are always forgotten about. You don't realize when you're watching the movie but then you see this and it's like wow that is dumb. 😂
"This is a different scene now so that doesnt matter anymore"  "Oh okay" 😂😂  I died 😂
Super morbin movie, barely a morbinvenience.
"So then he's all jacked with six-pack abs. Like a bat!" "What kind of bats have you been looking at?" umm. . .Batman?
i`m very fun at parties, I know. BUT... Lethal - 100% death. Anything that is lethal will always kill you. example - decapitation  Deadly - chance of death.  example - being hit by a car.
My favorite part was when he morbed into our memes but 90 percent of us never even saw him morb on screen
Morbius is just a crappier Blade. Vampire who uses a substitute for real blood because he doesn't want to become what he hates but when he does have real blood becomes more powerful. Seriously... Blade has way better fight scenes and the movie actually makes sense.
“Those are synonyms”
Morbius is definitely one of the movies of all time
The scene where he meets Vulture might be the worst thing I’ve ever seen😭😭
Jared Leto should stay the hell away from bats
Jared can’t catch a break
Thank you so much xDD I needed that, after watching the actual movie ... and I have to say: EXACTLY! xD
all in all i think Morbius was pretty good. i dont know why the back lash.
Kind of disappointed he didn't touch on the fact that the guy takes the injection with NO information what so ever on where the injection was in this lab full of things you can inject. As well as no knowledge that there were multiple doses made.
It's fuggin' MORBY TIME.
I'm addicted to these pitch meetings. Fucking cheers! LOL
“Super powered upward noses is TIGHT!”
That would've been "kinda cool" if Vulture had a more "comic-style" suit in the sony-verse. Not that it matters. It'd still be pretty bad.
It's Morbin' Pitch.
You gotta do the movie Slayers 2022, please or Jeepers creepers reborn, or Psycho goreman
compared to the most 2022 movies. Morbius is actually not that bad. lots of this people only hating because they dont have their own opinion. 😂 i wonder what kind of movie this people like that they are not afraid to say it in public. they probably say no way home LMAO
Sounds even more ridiculous when described out load, lol. I watched this at home…….and some time after the first half I fell asleep. Not making that up. Marvel, like DC have endless comic books dating back over 50 years! 50 years or more of successful writing! THERES ACTUAL TEMPLATES FOR THESE CHARACTERS, JOB DONE. THEY DONT NEED REINVENTING!  So what does Hollywood do, they hire writers who we ALL know by now don’t bother to consult this readily available vast library of references. Todays writers have basic character info phoned in to them via Dixie cups and string near a busy train station.
It’s pitchin’ time!  This movie has 1 MorBillion% on rotten tomatoes #sweepmorbius #itsmorbintime
Was 7:03 why someone was honking in my driveway at 3 am?
You didn't do the meme.
"He's jacked and muscular, you know, like a bat." Still laughng, man.  Had to pause the video.
The ONLY reason to keep making MCU crap is for these brilliant pitch meetings. They sd just give the budget to Ryan.
Also the origin of the Kirk Langstrom version of the Batman in Justice League Gods and Monsters.
Poor Jared Leto, always stars in roles where the writers shaft him.
FBI guy has morbius powers also
I actually really liked this film!
Want me to spruce up that dialogue? Not even worth the effort! Laughed my ass off. Shit wheres my ass!!
The "LIKE A BAT" gag had me in stitches.
even my eyes were twitching when ur saying that
My favorite part of this pitch meeting is when the writer said "it's pitchin time" and proceeded to pitch all over everyone
My favourite part of the movie was when he said “∜morb=b×α+⅔
"Kinda sounds like false advertising..." -"Yeah that sounds good, let's do some of that."
Sweet. I don't have to check in with screen rant and not subscribe now. I'm so glad it's its own channel now
he forgot to say morbin time
Pretty much every scene is a clean slate. Yeah, that's about how the movie went.
If they wanted "the vulture" they most likely could have just made an alternative one. The fact they specifically shoehorned the MCU vulture in using 100% not the logic established in the MCU screams they are trying to get off on a technicality/loophole in licensing. They struck a deal with Marvel to allow a venom baby to enter the MCU, and by doing so made a direct connection to their own sonyverse. They used this connection to rewrite the rules of this connection and bam. I predict Sony is already casting for their spiderman (if they are not just going to use Andrew and absorb his movies into the sonyverse canon).
I was ready at 3. Where Ryan?
PG-13 is why the world has to pretend that 10 year olds are the funniest guys in the room. Disney/Marvel are in control of the global laugh track, and it truly is behind more sad adult faces on an international scale.
How are we going to get the Sinister 6 in? Super easy, barely an inconvenience.  OK We'll take a small plot hole OK And shove a huge square peg in it Ooh It'll be tight Yeah, real tight But we'll push it harder even though it won't fit...
some films ill like to see a pitch meeting, lier lier, nightmare on elms street, child play1-3 and final distension
seriously thats the plot? its vampire bat blood?? god thats fucking lame
I just finished watching the movie Morbius and they made a good movie except It is nonsensical as skillfully indicated here. I don't understand why these modern high budget productions can't have a story without 763 impossibly ridiculous things to believe along the way.
We need a pitch meeting for th re-release
not a single mention of the greatest line in cinema "it's morbin' time", shame
I love how many people talk about this movie and how few of those people have seen it 😂, me included of course
Comment for engagement! ❤
It isn't a proper Morbius pitch meeting, until you release it twice.
Movie seemed dumb in the spider-man cartoon in the 90’s  Spider-Man’s blood made him a vampire I prefer that connection
I loved the part where he said "It's pitchin time" then did a backflip snapped the bad guys neck and saved the day, truly one of the scenes of all time
It's morbin' time!
Is Jared leto’s career over yet? When I blow a multimillion dollar deal I probably would see my job on the rocks
Lmao
Pitch Meeting channel is tight!
I loved it when Screenwriter Guy said "It's pitchin' time." and pitched all over the place. Truly one of the pitches that happened, I decided.
I know it has nothing to do with anything but who is in the photos in the background.... sometimes they are there and sometimes they are not. Just curious... I feel like I know you slightly from watching so many of these and a shout out to your friends or family seems like it is ready
Okay I can’t stop laughing! “You keep referencing things characters did or said” before and every moment is a clean slate here; you’re making this too complicated😂  LMAO
I know what bats he's been looking at. Batmans.
Its pitchin time!
My favorite part of this episode is when Pitch meeting guy said "It's Pitching Time"
Watching Jared Leto acting career go down the drain is TIGHT!!!
WTF Ryan you didn't honk at three! I was waiting!
morbius is a dead stick who thinks he is a method actor by being a dead stick.
Jared Leto is absolutely terrible
What, no mention of the smoke trails? Or the flying without wings?    The bats going along didn't seem as bad as that they somehow became balls of force.
Its morbin time chain👇
I really should watch this... I am wondering if it's just bad bad or room bad its good...
Sony thinks this little of people’s intelligence.
Pretty much…
Do Ambulance
This is exactly what jared leto deserves
It's 3:05 I'm starting to get pissed 😤
That ending made me giggle snort. I'll see you at three. I guess I'm staying up till 3am just in case.
The plot of this movie is so bad it almost makes the pitch meetings hard to watch. I just feel bad for Ryan at this point.
I love the part when Screenwriter Guy yells his iconic catchphrase, "It's super easy, barely an inconveniencing time!" and super easy, barely an inconveniences all over the bad guys.
If he need blood can't he just go to a blood bank
“Those are synonyms.”
"What kind of bats you been looking at tho?"
I know this was meant as satire, but I honestly don't see how the pitch/story meetings could have gone any differently irl.
*Insert "It's Morbin' Time" joke* Here
Am I the only one who thought this movie was actually good I thought it was better than both venom movies
This guy makes me a little depressed. I mean don't get me wrong, I love his work. But he makes me feel like the reason I can't sell any story I write is because it isn't shitty enough.
Out of all the movies ever made, Morbius was definitely one of them.
Is Milo is friend or his brother?  I'm also reading that Milo is Loxias Crown and I'm quite confused with no idea who to trust. (Can someone tell me so I don't have to watch the movie?)
Thanks for picking me up, ryan. I really appreciate it.
Vulture lol.  I love it.
So now I don't need to watch movies to find out how bad they are. Wow wow wow           Wow
You know, like a bat.
It's tightning time Ryan !
As someone who's never seen morbius still this movie sounds ridiculous LOL
2:14 missed opportunity to go "wew wew wew" or something.
Jared Leto is a legend in his own mind
But wouldn’t hitting the sidewalk or buildings at that speed kill him? I’m going to need you to get all the way off my back about that
Definitely one of the pitch meetings of all time.
Another movie I don't need to watch.
✝️✝️✝️
Producer guy started pitching his ideas by the end of it all
"...blood everywhere!" "PG-13." "Blood sound effects everywhere..." LOL!
i actually thought this movie was great besides the weird scene with the shirtless dancing guy
I watch these pitch meetings both to review movies I have not seen, and to confirm all of the ridiculous story progressions, obvious and not so obvious plot holes and overall affects the lazy writing that forces writers into corners they can never get out of.
So he did not say " It's morbing time " and morb all over the naked women with sticky bat juice ?
Boy it's no wonder this movie made Morbillions and spawned the Morbius Universe which went on to make the CEOs multi-morbillionaires..
I watched it a few days ago and managed to avoid most of the spoilers. Funny pitch as always, but am I crazy for not thinking it wasn't THAT bad? Most of the plot holes outlined here can be explained one way or another.   -Yeah getting jacked makes no sense, but so did Spiderman. Are we gonna nitpick every gene-spliced hero? -He has echo-location, so finding his assistant and getting on the bus she was heading for is doable.  -The cafe might be in a neighborhood where they both know nobody's gonna call the cops on them.  -Matt Smith's character is shown multiple times to be morally grey and have a mean streak, not crazy to imagine a scenario where the serum warps him a bit more than morbius. -They show Morbius making an effort to bond with the bats. Matt Smith didn't. Regardless of how realistic that is, that's what they were trying to draw from.  If it weren't for the super cringey Matt Smith dance scene, I'd give it a 7/10.
This video was better than getting Morbed in a back alley for money.
I'm still waiting for Ryan to pick me up
Idk, it wasn't my fav but it was a good watch
DRAGONBALL Z MOVE IS EXACTLY WHAT I SAW! hahahah, I did not enjoy the movie but I loved this pitch meeting it is spot on.
Interesting how the tables turn and how the producer is pitching at the end of the video
The pitch meeting was several hundred times better than the actual movie.
Sony's MCU is the original MCU in movies.
Morbin time was tight.
Sony: It's Marvelin' time
Anybody else go watch movies specifically so they can watch the Pitch Meeting?   I seriously would have never watched this movie if this series didn’t cover it.
I think he should make a pitch meeting for movie trailers.
Orginal Suicide Squad whole movie needs redemption, but the roles that were great and no apology needed...Joker, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Diablo, the soldier, and the mean lady (the names are in the grey matter, I just can't find the file)😂🤣😂
Is there a reason Morbius can't drink from donated blood bags?  I feel like that would be a lot easier than killing people, plus then his buddy could have taken the "cure" since noone has to die for them to survive.  I haven't watched the movie but I am curious if there is a reason.
Aww batman is tight
My favorite part was when he said "its morbin time"
This pitch meeting honestly makes me feel like the movie was too good. 😂
I love how so few people saw it that you had to put in clips from the movie.
Just watched this with my wife last night and thought all this stuff. She thought I was being cynical and not just enjoying the movie. But I mean cmon
Dude, you F*ing killed him
beautiful
1:28 "Okay cool. What kind of bats you been looking at though?"
Can u tak about "Venom: Let There Be Carnage " cause that movie was so so short that I blinked i pritty much missed first half of the movie !!
He should have said "I'm Batman"
This pitch meeting explained everything on how stupid this movie was. Except that Morbious is a murderer even tho he claimed he wasn't. He killed all those people on the boat.
It wasn't a terrible movie.
Should re-release this pitch meeting but it just be this exact video.
"Synthetic blood he created", soo... why not use coconut? Can't it be a temporary substitute for plasma?
Its pitching time
Spiderman Is ripped like a spider lol
Let Go Leto! 🤮
Tru Blood 🚫!
This is very very shit mate
*_I finally got a chance to see Morbius™ and I enjoyed the hell out of it!! The action, special effects & chemistry between cast members were great! I also enjoyed the references to Spider-Man™ & the Daily Bugle™!! Good stuff!!_* 😁🏆  *_"With Vampire 🧛 power, comes Vampire 🧛 responsibility!!"_* 🤗
Pitch Meeting makes this movie better
"There is going to be Blood sound effects everywhere".  You have know about Hollywood and their thing about blood. ;)  LOL
That is a genuinely scary thumb nail.
Look, I love a good Easter egg as much as the next Marvel/DC fan, but Sony? You're pushing it again. This is why you don't have a good track record
I watch bad movies so I can enjoy Pitch meetings to the fullest
The only good movie Jared Leto ever played in, was Requiem for a Dream.  But I'll never forget how so many ppl for some insane reason thought he'd be the best joker. Honestly he comes off as a whine ass. Especially if you've ever watched the documentary about the music industry he made.
the vampire faces in buffy were better than in this morbin shitshow. holy cow.
Wait... I forgot which button...
Poor Jarod Leto
2:53 nato with nazi and russia
I don't wanna be mean, but I'm ok with Jared Leto's mask of being a good actor is finally melting away.
How come you didn't mention his catchphrase "it's morbin time" and morbed all over those guys
This pitch meeting gave me a huge Morb-on
I never understood why he actually stopped on the roof.
Morbous
Imma do it  _It's Morbin'' Time_
This video has more views than the actual film it's making fun off
I've got to start working out so I can get a bat six-pack. I have the abs of a platypus currently, weakest abs in the animal kingdom.
This channel is brilliant.
You know the dialogue was terrible when Pitch Meetings just uses the actual dialogue from the post credits scenes to make fun of it.
So good cause the movie was so bad 🤣🤣 you must have been frothing when you watched this pile of crap!
It is Morbin' time!
Ryan is the best actor in existence, he said Jared Leto was attractive  with a straight face
Please do Masters Of The Universe.
Pitch meeting suggestion……..⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ BAD BOY BUBBY ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️………a beautiful story of a single mother, and her beautiful struggle to raise her son on her own…………lol………
Feels bad when the pitch meeting gets more views than the movie!
I watched The Night Flier {1997} last night, it was a much better movie.
Vampires are NOT PG-13.
I can't believe this is better than the actual movie.
- Kinda feels like false advertising - Yeah, let's do some of that, that sounds great  Brilliant. So glad I finally found the Pitch Meeting that had this exchange
The best part is when he says "Its morbin time"
0:00 There's no need for that
this movie was so flat.. i love matt smith but he cant even spark interest in this for me.  i thought live action cartoons where supposed to be fun.  they seem to be getting dull.
It’s Morbing time!!
Morbius: Morb  Morbius 2: It’s Morbn’ Time Morbius 3: Into the Morbverse  Morbius 4: The Morbn’ Menace
never knew bats had cum gutters before.
It’s Pitchin time
That's not really how Dr strange's spell worked lol 😂
It's morbin time!
These videos are amazing. That being said your voice gets soo annoying after a while.
He's looking at batman
Can you believe that this was the first movie to make a morbillion dollars
People say a lot of things are cringe these days, but that Vulture scene is the true definition of it.
We all can see your bias Pitch Meeting.  Morbius is one of the released movies in this history of film.  Nothing you do or say can change or minimize that.  It is one of the scripts ever written with special effects done some of the artists to ever do film.  So don't be jealous and prepare to morb
I'm so glad I didn't watch this movie.
I hort Mikey Morbey
1:43 “It’s Morbin’ Time.”
How come no one comeup with stories that connect Morbius with similar characters of their universe? i mean Blade,Selena,Dracula must be wary of Morbius or atleast keep his "vamipiric" shtick under control.  1st movie was little boring, childhood friend betrayal - Oh my gwad - its like before generation X idea.
So I'm thinking, if they had you actually sit in on some of these pitch meetings, would it create a paradox?
I haven't watched this movie because I heard it was horrible but I'm definitely watching the pitch meeting
morb
I just saw it and I personally don’t find it that bad.
Honestly surprised Ryan put the spoiler warning on this one. Come on man... nobody saw this movie.
I like how both the guys are trying to talk sense into the other through logical arguments from time to time, but they both continue to come up with increasingly ridiculous ideas themselves 😂
Jared Leto ehhh
Another fantastic summary of why I haven't missed anything :)
Why do I keep forgetting about the forget button?
"Morbius"? I think we need a little LESSbius, am I right?
"I don't knowww" "Fair enoughhhh"
😂😂
what time is it?
Milo the food drink of champions.
Morbius is a cinematic masterpiece
I've made a terrible mistake. I clicked on this video in a sleep-deprived lapse of judgement and now I know things that happen in Morbius
Can't believe the part where Morbius looked at the camera, shouted "It's morbin' time!" and morbed all over those guys was ad libbed.
'He puts her I a coma and we never come back to that storyline' Brilliant film making..
I can finally un sub from that ass click bait watch mojo knock off
All jokes aside, Jared Leto managed to star in both the worst DC and the worst Marvel movie.
"I'm BAT man"
"That was in the bus scene this is a different scene now so that doesn't matter anymore." "Oh, okay."  killin me XD
"Pretty much every scene is a clean slate here." I love it how he's just casually droppign the ultimate secref ot hollywood script writing.
Why was he drinking human blood, bats don't usually drink human blood, he didn't have to exclusively drink human blood, he was basically fully cured and that was not a curse, him and his friend were stupid
Wow wow wow... Wow! 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Absolutely lost it when he said "Those are synonyms." 😂😂😂😂
Morbin time
Nothing about “noble prize”?
This channel is comedy gold.
He's jacked and muscular.. like a bat 😂😂😂
It’s morbin time.
I'm watching that last part at 2:41 D:
I've really been looking forward to seeing this movie. . .  Pitch Meeting.
Morbius was way better than venom
Where do I get the barely an inconvenience shirt?
I love this movie because I've never seen it and don't know what's real and what's fake.
Sony: “ Intentionally making bad movies to bomb Disney is TIGHT”
No Batman joke?
Very sound and hilarious 😂
My favourite part of this episode is when he said “it's pitchin' time” and then pitched all those films!
Jared Leto gives himself to an industry who doesn't think twice to shit on him and his method performances.  If only he could provide that level of seriousness with his music, but he'd rather just shit on his fans instead.   Shit on me economics, I suppose.
I loved this movie.
Every scene is a clean slate lol 😆😆😆😂😂😂
Can't believe it didn't mention anything about the best line in a superhero movie: it's morbing time!
"What kinda bats you be looking at"  Me:batman
I love how the writer(s) of this movie don't seem to comprehend that bats aren't really supernatural creatures. 🤣
Its morbin time
Pg 13
It's actually a little sad that you find as much stuff to make fun of in a bad movie as you do a good movie.
Do you want me to spruce up the dialog?   NO, not even worth the effort!
"want me to spruce up any of that dialogue?" LMAO!!!!!
When Jared Leto said," It's Morbin time!", That is the best part. I felt emotions.
I liked morbius more then thor L&T and Dr strange 2
What kinda bats have you been lookin' at though?  LOL!!!!
I'd much rather watch you tell me how bad a movie is with out seeing it for myself and just using your opinions as my own :)  you have saved me like 60 bucks already
I just had a theory...what if changing the deaths of those characters changed the trailer?  Edit: it was 12:24 in the morning when I thought of this....
You forgot the part where he says “It’s Morbin time” truly my absolute favorite part of the entire film
Actually it’s gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience😂so classic
Its pitchin' time.
Damn, I am so happy I just watched this video and not the actual movie... xD
What should have been a rated R movie turned to a PG-13 Twilight fanfic...
Bro Morbius is the fusion of Wish Reanu Keeves and Wish Venom
It would have made more sense if Morbius was from the TASM universe and continued Dr. Connors' cross-species research that was established in TASM 1. It would have given a reason to have Andrew Garfield appear for a cameo.
I am not interested in seeing the movie and I have nothing morb to say about it.
A: what happened in the movie?  A: a bunch of things, I'm sure of it
Let's put vulture in there at the end and make him say stuff and team up with morbius and then 2 days later delete the footage from all screenings so that way people get confused about why spider-man and vulture was in at all.  Okay 👍
I mean… they did cast Jared Leto
Milo sounds like the guy from amazing spider man 2 who needed Peter Parker’s blood. Did they just copy that plot?
My favourite part was when morbius morbed a backflip, morbed the bad guy’s neck and morbed the day.
Thanks for the rundown, I won't even dignify it with pirating lmao
Pitch Meeting for every movie in the Alien franchise please.  Separate videos.  One after the other.  So I can see the descent into  complete corruption of artistic integrity.
I morbed so hard watching this
morbin'
It's Morbin' Time
Was this made before the, "it's Morbin time," meme? Cause it would have been hilarious for the executive to suggesting adding the line only for the writer to say, "we're DEFINITELY NOT going to do that!"
Pitch Meetings : SPOILERS AHEAD !!! Me : so ???
I usually hold off watching pitch meetings until after I see the movie but I have zero interest in ever watching Morbius and will be actively making every effort to avoid it at all costs.  Difficult, you say? Actually, it's going to be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.
Its a funny meme but it wasnt as bad as most people make it sound. Pretty generic.
Wow wow
doesnt this story kinda sound familiar to amazing spiderman 2 lmao?
6:27 "no, not even worth the effort" is an elite line, make it recurring please!!
*These guys:* "it was not about morbi me or morbi you but morbi us to make this movie great"
This movie pitched morbed so hard.
Freaking hilarious! 👍
Sucky movie that dident have to be made.
Watching only pitch meetings on screen rant is loose not tight yeah yeah yeah wow wow wow wow wow.. WOW 👌aaah magnifice (French accent)
It's always funny when either one of them stops smiling, like when one of them says something so BATshit.
This Pitch Meeting makes the movie sound much more interesting than it really was...
pre-Morbin' time pitch meeting
I am probably one of the six or seven people who is legitimately a fan of Morbius as a character, and my disappointment over this movie is almost as strong as Jared Leto's line read on "I'm beginning to morb!"
Love me some Mikey Morbz.
Please don't come to my house at 3. I mean who knows, you could be a jerk in real life and I don't want my perception of you ruined.
wow, a movie so dumb I fell asleep duringt he pitch meeting.
Jesus saves!
@ 00:57 the "uh oh!" kills me!! 😂 LMFAO
You wont like me when I’m hungry is also what Ed Norton says in Incredible Hulk
This is one of the morb movies of all time
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO THE IRISHMAN! PLEEZ!
Nobody says I don't know better than Ryan
Great episode.  However, I'm a little disappointed that you didn't talk about Milo dancing by himself, as this was essential to the plot.
He gets jacked with six packs like a bat.  Bats don't have six packs.  He looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model.  What kind of bat are you looking at? 😒
The pitch meeting: “Let’s make the greatest movie of all time”
sony is bigger than Disney still
Wow. It was worse than I thought.
*His assistant died though???*
I morbed when Dr. Micheal morbius morbed his brother morb
Will you do The Water Man?
It's a shame, that these are better than the Movies...  Or is it....???
It’s morbin time
I can’t believe you left out the part where morbius said “it’s morbin time”
I thought the first 1/3 of Morbius was the beginning of a masterpiece until his old boyfriend started taking his vampire cocaine and just immediately turned super evil and instantly turned on everyone he's ever cared about with absolutely no build up whatsoever. Life long friend and father figure just became completely irrelevant. The back and forth between them as far as action and dialogue were just silly. The PG-13 rating was such a terrible idea it's beyond comprehension why they keep making all the movie adaptations we adults waited our whole lives for into campy disasters with rushed disconnected storylines that only uncaring new generation children can watch without cringing at the plot and silliness of it all. They should all be rated-R and be taken more seriously plot wise. People don't just decide to murder the only people close to them without a second thought after obviously caring about them.
Cloverfield!!
I'm technically a MCU charecter
I’m glad you watched it so I don’t have to, you missed the part where he says “it’s morbin time!”
I want a set of the Mightly Morphin' power rangers that were featured in the film, right after he said: "It's Morphin time".
Milquetoast
Everyone going wild for the meme line but I got so hyped when dude asked Matt Smith his pain level from 1 to 10 and he said Eleven.
And matt smith essentially reprises his role as the Doctor but as an evil vampire
It’s morbin time
Jared is not a good fit for super hero/ villain movies.
I saw it today and I'm upset that i didn't watch it in the theater. It was pretty good. I give it a 7.5
We need Blade back.
Lol “spoilers” like there is any chance I’m watching this movie
You forgot the part when he said “it’s morbin time
Why Morbius reviews are so bad: because the main protagonist is not an overpowered misandric woman. Seriously, movie was actually decent, and that’s the only reason I think it gets such hare.
Please use the synonyms voice again in more videos. 4:10
Pitch TITANIC. PLEASE.
I liked the first half of this movie...hated the second half. Jared Leto was okay as Morbius, but oh...the whole thing. Just...no.
It certainly was a movie that had characters
This pitch meeting was unmorbievably good. It's a morbin' shame that the movie didn't do better.   ...   morb
Guys it was better the second time it released, I swear
I can't believe they skipped the part where Morbius says "It's morbin' time" Most hype part of the entire movie. The ENTIRE cinema would have flipped out at that part when I didn't watch the movie, if anyone had been in the cinema and if they had the sense of putting that into the movie.
MORBIUS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. IT IS BETTER THAN OLD BOY OR ANY OTHER MARVEL MOVIE. YOU ARE JUST JEALOUS, THAT YOU WONT MAKE SUCH A GOOD MOVIE (except if you are working on "Morbius Part 2: The Rise of the Morb")
I really REALLY hope some Sony executives look at this and feellike the fucking morons they are.
I want some Sony producers and writers pitch meeting. They try up and come ideas to make obscure Spider-man characters with awful story lines
The das Thing is,it is how it probably went down 1:1
I have taken my pilgrimages to the theater to watch morbius once a week When it's morbin time
Morbius should have been an easy layup. I mean he's anti-hero vampire who kills villians. He's a hideous monster who wishes to before human. Marvel could have done some wonderful things with Morbius.
why didn't he use fruit bats that would had been the perfect choice . lol
I fell asleep for half the movie so thank you for catching me up on the plot
What happened to the old videos?
Where is the pitch for putting Morbious back in theaters?
I think I'll be a screenwriter. Seems easy enough.
01:28 - " What kinda bats have you been lookin' at though?"
I love how this pitch meeting shows that Sony was responsible for ruining this movie. I get that it was made before No Way Home and things had to get changed, but it was still a very bad idea to have Vulture cross into the SSU instead of having Michael Keaton play a variant of Adrian Toomes. In the future, Sony SHOULD do their homework on the MCU and the multiverse, AND keep in touch with Kevin Feige if they want to continue drawing connections between universes.
Finally, the pitch meeting for the movie of all time
The movie ever
Can you do a sequel about how they bought into the memes and put their movies back into theaters only for it to bomb a second time
Welp...if anything, Jared Leto can always fall back to his cult as a new career. Plenty of middle-aged women out to simp for him.
Mighty morphing morbing
Didn’t see the movie. Did he ACTUALLY say “it’s morbin time”? 😂
It's Morbin time!
can you pitch star trek the wrath oh khan?
Btw, it's now 4:30, not one honk yet...
This wasn't a bad movie but I wouldn't say great I don't get what the big fuss is wasn't a terrible movie
I honestly don't see the problem vampires would face in 2022. There are literal vampire cults. I'm sure he could easily find a group who would donate blood to him. There is no reason to kill people.
Do the Elvis movie!! ⚡️
Kept waiting for a "it's morbin time" joke. Imagine my heartbreak when I discovered the line is never actually said in the movie. One minute silence for this earth-shattering revelation.
I have not seen this and am happy
Jared Leto is a cult-running loon. He sucks.
I made so many Morbius memes and this is the first time I actually hear what the story is about
Funny video and all, and love pitch meetings.  Are we all going to continue to ignore the quite significant number of sexual assault allegations made by underage girls against Jared Leto...  Seems like the dude is a known predator yet somehow gets a pass for superhero movies,  You can Google pretty much a whole bunch of related searches, and the sheer number of similar stories is pretty shocking in its own right.
That part where vulture and Morbius morb everywhere is tight
Sick girl is obligatory black person.  Wow wow wow.
Why couldn't they survive on blood bags??? I get the blue blood was not enough but what about real blood bags. He's been surviving his whole life on blood transfusions, so clearly he has access to an easy supply and besides we see at one point that he has a whole fricking fridge full of them!!!! The whole thing doesn't make any sense
Its morbin time
Pu
Pitch meeting is like telling stories with your friends after you both watched a movie from the cinema.
How have you never done the Armageddon Pitch Meeting?
Pretty much a part of Marvel Studios well ya know plus or minus half a trillion dollars *eye twitches*
RIP screenrant
Feel like blade did it first
Subscribing to you was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
coming next year Morbin' 2: Mo' Morbin
It’s Morbin time
This was one of the movies of all time
Would've loved to see a Man Bat movie instead of this
Being Ryan is TIGHT!!! Morbin tight.
Qns: What kind of bat you looking at?  Ans: Its Batman!
"Those are synonyms" don't know why that made me laugh so hard, but it did
What are the odds that you have a rare degenerative desease and yet there’s just someone else with the same rare condition that lives in you’re exact same city. Great, great writing. They didn’t have to fly the guy from a different country or anything.
Awesome
it's morbing time
I actually enjoyed that movie. I never read a lot of the comics with him in them, so I wasn't familiar with the source material. That helped a lot. There are a lot of holes in the story, though.
This movie sounds so bad even Ryan had a hard time making it fun lol
so glad I saw this before wasting 2 hours of my life watching the movie...only had to waste 7 mins of my life.
"Ok Jared, you were in the worst DC movie of possibly all time, but don't you worry, you still got a shot with Marvel and we got a hot, new project coming up. Connected to Spider-Man, no less!" How did Jared manage to get typecast as 'garbage villain of a comic's flagship character, where said character doesn't even show up'? First as a villain for Batman, who is DC's biggest name, in a movie without Batman, then as a villain for Spider-Man, who is Marvel's biggest name, without Spider-Man.
The scenes you used where truly some of the scenes from the movie.
Yet somehow Sony knows just as much about the multiverse as Marvel does!  So, just what all can Doctor Strange do again? 😏
Dude I absolutely love this film
I check outside at every honk. (。_。)
Morbed totally morbed
I love your 2 characters to talk about the movies!
the scene when he's talking to people had me on the edge of my seat, but then he said it.. "you won't like me when I'm morbin" and I literally fell off my chair along with several other movie goers, we all rose to our feet and gave a standing ovation. a truly unprecedented, incredible moment in film history.
To bats this lethal... To humans it's deadly.. Those are synonyms 😂😂
😂🤣🙏💯
Oh yea, its morbin time.
Morbin time is tight!
I wish I watched this instead of morbius
The fact that this pitch meeting doesn't even reference the line Morbin time is one of the greatest mistakes this channel has made.
"theres gonna be blood everywhere" "pg13" "theres gonna be blood sound effects everywhere" "nice"  for things like this is that i love pitch meeting
Morbius was sick since childhood...a treatment or 2 and he's this uber muscular man bat hybrid? it's virtually impossible for Any fake blood/ bat DNA concoction to cause a metamorphosis medically speaking..... ( young men don't get super powers from a spider bite, either) The science of Morbius is Way off! Bats don't swarm out of a cave because they smell blood! How did Milo get the " bat formula" if it was locked up in a laboratory?? Did Morbius euthanize that little girl? where's the story arc? no interior struggle? The girlfriend was unnecessary as she did nothing to further the story The best thing about this mess was Matt Smith He should have been Morbius, Leto could have made a cameo
Watch the trailer for Morbius Then watch the movie..... 😒🤔🙄
didnt they release a morbius in 2016?
I'm confused, did any of that unrelated spiderman stuff actually make it into the film??? I'm having trouble believing it's not a joke, it's such a scatterbrained idea to be real
I bet the people who write these scripts absolutely hate you just systematically and very accurately crapping all over everything they do anytime they make a big budget film. We love you though, keep it up.
Greatest movie of all time, tbh
Morbius definitely had a plot and characters
My favorite part was when he said, "It's Morbin time." Then he did a backflip, snapped the bad guy's neck and saved the day.
Midbius
morb
i didnt even know about the second end scene credit until i was told here went back to see it. so dumb so very dumb
So Morbius is essentially... Batman adjacent?
Its Morbin' Time
It's morbin' time
Jared Leto was a decent Joker.
Its murbin toom%
I like the part when he morbed.
That sounds like a WuHan Origin Story to me. Well alright then!
“Don’t forget to forget the forget button” omg a hidden gem for those who didn’t leave the vid as soon as the pitch ended LOL
Me: hey pitch meeting can you make a synopsis of a bad movie so I don't have to go see it? Pitch meeting sure it's not hard at all actually barley an inconvenience
Me: this movie sucks... pitch meeting: It sur is sir kinda....
Ryan is amazing
someone should make that movie "Clean slate"
Man’s forgot the Milo dance scene ☹️
Man’s forgot the Milo dance scene ☹️
It's Morbin Time!
Do some classics; team america or Strings both crazy puppet shows
It’s morbin time
I don’t think morbius is that bad
“You keep referencing things from previous scenes. Here every scene is a clean slate.”
Milo went from normal sick dude to batshit (pun intended) insane REAL quick.
It's Morbin time
'intriguing" and "its morbin time" are two of the most awesome catch-phrases now
“He has to drink blood every 6 hrs or he’ll lose his bat 6pk” 🤣🤣. Someone give th is man a Nobel peace prize !!!
Morbius: my review.  Morbius and his cousin Glorbius are living on a farm. Morbius is morbin' and Glorbius is glorbin'. Glorbius is a comic relief character. One time he says "They seee me glorbin', they hatin'" which everyone in the audience agrees is a joke. They live their happy lives. Until one day a man called Worbius appears and he says that the farm is in debt and if they don't pay 10 000 dollars by the end of the week it's going to be reposessed. Luckily there is a talent show in the valley and the main prize is 10 000 dollars. Morbius decides that they should do their morb and glorb routine, but his parents aren't happy about it. His father says that now he needs his help on the farm more than ever and Morbius has no time for talent shows. So Morbius is trying to work on the farm by day and still train his morbin' skills by night, but it is exhausting and he fails on both ends. So his father finds out and there is an emotional scene when he says "if morbin' is really what you want to do, then what kind of a father would I be if I stood in your way? Go on son. Get out of here and morb!" And so he does. For a while it looks like he's doing really well, his morbin' is improving and Glorbius' glorbin' is excellent. But alas Worbius finds out about it and decides to kill Glorbius to destroy his chances at winning. What you didn't know is that Worbius is worbin'. And he is very good at it. He wants to win the talent show and he won't let Morbius get in his way, and besides he really wants to get the farm. Morbius finds out about Glorbius' death and he seeks out Worbius. "You killed my cousin" - he cries. "No" - Worbius answers "I killed my own cousin. Who is also your cousin. For I am your cousin!"  They fight but Worbius escapes.  Morbius is wounded, but still he practices his morbin'. He really wants to win the talent show now.  The day finally comes. Morbius' friends Morbina and Quorbius are in the audience. Morbina is LGBT and Quorbius is ethnic. They don't have any character traits or story arcs, but at least they are in the movie so that's good.  There are some other talents, but finally the time comes for Worbius and his worbin' is exquisite. Morbius never knew that Worbius was this good at worbin'. He doubts himself. But he comes next so he mutters "It's morbin' time", which is the thing that people have heard in the memes. He start morbin', he's doing good, but he trips and falls and everybody's laughing. Worbius says "Give up, Morbius! You're nothing without Glorbius!" which he thinks will break his spirit, but it does the opposite. Morbius now remembers Glorbius and he gets up and starts morbin' and glorbin' AT THE SAME TIME. The audience is extatic, they have never seen anything like this. They award him the first place and give him 10 000 dollars. But then it turns out that an ancient curse is invoked and whichever cousin loses the talent show has to forefit his claims to the farm, so not only did Morbius win 10 000 dollars, but also the debt is absolved. Worbius has to work at the farm as a slave now, as is the custom. Morbius uses the money to throw a giant party for his friends and everyone in town. They are drinking, dancing and morbin'.  In the post credit scene we see a silhouette of a mysterious man zorbin'. It could be Zorbius, Morbius' uncle known from the comic. The screen fades to black and we see a text "MORBIUS WILL BE BACK IN MORBIUS 2: MORE MORBIN'"  All in all I think it was a good movie, great retelling of a classic tale. I would definitely like to see it and who knows, maybe one day I will.
It’s Morbin time
literally more people have watched this video then watched the movie on the re-release weekend
It's Ryan Georgin' time!
want kind of bats you lookin at... BATMAN
It's morbin' time!!
I don't watch trailers anymore. I just wait for the Pitch Meetings
“What type of bats have you been looking at though?” 😂😂
"Pretty much every scene is a clean slate here..." LMAO
Thanks to Covid, I learned a lot about the bats.  And the bats that can use the sonar are the micro bats -- basically very very weak bats.  Mega bats are the actually strong ones.
Have you ever done that awful Noah’s ark movie? The one with Emma Watson in it? It’s atrocious and there is an opportunity for a “pitch” joke. :P
i hate movies in this day and age. everything is either connected to 10 different other things that you have to see in order to understand wtf is going on, or a remake aimed at people who are nostalgic about whatever it's remaking. you cannot just go see a freaking movie anymore without doing research and homework before you go.
this guy is the best critic on YouTube
Dumb and Dumber Pitch Meeting!!!
Honestly, Morbius wasn't that bad. The only thing I didn't really like about it was all the "RAWR" faces.
Morbius is Morbin’ ngl  Also this movie on paper doesn’t sound terrible. except for the villain with the same powers. But the action scenes were kinda cool I guess
Whoo!
I actually very much enjoyed this movie. I finally got to watch it the other day and I thought it was a lot of fun lol
The fun thing is bats have very muscular chests, just like birds. Because they are the main motor for flight. But their arms are really really skinny so they don't way to much to drag them down. So imagine Jared Letos physique would have been transformed into a real bats physique with Terry Crews-like chestmuscles and super shredded abs but with the arms of Christian Bale in the machinist. XDXD
I actually want to see this movie. But on a device that allows me to speed up/fast forward.
Can't believe they finally covered Morbius, one of the movies of all time!
I think the main problem with Jared is that he plays eccentric characters z not robots.
Morbius was better than Ant Man, Dr Strange, Black Panther, Ant Man 2, Suicide Squad (first one), and others I can't remember...
Can you do 'The Cleanse' - So much comedy gold material there
I can't tell if this is satire or leaked meeting video XD
Im not going to waste my time on this movie. Thanks pitch perfect ☺️
Props to Ryan for not even referencing 'Morbin' Time'
Soon I will get to see Morbius which made 10 Morbillion dollars at the Morbox Office making it the highest grossing Morbvie of all time. Critics all agree that it is Morbalicious, and want Sony to give them More Bius now.
1:34 Nice.
Imagine if he'd used fruit bat dna. He'd have been the same, just he would need bananas or kiwis ever six hours.
the thumbnail looks like pelosi answering Biden: cant I just sniff her hair?
"Fair enough" should be replaced by "dumb people's money"
I love that panda shirt
it's the morb time
Alright, sir... So I was thinking we make a movie about MORE BS!
When I first saw "Milo" I was like, what's the Doctor doing here?! I know, Matt Smith finished doing the show nearly a decade ago, but he still looks like the same goofy Doctor we all love.
this video deserves to get morbillion likes
Watching this was actually more entertaining, than the movie this video is based on was.
You were on Film Theory!!! Yay!
the 500 trillion dollar opening weekend movie
Just watched it, didn't hate it, but mostly because it was just entertaining visuals.  The plot was pretty garbage, Milo's motivations made no sense to me at all and they didn't even try to establish why he was suddenly a sociopath or why he was willing to hurt his friend (or even that he was jealous of Michael), and as was mentioned in the video there are just a ton of moments the movie expects us to either forget or accept for no reason.  It is pretty terrible. This isn't like Venom where it was a fun movie to watch and the critics were just whiny about it but fans liked it, this is a movie that even fans are gonna rightly criticize.  But hey, it killed a couple hours, and even though his character was written by the screenwriter's child, Matt Smith plays a fun bad-guy.
"We morb in a society."
Shit, Ryan's gonna be here in 45 minutes.
Who's Milo? Is he talking about Lucien?
I'm still wondering how he's able to fly without wings
Sound effects are tight would have been a good joke.???
1:27 Executive: "Okay, cool. What kind of bats have you been looking at, though?"  Batman: "Sup?"
It has been 2 months, I'm seriously starting to think you forgot to pick me up...
Chicken of the cave
This pitch meeting I feel like is the closest to what actually happened
It’s Morbin time
It's morbin time!
I've watched Morbius in the internet illegally but i still want a refund...
It really makes me sad that Jared Leto is a legitimately good actor but he just keeps getting in shit roles with shit writers.
Is morbin time
I just watched it.. Unbelievable, the entire movie didnt a have a single scene that even remotly made any kind of sense. Literaly, not one scene.. I cant understand anyone evolved. The writers ? They cant be human, maybe an AI wrote that without any kind of previous input ? The actors ? I mean they read it, right ? How would you say yes to something like this!? And cmon, there must have been a test audience.. apes ? Lizards ? Mice ?  Im absolutely baffled.. my only explanation is that their target group are blind + braindead people. Thats gotta be it.. I need therapy now..  Oh btw my personal favourite was the cop comparing 6l of blood with 36 beers!?!?!? 0,16ml a beer !?!? From what dimension is this movie please ?
i want a pitch for the re release
Sony screwed up with this. Because of Incursions the sony Universe can die since Adrian Toomes ended up their. Sony you messed up
Mum don’t come in I’m morbing
i wouldn't have watched this movie if it wasn't for the memes 😂😂 honestly it's not that bad, i was expecting something that rivals Josstice League but it's just your typical boring marvel movie with some questionable plot things here and there, i'd give it a 5/10
This need a rerelease
I liked him as Moribus
Fantastically sarcastic. Sarcastically fantastic, even. Oh Ryan, you Scots-Canadian super-smiler. You ARE of Old Scotland somewhere down the line, yeah? It's just that you're Canadian and have tartan as the background at the end of each video. Plus being Canadian? It's 99% certain you have Scottish blood. Not like in a jar you keep in the fridge for sexual powers, but like EVERYONE over there seems to have roots over here. En Ecosse. That's for the French-Canadians. Who don't apply to this particular spiel. Why mention it? I dunno, I'm still pretty squiffy from last night. And I really enjoy yer stuff. Pip pip....😁👍
I loved the premise of Morbious and the characters but I wished that the finale wasn't the same thing as the past 20 marvel movies
man, Morbius was pretty bad. The plot: stupid and aimless, the character development: weak and bad (the antagonist's motivation and character development was a complete 180), the graphics: really goofy and weird looking (also cluttered and hard to make anything out), although some effects were neat. Side characters were 1 dimensional and kind of lame. It just felt really amateur (things just kind of happen and move on at an awkward/too fast pace and without callbacks)  The end credits scene also makes no sense (his motivation) The ending was abrupt and felt like it shouldn't have just ended at a non-climactic part.
Morbius re-release pitch meeting?
Morbious
Yoo
I wonder if leto went and lived in a bat cave for months as a method actor...since he has been so dedicated to all his other roles. Who can forget his practical joker role. Where he sent people things...wat a joker
I hope they re-re-release Morbius in theatres I was sick those weekends.
*someone actually shows up outside honking at around 3pm...
Lmaoooo 2:18 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you don’t wanna dignify the movie with a watch but everyone on the internet is talking about it, so you watch the Pitch Meeting instead.
I like how Ryan keeps alternating who the "straight man" is throughout a single Pitch Meeting.  One minute the executive is pointing out all the silliness, next minute, it's the writer.
1:20 I enjoy the continued narrative consistency of Screenwriter Guy being implied to consume furry pornography.
"What kind of bats have you been looking at?"  "You know the one's in Strip Clubs"
You should make a pitch meeting of Morbius re-release.
This video made me morb so hard I morb-sploded into a morbillion pieces
This has made me wanna watch te movie more than any trailer has. Just so I can come back and laugh even harder at this.
i watched morbius a morbillon times
“It’s Morbin Time!”
I literally fell asleep while watching the movie .. and couldn't finish it .. I can't believe this is a marvel movie 😳
YOU GUYS NEED TO STOP WITH THE MORBPHOBIA HERE OK YOU DONT WANT TO SEE ME WHEN I GO MORB MODE
My mind was blown when he said "get back, I'm about to morb!"
I was wondering where all the pitch meeting videos went, couldn't find them on screen rant,  subscribed !!
Morbtacular.  Morb/10
Don't we already have a bat-oriented super hero? Did we need another one?
oh its morbin time is TIGHT
Morbius is definitely a movie
Can't stand Leto anymore, but the movie did get me to play VtM:Bloodlines again, so I'll give it props for that.
could anyone else taste the thumbnail?
Every scene is a clean slate!  Oh also his assistant is a vampire now. Cause why not?  Yeah, why not! 😅
wish this was made after the whole "morbin time" thing took off lmao
Oh morbin' is TIGHT!
can tou do a pitch meeting on kickass movie??
"You keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie, you don't have to do that" "Oh, my bad!"
Morbius is a movie. I've been told. And I believe it. I Morbelieve it.
Re-releasing shitty movies and having them flop at the box office for a second time is TIGHT!
IT'S MORBIN TIME
The Re-release needs a pitch meeting. I want to see the execs react to the memes and go ahead with it.
"There'll be blood everywhere" "PG-13" "There'll be blood sound effects everywhere"
I thought he was gonna mention how similar the plot is to TASM1  (I didn't actually see the movie so just judging off of this lol)
Damn. Fatal burns.
"We don't have to actually put it in the movie"  Parts of marvel trailers in a nutshell
You didn't even mention the fact that he didn't even say "It's Morbin time"
Morbious
The addressed points are correct and fair, nevertheless I loved the movie, I am obsessed with it. I watch scenes and reviews of Morbius every day 😅😅
My favorite part of morbius was when it ended
You morbin’?
It's morbin time
Have you ever seen the movie WARCRAFT !   it might be the worst sir.
this sure was a morbing movie alright
Here for film theory
“What kinda of bats are you looking at?” Uuuhhhh the Robert Pattinson one?
Pitch morbing
you were awful in the Halo TV series
I think the bat he used as reference is actually batman
That Ryan is looking hot in that t-shirt 😍😍
The line is actually: you wont like me when I'm morby
Well since they released it again in theaters you're going to have to do this pitch meeting all over again. And I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about that sir.
I believe Kevin Feige is gonna get fed up with Sony and inject himself with Morbius DNA and take out these executives one by one. Now that would be a movie I watch.
Disney in a nutshell
Its morbin time
This dudes so accurate with his pitch meetings
IDK why all this hate for this movie !!!! Sure its not perfect but still watchable and better than Venom , F4 and X-men movies ... The problem is with stupid credit scenes.
Am I the only one confused as to why morbius had the ability to control bats or did they mention it in the video
It’s morbin time!!!
It’s morbin time
No one knows if any of these details are true. The only thing about the movie is that he says “it’s morbin time!”
"Alright, I know the movie flopped hard, but what if... we released it again?"
i morbed in my pants so hard watching this movie, i had to change my socks!
ITSMORBINTIME
So, do you have a new movie for me? No sir, I don't. What? Yeah, see, I figured we could just release Morbius again. What, that movie that completely failed, like, a month ago, why would we do that? Well, see, Morbius has become a big meme on social media, so I figured that the people who missed seeing it before would come and see it now, and that could make you a lot of money. I like money! I know, sir. So what do you think? I don't know, do you think it'll be easy to recoup our losses from this? Actually it'll be super difficult, barely a possibility.
But I can see Jared Leto as Gabriel Belmont
That was the best way to describe it... "they're together because they're both attractive." Truer words where never spoken on dumb romantic "backstory" hook ups.  This movie was so stupid and racist too while trying "poorly" to look woke by throwing in the coma girl that they never got back to.
Pitch meeting needed for the decision to re-release the movie after the memes.
It’s morbin time 😤
When you are popular for being pure trash :/
it had no real story. the villain was who again?... nothing wrong with the action or anything else... but the story was so empty
I got 25 minutes into the film and gave up so watched this instead as a shortcut to seeing the flim. Glad I didn't stick it out.
it's pitchin' time
Morbius 2 It's Morbin' Time 🦇
Reviews of this movie were so bad I decided to just watch the Pitch Meeting instead. I'm fairly sure this was a better use of my time.
When Morbius said "Your licence to morb has expired" after killing the bad guy, I felt that...
My name is Michael Morbius but everybody calls me Morbin.
Then morbius did a morb flip morbed the bad guys neck and morbed the day
It’s morbin’ time
Wouldn’t mind seeing the Herbie franchise (or any of the films) in a Pitch Meeting episode
I feel that a second pitch meeting is warranted after the re-release.   Morbius re-release pitch meeting!
Uncle Ben: With great Morbius, comes great Morbiouses.
Leto saying "It's morbin time!" was tight!
Can there be spoilers for a movie that was spoiled to begin with?
Ngl that film was pretty Morbin
It's morbin time.
Morbius is a movie, I can confirm
I didn't even watch the movie but pitch meeting is fine 🤣
That FBI part still baffles me to this day
What I love about Morbius memes is I genuinely do not know if "it's morbin' time" is a real line in the movie, and I'll never know because I'm not going to watch it
1:26 is absolute perfect line delivery
You gotta make a morbius re-release pitch meeting that would be hilarious
What if the movie was about a scientist's fall from grace and out of pure desperation, he reached out to cultists? What if vampires living in the shadows agreed to save him in exchange for unlimited synthetic blood to help their dying race survive? What if Morbius had to escape from vampire hunters and broker deals for peace, and when the movie is about to end, he finds out there is one particular hunter who works alone and is coming for him?
They missed out on a tru-blood joke that no-one would have got
This is probably the only movie I’ve heard of to bomb in theaters… twice.
its morbin time
morbius looks like moistcritikal "Oh, making the main character look like a YouTuber is tight."
This is definitely the plot of a movie. Sounds like a movie.
Why is hollywood obsessed with bats and jacked men? They keep on remaking Batman almost every year and now sony or marvel has also their own version of batman
it's morbin time
"what kind of bats you been lookin at though?"
I can’t wait for morbius 2 where we finally get to meet morbius’ side kick Morb Boy
No Wesley Snipes cameo was a faux pas.
Not only have the googley eyes in the thumbnails never been funny, but they seem to be getting bigger. Eventually the whole thumbnail will just be a big circle.
I'm still morbing
we are allowed to do that so we do that
When Morbius said “it’s Morbin time” it really touched my heart
The world will never be so morbed again
Can we get a part 2 pitch meeting for the re-release? Do it for the morbs
Its morbin time
The movie was so forgettable that not only you don’t have to remember what happened in the previous scene, but it was physically impossible to remember what happened in the previous scene…
Make another one
It's Morbin time.
"I killed Paul Allen — with an axe in the face."
"So you have a movie for me?" "Not really, no" "Sounds SUPER great."
I don’t understand how you could forget to mention the part where he said “It’s morbin time” and “I’m about to morb.”   Honestly this pitch meeting just seems incomplete.  Maybe these pitch guys just didn’t know about it this early. Maybe “it’s morbin time” was just a genius improv line by Jared Letto. That should go on a list of top 5 best improv lines of all time if it really was improvised.
It’s morbin time!
I actually like this movie, AmA.
You know how sometimes you watch a trailer and it is blatantly obvious that the movie is going to suck? And then for some reason you don't follow your instinct and you watch that movie anyway and it sucks even worse than the trailer indicated?  Yeah, that's Morbius.
*I T S     M O R B I N     T I M E*
can i write the netflix movie interceptor pitch meeting script?
Why pitchmeetify a film absolutely everyone has already seen several times by now? We're talkig about morbius here!
The pitch went like this: “It’s morbin time”  The rest is history.
You probably need to do a meme review of this cult classic 😂
It’s morbin time!
So you have a Morbi for me?
"We're basically in the mcu now did you know ?" this is so funny and very true
i just noticed he didnt do arcane  like wtf?
Pitch meeting for elden ring
Does he really say "im venom" ???
it's morbin time
So the whole concept was. Being a hybrid vampire-Human, like Blade. Refusing to drink human blood, like Blade. Having superhuman speed and strength, like Blade Only drinking synthetic blood, but its not enough to satiate his thirst for blood. like Blade. The eventual doom that he cannot contain the thirst for blood and in time, eventually give in to the thirst and lose control. Just..like..Blade.  Conclusion: 2/10 watch Blade instead which was also produced by Marvel, much better movie made 23 years ago. In fact, watch the whole trinity. You wont be dissapointed.  Damn, this movie made me watch the Blade trinity again.
Writing ruined Jared Letos joker
I want him to do 90s romeo and juliet.
The movie surpassed morbillion rectors on the rector scale of nonsense
Thanks for the spoiler warning, wouldn't have wanted to ruin the movie.
In all honesty I feel bad for Jared Leto when it comes to Morbius. His acting was honestly pretty alright, it’s just the writing that sucks
I cried while watching this movie, what a cinematic masterpiece, “It’s Morbin Time” is the single best line in all of cinematic history 💯
you forgot about the first scene in the jungle with the cave that we never get back to
ITs morbin time
"kinda feels like false advertising" "That's, that's a real advertisement"
Huh. Was wondering where the Pitch Meeting for this was and it turns out they finally made a channel just for them.
need an updated pitch meeting about a double 💣  at the box office
someone needs to create a Morbius parody film and include lines like "It's Morbin time"
I swear I've seen a movie almost a decade ago where this guy gets vampire powers, controls bats, turns other people into vampires to defeat an army, then the sunlight kills them all. is that related to this in any way?
If only there were some way for a doctor to remove like, just a little bit of someones blood, not enough to damage the person being drained, but enough for a decent drink, like a pint or so, it really sucks for Morbius nothing like that exists
Honestly, the best part of the movie are the memes... which, like all other good parts of the movie, were left out of the movie.
The four words that will change your life. It's. Morbing Time.
Just came to watch it again bc Sony got trolled.
Producer guy:What kinda bats are you looking at Screenwriter guy: Only a few like Ben Afleck, Christian Bale, Michael Keaton *5 hours later* An that's all  Producer guy: Wowowow...wow.
It's morbin' time
I havent watched the movie. but i laughed at 'every scene is a clean slate'
Every scene is a clean slate. Perfect!
Don't know if you have... But you should do pitch meetings on all of Dick Wolf's creations. Like, I mean, all of the Law and Order series, plus the Chicago everything!
At some point, you can just stop.
I feel like i lost brain cells watching you TALK about the movie
Michael Morbius is the Morbiest Morb who ever Morbed a Morbing Morb!!! Without a doubt, one of the characters in a movie. He absolutely Morbed every Morb that he was in. 10/10 Morbs.
Need a Pitch Meeting of the Morbius Rerelease?
My favorite part of this is giving a spoiler warning like anyone is going to watch the movie.
This movie was such a movie
I’m glad it has it’s won channel. You guys should transfer all the videos from screen rant about pitch netting to here. This is my favorite and Ryan is the best he’s too funny keep working hard man
You forgot about the part we’re morbious says “it’s morbing time” when he morb the morbets!
blizzard, disney and sony seem to be in a competition to see who has more contempt for their audience.    it's actually impressive how they always manage to one-up each other.
Great copy  v10 a10   Ty
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The conflict and charcacter development is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of classic English dramatic literature, most of the weight of the scenario will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Michael’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not only humorous- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth in Morbius’ quote: “I am Venom. <snarls> Just kidding, I’m Dr. Michael Morbius at your service.” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jared Leto's genius wit unfolds itself exclusively on the cinematic screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then, they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin’ personnel kiddoes 😎
Thumbnail made me wheeze for 20 minutes
So Morbius has this childhood friend  fucking doctor who himself
unpopular opinion: Matt Smith should have been Michael Morbius
Its morbin time
Everybody hyped for Morbius 2 It’s Morbin Time?
"i hope she pulls through" and "why not?" were the most used sentences by the producers while referring to the morbiest movie
"It's Morbin Time"
It's Morbin' time
2:16 So...a rip from the Amazing Spider-Man 2 villain motivation page of Green Goblin. Wow- wow- wow!!
Morbius is definitely one of those brain switch off flicks.
its morbin time
The detectives mention "that thing in San Francisco" obviously referring to Venom. I bet you feel stupid now. This must have been the most difficult Screen Pitch to make trying to find faults to rag on.
Edward Norton to inconvenient factory worker: "Don't make me hungry, you wouldn't like me when I'm ...hungry" -incredible hulk
This is how Morbius made one morbillion dollars
It's morbin time
The girl should have gotten the powers instead of Morbius first.  Because Doctor Morbius managed to mix up ("accidentally") the super drug with the other drug that did put her to sleep. (a miracle happened which involved her getting rid of the same blood disease). She loses her normal life and wants to have a normal life in which she finds out that Morbus drugged her for his research to create the perfect weapon/being. The best friend tells her and she kills him which resorts to Morbius drugging himself to get vengeance. Morbius dies a dramatic death which resorts to her getting put into prison and then the movie ends. The prison disappears and she is suddenly in a city where spiderman tries to stop a villain.
It's Morbin' Time!!!
This is the closest I will ever get to actually watching the movie
Those are synonyms
Lol sick little girl storyline just went nowhere. She must have died off screen
This movie was so sad. How can all their movies be so bad????
The meme culture: Haha morbin 7749 Me who watched this video: What the 👁👄👁
This should be owned by DC And titled Vampire Batman
there isn't a whole lot of "wow wow wow" about Morbius... it kind of Sucks Just listening to them try to explain it.....  bottom line....Movie was awful
When the cartoon characters from a kids show has more depth than a 90 minutes long high budget movie.
When did he say the stuff+
morbin
Watching the pitch meetings to keep up to date on the Marvel universe is TIGHT!!!!
Sony CEO @ a press conference: “With the introduction of ✨𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞✨from our friends over at Marvel, continuity? is a thing of the past. It allows us to take screen writing to entirely new levels and create cinematic experiences like never before. To give you an idea of the possibilities ✨𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞✨gives us, lets take a look at the trailer for our upcoming project, 𝕸𝖔𝖗𝖇𝖎𝖚𝖘🧛🏼‍♂️*plays trailer* Now im gonna play those exact same scenes but from the actual film, and you tell me if you notice anything *plays scenes* Did you catch it? The trailer includes subtle 𝙎𝙥𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙧-𝙢𝙖𝙣 🕸 references to get fans hype for the conceptual expansion of the 𝕊𝕡𝕚𝕕𝕖𝕣𝕧𝕖𝕣𝕤𝕖 👯‍♂️. We aren’t yet sure how we are going to accomplish this so to be safe we removed the references from the theatrical release for in the event we decide to abandon the idea it wont be a problem cause “its in another universe” 🙂. Another thing you probably noticed, is the familiar face of the one and only Michael Keaton, The vulture, who we find out got teleported to same universe as Morbius and Venom during No Way Home after Dr. Strange sent everyone back to their respective universes. How was Vulture sent to a universe he didn’t originate from? Well to quote the almighty Emperor Palpatine; “✨𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞✨ is a pathway to many abilities that some consider unnatural.” Another amazing perc we have been gifted, is the ability to jump universes with a transition of a new scene, effectively giving the audience a glimpse into alternate realities but in just ONE movie 😳.  𝕸𝖔𝖗𝖇𝖎𝖚𝖘🧛🏼‍♂️ takes full advantage of this an with every scene progression the audience is introduced to many alternate realities. To the uninitiated these can be seen as plot holes, but they aren’t they a significant component to the story. What we have in store is bigger than big & look forward to bringing more of your favorite comic book heroes (and villains 👴🏿) to life through the power of film.”
Thank you..
Morbius made so many morbillion dollars
This is perfect!
I morbaited to this video
Completely honestly and unironically, this show is the best way to enjoy the MCU
The worst thing is that this might have been the real chat Sonys guys got every new film comes out
this is the most pitch meeting of all time
It's all about the amount of Morbiness in Morbius is what sold me on this movie!
It's Morbing time!
It's morbin time 😎
"What kinda bats you been lookin' at?" It's furries, the answer is bat fursonas.
Ahhh yes watching this video instead of movie itself is super easy barely an inconvenience
I love how I'm alternating between 'he's the sensible one' and 'he's the sensible one' and in fact neither of them is. It was still a Morbin' time though.
Why,....why, why so much violance and lies and death and kills on the entertainement-media's today ? Hollywood and co represents more and more : monsters/gore, murderers celebrating and dope advertising. What they expect from us to do with that ? And......in the very same time : they TURN: NUNS and PREACHERS and PRIEST INTO: BAD GUYS in series, they destroy churchs in movies and most ,they mocking, laughting-at the Lord ( with subtility, I agree ). It's mathematical = they like dope and murderers but not the Lord. It's the proof by Hollywood and co to understand. Do you need a dragon eating your car in front of you to realise ? ( For N.D.E belivers : Jesus is in so many witnesses and storytells from all around the world ). Don't be afraid/ASHAMED to just...talk with him, you can even talk with JESUS in secret, while nobody notices it. Or you can ask him help in a very sad day. If you, now, reconise where is the devil, make the total OPPOSITE WAY from what he advises you in whispers, from the lightedscreen. GOD BLESS YOU.  (:-)--/---(
so Jared Leto is the worst DC character as well as the worst Marvel Character... Wowowowow
Wait, this movie had a script?!
I haven’t watched it yet but l’ll give Morbius a go. It’ll be nice to have another superhero comedy to watch other than Deadpool.
I wish he had mentioned the milo dancing thing....i still dont know if thats real and im not watching the movie to find out
Morbius reviews aren’t bad, everyone can agree it was one of the movies of all time. The acting was scripted, the morbius was morbin and the cgi was animated.
You know like a bat
Tight!
When Mike said “It’s Morbin time!” I morbed all over the place and it was so morbin morbing!
So you have a morbie for me
It's MORBING Time
So glad I skipped this it looks awful.
I'm ready to see a Man Bat movie now.
And then he says "It's morbid time!" Sony: 00:43
MORBIUS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE
‘Let’s get morbin’  ‘It’s morbin time!’
Morbius is indeed one of the movies ever.                       I didn't watch it. But I still morbed.
It's Morbin' time!
You missed the part where he says “you wouldn’t like me when I’m morby
superheroes movies are for kids
Subscribing was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
I quite enjoyed the movie. But this is brilliant! 😂😂
"..every scene is a clean slate here" 👌
when we saw him say it's morbin time we are so hyped we though of becoming morbin man and drink blood from blood bank like a chug jug
I loved Morbius so this vid may bring me pain
Super easy, morbiusly an inconvenience
It's morbin' time
Morbius was great. I specially loved the part where Ryan had a cameo and he said "super morbeasy, barely an inconmorbius"
My favorite part is when he said "It's morbin time" and morbed all over those guys!
Event Horizon plz
Petition for Ryan to do an alternate reality version of Morbius Pitch Meeting based off the memes
Get morbed.
Son: I want to see a batman movie Mother: We have a batman movie at home At home:
Ryan you forgot the part where Morbius says “It’s Morbin Time!”
I am sorry, Ryan, but this was not funny at all. I was watching it and felt sure that it was the real pitch meeting.
i liked morbius, idc what u say, it is better then the batman
Those are synonyms 😂😂
Give me 1 morbillion likes.😁
He just MOrb'd the Morbin outtavit.
At least they named the movie correctly. Say it with me. More B.S.
The real reason Dr Michael mornius the great has to drink blood every six hours is because if he doesn't he will morb too hard and morb into oblivion
MORBIN TIME
MORBMEETING
MORBCHAT
This is gonna make at least a morbillion dollars at the box office.
I swore you was going to mention the watch scenes where he said he has 6hrs when the watch was clearly displaying seconds and minutes.
It’s morbin time
why is Jared such a bad actor while being this gorgeous?
My favorite part is not caring about the spoiler warning
What kind of bats have you been looking at  :BATMAN
It's morbin time
Amazing Spider-Man 2
Morbing is TIGHT!
02:44 - Really? Not "fingers crossed..."? 🥺😜
It’s mornin time
Its MORBIN time!!!🦇
I love how after producer guy proposes the vulture idea they both start talking to each other like the roles have been reversed
Hollywood Director: I gotta rewrite the climax of the movie Hollywood Writer: but why? HD: because it’s too easy for the hero to stop the villain HW: so you’re saying it’s Super easy, barely an inconvenience heh heh  HD: yeah that’s not good HW: no but it is HD: no it is not HW: no but it is HD: what how so? HW: why Ryan George of course!  ::HW mimes thug glasses falling on his head:: HD: get out of my office…
It’s morbin time
It’s morbin time
When a 7 minute skit is infinately more entertaining than the actual movie, as well as having almost as much content. I'm not even joking.  Movie franchises need to choke on a dick.
Damn sleeper agents                                   Hmm yea i don't like that
its morbin time
this is what cinema sins was like eh
Honestly, Sony should be ashamed of how sloppily they tried to force connections to the MCU in this movie. The credit scenes with the Vulture truly make no sense for the reasons mentioned in this video, and having an image of Spider-man in the trailer with no intention of having it in the movie (the director didn't even have any say in it) really is false advertising. Some people went to see that movie specifically to see how it connects to Spider-man's story in the MCU, only to find that they were intentionally deceived.
You wouldn't like me when I'm morbin'
It's Morbin time!
Morbius is a crap movie.
I FUCKING LOVE MORBIUS
More BS
I give this Morbius video 4 Draculas out of 5
"Pretty much every scene is a clean slate here" XDDD
lol dang it. “Those are synonyms” got me
I took my pregnant wife to see Morbius and when our son was born he came out speaking perfect English an handed us the cure for cancer he had written in utero. Thank you Morbius for making our baby so morbie and for curing cancer. You make the world a morbie place.
I don’t know what you guys are talking about. When I watched morbius it was probably the movie I had ever seen. His cameo in doctor strange made that the mcu movie ever
Its morbin movie
The fbi guy on the roof part killed me I was thinking the same thing
My favorite part was when he said "IT'S MORBIN TIME!" the whole cinema collapsed
#morbsweep
morbius is the morbiest movie of all the time
Bats are actually pretty cut.
The Lighthouse, when?
Its morbin time😈😈😈
"Those are synonyms." 🤣
i need that panda riding whale shirt
I know that this gonna be a terrible movie to watch but for some reason this video made me want to watch it. Maybe cos it's so bad that it's funny?
How is Leto still getting roles
[Comment Morbed]
It’s morbin time!
Seeing the same comments on every single pitch meeting video is TIGHT
i love this pitch morbin
666,665th subscriber.
Jared Leto is one of the actors of all time
My favorite part was when Morbius said: "What are we, some kinda Morbius?"
"I hope you liked it and if you DIDN'T... know, we have a seperate channel for pitch meetings now" I SEE WHAT HE DID THERE
Someone just walked in and said  'Lets make the greatest Morbius of all time' Everyone clapped that was the entire pitch meeting
The fact that I waited for this for more than 2 years, and ending up disappointed is such a bad shit
Morbius was definitely a movie that exists
its morbin time
The FBI guy had spring shoes come on get with the times springs shoes are a thing 🤣
Wow, wow, wow... What?
Day 57 no Morbius
The plot was trash. I was hoping for something better.
Well, at least Matt Smith's performance was great, even if everything about his character wasn't.
All these hot takes and fully formed opinions from people who didn't even see it... Great.  Hope actual reviewers on IMDb or whatever put in the effort instead of just parroting a joke as if it's theirs.
Its Morbin Pitch Time
You fight Batman long enough you see yourself become the Morbius
the first thing i thought when i watched morbius (2003) is that it definitely did not feel like a film written by an edgy first year film student
I do enjoy how Ryan is having entirely too much fun being an odd duck at the end of these. Then again, he made no allusion to being normal. Go on, king.
Literally the only good think about this movie was the "I'm venom" refrence.  What I hate is that people bash Jared Leto over suicide squad, but honestly am I the only one that thinks that his Joker and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn were literally the only reason that shit was even watchable?
Since Juneteenth, something I knew about all my life but just named a holiday, is happening and Walmart made an ice-cream, can we get a theme? Antwone Fisher (20 year anniversary) John Q  Set It Off Brown Sugar Precious  Anything by Tyler Perry The Color Purple Roots Their Eyes Were Watching God Or Etc?
Let's go do the Morbin'
It’s morbin time
I can't wait for Morbius 2: More BS
Saw this movie as a second date with girlfriend. Was annoyed all the way through
Don't know why people hate this movie so much. It's not that bad
its morbin time!
"What bats have you been looking at?" *Coughs profusely in Rouge the Bat R34*
Great Video as always! I keep thinking myself what they could have accomplished IF they were actually stayed true to the PG18 comic script for all those amazing characters (Venom and Carnage as well) Such a waste potential... Although Deadpool showed the way they keep insisting on that idiotic restriction. It's like you have been giving a Super Car and you are not allowed to run above 30 mph.
Loved this, great video
Well, Jared Leto did something in that movie, that's for sure.
Morbius is the best movie ever
“That’s not what bats are known for but I’m glad you’re excited” Producer Guy is so nice sometimes
*You know what time it is.*
Please do a pitch meeting on Zootopia!
After watching the film unfortunately I imagine this is EXACTLY how it went down.
Hmm, I think I might drink criminal blood to keep a bat six pack.
"There is gonna be Blood everywhere" PG-13 Somebody tell these people that new gen children don't want disnep shit.
Does watching this video instead of the movie count as civic duty?
Final cut is like New Mutants
🏴‍☠
I love this guy's catchphrase,"super easy, barley an inconvenience"
Can u do Moonknight please
They could have gone with the "well these bats just happened to be magic bats by mistake" and that might have made more sense for all the magic stuff they end up doing. Bloody cruel to stuff a load of bats in a perspex tube for weeks with nowhere to perch and nothing to eat. Why are there mercenaries on that ship anyway?
Reacted to this pitch meeting here: https://youtu.be/5oqJBKuTFMg
Morbius pitch meeting:  Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb? Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb Morb.
ITS MORBIN TIME
If Morbius was so bad, why did it make a morbillion dollars? Checkmate Atheists.
This movie had so much potential...such a waste.
Do Predestination... it is the perfect movie for this concept! Super easy for you, barely an inconvenience!
My Favorite scene in the movie was when he drank blood for the first time and said "That's morbilicious"
I love Pitch meeting
"Hes jacked and muscular you know, like a bat" lmaooo
Morbius is the most morbius movie of all time
This will be the closest I come to seeing the movie until it's on fx. It'll probably be on after the 3rd underworld movie.
#MorbiusSweep
This guy got too into furry porn.
Thank you Ryan for sacrificing your money to see this piece of 🗑
Seen it 5 times in the cinema, still trying to piece together the complex multi story masterpiece that leads to Tony Stark charging his suit off pure Morb energy and combo MORBING with Morbius and destroying the multi dimensional threat of total life destroying beings!
"Those are synonyms..."
Morbius is one of the movies of all time.
I enjoyed the movie and the pitch meeting:)
It's morbin time
“Looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model, like a bat.”  You’ve been watching Batman and Robin again, haven’t you? 🤣
Marvel movies are always this half baked and bland.
Milo was like rich as f*** they didn't NEED to kill people, they could legit have a near endless supply of DONATED blood.
Those are synonyms
The big eyes u made make him look scarier lol
It would have been funny if at the start he said “so you have a movie for me?” “No I actually don’t this time but let’s make one anyway.”
It’s morbin time
Its Morbin Time!
7:00 I was waiting at 3 and you never came. 😢
Love it!!! Please do SPEED!
Holy Sh.. lol Pretty much every scene is aclean slate. lol omfg awesome . I felt the same way the entire movie.
I hadn't seen Morbius yet but saw the trailer in a theater
Bats as a species probably are in consistently great shape, with all the flying around all the time
Halo Series please?
I’m watching this instead of watching the movie
how about a pitch meeting for Conan The Barbarian 1982
It's morbing time
Monthbious
It was a great movie I swear.! You’ll have a great time. Watch it. It’s worth it!
Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
When Jared Leto leaves used condoms at the door of Margot Robbie’s trailer, he’s an “artist”. When I do it, I’m “arrested”.
1:13 haha the obligatory six pack transformation, this time from a bat
now i know where batman got so jacked, a bat!
When he said “it’s morbin time” and then morbed and snapped the bad guys neck and saved the day the whole theater went crazy. Definitely one of the movie of all time. Made money at the box office for sure.
its morbin time
2022 featured The Batman and The Bat Man.
I knew this would be killed by lazy writing when morbius's blood disorder was unnamed. Lol like you're spending millions on this movie and couldn't come up with a convincing disease name.
It was a good movie. Just the post credit scenes were cool but confusing lol.
Spot on said the spot that talks now cause reasons! We don't need to understand things in this movie! Well done sir.
Morbius might have worked with a talented lead actor. Or a robot.
I enjoyed This more than the film The actual movie....not so much ☢️🥴😒
This was probably the worst movie I've watched in YEARS
Sounds like dr fauci
EVERY SCENE IS A CLEAN SLATE  Boy, when you're right you're right.
This was the pitch meeting that made history! One morbillion tickets sold?!!!!!
Truly morbius is one of the movies ever made
Morbius is worried he will have to kill people to get real blood to survive. Has he never heard of blood banks?
I'm sad there were no Batman or Man-Bat jokes in there...
Please, please, please, please, do Jupiter Ascending! So much to unpack there. It really deserves it...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShAeafYCqxk
why do they still make movies this bad?
do robocop
4:34 … I remember saying the same exact thing damn it’s dark I can’t see anything in these fight scenes
It wasn't that bad... If we'd seen this 15 years ago we would have loved it. It's just behind its time.
A movie where the hero battles the great and terrible Milo, I'll give it a pass.
Just watched this yesterday, finally decided to go for it despite the criticism. Sometimes critics overreact, fandoms get fired up... That was not the case here. What a terrible movie lol. There's so many obviously bad choices, I don't understand it
its all connected
Blood sounds in the trailer
I enjoyed the movie lol
This looks so terrible. I know I’m going to watch it.
People used to say Jared Leto's Joker was the worst. Well who is talking now?
Poor Jared Leto- he just doesn't recognize a bad script when it's screaming at him with unintelligible dialogue and superfluous action scenes.
I'd love to see a pitch meeting of 47 Ronin! Lots of great stuff to use there. 😁
Sony trying to get to spicy lol they need to calm down Morbius wasn't bad just AGAIN had bad writing
Pitch a disaster movie like “The Core” or “Day After Tomorrow”
Dragonball Z move... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
cant go with logic in any multiverse theory.  man has been around for at least 6000 years.  life much longer than that.  even if there were infinite universes, the odds of you finding one that had millions of years have all the right things happen to have one person be the same with the same name is beyond imagination.  if it resulted in the same people with the same names living similar lives, the heroes and villains should have the same powers/equipment
What if Morbius showed up in Avengers Endgame, put on the Gauntlet and snapped his fingers while saying "It's Morbin Time".
Can you guys STAHP with the thumbnails. They’re really fucking annoying. We get it. It’s been 5 years. The big eyes and shock scare is your thing. Very good. Switch it up now.
Morbius is certainly a movie
The person who wrote Suicide injection line really screwed up the movie. Along with first scene.
I think DC paid Sony to make the MCU look bad in whatever way they can 😅
I just watched Morbius and I am speechless. Best movie of all time! 100/10.
One of the pitch meetings ever made
It takes a whole lot to make both DC and Marvel worst movie so Jared Leto is really talented lol
This meeting alone is way better than the movie
How does fbi guy goes there so fast? Fast and furious!
"okay cool what kinda bats you've been looking at?"  safe to say the Robern Pattinson kind
Now that i saw the movie yeah its not that good but not worst than eternals or black widow ,if it wasn’t for the vulture and venom thing it would have been even better than them
I think I am the only one that actually liked Morbius.
What about a Moon Knight pitch meeting?? 🌙 👀
Good gawd this was brutally spot on
TFW you actually enjoyed Morbius
You good movie bad
Cinnamon
U smell
I watched the pitch meeting, then the movie, now I'm back to watch it again.
It's really sad that such a talented actor end up In bad projects over and over.  Poor guy 💔
Just watched Morbius and sadly it is as bad as reviews say for the most part.  The truly sad thing is I really think there is a good movie in there, it just needed a much better script and probably about 30 more minutes with a complete overhaul of the story.   As it is it's basically a mess with the beginning not even making any sense in the actual film. Not a single character gets any believable growth. The bad guy is only a bad guy because the story needed one so...let's go with his lifelong friend like in ASM2 with Harry and Peter.  So disappointing because a better film could have so easily been made.
THIS IS HILARIOUS!!😆
This pitch meeting is way better than the movie.
"You wont like me when I'm hungry" was a line used by Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in The Incredible Hulk (2008). Granted it was in Spanish.
Bunch of scenes together are TIGHT!
While watching this movie I thought to myself, ‘This Pitch Meeting is gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience’.
Say morbius 5 times faster and it sounds like More Beers
what did not make seance was he kept on saying If he drinks human blood he will lose it something like that .and in prison he drank it got out and then forgot about it that he drank it and was in control now that part of the movie was like wtf why ...what the righters forgot he drank blood loool
Starting to think that Leto suffers from that Different Strokes Curse. Everything he touches goes to hell in a hand-basket.
.
To be fair I don't blame Jared Leto, he's actually a good actor, but he has been given terrible scripts to work with. The movie has some redeeming qualities but it's a cliché story, kinda like venom was. The worst part is them forcing mcu into this. They don't care about the movies, they just want the success and box office of the mcu without putting in the work. Just throw a Marvel logo in the title and that's it.
Where’s Multiverse of a Madness you sarcastic sob
He don’t want to drink human blood 💁🏾‍♂️ So why the hell did you turn yourself into a vampire?? 😂😂😂
i heard Jared Leo is looking to REDEEM himself...
A villain with the same powers as the hero sounds pretty MCU to me
I was thinking when the EMTs left their bag outside with blood in it. Well why would they do that? Because oh that checks out lol
Thanks man, another good laugh. Keep up the good work
Shredded bats is tight
I bet this movie was secretly released in China back in 2019
"So...ya know,he'll be jacked....like a bat!" "Umm, yea what lind of bats have YOU been watching?"  Me: Bat.........MEN?
Moon Knight pitch meeting?
Love how you didn’t even mention the biggest problem: They literally stole the Batman Begins score!!!
Suggestion: Jaws picht meeting would be cool if you decide to do this (probably won't) take your time
Batman and Joker teaming up in a Marvel movie sounds like a great idea, though I'm not sure what the Doctor is up to.
the thing about vulture especially hurts because adrian toomes was huge about family,. he would absolutely be much more interested in being in the same universe as his family more than anything else.
It’s morbin time
I really enjoyed it. 2nd favorite Marvel movie actually!      No, no one paid me to say this this is my OPINION
Where is the "Get off my back about '*X*' " 😓🤔
Those are synonyms Lmfao 😂😂😂😂😂
Morbius is arguably the most movie ever
Secret window pls because its cool its a great movie
Totally need to do Elektra. Just revisited it after years and my god, it's bad.
"Sounds like false advertisement"  "Yeah!  Let's do that!"
Why does Jared Leto's Joker get such a bad rap!? Everyone (and yes I mean everyone especially you) should watch the Mr Sunday Movies video about Jared Leto's Joker, people compare it unfavourably to Heath Ledger's Joker but that isn't fair. Heath Ledger's Joker in Suicide Squad wouldn't work but Jared Leto's Joker in The Dark Knight absolutely would.
Morbius sounds like the name of a sentient blob creature 😂great video, Ryan!
When's the Moon Knight pitch meeting!?!?!?!?
"You won't like me when I'm hungry" - Bruce Banner, "The Incredible Hulk" (2008). It's exactly like the thing from the other thing.
New favourite line from a pitch meeting 'that's kinda like the line from the other thing!'
I took my brother to see this movie and we both fell asleep after the first third of the movie.  So, you kinda explained the parts I missed.
Fantastic
You need to do Bicentennial Man. That movie is absolutely insane.
truly the most movie i've ever seen... deserved the 873.8 morbillion dollars it earned
Wow, it really is one of the movies
Lololol
Morbius: The best movie called morbius
Cheap version of batman
Morbius will never be as cool as Blade.
Sony seriously only has Venom as a crutch.  IF sony makes another PG-13 Venom, I wouldn’t be shocked if it tanked. I may like Venom 1 and 2. But 2 had issues which are reasonable complaints. But the biggest thing is a PG-13 Carnage, Which doesn’t work. The biggest threat to the marvel universe, is made a simple sequel villain who gets offed.   Unless if Sony actually tries, I imagine Disney is going to buy them out, just like what happened with Fox after they released Dark Phoenix.
This movie was the best movie I’ve seen in years! Would highly recommend it!!!!!
“Those are synonyms” LOL the most dead pan delivery ever.
Actually, Morbius knew his assistant would turn.
When I saw that panda riding a whale shirt, I went “Wow wow wow wow. Wow.”
This whole movie was "Barely an Inconvenience!"
Yo, Ryan, how about an oldie? How about “The  Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,” or “North by Northwest”? Oh! Do “12 Angry Men”!
I watched this movie two days ago, and noticed many of the same plot problems lampooned here.  If you look at the principle credits, you'll see that the script writer and director are no-name hacks, who deserve to stay that way.
This is the moment Morbius becomes a movie.
It's sad this gets more views the normal screen rant videos.
speaking of bad movies can we get a pitch meeting for Gods of Egypt
The worst Marvel movie since 2015 Fantastic Four.
That "pg-13" 🤣🤣🤣
Morbius sounds like Mobius, and that makes Morbius sound like a dumb Mobius.
I'm upset Matt Smith had to join the MCU in morbius, I wish he could have done something with Karen as nebula in a guardians movie or something of the like.
Can you pick me up at three fifteen? I’m running a bit late.
It's a bad sign when even the Pitch Meeting for this movie is so forgettable that I keep coming back thinking I'm watching it for the first time. You did everything you could, Ryan. You share none of the blame.
You won't like me when I'm hungry is really the best they had....
The "don't forget to forget the forget button..." part got you a like sir. Well played 👏
I think that flying animals would be pretty jacked if they were humans  Have you seen the size of birds chests?
Maybe Leto should stick to small independent movies where he can ACT instead of just SHOW OFF.
People don't give Mobius enough credit. It is still better than that Last air bender movie which never existed.
This episodes view count is higher than Morbius's.
Maybe morbius should’ve just went and got that experimental bat virus vaccination that’s so popular and shill for the big pharmaceutical companies.😳
I’m VENOM !! …Who tf is venom ???
I can always count on Ryan to make me laugh my ass off. I love these pitch meetings so much! In fact....Pitch meetings are Tight!
I completely forgot about coma girl.
Morbius was really one of the movies ever
Lol he mentioned every hole I noticed during the movie.
I hope this move wins "Most Movie Award" in the oscars
Using bats to make a cure? Are you saying his superpower is Coronavirus?
I haven't seen it, I refuse to see it. Refuse like Jared Leto should have been thrown away like 1 of his used condoms.
"Spoilers ahead" as if anyone is going to actually watch this movie
I feel like you missed a great Kevin Bacon joke when you guys were talking about his nose going up
Has Ryan being looking at rouge the bat again
Do Source Code, Big, Oh God, Firestarter, Beastmaster...
Nando Moura tem razão, esse filme é uma bosta 😅
You clearly didn't see a giant fruit bat, then
Didn’t watch the movie, but so glad I watched this video
Ngl, morbius sounds like an edgy story I’d make when I was 12.
How is vulture meant to have met with morbius when the Dr strange spell sent them all back to their own dimensions
This is the best version of this film.
Literally said to myself in my head "is he going to Kamehameha milo with bats?" Right before hand, Then broke out laughing at what I just witnessed.
make one for CODA, please
No jokes, I genuinely really liked Morbius, it was super fun, kinda disjointed, but very very fun and amazingly shot, and the horror actually got me on some parts, I loved it And the actors did a great job, they seem like they had lots of fun
i like how there's a spoiler warning like anyone cares if it gets spoiled for them
I can't believe the rating for this movie is just 338% when it should be 420%. So underrated
Well he actually said dangerous not deadly.
don't add the spoiler warning ain't nobody watching this
Hearing Producer Guy actually worry about the little girl was just adorable.
Very very funny. Liked. Subscribed. Keep them coming.
"Loose his bat 6 pack" omfg im dying
“What kinda bats have you been looking at?”  I know EXACTLY what kinda bats he’s looking at
99% sure I did a better job with my 8 minute lego comic with Morbius than this entire movie.
Having Spider-Man be in the movie, but as the "bad guy" could have been interesting. POV for the fights would focus on Morbius, and we'd never see Peter Parker's face, or scenes of Peter Parker trying to figure out where to track down Morbius.
Who else is watching this instead of the movie
This makes me want to want the movie…trailer. And that’s it
"those are synonyms" 😂😂😂
who........ asked
"Blood sound effects".............................. I mean, sure.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A BLADE Easter egg would have been more on point...
Imagine how much better movies would be if scripts/story boards got run through the satirical wringer BEFORE millions were spent instead of after.
Ka Me Ha Me Bat 😂
this is live footage from sony studios
"super-powered, upward noses are tight!" Hahaha!
I’ve been thinking that maybe the reason why guys like avi arad and tom rothman green lighting Morbius maybe because they’re so obsessed to see the hater sufferers.
Vampirism is a great theme for a comic book movie, because they are soulless, energy draining and won't ever die due to a steady supply of virgins congregating in the dark.
Moonraker please! Saw it on Amazon Prime as Amazon bought MGM and it makes no sense! Opening scene has an Oribiter on the back of a modified 747 and two guys sneak out of their closets and launch the orbiter but without the big fuel tank and solid rocket boosters!
you didn't honk... you promised you'd honk... 😢
I enjoyed Morbius, but I entered the theater expecting it to be bad. My expectations were met to great comedic effect.   It's one of those comicbook movies where you need to turn off your brain and enjoy the transition from scene to scene, whilst ignoring the bad cgi, large gaping plot holes, and predictable plot twists. It actually reminded me of Venom and Black Panther in those regards.
This movie sounds stupid!  I can’t believe it’s sold a morbillion tickets with 1000% on rotten tomatoes
I appreciate how you never make fun of the character or the source comics because it could have been a cool movie with Spidey and blood, and instead you make fun of every stupid decision Sony made.
Producer Guy: “Super-powered upward noses are TIGHT”  Every Karen Ever: “Hold my beer”
It was good and bad at the same time
Do pitch meetings for pitch black and the Riddicks
finally I can subscribe  to pitch meeting!
Venom 2 & Morbius Pitch meeting: He is going to kill everyone there is going to be blood everywhere
I really wanted this to be good, but it just came off as mediocre at best.  Some things just didn't make sense but the movie needed to keep going
Can you do pitch meetings for Netflix Shows and/or movies? 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
When he said, "it's Morbin time!" I came a bit, great movie, I give it a 10/10!
Is it just me or is Morbius basically the same character as the batman from justice league gods and monsters their origin is basically the same
I wonder how many subscribers screenrant lost when Pitch meetings move to this channel?
"What kinda bats you been lookin at?"  LOL..... Thanks to this 'pitch meeting' I have ZERO urge to pay to see this travesty.
Do predestination
Love Pitch Meeting!   Soooooooooooooooooooooo funny every time!!!!!
"Like a Calvin Klein underwear model" while referencing Jared Leto.  That felt intentional.
Daniel Mendoza I know you are watching these clips while trying to avoid being on clubhouse.
"Those are synonyms"
I thought the black cop was blade when he got to the roof so fast. I mean wtf was sony thinking in that scene! Also this would have been the perfect movie to introduce blade!
I can't believe Leto put his name at the top of the poster like he's a star or something...lol. Brah....you're not Harrison Ford or whatever. Your music fills me with despair and loathing by the way....
OMG  IT HAS ITS OWN CHANNEL
"What kind of bats have you been looking at, though?" Batmans, of course
Do Splice!
Morbius was a perfect movie; you're just nuts.
Marvel Legend He is not venom
My favorite part was when Morbius shouted “it’s morbin’ time!” And morbed all over those guys.
Glad you've moved away from screen rant. I immediately unsubscribed when you made this channel 😊
Do a Dune one!
But were they chinese bats?......  .....  From a wetmarket?
MORBIUS SWEEP!!!
Pitch Meeting is often of better-quality storytelling than the actual movies they make fun of.
I feel bad for Jared Leto. He just can’t seem to choose the correct franchises to join😂
A vampire movie A PG13 vampire movie how is that supposed to work?
I feel I owe Pitch Meeting  for all of the movies I never waste money to see.
Well... Batman is a pretty jacked up bat. Maybe he was looking at Christian Bale
Officially more people have seen the pitch for this movie than have seen the movie itself.
"Superpower upward noses are TIGHT!" 😂
Literally the movie. Good job
he is a marvel legend, not venom btw
That Ryan guy at the end looks just like one of the guys during the pitch.
Good job :)
Morbius Was the morbsters who morbzed on the morbbed
repeating the same joke in the comment section is TIGHT
Ryan, you should do a pitch meeting about the sonyverse. Like "We gotta milk our Spiderman licence, what character do we have ? El Muerto ? Fantastic"
Watching Ryan sarcastically back hand cash grabs is tight 😉
Bat six-pack
TLDW: Watch Sonic 2 instead.
Funny how they switched the nose to point up instead of hook down in morbius, huh?
why cant you be incognito in a dinner/restaurant? do you have anny idee in how manny movies semi secret things are beeing disgused in a dinner/restaurant. and why wouldnt there be alien tech in this universe? you dont know if there is or isnt.
Gotta love the YT algorithm. While watching this pitch meeting. the YT Moves Channel announced the chance to pre-order the movie. Still not interested, though.
“Ok cool, what kind of bats have you been looking at?”
I thought that was Keanu on that thumbnail for a split second.
man, Disney should buy sony and stop this madness.
My favourite part is when Morbius says "IT'S MORBIN' TIME!" and then kills all of the nazis and uses his powers to raise them from the dead and he uses his undead army to build a statue out of solid blood and then renames earth to Morbia. That's why we sold over a trillion tickets.
#MorbiusSweep
Wait, does this channel mean I can finally unsub from Screen Rant? Edit: Screen Rant still has all the old pitch meetings. 😔
I love how Leto says he has to act insane and be awful to his coworkers while method “acting” to get his “best” performance and then he’s consistently the worst part of awful movies
Can we get this Man a million subs by end of summer??
Who's watching this before watching the actual movie!
This content kept screen rant alive. Screen rant is a dead channel
Wayt has morbius fought blade before?
Jared Leto is 0 for 2 on comic movies. Give this man a Disney plus series
You said I could recommend a pitch… so I beg for a second time… PLEASE do final destination..it’s ALL TIGHT! I’m laughing at the thought!
Why do we keep getting excited for deez new Sony movies when they suck every time. Maybe it's just my opinion idk.
LIKE A BAT!
This made it kinda seem like it had a plot
I LIKED Jared Leto in Morbius. Basically I thought all the performances were good and the script was pure shite.
*You always keep referencing stuff from previous scenes 😂😂*
Wasn't expecting a lot from this movie, but it was decent I guess.
Sorry Jared Leto, but your carrier already peaked with "Requiem for a Dream"
Just realized we never knew abt coma girl again
In before Morbillion views.
I'm still waiting for you to pick me up man.I missed my flight already,but I'm sure I can rebook it when we get there.
I thought Leto was pretty good in this movie. The movie itself was kinda weak.
This movie is even more evil as it lead to the delaying of into the spiderverse 2
It’s been to weeks he hasn’t shown up yet he said he’d be here at 3?
PLEASE DO "MEMENTO"
"He has a six-pack, like a bat"  "What sort of bats have you been looking at?"  Well. . . Batman.
OMG I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THE SICK LITTLE GIRL..!? What happened to her!?
Is this guy Gottfried’s SON??
i guess sim the.only person that liked this movie
I would like to see some old-old-school pitch meetings.  Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane.  Or like one of the James Bond movies with Roger Moore.
so morbious is from tobey's timeline ? cause that's tobey's spiderman poster.
Lmao the post credit scene really was terrible. Nonsensical crossover and nonsensical Vulture wings. I really hope Sony will pretend like Morbius never happened.
I finally saw this movie at long last. Personally I actually really enjoyed it. I mean it was great and could’ve been a lot better as some parts felt rushed but I still enjoyed it overall. Definitely a unique concept.
Holy sh*t this guy literally read my mind about everything that was wrong with this movie when I saw it this week.
What did Jared Leto do?
Honestly, Morbius wasn't bad.  It just was.  Also I haven't seen such a passive female lead in a loooooong time.
The only great thing about morbius for Jared Leto is people are gonna forget about his Joker performance and roast this one.
how marvel will cancel itself
Funny enough, seeing the word MUDERER written over a picture of Spider-Man could definitely be seen as foreshadowing for Morbius wanting to be a Hero, painted as a Villain
Looks like absolute dogshit. Glad that I will never watch it. nor will I watch pretty much any contemporary hollywood anti-White garbage. But that is just like my opinion, man.
It’s morbin time
I really liked the part where Morbius went MorbMode and kissed Shadow the Hedgehog.
Jared Leto apparently stopped reading the scripts for movies he stars in. I bet he’s pitched the movie, minus it’s flaws, and he agrees this way. His movies are entertainment poison
Oof I didn't watch that movie but not a fan
Didn't see this movie. Never plan to see it. The pitch meeting was sooo much more entertaining than the movie could possibly ever have been.
"To bats, this is lethal. To humans, it's deadly." That's the dumbest line I've ever heard.
I remember with Spider-Man when it was supposed to come out shortly after 9/11 that the studio decided to edit out a scene of Spider-Man saving a plane by creating a huge spider net between the twin towers.  This movie comes out shortly after a a world wide pandemic wiped millions off the planet and disrupting daily life for the last 2 years because of potentially sketchy scientific experiments being conducted on bats.  Am I the only one who thinks that movie studios have lost their ability to read a room?
Sony’s most consistent product is producing the shotgun they keep using to shoot them selves in the feet. Catch up with the the times damnit
*Morbius:* I'm Venom! *Victim:* You're not Venom, I saw him last year dancing at a gay-pride rave.
I hope SOMEBODY watches this, hears a car honk randomly outside at the end of the video...and for a moment asked themselves... "Is Ryan outside?!"
My favourite thing is that they need to drink blood. The artificial stuff is blue, the real stuff is red. They already have a bunch of real blood at the lab. I have no idea why they kept having to kill people. Not even a throwaway line about how the blood has to be fresh.
Watched the film 'Noah'  the other day. Yeah, I know, I know... However it is absolutely prime for a pitch meeting!! It would be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I was actually going to see this movie and I am SO glad I watched this. Sony just needs to lose their rights to the Spider-Man franchise and sell them to Disney already.
The scene at the beginning of the move (the bat cave) also had no bearing on the rest of the film.
Congrats on having your own channel, love these vids and hope you get to reap all the benefits for your work now that your not tied down to SR.
Wait a minute, that synthetic blood plot point is ripping off Blade.
pitch meeting was my only channel I subscribed to for about three days.  if they can stop doing those ten second bullshit cut videos I would subscribe again.  lol
Nityananda!
*Like a bat!*
This was spot on!!!!
Ok to be clear, did anyone who's watching this see the movie... cause I sure as fuck didn't.
Ok these Sony movies are a Trainwreck but remember the people involved in Into the Spider-Verse, their superpower is making terrible ideas into great movies.
awesome new channel sir
This was Paul Allen's batman
Pitch Meetings have their own channel- good news for us, bad new for Screen Rant.
I may not like the morbius movie, but this, does bring a smile to my face
Glad to see that you moved on from Screen Rant and have your own channel
why are most modern movies so bad?
But does he drink a forty in a death basket?
7:02 I waited in the middle of the road for 12 days bro! My feet are FREEZING! I kept getting into anyone's car that HoNKed! And let me tell you, they were NOT happy! I assume it's because they realized they're not Ryan George but that's their problem!
I'm glad someone did a proper breakdown as to why it was such a shit movie
If I ever were to venture into filmmaking, I would use these pitch meetings to help with “what not to do” 😂
LIKE A BAT! XD
" Superpowered upward noses are tight" LMAOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When I watch these for movies I've not seen, I often wonder if the movie comes off as bad as it seems to in the pitch meeting.
"Spoilers for morbius"  Oh no! Anyway,
If there's vampire I'm sure blood will get involved, blood and PG just doesn't mix
what kind of bat are you looking at though?   George: Bat...man
It's MORBIN TIME
I bet Kevin Feige is losing his mind with how Sony is making PG13 movies out of more hardcore characters and since he is a comic fan must have lost his shit when Venom ate Carnage, Jesus even “family friendly” all knowing and all powerful Mikey Mouse is allowing Ryan Reynolds to make DP3 R-Rated. The ratings alone are why no promotional content has made me want to see anything past VENOM 1
Lmfao 🤣 this is perfect
Who else watched this instead of the actual movie?
So i saw "Everything, Everywhere, All at once" the other day, might be a good one for Pitch Meeting :)
one time I hit a bat flying around the house and when I went to pick it up to throw outside it had a boner. Was like 1/3 of its body length. insane. makes you wonder about this version of batman
i havent watched morbiuss but im still watching this vid cuz morbius is so terrible idgaf
wow, I did not realize how many plot holes this movie has my first time watching it
So Marvel's still doing the thing where the bad guy is like the good guy, but bad, huh.
Why doesn't he just drink donated blood?
This is god damn epically hilarious
ENOUGH!!!😂😂😂
Does anyone else feel that excessively large photoshopped eyes in thumbnails is getting a bit old?
Oh this is just The Doctor and Amy in Venice all over again
cant wait for morbius 2: More bius
Is it me or is Jared Leto a highly overrated actor?  What is he good in?  I understand some of the movies he in are good but not due to his contributions.
Jared Leto definitely redeemed himself by making the most movie ever.
If you ignore the end credits it's not that bad. The movie seems to imply that Morbius has lost control to the bloodlust at the end.... i think....
this is the most video made for a movie of all time
'Spoiler Warning!'  Yeah, I'm not going to be watching this.
lol what a mess!
Ryan George: “Oh yeah so now instead of being all sick and thin he’s jacked and muscular you know like a bat.” His boss: “That’s not really what bats are known for but I’m glad you’re excited.”   That part already got me 🤣
So many pitch meetings and so many plot holes he can't even say "press the buttons" straight
😂 😂 😂 😂
Yeah let's do some of that...
Watching this instead of the actual movie >>>>>
What kind of bats have you been looking at…? 🤨  And Vulture was already from that universe; he fought Tom Holland Spiderman. He wouldn’t be sent “back” to the Sony universe cause he was never from there. Absolutely nothing with the vulture scenes makes any sense
I'm sure glad i didn't watch it
This movie is so bad that it makes Dracula 2000 seem watchable!🤣
Charlie's Angel's 2020
Ryan, how about a Pitch Meeting about "Moonfall"?   Just watched this guilty pleasure, and I think it's a perfect B-movie candidate for a Pitch Meeting.  And the nanobots can be compared to the microbots in "Big Hero 6".  Hope to see you take it on!
It’s one of the worst movies I saw in the last 10 years.  How can you make vampires boring? Seriously?!
Coz the movie needs the bad guy now. Make sense . Now that is the thing I agree with the producer guy
Pitch Meetings are off of Screen Rant and I couldn't be happier <3
Can’t help but notice you use the same jokes every time … if you can call them jokes
Bats actually have really strong muscles that give them the capacity for flight. if a human had muscles capable of metabolism like a bat, they would be strong on super human levels
Pitch: We are going to sell 1 trillion tickets, reset the culture, and SWEEP Suit: Say no more
The worse the movie the funnier the pitch meeting 😂😂
I understand it must have been difficult to try to parody the greatest movie of all time, Morbius. I appreciate the effort Ryan, even though all the hate you are receiving for this is completely justified.
For once super easy barely and inconvenience makes sense bc that fight seemed way too easy
"What kind of bats have you been watching?" I could give you a list.....most of it is +18
Best movie ever!!!
Blade would have made so much more sense in the post credit scene
Please please please PLEASE do a RoboCop (1987) Pitch Meeting. Best movie ever made. Haha.
You know, now I pity Jared Leto for starring in a bad superhero movie character TWICE.
This is spot on! Great summary of its many plot issues... That being said, I really enjoyed the movie, the effects looked great and I was able to follow the last fight no problem (and I have miopia and didn't bring my glasses) What I mean is, this is great entertainment, and great for checking another point of view but it's not all, and the movie manages to create good suspense and (in my opinion) action scenes.
PLEASE YOU NEED TO DO HOUSE OF ANUBIS!!!!!!!! Like/comment if you remember the show. Watching clips now the acting was SOOOO horrible!
😀 you make me a better person..I literally pick apart everything I watch. HBO max Justice League Injustice def needs a Pitch Meeting. Thanks for all the amazing content!!
Don’t forget the “ oh and we’re going to be supposed to route for morbious throughout the movie yet in the end they switch and he now evil joining bad guys cos he’s bad in comics and that needs to come in somewhere “
Really the funniest part was—  WHERES THE FREE GUY PITCH MEETING ?!?!?!  Please.
I forgot to forget the Forget button
sadly this was just one of the worst movies in my opinion that i have seen and why call him micheal and not like mikael like european has a much better ring to it for a vampire
I haven't seen the movie. I looked it up. That post credit scene is real.         I'm not watching the movie.
You get a clean slate every scene 😂
“I hope she pulls through” “Me too” For some reason this has the same passive aggressive energy as a southern lady saying “bless your heart”
How many Spiderverse movies are we gonna get?? As far as I'm aware we're getting 4 so far, which is insane  I loved the original Spiderverse comic, it was one of the best comics I've ever read. But we are oversaturating THE HELL out of it, the worst part is that NONE of them are actually based off the actual story
It had a couple plot holes (you didn't even mention how/why he got arrested at all) but I was expecting Carnage levels of nonsense and it was nowhere near that level. I probably had more fun than I did at The Batman
Can you please do Dune!!!
Somewhere there is a vampire rat floatin around that was forgotten about 😁
The writer is a furry: confirmed
Thanks for watching it so I don't have to
Pitcher guy: You won't like me when I'm hungry Director guy: Hey that's kind of like that line from the other thing Pitcher guy: It sure is sir kinda Director guy: WOW WOW WOW, wow this meetings going better than I thought.
I really wanted this movie to be good. Huge disappointment personally
Ryan... You said you would pick me up but I've been waiting for days. Where the fuck are you!? It's cold and I almost have no cellphone battery left.  Come now, as soon as possible, or I'll never see you again!
"What kind of bat pictures are you looking at?"  Pictures of Man Bat from Batman, maybe?
Sony ruining MCU
“What kind of bats you been lookin at?” 🤣
It had potential…. to be better than bad.
To see the real ratings, you need to check the audience score.    This was way better than No Way Home, it actually has interesting funny scenes instead of cameo cash grab.
You should do one for monty python and the holy grail. Its an old one, but one of my all time favorites
Could you please make a pitch meeting for this Van Hellsing movie with Richard Roxburgh and Hugh Jackman?
“You know…like a bat.”  “…what kinda bats you been looking at though?”  😂 💀
Don't forget, Jaret Leto is a *REAL CULT LEADER!* People should be freaking out over this. DC is allowing known Cult Leaders get acting roles, that they can use to spread there influence to others!
Morbius should have been called COVID Man! With the power to make anyone he wants, suffer a sudden coughing fit! However, he can never wear a mask, because it would remove his COVID-spreading powers! Oh, and he ALSO needs to cough on people in order to *SURVIVE!*      (Note: No offence is meant by this post. Bats may not be behind COVID. Wear a mask and get vaccinated, please!)
"So you have a movie for me?" "No sir I don't"
Do '"Passengers"
i had no idea that this movie was made by sony, so I was confused how a marvel movie could be so bad.
Pitch guy: He's jacked, and muscular you know, like a bat. Studio guy: That's not really what bats are known for, but I'm glad you're excited. Pitch guy: Dude's freaking shredded now, he's got like a 6-pack - looks like a Calvin Klein underwear model you know, like a bat. Studio guy: Ok, Cool! What kind of bats you've been looking at though?  XD lol!!!
LMAOO!! You guys never disappoint! Everything said here is what I was thinking in the theater! Hilarious! Also, that fight scene at the end was the worst and most illogical scene I've ever seen. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Matt Smith (which is also a super biased opinion in my POV because I love Matt in Dr Who and he's an amazing actor). Jared Leto is a great actor too but he did not show that in this movie.
Im more excited for this video than the movie itself.
I had to resubscribe, or is this a new channel?
Morbius is a movie I guess
Please do the Rocky Franchise ❤️🙏
I haven’t seen this movie but…with vampires, and Batman, and…Covid, our obsession with bats is 🦇💩 crazy.
This movie sounds like a choatic mess, i love it
Manbat sucked, Batman didn’t even make a single appearance in this. I don’t recommend it
Poor Jared Leto. I believe he is a good actor! He has just so much bad luck when it comes to picking action movies to play in.
To be fair, Morbius started as a Spider-Man villain.
When the writer got asked if he got a movie for the executive he should've answered "well..."
How are you not at 1 million subscribers yet?! Screen Rant blows, you were the only reason that I subscribed to that channel.
Doctor Who wtf? Oh, Matt....
This is definitely one of the movies honestly.
"To bats its lethal. To humans its deadly." So are bullets
THATS KINDA LIKE THE LINE FROM THE OTHER THING
cars
Pitch meeting for Prince of Persia and the sands of time please
"You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry."
I feel like I have to see this movie just to be sure you were honest about that Vulture stuff...
One week and still waiting for the hunk 😂
"So Vulture comes to the hospital? Or does he just find Morbius somewhere downtown?" "No, Morbius is going to drive way out into the wilderness to meet him." "Well, why would he do that?" "I don't know!"
Please do one for Our Flag Means Death
Do sonic the hedgehog two
A dedicated channel...cool!  Look...they are COMIC BOOK MOVIES. They are not great art...they don't have to make sense or plumb the depths of whatever. Just sit in the dark, eat your popcorn and enjoy the flashing images.  That's what I do, anyway.  I liked the first part of this movie...Jared Leto is a fine actor despite his casting missteps, and I really bought him as a sick, suffering maverick doctor willing to take some big risks to advance a cure [Matt Smith, also great at being sick and suffering]. However my interest kind of dropped off when they became CGI-powered monsters. Maybe I'm getting too old for comic book movies [pushing 70...]. One of the things I REALLY dislike is the MCU's work to force you to see _every_ MCU movie and read every comic to understand what's going on with their stories. The Michael Keaton/Vulture thing was completely wasted on me, and I kind of resent it.
You should do pitch meetings for Luca Toy story 2 Back to the future 2 The lego Batman movie and Jaws.
You HAVE to do Everything Everywhere All At Once. It’s the best movie I’ve ever seen
Please do "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "Meet Joe Black" those would be amazing!
I didn’t think it was bad- but it was very jumpy- and the mcu connection felt rushed and a bit sloppy. But at least it sets up potential Andrew Garfield vs sinister six
Half the trailer scenes are not I the movie lol
1:22 the bat his been looking at is batman
Finally saw the movie. Time to watch the pitch meeting
I think you should do one for Hallmark movies.
If i have to say this pitch meetings makes more money Than Morbius
Sony i demand a reshoot of Morbius but  Ryan george plays all the characters  I guarantee that will make money
0:50  Bad and False Advertising is basically what this movie is
"What photos of bats have you been looking at"!?? 🗡️👌🏾😂🤪
I thought letto will come back with this. But my god it’s worse than suicide squad 😹😿
Well, the "ripped" actually makes sense - vampire bats can't build up body fat, which also is why they can starve very quickly and can't jump meals.  So, assuming that a vampire bat got the same wax job that Jared Leto got ... "I guess that's a thing that could happen."
Morbius is one of the movies ever made
I wonder if they'll 'fix' any of this by the time it's hit digital release? Extended Edition, Director's Cut, Definitive Edition ... any of those seem like they'd be an improvement.
3 was hours ago! WHERE ARE YOU?
“What kinds of bats have you been looking at” I bet he looked at bats on e621
More people saw this video than saw the actual movie.
Best. Outro. Ever.
So it's kinda like EA Sports when they say "if it's in the game, it's in the game", there's a ton of stuff not actually in the game?
So I'm thinking of skipping this movie but before I decide how was matt Smith's character
500 morbillion tickets guys
Executive guy writing the post-credit scenes makes so much sense, those really felt written on the rush by some executive guy.
Idk why that movie is so disliked.. I watched it 632 times with my eyelids stapled open, because I didn't want to miss a blink of this, this.. masterpiece! No doubt this movie will make AT LEAST 800 trillion dollars world wide.
Why is there no A-team pitch meeting?,!!
I'm excited for how the Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe (PMCU) is going forward. It's gotten its own channel and now maybe Studio Guy will get a computer monitor on his desk from this current decade! Such excite, many like.
Do speed plz
sony really is the the little brother trying to play with their big brother's toys and failing completely
Thanks Ryan!!  These are all so hilarious and the Morbius meeting is another gem!  Having been in pitch meetings these bits are often cutting close to the truth!  Wow-Wow-Wow..... Wow!
"There's going to be blood everywhere" "PG-13" "There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere"  I almost thought it was a Disney produced movie, but then I realized it would be good if it was.
You forgot when he said "It's morbin' time!" That was really cool 😎
I just wanted to say how much I saw that this movie was going to be as bad as the first suicide squad movie and that wasn't good enough to save will smith's career....but they all deserve to work real jobs anyway.
Sony is ass at making these Marvel movies, FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sony owns all the spidermen besides half of Peter parker
This Pitch Meeting is more of Morbius than I will ever watch.
I love this so much ... and I like the movie Morbius, too.  Please, please do a pitch meeting for Passengers? Because there is such a mix of good stuff ( _the acting, the set, the way the dilemma is set up, some of the effects, Jim's slow descend into depression_ ) mixed in with the bad ( _much better movie with a different POV character, and what a lucky coincidence that the one female passenger that Jim feels this deep soulful connection with is also hot AF_ ) - it makes for a perfect pitch meeting.
Please! Do the Adam Project!
You cant show me Matt Smith and expect me to now say Geronimoooo!
Screen Writer Guy and Producer Guy really worked hand to hand to produce this corporate crap.  Nice to see their relation evolving this way
I enjoyed the movie. I don't know why it was considered bad
I can finally subscribe to your Pitch meetings without having notifications for the shit screen rant does.
Very entertaining! If you're searching for movies to make pitch meetings about: Underworld (2003) and its pre/sequels would kinda fit to Morbius. And besites that I'd suggest Knight and Day (2010)
I loved this movie
Did the vulture thing really happen???
GUYS GUYS GUYS!!!!!   I have a pitch for you.  I know it's not a movie, butttt........... CNN+      Biggest bust ever.    They projected 1,000,000 viewers the first year.  So far they have a grand total of 10,000.
Madmax Fury Road pitch meeting please
I had to rewatch to hear Writer Guy say, "Alright, Eddie way" when the Venom thing came up! Classic!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSE DO EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE!
I saw it, immediately thought of Ryan's video on being a Marvel writer when he talked about the main nemesis being the good guy.. but bad
"Those are synonyms."  Hahaha
favorite part is when morbius said “i am morb” then he morbed into morbius
MORBIUS SWEEP 2087
Can we have Moonfall next please? It's hilarious, and also quite entertaining...
Ooh, new channel! Subscribe? Don’t mind if I do!
The movie was already pretty bad but the post credit scenes were just a mountain of incompetence. It doesn't even begin to make sense. They're just running on full autopilot with no idea of what they're doing anymore.
so tropic thunderr
"that's not really what bats are known for but I'm glad you're excited" my fav part
Sony’s just jealous that they aren’t part of the MCU and aren’t getting that sweet sweet box office money
1:27 Batman of course. Noob.
“To bats those are lethal, to humans those are deadly” “Those are synonyms”  Synonyms in movies are tight!
I think “Waiting” would be a fun one
Sony, “Why don’t these idiots love our movies?!”
You should really do a pitch meeting for Shawshank redemption if you haven't already
“What kind of bats you been looking at?” - that one cracked me up
Watching these are Super easy Barley an  Inconvenience
Doctor who pitch meeting please
When I saw that movie the first thing I thought of was "pitch meeting for this one is gonna be TIGHT"
Easily the movie ever made 😬👌🦇
Film isn't great. But def doesn't deserve the hate it is getting.  As for how Andrian got the vulture suit back - you could assume he stole / got it from Oscorp in the Garfield Universe. We don't know what incarnation of Spiderman inhabits that universe.   Just a theory.
Morbius is awesome. Haters gonna hate
Pitch meeting “let’s use the man who ruined the DC universe as our main character” ends of Sonys use of the marvel name……………..
Need to do cowboys and aliens...
Once again Sony annoying me! Where are the No Way Home deleted scenes?
please can you do the first predator movie. love your videos
"What kind of bats u been lookin at"  "Batman"
"spoilers ahead!"  yeah no one cares for this one chief lmfao
Tbh. I don't think it's that bad. A lot of problems listed out here is in other 'good' marvel movies as well. (eg. Spider man becomes buff, Dr strange magic doesn't make sense in no way home as well, ) . Sure its not perfect, and I rather not have the mcu relations in the movie at all but it's pretty enjoyable.
“Those are synonyms” 😂😂😂
I love when writer Ryan doesn’t know the answers 😂😂😂😂
Can you do a pitch meeting about the show Teen wolf?
Ryan do you think you can do ghost rider spirit of vengeance
what kind of bats you been looking at though >_> FA o_o the normal kind
Vox Machina would be a good one
Would've been better if Milo was more cynical and didn't care about human life because people always treated him badly throughout his life. But it's odd that he instantly became a killer because he's really rich and only seemed to have been bullied once.  🤔
Secret Window with Johnny Depp
"There's going to be blood everywhere."  'PG13!' "There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere."  'Nice!' lol
"KInda feels like false advertising."  'Yeah lets do some of that. That sounds great.'  lol. Hilarious
People can do spoilers all they want about Morbius, but I'll get pissed if they spoil my Pitch Meeting video
There needs to be a "the sandlot" and then a "the sandlot 2" pitch meeting.
We need one for idiocracy.
very glad I didn't go pay to see what sounds like an absolute clusterduck of a film
1:30 “the Robert Pattinson type.”
After seeing this, what immediately came to my mind was the game "Darkwatch," which basically did this similar plot setup but a whole lot better.  You were an outlaw in the Wild West who tried to rob a train and ended up releasing a vampire and getting infected by its curse.  The rest of the game was centered around you making good or bad choices that granted you special respective powers for both sides, but ultimately resulted in you either completely succumbing to the curse, or managing to free your soul of it and redeem yourself.
I like how they are always so welcoming and supportive in these pitch meetings, the movies must be really good
#MorbiusSweep
Morbius: Venom 3.
It's not Morbius, it's the covid-19 origin story 😏
I'll never understand why Sony insist on using the most lethal, spider-man adjascent anti-heroes to make nothing but PG-13 movies.
Quality-wise, I feel Morbius was somewhere between Venom 1 & 2.  If it were just a stand-alone movie, it would have been fine.  It was the blatant lies (false advertising, as Ryan addressed here) of the trailer that led the audience toward expectations Sony clearly never intended to deliver on that made it a miserable experience.
Algorithm.
This movie was such a movie it actually was one of the movies playing in theaters
ManBat
I AM MORBING
MORB
I LOVE MORBIYS
4:07-4:15 I literally had to pause the video after this so I could have a good laugh. I’m dead.
Algorithm
Please make pitch meeting on Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore I know that the movie isn't released yet in your country but when it does please make it as soon as possible btw Love from India really big fan of you and your work.
Do Beetlejuice!  I've always loved that movie ever since I saw it in the theatre when it came out.  I watched it recently and was surprised at the number of things in the script that didn't make much sense.  It would be nice to have those things cleared up!
Do u guys notice a difference from the older episodes? Hes getting stronger
LMMFAO
Morbius is a mess.
Omg I loved this. Glad to know I didn't have to waste time buying a ticket and watching this foolishness
Still need a Battlefield Earth pitch meeting.
I’d love to see a Princess Bride pitch meeting.
This might be the first time i watch a Pitch Meeting before seeing the movie
It's a shame that Jared little was too small to fit on the camera
“It doesn’t matter”  Was the life of this movie
I guess this is how the pitch meeting went 🙌
In comics morbius is a vampire 24/7  but we have jared leto... We want to show him of. But sir he is a vampire. But make him a buff human vampire that doesnt have to be a vampire all the time ..
Ryan it’s three
That post credit scene was fucking dumb
Drop a like if you say "barely an inconvenience" out loud every time.
I thought Jordan Catalano wasn't going to be able to ruin anymore movies but his blowjob abilities simply can't be resisted by any producer.
A pitch meeting for Despicable Me?
0:01 spoilers if you care, which i doubt anybody would!
I can't express how disappointed I am with everything I just heard from this. I actually like Morbius and was looking forward to a live-action Spider-Man vs Morbius movie when I heard this was being made and they went the anti-hero route. Again. Do they realize they can make a movie with the villain as the main character and have the bad guy win in the end? Without putting in any redeeming traits or feats just make an evil villain that gets their own movie and win. That would do so much in terms of making villains appear more threatening and imposing.
Wait. He's got a point. How the hell would Morbius, and the people of New York who Venom is?
Wow......... hearing a huge undercurrent of sexual abuse claims against Leto lately............ even James Gunn is saying it...............
Is this a True Blood spin off?
What are the chances of two friends having the same RARE blood disease?
IDK why but "those are synonyms" had me rolling
Such a joke of a movie 💀
I know it’s a little “mature” for a lot of the pitches done by this channel but I’d love to see a Game of Thrones pitch meeting for the seasons. And watch you rip it apart near the end! Hahah
*what the actual fuck*
Please do Tank Girl.
“That’s not really what bats are known for, but I’m glad you’re excited.”😂😂
Here at 788,997 views.
How many of you mistook him for John wick in the thumbnail
jus' sayin'. there.s a new true facts out.
I don't understand all the criticism, this movie sold 1 trillion tickets!!!! and is by far one of the movies of all time.
Ryan, why haven’t you done SNAKES ON A PLANE???😂
it took marvel a decade to build up a good cinematic universe, one good movie after another (some bad ones, its not perfect), trying to keep the continuity and trying to keep the characters real. it took Sony one movie . . . ONE to ruin all that. this is why we cant have nice things.
Can you please make a pitch meeting on one of these movies listed below?  Pineapple Express (2008) Fight club (1999) Ghost Rider (2007) Man-Thing (2005) Or Road House (1989)  BTW I love all of these movies and your pitches! 🤣 - thanks!
You should do the movie 2012
paranormal activity please. Such gold, the budget was soooo low but it booted an entire franchise.
Me: huh, this looks interesting *clicks* ….. Oh hey, i’ve seen this guy on Game Theory!
Please make a pitch meeting for Momento
Love how you call it out!
Synonyms are tight lol
would watch this but i'm running late for my 738th viewing of morbius
Is Milo a Doctor who to... Em Doctor who to ?!.
So, marvel have a monopoly in superheroes so sony will make a monopoly about turning villains into semi-héroes, noise
I think it's time for some BLADE Pitch meetings!
Hey, might be time for Turning Red? For my inner teenage girl?
morbius is the movie ever
I found this channel yesterday and I love it.  Do you have on The Fifth Element?
Instead of being sick and thin, he is now jacked and muscular, you know, like a bat.
Me and my twin sister watch watch this movie twice in one day good movie
Can we get a True Romance pitch meeting??!!
*my nephew wrote a script yall wanna see it?*    *3 years of production*
Didn't see the movie but I feel pretty caught up now.
hi edit didnt watch yet future self
Well I guess Leto kinda redeemed himself from Suicide Squad being his worst role ever. So that worked out
It’s passed 3 and I’m still waiting…never heard a honk
Finally! I don't have to go to screen rant for these
Watching 281 episodes of pitch meeting in one sitting is tight.   Super easy ... Barely an inconvenience.   Wow wow wow, wow.   I decided.   That may as well happen.   Because money.
Of course bats are muscular! Just look at Batman!
Man ok this movie sounded horrible
false advertising
Sony is the EA of movie production
Watching Sony tie-in's to the MCU is TIGHT!!
"So you have a movie for me?" "I mean kinda" " Uhh, what?"
Can you do Ratatouille next?
Damn I freaking love ya!
Yet another edition of Ryan singlehandedly carrying Screen Rant on his back
Question, why couldn’t morbious just collect blood and drink it? You know, like doctors do?
I am so happy Pitch Meeting is on separate channel so I can finally unfollow Screen Rant, because only actually good videos on there were the ones made by Ryan.
I kinda enjoyed the movie actually, and actually liked Leto's Morbius, problem here was the editing and script, I'm guessing it suffered from the same issues "new mutants" had.
Would love to see a Hackers (1995) Pitch Meeting
Sony should stop making Marvel movies, it's CLEAR they don't know to write anything other than boring cliche crap, I would love an Amazing Spider-Man 3 with Andrew Garfield fighting Tom Hardy's Venom but from Sony it would have a 90% chance of sucking...have it in the MCU/made by Disney
"PG 13... There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere." I almost ruined my computer from spitting out my drink.
Why are there mercenaries on the boat?!
Even the guy that's pitching it thinks it's stupid Sony did that post credit scene.
The FBI guy was able to get to the roof so fast because he was fast and furious 😬
I’ve seen it 4 times
Do sonic 2
I feel bad for the Morbius writer. Like….damn.
Morbius is one of the movies of all time!
please do the marvel netflix shows as well
ngl i have one question. couldn't they just adapt morbius's storyline from the spiderman animated series like seriously why sure venom has his own lore so i get that but morbius is an experiment so yea why not spidey 4 it for tom holland
Quisiera saber si alguien leyó el script de esta película antes de hacerla. Morbius es terrible.
Jared Leto possesses a unique talent for adding absolutely nothing to a movie.
I think wrtier Ryan is confusing actual bats with ripped Batfleck from the other universe.
I saw a Hadoken from Street Fighter not Dragon Ball Z lol
"Calling to Dr. Ryan, you are needed in operating room 7 to dissect and dismember the latest big budget movie"
Sounds like the first Venom movie, except it’s bats instead of alien goop. The bad guy is good, the villain gets the same powers as the good guy, and the love interest gets a taste as well...
This sounds boring and confusing.
Hey, how about a pitch meeting for "The Apprentice." Followed by a pitch meeting for the whole fucking Trump administration.
Is a pitch meeting happend about this, the movie wouldn't hapend.
Milo nicest guy ever turned villian
Christ almighty this movie sucked , and not the good kind , poor Matt smith he deserves better
Speaking of Michael Keaton, how about a Pitch Meeting for Beetlejuice?  I love that movie but it makes no sense.  Like why would there be a spell to kill the deceased in the Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Make a pitch meeting for "all of us are dead "
Saw the movie last night.  Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.  Horrible.
1:17 Fun Fact: There are bats that are 1.5 meters tall
Can you do four brothers!? @pitchmeetings
I love how there are spoiler warnings for this pointless plotless trash
Jared Leto just can't catch a break lol
Actually a better movie than this makes out. Solid 3/5. And again it's basically a kids movie
Well💆🏼‍♀️ I hope she pulls through   😂😂
Finally! Someone who ACTUALLY talks about the movie itself, not just the post credit scene!
It felt like every couple pages of the script was written by a different person like the random abandoned plot lines and continuity errors couldn’t have been written by one cohesive writing team right?
#MORBIUSSWEEP can’t believe this movie made a trillion $ at the box office and 150% on rotten tomatoes 🔥
This should have just been some Blade/Spider-Man crossover movie.
The best thing about Pitch Meeting is when a shitty movie is released I don't have to watch it to laugh at it.
I was expecting you to mention the lab mouse that much have the same powers
The picture is terrifying
I feel like Morbius would have been a lot more interesting if Morbius was more villainous throughout the film. Like he should have agreed to cure Milo and actually kind of have consequences that lead him to being the anti-hero he supposed to be.
Love your work ! Never fails to make me laugh  can you do merlin next if you can
That pitch meeting was almost as long as the movie!
I know it’s an old movie, but please do a pitch meeting for “Hook”; I’m sure it’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
"What kind of bats you been looking at?"  "Batman."  Missed opportunity
I'd love to see a pitch for Blood in Blood out
Can you please do a pitch meeting on Birdemic 1 or 2! Its my husband's 21st birthday in 8 days and it would make his day! He doesn't  like celebrating  his birthday but  this would make his whole day!!  I understand if you can't make it in time I know you are only human  and aren't just content.
More people watched this than the actual movie
But you guys wanted Tobey (The dancing emo Parker) to be in the MCU? i kept saying that would affect horrobly the MCU! But no!!!!! You just let Sony get their dirty hands in our MCU!!! Hope you guys are happy now!!!!
"There's gonna be blood everywhere." "PG-13." "There's gonna be blood sound effects everywhere."
Spy kids would be hilarious
just once, "yes, of course it's going to be difficult"
Please do “Death on the Nile”
While the movie feels disjointed at places, I think I enjoyed it for the most part(just saw it today)
Do A Goofy Movie!
Poor Jared Leto is never going to make into a decent superhero movie
Yeah that last scene made no sense with vulture
Attempt 543162 for a James and the Giant Peach pitch meeting 👍
This is my new favorite thing.  Yay me!  I've subscribed!
No the thumbnail is too funny 🤣 😂
For the love of God Stop.making.super.hero.movies
the sonic 2 pitch meeting is going to be interesting.
You can't convince me the post-credit scenes were not written by a kid, even if you give me irrefutable proof.
We need a “Moonfall” pitch meeting.
Between this, Critical Drinker, Angry Joe, and a few others. I really haven't needed to waste my money on suspect movies in nearly two years. Thanks guys!
Morbius is so by the numbers boring that even the Pitch Meeting is painful to watch. That never happened before!
"I'll pick you up at 3" best missed joke 🤣 in the whole video
Moonfall PM please!
The dropped plot part was hilarious, bc wtf. But the difference with Jared Leto as joker, vs Jared Leto as Morbius. There’s a higher chance he’d do better as Morbius in another movie, then him being Joker again
The way he says “you know like a BAT” feels so strangely innocent
*Morbius was definitely one of the movies of all time.*
Fun Fact: Gil Kane the artist who originally drew Morbius got fired from Marvel because supposedly he was stealing other artist's art pages and allegedly selling them for his own gain...
Sonic The Hedgehog 2!
How about simply obtaining blood which has been donated, and then checked for diseases? So, he wouldn't ever have to kill anyone, and he could drink as much blood as he needed.  I guess Hollywood is too fucking stupid to remember that blood banks actually exist. Or that Morbius could simply pay people directly, to donate blood to him, personally. That way, he'd have a constant supply of blood, and the people who supplied that blood would earn lots of money, and they'd be happy to keep donating it on a regular basis.  I will not be watching this retarded pile of steaming bullshit.
Im gonna just say it. Unpopular opinion.. but, I loved this movie. Saw it in the movie theater with my girlfriend. We both really liked it and everyone in the theater seemed to really like it.  Sure, it's easy to pick it apart. But, if this movie had come out 15 years ago when people just went to action movies just to enjoy them, I think it would have been really well received.
I actually enjoyed the movie because it's a solid anti-hero vampire movie (even though it's obviously not perfect) and I'm really hoping for a sequel but I have to admit, this made me laugh a couple of times.
I love that the post credits scene is pitched by the producer to the writer instead of the usual way
Truly one of the best movies.
"I was aghast when I found out it was based on a comic book. This is the truest height of cinema and even I cannot top it. A wise man admits when he is wrong and I was wrong. I apologize to all comic book movies."  -Martin Scorsese on the hit film Morbius  ;)
100% accurate :))) 1 mention though, his girl became a vampire because she bit his lip and swallowed some of his blood...at least that was their logic...i think
Please do a pitch meeting for the movie Wanted. I'd love to see your take on the bending bullets and other crazy nonsense
I had never even heard of this film coming out until now.
I’ve been watching your pitch meetings for years and have wondered why you have never done a rocky horror picture show pitch meeting?
To anyone wondering why the bats fought for Morbius instead of Milo, I think it's because Morbius bonded with them. We're shown in the film that Morbius interacted with the bats, they accepted him, and he probrably spent quite a bit of time with them. So the bats probrably would listen to him rather than this other vampire stranger.
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance Pitch Meeting
About a decade ago I bought my kid a pair of "Hulk Hands" that say things in a "Hulk voice" when you bang them together.  I swear that one of the lines sounded like, "You're making me hungry!"
Why wasnt it uploaded from ryan Jorge?
Called it darkknight rises the joker n a lil marvel wit n fast paced  action sequences. Still liked it though
Please do AMBULANCE!! Total dog shit, you could get 45 minutes of material out of it if you wanted to.
Every scene is a clean slate... There's no better statement to show how poor this movie is.
Definitely need to roast sonic !
Morbius is one of the most movies of all time
I really enjoyed this movie.  Doesn't make the Pitch Meeting any less accurate tho. lol.  The after credits stuff definitely just seemed tacked on and super irrelevant.
Superb
I finally saw it last night. It was definitely entertaining.
🥰🥰🥰🥰💖💘💖💖💘💖💖💘🤓🤓🥰🤓🥰 wow, wow, wow.. -wow! Ahhhhhhhh 🤓🥰🤓💘💘🤓🥰🤓💘💘🤓🥰 I LOVE it!!! Xoxoxoxoxo
Needs fresh blood to survive before and after. Didn't have to kill anyone before. Doesn't have to kill anyone after.  Oh the steaks are so high. I'm on the edge of my seat. Oooooohhhhh
Movie studios should seriously consider hiring this dude to roast their movies pre release so they can iron out the flaws
I don't think this movie is very good...
That ending with vulture sounds so stupid.
OMG Will Smith's hot do wild West it's ridiculous
"U wont like me when im hungry" hulk doin a snickers commercial
Congratz! You have deserved a dedicated pitch meetings channel from a long time ago! Dedicated pitch meeting channel is TIGHT
wtf, sony? stop, for the love of...just stop.
I'm not sure if you've already done this or attempted this You should do a pitch meeting for megamind
You need todo the transporter trilogy
this pitch meeting is better than the movie itself
Wow wow wow.             Wow.
At some point the movie studios are going to have to start paying Ryan a retainer not to make these pitch meetings…
Gaybius 🤮🗑
Do pitch meetings for Arcane
Where did you get your panda riding a whale shirt? My husband wants one.
Objection 2:15 does not contain a proper "wow wow wow..wow" i.e the last of "wow"s was didn't feel correct
First, it's DC now Marvel; Soney’s Marvel
Can I please create an European or specifically German version of your channel? I love all of your videos!
Sony movies are like the Kardashians, some ppl like them and they make money, but they're not quality.
Haven't seen the movie and I'm super confused: is the whole vulture thing really in the movie ???
"Pretty much every scene is a clean slate here" 😂 The thing I hate the most in movies: inconsistency in plot and/or character development.
please do sonic 2,  and turning red.
Pitching guy: there's gonna be blood everywhere! producer guy: pg 13 pitching guy: theres gonna be blood sound effects everywhere!
This Pitch Meeting is way better than the actual movie
Sorry I didn't come down when you honked your horn. Didn't know you were waiting for me since, for some reason, YouTube doesn't informed me until a few days later that Pitch Meeting dropped a video. Never had this problem when you were on Screen Rant channel.
It’s a good movie. Not perfect, but fun. Better than the majority of superhero’s
We need a Severance pitch meeting.
It's so weird to me that they went in that direction when the 90's cartoon did Morbius so well.
You Gotta do Moonfall next lol omg. Please
morbius isn't a movie, morbius is a cinema masterpiece.... 🙃
They took away Tyrese’s robot arm and gave him temporary super speed
I think a Pitch Meeting for The Cabin In The Woods would be tight, and super easy, barely an inconvenience. 😉
"You want me to spruce up some of that dialogue?" "Not even worth it." That's golden.
The actual story is dark and good. He had no magic abilities, he had the speed and abilities of a man sized vampire bat. His metabolism had him needing to wolf down blood several times a day, but breaking into the blood banks was when he started getting caught and jumped on by Spider Man. That's when the crap started. His other issue is he has horrible time management, he'd try to wait till the last minute until he couldn't stop himself from attacking someone or a animal. And like a vampire bat, he'd cut you bad and drink his own weight in blood if he could. His issues stemmed from his obsession with his research and not wanting to take time away from his lab until he was too manic and hungry to think straight. Morbius should have a high concept adult series, a ethnically Greek actor or just someone who can portray the character right, and follow the og story. Watch the spider man animated series, the stories are so much more adult
You should do the Blade movies
Sci Fi horror movie about a Greek scientist in his late 40s who gets crossed with a vampire bat struggling with his crippling new hyper metabolism, stomach that can only digest blood, and mental degrading into a bat like mentality. And he crosses paths with Spider-Man who is trying to help him without them both killing each other.  Sony: NOPE. Twilight vampire played by girlish man who has magic in powers and no other marvel characters anywhere. And no moral story plot.  It's going to tank.  Sony: *sonichu noises *
Why is this so accurate?
He's going to have 6 pack abs like a bat!" "What kind of bats have you been looking at?" "Batman!"
Bats with tight bods are tight
😂😂😂😂
I waited and nobody honked. Should have know it was a trick
I didn't realize how uneducated I was about bat anatomy.
This channel has saved me A LOT  of movie ticket money.  Never need to see a blockbuster ever again!!!
This is probably the first Marvel movie I’m watching the pitch meeting for before the actual movie, because I really just don’t care that much.
THIS MOVIE SUCKED! MILO  WAS GOOD!
Tbh I didn’t think the movie was thst bad until I watched this video and I understand the backlash now
As soon as I stepped out of the theater, my first thought was, “the ‘super easy, barely an inconvenience’ line is gonna involve the bat, Dragon Ball Z move” 😂😂😂
The movie sucked and didn't make a lot of sense but Leto and Smith were awesome.
This film's greatest crime is that it's mediocre. It's not so terrible as to be ironic entertainment, but it's not good enough to be worth your money seeing it. Surprisingly, the only things good about it are Jared Leto's and Matt Smith's performances. Jared Leto just acts like a normal human being for once, while Matt Smith gets to ham it up as a villain.
Morbius Not Having *AnyThing* to Do With Comic Origins, is Why it Sucks/Flopped. (You Wanna Watch True Morbius, Watch Spider-Man TAS, "NeoGenicNightmare")
So doctor strange but vampire?
Well the movie needs a bad guy and we made morbious is a good guy.
You really have a good point about the "I'm Venom" line. I swear your jokes really make a lot of sense.
Can they do these skits with someone else ? The overacting smugness is too over the top
Funny how nobody in the Batman universe wonders if he's a vampire.
"/love interest because they're both attractive" you could put that in the pitch meeting for just about every movie.
Oh shoot! I forgot the forget button!
It’s currently 6 and still waiting for honks
Now I don't need to see this film at all. Probably for the best
Another Pitch Meeting that's better than the movie 👍🙂
Thanks for letting me know it had nothing to do with Spider-Man 👍🏾
Stargate, you have to do a Stargate franchise, please...
The entire plot could have been avoided if Morbius and his friend just set up a bunch of blood drives around New York City with his friend's money
The spy next door please!
Congratulations to Jared Leto.  He is now the worst character in the worst movie in both comic book universe
If only the studios went through this exact process during script development... the world would be such a happy place.
ohh, thank you for watching a Jared Leto movie so i don't have to.
"I'm never gonna watch this movie I don't care about having it spoiled..." *Vulture stuff* "...oh, he's spent too much time on this for it to be a joke"
I can't see this yet :(
Poor Jared
Yeah 3 is fine, I should be ready by 3.... Wait what 😳 What is happening with these walls 😱😱
What sort of dirt does Jared Leto have on Hollywood that he keeps getting cast in expensive roles when he’s so clearly terrible?
Watching Pitch Meetings is so much easier than seeing this crap in the Theater…barely an inconvenience
"Ha, those are synonyms"
Can you do scream 1,2,3,4and 5 pitch meeting 🥺🙏
A scientist mixed human and bat DNA and not 1 joke about the Corona Virus? I'm a lil disappointed
Ryan: "...if you didn't know, Pitch Meetings are now on their very own channel" Me: Wow wow wow wow...wow
Ryan my man, are we getting a Dune pitch meeting
When he started talking about Vulture, I thought it was gonna end with the Writer refusing it and the Producer saying "Fine, we'll just give Michael Keaton a cameo for the trailer."
they should do a gods of egypt pitch meeting
"Morbius: Oh, that doesn't matter anymore" - In theaters now. Until it's mercifully pulled.
He creates a potential cure by combining human DNA and vampire bat DNA and test it on himself. Then he turns himself into Vampire Batman.   Nope, can’t say that. We’re part of Marvel.   Then he turns himself into a vampire.   That’s better.
It’s so nice to have these highly entertaining movie summaries for movies I have no intention of watching.
I really think movie makers should consult you before filming.
Those are synonyms
If the bats in the beginning of the movie ate animals like the one outside of their cave then why can’t Morbious just go to zoo or a farm somewhere in New York and eat animals instead of killing people? I think a cow has a lot more blood then a human.
Do a pitch meeting for blade
The 90s Buffy movie please?!
I really regret going to the movies to see it it was really bad and I feel like it could have actually been good if they just tried to make it make sense and put more character development into it
i watched this movie and it was a mistake........
Got to do Mrs Doubtfire.  Most messed up big budget movie ever.
Nice try *Screen Rant…*  I’m still not subbing and helping your numbers, even with a different channel.
I was waiting for this video so I don't have to watch the movie
So I'm not seeing this movie. I knew it was gonna be meh at best when the trailers started launching... but this has me dying  "There's gonna be blood everywhere!"  Pg13 "There will be sounds of blood everywhere"  SACK UP SONY
I could hear "because they're both attractive" the moment I saw that kiss scene😆.There was nothing leading up to that moment.
The only way to get jacked drinking bat blood is to drink batman's blood
Missed an opportunity to say "Bat-Pack" lol
a bat ruined my 2020 now a bat  is ruining 2022 for sony and jared leto, nice
this movie doesn't make sense
hey they put the Doctor into a thing called Morbius?  ...what were the chances of that happening again?
seems like I'm late to this premiere
Do Hollow Man please.
*“Those are synonyms”* 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Despite this being for comedic entertainment, this dude seems so p i s s e d with how bad this movie was lol
“There’s gonna be blood everywhere!” 😃  “PG-13.” 😁  “There’s gonna be blood sound effects everywhere!”😃  Sums up the venom movies too.
I don't know who's the real villain here...
Is it bad that I can no longer see a movie without automatically breaking it down in my head "Pitch Meeting" style while watching it?
I Really wanted to like morbius . I waited for ages , and I’m so disappointed
Wait so this guy develops synthetic blood? wtf is synthetic blood? If its like real blood why doesnt he just sell that, dude could probably make a bank and save millions every year....
Brilliant! Once again, I don't need to see the movie and I'm laughing like a loon. "Every scene is a clean slate"
Great Pitch Meeting, the film on the other hand is complete crap.
Oh making fun of movies is tight.
This really describes perfectly how fucking brainless Sony is...
Can you please pick me up at 3:30, I got detention.
Well I'm sure glad I didn't pay to see this crap.
WAIT SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE HULK... ._. a guy got super powers.  kills a LOT OF PEOPLE. but somehow it will be the "good guy" the friend want it ... gets it too... then gets evil
The storyline is literally the same as the Osborns in The Amazing Spider-Man. Extremely rare disease that will soon kill the guy, 2 best friends, needs blood, best friend becomes villain when becoming a hybrid species even tho the main character is a hero for being a hybrid species
I dare you to try to explain the plot of "The Big Sleep" starring Bogart. Might require you to read the book.
#ThoseAreSynonyms
It's 3:04 pm, where are you?
Vulture didn't even build his own stuff.  He had a tech guy for that.  Even if he had all the parts, he wouldn't know how to build it anyway.
Sounds like the same mess every modern movie is like 15 people got to make their own part of the movie then they mash it together
Next time somebody tells me something I don’t give a shit about im gonna go “wow, wow, wow, wow” 🤣😂
This movie has been so thoroughly shitted on I'm definitely going to watch the 'free' version just to witness that level of theatrical feces in all its doodoo glory. Sounds so bad you'd think Leto only took the part cause he got blackmailed over getting caught sucking a kangaroo johnson.
That's another 90 minutes of my life and a chunk of money that you've saved me. Sir, you are doing a public service.
Is this the new Batman movie everyone keeps talking about??  Robert Pattison looks kind of different.
You just saved me the cost of a movie ticket. Thanks Ryan ✌🏿
Jared Leto is a Moffat.
Well at least it’s fully gonna be explained so I don’t need to watch it now lol
They could have raked in the cash if they had added Venom or Spiderman to this movie.
😐 "Those are synonyms." 🤣 🤣 🤣
I knew they'd botch morbius
Hey Ryan, may you please do a Peacemaker Pitch Meeting?
Sounds super power originoly...... or coronay
There will be blood everry where. PG13 There will be blood sound effect everrywhere. Lamao :D
when will moonknight show up and say where's my money Dracula!
omg I was dying at the post credit part! its so true!!
He wants to redeem himself as a comics character but won't go to Disney.....intriguing.
I just got back from seeing the movie. This rant was spot on accurate. It's not worth the time or money. Watch the rant instead. I wish I had.
That "I'm venom" In trailer told me, "this movie is going to be shit"
I swear there's a secret club of writers/directors to troll Jared Leto and make all his films trash
Can you do Dune next? I’ve been waiting for that one! 😍
"What kind of bats you've been looking at though?"  "The guy that dresses up as a bat in that other universe where our lead actor Jared Leto got dumped by a crazy woman"
Wait for real with the vulture stuff? So did no one from Sony even watch no way home?
To bats this is lethal. To humans this is deadly.   ... those are synonyms...  Genius.
I did like Jared Leto in the movie, he did a good job with what he had.  if they had used Spiderman instead of Milo as the antagonist, the movie  could have turned out great, there were good things buried in the move. It was disappointing but I hope Morious the charakter can be redeemed in a future movie.
Can you please do sonic 2 next???
I used to just watch these videos on the Screen Rant channel, but now I'm subscribed to Pitch Meetings, you know, *like a bat.*
<3
"Bat six pack" xD
Jared Leto is the type of actor who think he is alot better than he really is.
Jared leto is either acting badly or over acting. There's nothing inbetween. Should stick to his crappy little band.
So Sony ahs Morbius and Ghost Rider.  Don't they also have Blade too?  If they can borrow Strange they could TOTALLY do a Midnight Sons movie.
Why have I never noticed the photo of Producer guy? Hilarious!!
Feels like faulse advertising Yea, lets do some of that. LOL
Yeah, it doesn't make sense the bats attacking milo because he's one of them. So here's a better ending: instead of morbius trying to inject milo with something that will kill him, it could be something to take away his powers. Milo, not morbius, summons the bats to attack, but they won't, because like morbius said "normally they would've teared me to pieces, but I'm like a brother now". So then, when morbius finally injects milo and he goes back to being just a guy, he's killed by all the bats.
You either die the joker or live long enough to become the bat man. :D
1:28 the kind of bat that is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands
Moribund is jacked
I've watched yesterday. All Ryan says here is true but there's so much more nonsense. HTF "Milo" (a cripple man that for some reasons need to be called not with his real name) injected himself in his spine with the cure?!?
Morbius 🦷 ! Get woke 🌈 ! Go broke 💸 ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Hilarious 😂
I've heard this movie was bad and Ryan really was able to highlight why I don't care to see it 😂
Anyone else literally LOL at 'those are synonyms' ? 😭😭😭
Hey please do a sonic movie 2 pitch meeting
"Super powered upright noses are tighT"!!!
Who else bases their decision on whether to see a movie now on the rundown that Ryan blesses us with? I haven't seen a new movie in the theater or at all for a while and I'm perfectly okay with that 😉
Here is a Twist The vampire bats nests is where the Batcave is
Ooooh lines that are kinda like from the other thing are TIGHT
All could have been avoided if he had used a fruit bat.
"Oh synonyms" haha
Moonfall does need a pitch meeting :D
yeah! super powered upward noses!!!
It'd be nice to see a pitch meeting for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie.
The best joke  was when you put a spoiler warning in the beginning of the video. Like anyone actually wants to see "Morbius"
ey you ever have just one popcorn bag and burn it and you only have one so you eat it anyways  and your like  yum charcoal😄
If I had a nickel for every Sony MCU-adjacent villain whose backstory has something to do with the main hero denying them a cure to a life threatening disease for no reason, I'd have two nickels. Isn't that strange
Hate you Screen Rant. <3
Thank you, Ryan! You just saved me $15
Scrawny Peter Parker got bitten by a genetically-modified spider and also got all ripped... you know, like spiders are.
Those are synonyms  lol
I was waiting at 3. I never heard a honk.
Can you please do a pitch meeting for  "THE DARK TOWER?" it was so bad please watch it.  Matthew maconohey tells people to stop breathing, and so they fall down and DIE.
Damnit sony.... Why must R rated heros keep being pg13'd ?!
“Sexy bats” thank Ryan 4 that imagine! Thanks Marvel for making bad guys, good guys look sexy. I might b pervert now!
Lol the last time they dicked with human and bat dna they got corona virus. Glad to see this movie went a different route.
Man, I've never been more excited to hear a pitch meeting about a movie that I don't want to waste my life watching
For the love of God please do a pitch meeting for: goonies
Morbius should have been rated R.  Change my mind.
So this is Sony Studio movie, and they did do their usual stuff of trying to know better then Marvel Studios.
Please do Licorice Pizza.  It’s gonna need to be 30 minutes long because it’s such a freakin’ mess.
Lol I love these pitch meetings !!!!
Picard.....you have to do the pitch for that train wreck.  Especially since they've announced a third season now in the middle of season second so they took all the drama out of it.
haha . . . I actually enjoyed the movie. Sue me. lol
Worst movie ever
The movie was not bad for me but it felt like the "previously on" video at the begining on a series where they show you the most important parts of the season
"Super-powered upward noses are tight!"  Michael Jackson was ahead of his time.
Do Snatch
"What kind of bats you've been looking at though?" "I made a really thorough research on a thing called 'furry sites', sir. Bats are furry, so furries must know how bats are like in real life." "Fair enough."
What about how it seemed so long to come out and watching trailers for what 5 yrs this movie felt like a reboot of the first trailers
Whoop, wrong Batman.
Screen rant is dead 😂😂😂😂
Thank you for giving us this entertainment. It really helps that I don’t have to watch these movies hearing how ridiculous they are.
Can you do the original predator movie? 🎥
It's 3 now and you're not here yet!
I had no interest in seeing Morbius, but this pitch meeting was so funny I might just have to
1:46 -- Upward nose...? Michael Jackson had vampire powers...?
I haven't subscribed to anything as fast as I did to this channel.  Fuckin gold.
You should do the Lori Petty “Tank Girl” before the Margot Robbie version gets traction. No joke Ice T as a mutant rabbit, bad guy sucks water directly from people and a 5K$ prosthetic mutant rabbit penis prop scene that never made it to theaters. Go figur?
Nice 👍
its funny how he tries to make a cliche out of attractive people hooking up when they are close in proximity cause I dont know if you ever experienced like you know life....but thats what attractive people do... When youre attractive and you go to school or work you hook up with the other attractive people lol.. Thats how life works why does he try to make it seems weird that two attractive people who work together would be hooking up because irl of course they would be hooking up. Ive hooked up with like 85% of the attractive women ive ever worked with and same for school and college.. Would it make more sense for him to be hooking up with an ugly chick? lol you need to drop calling out this cliche dude because its how life actually works... why would attractive people hook up with ugly people instead of other attractive people haha... like the reason they show that happening in EVERY movie is because thats how it always works in real life and they want to cast attractive people so they hook up cause thats realistic. If she wasnt attractive, they wouldnt be hooking up... but since its hollywood and they want to cast attractive people, it only makes sense to have them hooking up because if two people who looked liked that worked together theyd for sure hook up at least once. If you had two single attractive people working together like that and they werent hooking up or werent exs that would just be too unrealistic. I get its hollywood and they just want hot people to be dating and have sexual scenes but thats also how life works. You think jared leto dates ugly chicks? lol
They ruined vulture I think I am not going to watch this movie
What is "continuity"?
Blood sound effects everywheeerrreee
the sacrifices Rhian makes so we don't have to! Respect!
We are pitch meeting.
This film had one of the worse villains Ive ever seen... basically he just spouts blah blah human evolution blah blah word vomit.  And dances at the mirror. And goes to a bar to try and pick up chicks. And then gets into a fight with other dudes. Lame...
This was the most spot on thing ever
I'm only watching this movie cause of Matt
more people watched this video than the movie lmao
Something I found stupid is that in the scene where he makes a cut in his hand to attract the vampire bats, Morbius takes some guy’s machete, leaving that guy without defense. Why didn’t he just bring a pocket knife on him? What if he got there and none of the other guys happened to have a knife on them? Weird.
VIDEO GAME PITCH MEETINGS! Please!!?
When Morbius's girlfriend became a vampire at the end, I literally said to my friend sitting next to me, "wow, wow, wow. Wow."
Poor Jared Leto , can't a competent writer just cast him in a good film for once? I last saw 30 Seconds to Mars live in 2012... man what a dark reality we have descended into since then...
I think this guy had a mental breakdown at the end.
please do the movie focus with margot robbie or chronicle with mbj
Ya I out loud said "kamehameha" when he did the move with the bats.
I just got a Morbius ad before watching this
The fuck...sony...get spidey involved......morons....  look at these box office numbers.  I should be hired...as Department of Common Sense Ideas...but my dept would be severely underfunded.
I'm sure there's more eyeballs to be had reviewing new movies but I'd really rather see a PM for "Superbabies 2: Super Geniuses", 0% on RT.
Making a synthetic blood that won't work forever, sure sounds like they took that from the first Blade movie
You either die a Joker or live long enough to see yourself become a Bat
Sony should just stick to video games and animated movies.
macgyver pitch meeting
I love this channel I never miss a video 🙌🏼
"This movie will make a trillion dollars." some sony exec probably
Finally Marvel fans know how it feels when a bad studio destroys a good comic book movie
I could actually see this as the actual pitch meeting.
There's absolutely no point making a PG13 vampire movie.
Okay but what the HECK is that thumbnail???
2:50 i call that Bad guy ex machina   the only reason hes the "bad guy" morbius was a dick to him and pretty much decided his fate for him  id try and kill morbius too lol
ive realized something i dont even need to watch movies anymore ive got   MatPat  Cinema sins Jeremy Jahns  and those epic movie trailer guys  no need to watch the movie when they watch it for me
Wait…I’m just now realizing I never even saw the trailer for this movie.
Comics:  "I got a papercut and the infusion of tree DNA gave me a 6-pack and the power to teleport by folding reality like origami!"  Real life:  "Ouch...dammit"
So wait…does blade try to kill morbius?  Cuz like…he should.
The plot is extremely similar to Venom
The whole film...dark...and we forgot the dying girl... Whoopsie!
Morbius is Sony running that MCU train to the rground
And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:   (Hebrews 9:27) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
Oh, forgetting about your wife and daughter so you can team up with a vampire is tight!
As an internet Doctor, I recommend you watch this Pitch Meeting and will ask you to visit your real doctor after watching this film lol
Ryan George picking me up at 3 is tight. 😂
Its called Lazy Writing
Like a bat!!!
This was fine and all but legends know that Morbius will definitely go down as one of the movies ever. It's Morbiusmeter is of the charts, this move is among the movies ever, did i mention that? #MorbiusSweep
" As long as it is in the trailer"-   Sounds like Hollywood for the past 20-30 years.
I actually might be getting out of a movie at three. Going to keep an eye out for Ryan
Making a decent Morbius movie with such history and cannon should be super easy, barely an inconvenience.....
0/10 no mention of the scene where they shake a litter box to lure a kitty and the producer going "what, why?" "just cause", "that works!"   To be fair, it's the only scene I know of.
3's no good for me, can we push it back to 4 o'clock?
These pitch meetings become more enjoyable when it is done for a wreckage of a movie
If I was Sony I would literally make a live action remake of the 90s cartoon!!! 25 films which are ALL AWESOME,
Haven't watched the movie. Pretty sure don't want to watch it either. This is better.
So excited for you to make one for “Severance”!!!
do you think screen rant makes an article to relate to what ryan says at the end of every video, or does ryan say something that relates to an article already written?
They made Morbius a good guy who drink synthetic blood???? ....... Sony was too scared to make this rated r and make him, you know, how he really fucking is???? Ugh.
"You won't like me when I'm hangry!"
the subtle eye twitch was great.
Can you do the Megaman fan film please? This one. https://youtu.be/KcLqmH77g_s I know it's no huge budget hollywood movie but I still love it. Please
Wasn't a blood disorder in Amazing Spider-Man 2? Did they copy a plotline?
I really didn’t think this movie was that bad. I kinda liked it tbh
This is my favorite pitch meeting yet. I never laughed more. You nailed this one.
"How did he know she was going to get on that bus, and get on it before her?  Well, sir, he has the ability to know when people will get on buses... just like a bat.
Great video! Can't wait for the shorts
I WAS LITERALLY LIKE HOW DID VULTURE GET HIS SUIT ITS A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERED HIS SUIT WAS CHITARI TECH AND HE WOULDNT HAVE IT IN THIS UNIVERSE!!!!!
1 trillion tickets sold!!!
See you at three, Ryan.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Ryan, for the love of god, remove the telephone ring sound in your audio background!!!
This is the better then the actual movie lol
Two benefits for me from this Pitch Meeting: 1) it's funny. 2) it's contains all I'll ever want to see or know about Morbius.
It would be hilarious to see a “Ambulance” pitch meeting. What happens in this movie? Explosions! Explosions are tight! - What else? What do you mean else?! Explosions for 2,5 hours!
"Theres going to be blood everywhere" "PG13..." "There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere"
The "those are synonyms" killed me.
"Well, it sounds like a movie"
Dear Sony, Please stop making movies. Stick with electronics. For real, no more Sony movies.
IT should have ended with "AND I'M SURE THAT HAVING A BAT DISEASE IN HUMANS WILL HAVE NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TOWARDS PUBLISHING THIS MOVIE!" Then "CORONA COMES OUT Mobius delayed 1.5 years before relase."
To shreds you say?
Pitch Meeting is the reason I stopped thinking "why this movie even exist?" of bad movies.
If I didn't know Pitch Meeting had its own channel, how or why would I be here? lol
I am continuously asking for The Boys pitch meeting since last 1 year, Please Rayan give it to me🤤
I don't know why but I feel like Milo's villian  would be gargoyle
"So we're gonna do a movie about how contamination from a bat ruins people's lives?" "Yeah yeah yeah!" "Do you think that might play badly after the last two years?" "I don't, sir, I think everyone will just love the idea of seeing a scientist flaunting the concept of safety and scientific prudence to mess around with bats and see what happens."
You should do the second best Christmas movie of all time: Lethal Weapon
lmao this movie
More people probably watched this than the actual movie.
Sony at it again. 🤦‍♂️
"Get my lack of common sense out of your damn mouth' -Sony
Ty
Wouldn't want to lose that 'Bat 6-pack' lol.
Pitch meeting for  King's Man movie.
Dude I haven’t even seen the movie and most of this wasn’t even news to me.
Finally! I've been waiting for this all week
Dc and marvel did jared leto dirty
Do a Pitch meeting for “the Boys “
*”Wow , Wow, Wow☺️”*   That made me laugh so hard idk why😭😭😭
So now a crossover Bat vs Bat, Morbius vs Batman.
Wouldn't Vulture have said "where am I? Where's my daughter?!!?"
I was waiting for Producer Guy to exclaim, “Bad guys with the same powers as the good guys are TIGHT!”
Someone please tell Marvel and Sony that these pitch meeting videos are sarcasm and not a model of how to do a pitch meeting for a film.  Pretty sure the pitch meeting for this movie went exactly like this.
"How about we steal the soundtrack from "Batman Begins" and use that as OUR soundtrack? It'll save us tons of money!"
Sonys track record has not been very after Raimi’s Spider-Man 2. I wish they’d give up and just give Spider-Man back to Marvel.
What kinda bats you been looking at tho 😂😂😂
Haven't watched the movie but watching pitch meeting :v
Matt Smith was the only good part.
This is accurate. I still enjoyed the movie.
Not having to scroll through Screen Rant feed is tight!!!
Just saved me $13 hear about the false advertising and crap movie but I didn't know it was this bad 🤣🤣🤣
Gotta love superpowers that give the male main character an instant six-pack. Even Captain America--it would've made more sense, given how muscles work, if the serum changed his physique, but he still had to work out to develop big muscles.
This movie sounds terrible 😂  *adds Pitch Meeting of it to Favorites playlist*
Is you liked Morbius, you are a tasteless moron.
Shredded, like a winged kangaroo!
A kickass 1 and 2 pitch meeting would be tight
"Why was the container ship crewed entirely by eight armed mercenaries rather than, you know, an actual crew?" "Sir, I'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back about that" "Alright, let me get off of that thing."
The first sentence of the Wikipedia plot summary:   "At a hospital in Greece, 10-year-old Michael Morbius welcomes his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo"  Why the fuck is this ten year old boy renaming another kid?  Like, oh hey, we both have cancer, and I don't like your name so I'm giving you one I DO like
It would be funny if it weren't so sad
Intro:  *Spoiler warning* Everyone watching :  AS IF...
Lets do some of that. That sounds great.
Glad I didn`t even see Morius trailer :D
Still not gonna make a captain america meets the president follow up?
Not gonna lie the film isn’t half as bad as they made it out to be. I welcome a sequel.
Why doesn't morbius just drink animal blood?
What do you mean? Morbius was the greatest film ever made. One to rival Spartacus, The Wild Bunch, and Ratatouille. Never again shall there be another cinematic masterpiece so iconic. In fact, I elect to kill myself, so as never to sit through another film, knowing that I could be watching morbius instead.
You won't like me when I'm hungry like a bat.
I was in the line at the cinemas waiting to buy a ticket for ‘bad guys’ but there were a lot of people in the que waiting for Morbius and I haven’t seen a marvel movie in a while (I stopped following it sometime after the first avengers movie), but I was really curious about it from the trailers, I liked one line - it seemed like maybe his character was going to be really playful, something more like iron man or something. I think now I am glad I sticked with my first decision…
Morbius is sweeping the nation!
Every time I hear a car horn outside I have been rushing to the door with my bag - but sadly no Ryan yet 😢
When are executives going to stop hurting their own movies?  I just don't get why they haven't learned this yet.
This is one of my favs lol it shows how everybody in Hollywood wants to adds to the meatball
"Chef's Kiss"
Producer: Didn't Milo inject himself with the same thing? Writer: He did.  Hahaha!
I never skip commercials for Ryan.
Im actually glad they put 2 of the worst actors of our time in a movie i have no intention of watching so atleast they wont be in the main mcu as other characters. Yay.
I agree Marvel wishes it could take all those characters from Sony so they stop messing them up.
Hey Ryan uhm, don't wanna seem so desperate but I was ready at 3 and you didn't come around. I watched out the window for four hours. This is no way to treat a lady, which I am not, but still, the sentence holds true.
Can you do one for The Fountain?
"He's jacked and muscular, you know...like a bat." 🤣
Giving a like and comment to help the algorithm is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Morbius is the guy that Sonic the Hedgehog lives on, right?
0:20 "We're pretty much a part of Marvel Studios now. Did you know that?" THAT is the face of corporate Disney 😂😂 It's like utter insanity hidden behind an overly positive attitude. Heck he even sounded like  Mickey Mouse at one point!
I died at 4:07 "alright, anyway" when screenwriter guy can't deal with explaining thingg to producer guy any further.
I get that with supernatural-origin vampire characteristics, you just have to go with it, but if a vampire story is gonna be all scientific and base it on vampire bat DNA, then it makes no sense for the hybrid dude to need human blood exclusively. Vampire bats aren’t cannibals and they feed on all kinds of critters. He could just buy the drained off blood from a beef processing company.
the ending is false this movie was the first movie ever to get only the best reviews and the first movie to make morbiusdrillion money
Pitch meeting is a great way to show how dumb a movie can be and counter all the people that justify shitty writing. Especially in superhero movies
"So does Morbius ever did solve the problem of how he needs to eventually drink real human blood?"  "No, you see, that is a plotline sooo many scenes before now that its completely irrelevant by the point the movie ends."  "Oh, ok."
3:49 We don't talk about Bruno
“Is she gunna be OK?” “I don’t know!” 😂😂
Love the DBZ reference.
This is better than the movie🤣
So help me they better just come out and say that this movie is NOT canon because omg... just DBGT this shit man, realize you're not doing anything good and scrap it.
Man that thumbnail is creepy lol
Beautiful and brutal. Much love :)
To shreds you say?
This was the first thing I looked for this morning after hearing how Morbius was lol
As soon as they mentioned the girl not getting any resolution to her story I hit like. I honestly forgot her once they hit a certain point.D:
The eyes in thumbnail are the biggest I have seen lol
So cute, they think we care about getting spoiled about this movie.
The Morbius movie had so many PLOT HOLES it was insane
So the movie is bad, huh.  And I was actually excited.
You had me up until "I'll honk when I'm outside.".  We have MAGIC RECTANGLES in our POCKETS.  That can send SIMOULTANEOUSLY upwards of 100,000 Apollo age ships into space.  BUT YOU WANT TO USE THE ARCHAIC FUCKING AIR HORN?
Are the old pitch meeting vids going to be uploaded to this channel
I do like upward noses
This could've been a pitch meeting about how movie studios like to screw Jared Leto
Finally! Someone who ACTUALLY talks about the movie itself, not just the post credit scene!
Every wow wow wow should have a fourth Owen Wilson Woooooaaw.
Another incredible movie that I'll never have to watch now. Thanks, Ryan George.
sounds super power originating
I fucking love how much money this channel saves me.
Good that pitch meetings keep me from wasting time.
"I'll just honk when I'm outside" at the very end got me more than the whole pitch meeting
was i supposed to forget the forget button or was i supposed to forget to forget the forget button, crap somehow i think i did that wrong
Mixing Human DNA and bat DNA is tig.............   Wait a minute, we've been here before.
I remember when Letto used to be about the music...
Ryan twitches his eyes like he's an alien trying to be human for the first time
"What kind of bats has he been looking at?" Me obviously not imagining Batman
Morbius is one of the movies ever made!
What? No  Blade and other Marvel Comics crossovers outside of Spiderman in trailer baiting, revisionist stories, nor alternative universe things that the MCEU blends in its cinema canon as both a hybrid and OC content creator? So... Morbius, like Deadpool, in the movies is right to anti-hero hero of the movie and never an OG villain. Got it. Pity. Morbius's trek from being a mad scientist who is a victim of his own experiments to his being a hero is the best part of his story... now done in the same fashion as a historian coming to speak about Hitler just showing up, saying "Hitler bad." and walking away.
One of those helpful Pitch Meetings that save me watching a really shit movie. Only a 7 min investment. Thanks!
Anything Jared Leto is a pass for me
Was kinda hoping Wesley Snipes would show up and waste Jared Leto.
Haven't seen this but God I hope that vulture scene isn't real
"pretty much every scene is a clean slate now " 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cant help but think in the 2 year covid delays sony were like “hmmm lets cut out all the bits that make the movie make sense”
"You don't like me when i'm hungry!" Great throwback :)
Can you please do a pitch meeting for sonic 2 movie.
The script sounds like it has ADD
This movie was not made for the audience, it was made for pitch meeting
Producer Guy: PG13........... I laughed so hard
This was a very cool analysis, thank you very much! I have referenced your video in our article about the Morbius movie
I like how when Morbius jumped up from inside the building to the roof the policeman who shot him didn't hesitate at all. I guess they train you to deal with supernatural stuff in the police force I suppose
Most of the times it feels that movie studios pay the big bucks to provide content material to Ryan and other youtubers. Blockbuster movies are a joke.
Great video , very funny . Can you do a pitch meeting of the latest resident evil movie . It’s barely an inconvenience
1:28 "What kind of bats you been looking at, tho"  The perplexity on his face killed me 😅
I don't understand why Vampires need blood. For vampire bats, it's just a protein source. They take a little, and move on. Unless it's too many bats, the threat is fairly minimal. In vampire humans, I'd think it would be similar. Extra iron or protein deficiency, maybe some sensitivity to loud noises due to bat sonar, but why burn in sunlight? That's not how vampire bats work! Why the aversion to garlic? Lots of bats like fruits, but we never hear of a fruit bat human!
Sooo many "I don't know" - "fair enough" drops in this lmao
This movie sound like it's so bad that made its pitch meeting bad too.
why are they poisoning the mcu with these garbage movies :(
I actually really enjoyed morbius. Its not perfect, but i enjoyed it.
Ngl this was another Sony comic book character that deserved a Hard R rating (even though it wouldn’t save the film) I mean seriously in the second venom movie they got arguably the most brutal and bloodiest villain in all of marvel (Carnage) and slapped a PG-13 on it. When even freaking Disney confirmed they will be making rates R super hero movies (Deadpool 3 and Blade/so on) you know you’re not pushing the envelope.
The Adam Project next 😁
So basically this movie is a copy of venom, but without main character progression, or any story for that matter
Do Moonfall 😂😂 the plot holes are a potential goldmine for a pitch meeting
"You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" Literally me.
Seems like some soulless corpo up in Sony tower saw that Spiderman did well with references to older films and thought hey lets just put Morbius full of them with no rhyme or reason that will get us money.
2:15 : Matt Smith?  Well, now I Have to see it, no matter how bad it is ^_^
😂👏
What bad movie with an even more bad actor. Pretty good video though, well done, Ryan.
4:36 Oh a _very_ longitudinal fight scene
Sony, please stop. Take your license, make some good video games and don't do a superhero movie ever again.
You know why milo is really evil.. English.
It's crazy.. upon all the delay and reshoots. It still sucked..this is just awful
Vamp from mgs lol
"Spoilers Ahead"   Nobody cares... Nobody cares.
alright see you at 3 :D. love your humor, always brings me to lough! thank you
We are a part of marvel studios now😂😂😂🤣
That sounds worse than vampire diaries and twilight
Thanks for saving us from another bad movie Ryan 😂
I didn't watch the movie, but this pitch meeting is amazing!😄
Yeah, I'm not seeing this movie 😂
Dude?  it’s like 4:30…  thought you’d be here by 3?
I think he thinks Batman is bats🤔
The year is 2022 and a movie THIS dumb still gets past quality control?
But can we do a pitch meeting for The Craft (1996)?? It’s one of my favs
"What kind of bats do you watch that have a six pack?" "The Bale kind."
It’s 3… I’m outside… where r u?? 🥲
I somewhat feel guilty that Ryan has to watch garbage like this for our entertainment.
How did the FBI guy get up there so fast?!  Unclear! 😂😂👏🏻
Putting little girls in comas is tight!
I really hope movie Studios don't start to pay Ryan to mislead us into watching their BS
imagine being spoiled hard by this, but still feel nothing
I love how Matt pretty much says the same quotes over and over again in every video yet they always work.
"everyone keeps telling me with big smiles on their faces but with their eyes twitching for some reason" "Yeah we're pretty much in the MCU now" 🤣🤣 That is exactly how I picture the Sony guys reaction to being acquired by marvel
This movie: "Wow Mr. Chekov, you sure have a lot of guns in your house."
Wuhan bat flue
I love how you acknowledged the fact that the mid-credit scenes were definitely studio notes, haha.
The final fight scene, Ryan described exactly what I was thinking when I watched it last weekend!
"i hope she pulls through"  "me too"  the fuck
POV: you didn’t see the movie but watch this instead
Lord have mercy... what the HECK kind of 'film' is this?! lol  🐲✨🐲✨🐲✨
Man, even pitch meeting for the movie is boring!
I haven’t seen Morbius, but I heard it’s the best movie about Morbius that’s ever been made.
Please do Peacekeeper next
If Morbius is a doctor, is that Milo guy also the Doctor?
Producer guy has so much creative control in this one lmfaoooo
Can you do a video for Arcane?
“Not even worth the effort” sums up the entire movie
I involuntarily laughed when I saw “spoilers ahead.”  Yeah, definitely don’t ruin this one for me buddy.
" we make a movie about more b.s. "
I liked it better than the batman
Shout out to the people who make the trailers, that have been making it really easy to know if your film is gonna flop or not. Saving me tons not going to see them.
Why the heck in these movies main character always battles another one of his own kind?! Venom and other Venom Hulk and the bigger Hulk Iron Man and a bigger Iron Man... and so on
I actually liked it, wasnt horribe by any standards
The Leaks: Let's go kill Spidey! Morbius: Cool ,bro. I don't know who that is, but I'm down! The Movie: Hey, let's make our own avengers! Morbius: Intriguing.
Highest grossing film ever. 69 trillion dollars of revenue.
Do peacemaker
unsubbing from Screenrant was super easy barely and inconvenience
Chose to watch this instead of the movie. I wasn't disappointed.
Sometimes Ryan points out the flaws of otherwise good movies, and sometimes he just lays bare the absurd stupidity of bad movies.   I leave it to you dear reader to decide which of the two categories this Pitch Meeting falls into.
Hey, what about a world war z pitch meeting?
Given that actual vampires exist in Marvel, Morbius has always been a weird character. He was pretty good in the old Spider-Man cartoon though.
Poor guy had to watch Morbius for this Pitch Meeting so he can make us laugh. A sacrifice much appreciated good sir, i salute you.
That is the line from the hulk, he literally said it in Spanish while trying to say angry
“Every scene is a clean slate.” Rabid..
I actually did enjoy the movie, wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t as bad as reviews might lead you to be
He's been looking at the bats on Newgrounds mature art tab for reference.
🤍
Ryan's closing speeches on these episodes seems to get a little sillier each time and I kinda love it  XD
Shoulda had blade hunting down the new vampire in town as the movie's antagonist instead of what we got.
This movie was so bad..they could've saved it I think if they gave morbius and milo more growing up together screen time so that the conflict meant more, they were like brothers.. didn't feel like it though...idk what was worse though...the movie or post credit scenes.
I think this is the first time I watch a pitch meeting of a movie I haven't watched.
"You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" is straight from the show Dexter's Laboratory by Genndy Tartakovsky. In one episode Dexter change into Hulk with eating disorders:)
I don’t know if it’s just me. But I can feel the quote coming from a mile away in every pitch meeting and so I say in sinc with him.   “No it’s gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.”
I sure hope Jared Leto stays in character and uses his crutches to make bathroom breaks take much longer than they should.
I didn't watch the movie because I knew it was going to be a waste of time. And for that reason I was looking forward to this Pich Meeting. You are incredible!!🤩
The Pitch meeting better than the movie.
Is it entertaining at least? I generally like all movies bad or good as long as it’s entertaining still haven’t decided to see this or not
Awesome!  Lots of LOL moments!  I especially liked the "...you keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie.  You don't have to do that."  and "And pretty much every scene is a clean slate here."    Reminds me of some of the X-Men films.
I can't wait to see Morpheus
Who the hell wrote this movie? Two females??
"nope every scene is a clean slate" actually killed me
I usually don’t watch these videos until after I’ve seen them, and it’s actually got me seeing more movies I normally wouldn’t have… but not for this one lol
i bet this is exactly what happened to this movie and that sony executive was avi arad
*All of are dead* pitch meeting please
Shotout to Tyrese Gibson for thinking this was actually in the MCU
what a Leto down...
Have no interest in this character or movie whatsoever
Cause why not! Hahahaha
Has anybody checked on Screen Rant lately? Should we call somebody?
is it just me or is Jared little just the worst
Funny stuff. I actually really like the movie and don't think it deserved all the harsh reviews. Except the end credits scenes don't make sense lol
I’m not gonna lie, I got so bored watching this movie it felt so slow  I thought was an hour in at the 30 minutes mark 😩
yeahhh
Looking forward to a Shocker movie someday 🤞.  One of my underdog favs.
I’m very disappointed that there was no Bat-man joke
The fact that Morbius would've been an amazing movie if it was just set in the MCU... Sony can't do a good movie by themselves
I live for seeing the pitch meeting after the movie
In reality he'd probly just get corona virus...not become a vampire 😆
You know what's funny? I saw the trailer for this movie, and had a sneaking suspicion that it was going to bomb, so I didn't go see it. I'm glad that my suspicions were justified 🤣🤣🤣
PLEASE DO MOONFALL
xD
I was waiting for atleast one spoiler till the end of the video..
Happy Monthbius, everyone!
This Pitch Meeting is better storytelling for Morbius than Morbius
The only reason I'll ever watch this is for Matt Smith
National Treasures 1&2!!
This video will get more views than the actual movie.
Awful post credit scenes
You should do some pitch meetings for some of the real old classics. Like Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, From here to Eternity, or Ben Hur. Or any of the many great movies made before 1970.
No one's going to mention that the mercenaries were hired by Morbius and died protecting his assistant? He just murdered his own employees and kept living his life with no remorse.
I'm just gonna watch this instead of the movie lol
I had two morbius tickets in my car in plain view. Somebody broke my window and put 4 more tickets inside.
Awww...no "get all the way off my back" line?
ha
I wish they would have played 1st two episodes of MoonKnight instead of this Crap.....Class 1 Dracula RipOff
Still waiting for Titanic Pitch Meeting
Dann is almost 3 and I haven’t even showered, can’t go out like this.
Umm I was watching Halo today and sth just was off. I was like….i know this actor…just realised he looks like Ryan😂😂😂
"What kind of bats you've been looking at though?" Producer Guy may have questionable marketing ethics but he is always asking the right questions
Dude 3 o'clock passed you forgot to pick me up
Do they do the I’m venom thing in the movie?
Anyone else watched this so we don't need to see the actual movie.
Can we get a “Dirty Dancing” pitch meeting lol I just feel it would be hilarious!!!!
Jared Leto is one of those actors whose successful career baffles me.
This is one of the best pitch meeting videos yet 😂😂🤣
I was done at "what kind of bats are you looking at though?" 🤣🤣🤣😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pretty good Ryan…not your best, but still good entertainment 😆
watched this, so i don't have to watch the movie. thanks a ton!
"Those are synonyms." hahahaha
I want your shirt. Give it.
"Unclear", is my favorite running joke tbh
- There's gonna be blood everywhere - PG-13 - There's gonna be blood sound effects everywhere
Everything Everywhere All At Once please
I watched this instead of watching the movie. Thank you Ryan! Saved me 12 dollars and 2 hours of my life and was a lot funnier than I imagine the “film” was. Huge MCU fan, but not crazy about the Sony movies or Jared Leto, so this perfect! You are so funny and I always look forward to these! Have a great day everyone!
“You won’t like it when I’m hungry”  So they stole a line from dexter’s laboratory?
Was waiting for the executive to tell the writer to get all the way off his back about the post credit scene idea
A vamp movie that actually SUCKS. Peak irony. 🦇♥️🤣🤣🤣🇵🇭
What kind of bat's was he looking at....Batmen/Batison😂
"What kinda bats you been lookin at though?"
Ryan is a comedy genius . I just feel bad he has to sit through terrible movie's to make his content.
So the big bad of this movie is someone with similar powers to the hero? Maybe this is part of the MCU...
For those wondering, yes, those are the exact lines of the mid-credits scenes in their entirety.
I watch these when I’m uninterested in watching the movie
Only if Morbius passed medical science without cheating, he would've known that blood banks exist
If they EVER make a sequel to Morbius or The Sinister Six. Ryan SHOULD DEFINITELY Talk about how they Killed Vulture's Character and The soul core of the Sinister Six . But we welcome The Ben Affleck of Sony Spiderman Universe
Great video. i feel Ike these movies are written by 12 year olds.
2:16 I’m sorry he’s friends with the doctor???!
Do a Pitch Meeting for Superman Returns
4:11 That line is the "You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else" of this movie.
I do kinda feel bad for Leto. Guy clearly just wants a successful superhero movie. I don't necessarily think he's a bad actor, or the problem.
This sounds so stupid. People need to stop supporting these mediocre Sony films, not even a ticket.
Impossible-to-see Marvel fight scenes are TIGHT!!!!
Since you've done Morbius who is a vampire, I hope you do Pitch Meetings for the Blade Trilogy too! I'd love to see that.
Ironically, Jared redeemed himself as a character in a superhero movie in Snyder's Justice league
It used to bother me, how stupid and shallow these movies are written, but know I know why. It's so we can have these amazing pitch meetings!
Well roasted. 😂
Worst post-credits scene ever 😂
Pitch meeting for "over the top" I like describing the movie to others.  Sylvester Stallone at best/worst
"...you keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie - you don't have to do that." Sort of the problem with almost every big film made today, but if it means Ryan keeps making these I'm okay with it.
Actually “You won’t like me when I’m hungry” is EXACTLY the other thing: in the only MCU Hulk movie when Norton was still working on learning the language and misspoke that’s what he says accidentally
Yup. Such a convoluted mess of a movie. Generic, Basic, Predictable, and Boring.
Am I the only one that watches these before I watch the actual movie so I decide if I should watch the actual movie or not?
uuuhh oooohh spegattiooooos
This pitch meeting may get more views than the actual movie
Pleas make a pitch on stargate and amaszon aquirement of MGM
I refuse to believe Jared Leto is a good actor
Clicking this just to stop that horrific pic from showing up in recommended
I saw Morbius last night and prayed that there would be a pitch meeting made about it....Ryan George just proved he is god 🙌
Ryan: it's all connected.  Uncle Kevin Spoilers: what am I, a joke to you?
4:08
3 came and went 😔
Screen Writer: Hey lets bring this vampire super hero into the MCU!  Producer Guy: Ok but arent we bringing in Blade who kills Vampires??  Screen Writer: oh yeah...oops.  Producer Guy: oppsie!!
Studio Exec: Now that we have a Cult like following do you think it’ll be hard to make them drink the Kool-Aid? Writer: Actually it’s gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
"Those are synonyms." I'm dead 😂
Sounds as bad as I’d imagined … actually, even worse, somehow …
The "oh REALLY?" reaction is SO consistent that I would totally believe he just reused the same shot in every video if it wasn't for the fact that the producer changes wardrobe every time
Sony is like, just throw some scenes in there to reference the MCU
First
Seeing the tease for Sonic 2’s Pitch Meeting at the end was TIGHT
Kung Fu Hustle please
I was going to go see this movie, but figured I would wait a few days for the pitch meeting to come out.  "Won't the wait be difficult?"  No, actually it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
"Lose his bat sixpack" I was also hoping for "losing his bat pack (backpack). I love it regardless and I'll show myself out.
Nice, #MorbiusSweep
Wierd how marvel movies have sort of been derailing while their shows are doing pretty good
Yep. Looks like it is as bad as I thought it would be. Regretful :(
Those are synonymous. Not sure why that line is hilarious but it is..🤣
Man forgot about the Batman begins sound track
Pls do resident evil. Those movies were bad
"What kind of bats have you been looking at, though?" 😂
Goku is in the MCU confirmed.  Thanos should’ve gotten a spirit bomb.
Saw the first 20 minutes of "Morbius," and walked out.  They lost me when Michael Morbius 1) cut his hand and WILLINGLY ALLOWED WILD BLOOD-SUCKING BATS TO SWARM ON HIM... 2) DID NOT WEAR A MASK either at the PACKED AWARDS CEREMONY he attended... OR around OTHER SICK CHILDREN in the HOSPITAL where he works, and THEN 3) handled and dissected ILLEGALLY IMPORTED dead bats - in that very same hospital where there are SICK CHILDREN - and WITHOUT A GODDAMN HAZMAT SUIT.  I was all like, "MOTHERFUCKER, what the HELL do you think you're doing?!  BRUH, if you think it's bad having a goddamn blood disease NOW, just WAIT until you catch COVID-22 or whatever, ASSHAT!"  Basically, I'm pretty sure the script was written BEFORE Covid... AND IT SHOWS.  I'm less concerned about him being a "vampire" and MORE concerned about his being a GODDAMN DISEASE VECTOR.
It's by no fault of Jared's. It's Sony, they have no idea what they're doing -.-
If only humans had a way of making more blood, they could, idk, like “donate” some sometimes.  Just like a pint or so, you know.
It’s been said that the “venom” line was ad-libbed by Leto. But it didn’t make much sense and was calling too much attention to this universe building setup that Sony is forcing.  Goes to show when superior actors like Robert Downey Jr, Samuel Jackson, and Dave Bautista ad-lib iconic moments in the MCU, they actually know what they are talking about, and the lines they say or the things they do add meaning and humor to the scene, rather than distract.
"What kind of bats have you been looking at though?"  Me: "The kind that had a hand in teaching orphans the ancient ways of muscular bods, brooding and grittiness sometime ago. Have you seen those bats? They make us all look out of shape physique wise.
keep cool guys blade 4 and dp3 will undo this
Came here instead of going to see it. I'm not ashamed!
Wow... wow wow,  wow.. wow........wow.
"So how does the character of the Youtube viewer get any work done if he's in the bathroom all day watching pitch meetings?"  "Unclear."
Would love to see a Pitch Meeting for Tropic Thunder!
1:27 "What kind of bats you've been looking at though"  Obviously, the ones from the Calvin Klein catalogues
I feel like watching this qualifies me to say I've watched the movie.
It’s all connected…insert eye twitch here 👀 can you do a TMNT pitch meeting Ryan?
I'm incredibly excited to see this train wreck ^_^
I’m really glad I saw this movie, greatest 7 minutes for sure 😌
Please do Deep Blue Sea that will be epic lol
"Oh, sounds SUPERPOWER-ORIGIN-Y" This has to be added in the 'Trademark Pitch Meetings quotes' book
You called out pretty much all of the problems I found with the movie. Although, it wasn't until a few days after seeing it that I suddenly thought, "Wait, what happened to that coma girl? She just disappeared. "
Thanks for articulating every issue I had with this movie
I really don't even bother to watch many movies with this amazing channel
I have bypassed so many movies because of you! Thank you!!
Ryan, how about a Hill House Netflix series pitch meeting??
Which one is screen writer guy and which one is producer guy in this one 😂  this is greatness
Sony needs to stop trying… ugh 🤦🏼‍♂️
Well I liked the movie..
Sony is the worst
I love pitch meetings they make my day
Kino.
I'm still waiting for Ryan to honk at three.
Jared Leto: Death of an American Scene
I am just learning this thing had a post credits scene. I ran out of the theater the second I thought it was over.
Ryan if I’m ready by 3:00 and your not outside….
The best movie ever.
Since I’m never gonna watch the movie I figured I will get close watching this
This sounds like the worst possible Blade rip-off.
I just subscribed to his new channel. Super easy barely an inconvenience (said for the 3,000 time)
He has ice skates in his feet and a credit card! Y'know, like a bat!
I have a feeling screen rant is gonna lose A LOT of subscribers
While we're on the subject of vampires, you should do a pitch meeting for Van Helsing (2004)
It wasn't that bad
He’s jacked and muscular you know like a bat  That’s not really what bats are known for  Uh ever heard of Batman lol
Is it written somewhere in vampire lore that vampires have to, you know, dredge a human to the last drop in order to survive? Couldn't he just tap a few humans to get one liter or so from each? I know that sounds like a hassle and still uncomfortable to the bitten humans, but beats killing or dying. I bet he could even tap into some kind of subculture of people that enjoy being tapped.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The conflict and charcacter development is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of classic English dramatic literature, most of the weight of the scenario will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Michael’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not only humorous- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the depth in Morbius’ quote: “I am Venom. <snarls> Just kidding, I’m Dr. Michael Morbius at your service.” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jared Leto's genius wit unfolds itself exclusively on the cinematic screens this April 1st. What fools... how I pity them.
I like Dragon ball part.
J'ai attendu passé 3h et tu es jamais venu me chercher maudit menteur!
This is better than the entire movie hands down
Batman that's the kind of bat he's been looking at
I've been looking forward to this  Honestly I don't even watch movies anymore I just watch pitch meetings
Don’t blame Jared. He played his part sooo well!
So many people have been buying tickets then giving this film 5 star reviews… lastly canceling their purchase. 70% my ass 🤣
Wish I could subscribe. What a mess this channel looks, just nasty shorts filler.
why doesnt he just feed on pedophiles and murderers. seems like the right thing to do
Peacemaker!!! Peacemaker!!! Peacemaker!!!
Sony changed what Dr. Strange did in No Way Home is tight!.
Watching a pitch meeting video about a movie I’ll probably never watch is tight!
"he's giant and muscular"  "What kind of bats your been looking at"... Batman...
could you do one for slumdog millionaire
I will not forget the Forget Button, but I will definitely forget this movie!
When the Pitch Meeting is better than the actual film. 😂
Sony people be like, "I want to make a bat-themed superhero, kind of like Batman, but more B.S." "I've got just the thing for you, sir!"
Why did they bring guys with guns on this boat for a medical experiment  So cool a action scene can happen
"No sir that's from a previous scene. You keep referencing things that characters did or said earlier in the movie, you don't have to do that..."  Brilliant😂
It's funny because Sony doesn't know how to do movies.
Morbius is a cinematic masterpiece
As someone who saw the movie.  It wasn't the best, but it still beat Captain Marvel so, eh.   The movie had plenty of flaws but I'll still watch it again. <3 Vampires.
every once in a while, a pitch meeting comes across where I go.... "this might be how the actual Pitch Meeting went down"
Can you do the boys pitch meeting
“What kinds of bats have you been looking at” One of his funniest lines ever
Glad that this channel exists. Ryan deserves that freedom, he was carrying Screenrant’s channel all the way on his back.
You should do The Scorpion King
“There’s going to be blood everywhere.” “PG-13!” “There’s going to be blood sound effects everywhere!”
Sony already owns all those characters.  They don't need to be a part of "Marvel now" as the producer keeps saying.
Man marvels really just pumping out garbage they don't even care anymore
been waiting for this one!
Hi! Pitch meeting for The Lost City please :)
League of Extra-ordinary individual persons who are also mostly men and not very gentle.
the thumbnail in the frontpage kinda startled me ngl
Delivery of “Those are synonyms” killed me 🤣
Somebody please tell these people that vampire bats aren't LITERAL fantasy vampires
This movie was way better than no way home.
Ah. Sooo..... Blade.
I’d like to know Ryan’s monthly movie and movie snack budget… 🤔 😉
i dont know why people hate on jared leto so much. he's not the worst actor out there at all so why everyone acts like he's terrible is beyond me. dallas buyer's club, requiem for a dream. those are great movies with great performances. i think the problem is he takes himself too seriously for most people to swallow.
Yeah, I think this movie is the ultimate lesson of "don't make promises you can't keep"
How to fix Morbius: Replace all the Spiderman references with subtle Blade references and make it R rated for the love of God.  I would love to see a Dark Avengers team of Moon Knight, Morbius, Dare Devil, Blade, The Punisher and Venom. Make all their movies and shows R-Rated, dark, aggressive and violent. Then have cameos from Hakweye when he was Ronin and killing people, Deadpool, Red Hulk, Ghost Rider etc. If they want some female representation throw in Black Cat, Elektra and Silver Sable. But make it all adult rated.  Avengers are for the kids. Dark Avengers are for angsty teens and adults.
"Bats arent known for being jacked'  Well, you'd be weirdly jacked too if every day was upper body day. The weirds thing here is that he doesnt have a super jacked pecks and shoulders, while having weedy little legs
Thank you for the laughs - I was looking forward to this pitch meeting as soon as I saw the film. Thanks Ryan, because of you, bad movies always have a silver lining to look forward to.
Leto should know by now that redemption isn't on the table.
I regretted watch the movie! Did not live upto its hype!
Couldn't he have hunted bad guys like venom did in his movie? You know the other movie Sony did?
Morbius sux
Hollywood, please never stop making bad movies, so we will never have to go a week without Ryan.
Haha loved this, so many great lines. They weren't exaggerating, the movie was really that bad, and I was looking forward to it for months. I had opening night tickets...The movie was well under an hour and a half, and was basically a spruced up trailer, a whole lot of cliches, and that weird fight. I was at a full service restaurant/theater, and was shocked it ended so soon, and was trying to finish my burger when the Vulture scene came on. It was as bad as it sounded, and made no sense. This was easily the worst Marvel movie ever made. It had potential. Jared Leto was way better in SS.
"What kind of bats you been looking at?" Well, Batman...
PitchMeeting: *releases new video* Me: "Wow, wow, wow...................... wow!"
What kind of bad? Well, robert pattinson
So its 3 and your not here Ryan, it really hurts when we make specific plans and you just ghost me. I just feel like we should be better friends then that by now. Any way I still have your sweater, lemme know if you want it before this weekend. I know you have that party and its your favorite sweater.
How did you manage to nail every question I had from seeing this movie? 😂 Should've added the fact that a guy posing as a lawyer is admitted into a jail cell with a package of blood as if he wouldn't have been searched prior to entry
Being sexually attracted to bats like the screenwriter is implied to be is tight!
I'm glad ryan is portraying Sony as desperate and having no creative ideas
You should do Speed, with Sandra Bullock and that one guy.
S.E.B.A.I.
So I usually avoid spoilers for movies that I realistically will never even get around to watching  because....who knows? I MAY some day EVENTUALLY get around to maybe seeing it and HATE spoilers.  I have zero hesitations or worries about ever actually watching Morbius.
Wow.  Thanks god for these, because now I know how awful this movie must really be. Wow
My friend is going to begrudgingly watch Morbius just so they can enjoy this Pitch Meeting
Can we have a movie where the bad guy doesn't just copy the good guys power?
Haven’t seen the movie, don’t know that I will - Kinda wish Jared Leto would just stick to singing and leave it at that.
I guess Vulture doesn’t care about his wife and daughter anymore after moving to the Sony universe.
How about a Pitch Meeting about the film Pitch Perfect II?  That, that, that would be a Perfect Pitch!
Producer Ryan: We're pretty much a part of Marvel Studios, did you know that?  Kevin Feige: *points gun*
Making you money while you save me some
Already 9 and I heard no honking.. are you coming or not?
“Thats like a line from the other thing” 😂
"I'll just honk when I'm outside."  Love the new sign off.
:)
Yeah I'm not gonna watch Morbius, but i sure as hell will watch its pitch meeting. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Huh this reminds me of a Dexter's Lab episode where he invents a cure for a problem he has that ends up turning him into an out of control monster when he's hungry and he says "You won't like me when I'm hungry"
I’m going to watch it now because of this pitch
Ryan watched this movie so you didn’t have to. What a service to humanity.
This was better than actually watching the movie. Sounds virtually identical to a million other shitty attempts at a cinematic universe. And is that seriously how the vulture scenes go? He some how got sent to a different universe. I bet Feige is pissed 😅
It’s a few hours after 3…can I borrow a phone to call my mom?
So wait, they just ripped off the Blade plotline? Where he uses synthetic juice as a blood substitute? Seriously? Also, they ripped off Castlevania's Lords of Shadow version of Dracula. Leto looks exactly like him lol.
This was SO much better than Morbius.
*THAT'S KINDA LIKE THE LINE FROM THE OTHER THING!*
Script writer guy: You don't have to keep referencing things characters did or said in previous scenes.  Producer guy: We have to keep referencing things characters did or said in previous movies.
I feel like there needs to be one of those Dave Chappelle memes where he's saying "Got any more of those bottom of the barrel comic book series?".
please please do 'Honey I shrunk the kids' !!!!
Ryan can you please do a pitch meeting for Scream 2022.
Soooo, that post credit scene was shoehorned to hell and back? Sounds accurate
You know, everyone is talking trash about this movie but judging from the Pitch Meeting it still sounds better than Wonder Woman 2
The scene where the detectives go to the love interests house and shakes a cats a litter box to summon it is one of the dumbest scenes ever
I didn’t want to before, but now  I have to watch this movie just to see if it’s that bad.
The fact that jared letto was in it took me out to reality.
"Those are synonyms." That cracked me up for some reason. 😅😂Jared Leto is going to need some aloe for that sick burn at the end. 🔥😈🤣
I thought Jared Leto was trying to redeem himself after the whole "he's a pedophile" thing, not the Suicide Squad thing.
So funny I watched it twice.  That really does sound bad.
I'm still waiting for Scream's Pitch meeting, Ryan. C'mon 😭
I'm looking for the bats he was looking at.
To be fair, the synthetic blood only actually gets less effective in that one scene where he's testing it- but then somehow remains just as effective for the rest of the movie??  Also I had no idea Matt Smith was even in this until seeing it, but I'm sensing a pattern. Can't wait to see what Marvel villain Peter Capaldi will end up playing lol
You wont like me when im hungry
I'm so happy y'all have your own channel now.
Man, this movie is so boring that even the comedic recap of it is tiring to listen to. Good on ya Ryan for watching through that to give this to us for our sakes!
Spoilers Ahead  I don't think that'll be a problem.
“What kind of bats are you thinking of” 😂
Morbius the only movie
Its all connected 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Sony should take a break from making cinecomics. For a couple of decades.
So Morbius had the means to keep the Twelfth Doctor from dying with no more Regenerations and said no, thereby forcing Clara to plead with the Time Lords after the whole Christmas Town/Planet debacle.  Dang.
I know Jared is a multi-millionaire who's really successful and probably doesn't give 2 shits about what the people think but man, I can't help but feel bad for the guy.. His superheroes movies suuuucked
Honestly I hope this movie flops. If they wont go R-rated, then they might as well cancel the Sony villains verse
Now I want a dragon ball z pitch meeting
I absolutely hate this film.  I was fighting for my life to stay awake, and it's only 104 minutes ffs!
I couldn’t even make it through the movie. It was so bad.
This pitch meeting of morbius is better than the movie and that’s Tight.
This is even more stupid than the Eternals. Someone needs to help these writers make sense.
Sonic 2 when?
I love how he's been saying different things at the end since starting the new channel, lmao. Wow, wow, wow.... Wow.
So... when is Marvel Studios just going to go ahead and buy Sony in its entirety and put them out of their misery? Save us from more second rate super hero movies... Aaaaannnnnyyyyway, as always: *Interstellar and The Martian next please!*
wow wow wow/! now I will not waste $10 watching this movie
“You DIE and I’ll figure this out.” 😂😂😂
“She’s a vampire now because why not?”
I'd say thanks for saving me £10, but I was never ever going to pay to watch this film
Do Adam project
"What kinda bats you been lookin' at?" Ben Afflek.
" You won't like me when I'm hungry" LMAO 🤣🤣🤣  That's the best line they could come up with ??
morbius and spiderman are a silver age classic pairing!
"I'll pick you up at 3" B1tch, it's like 8! Why didn't you tell me 😭😭😭 Lol 🤣
That 👃line tho 😭😭😭
Do a pitch meeting for a Knights Tale. You can make it relavent by making your end joke about Paul Bettany in some way that let's you refrence Wandavision or make a refrence to Heath Ledger later becoming better known for a super villain clown instead of a noble knight.
It's a shame now Morbius won't be in the MCU since Blade is about to show up and in the comics like half of Blade's powers come from Morbius biting him.
I thought morbius was good. Wasn't the best movie or anything but just go watch it for what it is. A comic book movie. People shouldn't be taking it so seriously. It has decent action. He looks badass too. Plus the best thing they did was not put the ending scenes after the credits. There was two like mid credit scenes and that was it. Wish marvel would do this instead of having to wait till the credits finishing rolling.
Is it bad that I still loved the movie?
If this movie is rated R the movie gonna be so good
The look of genuine confusion as he says "That's from a previous scene" had me rolling.
I think this pitch meeting is missing a lot of "it will be just like Twilight, that other successful vampire franchise" moments. The girlfriend becoming one, the sexy body transformation......
Script was bad, but considering what it was, Leto actually did a great job. People gotta stop jumping on the hate train like they do Nickelbck.
"What kind of bats have you been looking at"  Hmm.. hmm, I can imagine. Hey anyone heard about fu-
That feeling when you would rather watch the Pitch Meeting than the actual movie.
No one plans on seeing this to confirm, so I’ll assume Ryan is telling the truth here
#PitchMeeting #TransylvaniaTwist ;)
So, let me get this straight. You put Doctor Who in tis movie but not Blade? The actual vampire who has synthetic blood to drink?
Now morbius sounds like a mfer trying to ice skate uphill
I heard Matt Smith's back was heavily injured by carrying this entire movie
Morbius in the post credits was probably thinking, "who the hell is spiderman?"
I assumed Sony was the bad guy.
Hay theres that "The Cabin in the Woods" film you haven't done yet ?? would be super easy....
This was great😅
This is the closest I'll get to seeing this movie.
Everything, Everywhere all at once
I want to see the Adsturnaut! I miss him! Bring him back home... which is Space. Someone Sponsor my guy here! Adsturnaut! Adsturnaut! Adsturnaut!
"He's gonna be jacked and muscular, like a bat."  "What kind of bats have you been looking at?"  Me: Batman
Is that Vultrure thing real?
Pitch meeting director: previous scenes have nothing to do with current scenes.  Also pitch meeting director: Spider-Man references and Vulture in this move doesn't make sense cause it contradicts a previous movie
I'm just happy this has more from the producer guy inserting bad ideas to the screen writer lol...just feels more realistic 😅
The best thing about Pitch Meeting is how it saves me from spending money on new films that are so full of plot holes they'd be either annoying or unintentionally comedy.  Although the unintentional comedy part is actually kind of intriguing and makes me want to spend money anyway.  So maybe I hate you for making me morbidly curious about terrible movies.
"Those are synonyms"
Not only does the stuff regarding Vulture and the spell not make sense, but they’ve already killed his character. The dude has a whole family (who still cared about him and visited him even after his arrest) and he’s been shown to deeply care about and love them, good. Then, the only thing he can say when he realizes he’s in a new universe and all is “Hope the food’s better in this joint.” Abysmal.
Can't spoil it if I'm not going to watch it!
Fuuuuk, Sony needs to relinquish control of all their properties ASAP.  Just shitting all over these characters.
I'm so proud of u for getting ur own channel. Keep up the great work. Cheers
I'm glad everyone can agree this was not a good movie. You can enjoy the movie but to say it's good is just wrong.
"That's not what bats are known for, but I'm glad you're excited."
Hahaha this is exactly how studio executives think and act.
Request for an Ocean’s Eleven Pitch Meeting please and thank you.
Doesnt he works in a hospital? I am pretty sure he could get plenty of human blood from there.
They really gotta stop with the pg 13 treatment to clearly r rated characters
I feel that yeah! why not? is a new catchphrase.
Another Pitch Meeting that is better than the movie.  I really REALLY hope that studio execs are watching these videos and taking notes.
Only sony has a idea to waste a good character and story.
0:00 through 0:25 - Yeah this was pretty much Sony's attitude when they thought they had Nintendo by the balls with that one sided Play-Station deal. Damn parasites.....
If  they just made everything Deadpool esque rated R it’d be so much better. Venom Morbius probably Kraven
Calvin klein bat models are tight
Sony should just stop. They suck more than Morbius.
Do Olympus has Fallen series!
Michael Keaton in a movie with a man....bat....seems ridiculous
I feel like morbus is is the actual Batman
After watching this movie in the theater. I can’t wait to see your pitch meeting. This so suck
So happy the regular-ish schedule has started again!!!
Free Guy Pitch Meeting next!
I enjoyed more watching "The VELOCIPASTOR" movie last night... Thank me later. 😷🤣😅
Snake Eyes 😎
Is anyone gonna say anything about the villain being a straight up pimp, there was a montage and everything!
Genuinely haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time. This pitch meeting is already a better version by far
I'm going to pirate the living daylight out of this movie!!! 😜
Am I the only one who saw a post about how bad the movie was and then decided to watch the pitch meeting and decided to not watch the movie? 💀
Wasn't there a throwaway joke in Norton's Incredible Hulk where he's speaking Spanish? Portuguese? to the creepers at the factory---he mistranslates it to "You wouldn't like me when I'm...hungry?"
Soooooooooo nobodys gonna talk about that "wont like me when im hungy" line atcually coming from an episode of dexters lab?
How is Morbius drinking blood any different than our oligarchs buying baby's blood for $8,000 liter?  Is the evil uncloaking in front of us now? The only difference between the demon loving Sony compared to the demon loving Disney, is that Sony can make money with Marvel IP like Spiderboi: No Way!  Disney can't make money given they can't not promote man boy love and misandry from girls that got hurt by the boys they wanted and couldn't have.  Whah.  Scissoring isn't a thing, or the whole, men need to have big Richards is bullshite.
Jared Leto seems to think "method acting" means "be a dick". "Imma send used condoms and dead animals to the cast because I'm the Joker haha get it is a joke!" "Imma move only in crutches and slow production for every bathroom break because I'm Morbius I'm weak haha!"
😂😂
Do these MCU movies keep getting dumber and dumber or is it only Ryan getting better?
I haven't even seen this movie yet and I know this is spot on lol
thanks for saving me a trip to watch this movie
I wonder if his sonar eyes look like Rick and Morty eyes on purpose, or if it was a funny coincidence.
Haven't seen the movie but just waiting for blade to show up and kill him.
hey dude its like 7:30 now. I thought you picking me up 🤷🏾‍♂️
Damnit, I missed your honk, three tomorrow?
Thats to bad, I was kinda exited to see this
I want "From Dusk Till Dawn" pitch meeting! That movie is gloriously terrible.
This might be too accurate to how this went down to totally be satire.
ok but that part where the assistant was dying and she went MR MORB DRINK MY JUICE did that not bother anyone else
"PG 13"
I didn't see the movie, but that whole vulture part...if that's real...holy hell. It just sounds like such a bad idea, I have trouble accepting that it really happened.
this movie is so uninteresting that I am watching a spoiler video so I dont have to watch the actual movie...
Am I the only that thoroughly enjoyed the movie? Lots of fun, not a second wasted, great cast and chemistry between them. Had a LOT BETTER time watching this than the Batman, just saying. An Easy 7/10.
The bats that were jacked was batman because that counts.
Now i think at least 100k ppl gona watch morbius just to see pitch meeting 🤣🤣
I know it pissed most of the people about the false advertise. The one in infinity war trailer is reasonable but the one in morbius trailer is not acceptable it feels like you bought a fake item from the shop and you regret it so bad
yet another comic book character ruined by these chumps at sony, marvel, dc, hollyweird, etc, just stop it.  But Pitch Meetings are just pure gold, top quality content 🥰 thanks Ryan
Cool, now do The Expanse.
The fact that people went and saw Morbius is very cringey
Lol imagine if that Vulture dialog was really in the movie 😆
"I was thinking about making a movie that would bomb"  "I have the perfect actor in mind"
Its probably irrelevant but a Frye festival pitch meeting would be funny
"There's gonna be blood *everywhere!"* "PG-13." "There's gonna be blood sound effects *everywhere!"* Beautiful.
“Those are synonyms” 😂😂😂
Now he just skips over the question about why two people are a love interest
"Those are synonyms"
Can you do a pitch meeting on the Departed
Wow that sounds bad. Though the audience score on the movie is 70. This suggests it has cult classic possibilities.
This movie sucked the blood out of me
Spoilers ahead… I don’t think that matters for this movie
Had to to pause the video and laugh for a solid minute at "Like a bat". Bless you
Oh hell yeah a recently released movie that I don’t care enough to avoid spoilers for
I've never forgotten the forget button harder! This is great!
Another homerun.
Excellent now I don't have to see the movie!
Here’s some theories I have about this movie:  1. My dad and I have this theory about why Martine is alive and seems to have become a vampire. Not because Morbius bit her but remember there were 2 vials of serum. Obviously Milo took 1 and he probably took the other and used it on Martine in order to “help” Morbius accept what he was. That explains why she seemed to have died because the same thing happened to the mouse 2. Not really a theory but I do have an explanation for why Milo became an evil Vampire when Morbius didn’t: Morbius just wanted to help people, including Milo, the little girl, and himself. His goal was to become normal, to cure people, not kill them or become an uncontrollable blood sucking killer, hence his horror when he realized what he had become and done and why he saw it as a curse. On the other hand, all Milo cared about was saving himself. _Him_ not dying. Especially considering how he had been treated by “normal” people (those bullies who beat him up) he probably always harbored a deep resentment for those who “had it better” than he did. He even said “why not let them know how it feels.” He definitely also wasn’t really thinking clearly. All he could think about was a cure, not the fact that it had turned him into a monster.
Watched out my window starting at 3 and he never picked me up ☹️
Had two tickets to see Morbius locked in my car and someone broke in and left two more
At 0:26 It sounded like he said  “Lets make a movie about more bs” And boy does that check out 😂😂
Man, if you don't own Screenrant or they are not blackmailing you, you should cut ties with them and be the only one to benefits with your work. This channel should be yours and yours alone. Your material is great.   You were the only reason I was still subscribed to screen rant. Not that their channel was terrible, it was just terribly average.
Morbius has a rare blood disorder. His friend has the same blood disorder. The odds of that are... Stupid.
I had high hopes for this movie. Then I saw a review, and you can see that that didn’t happen.
Can someone remind me what the forget button is? I seem to have forgotten...
I’m a simple man, I see bad reviews on a movie, I go to pitch meetings to see if Ryan has made a sketch on it instead of actually watching it.
The movie wasn't good but wasn't not not that bad
How can a video Spoil a Spoiled  (🤢🤮) movie ?!?
I don't even feel like this is satire.
“You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry” was from the 2008 Edward Norton Incredible Hulk movie.
Those are cinnamons!! 😂
"Blood everywhere" PG13 "Blood sound effect everywhere" *NOICE*
I didn't watch it but I don't care if it gets spoiled. It sounds like such a lame ass character whose movie got pushed back so far that it wasn't good enough to be put out at all. That's it. The movie wasn't important enough to be pushed through at all.
Why is Sony allergic to giving superhero/supervillain movies that are supposed to have R ratings actual R ratings 😅 Like with the success of Deadpool, Logan and The Suicide Squad there is literally no reason not to 🙄
I was contemplating whether to go and watch this last week, instead I waited for this… thank you!
Lmao this is embarrassing
What is he, some kind of... Bat Man
Man, that last scene with vulture, you just made that up right? It sounds way out there to be actually in the movie
From now on, I'll watch first the pitch meeting of every movie before I watch the movie.   seems the right thing to do. 🤔😉✌
Please do a Dune pitch, i need it
When you think about it, Ryan is a true hero. He watched 2h of garbage for us to enjoy this video.
Do a "Blade" Pitch meeting. Also there are 3 of those and the last one is really terrible.
Awesome
“You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry” has to be a call back to the Ed Norton Hulk movie, right?!!!
Is the movie really called "More BS" ?
Ryan please do Mystery Men 😁 funny yet terrible 90s superhero movie !
I saw this movie 😭😭😭
Jared Leto is insanely talented at acting, and insanely untalented at participating in movies that aren't written by 8 year olds.
Hahaha perfect
reasons why I wanted to watch: spider man. What they did: not spider man. Glad I didn't watched
"....those are synonyms...."
"Spoilers ahead" as if anyone would care
I need you to get all the way off my back about not using the catchphrase "I need you to get all the way off my back"
If only this was in the MCU, then we could have Blade rock up
Been waiting for 4 hours, but Ryan still hasn’t picked me up 😢
Vegeta > Morbius
You need to get all the way off my back about story continuity. OKAY!
"Every scene is a clean slate." So to clarify, are we still talking about Morbius or are we talking about Rise of Skywalker?
It really makes me wonder if Sony didn’t just throw stuff into the trailer that weren’t actually in the movie, would the movie have been more well received than it was?  Even just the tiniest little bit
Love Jared, won’t waste my time watching this movie though 😵‍💫
Pitch Meetings:  The place I come to get movie summaries when I have zero plans to ever give it 2 hours of my time...
I wonder what Ryan does for fun. It can't be watching movies, cuz that's his job now. 😃
Can you make a wall e pitch meeting
So is he completely free of Screen Rant now?! Good for him!
The Bladebat.
I actually liked Leto as Morbius.  Hated everything they gave him to say and do and the plot and the background and story, but I liked him.
1:41 needs to be a gif! 😄
"You won't like me when I'm hungry"  Hey that's like the thing I said to the people in my basement when I started running out of food
I'm really liking the outros lately.
super powered upward noses are TIGHT, the excitement in that line though
They can't all be good. Sony's only good decisions are allowing their IP to be used by actual semi-competent studios. They probably could've done a better job if everything didn't have to be PG-13, why have a violent plot and good special effects if they can't be used properly. The Boys does it right with their superhero violence
What the heck, that sounds like they just re-used their terrible plans for The Amazing Spider-Man.
I've been looking forward more to this than the actual movie
The sheer amount of people who subscribed to this is phenomenal
I heard a Dragonball Z reference and pressed the LIKE button.
So they took a line straight from The Incredible Hulk lol
Producer-:28  Writer: Batman
1:28 "What kind of bat you've been looking at?" Batman, clearly 😂😂
…how is it that you haven’t done The Book Of Boba Fett yet?
The fact that the horrible writer understood how bad the post credit scene would be is hilarious.
thank you for not doing a batman-movie
I love watching these pitch meetings on trash movies I have no intention of watching. It's my stand against non-quality Sony garbage.
Watching this movie was extremely difficult, massive inconvenience
One bad movie in DC and one in Marvel too. Balanced as all things should be.
Before the reviews - I will watch this in theatres. After the reviews - I will download this and then watch it. Morbius Pitch meeting - Screw the movie I will watch this.
This movie didn't even deserve its title sequence. The credits were cool. They looked like they should be in a much better Sci-Fi movie.
"Kinda feels like false adverti-"  "MHM that sounds GREAT. Let's do it." "Ooooooookay."
I Was gonna watch it But i watched this video before i made a huge mistake and waste my money
Please do one for the Blade movies! 🤞🏾🤞🏾 that would be awesome!!
At this point I just watch bad movies because I know there will be a pitch meeting movie for it
Hiiii, can you do Pitch Meeting about "MOONFALL" Movie ?
Can I ask for a Pitch Meeting for Arcane on Netflix? I know you do movies, but doing a show on a streaming platform wouldn't be too beyond the pale.
I heard this movie sucked so I’ve been super pumped for the pitch meeting because I know it will be way better!
The way he said,“those are synonymous ”😂😂😂😂
I wonder what Jared Leto sent to his coworkers for this role
First one of these where I haven't watched the actual movie
Well, it was definitely a movie
You watching bad movies so we don’t have to makes our lives super easy barely an inconvenience.
lol, I'll just honk when I'm outside. Gotta watch to the very end! Great stuff, as usual.
AS THE MOVIE GETS WORSE, ITS PITCH MEETING GETS BETTER 😂😂
Please please please do The Room. There is no movie worse than that one.
So he has a blood disorder? Why would he think that bat DNA would do anything... at all?
🤣
UGhhhh my dad wants me to see this movie with him..
I do not even remember seeing Spiderman on the wall.
“Those were synonyms “🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been looking forward to this one. The Pitch Meeting, not the movie. God no, not the movie.
Everything J Leto touches turns to garbage
"So you have a movie for me?" "Eh, kind of"
So he teleported into Sony universe with the suit and wings? Jeebus, i don't think i even want to pirate this crap when it comes out...
"That's not really what bats are known for, but I'm glad you're excited"
It wasn't bad it just wasn't good enough to be a theatrical release. It should have just been released exclusively on Disney Plus.
This made me laugh a lot.  Thanks.
This, sir, might be your best work yet! Thank you for countless laughs and head nods in agreement!!! 😂
Это жир!
So, obviously, Morbius was a terrible movie. But does anybody else feel compelled to defend it on the grounds that it's not as bad as people are saying? Or that many, many, many, MCU movies that are well loved and well reviewed are just as stupid and nonsensical?  Asking for a friend who is me.
"Those are synonyms."
I'm so happy that this is as far as this movie goes for me. I don't even know if this shit has come out yet and I've never been so glad to be out-of-touch. Why watch this garbage when Ryan already told me all I need to know. It's a formula-film like all the others these days. People that still buy tickets to these things deserve to get fleeced.
Ripped to shreds perfectly... like a bat.
"What bats have you been looking at" Erm Batman sir who's always jacked and fit 😳
new rule  Jared Leto stays away from Marvel movies
Still waiting for my ride Ryan... it's 18h
Im so sorry that you had to sit through Morbius in order to write this script
Pitch 'Love Actually' please.
My God... Sony just needs to roll over. They haven't made a good Marvel movie in two decades
Also I think those mercenaries (which people assume are bad people just because they’re mercenaries) were his own security team which he kills basically for no reason.
Dude, it's 4:05pm, what the hell?
The other thing that bugged me about vulture showing up was that he's also now ripped away from his family. Like obviously that's not how Dr Strange's spell is supposed to work, but beyond that he seems pretty chill for a man who no longer has any access to his wife or child being out of prison as he is
It was a really great movie
Original Jumanji with Robin Williams. Please!
It is 5:02 Ryan! I've been waiting for two hours. Where are you?
I just now realized from this that Vulture appearing in this did NOT make sense. Did anyone involved with Morbius watch No Way Home or just the trailer?
The last superhero movie I saw was the Edward Norton Hulk, so I'm glad I have this channel to catch me up.
Awful in the trailer. “I’m venom” was literally the moment I decided I wasn’t watching this 😂
This is ur best work 😂😂😂
If you liked Morbius movie and you know it clap your hadns. 🙏🙏
how is there still no book of boba pitch meeting
More like Morbiass
"you won't like me when i'm hungry" a hulk joke from incredible hulk the movie (you wont like me when i'm mad) so this is a joke within a joke? jokeCEPTION?
Morbius in the ‘90s animated Spider-Man series was actually pretty interesting, but this looks like trash.  Actually, every live-action superhero movie Sony has done on their own has been trash since Spider-Man 2.
Good god, could Morbius be any more "by the numbers" than this?  1) Sick protagonist invents a thing 2) Tests it on himself 3) Becomes a superhero 4) Friend does the same thing 5) Becomes a super villain that the hero has to put down 6) Friend or love interest is being followed but somehow ends up alone with hero for a talk.  Are there any clichés that aren't in this thing or other clichés in this thing that I missed?
Please do a clockwork Orange,the house that jack built,cannabal hallocsust ,a Serbian film
My gosh…. This is priceless!  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
2:10 I mean it actually is the line from the other thing. Bruce said it in Portuguese in The Incredible Hulk
This movie is good for making contrast between good and bad comic book movies
It's doing ok at the Box office though.
Jared Leto wasnt the problem with this movie, the movie was a huge problem. This character fits Leto. It was a mess but I hope they do a proper sequel and stop with the extra obvious interconnected references. 🤦‍♂️
There is going to be blood and gore everywhere  PG-13  There is going to be blood sounds
I love when the script is so bad that the studio exec becomes the voice of reason "those are synonyms..."
What if instead of screwing up the MCU's spell, couldn't they have just... y'know? just used Michael Keaton's Vulture in this universe, as a different Variant of Toomes? why'd they gotta do their own thing and fuck up something that was built up for years? lol
What’s your favorite unnecessary dance scene from an over-the-top villain?   Mine… isn’t the one from this one
Yes sir i do!
"Every scene is a clean slate". Marvel movies in six words.
Pitch Meeting for HIGHLANDER!, next👍
looks like a Calvin Klein model like a bat
Stop honking at 3am!!!!!!!!!
To be fair we really should have seen the Spider-Man graffiti coming as bullshit seeing as though the picture is from Spider-Man PS4. Seriously look at the fingers they’re like 10 inches each.
The clean slate thing had me rolling.
How about a Witcher pitch
Suit: Let's put a Spider-Man poster in the background... then put it in the trailer!  That'll get butts in theater seats!  Paying to see spoilers you've already seen is TIGHT.  Writer: That's from a previous scene.  You keep referencing things characters did or said earlier in the movie.  You don't have to do that. Suit: ... Writer: ... Suit: You mean like Disneyfilm's _Star Wars_ doesn't? Writer: Precisely. Suit: Whoops. Writer: Whoopsies!
Can't wait for moon knight pitch meeting
Do Moonfall!
"Don't forget to forget the forget button...I'll pick you up at three. I'll just honk when I'm outside." LOL🤣
What luck that his actual name is Morbius, and he happens to get a dark type power that goes with his real name. Because that's his REAL name.
those are synonyms
This pitch meeting was better than the movie….and made more sense.
"Well, I sure hope it's going to be hard to screw this movie up! I mean, it's a marvel movie, so of course it won't fail!" "Actually, that's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience"
super powered up noses are tight!
Mad Max Fury Road!!!!
"To bats, this is lethal. To humans, it's deadly." "Those are synonyms."  My post-covid brain: bats = humans?
Ryan could've straight up made this whole plot up and we wouldn't even have an idea because this is as much as we'll ever care about this movie
Where are you? It's almost 5 now
Make a Pitch Meeting for Sonic the Hedgehog 2
This was great. Kinda amazed there wasn’t a joke about the Lucien/Milo name thing though.
This video is how I will learn this plot
If I had watched this movie I’m sure I would understand these references and think they’re funny.
And this is everything I'll see about this movie. Thanks Ryan!
Would making Video Game pitch meetings be super easy barely an inconvenience?
I had so many of the same thoughts when I watched this movie.
He is basically Batman
Haven't seen Morbius. wasn't planning on seeing it.    I stand by that to this day.
i feel like this movie COULD have been good. i actually wanted to see it. i still do, but now i think i’ll just end up making fun of it.
that because nobody is important in a Starbucks
This was such a bad movie.  The only thing that could have redeemed it is if Vulture showed up at the end and was like, "You know what, I'm having second thoughts about you Doc.  That's why I brought a friend..."  And just as the camera pans around, the screen cuts to black and all you hear is this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6VJQZxeWNY
Knowing that Morbius was written by the same people who did Gods of Egypt and several other stinkers makes a lot of sense.
This might just be the greatest Pitch Meeting
🤣 Brilliant as always. Sony really need to back off though and just be happy that Marvel and Disney are making them money without having to do much.
Let's see a pitch for The Adam Project
We dont get enough vampire movies so it really sucks this isnt good
Never expected screenwriter guy to be a furry
I’m glad I went on discount Tuesday. I had to see just how bad this movie was for myself!
A movie and role that actually suited Jared Leto perfectly and they turn in that absolute garbage heap of a script...poor bastard hasn't had shit to work with in comic movies thus far. I still think he did a good job playing Morbius though. They should keep him as the character and get better fucking writers....Writer Guy here needs to be shit canned and have one of his clones take his place.
All we need now is Sonic 2 👀
Sony should really let their games division write scrpits for their movies...clearly they are better than whomever Sony hires for these projects.
So it's his friend that's going to become the villain because his friends like no only I can have the cure not you I'm not looking out for your best interest and then the friends going to get super pissed and take the drug anyway and then become evil okay
He’s super jacked like a bat LOL
I'm not sure if I should feel jealous that @PitchMeeting gets paid to see movies or feel bad that he has to see movies like this to get paid.
TV Show Supernatural Pitch Meeting please
"Spoilers Ahead!" Lmao, like I'm gonna waste my time watching it.
Fun Fact: This Pitch Meeting Alone Is Billions Of Miles Better Than The Actual Movie
Thank you for making this lighthearted video about the best film to ever grace the cinema screen. :) #Morbiussweep !
" Not even worth the effort.." Sums up the movie perfectly
Sony! Do you want Dare Devils? Because that's how you get Dare Devils!
Hahaha that was gold. I knew it'd be crap. Leto is so pretentious those clips of him looking up in the trailers had me laughing.
I left the movie thinking, “this is gonna be a good pitch meeting.”
Jared leto gets so many chances he does not deserve.
I feel like they all just randomly met in a place, called it a set and started filming for fun
Friend: Is it going to be hard to see Morbius without going to the cinema?  Me: Actually it's going to be super easy, barely and inconvenience!  Friend: Oh, really?  Me: Yeah I'll just wait for Ryan to upload the pitch meeting
Man, that vulture thing is just flat out unhinged.
Thanks for confirming I don’t need to watch this piece of shit movie. I mean, I knew I wasn’t going to but it’s nice to have the Pitch Meeting confirmation.
This is the first time I feel like it's genuinely a reenactment of how it actually went.
Avatar the last Airbender series
“Also don’t forget, the forget, the forget button” lmao
When this movie flops, can we stop hiring Leto to ruin everything he touches?
Good god, this movie sounds like it's going for some kind of plot-hole world record.
Morbius really isn't that bad of a movie. Silly at times, but better than both Venom movies, Spiderman 3, both Andrew Garfield Spiderman's, a few X-Men movies, and the Fantastic 4 movies.
Wait how does he know so much about this movie? Do people willing watch bad movies?🧐
Pitch Meetings save me so much time and money.
This is why it sold 2 trillion tickets
If these guys ever switched jobs, can you imagine all the bad decisions that would no longer be made?
It's sad that Matt Smith was convinced to take the role because Karen Gillan (MCU's Nebula) encouraged him too, and neither knew what was coming...  Perhaps she should've specified Disney's Marvel Studios, not just any old 'Marvel' movie. Between this and Terminator Genisys, Matt is not having that great a Hollywood career.
The whole Sony Marvel Universe is so stupid.
Morbius was perfect to be r rated.  Like Venom. And yet we have to endure this shit
I usually save these after I watched the movie, but I'll never watch Morbius. Sounds like a dumpster fire.
Great, now I dont have to watch the movie, the plot to this dumpster fire is a total crap shoot
I went to see it with absolutely no expectations... Was definitely disappointed, it was an ok watch but there was no tension and I didn't give a sh** about any of the characters
Dr. Michael Morbius and Paolo Gucci both say “chic” in their films. XD
One of the movies of all time
"Hey, wasn't the Vulture's whole motivation about him supporting his family and especially his daughter?"   "Yeah, why?"   "Shouldn't he be freaking out now that he's traveled into another dimension with no way to get back? Especially since it's entirely possible his family doesn't even exist in this dimension?"  "Well here's the thing, get ALL the way off of my back!"
I think there is a big reason why this movie doesn't work...literally no context to wth is happening. Combine that with bad writing, and editing then you have a recipe for a disaster. I wish I just watched this and not the movie at all...I hate that I wasted my time.
Note to self. If you don't want to die by choking on your food. Don't eat and watch PITCH MEETING at the same time.
Scriptguy is into Bat-Fury stuff! The Universe gets bigger and bigger!
I am so damn tired of the villains in Marvel movies having the same powers/abilities as the protagonist.
So it's basically the amazing spider man and venom in a blender, thanks for saving me some $$
"You keep referencing previous things that characters said or did in the movie, you don't have to do that."  LMAO
That Vulture thing really happened as Producer Guy said?
I never see 90% of these movies. Should I?
"Basically" a part of the MCU
"so you have a movie for me?" "yes sir i do. it's called morbius" "ah yes, people were wondering when he was gonna ride his jetski" "no sir, this is MOR-BIUS"
Please do little monsters with Howie mendel
I'm not sure why, but "those are synonyms" got me more than it should've 🤣
Just want to say, we love you Ryan. You are not only funny but have your hand on the pulse of how ridiculous Hollywood and the world is. Keep it up man!
Honestly the movie was actually pretty good. I don’t understand the hate; it was a simple yet compelling movie and the postcredits were very promising
"I thought they were supposed to be incognito?" "No, the Cognito coffee shop closed during the pandemic, so we had them go to this one instead".
They could've gone with a full R, but nooo.... In their misguided attempt at intergrating themselves further into the MCU, in spite of everybody knowing that the mess that is the Sony Spiderverse isn't and will never be MCU, they made an action movie about a vampire, bloodless.  Even Marvel is keeping Deadpool R, under the 20th Century Studios banner, pretty sly since it's not technically a Disney movie...  Keep falling down, Pascal and Co.
I've never laughed so hard at synonyms.
i was going to say something about hollywood writers not being able to read above a third grade level but most children's books have a more coherent plot
This is the one pich meeting where having the spoiler warning was optional
Never saw the movie but i may as well watch pitch meeting coz why not.
I was excited for this than any other Sony Marvel movie
It sounds very Amy Pascal-ish.
I learned some interesting stuff. So Jim Carrey is retiring soon.
The bat kamehameha really killed me lmao
"you won't like me when I'm hungry" Me : but.......isn't that everyone though? You won't even recognize me when I'm hungry, nobody and nothing will stand between me and food, NOBODY
So glad he mentioned how stupid the I am venom comment was
Since we’ve got a monster hero pitch meeting how about a Monsters Inc pitch meeting  Script writer guy: “She goes I’m watching you Wazowski always watching” Producer guy: “Always watching a guy called Mike is tight!” Mike guy: “What?!”
Hey, isn't Blade part of the Marvel universe and a teaser about him would have made a lot more sense? Oh, whoops!
Listen my guy.. Are gou gonna do Arcane or not?? _👀👀_
He sound like he said MORE BS rather Morbius
Sonic 2
"he's shredded cause of the bat DNA" killed me 😂 I think in real life vampire bats are like small and frail, even for a bat. So their DNA definitely wouldn't make you superhuman.. more likely just give you rabies 🤣
The Dragon Ball Z reference gave light to all of this. Funny, but cringing at how bad the movie sounds lol but let us not forget "Evolutions"..............
Sony has been riding that Spider-adjacent train for years and finally derailed it.
Vampire movies never get good ratings
*love-interest-cause-they're-both-attractive* is muh new career goal.
This movie features the two most useless FBI agents ever….
Sonic movie 2 pitch meeting soon?
Thanks to this video, I didn't waste 2 hours of my life!
gods I hate Sony's marvel projects so much
Resident evil series please!  Ooh! Or the Sherlock Holmes movies with RDJ! Yeah yeah yeah! I wanna see screenwriter guys breakdown of those slo mo scenes that are kinda cool in the first movie but get overused to shit in the second 😂
"So he needs blood to survive?"  "Yeah, or he might die or something."  "You realize there are people with health conditions that need a constant supply of blood, right? Why doesn't he just go and buys some?"  "So the movie can happen."  "Ok."
Big win getting the channel, Ryan. Well done.
Spent way too much time after this movie saying "if they did this it would have been better". I wanted to like it more, but there were so many missed opportunities.
I don’t watch bad movies anymore, I just watch pitch meetings of bad movies.
So glad im never gonna watch this movie.
Please complete backbtovthr future 2 amd 3 pitch meeting 👀
Champion Effort!  Sounds like they should have put more Spiderman in it. Jared Leto should be banned from comic book characters. 🦇🧛🦇🧛🦇🧛🦇🧛🦇🧛🦇🕸🧛🦇🧛🦇🧛🦇🧛
Saw Jared Letto on the cover of Men's Health the other day at a hospital. The article was something about how he has stayed so healthy and fit in his life. I am gonna say they never touched on the fact that he's prolly never done any real manual labor in his life and has his own personal trainer. What was even better was the fact that it was at a hospital and it was a celebrity expressing how we should all live. Cuz we don't have enough of that already.
Forget button: Forgotten
2:09 No, it's exactly the line from the other thing. Because nobody explained to the writers that A) "hambre" and "enojo" sound nothing alike and B) that they should be speaking PORTUGUESE in Brazil, not SPANISH.
He should to say "WE are Venom"
"Those are synonyms" had me rolling. People in the library were looking at me funny.
“What kind of bats have you been looking at?”  “Well, there’s this one that’s quite popular on the internet. I believe her name was Rouge or something?”  “Oh, like the Star Wars movie!”  “Sir, we can’t get into this again, so I’ll just move on.”  “Maybe I should look her up to get some references and…”  “Uh sir, I would recommend turning safesearch on for that.”  “Oh really? Why do you say… oh my god. Ohmygod.”
How could a super hero movie starring Jared Leto be bad?
I'm not Jewish in anyway but I really love your videos
"y'know, like a BAT" XD
LMMMMMFAO hes gonna be shredded ya know like a bat. Yea i like how excited you are about this but what kinda bats u been looking at. WTF MAN IM D.A CRYING MAN!
Do Turning red , she is practical a p…
Forbidden planet (de 1956) pourrai être un bon film (?)... It's a movie from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ;  The office and prop where the pitch meeting would take place could be fun to see.
From the worst pandemic in a century supposedly originated from a bat, it took only around 2 years to have the balls to make a Marvel movie about it.
😀Next it would be interesting to see a pitch meeting on the double movie feature- Sonic The Hedgehog 2. It was a Sonic movie and- a wedding drama comedy flick as well.
Fantastic as always Ryan.  I was really hoping you’d shoehorn in a doctor who reference though.  I’m sure it would have been super easy, barely an inconvenience.
XD was waiting for this one HELL YEAH
why does it seem that the old spider man TV show did these story lines better than Sony can do?
Will never see this but it does sound like Sony forced the writers and director to make it PG-13 and the whole movie only exists so Sony can keep the rights to Spider Man from Marvel
The first Pitch Meeting I've watched without having seen the movie first... all because I expect it to be 100x better than the movie itself, & a better use of my time 😂
I like how by the end the producer guy just becomes the writer and and the writer questions his ideas, like they exchange the roles you get the point.
Normally I hold off watching pitch meeting until after I've seen the film, didn't feel like I needed to this time, and I was correct!
Love it. Still want that Battle Ship Pitch Meeting.
morbius really said "don't become like me, these powers are a curse," kills milo then is like "nvm these powers are cool."
haven't seen this movie but i guess i have some context now i watched it's pitch meeting 😅😂
Ah Michele Jackson
Sounds to me like someone is #MadAtMorb #MorbiusSweep First movie to sell 1 trillion tickets
Feel bad for Jared Leto you could see how passionate he was about this film :(
this comment is just here to remind everyone that Jared Leto is a known pedophile and possible cult leader (the jury's still out on whether or not his cult has crossed the line from elaborate joke to actual cult)
could you pitch the show "raised by wolves"? please, i dare you because it is impossible to desscribe without having the producer to get a stroke =)
"Jacked and muscular just like a bat" lol I love his way with words 🤣😂 I feel bad for Jared Leto bombing again. Seems like he was way better in Morbius
I'm going to say it again...  Thank you for separating from the SC channel - I had to unsub several whiles back because of the overflow of content.  Glad I can see these in my sub list again!
Saw it last night - damn, you nail so many of the inconsistencies lol
Another movie I won't waste my time watching. Thanks Ryan. You are a scholar and a gentleman.
Be honest, you weren't going to see it. The spoiler warning didn't mean anything.
Morbuis was never a really popular character, I’m not surprised it’s not doing well
I hope Matt Smith is good in this.
Morbius is the best film ever wdym
This really feels like how the conversation actually went down for this. I walked away from watching the movie thinking “this guy has a goldmine in this”
Morbius Fever is sweeping the nation, folks.
Another soulless marvel movie, from the same douchebags, that made Venom 1 & 2.. yay!  NO blood and gore.. the very thing, that these characters are known for - THIS WILL BE ANOTHER HARD PASS!!!
Oh my gosh, why.  No.  Why would they do any of that.  x_x
At this point, I think you kinda deserve what you get casting Leto in your movie.
Look at the writers of the movie and you will understand why it's so bad. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are the people responsible for this mess. These are the guys who made  Dracula Untold, Gods of Egypt and The Last Witch Hunter to name a few. Big budget Hollywood flops with stupid cliche and zero logic in storyline. They can't write a good story to save their lives. Avoid anything these two morons touch, it will be bad.
Do the Austin Powers trilogy. Goldmember at the very least, and you know why.
Yayyyy
Movie pitch for Water World!
1000th Comment
Why go to a Boat?? Why hire mercenary instead of my doctors/scientis?? Whyy??
I love how consistent Ryan is with Pitch Meeting. Every video is gold!
Imagine if Sony lost spider man? First and foremost i think these solo villain films from the spider verse are unnecessary,Kraven should be in a spider man film and morbius should have been in a Blade film
Leave it to Sony to screw up the MCU. Maybe they can string together an actual story before filming for once. They should try that.
Scarface pitchmeeting
Somehow I think all executive producers really want to punish Jared Leto by putting him in the worst movie possible
A certified #MorbiusSweep moment right here
Yes!!!    Yes!!!!    Yes!!!!!!    Yes!!!!   Yeahhhhhhhhh!!!
"I don't know" is my favorite catch phrase
For once I actually just watched the pitch meeting INSTEAD of the movie. Not really interested, this was probably more entertaining.
Redeem himself? Suicide squad was good tho👁👄👁
Movie sucked so bad.
I thought you were going to make a joke about the audio syncing
"What Kind of Bats have you been looking at"??? 🤔
Oh please tell me the movie makes a "plasma" referencing the '90s censorship.
Did you know that Sony is a huge part of Marvel Studios!!!
I appreciate that Ryan suffers so we don't have to.
I didn’t see the movie yet but it sounds like a total mess than any pitch meeting before
This is the first pitch meeting where it genuinely feels like this was the actual pitch meeting for the movie
Really wish u referenced the dancing mirror scene
Leto's Joker is looking pretty good next to this film. (I actually kind of like Suicide Squad. Hoping we get the Ayer cut).
“You want me to spruce up any of that dialogue?”  “Nope”  😂😂
"There's going to blood EVERYWHERE!" "PG-13" "There's going to be sounds of blood EVERYWHERE!"
Ryan spent more efforts in making this pitch meeting than the actual writers of the movie.
The movie was good, glad I boycott trailers… okay byeeeee
Me to Wife: "Ryan's Pitch Meetings makes avoiding bad movies super easy, barely an inconvenience." . Wife: "Oh really?" . Me: *snicker
“Those are synonyms” LMAOO why was that so funny lmao 😂
"those are synonyms!"
Was that you honking at 3 o'clock? I thought it was a goose. You really should use your car horn to honk.
Funny. Like this isn't the 21st century and you can't go to a blooe bank. Or if you are so rich run your own blood bank.
sometimes i wonder... does Ryan knows that people actually love this show?
Dude it's like 4:50 p.m.! I'm so sorry I'm not home I'll be home soon. I'm glad you can give me a ride. You did mean today right? Ryan George? Are you still giving me a ride thank you for putting it in the video I wouldn't have known otherwise. I'll come home right now where are we going? I'll follow you anyway Ryan George. It's super easy barely an inconvenience.
When it's almost five and you haven't heard anyone honking outside so you start to feel ditched 🙄
I heard the honk outside and i went.
I wait to see the movie so I don't get Pitch Meeting spoilers
Ryan, this is a funny post. Hey, I just thought of a really good idea for a Pitch Meeting...how about "The Seventh Seal" by Ingmar Bergman?
Watching pitch meetings on pitch meeting’s channel is super easy, barely an inconvenience
"Those are synonyms..." Idk why, but that killed me
To bats this movie is lethal, to people it's deadly
FUN FACT: In the MCU the Tinkerer created the vulture suit from salvaged Chitauri technology left over from the battle of New York.  Toomes is now in the Venom/Morbius universe which means no New York Chitauri battle so no left over Chitauri technology and no Tinkerer to create the suit for him. Toomes is not a mechanical engineer so how did he get a suit made and where did he get the materials from?  This is a brand new universe to him so all current MCU locations don't exist in the Venom/Morbius universe.  It would also obviously cost a shit ton of money for anyone to construct a suit like that and he is a prisoner (again, not a mechanical engineer) who was transported into a new universe which means he is technically a homeless person. This is just further proof that Spiderman NWH was a success because of the MCU and not Sony.
I loved Kermode’s review of this: Jared Leto isn’t the best actor in the world and he’s not even the best Jared in this movie.
I bet there's an *Intern Guy* hearing all this and thinking "Why" and "What's the goal here?"
Leto needs a new agent...
My friends and I left the movie saying “the Pitch Meeting for this one is gonna be awesome!” The Bat-douken was definitely the silliest part 🦇
Is villain with the same powers as the hero not worth mentioning anymore or is it just that it doesn't count because vampire?
We witnessed the birth of a new catchphrase in the Ryanverse. “Cause why not?” 👏
I am probably one of the only people in America that actually liked this move. I'm not going to act like it's a masterpiece, and I'm not going to act like it's up to the standards that Marvel films had set. But I enjoyed it, I liked the Morbius character, it was good enough for me to be glad I paid money to see it.   Heck, I liked it a lot better than the Eternals movie
"Super-powered upward noses are tight!" Hahaha! There's a line I never expected to hear.
I sense a Sony/Disney merger after this superhero movie dud here
Make a Dune (The newer one) pitch meeting
‘Those are synonyms’ should be a new Ryan catch phrase
False advertising is tight
Well Milo used powers Morbius never used which is why he used the bats kamehameha🤣
After I heard "bat six pack" my brain went blank and pretty much zoned out for the rest of the Pitch Meeting. I'll have to watch it again.
I love how both the producer guy and the pitch guy complain that the other one doesn't make any sense.
I expect this channel to have millions of subscribers by the end of the year.
i normally wait till after seeing a movie, but ... #letmegetoffofthatthing
Does... Does Vulture not care about his daughter? Or remember she exists? What.
Watching the pitch meeting without having watched the movie it’s from is TIGHT!
Synonyms are tight they are also awesome
A vampire movie without blood. Then what is even the point ?
this is a comment
Why didn’t he just drink blood from hospital bags? It’s the real thing and he can just drink one donation bag he stole and then his substitute. And more importantly, he doesn’t need to accidentally kill someone. Why we gotta do all this drama?
All I gotta say is... WORST movie EVER
I was never gonna watch this movie anyway
Wow that movie sounds terrible 😆
Super-strength isn't something I think of in relation to bats.  They actually seem rather fragile.
Patiently waiting for Ryan George to pick me up......  Looks at clock....  4:42?  Wait, did he mean 3am or 3pm...  Did he even mean today?  Hmmm, guess I'll just have to wait by the door every 12 hours.
That ending with Vulture was so force and made zero sense. His reaction sent there is unrealistic. Dr. Strange senting him there makes no sense. Unless the spell was to sent away all villains from that universe who know Peter is Spider-Man to another universe. But why morbius universe? Coincidence? Anyway than there the fact his got his Vulture suit. How the hell did he get that. He doesn't have Stark nor alien tech in this universe. He also doesn't have his crew to help steal it. Sony just loves throwing sh^t together even if it makes no sense. Also won't his character want to go back to see his daughter like sandman did. Not team up with some stranger to do good. None of this crap makes sense.
It’s past 3 and I’m still waiting.
Getting 2 new videos from Ryan in one week is TIGHT!
You can/should  remake/update the old videos... please
This was better than the movie! And explains the entire point in an engaging way
A final fight between two characters with identical powers? This really is part of the Marvel Universe!
MORBIUS SWEEP!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOO
Can't wait to attempt to watch this movie when's it's on TBS in a few years 😂😂😂
"Spoilers" if you care about that for a god awful movie. Sony needs to just GIVE the Spider-Man rights back to Marvel Studios (Morbius is part of those film rights in case some people don't understand that).
Do Fast & Furious 6 (2013)
Do Fast & Furious (2009)
Do The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
MCU is known for putting in scenes in trailers that aren't in the movie or altered.
Ive been waiting for an hour Ryan, why havent you honked yet?
Do 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
It's like 5 different Morbius movies were written and then they just used chapters from each one even if they didn't flow with each other
Be careful out there guys! I had 2 Morbius tickets in my car and someone broke the window  and left 4 more
I just love "wow wow wow. wow."
Do The Fast and the Furious (2001)
I'll wait until the DVD is in the $3 bin at Walmart. So......July?
"Every scene is a clean slate" LMAO. Another amazing pitch meeting!
*… « he’s jacked and muscular, you know like a bat »* 😂🤣🤣
You did a Pitch Meeting for Pitch Meeting. How about a Pitch Meeting for “The Making of a Pitch Meeting” and then do a “The Making of a Pitch Meeting.”
I would love to see a pitch meeting for Steven Universe!
He watched it so we didn't have to. Legend.
that thumbnail terrifies me
Awww missed opportunities about the bat joke and saying Batman!
I like my supermodels buff...like a bat.
Wow wow wow. Wow.
With each new flop, I look forward to the Pitch Meeting video of it! Thank goodness so much junk is being made!
At some point, these pitch meetings do sound like what actually happened at the studio actual pitch meeting.
Wow wow wow. Wow.
Oh, a Die Hard 2 Pitch Meeting would be tight!
A Morbius movie...where he is not only the protagonist, but a hero? ...and it's PG-13. I smell dumpster fire. Also, whoever wrote the script have zero clues who Morbius is and gives zero fucks. The Morbmeister has no control of his actions when hungry, a surfeit of remorse afterwards, yet no will or interest in ending his cycle of emo - raving beast - emo. Way too selfish to ever be considered a hero, except perhaps in his own mind, though he occasionally teams up with or is used by heroes.  Morbius, along with his origin, would probably have made a decent enemy in a Spiderman movie. With the proper theming, the right script and director, and a Halloween release date, it might even have been a good action/horror movie. Conceivably even with a (yuck) PG-13 rating.
Boondocks saints or Apocalypse Now , also have you ever thought about doing screen rants for video games
he as to drink blood every 6 hours? so basically he can't even have a good night sleep? why live then? ah right, for the 6 pack.
It really is sad that the 'outline' of the script is actually good. Scientist finds cure to cure himself becomes far more than what he planned contemplates sacrificing himself for the greater good Meets a villain that causes untold havoc/stops him just before havoc is unleashed Get to the end where the lead contemplates sacrificing himself again, sees the news of other villains (Footage of venom eating someone would be freaking perfect) and decides to hold off "If I ever go feral," he says to someone off camera, "I need you to stop me." Showing that he understands that he is still a risk, even if he plans to do good Camera pans to show Blade  How hard is that???
The post-credit's scenes were infuriating
You saved me from wasting $15 at the box office. Thanks.
I liked it.
At least with a movie that has a shitty trailer and is centered on Jared Leto of all people, I have no desire to watch the movie therefore don't need to postpone watching pitch meetings :D (Still haven't watched the Spiderman No Way Home pitch meeting T_T).
Honestly kind of glad it sucked 🙃
One thing I've always said about the Pitch Meeting series is, between the catch-phrase lines that provide the structure of each episode, the humor is derived from 100% valid criticisms of individual movies and the industry as whole.
2:09 got me confused for a second, I was like "snickers commercial? no, wait, Hulk, same concept, different wording"
fuckin funny.
What happened to studio guys voice? This normal one makes me nostalgic
I like how I watched this whole thing and still have no idea what the story of this movie is.
I couldn’t wait to watch this so I could avoid paying money to see the actual movie.
I kinda wanted to see this movie, it looked cool and after the new Batman movie I had hope. Thank you for squashing all interest in this movie in the most enjoyable and humorous way possible, Ryan, now I won't waste my money! :)
pitch meaning of the 1st independence day. (i heard they made the script of that movie in a afternoon inside a coffee shop.) and wow! what a damn great movie! the second part took 20 years and was just awful.
Morbius?  More like More BS, amirite?
Thank God I chose to go to Sonic 2 when that comes out over this
did he just say "don't forget to forget the forget button" ??
Watch this instead of the actual movie, this video is way better than the movie
He turns himself into a Vampire, funniest shit I've ever seen
I don't have the budget to keep up with the Pitch Meetings movies anymore
Not the best Pitch Meeting, but you can't win them all. :) On another note, Jared Letto isn't a lead actor, in my opinion. They need to stop putting him in roles like this. Though just like with Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure Letto can find a hero/villain that suites him well. Oh! Just like Chris Evans, too! You just gotta find your perfect role.
“Those are synonyms” had me rolling…
It takes so little effort to make a movie these days.
Hah, this thing turned into a competition of bad ideas :D
Sony sure have a lot of hard work to do with that narratively impossible post credit scene.
"You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry" was already used in the 2008 Incredible Hulk movie.
- There's gonna be blood everywhere! PG13... - There's gonna be blood sound effects everywhere! 🤣🤣🤣
"We are Pitch Meetings" 😁
I’m worried that you had to watch the film multiple times to remember the dialogue word for word. Why would you do such a thing to yourself?
Glad I'm seeing this at 1:30. I didn't know we were hanging today Ryan, but I'm looking forward to it 🙌🏼
Not sure what reviews you found but Morbius has been around 200% on Rotten Tomatoes for a week and still expected to rise
"To bats this is lethal to humans its deadly"  "Those are synonyms." 🤣🤣🤣
In the modern US, buying blood from slaughterhouses is a simple way to get large quantities of blood.  Not to mention paying people to donate blood.
“Blood everywhere!” PG13 “Blood sound effects everywhere!”  Love that
upward nose is TIGHT
Ryan, screenwriters need to fear you!
4:40 Ohh really?
I thought the movie was great! It wasn't the best and the post credits was… questionable just because there's no motive ? Other than that I loved it. CGI was a little off on some scenes but Jared's performance was amazing as always. Definitely not as bad as the critics make it out to be.
I love you Ryan. 😘
(◔ᴗ◔) Dragon balls are tight..!

Those are synonyms 🤓😝

"what kind of bats you looking at though?"  Poor guy, never even heard of wikibat
I don’t know why but I spit my soup out when he said “those are synonyms”
But what if I don’t hear the honking or see you outside ?
"So you have a movie for me?"  One of the happiest things to hear
Think anyone will make a supercut of just the Matt Smith scenes? Would probably make more sense split from the movie and let me watch the only part I care about.
Lol I’m just watching this instead of the movie because I have no interest in going to the theaters to watch it
I was honestly surprised that Ryan didn't mention how they became best friends for life after literally less than 3 minutes of interaction. I thought for sure this is going to be in the pitch meeting while I was watching the film😔
So the commercials alone had me not wanting to see this movie, but holy crap, I had no idea it was going to be THIS bad, lol.
At UCLA way back when, the marketing director for Ang Lee's version of The Hulk gave a talk where he was positively giddy and downright proud that his marketing campaign drove that movie to a huge opening weekend, even though it had a horrible fall the second weekend (and currently has a 29% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.)  So, yeah, I can sadly confirm that ""Kinda feels like False Advertising"/"Yeah, let's do some of that, that sounds great" is legit a real-world strategy at the studio level. 0_o
Pitch meeting Blade so you can bring up the morbius deleted scene. Itll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.   If youve already done it, do it again but just tack on morbius at the end as a post credit bit.
Poor Jared
I never heard the honk...
I can't believe anyone actually went to see this movie. This is hilarious to watch.
Blood sound effects EVERYWHERE! Nice.
For those who haven't seen the movie, everything he says about Vulture is his verbatim dialogue in the movie
You are so funny.  I think you hit EVERY criticism I've heard of this movie too...
Morbius is what you would get if batman was owned by Marvel
Cop: "Enough! Stop!" Morbius: _hands himself over_ Cop: "Wow, can't believe that worked."
“Those are synonyms”. I absolutely lost it lol
I wish so fucking much that Jared Leto was held accountable for how he treated his co stars in suicide squad.
Can you make Army Swiss man pitch meeting?
What kinda bats you been looking at…?  There’s gonna be blood everywhere  PG-13 There will be blood sound effects and everywhere!
Yeah I pretty much watch the Pitch Meeting for movies I know I am not going to pay to see in theaters. No regrets.
BEST PITCH EVER!!!!!
You should do Matilda.
I watched Blade last night. I love the Blade movies. There are three Blade movies. Please do the Blade movies. I would like you to do all three Blade movies. Thank you.
- So, do you have a movie for me? - Kinda! - How come? - I just throw in a bunch of ideas, scenes and dialogues and came up with this. It's better than writing a screenplay, I decided. - Well, it's gonna be hard to keep plot coerency and character consistence through the movie! - Actually, it's gonna be easy, barelly an inconvenience. - Ow, really? - Yeah, I just need the audience to get aaaall the way off of my back with that thing!
F***! It's 3:20!!! I missed him.
ye the movie was pretty bad.  song def gave it a more hollywood feel instead.  it felt like one of the batman games.  it's cool and all but the slow frames were random and doesnt really explain the drastic color change to purple at the end.  would have been a great opportunity to go off the comic and make a reason.  villain was the best part.  something about dr who actors playing great villains
There were 666 comments before I ruined it.
I must have been really drunk because that post credits dialogue seemed so normal in the moment.
I loved this movie and I don't understand the hate
Honestly, the movie had so much potential. I see Sony wanted to make the villians look miss understood. Not to mention introducing them with their own solo movies is a good way to set up the Sinister Six in my opinion. The problem is Sony tried to make Morbius seem like a good guy rather then a miss understood guy towards the end of the movie. Lets not ignore how they randomly grabbed Vulture and didnt give him a sensable good reason to hate Spiderman. Sony is out here messing up the universe that hasnt even started yet.
I saw this opening night, and throughout the whole movie I kept thinking "This is going to make a great Pitch Meeting"
Watching the morbius pitch meeting instead of watching the movie is tight
I like how they didn't even question why the cargo ship at the beginning would be staffed exclusively by mercenaries, or that they would be armed douchebags inadvertently kicking off the whole "man on the run" plot element for no other reason than to kick off the whole "man on the run" plot element. Like this stuff is just a given.
So many perfect opportunities to get aaallllllllll the way off his back about the script hahahaha
Step Brothers pitch meeting
It's safe to subscribe again to only get the good stuff 😁
In the time it takes for a new pitch to come out I've rewatched everyother pitch from the before times... still laugh the whole way through!
1:38 PG 13 😂😂😂😂
Synthetic blood sucking bats are tight.. skinny jeans tight.. tight..
I can tell from the passion shown in this pitch meeting that it was obvious from the start this would be the first movie to sell 1 trillion tickets.
Am I the only one who enjoyed this movie?  Edit: clearly
This is the only version of this thing that I wanted to watch. Thank you Ryan
Screenwriter Guy:This film will do just fi... Me smashing through the door.  Me:Cancel that film!
This movie left me so empty, I was sitting in the theater the whole time thinking WOW WOW WOW.  Do the movie Red.
so glad I don't have to watch bad movies but still be caught up because of pitch meetings.
first
PG-13 gets me every time.
I enjoyed the movie, just not the post credit scenes
Thank you for saving others 3 hours of crapshow, Ryan!  I actually had to endure this film dreck.  Kept looking at my watch waiting for it to end my suffering..
THANK YOU RYAN PLEASE DO ROADHOUSE
Pitch meeting higher box office opening week than morbius
Okay so we can all agree Morbius is a masterpiece
Calvin Klein bat abs.  OMG!!?🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pitch meeting for Tropic Thunder!
I skipped the movie and watched Pitch Meeting instead. I'm pretty sure the movie became much more enjoyable this way.
Went to see this movie on release day. last movie I'll ever have to see.
I can’t even express how stupid the “I am venom” line really is.
But Ryan it's 4:00pm April 7 2021 and your STILL NOT HERE..... WHERE ARE YOU RYAN!!
This movie had a rough time. At least the pitch meeting was hilarious.
Aliens 👽 is one of my favorite movies 🎬 of all time can you do a pitch meeting for the 2nd alien 👽 movie please pretty please
It is just a reflection of the current world event
Ryan, you forgot to honk.
Heard about them making Morbius. Assumed that it would be a pile of stupid. Was protected from watching by this channel. You're the best!
The bat-khameahmeah was probably my favorite scene in the movie
Lol didnt even know this was pg13. They are killing are favourite anti heros with that shit. How can a movie about a blood drinking batdude have 0 blood? Venom all over again. Gotta get that china money
I WAS THE ONE TRILLIONTH VIEWER #MorbiusSweep
IDK man but Ryan seems more energetic now that he has his own channel
Another amazing pitch meeting, was it hard to do?
seriously is the kid still in the coma immediately next to the illegal secret lab after he stopped treating her or what 🤨
Thank you for saving me from potentially wasting a few hours of my life by watching this "movie"
Ryan didn't have to go see this movie, but he did. He did that for us. Props
Do Greenland or better yet, moonfall.... Holey moley that movie was stupid.... Hollywood is so fucking dead and buried by this point its never coming back again..
I hate how all the villains in these origin movies are just evil versions of the protagonist.
Hey guys Sony is basically in the MCU now, didja know?  :one eye twitches, for some reason:
Already at half a million subs 😂 love that
possibly best pitch meeting ever.
test on himself in international waters ? do these idiots writers dont know IW is not a free for all ? you are still under the law of either the destination country,the departure country or the country whose flag the ship is registered to
Thank god.. I don't need watching morbious by watching this
How can you spoil a movie that studio already spoiled on twitter?
so they don't actually tie in the most obvious character to tie in here: Blade i guess cuz they don't own the character or something
probably wont watch this crap movie anyways
"Kind of like that line from that other thing." LOL
Also vulture didn't make the suit that was thinkerer and his team
I don't care about the spoiler warning
The gift that keeps on giving
"Now he's JACKED and muscular, you know like a bat!" "What kind of bats have you been looking at?"  😏
**Spoilers ahead!** Yea no one cares.
Wow
Can’t wait for lady Morbius, when she turns into a vampire she gets DD tatas and has to drink blood or goes back to AA Tatas.
I am proud of myself for not knowing that this movie existed
Hi, Ryan! I know that you probably already got tons of requests for this animated film, but I'm going to ask for it anyway. Please make an Encanto Pitch Meeting video. 🙏🏾💻🎧📱 Thanks so much for making everyone laugh each week! We really appreciate you and your hard work! 💖
Hi Ryans we Dudeists think a pitch meeting for The Big Lebowski would be far out, man and if you could wear the Dude's cardigan that would be marvellous.
He should do one with Patch Adams.
Ryan you should watch RRR. It's amazing.
Even pitch meetings couldn’t save this movie 🤣🤣
I actually liked Morbius for the most part.
Please do The Bad Guys later
An entire pitch meeting could be dedicated to The post credit scene alone. It was just so bad.
"Those are synonyms..."
Wow wow wow
I wanna watch this movie so bad despite any negativity hitting that movie right now
Oh, so friend/business colleague acquires the same powers as the protagonist and turns evil and they have to have a huge battle. How very original.
It's super power originy, barely an inconvenience.
You can easily read the IQs of people judging their reaction to this movie.
Man, that movie seriously sucked.
The only bat that is ripped like that is BATman. I'm surprised no jokes were made with Batman, considering they are both bat themed, dark and brooding superhero movies that came out back to back
I cannot stress enough how much the eye twitch joke made me laugh.
This movie was a bad acid trip with Jared Leto.
Does it ever occur to studios that try to make vampire films that animal blood could be used as a substitute for human blood? I mean, how different is the blood of a cow or a pig from a human? I reckon it can't be too different, since it's still coming from a warm-blooded mammal.
Give us a Ninja Turtles episode!
Do pitch meetings of old Godzilla movies! That would be *TIGHT*
What a crazy as duck movie.
Surely the woke message should be that he starts out jacked  aka body shaming physique that the average man cant obtain & then turns into the pale skinny physique or even better, a fat saggy man bod when he gains his powers. I feel super body conscious now.
"That kind of sounds like false advertising" "Yeah let's do some of that, that sounds great"  The accuracy in these meetings is stunning!
Okay, but look, I non-ironically liked this movie... but then again, I non-ironically liked the first Suicide Squad, so I guess I'm just a sucker for bad superhero movies with Jared Leto
you got me at blood sound effects everywhere, the most accurate description of this  mess of a movie, well done ryan BRAVO
1:20 Screenwriter Guy is gay, I decided.
Dude there's 3 already where are you?
Okay look, I know you're not REALLY picking me up at three but I'll be keeping an ear out for honking just in case ~ヾ(￣▽￣)
Jared Leto can't wait for the ICU (Image Cinematic Universe) to kick off and redeem himself...
DO LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS!!!!! Please do LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS
It's always a Damn Good Day when this Nerd Explains movies to me.
"Yeees. Hamfisted it was."
This has to be the real pitch meeting 😆
Y'know what could be fun, pitch meetings for pre-PG-13 PG movies. Or G, like The Planet of the Apes series.
Rip story line about the little girl in coma
Pitch meeting is a great way to keep up with movies I have no plans to watch
Thanks Ryan. The movie is still not out in movie theaters for some reason and it’s nice to watch it as a pitch meeting
Gd that's spot on!
Jared Leto. Please stop being in movies!
Oh yeah i legit forgot that Milo shoukd also be able to control the bats
One day the answer to "is that going to be hard to do?" Is going to be "yes, it's super hard, extremely inconvenient"
Jagred Letto is Batman??? Something in The Way!
Spoiler warning! Just kidding. Wont see it.
Craziest part of the movie was about halfway in when Morbius screams the N-Word at the top of his lungs at a mercenary before flying away and it’s crazy none of you can dispute that because nobody here has actually seen the entire movie
"But with one eye twitching..."  Twitches both eyes in response to show that he's doubly in the know.
I do not know why this film got such a low score on Rotten Tomatoes but Suicide Squad got a higher score - nani?!!
Please do a pitch meeting for the 2017 and 2021 My Little Pony movies
Jared Leto is so unlucky man...
1:57. ohhh having the same vampire problems as Blade is TIGHT!
Chronicles of Vladimir Tod. That was the book (only read the first one) series I was thinking of with drinking out of a blood bag. In the book, if I remember correctly, the vampire kid has an aunt/grandma/something like that working at a blood bank, and his favorite is O+ I think. Meanwhile me hearing about how blood is constantly in short supply (I get texts saying so to donate due to this) so it should be harder for her to smuggle some out for her nephew/whatever to eat.
Marvel: "Can we cast Tobey and Andrew in No Way Home?" Sony: "No" Marvel: "Please?" Sony: "Fine, but we want Michael Keaton in Morbius" Marvel: "Lol okay 🤣🤣🤣"
I was scared this movie wasnt good when they didn't release a soundtrack xD they just said lets borrow from batman begins xD
"To bats, it's lethal. To humans, it's deadly."  To chickens, it's fatal. To horses, it's destructive. To crabs, it's ruinous. To pandas, it's toxic. To salmons, it's poisonous. To gorillas, it's calamitous.
I liked the movie
I have never cared less about spoilers IN MY LIFE!   This one's gonna be good I can feel it
I’m gonna get hate for this but I actually liked the movie. It wasn’t great by any means and yeah it had a lot of flaws. But it’s NOWHERE near as bad as people make it out to be
I’ve seen the film and I enjoyed it. But its true Sony without Disney is shit ( the amazing Spider-Man series ).
Dr STRANGE spells in MORBIUS?    Thats STRANGE !!! But what the hell....
I know it said spoiler but apparently the story is so forgettable that I couldn't tell you what happens after a 7 minute recap
I completely forgot about that Induced coma that never been concluded lol
Was anyone really surprised this movie sucked?
I decided to watch this even though I haven't seen the movie I decided. I don't feel like it was spoiled at all. They must really not be a lot going on in this thing
The Ryanverse saves us once again from movies we don’t want to see
I have been laughing continuously cuz it's very funny even the forget button line well done Ryan .
I had good hopes for this movie but for what I have heard... lets just save some money
I strongly dislike Jared Leto and I don't know why. He's done nothing wrong to me but I feel very hostile towards his career.
Yeah, this saved me a ticket purchase.
Ripped bat guy the enemy of ripped spider guy
This one is gold. Morbius was so badly written, it was bound to work better as a pitch meeting
Peacemaker next let's go
So Dr. Michael Morbius will have to drink real human blood but doesn't want to kill or hurt anyone.  You'd think he'd know about something called "Blood Banks".
No more, Jared Leto comic book movie, please for the love of god
I'd love to see a Pitch Meeting for "2001-A Space Odyssey"
Ninja Turtles 1 & 2 (90's one, not the Megan Fox one)
I would rather pay money to watch this 7 minute pitch meeting than pay for a ticket to Morbius.
Dude it's way past 3, where the hell are you?
Hey when you come pick me up, can you bring a better movie with you?
I hope this channel is rewarding Ryan good
Well this has saved me £12.50.
I want to see a pitch meeting for "The Neverending Story," one of the absolute worst and nonsensical movies I have ever seen.  It traumatized my childhood
41 minute crew        Perceived 558th comment
This makes me happy that I haven't even seen the trailer lol
He’s gonna tear these guys apart blood everywhere   “PG-13”  There will be blood sound effects everywhere!”
its not gonna be a pitch meeting if it doesnt have the words super easy barely an enconvinience
I'd love to see a pitch meeting for Tangled or How to train your dragon!<3
I knew the reviews were bad - but wow, just the summary alone saved me from this. I read the Roy Thomas treatment back in the day in the comics and thought it was brilliant and then thought - how can Sony mess this up - easy they are Sony.
I love that … “you keep referencing things that happened in earlier scenes; you don’t need to do that.”
I ❤️ you, Ryan🥰
It’s like Hollywood is incapable of learning from their mistakes. They got Jared Leto to make the same bonehead movie twice… If in Suicide Squad you made Batman your villain it would have been intriguing. If in Morbius you made Spiderman your villain it would have been hilarious but nope… Hollywood is too high on children’s blood to think straight… ever… Anyway, Please make a Pitch Meeting for Welcome to Raccoon City
The way he said "those are synonyms" makes me think he felt proud of himself for knowing that and that the writers of Morbius seem to not.
I can't do this part vampire bat thing 😂 when the camera’s not on, you just see him chilling in random farmers' barns sucking in cows' feet
It was still a better movie than the Batman hands down
😂 "Those are synonyms."
Algorithm comment
Guyver 1992 - Mark Hammil
The only place I come to for spoilers
It's 3:54, Ryan, you're LATE! AGAIN! .... Jeez, man, do you wanna bet the boba or not!?
4:38  *sewer count: 196*
Next one please: The Village, Midsomma or G.I.Jane
Didn't even need to put the "spoilers ahead" for this one.
I liked this movie
do a pitch meeting on drive
Could you do a pitch meeting of Zombieland?
Screenwriter: "There's gonna be blood everywhere!" Producer: "PG-13." Screenwriter: "There's gonna be blood sound effects everywhere!" 😂🤣
Yet another movie where they for some odd reason...try to cram Jared Leto down our throats...after every movie he is in bombs lol
They straight up lied in most of the trailers and marketing material. Sony is really out of their mind and are just so blatantly leeching off the MCU.
an origin story with sudden abs for no reason and a vilain with the exact same powers as the hero, yup, that's a marvel movie.
Good god  I’m glad I didn’t buy this movie
I am convinced that trolls made the audience score super high. It's such an incredibly bad movie xD
Ryan it's past three and I haven't heard a single honk
This movie was TIGHT ''PG-13'' This movie was NICE
intriguing. .. no no it's not!
Literally just saw this movie last. Nite and was thinking bout the pitch.
aside from the terrible script, you can tell they didnt let jared leto be jared leto. hes so bland lmfao
4:47 That's the name of that mango!
So this movie is basically Sony being sad that they gave Spiderman to Disney? I guess they shoulda thought that before they decided to throw Amazing Spiderman in the garbage :P
Morbius sounds like aa dumpster fire in an active volcano. I can't wait to see it so I can share the pain you must have gone through to sit through it.
It's clear Ryan put much more effort into this pitch meeting than the director put into Morbius
How the hell do you make these so fast?
maybe Sony should just ask to be purchased by Disney.
So, Comments are now regulated by guidelines ... We're practically in Disney now.
Morbius ...sounds more like More-BS 😂
Anyone else unsub from screen rant?
I saw this movie opening night, and it was… just ok
"those are synonyms" XD
They probably put Pitch Meeting on their own youtube channel because people went to the old channel just to find Pitch Meetings lol. Now finding Pitch Meetings is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
How about the original The Wizard of Oz movie?  There is a Wicked movie adaptation planned so it'd be funny to reflect on how this franchise began all the way back in the forties.
Jared Leto is a good actor, but is somehow always hamstrung by script, editing, or timing. Guy can't catch a break.
Insightful breakdowns mixed with cutting satire, my favourite two for one. Loving post screen rant pitch meetings.
Spoilers? Like anyone would care if this movie got spoiled for them lol
#Morbiussweep
Vampire movies without blood are tight
The way you describe these movies is too perfect lol
Oh, Sony is hanging onto this intellectual property TIGHT!
So all that Vulture stuff.. is that actually word for word or is it a little exaggerated.?   Edit: I cannot believe Vulture's dialogue is exactly word for word what Ryan said in this video. I simply cannot wrap my mind around that.
I have the movie a more positive review cause I was just relieved it was out in theaters.
Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Save us from having to actually watch that one as well.
The synonyms line got me
‘That’s from a previous scene’  hahaha dude you still keep these funny and fresh after all these years. Keep up the good work man!
"those are synonyms" lol
I was hoping for a mention of him being interviewed by Fubuki.
Morbious is not a villian? or this is again a Venon type case, where they skip the evil origins again to just make another hero movie?
I F N love theses
I think Jared Leto has reached his sell-by date.
Morbius would die if he got as much sun as... I wanna say Ryan?
Wow, it's so awesome.  Hey Everyone! Did you know Sony is Basically part of the MCU now? So awesome.🤦‍♂️ 😄👍
Now Jared Letto has the worst DC and Marvel movies under his name
VAMPIRES are TIGHT !!!  Wheres BLADE?
If I'm getting the right gist, constant pausing by the script writers helped to distract from the awfulness of this movie.  A somewhat refreshing change from ruining good movies to nitpick the hell out of them. :)
"...pretty much every scene is a clean slate here!"😂😂😂
Super easy barely an inconvenience
I hate pitch meetings, because now I watch all movies noticing all plot holes thinking how writer guy is going to pitch it hahaha. Keep up the good work Ryan, you are definitely 1 of my favorite YouTubers! Love and Blessings from South Africa🇿🇦✌️
This went by as fast as the movie runtime
Thanks Ryan for keeping me alive
This is new Twilight.
👴🏾: Gather round children and let me tell you about when Pitch Meeting use to be on Screen Rants.  👨🏽‍⚕️: Come on dad stop boring this kids with your old fairy tales.  👴🏾: It's true I swear.
3:33  haven't you seen *Reservior Dogs?*  Whenever you want a secretive meeting with criminals or men/women/things on the run, falsely accused of a crime they didn't commit, _always_ meet in a coffee shop or diner, drive-in or dive because the servers aren't getting paid enough to deal with your shit, much less rat you out.  Unless the cops tip well.  Then you're screwed.    I'm looking at you, Mr. Pink!
Forget the what button? I already forgot what you said, Ryan.
These are pure gold, don't ever quit!
"Spoilers Ahead"      Don't worry, we ain't watching it anyway. lol
Ocean's 11,12,13 pleasee
Maybe I'll get that Fury Road pitch meeting on this channel...
I like how at the end Producer guy is just telling him to add a bunch of nonsense and Screenwriter guy who he himself also wrote nonsense is telling him that it makes no sense
I can't believe the Vulture scene is real lmao
He has abs...like a bat. Oh so that's why Batman is so ripped! He must have gotten the idea from bats.
Ryan is on 🔥🔥🔥
0:01 Spoiler warnings are to not spoil GOOD twists and plot details, but in this case they're terrible so spoilers are harmless. Anyone else agrees? Lol
So many people hating on this movie and the end credit scene. If you go in with the same expectations as iron man and captain America? Sure misses the mark, but this is a C list hero and is setting up a C list hero group the dark avengers. ( which is what the vulture scene is about)
Here is how to make the movie better and more connected Morbious is stopped by amazing spiderman for killing the guys on the dock then goes to jai he can met with Rhino or this universe version of vulture l. Spiderman makes a refrence to the time he worked with two other spidermen.
Clicking like before you even watch the video is tight.
Watership Down adaptations
Hollywood 2022: Check out our bat virus hero!!!
“Those were synonyms”
I am subscribing for this!
Please pitch "Weird Science" ... from an 80's perspective ... Please, Sir.
So we can actually have a Sony dark universe with MCU characters?  And most(if not all) movies will suck? Kinda seems like they're learning the wrong lessons from warner brothers and the DCEU
Sony needs to sell all its Marvel characters to Disney/Marvel already. They are becoming worse than Fox. Each movie they do is a bigger turd than the last.
3 is a little early my guy I won't be ready by then, if you're cool waiting in your car otherwise you can come in and get a snack or something
The movie does explain why Milo is a bad version. Just without dialogue. It does very well actually.
"Very exciting" No, not really.
Ryan, I'm so sorry you had to sit through the movie to make this video. Thank you for your sacrifice.
I can’t understand the unreasonable level of hate towards this movie. I really did like it more than I thought I did. Flaws and all.
False advertising yeah let's do some of that
"What kind of bats have you been looking at?" 🤣🤣🤣
Kinda surprised he didn't mention the classic marvel formula of the bad guy having similar/same powers as the hero
Ryan george single handedly destroying the Hollywood movie market by givibg me all the reasons not to watch anything, all for free. like, subscribe, and protecc him at all costs
1000 View average every 1 minute is great! Keep up the videos man we are here for YOU!
These type of films are getting more inane by the minute.
If there hadn’t been memes about how terrible this movie is then I wouldn’t have even known it existed lol
After hearing the ending, I want some of that serum.
here before he posts cringie shorts about false advertising and post credit scenes
Im really excited to see what he can complain about in this masterpiece
Thanks Sony. Gooood job. 👍
Who else likes the video before watching the pitch meeting.
"well if you put it that way...." kind of movie .
Anyone else watching this without watching the movie?
I liked it.
Sony should do a Green Goblin origin movie
As soon as I saw the thumbnail all I could think is "Stop, stop, he's already dead!"
Andrew:   "I wanna fight a Vampire in a movie."   Sony:   "And you shall! But first... we're gonna put some dirt in your eye."
Stop with the googly eyes. It’s annoying
Wow, can't wait to see this comedic take on the greatest movie of all time #morbiussweep
I actually think this is very accurate.
I imagine Ryan George sitting in the theater shaking his head and chuckling to himself as he's scribbling down notes for Pitch Meeting.
"So then Morbuis kills a bunch of mercenaries that work for him" "Oh so he's a bad guy" "No, they're just mercenaries so it's ok that they died" "Oh, well we should repeatedly have people say that it's ok to kill mercenaries, so we know killing those guys is ok" "Yea yeah yeah"
Such a shame. I was initially hyped to see this movie. Sounds like it's not even worth my time. I've been rooting for Jared since Suicide Squad (I was intrigued by his joker and wanted to see more to have a fair enough assessment. The Snyder League redeemed it in my eyes) and thought he got shafted because of the studio.
Can we get a Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters Pitch Meeting, please 🥺
Guys he actually honked at 3
They did a great job hiding the fact that this isn’t actually an MCU movie
this was better than the movie
I'm glad ya'll moved these to their own channel. Screen rant sucks
This review would have a higher score on the tomatometer as a movie of its own.
The movie could have had a good ending if they had add blade in it. If they had made the black cop turn out to be blade. Like if blade would have showed up at the end instead of the bats and then blade helps mobes to kill his friend then they could have had blade tell him that he could train him and in a post credit scene have blade be teleport to the MCU this way when vulture comes to mobes and tell him that it might be spider man's fault for blade being Taken from him this would have made mobes angry with spider man which would have made him a real good bad guy for spider man to fight in a later movie
"So he feels bad about killing all those people, so he sends a distress call and tells the authorities that there's a ship 13 miles off the coast that needs help." "Smart." "Yeah, so then he grabs his stuff and jumps into the water." "Jumps into the water?  Does he have a lifeboat or something." "Nope, he just kind of...just kind of jumps." "Is he going to swim the 13 miles back to shore?" "Well, see, he's a vampire now, so he's super strong." "So one of his vampire powers is he's really good at swimming?" "Yeah, sure." "Does he know he can do that?" "Yeah, sure." "Okay, I guess that makes sense." "Maybe.  So then..."
I refuse to buy a ticket so this is how I’m watching this movie
Hei where is Peacemaker TV Series pich meeting??
*Pitch Meeting for TRON (1982), please, please, PLEASE, puh-LEEEEEEEEEASE!* 😁😁😁
Morbius was easily the greatest film I have ever seen
Ahhhahaaha
hey there, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK next please
I know this is just ScreenRant’s second channel, so I’m still indirectly funding their nonsense, but it’s so good to have these on their own and none of the other rubbish clogging my feed.
I like how he has a bunch of bags of human blood in his lab, but they aren't a solution & he'll have to kill people because reasons.
This saves me the 2 hours when It finally comes out on Netflix or smth. THX!
Knowing he sat through this movie to provide this for us makes my respect for Ryan even higher
Lol i haven't watch the movie yet, but here i am
Doing Highlander movie pitch meetings would be super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Literally never heard of this movie until now
But why does he staff his science boat with a heavily armed mercenary team, why does a Nobel prize winning scientist lock himself in a glass box with all his blood on the outside and have to desperately beg to be let out by his friend? WHY DOES THE COP SHAKE THE LITTER TRAY!!!!  I never noticed about the girl in the coma though, good spot!
Do The Adam Project!
4:00 hmm
"Those are synonyms..." made me spit-take.
He saw this, for us…what a hero.
Watching the pitch meeting for Morbius without having to watch the movie is tight!
I love how they take turns implying how ridiculous the other's idea is.
Writer Guy: You keep referencing things characters that are said previously in the movie, you don't have to do that.  Also writer Guy references previous MCU movies.
That poor Jared Leto really isn't good a picking movie roles...
All the scenes with Vulture are so problematic despite being so few AND HOW THE F*CK DOES MORBIUS KNOW VENOMS NAME?
2:18 holy sh*t that's the doctor!
👍👍👍
Movie definitely suffered from the delays. Wasn't as bad as people were saying. Was good enough by the numbers super hero movie. End credit scenes were the worst part. Matt Smith was really entertaining. Also no giant space beam.
Please do a pitch meeting for the HBO show "Euphoria"! That would be tight! 🙏
Love the new channel, excited to see it grow
I actually saw this bad film.  Whoopsie.   Whoopsie.
Fucking Jared Leto...I was excited to hear about Tron 3 until I learned he was gonna be in it too.
Imo Morbius is like any other super hero movie with all of the exact same movie tropes and cliches, but I don't know why this one got so many backlash.
Yeah why not lol 😂
So we're not gonna mention that awkward dance scene that Milo does in the movie 😅?
*Why aren't you gonna do a pitch meeting for the movie "Idiocracy"?*
Underwear model 🤣🤣
So he's like "I'm turning into a vampire, I'm gonna kill people I gotta die" and "No I'm not gonna cure your lethal disease, being really strong, fast and literally superhuman is a curse cause when I get resistant to this synthetic blood I'll need to take real human blood which the ONLY way to do that is by killing people, so I'm not gonna let you do what I did to survive"  Like....... I mean..... Does he not know we figured out how to put blood in bags? Are we sure this guy's a doctor?
Ryan George, the only guy who can make a sentence like "those are synonyms" sound funny
So many of these jokes were just on point 😂
Thank you for watching this so I don't have to
"...what bats have you been looking at lately, Mr. Writer?"  "Ah, easy: The Gotham bat."  "The Gotham bat?"  "Yeah. Ripped and vaguely Anglo humanoid, has a butler, moody and likes Nirvana. Quite rare."  "Wow wow wow... _wow!_ "
I don't know why musical artists always want to become actors. Stick to what you're good at even if you are thirsty for attention
This is the movie ever
Hmmm a movie in post-2020 times about mixing bat dna with human dna…yes, let’s do that
“Those are synonyms.”  Gold.
"What kind of bats are you looking at?" LOL
- because they're both attractive - That's the whole love interest build up?
3h37 still waiting... Great video though
“Those are synonyms.”  Gold.
nooooooooooooooooooo comic books
I haven't seen Morbius and don't plan to, but Ryan always makes movies better.
Jared Leto is an amazing actor. Unfortunately, he's been on a Nicolas Cage streak of picking bad movies to star in.
Thank you so much, now I don't need to waste my money on going to see it haha
Haha that shade at sony at the start was perfectly played.
What a horrendous piece of shit movie and Jared leto does not disappoint
I’m looking forward to the Pitch Meetings for Ambulance, Sonic 2, and Everything Everywhere All At Once.
Yo Pitch Meeting guys, why don't you twins make a Pitch Meeting for "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", should be super easy, barely an inconvenience
only channel i will watch the ads for.
Curious, Anyone else unsubscribe to screen rant the minute this channel put up it's first episode?
So what does Morbius do when Milo regenerates?
"No, not even worth the effort" is a pretty good slogan for all Sony's marvel movies that don't have "Spiderverse" in the title.
Producer Guy: What kind of bats you're looking at? *Writer Guy looks at his posters of jacked Robert Pattinson, Ben Affleck and Christian Bale*
“You know how the MCU is at least self confident and doesn’t need to reference its other IPs all the time? We have no such confidence.”
LMAO "I'll pick u up at 3"
Ryan it’s 3:30 where are you
Poor Morbius... But, hey, if COVID taught us one thing it's that mixing human and bat DNA leads to empty movie theaters...
"How did X happen?"  "I DON'T KNOW.  and I'm gonna need you to get ALL the WAY OFF MY BACK about this."  "Super easy, barely, an inconvenience.  My bad."
Interstellar pitch meeting pls
I really want a Bay Turtles pitch
I love this pitch meeting but I still want to watch the movie 😆 😆 also you should do the mummy with Brendan Frasier
Ryan can't squint?
How about ambulance? I'd like to see a pitch meeting of that or that channing tatum movie
Do Turning Red
Why couldn’t he just go to a blood bank don’t get human blood?
I didn't notice the spiderman poster at all.
I'll be waiting at 3PM. If you don't show ill wait a while.
This movie seems an amazing roller coaster of nonsense.
Anyone else notice that Milo doesn't take a vial? I was watching close, thinking that was his plan, then he walked out and we saw a split second of both vials, still on the table. Was thinking they'd say maybe he got some of Michaels blood on a wound or something, but not they said he took something when he did not... should've caught that in editing maybe. Hate to admit, that took me out of the movie really early on
It’s half past 3 and Ryan still hasn’t come to pick me up 😢 I think he forgot
Everything you make is just amazing  👏 never disappoints glad pitch meetings got its own channel
Those are synonyms...😭😂
Ryan George and Pitch Meetings are TIGHT!
George Ryan should play Multiple Man in the X-men movie.
dude, it's like 3:30pm now - you coming through or what? not chill to keep a brother waiting    (ref: 7:01)
I'm counting this as me actually seeing the movie
The fact that nobody wake me up when i slept in the theater i spent 5 hours sleeping
This was so good! Thank you for this 🙂!
Thank you for your sacrifice of watching this terrible movie so we don't have to.
1:34 too bad its still 15 in the us
Wow wow wow...wow.
Dude it's 2:30 if someone honks at 3 I'll know it is you!
Can you do Sonic 2 next?
Can you do a Pitch Meeting for Vivo???
1:58 Sounds like Blade?...It's Blade! Right?
"There's gonna be blood everywhere." "PG-13." "There's gonna be blood sound effects everywhere." "Nice." The process of every comic book adaptation.
I don't know why did you include "Spoilers Ahead" , it's not like Everyone want to  watch it!!
"Hey, let's go see that new Jared Leto movie!" said nobody. Ever.
"How did he know she was getting on the bus and get on before her?" "His best friend is the doctor from doctor who, sir"
Jesus, what a dumpster fire of a movie
pitching poorly-conceived comic movies about characters no one cares about is TIGHT!
Oh no I wasn’t going to see it anyway
It would be nice to see him joking about Disney's Bolt.
Leto is a good actor.  Why does he keep getting these shite scripts?  He needs to fire his manager or read the scripts first.
Its just SUPER lazy writing when the bad guy has the exact same powers as the good guy, but is just bad. You should bring this up in the next superhero movie. Almost every single Marvel movie is like this.
There is so much content to see/view nowadays. THIS will be the way I SEE them ALL. Barely an inconvenience.
I feel like Morbius is just the edgy teen movie
This was gold! You should pitch the defenders saga and the blade trilogy next!
I really wish people would stop giving Jared Leto's goofy, wanna-be-Cult-Leader ass work.
Intro: "Spoilers ahead."  Me: "It's Morbius, who gives a shit?"
The first thumbnail from Ryan's Pitche Meeting's which made me more scared of Morbius than the actual Morbius in the movie
It has a 70% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes
Fingers crossed Blade just kills Morbius so it doesn’t go any further lol
Ive said it before, and Imma say it again, love this guy, love his content, now move all the pitch meetings over to this channel so I dont have to keep watching Screen Rant
This is a first, more people will actually watch this video than Morbius in theaters. Guaranteed.
Finally, the best content on YouTube
"Blood everywhere!" "PG-13" "Blood sound effects everywhere!" 😂😂 lost it
Free Guy and Dune!!!
PRODUCER: How'd the FBI Get up on the roof so fast? WRITER: Well sir I was thinking we could get Tyrese Gibson from the fast and the furious movies to play this character. PRODUCER: Ohhhh so he's fast because he was in a movie series all about going fast in cars. WRITER: Makes about as much sense as most of the rest of what I wrote in this script, especially the part where it only happens that one time I want it to and is forgotten every other time.
I liked that movie. I actually want to see it again.
I actually liked the Morbius movie
Pick me up at 3? But I was still working, and it was 15 minutes before you released the video.
Suffering through the movie so we don't have to.  Not all heroes wear capes.
I literally just walked out of the theater after seeing this movie (which I didn't *hate*), and this is the first thing that popped up on YouTube.  Beautiful.  The whole time I was watching it, I was thinking "this will make a GREAT pitch meeting."
when you dont care being spoiled about the movie, so you just watch the pitch meeting to feel like you watched it.
Ohh yeah. This channel was a great idea.
Hey Ryan - would love to see a Pitch Meeting for Tropic Thunder!
Oh, Jared Leto is TIGHT!
"What kind of bats have you been looking at?" "... Batman?" "We don't own that." "Whoopsie!"
Finally being able to unsubscribe from screen rant is TIGHT.
Please do Better Call Saul after the series wraps up.
Pitch meet shrek
Please do a Pitch Meeting for the movie "North".
We all knew this was coming 😂.
You should definitely do one of these for The Son of the Mask. I don't think I have ever watched anything more god awful than that in my entire life. Hahahahaha...
This movie is a black hole of originality and logic; I also really loved it despite or possibly because of that
sonic 2 pls
Ryan said he’d pick us up at 3 but this video didn’t get posted till like 3:15 ET. Sony must have devised the logic for this meet-up time.
GREMLINS
I just knew this movie was gonna have its own Pitch Meeting
Hey, you got any of them jacked bats to share?
I think you should do snake eyes next or one of the other GI Joe movies. So you have a movie for me? Yes sir I do, I was thinking we could do an origin movie on snake eyes from G.I. Joe Oh cool so expand on his life as a child as he becomes a ninja and joins the Joe team? No I was thinking we make a completely different movie But won’t fans be expecting it to be part of the other movies? I’m gonna need you to get all the way off my back about this
Just pausing the video to say that I hate the physique that Morbius has.  He should be lean with wiry not bulky
Watching Pitch Meetings for movies I was never planning to watch is TIGHT!
Love your videos Please do a good movie like Pulp Fiction next!
Yeap, i'm skipping this movie
Steven Grant have more blood in his hand on Ep 1 than the this whole movie...
Pinning this comment is Super easy, barely an inconvinience
Do American Psycho
another movie where the villain is just an evil version of the main character
Ooooooh Im Ready For This One
Ryan, publishes a Pitch meeting, ten minutes later, nearly one hundred comments. If that's not a committed fanbase I don't know what is.
If Jared Leto doesn't have a "Bloodthirsty" tattoo on his forehead, I'm not watching this movie.
Ok it’s 3:30 where are you Ryan
At this point I'm more excited about the Pitch Meetings than the actual movies.
Kino.
When the movie is so terribly flawed and you haven't seen it and start wondering whether he's just making a joke or did that actually happen in the movie
Jared Leto needs to retire from what he calls "acting."
Sony: "Gene splicing is tight!" Mewtwo: "I agree."
Sometimes I ask myself who's to blame for movies like these... The writer for adding a bunch of nonsense or the producer for adding even more nonsense?
Pitch Meeting sticking it to sh***y movies is tight!
Honestly, the movie doesn't even sound that bad it just sounds boring.
0 hour gang!
I like how both the Writer and the Producer keep saying, "We're allowed to do that," to each other, and both of them react to the other as if that's a stupid idea.  Also, "What kind of bats have you been looking at?" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Poor Jared.... he "is" a good actor but damn. Just can't catch a break I guess.
so he's a bat man,man bat? because that's what I just heard.
Watching another pitch meeting super easy
Sony-Marvel might have taken Batman a bit too literal.
Why are we still here... Just to suffer.
The post-credit scene was just like the one in Iron Man. Except, you know, much much worse.
I'm telling you now Morbius will have its own Bring back the Snyder cut, I got delayed like 10 times and I'm assuming it was actually good before that
Not even kidding, this pitch meeting moved at the same pace as the Movie
Do sonic 2 please
To bats this video is narrow, to humans it's *tight* !
I'm watching this instead of watching the actual movie...I think that means something.
1:55 - Missed opportunity for Bat - Pack
I dont even watch these movies.
This video is better then the film itself
😂😂
Good thing I decided not to waste my money on theaters for this, judging by the general impressions I have read about. And to confirm my reservations, before I even started watching this meeting, I read the description. How the hell can a vampire flick not have any blood?!
Well that’s a terrifying thumbnail
Spoiling myself with Morbius so I cant see the Movie is Super Easy Barely an Inconvenience
The Princess Bride Pitch Meeting would be super easy, barely an inconceivable.  Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ummm, never mind Fair enough. Anyway, this movie is so perfect for this format that it is inconceivable.  Hold on. Did you say inconceivable, again? Yeah, why? Well, you keep using that word. I do not think that it means what you think it means. I'm gonna need you to get all the way off of my back about that. Let me get off of that thing. Thanks Not knowing what things mean when you say them is tight.  Yeah, it is.
🤣🤣🤣
Screenwriter: So, we have the chance to make a cool vampire anti-hero, all we need is some blood and- Producer: Did you say blood? Screenwriter: Uhm, yes.  But not that much it just establishes a more realistic sett- Producer: Nope. Can't do blood.  We've killed everyone without blood thus far, we gotta keep the streak going Screenwriter: But- Producer: No blood.
Thanks for saving me from having to watch that!  Also, the laughing
Pitch meeting channel, the house that “bats built?”
I think Screen writer guy is sexually attracted to bats.
Lets just pretend we are Marvel buy we're not actually Marvel .. Morbius
Ryan please do Jumper 2008 🙌
you know like a bat 😂😂
Unsubscribing from Screenrant was *tight*
Classic
it was the kamehameha with bats for me
When the shady guy with a personal connection to you suddenly wants the same technology or power that you have 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
10 seconds in and this is already better than all of Morbius.
This videos. Where the only reason I had  screen rant. On my subscriptions
'There's going to be blood everywhere' 'PG 13' 'There's going to be blood sound effects everywhere'
American History X
Please do Air Bud next
Yes. The irony that company (Sony) is in a verge of becoming subsidiary to (Marvel Studios) other company they literally saved from annihilation. Is delicious
I love this, Morbius was trash, and this proves it
It’s nice to see Laurence Fishburne’s character in The Matrix get a stand-alone sequel
Thank you for saving us from hacky shi
I haven’t seen Morbius. Don’t really plan on seeing it so I’ll just watch the pitch meeting instead.
Please do back to the future 2 n 3 pitch please
I want to know what kind of bats scriptwriting guy is looking at, though
It really makes you feel like a vampire. A little something for everybody, 9/10.
4 mins ago this vid was uploaded and already 3.5k views wow wow wow....wow
Sitting in Costa drinking a skinny latte when your supposed to be in hiding is tight !
Thank you somebody mentioned the Kamehameha he did
you should've never said Spoilers Ahead
"Spoilers ahead"... as if anyone was watching Morbius... 😅
Morbius is the most ever its unbelievably
I mean, morbius was a Spider-Man villain.
Not only is Morbius CLEARLY a part of the MCU, he's also part of The Batman universe.
This was 100000000000000X better than the movie!!!!
"Spoiler Alert"  Never planned on watching it but thanks mate.
I was hoping this would be good, the trailer looked pretty cool and I liked the character   Good thing I waited for the moist metre, this and eventually critical drinkers video before deciding if I’d see it or not
Those are synonyms lol
Writer Guy: ...like a bat. Producer Guy: What kind of bats have you been looking at?  The kind with a six-pack. Obviously.
Man I think I bought a ticket to the wrong bat man movie.
Southland tales
Can't believe you haven't done the final destination franchise. Those are so dumb!
My jaw dropped when Morbius got the sixth Morb stone and turned half the population into bats
A bat six pack? like a..... BATpack???     I'll see myself out
Espero mencionen que a pesar de ser un antihéroe que chupa sangre, casi ni sale sangre
What an amazing and stunning movie, all its superb and mindblowing. I feel like you have to watch it several times to truly grasp the mind of the director behind it. I personally havent watch it but I get all this from this pitch meeting alone!
oh right, this thing came out. thanks for saving me a bunch of time
I havent seen the video but i really hope they talk about that really long Matt Smith dance scene
1:27 hes been looking at the batman
We can all agree that his content never disappoints us 💖💖💖
I’ve decided to avoid this movie since I don’t care but good thing I have the Pitch Meeting
I didn't watch the full video yet but WHY didn't you put the ending bit as the 200% rating on rotten tomatoes image, that should've been the punchline...
Bing chilling. 🍦
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: SPACEBALLS: The Pitch Meeting!
Ryan is a pure GENIUS!
Making fun of Morbius is super easy Bearley an inconvenience!
Noses are tight!
"Kinda feels like False Advertising,"  "Yeah, let's do some of that, that sounds great,"  "Well, okay then😁"  I have been binge-watching Pitch Meetings for a week now, and I am not even close to bored. This series is just absolutely amazing😂😂😂
Wow Wow wow... ... ... wow
True
Synthetic blood drinking is tight!
I haven’t even seen Morbius yet I’m still gonna see those whole thing despite the spoilers
This is my favorite YouTube channel and can you do a Gotham pitch meeting it’s a show on Netflix
Spoilers Ahead indeed! Everyone shouldn't be spoiled for the greatest movie of all time!
Watching Pitch Meetings instead of seeing bad movies is TIGHT!
Marvel traded Barry Keoghan for Jared Leto to DC for the role of Joker
I don't actually think Producer Guy has been more unhinged than in this pitch meeting
Pitch Meetings are how I watch the live action sony-verse movies now
Haven't seen the movie but I know I'll enjoy the Pitch Meeting
Money. Saved. Lol.
Yeah! Making the worst post credit scene in comic book movie history is tight!
I'm early
Batvin Klein
This will be my "viewing" of the movie. 😂
Been waiting for this so I dont have to see the actual movie
Soooo his a BATMAN!
Sounds super power orginiy 🤣
One minute and 73 comments
“Oh, man. It’s gonna be difficult to make a movie involving a Spider-Man villain without Spider-Man as good as an MCU Spider-Man movie.” “Actually, yes.” “Oh.”
So excited when I get this notification!
Yes!
Someone stole my Morbius tickets yesterday, then I realised they left 4 more.
God, it's so good not to have to wade through Screenrant uploads to get to the good stuff.
Morbius was the best April Fool's Day joke XD
I get filled in on the movie without having to watch the movie.  Thanks Pitch Meetings!
What a great birthday present! 🎂
I never even heard of Morbius before.
Thanks for saving me from actually watching it Ryan!
"We don't have to actually put it in the movie"   That is the motto this movie lived by
Do you have a pitch meeting for me.   Yes, yes you do.
GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE SO GLAD IT GOT 200% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES
The worst the movie the more exited I am for the pitch meeting, its crazy.
Spoilers ahead like I will ever watch it
Human Spider pin this comment please
gosh Morbius in the thumbmail is actually creepier than the actual one
Pitch meeting: Arcane or Peacemaker.
One of them movies i dont mind ryan spoiling for me lol
This has to be the worst comic book movie I have seen since the New Mutants.
Just give it up Sony. Ya struck oil once with Into The Spiderverse.
amazing 😅🤣
Literally the only thing good about this movie.
Ryan please join us in the comments section.  You'll overwhelmingly see things like "genius" "brilliant" "hilarious" "talented" "favorite" "best" "comedy gold" "love him" and "hottie".  None of the toxic comments are ever aimed at you, so it's a safe space.  ❤️
Freddy vs Jason pitch meeting
3:23 his vampire senses must have been tingling
This movie is a masterpiece, I don’t know what you’re talking about. The 8 minute sex scene was a bit much though.
Oh, watching a Pitch Meeting as soon as i see the notification is TIGHT!
"Is it gonna be hard to trick people to see this movie by lying that Michael Keaton is in a lot of it?" "Actually..."
