I love Floyd for Tank. he will take him far in life
we support our own too but they gotta be a great fighter
This guy is so genuine ❤️ that's probably the best reason I like him! To have a heart of gold and care for the well-being of others is a unmatched quality!!!
This is the moment Floyd got jealous!
Coach Cal the most legendary person out there in my opinion imagine how proud he is
MAYWEATHER NEEDS TO  GO BRO. THIS IS TANKS TIME. THE PEOPLE LOVE TANK! TANK CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF. WITHOUT MAYWEATHERS CLOWN SUIT. THAT TRAINER LOOKS LIKE MAN I JUST WISH MAYWEATHER WOULD SHUT UP AND LEAVE. IM A HUGE FAN OF BOXING AND THE FIGHTERS ALL COMING UP. PEOPLE LIKE MAYWEATHER AND EVEN DE LA HOYA AT TIMES THEY JUST IN THE WAY AND ARE SO JEALOUS OF THESE FIGHTERS, ALL HAVING MID LIFE CRISIS AND SHIT..LOL
Mayweather!! That was a beautiful speech,well said,let him enjoy his victory. Your right it's always who's the next fighter. THEY NEED TO JUST WAIT AND SEE !!🤔💜CONGRATS GERVONTA YOUR A BAD MAN 🥊
Damn, Mayweather on tank like he a mascot
They mentioned Devin Haney tank had a long training camp. 🤣😂🤣
Sportsmanship is very important. I’m learning so much from Davis and Floyd. I love these guys, if GOD will help me. I would love to meet these guys one day. There is something special about both these guys, Floyd sees himself in Davis and I certainly see myself in Floyd. To GOD be the glory always!!!
WE LOVE YOU TANK, FLOYD AND CALVIN YOU ARE 3 GREATS MEN ,GOD BLESS.
Keren,,👍
at the 11:20 mark to 13 mins saybit all Floyd Mayweather Is Teaching Gervonta Davis How To Duck His Way To The Top(“He gonna fight who he want to like I did)”
RYAN GARCÍA IS BETTER THAN TANK
En esos gorritos de basinica. MY abuelo se miava  de noche sentado en la cama lol jijiji :)
Why is floyd ducking these fighters!!! Today boxing is full of shit man let these guys fight in their prime not when they get to mid 30s bull sh$%
You gotta Love Floyd! He only wants the very Best for Tank!
Gervonta is all class
They way de grabed that mic 🎤 had he rolling
I could be wrong something tells me that tank kos Garcia
Stay humble god's grace and mercy🙏
Must be cool had mayweather as a mentor
Coach Calvin needs more recognition. He is very humble and dedicated to his fighter. No Calvin, no Tank
GERVONTA DAVIS won the fight but he got hit to much in that fight. In trouble when he reaches someone with hand speed and a little more power than cruz.
Tank is the real deal b4 that upper cut!
lmao when the media asks the next opponent suddenly its floyd answering, as i thought Tank aint duckin nobdy, its floyd Duckin them for gervonta
Gayweather
Stick with your coach floyd on some b.s.
All ways bet on BLACK✊🏾
Good job tank...stay sharp...God bless you brother
Tank need to work on his defense. He has the physical ability and skills to hit and not get hit
No one genuine looks for public praises! Calvin already knows that he play a significant part in Tanks success!!
I like how Floyd took the microphone when they mention Teofimo Lopez. Tank the Tanker is one of my favorite fighters, but he can’t beat Lomachenko, and he can’t beat Lopez. Simply a style difference that would be to his disadvantage. Floyd is letting us know that he is going to cherry pick and wait till fighters are not at their best for Davis to fight them. Next fight is going to be a guaranteed win to keep increasing the pay-per-view stock.
https://youtu.be/deU05BZfd0w
Gervonta .  Great attitude. Real champ.. real humble . Awesome sportsmanship.. keep it up Papa
Why Tank looked down and seems uncomfortable when Floyd says he's proud of him? Why not smile at least? What's going on there???
Floyd seems to be jealous always bringing himself up.
SHOUT OUT TO THESE BLACK FOLKS 🙏🏾
Floyd is dead on with wat he sayin
Man floyd got a gay asf fit on
Yo heard em... #TANKDAVIS
A few people know it but floyd has corona
Can he fight Ryan Garcia already? Garcia will get torn apart in the ring with Davis
Mayweather that's your boy and now the future of tank is in your hands
Tyson Fury also cheated and the gloves were signed of by commission that just proves that the boxing industry is corrupt and will fix a fight for money. I don't doubt that mayweather promotions payed commission for the glove switch on Davis, Santa Cruz team wasn't even notified, he could have switched into a similar glove and no one would have known about the glove switch!!!!
At first i thought floyd was kirk franklin coming to speak
I tell you now, TANK has matured being around FLOYD and mad respect to him shouting out Leo's POP'S that's a class act..Amazing fight and thank "GOD" SANTA CRUZ is recovered well.. Shout out to coach Calvin also..Mad respect..
i think switching from Grant gloves to Winning gloves confirms it that Leo sold the fight to Davis, Mayweather will pay for everyone just to continue his Legacy, ex.  2 million US dollar is not a bad way to loose a belt , Leo is also May's pal, and the only thing that you have to do is make it look good as realistic as possible without hurting him that good using high padding gloves for safety, listen man  somebody is making a fool in the sport so the cherry picking  and acting starts LOL, poor era, the boxing is beaten by the WWE ==]]
Y’all mfs need to stop tryna cause/create a rift where there isn’t one. Calvin and Floyd are both on the stage with Tank for a reason. Calvin and Floyd don’t have any beef. Both are doing their jobs. Floyd’s job is to use his persona to keep the dollars coming in and giving tank the keys from a fighters perspective. Calvin’s job is simple, keep doing what he always has. Tank can have two mentors. Floyd is just as big of a reason as Calvin, that Tank is able to be where he is at today. They all seem to know this and know each others roles in the process. Most of y’all that’s typin this craziness just don’t like Floyd. No story here.
Floyd is keeping his eye on gervonta. That’s good man, don’t want his potential wasted.
if AB had listened to Floyd like Tank, AB would have gone one of the greatest..
Okay davis you sound like 6 Nine XD
They fucking cheat they change gloves  on the las minute something they shouldn't do he use illegal gloves leo it was good on davis an till the punch next figh rematch if there is no rematch davis is scare like Floyd
If he would of lost mayweather would of made him fight him in the gym as punishment I heard he does that
Hes a humble dude. He came up from the hood u can tell by his slang
Tyson all over again 🙌🏾
The https://youtu.be/5pQvM9ZY41k future and what awaits us
Floyd rocking that little man costume LMAO
Alot of class n respect i love it.
I'm more miserable than you realize I say to all spies. If they knew what I know they would be doing what they're doing.
My boy Eli trending
Hi
https://youtu.be/C_dSARMi5Uw
Mayweather looking like a damn puppet
floyd that is how a fighter fights
Does anybody know if Floyd is wearin' a costume or is that jus' some corny ass $50,000 outfit made by some foreign fashion designer that I don't know about.?!
No part 2?... I was enjoying this Interview

Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning, it's about having faith that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation, all you have to do is have faith in Christ. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI (He also has a Spanish version.)
It’s SAD that  “TANK” sees MONEY First over the TRUE LOYALTY of his Ride or Die  Coach CALVIN.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping everyone from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
IF YOU START READING MAKE SURE YOU FINISH THIS IS A SIGN FROM GOD FOR YOU!!: GUYS IM BEING DEAD SERIOUS JESUS PUT IT ON MY HEART TO WRITE THIS AND SAID IT WOULD SPEAK TO SOMEONE REALLY!! Please don’t think I’m playing cuz I would never lie on His name like that 💯  God says He sees you & notices you for your true beauty. He said that there are times where you’ve struggled to find peace & happiness but those times you looked haven’t been ignored by Him. He said that He sees and notices all the hurt you’ve been through & all the times you stayed up overthinking. He says He has been there with you everyday even if it didn’t feel like you feel Him. He said that He loves you for who you are & understands you more than you sometimes understand yourself. He wants you to know nothing you do can make Him love you any less. He says that He’s seen your hurt and how people have said words that hurt you more than they know. He says He has compassion for what you went through and He wants you to know you’re never too far from Him. He said He will lift your spirit up & refresh you & will show you where you need to go in life. He said that He sees your family & cares for them so much & that they will be protected by Him wherever they go. He says He has seen your tears and the tears that you held in & you didn’t see it but He was there with you crying next to you. He feels hurt every time you felt hurt. He says He sees you as His precious beloved, He calls you His beloved. He sees you for who you really are, and it’s hard for others to understand but He understands you completely. He wants to give you His love into your heart & fill you with peace like you’ve never felt before. He wants to be your friend, He wants a relationship with you. He’s asking you to invite Him into your life. He’s at the door right now and wants to give you his blessings and unconditional love and peace. He’s asking if your willing to invite Him into your life?   IF YOU WANT TO ACCEPT HIM INTO YOUR LIFE JUST SAY THIS PRAYER OUT LOUD, NOT JUST IN YOUR HEAD, JUST SAY IT IT TAKES 1 MIN BUT MAKES YOUR SOUL 100% GO TO HEAVEN AND GIVES GOD ACCESS TO WORK IN YOUR LIFE, DONT HISITATE!!! MEAN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, & BELIEVE HE HEARD YOU BECAUSE HE DID!! ITS THAT EASY IM BEING SO SERIOUS SAY THESE WORDS AND MEAN IT & YOULL GO TO HEAVEN!!!   "Heavenly Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. I now renounce any connection, attachments, and leverage I have given willingly or unwillingly to the devil. I acknowledge him as an enemy and accused against me and also against you and I will not support anything he plans on doing in my life. I declare his assignments in my life broken and destroyed in Jesus name. I declare that I trust you are much much more stronger than him and I declare that I as a new believer have been given power and authority over and against him in Jesus name. You are my defense and my stronghold, my heart will trust in you. In Jesus name, I declare that my thoughts, actions, and behaviors are free from the devils doing and I know and have faith you are fighting for me. Anytime I feel weird or off or feel something trying to attack my spirit, I will realize that is not you but from the devil and I will say out loud ‘In Jesus name, I am free and on fire for God, anything near or around me will feel the scorching fire of the Holy God and the fire will not leave them in Jesus name’! (Literally say you are pouring fire on the demons around you whenever you feel off or just mad at the demons for being evil lol but you HAVE to say in Jesus name you are doing this) Lord thank you for hearing me and I trust and believe your ears are always listening to my prayer and even if I don’t see it with my eyes, my life is not changed in Jesus name. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen."  HES FOREVER IN YOUR LIFE AFTER YOU SAID THAT PRAYER NOW EVEN IF YOU DONT FEEL HIM JUST KNOW HE IS WATCHING OVER YOU! NOW ITS YOUR TURN TO GROW YOUR FRIENDSHIP W HIM! YOURE ALREADY ON YT SEARCH UP HOW TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!! THATS HOW YOU START HEARING HIM AND SEEING HIM AS A FRIEND!! DONT BE MAD AT GOD FOR NOT TALKING TO YOU IF YOU NEVER GET TO KNOW HIM AND TALK TO HIM. THATS HOW YOU BUILD A FRIENDSHIP!!!!11111hhhggghhjtgg  https://youtu.be/ljsbz6ngkSw  Hhfhf
I felt that Davis didn’t gave the trainer enough credit
Tank I need you to knockout Ryan garcia in first round. Your easy fight and big money is Ryan. He fuckin talk too much
12:34 I hate that phrase “ Top dog” (speak boy, good boy, sit boy, roll over boy) I don’t know I feel like athletics are puppets
Floyd needs all the shine and credit for everything in order to survive. Coach Calvin may not be upset about it. But Tank gave Floyd credit first when his coach that been with him is right next to him
Ryan García .VS. Davis
WBC super featherweight world champion Miguel “El Alacran” Berchelt (37-1, 33 KOs) wants all the big names. Whether it’s fellow Mexican action star Oscar Valdez, IBF champion Joseph “JoJo” Diaz, WBA champion Rene Alvarado, WBO champion and promotional stablemate Jamel Herring, or lightweight standouts Vasiliy Lomachenko and Gervonta Davis.
Congratulations 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
1 John 1:9 9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
Who will be the standout player on Seattle Surge?
Davis good match for teofimo lopez...
https://youtu.be/2ij3jXR7HyU
One of the cleanest upper cuts I’ve ever seen good shit
Cfcccffffffffcccccccccccccccccccc I ccc. V..
He looks like he should have stayed in school instead of boxing ..... he looks so educated
A person who likes this will become famous
Tank needs to stick with his trainer and keep floyd as a mentor promoter and he go very far he literally has a legend helping him
Floyd will literally turn any question into a question about him 🤣🤣 he really can’t help himself lmao
No one can deny the positive influence Floyd has had on Tank, keeping him focused on whats important.
Cherry pick of 2020
Lowblow of the year
Trump train 🚂
Floyd just looking out for Davis
This interview with Tank made me new a fan. He had graciousness to offer  Leo "good health" after that brutal knock out.  Hope he stays grounded..? Cause Floyd ain't NO ROLE MODEL FIGURE...🤦🏾‍♂️
Why are they asking Floyd questions. He didn't fight. He retire. I don't care for what he has to say.
That amigo didn't stand a chance
If Tank had any doubters, this performance should quiet them. Leo is legit as they come and this young man stopped him cold. Calvin Ford y'all, damn good trainer.
Great coverage 🥊🥊🥊
Why he remind me of 6ix 9ine
Tried to freeze the man lol
I love tank but them sideburns are terrible.
Good he got the training he needs and deserves to keep that stamina up !
Hey guys, please check out my YouTube channel about some of the stories that people of NYC have.
Bet he won't fight the real champ. Jake Paul.
Damn I already know it’s going to be a hood fight him and Ryan but Ryan’s dropping him if he plays his cards right
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My friends dragged me to an elephant boxing match the other day. I had a terrible time. It was impossible to tell the fighters apart; they both had gray trunks!
make him fight  Terrance (Bud) Crawford
The build up was fantastic, with Mayweather behind Davis and  if Davis can follow the rules and stay focused on  boxing  he'll be a great fighter,but if can't stay  focused he'll just be good,but Davis is a powerful puncher and he has speed.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️ Non-Duality
Floyd growing hair 🤣🐐
He has the same arrogant crappy attitude as floyd. Just wait Ryan will whip that behind.

This has nothing to do with this video. I HAVE to WARN in LOVE 💝💝.... Order out of chaos... Create the order from chaos. Living out Rev. In the Bible all... New world order or they call it the great reset is bible prophecy... Etc. Natural disasters will continue to increase. Crashing of the dollar to bring in one world currency, also pushing for one world religion, one world leader... This is all bible prophecy. If you wonder what happens next, read your Bibles... Repent and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, invite the Holy Spirit into your heart and turn from your sins... Believe in Jesus Christ and have faith.. The days ahead will continue to get worse.. Either choose Jesus Christ or mark of the beast or go live with Jesus in heaven!! Need to choose NOW!! I'm praying for the entire world daily to please choose Jesus before it is to late. 🙏🙏💝💝💐
Tank is doing everything Broner should have been doing !
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3
Floyd took the mask off like, "Man, about time you people ask me a damn question".
Always cool to see iconic legends support young new talent
https://youtu.be/4Qe8QvdEZN4
Mayweather vs the mic lol .
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOOEJgUKquB-SdaZZR3Nsb17H3Ifyj31p
I was going for Leo, I’m Mexican, and we tend to always support the Mexican boxer.  But Davis is a stand up guy, Davis landed that vicious uppercut.  Congrats to him and his team.  Davis won me as a fan being a respectful after the fight.  Legit was worry about Leo after he was still not moving and gave his pops a shoutout.  Mad Respect Davis! You won a Mexican fan.  You have a bright future young champ. agreed!
Mayweather 💯 👑 Davis 💯👑.. Thts how u keep the race strong.. Guidance.trust. understanding and love.
Next time put the belts on the floor or behind the fighters. jus say'n
FLOYD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH A REPORTER ASKING " WHO U WANNA FIGHT NEXT" THIS IS THE FIGHT GAME. THEY SUPPOSE TO ASK THAT DAWG.
Happy for G. Dominate this shit 💪🏾
How can you not like this guy ? He’s a humble monster !
How can *YOU* be saved and have *ETERNAL LIFE?*  1) *YOU* have *SINNED* (Romans 3:23) 2) The wages of *YOUR* sin is separation from God and death, in the *ETERNAL FLAMES OF HELL* (Romans 6:23) 3) To avoid this fate and go to heaven, *YOU* must be *PERFECT* because God is *PERFECT* (Revelation 21:27) 4) *YOU* will never be perfect because *YOU* have sinned, so *YOU* need a *SAVIOUR* since *YOU* cannot earn heaven by *YOUR* works (Ephesians 2:8-9) 5) Jesus Christ *IS* God; who came in the flesh, lived a *PERFECT* life and died as a *SUBSTITUTE* for *YOU,* so *YOU* don't have to pay the penalty for *YOUR* sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). 6) All God demands is that *YOU BELIEVE* in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; that *HIS BLOOD* washes away *ALL* of *YOUR* sins and makes *YOU PERFECT* (John 3:16, John 6:47, Romans 10:9-10, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4) 7) Now *YOU* cannot go to hell because *YOU* have *NO* sins to pay for. Jesus *PAID* for *ALL* of *YOUR* sins. *YOU* have received the *FREE GIFT* of *ETERNAL LIFE* (1 John 5:13)
Two guys that abuse women.  Awesome.
Random people who like this will become millionaire someday.
I KNOW WHAT FLOYD WHISPER TO DAVIS WHEN HE GO TO THE RING SIDE. HE SAID KEEP RUNNING SO THAT YOU WILL NOT BE HIT. BUT DAVIS DIDNT FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTION. SO THE OUT COME, BOOM HE KNOCK OUT HIS OPPONENT. CONGRATS DAVIS. TRY TO BE HUMBLE ALWAYS. GIVE PRAISE TO GOD BEFORE YOU FIGHT.
Stop thanking Floyd and thank your damn coach man!! Im 8 minutes in and he keeps praising Floyd and not his coach not 1 time!!
COMMON FLOYD DAVIS IS FAR BETTER AND MORE EXCITING FIGHTER THAN YOU COZ HE DONT KNOW HOW TO RUN IN THE RING NOT LIKE YOU KEEP RUNNING UNTIL THE END OF YOUR FIGHT. HAHAHA
Floyd has zero style. Look like he going to third grade dance
Davis is a great champion so is Cruz respect for both fighters
his voice is starting to sound like floyd's
Tank is fucking biggest Superstar... He is everywhere I go... YouTube, Facebook,tweeter, Instagram..... And his videos has a lot of views
Nah when u watch it in slow motion it’s crazyy https://shrinke.me/l3QrI3Dl
They should recover with https://ultifitperformance.com
Mayweather sitting up there coughing. For a athlete of his statue, that is a concern to me. Congratulations to Davis for a stunning victory.
Floyd looks like mormon in those hats....don't suit
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💘💘💘💘💘💘💘👍👍👍👍👍😍😍😍😍😍
Floyd always fuckin something up lol the mask and the  glasses then the mic  lol
Gervontas beard looks like two long side burns conected to his cheeks 😀😝
Why is Floyd dressed like the ref from Mike Tyson's Punch Out? 😂
The tank was in damn shape for sure. That's all he has to do.
so i contacted this company called onixlogtech@gmail.com via email for a bitcoin  hack, then they set up my bitcoin wallet with a programming software, my balance was initially 0.2 btc and it turned to 18.2btc in just 43 minutes. i withdrew the btc out immediately lol but they are like the best so far now (onixlogtech@gmail.com )
Listening to Tank talk about his adjustments shows his boxing IQ is up there. Its not just power.
López 🆚 Davis come on
I want to hear his trainer no more Floyd

Calvin is the Black Cus D'mato with a mini Tyson. Lives, breathes eats and sleeps Tank Davis. They must NEVER part whilst Tank fights.
Born to fight he is for real
Floyd looks like he's got bean pies and oils for sale
Interviewer : tank what’s your thoughts on the fight  Floyd: look the thing is this ,he’s one hell of a fighter & all my cars are paid for
mayweather was annoying the entire fight ... let that man have his spotlight like they did when it was yours
Mayweather looking like he ready to sell bean pies lol
In observation there is only pure perception not the interpretation of that perception by thought. If you can find the root of fear then unconscious and conscious fears can be understood.
Let's put some respect on AB's name too, a brother to lots of amazing young fighers.  AB was the first one to believe in him.  And presented him to Floyd on a platter..
What happened to Ramen in 2020? https://youtu.be/LwfHYfemzGE find out

I wish all the coaches and Mayweather would stepped back behind the scenes and allow him to enjoy his moment. I understand support but balance is very encouraging to any person. His family at minimum should be up there

Floyd hugged Gervonta after the fight and either whispered "Can you teach me to KO someone?" or "Can you teach me to read?"

You thought him very well he's a real knockout😉
let's be real Leo Santa cruz  it's coming he started 119 pound he's a champion and 4 divisions  Santa Cruz is A featherweight ok  he's a small guy ok !!  Davis is Lightweight natural ok ! Cherry picker congratulation Davis 🤷‍♂️😆😬 !! Hey Santa Cruz he wanted to take this risk in 135 in this division !! Ok let's be real and this division Davis  is a bigger guy !!ok 🤷‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ let's be real
Does anyone know why Davis changed the gloves from the warm up in the locker room to fight time? Seems a bit shady to me
Congrats 👏👏. Take speech classes too bro, illuminate yourself and others.
Www
Floyd  allow the young man to breath .must you always talk about yourself .
No disrespect to Floyd one of the Best but Tank Davis has natural talent and training team has been with him for year's give Calvin Ford his credit
I was going for Leo, I’m Mexican, and we tend to always support the Mexican boxer.  But Davis is a stand up guy, Davis landed that vicious uppercut.  Congrats to him and his team.  Davis won me as a fan being a respectful after the fight.  Legit was worry about Leo after he was still not moving and gave his pops a shoutout.  Mad Respect Davis! You won a Mexican fan.  You have a bright future young champ.
Mini Mike Tyson
If tank turn his back on his coach it will be the downfall of his career
I find it sad that Santa Cruz got knocked out in front of his dad 😔
The TANK is just a MANOS DE PIEDRA GUY, tank is a real boxer and fighter guy
Floyd Mayweather Jr's a promoter!.
"It started ready"😆😅🤣

This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment ; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
Respect Champ✊ first thing he said “Im glad he’s okay”
Save the Tongass National Forest
He gave more props to mayweather than his coach
Mayweather be quick to change the subject 😂 I think lopez will beat Davis
Why is he with a black young fighter and not a white fighter or Mexican fighter.. Racial division is still a thing people don't let these idiots take your money on this stupidity
He might love him a lil more than yaya😂
Yall need 2 check out Anthony cuba 🇨🇺  hes about 2 reperesent for the latino community .
Wtf mayweather stay ur ass out of his spot light
#5...
Floyd looks super gay with that hat and outfit on!
Floyd you love the money tank produces thats the unconditional love u have
Being Mexican I wanted to like Canelo so bad but I never could with this cat it just comes natural definitely will be buying all his fights won over a fan.
Industrial !off the 1950's machine! Anodized Aluminium Car Hop Trays are available on Amazon, to the public for the first time EVER!!! Made in USA!
Can we have a match between the tank and the monster of Japan (for some reason I can't Spell his name)
N
Congrats tank
Not taking no credit from tank he’s a beast but this fight was way to predictable. Bryan is a pretty boy all talk will see what happens with kambell * not sure I pronounced his right. But I tank vs haney would of been more unpredictable??¿¿
Ryan Garica is next!!!
Why Floyd dressed like andre3000 tho???
Stfu // calling anybody out is boxing” you just going to pick all the easy targets just like you did
You all miss how classy Tank is. He said he’s glad Leo was ok and on his tweet that his dad was also ok. Respect to this man
You guys should be watching this  Breaking law!!! Pandemic Training outdoor
Tank is a class act! He’s a great champion! Humble Guy!
Bmore Bmore baby ddh💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🤘🤘🤘🤘✊✊✊
Y’all mason are hilarious. Good ol red and black
Floyd gonna try and get Coach Calvin out of the picture.  Coach has a stable of young boxer although. Lorenzo "Truck" Simpson next
Tank became the "Boxing" son that Floyd never had. I'm glad these two are on the same team and taking this ride together 👍
https://youtu.be/AOOhq-q1VdU🗣
Ryan garcia is a deadman
I like his relationship with the coach and Floyd. The love is mutual
Congratulations Tank! Genuinely happy for you. A few words of wisdom for you. Never forget what got you to the dance. As a boxer you will only go as far as your original team(Coach Calvin and Kenny) take you. Real skills WIN fights. You've been breed by the best and brightest minds in boxing. Keep your original family close. Enjoy the success that comes with being under the Mayweather banner but never forget what REAL LOVE looks like and don't mistake that for BUSINESS LOVE. Business will always love when you making them money. Real love was in gym with you when you didn't have a penny. Much Respect for Coach Calvin and Coach Kenny! You created a monster!!!
Tank vs Mayweather
Great chicken recipe video! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f8OyMREDkeg
watch this for relax your mind against the covid 19 https://youtu.be/XqXgrdO6q3Y
This fool got lucky! Davis started hot, but as soon as he noticed that Cruz was stronger then he had anticipated, he started to backup...lol.  If Davis hadn't knocked Cruz out, he would of lost this one.   You go Lucky Davis!
Did see another interview with Leo Santa Cruz and was glad he was good.
Tank is a nice guy i like him
Tank has a great uppercut punch and great fight.  They are going to build Tank slowly.  He will not put his record or tittle at risk knowing Mayweather as he said "I'm putting him on the same position I put myself.  Mayweather will pick his fight to keep bringing in that 💵💵💵  Mayweather: As long as he wins and make me 💵💵💵 I will love him.  Jk
Gervonta "and thangs like that" Davis 🤣
tank is a beast happy for his victory, gonna be mayweather 2.0. has tyson power also kinda talks like him too lol
Damn Floyd. Just answer the damn question.
Calvin ford is a trustworthy kind hearted man, something difficult to find these days, win or lose. I often hear him stress to gervonta, “he asked you what YOU think. YOU” - it shows the type of relationship they have it’s how someone in ur immediate family would talk to you...I’m happy that he was able to right his wrongs in life come out of prison dedicate himself to martial art and developing young men and keeping them off the streets and twenty years later he gets his first WC....god bless gtd stay safe out the way and always focused
why they did his edge up like that dam
Ok boomer
Will somebody...anybody...in the Davis-crew and even Tank himself say: "Yo, Floyd...uhhhhh, you had your career, your time, and while your guidance is appreciated...please, STOP projecting yourself into Tank's career, press conferences' etc.  Floyd is conflicted; yes, he wants Tank to do well, yet Floyd love the limelight at Tank's expense; note how Floyd is soooo petty about exposure how how adjusts the mics etc; Just watch!
Respect Tank so much! "Hardwork Dedication!! - Floyd Mayweather" Best quote a boxer can have.. First thing Tank said, he's glad Leo's good... ✊🏾 How can you not love that
Floyd's dressed like he's about to sing Down By The Bay with his barbershop quartet...
This can be a big big money fight with a full crowed once everything goes back  to normal dought bob arum will let that happend do
I like tank....stay humble lil bro
yawn
https://youtu.be/_-_UF7zEoq0
If something happened to (Tank Davis) please remember him drinking that bottled water that will refer to him from someone in the audience. (please remember)ijs
Floyd one of the greatest boxers ever. But I don’t like seeing he’s ass. He already had he’s shine.
Gervonta Tank Davis Is Strong and Heavy Puncher But He Allow to Develop Her Speed and Defense tactic For He Able to Use it and Next Fight Like in Teofimo lopez Devin Haney Ryan Garcia Because if he not Allow to Develop Her Speed and Punching power He Able To Deafeat He In This 3 Notable Elite Fighter in Lightweight its because Teofimo lopez is Harder and Having Speed Technic Puncher and Devin Haney is Having Strong And Speed Punch and Ryan Garcia Gervonta tank Davis need Some more Exercises and Training To Improve her Defense Tactic in Boxing Career
@4:35 Tank sayd Maywhere promotions...boxer talk
I am so glad you're humble and you're sticking with your team that you started with God bless you Class Act
The question posed to Tank was did he show much of himself with Cruz that fight? He could have killed the guy.taosted ravioli,hot! Quacamole,c'mon!
I love that u are so great
Digging Floyd's drip.
I want to see Tank fight Pacquiao😂😂😂
I want to see Tank fight Pacquiao😂😂😂
I want to see Tank fight Pacquiao😂😂😂
Good to see Floyd showing him the ropes the correct way. Floyd. do you still have that picture Cito made of you and the family?
“ I hit him and he went all the way back , I was like damn “  damnnnnn !!
Somebody dig me out!
About round 4 when tank ate everything leo had to give and kept comin with those left hands, u could see the look in Leo’s eyes that he knew he had to go out swinging
This guys theyfight the very best not like canelo avoiding  all these guys
lmaoo floyd is a funny ass clown lol peep this guy and how he took the mask and glasses off lmfaoo @4:44
Floyd will rob him in the end watch
If this kid Davis wants some respect from the Boxing World he needs to stop messing around with Bums, get in the ring with a Ryan Garcia.,.,
Hope he no learn from Floyd running around the ring. Great fight.
He has to give Floyd the credit Its only right if tank would have trained in B more Leo would have made the fight more competitive due to Tank being too laxed because of familiar surroundings. He finally saw what Floyd been telling him about what it takes to be the best you have to move up and gravitate toward more cultivating surroundings to achieve greatness. Coach Calvin know he's not left out, he understands business and he know he Will eat what Tank eats he know Tank a real one never will turn on him no matter the success.
From fort pierce https://youtu.be/jCHlJNzxExM
PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.
Question 4 Floyd I'm just adjusting myself look at him😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Beautiful! Talking about reviewing this for my youtube channel 🩸 🔥
Quality operator, but he comes across as such an asshole 😂😂
Mexican here wished for Leo's to win he was making a great fight, Gervonta is really smart as well made some changes and got that great knock out,  after fight interviews a find Davis is a great human congratulation to the champ

HOPE ❤️ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 ❤️📖🙂 nkjv ❤️🥊
I'm going to start calling tank the sandman because, he's putting them to sleep!!!!!! ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
He is not the best are you kidding me, he needs to fight top dogs.
Wondering if Floyd would have been there if he lost...
So proud of Floyd giving back and staying relevant
give the fans what they want... you ruin boxing making fights in every division that is ok watchable but not what they want. At least stop saying that. match fighters in their prime play with each other. ufc is becoming bigger because of that giving fans what they want but no for boxing. boxing is like production of tv and technology , we have already make the perfect products but we dont sell it right away because at the midtime we can sell and earn more money by giving prior models to the public.
FACT IS TANK GOT THE BLUE PRINT TO DETHRONE FLOYD IF HE WANTED TO "FAN BOI" FLOYD TRYNA TAKE CREDIT WHEN NOT LONG AGO HE WAS WORKING WITH THE OPS "HANEY"
Did Anybody See When They Ask Tank About Ryan Garcia, Teofimo, Devin Haney “How he fumbled the Mic For About 15 secs
Mayweather got mad cuz they mentioned Garcia lol earlier he was talkin bout who has Ryan beat
Tank you know you with the best why you the best bro so stick don't move
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .............................................................................................................................
Yo wdf is this‼️‼️ https://youtu.be/XqG4JGdnktE
Floyd "the mike snatcher" Mayweather
Let's go Champ!
Damn Mayweather Look like might be able to read
I want to see you do dat again den I rate you
💯💥
Tank should really think about going SOLO fr.He doesnt need Floyd his name is already out there.Its like Floyd trying to steal his spotlight all the time like bro come on you had your time
👍
People can talk about floyd talking.  But I see Mayweather promotions on that black and white board in the background.  🤔🤔🤔🤔
“Floyd, here’s a question about Tank and the projection of his career.” “Yes. Let me talk about myself”
super😈
All that money and mayweather still dresses like an idiot🤣
A lot of you seem to for get that he fought a smaller fighter , Davis is strong but who can he fight next ? He needs to move up if he belives in his knock out power . Amazing fight by the way
There’s never a time Floyd doesn’t talk about himself lol
6 more rds of that Beating in Tank was gonna leave tha Ring looking like AB 🤣
Coach Calvin might of felt a little way about him mentioning Floyd’s name first but he’s not tripping him and gervonta came along way
Lucky punch he would beat tank if it wasn't  for that punch
Mike Tyson and don king all over again
Nice interview lil brotha
Luke 12:25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
4:32 i thought hed say his big shoutout would be for Coach Calvin. Damn that must’ve hurt him🧢
Leo was doing good. He needs more physical training. Get more muscle,more mass.  Davis was stronger for sure.  You can easily see it second fight Santa Cruz will cause some damage.
yo lo kiero ver con loma o con teofino
💪
Impressive win
7:38 big smoke
If Tank move camp to Vegas who,s gonna run Upton Boxing in Bmore.
Tank would get Ryan out of there in 2/3 rounds
Tank is a world class boxer with an A-1 team. He's gonna go much further than he already has.
Great job tank, as long as he stays wit money may he gon be alright, tank fought leo like he did cuz he knew leo couldnt hurt him but when and if he fights devin gary or lopez the style gon switch n he gon be ready, from where i sit Gtd gon be the champ for along time to come, his power at that weight is something crazy.
Good K.O. Tank, Give Leo his credit because this was Tanks toughest fight, Had Tank been out of shape or off in any kind of way he would have Lost Tonight, But Tank Davis is the real Humble Deal
Advice for Gervonta Davis love you my dude no Homo when you go out doing interviews have your crew bring your own water don’t drink water that people left for you on the table love you My dude Brooklyn!!!
No matter what they say about you stay humble and knock your opponents out like pinballs.
Just stay humble and don't get cocky with time like Floyd.
coach in better shape than most men at any age haahahaha im about to get in that shape again, im 40 and i teeter around that build
Go get my phone go get my shirt uhh PLEASE  or don’t these people know what manners are guess not
I never liked this fight from the get go because leo was coming up from one two weight division but i won't lie like everyone else i was a bit surprised to see leo bulked up i actually thought he had a shot after round 5 leo should've just try to box him and move
I wanna see that Mexican outfit and hat that GTD wore to the ring as a sing of respect to Leo & his ppl, but I'll like some body from the press to ask Tank about it, why & how he came up with the idea of wearing his opponent's colors to the ring,  it did reminds me of the late Rodger Mayweather ( may he RIP) when he used to come to the ring with that same outfit back in the day, Floyd also did it for the Oscar fight, I don't mean no disrespect, I'm just curious...
Damn Floyd stop reflecting on yourself it’s Tanks time play the back and help guide but it’s not about you in the ring and your career anymore... we know your story champ damn! Let Tank and his Trainer enjoy the moment!
Damn he dont be giving no credit or shine to Calvin his trainer. Floyd need to be behind the scenes, he want that shine
Davis vs ryan or lopez 。ahmmm
I'm now realizing that Floyd and Tank had similar struggles as kids. I can see why Floyd has a greater interest in Tank.
Floyd don king
Great fight tank does not need Mayweather would be a star with any other promoter after watching this fight.
So nobody notice Floyd taking “the champ’s” mic and making him share with the coach’s mic?   😒
TANK NATION BALTIMORE IT ISSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
Y’all bugging when he says his team he’s referring to his coach Floyd isn’t apart of his team so he mention him by name!! He paid his coach the upmost respect
Perfect, i predicted it a TKO. Congrats Tank🥊
Looks like Gervonta did a lot of growing up. I hope he keeps Floyd and his current team, and stays away from distractions. Great performance.
Wowwww, CONGRATULATIONS MR. DAVIS!!! YOU SOUND SHARP TANK!!! KEEP GOING CHAMP!!! YOU’RE BLESSED BY THE BEST!!!   MAYWEATHER IS ONE SMART GENIUS!!! BLESSINGS TO YOU ALL AND BLESSINGS TO US!!!   THANKS ESNEWS   REEEEPORTING!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 tank
You know what, Congrats to Tank. But here is my thought, I read comments and all the time I see  Mexican and Black hating on each other. No don't do that, we should be proud of each other, Why b cuz    Black and Mexican Boxers,   are always the best fighters. With out us Boxing wouldn't be shit. Shout out to Leo's dad!
Tank is what he is💪💪
hes a proper good fighter.the best in his field
Facts
GERVONTA DAVIS VS LEO SANTA CRUZ MIS-MATCH NEARLY ENDS IN TRAGEDY FOR SANTA CRUZ! Gevonta Davis ended the fight against Leo Santa Cruz in dramatic fashion, the mis-match nearly ended in tragedy for Leo Santa Cruz!  https://youtu.be/4Q4vUl6f_R0
Coach Calvin beautiful guy congrats Tank u bulldozer nice outfit 👌
Definitely deserve a looking https://youtu.be/k0E6ttIRiFM
He actually does very decent interviews he aint lied yet ❤️ this Guy Congrats on the win 🥊👑
Best punch I've seen in a long time👊
Floyd, go read a book. Let tank have his moment bruh!💯
Did any of them visit a barbershop? Look like they on their AJ shit🤣🤣🤣. Good ko Tank congrats bruh
At the 12 min mark. Floyd want him to cherry pick just like him 😆. Boxing needs end-of-the-year tournament everybody got to fight everybody, in there weight class.  if you scared get the f*** out the sport
Gravanta davis, only fights boxer he knows he can beat. Bullshit artist.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🤝🤝👍🏼
Do the Damn thing Tank !!!!
This the most full on respect that tank has outwardly has given the opponent without being nudged to it... ya KNOW leo is a real1. Always has been.  Not saying tank disrespectful usually, I'm saying it's a testament to Leo. Tank been giving him shine since the jump. I like that alot.  I've been following Leo for years. It hurt me to see him stretched out. I knew it was probable that he would take hurtful shots.  But stretched out... that was harder to see than usual
Floyd low key always brings up his career lol
Shout out to Tank...I fu**s wit money 💰 may...but I think he'll go to the next level if he play the background little more...let his fighters shine...he had his shine already and will shine even brighter as a promoter...TMT 💯
Lil lame to hear when tank said "ya know when your body is saying no but your mind says yes" etc and floyd says "they dont know bout that" . I know the world puts a hard time on floyd, but man he has no idea how much I've pushed thru when I was way down... ring or not.
I stop hating floyed man dat dude is funny.
Congratulations!!!!
I knew tank would WIN . I tend to always want the black man to win . They are just another beast
Mayweathers only loss was to the mic stand 😂
FOR LESS THAN THAT PEOPLE ARE IN JAIL.  THIS IS A CRIMINAL TENDENCY AND NEED TO BE PUSNISHED.  HOW CAN PEOPLE CAN CALL THIS A SPORT, THIS IS ONLY A WAY TO KEEP THE CRIMINALS AWAY OF THE STREETS AND MAKING MILLONS FOR IT.  ARE WE CRAISE? WE PAY TO OVERCAME OUR OWN FEARS?  JUST LOOK MAYWETHER HE IS AN ILITERATERATE BUT MADE MILLONS WITH PEOPLE'S FEAR.  LET HIM ENJOY WITH HIS FAMILY AND AFTER 30 DAYS WE LOOK FOR THE NEW VICTIM (WORDS OF MAYWETHER) HOW CAN ANYONE ENJOY WIT HIS FAMILY AFTER THIS CRIMINAL ACT.  ONLY SUB HUMANS CAN ENJOY IT.
Santa Cruz is 🗑. Tank did what he was supposed to do. Let's get a top 130 pounder next.
That momen the reporter mentioned Teofimo and Floy start to play with the Mic!... lol!
One of the most vicious uppercuts in all of history. Great job champ! Enjoy.
Gervonta Davis vs. Ryan Garcia!
Floyd has so much experience as a fighter and from his uncle and his father - he the goat fr
What is that belt on the right?
Good job Tank!!!!🥊
U see thru Floyd #hater tank get away from Floyd fast as u can
Seems like Floyd was waiting to find a young man like Tank to help him get to the top.
Might be fight of the year
Tank and money sucks
No disrespect to the champ, but the young brotha needs speech classes. Floyd- Get the man a college English tutor for media days, commercial$, etc.- & hopefully it's not part CTE already cuz he's slurring a lot of his words. Not nearly as marketable as say a SRL if he can't speak well (Unless your name's Mike Tyson)
Shit davis face swole, shit leo was giving it to him. Tank needs more fights, still not ready for lopez, or Loma. Think if they hit him like that?? But great win tank. Still has work to do though.
Having some trouble with that microphone there buddy? Lol Floyd was sitting there trying to fix it for half the interview
That was crazy good win, wit that punching power he will be threat to everyone till he is 40
I want to see Davis fight some real competition
Man its good to see floyd in the side chilling 😎
Floyd  happy cuz he made millions off betting on this fight lol 😂
No excuses now he has to fight the best no more cherry-picking
Tank a dog though but he gone eventually part ways with floyd and i hope he do so he can fight on his own terms just like floyd did
I thought davis didnt like mayweather due to him preferring and training  haney? What happened
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
As he get bigger he gone start realizing that he need to make his own desicions and not let floyd babysit him
anybody else see the maturity in davis...! Good to see man.!
No one can deny the positive influence Floyd has had on Tank, keeping him focused on whats important.
I’m just wonder why no body said none bout Floyd growin his hair back
Let's go, Baltimore stand up!
I knew this was going to happen. I saw tank make a few adjustments in the ring. That was an outstanding performance. He looked like an experienced pro and not a sloppy wild puncher like i've seen some do. People bash tank for his weight issues but personally I don't give a dam as a long as I get to see a fight. I also don't care what color fighter you are, if I see talent, im a fan. Leo went to 💤. I can't wait to see tank against Ryan or Teo, or tank and Haney. This weight division stacked.
He sound like a humble mike Tyson tbh
who you wanna fight! who you wanna fight! hahahaha your not a true fighter! a fighter want next!
Real solid stand up boxer. Most boxers don’t have integrity coming from dark atmospheres, however with Coach Calvin keeping him grounded he’s destined for greatness ✊🏾💯 #SolidGuy
Your just like a young gamboa Flyod wand to hide you but at the end you cant win an elite  fighter! Lopez will slow your cArrer! and the end your carrer will  be misserable!
Hell is wrong with floyd im a big fan of his but it seem like he want to take Calvin out the picture.. why he taking the mic from Calvin etc smh .
Thats right Money May!! Grab that mic & talk that shit!!💯❤
It took Floyd the narcissist less than 10 seconds to start talking about himself.
GOOD FUCKIN PUNCH BIG HOMIE..💯💯
🗣🗣NOW FIGHT MR GARY RUSSELL JR!!!
Man Coach Cal probably won’t say it out of respect for him and his real father. But dats his son in his heart. Fight me
mayweathers bitch ! let Tank do his own thing and see where he ends up bit of trouble with the weight really not good for fighters train harder .still nice win time will tell ..lot repect for leo
Floyd chris eubank mayweather
I would looooooove to see him fight Ryan Garcia 🥊
Man sounds like 69 on his voice
Floyd Loves this guy!!!!
Coach and team!! Coach is the main ingredient.
Bro you got lucky that’s was a lucky punch
This Knockout was a master piece. Respect to Leo, he gave Tank such a hard paycheck...
Floyd like willy wonka just took a dip in the chocolate river and came to bless this Tank kid with a golden belt
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH ..
teofimo lopez soon after the fight he mentioned names
I think Mr Davis should make Ryan Garcia wait Lopez wait and Devin Haney wait to fight him as long as possible make em earn it cuz nobody gonna beat Davis he learn more and be more experienced if he makes them wait they have to stay relavent and undefeated they all three have a size advantage over Mr Davis he is great tho it's perfect I think he should gain more experience then take these fighters out that are bigger later when the macthup is more even Mr Davis is the future if he can stay humble and not rush into the other big fights
Is Money May supposed to be wearing a Halloween costume in this
Ryan Garcia's next
He beats Lopez x sure...!
Let floyd talk for u when they talk bout actual opponents..lol
Ryna Garcia is ready for u
Congrats to him. Great young puncher. First time see him fight. Already a fan of him.
davis is what fans are looking for. unlike floyd, whom is more of a runner and dont want exhanging punches. boxing is a form of entertaining sport and so fighter should be exciting too no running no hugging it should be pure boxing.
0:47 I quit my work because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
congratulations tank
Picture perfect KO
This man got my respect... I believe on him and his natural talent.
Tank sounds extremely mature. This is bad news for everybody @ 130
That was a legendary fight Hagler Hearns all over again my hat off to that young man great Fighting Man
Floyd is very arrogant and disrespectful towards coach Calvin. Smh
Wtf is Mayweather wearing lmao
That's what he learned from Mike Tyson hanging out with him
I didn't like tank at first but hes really showing a superstar mindset, being a true sportsman. dude can straight fight no question anymore
Round 5 Santa Cruz production just about stopped behind a body shot...💪🏾 congrats champ...👑
Mayweather made me laugh when he said Davis belongs in top 10 p4p now 😂. As if fighters on that list are there by design
Nice Tank, great win and very respectful. Big ups bro
Floyd don't Love him!! He loves the 💰💰💰 his making off him. Tank reminds me of MIKE TYSON!! GREAT FIGHTER BUT BUT VERY UNEDUCATED AND CAN BE EASLEY TAKING ADVANTAGE OFF.
What's wrong with Floyd
They were slick about getting him to speak even though he wanted to wait for Floyd. LoL
Tank is not just a beast. Seems like a good guy too.
Might be knockout of the year,changed Cruz real fast 💯
One  hellava accomplishment
Floyd is a NARCISSE
I hate how floyd always has to talk about himself!!!!! STFU DONT KNOW BODY WANNA HERE ABOUT YOU! LET TANK SHINE! WHAT A NARCISSISTIC PERSON
Baby Tyson does it again 💯
13:40
The narcasis of floyd never seems disappoint me.all the interviews from his fighter seem to always talk about himself
Please tell me I’m not the only that noticed Floyd has hair wtf is going on 5:48 pause that sht 🤣
Mayweather looking like RUN DMC!!!
Devin will beat tank ass
Coach Calvin is not being disregarded. Y’all got realize that no fighter has one trainer. It’s a team effort.
I see Mayweather taught him some skills
He just got caught bc his hands was down. Thats boxing. I still think deeper waters tank would have been in trouble.
Good job champ .. 🙏🏼
I woke up with a headache after watching that vicious ko has to rank high in a memorable chalacking thought his head was gonna end up in the third row glad he's ok
floyd growing hair lol
You good Davis, just don't turn out to be like that foo Broner... ¨mucha suerte¨ from old Mexico.
Gervonta you don't need to grow up the only a man would say  what you just said, about you and your family and the opponent you're a hell of a man and a hell of a boxer and I'll watch you through your whole career much love..1-LOVE-TMT
Shout out to Ellie
Floyd got hair
The floyd show lol i love floyd though but he shouldnt be up there let him enjoy it
Tank is going to eventually get tired of Floyd calling him a kid😬
TEO vs Tank !!!! Mayweather don’t want that smoke!!!
Reporter: tank when are you ready to unify against Garcia, lopez, haney, Loma   Mayweather: ummm he is going to rest and wait .... for the next cheery pick
Watch floyd make Tank vs berchelt next.
Took his mask off quick lmao
U can tell the Coach Calvin dont really like the fact that Floyd trying to come in and play the coaching role after everything that they been through to get to this point , Never turn your back on the ones that struggled with you and risen with u from your Lowest points and helped you build every part of who u are, coach Calvin is a Father to him fr rather he realizes it or not, may not be thru blood but as far as action he was there.
Look at what a 126 pounder did to Tank's face.  No wonder he never fights top guys in his own weight class . LOLL
Tank knocked his block off...  I thought he was dead...WOW
Respect to tank good guy and a good fighter
Lol their talking like this was a 50-50 fight and Tank overcame a huge hurdle. Santa Cruz was two weight divisions smaller, you can't get any credit for this win. Sorry
Mannnn it look like tank is going to leave coach Calvin in the wind! He big up floyd every step of the way!!
Calvin is the real star congrats to both of y'all!!
Boys gotta learn that philly shell to avoid the uppercut. It literally is 75%+ effective against the uppercut
Haney must be something serious because was quick to grab that mic when they brought up his name.
Floyd looking at those belts like if he was 10-15 years younger he would take them all
I hope Floyd will fall back just a little to let Tank get his shine alone...no young competitor want to be in anyone's shadow and I can see a Rocky 5 scenario in the future...I HOPE NOT FOR BOTH THEIR SAKES....I feel like Tank is good for Mayweathers team and Floyd's experience is definitely good for Tank
Floyd smiles internally every time Tank mentions his name and promotion company
Floyd been sucking too much Ddddd...dedication!
Tank wayyyyy more humble than mayweather and AB i hope he stays that way. If u can get the mayweather fame combined with the love of all the people you will be the real TBE
Congrats on the win for Davis. Leo made the mistake his father told him not to do and that was exchange punches with Davis and not staying on the ropes. He should've continued trying to outboxing and moving around to try to take Davis into deep waters in the later rounds..
Floyd is looking like a Cornelius with that fit
The championship
When coach Calvin was talkin ...I didn't like how floyd started talking to tank ....Calvin was saying good stuff and I fell tank feels he has to fight to please both
Teo is best ATM 🏆
I think Davis is becoming great but Floyd have to step aside in this situation. Respect your trainer and training staff. Trainer was looking like a proud father when Davis describes the fight.  Sucks that his name wasn't mention. Shout out to coach Calvin.
Been telling people tank is the real deal
Floyd up there looking like the hood " colonel sanders " .  Floyd be like " like I said before " even if he never met you before
When Santa Cruz got up he looked like  "which one of yall kicked me"
Great night, I’m glad I bought this fight. Craziest knockout of the year. Good job guys.
MAN I LOVE TANK DAVIS HES SO HUMBLE BRO THATS AMAZING I HOPE HE CAN ENJOY HIS VICTORY WITH OUT ANY PRESSURE OF WHO HE FIGHTING NEXT
I wonder how the relationship Floyd vs tank coach Will be like
Congratulations tank amazing performance and to Floyd keep up the great work Mayweather promotions is on the rise action pact fight..🥊🥊🥊
Tighten up that defense and tank will go FAR
Much respect for Tank. He is showing much respect and his interviews are getting much better. Congrats Tank on the win.
I wanna see how David does with an amazing boxer with the same knockout power he has like Crawford.
Tank is special no doubt about it, I Had no idea 💡 he was as good as that.✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
Floyd, that outfit is atrocious. Gratz tank
Santa Cruz held his own and was doing damage until David landed that 1 lucky bomb
So much for Tank's so called "low IQ". Seems like the "low IQ" dude was the one who made all the adjustments and scored the KO of the year.
Ya can tell when Floyd was talking,,,  The emotions man... his father and uncle and Lenard big nose raised him so right in the world of boxing and helping the man next to him on his team
Great fight for the champ no antics needed just good boxing keep going !
Mayweather will never match him up with someone that could beat him in his prime, he's his cash cow, he'll make Lopez wait till he's past his prime before he agrees to fight him, like they did with his own career, he's all about the money, he has no interest in making real fights.
knockout
I hope they putting money into Upton gym. Need more champions coming out of there.
Can't forget Tank Has Mike Tyson's Blessing &That Uppercut was Nothing Short Of 💪🏾👍🏾
That power is too much for 130 them body shots just do too much damage
Tank been doing his thing ever since he separated from Adrien Broner and plugged into Floyd
On god this niggas reflex is on a 1000 look how he looking around 😂💯 he ah GOAT
THE THING IS ONCE HE STICKS WITH FLOYD HE WILL MAKE WAKE WAY MORE MONEY . AND HE WILL CHOOSE HIS OPPONENTS WISELY. FLOYD KNOWS THE VALUE OF AN UNBEATEN RECORD.
Floyd trying to take all that custom off lol 🎩 👓 😷 😂😂😂
Growth. Tank is going next level
Davis its time to fly solo be your own  boss
Is floyd starting growing his hair back
i warn cruz about that pacman left hand  tank have tank was trying hard for that upper cut and he got in  rd  6  its good for cruz he learn agood lesson  i no tank     have   a  bad pacman  left  hand
Floyd looking like the Black Leprechaun
🍒 pick of the year! Take on somebody your own size
Tank Got good people around him to shape his career to become a pound for pound champion for the long Hall TMT people hate just like his boss but it's always good to ce them prove people wrong this is one of his highlight fights will always be talked about
I want Canelo to come out in African colors next fight. Tank Davis vs Victor Pasillas!! Mega fight!!
Argentina te ama Davis cómprame una casa
Congratulations tank .. Lopez is in trouble hahaha
Floyd u got u a great Champion but i know u gone make him even greater!
Congratulations tank .. Lopez is in trouble hahaha
Leo is a warrior he’ll be back better than ever👊🏾
I like tank man, but his coach was giving him game. He might not remember but his coach was telling him great things.
Every Dog has it's Day
Davis need that ko cause Leo was giving it to him. But know I now there no way Davis gonna beat Garcia or Lopez
That was a great card bra
Stay with Floyd dawg!
Can't help but like tank ... Well done leo for being game 👌 good win tank 👍
Did y’all see floyd and Calvin battling for attention
Congrats TANK, #TBE
This kid has a heart  The beautiful words for his opponent and Leo’s dad  very humble guy.       Respect that
Ya ll boy's killing the boxing game right now Money Team! That black & red pimping !
Ain’t that special? Floyd dressed up as a smart guy for Halloween. Read what’s on that water bottle for us boy
This time i agree floyd lets take the boxers holiday.
Stay with your coach!!!
Congratulations to Gervonte Davis on a great win!!! I'm definitely a fan.
Coach Calvin saved this young man's life.
Tank Davis still not ready for Lomachenko.  Loma is too match for Tank.
Im very proud of tank and his team. Tank you have matured alot not only in the wring but out side as well you have spoken very maturely and thats a true champ. Like maywether sed take your time enjoy your family and let the best of the best handle who you gon fight. Fuck every one els and there opinions. You did good shit you did grate champ.
I think Leo exposed tank, if teofimo Ryan or Haney lands hands on him like that he’ll go to sleep for sure. Leo don’t have power and was still backing him up and saw him feel his power in various occasions
Floyd is the prime example that all the money in the world can’t buy you style
I was expecting a k.o in the 1st round lol
It Is very funny that clown with hat  next to garvonta !
West coast here come tank
Tank was getting the ass whooped before he caught leo
Very humble out the ring keep up the good work Shot out to the Money team 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
GIVE COACH HIS CREDITS
Teofimo whoops Davis!! 100%
How on earth can you not like this kid now?
No disrespect to Floyd Mayweather I know that he's an integral part of the team but he doesn't need to be on the podium don't take away from the the Fighter's and the coach's night
Floyd is the P. Diddy of boxing. "All up in the videos, dancing" [Suge Knight voice]   Damn man.. let Tank and Calvin shine.
tank coo ! Floyd just annoying
Floyd gotta get this kid coached up for post interviews... He gotta take some speech classes and not be to humble... Ask your mentor what got him his bread...
Floyd 2024
I just came here to see how Floyd would make this interview about him lol
I mean he did fight a smaller fighter who came up 2 weight classes he was set up to win and if Leo wouldve won it wouldve blown back up on floyd but this fight dont mean nothing until he fights names in his division he will be some to talk about not hating just spitting facts he should fight loma now that teo solved the puzzle he was to scared to solve himself but knowing he works with floyd they gonna keep ducking the big names and take these advantageous fights why make his cash cow lose.  shout out to leo for having the balls to take this fight knowing he was in a disadvantage
Weak ass fight everybody knew he was going to beat this little bitty guy...
Fight tyson
Good job to leo for going in to fight tank..💯💪
Did floyd sound sick or just me...
Floyd Mayweather lost a fight to the microphone
The making of a true champion. Stay humble and vicious.
Its time to give Ryan Garcia A Shot Tank!
Floyd with that Pimp Hat on!
Andre 3000 promotions 😂😂😂
I felt that horrible uppercut right here in Dubai, I sincerely feel so sorry for Leo. Tank was just the better dude❤ Love'em both❤🥊❤
all  your  fights been  TKO they don't have  that to shin with that
Floyd Looks Annoyed By The Repetitive Questions. 😂😂
your records looks better than any others career no L at all
Floyd took the towel from between gervonta and calvin ford. Ford better keep an eye out
great fight,  i like gervonta he does not run,  he comes to fight, the best man won tonight. espectacular knockout.
don't use trash rapper to come out with you you a star use star money upgrade rappers
congratulations go enjoy your richest with your family again keep prayed stay focused nothing but success in your life & feature enjoyed
I like Floyd's goofy Halloween costume.
That mic kicking Floyd’s a$$
Props to Leo for his performance against Tank keeping up with him. Just that tank is too powerful with that Tyson uppercut
I believe having two head coach just one gone get exsppuose you know what the people  say what's in dark come to the light
Floyd needs to back the fuck up bro ... shit .. give his trainer some credit they been together ever since he was a kid
You can really see through his authenticity, he has big heart.  In & out the ring.  I think he understands from May weather now...if he stays focused & listens to Floyd & his team for the next 5-6 years.  He’ll make 2-300M & be ready to retire.
My question is why did you cover your body on the night of weigh in?lol
bro take licks & keep ticking
Truly a genuine guy!! To show that towards Leo proved a lot to me about Tank!!
Maybe it’s just me ,  but Floyd gotta let Calvin do his job . A fighter can’t listen 2 voices during a fight
I’m looking at this interview and I see more than just boxing , I see successful black business men !! Facto
Coach Calvin has humility in spades in addition to knowledge. Floyd has a big presence, yet Coach doesn't budge or change. That's a team for you.
stay humble & prosperity to&fro the whole team
Ask about credible opponents and get the usual answers smh
Floyd jumps from Devon haney to tank Davis tank should dump floyd he doesn’t need him
I'm so tired of people saying he is too big for these fighters, boxing has weight classes for a reason. Leo's weight is more spread out which gives him the reach advantage, Tank is more compact which gives him a power advantage. Both of these guys weighed in at 129 a day ago so Tank is not bigger but yes he is stronger. If the fight would have went 12 rounds and Tank would have lost by decision, you wouldn't want to hear any excuses from Tank so stop with the bullshit excuses for Leo. Tank is the truth and the rest of his fights has to be against name opponents because he is now a ppv star and box office so when he slowly start dropping the so called stars, keep that same energy hater, Baltimore is so proud of you Tank, glad to hear you are planning to move to Vegas to stay focus and in shape.  Bmore's finest doing us proud, the Champ is here 👊🏾 Iron Tank Davis
Shout to Calvin to..and floyd 💪💪💯
This is one talented boxer known for being undisciplined that needs management like Floyd to be disciplined.
I was going for Leo, I’m Mexican, and we tend to always support the Mexican boxer.  But Davis is a stand up guy, Davis landed that vicious uppercut.  Congrats to him and his team.  Davis won me as a fan being a respectful after the fight.  Legit was worry about Leo after he was still not moving and gave his pops a shoutout.  Mad Respect Davis! You won a Mexican fan.  You have a bright future young champ.
I really didn't see any had a or combination but the too was a pretty upper cup
Tank, get away from Floyd if you don’t wanna get the rep he gets. You are a great fighter dont stain your legacy the way he did.
Floyd Mayweather with the classy behavior.
I liked Tank before but I’m definitely a fan now. Mad respect to him and his camp for the job well done and the fact that with the talent he’s got there wasn’t trash talk prior or post fight is great to see. He just knows he’s a great fighter. Props to both fighters.
Tank a good humble dude.
floyd went with Malcolm x for Halloween
Tank congrats  ! Mention your coach 1st NOT FOYLD . Calvin is the one who put you in this position !
imagine being on the team with the brilliance of Coach Calvin, experience of Floyd Mayweather, and the unstoppable Gervonta Davis.
You got different( options)to knock them out tank...Explore em...
Tank has a heart of gold 💯🙏 a true Champ
His humble And classy champion. I respect that.
That's so stupid That's a classic punch I cannot believe it he eat that punch OMG...leo need to work in his defense...
Hope he calls out Lopez and KOs him next!
Tank you the man brotha. Beast status was in display. Thanks for the show. Can't wait for you're next one.
Floyd don’t wanna talk about other fighters because he knows TANK  ISNT READY
If he didn't have Floyd, he would be the next Tyson.......in all the wrong ways.  You can see him trying to be a good person.  I feel like floyd is turning him into a good man.
When hype jobs get attention for beating a cherry pick
Good fight tank,walkedright into them punches applying pressure to him..dropped him..well done get back in the gym..whos next..back to back
Worse cherry pick ever Tank shouldn't get credit for this fight
Humble tank Davis great champ from a Leo fan
Floyd attention seeker... let Tank have his moment...
Congrats to Tank Davis great champion, he beat my boy Leo Santa Cruz  even though I knew this would probably happen..hope he remains successful for a long time and fights all the top guys. Great Job Champ from a Mexican fight fan.
And y’all want tank to fight Ryan 🤣 yeah ok
Floyd might as well be his trainer too.
Tank is a real stand up dude all the best to him
Davis is an absolute warrior and a good human too. you can tell he real  For example at 10:40 when they asked him what Rd he felt like he started taking over. He said 4th rd at first but was like "naw 5th rd actually". He's keepin it 100
Tank...You made a lot of us proud of what you’ve achieved already. Not just the knockouts, but, being disciplined and growing as a individual.That’s what all of us should be doing. Stay humble and congratulations on the win.
Tank already had Lopez doing the 2step in the ring sparing tank by knockout
respect floyd and tank. Congrats tank and TMT
i use to i use to be i use to be same kid... yah yah enough already bro give kid his own credit without ur Money mayweather BS... like dude u were a decent boxer kinda most boring ive seen in my lifetime at least last 5 yrs... where Deonte at??? Now thats a fighter
So tank fights at 135...how can anyone give him that much credit for pulling up a 126 pd fighter??? Ridiculous!! Of course he’s supposed to knock LSC out!!! Funny how Mayweather promotions afraid of getting him in the ring with Teo! Mayweather actually said that Tank  is not ready for Lopez right now! Let’s see tank step in against guys in his own division and that are actually in their prime! No more 45 year olds with torn Achilles or boxers he found sleeping next to a garbage can! Step in with Teo, Garcia, Haney and really show what your made of! Until then there is no credit from me!
I hope Tank stays with his trainer for the duration of his career. Can’t teach God given chemistry.
Teofino Vs Tank 2
Tank is the best at 130-135 don't no fighter want to see him let's be 100 no fighter
Floyd is teaching Tank all he learned from his Father, his Uncle and Himself. Wow, what a future this kid have. Sandtown baby. Baltimore we rooting for him.
great job for sure,, he has worked hard harder then most and it pays off.. only thing is he always sayin hes not gonna let money and fame change who he is and he is sitting there barking orders at everyone to get his phone and his shirt and didnt say thanx once.. figures mayweather rubbing off on him lil too much... they all think there above people cause of how much money they make/have and thats the worst kind of people trust me ive been up and ive been down and in between and i have never treated anyone by how much there worth if only humans could change this one thing the world would be better place!!!!!!
Floyd out here protecting lol tank isn’t ducking nobody but Floyd  controlling who he fight
This was Mayweather vs DaLahoya PT 2
Leo "6th round" Santa SNOOZE, lol 💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
Floyd is a good voice for tank. He always been that guy who speaks up. They aint finna pressure tank into calling people out with floyd there.
I’m Mexican ... but I like this guy because he is not like mayweather ... he fights... and he doesn’t talk shit.
Floyd can come out of retirement and still whoop everybody then go back into retirement just to show everybody how good he is
Buen campeon   eso lo ase grande cuando dijo que lo más importante es que leo estaba bien y los dos volvieron a casa sanos y salvos grande  tanque
Yea Floyd putting him in a position already lol he hasn’t fought a black guy from the same struggle the same streets as him yet he putting him in the best positions lol shit obvious he’s a great fighter but he’s picking fights he anit fought nobody from the hood yet but good fight
Floyd looks like he's got bean pies and oils for sale
A good big fighter beat a good small fighter, that is all! There’s weight classes for a reason. There was absolutely no surprise here!
Mayweather stfu please, its tank's day
I know it’s not in your bloodline to do so but money Mayweather get some rest big dod you deserve it🤴🏾🤴🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
Great champion,  Hubble outside . Beast inside the rign
He so cool
Great fully done by the new .And soon we will see the take over against the New .Live on Sho Time.💪💪
Why Floyd always gotta make it about him lol
Don’t never turn your back on Coach Calvin. When u win he wins. Beautiful. I see the glow in his face.
3x champion at 130. I'm glad to see tank doing so well. Silent assassin from over West.
Fight an American
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 As a fighter Floyd is a goat and was my favorite fight but damn he’s annoying. That train is never late. He says he wants Tank to enjoy this time but he’s always talking about himself. We know you’re 50-0, made more money than anyone else, a son in boxing but don’t take the shine off of your top fighter.
Hey there was an awesome backyard it’s a shame is mixed up with Floyd all in only about money Mayweather. Go get your money somewhere else Floyd but these young men make their own way.
I was going for my boy Leo... Really glad he okay... but mad respect for Tank... and I'm new Tank fan... I dont see anyone beating him right know at 130 or 135 ... Maybe Lopez at 135  but my money in Tank...
Tank I see and hear the growth in you I'm so happy to see a young blackman become a strong blackman I love the growth bro.stay on this path u will not go wrong by moving to Vegas and focusing on your career.stay focus that how floyd stayed on top for so long peace
Amazing fight Champs that was a wonderful knockout 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿. Tank Davis👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Baltimore Stand up!!! Yeah Tank
Respect to tank when he shout out Leo dad  Knowing what situation he is going through.
Idk why I cringe nowadays when I here Floyd speak but big big ups to Tank Davis, he's going to be dominant for a long time
If yall can't show by example, stop being haters Floyd made this man rich and protects the young king from all the scum bags.. Including fake ass divisive media bullshit...
GREAT KNOCKOUT....GREAT FIGHT....I FEEL LEO SANTA CRUZ WAS POORLY ADVICE TO TAKE THIS FIGHT THERE WAS NOT WAY TO WIN THIS FIGHT. THE ONLY GUY WHO STANDS A CHANCE IS TEOFIMO LOPEZ.
Calvin laying back chilling just being the coach supporting his fighter because he knows he put the work in to get Tank into this position! Floyd should just really lay back and this young shine! Great Job team Tank!
Floyd Mayweather the Great.
How is Floyd possibly making this about himself?  He's literally celebrating Tank.  He's not a scrub he comes from the same world as Tank and when Floyd talks next to Tank about Tank it gives Tank more exposure.
Beware! Count your money Gervonta
No disrespect to Floyd one of the Best but Tank Davis has natural talent and training team has been with him for year's give Calvin Ford his credit
That punch snapped Santa Cruz momma back straight
The tank is the right nickname for him good shtt
Tank is ready for Teofimo Lopez  https://youtu.be/wKamItEoYiU
for Lomachenko easy job!
WHAT A VERY LUCKY PUNCH
Anyone notice they promoting Conor McGregor's whiskey!! Guess they dont hate each other after all.
Why not trow a little hot sauce on the topic of who's next ,,,, Anybody can get it... He said it in the post fight   Good fight  respect to  tank , Leo is a warrior  but the best man one. Tank needs to be a little more colorful when talking . Let's see who Goin to whant the smoke  next
Canelo  vs amir khan 2!  Thats what this fight was . But good things are happening in boxing
WHERE IS FLOYDS LENSES
Ryan garcia,don't want none of tank. And haney can forget it. Coach calvin and floyd, great job. And to all deese mayweather haters, not once did I see mayweather in the corner
Floyd is doing a wonderful job with this young mans career!
Davis vs Teo Lopez...... number 1 fight of all the divisions.
True Champion 🏆🏆🏆🙏🙏🙏 Many blessings to Tank and his whole team and his family
Taylor made cherries 🍒 ppl all hyped liked we didn’t kno this was gone happen I’m not impressed the man threw same punch twice against the ropes lol 😂 reminds me wilder until equal skill  fighter fights him  good work doe
What yall think about pacman vs either Davis or Lopez at 140?
Floyd think he doing everything. He had his time he should lay back and let new king take his throne. Floyd being annoying af.
This black guy won because leo was the smaller guy wait till he goes against devin haney or teofimo lopez
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ The maturity in the answers❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That trainer Kevin is the key been with him since a kid why Floyd got try steal the show.SMH!Congratulations Tank
Spoken like a true gentleman
Had to work so didn’t see fight yet but glad Tank Won. Would have been salty if someone hurt my WCM.
Im gonna watch the fight again, see if he can dodge that upper cut 😅
was leo's ass ferried to the emergency room after the fight?
Floyd had a hard time figuring out how that mic stand worked in the end some guy had to come do it for him 😭
Floyd have to make everything about him, please let Tank shine on his own.
I’ve always been a mayweather fan, and I’m Mexican, but I think I found my new favorite boxer.
Check out money may with the bow tie😆 great fight tank your going to be the person to beat
Hate when floyd speaks for tank..nobody spoke for floyd at his press conferences but him..floyd wouldn't even had allowed someone to speak for him in his prime..taking the mic from tank smdh..let tank speak in his best victory in his career..he the one that fought
Tyson Fury, Álvarez, bigger and better pound for pound best. Tank got the little boy belt.
He got his Sammy Davis Mayweather Jr outfit on!🤣🤣🤣
Floyd really retired now. He grew his hair out.
I can sense a power struggle between Coach Calvin and Floyd over Tank and it looks like Floyd is winning smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
That uppercut was clean!
Mayweather is 50-1 with that damn 🎤  lmao
(Rematch) make this a trilogy best thing I have see so far in 2020 the anticipation of the fight matched the intensity!!...
My videos are the most ILLEST out here
Please look at my videos
I AM KAZARTAKON
My videos are like Davis uppercut, they raw
My rap videos are different, please look at my page
What a shocker, he knocked out a guy with average power going up two  weight classes, who was out-boxing him until the knock out, and they are  talking about it as he just knocked out Lomachenko, shameless cherry  picking at its best.
This young man has the world at his feet and he has showed such maturity for his age nuff respect to Floyd Mayweather and his team 👊
Oh My Gawd! Devastating Blow it “Was” Looking like a Draw until that Upper Cut shout out to Santa Cruz! glad he recovered he stayed down for awhile but Santa Cruz is a young Lion love that dude!! much respect Gervonta make them respect the Champ Much love and Respect!! For both fighters 💯💯
F rayn garcia punch u. U will have a dangerous life
Floyd out here sounding like somebody Gpa.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everybody i know said ko in 6. Crazy.
Floyd, as great as he is, should stop doing what Ray Leonard did! He always seem to talk about himself at some point when the show is about  another fighter
Floyd can't wait to talk
I get the Floyd praises but your coach right ✅ there say his name first.
Good as fighter  as for Garcia and Hanley
I don’t know if people are realizing that Floyd is basically dictating Gervonta Davis Carrer lmao Floyd seems to know Gervonta more Than Gervonta lol
Davis and Floyd been woppin Mexxikans left and right since 2005 😂😂😂😂😭
This fight pretty much went the way I expected it to Go. Congratulations to the Davis camp.
I helped him  when  i  was writing a year ago that he had a disgusting personality when he was hanging out and drinking a lot as oligofrénic persons does. Now he knows i was helping him with my opinión. If he does it again i will help him again and again. I still help people in the wrong way of life. Now í am telling recently to floy that stop showing material stuffs, because that shows me that he is not really happy. How can you be happy with a big house. But not a home with an intelligent an noble wife with beautifuil children around.  ¿ capiche? A lot of cars and a plane.  But, not truthfull friends.
Splash’n💦👀
Santa Cruz was doing pretty good but he sat in the fire a lil too long. Ate some good shots and everything but you cant just hang around with a big puncher like that. Either way, Santa Cruz had heart man. Much respect to that guy man
Good fight, even better K.O
Damn I should put some money on this one
He’s the man to beat. Power speed and becoming a great all around boxer. Scary
I comment on his knockout. I’m serious that punch had my ears ringing
