Justin Herbert
faze got no drip

Destroying you should play in the NFL for the chiefs
so since the rams also play here does that mean there are three different locker rooms and two different sides of the stadium for each team?
4:26 lil bit sus

Respectfully sofi stadium is the #RAMSHOUSE. let's get this right ✅️
Casting couch vibes hahahaha 😂😂
I am flabbergasted
GOAT
"you treat the janitor like you treat the GM... CAN I GET SOME DIFFERENT SIZE HELMETS AND PADS IN HERE" ... OK BRUH.
Bruh this man skin....🤦🏿‍♂️
rams chairman owns sofi.....
Damn, the league you never made it to
Whatever that is in his hair was making me mad
he's using Keenan Allens locker
The most unathletic video he has ever posted.
Hey Dee should of said at the end look at camera “That is some COLD Sh#t They just did” leaving you like that haha
Lmaooo I thought he was joking when he said 6 star kicker. Bro really a kickee
The one kid with orange shoes looks like a make a wish kid
Change your name to Faze Deestroying
casting couch vibe😭😭
Faze is joke noob 😆
Ya I'm sorry but don't ever call this chargers stadium. This is rams house. Chargers just rent a room.
13:03 … Look how they massacred my boy
Not the socks in the ice bath
Athleticism is not something any of these gamers got in life. It hurt to watch them run.
How much did it cost to rent the stadium?
Bro can punt though
Damn bro you got a BOOT
Booya unathletic asf 😂
Dee is offensive pass interference 8 times outta 10.
Keep up the work
Are you faster than Tyreek Hill
i can feel the coldness throw the screen
(I don’t play football) when do you not do up the gloves
At SoFi stadium look up on the left side of the roof decor and saulute to deestroying amazing punt
He broke the screen....
My grandson is a big fan he have Ben watching you for 4 yers
This man faze rug doesnt play football, and he shouldnt try not tryna be cruel, just honest
In the thumbnail you can see the same people in the stands 😂
rams house change my mind
Do they change the bolt up thing every week cuz that mainly rams house or do they have different rooms
So we just gone ignore that he broke the Jumbotron with a kick ? Unreal 😂
I guess D's goal is to be better than somebody 🤷
Booya just there wanting to  360 scope some kids 😂
How much y'all think that cost to repair that damage he did to the roof at the beginning of the video?
Aye i love you gang but don't let no dude open your shower curtain again broski lol
"I wonder if I could hit that?" *Me already knowing he bout to hit sum*
YO MAN, YOU SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP THAT GIANT ASS NEON BOARD SON!!! THAT SHIT GONNA COST HELLA DOLLRS
I have a question do you  play the  nefl

Someone fix how rug holds the football that gets on my nerves seeing people hold the football like that
this video is sponsored by geology *hits the big screen with a punt*
7 year old me would probably believe this
Looking back this sound like a Mr Beast Title
Its funny because rug runs the same route almost all the time
Faze rug
Jesus loves you all he died on the cross for you I pray and I believe that you will find him weather that'd be today or another day. Jesus loves you all AMEN!!!!!!! <3
We need an MMG collab
faze bro start working out bro. 😎
the faze clan links in this is so obvious 😅
Isaiah 41:10 (NIV) "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
It ain’t the chargers stadium it’s the LA rams stadium get it right!!! Go rams!!!!

I own seats and they are my fav team
yo deestroying your my best youtuber keep up the good work

this one faze guy runs like a little kid😂 that shit looks so funny😂😂🥶
Eww the San Diego chargers. The tab the raiders beat to ensure no playoffs for them. Joey Bosa thinking he could put away the raiders. Enjoy your fat L and still never having a single championship ring. Rams have one, 49ers have multiple rings, raiders too. Must suck to be the wannabe team that failed
Please join chargers 💯💯
Deestry=oying destroying NFL stadiums lol
Santana
The dab
Tell nfl to recruit this dude
10:31 faze rug looks so odd the way he standing
lol
I hate when people say sofi stadium is the home of the chargers it’s not it’s the home of the Rams and yes I know they share the same stadium.
IS THIS GUY SERIOUS?!!! WHOSE HOUSE??? THATS THE RAMS HOUSE, F@CK THE CHARGERS....WHO ARE THEY?! WE THE ONES WHO WON THE SUPERBOWL AND YOU DEFINE THE STADIUM AS CHARGERS STADIUM...THIS GUY IS WACK..

Lets be HONEST...That's the RAMS STADIUM...The Chargers are just TENANTS!!  (A former Charger fan who lives in S.D.)
I like Dees but he way more athletic than the rest of those dudes no comp.
No lie... This was the weakest 1 on 1 I've ever seen. I'm going to the other one's. You're literally the only real athlete there. 🤷🏾‍♂️💯

I'm really surprised Deestroying hasn't ventured down to see Westlake in Austin, Texas. They're the #2 team in the nation - #1 public school - and just won their third state title in a row. The school's also the home of Drew Brees, Nick Foles, and Justin freaking Tucker.
I thought it was gonna be dem Florida niccas dere🤦🏾‍♂️
Where are the Rams lockers located?

Can i borrow $100,000 until I get 1 million subscribers and I pay you back? Please sir.
Bro just Deestroyed the jumbo tron 💀
The way he keeps talking about the chargers picking him up, he sounds like a old dude who tells everyone he woulda went pro if it wasn’t for a bum knee 😂😂
Breaking stadiums
Support👍👍👍
Man 1v1 never has been a fair challenge.      If the receiver doesn’t win 75 Percent of the time then the receiver  just sucks balls. As far as the kicking…….I don’t see why someone hasn’t signed you yet
