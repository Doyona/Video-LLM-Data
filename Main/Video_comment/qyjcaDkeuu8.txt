Flight the 99 ovr excuse creator
“Flight team stand up !! Flight team sit down”.
We need adin ross vs flight
Flight said he have not played basketball for like 20 years, I think he should keep it that way.
6:38 he freaks out over a normal ass 3😂
Damb Jesser got some nice shot on that one and so dose flight
2:22 that was nasty
Flight needs better stamina because he is so tired and can’t defend
L
Jesser got that strap
Yesssss
Flight got better
better than ben simmons
Tbh i would beat flight he might have the height but does he have the courage to shoot over my freaking roach defense lol
What the hell is that shot!!!!
I’ll 1v1 flight and end his basketball career
yo im a true flight fan  but like his shot is just as broke as speeds
usuck
Flight really does suck at basketball
No one can honestly think flight is any good, the worst jump shot I’ve ever seen from 3 or for a 2 his form is terrible, guy has no handles
Obviously flight is never gonna be some superstar player but, he really has gotten better and it’s awesome to see him have fun with it
Bro not gonna lie your jump shot is trash
Flight still trash as usual
Flight got that hof follow your shot
Flight you are trash play tennis or something basketball is not for you,just focused on youtube.
Flight was on fire!
Both are very bad and get thousands of dollars for this whackshit🤦🏼‍♂️
Flight got that hall of fame brick machine badge
Jesser looks big as fuck😩
Its june
Bruh just stick to reacting lol
He could be a rebound god
He shoots worst the a 5 year old 😂
you should not keep on running right after shooting improve your shots to the point you can relax after shooting
y'all too ez bruh kids level basketball
With the amount of traveling in this video y’all could’ve gone on vacation
Yo u was funny if u thaught u were gonna beat jesser😂😂
How tall is jesser?
Flight 3-10 on twos which is 30%. Alright.
Is it just me or is flight's shot ugly asf?
For a guy wearing a Ben Simmons Jersey, he’s doing good. NGL
7:45🤣😂🤣😂
how u got no badges in June
After all his training... he is still making bad decisions with the ball(his shot selection). Your form is still bad, bro. Its like you forgot everything they taught you.🤦🏽‍♀️
I COULD TAKE FLIGHT EASY,, N IM 510. CURRY NEW BORN SHOOTS BETTER THAN HIM NGL
The thing is that’s cashes court 😂
8:00 Dr. Jekyll 8:16 Mr. Hyde
Where some more irls flight???
No offense to flight but he was giving way to much space on defense and only reaching his hand out like a 5th grader
flight is so shit
This guy really has on a Simmons jersey
Jesser with the travel
cmon man
Flight at 50%
Give your life to God it will be the best decision you ever made🙏🏾 I promise I love u and God loves u more that he sent his only begotten son Jesus Christ our lord and savior to die for our sins❤️
everything got better except for your defense
Flights jumper is wetter than my sprinkler
The king of 1v1s
6:40 that jumpshot doe
How y’all going to say June flight after he’s only dropped one 1v1 in June and no the 1v1 against his girlfriend up to 3 pta doesn’t count as a 1v1.... only one 1v1 it’s mid June dude is slacking

Imagen if flight was in the fight YouTubers vs tiktokers
Flight v 5 yr prodigy
Flight, you suck. You need to quit cus your just so bad.

At least flight was competitive in this game.
Yo bro on god I’ll let you beat me to boost your record and then I’ll beat Cash so you can say you beat someone who beat him! 🤣🤣🤣 hit my line
Flight has good handles good effort but he needs to slow down his shot and take his time.

Flight lookin buff
Jesse makes these tough insane shot and flight makes as layup: INSTANT REPLAY
Best shots 6:36 7:55 8:05
Best shots 6:36 7:55

Rada buda
We need Aidan VS Flight Next
NEXT MONTHS QUOTE  “You though I was go let this slideeee, we in the month of Julyyy”🤧

Everyone saying flight got better but ignoring how SMOOTH and nice jesser is. Remids me of pg and luka mixed
Anyone else notice whenever you type in “flightreacts” on YouTube trying to find this channel it’s super hard unless you go to filters and click on “channels?” Only NOTYOURAVERAGEFLIGHT pops up when you type in flightreacts now.

FLIGHT DOES NOT WANT TO PLAY ME IN JUNE💯💪🏻 IM TO MUCH FOR JUNE FLIGHT😈 HE WANTS NO SMOKE💯 I WILL DROP OFF JUNE FLIGHT, LET HIM KNOW
Flight hasn’t gotten faster. The thing is he’s clearly improved his ball handling skills. It’s allowing him to move quicker with the ball.
JUNEEEEE FLIGHT!!!!!
FLIGHTS ON STEROIDS!!!
june flight is like the myth thats actually true somehow
Still ass but handles from him got better
Jesser is not playing bad
Cmon flight it’s June 🤦🏽‍♂️

Good game boys. I like the hustle flight
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless..,,
Can't believe it's already been a year since June time flies
FLIGHT TEAM SIT DOWN
June don’t claim you  Your August flight now 🤦🏾‍♂️
The tiny statement quickly smell because glove amazingly knit from a hurt weed. parallel, guttural H habitual history

I like how he’s so trash that he has to replay him making a layup
Gio is next

5:52 he took 4 steps before dribbling and then 3 more on the step back...🤦‍♂️
Bro where is your other 1v1

flight built different June flight 4L😭
No cap jesser a beast🔥

flight needs to stop thinking about getting the rebound when he shoots… he wouldn’t have to do that if he just makes the shot
How tall is Jesser
When you realize they haven't patched zens in real life
Are you not done taking Ls
JUNE FLIGHT!!!
Flight should 1 v 1 Gio Wise 😂
June

Flight just needs better shot iq.
Dog flight has  that Shawn Marion game that ugly quick release
Jesser got taller
Flights always trying to make 3s like curry he needs to starts going for more layups and lay off the long shots
U know he gone miss run he start running before the ball hit the rim
Yo flight react to cam wilders 1v1 against R2
Jesser slowest man ever
These dudes both trash lemme get a 1v1 against any of these dudes or anybody on 2 hype or t jass Idc I'm dropping them off sorry
Flight put more ark on your shot and you’re going to sinc it
I could beat flight with only my right hand and playing zero defense what did I just watch
Flight just keep that follower through up when you shoot it help
🔥😈🐐🥶
Jesser becomes Damian Lillard
flight kinda look like spiderman on defence
How y’all youtubers not laugh when flight throws up wild shit 😂
Imagine being so ass you got people giving you one month to be good. Happy that June Flight is back tho
5:42 🤦‍♂️
with the shirt it’s just flight, without the shirt it’s JUNE  FLIGHT 🐐
Look like same flight to me😑
“There is some con si pir here man”
Yoo flight airballed only twice??? Big W
Jesser is so awkward sum times
How has flight been "training since july" but still gets gassed like 2 points into the game
Am i the only one that gets super annoyed at the replays everytime flight scores
man this aint no 1v1 without trash talking
Flight looks a lot more comfortable now. His jump shots looks a whole lot better than before. Nice work Flight!!!!
How did he get even worse from last year 😭
flight a tryhard
11-8 WE MAKING PROGRESS!!!
stop rushin you out of breath before halftime dude 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
cut the cameras
For some reason with that tank top I thought he gained muscle
emotional
@flightreacts hey what editing software did you use for your avatar ?
Dude how is flight this much of a brick
This June Flight gotta pop out.
Bro flight needs to ask Lonzo how he fixed his shop😂
6:36
Flight is too sloppy hes rushing when he drives to the basket and kets not talk about the jumper
6'3" for no reason
Super proud of flight
You look like a different player now..... Keep working hard young bro
The instant replays always get me
We got Flight and the rest are nobody’s.
Jesser is so humble
ayo why does flight sound hood
Jesser looks so slow, slow jump shot, dribbling is slow
Flight took an l but this is his best game yet prove me wrong
Flight why u still scared of driving to the hoop when ur 6’3
Jesser is a wholesome human being
Flight said forget what he learned from training 😭😭
Put in all that “work” and u still buns🤣
Ayyyt... I sees you Flight. No too shabby with that flick of that wrist!!
We need Adin v Flight
FLIGHT?!🤣😂
Flight work on your stamina
what happened the dog got shot??
Flight  be looking like a praying mantis after he shoot .lol
flight the type to lose to a guy in a wheelchair cus he keep shooting threes
I’m not joking flight doesn’t look horrible his release has gotten a lot better still needs to be fixed but last year he was an absolute joke.
Fligh everything is good but the 10inch jumps💀
Jesser is the luka of yt like this bucket at 5:13 is so Luka esc
We know Jesse could have scored everyone possession is he wanted to
finally some improvement
Each like is a yes to adin vs flight
I’m sorry but get me a game with both of those guys, I’m smoking them, book it!!!
Flight you need to work on your form.
Flight needs to fix his arc and release if he plans on shooting as much as he does. He definitely needs to drive more because he’s definitely improved on handling.   Flights improving. if he continues to practice and sets up more games I could definitely see him winning some, or atleast putting up a good fight.
Flight really playing against Luka Doncic
8:16 made my year HAHAHAHA
Look like NBA Ballers court
he's been hooping for a few years now and he still cant shoot properly
Watching these guys make me realize that everyone at my park is actually good 😂
I only disliked so the dislikes wouldn’t be 66* now it’s 667 good vid tho🔥
50 on trending
Seeing this man chase his rebounds is so hilarious😭😭😭😭💀
when its 10-6 and the videos almost over  *finish him*
I guess Flight never changed🤷🏽‍♂️😈
He trash tell him to 1v1 me
Tell flight his sorry has hell
TJ jass
The form😂
That intro though😄😄💯
Flight looks like he put on some weight 💪🏽
Lol flight got good enough to be just bad but not terrible
they are so out of shape
No ones gonna talk ab the travel at 4:33 😭
Y y’all so out of breath damn
Instant replay on every made shot by flight🤣🤣🤣🤣
jesser let him score when he was up 10-1 it was so obvious
Flight needs to go to a team like the heat or the warriors
It’s JUNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEaeaeaea
All that weed got u tired as hell
This sad
Crazy how relevant Flight is to basketball yet he cant hooo 😂
Not sure if they ballin or acting
6:40 look at the follow through man so inspirational.
Atleast Flight is better than Kuzma
6:23 was more than a miss😂
Dear person that's reading this, we don't know each others but I wish you all the best in life ❤️ don't ever blame yourself, accept things and go forward. Your smile is precious and a key for happy life.  Love from a small YouTuber🖤

Flight been better ever since cash burned them shoes of his
Look at flight man, so inspirational
June is already a failure smh
Jesser look good add shoulder and half spins when taking it to the hole
ITS JUUUUUUUNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE😈😈😈
Hearing “it’s juuuuuuuuuuune” for the first time since last year brings me so much joy
flight just rushes his shot, he needs to settle down and shoot with more confidence
jesser looking like luka lmao
8:16 I’m dead🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Flight just need to work on his shot and the strength in his layups
That stepback in the beginning was in slow motion lol
Why was the a highlight for flights open three but not for jessers shamgod step back three or Jesse's blocks
Flight u Need to train your shoot fam trust us bro im for real
Jezzer breathing like he smoke weed all day
Flight Got bigger N He looking Better need some more Work On his form But he got better Overall. Anyone Agree?
good shit flight 🔥
I can’t believe people actually watch flight for basket ball like he actually sucks no cap no hate lol
"Gotta hustle" but can't hustle cause he can't stop wheezing. Cracks me up every time.
Jesser looked like he barely even tried
Flight should just try to up his vert so he can dunk he is like 6'2-6'3 or something like that.
This mans jumper tho
flight is the worst player i’ve ever seen in my life
Jesser playin fake defense lol
It's fucking JUNNEEEEE
Flight Curry ?
IIITTTTTSSSSS JJJJJUUUUUNNNNNEEEEE   m
7:36 one 3 out of all those misses and he chased his shot 😂
I swear he’s set built like a shorter Luka
Jesser moves in slow motion
Flight getting goodddd

jesser got magnets in his hand and in the rim
It’s JUUUUNNNNEE!!!!!
https://youtu.be/1LaFdL9Z8l0 fantastic

So we not gon talk about the way he turned around? 8:11
nobody gonna talk about the huge ass travel at 4:30 ?? 🤣😂
Flight im sorry but your jump shot kinda trash
Flight has loyal supporters. The fact his fans actually watch any of his 1 v1 is crazy. Cause he still sucks 😂
Random question: can we have a update on your baby flight
Flight shoots with the intention of missing
4:30 jesser traveled so hard, cant lie this is so entertaining!
The dear select trivially fail because week exemplarily strengthen upon a dramatic treatment. clever, joyous garlic
So inspirational
look at Flight man, so inspirational
flight still on YouTube?
my man flight is ass water
You always losing even with girls, you are the king of the losing family with your loser fans
they need to put flight on the warriors wit curry
Jesser don’t even look like he trying😂😂
Flight's shot selection looks rushed every time, still has some of his old habits
if i’m being honest the warriors could use flight over nico 😂
he flight had a consistency in his jumpshot then maybe he could beat jesser
Please do a replay on that failed reverse lol
He’s never going to fix his shot smh… no matter how many people help him smh at least he can kinda do a layup and he hustles to get rebounds
Flight has 99 hustle 😂
Flight thinks he is curry change that jump shot
Lmao flight a goat man
This nigga playing hands up defense like he in 2k💀
This might jesser to good flight was capping about them training weeks 😭😭😭😭😭jesser was capping to “im scared” like bruh jesser to good
Flight actually has gotten better but he still needs to hold his follow thru cuz he makes way more when he does
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
ITS JUUUUUUUNE
7:45 wow
June flight is back
bro practice all you want youre never going to get better if you dont get your basketball iq up. Look at the shots youre taking half the time you are just throwing it up off balance praying it goes in or doing dumbass one handed shots. Bro get your base set shoot the damn ball the right way(your right foot should be slightly in front of your left. your left was in front almost every shot), learn moves to create space to get your shot off stop throwing up the bs.
damn flight kinda ass
I know that boy is not wearing a Ben Simmons jersey and is shooting better than Ben Simmons does...
5:54 was just crispy af smh
Bro Flight improved a lot no cap💯
oof
Mans looks like jr Smith

Lot of travels
flight has lowkey gotten better
Flight gotta keep his release, he’s too worried bout chasing the rebound he doesn’t even get a good shot off   (resharing, not my comment but i agree)
Flight needa lay off the ganga and he will go undefeated this year in all 1v1’s

wtf, this video has almost a million views lmao
He has improved
He’s not using his jumper he learned from Ryan lmao he’s just chucking the ball up he’s aggressive at the post though.
Can’t forgot that boy flight smokes 20 times a day😂

Jesser got better
June flight
I know y’all seen that travel from Jesser 4 and a half minutes in
Keep working
roman 10,9 if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord an believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved
jesser wont even tired
fLight is a free W
foucus more on your release and follow through then getting rebounds
flight pls tell us u be trollin bro like u fr so bad at ball  my man lol n ima 5'7 whiteboy id legit trash u bruh. stop jus chuckin shots lol U cant even tell if its gonna go in u run up to the rim every shot bro n ya foot movements is like beginner level still Im jus sayin I thought this man was takin actual nba lessons??
Bro flight is dog shit
Adum
IT'S JUNEEEEE!
Fix yo jumpshot bruh😭
June flight
Is your month ma boy
Flight u really a boot leg 2k17 playshot, like u try so hard to hit a landing animation instead of following through..
Bruh use your foot work in the paint, dont just through it up, that's why jesser blocked u, pump fake and spin around him...
Flight, follow through on your jumper, i know u like curry but even he follows through on most of his shots so stop just quick throwing anf actually add some form to your shot, second off stop fawking shooting, you tall asf use your height, layups before 3s, no reason cash makes more layups than you
Flight’s jumpshot actually looks better
7:46 damn
2:19 nba 2k be like
flight should vs the Professer
First of all, both these niggas defense suck but I will say Flight had great hustle. But what I hate most is when people have game-point and they take unnecessary shots. Just drive on Flight and win already.
0-1 so far flight it’s juneeeeeee we gotta get some W’s this month no more L’s
Man remember how long ago last june was feels like 3 months ago
Aye at least he getting better 🤷🏾
What THE FUCK they talking bout

Flights jumper is so bad he is running to grab his own rebound before he lands. Crazy,
Flight you made some shots yo but you still trash bro 😂😂 aye man FTC!!
Flight with the hustle you game is looking nice
Just gotta stop shooting tired and stop taking bad runners

I feel like flight could get really good at shooting if he followed through with his jumpshot. And he’s taller than most people he 1v1s so that makes it easier
The last time flight played was July bro this is some major progress he just gotta work on his stamina but I love the hustle!!
flights shot is uglier than lonzos shot and his face
Flight on demon time
Jesser coulda been won I could tell he was Trynna let flight score some more🤣🤣
He was in the game against Tyler Herro
Flight come on man remove your past bad habits and apply ur training to the game. We believe in you man. Keep calm and play smart.
Bruh every time you leave your follow through up you make your shot and you need to work on your left hand 80% of the time you dribble you go right.
Who ever is reading this Repent from your sins and get closer to Jesus Christ before it’s too late 📖✝️🙏🏽❤️

Flight definitely got better , if he works on his left  more he’ll get more bucks
flights arm's getting a lil swole or its just me?
You gotta like actually aim and put some power into the ball so u won't air ball and don't just shoot and then run to the rim thats not really doin nothing but messing up your shot lol you throw the ball up and run to the rim no confidence in your shot
jesser is literally a luka😭😭🐌

11-8 isn’t a bad score against sum one like jesser‼️‼️
flight lowkey got better he jus need to not shoot a buzzer beater every time he shoots
It’s funny how he had instant replays on his shots but not jesser’s
One of his flaws is that he is still giving the guy he's guarding space hes not closing in
how y’all saying he look nice ??
June Flight Is Better Than Ever😂
Flight form resembles klay Thompson but shot equals shaq
Flight why shoot so many 3's you are killing yourself like this
Bro, i'm a 5'8 tall 15 year old spanish white guy who plays soccer and i would beat flight 1 on 1

Look at flight trending so inspirational
Flight you been smoking too much man your cardio is awful you played to 7 and you were gassed— and more than half the points were threes!! Lol just playing man
W
These boys got the cardio of cauliflower.
That was hard to watch
Yes finally some basketball
Yessir June Flight
Bro flight is fast asf bro wtf
Jesser is smooth
flight is getting much better he just needs to hold his follow through and jump when Jesser is shooting
Flight has a 99 hustle
You know he sucks when he replays average shots and runs to get his rebounds because he already knows he’s going to miss it.
Flight got good movement and handling but he still got that 1960’s jumper package
Somebody needs to write flight stats in this month and compared it with 2020 June stats, fg% 3pt% defense rating, win and loss % and all that fun stuffs
🙃😎
i thought the intro was just gon be him yellin WHAT THE FUCK and cut off
He got better
How tall Is Jesser?
Are all his fans trolling or what? Lmao this is my first time watching him play he looks terrible 😂
he got way better at finishing he just needs to stop chucking up shots
Flight a better shooter than Ben Simmons ?
flight his shots are pretty much open, u gotta get out there early
Flight is looking better tho
This trending in the UK😮 a day after drop too 🇬🇧FTC Stand tf up🔥
You’re better off challenging mopi

Flight go work on yo jumpshot I'm tired of seeing mf drop you off and break you ankles.its the same shit every year flight. Do better
Flight
Flight did get better I’m surprised
AYYYYYE ITSSSS JUUUUUNE😈
Take ur time but not Dat much time and trust yo shot
I want Ryan razooky to help flight learn the basics. Flight has gotten a lot better but he’s so stiff and he doesn’t hold his follow through
flight dont mind me to say it straight but i think you should work more on your drive,cuz your drive looks weak and i think its not a threat,i love your passion and i do think you have the potential to do it,i hope you can get to the rim more often and dont afraid to use your body,take your time to read the opponent cuz i saw most of the time you just dribble one or two then shoot the ball,make your drive become more powerful cuz its a basic.thats wt i wanna say ,i hope you can get better and better ,luv u.
Flight ain’t a liability on the court no more🤯
sheeeeesh
Flight was literally playing 2k defense wen u put right stick up
Best wish💋💖💓
Flightreacts career high lol

Just needs to step up jesser is a bucket

Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

Check your dms
I’ve been watching flight for 2-3 years and he is still fucking trash
My boy flight lookin cut a Lil
Flight is definitely gonna get more wins this year
0-1 Serious Flight 🤝 (ggs boul you got better)
Sup flight ✌️✌️ 🔥🔥
Even doe flight lost at least he gotten a little better than previous year’s 💯💪🏾

They talking bout that loss
https://youtu.be/FRvBB_F5o3k
Flight def looks in better shape than before
flight mannnnnnn
Bro can we just talk about how better flight had gone.   Respecr
They are breathing like it’s 3OT of a game 7 of the NBA finals wtf
Really Proud Of Flight! U see the improvements! The moves! So inspirational
Why is he so hype for his every point
am i tripping or did flight lowkey gained some weight?
yooo flight is getting better
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
4:30 should be a travel
Perimeter defense is very bad. Keep improving
You lost but the real flight is June 25
Why would I watch this, like there's a chance Flight would win?
Flight has one of the ugliest damn shots I've ever seen
Keep practicing flight💯
notice how Flights month is gay pride month
He needs help from lethal shooter bc that jumper is not it
https://youtu.be/q9ZaosB9mFU ..
https://youtu.be/JPiKA_-enCA
“What the fuck they talking about”😂😂
Trending baby
JUNEEEEE
You looked good out there, Flight, even though you reverted to old Flight sometimes.   Also, if you called walk on Jesser, you would've easily won.   He walked on almost every step back, plus driving to the key.   That's how kids play these days, though. ( a la James Harden) smh
June flight taken more L than W
Bro went 5/21 …
Flight got them smoker lungs lol
It’s juuuuuunneee
its June babyy
#safemoon #safemoonarmy
JUNE FLIGHT YESSIRR

Flight the only youtuber who does instant replays💀😭

You need to play Gio plzzzzzzz😂😂😂
Your step up with the hustle on the court
jesser plays just like luka
I can definitely see flight got better. His jumpshot still kinda iffy but his ball handling, footwork, and defense have improved. Bringing tears to my eyes fr.

This guy can't learn how to hoop..after so many practices. Smh
R2 scammed you
Bro wtf
trust me on this one, when flight fixes the arc on his jumpshots, he’ll be making alot more shots
Come June flight ☔
ITS JUUUUNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEE😈🔥🔥🔥
What shoes is Flight wearing ?
now y in the f*** would he play jesser first game bck 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Adin vs flight
Is it an American audience?🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️
Bro Jesse was injured and he still played a good game so, good job Jesse! Both of you played good my guys.
If flight masters his shot and uses his size to his advantage... 😶
Flight gotta keep his release, he’s too worried bout chasing the rebound he doesn’t even get a good shot off     Edit: Flight did get way better tho 🐐
Flight stop taking so many threes drive you're good at driving when you shoot threes and miss you run to the ball and that is why you're so out of breathe so early
i need that flight after 3 point  badge 😭
Flight I gotta admit you got better. But you need to work on executing your moves and shot so they are consistent
I wanna 1v1 him so bad
Jesser is ugly asf with no facial hair
June flight on toppppp
I knew this was gonn go trending bro like I speak thing into existence
Lmao still weak af 🤦🏻‍♂️
“I feel like its better without the trainer because I can practice on my own free will and motivation” which translates to, “I only practice when I feel like it”
Flight every time he shoots🏃🏾‍♂️
whys he playin like there is 3 seconds on the shot clock
If flight makes a shot he celebrates like he just found a cure for cancer 😭
You can tell Jesse wasn’t really trying that hard but flight is lowkey getting nicer and nicer
Why does flight still do the same moves?they aren’t that good, I though he would’ve changed it up some by now
Halftime? They must be in the burbs. Dan Majerle's youngest has range like his pops. Flight is Serena Williams booty. I've seen superior skills at my local YMCA 6 foot & under wheelchair basketball league.
Flight looks like he’s just having so much fun. Makes me happy, makes me smile
wwwww vid
Why would you post this
bro you have got to stop shooting the three, you're a tall dude, just run and do lay-ups
Y’all getting excited over Logan paul fight I’m more hyped about this
Flight quit playing basketball you ass dawg
Yo shot lookin nice
Flight is different
you got better for sure 💯 you just gotta be more confident. stop chucking up the ball and running to get the rebound have confidence that you gonna make the shot.
Flight u disappointed me
Flight really just did an instant replay on a two hand 3-point shot😂😂 My 8 year-old cousin has better form than this grown man😂😂 You know ur down bad when u get blocked by Jesser👀👀
LOOK AT DAME DOLLAS SON
Flight out here with that ugleh ahhh jumper 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Taking L’s already flight🤦🏼‍♂️
7:44
Bro how tall is jesser now?😂 he looks much taller than flight and flight like 6’3 lmao
Why does flights jump shot look like an ally every time
3:40 look at steph curry’s son man
Nah you have good moves tbh u just need to work on your shooting technique from zero you need to completely change that
Lmaoo flight is str888 Ass 😭 man doesn’t improve at all
What a nice guy. Wonder if he like tj warren?
Flight is the only player I know who shoots to miss 😂
Its Juuune
JUNE FLIGHT ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️

June flight😈
damn flight why can't u win those games if only I could train u the way I trained myself I am a 5'5 that plays like a 6'7 I never been to a club tho, cz u got potential u got the hustle and the height why can't u give the fans what they need. u got skills man but u don't know how to use them u need someone to push u to work hard not play with u i am not no coach but i promise u i can make u better dm me if u intreseted cz i rlly wanna see u dominate @sleiman_boudiab on insta
Flight moved up a rep dumpster to trash next is garbage then recycling Ben then normal basketball player🤧
Bro flights is actually getting pretty good I think that he takes to much shots but hood game bro
That was a good game
Flight vs a kid again pls
he fast asf he’s like 6’2 -6’3 if he would learn how to shot he would be a good player
ITS JUNNNEEEEEEE
The improvement from flight is crazy
Flight is a 77 ovr playmakin shot
JUNE FLIGHT
1v1 the professor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do I wanna see him Vs Gio Wise so bad 😂
This man takes the dumbest shots
Let me guess haven’t watched yet but he lost 😂
FLIGHT  IS DIFFEREEENT
flights shooting was actually good, his drives are just too weak. he could be rlly good if he worked on it.  flight to the NBA ✈️
Walking L
Bruhhh those instant replays are killing me 💀💀💀💀💀lmaooooo
Bro the camera angle is tuff I low key thought this was a video game 🔥🔥🔥
So much for flight saying he’s going 50-0
Aye flight got better mann ‼️
WTF FIRST CLIP HE SHOT LIKE A BOT
Flight do you even look at the rim when you pull up?
June flight so far is a disappointment I hope it don't stay like that
Flight you shot 5 of 22 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Highkey if Flight follows through his shot and doesn’t lag with it like how Cash used to, his shot would be way better tbh but GG Flight
i like this version of flight
4:00 .....
June flight baby 😈
imagine flight 1v1 curry
"Time to pay sum bills"
Look at flight man
Flight got swatted and air balled 5 layups no more talkin shit
I think flight would cook adinross
Flight flicking the wrist on his shots now with a crazy ass step back ilike it! ITS JUUUNNEEEE!!
June Flight is GODLY
Jesser; such a good guy. Humble and let him get back into it after being up 10-2
I feel like if flight took his time when playing and takes advantage of his in the paint he would be a better player
He’s literally gotten ten times better
I’ve been waiting
flight couldve beat him if he didnt force up shots
Someone said that Adin weighs 150 and Flight is 170 lol idc if flight has been putting on weight he looks like 145 in this vid and adin looks like 125
flight improved
“ it’s not about losing or winning it’s about being better than you were yesterday”
Jesser has the fade away from a center builld😂
Flight is rushing and forcing shots up to quickly
Flight is so ass bro

Jesser reminds me of luka

Flight no disrespect because you one of my favorite YouTubers but you know how you be like I can make that shot in my sleep you air balled with your eyes open soooooo what does that mean.😂😂

Flight is a grade A rebounder every time he shots he straight go for the rebound no matter what
Why does flights arms look beefier

JUNNE
Flight breathing hard as shit
He needs to stop curving his drive and drive into the body cuz it’s forcing him to take fadeaway and hooks. He needs to train on taking contact on layups too
@awgesage
L lungs
Bro Jesser is such a nice dude
June flight is a fraud
Flight has to guard up believe me bro guard more up don't only put your hand out guard up
Thank God the cameras were on for this one
Someone get this man some new lungs 💀
Camera man smooth
Its that time of year again Flight
While in June form flight should play mmg

flight literally speaks of other nba player that they dont have any form while shooting check his pose 😂
Can't lie flight improved alot

Jesser blocked flight 2 times in one game in June he must be evicirated

Anyone remember LostNUnbound? 🤔

Press up more on defense
5:42 Trae Young without the talent 😪
this comment has 1 like.
like seeing flight improve. he just needa take his time with his shots. i can see June being way better than last years june. Keep up the good work flight. only question is, why didn't flight have a halftime when he hit 8 points?
Intro gods
June is flight month 🔥🔥
Flight back with the replays if you know you know

You are habe so bad shout
LHype
June flight
Why does everyone treat flight like a make a wish kid he clearly got worse and it’s clear he’ll never improve
bro flights shots so weird doe
5m on the way shit crazy bro keep doing yo thang 💪🏻🔥
Getting better but I hate that lil fast floater 😂😂
Goat
so inspirational mannnn
Fraudreacts
Flight you gotta step it up man. Jesser sucks at basketball, and idk if he can help that. You on the other hand can be great as Steph Curry himself.
ive missed flight 1v1s man
I feel like jesser was playing with flight
To be honest, Flight has good fundamentals but it is his skills and pace that is making him worse. If he can learn some skills and also learn how to not rush and control the pace, he will get better in my opinion
flight got bigger tho lowkey
If u look closely enough flights 3's goes in when his feet r wide open🙂
Cmon flight where’s the damn score
L
6:36 bro wasn’t even confident in his own shot 😭😭
Mad nostalgia when flight said that it’s june
Fuck is flights form🤣🤣
Good to see the instant replays back 😂😂
7:43 no one finna talk about jesser tossin Flight’s shit damn near over the wall 😂 5:53 Jesser got that harden step back in slowmo ahaha 🙈

Flights looking like Damien lilard out there 👀👀👀
Adin vs Flight plssss we need it
Flight making going crazy i like it

God damn flights improving
Stop squaring up when you shoot
Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour
Flight playing like kuzma
Flights shot is so ugly though
LHype
If you picked a guy off the street that has never played in his life, hed still have a better shooting action then flight lol that hook shot
🐐
Its sid the sloth
yo flight look at the rim when you shoot
flight is back in june
“It’s juuunnnee” 👀
Flight has really improved a lot. You can tell just look at his jump shot man 🥵🥵
he’s looking better this june
June flight only loses by 3 in the first game and it was against Jesse. A lot of improvement from flight from last year already.
Wow he scored 8 points. I thought Jesser was gonna destroy but wow. I think flight improved.
Flight is like Dennis Rodman
Getting better
Bro flight is good and has potential he just has to work on his shooting form
If this was 2k then he has only bought vs and spend it on his attributes, but his play style has not changed at all
Flights d gotta improve
my gee i haven’t seen a single three and it’s game point
So shit 🤦🏾‍♂️😭😭
bru his jumpshot 💀
Anybody realize flight been looking a lil bigger
It’s JUNE
He’s getting better now bruh
Bro gets upset when jesser scores, but aint playin no defense😕
Flight bro I can’t keep defending you 💀
Flight getting better
Who else is waiting for cash to react and pay his bills lol 😭😂
Bro flight take yo time and try and get to the basket
Flight June 2021 Record: 0-1
Word to my motha FLIGHT IS A LEGEND N BELONGS IN THA HALL OF FAME FOR EVERTING 📈💯💯
Man don’t listen to these haters in the comments Flight, LETS GO JUNE FLIGHT!!! Step on these fools 💪🏾
If flight shoots less and works on just making open threes then he’d be fine, he should really focus on improving his layups and inside game which seems to be his strength, especially rebounding is pretty good
FLight needs to start taking his time and attacking the rim instead of chucking up shots. He’s def better tho
Jesse tru the years is getting slower and slower hes not that athletic anymore
Flight arms got bigger
still got that weak ass jump shot contester 🤦🏽‍♂️
Flight slow down when your on offense you have time. You could’ve actually won if you did. But your looking a lot better now
Flight Stat Averages: Record (0-1) Points: 8.0 Rebounds: 12.0 Blocks: 1.0 Steals: 0.0 Field Goal Percentage: 28% 3 Point Percentage: 30% - Opponent Stat Averages: Record (1-0) Points: 11.0 Rebounds: 8.0 Blocks: 1.0 Steals: 0.0 Field Goal Percentage: 53% 3 Point Percentage: 50%

#JuneFlight🐐🔥  Look At Steph Curry son men so inspirational

June Flight mode would’ve been good for the warriors
Im not actually mad at flight for losing he  really got good that step back was fire🤌💥
I’m surprised flight didn’t tell Jesser that Ben Simmons is a casual since he is wearing a jersey
flight is trash bruh 🤣
Flight best hooper ⁉️
His dribbling do look better
imagine flight going to the nba, theres celebrity boxing but now imagine youtubers actually in nba
Do a 1v1 match against polo g
Immediately I saw flight’s shot has improved and his basketball IQ has gone up some. ITS JUNEEEEEEEEEEE
I can drop off flight myself he's an embarrassment to basketball ball he's always too eager to shoot and he has no  control in his shot like cmon flight JUST STOP...you really think you're nice but you're really booty And don't think you will ever drop me bcuz you will not and I can bet BIG MONEY ON IT
my boy definitely hustling out there
Flight use that camera bra the other camera you use looks like you record with a android

Every time flight shoot he run for board cuz he cant shoot
2:22 Thank God he had the cameras on this time....... Or no one would believe
If flight can fix up his shot and defense he might actually win
What is that jumper
Yo flight. Lakers need some shooters, you might be expecting a call soon shooting like that
When u click so fast just  for him to go down bad like 83 points before halftime 🤦🏻
Your in better shape but your still up to flight type of basketball
Flight definitely improved his whole game got you just gotta improve those layups and finish them
Flight had atleast 20 rebounds that game😂
juneeeew
"That's my typa shot"😭😂😂
If I got to spend 1 month of training with Flight he would destroy every single YouTuber in 1v1 he would be a beast :) every day for a month I would turn him in a machine :)
Need to get better in driving the ball🤷‍♂️
jesser step back and jumper is smooth asl
Y’all realize the fact that everyone goes try hard when it’s June flight just trynna show off 🤡🤡
Lol and you start off with an L hahaha bum
Yo if anyone of y’all still think flight is good u is a d rider to da max on god
Yessssirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Flight go block like that shit tuff
flights hustle is crazy but you have to hold your form
flightt has horable form
Still a W in my opinion
Nobody gonna tell me flight hasn't gotten more mature.... cuz normally he would just throw a tantrum when losing
Flight instantly sprinting for his rebound after a shot is always the funniest thing 🤣
ITS JUUUUUUNE
June flight letss go
https://youtube.com/shorts/8LT6XFQPsQo?feature=share

Flight is a type of guy that work hard and still loss like bro improve your shooting and layup pacage
If I was flight I would get lethal shooter as a trainer because him training by himself obviously isn't working
Flight's hustle is out of this world🔥
Ngl.. Flight really improved this June💯💯💯
My god, flight been trash talking saying he can drop off NBA players and manz can't even beat Jesser
just got to fix that release on the jump shot and you will be mad chillin.
Flight you need to stop rushing your shot the more time you take it gives your body more rest   And gives you more time to think about your next shot also when you shoot make sure your guid Arm is straight and not diagonal makes your shot more straight and not go to the left

Flight u the bro 🤟🏾 but basketball is not for u 🤦🏽‍♂️
Flight is improving his mechanics and stamina by a mile if you ask me, but he is just not taking his time with the ball. He is just chucking up threes. If he could try and shot create and look for mid range shots and shots under the rim and occasional step back threes he could easily win a lot of games
this was a L buhh he is looking better
NGL... Flight really ain’t lookin bad. Imagine mid June Flight 👀
He's back!
Flight built like Ja Morant
yo thatss fireee
4:30 was that legal??
flight really shot 3/17 from three
If y’all say flight ass y’all just haters, this man has actually improved

stop shotting threes i will bet you flight and i’m 13
Flight come to new york and play me  so you can get smoked
ITS JUNEEEEEEEEEE
hes pretty good i just say he needs to work on his footwork, three point shot, contested layups, midrange shot, energy, post moves, shot contesting, ball handling, dribble moves, and shot selection
The other dude looks like he’s tryna throw the game, shit I’d do the same i wonder how much flight is paying this guy to play bad
Why tf Jesser always so awkward in vids
If follow yo shot was a person
Keep improving flight!
June Flight 90 overall
June flight
Love flight but he thinks he can beat nba players 😂 but he loses to Jesser
7:44
Petition for flight to dunk
Kessler could have been ended it but was trying to shoot crazy shoots
The FTC go was working like a charm tonight 😭

Flights stats Decision making: 2/10 (shot too many 3’s) Driving/post play: 4/10 (good spin move) Defense: 6/10 (needs to guard up top more) Hustle: 10/10 Endurance: 1/10

Flight went from shooting like a 7/11 bigman to shooting like a McDonalds Curry. Wheres the follow-thru lol
flight got lucky when he was shooting and he got all tht training but wont do it on the court  but at least flight almost one if he stop rushing his shots
@YourRAGE Gaming needs to react to this😂😂😂

The intro is 🔥
Jesser out here looking like Luka 😂😂😂
flight getting better just gotta work on defense
It’s funny because Jesser literally toying wit flight
Flight be looking like tht he played right but the shot hasn’t gone in yet
Flight got new dribble packages. He’s actually looking good now!
Lmfao yall are getting played. He takes breaks, has yall hyped about him getting better in the process, and then comes out looking the same....but.....he gains more views because people want to see if he got better and to make jokes. It is genius on his part though for marketing 😂
Flight I have hella respect for u but u gotta give replays to everybody cuz

my boy flight looking tuff now, but flight when you shoot follow through and when it’s your possession slow it down, don’t just shoot it, it’s your offense do whatever you want. Just don’t allow the defender to make your offense.
Flight slow tf down
Flight actually got better. Just needs to start hitting open shots and get in better shape
FLIGHT HUSTLE

When flight was shooting it wasn’t as bad as before but i think that he just needs to put a little bit more strength on some of his shoots he shot

I think Flight will beat Jesser in 2022
I'm a flight fan but the he shooting the ball like he tryna shoot a Stephen curry floater
Flight is the definition of "All bark, no bite"
never met a black dude as trash as flight needs to work on his jumper and hold follow through
JUNE ALERT
It’s a bit annoying see all that comments by flight fans saying that he’s getting good!! Stoppp, he is not getting good! He don’t shoot, he throw the ball and hopes that the ball go in! No hate fr but he is one of the worst people that I’ve watched play basketball! He’s awful
That pump fake tho
He airball most he layups and say he don't then before flight u trash
U look better man keep it up

Irish Spring GREEN GREEN

It’s JUNNNEEEE
Flight tried to cheat the score at 3:46
good game, Flight had some improvements considering the last matches
flight!!! lookin good my boy
0-1 fo Flight but he played better
Flight getting bigger cuz
jesser plays like luka doncic no capp
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Flight on defense not all contact is a foul put a body on him
jesser travels every other possession lmao
Would be better if you stop throwing up shots and just take your time
Flight never talk down on lebron again
Flight does a causal move…     Goes crazy turns into a damn demon💀
Ok ok 😌
Flight only loss because it’s there court because they practice every day on that court
Valid improvement flight
At 7:45 flight got his shot swatted
7:43 trust me bro
Oh shiittttttt
ITS JUNEEEE!!!
8:07 when flight he a step back IRISH SPRING GREEN GREEN
we waited a year for this
Bro flight what that jump shot tho lol
Flights defense is so bad.. its ok to miss those shots if his defense was good
Yo yo yo
And your beating KD 1 vs 1 ? 🤣🤣🤣
Bro can’t lie, flight is fast 😂😂
ITS JUUUNNNEEEE
0-1,ima keep the track of his record
Stamina has increased‼️💪🏾. He definitely is trying harder.

Jesser has rona
He lost?? How tf this man looking good😂😭
Looking like he got stronger
Jesser got rona
Flight with the signature instant replay
Not the step back
It was a good game I deff like the way flight hustled and had some nice threes. He has to work on finishing at the basket a bit more. That step back tho 👀
Ok flight I see you cookin go 5 for 20 aka curry would never 😂
all flight need to do is get some arch on that shot n he’s straight
JUNE FLIGHT
Flight looking Swole out here 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Flight looking good
June flight back all y’all YouTubers get ready bc  he coming
Jesser has to delay that gather a bit in order for it to count as the 0 step, otherwise it’s a carry all day and a pretty cut and dry call.
Cashnasty vs Flight soon 😈🤝
We gotta respect flights hustle mann
if flight took more time on his possessions and hit some of the bricks, he'd acc be hella tough
Flight Game 1 Stats:  8 PTS || 12 REBS || 3/11 3-PT || 5/21 FG ||  27% 3-PT 23% FG  Jesser’s stats  11 PTS || 9 REBS || 3/7 3-PT || 8/18 FG || 2 BLKS 42% 3-PT 44% FG  Ive replayed this vid like 3 times to re check if i got anything wrong and this is what i got.
Flight looking nice
Jumpshot still broken
people sleepin on jesser he lowkey nice with it
Flight man, you gotta get more comfortable coming into the paint and pressing against the defender. You get too tentative and shoot bad shots. Jesser was coming into the paint more and got a lot of easy buckets, which is something you can do too. You're a tall dude. Use your height in the paint!
flight tuffff
June x flight = GOD
Yessir flight gg
Okay flight
Juuuuune
That white boy could shoot crispy form
At least you scored
flight just needs iq
still ass
Yessir
I love flight and all and yes he has gotten better but honestly this 1v1 was trash
Damn that trainer been doing serious work. Flight is soooo much better
And to comment again jesser could’ve been won lol💀 he was playing with flight.
Flight shot looking nice
Here before cash nasty reacts
Good shit FLIGHT!!!
JUNE
Flights handles got better no cap
Look at flight man so inspirational
Flight out on muscle ok I see u
2:20 GOD DAMN, IS THIS REALLY FLIGHT? P. S. Flight got better fr. Of course Jesser didn't play at full strength, but Flight is looking not so bad. He became better at fundamentals, better shot, handles, he also looks more athletic . But defence is very bad, if Jesser wanted, he could score every possession. Flight stays 1 or 2m far from Jesser, also bad defense in the paint. Gotta improve defense. However that was nice, and he became really better
FLIGHT STOP SMOKING
1v1 gio wise!!
🔥🔥
No need to fear June flight gonna carry this year
My boi flight looking nice
FLIGHT'S MONTTH!!! IT'S JUNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT'S JUNEEEEEEEEE
Boi get your finishing badges up
6:20 LMAO He thinks he's Kyrie

Nobody:  Rage: Omg Flight.... 😳

He still shooting like that and try to get his own rebound he getting tired when he does the BS
“Time to pay some bills”
Your looking great flight but try to hold your form more it will make your jump shot a hella lot more consistent
Flight needs to learn how to take people off the dribble and play in the post. He just jacks up threes. Jesse wasn’t even trying he was shooting from half court.
Flight month

Nipples out flight can’t be stopped
Ngl, that fake was nasty

Yo if flight stopped just throwing up shots and took his time aiming… he would actually be tuff
Flightreacts 1v1 returns
He’s improvements are clear, but he needs to improve that off dribble shot, it’s setting him back. He needs to look at the rim before shooting.

Even though he lost, I loved the way flight played today it was like he’s hustling in every moment of the game
I’m not gon lie flight. No hater shit. You can tell you’ve been putting up shots because the range is there I just feel if you work on correcting your form you’d make way more shots. But I do see improvement. Not that my opinion matters just an observation bro. Keep it up
8:15 menace to society
Haha Flight💯

First game in 11months
11-8 against jesser!!! Ay not bad
It’s juuuuunne
June flight is back!
first bucket was tuff😂
Flight huffin and puffin 4 minutes into the game😂
Menace to anything reacts 8:16
Flight best defender in the YouTube Comunity
I wish flight could just chill on the quick 3 pointers. If he did that he’ll do way better in June 2021 than last year. Seeing improvement slowly but surely in my opinion.
WTF THEY TALKING BOUT !!! 😈🔥
FLUGHT MAKING A COMEBACK
Keep it up Flight, you are looking better
You can tell flight had fun playing this game
good game
Flight lowkey got better, obviously jesser wasn’t going 100% or else it would’ve been a blow out. But flights moves got a hell of a lot smoother 💯. I see big W’s from flight coming this June😈💯

Jesse got the honor of first matchup vs June flight🙌🏽👑
Same flight🤦🏽‍♂️😢
Flight said ugly jumpshot video
Flight has to fix his jumpshot bro
flight needs to learn to keep composure after scoring a decent bucket,he tends to take unneeded shots after making a bucket,when he’s calm and collective he takes good shots makes good moves//only if he learns how to keep composure ,and learn how to follow thru when making good moves
Poor flight
The intro has me crying😭!!!
Flight still ass😂😂

When u realize flight has a 97 offensive rebounds
Ok FLIGHT lemme find out

If flight stops shooting and only drives he might win.. against a 6th grader
Next up he is facing Frank Michael Smith which i have never seen play but that will be a game

https://youtu.be/_p0mkJgQ_Ss
Damn, never knew Simmons could shoot...
Who else waiting for cash nasty reaction
That move from flight at 2:17!!!?
Flight without the weed is a 99ovr but smoking weed is a 50ovr ig flight only smoked weed once a week he will probably be a bttr player and have more stamina
Dont worry flight the court was slightly off
Flight looks good no cap
Flight looking nice...
Tbh Flight hasn't improved thats much that's my opinion he keeps on taking dumb shot's has no defense and keep's on shooting 3s he's not consistent at all.
ACCEPT JESUS as you LORD AND SAVIOR to get to HEAVEN and have a RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD to get to HEAVEN JOHN 3:16 says for GOD so LOVED the world that he gave his ONLY BELOVED SON whoever BELIEVES in HIM SHALL NOT perish but have EVERLASTING LIFE JESUS IS KING
The instant replays😭😭😭
This nigga still plays the same
if he would’ve made that shot😨7:23
Bronny vs flight
Flight you gotta hire lethal shooter at this point.
I don't know about that form
If flight really wants to hit his shots, he gotta always hold his follow through and square the basketball hoop, it is literally a beginners skill, you have flight doing the same thing since last year.
W Camara man
Flights not half bad easy bounce back💯
Ngl flight lookin shreaded
The 2hype house is just overall so clean
Here before Cash reacts to this
ITS JUNEEE
Adin vs Flight next 😈
He has improved but he puts way to much energy into his layups and rushes way to many shots but happy to see him improve.
Flight guards like 2k
If flight worked on his shot choices he would actually be good
Flight look big still skinny but he been eating
I like jesser step back I’m stealing that
When Flight Makes an Edit..  All of us: “it’s about time” 😂😭

W
his step back is a travel
We all know flight wasn’t going to win but he def got better
NO ADS WTF 😶👀
Bruh I’m disappointed in flight he regressed back to before last June where he was chasing his rebound before the shots even went up😂😭
GG Flight for a second I was gona be disappointed but u made a come back nice can’t wait to see who u play next keep up the hard work.
Mans warmup in June was prolly the hardest member to 1v1 in 2hype, definitely has improved since the last time!
He got crossed by flight
Obviously rigged, Jesser had magnets on the hoop. Smh
Holy shit I can't believe how close that was
And the open gate jump shot has returned.
He lost, but he actually played well. Good for you, Flight.
He’s like the Dennis Rodman of YouTube! He can’t make shots, but he gets hella rebounds lmao. Why does he shoot with two hands?
Nice Vid, but can you include a scoreboard next time?
I see his game got better but I think his sportsman ship improved as well
Respect to flight for playing Jesser Cuz Jesser us Nice bro. I just wished flight would had picked easier Opponent for the first game.
Flight actually did it with the cameras on
We need that duke dennis rematch number 2 this one for all the marbles DEEBLOCK vs FTC
Stop playing like your scared n your good flight
Oh yeah this flight different
It’s June flight with the 1v1’s love it.
First L
We can’t lie flight didn’t play thattttt bad 😂
✈✈✈✈
6:29 I thought Jesser was bout to do flight dirty
same old flight but that's alright still entertaining and funny
Seeing flight in person again is so wholesome
Did flight bulk up a little or am I trippin
cash is gonna love this
Flight have more lungs moving better got buffer you bout to make me act up
26.1% from the field. Keep it up flight, that’s an improvement
Woahhhhhhhh first bucket spin pivot
his shot looks better
Flight getting tired fast bc your ass smoking every day
8:14 HOF School Threat
i promise if flight stop worrying bout the rebound right after he shoot and actually hold his follow through bro would hit more
It’s juuuuuuneeee
Gotten much better. Just not enough legs
ADIN VS FLIGHT ASAP
ITSS JUNNEEE
first 5 seconds and Flight already a school threat
They have zero stamina 😂
IT'S JUNE
Flight got more stamina He needs a follow through in his shot
its junnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee in this bitch !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! like if you want go luck for life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Flight built muscle
Jesservskyle anderson 😂😂SLOWEST GAME IN HISTORY
Flight put up a fight I can actually say
Flight is so trash 😆 jesser had way more fundamental skills
Bro flight you playing like you got a shot clock slow down and stop rushing your shot.
Thought he was playing Luka for a minute
Me: flight for sure got better   5:42 Me: fuck...
Flight moving fast asl😂
Flights gas tank increased by like 70%
1. Ball Handling. amd movement Perfect A 2. Shooting: Uhhhh...nigga u need more palractice go to uour trainer with that more 3. Scoring: ILIKE THIS, KEEP GOING MAN DO YOUR SHIT MAN 4. Making it to the rim: C+ keep working on those. Moral of the story: Ball handling is on fire. Do more  better on your shooting. Do more pump fakes around the rim. And i hope Cash puts respect on this video
WORK ON YOUR DEFENSE FLIGHT YOUR A DEMI GOD 89 REBOUNDING 96 SPEED 94 DRIBBLING 86 3PT AND THE REST ARE 60s
June!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Look at flight man....soo inspirational
Jesser traveled before he scored to get eight he switched his pivot foot
Who else waiting for Cashnasty and Yourrage to react to this...
Funny how Jesser has Ben Simmons shirt, but he’s like the 2nd best shooter in 2hype, 1st is LSK btw
It's JUUUUUUNE
Had to click fast

Wlight😎

2:23 INSTANT REPLAY IS BACK!! 🤣
i wanna see him play lil babyyyyy .
That boy Flight was Soo happy to post this he forgot the scoreboard
Since we had high exceptions for last June, I kept mine low this time and I was right. Flight you are one of my favorite youtubers but you are straight ass at hooping. I've seen the progress in your training clips, but you completely discard and go back to your old play style. STOP SHOOTING AT THE 3 POINTER LINE EVERY TIME
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gg flight
Fight talk all that trash about nba players but when he get out there he doesn't look like he knows how to play
June flight back
Flights getting better wtf 😳
Flights stamina went from a 65 overall to a 92 😳
“Instant replay” never gets old 😂😂
flight be run-in like a 3.0 no cap
Every bone in my body wanted flight to win for his comeback to 1v1 videos😂🤣
June IS HERE!!!!!!!!!
ITS JUNEEE
Flight looks low key jacked
Jesser is just the nicest guy man
The one thing flight does is he doesn’t pace his game and doesn’t play his game he just rushes and tries to get a bucket he needs to pace and play him
Flight, when you shoot. Hold the follow through
Cash finna pay some bills😂

He got better
Idk if it’s just me or is flight gaining more muscle?
Flight looking big wtf

Speaking seriously though, Flight has made major improvements in his game! His mystique is built on sarcasm, so as he gets better and better ironically it will be worse for his character because it won't be funny watching him suck anymore because he won't suck lol!
Even though it’s a L , big improvement my dawg , keep grinding you going be where you wanna be soon !!!!
He just warming up trust me on that 💯
Flight was so happy 😭

Even though he lost he really got better no 🧢‼️
Look at flight man
Yea Jesser definitely has Luka Doncic playing style
6:14 ppl don’t know how disrespectful that is, when your down in a 1v1 and the person tries to get a sick shot for a game winner, I don’t like hoopers like that honestly, pretty cocky thing to do.
flight is a disgrace to basketball
W vid
JJJUUUNNNEEEEE FFFLLLIIIIGGGHHHHTTT HHHHEEEERRRREEEE
Irish ☘️ spring green green💵
FlightReacts stats: PTs: 8  Rebounds: 10  FG%: 5 for 20, 25% Airballs: 3 Turnovers 0 Steals: 0 2 PT%: 3 for 11, 27%  If u have any knowledge about 1v1 basketball, that wasn’t a good performance by June Flight
Flight got much better! Gg!

Goat
June flight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LITERALLY all he has to do to make shots is hold his form LITERALLY. The times he made the shtick he held his form. Dude was 5-19 that's horrible he just needs to make that 8-19 then he wins that game
My type of vid. It’s juneeeeeee
We gon see cash reaction like in 5 min 😂
Flight why dont you start in the mid range first then work out towards the 3 and  instead of having a wide shooting base put ur feet together
Hope flight wins lesser LHYPE
Flight get ur coach back 😂😂😂
So we not gon talk about it? 4:29
why do i hear the "YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" already?😂😂
Flight has one of the best jumpers in all of youtube
junnnnnnnne
I see a little improvement but he just needs to work on his shot and his stamina more
1:39 As soon as I saw the classic flight defensive position I was worried about the result 💀😭
Advice for Flight: don't rush your shot. I've noticed that you're kind of rushing yourself into shots that are contested or have no form at all. Let the game come to you gradually and don't rush yourself too much.
imagine getting crossed up by jesser i mean look at this dudes player build ahahahahahahah (flight laugh)
yesssir
he plays better than last June
We all been wating for this
honestly tho flight's gotten better
Flight hustling the whole game making smokers proud

:54  big 🧢🧢
STAMINA REACTS
“Time to pay some bills”
Cash gonna love this! But tbh other than the ugly jumper you do look better Flight LOL
Jesser is really jumpy and wants the blocks, so if he would have faked him out on the last play it would have been different. But flight you got better and we missed seeing you on the court
It’s just the beginning Flight will be back Nd better than ever !!!!!!
flight you worked out?
Flights not high
Get some Gatorade for your stamina and you would be vetter
Flight in JUNNEEEE
Wtf I ain't even mad with this result I mean Jesse plays well
Im 99,9% sure that I could beat flight at a game of 1v1
Demigod vs flight rematch????

Tbh if flight would’ve called those travels he would’ve won 🤷‍♂️
YOOO FLIGHT IN HIS BAG IN JUNEEEEE

Flight work on your stamina if you worked on your stamina you could’ve beat Jesse because you would’ve had the hustle you had at the start of the game
FLIGHT lookin better the only thing I would say to work on is release, if he doesn’t work I think that will be better hella entertaining I’m excited for this June Flight

Nice to see flight back on the court lol
I think he should rematch Jesser at the end of June. I think he can take him
who's ready for cash to react?🤣
Bro its just like Flights videos we cant see the score!
Horrible defense 😂  Flight does 🙌 2-3 feet away or slowly and softly closes out.. intimidator non existent
It’s Juneeeeeeeeeee
Follow thru on your shot flight dont worry bout the rebound
Flight needs to do the moves he’s been working on bruh
he’s gotten better i think but he’s still trash af
One of the best games flight played alot of improvement and patience
even though flight lost, hes actually looking way better, keep up the grind man
Rage gonna have fun with this one
Cash is typing........
Lucky shots for flight he trash!
Flight went crazy!
It’s June!!!!!!!!
As soon as Flight puts a shot up he gets to running to that rim like the camera man on Maury I stg
Every shot Flight takes looks like the last second shot release on 2k.
Finally fight got a new camera 😂
that form looking beautiful
How tf u lose to jesser
WHAT THE FUCK THEY TALKING BOUT !
Cash finna be dying of laughter when he react to this
Flight  running out of breathe the whole game
flight back to the running no look hook shots 😂😂😂😂
Definitely did better than last time great improvement
NEVER CLICKED SO FAST
Flight just might be on his shit ready for cash to react to this I LIKES THIS
I wish Flights actually gets a trainer and trains for like 2 months straight... he got the quickness for sure
So close he needs to drive
flights speed and shot have gotten better even though he lost
flight is good but after he hit a three he just takes any type of shot after u make a three fight u need to stay calm and take smart shots be i see u getting better
flight gotta stop smokin this nigga runnin on 2k low stamina at the start of the game LMAO
Flight you need to slow down on  some of your moves and I guarantee they will go in💯
Jesser always been nice but flight you’re improving take smarter shots and MAKE them all in all great game
Bro that defense😂

Can’t wait to see cash react to this. Dude gonna be crying of laughter
Flight still suck but he is improving, all he has to do is extend his shooting arm when he shoot , and he also had to go to the goal a lot more than he shoot, oh yea and he has to follow through on his shot when he shoot he runs to the goal for some reason
*Clears throat* “TIME TO PAY SOME BILLS”
I think rage fasho gon be impressed
Flight done got a lil better💯.. if he trained more consistently then he would be a lot better
0:04 4 seconds in and The Demon already Unleashed😈
good game
Looks way better than last year
Jesser was just playing w his food tbh
Yessuh
Dude got dropped off😂🤣
His shooting form is soo weird and he takes a shit ton of 3s.. if he actually wants to improve, he needs to mix it up and not just take 3s
0-1
Flight 23% From the Field
Yo that’s a W to me
it’s JUNE 😈
Flight rushed it. If he would’ve taken his time he would’ve won
Flight actually got a little better he can probably beat cash 🤷🏾

LETS GOO ITS BACKKK NOW WE NEED ADIN VS FLIGHT
Who else cant wait till cash reaction 🤣🤣😂
If flight actually followed through and didn’t chase the ball he would be a so much better shooting , his defence has improved big time 💯keep up the grind flight and making these videos 🔥
Juneeee flightttt
Adin vs Flight NEXT???
Yo flight you doing the same thing stop that hop fade and shoot do the same thing in the paint push him of you so u have space to make a easy layup that’s how cheese always got the left side on you because he pushed of and got an easy lay up and if you do it u have advantage cuz u tall trust. Even if you think they bigger cuz you can tell you were driving in the paint in this vid and you can see that you backs of because he was there push him of you
Keep getting inside
Time for YourRage and Cash Nasty hilarious reactions
Shiiii it’s fucking Junnneeeee
I was the first to like the video
