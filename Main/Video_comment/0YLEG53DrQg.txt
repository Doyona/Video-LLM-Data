Chris Eubank sr if he let's go is possibly the best Suphusicated trash talker of all time he just has class so doesn't crosses the line
Eubank is a warrior, Jordan is a journalist, White's a ponce. Simple really.
Snr is jokes! Completely lost his mind

It happened and you were there. What a load of garbish he was talking
Wicked, Wicked, Journalist Massive
Rastafari Reach dreadlocks 😂😂😂😂😂 you gotta love Chris
Simon was absolutely rattled here what a watch 🤣🤣
Aged Beautifully! What was Chris talkin about? Credibility…Ahhhh 😂 yeah he has that for sure!
What’s wrong with this journalist dude?
You’re a journalist and that’s all she wrote
He’s a jourrrrrrnalist
Here after fight happened
Love Chris for not rising to Simons straight up attitude. That gets you slapped in real life
"Dont point at me christ, thats rude"  Bruh you dont want that, stfu 🤣🤣🤣
Simon taking the glasses off is a square go
A journalist is a person who gathers information in the form of text, audio or pictures, processes it into a newsworthy form and disseminates it to the public. This is called journalism.
The balls to say "I don't need you" as I watch several videos with his name in the title 🤣
Don’t be so bloody silly.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simon usually wrong but the money 💸 will  😢😂🎉🎉 talk
:025 ..."in the schhtudio".  Jim's pished.
He was being kind. He’s a failed businessman that was forced to become a journalist.
Imagine being a journalist that gets triggerd for being called a journalist
13:14 LMFAOOOO!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHHAH IM CRYING 😭😭😭😭😭😭
“The whole pronoun thing😂” you can’t do him like that
I wouldn’t label Simon a journalist, more of a pundit/host/media personality
From what I've heard, I hope it DOESN'T happen!
Eubank is insufferable. Mentally ill waffle can't listen to it
“They do the pronouns thing, I ain’t doing that” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He's a journalist he writes for newspapers, he might not like the title thinking he's above it but he's clearly not.
The attitude from people like SJ is amazing, he never sounds as clever as he believes he does.. he is clearly, obviously in awkward fan boy awe of Senior, so tries to undermine.. a fact!? Unbelievable 🥊
I dont get what the issue is… Ethnicity and Nationality are not the same😂😂😂😂😂 Let the man be Jamaican😂😂
Get on with it eubank I’m bored
Simon Jordan is not a journalist he’s a fool
What does Simon think he is? A boxer?
I can listen to Chris talk aallll day. This guy is elegant.
He’s so bitter with promoters yet he blew through freaking millions and millions of dollars
Floyd Mayweather went from 130 to 170 , the most dedicated fighter and a true master of his craft. The Mayweather family stick with one another x
Chris is right he brought in millions for them no doubts.
I 100% agree
Why hasn’t Chris Eubank been sectioned ??
Chris is a highly enlightened man highly intelligent .rare people can understand his inner level.
Hes a journalist!😂😂😂
Eubanks best talker
Agbonlahor makes me suicidal when i hear him speak.. thick as a pound of mince.
😂😂😂😂😂
He just chucks in surrogate willy nilly
Simon is the angriest man on the internet
You are deluded 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eubank 🥊 speaking the unsavoury Truth once again🇬🇧🇯🇲
We need some parliamentary procedure here
If passive aggressiveness was a product, Great Britain's economy would be unstoppable.
Hang on Jim..ooh Betty.
Simon ya journo
1st time I watched this all the way through.  This is so funny ,Chris had me rolling up in stitches 😂😂
Who is that guy simon? He like kid,trying to win any argument and show that he is right everytime,so arrogant,but Chris Eubank Absolutely Destroys him EVERYTIME,,,,EUBANK IS A BOXER—->GLADIATOR !!!!!! And those other two guys,just questio after question because they don’t know things or don’t understand….
Eubank is fing hilarious😂
hahahahah You talk from the two sides of your face lololol
Funny 😁 get smacked in the teeth getting called by eubank snr  he's a journalist and than Eddie hearn calling him a disc jockey. million dollars box office.
Easy Dreadlocks 😂
Harlem is a harder fight than Junior
"HE'S A JOURNALIST!!" Mr Eubank sat him down with that 😂
This way Chris randomly switches into the Jamaican accent😂😂
Didn't age well for Chris. Fight is scheduled now for 160!
This isn't Eubanks real voice, god only knows why he puts it on.
Chris is the only man to shut these pair or wollys up for 5 mins straight 😂 brilliant 👍🏻 Chris has more knowledge in boxing in his big toe than these idiots
Chris snr talked the talk and walked the walk so his opinion counts
Simon interviewed/discussed with him, on radio interviewing him here   = journalist, ha ha ha Mr EUbank got him well shirty, BTW Chris, since brexit was a yes!! Shouldn't you and your family now be just called Chris bank lol
12.22 brilliant 😂
Settle your differences in the ring gentlemen! Eminently watchable - the interview I mean!
0:28
13:14
Simon seriously needa a clip.
Is Eubank, Floyd May weather's Fadda, from a distance, looks like an older version of Floyd may weather, funny thus though, Eubank is too good
Senior is too smart for Simon😂
“Hey come on the show… I DONT NEED YOU 😡👉”
0:25
Simon is 100% a journalist, that’s literally what he is. He’s a muppet as well
Eubank knows what he's talking about....
im sorry simon but you are a JOURNALIST LOL
Chris eubank is a leg end 🦵 his personality just adds to his legacy no one else like him in the ring or outside the ring and he made simon look like a right clown and simon knows it
Chris eubank is someone that allways thinks he's right
Senior gives his son to much credit. He only beats people that were never really that good. If it wasn't for a rich promoter, Matchroom would have never been on the world level. An they don't have one fighter that belongs there now.
Simon isn’t even a good journalist
This Simon goofball thinks wayyyyy too highly of himself
Eubank is delusional. He still has the same chip on his shoulder since he felt that he sold out too cheaply.
It's funny watching this again simple Simon is just a tit on toast
We need to see more of Chris ubank snr , he knows much ,
classic
We wouldnt be watching this to just watch these  2 journalist presenters so hes essentially right they are too smug to admit it 😂
He's got to make it about him to make his son more money, unfortunately he's carrying a big name. Its promoting so don't tell him it's all about him Mr middle man, the viewer doesn't even know who you are !!
Chris Eubanks has delusions of grandeur.
Simon, lets be honest is a nobody.😡😡
What a DRIBBLE .WE ARE ALL BREATHING BECAUSE OF CHRIS .THIS HES A GOD .N.OB
He indetifies as an entrepreneur rather than a journalist
He is a journalist
It’s rude to point then starts pointing 😂
Simon's a shock jock.
Jim Whyte “never mind him, what is he?” Contradictory at its finest
is jnr not his official son?
'You talk out of 2 sides of Your Face' lol give it to him Eubank Snr
BREAKING NEWS!  Simon Jordan on verge of leaving debate of him being a journalist!  Reports say he is a 'Sports pundit' until he looked at his contract and learnt he was a ..........................  Keep tuned to find out what Simon Jordan actually does for a living.
Simon is astonished when he discovers that people don’t share the high opinion he has of himself.
Journalist Jordan
He may be well spoken and quite laid back but I guarantee he would still knock the grannies out of anyone at anytime 😂
Don’t think Simon is a journalist, more like a radio host/personality, can you say anyone who works in radio is a journalist? Does that make every pundit a journalist?
His team juiced him up 😂😂
Its rather i don't know what the word journalist means or you are deluded😂😂😂😂
It still puzzles me how Eubank Snr created a son lol!.
Two egos debating the severity of their ego.
Eubank sr outsmarts outclasses theze 2 asszz holes he speaking 2. Big up eubank sr total gentleman respect
✨Simply The Best...👑💚💛❤️
Champion
Entrepreneur that ran a football team aground? Celebrating failure right?
Chris Eubank can make sense without making any sense 😂
To anybody having a bad day is feeling low, put a video of Eubank on he will brighten up your day 😂
Hes an amazing one off.
12:39
HIS A JOURNALIST
eubank sr just gave Simon Jordan a spanking
Chris "The Sheriff" Eubank.
Simon meet his MATCH😂😂😂
Stupendous confectionary
What a pillock
Eubank well up on the cards 😂😂😂
the fake journalist vs the fake sheriff 😊.
This man has serious mental health issues I feel sorry for Jr
I love Chris but he cannot question Conor's opponents and then big-up Harlem. Compare their records. Yes, Harlem would be the natural, physical opponent to fight Benn but anyone who's seen him fight will agree that Benn blows him away within a couple of rounds. Different levels....
Harlem needs to wake up, this man is sisck and delusional
Jnr had to separate from Snr to maintain self-respect and healthy boundaries.   Snr's ego, sense of superiority and need for control is way too much for any healthy person to tolerate being around.
Simon thinks hes hard man in a Guy Ritchie movie
Go on Chris!  Say it like it is. Classic interview journalism!
he’s 100% a journalist lol
What an idiot
Eubank essentially holding court whilst wearing a sherrif’s badge is genuinely incredible.   I do believe he is correct in saying that he adds more value to a fighter after being in their corner… from a personality point of view.
"Yes you are are" 😂😂
Chris loves a rusty sheriffs badge.
100% senior is right Conor benn has did absolutely nothing in boxing. He’s a clown 🤡 grabbing the coat tails of his dad Nigel benn. If his father want who he was we would have never heard of Conor benn
He’s a gobshite nobody who will talk about other people and teams in the limelight because he thinks it makes him somebody!
I don't know how many times I said it, the shows name is all wrong, it's Simon and Jim VS the other guess (except Danny murphy) and everybody else who agrees with him. Jim & Simon V Martin known. There I fixed it for you. Pricks.
He's a journalist lmao
Simon “Don’t point Chris, it’s rude” Not two minutes later Simon is pointing at Chris in anger 😂
Simon Jordan is a deejay.
Eubank > Jordan
Christ....he's long gone. He was already fucked up. But look at him now? Jesus Hitler Christ😊
So it’s true, all journalists are cnuts
No one is promoting your name Chris they are promoting your sons ..why do you always have to make it about you..your not even his manager or trainer so why are you always chatting crap
"He's trying to get traction in the world of gladiator's "   😂😂😂
Poor Chris. Amusing though he is he's not the sharpest tool in the box
chris eubanks and conor both arent top draws. just being honest.
Absolutely awesome interview with Eubank lol😂LMAO
Eubank senior is back to his usual self,he looks sharp+ happy.FairPlay to Harlem eubank for using his head,for bringing his grandfather into his boxing career,this will benefit him no end.i can’t understand why his son Chris eubank junior turned his back to his father,+ went to Roy jones junior,a man that was born to box,he could do tricks in the ring moves like no other.born with talent.chris will never be Roy jones junior,I believe if he had stuck with his father,he would be world champ now.
That was great fun
He’s def a journalist 😂
Eubank is the Man
He might be articulate but Simon Jordan is the most arrogant man in Britain
Simon Jordan is an absolute tool.   Pure narcissistic, belittling, up himself. And also, a journalist.
Jim having a ball of a time haha 😅
HES A JOURNALIST!!! 😂😅
30 years on from first watching Eubank as a fighter I still can't determine if he is a genius or an absolute whopper. Please advise accordingly
genuinly lost the plot this fucker hahahahahaha
Still a journalist.
Simon Jordan, pipe it you journalist muppet! Does anyone actually like this man?
3 wind up merchants in the same studio.
I don't know whether it's more absurd that someone pays this insufferable pillock to give his opinion or that there are lots of people willing to listen to it. What an absolute sorry state of affairs.
Eubank took control and made them listen 😂
The difference between simon talking to Chris and talking to Eddie Hearn is hilarious 😂😂
0:28 😂
This conversation is not about the truth. It is about egos. It is about who’s right, not what’s right. That’s the problem with the whole conversation.
Chris always talks way too much
Eubank, beaten by a heart and warrior..
That last bit was fire. Simon's a journalist!!!
Talk Sport 🔥
The problem is Chris doesn't wait long enough to listen to the whole point being made by anyone before he has to hear his own voice to satisfy his insane ego. Thus he is ill informed on what others may have said.
This man is clearly? Mmmm
Chris Eubank senior is a legend. An absolute legend.
Don’t point Chris it rude.. then he does the said same thing to Chris.  Just pull over the ramp, Chris, and gives some Arsenal licks like his daddy..
100% a journalist
Sometimes i dont know if hes mad or a genius
Medically unwell, hope he gets the help he needs.
"simon's role in boxing" peanut gallery?
I have noticed Simon is a super two  face guy😂😂 Did he forget that he was also being rude by pointing at Eubank Snr or he was having his senior moment😂
This is the problem with 2 idiots having a radio show, they can hang up on callers and with no-one ever there showing them how often they're wrong, and how and where they are wrong, they're deluded into believing themselves to be correct
Pompous hypocrite vs legend
The sheriff said you’re a journalist!
This man can sell fights and he's retired hahah can listen to snr all day long
So, getting paid to watch and comment on sports with an opinion (right or wrong) is bad??? Being a journalist seems like fun because you skip all the training and wear and tear of the actual sports but still involved in the world of them. SJ should embrace it because that's exactly what he is, and that's okay.
Dont point fingers Chris its Rude then within the next 60 seconds points at him with both hands I counted about 12 times, TS need to get people with manners
Simon is painfully insecure
Eubank is a legend ❤😂
He’s not a journalist. He’s a disc jockey 😂
Sorry missed  the joke here….. now you have a nephew now you dumped your son….. turn it in , turn it in, it’s all the inside knowing and cloak and daggers. Manipulate the monopoly, go away Chris you clown
Oh my god the history is just that……. It’s in the past Chris, you were good your Son isn’t
What’s the craic with the sheriffs badge? He’s got a rusty one I’ll give him that
Hahaha Jordan is such a fool
sport is boring and pointless
Eubank and the journalist Jordan need to be aired once a week, radio Gold
lol love him or hate him, chris eubank senior is pure box office lol
13:22 -😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Oh dear
Insane 😂
SNR is a real legend!
Journalist - a person who writes for newspapers, magazines, or news websites or prepares news to be broadcast 🤓
Eubank senior has always been a Hard AF annoying tw@...But notice Simon is Submissive in this debate!! Unlike Simon who jumps all over People normally used a different tactic!!?..Soft and Intellect...See the difference to Dumb and even with Money 👏👏👏
Just a shame Mrs Merton isn’t here anymore to put big head back in his box again
The ego of Simon to try to redefine what is or isn't a Journalist 😂   You interview people for a living and you write articles for the papers. You don't have discussions with your mates or peers, you're hired to interview people, ask structured questions preplanned before you meet the guest, and you do research on the guest beforehand. That's a Journalist  At best if you want to call yourself a media personality or a Z list celebrity that would also suffice, but Journalism is at least a real media form and youve had some engaging conversations with respected sports personalities
Good fighter, but my god he sounded like an utter narcissist here.
Once again chris is right and they can't take it
8:03 who isnt going to pay ppv to watch harlem vs benn?   A lot of people who arent even aware harlem eubank exists? Plus people will boycott buying benns fights as punishment of this failed drug test situation...
Simon and Jim the classic example of an old boys club. The way they suck on each other through every difficult interview is nauseating
Bumbaclart!!! Jamican posh accent was crazy
He's an opinion journalist.
Hello Chris fancy a pimms
I enjoyed this but I’ve no idea why.
Simon Jordan is a real-life David Brent, lol. Absolutely melted down Chernobyl-style after getting rightfully branded a journalist.
For someone talking about dreadlocks his got Fokol hair
damm comments are going loopy, but if this is not a soundbite - eubank was being a dikk right off the bat.  was he wrong factually?.. no lol
Simon is such a angry man 😂
Defs a journalist
Mouth on the left, "Chris don't point, it's rude",  a few minutes later the mouth on the left starts pointing after Chris pulled apart his tripe 😂😂😂
If he's not a journalist, what is he then? A boxer? A cameraman? A producer?
the real question is, then what does Simon think he is?
Simon sounds like he wants Eubanks to beat his ass. Lol
This interview was the best. Snr is different loooool Jordan didnt know what corner he was supposed to go back to to retire on his stall
Eubank waffles alllll day
Snr don't half talk some shite
This just reaffirms my view of Chris Eubank as an absolutely mental self centered arrogant muppet!
Simon is a journalist who talk from two sides of his face 😅😅😅😅😅
Conor Benn talking about Crawford is as wild as Eubank talking about Canelo 😂
Why are the eubanks both smug little worms
chris eubank jr would never beat canelo 😂😂😂and his old man has lost it and is desperately trying to stay relevant
Whats with the badge he wearing all the time
Eubank owned him
Sherrif was correct 100 percent, these journos are terrible
Unprofessional but funny
Simon Is either a Journalist or a DJ😂
Jordan is a clown
Simon ain’t even even had a fight in the playground.. but has a lot of to say about others accomplishments..FOH
Say what you want but Snr is always in immaculate shape and a legend
Chris is a self righteous narcissist. And if you don’t know what that means? Go and look it up.
There’s nothing funnier than a angry red white man
It's not hard to feel vastly superior to Chris Eubank is it.
My guy went into random Jamaican patois when talking about his influence to promote, straight G!! 😂😂
Sheriff is back.❤
Have senior on every few months.
He’s proper delusional is Eubank
Simon is a Journalist and YouTuber.. And he pays for his interviews to get his channel views. Chris is absolutely correct.
Simon: "So it's about you?" Eubank: pause - "Get this clear - yes."  No pullback, total commitment 😂
Love Chris
Have a scrap
Chris Eubank Sr is the living embodiment of pure box office. Can't remember the last time I've belly laughed watching talksport. One of the few people who gives Simon a genuine headache 😂
There's a pattern with Simon well annoying unsubscribed
Know your place S(l)imey!
2 pompous pricks
Making a N unhappy is pretty hilarious to me 😂 well done sj
Chris is spot on legend
How can a grown man not know what his own job is?
Eubanks the Best!
Simon is so bitter
Chris has a point, you are now a journalist Simon.
Simon you journalist’s 😃
Jim's face at 7:18 😂😂😂
Simon just go away , total loser. Eubank totally owned in that conversation, you muppet.
hell have Jr. fight GGG
Simon hates he can’t walk over Chris, 😂😂 he a journalist 😭😭
Jim white always trying to save Simon from destruction… I bet Simon couldn’t survive on his own, even Jim…
Simon Jordan really does stink.
Eubanks is the truth 💯
160 is his weight 🤣🤣🤣 jesus
Coldest intro of all time 🤣🤣, Chris never disappoints
Harlem will never be a world champion he just doesn't have the ability, i'm saying he's a good domestic foghter and it's obvious why Eubank want's to be involved he needs the money.
Simon can’t say his r’s the journo cu** 😂😂 I
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 The Eubanks are a family of gladiators.
Simon Jordan is a pundit not a journalist. Pundits offer insights, journalists present news worthy resources (images/video/written work).
Simon is painful
all i see is a bloke who cant not deal with not being centre of attention and being in the spotlight, all makes sense now it was never about jr, it was all about how he was trained and managed and also he wanted to be in all the pictures and in the ring and interviews and now jr has got rid of him finally and is forging his own path and has come into his own with his own witty sense of humour and entertainment and hes also earned respect from the public that wasnt there anymore, hes more successful now daddys gone and daddy doesnt like it and is now doing the same thing with harlem, guarantee he promotes the hell out of him now so he can try robbing his career too, get this tosspot off tele for good hes an absolute joke hasbeen, off his rocker
Eubank is Soul!
You got to love Chris
like him or not, he is box office.
I AM PROUD THAT I WAS THE ONLY BOY OF COLOUR THAT DID NOT HATE EUBANK IN SEPTEMBER 1990 WHEN HE FOUGHT BENN
boxing makes me laugh with weight cuts, go watch MMA if you wanna talk about drastic weight cuts lol. There is a weight class every 3lbs in boxing, it’s a joke
He talks just as hard as he fought.. Great fighter and we need more like him in the sport just now.
😂😂I think people would take on the chin more what Simon said and get less irritated if he just admitted he’s sports journalist and all hes ever said is because it’s his job to critic these things 😅 so funny his denial. Clearly a very intelligent man who deep down loves doing the very thing he despises most!  The man’s an oxymoron haha
Simon is a first class  🤡
Love SnR
Sr is right about one thing what has CONNOR BENN DONE????? Talking about crawford and spence ???? Hes talking like hes a somebody😒
I mean he’s a journalist 😂😂, if he doesn’t want that title I’ll happily give him “influencer”
Legend .
Simon is the one who said hes "climbing on the shoulder of giants" and gets the hump when Chris agrees with his statement. Poor simon was on the proverbial ropes punch drunk!!!
12:10  chris' face
8:49 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 12:12 Chris activated the gladiator instinct😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chris is so hilarious. Absolutely love him.  "HE PAID ME, HE PAID ME MONEY TO COME TO HIS STUDIO AND HAVE AN INTERVIEW, HE IS A JOURNALIST!"   🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sad his son disowned him now hes pumping his nephew out to try stay relevant.
No...he's a radio journalist....Simon can't accept it but literally everyone thinks he's a disc jockey
Snr is still pissed that Jnr binned him off & doesn’t need him lol. You being in his corner or not against canelo makes no difference, it’s the same result 🤣 if anything your more of a distraction
There's nothing Simon does straight down the line...he's so desperate to be a boxing promoter 😂
Chris is legeng 😅...Not sure about the referring to harlem as the 'surrogate son' though lol
Rastafari 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Simon is 2 faced
Embarrassing absolute clown.
Eubank is the most deluded narcissistic clown 🤡 going … pure entertainment but a sausage
Jordan has potentially a useful role in boxing as a punching bag
Eubank Snr absolutely dominated Simon there, you can see he didn't like it!
Chris is the Sherriff of boxing. Ive said what ive said! Legendary 😂
Come on simon your a journalist 😂
Great tension throughout this, Jim and Simon are gold, Chris is a diamond. Great show all round.
Simon.. you're a journalist..its very simple.
MATCH ROOM NEED TO BEHAVE THEMSELVES
Tbf Simon is a journalist. Get it together Simon, you’re not a gladiator son, you’re a journalist, and a decent one at best son
Absolute fruit cake
Simon Jordan “I’m straight down the line” That is true but you change your opinion as the wind changes direction
The Jordan, v  Eubank  fight Would be better than the Connor Ben versus Eubank fight And the winner should take on Eddie Hearn
Eubanks right he is a journalist.
Simon your a journalist and a pundit 😂
If you agree, it does not make good listening
Chris is really strugglling with his mental health at the moment which is pretty well known about. Completely unacceptable from Talksport to have him on in my opinion
Chris Eubank Senior is one of the most based individuals to have ever walked this earth.
Im gonna have to agree with him on in the promoter point
I never knew chris also trained in sartocially ellegant texas ranger department what a artfull and inspiring fellow citizen we see here today eubank seniour
Not sure what Simon identifies as but he's definitely a journalist and quite a wormy one hahahah
So why can he fight dobson???
Eubank...the clown who pretended to talk on his mobile to impress some birds in brighton in the 90s and his phone rang in his ear😂
Is Jim trans?
The fact Simon thinks he might actually know that top dons controlling boxing 😂 I believe she could get benns licence back
So we lose against the big teams and we bottle the league last year and then we win against the big teams and still bottle the league. We need a title.
Eubank had that knob so rattled at the end 😂😂 how does he think he’s not a journalist shows his arrogance
Euabanks just brilliant
Chris is an Eco-Maniac
Eubanks the one who beat Benn then thought nobody's for years British champion never had a fight out of UK. Did not want Roy jones James toney Micheal Nunn and many more
Eubank = entertainment period!
They mention Liam Smith & Eubank responds 'dont want to get into that' 🤯...fool
Who the fck *is* this Jordan character anyway?
Simon your a journalist
If this discussion was happening in a pub, no cameras… Simon would be a little less confrontational! 😂
Why doesn’t he have the same passion about his son Nathaniel? He should be ashamed of himself
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Chris is a riot!
Now we're getting into the deeply rooted philosophical question we all came here for: is punditry a form of journalism?  Twats.
Why is this even a conversa.. ohh sorry Simon didn't see you there 😂
Chris is absolutely right. These mere Journalists do not know a thing about boxing or fights....Full stop.
Bottom line your a journalist. U geting angry with chris is an insult
Simon is a journalist and he knows it lol
Man said you are deluded hahah class!
why have I got this feeling that this is the ladt time we see Chris eubank snr on talksport 😢 he literally shut them down
Chris is absolutely correct, if you report on sports news and have a show where you interview sports stars asking them questions about the past and present then you are a journalist… and yes you do need to sit on the shoulders of giants because without them you have nothing to talk about on this and your interview show 😅😅😅
He is definitely a journalist 😂 ….. eubank is correct ….. eubank definitely had to many punches to his head aswell.   Great interview tho enjoyed it
Eubank is box office. English county gent 😂❤
He's more than a journalist he was a multimillionaire who lost it and reinvented himself as a journalist nothing wrong with that but put some respect on the guy he started from Zero made it and lost it all, big up yourself Jordan I dnt always agree with him but the way he stood his ground against Eddy Hearn was funny and made me like Jordan more
Chris knows the boss 💪🏼
Simons a juiced up journalist looool Chris Snr is a legend. RASTAFARIH
Reading the comments I can’t see any reaction to the delusions of Snr and his belief’s to have connections to the ‘boss’. Is weird.  Was an entertaining snippet but kinda pointless imo. If Snr is so well connected I’m sure he can manufacture decent fights for Harlem - but fact remains Snr has no connection with reality.   Love eubank snr, but am worried for his health. ❤  The labelling of Jordan as a journalist is golden. 😂
eubank is a BOSS 😂
Simon, you are a journalist.
He whistles when he talks 🤣
Rastafari ✊🏾
The Journalist SJ is so used  to belittling and so impressing the I'll educated with a few of his well rehearsed and ober used words and phrases. Unfortunately for him Chris has an arguably wider intellect than SJ, is far bigger  public personality and possesses a far greater ego. For this reason SJ always finds himself the second most listened to person in the room once Chris has entered........and that REALLY bugs him and his legion of simple minded sycophants. 🤣😂🤣😂
Simon hated it but Chris is 100% right😂😂
Did he fight a top American ?????..... Rastafari 😂
Simon does a wonderful job in getting the most patient and calm people riled up. You have to know Simon will never acknowledge in the moment that the person is right if they make any statements about Simon.
Rastafari! to you Sir Christopher Livingston “English” Edward Gordon Eubank.
I’m trying to work whilst listening to this. It’s like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest 😅.
I love the way he says,  I'm finished
Born Narcissist.
Shame to see Eubank like this. Hope he gets the help he needs.
Simon Im confused, why are you arguing with the truth ? You’re a journalist, point blank period !! 😂😂😂
This is really sad actually. He is going on the radio and digging out his son, because he has another little minion in Harlem.   Harlem is 19-0 and has fought literally nobody who even throws back yet.
The GOAT Sheriff.
. You are a journalist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOOL
Stupendous interview from senior
😂😂😂. Eubanks snr is bonkers.
Sounds like he hating on his son
Typical Englishman!  Can't go 2 minutes without contradiction.   Tells Chris not to point at him because it's rude , only to point at Chris 2 minutes later .🙄   The English are the fathers of Hypocrisy and double standards are just a way of life .  Instead if calling him a journalist,  he should have just said you are a hypocrite !
Chris is a legend ❤❤❤❤❤❤
2 arrogant, egotistical human beings try to one up each other.
You can identify as anything these days.  If Simon want to be a space explorer and not be seen as a journalist that’s his right 😂
you can tell that one hurt Simon
Eubanks a weirdo.
I respect the level of bullshit that Chris Eubank can muster in order to sell one of his lads a fight
Definitely a journalist 😂
Or a DJ 🤣🤣
Pure entertainment is Chris. Being punched in the head all those years have definitely taken its toll Rastafarian Dreadlocks 😂
Eubank is mad. He,s been going mad for the last 20 year. I know him. He,s nut's!!!!!
I wish Eubank Sr and his surrogate son the best. 😂
Simon Jordan said it's rude to point then point's at Snr
You’re a knob Simon. Is what you are
He asks people questions to give information to the public - so he's a journalist. But I use the term loosely given he's rubbish.
I'm bloody proud of Chris for handling that interview with perfection
Chris winning the Dapper contest lol
Simon is a journalist and he’s got a few quid from banging out mobile phones before the big boys came in so he thinks he’s something special. Obnoxious worm.
Got to love how he’s protecting his son if a fight was going to happen he has to go up to his weight makes sense
He’s a journalist 😂😂😂😂😂😂
eubank is too intelligent for simon 😂 simon cant speak about two things at once
I avoid talkSPORT videos even when the algorithm – can't vibe with the format and personalities – but I did watch this for Eubank Sr's personality. Entertaining to say the least.
Jordan the Journo
Simon u tiny lil journalist
This disc jockey is getting too big for his boots. 🤦‍♂️
Chris we love you
Jim Whites face in the middle is class. 🤣🤣
So is Eubank Snr alluding to the possibility he had something to do with Benn being doped by his team? Pretty bold claims here, either he is talking utter cow pat, or he has pulled strings.
Jim's reaction at 7:18
Top lad proper journo
Wow simon can’t even admit he is a journalist… bizarre!
Eubank is absolutely brilliant. Love him or hate him - What a character
Simon a journalist hahaha that rattled him hard, face red as a tomato! 💀💀💀💀
Thing is, Simon isn’t even a journalist. Journalists go out and meet people and do research. Simon is a cheap shock jock pundit
Eubank's a proper berk!
Chris is brilliant entertainment 😂
Chris came to try and get one back on Simon because of what Simon said about his son the last time… he’s a weird guy Chris
Simon thinks he’s in Green Street’ “I’m not a journalist”
100% a journalist
I just noticed eubanks sheriffs badge lol
8:20 thought he didnt want to talk about cheats
Snr is right, SJ is salty. TalkSport gave SJ a platform and the ego developed. He's no expert in boxing, just someone with an opinion, mostly a wrong one.
“Don’t point Chris, that’s rude”   Proceeds to point when he gets rattled
Chris Eubank is the greatest!
Simon careful now your arguing with a lion
Weird thing is after Benn’s last two performances I’d say Harlem vs Conor isn’t that bad a fight … calling out the likes of Crawford and Haney is laughable… no where near that level yet… could be one day but no where at the moment.
I was waiting for eubank to slip back into his south london accent..think he'd have to be properly wound up for that to happen
Chris blabs some rubbish…tries to come across as an intellectual…mate…stop looking down on people and understand where others are coming from…no wonder Benn hates you so much 😂
Eubank spitting facts
Harlem and benn are both at simular stages in the careers too. Eubank jr been around alot longer than benn
Listening to the ego of Chris Eubank is alarming. Huge respect for his career but he is clutching to any sense of relativity
I like Chris but he is all talk. An irishman put him in the ground twice on live tv.
Simons irrellevant in Boxing why do we listen to him ,,,Chris is a Boxing legend im glad he looks down at simon
Is there anyone more disrespectful in media than Jim White, who's he showing off to with his little faces he pulled. Horrible
Senior really is on one here.. this fella needs needs to call it a day. Shame on TalkSport for bringing him on.
Good Conversation ✌️👏
U ah look pun it right yeh soh dreadlox😂😂😂😂
Simon: Who's the boss Eubank Snr: I can't tell you😅😅😅
Love Chris and Simon, top banter
Whilst this interview was funny it just amplifies the reason I can't be bothered with boxing. Lies, deceit, games, posturing, wasted time and not a lot of boxing. ( "I know the boss") Zzzzz.
You can't deal with old skool chris... man just did a 3 hit combo on Simon and theador😅😅
'a person who writes news stories or articles for a newspaper or magazine or broadcasts them on radio or television' Cambridge Dictionary...Your a Journalist Mr Jordan, among other things...suck it up!
Senior has lost it
Simon met his bogey man 😂
I would love conelo to teach him a lesson twice
What a sausage
He used to live in Hartington Road Brighton. Absolute Gentleman, trying to live hjis best life as always. Used to stand at the door doing his postures before he was a recognised man. Say it as you see. Mr Eubank knows 'The Craic.' Respect.X Whatever game you in it not easy being true. Chris does it in spades.
When two narcissists collide 💥 😂
Harlem beats Conor Benn??? Eubank Snr is buzzing for sure, no way Harlem beats Conor Benn.
Simons just a fan, nothing wrong with that. Very little knowledge mind you.
Eubank snr is a weird guy what on earth was with that introduction lol
And Simon is ALWAYS 100% with his observations about people right...right?
Eubank was a great fighter. But he’s an absolute pleb of a human.
Snr controlled the room. And simon hated that
Daddies delusional
Let's get Chris Eubank on and wind him up a bit, it'll make great viewing. Chris Eubank: "You are a journalist". Entrepreneur: "No I'm not".
Allow Eubank to education you both on boxing
Chris is brilliant. Simon you are a journalist mate
Big up Chris dun know 👊🏾
I think Chris Eubank is great.....
I like Senior
Unfortunately or fortunately, you’re a journalist mate.
😂😂😂😂😂
Eubank snr is a clown.lost the plot. Nobody wants you in boxing
Eubank just promoting his other son. He needsto shut up.trying to promote himself off his sons.thats why his sons are distancing themselves
Keep banging on about Harlem like a he is a world beater he is a no one in terms of top boxers or even prospects
Only thing I agree with Chris in this whole interview is the fact Simon is a journo 😂
Simon absolutely triggered lol.
Hey chris can you stop that jamaican ting please its cringey as hell, tankin you rasta yeah
Chris is a legend.
Chris eubank is a total embaressment
Whatever you think about Eubank snr. he is always box office
Howdy sheriff
“He’s trying to get traction in the world of gladiators” - Chris Eubank snr 2024
The journalist tells Chris not to point then goes on to point several times at Chris lol
Big up senior really top man
He was 160 in his last fight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Senior, simply the best.
The pronoun thing 😭
‘Who are you talking about then?’ ‘I can’t tell you’   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eddie Hearn must be laughing like a drain watching this !
This is class, two proper characters 😂
Chris Eubank is the only person who can tell Simon to shut up and he actually shuts up 🤣
Almost as good as Hearn calling him his favourite disc jockey 😂
Eubank is wearing a sheriffs badge 😂
Weirdo
8:40 the best part 😂love eubank senior he’s just quality can listen to him all day long
Shut that fool up
Ledge
Chris out-Jordaned Jordan
Jordan: I’m in total agreement with you, but what you’re saying is ridiculous… love this guy.
Eubank ❤
Aa much as i love him, it gets harder and harder to lisren to Eubanks Snr
Why does he hate being called a journalist when that's his job??
SNR is gold
“A journalist trying to get traction in a world of gladiators”. Epic takedown!!!
Simon is such an unlikeable person, he hates it when he can't ask a question and then answer it for the person.
No1 can argue with what snr says its on point that guy was and still is british gold
Simon fuming 😡 😡😡😂😂😂😂
simon the type of man to talk like he is hard but when he gets slapped he calls the police, SIMON STOP PRETENDING TO BE HARD!!!!!
Journalist 😂😂
Harlem isn’t a big enough name to be in the ring with Conor benn. If Senior wants Harlem to fight Benn,fight him in the USA.
Any real boxing fan doesn’t want to see this that fight. Different weight class full stop. Junior should be fighting for those world titles with Charlo and Canelo.
Simon a journalist his ego cant take that far to lowly idea/label to have of himself
Chris Eubank is Dudley from Street Fighter
Anything but
Man sed he dont need him but paid him to be on the on the podcast 😂
Deluded guy wake up Simon u journalist
Senior's disbelief at Simon not accepting that he's a journalist is incredible 😂
I've saved this under playlists Interviews & comedy.
He loves the sound of his own voice this fella ?
Ffs when will someone talk n shut the ninja turtle up, me me me 😂
“I’m a journalist last time you saw me……apparently according to you!” Pure David Brent right there
Chris Eubank featuring Talksport.
Simons a journalist. How’s he confused & in denial? What would he rather be? A failed chairman?🤡🤡😂
Of course he's not a journalist. It's not even slightly up for debate in reality
The milky bar kid looks different😂
Reach dreadlocks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simon says it's rude to point then 10 mins later he's pointing 😂
Imagine having Chris Senior as your dad.  Your mobile rings - do you pick up? 😂
Simon thinking he's not a journalist is the perfect definition of gaslighting...the guy's mental
Chris hasn't been the same since he lost his son. He's kinda lost his marbles, eg. delusions of grandeur
I don’t understand this ,they know Eubank snr is a looney crackpot so why bring him on national radio
Simon constantly changes the argument, ‘you’re a journalist’  Listen Chris I don’t need for anything!
100% right Simon is a journo all day long
Simon really hates himself 😂
Bloke lost it bad mentality not right
TMNT
We need a Simon and snr show 😂
Simon living in denial. You Are A Journalist man! Clown!
Jordan needs to wind his neck in and get back to work as a journo
13:15 this was gold 😂
Harlem gets destroyed by Benn
Why is simon tryna to argue like a women just looking for a argument
💯with Chris on this one and put some respect on his name you journalist 😂
Love Eubank. He’s so right here too. Simon does talk out two sides of his face, does it constantly and then acts smug when half his “opinion” comes to fruition. And yes he absolutely does need people like Eubank, all pundits/journalists do, they’re nothing without them.
Chris Eubank Snr has always been odd but now has completely lost the plot what an absolute tool, hope talksport don’t bother having him back on and I really hope Conor and Chris get the fight on and watch him try and stop it. What will he do run into the ring naked and handcuff himself to the ropes hahaha
Harlem v Benn.. I'm okay with that. Winner goes onto World Title Fights.
Snr is a sausage. Dobson is 16-0 with 9kos. And Harlem hasn't exactly fought anyone of an stature. A few 1hr channel FIVE shows aren't exactly prime time. Benn was right in recent interview. SNR is only cuddling Harlem because Jnr told him to leave the camp.
Eddie Hearn 2-0  Chris snr 2-0  Simon just keeps taking the L
lol they reported my comment. SIMON YOU ABSOLUTE SAUSAGE/JOURNALIST
"So its about you".  "Now get this clear.....Yes!!" What a guy!!
Jnr should fight Canelo or GGG
The only person who can keep Simon quiet, just comical from start to finish. Even Jim sits there perplexed at what he is listening to and he comes out with all sorts😂 of
Eubank packed simon his lunch and sent him going real well😂😊
The Sheriff is a British boxing icon. Never change English 👑🇬🇧🦁
Me me me
Man was triggered cheeks went red and all sorts.
Sorry Simon but you are now working as a JOURNALIST and a broadcaster. You have previously been a business owner and it is good that you can speak from that perspective unlike other journalists but the majority of you work now is either writing columns, radio and YouTube. I'm sure you have some other interests on the side but main profession is journalism. You've now made a Hill you have to die on for no reason and look a bit daft.
Jim loves it 😂😂😂
Chrisssssssssssssssss Eubank
Chris eubank needs help it’s ashame.
I've met both of these men many years ago. I was at school with Jordan and I can say with some degree of certainty, both are massive twats
Jim is suck suck up! He’s real lucky he’s got SJ next to him. Simon is box office, like or hate it, he’s entertaining!
It's now official, Simon Jordan is a journalist, and also a w*nker
I'me sure it should be a W not a B in his name! 🤔
PONR,,,,
Gold 😂
Rastafari!
Appreciate for the upload, keep 'em coming! 👍
Eubank is box office
He's so weird.
What else could Simon actually think he is? This guy is just an entitled English man who seems to think his bigger than what his role is, self created that it. If you want to be anything more get some gloves on and try do 3 rounds
you're a journalist. shame on you
HE'S A JOURNALIST!!!!!😂😂😂
“Everyone finds their levels”. That’s correct Simon, that’s why you are a talking head on Talksport these days.
Jim shite knows fukall.    Benn can fight in the uk, he isnt banned.   He can get any license other than bbbc which is ridiculous aswell but he isnt banned
Eubanks as always still totally self obsessed and all the rhetoric is all about his ego!
I would like to see the Harlem fight it’s not a bad match up …. Benn got beat by that French kid … let’s talk real
Simon Jordan is 100% a journalist.
hes hard work!
As frustrating as it must be to have even the most basic of chats with Snr, he remains box office gold.
Well this escalated quickly didn’t it 😮
last 5 mins solid gold - basically 3 people having 3 completely seperate conversations with each other
Fact he can get a license back shows how curropt boxing is
The man the myth the legend himself
What's the star on Eubanks jacket?
So its ' The Jim White and Simon Journalist Show ' from here on!
Jim is rattled on Simon's behalf. Wow
JR to fight Canelo for respect? did SNR fight Jones? Toney? Nunn? please leave your boy alone!
This guy man 😂😂 it’s all about me 😂😂
Chria got it spot on. Simon is a deluded, jumped up little loud mouth who can't back up big words... eubank is gladiator and simon is a charlatan
Chris eubank openly showing boxing corruption, thats the problem with boxing. If harlem eubank failed a test im sure that same contact would come in handy!! Ffs😂
Lmao, Simon finally being levelled
This guy is still seriously sick. Get him off
Simon was a businessman..... Key word being 'was'..... He now reports and comments on sport events...Although he probably likes to think he is something more...
Could listen to Sr talk for hours. Beg you stop trying to interrupt the man, also he’s right only here to listen for him thank you for bringing him on again.
Eubank is tiring to have a conversation with
He’s a journalist, it’s just facts.
Chris..... handled dem..... They get shock when fighters and people they no can fight buck up.... bless em...... So wot if he hit u..... stand up!!!  BUT CHRIS IS RIGHT.....AND IF HE WRONG... MAKE DEM COME ON THE SHOW AND SAY OTHERWISE.....  Funny Jim saying "their not here".... yet all week long he talks about footballer and mangers and they are not in the studio either..... odd that
Hahaha proper rattled him by calling him a journalist. Sr one of a kind
What utter nonsense this man spouts. He talks about Benn and what he hasn’t achieved and why he even mentions Crawford. Wasn’t this the same man calling for Junior to fight Golovkin ……… why? What did Jr achieve other than a loss to Saunders. Senior was in his corner when he lost to Saunders and Groves, so why would it be any different.
simon simon simon...😂
Eubank Sr is a joke.
Uncomfortable viewing. He's not right 😔
Simon got destroyed 😂😂Simon not accepting he's a journalist on a wage is hilarious 😅
He needs help
Simon is a journalist now and to be fair a pretty good one. He shouldn’t be ashamed.
Senior has lost the plot completely . This was a hard watch. Talksport should be absolutely ashamed of themselves .
Simon is a journalist but Eubank senior talks a lot of 💩 and is obsessed with himself
Simon is definitely a journalist 😂😂
Why would canelo fight Eubank , I doubt he’s ever heard of him
More delusion
Love him or hate him Eubank senior is TV gold
Im sorry but Chris has absolutely lost the plot since Seb died. Hes trying to live through his nephew know that Chris doesnt want him
He absolutely is a journalist, Eubank speaks the truth
Benn is irrelevant now ever since the drug scandals no one is interested in him he’s fighting bums now once one of them beats him end of benn
Jordan sized up perfectly and can’t take it  He’s a journalist He roots around for sports news stories He interviews people He tries to controversial to boost interest He is desperate for views just the same as paper sales… Senior was 100% correct 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Jordan obvs sees himself above thecreality
Calling his nephew his "surrogate son" is proper odd.
Simons a Journo, Simons a Journo.
😂😂😂😂😂 Simon you're a journalist
How is he not a journalist?!
Simon getting owned again . Journalist !!! 😂 he's right trying to make money of fighters . True
Too much of that sugar in him 😮
Gotta love Chris Eubank😂😂😂
Big difference between commentator or pundit and a journalist…
Chris is slagging the promotors off for thinking about the money, yet this and other interviews he done yesterday are clearly nothing more than him fishing for a pound note.
Eubank had got his sheriff badge on.  Hilarious watching him jumping up and down. No wonder JR got rid of him.
Losing brain cells listening to this fell
Simon is more of a Journalist than Jim 😂😂
Jim White constantly rims Simon Jordan.
Eubank talking anout his illuminati connections the boss 🔺👁️ 😂 but eubank is right if pete dobson can get the fight why cant Harlem Benn? And Simon getting upset about being a Journo pronouns😂😂😂😂
Chris Snr is absolutely right. You tell him.
Replace Simon Jordan with Sr full time, at least he knows what he is talking about when it comes to boxing
Just funny how off piste these heavy debates always go on talk sport 😂
Does Eubanks ever shut up
2 sides of ur face 😂😂😂😂
Eubank u legend school them shock jocks love it
i would pay to watch them fight
I don't think Harlem Eubank beats Connor Benn.  I would love to see Tank vs Benn.  A lot of animosity there.
Want a supercut of Cilla Black calling out one of her blind date contestants as being a journalist with Eubank sr. laying the same charge enthusiastically upon Simon Jordan.
Love Chris senior proper boxer but intelligent too boot put Simon in his place guys a legend gentleman  but a hard hard man love himn
Hmmmm  I feel like there is a little bit of jealousy from snr with regards to his own son.
Nothing but respect for Chris Eubank Snr. 👊🏿
Simon went from Disk Jockey in 2023 to a Journalist in 2024! 💯
I don’t get the confusion here! Simon is an entrepreneur yes….. but he’s defo also a Journo. Obviously ! He reports news and joins discussions and interviews on sports / news channels.. I have no doubt that he probably has a column somewhere out there too. He’s a journalist end of.
Eubank is an absolute DON
I could listen to Eubank all day, what a guy!
“Yuh ah look pon it right ere dreadlocks” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 we can never lose Eubank! Ever! Protect him at all costs!
Eubank jr really need to go for a middleweight belt and fast forget that benn fight, eubank is to small at super middle it was proved when he fought groves  Them super middles come down from around 195lb so in fight night they are bigger than jr
7:13 - When Snr slips into Jamaican patois I'm dying 😂😂.
gotta love Eubank  he's got class simon on the other hand....
Steve Collins
Simon is too funny 🤣🤣 I love him
I love Chris. He was a great fighter. But he fought plenty of Dobsons 😂
Hahaha go on Senior, Simon is a journalist 😂
I dont like how Eubank Snr puts Chris Eubank under him. It is ridiculous.  Chris is a man!!!!   GTF out trying to steal his shine. You had your time. Let him have his.
Is it me, or Jim white is a snarky prick
Chris' is great to listen to.A bit crazy but very honest and charming.
Stop bringing this idiot to the studio it’s all about him that’s why junior hasn’t won anything and the same will happen to his nephew if he stays with him
Snr owned Simon and Jim.
😂😂😂 Simon smashed all round the gaff by Senior so he was 👀🥊
People use the ad hominid attack to discredit Simon, but I know he will present well- packaged arguments and insightful opinions regardless of whether I agree or not. He is much more than a journalist
Still a journalist.
Snr and Jordan I am sure love each other really lol. But a charity match with these two, im paying!
That's all you are simon a journalist not on eubanks level so just listen to a proper expert
Conor is not ready for Crawford 😊
In the red corner we have Simon " The Journalist " Jordon !
Simon gets rattled so easy!
Definitely is a journalist
Eubank is so deluded he thinks he can take on Simon in a war of words, ive never seen anyone so self promoting and arrogant in what he did nearly 30 years ago, simon and jim went easy on him as they know how unstable he is, all quite pitiful.
Chris is right
Eddie Hearn labelled S Jordan 'one of my favorite DJ's'...........
Connor's arrogance and delusion is off the charts. He hasn't even won a British Title and he thinks he can mix with the best. LOL!!
Eubank is actually right.
I'm starting to get tired of simon. Im only watching this because of eubank. I cant listen to simons nonsense anymore.
Connor Benns trainers have a strong libel case there to sue Eubank. Watch this space, if they don’t it makes you wonder
I get the feeling Simon Jordan thinks he's some kind of media entrepreneur. If he owned TalkSport, or even had a share of the business, then I suppose he would be right. But as Jordan interviews people for money, and gives his opinion on subjects on air for money that makes him a journalist.
So Gary Neville , Jamie Garragher are journalists not tv pundits?
He may be eccentric but without a doubt snr is a true boxing great and when he talks Jordan shut up and listen
Chris: "Either I don't know what the word means or you are deluded" Simon: "or Both" Don't think Simon meant to imply that he's deluded 😂
Snr's ego is out of control he's needing to take a nap and give us all peace from him waffling
eubank to simon. i know what you are 🤣🤣🤣
chris looks like a jedi sheriff
When did John Daly cut his beard off ?
Chris gone mad lol
Can this guy ever open his mouth without mentioning his legacy or his reputation, neither are that impressive, he is a clown!
This guy and his random patois 😂😂😂😂
I love Eubank
None of you boxing fans get anything.... They build up the fighter and then put him in the big fights... Are you guys bright? No....
Wtf he keep saying surrogate dad?
Makes complete sense to put Benn vs Harlem, same weight Benn vs Eubank who is undefeated. go for it
Great entertainment
Harlam, run while you can.  The narcissist will chew you up.
Either I don’t know what journalist is you are deluded 😂😂😂😂 shots fired
Is he wearing a RUSTY SHERRIFS BADGE? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does he keep saying dreadlocks?
Simon Jordan is the biggest fake going. This bloke's ego is unbelievable. He thinks thick rimmed glasses make him an authority on everything. His podcast sucks and his general attitude is one of ignorance and hubris
Chris should be on this show everyday , steals the limelight and talks from the heart .....God help the lot of us !!!!
Jordan says the ECONOMICS of Harlen v BEnn isnt there. What the hell are the economics with the Dobson fight??????? Not many will watch that unless its a replay or highlights on YT
Didn't want this 'interview' to end 😂
Simon is as Deluded as Eubank🤣👍
Who has harlen fought
Two journos and eubanks
Chris Eubank is gold. What an absolute chap.
A Journalist.  A Complete Kock Too.
One of the best exchanges 😂😂😂
This is golden 😂
Eubank doesn't need a slot on talk sport. he just needs a mirror .
So is Chris trying to say that when he came into the realm the drug test fail happened on his account and is claiming Benn is innocent fishy
Batshit crazy 🥴🤣
Weird. I searched for the Southpark clip of Cartman saying, “Put a chick in it and make it f**king gay!”. Watched that and this was the next suggestion. Not sure what that says about these guys and this show 😂😂😂
Simon hated that, he is a journalist aint he? Lol
"Get traction in the world of Gladiators". Eubank Sr  100% correct. Give him a slap on the way out.
Simon disrespecting a legend here no way
Eubank is the goat
Simon wants to be known as knows everything and w eryone bows down to him . Salty
⬆8-0 betting so far in 2024, Boxing & UFC, ALL PLUS MONEY💰💰💰
Journalists are trained Simon is a pundit he gives his opinion.
Nutz
Sorry but Harlem Eubank is absolutely poo 😂
Cup of tea 🤣😂🤣😂
Chris, please just shut up…! You were a GREAT boxer. That’s it. Don’t you get it yet, the way you speak and what you say are a joke…? Your son Chris on the other hand is a truly intelligent and articulate guy and a really good boxer…entertaining fighting man. Harlem is very good too but not quite as entertaining. You need to stand back, rest on your laurels and let them do their stuff. The more you talk, the more stupid you look. Stop talking, let your sons get on with their lives and just revel in your previous glories.
Is Eubank a rasta now
Was hard work watching this 🙄
Bullshit, 147 fighters walk around at 180
Simon.......... you are journalist mate
Chris Eubank masterclass 😅

Plz not the Eubanks I carnt stand the arrogants from them both Eubank j ant good enough to be a champ Conner's beats them both by ko inside 4rnds
I hate the Scottish Paul O’Grady he makes me switch off.
Man, snr talks one almighty load of shite 99% of the time...
As entertaining and strong minded as Simon is, mentioning he’s a journalist is his achilles heel.
Cute how simon thinks hes not a journo
still a nutjob........😂

Snr's cheeky smile is brilliant 😂
Simon paid Chris because he believes that there's a lot of vacuous, uninformed, unchallenged opinions out there. He wanted to get to the bottom line and cut through the nonsense. He paid Chris because he has strong views, who thinks he can stand them up to proper scrutiny.  There was a good chance Simon might have learnt something along the way from the payment, and more importantly, so might have Chris, other than using the cash for more brasso to use on his badge!
Love this
Simon is out of his depth in regards to boxing. Always has been. He’s a just fan with a half decent knowledge of the sport. The sarcastic manner in which he casts his broad opinions gets views - great, but they don’t hold weight.
Remember the advert for eubank when he turned into a panther. I was a big star in the  early 90s
You talk out of two sides of your face Jordon
Haha....eubank talking the truth...when All is said and done...the world will remember eubank....cos he is a giant in his world to be fair...Will any one be too bothered about Simon and the other geezer...what's his name........ i Met eubank  once.he had time and words for every one...true champion of the people for sure .legend
Incredibly hard listening to Eubanks,correct or not it’s all a show for him😢
Conor Benn fights bums....and eubank jr couldn't beat canelo to save his life
There was one moment there where Simon was getting a bit feisty and you saw Eubanks facial expression completely change and it looked like he was about to chin Simon 😂
When Chris is well he’s on point 👌
I no the boss 🤣
Journalism at its finest
Why would Canelo want to fight a sparring partner like Chris JR
no one cares about harlem and who he fight
If the camera is rolling it's an interview not a discussion. Simple as that. Snr is right and SJ just doesnt want to admit it!
Honestly what is Chris on about. When did working on the radio, writing a column  in the paper and hosting a podcast about people's life's make you a journalist? 😂
I’d pay A weekly PPV to see Snr talk every Saturday night for an hour. The man has charisma beyond what’s possible in humans 😂
Simon is a very successful businessman and a great pundit of boxing 🥊 and eubank is so wrong
Simons face is a belter when eubank is talking 🥊🥊🥊🥊😂😂😂
The next interview will be live from Broadmoor.
Simon should clarify what he is then, I like Simon on talksport, he talks a lot of sense, but does at times seem to think he can have his cake and eat it  You have to admire Chris Eubanks love for his son
Oh dear
Love Simon and eubank snr👏👏 Talk Sport ist damn cool
Eubank is a man that likes to trade off his 'intelligence and knowledge' but there's so much he just doesn't get that even a man with average intelligence would. I actually think he's on the spectrum.
gwan eubanks lol
It means he can’t slag journalists because he is one of
"Don't point at me it's rude " seconds later points at Chris - Simon Jordan and his "morals" in  2024 😅
Eubank JR is his own man more so these days, he stepped away from his Dad, sorry Chris. Shocked to hear Jr is 13st+ he normally doesnt blow up that much
Chris Eubank is a professional Clown needs to stop smoking crack
Classic Murdoch Journalists backing Chris Eubank Sr into a corner, giving him no room to breathe.
Chris is right, his name is a good selling point, and he was a great cash cow. I think he should get a proper promoter, and not let Chris anywhere near his corner. Sure play the eubank card and sell him, but stay out of the business side. Chris jr wasted a lot of his career without a proper trainer, and loosing fight opportunities because of Sr.
Only 3 minutes in and this has just confirmed that eubank sr is a complete utter narcissist. “The only way you can beat him, is if daddy is there” absolutely full of himself and trying to take credit away from his son
7m13 Chris eubank turns into Ziggy Marley 😂
For someone so smug, Eubank doesnt have very strong maths skills.
Jim White is the new Lily Savage
Like Simon but he got owned 😂😂😂😂
"Don't point Chris, it's rude" Simon says after Chris stops pointing. Less than a minute later,  Simon is pointing. Did Simple Simon miss the Pieman on his way to the fair, or is it a case of Simon never said? 🤔
Hes a loose canon lol
Chris is one of the few people that has repeatedly schooled Simon 😂😂😂  Simon’s face after Chris’s journalist rant is absolutely priceless lol.
I love Eubanks snr , a boxer and intellect and a poet ❤
Delusion of grandeur.
Bring Chris bank snr In more often love seeing Simon getting it stuck on him
Chris and Simon,  two peas in a pod, they both talk over everyone with massive egos.
Chris has lost the plot
Simon 'Hater' Jordan
Rasta what?
Simon is a journalist! I’m confused why he’s saying he’s not lmao
How right is Senior
exploitation
Snr is gold. Simon absolutely rajin at being called a journalist 😂😂
Simon doesn't like it up em! 😂
Jordan is a joke
Spoiler alert: 😂 “the Boss” is Jah, Rastafari..
Whats going on with his son the wronger  😂😂😂 not jr 😂😂😂
Jordan the biggest goon going failed businessman at that
Mad as a box of frogs. Love him.
Eubank isn’t betting Canelo for me, he is overrated
Eubank is 100% correct about the fact his name brings the economics....he's box office
It’s hard to watch a legend being challenged by the hypocrite grand master that is Simon “I’m right” Jordan. Kneel and kiss the ring
I noticed this time round Simon and Jim were very careful with their language and approach to Chris. Wonder if it was because of the aftermath of the previous interview where Jnr and Hearn accused Simon and Jim of taking advantage of Snr.
I like Chris, but he's deluded. Narcissistic delusion. Honestly, I despair.
Funny Jim was holding up Jordans column in the Mail last week....He is a journalist!!!! 🤣
In my mind a pundit is an ex professional of that sport and knows the business a journalist is trying to find out how the business works and put a spin on it so yes simon you are a journalist 😂
Chris was extremely neglected as a kid and it shows as an adult.
Chris is so calm cause he knows he could drop Simon in 10 seconds
Simon is fuming and im all for it, actually like him so its good to see someone get that reaction out of him hahaha
Chris just destroyed Simon
Chris Eubank is hard to listen to. All about himself. Poor Junior.
Eubank is a proper burnout that loves the sound of his own voice.
Simon is a hater
He's right about Conor Benn, why these journos and promotors give Conor Benn airtime when he has acheived not that much but calls out Bud but fights Dobson ffs.
Old Harvey dent doesn't like been called a journalist. 😮
hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaa
CLASSIC TALKSPORT! TWO HUGE CHARACTERS AND JIM WHITE ADDING AND SITTING BACK TO WATCH THE FIREWORKS. I LAUGHED OUT LOUD THIS MORNING. GREAT WAY TO GET THROUGH A UK WINTER.
Jims face says it all
This will be another amir kahn kell brook situation 😂
sheriffs badge on it 🤣🤣🤣
of course your a journalist you talk our ears off every day for a living and interview PEOPLE for a living.. not to mention the columns where you give your opinions weekly.. hes a lemon sometimes.. " i dont need you   " talk sport will be crying and adam catterall will do another monologue if they end up banned from the eubank ben fight lol
"HE'S A JOURNALIST!!" 😲😂😂😂
This guys voice is hilarious 😂
Eubank Snr is a legend but personally i think he is damaging for either of his sons career. I think he needs therapy. Its a shame
10 - 7 round to Eubank vs Simon
EUBanks is an act and always has been 😂
Jordan is utterly clueless, but is able to trick people into thinking he knows what he's talking about just because he's well spoken and uses long and / or fancy words when he can.  Then again he's still better than the useless Agbonlahor, who's pretty dim (to put it generously), is uninformed and has no charisma to boot.
He clearly admitted to it, everything is about ME when it comes down to it. This man is a very fragile narcissist.
Simon talks gabbage. He says the Hallem vs Connor Benn fight doesnt make sense. Does the Connor vs Dubson fight make sense????????
Go on Simon ye legend
Chris has lost it 🤣🤣🤣
🥊💨 go on Chris 👌
Simon.... you're a journalist
Brilliant by Eubank, and jordan, very entertaining without people shouting and calling names.
You know it's a good interview, when Jim sits back and watches the fireworks 😂
I love this guy 😂
We love Eubank 😊
Simons Wikipedia needs updated journalist
Someone should keep Eubank away from interviews
I like Chris, he's a character, but God, he talks some nonsense.
Whatever you think of Chris, he is pure entertainment and he is most certainly what it says on the tin 😂
Sartorial Elegance
Have to disagree with Eubank Sr on this one, the public want to see 'Benn Vs Eubank Jr', not Harlem Eubank... and especially now after what happened
I think its disgusting media company's keep taking advantage of the mentally ill, Eubank is clearly disturbed.
Daddy Eubank don't half talk some shite.
I said it from day 1, Snr paid Benns doctor to spike him and put the clomophene in Benns system, which is why he said "100% the fight will not happen because i wont let it and ill do everything in my power to make sure it doesnt go ahead" and then hes basically just confirmed my suspicions by saying he can get him his lisence back wjth a click of his fingers, which would be by telling the truth and letting the world and bbboc know what he did. This is also the reason why hes said he 100% believes Benn didnt cheat. Its so obvious to me i dont get how the rest of the boxing world dont see it
Jordan doesn't want to be held accountable as a   journalist because then he would have to be   labeled as an amateur boxing/sports journalist   which takes the shine off this elite persona as a   tower of perfection which he has crafted on   talksport.   Mock him or laugh at him...Eubank is no fool
I love Chris Eubank SNR
Benn vs Harlem would be a good dust up. Benn has the speed and power but eubanks a skillful fighter. Defo wouldnt mind seeing this tbh
Simon, I can't believe Talksport give this guy airtime. Taken to many punches
Eubank is certi. What a legend.
So I suppose eubank owes his career to Steve Davis lol😂
He knows Connor absolutely obliterates his son
Chris finished him looool smug 🤡
Look at everything ETH had to solve. Ronaldo. Captaincy. Greenwood. Sancho. Emergency loans. Takeover. Rashford.
Love to get  ahold of the mushrooms Eubank is on
2:30 in and he has said "lets get to the point" 3 times...without getting to any point lol
Someone get them a tampon lol he got then strung up
Or You are deluded!!!  Quality!  Snr getting his own back. For when Simon insulted his son last interview 👍👍👍
He got to both of them lol
I wish I could find Chris's dealer
No idea why Chris is wearing a sheriff badge but the hustle is amusing
Chris is right..  Harlem v Druggy is a good fight, as Harlem is excellent hence why they avoid him..  Benns fighting a easy one yet again and only calls Eubanks for the money to get more drugs i guess the druggy cheater..
Simon Journo.. not Jordan... tut! 🤣
Simon hating that he can't get a word in
I love simon on this one, ebank cant let go man lol
Wish Chris would have given a swift back hander to Simon.
Eubank is crazy however very very intelligent and simon jordan can see that and he flapped it
😂😂😂😂😂😂 can't get any better.
Simon jordan is a journalist. Simple as that. He's never boxed and hasn't got a clue about the sport. He's a joke. He thinks he knows everything. Cant stand him
Chris...."my surrogate son" ?
whats that star on his jacket, is he a sheriff? LOL
Jim White is creepy 😳
Chris Eubank Sr is comedy gold!
Simon the journo 🤣
This guy is a joke he somehow made his coke head son a big name and now he's trying to get some distant relative to that level. Talent is not hereditary
Undeniable that Eubank snr was one of BRITAINS best boxers, but he is bit tiring.
Dont point Simon
ABSOLUTE BOX OFFICE LOVE YOU CHRIS ❤❤❤
Chris is right about SJ
Someone is finally putting this annoying, highfalutin Simon in his place. Man thinks he knows better than everyone on the show... Never let him near the administration of anything related to football.
Jim White calls himself a journalist 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣bless
Eubank what a man.
10 until 1 is the highlight of my day. I couldn’t work without these two. Definitely helps with my mental health having Talksport in my life 👍🏻
In Nigel's bens tearms another Gomez Lopez hahaha
Eubank is such good fun! 😂
Who’s the Daddy it’s clearly Mr Chris Eubanks , brilliant 👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾👌🏾😀👍🏾
He is a Sh!t journalist at that !!!!!
Eubank was in full effect and had Simon on the ropes 😂 Simon getting called a journo really hits him hard, his words say otherwise but his face tells a different story
Brilliant chris....love the way he puts Simon in his place..
Simon blowing smoke up peoples rears.  He is in fact in journalism, therefore he is a journalist. It’s no biggie Simon
Simon lost me with the journalist thing he’s most definitely now a journalist 😂
Simon 2-Sides Journalist 😂😂😂
Wot an embarrassment to have the title FATHER i do feel for JNR to have endured a childhood under SNR REIGN
Phenomenal content watching Jordan be told he is in fact the person who asks the questions, and not who gets asked - never seen anyone so bitter as to how his expected life unfolded
Mad as a box of frog's 🐸 🐸 🐸 🐸
Absolutely brilliant had me in stitches well done
Spoken like a true journo!!!! And white get out his ass ffs it’s hard to watch
The only way to deal with this is put them both in the ring…. Now that’s ppv
Chris Euwank is most deluded person in Boxing followed closely by Chris Euwank Jr. God knows who this harlem fella is tho
Eubank is a clown and people that say he’s right in this argument are clearly gone with the wind too
Eubank has it all wrong. Simon is a disc jockey, not a journalist 😂
Gwarn Eubank . Put Jordan in his place Rasta 😂
Chris is absolutely spot on here about his son and also about Conor Benn. Hard truths
Brain damage at its finest
I was having a bad day until I watched this 😂😂😂😂
Guy legend,Simon bloody hard work on times,eubank take is ed off
This two are gold 😂😂😂😂
Simon is a journalist but jeez Chris  is one crazy cat.
I like simon hes grown on me for giving frank warren and eddie hearn some s*it but come on mate... you couldnt be more of a journalist if you tried 🤣
Chris has a identity crisis man 😂 bro switches from the queens English to the patios at the snap of a finger
SJ is a wannabe boxer/promoter - if he is not a jouranlist then what is he?
Always reverts back to snr.  As much as I love the guy,   He’s that guy you never tell a secret to. He’ll tell all 😂
Simon, you're a journalist
Eubank is so delusional,jr doesn’t deserve the pay day of canelo and would get mashed if it happened and Harlem isn’t in Benn’s league.Harlem is a channel 5 fighter on free tv there’s no hope people will pay to watch him at this point in his career
Eubank Snr is pure gold and deserves every penny he's earned
*NEWSFLASH* Chris Eubank, Deputy Sherriff for some county in Louisiana, says "It's all about me!"  This reminds me of Katie Price telling Peter Andre "You're nothing without me!" shortly before Andre dumped her for a mentally stable woman. Now I know why Eubank Jr dumped him as a promoter.
He a deluded genius. And he box office
In the clash of the egos Chris came out on top and neither took a backward step.
According to Wikipedia: Simon Jordan is an English businessman and presenter. So there. LOL.
Wow Jr. was walking around at 172 lbs the last time Sr. was in studio, and now he's at 187 lbs?  That's a lot of KFC.
Sr makin it so obvious he only wants Jr to fight Canelo to be in his cornee for a big paycheck 🤣
Chris is obviously right, Simon Jordan is a bit of a narcissist
Eubank Sr. positioning Jr. for a Canelo fight.  Goodness gracious couldn't even get a fight with GGG in the day.
🥥 euwank with his blue peters badge on.
Weirdo
I think Boxxer needs to get Euba k Sr to work as a promoter!British boxing needs Eubank Sr in the center be it promotion or punditry!I Can imagine Eubank doing match making for fights! Britain better utilise  our national treasures before Saudi it America grab them and use them to promote fights!
Chris having Simon up here and he doesn't like it 😂
Simon is a textbook journalist.
"He paid me money to come to a studio and sit down and have an interview...HE'S A JOURNALIST!" 😂😂😂
Simon Jordan is just Katie Hopkins with a minimal knowledge of boxing
I'm not talking about Robert Smith 🤣😭
Sheriff Eubank rolls into town!
Nobody in the world loves the sound of their own voice more than Chris Eubank Snr
Eubank snr is so self centred its a joke
Journalist: ​a person whose job is to collect and write news stories for newspapers, magazines, radio, television or online news sites  - Oxford English Dictionary
As a jamaican I am insulted with him spouting patois to the gents in the studio and loved how Simon just "whatever-ed" him. I suspect Chris is looking for a VIP at the Bob Marley movie launch
Jim does the reporting, Simon gives opinions on sports.
Eubant eubillient in his own self importance and full of manure as usual. Trying to fastrack Harlem up the  rankings you have to admire the hustle
Simon IS A JOURNALIST!! 😂😂😂
Eubank JNR wouldnt get any praise for winning with his dad behind him as he'd end up wanting all the credit. Its hard to ascertain who has the bigger Ego between him and Jordan. Probably a draw!!!
Car crash
Never trust a journo
Snr. Is the gift that keeps on giving 😂
U should not have a person with his mental health
He's drifting in and out of sense and insanity
Simon is a journalist/critic, but CE snr has been smoking some of rasta woodbine, and I was a big fan in the 90's.
13:15 Beautiful 😂😂😂🤣😭
Simon vs Eubank boxing match
Simon is making money from talking about other people accomplishments, and failures, so he’s a journalist. Serious businessman, should not concern himself if Eric Ten  Hag should be Manchester United manager.
I cant work out if Eubanks level of narcissism makes him a vulnerable adult or a unique individual who should be cherrished
Why is eubank Sr so petrified of conor Benn?
The thing is though he can get down to 160. If he’s 187 then he’s overweight at the moment
I love how much Simon is always in awe of Eubank whenever he walks into the room.
What a nob Jordan is
Listening to this live I was both pissing myself laughing but also concerned for Chris's mental health... Seriously, they should maybe stop giving him airtime and suggest he gets some help. And I'm saying that as a fan of Chris.
Chris eubank never fails to amaze me
Chris needs to be on here more often, this is gold
Chris looks so smart in his garms very stylish
Jordan can't fk with Eubank,no freaky.
Eubank thinks Simon is a journalist, eddie hearn thinks Simon is a disc jockey.. does anyone know what Simon actually is???
Eubank sr is deluded, complete BS from him
Chris is national treasure 😂. How can Simon deny that he’s a journalist lol
LOVE CHRIS SNR . WHAT A LEGEND
27 pounds is not that much to lose for boxer.  I dunno.  You just fast.  do not eat.   Dr Jamnadas.  stuff.   so I think he could make the weight if they were paying good money.  Calzaghe probably was 14 stone,  and went to 12 stone alot.
He is a journalist 😅
Chris is hilarious man god protect the sheriff
Sir Simon = Top LAD Proper Clobber ✊ 💯 Facts
Eubank says benn shouldn’t call out Crawford just after saying jnr v canelo and acting as if he would win with him in corner when he was dreadful whenever he was in corner - then says Harlem could beat Benn and rake over works when neither of that level and Harlem 19-0 and not fought anybody
He’s got more front than Brighton that Eubank🙈 off his rocker
Chris Eubank straight facts!
i put it to you.."YOU ARE A JOURNALIST"...eubank snr
Chris the legend senior is spot on im affraid. 🤷🏼‍♂️😎
Simon is in his feelings. 😂
Jesus 😂😂😂😂😂 this was entertainment!!
Great,to see Chris doing well
Simón is put in his place
😂😂😂😂😂
This is why Hearn wiped the floor with Jordan .. talkSPORT is the only sports channel that believes failed football club owners make boxing experts
Ahahah Simon got his arsenal handed to him
absolute comedy gold hahahahaha
7:09 when you're enjoying your meal and suddenly taste jerk sauce
Spot on Chris .. a failed football club owner doesn’t make you a boxing expert .. it’s talkSPORT at the end so it’s comedy gold
He’s gone, I’ve never heard so much bull 💩 in my life
What an infuriating man.  Eubank, not Simon.
this was like watching the office. comedy gold
Chris is becoming more ridiculous by the week. I used to like him a lot but his fabricated persona and pseudo intellectual twaddle is just boring now. It's easier to see why Chris junior perhaps distance himself too.  Conor Benn is on a totally different level to Harlem - Chris is sending his nephew into dangerous waters. Benn will batter him.  Fair play and credit for Simon too. He stood his ground and wasn't going to be intimidated.
😂😂😂😂😂
"You talk out of two sides of your face" 🤣
I love the Eubanks!!!
Conor Benn just comes across as a bitter thug and a cocky little roadman. Never going to reach half the heights of his legendary dad. Hasn't even cleared his name and all the while he's fighting nobodies.  My take? He doesn't even deserve the fight with Eubank Jr. Not in the current state of things. He should be humble until he's vindicated his name, not cantankerous and truculent like he's the king of the castle.  Perhaps he'll return to painting and decorating soon.
Benn absolutely batters harlem
It’s all games there all friends remember Eubank daughter is engaged with Eddies number 2 frank smith
Harlem is 19 fights undefeated! Isn't dobson 16 fights undefeated so what's the difference...
Jr needs to fight canelo for credibility. And can only beat him with his dad in his corner.  Wow. Chris Eubank Sr is an absolute legend of British boxing, an all time great of the sport.   But his ego is outrageous
Eubank is a complete melt. 😂
Eubank snr spiked Connor benn
WHY HAS CHRIS STARTED TALIKING JAMAICAN ? BEFORE HE WAS ENGLISH ....NOW HES A SHERIFF ....???? WHAT HE NEXT WEEK ? .....GHANDI  ?????? OR JESUS ???  THE MAN IS A CRACK HEAD
His naughty laughs to himself 😂
Someone shut Simon up-brilliant
He loves the power he has over junior lol
Eddie Hearn destroyed Simon’s appeal. Now whenever I see Simon on screen I scroll past until today, now Eubank Snr has owned him again. Simon is finished 😂
the most delusional man in boxing. Cringing so much at Eubank right now 🤣🤣🤣
Fair play to Simon for not backing down though, but he’s still a journalist 😂
How can you not love Chris Eubank, priceless entertainment!
Chris has lost the plot completely
Why cant Simon admit hes a journalist why is he so egotistic
SIMON IS A MASSIVE JOURNALIST 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can listen to Chris talk all day, love the man
bohhh bexcellent!!
Simon and Eubank need their own show, these 2 hilarious together.
the sheriff badge Chris is the law on boxing and Simon just a jack of all trades small amount of knowledge on many sports
Chris is talking out of his backside about Chris Jr
Jordan is one of the few who calls out Sr for the constant shite he comes out with.
Id watch Harlem vs Henn 😂
Snr, "the network" sometimes goes 😂
Jordan actually regularly writes articles for the Mail online. Is that not the definition of a journalist?! 😂 What is Simon like 😅
His name is Eubank for all you mongs in the comments who refer to him at this present moment as Eubanks.
The day Chris actually realises that people are just laughing at him the better, because putting him in front of someone like Simon Jordan is just embarrassing.  Great entertainment at the same time 😂.
Haha dont point simon
Rastafari
Absolutely love Simon and Chris hahaha, genuinely pissing myself the last few minutes of this
Journo
No chance Chris jr is 185 lbs. he looked just fine against Liam at 160 lbs. I’ll give it to Sr, he’s a great salesman
Simon is right. Harlem is a nobody. Most causals would have never even heard of him. Snr is deluded if he thinks Harlem is going to be headlining a big show anytime soon. And Chris being his promoter doesn't raise is profile significantly.
This is EPIC!😂
And that’s the bottom line, because the sheriff said so.
"Simon's role in boxing" 😂😂😂😂😂
a person who writes for newspapers, magazines, or news websites or prepares news to be broadcast. SIMOM YOU A JOURNALIST 😅😅
Hes bonkers, people only know him now as a meme.  Get over yourself.
Eubank Snr is just as controversial as he was as a boxer. 🤣 he will always have 50% for him and 50% against him
Eubank snr  literally gets weirder with every interview.
I make eubank totally right on all counts harlem v Benn does sell if senior is involved and Simon is now definitely a journalist 🙅🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
"Don't point your finger at me Chris that's rude!" Goes on to repeatedly point his finger at Chris. 🤔
Simon jordan deserves Sr.
Jim is literally having a ball. Eubank is hilarious! 🤣
Connor benn gets way more money for Harlem than he does for that guy he’s fighting at the weekend👍🏼How can the economics be there for that fight and not the harlem fight when the Harlem fight is bigger👍🏼
Absolutely love eubank snr 😂
Senior is TOP G
He's worse than john trying to live through their sons 😂😂 its sad state to see dads disrespecting their family
Hold on hold on Let me just talk over you for a sec again Hold on Let’s have it right  No let me speak I’ve had 6 Ferraris
When is he gunna be in a meaningful fight? You mad you been screaming how he shouldn’t fight
Definition of journalist- a person who writes for newspapers, magazines, or news websites or prepares news to be broadcast. So he’s not wrong 😂
Snr never fails to crack me up, the last 5 minutes 😂😂😂
Eubank the omnipotent, the second coming able to part the red sea and turn water into wine as long as his name is on the bottle..we have to consider the possibility that the universe was created by eubank Sr as part of his majesties grand design..
People can complain and moan about Snr but no one can argue that he’s not box office entertainment 😂
"The only way you can beat Canelo is if Daddy is next to you" Chris has a way of expressing massive love and belief in his son in the most narcissistic way I've ever encountered. 🤣  It's like saying "I love and respect you son, you can achieve ANYTHING in this world, but only because I was your Dad and the decisions I made for you, and just remember, even though you can achieve greatness you'll NEVER be greater than me!"
What's all this rastafaraeee!! business😂
Chris seems to be having a lot of trouble stringing together words to make a coherent sentence lol
Simon IS a journalist.
Chris Eubank is the 🐐
Pmsl Eubank is class
Rastafari
Why does he have so much hatred for his son?
Harlem is a terrestrial TV fighter. That doesn't bring enough money. Same with Josh Kelly. He's a terrestrial TV fighter too. Benn Eubank Jr will happen if the money is right. Eubank Jr is not interested in being world champion. Certainly not at 168 fighting Canelo.
Simon your a journalist lad
If you ever needed more evidence that Chris is a crack pot, look no further.
Feel for Harlem, he’s the vessel of which this narcissist is attempting to stay relevant with.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 classic, always stands out does Sr.
I don’t like Simon but this man’s ego is absolutely insufferable. Nobody likes a braggart and that’s all he does
Again with the Conor Benn talk.... Tell me why these journalists are making so much hype and talking about Conor Benn, I don't get it. Is it because his Dad who was a former champion is Nigel Benn, is that it? So what? means nothing, he's not Nigel. Or is it his padded record against guys I've never heard of with a less than impressive 14 ko's from 21 wins is what supposed to be the "Wow! Conor Benn!" selling point?   I don't want to be hating on the guy unfairly because he's not really established or had that big name fight yet, and I have nothing against, this is more at the media tbh who keep harping on about the guy like he's the next best thing since Floyd Mayweather, and for what? The guy was supposed to fight another former champions son who himself is not a champion either, Chris Eubank Jr, and he failed a drugs test before that happened. So... reel it in guys, he ain't proven shht yet, so stop bigging him up like he's won world titles and beaten top names, he ain't done either. If and when he does actually achieve that, then talk about him in those ways.
Sr "ME ME ME ME ME'"
I f ing love Eubank 💙🤣🤣🤣
Love it when he suddenly decides he’s Jamaican 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The term Delusions of Grandeur perfectly fits Eubank Snr, the guys a flaming ego maniac 😭 makes for very good tv though lol
Great boxer in his day but stone cold bonkers now. Cant even articulate a sentence. Who does he think he is
You look pon him right here 😂😂😂
Why does Simon always try to control every topic of conversation lol? How many fields can he be expert in.
No matter what I’m sure we can agree that senior is a legend
Chris has lost the plot, ITV lost millions on him. He has tried promoting for years and has bankrupted multiple promotional firms.
Imagine all the clowns in the comments laughing at snr hes the one going off air and laughing the whole way to the bank lol
Chris Eubank you gotta love him
Rasta, I smoke ganja
Eubanks talking shite again
As much as I think Simon is a decent journalist, that is exactly what he is, just another hack
Chris said he would stop the fight! He did. He said he knows the man! Who’s the man? And lastly he said he alone can get Benns license back! That’s very worrying 🤬🤐🥊
Eubank Sr is genuinely insane
My dad lost his son my 26 yr old I turned pro bkb I was on drugs Nd using ,, ppv last year senior god bless plus I rap our channel is positive god bless bobby k Scotland Dundee
Can’t stand Simon
Good old Connor "Eggs" Benn 😂
SIMON IS AN EFFIN' JOURNO!
Eubank for the riddler in the next batman movie? I can't stand listening to the guy anymore.
Lol Chris was well triggered at the end.
That was funny 😂
Sr is correct...the Liam Smith win for his son was pointless. Junior has spent his career losing to his best opponents and beating, at best, B level opponents.
31 turned pro then I’ve Been mentioned on ufc bobby k from Dundee Scotland Britain
Eubank Sr will argue with Siri if you let him!
Please stop bringing him on for his own sake, he’s a legend who is mentally unstable. Stop allowing this.
Chris Eubank run out of money and is looking for another payday. Thank God junior left him. Can get Conor Benn relicensed in the UK with BBBOC because he knows the TOP Man ? Crazy. Both Jim and Simon are laughing at him and sad to see. Harlem cannot sell a fight with anyone even with Chris by his side hence why they want Conor. Love to hear what Nigel has to say !
11:06 "Don't point Chris thats rude" 12:14 *points at Chris" SJ is the biggest hypocrite on TS , and thats just 1 example of so so many...
That guy is a weird dude
Harlem would beat Ben sub to my channel I turned pro was on paperview last year bkb pro I’m an ex addict lost my brother last yr 26 old I’m fighting soon
Eubank Just came on to promote his other son - his surrogate son. 😂Excellent work😂
Heads gone but I do agree with what he says about Benn. Calling out boots Ennis Crawford and that talking like he’s a world conquerer but all he’s really done is bang out a washed up algeri and others of the sort. Calls out pacquiao ten years passed hes best and Kell brook. Make ur mind up. Make it make sense
This is brilliant never seen Simon so rattled
Used to respect Chris senior but what a sad state of affairs. Nobody wants Harlem v Conor the nephew vs the son doesn’t quite have the same ring as son vs son
07:10 😂😂😂
Simon Jordan was finding it very hard to not burst out laughing 😆
Eubank is batshit crazy but so, so entertaining.
Christ Simon is so damn defensive. Embarrassing for a journalist to act like this 😏
So according to Eubank SR, Eubank JR will never fight at 160 ever again?
Talksport credibility is down the pan now 😂😂😂😂
Benn v Harlem is a bigger mismatch than Chris Eubank v benn I think personally
This guy is not okey
Chris is losing it 🤭
Canelo 😂😂
Haha Simon doesnt have a role in boxing any more than any other casual commentator...
Simon knows the most about boxing 🤔he does in me feck the people that were in the ring knows the most
Simon hates the FACT he’s a journalist!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t encourage this guy he is clearly mentally ill . All he does is fame vampire off his children careers
Always all about Chris Sr.. Jr wanted to carve out his own career away from him and then basically Sr has disowned him. Now picked up the cousin as his protégé to stay in the public eye and stating Harlem is his real adopted son... This is sad and bitter.
Chris is right. You report on sports news. You are a journalist.
Love him
This is really uncomfortable to watch Chris seems all over the place
8:40 absolutely BRILLIANT 🤣🤣🤣
The Journalist vs The Sheriff on the next undercard 🥊 ⭐️
Best of interviews  👌
8:41 He's talking about the Mason's.. boxing like everything else is run by the masons.. why do you think his son is always pictured doung the shush (finger over the lips) sign after every fight.. Masonic vow of silence.. they're all in it at some level.. to get anywhere you gotta partake in the club..
Would Harlem fight Adam Azim or Doltan Smith???
Eubank Jr 🥊👍 Good Fighter
Eubanks says a lot without saying a lot 🥴 legendary fighter no doubt but much that comes out of his mouth is outdated and just nonsense!! Harlem Eubank? Harlem vs Crawford? 😆
Simon is clearly involved with Boxxer
Jesus I love Senior but he needs to step aside from self promoting. It's all Me to point of his sons are just the side story. He'd get more respect for being subtle now and not the sheriff of his own town
I know the boss...corruption through and through 😂😂
Simon Jordan has become a joke since Eddie pulled his pants down
“Excellent, wonderful, thank you, rastafari, reach, dreadlocks”
Take that stupid Sheriff badge off. Stop putting this clown on the show.
Eu bank Snr can talk Yano a man keep saying hold lmao Harlem is trash, eu bank overrated got no beasts won’t win won.
Canelo is never fighting Jr. he won’t even fight David benavidez who deserves it
Harlem would beat the breaks off Benn
😂😂😂 brain damaged
Simon is just a clickbait journalist
Simon Jordan is a journalist and a clickbait puppet for Rupert Murdoch at Talksport. Absolute bad waffler!
Eubank would dismantle the disc jockey simon
