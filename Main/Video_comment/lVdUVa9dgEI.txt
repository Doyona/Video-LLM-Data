These animations are so unhinged 💀
Diary of a wimpy kid nerd alert! Erm-Actually it’s that the fire fighters were out of water and they needed Greg to put out the fire and he was drinking a big gulp.
I’ve had the exact same zombie apocalypse dream twice before, but in one, my family died, and in the other, I died… I woke up screaming and hyperventilating both times… turns out I just had covid
4:57  I don’t think he understands what atheism is …. Also I was not aware he was against religions that aren’t his….
One weird ass dream that I had:  So, before this dream I had a dream about Skyrim and I paused this quest about exploring a mine with poisonous gas. There was already another group who had left during a cutscene and I had to lead the other group. I paused the quest though, and the rest of my dream was in Skyrim. In tonights dream I found the same quest as I left it in the past dream, but I had to do it. Like, I was forced into it somehow and they started following me and I couldn’t get them to just stay somewhere. So we went into the mine and, long story short, we found a giant maze and the other group was on the opposite side. Even though there was no way out of the infinite maze, because it was a bunch of circles inside a rectangle, we jumped in. Then I turned into Percy Jackson(???) and instead of Sally being Percy’s mom it was Spiderman’s Aunt May. Then there was a cutscene of Steve’s Minecraft house falling into a mountain (which I guess is supposed to show how the maze was formed?). We somehow found an exit on top of the maze and got to it, and then we were on a m mountain top and I was trying to save Aunt May from falling of a cliff, but then she said she was poisoned and let go and I guess she died. Afterward, I was at an improvised wedding for Percy and Annabeth (I was still Percy) and we both had rings for each other, although they were both huge. Annabeth gave Percy a gold ring with a giant ruby in the middle and diamonds around it. Percy gave Annabeth a silver ring with a huge grayish diamond in the middle and opal around it. I am so freaking confused right now!!!
I know this was three years ago, but I really hope there'll be another one with even more animators
Ayo
why is there yaoi in this video
13:41
when I was a kid, I remember having a dream of W. D. Gaster(undertale) running after me, in my apartment. and as soon as I woke up, I literally felt some kind of a sensation on my back, as if he had touched me there in a dream.
Play 0:10 at .25 speed💀💀

7:02  *forshadowing 2025 w/ ICE*
I once had a dream (sleep paralysis? hallucination?) where there was a very tall, thin, pitch black figure sitting at the end of my bed. I'd wake up and check the time, it would start making passive aggressive comments about when I was planning to get up, and I'd argue with it, then fall asleep again every 15ish minutes for I kid you not 3 hours.
James X maaz
Checkmat aethist just cracked my tf up
0:36 👀
Also why are Maaz and James sleeping together I thot that Maaz just got married to name is he already cheating on her for James? Maaz that’s even low for you and James you know better than to sleep with another guy. Then again I couldn’t blame you two for sleeping together you guy seem like the ultimate ship LOL.
Last Friday I woke up at 7;40 to get ready for school and the only two worlds I was thinking of from the night before were furrys and booze the most I can remember from that night before was me stay up till 4:00 in the morning because I couldn’t sleep.
10:48 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THIS IS LITERALLY THE SAME DREAM I WOULD HAVE EVERY TIME I HAD WET THE BED UNTIL I JUST STOPPED HAVING THEM
10:28  I have bladder problems so I still wet the bed like once every year
Actually I seem to have had all of these dreams
Same with the dragon dream except I was there for longer
I kinda feel bad for wetmonsoon, every living being is gonna skip his part

This is one of my dreams that a wrote down:  Coming into this orphanage type place for keeping kids (it’s also like a wild life reserve, but for kids to wander around)! On the way in I meet a German shepherd who seems really mean, but I share my pickles with him and he seems nicer! Later, I’m walking through the forest and some guy who teamed up with spiders scoops me up into his cabbage leaf hanging house and offers to team up and live with him, but I say no, since I have my own base! After he puts me down, I notice his webbing art, and suggest that he use the paint tool to make them more visible so people don’t walk into them! Later, people trying to hunt me down (for some reason) are going up against me and the other kids backing my side, and I’m running towards the corner of the map, about to run out of space, but I jump off and land on the rim, running back towards the house! On the way, some girl on my team meets up with me and reveals her ‘escape under beds’ card! So I start crawling between the bed layers (which are WAY too small for me to fit between) but notice she is just running, so I break out and run towards the forest spot where spider dude and I made base (I had made my base in a nearby spot) and said hi to his bird that he drew and I gave a lucky charm! (At some point, I’m loosing my memory of it!) but the manager came out of a portapotty while we were in the bed house and noticed me, so the guys start chasing us again, and we have to escape! I try to use the paint tool to give myself wings, but open another app instead and woke up!  So ya, pretty weird! Let me know if you want another, I guess?
no
Maazes first story is me beating up my brother for no reason at all😂
There are sadly such thing as flying cockroaches.
0:35 OM MY SPLLOGY DOOGY
That egg shadow is a legend
hey maaz one of the npcs in genshin impact have my name and its Niwa like bruh i guess i'm in the game and im not even joking
I got an ad at 3:02  Roght before he said what it was.
For me, every single dream is a lucid dream. I am somehow able to choose what i do in the dream and i know full well that im in one, and i continue to do the most craziest sh!t. But if its like a nightmare, i can automatically escape it. I know how to escape my dreams. Its kinda hard tho and the difficulty depends on how scary or intense the nightmare is.
Anyone realise Mr.Crocker? 7:15
Once, I had a nightmare. Everyone was brought to a new city while they were sleeping. This city was made to be environmental friendly and all shared. So shared bathrooms, shared showers, shared everything. No cars, nothing. Not too bad right? Well the other thing, everyone was naked and there were no clothes. But you had to walk everywhere to get things. Like half the villege to get to the toilet, then half the village to get food. All naked, all day...  I woke up like "no, this can never happen, I won't go through it".
One of the dragons looks like fwench fwy
0:45   UUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHH-
8:26  I cant stop 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 laughin

Good luck
Theodd1out likes furrys and isn't afraidt
My dream: Killer Sans was a chef and this one line ‘soul infused water, profit’ *Confusion *
Dude I have dreams from like a year ago that I wrote down and I was so just weird…
*its time to get up its time to get up its time to get up in the morning*
"A world filled with elemental magic" and "A traveler who came from a different world using magic" right after the Genshin sponsorship is crazy
I don't know where, but I swear to God that I've heard that 'it's time to get up' song. I don't know when I don't know where, All I know is that I've heard that song before.
It's telling you to read Wings Of Fire
Bro the dream with the monters bro i had the same dream bro i reamber it so vividly
I love how James is just flirting with Maaz in the middle of the comment section

“ITS TIME TO GET ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNINNN, ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP TODAY- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA, HAHAHAHAHAHAAA”
I will be in the furry prison
This will probably be buried in the comments, but  Middle school: how I survived bullies, broccoli, and snake Hill (by James Patterson)   Page 51 in the illustration on the bottom there is a horn telling the camp “ you’ve gotta get up, You’ve gotta get up, You’ve gotta get up in the moooorning!” I think this is the origin of what you dreamed.
I only have Lucid dreams never had a normal one before
If you and let me explain studios had a kid,it would either have a normal face,or no face
I already have it and i love it
I oce had a dream I was eating my friends dog and when someone asked why I said it tasted like vanilla cake😅
i had a dream like maaz  did
13:41 NAH💀 YOUR GOING INSANE BY THAT POINT
Without a doubt, the weirdest dream I’ve had (which happened last night at the time I’m writing this) I dreamt there was two bear cubs in my backyard on a tree, then some dude dressed as the grinch just walk in my backyard and the mama bear attacked him. In my dream, I called 911 and when the mama bear and her cubs ran away, I ran out to see if the guy with the grinch costume was ok, only the find out we was totally fine! And he literally walked away without a scratch on him! 😂😂😂😂😂

Why do you all have really good artstyles
I had a dream where I had a praying mantis instead of a chicken I want a giant robot as a house
wait u didnt know cockroaches coudl fly? YOU HAD A DREAM AND IT COULDVE BEEN REAL AND U HAD NO IDEA huh
I have a note in my notes app on my phone called "My Dreams" and I write all my weird, cool and sad dreams I can describe (some are so weird I can't) I currently have like 15 dreams written there and 2 on my old phone and some still in my memory.  Btw maybe in December during winter break I had a dream that I was in my room and playing fnaf (irl) with my duck plushies and a freddy mask and a path that I had to walk on. After a while my mom and some man (we knew him in the dream, he kinda looked like my cousin) came in and we wanted to play some Minecraft board game with him. *Then after a while my dad came in, he was mad and he just threw a granade at me.* The sound was so loud it woke me up and shook me a bit and I didn't go to sleep again. (But it was already 12pm.)  And I had 2 dreams about 2 different movies that didn't exist... I WANT THEM TO EXIST!! 😭
4:28 is really good. It would look absolutely phenomenal if it had colour and wasnt just lines. Still really impressive
Your dreams are COHESIVE?
Dragon prison is how to train a dragon lol

3:08 Hi there! The ad ends at 4:25 :)
I once had a dream about being on a blizzard planet. I was in a random train station with like 1000 penguins. I left the train station and there were these black hands from the ground that tried grabbing me.
0:21 I think we all saw how annoyed the judge was here-

PARTYDAVE COOKED MY WHOLE HOUSE

A weird dream cracked my egg and turned me non binary
When you dream about Lovecraft horror you don't want to remember what was going on and when it's not Lovecraft horror it's just me casually watching someone put up a Dyson sphere weird shit
I dreamed that i was chased by a creepy doll. and the doll put me on the ground. and then he ate me...
This video was 2✌!!! years ago
6:05 bruh is this just a plug for genshin or an actual dream?

I'd rather not try to remember all my dreams.  I had one about a young girl getting murdered because she witnessed a murder and her younger brother finding her detached arm. Sooo I try not to dwell too much on dreams.
lol
Sus odd1s 3:55
i had a dream that a baby bee dragon with 4 wings was biting my left big toe at 3 am.
The second dream of James is suspiciously similar to the Despiclable Me 4 movie meeting.
3:04 I CANT ESCAPE IT I KKOW- I NEED TO DO MY DAILIES 😭😭💔💔

You don't?
If my villain was shot with the ray to make them the perfect villain he would want to A: be stronger B: have legs cause he only floats cause his legs got cut off C: more smart. And dragon prison was cool
Sleep paralysis flumpty, Sleep paralysis flumpty, Sleep paralysis flumpty,
How could you like genshin maaz..
What about when my brother had a dream where a gnome came in and replaced everyone's chin with a pencil sharpener
Who’s the dream I said so there was a big meeting. There was like a big weird scary guy. And he told everybody that kids are the food source and you can’t grow up so either you’re born as a kid or you’re born as an adult and I was born as a kid. My dad was standing right next to me and there’s fireworks going off in the background and I asked him you would never do that right and then he kind of like fake Lee said sure so then we go down to this underground place and I say look daddy there’s a little Ferris wheel over there and he says OK let me just do something first and we go to a meat grinder and he picks me up and runs me through and then the meat falls on the floor and the dream ends
AQUAMAN
0:44 Maaz WHAT THE-
i am subscarbed now
I once had a dream of the inevitability of the death of the earth.                                                        0:00

The talking egg probably has ADHD
Manray should be proud
When they said ray it's a mantaray
Is it strange to not have dreams? I have dreams, but not super frequently. Maybe once or twice a year? It’s not frequent enough to have ever considered having a dream journal. My dreams have also gotten less frequent in the last couple years. Like during early middle school I would have dreams maybe 4 or 5 times a year. But now I am currently on track for no dreams for 2024
Hey, yo, what the #### 0:40
0:44 : explain yourself maaz
MR CROCKER?!?!
Once I had a dream when I was a kid—It was about me JUMPING OFF A PLANE into a huge lake with two friends from this game called Animal Jam. It was actually kind of fun. I got to ‘see’ the city of London as I was jumping. There were cool buildings and parks, and the lake had beautiful islands and a few torrents giving to the water supply. I saw someone walking a long-furred Yorkshire Terrier with a pink leash.
Every single dream I’ve had has been crazy as these 😂
i havent had a dream in two years
Roaches can fly.
I don't normally remember dreams unless it's a nightmare so here's one I remember vividly!  You awake in an empty room, nothing but the bed in the middle of this circle room which you were sitting on, suddenly you hear screaming and a woman runs into your room "*your name* there's a flood!" The woman would say in a panic before running back down the stairs. You run to the window and see a flood of water coming your way and the woman running from it. You rush outside and start trying to run away but gravity seems to get heavier. You start jumping to desperately get away but nothing works. Moments before the water submerges you, you wake up.
i cant haddle james laugh...
In the "smaller villains" there should of need bill cipher!!!!
:)
As a furry, due to our tax evasion I can confirm there is a furry prison
I LOVE genshin inpact!
Last night I had 3 dreams in one. Here are each of them (WARNING: super strange) 1. I was watching a video where Flamingo and his friends played some Roblox game where they were a royal chicken family that could fly for some reason and they’d go to the dance every night and it ended when the mom/queen (I think it was Kaden) was making royal pancakes 2. I was at a school that had a zoo outside and for recess we got to go see the animals but for some reason there would be oddly chill bears walking around and octopi in with the I think it was mice or some other small rodent it ended during Art class 3. I was in my house alone with my Aunt and it suddenly caught on fire and 10 seconds later the fire went out with somehow no damage and I started grabbing all my things in case it was a warning and when I entered a room I would suddenly be so tired I could hardly keep my eyes open and everything was really hard to see so I just grabbed an entire mattress that was the weight of a blanket and it ended when I had my Nintendo switch and went to grab the charger (I don’t know where my parents, sister, and dogs were during all of this)
James YE
its time to wake up its time to wake up its time to wake up Ha ha hahahaha its time to wake up its time to wake up its time to wake up Ha ha hahahaha its time to wake up its time to wake up its time to wake up Ha ha hahahaha its time to wake up its time to wake up its time to wake up Ha ha hahahaha

0:54 krugston!?!?!?!
0:42 freaky dream 😴💭
the pot brownies.... what was james doing irl
All of my dream are like that, or even weirder💀
Here's a weird dream I had: so basically the dream started with me looking at a demon type thing I ran and then for some reason I started washing my hands in the kitchen sink then a person came and told me to go wash my hands in the bathroom I went into the washroom and some said in a very devilish voice:"maartaaa" again and again and then I woke up
Here’s a weird dream I wrote down; Starting out on a large ship flying through space towards a large ice and desert planet, I launch down on the icy side, then learn some context about what’s happened. There’s a large empire type thing that I, who is apparently a large general, gets exiled and I take my massive ship with me, and my crew with their family’s, and this planet has some answers for me. As I said I was in the ice and I wandered along, while my ship flew around trying to avoid the enemy fleets as we wanted and now they are hiding in asteroid belts. I'm wandering through the ice towards the desert lands climbing up and down icy cliffs through it to some ruins. The ruins have masked robotic/ almost cat-like fur people to survive in the cold, also there’s ice sharks and really big ice sea serpents. As I make it through the ruins fighting my way through I get to a large cliff and off in the distance I can see the desert. I make my way the rest of the way there and it's the day when I get there. As I travel through the rocky orange and gold desert I arrive at this large modern home with thick tarp protection systems for sandstorms. The family   helps me, in the night we are attacked and I kill them before they can kill us, the family thanked me and I wandered into the desert. Then after a bit came back They were very kind. (Not sure why I mentioned that) and then I woke up.
As soon as you wake up write aquaman
at the egg one i thought new creepypasta unlocked
00:36 is the lowkey the best frame of the whole video
Why do a sleeping animation when you DONT EVEN HAVE EYESSSSS( no hate tho )

This was SO cute to see all these different animation styles, and it was funny seeing James’s mouth move when he talked. 😂
0:44 UUUUHHHHMMM....
I remember my old dream , I had a nightmare and i was terrified , but I said f*ck it and somehow just go out of that dream , after that I had like a remote and i saw my nightmare like a thumbnail , and after that I was looking with a remote for good dream , and I found a blank dream , I clicked it with a remote and started making a dream with my mind , I tried not to think about scary things , but when I thought about a scary clown I got jump scared and woke up
I have multiple cockroaches... Help😢😢😢😢
Bro is that flumpty in the thumbnail! (Ik its not)
I love abnormal chaos’s art/animation
It sort of scares me that odd1sout mentions furries a LOT… almost like he is one….
1:41 any dragon puppeteirs? Any????
3:30 the charecters are what Maaz yoooo guys maaz has a thing for 200 year olds that looks like kids nahhhhhh
Ok so, that "perfect monster" story made me do a spit-take so intense I almost choked and also almost hit my head. Out of all the iconic minor villains in the that era of cartoons, the very last one I'd have even expected to be there, let alone the most displayed one in the very front, was Jack Spicer. I didn't think anyone even remembered Xiaolin Showdown even 5 years ago. I've just never heard anyone mention it at all since it stopped airing on TV! And, side note, absolutely love all the art, all the villains were perfect. But anyways, I was obsessed with Jack Spicer as a kid. I named one of my dogs in Nintendogs after him. I was absolutely captivated by him, and if I could go back and tell myself anything during that time, I'd say "Hey, little me. What you feel for Jack Spicer isn't a crush, it's called °｡⋆ ू ๑  Gender Envy  ๑ू ⋆ ｡ °... Oh and also don't try to cut your bangs in Jr High 6-8 years from now, your hair is way too curly for that and you'll feel like you've ruined the last 3 years of your life for doing it."
Maaz: domain expansion infinite ocean
i liked the start of the story board made by partydave it reminded me of the bfbfdi or bfb intro
When I write down my dreams it takes literally an hour because I have VERY long, VERY vivid dreams, and when I scroll down my journal app, it takes like 10 seconds to scroll down this one paragraph bc I wrote so much 😂
It's funny cuz I'm watching this two years later XD
How do I have more videos than you
DRAGONS LIKE FROM WINGS OF FIRE CUZ THAT CRYING ONE LOOKED LIKE QUEEN RUBY
I HAVE THE POWER
What villains were in the meeting, Garmadon from Ningago? Lore Voldemort from Harry Potter? Thanos from Infinity War? The Odd1sOut because he dreams of furry prson
my dreams look like like drug trips nothing makes sence and everything is super weird
i hate gesine impact
one of my dreams was that i was in my kitchen doing stuffs and i saw an alien doing a thing with it hands and i saw into space through in hand then my uncle came in and did the same thing but less magical
This video actually inspired me to write down my dreams. I started a few days after this video's release, and I've been writing them down ever since. It's really cool since I remember them all upon looking at them. Thank you for all that :)
I see an ace attorney reference right there
this is 2 years ago now too
Egg scary
0:44 the fanfics came true this day😂
DREAMS AER FUNNY, SILLY, WEIRD, AND SOMETIMES RANDOM AND COOL AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE RELATED TO SOMETHING IN REAL LIFE  OR....... ITS A NIGHTMARE, I DONT LIKE NIGHTMARES!!!!!!!
I loved Party Dave’s anime-esk animation style
I kept falling asleep during this video
BRO THE ALIEN DIDNT DO NOTHIN-
Flumpty is that you
Am I the only one who just has dreams of fandoms and nothing else? 😭 Either that or I just don’t sleep
I'm a dragon. I always have dreams about being cot by Hunters'
The dreams about peeing reminds me of when I was little when I was little, I had a babysitter and she would have us eat and then take a nap because she probably didn’t have enough time to take care of all of us at the same time when I was sleeping btw she’s babysitting at her house anyway, as I was sleeping on the couch I imagined I was going to the bathroom and I needed to go really bad so I peed i’m glad I didn’t get into any trouble though.😅

The all ones out is amazing
These dreams are surprisingly normal compared to the ones i have and expected
13:23 i believe james had whats called a waking nightmare. Its a nightmare similar to sleep paralysis but you can move and talk (your also asleep and not halfway awake)
Your a frog
WAIT the Oddsones1out  is... COMMENTING???
The egg thi g made me laugh so hard and I couldn't stop rewashing it
Jason: Weird dragon prison Maaz: Cringy isekai manga power fantasy James: Luigi is an evil monster with no legs Maaz: Normal encounter with a cockroach James: Sister ate improv group pot brownies Maaz: "Aquaman" James: Nightmare demon head revelry One of them had some pretty weird dreams, and one of them just played too much Genshin Impact, remembered something that actually happened to him, and left himself a note about a movie.
00:02 hi timed veiwers
I just noticed the price was 420 69
5:47 Bro is not quibble from msm
I like how when James says "Ray", he meant like a laser, but the artist made it a stingray lol
Okay listen listen, you don’t?
I like 3😊😊😊😊😊
You know what’s wried, the wried egg In the thumbnail, was in one of my nightmare’s when I was 7 which is scary 😨
0:43 is so real
LoL 4 jams
james strait up dreamed wings of fire
Bro
10:33  maaz: no it was me I came and peed on u while u were in bed Me: huh kinky
I am soot you
4:28 this is why wizards suck theyre always up to no good witches ftw imo
Any one here in 2024
Huh. I once had a dream that my mom was stabbed to death in front of me by an intruder wearing a jack o lantern on his head.
13:38 sleep paralysis be like
Furrys are scarry

8:14 ITS SUPPOSED TO BE 69420
TheAMazeing didgital circus
I once had a dream where I was being chased by a gator idk why I just did
I had a dream where my friend and I were at school and then i said “hey *friends name* this is a dream” and then I said I CAN FLY and I flew a little bit before I went back to the ground 😂
8:24 WHEN DID LUIGI BECOME RELEVANT!?
Uhmmm do you hate furries odd1sout or something because  I’m not a furry myself but I thought u were a great YouTuber, but if u do I don’t respect u
I just realize. Most of James’s dreams has him as a bad guy except for the last one. He ended up in dragon prison. He joined a meeting for villains. And he did pot brownies. While Maaz dreamed of stopping an alien.
0:14 ...judge, he should be getting paid
Can’t remember my dreams or after I wake up that is most of them. I have three that I remember and then some of my dreams I get little bit of different dreams so probably get like 35 of them and one dream.
My favorite dream in this video was aquaman! Its so epik and diverse i wish i had a dream like maaz.

10:49 wasn't that Andy Grifith's: "just crazy"
I remember a long time ago i had a dream that i cried in the dream and i woke up crying
Watching this in 2024 sad that he doesn’t post anymore. Also this seen 0:43 💀
0:34 GYAT DAM
You made his eyes dissapear why??
AYO 0:44
Some time within the last decade, I stopped remembering dreams. Entirely. I don't know if something shifted in my brain chemistry or it's a side effect of my recovery (ongoing) from depression or what. It definitely feels like at some point, and on some level, I made the decision to close the door on my dreams, and that's sad, and yet, I feel like it was the right choice.
AMAAZING X ODDONESOUT?!?! 0:44
that wizard dream was actually sick
You had me at _"Zootopia Tiger."_ 😳
its just the legend of zelda botw but bad
Its gotta be good to not have werid dreams I DREAMED OF CHEESE BULLING ME LIKE WTF

Genshin impact Is a Zelda copy Zelda breath of the wild!!!
hes gays
0:43💀
Pause at 0:35
At 8:50 I had a similar dream but with a weird looking bee.
This video inspired me to write down my dreams. Almost all of them are really detailed, but one just says "silver spoon from inanimate insanity shot me 18 times in the chest??? He was wearing a tuxedo too, like the fancy prick he is.". Still have no idea what else happened in the dream-
Hey, James, don't feel bad about being a bedwetter until 8. My dog was one until she was 35 in human years and I used my pacifier until I was 9.
Actually cockroaches can fly in real life and I do right down my dreams too but with notes on my phone
0:35 why is bro caked up
I’ve had this reoccurring dream where I am sleeping on the top bunk of a bunkbed and lion King is playing on the TV and I wake up I look around and I looked down at the floor and I see all my toys springing to life and starting to follow me and chase me walk towards me and I jump down from the top bunk and run to the kitchen and then I see more toys coming out of the dumpsters the recyclables and I just stand there in the middle of the kitchen as I slowly watch them reach towards me and walk towards me when they finally reach me,I wake up.
I had a dream that was a mix between the movie Annie and the Holocaust. They kept the orphans in the orphanage for years until they took them to their execution where they were either shot or hung and you hoped you would get shot because you could avoid dying from that if you ate enough jello
I LIKE M E N 👁👄👁
When I clicked on the maartian wear link I got 3 notifications from windows defenders saying they detected trojan viruses, should I be concerned..?
Why are their dreams so complex, but mine are just like me walking around as if it was really life
Now let me see your browser history 0:41
0:35 GYAT
magic alien person who all they want is to see the water because on their planet is doesn’t exist, not even attacking you and you trick her and kill her for no frickin reason, like a frickin b*tch

My dreams are so horrific and vivid that I feel the pain in my dream

Genshin impact is just a bad version of legend of zelda.
Wof vibes 1:42

This egg-dream was horryfying xD
I remember a dream I had, and this was reoccurring in a way, where my mom yelled at me so much for either stupid things or things I didn’t do and in both of those dreams I cried so much, that I woke up with actual tears coming down my face. 😂
i love the wizard world, reminds me of dnd

“YOUR MY DREAM TOO “
Ok so I have 2 to say 1  Y IS THERE NO EYES 2 I LOVE Genshin Impact but I have to log back in for the thousand time lol 😭
CRAZY THING when i was younger i always could tell when i was gonna pee myself cause i would get a alert in my dream ⚠ and i would just wake up and go pee
The egg is so funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂 13:22
One time I dreamed that one of my nurses was a gigantic needle chasing me. It is her favorite dream. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My weird dream: So I was going to Universal studios, the one in California, and I saw the big spinning globe that's there when you enter the park, the second I stepped in, I realized I was in the open area of my elementary school and it was suddenly night time, and what I see is my classmates, dressed up in horror movie gear, having an absolute rumble, and there was also a store that was completely white, selling knives and stuff like that.
🤣
6:38 snowgrave route
Genshin Impact. War had been started. No peace. (This is joke)
james: is it time to get up? :creepy egg thing starts bouncing up and down: ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP IN HE MORNING ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP TODAY HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I had a crazy dream with Jimin from BTS in it. I was at a soccer game and all of the sudden there was this table in the middle of the field. I was sitting at the table across from Jimin other members were there but he’s who I remember vividly. And we were just talking and eating pancakes. Then I woke up.
I love the egg thing I can't stop watching
The thing with the egg made me laugh so hard I felt like I was breathing for life and I watched it again bc I can't on how it was scary and james concerned voice and it bouncing and yelling is too much
cockroaches can fly
when will maaz find out that you can gamble your own money for hot anime women that moan in the japanese dub in genshi-
13:47 was that The Bite of 87
donate for Luigi and other disabled people in your dream it might change their lives.
I had a dream one time that i finished watching courage the cowardly dog and the end credits started playing. But the song was distored and had what sounded like someone changing the radio station or cartoon static.  Well for some reason i go up to the tv to change it and hands come out of the tv to drag me inside. The hands also had the design from the outro on it. It was kinda scary.
1:42 ERM ACTUALLY THAT WOULDENT BE “FURRY PRISON” IT WOULD BE SCALIE PRISON >:3
4:28 sounds like this would make a compelling d&d campaign
First comment in 2 days
0:44 HELP
One of my dreams that I don’t need to right down becuase it annoyed me a lot was of me getting ready for school…  One day, I woke up got out of bed, went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and stuff, and pretty much got fully ready. Suddenly I heard my mom call me, I was turning around as she was calling me and I woke up… I found myself still in bed not ready at all and my mom next to my bed trying to get me out.   I don’t like getting ready in the morning because I sleep in when I am able to, so when I wake up for the day it normally has to be earlier than I prefer, so I go through the process of preparing in the morning being grumpy and tired.  Having to do that 2 times in one day is not nice at all.
I tried Genshin Impact before, my computer didn’t work with it at first, eventually I fixed it. I tried the game out, I got stuck on some point (I thought it was a story game, but maybe it’s more free Rome). Then soon I started hearing everyone trash talk the game, so I just stopped playing. It was kind of sad becuase the game doesn’t seem bad and I feel I haven’t given it a fair shot.
Every animation is freaking GOOOOOOD
They are.
I think you should do eyes
Pov everyone makes fan fics cause of that one comment
"Its time to get up its time to get up its morning its time to get up its time to get up hahahahaahahaha" I listened to that an ungodly amount of times for too long my stomach hurts and I can't breathe after the first time I saw it and now I can't stop thinking about it
He rallied the “OTHER DRAGONS” it’s confirmed
It's funny how weird it is to here how similar other people's dream are to yours
ITS REVVELIE! MY DAD WOKE ME UP WITH THAT FOR THREE YEARS
What is Loosa dreaming
I can’t play Genshin impact because I don’t play computer😢

Favorite art stile was Dragon Prison by Nine Noodles
EVEN ME AND MY FRIEND PLAYS GENSHIN AND WE ARE 10 YEARS OLD
Both in the same bed: Maaz: "So James do you wanna..."
Genshin Impact is AMaazing

I love how the animation just gets worse
0:11 ace attorney.
I love the part where James talks about his dream about Flumpty Bumpty
Unfortunately,I’m unable to sleep because I keep on getting nightmares about a NPC or something come out of nowhere 💀.
i wanna go to dragon prison
here are some dreams i had :)  1: i was walking out of a cafe with my family in some far far away state and the road just fell beneath my feet i fell down into this sewer system and my family were doing nothing at all and i just drifted off all the way to home where i was alone then i woke up :)  2: i had this pool in my backyard i jumped into it and after just falling down into the deep cold water i came across a mermaid village and i discovered i can breathe underwater then a mermaid noticed me and said "you dont belong here" and helped me get to the surface (keep in mind the village was like a huge vertical apartment complex underwater) but i jumped back in so i met the mermaid again they were getting annoyed because i dont belong there ( human ≠ mermaid ) so he forced me to the surface AGAIN and as the nonlistening person i am and i jumped in ONCE MORE then instead there was a different mermaid i saw then i woke up 3: i was in this daycare that had this tv head man he hated a type of book so i threw it out the window (i had other people with me) but he went on a MURDER RAMPAGE we all hid as fast as we could anyone who was caught got killed and it wasint just like stabbing or anything IT WAS RIPPING OUT ORGANS FROM THE THROAT i hid with another kid in a pile of weird discs that had the colors of spiderman he found me but i scurried away before he could get me then he tried ripping someones fingers off but failed miserably. he calmed down and play a few safe games to the survivors untill someone asked about the book again... CHASE SCENE TIME! :) he grew like 10× bigger and then the exit turned into this long long hallway we ran FOR OUR LIVES the walls and floors and roofs were covered in eyes and flesh (keep in mind i had this dream before the amazing digital circus and doors even existed) then i made it to the exit and left with my life! the end bonus: this is a short one i "woke up" from a bed in this weird place the roofs, walls, and floors were made of stuffing and pillows this is more of a weirdcore dream i talked to a weird half stuffed animal frog half human creature i forgot what they said tho. there was a playground in the middle of this strange world and other half stuffy half human creatures there was a door leading to this long non plush hallway and after i explored it i woke up :)  thats all!
Bro what did the alien magic person do they just wanted to see the ocean
as a furry i agree with furry prison🤓🤓
in the video go to 44 seconds
The community is gonna go WILD with these two
What
These guys got such silly dreams and here I am, literally never dreaming… ever.
I'm so jealous for them, because my own dreams aren't nearly that crazy. In fact, some of them could very well be turned into a semi-coherent, fan-made film.😴🎞
11:58 "Oh FUUUUUUUdge brownies!"😉
11:08  "You wet my bed?"             "That was gas talk, dude."😅
10:57 That looks a lot like Jaiden Animations.🤔
7:23 The birth of DJ Octavio.😂🐙
5:47 Coincidentally, two of the least popular magical elements in RPGs.😉💧🌀
4:37 Why does this sound eerily similar to Disney's Owl House?🤔🧙🦉
4:18 "Not me though, 'cause I got willpower! I can take it or leave it."😉
The egg looks like a seer of people
What was that intro scene? 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I get very weird dreams and they don't make since also they don't have a plot either
1:41  This NEEDS to be in oddballs (At least as a dream episode)
"She can absolutely step on me"
He loves genshin impact😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Subscribe to everyone in this video
W-why were they kissing 🧐
13:22 egg
Let me tell you my mystery dream (My dreams that have something weird happening and the dream is cut and I always remember it right now and in the future I guess. I never dreamt the cut part there), so I'm an object show lover and then this one dream where the star of the show had this one slumber party and I was there too when suddenly my sight turned black and I saw one word: "Disease". The star of the show lay on the ground and this one character (That wasn't even in the show) named Melon was dying and then there were like these Minecraft notification thingies and then it the last thing that I read was: "Melon will not mind soon" and before that last notification there was this one that said: "Melon has died". I think it was a few months ago :/
I love odd1nsout
ima gonna be honest i have waked up and then wet the bed more than wetting the bed while in a dream
Android users: ah what a beautiful sound to wake up too Apple Users: 13:40

The egg dream feels like an alarm
Dreams are strange, i know
I only had fun dreams and scary dreams
This is just one night at flumptys

Furry prison: the prison for furrys 😂😂😂😂

I feel like Maaz’s first dream was based on the sponsorship he just did
some jokes are wrong to do
EXCUSE ME WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THAT CLOUD?
I had a dream where haminations was in shorts wars
I really need to find some online friends that play genshin because none of my friends or online friends like to play it. I’ve been playing it by myself for so long
Bro wasnt weirded about the egg that he asked "is it time to get up" then was weirded out
it's time to get up it's time to get up it's time to get up good morning it's time to get up it's time to get up it's time to get up today AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

No thank you
#theodd1sout
One time in my dream, I was about to either poop or pee and then I immediately was thinking about how I got to the toilet. But I couldn’t remember how I got there so I realized that I was in my dream so I said “oh sh*t, I’m in a dream, I need to wake up” and so I woke up and went to the toilet and made it
cockroaches actually can fly btw
As of Oct 15, 2023, 1:50 AM EST this video has 666 dislikes.
Maaz's first dream was the epitome of spaceism
Q. what did you do on your Friday night  someone: I ate dinner with my girlfriend  maaz: I was casually killing a godlike creature from outerspace
1:43 dude hat dragon’s design looked like something straight out of a wof fanfic
Some cockroaches can actually fly.
13:23 this is the hardest I laughed in days, actually made my chest hurt. Thank you for this. Using it as my alarm tomorrow.
The crazy dream I was a little kid in my dream and I was angel but u didn't know how to fly and I was in a weird house and my family left me and never came back and a lady was training me to fly away to my home and I started crying and I woke up crying in my sleep while I was dreaming and my mom said hey why are you crying?
I loved the part when James gets triggered when he said this sponsored by genshin impact
Haha hahaha that at egg
It’s time to wake up. It’s time to wake up. It’s time to wake up in the morning. It’s time to wake up. It’s time to wake up. It’s time to wake up today. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha.
In the dream James has eyes

Man why dont my dreams make this much sense
omg i had a nightmare before watching this of this creepy demon disguised as an egg with a creepy smile...
Sometimes I dream that I peed, but I don’t pee my bed. I just think, oh I peed I’m good. But then I realize I still need to pee
THE LAST ONE HELPPP-
ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ON THE MORNING
sponsor CRINGE!!!!!
“Luigi, how do you expect to get down on one knee, without any knees?” Best line ever.
Can anyone give me a list of all the references in James perfect monster dream?
All of James dreams could make an interesting story. James started out as a drug addict and did some drugs with his friends. He then does more bad stuff and even got into a meeting for villains. One day he hit someone in dragon town and got sent to dragon prison. At night who haunts people who have done bad stuff haunted him for the night he was at the prison.
Every night I dream of getting what I want and everymorning I'm really sade
James fr be dirty 💀💀💀
James is going feral from the sponsors and ads
No geshin impact.
I like the Wizard Duel by PartyDave
It’s time to get up its time to get up in the morning
I kept rewatching the egg thing and bursting out laughing
2:25 is that fwench fwy? (The one in the top right corner)
does that one aminatios about peeing in bed lookd like jaiden animation.
Did someone notice that the dream of james (The egg dream)is kinda like the one night at flumptys right or is it just me?
Why does jame have two eyes??
You don draw pupils?
.
I have bad anxiety attacks so when I have dreams from the past I wake up crying and shaking
What you eat before sleep odd1sout?
GENSHINN IMPAMTTTTT
This isn’t a joke, but my mother used to sing me that song every time I woke up when I was like eight years old😮
Okay…so I had a dream one time where it was like really close to Halloween, and it was a contest to get a lifetime supply of candy, and if you had this card they gave by midnight you’d win the lifetime supply of candy, you could kill anyone you needed to to get the pass…definitely not worth it. It took place at my school and all the students and some of the parents took part in it. Last I left off, there was a break time on the football field where nobody was allowed to kill anyone until break time was over.
The Luigi bit was just sad :,<
Is nobody going to talk a about the fact that James dream was about a weird but annoying version of Flumpty Bumpty from One Night At Flumpty's? Am I the only person that noticed that?🤨
13:22  is time get up in the morning x ∞
Once I had a lucid dream when I was in bed
Me when they say stuff about furry prison: oh boy, this is gonna be interesting
Egg
it's okay guys, my step sister didn't stop wetting the bed until she was 16 :3 and she will never see this comment *laughs manically*

After this, I was scared of eggs for a *TINY* while. (For a year)
12:46 The lesson of this story is don’t steal James’ brownies or your gonna suffer the consequences.
Dang that last one was scary and also made me crack up.
At the end they really hade pot brownies
I had this extremely vivid extremely WEIRD dream.  It’s a bit long so get ready.  It’s starts with me and my family in an airplane, on our way to visit my dad’s old friend. We get to the house which is surrounded by forests in the middle of nowhere, and my dad was going to help him move boxes while me and my mom swam in their pool.  We get in the pool, it’s all nice, and chill- and oh my god, there’s a dead body in the pool. But no one believes me!!  Me and my mom go inside the house and as we walk around her voice keeps changing, so we go out front. Running towards us from the woods is a stampede of lions, bears, and elephants.  We do the most logical thing and run up a hill behind the house.  However, there was a pot of honey on top of the hill, so instead, we slide back down. I remember that I fell on the way down and struggled to get up.  Thankfully, however, a unicorn came and saved us from the bear chasing us.  Lions tried to get to us, but the unicorn was too tall for it to reach. It dropped us off at a school bus, but for some reason my mom decided she didn’t want to get on the bus. She wanted to get onto a Safari bus! I got on the school bus and my dad was there waiting.  The school bus had a screen, projecting the next destination, which happened to be my elementary school park. Awesome I can go home now! JK, the bus gets run over by a train.  AND THE DREAM RESETS! But it’s OK, because I remember everything! But nobody believes me AGAIN! And another family friend is now here, but for some reason she’s Asian now! And the dead body is just a plank of wood!  And that’s it. There’s no resolve. I love that dream!
Alarm clocks be like
Bro I got a genshin impact ad right before this video
why dont we have that irl 5:44
IT WAS ME JAMES.
Once I had a dream where I woke up in a lab it looks like it might be something like Rick and Morty and Futurama and then I walk out of the room and I’m in a library and the main cast from Mickey Mouse is with me apparently and a giant minecraft axolotle  and we just had to figer out how to get out it was crazy
I never thought I needed this but turns out I do. Also, I would love to maybe animate this! Do I have permission to? I’ll give credit to you for the audio!
Strange thing is I can still remember some of my dreams. My favorite dream I can remember is being a Buddhist Monk in a Temple. Surprisingly I had hair on my head. But our Temple was attacked and their Leader aimed a gun at my head and shaved my head bald. The Monks walked over to me and called me the Lama.
I was little and I ate something bad,(I thought I was DIEING
I had this dream where Salty (Shgurr), Jordoom (Rush Light) and NegaAiden (me) were on electric guitars, and Tabbes was on drums. The four of us were on stage in front of a crowd and playing “It’s my life” by Bon Jovi.
Im a ✨potato✨
13:43 Is That Flumpty?
Ive had a couple weird dreams but heres one i had just tonight  What happened was I was playing TOS2 (Town Of Salem 2), and I rolled the witch. It was like a role though that was like in the original TOS1 where they were alone. Eventually what happened was I left as the witch and won (not supposed to happen) and then there were more witches after that. What the absolute fuck.
Are they actually together
there is some sexual tension between mass and james
Magic Maaz: "We must kill all illegal aliens!"
One night: I had a dream about, (I’ve started watching bluey a lot a few days before this because I got interested on why it’s popular), I was dreaming that I was in bluey’s trampoline for some reason, and bluey came out and was like, “*my name* wanna go play with us? “WHO TF ARE YOU!?* ( for some reason I didn’t know who bluey was but she did) then I ran up their fence in panic and when I think I got ran away enough, I went into a open field, pulled out my phone and start freaking watching actual bluey, but then the scary part happens: I realize I’m watching an unknown episode, where bluey and bingo are playing but pass out randomly, and a text in the bluey logo font says: “it’s 12:52, wake up…” then I pass out, fall to the ground and I wake up at 12: frikin 51,. This didn’t happen long ago but I didn’t watch bluey for that next day…  time stamp: aquaman
on time in my dream everybody was not normal and they were just like a blob my dad was add was putting me into bed I needed to be there needed to go in bathroom dad came in we merged with my dad and they start peeing in the toilet and then when I woke up I realized I Peed my pants
i hate genshin impact
I had a dream that during me being in World War III and being friends with Sonic the Hedgehog being my friend that actually made me question my mental health. I was out on patrol with Sonic on a big boat when a Russian Team Rocket guy breaks in and kicks us off the boat. Sonic and I are lost at sea, and the embodiments of life and death stand before us. We choose the path of death, and we’re transported to sort of a transition to the afterlife where we get to trash on random Pokémon. Once we get to the afterlife, that’s where the dream ends. I think I might be depressed.
What the hell is humour these days
FLUMPTY BUMTY
the egg made me burst out laughing cause its too random, like imagine it being harmless but dancing because its a beautiful morning.
I alway get those dreams where I think I’m peeing but then I pee irl. Something close to this happened to me too. I was playing at my friends birthday party/mega sleepover. I was playing Vr and I s want a table bc I was tired of standing so I tried to lean on it, went through it and fell

Edit 2: thankfully I dont have scary nightmares anymore

I recently had a weird nightmare where there was a couple and the wife handed her husband a bag full of black licorice and the husband started eating it and they were watching a horror movie called black horse where it showed some black lace making the shape of a horse while watching the husband starts giggling like a little child the wife looks at him and smiles then continues watching the movie then the husband said “ * giggles * funny tail " and when he said that the horse looked at its tail and wagged it he then said “ funny legs " then the horse moved its neck when he said that he became the horse and started to eat his wife then his wife started screaming I then “ woke up " got my phone and tried looking at funny videos to calm me down but when I searched up some funny videos it just showed me memes of the Mandela catalogue and cartoon cat and pictures of the devil I then searched up try not to laugh but when I did I saw a video called try not to cry and the thumbnail was a picture from the holocaust I then actually woke up and started having an anxiety attack I think it was from the nightmare being so realistic but idk
I had a dream once where I got chased by a baby tyrannosaurus rex that could only say the phrase "silly things" in a nasal British voice (Grian's specifically)

. . . I had a dream a few days ago . . . Not gonna go into detail but there was a bunch of timers going off in a weird pattern-ish sound And I couldn't figure out how to stop it-  a while later I woke up. . .   The timers beeping was the birds chirping, cause I left my window open-

I once had a dream where I woke up in a deserted wasteland and then someone came to me in a dune buggy (I think maybe one of my school teachers) and picked me up. So we arrived in a grassy dark area. So we were in a village made out of a giant tree and we took some stairs to our bedroom and got to sleep. When we woke up it was still dark and we exited the tree and went to the next tree which was twice as tall and our bedroom was at the very top along with the medical room; it was so high up that I complained about the height for a few minutes before I stopped (this tree had bouncy mushrooms instead of stairs lol) I stopped complaining and started to experiment by pulling out an iPad and opening the sky view app; it didn’t work and instead said “sorry but you are not in the right dimension” I did some more experiments but I don’t remember what they were. We woke up and exited the tree to do target practice (for some reason all my friends from school were there including my crush so that was nice. Now that I think about it the dream probably had my friends and teachers in it cuz it was term break back then and I really missed the teachers and my friends) I was selected to be in the same group as my crush along with a strong cool kid and that’s all I remember.
If dreams mean something then what dose my dream about wings of fire characters being torched in a cold shower by a furry mean… I actually dreamed about this I think theirs something rong with me.
What r pop brownies?

Bro really talked about a dream that had pot brownies in it and then at the end they are eating pot brownies🗿
All my dreams are lucid dreams. If you read this comment, you are now my lucid student. If you lucid dream, there is one major challenge, and it is the fact that lucid dreams can easily turn to sleep paralysis. Also my demon is named glitch and he’s weird. That aside, once I was lucid dreaming, and I was just in this hotel building, then an alarm blared the building shook and started crumbling, and a crack opened up in the ground. But in my dream (and most likely in real life since I sleep talk) I just said, “Ah h*ll nah” and woke  up before sleep paralysis hit 😂. I love my control over my dreams!
Lol 1:09
Getting rainbow vibes and I'm not opposed
When I've played genshin it feels like a sort of rip of  breath of the wild

Good vid my favorite of the dreams shown in the vid was the one with the "perfect monsters" and The dragon prison one is my second favorite and I like the concept of the video like recording your dreams I'd like to see more of those kind of videos and overall this video was just great 10/10
The weirdest dream i can remember was when i was 5 or 6, and basically, i was in a maze, in a birdseye view, and count dracula from sesame street had trapped me, and i just remember being like 'i don't wanna be trapped here, i don't wanna!'
When I was in kindergarten I had a nightmare where I got homework

Usually I wake up from a dream and I'm like "whoa, that dream was epic." but forget what happened as I think that.
Maaz: no eyes Rebbeca: no mouth  I'd *love* to see them collab             this comment is really old and corny why are y'all still interacting with it 😕
The egg one was probably your alarm clock

I’ve been having a consistent dream about running from something and hiding in a bathroom, but unable to lock the door because I fumbled the lock for too long, and then I had to press my weight against the door because it was trying to force its way into the bathroom and then I wake up when the door opens

MY DREAM LAST NIGHT  Shrek and Fiona have 1 child in this  dream a little girl and they really wanted to go to a theme park but ogres weren’t allowed to enter the place.They went to ogre mart and got sweat pale skin paint and pale skin paint. The sweat paint would only show up if you were in a sunny area or an area where sweating is bound to happen. So they all put on the paint but then before Fiona put on her paint she put the normal one on. When they got there they realized how some really good kid rides were inside but Fiona was the only one that had two layers along with the daughter so Shrek put on a hoodie and a wig of 2012 emo hair, then Fiona said, Let me do the talking and if anyone asks who are just say your my son in his sophomore year in high school  So the guy at the entrance looks for any ogre looks and asks why they have the ogre like ?horns? They said it was from plastic surgery and the little girl’s is from alergic reaction to apples. So they got on the first ride but in the line tied the hood tag to the super glued wig glued with the world’s strongest glue. Shrek was like , Mum please stoup messing with my hair it is very superb and not for you to be touching. And then I woke up
hmmm huhh maaz's 1st dream sounds like a ripoff of avatar

This one fictional character has shown up in my dreams three times. He's not even my favorite character in the series he's from, but he was in at least three dreams that I remember (although one dream had two of him, but they looked a bit different and I assume that they're clones).  The character was Hunter from The Owl House.
That wizard dream is my favorite    That was a sick fight

Ok here's my nightmare so this one takes place in a video game ok so the game had just dropped we were looking for Easter eggs so after a bit of looking I turn around and there's this shadow figure and my character rushes at it automatically and then its black and there's a voice it says "I would have done the same thing" now i excluded a very creepy part that most of you wouldn't want to read
once I had a dream I was on the GIANT playground and there was a huge hole in the ground, and my friend was on the ground, and there was a monster that looked humanoid, but with red claws and wings, I tried to warn my friend but I was so high up he couldn't hear me, and it took my friend into the hole, and then came after me and stared me right in the eye, then I woke up... ANYWAYS THATNK YOU FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK
The last dream is the reason why I can’t sleep tonight.

13:22 One Night at Flumpty's moment
I had a dream where I was in a universe that everyone only speak and numbers and emojis I tried to talk like them but I accidentally said your life is going to end animoji this is how you say your life will end animoji 👯🐝🤮🥱👍👍😡🔍😄😂🧠💀👂
I had a dream where I was in this world and everyone spoke in French
My dream recently was that I was outside in a parking lot, and I had a whole entire bathroom attachment that I had to connect somewhere and it was raining and no one was around. I was with my mom and sisters and I saw a man with a tent and asked him if we could attach the bathroom to the tent and he said yeah, and so I attach it and then It disappears and a whole bunch of people gather around to watch a magic show ans Albedo from Genshin Impact was there. I asked him to to a magic trick where he takes and ring and turns it to water, so he spots this grey silver ring with a deep blue square gem in the middle and uses it. I thought to myself he can just turn things into whatever but I watch him as he takes water while no one is looking, spits it in his hand, slides the ring away, and throws the water on everyone like he made the ring disappear. Everyone liked the trick except me who was mad he didn’t actually just turn it into water and I kept yelling at him until I woke up 💀
WHY DO YOU DONT HAVE EYES

The Egg reminded me of Flumpty.
Man these are all so coherent. The last dream that I had and can remember is chasing some guy down for his hat in an IKEA with walls made of wet paint.
Well at least YOUR dreams make sense.

Bros still in there💀

I had this one crazy dream that I fully remember even though I had it like 2 years ago.
Once I had a dream where I was in a mr beast challenge and we were in a library with no roof and the shelf’s were white and when I was opening a gift and then I woke up
When I was 4. I had a dream where a cookie robot tried to strangle me in a pub.
Ok Bring me  there please ama kill the  furrys
The earliest Dream I can remember was when I was still sleeping in a crib. It was a white void with black holes in it, and I was running from Dr. EggMan from the sonic series. He had a large hammer and that’s about all I remember.
There was this one dream… not quite sure what it meant but I was in like a dark dungeon or mansion that was just a vertical tower. I was there with my sister, Fin and Jake from adventure time (the show I grew up on), and another cartoon character that I can’t remember. We started falling down the tower, and I got attacked by a couple ghosts and giant spiders, until we all reached the bottom. I had now disappeared and my consciousness was in my sister’s body. We saw a bottomless pit that went into the abyss, and with my consciousness now transferred into Fin’s body, I fell into the hole and then woke up.
I had a reoccurring nightmare where each night would start as a different dream, usually with me, my brother, and my sister in it. Then I’ll end up straying from the two and end up getting caught by a bear possessed by all my darkest fears. I would scream for help, but it’d come out as a whisper. Sometimes I’d see my brother and sister ignoring me because I couldn’t yell loud enough. The bear slowly started eating me, making my voice quieter and more drowned out, until I’d lose hope of escape, and the final thing I’d see before waking up was the bear’s jaw closing over my head. I was too scared to fall asleep every night not because I was afraid of monsters in my closet or under my bed like normal kids, but because I was scared of having this dream again… I was a messed up child.
I had a dream one time where my older sister would turn into a giant monster (like 10x the size of Godzilla) and every time she did the rest of my family and I would have to run to the nearest bathroom (which was always like ten miles away for some reason), re-assemble the toilet, and flush ourselves down the toilet to go to a parallel dimension where my sister didn’t get mad yet… I don’t know I was a weird child.
I love genshin :D
Wait a sec you can only dream about things you have seen before… 👁👄👁 if you know you know

One time I was sleeping with my older brother, (SEPARATE BEDS!) and I was still awake trying to sleep, and my brother sits up, grabs his phone saying " I goa tex (name)" and he started typing on his phone. The next day my sister gets a text saying something about icecream? In a nutshell, my older brother slept texted.

A week or two ago, I had a dream where a wasp was flying around a toddler version of my little sister, and my older sibling was yelling "SAY SOMETHING" in increasing levels of panic. Then the wasp flew towards me right before I woke up, and a screamed thinking that there was a wasp in my bed.
I think Funymony's one is going to give me nightmares

One that I can distinctly remember is one that I use for my story. It takes place in Japan and is a disgraced politician in the 19th century. I was basically just the camera behind the dude, but I watched as he met two painters, a Chinese scientist, and a French mailwoman. It was weird, but I really liked this so I’m planning on making this into a story. Don’t ask me about my brain, it just happened.

One time my dad gave me a book about Dreams Psychology and it was just a list of things that could possibly pop up in ones dreams and what they symbolized or meant. I started writing down my dreams because I was intrigued and not even a week goes by and I have the most vivid dream about a couple riding a train, but the train leads to mysterious rooms that were far too big to be in a train. I woke up at a really...interesting part, and wrote 6 full pages of this dream. My dreams became more detailed, I actually started to remember what happened in them the day before, and the moment I stopped I never had a dream again such as the train dream that I remember in such detail.
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Here have a dream of mine: I once had a dream where i was laying on my stomach, like i usually sleep, and then something clambered up my legs and sank a knife into my back Heres the thing though: i was 100% sure i was awake before this
May I tell that my dreams are either weird or creepy or both. There is no in between. Soo I was about to go to bed(in my dream) and  it seemed like I had a nightmare and well I woke up(still in dream) I was looking around trying to calm down, I tried to go back to sleep but then a creepy shitty face appeared infront of me and I woke up AGAIN(dream still) I decided to lay back down again with my face down the pillow so I dont get jumpscared again but then I felt like I was suffocating and couldn't get air. That's when I woke up for real and had a really hard time trying to sleep again🏃🏼   Some of my dreams also includes anime characters that doesn't even exist in real life and can interact with me and we're friends😭
Surprise cockroaches can and do fly
I feel sad I can’t dream when I sleep all I see is darkness pure darkness
Luigi noooo they took your kneecaps
aquaman
You did not animate this.
i dont sleep walk but i sleep talk. my family tells me storys of me answering questions like eyes open or sitting up but i always never get up to walk. then i wake up and am like "what u talkin abt?"
I remember a dream where I was a kid again and for some reason we were in the road at night for no reason. we stopped at this sketchy abandoned looking motel type of thing. He stepped out by some containers. (those giant metal ones) and I thought this was normal for some reason. and then a werewolf (looks like the one from god of war rangnarok or god of war 2018) and went out instantly biting his head of killing him. I love my dad the most in this world he is legit my number 1. I love nothing more then him. I woke up crying at like 2 am and couldn't go back to sleep. And that's it.
OTS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNING ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP TODAY
FURRY PRISON!
Ok so, when I was eight we had a huge garden and we got chickens and put them in our shed. Then one night I had a dream, it started when I went outside and one of the chickens were eating chicken poop, so I gave it some ‘golden seeds’ then it TALKED TO ME and I was totally chill like this was normal and i asked it if it wanted to go for a walk. It said ´yeh sure’ like in this really deep voice, so I got a LEASH like out of nowhere and put it on the chicken. Then we went outside and she ate some grass but she sounded like a lawn mower… I then used her as a lawn mower on all the rest of the grass and I let her off the leash, she went INSIDE MY HOUSE and my mum asked her if she was hungry totally ignoring me and the chicken said ´i could go for some porridge´ again in this really deep voice. So she ate the porridge went back to the shed and I woke up. I told all my friends at school about it the next day and I still remember most of it to this day 🤣🤣🤣 (Sorry for all the spelling mistakes and thank you for taking the time to read this)
Oh it was just because I was at home the homepage not videos
That one is deleted
I don’t dream
Is pretty crazy mine is somebody about time I want to watch the whole video anyway it's about dying if I'm electricity these light bulb these like things that turn on and and only the man died theaters was able to run away the explosion and that was j away from here it was actually at Christmas the worst day the worst year they'll have a bad dream but the worst dream of Christmas would be the naughty list the naughtiness for children
Theres this thing that reminds me of the roach dream actually, One night when i had woke up i had watched something scary dont remember what it was and i go to sleep but later i wake up and i hear scrwtching which spooked me to my core It took me a minute to get out of bed to check and when i did there was this pretty big roach on my tissue box scratching and i am TERRIFIED of insects so i jumped and ran Just thought it was similar lol
I feel like the animation gets worse everytime.
I once had a dream where I drank glue and then ate a chicken and fell into the glue stick and got stuck inside
I had a strange dream as the  wizard duel   But everyone had magic and tamed a dragon baby so they got angry then I turned into a dragon  to protect the baby

My weirdest dream is when I was in a level like game i was walking until I fell into the ground then a rake was trying to hit me in the ground then I got teleported to a house tried to hide then I got found stabbed healed and then I woke up
I once had a dream that was the worst dream in my life what happened was I was like inside and stuff watching TV like you were and then there's these people that just come in take my dog replace it with a different dog and run outside I tell my mom and dad what happened they don't believe me of course because imagination so I was scared out of my mind so I like chase after those people and then we find out it was just a vet but they actually want vet services evil people pretend to be vets so I like really bad and then my dog died but doesn't turn into a ghost and then it goes saves everybody and stuff so then we're okay and stuff I don't know why I'm okay so then I get my dog back oh happy my mom and dad don't even know what this happened and yeah pretty much that's what happened
I once had a dream where I woke up in my bed ( for context my room is across from my parents) looked into my parents room and it looked really dark and scary like it just straight up looked like a void into the unknown and I just said out loud " I'm too tired to deal with this shxt" and then went back to "sleep" and then I woke up in real life

I had a weird dream. it started when i was in a boat paddling using my own hands to escape 4 bullies who were after me for some reasons, when i made it on the land the bullies starts chasing me foot by foot and i hid on the bushes and running while hidden, i later spotted a mall so i go in so they won't find me i explore further in the mall then i got lost,     i saw a escalator that looks dangerous and people seem fine about it and said "c'mon try it it's safe" i said no! and started crying and my big brother saw me and calm me down, then a folder appeared near my face and opened i saw a furry with a white mask my big brother said: "hey i know that guy" and then i was like "yah yah whatever" i still don't know where is this from, when i blank my eyes the folder and big brother are gone and I'm in the moving train instead of in the mall that's how my dream ends
Is it odd I want to dream about the demonic egg?

I've had lucid and vivid dreaming since I was a kid. Still have them actually! I can remember pretty much all my dreams since back when I was six years old. I wrote down most of my dreams too!   Problem is most of my dreams were either nightmares or fanfiction(and nightmares) so I couldn't like publish them anywhere without getting copy writed or something... Plus most of my dreams were super weird(all the nightmares anyways) and some of them were embarrassing(the fanfiction ones), so yeah....   I love the idea of animating weird dreams though!
ITS TIME TO GET UP JAMES🥚😀🙂
I still remeber one of my dreams being like i was sleeping with my mom (i was 6 years oldback then) and kinda just laying there and could only move my head, then i looked to the left and the window was just black so you didnt see the latern outside and i was just confused then i looked to my right to see my mom and she wasn't there so i looked left again and weard distorted faces came out of the black window, and i was litterally scared and looked to the right again cause maybe my mom would be there, but nope she wasn't i looked to the left again and now the faces came out of the window with weard very long black arms and grapping on something to get up to the hight of the bed cause we were sleeping at an high bed and i was so scared that i violently shaked my head and right before one of those faces touched touched me, i hit my moms head so hard with my head that we both woke up cause of the pain and she was super calm about it. Also like 2 months later i had it again but in my own bed and its was exactly the same exept i woke up cause the face touched me with his hands and i was so scared so i woke up and after that i never had the dream again.
Luigi, how do you expect to get down on one knee if you have no knees?
why are they on the casting couch?
can we have another
@TheAMaazing I create my own dream with story’s that I create with scenarios then if i wake up the next day i don’t remembered them but when i go back to sleep i just do it again trying to remember what i saw see and told in my head last night and if im successful i can just start from were i left of if you want me to tell you more you can ask.
13:33 yo is that flumpty
I loved this video makes me remember the old dreams I had as a kid
I actually rarely dream, its all black when I sleep. When I do, I actually text them to my best friend and then we just laugh it out.  Good times, hopefully I’ll dream again soon
I agree with James about gemish impact
Me: Has anyone dreamt of doing house chores and ends up doing them as they sleep walk Them: Um.... Me: Yeah me neither
Weird Dreams: - Playing chess to pass time as i fall to my doom - Running from an evil organization that was driving in a FBI veichle and im the one aiming a bazoka at them. (High speed chase by a harbor) - Stuck inside of a video game and if i die, then i die - Relived (more like dreamt) an episode of steven universe when he went into his Gem room for the first time and it was collapsing to impecable doom. - Spiderman killing tomatoes - Avengers assemble but dollar tree version - Graduation day: I was in another high speed chase in a Yellow Mustang and I got Hit by a train then glitched into subspace. I don't understand this one. - Having my own cooking show and burning all my food. - My house buried in sand at the beach - I fight this weird hoolagin who wants to take over the world with pineapples and i beat him up with my powers. To be honest, this dream i feel like I had full control over. - Riding my bike at the beach in an infinite loop. - Dreaming that everyone died and I was the only person on a planet. But then I got hit by a car that a duck was driving. -Rewatching an episode of spongebob "Still no pickles... See... bleh" - Pokemon World Champion in pokemon universe - Tom Nook Hunting me down - Drowning in a vortex of water - (I slept walked in this one) Doing house chores

I like the animation on the perfect monster segment
I remember this one dream I had like a month ago, it started with me and my friends getting employed in Tesco and my year 6 teacher was there and told us to sort candles, then I was in a classroom full of cats and they all had really weird markings on their fur, one of them had a black stripe,  a red stripe and a green triangle, all of a sudden we all stand on the tables and fight this monster by chucking flapjacks at its head and then it just runs away.

i love dingle noodle drawing part and the others.
I love the second art stile
when a dream about magic wizards feels like  episode 1 to a magic based anime
One time I had the same dream for like a week it went like this.There was a mayor running a small town he was sad until a nice lady came  and after talking they were friends 6 years later a tornado came it destroyed half the town and it killed the lady the mayor was looking for her until he saw her body then he buried her near a river with tears in his eyes.One year later the grave got struck bye lightning after a while the same tornado came that killed her but this time it was different the grave glowed a bright light then the mayors friend was floating in the air she was the one who was glowing the mayor could barely recognize her she had made the tornado disappear the mayor ran to see her but she did not say anything he told her all the fun they had but still nothing he had started crying that his old friend didn't remember him she started remember him because of when he buried her she remembered him after that he was so happy after a while she was becoming normal again and nothing bad happened ever again.

I've had dreams where I've gotten so mad, and reel back to punch whatever/whoever, made me mad, and then I wake up punching the bed above me, because I sleep in a bunk bed.
5:11 if she didn’t know what water was then why is she talking about it?😮
i had this dream a year ago where i was some weird elf pixie thing and there were more of us in some supermarket/warehouse thing and we went atound causing havoc and there were these girls who were pricks, put on magic earring, became giant mutant furry things and completely demolished the place. vines grew everywhere and we spat a pledge of revenge against them. we created a plan, baited them over and turned them back normal by taking the earrings.

Not them at the end of the video casually getting in the same bed
I had a dream about bee swarm simulator… if you don’t know what is then go the roblox and search it up. Anyways! I dreamt of it and there was pipes and a bee bear and i giant normal bee so weird. It was a secret level lol.
Had a dream that i woke up from multiple times, but then continued when i fell back asleep. Power of flight but it ran on emotions so if i was scared I'd start losing control. Well it started out in a village with straw huts and i was being chased so i crashed into a hut, woke up, went back to sleep, exited the straw hut into medieval times being chased by a dragon to crash through a castle wall, woke up again, went back to sleep to crash into an office building window on the higher floors, somersault down the cubicle lane and hit some guy's office door where he opened it, saw me passed out. shrugged like "well, time to call an ambulance" and just dragged me in the office like it was a normal day. if you wanna time travel, bust through walls.
Are you Jan or no cuz I'm confused you look the same.
I am James right now
How do you see with no eyes?
Theamaazing x the odds ones out because I saw something

Ima tell you about my dream i had a long time ago that i cant stop laughing at.     Ok so i dont dream alot but one night i was asleep and started dreaming about me and my family going to a restaurant. After that we all stepped out and this creepy man with a axe i think juat threw all of us onto the wall and just started saying something. I dont remember what he was saying, but then a employee rushed out to help my family, and thats all what i remember in that part. Next thing you know im on a light tower with celestia from my little pony litting everything up. Then i woke up, and all i felt was fear about the dark. XD i cant stop laughing at this now.
Genshin impact is not free it costs you not touching grass... Forever
Or u gay
the last dreem seemed scary and funny
Lol
0:43 NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT 😂😂😂
(Cockroach) if I heard that sound coming from under the tv cabinet I would immediately know it was maaz.
The way the perfect monsters dream is put together reminds me of the smg4 episode about dreams.
I love  playing  GENSH impact
My weirdest dream is where I’m being chased by the ego head from marvel and I run into the woods to escape it but it finds me and then I wake up (this was a re appearing dream
I need a part 2. I need it now
I have always have had night terrors or nightmares including people with squid heads giant cannibal rats vicious monkeys my own parents turning into monsters then I had to kill them giant monsters picking up my house and eating my entire family being chased down streets by a variety of monsters and that was only scratching the surface that egg dream was very similar to one I had when I was about 9 and instead of an egg it was a long lanky figure with mouths covering his body and one giant horn and it said you cant see over and over again.
Once, I think I was half lucid dreaming but I was apparently dumb in my dream bc I went around asking ppl to pinch me 🥲
13:22 T E R R F Y I N G  E G G
I had a dream where it was a murder mystery, but with dragon ball characters. I remember that Goku got arrested for murder. I ended up investigating it or something, then it turns out that Gohan was the murderer and framed Goku. We both instant transmissioned to king Kai’s planet I think. I talked with the Ginyu force about something, then I had an epic anime battle with Gohan.
13:41
I don’t have dreams
but also the wizard one is epic my element would be ghost so i can like use shadows and ghosts to my aid
so this video explains your obsession with wizards right?
AMazzing is AMazzing
I have lucid dreams, and can’t get rid of it, it’s fun, but the problem is you might only dream of the same thing every night.
Hello maaz I found your channel via theodd1sout and i am also maaz! So yeah I just wanted to say that there's actually no other point for this comment :)
The comment below me is the best youtuber EVER
this is exactly why some people have to get bullied
they have cool story dreams like these and mean while i was in the backrooms benig chsed by the rock ;-;
I appreciate that it was daisy that Luigi proposed too
Like, all my dreams happened when I was a little kid, but I think my favorite, and probably the weirdest one, was whem I was running from a tornado, that had a face for some reason, with a wagon of food. But I had somehow and for some reason made all the food containers look empty, and when the tornado caught up to me it grabbed a thing of food, opened it, and cried when it was empty. I realized it was hungry and shared my food with it, then I woke up. What's even funnier is I live in California, so I think with how young I was and having never seen a tornado I thought that's what a tornado was and my brain was trying to tell me what to do if a tornado ever happened.

13:32 oh mah gawd it’s flumpty
10:45 reminds me of a dream and at the end bleach was poured on me and I felt it so I woke up and I had peed the bed
In reference to James dream about villains, I’d kill for the lack of sore throat, zits, and ingrown toenails, as I’m dealing with all three rn (yay Covid)

In the spirit of this video I am eating chipotle before bed 🤤
Ok after ten times trying to watch this video I finally made it past Jame's dragon dream. It was fun:) I started lucid dreaming when I was about 13. If I try, I can fly at will in my dreams but honestly as I get older it freaks me out a little so I just opt for autopilot dreams mostly lol
JAMES IN SMASH!?
in the egg for the horror game 1 night a flumptys
I once had a dream,  where I was in a very colorful (idk if I spelled that right) hallway. And my siblings and I were called into this small blue room. And there was a giant stick man. Like literally he looked like groot. And then he just started yelling for no reason. And the second he started yelling he was like, creepy. Like uhh- like just a pile of broken sticks, but in the formation of a human. So yeah that's one of my weirdest dreams. It was kinda creepy tbh

THE GOD DAMN EGG GODS JAMES ARE U OKAY WHY DID THEY SEND OUT DA EGG SHADOW DEMON EGG
I have lucid dreams sometimes, They range from a Bunch of human heads with really long necks and blank expressions peeking up around my bed (they all look like mark zuckerburg), to my dead grandparents coming in and asking me what boba tea is
I lucid dream all the time
Dragan prison sounds nice
Bruh the dragon person came straight out of wings of fire.
Pause At 0:35
Is it just me or is it more likely to get dreams when you sleep in a different place
5:08 1 she’d have to be made of something other than mana to have a physical organic form  2 if she already knew about existence of water somehow why didn’t she land in an ocean  And 3 if she can use magic to get to another planet why can’t she use magic to see an ocean in her own head like realistic virtual reality
*furry prison HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM* once I had a dream where my dad in the dream went to buy milk in the store we had stopped at (we were in a car) he got out and for some reason I was sitting in the driver’s seat when I accidentally hit the brake or something, the car started moving so I tried to park it again. At this point I had hit a lamppost and was going down the road, I remembered that my real mom had once showed me the brake to a car. I pushed it down, and I could feel it beneath my feet, but the car didn’t stop… I panicked and felt around for the other pedals but they weren’t there… also for some reason flamingo’s avatar was on the side of the road… 0-0 but then I woke up and realized I had been actually wiggling my foot around 😂 and another time I woke up (in the morning) to this black figure standing over me watching me sleep (this was on last Sunday) I acted asleep for about 5 seconds before either whispering, or murmuring in my head the word boo. The thing started back and hit it’s head on the top bunk… then it lunged forward and started tickling my stupid belly (I have problems judging my appearance :<) I was frozen, my body choosing freeze over fight or flight (which would have been hard since I was laying in the far side of the bed next to the wall) but my instinct kicked in and I swatted at it, it disappeared… I sat up and kind of laughed to myself before heading downstairs, I didn’t know until the next night I had been really set off by it… I stayed up until 1:30 in the morning terrified I would meet it again… eventually I fell asleep. And that’s where this story ends…
13:23 egg
Aquaman.
My brain prdictid fnaf lonly Freddy I’m not joking
I find it funny to think about the fact that the first two dreams could take place in the same world. XD
guess it was time to get up
seeing these dreams through all the different animators’ styles was super cool!
13:42 this is a horrifying nightmare
When you lucid dream about committing suicide twice: what does it mean?
This made me have a nightmare
"this video is sponsored by Genshin impa-" "AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHH"

I once had a dream where I went into one of those tall red Samurai buildings that have multiple roofs and inside it was like a museum with a bunch of things in glass containers, but on one wall there was a bunch of red school lockers and I opened one them and there was a weird looking girl with crazy hair and a weird but not deformed face, and then she flew out of the locker and I turned around to look at her and the building was half gone and the ground and sky and everything besides the building, the girl, and me was gray, then the dream was over.
My dream was beautiful i was having a good day and me and my nintendo saw this new game pokemon scarlet and violet but then when i was gonna play it boom gone
Genthin impact- Zelda Breath Of the Wild  (do u see a difference )
Dragon Prison, Pot Brownies, Eggs, There is defiantly something we can learn about James from this.
7:55 is my new background now
GENSHIN IMPACT IS AMAZING >:( SOMEONE JUST LOST A SUB :(((( (jk) also that wizard dream kinda sounds like genshin impact 💀
Stop stop stop please I’ve heard genshin impact too many times
I like the one animated by NineDoodles
FUN FACT:  Psychology studies show that if you remember your dream perfectly, your body and possibly the universe is trying to tell you something about your self or about what’s happening out there 🤓🤨🧐
aquaman
wait on the wizard story what did the alien do?
Flumpty Bumpty
Genshin raiden is less dummy thicc than metal gear raising raiden

13:32 NEW HORROR GAME "the egg"
Thanks for the tips, can’t believe James hasn’t lucid dreamed I do it almost every other night. The weirdest lucid dreams are when I know it’s a dream while dreaming.

Egg reminds of me of onaf (one night at flumpty’s
My 2 favorite parts of this video:  1. A Q U A M A N 2. Flumpty tells James it's time to W A K E  U P
Reoccurring dream:this giant ant kept folowing me.i thought it was normal at first but then it strted growing a creepy smile and it caught me.The thing was i heard a laugh similar to the ants voice.But i went to doctor recently and it was bc i opened my head when the dream strated happening and it was hallucination bc i have a little brain damage lol.everytime i wake uo i think about it and think”why was i scared of this”but the only thing that scares me till now is the laugh that was just hallucinations and stuff.still thats kinda weird and creepy.(btw i have anxiety bc of me opening my head when i was little lol)But im always knowing that ant was just my imagination.I remember a doctor saying”have you ever been stung by a ant”and then he vaccinated me and i started crying.I think thats how i got the fear of ants to the point where i dreamt of them
ok so when i ty to go to sleep i,m just like pls i wana be a werewolf in my dram and then, it only worked about 2 times so far. thats it
I absolutely loved the one about the wizards duel, bro that was awesome and the animating style was top tier.
Is anyone one gonna talk about how one of the dragons look like a dragon from chickn nugget.
I don’t have dreams
heres my trash dream: so i was in school, some how i was in 4th grade again, it was the last school day befor school was over for ever(dont ask) and my freind from 5ft grade just sneaked into my class acting like a doll, (somehow my teacher didnt see her-) and i was like:"oh, i wanna be a doll too!" and i randomly turned into a doll and left the classroom whit my freind and went out to play, then some old creepy sus heck KIDNAPPED ME while a was a doll, and he knew i was alive, he would do crazy things whit me (by the way i have anxeity so not that crazy) putting me down to the floor and then throw me up in the air, he also seemed like this sus old men in gacha vids where they kidnapp kids and do naughty things whit them (i wached it to hate it ok!) he didnt do anything, but when it was like a day in the dream he was getting ready to do naughty things to me, so i ran over to his brother, who was a very kind looking man, looked like he was 40 years old or something and poke his leg and said help (he was a colecter and colected stick's, poison's, buns, lidder's, and dolls) so he said he would help me and gave me some drinks and i just sat on hes colecting tabble(very messy) thinking: "should i really drink that poisen.." but then the old man was comming and i just fastly drank the poisen and became another type of doll that was small and was very difrent to doll me, it had like, a mouse head and tail, looked cute but creepy, and had this plastik eyes, and i just laid down looking like a normal doll of that type and the old man came to his brother and said: "hey, have you seen my doll" and he was like: "no?" but then the olld heck said "do you want this golden lighter added to your colection in another way" and the brother waas like:"HELL YEH!" but then the old heck set the colection table ON FIRE. while tiny me was on their, my head burned down, the nice man sawed me from burning fully down but then the hecky old crap snached me out of his hand and took me up to his face and said:"i feal like i know this doll.." while i was a centimeater away from bieng on his face, and yes i was TERRIFED! so his brother snached me back and said:"its my mouse doll naimed... poopyscott!" i was just looking at him headliss while my head not fully burned down just looked at him whit the rock face not understanding why the F_ he called me poopyscott!    THE END, pretty wierd right
Maaz just straight up dreamt of beating up a touridt!
I used to write my dreams down into my sketchbook, as some were very visual and could also be some great inspiration. But about a year ago, I stopped remembering my dreams, so I kinda had to stop, I don'tknow why. [EDIT]: So, not even one night after writing this comic I had a quite vivid dream that I remembered and wrote down. It even came with a furry side-plot!
When I was three batman became evil and killed everyone I knew and loved
You dream about being douced with mayonnaise by your friends and them leaving you

I remembered dreaming about a woman with white hair and red eys about 16 years old that can kill you with a glare
Animé
Ya’ll should’ve had somethingelseYT there
what's crazy is, they saw all of these faces. in a dream, everything you see has been seen irl as well. You cannot imagine a face unless you have seen it or are basing it off of a previous experience.
Same James😅
“Aquamannnnnnnnnnnnnnn”  -Jonny Depp
I have really weird dreams. (Sorry if it’s long) In the first one, I just had this one yesterday. All I remember is going to a shop and seeing a young woman. For some reason, I think I asked her for her Jean shorts (wtf) and she said yes (WTF) and she literally went into my car, and smiled, asking something that I forgot (btw she was always smiling when I was talking to her) and I woke up Another was about some kind of place you enter with idk pipes? It lead to a comforting place with toys and stuff? and it looked like a room. For some reason everybody knew about this place so my childhood friends went biking to the pipes (it was in our neighborhood) we then tried to get in but only I could because my friends were sitting in buckets to get in lol and I woke up later Another one is one that is really faint dream. I just remember going to a giant crystal market and museum that was also part grocery. Then a sumo wrestler came and yeah that’s all I remember Another was in some kind of city. I walked to a building with a bunch of people, and it looked like an airport. Then I think I knew what to do, and went to a seat. From across me was a 10-12 girl who had pimples and was probably crying because it hurt.  Lastly, a dream which took place in some kind of school, (presumably a high school) had idk weird students and stuff and when I went home I slept in a burrow??? The burrow then got destroyed and I don’t remember anything else. (Sorry I have a lot of weird dreams)
dragon tails dragon tai-. dragon jails dragon jails!

Latest dream I had in a long while just happend last night. There was a race with mario characters where a peach variant was sure to win the race what not was allowed for some reason while wario and mario battled for 2nd and 3rd place. So the weegee swoops in and blocks the camera of the finish line and because the camera did not see peach finish she did not win and the weegee went off on a two dimensional map while a three dimensional camera tries to follow it and it just got into a messy pixelated mess. Then the commenters where going to explain what happend and try to recap it of what just happend and what it will mean for the result and how this could have happend, you know the good stuff of a race. My doorbell rang and I woke up got up and out saw that nobody was there, checked the clock and saw it was half past four in the morning. Some a-hole woke me up from a dream for the first time in forever at least the last few years.
10:59 I like this style (aqua man too)
All dreams have meanings! So what does my dream where carl wheezer, black widow and some random little girl try to explore the spiral earth for alien women but got sent to prison by star trek ppl???!
I had a dream where my parents shot lasers out of their eyes and summoned Sid's toys from toy story to attack me.
What are the rules of War Tanks
She didn't do anything wrong

“There’s a  mysterious boss. Download the game to find out who they are” *literally shows that it’s the shogun puppet*
Abnormal Chaos's part was awesome!
My brother is terrifying to sleep near because while he’s sleeping he sits up and his head turns towards me
that’s all weird but this is my weirdest dream:  there was this naked pe at some sort of asylum and there head was just a giant eye ball. it was horrific. but the weird part was it was just a tv show i was watching even showed mom. this eye ball monster said something then it jumped of the balcony and scratched someone that someone then over a few days transformed into a a monster but a one and it infected more people but the new infected people were imprisoned by the 2nd monster to “study” but the first monster infected two other people and after a while the people turned into beautiful golden japanese dragons. me/the main character had a person that would sneak into the monsters hideout and live stream it all to me and the rest of my cult/gang/organization. then i was in china and one of the japanese dragons found me but didn’t attack me or anything but i/the main character found someone who i thought was my used to be friend so i went up to then and shit talked to them. but this person was actually the dragon that found me in china idk how i knew that but i just did. side story: around this point this guy went to the monster hideout and to the people that were still people he took of part of his skull and inside was the face of a baby and tried to get the people to think of a cure instead of making them worse….  real story: now im back at maimai’s house and we are all eating dinner then her dad comes home and he has been infected it looks like his face is being pulled off as it’s melting. i run out side then he runs after me and he turns into this dog like thing but all flesh and instead of a face or neck it was just a huge mouth with sharp teeth. then in the dream reality i pause the show that im watching on my computer and instantly wake up.  5:14am  NOTE: in my dream i was watching a tv show the weird part is i could see through the eyes of the main character and myself. also i was genuinely terrified and i woke up and both my legs felt completely numb.

I remember being on James’s bday livestream when he mentioned this vid idea lol that was like 2 years ago lol
I had a dream where I ate only one part of cake then suddenly I only drew the same character over and over again then there was a small Christmas Tree (it’s summer)

And this was 2 months ago
7:55 james: 😮👉  Maaz:👁👄👁

You almost made me cry at the pee part bc I still pee my bed
Now I’m imagining Maaz when he was writing “aquaman” in his Notes app, and he sleepily says “aquamaaaan” like Johnny Depp on that voice memo that played on the Depp/Heard trial
That couch at the beginning looked very familiar.
james x maaz heyeheyeheh

It's time to get up in the morning
Hello doctor Maaz  Thank you for the strangest dream I ever had  Picture the scene am lying in bed  My eye lids got heavy I am sleep The zzzzzz are flying ever where  So am wait in hospital waiting room  The doctor summons me into the office he dose the exam hmm and arhing  He then tells me am dieing  But surge will save me  So the nurse come in and get me into the wetsuit however they notice my toes are huge like fat carrots  They look aye each other  They say they might not be able to operate  They get the doctor back and once again he hmm and arhs  Telling me they can’t operate  I panic and freak out asking why as they where not going to operate on my toes  I awake in pure terror  Haha   Thank you for that the reason I blame cause your avatar was the doctor but in human form no eyes haha   But thank you amazing stuff

Time to get up song 13:39
That pot brownie story reminds me of something that happened recently lol. I was in my 3rd period class and I told one of my friends I was hungry then she pulled out a plastic bag that had 3 brownies in it and she already ate 2 and a half of them. She gave me the other half without telling me it had pot in it and after lunch I was all wobbly and I couldn't stand up. A lot of people noticed and carried me to the nurse and sadly she only got suspended for 3 days. She has not come back since then because she has gotten a lot of threats not from me but by some of the students who carried me to the nurse.
No eye
https://youtu.be/lVdUVa9dgEI?t=596   Why were you sleeping together? little strange.

Y’all have cool dreams mine are always really weird with no story to them

My dog peed in my bed
maybe when james busted out of dragon prison, when he woke up he was busting out of the dream, as well as the prison. so when he woke up, that meant he successfully escaped
I had a dream twice about a girl who was probably a japanese high schooler from the uniform and she had black hair in a ponytail and wore a completely white face mask and outside the two dreams I had of her I never saw her again
why were they making out in the cloud

How do people remember their dreams…
Ya know I had a weird dream where I was in this giant house everything was black and white except for me and these other kids that I was with. We were all wearing Halloween costumes I was dressed like a witch. We walked up the stairs and entered a room where we saw the blob thing, he was like this really weird thing and he was on a trampoline in my old backyard. I went on the trampoline and he offered me this pouch thing and told me to eat it. I asked what was in it and it said “ you don’t want to know…” I was very confused and he gave me a coin and he said put this into a slit in the ground on the top floor of the house and we just left through the gate and somehow we were back in the house I put the coin in the slit in the floor and then I tripped going down the stairs. When I got to the bottom and I had bruises scrapes and even broken bones because the stairs were wood. Everybody was saying “are you ok!?” In this very annoying high-pitched voice they all sound the same. Then I woke up. Would you guys say this is a nightmare a dream because I don’t know.
*sniff*
BELIVE me you don't want to know what I dream about I have some WEIRD dreams ( My fat dog with maracas )

Cinderella: A dream is a wish your heart makes! *Well James and Maaz’s hearts really made some really interesting wishes-*
My favourite story and artstyle were Pot Brownies but Aquaman style is nice to start with.
So, basically, James was playing dungeons and dragons..... with dragons...... in a dungeon 😐

Anyone else concerned that James had a furry dream lol
One time I had a nightmare where I was climbing a mountain and I saw a maze and when I was walking in the maze a bear was talking and chased me and got me the bear was like scratching my stomach and I felt it in real life and it was like really weird

MAAZ IF YOU IN MA SEVER PLEASE TELL ME YOUR UID

I had a dream few hours ago. So my dream was that it was my cousins bday (I watched The Amazing Race with my parents the other day so thats the cause) then we went on an adventure and I checked the list and it said d w o r m s and my dads blanket was on my legs so. My cousins bday gift was dWoRmS when we got home and the dWoRmS was climbing me, I WAS SCREAMINg shaking it off when it was my dads blanket that was tangled around me. I woke up and slept and forcefully made me dream about my dogs bday and we adventured and went to different areas of our country then we went home got my dog a chicken cake woke up and carried on.
Aquaman

Furry…prison?
WHY DOES HE GAVE NO EYES
Dang the animation of the wizard one was pretty cool  There’s probably a webtoon about something like that
I have this think that I call perfect dream memory so I can remember everything in great detail and can reinact it in my mind and I still remember dreams I had in year 4 and I’m in your nine now so I am above a dream journel
BRING BAL HOME BRING KOKO HOME
The dreams we have can sometimes be so random. One I had recently was when I was walking around a car dealership and there was this Lincoln LS that I sat in but for some strange reason it had the interior of a similar era Mazda3 including the steering wheel. Then I got into this State Trooper Dodge Charger and the brakes failed when I started it. I turned the wheel, went a whole turn in reverse and bumped extremely gently against the curb.
Who doesn’t dream about furry prison???
i refuse to write down my dreams. i personally don't want my sister to find my dream journal of me and shrek making out in a closet.
the second story sounds like a bnha fantasy au with izu as the rando
cockroaches can actually fly tho and thats the scary part
i want egg
Aqua man
Cheese
Not really a weird dream but In the dream I had more personality than most anime protagonists. I was constantly attempting to get a GF but never could because everyone knew that in the end, I would have to sacrifice myself to save the Earth and nobody wanted to put themselves through the trauma. I apparently also knew this, just like Earths entire population. We got the info of my sacrifice from an oracle that died after our info. Basically, I was on a team of "heroes", not superheroes, just heroes. We were destroying dark energy crystals that were popping up and causing chaos. You could tell it was a dark energy crystal because it was purple and had an aura to it. So after destroying some, we get an alert to strange mental phenomenons happening to everyone on Earth, caused by another crystal. This causes me to drive a mechanical cardboard box down a very long and abandoned road in my sleep.  Of coarse this happens right before I'm about to ask someone out so I was determined to get the crystals out of here. Some dude agreed to give us info on what was causing the dark energy crystals to pop up in exchange for taking something to his house. We agreed, and he gave us the info as well as these large 2 gallon bags full of color sorted Runts candy. Apparently some under the radar team was causing the chaos to gain power, and the only thing to stop the dark energy crystal making machine, was, you guessed it, a sacrifice. Luckily the enemy base was by the candy dealers house so we went on a stealth mission to avoid the enemy team and deliver the Runts. After we delivered the candy, we snuck into the enemy base and took out everyone besides the boss. The boss said that if we didn't kill ourselves now he would put the machine on overdrive and destroy sanity on Earth. This was my queue to jump into the machine and sacrifice myself. So I did, and then my dream ended. I don't know what happened after that, but this has been a reccuring dream, this being the second time it happened and each time growing in length. The first time it stopped at the road part, so I think I may just get the next part of the dream soon, but the dream only happens once every couple of months so don't expect an update with the rest of this story anytime soon. Hope you enjoyed reading this strange dream I had.
We almost got caught man! They would have jacked up my sentence!
I had a dream a few nights ago that I had a Walmart plastic bag with three plastic easter eggs in it that had real chickens inside.
I bet I could draw a better shark then you
I try to record my dreams as often as I remember them, and usually with a lot of detail, but unfortunately, most of my dreams I either don't remember, or they're way too nonsensical to even know what to write down.
James and furri prison be like
who saw the mayor give the middle finger
Maaz: and Sangonomiya Kokomi   My brain: .....     sam gonna be a cocoa bean XD

The egg dream honestly got me questioning Jame’s imagination limits
That one Dream from James is giving me some real Flumpty Bumpty vibes
These story’s have a lot of potential
Can you guys do a video of continuing the story from your dreams and imaging or describing how you’d want your story to go or how you’d think it’d go

Twist James girlfriend is TheAMaazing
last night, i had a dream that there was a team of sort of superheros and they wore eye masks (for ninjas) they were around my age (somewhere around 13-15) we started fighting this guy and then my mask came off and i tried to cover my eyes and go home to get another mask, then i looked on the internet and somebody figured out my identity. i wasn't really sure what to do about it and then i woke up
Imagine the odd1sout was in his sleep for 2 years if he had not busted out

I once had a dream bout a camp that was filled with children left and right cause it was so big, probably the size of a town,so one day a kid was in the laboratory,ok,so keep in mind that the kid is intelligent,it's night, he was making experiments, but suddenly someone came in asking for the results,the kid got distracted and slipped something, the person that came in accidentally touched the liquid,but they had a cut,they got infected and turned into  werewolf,next thing you know more people start getting infected and everyone is trying to evacuate to the buses,they get in, the werewolves behind them and they get on the road,keep in mind that they couldn't be seen(the werewolves and the children,and some adults) so they couldn't get help, so they trick the werewolves and manage to get rid of them for some time, they find a a building, the first one they saw after leaving the camp, went to one of the top floors, there were two apartments, gigantics, they went to the nearest one and banged on the door but to no avail, they went to the other one which was quite strange,it looked abandoned, they entered cause no-one was inside,the house was full of those thick blankets,pillow covers,bet sheets,sleeping bags and bed covering the floor,but what was strange was that even though it looked abandoned, everything was clean, they decided to hide in there cause time, they covered the windows with the blankets and used tape,which were in the counselors bags and covered the door with some pulled up beds and tape, they proceeded by getting altogether in the sleeping bags, blankets and beds, the werewolves finally found the apartment but didn't get them    Then I woke up.                      I was 5.

What
my theory of why you think your peeing is because your stuck in the dream trying to escape but it dosen't let you escape and dosent know what's happening outside so the brain thinks your on a toilet
Pt2
YES MORE GENSHIN IMPACT ADS
I once had a dream about flying glowing garlic in bowties and talking to a vampire
Kinda weird that Amaazing would dream of Genshin impact ad tbh
Running through my middle school full on naked, but parkour master like Vector and move like Tarzan.
It is kinda weird that Da AMaazing needs glasses despite the fact he doesn't have any eyes
Story time: so I have had multiple weird dreams, so here’s some I remember Dream 1: the field day. So I was at my school, and in this dream world called my stupid middle schooler brain, the school was different than my real school, and it was the field day at my school. So for the first few minutes it was fine but basically it was like possibly in Michigan without the death and stuff, and soon in the gym, which looked like a alley way, the intercom was like “ GET OUT NOW OR YOU WILL DIE!” And soon as I left the gym,  A BUNCH OF TOILETS FROM THE CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS BOOK CALE OUT! (I know it ain’t scary but I was like 8 at the time) eventually as I was leaving, my old friend, Arthur, did this crazy matrix backflip crap and then after that, I stole a blanket from a girl and went into a bus, Dream 2: The blizzard. So in my school again, I was doing stuff with my friends, doing weird things that adolescent 5th graders would do, and eventually the intercom in my school just all of a sudden goes and it says “DO NOT LEAVE THE BUILDING!” And then this is the part where I have to explain the map of the school in my dreams, so there’s the normal halls, then the school-Walmart border, then the giant dead mall where kids steal from the gum ball machine, then there’s the jail cells, and the spiraling office way, now me and my friends are stuck in here, now there’s 5th graders packed against the windows and basically a blizzard happens out of nowhere, I repeat, A BLIZZARD HAPPENS OUT OF NOWHERE IN GEORGIA, so basically now there is all the classes piling on clothes for warmth(?) And I remember one of the piles made my vision static, and eventually the food runs out and 3 months later into this blizzard and the class is on the sky deck just waiting, everyone is starving, dying, and sad. As the light fades into nothingness… as you are all alone in the world in your empty mind, you feel… Happiness… and sadness, you are nothing now… as you fade into the void known as your brain… The End.
I actually write my dreams when I remember what it was about, but most of my dreams are like epic? Not like in a fighting way but it's more that it looks like a movie. And I love to talk about my dreams, so maybe one day I'll present them (with drawings) but I'm kind of lazy =w=
Huh, i guess i can feel now that my dreams arent as weird as i think, at least compared to other people’s dreams
These guys really do be dreaming about dragons, magic and monsters and then there's me. The most interesting dream I can remember is one where I was having a lung surgery without anesthesia and for some reason, I was helping the doctor in the surgery because I didn't feel any pain.
Not the binary code on ur merch translating to MW- 😭 🤚 💀
I love that last egg dream
13:41
"Hi guys today we will be talking about dreams with the even twos inside"
Just saying: those sound like real stories (with Luigi I guess)
You're the person I saved you are was you wearing a cape for instance because I was I was a dragon saving someone with a cape with a sword and he said he hit a old woman so I helped him because I killed 17,000 people 1,005-0 * 1799 + 000 510015 * multiply by 650
okay bust like venti
That genshin impact game seems kinda cool actually , idk much about it but why do people hate it so much?
I don't blame him I did it 6 times when I was 9

You guys never seen flying cockroaches? Don’t come to Florida. We call the. Palmetto bugs and they are huge
Flumpty
My weird dream: lord comes back to Erath and slaps me in hell
That sofa looks oddly familiar and sus
I have this really annoying reoccurring dream like every month or something we’re this STUPID GIANT gorilla (monke fan speaking here) was throwing  barrels down a yellow hill at me and my mums with giant versions of personal objects I own at the sides.The first time I had this dream was when I was like 5 (I was scared like hell and still kind of am) and I’m now 12 before this I never knew what donkey Kong is until I was six.This won’t be seen but ye
Yes, cockroaches do fly. Come to Florida sometime, you; 'll be traumatized when one flies into your hair.
I just had a weird nightmare, I guess my family were like appartment servents or something, then there was this lady who had a pet pig and dog, had her little grandson and her husband. So I went to her room for something if she needed anything, she was nice at first with semi normal conservation. Then it started to get weirder, I suddenly felt very uncomfortable around her. So I ran away from her and went to one of my brother's, which he was with his friend's. Then the lady had an axe and was abt to kill my mom, I stopped her and took her axe.I called my brothers to get her out...Most of my nightmare's contain my family members diying or close to dying, usually my mom and aunt(Though that aunt that was in my nightmare's, actually committed suicide irl so...) Anyways, I guess my most nightmares are abt how I'm worried for my family members. Also funny thing, I have a dream catcher and it's supposed to help you basically catch nightmares....Didn't catch this one.
i havent ever written down a dream, but i remember one from a super long time ago when i was like, 5. i used to have a babysitter and i had a dark hallway with a sharp turn around a corner in my house. we used to play a game where me, my sister, or my babysitter would go around the corner and try to be scary and all that, like pretending to be dragged around the corner and stuff. one night, i had a dream that we were playing that game, until i noticed, hey, wait a minute, if my sister and my babysitter are right next to me, then who is behind the corner? and then immediately something terrifying for me at that age ran at me at light speed. i never played the game after that.
simply due to the fact that he took a sponsorship from a terrible company such as genshin impact, i went from "oh who is this" to "i fucking hate this guy"
The sleep paralysis one is TERRIFYING
I have really wack dreams. I dreamed up an entity I call "The Sock Spider". A giant sock with spider legs coming out of the rim of the opening, covered in a brown-grey burlap texture. It kidnaps people, and has been in a few recurring dreams. This guy is among one of the less strange dream elements.
Hi Maaz, I really like your videos and I would like to know what free program should a starter in animation use? Thank you for inspiring me, Lucas
I can control my self in my dreams and I tell theme that they are not real
AAAAAAAAAH WHY DID PARTY DAVE MAKE WIZARD DUEL SO FRICKIN GOOD
Moral of 2nd story: do not try something if you dont know anything about it
DO ANOTHER MAAFIAAAAA

Don't mind me, just making a whole universe and lore to go with the second dream with the wizards
Dude u should sooo put in Bryson/ Haminations for the next episode of maafia for Maafia 3
Maafia 3 🥺
NOT MY PRECIOUS BOI LUIGI-
9:20 I once had a dream about cockroaches… it was *weird* very weird So I’m just messing around and being really loud and my dad is like “shhh… your going to wake up the cockroaches!” I’m just like “IM SORRY… THE WHAT!?” And I’m just freaking out cause cockroaches are gross. All of a sudden millions of cockroaches come out of the ceiling and start flying at us and kind of attacking. In between the door to outside is like a small hallway with a greenhouse thing and then the door to outside. For some reason I go to that small hallway and I’m barely able to close the door before cockroaches can get out and instead of going outside like a normal person, I just stand there when more cockroaches come and fly at me. As soon as one touches me I wake up. 11:11 I also had a dream where I ended up peeing myself in bed Me and my cousins (3 of them, their very young. One was 9 at the time, one was 4 at the time and one was 2 at the time) were in this weird log cabin shop thing. There is a glass display case thingy, you know what I’m talking about. Well that thing is displaying lots and lots of rubber duckies. I really had to pee but for some reason I needed to choose one. I quickly ran to the bathrooms that were very far away but also directly behind me. When I’m about a quarter of the way there I pee myself in my dream and I set the bed irl.
One of my weirdest dreams was my mom dying by a bunch of weird sandwich cars with like Olive Wheels there might have been regular come to think of it I didn't remember it was years ago I was like five but we had just came back from grocery shopping and she just fell backward and got ran over and it was so f****** weird
owo send me to furry prison
this just a question. in some of ur vids why do u pull out that finger.
'its time to get up its time to get up its time to get up in the morning its time to get up its time to get up its time to get up today HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA'  also that dream were you were in dragon prison was the best dream ever.  i had this one dream were i was in a box, and i was with two dogs, the dogs were named bread, and roll. roll only had two legs and bread had no tail. so i saw a chest, and opened it, and the missing limbs of the dogs were inside, i stuck the limbs back to the dogs and we escaped out of the door. i have know idea why.
The depiction of the egg dream is terrifying props to the person who animated that
why is flumpty in your dream
13:38 im currently sick but i dont think ive laughed this much before
Damn Zootopia tiger 💁
You are so cool
party dave is the one i want to see more of

Happy ramadan kareem

hi Maaz, you probably wont see this or care but we actually have the same birthday! ain't that wacky
Omg the Wizzards Dream's storyboard is so good ;u;
Hippity hoppity your plot is now my property

The second dream should become a show or web toon
13:32 You ever heard of a Vermicious Knid before?

Are we gonna ignore James  dreaming about that creepy egg
I love the game so much too
0:35 why
HE DID EYES :0
Oh, okay...
i don't play genshin impact
So James you commented on a video with you in it... "I like your plans."
I remember one and only one dream in detail, and I can’t remember any other dreams, even when I have just woken up, it make my sleep mild and boring
weird
also the ayako and venti banner is out
I like the monster dream art style the best.
Maaz: YAE MIKO CAN ABSOLUTLEY STEP ON ME   Me: Yes.
When james mentioned his pot brownies dream I was reminded of something that happened at my moms work. My mom works at a school and helps around the place and she said that one day there was this 5th grader who was caught selling weed brownies in the bathroom.I don't know what happened after wards
Jokes aside I think you guys had one of the coolest dreams I've ever heard... lol It's even cooler that you can remember every detail
Go to 0:21 i’m look at The judge finger
okay that Wizard Duel animation @ 4:28 was AMAZING
Did anyone else know that maaz doesnt draw eyes on his characters for religious reasons,in islam u will have to bring life to the characters with eyes in judgement day and they will torture u
I just watched an ad for the same thing ur advertising for
When are your first video remake comingour
💜
Ok
One time I had a dream an Italian mob boss ghost  wanted to make me his wife, but to make me his wife he had to kill me and I had to find subtle and polite ways to say no to things like poison or beheading and also the wedding dress I had to wear was very uncomfortable and it looked like the one Lydia Deetz wore in Beetlejuice
Hi Maaz! I am a big fan of you! I am also a Muslim. I have 1 request. Can you make a video where you show what you use and how you create animations? Please. I also want to animate like you. It will help me a lot
My weirdest dream/nightmare:          So, there was a tornado outside and next to my sofa, there's this like electric box, and we can put things on top of it, nothing was on it and I was sitting on there really worried. I saw a girl, who held a sponge which somehow controlled the tornado and silently freaked out in my mind as she passed by. When she finally got past I accidentally banged and she came back. Somehow, the door was UNLOCKED and she waltzed on in, then she rubbed the sponge in my face, which I will say is rude, and I just fainted, I woke up, she still had no emotion, before she rubbed it in my face again and I just died. I told my friends about this dream recently and they all laughed at me ( and the dream, like, how did I die like that ) and after I " died " I woke up in fear and was just like, ' What the fu** just happened '
One time i knew I was in a dream but had no powers and was sad
10:30 got a Sonic Adventure 2 reference (preach)
I had several dreams being attacked by insects. Pretty sure that’s true for a lot of people
ANIMATION BE GUD. GJ Story Board teams!
Happy Ramadan

13:40  I need lyrics of this   13:46 HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa

Why is it when ever a YouTuber comments on a video everyone goes crazy and comments

Theirs a fever dream I remember having when I was suffering from Pneumonia. I was dead and for some reason my organs were spread around the city in glass containers connected to machines and because I was spread out across the city, and my pieces were attached to this tech. Because I my bits were all contained and hooked up and became the City and I forced the city to fly into the sky. I think might have been planning to kill the world or something as this sentient floating city but I woke up before I could see where I was going with it

I had this nightmare where this lady was executing people and she shot me but I did not died/wake up yet I was numb, vision was blurry, and I fell backwards but she threw me in one of those machines that is razor sharp and suppose to cut wood so this machine slowly took me to where those sharp cutting things are and I can hear it make noise and I was getting closer and closer to it but I woke up while vividly hearing the sounds echo so closely.
most people find it hard to lucid dream but i lost the ability to have normal dreams and i can now only lucid dream, its very enjoyable
I can’t stop laughing. I’m laughing so much from that last dream to the point that I’m crying.
I saw the thumbnail and saw the creepy egg and it reminded me of a recurring nightmare I used to have about this evil raw egg that would chase me around and for some reason I was terrified of it and my FRIEND left me for DEAD
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In my opinion Genshin Impact is a rip-off of Zelda breath of the wild.
eg
*A Q U A M A N*
0:35 WHO EVEN ADDED THAT DETAIL!
The Aquaman  is just aquaman siting in front of you
0:35 Kinda sus
Sorry but I don’t play breath of the weeb
Bruh something tell me why the first half devolved from full animation to animation without coloring to just the rough draft of a an animation.
Anyone gonna talk about the nightmare egg?
Imma share some of my own dreams.  So for the first one I was in the bathroom, and my dog, for some reason, was taking a bath in the toilet. Then my mom walked in sat on the toilet, and peed and pooped, right there in front of me, while the dog was still in the toilet. I was SCREAMING at my mom to stop, but then she flushed the dog down the toilet like he was a frickin goldfish. I literally woke up crying so loudly but now its one of the funniest dreams I've ever had.  There was one dream from when I was in elementary school. A lot of my classmates were there as well. Suddenly everyone but me were turned into various animals. I distinctly remember one kid being a bever and another being a woodpecker. It began to snow and the woodpecker began to cry because he had to fly south for the winter. So, I kid you not, we all went on a quest to stop winter from coming just so woodpecker kid would be happy. I didnt even like the irl woodpecker kid a whole lot he was mean.  For some reason I had glasses (i don't irl) and I was at the beach. The waves were like 10 feet tall at 50mph so i was not haveing fun. In order to not lose my glasses, i gave them to my mom before the waves grabbed me again. The moment I got back onto the beach, a strange tall woman with black hair said "this doesn't seem like the place for you," grabbed me by the arm, shoved me in her black car without windows with my friends whom she had also kidnapped, and drove us to a tiny poluted beach. The sand was black and slimy, there was trash everywhere, and a hermit crab used a can as a shell. Never got off that beach.  In this next dream, i wasn't myself. I was seeing through the eyes of another person, i don't remember what her nane was. Anyways she wanted to adopt a dog, but the nearby shelter only had small dogs, and she wanted a big one. When she asked the person working there why there weren't any big dogs he said the big dogs were very aggressive and dangerous. Upset, this girl snuck into the shelter at night and went to the back of the shelter where the big dogs were. After one of them tried to bite her hand off, she realized all the dogs were actually mixed with wolves, for some reason. She released all of the dogs, big and small, to run wild and cause chaos. She also befriended one of the big dogs.  Again, this next dream wasn't from my pov. The character was an elemental being who could control time. He had a shapeshifting partner. He wasn't the only elemental being, there were a lot more like him with different elements, meant to keep the world at peace. This fire guy (cuz it ALWAYS has to he fire) was being very mean and causing chaos, so this main character had to stop him. On their way to the big bad base, the main character and his shapeshifting companion were ambushed by a lot of other shapeshifting creatures (btw, all of the shapeshifting creatures have an elemental "master") they captured his companion but he himself got away. He then had to rescue his companion, but found it very hard to find where he was being held, so he rewinded time and let himself get captured as well so he knew were it was. He and his companion escaped and confronted bad guy, only to find out the actual guy was innocent and his shapeshifting parter had been impersonating him the whole time.  I have a lot more dreams, but these are the ones i like the most and remember the most about.
Watching this reminded me of a dream my mom had about me and my younger sibling. She was forced to send us to a school and we were given uniforms and weren’t allowed to leave the school once entered. My mom had a bad feeling about the school so she came to it to find a horrifying scene where all the students were lined up on the cement next to the school lawn. Apparently there was an entity the school was built on where anyone who would walk on the lawn would get instantly eaten. And by that I mean the floor would open like a mouth and this tentacle like limb or something would grab the kids that were on the grass and drag them into this grey, lifeless void. Where time seems to not exist, and the corpses would just float there. So my mom decided to rescue me, my younger sibling, and all the other kids that were there and all she told us was to run. She saw us escape by jumping the fence, and then she woke up.
I like the game to
I wet myself at the egg
aquaman
One of the strangest dreams Ive had was that time I dreamt of playing in the snow. My dad (in the dream) pushed some snow towards me, and it just grew into this TSUNAMI of snow. I just got buried, absolutely buried. And then, I realize I couldnt breathe. My brain starts to realize that its a dream, and that I literally couldnt breath irl. Then I woke up. Turns out I just rolled over on my face, so, uh, that split second before I woke up I just thought I was gonna die
0:04 oh no,the images, THEY'RE COMING BACK A-
I love the egg
When maafia 3?
I had a dream where I was about to defeat thanos with a spatula but my mom Woke me up

To have exiting and creative dreams like this would be... well, a dream come true, except in the dream. Like elemental wizards!?! Once I did lucid dreaming tutorials every weekend for like a month to get those types of dreams. It didn't even work! I had one moment where I noticed I was asleep when I saw a dream forming and got all exited and thought "this is it," then all I saw was black and I opened my eyes and was like "dandit!"
IT'S TIME TO GET UP IT'S TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNING ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP ITS TIME TO GET UP TODAY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 13:40

Mine would always took in a same place, which is the mix of my elementary and senior high's one and I always the one that could only talk through my mind or telepathy. Also, only a few that knew what I was thinking among all of my friends that happened to be there (which is almost everyone)
We all know YOU didn't animate your dreams, your animators did
Why are the minds of YouTube always the most insane  Ah because they never leave the house  And are always animating
0:44 please don't touch that number my eyes were destroyed and your eyes will be destroyed to if you see this
6:47 so mean freezing her when she just wanted to see a naturally formed body of water.
Is this the first time Mazz has cursed in the channel
No Amaazing take him to Furry Prison school
How do you guys have cool dreams. i have dreams about eating grilled cheese sandwiches
Colab with me
I had a dream where I was on a nice beach with my mum, stepdad, and sister, and then we decide to go on a walk. After walking for a while, I look down and realise we are on a mountain, and promptly fall a very long way to my death. I woke up halfway through the fall.
I got my ingrown toenails removed, I can barely walk I’m in so much pain
Whenever I am going to the bathroom in my dreams I immediately wake up and go to the bathroom.
I love "Wizard Duel", it's my favourite out of all.  And just, gotta love the alien girl, she's like a gender-swap version of Gojo from Jujutsu Kaisen xDDDDD or at least that's how I imagine her.
Bro when Amaazing laughed he sounded like guitar
James you lil....
I think I can depict what both of your dreams mean:  Mars, your dream about the alien girl, shows that you are encountering something unknown and frightening. And you need to know what to do with that problem. And you are using magic to fight her. Magic means that you were using your energy to accomplish something without effort or difficulty. James, your dream with dragons and being in a jail cell indicates some kind of restriction, Maybe by your own emotions or by somebody else's personality or actions. Dragons and dreams are complex symbols, but they symbolize as a passion and chaotic beliefs which we must come to terms.  And that weird dream about the egg, is a symbol of unrealized potential and possibilities yet to come. I hope this helps!
What if you wrote down your hallucination
My dad is weird he says a guy peed in his pants🧈
I love how Dream Odd1sOut's first thought when his little sister took drugs was to prepare them for the high and not like take them to the hospital or something.
I liked rush light invaders
3:03 me I'm going to stay with my cookies pls my sea fairy is all most 1 star
"  dragon prison seems am azing as hell!" - a      WOF fan
Ayooo

why do u guys hav awesome dreams well i just hav stupid dreams
i have hit the bell and are now a super maartian
I had a dream where I was getting married to the monkey princess and I lost the banana bouquet. Then, I found it inside a railroad that was conveniently placed right next to the monkey princess’s mansion. Like it went from beautiful green land at the mansion, to the wasteland at the railroad. I never ended up marrying the monkey though 😔
So that one dream was just about being racist to aliens.
13:40 my new alarm😂😂
I feel so bad for that mana mage girl
This is very funny
2:57 Don't drop the Soap!
THAT EGG MAN DREAM JAMES HAD, i might have NIGHTMARES-
The egg one was funny af idk why lol

Maafia and timmy
And your vids are just mmmmm
JAMSS AND RUSH AND MAAZ YALL ARE MY IDOLS becauae you guys are cool and have so many subs and are probably taller than me lol
:) i luv dis vid idea
Aqua man
In one of my dreams I saw a trailer for a animated movie of a fat jaguar rolling over in his sleep. Which caused space time to get distorted in a way that made the earth rotate the other way. Idk who the main characters were but they needed to find the Jaguar to role over again. As time moves backwards which deages everyone on the world.   I kinda want that to be animated now. Anyone who has contact to Disney, this is the movie they need to make.
12:42 this line is criminally underrated
its time to get up in the morning.  =)
Nobody gonna talk about James sleep paralysis egg demon?
JAMES DREAMED ABOUT FLUMPTY
We need more maafia
You’d have a joyride with animating my dreams I even been writing them down for almost a year  I sadly stopped :(
Can You Do A Few Voice Lines For My Video
I love genshin impact I have bein playing it for a cupel of years
Bro why do u make people blind :)
I've had this weird dream pretty recently. I was on my way home, then i see this Michael Jackson looking guy, i snapped a picture & sent it to my friend, then my friend texted back that it wasn't Michael Jackson but it was Muzan (from Demon Slayer), and he slit my throat right after, but i was still alive somehow. So a few days later, I assembled a team and we beat the living crap out of Muzan. I didn't remember all the team members, but I knew Fred from Scooby Doo was one of the team members, so I assumed the rest of the team members were the Mystery Inc (Shaggy, Scooby, etc). TL;DR I survived an attack from Muzan and assembled the Mystery Inc, successfully got my revenge.
Shit, i have strangest dreams

0:44 If I had a nickel for every time I’d seen Maaz ship himself with James, I’d have two nickels.  …Which isn’t that much but it’s weird that it happened twice, right?
James's reaction to the gension impact sponsor is just the best
The egg dream is Actually a game
Oh i had a dream like i was a big villains butler and there was other. Big villains. I also caught some prisinors. And there was human maids . Those Human maids didnt rlly understand the villain new creature stuff. Btw the butler i was is an charachters au i made in my mind but didnt draw
i once dreamed that i was on a very tall tree and i fell and turned into a gargoyle
This game really has a lot of Impact on your mental health.
It says your redemption code is invalid. I don't think it's expired, it would say so...
Gen shin impact actually sucks (that’s my opinion)
Ok problem I don’t want to have more vivid dreams cause like NIGHTMARES. I don’t have reoccurring ones or anything but my nightmares are fucking scary as hell to me and to make that a more vivid and lively experience would be like punishing myself
I loved James's dream about the monsters and how the animator added in Venom
i like PartyDave
No one commenting on chibi Maaz & James making out?!? Starts when Maaz says “in my dreams…” lol!!
there goes a sponsorship with James
I luv your animation :3333
My weirdest and strangest dream was when my little brother murdered a three-year-old in a garage with a screwdriver... yeah.. Also, I need to know what Aquaman was about.
I had a dream that was kind of like a video game. It was located in a wooden building and there was a giraffe. You had to throw the giraffe into a chair until it was inside the chair. Then you had to extend its neck because it’s neck was extremely short. And then you made it play the bongos. Another dream I had remembered ever since I was 5. There was a giant ant and it asked me to be it’s friend. Then we went to it’s house and I went in the bathroom. Then the giant ant came in and ate me. I then saw all red with a human skull. When I woke up I then realized why it had no friends.
This was my favorite video
James rallson
Couldn't they add some color to the animations?
Its funny that in The withard duel maaz calles The 911 after waking up
"This is a dream I had and its a dream called" (ad) Im maKiNG waFFleS!!!!
Lol
Egg demons are everywhere
Maaz: *Hypes up genshin impact* Me: does it have character creation? Maaz: ... Me: this game doesn't deserve to be alive
I swear I’ve heard “it’s time to get up, it’s time to get up in the morning” before
I had a dream, where, over the course of many misadventures, I repeatedly encountered an anthropomorphic dinosaur lesbian power couple that had the ultimate goal of making their humble one-floor home the ultimate party haven where anyone could hang out as long as they respected others. The couple was Ciera the Triceratops and Dina the T-Rex. By the end of the dream, I took shelter in their home from a madman to find that they had achieved their goal and the place was full of partying creatures and humans.
I had lost all my respect when u mentioned genshin inpack
I had a dream about Minecraft dragons but all the dragons where white and they were in the myth nation and I had to protect them along with TinyTurtle (a YouTuber)and one nightmare I had that was reoccurring was thing 1 and thing2 from the cat in the hat knows a lot about that were on a merry go round and my hands were shrinking and yes I know I'm weird but believe me these dreams were on another level of weird
I don't have dreams all I see is darkness
me watching dis vidio: what the fuck?
you should of said: play genshin impact to become a child preditor and never take a shower again
My favorite reoccurring dream that I haven't had in many years is slipping on a banana peel, and that's it. (For more, just click read more lol)   I have only ever had a couple repeated dreams in my lifetime. There was this one dream that got repeated at least 6 times, but has not happened in years which is a shame since I really love the dream. I'll set the mood. It's a dark, pitch black room. There is nothing, but pure black. You look down and see a banana peel (like the type you would see in mario kart). You proceed to immediately slip on the banana peel and wake up. (When you slip you genuinely feel like you are falling even once you woke up) That's it. That's the entire dream; you see a banana peel, slip and then wake up.  This is my absolute favorite dream for literally no reason, but I loved seeing the banana peel and being able to go like "YOOO ITS THIS DREAM!!" for 0.0001 seconds before waking up.
Well I don't have dreams
One time i had a dream where i was at my aunts house and but the backyard was just a grassy hill. Me and my brother found a tub or bucket with some money and we took it. Then we go inside BUT there was no doors anywhere. Even the one we just came from. And then a really fast leech just popped in and suck out all my older brothers blood then it charges at me. Then i woke up
They can fly
My most recurring dream theme involving big high tide waves, just beaches, and pools, and sometimes getting smack at it or hanging out at the bottom of the pool during a flooding. And depending how long the wave come, I can get over that event and carry on with the dream or wake up. I want a wizard battle in my dream, only form of epic battle is punching the bad guy lol
Dragon prison sound nice *coughs in wing of fire fan*
5:43 “he breaks out of furry prison”
"talking as your wetel broder" maz can can i have some berawnis
that egg will forever traumatize me
I think the egg monster would be a daily flamingo video.
Maaz's dream about wizards is definetly interesting they should make an anime about it.For what i think..
i'm so freaking terrified of the giant egg
dude what’s it like to actually have dreams. idk what the heck is up with me, but when i go to sleep, nothing happens, i just wake up the next day. so when i do wake up, i pretend to be asleep, and make up my own dreams. how the heck do i fix that—
This is what i ended up watching at 4 am. I'm a lucid dreamer and i remember most of my dreams. i should probably try writing them down, but i'm too lazy to write something that could end up taking an entire 10 pages per dream.. that's how much i remember them!
I know of lucid dreaming and s tuff, but my problem is that I can't change the dream even if I know that it's a dream.
"its time to get up, its time to get up, its time to get up in the morning, its time to get up, its time to get up, its time to get up today, hahahahahahahahaha"
:0 fantastic XD also What the crazy,  and idk life. X3
Can you make another mafia vid please. It’s so amazing! 😂🤣😂🤩
Like the nerd i am I’m playing zelda
I don't dream often but there are a few nightmares I remember I had yrs ago and I typically am able to remember the dreams throughout the day buy ofc I won't remember as many details as I do in the morning.
i had dream i was being chased by moondrop
i can lucid dream
ima furry
I liked, subscribed, and hit the bell I'm a super maartian
I had a dream of a abusive teacher but turns out he was just a glitch-
i like theart of the firstone
Mazz why holding all that cake :)
I just want to say that my weirdest dream was at 6 years old and it was me up on the clouds and spat out rainbows and it just went like that for 50 minutes until big unicorns came to take my hair off and then they tried to make the world all colourful and happy and then there were two girls considered angels followed me around and i had a 3rd person view and then i kinda just fell into space and dropped and suffocated and then floated straight down it was kinda scary but when i touched near the atmosphere i kinda just woke up and wanted to continue the dream but couldn’t for some reason
I had a dream where i was chased around a playground at 3am by a red-eyed GoCompare man.
This came out on my birthday!
THE EGG DREAM HAD ME LAUGHING TOO HARD
HEY WAIT A SECOND that PARTICULAR COUCH.     `hmmmm`
love this type of video
Auqaman
Thought that boss was sasuke's sussano
poor luigi
That ending scene is gold
I had a dream where there was a doll army chasing me
that magic fight was very well animated woah
twice i just walked to my brothers bed wen he was sleeping then i peed on his bed
I'd recognize that black couch anywhere.
Define the work "pot brownies"
My brother read the wimpy kid book
Fun fact some cockroaches can fly. Also one time I woke up from a cockroach scurrying across the kitchen counter and I struggled to catch it and and heard it scurry again and I almost vomited. (I got it eventually) this wasn't a dream btw
Okay so are we not going to talk about in the sponsor that kitchen impact totally ripped off Naruto AKA Sasuke's susano I mean come on are you serious
Raiden shougen or whatever idk has this big purple arm looks like susano to me
oh so this is what normal dreams look like? Or well one of those times where you dont have a night of no dreams... I know some impressive ones. But my dreams are weird.  In a horrible nightmare way. Or just moral dilema or other weird things.   from burning alive.  To indignation from getting billed too while just talking to someone getting a manucure in a mall. Like why was i billed too?  To crumbling tile ceiling that crushes you in a classroom.  To hosting foreigners in my house. Then had a lot of fun then got worried they might steal from me? But didn't happen. So they were leaving and going next door. And somehow they convinced me to tear open the walls. Leaving a wooden room in the wall. Looking decrepit filled with clothes lines of random objects. And it was pretty fine... Was confused as too who my neighbour was again but heh. THen later noticed there was a staircase going down... And i got curious and more dread as i walked in the cold room. Watching down to see clutter and dead angles everywhere. But most importantly. More staircases. It keept going on multiple levels... Got scared and considered sending the foreigners there and lie that its "safe". See what happens. I got more and more worried what was living there and couldn't use police tape to the door. That wouldn't stop anything. But couldn't find any objects to block the entrance so i was in dread. Also my mind was slowly realizing... Im in a single house. No appartments. that wall should be outdoors and not this room. And it keept getting worst as then i questioned more who the foreigners that convinced me to do this was...  Or other dreams were a crow is talking to me. And very very compelling... I was very convinced... But yea. It sounded shady as hell. Whatever your thinking it was probably more shady. And ive heard a lot of stories from the hospitals i was a patient at. And i heard some sketchy story and horror stories. So yes. It was a shady crow.  guess i got weird dreams like these by the dozens or hundreds. But at least i don't have night terrors anymore.  But those are some of the more tamed dreams. But hey my death rate in dreams lowered so good things.   I wish everyone good health and pleasant dreams.
Can I tell a dream
I wanna go to dragon prison 🥺
13:42
13:30 *Flumpty.*
Maafia part 3 plz
I like party daves art stile
Why does gendhin impact remind me of legend of Zelda?
Turns out the egg monster was telling James to wake up so he doesn’t pee in bed
well i had a dream about the splatoon 3 splat lands back in 2018 before it became a realty! also punched cultulu in the face and stole his spaceship! tamed scp-173! made freddy krueger my gardener! literally grabbed chucky the evil doll by the face and head like broly from the old DBZ movies and then smashed him into a broken mess! punching something so hard the the earth fell into the sun! crushing things so hard they turned into black holes! truing into the hulk from marvel and then smashing thanos into a crippled mess! fighting in the second pokemon world war! also pokemon in space! humans invading from a mars colony in splatoon 4-6! being the x-com main commander against alien invasions! and so much more!

I died at the egg dream lol
Goku style
Bro at 13:22 is one of James dreams.  It cracks me up! 🤣
Last week I just thought about noting my dreams down on my phone. I didn't know other people do that too, that's interesting. Also the first dream that started it was about me and Jaiden drawing stuff together on paper. It was wholesome and I loved it so much I wrote about it on my phone. I also once woke up in the middle of the night with an idea for a movie that thanks to my phone being under my pillow I could write down aswell.
10:36 best art stile
HOW DO YOUR DREAMS MAKE SO MUCH SENSE
I have a dream every year where like the world is a wasteland and it’s full of mutants and we have to fight em off and somebody such as my cousin or anybody ik is there with. Me helping
Why did the egg-thing in the last story crack me up so much!? X,D
RushLight Invader was my favorite art style in this video, I liked how they did kind of a play on words with some of the things like the ray was a sting ray and stuff like that
Best video ever
I had the same dream as James!! Its scary how similar the premise is to mine just no dragons. They were my closest friends and family instead. Also the cages where small and only used to bring people to the big field room
I remember i  had a dream that i was behind a carnival and there was like 4 people in furry costumes but with no fur, and there was one of my cousin. In the top of the "screen" it says Hide before Vanny (from SB) comes. I hid in a dumb hiding spot and then i didnt get caught, but 2 of the random people and my cousin got caught. Soo me and the other random people have to find them. And then we teleported in a bush maze and in front there was a boss fight. Then one of the random people said "i don't wanna go there" and then the other random people said "ya me too" And i said "same". "Then.. wake up!" The random person said, then both of them said it and then i woke up
I LOVE PartyDave's own!
The couch in the beginning triggers my mind
Does anyone else nearly get to sleep and hear a sound in your dream then wake up
7:32   Hold on..? I had a dream like that but we got abducted instead when we were at a dinner place and water and stuff everywhere at the centre of the city or something we got kidnapped and turned into monsters lmao

Y genshin not on Xbox
*Ohmyfuckinggodthelastone.*
I wrote my dreams down for a while and one night I had a dream where I was in a school I didn't recognize, and at some point I realized I was in a dream and I called the dream itself out on it, so my subconscious made a physical manifestation as a ball of dark matter about as big as a yoga ball and floated there, edging slightly closer to me for about a second before switching scenes and making me forget.  Yo, that was terrifying.
Congratulations on your relationship with theodd1out you kiss him

Odds egg dream is leaked one night at flumptys 4 gameplay
I turn most my dreams into stories in my head after i wake up and if i like them (which is 90% of the time) then i reallyyyy want to write them and that's why my mind is so full all the time and is bursting with ideas aaaand yeah XD
Eyes
For two weeks straight, I had the same dream where it was just an anchor in a white void. No sound, No movement, just the anchor and the void and I don’t know how to explain it other than that.
I had a nightmare that was less of a nightmare but more of a really weird dream. So I was in my elementary school playground and saw this... odd and bloody red monster. I proceed to walk towards it and run away while screaming Harambe... I was a weird guy.
AMaazing's wizard dream: Him fighting Princess Kaguya. Odd1sOut evil ray dream: The entire plot to One Punch Man season 2.
Five nights at Flumpty's 4 !?1?!?1?!?1
I’ve had this reoccurring dream of me sitting in a pure white room eating a bowl of like cheerios but instead of milk it has water and I’m eating it with a fork but one night I couldn’t lift the fork out of the bowl and I just started trembling and crying
This video made me realize how boring my dreams are. Most of mine are ordinary everyday things such as being at school or furniture shopping.
I've had the strangest dreams over the years, but TheOdd1sOut rallying dragons to break free of prison trumps most of them
I always have dreams about dragons
I don't end the bill like that I want to see you and James then you know what I mean the party
FLUMPTY BUMBTY IS THAT YOU?
The animators slayed legut
Is it "ta vat?" Or "tay vat?"
Funymony is best one
I only clicked this video because of the egg monster in the thumbnail
Not to long ago I dreamed about me and my best friend in a zombie apocopalypse and my best friends stabbed me with a crobar
That egg dream is very disturbing ngl
Don't worry James I had night terrors for years on end and every time it was  really scary either pooped or peed
Dream I had a few years ago that made no sense:  Me and my friend were ghost in a shopping mall complex thingie parking lot roaming around  But then out of nowhere I got teleported to my school and I was sitting in the hallway waiting for the bus and when I got on I saw a different friend of mine, but they weren’t my friend when I was at that school in real life cause they didn’t go to that school.   Then the bus took me somewhere and teleported away then I went into a little shack with my friend and asked them “What’s my condition?” And they said “You are dead” but I got mad because of course I’m dead I’m a ghost and stormed out while my friend was still in the shack  Then I was in the war fighting against sentient broccoli with guns and I had to hide underground so they wouldn’t hurt me.  Dream 2: I was in a video game with a friend and we were having fun but the game was super glitchy, we found a npc that was completely blacked out but when we got close it did the attacking animation expect it didn’t move.  My friend logged out of the game so I did the same but then I went back in the game but then the end credits started playing but everything was a buggy mess  The dream cuts to a streamer playing the game legitimately and before they beat the game they open their character menu but there is a shadow thing behind their character in the menu and when they exit the menu it pops out of the character screen and kills their in game character and the webcam cuts off  Dream 3:  I was a kid in my backyard and there was a genie but it had no shape yet I could still tell it was there and sitting on top of a kiddy slide and it had a evil smile and was keeping me prisoner but still granting my wishes  One of my friends( none of which were people I actually knew) came and tried to save me with water guns but the genie used it’s powers to turn the kids into nothing but blood on the grass.  I challenged the genie to a fight and I won somehow so it promised to revert what it did. The genie lied though since my friends didn’t come back. When I went into the newly appeared door to inside the house of which the backyard was in, I saw two people who were my dream parents.  I looked at the photos on the wall and noticed how all the pictures of them had no face and when I went to go look at the parents they had no face so I ran back into the backyard and the door disappeared.  The backyard had one of those kiddy kitchen play sets so I tried to distract myself by playing with it but when I opened the cabinet blood poured out and onto the grass staining it with even more blood.  I pulled out my phone to try and get rid of the genie by searching it but it took control of my phone and forced it to glitch out so I couldn’t search anything then I woke up
Dragon Jails, Dragon Jails..
Not Jack Spicer being at the front of the villain's scene 😂 I didn't think anyone remembered Xiaolin Showdown.
Con CD fb BFF nmkhbvx
It just feels right that I’m 2 days late
The start was sussy
13:23 What is that thing!
Genshin!  Basically Zelda but sexier
God I was watching this and like seeing all these dreams and I’m like “My god”like my dreams are SO CRAZY! Like there have been a few dreams of mine where I actually woke up drained- Like literally! Man dreams are strange…
Is the ray in James' (TheOdd1sOut) supposed to be a Mantine? I thought he meant a ray gun when he was talking about it.  I have to admit, that's my favorite dream since I'm a sucker for cartoon villains! LOL 😍 That would have been a great animated special!   I hope someone makes a reaction vid of this! I LOVE IT!
I seen Your Book the other day I didn’t Have enough money for it  = I
13:41
so like how to train your dragon.
Nice to see jack from choalin showdowns made an appearance
I have trouble remembering details of dreams when I wake up, but the ones that stand out to me the most I always do art of them. Also makes me realize I either don't dream alot or my brain just voids all the information normally when I wake up because of how far spaced out my dream art is when I look at dates 🤣 I wish as a kid I wrote down most my dreams, just to see how repetitive some of my dreams were, because during most of my childhood I had no good dreams, it was only nightmares until my early teen years.
Bro when he said it was sponsered by genshin impact i just fell off my bed
Sixth storys stile 👌
I had a dream, where I was watching videos with SMG4 Mario in an empty classroom with round tables.  While we were watching a red crewmate from Among Us appeared.  The crewmate made Mario angry enough to chase him around the room.  Then, the Air Force showed up and detained Mario and the Crewmate, before demanding I come with them.  When I asked why, they told me it’s because I saw too much.  Then, I was taken away on an Air Force bus.  I didn’t see Mario or the Crewmate after that, so they were probably put in a different vehicle.  As the bus traveled, it stopped to pick up one of my friends, who supposedly had seen too much as well.  In the middle of the journey, the officers told me to strip.  I didn’t comply with their orders, but they didn’t seem to mind the silent refusal to strip.  Eventually the bus stopped at an Air Force base.  Inside, me and my friend sat on the floor in a large meeting room, until the dream ended.
When I slept one night and I went to the toilet in my dream and I felt a warm feeling and well you know the rest
OH HECK IS WHAT WAS THAT JACK SPICER UP AND FRONT XIAOLIN SHOWDOWN WAS SOME QUALITY HECKA SHIT
0:44 is no one gonna talk about that? Just me? 😳😳😳 ok 🤨📸
I have clicked the bell and HOPE I AM A SUPER MARTIAN! LET KING MAAZ KNIGHT ME AS ONE AMONGST HIS GLORIOUS CONQUEST, SO THAT WE MAY SQUASH THE LADDIES BELOW WHATEVER WE HAVE INSTED OF FEET
13:29 Oh hey, it's ya boi, Emil!
0:35 that some AMaazing cake right there, man
I’m a somewhat lucid dreamer, my mind just jumps from one thing to the next,’ but I can’t control my dreams like other lucid dreamers.
AbnormalChaos YOU SCARED ME ;-; u not the only one with the name chaos and with fluffy hair >=/ T-T"
If I animated my dreams let's just say it couldn't be on youtube
WHO TOOK LUIGIS KNEES?!
I think you made theodd1sout look Asian
I had a dream about getting Klee in Genshin impact 😂
I really love g@# animters i really love them i really hope there is more youtubers like that         I hope i dont get hate:(
that pee thing kinda relatable(no i did not wet the bed)i was sleeping on the floor because i was in my cousins house and  there were no beds so i used a mattress for the floor and i somehow came to the floor once and i felt it in the dream and  i hit my head in the bottom of a bed above
Lmao the scene with maaz and James traumatizing child James 🤣😂
Person falls from the sky and people don’t trust them? Sounds familiar! I’m gonna play Pokémon Legends Arceus now!
What the hell Your dreams actually have a plot  I really to step up my dreams game
When maaz uploaded this video I had a similar dream to maaz's magic world  Instead of a alien from a different world  I fell into a school from the sky Now I'm unconscious And I wake up and there are a bunch of anime people    And they attack me  As soon as they get near me I say Something random (don't remember) and all their hands exploded and they ran   Then I point a GUN I somehow had a gun   And then I woke up
Lucid dreaming is the best I absolutely recommend it
#ANIMATORSMAFIAPART3
James = based
Amaaz pleas do Maafia 3😀
I was that Egg that haunted theodd1sout Remember it’s time to get up James your sleeping but not for long it’s time to get up in the morning!
I used to play- until one day I felt myself making this my idol so I stopped playing
We know that you made out with Aquaman. No need to hide it from James.
That egg would've made me die
I always remember my dreams idk why there most of the time i end up dying in my dream
I love you
How are your dreams so story like :0
Them: records dreams Me: not having a dream for a year
I remember when i first started playing Minecraft, i would get these nightmares. (I think i got them like 10 times or something, probably less idk)  I was on the surface during night-time, and the ground was lit up very well, and there was a cave right were i was, which was also lit up. And for some reason, i walked in a corner of the cave entrance, and just stood there. Then all of a sudden, a lot of zombies came towards me from the surface, and for some reason i couldn't move. I tried escaping but i just stood there. I was down at 3 hearts, and then i woke up.   It was terrifying.
I've written down 70 dreams the past 2 years. It's a pretty fun activity :D But can get pretty exhausting tho :)
What's a random dream hmmmmmm this one where i was in a forest and siren head threw me in a river then I walked to a cave or house I forgot which then I say I saw siren head amd a family of bigfoots that are in gorilla posture said it wad them siren head came but he looked like a cheap edit then I imagined a robot and I controlled it and I started punching him in the face then the dream ended  Yeah it was weird
I’ve actually been documenting my dreams for 2 years! The last dream I had was one year ago…
Damn I had a body swap dream, wasn’t as fun but it was pretty cool!
hello im both a fan of genshin and you so hello :)
9:35 that's a literal nightmare!!!
0:41 um the cloud is ummmm...look at the cloud..something akward is happening
Parapallegic Luigi
What did we learn today? Mazz is a racist
James had flumpty as an alarm clock
0:41 THE CLOUD HELP
THE EGG
So nobody Is gonna talk about the egg demon
Bro I was Playing Genshin Right before U saw this video
i had a dream of mickey mouse coming out of the tv
Eyeless James is CURSED.
The “it’s time to get up “ one is a absolute nightmare 😱
For over 2 years, my dreams have been getting weirder and weirder… 💀
James was like : Genshin? OH HELL NAH NO NADA!
I AM BUGTRAP
"Yae Mico who can absolutely step on me" AMazzing 2022
The Genshin Impact sponsor scared me bc I was playing it while watching this
I love the art for the dragon prison one. amazing
Why does Maaz's dreams make sense
One night at flumptys?
Make a animation about a dream nightmare (my dream nightmare is about zombies)
Why is James so short
the egg monster will now forever haunt my dreams
Demon? EGG?! FLUMPTY BUMPTY, ARE YOU HAUNTING JAMES AGAIN?
I had a dream about these two girls who were princesses and they were kept up in two separate towers side by side like Rapunzel. And instead of waiting for prince charming they tied their bedsheets together and made like, a path from eachothers windows so they could hang out every day and became girlfriends after being friends and eventually falling in love.
13:22 Idk why but that part just made me wheeze like a psychopath
"Pot brownies"
Really you play genshin Impact to  Omg yeeesssssss
Flumpty Bumpty
You deserve more than 1millon subs
in a way, dreams are technically just really great tv shows or movies that hasn't been created yet. Recently, I had one about having wings and trying to figure out how I got them-
I honestly feel offended James didn't called it dragon jail... DRAGON JAIL DRAGON JAIL, ITS ALMOST  TIME FOR DRAGON JAIL
Me: I don’t remember my dreams 😭😭😭
Omg that egg dream killed me 🤣😂🤣
One of the dragons looks like Ralsei from deltarune
I had this dream where you could be anything that you wanted to be just by thinking it somehow. ANd people would try to think of the fastest thing possible an than have races, but my imagintion was hyper active, so I would turn into things like purple tigers with dragon wings and a scorpion tail that shot lazers an for some reason, where ever I went I left a trail of sparkles. I had other things I turned into too, but that was the main one. And then some crinkly noise started dissolving the world an the only way to stop it was to reach the top of the sky, since it was the last place the noise touched. But I stopped being able to transform as I was flying and fell and woke up. Turns out the crinkly noise was my mom lifting the blinds. There were also clouds like the ones the lakitus ride in mario, but they delt damage.

I relate to James weird dreams so much 😂😂 I have a group chat with some friends where I write down my weirdest dreams
Oneoddsout without eyes looks... --_-- WTFFF!!!?????
I hope James makes his last dream his alarm.
Furry prison is the best prison   Officer take me away
Oh no! He didn’t say the odd is out, he actually said the odd1sout! Something’s wrong. Definitely.
“take me away to furry prison”  *you don’t know what you’re asking for*
I remember a dream where i go in my house and i see a cute hamster and i try to pet it instantly and when my hand gets near the ham it turn into a mouse and bites me i woke up sweatin scared with my heart beating 500times a sec just to find out the muse that bit me was my other hand that grabbed my r hand(the hand in my dream)
Idk why but i read the video age as 1 year ago and was wondering how i could’ve missed this upload
I had a dream once as a kid where a sound from real life was part of the dream.  I was walking outside in the sun, and then I saw this big cave in a hillside. I went inside and it was really dark, so I was startled by a huge shape that I walked past. It turned out to be some Pokémon (the only one I remember clearly was a Bulbasaur/Ivysaur). They were hiding to prank anyone who entered the cave, and they started laughing at me. As they were laughing it sounded more distorted and shrill. I phased out of the dream and into real life to find that the smoke alarm in the hotel room was going off and that was what their laughing had been. (btw there wasn't actually a fire)
I’m shipping your animation selves for sleeping together
DRAGON JAIL, DRAGON JAIL, ITS ALMOST TIME FOR DRAGON JAIL!
Genshin is for fatherless freaks.
*Maaz having a dream* “oh, i just woke up, i should probably write this dream down on the notes app so i remember” The notes: “aquaman”
Take a shot every time James says dragon
Hi
13:41 you  not been able to sleep because you know we could die Tomorrow
I had a dream that some random kid in my school wanted to kill me. Right when we were questioning him I woke up
Y'all have actually really cool dreams but my dreams are flat out just weird man.
I once had the dream were me and my friends got were being killed one by one by a werewolf on my parents garage and when I got killed I woke and could still feel the pain of the bite in the exact spot where he bit me.... so that was scary
I Dream darkness… yep only that
I watch a youtuber Who doesnt animate mouths, they only draw eyes and here AMaazing is, only mouth No eyes 😌🤨
When I used to see myself I always saw a toilet and moved towards it, just walking towards it but I didn’t need one
The sleep parálysis egg is flumpty bumpty xd
I love how I recognized Rush’s art as soon as it started
I love how all the things Maaz said in the sponsorship I have already done. I also love the strange dreams concept
Thanks for these freeprimos man
Poor Kid James.
I head a dream about getting raiden shogun and her weopen yesterday I got mona and I am just so sad
I rarely have a dream but i just did when this videos came out.. it was so good too. There was plot and drama .. it was like a tv show
NO... its scaly prison
Do this but with some viewers it will be so dumb and crazy
Funny how Mazz was talking about genshin impact and then a world where people use magic and someone from another world came
damn i see alot of old show like dexter and xaolin show down...damn i feel old...
COOKIE RUN KINGDOM BEATS GENSHIN IMPACT
Flumpty bumpty had visited you in your dream james :)
Bro did you find one of my ocs in that dragon prison-? That first dragon was probably mine lmao-
4:57
Its time to get up Its time to get up Its time to get up Its time to get up
Others: dreams about each raindrop tasting like different soda flavors, dragons and wizards, etc.  Me: has super vivid dreams about buffets and people getting food poisoning from things I don't like. No seriously that happened and it honestly is bizarre.  The first one was Easter dinner and my whole family other than me got sick from expired peas and carrots from 2017.  The second one that happened the night after the first one was a huge potluck of many types of food. In that dream, I could actually taste the food (weirdly enough). My parents got sick from hardboiled eggs due to them being cold.   It's either sick dreams or apocalyptic (2012 the movie, or zombie type) dreams..... I rarely win in my dreams ugh 😑 😒
What was he doing to james before the video
our boi really had an dream about Flumpty Dumpty
When i was younger 10:45 this was relatable i sometimes got a dream where i go to the toilet and then i just pee myself like that was so annoying
5:7 water ain’t an element (chemically speaking) it’s a compound made from hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) to make (H2O).
I had some pretty wacky dreams when I had the covid.  One that I wrote down was:  I was in my living room playing a game on the TV and there was a creepy woman on the screen I think she was dead.   Now I'm in my grandmas house and I lost one of my slippers that was bad I had to replace it or my dad would hit me-  (not my real dad he's great I love him)   -I think he's dead now but he still comes around.  Now I'm in a car with my sister, at least I think its her, and she's driving me to band practice but we don't go to band instead we go to a camp in the middle of a field with lots of garages with no houses contacting and lots of bad people, I look at my sister and its a black void.   I'm back where I started in my living room playing the game with the creepy lady.  She says " I'm coming for you"  I tell my mom i don't want to play anymore and she says okay, i still don't have the other slipper, I'm scared I wake up in a cold sweat.  To this day it was one of the scariest dreams I've ever had.

the egg dream is just Flumpty Bumpty taking your alarm clocks job
Im watching this in the morning- so my mom is half asleep and half awake and she heard about James dragon jail and somehow inserted herself into the dream. So she was in dragon jail too and she could just watch James be told he was staying there for 2 years. I asked her if this worked with all the dreams, but no just the dragon jail. It must’ve been weird
2:20 why has no one pointed out that dragon from chitin nuggit?
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
😡 I am a genshin impact HATER 😡
I love how every story has a different style from different animators! It makes the stories more unique.  Amazing video!
technically you didn't animate this lol
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa Yes
Whoa that was awsome
2:21 in the right corner is that Frewch Fwy (French Fry) from chicken nugget?
how do you remember your dreams bro
Their dreams: My dreams: AAAAA LOOK AT THIS THERES A GIRL WEIRD S**T EVERYWHERE
The sleep paralysis dream *screams of One Night at Flumptys*
Love that he's sponsored by Genshin Impact as I'm a beginner ! (AR lvl 16)
I like when the wizard dream Maaz woke up and chose violence
James' dream alarm is Flumpty?
It was night time in my dream (nvm it was a nightmare) and I was flying away from someone or something (they were also flying)   idk I didn't look back my heart was racing and suddenly I saw myself in 3rd person I wasn't moving so it's like a google maps perspective and I can turn around to see my surroundings.   I saw the person looked like a black manequinn, humanoid but no eyes no mouth and they were pitch black.   I looked around and saw I was heading towards a pine tree forest and the pine trees were really tall and they were a few feet higher from me even though I was flying pretty high.   I made a plan to fly into the trees and then take a sharp turn towards a very basic house, its walls were connected to make a cube and it had a pyramid roof, I did not look to see if the house had any windows or even a lock. (so basically this:)    /\    [_] (except it was 3d)   I was still in 3rd person mode (except this time I was in the sky and was watching it like the 3rd person view you had in pokemon fire red) and I watched myself execute the plan and when I was about to touch the doorknob, ... ... ... I woke up.
I once had a dream where a zombie horse attacked me, but I caught it in a sliding door, then it began singing so I kicked it in the face then Yosemite Sam was talking to a radio that looked like the magic school bus lady, and then an army of zombie horse started invading just as I woke up
I did write own my dreams and some of it actually happen in real life. Like a short flash of what happen. One of it is i remember i go to a shop/restaurant and i was sitting with my friends and one of them spill the drinks and their cloth ruin. And i wake up followed by 2 weeks later and i just remember the exact sceen and i told her to use straw to drink and she drink it but the lady next to us spill her drink on her cloth. And i still think that i might save someone day and ruin the others day. Man that was a journey.

We cant ship James with Jaiden...Just Maaz
Yo the egg reminds me of flumpty
The animators of Pot Brownies did amazing (not saying the others did bad, I just preferred them over everyone else). Please feature them more.
The Sleep Paralyze Demon is just pure creepy
My friend used to count their fingers when they woke up, idk if they do it anymore.  But the point of it was so that if they ever ended up in one of those dreams that you can control what's happening (the ones people usually wake up from once they realize they have control) they'd count their fingers, which would give them self awareness so they could control it before they woke up.
I remember buying french fries in a bookstore
Anyone else reminded of one night at flumpty’s
Tips for people starting genshin: 1. Dont grind too hard it might lead to hate the game. 2. Dont rush to the end game enjoy the play through 3. Pick and pull for the characters you like and not take others opinion too seriously. 4.there will always be a flavour of the month so unless you want to spend a lot of money dont pull for all the characters. 5. Test out the abilities before you pull for a character.
THE EGG DREAM— I’M— I’M NOT GOING TO SLEEP ANYMORE—
I got a dream where I woke up from my sleep and heard news about zombie apocalypse. I got shocked so hard I felt like I got a heart attack, so I decided to grab some weapon (while shitting my pants) and pick up my family escape with boat (I live on an island ), so when I'm in front of my house  door, I wake up from my dream, I still feel scared
The pee one is happened to me and 2 second later I woke up I can feel the pee this fine we can sleep that I like doesn't move and I woke up my dad laugh on me :(and I sometime pee because of fan and I have dreams of my roof I can see myself like that something in the and can  move but I cannot control my body that was that was weird dream
I’m gonna tell my weirdest dream So once I was in the mall with me mom and we were in the escalator, then I was watching YOUTUBE on her phone, then there was a man right next to me then he YEETED the phone then my mom disappeared ???? Then the escalator just flipped upside down and I fell down to the ground. THAT MAN I STILL REMEMBER VIVIDLY HOW HE LOOKS LIKE. he had a bald spot, brown hair, probably like 50, and he was wearing a green shirt, and a mustache, black eyes for some reason.. Anyway that dream was like 3-4 years ago or something. Anyway that was the weirdest dream I remember VIVIDLY from 4 years ago.
Hi
The weirdest dream I've had predicted my meeting some of the people I know now
I liked the wizard duel animation :D
I think to play genshin impact for last year I guess  but I was so beautiful I could imagine this real-world like VP Playstation.
13:30 yo is that one night at flumpty’s 4?
im gonna say that i like genshin impact but that it is almost just almost a clone of breath of the wild.
MY GOoood, MAAZ let's play genshin together! please? :)
BROOO THE ANIMATION ON THE SECOND STORY IS DOOOOPEEEEE
I can't escape Genshin. Even with my favorite animators-
*IT'S TIME TO GET UP* *IT'S TIME TO GET UP* *IT'S TIME TO GET UP IN THE MORNING* *IT'S TIME TO GET UP* *IT'S TIME TO GET UP* *IT'S TIME TO GET UP TODAY!* *HA HA HA HA HA HAA* *HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!*
I just had a dream where I went to go hung a friend and he felt like bouncy memory foam for some reason
was baby dragon from clash their
So this dream happened I think a month ago and it’s the first time I can actually fully remember a dream so here we go  So we were in I think in the city of  New Orleans And it was a zombie apocalypse and I saw there were three people sitting around the fire across for me those three people were  Bryson from haminations. Sweeto toons. And my best friend but he look like a rubber hose character name ink. And so as we were walking around I was looking around for food or Shelter you know you’re average Apocalypse needs and we have an upon a bar but as we got closer to it we heard crying from the bar Then me in the dream immediately knew what dream I’m having is a dream about left for dead in the crying meaning we were setting into a death trap But I didn’t say anything because I wanted to see what will happen as we enter the bar we saw a. Women with light blue hair and wolf ears on top of her head wearing a blue dress yep it was Wolfychu you can imagine the conversation after that and here’s how it went And so all of us slowly turned to look at Sweeto And then this happened  Ink: soooo Sweeto: no Me: dude what do you mean no Sweeto: I mean no you’re not killing my girlfriend Bryson: hey I hate to break it to you but your girlfriend A witch  Ink: not to mention she’s already dead and also why don’t we just leave her Sweeto: we’re not leaving either I spent so much time trying to find her Me: this isn’t like those zombie song animation Wolfe made She’s legitimately gone and there’s no cure you can inject her with  And then we kept arguing Until ink came up with something ink: What if we just file her nails so she can’t stab us I put a blindfold on her so she can’t see us therefore not want to kill us  It’s all we all agree that that would be a lot better than cutting off her limbs yes we actually did consider that  And so once we filed her nails down got a piece of your fabric and put it over her eyes so she can’t get in raged and try to kill us we took her with us and we walked out of the bar and it was already sunset and we just walked into the sunset and then that’s when I woke up I have never ever been so confused with a dream I argued with a you tuber because we might head to kill his zombie girlfriend and after so long of arguing we resolved by filing her nails and putting a l blindfold fantastic  So if you’re reading this you read all of my story I hope you enjoyed so comment what do you think and I will read your comment probably all right see ya
ODDS RAY KONSTER DREAM IS MY FAV ANIMATION
But instead of the wizards it was the gods
Plus the dream you explained is kinda like genshin impact

I had a dream where i was at a carnival and i dont remember the beggining but i remember the last part.  I was leaving but i saw a ride near the entrance was free so i wanted to try. So my cousin got on and was buckled and i got on too. But the ride turned on and started spinning really fast, And i wasn't even wearing  the seatbelt. So i was holding on for dear life until I let go and i flew through the air and hit the middle of a ferris wheel. And then I fell onto the ground and stumbled around, A few seconds later i woke up.

13:22 is just one night at flumptys
Once I had a dream that I was a character in Charlie Brown delivering doughnuts on a moped and someone drove up next to me, took off my helmet, and shaved my head on the freeway. I glued the hair to the inside of the helmet, put it back on, and kept going. Then when I got to the house I was delivering to it switched to later on that night and I asked my “grandma” (not my irl grandma it was some random lady) if I could have another doughnut bc there were only 2 left. She said yeah and grabbed the other one for herself. She left and I was about to eat mine when The Rock showed up in my window wearing a leather jacket and breathing heavily. I broke my doughnut in half to share and when I reached out to hand him his half he grabbed the other half instead and bit it super aggressively. Then it switched again to a commercial for the jacket he was wearing and it had the Danny Phantom logo on the tag. This was years ago but I still remember it bc it was so weird lol.

My grandma sings that song from the egg every morning before this video.
Hahaha 😂 I feel like we've heard these before 😃
At least it is not sponsored by raid shadow legends
The jack spicer at 7:13 made me lose it yes someone remembers xiaolin showdown!!!!!!
Never new maaz was a discord moderator
13:39 I know someone has this as their alarm now on repeat
The last one reminds me of "One Night at Flumpty's"
thanks for the free primogems <3
I had a dream when I was about 5, and I can remember the dream very vividly.  So I was at my grandma’s house and she walks out and says “You’re at your dad’s house.. Wake up.. Wake up.. Wake up..”  I woke up and I was at my dad’s house, and nobody was awake so it freaked me out. 🤪
I thought pot brownies were brownies made in a pot not we*$
my dad used to play genshin impact on his PC!
7:00 racism
Y’all should make a dream book
when i was little i had this reoccuring dream about being in a museum with my family in this big empty room with paintings on the walls, an ice cream stand in the back left corner with an exit next to it, and a big beige sofa in the middle. there was an entrance to the room, it was one of those big entrances you'd see for entering your living room or something like that, those big ones without doors- and i was looking at the entrance and this big "monster" started walking by it, it was discord from my little pony with out legs and floating with purple sparkly dust/mist coming from behind it. my family saw it too and someone said "its the monster! hide!" and so i hid by sitting on the sofa and grabbing a long pillow and holding it in front of my face. ...horizontally. the monster could see me but ig just kept going anyway?? and when he was gone my grandma said "lets get some ice cream" and i followed my family to the ice cream stand but i guess i took too long to choose which flavor i wanted and i guess it was like a video game and time ran out because i didnt get any ice cream
God bless you #DrEdeSpellCaster for restoring back my relationship after casting a powerful love spell. Thank you sir you are forever recommended.
Not the pot brownies!
I once dreamt that I was being attacked by a hoard of zombies, and they cornered me in one of those portable play tunnels, and I turned around to face them, and suddenly I was a werewolf. I began to fight them off, by doing super awesome flips and tricks. And by the end of the dream, I'd killed about thirty of them. I remember waking up feeling super empowered.
“I went to a jail for dragons” hell yeah
I was so sore today because I went snowboarding and the egg made me laugh so hard so it really hurt so my crying was a mix of horror, pain and laughter and my family ( who was in the room with me ) thought I was dying
Can I just ask do people normally see things in there dream because I don’t think I do
Maaz i would have downloaded and played genshin impact But im too lazy to wait 100,00k years for it to completely download THATS HOW I ONLY PLAY MINECRAFT 😂🤣😂
Maaz is making money off of furry prison and Aquaman
i had a dream were i would be chased by flying sharks and every time they got me i would respawn and do it again
I love all the details and hard work he puts in!    Keep up the good work Maaz!!! :)
Do drugs kids
Uuuuhhh, healthy plot twist: The brownies are just plain choco brownies that were baked in a pot.
10:45 THIS HAPPENED TO MEEE!! It was very annoying..
poor luigi
I love 9:16 style it’s like fairly odd parents
I know James is telling the truth about the brownies just by the way he phrased that sentence
Egg timer woke TheOdd1sout up
POT BROWNIE PARTY AT MY PLACE!!!!!!
Ok i have like 3 dreams can you animate it ? I wont comment untell you reply
Revelations 3:19 “As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be zealous and repent.” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3:19‬ ‭CSB‬‬..
Abnormal Chaos did a really smooth job too
I had a weird dream a few months ago. Oddly, this was not a nightmare. So, I was at a family reunion and none of the people there exist. Like, all of these old people related to me in the dream are not real in real life. All of us are on a hill, bunch of flowers everywhere, no clouds, it's extremely bright. Like someone turned on high contrast mode. Suddenly, there's this old guy in front of me (grandpa? uncle?) and he shakes my hand. As our hands pull apart, there was like this cheese-stretch of skin. The man vanishes into thin air. I am now really flipping confused about my hand, so I start poking it with my other hand. I figured out, after minutes of dreaming this part, that the back of my hand (excluding my fingers) melts when skin touches it.  Now all the old people and I are in this building's entrance, and there's just this sink. Random sink, basically in the doorway. Now, I think to myself: "Hey, what if rinsing my hand stops it from melting. Maybe my hand it too warm.". So I run cold water over my hand, followed by the poke test I did to figure out what was going on. Legitimately, it worked. Then my 4:00 AM alarm woke me up. I remember laying in bed afterwards, genuinely confused why I wasn't scared in the dream or in real life.
Anyone else bean waiting for this video for awhile when James said something about it on one of his streams?
I loved PartyDave ‘s animation. It may not have been finished, but the quality looked like it would be amaaazing, and had the proper amaaazing comedy.
I love Genshin impact 🤩
Maaz: **wakes up after dream** Oh God, I gotta write this down. This will be so good for the video. I can't wait to talk about it. Alright sooo....Aquaman....**falls asleep**
I wanna write down my dreams but I'm scared of lucid dreaming cuz it can lead to sleep paralysis
Next time my sis is late for school again, imma go "Its time to get up, its time to get up, its time to get up, in the morning! Its time to get up, its time to get up, its time to get up today! HAHAHAHAHHAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA!"
:0
this video was #theamaazing
No idea why I dreamt this, but I dreamt "what if Mario and Transformers were in the same world" and now I'm trying to make Starscream in M&L style for some reason. 8:33 why? why does Luigi not have legs? also, would the ray thingy have turned him into Super Dimentio? Luigi's most nightmarish appearance in Mario canon?
wow this entire video is fricking epic- ur so underrated
8:19 she sells sea shells on the seashore...
I had a lucid dream last night and it was not fun
I watched this on nebula~ also, the dreams are cool
"The next 2 hours" you clearly have no idea how edibles work bro, they last for like 4-6 hours
The Wizard Duel Dream was animated so well! Huge props to PartyDave!
Could u do this but their solely nightmares
"its time to get up,its time to get up,its time to get up in the morning! its time to get up,its time to get up,its time to get up,its time to get up in the day! HA,HAHAHAHAHAAAA,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HA!"                                                                                                                                                              -creepy-faced egg
When the egg started vibrating and singing, I was crying laughing! Great stuff!
The egg part reminds me of “one night at flumpty”
the redemtion code has an extra SC in it so it's actually ZSPDKSC3V8V5 istead of ZSPDKSCSC3V8V5
I love this video
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
Is it me or does the egg dream sound like flumpty  from one night at flumpty
Aqua man
Wait was one of the dragons in the part where u were talking bout escaping French Fwy?!

Hi
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
I've had lucid dreaming since I was young. I think I was fed up with the nightmares and just unlocked the ability to dream what i want, where I want, when I want. And it's awesome!
Did Luigi get his legs back
Hey I keep watching one of your videos on repeat and it's the mafia  Can you make a part 3 please🥺
MAAFIA
code won't work rip
What the hell? I am playing Genshin right now! How'd you know, Maaz!?
[07:12] BOX GHOST SUPREMACY 📦👻

They have no eyes.
👌
i had a lucid nightmare last night                i have only been lucid once thats not a nightmare
I had the weirdest dreams yesterday and wrote it down too. Plus I played genshin impact too lmao What?! 💀💀💀
13:40 this part is more funny then scarey
Zootopia Tiger.
Furry prison???
Omg I loved Odd1isout dreams were funny I really would like to see more
I have a weird dream I would like to tell!! So. My family and I pull into a dirt parking lot. We walk on a nature walk path for like, 10 minutes before getting to a beach. If you have seen a wrinkle in time, it was like that beach. My brother and sister run off, they’re gone. My dad goes over to this old man, who’s probably around 60. This guy has a massive wall of sand facing the ocean and my dad just pushes it over. For no reason. They’re both laughing and so is my mom and I’m just standing there like “I… don’t get it.” So my parents pick me up by my arms and throw me into the ocean. We’re having a grand old time, my siblings are at a swim up lemonade bar for no reason and then the dream has one of those crappy transitions that dreams have and I’m in this house where everything is bigger than it’s supposed to be (but only by a little). I’m with a rat and a snake and we’re hiding under a table. My parents and siblings were apparently kidnapped by the cartoon version of uncle fester. The rat BETRAYED me and bit my leg. So I turn into a cat, but like the movie CATS version and chase after this rat and suddenly my family and I (and uncle fester) are being led through this candy land by a tour guide lady. And this isn’t bright or colorful it’s just normal looking. But it’s all candy. I reach out to take a piece of a bush and the lady says, “Except that. Don’t eat that.” And slaps it out of my hand. We come to a crossroad and we go done the one that has a road with cars at the end of it. A sewer cover is in the very middle. We open it up and there’s this white plastic water slide. My mom shoved me in and says “you go in first.” It’s a huge water slide and breaks off into different sections until we’re all places in vr headsets that play a video of the top ten scariest roller coasters. When it gets to number 1, a trap door opens and we’re all on a real life simulation of that roller coaster. We are led down to this football field, it’s night now so the bleacher lights are on and my librarian is there coaching a football game and asks us if we want to be on the shirts or skins team. We say that we have to go home, so we do. I go to sleep and then wake up in the dream to my librarian standing there saying “wanna talk about books?” The end
11:03  this hppened to my sister once because when we were kids we once lived in a very small apartment with only one bedroom so my 5 femily members (including me) were using two beds and one air matrece to sleep and my dad was on the air matrice and my sister on one of the beds and she had a dream where she was getting chased by freddy fazbear and she through up on him but in real life she puked right onto my dad's face right as he was about to get to sleep and we still joke about it to this day
Early????
Am I the only one who felt these were kind of tame? Or am I just weird?
in the dragon one did anyone think one of the dragons looked like ralsei or asriel?
Your making a hole anime
Party dave iş the best
YES NEW VID
the egg tho  o-o
My dream was crazy! It was all black and then i wake up. One of the best dream ever
7:09 bro got the josuke cut
I've never had a dream in my life...
heads up, you wrote the code in the description wrong
"How dare you be a foreigner " Someone's gonna take this out of context one day
bro the sleep paralysis one was way funnier pictured than it probably was in his dream oh my god i was laughing so hard
today I has a dream where I was playing a game and then i get hit by a red anomalicaris with Dr doofinshmirtz' head
Kinda funny that in the genshin impact ad he just talked about raiden shogun and guess what,she's right there maaz we can already see that
aquaman
I had this dream that this group of girls turned into demons and they attacked another girl, so the girl ran into a supermarket and tried to get my friends, my parents and I to help. We all got waterguns out and the girl told us the demons could only be defeated by being near a terrier because apparently terrier dogs are able to hunt down demons..somehow? Luckily, I have a terrier, so I pick him up and start cutting off bits of his fur and putting it into some holy water...? I loaded the waterguns with the holy dog fur water and started spraying the demons. It worked and I woke up
James’s last dream seems like some yokai or demon shit
I love how you drew Jack Spicer in this video.
JACK SPICER!!! 7:13
9:24 But... they CAN...
The dreams I have would be the most bizarre thing you would ever see. Imagine going to a beach with a bazooka, then going to swim then it goes so deep then a war happens out of nowhere, after that I go to a Fortnite looking somewhat deathrun filled with yellow and blue. I had friends with me, we were running from a raptor, one of my friends get caught and turn to a zombie, and then she holds a gigantic object. Then it ends. Bizarre?
7:06 this dream is so weird
0:43 ummm MAAZ ITS ONLY BEEN 43 SECS
At the maaz part the quality disappeared
Hi maz are you really from Pakistan if so u must know how to speak Urdu right?
Sadly the code is now invalid :,))
The party dave segment is so well animated, definitely a job well done.
I had a time traveling bicycle in one of my dreams
I have had multiple dreams Where i knew i was dreaming
Jameses reaction to the sponserships is mine
I had a dream yesterday about being a Mandalorian. It was really dope, I even had the darksaber.
Party Dave's animation is sick.
I liked the perfect monster
I  keep having this dream where I was in a house that was black and white and the walls were wood planks and many of them were broken in half sticking out of the walls. I continued walking and the house began to shake and I felt very uneasy so I started running to the way I came in and right as I get to the door these giant bars appear in front of me then all I saw was black and a what heard to be a little girls laugh. I woke up on one of the walls of the house and I saw a door. when I opened it i saw my porch and a man sitting there staring at the field where I live on. Everything was back in color. I looked and saw a big pitch black mass of some sort and 2 red dots for eyes. Then he started to talk to me  “It’s beautiful isn’t it” “What do you mean “Everything”   I look back and the black mass has transformed into a giant person of some sort but just very big arms, body, legs, and head no other features and the 2 red eyes. It was walking right towards us. I ran back inside for dear life and as I was running the walls began to open and leak a black substance but I didn’t care I ran and ran and found myself at the metal bars again. I saw it’s face. 2 red dots and that’s it. It started to shift and it leaped inside of me through my eyes and mouth. After it was all gone I saw black liquid coming from my eyes and mouth. Then I screamed and woke up.
NGL I got REALLY excited when he said this video is sponsored by Genshin Impact is a really good game and I REALLY recommend playing it take this from an AR 48 player
don't say the LORD'S name in vain
react on rg bucket list he animates better than anyone in your whole animation squad
That couch in the beginning is kinda sus
4:29 I’m absolutely OBSESSED with the action in this, I can’t get enough
James’ dreams are scary.
Dragon Tales Dragon Tales we're all waiting for dragon tails
It's time to get up!  It's time to get up! It's time to get up! It's time to get up! IN THE MORNING
That egg thing is horriifing
Wet Monsoon with the cockroach dream was a good one, and also Partydave with Wizard duels. The freaking egg one is scary James I feel sorry for you. ;3;
Not me spending money just to get Bennett…
Wait people can get dreams I didn't know that I thought people don't get dreams and they see the empty void of nothing like me
Had a dream where wilbur soot and nihachu did horrible stuff and now im haunted, had the most scary dream about running from a ghost when i was like 5 or 6 and had one where i cant wake up and when i close my eyes it goes to a different dream to a point where i cry and the most recent one for marvel nerds i had a dream about doctor strange turning to cosmic spiderman (?) swinging in queens but in blue, so basically white polkadot blue spider man
Just here to inform RushLight Invader of my appreciation of the Jack Spicer cameo in the segment he animated.  As a longtime fan of "Xiaolin Showdown", it's nice to see it referenced when so few people seem to remember it, and the inclusion was definitely thematically appropriate given the subject matter!
Ok why do my dreams sound way crazier and more inconsistent then what they talk about. Like their dreams seem far to normal and consistent. XD
me: *has a dream that has a very creepy thing in it* scary but eh *goes back to sleep* also me: *has a dream about a bug coming after me* im never sleeping again....
Bro good job  But we want maafia 3 :)
I remember once in a dream a secondary character did something that after a beat I realised didn’t make sense and called them out. And was like “hey. You shouldn’t be able to do that!” And they got flustered and my dream fell apart real quick. I woke up confused and sad that I ruined the dream through 1 inconsistency
God damn it maaz you and James got me laughing the first 16 seconds XD
7:55 the best scene I've ever seen
The wizard duel dream really reminds me of the dream from Domic's dreams video where he's fighting the casein criminal lady, the animation for both is great, and the story's are kinda similar.
Omg 60 primogems
when maaz doesnt know that cockroaches can fly
I think I recognise that couch from somewhere🤔
Part 3
E
The pot brownies reminded me that in 2018 someone brought pot laced brownies to school and it was on the news, so that happened
Maaz you have no idea how much your videos make my day.
The genshin code is not working  and amazing video
Why do yall have fancy dreams? I just dream of light not working.
Is that the casting couch?
Hey Maaz can you speak Japanese? I'm asking because you lived there for a couple of years.
only 3 times have i gotten to the target that suplise every single plot device in all of my dreams ever the "sarget"
Party Dave needs his own channel 🤩
Cool!!!!
Cool!!!
Cool!!
Cool!
Cool
why do I actually want to watch like an anime with the plot of the wizards and the traveler dream
Why was James putting on a shirt at the end
"alright and so James you wanna try some pot brownies?"  "If you have some yeah I'll try some-"
.
Rushlight, wetmonsoon,abnormalchaos,funymony, & joelius all nailed it
pop brownies in bed…  im suuure nothing bad will happen~
having magic powers would be nice
Actually last week I had a dream (I forgot what happened coz there were alot of weird things was happening) but I the only thing I remember is there someone very close to didn't want to see or talk to me but all they did was walking away and didn't say anything and I was shouting at them to come back but I just broke down crying so much so when I woke up I was still crying in my sleep and I hated it so much
Do you ever had just started sleeping the n you start falling and then at last second you just wake up                                                        It’s terrifying
When I was where we were young I forgot what age but something but something will young and I had a dream where my parents are at my grandmas house and basically my dogs name Woody he’s still alive by the way basically Dan had laser eyes paragon kill me for some reason I don’t know why I had the tree but I did
8:49 Omg 😭😭
My worst nightmare im in a cave i didn’t know i was stuck and i was saying mom? MOM?? I had my voice so little lik m.o.mm so i started crying and i heard a voice saying my name it was demonic one and also i think i was stuck with chains while i saw some light up there and some red eyes i didn’t see i was 5 years old
7:16 I’m guessing this is by rush
They've finally been sponsored by genshin impact
"how do you expect to propose without any knees"
Amazing video, TheABaalding and the Bald1sOut delivered once again!
i remember my dreams so well that i bring them up to my friends sometimes as if it were a normal thing, and every time theyre like "no that never happened are you okay-"
mafia 3 when?
Guys, you get to dream???
0:42 yey le ship :3
Ever since quarantine I decided to write down my dreams (if I remember them lol ) and a lot of the times when I go through them I forget the context . This entire video is a pretty good representation of that. :D
How is maaz always so thicc tho ??
The one with the alien who doesnt know what water is is awesome, sounds like a book i would read
the most vivid dream ive ever had was me riding a flying dolphin, then it died and i was falling, and suddenly gru from despicable me was next to me trying to catch me and screaming “i’ll save you, my love!” but then buzz lightyear was going “she’ll never be yours, egghead!” and gru said “thats rich coming from you, condom head lookin ass” and then i hit the ground but i didnt die so i yelled at them both for acting like they owned me and rode off into the sunset in a kangaroo pouch with that one wind fairy from tinkerbell.
Same
and also the villian dream was a different version of the show Villianous
970th
James's nightmare was just One Night At Flumpty's
Foreshadowing to when jaiden said some ppl  hide other herbs in brownies
No joke, the Wizard Duel dream sounds like the beginning of an awesome anime series or a cool fantasy novel! Or both!
I’m glad Maaz did justice to Genshin Impact, usually adds are kinda half assed and no one really talks about the other features who aren’t early game like the different regions :)
Hm, interesting, how very interesting.
One night at flumpties egg
This sponsorship helped fuel my genshin addiction.. thank you.
Same...furry prison  +I love playing g.impact lol
I had a dream where i had spiderman powers and my colour blind friend was just blind, also king julien and mort from the Madagascar films were there, i dont even trucking know.
Finally our favourite lovebirds of the storytime animation together again :3
Can we talk about that cute little wave at the beginning
I had a nightmare last night, I was in a completely different home and I started getting weird texts about my location and then it slowly evolved into pictures of my neighbourhood until they sent me a picture of me through my window and then it just got worse and worse,I'd go upstairs to see windows open I'd check my phone to call someone for help and my phone wouldn't work and then I heard the door open and then I woke up, pretty scary
My dreams always have zero context. I'm either running from the police for some reason, or running from zombies for some reason, or fighting someone to death in some place for some reason.
I love the fact that James and I had the Same reaction About Genshin Impact
When people are saying only 60 primogems? Meanwhile every f2p players "We take what we can get "
13:30 he looks like Flumpty Bumpty but without arms and legs.
poor pacifist alien ^^'
Scary
He should have said WERES MY EYES!!!!
That was just james' inner furry wanting to be out so it was expressed in a dream
3:54 I also want Yae to step on me.
James’s nightmare is odd but terrifying
I feel like this was very rushed the quality of most of the video was above subpar
THAT GENSHIN IMPACT THING CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD…BUT…LESS GOOOOOOOO 😍🎉
*I’m very inspired and I want to start animating but I’m so insecure about it 😅*
The code 'ZSPDKSCSC3V8V5' in the description is incorrect 'ZSPDKSC3V8V5' is the correct code
Genshin impact isn’t that good tbh -an ar56 player
how the fuck are u creative in your dreams
*its time to get up it’s time to get up it’s time to get up in the morning* *its time to get up it’s time to get up it’s time to get up today*  *HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*
Am sad cause I dont think  I have ever had a good dream:(
Bro every furry likes Zootopia Tigers.
Who else has been waiting for this ever since that stream that I don’t remember the name of?
partydave did the best job
What I think James gott  sleepporelases
You talked about pee for a whole minute....
Dude, aquaman
3:53 so much for PG
Omg! the peeing thing actually happened with me like I was dreaming I'm in a toilet and in my dream I thought "omg! i can pee comfortably" that's when I woke up and realized I literally peed on the bed. Good memories lol
Elden ring is so good, it doesn't need to pay youtubers to sponsor it instead of playing it.
Maaz have u ever had a dream-that u-eve- wish that- u u- can do anything u want
funnily enough i do like genshin impact but my sister plays it a lot but i can't since idk how to download it on my laptop so it will be hard tbh
I thought I was drowning in a dream once and I was just face down on my pillow, not breathing, like an idiot
Maaz just casually throwing the rasen shuriken at the women
I like the Genshin impact who ever did it
Welcome back to the after dream world
all these animations were bussing, but the one with the mages and legless luigi, they hit different to me.
That poor person in Maaz's dream just wanted to see the ocean and the wizards just tried to kill her. James' last on was also creepy in a funny way
i like how odds one out and the amazing is literally ok to do anything
Heh  "Allows you to obtain a new character Yae Miko"  yea, that ended like week ago xD (ik they just animated it, but joke stay)
James dreams about Hampton damte
Throughout the entire sponsorship I was just saying “I knowww”  I’m AR 58… I haven’t missed a day in over a year…
me wondering what I should play  Mazz: Genchin Impact  Me: wait I have that
My weirdest dream:  I was backstage at a jojo siwa concert and jojo was busy doing something and everyone wanted jojo on stage and they mistaken me for her and made me wear a bunch of jojo merch and put me on stage. I had no idea what to do on the stage so I just started free styling about the clothing I was wearing……….
I had one where I was on a safari with some of my friends, but there were giant ants, buffaloes, and dinosaurs. And then I fell into a dinosaur skeleton and suddenly I was underwater and my sister was giant and had a mustache and shot a laser at me and I was dead.
That egg dream was fucking CREEPYYYYYY 😫😫😫 OMG NOOOOOO
The egg monster looks and sounds like flumty humpty.
Bro was the sleep paralysis nightmare egg friggin' Flumpty??? CUZ THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT CHARACTER WOULD DO.
Man, Maaz really left us on a cliffhanger with this Aquaman dream lol
dream stans: *clicks on this video and gets disappointed*
I need dream books
hey umm this yahin is nandyroo revanie friend
I really liked this video and each animator's work that went into it! ^-^
Please.... make it... stop.. its been 3 weeks... and i haven't.... done anything but... farming primogems... please....stop
me and my friend were talking about our strange dreams which both included one of my other friends, we finished, I went to YT, and this popped up X_X
You pals are the greatest keep it on 🙃
the animation was great pd:the code in the descripcion is wrong the one in the video is ok
James have a weird dream
I rarely have dreams and when I do have dreams the dreams straight up kills me one of the death dreams (yes I'm gonna call it that) was where I was living I just straight up jumped off the roof and died.. well not really I was walking for a bit then cut to irl the other death dream was me in a boat then the boat flipped over and as soon as it flipped over it launched me like a video game glitch into the air and once I woke up I felt like I had a heart attack.
My dreams are like a 12 minute episodes because that's the amount of sleep I get
In one dream me and my friends (we were seven) were driving in my moms car, we went to a baskin robbins because a furry pteradactyl that broke a building, and then there was a t-rex that was attacking us and then a purple guy pops out (btw the baskin robbins had a playground) and we go into the slide, i went to do the slide to escape but the purple guy looked at me and then it cut to me, my friends, and my parents. My friends and parents ordered ice cream, and i played tinker. I then woke up.
...
Ay I wanna do that
I love seeing dreams from other people be animated!
I once had a genshin dream where i got ayaka     *now i'm sad*
James should never play flumpty's
This is one of the best videos ever
I always get demonic dreams that I got used to it. So I’m not really scared of demonic stuff anymore, and yeah…. But I also get dreams about my crush or weird stuff.
Good, but not as good as that one time I dreamt of giant grapes, bathtubs, and eyebrows. Piece that one together as you will.
How in the hell did Maaz have an actually good plot in a dream? Is this how he practices his storytelling?
Wait y'all got dreams lucky
THAT EGG OH MY GOSH James saved the best for last I swear
One time I had a nightmare that I lived in a town with various borders in random areas and if you went outside the borders you had 5 seconds before a killer clown ran out of the forest to kill you. In the dream the clown only recently showed up, so people still needed to get things from places outside the borders, so every now and then the townsfolk would send someone out of the borders on the other side of town to get killed by the clown and lure him away so the others would have time to get things
I definitely also move in my sleep. I always wake up from my dreams with a literal kick, because (for whatever reason) all my dreams end with me falling from high up and landing feet-first.
Haaaa 🤣🤣🤣
I have this weird dream every Halloween that feels like a game, i was running at night around my neighborhood with a ton of other people my age like at least 1000, from some monsters who look like horror characters from games i was currently into, giant reptiles, animatronics some.exe characters, giant squids, clowns and many more. The goal was to hide in different houses and not get found and killed, but last Halloween i wasn't running i was actually a monster, a giant lizard who can use its tail to impale hiding spots, and spit venom to block a path. Because of that I'm always happy to stop trick or treating to go sleep earlier and playing more
you know, I can never pee in my dreams, like I'll try to, I'll go to the bathroom in my dream, but the pee will never come out, and that's usually how I'm able to realize it's a dream, is if I can't pee  which is pretty lucky because if not for that I'd probably pee my bed A LOT with how often that will happen in my dreams
You should do the same thing but with nightmares
I like this the different art styles really help to differentiate the dreams it's super cool!
11:00 I'm going to take that as a Jaiden cameo
I kid you not I JUST thought of this idea today. I was like “ I could animate my dreams and like actually show how they looked”
lets gooooo
the genshin redemption code in the description is typed incorrectly ^^ just in case you hadn’t noticed yet!
Psst ever heard of breath of the wild
so funny! XD I hate pee dreams though,also hate throwing up dreams to,I already have acid reflux problems,so that type of dream makes me feel even worse,but 99% of the time though,I don't remember what I dreamt of,so how can I write dreams down if I haven't had a dream in literal months
I had a lucid dream that transformed into a regular dream, and I had a magical sense that could detect planes. I was known across the land for my amazing ability to locate planes, and was on a mission, and I found one, but then I woke up.
I’m just wondering how Maaz sat here and said Sanginomiya Kokomi perfectly
5:11 omg madness combat!111!!111!1!1
Cockroaches can fly in real life
I love your animations and I want to know if we could colab our two channel’s us playing a Minecraft challenge.
Flumpty Bumpty?
Did anyone ever notice that part where maaz and odd1 were kissing in the cloud.
Show us a video of you playing Genshin Impact
I don't write my dreams down but I once dreamt that I was in bed and had just woken up in the middle of the night, and there was a black and red scorpion by my feet (reminded me of a black widow spider) and so I sat up and pulled my feet back a little, an the scorpion inched closer, so I threw my blankets off of me and stood up, but the scorpion ran off my bed onto the floor in front of me (my bed has no frame, just a mattress on the floor, same in this dream) and the scorpion says to me "you are not real. Humans are not real" in a familiar voice I can't quite place, and then I woke up shaking and my heart pounding and for days after I couldn't sleep without checking for scorpions near my bed (I live in a place scorpion-free so I didn't need to check, just paranoid for a while) (More dream experiences in replies)
I thought the fire man thing was in 'just stupid'
I just had a dream recently that a baseball player was on a rocket and flew into the crowd and then squire ward came out (this was in a baseball game) and started to kill everyone and I was scared for life
2:59 Breath off the Wild though
I only remember two dreams I’ve had. A scooby doo one and another one where a hot werewolf that looked a lot like Wolfgang from skylanders did my hair.  My dreams are odd
Last night I dream about this video but I just watch this video
Ok
I love all the references RushLight Invader did in the perfect monsters dream, I've yet to watch the video all the way through, but i had to stop and enjoy the references, especially Jack from Xiaolin Showdown
it's good they own up to their ...things
Not sure if sarcasm or if you just haven't encountered the cockroach varieties that do fly :)  They might not be in Australia, though, because they don't kill you.
Odds1out must do you tube vids again
i listen to music when i sleep and the song camel by camel (ankha zone song) was playing and i had a dream i was at school and for a "presentation" ankha zone was playing....
Hey amazing! Hey amazing!  Genshin impact sounds just like spell breack...
1:10 pedophilia
0:45 ayo Maaz what u be dreaming about
Dude: I had this dream so much growing up- so like- I would be in my grandma’s house. She was the sweetest, most calm lady ever, and she had a sewing room. So I went all around looking for her, and I didn’t see her. So I went to the sewing room and I saw Elmo sitting in the center of the room talking to himself. But he was green like Oscar the grouch. And I asked him where my grandma was, and he said “Elmo did a bad” then turned around and he was covered in blood and had a FREAKING KNOFE. And sometimes I would run, but he would kill me immediately. And other times I would start crying and hug him and he would start crying, and it was kinda sweet, but then he would stab me and I would wake up. So every time now when I see Elmo I kinda just try to not freak out because of that stupid dream where Elmo killed my grandma.
FIRST HEHE MOST LIKES LMAOO
You guys dream??
Once i had a dream where i was eaten by a flower-
I love how they make Genshin’s combat system so majestic and strategic in a way and in reality when you actually fight you just      Spam click until it dies
Hey Maaz can you make mafia 3?
0:18 more like Furry PRRRRRISON
Ive been playing genshin for 2 years
I once had a dream where Hugh Jackman was my BFF.
I remember genshin impact I didn't plan any of my fights
Epic
I have weird dreams all the time and I tend to remember them, even when I don't write them down. I love my dreams.
... Yae Miko's banner is already over 😔
Genshin Impact!
I wonder if these r even half as weird as mine... If whenever u say "I had a dream" and it friends sign than yk ur dreams r weird af lol
All the artstyles presented are really cool and unique.
the laughs sound fake                bc they are
794th comment trololololol
The egg was giving me one night at flumps vibe😭
Ridon shoga😀
I click on the video because I thought that was that egg from one night at flumpty's
Love from India ❤️
I like having lucid dreams, sometimes I go with the story sometimes I demand my brain to allow me to destroy my "loved" ones for the next 5 seconds I have.
Noticed the Animated degree in the background lol. Also, thank you for making my birthday better with this vid!
Me: Sees everyone’s cool comments about dreams they’ve had, and wants to share my own Also me: *forgets every dream I’ve ever had
13:32  Surprise Flumpty cameo! I know it's not really him but it's odd how similar they are.
love the new animation style
Aquaman
13:30 FLUMPTY. BUMPTY.
I don't remember like 99% of my dreams, so I'm jealous, don't even really get nightmares anymore.
LOL WHAT THE FRICK MAAZ 0:43 🤣yall makin’ out
COOLL, i didnt know u play genshin impact there kind cool th
GenShin impact is a direct copy of tloz botw
You know that feeling of when you’re dreaming and it feels like your falling? I had a dream where I woke up like that but instead of falling, I was being attacked by a dog while walking my own.
7:12 why the he'll is there a grunt from halo wat evil thing could the grunt have done to be there
Wtf I’ve had a similar dream to the cockroach one, like way too similar.
Yes cockroaches can fly, have you ever heard of a palmetto bug?
Who else got really excited when they saw a Genshin code, just me? Ok
I like the mix of different animations in your videos, a little refreshing and rather nice to watch how it will switch it up for every specific scene
Maybe you guys are right, I should write down what I remember from a dream that's long and vivid to know what happened as an idea.
I had a dream where me and my dad were at a park when it was raining, and I was looking out the car door and i saw a trantula, then we came home and I touched my brothers mole on his neck, and it started bleeding, but it was bubbles and not liqued. Than my brother used my blue towel and it turned red. Than I woke up. And that was one of the weirdest dreams I ever had, I have like 4 other  weird dreams lol
Finally the best animator with each other
Question here how do you put in codes?? I don’t know how
"This video is sponsored by Genshin Impact" Me: I raise my respect for you
0:00 what's James sitting on?
The AMaazing : animated no eyes  Let Me Explain Studious : animates no mouth  What if they both collab ???
scarey egg:IT TIME TO GET UP IT TIME TO GET UP IT TIME TO GET UP ON THE MORNING IT TIME TO GET UP IT TIME TO GET UP IT TIME TO GET UP ON THE DAY HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
K that wizard duel was awesome. I want that in an animated series.
I have this "dream" that a guy like in a cartoon cat costume keeps watching me thru my window it's rlly scary
I love when you collaborate with James
Poor luigi🙁
My favorite is "Wizard Duel"
SIMP alert
YES GENSHIN IMPACT
My weirdest is being chased be Captain America, but he’s crawling around like a spider. On all fours, and he could crawl on the ceiling and on walls.
now I'm gonna dream about the egg with a horrific smile. It's too scary to even think about
I wanna caution people who wanna try this. I wrote down my dreams for a while years ago. My dreams became super vivid, they were always good or just bizarre, and it got to the point where I started questioning in my dream if I was dreaming. Flash forward a few years and mental health issues and my dreams are still super vivid, but now they're nightmares and they feel real. Half the time they're just too realistic to shake off and I wake up upset and disturbed and yes I'm talking to my therapist about it. So, yeah, you know your headspace better than anyone, but if you want vivid dreams, just be mindful that nightmares are dreams too and it will work the same way. Have fun, but stay safe 💜
“How dare you be a foreigner” Based Maaz
K ima go have nightmares;)
13:41 lmao
Y'know all these dreams would make really good story books
dream’nt
You are mad for thinking TO SPONSOR GINSHIN INPACT
I remember when I was very young, I had a dream where I was in a supersized store (I had just watched toy story for context) and I was driving around in a race with some guy. At some point I remember he threw a water bucket at me to slow me down and I woke up in my bed drenched in pee.  Nice
0:48 Oh man I just realized what that Maaz made this room look like.... THIS on purpose....  If you know you know
AAAH GENSHIN IMPACT 😭
cool
You’re a genshin impact fan?! 🤮🤮🤮
Anyone else have a nightmare of a giant Kermit chasing them?……………….no? Just me?
Aquaman
7:14 Xiolin Showdown
Anyone wanna tell Maaz cockroaches can fly?
Does anyone know the aesthetic/art style from the first dream? I love the dragon sketches :D
I love the James squid mega super villain and smaller villains perfect monster animation
10:44 is correct
Alright if Maaz approves of geshin impact everything is a ok......as long as no one mentions RAID SHADO-   *By completing that sentence you will be forever cursed.
@cats
I just woke up from a 4hr nap, but I had a dream that was disturbing enough to be a nightmare but completely incoherent.  Heres what I remember: I was playing as Sora from Kingdom Hearts and fighting the little shadow heartless.. I'm transported to my school but it's not my school and is just an elaborate set of hallways and stairs with shoulder to shoulder tight corridors. There were humanoid SCPs in those corridors so everytime I entered one, there would be one slowly walking after me (i dont think they had specific titles or names, or any distinct abilities, one of them was voiced by Markiplier). One SCP looked like slenderman, except less taller and wore a white suit, it was following me for a while down the hallway and I kept looping around this staircase (this is a very confusing layout). At some point, I got to a dead end or just a locked door, and the slenderman scp stops in front of me and slowly rips off his face, before revealing another white blank face (there was a lot of blood), and then slapped some googly eyes on and just laughs manically as I stood there in discomfort; not sure how I didnt wake up in horror.  Then, i just went to my choir class as normal and woke up really confused.
I have a weird nightmare of missing one step on a stair, then waking up in cold sweat. I didn't fall, I didn't touch the ground, and I don't know what's at the stairs. I just know I misstepped, and this made me fear downwards elevators for a few months/years.
Look at Maaz making content longer than 2 minutes, unlike another animator that uploaded today.
So here is my most random dream  So i was in the hallway of where i live, i was fighting someone(i think it was zombozo from ben 10) and i had the same powers as kevin(also from ben 10) and in the middle of the fight we just begin to analyse the rock quality to see which one i should be, but then when i turn around half of the hallway became the end(minecraft) and i turned into end stone, but then zombozo "betrays me"(i dont think there was an official alliance) AND EXPLODES THE END ISLAND, then i woke up, but my brain is so slow that i thought the dream was real and was really confused, because you know, i should have died(i hadnt opened my eyes yet, literally) and then i realised it was a dream and laughed at how long it took me to understand it was not real, it wasnt too long, just long enough
I like how the first dream story is James going to furry prison
Nice video
Wow just as maaz was about to do his own genshin add a real YouTube genshin add played
THE FIRST STYLE LOOKS SO ADORABLE
0:35
9:19 if i dreamed of this i would wake up and run away, i never saw a flying cockroach clearly and i never will
I don’t have dreams :>
Let me explain studios has no Mouth and you have no eyes
What the hell does Odd do with AMaazing in bed? 9:45
I once had a dream about two imp demons, whom I named Ramu and ester, that appeared to random ppl and offereed to play hide and seek w them. U had to hide and ester had a time limit on how long he can take to find u. If u win u get a reward or something. If u lose Ramu kills u. I added some of that into the characters, but in the original dream they appeared every night to specific house and played the game every night. The man who lived there became accostâmes to it and would often find places ester never looked and continuously beat him at the fame
oh my otp collabed
The second story just sounds like the book the 5 kingdoms
dude met flumpty
Giant egg...Why does it remind me of Flumpty?
The start Is alredy great
I just realized the background 😳😳😳
Partydave i loike it
I want to see psychologists analyze this
The registration suck. I tried two time and it did,t work):<
“Hi there I’m flumpty I’m an egg and I’m immune to the plot” that’s what I’m assuming the thumbnail is based on
I love the last dream. Pure genius.       *Anyways it time to get up*
GENSHIN IMPACT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had a dream where I got eaten by a fish which got eaten by another fish  which got eaten by another fish which got eaten by a orca which got eaten by- yea that dream kept going it was weird
0:54 I would be very surprised if someone other then me got who this is meant to be  (airoah)
In Hawaii, we have flying cockroaches but we call them “49ers”💀
Genshin Impact has been the game everyone is RAVING about
Bruh these dreams are freakin WEIRD 😂 but are so freaking hilarious to me and idk why
8:50 just imagining it felt like torture, as someone who has phobia to roaches, and has had similar nightmares, that was painful ;-;
a dream i had over 10 years ago still scares to this day   i was europe i'm thinking italy or franc because i remember seeing a cobble stone road and the circus was in town and all the animals and performers turned into zombies and that's where it ended
When I saw the walls table and couch I thought I clicked a sus video
My dreams are like James' egg dream. My therapist is concerned tho, because I've grown a tolerance to them.
Flumty bumty
Man I love being a lucid dreamer man 🤣🤣🤣
I had a dream that had three parts two it and it involved me dying in epic combat.
I actually started writing my dreams down and totally reccomend it! I remember all the ones i wrote down vividly. Also, I've lucid dreamt before! I was completely awake and conscious with my eyes closed, and i was in a dream. I couldn't really control what I did in the dream, but i could control when to stop the dream, kind of like having a remote and watching a movie. I was so amazed at was happening and I was waiting for the perfect moment to wake up, and was watching myself in the third person. Once the toy i was holding in my hand started mutating, I chose to wake up and was like "woah thats cool" and then tried to re enter the dream but i couldnt TWT
7:11 no fucking way someone else remembers xiaolin showdown nowadays
Im very curious now if James played one night a flumpties to have that nightmare.
Its time to get up.
Casting couch
Don't worry James. I'm a furry too.
I like the wizard battle animation
E G G
The abaalding
One night at flumtys energy
Ben
I like how maaz’s magic dream has a species thats almost entirely like the Anodites from Ben 10
TheAMaazing in your dream where you where on the couch were watching CN
These are clean animations
I really like the art style of the ad
Nice
13:31 I didn't know your sleep paralysis demon was flumpty bumpty
I don't know if the egg dream is terrifying or hilarious
Weak
For the dragon dreams I couldn't help but think  🎶Dragon jail dragon jail come one and join dragon jail🎶
I had a wierd dream once and this was when I was like 5  So it started off normal me and my frend were talking in my room playing with cars then I hear a bell then all of a sudden my friends eye turn to dogs wich scared me then I see it the Teddy bear that I always slept with because it was the only thing that stopped my nightmares and it jumped in my face then I Black out then its later in the day I'm talking to my parents when I hear the bell ring again same stuff happens then I'm at school I hear the bell ring but this time when the Teddy bear jumps on my face I don't black out so I call for help but no one responded then I black put and wake up and the Teddy bear I sleep with to stop the nightmares is gone    Also another one I had when I was 4 before I had the Teddy bear to stop my nightmares I found my self in the bathroom just standing there with jug full water on the side of the bath so I pour it out then every object in the room big or small starts flying at me so I run into the next room wich was the kitchen and now there are more things flying at me and I call for help but nothing and I don't reamber the rest all I know is that these nightmares even all these years later I can still reamber them
So many ads!!!
2:21 is that Fwench Fwy?
0:36 That scene is a bit sus, ngl.
I wanna try to record my dreams too. I did started once but since I'd never read what I wrote I stopped
i rarely dream and i mean rearely i think the last time i had a dream was about 6 months ago or something i dont remember it  i do remember one werid dream i had like 5 years ago. i was at my friends house in their kitchen sitting down at the table there was only a spotlight on as it was shning on a ham sandwich. i took off the bread (for some reason idk) and looked at the ham slice. it had a picture of a cat on it. not like someone just put a photo on top of it it was like actually ingraved in the ham. i started crying my eyes out and then woke up... yeah idfk
When the elephant picnic candles the lid
The code doesnt work!
I remember this one dream where: People, Wierd elemental badge thing, Mini spaceship crashes, bandage and adrenaline, my school teachers, then it switched over to: me have ipad and ak 47, people chase me with gun, I go through secret mirror door to room, I have teammate who is also there on a bed in that room, I ask him if he is gonna help me deal with the people outside, then wierd roblos animation where it shows me and my buddy just going BRRATATATTATATATATATA, then I wake up, after I woke up I said: what the f###, then I went back to sleep.
if you wanted weird dreams you should have just asked me.
I remember I had this recurring dream for about 6 months straight where I woke up from my bed and saw a very bright flash of light then a giant slimy lizard came out running directly at me then eats me where I sit in it's mouth holding on for my life trying to not slide down its throat and eventually I would slide down it's throat into its stomach wake up in a cold sweat hyperperventalating (I Totally spelled that wrong but idc) and slowly go back to sleep having a different dream until the morning of there's anyone who specializes in this area then please tell me WHY
I liked every single art style evry single one
My most lucid Dreams are like: I meet a girl, we get married, get along, have 2 kids, fight a dragon, shoot the dragon , start a cult, bake a cake.(all the characters change faces from cutscene to cutscene and I don't bother, example, scene 1 wife is aqua, scene 2 wife is zero two, scene 3 wife is my best friend, scene 4 is Amy from sonic)
JESUS CHRIST James's last dream was creepy. You could add more depth and backstory to that dream and make it a full creepypasta.
When I dream I just fall on the bed it's like when I am scared in a dream in real life i jump on the bed in sleeping position. No I don't stand I just jump in sleeping position it's like I am flying and just fell down thi always happens in my real life i have bad dream.
Genshin impact be like:
pika 1:31 doggo james=mad
I was trying to play a game with my brother to build are bond, until I say this video in my Notification Center
I had a dream where I was being chased by mike wazowski
I feel so bad for the alien girl, she just wanted to see water and now she's frozen in a coma.
I had this one weird dream where I was playing minecraft pocket edition (I'm going somewhere with this I promise) and I encased a creeper with tnt and blew it up, but it turned gray, had this weird face, and it had spinning helicopter legs. It slowly hovered down into this 1*1 hole that led straight to the nether, which was basically a huge flat plain with really tall nether portals, more of those weird gray creepers, and this giant zombie pigman with a whip that I'm pretty sure was from an unofficial minecraft book.
Wait what’s the original video that James made?
I like writing down my dreams. But most of them are just me or someone else dying. Wait I think those are supposed to be nightmares.
WHY DOES THE DRAGON PRISON ONE SOUND LIKE A DATING SIM
I do not know  what pop brownies are, but from context it sounds very shady...
Anyone gonna bring up that James was just casually at a villain meeting    Sounds fun
“Zootopia Tiger”  Ahhhh shit this is gonna be good😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:24 Maaz looks high
I use to lucid dream all the time then I became an insomniac but now I'm medicated I should do it again lol
One time i dreamed something bad- l lets just say somebody i hate with all my soul is dead-
Nice Video
I love all the different animation styles
Bro I don’t dream so this is really wired
3:53 Best part of the vid
Not related to the video but- ANY FELLOW VENTI SIMPS HERE
Aquaman
The furry jokes about james are just too good
something is telling me Maaz simps for Eula and i don't know why
I've had some strange reaccuring dreams. Their is one where I wander through a jungle and the forest floor is covered in snakes on snake always stands out it has a teal colored body and orangeish yellow head kinda like corn. I also have one where I am a demigod in the percy jackson universe and in the dream I have a sword that is like riptide and every time I come across a arch covered in moss it looks worn away and sometimes I end up fighting a monster. I have had a few more reaccuring dreams but I can't recall them right now.
Wizard Duel sounds like a great concept for a series or something. Great video and all the animations were wonderful!
One of my latest dreams was...  I was staring at a clean toilet.   That's it, not plot twists, no plot lines. Just me and this clean toilet.
Once, I had a dream that I was 7 years old again, and had finally finished melting the last popsicles and lollipops in a jug of hot water after doing so for a week. Keep in mind, this dream was during the peak of the Queensland floods. Then, I got all the tape we had, prepared to get the sticks to tape them together, and noticed they were gone! "Mum? Where are my popsicle sticks and lollipop sticks? I was gonna make a raft!" "Ooooh. Sorry baby, I threw them all in the recycling." "I filled all the lollipop sticks with toothpicks so they wouldn't flood! I emptied out whole jugs! I made a graveyard smoothie from lollipop and popsicle juice!" And that was my dream. I probably had it because my parents threw out my sticky hand even though I was going to wash it when it broke.
i only remember 2 of my dreams 1, i was falling and hit a dining table that was outside 2, ochako and deku from mha/bnha saved me from getting robbed   Edit: i love how your dreams have a plot, mine don't lol
That egg was so scary wth Like fr I-
I once had a dream that my cat laid an egg. In that same dream my basement was a swamp and everyone I know was canoeing through the river in my swamp basement. Later I have the egg in my hands and my dad breaks it open and the insides were black goo…
I had a strange nightmare where I fell into a puddle of water on the sidewalk, and then I started falling through multiple rock formations. It looked nice, which was weird because I was like scared about falling and hitting the one of the rocks but also taking in the lush greens around me, the vibrant islands all around, and the weather was sorta cloudy. There was also a random school bus parked on one of the islands. Anyways I was falling perfectly through small holes to the base of the rock formation, and as soon as I hit the ocean I wake up.
You're my dream Maaz 💗🌚💗
511th comment
this counts a dream but still a nightmare of nyctophobia. (That I still remember and will hunt me forever) ok so this begins of my family driving to somewhere. I was wondering where my family is going but I let them be. Then I felt I need to pee badly, I asked my parents and they will find the nearest gas station. Once they found one they parked and I get out of the car and enter the station. I asked the worker for a key to the restroom. The worker gave me the key and I left to use the restroom. After I'm done using the restroom I smelled something disgusting. It was rotten flesh. I used the mask and turn on the flashlight on my phone because I found a secret door leading to a secret room. I went in and saw the horror in my eyes. Bunch of dead human body's and few are alive but still weak. I walked and looked around to see what happened there. I felt something grabbed my leg that makes me startled and turned to who touched me. It was a weak girl who's begging for help. I helped her get up to gain her balance, once she gains her balance I told her to get more people who are still alive and get out of there. She did as I told as I continued to explore. I saw a light and went there, as I got there I see few papers and weapons with blood. I began to read the papers and saw a picture who's behind this mess. It was a gas station guy. I imeatally  left and called 911. They asked few questions and told were I'm at. The police arrived and arrested the gas station person who killed lots of bodies and get away from it while the other cops investigate the secret room I found. The cops told me questions about what happened down there. Although I don't know what happened down there I asked the cops to tell a girl who I helped earlier. They let the girl get a free ride back to her home and I walked to my family. What really happened from that room? We will never know... :o)
That egg reminds me of someone...
DRAGON JAIL DRAGON JAIL ITS ALMOSTT TIME FOR DRAGON JAIIIIL
Can we get a moment of silence for poor knee-les Luigi?
Nah max plays he shin impact
weird
Talking while sleep:"Free the discord kitty"
I would watch the first one if it were a movie or show😭 How to train your dragon to break out of prison
Aqua man the best dream ever
YASSSS GENSHINNN (also this was bugging me the whole time yae was gone by the time you posted this)
Once when I was younger I had this weird dream where I was at my house in my room I walked my brothers room and my crush who had recently left my school well I really old school I left that school too and I was in my new house that I am living in right now and I’m gonna call him Conor that’s not his real name now Conor had said to me don’t say peas for some reason so I shouted peas and giant peas was raining from the sky so me and my family huddled up in my room because it was apparently the safe place and then my roof collapsed and then I woke up. Very weird dream
A dream I had was that I woke up in a wooden house, ran into the jungle, and immediately fell off a cliff and died
Dreams are highly underrated
Hey Maaz can you do more Maria series?
Another dream cause i classes
I swear these 2 make the funniest colabs
James got 4 eyes Also two more words Monty fnaf And two more words werehog sonic
Another weird thing maz sponsored by gensin impact and I literally got gensin an impact ad
I had a dream I was on the toilet peeing and when I woke up I was literally peeing and I was like oh my god
I couldn't stop laughing when they were getting in the bed together
Yes
i don’t know why but i haven’t had a nightmare for  several years. I’ve had scary dreams, but in the end I’m always just like, “Wait a minute, why am I scared of you?” N out to long ago actually I was in this house/ball pit/bouncy house place, and this blue dog was murdering my relatives, and I was just like, “This is fine.” When it came after me though I always put smarted it, and actually killed it instead. Multiple times. uhh…..
Why is that every time James and maaz do a collab they’re on trial
Chicken 🐔
Ooga booga
I don’t really have dreams. Rather sometimes I get “glimpses of the future” that I forget, and when that event that I “saw” occurs, I get a sense of Deja Vu.  Sometimes I also get weird ideas to draw but I’m just too unmotivated, too lazy, or I just forget about it to actually draw it.
James just encountered Flumpty in the last dream
the animation at 10:25 was good
I'm never touching am egg again....
Im only at the intro but im exited to watch this!
I remember a choice few dreams, but only one truly sticks out. A friend of mine and myself were chasing a gingerbread man through a forest on broomsticks. That's it. That's the dream.
I wish I could animate my dream journal. Been keeping it for years and its my pride and joy cause its so wild
This is the reason I keep a dream log. Never know when you’ll need your dreams. And you know lucid dreaming.
The egg sounds like one night at flumpty's
bro i am not even joking i had a dream I was in a forest fighting giant demon baby's
Question, can we get a sequal to the "Wizard World" story?
THIS WAS SO MUCH FUN AAH! PLEASE DONT PEE!
Yeah
I get really sad dreams and then I get a dream about happiness the next day. I don’t get my dreams.
I had a dream that I was walking around this scary-looking mansion, when I heard a thud behind me, and I saw a huge alligator-like this thing was huge! then it started to cash me. and you now that feeling you get in your dream when your running rally fast until you notice then your legs become heavy, so that happen, and I looked to my right when I saw a little table with a flower vase and I just throw it at the alligator because that's going to slow it down lol, and after I throw it, it made a loud sound and woke up because I had thrown my glasses case across my room. my glasses were fine, now I have to use a broken container for them, but anyway I loved the video and the different styles of animations it was awesome it felt like actually being in a dream lol
9:24 flying cockroaches are real.  we got them in California bruh
my friend gave me a pot brownie. we both didn't know because he got them from a friend HE JUST MEET.  i just trusted him cuz he said they where his, and later this "friend" of his asked if he shared the brownies and she told him and they both just looked  at me,  I WAS JUST STANDING THERE XD and realized why my stomach hurt XD. nothing weird happened my stomach just hurt for a bit  i was ok
oke
Anyone know the place in the Genshin ad at 3:21? Looks like a gloomy factory and I don’t think I’ve seen it before
im pretty sure Maaz and James might do something after they ate pot brownies in bed.  | :)
I had a weird dream last night. I was being chased by a pickle zombie
Yess you guys always make the best collabs. I love your guys's videos
Sounds to me like the plan to break out of dragon prison totally worked.
Can I just record me sleeping cause I talk in my sleep.
Love how his glasses are basically just his eye sockets
My dream was about me being depressed but there is a twist is was not a dream
E
I like the animation from Party Dave
I had a dream where I jumped off a bridge. Another time I had a dream where a dog got eaten by ants that looked like Larry the Lobster and then the dog turned into legos. Another time I dreamed I was in the woods and Darth Vader had adopted a bunch of children and then Iron Man beat him up. Another time, Pennywise bit my trachea out.
Technically a nightmare, but oh well  So I was chilling in the living room, and I see this random guy hunched over in the backyard calling someone. I panic and try to call 911, but then he sees me and breaks into the house and takes my phone. He keeps telling me to “call his buddy” but I didn’t know the number and didn’t want to anyways, so I kept saying no. Eventually he takes out this knife and slits my throat, and I fall to the floor. I see him go up the stairs where my family is, and then I die and wake up. I still remember how it felt, which was not good. 0/10 would not recommend. Oh and it also made me paranoid about going into the living room until we moved.
Wait maaz likes genshin impact  Didnt know he was a pedophile
Damn. I can't believe you dreampt up a whole ass reverse isekai.  That would legit make a really good concept for an anime or manga/comic.

7:12 The Jack Spicer cameo was highly unexpected but very welcome.

I had  FRECKY dream was well someone tuched the back of my and I freacked out and then I woke up and felt it in real life look around none was there!!!!
papa
If they would just put genshin impact on the Nintendo switch! Aaaaaahh. My iPad can’t handle the awesomeness of genshin..
Perfect timing, i just woke up from a nightmare today and Im so happy you guys are making a dream video to help me not think about it.
As much as recording your dreams is a good idea, it kinda sucks when you wake up and completely forget what you’ve dreamt about  Or is it just me 💀
Ah yes the small yet formidable villain GOOMBA
Sorry I'm 1 hr late my friend was crying and can we appreciate the smooth animation
13:22 needs to be fully drawn in great detail so I can have nightmares :)
I could not stop laughing at that egg one
AYO MR ODD 4K
So i was not supposed to hear them talk
Genshin impact is also breath of the wild but cringe
13:27.                                                                                       Shadow monster man. If u know, u know
I'm FINALLY early and also furries in mayonnaise.
Who needs dragon tails when you have dragon jail Call back to odd1sout vid
The egg was flumpty bumpty
Hell yeah this is great!!
XD
There have been dreams I had where I was partially blind or my eyelids were extremely squinted, and I would try to open them to get a better view of what was going on, but that meant  I would be trying to open up my REAL eyes while I was dreaming making it impossible, the best example of this was when I had a dream when I was driving the s s dolphin with Louie from Pikmin, and since the hocotatians eyes are always squinting, it was hard to see.
great video!!!!!!!!!!
Zootopia tiger 🤣
The Emperor was HERE yo
ok.... here is the thing everyone watching this. Yae miko is no longer avaible because her banner has already passed...justs to be clear for people who don't see why they cant get her
i wish i had dreams like that, i can easily recall some of the odd dreams ive had but they barely make sense
The most dreams I probably had is me being a power ranger
7:14 OMFG JACK SPICER FROM WAS AMAZING  XIAOLIN CHRONICLES WAS MY CHILDHOOD
This made my day yay! Thanks guys 😁😁 its so funny!?!
The first one is similar to the first wings of fire book lol
Bro, i wanna be dreaming like u
I really like the pee story and it's animation
My weirdest dream ever: Me and my friends were on this little playground swing set. All of a sudden this giant spaceship comes out of nowhere and blows up a nearby house, and sudden gravity turns off. Then these weird humans in purple outfits come down from the spaceship and start arresting my friends. Then, for no reason, I turn into a frog, and am put into 3rd person. The scene shifts, and it’s a prison. I assume it was inside the spaceship, but as one of the people locks up one of my friends, she looks at me and shouts, “We missed one!” She tries to grab me, but I do a flip to the side. All of a sudden time slows, and a deep, narrative voice from nowhere says, “No one could catch John Wick the Frog, especially not with that mayonnaise you put on your Character Sheet.” Then I woke up. Weirdest dream ever
One time In a dream, I had a really wired dream, what happened was I was eating a bowl of cereal and there where British robots and I spilled the bowl of cereal and all the British robots then got really mad and they tried to kill me.
Yeah, I had a dream, I was a sponge bob character and I went to the bathroom in my dream. And it felt so good, but then I woke up and peed myself ;v;
When the notification came out I read: *I ANIMATED OUR WEDDING* LOL
Once I had one of those dreams that turns into a nightmare. It's morning, me and my sister are home alone, we walk into the family room, and there are a bunch of snakes, a bunch of nonvenomous snakes, and me and my sister are confused at first, but then are OK with it because there's a huge thing of cookies in the kitchen, and the snakes are being good. It was chill at first, but then out of freaking nowhere the biggest snake decides they hate me, and bites my foot. It keeps coming for me, and the other 3 to 5 snakes decide they wanna bite my feet, too, so I stand on the table, because the kitchen is right next to the family room. In front of me is a whole bin full of bags of homemade chocolate chip cookies that have oats (it's delicious!!). There is a beehive somewhere in the house, because there are a lot of bees, in the dream. Now, I'm terrified right now, as I should be because snakes want to bite me out of nowhere. Now, in this dream my sister is present, and we're both really... mixed up about this. Nothing is bothering her, it's just me. I wanted some cookies, but there is a swarm of bees in front of the bin. The big snake launches at my foot, and I jump off the table, dodging it. Then, midair, a bee comes at my face, the dream goes into 3rd person view sometimes, and this was one of those times. The bee is flying and stings me right on the chin. I woke up right as the stinger touched me, and right before the pain. This was a VERY vivid nightmare, it was the first nightmare that scared me so much that I woke up from it. I realized later on that I was hyperventilating in real life the same way I was in the dream. I've had some pretty bad nightmares, but this one was super vivid, as if I was living it, I think one of my feet hurt just the tiniest bit when I woke up. Just one of those chill dreams that turns into a chaotic nightmare in just a few seconds. I was really glad after I woke up and was able to calm down after knowing it wasn't real.
Literally just got off genshin impact to match this and well guess what the videos sponsored by genshin impact themselves
I have been waiting for Maaz to upload for so long.
Yay finally another video
0:05 kinda sus. also 0:45 and 11:10
Lolol
WAIT IM KINDA EARLY 🙊 Also I love this duo 😎
I was not expecting no legs Luigi
Can someone please explain the term "pot brownies." I have 2 brain cells and they are making all the worst guesses.
theres always that one dream you get over and over again and cannot escape
POG
Main villain guy with the actual best roast ever
I don't think I've ever been this early
Yooooo
imagine if james and maaz were both in furry prison.
3:54
I keep havingf nightmares about being unable to find a bathroom, then waking up needing to pee, really badly, precedes to run to the bathroom so fast i get a headache...
can you do mothey 3
I love how your animation quality developed ✨✨✨👏👏👏👏👏👏
2:42 after midnight in my country here.......was about to go to bed until I saw u uploaded 🙂🙂kill me✨
Cool
no offence but the game is just a copy of loz-botw and is just not as good trust me I have played both and legend of zelda-botw is better
My dream of  Maaz as my Prince Charming 🤤🤤🤤  Wait what! What I say ?
I love whenever one of your new videos drop. It really inspires me to animate. Also, I play Genshin Impact with my friends and to all those who think that they can find another like it, I say don't try. It has no equal in quality, price or availability in my opinion. Again, Thank you for the new video, Maaz and nice to see another collab with James.
I once had a really short dream where I was Tom Holland spiderman, in bed talking to myself, and there was a light just outside my room's door, that was just swinging, i could see it throught a window in the wall, then I stopped talking to myself and all of the sudden, something bursts out of the closet, i then close my eyes, it was making a weird noise and I assume that it was moving around the room rapidly because the noise was changing in volume, then I woke up outta fear
omg love it so much so funny thank you for the great content
Hi I love your videos I wanna be just like you when I get older
:)
That is so weird because I had some crazy dreams last night. I know I dream a lot but the night before this video was uploaded had some MAD dreams
These guys dreams are so interesting they could literally base shows off of them and they would make bank
😳 0:00
When James said "I have two words to say" my wireless earbuds said "battery low" 🤣
I had a dream that my online friend turned into a giant gummy octopus, and she was screaming "THESE AREN'T TENTACLES, THESE ARE PENISES"
I saw "weirdest dreams" in the title and the first 20 seconds of the video, is an accurate description on what I thought would happen.
Jeesh, Dreams are weird for sure… 😂
Yeeeeaaahhh boooiiii
That last dream, I can actually hear the trumpets
Lucid nightmares being a possibility is why I do not try for lucid dreams. Nightmares are already bad enough.
Early!!!
Early
I once had a dream that I was in college lesson. After a certain time, the wind outside began and it grew stronger and stronger each second until the entire class felt some trembling beneath and right after the entire classroom began to spin with everyone inside. It was like that for a minute and then we hit the landing. We walk out of the classroom and turns out that we are now on a tourist part of a mountain in our town. The sky was covered in black clouds, the wind was very strong to the point that trees een pulled out from the ground. me and the class began to move to some hiding spot and then, the another nearby mountain in out city began to erupt and everyone who wa near the railings on this tourist trail began to burn alive as the lava from the mountain began to run near our position. The dream ended that one of the rocks from the mountain fell on me.
The first three would make for pretty sick DnD scenarios, not gonna lie.
If I saw that egg in a nightmare or a dream I'll be like you're going to be my breakfast in the morning
ITS ALSO SPONSORED BY GENSHIN IMPACT
I love Genshan impact
The intro was very interesting
36 minutes and already 2.5K likes😂
Is it just me or is the first s of maz's dream when he was a wizard mage seemed like the first seconds of gensin impact
Now I want to say my dream cause these are pretty cool. I'll try to shorten it. In my dream everytime I went to sleep I'd be brought to another dream world with other people. This dream in a dream was dangerous, if you died in the dream you never came back so it was basically a bunch of kids fearing to fall asleep or else they'll get slaughtered. Eventually on our journey we decided to meet up when we woke up from the dream in a dream. But everytime I was late at the meet ups and never could see them. After adventuring in the dream dream world we learned that this world was good once. What happened is that this little girl who had magic was mistreated by her dad and everyone hated her... one day her dad beat her to the brink of death and she became a moster of hatred. Her skin turned white and her hair turned into a big mass of black oily void. But because she was a child she hopped that someone would save her from herself. So much that she summoned kids from another planet. After some time we found a way to kill her, bringing her to peace, and that was to sing a lulaby that her mom sung to her. There was a catch though, someone in the really world had to sing it, not from the dream world, our world. Turns out the people that I was meeting up with weren't even in my dream world and that if I ever reached the meeting places no one would be there. I started to sing the song but woke up. I remember when I was waking up the girl cried out, "No please don't wake up!" I never had the dream again ;-;
When me, SomethingElseYT, AND the AMaazing uploads on the same day: 🤯🤯🤯
Had 3 mini dreams with their own plots a week earlier. It was like I was channel flight movies to watch the first half before switching to the next at the climax. Dream 1: I got tricked into being controlled by talking water controlling fish so they could destroy a fishing town as revenge for their fish bretheren. Dream 2: There was a group of people that had a mission to convince this conductor of the rain train (a train that makes it rain) to quite driving the train in such a small circle and to start traveling again. Unfortunately the conductor developed a fear of traveling after the loss of his friend Dream 3: Lego toys time travel to save their other lego friend that died somehow.
“Zootopia Tiger” perfect for Maaz to be accused for being a dancing tiger fan.
E
Nerds ha I'm cool 😎
Can we all appreciate the skill of this animator? Maaz is a legend! :D
Soup is ireland
James’ sister looks just like Bubbles from powerpuff girls lol
Yes
Lillol
I once dreamt of going to the toilet and taking a pee... But I just realised that I couldn't hear my pee going in the toilet water... And I woke up wetting the bed
POGGGG
Wow
Poggers
The Egg’s “Time to Get Up” song almost made me cry laughing 😂
am i the only one who cant redeam the code
I remember a dream where I was in school with a lot of cartoon characters and I gave birth and my teacher said that I am about to die but before my teacher called the ambulance I woke up. At the time I was a 12 year old guy.
The video Idea we've been waiting so long for is finally here!!!😆
YO MAAZ
Nobodies gonna question why James was at a convention of villains? I mean, I guess it makes sense?
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Wait... why are you two on a casting couch...
The amazing with theodd1sout is fantastic also funny youtubers
youtube put me an ad at every 2 min... I'm going crazy
He dreams about that nad the first video being made getting destroyed
Are we just ignore how much detail goes into the story board? It’s gorgeous
AMAZING VIDEO MAAZ
My weirdest dream (that I remember) isn’t really THAT weird…  It just consisted of a giant Venus Flytrap plant growing in my kindergarten school while I’m running around trying to find help to destroy it. One of the classrooms I ran into had my teacher and 2 or 3 students, but they were holograms (and I mean like the ones from Star Wars that were blue). Then, I ran through a door that lead to a swimming pool (the school wasn’t actually like that irl). At one point in the hallway, I ran past the Animaniacs and Teen Titans, as well (thank god they were the original cartoon version, otherwise it would’ve made the dream weird). Then I woke up.  It was pretty realistic, so I didn’t even know I was in a dream and couldn’t wake up.
Me: I’m finally early for once    *sniffs out manly tears*
One night early this week, I had 3 dreams that had their own plot like 3 mini movies. In my first dream, I was visiting a fishing town on a body of water that had signs to not touch the water, and I saw an abandoned net that was stuck with a lot of fish. I try to free the fish, I fall in, a swarm of other fish whirls around, water starts climbing up on me. I grab to pull myself up, but the fish tell me that they can control water and help me bend water, they just need have a layer of water on me so they could swim around me as I walk. I think I agree and then the water covers my head and I think I drowned because the dream was no longer from my pov and watched from the outside. The fish start bending the water to destroy the fishing town as revenge of killing their fish bretheren.
It's true dream journaling is one of the best things you can do for lucid dreaming. Also a lucid dreaming video would be great, it's the greatest skill you can learn and not enough people know about it
The egg nightmare one made me burst out laughing, wtf? 🤣
If wetmoneoon was an animator I would definitely watch him.
there real dream my pure chaos
1 year ago i had a real nightmare! (i dont have any nightmares i remember besides this) A good friend of mine is a trained chef. In that dream it felt like i wasn't myself. I was more like a psychopath/out of my mind/ insane. Me and my friend where at my parents house, sitting on the kitchen floor and i chopped up my dog and we cooked something out of that... then i woke up... i cried for like half an hour and felt like the most miserable pice of sh*t on this planet even tho i knew that it was "just a dream." For that short time it felt like i really killed my dog despite knowing its an illusion.  (the dog doesnt even live with my parents... he's with me... currently snorting and probably hunting some bunny in his dreams because he moves his legs in his sleep like that and (verry slightly barks) while asleep)
Once, I had a dream that thermometer guns worked like real guns…
i just wanna know what the zootopia tiger is, but I'm guessing it's something to do w/ Maz simping for it??
oddisout?
Exuse use me!? FURRY PRISON!? Uh okay 👌 makes sense
I wonder if james saw a dragon called a rainwing and i think he was trap in hes sleep
I have weird dreams like these bruh 💀
Give me some brownies
I like PartyDave’s.  The whole thing is nothing but sketches 😂
I recently had a dream where I was playing “Hide and Seek” with Groot, Pennywise, and the Joker.
Of course Maaz would have a wizard world dream, it’s just so him!
Just saying, the first two dreams would make for really good cartoons/anime. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't watch a whole series about dragons breaking out of prison.
lolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
I like abnormalchaoses chapter :)
YAY DREMS
I had a dream were my bed was moved to the middle of my room and it had no windows or doors and there were toy lining the wall moving on their own, then I woke up and was like “That was strange.”
both the world and CHARACTERS are pure eye candy. - Maaz
11:20 EREN JEAGER?!
SLAYYY GENSHIN IMPACT
intro : intro  dragon prison : jail genshin impact : sponsor wizard duel : magic magic go brrrrrrrrrrr perfect monsters : every villain ever in a nutshell Cockroach : scary things haha Pee : everyone until they were 8 years old Pot brownies : magic brownies  Aquaman : aquaman  Sleep : your mother getting you up What did you learn today : everything about my life
Not so fun fact: In Florida we actually do have flying cockroaches, and they’re huge. Their called Palmetto bugs and they are so scary because you think,”Oh, a cockroach, let me smash it or spray it,” but by the time you get within killing range, it jumps up and starts flying. They’re horrible.
Am I the only one who can't get the code?
i got here 17 mins after post i think
Hey
Early
I love how every story has a different style from different animators! It makes the stories more unique.  Amazing video!
I love your vids and the oddsonesout
Hi
I remember that I was falling to the space and splat to the earth I wake up jumping so high. So high I touched the ceiling. And this is the most insane dream I have ever have
11MINS AGO(! AOAIOWISD
I started with wanting to watch this because they are two of my favorite animators and the video was already perfect beyond imagination but now that one of my favorite games is here in the video I'm even happier now. I just love Genshin so much and having 3 things I love and enjoy together in one video is too much for my heart, I'm literally exploding of happiness XD
James' dreams are so bizarre lol.  Thank you for those tips at the end, maybe if follow those I'll dream more often and remember my dreams when I do have any.
BRUH THE EGG
I love how slowly every story time animator is going to be sponsored by Genshin
I barely even dream let alone remember them
I've only had this dream twice. I'm not one to typically have dreams, either.  I was running through a jungle and this middle-aged man was chasing me and I was literally running for my life. I don't remember much about the dream but there was this one part where he cornered me, kind of like those action movies. Then he did that whole "come with me or you'll regret it" things and I glanced around me as he came closer like I was a beast he was trying to tame. I look left: a canyon and more jungle on the other side with a waterfall cascading down around the corner. I look right: tangled vines and rough bushes. What do I do?  I FRIKIN JUMP LEFT.  Last thing I remember was the man's enraged screams as I fell. Then I woke up.😂
12 minutes ago!
Tw: murder  My weirdest dream was getting my throat sl!t by a fake Disney villain at my local church while the rest of my jr high class got food from a potluck table 😃
mmmmmmmmmmm yes. furry prison.              let me b with my bretheren.
I wish my dreams were like this
This is why I say people treat Luigi like he's nothing that's meanies
Everyone should learn how to lucid dream. The only problem is there's allot of misinformation
Maaz first dream animation is ass.
I don't think Maaz knows some cockroaches can fly in real life 👀
“I went to jail for 2 years for hitting someone. And as I was walking through the jail cell, I realized that it was a jail for dragons” *Uh oh… James’ dragon tail phases is back..*
Who thinks some of these stories should be anime or animated shows
hi maaz keep up the good work
Hi
My weirdest dream was when I was in an 80s arcade game with chucky 😳

I love pausing every few seconds to appreciate the small little details Maaz and the crew add in! You are really inspiring and one of the best YouTube animators I have seen,  despite having a million subscribers I believe your extremely underrated, keep it up! :)
Furry prison dreams😻😻😻😻⁉️⁉️
I had a dream where I had to be quiet cause there was something that hates me or people talking
Dreams are amazing and highly underrated. I highly recommend lucid dreaming to everyone
Time to Dream about furries
Yes yes yes Pog
James & Mazz's Dreams: Dragon Furry Prisons & Monsters getting abducted into the ocean         My Dreams: *Flamingo interfering with them every time I'm just trying to sleep* (Not kidding Albert is in my dreams..) 😶

YOU GOTTA LOVE THESE VIDS MAN
My weirdest dream was I jumped off a 10 story building pretending to die just to be woken up my pennywise licking my neck 😐
James and Maaz have dreams that no sane person should ever witness.
I love the animation on here
that's nice, Maaz.
Got the new character in my first ten wishes
i watched this the minute it was posted
I had a dream where I was using the bathroom, but then i woke up in my bed with something wet on my bed :))
One dream I had which is honestly more comparable to a nightmare was where I was with my family in front of some store I think. A random girl with long black hair and horns grabs and throws me down to the ground. My father goes up to her and grab her by her collar than she started to rip my family apart. And as soon as I get up she rips off a car door and throw it at me tearing off my arm in the process. I ask why and she tells me "I'm not him, not yet" and soon as I died from blood loss I woke up.
Liked and commenting while sitting through ads to support you
Remember kids... wear a seatbelt.
YESSSS FINALLY EVKSAKSHSJKS ILY
I missed this duo❤️
Shame on you James and Maaz
at a buffet, i personally sneak corndogs into the buffet so others can enjoy them. I hide 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. it then, is a joy for me to see other patrons of the establishment eat my corndogs thinking they were part of it
This video in a nutshell:  Everyone: you really say that? Him: *"did I stutter?"*
I love when mazz uploads  I just love these videos
A N I M A T E D
How many people commented on this in the first 2 minutes
*"Your honer, im guilty. Take me to furry prison."*
Odd1sout, AMMazing, Jaiden Animations, Wolfychu, Edd Gould, Let me Explain studios, and Haminations are all the best animators ever who agrees?

OMG I HAVEN’T SEEN YALL FOR LIKE 4 YEARS
My favourite dreams song to listen to before I dream  I'm malicious, mean and scary My sneer could curdle dairy And violence wise, my hands are not the cleanest But despite my evil look And my temper, and my hook I've always yearned to be a concert pianist Can't ya see me on the stage performin' Mozart Ticklin' the ivories 'til they gleam? Yep, I'd rather be called deadly For my killer show tune medley Thank you 'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream He's got a dream He's got a dream See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem Though I do like breaking femurs You can count me with the dreamers Like everybody else I've got a dream I've got scars and lumps and bruises Plus something here that oozes And let's not even mention my complexion But despite my extra toes And my goiter, and my nose I really wanna make a love connection Can't you see me with a special little lady Rowing in a rowboat down the stream? Though I'm one disgusting blighter I'm a lover, not a fighter 'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream I've got a dream (he's got a dream) I've got a dream (he's got a dream) And I know one day, romance will reign supreme Though my face leaves people screaming There's a child behind it, dreaming  Like everybody else I've got a dream Tor would like to quit and be a florist Gunther does interior design Ulf is into mime Attila's cupcakes are sublime Bruiser knits, Killer sews Fang does little puppet shows And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns I have dreams like you, no, really Just much less touchy feely They mainly happen somewhere warm and sunny On an island that I own Tanned and rested and alone Surrounded by enormous piles of money I've got a dream (she's got a dream) I've got a dream (she's got a dream) I just wanna see the floating lanterns gleam And with every passing hour I'm so glad I left my tower Like all you lovely folks I've got a dream She's got a dream (he's got a dream) They've got a dream, we've got a dream So our differences ain't really that extreme We're one big team Call us brutal, sick, sadistic And grotesquely optimistic 'Cause way down deep inside We've got a dream I've got a dream I've got a dream I've got a dream I've got a dream I've got a dream I've got a dream Woo, woo, woo, woo Yes, way down deep inside I've got a dream Yeah
We all know you’re a furry at heart maaz
