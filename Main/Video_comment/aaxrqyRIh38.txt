Thank you for your candidness on how YOU are feeling Eamon. I can only imagine what’s going through your heart and mine as the caregiver and spouse watching the person you love in pain and agony.
lol @ Eamons song
I would LOVE to see Bec's "coloring book" mandalas on your Habit packaging....why not?  They are so pretty.  Also, if you ever have a boy-boy besides Oso, I think you should name him "Brio"....it's an Italian word that describes your attitudes toward life---Google it...I think it means zesty energy or the like and it's a fine play on the word emBrio as in Embryo, ya?  Way cool name when Franke gets a brother....sending love from Colorado
I'm so proud of you guys how you are handling this challenge. It's great to see a couple who are really made for each other and happy. ❤
Oso and the couch 😂
I love your channel
Oso with his couch and cone of shame is such a priceless main character 😂
Has anyone seen an update ,I miss them and so worried about the little baby
Came for the remodeling found myself caught up in the personalities. What a ride it’s been.
Watching back the videos @eamonandbec look how far you’ve come !! ❤
Your next video should be baby proofing the house
Poor dog
It is so hard on the other person you are such a great man too your girlfriend she is so lucky too have you you are such a angel 😇 god bless yous two ❤❤❤❤
With the beanie she looks just like Eleven from stranger things 😍
This was one my all time favorite videos! 😊
Control freak
Aww, poor Oso really loved that couch. Ha!
Ouuuu !! My place next ?? 😂😂 turned out beautiful!
Bec you are so strong and Eamen. You both fighting so hard and you guys are the best.<3❤
Bec is just lovely sans hair. Did she lose it everywhere?
I love you kidz. Now that my broken neck and diabetes Type I are making a stay at home out of me I live outside with you on your blogs. Thank You!
Please tell me what happened with the building code people and your lack of compliance. I want to know how this worked out for you! Thanks, kidz. Grandpapa, Michael
Oso: " if the couch goes, I go! "  (Idk if I spelled his name correctly)
A double collar of pool noodles makes a better deterent than the cone of shame.
I'm so sorry you went through that ,my husband died of lung cancer 12 years ago,just love her and kiss and hug every day ,I wish I could even just one more time!
OMG- what a great job on the entry porch/gym area. I absolutely love it, love it, love 💕 it.
Hahahaha, Oso is so funny with the satellite dish running around.
Hahaha, Oso did not want to see that couch moved out of the house. Lol.
Wow! That is a beautiful, functional space!!
We miss Bec but so happy to see her smile always
Prayers to you and your family❤❤❤
One of your best vlogs ever.
1:30 & 12:59 This dog is soooo adorably FUNNY without the intention of being funny. Had some good laughs throughout the video. Thank you! Awesome job with the renovation, Eamon! And thank you soo much for showing yourself vulnerable towards Bec's health rollercoaster/ journey. Much, much love to you both. I'm so happy she made it and you can continue to enjoy your young adventurous lives together! ❤🙏🏼🕯🍀
Keep your head up mate you’re my favourite YouTuber things will brighten up I hope you and your girlfriend are well send my love to Bex and tell her stay strong I know how it feels I lost my grandma from cancer and I know how hard it is just keep your head up be proud of yourself and give a big pat dog
I LOVE, LOVE , LOVE how involved both sides of the family are ❤
Hahahahah Oso is hilarious!! Between him not wanting the couch to go and that cone, I have been giggling so hard!!!😂😂😂
I'm dying inside wondering what you'll be up to next Sunday Bec, and what adventure Eamon will take us on. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am here for u both u both are strong uniquie  couple amazing strong special  ❤ u both keep me going wished I could really talk to u and van wives  as I am here alone my brother are far away lucky one brother came to help me out with knee replacement two  eye catrax then COVID hit he could go home he missed his family  he told me I am his family he was here one year  couple months I watch  ur blogs every day and rematch them I don’t have many friends u are my friends and family I forgot to tell u have a daughter she lives different province I don’t see her much plus I have my soulmate I don’t see her much because as I told u had to come home look after ages parents mom died 2007 and my father passed away four years ago I am alone

She loves it!!
Osso, you’re a crazy dog!!
We love you Eamon. Your the best. Keep busy, your so good at it. You are quite the handy man. i think you and Bec are the cutest couple ever. I know you guys will get thru this. Love you both very much. Cant wait for the wedding.
That dog is hilarious!!  Hes such a character. You guys should be ready for kids after him. Hes worse than a toddler. LOL.  But so adorable. Love you guys. Sending my love and prayers your way.
Eamon's a handyman! Looks amazing! You have full of skills buddy guy!
It is awesome how you both work so hard to make your home your home. You get to say you and your family and close friends built this place.
Just so very happy you are finished with chemo and Congratulations on finishing and getting your health back 💖💖💖🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖
For future dog cone needs, which I hope are not needed 🙏 Use a pool noodle, you can find guides to making them on the tube 😁
The room looks beautiful, I don't think is would have blocked the view with the weight wall, I would have built that against the cabin wall to one side of the double doors. Stay strong Bec and Eamon
Great job
Waoooo
Good
Stunning
It's absolutely amazing job you did you guys
Good
Gureat
Nice one
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for the update guys
Renovation
Great job
Nice vibes
Amazing
I love it so much
Oso ❤❤
❤️❤️❤️
Nice one
Love this blog
You boys did good!  Yay!!
Gob bless you
What kind of work boots are those ?
❤
Nice
I think that's one of the most precious things I've ever seen with Oso and that couch! <3 This is what I get for posting before finishing the whole video! How in the world did Oso get even cuter after the couch moment... he was so cute with the cone! I cannot deal with the cuteness overload.
Always love to see Tim!
Good
Eamon you are a strong rock and pillar for Bec. You both are so strong and resilient. I’m so proud and filled with love for the both of you. Keep being strong for each other!
Lmao! Osso is determined with the couch!!
Hello from Ontario, Canada the room looks awesome great job! Happy to hear you are feeling better Bec. 🤗❤🦋🇨🇦
Awesome filming and editing.  Epic video!
Watched again.  Love you guys.
You have a keeper there! (And I'm saying that to the both of you.) Even Oso is going through a hard time - first you remove his couch, then his balls, and, finally, he find one up in a tree. Man, that's rough! 😜
Best flip ever
Omg, Oso and the couch...so adorable. What a phenomenal communicator he is.
God is with you guys no matter what you do
OSo had me really cracking up x
The amount of times that eamon tells Oso to watch the camera is hilarious
❤❤❤
I’m glad you’re feeling better Bec.  I’m still praying for you and Eman.  Eman you’re so funny 😂 keep you head up too.
Eman what happened to the ladder you made?  I don’t see it anywhere. 😂
Bec please review your plant based food and make sure it is not high in estrogen like soy.. Have a very blessed day
Aww, Oso, u need ur couch don't u, angel?
I am so sorry that is happening to you . You don’t deserve this at all . Sending you all my prayers
Bec,you are beautiful inside and out. I just love the love that Eamon has for you. Y'all two are the sweetest
Wow 🤩
Love yall ❤️ 💓
Beautiful well done!! 💜🐕😂
I’m so happy for you both!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
An amazing transformation and an excellent job! Also glad to see how you-Eamon are supporting Bec so well. My wife is facing an L-VAD pump implant next week to aid her ailing heart so I have a good idea of what you've been dealing with. We men must support the women we love and watching this vid has helped me tremendously! Thank you both so much!
Eamon….. you are an incredible young man! Bec is very lucky to have you, your help and love! I know it’s hard to feel positive but it’s okay to allow yourself to have the emotions you do…. I know how hard this is on you….
Are you starving Oso? He is soooo funny when he gobbles down his food…. 😂.
Wait does the dog sleep outside?
You are both wonderful.  Love your house  love from 🇦🇺
TIMS BACKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think its so freaking amazing you are all doing this project.   **edit** Omg oso and that couch.   Eamon you do not owe anyone any kind of explanation but that you for sharing how you feel. I'm such a baby watching these I'm always crying it seems but I'm crying with you. You are such a stong and beautiful man and so so loving. You two are so good together and overcomming this will be a huge blessing in not just your lives but everyones. Maybe the next camp space you go to buy will be a recovery center? Idk what I said that. I just felt really compelled too =?  I love Coach's response of no problem to that huge stack of boards.
Eamon and Bec is so strong, lots of best wishes fron UAE for both...super...perfect couple👍👍👍
Hahahaha Oso is the funniest dog ever 😂😂
“You got a problem with that building inspector?🧐” I laughed🤪  I’m glad that you both are finding joy in the little things and making sure you’re taking care of your self and each other. Sending love 💛
So happy to see Bob😃
What happened to your black lab? Compliment: Good job on the mini-loft, main loft, and everything.
Hi guys! My mom is also struggling with cancer and me watching you guys helps me know my family is not alone, and neither is yours :) both so strong and  a big inspiration to all.
Presume as you've done this project that the permits and relationship with the building inspector is finally smoothed over? The new porch looks beautiful
It would be really cool to see a video of the previous owners of the cabin getting a tour of everything you guys have achieved there !
What are you gonna do with the new cabin ??
Lol, those plastic cones are horrible. I got my dog an inflatable one that barely takes up any space,  but kept her from being able to turn her head enough to get to her rear. Worked like a charm, no messes or issues eating or drinking with it on, and she could play like normal.
Wow the room looks incredible! Definitely a peaceful room to heal in. Thank you for sharing your feeling Eamon, we all wonder how it’s affecting you as well. Bec, you are so strong and beautiful! Your smile and positivity are truly incredible. Sending you love from High River, AB.
So glad Bec is doing well🌹
If you had some bitter apple and you could put it on the surgery area when he licked the area he wouldn’t like the bitter taste.🌹
💕
Well done and super congratulations to you both - you rock🎉🎉 - God bless ❤️❤️
Eamon it's good to express your emotions
Eamon, most of the time it is harder on the ones that love her. Just remember you need someone to be your rock as well. She is sick now only to get better. The love you have for one another will get you through. Reach out to friends. Stay strong and perhaps some counseling would help.
I know she can fight it! She will be able to fight!!
Good man Emon
That room would make such a nice lounge with the view and some art and squishy sofas.
The praying for bed and you.God be with you both
Be strong and believe in God
Just subscribe to your channel… accidentally i was searching for  what is life in Mexico vlog. And found yours and now looking for your other videos, and seeing you guys living the life vlog.. so much inspiration. May God bless you both and May God heal beck sooner. Love you guys. From philippines with love.
Thanks for sharing how you're feeling Eamon. It's really empowering to see you vulnerable especially as another guy who struggles with opening up.
Must be nice to know the only makeup needed to look beautiful is a smile....  Stay strong Bec, praying for you.
Hugs for all of you! Chemo is hard work, just hold her hand, feed her, and love her. It will be worth it, my husband is twenty years cancer free and we live a great life.
The biggest hug’s to you both and good vibes
I have a "bear" too. Lol i have no idea how many people comment about him looking like a bear. One guy was like "omg. I thought there was a bear there." 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤣🤣🤣 yup. The apartment complex now allows bears. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The dog jumping up on the couch was brilliant. Love it when doggos think something is a game and don't listen to  a word you say.
The story of Oso and his couch
Poor Oso please don’t take my cama! Lol
Keep yourself busy and always pray . You are strong. Get well soon To be beck.

When you bought it I thought you guys where crazy. Never seen so much potencial for this cabin. Now it looks amazing. God gives you long life together so you can enjoy it. Beck keep fighting everything is going to be ok.
How is Bec?
Cute
Hi guys Its awesome to see you guys back. Hope your doing well, keep your spirits up.  ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
❤️
Sending lots of good vibes to you both from Arnprior Ontario - love love Oso what a great comic relief! :)
Did you guys adopt Oso? Or are u still fostering? He looks soooo happy
Which you the best guys much love from Algeria
Hey you guys how are you doing
Eamon. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability. Bec, always lovely with a spark, even in illness. You both are inspirational.   Used your AG1 promo. I can’t wait to try. I live in Welland which is within the Niagara Region. Was happy to support fellow Canadian and try out AG.   Found you guys initially through Sailing La Vagabonde and then most recently via Dylan and Delia. My YouYube world is becoming more closely connected.   I gravitated to you guys more closely as of late due to my own journey through BC.   ❤️❤️❤️
Great space for yoga! Enjoy my relaxing music while you and Bec meditate in the new room! ✨😊❤️🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏻‍♂️
Want to know how everyone is doing
I know it is tough to record and post but it is 2 weeks later and I miss you, Bec, and Bear. I know the content would be sad or upsetting. But at least it would be something. I personally would love to know your life with c*n**r. Loved seeing how you [Eamon] helped your wife.  As a husband myself, want to share with you something that I am going through, not c*n**r related but life related. And know that even tho we are on the same coast, we only have YouTube to communicate. But know that I am here to talk and keep you motivated [as a spectator].
Prayers and love to bec, and keep being the loving supportive hubbie u r!!!!!!
Hi Bec and Eamon, hope you are both doing okay. Think of you often and pray for you both to have love and healing on your journey...xx
I pray that everything is going well.  Just wanted you to know that we are thinking about you, and praying for you and family.
The fine art of recuperation is seriously undervalued in western culture.  I'm so glad you're taking time and breaks as needed, and allowing yourselves to feel what's coming up.
Bec you remain in my prayers for complete healing.  And Emon you too are in my prayers for strength to remain her rock 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Puppy was like "that's my couch bro"
Keeping you guys in our hearts and prayers ♥️ Sending hugs and positive vibes.
Omg Eamon  you did amazing .... yall take the most average projects and make them shine ✨️.... it's so amazing to see how strong you are Becc .... I truly believe that yall will come out the other side of all this stronger all the love and positive energy ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
God Bless you sweetie. I have not followed you guys for sometime and just ran across you again. Bec, I remember  you were an awesome cook and you guys were so fun to watch, so I am back. May God continue to  BLESS YOU and KEEP THE FAITH.  Jeff------North Carolina
I love you both so much and am sending so much light, but I just gotta say, are all canadians as nice as you guys and your friends? Are you taking expats from america lmao

Where are you guys!! 😭
I am continually amazed  by you both, and my investment in you as people and the video glimpses in your life and adventures. You have become an inspirationa and a bright spot in my life. I pray for better days to come and wish  for the universe to shower Bec with strength and healing daily. Having chick pea salad sandwiches, your recipe tonight. Namaste.....
Miss you, guys, sending you lots of love. 💜  I started binge listening to your podcasts two days ago and am loving it. So to anyone else who is longing for an Eamon & Bec fix and isn’t yet aware of the podcast, it’s called ‘Reroot with Eamon and Bec’. I listen to it on Spotify but you’ll find it on other platforms as well.
Just a quick best wishes to you all there ,I've been following your channel & amazing  journeys  through life from when you ventured out in the 1st sprinter ,I've seen the ups and downs over the past few years and just wanted to hope things get better for you , keep up the positive attitude , wishes from UK 💟💛💚💙
Reppin' those San Antonio Spursssss!!!!! Hell yeah Eamon #GoSpursGo - Much love to y'all from Texas!
All the best love you both from me and all of us in Australia 🇦🇺
It's late here in California but wanted to let you know that you're both in my thoughts. I include you *Beautiful Bec* in my prayers...I pray you have good health again soon. Much love and blessings to you. 💙🙏💙
Great job on the sunroom!  Eamon, you are a superhero!  The families have really pulled together!!  And Bec, your smile alone can cure any cancer!!!  And what a great job you have done with Oso.  He is a hoot!
Very cool transformation on the room - I know it took a while but turned out great. The storage for everything is FANTASTIC! Such a good use of space. Glad this will be a beautiful space for Oso (oh, and the two of you as well). All love and big positive thoughts and hugs
thinking of you guys lots. hope you are doing ok and coming through this situation.  ❤
Absolutely beautiful! You guys have done great. Have you considered a second layer of the Perspex glazing on the inside for extra insulation- kinda like double glazing it?
Has anyone ever commented that Bec’s dad looks like Steve Martin 😮
Where are u to we miss u and we pray for you too . one prayer can send a 1000 to flight 2 armoire can send ten thousand to flight we stand with you in prayer we love you too God bless. Let us know when you can we stand in the gap for you .
Praying for you and seeing you back on top of adventure and having loads of fun!
It looks amazing and inspiring to build such a beautiful and functional space! It's so cool how you transform your amazing brainworks through your smooth workmanship Eamon!
I think about you strangers way too often! Hoping you’re both staying strong. Dying to hear an update.
Love and prayers to you both! 🤍🙏👍💯
Your both in my thoughts!!❤ I hope Eamon shaves his hair. That would be so awesome & supportive!
“…I don’t like it…I LLLOOOOVVVEEE IT!!!”    -Bec’s words I say that all the time.  Get well soon, my beautiful friends.
How's Bec doing
Where is the video you talked about bec
I was miraculously healed of arthritus, both hands, feet, elbows, knees. I fasted a day and went to a Healing room. They said I needed forgive someone and they were right I did need to forgive someone. They didn't know me, their prayers were not loud or exciting. But I walked out 20 minutes later completely healed by Jesus. This happens every day world wide but does not make the news unfortunately. So I do know Jesus and He does still heal as He did when He walked the earth. If your okay with it I 'm going to say a prayer for you Bec. If not please just stop here. Lord Jesus I pray for Bec, I speak Your love and healing power to touch her body and dissolve any cancer cells now in Jesus name! I speak to pain, suffering, weakness, any issues that have come from the chemo and pray right now for Your Strength to come into her body and declare complete recovery! I speak Your Shalom over Bec now head to toe, complete wholeness, restoration, Healing, Love, and Peace over her. A ruling and reigning peace that passes all understanding, that makes whole with nothing lacking or missing. Blessing upon you both, I pray His Love touches you and your never the same. xoxo Communion is like taking dehydrated ressurected Jesus and letting Him wake up inside you!
I pray for her everyday and u 🙏
Aww my goodness how cute Osso not wanting his couch to go. Chemo is so tough i saw my Dad go through it, Bec is doing amazing my Dad was old he just could not take it so they did radiation, Important thing of all is to make sure she eats or gets nutrition. Much love to you all, you will overcome and hopefully it will be just a bad memory xx
Love you two, but living in the remote location you do I kind of shocked your snipped Oso as he isn't really in proximity to other dogs often enough for it to be a concern. It makes sense when living in the city but I think it was a mistake as he won't ever quite be the same pup again.
Buried in 5,424 comments. Missing you guys, got an update?
We love & praying for all of you guys!!!!!!  XOXO
Great job on that room, is that foam environmentally friendly?, no offgas?  Pine looks Great. Osso did not like Losing his couch, sad, you might have consulted him first. Why not include some passive solar design? or heat convection flooring? Was so surprised to see Bec working after chemo.  It was nice to see a different side of Eamon. Check out Hulda Clarks book on parasites .
I think of the both of you often. I hope all is okay.
Hope you are both ok. Sending positive vibes.❤️❤️❤️
Your Dog cracked me up! I needed that laugh, as for I'm with you Bec fighting stage 4 lung cancer with brain mets. I love you guys. Sending strength and healing vibes your way! Hugs too!!
Checking in to say hello and send hugs to Eamon and Bec!
❤❤
I'm thinking about you guys.  Sending love and hugs
How is Bec? How are things with you??? I wish you all the best ❤️
Saw someone at the airport drinking athletic greens ! Kept talking and they also learned of this from watching eamon and bec . Fans around the world  guys we love you
love and prayers always
Ah God bless you both…I laughed my ass off with the dog not staying off the couch lol
Much love. You’ll get through this.
What a grat job on your back room! Loved watching Bec up and helping out!
Good Job guys 👏🏼 we love y'all ❤ Sending Good Vibes your way 🙏 See You Sunday 🌎
Opening scenes...I LOVE THAT DOG... Classic!!!

Hope you guys post soon and things are going as good as possible.  Praying daily for Bec.
Thank you for the update! It was so good to see you both. Continued hope for good days, fast and complete renewal of health and smooth sailing along the way!
You both make my heart happy!  It was good to see your face, Bec, and your bald head. You look so good I would be tempted to go bald forever! Eamon you did such a great job on the room. I LOVE lofts so that was my favorite! God Bless you both❤❤
two week check in . think of you both often. hope the "cabin" is giving you a place of comfort and relaxation. spring will be here soon and new beginnings. cheers from BC
Personal Note… God gave us emotions for a reason. Please Feel… There is a time for everything. Remember, even Jesus wept. I pray for peace of mind for you both. 🙏
Question… shouldn’t the spacing between the metal poles be closer together so a “head” cannot fit through???  Just asking.
Stay strong amigo. Becks is totally amazing.
DEAR EAMON AND BEC I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU ARE BOTH ON MY HEART ❤  TODAY I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY HAPPY. 🐣.  GOD BLESS AND HEAL YOU BOTH AND GIVE YOU STRENGTH. I ❤  YOU BOTH
I Love the dog and of course you guys. I'm going through some cancer problems of my own at the moment but things are looking positive so that's good. Sending you both lots of love and inspirational thoughts. Stay strong. xxx
thank you for sharing your journeys with us...for those of us who will never experience what you two have....wishes beck all the best on her journey i hope you are feeling better.
You guys always deliver love the new work out room 😍
💛💛💛
God is with you  both.   bless both of you
I was very happy to find this post today.  I've been binging on your Vlogs, so was anxious to hear/see how your are doing, Bec.  And, Eamon, my thoughts and prayers are with you as well.  It's very difficult to watch a loved one suffer - it does take a toll on those of us trying to give care to someone so sick.  Bec, you look wonderful.  I'm sure you don't feel that wonderful much of the time, but you are looking fantastic.  Continue your meditation, exercise some when you can, and try to feed your body with good food.  Continued prayers are with all of you.  Much love from Oklahoma.
Love ❤️ to see Bec 😃 smile!! Oso and the couch 🛋 🤣 lol!!!
Sending you both loads of love and best wishes from North Wales, UK. Love all your videos whether they’re van life or cabin renovations! What you’re both going through now must be so hard, and I have so much admiration for you both. You’re both amazing 🤩 xx
Sending big hugs of support to you both.  You are both warriors.
These guys are living my dream life
Subd to ag1, thanks to bobs comments,finally decided to give it a go

Sending you both all the love <3
Nice job!! Beck keep strong, God bless you
Love you guys
Glad your back , been worried. Hugs to you all! Good healing vibes becks way!
Hi guys, i sent you both a message just a bit ago but I wanted to try to send a bit more info about myself to you and talk more about how important  your blogs have become to me. I had mentioned to you that I live in Vancouver.  I am a goldsmith and custom design jeweller, I am a certified geologist and am GIA certified. I have run my own design studio for 27 years. A long while back I was diagnosed with an incurable acanthamoeba. It is a rare disease not often found  in American/North America. There have only ever had 9 cases reported in Canada and the US combined and I am currently the only survivor known of at this time.  I want you to know I work very hard at staying present and proactive in my disease and a big part of my lifting of my spirits and my soul comes from you both.  Over the past few years I have used you ģuys to lift my soul thru the very diffcult times  .If there  is anything I can do to help  you guys, I am truĺy wanting to be there in any way that I can to help both of you in any Way possible. I know this sounds crazy but I  feel a kindred spirit with you both. BEC, YOU ARE A WARRIOR WOMAN WITH A HEART OF GOLD (YOU'VE GOT THIS DOLL). I  Don't know about you but sometimes I feel very afraid...scared really. I want you to know your feelings are valid but it is in these moments I  reach down to the deepest part of my self, take hold of the strongest part of my soul for the freedom of the pain. I love you both dearly as though we have been friends for a lifetime.   Thank you both for being their for me on some of my hardest days.  Continue you loving one another and being their for each other in the scary moments and know that you do help so many people  (HUGELY) myself included and I  just wanted to say thank you to you both. LOVE you both. Carol-Ann Lee
Hugs. You two are amazing and in my thoughts ... thank you for sharing your hearts. 💕 ♥️
I appreciate you sitting down and talking about your feelings and how you’re doing. I think a lot of us who watch a loved one go through a difficult time find ourselves confronted with our own insecurities. Not being able to control the situation is really scary on so many levels. But recognizing that fear and allowing yourself to acknowledge it can be cathartic in itself. Thanks for being vulnerable with us and sharing something I’m sure so many of us can relate to.
Your both such a inspiration & I thank you for everything you share with us with your personal life . My heart goes out to both of you . Of course a lot of us have had to experience hwhat you are going through & as of who have had to go through something like this on either side being “Emon or Bec all know what this is like Bec you look awesome girl !!!! & Emon you are the best man a woman could be with to go thru something Ike this with . 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰
My heart breaks for you guys. Stay strong and have faith. You two have all my prayers for peace and health and prosperity ❤ I am so glad you have your beautiful cozy home to keep you safe and warm as you go threw these trials of life❤

you both are SO strong! it's very impressive. i absolutely LOVE what you did out of this room, it's so modern and cool. have fun
It looks so good!!!!
Big fan here from nova scotia. I've watched for last year or so. Can't wait for every Sunday. Sorry your going through this Bec. 17 year survivor here, you got this. I was 40, had a total mastectomy of lt breast, 9 rounds of chemo and reconstruction surgery x 2. I was very active at first with the dragon boat team which helped me alot. .my heart goes out to you guys. Positive vibes sent your way. Keep up the great work. We all love you.
Could we have an update please?     Just a wave?    We are sending Light and love.💕❤️🌸
He probably loved his couch so much
God Speed Bec 🙏 🙌 ✨️
The work out room looks great🤗.  Prayers🙏🙏for both of you to continue to be strong & for Bec to have quick healing.
The best crunchy asmr 😍
Is anyone gonna ask the question that I’m sure is on a bunch of people’s minds? Have you considered that seed and vegetable oils could be bad for your health?
Sending love from BC <3
Sending hugs and positivity your way everyday but please be patient w yourselves and don’t feel like you just need to “push through”. Sometimes with my health struggles I don’t pay enough attention to taking time to feel however you need to feel.  So please do that for yourselves *hugs*
Beck, you look absolutely BEAUTIFUL with no hair…I’ve been shaving my head for 20 plus years and I think you look great.  Positive vibes and prayers being sent your way. I doubt you will read this but I’m praying for you. God bless, and take it one day at a time…
I thought bec was putting out a vid “ in the next couple days” ….. 10 days later,nothing
God your an incredible couple. Been watching you for years and I love you both so much, weird typing it out but I do. I get so excited seeing a new video and I relax so much watching them. Your home is absolutely beautiful and you've worked so hard on it.   Bec sending so much love and healing to you and Eamon so much love and support for being vulnerable with us. We know you are strong but its ok to not be.  So glad you have each other.   So much love! Xxxx
It's so great to see that Bec is still staying positive and strong and doing her absolute best through everything, both of you really. You guys always talk about Lee how she was such an amazing positive light in people's lives. I don't think that you realize that you two are exactly the same way. You've brought so much positivity and light into so many people's lives through your videos. I know personally watching one of your videos always changed my perspective on my own current situations even before the cancer just the way you guys get out there everyday and do what you need to do and what you want to do with a smile on your face and you have fun doing it. You're both such an inspiration to all of us and bring so much light and joy into our lives that you don't even realize. I'm so proud of Bec for taking the time she needs to rest and heal through this whole process. I know it has to be hard for her to sit out some of this stuff that she loves doing. So many prayers for you both.
Bon courage. You guys rock. Breathe, breathe, keep in the moment. You are amazing.
Sending you all smiles and giggles! I love Osso's delight in the moving couch. Great transformation.
positive vibes for you both, as you go through this hurdle. I completely understand what Eamon is going through, as I am also, going something similar w/ my Mom, who is battling   Pancreatic Cancer. I as Eamon also, have been keeping busy with home projects to keep my mind from wondering into the dark places. My prayers are with you Bec, keep on fighting this horrible Cancer! xoxo to both 💞
Always thinking of you both❤ always praying for you guys as well! Especially Bec❤❤
🙏✝️🙌🤗
Thank you for uploading guys! So proud of you both. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE tell me what song it is that Eamon was dancing to in the sunroom with his brother?? It’s driving me crazy😂 it’s at 23:37
We can only send our prayers for you guys. But one thing i could do is to just watch your videos does not matter what you post (ps: they always post awesome content), to help you guys grow more and more. Lots of love on your way #supporteamon&bec 😘😘
It is SOOOO good to see you guys. I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say that I miss seeing you guys in the regular but I am so happy and proud that you guys are taking the time you need to heal and spend time with each other. Eamon, as always, setting the example for spouses everywhere. 💜 Bec, stay strong sweet girl! Your sunshine radiates even on the darkest days! 🌞
🙏🙏🙏
You beautiful people. Had to check in and hoping you are on the road to recovery Bec. What a great pal to have a nurse man! You both rock!
I am a little late to this. Wanted to say two things: 1.) Bec you are absolutely amazing. 2.) Eamon, keep it up. Amazing. Thoughts and prayers for both of you.
Emotions aside (everyone has said everything), the cinematography and editing on this might be the best one you have done, it felt like a movie, super creative camera work, well done!
Sending you lots of love from Nigeria 💓❤💕💖💗💙💚💛🧡💞💝🖤💜❣️💌
I've been watching since the very beginning and this is your best video yet. I laughed and cried and also feel like I can now build a house with my own 2 hands lol Eamon makes it look so simple. Get well soon Bec xx
You are both AMAZING. Keep going, stay strong, we are sending you all the love and courage possible. GO YOU!!!!!! <3
All them vegs why so sick? Eat some meat
Such a top guy Eamon 👍🏻 And what a great project! Gives me confidence for some more of my own DIY projects! Although much more low-key 😅 Sending love to you both 😊
You both are in my thoughts everyday!!!  Stay strong and know you’ll be on the other side!!  🙏🙏
Love the worrier energy and space!! Bec you are so beautiful! Sending loads of love and strength to both of you lovelies!!! Art will heal your heart!!
LOVE you two SOOOOOOO MUCH😍💗💞 xoxo! Osso is so adorable, he deserves its own couch😍.  Get  well soon beautiful Bec, you're amazingly strong, couargeos and inspirational! You got this Bec💪💯. Eamon you're amazingly strong and supportive, you ROCK!!!  Sending our love to you both❤❤
My name is Carol-Ann and I live in Vancouver.  I was diagnosed with a terminal illness 5 years ago. You both inspire me and I am sending you all of my love and prayers to you and your love ones. Happy healing.
It was great, Bec, to meet your parents! You and your mother have the same warm smile. 🔥🙏🏾🙏🏻🙏🏾❤️🔥
I LOVE IT!! It looks amazing you guys did an awesome job!!
Good to see you guys ❤️
Just got done smiling for 34 minutes and 19 seconds. Thank you Bec & Eamon.
go to 29:00 or so and you will understand this so called cancer if it even is cancer. not estrogen dominant breast boil from eating too much crispy tofu. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eksh9QE6zUg
Room looks Amazing! So good to see the both of you. Much love from the PNW
Just curious as to whether or not you guys will be going over what subtype of breast cancer it is that Bec has? And if, now that she's had some time to reflect, she feels like she had any subtle warning signs that she may have missed.
❤️❤️❤️
This room looks amazing! I'm jealous! What a great view to work out in front of
💙💙
God bless u 2
Eamon you are a lovely man, love your character, you've grown as a person. Thank goodness that Bec has you!

Love You Bec hope every thing is going well! Getting a big kick out Oso and the couch!
Hello friends, we are very happy to find your channel. We always watch and enjoy your videos. Our wish is to one day be like you and be able to travel around the world with it and have a beautiful cottage.💚💙 LOVE FROM IRAN❤
I've been stressing for you guys about the permits! 😬 Any updates?? They're nicer in Canada than the states, so hopefully that includes permit enforcement! Wishing you both good health! ❤
oso is precious. that is all.
🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
AG1 is amazing...been taking it for a year.  If anyone wonders:)

Positive energy to both of you from Maine!

Love is the strongest medicine. We love you Eamon and Bec, most excellent craftsmanship !!
I have watched your channel for years now, you guys really inspire me. I’m praying for you bec❤️
a great ideea
Oh my goodness, that dog and the couch was hilarious. Great content and thx for the video. Bec you look amazing.
My husband got very busy during my breast cancer journey. I would always check in on him as well because he is also going through it in a indirect way.  You are allowed to have your breakdowns as well.  ❤️🙏🏼
How are you guys doing love you guys can't wait for another video
I don't like you guys, I LOVE YOU!!!! Can't wait to see your kids up in that loft. ❤️
What a awesome transformation!! 👊 Eamon! Your talents are impressive! Bec so happy to see you! Glad you are getting some good days! But Oso bud I’m so sorry about your couch!!! That was priceless footage 🤣
Really liked the camera in the dog bowl! Hope Bec gets better fast. Room looks great 👍🏻
Continued blessings for Bec!  Loved the Osso content!  Hugs to you, too, Eamon - you are so real and full of love!
Your place looks so beautiful. You both have worked so hard and you have been blessed with your gorgeous home and land. Wishing you both a happy and wonderful life together. Our prayers are with you both to stay strong 💪🏼 and hope Bec will get well soon.. God bless!
Oso really loves that couch 😂😂😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Much Love and respect to both of you  for staying so strong on your journey! 💜🙏🏼✌🏼
I can tell how much oso cares for Eamon, so glad he’s got his little cheery, furry friend to keep him going during this time❤️
Omg Oso jumping on the couch over and over was hilarious :)) Sending y'all love ❤ Also the porch turned out soooo good!!
I need an Eamon playlist, your music is so fire 🙌🏼🔥
Keep checking on the channel to see if there are any updates on how Bec is doing.  Keeping her in my prayers.
You guys are amazing. I'm navigating  through your travel videos( Kara and Nate are another YouTube channel favorite and that's how I discovered  your awesome  channel). And as much as I enjoy your travel videos (who wouldn't?!) I look forward to these updates into your life. It seems strange to be so invested in strangers on the internet, but you guys just inspire that kind of following/love.  Pourch/gym looks great! Thank you so much for sharing your lives with us! Bec's energy  in this video is fire! Much love from Saskatchewan ❤️
Great job! The room looks amazing! Sending nothing but positive vibes your way!
It’s tough, Eamon, when you are a fixer and a doer - when you can’t fix something with effort and action.  You’ve focussed your effort and action on your beautiful wife and projects for the two of you.  Well done my man.  And it’s ok to have feelings of your own. Gripes, complaints and frustrations are totally normal.  I wish you both well on this journey… you’ve got this!
You owe us nothing, but we really appreciate what you do. Thank you.
Have been thinking of you and how you guys are. Awesome work Eamon. So glad to see you are doing well Bec. You are both so strong. Sending love your way.
Had to watch this again. Oso is fun..right up your alley. Hey I made your chickpea salad for the first time. No wonder you eat it all the time. Thank you! Think of both of you during our off times. Thanks for keeping us informed.
The dog was so cute on the couch, made me smile. Now I’m drowning in tears over Bec 🥲 the vlogs just aren’t the same without her presence as much.. I hope she’s feeling okay.. and Eamon, I know it must be so so difficult to see your loved one endure this. Keep your heads up, sending prayers. ♥️♥️
All the love to you från Åland island, i hope you both are ok.  huge hug to you both. i haf a surgery for breastcancer in 1993, i had two suregeries, and after that i have been cancerfree. i pray for you, and your health.❤️
Sending you wagons of love to both of you.
The colourings are beautiful I’d really recommend the books by Johanna Basford my favourite is enchanted forest and lost ocean there really great and so beautiful 🥰
Thinking of you
Hi! The room looks Amazing!!! Thank you Eamon for sharing this journey you are on! Praying for you and Bec! ❤️
Go Spurs Go!!
What happened with the town/permits for your stairs to the lake? Fingers crossed you don’t have to change anything!
Amazing update... keep strong and sending lots of blessings to you both 💖🙏
Bec is so beautiful even when she is bald... Love you guys and I wish you good luck in the future!
Wow I so enjoyed this. Also a shout out to Eamon on the heart sharing, and great to see Bec dancing and smiling. Love you two.
Your dog too precious
❤
What true love really is. ❤  Sending love and prayers  to both of you.
Your a great guy!
Oso is the funniest doggo👌🏼🤣
Love you guys soooo much and I’m endlessly praying for you both ❤️
Loved osso in the beginning ❤. Eamon when you talked about bec I cried. She's so lucky to have such a supportive partner. BEC your smile is so contagious ☺  & you look absolutely beautiful 😍
Get out!! You did not spend THAT much money for that tiny reno. It’s the exact same with new flooring and paint. Your content has been seriously lacking (for obvious reasons) why not take a year off of social media to heal and become creative again.
You continue doing what your doing. There's not much we can do but keep busy n stand by their side. It's just that late nights when it's just you n your thoughts. It'll get better Eamon.
How do I find the description to get the AG code/discount to order?
He a good dog and a few trick on his tail  how too sit on a moving setters
Osso is definitely an icon! Supporting both of you! Eamon, you’re so kind and build amazing things! Bec, you’re incredibly strong and everyone so proud of your positivity through life! All of you are incredible and make me smile every Sunday! ❤️❤️
God bless family great team work yall my prayer going strong for yall beauatiful life  wife
❤️❤️❤️
Yall are awesome stay strong bec
This channel is another level of candor, love and positivity. It is immensely heartwarming 🥰 Thank u
What breed is your dog?
Seeing Bec smiling makes me smile.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
You gave the baby couch away 😂
The best video I‘ve watched in the past weeks. The cutting is sooo good! And I just love how we get to watch the transformation of the cabin, the cute big Osso and I appreciate it so much, that you let us see a part of your life with cancer. Thank you so much! You‘re making me very happy
I have seen these soft collars, like donuts.  They seem like they might be more comfortable.  Anyway Love to You and Bec!
❤️
the dog for me
Hey Bec...you might like to watch Vintage Bombshell on YouTube. She went through breast cancer some years back and has multiple videos on what she went through. She also has cool vintage jewelry and fashion videos.
I’m so glad Bec you are feeling better, and you look so refreshing❤ Eamon you are a skilled builder with creative ideas! I love that room!
Very very cool! Awesome job on the studio<3
Love you eamon. It’s definitely not easy. Thank you for being so truthful and vulnerable.    All you need to do is focus on one minute at a time and breathe with Bec. It’s all going to be ok. Just a season of life. Y’all have the best to come. I truly believe that.  Keep cuddling bear and it will all be ok. Kisses and love and light to Bec. We all love you both sooooooooo much. Much love from Texas ❤️
Love and support to you bec
Hey Eamon! Always dig your approach to projects it's cool! I myself have an insulation issue myself under my floor! Got some 2 inch sheets of 4'x8' roofing insulation and gonna screw it to the floor! You may check it out or find the dry time to do it the way you planned! Love seeing Bec back even if short time! You guys are awesome!! Much love! Keep it up!
Best wishes to you two.
Now that you have your cool “storm” door installed you will have a big problem opening it the next time you have a snow storm.  You need to protect that opening with some kind of an overhang.
Are you guys keeping Oso long term? He is so cute, perfect addition to the family 💜💜💜💜💜
Hi, I know you’re not traveling right now, but I felt that you should know how much you inspire people to live the life they want to live rather than living a life of societies standard mold. My partner and I are now building out our bus to travel and see the world. We’ve followed you for a while now, and I don’t think we missed an upload since finding you on YouTube. Such amazing people like you deserve the world!!! Thank you for being you! SO much love to you and Bec❤️
This is so so beautiful, what an incredible achievement and the perfect place full of healing vibes for Bec. Sending all the love to you three xx
Love the new renovations.  Hugs to both of you. ❤️❤️
Ok the dog with couch and cone head scenes were hilarious. And what a great looking room! Wish I had that talent!
What an amazing space! The two of you have created such a beautiful home.  Thanks for continually sharing, love and positive energy to you both (and the pup)
Omg the dog and the couch. im dying!!
I feel so bad for Oso!
Fabulous before & AFTER!! Much love & positive vibes ❤️
She will get strength from your strength stay strong bubba. ❤️❤️
My dogs cone was covered with duct tape by the time his week was up 😂😂
Peace and love ☮️💜 to the both of you.
LOL love watching that poor dude chasing down his favorite couch!
Eamon your right to keep your mind clean with projects.  My husband does the same to keep the bad thoughts at bay.  even though we still have our moments we break down, but then need to pick ourselves back up.   Bec so happy to hear your halfway thru.  I'm chronic so I'm going on 3 years now and it's HARD!   But I gotta still keep kicking for my family.  😊
!!!!!OSO!!!!! And, okay, the porch is pretty rad, too 😉😍
Awesome video! God bless. Always remember that Jesus Christ loves you all so much! Jesus Christ forgives all sins. Jesus Christ is God, King, and Savior!❤️🙏
Amazing renovation!  What is your leaderboard names for Peloton!  I would love to ride with you both.
Thank you for sharing how you're feeling Eamon. I can't imagine watching someone you love suffer so much. And your vlog doesn't suck. Bec, you look amazing, I wouldn't guess you were going through chemo if I didn't know. You guys are a wonderful couple. So strong and supportive for each other, it's amazing. Also, the room looks great, love it!
How is Bec feeling since she started the chemo treatments>
Anyone in America should note: this diagnosis would bankrupt many of us. I'm so happy Bec has medical care and support that doesn't cripple her financially. Much love to you both. Glad you live in Canada.
Can we just show some love to the SpongeBob pencil!!! Haha
You are there for her.   You love her and you are caring for her very well.  You are there for her.  Good thoughts and prayers for you guys and your families.
Love ya buddy. Prayers for both of you.
XXOX
I really like how you aren't afraid to build things even if you aren't sure exactly how...FYI the spacing of the loft bars are suppose to be on 4" centers by code..My guess is to keep children from getting their head stuck between and to keep them from falling through the bars...
You two are such a power couple. You guys will get through this. Keep positive and happy thoughts your way and sending prayers. Xo
It will all be better in the long term. Keep your eyes on the prize,  this too will pass, and kids will be next.  Hugs
I love to see you busy again Eamon.  And all the people helping wile Bec is doing chemotherapy. And it is okey to break down once and a while. This means your also looking after yourself. It means your human. It means you care. And that also give us hope to keep on seeing the good old crazy Eamon we all love. You are one big inspiration for us. And most off all to dear Bec. And Bec your are one big inspiration to all of us that are sick or not. This means to me positivity is a big thing to help in bad days. It help a lot.  Prayer going your way from me. Love you guys. O by the way I love the dog. Osso?
love you Oso!  Hugs to you and thank-you for giving us the good and the bad.  Thinking of you.
Glad you’re both doing alright and seem in high spirits. A positive attitude matters more than you would think.   I still recommend reading ‘You Are the Placebo’ by Joe Dispenza. It completely changed my outlook on life and coping with chronic pain and illness.   I hope you are having more sunny days! Get out and breathe that air.   Eamon, the vlog is good. You’re doing just fine man. You both got this.
looks fanastics i hope everthing is ok with Bec
That dog very like me very dope.
get a pool noodle and put it around his neck instead of the cone. will not be able to reach his incision. for Oso
Love from kerala india 💕
Holy smokes Eamon you’re a professional carpenter😍 And Bec so happy to see you in the vlog ☺️ Sending love to both of you ♥️ Thank you for uploading another amazing video
❤️❤️❤️
we love you guys so much !!  we re heartbroken that beautiful woman inside and out is having to go thru this.  My prayers are with uou guys!!!!!
You guys are awesome! Sending you all love and sunshine from Florida ❤
Lots of love and prayers for both of you.
Stay strong you guys! You got this! Miss your faces
Oso is adorable! He very clearly communicated his strong objections to the removal of the 🛋. It’s his 🛋 humans!!
💛✨ you two are such amazing people!!!! Sending good vibes & love! One day at a time.
I’m sending you all of the positive healing energy and I’ve been thinking of you two! 💛🌞✨
Sending much love and hugs! Great video! The porch looks amazing!
Thank you for sharing in this beautiful vlog.
2 weeks? Wow when my dog got neutered he only had to wear it 2 days maybe cause he was only 7 months? Who knows but that seems long
Cause we love you and this is so challenging with lots of emotion - when you get your heart yanked out of your body and feels like somebody tried to make scrambled eggs with your brain. So we can be some LIGHT✨in your darkness, we can pray and send lots of energy.  It’s awesome to have a project and gives you some since of normal and forward.  You are sharing your life, your love, your sadnesses, and your victories. Life challenges us in ways we do not expect, we have to persevere and make our way as best we can! Lovin me some Oso too! I have four big fur babies, good companions.  Much love sending, sending, sending......Herbalist Kelli in Florida
Oso clearly needs his own couch haha he's adorable - you both are so strong, keep on fighting the fight <3
You two are the kindest and most beautiful people I've ever seen, you don't deserve this. Could it be that life is a bitch or that, on the contrary, it put you on the same path for something. The love you have for each other is beautiful and I think that just as sometimes life takes many things out of you, having each other is the best gift that she could give you. Be strong, You can do it❤️
continued love to you both!
Lots of ❤️ and good vibes your way! You are awesome team and your video as always is 💯 Stay strong, get better soon. Hugs
Oso on the couch was so cute.
I love the way your dog wants to be part of everything, guess it's an age thing, mine is in his twilight and does his own thing. Fabulous space you have created, you should be very proud.
Now I know why Kara and Nate didn't show up!! Too much work :)  Thanks for sharing your journey -- the best is yet to come!
Beck!! You rock baby!! Keep up the good mood and optimism!! I just love strong women like you!! We got your six by praying for your recovery!! You got this!!  Strong kick ass women always win!! Ramon!! You truly are a man to be proud of!!  Love you guys!!
Bec looks really good
I absolutely adore you both.  Bec is truly amazing and brave.  Thank you Eamon for allowing yourself to be vulnerable and sharing your struggles. I have been watching your videos for quite a while.  Being vulnerable and sincere is what makes you so strong as a couple. Sending positive energy your way for healing. Your workout zen coloring space is beautiful.
Oso won the Internet today!
Eamon, you did such a good job on the room. It looks awesome!! I wish nothing but the best for you both. I'm constantly praying for both you and Bec, and I'm confident that you've got this. Life sucks, but if we didn't have obstacles like this along the way, we would not know the true meaning of life. Sending you both lots of love all the way from Edmonton, Alberta.  ❤
So good to see y’all! I kept checking- I understand! Take care and praying this is over soon!
We love you guys
Eamon the porch makeover looks wonderful. Osso was not happy about his couch being moved. He was hilarious.  It is so important that you take care of your mental health while you are supporting Bec through her journey. You are both in my prayers and I'm sending you both lots of love and positive vibes.#uwillgetthroughthis
Saludos y muchas fuerzas desde Cordoba? Argentina! Abrazo inmenso!
We love you Eamon. Keep God first he'll see you through this journey. God bless you both.
Bec how beautiful you are. You shine through, inside and out!!!
We are praying for everyone  , all you can do is keep 🙏and God  bless you for standing by her good luck and have fun each day with each other
Remember always, LIFE SAVING DRUGS. Drugs can be ok if it means she is wilth you. The other day I went to my doctor. He said if I had not caught my cancer, I would be gone now. Remember to appreciate every day together and fuck the little things. Remember the big picture, always!
Eamon I always thought you were awesome but your actions and support of Bec elevates you to another level. I went through this at 40 in 2005 with support from my partner and kids. You guys make me cry and be happy at the same time. Sending all my energy to you both!!!!
Hey guys, following your journey here and wish you guys the best. I'm a former 6 year vegan, my fiance 12. We came to realize that the diet was creating illness within ourselves. We switched to a mostly meat based diet. Mostly fatty* meat as well. I don't want to tell you guys what to do, or how to live your lives, as I know you guys have your identities. However, I highly recommend researching meat based diets from Dr. Anthony Chafee, and Shawn Baker. At least take a look and see if it's something you guys would want to do. There's a lot of (sadly) propaganda with veganism, as corporations are trying to get you to be paying customers, alongside big pharma. I'm saddened to see what you guys are going through, and I wish you guys nothing but the best. Sincerely.
Are you keeping Oso? He’s so cute and has such a cool personality. Glad to see Beck doing well.
Love seeing you guys on the Tube again.  Cancer can be just as hard on the caregivers.  Eamon so glad you can share some of your journey as well.  As a 3 time cancer survivor I can relate a lot to Bec's journey and you journey.  It can be even more difficult when your care giver can not go with you to treatments.  So glad Bec has a great time taking care of her when you (Eamon) can't be in the treatment room.  Been thinking about you both a lot as I have been though chemo twice for breast cancer and we just finished our Baja trip where we had memories of your vlogs in Baja also. Sending all the healing vibes to you both.💕
Keep the faith you two!! I am praying for strength and healing!!
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, amazing amazing amazing.. inspiring inspiring inspiring... and I'm joining in to send all my love your way... I love seeing your cabin be healed, along with Bec's cancer...!
Love you guys!Theentry/workout area looks AMAING!!
Awww Bec you look amazing and Eamon, you are super man. Your such a loving guy and your creativeness for the sunroom is so amazing!!!!!  Man! You truly have an awesome vision.
GWS Bec, healthy wishes all the way from Bahrain 🇧🇭.
I've been thinking of you both. Eamon being a loved one's caregiver is taxing, and you are being normal and doing awesome. Take care of yourself, that is important. This was a great project and video. Love your music selections!
PIVOT... I thought you two might be too young for the reference... love it that you spliced it in!
Get oso a soft cone. He’ll still mess around but at least you won’t have to keep replacing the broken ones.
Hi Eamon & Bec, it's been a wee while since I've had the chance and pleasure to catch up with you both, you wonderful and beautiful souls. I'm broken hearted to hear of the challenges that you have both faced since I last saw you, and that you are both still facing..... and at the same time, I'm ssoooo proud of the love, mischief and tenderness that you both share throughout these times with each other (and indeed share with us, your friends from afar). To see you both embrace each other physically and emotionally through these times is a blessing, thank you. I send you all my love, the biggest of hugs, and my bestest of bestest wishes all the way from Bonnie Scotland. We're all here from around the world, in our droves, supporting you. MMMMWWWAAAHHHH!!! 😍🥰😘, David (from Scotland) XXXX

For Athletic greens if I can’t live without my coffee in the morning… can I still use it in the morning ?
Love this!!
Gheezz I am praying for you guys....
Bro the solution to cancer is make the body alkaline..blend citrus with peel n seeds..u can either freeze it or.  put it in fridge n eat a tablespoon everyday..
When did u get oso?did i miss something?
Sending much love and support.. So proud of Bec.. You guys rock. Eamon you are a rock star, Bec is so lucky to have you .  HUGS
Buddy, Bear & Bec 🤩❤️
God damnit just give the dog the couch
Wow what an amazing transformation you did on that room!! So glad to see you are both doing so well with all you are going through. I just love Osso and his obsession he had with the sofa. He stole the show. Know you always have my love and support in everything and anything you may need it for. You two are amazing. Love you guys ❤️
Sooo happy to see this video, for the past 3 days I've been dying to leave you guys a comments asking how you loves are doing, but did not do it because should not give you guys any pressure.  Eamon & Bec, you are both superstars, LOVE YOU GUYS!!  so happy to see you guys doing well.  Your new space is amazing!   Awesome job Eamon.  Enjoy it to the fullest.  Beautiful place.  God and the universe knew exactly the greatest place to call home for you guys.  Your property is magical, spring and summer guys, fun, fun, fun.  Enjoy.  Hugs!
Maybe I missed it, but.. what happened to the building inspector and admissions and the building stop? :)
Bec you look so BEAUTIFUL you ARE so BEAUTIFUL 😍
Great job guys!
some good knees over toes guy training!!! It's been a game changer for me!
🤍💛❤️💜🧡💚💙🖤💗
My throat surgeon put me on a schedule of drinking organic lemon juice(whole lemon juiced) into 4 ozs of room temp distilled water in the morning and again at night before bed.  This will make your body basic in 30 days.  This is what you want to make the cancer cells die.  Cancer cells cannot live in a non-acidic environment.  I did this when I was 27 and now I'm 58 and still cancer free!!!!  Wishing you two the best for the rest of your lives!!!!   Live Well, Love Much, Stay Positive, and Laugh Each and Every Day!!!!  God Bless.
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy It's so good to see you guys!!!!!  Bec, KEEP pushing!! we are all out here praying and thinking good thoughts towards you and for you.. Eamon you are the man for Bec you are her ROCK. We LOVE YOU BOTH. the Gym/ guess room looks amazing.
Ahh thanks for including Bob! Good to see him briefly on the vlog. He always makes me grin. Love to you all
❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️ Sending all the love your way Bec and Eamon

Next time get Oso an inflatable donut collar. Keeps them from reaching their incisions and acts like a travel pillow.
❤❤❤❤ to all
This video was fabulous. Besides the awesome reno, it was hilarious (with a small, wonderful intermission for Eamon’s heartfelt message). Thank you so much for continuing to take us along with you. Much love and support from Scarborough, Ontario.

Fantastic job on that space. It looks amazing. I am in the process of transforming what used to be my dads shop and is now a much smaller area of shop with a huge empty space on one side into a workout studio. It’s nowhere near as fancy as your but you definitely have me some great ideas.
Get well soon 🙏 by gracelyn

Eamon, thank you for your update. It really is a battle that BOTH of you are facing and I think that you are both handling it so wonderfully. She is being so strong just being able to realize when to slow down is really hard sometimes and I'm glad to see she is getting the hang of things. And you are being so supportive and great at being serious when she needs it and making jokes and keeping it light the rest of the time.   We are all here for you. If you need anything. Call upon us anytime.
My dad has cancer at the moment. We understand how your feeling.. Stay strong!

Hi ! I'm french,  so sorry if my english is not very good😊! Just a little message from France for love and support ! You are so strong and inspiring for me... For home, lifestyle, state of mind during this test, and especially as a couple and your humanity. So thank you two !!! After the rain, always come the good weather ! Thank you for Just being you and sharing it 😊! ❤
A great video, the transformation of the porch looks fantastic. Great choice of finishes. I enjoy how you two get along and can laugh even when things are not as easy as you want. Good thoughts and prayers for you. Thanks for sharing.
I hope you’re feeling better Bec
Eamon, you are amazing .. keep strong 💪 buddy!
Permits..... That's all I'm Staying 😁
I have been thinking ... where is the lady of the house? So happy to hear she is doing amazing! Keeping you in my prayers 🙏
🙏🏼 Thank you for sharing your journey!😍
Bec you got this, you are strong enough to make it though and fight it out.
Time for you two good people to come back to the LORD, HE loves you two and HIS family wants to welcome you two with open arms,  GOD is love.
Brave sharing Eamon love you well done x
Love your groove 🎶🎵❣️🐕❣️ Keeping you in prayers 🙏🏽💛❤️💙
Blessings  ....
Breaks my heart to hear to watch part of what you're going through.  Having dealt like situations such as yours I can say one thing from experience.  Eamon take care of yourself even if it means speaking with a cancer support group.  It helps TONS and a healthy (mental and physical) caretaker is important.  The other thing is to allow yourself to break down and go to the dark place, but learn the techniques to bring it back and you'll do just fine.  Sending lots of love to the north!
Thinking and praying for both of you.  I have been watching you since the beginning and feel like you all are good friends (although we have never met). Thank you for the positive, loving, vegan content. You all are amazing....sending all my love and GOOD VIBES!
Hugs Eamon! It's so hard! When it's someone you ❤ love cancer sucks! And praying for Bec ! Sending love to you two! And big hugs! You guys did a great job on your porch!💕
Oso's loyalty to that couch is unmatched. Lol
I'm trying to buy Athletic Greens and give your promo code so you get credited, but it's not working.  What is the promo code to use?
Thoughts and prayers to you both.  Keep your heads up.  Love you both.
You are so talented! Amazing work you did.
Bloody Amazing Eamon 💙
🙏 So good to see you both! I have been thinking and praying lots! Sending positivity your way!
Very hard time l felt that before you said it 😭, but God love Bec she is so positive, it’s very tuff going through chemo , and you can see you feel that for Bec . Sending you both love from Dublin 💙💙
The place looks wonderful, Eamon & you are nothing but amazing, Bec! Much Love & Peace to the three of you! 🐕👳‍♀️👳‍♂️
😍 love stay positive x
I am not a dog person so I promise this is high praise: your dog is hilarious and adorable and I would love to have a dog like that. What a lovely goofball!!
Wow!
Bossing it as always! Inspirational. Love 💚💚✨✨🌞🌞.
Happy to wait on new videos, and as always, they don't disappoint!  Nice room!    Good to see Bec in good spirits too!
I fucking love Bec. Get it you frozen kween! Sending love from the 416
Thank you for sharing
Praying for you both 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Get well soon Bec. or Eamon will be forced to remodel the rest of the house. Eamon, you should consider yourself blessed, you still have Bec your her Rock.
It’s hard dealing day to day. I’m in a similar situation. Try to maintain normalcy as much as possible helps. Prayers to you and your wife.
Eamon and Bec ...you guys are awesome.   Eamon you are truly a wonderful person. I think it's so wonderful how you are supporting Bec through this difficult time... you are a rock.  Awww Bec you are so beautiful inside and out and I admire your strength through this all.  I want to let you know that I am a cancer survivor....I am cancer free.  I had thyroid and chondro blastic sarcoma on my face.  I understand what you are going through and how difficult it is at times but your attitude is so important and you are an inspiration.  My faith in God, family and friends got me through those rough times.  I am not religious but I believe in God....and when the going got rough....I said my prayers and knew I was not alone.  This too shall pass.  I am so happy to see yours and Eamon's strength.  You are both in my thoughts and prayers.  I know you don't know me but I feel like I know you guys....you have so many people who love you guys....keep your chin up ...you will conquer this.
You guys are amazing
Awesome work you brave and vulnerable people. So good to know that there are honest, hopeful, sorrowing and joyful people like you two.
Love it guuuys! Doing great! Eamon in your situation I think it's totally normal to have fears of losing control. I think it's not an easy position at all. Lots of strength and love to you guys xx
The new room looks great! I’m sure you guys will get lots of use out of that. Great to see Bec having some good energy days! Much love to you both! Stay strong, you’re in our thoughts and prayers.
One day at a time Eamon That’s all you can do.
Definitely just watched this vlog for Oso! Sending positive vibes for you and Bec! 💕🐾🐶
Love the video, love you guys, sending good vibes x
I missed Tim
On the bright side at least the dog can get CNN....
The room looks great!  Many prayers for both of you!  🙏❤️
For Oso you should look into a ‘cushion cone’ they’re basically like a travel pillow that’s made for dogs instead of a plastic cone. They can’t get at any stitches and it’s super comfortable for them! My dog had surgery and hatesss the cone & he loved it, he was able to sleep with it on resting his head on it too & it doesn’t break if you’ve an active dog too! Also as usual all the love and positive vibes to Bec, you’re an absolute inspirational queen 💕💕
Yayy Bec! You’re almost there!! ❤️❤️❤️ Eamon, you’re tough like a nail and cool as a cucumber which I’m sure keeps the vibes positive in any stressful moment. The world needs more people like you!
that poor dog and his couch!
Love, love love when you wear our SA Spurs original colors sweatshirt!!!! Good to see yal back!
Your cabin is literally my house dreams! it looks so good!! i hope everthing else goes well.
You two have been on my mind. I love your love for each other. Sending good vibes and an air hug from Wisconsin. 🤗
Such a beautiful space! Open yet really functional. :) And Bec and family were able to help too. Yay!
You guys are great and it was a good vlog. Oso stole the show! What a sweet and funny baby! 🥰
You guys are so awesome! Sending lots of love and healing!
Eamon it is so very difficult to be a caregiver. And, you are correct that keeping your mind busy is a good thing so it doesn't stray down those unwelcome paths. It's important to take time for you, which I'm hoping doing this project was part of that. You both are doing great!!  Sending love and prayers!
Have you officially adopted Oso? He’s part y’all’s healing.
You've deprived the dog of. . . Ok next subject. Yes. It's all I've been thinking about the entire video.
🍀🙏
🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
You're halfway there wahoo and radiation just make you tired because  my mom had it
Sending you guys lots of love. Stay strong ❤️
Hang in there! Your both doing great!  One day at a time!
Can someone explain to me how Bec looks so stunningly beautiful while bald, going through CHEMO and not feeling well!?!?  If this is her ‘worst’ then I’ve got to step up my game, big time. 😊 Girl is doing something right, I’ve never seen any one so radiant and beautiful while on chemo, inside and out she’s gorgeous.  All my love, thoughts and prayers to you two as you make your way through this journey.  I walked this path with my son when he was 4 years old and diagnosed with a high risk form of childhood cancer.  It has changed me forever.  The caveat is that I’ve learned to see life through a completely different lens.  One that is much more vibrant, deeper and richer.  I learned the true meaning and value of life from a 4 year old who kicked cancers ass.
So is this the same dog you were fostering? And have you decided to keep him cause he looks at home
Hi guys so happy to see you guys
WOW, you are amazing!!! I'm completely lost for words over this transformation Eamon! I can't wait to see glimts of your yoga sessions again Bec  🤗❤️
This is absolutely AWESOME!!!!! Such a great job. Love, love, love!!!!!
Missed you guys…! But totally was surprised to see a vid…..take care!

nice work Eamon, keep up the good work, both on the house and supporting Bec. Ive rooting for you guys' victory. A window in the mini-loft would be awesome, if even a ship-window, What do you think?

Much love to you both ❤️ soon this will all be over and you guys will continue to live your life the same way you used to for many years to come. I prayed for you and I'm sure many other people you touched for the last couple years are doing the same. God smiles on the people that make others smile. May Allah bless you and your family with a long happy beautiful life so you can continue to uplift and put smiles on his people face like you been doing so far. Great blessings come to those that bless others 🙏

Much Love❤keep strong❤thoughts & prayers are w the both of You❤Xo XOXO
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. JOHN 14:6

Bec, you are rocking the new haircut.  I told my wife she has never looked hotter. Glad you are feeling better.  Eamon, as a guy going through the same kinda thing, just stay strong and stay busy.  Be strong. Sending much love.
I love Oso 😍 Used to have dogs of this type, they're such characters. Sending all that good energy to you and Bec 💖
Wow! I love y’all.
You are both so strong! Thank you for sharing this Eamon, I can only imagine how hard it must be to stand in your shoes. It's okay to not be okay too sometimes, and I have mad respect for you guys opening up about all this online. The room looks really cool, and Oso's part in this video was hilarious!(hope he's doing alright now)
Love you Eamon and Bec! stay strong and healthy always! more power to you guys!

I think your dog can have his own show.
hey bec !!!!!!! you guys are amazing!!!! i hope u guys keep OSO!!!!!
I’m always get inspired every time I watch your videos. Thank you for everything you do. We’re always here to support!
Favorite moments:  Eamon rapping talking to Oso, opening up to us, working so hard for the renovations, asking if the inspector has any issues 😅  Beck’s bald head, dancing while Eamon raped, coloring in your book & your mandalas, positivity in general, your smiling face even going through chemotherapy! 🥰  Oso’s cone, him jumping on the couch as it’s leaving without him, him eating with the camera in the bowl, & napping… 🐶  Of course The room at the end!
Amazing work! Looks great. Here's to the whole fam for pitching in.
People love you both. Clean house is a healthy mind. I suffer with anxiety and depression and Emon is doing his best to control what he can and can't. Bec you are are awesome for staying strong and positive. Family definitely helps, even though sometimes we may not want it due to our pride. Xoxo
Awww Eamon you don’t owe us anything, but it’s soooo good to see you opening up! We all need to share our troubles to get them off our chest, & this community is a supportive place to do that, & I hope all you’re getting (or giving your energy is the positive comments. It’s always one of the hardest jobs to care for others when they need us! You’re doing amazing!   Bec you’re such a light in this world & you being tired is 110% understandable! You’re the most positive person & I appreciate your honesty when you’re having a hard day! Life isn’t all sunshine & roses, but you’re going to make it through this stronger! I just know it! Please be easy on yourself & know your body is fighting all the time!   Sending sooo much love & prayers to you from Cali USA! 💞💞💞💞💞🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
When we stumbled upon your channel last year we would have never expected how much of an influence you would be to us, just as you are are to so many people of all walks of life. Your incredibly strong! We send all the love and support from sunny Tampa Fl! 😎👍❤️ -Justin
27:23 Eamon sounds like Taika Waititi 😂 Wish y’all the best❤️
Awww love you guys and great to see this project! Hit the ball out of the park on this one 🥰
It’s an incredible space! Also, you don’t owe us anything. Y’all are already sharing your journey so openly on so many levels. If the feels are personal, there’s no reason whatsoever to be obligated to share. That said, I think you are both so brave as you face this together a unified front! You channeled your energy into a creative and lovely work. Good job! And Oso and his couch cracked me up! 😂
The couch!!! OMG I was rolling!
Love seeing your beautiful smile beck! Damon you crushed this makeover!!
THIS IS AMAAAAAAAZING!!! So good to see another build!
Omg, So funny! The dog did not want to give up the couch.
love you guys xx
Osso is such a good and funny dog praying for you guys
Beautiful !
Eamon, my wife went thru breast cancer in ‘09. It was the worse thing to watch your loved one go thru. She had a mastectomy followed by 8 weeks of chemo then 4 weeks of radiation. Everyday after chemo I had to bring her back for the hydration she couldn’t hold anything down. Next was the reconstruction which ended going bad and had to be redone a few months later. It is quite the ordeal for her medically and emotionally. For me just emotional, support people or groups that have gone thru it really helped. I stayed strong for her and never let her see if I was emotional so I could show her I was her Rock. Always lean on family friends or other in the same boat who have gone thru it. You will both get thru it especially Bec, she seems like a strong willed person  Good Luck and you got this !!!⚓️🇺🇸❤️
All the renos look amazing. Good job. Prayers have been up for Bec to kick this in the arse! Bec is strong, brave and such a light in a difficult world. Prayers for you to Emmon. I know that yall have built this community, but yall gained loads of family to support yall and love on yall. (I'm from Louisiana.)
You included a lot in your 34-minute video. Friends and family arriving to give you a helping hand, the dog not wanting to let go of the couch, and the absolutely amazing job you did on restoring your porch! Eamon, you revealing to viewers about how you're coping with Bec's health was very moving and inspirational. Perhaps it's not coping as much as it is learning daily how to get through a difficult time. I wish for the both of you continued strength (with the new workout room), and for Bec a return to good health.
Glad to see you reclaim that porch space and make it a beautiful area to workout in and enter your home through. Everything you do to make your life easier will help you on this journey. Be good to yourselves. 💙💙
I came back to watch twice. I saw I accidentally hit ‘dislike’. Glad I caught that. I love it! Miss y’all kids. ☀️💛
Prayers for you both. You are doing great!
I'm so glad you were both feeling well enough to post a video.  Big hugs to you both!

Hey fellow Canadian I have to say those of us that have been where you are we know as a caregiver it is hard, it’s down right hell but dear  sweet Eamon good on you for sharing. All I know to say is I send you so much love. Everyday is another day closer to being done and in no time you will be hitting the road. God bless both of you so good to see Bec happy and feeling energized.♥️🌹♥️🌹
Stay strong Eamon find time to rest too do not push yourself to much.
Hi Eamon and Bec - thank you for your vulnerability and honesty.  This world is better for you both.  May you find peace and solace and wisdom in your suffering. Joy will also follow.  Stay just the way you are, you both are so tuned into the love and light.
Awesome room! And Bec, you go, girl!! Rest, colour, laugh…. Whatever brings you joy, be kind to yourself. I don’t know how I missed it, but how did Osso come to be in your family? He was so sweet fighting to stay with his couch! Sending you all love and strength.
Becs dad seems so genuine and sweet 🥺❤️
Love you guys stay strong. We always get up again when we fall praying for you too your Canadian friend
We Love both of y'all !!!! many prayers send to y'all!!!! Love watching
This vid was just so dang good! All the Osso parts were freaking hilarious, I loved the whole format. And thanks for sharing with us how this has been affecting you. So good to have frinds and family to work with nd hare life with. Good to see Bec having a good day! love snd hugs to you both!
Nothing but positive vibes and prayers for you both!  Btw Eamon nice job the gym dude!
Happy to see you guys! Was worried not to hear from you here! Healing time for you, in many ways! Wish you the best
Oso is stealing the show and I love it
love you guys. just know our thoughts and prayers are with you. <3
Osso is definitely the superstar of this episode😃Great seeing everyone that we haven’t seen in a while….and meeting others for the first time. Sending our thoughts and well wishes your way!
Eamon you can never control cancer. You are doing the best you can. As a mom whose oldest son had bone cancer and survived, I can say Bec will come out of this horrible part in her life and will be herself in no time. Sending you both love.
Eamon…thank you for sharing your vulnerability…I am so proud of you! Healing light and love to you! Xoxo
It is the hardest thing that you will go through. I am a caregiver for my husband who has Parkinson’s Disease. Life, as we have known, has changed. He was a guy always on the go: a teacher and principal, an athlete and a coach and that has changed. He uses a walker unless we want to go a bit further, then he has a scooter. But, the hardest thing to do is watch his short term memory come and go. As a caregiver there are times when I lose my patience and think that he should be able to do everything like he used to. After the impatience comes the guilt. I have been told by many people to not forget to take care of myself. Take care of Bec, but also take care of yourself. That may be hard at times, but it is very helpful. Sending prayers for both of you. Love your new room, especially the loft.
Excited to see a post! Missing you guys and hope everyone is doing well! Big hugs to Bec! Love y’all both! Xoxo
Luv you guys ~ continued love and prayers.  I’m so so sorry that y’all are going through this hard journey. 🤗😘🥰
Beautifully done, so nice to see friends and family come together to help out. 🧡
😂 Osso and that couch
Beautiful coloring, Bec🙌🏻🌸🙌🏻and the new room is beautiful too!!
Bob is def pushing me to get atheltic greens
Sooo good to see you both and the rest  of the Fam Hard Bec you 🎸🧘‍♀️ Hugs. Emon, thanks for allowing your  vulnerabilities in this  difficult time.  Please know you owe us nothing. I am sending you love and hugs. To end happy, you guys moving the 🐕Oso 🛋 couch made me laugh so hard!
About ag1 is it a subsription every month of 80$??
You both are so strong I just wanted to let you know keep it up back you are beautiful you have a gorgeous face and when your hair grows back it is going to be so healthy and shiny and beautiful. Stay positive you both got this. Thanks for the update you guys are amazing
If your dog eats too quickly you can get him a special bowl to slow him down. In regards to everything else, you are amazing but even the best of us need support and therapy can help keep you sane, to unload your emotions and help processing them. Special forces get therapy to process the horrors they see and experience. Talking about your emotions is never easy, it's probably the most difficult thing anyone can do, that's normal. What isn't fair on you is to keep it all in. You need support too. You, becks and your friends and family are awesome.
Love you guys and you have been in my thoughts.  So glad you put out this video!!!  Thanks and healing peace your way
Hello Eamon & Bec, during this difficult time love and support are super important, and most of all your trust in God, I personally have being through this process; so my prayers for you guys, hugs from Guatemala Central America 🙏🏻🤗
Thinking of you Beck, you got this. I have something called RSD long story storti got hurt at work and tured into that.only was in y let foot now have it in my whole body.I am very craft and loved making things now its hard and i color just like you were and it does help in many way..love you both
Becky you are doing so well it’s all hard but it’s nearly over, fingers crossed. Keep strong and you will get through it. Eamon you are a rock and you both will have time to chill and get your more normal life back. Hugs and love to you both
Jesus love can heal better than any yoga can. Yoga comes from false hindu beliefs, only true healing comes fromGod.
You guy’s are amazing , stay strong. Sending lots of love and prayers.

Ahhh poor Oso... He loved that couch. I was laughing so hard when he climbed on it while you were moving it out of the house 😂 Can't wait for the update about Bec! Lot's of love from the Netherlands, Daniëlle 😘🙋
A few days late her, Eamon...but sending so much love to you and Bec. Proud of you for opening up and I appreciate you doing so - I realize showing so much vulnerability online as a man can be difficult. Sending you hugs bud.
Keep doing what your doing.  Be strong i know its not easy.
❤️❤️❤️❤️💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🌏🌎🌍
Eamon,thank you for your transparency, but you don't owe us anything. You and Bec just do what you have to. We understand, and if there are those who don't, they can piss off!
I'm happy to see that you guys are okay
💕
AH Z https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE Z
Thanks for the update guys! I love you both so much! Sundays are always the best because I know a new video is coming out! I have been praying for you both, so please take time for yourselves to heal 🙏🏼 Oso is also the most adorable dog ever! Your cabin is looking beautiful!!  - All love from your two truck driving friends from Utah!
Eamon, your new workout space looks awesome. Glad you are channeling your energy in such a positive direction. Bec, you are doing great and looking strong. Better days are coming.
your relationship and support for each other is so refreshing to see. never fails in every video 💚 so happy you have a space to make your own that nurtures and shares with others who you are. sending you all the good vibes and love!
TIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMM HES BACK
Love you guys. Reno’s look great and nice to see you up and about Bec. Keep up the good fight. I just bought your cookbook. Can’t wait to use it. Xoxox
Fantastic job. An addition to the house.
Emon I really wish that you would let GOD in, not Religion just GOD himself, he would change your life Forever!!!
Art therapy the best and oh sooo beautiful.
My sister in law is in stage 4 and no hope.  My brother like you is fighting to be strong is there for her. His anxiety got out of control.  I have been doing meditation, working with energies to help release . Family visits.  I go up and stay with my sister in law so my brother can get out.  He loves watching his granddaughter play hockey.  The break does . Talking with nurses helps too. Sharing with each other seems to help and it gives my sister in law purpose.  She is a fighter.  Bec.is a fighter surrounded with love and support.  Sending healing love and energy
So much love for you guys!! The room looks great and Bec is looking great too!!
Love you guys hope you toing okey Eamon
Hope your Osso is your forever buddy. He fits your personality perfectly!  Lol
Oso is a little slice of smooshy love! He seems like a great source of joy for you guys. Sending love to you and Bec during this time ❤️
Love you bec you got this ❤️
Hugs
That looks awesome! Eamon you are so talented! Keep hanging in there guys! You got this! 👍👍🙂
Just wow. Real life right there. Love you guys! Stay strong 💪
So glad to see you again ☺️. Once again, you made me laugh and cry. Sending my ❤️ to you from Finland.
*hugs*
Came out great! Looks Phenomenal!  So much talent and hard work. ⭐️⭐️ Keep up your positivity Bec. 💜
I got introduced to those coloring books while in rehab (foot). I still do from time to time to reduce anxiety/stress. 💜
I've been super anxious for this video....always looking for your updates. Still praying for you guys!!
Having that as the main entry will save a ton on heating during the winter. Since you gave it it's own heat source instead of tying into the furnace. Glad to see basically everyone in this video I think 😂😂 even if Bob was just a video call 🤷🏻‍♀️😂 you all seem to be in good spirits and that's the best anyone can ask for right now!!
We love u Eamon and bec! I speak for the whole of Reading, UK! You owe us nothing, you’re strong! ❤️❤️❤️ sending you lots of love and light
Beautiful and Inspiring.
Don’t worry about the dark places. Because there is always someone on the outside with a light to guide you back.
Oso & the couch🤣🤣🤣🤣 I think he needs an upgrade from the trampoline. What a joyful addition to your family! Sending healing mana your way Bec😘
😂😂😂🐶
<3
The love I have for you guys is so real. You are both so inspirational and such beautiful people in so many ways. I admire your courageousness and your ability to overcome challenges, as we've seen with the van being broken in, leaving the van in Africa, to everything else we don't see. Bec you are a warrior and you will absolutely beat this. Know that we all love you and are sending you healing energy and the utmost positivity.  Your beauty and spirit are unmatched! I look up to you so so so much. Eamon your strength and perseverance to do everything you can to make sure Bec is comfortable and able to focus on wellness is beyond admirable. I am sending you so much love as you navigate something so hard - this too shall pass. You are the definition of a great man and it's clear why Bec and you love each other so much. This kind of connection is rare. I really know in my heart you two will come out stronger than ever from this, and thank you for sharing your journey with us and being so raw and real. You both are incredible humans and I wish I could give you the biggest hugs. You've got this guys! <3
You both have been so great stay strong and come out the other side at a sprint I hope soon all the best from Scotland
Stay strong you two, You’ve got this!! Sending love from Portsmouth, England. Xx
I think about you every day.  You are both   finding the strength, not only to move through this (unwelcome) journey but to continue to achieve goals including coloring, relaxation and progress on your place.  Peace and love to you!
I don't know how you two do it, but you are an inspiration to me.  In the same circumstances,  I would hope to be half as brave as the two of you.  You guys are the personification of the life force--it's amazing!
💛💛💛💛💛
I’m going to add Bec n Eamon n family to my prayers.. can u all add Kaylee my orphan granddaughter with cancer second time age 20 ... thanks

Bec, sending love, positive thoughts, healing light and prayers.  Eamon, as I sit here looking at m y 27 year old prepare for heart surgery to replace a severely infected valve post Covid infection, I understand the frustration and pain of watching your loved one go through the worst time of their life and not being able to fix it. Yesterday they found areas on his brain and said they may be strokes from the endocarditis, infection that spread to the brain, or cancer; my heart broke as I know yours did with Bec's diagnosis. Stay strong I am sending you positive thoughts, love, and prayers.  Love you both and look forward to Bec's last treatment. ❤️
Oso is a legend, love y'all❤
Ohh! and you look so good Bec! ❤️❤️
Bob drinks it??? I’m sold.
Just want to say.. How strong you both are in those difficult times.. I respect you guys a lot ❤️ Wish you all the best and more good days ahead!! 🥰 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Ohso wanted his couch back lol how cute
💖🐱‍👤
Much love to both of you.
Hi friends it turned out really amazing. Take care of yourselves I continue to pray for you in the Holy Land of Israel as well.
Loved seeing your faces. Miss you and wish you the very best.  Do not fear or be dismayed. Deuteronomy 33:27 The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. Psalm 34:17 When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their troubles. Isaiah 30:15 In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength.
So proud of both of you. As someone that has been there done that I wish you both a long and happy life when this journey is done. Eamon caregiving is just as hard as being the patient. Give yourselves grace and gratitude
🥺🥺🥺🥺get well soon beck...stay strong u guys🥺🥺❤️❤️
Yaaay finally a video from you both ..  so happy to see bec and everyone ... Osso stole the show ... Lots of love ❤️
OSo is osoooooofunny and great to watch.  Ilaughsooooo hard every time I watch his antics.  What a great companion.  Love you guys. Praying  for miraculous super fast from father god healing for bec.     Adam, I figured as much about Eamon.  .     Lol.
I love your funny voice overs!  Keep on keeping on, we all love the laughter and so authentic you both are, you make me proud to be Canadian.  What an amazing healing space.  So much talent.
Ok poor Oso I don’t know if I could have given my dog’s favorite couch lol. But really I couldn’t do it 😊
So great to see you guys!! ♥️ And the porch looks amazing, love a good Reno video. Here for the algorithm ;) 🤘🏽
Was waiting patiently for your next video. Joe from Buffalo NY here. Hope all is going in a positive direction. Bec always prayers for you. I'm 64 and my wife is 63. I want you to know I appreciate my wife more and more and seeing you and Eamon and feeling the love, it's catchy for me. Appreciation and love is so important. Eamon should start a design/consulting site because he does some great work and his ideas work!
👏🏼
So nice. San Antonio Spurs shout out!!!
I am just so proud of the two of you. you guys make a great team! I also love all the work you have been doing on the cabin, I have learned so much from watching you guys do things. A BIG THANK YOU TO YOU YOU ARE JUST AMAZING!!!! Prayers for a speedy recovery, hugs and kisses to you both!!!
💗
My mother is about to start chemo and we're all super nervous for her. It's so overwhelming and scary but I have to agree with keeping busy it definitely helps so much. Sending lots of love and prayers your way xo
Absolutely love the room, love and healing light to you both
You're getting there Bec..well done it must be tough for you both..Eamon you did an amazing job along with family members on your new gym..looks amazing ! It's hard to see how it's affecting you both but thank you for sharing your journey with us all x
Everything with the builds are looking awesome.  Glad to see you both staying strong through everything. I know how tough it can be. Just recently I lost my mom, and it’s been difficult for me there. Like you said Eamon, got to try to stay focus and keep yourself going.    Bec, I have to say that you have a beautiful glow about you, and I wish you the best. You both have many here for you through these times, but keep strong like you have been and we all look forward to many more vids.  Thank you so much for always being real and sharing your life with us.
❤️ ❤️  much love to all of you
Hi, Libby from Ontario!  You guys have to know that you’re more than relationship goal. You guys are life goals. From van life and vegan to cottage owning pup parents. Hardships never seem to hold you down.  Coming from someone with anxiety and chronic depression you always seem to keep the darkest corners of my heart bright. I always look to your videos for inspiration and motivation. Your voices and positivity always seem to get me back on track.  Thank you for being so awesome buddies! So much love!
Excellent jo bon the porch. Think your dog was very attached to the sofa, that bit made me laugh so much! Love to you both, you will both get thru this and I'm sure you will have a stronger relationship and have a fresh perspective on life herein. 👫💪😏
Tiny support across the Pacific. I've been in Eamon's position and it's hard, so it's okay to be not okay sometimes. Give yourself a bit of "not okay" time blow off some steam and you are back again. Bec, you are VERY Strong and am sending you all the love and spiritual support by brainwave. 🧠🧠🧠
Loved the video and loved the real talk with Eamon! You did a great job on the room.
Sending you guys so much love <3
Osso is Oh-so special ❤️❤️❤️ A bundle of happiness that brings joy to all 🥰 there is so much we can learn from him 🐕
Love you guys, and truly enjoy seeing the genuine love you share with each other and for life in general. You both are a breath of fresh air, even going throw your toughest moments you still inspire. Thanks to the energy you have I tune in weekly. Thank you for being you! God bless and you all are in my thoughts and prayers.
How amazing you both are ❤️
Hey...You're rocking the bald girl! Your look like Selma Hyiak, movie star! I loved being bald. Your cancer friend, one year out. Heather from Cambridge. Ps Hope springs has a chat group for cancer patients every tues. We talk about everything under the sun vacation, forgiving your body for betraying us, the lack of energy, dealing with the side affects of chemo. etc....You would love it. Sleep well.
I dont know why, but immediately when this video started i got so emotional, teary eyes and happy. The life you guys have created for yourselves is so BEAUTIFUL.
Loved this Xxx
Sending you all the love and health from the Netherlands.
Thank you for sharing your amazing transformation of your workout space! Praying for you both as you continue healing. 💕🙏
You are both incredibly inspiring. I think about the both of you all the time, sending all the best wishes always. The strength you guys have as individuals and as a couple is incredible. Eamon you've always been the rock for Bec, support is always around for you too if you ever need which is incredibly important. Glad to know you're hanging in there, all the love and thoughts for you guys xxx
Just a suggestion for the dog, although probably way too late now.  They have inflatable neck rings, like an airline pillow kind of, for post surgery. They work great!  No loss of peripheral vision and running into things.  Him getting on the couch was hilarious.
Does the wiring go behind or in front of the spray foam insulation?
My daughter, she's 10, and I love you two. Bec he's a mess without you. Now pull it together and get well.  Please ....... 🙏
Eamon if u have a poolnoodle u can make a cone without the satalite 😅 u can cut it in pieces the size of your hand en string it on a collar. Then he cant move his head in the same style as the cone
My dudes…can you do your own spray foam insulation? X
We’re keeping the love coming at ya! The room looks incredible. Eamon really had a vision & its amazing to see it come into reality!!! Also glad to see that you put Fraser to work 😂. Much love 💚💚🥒🥒
Hey guys. We might be on the opposite side of the world but just wanted to let you know that we miss you. Take care of each other and know that we are all here for you. Big squishy hugs from us to you.
Eamon...Thanks for opening up. I can't empathize how this is on both of you. Love and prayers.Bec you're a trooper. glad to see all the family in on the project.
❤️💯
So glad to see you are winning this fight Bec! Eamon, you are the man!!! I love how you are working so hard to improve your home and the love you are filling Bec with! I actually started to cry as soon as I saw you had a new video. I mentioned to my partner how worried I was about both of you. Thank you for being such wonderful, strong, loving humans. 💖💖💖
Excellent,  love DIY ❤️,  watched your vlog with my kids,  tell Buc she is beautiful 😍 u both doing great keeping bz n hopeful ur all kith n kin with u  in happy n tough times see life is beautiful.

This dog made me laugh so much hahaha
Hey man I think you should look into the Pheonix Protocol by August Dunning. Rooting for y'all.
I was so happy to see you guys 😍 that I almost cried but then was too busy laughing at Osso and you guys.  Looking beautiful as ever Bec.  Love and thoughts from Darwin Australia ❤

Still keeping you both in my thoughts!
Lots of love, support and energy from France!
Stay strong, Eamon!!!
Bec's dad looks like a young Steve Martin! So handsome!
Eamon... This is the first time ever I saw you cry in a video. It touched my heart. But you are both so positive and go on with your life in the best way you can. I'm very proud of you. You both! Love from Germany.💛
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for the vulnerability with complete strangers Eamon
Do you people have any idea how many views you are missing out on, by the fact that when a user clicks your video, he gets an add of 15 to 20 seconds that can't be skipped ? I have to assume it's a lot, especially with the aggressiveness that Youtube has chosen lately to bombard users that are not premium with the ads...and not just 5 sec ads, but 15 and 20 seconds consecutive ads that can't be skipped....for a total of 35s...ain't that some sh*t
Thank you for sharing for everyone to see
First time I have ever posted anything but I watch so many utubers. You kinging it, nomadic kingdom, Trent and Allie all of the Crockers   My husband passed away four years ago yesterday he was 66 1/2 we met when we were both 14 and freshman   I married my first husband at 20, our beautiful son was born when we were 23 divorced at 27 and married the love of life at 30 Brandon was born nine months to the day later.  He had lots of heart issues and all that goes with that. But we had a great life because we loved each other so much. You both show your love to each other and respect your thoughts. Thank you for sharing your beautiful life with all of us. It help me get through long nights, it’s is 1:27 am in California your love will warm your hearts and help your healing  Love you both, bob, Tim all your family and friends and of course Bear!!
Hope you have a little more peace with that sharing moment. Most important is if it helps you.
it’s been so much fun to watch the whole cabin transformation, seeing one of those videos was amazing. and i just want to say i think it’s so brave for eamon to share his thoughts and feelings. sending so much love and light to the both of you! ♥️
Beautiful space! Sending prayers for both of you during this season 🙏🏻💗
I’ve been wondering how you guys are getting on. It can’t be easy for either of you so thanks for the gift of sharing a bit of your story Eamon. Arohanui kōrua from Aotearoa xoxo
I've never met you guys and I've only been watching a short time, but I feel like I know you both. I hang out for new vids and I think it's just like watching two friends you don't get to see all that often, but still care deeply about. Eamon, know that everything you're feeling is valid, and even if you don't vlog it or speak to a counselor about it all, write it in a diary. You may never read it again ,but it's the minds way of saying its been recorded. Elated to see little Bec cameos around the place, I'm so happy to see you're still the radiant, energetic bec that keeps me coming back for more content. Love you both and sending love from Qld, Australia!
I trust god an his plan for Bec life, This too shall pass.
So amazing. So strong mentally too and supportive.  Love to you both x
Literally got so happy to see the thumbnail!!Love love love these kind of videos!! Also keeping Bec on our prayers 🙏🏼
❤️❤️❤️❤️for the both of you!
You are both BEAUTIFUL. Thank you 🙏❤️🙏 For sharing beauty with us ❤️🙏❤️
I freaking love you guys !! Bec you look amazing your so beautiful inside and out ! Eamon way to go bud that entry way looks great!! I think Eamon you do a fantastic job with the video's oseo is so cute, I laughted with him and his cone lol...Thank you for sharing your lives with us! Thought and prayers everyday !
I love the porch. It’s gorgeous. Bec you’re looking great. I know it’s been rough but you have such an amazing outlook and a beautiful smile. Continued prayers for the two of you. ❤️❤️
So good to hear from you! Did you get something to replace your dog’s couch?  He really loved the you gave away.
❤️❤️❤️
Take it 1 day at a time. Sometimes that may feel like it’s to much. Then work it from a breath at a time.. I’m just out of stage 4 ovarian cancer and I honestly can’t believe that I made it this far.. it’s still no picnic at this end. I am just getting over a nasty kidney and bladder infection which triggered the surrounding muscles in protective mode and would clench down on my inflamed insides… stay vigilant about germs and people.. you guy got this
Osoe is  such a good boy when h3 Weights to eat my puppy would never do that she has to wait to food motivated
Hey Eamon  you have been an amazing support for Bec. You are both in my thoughts and prayers 💕💕
Aw, I love that your families got involved helping you. Still sending much love from the UK to both of you xx
Clearly, you did not check with Oso first.
Eamon, so glad you are trying to open up. Being the caretaker people forget how hard it is for you. Prayers to you all for continued positive vibes.
You guys are amazing in so many ways! I for one feel blessed to get a view into your lives and feeling like I know you and definitely care about you both. One day hope to meet you both. It was so courageous of you Emon to open up like that. I can feel how extremely challenging it is for you watching the love of your life go through this knowing you have no control on the outcome. Only prayer! So I’m sending support prayers to you and to Bec for strength to help guid you both through this challenging twist in your life’s journey! Much Aloha 🌺🤙🏻🙏🏻🌈☀️💗
If you started a YOUTUBE channel just for OSO, I would totally watch it!! :D    what a incredibly smart dog!   I loved watching him physically BEG you to "PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY COUCH"   and his escapades with being a cone-head totally cracked me up... I do remember the stress of raising a DOG and having those darn cones for as long as possible.    sending HUGS and LOVE to you all!!   Hang in there! <3 <3 <3
wow Eamon, thank you! loved seeing this! love you guys!

Omg the cracked me up
Omg So awesome to see u guys. Chase and I were laughing sooo hard at Osso/couch. Eamon, thx for sharing your feelings it helps to get it out. Bec u r as beautiful as ever Chase says 💗.   🇨🇦 we think about you guys often. Stay strong, stay beautiful and keep on swimming Bec.  From London, Ont.
Feeling all of the feels watching this vlog today. Thinking of you both - you've been dealt a rough hand these past couple of years and it's inspiring to see you both remain so optimistic and strong with everything you're both going through. Sending love your way always x
Whomever edited this video = Rockstar! Very entertaining and put together
Hi Eamon and Bec, it was so good to see you both. Been wondering how Bec is feeling and how you are doing Eamon. So raw to see you both and sending so much healing and hugs to you both. Xx PS the Gym looks amazing. You all did such a great job. 🤗💜🤗💜
Haha get away from the wife lol man cave....
Coming in hot with the doggo content! Love it. You are both an inspiration to so many … with your positivity, enthusiasm, and love of life. You are loved by so many.
Love you guys. Get better bec. Good job On the gum.
Much love to you both!! ❤️❤️❤️
Oh is that a pull up bar bolted to the loft? Nice!
Love you guys!! You are such a strong couple, as everybody you need love, but a little bit more from us!😉 I hope to be here to support every moment. ❤❤
Hey Eamon, I hope you can get some support from other partners who have a loved one having cancer treatment, its really important to talk to people who really "get it" and to be able to talk, cry, laugh and support each other away from your loved one, and where you can be totally open and just turn into a heaving pile of crying jelly... ya know...   Thinking about you both and sending loving peace and healing to you both.
We love you guys too pieces 💜💜💜💜💜..
🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈…🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰.
So much respect for you all💙 Eamon your vlog is great and thank you for being vulnerable! Good to see u working on projects again. So sweet the whole family helps. And praying for you all. Bec you are half way! 🙏🏼🌈🍀
Bec's dad reminds of Steve Martin!
I love both of you guys i have been praying for Bec's full recovery and for you Eamon to stay strong for her during this difficult time, you guys are like family to me i love your videos and i can't wait to see more. God bless you both stay safe🙏. Mike from NYC
Next time, get Oso a pool noodle and slice it into chunks, run his collar through it. It will keep his neck unable to bend enough to keep him from pestering his parts! He’s a million dollar dawg. Keep him safe...you too. Hugs to you both and Oso.
I love you stay well both of you and emon your so incredible
Beautiful! So glad to see you two workin’ through the tough times like champs. ❤️🏆❤️
Love it you guys i love you all

Bob is a legend!
We in America send a lot of love and prayers to you and Bec! Oso is goofy and sweet! I had "Ruby" with me during my chemo. Ruby was a chihuahua-whippet mix who crossed the "rainbow bridge " last year in the middle of the year. I now have a new sidekick, Princess Sadie,  a Schnauzer-Dachund mix ! I'm also in remission from Non-hodgkin's lymphoma! Thank God! You Two are surrounded with Love and prayers! Emmanuel Baptist church family is praying! Christ worship center church family is praying too! New Hope Baptist church family is praying for you two! I got everyone in N.J. U.S.A praying for you! You can't do anything else but get well! Believe! God has got you Sweetie!
Wow!  The porch looks great!  Bec you are looking great too!  Always thinking about you two!  Spring is here...with a wee bit of snow for fun...not long now!
Bec! You look so beautiful with no hair 😍 we love you both so much! ❤
Oso is the best pupper
You should invite the realtor who sold you the cabin to see it now, bet she'd be thrilled.
Yes Brighter Days!! The new space looks wonderful nice work! Thanks for the update on how you both are doing, love your smiling faces. Continued Prayers to you both.  Oso is hilarious.
Fabulous vlog, Eamon! Another task you have shouldered and raised to excellence! Tell Ms. Bec I am now officially jealous, I want a buddy like you! If that vlog award thingie doesn’t have a category for you two, we need to invent one. How about “warm, decent people sharing their lives with the world and giving us all hope for this sorry old world.” Much love to you both.
Eamon you gotta know you are the bomb. Please take care of you and Bec you keep kicking Cancer’s ass!!! You two are the bomb.
soo good to see an update from you guys! Great work on the porch! That tongue and groove looks amazing, Bec! And Eamon, great work being handy, keeping busy and positive. It's good to see you smile. Sending hugs and prayers!
Looks absolutely fantastic!!!! Love you both!
Great video, the room turned out great.  So glad to see Bec!
You are both on my prayer list with all my friends and family. Love and blessings. Keep strong Bec, it's hard to believe but this to shall pass. Sometimes like an elephant thru a straw but it will be over before you know it and like me will be seeing the 10 year C free in the rear view mirror.
Bec + Eamon = an amazing team. You guys are beautiful so happy to see you guys. Bec you got this. Eamon so happy to see you staying positive for your family. 😘😘
I’m so glad to see a new video.  You two have been on my heart.
🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍🦮👏👏👏
Keep on keeping on! You're the bomb!
Oso stole the show in this vlog! Between the cone issues and the loss of his couch I was laughing so hard🤣💜. So glad you posted this update as you have both been on my mind. My family and I have been praying for you both🙏. You are both so amazingly strong together....keep fighting!
Thank you for the laugh.  🐾🐾😂🤣 I really needed that. Poor puppy losing his sofa. ☹️.   Eamon and Bec My thoughts and prayers coming your way from Kitchener. ❤️❤️
Sending love to all of you. PS your dog is hilarious.
Eamon & Bec.. Or Anyone.. Give me a address so I can send Bec a special gift I have for her?
You killed it once again! It looks bloody brilliant!!
🤎
Hugs!!!
Amazing 👏 job well done ✔
Love you guys!! The room looks greaaaat! Love it
you can totally tell this was a video where Eamon went full force with exploring his creative process!! Totally here for it
You two are the sweetest ever! Continued love and healing for both of you💜🕊💜
That dog is too funny. How dare you take his favorite bed.
You guys are such a breathe of fresh air, so beautiful, positive and inspiring!  Sending love, strength and prayers 🙏
Hey Eamon I am so proud of you being so strong for Bec and your self as well too. I will keep both of you in my prayers keep staying strong my brother. Angel Franks from Florence Alabama
What breed is Oso?
Hugs and 💘😻
Thanks for letting us, "in," Eamon. Never easy to watch a loved one suffer. As a former grief and bereavement counsellor, I really applaud your self awareness of what you require to maintain mental wellness (as much as can be expected during such a difficult period). Diving into work has saved me during similar circumstances. Soooo great to see Bec in good energy and kicking C's ass! After everything that has occurred (Lee, COVID, etc) I hope that we get to see you enjoy a celebration of love and life...*cough cough wedding cough*.
Made my old heart happy to see your smiling faces … times are  trying for this 79/87 year couple , so we love spending a 1/2 hour or so living vicariously thur your  renovations … it’s heartwarming to see how various family members pop in to help and check on you and Bec …. Sending you light and love , hugs Sue & Arthur … ps we just had our  4th shot (2nd booster)  today …. Go Canada 🍁
Just loved how your dog did not want that couch to go 😍😂
Xoxo
Prayers from Maine! Stay safe and string. You both have this! 🙏🌸🌻🌺
The FRIENDS edit almost took me out 😂 I forgot about that scene lol
I am so happy for you Eamon. I am glad you had a project to work on. Sending my love always to you both
I love the point of view of Oso eating lmao. Hope you guys are doing well. Sending love to you guys.
Praying for you both. 😎
Y’all are awesome 🙏
SOooo GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL !!  PORCH LOOKS AMAZING ( hope this time you pulled a permit for it ...lol ) ...  but i cant believe you didnt buy Osso at least a new love-seat !!!  it would fit perfect next to the bike !! haha !!
The room looks good. Nice job.
What an awesome video!  Eamon I loved how much you played and video taped Bear.  He didn’t want to let that couch go 🤣😂🤣  So precious how he is with Bec 🐾💗🐾 The room is absolutely gorgeous.   Great job to you both.  Hugs 🤗 being sent!!!  You are always on my mind and in my heart. 💋
Great job on the gym! Looks fantastic!
I'm so glad you guys are doing well.  I was like everyone else and starting to worry.  The room looks beautiful!
one word: BEAUTIFUL!!!
just placed an order from your shop and will be ordering more soon and I’m about to put an order for your Chai Tea ☕️ I’ve never tried so I definitely want your brand to be what I experience first!🤍 I tear up seeing this happen to y’all but y’all are so strong!🥹 I’ve been watching y’all for YEARS now and I never expected this to happen.. you’re so beautiful Bec and have a beautiful heart I’ve been wanting to support y’all more for so long and I’m more than excited that I’m able to today!🥹
You both are such an inspiration.  Sending you good vibes!!
Eamon I’m praying for strength and healing❤️
My goodness, Bec is pretty!
You're both so inspirational. The front room likes sensational and I'm taking notes so I can duplicate some of the gym storage you created! 💜 Love and healing light to you both.
You should look into a heat pump for the space. We have one in our studio space and it is amazing! Heat in the Winter and AC in the Summer all from one small unit!
Caring for someone who is going through chemo is tough. But she needs you. Be strong!
thanks for taking us along! Oso is HILarious 😍
Bears (Osso’s?) little love nibble on becs foot 💕🥺 sweet puppy. Thanks for sharing this even when its so hard ❤️
Love you guys thank you for the both of you and everything and all you guys do.
oso is such a hilarious dog...on another note, eamon what you said really spoke volumes about how maturely you're dealing with this.  doing something productive with your grief (like literally building a sun room from scratch, you're killing it btw) instead of moping around will really give bec a positive atmosphere to heal in, so i am so so glad to see you staying busy.  love you guys :)
To Bec:Keep your chin up, you wild Canadian. We are not done with you yet. To Eamon: Remember, Bec is strong and loves you. Help her heal by letting her heal you.
As always, the two of you make me smile, laugh & cry right along with you. You’re both amazing. Bec, I know this is so hard for you, there aren’t words. Eaton, I’m right there with you. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in December and the treatment is brutal. It’s a helpless feeling but one day at a time.  You two are amazing! Many prayers and positive thoughts coming your way, both of you! 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
lots of love to you two, nothing but positive vibes coming at ya :) Great job on the work out room!
Osso was not giving up that couch without a fight!  😆.
Damon and Bec, you know how much we love you both! Eamon, you're allowed to cry, to vent, to be pissed off at the cancer. Bec, you are a warrior woman! Rest when you need to, eat small healthy meals often. Crafts and coloring are food for your soul. Sending hugs, prayers, and positive vibes to you all! 🙏❤🙏❤
We love you guys you’re amazing !!!
We love you ❤️
I can not  put into words the love I feel thru this darn iPad for you two lovely people who I have never met but love dearly.  I pray for you both! Love love love!
Osso and that couch...really made me belly laugh....transformation and your array of apprentices was great. Hard times for you both....but your positivity and love for each other is such a winning combo. Lots of love NN Jude 🥰 I from the tropics in Queensland, Australia 🇦🇺 First met you guys on La Vagabonde.
God blessed Bec you are strong 💪🏽
You are both so brave! Love and strength winging it's way to you from New Zealand ❤🙏
Amazing bright energy all up in here!!!  Looking BOSS!!!
Wow great work!
I was so happy to see this update!  The room reno is amazing!  Great job Eamon!  Hang in there kids, spring is around the corner!
So happy to see Bec! I have been checking every day hoping for a new video to see how she is doing. Still in my thoughts and prayers. I am on a cancer journey as well but not having to deal with everything Bec is at this time.
Can you put a camera on ozo for a second view!
You both amaze me every time you guys upload. The love and care you both have for one another is amazing to see. Continued thoughts and prayers to both of you. The world is behind y’all 💕
you are  beautiful bec inside and out 💜
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Hugs. Simply hugs. You’re both amazing.
There are so many words I would say to you in personal, but now I just want to let you know that I’m thinking of you once a day. Eamon you are brave and very strong showing us your emotions. Feel hugged! Both! ❤️
Always crushing it you two. Keep it up.
Still sending you love Bec! Eamon, you are such a great support. I have to say that couch section with Ohso was laugh out loud funny!  Also, Ohso + cone = wrecking ball!
Well done guys. It’s perfect. What a good job you all did in it. Xx
We used a cloud collar for our furball the last time he had surgery and it was a GAME CHANGER. So much more tolerable than the dreaded cone! Recommend the Kong Cloud but there are others.
I laughed so hard at your beautiful dog I cried. He is so entertaining. Keep the fight going. I have breast cancer and  this is my second go around. Your journey is important to all of us as we need others to keep us positive!!! Your porch is phenomenal. This was my favorite of all your videos. Love and healing to you and yours. Thank you for the honest and positive way you help others by sharing your experience. Hugs
What youve done with that porch… It takes my breath away! Love you both and continue to pray for complete healing for Bec.
Bec you are beautiful 😍 and very strong 💪
Through all  theses comments hopefully you guys see how much you mean to us!  💕 You  both are couple goals! Also love as well that cute funny adorable couch loving Osso of yours! Too funny! 🐕🐾..Great video .Thanks for sharing  all this with us! Such great  humans & spirits oxo...Bec so glad to see you having some fairly good days through this difficult new health journey with the great support of Eamon and your loved ones!
A great thing for dogs if he is still in a cone now is something called a dog donut. It’s like a neck pillow for dogs but serves the same purpose as a cone! My dog loved it and didn’t try to rip it off once! Definitely 100000% recommend
You both are such an inspiration and big life teachers for me and am sure for many many of us out here. ❤️ Sending love, strength and the best energy to my favorite couple ever! ✨
the porch looks amazing. love u guys!!
“It’s not dinnertime yet, dude!” I had that conversation with my dog today who also used to go by Bear.
Hello from Worcestershire in the UK. Love following you two (and Oso) and the journey you're all going through right now. I was hooked on Schitts Creek (brilliant Canadian export) and now you. Good luck and keep going, my heart melts.
When your both in your mid 80s you'll look back on this part of your lives as faded memories some not so good but thats ok much love and peace to u both ❤
The place looks great! Strong work guys!
Love you guys so much and Becca you are the strongest woman I have ever seen and Ramon you are an amazing supporter for bec your prayers and thoughts always in my head
just a beautiful vid guys ❤
I’m here for the dog content.
So happy for you two! The strength and courage you have is so inspiring. And very proud of your work Eamon! The new room looks amazing! 💖 Prayers to kick this "c" to the curb! 🙏💖🙏
hello Eamon and Bec i am Canadian and i live in Halifax Nova Scotia and that porch turned out so nice all of my support goes to you guys. you guys are awesome eamon and bec keep well your the best love you guys and Oso.
PRAYERS!!!!  WITH LOTS OF ""LOVE""    ALL THE WAY FROM INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA USA 🇺🇲💯❤️ And the room looks great buddy....
I’m so glad to see you both! You have been missed.
You have so much love surrounding you!! It’s a show of your character and love you show to others!! I was so happy I see the notification just like everyone else here. We love you. Feel all your feelings they are good. I’m also so glad you have adopted a dog❤️❤️❤️
You guys are so amazing and inspiring! Praying for you both and major healing for Bec!!!
Osso is beautiful and smart!! What a cutie - Lucky you guys 😊 Sending you and Beck lots of good vibs, Love and healing energy!  You guys will pull this, just believe it and it will manifest  We all LOve you guys - take care you and many best wishes ❤️🌟❤️🌟❤️🌟❤️🌟❤️🌟❤️🌈
Hey its hard to open up but it helps you and us. Keep up the great work!
Oso=LMFAO!!!! Great video, love you guys and love, hugs and strength to you both. Bec, you got this!
OSSO!!!!!  Have to get him more screen time!  Such cute paws.
no drywall makes you a soy boy
your next job is putting in a garden,, get seeding ,,, you got to grow your own food and NOW!!!
I just found your channel today through the K&N video where you camped on the raft. Even though I haven't followed you, I was so sad to hear of Beck's cancer. I'm rooting for you two. Both of you! I know postpartum was hard for us and my husband had a hard time going through that with me. So, definitely don't neglect either of you.  Postpartum showed me that we don't take time in our society to slow down. Not for birth, not death, not sickness. So, when you slow down and prioritize health, it can be a hard shift. Thinking of you two, sending you positivity and strength. - love from BC.
u got to stop eating that beyond meat too,, all that fake meat has human dna in it. even human liquified remains. mcdonalds was created to sell 1 doller human meat burgers from all the people the so called church was torturing and killing for adrenachrome. there is a video out about it. yes mcdonalds was started by the church,, satan loves to hide in the church. clearly eamon,, look at catholosism. get some non gmo soybeans make your own tofu if you have to or if you can buy non gmo tofu and make  your own crumble you know its easy. maybe if you can wrap your mind around the human meat thing you will be closer to understanding what modern medicine is doing. we are at war eamon the good guys against the bad guys and if you keep financing the bad guys by buying their products how can we win? think about it please.
The rap and the dancing lol 🤣🤣
Sending so much love and healing energy to you guys, and your beautiful cabin 🤗✨
I cant tell you how happy I was to see this video. I have missed you both. Bec you look amazing. So glad you are more than halfway through now.  The porch is awesome. Great job. Just like the rest of the cabin.  Eamon, you are the best. I know it is so hard when you have to see your love so sick. Celebrate the great days and before long this will all be a distant memory and you will both have your best life going forward. Love you guys. Lots of hugs and prayers.
You are loved
You are loved❤️
First off AMAZING VIDEO!! Sending prayers your way!! Becs energy is unmatched!! What an example she is!! God Bless!!
Eamon, your showing us your emotional challenges was so sweet and real.  It’s something men don’t show often, so I really appreciate it. Being a cancer/chemo survivor I know how hard it was on my man. Men on the whole like to fix problems, and when it’s beyond being able to fix it’s difficult and painful. I’m sure Bec appreciates the love and support that you so sweetly provide for her. There is nothing better than that!  Having someone there emotionally for you really rises you up. I wish you the best as you’ve both reached the half way point in the chemo treatments.  And it’s good to see that you are keeping busy with your project. Oh, and thanks for the video of your dog. It cracked me up and was the best belly laugh I’ve had in awhile. So thanks for that too!
God  Bless and keep you, may his face shine upon you and give you peace. 🙏❤️.
❤
So happy to see you two doing well.  Thoughts and prayers with you!   Keep fighting!
you owe no one anything besides peace on yourself. we love you! do what’s best for you! wishing you both wellness❤️
Praying for you both! Take it one day at a time. You have a community out here that supports you. :)
Why did y get another dog when you both did such a bad job with Moussa! Poor dog!
Great to hear from you guys. All the best xx
Hi Eamon if you’re reading this, thank you for opening up and being vulnerable to us but don’t feel like you owe us anything. I just hope you have someone that you feel comfortable opening up and talking to. And thank you for doing your best to be a rock for Bec, it’s safe to say that I speak on behalf of all your viewers that you are doing amazing and you can and you will get through this ❤️
Lost his couch then his nuts poor dog .Lots of love to you both from Scotland.
You two are awesome! So much love ❤️ keep it up and before you know it you'll be traveling again!
Hou all are so precious!   I was never that brave to be bald.  I hid it. But youre amazing!    I luvvvvvv the new weight room!   Gave me some ideas!!
Just wondering, I know spray foam is more expensive compared to fiber glass insulation. Does it work better at keeping heat in or is it more eco? The room turned out great! Can't wait to see what your next project is Eamon!
This dog is way too much when I’m trying to do cardio at the gym 🤣🤣🤣🥰 I love it . Hope you guys are all doing well x
Sending prayers for God's healing.
Eamon you are amazing, and Bec you are one of they strongest women I've seen on YouTube, stay strong, and God bless love ya Nancy
Great job, love it!! Loved seeing family joining in to help. Loved seeing you Bec ❤️❤️
Happiness from start to finish :)  Glad to see that BOTH of you are doing well and smiling!  Love the room (and the dog)... AND seeing you guys once again.  Seems like I'm always looking to see how you are.  Sending love and hugs! <3
The dog on the sofa was hilarious!  🤣🤣🤣
You have an hilarious pup. Can’t get enough of him. You both are terrific people.
I'm sorry but Oso stole the show haha.  What a dog haha.
@eamon thank you for being honest and transparent. There is a reason why caregivers are also needing care too. So excited to see your faces but also know time away is needed for this battle.
How cute was Oso with his sofa!! 🤣 I honestly think you should have kept it somewhere purely so he could sit on it. The Porch is looking amazing! This was an excellent video! Thanks also for the honest and open update on how Eamon is doing. I've been thinking about you both and wondering how you are both doing very often over the past few weeks. All the best for the last few rounds of Bec's chemo. Xxx
Thank you for being so transparent, I love you both and praying for you guys. 🙏😘❤️
Thank you again for sharing your lives with all of us.  I feel I can speak for everyone in this community when I say that we are here for you for what ever you need.  It’s hard to put yourself in a vulnerable position and reveal your feelings, whether they are posit e or negative, but you have to get them out there.  Thank you for trusting us.  Keep on being busy, playing with Oso, hugging each other

I love it!!!! It’s so beautiful!!!🤍 So proud of you Bec keep being strong!!! Proud of you too Eamon!! Bec is beyond lucky to have you!! Love y’all!!!🤍
I want to buy a sweatshirt but I cannot find your merch site. Can you give me the link or are you sold out currently?
Oso cracked me up at the start of this! Poor boy didn't want his couch to go.  I've been thinking of you both, I keep checking back in on the channel to see if I've missed a video. Glad to see an update from Bec is coming soon. Hope you both are doing well ❤
Love you both so much ❤️
wow! the place looks incredible, the vision is there 🔥
Love for jou from Holland...i burned my candle on Lee day Thinking of you.......   Big hughs

You guys have made a shabby cabin into a luxury home. Good work guys.
💚🤍💙 to you all and the new room!
i love you guys!! this vlog made me smile (with Oso especially lol). love how the porch turned out too!
Room turned out amazing. Laughed and cried during this video.....Stay strong.
Oso needs his own channel 🥰
Stay strong.I know how you feel. It's very painful to see the one you love going through this horrible thing. You are strong and young, you will get through this together. Bec is so beautiful inside and out
That OSo moment restored my faith in humanity. Dog Bless (dyslexics get my drift).
She looks so stunning, I hope she doesn’t think of herself any different. Her energy, her aura! Everything about her is just so radiant.  I hope I can meet the both of you one day that would be awesome 🥰
Well done on the new room it looks amazing and was so good to see you both having a dance and enjoying yourselves,  you are both I our thoughts and prayers sending love from the UK xx
You are both in our prayers everyday. Stay strong. It’s good to see you and you family.

So sorry for all the bad times your both going through,  neither of you deserve this , you both bring so much joy , happiness and laughter to us all , I suffer with my mental health and really enjoy , appreciate watching your vlogs . Please find strength in all your support from viewers , friends and family,  so lucky .

love you buddy's!
Keep on Keepin On ✌️💕
❤️
The room is beautiful.    I think it will get lots of use. Your updates on the cottage have been seriously transformational.    Flip it!                 (No!)
smiles, tears, soo many emotions..... so happy to see you guys again and you are both amazing!
Sending positive vibes!!! Take care!!! xxx from Hungary
Continuing to send all the love I can your way.  If its ok ... I'll light a candle for you both tonight.
Sending positive vibes and love for all of you guys! Stay 💪 ❤️
The room looks amazing y’all! ♥️
You both have done an amazing job on the cabin, love it so much.  You are both in my prayers EVERYDAY.   Love you both so much.
I didn't watch you before this journey so I don't know how your content was before this BUT you guys have shown me what having a true partner in life looks like. I was married, now divorced, and it was not a good relationship and I couldn't imagine going through that without having that person. Hopefully one day I find that for myself BUT just wanted to say your relationship is beautiful and I hope all is going well and continues to!
The gym is awesome! Sending love to both of you!
Awesome job on the new project. Respect for opening up and telling your side on how you're doing. Sending you as well lots of love and strength. You are doing and awesome job with being there for Bec and I'm sure youre making her stronger and happier through this tough time.
It is beautiful!! Love you both. Praying for you B💖💖💖
It looks amazing! Great job, Eamon!  Sending you good energy!
so so happy to see you both doing so well! <3
❤️🇿🇦💕
Osso really loves that couch lol love you both so much and think about y'all a lot! Positive thoughts your way always
Damn I’m so impressed by you guys, all you do turns out amazing and it will be the same outcome for Bec’s healing 🙏💛 beautiful energy !!
Fellow Canadian here! I just wanted to say you guys are so strong and amazing because your so inspiring and emon you are incredible and a amazing person!
Oh my God! When Oso jumped on that couch, it broke my heart! Sending you all lots of love and healing from the Adirondack foothills! <3
I truly missed Bec's giggles
Sending love and good wishes your way every day! ❤️

I've missed you two.  Thanks for the update.  The room looks FAB and I am so happy to hear Bec is half way thru chemo and up and around.  Thank you for your comments, Eamon.  My thoughts are with you both and we are all pulling for you!
i wish athletic greens is available in Egypt

I’m always thinking of you too, such a beautiful and warm couple. Bec you have an amazing man, Eamon your such a strong partner. I can’t even explain how cute you guys are. I can always feel the love in the videos. Bec you look amazing, so excited that your doing better and you felt amazing that day☀️✨🌻🌼💕

OMG your dog needs his own show! What a riot he is. Energy and love to you all.
17:52 I’m crying. ❤️
🎤
im happy and im crying for this episode , hi from selangor, Malaysia  🥹🥹🥹 ... ive been watching your youtube videos for almost 4 years ..
Thank you for your update guys as I truly appreciate all you going through; Eamonn opening up isn't easy yet we are here for you as well as Bec.  I wished my husband at the time was supportive to me in chemotherapy & radiotherapy nstead of committing adultery. I really don't think I can every get over it. You guys are truly beautiful and I love watching your builds.  I equally ❤ your dog - he is ACE.  Godbless you both & your family. Namaste 🙏🌴🌾☀️😎❤
The porch looks AMAZING!! Well done! 🎉
Hope things are going well
You guys are just awesome!
You both are so inspiring 💛 you both truly blow me away with your spirits and authenticity. It would be a dream to meet you both some day, y’all are seriously lights in this world and I always look forward to another video💛
Love the new room, bear didn’t want to see the couch leave was too cute to watch.  When I was a caregiver for my husband all the memories came back when you said how you were feeling, I would do it all over again if I could.  You two are going to come through stronger than ever.  Also take care of you, keeping busy is good, you are her rock and it shows.
Oso was so attached to that Sofa and he didn't want it to go, Becks you are as beautiful as ever and it was great to see your smile and good that you felt well enough to help Eamon. I am praying for your recovery, Eamon I understand what you are going through, you keep yourself busy because when you sit around you have too much time to think about what Becks is going through, You are an incredible guy and you are so supportive with Becks. the Entry room looks amazing well done
I ‘am so happy ! you guys are back and doing good.  Love you  guys.  😘  Praying for you.
Do you guys have an address that we can send cards or something to you guys?
Thank you two so much for everything. Thank you thank you thank you!
01:42 😂😂😂😂😂
What a couple. Eamon is a man’s man. Taking care of his lady while she is having challenges. Putting positive energy into the world. Building a gym out of a beat up space. Wow! Bec is a model for how to face an illness. I am much older than you guys but I’m humbled by your wisdom and grace. If you are ever in San Diego… anything you need! Excellent cooking a great place to stay, a tour guide.
Bec is so pretty :)
So much love. Eamon it’s ok to feel all the emotions even the negative let them in ride them through then come back to the good. You guys are amazing. The sunshine is coming.
Appreciate the transparency through all this and showing the ups and downs. Staying strong for someone else can be so tough at times.
thank you for the update!! I think about you guys everyday, I'm so happy to see you both creating and keeping the positive energy up. Sending unconditional love your way always <3
Eamon wow,wow, wooow! AMAZING JOB , I LOVE that room, you're so talented.  Poor Oso, he really didn't want that couch to go 😄.  Thank you for sharing your emotions about Bec's situation, it all be over soon! I pray for you guys every night.  Bec you look great! Can't wait for your next video! Won't get tired of saying it: you guys are amazing!
Totally love you two!  Hang in there!  We want you two to be around for a long long long long time!! 🙏💖💙. Love this vlog!!  You two can and will do this!!! 💙💖🙏. PS Oso is hilarious…need more camera from Oso’s perspective!!
Love you Eamon, thank you for share, you don't owe us anything. "You can't control things to happen, just the way you react to them" everybody has different ways to manage difficult situations, you are doing what you can, don't be so hard on your self, you deserve to feel,to be scared,to be vulnerable. You are doing amazing thank you for sharing. For Bec, you look amazing even not having energy you are smiling and giving your love to your loved ones. For both of you guys and your family a HUGE HUG and good vibes, love you. And thank you for sharing, by the way amazing job with the coloring BEC and the gym too Eamon.
Soo good to see you guys!  Glad for the update.  Been checking daily to see you guys.  Continue praying for both of you.  Made my day hearing from you.  Your project is coming along great.  Sending you love.
So glad to see this video! I was beginning to worry about Bec not doing well, but this video gave me peace of mind! She’s so strong and inspirational ♥️
I was just thinking about you guys a few days ago. Praying for your both! Room looks awesome!
i pray for you both all the time. you owe us nothing eamon. you just keep doing you and being you for Bec. we love you guys more than you know!!
oh eamon,, 4300 comments you might not get to mine. Im so sorry for you. if i could i would make her stop right now,, just stop, chemo kills that is very clear just look at her,, it makes me cry too. she is very frail and good reason chemo kills as i stated. all she needs is baking soda 3 times a day very simple cure. doesn't cost anything which is why is it suppressed,, cant pay for a porsche right prescribing baking soda. i wonder too if bec thinks the big boobs at the end if she makes it is what she really wants or needs. they remove the nipples,, she wont have nipples she wont be able to breast feed never mind her connection with you right. women have nipples for a reason it is a big part of the connection to you. for cripes sake eamon its only half way and look at the result. modern medicine is all satanic bs. if you understand what is happening in the world you would realize that what is happening to bec is literally a satanic ritual of suffering. eamon you need to pray and call it whatever you want : source ,, GOD.. creator,, grandfathers,,, doesnt matter but you need to call on the higher power to help bec. to help her understand she is literally killing herself. do it eamon and do it now.
I am so Proud to be a follower of the Two + of you.  Osso is So Sweet - he certainly loved "his" couch!!! You are Both so Strong, I know, we All have our moments, but to pick up and carry on means that you Both are incredibly strong! My prayers for continued strength and healing. 💞🙏🏽
Thank you so much for sharing your feeling Eamon! I’m sure I’m not the only one in saying this but I am so proud of you for staying strong and finding some sense of normalcy in your day to day! It was so great to see the glowing smile on both of your faces this week. Remember this is but a fleeting moment in your life. A moment you/we will look back on and reflect on how strong it made you! Sending healing thoughts ❤️  P.S. the room looks amazing! Can’t wait to see it being put to use! I noticed there’s more plants around the cabin. Such a welcoming and healing place!
Bec has an amazing shaped head, really beautiful girl, I wanted to know if Bec is fasting before Chemo? Fasting allows the cells in the body to protect themselves by creating a protective layer around themselves. Chemo will only attack and remove the cancer cells as they do not have the ability to create a layer for protection. fasting for 2-3 days before chemo is the right amount of time for the cells in the body.
This video brought out all of the emotions in the best way possible ❤️ sending so much love to you both!
Forgot to ask if you are fostering your GORGEOUS dog or if he's for keeps?
❤️
So thrilled to see this update! Have missed you two, while fully understanding the reason for the gap between videos. You've been so much on my mind and in my prayers.
Truly amazing how you're tackling this stage in your lives on so many levels! Continuing to send you both positive vibes and healing thoughts.
So glad you guys found the sweetest dog to snuggle with while you’re not feeling well 🐶🥰
You two ROCK !!! Wow Amazing people and fellow Canadians !🇨🇦❤️
💪💪💪💪💪💪🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I'm in love with Oso! He made my day!
Jeeez, you guys just continue to amaze us!! What an episode, I am absolutely flabbergasted by your creativity, your positivity, your joy and take on everything in life. And so on… a s o…. This one, in every moment, just breathes pure LOVE throughout! ❤️ What a space you created 🙀🤩 Fanfreakingtastic!!!! 👌👌👌 I have to say this is my favourite so far. But then again, I have said that a lot since you found your own haven on earth 🥰 Lots of love to you all from me and the dogs in Sweden ✌️🇸🇪 💕
God bless you both ❤
I have not laughed so hard as I did with Oso jumping up on the couch.
Thank you for sharing your lives and tribulations with us.  Osso is a definite highlight for me.  So glad you found each other.  The new room looks AMAZING!  Makes me want to work out - and that's saying something.
GO SPURS GO!!!! That's awesome to see a Team all the way from TEXAS on your video!!! Much Love and Prayers :)
Praying for your whole family… great to see all of the support for Bec… you got this guys!!!
"Bits and bobs" - been watching the Indie Projects? Great work.
Looks amazing!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
He's all like "You are not taking my couch!! Please dont take my couch!! Im going with it!!!" And then in his bed "I miss my couch!!"
Love spending my Sunday's with you and your families! Keeping you all in my thoughts! You are such an inspiration!
❤❤❤❤❤❤💞💞💞💞❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🐕🐶🐶💞💞🐶🐶
I just watched this video second time. 2 of you are such an inspiration. And OS is absolutely hilarious.
Wow!
Great as always <3 You are such an example  to follow (sometimes xD )
Love Eamon’s Energy, Get well soon Bec ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ lot’s of love from across the ocean 🇿🇦
Amazing job
Back is rocking the no hair look!!! Your beautiful babe!! Respect for the honesty eamon. Your human too!
I clicked on this video SO FAST. You can see Bec becoming stronger each day and it’s amazing to see, what an incredible woman and amazing inspiration to younger women! And a massive well done to you Eamon for being so open and honest. I’m so happy to see you both again. 🥰❤️ Also, Oso is definitely your Angel dog, bringing you fun and laughter in the difficult times. 😁❤️
Go Spurs Go!
Praying for you & Bec in this difficult time. I’ve had some serious health problems similar to what you’re going through and I know how scary and difficult this is. I just wanted to share Jesus with you both and tell you that there is eternal life in Christ. If you repent of your sins and believe that Jesus died for you, He promises eternal life. I’m just sharing because I love you guys and it’s the most important thing to know where you’re going to go after this life.
Sending you both love, strength, and laughter 💕. Eamon you tore at my heartstrings when you were speaking about your journey with Bec.  You guys are meant to be ♥️. Looking forward to your next vlog!
the renovation looks so sickkkk!! good job dude! you should put up some speakers for workout jams \m/
Seeing Oso loving on Bec and then resting his head on her foot 🥺🥰 he is precious! The space turned out amazing.
Oso is an absolute gem! So happy he made his way to you and Bec 🥰
A body suit by Suitical is dramatically more comfortable and manageable than the cone.  Our 42 pound dog was spayed a couple of weeks ago and the suit worked great and she left it alone.  You just snap the back end up when the dog needs to do their business. (I have no financial interest in Suitical)

Looks amazing!!! Sending lots of love to you both ♥️♥️♥️🙌🏼
Eamon, you and Bec are being really strong about this. Love from the UK 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Здравствуйте дорогие Эймон и Бек :) Я из России Иркутской области :) Хочу вам сказать не открывайте свое сердце ,беде которая постучалась к вам в дверь . Вы большие молодцы и я верю в вас :) Мой муж говорит ,опухоль боится больших температур, и предлагает если у вас есть возможность в течение недели ходить в русскую баню (сауну) и по 20-40 минут находиться там при температуре 70-90 °С, при этом необходимо применять пихтовую смолу в качестве эфирного ароматического масла, говорит это должно помочь. Пихтовая масло нужно использовать потому что она обладает антисептическим свойством .Конечно заранее можете проконсультироваться с врачом. Ребята все будет у вас хорошо, главное думайте позитивно:)
God bless everybody:)   hugs:)
Looks amazing. Great job.
Beautiful job!!! We love you Eamon! Thank you for being vulnerable. Praying for both of you! 🥰💕
You both are so awesome! Bec I love your strength and positivity. Eamon I love how good you take care of your wife through all this. You are strong also. It can't be easy watching your love go through all that. You two are goals in so many ways. Thanks to you both for taking us along. I know it can't be easy to record those bad moments. ❤🙏💯
Eamon, let you emotions run. Be honest with yourself. Hug Bec for me. We have been praying for you.
Osho is so hilarious...he's the best! Room looks amazing (you should add some comfy chairs) and it's good to see Bec up and about! XXOO
Awwww Oso 🤣
Looks amazing! This is literally my aesthetic, so definitely adding it to my "dream home" plan :P
Great job Eamon. Doesn’t it feel good when you have normal days in between the Chemo, Becs 😁 Just keep feeling positive you will get there 🤗
You both are so brave and so strong! It’s good to see how much love and support you guys have 🥺
Also a fellow Canadian. I'm so glad you posted a video! I was worried something bad had happened, but I didn't want to be intrusive as after all I don't know you and I am a random person on the internet. I have been thinking about you two a lot as I also found a lump in a breast at just over 30 (many years ago). Thankfully for me it was just a fatty lump, but scary up until we got the results of the biopsy. The room looks fantastic and what a beautiful space to practice yoga in! Being surrounded by nature is the best therapy!
Ur dowing grate dude and she will be fine. Stay strong!
You two are such beautiful people inside & out. The love you have for one another is amazing. Sending you both virtual hugs & prayers. Becs i am in awe of your beauty,  after everything you are going through & you still manage to look incredible. 🥰 love from England xx
so proud of you, Bec! you're doing so good bud!
So much beauty in this video…sending you all the love, light and strength❤️
Eamon, you’re amazing! In my prayers for Bec you are of course included as being a support person is incredibly difficult and having to be strong for your person. You both are beautiful people and are so strong together!
Great job on the workout room! You are both rock stars! Much love!
It’s ok The Lord got her and you we can’t control everything so let go and trust in the Lord with this process it’s y’all story to heal somebody God Blessed you both 🙏🏾❤️❤️👑👑😘
Praying for both of you!!!
<3<3<3<3<3
So much love to you both! Beautiful renovation, as always. 🤍
The new gym is AMAZING.  I laughed SO HARD I cried at all of your dog's "Cone of Shame" mishaps.  Happy to see Bec smiling.  Thoughts and good vibes are being sent your way from Minnesota!!!
Eamon, that room came out amazing. Oso with the couch was hilarious!  I’m glad to see Bec up and eating. Completing chemo party needed! 🎉
I applaud your honesty and showing your vulnerability Eamon. So good to see you guys again! You both look great, keep it up, you can do it!❤❤❤❤❤
Love you guys so much!! So happy to see a drill in Becs hands for even a minute. I hope that becomes your sanctuary for healing, you guys are so inspirational. Sending all my love and good vibes your way!

Hey Eamon and Bec, sending you loads of love. Eamon, you're doing such a good job in taking care of Bec and yourself. It's incredibly inspiring to see how you are dealing with Becs sickness, and how honest you are with yourself and us throughout this journey. Please, make sure to take all the support you need and reach out! Bec, your optimism is uplifting and I am so in awe by you and how you are embracing your body and your emotions. I sincerely wish I could give you two a hug. You're incredible beings. Lots of love & light

Just started watching your channel. I want to say that I am so sorry to see what y’all are going through. I just added y’all to my intercessory prayer list, where you will stay. Once I add someone, they never come off. May God bless y’all and keep you in His loving care.🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
As I sit here in Bristol England crying eating my vegan burger catching up with two amazing people that I've never met but truly respect whole heartedly I must share that my daughter said as she walked in with burger all over her face WOW Mummy he's clever followed by that lady is really pretty! Out of the mouths of babes.....you are both just awesome. Thank you ! I'm sending you so much love. You wonderful peeps!
You are amazing Bec, we admire your courage in the storm, it will past, rest assured it will past.
Wow, your exercise room turned out so welcoming, functional and beautiful. Great job you guys.
Well done for sharing you are amazing by being honest keep letting go giving the situation to God, He is your comfort in a time of trouble.
The partial wall at the entry was a game changer.  Made the space so functional.  Beautiful space. Great job guys!
Looks Amazing! Great job 👏 Bear is the bestest dog ever ❤
Thinking of you guys. Great job. Gym Looks amazing. I find myself always trying to check in on your channel and see how y’all are doing. Bec can’t wait until you are back to your healthy self. Eamon you’re an awesome husband. Wishing you both healing blessings.

Sending you my thoughts and prayers. You both are so incredibly strong. I feel so blessed that you, Bec and Oso are sharing your lives with us, the ups and the downs. Love the porch!!!
Hey man. Fellow dude here. I just wanted to thank you for opening up and being willing to share how you really feel about seeing Bec change like this. I can only imagine how hard it is to go through this and I just wanna let you know that I love you, brother! If you ever wanna reach out and talk to someone and have some support, I'm here and I won't judge you at all.
Great job on porch. Bec looks great. Keep it up. Just prayed for you. Yep, I'm a praying lady.
Oso was the star of this vid! Love that dude soo much!!
The gym looks great! I have been following your journey for quite some time and although I seldom comment, I wanted to let you know you and your families are in my thoughts and nightly God blesses! Stay strong for each other!
It's beautiful guys. You did a great job.
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Here for you everyday. Sending sunshine
Oso is such a good dog LOL
What a great start to your video!  Happy tears with OSO losing his throne, so glad you are back.
Love you guys ❤️
LOVE IT! The vibe of the wood and the white paint mixed. Great idea to have the big open space and solves the entry way and weight room all at once. Looks like such a great place to soak in the views of the lake. Just windows, windows windows!
Poor Osso….
Hello eamon and beck, i love your videos, your story… and thank tou for aharing. Dont wory bith of you will be  good. Ok. I will say your name in my prayer too. Stay strong. Liv u guys
I color to Bec. It's great for passing time when you don't feel well.
I’m sure there would be many in the community who’d love to add you on Peloton. I know I would. My leaderboard name is AugustEric. I’ve got somewhere between 500 and 600 rides. It’s addicting. It’s a great workout, especially if you are a competitive type.
Love it SO much
Wow! The new room/entrance looks amazing!  Loved getting to see/hear from you two again. Love you both so much! You both are in my thoughts & prayers.
You're freaking amazing Eamon.  We're holding Bec up in our hearts and minds.
The dog was hysterical.
So glad you guys are doing well!
Keep you guys in my prayers.
The new room looks amazing!  Have you considered using the loft for a meditation space?  That way you could have a true body, mind and soul space! ❤️
Great work on the porch / gym  Best wishes and love from Ireland
Eamon, I cried with you! You are the absolute best partner and we are all her supporting you!
Great job on the room. Bec you look great … keep fighting the fight! OMG … I died laughing at the dog and the couch 😂
Hi from Arizona! What a team you guys are. Bec, I've been praying and thinking of you so much. Good to see your smiling face. Eamon, thinking about you too. If something happens to our spouse, it happens to you too. Bravo man!!! You are an outstanding "Buddy" to Bec. Love is an amazing thing. Great job on the room! It's beautiful! Hang in there both of you. Must be amazing to know thousands of your peeps are supporting you! P.S. couldn't stop laughing at Oso trying to keep the couch! OMG!!! 👏💗
Love you guys and miss you when your gone but we all understand the time is needed ♥️ Bec is gorgeous as ever 🥰 Curious what kind of skillet that is you used to make the vegan crispy tortilla things .. 😋
Um i cried 3 times. Love you guys so much!!!!! So proud of you
You both are amazing. Although times are tough you are so positive. Eamon, it’s okay to feel the emotions you feel.  Osso jumping on the couch… too funny.  You’re in my thoughts and prayers often. Stay strong. 💗💕💗
Bec you are so beautiful and humble what an incredible sweet heart you have!...Emon you are doing amazing...really strong of you to open up and show your vulnerability...so glad to see how much support you both have...am praying to Mother Mary for your healing and protection...she has done miracles in my life...the power of prayer is unsurpassable, thank you for sharing your life and all the wonderful videos.... love you x x x

Amazed by this project! Such an inspiration, both in the kind of people you are, and your masterful interior design eye. Sending you love from Washington DC!
What a healing haven for ALL of you!  Thank you Eamon for updating us on your cabin,  Beck and you.  I know too well how difficult it is for your "person" to be ill.  💞
Dear Eamon & Bec, I have been through tis as well. My girlfriend of 36 is battling with stomach cancer. It is so freakin' hard. Eamon, I do relate to your feelings of helplessness. BUT... Keep faith! In the end, Bec is strong and she will conquer this. For sure!
Hi from germany. You are such an amazing couple. Nothing´s ever gonna stop you, no matter what! Sending loads of love to you both. Stay strong! And let me just say: Bec you look amazing!!! <3 <3 <3
Sending you both so much love and light!
You guys are both awesome.  Much love to you both.
Any disease like this is humbling to the person and the caregivers and the people that they love. You hit it right on the nail Eamon, you lose control of the things that you think you had under control. And it’s very scary.  Good for to talk about it…that’s the best way to deal with it.  Much love and prayers for you and Bec and your friends and family that are gathering around you and traveling with you through this journey. ❤️🙏❤️
Id give my left butt cheek to have a dog like Oso 🥺
I was sooooo excited when I saw a video was out. I had been checking and checking just in case I had missed it. So glad Bec is doing well and Eamon I can’t imagine how tuff it is for you as well. Y’all are so inspiring!!!! Much love to you both!!!
lots of love to both of you. thank you to eamon for opening up. I don't think I've seen you this vulnerable in any of your previous videos no matter how difficult things got. that can't have been easy for you, I really appreciate it.
TIMMMMMMMMMM my main manssss
I'm a breast cancer survivor I know what the fight is like.  Stay strong.
Omggg my rabbit’s name is Oso 😍😍 I love that name so much! I think there was a true blessing that you all built a beautiful cabin in time for Bec’s diagnosis. I can’t imagine dealing with scrambling to find a comfortable and suitable living situation in the midst of serious health issues. The space looks really great!
The porch turned out so beautifully!! And Eamon your vlogs are wonderful. Sending both of you so much love and light 💕  I think about both of you all the time and it's so good to see you!
You guys!!!!! What a fantastic job!!! When is the housewarming party—I will bring some vegan burrito wraps air fried to perfection…..😁. Really-job well done! Bravo! Sending love 💕 to both of you.
Thanks Eamon for updating us on your journey.  Been thinking about how you are doing.  You're a control freak? Really? No! You did a beautiful job on the porch! So nice that both of your families are helping support the two of you. You guys rock. Take care and see you next time. Love to you both.
Eamon, there's support available for you too. If you need to chat with a professional, do it. You're going through what's called Living Grief, it's what we go through when someone close to us is going through something like Bec is! You're not alone and we all love you both. 💕
That room looks amazing! Great work as always! Hugs to you both! 💞
Just ordered my first AG!!! I am hopeful that it will help me with my Lupus and arthritis. Can’t wait! Thank you for your dedication to this product. 😘
Love this video, the room looks amazing. I've been praying for you guys. ❤
i love you  guys soo much, you guys are soo strong  and inspiring i wish you guys the best you guys are truly amazing people and Bec you are so beautiful!!
Excellent idea with the project. Focus on positive things (like improving the home) and occupy oneself. You guys are doers and Bec will be back in notime to full strength! Hang in there. Love and support from Germany!
You guys are so inspiring to watch!! I love you both times a million!  YOU GOT THIS BEC!!! & Eamon you are a god sent man!! Y'all are the definition of soul mates!
Eamon, hor feelings are so understandible. They are valid! Sending you strenght and love 💕
Beautiful
Just wanted to reach out to you both, I was diagnosed with cancer last November and without the love and support from my partner I have no idea how I would have coped with the challenges I (we) have had to face. So I wanted to tell Eamon It's good to express your emotions and speak about it even though its tuff, most people don't think of the impact this has on loved ones in your position, Stay strong
So happy to see you all, its been too long!   You're an inspiration to me.  I lost my husband in January,  it's so hard to watch the person you love most go through such pain,  but you are doing a fantastic job Eamon.  So proud of you Becs,  your strength is amazing, keep fighting.  Thoughts, prayers, best wishes and love to you all.  ❤️
Dude you need a nail gun.
Bec looks so much like her dad!
That room is beautiful. Sending continued good thoughts, prayers and love to you both.
The dog and the couch 😂😂😂 that is too cute n hilarious 😂
Looks amazing Eamon. Well done. Thinking of you both still during this thought time. Sending loads of healing love to you both.  ❤️‍🩹 Xx
❤️❤️❤️
I love both of you! I have been praying very hard for Bec! My sister had breast cancer and has been cancer free for the past 9 years. It can be beat. So much sending your way! ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Eamon, THANK YOU for allowing yourself to open up & be vulnerable & share your feelings....you and Bec have SO much love & support coming your way.  Keeping you in my thoughts & prayers.  ❤
You're doing a great job supporting bec eamon in everything you do, you and bec have a lot of love and support by so many people and I'm one of them sending healing love  xx
Hi guys.  beck you look wonderful and it’s so nice to see you. Your pictures that you coloured are beautiful and you may consider taking a picture each time you have chemo and hanging it on the wall in front of you to remind yourself of the beautiful things you have made. I think the visual of the magnificent things you have in your life with Eamon…Oslo, your beautiful home, talent, family, friends, community and oxygen from the trees around you. My dear I could go on for paragraphs but when your chemo session is over you can take it back home or leave it for the next person to look at and admire.  Eamon last but not least…wonderful job on the studio..healing room
I pray for you both all the time, I know its not much, but it is all I can do.  If I could give some of my strength to see Bec well I would so I ask God to.   God bless you both and love the new room.  Sending big hugs from UK
You're both doing great!
Eamon you’re an inspiring supportive partner, Bec super brave and positive, a great example to everybody out there!
Yup that dog is comedy central , you made a good editing choice to include him more in this video , bless u guys ! 💚✌😘
I’ve missed you guys! I watch your videos every single week and have done for years 🤍 your positive energy is infectious and I always watch your videos to cheer me up ☺️ also the scenery in Canada is AMAZING and I really hope to visit someday 👌 love you guys, wishing you both good health, healing and all the happiness you both so deserve 🤍🤍🤍
Oso and the couch will become a clasic, fell out of my chair laughing.  Then cried with you on your journey.  Hang in there we're all rooting for all of you!
My favorite friendly Canadian neighbors!! So great to see Bec up and at em and taking everything at her own pace. You guys are so motivating to watch!! Continuing to send you guys positive vibes <3
Love you two. Lots of luck for your recovery, Bec 💐
Wow, wow, wow! This vlog is a masterpiece 🙌  I laughed so much at Oso and the couch as well as the cone. Oso was the star of the show. I also cried for Eamon. Opening up and being vulnerable is hard and while you already had my love and support you blew me away. Sharing this will help other spouses in their journey of supporting their partner. We also got to see Tim, Bob, and Coach Adam! The project turned out amazing and the icing on the cake was seeing beautiful Bec feeling well enough to join in. So much love to the 3 of you. It was so good to see you 🥰
You are SO cute with you're little bald head Bec  ! I'm praying for health and a great healing for you dear. 🙏  God Bles🇺🇲
God l laugh out loud seeing the dog jumping on the couch , that dog is a unit but he's such a gentle giant ! 😂🐶💚
Bec, I love the fresh buzz! Lookin clean AF!!
You guys are so fun and I’m grateful you are sharing your life the way you do.  2 days ago I got the news that my cancer has returned and now Im back on this journey of living with cancer. I feel connected to you both as my husband is also on this journey just like you Eamon.  It helps to not feel so alone.  I’m praying for you both here from Tennessee.
John 3:16, ESV: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I was so glad to see an update, I was wondering how you and Bec had been doing the past few weeks.  You’ve been working so hard, Eamon, don’t forget to give yourself time to rest too. You can’t give water from a dry well.   xxxx
The weight cabinet looks so dope! When you guys got to vibin and dancing all I could do is smile. Glad to see you having a great day Bec!!!💪😁☺❤
Oh my god oso is brilliant he had me laughing the whole video
Hello! The porch is looking amazing! But add plants!! 🌿Can imagine a couple of little hanging plant baskets in the corner for the most ultimate sunset yoga zen-like haven 🥰🌅  also thank you for the update and for another brilliant video (can imagine picking up the camera and the whole editing process is not quite as easy at the moment), it's so so lovely to (kinda) hang out with you guys! You guys have been part of my life for about 4 or 5 years now and have inspired me so much to sieze the moment, enjoy life and also to convert my own van once I graduate! I didn't realise it until hearing about Lee how much you guys and your health and happiness meant to me, only then I realised your vlogs aren't just a weekly TV show that I enjoy but you guys are kinda my friends (that may sounds a little sad, but I have friends that do now my existence too I swear 😂). So anyways... Glad to catch up with you guys and too see you too rocking whatever life throws at you! ☺️ Also glad to see some familiar faces too (shout out to Bob - Big Bob love), sending love hugs and sunshine ☀️😁. Hannah x
Great video. Lovely to see you all xx
Thanks for opening up Eamon. I've been thinking about you through all of this, and hoping you've been taking care of yourself too.
Much love to the both of you
BEC THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BALD HEAD I’VE EVER SEEN!!!! YOU LOOK STUNNING!!!!! AND EAMON YOU’RE THE BEST HUSBAND ON THIS PLANET KEEP DOING WHAT YOU’RE DOING!!!!
It’s just as hard if not harder been the caregiving/ loved on of somebody sick just in a very different way while you may have your health it’s so so hard watching the person you love going through something so tough and been totally helpless. Remember to take time out for yourself too Eamon it’s just as important and it’s important to Bek too that you’re at your best and mentally healthy self of you need a time out make sure you take full advantage of that amazing supper network you guys have and go doing something you love for a day.   I am sending so much love a sunshine from Australia to you guys I think a lot of times the care giver is overlooked so while yes it’s very important everybody is there for support for Bek it’s just as important to show our support for Eamon.   You two are incredible!!!
YOUR VIDEOS IS WHAT GIVES ME LIFEEEEEEE I REALLY MISSED YOU GUYS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 YOUR IG STORIES ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR ME I NEED YOU VIDEOS FOR MY MENTAL HEALTH 😫
Eamon!!!  Just...thanks man!  So much love and so many hugs to you!  🌹
Sending you love
So happy to see you both back! Sending all my love ❤️
I am so glad to see you both again. I have been praying every day and night for Bec as well as you Eamon.  Eamon you are doing a great job being with Bec while she is going thru all of this. I can't express how I feel for you both. Take Care and God Bless
You owe us nothing Eamon but I thank and love you guys for your vulnerability❤ I pray continued strength for both of you guys. Bec and you are going look back soon and say we went through that and Boom we got through that! Hugs for you both from DC!
I’m always in amazement at how you look at a space and transform it beautifully. Much love from NH ❤️❤️
BUT IT'S MY COUCH!!!😆 So glad to see you both doing well, especially one lovely lady who is taking no poop. Stay strong and be kind to yourself.💯💗🙏🏽
NIce to see you two.
Welcome back guys!!!!!!! 💗
I'm so glad you both have Oso, the healing companionship of a dog is like no other! Sending lots of love to you all <3
The place looks amazing!!!  My daughter moved out last Tues so we're transforming her room into a gym soon, thanks for the ideas!  I'm so proud of both of you!  You're such an inspiration all the way around, sending love, hugs, and prayers to you both ❤️
Looking good Beck hopefully your getting good feedback from the doctors and looks like your happier than ever… Hang in there Ramon, your future will be great with Beck…
It's so great to see Bec up and about and to see how supportive you all are, especially you Eamon. All Canadians are behind you and thinking of both of you. Hugs and prayers.
So good to see You, I was worried. Luv ya <3
Room looks amazing. Very concerned about the balustrade in mini loft. It certainly wouldn’t pass inspection in Aust. and I checked Canadian code and I don’t think it qualifies either. Worth checking out.
The room looks fantastic!
So pleased to see Tim and enjoyed seeing pup’s love of the couch was so cute!! Great have so many family guest stars appearing as well!! Grateful to you both for providing positive model of how caregivers are mindful to stay mentally strong and healthy! And amazed at the humour and strength of Warrior Bec! I continue to toast you both with my morning AG1! Love to you both as you build your wellness paradise!
It looks amazing guys!
What about foam panels under the floor?
Can you please clone Bear!! I love him!
Hey fellow dog lover here when my brothers dog got neutered we put a pair of shorts on him when he was inside and put the cone on him just to let him go potty it works great they still can’t bite back there and they won’t knock stuff over in your house👍
guys!! stay strong 💪!! 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
beautiful work eamon... i think about you guys so much, and i don't even know you.. all good thoughts and you guys will come out of this SO strong.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Wow that looks amazing! Great job 👍
Good intentions your way guys! YOU GUYS GOT THIS!!!
He did not want to let that couch go! Eamon I could completely relate to what you were saying as in a way to a much less degree as you I feel the same. I still can’t believe this is happening to Bec. You have done a great job, you have both made such a lovely home.  It was also heartwarming to see how much support you are getting from your families and friends.  You are both surrounded by love and rightly so! Sending you both positive vibes   💕
Praying for you two. Did you get permits this time? So glad to see you two!
❤️😘
That room looks amazing!  You two rock!  xxx
Words cannot describe how happy I was to see this notification! Everytime I tune in I’m reminded why I have been a devoted fan for 2 years 🤍 I loved seeing Bob and Tim, as well as Becs parents! It’s beautiful to see how resilient and strong you are for Bec, Eamon and the love you two guys share is inspiring! Whenever I want to be in a productive, happy mood I always put on one of your build series. Bec, you are beautiful, so strong and the positivity you exude is absolutely heart warming! So happy to see you make it half way through treatment with such grace, while doing what you need to do at your own pace💛 and Oso… I am so happy you have found your forever home with such wonderful, kind and loving humans🐾
Thanks for sharing Eamon and thanks for the update guys! Positive healing vibes from Australia with lots of love.
Stay strong Bec 💪🏻😍💕 Eamon you can do this and don't give up keep praying and everything will be alright
I wonder if the previous owners have seen the cabin? It looks like a totally different place. Amazing work
Thank you for the update, so good to see you moving forward,  one step at a time.  Sending  positive thoughts and energy 🙏🏻

It's the fall collection. Of Dior. LMAO.
Beautiful reno!   Eamon, you are doing all the right things…supporting Bec through her ordeal.  You also are living your own ordeal.  Keep talking to someone. Your feelings are valid and you too need support.  We continue to pray for healing for Bec and strength for you.  Hang in there.  ❤️
In my prayers!
Yay!  Just Yay!  Fight fiercely!
Bec’s dad reminds me of Steve Martin in the best way
Love you guys ❤️ always thinking of you both. You’re such beautiful souls ❤️ hang in there ❤️

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I want to send some love to you guys. This is not an easy journey to go through. It's a good idea to keep busy, but also take time to reflect and let your feelings out so you don't bottle up for the both of you. Bec might be doing all the treatments, but Eamon, you are going through a different and difficult journey as well. Thank you for sharing briefly how you are doing. The new updates to the cabin look great. You did a lovely job. I wish you both well and send healing thoughts.
Missed you Guy's! Always Thinking and Praying for you Bec ❤️  Eamon you are The Man, Keep your Head up Bro! Wishing you both and Oso alot of warm Hugs from Melbourne Australia.
I love that your project involved the whole family. Looks great.
I took my dogs cone off her head one or two days after her operation as she didn't seem interested in licking the wound. And I was right. A waste of money, the stupid cone!
Love this and wonderful to see you both creating and sharing your offerings with us. Love to you both xxx
What a joy!! Bless you for the long video! The space is beyond incredible. Bec, you look SO beautiful! You are incredible videographers!! Oso and the couch was so nuts (in the best of ways.) What I saw in both of you was incredible balance. Such grace and dignity. There's no way not to love you both. You remain in my prayers. <3
bec you are looking as gorgeous as always <3 and i wish you a full complete recovery <3 much love from Australia <3
Oh gosh...so amazing! I'd been thinking about you all... Wondering how things were going. So happy to see your lovely faces. And as always...sending prayers of healing, strength and comfort. Give Bear a scritchy scratch from his New Orleans fan. ❤️🙏❣️
Eamon your amazing, so good to see bec is doing so well. Positive thoughts and healing prayers. Stay safe.
Love it! And thanks for opening up Eamon 😍😍🙏🙏
What a funny dog. Do not separate  a dog from his couch!! Blessings to you  and Bec. Praying for both of you.
Sending Love and Prayers. God Bless you both. 🙏🙏🙏💖💖💖
Oh wow! It feels like I’ve been waiting for this video for forever……. And it didn’t disappoint. Just loved you guys trying to take the couch. I was laughing out loud. I thought it was only cats that did this sort of thing. Eamon, you have the best attitude to coping with your stress….keep busy. Doing well man! And Bec, looking lovely. You must be so proud of yourself for getting through this. Keep on hanging in there. Much love from Australia xx
OSO needs his own channel. He’s hilarious 😂
Love you guys with my whole heart
You both are doing soooo great! Thansk for sharing this.. And I am sending all the positive energy  I have...
Beautiful room make over. I would love working out there. Simply gorgeous.  Well done Eamon, Bec & all the other family members that helped make this room come together.  You should be very proud of yourselves.   I hope you all continue to stay strong & stay positive during these really challenging heath struggles. You have all of our support from all over the world. Prayers for continued love, strength,  peace & happiness to you both.   Jen from Michigan
Love you both and are so glad to see you back!!
I've missed you guys... I literally visit your channel everyday to check if there's an update..
i dont think you owe anyone anything but its nice to see an update so we know yall are ok i really hope things get better and great job renovating that room
Only would like to say: lots of love and strenght to both of you. I’m glad to see spirits are still high even though you’re going through a rough path, lots of love all the way from The Netherlands 🇳🇱
So happy to see your beautiful face this Morning Bec! Praying for your speedy recovery from Portugal! 🙏🏼 you look great! You’ve got this! Almost on the home stretch!  Eamon, your such a wonderful support for Bec. Thanks for being real and vulnerable. It brought tears to my eyes seeing the raw love you have for Bec. You all did a great job on the fitness room! The entire house looks fantastic!❤️🙏🏼
Thanks for sharing how you’re doing. I just want to clarify that you don’t owe us anything. If you don’t feel like you should/can share how you’re doing, please don’t feel like you have to anyways. Your situation is something I would have to idea how to handle and some things that are private should stay private imo.
Aims and Rebs, (sorry, I’m an Aussie albeit a NY-based one, and we give everyone a nickname) I don’t read the comments and rarely comment myself so forgive me if this has been said already but Aims, why don’t you join Reb’s Chemo-journey by shaving your head too? You’re an amazing partner and awesome support and I salute you, both of you, but maybe if you give your dome a polish it’ll (a) give you guys (and us all) a laugh, and (b) be a tangible public gesture of support for your beautiful, powerhouse of a woman. You’re a good looking bloke so you’ll look fine. And Rebs, you totally rock both short hair and bald - I’m soooo jaloux! Pixie cut or crew cut for you when you’re on the other side of this, girl. Oh, and BTW, I love you both, love your work and luuuurv Oso (and Timmy, great to see him again although thankfully not in yoga pants). I’m thinking of you and your families and sending you love and healing; you got this, both of you; the other side of this ordeal you will be soaring, so stay the course, hold the line and bash on regardless (poor old regardless). Gx
Eamon, you are super strong. I know it's the worst feeling to see a loved one struggling and battling and you can't do anything about it except from being patient, there and trying not to get crazy. Everytime i see you two, i admire your strong relationship especially in those tough times. It shows your love for each other is super strong. Keep your heads up you two, much love from germany! 💜
Love you Buddies
Lol use zip ties to put it back together. That’s what worked for my dog… he kept breaking it but with a drill and some zip ties all was good
We are two years further down the shit’y cancer road, I feel for both of you! it does make the sun that bit brighter that bit warmer after the dark nights? ❤️
So great to see you Bec and fantastic job Eamon. Sending light and love your way. Oso and that couch were priceless. ❤
He’s like nopee you’re NOT taking MY couch 😂
Dude you made me leak.  We got you man.  God will not give more than we can not handle.  You both have it hard but you’re handling so positive and upbeat.  You’re an example of forward thinking wins the race.  All of it will be a thing of the past soon.  Also, find something to remove the rail under door .  In raining season without that piece you can have major water damage with the guard u removed.
Yor dog is so funny 😂😂😂
Wow - you two are always so inspirational. Fantastic video once again. So lovely to see you both and the support of family and friends helping you with the build. Oso - What a star. Laughing so hard when he was jumping on the couch. Love to you both from Canberra Australia xx
Love and hugs from Poland!
BEST room yet! Well done, guys! And Oso is just hilarious, no wonder you kept him!! :) Sending love and light x
Hello Bec  lovely to see you today on the new gym vlog.  Great job. Best wishes Geraldine  England    xx
U guys are so motivating. Your videos are the first thing I look forward to on sundays. Ps I love you bec.
If anyone love travel and adventure like Eamon and Bec, CHECK😉
It was so good to hear from you this Sunday! ☀️ I’m rooting for you….both!
WE LOVE U GUYS😙we hope a day we can travel with togeter, LOVE from IRAN❤❤
Sending you love.
Eamon and Bec and Oso you guys are the absolute best !!!  Oso loves you so so so much its beautiful to see x
makes me so sad to see bec sad that she can’t do things she normally could
How funny, he loves the couch 💜💜💜
Love ❤️
Amazing job guys!
hugs and love from OZ.
You have made that home so beautiful ! And osso sure does fit with you two.  Keep busy keep Positive. Bec will be over this soon. Shes a strong  women
great to see you both again ❤️ Wonderful job on the porch Eamon!  Bec you look beautiful! Love that Osa, he is hilarious! love and healing to you both! ❤️
Wow! What an amazing job you guys did on that room. We’re thinking of you while you’re going through your treatments. 💕
I love the gym! The whole house is beautiful. And Bec you look so cute without hair! I'll continue to pray for you. I know you'll get better. This is just another challenge that the two of you will make it through together. Just keep focusing on how blessed you are to have each other and to have a such a nice home and that you are living your dream life together. I know what illness can do.  I have more than one chronic illness. Bec you hang in there. I read that olive oil helps fight cancer. You can research it and ask your doctor what he thinks but I thought I would pass the info on. You never know what may help. Anyway I just want you to know that it's ok to not feel ok. Some days you'll feel 100% and others you'll feel like you have zero energy. It's frustrating but you will get better. I believe that. Lots of love to you both!!!
Aemon, you are doing really great. And your resilient side is the sign that you are deeply in love with bac bend. Bac, lots of strength during the cure and after. it's nice to see you again. And the workout room looks great.
Amazing work! Love how you guys always keep it real💛 Sending love x
Eamon, thank you for sharing this amazing project.  Great to see how both you and Orso got your ‘teeth’ stuck into it.  The strength you and Bec show is truly inspirational, and by your strength I mean the vulnerability you shared so honestly.  Skills of self-awareness and building T&G - Bec is one lucky girl.  Lots of love from the UK xx
You two inspire me. 💕
Wow, what an incredible job! Just beautiful, and such an imagination! I would never have thought to make that room look like that. And really, the whole house now is just amazing. What a great environment to live in.
This might be one of my favourite rooms x
Great video, sending lots of love to you both.xx
Place looks awesome and so good to see you Bec.  Looking forward to see you feeling even better than before!
Okay, soooo, I just have to say that Oso is darn adorable!! He loves his couch! I was crying because I was laughing so hard at him jumping up onto the couch!
dont gry on gamera that make him feel more sad if she sees it.. just tell him in face
So so proud of you guys!! You are both amazing! And I ADORE BEAR!! I hope you have officially adopted him! He’s perfect for you guys! Love you all! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ can’t wait for more updates! Sending prayers!!!!
AZ https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
Sending love and every good wish from New Zealand. The love you have for each other is always inspiring.
All my love to bec and Eamon!❤️ Don’t stop fighting Bec!❤️ Really beautiful transformation ❤️
Oso looks so unimpressed all the time :D I just LOVE his face! He really looks like a boss who secretly loves and appreciates you but doesn't really want to show it hahahah. And Eamon, thank you for telling how you really feel. You are so awesome in so many ways. What a gem Bec has! Two actually. You and Oso
Sweet job on the entrance way. I'm very impressed!!
loads of love <3
Your both inspirational ❤️
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡

Eamo and Bec u r such an inspiration couple in sooooo many ways!!! It was lots of fun seeing all the extra helpers u got helping u, knowing very well they were not just there to help with the build💞. Eamon thanks so much for opening up, your words gave a lot of strength to others going through those kind of emotions, but that can't put it into words. U have no idea how much good u guys r doing in this world for others with your videos. Hang in there and keep being positive and spreading it around the world 💜💜💜💜
“Pleeeeeeease don’t take my couch…..” 😂
Way too many ads. Not watching
BEC AND EAMON, U ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
What breed of dog is Oso?
Eamon's VLOG, "Picasso I Like It"
So proud of you, guyz! You both are so strong, positive and a great team! Sending lots of love to you both!
You two are absolutely amazing. You are both an inspiration and I love following you on your journey. Bec you are an incredible young woman and I can't wait for you to be on the upside of treatment and on your way to getting back to your wonderful life you have built with Eamon. Eamon you are doing an amazing job of keeping your home and your beautiful Bec beautiful. Love from way down under in Tasmania Australia.
I did go through cancer and the road to chemo. You stay strong and accept the road to recovery. One day at the time and be grateful of the days ahead Take good care  Linda
So inspiring, the both of you, thanks for sharing Eamon
Watching from France! Amazing job Eamon! Sending you two love❤️  Love my sunday nights when I also have videos from kara and Nate and kinging it!
Beck, you are a beautiful angel :) Stay strong ! Im sending lots of love and positive energy towards you ! :):):) Edit: You too Eamon ! :D
I've been looking out each Sunday for your video, thank you both so much ... You definitely didn't disappoint.  Eamon just want to say take it easy on yourself, I understand completely what you're going through but the secret is you need to take care of Eamon 1st before you can take care of Bec or else you'll set yourself up for a fail if your don't keep yourself in the right mindset and stay busy. And Bec, you look absolutely stunning, keep fighting the good fight and I've got to say not too many people can pull off that hair free doo but you've done it... I'm so excited what the regrowth is going to look like. You're both so real, and reach into all of our hearts. Cheers to you both from the Wine Country in California with so much love. You got this! ♥️👏♥️
Eamon, stay strong!  Much love and positivity to you guys! 💪🙏💛
Sending much love from Aus..🇦🇺
So glad you are half way done with your treatments.  I must admit you Handsome dog was the star today.   Love your new sun/work out room.  enjoy
We love you guys!!! Loved this video…it was tender and raw and beautiful and Oso is hilarious!
Guys, have you thought about the chemicals released from the cabin renovation as the reason of Bec’s condition?.
Looks awesome! Love how you partitioned it with the weight storage wall. Very nice eastheitically too.  Well done.
So wonderful to see your tribe of people coming together to make things happen and show support. I actually think silence is very important , healing,and comforting in times of stress and anxiety. Allow yourself grace and quiet. Wishing you all positive times coming your way. I so admire your strength Bec. You are very inspiring.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great to hear from you guys.  Eamon, Bec will handle it as long as you do.  Secret formula: do it one day at a time--or one hour at a time, if needed.  Just ask yourself what is needed for the next day/hour? Then do it.  Repeat.  All good wishes to you both.
It's great to c u two. room looks great, so good to c becs smiling and eamond your be rock well done man
Love 💕 you two . Think about how your doing very often . Pray for you too .
❤
Love yeah eamon and bec always 💕💪🤗
God Bless
💜🌹💜
I am so happy to see you both!! I know its a challenging time for you but what an inspiration you have been with positive and loving video. Its day to day as far as emotions go when dealing with chemo, changes that go with that so ALL feelings are valid. Getting love and support from your families and each other is exactly the answer to getting through. Many prayers to you Bec for complete healing. The room looks so great!! Totally impressed with how talented you are Eamon.
You have done an incredible job. I love you both!🤗
I was so happy to see a new vid, even though I wasn’t expecting one. Beautiful transformation on the room Eamon. Thank you for sharing yourself. Sending love & healing prayers to you both from Penticton, BC.
Oso and his couch😂❤️
‘Kudos’ Eamon for being so ‘courageous’ to be able to open up & share the challenges you have faced during Bec’s health process.
I think Ohso looks like an Anatolian Shepherd. I know he is Pure Bred Good Boy actually 😂.  Sending healing for Bec and love to you all. 💕💕
Wow 😍 Eamon just keep up ur doing great 💖 Bec’s got it all ☺️💖 ur halfway there bec keep it up, we love you sunshine 🌞 See ya sunday 🤘🏻❤️
Très jolie réfection Eamon. Bec cela fait plaisir de te voir. Guéris vite afin de retrouver ton énergie d’avant. Mais tu as le moral. Bravo gros bisous de France 🇫🇷.👍😘
wow, just sending so much love to you and both your families. XXX
I’m going to keep it simple and sweet, myself as a fan of your channel and content can honestly say that I truly send my love to you both, I will continue with the prayers for you both. Sending lots of love and prayers, take care.
Oso is the greatest addition to your lovely family! Thank you Eamon for sharing your heart…we are sending tons of love from Seattle. Bec, keep fighting, you got this!  🥰
Bec's smile made my Day!! Eamon, you rock and remember it is a marathon not a sprint, so pace yourself!! I pray for you both at least 3 times a day because God's tender mercies in my cancer battle and heart issues! I have defibrillator and pacemaker, all in one these Days since my 3 major cancer operations threw by body out of balance with potassium and magnesium and I actually died but for a male nurse doing compressions for over 3 minutes to bring me back!! Life is great with 5 wonderful children and 13 grandchildren, 10 which are girls, pink is one of my favorite colors!! Know God is in charge and He'll put his arms around you to give you comfort and peace!! Love from afar!! D
Your dog is the best ❤️
Omg Osso fighting you guys for his couch made me laugh out loud ! I’m so happy that you guys have him through this time. Dogs are honestly angels sent from heaven I believe. Big hugs to you both. Lots of love xx
Bec is such an amazing and brave girl.  👍. She will be okay.  Now I know travel bloggers can have so much potentials for many capabilities.
Thank you so much for making this vlog for us. I’m sure it’s hard to get in front of the camera and try to act upbeat & productive when your heart & soul is intensely focused on Bec. I always feel so bad for partners of the sick because they are so powerless while they try to pour healing and health into their love. On a brighter note: Watching Oso trying to hang onto his couch was a true lol. I actually had to show the husband, who also laughed. True comedy there. Why was Oso coned? I’d sure like to know more about his story. He seems like the perfect companion right now. All my love to all of you. May springtime bring healing and peace.
I absolutely loovve OSO! 🥺🥺🥰🥰                 What A Dude.  Edit: That room is 🔥🔥🔥!!!!
You look amazing Bec !💕🙏🏻Eamon you did a great job with the room and you both have fabulous family’s
So happy to see you guys building again! Fantastic job Eamon!! A bit of a technical question. What’s the square footage of this space?
Million dollar value on this house now %100 🤑  But also priceless 😉☺️
I definitely miss seeing you guys more often but I could never put that ahead of your well-being. I am so happy to see what you guys have been up to. Bec is still the most darling of all I love seeing her smile. Eamon you are just a blessed being in this earth. Thank you opening up and sharing space with us about how you’ve been doing. Bec is going to keep kicking ass like she always does and you both will continue to inspire all of us 🥰   The new room looks absolutely immaculate and I dream to have a place like you guys have created for yourself!!
Unless someone has been a caretaker of a loved one they will not always understand what it is like.  Eamon please make sure you take care of your self as much as you do Bec.  I do not know what I would do without my daughters help.   The room turned out great.  Bec you are looking so good and glad at the time of this video you were half way done.  Take care!!
Loving OSO he's such a character he must brighten your days. Lovely to see you doing something positive and being surrounded by family. Throughout this difficult journey you've both remained strong and inspirational, I'm sure you have dark moments but your sense of humour still shines bright. Love you guys sending love from Wales xxx
That dog is the best! I think he came into your lives for a reason. 🙏
Love to you guys and Puppy Bear ♥️♥️♥️
The joy of a dog is so humbling. He's one in a million.
That room is so beautiful now! such good vibes
as ever, an inspiring video and great to see you two still keeping strong. thank you for all your hard work and determination. you inspire us everyday ❤❤ take care!
I am so happy to see your vlog today.  I have truly missed you both.  The room renovation looks great.  Eamon, I have been in your situation as a single caregiver for my 38 year old husband (cancer), 73 year old mama (emphazima), 78 year old daddy (conjested heart failure), and 63 year old sister (melanomia).  Life will always have ups and downs but with God by your side, you and Bec can both get through this.  He will carry you when you can't walk, He will breathe for you when you feel you can't take another breath, He will give you all of the comfort and peace needed to get through the path that He has chosen for you both to take.  Bec, you look amazing and strong and have the most beautiful smile I have ever seen.  I remember on the last vlog that one of you stated that there was a possibility that you may not be able to post every week and I totally understand.  But, I have thought about and prayed for you both daily.  God bless you and your families and keep you safe.  Love, Donna
Nice looking porch!  I doubt if your building inspector is going to like how far apart the balusters are up on the loft.
well done!
Love you guys. Wishing you power or healing, good spirits, strength, happiness and blessings. Prayers your way always praying for you both.  You guys are a beautiful 😻 fun loving couple so nice to see that. Love the support you have fir each other. Get better daily.
I love the OSO cam while he was eating 😀. He is such a fun cool dog.
What an amazing guy you are Eamon….I feel for you……and you Bec keep strong and positive… you have so much love around you all and lastly your unbelievable doggy … he’s soooooooo lovely xx
Why doesn't screen door open inwards, make it easier in winter? Luv Oso, you guys keeping him?
Wow what a transformation looks awesome guys. And great to see you both again ❤️
Thank you for being her rock and talking to us. I'm so proud of you for sticking through it all. Remember to keep pushing forward. That front room is looking great. ❣️🙏Stay strong Eamon and Bec!
The room looks soo amazing!!! Y’all have the best ideas and vision.   A shout out to the support you both have. Eamon, sending you love, taking care of someone dear to you takes an emotional toll and appreciate you for opening up. And bec, you’re such a gem. I always look forward to your energy and face 💕 and many love to the doggy!
Wow you guys are amazing  👏  The new room looks great..and Bec looks wonderful too..much love to you all xxx
Oso is so funny!! Especially loved the couch moving fiasco! 😂 I bet he's a real mood lifter for you both.
You guys make me cry each time I watch your videos. Thank god for hilarious Oso! Much love and strength sent to you both.
Mamahalin ko kayo habang buhay.!!! 🇵🇭🥹
Love you both!!!  :-)
The Talmud specifically derives from the Torah that, a physician is allowed to heal, but nowhere has a doctor been given the right to determine that an ill person is incurable. So know that everything is going to be just fine!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stay strong Emon&Bec! Lost of love form the Netherlands 🌹 thinking of you alot
I want everything to go well for you both. Hang in there! Hugs
Sending lots of love and positive, healing vibes for both of you♡
Osso trying to get on couch is so precious… very sweet (and funny).
Love seeing you guys and all the family support. Bec you look Amazing, your personality shines through, no chemo stopping you!! Eamon your emotions are real, hard to hide that stuff when you Love someone so so much. You guys got this.... Sending Love and Prayers.... Oh Bec, love your coloring
So so excited to see you guys on video together. You are in our prayers all the time and are looking so forward to seeing you on the other side of this journey stronger then ever. Love you and appreciate you both!💕💕💕
Warm hugs, healing prayers and much love from California.  If you're going to let smaller kids play in the loft the vertical bars need to be closer together.
Amazing...Love you guys
You are both awesome people!  So wonderful how you are meeting this challenge together!

Hi from Hong Kong!  Its great to see the both of you on YouTube again.  Bec you look great and stay strong!  Eamon, I get you, its not easy staying strong for your women but its also ok with sometimes get some rest and let it all out!  Both of you rock!  Lots of positive energy come out from the both of you....and the gym looks really good!
Osso is so precious 🥰🥰
Very pretty porch. I'm sure you will enjoy. Great job.
So proud of you both!   Love the new space.  It rocks.  Prayers and seeing you both on  mountain tops having a blast.  Thanks for sharing your lives with us!  I have my own medical situation so know i get how hard it can be.  Mooji satsongs really help me.
Oh so happy to see you post! I have missed you two so so much!! Love you two!!
So much love to you both. Y'all are going through a very tough situation & somehow make the best of it. I so admire you both. Keep being strong & y'all will get through it. Also if you need to cry, do just that. It does help.  Wish you both the very best. My thoughts & prayers are with y'all always. Lots of love from Texas.
Looks great! Cannot imagine what is left to do except enjoy your beautiful cabin in the woods. Wish I could hug you Eamon…. You are doing a great job of pampering your girl yet letting her feel strong enough to build a wall. Love that you have such a comfortable home in the woods to heal. Continuing to cheer you both on.   Curious to know how many days/week of work it took to finish that room.
May the lord keep you and bless you always🙏🏼
You guys are the best! It's beautiful!
Beautiful transformation on that area!   While I missed not seeing Bec as much as usual, I must admit it was great to get an update from you Eamon. It's great to see some of what you have been up to.  Keeping you both in my thoughts and prayers. Lots of love. ❤️  P.S. Was also great to see Tim!
Ok, I think with everything else going on, I lost track on your dogs. Do you have 2, Oso, and Bear? Or has Oso found a forever home? I loved how persistent Oso was about the couch! Too cute and funny! Bec it's good to see you recognizing your limits when you need to. And wow at what you accomplished when you were feeling a bit stronger! And to you, Eamon, thank you for the update on how you're doing. It's ok to feel what you feel, and I hope you have friends or family you can express that to, as well. You've been amazing in your support of Bec! My prayers of healing and strength go out for both of you!!
Continued healing to Bec and also Eamon, I’m used to being the rock as well for others. I have the need to be in control, we all need to learn to not fixate on the dark thoughts and if needed get more help for your mental health. Mine is a lot of anxiety which makes the mind race, do the what ifs and all the scary stuff comes up. You both are very strong and it is ok to not be okay, you’re both going through a hard time as anyone with a cancer diagnosis will. I love keeping up with you both since I found your page. Best wishes and healing thoughts to you both! Amazing workout studio Eamon, Bec and family! DIY always takes 3x longer than you think! Oso is the best btw!! 🌱💕
Millie bobby brown looks like Bec
Best to you both! Rich
Thank you to the two of you as you continue on this journey with such positive attitudes. An amazing transformation of the porch. Wonderful family support is delightful to watch. Bec I love your mandala colouring in. I create mandalas and have wanted to send you one but how do you send pictures in this format?  Nevertheless congratulations to you both and your families.  Your strength in sharing this journey is inspiring.  Blessings to you both from Brisbane Australia.
You all always make me hungry!
Please  say if Oso is staying he's such a sweetheart
If you ever need a cone again.  Go to Walmart and cut some foam swim noodles and run a collar though them and the best collar ever for dogs who tear through the vets cone
Was the foam stinky before you covered it up?  Do you have to seal the beautiful pine wood?  I bet all that fresh wood smells great!  Beautiful home for you and Bec!  It was SO good to see her, and hear her laugh!  Go Bec, you got this!  Warm, sunny vibes from Phoenix to you both and Oso too! ❤️
So glad to see you both missed watching your videos lots of love and prayers sent your way ❤️
Made me so happy to see a notification  that yall made a video. So happy to see yall 💓
It was lovely to watch this episode…every week I look to see if there is a new one.  I ran the gauntlet of feelings watching from laughter to tears.  Sending you love and good thoughts. 😊💕
The porch transformation is great!  Loved seeing it all come together. But Oso trying to sit on the couch as it left the porch was priceless and hysterical.   So glad to see you both on video and Eamon thank you for speaking to us from your heart. We all worry about you and want to support you as well as Bec. You are as amazing as Bec Eamon.   Sending you both much love and prayers and energy.
Funniest ever with the dog and stairs, priceless, happy healing bec!
I went from laughing at Osso’s couch obsession to getting misty eyed listening to Eamon. You both are so strong .  Eamon , you killed it on the sunroom!! Bec,  it was good to see your smile!
I feel like I have to tell you guys how much I love you in every video. I legit got anxiety because I didn’t comment. Thank you thank you thank you soooooo much for including us into your lives.
Wow :) number 2 on trending! Congrats guys!
Hang in there Bec. Better days and life ahead. You two rest! Very important. My wife made it through, you two will also. Positive thoughts bring positive energy. So important.
On the finished room....I think you need to add a window bench along the lake side for Oso....since his sofa was stolen away from him.  Just sayin'. 😉😙
Eamon shave ur head😁
You should make the couch bit a tiktok.
I love little osso. He so cute. i wish i had him. so glad you guys are getting though everything . sending lots of love.
I just love watching your whole family. That dog has both your personalities. I sincerely adore you all💜
You’ve been so amazing throughout this whole situation! You both are strong and beautiful!
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
Eamon, stay strong bud! Your an awesome husband!!
Oso: "-This couch is staying here." also Oso: "You took my couch... I'm breaking these cones because you took my couch."
All the continued love and support to you both from my home. Loving the new home improvements, and especially how good Bec looks!
The dog and eamon are so comical together.
You are both so amazing. Bec, you look adorable without hair! I am praying for you for a full, complete, permanent healing.🙏 The cabin looks beautiful-a little slice of heaven. 🥰 God bless you both
Hi to Tim 👋nice to see him again, looking well and being his happy self.👍Hope u doing good Eamon and Bec.❤️
I've been waiting to see you both again! Prayers & hugs! Porch is looking great!
dog mouth cam.... bahahaha!!!
The porch looks good… But, there was a major mistake. You are missing one important element… Oso’s couch! Poor little guy. There are healing/meditative powers in coloring. That may also want to try Zentangle.
❤️❤️❤️🙏
Way to go Eamon &  Bec & your families helping ,You're both thought of daily. Take Good Care
Hey my rockstars!! Praying for  Bec and loving the Bear!!! 💖💖what a fabulous joy to the family💋🙏🏽💖
you look so beautiful love the video.  you two are so amazing.
My dog vanilla she had her surgery 9 days ago. As soon as we came home off came it🤣 she hasn’t gone near her stitches at all! And we’re very lucky that she’s been so good! Poor thing was tripping and falling over with it on!
32:53 my boy needs to work on his chip up game 💀
💜💜
Magnifique rénovation !! Et quel plaisir de vous voir heureux. Pleins de bonheurs à tout les deux et surtout la santé retrouver. Je vous envoie toutes mon énergie positive. 🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤
Great job! Looking great Babygirl. ❤️ Keep it up! Love you guys! ✌🏼🌎☺️✅
Send you all my love and prayers, keep fighting and loving, you both are amazing superheroes. From the middle of the world Quito - Ecuador ♥️
You both are inspiring, strong, vulnerable and full of love for each other and all those around you. Very heart warming. So glad Oso is in your lives. He looks like such a goofy yet loving character.   Your multipurpose room looks amazing. Stay strong and see you Sunday♥️
Legit I love you guys sooooooooo much!!!!!!! Don't even know yall but I feel it through your videos. <3 Sending you joy and peace and sadness and anger and whatever else you need to feel. and Also, it's crazy to see how much you've transformed the house--it is unbelievable! I've got a lot of work to do on mine, and I thank you for the inspiration :- )
Its time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them if you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning willfully, and follow his word and obey it, strive to do those things. That’s following the Lord Jesus. Read the Bible and find wisdom!!
Beautiful room!! Congrats
You guys have done so well with the build! It's good to see Bec getting on with life and smashing it! Ian from Australia.
It's been so long, I love bec and Eamon videos. You've been in mu thoughts bec. ❤❤❤❤

We are all out here supporting you too Eamon. You are also a warrior and for those of us that have been in your shoes as supporting a loved one you're doing just perfectly ❤
I hope you both continue smashing it out, but on a side note.... because head looks so flash I reckon she could rock it all year long. See you Sunday babbbbby!!
Love for eamon and bec❤️❤️❤️

Love it! How awesome that your family is rallying around you to help out 🥰 You guys are amazing!
And you guys are so talented and handy!!
👏👏👏
Love and prayers to you both,  I also was care giver to my hubby with cancer... it is so hard to watch them hurt.
I want to start of saying....my cheeks hurt from smiling this entire video! I have missed your beautiful smiles! I find myself checking everyday for a new video. Eamon and Bec you both are most definitely one of my happy places! Oso is a total Rock Star! Bec I'm so happy to see you doing so well! You look gorgeous! Eamon thank you for sharing how you are doing.  That couldn't have been easy for you. Wow yall did an amazing job on your workout room! Ok sorry I didn't mean to ramble on. I guess I got super excited seeing this video. Take care. Sending love and positive vibes from Mississippi! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗😘✌️
I've been waiting for this video. Love you both and I'm so glad you are both doing well. The gym looks awesome!!! ❤️
🤣I’m hollering! Oso is great! Those cones got beat to shit quick! The couch thing was hilarious too. Y’all are so lucky to have him. Thank you for the great video. It was really nice catching up with y’all & seeing family & TIM!  Love to you all.  I ❤️that 🐕
Seeing your strengths all the way from nz is amazing!
❤️❤️❤️
❤️
I know life can be tough It's the small things in life keep up the good work and thank you for the content and I hope you guys all doing good and well
Osso and the couch was bust a gut funny.
thinking about u both! sending love <3
Great job Eamon and family! Good to see Bec be able to do her part because it would have bothered her later.
Ramon, thanks for sharing how you are doing through this journey by Bec’s side. I am guessing I wasn’t the only person who asked how you were dealing with life at the m9ment, beautiful job on the new room!
💛💛💛💛💛💛
Positives  waves your way guys.  Nothing but love for the both of you.
That loft needs the bars to be closer, especially if you ever allow kids up there..  look up minimum distance
Praying for you both..
praying for you Eamon, Bec too of course. Hang in there friend
My heart ❣️. I laughed I Cried, I Prayed for You and Bec. You have The Best Tribe surrounding you both. Your Family and Friends helping on the cabin bringing more Laughter, Love & Positivity to you both on this Journey. Sending you Love, Light and Positive Energy your Way, you are So loved ❣️🙏❣️🙏
Oso is the perfect dogs for you guys.  What a love.
I missed you guys. Sending hugs your way.
Hi guys!  Bec, you look beautiful with or without hair!  It will grow back anyway.  Eamon, sometimes I think it is harder on the caregiver.  You both will come out of this absolutely fine!  You guys are always in my prayers and I have God listening!  I love you guys ♥️
It's a different hard to be the support and caretaker.  Much love Eamon ❤️ and to Bec healing vibes
Great to see you guys! Sending love 💗 to my a both and hopefully a little ☀️ from California!
What a wonderful video!  I love the way you showed time moving.  I think your new entrance/gym is fantastic.   Eamon I just have to say I appreciated what you shared.  As someone a few decades older I can tell you the epiphany of my life was when I realized that usually control is an illusion.  Understanding that and accepting it (sort of) was life charging.  Wishing you both the very best!
I was so happy to see you both today! I’ve missed you but was also worried about Bec. I kept checking your Instagram and Facebook for a little update. So glad your doing okay and have lots and lots of support from your families! Sending lots of love to you both. Paul in Vancouver
When you love someone… their disease becomes your disease!!!
My Love To You Both❤️
WELCOME BACK!! Missed you both and sending love and prayers to both of you.    OMFG.... love that Osso!! I never laughed so hard watching his destruction of his cone and the after math of him having the cone on.
Brilliant job on the gym/yoga room.......absolutely nailed it!!!!!! (pun intended)    Love you guys xo you keep your chins up.
LOOKS AMAZINGGGGGG ( bec not the mini loft )
Sending so much love. Your strength is inspiring 💜💜💜
I am so proud of u guys going through this tough time
So happy to see the both of you and to see Bec up and doing different things, coloring is so fun.  I can kind of understand for I am going through my own thing.  Stay strong Bec we all love you guys and wish you the best.  Your energy and strength keeps me going as well.  Eamon your the best, take care of your queen.
Eamon you crack me up! xo.....
U should keep that dog! Hes perfect! Omg hes licking your feet girl! Special skills! I get it its hard! U can do this both of u! Stay strong💪!Wow those mandalas are beautiful 😍 I never finish mine... I love your beauty! Its nice to see u both!
Get him a soft cone of shame.  Or an inflatable doughnut.  Poor buddy.
You guys should watch the documentary A Beautiful Truth. It's a seriously important cancer documentary. It might give you guys a boost of hope! <3
So happy to see our sweet girl up and smiling.
You took Oso's couch??   He is devastated.   Poor buddy.
Thanks for opening up Eamon.  It may surprise you that, at least for me, some of the most engaging moments of your videos  are when you and Bec allow for us to see your vulnerability.  Not that I want you to experience all of this.  Of course not.  It's just that by sharing your personal struggles it allows me to feel more connected.  Really good to see you out and working it Bec.  You are doing so beautifully and I'm so glad you have such an amazing partner.  The room, by the way,  looks fantastic!
Eaton no explanation was needed about your struggle and emotions through this journey with Bec. The love you show and share with Bec is all we need. Oh an awesome job on the room makeover. Your smile Bec shines through always . 🇦🇺🇦🇺XOXO
this gave me so much motivation to do the work i've been dreaming of on my house. my husband and i now own his childhood house. as a pre-fab, it's getting OLD and i've recently been slowly remodeling. now i'm seeing all new visions, thank you for sharing this!
Missed you.  Hang in there honey you don't owe us anything. We are all in a fxxxed up life right now.
Peace and love and all the blessings to you both.
Thank you for letting us in. This one made our day.
So happy to see you guys staying strong. Also, that new room is looking amazing! Sending good energy your way. 💕
Nice to see you building again! Sending lotsa warm California love your way. ❤️🎥🍾🥂
i have been completely overwhelmed lately with so much stuff and I just finished a huge paper for my school and idk if it'll go well but I'm glad this video is out so i can relax a bit which i haven't done in a long time
That is a beautiful room! Sending healing thoughts your way Bec. Eamon, I look after my Mom who has dementia and it is so important to take care of yourself as the caregiver. It's great that you are taking on projects and keeping yourself busy so you can be there for Bec.
Bec is so so cute!
❤👍
Omgggg!!! Finally I'm so happy to see you both, the strength and courage between you both does not go unnoticed, do much love for you guys!!  Since watching this vlog I've been searching for the pan type you used for the crunch wrap for 10ish min... What brand is it?
Such good energy :) yes make the entrance to your place full of intention, welcome and  - yup there's some silliness too!  Glad to see the B team crew. Eamon good job with VLOG - wild to have you do all the narration and camera. Bec your boy been doing good. Healing vibes
Sidenote: do put a good lock on the tool shed and a curtain so people can't see in. Rookie mistake to leave a tool shed like that. You're supplying a burglar with all the tools he needs to break into your house. Don't do that, even in the middle of the woods. lol
Love you guys.  Stay strong Bec, you got this. Oh Oso, I love him too. Prayers to you Eamon, you are human with real feelings.  I love the porch. Prayers for all always stay strong.
LOVE TO SEE TIM. I was worried after the deck reno and after the problems y'all dropped him. Obv...not his fault and I'm so happy to see him back in your vids!
Peace and strength to both of you Bec and Eamon from Siggi and Eric in Seattle. Climbing the mountain takes the team to get To the top. As the partner/caregiver for Siggi’s mountain climb I know how difficult it can be to be the rock in the storm. Half way there is a big accomplishment! Take care, rest when you need to and celebrate the little things! Before you know it, it will all be in the rear view mirror. When Siggi was done we took a trip to LA, drove down 101 and walked on the beach in Malibu!
All the love for you guys. Stay positive & God will take of the rest. ❤️
You don't owe us anything, know that. We are just concerned and want to know how you both are doing so we can send more love and prayers and hugs your way. You'll both get through this. Cancer sucks for everyone, even when you don't have it but have to watch someone you love go through it. It's still your battle too. You're a team. Bec is strong and loved and while chemo feels like nothing you can describe to someone, it's good to know that it's not the cancer, but the cure that feels so bad so it's a positive thing. There's a war goin' on and the lil bastards are getting wupped and dead and that's what ya want. The bad cells gotta die and no kinda war is fun. She'll be ok. Hugs to you both!
OSO sure loves his couch and begging with every cell in his body not to take it away.   Eamon being a caregiver is a tough row to hoe.   When I was a caregiver I was reminded to take it moment by moment because you can do anything in the moment.   I love that you are being genuine about your feelings, never lose that.   Bec you are doing it grrl.  Kick cancer's ass and enjoy all those who love you including complete strangers on YouTube who love and respect you both.   Remember even in the darkest moments, there is light.
First you stole his couch, then you took his nuts!
Keep the frig for shelves.  Great for no mice to eat in the frig.  The room looks ALMOST as good as you Bec & E.
We missed the videos so thank you for taking the time to record for us❤️ we all hope Bec is doing well and recovering wonderfully
Eamon you the the best my guy! If only more guys could be as compassionate, strong, handy, intelligent, and amazing as you we would be in a better place! Bec we can’t wait to see you on the other side of this! Short term pain long term gain. You are stronger than you will ever know! I loved this blog, and the SpongeBob narration, and puppy GoPro shot. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎 much love to my favorite YouTubers!
I have never clicked on a YouTube notification as quickly as I did this one. I honestly don't even remember what I was doing prior. So relieved to hear from you guys! Love y'all! 🥰
E you and I have the letter E starts our names. I named my daughter Rebekah in 1989.   Thank you for sharing from your ❤️💔❤️🛐✝️🀄. The BEST I can give is PRAYERS in JESUS'S NAME AMEN FROM SE MICHIGAN.  I was born in Long Branch Toranto 🇨🇦.  Thank you for you. Dinner sounds fantastic.  I will reward it so I can try and make it.  The puppy wants HIS COUCH. I love you.  I wrote it as you said it.  Love you pup. GOD BLESS YOU 🌹🌹🌹❤️🀄🀄🀄✝️✝️✝️🛐🛐🛐🛐 Bec, you look AMAZING. You too E. CHOW
My husband had kidney cancer 8 years ago and we just found out last week that he has cancer again, we aren’t sure if it’s kidney cancer again or a new cancer in his lymph nodes. It is tough on the partner too, i know first hand. Always keeping you in my thoughts and I look forward to updates always.
Sending you both so much love and prayers. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Love Osso, he's such a silly gentle giant! The porch looks awesome. Thanks for opening up Eamon. We are all thinking of and behind you both. P.S did anything ever happen with your 'illegal' deck??
Oh Eamon, Your vulnerability and open heartedness takes courage and strength. Thank you for sharing your feelings about this temporary moment in your lives. Big hugs to you, Bec, Oso and your loved ones. Stay strong. All will be well. 🙏🏽✨♥️
The room is beautiful! I’m glad that you have such a special place to rest and heal, and so many people who love you surrounding you guys. I hope the Taxol is kicking ass and taking names. Sending lots of love! 💕
its ok eamon. i know bec will going to heal. we are praying for you guys 🙏 stay strong
GO Bec!
Eamon and Bec Love and respect from down under
She looks so beautiful
Continued prayers for you. Y’all are the cutest couple. Love from Alabama
Y'all are such beautiful people. You too Oso❤️
Thinking about the 2 of you, so happy to see you. Love you guys.
Love the bird feeder. It can almost be meditative to watch a bird feeder!  We had a bird we loved to watch, she would watch the chickadees hide seeds then go and poach them from their hiding spots. Smarty pants bird.
Thank you for being so vulnerable in sharing so much of your highs and lows. You both have so much courage!
Much love and many prayers for you both!
Amazing room. Well done.  Only good wishes for the coming days & weeks!💕🙏
OMG I love Bear!  The bits of him trying to reclaim his couch would have made it on America’s Funniest Home Videos. I’m still laughing.
Thanks for filming, editing, and posting - I know it’s probably a lot. I appreciate seeing what’s going on in your lives since Bec started treatment. Thanks for sharing your heart, Eamon. I love the porch transformation. It’s beautiful!! And poor Oso not wanting his favorite couch to be gone! 😭 This episode had me laughing and crying! Much love to you both!
I’ve been thinking of you and looking for your videos. You are strong. I love the the commenter who said “fight like a girl”. Exactly. Strength. Tenacity. Bravery. So much love, from Virginia’s sunny shore. See you Sunday, Hon.
Thank you for sharing how you built your truly magnificent space prayers for both of you. You cannot get rid of that dog that dog is one in a million and I am a service dog trainer so I know.
You guys are amazing. Thanks for sharing. It's lovely to see you xx
Also a fellow Canadian.  You two are inspirational.  The braveness you share with us while living your most vulnerable moment is sure to help others going through tough times.  Your home is full of love and beauty because of the two of you.  Stay strong.
Bec, love the mandalas! It's nice to see your face beautiful lady!! 🥰
Eamon you knocked this out of the park. The gym looks fantastic.  Thanks for been open and vulnerable Eamon. Never easy been the partner supporting the patient. You and Bec are a solid team and strong. Letting go is often liberating. Our prayers and thoughts are with you both.💗🙏
Bec you look beautiful and so very strong ❤️ and Ramon I’ve been in your shoes you’re doing amazing keeping it together ❤️ you’re both rock stars
Perfect! .....in every way.....I feel like I've just had a nice long chat with an old friend and am sending so much love to you both...to you all!!!! 0000  ❤️
On Athletic Greens: I cannot skip one day now or my gut issues return and I feel blah. Great stuff! So glad to watch you guys again. Great job, Eamon! Osso is cracking me up with the cone. Keep on keepin’ guys. We love you both! 💕
Nice to see ol' Bob. Nice to see he is consuming Athletic Greens! Stay healthy Bob!
Those colored pages look awesome Bec!
I was on my lunch break  and I just started bawling because of what you guys are having to go through. Sending you love, hope and strength. You will make it through this together I can feel it! Love you guys!!❤❤❤
Oso was about to leave you for that couch  🤣 😂  Love u guys...stay strong ❤️
Only thing I can say! You guys are super busy and amazing !!!  Best of luck for you two !!! 👍
Such a beautiful house you two have!!! Excellent workmanship!!
You guys are the best make more videos always wait for the next vlog especially beck should get more involved keep it up
Nice and smart change of pace, glad to see you guys. For sure it's a LOT to be in this situation, sounds like you're on to something with the keeping productive Emmon, and taking the time to have the feels too! Nice work on the space. You guys got this.
You opening up means a lot to me on a personal level Eamon. I am disabled and was in a non-flare up time with my unknown condition when my partner and I met. Shortly after that he has now had to carry a lot of unknown emotional weight while also keeping us housed, fed and on track with our goal to be off grid. He doesn't open up much at all so hearing your words was surprisingly therapeutic in helping me understand how he can feel. Thank you so much for your vulnerability and I'm sending so much wellness and peace to you & Bec <3
Sending you healing thoughts and best wishes every day.  I am fighting the same battle.  The unpredictable nature of the experience was hard to get used to for me, but easier once I learned to deal with each day separately.   Your humor and support for each other will see you through.
Your projects always turn out so beautiful. Happy to hear that Bec is halfway through her chemo and love to see her power through on her good days. 💕
Eamon, what a beautiful job on that entry room… so much thought went into it! We’ll done! I also want to congratulate you on being so honest on your mental honesty with how difficult it is for both of you….. you have a heart of gold and I truly believe God is there for you and Bec! As always, sending you prayers and hugs!
You guys are just awesome! Our lil dynamic duos! 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
Both of you are just amazing both with and for each other! Big hugs from Australia for you both! Great reno too, looks totally fabulous!
You guys rapping and dancing just madee ugly cry. I hope to have such a love as your one day
LOVE U GUYS!!!  U & UR FAMILIES R INCREDIBLE. SO MUCH LOVE TO GET U THROUGH!  Okay next order of business.....LOVE UR GYM😊 What's ur guys' Peloton Leaderboard names?  Oh and Osso 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Oso and his couch had me dying laughing.  Love you guys.
This video made our weekend! We don't know either of you, but my family is praying for you both.  You are such a beautiful couple, and we enjoy watching your energetic and positive videos each week.  Thank you for bringing us along on this journey. I know you are helping so many people who are experiencing similar situations.  What a blessing you truly are.  You are beautiful,  by the way.  (You too, Eamon).  Also, you both have such lovely families! So glad you have so much support around you.  Love from Missouri, USA!
You are a great man keep on being strong, but don’t forget to take care of yourself also. Sending many prayers for you and Bec! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ sending so much love!!!
I think about you guys all the time! Sending you all the positive energy <3 Eamon thank you for having the courage to be vulnerable. You guys have really had a positive impact on my life and I am so so thankful for you both.
Sending love and strength to you both!  I’ve been in remission for 13 months now and couldn’t have made it through without my amazing husband. People forget that cancer hits caregivers so hard.
Absolutely loved the new space and all the work everyone put into it. Very inclusive! Sending you love and good energy from San Diego.
California here!  so so glad to see you guys!!! Eamon,  when you expressed your feelings of pain and your love for Bec, my heart just melted.  hugs to you.  And that yoga/exercise room!!!  wow!!! what a beautiful transformation!!   Bec, almost finished with chemo!  thats awesome news!! btw, your looking so pretty:)  Watching your supportive families is amazing!  Sending lots of love and positive energy your way!!! You guys got this!!!
Praying for you brother, it’s tough for us guys to see the ones we love going through sickness.
Hey. I love your content. But please be careful with VitD, because if you don't have a deficiency, it can kill you. So please be super careful on what you put into your body. You should not drink Vitamine E without a doctors check.
Bec, youre an absolute beast. i love youe both, and the fact you are hairless changes nothing in terms of who you are. fiber is your inner being, and your smile is generated by how fabulous of a person you are! ive been bald for 2 years now, but im not nearly as sexy as you are! Eamon can verify  that you do not need hair to be a beautiful spirit. i can still see the beautiful aura that surrounds you. a follower since you traveled to mexico, and i hope you both know you are loved by many
Lmao just as I’m wondering how long until he has tape on his cone Eamon starts taping it
This space is so beautiful! Going to be such a lovely healing space for Bec to  feel grounded again after tough treatment days. Sending lots of light to both of you as Bec finishes out her second half of chemo 💜 Seeing the support you have for each other is so uplifting!
You are such a loving and supportive team. Your families are also fantastic. Our Pets are so healing and supportive also. They sense and know when we need their love. You guys have got this. Sending you both much love and energy. Xx Trish
Love and prayers for both of you! God Bless
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This might be a dumb question haha but did you guys chose to keep Bear? Cause if so I think that's an absolutely amazing idea, he is absolute perfection for your family!
My thoughts and prayers are with you guys, this too shall pass 🙏
Love the fitness / Zen room. Really love your families love for you 3, and I love Oso and Eamon and Bec, how beautiful and true you are. You make us all feel special and loved. Thank you ❤️
Perfect situation for a HVAC 'Split' unit.  Easy to install  and energy efficient.
Buy batt insulation do it yourself
Sending lots of ❤ to the both of u from this old gal in Ohio. You two r just amazing.
Free to a good home - one couch, large dog included!
So good to see a video you both have been on my mind everyday. Bec you are looking amazing and I am blown away by how strong and resilient you are.  Eamon you are amazing, hang in there mate things will get better. The room looks great you and your family have done a brilliant job. Sending lots of love and hugs to you both from New Zealand.
So cute seeing Oso on the trampoline ❤️
Looks great, Eamon-Bec sure will be glad when you are all well again, Best Wishes Always
This video is so worth it just for the couch dog.
Go ahead and cry
So glad to see Bec is doing better and getting stronger.   May prayers for your continued success
Thank you so much for sharing this hard part of your lives we are here for you guys 100% of the way! I love Oso so much
So glad to see an update
Thank you for updating us on everyone! The room looks great! So nice to see Bec’s smile. Miss you guys! Keep busy! Better days are coming! 🤍💪
Well done on the porch makeover 🏆  Much love to you both💓
I'm so glad to hear from you! Blessings 🙌 🙌
And then I was waiting for you to have the Go Pro spray foamed somehow, heh heh. The dog dish perspective was fun too!  I'm sending you Eamon huge hugs of comfort, courage, empathy and serenity.  You showing your vulnerability is healthy and good... that adds to the optimism, hope, strength and stamina you have as you continue to be Bec's rock and love.  May light and hope continue to shine upon both of you!
Oso’s couch 😭😂
Don’t be afraid of checking out other treatment centers that are out of the country. Cancer treatment is an industry. There is an older book called Cancer Industry. Also there is a man named Chris who has healed himself of stage 4 cancer.
Wishing you both all the best!❤️
it's always such a wonderful experience to watch from some another part of the world in my studio. Thanks so much! : )
You both are doing so well, we have been where you are and it’s no easy path.  Know that you don’t owe us anything, but thank you for your vulnerability I think it’s important for others to see the challenge for what it is. Bec can focus on getting Howell because she knows you are the rock.
It looks SO good! The floor really connects the space to the rest of the house. Nice work.
Ive been watching you guys for a long time now and this is my first comment. Im not sure why i havent said any of this before but i love you guys. I look forward to every Sunday when you guys post. Ive been able to travel the world with you and see things in detail that i will most likely not be able to see in this lifetime. You guys are an inspiration and Bec you are so strong. I hope for a happy and safe and successful recovery for you Bec and ill keep your health in my prayers. Keep strong guys! Love you! ❤
Love the intro , and Oso is super happy ! Glad to see Bec 🎈🎈🥳🥳
Love y’all
Love you guys
Hugs to you Eamon! It is difficult as a partner to see your s/o in unfortunate situations. Thinking of you both sending so much LOVE to your families!
My favourite 🤩 YouTube makers are back!
Looks amazing! Praying for Bec and her recovery.
Much love to you guys!! Keep up the great work Bec!!
Great work and good vibes your way!
Feel so lucky to witness a tiny slice of your inspiring life.  Selfishly missed your vlogs. You are two lovely souls facing a challenging season yet I cannot think of anything to add to help you on your journey because you are handling it exactly as you should…keeping busy and creative and dealing with emotions as best as you can while surrounded by a loving family.  The new space is just Wow! You are both the best!  Huge hugs!
Keep it up guys!!! That room turned out amazing!!!
We all could use an Eaman in our lives.  🥰😘😍
Gosh I could cry! It’s amazing to see your gorgeous face Bec! So much love to you and Eamon!!!!

Happy to see you two keeping busy and thriving! WHAT a transformation!!!! So super pretty.
Love you guys so much. Stay strong forever!
Love you Eamon and Bec! I'll be praying for you two, I love your videos and will always be an supporter! You two have given me the motivation to build my own van and chase my dreams🙏hope you will be back to chasing yours as soon as possible!
Oso on the couch was too funny 😆.
You both have so much to celebrate.   Going through this valley will make you stronger.  Thanks for sharing your life with us.   We know both of you will come out of this stronger and with even more love and perspective.    Love to you both!.
So good to see you both again  (and the whole fam!) Miss you guys so its such a treat when you are able to post ( and on my bday!) <3
As a mother of a child with cancer I feel you so much Eamon. It’s so hard to watch the ones you love hurting from chemo
Im so glad Beck that you are for the most feeling good, great to see you again.Your family is the best helping out on the workout room.The loft is my favorite part, yes the whole workout room is amazing.
Loved seeing the Spurs sweatshirt!!
Eamon, thank you for opening up around this. Real.  Glad Bec is doing so well as can be .  Surrounding you both in good  Loves & soothing healing vibes all around <3 🐾🐕 💝💞
Perfect opportunity for a "Pivot" reference lol! Love you guys💗 stay strong and I'm sending positive vibes
congrats on trending!!!
I love you guys! You 2 make a beautiful team.
I have been so worried about you two. It's nice to see you! I am going to make 5 comments because it's a simple way to support the channel.  You don't owe us anything Eamon. Thank you for sharing but for real...you don't owe us anything. So much love.
I love to see you both being so positive. You both are both rays of sunshine. Sending all the love!
Oh you 2... I cried, then laughed, then cried. Bec you are badass! And rocking the no hair (My bare alopecia head is not nearly as adorable). Eamon... you are also badass! Room looks like an amazing healing space. What a peaceful view❤ congrats on your foster fail... Oso is adorable. Thinking of you both❤🇨🇦
So glad to see you both in a vlog today, I have missed hearing Bec’s laugh! Eamon, the porch looks so awesome! You guys did such a great job! Continued thought and prayers for you two!❤️
You two are so good together. Stay strong!
That was a to video, Eamon you are a super star, I so enjoy your projects and love Bear and the inclusion of all the Bear fun clips, really funny, Bec looks amazing with her hair and without, so glad you are both coping. Thanks for sharing.
🥰💕❣️💗💞🥰💕❣️❣️💞🐶
Oh Eamon. You do you. You don’t us anything. Thanks for sharing, but you have to do what’s best for you and Bec, with or without a camera.
Dream cabin and it just keeps getting dreamier. So much love for you both!
Finally!  We were missing you and so worried.  Love you guys! A big hug from 🇨🇱  Chile 🙌💛
💚 sending love from Kentucky 🇺🇸💚
...love and positive thoughts going your way from Australia.
Had me laughing the whole video.  Well done guys. Keep up the great work!
Hello Eamon and bec happy to see you guys missed you bec your such a strong woman sending prayers and love renovation looking good already Eamon can't wait to see the finished result
🙏Prayers
I have looked everyday to see if you are back. I hope Bec is handling the chemo well and sending you both good wishes for a great outcome in your journey.
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Eamon your a good man and I know its tough to watch some one you love go through a tough time, but I know she is so much better off with you by her side, it is great to see how much you love each other, you do a great job looking after her❤
If Beck is using Cannabis or CBD on her journey I think that would be interesting to talk / learn about. I know it’s legal in most parts of Canada not sure if that’s in every part of the country. So happy to see you guys again!
I remember back on the 1st day you saw the cabin n y'all were like 😬 well... You have created such a beautiful, amazing oasis!!!! I mean I would rent that loft! 😂 Great job guys!!!!
Adam is hilarious with his UGG Boots 😂😂
Did you get your permits this time.
You need to get oso another couch. So precious ❤️
Love you guys so much! Your A~mazing!!! 🌼🌼🌼
I miss bec (love u bec) but Eamon, your truly killing it. Best to the both of you. 💗💗

Proud of you two beautiful humans.  Much love from Idaho!
Eamon and Bec, you guys are amazing. Please know that you are spreading hopes and loves all over the world. Also could you please share your Peloton user names? I am sure lots of viewers would love to follow you guys!!

Welcome Back!  Bec is amazing courage with a huge heart.Eamon is completely nuts. Does he ever stop ? Peace
Love this video! You both are so incredibly strong not only are you fighting a disease but the way you tell your story with such beauty and grace is trully incredible and admirable. Sending so much love!
Perfect space for this chapter of your lives! Sending love, and healing energy to you both.
I think about you two all the time. I am sending love and prayers to you both. Bec, you are a beautiful soul and shine so bright! You are loved by so many people, you have touched a lot of hearts. You got this! There are so many things for you to do in this world. Eamon, I love how you captured all the silly things Bear/Oso (spelling?) does! Made me laugh a lot lol. Love to you both ❤ Amazing job Eamon!
Much love and prayers coming your way from New Hampshire!! ❤️
OMG Oso! 🐶🤣😂🤣  My sister is going thru the same kind of cancer & I just want both of you to know that every time I send prayers, healing energy, & love to her, I send it to you, too. I have watched your vids from the beginning & have lived my dream of van life vicariously through you . Both of your strength & determination has been evident from the beginning. You got this!! 💕💕 🦾🦾 #strongerthancancer
I was very relieved to see a video post! Not for my own entertainment, just that if they are still making videos then Bec is still strong and doing ok!  Also, amazing work Eamon!! You are so talented! That little loft is awesome!
I was so happy to see your video this evening. I have been thinking about you and praying for both of you!  I am an older lady and I have very much enjoyed meeting you this past year on your channel. Stay strong and take all the support you are being given. Bless you both.
Just want to say…Imagine getting a diagnosis of ALS.  No treatment, just FATAL.  At least you have the opportunity of treatment.  There is so much more opportunity.  Your positivity is awesome and such an advantage!  Keep it up!!  I lost my best fella to ALS 9 years ago.
the room looks so amazing!!!!! and keep being strong bec love ya
omg where did you guys  get that turtle holder where your sunglasses are!!!? I need one
The room/gym looks amazing.. the view while exercising and healing is so important!  Take all the time, rests, coloring breaks you need Bec.  You have to accept your limitations for now but the comeback is around the bend!  Coming from one who knows!  💕
Love you guys! We appreciate you both and glad you guys bring us along for the ride. Perseverance 💜
The room looks sick wish you both good health
Missed you both so much. You have popped into my mind Bec so many times. I say a prayer 🙏🏻 for you to be well and am saddened that you are dealing with this. On the days when I was low through this last few years I found you both to lift my spirits and loneliness. God bless you both. Life is such a journey and there are really hard things along the path that are designed to help us grow in some way. I’m so sorry 😢 I don’t understand it. Listening to spiritual people on YouTube I’ve learned that not going to the dark places in our thoughts (worry) Etc. Worry is like praying for what you don’t want. Choose to only think about what you want and you manifest what we want and healing. They said if you give those negative thoughts an inch they will take a mile. Sending you blessings, smiles, hugs, and inner peace. Lots of deep breaths and meditation to ease you weary soul. Rest.❤️🙋🏼‍♀️
can’t keep a good woman or the eamon down.  💙💛💙. and oso is such a good boy.  sending my best, as always…. 🕉
So happy to see that Eamon is keeping himself busy. Still doing that punch list to make you both comfortable. Bec is lucky to have you as her rock. You are self motivated to keep going and have a great crew to help while Bec is getting better. Supporting each other is the best way to show how much you love and respect each other. Looks like you both have great examples of that.
<3 love you both, great vid love how the renovations came out
Oh yes, I’m 74 and trying to get comfortable with the illusion of control. Best to you both🌸🌸🌸
i don't knpw you's but I Love you's very much - from New Zealand 😍🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👌💫💥🤛
🤍🤍 HANG IN THERE AND STAY ENCOURAGED. CHEMO WILL BE COMPLETED IN NO TIME.   THE OSO CAM HAS ME CRYING !!!! THAT’S THE FUNNIEST DOG CAM I HAVE EVER SEEN !!! THAT CONE WAS HILARIOUS. THE SOUNDS WHEN OSO WAS EATING HAD ME ROLLING !!! I’VE NOT LAUGHED SO HARD IN A VERY VERY LONG TIME !!!🤍🤍
Absolutely beautiful addition! Love all your videos. So raw and deep. Had me in tears a couple of times. Love you guys and your Bear is such a goofy joy. Keep doing everything your doing, soon this will be over and you’ll be out touring the world again! ❤️
Is the dogs full name o so funny?
Get better bec
Hang in there guys ♥️ there’s light at the end of the tunnel! You two beautiful souls will be back to a new normal soon !!
Hang in there Bec (and Eamon), halfway there!  A couple of those mandalas looked pretty cool
Eamon, the greatest lesson you will learn in life is that we control nothing. We plan, make goals, and work to fulfill them but we cannot control what happens. So, life is a series of plan A that leads to plan B that are countered by what is required to deal with the unexpected. Stay sane. Thoughts and prayers.
Eamon you are a true hero!!! I have ways seen you both as strong, loving, real, just unique and powerful people!! As a couple you just seem invincible and the unconditional love just flows out of you both! This chapter in your story tho has shown the incredible man you truly are!! I cannot imagine your pain and the true depths of how hard this must be!!! Not only are you in a way going through this with Bec but you are having to be strong for her while keeping your own head up!!!! Listen as I had written to Bec, God only gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers and y'all are friggin WARRIORS!!! Take time out to let it all out cuz we can't b strong all the time! Mental health care is super important! Much love to you both! Hugs n prayers!!! ✌🏼🧡🙏🏼🌸🌺💪🏼
<3
I love it! Fantastic!   🙏💞💋Take care see ya next time!
Although your room is gorgeous, Oso stole the show🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I was peeing my pants with his couch rendition! "Going with the couch"
Much love to both of you. Prayers for strength and comfort during this difficult time. Much love from Pennsylvania❤️🥰

Thank you so much for sharing your life with us. You both are great and so inspiring!  Much ❤️
Circular Wood ?? 😂🤣
I just want to give you and Bec a hug. You are such a great man; I feel many men should look at you as a role model. Good men are there, but you really take the cake and you're doing an awesome job!
Eamon is a cyclist amateur? You zwift? Whats your ftp?
We love you Eamon and Bec! So happy to see your faces! Your vlogs bring me joy  and you two are such beautiful souls ! Praying for    comfort, strength,  peace and God's  healing love for you both. The space turned out beautiful as always,  good job!
Parts of this video reminded me of my family's own home movies ❤
So great seeing you up and about Bec. You will be back to yourself very soon. Kudos to Eamon for being your rock. Nice work on the house.
I hope the round steps aren't  painful.
Prayers for you both, such a sweet couple and think of you often. Hugs and healing thoughts!
I was so excited to see the video from you.  Glad to see so many family members, Bob, of course, but every one.  The cone on Oso (I hope that is spelled right) was hysterical as was him wanting to be on his sofa.  Video was great...room is wonderful.  Bec looks beautiful and your personal message was very moving.  You two are in everyone's heart and prayers. ❤❤❤❤
Your doing great Bec your so strong, Ive got three weeks of my treatment left to do, still thinking of you each time I go and send you healing prayers from the UK❤
Continued prayers for you both during this journey.
Nice job on the renovation but sorry the pup stole the entire video lol.

It was so good to see you on youtube again. My husband and I were worried. We're still sending love and light. Stay strong!
❤️
Love this transformation. Great job Eamon, family, and Bec! Eamon and Bec, the love you show one another is truly inspirational. Thank you, Eamon, for sharing your heart. Bec, you are such a beautiful soul. Stay strong, keep listening to your body and rest. That’s your job. To rest and heal. Much love and prayers from Cochrane, Alberta.
Missed you guys so much!!!! So glad to see your smiling bad A faces!!!💜
Oh my gosh!! I love it. Bec that’s a great place for you to be zen with all that natural light, such a good idea with that space. Eamon surprises me every time with all those clever ideas🤣 I always love watching your guys’ videos, sending love always 🥰🥰❤️
Eamon, your feelings and emotions are super valid and understood. It's hard to watch those we love battle something so scary with a prognosis that is so undefined. And Bec, I am so happy that you are halfway through your treatment and looking stronger than ever! Much love to the both of you from Tampa, Florida ❤️. Also, that room looks amazing!!
Sending love ❤️ Amazing effort!
Thanks so much for sharing.  Much love & prayers to you both.  Puppy kisses for OSO

Love you two!! The room looks amazing, Bec looks amazing, and Eamon you’re a champ.
So happy to see you both !!! This is what I have been looking forward to seeing. So glad to see you guys smile too. Love that dog. What a personality. Didn't want that couch to go, that's for sure. Eamon , you are so great !!! Great for Bec and anyone who comes in contact with you.  Hope you two can do the weekly videos again. So many look forward to hearing from ya. No pressure. Love you both and I don't throw the word love around to easily also. Please take care of each other as you have been and I personally believe that this shall pass in time and your life will be less stressful with a bit of Loving time. I seem to be thinking of you both alot as of late and wonder how I got through my episode of cancer. Many times with time your brain forgets how horrible and stressful it was. Like having babies. If you did remember how much pain you went through with labor you would never have another. My first baby was over 12 pounds and had him natural.. I said I'd never ever do that again only to have two more sons. They are the very best things I have done in life. You will have your day with a baby if that's what you want in life Bec. Keep dreaming big too. That's a good thing. You will always have things to look forward to. Gotta run now but take good care of each other. Love you both. ☮️✡️💟☯️⚛️🕉️☪️✌️💕👍
❤️❤️❤️❤️.. love love love you guys.. my fellow amazing awesome Canadians.. Canadians are the best just saying 😉😉😉😘
Did we get permits this time?
Sending love, prayers and big hugs from The land down under. I start my journey this month. Love n Cheers ♥️♥️
Stay strong, I couldn’t image……. Love all your work and you will surely enjoy the new space!!
I did not want this video to end.  Praying for both of you as you go through this big trial.
really nice to see you guys laugh and have a good time and to see the doggo and his craziness with that cone. bec you look sooo beautiful I think you're taking on chemo so gracefully even tho its hard and tiring and sad. i have all the faith in the world that you will be healthy again sooner than we know it. love your coloring too. the porch looks so good and honestly looking at the house you guys did amazing transforming it in such little time. hope you guys are having a good day/night 💞
Caregivers are heroes! ❤️
Also screw love letters, get yourself a man like Eamon who will build & design an entire gym/yoga/zen room for you 💕
I bet that room smells awesome with that tongue and groove, love the smell of wood.
Gorgeous! Sending love your way 💕
One day at a time guys! Sending Reiki energy your way!
You guys are awesome, and made for each other......it's absolutely beautiful 😊😊 😊
I love how the two of you keep searching for those small moments of happiness 💕 very inspiring
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow!! It's so gorgeous!!  I couldn't stop laughing at poor Oso and his couch😂 Sending healing vibes ❤
So happy to see the both of you! Thank you for sharing.  The room looks AMAZING!!
I just want to send you both a HUGE HUGS to each of you. It is AMAZING to see the efforts you two are pressing through. I miss you two when you don't post. But I do pray to the God of Life  for strength & the  ability to maneuver through all the challenges. I smiled so Deeply to see Eamon's posting & Soooo Delighted to see Bec smiling & Coloring in such Joy. Loves to  Yous & Excited to see the building projects!🤗🥰😘☺🙏🙏🙏
wow the whole cabin looks great.
Amazing job!!!!!!  Bec you're looking great :)
so nice to hear from you guys again, I have been waiting for this update...I have gone through what you are going through right now...stay the course (whatever that means).  much love to the both of you.
Looking great Bec! You’re both a blast to watch and I absolutely love your dog. Impressive Room😎
Yes- keeping busy is good. I always think about you both and say prayers. Looks amazing and I laughed so hard about the couch! 😂🙏❤️
hugs to you both...hang in there!
*OSO - OSO - OSO*   . . . ANNND mic 🎙🎤drop stage exit left buddy cuz u SOOO owned this video!!   p.s. E annnnd B . . . you owe 'us' nothing . . . you never have to share things that you do not want to. I certainly hope all patreon peeps are still providing supports without the additional add-ons. That stresses 'me' out if you felt you had to create content for all such as well as these big videos every 2 weeks. Now back to re-watching alllll the doggo bits cuz he-be-too-fabulous y'all. p.s. Outstanding to see you laughing and dancing Bec.
I relate to this, because of cancer hitting my own family this year, too. So I wish you guys the best.
Holding you both in my prayers, Gods best blessings to you.
Your vlog made me laugh so much as Bear kept jumping on the couch. I was sick in bed with a chronic illness and I needed ur levity and humor. Continue to send prayers and best wishes.
Bec so good to see you. Have been praying for you every day. The room is awesome. Love the loft. Great work Eamon.
This is only the 3rd comment I have ever left on a channel, yes, all of them positive! I am so happy to see you back !! Yay!! 1st Bec you are amazing!!😉 I love watching your videos at the lake!! I am happy to see Tim there with you in your build! Eamon I love your love for Bec, you are a good stand up guy! I just had to stop the video and express how fricking happy I am you have a new video! I know your going through life challenges now & understand you taking time for you. Please just know my prayers and love for you all are so heartfelt. I have watched all but 3 of your videos, I have missed one since then. Stay strong, stay loving, stay true and most of all be blessed! Lots of support from Oregon!!
Let’s admit it, oso is the star of this vlog
جميل رووووع تسلم عيونك الحلوه مرحبا مليون
Who has been your rock Eamon try to stay busy and love the video your doing I think this project will help you stay blessed wow the shed looks good.
Oso and Eamon are so cute together! Both goofballs haha the perfect match 🤣 sending love to you & Bec ❤️❤️❤️
A family member of mine just got news that they beat stage 4 cancer after almost a year of fighting it. The best thing you can do is be there for them. Everything will be okay, much love 💖
Looking good the room and Bec!! Much love sending your way.
God's got you two , it is very hard to deal with cancer, it's a pain in the butt! Bec will kick cancer in the butt though.  Cancer free 5 yrs now! ♥️
Love this space! Glad Oso has the trampoline despite losing his couch!! Sending love 🤍
This video , as your others, did not disappoint. Heartwarming, encouraging, vulnerable and a heavy dose of Oso. Sending healing thoughts to you both ❤️
Sending you guys so much love!!
Sending much love and positive thoughts from your french speaking neighbors! ❤❤❤
BEC, you look amazing and I am happy to see you. Eamon, keep it up, you are doing great buddy!
The transformation is Amazing! And sending so much love and prayers❤️🙏🏻 By the way, you look so Beautiful!
Eamon 😉
Bec, hard to know what to say 😇 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Eamon you are being such a champ. Thanks for letting us in on the process, it must be so scarry and hard and all you can do is just feel the feelings!! You're doing great.  And Bec, your bald head makes you look like such a babe. Keep healing well, cutie :).
Hang in there, Eamon.  My father supported my mother when she was battling cancer.  It’s a roller coaster of emotions and it’s ok not to be ok.  You’re human. ❤️
Sending all our energy and love for your healthy recovery!!💕
Eamon you don’t owe us anything, neither of you guys do. What you guys are going through is so intimate. We appreciate you opening up and sharing with us the small glimmer of what you guys are going through. But you don’t have to, we respect any boundaries you guys put. & if at any point you don’t want to film and you want to take a moment to breath, we will be right here whenever you guys get back. No matter how long it’s been. You have created a community that will always be right behind you. But your mental and physical health is always what’s most important. Thank you for opening up Eamon, I know it’s not easy. It takes so much courage to be vulnerable, so thank you for showing that strength!
Great video and glad to see everyone, this video felt almost normal I really missed you guys and your fam!! Glad Eamon got to talk about his feelings, it is so important for people to address the loved ones who are closest to people going through serious health conditions ❤ you are both so strong. It is so beautiful to see how supportive and caring you are to each other as you go through this chapter. ❤️ thank you for sharing more of your life with us
We're here for you, Eamon. I'm sure it's extremely difficult. Bec, sending love to you. I hope you are okay. I admire your strength and positivity (both of you), but I know you can't be strong all the time. Some days, we just don't feel strong, and that's okay too. That's just as valid. It's real. Looks like you have loved ones around you for support, and I'm so happy to see that. You both deserve all the love and support. Big hug. Hang in there. You got this.
Love you both!!
What a great screened porch redo! It looks beautiful!  It makes me smile that you have so much support from your families and your amazing home.  Oso is the comic relief that makes me laugh! It is heartening to see Bec and looking so beautiful as wver. She always has such a great attitude! I feel you Eamon! I get what you are going through! My husband of 50 years had a massive stroke and is paralyzed on one side. He had gone to see his sister who had fallen off of a ladder and broke ribs, vertibrates and stitches in her head. He is in a hospital , 10 hour drive away from home. I went to see him for 6 days, but I just got home again. He is still not stable enough to be released from the hospital, but he is getting therapy already and if we can get him back up here, he will be close enough for me to see him. But we have lots of angels around us as it appears that you have angels around you! We want Bec to get better and completely recover, but Eamon, you have to take care of you! Having projects and family and friends around you is a Godsend!  You guys are an inspiration and an encouragement too! Thank you for this video! I loved it! 😍❣️❣️❣️
If you don't get Oso a new couch right now!🥺
Tag me when Oso drops his ASMR channel
So glad to see this video! Awesome job on the room, Eamon AND Bec! Bec, you look beautiful! Oso (sp?) is such a great Dog. Three Champions living together! ❤️
Bec made the choice to take the strong road. Eamon I hope you found some solace in being able to open up the way you did. It is such a joy to watch people who know what they are doing work. And it was such fun watching Oso and his cone. Best wishes to you. Being in that amazing environment can only fill you both with healing.
Hi guys glad to see you Bec is lookin good 🌷Eamon has his work cut out for him stay blessed
You two are such beautiful people love watching your videos
YALL GOT THIS
Love you guys!
coloringggggg! it’s the best! great job, Eamon! it’s just lovely! I’m thinking of you both all the time, so was glad to see this vid! ❤️❤️
We love you two SO much!!! Bob and the whole family gang. What a workout room, I'm coming over! Tahoe, CA love ❤️ cheers.
In the same path.  Praying for you both
You two together are unstoppable ❤ hugs. xx
Love and hugs to you all from Missouri. ❤️
Oso 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😘
We're love you Bec and Eamon.
Omg Oso and the couch! Best thing I’ve seen in ages!!
Oso trying to leave with the couch had me laughing so hard. Keep fighting Bec and Eamon, your strength is so inspiring 🙏🙌
Sending so much love and support! I find your videos so up lifting and they always bring a smile to my face! :))))
Such a perfect little family. I'm in awe of you both. Sending all my love!
I think you need to give Ozo an official credit. He was brilliant! Loved the episode and relieved yo see Bec up and dancing with you. ❤️ Also, your dad is getting younger. I want to purchase AG! But I can't find the link...
Not,
😘😘😘😘😘
Sorry,sure how to spell y'alls dog.name
Such a fun video 😂
It was so great seeing you guys back on YouTube.  We missed you so much.  We have had you two in our prayers.   Praying for healing and comfort.  I think Oso is good for you.  He was funny when you took his couch.   Probably a good companion also.   Take care.  We love you guys.  🥰🥰🥰
Oso was the star of the show in this one. Loved seeing you all again 🤗
Eamon being a caregiver is incredibly hard and exhausting. I've done it 3 times now for loved ones and all I can say is being able to be by their side, fighting with then and for them is time I would do everyday. I hope you take your time to rejuvenate yourself too. It only serves you best and Bec too. You have to put your oxygen mask on before you can help others. All the love to you and Bec! You're an incredible couple before chemo so we're not surprised the strength you've carried over. ❤❤❤
Praying u 🙏as u get better...,just seek JESUS  as u diMin Cheryl
Only 10 minutes in and the majority of this video has been Eamon trying to wrangle Oso 😂 we love to see it!
Love you Eamon and Bec ....... Together you both can do anything❤
Eamon and Bec always love watching y’all vlogs. Your cabin and all its surroundings are beautiful.
Oso was not giving up his couch that easily! Lol! The front room looks great! To more brighter days. You guys both hang in there!
What a wonderful video.  You both have been missed!  The cabin has become the perfect sanctuary!  Enjoy with all your loved one
OSO was the star of the show. I was laughing so hard when he kept jumping up on the couch. He was trying to give his opinion, he felt that was his comfy place and why are you taking my couch. You are so lucky to have him in your lives. What a lovely being.
stay strong…praying for you! 🙏🏼🤘🏼

Sending love and support from Western Australia ❤
Love the new space x love you guys 🥰🥰🥰
I dont hear echo either
Love & Light <3   Good to see you smile : )
love that Bec is going natural without a wig! Very beautiful and refreshing to see someone "showing it like it is" and rocking her new (temporary) look while she has it. ♥
Eamon, what an awesome  conversion. It would inspire me and I don't like to exercise. Bec, you looking good.
Sorry, but Oso stole the show in this one! 😂 what a sweet pup. Xoxo
Thank you so much to both of you. Your a inspiration to many people other then me. Thank you for being open and honest with us. Thank you for sharing this journey we didn’t no was coming. But you guys have taught me behind every dark cloud is a rainbow. 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Holding you both up to the light. 💜
Inspiration…. To me that is what you both are! Last year my husband and I feel like we became part of the Eamon and Bec family. We have laughed, cried and generally feel like we have become to know you as a close friends/neighbors even though we’ve never met you. Two weeks ago I went to my local salon and cut 12 inches off my hair ( told my beautician I was dedicating the cutting of my hair and getting bangs to Bec…. ALL 12 inches). I donated it to wigs for kids with cancer. Bec you are beautiful!  I know people tell you that but truly you are beautiful inside and out. I know how as a female you feel your hair defines you, I’ve learned thru you that it doesn’t. Last week at work was Women’s History Month…. We were to tell our peers the woman who inspires us the most… I did a power point on you and Eamon. I told my peers at work how strong, positive and courageous you are and how you inspire me to be a better person. I’ve never met a more powerful or strong couple and all I have for the both of you is admiration. Eamon you are Bec’s rock. I want to thank you both for opening up your lives and sharing such a powerful time with myself and everyone else that times in every Sunday to what’s new. This world needs more Eamon and Bec’s.  Oso is definitely a keeper!  Much love and continued prayers for you and your family. #MoJo 2.0
OMG I have missed you both so much!!
I want someone to love me as much as Oso loves that couch lol
You guys are always in my thoughts. Continue to stay strong and positive... I just feel in my heart that you'll both come out the other side of this stronger and your future will be beautiful.  Much love to both of you from here in New York ❤️❤️
Prayers and hugs to the both of you.🙏💕
My thoughts and prayers are with you and Bec, Eamon. I have missed you both.
You both rock in all that you do and it is awesome to see each of you giving support to each other God bless you  both
*AWWWW😓 Poor Guy, your awful lol You're terrible....The dog obviously loves his couch, how Dare You Eamon?*
We're here for you Eamon! we love you and we love Bec and we know she'll come thru! ❤️
So good to see you both on the video! Love Oaso too, he is such a cutie! Prayers for you both, I will be celebrating 12 years of being cancer free next month.  Your positive spirit is huge!! Keep smiling!
Good to see you back-Blessings Bec-sending love.🥰😍🥰
Coincidentally, The Indie Projects are building a sladder and railings very much like yours.
Eamon, Bec and Oso....mainly Oso. Not all heros wear capes.
You are both awesome people. Brighter days are coming for sure!
https://youtube.com/watch?v=ENCdHz0jgJY&feature=share
I nursed my mom ... I used the STOP method .. Now if i just think the word  i can shift focus.  ans destress a bit.
The room is wonderful.  Eamon keep your head up. Your doing an amazing job supporting Bec. But just remember you are allowed feelings too. You can tell Bec, let her support you also.
Thanks for the update.  Those cones of Shame are worn to, and from the Vets office in my home.  Not dealing with them any more!!
Hold on tight you are models to follow the beautiful days are close!!
Since 2009 my New Years resolution has been to “Celebrate the Small Victories”. You have to celebrate them big and small. Eamon, you are such a strong rock and support system for Bec and others, that it is infectious. You inspire me to get more done then I believe I can and I am better for it. Thank You for all you do. #FCancer #SpeakUpForLee #CelebrateTheSmallVictories
So nice to see you.  Often think of you and send prayers and happy vibes
Both of you guys are amazing people❤️
https://youtube.com/watch?v=c3zab37JjbA&feature=share.  Please look her up
<3 <3 <3
The room came out great!  The post with moving the couch and orso made me laugh. He was really attached that that couch. Lol Glad to see Bec is doing well. Hang in there Eamon. Thinking of you also & know it's not easy on you to be strong for you both.  You both got this!
It's nice to see you guys are trying to make the best of your good days and that you have each other and your family are very supportive during this unpredictable time of your lives!
❤️❤️
Love, love, love your porch room.  Love, love, love all of your smiles🤠❤️.  Love, love, love your Bear!   So marvelous to see the two of you again.  Daily prayers🙏❤️
Thinking of you both often ♥
Dude, I have been watching you guys for a long time.   I think that was your best vid ever.
You two are so Precious. Thank you for sharing your life with us even when it’s hard. I had no idea I could care so much about a couple of buddy’s I’ve never met but here I am thinking about you every day and sending ❤️ your way.
Hopefully you give your dog another couch.  It was the best laugh I've had in a while.
Oso and the couch, need I say more! Eamon and Bec, your awesome.
Thank you for giving this video. Especially your heart to heart about yourself Eamon. I had to be just as hard on you mentally as it is on Bec altogether. But as long as you have each other you can and will get through this scary situation. My prayers are with you both. And hugs and love to OSO... Love you three.
Just a few of my thoughts watching this video.   Oso - such a great dog. A beautiful boy. Are you fostering him or have you adopted him? I hope this is his forever home because he’s perfect and clearly loves you both. It’s great you’re giving him such a good life.   Eamon - thank you for opening up and sharing. I know for some people that’s difficult. It’s good to see the vulnerability. You are a great role model for anyone supporting a partner through a difficult time. You’re doing such a good job and I want to send you love and strength. 🤗  Bec - you look amazing. You are amazing. You’re just such a beautiful person inside and out. You’re an inspiration for all who get to see you. Not just for others going through a similar trial, but for everyone. 💖I know we only see small snippets but none the less, you are truely a blessing to this world. By the way, by not physically overdoing it and looking after yourself you ARE helping Eamon. What you are doing is working on health restoration. Before long you’ll be back to all you were able to do before. Your #1 job is getting back to good health and you are doing it!! Lots of love and strength to you too. PS if you haven’t already please research medicinal mushrooms. Perfect support for everything you are going through. 🤗💖🌻
You don’t owe us anything, Eamon. We appreciate hearing how you are doing, but understand the emotional place you are in. Take care of yourselves and each other, knowing that you are in our thoughts and prayers always.
You two are inspirational, and I admire Bec for being positive and determined. Sending lots of love from Jamaica!
💕👍👩👍💕
Miss u amon and bec always watting  your video  youtube
Much Love to you both!!! Great to see you! :) it's hard to see someone you love hurting and you can't stop it or fix it.. Just keep your eye on the endgame. You will have your girl back and she will be healthy and strong once again!  Stay strong!! You are her rock right now! Hugs!
Happy to see you both.
💕
Looks freaking amazing, well done Eamon! Sending you love from the Gold Coast, Australia 🇦🇺 Love you guys. Prayers for Bec x
Bec has no hair and is as beautiful as ever. After first look I didn’t see any difference, I only saw the same old Bec. As she said in the video, she’s “still got it!” Go girl!
And Eamon, you are a superstar!  Hang in there brother. Love you both.
So nice to see you all!…the love I feel for your situation is very real and strong!…you are a tough mother F…I love yas soooo much!…keep it up!..was missing you and in my thoughts quite often doll!💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️😘😘😘😘🙏🙏🙏
Aww I missed you guys sending lots of love from Jamaica ❤❤🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Good to see you both!
Speaking of building inspectors, that loft railing is definately not to code. Balustrades no greater than 10 cm apart. Not safe for the dog or future kids.
Buddy!!! We got your back.
Love Bec & you all my love & prayers 100% going to be all good 🤗😍
Legends true legends in all you do❤️👍😃🇦🇺
Thank you both for sharing your journey. You guys make me cry but also motivate and inspire  me to be my best self. Great big beautiful room transfromation. You guys will definitely treasure your time spent working out, meditating and performing yoga in your new room. Love love love the little loft. It’s adorable. Love you guys peace out and blessings to the both of you and your pooch. 💜💜💜
My heart is full getting to see you both again.  💕
Awe!!!! I was so excited to see you posted a video!!! Eamon you did an amazing job with the porch, as per usual. Oso  was looking so pitiful. Poor thing :( he’s so silly tho.  Bec, Im sooooo happy you are almost done with the chemo. You look so good!  So much love from fellow Canadians. Xoxoxox
Love you guys <3
Love you guys and keep you both in my thoughts and prayers.   Sending you both love ❤️
The dog is hysterical that whole scene with him and the couch was priceless.  What a star he is.
Bec honey you are such a beautiful soul. I feel so fortunate to be able to watch your lives on video. You and Eamon are such an inspiration to behold. I can’t begin to know just how difficult this journey is for you both, but you are both Rock Stars in my eyes. I’m a mom/wife/grandma and am just so amazed by everything you both accomplish. I absolutely love your vlogs and both of you. Your home is pretty amazing. I really hope you are keeping Oaso sorry if misspelled. He is such a great addition! You are both in my prayers. Love and hugs.
Aww...Bec.  we're all thinking of you.
Im so like you....ie dark places.  At 75 i have found there is always a light.  Stay active...it is who you are!  Bec will be fine.
Dear Eamon & Bec.  Great to see you.  Bec your father is very a very handsome man, hey and I'm hetero, just saying.  I see where you get your beautiful smiling face.  Love you guys, prayers to you Bec. We are all thinking of you.  Much Love.
Sending love to you both from England xx
Eamon: 💪🏼  Kudos to you Bro.
Love you guys!  Extra ❤️ to Bec!
Omg I love Oso! That dog is the perfect addition to your family! 💗
Hey Eamon and Bec I hope your feeling well because I know exactly what it’s like I’m at hospital right now finally after 2 years am finishing my last two rounds of immunotherapy (I have a Neuroblastoma) stomach tumour and let me tell you the road is tough and this might not work but you know what we will always keep fighting back I will keep you in my prayers and I will be fighting for you too because you have got this 💙💙💙
Sending love! 💕
Was excited to see another video of you two! Bec hope everything is going good for you! Keep Strong, and brave....
Reality bites
Great laughs with Oso jumping on the couch! He definitely wanted to keep the couch!
Nice space 👌
Sending you both love and healing. 💛
Always thinking of y’all! Even down here in Texas. Sending so much light and love
Hope you got a permit for the renos and kearned from that last mistake! XD
Glad to see you guys again. I have been keeping Bec in my prayers and you too Eamon. It is amazing to see how you vlog and your interactions with Oso. The couch scene was so funny. Gorgeous job on the porch area and so happy that Bec was feeling well enough to join in. Sending love and light your way!
I know what you are going through Eamon, I've been there, stay the course, stay strong.....
So glad to see y’all. I was missing and worried about you. Bec, you’re looking good and I pray all is well. Eamon, God has you both so hang in there but be sure to take care of you too. Sending prayers and love. 🙏🏾♥️

Congratulations for your new space, all my love and healing for your gays  From Australia Fabiola🙏😇👼🏻🌿🐬🦋💐💐⚡️
Eamon what a great job creating the little space of love for the two of you..Somthing you two can enjoy for all the season to come 😀 and definitely a space for Bec so find serenity and peace ❤
Oso came into your lives just when you needed him.  My rescue dogs rescued me too
Sending love and healing light.  Peace and blessings.
Get well soon
Oso getting on the couch is actually so funny 😂 he’s like “if the couch is goin, I’m goin with it”
Love you guys ❤ . You guys killed it with the entrance / gym / mini loft. Like always, you seem to amaze us with all your ideas coming to fruition. Thank you for still giving us context.  And with that said I miss you guys the past Sundays but you guys came through and gave us Joy, smiles, laughs made us cry, and back again to smiles and pure enjoyment. Nice to see your families dropping by. We have not forgotten about you two 😘 Still praying 🙏 ❤   Please remember 💖 "I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me." philippians 4:13 KJV   GOD Bless You and keep you safe. Love you and until next Sunday Funday!!! 😘 😘 😘
Love you guys!!!
Hey darlings! I was wondering where you went! So glad to see you!
Can't wait to see the full cabin before and after ! See far from now but it will be lovely to see the end result
Lol the dog dish cam
Love seeing all the Osso content 🐶❤️
Did you get a permit :)  for that awesome construction...  glad to see some smiles keep moving forward one step and a time..
Eamon, you would not be human if this didn't have an effect on you.  I have been there with a child.  And I watched the effect it had on my husband and told him the same. But you are strong and so is Bec.  And I will continue to send my prayers, good vibes and love to you both. 🙏⚘️🙏⚘️🙏❤
You guys are constantly inspiring.  Your positivity,  your creativity,  your humour, your willingness to be vulnerable, your love for family and each other.  Thank you for being you. Always sending nothing but the best for your journey Bec. and Eamon.
So good to see you two. Sending prayers and support. Love you guys💕
MY GOD - how can one video make me laugh out loud, ugly cry and feel so inspired all at the same time!! You guys are amazing, Bec you look absolutely stunning, Olso, you’re the funniest and Eamon what a guy you are - keep doing what you’re doing!! Both of you should be so proud of yourselves and thank god you have each other. Always thinking of you all the time - so much love for you all ❤️xx
I felt so much watching this!!   Laughed OUT LOUD too many times at Oso/Bear and cried hearing Eamon be raw and real and seeing Bec so vibrant and positive while respecting her body and limits.    That is an amazing make over!  You did an amazing job!  I honestly DO think of you two a lot and wonder often about you and hope you are well and doing okay.   You've definitely touched my life and heart.  Continuously sending love,  prayers and good vibes to and for you from the southern United States (South Carolina).  <3 <3 <3
The space is beautiful!  Awesome job!  Love both you guys so much and sending you both positive thoughts and prayers and much love!  Keep the faith!
❤️
Looks very nice.. Happy to see your both doing well.
So good to see you both.  It's a horrible and difficult journey but being positive makes such a difference to the healing process for both of you.  The porch/gym/yoga studio/getaway/entryway looks fantastic 😊
God bless you guys you’re always in my prayers
Oso is the new star!!  He is amazing.  The couch bi had me laughing so hard.
oh i love the OSO Cam. You are wonderful Eamon, love you bud.
Beautiful work and happy to see Bec energy coming back. ❤️
I couldn't stop laughing when the dog kept jumping on the couch.
Good to see you both back! You got this! ❤
I just loved this video. Bec is amazing! Seeing her try to work through her weakness from  the chemo is inspiring. Oso/Bear is soooo cute (I want a buddy just like him). Seeing your families rally around you two was heart warming.  Fraser could be your twin.  Eamon you are a beautiful man.  I can only pray that my daughter meets a man a good as you one day.
You are both truly amazing people and are so lucky to have eachother.
Is the permit guy still sniffing around LOL?
"Wait, what is Tim Kaine doing at Eamon and Bec's place?" Don looks exactly like Senator Tim Kaine. I thought it was him.
Eamon you owe me nothing but I owe you a bunch for sharing your life with us. Glad to see things moving along.
Praying for you both to stay strong and for everything to work out better than you can imagine. Sending you healing thoughts Bec. ❤
Bec that tramp is awesome for flushing and pumping lymphatic system. You probably know but check out rebounding. I had malaria really badly 7 years ago and I jumped the crap out of my body.
Coloring is great for Bec!!  I do it a lot in my older age.  Lack of energy too.  Keeps the mind busy also.  ❤
Bec you are still super hot woman, congrats Eamon.
Watching Oso reminds me so much of our 100 lb black lab Frank. (he's passed on) but the cone situation with a big dog is a joke. Lol. He would ram it on stuff to break off on purpose. Was hoping for an update today. Thinking of you all as you navigate such a crappy situation. May you all stay strong & resilient.
My eight-year-old daughter and I watch you guys all the time. So many things about this video were awesome: seeing all the family love you have surrounding you, watching you turn that room into a friggin zen workout retreat (!), and of course, the beauty of you two, Eamon and Bec. Eamon, being a carer is difficult. Take care of yourself just as much as you care for Bec. Bec, seeing you is always like a breath of fresh air. It's like sunshine. I hope you're doing okay. I also hope you know that there is no obligation at all to share your story and your feelings, but it does help others who are going through it to know their feelings are mirrored and validated and they can talk about it too if they need to. Lots of love from us!
Love you guys!
Love You both, and amazing job on the porch/gym studio. By the way is there any winter merch available still?????
You both are rockstars! Continued healing prayers for Bec! ❤️
That room is boss! Eamon you did a great job with that space! Bec, you can rock a bald head like nobody I've ever seen! You are so damn cute! Prayers up for both of you!!
Great job Eamon looks wonderful. Bec you look beautiful as ever. Your both still in my thoughts and Prayers. Sending lots of love and Hugs ❤️
Sending you both so much love! That room looks amazing Eamon! Your vision is perfection 😍
I so understand Eamon.  You need to let it out though.  I watched my husband go down with cancer.  Sometimes you need a break away in order to regroup and help yourself.  I wish I had taken more breaks.  Maybe get Bec's parents to come in and give you a break.  Being a caretaker is a very important role.  We had a 13 year old daughter right in the middle of it.  Take care of yourself too Eamon.  It is very important.  It will help you be strong.  Let it out.  Those tears are helping you with the pain and watching something very hard with the person you love the most in your life.  Tears do not make you lesser of a man.  Tears make you strong son.  ❤
You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in You.  Isaiah 26:3  Continuing to pray for you both! ❤️❤️❤️
Your porch is beautiful! Just like the two of you. You both are rockstars. Bear is such a cutie
Eamon good to see you keeping busy so you don't go crazy. Bec I loved your Black hair because its my favorite color hair but I have to tell you, you may want to keep the bald look because you are so incredibly beautiful right now! Eamon just thinking of your next project, two words Zip line.
Soo happy to see you guys back 🌟you’ve been missed my sundays havnt been the same hugs to you both hang in there ❤️
P.s. can Bec drink the athletic greens when she is nauseous? I am struggling with my stomach and pancreas (for years) and suffer a lot of nausea. I want to try it just not sure I can keep it down?
Forgot to say that Eamons dad rock even though he is Canadian ;-) I dont hate Canadians at all it's just when it comes to hockey....Jeeee i know Gretzky was a ok player to ;-)
Awwwww So GOOD to See You Guys Again!!  We missed you! YOU are Beautiful Bec! and Eamon!  Amazing job on the reno ! Sending Love and Light and Miracles and ... enough sleep XOXO
We love you guys! You two are so strong in such cool different ways. Things suck and I’m so sorry but I know you know we are here for you!
You guys are doing everything JUST RIGHT!!! When the going gets tough,,, the tough get going. Admire so much your industry. In hard times I have often found refuge in creative, constructive tasks. It encourages positive thoughts and belief that better days are on the way.  BUT THEN you already know that!!! Bec looks beautiful.
I gotta tell ya I really love watching the dog.sending love and good vibes to Bec, Eamon.
Thank you for making this video. Eamon, thank you for opening up, being vulnerable makes you grand. Beck, sweetheart, you’re a warrior. Lots of healing light your way! The place looks amazing!
1. This is a terrible situation you have been facing.  But you're doing amazing. 2. You don't owe anyone anything. This is your time to accept and take in support.  Situations like this are humbling because we realize we can't control it. Accepting it and doing your best is all that is required.  Having bad days and being angry at cancer is totally acceptable. It is part of the process. It is not a failure to be upset. It is a healing course, if needed. You're right Eamon, it is very hard to watch that. I've lived it with my mom and a few friends. You just jump in and do what you can and know it is valued. Seeing someone suffering and not being able to fix it is a challenge.  It is hard to hear it when they can't feel good or happy. You have to be able to compartmentalize that out of the equation.  And take it step by step. You'll get to the other side. You both love each other and is evident.  It will carry you through if you both take care of yourself.  Hugs. Nice to see Becca have a few good days in between the rough spots. You're a trooper Bec. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh man Eaman sucks to see you hurting like that, its really cool to see you willing to open up to strangers really but seems like things are heading the right way keep your head up better days are coming your way soon!
I’ve been missing seeing your videos every week. I’m glad that bec is doing well and is half way through kimo.🥳 I love the loft and love what you’ve done with the whole cabin. Thanks so much for getting another video out I loved it.
Sobbing through every emotion watching this. Sending so much peace and love.
A million prayers to match your million subscribers. Congratulations And very good work. Youre lucky for that familia support.  Missed Bob😍
Love your vlogs so much!  Sending you all so much love and positivity!   Can’t tell you how much I loved seeing Bob!!
So lovely to see you guys surrounded by your friends and family - it’s so clear you have a whole heap of love and support (and you deserve all of it!). So open of you to share how you are doing Eamon ❤️ for the record, neither of you owe anybody anything - share what you want, or don’t, just focus on you ❤️ sending lots of love xx
Easily the best YouTube couple. Thank you for continuing to create even when times are tough. Seriously, you guys deserve the world. Cheers!
I have followed you since before you bought the cabin and the progress has been incredible - Thanks for coming back onto YouTube - I don't follow Instagram so was worried about Bec and Eamon.  Tough times are for tough people - and you two love one another to get through anything.  I've missed you both and hope that the radiation is soon passed and recovery is going to come quickly.  I also loved all the support from your families - they obviously care so much about the two of you.  Hugs and much love.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So glad to see an update.  I think of you both as you walk through this difficult time. Love and prayers.
Didn’t think I could love this channel more, but then comes Oso! What a character! Big hugs and healing vibes! Much love💕
Love to follow you guys, i think about you every day, take care Bec. I Hate to say that i like you guys since you are canadians and i am a swede ( best national league ever, salming, forsberg(best hockeyplayer ever ), sundin and the ex vancover twins. Think Lunqvist in Rangers was ok to ;-). Anyway take care I love you even if you are Canadians... LOL
Amazing job’ so inspiring to give things a go ourselves in our home!
Omg. The dog is a real hoot.  Don’t take my couch!
So nice to have such great family members helping out how fortunate! Looks amazing! Love to Bec! 💪🏻
God bless you both. You are doing great. Taking dominion over your thoughts is it. Praying for miracles for you both. Love from Australia.
Oso needs his own show BAHHAHA. I love y’all! You’re videos are 100/10!! Love the fun guests!!
Sending lots of love to you both, and continued prayers…..Your doing amazing Bec, and hang on in there, And Eamon, your such a lovely guy, but your allowed to feel emotional too….I think, your doing great at keeping busy and what an awesome job you’ve made of the cabin….But don’t forget you need some rest too…..take care guys, and lovely to see you both xxxx 💕 xxxx
Room looks beautiful…from Southern WV shouting prayers for EVERYONE 🙏🙏🙏🙏💐💐💐💖💖💖🌻🌻🌻🌈🌈
Good Vibrationzzz
You have both been on my mind daily….sending you healing thoughts from PEI… I always look forward to your videos, especially now as you go through this ordeal. Much love to both of you.
How wonderful that you have been doing it well even though it is not an easy moment. My prayer for you in any needs and health care. And yes your activities do provide a needed purpose and passing over the challenges as well as you can... a motivating always makes the day more pleasant 🙏
So glad to see a video.. made my day
The fact that you kept it real, shared,as usual, every bit of the room rebuild including the frustrations and the love and family support through it all made this an amazing vlog. I laughed out loud at your silly, lovable dog and cried right along with Eamon as he expressed feelings that are impossible to explain. Haven’t yet figured out how I can care so deeply for people I’ve never met but know that I send all my love and support your way, always. ❤️
Sending prayers and love for you both,I'm glad Bec is feeling much better.lobe your dog as well,from South Africa
Excellent work !!
great to see you both.  love you guys!
Well done! It looks great 👍 Glad to see Bec in good spirits & Eamon, of course we're sending you love too...way to be a rock for Bec.
Well done!! Bear is the sweetest dog!!! Eamon it was great to hear your honesty about everything, it’s hard on both of you. Can’t wait till Bec makes it through !!!
I love how the dog helps carry the couch. I've missed seeing you guys. Hugs to you.
The workout room is gorgeous! Love the transformation! Take care guys ❤
beautiful transformation of this spaace! it looks amazing
Vet assistant here! If he’s not licking his privates you can honestly leave it off him but some people use this one that looks like a neck pillow that might work better if you absolutely want to keep it on him :)
Awe give him his couch back!!! Hahaha pivot!
Please share that yummy recipe!  Lentil marinara????
Good to see the porch get the face-lift, to match your cabin reno! 👍! It will be a good place for many times to come!
Wow I've never seen a dog so attached to a couch so much before, Orzo the couch hound... Bec's dad...'they make my shoulders look big' genius 😍 Love how all the family are there to help you and Bec's out,as it should be. As someone who's ill myself and how helpless my husband feels I understand how hard it is for you Eamon, but know even though some of us are hundreds of miles away from you we love you both and obviously gorgeous goofy 🤪 Orzo.  Much love from the UK 🇬🇧 ❤ 😘😘😘
Your dog is hilarious riding the couch. Eamon staying busy is very important for your mental and emotional health.  Keeps your mind from spinning in circles. Bec you look amazing girl. Continued prayers for you both and your families
Tim 👍👍👍
Oso needs an inflatable dog collar. Much more comfortable than the flimsy plastic lampshade.
Your design and aesthetic taste is lovely - especiallyCompared. To your Utah counterparts
Great job you guys!! 🙌
Love you both so much! Keep the faith, each day is a step closer to health. SO glad you guys have Oso and all your family to smoother you in the best ways possible. And gdi Eamon that is a SEXY workout room, congratulations!
If, I’ve learnt anything at our lowest points good things will happen. Keeping busy does help but, talking about also it good. I had my knocks and bumps but, I found peace through music and focusing on the right things.
Beautiful work, Eamon!  Blessings to you both. <3
You're a top bloke Eamon and Bec is so lucky to have you by her side ... so tough for the both of you but the bounce back is going to be fantastic !  To happier days ahead 🍺
Know that we are crying with you Eamon and praying for you and Bec.  Prayers coming your way.
Love you guys!!! Sending y'all much love from South Carolina!! y'all are so tough and im so proud to be a part of yall's journey thank you
💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Sending all the positive vibes and irish luck I can your way! You both are amazing people who deserve every ounce of happiness and health! Everything will be okay ❤
I literally was looking yesterday for a post or a video. Oh so thankful you guys are ok. Sending so much love.
Aww Eamon, you broke my heart when you shared your feelings!! Your doing so good buddy and Bec would appreciate that sooo much!!  Lots of love to you both ❤️❤️
Amazing job. It turned out fantastic!!  Sending all my love to you both! ❤️❤️
Love you guys, sending lots of love and good vibes from Brazil 😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰
for Bec 🙏❤ for Eamon ❤, for Bear ❤, stay strong and have a great group hug
Wonderful to see you both. The room looks amazing 🙌 sending you love and hugs ❤️
Oso on the couch....priceless! The love Oso has for Bec is so apparent! They both have such sweet souls!
Beautiful space you are very talented Great job 👍
Dump the cone lol it's a freakin nightmare. I lost half my furniture and plants day one and the cone came off on day two. I just supervised them and slept on the floor on an old mattress rather than see them struggle like that. Have a rotti and a Cane Corso who both had surgery thank God not at the same time. My back paid the price of sleeping on the floor especially given that most of it is held together by steel (never catch a fainting overweight woman!) Take care!
EAMON, as a young cancer Survivor I understand completely where you are both at. I would encourage you both to keep communicating with each other, even those difficult dark thoughts!  Would be more than happy to chat. I think about u both daily just now. Keep strong ❤️
❤️
That room is gorgeous. I love watching all your videos because it's all genuinely done, with all heart poured into it. We'll keep praying for both of you. Stay strong both of you. Oso made me laugh so hard.
Wow, I love it and the beautiful home you’ve built! What a perfect place to heal! As always I’m sending love, peace, healing, positivity to you both and Oso! ❤️❤️❤️
Comfy Cone
Keep strong, you’re both doing great 😊
✌🏼
Praying for Bec and U. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just jnow we are all thinking and praying for You, Bec, and Oso. grntle hugs to all
Sending tons of love, prayers and healing vibes to you BOTH from Beautiful British Columbia.... Thanks for letting us all know how you are Eamon through all this
Love from Ireland. 💚. Mind yourselves. Eamonn you take care you are Becs rock but you need to take care of you as well. Bec thank you for sharing your journey
It is not easy to express feelings, whatever they may be. These digital platforms, which are often invasive and even defeatist [there are many people who are only well when expeling venom], can also be messengers of love... you deserve all the manifestations of affection and hope... a hug from Lisbon, Portugal - EU
I fricken love you guys so much. Sending all the good vibes your way. We love you.
Osso is quickly becoming the star of your videos. I have been cracking up watching him!
So so glad to see you back 💞
It was soo good to see you both on camera again. Missed our weekly dose of Eamon and Bec. Oso has such a funny personality had me in stitches when he kept jumping up on the couch! Also destruction derby with the collar (lampshade as I like to call it). Sending all our love and well wishes ❤️
I am so proud of you both! Eamon you kept positive and busy and built something to make your lives more enjoyable and nicer! Bec, your fighting harder then ever just to get through every day and to do little things!  That’s a huge drastic change and I know it’s gotta be hard/frustrating, but hang in there. You’re doing amazing girl! Your staying incredibly positive and upbeat and are such a fighter!   This stuff hits close to home to me. My very good friend was diagnosed with breast cancer about 11 months back. She is 33. She found a lump the size of a pea, called her doc for an appointment, in 48 hours it grew to the SIZE OF HER PALM! It’s the fastest growing and most aggressive form of cancer you can get. Went through a ton of chemo, a double mastectomy/reconstruction in one, and is now doing radiation. She too is so positive and I’m truly blown away by and inspired by her and you. Saying prayers and sending positive healthy vibes to you both daily!    Thank you Eamon and Bec both for taking us on the ups and downs of your lives together! You touch so many lives you aren’t even aware of!
Love love you both… you are amazing and the bear too xxx
Every time I think I can't love a new section of the cabin any more than the previous ones - this 4 season room is AMAZING!!!!  So happy to see both of your smiling faces this week and still sending you constant prayers and love!
Love the room and continuing prayers for both of you.
So fucking adorable
What an amazing transformation!  Wishing you guys all the best and continued healing Bec. Love from BC!
looking amazing, wishing you both all the very best from down under.
So happy to see ya'll! I've been worried! I know that's crazy, but Bec has been in my thoughts and prayers for the last couple of weeks.
POOOOR OOOSSSSOOOO!!!! He LOVES that couch!!! LOLOL
This video had me cracking up! Oso reminds me so much of my german shepherd, he's hilarious! Love to you all <3  i also need to know if uggs make Bulgarian split squats better thnx
You two and your family and oso are just beautiful and amazing 👏 ❤️  I bought your cookbook but haven't received anything 😞
💐🌞
What a beautiful video. Eamon I am so proud of you for opening up about your experience with this process, cause honestly it is a whole different kind of difficult. We are truly here to support you both. I am glad you have such amazing family and a goofy pup to keep the spirits up :)

sending you both all my love, support, & hugs. you guys are incredible.
You are an amazing man Eamon.  Lots of love to you ❤️‍🩹❤️
Love, love, love the video, update and transformation! ❤
That was the funniest thing with the couch. You may need to send in to a funny video show.
First you take his couch away and then you put that contraption on his head! What kinda parents are you?? Ha! I love Osso. I also love you guys and pray for you every single day. Much love.
It was so good to see you today!! Wow, great job on the room 👏 as it looks like the perfect space for yoga and more. All the love possible to you Bec - so heartwarming to see you smile. Xxx 💚🌱🌱 also, I wanna visit and ice skate on that lake! ⛸😂😂😂😂
That’s a beautiful room! Glad you’re both doing well.
So great to see you both today. Great job on the porch! Sending lots of love and healing hugs your way. You’ve got this!👍🏼🙏🏼💖
Bec I know exactly what your going through I had cancer when I was little and I got through it in the end with all the support from family and friends and I have faith that you will get through this
Awesome reno love the cushions/bed in the loft🇨🇦
OSO loves that couch!!! I love that! <3 Thanks for making us smile!
Eamon, you owe nothing to "us"... You owe it to *yourself* to open up and let out your pain, your fear, your anxiety.  You're doing everything you can for Bec, and the rest of us are here to keep you strong. 💛
Bec, you look beautiful.  Eamon great job on the gym, it looks awesome.  And omg Oso jumping on the couch was so funny  Sending prayers and love your way
Your dog is a giggle in every move he makes.  I am praying for both of you, Bec for a special gift from God for healing and you to be able to deal with this.  You are strong you can hold her up and she will appreciate and need it!!  She looks great!  She is strong!
Blessings to both of you!  Be well.  ♥️
OMG i cried laughing ...........sweet pup!
Eamon, you have the strength of Superman and bring Bec into your power shield  ❣️☮️❣️💟❣️✝️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Eamon I really appreciate it that Bec has a partner to be her rock. We never have control, never! Only God. Idk if you believe in god or not but he's in control. You are in our prayers and thoughts. Thank you for being such a great supporter. 🙏❤
You both are so amazing!  It's unbelievable that with all your dealing with your still thinking of us and putting out these amazing videos.  Thank you we care about you both so much and we need to see your ok , no doubt in our minds you'll both be back to your actives selves in no time. Amazing says it all. Oh and Oso was begging so hard to save his couch. He's a great addition to your family.  In our prayers always
It's awesome to see you keeping yourself busy and healthy. Love to you both <3
Hang in there, there are people like me caring all over the world. Keep busy keep your chin up and you will get through this. We have all had troubles and you are getting through this !!!!
Oso and the paint reminded me of my cat and paint. Several years ago, I was painting my apartment. I thought I was being careful but kitty still found a way to walk across the wet paint can lid. She stopped to lick the paint off but then started foaming at the mouth. I heard this "gloop, gloop, glooping" sound as she walked around. I went to get her and, of course, she ran, lept over a basket of laundry onto the bed.  I caught her and called the emergency vet. Thankfully, she would be fine. Just needed more water and less food for the next few hours. Hugs and love to you both. ❤️
Sending love and prayers from Ohio.
Sending lots of love and light your way...
Beautiful room!! Great seeing you guys💛🌻🙏🏻💛🌻🙏🏻
Put duct tape around some of the rim of his cone to deaden the sound. It is so loud for there for them. Especially when the walk into crap none stop.
Love you guys so much!  So glad to see a vid from you.
I'm so happy to see you guys again.  Eamon, you're the man.  Bec, I'll continue to send you positive vibes from sunny Florida.  ❤❤
Bec you know we are here for you.  You are a rock but today’s message is for Eamon.  It’s okay to feel upset.  I took care of my dad with cancer for 10 months.  It was tough but I knew as tough as he was I would be just as tough.  You are not forgotten in all of this.  You are amazing.  It’s okay to have your sad moments.  Trust me I have been there.  Keep your faith and both of you fight like hell.  Be true to yourself.  It’s ok to cry, laugh, shout and show every emotion you feeling.  Remember this.  We are all here for you.  We love yeah.  ❤️❤️❤️
Everything looks amazing as always, you guys are an inspiration.🖤🖤🖤
Sending love and prayers to you both. It's wonderful to see your families stepping up, and to see your deep love and support for each other.
Eamon, your so loved.   My heart broke watching you today.  I can't imagine what this has been like for you. Your love for Bec, speaks volumes of you as a man and as her other half.   Bec, you are my hero.  Your strength going through this,  gives me strength to endure what I'm going through as well.  I prayed for a partner to be my cheerleader,, unfortunately in walking this road along.  I do have family and the are everything,  just like yours,  wow, your mom, dad and brother are amazing. Love both of you so much. I pray for complete healing for you.
Eamon, I am going through the same with my sis and I am the only support that she presently has.  It is really tough having no over control the present, let alone the outcome.  Of course I send Bec love but I am feelin' it for you.  Hang tough.  We got this.  P.S.  LOVE that Spurs sweatshirt!
great, great job. sending love and healing thoughts from western canada,

Bec, you got this; you are a strong girl. Eamon, i feel you; my wife went through breast cancer 3 years ago. it is very tough on her and on us. But, i know in heart you guys will make it. Sending all my love
Animals are so smart, Oso knows the deal... What a cutie
Thanks for the update! I was wondering how it was going. Your porch is beautiful!
It is very tough on the sick person and even on the care-giver.  Know that you are being great.  May the Lord bless you both.
Always love to see how you guys transform a space, absolutely beautiful! Big props to Eamon, that weight section is stunning 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  Continued prayers for both of you. Thank you for being vulnerable Eamon, it takes a lot to do that. And Bec, thank you for being a continuous light for all of us. 🌺
Someone, please send a nice big couch like dog bed for Oso!
That room looks brilliant 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Thanx Eamon for sharing how ur going too; and Bec, it’s so good to see u again & looking so good & positive…that goes for both of u, God bless 🙏🙏🙏

You guys have know idea how happy I was when Eamon popped up on my Instagram page  this morning saying that there was a new video,  I have been waiting to see how you guys are doing, I miss you so much.  Eamon you are amazing!!!  You guys have this your going to be stronger after this is all said and done.  Bec I cried when you came on,  You look great and it so unfair that you are just as beautiful with out hair.  You guys did an awesome job on the new room.   I know you guys probably wont see this message but if you do. I wanted to say thank you to Bec, Last week I got some not so good news on my health and even though it is scary and going to mean some changes in my life it's OK. It's nothing like what you are going through but it is concerning, I just want you to know that while the doctor was going over everything with me and scheduling an ultrasound, the whole time even though I was scared  I just kept thinking I got this, I can maybe even change this.  We will see I have my ultrasound this week.  Bec you send a great message to everyone and you let us know that it's ok to be scared but you have to find the positive and face it.  I love that you have family around you,  I call my sister everyday  and my son and my husband just said it's OK we will figure it out.  So I know how important that support is.  Please know I am sending you both love and healing energy.  And I don't know if Oso is staying or not but I really hope he does. He loves you guys so much and he is too funny.   Love from a fulltime traveling family from the United States.
Looks so great , my first time to watch you guys.  How did you think to specialize each storage area? The sunglasses WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
Hello from Greece. So  glad to see you again (i dont know why but i worried about you) Sending you my good energy and waiting to see you again soon. KALINIHTA (gd nigh in greek)
Wonderful  job.on the reno
That room looks amazing, well done. And Eamon for sharing your feelings. You are amazing 🧡. Bec, great to see you up & about and as strong as ever. Sending positive vibes your way always ❤. As for Oso, hilarious 😂. Lots of love to you all x
You guys are amazing!! I am praying every day for both of you .
Love to you both and what a great family you both have.  Stay strong and positive.  Half way through and there’s light at the end of the tunnel.  Glad you shared your thoughts and feelings too Eamon. Sometimes the partners are often forgotten about.  Love and prayers to you both.
Sending you both lots of love. I appreciate you sharing how you’re feeling, Eamon. Thanks for being vulnerable <3 The porch looks AMAZING!
So good to see you. Hang in there!
The room looks beautiful,  like your in the swiss alps!! And sending all the love and healing prayers for you B.... 🌻🙏🐶🌻 xo
Eamon, wow... that room looks AMAZING! Your attention to detail and design is great. And I love the wood you chose, it looks very Scandinavian. Congratulations. Regarding your struggles with staying strong for Bec, I was in your shoes 11 years ago when my partner went through BC. It's tough. But you will get through it. I promise. For me it feels like a life time ago now. And so good to see Bec up and about and being her usual cheery self. And how nice to have such a loving and supportive family to help you in times of need. You are both blessed.
Great footage of Oso. Funny dog! Eamon, you are doing great. Keep good thoughts going. You both will get through this and will put this behind you eventually.  There is so much for both of you to be grateful for, so keep in the gratitude mode.
Oso said nope not my couch. Lol! Bec you are awesome! Fight like a girl!! Love it ❤
sending lots of love to both of you 🥰
So happy yo hear from you guys agian!
Thank you both for being so vulnerable and so real with the community. Being content creators can i’m sure be far from easy and putting your life out there is so hard i’m sure. The love I have for you guys and this whole community grows with every video! Peace and love to everyone ❤️
I’m so glad to see you both doing well!! The porch looks incredible. Great job Eamon!! Bec, you’re looking beautiful. Happy to see your fun loving spirit. Stay strong you guys!!!❤️❤️❤️
Prayers for you both and your family 💗💗💗
Shame on you guys. Took his couch and his balls 😂
Love to see how it's working out the room is looking great, sorry to see two nice people like yourself to have to go threw something like this.
So glad to see you two STILL GOT IT And good to see how dedicated zones is to love  Even if it is a coach...  You two do well in the love department  so great to see the family support  Ramon your word to us all were touching  can't help but be rooting for you  and your challenges as we watch you  rise to the occasion every time Bec... You are a treat you are do show  that strength in your Challenge of knowing  what you can and what you can't do  I am indpired! Best to you ad all and to your friends  And family and the love the share with  You all  Ohso..you are a Trip Thanks Guys
The space looks great! Wishing you both all the best :)
Much love you guys! You done hit a home run with your extended room. Keep on keeping on. Osos is very mischievous he did not want the couch to go lol. 🥰❤🐾👊🙏
so good to see your faces..we're all behind you ♥
Linda again. The room is awesome. Organized♥️
I love your coloring 🤓
So happy to watch your video today. Great job on the reno. Love your dog. You two are the best! So much love to you and your families.
In traumatic times some of us come to a standstill. But not you guys and I really admire that. I love to see you smiling Bec and Eamon you’re a strong wonderful supportive partner. Sending love and good vibes your way. Keep on Truckin 👍🥰
So good to see Bec is up and around and managing with her treatments.  Bec, you look great for having gone through all that, and Eamon, you are a very good man and loving husband with a great sense of humor.  I will keep you both in my prayers.
I know how difficult this is for you and Bec.  My husband fought cancer for three years.  We went through chemo, a failed self-stem cell retrieval, a new trial drug (worked for a bit) other treatments, a few close calls, finally hospice.       People often don’t know how hard we as care-givers, hide our fears and worries and neglect our own health, so we can be strong and be there for our Love.   You both are often in my thoughts and I look forward to seeing Bec well and healthy.
sending all the healing love your way Bec
Thank you so much for sharing your world with me. I'm on a cancer journey as well, and geez, what a ride. Sending out love and energy to you both and your dear families. And that boy, Oso...there's nothing like a dog to get you through. I've got my Penelope Pittstop rescue pup right here beside me for the licks and cuddles. xo w
Never put in a storm door? Eamon: "Hold my Athletic Greens . . . "   I'm sorry if it's weird to say this, but it's just really good to hear your voices today. I'm sure your whole community is the same . . . no one wants to put pressure on you, but everyone wants to know how you're doing. You look tired, Eamon, and you don't owe anyone shit. Take care of yourself. And Bec, you are a warrior princess and you are beautiful in every way. Total girl crush here. Coloring is so Zen, and your color choices are beautiful. I went from coloring to designing my own simple canvas cross-stitch, and it's amazingly meditative. Hugs to both of you.
❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼
🛐⚔️✝️  have you guys in my heart and prayers . Les  envío un abrazo  espritual  .
You're such a beautiful being... 🙃😊😘😊🙃
We are need love , we area human. Much ❤
Sending hugs and love 💞💗 great looking space! and yes, Eamon is super clever and great at this building/handy stuff - so fun to watch how he finds random pieces and makes them useful (ladder). Oso and his couch was the saddest and funniest part of the video. Poor puppy. I vote to get him a bigger bed!
I love Oso! Did you guys adopt him or is he another foster pooch?
Love to both of you. Amazing work on the entrance gym!
Love the colouring and beck you look great and amen
You guys are amazing!
Oso not wanting to let that couch go had me rolling! 🤣 Room looks incredible also 😍
So great to see Bec smiling!! Never lose your smile and hey, it seems like you both make a huge progress. Hang on, buds!! Greetings from Munich, Germany 😊
Did you get the building inspectors out of you hairs? Prayer for continued healing and. Good health
Awesome transformation!
Hope u got our permits this time - don't need the extra stress / scrutiny
💙💙💙
Love you guys x
I was wondering how long before he figured out how to get it off.... My dogs would run into the Walls and undo the Velcro
so happy and relieved to see this video.  I kept looking for the next one and hoping all was well enough.  Bec looks beautiful and how many people could say that with no hair.  Wonderful work on the room, great job.  So happy to know that chemo is half way done.  Can't wait for the finish line.  take care
I love you both….
Cracking video! Lovely to see Becs up and about. Brilliant DIY project Eamon. Take care both of you. Xxxx
We love you Eamon! ❤️🇨🇦
You got this guys!! Love both of you!❤
The room is wonderful, Eamon you did a GREAT job!!!!!  You to Bec!!  Ya'll take care.......love and blessings.
Relieved to hear Eamon open up about how hard it has been. Stay strong for each other. You are an inspiration. Best wishes from NZ.
Love you Eamon!🌻
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
💚🌷💚🌷💚 sending Hearts and Beauty to you all.  You are in my thoughts so often tons of supportive and healing thoughts coming your way.  Extra hugs to the furry beast too - he is a hoot.
❤️ you both from Nova Scotia!
Love u guys missed u guys loved this video

Proud of you back big love coming your way you’re doing great halfway is the rumor but really because your attitude it’s like your 3/4 of the way done because you’ve been doing so well and that is another benefit again I’m just so proud of you I’m sorry it took me a while to say so I’ve discovered it’s OK to say I’m scared I was afraid to check in       Read the viewers all love you so much and we’re proud of your action and your ability to recognize when it’s time to rest this is important tons of love best of luck kiss kiss
Eamon you are a rock star. For both the renovation work and for opening up about how it's been for you. Sending love and positivity
Praying for you daily!  Think of you often and keep looking for update videos.  Was so excited to seed the sunroom/exercise room transformation!
I'm so happy to see Bec smiling and with so much  enthusiasm... your looking great.  You both have been in my prayers. Stay strong Eamon,  for Bec and yourself.  All my blessings
You make such a great little movie! And that AWESOME DOG OSO!  The cone! 😂
Sending both of you guys so much love. Eamon, you did an amazing job!
Love you Eamon & Bec, and love the amazing new entrance porch/workout room, and Bec colouring is so mindful isn't it!  Thinking or you both, it was great to see you and to have a catch up with you Eamon.
Eamon, you don’t owe us anything, but thank you for being vulnerable. That was brave. I know all too well how hard it is to see a loved one suffering so much and how hard it is to talk about it. I’m praying for you both. 💚💚
❤️❤️❤️
Linda here. Sending high frequencies of love healing and compassion. Love you dearly ❤
Eamon and Bec, so great to see this video. You are both in my prayers. Sending you love. Sending love to Oso too.
Safety glasses dude
Bec is so brave but she is so lucky to have you for support. Before you know it this will all be in your rear view mirror stay strong. ❤️
OSO made me laugh so hard. He's got quite the personality and it was so sweet to see him love on Bec. My thoughts and prayers are with you all, including your extending family. By the way... great job on the remodel!  I give it a 2 thumbs up! :)
Oso and the couch was hilarious!  Your home is so beautiful, with everyone's hard work.  Happy to see Bec doing well!  ☺  Bec  you are beautiful inside and out! Thank you for sharing your journey. Your sharing will help others deal with their fears and anxieties. Eamon it's hard to see a loved one coping with health problems, letting family and friends will help lighten the load. Letting  others show their love and support for you both.  Much love and prayers to you both & families. 💕 💞 ♥ 💜 💙 🧡
Yes. Next level.
Send healing prayers. Love what you done with the place it look so nice 😊
So proud of you guys,your just amazing 💕🥰💕🥰💕🥰
I’ve been checking here and on insta for updates and was so happy to see your post this morning. Great job on the gym! Eamon you always make everything look so professional. Oso is just the cutest big ball of fur ever! He has a sweet personality, beautiful eyes and loves you both so much 💙🐾🐕. Eamon my heart breaks for what you are going through watching your buddy go through something so difficult. Like you said, you don’t have any control. I’m thankful Bec has you as her ROCK. Bec you are handling this very rough time in your life with grace and beauty. Only someone who has been through it before can truly understand and that isn’t me but I’ve had loved family that has dealt with cancer and watching them has been hard. Prayers for you both to find strength and comfort to get through this. 💛🌹☘️🙏🏼
You are two of the most beautiful people I am privileged to follow…with gratitude and love you kids.  Blessings always in all ways.  ✨❤️💚💙💛✨
Beautiful couple ♥️ Eamon your amazing and Bec your beautiful inside and out! Stay strong guys xx
glad to watch you guys, sending love always! Happy Sunday <3
Sending warm hugs :)
Love what you all do I cannot even hit a nail in a piece of wood!
Loved seeing Bec up and about. Pray the healing continues to go well. Oso on the moving couch was epic!
Love both of you! Still praying.
Grace of Endurance!!
Sending love and healing vibes  your way guys. Watching you every Sunday from Massachusetts.
I just looooooooooooove OSSO he's such an adorable bumbling baby boy <3
oso & the couch was spectacular. you have a bunch more patience than i, my boy didn't spend even a day in the cone, couldn't take it. i guess if he had been interested in his sutures, i would have had to put it back on. the reno is amazing as is anything you guys do. so happy to see you this sunday, you've both been on my mind. love from massachusetts ❤️
You have no idea how much I’ve missed you all! Hugs and kisses from Texas!
Light and love and healing to you all. ❤️
YOUR BOTH AMAZING!!! AND the work out room turned out beyond beautiful! ❤️🌻🌞💗🥳🤗🥰😁💯⭐
Your tiny speech almost got me. Want to hunt you down guys in Kingston.
I was so excited to watch this video.. Keeping you guys in my prayers!!
Loved this video and seeing you guys are keeping your sense of humor throughout this difficult journey.  The part with Oso and his couch made me laugh out loud. I certainly hope he's getting to go visit his couch occasionally. 😆   I've also never been able to move furniture without saying PIVOT. Glad I'm not the only one thinking it every time I'm moving bulky furniture.   Looking forward to seeing more of your great personalities shining through upcoming vlogs. Beautiful work on the yoga studio Eamon!!  You guys are lucky to have each other.
It is so nice to see your smiling faces again! Eamon, I know this is a trying time in your life. I admire that you are Bec’s rock! You have been so wonderful for her! But it has been so hard on you. I’ll keep you both in my prayers!
The room looks amazing!
What a guy you are Eamon 👍🏻
Beautiful job .  Bec you look amazing . I know I’ve told you I’m praying for you . But, I’ve been checking every Sunday for an update . No pressure at all . It’s just so good to see  you looking so beautiful, and stronger. I’m sending love, thoughts , and prayers . I pray for you every time you cross my mind , which is often . ❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻 Eamon, I’m not sure I’ve told you I’m doing the same for you . You are such an amazing husband . The only thing worse than being sick., is watching someone you love fighting a sickness . You are doing an amazing job !  You’ve been in my m my thoughts and prayers as well. Sorry if I didn’t tell you that . God has y’all it’s going to be ok . ❤️🙏🏻 from Mississippi
Looks amazing 🙌 cheers to good days ahead
Hugs to you Eamon. Hugs to all of you. This is not easy for Beck or anyone around her that loves her. We are all here cheering both of you on. Much love to both of you. xoxo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gosh guys! First y'all take Osos' couch now his special parts.... Im thinking its time for a GoFundMe to get Oso couch back. 😭
Oh my god you guys are the best
I saw you guys a few times on my YouTube before I really started watching... I’m so glad I started religiously watching, Bec, you inspire me to be a healthier and more grateful person. Thank you a million times. You guys have more people than you know waiting to hear updates! We all love and care for you both. All of the healing vibes sent your way, I’ll be here every step of the way even though you don’t know me! Stay warm 💙🦋
Eamon... opening up in the dark hours is perfectly fine!   You are a big support and you do positive work!  You 2 will come through this!  And we will be there to speak motivation :-)  All the ways!!
Eamon, we are never really in control and after years of thinking I had it all tied down I found I didn’t ……. When I finally gave it to God he opened the door to peace and answered prayers!  Love you both so much and you are in my prayers♥️🙏
Your strength throughout all of this is incredible! Oso does an amazing job of bringing joy and fits in so well with both of you. Sending love from Aus <3
Those washers!! Lol. You are awesome Eamon!
Bec, I really admire you for sticking with your chemo. You should be very proud of yourself. I will be sending prayers your way for the best outcome! Eamon, you're support for Bec during this time is really very admirable! Way to go! Also it never ceases to amaze me how talented you are in all the renovations you have been doing. You are really great at everything you have done. I think it's really fantasticic of everyone that has been helping you. Kudos to all of them!. May God be in all of your lives & bring happiness & good health to all! I love you dearly, Your friend from Seattle, Roger
What an amazing outcome as it’s just lovely and cozy!   Glad Bec could help a little as well.  The coloring projects are beautiful!  Your sweet dog needs a bigger bed to stretch out for sure - he didn’t want his couch to go!!  So cute!!
May God continue to bless you guys...this is a tough battle but we know that You two are very strong even in the hardest of times
<3
Xxxxooooxxxx
Great job!! That looks amazing 🥰
🥰💕🥰💕
So glad to see the support from your families. It was good to see them all. Loved Bob's cameo. Good to see Tim too. Thought Tim was going to end up with Oso when he took the couch away. It's good for Eamon to keep busy because you need to take care of yourself too. It's like on an airplane they say to put the mask on yourself then you help those with you. When my hubby had a brain tumor removed we were a team. You get through it together. That awesome room will help with both of you with your mental health. Your cabin paradise was what you needed at the right time so you had that home base to feel safe and warm. Oso just adds to the healing for you both. Eamon is so clever with his designs and ideas he comes up with. He has that vision of what can be when he sees a space and it is special not everyone has that. Bec love the coloring cooks. I have some and it is so relaxing. Soak up the time to heal with your family, Eamon and Oso. Keep dancing you guys it was so lovely to see.
Oso, at the water bowl, with that $#@&+/ up cone. Thank you.
Love you both so much. Great to see you. You are both such stars. I am so proud of you. You are under such pressure but are doing amazing. Bless you. 🥰😘❤
Extremely well done!
Love you both! Sending you lots and lots of love! I💕💕
I LOVE the work you did on the porch - what an amazing makeover!! Great job! Thank you for updating us on how you both are doing ❤️I know I am a stranger to you, but I care about you both and wish all of the best for your futures. Beck,  hang in there girl! This will all just be a bad memory in a few months and you will be feeling so much better and free from chemo. Sending love and prayers your way. 👍❤️
Oso is pure magic on camera🤣🤣🤣♥️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wow, I’m blown away guys on the before and after room enclosure with a loft. Fantastic!!! Awesome job! Sending my love to both of you. 🙏❤️
You guys are rocking.  Hang in there.  One Holy day at a time.💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏
You guys are amazing, inspiring and motivating in all sense of the words. Thank you to Eamon for opening up a little and allowing us to feel and know some of your thoughts and emotions. Bec, keep smiling, it lights you up. Keep up the good fight, but remember thru it all to ask for help and support when you need it, u have an amazing family and your YouTube family are here also xx💛
I am soo impressed with how much you guys have done to this cabin. Its absolutely inspiring. You two are such a great team and it show how much you really have a love for each other and for the cabin. Each project you guys do is done with love and everything looks amazing!!  Thank you for being so real and caring for each other soo much.
Doggo so sas about the couuuch 😭
EB
You two are awesome. Thank you for keeping us updated when you can. Love the space and how everything turned out. Much love from Westren Canada. Keep warm. Stay Safe. Summer is on the way.

It looks amazing 🤩. Nice dance moves guys  🤣
Lots of love from Saskatoon, Eamon you rock dude and you are so inspiring.  Lots of love and I pray for you both everyday.  Hopefully someday we get to meet.  Go Canada 🇨🇦
Looks so amazing!
Love Oso such a character ❤️ what a great support dog to have! So happy y’all adopted him!
Continued prayers for you both and your families. 🙏🙏
Lol 😂 that dog 🐶 did love that couch
The porch/workout room looks amazing. So happy to see you both. Been thinking about Bec and wondering how she was feeling. I appreciate Eamon opening up on his well-being too.  Much Love to you both from the Apricot Capitol of the World 😃 Tommiegirl💜
One day at a time guys , u both r doing amazing xo
Aww, so good to see y'all! And keeping busy is such a lifesaver, so well done Eamon. Also, so good to see Bec gorgeous face and being the badass chica that she is, rockin 'the bald'. Lots of good vibes, energy and love to my fav Canadians x. Ps Osso is pure comedy - dude needs his own segments x
OMGAWD!!!! I CANNOT STOP LAUGHING AT OSO LOL
Couldn't possibly love 2 strangers more! Thank u for just being you! I have been looking in non stop to see how you guys are! Please know you have copious amounts of love and support right here from your Youtube fans! 💜 ps.. Osso! You are a such a good boy!  Lol love him! ❤️  soo much love from your fellow Canadian 💕
Oh, what does AG taste like!?! Green drinks scare me 😀!! I'm willing to try it though! ❤️
That’s New porch/exercising room looks absolutely amazing you guys love yea lots
I loved loved every moment of this video. I can't wait to see the room in the spring. Beautiful job Eamon.  Feel better Bec. half way home. Good girl. you've both got this in the bag. &#@% CANCER!!!!!!!!
Love love love you ❤️
new space is beautiful and i see healing there .  much love everyone .
Eamon you don't owe anyone anything, but talking about it probably helps so do whatever you feel you want & need. Your both doing an amazing job, just keep doing what your doing & keep each other going. Ive been my wifes husband & carer for 20yrs (im in my mid 40's btw), just learn to take each day as it comes, dont pressure yourselves & take the small wins together 😎👍
Oso is hilarious!
Eamon it looks Great!! What a peaceful room!! Bec you're always on my mind sending you bunches of love you are beautiful and amazing Bec and I love you so much please kiss Osso for me I'm in total love with him  God gave us these Angel's for a reason to give us unconditional love and teach us pure love the best medicine you could have I love ya'll so much God Bless😘😘😘🙏🙏🙏🤗✌🤟💥🐕💥
Great work! Life may provide challenges yet you both are dealing with them head on. Continue to take it day by day. Try to find the smiles even in the challenges.
Great job Eamon 👏 love you guys ❤
God Bless you guys. Been praying for you guys. You will get past this ❤️
Was so pleased that you published this latest video! So good to see you both doing so well! You are my heroes, for sure! I think about you every day and send heaps of love and support vibes your way! I have a suggestion: For the last month (seems longer) I have been eagerly anticipating news from you and started worrying when none was forthcoming. You have much more important things going on than dropping videos ... but if you could share a little short something, (5 minutes?)  just to let us know what's going on and that you are OK. A month of not hearing anything was hard! I know you will do what is best. Again, love you guys ... keep the faith!
❤️
Absolutely beautiful! Well done. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Praying all the best for you both! I think of you often Bec and pray. I’ll start praying for you to Eamon! Wishing you both much  love and healing…
💜🧡❤️
Love seeing you both. Give that dog his couch back!
Loved loved this video!! So happy to see you building again and creating an amazing healing space for you both ♥️thanks for being so brave and open Eamon. So honest, raw and refreshing. Sending you both hugs and love 💕
LOVE the new room. Sending love and positive juju to both of you. Xxoo
Great video (as usual)! And uplifting too to see you, Bec, up and around and rockin' the pine panels! Eamon, you're a master at putting your new nirvana room together! Looks awesome! Poor Oso wearing his cone! Sending you all love and light!
You’re both so incredibly strong and have full support from this community. Sending so much strength to you all. And can we say that Orso upped the cuteness factor of this video. Oh and Bob too.
I made it through Chemo and Radiation about 7 years ago and I'm praying for you guys.  God really got me through it all and my family as well.  I had 5 kids at home and I am so thankful for life now.
Amazing job, also Oso is so freaking cute, those paws!!!
Happy to watch a new video! Sending you Bec a lot of love from Brazil <3 Eamon, you're a an amazing husband. I hope someday I could find a great partner like you!🥰
Happy to see you are both fine!
bec i had best friend she got breast cancer an she had me shave her head she  was so brave like you ,she used sing like a angel .it was sad when i lost her but now god has another angel her name was rachel  .god bless
This video was soooooo good guys.... I loved seeing Bec... I pray for her and you Eamon.  That voice you use just makes me laugh sooo much and your camera set ups had me rolling on the floor!!! Love you guys!!
I love you two.  Blessings sent.
Omg it came out amazing eamon if your bored come over to mass I need help at my house!!!!! Eamon an Bec you both are sooo strong an we are here for you both so good to finally see you both!!
It always amazing to see that you both transform everything you touch into something even more beautiful than it was before. So glad that we got to see an update from you both today, it always makes my Sunday so much better. Can’t wait to see some future b-rolls of Bec doing yoga in that space! Also thank you Eamon for opening up to us! You are both such strong and amazing people and I just can’t express how much you both mean to everyone in this community! Love y’all so much💗
Bec is so cute and I hope she has some good days coloring and picking on Eamon.
You guys are amazing! I love your videos every post! You are both loved <3
Love you guys, love seeing your family and friends, hope you know you are loved and cared about!
Eamon I can relate to those feelings of not having control I went through something similar when my sister who does not have a spouce  and I had to be her rock had  stage 4 pancreatic cancer . I had bad anxiety especially when I went to bed at night and the thing that worked for me was giving it to the Lord .For the scripture says cast all your cares upon me for I care for you .So I did and the Burden lifted and I had peace .I pray that you and bec will sense the over whelming peace of God through your storm as Jesus did while he in his deciples sat in the boat during a storm .
Love watching you two💕! You are both continuously in my thoughts and prayers🙏. No, literally! Sometimes randomly during the day I think to myself, I wonder how Bec is doing🤗💖. Love ya'll!
Stay strong! This shall pass💕💕💕 yesss stay busy and Bec keep resting🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 I can’t wait for all of this to be in the past!
Oso💜so adorable.  🌹🌷
Lol I can't stop laughing at Oso
Lol Bec, how many times did you watch the dog's water bowl spill part by cone head 🐾😍 aw, gorgeous but funny!
Sound has changed! That insulation made a good difference I think. Good luck with treatments.
You guys got this. You have each other and your community loves and supports you. Sending you both lots of love and healing vibes!!❤️
That looks good. Sending prayers to Bec. Keep positive thoughts. That makes a big difference. God watch over her make her strong and immune system strong and fight this cancer. Sending prayers and positive thoughts.
I am so glad that Bec is respecting her limits and taking breaks when she needs to without the guilt very important she rests and heals her body very proud of her she’s got this she’s a champ.  FIGHT LIKE A GIRL BEC!
I'm in awe of Bec, such an amazing woman x
Love to you both!
Great job on the room! Was there any thought of sky lights in that space for some vitamin D while working out or some yoga? The other thought, I've never lived in the snowy winters, but I'm always wondering about doors that open out. Your entry screen door wouldn't be able to open if there's an amount to stop it from opening. Big Hugs to both of you!! Aloha!
So glad to see both of you being so strong! Incredible to have all of your families around to support and help out!!! <3
Oso made my day! lol I love that pup! The room looks great, well done! <3
❤️
We love you Eamon! Your girl is a strong one and y’all are going to get past all of this stronger than you’ve ever been. Soon… VERY soon you’ll be ready and more than capable to accomplish BIG things in this life. Keep pushing!
y'all are AWESOME
Sending hugs to both of you!!
LMAO!!! THAT'S HILARIOUS!! POOR POOCH LOL
big love to bec, first of all. and secondly a huge thank you to eamon for filling us in on his own journey right now. big love to you, too. and lastly - amazing space you have created. wishing you both all the best - keep fighting!
ahh it's so nice to see a video from you two! always so inspired by you. sending my healing energies from İstanbul, keep strong ✨💛
Much love to you both, cancer is a rotten journey but the love and compassion you show towards each other will get you to the other side 💕
Love how Eamon tells the dog to 'watch out for the camera" thinking he is going to understand and obey. LOL
Does anyone know what oso's breed is, he's so beautiful ❤️
Osso is stressed. He lost his bed. I would feel the same.
You guys are amazing , such an inspiration. Just know you have support from all over the world. Even from a tiny country like Czech Republic 🥰 Loving Oso he is such a gentle giant 😁
I missed you guys. Nice Reno Eamon. It did not look like it was okay for your dog (Bozo?) to get rid of the couch 😂. I wonder how many cancer plants Bec is having in the house/cabin now 🪴 is it a jungle or a Forrest of plants? 😂 get well, greeting from a follower in norway
Bec, you're so beautiful inside and out. Eamon, you're kind, funny and a awesome companion to Bec. Lots of good vibes sent...
Thanks for giving us an update. We are all routing for you both.  I'm glad you took the time to tell us that it's a struggle for you as well as Becca.  I can't imagine how hard it is.  It's lovely to see so many friends and family helping. Xxxx
My prayers have continued for both of you. Loved the remodel! You did great!
That dog LOVES you to the moon!! Hope you keep him. Adorable.  Thanks for checking in with us!! Keep up the good fight!
Continued love, support and good vibes being sent your way.  Eamon, I could watch you renovating anything and be in awe of your talents.  The new entrance looks amazing.  I also wanted to say that I did shed some tears when you talked about how hard it is to see Bec going through this all.  My husband is also going through his own cancer journey and the chemo was very difficult on both of us.... in different ways.  Love to you both!!
you guys are so strong also Bec looks so good bald i just wish u guys the best and i will keep you in my prayers!!!
Aw Eamon don't make me cry 😢 we love you both so much ❤️❤️
Have waited for what felt like an eternity for an update from you guys. How wonderful a sight you are for sore eyes! I laughed out loud at Osso's antics and felt your hearts in the comments that you addressed specifically to us, thank you. Bec, half way there -- woohoo -- keep that strong engine running, girl.  The new studio entrance looks fab, such a great all-season room, ENJOY!  Until next, wishing you the very best, as always, from Oyster Bay, NY.
Love you guys! ❤️ Sending love from Portugal 💌
So proud to be watching and supporting such beautiful people but I also come to see that fantastic beautiful sweet baby dog OMG yes I am in love!! HAHA. I mean Bec could you be more beautiful???? Blessings.Missed you guys. Glad back
You have to call it Sunroom! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hello, Lol, Osorio wants his couch back. It's good to see Bec with a smile on her face. I am sending love and blessings to both of you.
How adorable of Oso kissing Bec's feet and then a gentle nibble on the ankle...saying I loooove you so! woof!   Great to see you guys championing through these times.  Almost at the finish line!!! Stay strong!
The room looks so amazing! I’ve missed seeing your happy faces every week, was a nice surprise to wake up and see a new video was out! ❤️❤️ wishing you both lots of love and happiness from Australia!
Awwww a dog and his couch! lol
Love to see you all working on this project together! A quote I live by (and hope comes across in good faith), "Get busy living, or get busy dying"
Keeping you both in my prayers.
Looks great guys! Did anyone say anything about all the room for activities? Not sure it will pass inspection if you don't.
Oh man your stealing his couch
Eamon I know I’ve posted this before but I was really concerned about you. I am a cancer survivor & my husband is very much like you and it was so hard on him because there was nothing he could do to help me. My treatment was just as hard on him as it was on me. That’s when he started gardening just like you said he had to keep himself busy and do projects and I really think it was what got the both of us through it. Of course there’s concern for Bec but we know she’s got this. I just know as a survivor myself going through treatment it was so hard on me to see how bad my family was hurting
Oso and the couch had me cry-laughing! 😂😂😂 Love you guys!
Love this video! Given the circumstances, it's the best of all that I've watched - which is each and everyone from the beginning of your wonderful journey.
Its so beautiful & love seeing Bec smiling 💖😊
It’s ok not to be ok. Stay strong! Wishing Bec a swift and speedy recovery!
Love you guys. ❤
Are you guys officially adopting the dog? Or are you still just fostering because he's home. You are him mom and dad.
It was sooooo wonderful to see you both!!! Been awaiting for any posts from you all. You’ve captured my heart a long time ago and I feel so honored for you to bring us along all your lives journeys. Thank you
You are both so strong and there for each other. Hugs to you both. Soon to be workout room looks great. Lovely place to work out and see the views.
I laughed out loud when Oso kept jumping on the couch. This whole video was awesome. Eamon is so creative and talented. What a brilliant room you've created. My eyes were filled with tears when Eamon was sharing how he's doing while Bec is kicking cancer's ass. And, it was so great hearing Bec's voice and seeing her beautiful face. Art therapy was very therapeutic for me too when I was going through chemo. I just so loved this whole vlog. Oodles of positive vibes, thoughts and wishes are with you always.
I would take 1000 bullets over watching someone I love in pain &NOT ABLE TO TAKE IT AWAY!!!!! IT'S HARD!!! Don't discount your feelings, they count also. Life can really be a Mo Fo sometimes. After this growth, you will have a new perspective on the world. Much love
Your porch looks amazing and motivating : ) God bless.  Really brave to be so open about how you guys are truly doing. You can lean on God in this time hey, He has broad shoulders. All the best to you and your family!
👏 So AWESOME
I missed you guys so much I’ve watched this episode 2x today! 😂. From one random long time subscriber to another random long time content creator we ❤️ the good, the bad and the ugly. Take your time and keep enjoying those sunsets 🌅        Smiles are contagious for all the right reasons 😊
Loves the rap & the dancing 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💝💝💝💝💝💝
Sending lots of love your way! You guys are amazing!
cone of shame new level .  ❤❤❤❤
Poor Oso!!!!! My couch!!!
Soooo good to see you Bec and Eamon also - the whole family there  - I've missed you all but understand - Pray for you and I love what you've done to the enclosed porch - that is actual room - done fantastic work.........♥♥💕 Bec's beautiful smile and Eamon 💕 for you being there with Bec and the love you have for her.......She loves you back for it all.    Thank for your time on the video sharing about what you've been through - 🤗
That dog is the star of the show, the couch episode was priceless. God Bless and be with you both.
Love the weight wall. Keep strong both of you. 💗
One day at a time .
I watch anxiously for a video or update from you both. I keep you in my thoughts and prayers and I even update my mom on how Bec is doing every time.
Bec your spirit is impeccable and Eamon, thank you for the comedic relief in licking Bec’s head like an ice cream cone 😂 sending love and strength!
Buddy, my husband is a fixer too. When my lupus flairs up really bad and I get really sick, he wants to “fix me”. He ended up super frustrated when he feels like there is nothing he can do to make it go away. He’s learning that he can’t fix this but there are things he can do to make me a little more comfortable. He is a silent sufferer also so I check on him even on the days when I’m feeling not my best. We have both learned to take care of each other the way that we can and it has released the pressure off of him some. He will always be a fixer but he cuts himself some slack now. I’m so happy that you two are working through these tough times together. It makes the rough times a little easier. Just a touch. With much love to you both and your families,  Melinda
It’s tough being the caregiver of a seriously ill loved one. I know this from experience. You’re doing great and I’m sure you are a rock for Bec. Be sure to take care of yourself and take advantage of your terrific family to allow you to have some “Eamon time” every now and then.
So great o see you both again!  Love ya and missed ya!
Eamon, hate you tell you this but those ladder rungs are going to hurt your feet.
Nice that yous are back online again..   ..ren'-vation looks good... 👍tidy, fresh.. Needs a couple nice trees .....vids are alot more fun with the dog....stay strong...keep the faith, lots of optimism
Bec I'm not just saying this to make you feel better I'm saying it because you truly are... stunning! I've always thought you were beautiful but you look simply stunning oh, I know you don't feel that way however all the love and support that you have is shining through your presence and you amaze me. By the time you read this you're done with this difficult chapter and getting your strength back. Don't worry about crying difficult experiences change us, they make us more empathetic and grateful and that is never a bad thing ❤️
So glad to see another video of you guys. I know this is a hard time but stay strong! We're all praying for you. It's a test and I KNOW you will get thru it! :)
The room looks amazing great job. Love you guys. Keeping you all in my prayers. It’s so nice seeing your smile Bec. Stay strong you guys.
It looks AMAZING!!!! I’ve missed you guys! Glad to see you both smiling and keeping positive 💙 Eamon, you’ve got to be one of the strongest people I know.
Love what you did with the sun room- it’s beautiful!!!  What’s the next project?  The basement?
OMGosh I  bet Bec was laughing when she saw the footage of the dog 🐕  when she got back! Are you editing, Bec? Sending huge 🇨🇦 Canadian good vibes  every day via England 🇬🇧
Tip for the doggos, instead of the plastic cone buy a (foam) karting neck brace it does the same job but comfier for the dog and doesnt get caught on everything 😉👌
Thanks for sharing your amazing work and love with us! So glad you have a supportive tribe to work with and to love you!!
Thanks BEC for the Friends clip 😘
What a beautiful transformation of that space.  Perfect for continued healing and health!  Sending so much positivity and love to you both. 🤗❤🤗
Wow awesome looks great  Love and healings 🥰🇨🇦
Eamon, You rock with raw beautiful positive energy! Love to you both!
So happy to watch your video. Eamon, Bear was hysterical!! I think of you both alot and wonder how the treatment is going.  You are both so motivational, and still so raw and authentic.  Prayers for strength,  peace, comfort and complete healing!
Bec you are so beautiful bald ❤️ nice to see you on the vlog!! Eamon your doing great job ❤️ you both xo
Bec you look beautiful....sending lots of hugs your way....Eamon you are such a good partner and support...stay strong you both have each other and that is what counts...
Sending all my love guys. I really admire your persistence to keeping things going despite life doing it’s best to bring you down. We’re all rooting for you both, wishing good health and happiness for your future.
Wow, we have been waiting 3 weeks to hear from you all, and you knocked it out of the park !  First, Becs, so good to see you sweetie, know you have been going thru quite a journey and we can still see the strong spirit in you !  Ok, 2nd, Eamon, you are a rock hard builder genius. You take your visions and you have amazing ability to visualize and make things happen and the new porch room is simply Rock tabulis. 3rd, You both have fab dab amazing family bringing their work ethic and enthusiasm and love to both of you, so kuddos to them.  And 4thly !  I have said this before to others and will share it to you Both...Caretaking is just as Hard !  It's about as hard as having the actual illness, and I don't mean to denigrate the challenges that Bec is facing, but Caretakers have to be strong for the care-takee, plus themselves, plus others around you. Trust me, as one in your shoes a couple of times, "Control" is the toughest thing you will face.  As a kinda control freak myself, I made myself crazy with trying to control everything...doctors..meds, foods, schedules, just the whole rollercoaster of everyday things, and finally, a very wise nurse educated me to the fact, that we can't control everything, no matter how hard we try and that this is perfect example of "pick your battles". Once I understood that and put it into practice, my attitude really changed and was better mentally for me and the ones who were sick around me, and she basically taught me to give myself a break...and give my loved one a break...it is a rollercoaster and some days are going to be good, and some days more challenging. And, that it is OKay, to admit when one is struggling, and to reach out for help and understanding...it is OKay for the caretakee to admit when things are not that great, and to give "them" as much control as they can manage - so example, Becs is not that hungry, but you want her to have nutrition, and you give her this Big plate of food goodies thinking it will be good, when all she can think is "ugh"...so you do it on a smaller scale, give her  small plate with just maybe 5 0r 6 bites that she can choose from...if she just wants ice-cream, again, give her some, on a small scale.  She needs to sleep the whole day away? Cool, let her, and just check in once in a while. Becs, when you want to be "involved" on the build and not really energetic to actually do much, just grab a seat for a bit and be the audience and cheerleader squad for the process. Small steps are important. I am sorry to go on so long here, but from what I went thru, I feel it is my mission to help others have a bit better time because of my own experience.  And 5thly, "Osso", that Pup came to you in perfect time to give you joy, humor and love 🥰, and those scenes of him jumping on that couch as you were trying to move it out, were the funniest, laugh out loud moments I have experienced for a long time.  Hang in there ya'all, and Keep Breathing 😘
Love it! Love y’all both!💕🥸
Hi Eamone, haven't had to try this yet. But use a pool noodle cut into pieces instead of a cone for your pup. Saw it on pinterest. Good luck, you also give it your all on your projects.  ❤️ to Bec.
That was so sad for Oso 😢
So nice to see fellow u-tube vloggers supporting each other (followed Zar for awhile) & the community in general quite inclusive! So happy to see you guys back, Eamon sharing his ‘stuff’, Oso being such a goof and Becs amazing strength and positivity. Luv, hugs & speedy recovery from the we(s)t coast 🥶🌧🐾🧘‍♂️👍❤️🏋🏻‍♀️🙏🏼
Sending love and prayers… God bless you! ❤️❤️❤️
Bec you look amazing.
So glad to see you both. Sorry to say the dog took the show though. He is so funny. Stay strong but be ok with expressing your grief and loss. Continuing to pray for you both.
I love you guys from the very bottom of my heart 💖 I want to give you guys the biggest, warmest hug - You are incredible! ✨  The new space looks FANTASTIC! 🤌🏼 Well done Eamon! 👏🏻👏🏻
I'm still praying for both of you. She will get better. Hang in there. Thats good that she  has a good attitude. Thats the most important thing in recovery and beating this thing.
The room looks so good! But it’s even better to see both of you in such great spirits. Stay strong! 💛
Oh my god  so is gonna need a couch replacement
So wonderful to see your smiling faces. Hang in there. This too shall pass...from one survivor to another. <3
Eamon, While you share this upbeat video, I know (from experience with similar) that you struggle in your heart for Bec and her cancer treatments... your love for Bec emanates from you... remember to keep faith and take care of your mental health...I appreciate ya man!  Bec, I'm certain I'm only one of very, very, very many who engage thoughts and prayers for your healing. I know (again from personal experience) that what you're going through with treatment, is to say the least, rough. But, please keep your faith and take care of your mental health day by day.  Also, please know, once again I'm certain many would agree, you are a very beautiful woman with a bright spirit that emanates from you... in this video when you were dancing I was watching your spirit... hair will grow back... never lose your beautiful spirit!  Love for you both!
Y’all are FREAKING AMAZING!!  I don’t know you personally but seriously just love you guys!!  Send all the prayers your way!!  Bec you are just beautiful!!  Ramon your pretty ok too😉.
Love you both. Love seeing Becs family ❤️   Porch/workout room/ studio  looks phenomenal 😍
So happy to see Bec having good days and smiling. Eamon, you are amazing. I have no doubt that your unwavering support is doing wonders for Bec during her treatments. I know it can't be easy on either one of you, but the strong bond of your love for each other will see you through. You are both always in my thoughts and prayers. Eamon, that porch makeover is to die for - what an incredible job. That is a space that definitely inspires some serious workouts. High five to you and to Bec for her contribution - brilliant job!! Love you guys.
You  do not owe us  anything    .    We are here for you guys!!  SENDING  BOTH  OF  YOU HEALING VIBES
Thank you so much for sharing 😘 😘 I was worried because there was no update but now that I see this video I'm so happy to hear from you ♥️♥️God bless you both 🙏🏽 🙏🏽 Keep on staying positive God is with you he will not let you down 🙏🏽 🙏🏽 💞💞
Me watching; ❤️🤣😅😲😅❤️😲👏🏽🤣❤️❤️
Awww Bec much love to you, Eamon thanks for sharing your struggles, much love to you. Oso/Bear trying to get on the couch, bless his big furry heart, what a love bug. He is just so loving and sweet. The porch room looks amazing, so bright and clean and organized. Your home is all coming together. Big heart love to all of you.
I really missed your videos and I’m so glad to see your. back. You guys are awesome and I’m glad you also have adopted a cool dog that fits your lifestyle. I don’t remember any videos telling how you got him or where maybe you can answer that question.
The cabin base come so far I love it
Oso is the cutest thing ever
Continued prayer for you Eamon!!!
New follower here, just wanted to say that I love you both and am sending strength and healing energy your way. You both are so amazing 😎
You, your family, and your friends did a beautiful job on the porch!  It looks amazing. Keeping the flooring the same was a great design choice. It gives continuity to that whole area. Bec, you have a beautiful head. Didn't see any lumps, bumps, moles, or dents. 😃 Eamon, I can relate to what you are going through as I had similar experience with my ex partner. It can test your emotions. That's normal. Both of you keep your chins up. Lots and lots of folks rooting and praying for you. I got a huge laugh out of the dog not wanting to part with the couch. Be well, be safe. See you soon.
<3
I was wondering where you have been...thinking about Bec and how she is doing...glad to see her and her progress and I really hope you Eamon have someone there for you too...you need the support also.
Great to see you both.  Hey! from New Zealand
Great Job
You’ve got this guys, stay strong guys we are here to support you.
Thank you for sharing your heart Eamon. Our thoughts and prayers are with you both. <3
Love you guys but you need to tell your paint store what you are painting. You need to be priming bare wood. Paint & Primer in one is a marketing thing for drywall over old paint. DM me if you have questions. Always available. 26 years in paint.
I just love u guys so much, thank you for being in my life <3  I am so fucking proud of you, dealing with your life like that. You are amazing, send you love ❤️❤️
Looks amazing and good to see u both prayers for both of ya
Eamon your skills are amazing! Great room! Thank you for sharing your feelings. It can definitely be tough to be the caregiver. Sending you both much Love and positive energy!
Your openness has been so helpful. My aunt is currently on hospice from breast cancer and this truly helps to normalize the experience. I wish you both nothing but the best and bright days ahead💕
This is a very difficult time for you both.  Great job on the new room.  Gotta say, this was one of your funniest videos ever with Bear jumping on the sofa.  Too funny!  Take care.
what an awesome project guys. it’s just so wonderful to see you guys. looking forward to see your beautiful faces in the next video! sending much love from germany .
Laughed so hard watching Oso, couch, pivot.  You couldn't have staged it if you tried!  Keeping you in thoughts and prayers for healing.

You guys rock! Sending Beautiful  content  out so we send beautiful content back….
Wow it looks so good. I always look forward to your videos. I think about you two often, especially when I sit down for a chaiwala chai, which is often! You are both in my prayers. I love you guys
Eamon!!!!! Eamon!!!!! Eamon!!!!! You really owe yourself not us! You've given us sooooo much, entertainment, lessons, fun, love and countless other gifts!!! It's time for us to give back. I really love you and Bec an amazing amount. If I could give you both my positive, healing energy in person, I'd be there today. I can only let it flow to you though the breeze and power of Love 💕😘. May beauty, healing, and loving energy envelope you both. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability, Eamon

I got so excited to see you guys have uploaded! You all are doing so much right now and I'm glad you've been able to work on the porch.  Glad to hear Bec's halfway through!!  Eamon, thank you for opening up. I can't imagine what it's like to be there and trying to stay strong. Just remember, we still are rooting for all of you. I'm really excited that this porch will be a gym too and you will at least have that outlet. Hopefully it helps you get through. Sending extra love!!
Thank you Eamon, for everything. 💜

It scares me a little when I don’t hear from you guys but I know you need time to yourselves through this journey. Eamon, there’s no right way to go about this, but I think you are doing a pretty damn good job. You two have an amazing network of friends and family and you will pull through. This too shall pass.
Much love to you both …many prayers
I’ve been thinking of you guys. Sending love and healing your way. Brighter days are ahead for you!! ☀️

💕💕👍
💛💛💛
So happy to see you both. Bec looks great, you are both amazing. Don’t know you but think of you often. Love and prayers❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
They have blow up collars (or can use the neck collars when traveling on airplanes); instead of the cone of shame.
You don’t owe us anything Eamon, and neither does Bec. We appreciate anything you do choose to open up about and we’re with you supporting you 1,000%. I’m sure you both sharing your journey has helped so many walking a similar path. The strength you’ve both shown is astounding and I’m in awe of you. We love you!! Great job on the reno!! 💛
Eamon is such a good husband! I’m glad Bec is feeling better.😃
Eamon...its so amazing. I know that this project helped to give you something else to think on and just use up some of that not so good brain thoughts and make it good thoughts. I hope you know that we all think you are doing so well as Bec's support. Its very very tough. I have helped my folks for the past 9 years through multiple surgeries and health crisis. We lost my Dad over a year ago now and I had let myself get exhausted as being one of very few helpers. So..going forward I have learned a very valuable lesson and that is.....if the carer doesn't care for themselves there isn't anything left for the patient. Good job :)
Both of you, stay strong 💪 ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️! You both can get through this. The four seasons room is coming along well.  Oso's cone should be called the cone of destruction...he bumps everything. Love you guys!
GO EAMON GO EAMON GO EAMON GO!!!!
❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Only one word AMAZING
GO BEC GO BEC GO!!
How wonderful to see you guys again!  At the same time, grateful you are taking time to do what you need to be doing for yourselves.  Eamon, being a caretaker to one who's not feeling well is heart-wrenching.  I don't know anyone who wouldn't take their loved one's pain on themselves if they could.  Love you two wonderful people.🥰  The sofa scene was sooo funny!
Thank you for being so open with us. You deserve all the love and support, I am sure it will be okay. Great filming and editing. Felt for Oso losing his sofa, he really wanted it to stay!
I love you guys! ♥️ So much love from Italy 💫
Eamon you made me cry, your both so amazing with each other supporting each other beautifully, thank you for sharing your tough journey with the bug “C”, much love to you both 💞🙏🕊🙏🕊💞, your workout space is stunning and the area for the weights sick xxx
Only one word AMAZING
The reno is looking amazing.  That is gorgeous.  Positive vibes for Bec.
I haven’t started the video yet .. I’m just so happy to see you guys !!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOVE seeing the family at the cabin with you guys! love to see your beautiful faces and of course the doggo!! y'all are doing an amazing job! sending prayers and good vibes your way!  love you guys 🤍🤍
Bec you look beautiful
I was so happy to see Bec in this video 😩🙌🏾 She looks so beautiful and more radiant than ever 😍❤️❤️
So awesome to see your projects going on, amazing to see Bec doing well and Eamon so supportive. I m sure you re both struggling, but your drive and love for each other shows and will help you both so much
Love to see you working on the cabin, though thinking of Bec all the time. Hope she is doing well, I really hope that thoughts and empathy can make a difference here. And for your pup- set him freeeee from the cone , we also did that with our clumsy Bernese Mountain dog and he did very well ! Love U3❤️
Put a full length mirror next to the weights 💪🏻
I am so glad to see your video! I often wondered how you both are doing! You both are in our thoughts and prayers! I can't even imagine how hard this is for y'all.. I just prayer for comfort strength and peace and most definitely healing over Bec body. Eamon, being a care giver is hard, this I do know.. but don't forget to take time for you! It will help you both. God bless you both and continued prayers 🙏❤️ Beautiful workout room
Beautiful. Lovely to hear from Eamon. He’s a work horse and a great guy. Bec looking fab and gorgeous as ever. Ozo is a hoot!!!
We need more Bob 🥰
❤️ lots of love coming your way..there are not many days I don’t think about you both, lovely to see you Bec, stay strong for each other and the love between the two of you..keep going..xx
Sending all the good vibes! Peace and love <3 PS. You and Bec owe nothing to anybody. Love always
Sending you all my love and positive vibes!  You both are such warriors!  Absolutely love the new gym space, so bright, and to work out with that view is amazing! I think of you often, thank you for sharing! Hugs!
It made me so happy to see your video this morning, and very glad to see Oso your hilarious dog. I had a good laugh for sure. He’s a keeper! Continue prayers and good vibes from Missouri!
but the couch?  Can Oso have his couch back please 🤞 I threw out our dog's favorite couch and he never was the same.  A couch to a dog is their best friend.  🙏 you give it back.  P.S. I finally got our dog the same model of couch but newer.  Nope, didn't work.  It didn't sag in all the right places. 🐶  I love you guys but Oso loves his couch ❤
Awww, that is some true couch love... how much harder could he have begged to keep it.??  Doesn't it always seem like as soon as a couch or chair finally gets perfect and comfy to the max... time for it to be replaced by a stiff new one that you have to be paranoid over it getting a stain...  no plopping down on it with chips n dip.
Excellent work! Love u guys
Hi
I truly understand the roller coaster you are on with Bec’s journey. Allow yourself to feel what you feel when you need to feel it. It’s okay to be angry, sad, vulnerable, hopeful, etc. Every day is different, hell, every moment can be different. But you will get through this stronger, more compassionate, and survivors!   My thoughts and prayers are with you. I think of you often. I went through this with my husband and an uncle last year.
I love you guys. Hang in there you’ve got support here! ❤
So good to see you working again and to see Bec up and at it! So proud of you guys!!
Love y'all so much sending prayers and love

Are you trained in joinery/construction?! If not, how do you do it all!
Just got to the emotional part of the video, very hard to see you showing how tough it’s been Eamon. Always had love for you both, your videos have entertained me for a long time now, I’m glad you feel support from this community, it’s the least we can do! Rooting for you Bec 💪🏻
Keep being strong Bec! You’re a goat! Eamon your construction vids give me a newfound inspiration to get out there and work on my house, hope you guys are doing great!

Wow wow what a beautiful family. God bless you all. Beck I know this is the hardest thing ever but your surrounded by ROCK HARD love. Aman  you are a true man. ❤️❤️❤️
You're a great man emon
So happy to see you two! Eamon, your heart felt talk with us was amazing. I’ve been where you are. It is difficult to see your loved one sick like that. You are handling it so well. Bec, you are keeping it real and finding things to keep you going. I LOVE your coloring. We’ve missed you these last few Sundays. Great seeing all the support you have too. By the way, how is Oso doing without his couch? That was hilarious 😂.  See you Sunday!
I love hot country
Wow, what a great place to relax, but also to work out. Love the new work out and healing place. Also seeing all of the beautiful sunshine and sun sitting. You both are each rock and looking great. Sending so much healing light and many blessings. Hugs
Ok you hit it out of the park with the crunch wrap! Thanks for your great sharing. Love to you!
I love Both of you so so much, and just remember all of the people your helping, because I know you have always really helped me
Amazing job on the porch renovation, Eamon and family! I love the cozy loft. You guys know the value of a beautiful healing space and you can use that now. Very uplifting ❤ You and Bec are doing so beautifully in your crazy circumstances.   Oso is darling❤🐻
Oh my God, I've never been so relieved to see strangers post a video. Sending all good thoughts your way. ❤️
Tim didn’t had his yoga pants on…very disappointed. 😂 it so great to see you all..including Tim. AND THE COACH 🥰😍grrr
Omg , I have missed you guys !  Hope all is well, hope bec is doing good 😊. Thanks for the renovation video, this excited me!
The cabin series continuous y’all!! Glad you have this space to rest right now
Can someone tell me what Athletic Greens taste like? I keep hearing it’s delicious, but no one ever describes it. I refuse to try something without tasting it or at the very least being given a description of how it tastes.
Keep holding on to each other tight. You guys are wonderful and my prayers and positive energy is with you!🙏❤️
Love to you, Bec, Ohso, all of your families and friends ❤️❤️
Fantastic video as usual. Great to see Tim.  Sending ❤️ to you Eamon and Bec. My dad goes for surgery within the next few weeks for his colon removal and getting a stoma as he went for his yearly colonoscopy a few weeks ago and they found a mass,  the surgeon believes it is stage 3 cancer. My dad had colon cancer back in 2013 and was only given 2 months to live and he fought back then and now he has a new fight.
Sending Lots Lots of Love to Bec & Eamon 🙏🏼❤️❤️🙏🏼  From Eddie in Chicago ,USA
You can use an airplane pillow instead of the cone. So much easier!
You are still beautiful Bec. Your spirit is awesome. I'm a 2 time cancer survivor so I understand what you are going through. You got this girl! 🫂
Wishing Bec full recovery ❤️‍🩹 love you guys
Awww I feel so bad for Oso, he did everything to tell you not to take his couch. /CRY.
You guys are both BEAUTIFUL humans... My heart can't take it..💕🤗💕
You're both incredibly brave young people and don't deserve any of this! Know that many millions of people around the world are thinking of you both and praying for you.
This was an awesome video!  I’m so glad Emon is keeping busy.  It helped me when my hubby was undergoing chemo.   I’m sending love and light to you both.  Bec you look beautiful and I’m so happy you have su fb a loving and supportive family.  I’m so glad you have the cabin to call home as you undergo treatments.   I love the renovation of the sun port h.  I hope to do something in our backyard soon as it’s so darn hot here in Las Vegas Area.
So happy to watch another video 😁😁 and even more pleased to hear you're both doing well. Been thinking about you 3 every single day ❤️❤️
Buy Osa one of those inflatable collars, they work really well and don’t break like the cones, and also don’t make them clumsy 👌🏻
Sending lots of love to Bec & Eamon
My Sunday evening (UK) just had a burst of happiness.....
Check in all the time to see how you two are doin..and every day send prayers for the two of you. Thank you for the up date. You are both so very special. Great room and great work Bec on the healing work you are doing.
Awe, Bec your rocking it... So glad to see your hanging in there. I totally understand. Your a true warrior. Keep it up you've got this. Eamon, your awesome. There are a lot of survivors that would beg to have someone like you on there support team. Remember, to have your own support team rooting you on and holding you up when you need it. We are all human. Cause you so deserve it. Hang in there. Bless you both and your families.  Carry on, you got this.... Pink Rocks you so have this.  Wish there were double/triple 👍👍👍you guys so so so deserve it.
Amazing sunroom/workout/entry/loft renovation! It turned out gorgeous, bright and inspiring. Bec, beautiful as always, warrior on sister! Keeping you both in my heart and in my prayers. God bless.
I laughed so hard about the dog hanging onto the sofa! If Bec has a down day, well when, play her that because you can't be sad watching him try to keep his bed/blanket/comfort. I love all your helpers, you're doing a great job on the Vlog, Emon. Keep the faith, and bless little Bec for her courage and good attitude. I wish you both nothing but happiness for all of your days, no matter how many you get, it's never going to be enough for any of us. Yet, we still clean our houses, fix our cars, and all the rest. I'm happy to see you both carrying on with your life.
Beautiful souls, doing awesome things, under the most difficult of circumstances.  The very definition of inspiration.  🥰
Love, light and healing to you both!
I am so happy to see this update from you! I have been thinking about you and just wanted to send you both lots of love! I hope that you are able to experience a bit of joy sometime in each day! From this video, it seems like Oso is the bringer of a lot of those daily doses of joy! He is so precious!   The porch looks amazing and I love Eamon's vision for the weight wall. I love that there is a special space for Bec to do yoga! Best wishes and may the good days eclipse the bad days!!!
Sending best wishes from North Carolina, hope you’re feeling some better.
❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏👍🏻😘
Sending hugs and love! That room looks fantastic! Especially love the weight wall!
2000 years later 🤣🤣
Well done.  Peace be with you both  <3
Oso, too funny! Amazing work !!!
You guys are amazing!  I love how supportive you both are of each other.  I love the remodel.
I’m so happy to see y’all, love you both!!Stay Strong 💜
sending millions of hugs and kisses to beck and you to Eamon you guys are the best !! I love your videos and your mental strength sno much even though it's hard you are going through it like chefs !!! lots of love from Belgium 💜 💜 💜
Eamon totally killed it. And sorry to Bob, Oso has replaced him as my favorite supporting actor.
Born and raised in San Antonio and I love seeing Eamon wear his Spurs sweater and it’s the old school colors. Bec on my goodness you look so beautiful and you guys are always in my thoughts. 💟
PIVOT!
Awe, my great aunt used to say "I don't love you, I ADORE YOU!" and she had such a sunny disposition just like Bec & Eamon. Power through!
Eamon i send you green and lots of positive thoughts and energy! ❤️
So great to see this video in my feed today.  Thank you Eamon for sharing your journey as well, it will be healing for you as you both walk this journey.  I also walked along side my husband battling the “c” (different meaning from what it is currently).  Eamon you are doing amazing keep sharing and letting it out to keep your own mental health in check.  Loved your creative renovation of the new entryway/workout area and all-in-all a place to enjoy.  I like your idea of putting a window up in the loft space😃👍🏼( so the was it the sunset or sunrise) could be enjoyed while sipping some Chai or possible a glass of wine.  Bec you are stunning, it was great to see you but at the same time we want you to get all the rest you need.❤️ Don’t push your recovery to fast to soon.  We are here and will continue to lift up prayer, may you feel Abba Fathers embrace from each and everyone of us🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼   Oso is a great edition to the family.  He is really keeping Eamon on his toes-:) Loved the scene when trying to move out his favorite spot to chill, “The couch”😃👍🏼 Oh and that grilled crunch meal, looked oh so yummy 😃👍🏼 Is that in your cookbook?? Blessings sent all the way from Oregon(PNW) Phil 4:6-7 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
I love you guys, beautiful souls. God bless you  💐 Bec you are really inspiring and strong
I’m So So So happy to see this video I check every Sunday. Eamon your a superstar for being so strong for Bec. Your love for each other is so powerful and beautiful. Stay strong you two! Love you guys from London ❤️❤️
Hey guys! So glad to see you both,  Bec you look great!!! You go !, half way through what a champ. Eamon great job on the build nice layout and planning. Stay positive and don't ever feel that reaching out when time is tough is a better move,  staying connected family and friends  is the best way to go. FYI I have the same tendency. One last thing please know that this is your time and though we love to see you etc... focus on you and we will be here !!!! BIG HUG and KISS to you both.
The end result is just overwhelming 😍👍🏻 Eamon thanks so much for sharing your emotions right now. I’m chronically ill and I know it isn’t easy on my husband to see me in pain and not really feeling myself. Bec, you’re rocking the no hair look, you’re still so beautiful ❤️sending lots of love, strength and healing your way ☀️❤️Katy
Had to stop the video to catch my breath laughing at Oso jumping on that couch! 😂😂😂
We Love you Eamon ❤️Hugs & prayers
Eamon you got this bud!   I went through brain cancer with my daddy and sister.  I can’t imagine going through this with my husband.   Your love is strong and you are strong.  Hugs to and Bec.  Oh my gosh love the coloring it soothes my mind.     Love the video 💗Sending positive vibes💕
This video is my Sunday joy today! Even a two-minute video just to know you are okay would have been the highlight of my day, but this was totally frosting. I am so happy to see you both, as well as the love of family and friends you have been surrounded by. You've got this, and I am (well, we all here in internetlandia are) so rooting for you!!! The new redesigned/rebuilt space looks incredible, and it will hopefully bring you lots of health, peace and tranquility, and joy in the years to come. I love how you incorporate elements for your four-legged fur-bear in there too. Last but not least...that crunch wrap looked like it was the BOMB!!! Much love to you both!
Just wanted to let you know we’re right there with you on this journey. Lots of love and wishes for strength! Healing! Energy! Eamon, you’re a rock star right along with that sweet girl there next to you. Prayers and blessings for you both. And an awesome job on that “porch”!! It is completely transformed!!
Stay strong E and B ! <3
Love to you both!! 🙏❤❤❤
That room looks amazing!!!! And Bec, you are so strong and looking great! Oso is oso cute, he looks like he makes everyone a little more happy☺️what kind of dog is he?
Ahhh!!! It was so good to see you guys!! I miss seeing your faces on here. Sending you all the love and extra strength. Oso is hilarious and I'm so glad he has a forever home with you guys and can bring extra snuggles and joy when needed. 💓

Eamon.. You don't "owe us" anything. But thank you for your kind words and opening up to us all🤗. I hope opening up helps you to! Men need to open up more👍.. It's important for your mental health. You are a rock and it's great how your families and friends are there for you both. Great that Bec has reached the half way point👍🤗...stay strong💪 Bec🤗.  Oso steals the show.. The sofa, cuddly toy playing with his collar, licking Becs feet etc.. So funny and cute.... You guys have to keep him.. He is absolutely adorable 🤗.
Awesome job keeping your lives on track, doing what needs to get done - INSPIRATIONAL!!!
So happy to see your faces. Glad Bec is doing well and thank you Eamon for being vulnerable. Sending you both love, strength, and healing vibes.

♥♥♥♥
It’s so lovely to see your lovely faces. You’ve been in my thoughts a lot. Sending love and strength your way. Xx
❤❤❤❤
my brother did the 🎨 art drawing also while going through chemo.
This transformation is incredible 🤩🤩. Well done !! Sending love to you two legends ♥️💕💪✨
Sending positive vibes for a full recovery. ❤️from 🇬🇧
Your both beautiful people!
Our vet uses Big Swimming Pool Noodles instead of those big cumbersome Neck Torturers like Oso is wearing when the need arises. They are way smaller and manageable for the animal but get the job of keeping them from licking, etc. You put it around their neck, secure it with duct tape and “walla!”
The porch looks amazing! Beautiful! Love to both of you and Ozzo ❤️
So glad to see you all..Become glad you are feeling some better. My prayers go to you ..Eamon you have my prayers for taking such great care of Bec.. The new addition is awesome... You could be a carpenter.. Fantastic job..God bless..Prayers continues to be sent.. Love your videos..🇺🇸🌹❤️
Nice reservation and thoughts and prayers 🙏.  Go Spurs Go rockin the sweater
So much love to you, Eamon. And to you, Bec. ❤️❤️❤️
Have missed seeing your videos, glad you have been busy.  Eamon you are a cabin master!  Beautiful transformation. Eamon Stay strong and be sure to do your self care, step away, go for a drive, take a hike go visit friends it will help keep your positive energy flowing.  Been in your position and the emotions are tough to work through, the not having any control of it is rough, just learn to accept what it is and move forward.  Bec, you are rocking the bald head, you are beautiful, strong and inspiring!!  Keep on exercising as much as you can to keep up your strength you are doing great.  Snuggle with the pup you both will love it.
You’re both so positive and living life in the moment. Continue to be grateful… continue to support each other. Sending healing hugs and encouragement to you. Prayers for your guidance, courage and wisdom.
Ok so the two of you make me cry more than any other YouTuber!  Love to Eamon and to Bec.  You are all in my prayers!
Bravo Eamon & Bec!!!   So good to see you guys and Oso boy!!!!  ❤
Good to see y’all back. Continuing to pray
OK Bec you have a beautifully shared head and it is completely  Unnecessary to cover it up and hide it.  And can I turn a terrible incident that happened recently into a to a funny and loving endearment?      I Look forward to seeing Bec star in GI Jane part 2!!  Yea! Yea! Nooooooo? 😆 Look that was a bad ass movie and can't understand why anyone would be offended by being Entangled with it.
It is so great what both of you achieve, and how you support each other. I am happy to see a renovating vlog. I love that and I am sure soon there will be a travel vlog again. It is a hard and tough time and prices trippled for everything here in Europe, man. I think you did the best by going back to normal routine and what you love. This helps Beck too. You are unbreakable, Eamon! Two steps forward, one step back. Love you guys sending you so much love. Btw it looks amazing! 🙏🌈🎁♥️😇🍀🤗😊🎉
Thank you so much for the update. I keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Beautiful addition to your already beautiful home.❤️
Stay strong n keep on marching on 💖✌👊✌
Wow. Just WoW. ❤️❤️❤️
Get an inflatable collar,  you life will be much easier.
Get oso an inflatable ring for his next they are so much better.
Oso, the cone…… I’m screaming 😂😂😂😂😂
Now I know where bec gets her laugh from 😂😂 just like her dad
Great to see you both…..sending you both love strength courage and the fierce tenacity needed to fight this battle together.   The gym room entrance is stunning!  Be well.
Everything looks amazing but more importantly, Bec, you are halfway there girl!  It is so tough but you have got this. 💕
You are both lookin good!
Eamon and Bec so good seeing you too again glad Bec is doing better love your vlog so cool how the new porch  came together love it . Eamon I know its hard but you're such an anchor for Bec continue to be that for her and your family
Eamon & Bec- We send you love and happy endings. As always, you are both so inspiring. Be ever thankful for all of your families support.
Hi Guys!  What a treat to have some Eamon n Bec n Bear OsO,to my Sun.  The scenes of trying to move The oso couch made my day! He is the best !  Thanks for all your thoughts Bec looks so awesome !  More updates luv u guys!  🥰
So great to see you guys back to your normal antics! Oso was really the star of this one though, I️ could no stop laughing! Sending you both love and support. The gym looks incredible
Prayers for you all!
So glad to see this video. I was thinking about you every Sunday ( and in between but shhh)
I had tears in my eyes when Bec came on.  She looks so great.  My daughter is living her best life while undergoing chemo for Stage 4 breast cancer. Hugs to you both.
Eamon I was a caregiver for my mom before she passed and it is HARD. Emotionally it’s hard to see someone you love who was healthy deteriorate. But on top of that the organization needed to pick up the rest of the house duties, knowing meds, medical appointments, (and for us Americans) the money needed to cover medical expenses are all added stressors. You and Bec are doing such a great job navigating this together, and I’m happy for y’all that you have family around to help. When family gets majorly sick, it truly takes a village to pull through. Bec will be done with chemo in no time and y’all will be so much stronger and closer afterwards. Sending you all the love!
Thank you so much for opening up Eamon 💛 my thoughts and prayers are with you both 🙂
Inspiring
Big hugs and positivity to you both , and wow! Your new room is amazing 👏 😍
Amazing! Thanks for the vid!!
God!!! dont you look nice with a bald head!!!! How unfair is that...my head is all lumpy and a funny shape🤣🤣🤣🤣you are defo rocking that look... truly beautiful ❤️ even when you are sickxxxxx
I love the dog 🤣😂🤣😂
It turned out so Beautifully!!! God bless you both. 🙏🙏
Hey Eamon, as a husband of woman who is a breast cancer survivor i feel you and understand you, we are not the one fighting the battle but we are called to support them and make everything in our power to make the feel better, but  we struggle too because we love them… believe me, with faith and good attitude she will get better!!! I have Bec and you im my prayers!!!!
He’s trying to help
I am happy that Bec is halfway through her chemo treatments. I am not and I have been having them every day for over six months.
You are an amazing couple and prayers are with you guys. Love oso  he was awesome to see
Oso made me laugh so much , jumping on the couch! ( and the friends clip “pivotttt”) Lol   I so think of you both and I’m sending you strength from afar “Australia “.

Aw, Eamon I am so glad your being honest to the vlog. I bet Bec is really lucky to have you and your support system. And i love how you are being vulnerbale to the vlog to. Looking forward to more vlogs.

Been thinking of you both. Well done you two on the new room! Bec it was great to see that big beautiful smile of yours.
I prefer Adam topless!!!
So glad to see you again! Your strength, love and positivity continue to impress and inspire us. Happy that you two are hanging in there, but please take all the time you need to heal. We love you and promise to be patient.   And, of course, the sunroom looks fantastic!
Look after yourself Eamon , Bec has been strong and you both are so loved . If love could heal you’d be well in no time.
Just sending lots and lots of love to you both. You are in my thoughts. 😍
Good job with renos and everything! Wishing you health!

Wonderful video of your gym room and loft.  Great job, it looks fantastic and yes very motivating-looking!  Keep up the great work, Bec, and I wish you much healing and wellness!  So amazed at your positivity and attitude.  Eamon:  You are such an amazing partner to Bec, and so inspirational.  All the best; as the best is yet to come, I’m sure!  A fan from Ottawa (Ontario!)
The bird feeder is dog tv.
Love you guys. Wishing all the happiness you deserve, and total recovery for Bec.  God bless you!!!
Amon! You lost some weight also. I Please take care of yourself as well. Bec needs you healthy.
I love OSOOOO😭😍😍😍😍, HE IS THE CUTEST DOG EVER
Love you guys!!! Oso bear and the sofa was the best!!!! Sending positive vibes and love 🥰
You're both such awesome humans! Makes my day always better watching your videos and seeing how you deal with your current situation. You have such a loving environment, warms my heart. Much love!
Just can’t say it enough, I love you guys.
Your dog is sooo funny 😁 such a big character love him x I'm constantly wondering how becs is doing, so pleased to watch this video ☺ x
Hang in there Bec, I’ve been going through Bladder cancer since Aug 2020. It’s been rough but feeling good now
I literally cried when I saw you guys uploaded a video! is always heart warming to see you guys! Eamon stay strong we all love and support you both in this journey. This shall pass and you will be stronger together ❤️  Hola Tim! I I am so happy to see Bec and see back building!! many hugs 🫂 🤗 to all of you and Oso que es un niño precioso! 💞💞💞💞💞 The sun room turned out beautifully 😍
Love your paradise in the woods.  Keep up the good work. Great idea with the loft area. I will pray for you guys.  Take care!! Your sunroom looks awesome with the renovations. Weight wall is neat. It is hard to see your sadness Eamon. I feel your pain.
Continuing positive healing thoughts to Bec on her recovery! You should check out a Comfy Cone for Oso as they are soft sided and won't break like the brittle regular conventional ones he is wearing. If not that then there are inflatable options out there too, but that brittle conventional cone never works well for larger dogs, especially those outdoors as often as your boy is. Pawsitive healing thoughts to Oso too, come to think of it!
Oh my.  I laughed so hard.  First Osso on the couch. Then the cone.  Then the ball. I didn’t realize how bad i needed that laugh.  Bec, your in my prayers.
Super happy to see your smiling faces today.
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Job well done, love the way you divided the room & also have storage/loft up for added space. Also got a hugh kick with Ozo 🐕  not wanting to give up his personal couch. Each room is coming along beautifully.
Sending love your way! The room looks amazing Eamon, I agree with Bec it is amazing to see the things you come up with :)
Yay!!! So happy to see a video from you all this week! I’ve been missing ya’ll! This room looks incredible and it is astonishing that ya’ll have been able to do anything at all on top of what you both are dealing with! So much love to you both!!
🙏🏼So Happy to see you 2 working together 🇨🇦 Rest/Sleep is Healing ❤️
When my dog had the cone we duct taped the whole cone poor thing could barely see
Eamon in his element!!! Handy man I soo and motivation!!! Stay strong man your doing great! Love to bec and os
Seeing your vlog made my day. I'm so happy to see Bec up and around, looking as bold and graceful as ever and Eamon being the fun loving design master that he is. I admire you both for being so open and honest about your struggles. As a cancer survivor I can understand how difficult one's cancer journey can be on everyone involved. Bec your displays of love, appreciation and courage are next level. I'm left in awe by your smile and positive attitude. It radiates through the screen. Eamon it's so great to see you staying busy, making your home more beautiful and functional, and providing Bec with the love, support and encouragement that she needs right now. I can also relate to the dark thoughts and hope that you are getting some help for yourself. The role that you are taking on is a very difficult one and you too could use a helping hand. Great job on the room, it's gorgeous by the way. And I've fallen in love with Oso. He provides some much needed comic relief to your vlogs. The topic of cancer can feel pretty heavy but you guys do a great job of keeping it feeling light and not overwhelming despite the challenges your dealing with. You have truly evolved your content creation to a higher level. I'll continue to keep you all (including your family and friends) in my prayers for healing and strength and I hope that once the chemo is over, that the doctors provide you both with the news you've been waiting to hear. Sending you love and hugs from Dallas, TX. ❤️
Good to see you both.  You are “both” amazing.  Take care!
Happy to see a video from you two! I know we’re all worried about you both. Good to see Bec! I know she has bad days but the few times we saw her in this video she looks really good! It was good seeing Bob and the rest of your families! Love seeing your foster pup! Animals are amazing therapy! Praying for you both always! Also I’m making those vegan crunch wrap supremes tonight!!

Ahhhhh!!! I’ve missed you guys so much 😭💗💗
Love all the Osso hilariousness!  Thanks for a lot of laughs!  I appreciate your opening up about your struggles.  We're all sending you energy for strength.  Love you both.

And thank you Eamon for the honest words.
🤎🤎🤎
Eamon thanks for the update. Believe me we totally understand you not putting out videos at this moment and you don’t owe us a thing. You have a huge family that are accustomed to seeing you every Sunday who only want Bec to get better. Just continue to be her best bud and her rock. Sending you both lots of love.
Love you guys❤️
Legit making a crunch wrap now
So good to see you again.  I have been worried about you while you have been away.  You look strong and beautiful and are a part of my evening prayers at the end of each day.Stay strong. Love and prayers to you both.
Oso is epic lol! Laughed so hard watching the couch being moved🤣 and then the cone! LMAO! He is a great addition to your fam
So much love to both of you!  you continue to be an inspiration even in the midst of your struggles. Seriously, that is impressive. I had a health crisis recently and completely shut down. I know having those times are ok too (and even important) but I applaud all the ways you are both continuing to grow with and through your challenges.  So much love!  Always let us know how we can help. Hell, I donated to save Trinity in Mexico so I am clearly on your team whether you know me or not!  See you Sunday!
We are at the same place breast cancer my m'en is amazin its toff for him to but with love we gone be o.k but one day at the time love xxxx
Been missing you guys!
You should put real windows instead of the plexiglass.
❤️  Eamon and Bec you two are so wonderful and positive. Sending positive healing vibes your way.
When fighting this disease your going to have the milie highes and the crushing lows. Went through it with my moms battle that sadly she did not win. All you can do is take it one day at time and see what you guys are up for that day. Your going to have days where you smile and laugh and other days or times where all you can do is cry. its normal, that's why talking to people and sometimes even talking to someone outside helps. Just like my dad and me were rocks to my mom, you can go through all the emotions because you are human and its okay, it has to come out too like a laugh. Thank you for sharing your journey through your life with us. We love you both and just want you to be the best you you can be, laught, tears and all.
So happy to see that Bec is doing great!
Y’all are amazing!  Eamon…… so much love and light to you!
Wow, awesome room. You're so talented! Great job.
The new room looks amazing. Sending best wishes and healing vibes to you two! ❤
Truly bring attention to the small but very important stuff!❤️🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Oso and the couch ..I was laughing so hard!!!  Eamon...you owe us nothing.  I love that you opened up, but you don't have to.  Just know you are both loved by so many and we are all surrounding you BOTH with positivity, support, and healing thoughts.  ❤❤❤
Sending prayers 🙏 ❤️.
❤️
Room looks amazing!
Eamon it was so nice to hear how you’re doing. It’s hard but you guys are going to make it through together. Bec is a warrior, and you two will be closer than ever when she comes out on the other side of this. Sending you all my prayers ❤️  Also, the room looks AMAZING!! I love that weight rack built into the wall.
Good to see Bec smile. Eamon you are really a rock, the room is looking great. Oso is a hoot, I am glad he is there, he definitely increases morale
So happy to hear from you guys again. I can't believe how positive you both still are and so strong. Sending much love, strength and health.
Stay strong and positive. Bec needs that. Your a rock star bud! Bec needs your love and support, it will help you both! Sending love and prayers to you both! Bec, you are also a rock star! Lots of love from Colorado! We are praying for you both!
U2❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
That was so sad!!!! How could you take oso favourite sofa 😭😳😭🤣😭🤣that poor doggo xxxx
♥️🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻
I really appreciate you two modeling to me what a great relationship looks like, I wish you guys the best. Love from Wisconsin forever!!
Omg Oso jumping on the couch LMAO I was dying!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Thanks for the laugh 💜
Pardon me Eamon. But damn Bec, you look hot as hell!   Hair only complements your beauty and personality.  Truth.   There are many good reasons why you two have such a thriving channel, a haircut ain't one of them.
Can't separate a dog and his sofa!
Praying and consciously sending healing thoughts, support, love, to you via the universe. 🕊
I check up on you guys more than you know! I'm a cancer survivor so I feel you Bec and wish you the fastest recovery. And Eamon you're an amazing guy. So much love from Morocco to you guys ❤️
What a beautiful home you have built together. Eamon you are Bec's rock throughout all of this and watching that small clip of you getting emotional. It shows how much you love her and you are falling more in love with her now. You are a true definition on what a great man supposed to be. And WOW on the room. It looks amazing!!! I truly enjoy your guys videos. Can't wait to see the next video. 💛💛💛
That loft would be a great place to meditate :)
My heart goes out to both of you!  Beautiful pictures Bec,  and the porch room looks wonderful like everything else you both have done to that house!
Oso really did love that couch.
You guys have done such a good job on that cabin. Like you would never think it was ever that old looking shack it was when you first found it. It's such a beautiful property now. Just goes to show you don't need to start with something perfect. Best build of all you van life turned homesteaders. ❤️❤️ 2nd place goes to Tyler and Todd. Then Trent and Allie. So on and so forth.. 😊😊
Deamon and Beck, you two are amazing people, sending lots of love to you both. Eamon, the room looks beautiful ❤️❤️
What a great transformation, cabin entrance looking sooo good ! And seeing you guys going strong 💜
We love you, but can Osso please have his own channel?  He had us cracking up the whole time! ❤️😂
I am so happy to see you getting involved, even if your strength is not what it was. You are doing amazing and Eamon is the best partner, the way he looks after you and is strong for both of you is commendable. Sending lots of love and healing thoughts 🥰🥰
Seeing Bec get excited about the little things like a vegan supreme crunch wrap or coloring beings me so much joy ❤️
This was a great video! You did an awesome job and I never laughed so hard at Oso and the couch...he almost chose the couch over you two! So funny!!! My husband had cancer 12 years ago and being the caregiver is such a hard job! He's reciprocated by giving me lots of foot rubs since then, so it's been a win-win. 😁🥰 People really don't get how hard it is, but you are doing great. Blessings to you both!
Wow what a transformation of a room it looks fabulous. You made me tear up too when you spoke openly about  your love Bec's. It's so hard to watch, I had to do this for my mum so my heart goes out to you Eamon, Stay strong. Bec's you too are amazing. After chemo getting up and helping with the build, but also realizing when you need to stop and have rest time. You both have such a lovely family helping you too and as for Bear, well he made me laugh about losing his couch and ending up with a trampoline, how cute is he. Keep staying strong & safe you 3. Sending big Hugs Uk. Also would like to say how Bec's has made a huge difference too, as people are donating their hair for wigs for cancer patients that's just amazing. Hugs
Cut a pool noodle into chunks and run his collar through them. It prevents them from turning their head and biting their backside or what ever he's not suppose to be chewing. GIGGLE
So Glad to see a new video from you I’ve been praying & thinking of you both!   All my Love Bec & Eamen
OSSO IS HILARIOUS
Prayers 🙏🙏 for you both
So good to see your beautiful faces!!! Great job Eamon!!!!
It is so good to see you Two again!  I really look forward to watching you guys.  Keeping up the faith 🙏 with you guys!
This is one of the best videos on so many levels.  Deeper than deep. Kinder than kind.  Love is a choice for sure.  Pushing thru❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥💝💗💖❣️
Eamon & Bec-Absolutely simple & Refreshing. Suggestion-I may have extended the Loft area a bit more over the high vaulted ceiling, put in a couple reading lights & a 📚 nook, but that could eventually could be added;) I would definitely put in an Attic 🪜 ladder like they install in Garages with handrails. I’m happy to hear Bec is healthy during her treatments. I had a brother go through extensive Chemo/Radiation & it was horrific on his entire body, & mental state of health. He was not nearly as healthy as you & Bec. But Gods healing was masterfully implemented through the power of prayer. Praying for you & Bec. Cancer be gone in the precious name of Jesus. Love you both ♥️♥️
It’s hard, it really is. Had to deal with my dad going through chemo twice for lymphoma and now he’s having other health issues plus being weak on his feet. It’s never easy. Plus, I work 70+ hours a week and don’t live with my folks. Hang in there. We’re with you both!
You guys are so strong and together ur unbeatable, going through this tough time and being such an amazing team is just amazing to see.🤗🤗❤❤
Feel the love from so many 💕
It’s so nice to see your smiling faces! Bec looks absolutely stunning 😍😍😍😍 you both are so lucky to have each other during the difficult times and the beautiful times. Love you guys so much!
😂😂😂 I laughed so hard watching as Oso kept getting on HIS couch!!!
Of course it’s been hard for you too,  you want to support the woman you love.  You guys have this !!  You’re a fantastic team.  Love and best vibes from the U.K xxx
So good to see you, both. Continued prayers for healing, stamina, peace & comfort. Y’all got this🙏🏻
💪 ❤ i see you eamon You are such a strong partnership and i seen that truly from you both over the years. But especially as shes been sick I see.you ! All that work will be such a happy moment for her and I want her to stay happy and positive💓keep swimmimg you 2.
It was so good to see you guys.
Such a beautiful room! Just know that you both are in my prayers every day. Please take care!❤️🙏🏻❤️
Amazing space!!  So inspiring!!  And you are both amazing!!  And Bear is so funny and smart and he loves mom and dad so much!!  Sending all the love!!  ❤️💫🐶🏡💫❤️
Ah missed this too much. Little house and family is looking too cozy. Have a fabulous day today. ❤️
Missed you guys ❤ Bec my roommate in college is also in liquid sunshine treatment. You two women are bad ass warriors. You are in my prayers and am sending you light and love. Eamon you are doing amazing ❤ My 15 year old keeps saying when she watches y'alls videos "Mom I hope I can find an Eamon". Keep your head up bud. Love you guys.
i missed you guys!!!
It looks fantastic, but you need to get a new couch for your very, very, very cool dog.
I cannot think of the last time I laughed so hard, Oso with the couch, Oso with the camera, Oso with the paint, Oso with the cone, Oso you are a GOOD boy!!!! And Eamon, cried with you while you spoke. Sending all the love and extra hugs. Bec, all the love and extra hugs. What am amazing space (ANOTHER ONE) that you've created. xoxox
Love you both and sending you both all of my prayers and positive thoughts 💖💙  Awesome job on the gym it looks fantastic 👍☺️
Bear makes me laugh so much, he's beautiful. What breed is he? He kind of looks like our American Bulldog 🐶❤
I can’t imagine how difficult this is-Thank you for sharing your struggle too.
The porch/gym and new loft area looks amazing. You guys are so strong and courageous but not scared to show your vulnerability. I found myself stroking the screen Eamon when you were poring out your heart such was my desire to reach out and comfort you.  Your both fighters, you'll get through this.
So Glad to see you all back. I watch Trent & Allie & heard her say she was cutting her hair in support of you. I don’t have any hair but if I did I would do the same. Great work on the sunroom Eamon & Family!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lots of love to both of you managing these difficult times together with your family. I was glad to also see how you are dealing with this in your own way as well Eamon, because such difficult times are hard for both of you and everyone closely related. Keep up the great spirit, and I am sure you really are the rock you're trying to be for Bec!!
So great to see you both….❤️
Bec ….. Bald >>>> BEAUTIFUL !!!!  Coming from a bald guy of 30yrs !!!
Its very hard for the caretakers of those who are going through cancer, and a little scary.  I had breast cancer 20 years ago, i always allowed myself to have a cry a couple of times a day, particularly on chemo days.  I watched a lot of funny movies and ate a lot of soup...easy to get down...THE GOOD NEWS IS I'M STILL HERE...I love my life and I know you guys are going to be here 20 years from now..much love to you both take it easy Huge virtual hugs to both of you...xxxx  LOVE THAT DOGGY
So happy to see both of your smiling faces. What a great video you two! The new workout room looks Amazing 🤩🤩🤩 And Oso/ Bear stole the show🥰 I think you two have found the Dog for you, He is incredible and has so much personality and energy just like you two♥️ Bec, You are doing Amazing lady, I am so proud of you and the positivity that you show all of us, remember that you are half way through, YOU'VE GOT THIS ♥️ Sending All my Love to you and Eamon♥️
💖Bec you look great! Take care & rest to fight ! Eamon keep strong & remember to take care of yourself also!
hammer tip... the farther away your hand is from the head, the more efficient you can swing the hammer.

You're so strong and such an amazing partner to Bec. Keep going you guys can absolutely smash this together. Also the cabin is looking AMAZING all your hard work is paying off 👌🏻💕

It was so wonderful, seeing all 3 of you! Beautiful Bec, your strength is inspiring! Adorable Oso! He did not want to lose that couch, lol! And amazing Eamon, holding everyone and everything together. Sending continued prayers and hugs for you all. You are very loved 🥰 P. S. The porch looks incredible 😍
Sending lots of love your positivity will see you through to those bright days ahead 😍😘👍😘
My heart aches for both of you.  I have Lord and Savior who is absolutely incredibly in love with both of you.  My prayers are for you.
What a gorgeous addition to your home, absolutely dreamy and total home gym goals right there! ❤️ Eamon you are such a special person and appreciate opening your heart to us all on how you're feeling, Bec couldn't ask for a more supportive partner ❤️ You guys are the best, really loved this video, can't wait for the next ones (when you're ready to), love to you both and Oso from Chester, UK ❤️
Y’all are amazing!! Continued love and prayers to both of you!!!
As usual a roller coaster of emotions, I know it must be so hard to keep that positive attitude fed and watered but you have such amazing support in each other and with your families. The room looks the nuts but I didn't expect anything less, it matches your whole house. Keep those fighting boots on and you'll soon be jumping off the docks in the sunshine. much love and prayers to you both xxx
Oh my so excited to see you put out a video as have missed you guys. Amazing job done on the porch. Enjoyed and thank you so much. Big Hugs to both along with Love. Sending Bec well wishes. Eamon your the man.

He went back to it as he had skipped it for one day Bec..I research everything..I am in the medical field.  I use to work at DHMC..plz check this out..very positive xo. Take care BOTH of you!!  Much love from VT 🌲🍁❤
Awe poor Osso❤️
It's great to see you and Bec.   I'm praying for Bec and you.   Glad your spirits are up and you're back to renovating.
My family knows from experience  the difficulties.  You guys are are so strong! Keeping busy I found helps me. Prayers coming from our family to yours!
I’m absolutely in love with Oso! I think he’s just what you both needed at this time. He’s so full of love and still has that puppy goofiness. Love you both, think about you all the time and you’re in my heart. ❤️
Cancer robs you of every little bit of control.  All you can do is grit your teeth and put one foot in front of the other untill you get through it.  Give each other lots of hugs and celebrate the wins no matter how small.  Sending loads of love to you both, you got this xx❤
So good - Love this video - Thx for sharing Eamon!!!!!!
Still sending you guys lots of prayers and good thoughts!!! You’re both so strong and brave. You will make it through this Bec stronger and better then ever!! Thinking of you both!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oso should consider a side career in acting, seriously! Eamon, as was mentioned before, thank you for taking the time in front of camera, to bare the inside of your shimmery soul, human as it is. Your ability to motivate different members of your family to come help you rebuild Workout Central is amazing, but I will forever be in love with your original handyman, if only for his penchant for yoga hotpants. The family and I even made our own versions of CrunchWrap Supremes, ours with fontina cheese, crisp iceberg, fresh tomatoes, avocado and we use crispy refried corn tortillas as our base. And then, of course, who can resist hot sauce or sour cream? Most important, to see Bec up and about, willing to work is such a beautiful sight to behold. Thank goodness she's halfway thru and may she slay the C Beast with her colorful mandalas and her peaceful resilience. You all have been missed. My Sunday morning feels complete hearing how life fares for y'all north of Toronto.
Good lord, Bec's ancestors must have been painters, her whole family has the SKILLS, looks amazing
Praying for Bec!! So happy to see you guys!!!!stay Strong you both inspire us!!
You know you always have my love and support. What a great positive community you have around you. We see you, we pray for you and we love you.  Nebraska is sending love and support to you both.
Glad to see you! <3 Missed you! Hope Bec is feeling better and strong as she is! We are all with you girl! Kick that cancer in the A$$!
You guys should wrap Christmas lights around the two beams!! will look so beautiful love the new space
HAHAHA THE DOG IS A CHARACTER WITH THIS CONE😂😂😂😂
Loved the video.. what kiy of dog is that!!? Love him 🥰
The Gym came out nice well done Osso i mean eamon 😀 You guys rock stay possitive dude you have some great tools makes a DIY job way easier. Sending sunshine frome Cape town well soon we are also into winter but not asb chilli as yours
Wow that new room!!! ❤️
I know how hard it is to be someone's support through something like this. You almost feel like you shouldn't complain because your loved one is going through so much more. But it is hard! I appreciate your vulnerability, Eamon. You are doing the hard job of being Bec's main support. Now let other people take on the task of supporting you. I'm praying for you both every time I think of you!  Oh, and great job on that room! It's beautiful and functional!
The opening scene with doggie was the funniest!
Sending love from Australia
Always happy to see an update from y’all! Keep staying strong!! 💛
Halleluiah so good to hear and  see you guys..big  hugs!!!!!!
Loved this video. Laughed a lot. Loving how much joy your new furbaby is bringing you. Just what you both need when times are tough. Keep being vulnerable Eamon, it's the reality of caring for someone and watching that person go through the hardest time of their life. It affects everyone xx
Eamon you are such a great support for Bec and hearing how you feel makes me wanna send many more positive vibes for you🥰 I was so happy to see Bec today! Her smile is contagious 😍! Such a beautiful person you two are together and everything you have accomplished 💗 just makes me believe everything will be better soon💜 Love you guys so so much!
Bec, it is so wonderful to see you!! Take all the time you need to get better, take care of yourself and process it any way that you discover helps you! Do whatever you need for yourselves. Eaimon, thank you for your strength, love and care of Bec, and thank you for keeping Bec laughing. Thanks for sharing your new project, you did a fabulous job!
Job well done! It looks refreshing! Glad you are doing well, Bec! Prayers and healing energy sent your way. I know it is difficult being the support, Eamon, but you are made for it. Sending you health and strength! Much love!
Be well, sending ☀️sun from Israel
Oso, what a sweet dog !   Spelling?
Much love and blessings to you both and all your wonderful family and friends. Here's to positive thoughts and aspirations for healthy happy bodies and minds.
Love!!!
Loved the content. You two are awesome.
Wish you both happiness and health! Thanks for sharing your story!
Oso no don't take my couch, if you're taking it I'm going to make it difficult. 🤣 Also Oso, cones cannot stop me. The room looks amazing. I think adding a window to the loft would add some light and views for whoever is up there. Making it a book nook would be great if you guys like reading. Glad to see you both smiling. 😊 Continued prayers now and always. 💕
This episode was fantastic!!! A perfect length, humor, heartfelt messages, gorgeous scenery, everything we could ask for. I think I like longer episodes less frequently, as opposed to weekly short episodes. It makes the story arc stronger, I think. I still think of you every Sunday and send lots of love. ❤️
I like everyone else have had you both on my mind and in my prayers, stay strong !!!!
Prayers for both of you. May God hold you in his living hands.
So happy to see another video from you guys! I hope Bec is doing ok 🥰 I love how much Oso didn’t want you to get rid out that couch 🤣🤣 he is so funny! 💕 Eamon you are a wonderful man and have such a big heart! Make sure you take care of yourself and talk to your family and friends about how your feeling! Being strong for other people can take its toll so please make sure you look after your mental health as well as looking after Bec 💙💙💙💙💙
Oso is hilarious, thanks for the laughs!  Bet you look wonderful and Eamon, make sure you take care of yourself too!
Thank you, thank you, thank you for the vlog today. I’ve been so worried and it’s fantastic to have an update. Oso is such a blessing for you both. The patio room looks amazing and welcoming. Well done. What’s going to be the next project Eamon?
I am sooo thrilled to see you guys! 👏🏽 I was impatiently waiting for your next post. In other words…worried. 😟 I’m really happy to see you both doing well and holding up as best you can. The porch is absolutely beautiful and Orzo is freakin hilarious! 🤣🤣 Watching him fight to keep his couch had me dying laughing. Thanks for the post. I know things must be real tough for you right now, we all appreciate you keeping us informed and entertained. LOVE 💕 YOU GUYS TO THE MOON 🌝 AND BACK!! 😘
❤️
I’ve been waiting for weeks for this and I love ittt!!! Missed you guys so much 😬 this is my weekly ritual and I get so sad when my Sunday funday buddies ain’t post 🥰
Hey, Eamon, Bec, and Bear. Awesome porch upgrade.  Thanks to everyone who was there to help.  Even Tim, who took Bears' couch.  Poor Bear.  Bec, you're looking good.  Energy ups and downs are going to be part of this journey right now. Knowing when to take advantage and when to rest is so important.  I like the trending shaved head for women look Bec.  Stay safe, Love you both, hugs for days and belly rubs for Bear.
Woah how do u know how to do all this! This is amazing. Also thank you for opening up to us ur vulnerability is inspirational🥺❤️
Stay busy and stay positive . You guys are so luck to have the cottage to keep you busy . And a place to call home . I love your Chanel and all that you do .

Love, Love, Loved the Osso and couch episode, it was my favorite clip in a long time.  All Love and Good Wishes to Eamon and Bec.  The Lord be with you both.
WOW! Oso lost his couch and his balls all in one video! Harsh!  I think that cone - water bowl flip was on purpose! It's amazing what you've accomplished with that room in such a short amount of time. Adam = Best Brother ever!  Bec's parents = Best In-laws ever.  It's heartwarming to see how you all support one another.
OoOh sooooo so happy to see you again Bec and Eamon.. being sinking of you a lot laitely <3 sending lots of LOOOOOVE and courage from Switzerland <3 <3 <3

You both are in our thoughts keep strong    and positive. XxxxX

Betty in Virginia USA
Nice to see you both! Bec you have such a beautiful face and smile! Eamon, I think we all get it. It is hard and scary! Hang in there. Osso, WOW! Of all the dogs you could have picked, he is the best! The sweetest and most affectionate and a little goofy too. He brings joy into your world.  I will keep praying for you both!
Such a wonderful labour of love.
So good to see y’all!!! 💕💕💕
Warm vibes and wishes to you both from San Diego, California. Looking forward to your next journey to our neck of the woods.
Gosh you guys are great. It’s wonderful to see your family come by and be together. It’s so good to see you guys being able to give the people around you the chance to ‘help’ in this difficult time with practical stuff. It can be hard knowing what to do for friends or family that are going through hard times.  I love seeing Bec growing once again into a new ‘role’ and embracing the rest and the help of others. I know chemo is nasty and ugly and it’s so difficult to see the light sometimes but god Bec you look so beautiful here and i can almost feel the radiation from your heart. You are going to get through this and come out a wise wise woman in the end.  Eamon, so much respect for opening up to the world about your side of it. I’ve been through the process of having a partner with cancer and treatment and can relate to what you are saying. Taking up space and acknowledging that it is hard for you too takes courage.  Much love to you guys and keep on keeping on!!
What a fabulous surprise to see a video from Eamon & Bec this morning. You have both been in my thoughts and prayers. 🙏🏻🙏🏻  I have missed your adventures and positivity. Bec, you look beautiful! You pull off baldness really well. 😘 You are both blessed with loving families and friends and that is what we all need when we are going through tough times. Knowing that you have people you can count on can make such a difference in our lives and in healing. And, Oso Bear ❤️ What a total goofball, he obviously loves you two, of course! The scene with the sofa was a laugh out loud moment. Your vision and the end result for the workout room was great Eamon, very well done (the shed looks good, too!). Continued blessings to both of you. Stay strong, you got this fight Bec. I will continue my prayers. Sending love and healing hugs your way. 💗💛🧡🙏🏻💓💙💞💜🙏🏻❤️💕😘
Girl I loved that green coloring art you did.....and I'm not usually into green....... you should try that diamond art ..... I've not done it but its supposed to be relaxing and when your done you have art you can hang up
Bec I just have to say…You are glowing. Eamon, what a bro 🙌 so strong. Stay positive and keep spreading the love.
So great to see Bec doing well. Continued prayers for her, and you, Eamon. Oso is just adorable!! Workout room looks fantastic.
What a beautiful space you've created--you would never know it wasn't original to the house--it's so light and bright and refreshing!  Continuing to send prayers your way! 🥰
You should put a floor length mirror on the wall space by the weights
Oh Eamonn.. don’t beat yourself up.. you’ve done fab ❤️ Bec you are a legend.. well done 👍 but please stay away from building works.. the spores in the air aren’t good for you during chemo as your immune system is wiped out x x All our love and best wishes to you both xxx
So so beautiful! Way to go Eamon!!!! Thanks for sharing and being real...so nice to see you both...continueing to stand with you both for courage healing and miracles...grown from love and gratitude.....thanks again for your courageous honest inspiration...sending love overflowing
Amazing work!! Not surprised in the slightest. Eamon, your humour and determination brightens a lot of people’s days and just know that your vulnerability is no different. It takes a great deal of strength to open up in the way you did on a platform such as this. And Bec, don’t even get me started! Your optimism and mindset alone has powerful healing capabilities. You both are a force of nature and are so lucky to have each other. Oso too! The laughter he brings is great medicine. Thank you for openly sharing with us and continuing to be such an inspiration :)
Absolutely incredible Eamon!  What a beautiful space.  Love you!   Stay strong guys.  We love you 😍

OMG! What a change. It looks amazing guys. And so glad you fixed the shed Eamon, it looks so good. Both motivation is up the roof. Beck your smile brings happiness to our hearts. Keep strong and positive. Love and be safe!😘🤗🌼🇻🇪💕
This was one of those video's where I would have loved to have know what Oso was thinking when you were taking his couch away. It was funny seeing how he was not going to let it go without putting up a fight. You and your team did an amazing job renovating the room. I'm glad you're staying busy during this difficult time it's good for your mind, body and spirit. It's good to see Bec and how strong she has been even on her weak days. I love the coloring  book Bec. May God continue to strengthen you as he heals you. May he renew your strength. Blessings to both of you.
Love you guys 🥰...and your weird dog lol❤❤❤
try a foam collar for your dog. the kind people wear if they have whiplash
Continued prayers for both of you.  The new studio room looks amazing!
Thank you for being so raw in your emotions Eamon and sharing how you are coping and dealing with everything you’re both going through. . So is a scene stealer and I’m sure is providing so must comfort, love and a distraction. He never fails to put a smile on your face. Bec you are amazing and doing incredible. Stay strong❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ahhh it’s so amazing to see you guys again!! i’m so glad you’re doing as well as possible given the circumstances, and ofc glad to see that the projects have not stopped!! thank you so much for the update :)
Amazing job! Good to see you both smiling ❤️
Eamon and Bec we love you! Bec we're thinking of you and praying for your health. One of us is a three time cancer survivor so we know what you're going through. Stay positive!
Looking great! You should get an aerial silk swing for Bec! It could be a great form of movement while her energy levels are lower!
I couldn’t click fast enough when I saw y’all posted a new video!!
Sending you much love , everything passes , it’s gonna be ok xx
My husband has been making me vegan crunch wraps for years and they are so freaking good!
The room looks amazing, and it’s amazing to see you both and Ohso / Bear too. Sending love and healing vibes. 👍🏾💯❤️💯❤️. Hugz
We love you Eamon&Bec
Thank you for sharing what it’s like for a partner/family member and caregiver. People were to understand or at least acknowledge that. So many of us will be in that same place at some point in our lives. Thank you for being real and for being vulnerable. That takes strength. So much love to you both! ❤️❤️❤️
Been thinking of you guys a lot, keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. You two brought me comfort from watching your videos on the darkest of days over the past few years without even knowing it. Sending love and strength your way. Xx
Thank you so much for the update guys. We didn't like it... WE LOOOOOOVED IT ❤
OMG that doggy is SOO CUTE.  Thanks for sharing your project.  Hang in there you guys!!!!  Sending positive thoughts from California.
Great to see both your faces. You are both in my thoughts. What an amazing space you’ve created, can’t wait to see you both enjoying it together in time cx
Thank you for this video guys! Lots of love to you both ❤❤
Thank you so much for continuing to share your personal life with the world, I send you,Bec and Oso immense love and healing.
your dog is hilarious :)
Fantastic job Eamon and family!  1/2 way there Bec, God bless you and praying for a speedy recovery, days are moving fast pretty soon the treatments will be over and you can get back to yourself!  Your are looking Great for all you have been through.  It will make both of you stronger!  Stay positive I know it is hard, praying for both of you!
I loved this video! The vulnerability, the smiles, love of family and your love for each other. Great job on the room, it's beautiful!   Watching you navigate chemo with honesty, grace and positivity has been helping me, as I started my Chemo journey two days ago! I've got wonderful staff that take care of me at the "Hope Circle"  and the love and support from other patients is amazing! I seen so much love and beauty from patients sharing tips and advice. The best yet was about losing my hair. I never thought I would be so attached to it. This sweet lady was rocking her hat and told me to make it a celebration when shaving head. She went to her hairdresser and took wine and they celebrated her life, laughed and had a good time through the emotional day! She is truly an amazing Spirit, this is her 2nd time around! You are an inspiration for me and I love you so much for that! I could watch your beautiful dog over and over getting on the couch while moving it, that made me laugh to tears and his head cone was sad but so funny! Great video!! Continued prayers for peace, healing , love, laughter, tears and life! Your both so blessed to have each other through the great times and challenging times! God bless! Hug that doggie for me, I'm an avid dog lover my entire life! They just bring so much laughter and joy! God bless! ❤️
Oso is such a goofball! Lol the cuts between him struggling with his cone and him jumping on the couch, how cute and funny!
Aw, bless you both! You're in my prayers.🙏 Eamon, your a good man!  There is nothing like a pet to bring love and entertainment into a home! Lol love Ohso!, Take care guys! Love you both!💗💖💕
I take my hat off to you Eamon, the way you protect, care and love Bec is I am sure at times difficult. With all the current focus on mental health just coping with Covid puts a strain on lives, but add in what you are both going through, I think is testament to greatness. God bless.
We love you!   I remember you in my prayers.   Your entrance & workout space turned out awesome!   Sweet!   Have a lovely week.
Love your new room it's perfect for your workouts and yoga! 🏋‍♂️🧘‍♀️ Glad you're getting closer to the end of your chemo treatments Bec! You have a good man that loves, cares & supports you every inch of the way through your cancer journey. Together you are stronger! Sending you both love & hugs from the USA! ❤🤗
So glad that you posted a video - I have been thinking about both of you a lot this past week and I was so glad to see that you are carrying on, looking amazing and maintaining your positivity while showing your loving audience your vulnerability.  Your dog is the best comic relief!  Lots of love to both of you!
That’s looks fab!
I love when you guys build things your home is beautiful, how ever it does bring me to the question 🙋‍♀️ about permits on houses do y’all need them for in door renovations like this or just outside because I been a fan for a while now and I know y’all are fighting about the deck with permanent peoples . ? Just curious 🧐? Love y’all Bec stay strong girl you got this !!
Love your filming on this video Eamon!  Now I am at 18:00 mins in - and - you are at the table talking about Bec and getting choked up ... Just want to give you (both) a BIG hug/s - you two are phenomenal!  Hang in there - lots of love & support out here for you both ... 😍  Wow - the transformation of the porch is incredible 🤩🤩🤩
Oh my gosh!!! Amazing job!! So great seeing you guys! You guys are 2 of my favourite people 🙂🙂❤️ looking great Bec! Sending lots of positive vibes your way Eamon and Bec!!!
This one is for you Eamon: If— BY RUDYARD KIPLING: If you can keep your head when all about you        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,     But make allowance for their doubting too;    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,     Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,     And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;        If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster     And treat those two impostors just the same;    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken     Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,     And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings     And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings     And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew     To serve your turn long after they are gone,    And so hold on when there is nothing in you     Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,        Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,     If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute     With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,        And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
I missed you guys so much! I love yall! Keep up the great work. Once again, love yall

Love you Bec!! 💐
You guys are simply amazing.
Seriously , I've never laughed as hard as Oso and the (his) couch !!! OMG.....the tears were rolling. Sending lots of good vibes your way.
Thank you Jesus for healing in Rebecca's body, Amen!   BTW.. You know I'm here for Ohso. #MoreOhso He deserves his own channel!
SO very good to see you guys!!! Dog on the couch is awesome!! Lol! Four season rooms are the best!  Love you guys!! ❤️💕🪴💐
Just watched the video. Thanks for showing all the parts you did. “PIVOT!!” nearly caused me to choke!  There are people out there who are inspired by you guys and they way you’re trying to handle everything. You’re doing a good job.  Lots of love to you both.  We know it is very hard and you continue to be a brighter part of the internet.  ❤️
When you use the porch/gym/entry/new room it'll be like a hug from all the family and friends who helped along the way. Thank you for your courage to share the difficulties and the moments of joy; many of us have similar stories and we're traveling right along with you. It's challenging for everyone involved, in very different and no less fraught ways, and I'm sending you and Bec extra tight virtual hugs to add to the well of light and hope and love coming your way.
Oso is hilarious! 🤣😍
so happy to see your video today <3 the room looks insane
I think you should have bought a carton of those head cones for Oso! He's hilarious! I laughed so hard at him trying to keep his claim on the couch,  too.
❤
Great to see the gym team in action and Ozo is soo gorgeous 😍 Becs your coloring is awesome,  best way to keep busy when your energy levels are low. not long and you will be back to par, bless you all
🥰
I enjoyed watching this very much! 😊
Amazing Reno 🥰 so nice to see you two beautiful people and your families 😊.
That room looks amazing, great job!!  Did you have windows put in too or is it still the plexiglass stuff on the windows?  Can you come to my house and make a deck and work out room too?  LOL!
Love what you did! Looks amazing! I send love and light to you both. You both are beautiful people inside and out. I enjoyed this video it made me laugh feel joy and also had some very heart felt moments. Know I think of you both often and wish you all the best. I look forward to more videos. Thank you for all you do.
Amazing, great transformation. Beautiful location. Love watching your channel, dog sofa removal cracked me up, thoughts and preyers  for your health and recovery. ❤️
Finally! I missed you guys. It's been over a month. Thank you!

I am so happy to see Bec looking so beautiful and her parents are awesome! Eamon you are doing it! You are being everything that Bec needs. I am going to continue praying for Bec’s 💯% recovery and healing. Eamon, just know that there are thousands of people praying for you as well. God bless you ❤️ Bear you are precious! Loved how you were trying to keep your sofa 😂😂😂

I’m so glad you adopted Oso. Dogs are wonderful
Eamon, you don’t owe us anything. You have been an amazing partner and I am thankful you are taking care of you. It is really hard to be a caretaker. Bec, you are a warrior!
What can I say, great vlog! Oso/Bear?? Is freaking adorable! How fun to have him around. Bec you are absolutely beautiful! I pray chemo is going as well as it can and that you are continuing to rest and heal!!  Eamon you are such a good husband and dog daddy! No one is forgetting your struggle during these times.

What an amazing transformation for mud room/ workout / yoga / book nook. I love it!!  GREAT JOB!! Love the channel
❤️❤️❤️🇦🇺👍🇦🇺
Loved Oso jumping on the couch to try to keep it!
Wow!  The transformation is amazing!  And Bec is beautiful.  She should have been a model.
So happy to see you guys today. Think of you both so often.  Thanks for sharing Eamon it's not easy to be the one on the sidelines!! Your dog made me laugh so much. Animals are the best.  And that room...like the cabin wasn't beautiful enough. AMAZING what a special place! Take care and sending prayers.
I went through this journey with my husband....it’s the hardest thing I ....we....ever had to do....in so many ways.  Wishing you love and hugs and strength and positivity!!!!! 💕
I need to say thankyou. Because of you I examined myself, found a lump, went straight to the doctor and am scheduled for surgery next week.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are both so unbelievably postive and beautiful people.
Good job Eamon keep it up and know that we root for you and Bec to come back Strong much love 🥰
Great job Eamon.  Sending prayers and love from Louisiana
I love the artistic stuff Bec has been doing. My latest coloring project is a hard cover coloring book (beautiful complex images to color) and in the blank ares I write in it as a journal. Random words, poems, thoughts, etc. I've added stickers too. Art is so calming and can be so therapeutic. You look beautiful and it's great to see you doing something that brings you joy/peace while surrounded by love and beauty
Bec u look so beautiful god bless yall yes helps to stay positive also helps to let go on bad days I m almost 2 years cancer free I still have my bad days I stayed positive for the most part but did also have a few break downs one thing I never did was ask why me had to be a reason we love yall
Its so great to finally 'see' you guys Again! Been praying for you both and wondering how Bec is healing. Its encouraging that you are halfway through, you can say you're on the downhill slope now!!  The porch space looks AH-mazing Eamon!! So impressed with your vision and ability to make it come to life!! 💕
You BOTH got this!  Thanks to the fam for stepping up also!!!!
Thank you so much for sharing! You both are so inspiring, sharing your journey with the world. Your home is so beautiful, what a transformation. Sending Love and Positivity!
Sending you both all my love and best wishes from Sheffield, UK xx ❤️💙
❤
We got our dog a “romper suit”, so he didn’t lick but also didn’t have to put up with a cone of shame 😝 🐕😘
Wow, you guys are just amazing! Thank you soooo much for being so open and raw with this part of your journey. 🇬🇧
GIIIIRL. you look F A N T A S T I C. hair = goodlooking, no hair = just as good lookin, if not a +1. best of health for you both there. stay strong
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH, BEC IS A BADASS AND WILL MAKE IT THRU THIS!!!YOU ARE SO STONG EAMON YOUR HER ROCK AND I KNOW SHE APPRECIATES EVERYTHING YOU DO KEEP UP THE GOOD AND HARD WORK YALL ❤️❤️
I was so happy and relieved to see this video. Continuing to think of both of you every day and sending much love and healing of mind, body and spirit! 💛🌷P.S. Amazing job on the room!
Keep good guys
Thinking of the two of you. Thanks for the update. Keep staying positive. We are all going through struggles in one way or the next but we must stay strong! ❤
OMG it’s Tim!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Continuing to keep you all in prayers and know that you are both in great hands, as you have each other.  Know that it's ok to let those you love see your hurting to.  Cancer is never easy, but it is how you look at each day and find the little things that help you smile.  Even on the bad days.
You probably do t even need a cone anymore, but I am here to inform you that soft cones are the way to go! They attach to the collar so they dont pip off and the dog can navigate their enviornment more easily. Yall are the best! Xoxo
That's a love I want my spouse to show.shes lucky .
Such an inspiring couple, and such a heart warming video. So glad you’re getting up to new projects and staying positive through all the hardships. You two are truly so inspiring! Great job on the room, looks incredible! Missed your videos. Keep on with the good vibes. You’re both doing great ♥️🔥
You guys shine! Love and prayers!!❤️❤️❤️
Missed yall! Much love to both of you ❤️
So good to see you! Also nice to see you surrounded by family during the winter. Sending strengh, patience and calm to both of you, to be used when needed. Feel what you both have been trough.
We love you both, sending hugs, prayers and many blessings your way!!!! Eamon a special prayer for you. I know it’s hard to feel helpless but you are doing all you can for your  hunny bunny. ❤️
Sending prayers and love to you and Bec. ❤
Eamon, don’t put too much on your shoulders. You don’t need to be strong all the time and its ok. When I went thru my cancer treatments, I had asked my husband to be strong. In hindsight, I should’t have asked him that. He was entitled to live his emotions, his reactions to what my body was going through….he was stoic and strong during the cancer treatment rollercoaster ride. Only when all was finished that he experience his emotions….
Omg,I'm going to cry.you are a rock.
Hi Eamon and Bec!! I love your dog!!! Lol. Poor little boy lost his bed. Those cones are awful. If he ever has surgery again there's a round soft collar  they wear and they can't get to the area. Its always so hard to see the people we love going through things as Bec. But, we need to remember it's also hard for the caregiver. It's a helpless feeling. It sucks not being in control of things.  Bec, you are such an amazing strong beautiful woman. Eamon, you are doing everything that anyone could expect. You are a very strong and loving supporter system. Take a little time also for yourself. You have to be physically, emotionally and mentally healthy in order to do the things you need to do. You guys compliment each other so well and the fur baby just makes things more interesting and exciting. All of you did amazing on the room. Take care and thanks for the video!!! You both are in my thoughts and prayers ❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Poor Osso!  He wants the couch to stay and he's trying his best to make sure Tim doesn't leave with it...lol
Great vlog! Way to keep busy during one of life’s unexpected journeys. Bec looks great and she should consider marketing her coloring pictures. They have so much meaning. Just a thought. Hang tough you guys… oh wait, you already r.
You better have replaced that couch with an even better Oso bed!!!
I've been so worried about you both. I'm glad you found something to keep you busy Eamon. Bec, coloring has always been one of my favorite things to do, it's relaxing and cheerful. The room looks amazing Eamon. It's was wonderful seeing your families and Tim of course. I was surprised that Tim didn't help with the room. I'm just so happy to see you up and kinda doing things Bec, but don't over do it. See you Sunday, hopefully next Sunday 🙂. 🙏❤💕💖
Wow what a transformation! You BOTH are so inspirational ❤
Oso is NOT happy you're taking his couch
Love you Bec 🥰
You two are awesome. God bless you.
The friends infusion is hilarious
I loved everything about this video: The porch foamation and renovation, seeing lovely Bec up and around, and honest Eamon.
Bravo! And well done for being a brick.
Fellow Ontarian here!  I have been thinking about you both a lot lately wondering how you are doing so it is great to see your faces! I am in love with Oso, when you took his couch away...PRICELESS.
What a great entrance to a beautiful home. One of Bec’s coloring pages should be framed and hung there. Would look so beautiful in that space!
I love you guys! You are such genuine good people who I look up to very much. Sending you both lots of love. Great job Eamon - you inspire me to look for beauty where there is none. I whish I had the skills and creativity you have! Beautiful drawings Bec :) Good to hear that you are doing well!
27:30 do we have an update on the building inspector and the platforms/stairs outside going down to water?
i love you guys i think about you two everyday ❤️❤️❤️. I know Bec will be just fine soon with the Eamonator by her side ❤️
During a very very hard and traumatizing time in my life I was having some sort of vulnerable conversation with my father. At some point I told him that I am striving to be a rock. I wish I could quote the exact words but its been too long. He told me to be a tree. A rock is not as as strong as we believe. Its under pressure, it is limited to movevemwnt and growth, and that the more the rock goes through the more life chips if away. He told me to be a tree. A tree can go through so many hardships but it keeps adapting and growing. If may be missing a limb or have a scare, but despite everything it keeps growing/living.   During stressful times I love to get out into nature of be near trees or other plants. I find them so grounding. 💚
Sending positive vibes, love and prayers 🙏 ❤ 💖 💕
Wow! The gym looks awesome, well done eamon and family of helpers :) so nice to spend Sunday with you guys again, sending love and kindness to you both! ✨
💌💌
Absolutely love the transformation Eamon (and friends/family). So good to see both of you smiling and laughing. Healing vibes to you both. ❤️🤗❤️
It's  good to see you Love you both very much you are in my prayers
Looks great! Sending healing thoughts your way...
So nice to see you guys! you should have just put pants on oso because he seems to be just destroying the cones lol
Beautiful! Great design! So glad to see an update on Bec - you’re amazing lady. All the best love, light, and healing ❤️‍🩹
Love you both and of course Bear ! xxx
You are both great people and lucky to have each other. And that dog is a beauty x
It looks amazing! You guys are so strong and brave!!
Oh my goodness, the scenes with Oso and the couch were so precious.  I loved it.  Smiles all around.
Wow so lovely to see you both working together ❤ cabin is looking sweet. Much love to you both xxx
Congratulations Bec for completing 1/2 Chemo treatment!  I know the side effects can zap your energy at times.  Have to say you're looking good and your precious smile shows your positivity. Eamon, expressing his feelings shows what he has been experiencing. Eamon, revealing what he's been through  may help someone else to realize it's okay to be human, and they can make it through too.  A good treatment plan, knowledgeable doctor, family/friend support, nutritious diet, determination, positive attitude, sense of humor, and of course a lot of prayer is the best way to achieve good results. You two look so good. Your workout room looks so nice and well organized.  Oh yeah, Bec, I think you've now been promoted to supervisor!  Whip that guy into shape!🤣  Take as much down time as needed and then some.  We viewers will always be here for you.  Sending warm, fuzzy 🤗🤗 and lots of 🥰😍.  God bless you both.  CarrieJo/PA
Continued prayers.  The place looks awesome.
The gym looks amazing, even I want to go and work out there 😂😅. You are doing great guys, glad to see you staying so positive! And Eamon thanks for opening up, thanks for being Bec's rock for all of us. Sending you lots of love!
Thank you for the honesty. The pain is obvious but so is the love.  Your boy oso is the best !
Great to see everyone again! (especially Adam…no hurt feelings, right Eamon)😘
Every Sunday as I have my morning coffee, I look for your vlog. So happy to see you both! Oso is so sweet. Love and light to you both!!!
Eamon & Bec - Thanks on the update on how y'all are doing. Your pouch project looks great! It's good to see Bec and continued prayers for her & you. Love to see positivity in all what you're doing!
Great job guys 🐶💕
What a pleasant Sunday morning surprise! Great to see that Bec's doing well and rocking the 'head' look, beautifully. Eamon, you're such a loving trooper and a role model for young men. ❤✌😎
I don’t normally message you but rest assured I think of you both regularly wishing you the very best from the other side of the world 💪
Sending prayer and strength... your half way there.. you got this

Well done Becs and Eamon too. You are playing a stormer. Blessings and healing.
Oh Eamon I’m sending you love and light.  I can’t imagine what this must be like for you.  I think adopting your dog and revamping your porch looks a lot like thriving in spite of what you and Bec are going through.  You’re both beautiful.  Love you so Much
I understand what you are going through Eamon as my partner had immunotherapy for his cancer. His treatment is over and the cancer has shrunk but still in his body. Every six months he has a body scan for an update and then 3-4 weeks after that waiting for his results. Send you both a virtual hug xx xx
Bec please take it easy. Love seeing Eamon open up! I sure have missed you both.
I’m pretty sure I’m obsessed with Oso! He’s so funny & such a good boy! But thank you for posting a video. We always look forward to seeing you guys. Eamon, you’re an incredible partner to Bec. You both are so incredibly strong. Thank you for your vulnerability! As always, sending ALL of our strength and love. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Get your rest Bec & Don't feel guilty for any time you need it!! But Damn i do wish a god speedy recovery so we don't have to continue watching Eamon struggle with content while you are resting  🤣 😀 😉 I pray for both of you every night!!! We all Do I'm sure ❤️ much love! Cyber hugs too! ✌️
Yay!!!  Tim!
Hi Guys, much love and support from UK. Think keeping busy is a great medicine sometimes and if the results are as good as you achieved in this video then what a bonus. Bet the spray foam made quite a big difference. Do you think you will be doing double glazed windows in the gym room one day too? I sooooo look forward to your vlogs and to know you are both doing ok. Seems like your family and friend's support is great and you are doing so much for each other. Take care and big hugs......
🙏🙏🙏🙏💪✌✌💖🎅🚌🌻👍
Bear helping with the couch has to be one of the funniest scenes I've EVER watched! You are so right, gotta stay busy to survive. My dad died in my arms a few days ago after caring for him for seven years. Life, illness, working together, it's all so much to learn to handle, but you have the key, just keep moving. Sending you both heaps more love and hope as well as thanks for making my life brighter.
I was so happy when I saw your Instagram saying you were posting...i know everything is so hard atm and my lips quiver when I think... so to find the energy on top of what's going on...well you are both inspirational! Room LOOKS FANTASTIC,  OJO IS HILARIOUS,  totally made himself at home! Bec halllllllfffffffff waaaaaayyyyyyy through wooo AMAZINGGGGGG👏🙀😯 . LOVE YOU BOTH AND HUGS TO YOU BOTH, A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN AS THE SAYING GOES ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️  IM A SOP I KNOW  X
Fantastic to the two of you again. Incredible job on the storage area transformation to "gym mode" Eamon. It was brave of you Eamon to share your feelings on how you've been managing to stay strong for Bec. We all love ya buddy. Your a real hero. Happy to see Bec is doing well despite the Chemotherapy. Looking forward to see you both again.
Aww, guys!! It’s so lovely to see you again 🥰🥰 You’ve been in my thoughts loads… Thank you for this amazing and fun update. I’m so glad you’re doing well with the the treatments Bec and taking good care of yourself (love the mandalas!). Wishing you continued success and good health 💚💗💚 Osso is hilarious - I’m glad he’s around for you guys right now.  Love also to Eamon for what you’re dealing with and major props for the transformation of the porch, it looks sick, dude! 😃👍🏻👏🏻🎉
Much love brotha. Stay strong
you two are simply amazing! Thank you both for your honesty and letting us be a part of your journey. Continuing sending positive thoughts  and hugs your way!!! ...and also: great job with the entrance/gym ;-)
This video just...MADE ME SMILE THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH!  Luv you guys! Sending healing energy to BOTH OF YOU.
I'm not sure of your beliefs, but I find these scriptures have power within them. I believe they are CRUCIAL TRUTH'S that every being on Earth should know of, as everyone of us are affected by our own, and others words, and thoughts, just as much as deeds!  (Proverbs 18:21)  - “The tongue has the power of life and death.” The stakes are high. Your words can either speak life, or your words can speak death. Our tongues can build others up, or they can tear them down. (Philippians 4:8-9) 8 Finally, [a]believers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable and worthy of respect, whatever is right and confirmed by God’s word, whatever is pure and wholesome, whatever is lovely and brings peace, whatever is admirable and of good repute; if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think continually on these things [center your mind on them, and implant them in your heart]. 9 The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things [in daily life], and the God [who is the source] of peace and well-being will be with you. (Sending you both love, positive thoughts, words and prayers. I have no doubt God has a big propose for you both! He has planned a long, and healthy life for Bec! This experience with cancer, and the rough treatment process is a lesson. A whole new set of tools to do what we're put her for, to help others in need along the pathway of life. True understanding only comes from experience. Our experiences, especially ones we view as negative, is how empathy is truly gained. As we all know, walking in someone else's shoes is the best way to help someone through a rough patch. Can't wait to see your future videos. Even the ones long after Bec's recovery! 💕
Eamon and the dog....cant stop laughing, bec hope you are doing ok,   its great all your familly rally round to help. Loved this vlog.
💕💕💕💕💖💖💖💖💖
Omg Osso and the couch 🥰💓
The room is on point! Also, your monstera is looking gorgeous 😍
The room looks terrific! Sending hugs to both of you for continued strength and healing. Oso is a complete panic -- had me literally laughing out loud more than once in this video, especially with the great sofa caper.
Great to see you both again, missed you guys ❤️🤗 The porch looks amazing 😎👍
And, Eamon.... it's so wonderful to see a caring & loving man to his partner.... you are doing a great job through all of this, as well.  Bec, I hope that you are feeling a bit better through all you are going through.... I hope your beautiful home gives you calm & peace and the gorgeous lake views are meditative for you.  Sending you so much strength & care.  Wish we could all help you guys, but know that you are both in our positive thoughts!  : )  : )  : )
Bec, You look beautiful!!! You both are such a beautiful couple . Ramon is doing such a great job being supportive!! We wish the absolute best and are praying for you both. Love Joe and Kathy Clayton, Albertville, mn
FANTASTIC JOB YOU GUYS!!! So happy to see you doing better Beautiful Bec! So so much love and light coming at you!!!! 😍🥰😍🥰
💕💕
we love you too and wish you so much beautiful sunshine days as possible. Thank you for all!
The Oso clips are some of the best entertainment I’ve seen in a while.
Again. I can’t understand why u went the destructive chemo route.  There r natural healthy ways to cure cancer. Ivermectin & many other things shown on TikTok.   I think u r going to find out the very hard way   It destroys your immune system forever. Even if chemo works it’s only short lived.
💞
Love your videos, any video, and follow you two lovely people ❤️ Big hug and lots of love XO
Eamon even after receiving the good news I habitually mentally went to those dark places. And that’s what it had become..a habit! And it was when I realized that I was able to put my “changing bad habits” hat on.
What a fantastic job it looks amazing. So happy to see your smiling faces. Sending you both lots of love and encouragement
Sweet porch.  Lexan may be an issue during the winter but not sure if expensive multi layer windows would be much better.
Amazing to see Bec doing so well!!! Eamon is as inventive as ever with the porch!! Love to see you two support each other. You remind me that there are truly good people in this  world. See ya Sunday!
Just reading some of the comments on here and I must say you lot are amazing  this group of subscribers are some of the most caring and beautiful people I have came across on any page
So awesome to see you both again and loving how great Bec is doing. I pray it will be over for you soon Bec and then you both can start on your next journey of little Bec’s and little Eamon’s, you both rock, good luck 🍀👍🏼 and best wishes to you both. Your such an inspiration Bec. 🙏🏻🥰🙏🏻
Missed seeing you guys, but I also know that this is a time for healing for Bec & that is the most important.  Please let Bec know that we are all thinking of her & wish her only positive during this time.  From all of us, to you both.....  hugs & support!
surely you need some proper windows in there
💖💖💖💖
Hugs from Brantford
I am in awe how you two manage to put out the most uplifting, heartwarming and real videos despite going through such difficult times.  And I am utterly in love with your dog.  You mentioned in a video that he was a “foster” but I am so hoping that he is a “foster fail” because he brings you  and us so many smiles.
Praying for you Bec🙏🏻 Fantastic upgrade👍 Very glad to see you guys again. Stay safe👍 B Deacon Manitoba Canada 🇨🇦
You are an amazing husband. You are an amazing man. You are an amazing friend. You are amazing to do this together.
Is Oso your dog or someone else?
Eamon you are a freaking proooooo 💪🏼 I love you guys, you make my Sundays better
wahaha two minutes in and I was dying of laughter with Oso - how hilarious
Wow the room looks amazing 😍 now just need a kick as speaker system to blast that work out music baby. Glad you all are well Bec I'm glad your doing so well and eamon you as well. tuff situation you guys are going through but glad it's all gonna be over soon Bec just a little bit more to go girl you got it! you guys got this. Love you both hope to see you Sunday
LOOOVE you Eamon and Bec. I am rooting and praying and sending positive energy your way. You two are STRONG! much  love from a momfam from Suriname South America
May God grace you with waves of healing Bec. Lovely job on the exercise room.😉
The last time I'm going to repeat myself. Do not do chemotherapy. Instead have doctor inject vitamin C into blood stream. Works identically as to chemo MINUS side effects. Surprised you guys haven't researched it or clueless about it since are health nuts. Doctors will admit it IF ONLY asked. I researched the hell out of holistic therapy when my mom was diagnosed 4 stage and EVERY doctor said YES it's facts. But they're not going to suggest it since they don't profit on it and want to kill you for their profit. But go ahead... Ruin your health. May make more YouTube money
Great to see all the new exciting things in your life.  More than half chemo done and a new exercise /entrance area. Fantastic!!!
So glad to see you we have kept you in our ♥️ hearts , both of you! Bec looks amazing bald.
Random thought. You guys are very public with your cabin videos. Do you hear from the previous owners? What do they think about the changes to the cabin/property?
PIVOT !!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Awesome honesty—that’s why we love you guys & routing for you!!!
Wow! the porch looks amazing! The weight wall is super cool! And glad to see that ur energy has been up Bec. Sending well wishes and good vibes to both of you.
Love and prayers being sent from myself in Northern Ireland to you pair of beautiful people and bear lol
Amazing video eamon and becks, great work on the gym room too with help from the family….love n hugs from 🇬🇧🥰
Oso and his cone had me literally LOLING. Sending love
The room looks awesome.Stay blessed both of you
I love you guys. Great work on the screened in porch. Can’t wait for the future.
Thanks for the update.  Missed you guys. We worry.  (you took Ouzo’s couch. Ugh)
Eamon I can relate to your story I have cared for my wife for 13 yrs she's disabled and I struggle with the mental side of my life a lot the physical side I'm fine it's just constantly seeing the one you love in pain is tough to watch I try to empty my head in the gym and sauna and try to charge my mental battery 🔋.
OMG! 🤣Oso and that couch! 🤣
Wow amazing transformation. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on your journey with cancer x
all the love Aemon! 🙌
Courage 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love seeing you both, thank you for sharing and you are both amazing and strong! 🧡
So great to see you guys and Bec's beautiful face! Think about you guys a lot. Love Oso. What a character. I felt badly for him about the couch ... that was so sad!
Though our stories have similarities,  there are some differences. Each journey is individual but also a part of the familial collective! At33 yrs old with 3 kids I was diagnosed with stage 2 I fought hard through my BC diagnosis only to be diagnosed 6 months after my last treatment with stg 4 endo, followed by 2 years of fighting for my life. I watched your stories through all my treatment and surgeries and your positive energy gave me just what I needed to get through I am still in recovery at 1 year post hysterectomy and some days are harder than others but I still find myself looking to your videos for strength but also emotional permission....we alway have people telling us, we will back and better than ever but in the moment all we feel is sick, or tired so when I need that cry, the permission to vulnerable I know I can sit with you (even just in a video) and cry however long I need to. You two are absolutely beautiful, your story and life are inspiring. We will continue to light a candle for you on sundays and keep you in our prayers every day!! Untill next time, pause catch your breath and pause again  until the world steadies itself under your feet! Lots of love!
That looks great, but even more importantly is seeing both of you. I've been wondering how you were doing. Thank you for sharing your journey with all of us. Positive thoughts and hugs for you guys 💖, also please hug the pup for me, he's definitely a keeper ❤️🙂
So glad to see you Sweet Bec! You two are a brave couple, great job as always. We admire you … you certainly Eamon&Becikify and make everything beautiful and better than you find it. Sending lots of Love and blessings from Argentina 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Oh my god 🥺 Bec is half way done.  I am sooo happy for you girl. You look beautiful as always and you are so strong. Sending ❤️.
I’ve missed you guys and Tim too
Bec...I'm sending you ❤ a big dose of love and strength & POSITIVE THOUGHTS about your happy future living in the beautiful home you and Eamon built  ~  one day you will add  your beautiful children to your loving home  🏡 💕
Hilarious watching Osso’s antics.  Hope I spelt his name correctly.. guess he wasn’t happy with the settee (couch) going.. Glad to see you back on the screen, fully understand why you’re not posting so often x
It’s so great seeing you two, I have missed your videos. Bec you looking good,girl. You two like to keep busy fixing up your adobes (meaning what you are living in). Take care you two
Oso on the couch was so hilarious 🤣
Okay, that dog jumping on the couch when you were trying to move it, hysterical!!  Bec is still a ray of sunshine, my sister fought a hard battle with breast cancer and won, I am positive Bed will be the same, prayers!
What an amazing YouTube!   So thankful you two are in this world and letting us into your lives.  Can’t wait to see you in the nice weather enjoying the beautiful home and life you have created.  And for Bec to be finished with her treatments!
Looks stunning?...
Your doing a great job taking care of your wife. Stay strong you got this. I'm praying for you all. 🙏 God bless from Michigan
Cutest rap of all time No need for anymore applications. I ran it back to show half the house
thanks for the video looks cabin amazing, so happy to see you keep both just keep smiling whatever lemons life throws at you. you inspire me to keep strong and keep fighting with my own lemons.
You bring such joy to everyone. If only the world were filled with as much love as you have for each other and your subscribers have for the two of you. Always thinking of you guys!
I love seeing the changes in the cabin overtime. It really is a special place. ❤️❤️ much love! Eamon, it was very brave of you to open up to us, Bec is lucky to have you. And Bec, I admire your strength so much!
I was so excited to see the video post today I got so excited.  Well the porch room transformation looks absolutely beautiful, Oso is a hoot and so cute, so he got neutered oh well it happens also you can see he knows Bec don’t feel good, animals can tell it’s just something about them.  Bec all things considered, you look fabulous and you are half way there that is great you have to know all the love and prayers we have for you sending lots and lots of love and prayers and I pray with the blood of Jesus that this invasion into your body be lifted out and clear from you and that the remaining treatments go smooth for you Amen,  now Eamon you are a beautiful loving person to your Bec and to all you know, we all want and need to be strong for the person we love and it is ok to break down from time to time tears run but they help clear emotions from us and that is ok too …I do know what you are going through and what you feel I’ve been there and done that with my late husband ….I do believe it is and will be the hardest thing you will have to ever encounter in your life but I’m sending my love and prayers to you too because we all need that sometimes more than other times…continue to send love and prayers for you both you are so beautiful 🤩 and loving and that’s why we all love you both so much ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🌈🌈🌈🐕🐕🐕❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shes kicking ass and taking names, you will both come through the other side
Much aloha and prayers for the both of you 🙏🌺🌿 I 👀 you rockin' da Spurs 🤙
Just awesome sauce! (Stay fierce, Bec!)
Ok I need to know your peloton leaderboard name!!
Love you guys!
💓💓💓🌸🌸💓💓💓🌸🌸🌿🌱🌿🌸🌸💓💓⚘
Love you both! 💖 🙏
So glad to see y'all again. It's good to see that Bec is doing well and is getting through her treatments. This video was great. Eamon and team did a wonderful job!
Bec's dad and mom taking over bec's paint shop 😆 Oh i miss you guys so bad, love to see your video every now and then ❤️
Such a cool room!  Love you guys and so nice to see your faces. Hope you are cozy and feeling the love today!
❣️💕💘💖💗💓💞
Good to see you guys ❤ Oso has such a camera presence 😂
So glad to see you this Sunday! Another awesome video! Sending love and prayers your way!
Love to see it!! Wish you all love and light ❣️ stay blessed stay strong
Porch is outstanding  you two are the best team sometimes one member has more weight to pull but that is okay speaking from experience. My husband was sick off and on most of the 21 years we were together no regrets looking after someone to me was my privilege we were the best team as the two of you are and you can do this together .You can get through anything working together some days are harder but partnership is key to giving strength to one that needs it.Everyday is a great day ! You two are young and strong you will get through this. Oso is too funny how can you not laugh at him reminds me of my husband we laughed everyday even on the bad days . Spring is on its way great things coming smell the lake and the trees greening up lots to look forward to Oso in the lake 😀😍🐶!
At minute 18 I started crying. Had to pause to make a comment. You are so open and honest about your feelings. You guys are my favorite YouTube channel for that reason. I am continuing to Pray for both of you everyday. Much Love ❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Osso wanted that couch!!
I'm so happy to see you two, again. Sundays just haven't been the same but I'm so glad you've both taken some time to yourselves the last few weeks. You deserve a break. We love you. Lots of love and healing sent from your neighbor in good Ole Minnesota. 💙
It's so good to see Tim again! Prayers to you both. It's a hard journey for you both. I'm so glad you both have each other and your support system. You both are Rockstars.
Was thinking of you both and wondering how you are doing. Looking good. Prayers and hugs
My all time favorite YouTube people! Love the positive outlook you both have, & not just because of this season of your life, but always. You two have really created such a beautiful home and life for yourselves. So glad to see TIM too!!!!  Side note: you should totally get a squirrel feeder off Amazon since puppers likes to watch the birds. They attach to the window and it’s a see thru acrylic type ‘house’ and the squirrels sit in it and eat, and dogs go crazy for them! People post them on TikTok and it’s so cute!
Great job!!! Im super interested in your journey and think about you often. Any chance you want to share your peloton names? Id love to follow you there.
You have my heart guys 💕❣💙 xx
You guys are actually amazing!!! I have missed the videos so much but to see Bec slowly but surely making her way through her chemo journey is actually so uplifting and amazing 💛  And to Eamon, all I can say is that you are amazing! you keep yourself motivated and keep pushing on through the tough times!!!  love you guys💛💛
Amazing! Inspirational!
It's cool good to see you two again. I missed you. I pray for you & am glad to hear that you're half way thru the chemo treatments, Bec. I am sending only positive loving thoughts your way! Your extra new room looks GREAT!! You Two hang in there and know inside how much love is coming your way! Lean on the Lord and our Heavenly Father. See you, hopefully next Sunday. 🙏🙏👍love & hugs always, Sharon in Indiana.
You comments about how hard it is for you, Eamon, let me cry. My 41 year old daughter had stage 4 breast cancer and I know from my heart and soul how difficult it is for the whole family. It was wonderful to see Bec fighting her way through.  You are blessed with family who add their support. And the dog brings lots of comic relief!  Your porch space is absolutely beautiful!  Can I come over?😂 (I live in Tennessee.). You’ve really transformed that cabin over this time.. 1 year?  Two years?  I can’t remember. I’m also glad that you have lots of projects to keep you busy.  Hugs, love and prayer for you and Bec.
It’s difficult seeing our sunny Bec feeling tired and worn out.  Praying for you two.  Feel better real soon Bec.  You’re beautiful, you’re strong, you’re a blessing!
WOW THAT ROOM THOUGH!  amazeballs Eamon! and helpers of course.  Been thinking about you both so much.  Sending all the love and healing energy.  You got this!  Hugs from Windsor Ontario (don't hold it against me, hehe)
🙏🙏🙏🥰 sending you both and your family and friends blessings and positive thoughts to carry you all through each day. 🤗
Guys, you are such a strong couple. You can get through this I know you can. Bec is so much stronger than she even realizes. Love & Blessings from Nova Scotia, Canada 🇨🇦❤
So happy to view your new post.  I kept checking and was quite worried about your welfare.  Phew!  Loved every minute of it.  Thank you! You are both such strong and unique people.  Your love for one another is inspiring. You are both in my prayers. ❤🙏 PS The room is a-MAZ-ing as Bec would say. 👏👏👏
🌻
Love you guys❤❤❤
Eamon, see that u get professional help/ support too!!!! Love to u both!!
Love you so much
Eamon you are a started Beck you are the sunshine. You are both so brave, love your videos
Never in my life have I been happy crying for the length of a whole YouTube video but I just missed you guys so much and was so happy to see you. My dogs think I’m overly dramatic but I really want you guys to be better soon and that makes me already tear up again. Fuck cancer. Sending an unrealistic amount of digital love your way!
Aw Eamon. I think you need some virtual hugs and some real prayers. You are both doing phenomenal. Half way thru. You’ll get thru. And I laughed so hard about your dog. Love him. A good addition.
As a man who is married to and in love with a woman with health issues ( depression, anxiety, addiction) I can tell you that letting go of control is the hardest thing to do! Counseling has been a blessing. It’s never a bad impedance to ask for help. A healthy Eamon makes for a happier Bec.  Prayer 🙏 helps me too.  God bless you both.
You two are amazing. Thanks a lot for this update. 💕
I have been thinking of you two! Eamon, I have been the one to have to stay strong for others so I kept myself busy as well and realized I never actually processed what I was going through. Once Bec is all done with chemo and better, I encourage you to find your peace and find a way to process everything. When I’m in the thick of it, I just have to keep going, but once everything is done then I break down. I don’t know if it’s therapy or what but we love you and want to make sure you deal with your pain and find your peace 🕊  Bec, you are such a beautiful light! 🤍 to see those smiles even when you hurt so much is so beautiful. Sending you so much love, light, and strength so you continue to shine. Laughter is so healing, may the two of you find laughter throughout your dark days! I love you 🤍  …also Oso is a hoot! What a blessing that he came into your lives when he did! 🙏
YOU guys are both so amazing and strong through this journey. Love, love, love the new room!!! Sending healing prayers and good wishes to you both.
So glad to see Beck smiling! (My thoughts are with you, Eamon…you’re going through a tough time, too.)
Great reno Eamon. So awesome to see Bec up and about. Glad you shared your experience too❤️❤️
I’m so sorry you are both going through this. I am praying for you both. That dog loved that couch. Lol I think you should adopt this dog. He just fits with you both and you can tell he makes you both so happy. 🙏🏻❤️
You two are amazing!!! Bec's family is so cool! Sending love from Montana!
So wonderful to see you guys on this Sunday morning. Watching Oso 'claim' and defend his couch had us in stitches. The end result of the porch room is amazing and so inviting. Eamon, you rock. Bec, your strength is legendary. Love you guys and think about you so often. Hugs and best wishes!
Praying for you every day, you will kick cancers ass
It looks beautiful! I know it is harder than you show Bec.  But you are awesome and, a super strong woman.  God bless you 🙏 both.❤
So exciting to see you both! Thanks for sharing your heart with us. Feeling for Oso’s couch being gone. Such a beautiful job on the room!
I get that, Eamon. I HATE opening up. It makes me feel so raw. And you probably feel guilty saying anything while Bec is suffering. But you are NOT selfish for opening up. She would want you to!
Your room renovation looks great.  Nice to see Tim again.  Just a bit of information that most people aren't aware of, if Bec or any of you have to get a blood draw, ask the technician to only take half vials or quarter vials.   The majority of your immune system is in your blood and blood draws effectively remove part of your immune system so the less they take, the better.  They only need a small amount for tests and the rest gets thrown away. Sending you guys lots of love and support.
Sending healing energy to Bec and great job Eamon on the renovations.
Oh man, it looks so good! Also, Osso jumping back on the couch as Tim was taking it away was the BEST (albeit a little sad 😭). I’ve just prayed for you both - for healing, for strength, for continued courage… and for God to show Himself in ways only you will recognize. ♥️
So inspirational on so many levels! 🇨🇦
Eamon you doing a good job being supportive. Continue to be her strong person.  Even tho at times it's overwhelming. I love how you guys relationship is happy. I'm jealous 😊 you 2 have relationship that I wish I had. Bec let's kick this cancer butt💪! Thanks to all the  helpers that are helping you there. That's love! Be strong  Eamon and Bec! 💝✌😘
Been thinking of you and pushing positive thoughts your way. Glad to see you two keeping on keeping on. Thank you sooooo much for Oso & the couch; I got a real good laugh out of that! Poor Oso..... my pup loves their mobile couch, aka the car, but she loves the immobile one as well.
bless you both❤
Love you guys... thanks for making our Sundays
Oso! So funny!
Good to see you building again and being creative. Eamon, you are a great dude, you Love Bec and treat her with respect and dignity. Your dog Is cool. It helps to have your Friends and Family around. You will get through this, both of you. And get back to your lives. It might even be better. Tell Bec that she is Soooooo beautiful and Loved by all of us. This will just make the bond between you and her unbreakable... stronger than anything. You two are Amazing, Awesome and Loved.
Being a caregiver of a loved one going through their tough battles is hard.  Praying for you and Bec!!!  We all need an outlet when we are caring for a loved one.
Do ya'll have a P.O. Box? I would love to send some coloring books your way! :)
Eamon, thank you for opening up about your emotions and being vulnerable with us. It’s not an easy thing to do, I can tell. I just want to say that I can see a lot of growth in you since I started watching this channel, and I am truly touched by seeing how loving, supportive, and present you are with Bec during this difficult time. Bec is a bona fide warrior. Her positivity and determination, her strength and courage, her light! She’s incredible. I’ll continue to keep you both in my thoughts and prayers.  You’ve got this guys! I really believe that. Love from Ohio 💜
Awesome to see the family coming together to create this gorgeous space. It will be something to cherish for years to come. Thinking of you always and praying for you, loads of love from Malta 🇲🇹
Y'all are both absolutely inspiring. Send my love from Tennessee 💕
OMG Oso didn't want the couch to leave 😂🤣😂🤣
Oh Eamon Eamon Eamon.......... It's hard to put into words what's happening with you and Bec. The dynamic you have together is incredible, yet we know there are personal moments and struggles that are ongoing and are possibly either too personal or just mentally and spiritually hard to articulate.  And you don't need to try.  Thankyou for sharing what you do buddy. Your YT family sees the look in your eye and the pain on your face. And we would take on that burden if we could, because you've let us in so close that we worry and pray for both you and your families. God be with you 💚
Loved to see the notification this morning! So proud of you both! Thank you for showing the good and the bad, and for humbling us with you incredible hearts!!! Love you both!
Awww I told you Oso would be part of the family if he was with you guys when you went through all this <3 he's perfect for you guys.
Eamon, you can shave your head to be like Bec!
So glad you put this video out today; I have had you guys on my heart and mind.  I'm glad to see everyone well. The room looks amazing!!  Stay Strong both of you will make it through this journey only stronger.  Hugs!!

Omg I was thinking of u guys, 3 days ago I found out I got vocal cord cancer and I just turned 35 yesterday. It maid me think of u, I'm so scared and now I know what your going through. Love u guys.
Eamon, what a rough time! Hold tight, not everything can be under control but be sure that whatever do and however you feel is just ok. Lots of good vibes to you, your project and of course All the very best to Bec!!! Hey why that weird French accent??? Bises de France!!
Where’s Tim’s yoga 🧘 jeggins’? 😭
Love u guys so much praying for u both!!
I know this may sound odd, but I was thinking about you two today! I'm hoping that Bec is doing better and I'm praying every day for your full recovery! It's odd how I learned about you two, from your friends, Nate and Kara and so glad I subscribed. The adventures that I have been on are the only way this 68-year-old woman would be able to see the world! Just because I only started a few months ago, doesn't mean I haven't watched your other videos. I've gone back to watch most of them up to this point. The food you love and friends you've met along the way has been very enjoyable! Enjoy your life together, get better, and I love you both!!💞
Sending Lots of ♥♥♥♥♥🥰🤗🤗
I am so glad to see you guys !!!!!! 😃🥰🥳

Best wishes from Malta to you both .stay strong xx
Wow! What a transformation of your entrance way. Love u guys!
Dude It's been a long time no see but I understand what's going on. Trent and Allie have been sending out Aloha for Bec, and that's been great. Aloha Nui Loa from Hawaii kiddo's.
Sending love and prayers y’all way. It’s rough on spouse like patient. And I am sending love to both of you
A great video!  Excellent renovation and truly wonderful to see Bec doing well!!!  Your brother looks so much like you... sort of an Eamon version 2.  The "bear" is a real scene stealer.
Whohoo! So happy to see you guys! You were missed! The "new" room looks great, Bear needs a "replacement sofa". Perhaps his own "easy chair"? The crunch wrap looks delish, ?in your cookbook? Till next time, keep on doin' what ya' been doin', it's working very well. HUGS!
Nice job 👍
I missed you guys so much!! Thak tou for this amazing way to spend my Sunday! Lots of love ❤
you had me crying Emon  ,to have a person you love  go through this is tough   and you can't fix it and feel helpless,just know being there is what she needs God bless you both
I hope Bec watched this and laughed as hard as I did watching Oso Bear and Eamon!  😂 😆 Those two are a brilliant comedy team! You made me cry Eamon and so good to see beautiful Bec. 💛💛💛
How can I get a membership to access that gym? Looks great.
Love you guys keep you in our prayers 😇 and so glad 😊 to see her beautiful smile!!! And Eamon 💯 ROCK for her 😊!! Just love to see you see you guys 😍!!

I look forward to seeing both your beautiful faces every Sunday.  Bec you are an incredible woman full of grace and strength. Eamon you have  amazing talent for making people laugh. :)
You could also put another layer of plexiglass so it’s like double glazed
Oso provided me with much joy today. Thank you!
Love and prayers to Bec..great job Eamon!
Positive thoughts coming your way!
It’s such a hard and scary road to have to travel. You have an amazing support system. Hang in there. Lots of 💕
I missed you guys! 🧡

Eamon you are a solid dude. My heart goes out to you when you opened up. Stay busy bro, chemo will be over soon. Nice job on your loft. You inspire me to be a better husband. Take care of that girl!
It looks amazing guys! ❤️to you both.
Beck!!! We love you!!
Keep your faith, my daughter is going on 10 years with stage for breast cancer. And she had a remission a couple years where she had a baby. And to think that they had only given her eight months to live at the age of 30. Have faith never let go❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1st you don't anyone anything. You have shown what a partner who truly loves and supports their loved one does. I am glad you can keep busy  but never forget to feel the emotions and work through them. We all just adore you and Bec.   Much love and Bec you are one hell of a fighter.
Amazing space, like the rest of your house! Sending hugs and positive vibes over the pond, to you both x
Cancer affects anyone who loves and supports you. It's good you are keeping yourselves healthy too. Very self aware. Praying for each of you. I have pictures of my dad on a couch he loved that was hauled away of him on it in a back of a truck. Thanks for stirring up that memory for me.
Absolutely love this room, you all did such beautiful work. Bec if you listen to audible books can you Please, Please, Please listen to The Iodine Crisis by Lynne Farrow. It is such a huge eye opener about her cancer journey and how iodine helped her. I also bought her book as well to bring to my Naturapath to show her. I can't recommend this book enough for everyone to read. Big hugs to you both.
Osos a gem 💎 And I missed you guys ❤️❤️❤️
Loving Oso. Glad Bec is well and we all know how tough she is. Especially glad to see Eamon keeping busy doing DIY stuff. Loving 🥰 to see you guys just living life making the most out the cabin. 👫🏻🐕🏡
I am so impressed with the build, the honesty, and sending lots of healing to your whole family. Cancer sucks but positive energy kicks its butt. You all rock!
Oso and the couch is my cats any time I make a bed.
I love your videos so much.  Keep up the great work. I will keep you in my prayers and thoughts. I love you all so much.
Poor Oso losing his comfortable couch!  Than getting neutered...  So wonderful that you guys have so much help with the remodeling.  KEEP STRONG BEC. Eamon your doing fantastic.  It's always the hardest being the support person, because you just want your loved one better. You guys take care and thank-you for sharing with us.
Love and prayers to you both. You are a beautiful couple, and so lucky to have each other to lean on, and hold up. Bless you both.
Bec this looks good on you👍😁

Have the chills
Poor Orso lost his couch. He seems to have bounced back nicely. Love you guys and your strength is amazing. Blessings and Light to you both.
Is there anything Eamon can't do?  So talented.
It’s during times like these that we discover our strengths and weaknesses. You are both doing as much as you can and having your friends and family with you makes it easier.  Prayers going out for your healing and peace Bec and Eamon for your strength and peace of mind.  The 4 season room is really looking awesome!
So happy to see you this Sunday! :) the room looks amazing and the crunch wraps look delicious!!
Y'all are inspirational for those of us struggling in tough caregiver situations. I can relate to the "Eamon and Oso" show more than you know, and the importance of keeping busy/motivated/focused. Thank you for opening up your hearts.
Bec, you’ve been in my heart these past few weeks. Wishing you all the best in this journey. Eamon, keep loving on this beautiful woman. Hugs from New Hampshire🥰
Eamon, if I could jump through the computer screen and hug you I would. Opening up the way you did was so beautiful. You and Bec will get through this together and it will make you stronger than ever. Love you both and praying hard. ❤️❤️❤️❤️PS. I love your video editing skills!!! Absolutely amazing, so creative!!!
We LOVE you guys Eamon! I'm so grateful that you both have wonderful families. ☺💕

Your videos are very clever and entertaining.  Thank you for opening up, it is never easy seeing the devastating effects of Chemo and wanting to take their suffering upon yourself instead...trust you are doing exactly what she needs.  You two are a gift to so many... blessings to you and Bec.

Love wach I’m praying for beck
Wish you well bec
The mama in me has been worried and checking every day for updates on how y’all were doing. The workout room looks amazing, you did a great job!  Just know there’s a redhead in North Carolina is keeping both of you in prayer. ❤️
The room looks so good! 👍🏻 Also seeing Bec working on it, dancing and smiling is a gift. Eamon.. you are a rock and yes it’s so ok and healthy to share what you have been going through. Continuing to pray for you both and totally enjoy your new room! ❤️
My big dog also demolished his cone in 2 days. But never messed with his stitches. Good boy.👍🏼❤️🐕
Oso 🐻 on the couch was hilarious! 🤣
Cancer is so shitty. There’s no nice ways to put it. It fucking sucks. Hold each other, take it day by day and if that’s too much just minute by minute….your beautiful people, your going through hell…do it together and do it with love ❤️
glad to see this video come up! been wondering how you've been and what-all you've been up to.
💕👏👏💕
You are my sunday morning pancakes....yay ...
I loved to see u guys 🤍 what a nice family u are 💕 💖
Amazing!!!!
All the Love & Support from India Guys 🇮🇳🇮🇳
So nice to see you both still going strong and your love supporting one another. I haven’t been able to watch any of your videos related to your cancer journey before now and I feel bad about that, but it has made me realize I need to deal with some trauma from my own cancer journey. Keep up the good work, and amazing positive attitude. You are so loved, both of you ❤️
Thank you for continuing to share your lives with us for so many years and keeping us updated.  Without knowing you guys is as if I did and it's nice to see you guys moving and smiles.  I know how hard this journey is from personal experience but I'm sending all my love and prayers that it will all end well and healing is just taking place.  Love you guys 🤍❤️
you got everyones support but maybe you need to put the camera away for awhile and take care of yourself.
Eamon Top Boy. Bec Beautiful as always ❤️
Soooooo good to see you both.  I think of you often.  Hugs
You don’t owe us anything. Thank you for sharing. I find it helpful to focus on the little good things and be kind to myself when I have a weak moment. Lots of love to all of you - including your family.♥️♥️
I have been missing your videos. Bec I have been praying for you both. Eamon you are such a good supportive partner to Bec.
You can do it Emmon!!!!
First, I love you guys! Bec, you're doing FANTASTIC, keep that strong and bubbly attitude. Eamon, that part where you just sat and talked made me cry. Your love for Bec is just so sweet and strong. And finally, that room is just to die for!!! Congratulations!
I love you guys.
I'm helping my parents while my dad is struggling through cancer treatment. It is so hard to watch someone you love struggle both physically and mentally. My dad has always been the hardest working, most active, independent person I've ever known, even as he's gotten old. Seeing him have days now when he struggles just to get out of bed is heartbreaking & it's trying to crush him mentally, as well. So I have a pretty good understanding what you are going through, Eamon. You seem to be handling it really well & Bec is so lucky to have such amazing support from you & the rest of your family. Just make sure you don't forget that you are suffering from cancer, too. You may not be sick, but watching and helping somebody you love fight for their life is ripping through your life as well, so don't forget to take care of yourself. On a side note, I absolutely love your big goofy dog! I could probably watch an entire video of just him. 😋 The sofa removal had to be the best thing I've seen in a long time! Give him a good boy treat from me for the great laugh this morning!!🐾🐾 God bless you guys & I'll keep on praying. 💕💕💕
Fabulous Job, Eamon! So glad you had a job to focus on while Bec rests and heals! It’s so important you take care of yourself, too!  Bec, continued prayers, you are such a beautiful soul!
Bec you just keep rockin' it if I could give you all my t- cells and basophils I would add them to the army for your fight
This room is AMAZING !  It’s actually as amazing as the 2 of you ‼️🥳 😍 You can both be sooo proud of everything you be going through and everything you’ve done !  😘😍💖
Eamon you don’t owe us anything bud 💕
Stay strong My pop got diagnosed with Cancer and my family just has to keep busy feel better❤
Wow my dog literally just had the same treatment and was the same with his cone 😂💙
So happy to see you all.  Thank you for sharing your lives and personal feelings with us.  My heartfelt thoughts and good vibes are sent everyday to you.  Much love, Deb
You guys are just SO SO INSPIRING!!! Love ya and keeping you both lifted in prayer!!
God bless you!  I think you are being very brave and you are doing a wonderful job helping Beca to stay so positive.  You both are in my prayers!
I'm liking this video before I even watch it.  So great to see you all back at it!
So happy to see your shining faces again! I've been looking every Sunday for an upload as I miss your videos! Looks like you are both doing well and can't wait for more videos from you guys!
Good for you to be honest about what you are feeling and how you are dealing with it bud keep your head up and keep being an awesome person.
You both are so amazing... the two of you together can accomplish anything !!  So happy to see your video to let us know your OK
did u decide to adopt Oso??? i hope u did....he’s already ur family❤️
I love your head like that back it's very becoming and I love your smile have a blessed week ahead baby girl
❤
I’ve missed you both!!  Eamon you know we’re here for you too ❤️ Your space looks amazing!  Be well xoxo
I'm an I know exactly how you feel because I had to take care of my mom she daughter colon cancer about 16 years ago the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life so I'm sending so many hugs and so many prayers to you buddy just hang on she'll be over it soon.  Love Susan
Continuing to send positive thoughts and virtual hugs your way. Excellent work on the porch and excellent video, AND amazing section about removing the couch. I haven't laughed that hard at a YT video ever!!! You have a star there.
Awesome job on the gym Eamon! Bec, you're doing an awesome job on getting better! I'll keep praying for your smooth recovery.
Stay positive you are good people, real nice good people who will get through this. Even with everything you still put out awesome vlogs, bec is just pure strength and inspiration personified.All the love from Great Britain .
Last night I was thinking  about the both of you and then here you are! The dog couch episode was somewhat hilarious. Funny that he wouldn't let it go, even until the end, but for that reason, I felt bad for him losing his couch.😥 Your room turned out beautifully and Bec, you look and seem as though you are managing well, radiant. Eamon, your videos are great! Thanks for sharing your journey. ❤
Love u both
💖💯👍
So great to see your beautiful faces today! 💕❤️
We love we two and are praying for you both. Bec you so beautiful .. I have to admit it’s been really hard watching but your strength gives me strength. ❤️❤️❤️
What a beautiful house you've made! Also, you guys are so lucky to have such a great, helpful and supportive family
There’s nothing more manly than a man sharing his feelings! Lots of love!
Great to see both of you moving forward with grace and positivity.  Cancer sucks and can be a drain on every aspect of life, but you two are showing that it doesn't have to define every aspect of life.  Best wishes to you all (including extended family).
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You both have so much love & prayers being  sent your way. ❤🙏
Thank you *so* much for this update! I needed to know how you're doing. The room looks absolutely fantastic! Thank you for sharing your feelings/being so beautifully vulnerable. You two are handling this personal hardship like the most amazing champions that you are. You two are such an inspiration. I'm *so* proud of you both.
So glad to see you both back on YouTube this week.  Leave it up to Eamon and Bec to have a hilarious dog.
Man, if you were jonesin' for some Eamon antics, this is the vlog. The Oso cuts were hilarious, too. From my experience, connections go deep now. I let myself feel it all. What else can you do? I know now that none of it is wrong. So nice now to see all the family show up. That's a lot of love. That's everything. So glad to see you. All this work is such an honor in these trying times. Thank you.
hahahahhahaha osoooo
Stay vulnerable, Eamon — that’s the place from which your font of curiosity and creativity flows to feed your fortitude and resilience in facing and overcoming this and other challenges and adversities. You always exude a joy that no darkness can overshadow because vulnerability makes you porous and yielding, not brittle. Vulnerability is the secret sauce for making us strong in our broken places.
You are amazing!!! 💜
Looks amazing - you're going to enjoy spending time in this lovely new room!! It's wonderful to see the love and support you give each other through this very trying time. And it's clear to see how it affects each of you in different ways, both just as painful. But you are growing and working through it together. It's very special to see your journey, so thank you for sharing and being so vulnerable. Prayers to you both!💕
It’s so rare to see the love and inspiration for each other in good times and bad.  It’s a whole other level of love and sacrifices to come out on the other side we are all praying for the two of you you’ll get there I can see the courage and the bravery  so wonderful.
You're the Man!  Eamon 💞  awesome job.   Hang in there.  This too shall pass and Bec will  be right there with you to share the special love & joy you guys have  And on to continue that beautiful journey of Life!✨ Eamon & Bec Rock! 👊
eamre  stay strong and make sure you take good care of your lovely lady  and bec we can see you are staying positive and we will keep praying for your quick recovery stat strong and god bless
Sending love, light and healing for both of you. Love your fur baby and his antics. How you have transformed that room is amazing, actually your whole place is fantastic. Stay strong and positive. Love you guys 💕
Oso is definitely the star of the show haha. Also, I am a Veterinary Technician who works at a vet clinic, we always suggest keeping the cone on for like 5 days and really only when you're not actively watching him. My thoughts and prayers are with you guys in this process whether it's Bec's health or renovating the house, thanks for doing what you do!
Wish you better, sweet and calmer life. It's normal to feel fown sometimes. Make sur you find  healthy moment to recharge. Kisses
sending you both love x
Take care n be strong,  need more energy to fight for it ... !!!
could you tell us the origin story of osso?? and how you came to have him?
The caregiver needs support too!  Take time for your mental health Eamon. The very best to both of you!
Fabulous transformation! Thanks that WAS fun!  If Oso comes up missing, I think you will know where to find him & he will be laying on his couch😁 Love you guys 😘 Ps- can’t wait till you release some more See you on Sunday gear!
❤ for a 35 min video! ❤ to Eamon for being an awesome supporter of all living things! ❤ to Bec for continuing to show grace and beauty through some tough shit! ❤ for all your family and friends who've shown up!
go bec! and i love how you just let the dog be involved in everything even though he is being chaotic lol... oh and my boyfriend does spray foaming for a living so i found this very interesting for that reason as well
Oso is great comic relief 😊❤️
you guys are such an inspiration :))
Feed her chicken and give her 6 months with me in Jamaica. That’s if she’s part of the protection for the collection for the reception for the correction club 😐. If not then I’m out
Oso is a keeper
So amazing that you opened up Eamon - not easy to be vulnerable - you’re an absolute legend! Sending love and light to you both and Oso💙 ☀️🌻
Great video...but Oso is the cutest,  he didn't take no for an answer, what is mine is mine and what is yours is mine!!  🐕🥰
Sending love to you both.Beautiful people inside and out  xx
PRAYERS GOING OUT FOR YOU BOTH.YES KEEPING BUSY HELPS GET YOU THRU!LOVE YA!
Curious, what temperature are the parts of the house and the new room. Do they have temperature sensors in the rooms?
Sorry to ask and I don't assume I will get a response but if bec is up to it she should make her own channel about her journey and like some things she likes to do. Anyways I love your channel and I'm sending love your way all the time❤
I love how much you guys put Bear into the video I couldn’t stop laughing, love the results!
Osos is so smart ! You are not going to take my couch 🛋 I love 💕
Sending hugs and prayers !
For Bec ❤️
I was so excited to see your faces this morning.. and very smiley 😃. Happy Sunday to you both
Great Job ! Bec you look amazing and you glow ! So many prayers for you two for defeat of this ailment and healing !
Eamon, stay strong and keep doing what you're doing! Your love for Bec is absolutely amazing!  Bec, you're such a strong woman and you are putting in a good fight! Keep fighting and you look beautiful!  You guys have really helped me out of some dark times and I always look forward to your updates.
Let me share some big dog/injury tip: find yourself a cattle farmer, and see if he has the calf cone, which is both bigger and sturdier (unsure if this is a norwegian thing, but it really is a game changer) and then pool noodle the outer edge and tape the heck out of it😂 its the snagging on stuff that makes it break so make that dog a bubble dog! Also if you want to skip the cone all together, some farmers have what we call the blue stuff, very technical i know🤪, which is usually used on udders and stuff for faster heal, my dog hated the taste of it so we could apply it once a day and he wouldnt lick on stitches etc😅 good luck, and continued love from a long time follower in Norway🇳🇴♥️
Bec you’re glowing inside & out. Both of you are amazing ❤
Im so glad you guys adopted Oso. I can tell hes helping, especially Eamon. Thats awesome 💜💙💚✌
❤️❤️❤️
I love you guys so much, keep moving forward. You are an inspiration fot young couples. Thank you!

Eamon, as difficult and hard as it is on the person suffering through this disease, it is just as difficult and hard for their SO as they are not only physically helping but emotionally and mentally supporting their loved one, but also frustrated, scared and angry at not being able to make them well or remove their nasuea and pain or to make them whole. You are doing an incredible job❤❤❤. Bec, our beautiful warrior, your beautific smile, passion and grace is truly inspiring. Our love and prayers are always with you both. It was wonderful to see you up and about.❤❤❤❤ You and Eamon are two beautiful souls, love you both💗💕💗💕💗👍🙏
I’m a bit curious, is oso up for adoption or did ya officially adopt him?
Have missed you both. Eamon I know your pain my husband went through colon cancer, it's hard to watch some times because you want to do something put most days you can only be there for them💗 Sending hugs and Love your guys way💗 and a lot of prayers🙏🙏
Osso is a beast 🤣🤣
Keeping you both in my prayers 🙏 🙏. Sending love from NJ (USA). Stay positive.
Bec, you look awesome without hair. You are such a beautiful woman it is incredible.  You rock girl☆▪︎▪︎
💗💖💓🙏💫
How many women do you know who have died of breast cancer!?!?!?!?!?!? How many people do you know have Treatements that are worse than the problem?  Its insane that she is paying hospitals to kill her. How may women have died from breast cancer? Why are women being targeted?

That was beautiful! Your porch gym looks great! Your family is so amazingly supportive. Your dog is so funny! Love you all!
I was so happy to see you both and your video today, it was a joy to watch. All that you have done to make this cabin into a beautiful home and the work out room looks amazing. Bless you both.
That is the cutest thing I've seen when the dog kept jumping on the couch.  It seems like he knows the couch is his and he doesn't want it to leave.
Looks Amazing!  Well done!  💕💕💕
Eamon and Bec you both are an inspiration to everyone. Love how the porch turned out and love the mini loft. Glad to see all the friends and family helping too. Continuing to pray for you both and sending lots of love and hugs.

Osso and the couch 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️ You & Bec n fam have really made an amazing home. 🏠  YO! I got the Athletic Greens & it does give me energy which I had none before.  THANK YOU!  That damn cone. 😂😂😂  I LOVE Osso! So happy Bec made an appearance.  Good to see her beautiful smile.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️  It was good to hear your side because we often don't think about what the partner is going through also. Look forward to hear Bec's feelings in the update. So happy she has good days during this time. Glad you 2 have each other.  Great role models for the world.  The porch is wonderful.  Great work.
Yay guys. Keep up the great work. And rest when U should.  Bec love Ur work, can't wait to see Ur color designs on line as wall paper or pillow covers...  Em love the partnership energy. Getting stuff done and support of the lady. Also Reno's🙌🙌 Xxx
Love you guys, Eamon and Bec… but Adam is hot!  That’s who I had my eyes on this video.  😀

Great Reno.. & beautiful Dog....appreciate you both for sharing your life journey....
Thanks for the latest video. If I don't get my Sunday with Eamon & Bec my whole week is off. Good to see you feeling better, Bec!
24:24 so cute
The entire WORLD truly LOVES YOU and BEC SO SO Much !! Our thoughts and prayers are with you guys always !!
Nice job on the porch Eamon. Love to you and Bec from Dublin Ireland ❤️🇮🇪
So lovely to watch! Oso is the best xx ! thank you  for  being so real! Hugs of straight xx
So good to see you all looking happy and healthy! Much love as always!!!
Peace Love to you both🥰🌸💪🏻💃🏻✌️✌️❤️❤️💫✨🌄🌄Gaaaorgous✨
You could put some large hooks on the weight wall to hook up any longer resistance bands.
The JOY when I saw a fresh upload from you guys!! Nice job on the porch Eamon, it looks amazing! Big love and strength hugs to you both and a boop for Oso. ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️🌼🌼🌼🌼
Love you guys! Sending more prayers!  🙏🙏
That amazing dog is a gift !! He will keep you both laughing and loving . I’m so glad you adopted him. He deserves you two and you two deserve him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Eamon you’re doing great. Also loft idea, an Oso bucket to get him into the loft.
Bec should check out TrialJectory
Sending you lots of to both of you
🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️
I love how Oso just fits perfectly with you guys and is a sweet and happy addition to the family❤️
💕💕💕
How can you take that couch  from oso ?
Next time if you get caught short on the cone of shame, a bath towel rolled like a sausage and tapped around the dogs neck will be comfortable for the dog, washable and less shameful lol
Thanks for the update guys and well done on the gym/entrance transformation. Sooo good. Also good to see Bec getting through chemo so far and just as important that you Eamon are finding ways to deal with the impact on you too. Rooting for you both to come out the other side soon. Be well ❤️‍🩹
So many virtual hugs to you both!! Sending all my thoughts of love to you both to have the strength to move through this rough time..
❤️❤️
once bec finishes her chemo i would start using rso to heal the body and wild apan mushroom tincture to repair dna..seriously,ive known people with stage 4 who are fully recovered after being given no hope..dont worry about them being toxic because rso and wild apan are superfoods..thc and wild apan combined will be a massive contribution..medical grade cbd has also seen good results..most people i know actually use rso inbetween chemo sessions.
You are both LEGENDS,BEST WISHES FROM IRELAND
So worth the wait! Funny how two complete strangers have filled my thoughts each Sunday waiting for any update. Thank you so much for still keeping us connected through this difficult time. Loving vibes and positive prayers for you both! Stay strong guys...you have SO got this!
Sending endless hugs and prayers and love to both of you❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great work. Get well soon and look after yourselves
Looks like a great idea. As a nurse my only concern fir Becs is if you have any black mold from moisture. Aerosolizing isn’t good for Becs being immunocompromised. It’s a fungus. Can cause a deadly infection for her. (FYI) not trying to be a downer. My daughter is compromised and caught it. Fortunately recovered. Becs reminds me of her lovely persona. The room is the bomb. No mold there even better. Eamon you don’t “owe” us anything. We appreciate you sharing. Find a friend, counselor to confide in. I love both of you, care about your health too. Love love.
Wow such a strong and beautiful couple! Beautiful yoga room love the vibes. Sending you both lots of love health and happiness your way!
Hard to put into words ….you are both amazing and inspiring!!   Hugs and prayers every day for you both !
Love you guys 🧡🧡🧡
Oboist oh so awesome!
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Thank you for sharing a part of your life with us even though you are making your way through such a terribly hard journey. Your positivity is an inspiration and I'm so happy your family is there is provide support and love.
That turned out so amazing! I love how light and airy it is, just like the rest of the cabin. It really feels like an extension of the main space and not like an afterthought "bonus" room that so many other homes have.
So super wonderful to see you two this morning!! ❤  Oso is so much fun!! I laughed so hard at him trying everything to keep his couch!! My prayers keep going out to you!! Remain strong positive and stay busy...it really does help. ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🐕🐕🐕
First off, I’m in love with Oso! 🥰 He is so awesome! Second, the room! OMG it is spectacular! I can see that is going to be a very popular spot in your home. It’s so bright and welcoming! Eamon you have done a great job! (And all the peeps that helped) I can’t forget Tim! Where have you been? We’ve missed you! And lastly,and most important, Bec you look great! It was so great to see you up and about and happy! Thanks so much for sharing and I’ll hopefully see you next Sunday!
Love you both continuing to pray for strength for you both 🙏 ❤️
Hey bro be strong, I am going through the same thing and I can tell you it is not easy but my wife is also helping me out.She will be fine. 👌👌👌
I continue to pray 🙏🏾 for you both.
Oso and the couch...hilarious! Dogs and laughter are both so healing. Glad you have both in your life Bec, and you too Eamon!!!!
Missed you guys!! So happy to see a vlog up today, Oso and the couch and the pivot 😂👌🏼
Chemo is death by radiation! STOP IT!
🌱🌼💚🌼💚🌼🌱
Damn that weight rack is sexy!
Love u guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice to see you guys back and better than ever… ❤️❤️❤️
Eamon, As Bec said, the room looks amazing.  I'm impressed with how much your carpentry skills have improved.  God Bless. I will continue praying for both of you.  BTW, The building inspector will probably tell you the loft railings are spaced too far apart.  US code says no more than a 4-inch (10.16 cm) gap so small children can't get their head stuck between them.  I suspect Canadian code is the same.
Yes we are just as worried about you eamon we love u
You guys have an amazing view!
Best video to watch!! Love your humor, Eamon! This dog haha really a fun personality he has! I admire your strength and supporting for Bec. Love seeing Bec’s smile and being there almost to finish with her chemotherapy! Bec is lucky that she has lots of love and supportive by us viewers, her family and family in law, Oso and Eamon! Thinking and praying to you both! Beautiful transformation on the porch and love it!!
Why didn't you put insulation in the walls and up the rafters?
Eamon you are awesome  very supportive love to you and becs from someone who’s been through the big C twice you are doing everything you can keep up the positive you  and also if your having a down day it’s ok your human remember love to you both from New Zealand 😘😘😘😘😘💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕💪💪💪💪💪
Two things:  Eamon… thanks for keeping it real.  And two:  The dog on the sofa is so freaking funny.  Good name for a childrens book!
Eamon and Bec are jewels.  Keep smiling you guess.
🇿🇦♥️♥️
Yayyyy… te ves radiante y hermosa Bec, les mando muchas bendiciones llenas de Luz, Amor y Paz, Maravillosos Seres, Bendita su Luz, Gracias Gracias Gracias por Ser y Estar los amo 💫⚡️✨Om🙏🏻❤️‍🔥♾☀️☮️💫⚡️✨🥰👶🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
STOP DOING CHEMO! You are killing her! Death by radiation. Let it alone. Fucke the science. You are destroying a life.
Love the new room. Your dog bear is hilarious. Sending you guys my best vibes !!
sending Denman island love to you guys
De kamer is mooi geworden
Missed you!!!!
My Heart wants to hold and Hug you both, GOD LOVE YOU BOTH AND HOLD STRONG.
I was having a really hard day and watching Oso jump on that couch made me smile so big. Thanks for sharing
Hi eamon and bec  brilliant video and hope you are ok  stay safe and well
Love you guys. Eamon your strength is amazing in this and exactly what Bec needs right now. If Bec was getting electrocuted and you held her hand…the electricity would be dispersed and divided evenly between both of you.  That’s more important than anything. (I don’t actually know scientifically if that’s how electricity works but you get the idea) Anyway…everyone get better because i said so. 🤷‍♂️ and get that poor dog his couch back!!! 😠😭  Also get better because i feel guilty ogling Bec knowing she’s not feeling good. ☹️ 😉
Stay strong Eamon for Bec ! Speedy recovery To Bec love those coloring mandalas
Love and blessing form India🙌  U both r stronger together 💖💖 Love u gays 💜 keep up the good work 💜
Hiii guys!!! I'm so happy to see all of your beautiful smiling faces! This video truly made my Sunday. I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for sharing a glimpse into your lives and projects. The porch turned out BEAUTIFULLY. Oso has 100% stolen the show. He's such a good boy and the perfect addition to your family. I'm loving seeing all the friendly faces of your support crew. Every single one of you are champs! I wish you nothing but the best. I think of both of you quite often. Congrats on passing the halfway point Bec!!! You've got this girl! Eamon, you're a remarkable partner. While your journey continues, know that many of us will be wishing you guys nothing but positive days, good happy vibes and endless love! <3
GREAT video, missed you guys.... Oso was hilarious trying to save his couch!  Room turned out amazing.
Eamon - you're the best! The room looks amazing! So happy to see Bec! She looks adorable. Can't wait for her update video!
Are you going to add a window in the loft? 😊
Hearts, love, good thoughts, prayers and STRENGTH sent your way! No matter what goes on - you guys make it through - together.
Missed you guys!!!!
Thank you Eamon for coming on here and being vulnerable during a time so challenging for you guys. And Bec I’m so happy to see you and your energy is just so contagious in the most peaceful way. Always keeping you guys in my thoughts ❤️
Dat blote hoofd staat héél goed ,groetjes Marjolein
Beautiful!!! Great great great!!  Much love to you!
So great to see your beautiful faces…. Misses you both. Love the reno, great job. I smiled, giggled and cried. Sending you all healing vibes. Stay strong!
So glad to see you been praying for you. It probably doesn't seem like much but the Lord can make a miracle out of bad times. Keep going strong with each other! You guys should be so proud of yourself beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful.! Love what you've done very talented and if I didn't mention so happy to see you 🙏🙌💕💯
My 2 year old noticed Bec and said: Mum, the woman has no hair... She is BEAUTIFUL ❤ (and he is absolutely right!) Lots of LOVE to you guys from Germany
Sending love and prayers to you both. ❤️🙏🏻❤️ I almost peed myself watching your dog jumping on the couch while you guys were trying to get it out of the house. Omg soooooo funny. Blessings. 😘
Bec has got a wonderful man there you have been doing a great job looking after your loved one I would like to say you are in a beautiful place there great for Bec prayers are with you Bec take in that fresh air and that stunning view you both have wonderful family around you  Looks absolutely lovely well done All my love Juliet 🤗🇬🇧

Love  and hugs from Sweden ❤️
Amazing job it looks great your attitude is amazing you guys are so good together and it's nice to see she's getting stronger and stronger each day keep it up
So great to see you both as I was worried. You don’t realize how much you have enjoyed this family until they don’t vlog as often. Eamon and Bec are so genuine you can’t help but feel a lot of love for them, perfect strangers on the one hand but feels like family nonetheless. God bless you both and please continue looking forward to better days as they surely are going to happen. ❤️❤️
Beautiful to see your family come together to do projects at this time. Bec gets cancer and luckily has perfect skin and the optimal head shape- still looks gorgeous.
Het doet me goed naar jullie te kijken. Fijn dat jullie nog steeds van elkaar houden. Het leven is niet altijd makkelijk. Maar jullie doen het goed. Ga zo door
Great to see you Bec, you're looking fantastic. Great progress for both of you. Love from Thailand
Love you guys
You are both amazing people it's hard with Bec having cancer but you Eamom are going through it to you have to stay strong and hold Bec together and still get on with every day life and any projects you want  to do .It was so lovely to see Bec doing so well it must a real struggle for you both.I rreally your regular weekly vlogs. Stay strong Bec we're all praying for you and can't wait for you to be well again xx
Great video, thank you 🙏
Love you and your tribe 💛 ❤
I know this may seem really weird, but as a Friends fan, I fully appreciated the "pivot" moment :)
Very nice. Well done!
You both are amazing!
❤ I'm thinking of you guys. Positive thoughts, and you both are such beautiful people 💖
Thank you for sharing your story with us. I keep you in my prayers. Stay focussed and know you are loved. You both are doing great. Lots of love from SA
Yay!!! Woweee looks fab d dab! Sending love✨ 🍁 ❤️ 🇨🇦
You are Amazing Eamon! You are allowed to have bad days! You are her rock! Shes a very lucky girl!!
Another great vlog, you are such beautiful people.  Take care and keep safe. Xxx
You both are so truly amazing! I can imagine this would be some of the hardest times in your lives, but you two are you strong and lucky to have each other for all the love and support <3
It looks beautiful!  I'd love to do yoga in that room.  Thinking of you guys and sending love!
You guys are beautiful Peep's sending luv 💞💕💞💕 I look forward to Sundays cuz I can't wait for your videos keep on keeping on much love
Thank you for that awesome shot of Oso eating! Very creative!
Eamon, please let yourself do recreational things sometimes.  It’s not selfish to take a little “you” time. If you push yourself too hard, you’ll be no good to Bec, and your friends and family will have two people to worry about.  I have been the patient a time or two, and I have also been the primary caregiver of family members going through major health things. In some ways it’s harder to be the caregiver, at least in my experience. I’m glad to see that Bec is doing a good job of paying attention and not pushing past her limits—letting herself color or do something restful when she needs to.  It’s actually harder as a caregiver to recognize when you need to let down for a bit, and it’s way too easy to feel guilty when you do.  You’re under a terrific amount of stress.  And yes, keeping busy can help—but it can also be another way to overdo.  Just listen to what’s going on inside you—when you start feeling tired or foggy or emotionally stressed, take a step back and do something that is restful and fun.  Someone once told me it’s like when you’re on an airplane and they tell parents to put the masks on themselves before they help the kids.  You have to be able to breathe in order to help others.  So breathe, please.  You’re both in my thoughts and prayers. Thanks for keeping us posted, and I’m sorry you’re going through hard times. Brighter days coming for both of you.
The porch transformation is stunning!! I love the entry way/weight setup. Spectacular vision and execution!
This is amazing! U should make a housetour sometime, it would be amazing to see it all togheter
❤️🇨🇦
Your  both are so wonderful.  Your in my thoughts and prayers.
You guys got this! Sending all the good energy and vibes your way! <3 Everything is looking beautiful!
Xoxo

Wow!!! It looks amazing! I’m so proud of you both for your courage and strength💜
Eamon … please take heart knowing you are taking care of Bec (and yourself) by doing this project. The gym will help Bec regain her strength and spirit … well done young man ! Sending love and prayers from Michigan ❣️
Man!! It was so good to see our "friends" today!! We miss yall so much!! Much love from Ohio!!
I just started your video and caught a glimpse of the yoga studio, omg what I saw... so beautiful  Group workout and yoga classes! PIVOT
I watch your channel all the time and  just  noticed  I was not subscribed! Fixed it. This episode was like one of those all star cast shows with cameo after cameo. Besides Bec I think Oso stole the show though. He is hilarious! The poor dude lost his balls and his couch in the same episode.
So happy to see you guys beautiful God bless 😘😘🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thx for today episode. Really wanted to see how you and bec are doing. Grateful to see that bec is half way through. Love and blessing of the divines greatest outcome.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi Tim❤❤ wow the room looks great. LOVE LOVE LOVE to Bec, you are a rock star Gurl❤️
Wow what a beautiful space you and your friends and family have created.  Best Sunday I’ve had in a while 🥰
Love seeing the families come out in force to help you guys! Family is so important to have around, not just for you, but it helps them as well. So glad you took the time Eamon to share your thoughts and feelings! Seeing Bec rally at the end of the video allows us to see our prays and support are working and helping her! The porch looking amazing. KEEP THE DOG!! His energy brings such a healing vibe to you both!!
Amazing! You guys are moving mountains both of you! Loved watching this video! Lots of love <3
So good to see you all!! I love the new loft! I love Bear! And Bec you’re beautiful! Sending good vibes from Michigan! #fuckcancer
So good to see you guys again!
I was so excited to see that you had uploaded a new vlog.  I think your both doing so well. Love to you all x
Aww and Bec (now that I've finally banged watched every single episode in just 2 months) I absolutely love how you tear up so often. You're so genuine and beautiful. Thanks for sharing your beautiful smile on the vlog.
Bless you both - I have cancer now so I know how you feel- Eamon you have more strength than you think and Bec it will be over….. have faith and believe!!! Love you guys
Wow!! This was a Great video!! I am so impressed with what you have done in --- and how well you are handling --- such a difficult situation. You and your team are amazing!! Sending ❤️ to you both!!!
Much love to you both❤️
I have to keep pausing to make more comments as I watch. Just getting to the end of the video and wow it looks amazing!!!!  Bec ending the video brought tears to my eyes.  Love to you both and to Oso from Southern California 💕
Was so happy to see this today. Continued love & prayers to you both 💕
YAY! The new patio/gym space looks amazing!!! Love you guys so much!
What a awesome transformation!!! Everything looks like it was all ment to be there!!  Keep pushing and working hard one day at a time guys!!! Sending all my love and positive vibes!! ♥️❤️♥️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰
Loved this project video.  Lots of love and energy to you guys 🤗
We love you guys! Thanks for sharing Eamon! I know it wasn't easy but it's opposite of what we have been told to do our whole lives as men but this is also why the suicide rate in men is so high!
nice work! i’m now back after a break from your videos (a bit to triggering for me) but i loved this one!
Love you guys 😍😘
Loved this video so much, sending you so much support and love and also your dog wanting to get on the couch as you were taking it out literally had me crying tears of laughter. I LOVED all of his cameos. So good!
Hang on in there guys,like you said try and stay busy, sending u lots of love from Madrid Spain mucha suerte.
Love the drone footage of the lake in winter. It made me think what  wonderful place to heal. Thinking of you both and sending healing thoughts
Bec, girl you're the cutest no hair at the moment Lady I've ever seen. Hate that you have too, but shoot you pull it off! Half way through ❤ so glad, happy you have what was appearing to be better days after your treatments. Coloring channels creativity, peace and relaxation - which will help you move past the bad moments you dont have strength. Love the both of you, and the pup. (Is his name Oso or Bear, are there two dogs - sometimes I think it's a diff dog) Great seeing Tim and Bob in the Vid, and Loved that your M&D and Brother came in to help too. Eamons brothers and His Mom's Partner, Gord all make up a wonderful support system...as well as anyone I forget. Love the You Tube Family Community is there for you as well, showing love as best they can from as far away as they may be. Allie's hair donation moved me to some tears and just reminded me of how important friends are, even if you dont see them often. Sending Strength and Love. My Best, Carole
Amazing job Eamon and family. It looks so good. Get well soon Bec, all the love to you both
You just made my day! You’ve been missed! ❤️
Your gym is fabulous!!!!  Well done Eamon and crew!  ((Eamon)) ((Bec))
💜💜💜
Glad to hear you are enjoying the good days and making the most of them.  There will be more.  Hang in there.
Haven't stopped thinking of you Bec. My daughters teacher was diagnosed around the same time as you and started chemo around the same time too. Tough watching someone so amazing go through something so life altering. Praying for you both
Porch looks great! Great job Eamon and helpers 😊 So good to see you Bec 💕 I am keeping you both in my thoughts and prayers 💕
Watching Oso hang on to the couch made my entire year so far!  I pray for both of you and your families every single day and ask God to wrap you in his arms.  You are an amazing couple and it is such a privilege to be able to be a part of your journeys these past years.
Great video guys!! Eamon express your feelings more, I know this is tough on you the way that is tough on Bec. This is only a very temporary bump in the road this season trust me you guys are about to be at the end of it I send you both so much love and well wishes, Bec girl continue to whoop cancers ass it will not win what its ass of course you will the both of you got this this is only temporary❤️❤️❤️
You two are absolute rockstars!!! 🙌🏼 (Oso too 😉)  Sending good vibes and positive and healing energy, as well as a shitload of love from a fellow Canadian 🇨🇦💛
Pray for you both and love you both. God bless. 🙇‍♀️❤
Hey Eamon , I took off that cone off my GS and it healed just fine !

You are both amazing and such inspirations , much love to you both , health & happiness ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bec is an inspiration❣️ I’ve been where she is and I too had/have an, AMAZING husband to support and love me. Prayers for you both. LOVE the porch!!!!
💗💗Sending you both so much love and healing.  Been here with my partner.  You both are so amazing and your pup is a hoot.  (Really he lost his couch and his bells in the same video, poor guy). I'm glad you have him.
Eamon. Hugs. It is tough watching someone you love and care about going through something and really all you can do is be there, but everything is out of your control. Being a control person makes it even more difficult.  Bec, it was great to see you, even though you don't have your usual energy, it was still great to see you. Omg Bear jumping on the sofa had me laughing. Well done on the room reno!  You have great planning and execution skills!!
30 secs in and I just have yo pop a comment in to say bec you are rocking the look xxx and can't wait to see the end result.. missed ye and sending good vibes
You are AMAZING Eamon!!! We are here for you! I gotta say as well. You two have amazing support and family, which is so important at this time. The gym area looks amazing!!!
I am so happy to have an update from you. Prayers continue for a complete recovery for Bec. The emotional healing for both of you is an ongoing journey. Peace🕊Love♥️and Light 🕯as you March on to a victorious future!
I am so glad to see you again!  I have been so worried about Bec.  Please keep us posted on how she is doing.  Love you guys.
💞
Love a good project. So good to see you all. Way to go, Bec, for pushing through. Eamon, it’s beautiful to see you both supporting one another and accessing your village to let them support you. Continued blessings for healing and a whole lotta love.
Great work guys love it!

So happy to see you back here on construction mode, loved that project and the result is bomb 🤩. Osso is a sweetheart and you two are looking good, seeing you well taken care of and helped by all your family members is a bliss. It's the little things that make the biggest impact on the challenge you're on. Beck as usual you are so beautiful, strong & such a sweetheart💕and Eamon, you're strong too, but don't pass on taking care of your mental health, i'm sure you being "you = overactive" is also a great way to cope with emotions and very entertaining for our little soldier Beck, but take care of you too bud. Sending you love, kisses and good vibes from France😘
That poor dog did not want his couch to go. lol. Very good job guys! Praying for you both.
Wow wow WOW!  ❤️ the new renovation!  I think if you all ever get done with YouTube you could go into flipping houses! Great job! Best part is seeing the two of you up and going. I know this is a hard time but I can see the healing coming on both of you. Lots of love and prayers!
So good to see you both in high spirits, you are inspirational 😊
As someone who has been through this treatment I definitely found it easier for me than it was for my loved ones. I knew I was ill but just got on with it, I didn't have to watch someone I loved deteriorate and suffer and feel like I couldn't do anything. Believe me though, just being there is a big something.
so much love to you both❤ I've been in your shoes Eamon....and it is so hard... but there is an end and a good life ahead for you both!  and... a goofy dog is the best medicine!! love Oso❤❤❤ what is his back story? how did he find you?? what a love!
Eamon great job ALL around!💕
Room looks beautiful!  Love it!
well done!
Wow this room looks fantastic!  It really opens up your space even more, letting all the beautiful healing light, filter in!   I've missed seeing you both on the vlogs, I paused  CasaB vlogs to come watch this one.  So happy to see you both doing well and pushing on through this journey you're on.  Also, Oso is the best!  I love seeing him on the vlogs, he brings so much joy to the vlogs and your lives :)  We'll see you soon, much love to you both!
So happy to see you back 🥰 Bec; so good to hear your laugh. Stay strong! Love you guys 😘
It was so wonderful to see you both today. I will continue to pray for inner strength for you both. Sending peace, comfort and ❤️.
Let me stop you right there Bec...maybe you didn't watch the video...but Eamon, while certainly the GC on this project, didn't do it all himself.  LOL  He had professional help from Oso, who is still mad about the couch AND those things you stole from him....ok focus..  haha.  Seriously...wicked cool work on the transformation by ALL! Eamon...if you have a few extra minutes...feel free to fly down to Dallas, bring your tools, and help me transform my place, then get back and make Bec lunch.  K?  LOL Keep on rockin it you three!  Oso in charge....almost.  I swear he was going to take you both down for that couch.  Hilarious...well not to Oso.
Are you able to adjust the volume when power tools are running in footage?
Bec... You're BEAUTIFUL Bald!!!!!!
I just wanted to say thank you❤ I know it's showing up. To work(for us), family, friends...I appreciate the smiles and window you both keep giving us. I know showing up is hard right now and I am extremely appreciative🥰🤗 Love you both♡ YOU GOT THIS BEC!!!❤💪🙌🙏

It was so nice to see your faces.  You are loved.   I could hang out in that beautiful room.  The weight wall is genius!
You are both so lucky to have each other, you're such a strong team. Your family and friends are so sweet too. Lean into that support and try to trust the medical process. Bright days are in store for you!

Good to see you guys I hope everything is going okay with the health situation but it's good to see you guys showing us those brave smiles love you and miss you may God be with you in your spiritual healthy journey
Instead of the 'Cone of Shame' for Oso try a pool noodle. There are also similar products at the pet store.
Hold on. Can we just take a second to realize how good Bec looks in a Beanie!
You guys are truly an inspiration!! Sending all the love, light and blessings  to the both of you!! 🌈🙏🏽💗✨All my love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Surrender and really turning it over to a higher power, is the hardest thing! But when you truly do, there is  peace there! One day at a time, gratitude for all “the things”, faith, having each other- knowing that you are not alone through this battle! You both are amazing! All I can say is one day at a time, the day is coming where you will be able to look back on all of this as the necessary evil that it was, and truly leave it behind! And reach the sunshine on the other side! You are both beautiful souls and you deserve all the happiness !! I pray every day for strength for you both! So much love and so many lofty thoughts headed your way❤️( my dogs were my salvation and yours is a wonder!!😍)
Ramon, beautiful job.  Bec. We are praying for you and I must say you are so beautiful, you got this.  Both my daughter went through this but opted for mastectomy and didn’t require chemo. Both are fine now continue the fight, you got this..
As many others have said: thinking about you all and support you cool cats in whatever you’re up to. Keep rocking it and keep doing the best for yourselves and each other. And extra thoughts because of the sunshine angel gal 💛🌻🌴
Oso is hilarious and the porch (and vlog) turned out great! Of course it is hard to be the patient, but the partner and other support people have a rough time too.   Eamon, sending you love and strength to keep up the energy for Bec.   Bec, sending you love and strength to keep fighting the good fight.
Oso! LOL 😅😆
It's great to see you both. Eamon, you are an amazing artist and visionary. God gave you a little helper and joy in Oso. Praying for Bec's complete healing and emotional and grief (losses) support for the entire family. ❤ Praying heavenly Love and Peace will cover you!😅
We all love both of you! Stay strong Eamon, you're an amazing partner and an amazing support system for Bec. We all got you both through thoughts and prayers 💜
Amazing  work guys ! Great video as always. Thank you for sharing . Hang in there Eamon . Bec so happy to see you, beautiful as always. Much luv!
I suspect an inflatable doughnut or a bodysuit might work better for Oso
Eamon, I just wanted to reach into my phone and hug you, Buddy...You are an amazing Man, Partner and Light. You are As Amazing as it gets. Love how you care.
Great to see your new video!
Caretaking is a hard hard job, the will to  dig deep to find the strength to stay strong and care for your person with love and a smile. Just remember that its ok to take care of you too. Take a break if you need it. I know, we all know, you got guys got this.  Thanks for the update! 💜🧡💜✌

I’m so happy for this update on how Eamon is doing. And to see Bec up and active is so relieving. Thank you for sharing what you feel comfortable sharing with your online community. We are praying for you and can’t wait until Bec is fully healed. Eamon, she is so lucky to have you as her person. Prayers for your strength during this difficult battle.

🌅🧡Love🔥♥️Peace🏵️💛Hope🌞😍Power🤟🤙Love🧡🌅
Eamon you are doing a great job being Becs rock! Keep up the good work & love 💕 y’all got this 💪🏾
Oso is such a smart dog! You better replace that couch with something even better for him or he'll take over the bed - mud and all.  LOL he has no sense of awareness of the space around him tho!
As anyone here tried athletic greens? What does it taste like?   Sending love from Vancouver BC 💓 WOW what a transformation!!
I’m so glad that Bec feeling better and actually she’s looking very good. I’m so happy to see a new video and you guys doing what you love best and the room renovation looks great. Lots of love and positive vibes from fellow cancer patient. Positivity has kept me alive. ❤️🙏
LOVE that updated porch guys, phenomenal work ❤️❤️ Also fantastic to see you both working together & Becs totally sparkling. Love from us x
Love that the dog is such a challenge for Eamon....
🥰
I have watched you guys for about two years now. I cried as Bec told us about her journey. Eamon you are so strong and your giving Bec exactly what she needs. My mom is a breast cancer survivor. The hardest part was watching the strongest woman I know fight to stay alive. Stay strong. Praying for you both. 🥰
Even though I don’t know you guys in real life, you mean the world to me ❤️ I feel so connected to you guys through these Videos and it makes me so happy seeing you guys doing as well as you can be, stay strong sending you all of my love from Montreal 🥰
I have walked many miles in those same shoes Eamon. As guys, we seem to often be hardwired to be "fixers". If something isn't right we fix it, if it's broken, we fix it, if it's just not working, we fix it. And we get used to that role and comfortable with that attitude of being able to control situations by "fixing" something. When my wife and I began OUR cancer journey, one of the hardest things for me was learning to accept that I was indeed powerless to "FIX" anything. It is amazingly hard to look at someone you love suffering something as difficult as chemo and be entirely powerless to make it better. The feelings of not being able to do anything to make it better are terrible to deal with, BUT, learning to accept that I had no control over it but could still be strong and supportive in the face of it was a big step in my personal growth. It's no fun man, but find ways to be who Bec needs you to be. make a special dessert, or find a special hat or warm fuzzy gift. You're creative and resourceful, and THAT can be your current superpower! I know you have the inner strength ! Celebrate the good days, endure the hard days, and remember EVERY day is a VICTORY! Love and prayers to both of you!
Love what you have done with the room! It looks amazing! Your love and support for each other and the motivation for life that you both show is inspiring. Sending love and positivity to you both.
I love the shots of Oso 🐻😂
my heart ❤️ is with you all ! God bless ❤️ prayers ❤️! it's good you have a fur baby! just remember we all love you both ! ❤️
I've been thinking of you both. Hang in there! A better day is on the way!
Oso is amazing lol
Sending so much love to you both.  I am glad you have family to help.  Ask for help when you need it.  Love!!!
So lovely to see you both. Omg Eamon it must be so hard watching someone you love and have no control. Not be able to do anything. Bec your amazing. Keep doing it! Be strong. You will both get through this. Sending love ❤️
Great job on the remodel! Keep going you two, brighter days are ahead for you both!
I hope so, I love it and I love y’all happy Sunday 🤍
Continued prayers, love, and support for you both 🙏❤️
So relieved and happy and grateful to see you two!  We have been so worried and seeing your faces this morning was truly a gift!  The sunroom/exercise porch is beautiful.  Bec, you look good and your positivity is amazing. Eamon, your strength and vulnerability - thank you for being real and open. And we love Oso!  He provides the moments of comic relief and pure love you need. You will get through this together. We are all cheering you on!!  💙💙💙💙
Love you both - 💕❤️
I am happy Bec is better♥️ I am sure you will be great! Lots of love⭐️
Wait I forgot is this y’all’s forever home??
Omg how cute he was so smart he was like oh hell no your not taking my couch 😂
Oso and the couch - classic comedy!
Fantastic job on the multi-function room! That looks so good! And Eamon, know that it's okay to not be in control every now and then. I repeat that to myself every morning and have a hard time believing it myself, but deep down I know it to be true. Be good, be happy, (be sad when you need to,) and be your best self. Love you guys.
I don't know if it's because I've been craving a new video but... whoever is doing your editing is doing a GREAT job. I loved all the special effects - they weren't too much, just enough to create interest.   The two of you are doing magnificently at what you're working on, whether it's construction of your home or Bec's body. You're both an inspiration.
You’ve been in my thoughts…. It was so wonderful to see your beautiful selves this Sunday morning!  The sun Room/entry/gym looks amazing. Great job. I look forward to Bec’s update. I am with you both in ❤️.
I love you both!!! And we don't even know each other. Eamon, thank you for sharing your vulnerability. That made me cry. Maybe you need a coloring book too! Bec is just super strong, super positive and a super woman all around. Love and light from Florida! ❤🌞
The moment Eman opened up about his feelings the tears just started falling.  Stay strong dude. Find support for yourself too! I know that I easier said than done but you are surrounded by so much love and support from both your families!
So much to love about this vlog💕 Oso is so silly and lovable and was definitely brought into your lives at this time for a reason🐶 Prayers to you from Southern California for your returned health Bec 🙏 Love you guys!!!!!!!!  Nose bop to Oso and hugs to you both 🥰
After watching this I went out and took a walk and sent out the most positive energy your way.  Bec it was great to see your beautiful self today and Eamon hang in there you are the absolute best!  Found out I’m going to be a grandma again and I suggested Eamon as my name choice, Amrynn and Eamon sounds good right?!
Eamon thank you for opening up about your struggles too. It's so inspiring to see you two walking this tough road together.  Love and prayers always 💜
I missed you guys! Thank you for posting because I was so worried. Eamon all your feelings are very much normal, there’s nothing easy about dealing with a family member with Cancer. I’ve lost 3 people in my family. 💔 I pray Becca gets better soon. Much prayers sent your way 🙏🏼
Also coming from another Canadian here, Love you both. You both are so inspiring! You Both know what you want and you wont stop till you gets it! love it! Take has long as you need for rest Bec, rest is power. i love colouring, its a really good stress relieving tool and calming for the mine  (so i heard, may not be for everyone tho.😉.).. Eamon keeping your mine busy by doing what you love is awesome..and look what you belt with your time..well spent i say..looks amazing..happy to hear your both doing well.😊..🙏🙏💙💜
I'm so glad to see a pist from you two.  You both have been in my thoughts. You are both extremely strong individuals,  but together you are unstoppable! So happy to see how well Bec is doing.  I love you two!  Stay strong.
Eamon, you're a great partner, and all of us can see how strong you're being. Your emotions, feelings are valid and you have so much love and support, for both of you, from my family to yours💜
I was too scared for 3 years...but I want Bec to know I went for my screening mammo Friday because when she said "Ladies get yourself screened ' it meant something to me...she was helping others even while traveling thru her own bumpy road..and I did it! I don't know my results and it's ok because I feel stronger now. We are not alone on these bumpy roads and we can always help other travelers who are lost, or scared, and just need a big virtual hug., like Bec gave me. Love you both.
You look amazing Bec,  you don't need hair to be beautiful 💕
Eamon you're stronger than you realize, very few as strong as you have been for yourself as you're being strong, loving and caring for Bec. Bec, you're beautiful, strong and amazing too, going through these challenges small and great, is not always easy, life in general is not always easy either, especially with health conditions such as cancer and other kinds of major health conditions. My sincerest heartfelt prayers daily for both of you, for overall healing, recovery and strength y'all need daily to get through it all. Anyway, that's beautiful how you have remodeled that closed in porch to an amazing new look. I like the loft, the loft would be my favorite little area to have some quiet time for sure. Love the way it was all done. Take care be blessed and safe too, sending lots and lots of love hugs and prayers daily to y'all from me in Odessa TX USA (my dad has been put into a nursing home for much needed long term care he really needs, more than I can do because I'm not a nurse. I've done my best I could as his full time caregiver, it was definitely not easy but rewarding at the same time. I'm so thankful to even have had the time to get to know my dad after all the years he had not been in my life. We began with letting go of those things we didn't have in the past and made new memories as father and daughter since 2007 forward to this present day. These last few years hasn't been easy, sadly he has had preexisting health conditions plus dementia that's progressing worse little by little for him and suffering with these health conditions. A month ago he fell hard on his right side of his head on the concrete ramp in front of the VA just shortly after all his doctor's appointment and lab work on our way to leave to go home. The injury caused some bleeding on his brain, no surgery since at this time but under observation still while he's in PT at the nursing home and long term care in the midst.😔🙏📖🕊️💖)
Missed you guys! Talk about a couch potato!….lol
I have never commented on any You tube channel but had to Now BECK you Rock sister, wow you are beautiful!!! Who needs hair lol but most importantly you are an inspiration sooner or later we all have to fight sickness you give hope and love so classy💖

Bec your beautiful even without hair, hang in there.
So happy to see you both. The porch room looks great; you both look great even though these are rough days you are doing it with grace. Much love and healing from Colorado, USA
Hey Eamon, I've been through a similar experience with a loved one having cancer and you are doing an amazing job. Keeping yourself busy is definitely a big help, and you should be proud of yourself for being such a solid rock for Bec. Sending healing vibes to Bec, and giving you guys a huge virtual hug.
Loved seeing a video from you today! It made my weekend! Love the new workout room and so happy to see how you are both doing. You're almost there! BIG HUGS to you both!

Can you rent out the little loft cubbie on AirBnB? I'd sign up in a heartbeat. My love to you both!
My thoughts and prayers are with you and Bec. It's so hard for her to be going through this, but also hard for her loved ones to watch her going through it. To want to be able to take the pain away but can't. I looks like your family has been coming around a lot to give support, that's a blessing.
Lovely to hear from you two again! The room is taking shape! Heaps of love to you both🙏🙏
When I pray to God for a partner he has lots of your qualities Eamon, you guys are blessed with your loving relationship. I love y'all, so happy to see your video. By the way Oso is  the perfect dog for you, he is so funny and sweet. I love him and can't wait to see you traveling in the van with him 😍😍😍😍 Feel better Bec, we are rooting for you. ❤❤
Hi guys, so good seeing your beautiful faces again. Eamon the mud room/yoga studio/gym is amazing, Awesome job! You guys always make it look so easy. My best friend and husband of 30 yrs is also a can do kind of guy.  It's the best thing, being able to transform your home into a love nest. All the blood sweat and laughs pay off in the end. You guys live in paradise and deserve all the blessings this life has to offer. Bec you look amazing and beautiful as ever. Eamon, thank you so much for sharing your feelings with all of us, that is very vulnerable and much appreciated. You are an amazing partner and human being, The love you share with eachother is so pure and beautiful. Oso is pure joy...Love & healing light coming from the Central Coast of California  <3
The place is looking amazing!  I know things are difficult right now. But the way you support each other is wonderful.  When I had cancer my mother said good, my father said it was an excuse not to work and a child said people who can't afford insurance shouldn't live. Everything could be so much worse.   ❤️💜💙🤗
Ps how are you doing with the cancer updates Bec you would reply ?
We as humans all have these trials to go through, how we deal with it defines us, you guys are doing great with HOW, hang in there, I'm praying for you both, best wishes,   Bob
Thank you both for sharing your journey!!! You are both very strong!  You are in my thoughts
Eamon you really make me cry. why?? bc the love you show our Bec is unconditional. Though it’s hard you don’t let it get the best of you. You keep it pushing even when it’s hard. Bec as long as your smiling it blesses my heart. Bec your almost there! we got this!!! 💛
I was so excited to see this vlog and how you are both doing. Prayers  for strength, peace and love during this trying time. Eamon, you have an amazing talent and vision. You kind of remind me of my hubby in his younger years. He’s retired now because he is a survivor of kidney cancer and now getting by with leukemia. Yes #cancersucks. Stay strong. He’s slowly (on good days) like you…keeping busy with our attic so I can relate. I’m a nurse and Unfortunately many who feel defeated at times. Bec, Eamon you are both a pillar of strength. You do give inspiration to so many including us caretakers who need to see your positivity. Oh! And I just loved loved loved the planter and thought that came with it when Bec got her first chemo. I cried from the heart.
Eamon,I wanted to say I know you heard that Taylor Hawkins Pasted a few days ago. Well when i was talking to his wife on Face book I saw that he was a follower of you two. How cool is that,  he was a fan of you two. He and his wife both. She told me how they loved watching you every Sunday. Jus t really cool i thought. I wanted to say, like every one else how proud of you both I am. I catch myself crying when yall tell us whats been going on. Just know that you have so many people praying for you all. And Bec is so strong, that well man I know she is gonna be just fine. I know how hard it is on you to  buddy. Stay strong and this to WILL pass. We all love you both. Big Hugs! I love love love your dog. Love ya Bec!
Such a strong soul you are Eamon. Happy to see Bec being so positive throughout. May you both and your families blessed with all the blessings in this world. Bec you’ll be super fine super soon. I pray!🙌🏻 Lots of love and hugs! 🙂
Beautiful job guys!!!! Sending you both much love and prayers!!!!
Sending you both so much love and support. The clips of Oso refusing to let the couch go made my day!! thank you for that ❤
So glad to hear from y'all, I'm always sending great energy your way. I've been where Eamon is right now, so I know firsthand how hard it can be at times, but my other half kicked cancer's butt, just like Bec will, and she has now been in complete remission for 8-years. I'm sending good thoughts along with many blessings. Y'all got this!
If love coming to you from around the globe has any bearing on your healing time, Bec, I reckon you'll be using that fabulous new gym in no time! Sending a hug.  Actually, two hugs.  Eamon is doing great too. xx
You all did a great job!
Beautiful!   You two are so amazing.  Sending many hugs!
Love you guys!
I have missed you both! I was so happy seeing a new video! Bec continue to take care of yourself, that's your most important task right now. Love and prayers for you both.
This was such a great surprise this morning.  It was so great to see that Bec is managing the Chemo so well and thanks for sharing your feelings Eamon. I have been thinking of both of you and sending my prayers for you both.  I laughed so hard at Osho and the couch. What a fun dog , lol.  Great to see Tim, Bob and all the family that came to help.  That room is so beautiful. Bless you both and Osho!  Super video.
Feel for you both, hearts, lovely love and prayers with you both! Love you both❤️❤️
you guys are truly an inspiration, both as a couple and as individuals! keep pushing strong you guys! rooting for y'all from Singapore!
Love 💕 you guys! Crazy how good it is  Emon to let a higher power take over! And this is exactly what I see happening! When we are out of breath, He is there for us! I have you both and and whole family always in my prayers and heart.
So happy for a new video! Have missed you all! 🥰🥰
So happy to see a new video from you guys! The transformation of that room is inspiring. I’m planning to redo my bedroom soon and it got me excited to start. It’s always a lot more work than you think to renovate anything but the result is almost always worth the time/effort. Love you both❤️
Blessings for Bec.
Morning, it is eamon & bec Love the remodel  Stay strong bec
Ramon, kudos to you for hosting 3/4 of this video solo. You did an awesome job on the room & documenting its progress.  Bec, loved seeing your smiling face. You are a strong woman! Bear, you gave me the biggest laugh of the morning with your couch antics!! 🤣
Do I hear a Capt. Riley?
Such incredible work! The two of you are an inspiration!
A cool suggestion for Bec’s colouring - you could join all the pieces of work together and frame them, put it in your new space to remind you of the strength you guys have when working out/yoga/just having a bit of a bad day!🥰
Sending Love to Bec your kicking it and look great xx. Like i said before Big love to Eamon to!! This horrible illness doesn't just effect the person involved it effects partners loved ones and whole family's. Thanks for the Vlog I know it must be hard but be strong Bec x and Be strong Eamon x. Porch looks amazing and Oso is so cute and clever. Apologies if I spelt his name wrong. xxx
❤️🙏
I laughed so much at Oso, he is a perfect addition to your little fam jam. ❤️ Great job guys, love the renovation and keep up the positive attitude ❤️🙏. Definitely better days are ahead !!
Greetings from Poland :)
bec you look more beautiful then ever. LIVE LOVE AND LAUGH  oso is so funny
Friends, family, and projects, the best distractions ever. Stay strong.
The porch is stunning! Spring will be here soon, and sunnier days ahead! -your neighbor in Michigan
Imagining a mandela mural on one of the walls
You both and Big, sweet Oso continue to be in my prayers. Much love from Los Angeles! ❤️🙏🏻
Oh my gosh Oso needs another couch now! Sending so much love, light and healing to you both! You’re so often on my mind. Eamon and Bec so hoping you both feel deeply and every bit, all the love and support pouring out to you! Awesome your families can help and are so supportive! It looks so amazing, the new workout room!  💝💙💕🐾💙💝❤️💖💗
My heart goes out to you both. Emon and bec you are always in our hearts and prayers. I know this isn't easy for you both. To watch someone you love go through something so difficult is not easy. You are an amazing husband! Bec is so lucky to have you and your so lucky to have bec. 💗
Thinking of you both as you navigate this journey.  We've had our own serious health issues, and have taken things, one day at a time. Thank you both for keeping your YouTube family posted, as it would be totally understandable if you could not.  The room looks fantastic, and isn't it great to have family that are willing & able to help!  Job well done Eamon.  Sending love, strength & prayers. - Coreen  ❤️
I CANNOT believe you took his couch away. Bad Eamon! 💜💜
Oh Eamon bless you for all you do for Bec and for being so strong through this! I can only imagine how hard this is for both of you. It was wonderful to watch another video from you guys. Know that you are both loved from all over the world. Anita. South Africa ❤❤
I love you guys!  You are looking amazing bec!! So strong and inspiring! You’ve got this! Can’t wait for some yoga videos this summer❤️ Eamon you did a fantastic job! While being so supportive of bec during everything. You both inspire so much to live my life with love and light ❤️❤️
Can we just appreciate how Bec still makes everyone laugh and smile! Love you guys! Xx
Love U Guys 🤩
Incredible job , the porch looks amazing....love the mini loft ...
Thanks for sharing, Eamon, though it was hard to do. Yay to you. I think you're amazing. And try to embrace the dark places too. They're like waves. They come and go. Blessings and love to you and Bec. ❣️🌺❣️🌺
Eamon, from someone who just had a brother diagnosed with cancer two weeks ago today. I know those dark places that you go to. I will tell you like I told my brother, it’s okay to not be okay and it’s okay to go to those dark places. Just don’t unpack and live there. Bec, you look AMAZING and that porch 🤩👏🏻👏🏻 GREAT job! Sending my love and my thoughts and positive vibes to you both.
We miss you guys!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
That's fire! Well done Eamon and Bec. 👏
Sending love and guidance to you both! ☀️💫 #PIVOT had me dying 🤣Lots of love from Barrie, On 🇨🇦
You are such a strong couple and I thing your so lucky to have each other x
Like all your followers, I am so relieved to see you two are still alive and doing ok. You are fighting this illness as best you can. To see Bec  after so long is a huge relief! I love Oso, my kind of doggie. Big, stubborn with an excellent sense of humor. He must bring you so much comfort. All family and friends coming in to help is also so heart warming. SO many people loving you and having you in their thoughts too. Sending love to a most beautiful family.
awesome work guys, keep it up and stay positive.
Sending love to y'all from Texas ❤️
You guys don't owe us anything. I've been a fan for sometime and you both are one of the few real and genuine youtubers. You're doing a great job. Hang in there you'll both get through this. All 3 of you are adorable. Love and prayers for you. 🙏
So great to finally see you guys and BEC you are making BALD way more BEAUTIFUL than I do😁😁😁😁 It is so awesome to see you in such great spirits just like you have been forever.
❤️
Porch transformation looks really good, job well done ! Best wishes for Bec :)
Continued healing prayers and lots of positive vibes to you both! 🙏❤🙏❤
I have to tell you I was not a big fan of social media initially, maybe it's my generation ( gosh I can believe I'm saying that😄 ) but I have to say finding and following folks like you two, and your friends, has so changed my  outlook. We may not be friends in the original sense but I truly count you as friends. I think of you often, wonder how and what you're doing. I've been  praying for both of you through this journey. And I miss you when you don't post. It's so good to see you're doing well. Thank you for the update, I've been missing you so. Bec your beautiful I love the coloring, listen to your body. Eamon I luv what you've done to the porch OMG it's beautiful and such a great way for you to keep busy. My heart goes out to you both. Sending you positive thought, love and prayers. YOU'VE GOT THIS!!!! 💋💋💋💋🙏🙏🙏
Wonderful! So…loving the new room! And just amazing to see your smiles. I’m still praying and expecting God to heal you 101%. Big kisses to all three of you. 🐶
Eamon you are one strong person you are being soo strong for bec
Im sooooooo happy to watch your video. Made my day💙
You guys are just the best.. ever!
Hope you both get the happy ending you want.😀
Looks amazing! Big hugs your way
So good to see Becca in there! Love you guys! Keep on keepin' on!!
Dear Eamon, I can totally relate to that losing control feeling. I've been there for the past 3 years with a close family member. What helped me through so far was (actual) therapy in person. Thank you for sharing your side, too, and still keeping up making these incredible videos! Sending hugs both of your way, you guys are so inspiring. <3
Love you guys.
Sending you both BUCKET LOADS of love and healing thoughts.... Eamon keep being you,  sending you both strength x
Can you let us know the best way to support you two when you aren’t able to do as many uploads?  Should we be watching old videos? Commenting on old videos?  Following you on other platforms?
Sorry but your dog is not smart in some ways man
Eamon and Bec it is so heart warming to see the love, support and comfort you give to,one another.  Eamon I was tearing up when you spoke about your feelings!  It is such a pleasure to see how the entire family rallies together, including Oso.🐶. Words will never express the care and love I’m sending your way. I’m an ‘old’ lady who is praying for a swift recovery ❤️‍🩹for Bec.  I’ve had cancer, it can be a nasty beast👿.  You too will be a survivor.  Much love and peace for you both.
LOVE seeing that "life goes on" while in the thick of difficult times. Your new porch looks awesome! Are you changing the windows as well? Eamon you made me cry with your little heart to heart moment. Beck you are grace, strength and beauty personified during your chemo ordeal... sending you both tons of positive energy...  ⚡💛⚡
Prayers for your family  I enjoy your videos
You did a great job with the sunroom. Your looking good Bec. Take care you two. 😊
Desde Puerto Rico pura vibra positiva!!! A los 2!!
What a transformation what a great area for you both.  How you transformed the property has been so awesome to watch you both are very skilled but also the interior design is so unique some of your ideas have been so clever and so glad you have a forever home that you can call home and it’s just perfect especially Bec for your treatment and recovery.  Hope planning signs off your deck and steps and you don’t have to tear it down cannot see the problem with it as it looks amazing.  Thankyou for sharing your journey with us all.  💕🙏
Eamon, you said you are Bec's rock well sending you love and strength from The Rock of Gibraltar xx
Glad to see a new video, Bec has been on my mind and in my prayers.
Love you guys so much.💜💜💜✨ lots of love from barrie💜 also, glad you love the t-shirts from the shop! Xo
Great vid, went by so quick. Wondered what was going to happen to that room, looks good and the small gym area, I'd love. When you looking over his shoulder smiles on both face, can't help but smile. The dog was a laugh, the joy of pets, always up to something. Take care of both each other and yourselves. See you next time 💛
So happy to see y’all back, totally not complaining about your all’s break because it is so needed! So happy to see Emon talk about his feelings and how he is doing, and so happy to see and hear Bec!
What good people you are, sending healing thoughts to you!
Lovely repurposed room!   Glad to see you both, been thinking of you all week.
Oh I forgot to ask do you send your merch to Europe?  If so would be great to be able to access some of the old merch as well as the new stuff... Maybe Eamon and Bec originals...
Beautiful space. Love you two and sending love and healing vibes to you both ❤️
❤️ Thinking of you guys always ❤️
Sending blessings. You are both amazing
Beautiful transformation. Lots of positive vibes to both of you ✨✨
Incredible work🤩 I wish you all the best💕

Love you guys! ❤️🙏🏼🙂
The room looks fantastic.  Love the transformation.  Hope you are both doing well.  Sending some fellow Cannuck love your way.
So lovely to see .and both keep strong x
Legends x
So good to see you both!  Bec, you are amazing, your spirit just shines through!  Eamon, you are one in a million.  Your love for Bec, your drive to complete jobs and your honesty in sharing with us something so personal.  On another note Oso did not want to part with that couch, it was hysterical to watch.  God love you both, please take care and we will see you on the next one.  Oh and the porch/Gym looks incredible, you guys did an amazing job.
Woowwwwww i love it!
Sending all my positive energy and love to both of you! We got this!❤❤❤
Oso needs his own channel! Love his energy. 🐾🐾🐾🐾❣️
Sending you both so much love. ❤️
So good to see you both again. We stand in Confident Expectation
Having been through something similar, Eamon, you're doing great.  You're going to have moments.  Thank you for opening up about how you're feeling.  This is tough.  For both of you.  If it helps, focus on the here and now, and don't dwell on the 'what ifs'.  Your love for Bec (and her love for you) is so obvious and will help you both as you walk this path.  Love both of you and praying for you as you go through this.
You are an amazing boyfriend, this too shall pass and you guys will have it better than ever. Trust your journey, God is by your side.
About 3 hours ago I just looked to see if you gotta had something out, I've been very concerned about you!
❤️
Hi Beautiful people 😊, It is so great to see you continue with your lovely home.  Eamon I was laughing so hard at Bear with the couch sitcho... Oh my goodness what a cool dog.  I love him so much. He definitely fits in your little family.  Thank you for such a great vlog.  Also it's tough to share emotions especially to the viewer I can only imagine.   I have a very close family member who is thankfully cancer free.   Trust me I know what your going thru.  I feel for you and Bec.  Sending you both a warm hug and positive energy.  You did a beautiful job on this build.  Funny you built this half wall as I was just thinking how to built a gym/yoga equipment stand for my place.   Now I have a great idea. Many blessing to you both.  Bec your looking well you both are in my thoughts and prayers.  💖
So much love......... ❤❤ Continued prayers for you both!!!
Wonderful to see this post from you both. A huge relief to see and hear what is up with you! Keep you in my thoughts EVERY DAY. Nice job on the "porch
Sending love and good thoughts all the time.. Pooor Oso... from a big ol couch to a mini trampoline? ;)
STOP WHEN I HEARD SHE WAS HALF WAY DONE WITH KEMO I ALMOST CRIED IM SOOOOO HAPPY THAT SHE IS DOING SO GOOD WE ALL LOVE YOU BEC!!!!!!!🥹
I think your dog came into your life at just the right time and to help you through this. I am sending lots of positive energy your way.
Great to see y’all this Sunday. Hit the like to support and go back and watch some episodes you may have missed to support them.
Eamon - thanks for such honest talk in such tough times for you. At some point in the future you will realise how much you have grown together through this awful experience - right now just take it moment by moment. There IS an end and you WILL get there. Much love and prayers for you both xxx (ps - the porch looks awesome!)
Thanks for sharing of yourself. Sending lots of white light healing and strength.
Yesss! So glad to see you both again!!
I am right with vloggingblonde: Carrying you both in my heart and mind in all ways. This was an amazing episode from start to finish. Oxo and the sofa, the cone, retrieving the ball from the tree. What a guy! Eamon, the entry/workout space/loft (for the kiddos!) is absolutely stunning. Bec, it was so great to see and hear your sweet voice. Eamon, you're a legend and thanks for sharing your journey of going through this together with Bec. Always, always thinking of you all~Cass
Onesies work well for dog who can’t use the cones! Works great
Train the dog.  Not doing so is a disservice to the dog. We see you are trying, but it has to be all the time when starting with an adult dog.  He needs to know the pack order.   Lots of positive energy to you all.
It's so good to see Bec up and about and smiling!
My heart goes out to you,  Eamon..Lots of love and support to you and Bec❣♥️
Thinking of you both all the time 💕
Hang in there and be strong. You guys will make it and saying prayers for you both! LOVE YOU
This was seriously an amazing vlog!!! The clips of Oso were such great comedic relief! I'm so happy he found a forever home with you guys. I think this is one of your best vlogs you've ever published! My fav at least. 💕
Buddy, you owe us nothing. Take care of you and Bec, we are cheering for you both!!
Eamon my heart goes out to you it is often harder on the “other person” but even when times get hard you both manage to stay positive and stick together both of your feelings matter stay strong. Sending love to all of you ❤️❤️❤️
The room looks great, awesome work as always. And Oso is such a funny boy, he stole the show in this video. ❤️❤️❤️
Lots of 🥰 love to both of you  . You guys are amazing 🤩 . Enjoy watching you ☺️ both  .
💟💟
Osso is hilarious
You don't owe us anything Eamon, we are just happy to come along for the ride. Thank you for sharing everything about your lives so Looking forward to seeing Bec ring that bell! . Love from Scarborough ON.
Love you guys 💛💛💛 lots of strength and positive energy your way !!
Half way there guys before you know it.. it will be a memory ❤️ great job on the cabin ❤️
I was dying laughing when Oso wouldn't let ya'll take the couch. xDD That was just precious.   Also kudos on keepin yourself goin there youguys! You got dis! <3  Keep your chin up Eamon! you're awesome~
I heard a rumour that Osso is still looking for his couch!  I’m sending lots of strength and healing vibes your way. There’s some for each one of you.
Good work everyone on the space, really turned out well.

Great video. Thanks for sharing and hang in there. 🥰
I know Eamon how you feel....My wife beat colon cancer but now two years later is suffering Liver cancer and Chemo..I don't have a support system or anyone to vent to....
Awesome room reno.  Bec is a warrior.  Eamon is a hero.  And Oso... well he gave me the best laugh ever with his continued attempts to keep his sofa.  Wonderful video.  I think of y'all often and send lots of prayers your way.
Hi Eamon and Bec I am so glad that you are doing great 👍,  especially Bec,  keep up the great job and the fighting 💖,  Oso needs a new bed or sofa 🛋
Stay strong and Positive, Eamon. I've been praying for both of  you. 🙏 Cancer sucks, big time!! Things will be  better, once her Chemo is done. Your entry way looks great!!
I smiled the whole way through…amazing new space…i think bear needs a sofa! Much better than the Friends version ✨Lovely to see you all again. Take it easy - “second by second, min by min, hour by hour, day by day” …you’re both stars ⭐️⭐️✨🌈✨❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

It’s SO GOOD to see you both!!! I’m a mom.  I worry if you don’t write, call, or vlog. Not stop positive healing vibes are being sent your way.  The porch looks amazing and it was lovely to see the parade of characters chipping in, both humans and furry ball of canine love.
🌻💛✨
I loved all the family & Tim cameos in this video! Remembering back to when you were looking for a cabin, finding this place, and now today, what beautiful vision. You gave new life to this cabin, in the most warm & welcoming way. It oozes positive and healing vibes. Still sending much love your way. ❤ You both are in my thoughts often. xx 🤗
Love you guys, very, very much 💚💚including Oso of course 🐻
Wonderful to see you guy's again. Please Bec use Medical Marijuana with a vaporizer. You'll feel better and eat more. God bless you both.

Sending so you so much love 💞 Roo xx
What a wonderful gift watching a video from a wonderful adventurous couple! Prayers continue. Welcome Spring 🌷🐞🐦
Great job Eamon. Way to keep busy and positive. Remember man, this too shall pass. Peace
Great to se you again. Love the gym the projekt looks amazing. And i will try that making those fore dinner 🍽 😋   All the best wishes to my favourite youtubers ❤️
Incredibly happy to see you again! 😍 Hope you are doing fine (keeping in mind the situation) and never lose hope, I am praying for you! Greetings from Germany and nothing but love for you two wonderful souls😘
Love you guys. Eamon, I am you and you are me. That whole control thing is brutal. I totally felt that. I'm a bit older than you so I can tell you what worked for me. I had to constantly tell myself to tackle ONE THING AT A TIME. That's something you can control.  If all else fails smoke one or chew one. 😁 💚
Thank you for the update and another amazing post!  IT IS SOOOO GOOD seeing you guys happy, busy and doing well!  XXOO❤
I'VE BEEN WONDERING HOW YOU GUYS BEEN. SENDING GREAT VIBES. THANKS FOR SHARING!!
Sending so much love to the both of you! The new room looks amazing and was so cool to see how far it came from the original cabin.
Your strength kept me from crying... it coulda gone either way, there for a minute. I see a good wholesome family with a lot of support. You got this!👍
Love you guy's, keep on,keeping on❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤
I’m so so proud of how far you’ve come in your journey with the house and everything! It is truly a place to call home and to heal. Love seeing both of you being open and taking in all the love and energy we are sending. Keep going both of you! And give Oso all the kisses! The couch thing was amazing!! Hahahahhaha beautiful boy! 🥰 Sending you all the positive vibes and know that I am always thinking of you! Spring is coming and the liquid sunshine is washing all the bad things away and making room for more amazing things to come 🤍🌻
I have been following your journey for a while now and I wanted to just pop in and say how amazing I think you both are. I love that you use your platform to show a more honest version of what life looks like. I also wanted to say that I appreciate Eamon sharing his vulnerability, but I hope you both remember that you owe us nothing and I never want you guys to feel like you aren’t meeting our expectations if you decide not to share things.  We’re grateful to be a part of your journey.
Fabulous reno work and concept. Glad to see an update - you are both in my thoughts. Hope to catch you on the leader board. Spring will be here any day. ☮️ 🙏
*Hey Tim* it's been a minute!
Nice to see you guys
I just wanted to  send you a virtual hug and prayers for you and your family!  Your new sun room looks amazing 😻!!!
So glad you guys are doing well. The reno of the "entrance/exercise room" turned out great!!
To brighter days ahead!! 🙏Good luck guys and dolls!! 💖
Finally, the "SEE U SUNDAY", love you both❣️❣️❣️
I’m happy Bec is feeling well! I’ve been thinking things were going bad since no word for a while!  Love Osso with the couch! He really didn’t want it gone! 🥰 Great job on the new room, it looks beautiful! Hugs to you both! ❤️❤️ and a pat for Osso!
You guys are just the best ❤️ love you so much xx
Good to see y'all this morning. I look forward to Sunday mornings and what y'all are up to.  (Osso is adorable). My prayers continue for you both and for your families as Bec heals. Hugs and love.
Love you guys so much!
Speedy recovery Bec 💋
Much love and strength to you both—this to shall pass; brighter days are coming ☀️sending positive energy your way every day
I was afraid to ask about Tim... thanks for getting back to it- and giving us an opportunity to say hi to Bec! Have you priced out real windows for the porch- even with screens/storm window options for summer/winter use? I can’t imagine that screens and plexiglas will be great for sub-zero weather.
Oso for the win.
Your dog Oso is such a funny, goofy and a wonderful blessing to your family.....
Eamon, you are a rockstar! I was with my dad in chemo. Before covid they let patients take a support person with them. It was really important to him that I was there and he would only eat the food I made for him. That helped me feel like i could actually DO something for him. All of the little things you do for Bec matter so much. You will get through this!!! ❤️ 🙏🏻 for both of you!!!
I love yalls studio!
Wow, what a video.  Eamon your creativity is amazing. It blows my mind to see how your mind works and how good you are at building.  I hope you got a permit!!!I really appreciate the update about how hard Bec's illness is for you as  well. Bec, you continue to be so strong and positive. So glad you have so much support as well. I will continue to send positive energy your way
Bec is such a warrior! The fact that her body is going through so much and she’s still does so much and tries to do even more is incredible. Stay positive y’all, sending love always!
Really enjoyed this video. I appreciate both of you for your balance of strength and vulnerability.   So incredible to see a space transform soooo much! It's crazy to see that shot of the cabin from when you first bought it, and remember all the changes it has gone through to become your own little castle in the woods 🏚➡🏰✨
That room looks AMAZING!! You are such a great person and hubby Eamon, you are very brave! Glad to see Bec, can't wait to see the update video!!
Amazing transformation! You complement each other so well in every aspect of life. You've got this! ❤
WE LOVE OSO!!!
Oh lovley to see you this week you have been missed.but no rush to film just  look after yourselves. Your going through  all sorts right now so you need lots of time for each other.that room is great what a massive difference so light and bright.Eamon wish i could swing from the roof llike that but  at 75 im hard pressed to lift my arms above my  head  .take csre  both  love from England💜💙
God bless you both during this time! You are both amazing people and soon you will be able to look back on this chapter and look forward to all the amazing things life has  in store for you. ❤️
Ohmy Oso completely made my day 😂
💕
So happy to see Bec. What an amazing positive attitude you manifest and Eamon you are a wonderful support person! Great job on the new room! Love you guys!
Wow! That looks amazing! Great job everyone! 🥰🥰
Eamon you are incredibly!  Prayers continue for you and Bec.
Recipe please!
Eamon I'm sending you a Hudge bear bro hug man. Bec you absolutely rock the baldness, you're so beautiful. Oso had me rolling when they were taking the couch out. See you Sunday.
Been 🙏🏻🙏🏾🙏 for you all 🙋 so happy to see you guys💞 Oso is so funny I hope you keep him 💖  Special hug's 💞 been missing you guys🐶😢🙀☕🔥🦋
Loved the porch! I think a gym like this will get me started on my first workout, thanks for the inspiration once again!
Aww what a cool place you made, thank you for the update ❤
so great to see you . beautiful design for your porch and while you both are showing the strain you do look good all things considered.  just remember cancer doesn't define who or what you are. this is but a blip on your life's agenda and you are both bigger than it is. oso is a gem. I hope he is a foster fail. stay strong and keep those you love close to you.
Awe! This was so tender! Bec, you are amazing, you seem to do the self care ~well which is not only good for your healing journey but a great example to the other peeps who may be going through a health challenge too. Eamon. Eamon. When you started to talk, looking directly into the camera, upclose, bearing your soul (dang you are a cutie!)  I got up close to the computer and it felt like you were talking to me, I was crying. You have really stepped up to this plate as caregiver, not only to Bec but Oso-(oh so obsessively-active puppy), I loved the scene with the couch, what is that with dogs? Their way to tell you its time to stop working and play?  Anyway, you two have an amazing supportive family, they are wonderful! I am glad to see Bec looking so good. I love you all! Oma.
You have done such an amazing job! Congratulations! Our prayers are with you all!
Thank you so much for sharing I've been wanting to ask how you're doing Plus you try and act so  strong but I know you must be scared so know that we all are supporting both you and Bec and this too shall pass it's  going to be okay for both of you and this will be a distant memory I was so excited to see that a video was coming out Eamon it's good that you're expressing yourself because you can't keep this bottled up inside it's scary so now that we are all here to listen The Good The bad the ugly.  Bec we love you and know your going to conquer and destroy.  Much love XOXOXO
We’ve missed you guys 💓💓
Your dog 'loves' his 🛋. Bless his doggy heart.
Thank you for your openness eamon! 🥰 Stay strong … there will be better times again 🌷☀️🌷 Love and good energy to both of you!👩🏻‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻
Feel better Bec🙏🙏
Oh so funny with the couch!
Love that dog! Positive thoughts for Bec, Eamon and both your families. The work out room is awesome! Great job
Omg your dog had me laughing out loud so many times! What a legend 😂😂
I find myself during the day thinking about you Bec, how you’ve been doing during the day and praying for your strength and for your body to heal and heal every single day 🤍 you guys are amazing and without seeing the video yet, I just wanted to let you guys know that even we can be strangers to each other, there’s a lot of love coming my way, my family’s way to you guys. 🤍 now I’ll watch the video 🤍 see you Sunday! 😘
Glad to see the 2 of you working together during this time making your space beautiful as always. Staying normal is great. I'm so great full to you for sharing this journey an it may save my life. I never self checked now have my first mammogram coming up an I felt something. Its probably nothing but  your the awareness have made to your viewers was reaching.
Love you guys! You are both awesome. Love the new space! It's gorgeous and motivating. I look forward to Bec's update. ❤
How dare you take away that furbaby's couch!  He loves that thing!  I hope you got him a new huge orthopedic for bed!  Blessing to you all...sending good healing karma your way.
Eamen, you do a Great job!! On your videos........
Absolutely incredible. The transformation of the room and the vulnerability you guys provide in this space. Really sending prayers and light to you guys.

Tim's Biggest Fans are here. jkjk. We love you Eamon and Bec. You both are so much stronger than you know and You are inspiring how you share so vulnerably! Sending you both so much love, healing vibes, patience, and understanding!!!
Bear has made my day! Watch out……he is fast becoming the star in your videos! So happy to see a post from you. You are always in my thoughts and prayers. Eamon, this disease is a family disease. You will all be affected and you will all need love and support from everyone that comes into your lives. Bec….you look wonderful! Of course it is impossible for a lady that is so naturally beautiful inside and out to not shine through. This will all be behind you in no time. Oh…..and the room looks great! 🥰
No kidding, I was walking back from the beach and I said to my hubby “I am looking forward to watching my Sunday Utube videos but I am missing Eamon & Bec.  I hope they are doing ok.  I am a little worried”.  Boy was I pleased to watch your video.  Tears and laughter.  Great job on porch/gym/loft.  So pleased to see you and your helpers.  Stay strong and sending more positive vibes.  Xx
Dude u r doing so well with everything
I love Oso so much. What a great buddy.
Is oso your dog?
Hello you two, you're doing so great - both of you. Send you greetings from winterly south of Germany :-)
Love you guys so much!! Thank you for making these videos throughout this incredibly difficult and emotional time. They bring so much light and joy to my life and Oso is such a great addition to the pack, I have never laughed so hard in the first 5 minutes of a video!! xoxo wishing you all the love and healing.
LOL - give him back his couch!!!😂😂
love you guys!❤
We love you
Missed you guys! Happy to see you 🌹❤️ Love from Greece 🌼
Such a nice feeling seeing bec out working at the end of the video, can’t even put into words. So inspiring, unreal! Keep on trucking guys we love you
Prayers and loooots of love to both of you.
Bec you look amazing as always.  Don't feel bad for needing to take breaks.  Proud of you for listening to your body!  Eamon, I always see my lil brother when I look at you as you remind me so much of him.  So this comes from a sister point of view.  It's ok if you need to share how your feeling whether with Bec, friends or family, Better Help.  Try to take care of your own mental health too bub.   I'm sure this is heavy for you too, watching the person you love most in this world, fight for her life.  Don't feel like you have to hold it all in.   So incredibly proud and in awe of you both.  ❤️  All the love, healing prayers, & extra big Hugs for you both & Oso Bear!  House is so beautiful!!
Both of you are such stars in my eyes! My family is going through a cancer diagnosis just this past week and often though of your journey. Really nice to see you. Thanks so much. ❤️🇨🇦❤️
So much love to the both of you sending light and love. Eamon you are the best support anybody could ever ask for Bec is so lucky.
I think about you guys everyday. Glad to see everyone is doing well.  Sending lots of love and big hugs your way❤
Comment
Wauw guys it looks amazing!! Good to see you. Hugs from the Netherlands.
Love you guys! Room looks amazing!!! You got this Bec 🥰🥰🥰
The room looks AMAZING!  Was soooo glad to see a video up this morning!  Bec keeping up the fight you’re doing great!  Eamon thanks for being vulnerable about where you’re at, that important!  And I noticed you said “my dog” PLEASE PLEASE say you guys are keeping Bear….he is amazing and i truly believe you two are his home! ♥️
BEC,, may i just say that i think you look fantastic.
Love you guys.💜⚘️💜
Proud of you both! God bless you guys!
🌹🌹❤❤🌹🌹🦆
Big hugs coming from Dartmouth Nova Scotia. You are a true team. I. Lu guys and dog. Porch is coming. Take a deep breathe and   I. Lu your videos. Stay strong. You guys got this. Kisses coming from Grandma. Here. ❤️❤️🎁🎁🎁🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
You guys are awesome! I laughed so hard at Osso and the couch. He looks like a dog I had named Buddy. He was the greatest dog!  It's nice to see you do projects again and you're right Eamon, keeping busy is so important when going through something this difficult. The caretakers get forgotten but they need care too. You're such a good husband to Becky. She's incredibly lucky to have you. You have to be a good part of why she's so positive. You guys will get through this and come out stronger. Keep being awesome!
Eamon you are there for Bec. Way to go. Take time to rest. Family is amazing. Love to you two. Scratches for doggie woof.
I'm so very proud of you. You the strongest woman I've ever known. My prayers and lots of love to you beautiful lady.❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️
thinking of Bec , lots of love - stay strong and smiling
take a shot every time eamon says "no oso!!!" 😂 amazing video! keep healing, bec. love you both!!! also - great seeing tim and the whole fam come up and join!!
Buddhist monks do that coloring and that technique to heal people.
What a Beautiful healing space!
You are both so inspiring and strong! I have loved watching all of your videos and am in complete awe of you both and how you tackle  everything that comes your way with such positivity, strength, humour and awareness! It's so easy to fall into such a rut and negative mindset when faced with struggles and I admire and strive to make each day count the way you both do. You are both such inspirations both together as a couple and as individuals. Thank you for sharing yourselves and your experiences.  You both help me so, so much with my own day to day life, struggles and and my journey to become a better person and parent for myself and my babies. Thank you again! I am certain you are but take care of yourselves and eachother ❤️ Ashlee from Perth, Western Australia
So happy to see you both. Bec you look amazing,  and Eamon is the best support.   Mosso (soory if spelled wrong) loves his mommy and daddy. He is the best dog.    Eamon  showing emotions is strength, your human and your never ending love for bec is amazing.  Positive thoughts to you all, you  both made me smile today. 💖
Two of the most positive, lighthearted and encouraging people I’ve never met... yet I feel like I’m on the journey with you. Sharing the hardest times with the world is helping so many others and making people feel less alone. Can’t praise Eamon and Bec enough for just being great humans ❤️🥰
Aw Eamon, we love you too. You did an amazing job on the weight room. LOVE IT. Bec is so lucky to have you and such an awesome family always there to support you both. Sending so much light & love to you all. Oso Bear just cracks me up, love that boy so much. Be sure to give him big belly rubs from me. Luv you guys!
Being a care giver for so many people in my family through the years I know your feelings for you to express them is so good because care giving is harder than parenting unless your child has a serious illness or disability.so many emotions so much love .keeping you both in my prayers. Your dog and the couch was hilarious 😂.
We love you Bec, but Eamon may have a new partner in Oso. Much love and hugs to you both. ❤️
We’re all here for both of you every step of the way ❤️
Love you guys so much. You are so extraordinary and the house looks amazing ❤️🌸
In case Oso ever needs a cone again, I highly recommend getting one of the soft ones. They don’t hurt if he runs into you and they last much longer!
Prayers
So happy to see you are both doing well! Amazing room! Happy for Osso! Keep doing you ❤️❤️❤️
Ozo and the Couch!  Funniest video I've seen in a very long time!  Love and hugs to you all and your families ❤
Sending so much love to both of you (Oso included) ... the porch is gorgeous - you've done an amazing job on it. Bec, you look beautiful.  Our weather has been crazy, hasn't it? Mother Nature in Ontario is really annoying right now lol.
Awesome videos sorry I’m so late
It’s a good look wow one million subscribers!!!!
It looks fantastic! So nice to have a wall by the entrance with multi functional purposes. The ladder having round rungs will be hard on the feet but hey your young and you won’t notice until your much older lol
You got this girl .. you are strong and beautiful and you got this.. your Angell Lee has been by ur side I hope you know that love you from Massachusetts
Ahh, how could you get rid of Oso's couch 😢
What a wonderful notification to receive this morning ☺️. Eamon you beaut. It looks amazing!! So happy to see you guys keeping busy and staying positive. Much love! ❤️
I love you so much, though I don't know you personally, I have been following you now for 2~ years and I've loved every video you uploaded! I keep you in my prayers <3
Oso is going to lick you to death.
I look forward to these videos so much I can't even explain it! It was really nice to see that vulnerable side of you Eamon - shows how strong you really are. All love to the both of you❤️
Eamon,  You and Bev don’t owe anyone anything.  Love is not transactional.  It’s just love.  Your viewers, followers, patrons, or whatever we all are, just want you both to be able to heal from this and get on with your beautiful lives.  You give so much of yourselves- it’s okay to just be loved and supported.   All my prayers and best wishes,  💕💕💕💕
Sending you love, prayers, and healing thoughts your way Beck. Not many people can pull off the bald look but you Beck look sexy as heck. Eamon you are amazing at supporting your woman no matter how difficult it must be for you❤️
.love you guys so much. I feel like you are a part of my family and I'm very proud of you both lots of hugs and prayers
Loved watching this video it was nice to see you guys back. The space is absolutely amazing. It looks so peaceful.    I appreciate your openness Eamon. It’s not easy watching a loved one go through something so difficult but your love and support will help make life just a little bit easier. You are doing a great job. And I love seeing Bec’s positivity through all of this. It is going to help so many people going through the same thing.
Wow impressive. Love your style.
Adding that little wall to divide off "entrance" from "workout" areas made all the difference. Great vision and execution on this one. And I totally get the need to stay busy... so awesome to see you do something so productive with your time that will be enjoyed for years to come.
So happy to see things a bit more positive for you guys❤ You both deserve that sooo much. The room looks absolutely amazing!! Need to hire you guys to come do my house😂 As always my love and prayers are with you both❤ Hope you have a great week!
You guys are so amazing and strong. Always thinking of you❤
LOVE YOU BEC
What bread of dog is Osso?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oso had me in stitches!! 🤣🤣
Eamon you are truly talented. Being vulnerable is scary and uncomfortable.  Thank you for sharing. Bec looking strong as ever.
Hey I’m Katina I never comment ,but when I saw you had up a video I was so happy it made my day. I’ve been pray for you. Love you channel I always watch every Sunday. Be blessed get well soon.
Awesome video! So great to see Tim ❤️❤️. How lucky you are to have Oso! Ugh, what a sweetheart. I played Whitney Houston’s “I will always love you” while you were taking the couch away ha ha. Eamon, thank you for sharing your vulnerability. It is so incredibly difficult to accept when we are powerless. I find the easiest way is to trust that the universe doesn’t make mistakes and everything will work out as it’s supposed to. Unfortunately, I have no say in the outcome, so I try to remain present and live one moment at a time. Love to you both! I’m thinking about you every day!
Take care of yourself, Eamon.
Continue to stay 💪 both of u!!❤❤🐾
I’m so excited that there’s a video today! I adore you guys and definitely look up to you both. And it’s like I’ve gone a while without seeing good friends.  I wish for the absolute best for both of you -  Bec, you are so amazingly strong and inspiring. Eamon, you too are so amazingly strong and inspiring. I’m in awe by the way y’all navigate through life.
Hi guys.  It's great to see both of you.  Eamon,  you're doing a great job. Bec, you're looking great.  The workout room looks amazing.  I'm keeping you both in my thoughts.
Xoxo
Thanks for the honesty. In some ways it’s harder on the partners.

Such a funny beginning with Oso. Love you guys!
Oso’s battle with his cone is the visual representation of why he is perfect for your family…no matter what the difficulty or unforeseen obstacles, that sweet guy still finds joy.  Praying still for you both.
Its so good to see you both.. the renovation looks awesome.. and Bec im looking forward to your update.. At my half way point during my chemo journey they did a pet scan.. have you gotten yours yet?

Bec looks awesome and I love the new room. Great ideas Eamon
Eamon you are a really good supportive partner and it's okay to let go of control especially with stuff you literally cannot control! Bec I'm glad to see that positive attitude still going strong! I have missed seeing you guys, I don't get on Instagram. The space turned out great! Sending prayers and good vibes!
So glad to see you guys again and see how you're doing.❤️ Your home is looking beautiful! Oslo added a bit of humor, and enjoyed watching your "adventures" with him as well.😅 Love and light to both of you. ❤️
Omg Oso with the couch. And then the cone, poor baby bear ... I laughed, I cried... sending  hugs 🫂 .  Eamon you are doing great and it's OK to cry. Glad to see Bec is up and about and continuing to do so good.
I love you guys and glad to hear that things are going well
Nothing like old good reno ;) Great to see you guys keeping it positive in the not so positive period. All the best!
So glad to see you all again and your extended family .... good health to Bec.  Great that you topped 1M subscribers....   Oso is  super addition... has to be the #1 animal on the Tube!
Beautiful transformation of the space. I'm sure it will bring you much joy to spend time there as you heal and beyond💞
So happy to see this update and  missed your cabin/home reno videos ... including Tim 😁.  Glad to see you are still plugging away at life 🤗.  Poor Oso was apparently really attached to that couch lol ... too funny!
Love love love this. You two are super inspiring as always. Eamon you are so clever that space looks amazing. My favourite part has to be Oso and the couch🤣🤣🤣 thank you for sharing and continued prayers for your journey
Amazing work guys, it looks wonderful!  All the best to both of you during such a difficult and challenging time.  Bec, I hope you continue to heal and feel 100% very soon! xoxo
Happy Sunday so happy to see you guys! You did an amazing job on the porch it looks fantastic. Sending lots of love and prayers to you both!
Amazing job on the sunroom it looks amazing and so healing, the one thing I think would complete the room is sound bowls!! I’m so glad to see you and bec are taking everything in stride and not being hard on yourselves about keeping your posting schedule regular.  As a community I think we can all agree it’s amazing that you are being so open with your journey and raw with your emotions it’s truly a blessing to be an observer to your beautiful lives. You can feel the love through the camera and that speaks volumes ❤
Work out room looks great! Nice job!
Oso CRACKS me up so hard omg 😆
Thats one very very funny pooch you have , he s into everything .plus a big plus he makes Becs smile come out even when she s feeling rough , So emmy award to SUPERDOG.
Beautiful! You look amazing Bec ! Eamon you and your helpers did a fabulous job and I am happy to see you have so much family support Xx
I thought these van builds were awesome... turns out that was only the beginning of Eamon's incredible design brain!!!!!
Eamon, you're amazing. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing how you've been. It is so nice seeing a different family member in each stage of the renovation. I am so so so so proud of you all and am always looking forward to more videos of Bec gaining energy and recovering ❤️❤️ Love you guys
These edits are just getting better and funnier love it
Prayer to you both
Thank you both for sharing! Eamon, it was a great vlog :) thank you for opening up about how you’re feeling. This big wonderful community is absolutely pulling for you both. We are sending you love, strength and support 💛 ☀️ 🌻
i didn’t think it was possible to miss and love someone you’ve never met so much. both of you are absolute inspirations and i want to thank you for being such lovely humans! sending lots of love and healing your way 💕
So good to see and hear you guys are doing as well 🤗 Much love to you both. 💕 Sorry poor Oso lost his 🐕 🛌
I have said a prayer for all of you every day since I learned of this season in your lives. For your parents, siblings, friends, but mostly for the two of you. I cherish my moments of discovery and inspiration from your channel as I seek to create a similar experience for twins whose twins have passed. As a surviving twin I have come to realize how critical our mental space is for our survival. What a gift to witness your fortitude, even in your darkest moments. Immense TWIN LOVE to you both. ❤️❤️
:)) The dog was so funny with the couch and so cute watching birds!
Loved the video! Seeing you back at the job site was a HUGE bright spot on my week. My husband and I were laughing so hard at Oso and that couch! The room turned out great, and it was so nice to see you both! Thank you for the update, and will continue to send love, prayers, and positive vibes your way!
Omg so happy to see a video. We've been so worried about our beautiful Bec. Ok going to watch 😆
This video made my Sunday morning. Thank you! Kudos to all who helped you in the remodeling. It came out beautiful! And...gotta say...Oso definitely stole the show. 😆
You are both wonderful with your honesty and you beautiful heart.
Payers to you both
Eamon my man As the friend of a stage 4 cancer patient i can tell you even the strongest most supportive husbands dont last. Unfortunately divorce is extremely high among cancer patients even my friend who had a husband very similar to you only lasted 4 years and she is 6 years into this (they were married 17 years) i know the love you have for bec and I hope it doesn't waver. Cancer is a life long journey and never goes away. Bec is a strong woman and I know she will come out on top
What a sweet space you have made! The little loft will look great with fairy lights. So glad to see you both; been a bit worried for you, ngl. . Eamon, your drive and ability are impressive. What a terrific couple you make. Big hugs to you both and also to Oso
You guys are an inspiration and always cheer me up when I'm feeling down and make me laugh out loud with some of the crazy stuff you get up to. So I'm sending you guys some love and positive thoughts from Liverpool in the UK. 🙏❤️❤️
God bless your family 👍
OKAY NOW HECK YEAH, YOU LOOK SO GOOD BEC EVEN WITH NO HAIR!! WATCH OUT G.I. JANE!!!!
I don't usually comment. I'm just usually a bystander. But given the circumstances, I think I should say something about Bec's situation. I don't want to fall into cliches, nor is it that I'm very good with these things. So I'll just say that if this had happened to you 10 years in the future we would probably have a cure by now. Probably. But since it was not like that, FIGHT. Because you're in a war girl. And losing is not an option. Losing or giving up is NEVER an option. We fight with what we have. With EVERYTHING we have so that in the end in victory or defeat we have no regrets. WIN. You can. (sorry for my translate inglish, im a little rusty XD)
Hahaha I think there is enough Oso content for his own YouTube channel. What a delight he must be for the two of you during this trying time. So glad to see Bec’s up days. You got this girl.  BTW, great job on the exercise/sun room.
Great Job!
Wow. Eamon, you are very talented. I’m always impressed by the projects you and Bec do. I also think it brings you joy to make something amazing. Good that you found a project while Bec is focusing on her health. Bec, hope you are doing well with your liquid sunshine. Hugs and positive thoughts to you both!
An amazing support system you both have in your lives. Great family!
Bec prayers and Emon that’s a fantastic job you did what a statement it makes
Made my day seeing your video pop up as you've both been in my thoughts constantly wondering how you are doing.  What amazing families you have, all coming over to help out, such love and support.  The transformation is awesome, I love it and having everything set up will make working out so  much easier.  Oso's antic had me crying. He really loves that old couch. Hilarious.   Eamon I'm so glad you spoke out. It is just as hard on the caregiver as on the person affected by cancer because you feel so powerless and watching your loved one go through hell is really really difficult, but you two are such a team and you will get there and put all of this behind you. Stay strong xx
Thank you Eamon and Bec for another youtube video. You are in my Prayers
So nice to see you guys. The new frontroom is gorgeous. The dog.. He is a big goofball, what a special soul! Take care guys, spring is around the corner, sun and warmth to give you both energy.
It was so good to see both of you!!  Your room turned out fantastic.  Emon, its so cool to see your visions come to life.  Thank you for your update, I can't imagine how hard this is, illness give us no control over anything.  Bec, you look great, I am so happy you are having some good days and that you are on the downhill side.  You are going to be done in no time.  Thanks for taking us along and your positive energy is so uplifting.  Take care both of you.
Sending lots of love and strength to both of you - my hubby starts chemo this week for multiple brain tumours, so Eamon I feel for you - it’s very hard to be the caregiver but you are an icon and are doing really well, wishing you both good health 💕
Good to see you guys! Thanks for the updates, sending <sun> and <love>
Jesus is the Only Way Truth and Life  🙏Turn to Jesus 🙏
Omg, that was too funny. Oh-so and his couch 🛋.
YOUR PLACE LOOKS SO GOOD EAMON AND BEC! I ;LOVE YOU 2 SO MUCH AD WISH YOU NOTHING BUT PURE JOY AND HAPPINESS!!!!
Wow you covered off every emotion in there for all of us. So glad you are half way through Bec!  Oso is. super star. Sure made me laugh. Thanks Eamon for sharing with us, difficult but much appreciated. Gym is stunning and going to be a place of healing and I bet lots of laughs too. Sending warmth and healing vibes your way.
You guys are honestly amazing. Hope bec gets better
You guys have brought that cabin so far from the beginning.   Be proud
So lovely to see you all big hugs xx
OMG!! Oso makes me wanna run to the closest shelter and adopt another dog!!! 💜   Bec, you’re the bravest! 💪🏻
Oso getting on the couch made me laugh so much 🤣😂 poor little buddy lost his couch!! Praying for you guys, I think you guys are rockstars. Sending lots of love and hugs - thanks for the update!! Love the ways this room ended up, GREAT JOB 💪🏻
🤗
Omg. Give that dog his couch back!💜
I'm so excited to see you have a new video I'm going to like it before i watch it.. Praying for you both.. Bec you always look so amazing..
From #Morocco 😍😍😍😍💗💗💘
Lots of fun in this video - fun and love and the meaning of life!  Thanks to Eamon and Bec for sharing yourselves even when life is challenging and sharing feels...exhausting, vulnerable, or scary.  Thanks to your family and friends who are jumping in to ease your days and nights.  I'm wishing all good things to you and your loved ones. Sending love and hugs in my heart to you both.  The new studio looks fabulous!!! :)
All of the Oso antics cracked me up!    You have all been in my thoughts and prayers, so I’m glad to see the update.  Hang in there, you’re doing great!
I love you guys ! Bec your doing great knowing you’re limits but still trying , Eamon your love for Bec makes me so happy . Your so caring and attentive but I love that you let her do what she feels she can do ! Also I know Oso is a foster but he completes you guys and he’s been with you guys during this incredibly tough time . He’s family now 100%!!!
Truly inspirational!❤️
The room looks fantastic. I believe in spring will have a gorgeous view over the lake. It is great you are keep doing projects. It helps to keep your minds busy and gives you continuity in life. "Hey we are living to this tough moments, but there is a lot of life to live" Bec looks fantastic, full of life and energy. You are both very brave. Congratulations for the new gym it really looks beautiful. Go Eamon, go Bec, go Bec, go Eamon
My girlfriend literally cried because she was so happy to finally see you upload and just be happy again.
Thanks for the huge belly laughs at the Oso couch moving debacle. 😂🐻🤣
Love you guys. Much love to you both.  Eamon that room is absolutely amazing!!  Loved watching the transformation.  Great to see you both.  Eamon I can not imagine how hard this whole thing has been for you.  I think the hardest part when a loved one is ill is the inability to fix it, make it better or go away. The lack of control would be exceptionally hard to cope with at times. Thank you for opening up.  Again that room is amazing!!
Wow! That room looks fabulous!! I am totally stealing your weight storage idea. Congratulations you two on being halfway done with chemotherapy! Love to you both from Fallbrook, CA.
Eamon and Bec it is so good to hear from you. Sending love and prayers. I was laughing at Oso getting on the couch as Eamon and Tim were trying to move it. I love the renovated   room. Great vlog.😊❤🙏💐
its gonna be fine buds.  God's plan sometimes tests one's faith.
You both are so sweet! Your cabin Is looking amazing! Greatings from Argentina
So good to see you both again!! Eamon, great job bud on the room! Wow! Bec, you’re so beautiful! You two are such an inspiration for so many things in life. Many blessings upon you both! ❤️
You both look good. Lots of light coming from you. So good to see!      I LOVE "Little Bear" - Ohso. He's such a great dog and just the best boy!  He is your "meant to be" - sent where he was needed. I hope he stays with you. He's such a love!
You are amazing Eamon you are such a wonderful soulmate for Bec. You are a great couple and sending both you and Bec healing love and a lot of respect. God Bless you both.
wow! now that is an outstanding room. the place is a blissful dream ( the entire house). so wonderful to see that you both have help from family and friends. i am sending a warm virtual hug to you both and a huge kiss to Oso. love that puppy dog.
Handyman tip #332.  If the holes are too big for the screw head, re-drill smaller holes.  You can even drill a chamfer to sink the head and make it look real sexy.  :-)    Sending positive vibes your way bud!
Oso is the dopiest, sweetest good boy. Sending love to you peeps!
Finally, my dog has met his cone-destroying match in Osso
Oso said Noso !!! 😂😂😂😂😂🤷🏾
Puppers’ love of that couch is the vibe ❤️
Love you guys!!!!....Thank you for the Eso and his couch laughs this morning....
I am sorry. But Oso made this entire video.
I never knew I could feel so proud and so inspired by people I've never met. I've been watching your journey from nearly the beginning and it's been so great seeing your adventures every week. Bec you are so positive and strong and just such an amazing and beautiful human being, which has always been apparent but watching your fight has been so inspiring. Eamon seeing you as such a supportive and strong partner to Bec has been amazing, your love for Bec shines through and it's beautiful to see two people so in love and working so hard for each other. I wish nothing but the best for both of you and can't wait to witness a summer of healing. Love from Kingston, ON <3
I was starting to wonder what was happening with you both. I am glad to see this video.  Looking forward to the healing continuing to a complete recovery.
You both inspire and amaze me daily. My whole heart is with you right now. Keep being a gorgeous light in this world. 💜
My mom had breast cancer & treatment, right after I lost my father to a overdose. There’s an unmatched feeling of sadness & helplessness when dealing with these things. My heart is with you guys. Prayers for strength, positivity & much much love to you guys. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
That room looks amazing! Love you both! Sending nothing but good vibes.
I’ve been so worried. I’m so happy to see you.  Beck you are a true inspiration.  I love you guys and are praying for you. Eamon your love and support is truly the real deal Holyfield!❤️.
It's so good to see you! Oso - what a love, and such a goof. The new room - incredible. Your family - so game to jump in and help. You two - sending so much love.
Loving the adventures of Oso and Eamon!
Is osseo your new pet for forever he is the cutest
🙏❤💪
Your new gym looks awesome.  What a great job. Is Oso a keeper?   He is such a wonderful member of the family but I know you have been fostering dogs in the past, so I hope he is here to stay.   Keeping you all in my heart and full of admiration for the way you are handling everything.  You are so inspiring.
1) Oso needs visitation rights for his old couch that Tim 'borrowed'... 2)  Poor Oso... cone of shame?!  I laugh at you!!  3)  I'm with you Eamon - you hang in there buddy!  Stay on the '+' side!  🤜🤛  4)  Workout porch entrance thing looks sharp you two!
Relieved to know how you both are managing this challenge. Though you actually owe the viewers nothing- there is no obligation- thank you for sharing. There are so many lessons that we can learn from your honesty, your courage, your vulnerability, your love and your commitment to each other. Continued prayers, continued admiration, continued hopefulness, continued loving positivity to you both from a little old lady in Missouri.👍👏❤️🙏🏻
I can tell from this video you are starting to see the ups and downs of having a dog (from almost stepping in paint to being hilarious and hopping on the couch). Either way dogs are the best (I have one lol). The place is continuously looking better and better it looks amazing! Love and best wishes to all from a fellow Ontarian
So much love oozes through the screen to us. You are both so amazing. Sending LOTS of love.
Loved seeing your whole crew come together for this beautiful project! Great job everyone! I laughed, I cried, I’m loving whatever you choose to share with us right now. Much love and healing vibes coming your way from Chicago! You got this Bec!
The DOG....LOLOLOLOLOL
Laughed and cried hard during this ! Love you guys ❤
Love you guys! Wish you both a lot of health♥ Bec, you are so strong and great!!:) Eamon, you are amazing and so sweet!
Thirty-seven year bone cancer survivor here and I would not have made it through those two years without a strong, supportive husband, children, friends and family. The outpouring of love was the best medicine. And Bec,  I hit another Dark Night of the Soul patch in 2019 & 2020 when I helped both of my parents navigate their passings. I was drawn to a mandala coloring book and it was such healing Zen for me too. I put all of the mandalas in a notebook and it is fun to look at and once again be grateful for my strength and the faith that carried me through those dark times. You got this girl xo
Oh my god I love that dog SO MUCHA!!!
That room looks amazing guys, i missed you these last few Sundays. So happy everyone is staying strong and so positive throughout everything. Love you all…see you next Sunday?
When you licked her head I lost it 😂😂 Eamon, you’re a truly inspiring person in so many ways.
What a lovely couple you are. You complement one another so perfectly. Prayers going up a lot and a big virtual hug to both of you, and Oso!
I enjoyed watching this video. The funny Bear footage. I was laughing out loud so much. Especially the couch being moved. He did not want it to go 🤣. E opening up about your struggle while being B’s rock. The love shows 💕 May God continue to give you the blessing needed to open the vision of your future. Prayers and Peace towards your way. 🙏🏼🤙🏽
ive been missing you guys <3 <3 <3 very happy to see beck up and around, as soon as I can, I'll be up to drop off some help for beck and your channel, hope to see you guys (eomons dad ) sometime this month, love you guys, hang in there..............
HUGS my thoughts are with you both
Been missing you guys. Good to see Bec is doing goos. Bec you rock that look. Hair or no hair,  you look great. Looking forward seeing next episode, and update on Bec health. Stay safe you two
I was beyond relieved to see a video again!!! I've been soo soo worried about you guys!
❤️💙🤍🧡💚💛❤️💙🤍🧡💚💛❤️
This dog is HYSTERICAL! Lucky boy to find you and lucky you to have him in your world… 💕💕💕
WOWWWW! What a beautiful transformation! Thank you for the update. Eamon, you’re amazing. It’s so nice to see the family helping out and to see Bec’s beautiful smile. Much love and well wishes to you guys, as always. 💗
BIG LOVE and Lots of HUGS! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So much respect. Love you two. Nice to see the in-laws. And Bec … what a trooper! Eamon, your sun porch is beautiful. 🌺🌸🌺
What happened to the chipmunk that lived in the shed? We're with you and Bec through this emotionally draining time.....thanks for just being you...that's why we love watching
The porch looks Amazing!!!!! GREAT JOB EVERYONE!!❤
Beautiful video as always. You guys are doing fantastic job at the cabin. Love of love for you two. Looking forward to watch Becs video. 😘😘
when i heard of the cancer i was triggered to send my prayers. but when i read my message back it sounded like my own hormone thearapy talking.... super moody, not the encouragement i intended... omg... forgive me... i dont comment much...you guys are the best...all my love and humility!!!
So good to see you guys.  Well done Bec on getting 1/2 way with your treatment!!!!  Eamon you are 1 in a million.  Your love and support of Bec is admirable.  Oso is a hoot - jumping on his couch 😀😀.  Thoughts and prayers for the two of you. ❤️❤️❤️
Little cone head baby 🐾 it’s extremely hard for Bec and you Eamon. But you guys will get through this! ❤️ just keep doing what you are doing! Stay positive even though it’s hard at time but everything will be okay 💕
We love you guys so much! Eamon, that front porch looks unreal!! You guys have literally built the coolest cabin we've ever seen. We're so proud of you guys and are praying for you everyday❤
Eamon fyi - In England you wont get a mortgage on a house with a spray foam roof insulation because if anything goes wrong with the roof eg tiles missing damp can be trapped in behind the foam and the rot wont be visible from inside.
Lump in my throat, take care both of you!
Sending you both lots of love and hugs ❤
Praying for you both.
Great job!!! It looks amazing!!! Sending prayers and love to the both of you.
Eamon you made a great vlog. Hugs to both of you!
So happy to see you guys! And happy to see Tim, too! 🥰
Sooo very nice to visit with you.  The couch move was more than I’ve ever seen around an animal’s attachment to furniture. Bec your head is beautiful.  Perfect shape in my view. I feel your emotions as Eamon took a sidebar with us.  You all are a habit I want to keep.  Thanks for sharing.  Looks like prayers are supporting upbeat outlook in the day to day.  Good dog love is priceless.
🤗
Hang in there guys
Eamon, you've brought to light the big picture of cancer. It not only affects the patient, but EVERYONE! Cancer is the burden of the patient. No one can carry that burden for them. Loved ones can help the patient hold up the burden, but it leaves the loved ones with helplessness, sorrow, etc. You both are amazing! Much love to you both! ❤
Love you guys. Your video is what I would call a rainbow, it made me laugh, cry and smile. Thanks for sharing. 💜🌈
I used gray foam carpet tiles in my van.  The first time I stepped on it with bare feet I thought I died and went to heaven.  It would make a great covering for the loft floor.
Oso has completely upstaged you with his couch and lampshade antics.  He's a star :)    Great job on the reno.   Hugs to you both and kudos on your love and strength.
❤️😘🥰❤️
When my daughter had cancer I let my mind go to those dark places until I got the right help.  Everytime it starts to go there stop and take inventory on reality.  Bec isn't dead, you aren't at the funeral, stop imagining what it would be like without her etc. I know all the dark places. Imagine sealing a door behind them and put yourself into your safe place. Say in your mind, going to your safe place now and mentally go there. While you are in your safe place repeat "The future hasn't happened, I can't change the past, the only time you really have is the amount of time it takes for me to look into your eyes and you look back." It's always had to live in the moment, but if you live in the future and past you will miss the current moment. Love you guys. Take care of your self Eamon. Care giver stress is real and will wipe you out as fast as the chemo wipes out Bec.
Not that I'm trying to dox you guys but I feel like I know that lake.
Anyone else catch the SpongeBob pencil behind Eamon's ear?? Goes perfectly with the time transitions, I love it!
I love you guys! It's amazing to see the progress on the cabin but also with liquid sunshine! Both of you seem to be doing better x
Just can't express how glad I am to see you, both. Love and prayers. Oh, the room looks excellent.
Looks so good. Wonderful to see Bec still trying to keep her great sense of humor. Girl you are Beautiful,  hair or no hair.
Funny , sweet , emotional and satisfying , this video had it all . Love and healing wishes , you guys are amazing 💞🐾🐾💞
Oso is just the best!!  He wants his couch dad!!  Bec, you are looking soooo beautiful and Eamon ever so handsome
It looks SO good! 🤩 Sending love and light to you guys 💛
Love the look in the porch area 😍 bec is looking very good 👍 love to do mandalas too. What brand of colored pencils are they?
Osoooooo 🥺😭
It's just not a Sunday without Eamon & Bec. Missed you guys.
Love seeing you guys this morning.  You guy's are so awesome...Oso included.  Really enjoyed this video.  Hilarious clip of Oso fighting for his couch and Ross too.  Keep Strong!  Prayers are with you!
Good to hear from you guys. Take care of each other first.
Looks incredible! I’m always so fascinated about how you can change spaces, you have such a good vision. Your home is so beautiful 😍
Sending you  n Bec warmth n sunshine from #Malaysia. Stay strong! And that doggie..with sofa..!:)
Aww Eamon. I Just wanted to give you a big hug there. Acknowledging that it’s hard is okay! Thanks for sharing❤️We can do hard things when we have connection and loved ones supporting us. Looks like you guys have amazing family and support.
Aww how lovely to see you back . 😍xx
It’s funny that I don’t even know you guys but you are in my thoughts so much. Sending much love your way. That dog you have is adorable btw!
Just sending my love and positive good vibes to you both, you don’t owe us anything, but I for one feel blessed that you choose too.  The space looks incredible! Bec, you are a true warrior with your knight Eamon by your side charging into this battle. Love you both 💕
How freaking funny when he jumped on the couch I love dogs I absolutely love them there better than humans.  The renovation looks awesome absolutely awesome enjoy it!
I so enjoy watching you guys,  I love the way you share your life with us. You guys are my favorite YouTube ❤ channel ❤. Get well soon Beck and stay strong Eamon. You guys are loved 🥰🥰🥰

All the fam cameos today! Eamon, your resilience and motivation for projects is unparalleled and it makes me want to go build something 😂 you rock!
Love and prayers are with you both.❤❤️🙏🙏
Oh guys!! So glad to hear from you. So worried about you Beck. Stay strong babygirl. Eamon, you too. Love you guys.🤗
All the healing prayers to Bec.  Cancer sucks, but you have this! Eamon, watching someone you love be sick in some ways is the hardest. Being supportive is those times can be rough.  The love you 2 share is inspiring.   much love and healing vibes from Oregon.
Love and light guys!! 💙
I was eagerly waiting for your next video to come out. I may not know either of you but I feel like I know and love you both. Sending all the best from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Eamon, you are such a bucket full of sunshine and Bec is so blessed to have you! As someone who suffers from organ failure, having a great support partner-lover is the key to helping them achieve good health. I love you guys as a beautiful little family. BEC you look great girl. Xxoo Britany, and the Decker's
Your all’s support system of family and friends is beautiful!!😊 The new porch/workout room/mini loft is absolutely amazing!! That cabin has come a long way! Can’t wait to see Bec’s update. Glad you know when to rest, it’s important. See you some Sunday!!! 😉🤗😊❤️
So great to see Bec. You two are awesome. 🙏 and 💕to you two
Oso is so funny!   He loves that couch 😃. It’s so nice to see you laugh.  Are you still fostering him?  He seems to like you a lot xxx Love to all.  💜
I missed these type of videos! The room looks amazing, well done!! Haven’t laughed that hard in a while, poor Oso and the couch ha ha. It’s so very nice to see Bec and see how she’s doing, but also to hear how you’re doing Eamon. It’s hard for any partners, friends and family for someone going through that as well. Just as important to make sure you are taking care of yourself as well. Lots of love and good thoughts for you both, you got this! Also, Oso’s little hopping after the ball is ADORABLE ha ha!
Love you guys so much! I pray for you both every day! You are both so strong. You just  amaze me with your love and support for each other. Thankyou for bringing so much joy and light to us all even in your difficult time. You are so appreciated. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💗💗💗💗💗
I’ve missed your faces so much over the last few weeks but I’m happy knowing you’re taking time to deal with the important stuff. We’re all gonna be here no matter what. Im sending all the good, healing, positive vibes that I can your way! You guys are the best! ❤️❤️

Loved everything about this!
Soooo much to say. Sending so much love to both of you. ❤️I am thankful that your family has been able to be there for you both, since I can only send you love.  To have Bec’s parents painting the trim was perfect, since Bec couldn’t. 😋 Loved seeing Oso licking Bec’s feet to make her feel better. Bec’s coloring looks fun. I’m going to get my coloring book out and do some of that today. Thank you Eamon for your sharing. It helped me with a situation that I’m going through. And I know what I’m having for dinner! Nice entry wall on both sides.  I love getting to see how much love the two of you have for each other and how proud you are. It deeply touches me.
So good to see yall taking it one day at a time. Praying for both of you. The porch  looks great.
LOVE the new room! It's so unique and works perfectly for the space you have! Eamon should be an interior designer!!! He's really got an eye for this stuff!! You're both doing so amazing and it's so good to see you guys post again with the same energy/approach to every video you make! Love you both and I'm glad you're doing well <3
Awesome Job 👌  Continued prayers for BOTH OF YOU 💜💚🎗🦋  Much Love ❤
Lots of love from India ❤️
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕👍👍👍
Looks amazing!! I so happy you two have each other the care and support and love is wonderful!
Thanks for sharing the good and bad! You guys have been an inspiration for your positive attitudes. You've got this!
I cannot believe after all these issues, you still advertise that shitty green powder!!!
Awww I have been praying, and looking and waiting for a video and I’m so happy to see all of you. The room is amazing, Bec you are doing so good! Keep resting and focusing on recovery and your health. This is such a good video and good for our soul as well. We have missed y’all.  🙏🏼❤️
Glad you have such a strong support system around you both! Also Oso is an amazing addition to the blog ! The cone situation hit as I also have a conehead dog atm such good comedy ahaha 😅! Sending all the positive vibes to you both! You got this !!
Eamon, my husband lived with cancer from 1986 until he passed in 2017 and it wasn’t the cancer that got him, it was medical errors. But I wanted you to know that I understand what you’re going through.  All you can do is be her “rock”! But don’t forget to take care of you too!! Don’t let your mind wonder to “what if”! And pray for strength and healing for both of you guys. You’re in my prayers, and I don’t take light of prayer! Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) does have more answers for cancer than anywhere I’ve ever been. They meet with the two of you and you have a team of specialists that patients see every time. I’ve seen them cure stage 4 brain cancer. Just look into them!! They even make wigs for patients, it’s an amazing place of hope and healing!
Am soooooo in love with Oso 🥰🥰🥰 he’s wonderful and his antics with that sofa will be legendary lol. Good to see you back on here again plus the room looks great 👍
Can’t help but cry happy tears watching so much love in one video. My mom was recently diagnosed with cancer, and your videos have not only helped me to stay positive but helped prepare me for what to expect with chemo and hair loss, and we even started calling chemo liquid sunshine. Sending love and strength your way!
Love you guys 💕
Great job guys! Stay strong Bec, and Eamon thanks for opening up about your struggles. Sometimes people forget how hard it is on the caregivers as well. My thoughts and prayers go out to you both. Your love is inspirational, take care. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
So good to see y’all, been so worried but haven’t missed a day saying a prayer for you both!! God is in Control and has an awesome plan for you guys!  ❤️❤️❤️
Sending you both so much love. Loved you guys for years Xx ❤️❤️🥰🥰
I think Bec would love crocheting, doesn't take much energy and it is a lot of fun. Sending my love!
Great job guys 👍
A rolled up towel ducted taped would have worked for Oso
❤️
Thoughts and prayers 💗🙏
Missed y’all! So glad to see your faces. Prayers are being sent your way, love the space❤️
You guys are incredible 🥺 Your relationship is beautiful and I’m so happy you two (+Oso) share your life with us. You’re always in my thoughts & I just know you both will come out of this even stronger (if possible!) Love you guys 🤍💪🏼
Eamon you did such a great job with this blog! Thanks for the little peek into your heart ☺️My bff is doing chemo for stage four pancreatic cancer right now, and seeing her very weak is 💔, so I feel you. Day by day! Those good days are so much sweeter now hey? Keep loving and laughing!
Beautiful space. Eamon you are doing great! It’s hard being the care taker, but it’s worth it. Bec can heal knowing you are taking care of everything else ! Love you guys
You  don't owe us anything Eamon. I can't even imagine how hard it must be. It's a lot to hold and carry. You are doing it right. Keeping busy, having friends and family around. It's hard to let the universe do it's thing.  Hoping in a couple months this will just be a dark memory that made you both appreciate the beauty of life more.
Thinking of y’all , love you guys! 💛💛
I'm so glad to hear from you both and lots of love and healing thoughts out to you Bec!
Oso and the couch was the BEST. You should make that into a tiktok or Instagram Reel!! Sending you all love & prayers <3 <3
Always look forward to your uploads, sending prayers becs way ♥️ love you guys so much.
im a cancer survivor... please know as a support person its so so important you give yourself as much grace as you are giving bec.
❤️💪🏼🤗
💕💕💕
Cant wait to watch this after work today. ❤ Also wanted to say that you two you have given me the courage to finally get a lump checked out...appointment this Thursday
SUCH A SMART AN AWESOME DOG
Your videos always get me out of bed and remember why I’m here! Make the most out of every day! Thanks for the reminder!
Sending love and prayers for you both ❤️
Eamon, huge props to you for sitting down and being open and honest about your feelings to the world - as a man, I know how hard it is to do this, even with close friends. I hope thousands of men are inspired by this video - being open in this way should not be taboo for men, everyone deserves to be heard regardless of their gender. Love to you and Bec ❤
You bec look fabulous  !!!!
Wow everyone looks wonderful thank you for the video. The room looks great. My thoughts and prayers are with you both always. 👍🙏🙏❤
I’ve been missing you two. I’ve been checking y’all channel for the past three weeks to see how Bec is doing. This upload put a smile on my face this morning @Eamon & Bec💪🏾👑🙏🏾💝💖💝
The dog is hilarious...love it!!
You're a Good Man, Eamon. Lots of Love to you both! Happy to see you back
foam is where the heat is? ;)
Words cannot describe the beauty in this video and I’m only half way through. Your community loves you both and we are thinking about you always ❤️
Love this and love that this house of yours have a piece of all your family and your love ones, because they all put their part in the renovations
17:48 and on was so sad. You guys are so strong.  I hope Bec is healthy very soon
Still keeping y’all in my thoughts daily and sending healing, happy vibes💛☀️
So happy to see a new vid, much love e and b
It’s crazy how much love you can have for 2 people you’ve never actually met. I thoroughly enjoy seeing everything you two are up to. Your journey and how you handle every challenge continues to inspire me greatly. You are both such beautiful souls, your energy radiates through the screen✨ I am so proud of both of you, and I am sending so many hugs, so much love, and lots of light your way 🤍🤍
Such joy when seeing you two posted a video! I thank you for posting! You bring such positivity to the world! Can’t wait to watch when my little one goes down for a nap! When he’s older he will for sure be watching eamon and bec videos with me😉
You literally “owe” us nothing. That said, thank you for your willingness to be vulnerable. The love you two have for each other brings me to tears and I can’t wait until you guys come out on the other side of this.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos.🎈
Bwahahahahahahaha Oso!!!
Oso is the perfect little ray of sunshine addition to the vlogs. Love his personality so much. Sending so much love to you both. 💞💞  Ps. How good was that spray foam Timelapse 🤤
Love that dog's attitude! You go Oso! What a dawg! Nice job on the renos!
Eamon you are a champ! The love you two have is so very special. Keep feeling the love. Both of you are surrounded! So happy to see you both again!!
Love you guys! Sending healing energies your way! ❤️
Eamon, you and Bec are two of the strongest, sweetest people on this planet! It’s all going to be okay. POSITIVE VIBES ALWAYS ❤️❤️❤️
You give away his couch then, his nuts and the cone of shame for two weeks. Poor OSO. Bec feeling and looking good today. The building inspector is going to want the railing bars min 4" spacing by code.
I did a flight tour around Ontario i was in a Cessna 172 we were about 15km from your area at 2,800ft i did weird wave as we flew over the lakes 😀
THAT TASTE LIKE YOUR DRINKING STRAIGHT UP BUBBLE GUM LIQUEFIED, I WISH I COULD DRINK IT BUT I CAN NOT!
We all have missed you !!! Sending love and light.
Your guys content make my day whenever I watch a video of yours!
I woke up this morning and knew I would see you guys today! Sending positive energy from B.C.
Large dog coneheads . . . the ultimate disruption tool. Not bad as a destruction tool either.
More life more blessings your way
OMG! OSO AND THE COUCH, too funny!
Prayers are yours each and every day. Stay focused on the end of chemo and the road to full recovery. YOU are Warriors!
We love and care about you both.
Beautiful Job!!! ❤️
Oso just made my day 🥰💙
Lol Oso is so attached to that couch, hilarious
Love you guys! Keep the vibe!
You guys are in my thoughts so much. So weird to feel so connected to you, when i’ve ‘only’ know you through your videos. You both carry this journey with so much grace, shine bright dear Bec and Eamon 💖
Don reminds me of Steve Martin lol
Nice to see you guys! 💗💗💗💗
Hello Bec and Eamom.  Happy Sunday.  Bec, I hope you are coming along, praying for you always.
Omg I missed you so much ♡♡♡ Sending you so much love, health and happiness ♡♡♡♡ I love you, thank you for excisting ♡♡♡ xx Rosa
I'm so excited to see you back! Can we have Eamon & Bec Peloton group rides? 💪🏽
Prayers for you and Bec! It’s hard to stay strong when faced with cancer, make sure to take time just for you. Your mind and body needs that! Love you guys and prayers for you both!
Oso must not have been consulted, about his couch going away. 😂 Good to see you guys!
Jeeeez Bec looks amazing. I don’t know of it’s just me or she has this new extra soothing tone in her voice…Thanks for the update and we love you guys…. 🇬🇭🥰
Been thinking of you both. Thank you for catching us up and showing how you feel.   Always love seeing your videos- all aspects including the projects. Oso is hilarious!!
Literally have been checking every Sunday for this post. Really missed you guys! So glad to hear that you both are well considering the circumstances. Bec, you got this! Keep kicking cancer’s butt! Eamon, remain strong, I understand your struggle. Sending love and support from The Bahamas. 💕🇧🇸
Sending you both so much love and strength!!! So thankful for both of you and the strength and joy that you all are still finding! Love love love!!!
One day at a time brother man...one day at a time.  Love to you both.
I know those “dark places” all too well. Doing much better though now that I’ve learned to tell myself, “on this day, in this moment, all is well.  And every day that we ALL wake up is a blessing.”  You both are in my prayers. You guys got this!
Only love to all of .....
If this YouTube thing doesn’t work out you have a great future in trades, Eamon 😂 Way to work through his crappy cold spring we’ve been having In eastern Ontario 👍
I've been reading a book called Dying to Be Me. I am not sick and no one close to me is sick either. But I look for positive energy every were I can. I didn't grow up with it nor and I'm surrounded by it concerning some close family members...but I've been learning to live in good energy for myself. I stumbled upon that book while searching for good words from other's stories. They usually always have something profound to say that hasn't crossed my mind yet. Maybe others can find some hope from it. Peace and happy healing whether it's mentally and/or physically. 💜☄️💜
Love you both but please can we talk about Oso? Could he be any more perfect? He’s the best mix of both your energies!
I am so impressed with you! Oso and that couch!!!!!😁🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣
Been thinking of ya’ll constantly. Sending endless love and light from Minneapolis, MN | USA. ❤️
I'm just starting to watch the video now but before I even do I know it's probably going to make me smile and cry... I think about you guys often and I'm so happy to see that you posted this week. I continue to pray for Bec and am amazed at her bravery to share this journey. I know the anniversary of Lee's passing must have been a difficult day too, I can't believe it's been a year 😢 💕 Stay strong 💪💗💪
Man I have missed you guys so much!! ❤️
I’m so excited for an eamon and bec cabin video that I might watch this twice 🥰🥰
💛
Osso 💝💝💝
Oh my goodness oso on the couch 😂😂😂
Eamon you are such an amazing man! Your doing a great job. Love you Both!  Nothing but love a support from Salt Lake city Utah 🥰❤🤗
In love <3
❤️❤️🙏🏽. You are amazing Eamon .. Bec is going to kick cancers ass!! Sending much love and support and continued prayers for you all!! Hugs 🤗
Yay!  You both have been on my  mind and prayers have been frequent that Bec can learn to Let Go and Let God.  This is still my mantra when ever I am feeling powerless against what ever. May you also feel the comfort that comes from our knowing of the Super Loving Power of our Creator.  Whether you believe or not, the Bright Shining Light of Spirit is in us and around us at all times.  Through balance, you have the Energy, as do we all to come out to the other side from the darkness of an illness.  May it BE so.
I’ve watched y’all for so long y’all feel like family and when I watch your videos I feel every emotion. I’m so proud of y’all and constantly praying for y’all.. y’all are awesome! Love y’all! ❤️

Omg so funny with Oso trying to get on the couch. Haha my husband and I have a red arm chair in our living room that needs to go to the dump, but our dog is in love with the chair so we can’t bring ourselves to get rid of it .  You guys are amazing. Keep healing and keep laughing!
All the best! So proud of you guys, Oso´s forever family 🥰! Toda la luz y energía desde el desierto de Atacama!
You are doing great Eamon and Bec is a strong woman. I know you will get through this. Sending you both hugs xx
I have been thinking about this since Bec's diagnosis. Maybe covid was a blessing in disguise...who knows if Bec and Eamon would have renovated this cabin if covid didn't happen. Now you have this beautiful oasis to call home during Bec's treatment. P.s Bec you are beautiful and we are all rooting for you! Thanks for the great video guys!
God I love you guys so much ❤️❤️❤️
Oh my gosh I'm so happy to see y'all 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽. Oh Bubba you made me cry. Been praying for your peace and strength Eamon; the raw vulnerability of seeing you express your feelings.... ok I'm gonna stop crying now.  I haven't forgotten you Ms. Becca...praying for your peace, strength and speedy recovery.  Virtual hugs all the way from Carrollton Texas ❤️❤️❤️
That dog is made for YouTube!
So happy to see you have a video posted but even happier to know your both doing well and keeping busy. 💖😃

Oh dear. Pmsl. Bless him! You can get a soft cone lol. Or an operation sleep suit thing ( looks like a baby grow) so that he can’t lick but doesn’t need a cone. Bless him what a funny puppy.
I been thinking about you guys. I just passed thru quimio and radiation and I understand how much you are going thru. Blessings
stay strong!!!!

OMG I have not laughed that hard in a while! Poor Oso needs a new couch LOL Big LOVE to you three, & your cast of cool dudes.. That is going to be such an amazing  space to have!  💗

Glad to see you again.  I understand a lot of what your going through. My wife had breast cancer at 30, so I get the mental process your both dealing with.  Best of wishes.  Eamon, just a suggestion.  Keep a secret stash of Bec’s favorite snacks/treats, to surprise her at unexpected times.
Thank you to each and every one of you for your continued support. We can feel the love and prayers from around the globe and they mean so much to us! Looking forward to brighter days ahead 🌞 All our love and gratitude back to you xx
