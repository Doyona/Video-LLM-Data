I remember living through that storm.
I would rather stay in a tent on pine island then in a Hurricane shelter
Oh my. That is so sad for the family to take in God help us ❤blessings
Several years later and we’re still working on getting back to normal.
Some people have animals, like cows, horses, even business supplies in storage at their residence. Can’t leave that!
Hurricanes are not going to stop forming and coming ashore in Florida. We are going to see more of these same scenes increasingly in the future. Rebuilding on the same barrier islands that are just barely above sea level means disasters like this will keep happening.
We used to find Pine Island when my father-in-law lived In Leesburg, FL. Wonderful drive over a saltwater marsh to a small, pay for the the day, beach on Gulf  of Mexico. Sorry to hear about the devestation from Hurricane Ian 😢❤️🐉💙💙🌈🌈😎😎
It will takes yearssss to fully rebuild..I live thru hurricane Andrew  in 92..it took 4 to 5 for everything  2 get to normal
We made it,we stayed and survived but after this hurricane I’m never staying again,this was my first and last hurricane,my kids got stronger mentality after seen all this but not taking the risk again,thanks for all the help we got from the outside 🙌🏽🫡
I was born and raised on pine island hurricane Ian was the worst hurricane I ever seen not staying on the island again when a hurricane comes people on pine island stick together we are strong the damage I seen on pine island made me cry
I moved just before
Epitome of the Bubble-Headed Bleached Blonde...
God bless them, sending my thoughts and prayers.
Yahweh judges amerikkka  Book No such thing is global warming 47 scriptures says yahweh controls the weather
I was telling a lady she should leave bf the storm hit. She and everyone she knew stayed. I don't think she made it cuz I haven't heard back from her since. Her name was Carmen Poole
Sadly we were warned that if anyone chose to stay after issuing a mandatory evacuation order that rescue & emergency services would not be available until conditions were safe for first responders to get out and do their job.
We had no help in vieques Puerto Rico, so I definitely understand. So 😢
I’m so thankful that my entire family and I evacuated two days before the hurricane hit. I had a gut feeling it was going. To be bad and was able to convince them to leave with me.
Awesome Story!!  We loved the Bridgewater Inn.   We stayed in one of the shanties across the street directly across from Bert's Bar.  We are so sad for everyone and so thankful for the memories.  Sending love and hope to all that were affected so badly by Ian.   We are in South Venice and had damage and many huge Live Oaks blow over.  Many fortunately missed homes.  We feel extremely lucky and plan to help anywhere we can in these hard hit communities.   Especially Matlacha.  Their resilience is inspiring.   Thank you for this amazing coverage.
I HOPE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD ISSUES WITH WHICH WAS MOST BECAUSE I WAS AN OUTSIDER I HOPE YOU'RE THE ONES THAT DIED I HOPE YOU'RE THE ONES WHO LOST IT ALL I'M SO DELIGHTED THAT THIS TOOK PLACE YOU GOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE
Hahaha to all pine Island residents you got exactly what you deserve you shun the outside world you treat us with such nastiness when we come into the island well now that you need our help we refuse to help you haha
NO ONE WILL COME TO PINE ISLAND TO HELP THESE RESIDENTS FOR THEY TREAT OUTSIDERS WITH SUCH DISRESPECT SUCH HATE SUCH NASTINESS NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY NO ONE COMES TO YOUR AID.  DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE COME TO PINE ISLAND AND EXPERIENCE THE YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE YOU'RE AN OUTSIDER THIS IS THE HILLBILLY WAY.  YOU ALL MADE YOUR BEDS NOW THEY'RE WET WITH MILDEW AND ALL KINDS OF DISEASE NO LAYING IT HILLBILLIES AND PLEASE LET THE DISEASE TAKE THE REST AWAY.  PINE ISLAND SO MANY NIGHTS SO MANY DAYS I LAY HERE HOPING PRAYING THAT THIS ISLAND WOULD DISAPPEAR IN HERE IT IS AND IT HAS HAPPENED FINALLY.  PINE ISLAND RESIDENCE ANNOUNCING TWICE ABOUT SHUNNING THE OUTSIDE WORLD NOW THAT YOU NEED HELP NO ONE COMES SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACT THE WAY YOU ACT.  PINE ISLAND RESIDENCE GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY DESERVE AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT YET BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE THE REMAINING OF WHAT GARBAGE LIES THERE OUT TO SEA.
REMEMBER ME THE GUY WITH THE PARROT THAT USED TO RIDE UP AND DOWN PINE ISLAND REMEMBER THE ONE YOU RAN OUT OF PINE ISLAND WITH YOUR IGNORANT HILLBILLY WAYS.  THERE'S A REASON WHY NO ONE IS COMING TO HELP PINE ISLAND YOU'RE HATEFUL IGNORANT CLOSE-MINDED BEYOND UNEDUCATED SO HILLBILLY IN FACT AND SO HATEFUL AND UNLOVING THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL HELP OTHERS IS TO BECOME DESPERATE SO DESPERATE IN FACT THAT STILL NO ONE COMES TO HELP YOU.  MOVING TO PINE ISLAND WAS ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCES I EVER WENT THROUGH TO PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP PINE ISLAND DON'T DESERVE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE HILLBILLY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.  THE AMOUNT OF HATEFUL ENERGY THAT YOU PROTRUDE TO OUTSIDERS CAME BACK TO GET YOU AND WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO DO SO.  I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM THAT YOU RAN ME OFF THE ISLAND WITH YOUR HILLBILLY WAYS YOU LOST IT ALL AND I DID NOT.  NO ONE WILL COME TO PINE ISLAND TO HELP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BETTER IGNORANT UNEDUCATED HATEFUL SELFISH CONNIVING BEYOND IGNORANT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO OUTSIDERS.  WHEN YOU PRESENT THIS TO OUTSIDERS WHY WOULD OUTSIDERS COME TO HELP YOU YOU GOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE AND I HOPE ALL THE RESIDENTS OF THIS ISLAND WERE KILLED AND IF YOU WEREN'T KILLED I HOPE YOU LOST EVERYTHING.  THANK GOD FOR PINE ISLAND BEING WIPED OFF THE MAP NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE WENT THROUGH.  I AM SO BEYOND DELIGHTED TO SEE THE DISASTER THAT TOOK PLACE HERE GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE HILLBILLY WAY OF IGNORANT STUPID BEYOND DUMBASS HILLBILLIES A PINE ISLAND YAY REMEMBER WHAT YOU PUT OUT YOU ALWAYS GET BACK AND THIS IS TRUE
I pray for those parents. So sad.
Those fruits and veggies that news lady spoke of , are gone , or ruined by the flood water, is she stupid, wow
Is that why they wont food or water to the island? Govt.wants the to leave?
I stayed for a direct hit from a cat 1 years ago and will NEVER hang around for a hurricane again in my life.
I will never understand why mandatory evacuation is ignored. It was SO obvious this would be the absolute worst hurricane...the next one will be worse, then the next.  Now is a great time to leave South Florida. Too risky, too expensive, too scary wondering...when's it gonna happen again.
Finally,    America's   Retribution!!
I think is time to ban mobile homes from coastal counties.  I know is a cheap retirement but they dont survive a Category 1 hurricane
sooo sad with this hurricane
People with medical situations are to evacuate well before the storm. They should know that during peak hurricane arrival that no first resonders can resond beacuse of downed trees and washed out roads. If you choose to stay, you are to have prepared supplies and sit tight till the next day. This statement has to be learned over and over again by people who just don't Listen!!!!!!!
Idiots for staying Lesson learned too late
They absolutely call tronpo for help since they all voted for him
To be perfectly fair Governor DeSantis warned everyone who stayed behind in evacuation zones to have two weeks of food and water, because you would likely be completely on your own for a long time after the storm. Don’t say you weren’t warned!
Personnaly I have little compassion for stupid people that build structures and live in Natural Desasters Areas that have a long history of destroying said structures as these weather patterns are known to occur repeatedly in cycles.   The only reasons people stay in these places is because of Government Desaster Relief that is paid for by everybodies taxation and the printing of money the Government doesn't have, while other programs are donations funded or by insurance the customer buys plans for living in these Natural Desaster Areas.  All this amounts to increasing prices of resources to rebuild structures in areas that at any time will again be destroyed by a furture Natural Desaster.  This is the definition of Insanity.
Foolish staying there!
The old man with the socks up to his knees doesn't look fazed by the hurricane.   I bet he stood outside during the hurricane and just started at it with his terminator glasses.
Oh, Lord. This is heart breaking.
Well, one thing is for sure the hurricane's are going to keep coming their not going to stop so I think I'd consider getting away from the coast
"Ship stores"???
Whoever developed Pine Island in the first place should be sued.  This is naturally a barrier island / mangrove swamp.  The fact that anyone lives there in the first place is the stupidest thing.
Can you imagine what would happen if EV mandates were in place? I think Florida should be the exception.
We need to repent and return to GOD our greater
The “independence factor” is not always sustainable! The pull yourself up by your own bootstraps is a false dichotomy.
USA should support those areas and not send billions of US dollars to Ukrainen war. It is totally stupid how USA acts. No help to locals but making wars outside USA.
I’m in Floridawe were hit, lost some power and a little damage , but not like this ,  my heart breaks for these people. So much devastation💔💔💔,It’s incredible how people come together in times of need.
I would love for this women to go and fish for her families dinner for one day... disgusting anchor...
The truth is politicians are corrupt. Businesses and the rich are too greedy. Too many of the poor (sad to say) are stupid.
After the looting started it became a complete warzone. Everything was destroyed and people were carrying ak-47s. Im glad I left when I did.
I got helicoptered out the friday after the hurricane. My dad stayed behind because of the looters, what we had left he wanted to protect due to the loss of law enforcement. Up until a few days ago recources have been completely absent, and the government hadnt planned on rebuildijg the bridge. The only reason we have a temporary bridge and plans to rebuild is because of the people who stayed behind to rebuild, like my dad at Stearns and Honc Industries. Islanders help Islanders.
I said this to many people that laughed at me when it was on Cuba : This Hurricane is coming and is a real direct hit  not no outer bands the real deal the structure of the hurricane , the people in the Islands if they don’t evacuate are going to die  they laughed again look at it I hope that number is low these where my FedEx customers in the past RIP 🙏🏽
Thank you!!!
Courage à tous ces gens ! 😢
I live in Port Charlotte near Harbour and I'm 40 min north Ft Meyers!! My town gas station are out of commission but we have 2 or 3 working but expect to literaly wait 6 hours in line for gas!! I'm now on fourth a tank but fear it will go on empty before my turn.  But I got power back on and I'm grateful for another day. All this looks bad but in due time come on down!!
After Katrina no one should have rebuilt here but f*** around and find out right build it right back only going to happen again and again
People still desire and dream of owning a waterfront properties. Let the people be happy how to spend their hard earned money. Life is too short to save. Live and let live, enjoy your retirement income, as long as you are happy!
Very foolish to build or buy in a very high risk zone . Go figure .
Well then the news reporter should have taken them …they got there and back to the main land
Prayers to this mother who lost her daughter. Prayers to all of Florida.
Having gone through Hurricane Erma I left and when I returned the thieves beat me to my property.   I wish that these thieving people could be shoot or arrested.  My heart goes out to them.
In our prayers
No one is forgotten...especially the indigenous Calusa of Pine Island.
No more governments.we dont need those parasites anymore.
Man those news reporters talk a lot of shit
What happens if they have a Medical emergency 🚨 😮🤦🏾‍♂️
My idea is that whoever gets this message is to get a large group of people together, maybe from the island to go through all that debris and pick out the good lumber and copper or anything that might be reused and repurposed to rebuild their homes and infrastructure. they need battery-powered tools and solar-powered portable power stations to recharge. they can live again. God Bless Everyone and peace be with you!
we all underestimated Ian, we are resourceful people and we know how to survive but the fact a cat 1 hurricane did so much damage to Orlando where I am from these people got the worst of it. pray send love and if you can help with money please do. Florida is made up of a different breed but I think as much as I love Florida I am ready to leave. I had my entire family in my home and it was a blessing that I am on a hill. I'm five minutes from lake eola and in my early 50s I live less than 10 minutes from the hospital I was born at I've been here in Orlando most of my life  I've never seen a cat 1 do this kind of damage. Global warming is real even if we make changes I fear it is to late. I have been watching storms all over I have been in the middle of many a storm but nothing like this. the creepiest thing was there was a sound during the storm that I had never heard before I can't even explain it the only way I can explain it is the sound that was being made when the cars were moving in the Jurassic Park movie when they got stuck on the trail in the cars with the little girl and boy the sound would come so often and I didn't know if we were going to survive we had to listen to that sound in the dark because unfortunately I bought 8 huge flashlights and tell me how only three worked and I didn't know how long the storm was going to come oh I had candles but you don't want to have candles going with little ones in the house you know, especially because of the fact that we all are in my hallway.   I cannot express enough how blessed we are I cannot express enough that the only thing that took a hit was my pool the survivor's guilt is real and the loss is devastating. Ian literally is the beginning of a new breed of storms mark my words.

Members of The Satanic Temple including myself are on your side, Florida.  We'll be helping out residents not with thoughts and prayers but instead financially, with food and water and clothing, caring for pets that were left behind, and anything else we can do to support you.  Hang in there, everyone, you'll get through this.
Appreciate this video!! Would love more of the Monroe canal Sanibel blvd side all the way to the bay.
Ian supportet by Geoengineering done by your own gouverment.
Small ting plenty more to come they did worst than that to other countries absolutely no reason to feel sorry for.tske it as it come with a smile
Small ting iraq was worse than that when they finished bomb them
Prayers for the families!  I lived thru Hurricane Hugo in ‘89 in the Virgin Islands with winds clocked at over 200 mph.  Sounded like a freight train!  Lost my roof and electricity for over 2 months.  I feel your pain.  Take it one day at a time.  You are resilient.❤️
Seems like the poorest areas get the least amount of help. It’s not right!
There should be NO houses on that island!
can't you get her to mainland?
All that rubble needs to be buried  3 stories down all around each island  n get ready for the next one they have to have Solis sea walls and 3 story  sea walls on top of those to be on any coast
Luke 12:20 “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?”  John 20:31 31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.  Repent of your sins, give your lives to Jesus our Lord and Savior while there is still breath in your lungs! And be saved from eternal hell and damnation Through the blood of Jesus confess with thy mouth that Jesus is Lord and that He died for your sins and rose again on the third day all praise and glory be to Jesus! ❤️🙏🏽🛐
Oh my heart just breaks 😢😢😢. Her poor baby! Praying for all the poor victims in this awful devastation.
The lady news reporter says the people there can fish for food and gather fruits from the trees..........wow, would love to see her there for a week without any resources!!
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Stop whining. Survival is going to take-on a whole new meaning in the near future (actually... that "future" is now). There were/are a plethora of resources to track a storm and MAKE YOUR OWN EDUCATED DECISIONS!! Anyone with an IQ above 50 would not have stayed on the West Side. Since when do people elect to place their lives in the hands of government -- the same authorities so many complain about? If you stayed behind, YOU are responsible.
They need a help some latín peoples. The white peoples muy rasist.
✝️ Eternal Father I offer the the most precious blood of thy Son Jesus in Union with all the masses being said all over the world this day for the souls and purgatory🔥especially those who perished in this hurricane💐🆘 St Gertrude the Great saw a vast number of souls leaving purgatory entering heaven who pray for us who pray for them ✝️Read Me Or Rue It 📘 Chapter 5 🇻🇦
I can't believe they chose to stay.
Great coverage!
is there a Go Fund Me page for pine island?  if yes, please post details.
your coverage of Pine Island is deep in compassion and appreciated … God’s speed.. ❤
It's no problem admitting when you need help but the three news reporters are trying to play up Blue collar hard-working self-efficient people when a natural disaster just hit the smartest people are the ones who are not trying to be tough
Let me tell you y'all don't know until it happens to you. People don't want to leave everything they own even though they may not have much left, it's all they have. 😢 😥
Hugs
Plenty of prayers 🙏 ❤ to all of Florida and anyone who went through hurricane 🌀 Ian or has any destruction from hurricane 🌀 Ian. Praying 🙏 y'all get the resources that y'all are in dire need of.
Karma is!!!
Huh?? They can fish for their own food and they have fruit and vegetables growing all around?? Maybe the fishing, but they may not have means of cooking it. For the fruit and veg trees/plants, if they're not in cans, then they are out of luck lady.
BULLSHIT! I’m boots on the ground! It doesn’t look like this !!
Praying 🙏 for more help to come 🙏,  help is coming 🙏 ❤️
Excellent reporting sir!
Matlatcha...you are included with my comment below ❤️!
Our Jersey  Strong ❤️s are praying for you! Give PINE ISLAND the resources they need...and they will do it right! 🙏 to you...we hear your story and feel your  ❤️S!
Desantis said no to the offer of the Illinois Nat’l Gaurd the ones w lots of helicopters then voted no for FEMA aid along w Scott Rubio and Gaetz. Traitors to the people of this state.
If the people want to stay, why the county want them out.  The government can supply water and transportation by ferry.
Seriously?  How can we leave a whole inhabited island right next to the mainland to fend for itself?!  To tell them to find their own way off the island?  It’s just nuts.  I came here because of a story I saw on the Weather Channel about it.  It sure explains a lot about our response to distant Puerto Rico if we can’t even properly attend to Pine Island.
Noe are the utility companies going to be responsible for weather and catastrophe proof infrastructure?  Is zoning going to change like it did in California after the earthquakes?  My aunt’s 1950s cement brick house was the only one able to withstand Micheal in six blocks of wood houses. Clue guys.
🙏🙏🙏❤
They shouldn't have been living there. These islands are "barriers" now  crying and taxpayers will foot bill pathetic.. Need to stop developing !!
I am a Pine Island Resident stuck off island with my home out there destroyed. We are pine island strong and we survive. Thank you for seeing that. You guys are THE FIRST new channel to make a solid and meaningful story. That may be because it's difficult and that I understand. But you made it happen and for that I thank you. PINE ISLAND STRONG!!!!!!✊️✊️💪💪WE WONT BE FORGOTTEN
Where is then National Guard? Until then, Pine Islanders will do for their own.
They want to stay to try and save their homes.
Hurricane's happen, let mother nature have it back.
I am sorry for daughter's passing. 🥺🥺
America is the proudest and arrogant country of all countries, and it is not only that, it is also the seat of Satan. Her people do not want to fear or obey God because of their arrogance. God is always angry with her. The blood of many innocent and righteous people is in her hand. May God have mercy on her. This event is not an ordinary event, God is helping you to repent from your evil deeds and sins. The choice is still in your hands, you have to choose either death or life. If you return to God, His mercy will never end, and you will be saved, and you will be saved not only from this danger, but also from eternal judgment. Now return to God who created you before it is too late. Jesus Christ will come soon and take only those who belong to him and will return. Then those who do not believe in him and live a sinful life, even those who  worship Satan (666) will be punished in eternal fire (hell) from eternity to eternity. You will live with the Lord forever and see his face. So please, I am concerned about you, sister, return to the Lord, the incident will stop and pray for the whole world. Everything will pass away, but he who does the will of the Lord will live forever!! This meassage is from ETHIOPIA
As heartbreaking as this story is I just can't understand why anyone living in a costal area when a Cat 4 storm is heading your way would stay? I can't wrap my head around this. What were these people thinking?
Recorded horizontally:)
The life is no party time all word from the beginning
Praise the lord o he people of the world Jesus is hear come to Jesus Praise the lord 🙌
We must find a solution to stop Chemtrails... Haarp... Cern... Nasa... who destroy the weather and the Earth.
Welcome to  Genesis 15:13-13 and GET THE HELL OFF THE LAND!!!!!!!
NBC you lie! Pine island is being evacuated by ferry.  They are NOT being ignored!  When are you going to start telling your listeners the truth?
This is very sad but people were warned to leave but disregarded the warnings from the professionals! There are over 80 people who would not have died if they would have evacuated!
Myra 8 namber 2 myna huwa dytanahi do doller dynyka nteja dyko ab dyko keta hani huwa   Dyko my shbko joge  bnawga paka grnti
Omg 💔💔💔
Sad
Has anyone on Pine Island heard of Samaritan.s Purse? Perhaps they can offer some help as they are coming to Fort Myers. I am in Canada, but have a home in Forest Park NFM, so my heart is with eveyone in this disaster.
Clean up these islands and do not re-develop them. Leave them in their natural state.
People should not be allowed to live on these islands! If you stayed, stop begging for help! Your to tough to leave, remember! Those boats should have been moved! I have compassion for people but it's hard to feel compassion when they where told to leave! They should be removed from these islands permanently!
Where in the hell is the guard?oh they were ordered to UK no one helping gov doesn't care about us jut the border crossings edits. Cone in phf the draft on get the military build up what a give get diwn there abdHELP😧
So heartbreaking
Great true story..book title-"Cowboy Mafia "🌿(Amazon).
Żal mi tylko przyrody reszta chuj.
Yes, any deaths are tragic and were completely preventable.   Too bad we still can't predict hurricanes and they had no warning. If only anyone, anyone could have predicted the severity of the storm and told them to evacuate in time..
All countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia will be punished by fire and water, this is from the earth from God. The United States is an international terrorist, the whole world suffers from them. Undermining gas pipes in the EU, the supply of weapons and kil lers to Ukraine. Des truction of Ukraine, grav es of the Ukrainian people. The murders of Slavic people. A complete lie. Let's pray people let the light pierce this darkness and everyone will see the real kil ler and thief.	Все страны кто ввел санкции против России .Будут наказаны огнем и водой,это от земли от Бога. США это международный теро рист от них страдает весь мир. Подрыв газовых труб на территории ЕС,поставки вооружения и убийц на Украину .Уничтожение украины, мог илизацация украинского народа. Убий ство славянских людей. Сплошное вранье. Помолимся люди пусть свет пронзит эту тьму и все увидят настоящего уби йцу и во ра
We have reached the end of man’s life on earth. Denial will not halt the inevitable. Only Love will take us home. ❤
Well gee you made it back to the studio🤔 PERHAPS USE YOUR STATION HELICOPTER TO GET HER LIKE THEY GOT YOU!!!!
You can thank your people like Matt Gaetz Marko Rubio for voting NO FOR AID FOR FLORIDA ALL BECAUSE ITS A POLITICAL THING INSTEAD OF WHATS BEST FOR FOLKS IN FLORIDA.  PRAYING FOR YOU FOLKS IN PINE ISLAND SANIBEL FT MEYERS AND ALL THE AREAS HIT SO HARD.
I would not rebuild again that close to the coastline, most of us from Mexico Beach left & never went back
Sad sad sad😢😢God bless this peple
First, all have been offered a way off,some are staying to ward off looters.
I lived in Bokeelia for about five or six months back in 1984, my first year out of college. I wasn't there long enough to really get to know people or stay in touch before I moved to Georgia, but I am nonetheless just heartsick for the residents of Pine Island.
A Category 4 155mph coming directly at you and you didn’t Evacuate and your living on a Island, Come on man! I was given 3 notices of mandatory evacuation in North Port before the hurricane. If you don’t evacuate you are on your own… That’s the way it is. Another thing I bet that entire island is a very high risk flood zone and any rebuild will have to be 14 foot above ground and still have to have flood insurance.
Was wondering where the water from the gulf went did you see it its all gone. That is strange its like someone took the sea and dump it in florida we need to look into this.
...............YET Y'ALL KEEP MOVING BACK THERE 🤔
God bless that mother. 😥
By far the best news report I've seen so far from any source. A mature, informed, humble reporter in the trenches giving a sober account of the reality he's observing. This is the way news should be done. No more kids fresh out of journalism school hyperventilating over waving palm fronds, puddles in the parking lot, and a bent stop sign. Give us more Evan Dean please!
I just spent the last 3 hours helping fuel those buses, they were all covered in sand inside. This is Sunday night.
💔💔💔 R.I.P as a mom myself that was gut wrenching…
NBC2 News - Thank you for this report...Can you please ask for a list of supplies these people need...2. The Coast Guard can helicopter in and with a bullhorn, ask all those that want to leave the island to come out & be rescued.  I would ask your sister stations that were not affected to reach out to the public for help. After Hurricane Andrew, we had a "Neighbors helping Neighbors" we took supplies to local Fire Stations, which then were lifted out to various Communities in despair. Newscasters not only report the news, but "Take Action" to do what it takes to help those in distress. Problem is that many people are without power, water, or cell phone reception, and will not hear your story....You have the Resources to go beyond reporting the news...So sit down, brainstorm how you can help start a "Drive"....It will take many months for Matlache to be livable again..  And watch the weather guys...more to come....I was in the Cape for Ian...It will not be healthy for those people to stay on the island with those conditions....for sanitary/ mental health/ just plain health reasons...🙏🙏🙏🙏
Ummm they even though self sufficient, There is nothing, Nothing left. No clean water, no bathrooms, the fruit trees as you say they have are dead from the salt water!!! Help them! Send a drone to drop messages to them, get creative, you cant leave them stranded with NO means like that😰😢😭
It so sad my heart go to all those people who are affected
People were given 5 days to evacuate. It's a shame that people refuse to evacuate when transport and resources and time were made available. It was known that a 15'-20' storm surge was due.  Tragic for sure however it is good advice going forward to evacuate when advised to do so.
Sending payers and positive vibes to our friends to the south,.
Hardy people that didn't listen!
Going to visit the ocean is awesome. Having the ocean come visit you, not so much.   Thoughts and prayers for all those affected by this horrific storm.
What about all of these boats going back in forth taking video??? They can't help ferry the residents??? Seriously? What is DeSantis doing for the lower income residents??
Never defy the weather professionals thinking you know better. Always always always evacuate. Protecting material things is never worth your life 😢
I dont see any pine trees.
To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. And may peace and calmness fill your life.❤please click my name if you need more of this❤
SO VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS  SUSAN SENDING LOVE AND PRAYERS FROM CT XOXO
I live by an active volcano - I'll take my chances - because IF it should erupt in my lifetime, it'll only be once. How is anyone surprised that a hurricane came and did what it did? EVERY 3 years, on average, Florida gets hit by a hurricane (remember Andrew, Irma, Betsy, etc.).
WHAT A TRAGEDY FOR SURE! MY HEARTS GO OUT TO EVERYONE..I live in Ct and was looking to move to Orange county or Lee county in the Spring..I am now rethinking this decission..MY QUESTTION>>>> how do you even clean up after something like this? Where does all the wood and furniture go?  What about the cement? What is done with it? what do they do with all the boats? my mind is boggled! thank you and God Bless everyone including all the rescuers xo
How do expect the  U.S to help these needy nice U.S citizens  when they need to send billions of $$$ to a corrupt Ukrainian government in a war they shouldn't be involved it.
She needs to email Desantis maybe he can help get resources there. Good luck girl!
How do they get a star link Wi-Fi?  Hundreds a month?
That poor mom!!!!!  Look!!! folks...... Winter really isn't that bad......move up north!!!  Just make a few visits to Florida or the coast!
Im sorry hold on.... The reporter obviously made it to and from Pine Island, those parents could obvioulsy go with the reporter.  I would not rest until I got to my daughter, specially seeing reporters come and go...obviously there is  way so what is this reporter talking about, hopefully they made it to Cape Coral? its infuriating! Ive seen CNN and Fox reporters connect stranded people to the mainland
Find old water heaters and use water in them that are still able to be found in the debris this should be clean and uncontaminated.
Distill water by using a Tea Pot, Pressure Cooker, or makeshift pot, attach a garden hose (cut) to the pot spout of hole or hole that you make, put in water salt water, muddy water, contaminated water, cook on any dry wood outdoors, BBQ, and steam the unclean water, salt water, or mix into another pot or container.  This will remove salt and help clean water, then use charcoal from a BBQ, or wood that you burn like in a fireplace or just create, and use to filter other tastes or parasites, but the distiller will make fresh water from salt, you can filter more.
Welp they did learn a lesson which is head a warning
My heartfelt sympthyto all those people hit by ian.
Just inquiring.  Do low income and minorities follow mandatory evacuation orders or do they just live by their own set of rules?
start being a decent socitey and all this misery wil stop !god is punishing americans and its only gonna get worse start loving instead of hating!
It’s easy to say “evacuate the island” but where the hell are these people going to go? So many of them are long time residents. Praying for resources to get to the people. 🙏
So sorry for the family that lost their daughter, how much pain is in this storm!   We have friends who sstayed and finally were airlifted by the coast guard, (post Ian)  but it was avoidable because their son, begged them to evacuate.  It is hard for elders, they are in their 80s and hard to muster up the same energy and drive as a younger person might.  Resilience,  yes, but when you are young and agile, to fish, climb trees to get fruits ( really after the foliage is gone?).....FRESH WATER to drink seems to be the biggest challenge though that everyone seems to be missing.  Surrounded by water that is generally not drinkable is torturous.  We will see that it will take a lot of time to get things rebuilt and infrastructure to be in place.  Please everyone, donate something to places like American Red Cross, Team Rubicon. At this time, american airlines is offering miles if people will simply donate something.  Be safe and prayers for all in the coming months.
❤❤😢 praying.
Don't dwell on an island anymore!
So
If people were able (understand some can't), they should have evacuated before the hurricane.  There was a 1-week warning.
Climate change is real😭
well let them dumb asses stay in that swamp and drown
They're community isn't forgotten about. It doesn't exist any longer. 🤷‍♂️
Time to leave pine island and figure your next move. Unless you have your own boat to make the trips back and forth to civilization yourself. I'm doubtful if they stay and live there that it will be any time soon the government  builds one or two families a bridge.
😰
Take everyone off the island and plow the debris under. Never to be built on again.
Great Ohana❣️🙏🏼
Heartbreaking but strong people.
It was supposed to hit Tampa then Sarasota then Charlotte County then Lee County it kept changing by the time people found out where it was going to hit it was too late to leave you can't blame them
Unbelievably Devastated!!
I visited Sanibel when a ferry was the only way…Bailey’s store had basic needs. This was 1955+
Where is there a map or list of injured and fatalities.??
OOOH😪 GOSH 💔💔💔💔💧
"They can fish for their own food"  WTF  ??????
Isaiah 13:14

Where's the donations from the ultra spoiled and greedy traitors the Trump kuschners?! ...They sold out our spies getting them jailed and killed, stole and sold our top secrets to the Saudis for 2 Billion, hacked our utilities and pentagon.....and still profiteering by pushing the devil himself as a new Jesus, insulting the religious globe, yet not a single donation ever for anything or anyone. Just raping, stealing, trafficking, money laundering, Bank and tax fraud and getting a million Americans killed with the covid that they intentionally spread.
🇵🇱 APOKALIPSA !!!.
You-as a human are no match for Mother Nature. If you choose to stay-you pay. Sorry.
OK some under built shacks failed and some people stayed even with plenty of notice so ...clean up and rebuild better because Hurricanes are 1,000 years or more old for  Florida and we all get out turn .
We will all help there's nothing else we can do but give help if you're nearby please do what it takes. Is glasses are so hard to handle.
That was the finger print of the climate change.
Prayer for these survivors .
Meanwhile, illegal immigrants are put up in luxury hotels and luxury liners. How many hotels are reserved for Ian 'immigrants'. Answer 00. where is FEMA?
Navy has med ships use them.  Also use aircraft carrier for supplies and the sea bees ect to help rebuild
People on an island should never ride it out when a cat4 hurricane is coming.
the anti Big government crowd in FL will now be standing with hands out for US taxpayers to rebuild their homes and replace their boats. no pulling themselves up by their by their bootstraps but sucking at the tit of Big Government. screw them!
Take the boat. Blessing for a speedy recovery.  Are hearts with you all.
Very sad 😔
EVACUATE
This "news",as they call it,is all lies. Show the real news,,butt,,,,they,,,never,,,will,,only  what they want u too see,,"WORLD",AS"THEYthe"DEVIL""WOE IS UNTO THEE".........JESUES CHRIST IS LORD".
I'm sorry for them, truly heartbreaking. Why did they NOT evacuate per the order?  These barrier islands have always been so vulnerable forever.   May God bless them and give them peace that only He can give.
whes didnt they leave?
And it's just the beginning of the last time. Many people refused God's Law. Vatican's pope still bow down and speak to statues :) of Fatima, instead of praying to Lord Jesus Christ. As he sacrificed Ukraine & Russia to her, that's why it doesn't help. And he still teach to celebrate Sunday 1st day of the week, instead of Sabbath 7th day according to Law of God. That's why we have got all these issues. So we all need to repent & go back to the true worship of God.
Thank you for this coverage. I lived in Bokeelia and opened my first bookstore in Matlacha. I have often thought of moving back. That no longer seems an option. My heart breaks.
My heart is just breaking for this mother who lost her daughter. Such a tragedy on all accounts. My thoughts and prayers are with all of you.  I wish I could do more.
Thank you for every reporter that has gone to the people.
Lord please help the people in pine island 🙏🏾❤️⚡️✨⭐️💫☀️
Good news for the stranded people on Pine Island.
My mother in law lives on the beach in Hawaii..everyone ignores tsunami warnings and it scares me that they do this.
Fish for food?  Vegetables and fruits in the trees?  What the hell is she talking about?  "They can skin alligators and make boots" - dumb reporter
lives in wood stick trailer, doesn't evacuate, shocked it gets destroyed
Should people be allowed to rebuild on these barrier islands?
*TO ALL THE JEEBUS FREAKS IN THE COMMENT SECTION, STOP SAYING GAWD BLESS!! THE SAME GAWD THAT ALLOW THE HURRICANE TO HIT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!* 🙄🙄🙄
It is unconstitutional to force Americans to leave their house. If they stay they know the possible outcomes.
I remember the warning to evacuate. I think everyone got that message. if they chose to stay they can't expect to be rescued on demand.
There is a local construction company offering to pave a gravel road into Matlacha. I understand they are waiting to hear from DeSantis
Just to remind everyone DESANTIS and GOP VOTED AGAINST Hurricane Sandy relief bills for the victims!! They said Hurricane only affected Blue States!!
veľká sila, je mi to lúto.
When the hurricane hit Cuba, Florida was WARNED and advised to evacuate. And the warning said expect loss of life. And the warning came from more than one source,
Visited Pine Island this past summer and loved the community feel there. Prayers for the people during this recovery.
"I'm moving to Florida!" -"They do get hit with hurricanes ever year" "Oh don't worry nothing is going to happen to me" 😂😆😆😂😆😂
Man we love Kelly Peter and all the NBC2 Crew  ❤!
UPDATE: I was able to get in touch with a family member and Susan & Jim DID make it off Pine Island.   “We have been safely evacuated by Coast Guard to Cape Coral. Staying with friends who have a generator,” is the message sent to me by their family.
Rubio, Scott, and DeSantis suddenly lobbying for compassion ... (When you tempt fate - you invite KARMA).
So sad
Excuses,excuses,excuses…. Your car is a hotel…with wheels…police will understand if asked why your here. Have Identification and now your surroundings….. Just sad….
Praying
I mean like what did y’all expect
Self sufficient? Are they going to rebuild the road, run the helicopters, etc? Or are those of us who choose to live in reasonable places going to foot the bill?
They were told to evacuate. As a born and raised Floridian, and a Hurricane Charley survivor, I have no pity on those who decided to stay. Come on ego, get over yourself.
Maybe people shouldn’t live there? And definitely don’t stay for a hurricane. There were warnings to evacuate and that 911 wouldn’t be available for days. Just get in your car and go somewhere safe. Floridians seem to keep their heads in the sand.
My heart goes to that lady who  lost her daughter  hope she manages to get to her . Prayers to everyone  and safety.
Boca Raton, the land of the most arrogant and entitled residents, especially, the females, deserve a storm like this. They need to get a lesson this hard to learn to humble down.
They use boats everyday in Venice.
Reminds me of the game Dead Island.. Eerie. When people tell you to leave, don't stay and ride out a storm in a mobile home..
I don't care how tough you think you are but if you live on a barrier Island and a cat 5 with 12+ feet of storm surge is headed your way, YOU NEED TO GET THE F OUT!
BIDEN - RESCUE THESE PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM TEMPORARY HOUSING AND FOOD ON CRUISE SHIPS. NYC IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IT WITH ILLEGAL ALIENS.
OK, so these people didn't evacuate, and now they're cut off.  Being there during the storm wasn't going to magically prevent your house from being torn to pieces by cat 4 winds and an 18-foot storm surge. Sorry to say it. What people also need to think about is that Norwigien Cruise lines is considering a deal with with Mayor Adams of New York City to use ships to house illegal aliens until a more permanent solution can be achieved. Why isn't Biden stepping in and doing this for these poor trapped blue-collar american Floridians? The Biden administration is actually loving this crisis. They want it to get worse before it gets better in an attempt to give DeSantis a black eye.  He and his cronies are happy this happened to Florida because it throws a real wrench in DeSantis's potential 2024 bid.
My sister's home is on Pine Island and so far she has been unable to get there. She would at least like to see what her damages might be.
I have heard from a friend , that there is a lot of violence and looting.
Je n'es jamais vu quelques choses de telles pauvre personnes qui sont touchés part ce désastre 😱😢😢❤️
That's this too big government today!  They just turn off 911!.
guess moving to an island that is hit by hurricane was not a good idea and I ant going to bail you out it is not paradise after all
I am perplexed why people didn’t leave after they were told it’s a mandatory evacuation!!!
Now at least they may get help from the coast guard or military to bring supplies
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Can't believe anyone would stay on Sanibel or pine island during a storm .
Thoughts to all residents of Florida in your time of need.  Shout out to friends in the Ft Myers/Naples area and to my Spring Break hangouts Bonita Springs Cigars and World Famous Cigar Bar, hope you are all safe.
Is it is worth it living in coastal cities in Florida? It takes one hurricane to destroy many years of build up.  Absolutely not worth living there. The whole state is at risk with global warming brewing!  I am thinking about getting the hell out of FL,!!!!!!!
Never underestimate the forces of nature and never overestimate your own ability.  Be aware of your situation and always leave yourself an out.  I have found myself in desperate times just like these people and had no one to blame but myself.  Please, God, never again!
Most people in this situation are unrealistic right now because they are in denial until they have to except that this is the reality😢 and this horrific storm has changed everything for them that will take years and years before it’s some what normal again. 💔
Some places you only vacay, not stay stay.
U can’t fight God
Black mold will take over this place unless it’s buried in the sand and dirt 😷
my heart breaks for the parents and loved ones who lost their love ones.  I think independent people should stay on the island and rebuild it. it's not like it's their first rodeo facing a hurricane. most shelters = charge people to stay. too many greedy people claim they help the homeless.
STOP...Sending our money overseas to help other countries... Our own American people need the money and the help.
The saddest part is in the modern world we're so caught up in the just world bias that some people will be like  it's their fault for living in such a dangerous place.   That they should have known better.  Like they cannot process that  bad things sometimes happen to perfectly decent people.
Thank you SO MUCH for this news piece. Especially the question "How can we help?!"  We want to go back to Pine Island!
Perplexity. REPENT.
Indiana national guard was turned away!
Please keep up the coverage on these places.
I can’t wait to see this in a year from now…. and let’s see who stayed and who decided to leave….. it may never be rebuilt if they don’t have the resources
Why do people think they can take on a major storm?🤦🏾‍♀️.. they are only human...
This comes as a lesson when they tell you in a hurricane to get your booty out of there you get your booty out of there this is not a snowstorm this will make you swim and you will die
The way they're talking about the poor people is so condescending.
My Mom is on Pine Island (St James City) and I have not heard from her since the 27th.
Is there a reason that these folks didn't evacuate?  The warnings ahead of time made it sound like this was going to be a very deadly storm.
Prayers for Pine Island.
what do you mean people have no where to go? just evacuate and head north and go inland and stay at a motel for a few days. mitrks are all over the place. be smart and safe and don't wait it out putting yourself in danger.
When someone commits suicide I feel bad for those left behind. But I consider the person who took their own life as disturbed,selfish and not worthy of the precious and unique gift of life. Given the state of humanity today I would bet the majority of those "victims" could have walked themselves  somewhere hurricane seawater was not a life threatening thing. Too much technology, people willing to help and government pre storm assistance. I'll say it for these unwilling to. Those who had a choice where stupid or suicidal.
Evacuate next time ⚓️
If anyone's in the area of Englewood gas is in Nokomis if you need it and across from shell on Indiana Ave is the coast guards set up. Food/water/supplies.
We vacationed in Matlache 4 years ago and fell in love with it! What a charming place. I wonder how Blue Dog Grill and The Perfect Cup fared? It's heart breaking to see the devastation there.
It was a beautiful, memorable run, “the fishiest town in the world”
I live off the island near by the coast guards across my street and they are helping them today thankfully
Hooray for the creative and determined people on the islands. Just get them off and on to go to the store and dont be so judgemental. Just because of what you would or wouldnt do, man there in the middle, does not mean that is what they would do. They are obviously go getters who love their town.
Godspeed to all island residents. The political influences and wealth of Sanibel , a former Mayor of Sanibel now a county commissioner, will ensure that they get resources first while Pine Island and Matlacha take a back seat in remediation.
Thank you so much for doing this story! My parents have had a place there for many years. They are a resilient community for sure.
They keep saying "They're incredibly self sufficient! They have boats! They'll fish for food!".  No gas for those boat motors, guys.
Why did that insensitive prick use the word 'dead' in referring to that poor womans daughter. you couldve used a different word desides 'dead', you jerk off with the cap. you idiots on nbc need to take sensitivity classes.
Starlink Wi-Fi’s are provided by the state with the help of SpaceX.
My prayers are with these people.
you guys are god damn nightcrawlers
Fruits and vegetables?! Are you out of your mind?! There are barely leaves left on trees let alone fruits and vegetables 😮
The problem with people in trailer parks in a hurricane zone is IQ.
JUST SHOW OLD POSTED NEWS FEED AND YOU CALL IT REPORTING  YOU SUCK
They live on   Sand bar and didn't  leave, these people ...  hard to feel,bad for  them when they knew ,  they stayed,   Lucky to be alive
News guy says "they're incredibly self sufficient and independent".  Meanwhile every resident on camera saying "Why isn't somebody coming to help me FASTER".  Bit of a disconnect.
Tear down the entire island, turn it into a state park.the insurance company’s will do this because they will never insure the homes again
To anyone asking why people didn’t evacuate, think of this…We have a lot of old people here. Many are infirm with medical issues and cannot just pack up and go somewhere easily. My heart goes out to these people.
Homes built on sand Wash away
This is heart wrenching. God be with all these people. Completely devastating.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😇😇😇❣️❣️❣️❣️
Why would you stay?
We handled  Katrina and we can handle this
Real people, telling real stories on fake news NBC how did that happen?
Please people, if they tell you to evacuate, do it!  Possessions can be replaced, lives can’t.  I understand that you want to protect your property, but you aren’t stronger than the storm. Personal safety must come first. My heart goes out to you.
Disney Universal and the cruise ships could step up and help thousands of people??? They would be funded later $$$ shame on them opening the next day $$$$
And that's the reason why they gave you rides and did all that stuff is because they want their story out, go down there and not be the press and you'll see the true colors I'll be we don't want to print the true colors we don't want to do that we don't want the true colors of people to actually be seen oh wait a minute this was a hurricane so of course everybody's going to be changed for a little while and then there are true colors will set in again
Woman makes strange assumption. There is no fruit or vegetable that survived the storm.
My son is there in Cape Coral which is mostly dried out now.  That is in Lee County.  Gov. DeSantis is pissed because other parts of the state that were hit are 45 percent up with electricity.  And Lee County is only 9 percent up with electricity.  He is offering everything to the power company and they just can't seem to get it together.  God Bless these people, and help them all.  It was scary we were visiting, and my son lives there.  We both had to evacuate to the Atlantic Side before Ian hit.  Now he is picking up the pieces.  He is strong and will be ok, he has been helping others and others helping him.  He said everyone is coming together.  He feels worst for those who lost everything and have no where to go.  It is just awful.
Pine Island resident' desire to remain independent should be honored.  How about people with boats bringing them resources like tents, food, water, gas.  The shelters aren't a great solution either.
Yes and this is also common sense if you have medical issues even though you want to live by the ocean don't this is the reason why because you have hurricanes you have flooding etc them and their daughter and everybody like them brought that upon themselves so I don't particularly care to see crying and upset and all we lost everything and you know no you made that choice you made that choice and now you're homeless so you really need to suck it up and be homeless like the rest of us and I want people to treat you all that are newly homeless people like the rest of us homeless people who have been homeless for years I want people to treat you all like us
You know I feel sorry for everybody that went through the hurricane however I cannot sympathize with them nor will I, for the simple reason they made the choice to live on an island they have made the choice to live in hurricane territory which is also flood territory they know this they were given warnings they did not heed the warnings so all I can do is feel sorry for them but on the other hand they brought it on themselves, the oceans are rising this is going to happen all the time eventually it's all going to be underwater and what are we going to say they're homeless and they are homeless but I'm also homeless however I have enough common sense not to live on an island where there is hurricanes flooding etc but I want to see if people treat these new homeless people the way they treat the rest of the homeless people who have been homeless for years,? Are they going to be treated different because they were on an island and they lost their home and everything I want these homeless people to be treated the same way everybody treats the rest of us homeless people who have been homeless for years who have been struggling to get back on our feet and being treated like s***,
I am very sorry that these people have lost everything they owned and that they are living entire circumstances but that's what you sign up for when you live on a tiny Island on the Gulf Coast that is only accessed by a very long road / bridge through swamp. You need to be self-sufficient if that's how you want to live. You cannot expect the government to just pop right in and make things right for you
Decades of cocaine and human trafficking on those waters that gave you life now brings you death 😅
Omg 😢 please get these people Satellite phones boats to get them off the island come on it’s gotta be some billionaire out there that can help these people
Damn my heart hurts for the lady that lost her daughter. I wanted to hug her.
Why would you stay on an Island, when you knew a hurricane was coming? If you have no place to go. Why would you not go to the mainland for a proper shelter?
They told you to EVACUATE,  WHY WOULD YOU RISK YOUR LIFE? NO COMMON SENSE, NONE......
Riding out a cat 4 on an island. Why?
Who's going to move all the debris?  Where are they going to put it all ? How cool they are self sufficient  . They can find their own food ! Good luck .
Bonjour. Ici nous avons des nuages et pa de pluie sud de france
Good.
God Bless them
I hope they get though this. Praying for all of them
Prayers for Pine Island. Thank you for bringing this story to our hearts.
These people on Pine Is. IMO have the greatest need for help.  Obviously, everyone who has suffered from this needs help, but those who are year-round residents, who work for a living, should not be pushed aside or sent to the back of the line so that the wealthy communities, winter home communities, and tourist areas can be taken care of first.  Those places with 'name recognition' will get the most attention, but there are so many others who are in the same desperate need of help - they should not be forgotten.
My heart breaks for that mother & father, praying they made it back to see their daughter, rip
So sad. But according to the VP Harris, Equity is at the forefront of Hurricane Ian victims.
Thank you for focusing on Pine Island. 🙏
Welll Biden said he had all had national guards ready to deploy there. And all this resources..ready to deploy. And this was before the hurricane hit.. those folks say they ain't seen nobody.. dammm sadd. 💯
Why the US Navy amphibious ships like the Wessex are not deployed in Florida to assist?  If there is this stupid law that the Navy, Army or Airforce cannot operate on US soil, then temporarily transfer the vessels and personnel to the Coast Guard.
Apparently this is the 1st hurricane ever. No wonder these people were surprised. Imagine buying a house in a place that not ever been known for hurricanes and one day out of the blue.  Wham!
These people are told time and time again to EVACUATE on major storms.  They decide for whatever reasons, not to.  Then want to play the total victim when they get stuck in situations like this due to their very POOR life decisions they make.  Im sorry your child is dead and you can not get to her but people like you are told time and time again about these storms and yet, do what YOU want, then want everyone else to come in and fix YOUR mistake for you.  Don't blame the county, Don't blame the government because YOU decided to stay.  You are old enough, you have seen enough hurricanes that you KNOW they are NOT predictable and when one as big as the entire state is coming, it's gong to cause major damage EVERYWHERE in 100 miles of the eye.  There are plenty of public shelters too, you can't claim I got nowhere to go.  You rolled the dice, this time you got caught.  The saddest part of this all is, two years from now, if another huge hurricane comes in again, these same people are going to stay again, and once again play the kicked puppy act when they get in a bad situation, they never seem to learn.   My parents were the same stupid way with Charlie, they paid for it.  Nature does not give a flying Fk about your pride.
If you were under an evacuation and didn’t leave, sorry you deal with it. Why would you stay, you should of went to a shelter. But be stupid and stay and then complain there are no resources.
Why couldn’t the news crew take that couple off the island with them? 🤷🏻‍♀️
That's all of the footage you have?   The people need to see more of the island so that they can see what shape their homes, family, or friends are in, rather than just the same 15 seconds re-played over and over.  Stop patting yourself on the back and show more.  Your videos may be the only way for people to get information...even if you have to cut out a few commercials to give it more airtime.
Why isn't Trump touring the disaster? LoL
HAARP Storms
If I had a boat I would be out there helping. If you’re able to help and you’re just watching please help instead. There are no fruits and veg left come on. Get on your boats and go help ppl!
yeah right they will be independent till they get sick from that ocean with the chemicals and random toxic waste runout. and no sanitation we will see.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, heed the evacuation orders. This is heartbreaking!!!
They stayed often because they had no options. They don’t have the funds to go elsewhere.
U guys now learn your lesson. Look how many times they told you all to move from there,to evacuate. U all were being selfish because there are other ppl who desperately needed help and u all choose to stay there. Now other ppl have to risk their lives to save you all.
It would cost less to buy out everyone and turn the barrier islands into national parks. The concept of selling building permits for people to put residences out there seems heartless to me.
So sad, God Bless everyone. ❤️🙏❤️
love & prayers from Indonesia
capitalists understand the opportunities to exploit and prosper. a true capitalist is like a vulture that circles above when an animal dies. be prepared to have your bones picked clean. only the strong should survive in america. only the rich
its sad that another hurricane hit i remember taking a trip to tybee island georgia and i think it was back in 2018 or 2019 that a hurricane hit for the first time i heard of
I live in Ireland. People moaning like little bitches about bad weather. Feel so bad for these ppl. Yes they've got some great unreal great  weather but when the bad stuff hits, it hits hard. Hope they'll pull through.
I hope all recover from this storm as soon as possible 🙏 sorry for everyone who has lost something or someone.
Praying to God that us govt both federal and state will help people to the best of capacity
My grandparents used to live on Matlacha until the combo of rising taxes and flood insurance was too much for pensioners and moved to Cape Coral before passing in 2017.  My great grandmother lived in St James City until she passed about 12 years ago.  Seeing those places since the 1970s were wonderful memories of the FL fishing village past that mostly remained up to the early 2000s.  Matlacha in particular had added a quaint art district by the mid 2010s, reminded me of Sedona AZ art district.    Hard to see the devastation from Ian, and prayers and donations to the FL disaster fund are the least I can offer.
why do people when there's a hurricane. my self while in fl. i got to ahead of time and made sure i had food and medical supplies
Oh Lord, the tragedies are endless.😢
Feel bad..love pine island ..were pepole not told to leave before storm..
Regarding Pine Island they knew what was happening and chose to stay. They shouldn't be whining
I wish there could be something to be done
How do we donate directly to these residents?
Come to California but hide your jewelry
Guys? How about dropping this cliche and greeting viewers, well, as viewers?
Thank you for covering Pine Island. Often forgotten since it isn't a multi million dollar island like Captiva.
And the season is just starting..very scary
Pray
Why do people ignore the evacuation warnings and stay?
These poor people who stayed got what they deserved.  They were told to leave, but NO, they knew better.  I have been, as a 70 year old costal North Carolina resident, told to leave and I have stayed thru a bunch of hurricanes at Wrightsville Beach NC and Topsail Island NC. You stay…you don’t complain.
Houses made of boards ... Now a lot of forests have to be destroyed to rebuild it ...
Get those people out of there!  Call the Coast Guard, Navy get the people out of there now!!
These are the same people these climate specialists are the ones Who sent everybody from Tampa evacuating to Sarasota Lee County these idiots told people to go south out of Tampa. Climate specialist climate change crux. Yeah let’s send everybody into the eye of the storm y’all have blood on your hands
Caribbean inhabitants know the risks of what they’re most susceptible to. Same with those who live near fracture zones, active volcanoes, coastlines, or in a places with names as literal as “Tornado Alley.” It’s people’s choices to live in these places that are more likely to be affected by nature’s wrath, so an acceptable lifestyle in these places is understanding the fact that the destruction, rebuilding, and maintenance of infrastructure IS the lifestyle.
Tell you’re going back to your little communities they have boats… They had boats
BOATS... ttey have BOATS. No they don’t you idiots the hurricane destroyed all the boats
Using sand as fill under asphalt likely is the main reason for the failure of the roads , bridges.    Sand easily liquifies and washes out.
Why did this guy not give them a ride off , he got off the island ?
Oh DEAR
Omgosh poor lady she can't get to see her daughter 😢 that she is dead because of the roads  😢 so sad my sincere condolences 😢 RIP prayers for her 🙏
Why didn't folks heed the warnings from the weather service. Its not like these folks didn't have time to leave. They clearly have the money to leave. If it was too inconvenient to leave before the storm but you could have and didn't. Guess what your a self made victim.
Who ever the reporter on the left is…is the reason I stopped watching NBC news.  Go fish for your own food and pick your own fruit after a Cat 4 goes over your home
Mercy...
Sorry but why did you not leave , you were told to leave
Some ppl are just tooo PIG!! HEADED!! they hv first responders risking their lives for no good reason ...to save their pig headed asses!! Stay! there then.
I don’t get why people stay knowing a killer hurricane is coming! Just no sense!!
I am so deeply sorry to all that were impacted by this monstrous storm. Those poor parents that lost their daughter. So heartbreaking🙏🙏🙏
Welcome to paradise
What’s DeSantis doing about this? If it was Venezuelan immigrants seeking refuge in the US, Ron would be running one of his political stunts. But he’s too busy to help Floridians.
Repent and Pray for this nation! Turn back to God!
THIS IS so sad because they was told to evacuate.
And all our money are going to the corrupted Ukraine instead of Florida. It is a crime!
Let them “pay through the nose” for assistance!
They need water dropped off in matalacha. There are many people shuttling people off and supplies on.
Should have evacuated, but people are stubborn and ignorant so now they have to deal with the ramifications of their decisions.
Why do these people stay through a hurricane when they are aware of the danger????? So sorry for their loss.
These people are fortunate to be alive. They should have evacuated but like so many knew better. Rather than pander to their demands for outside assistance, reporters should be asking why they didn’t evacuate. There are higher priorities for assistance than those who probably hate government and refuse to listen to those who try to limit death by asking people to act rationally. Those who want to let them stay. I’m tired of hearing “resilience” no it’s stupidity.
Weren’t these people told to leave these areas?
I have inside contact with people on the island still. I am from there. I can help.
That's chilling. I'm in north ft Myers with no water no power I'm filthy and all my clothes are dirty and I had to throw away everything in my fridge but I'm lucky to be alive.
Hope the reporter help this couple.
I live and stayed on pine island. The lack of help, info or anything is beyond absurd.
BUT  the houses are not made for windy day let alone hurricane  - why they didn't leave?????
Ppl live like this everyday on other countries
Take a luggage and go to the main land  Never look back. Hospital first Pharmacy Food industry First responders vehicles CONTAMINATED.

You'll be ok...it happened in America...and there's alot of white ppl...unlike Katrina
Cut off from the world...God u guys are desperate
This place looks unlivable. You can go get food or even water but you have no waste facilities no running water no electric the chances of your house if it's remaining being stable I would have to question. I can't even imagine what that decision would feel like to leave. Man FEMA better have a lot of trailers setup. This is what you call a true disaster because it's not just a few areas. It's a lot of areas that need a lot of help.
I have been trying to find out more of Pine Island, Matlacha, St James City and Bookeelia. Thank you for the coverage. Wonderful people, My prayers for them.
How many times do u get wiped out before you move to a safer place that's why they call them floridiots
Thinking of the people and prayers for them.
Thank you for the touching story of Pine Island. My sister and her husband are on the island.
Anybody know Jim Richie, Is a friend of mine on the island.
One word...EVACUATION ! If you STAY , be prepared to PAY ! Sniveling after refusing to evacuate is not a PLAN !
Refreshing, honest coverage. Rare these days.
Blessings, be safe be healthy God bless 🙏🇧🇧🤗🥰💫💕💖❤️
Hopefully Florida's governor will order the national guard to asst the people of Pine island immediately? Also my deepest condolences to the parent's of the young women who lost her life to hurricane Ian. I wish them well
🗝️THE KEY TO YOUR SALVATION 💙🙏 1Corinthians 15: Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 💙For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:💙 Confess, repent, believe & trust that King Jesus died, paid for your sins, and was raised by God on the 3rd day! May God be with you! God loves you, Jesus loves you 🧡 God Bless!!
The saddest part is that insurance companies will deny most of these ppl's claims but approve claims for millionaire's properties. And Desantis will give insurance companies $2B more for them to raise everybody's insurance costs.
If we can help house anyone or bring food, water and clothes please tell us how to do that. I have the time and resources. I'm in Jacksonville Beach florida.  If anyone knows how I can help these ppl please let me know, I can drive down there anytime.
REAL NEWS. NOT NOT HYPE, NOT FAKE. GREAT JOB!
This guy is giving instructions  to the people of that island on how to evacuate as if they can watch T.V.
No offense, but it was a stupid idea to "ride it out"

Oh my goodness as soon as that woman started talking about her daughter and how her daughter was gone and passed away I just started sobbing uncontrollably. I feel her pain through her voice and I just can't even fathom how much she's going through her and her husband... oh my goodness Thank you so much for giving these people a voice and helping them not feel forgotten.
AHORA ES CUANDO DEBEN BUSCAR DE DIOS Y SU INFINITA MISERICORDIA,,,, NUESTRO CORAZÓN ESTÁ CON U.S.A. AQUÍ NOS HA TOCADO VER ACABADOS PUEBLOS ENTEROS EN LA COSTA POR INUNDACIONES DE LOS RÍOS, DURANTE MUCHOS AÑOS,,,,,SABEMOS DE DESASTRES NATURALES, LO IMPORTANTE ES LA UNIDAD Y SOLIDARIDAD ENTRE LOS MISMOS HERMANOS NORTEAMERICANOS, PORQUE NO PODEMOS AYUDAR DESDE AQUÍ,  ABRAZOS COLOMBIANOS
The news helicopter probably could help by dropping flyers with details for those who want to evacuate. And the government should send bottled waters and food supplies to those who wants to stay. They probably wants to help with cleaning efforts.
My ex moved to Pine Island three months ago. Bought a house (mobile home) in a 55 and over park. She is able to work remotely. Fortunately, she had to go to headquarters in the Mid-Atlantic the week of the hurricane, but now has no idea about her house.
Horrible stories - such devastation🙏
I also wonder about the other islands farther out like Cabbage Key. Are people helping them?
I live there. I'm off island now . there are some stilt homes that are still quite livable if you have water, a mini propane stove, spam and a fishing pole. You can also shoot pigs and iguana.  we lived in ohio off grid, it aint that big a deal
no ship stores now - all blown away. Pine Island needs a Cajun Navy to help transport people on and off the island and bring supplies. Why can't FEMA or LCSO airlift water and supplies? The feds were much more responsive after Charley but the bridge wasn't washed out. There's tons of helicopters flying around - load up a Chinook with food, fuel, and water for these folks.
Time to move,head to Martha's desantis is there, go to Disney and beg forgiveness. Why the hell these people special...they had a chance to leave..fools
WOW   Could SOMEONE tell these reporters that there is a difference between Matlacha Fl.,,,, and Pine Island Fl.  they are showing One pic of Capt Cons at the tip of Pine Island,,that is GROUND 0 Bokeelia,,,,and where is the footage of ST.James and Bokeelia?  Matlacha is Unbelievably Horrible but PLEASE  know the difference! before you report!
God doesn't like ugly!
If they are able to stay home I would , bad enough damage by Ian but then looters come in which is more heartbreaking
The problem is, there's so many places that need such urgent assistance, and there's such a limited way to get people off the island and supplies on it, not to mention limited manpower
No aid for FL or SC….send them your thoughts and prayers instead. See how far that takes those MAGAts.
“We’re just being forgotten about here”……A major hurricane has just slammed into your state and you think that you are being forgotten about??? I hate to judge people but, you chose to stay on an island when a hurricane was headed your way.
where is the National Guard?
terrible...shouldve evaculated tho.  aid needs to come to Florida now
Wait a minute, isn't this reporter back on the mainland after talking to them?  You know, it starts with one!
So heartbroken.   Worked out there over a decade.  Love all those people.  Good hardworking families.  God Bless them
Why were the emergency services turned off. Why wasn't her daughter able to get help!?!?
There's no excuses for not giving help to these people whether they choose to stay there or not!!
Before bridges, ferries were their form of transportation on those barrier islands.
You’re not forgotten. Our prayers and thoughts are with you all. We love Matlacha and are in the area daily. We can’t can’t get to you and have had zero communication with the outside world till now. Hope help arrives quickly. Personally will be there to help when we can. Blessings from Naples❤️
People, please listen to the emergency warnings when they tell you to evacuate. Especially if you have a medical situation. I live in Florida and if I lived in any of the places along the water that were told to evacuate, without hesitation, I would be calling and looking for a place to go. There are many places to go to protect yourself. They broadcast it regularly there would be no help after the hurricane started. As harsh as this sounds, it is selfish to risk the lives of first responders when you could have evacuated before hand. To think your tough enough to weather out a 150 mph Hurricane is naive.
Year after year the hurricanes come, but those home are not hurricane proofed at all. Not even an attempt???
Plz next time everyone has to evacuate!! Nothing is more important than b safe .Sorry for all ur lost 😞
Why would anybody stay at an island 🏝 where a major huricane was predicated to hit with CAT 4 force ?
when are they gonna report in pa bc its pouring rain at 7:00am on october 2, 2022 n rain is still coming down!!
proves how small we are compared to mother nature
Great coverage
We do need to remember everybody.. No one came through this without horrendous impact….
reporters are such idiots.....
Hhhhhhh Nice hhhh
If you have 24 notice to evacuate and your already been prepared to travel inland say 20 miles,then why are so many in staying in danger...those that stay should have 30 days if generator,food,water,boat,medicine,cclorhing,communications..in water tight containers ,bolted to solid foundation...
Maybe they should call Trump to help them. 😂
This is heartbreaking! I couldn’t even imagine.
No one is forgotten, people are being rescued from Pine Island and Sanabel, and as of Friday and Saturday they are shuttling people back and forth from the islands to get to there homes. This was a historic storm the county responded as soon as it was humanly possible. If you don’t want to leave Pine Island its unsafe, and not reasonable to expect resources when the road is out… Get to the main land shelter, which the state has dozens open, with food and water…
NBC can't shell out money to help their own reporters get their reports done unless an islander lends a hand? Hahahahaha 😂
Sad and and even with an enduring legacy of human determination to maintain island life how probable is it with climate change?
Well...... Living on an ISLAND  that is pretty flat WHAT DO YA EXPECT? It is a nice place to visit but, you should not live there.  hope you had insurance.....
Great coverage  - succinct and  informative
At least it's warm, when I endured Hurricane Sandy it was freezing that was really hard without heat!!!
My heart goes out to yoi al watching from trinidad
This is so devastating
"They can fish for their own food," says the idiot dingbat news announcer at 4:32. and the fresh fruit is still hanging on the trees after 100+mph winds. Yeah, no problem and you can eat the fish raw. Better than sushi but wait!!! Lots of destroyed wooden homes for fuel if you want to have a beach barbeque. These fools are beyond belief. They must take stupid pills each day before going to the studio to show how dumb they are. She is a prime example of why these nincompoops should always stick to reading the teleprompter and not try to think for themselves. Something these morons are clearly incapable of doing.
MATLACHA STRONG !    THANK YOU EVAN.
Im so sorry for your suffering. Please seek help in God, who alone can save us. This sinful, broken world is coming to an end, but there is hope for a future in God through His Son, our only Savior, the Lord Yeshua Messiah of Nazareth (Jesus Christ), who died for our sins. The Bible teaches that judgment is coming to the world because man has forgotten God and does not seek Him. Please read the Bible and pray to God for His mercy and help because man is living in great sin....abortion, sexual sins, lying, stealing, cheating, pride and greed. Man was created to serve God in holiness and goodness, to love God and love others. Seek salvation. I pray for your healing and recovery. God bless.
OMG! HELP HER!!
May God Bless everyone.
The break in the road
Watching the, destruction wrought on these communities I am saddened . However I would like to suggest so e enterprising person's go into lumber recuperation and recycling business.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 prayers to these folks❤️❤️
Wiped out... WHOA... I would of left then came back...it's like your playing roulette with death when the Storm is that powerful...so much energy.... leave then come back....
I’m sorry but she had plenty of time to get to her why would anyone stay knowing a category three or four hurricane was coming in it makes me mad to think they’ve done this to themselves. And then people like Joy on the view wants to blame the governor.
Like there's any further on trees there. Smh. Nothings left on trees . Hope they have insurance.
No los rescataron antes de llegar el ciclón
The only reason bush senior found out homestead was devistated after Andrew in 1990 was Becuase a reporter told him. Down here   your largely on your own right after one of these.
I still don't understand people don't know what a mandatory evacuation is there was a order two days it even hit they all had time
If? You feel Florida is part of the United States ..just   go through one of these things ..and you'll ...lloll...see for yourself.
Medical issues daughter should have left. What a shame.
Good evening from lndonesia, l pray for the people in pine island, Florida, Caroline. Be patient.
Prayers
praying 🙏🏼
Im So freakin hungry
This is going to get worse PLEASE PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE ANY WAY AT ALLLLL, MOVE!!! I SOLD MY BEACH HOUSE IN 2013! IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRESTIGE! AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE BEACH💥💥💥💥 MOVE MOVE MOVE  I live in a cottage in the woods now... On a big hill... Never floods... Make sense, if you can do it, move 💥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is now the time to open our minds the real challenges a wake the whole world climate change,we cannot identify why this happened #
The reason they refuse to leave is because they know they're facing homelessness. It's either stay on this small island or face the unfacable. May God's peace and protection remain with them.
Biden will abandon you. Wait and see.
Dear heavenly father destroy them and all their possessions like they did Our ancestors Amen
Just a bunch of houses built on coastal wetlands. There is evidence of prehistoric sea creatures being the washed ashore in events like these. It’s not uncommon for fossils to be found.  Just a bunch of crazies over the last few hundred years; running natives off of their fishing grounds and building houses soon to become garbage dumps. What you’re witnessing is a result of habitat destruction.    Build inland and the coastline protects from these natural occurrences; build on the coastline and these natural occurrences become “DISASTERS”.  100 years of a real estate scam, more than an opinion.. it’s an educated one.
Repent USA ✝️✝️✝️ from new Zealand island s 🏝️ accept Jesus as your lord and saviour and be saved in Jesus mighty name amen hallelujah praise the lord ❤️🌍
So sad I've been praying for all
Heartbreaking.
These Sunday-morning, armchair, judgemental hurricane commenters are an ugly, heartless bunch.
Don't feel sorry for those people. They knew this was coming for over a year. Israel said, "Pay your rent or gtfo!" The Matlacha community said, "F. the guy that owns Matlacha. He can't do anything about it at this point." Then Israel destroyed it with a hurricane.
This was a really informative report.👌 Will be interesting to see how Pine Island is doing after a year.
pathetic coverage. there's a ton of source material online showing actual hurricane and they're interviwing some peasants about what they saw
Its weird that the News reporters changed the narrative to "they have fruit and can fish" after the storm has tossed around cars, trees, and the entire road 🛣️ is destroyed 🤦🏿💥
While DeSantis and Rubio sheltering in Mar-a-Lago, celebrating with champagne and lobster how much money Biden will send to Florida to help floridans however will be spent for Republicans campaigns. Thoughts and prayers for those who loss their lifes.
Unbelievable the arrogance of humans who think they can outwit mother nature. I'll never understand why a Cat 4 hurricane was thought of as a basic thunderstorm. How could you not evacuate if given the ability to. For the love of all that is sacred STOP building your homes in a seriously prone hurricane areas. Im so sorry for all the lose of life it was horrible and TOTALLY avoidable if warnings had been heeded. Godspeed.  I surely hope the ones that need the help get the help quickly and arent made to suffer more
Great job getting the real news out to us!
Shouldn't those people have evacuated that area?  If they did stay, shouldn't they have prepared?  Living in Florida most people know that you have to have food, water, gas etc to survive at least 3 days.  You can't expect help immediately in a major disaster.
Can’t get supplies at a ship store if their all blown away 🤔it won’t last your talking years if not a decade to fix this mess. I don’t think it will ever come back to what it was people will move
You reporters are snobs.
biden should leave global climate change alone
Расскажите, птицы, времечко пришло, что планета наша -хрупкое стекло, чистые берёзы, реки и поля-сверху все  это 🇷🇺нежнее хрусталя. Неужели мы услышим со всех сторон, хрустальный звон, прощальный звон!?!
This sounds stupid ... How are the survivers going to know this escape route off the island?? Is someone going there PERSONALLY to let them know ?? Because they don't have electricity to see the news. Idk this sounds fishy like trying to make it seem like they are helping these ppl but actually NOT.
I pray for all the people in Florida to be strong 💪 u will be able to. Real build and make Florida. Beautiful 🤩 again
It took all the beaches no more beautiful 🤩 beaches
I wish my brother and his wife would come back it will be safer I do miss them so much 😢I want them to be safe 😢
Hmmm island. Just like what desantis did to those migrants
It’s not Florida anymore there’s nothing left I guess people are going to move out because they are getting to many storms it destroyed so many 🏡 boats 🚣‍♀️ and 🚗 people don’t have the money 💰 to. Fix it up
O those dear parents my heart goes out to them
I dont know why anyone would stay on a barrier island during a almost Cat 5 its like common sense isnt common
My brother lives on Pine Island, he's still there and doesn't want to leave his home. says he's fine with his generator and beer
May your life be filled with  serenity, and good news. May God bless you abundantly mani bhai - Lahore District, Punjab, Pakistan
It is Mother Earth stating she has had enough of the gluttony of humans! She is not done yet!!!! Mother Earth is saying enough is enough and will come back bigger and stronger!!! No one seems to understand the destruction we have done!!!!!!
of the dozens of reports i've seen, this was _by far_ the most well done: sincere, direct, and real upon a pure foundation of humanity.  my mom is less than 25 miles from this island, but the devastation here is 5-10 times greater.
А пока деньги идут на украину, Флорида в большой заднице Почему вы не выходите на митинги??? Ваши деньги, ваши налоги идут в карманы зеленскому и его шайки
It’s WAY to many rich people in the world not even thinking about helping these folks . Smh
🌬🌪🏚🍃🌬🌪🏚🍃🌬🌪🏚🍃🌬🌪🏚🍃🌬🌪 WTF Lady...,Of course they "SHUT OFF" EMERGENCY SERVICES!....Why Do people Who MAKE the Ridiculous CHOICE ""NOT""to EVACUATE when they are clearly told by the City to EVACUATE, then "EXPECT" people to RISK their OWN LIVES to Go HELP THEM? I'm just WONDERING cause for me personally I would NEVER make such a STUPID & SELFISH decision!  Listen, You were Told to LEAVEEEEEEEEEEE & you made the CONSCIOUS decision to STAYYYYYY, Unfortunately the choices you make HAVE CONSEQUENCES. Seriously, Please explain to me WHY someone would RISK THEIR OWN LIVES just because you're IGNORANT/SELFISH & felt like 'RIDING THIS ONE OUT'...?  👀🧠💨Also, I'm guessing this Mother & her daughter were previously Aware that she had 'Medical Problems'. Isint that even more Reason to Go PICK UP your ILL DAUGHTER & make sure she isint LEFT IN HARMS WAY!  💡Dont be IDIOTS & Please have better Common Sense. Obviously Common Sense isint Common enough these days..
Where is pine Island?
The warning came too late
fuck man i wasn't expecting that lady to say her daughter was gone. ripped my heart to shreds
Thank you for this story, no one is talking about this amazing little community! 🙏
How did y’all get there and back? Can you take them some food and water? I highly doubt there’s any fruit on the trees and just how are they supposed to fish??????
Please think about your comments before you hit that send button.  Prayers for all.
There’s adequate time to evacuate when a storm is coming
Project cirrus the government admits to manipulating hurricanes 🌀 😑 🙄 they want you off the coast
Prayers from Houston. We made it thru Ike & Harvey it sucked but its amazing how people come together. Hopefully these communities can get the help they need.
My parents owned a vacant lot on pine island some years ago.   They sold it later on.
Thousands will flee and never return
why did they stay? they were warned, and now the rescue services are all tied up rescueing them.
We were in Orlando at the time the hurricane came through and I had to unsubscribe to all kinds of Disney YouTubers claiming that they made it through the hurricane and they were staying at Disney hotels…. Wake up people.    What came through Disney was NOTHING compared to this.    I hope everyone can recover and people find peace who lost someone and lost everything.
All these fake news stations are heartless,cold and indifferent to the plight of Floridians.       They love casualties and it shows.
Collision course with an unavoidable fatal blow. My home state I love and live in now for 38 yrs is dismantled in so many parts. Our beautiful coastlines battered and destroyed by mother natures brutal force.
Motor homes should not be near the ocean. Houses need to be build more sturdy to hold a huracan and when the government tell you to evacuate do it.
We said the same thing in Hurricane Hugo never ever stay
😭 Love swfl  Been fishing on pine island since 2000 Praying 🙏 for lee county
Is Cap'n Rons ok???
Lol, Ron Burgundy here cracks me up.
My heart is breaking for that mother. Omg I can't imagine. We all need to come together as a community and help
Mind you these are the same people that laughed at people from Hurricane Katrina
For those who are staying on the island is there a way people on the main land can help? With maybe supplies, food,  water blankets anything? Or a place to start a donation center?
But they gave grave warning to evacuate 73 hrs ahead of storm but people stayed and road it out and now complaining there stuck 🤔
Why do these people stay get in your 🚗 leave
Too bad Desanty is against providing aid..
Prayers for Sudan and her husband ❤
Why people don't move out in a 🌪 call ? Why why? I just don't understand it.  Life is more important than anything else. You can always  came back  but not from dead.
Didn't any of these people learn anything from hurricane Andrew? They stayed and thought they'd ride it out. What fools. Stupid people always learn the hard way. That storm wasn't nearly as strong as Andrew. All they had to do was leave and drive east to a shelter on the east side of Florida.  Plus, why should the tax payer pay for these stupid people. They should never have been living on these low lying islands to begin with. That area of Florida is fill of shacks and trailers that are not appropriate housing. It should not be rebuilt. All the shacks and trailers should be removed. A other hurricane is in their future.
Lol.  The news lady thinks it’s Swiss Family Robinson.
Never underestimate a persons resolve. I played Everquest for years with a guy who lived in Maine.  Saw him every day for nearly a decade for a few mins or a whole day. One day he posts he's not going to play for a while and I figured a while would be a week. He was gone for 4 years. When he gets on for the first time after going missing I ask how he has been and what he has been up too. He told me there was a storm and it washed several feet of mud over his property. He grew his own food and harvested the trees to build his own house so having everything you own buried under feet of mud was devastating. I never did ask for clarification on what several feet of mud is, but knowing him it could have been 9. What this man did was dig out his entire property by hand and rebuild by hand. I asked him why he didn't just rebuild on top of the mud and he told me it was not going to support plants, but the land under it would.. so he dug. I asked if he used a tractor or other equipment and he said he did it all with a wheelbarrow and several shovels. When the ground wasn't frozen he was digging it out. When the ground was frozen he was building a house. When people have their minds set to a task and it's a true resolve there is nothing that can stop them.
Amazing how people that can afford to won’t evacuate, if they knew a tornado 🌪️ was going to hit their house tomorrow would they still stay? Of course not, I’m sorry for they’re lost.
Help has been on the island for awhile. Don’t be so dramatic.
There is nothing left there won't be for years time to move to the Mainland
wow ... If there were any minorities affected by this storm all across the state of Florida, we will never know, because non of the news reports thus far have covered any of their stories of survivor
Just keep it all in perspective… these places are inhabited by the wealthy.  The majority have insurance and vote like climate change is a hoax. They all are still humans.  Help out if you can.
As someone who was born & raised on Pine Island. He spoke the truth about how Strong the people are there.
Government creates these Hurricaines. How do they name them every year? and they know when they are going to happen.
That must be so devastating, seeing your home completely destroyed.
I really appreciate this coverage of regular folks.  I feel more like contributing to working people than to millionaires.
How come no one is mentioning Captiva?  They havent had access since like Charly(maybe?) when their bridge causeway blew out. Then only access has been boat and plane for years.
I suppose the world leaders will have another meeting which does absolutely nothing to address of the effects  climate disaster while texas puts a ban on abortions the planet continues to fall apart a better use of resources would be directed at immediate climate action now  you would think that the country would focus on this necessary change what good is a car if its floating by what good are fancy houses if they are flooded without power what good is having children if they all drown or are shot at school tying to understand the states but they make 0 sense cars cause green house gas emissions which caused the climate crisis we need to stop producing fosel fuel now or it will get so much worse science doesn't lie politicians do
These people Must not watch coverage of other Hurricanes like Ida and what it Did to Grand isle,Golden  Meadow,Cut Off and Houma.Some people just won’t ever learn until it happens to them unfortunately. Secure all your Toys and get the Heck out of there!!!
ThT never leaves you as a mother to help you child esp if they call on you, so no matter how old even if her daughter was 55 that is still Her Baby. :( And mother still has that need to want to help, resuce or go get their child esp if they r in danger.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️
Why didn’t these people evacuate? Everyone knew how bad this storm would be? Why did they stay?
Why don't they just temporarily airdropping military tents like they would in setting up a temporary base give them the same benefit I mean we give military items away to our supposed enemies you think immediately we would be putting them in the hands of our citizens who are in trouble the ones that don't want to leave then air drop them tents in there get them the things that I need that can be done overnight outside the box thinking folks
If the area is to be rebuilt,Dome Homes are very strong
‼️🆘️WEATHER WAR FAIR 🆘️ ‼️PLEASE WAKE UP
Thing is SW Florida was basically a time bomb waiting to go off. If you look at National Storm Surge Risk Maps you will see any sizeable hurricane will destroy that area miles inland. It's basically a combination of swamp and shallow Gulf of Mexico that causes such a bad storm surge. This same storm hitting Fort Lauderdale would have a fraction of the flooding because of the geography on the east coast of Florida is not as dangerous for hurricanes(though still dangerous obviously)
Prayers
Why didnt they evacuate?
It is the poorest, the oldest, the disabled, the ill/injured, and those without a family safety net who NEED the most help.   It is never the wealthiest, beachfront properties who've purchased FEMA insurance, and who have multiple homes and multiple bank accounts at multiple banks because one bank can't insure it all with the FDIC.   FOCUS ON THE MOST VULNERABLE....THAT IS WHERE YOU MAKE THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE.   This is true in EVERY disaster. THE MOST VULNERABLE NEED YOUR HELP.
🙏praying for healing and restoration on all who have been affected by hurricane Ian - in Jesus name✝ amen🙏  For such a time as this, it's time to be looking  ^UP^  "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" {Titus 2:13 ] +++===+++===+++ Did you know Jesus said: "Ye MUST be born again."? Have you been born again?    Jesus said: “Marvel not that I said unto thee,  Ye MUST be born again.” - John 3:7  How does one get born again?   Believe on Jesus Christ.   Christ shed his blood for all our sins; past, present, & future.     Believe Jesus died for our sins and that he was buried  and rose to life again on the 3rd day;  according to the scriptures of prophecy.  This is the Gospel, this is the good news as written in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Believe this and the Holy Spirit will come into you and give a new birth to your old spirit.   Your spirit will be reborn or "born again"  Jesus lives now and if you ask Him to into your heart, your spirit will be reborn and the Holy Spirit will fill your heart.  Ask Jesus to show you He is real; read the Holy Bible; read the King James Bible.    Read the book of John chapters 1 thru 3 first.  Jesus is the Word and His Word is True.    John 1:1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."  Read the Book of Romans.   Romans 10:9-10 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. [10] For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."  Read the book of Ephesians  Ephesians 2:8-9 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
I really appreciate hearing this report. So much of the reporting I've watched has been focused on the damage to property, infrastructure, etc. It's good to hear reporting about the people and what they're going through; so many people adversely impacted by this storm! Take care of the people first then take care of the property.
Praying for you!
Thanks for your compassion and article and helping people to know the situation so more help can come to the people of Pine Island.  Many years ago I lived in Matlacha and my heart breaks.
просто помойка стала помойкой БОГ наказал потоком за северные потоки за диверсию. Карма бумеранг
When you lose everything remember you survived for a reason it won't be quick or  easy it's a journey put on your big girl panties and show the world who you are I did ain't nobody looking however God was with me homeless and homebound God's on time just not our time you got this
We are looking for Ian Phillips. He's blind.
This is the first thing I’ve seen about pine Island. Glad someone finally acknowledged them . 🌴👍👍😎🌴
People need to leave, not the time to try and prove anything, just leave! When the rescuers say leave, leave!
I've been homeless it can be done I will keep you prayed up seems silly don't forget to laugh for real much love and respect being homeless doesn't mean you have to be unkind
These houses look like shit before the hurricane, now there is a good excuse to rebuild again.
Pine island should be cleared of residence except for construction crews to rebuild it totally.
This is a good broadcast. Honest. real. Trustworthy. Thank you. God Bless all of you there.
Prayers to you
Pain has no color God help 🙏 us all
So when are yall going to cover the fact that fema is more interested in housing illegals than helping the disaster victims?
The sad lesson here is when you live at sea level and they tell you to run....'RUN'.
If Trump was still President he would certainly help - he would toss the poor souls paper towels .
I'm sorry waiting on help sucks God help us 🙏 all
If you are told to leave...the gov pays all.....why stay
It's a sad loss of life...but honestly avoidable with the option to evacuate. That's the most tragic.
No its not.  "We can handle it."  Its we dont have the means to leave.  Fuck head.
Are this the news or a yokel’s convention? They can fish. How much fish do you think you are going to find after a cat 4 hurricane churned the bottom all along the coast? People can boat to the fish store. Provide the coordinates of functioning stores with viable stock anywhere reachable by boat? And what currency they will accept? Are you supposed to provide a public service announcement for the services available to the citizens? Or. Are you a forum to encourage the stubborn misguided concept of self sufficiency in the midst of a disaster? Did you not listen to the insanity of the death of a medically needy person that chose to stay behind and then required medical assistance from a system that was clearly announced not to be available during the storm? People are free to choose but your pathetic celebration of their refusal to leave in the face of their reality is unconscionable, irresponsible and promotes a twisted reasoning that may end up costing more lives. The lives of first responders are as valuable that of those that chose to put themselves in harms way for no reason worth anyones life.
Where’s our government ? I’m here in NORTH Cape.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊🕊
Вотак!живут Америка с Европой!за то что делают войну!и лижут зельку сатану!
A sad situation for those who live on sandpile they should evacuate when told to do so if they choose to live there and now they wanna rebuild on a sandpile that's why I live inland on the Florida ridge high ground in Polk County no storm surge no flooding here my house isn't being washed away .
Should have left early before the hurricane arrive.
Fruits and vegetables are going to be on whatever trees are left, after a cat 4 for hurricane. Are you kidding me.
Our hearts are heavy for you! With love from Florida!💝🙏💝
Wasn't there a evacuation recommendation?
DeSantis-  the same guy who voted against FEMA FUNDING FOR HURRICANE SANDY 🌀- putting thousands without nothing- DeSantis a vocal climate change denialist- conflating science facts with conspiracy theories and insufferable republican rage grievance hysterics.  Irreversible Climate change is already here....next on the menu: Planetary Hospice, Managed Retreat, American Human Habitat Loss.  🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🇺🇸🦖☄️🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 Florida is the extinction level events.
We will pray for the people of Pine Island.  May they get the help they so desperately need or want.
WHAT?  They stayed on Pine Island knowing that a cat 4 hurricane was coming?  Why?  It’s a very small vulnerable island.  I don’t get it.  And the news story isn’t reality.  Pine island has mango trees, that’s it.  There is a big grocery store, which will deal with the obstacles to staying open until the bridge is rebuilt.  But the area is NOT a self-sufficient place at all & looks devastated.  I have land there & have spent a lot of time in the area. My heart goes out to everyone suffering as a result of this hurricane. 😅😅😅😅
They have houses that are liveable. You have not addressed Pine Island at all!!! They need basics brought in. Water, gas, toilets. They can put in a bridge or a barge. It can be done in days. Why is that not happening.? There are farms with animals etc. The lady on here says they can just  take their boats places and get supplies and fish fir food. Wiw . Are you freaking kidding me. Their boats are in people's yards and  everywhere.  Why isn't  anyone there to help. Red cross, etc. No one is paying attention. There are alot of people who want to get there to get their stuff, put tarps on. Check on , etc. Yes alot of houses are gone but their are alot of houses that are fine. This is the first time anyone has mentioned  Pine Island.  Stop worrying about Sanibel- those houses are uninsured  houses. You can't  get insurance  on houses there. Hello. People on Pine Island live there year round  or the thousands  that were  heading there this month. I am just so frustrated.  I know FL got hit hard. But this is what got hit first. Please help them. Some people on the island have power. It's crazy the lack of communication  that is going on. What if it was you? Would you want to get your pictures and a change of clothes. It is crazy. It doesn't  matter if it has to be done by air or by sea. I have family who needs to get there. Their friends are there. It's so awful for everyone.  Please help them.
I assure you they are not Liberals.  They are strong and independent individuals.
I wish i can help. From singapore. Sending my prayers.
NBC doesn’t own a helicopter 🚁?
Please Mr Hurricane wash Maga land away let them suffer like they did us doing Katrina,,the same people who doesn't believe in climate change, given all their money to a Devil con artists, just like the Queen dieing,  I don't give a Damm about Maga land
Insurance is going to be a Nightmare. If insurance actual pays out. Either paying very little or Not at all. The way Insurance is written. People might not actually cover the damage. Some insurance can be worded where it might cover certain type of damage. Might cover slight water damage, but might not actually cover agiasnt flood damage. Might not cover damage from hurricanes. might not cover agiasnt wind damage, might not cover agiasnt total lost of home.
Thr news castors do not give one shit about these people
I don’t have any sympathy for somebody who didn’t have the sense to get in their car and drive out of the path of the hurricane.  I’m a single senior citizen and I did it.
That mother could’ve gotten to her daughter if they would’ve had the sense to evacuate like they were supposed to. I’m in Tampa and we evacuated to Ocala. It’s two hours away and it was safe there
Why ..and how he get there🤷🏾‍♂️
This is reminiscent of hurricane Katrina.
The reporter in the white hat sounds like he actually cares.
Thank you for telling the story about Pine Island. I have a home in St James city and I'm going down in three weeks. I'm not sure how I'm going to get on the Island yet but I'm taking supplies down and since my boat wasn't damaged I'm going to do what I have to to support my neighbors. We'll get organized and support ourselves if the officials think it's too hard and too much trouble.
How do you feel sorry for the people who didn't want to evacuate....
Oh man!  That poor mom whose daughter died.
Probably these people are retirees sorry for the lady that loves her daughter I wish I was there to give her a hug my condolence Mother Nature is very weird
Our prayers go out to our Fellow Americans in the SE.   🇺🇸☮️
the lady is kind of dumb.ya there are vegetables, where in the coconut tree?
Insurance Companies will be leaving faster than Migrants are arriving. Bless you Florida.
Katrina might have been very bad with the death toll being in that soup bowl but we have literally whole islands cut off from the mainland here.
No government handouts stop Socialism pick yourself up by your bootstraps
1:51 What the hell is she bitching about? "Running out of fuel? Resources? You just described the entire west coast of Florida! Its been 48 hours, for Christ's sake! You live on a barrier island, and had well over a WEEK to prepare, or leave. You CHOSE to stay. Be happy that you have your life ... not everyone that was as STUPID as you still does.  Call me callous all you want ... but I live in Tornado Alley, where we get 15 MINUTES warning, not 15 DAYS.
That poor mother is heartwrenching. I hope they get the Coast Gaurd to mandatory eviction to the mainland. The American Red Cross shelters food and first aid and access to entities for help. People were told to leave...I know many do not have the resources. Long term infrastructures and the financial aid. Praying for all to have the strength and courage to continue forward.🙏⛑😪
Any word on North Captiva island?
This is why you should not live on an island
I used to do pools in that area matlache was a very unique area 💯💯💯
Part of the story that was missed for those who aren't familiar with the area, that lady who lost her daughter, unable to get to Cape Coral. Cape Coral is only 5 miles from where she was at. That's how dire the situation is.
What they want is totally different,  think the army will drop everything to help asap, your kidding aren't you!
I grew up on Pine Island (St. James City). Though I moved away after joining the military, my heart is heavy with the devastation post Hurricane Ian. "Islanders support islanders"! Please don't let the coverage only shine on Sanibel, Captiva, and Fort Myers Beach. Continue to include Matlacha and Pine Island like you all did in this segment. You are doing a great service to the community when equal coverage is distributed for all who are impacted by this storm. Thank you!
Very sad stories, praying for all of the people suffering Ian Hurricane aftermath.😢
On 9/29/22, desantis vowed to restore pine island - starting with bridge. Why isn't desantis restoring pine island as he vowed on 9/29/22? Why isn't desantis walking his talk for his constituents? How come desantis isn't getting help & supplies (he's got on hand) out there to pine island now?
he shouldnt of fked them immigrants over, karma is a bitch.  i bet he wont spend 12 million on 48 of you. and your gov voted against aid for new york hurricane, told them to help their self.
Keep them in prayers every one just keep praying for them 🙏🏾
Making this political is disgusting.
how are electric vehicles doing in the rescue efforts?
Why these people time and time again stay??!! I don't care how blue collar you are and how much you think you can handle a category 5 hurricane will end you and everything you own and if you're going to be like that don't come begging for mercy when it's all said and done.. All of it could easily be avoided if they just drove 30 minutes inland her sister would still be alive and they wouldn't be stranded with no water or food. Living somewhere for 30 years is no excuse to stay when you see it over and over I've been through enough hurricanes to know I rode out Hurricane Hugo in 1989 when I was 19 years old and that was the last one I swore to myself that I would ever ride out right on the coast and ignore evacuation orders because I was lucky to survive that night. There's no excuse of course as a human being I feel sorry but then I know it all could have been avoided they had plenty of warning and there's just no excuse for it not in the year 2022.
Where's the President or Vice President in all of this?  Why aren't they there to see the devastation for themselves??
Heartbreaking 💔💔💔
We need to remember that these people don’t have internet, telephone, tv service, or electricity. They likely have no idea how extensive the storm was.  Also there’s been zero reports of Captiva Island.
Why didn’t reporter bring them back him? He made it back!
Why is the president not doing anything to help us
