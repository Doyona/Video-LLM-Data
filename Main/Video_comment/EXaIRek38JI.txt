Is that expert lobby or what?
4:01 animation was peak
Public lobbies are gay they always vote out those who report
Wait but I play among us but the vent is down
Bruh
The animation of toast and lime😂
Blue and cyaan
i wish among us had a built in voice chat cuz its so hard to read people when all u have is text, even when u have free chat u cant rlly detect whether or not someones lying with no ques in their voice
Public lobbies rules: * if you reported a body, you are toasted * if you call a meeting, you are toasted * if you spy a lot, you are toasted *if you dont do your tasks, you are toasted * if you do your tasks, you are also toasted
You know it would be ok if he played with freeplay chat on and not quick chat
Pub lobbies are absolutely stupid and i love it. You see some goofy shit in there, and you can even use the idiocy and common tendencies to your advantage.
yeah that why quick chat suck ngl
Public lobbies make me so angry. I didn't realise how many idiots were out there...
That's the problem with public lobbies, they're just as frustrating as calling tech support numbers. They're all a bunch of idiots lol.
My man be using quick chat 💀💀
9:11  I subscribed because of this.😂👍
one time i played in a public lobby and because taskbar was on always i just was able to mass confirm people every game. i tried making a public lobby with pro player ruleset and people in these lobbies hated it.
public lobbies are the worst because you can took whin nobody
Knowing it’s never happening I’m just gonna say  Imagine toast playing with his viewers
Please do public among us discord servers with audio!
That's was funny
you must be so bad at Among Us people do vote for themselves not because they're the Imposter because they're cool
In public server usually no one talks just voting for random
This is the reason why its not that fun to play amongus players are not cooperating. Some of them leave if they are not the impostor. And most of them are like ai when in the meeting. Its more entertaining to watch people play it than actually playing it.
Relapsed into amogus hell.
🖤
Rule no. 1. Don't trust Toast Rule no. 2. Still don't trust Toast. Rule no. 3. Always vote Toast out
Public lobbies in a nutshell:
He wasn't kidding when he said not to touch it for 6 months
"Oh no! A body!" *Does Reactor* "Oh no. A body."
public lobbies are dumpster fires. so funny to see toast dive in to them
1 month left
among us public lobbies are cursed
As someone who plays public lobbies all the time, when you find a good one you immediately add them as friends lol so you can try to create better lobbies later. So many people hack, troll or are just plain odd and can’t communicate lol
The quick chat ruined the fun. Thank you InnerSloth!
Public lobbies are so toxic
Toast try public Among Us lobbies now. You'll be surprised. I've seen some among us public lobbies that were essentially filled with people who knew every in and out of the game. Like people who knew the length of every task, heard of every strategy, it was insane.
The people who voted how watching this vid right right now are shockedlol
The update is horrible
when you've watched a couple of Toast's videos, you start to realize that public lobbies don't run on any logic whatsoever
Smh toast, random people doesn’t have your IQ…perhaps even lower
"say a fking things and I will kill you"  That animation was so funny
Toast: No innocent person would vote themselves! Sykkuno in every lobby:
This is why I no longer play in the public lobbies, the amount of randomness and stupidity is infinite and beyond.
Gyazturk did O2 emergency as a normal task infront of him lol
Ah yes, the utter frustration of public lobbies. I wish I had 14 friends......lol.... cuz I actually like playing among us but really hate dealing with the 7 year olds, buddy groups, and hack users in the public lobbies. It totally takes the fun out of it when you can't actually discuss suspicions together and give accurate info. It's always a 2 second discuss time with some kid screaming "IT'S RED AND BLUE" after a second into the first round.....lol. Like dude, what is fun about paying for a game hack and spoiling it for the rest of the people.
Pubic lobbies are so dum
Public lobbies suck so bad
fucking chewymint man
Public lobbies make me so mad 😂 they not the brightest sometimes
Public lobbys in AMONG US are so hard because almost everyone is dumb.
You never do your tasks
you feel our pain
Play more brother. So much fun watching. Well played
Public lobbies are frustrating lmbo
This is what I hate when playing in public lobbies, so many stupid players
Roles are the worst thing to happen to Among Us
Public lobbies hurt everyone's brains
" Whereeeeeee 😏 "
this is fuckin hilarious LMAOO we need more pub lobbies
Uh man!
To be fair, the new chat system is really bad in AU
Ahaha
big brain... little something else. how is your boyfriend satisfied?
0:19 Rae???
💪👏👍 You're lucky I wasn't there 😏
Wait I’m pretty sure I was in this game
What’s the song at the beginning of the video?
Toast looks really sus in publics cos he never does his tasks lol
He said he experienced all the things in among us but... He is still far from experiencing everything
The first round, vitals didn’t work because you didn’t recharge it with tasks. To recharge vitals you must do your task and once you’re done with all your tasks it just has a cooldown.
You can't even type freely in Among us anymore... it's that bad.
God this reminds me of the first lockdown when i used to watch Toast and his friends amoung us streams every night :')
The King of Imposters
Remember when this dude lie to you all, and now when he see that among us made him famous he whana that money
this just shows how much it's the difference
This can not be real.
Yes
No innocent person would vote for themselves  Sykkuno: and I took that personally
He's still got it!
@Disguised toast maybe when you play again  in 6+ months you should have a 15man lobby
If you have log in on among us, you can use free chat, not the quick chat, it works for me on my tablet,
He left out the fact that Gyazturk was in fact the impostor.
If you’re the first person to say where I will always instavote you. Doesn’t matter how innocent you might be it will always be sus. Notice how Toast only said where when he was imposter?? You know I’m right
I would like to see Toast play random lobbies with vc, perhaps with a voice changer so he doesn’t get targeted haha
Why won’t you play custom lobbies anymore?
I saw an ad on my xbox for among us... it wasnt that long ago but i miss those days my life always seems to be going downhill so im pretty capable of latching on to the things that matter to me and toasts among us content and my own play of among us brings such nostalgia i wish i could turn back time i really do
t
amazing! i thought i got to play with dream rea and badboy the other day but i dont think they saw me! 👻
Why they get rid of type to chat for that ???? 😂 tffff
Toast: "No innocent person would vote for themselves" my mind: Except for Sykunno
More among us content????
You should play among us but during meeting you can only say 3 words! Mr.Fruit did it awhile ago and I thought it was pretty funny
I can't stand non chat public lobbies... People just do whatever... With no rhyme or reason, it's like FuryRoad but worse!! 🤯
"And its just that ez" 🤣
U should try Goose goose Duck with crew its bether then amongus and it would be the best to see ur 1000 iq moves
Its so hard playing among us without typing
Dam i missed this
It'd be funny if any of those people who played in those lobbies watched this
Chewy mint was obviously it
since u're playing with pub lobby, why not organize a lobby with ur viewer?
Probably never gonna read this, but what about playing with subscribers?
Quick chat feature was meant to make the game easier, it makes the game harder, I stopped playing Among Us because of it, you can't even type normally now, I thought quickchat would just be an alternative
People in public lobbies are kinda idiots so yeah it is harder
Still the Goat 🐐
It's honestly funny how in most of the games he played no one knew how to type in chat manually
Hello Mr Toast i like your cartoon animation of among us can you hire people animation dull video hahahaha love you///
"Time to not touch among us for another 6 months." You were kidding, right?
Still got it!
"Time to not touch among us for another 6 months" Does this mean you'll play again in 6 months?
Shifter at 1:46
I miss the old gang
I want to see old toast crew and crewfu for like at least 1 video
Honestly public games are so hard it’s like they have a mind of there own to vote for anyone but they always right
I missed among us
I have not watched Toast in months probably. But when I tell you I got so excited when I saw Toast and Among Us together again omg!!
Toast playng amongus? Love it
“How may times did you watch this video?” Yes.
Among us actually degenerated over time...
playin with safe chat be like
I wouldn't suggest saying "where" as impostor. Silence is better.
Toast: "guys it's chewymint" Also Toast: *gets voted out* Me: "first time?"
"no innocent person would vote for themself" oh you dont know public lobbies then 😅 they are all just trolls
lookin good toast!!
miss this
I hate playing lobby because many players are idiots, and just vote randomly without justification
When toast is imposter in a crowd of unsuspecting minions, the lobby is doomed.
Go play suspects!
Him not using free text is very aggravating
Better than sunde any day
Imagine being imposter duo with toast and having no idea😂
"Still got it" with the pose killed me :D
Hey, Toast! Good to see you happy with the content you're putting out again and well, seeing you again in general! Hey, if you still like playing Among Us, ChilledChaos has an evening lobby that gets together a few times a week and I bet he'd love to have you there! Just, if you can't find anyone to play with! Okay! Bye! <³
it's the "we got them boys" or me 😄
Chewymint didn't even vote for toast after accusing him. He thought it was over lol
We will never know if it was chewymint or not 😐
The return of a legend
that jawline tho
We have miss you 🤗💝
Go to settings and you can turn off that wierd chat
Toast: chilling Others: ITS HIMMM
When you have no idea what to upload 😂😂😂😂
NO WAY A BIT LATE BUT NOOOOO WAAAAAAAY!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHH TOASTIEEE
Once upon a time, everyone was suspecting orange. They voted orange including me. I didn't realise that I was orange and voted...myself out :D it was hilarious, but I was not impostor tho haha. Idk why they were sus of me
When will the old lobbies with the new features come into play?
full of idiots in public lobbies
Bro the last time I played was a year ago, omg it's so different now I'm so confused.
AMONG US!!!
This is like if your radiant in a iron bronze lobby trying to big brain them thinking they will try to counter caus ethey are smart but they're to dumb to even understand wtf is a big brain
This was posted on my birthday! Great gift from Toast!!
Can never assume public lobies are competent
BRING IT BACK!
Wholly shit
i guess you could call him disguised toast DISGUISED
Among us with disguised toast but he plays with randoms over discord w/ voicechanger. I would watch that.
lies ✨✨✨ LOOL
00:58 03:55 05:50 awwww 06:54 07:44 09:12
the best thing that happened to me in 2020  is disguisedToast. Laughed though the night watching him play among us. brb sobbing
Nostalgia lol
Ppl be dumb broo💀💀😭😭—..
PLSS— CHEWY MINT SHOULDVE KEPT WATCHING HAHA PEOPLE R PROBABLY MAKING LOBBYS..
I love toast soo much haha :((..
Now you feel my pain
I missed your videos so much! Would love to see more like this. :D
Yesssss
I will admit, Ikinda miss those among us vids
Toast: No innocent person would vote for himself Sykkuno: 👁👄👁
I wonder why he was playing with quick chat
"Time to not touch Among Us for another 6 months" 😭😭 public lobbies are so hard they make you actually go away from among us
When the world needs him, The legend is back to play Among Us. I waited so long to see Toast plays again new current Among Us update that have new roles and features, I am soo happy to watch him playing this game again 😄😃😀😁.
Wauw toast looks like he lost a lot of weight! Is he dieting?
The safe chat thing ruined the fun in public lobbies
With thanks and gratitude I'm grateful 🤘🏾
WAS IT CHEWYMINT THO
WHAT HAPPENED TO NOT PLAYING AMOGUS FOR THE NEXT YEAR??
Oh heck yeah, this was nice to watch. Good refresher
Toast should try goose goose duck...
black kill pink
Idk if anyone noticed or probs someone already commented about the thumbnail I noticed its the meme - this is fine
Playing in public lobbies is so irritating
Toast: “And no innocent person would vote for themselves”   Me: “well actually”
This needs more views!
I never got into the game . Only thing that made it good are the personalities. Almost all social games are terrible 😞
OMG I WAS IN YOUR LOBBY! I was hardfeet, but my phone died 😭. I was the imposter too!!!
OMG I WAS IN YOUR LOBBY! I was hardfeet, but my phone died 😭. I was the imposter too!!!
Public lobbies are full of idiots and thats being nice
He came back!!! Them funds running low lmao!!!!
I miss actual lobbies with toast and everyone 😔
Why is Toast so handsome though? He has such a great smile!!
Toast looking really good....
Liked before even watching the video, ( welcome back TOAST)
I missed your among us videos
Why add quick chat if the normal chat is much faster than the quick chat
gg
I would love for toast to play Among us Again
Outro song?
It is harder because you are not talking or know the people at all. And people vote you out because of the most stupid reasons. I was an impostor didn't kill anyone just go through speci and someone was like I vented I just responded why would someone do that and they vote me out for doing basically nothing
I would love if your old crew would play with the roles the ChilledChaos plays with. It would be very different and refreshing seeing you guys try it.
this game sucks now
For the cute animations timestamps, save yourself some time in replaying back. You're welcome~ 0:15 - Hey, what's up? 3:50 - Guys? 7:30 - Where...?
I’ve missed these.
Bring back among us content
I don't think he understands public lobbies...I trolled with two friends on one imposter lobby, whoever saw us kill we would all three just say it was that person.
Didnt got the notificationn maaan
This is my experience with the public lobbies from before also. Everyone just votes because of name drops. :D hahahha glad you enjoyed/suffered in public lobbies Toast.
Now toast is playing us commoners
YES!!!
No wonder why ppl say "kids ruined this game"
Now Toast Back to His Habitat.......UGHHHHHHHH
GOD BIG BRAIN TOAST MONGUS IS BACK🔥🔥🔥🔥
Return of among us series
Toast loss a lot of weight
the king is back *pretty sus*
Toast I think you can change to “quick chat only” where u can just type on the chat box rather than choosing which words. to formulate the words better
Normal among us has roles now?
I missed the animations sooo much
They ruined the game by getting rid of normal chat functions
this is so funny hahaha
I was so stressed watching him playyyy like: omg not the same but still great
“No innocent person would vote for themselves” Sykunno does it all the time as crew lmaoooo.
as soon as i saw that title i knew he was in for some bull shit
I would love to see him play town of Salem
It’s so hard cause you can only use pre written messages now
Please do more
He looks so different now!!!
Imagine being one of those random lobby players and seeing this game in a YouTube video!
Lol yes there is roles and 15 people lobbies.  The 15 people lobbies happened not too long after you stopprd playing among us and the roles came out a couple weeks ago.  I love shapeshifter which us like morphling it causes so much confusion at times lol.
Fuck ya, this is Classic. My jam! The reason i started playing myself. Hella funny.
That was it?
It feels crazy to know that he played this in 2020 and it’s almost 2022 like it feels like yesterday man
Wow I didn't realize how much I missed watching Toast play Among Us. It used to be part of my daily routine for months.
He still has that 1000 IQ whenever he plays as an impostor
Shouldn’t have been uploaded tbh, just because you’re out of video ideas doesn’t mean you tease us with among us my guy 😔
Dud... Sure I miss this shit
Toast among us animations are a delight~
😂
I do miss the Disguised Toast Among Us animations.
the pain he felt playing in these public lobbies 💀 i felt that, it’s horrible
Toast try SUPER SUS game, please
i missed this
"Ope, yup, still got it"😂
"Disguised Toast if he were bad"
Public lobbies, much harder than streamer lobbies.
Thank fuck
oh dang this makes me so happy
Anybody else get the feeling Toast misses Among Us a little bit? Lol.
you guys should make a holiday among us special return please :'(
Toast looking goooooood
Awesome video.
Its nice seeing Toast play again. Too bad the lobbies were kinda rough. I usually find some good ones late in the night and into the AMs
But was it ChewyMint?!? I NEED TO KNOW
The struggles of a public lobby
You still talk a lot when you are impostor LOL
This was fun. Thanks for the video
master class
aw man,. this reminds me on how much i miss this
OMG YAY TOAST
aaaaahhh memories of the good old 2020. <3
OH MY GODDD IT WAS YOU WHO WE WERE PLAYING WITH?!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bringing it all back again….
Toast still got it 😂
Bahahaha I hate playing public. So annoying
Public among us lobbies make me lose my faith in humanity.
No innocent person would vote for themselves.... who tells saykuno? 😆
I miss your among us videos toastt
Your zero views on twitch says it all.....
Toast The only one after taking two IQ testes showing he is not a genius but believes he is still a genious. Listening to him it’s apparent he lacks knowledge. Toast Why don’t you take a test or two for narcissism.
Off topic but he’s so attractive
bread and butter ez muney
😭😭lmao
Why you lost few pounds it seems
At 4:48 he called that it was cyan and blue but it turns out it wasn't but at 5:54 Toast was cyan and his partner was blue and they were both imposter so he was actually making a 200k iq play
Glad to see you back man! Just don't go to that place that we don't speak of again. Its a bad place xD
LFG!!! Toast still has it!
Old lad Toast still doesn’t do his tasks🤦‍♀️
TOOOAAAAAST!
The animations are still so good XD
they are insanely confusing
When the world needed him the most, He came back!
omg, am I dreaming?!
Was good to see Toast back
OH MY GOODDDNESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS TOAST IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
legend is back
Guys....guys.....GUYS!!!!!!!😂😂😂
oh wow among us changed a lot
90% of the lobbies are kids trying to role play and I hope it gets fixed somehow
Gus? 5:55
⚠️ *Innersloth should make lobbies with auto preset decent settings and add you to lobbies based on your experience level so that you find decent players at high levels*  What Innersloth does instead: *"NEW SKINS!!!*
omg this was poosted on my bday and Toast actually played Amogus
Keeping posting among us, don't stop! We love it! Toast you gotta keeping posting! 🔥
WTF YOU'RE BACK YOU'RE BACK
Hey bro r you ok you look diffrence since last i watch you?
The nostalgia
I stopped playing this game after you couldnot write in meeting. It just made difficult to communicate.
Damn,toasts fine
Next you should play using free chat. You can get more details that way
"No innocent person would vote for himself!" Dude must have forgotten all about poor Sykkuno.
it's really not a disguised toast video if he isn't voted out for catching the impostor
Haven't played this in months but public lobbies are ass. You have morons who just instaaccuse you randomly out of nowhere and then have people playing in calls that throw games to their friends. Also can't forget the idiots that just randomly vote
dang toast is looking good
I like how you say Chewymint
Immediate thought: oh no
Lesss goo. Amongus
Honestly for me the best part of watching you play among us was the interactions with the other people you played with.
People still playing this game
bruh gyazturk looked like he faked o2
it's too fucking easy for him it's unfair
Glad to see you back, my man! ^^ also, happy to see there’s new content in among us :p
You will never see this comment but I MISSED U DADDY TOAST ❤️❤️
Next title: "I tried Among Us for 2 days."  Then: "I tried Among Us for 90 days." After: "...1337 days." Then: "...1900, 2100, 2550, 3100, 3750, 3900 days" Next thing you know "16,100 DAYS / 17,600 DAYS..."
I try among us in twitch so that it will rack up viewers.. 🙄
Since when Toast looks skinny O.o, was he on a diet?
good vid :)
king
Public among us lobby’s always have dumb people
AMOGFUS
Bring it back baby. Let's go!
i FeEl bEtraYeD..
LOL i miss your amongus vids, toast.
"No innocent person would vote for themselves"  *Sykkuno has entered the chat*
Why is there no dislike ratio...?
“Well no innocent person would vote for themself..” *cough cough sykunno cough cough*
about time we get to see u again..
Omgggggeee
I love the little animations
I have never been so happy to see a video recommendation 😂
Disguised Toast umdercover. So happy to see him again.
The public lobbies are such a brainfuck  They're hard mostly because kids can't be bothered to have a reasonable discussion, listen or make any sense.
What happened? Why is toast streaming in twitch now? Any experts?
We need more of this !!
Omg I love this and toast looks so good wtf havent seen him in ages !!
Return of the King
TRY PUBLIC DISCORD LOBBIES!!!! SEE HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU TO GET NOTICED
Toast my man you're not rusty. Public lobbies are just... different.
Our boy still got it. He made us very proud today.
Previous game Toast said it was blue and cyan and the next game it was him and blue
start playing again with frends ! :D
Ngl really missed this but as long as hes happy thats what matters
How dare he give us another taste and say he wont touch it for another 6 months 😤
Ahhh... a Toast Among Us vid. The NOSTALGIA (of 2020). :)
You didnt fall off + no ratio
You're back!!!
"no innocent person would vote for himself... right?" Me having flashbacks of all the times Sykkuno voted himself when he was crew... in Toast's own videos....
missed you toast!
Dusting off the rust boissss 😂 so happy to see this again 😍😍😍
just go to the settings and make it free or quick chat, then you can chat normally and others aswell, its wayyy better then.
The Comeback we all wanted!
Idk man, I don't think I Iike that jawline. I miss cheeky detective toast😔
King
Seeing Toast playing Amongus again makes me smile :D
I miss u playing among us
welcome back toast
"that was fun, time to not touch among us for another six months" that got me LMAOOO
Among us players are the same... they just vote people with no info
Public lobbies are cancer. It's just little kids who vote anyone off randomly without logic. Plus, you can't have fun with voice chat and try to convince people.
This made me so happy to see
The return of 50,000 IQ crewmate. Also toast is looking really gooood. Miss your dumpling cheeks tho ❤️
Hi Toast
hmm came back huh
Toast pls play more ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
I feel like the quality of the brain tingling strategy videos is over. Public servers are way to casual. Much love though Toast
My fav streamer cameback
Lmao Toast too funny
Return of the King
Video should have been called, toast comes backs And dominates competitive lobbies
This is the goat back in action boys
People still play this abortion?
Ok this was hilarious
HIS FACE IS SLOWLY TURNING INTO COOL SHIN LIM FACE. His hair proves it. Sus.
I DIDNT THINK I’D SEE YOU PLAY IT AGAIN AW
among us toast became soooo old that his iq points didn't increase anymore edit 1: also the top hat on his profile vanished
Looks so healthy after all the stuff he been talking about in old videos and streams now look 👀
random lobby’s have 1 iq players the one iq is for them too vote that’s all they knoe
This why I made an account,  just so I wouldn’t have to deal with the limited chat options. I want to be mean to a bunch of 10 year olds who voted me out after I caught the imposter.
Didn't know public lobbies became more dumber.
When i see toast play with his friends it makes me want to re download among us, when I see him play in public lobbies it reminds me why I deleted among us.
people not knowing they played with a disguised toast until this video: 😮🤯😭😭
Random lobby with kids are the worst.
His Podcast with Jae explains how toast will take a break with amongus for more months. Take ur time to regen toast!
these are kinda decent for public lobbies lol
Nooo I'm please play more!!!
during the early boom of the game, i got into many smart lobbies. we actually deduce shits. but ever since the SUS meme blew up, i get dumb lobbies more lmao
Ngl I've been missing among us. You should play more that would be amazing :D
that was fun hahaha
ive been waiting for this one!
Bring back the hearthstone content!!!
suffer like we suffered in the public lobbyyy
Jumpybut: Sykkuno in disguise
The time stamps has funny names
I miss the among us animation ❤️
i want to see toast play mario party lol
My sus has only returned when  the update returned. I AM LEVEL 40 AND HAVE ALL THE SKINS AND VISORS AND PETS THAT ARE FREE.
This shows why Among Us was/is actually terrible unless you have a full lobby of friends.
Public lobbies sucks.. Hahaha
Nooo he prolapsed
Among Us public lobbies is the worst community for a multiplayer game.
He could just start playing amoogus again and noone would even bat an eye. We would just pick up where we left off and all would be right in the world lol
Toast should make a account then put a name and be able to chat Freely
oh no, wait.. was he streaming? people in public lobbies stream snipe 😔
finally, i love content like this plus i feel like it really is the test to see if you’re as good as you think you are without proximity chat or chat with your friends like in meetings lol
Im actually really glad seeing he play the game again and editor still doing good job with the video..
This among us looks so bad now..
WHAT IS THIS
Public lobbies are toxic and dumb
this feels like arriving home
did he lose weight?!?!
SUS
Toast high key glowed up. proud of the man
It's good to be back
TOAST’S SMILE WHEN HE WON WAS SO CUTE OMG
still got it boyyss
Feels so good to see you back on among us :) toast ❤️
HE'S BACK😍🥰😍this is FUN🥰😍
Classic Toast, doing the least expected thing that was expected all along
*So that was a fucking lie*
I really needed this
Thank you GOD for answering my prayers!! There is nothing else I missed as much from yt❤️❤️
This update is absolute ass
God I hate the new among us updates. They completely ruined public lobbies by taking away free chatting.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how good toast looks? He looks so healthy and his hair suits him so much
Should have switched from Europe to North America
Nowr thats nostalgic
I need more of these I missed toast playing among us 😩
THIS IS UNEXPECTED?!!?!
Everybody who watches this and played is gonna be like 🤯
YES YES YES YES YES, I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! NOW MY DEPRESSION WILL GO AWAY! WAHOO!!!!!!!!
Pubs in this game are just cancer. Nobody ever has any real evidence. It's just a bunch of people making random guesses and some times those guesses are right.
Lmao XD. I find it a bit funny that Pokemane tried peer pressuring Toast to play in their lobby for the new update but toast refused. Now he plays in a random lobby with strangers. Lol.
i miss the among us days so much
Nooooo not another 6 months. I need my toast among us content 😭
E MUNK GUS!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!++
This part of the strim was so hilarious and painful at the same time LMAO the normal amogus communications in Toast's lobbies was nonexistent
Public lobbies is where the fun dies
It's a Shame He Didn't Find Any Leat Fingies Out There..
“No innocent person would vote for themselves.”   Sykkuno:
Wow I wasn’t expecting Toast playing among us again. The memories 🥲
i miss among us era 🥺
PLAY SUSPECTS!!!
Welcome to hell toast (Public Lobbies)
amogus
how about having voiceovers for the muted players? :D That will be interesting hehe
You missed so much lol
Noo we miss u😭
YEEEEEESSSSS
The most fun way to play public lobbies is to find an Among Us discord server so you can use voice chat. So much information is lost in text chat games.
he said he won't play again but he looked like he enjoyed it
still got it!
1 imp in a 15 people lobby, this reminds me that there's one time I was in a 1v9, and the kill cool down is 40 seconds, while the button is like 30, so they just press the button and randomly vote someone out every 30 seconds and I can't do anything
Used quick chat because typing was blocked? To changing it is in games options.
I genuinely hate the new chat update  Well not that new anymore but whatever
Why did two people vote for me?... Guys?..     guuuyyyys!  😂🤣
Gotta brush the dust off every once in a while to keep from getting rusty
Welcome back KING 👑✨
-1IQ to -20000IQ public lobby amongus edition
Is this the comeback?
So how did you feel Toasty mate?
ALL HAIL THE AMONG US GOD DISGUISEDTOAST
did he do the Hafu stretching at the end? :D
this is like watching Hinata from Haikyuu going to Brazil to play beach volleyball. Toast is training
Toast is such a funny and charismatic person it’s crazy lol
You should try 15 people with friends
Contents like this are always entertaining when it comes from you, Toast. Looking forward to more! Public lobbies seem kinda fun <3
I missed this🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Sherlock, the legendary mastermind, the trained freaking assin, the best friend of sykkuno and valkray. I thought I would never see the three amigos.
3:51 XD
The new chatting system ruined among us...  Its a dumb decision   Now people are just gonna randomly vote....  Because part of lying in among us is the acting... I guess the Way you type..  Your behavior in chat.. But you cant really express your self much  If its just generated words..   You cant sound smart with unfamiliar words because..  Its generated words..   You cant say stop and listen for my alibi..
He lost a lot of weights. Look at his jaw line🥵
He still got it,... Im getting emotional
Imagine the reaction of these random players that actually played with toast when they watch this video
The King is back
The animations is still spot on!
why the public lobby smarter than lobbies from before
what is going on

KEKW
What of he started doing his lobby's again... it would be nice 🤷‍♂️
You need a lesson from me finally. I've always been taking them from you. Hit me up my man.
miss the "who faked dragon"
Toast: “Gyazturk you one of the good ones. I’ll follow you around.”  Meanwhile: Gyazturk is trying to do 02 as a task Toast: “ I’ll make sure nothing bad happens to you buddy.
Toast is only good at among us if they have voice chat because people rlly don't chat much and explain throughly lol
Toast was a big part of my day in the AmongUs era. He's still a big part of my day though.
Toast please  post TFT videos again. I mean always see u playing with albert and scarra. Why not try content again?
OMG I STILL WATCH YOUR OLD VIDEOS, IM SO HAPPY WITH THIS UPLOAD
The editing is muah 💋
Toast: “Gyazturk you one of the good ones. I’ll follow you around.”  Meanwhile: Gyazturk is trying to do 02 as a task Toast: “ I’ll make sure nothing bad happens to you buddy.
WAHHHH HE IS FREAKING BACK!
Nice!
I thought I was tripping when I saw this
the GOAT is back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No innosent purson would vote for themself Syykuno:......
i love how toast returned to among us. like so unexpected and so him. he really is always ahead of everyone
Quality content
I miss this
Something never change in among us is never trust crewmate only trust impostors 😂😂😂
YOUR NAME IS LANKYBAT???? I PLAYED WITH YOU!!!!
This one time I had 3 task in admin I had wire download and cardwipe I was there for a long time with 6 PPL! AND THEY ALL ACCUSED ME WHEN I WAS IN ADMIN THE ENTIRE TIME WITH 6 PPL. I told them I went wire, download, cardwipe then table. I named all the colors who were there so they were in the clear AND TOLD THEM THE ONLY 3 PLAYERS WHO Could KILL... and narrowed it down to one bc the last 2 were a pair and they all VOTED ME...IM LIKE I WAS WITH 6 PPL WHY AM I GETTING VOTED OFF.... AND GUESS WHO IT WAS...THE ONE I SAID WHO IT WAS The point i was making is public lobbies are the dumbest, toughest lobbies to play It was the dumbest lobby I ever played with and I played in a lot of dumb lobbies. I just had to tell this story bc it also still puts a rage in me bc the amount of stupidity and blindness in that game
The toast boy don't even have an account
This just goes on to show how trash this game is with public lobbies.
Been a while toast, been a while
Why’s no one talking about how good toast looks
YESSSSSS TOASTTT IS BACKK❤️
I just watched the podcast with Jae where he said he wouldn't play for another year and now this, I feel blessed Also, everything you do is enjoyable for us to watch so I hope you'll keep doing things that you enjoy too Toast
WOOO AMOGUS
Toast you better upload another one tomorrow lol
The voice comms are what make this game great. I tried playing public lobbies and it was very disappointing
“No innocent person would vote for themself” …meanwhile Sykkuno…
yay among us return
The return of the king
Only innocent sykunno would vote him self
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Can someone please tell me when and where did he stream this?
Why was this so hilarious to me?
No iq so
Lets go the king is back
Wow i thought he quit bruh u cool

5:16 are you speak Malay or English? :0
squid game person
33 on trending
When you realize you got the chance to play with disguised toast 😳
ဗီူ totally did not just scream in the middle of the night and frightened my mom after realizing Toast has uploaded
My lord you have returned to the kingdom
This content of toast making a return to among us would definitely bring the game back on the map again
Just play TFT
GOSPEL - THIS IS HOW YOU ARE SAVED!  Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, you are a sinner in need of a savior!  Repent and ask Jesus to come into your heart and he will change your life.  You will be filled with the Holy Spirit who will show you the way, He will become your best friend and He will guide your steps.  Praise the Lord, God Almighty!  Hallelujah!  1 Corinthians 15:1-4 1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
ahahah love toast memeing like this
lol, still gonna watch in the next 6 months then
I missed this so much
0:59 Sykkuno:
5:31 random lobby in nutshell
May I ask you out on a date? You can use our date as material for creating new content. Imagine forcing your date to hold a camera the entire time, recording everything you eat and all the fans who want to take a picture with you. I'm sure you could come up with a humorous title for the video.
Toast the hat on your logo has gorn walkabout were is it
Damn the weightloss. Good for you toast!
I'm SO happy I can't believe he did Among Us content again huzzzzzah!!!
Only Toast can make this game alive again
They really ruined this game when they changed the chat system
when none of your friends what to play amogus with you so you play with strangers
Best notification ever!!!
now go play among us with your friends
nice to see you visit. Hope you are doing well. See you later
the animations are so nostalgic now
can't wait to see best friends Lankybat and POOKHA playing together again.
honestly I've had some pretty fun public lobbies, generally the settings actually tell you a lot about the group you are playing with so keep an eye on the settings and you're on your way to a good lobby...statistically anyways
Seeing that beautiful twitch chat flow elegantly to the right is glorious!
Please play in one of sykkunos lobbies!
The most annoying player of among us is back
Imagine seeing urself in this game knowing u played against toast lol
Toast experiencing the same pain we got in public lobbies lmao, but it's good to see him playing this once again ^^
Was waiting for this for so long.... thanks a bunch 😭❤️❤️
Toast is really so good at Among Us. He should start an AU series or something.
Late but toast your back haha
If u sing in u can chat
Babushkaa will be back!
He is back!! Amigos will be back. Good old time ❤️
This was a fun stream 🤣🤣 so happy the kings back on twitch 👑
Hahahahaha oh my god the public lobbies really are harder than his lobbies
unable to type in chat is so dumb
Animator still out here releasing great clips.
I miss this
this guy was the reason i started watching Among Us and also the reason why I stopped watching it. I'm glad that he made this video and gave us a chance to watch another video again!
Am am am am am AMONGUS?!?!
Broo yess new video😍✨
JUst me or is toast's profile picture yellower than usual
They r so stupid they don't leave any clues. They r so dumb they r kinda smart.
This is hilarious. Glad to see Toast trying Among Us again... public lobbies is bad though. Should've just invited fans to play. Also how has Toast not made an account to free type after playing for over a year?
Mog us
King of among us has returned
This just feels right Toast.  We need you back in Among Us.
Sherlock is back!!!
Now Toast needs to play with the group and new roles
you realise everyone is following u cus of among us ?
i was so confused because i was rewatching all your old videos, then saw this.. i though i missed one of your videos and then i realized this vid was uploaded 20 hours ago🥲
The Legendary Toast

I haven’t watched among us since you last played consistently and it has changed sm wtf

Damn I have not played the game in so long. They really changed a lot.
Hahahah playing Among Us with random people is frustrating... Hope you participate in the next among us reunion with the crew :')
public lobbies made among us despising to play, too many unintelligent people are roaming the lobbies
DisguisedTost vs 5Up vs Hafu vs TrainwrecksTV vs Yeti vs xQc. Do it now plz thx
Didn’t he just do podcast explaining why he’s not coming back in a year?
WHAT UNIVERSE ARE WE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW?
Nice strech after winning hehe
a Christmas miracle
"Time to not touch among us for six months" So you're saying there's a chance?
my biggest question is... was it actually chewymint
michael jordan of among us has return back to the bulls to prove his goatness
Me when realizing that toast doesn't have an account: Interesting
he skips when he's imposter and votes are anonymous
Hate the editing, was it Chewymint or not?!
MORE OPEN LOBBIES

Good Ol Times
Disguisedtoast 2 not gonn be active anymore?

I really missed the little among us animation in Toast's video good job Toast keep it up on the grind! :)
Toast getting voted off after catching an impostor as usual...
Toast, you can type normally if you turn on the mode of the chats to type.
Just make a long term comeback toast.
That took me back to the good old days... aka last year when my day would start/end with Disguised Toast's newest among us video. I miss the thrill of seeing a new 5head video.
I am thankful for you toast !
lets go!!!
I didn’t think..
Dude  I thought you stopped playing among us
Omg he's back 😶
Please make more of these..........Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee
KINGGGGG
Public Among Us was quite fun to watch, because you can guess along as a chatter and give hints.
Why do people not just type? The text selection thing takes forever lol
Love to see you back
The king of AMONG US is finally back
NO ONE SEE IT COMING
Yoooooo Welcome Back on among us toast
I played with a pink Lankybat a few days ago! I wonder if it was him?

Seeing the notification of Toast & Among Us on my phone made so ridiculously happy 😂😂
Love watching toast’s among us content. Glad to see some more of it. Also really missed frosturne’s among us animations. So cute.
THE KING IS BACK, THE FREE SEROTONIN
Play with friends again it's gonna be so much funny with 15 players
Finally, please do more public lobbys   When peeps come and watch ur vid dey will say ayee I played with the one and only Disguised Toast
Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.  Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.  That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.  Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:  amogus sus
Glad to see Toast has returned to Among Us. Welp time for me to return to Among Us now :D
Well that retirement was short lived
OMG.... THE KING IS BACK!!!
The return of the messiah
Hell yeah ... ✨🤧

I just came here from watching his one year old among us videos, Toast looks so different woah
TOASTT!!
YESSSSS
I was not expecting Toast to make an among us video today out of all things.
Having watched this on stream, we should all appreciate how much effort and talent the editors puts into making this entertaining. Because that stream was painful to watch.
This is what I've been encountering when I play Among Us since I dont have friends to play with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
So he'll play with randoms on the internet but not he's friends when they ask?
Glad to see you back! I hope you've been well! Although, O_o?... did you lose weight? It's not a bad look, though hopefully you've still got enough nutrients stored up to power that gigastructure of a brain.
Omg i missed this 😭
All of the cute animations: 0:18 3:53 7:39
Toast had a better humour when he was fat

Yay ! Toast is back ! Don't worry Toast there are lots of games which test your iq skills and you can socialize together. The Toast fan club is ready to suggest!  Ay ay Captain Toast! 😃
You should try other deceit games like first class trouble or agrou
im glad we get another among us video but im just as glad to see this clean among us edits and animations
Back to my morning routine- The king has returned
yooooo why toast always so good looking??? how am I supposed to watch the among us game with his face cam??? ugh.
The new things they did was okay exepct for the chat system for new people because they just don’t want new people already saying bad things in the Chat so they made the dumb chat system
HE HAS RETURN!!! THE OHMA ZI-O OF AMONG US!!!
aweee i legit miss the edits
Geez...among us got hella updates...sure has been a while
Public Among Us lobbies are like the internet. People are so quick to judge and naive.
And here the people of the lobby never suspect the Sherlock is in their game, so sus.
Yaaayy he’s back!!
Finally wait is over Love from India❣️
When you have no other content or games people want to see.... GG
LOVE YOU TOAST
7:40 "whEere? I dOn't knoww"

He really upload the among us video😂 I really miss the cyan jelly bean toast on space
"time to not touch among us for another 6months"  Alright, no pressure. Play whatever game with friends.
Plot Twist: ChewyMint was Rae typically kicking out Toast while Gyazturk was Sykkuno being an imaginary Jester. lol
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS

I would have never expected Toast to be back!! So beautiful!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE THE ANIMATION!! WTH ❤️❤️
Hail the return of the king
The entire time I was watching this I was smiling 😊
“Be honest who else is a few hours late” 😂
Public lobbies are either the most confusing thing because of how stuiped it is or it's confusing because of how smart people are
How is he always the safe vote in 5 even in public lobbies? 😂😂
Oh boy let me mark that in my Calendar 🗓️. See y'all in 6 months
He's back....
omg yas king is backkk
I just woke up and saw this and I can't still believe it😩
If the vid reach 500k likes, maybe he will return to making sus contents
wait... he uploaded?
Why did you change your profile pic?  The previous one was good!
Toast got thin
Dang, I haven’t watched Toast in a while, and he must have been working out. He looks great
I woke up to this notification. Am I still sleeping?
I wanna see toast play among us again with his freinds
1:00  Sykunno every game ever
HE''S BACK!!????

Toast is too big brained that he gets voted out as crewmate even in a public lobby

"Whenever you feel useless, just remember that White Pencils like me exist"  -White Pencil
3:47 i relate to this scenario on a spiritual level <3
I absolutely loved this video!
What a good thanksgiving gift <3
Premium Amogus content.
I thought I was trippin for a sec when I saw a new Toast Among Us vid 😂
I have been waiting for this day to come my whole life.
not the same without voice
It now has five fixed button which is great
i never thought id see this video, almost didnt believe my eyes when i saw the thumbnail and the channel being the og disguised toast
Toast still have it
hes back
i thought i was dreaming for a sec
So this is how smurfing in among us is like
Public lobby is stupid, they just voted people without proof
"Still got it" YEAHH BOIIIII
Toast getting handsome day by day istg
TOAST IS BACK? 💀
toast missed the game
What made me like Toast
another 6 months? really?
Bring it backkkkkk
Ayooooo
the drought ends here welcome back, toast!
6 months. That's fair.
this is gonna break the internet OMGGGG
im not going to thank you..but im thankful
Am I... Hallucinating?
The king is back
Yo WTF ????
It has been update recently, toast
my daily routine is back
I miss this.  Especially the animations.  They were always the best
where?
I was definitely not expecting him returning to this
Whoa what
👀
Oh man not more amoung us, get a different game
KING RETURN . . .
OMG I THOUGHT THIS WAS REUPLOAD AT FIRST. TOAST IS BACCKKKK
Even Toast can't lift the curse on public among us matches.
Public lobbies… the place where I repeatedly got voted for being “sus” without anybody actually saying why I’m sus… I found it surprising that Toast wasn’t malding at how nobody really listened to reason since you just have to toss the word sus at somebody to get them voted off and there’s nothing you can do because you can’t prove their evidence wrong if they never gave anything except the word “sus”.
Hey Toast, how about trying Among Us with your fans
I would genuinely love to play a game of among us with Toast. It would be such an interesting experience.
I'm feeling public lobby Among Us Toast!!! Keep them coming bro! :)
Loved this man!!!
I LIVE FOR TOAST CONTENT
TOAST IS BACK, GLAD YOURE DOING  FINE. UPLOQD UPLOAD UPLAOD
Just like the good old days. Lol
LETS GO!!!!!
public lobbies are so funny
Plz just start making among us videos.....
I literally watched EVERY SINGLE AMONG US VIDEO that was posted by toast, valk, corpse, sykkuno, etc
He wanted to become like Charlie but he didn't know about the orang strat
Mr High IQ is back with a +100 IQ in the book, very nice
0 DISLIKES BUFF
The animations were so cute !
No way this is happening.
toast is sus >.>
Omggg
"This is harder than my lobbies maaan." As a person who often plays public lobbies, I kinda agree lol
Run out money ?
The Legend is Back🤧🤧
Ahh, Nostalgia from a year ago. Definitely helped me through a rough time.
Public lobbies give me migraines.
good to see you back in youtube toast
You're not rusty, Public lobbies are just.......yeah you see they don't think
Play more Amoug us please!!!!!!!!
YOW YOW YOW YOW YOW. I MISS THIS DUDE
Please post some tft :(
The cute animations are back!!! (/;w;)/
This has the same vibes as if a highschooler went back to kindergarten
YAAAASSSSS
all in a days work
You should join an among us server so you can use vc
Missed this so much
The animations make this even better haha
You're back!
TIS THE SEASON 😭😭😭❤️
classic toast amongus, gets voted out for safety smh
btw look how happy toast is.... lollllll
I MISSED THE ANIMATIONS
Wait, didn't toast said he'll retire one year after he plays among us again?!
I haven’t even seen it, but my day has been made and I’m crying 😭😭😭
You have to do tasks to get the vitals back lol     Oh and  if you change the percentage and number of roles it's way more fun lol
among us!
apparently i look like disguised toast... O.o so i had to come look to be sure.....
KIIIIING!!! HE HAS RETURNED TO RECLAIM THE THRONE!  1.) Loving the new end card 2.) I missed Frost's animations
THE RETURN OF THE KING
THIS MUST BE A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR EVERYONE WHO LOVES TOAST PLAYING AMONG US
The ending after winning as imp was too funny lol
I wish he didn't use quick chat :(
Yessss
amgong us man is back
I MISSED YOU!
Happy to see uploads again.
Ah yes the "Dance Little Man" music is back.
RETURN OF THE KING!!!
Rather play goose goose duck
ohhh toast is back for real ?
amogusamogus
OH MY LORD
I was just whining about how I won’t wake up to another toast video… little did I know
"WHERE?" 🤣🤣
He’s backkkkkkkk
The king return 👍 late happy B. Toast 😉
the editor really busted out the old amongus things eh
My Precious.......
I thought this was from Toast's fan channel lol
Why is he so against playing among us? I mean, asking that on his latest among us video sounds kinda dumb, but you get my point, I hope.
4:25 the blue guy hiding top right in shields
You don't know how happy it made me he won the imposter round 😂
Goddamn Toast his looking hot.
Guess who’s back back again toast back tell a friend
I miss the animations.. more animation.. any content would do
YESSSS
Public lobbies are just horrible
I hope this means he might be willing to play it with otvf again. The dynamic in the group and chat between was always the best part to me, doesn’t feel the same with random people just writing, as funny as toast is making fun of them with all these nonsensical and sarcastic comments.
Oh how I missed the among us animation🤣❤️
THE TOAST THEME SONG THANK GOD LETS GOOOOOOO 🙏
Welcome back!
HES BACK
Toast Vs Public Lobbies 2021 In the end, it’s easier to play with friends. Welcome back Toast!
Public lobbies are crazy
I thought this was an old video I hadn't seen until I saw the date...
I was there😁
Toast: Yo, what's up? Lobby: ...
<3
AMOGUS?
algorithim
The background music, big brain IQ, the animation, getting voted out on 5.. 🥺
AMONGUUUUSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
The return of the king
CANT BELIEVE I AM SEEING THIS
how’d you know i was rewatching ur among us videos
The real Toast stopped playing. I think this is an impostor.
it's quite fum to see him revisit among us at this point
Holy shit i thought this was a reuploaded by a fan channel omg. Welcome back toast!
The players in the lobbies that played with "Lankybat" and are watching this must be flipping out.
Are king is back to demolish everyone
The legend is back!
there ain't know way boi !!!
You know you are playing with random lobbies when they turn the movement speed up way too high, and have vision range super high as well
The king is back
HOLY SHIT I DOUBLE CHECKED WHEN I READ IT AS DISGUISED TOAST POSTED IT OMG I JUST WOKE UP I REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO FEEL LIKE IM HALLUCINATING 😭
Guys he might not have returned he said among us was taking a mental toll on him remember this must be a video to remember the good times
Toast! Toast! Do An Elden Ring Let's Play!
Do you know why he did that posture at the end of the video? Thats right, because it took him like 50 tries, because public lobbies are absolutely deaf towards any logic at all... When I played public lobbies, winning was about sheer luck both as crew and impostor because as imp your partner gets himself caught round 1 or 2 and you work alone rest of the game. As crew lotta people dc because they didnt get a role and you insta lose. When I played custom lobbies 8 crewmates 2 impostors I was winning every single game except like one out of 10. Because all of a sudden people were talking and it was about logic. But welcome to the dark side Toast, welcome!
AMOGUS MAN IS BACK COMRADES
When your friends don't wanna play with you so you play in public lobbies
He's back
Amogus
HES BACK
Hey toast thanks for coming back! We missed you!
Ain't no stress if it ain't your friends.
It'd be amazing if the old lobby reunited again in Among Us a year later.
What can I say" The King is back"
Great editing, frost! Miss these kinds of vids with animations 💜💜
😭😭😭😭 finally the king has returned more oh great leader more among us bring your friends 15 people in lobby this would be funny
IT IS HAPPENING.. EVERYBODY CALM  JUST STAY CALM..  😅😅
So what I heard was, "see you in 6 months"
PLSS COME BACK WITH TFT
Thank goodness toast didn’t try to join account lobbies, I can only imagine if he had to experience the absurd quantities of Snapchat advertisers and mha roleplayers that are just everywhere in this game.
LETS GOOOO
OMGGGG,WELCOMEEEE BACKKKK!!!!!!!!
He lost weight omg
me already watched this from 5 other clip channels: *I am speed*
I know it's only been like a year, but God the nostalgia. I used to watch every Amongus video Toast put out religiously
The edits are so funny ( ◜‿◝ )♡ I'm not gonna touch among us for another six months ಥ‿ಥ
DA KING IS BACK
Toast is legit so adorable I don't get why some people hate him or say he's rude T^T
Damn it's already the end of 2022?
When you playing with people publicly they don't listen plus it's hard to discuss with the new update
Public lobbies are so fucking toxic 😂😭😂
"No innocent person would vote themselves" -looks at Sykkuno- I wouldn't be so sure
TOOOOAST SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!!! Hope youre well!!
WOOOOOOOOO I'M SO EXCITED HE'S BACK
The one and only has returned! 💜 Love the videos please don't leave for another 6 months.
Hi toast!
So glad Toast is back!
i hope you are going to upload more among us
TOAST YOU'RE BAAACK!
I just finished the podcast where he says he may return to among us end 2022 lol
THE KING.. HAS RETURNED!
Hope you keep doing this
The King is back
The animation is as cute as always
He really made public Among Us lobbies FUN o.o Toast, I've missed youuuu!
NO he is not back.
Toast just needs to occasionally flex that he's a god detective/assassin at Among Us, even in retirement.
I miss these.  I know every trend has its day in the sun and people move on, but it’s he amigops amung us days were fun
Youre not rusty. More like lots of no brainers in the public lobby. I cannot deal with that 🤧
When I say I’m ✨ in love… ✨
I was in one of the games he played my name was Tuxful
yoh!!!!
The IQ...
its so frustrating just how stupid some people are
the 20,500 IQ video is finally here!!!
AMONGUS
ayy among us returning makes me nostalgic and happy :3 also wtf there's roles now?! haven't played in so long- didn't know inner sloth kept updating
A a a a a a aaaaamong us????
Boi
Sheeeeesh Sherlock is back <3
WELCOME BACK TOAST! <3

It's just that easy
Wait when did he play this?
Its really starting to look more and more like a kids game

Oh I missed laughing like that 😂
OMG IM SO HAPPY ITS BACK!

Among Us Christmas Special

Wut, I thought you said you'll never return to Among Us?
I MISS ALL OF THESE EVEN JUST ONCE THANKS TOAST
HOLY SJSJEKSNSMSMSSHIT
Go into a public discord lobby and pretend to be toast
LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!
Sherlock Toast is back!
THE GREAT RETURN!!!!!!!
Btw i miss the tiny crews i love seeing them again
THE KING THE LEGEND IS BACK! POGGERS
WOHO! He's back!
One of the best thing in this game was the argumentation during the meetings. Now the only possible way to play Among us is with friends...
Play tft again dude.
People still play this? lol
Return of the king!
I think he wants more money lol
Toast sign in your to access typing
AYYYY OUR AMONG US KING IS BACKKK
The king is back but i think only for some time i think
Never realized how much i missed those animations till now
He's back!!!
I was so happy until the ending 😢 I guess we wait 6 months boys!
The King of IQ Plays is back!! ♥️♥️♥️
Holy shit an Among us video
I smiled straight for an hour when I saw this
HE'S BACK AAAAAAAAAAA
TOOOAAAAST I MISSED YOUUUUUU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is like prime 2020 again im genuinely happy man! 🤣
I cant believe I’m actually watching this rn lmfao
LIES
its really chaotic now
NOOOOO NOT 6 MONTHS
Let's goooooooo!!
man I missed these animations! it felt like forever since I last saw them, yet they're still as cute as before!
POG
What happened to, end of 2022. Also no hat in the YouTube logo?
Pubic lobbies in Among us make me believe humans are a mistake!!!
imagine if he goes back to hearthstone
You mean, you played ONE game on stream. KEKW
'no innocent person would vote for themself.' sykkuno:
The innocent “Where?” animation with the lime crewmate had me dying 😂
Playing public lobbies is like trying to find gold from a dumpster.
Time to get the band back together.
Public lobbies are so painful
is there special roles without mods?
lets show some love to this video guys, don't forget to like!
i thought the Sus vanished from this channel but the Sus has found its ways back
YESSS! HE'S BACKKK!
Return of the King
Toast: No Innocent person who would vote for Himself  *Sykkuno: Alright I'm gonna vote my self
I missed this :) Refreshing :) <3
Tuxful.
EYYYY!!! AMONGUSSSSS
I miss your amogus lobbies
From this video I have deduced that public lobbies are absolute toxic wastelands xD.
Here you dropped this 👑
KING OF AMONG US
Pog
I have mixed feelings about the new icon
Sussy
he still has it damn
*amogus*
*Return of the King* What a great birthday present to me
Public Lobbies have 0 iq, thats why I quit Among Us ;—;
Wtf?
Pog
Bow down, for the King has returned
Among us played a large part in killing itself
Lets get it!!! The man the myth the legend himself has returned. If there is a god hes on our side today. Absolute value of o.
I am missing the Animation so much
amunggus
That looks like every public lobby
Imagine watching this and realizing you played with toast haha
Wherever you run, wherever hide, the Among Us catches you, and you shall not escape its hardened grasp, for the Among Us is everlasting as the eternal souls trapped within its dark confines.
this is crazy because i’ve been binging all of his old videos since i miss him so much
Oh my ghaaaddddd
I remember multiple times when you said you would come back in exactly 1 year from your last game. But by the way, about what you said to Jae when talking about among us, like how people have high "expectations" from your high iq and stuff, but.. that's not the case, I remember old toast once said "Guys, it's never a big brain play by Toast, I'm just catching impostors" and that's the Toast we want, regardless if it's in 1 year or not.
wait what? i haven't play among us in a while there are roles??
The nature is healing
I miss the Among Us animations : (
Feels like the game changed a little too much?
OH GAAAHD! I MISS THIS AMONG US VIDEOS!! 😭😭😭
TOAST THE KING IS BACK
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Please upload normal videos among us isn’t fun at all anymore
WELCOME BACK KING 👑👑👑
Podcast: I don't think I'm going to touch Among Us until late 2022. Among Us video releases the next day.  I'm glad Toast said he had fun near the end of the video though, he shouldn't continue to grind Among Us if he's not having fun.
No innocent person would vote themselves *Leslie: ''SYYYKUNNOOOOO!!!!''
Algorithm
Toast: Orange is sus, nobody would vote themselves if they're innocent.  Sykunno: Toast? Am I a joke to you? 🤭
WE NEED MORE AMONG US
Toast not only playing among us but playing PUBLIC LOBBIES TOO??
oooooo interesting
Is it me or has Toast  lost some weight?
HE IS BACK HELL YEAH
hes back
Yay both toast and frostrune returned!
Among us is dead now but why did I get shook when I saw this title 😳 make the game great again?
Everyone raised into a frenzy for the 20000 IQ king.
Damn the ludwig grindset is sure to bring you success
TOAST PLAY MOGUS ?! RETURN OF THE KING
"Return of The King"
I will never get tired of your among us content
Oh god
Finally found what I'm thankful for this year. THIS
Finally upload
Play with friends and maybe try all the mods they are a breathe of fresh air in the otherwise stale game
The return of an era!!!
Boring without voice
Funny how you accused blue and cyan and then the next game it’s you and blue as imps
So it’s back to this
OMGGGG
Those animations so cute!
holy shit- toast in among us again?
AHH CLASSIC
I miss your daily Among Us videos. They were part of my daily routine. Thanks, Toast.
pub lobbies make toast - 100000 iq ;-;
The king with over 20k IQ has come back
PLEASE MORE
TOAST!!!!!!
Among us was never been the same without you Mr.Toast 🙏🏼
Man I missed the animations!
somebody pinch me I must be dreaming!
He's so exited.. this is adorable 😩
The animations are always so on point and funny af, good job to the animator and editor
Brooooo THIS IS AINT HAPPENING AAAAAAAAA Edit: He now practicing among us for (maybe) another collab 👀
I think he's worse in public lobbies not because he's rusty, but because he can't psychoanalyse public players.
Its been a while toast. Welcome back
Is Toast on Twitch? I thought he had a deal with Facebook but that looks a lot like Twitch chat
AMONG US 😈🍔🤠🤠🤮🤮🎉🤔🤔🙄🤓🙂😎😎😳👌😡😡🤣🤣🤣🙏🦃🍫😁👶👽🍔👶👶👶👽👽😈🙄🙄🤓🎉🤓🤓🙂🙂😀😀🙂😎😎😎😳🤮🤮👎🥪😊😱😧🎮🎮🎮🕹🥓🥩
s
This thanksgiving is a little… sus
Whatever he uploads, the combination of Toast and Among is Unbreakable!
Nice toast I like that type of video
Love how toast is now a boomer in among us So ironic
IT be like that in public lobbies
I hadn't seen him since his last among us video, how did he lose so much weight? Is this even the same guy?
Can't believe it's already been a year since the among us era, dang. I found all my comfort streamers because of it
Imagine being a guy in a public lobby and later find out you had Disguised Toast in your team
The return of the king!
We getta make this trending.  FOR THE KINGGGGGG
It’s an early Christmas for sure!
The animation is just much much better. 😍 I miss you Toasty Boy! ❤
HE IS BACKKKKK
Wondering whether we will get to see Toast in the new maps
I always used to watch the facebook streams early in the morning. The vids got me through the pandemic even at my darkest times. It was truly a lifesaver.
Toast we're starving
The king is backkk!!!!!!
Please upload more among us content
The goat is back
tried Among Us public lobbies for a day and used my 2100 IQ brain   i saw the rest of the title was missing dont worry these things happen sometimes
Welcome back the one guy not invited to play on Jimmy Kimmel
This was the funniest thing ever to me
even in a public lobby Toast is the safe vote on 5 😂
See you in 6 months Toast
Ayyy the goat is back at it again
I was literally thinking about how I missed your gaming videos then you uploaded Among us
and this is why i never play public lobbies people have like 0 IQ
Sus
HES BACK
22 minute crew  Perceived 364th comment
THE ANIMATION 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This guy has clearly never been in a public lobby
Ah shit here we go again...
sussy
they kinda ruined among us by changing the chat like that
wtf i just started rewatching amount us
Did someone say amongus...👀👀
HES BACK THE KING HAS RETURNED
amogus notif? WAHT😮
Why is this so entertaining
I WAS IN THIS GAME I WAS SUNNY SUN I CANT BELIEVE IT OMG
I went back to among us yesterday and I’m so glad that I had stopped playing it just so annoying in public lobbies
THE KING HAS RETURNED TO HIS CASTLE
Is this an among us channel again? Or will he be doing different content
This just gave me chillssss 😭😭😭😭😭
two uploads in two days, you spoil us disguised toast
sus
Toast has returned.
He still got it
OH SNAP :D
Ooh, among us content every 6 months, poggers
Chat is terrible on among us . WELCOME BACK TOASTIE
Holyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
toast back here again with something he thought he could escape. not so easily, toast, not so easily. it's ok for toast to not have to come back to among us, though.
Imagine if they finally implemented proximity chat
Toast getting voted out after catching the impostor red handed. Some things never change.
Legend is back 🔥🔥🔥
this is unexpected 😀
I clicked this shiz FAST
I'm just glad he's posting on YT again!
I love the fact that he is actually enjoying this because noone really accuse him like all the time lol
Hai
OMG The king is back!!!!
No it needs to stop among us is dead let it die
The return of the king
This is what I deal with since I hate talking to people and don’t have many friends. Luckily I did find a friend group that only use typing. Anyway welcome back Toast to the among us. Things have changed quiet a bit
is this a fever dream?
Toast: "I'm still worthy"
That “still go it” likeee yaass, it’s an innate skill for u, TOAST‼️‼️
Toast is too powerful in this game
Who’s the imposter, maybe it’s u, maybe it’s u, maybe maybe it’s u
omg THIS IS NOT A DRILL OMG OMG OMG
There are roles :0
He maybe the smartest Among Us player. But, the randomness of public lobbies got him  Also, I miss the animation so much
sus
Among us witouth normal chat is so trash
Can we appreciate that Gyazturk med it into the animated segment in a Toast video?!?
Never clicked on a vid and liked it so fast
Everybody: so great to see you play among us again dude!  Toast: time to not touch anong us for another 6 months
the man, the myth, the legend is back
I miss it already
this just puts a smile on my face a big smile
Christmas miracle 😭😭😭😭
Toast is just playing them in his hands
Oh myyyyy goooodddddd😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
long time no see
I am sorry that I did not found out about you all earlier i missed all the great among us moments :(
This is funny 😂
If Toast decided to take the Among Us series to 20000 IQ you can bet I'd watch it all
The king is back 👑
Toast: “Gyazturk you one of the good ones. I’ll follow you around.”  Meanwhile: Gyazturk is trying to do 02 as a task Toast: “ I’ll make sure nothing bad happens to you buddy.
Dad
11mins late for some reason..aight
THE KING HAS RETURNED👑
Oh dear.
AYO I HAVENT WATCHED U FOR SO LONG U HAVE LOST SO MUCH WEIGHT CONGRATS
Disguised Toast is back lessgo
It would be funny if he sings “ who’s the imposter, maybe it’s you, maybe it’s you, maybe maybe it’s you” during the game 😅
Well, this was a fast upload!
Please not another 6 months
He has returned.
I didn't realize you were back!
You can NOT just give us a taste and say not playing among us for another 6 months that is just cruel. Think of the children 👦
WHOO LET'S GOOOO
All hail the king
“never playing among us ever again” sure sureeeeeeee of course you aren’t
TOAST HAS RETURNED??
Poor Tuxful
OMG! HES BACK!!!!!!!
THE KING HAS RETURNED!!!!!!!
Seeing Toast back on Among Us after so long Is great, have really missed his videos
I missed this kind of animation and thumbnail!!!!!!!!
Oh Toast uploaded again! Time to check this out- "Public Lobbies." *OH NO*
The king has returned to the spaceship
What so more Among us?!!!! Honored to be here
Is it me, or has toast got a lot skinnier?
First
AGONGUS
It just isn’t the same anymore
This was great to watch lol
He's back Pog
I'm so sorry that you played in public servers
He said he wouldn't return till next August and he kinda did. But I assume since it's public lobbies it doesn't count lol.
The King has returned no IQ ? That’s okay 🤧
nostalgic
7:47 I LOVE THIS ANIMATION
Lol he wasn’t even logged in in order to get the beans Toast you need the beans
Its cool that toast came back kinda but man this video also shows how bad the game has become, one bad update ruined one very amazing game and It is depressing
Still milking this game..come on now!
lessssss gooooooooooo toast is back and uploading games
Is it just me or has toast been working on himself
The great wizard toast playing with muggles
